By employing first-principles computations
and particle-swarm optimization
calculations, we theoretically confirmed the honeycomb geometry of
experimentally realized BC3 sheet, which is constructed
by the hexagonal carbon-ring fragments surrounded by six boron atoms
and has pronounced thermodynamic stabilities. Remarkably, the computations
also demonstrate the visible-light absorption, high carrier mobilities,
and promising reduction and oxidation capacities of the BC3 monolayer, indicating its efficient absorption of solar radiation,
fast migration of electron and holes, and excellent capabilities of
photoinduced carriers in a photocatalytic process, respectively. Additionally,
its indirect band gap, spatially separated charge distributions, and
great difference in mobilities of electrons and holes should lead
to the restricted recombination of photoactivated e––h+ pairs within BC3 monolayer. All
above-mentioned characteristics suggest that the honeycomb BC3 monolayer should be a recommendable candidate for metal-free
photocatalysts, which is worthy of further verifications and explorations
in experimental studies.

1 Introduction
Since
the first experimental report on water splitting at a TiO2 photoelectrode,1 great success
has been achieved in high-performance photocatalysts over the past
decades and accordingly, the photocatalytic technologies have been
well developed as one of the most hopeful strategies for overcoming
the global energy crisis and environmental problems.2 Varieties of photoactive materials, especially nanostructured
semiconductors with promising photochemical characteristics, were
synthesized and proven excellent photocatalysts for the degradation
of organic pollutants, hydrogen production from water splitting, reduction
of the heavy metal ion and carbon dioxides, green synthesis of chemicals,
etc.3

Sparked by the discovery of
graphene, a great number of two-dimensional
(2D) materials possessing sheetlike structures with only single- or
few-atom thickness have been experimentally realized, which leads
to the growing research interest in exploring the novel characteristics
and potential applications of these unique 2D materials.4 When the 2D materials are used as photocatalysts,
they exhibit several intrinsic advantages for improving the photocatalytic
efficiency, including the high specific surface area for light absorption,
abundant reactive sites available for photocatalytic reaction, reduced
migration distance and promoted separation of photoactivated e––h+ pairs, conveniently regulable
electronic and optical properties, and so on.5 Compared with the bulk materials, numerous experimental studies
have found the superiority of 2D photocatalysts that can indeed lead
to the improved activities in photocatalysis.6 For instance, the freestanding SnS2 single layer exhibited
high photocurrent density of 2.75 mA cm–2, which
is over 70 times higher than that of bulk SnS2. The SnS2 nanosheet generated a much greater incident photon to converted
electron (IPCE) ratio (38.7%) than that of bulk SnS2 (2.33%)
at an irradiation wavelength of 420 nm.6a Moreover, Xie et al. also fabricated flexible and freestanding zinc
chalcogenide single layers and found the ZnSe nanosheet demonstrates
a 200 times greater photocurrent density (2.14 mA cm–2) and 170 times higher IPCE ratio (42.5%) compared to those of bulk
ZnSe, respectively.6b

The probable
high cost of noble metals, metal release and poor
stability in electrolyte, and environmental toxicity of the metal-containing
photocatalytic nanomaterials may place serious restrictions on their
practical utilization.7 For appropriate
alternatives to the metal-based semiconductors, a great number of
metal-free semiconducting materials have been experimentally synthesized
or theoretically proposed as attractive photocatalysts, including
the elemental semiconductors8 and nonmetal
compounds.9 Remarkably, since the 2D metal-free
polymeric carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) were synthesized
and first utilized as efficient photocatalysts for hydrogen production
from water, the g-C3N4 photocatalyst has attracted
tremendous research interest and achieved great success due to its
superiority in being earth-abundant, nontoxic, highly stable in both
alkaline and acidic solution, and independent of noble metals.10

In view of the great achievements of 2D
metal-free g-C3N4 photocatalytic materials,
a question arises naturally;
is there any other 2D metal-free semiconductor that can be utilized
as a highly efficient, nontoxic, and environmentally friendly photocatalyst?
With this problem, we prescreened some metal-free graphenelike materials
and found that the BC3 nanosheet may be a good candidate
for metal-free photocatalysis. The metallic BC3 crystal
with graphitelike structure was first synthesized through interaction
of boron trichloride with benzene at 800 °C: 2BCl3 + C6H6 → 2BC3 + 6HCl. The
electron micrographs showed that the BC3 is a homogeneous
product with a sheetlike character and the sheets are seen to be 3–4
Å apart.11 Similar to the fabrication
of graphene, the BC3 nanosheets may be easily obtained
through physical/chemical exfoliation from bulk crystal, chemical
vapor deposition method, or epitaxial growth on the substrate lattice.
Yanagisawa et al. found that a microscopic uniform sheet of BC3 with excellent crystalline quality can be epitaxially grown
on the NbB2(001) surface through carbon-substituted technique
in a boron honeycomb.12 Moreover, by employing
the ab initio pseudopotential local-orbital method, this graphenelike
BC3 monolayer was theoretically predicted to be a semiconductor
with an energy gap of 0.66 eV, which could have visible-light absorptions.
Therefore, the experimentally feasible BC3 nanosheets may
be one of the unexplored photocatalysts with earth-abundant elements
and promising photoactivities, implying that it is essential to further
investigate the intrinsic characteristics, especially the photochemical
properties, of the BC3 nanosheet for exploring the potential
metal-free photocatalysts.

Through first-principles computations
and global minimum search
using particle-swarm optimization (PSO) method, we herein theoretically
analyzed possible geometries and photoactivities of BC3 monolayer. Among the three geometries from PSO computations, the
global minimum structure of BC3 (GM-BC3) monolayer,
which is composed of the fragments of hexagonal carbon ring surrounded
by six boron atoms, has the best kinetic and thermal stabilities,
and accordingly, the GM-BC3 has the greatest possibility
to be the experimentally realized BC3 sheet. Moreover,
we also computed the electronic and optical properties of experimentally
obtained BC3 monolayer, namely, the GM-BC3 monolayer,
and evaluated its photocatalytic activities. The computational results
suggest that the GM-BC3 sheet has not only the broad visible-light
absorption but also efficient migration and separation of photoactivated
carriers, as well as the promising reduction and oxidation capacities
of electrons and holes, indicating that the BC3 monolayer
is a potential candidate for 2D metal-free photocatalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Possible Geometries of
the BC3 Monolayer
A comprehensive PSO search of
ground states was performed to explore
the global minimum structure of BC3 monolayer, which led
to three possibly stable structures. All theoretically predicted BC3 monolayers have honeycomb geometries (Figure 1). In the BC3-I monolayer, there
is C6 ring with regular hexagon geometry, which are surrounded
by six boron atoms. Both the B and C atoms within BC3-I
are equivalent to other homogeneous atoms, in which all boron atoms
are bonded with three carbon atoms, whereas each carbon atom is connected
to one boron and two carbon atoms. The BC3-II is composed
of BC5 or B2C4 hexagonal rings, in
which all B atoms are connected with three C atoms and C-2 atoms are
bonded with one C-1 and two C-3 atoms and each C-1 (C-3) is connected
with two B (C-2) and one C-2 (B) atoms. Dissimilarly, there are B–B
bonds parallel to one side of C6 hexagonal rings within
the BC3-III monolayer. The B atoms are equivalent to each
other, and C atoms can be classified into C-4 and C-5, which also
have different coordinations. Notably, the computed cohesive energies
of BC3-I, BC3-II, and BC3-III defined
as Ecoh = (xEB + 3xEC – xEBC3)/4x were also computed, where EB, EC, and EBC3 are total energies of a single
B, a single C, and one unit cell of the BC3 monolayer.
The BC3-I, BC3-II, and BC3-III monolayer
have cohesive energies of 6.86, 6.54, and 6.43 eV per atom, respectively,
indicating the strongest connection between the boron and carbon atoms
in the three predicted BC3 monolayers. Relatively, the
BC3-I has the lowest energy and thus may be the global
minimum structure of BC3 sheets.

Figure 1 Relaxed geometries of
three BC3 monolayers predicted
by CALYPSO. Blue dashed lines present the crystal lattices, whereas
the red-line frameworks are guidelines for the B2C6 unit cell.

To assess the kinetic
stabilities of these BC3 monolayers,
the phonon dispersions were computed along the high-symmetry lines
in the first Brillouin zone (Figure 2). There is no appreciable imaginary frequency in the
phonon spectrum of BC3-I monolayer, implying the kinetic
stability of this geometry (Figure 2a). The highest frequency in the phonon spectrum can
reach up to 1518 cm–1, which indicates the robust
B–C interaction in the BC3-I monolayer. However,
the obvious negative frequencies in the phonon spectra of BC3-II and BC3-III monolayer suggest their kinetic instability.
According to the results of cohesive energies and phonon dispersion,
the BC3-I geometry with the lowest total energy and greatest
cohesive energy is the global minimum and the most kinetically stable
structure and thus has the greatest feasibility in experiments, which
agree well with the experimental and theoretical predictions.12 Therefore, only the global minimum structure,
namely the BC3-I monolayer, was further computed to uncover
its structural, electronic, and optical properties and to evaluate
the feasibility of its photocatalytic application. All “BC3” mentioned in the following discussion represent the
BC3-I structure.

(b) BC3-II,
and (c) BC3-III monolayer.

The thermal stability of BC3 monolayer was further
tested
by performing the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations
on a relatively large 4 × 4 supercell (32 boron and 96 carbon
atoms) at the temperatures of 500, 800, 1200, and 1500 K. Snapshots
of the geometries at the end of 10 ps simulation are represented in Figure 3. The framework of
BC3 is well kept in its original configuration with tightly
connected B–C bonds at the temperature of 1500 K (Figure 3d), demonstrating
the promising thermal stability of BC3 monolayer.

BC3 equilibrium structures at the temperatures
of (a) 500 K, (b) 800 K, (c) 1200 K, and (c) 1500 K at the end of
10 ps AIMD simulations.

For deep insights into the unique bonding nature and stabilizing
mechanism of BC3 monolayer, the electron localization function
(ELF) calculation13 was performed. The
ELF is useful for the classification of chemical bonds and can effectively
describe the electron localization in molecules and solids. Generally,
the ELF values of 1.0 and 0.5 designate the completely localized and
delocalized electrons, respectively, whereas a value approaching 0
denotes very low charge density.14 The
isosurface of ELF for BC3 monolayer was plotted at the
isosurface value of 0.30 au, and the ELF values at different regions
are visualized by colors in ELF maps (Figure S1). The ELF results suggest that the electrons within BC3 are well delocalized and homogeneous electron gas is evenly distributed
in the whole B–C framework. The well-delocalized electrons
in this BC3 monolayer should lead to a robust connection
between the boron and carbon atoms. Additionally, the blue region
in the ELF map suggests the electron deficiency around the boron atoms
and at the center of the hexagonal C6 rings, implying the
electron transfer from B to C atoms and thus the strong covalent B–C
and C–C bonds. The electrons accumulated at the center of B–C
and C–C bonds, indicated by the red region of ELF map, demonstrate
the possible σ bonds in this BC3 system. Therefore,
due to the completely delocalized electrons and strongly connected
boron and carbon atoms, this 2D BC3 framework has promising
thermal and dynamic stabilities and is a reasonable structure of the
experimentally obtained BC3 sheet.12

2.2 Electronic Structure and Optical Properties
To verify the possibility of photocatalytic application, band structure
of BC3 monolayer was computed to investigate its semiconducting
characteristics. According to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) computational results, the BC3 monolayer is a semiconductor
with an indirect gap of 0.64 eV (Figure S2), which agrees well with the results of previous theoretical studies
(0.62–0.66 eV).15 In view of the
underestimated band gaps by PBE functional, the hybrid density functional
theory (DFT) method of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)
functional was used to calculate the electronic structures of the
BC3 monolayer (Figure 4a). The HSE06 computational results also demonstrate
the indirect gap of this boron carbide system, which indicates the
different positions of electrons and holes in momentum space and accordingly
the restricted recombination of photoactivated electrons and holes
with different momentums.16 The conduction-band
minimum (CBM) and valence-band maximum (VBM) are located at M and
Γ point, respectively. The CBM is composed of B-p and C-p states,
and the VBM mainly consists of p orbital of the C carbons (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 (a) Band structures (left)
and projected density of states (PDOS)
(right), as well as (b) the imaginary parts of dielectric constants
for the BC3 monolayer, computed by HSE06 functionals. The
green dashed line in the band structure represents the Fermi level
at 0 eV, whereas the red dashed line tangent to ε2 curves is used to determine the optical gap of BC3 monolayer.

The band gap of 1.83 eV suggests
the visible-light absorption of
the BC3 monolayer, which is a great advantage when it was
used as photocatalyst. To confirm its visible-light absorption, we
computed the dielectric constants of BC3 monolayer and
found that this 2D boron carbide has an optical gap of 2.01 eV and
thus pronounced visible-light absorption. The high peak of absorption
spectrum at 2.53 eV and large area under the ε2 curve
at the visible-light region (<3.0 eV) demonstrate high absorption
coefficients at these frequencies and accordingly high-efficiency
visible-light absorption (<414 nm) of BC3 monolayer.
Therefore, the BC3 monolayer could be a potential visible-light
responsive semiconductor for high-performance nonmetal photocatalysis,
solar harvesting process, or other light-emitting devices.

Besides
the light absorption, the separation efficiency of photoactivated
electron and holes is also a significant factor in the photocatalytic
activities of BC3 monolayer. Because most photogenerated
electrons and holes are locating at the CBM and VBM of the semiconductor,
the spatial distribution of photoactivated electron and holes depends
on the real-space locations of CBM and VBM, respectively. Accordingly,
we computed the spatial distributions of CBM and VBM for BC3 monolayer to further analyze the separation efficiency of the photoinduced
carriers (Figure 5).
For the investigated BC3 monolayer, the VBM at Γ
point mainly consist of p states of carbon atoms whereas the CBM at
M point is predominantly comprised of p orbitals of boron atoms, which
is in good consistence with the PDOS results (Figure 4a). Additionally, the spatial charge distributions
of CBM and VBM mainly locating around boron and carbon atoms suggest
that the photoactivated electrons and holes should be predominantly
distributed around the B and C atoms, respectively, implying the spatially
separated photoinduced e––h+ pairs
within the BC3 sheet.

CBM and (b) VBM spatial
distribution at Γ and M point within BC3 monolayer,
respectively. The isosurfaces value is set at 0.016 au.

2.3 Redox Capacities and Carrier
Mobilities of
Electrons and Holes
The redox potential of photogenerated
electrons and holes is another predominant factor that has a remarkable
impact on the activities of photocatalysts. Consequently, the band
edge position of BC3 monolayer was also computed to further
analyze its reduction and oxidation capacities. The band edge alignments
were determined by the CBM/VBM energy levels relative to the vacuum
levels set at 0 eV. For a hypothetical example, if the vacuum level
is calculated to be 1.5 eV, the CBM level at −3.6 eV should
be determined at −(3.6 + 1.5) = −5.1 eV relative to
the vacuum level at 0 eV.

The redox potential of a normal hydrogen
electrode (ENHE), which equals to −4.5
V with respect to the absolute vacuum scale (EAVS = 0 V), is often utilized as a reference to evaluate the
redox capacities of carriers. Generally, the valence-band holes with
chemical potential of +1.0 to +3.5 V (vs ENHE) are good oxidants, whereas the conduction-band electrons with chemical
potential varying from +0.5 to −1.5 V (vs ENHE) should have impressive reduction capabilities.17 Our computations suggest that the chemical potentials
of conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes are +0.15 and
+1.98 V (vs ENHE), respectively, implying
the promising reduction and oxidation capacities of photogenerated
electrons and holes within BC3 monolayer (Figure 6). Especially, the holes within
BC3 have redox potential (+1.98 V) comparable to those
of other high-performance photocatalysts, such as the g-C3N4 (+1.97 V), holey C2N (+2.05 V), etc. Therefore,
the activated BC3 photocatalysts could directly capture
the electrons and thus oxidize the organic pollutants or other reactants.
The chemical potential of electrons at +0.15 V (vs ENHE) belonging to the numerical interval of +0.5 to −1.5
V (vs ENHE) also suggests the possible
reduction capability of activated electrons, which could reduce the
heavy metal ions or other reactants.

Figure 6 Band edge positions of BC3 monolayer,
TiO2, g-C3N4, and holey C2N crystals.
The redox potentials of H+/H2 (Φ(H+/H2) = 0 vs ENHE) and
H2O/O2 (Φ(H2O/O2) = 1.23 vs ENHE) at pH = 0 are also
given as a reference.

Compared with the excellent oxidation capability of holes,
performance
of electrons in reduction process may be not that impressive. However,
the band alignment could be engineered through the introduction of
impurity dopants, crystal defects, heterostructure nanosheets, biaxial
strain, and so on, which is worthy to attempt.18 For instance, the uniaxial strains not only result in varying
band structures and band gaps of BC3 but also lead to the
variation of band alignments (Figure S3). The BC3 monolayer with uniaxial strain of 3, 4, and
5% at x direction has chemical potentials of electrons
at −0.02, −0.07, and −0.12 V (vs ENHE), respectively, implying the improved reduction capacities
of photoinduced electrons within these strained modified BC3 systems. Meanwhile, the chemical potentials of holes within BC3 with x direction strain of 3, 4, and 5%
are 2.02, 2.03, and 2.01 V (vs ENHE),
respectively, also indicating the tiny enhancement of their oxidation
capability (Figure S3a). The uniaxial strain
of −3, −4, and −5% at y direction
leads to the enhanced reduction capability of electrons but a little
poorer oxidation capacity of holes within the BC3 monolayer.
Notably, the BC3 monolayers with strain of 3, 4, and 5%
at x direction, as well as the strain of −3,
−4, and −5% at y direction, can simultaneously
reduce H+ and oxidize OH– to generate
H2 and O2.

Thanks to the highly developed
experimental methods and techniques,
tensile strains at an appropriate strength could be easily realized
in 2D materials. For instance, the graphene film to a circular mold
with a strain of 12% has been successfully fabricated by utilizing
the laser-induced shock pressure.19 By
adhering graphene to a bending PMDS substrate, a tensile strain of
18.7% was obtained in stretched graphene.20 By indenting the center of the graphene film with an atomic force
microscopy tip, Lee et al. observed strains up to 12% when measuring
the intrinsic strength of monolayer graphene.21 However, the experimental realization of compressing strain may
be not that easy, which should be further explored in future experimental
studies.

As another prerequisite for an excellent photocatalyst,
the carrier
mobilities of BC3 monolayer were computed to further evaluate
the efficiency of charge migration in this 2D material. By employing
the deformation potential (DP) theory, the carrier mobilities of BC3 monolayer were computed along x and y directions. The computational details of the stretching
modulus (C) and DP constant (E1) along armchair (x) and zigzag (y) directions are represented in Figure S4. The calculated values of C, E1, effective mass (m*), and carrier mobilities
are listed in Table 1. The electrons and holes within BC3 monolayer have carrier
mobilities of 2.09 × 102 and 5.13 × 104 cm2 V–1 S–1 along
the x direction, as well as 1.06 × 102 and 4.22 × 102 cm2 V–1 S–1 along the y direction, respectively,
which are comparable to those of MoS2 single-layer transistors
(ca. 200 cm2 V–1 S–1).22 Remarkably, the carrier mobility
of holes along x direction (5.13 × 104 cm2 V–1 S–1) reaches
up to a value approaching those of phosphorene (1.0–2.6 ×
104 cm2 V–1 S–1),23 which is a novel 2D material that
can be used in high-performance electronic devices.

|E1|, Effective
Mass |m*| and Carrier Mobilities μ along x and y Directions for Global Minimum Structure

 	C (N m–1)	|E1| (eV)	|m*| (me)	μ (cm2 V–1 S–1)	
electrons (x)	295.98	3.80	1.18	2.09 × 102	
holes (x)	295.98	9.54	0.03	5.13 × 104	
electrons (y)	303.01	5.04	1.26	1.06 × 102	
holes (y)	303.01	4.84	0.66	4.22 × 102	
These high values of carrier mobility should result
in fast movements
of photoinduced electrons and holes within BC3 monolayer,
and accordingly, the photoactivated e––h+ pairs can fast migrate to the surface and participate in
the electron-exchange reactions. It is noteworthy that the mobility
of holes can reach up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the electron
mobility in the armchair (x) direction, whereas the
holes have mobility about four times greater than that of electrons
along zigzag (y) direction. The dramatic difference
between mobilities of electrons and holes should result in their quite
different velocities and thus restrained recombination of photoinduced
e––h+ pairs along both the armchair
and zigzag directions.28

3 Conclusions
Through DFT computations and global minimum
search, we computed
the structural, electronic, and optical characteristics of BC3 monolayers, which were experimentally realized in 2004. The
computational results suggest that the BC3 monolayer containing
the fragments of hexagonal six-carbon rings surrounded by six boron
atoms is the global minimum structure, which has promising kinetic
and thermal stabilities and thus the greatest possibility to be the
experimentally obtained BC3 sheet.

The global minimum
structure of BC3 monolayer has an
electronic gap of 1.83 eV and an optical gap of 2.01 eV, indicating
its visible-light absorption. Moreover, the carrier mobility of holes
can reach up to 5.13 × 104 cm2 V–1 S–1 along x direction whereas
other carrier mobilities at x or y direction are comparable to those of MoS2 single-layer
transistors, which suggest the fast migration of photoinduced carriers
within the BC3 monolayer. The chemical potentials of CBM
and VBM at +0.15 and 1.98 eV (vs ENHE),
respectively, which can be further improved by uniaxial-strain modification,
demonstrate the promising reduction and oxidation capabilities of
the photogenerated electrons and holes in this BC3 sheet.
The BC3 monolayer even has the spatially separated charge
distribution of CBM and VBM, indirect band gap, and great difference
in the mobilities of electrons and holes, implying the spatially separated
distribution and effectively restricted recombination of photoinduced
e––h+ pairs. According to the
above-mentioned intrinsic properties, the BC3 monolayer
is a promising metal-free candidate for the green photocatalyst, which
is worthy of experimental confirmation and exploration.

4 Computational Details
Our periodic density functional theory
(DFT) computations were
carried out by employing the projector-augmented plane-wave24 method as implemented in the Vienna ab inito
simulation package (VASP)25 code. The electron-exchange-correlation
functional was described by the generalized gradient approximation
in the form proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).26 The tolerance for energy convergence was set
to 10–6 eV, whereas the ionic relaxation is converged
when the force on each atom was less than 10–3 eV
Å–1. The 500 eV cutoff for plane-wave basis
set was adopted in all computations. The Brillouin zone was integrated
by using Monkhorst–Pack generated sets of k-points. In the geometry relaxation and self-consistent computations,
15 × 15 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-points
mesh was used. In view of the underestimated band gaps by the PBE
functional, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)27 hybrid functional, which was proven a reliable
method for evaluating the electronic and optical properties,28 was employed to calculate the band structures
and dielectric constants of the BC3 monolayer. In the geometric
optimization process, the dipole correction has been considered and
there is no spin polarization in this BC3 system.

The particle-swarm optimization (PSO) method within the evolutionary
algorithm, as implemented in CALYPSO code,29 was employed to search for global minima of the BC3 monolayer
sheets. As an unbiased global optimization method, PSO algorithm has
successfully predicted highly stable structures of 2D materials.30 In our PSO calculations, the population size
is set to 50 and the number of generations was maintained at 30. Unit
cells containing total atoms of 4 (BC3), 8 (B2C6), and 16 (B4C12) were considered.
After complete relaxations of the required structure by using PBE
functional, as implemented in VASP code, three stable monolayers of
BC3, namely, BC3-I, BC3-II, and BC3-III, (Figure 1) were obtained. The BC3 monolayers were placed in the xy plane, with the z direction perpendicular
to the layer plane, and a vacuum space of 20 Å in the z direction was adopted to avoid interactions between adjacent
layers.

To evaluate the dynamic stability of three predicted
BC3 monolayers, phonon dispersion analysis was performed
by using the
Phonopy code31 interfaced with density
functional perturbation theory,32 as implemented
in VASP. The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations using
PBE functional were carried out to assess the thermal stabilities
of the lowest-energy BC3 monolayer. In the molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, a 4 × 4 supercell of BC3 containing
32 B atoms and 96 C atoms was annealed at temperatures of 500, 800,
1200, and 1500 K, respectively. The MD simulation in the NVT ensemble
lasted for 10 ps, with a time step of 2.0 fs, and the temperature
was controlled by employing the Nosé–Hoover method.33

To analyze the optical properties of the
lowest-energy BC3 monolayer, the frequency-dependent dielectric
matrix was calculated
by using the HSE06 functional and expanding over a 21 × 21 ×
1 k-point mesh. The complex dielectric constants
at a given frequency can be defined as ε(ω) = ε1(ω) +iε2(ω). The expression for
the absorption coefficient I(ω) was given as34 1  According to the equation, we can
obtain the
light absorbing information from the value of the imaginary part.
Only if the imaginary part ε2(ω) > 0, the
absorption
coefficient I(ω) was above zero. The imaginary
part is determined by a summation over empty states using the equation35 2  where the indices c and v represent conduction
and valence-band states, respectively, and uck⃗ is the cell periodic part of the
orbitals at the k point. A large number of empty
conduction-band states (almost twice more than the number of valence
bands) are included for the summation of eq 2.

The deformation potential theory was
applied to evaluate the carrier
mobility of 2D materials, which was derived from the following analytical
expression 3  where the temperature
(T)
was adopted at 300 K in this study and m* is the
effective mass of charge in the transport direction and defined as m* = ℏ2(∂2E(k)/∂k2)−1. C is the stretching modulus caused
by uniaxial strain, which is given by C = (∂2Etotal/∂ε2)/S0, where Etotal represents the total energy of a unit cell under different strengths
of uniaxial strain (ε) and S0 represents
the area of the optimized unit cell. E1 is the deformation potential (DP) constant of VBM for holes and
CBM for electrons, calculated by using E1 = ∂Eedge/∂ε. Eedge is the energy level of VBM or CBM along
the transport direction. e is the electron charge,
ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
