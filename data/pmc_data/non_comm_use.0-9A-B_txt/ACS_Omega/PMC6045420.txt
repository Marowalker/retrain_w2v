G-quadruplexes are higher order DNA structures that play significant roles in gene transcription and
telomeric maintenance. The formation and stability of the G-quadruplex
structures are under thermodynamic control and may be of biological
significance for regulatory function of cellular processes. Here,
we report the structural influence and energetic contributions of
the adenine bases in the loop sequences that flank G-repeats in human
telomeric DNA sequence. Spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques
are used to measure the thermal stability and thermodynamic contributions
to the stability of human telomeric G-quadruplexes that have been
designed with systematic changes of A to T throughout the telomeric
sequence. These studies demonstrate that the thermal stability of
the G-quadruplex structure is directly related to the number and position
of the adenines that are present in the telomeric sequence. The melting
temperature (Tm) was reduced from 59 °C
for the wild-type sequence to 47 °C for the sequence where all
four adenines were replaced with thymines (0123TTT). Furthermore,
the enthalpy required for transitioning from the folded to unfolded
G-quadruplex structure was reduced by 15 kcal/mol when the adenines
were replaced with thymines (37 kcal/mol for the wild-type telomeric
sequence reduced to 22 kcal/mol for the sequence where all four adenines
were replaced with thymines (0123TTT)). The circular dichroism melting
studies for G-quadruplex sequences having a single A to T change showed
significantly sloping pretransition baselines and their differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms revealed biphasic melting profiles.
In contrast, the deoxyoligonucleotides having sequences with two or
more A to T changes did not exhibit sloping baselines or biphasic
DSC thermograms. We attribute the biphasic unfolding profile and reduction
in the enthalpy of unfolding to the energetic contributions of adenine
hydrogen bonding within the loops as well as the adenine stacking
to the G-tetrads of the G-quadruplex structure.

Introduction
Guanine-rich nucleic acids are capable
of forming higher order
DNA structures called G-quadruplexes.1−4 Analyses of the human genome have established
the presence of a large number of highly conserved guanine-rich sequences
that have the potential to form G-quadruplex structures.5−7 These regions were found in certain oncogenic promoter regions and
at the telomeric ends of the chromosome, providing evidence for in
vivo biological functions of G-quadruplex structures. The potential
for G-quadruplex structures to serve regulatory functions have made
them attractive targets for the development of therapeutic drugs to
modulate genetic transcription and telomeric extension.6−9 At the core of the G-quadruplex structure are the planar G-tetrads
composed of four guanines that are held together by Hoogsteen bonding
and further stabilized by G-tetrad stacking. In vitro, G-quadruplexes
may be constructed via intermolecular or intramolecular interactions
of G-rich DNA sequences with significant variations in sequence and
molecularity. G-rich oligonucleotides of sufficient length have the
innate ability to form unimolecular G-quadruplexes that have demonstrated
a high degree of topological variations that are dependent on both
the base sequence and cationic environment.10,11

Human telomeric DNA is a noncoding region at the end of the
chromosome
that consists of repetitive sequences that are approximately 5–15
kb in length with the tandem repeat of 5′-(TTAGGG)n-3′. The terminal end of this sequence has
a 3′-single stranded overhang ranging from 35 to 600 nucleotides
in length that has been demonstrated to form stable G-quadruplex structures
both in vitro and in vivo.12−15 The formation of the G-quadruplex structure has been
demonstrated to inhibit the attachment of telomerase, thus halting
the enzymatic extension of the telomere that is often associated with
cancerous cells.16−18 The unimolecular human telomeric G-quadruplex structure
has three stacked G-tetrads connected by loops comprised of a 5′-TTA-3′
sequence. The focus of the work presented here probes the role of
the conserved adenine (in the 5′-TTA-3′ sequence) in
each of the loops in stabilizing the G-quadruplex structure. On the
basis of X-ray and NMR structural studies of the human telomeric G-quadruplex,
the adenines are postulated to provide stability through stacking of the purine base on the G-tetrads of the G-quadruplex
structures.19−24 To test this hypothesis, systematic replacement of each of the adenines
with thymines was followed by an extensive thermodynamic analysis
of the energetics of unfolding. These studies reveal the adenines
in the 5′-TTA-3′ loop sequences play a significant role
in G-quadruplex stability and folding topologies. The nature of the
loop connectivity gives rise to a number of alternate conformations
that have been characterized both by NMR and X-ray crystallography.
The most notable structural differences are between the sodium and
potassium cationic forms. Sodium-based buffers result in an all antiparallel
strand orientation with glycosidic bond angles in the anticonformation.
However, the loop connectivity may differ and be all lateral loops,
the “chair” conformation, or have two lateral loops
and one diagonal loop, the “basket” conformation.19,20 Both of these folding topologies and their loop connectivity are
illustrated in Figure 1. Potassium-based buffers result in more complex G-quadruplex structures
that are characterized by two lateral loops and one loop that shows
a chain reversal that is oriented on the edge of the tetrad core.
The result is a mixed strand polarity that has both antiparallel and
parallel characteristics with one guanine in a syn-conformation and
the remaining three in an anticonformation.21−24 Nevertheless, G-quadruplex structures
have the amazing ability to form topologically diverse structures
that are quite stable under biologically relevant temperatures and
conditions. The stabilities of G-quadruplex structures are derived
from contributions of the G-tetrad Hoogsteen base pairing and hydrophobic
stacking of successive G-tetrads.25,26

and the red circles represent the adenines.

The energetics of G-quadruplex unfolding and the enthalpic
(ΔHunfold) and entropic (ΔSunfold) contributions to the thermal stability
have been
reported by numerous research groups using a variety of biophysical
methods.18,25,27−29 There are variations in the unfolding energies reported for G-quadruplex
forming sequences. These variations arise from subtle differences
in base sequences as well as buffer conditions.25,27 Herein, we present an analysis of the thermal stabilities and the
energies of unfolding of the wild-type human telomeric sequence 5′-(AGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG)-3′
using circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). Starting with the wild-type sequence,
a series of deoxyoligonucleotides were designed to probe contributions
that the adenines within the loops had on the structural and energetic
contributions (see Table 1 for sequences). The buffer conditions (100 mM NaCl supplemented
buffer) and loop length (three nucleotides) were consistent for CD
and DSC measurements on each of the DNA sequences. In an effort to
discern the number of structurally relevant and or intermediate components
present or arising during the unfolding event, three-dimensional CD
melting curves were generated and analyzed by singular value decomposition
(SVD).

Results and Discussion
CD Studies
on Conformational and Thermal Denaturation
CD spectroscopy
was used to probe the conformational changes that
result from the A to T conversion(s) in the TTA loops of the human
telomeric G-quadruplex sequences. The CD spectra provided in Figure 2 are assembled with
respect to the number of loops modified (i.e., either single loop
change or multiple loop changes). The CD spectrum for the wild-type
sequence (black) is included in both panels for comparison. Structural
analyses by CD of the wild-type human telomeric DNA sequence and concomitant
sequences containing A to T loop modifications reveal that under Na+ conditions, all of the selected sequences used in this study
formed antiparallel G-quadruplex structures, as indicated by their
positive maximum at 295 nm and a negative minimum at 265 nm.30−32 The CD spectra for oligonucleotides with base changes in the TTA
loops (A to T conversions) are all consistent with antiparallel topology;
however, subtle differences are observed in the magnitudes and the
wavelength of the maxima and minima. In the case of single A to T
loop conversion, differences in magnitudes of the maxima at 295 and
245 nm and minimum at 265 nm, relative to the wild-type, are observed.
In the modified sequences with two or more A to T loop conversions,
differences in the magnitudes for all maxima and minima are observed.
Additionally, slightly higher shifts in wavelengths for the maximum
and minimum are observed.

G-quadruplex d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] (red line) and the A to T
converted loop sequences. (A)

Sequences with multiple A to T modified loops.

The CD spectra are clearly influenced by sequence effects,
most
likely because of the geometries associated with differences between
adenine base stacking with G-tetrads that are adjacent to the loops
in the folded structures in the case of the wild-type sequence or
the lack thereof when the adenine is replaced with thymine. CD analyses
of G-quadruplexes are most suited for classifying the strand polarities
(parallel and antiparallel orientations) and observing changes in
the G-quadruplex structure and cannot distinguish between conformations
or structural isoforms of the same strand polarity.33−37 However, when analyzed in conjunction with the DSC
data, we speculate that the changes in the CD spectra are likely due
to the disruption of the stacking interactions resulting from the
removal of the adenine bases from the loop sequences. It has been
previously reported that changing the thymine(s) in the loop sequences
to cytosines results in structural changes to the G-quadruplex formed
when in the presence of potassium.38 The
loss of adenine stacking interactions may result in structural distortion
of the G-tetrads that result in subtle structural changes relative
to the wild-type sequence that would give rise to the observed variations
in the CD spectra.

Chaires and co-workers have provided considerable
insights into
gleaning G-quadruplex unfolding mechanisms by CD spectropolarimetry.26,30,36,37 In this study, CD spectra are used to qualitatively determine the
nature of strand polarity for the folded structures. For these Na+-induced G-quadruplex sequences, all are indicative of antiparallel
conformations.36,37

Melting studies derived
by monitoring the change in CD signal at
295 nm were conducted to probe the effects of A to T loop conversions
on the thermal stabilities for each of the G-quadruplex sequences.29,39−43 Overlays for the single loop and multiple loop modifications are
provided in Figure 3. The curves appear to be monophasic and the Tm was calculated by taking the first derivative of the sigmoidal
melting curve. The wild type G-quadruplex resulted in a melting temperature
of 58 °C. The melting temperatures of the majority G-quadruplexes
harboring one or more A to T loop changes were within ±4 °C
from the wild type. These results are summarized in Table 2. In the case of the 0123TTT
oligonucleotide, where all four adenine residues are replaced with
thymines, a significant reduction in the thermal stability of the
G-quadruplex structure is observed with a Tm of 44 °C, a decrease in thermal stability of 14 °C. In
contrast to this trend, if the sequence of loop 2 was changed from
TTA to TTT, a slight enhancement in the thermal stability (Tm = 62 °C) relative to the wild type was
observed.

sloping characteristics.

b Differential scanning calorimetry
experiments were performed in 10 mM phosphate buffer (BPES) (pH =
7.0), 0.001 M disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), and 0.1
M sodium chloride. For the DSC experiments, the DNA strand concentrations range from 175 to
225 μM. Experiments were conducted with a heating rate of 0.5
°C/min over a range from 10 to 100 °C. A minimum of five
heating and cooling cycles was conducted for each sample to assess
reversibility of the unfolding.

c Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry
melts were performed in 10 mM phosphate buffer (BPES) (pH = 7.0),
0.001 M disodium EDTA, and 0.1 M sodium chloride at a DNA strand concentration
of 3 μM in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The temperature
ranged from 10 to 90 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. Measurements
were taken at every 1 °C after a 1 min equilibration time. A
minimum of three melts were performed per experiment and data averaged.

All of the transitions appeared
to be monophasic and were characterized
by sigmoidal curves. However, a closer examination of the baselines
showed that there were differences for the single-loop and multiple-loop
modified sequences. All of the single- loop modified sequences had
severely sloping pretransition baselines, whereas the multiple-loop
modifications exhibited minimal sloping effects observed for the baselines.
There are a number of potential factors that may cause sloping pretransition
baselines, such as a temperature dependence of the solvent, heat capacity
effects, loss of base stacking interactions, or the presence of intermediates
in the unfolding mechanism. The lack of clearly defined pre- and post-transition
baselines is problematic for calculating thermodynamic parameters
by van’t Hoff analysis and may not represent the true enthalpy
of the unfolding process.44−46

Calorimetric Analysis of
G-Quadruplex Unfolding
Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the heat of unfolding
for each of the G-quadruplex sequences. The advantage of using DSC
is that the measurement is model independent and does not rely on
van’t Hoff plots to determine the enthalpy of the transition
from the folded to unfolded state. A biphasic transition profile was
observed for the wild-type human telomeric sequence in 100 mM NaCl
BPES is shown in Figure 4. Deconvolution of the DSC thermogram required two transitions with
melting Tm’s of 39 and 59 °C
for the first and second transitions, respectively. Similar biphasic
melting profiles have been observed for similar G-quadruplex sequences
in K+ buffer.47−49 These data reveal the transition
to be biphasic with a shoulder occurring prior to the larger transition
that has a Tm of 59 °C. It is necessary
to include two Gaussian curves (red lines) to deconvolute the raw
data (black line) and achieve a suitable fit for the complete transition.
The calorimetric enthalpy was calculated by the integrating the area
under the curve and was determined to be 37.4 kcal/mol for the unfolding
direction. Thermograms for oligonucleotide sequences harboring both
the single loop and multiple loop A to T modifications are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. Melting temperatures and calorimetric enthalpies
are calculated in a manner similar to the wild-type sequence and their
results are reported in Table 2.

(black line) is biphasic with a lower temperature transition at 39
°C and higher temperature transition at 59 °C. The observed
data were fit to two transitions (red lines) and the total area under
the curve integrated to provide the enthalpy of unfolding (ΔHunfold).

(H) A to T modifications of loops 0, 1, and 2 (012TTT); and (I) A
to T modifications of all adenines in the sequence to thymine (0123TTT).

The thermal unfolding of the sequences
with A to T loop modifications
revealed a that the low-temperature transition was reduced in magnitude
for the single A to T loop modifications and was not observed at all
for the multiple A to T loop modifications. The telomeric sequence
where the 5′-A base was converted to 5′-T (0T) most
resembled the wild-type and the additional single loop A to T change
resulted in transition profiles that were broadened with only minor
features present corresponding to the low-temperature transition.
The sequences with multiple A to T loop modifications were all easily
fit with a single transition and lacked any evidence of the low-temperature
transition that was observed for the wild-type and single-loop modifications.
Not only did the presence of the adenine bases contribute to the shape
of the melting transition but also contributed to the calculated unfolding
enthalpies. The unfolding enthalpies for the wild-type sequence and
A to T loop-modified sequences are summarized in Table 2, which reveals that as the
number of adenines modified to thymines are increased, the unfolding
enthalpy decreases. When all of the adenines are converted to thymines
(0123TTT sequence), the enthalpy of the transition was reduced from
37 kcal/mol (as observed for the wild-type sequence) to 22 kcal/mol
for the 0123TTT sequence, a change in unfolding enthalpy of 15 kcal/mol.
Hence, the adenines within the 5′-TTA-3′ loops are demonstrated
to play a significant role in stabilization of the G-quadruplex structure,
presumably through adenine stacking interactions with the adjacent
G-tetrads.50

Comparison of the melting
temperatures derived from the CD data
with the DSC are in good agreement, with the most significant variations
being observed for the single-loop modifications. The variations for
these Tm’s may be due to the pretransition
baselines in the CD data and/or shoulder peaks that are observed for
the DSC data. Analysis of the enthalpy of unfolding comparing the
wild-type with the A to T loop modifications provides a suitable probe
for determining the thermodynamic contributions of the adenine bases
within the TTA loops on G-quadruplex stability. We observed the enthalpy
of unfolding to be systematically reduced as the number of A to T
modifications were increased, indicating the role that adenine stacking
plays on stabilizing the G-tetrads. The energetic contribution toward
stability that is provided by an adenine within the loop was determined
to be approximately 1–2 kcal/mol. For example, the 2TTT sequence
melting temperature was 62 °C and the 0123TTT sequence was destabilized
to 47 °C. The number of transitions that are necessary to fit
the DSC data was reduced to 1 when the sequences with multiple loop
A to T modifications were examined. The DSC data were in good agreement
with the CD data for A to T loop changes that resulted in the highest
and lowest observed thermal stabilities. An outlier was the oligonucleotide
harboring the 2TTT A to T conversion. This sequence exhibited an enhanced
thermal stability of 62 °C. We speculate that replacement of
the A with a T in loop 2 may allow for a more favorable stacking of
the 5′-A with the bottom G-tetrad of the G-quadruplex.

In addition to the adenine-G-tetrad stacking interactions, adenine
in the TTA loops may also contribute both ionic and hydration effects
providing favorable energetic contributions toward G-quadruplex stability;
however, these effects are thought to contribute only modestly to
the unfolding enthalpy.35,45,51 Calculation of the free energy at a reference temperature is a more
useful measure of G-quadruplex stability as compared with melting
temperatures. The calculated free energies at 25 °C for the wild-type
and A to T modified sequences are provided in Table 2. The enhanced thermal stability of the 2TTT
sequence is not as significant when comparing the free energies of
unfolding for the wild-type and modified 2TTT sequences, with both
free energies calculated to be 3.8 kcal/mol. The remaining modified
sequences show a systematic reduction in the free energy with the
fully A to T modified sequence (0123TTT) possessing the lowest calculated
free energy at 25 °C of 1.5 kcal/mol.

Singular Value Decomposition
of G-Quadruplex Unfolding
In an effort to gain insights to
the bimodal transition profile observed
in the DSC thermogram for the wild-type human telomeric sequence,
singular value decomposition (SVD) of three-dimensional CD melting
data are utilized to determine the number of significant spectral
species that are present during the unfolding of the wild-type sequence
and the selected oligonucleotides with single or multiple A to T loop
modifications (Figure 7).35,52 The number of significant spectral species
are estimated by analyzing the different components of the S, U × S, and V matrices, calculating the autocorrelation coefficients
of the U and V matrices, and analyses
of the plots of difference matrices calculated with a succinct number
of singular values. The S matrix is evaluated by
plotting the singular values versus the component number and counting
the number of singular values that rise above the baseline. The U × S matrix is representative of
the basis spectra, and the columns of the U × S matrix are plotted as a function of wavelength. Each trace
in the plot depicts a component involved in the unfolding mechanism,
and those arising above the baseline are considered spectrally significant.
The V matrix columns are plotted as a function of
temperature, and similar to the U × S matrix, each trace represents a different component in
the unfolding process. The components that give distinct traces without
noise are considered spectrally significant. Autocorrelation coefficients
are calculated for each column of both the U and V matrices, and values greater than 0.8 indicate that the
respective component is spectrally significant. A final check to determine
the significance of each spectral component is achieved by calculating
difference matrices and evaluating them through a contour plot. If
the difference plot is calculated with the same number of singular
values as number of spectrally significant components, then the resulting
contour plot will present as random noise.47,52 Difference plots that do not present as random noise are therefore
calculated with the wrong number of singular values.

plot for the thermal denaturation of wild-type
human G-quadruplex. Each line represents a traditional CD scan at
a particular temperature.

For the unfolding of the wild-type telomeric G-quadruplex
sequence
in a Na+ environment, the SVD data reveal a minimum of
three spectral species, as shown in Figure 8. The autocorrelation values for the first
three columns of both the U and V matrices are larger than 0.8, which is also indicative of the presence
of three spectrally significant species. A summary of the singular
values and the U and V matrix autocorrelation
values for the wild-type G-quadruplex sequence is provided in Table 3. The difference matrix
plots for the wild-type sequence calculated with three singular values
resulted in contour plots of random noise, whereas plots created with
one, two, or four singular values yielded contour plots with defined
contour lines (data not shown). Hence, these data are indicative of
a minimum of three spectrally significant species in the unfolding
of the wild-type human telomeric sequence and may account for the
bimodal transition profile observed in the DSC thermogram for the
wild-type human telomeric sequences. A summary of these data for all
of the G-quadruplex A to T loop modified sequences is presented in Table 4. For all sequences
harboring A to T loop modifications, a minimum of three spectrally
significant species were found in all cases with three exceptions;
the 1TTT, 12TTT, and 23TTT sequences were shown to have a minimum
of four spectrally distinct species.

Conclusions
The work described in this manuscript specifically focuses on the
role that the adenine bases within the conserved 5′-TTA-3′-
loops play with respect to the G-quadruplex structural stability.
Using CD spectropolarimetry and calorimetric methods, the adenines
in each of the loop sequences were systematically probed for their
energetic contributions exerted through base stacking and/or hydrogen
bonding within the G-quadruplex structure(s). Considerable work has
been focussed on the effects of altering the base composition and/or
length of the TTA loop sequences with alternate base substitutions,
nonbase linkers, and/or and length on G-quadruplex stabilities.30,47,53−57 Mergny and co-workers examined 27 different G-tract
sequences with differing loop length(s) and sequence(s) and concluded
that all of the sequences examined could form stable G-quadruplex
structures; however, those in potassium were more stable than those
in sodium environments. In cases of single-base loops, pyrimidines
were preferred over adenine. Under sodium conditions, the folding
of the G-quadruplex structures was diverse and sequence dependent,
whereas in potassium, the folding topology was observed to be all
parallel. These studies demonstrated that when guanine was used to
replace adenine in the loops, none of the single base substitutions
hindered the formation of antiparallel quadruplexes in sodium.53−58 However, the effects of such a substitution did differ, depending
on the loop where the substitution occurred. This finding may be a
result of G-slippage in the G-tetrad formation.59 The length of the loops was also varied. Neidle and co-workers
demonstrated that parallel stranded intramolecular quadruplexes are
the only possible fold if the loop is composed of a single residue.
In the case of two or more residues comprising the loop, both parallel
and antiparallel folded structures can form with similar free energies.55 Fox and co-workers demonstrate the bases between
the G-tracts significantly affect quadruplex stability; TTA to AAA
abolishes G-quadruplex formation. Hence, the loop regions of the G-quadruplex
forming sequences are shown to play a critical role in the type of
fold and structural stability of the G-quadruplex. The conservancy
the 5′-TTA-3′ loop sequence for all loops in the human
telomeric DNA and the role that each of the loops exert in the diversity
of structures and stabilities may play a significant role in the biology
of the telomeric region of the chromosome.56,57

The energetic basis for the low-temperature transition observed
for the DSC profiles is complex. One possibility that may explain
the observed biphasic melting profile could be the presence of multiple
conformers and/or intermediate species within the solution that thermally
denature independent of each other. The sodium form of the human telomeric
G-quadruplex has been shown to form both the “chair”
and/or “basket” folding topologies in solution.2,20,24 It is possible that the conversion
of an A to T in one or more of the loop regions may influence the
folding topologies such that the G-quadruplex structure formed will
favor one or the other (basket or chair) conformation. However, if
this were the case, we would not expect the Tm of the low-temperature transition to deviate as much as 15
°C, as observed in the case of the 2TTT loop. The Tm of the low-temperature transitions that are apparent
in the wild-type and single-loop conversions appear to be linked to
the high temperature transition and were never clearly resolved with
a baseline between the transitions. Furthermore, we are not aware
of any published biphasic DSC thermograms of G-quadruplexes that have
been resolved by stabilizing one of the transitions relative to the
other using variations in cation concentration, scan rates, or sequence
variations.26,28,60,61

An additional possibility for the
biphasic profile is the presence
of intermediates in the unfolding pathway. In 2011, Chaires and co-workers
proposed that the human telomeric G-quadruplex does not unfold in
a two-state manner, suggesting that there may be significantly populated
intermediates states.26,37 Our analyses of three-dimensional
CD data by SVD reveal that all A to T loop-altered sequences unfold
along a pathway containing at least three spectral species. Our results
are consistent with previous G-quadruplex folding studies wherein
magnetic tweezers were used to reveal the presence of intermediate
species along the unfolding pathway of the human telomere G-quadruplex
DNA in the presence of Na+.62 SVD analyses of CD data collected as a function of temperature for
the human telomere G-quadruplex in the presence of K+ has
also been previously reported. This study also revealed the presence
of an intermediate species along the unfolding pathway of the G-quadruplex.47

Fluorescence studies have also reported
that both Na+ and K+ forms of the G-quadruplexes
have populated intermediate
states and/or rapid equilibrium between multiple conformers.63,64 Specifically, single molecule FRET studies have been performed on
the human telomeric G-quadruplex in the presence of Na+ that have shown the existence of four populated species during G-quadruplex
folding including an antiparallel basket, and antiparallel chair,
an unfolded single strand, and a transient state that could include
a G-triplex or an (2 + 2) antiparallel structure.65,66 It is safe to assume that the CD techniques used in this study are
not sensitive enough to discern between two G-quadruplex structures
that are energetically similar. In this case, fast conversion between
the antiparallel chair and basket conformations would not be observable
in the SVD analysis of the oligonucleotide sequences harboring the
A to T modified loops and they would appear as one significant spectral
species. Indeed, intermediates encountered by the CD experiments may
be calorimetrically silent; either the intermediate concentrations
are too low to detect or they have enthalpies that are indistinguishable.
We speculate that the biphasic melting profiles of the human telomeric
sequence used for this study are due to the presence of unfolding
intermediates and are characterized by the loss the enthalpic contributions
of the loop base stacking interactions represented by the low-temperature
transition.

The single loop A to T modifications significantly
reduced the
magnitude of the low temperature transition, whereas conversions from
A to T of multiple loop sequences resulted in a complete loss of the
low-temperature transition. Conversion of the 5′-terminal (i.e.,
5′-A) to 5′-T had only a minimal effect on the biphasic
profile and closely resembled the wild-type sequence. The unfolding
of a G-quadruplex structure may involve a process wherein the A bases
within the loop begin to denature prior to the denaturation of the
G-tetrad core. The disruption of adenine–guanine stacking interactions
and/or hydrogen bonding between the bases in the loops would have
enthalpic consequences and could be observed by DSC. It is important
to distinguish that neither the low- or high-temperature transitions
of the denaturing profile represents the intermediate structure. Instead,
the initial unfolding step may involve loop destabilization (low-temperature
transition), followed by the breaking of the G-tetrad core of the
G-quadruplex structure (high-temperature transition). The oligonucleotides
harboring multiple A to T loops modifications have are observed to
have only high-temperature transitions, yet could not be adequately
fit with a simple two-state model. This suggests that these G-quadruplex
structures unfold by a similar mechanism involving initial loop destabilization
followed by the denaturation of the G-tetrad at higher temperatures.
Low-temperature transitions are no longer apparent because the adenine–guanine
base stacks that are responsible for the low-temperature transition
are no longer present in the sequence. The results of this study demonstrate
that the adenines within the G-quadruplex loops play a significant
role in influencing the stability and energetics of the G-quadruplex
structure. Additionally, these results support previously published
work that suggests G-quadruplex thermodynamic stability is a combination
of loop sequence effects and G-tetrad formation.

Experimental Section
Oligonucleotide
Preparation and Nomenclature for A to T Conversion
in G-Quadruplex Sequences
Synthetic oligonucleotides with
the selected adenine to thymine base changes were purchased from Midland
Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). The deoxyoligonucleotides were dissolved
in 100 mM NaCl BPES buffer (0.01 M NaH2PO4,
0.01 M Na2HPO4, and 0.001 M EDTA) and allowed
to equilibrate overnight at 4 °C hironomus prior to their use;
stock solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm Millipore syringe
filters, and the concentrations were determined by UV–visible
spectrophotometry at 90 °C to ensure that any secondary structure
was fully denatured. The molar extinction coefficients were calculated
using the nearest neighbor method, as previously described.67 The DNA solutions were then annealed at a cooling
rate of 0.5 °C/min using a MJ Research Mini-Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Confirmation that each of the DNA sequences was in the G-quadruplex conformation was carried out by circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry,
scanning from 225 to 325 nm and observing the presence of a positive
ellipticity at 295 nm.

Changes to the loop sequences were designed
such that the A residue(s) were sequentially replaced with T residues,
starting at the 5′ end (referred to as loop 0) and at each
of the subsequent loops (loops 1–3). The sequence changes and
nomenclature used to distinguish each of them are illustrated in Table 1.

Circular Dichroism
Spectropolarimetry
Circular dichroism
(CD) melting studies were conducted using an AVIV 400 CD spectropolarimeter
(AVIV Biomedical, Inc., Lakewood, NJ) at a strand concentration of
3 μM in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The deoxyoligonucleotide
solutions were allowed to equilibrate in the cuvette, with stirring
for 15 min prior to each measurement. The thermal difference spectra
revealed the largest change at 295 nm for all sequences, and the CD
signal at 295 nm was monitored as a function of temperature. The temperature
ranged from 10 to 90 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. Measurements
were taken at every 1 °C after a 1 min equilibration time. A
buffer melting baseline was subtracted from each spectrum and data
normalized to molar ellipticity. The melting temperature (Tm) was defined as the midpoint of the transition
calculated by the first derivative of the sigmoidal curve. Model-dependent
van’t Hoff analyses of the melting curves were not performed
due to the presence of sloping pretransition baselines and undetermined
heat capacity changes upon melting of the G-quadruplex structures.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
The heat associated
with the unfolding of the G-quadruplex was measured using a Microcal
VP-DSC (Malvern Instruments, Northampton, MA), at strand concentrations
ranging from 175 to 225 μM. Experiments were conducted with
a heating rate of 0.5 °C/min over a range from 10 to 100 °C.
A minimum of five heating and cooling cycles was conducted for each
sample to assess reversibility of the unfolding. Buffer versus buffer
scans were conducted in an identical manner for the subtraction of
the reference scan.18 DSC data were analyzed
using Origin 7.0 VP-DSC software with the following procedure. The
third buffer/buffer scan was subtracted from the raw data and then
normalized to strand concentration to provide heat capacity versus
temperature plots. These data were corrected for baseline effects
by using the iterative baseline function integrated within the Origin
7.0 VP-DSC software.

The baseline procedure was conducted by
allowing the software to detect the linear portions of the pre- and
post-transitions of the baseline and was only manually adjusted when
there were obvious deficiencies in the selected position. The pre-
and post-transition baselines were connected using the cubic function,
and the resulting baseline was subtracted from the data. The user
has a number of baseline-connecting functions to choose from and can
inadvertently subtract important energetic contributions from the
data. This is particularly true for transitions that exhibit nonzero
changes in heat capacity for the folded and unfolded structures or
sloping baselines. For the studies presented here, the cubic and progress
baseline functions resulted in baselines that had minimal effects
on the transition. However, the progress baseline function was less
effective in providing a reliable baseline for the deoxyoligonucleotides
with single adenine to thymine changes that exhibited pretransition
baseline slopes. Therefore, the cubic baseline function was consistently
used for all of the sequences contained within this study. After baseline
subtraction, the transition was deconvoluted using the minimum number
of Gaussian curves necessary to achieve a good fit.

The total
area under the curve was integrated to provide the enthalpy
of unfolding (ΔHunfold), as defined
by the thermodynamic relationship  The free energy
(ΔG) of unfolding can be calculated from the
Gibb’s free energy
equation  or alternatively at any reference temperature  where ΔCp is the change in heat capacity, T is
the thermodynamic
temperature, and ΔS is the change in entropy.
The midpoint of the transition is defined as the melting temperature
(Tm) and corresponds to a population of
a 50% folded and 50% unfolded G-quadruplex structure.18,28

Singular Value Decomposition Analysis
CD melting data
were collected over a range of wavelengths (320–220 nm) and
used to create a three-dimensional melting profile for analysis by
singular value decomposition (SVD).28 Melting
profiles were collected every 2 °C from 4 to 90 °C with
a temperature slope of 1 °C/min. Three data points were collected
every nanometer from 320 to 220 nm for each degree and averaged. Samples
were allowed to equilibrate for 1 min at each temperature prior to
data collection. The resulting data were arranged in a i × j matrix, with j being
the number of different temperature scans collected over i, number of wavelengths. SVD was performed on each data matrix using
Matlab software (MathWorks, Natick, MA) by applying the following
equation  where A equals the three-dimensional i × j data matrix, U equals the resulting matrix containing the basis spectra, S equals a diagonal matrix containing singular values, and V equals a matrix containing the amplitude vectors. Autocorrelation
of U and V matrices were performed
using the following equation  Difference matrices were calculated
using
the following equation
