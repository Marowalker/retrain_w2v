Prion diseases are
connected with self-replication and self-propagation
of misfolded proteins. The rate-limiting factor is the formation of
the initial seed. We have recently studied the early stages in the
conversion between functional PrPC and the infectious scrapie
PrPSC form, triggered by the binding of RNA. Here, we study
how this process is modulated by the prion sequence. We focus on residues
129 and 178, which are connected to the hereditary neurodegenerative
disease fatal familial insomnia.

Introduction
Prions play a critical
role in the maintenance and growth of neuronal
synapses in mammalian and avian species,1−3 and improperly folded
prions are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases. Examples
are scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cows, chronic
wasting disease in elks and deer; and Creutzfeldt–Jacob, Kuru,
fatal familial insomnia, and potentially even the pregnancy-specific
disorder pre-eclampsia, in humans.3−6 The shared characteristic in all of these
illnesses are cytotoxic aggregates formed from misfolded prions.

However, the underlying disease mechanism is difficult to probe
as, unlike the functional form PrPC, no structural models
of misfolded and toxic PrPSC have been resolved and published
in the protein data bank (PDB). Circular dichroism measurements show
for this so-called scrapie form PrPSC a reduction in helicity
from 43% in PrPC to 30% in PrPSC, coupled with
a rise in β-strand frequency of 3% in PrPC to 43%
in PrPSC.7−14 For the mouse prion, it is known that it is primarily the N-terminal
helix A (residues 143–161) which decays, whereas the central
helix B (172–196) and the C-terminal helix C (200–229)
stay intact or dissolve later.7−14 It is also known that the PrPSC structure is self-propagating,
that is, a prion in this form can convert functional PrPC prions into its toxic PrPSC form. The rate-limiting factor
in this “protein-only” mechanism of transmission15 is the formation of the initial seed. We speculate
that mutations which are known to lead to earlier outbreak, faster
disease progression and more severe symptoms, cause these effects
through enhancing the generation of the initial seeds. If true, it
would therefore be important for evaluating treatment options to understand
the mechanism by which the seeds are generated, and how this mechanism
is altered by mutations.

Various experimental1,16,17 and computational18 studies point to
the possibility that poly-adenosine RNA (poly-A-RNA) catalyzes conversion
of the native PrPC form into PrPSC through interacting
with the N-terminal of the prion. By simulating mouse and human prions,
we have observed that the binding of a poly-A-RNA fragment (shown
in Figure 1) with either
a polybasic domain of residues 21–31, or with a segment made
form residues 144–155, leads to the formation of a characteristic
pincer motif between the polybasic domains of residues 21–31
and on helix A. This pincer encapsulates the RNA fragment, and the
formation of the resulting complex leads to unfolding of helix A as
interactions between the RNA fragment and the side chains of residues
144–148 disrupt locally the backbone hydrogen bonds of helix
A.17,19

Figure 1 Structure of the poly-A-RNA fragment. Note that
all bonds are flexible
during docking, allowing the molecule to bind to the protein surface.

In the present project, we study
whether and how this mechanism
changes when going from wild-type prions to mutants associated with
severe illnesses. Fatal familial insomnia is a neurodegenerative disorder
caused by the loss of neurons in the thalamus20 that starts with a progressively worsening insomnia which rapidly
degenerates into dementia.21 There is currently
no effective treatment, and patients die within 12 months of the first
appearance of symptoms.22 The disease is
associated with a heritable mutation D178N, replacing an acidic aspartic
acid (D) by a neutral asparagine (N), which is known to increase the
polymorphism of the scrapie form.23 The
disease also requires methionine (M) at position 129 and is not observed
with a valine (V) at position 129, another often found variant of
the wild type.24 In our previous investigation,18 we considered only the predominant 129M variant
of the wild type. Here, we extend these investigations and research
on how the residue replacements D178N and M129V alter the interactions
between poly-A-RNA and prions and the mechanism that leads to unfolding
of helix A. Four systems will be studied: the wild type with 129M
and 178D (129M-178D), its variant with 129V (129V-178D), and the two
mutants 129M-178N and 129V-178N. The sequence of these four systems
is listed in Figure 2. By analyzing long-time molecular dynamics simulations of these
four systems, we argue that residue 129 controls the probability of
RNA binding to a site that allows for the pincer conversion mechanism
proposed by us in earlier work,18 whereas
the mutation D178N increases the stability and extension of the pincer.

Results and Discussion
In ref (17), we
have identified three sites where the poly-A-RNA can bind to the PrPC form of the wild-type 129M-178D. At binding site 1, the RNA
interacts with residues 21–31, at binding site 2 with residues
111–121; and binding site 3 consists of residues 144–155.
In the 11 stable complexes predicted by Autodock, binding site 1 was
observed 5 times, site 2 was observed 4 times, and site 3 was observed
3 times. Only when the RNA binds to site 1 and site 3 did we see in
molecular dynamic simulations the formation of a pincer motif followed
by decay of the N-terminal helix A, the first step in the conversion
to the scrapie form PrPSC. On the other hand, binding to
site 2 did not alter the stability of helix A or any other helix.

The residue replacements M129V and/or D178N shift the probabilities
of the binding sites but we do not find new binding sites in the three
prions 129V-178D, 129M-178N, and 129V-178N (sequences shown in Figure 2) now considered.
For the 129M-178N mutant, binding site 3 is observed in all of the
top 10 complexes predicted by Autodock. Furthermore, the estimated
binding affinity is with −9.3(0.5) kcal/mol, substantially
lower than the corresponding binding energies of −6.8 (1.1)
kcal/mol for site 3 in the 129M-178D wild type. For the 129V-178D
sequential variation of the wild type, 8 of the top 10 complexes bind
at site 2, with the remaining two complexes binding to site 1. The
higher frequency with which this binding site is found corresponds
again to a lower average binding energy of −8.4 (0.7) kcal
mol (compared to −6.5(0.8) kcal/mol for the 129M-178D wild
type) calculated by Autodoc. Little changes are seen for binding site
1: −6.6 (0.7) kcal/mol in 129M-178D compared to −6.3
(1.0) kcal/mol in 129V-178D. For the last prion, the mutant 129V-178N,
we again observe all three of our previously identified binding sites:
site 3 is found 6 times, site 1 is found 3 times, and site 2 is seen
once. Site 3 is the only one that shows an increased affinity, although
less discernible than previous mutations, with −6.8 (1.1) kcal/mol
in 129M-178D rising to −7.9 (0.7) kcal/mol in 129V-178N. As
in our previous study of the 129M-178D wild type, we selected for
all of the three new systems (129V-178D, 129M-178N, and 129V-178N)
the most probable conformation (see methods section for further explanation)
of a complex with a certain binding site and followed its time evolution
over 300 ns in three independent trajectories. A matrix of the various
systems, binding sites, and trajectory numbers is given in Table 1.

Visual Inspection and Trajectory Analysis
Fatal familial
insomnia is connected with a methionine at residue 129 (129M) and
the mutation D178N. Poly-A-RNA binding to this mutant (our system
129M-178N) is only observed at binding site 3, residues 144–155.
In the wild type (129M-178D) studied in our previous work, binding
of RNA to site 3 always lead to the unfolding of helix A. The same
is observed here for the mutant; however, we find two differences.
First, in about 60% of all configurations sampled in our molecular
dynamics trajectories, residue 178N forms a hydrogen bond with 18D
that restrains the movement of helix C and keeps it in close proximity
to both helix A and the polybasic domain of residues 21–31,
see Figure 3A. This,
second, allows for the RNA to interact with both helix A (140–158)
and helix C (200–220), see Table 2. As a consequence, not only helix A but
also most of helix C has dissolved in the final configuration of the
300 ns trajectory. Note that helix C is now also participating in
the three-pronged helix-polybasic pincer motif, adding to the polybasic
domain of residues 21–31 and the segment of residues 140–161
on helix A additional contacts between the RNA and residues 219–223
on helix C (see Table 2). However, while all trajectories led to unfolding of helix A, this
enlarged pincer and the decay of helix C is only seen in two of the
three trajectories.

three prion
models. The 129M-178N mutant binds only to site 3 shown in (A), whereas
the 129V-178N binds to site 1 (B), site 2 (C), or site 3 (D). The
129V-178D wild-type variant binds to either site 2 (E) or site 1 (F).

a Data are for complexes where the
RNA fragment binds to either site 1 or site 3, leading to unfolding
of helices.

The above picture
is quantified in Figure 4B, where we show the time evolution of the
RMSD with respect to the start configuration. We compare the complex
of poly-A-RMA binding to the prion with that of the isolated prion
having the same structure. For comparison, we show in Figure 4A the same quantity as calculated
from our previous studies of the wild-type 129M-178D in ref (17). In all systems, we distinguish
between complexes where the RNA docks to binding site 1 or 3 (shown
in red), and where it docks to binding site 2 (shown in gold). The
blue circle indicates the region of the trajectory after which less
than 50% of the helical contacts of helix A remain. These are also
the regions where we observe large changes in RMSD. This transition
region appears much earlier in the trajectory for the mutant system.
Note also the second jump in RMSD marked by the black circle where
50% of helical contacts for helix C have decayed. The decrease in
helicity is also seen in Table 3. Although the helicity does not change in the control, the
average helicity decreases from about 43 to 32% for the wild type
when RNA binds to either site 1 or 3. In the 129M-178N mutant, the
overall helicity decreases from 45 to 30%, most of it coming from
helix A (95 to 20%), with the reduction for helix C from 96 to 38%.

each. RMSD values for isolated prions are drawn in green that for

where the

Fatal familial insomnia is not observed
in humans carrying the
D178N mutation if residue 129 is a valine instead of a methionine
(more commonly observed at this position). Taking the 129M-178N mutant
and substituting a valine at position 129, the 129V-178N mutant leads
to poly-A-RNA binding to all three binding sites that are also observed
in our previous simulations18 of the wild-type
129M-178D. Complexes with these three binding sites are shown in Figure 3B–D. Similar
to the behavior of the 129M-178D wild type, unraveling of helices
for the mutant 129V-178N is observed only for binding at sites 1 or
3, not when the poly-A-RNA fragment binds to site 2. However, Table 2 also shows that if
the pincer motif is formed, it is three-pronged as observed in the
129M-178N mutant and involves helix A, helix C, and the polybasic
domain of residues 21–31. This motif is observed in two of
the three trajectories for both binding site 1 and binding site 3.

The above observations are again quantified by the RMSD plots in Figure 4C. Initially, the
docked system resembles the 129M-178D wild type (Figure 4A), with similar regions for
the decays of helix A (indicated by blue circles). At 240 ns, we also
see a jump in RMSD corresponding to the unraveling of helix C indicated
by a black circle, however, the signal is less pronounced than for
the 129M-178N mutant. Correspondingly, the decline in helicity in Table 3 is less than that
for the 129M-178N mutant, decreasing from 97 to 25% in helix A and
97 to 48% in helix C. Hence, comparing the two mutants 129M-178N and
129V-178N, it appears that the mutation D178N extends the unraveling
of helices from helix A to helix C. On the other hand, a valine instead
of a methionine as residue 129 seems to increase the frequency of
binding to site 2 which does not lead to unraveling of helices in
the prion protein.

In the wild type, we observe transient β-strands
in the region
of helix A that hint at the start of the conversion to the PrPSC state, as shown by the increase in relative β-strand
content and occupancy in Table 3. Here, occupancy is defined as the average amount of time
a β-strand is observed. Although the total β-strand propensity
increases only by about 5%, the average life time of the transient
β-strands grows by about 25%, which may indicate that the conversion
to the β-sheet-rich PrPSC structure is to begin.
Such transient β-strands are also observed in both D178N mutants,
with similar values for β-strand content and occupancy. However,
even with the more rapid and extensive helical unfolding seen in the
D178N mutants, 300 ns is clearly too short for the formation of stable
β-sheets expected in the PrPSC.

From our comparison
of the two mutants 129M-178N and 129V-178N,
we would expect to see for the wild type with valine at position 129
(129V-178D) that the frequency of complexes with poly-A-RNA binding
to site 2 is larger than that seen for the 129M-178D wild type. We
find indeed that for 129V-178D in 80% of the complexes, poly-A-RNA
binds to site 2 (Figure 3E), whereas the corresponding number in our previous simulations
of 129M-178D is only 40%.18 As observed
in all our simulations, binding to site 2 does not lead to unfolding
of helices. Only in 20% of cases did we find binding to site 1 (Figure 3F), and in no case
binding to site 3. On the other hand, binding sites 1 and 3 are observed
with a frequency of 80% in the 129M-178D wild type. While complexes
with binding site 1 are observed with a lower frequency for the 129V-178D
wild type than for the 129M-178D wild type, they lead again to the
decay of helix A. However, the interaction is weaker with only a partial
unraveling of helix A that starts late after ∼150 ns and is
not preceded by the formation of the pincer motif. This can be seen
from the RMSD plot in Figure 4D where we do not see a discernible loss in helical contacts
until the last 50 ns of the trajectory. In addition, there is a little difference
between the RMSD values for binding site 1 (shown in red), binding
site 2 (shown in gold), and the undocked system (shown in blue). Hence,
it seems that valine instead of methionine at position 129 decreases
not only the probability to bind to site 1 or site 3, but also in
the rare cases where binding to these sites is seen and hinders or
delays the formation of the pincer by increasing the flexibility in
critical regions of the N-terminal domain.

Hydrogen Bond Pattern and
Structural Flexibility
To
understand how the variation in sequence at position 129 and 178 changes
the effect of poly-A-RNA binding to prions, we focus on trajectories
where the RNA fragment binds to either site 1 or 3. This is because
binding to site 2 never lead to unraveling of helices in the prion
protein which we assume to be the initial state in the conversion
from PrPC to the scrapie form PrPSC. We start
by looking in Figure 5 into the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of each residue in
various systems. The presented data are for complexes where the RNA
fragment binds to the prion at either site 1 or 3 and are divided
by the corresponding values for the unbound prion. Thus, values greater
than one indicate that the prion has grown more flexible upon binding
with RNA. As reference, we show in Figure 5A our results for the wild type 129M-178D
from our previous study in ref (17). Note the characteristic spikes around the segment that
forms helix A (residues 140–161) in the prion, indicating the
unraveling of this helix upon binding of poly-A-RNA at site 1 or 3.
This is confirmed by Table S1 where the
average probability of finding a 1–4 backbone hydrogen bonds
in helix A is listed for a given time period. For comparison, we also
show the corresponding frequencies for the undocked protein. Upon
binding of the RNA fragment to either site 1 or 3, helix A loses contacts
between residues 144–148 in the initial 100 ns of the trajectory.
As the simulations evolve, E146, Y49, Y150, and N153 lose their helical
contacts as they begin to interact with the RNA. The time evolution
of backbone–backbone contacts in this and the other three systems
can also be seen from the contact maps shown in Figures S1–S3.

Figure 5 RMSF of residues. Shown is the ratio of RMSF
values calculated
for residues in prions where an RNA fragment binds to either site
1 or site 2 (leading to unfolding of helices), divided by the corresponding
values for the undocked prions. A ratio of 1 (marked by a green line)
means that a given residue is equally flexible in the bound system
and in the isolated prion. Values above the green line indicate elevated
flexibility upon interaction with RNA.

The spike in RMSF is larger in the mutant 129M-178N than
in the
wild type and leads to a similar reduction of 1–4 hydrogen
bonds in helix A (Table S1). However, a
second spike in RMSD is observed at residues 200–220, signaling
the decreased stability of helix C, see Figure 5B and Table S2. The higher flexibility in these two regions is, as seen in the
wild type, associated with a drop in flexibility for the N-terminal
residues 20–45 upon the formation of the helical-polybasic
pincer motif.

As expected, a similar but less pronounced behavior
is also observed
in the 129V-178N mutant (Figure 5C), with the unraveling of helix C delayed (Table S2). Note especially that the binding of
poly-A-RNA to the two mutants does not increase the flexibility of
residues 45–90 as it does for the wild-type 129M-178D. The
increased flexibility of these residues in the later system results
from a loss of contacts between helix A and polar residues of the
N-terminal domain upon interaction with the RNA fragment. In the wild
type, the frequency of these contacts drops from 32% (7%) for the
isolated prion to 12% (3%) when in complex with RNA. However, in the
two mutants, there is the possibility for a contact between residue
178N and 18D that stabilizes the segment. As a consequence, the frequency
of contacts upon binding of RNA does not drop in the 129M-178N mutant,
36% (5%) versus 39% (4%). Hence, on effect of the D178N, mutation
seems to be the stabilization of the N-terminal segment of residues
45–90, which makes it easier to form the pincer that is associated
with unraveling of the helices in the prion. This effect is weaker
in the 129V-178N mutant, where the frequency of stabilizing contacts
still drops from 39% (6%) to 22% (4%).

On the other hand, the
drop in frequency of these contacts in the
129V-178D variant of the wild type is similar to that in the 129M-178N
form: 31% (4%) down to 11% (6%), however, the relative fluctuations
in the N-terminal region are larger than that in the 129M-178D wild
type, see Figure 5D.
Hence, a valine instead of a methionine at position 129 may not only
shift the binding pattern to site 2 but also increase the flexibility
of the N-terminus. Because for 129V-178D, the RNA fragment binds only
to site 1 (residues 21–31) or 2 (residues 111–121),
the higher flexibility of this region may explain the difficulties
seen in forming a stable pincer motif and the late unraveling of helix
A seen for this variant of the wild type.

Table 4 shows that
despite the loss of the backbone hydrogen bonds in helix, the newly
formed contacts of residues with the poly-A-RNA result in an overall
higher number of hydrogen bonds. For the fatal familial insomnia causing
sequence 129M-178N, 14 hydrogen bonds are gained despite the dissolution
of helix A and C, possibly indicating the start of forming another
ordered structure. For the wild type and the nondisease-causing mutant
129V-178N, the gain is still 12 hydrogen bonds. Hence, for the two
mutants and the 129M wild type, despite the loss of helix-stabilizing
hydrogen bonds, the binding of RNA appears energetically favorable.
This is different for the 129V variant of the wild type where because
of the increased flexibility of the N-terminus, about five hydrogen
bonds are lost.

Conclusions
We
have extended a previous investigation18 of the effect of poly-A-RNA on the conversion of functional PrPC into the toxic and self-propagating scrapie form PrPSC, by exploring how this process depends on the prion sequence.
Our guiding assumption is that mutants which are associated with fast
disease progression and sever symptoms ease the process of seed generation.
The example we chose is the D178N mutant which, when going together
with a methionine as residue 129, 129M-178N, leads to fatal familial
insomnia, but not if residue 129 is a valine (129V-178N). As controls,
we also looked into the case of the wild-type variant 129V-178D (instead
of the 129M-178D version studied by us in previous work18) which has a valine as residue 129 and is known
to be associated with a lower frequency of neurodegenerative disorders.
In a meta-analysis of Creutzfeldt–Jakob patients, only 10%
were found to be homozygous for valine at the 129 position, with ∼50%
being homozygous for methionine at the 129 position and the remaining
being heterozygous.25

In all cases,
we observe that unraveling of helix A is connected
with the appearance of a pincerlike motif between helix A and the
polybasic domain that encapsulates the RNA. Formation of the pincer
requires binding of the RNA to either the polybasic segment of residues
21–31 (binding site 1) or the segment 141–155 (binding
site 3) and traps the RNA. In both D178N mutants, this pincer becomes
three-pronged and leads also to the unraveling of helix C. As the
molecular dynamic trajectories proceed, formation of the pincer is
followed by replacement of helical contacts in helix A (and helix
C in the mutants) by short and transient β-strands that eventually
may lead to the high β-sheet propensity of the disease-causing
misfolded PrPSC structure. Hence, RNA binding to the prion
can trigger the conversion of the cellular prion protein structure
PrPC to its infectious scrapie PrPSC form, a
process whose early steps (formation of the pincer motif starting
unfolding of helix A and in the mutants helix C) could be observed
in our 300 ns long molecular dynamics trajectories.

The sequence
variation at positions 129 and 178 of the prion protein
modulates this process in two ways. First, they alter the probability
that RNA binds to the prion protein at a site that allows the formation
of the pincer motif, and second, they change the stability and extension
of this motif. The gatekeeper for the first effect appears to be residue
129, with a valine at this position skewing the binding of RNA to
site 2, which does not lead to unraveling of helices, and further
increasing the flexibility of the N-terminus. On the other hand, a
methionine at this position increases the chances of binding to site
1 or site 3, resulting in the formation of the pincer and subsequent
unfolding of helix A. The second effect is controlled by residue 178.
This mutation decreases the frequency of the side chain contact between
178D-101K, which in turn increases the flexibility in residues 90–105
around binding site 2. Hence, the probability to bind to site 2 while
at the same time binding to site 3 will be enhanced. An even more
important effect of the mutation D178N is the formation of a stable
contact between residues 178N and 18D that restricts the motion of
the polybasic domain of residues 21–31, enhancing the appearance
of the pincer motif. Furthermore, the 178N-18D contact brings the
RNA into close proximity with the C-terminal region of helix C, allowing
for the formation of a three-pronged pincer between the polybasic
domain and the two helices. This leads to the eventual decay of helical
contacts in both helix A and C. We caution that this relation between
rigidity of the N-terminal region (residues 21–31) and enhanced
prion fibril formation is not general. Protein-docking studies by
Schillinger et al. suggest that the increased flexibility enhances
the rate of assembly for the human interleukin-6 receptor complex.26 Conversely, Kouza et al. saw a decline in the
rate of aggregation of amyloidogenic monomers with increased flexibility
of the peptide.27 It is likely specific
to our system that the increased rigidity of this key reason is connected
with enhanced unfolding and (presumed) subsequent aggregation. The
net effect of the residue combination 129M and 178N is that it both
increases the frequency of binding of RNA to sites that allow for
the formation of the pincer motif and the strength and extension of
this motif. The net effect is a faster conversion of the functional
PrPC prion structure to an infectious scrapie PrPSC form that may seed the formation of toxic amyloids which then cause
the symptoms of familial fatal insomnia.

Materials and Methods
Model
Generation
In human systems, prion proteins attach
to the cell membrane of neurons in the extracellular space via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI) anchor which is added to the C-terminus following a prior cleavage
of 24 residues from the C-terminal residues.2,3 As
our previous study showed that an unanchored system is sufficient
to model the initial stages of conversion,18 we save on the computational costs by modeling all our systems in
this study with unanchored prions. To exclude erroneous charge interactions
in the C-terminal region, we simulate the full-sized, noncleaved prions
with all 253 residues. As only the C-terminal region of the native
protein structure has been fully resolved, we have used in our previous
work18 the two programs MODELLER and ITASS
for prediction of the un-resolved N-terminal segment of residues 1–121.28−32 Both methods led to similar models with marginal differences in
binding sites and strength. As the ITASS structure preserved slightly
the C-terminal helices, we used this protein structure as the starting
point for our study. Using ITASS to refine our model to our previously
determined template, we took this wild-type PrpC structure
and mutated residues 178D and/or 129M into 178N and/or 129 V. This
led to three structures, corresponding to 129M and 178N, 129V and
178D, 129V and 178N, which were relaxed in short (5 ns) molecular
dynamics simulations at 310 K and 1 bar. Configurations were taken
from these trajectories at 500 ps intervals (0.5 ns) and assessed
using three separate methods for quantifying the model quality: Rampage,33 ERRAT,34 and ProQ.35 For this purpose, we calculate the average score
for the corresponding trajectory. If this score is below the cutoff
value for any of the three methods, the initial structure is refined
using a combination of MODELLER and ITASS, as outlined in ref (36) until the resulting trajectory
passes the quality threshold. The so-generated three structures were
selected for the next stage of model generation.

Docking Confirmation
As in our previous work,18 we selected
Autodock 25 to generate our protein-RNA
complexes, a program that has a successful history of modeling similar
systems.37,38 A 5-nucleotide snippet of poly-A-RNA was
selected as this is the minimal size that let in experiments to consistent
prion conversion whereas photodegradation below the five nucleotide
threshold drastically lowered the rate of conversion.39,40 Our docking protocol allows for free rotation around all single
bonds in the RNA molecule. The 10 highest scoring docked systems for
all three target structures were collected for the next stage of model
generation. These complexes were examined for common regions of protein–RNA
interaction and compared to the ones seen in our previous study. The
D178N mutation 129M-178N is the most probable binding site for all
10 complexes, the one that we called binding site 3 (residues 135–145)
in our previous study. The M129V sequence change (129V-178D) results
in eight complexes with binding site 2 (residues 111–121) and
two complexes with binding site 1 (residues 21–31). The third
system, characterized by residue changes M129V and D178N (129V-178N),
has again only binding sites also seen in our previous study: six
complexes with binding site 1, one complex with binding site 2, and
three complexes with binding site 3. We then evaluated the stability
of all 30 complexes in short (10 ns) long molecular dynamics simulations
with a temperature of 310K and pressure of 1 bar, looking for RNA
detachment from the protein. No such detachment was seen for the D178N
mutant 129M-178N. For the 129V-178D system, the RNA did detach for
two of the eight complexes with binding site 2. For the system with
both residue alterations M129V and D178N (129V-178N), the RNA detached
from the Prion was not only in the sole complex with binding site
2 but also in one of the six complexes with binding site 1. Note that
in our previous study of prion RNA interaction,18 we encountered similar events of RNA detachment, all involving
binding site 2. In the present study for long molecular dynamics runs,
we considered only complexes where we did not observe RNA detachment
in the short runs. Out of the remaining cluster, we selected a start
configuration for the long runs for each system and each observed
binding site, the one that had the lowest RMSD in the helix A region
at the end of the above-described short runs. In this way, we tried
to minimize any possible bias in our complexes toward helix instability. Table 1 presents a matrix
of systems and binding sites with the number of structures and long
molecular dynamics runs for each case. As a control, we also evaluate
the stability of the isolated prions, by following molecular dynamics
trajectories of the same length and generated with the same simulation
protocol, with the prion having the same start configuration as in
the corresponding complex.

Simulation Protocol
All our molecular
dynamics simulations
rely on the GROMACS software package version 4.6.5,41 using the CHARMM36 force field with associated nucleic
acid parameters42−45 and TIP3P water model46,47 to model interactions
between protein, RNA, and water. The prion was put at the center cubic
box with at least 12 Å distance between the boundary of the box
and the protein-RNA complex, and the box was filled with water molecules.
Periodic boundary conditions are used, and the electrostatic interactions
are calculated via the PME algorithm.48,49 Because of
the size of the system and the potential for steric clashes during
solvation, the solvated model was relaxed first by steepest descent
energy minimization following a 2 ns molecular dynamic simulation
using NVT protocol and a subsequent 2 ns simulation using NPT protocol.

For integration of the equations of motion, a 2 fs time step is
used, with hydrogen atoms constrained by the LINC algorithm50 and water constrained with the Settle algorithm.51 The temperature of the system is kept at 310
K by the Parrinello–Donadio–Bussi thermostat51,52 (τ = 0.1 fs) and the pressure at 1 bar by Parrinello–Rahman
algorithm (τ = 1 fs).53 A group cutoff
scheme was selected, with a neighbor search using a grid-cutoff scheme
with a cutoff distance of 1.5 nm. Electrostatic interactions outside
these dimensions are handled by particle mesh Ewald with cubic interpolation
and grid dimensions set to 0.15 nm.

For each of the systems
listed in Table 1,
we run three molecular dynamic trajectories
differing in the initial velocity distributions to get a simple estimate
of the statistical fluctuations between trajectories. Data are saved
every 4 ps for further analysis. Using the internal tools of GROMACS,
we measured RMSDs of the Cα atoms, secondary structure contents,
contact distances, and hydrogen bonding. Configurations are visualized
using PyMOL54 and VMD.
