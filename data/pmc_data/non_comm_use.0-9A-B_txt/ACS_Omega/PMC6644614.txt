A reproducible and environmentally
friendly method for the preparation
of high molecular-weight stereocomplex polylactide (HMW SCPLA) is
achieved. Poly(l-lactide) and poly(d-lactide) were
simply dissolved in an environmentally friendly solvent, dibasic ester
(DBE), at 110 °C. Then, the two solutions were mixed and cooled
to room temperature, and the HMW SCPLA spontaneously precipitated
in the form of fine powder consequently. The presence of the DBE reduced
the reaction temperature and improved the molecular mobility of the
polymers; thus, the degradation problems and the molecular diffusion
issue in the process of the formation of the stereocomplex could be
overcome. The relationship among the concentration of the mixture,
degree of stereo-complexation, and thermal properties of SCPLA powders
was also established. Moreover, porous membrane and film SCPLA material
with good thermal properties were also obtained using this thermally
induced technique. This method could be a good approach to expand
the SCPLA applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polylactides [poly l-lactide (PLLA) and poly d-lactide (PDLA)] are biodegradable,
compostable, and producible from
renewable resources. They have been widely used in medical applications
because of their excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability.1 However, the widespread application of homopolylactide
(HCPLA) has been limited by its poor thermal stability and hydrolysis
resistance.2 Stereocomplex polylactide
(SCPLA) has been proven to be possess more excellent properties than
HCPLA.3 The stereocomplex has a melting
temperature (Tm) of approximately 50 °C
higher than the Tm of HCPLA.4

Many strategies, such as crystallization
of block copolymers,5 casting of films
from concentrated solutions,6,7 melt blending processes,8,9 supercritical fluid
technology,10 layer-by-layer deposition,11,12 electrospinning,13 gelation in an ionic
liquid,14 and spray-drying technology15 have been developed to prepare SCPLA. Collectively,
these methods have produced SCPLA successfully. However, generally,
while these methods provide some advantages such as scalability and
high degree of SCPLA formation, they still suffer from drawbacks including
high cost, low throughput, significant degradation, and time consuming.
Therefore, a simple, scalable, inexpensive, and high-throughput method
of fabricating SCPLA remains a challenge. Furthermore, similar to
cellulose,16 searching for systems with
an environmentally friendly process is very important for advancement
of the SCPLA industries.

In this paper, we reported the preparation
of complete high molecular-weight
(HMW) SCPLA using the thermally induced technology with dibasic ester
(DBE) as medium. DBE is known as a low-risk green solvent that is
derived from biomass which is biodegradable.17,18 DBE solution provides an environment beneficial to the formation
of stereocomplex crystals. On the basis of previous studies, the thermally
induced technique is reported to be an easy scalable method, which
separates the mixture solution into two phases (polymer-rich/polymer-lean
phase) either by exposing the solution to an immiscible solvent or
by cooling the solution below its solubility temperature.19−21 This whole system reduced the temperature of preparation of SCPLA,
which effectively inhibited the PLA degradation and reduced the energy
consumption. Moreover, this method of solution crystallization was
more conducive to the formation of fully HMW SCPLA. The difficulties
in low-chain diffusion ability and restricted intermolecular crystal
growth of HMW PLA, which have profound influence in the degree of
stereocomplexation, could be overcame.22 By using the thermally induced phase separation technique in DBE
solution, this fabrication approach might be sustainable, reproducible,
scalable, and economical to prepare SCPLA materials.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Reagents
DBE and Sn(Oct)2 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
DBE was distilled over
CaH2 before use. Lactide (d- and l-)
with an optical purity of 98% was supplied by Musashino Chemical (China)
Co., Ltd.

2.2 Fabrication of SCPLA Powder, Porous Membrane,
and Film
PLLA and PDLA were synthesized by ring-opening polymerization
according to the literature.23 The following
were the specific steps: lactide (d- and l-) was
reacted in the ampoule bottle in 137 °C under 50 Pa after being
dried in vacuum for 24 h at room temperature, and 0.05 wt % Sn(Oct)2 was added as the catalyst. The resulting polymers were purified
by reprecipitation using dichloromethane as the solvent and methanol
as the precipitant. The purified products were dried to constant mass
in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.

The fabrication of SCPLA via
a thermally induced process was carried out as illustrated in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Preparation Process
of the SCPLA
PLLA (Mn = 111.5 kg/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.4) and PDLA (Mn = 100.4 kg/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.3) were dissolved separately
in DBE solutions and then mixed together with a 1:1 ratio by weight
at the same temperature (110 °C). HMW PLLA and PDLA are almost
insoluble in DBE at room temperature but could be totally dissolved
in DBE equal to or higher than 110 °C. In terms of reducing energy
consumption, the polylactide dissolve experiment was carried out at
110 °C. The solutions were mixed under the concentration of 25,
50, and 100 mg/mL accordingly which are successively named as SC25,
SC50, and SC100, respectively. After stirring for ca. 15 min, glass
bottles containing the mixed solutions were cooled down to room temperature
at the rate of ca. 10 °C/min. When the temperature dropped to
ca. 95 °C, the solution became turbid and the precipitates could
be observed. The picture of the cooling process is shown in Figure 1. The solution was
left statically for 1 h, and after that the formed precipitates were
separated from the suspensions by centrifugation and washed twice
with ethanol at room temperature to remove the residual DBE. The obtained
white powder was dried in vacuum at 40 °C for ca. 24 h.

Figure 1 Precipitates
observed in different temperatures.

The porous membrane of SCPLA was prepared using the following
procedures:
the solution of SC50 was cast on a clean tinfoil substrate under 110
°C. After the solvents were evaporated completely, the microporous
film was formed.

The films of PLLA, PDLA, and SCPLA are prepared
in the compression
moulding machine (Carver, Wabash, IN). The powder was spread on the
aluminum foils and placed in the compression mold at a pressure of
approximately 15 MPa and a set temperature of 190 °C for 5 min.

2.3 Characterization
The molecular weight
and polymer dispersity index of PLLA, PDLA, and SCPLA were determined
using gel permeation chromatography (GPC; Malvern Viscotek 270 max
UK). Hexafluoroisopropanol was used as the mobile phase and the polystyrene
was used as the standard.

Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was carried out with Netzsch DSC 204 F1 Germany. Specimens (powders
and films) weighing around 5 mg were heated at the rate of 10 °C/min
and cooled at the rate of 10 °C/min. All tests were under the
nitrogen atmosphere.

The wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD)
analyses were performed
on Rigaku D/max-2550 PC (Japan). Cu Kα radiation with wavelength
λ = 0.1542 nm was used.

The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of PLLA, PDLA, and
SCPLA were obtained by the attenuated total reflection method using
a PerkinElmer Spectrum II FTIR spectrometer.

Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with Hitachi
S-4800 equipped with an SE detector at HV = 5 kV.

The mechanical
properties of PLLA, PDLA, and SCPLA films were measured
on a Universal Material Tester (H5 K-S, Hounsfield, UK) operating
with an extension rate of 50 mm/min according to ASTM D5034. The reported
Young’s modulus, tensile strength at yield, and elongation
at break were evaluated from five repeats for each sample.

3 Results and Discussion
FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful
tool for distinguishing a stereocomplex
from a homocrystal. The CH3···O=C
intermolecular interaction is revealed as the driving force for SCPLA
formation.24 The band of ν(C=O)
migrated from 1751 cm–1 for HCPLA to 1746 cm–1 for SCPLA (Figure 2A). The absorbance peaks of 921 and 908 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks of HCPLA and SCPLA, respectively.25 As shown in Figure 2B, the FTIR absorption of SC crystallites
(908 cm–1) became prominent for SC100, and the band
of HCPLA crystallites (921 cm–1) vanished completely
for SC50 and SC25.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra of PLLA, PDLA, SC25, SC50, and SC100 [(A)
absorption
peak of C=O, (B) absorption peak of SC crystallites].

The relative molecular weights
of PLA are usually reduced during
the hot procedure at elevated temperature. The molecular weights of
the SCPLA, PLLA, and PDLA were determined after stereocomplexation
by a GPC light scattering detector. The results are shown in Figure 3. The molecular weights
of the SCPLA and PLLA/PDLA were almost the same, indicating no significant
polymer degradation during the preparation process.

Figure 3 GPC curves and molecular
characteristic of PLLA, PDLA, SC25, SC50,
and SC100.

To investigate the formation of
the stereocomplex of PLA in the
DBE, DSC measurements were also conducted. Figure 4 shows the DSC heating traces of PLLA, PDLA,
SC25, SC50, and SC100. Obviously, SCPLA crystallites generated in
the precipitates from all the solutions studied here. Either the pure
PDLA or PLLA gave a peak at 178 °C, which corresponded to the
melting point of the homocrystal of PLLA and PDLA. For the SC25, SC50,
and SC100, the melting points were around 228 °C, whereas the
endothermic peaks related to the homocrystal were not observed, indicating
that stereocomplex crystallites existed solely. These observations
coincided well with the FTIR results. The enthalpies of SCPLA were
estimated by DSC, and the values were 88.0, 82.9, and 70.3 J/g for
SC25, SC50, and SC100, respectively. Crystallinities (Xc) of SCPLA crystallites were estimated by normalizing
their enthalpy to the equilibrium enthalpy of perfect crystals, taken
as 142 J/g for SCPLA crystallites.26 Consequently,
the Xc were 62, 58, and 50% for SC25,
SC50, and SC100, respectively. It was noticeable that Xc became smaller as the polymer concentration increased,
which might be attributed to the more difficult molecular chain movement
with the higher concentration. The presence of DBE could improve the
molecular chain mobility and mutual diffusion of PLLA and PDLA, leading
to reduction of the kinetic barrier for stereocomplex formation to
a certain extent.

Figure 4 DSC thermograms of the first heating scan of PLLA, PDLA,
SC25,
SC50, and SC100.

To further confirm the
formation of the stereocomplex in the DBE,
WXRD measurements were conducted. As shown in Figure 5, the neat PLLA and PDLA have characteristic
diffractions at 2θ of about 14.5°, 16.8°, 19.1°,
and 22.5°, which is in agreement with the peaks reported at 15°,
16°, 18.5°, and 22.5° by Ikada and co-workers.4 Meanwhile, the SCPLA has the diffraction peaks
appearing at 2θ of around 11.8°, 20.5°, and 23.9°,
which is in agreement with the peaks reported at 12°, 21°,
and 24° by Ikada and co-workers.4 However,
for SC100, a very small diffraction peak at 2θ of about 16.8°
can be observed, which might be a symbol of residual homo-PLA crystallites.
When the concentration reached 100 mg/mL, chains should be intensively
entangled and their mobility might be constrained relatively, leading
to the more difficult formation of SCPLA. In combination with SC50
and SC25, this result further confirmed that the higher the concentration,
the lower mobility of the molecular chain, which is consistent with
the DSC results.

In summary, the abovementioned
results demonstrated that the HMW
enantiomeric polylactides could form a high degree stereocomplexation
upon cooling in the solvent of DBE. In addition, the relative molecular
weight mass was not decreased in production.

To further understand
the enhanced molecular mobility and mutual
diffusion of the enantiomeric polylactides in DBE, in situ FTIR measurements
of the mixtures upon cooling were carried out. The results are shown
in Figure 6. As it
shown, when the mixture cooled down from 110 to 20 °C, the intensity
of the peaks at 921 cm–1 became weak gradually (Figure 6a), but the intensity
of the peaks at 908 cm–1 became strong gradually
(Figure 6b). Finally,
the peak at 921 cm–1 vanished. These results demonstrated
that the enantiomers tended to form stereocomplex crystals, not homocrystals,
during the cooling process. In other words, the driving force for
stereocomplexation was stronger than the driving force for homocrystallization.14 The stronger driving force probably came from
the hydrogen bond of SCPLA (as shown in Figure 7). Therefore, the stereocomplexation was
predominant during the crystallization process.

In practical applications, polylactide not only
need to be made
SCPLA but also need to be SCPLA materials with certain morphology,
usage or function, such as fiber, film, particle, and so on. Here,
the thermally induced method could be used to generate porous SCPLA
materials. Figure 8 presents SEM images and the WXRD pattern of a typical porous membrane
of SC50. From Figure 8A, the pores are circular-like, micro-well structures with a diameter
of about 1–2 μm. Figure 8B shows that the membrane has the diffraction peaks
appearing at 2θ of around 12°, 21°, and 24°,
confirming the formation of the stereocomplex. The reason for forming
porous structures is probably the phase separation induced thermally.27

of the
SC50 porous film.

Additionally, SCPLA films
were made by hot press molding, and the
appearance is shown in Figure 9. Tensile tests were carried out and the stress–strain
curves of PLLA, PDLA, and SCPLA films are also presented in Figure 9. The tensile properties
are summarized in Table 1. The tensile strength and the Young’s modulus of SCPLA films
were enhanced slightly compared to the neat PLLA/PDLA. The SCPLA films
were not only stronger but also stiffer than the neat PLA films slightly.
The elongation at break values of PLLA, PDLA, and SCPLAs were nearly
the same, around 6–7%. The improved tensile modulus and strength
of the SCPLA films are probably due to enhanced intermolecular forces
resulted from the more close arrangement of molecules after stereocomplexation.

curves of SCPLAs, PLLA, and PDLA.

and PDLA

PLLA	3.89 ± 0.14	54.71 ± 3.72	7.94 ± 1.17	
PDLA	4.09 ± 0.40	55.04 ± 3.40	5.90 ± 2.31

SC100	4.96 ± 0.28	61.65 ± 1.72	6.78 ± 2.55	
When considering the crystal
stability of the SCPLA after hot pressing,
DSC analysis of the SC100 film (Figure 10A) revealed that the melting point of the
heating processes was around 226 °C, which is slightly lower
than that of SCPLA powder (228 °C). The enthalpy of the SC100
film was 74.7 J/g (Xc = 52.6%). There
was no homocrystal endothermic peak observed, and the degree of crystallinity
of the SC100 film was higher than that of SC100 powder. This might
be attributed to the role of the hot pressing temperature and pressure,
and 190 °C was selected as the hot pressing temperature, which
was higher than the end set melting temperature of neat PLA and lower
than the stereocomplex melting point. Therefore, the crystals of HCPLA
will be melted, but the stereocomplex crystals still existed and acted
as nucleation sites to induce crystallization in the molten PLA phase.28,29 The earlier research reported that when cooling from temperatures
below the stereocomplex melting point, the crystalline fraction of
the stereocomplex became larger than the stereocomplex without heat
treatment, implying that the nucleating effect of stereocomplex crystals
help increase the spherulite density.30

Figure 10 (A) DSC trace of the SC100 film made by hot press molding and (B)
WXRD pattern of the SC100 film.

WXRD analysis (Figure 10B) was carried out for the further confirmation of
the stereocomplex
structure of the SC100 film. It should be noticed that the small diffraction
peak at 2θ of 16.8° was vanished compared to the WXRD pattern
in Figure 4. Similarly,
the SC100 film had the diffraction peaks appearing at 2θ of
around 11.8°, 20.0°, and 23.9°, confirming the formation
of the stereocomplex. This might suggest the enhanced organization
of PLA molecular chains and more perfect crystals within the stereocomplex.31,32

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, an efficient and
reproducible thermally induced
method for the preparation of SCPLA with HMW is proposed. The approach
is environmentally friendly, easy to implement, and can easily be
scaled up. Using this technique, various forms of stereocomplex polylacides
materials which exhibit good thermal properties might be obtained,
such as powder, membrane, and film. Further research on SCPLA materials
to other forms using the thermally induced method in DBE and other
alternative solvents are now in progress.
