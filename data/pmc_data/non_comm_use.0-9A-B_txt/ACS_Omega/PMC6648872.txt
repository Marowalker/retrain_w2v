In
this article, we have investigated the enhanced second-harmonic
generation (SHG) from Fanolike resonance in an asymmetric homodimer
of gold elliptical nanodisks using a three-dimensional finite element
method. We have found that the broken symmetry will cause  Fanolike
resonances in the extinction spectrum, resulting in the enhancement
of SHG efficiency. When one of the gold elliptical nanodisks rotates,
the SHG efficiency increases first and then decreases. In addition,
we have also shown that the SHG signal blue-shifts with the reduction
of efficiency when the separation between two nanodisks increases.
Furthermore, when the nanodisks become thicker, the SHG signal also
blue-shifts with the increase of efficiency. The SHG signal from this
simple plasmonic structure with high efficiency and tunability may
pave a way toward practical applications in sensing and generating
a new light source.

1 Introduction
Plasmonic nanostructures
support surface plasmon resonances with
highly localized energy in nanoscale geometries, leading to a variety
of unique optical properties, such as negative refraction,1,2 hyperbolic dispersion,3,4 magnetic resonance,5−7 and perfect absorption.8 Besides these
linear phenomena, the strong enhancement of electric field near the
plasmonic nanostructure also leads to nonlinear optical processes.8−10 Among them, second-harmonic generation (SHG) is of great interest
in two aspects.11−17 In one aspect, second-order nonlinearity, such as SHG, is explicitly
forbidden in bulk crystals with a centrosymmetric lattice regardless
of the intensity of the applied field. This seems in contradiction
to both simulated and measured SHG effects from a large number of
plasmonic nanostructures, showing pronounced SHG emission owing to
surface plasmon resonances. In another aspect, second-order nonlinear
effects are usually stronger than the higher-order ones,  making
it easier to be observed and more feasible for practical applications.

Over the past few years, SHG from plasmonic nanostructures has
been widely investigated. It has been demonstrated that the SHG is
originated from centrosymmetry breaking at the metal surface.14,18 In addition, the near-field enhancement and the low radiation at
the fundamental frequency are the key factors to boost the SHG efficiency.
However, the near-field enhancement and the scattering efficiency
usually reach the maximum value simultaneously.19 Namely, it is difficult to obtain enhanced near field and
suppressed radiation loss at the same time. Nevertheless, plasmonic
nanostructures with Fano resonance may satisfy both these requirements,
resulting from a destructive interference between a bright mode and
a dark mode in plasmonic nanostructures.20−24 Fano resonance provides a framework for studying
light–matter interaction at the nanoscale and many fascinating
applications, such as sensors,25,26 filters,27 color routing,28 and
amplifying optical force.29 At the Fano
dip, the radiation loss will be efficiently suppressed and the near
field will be significantly enhanced, satisfying the key factors to
boost the SHG efficiency.30 Thus, enhanced
SHG from plasmonic nanostructures with Fano resonance has been extensively
studied.11,31−33 Walsh et al.  studied
the enhanced SHG by the coupling between long-range photonic resonances
and localized surface plasmon in periodic arrays of Au nanoparticles.34 Li et al. proposed to boost the SHG efficiency
by combining the advantages of Fano resonance and mode-matching in
a metasurface.35 Magnetic Fano resonance,
which has relatively low radiation,36 also
has been introduced to enhance SHG in plasmonic metamolecules.37,38 In simple terms, these works achieved enhanced SHG emission with
mode-matching,31,35 lattice resonance,33,34 and high-order resonances,32,37,38 requiring complex structures. Besides the plasmonic structure, all-dielectric
nanostructure-based nonlinearity has also been widely studied with
the Mie resonances in symmetric or asymmetric clusters and oligomers.39 Nevertheless, it could be still applicable to
investigate the enhancement of SHG in plasmonic structures from Fano
resonance.

In this article, we propose and demonstrate that
the Fano resonance
in an asymmetric homodimer, consisting of two gold elliptical nanodisks,
could enhance the SHG efficiency owing to the hybridization of plasmonic
modes. Using a three-dimensional (3-D) simulation method, we investigate
the effect of plasmon hybridization on the emitted SHG signal. When
one of the gold elliptical nanodisks rotates, the SHG efficiency increases
first and then decreases. In addition, we also show that the SHG signal
blue-shifts with the reduction of efficiency when the separation between
two nanodisks increases. Furthermore, when the nanodisks become thicker,
the SHG signal also blue-shifts with the increase of efficiency.

2 Electromagnetic Theoretical Methods
Figure 1 schematically
shows the geometry of the homodimer of gold elliptical nanodisks.
Here, a = 5 nm and b = 25 nm denote
the minor and major axis of the elliptical nanodisk, respectively.
The separation between the two nanodisks is S. The
homodimer is normally illuminated by a plane wave propagating along
the z-axis with polarization along the x-axis. The refractive index of gold is taken from experimental data.40 Without loss of generality, the surrounding
dielectric material is set to be air.

the homodimer of gold elliptical
nanodisks studied in this work, which is normally illuminated by a
plane wave from the top. (b) Top view of the homodimer of gold elliptical
nanodisks; a = 5 nm and b = 25 nm.
The dependences of the SHG emission on the separation S, the rotation angle θ of one elliptical nanodisk, and their
thicknesses are investigated.

Indeed, SHG is theoretically forbidden in centrosymmetric
media,
such as gold, in the dipolar approximation. Nevertheless, the centrosymmetry
could be locally broken at the surface of gold nanostructures, allowing
SHG emission. Considering the nonlocal effect, the surface contribution
to the SHG may be approximated by an effective nonlinear current at
the surface of gold nanostructure, which is described as14,18 1  where t̂ and n̂ are the unit vectors parallel and normal to the nanostructure
surface,
respectively. P1∥ = t̂·P1 and P1⊥ = n̂·P1, where P1 is the linear
polarization. This approach could well describe the SHG process that
may be easily implemented for full-field 3-D simulations. Note that
there are some other theoretically allowed but negligible contributions
to the SHG signal.14

All numerical
simulations were carried out using a three-dimensional
(3-D) finite element method in two steps.11,14,18 First, the scattering field of the homodimer
was simulated assuming a plane wave incidence at the fundamental frequency.
The perfect matched layer condition was used around the homodimer
to avoid nonphysical reflection of the outgoing electromagnetic wave.
Second, an effective nonlinear current, as described by eq 1, at the surface of the nanostructure
was applied as the source of the second-harmonic scattering process.
Then, both the near-field and far-field distributions can be computed
with a scattering model at SH frequency.

The SHG efficiency
in this article is defined as ηSHG = ScaSH/ExtFH, where ScaSH and
ExtFH are the scattering and extinction cross sections
around the second and the fundamental harmonic wavelengths, respectively.33 Note that it is different from the traditional
definition in experiments, where the SHG efficiency is calculated
by the intensity of SHG emission divided by that of the pump source.

3 Results and Discussion
We start from investigating
the linear and nonlinear optical properties
of a rotated gold elliptical nanodisk with a thickness (t) of 10 nm. Figure 2a,b shows the extinction cross section (ECS) spectra and the near-field
intensity of a single gold elliptical nanodisk at the fundamental
resonance wavelength (marked by the dashed line) as a function of
the rotation angle θ, respectively. At θ = 0, the incident
field is polarized along the minor axis of the elliptical nanodisk.
Indeed, the plasmon resonance of the minor axis is located at a higher
frequency. No significant resonance peak appears in the wavelength
range  600–800 nm. At θ = π/2, the incident
field is polarized along the major axis of the elliptical nanodisk
and a strong resonance peak appears at a wavelength of 706 nm. When
θ ≠ 0 or π/2, we could still observe only the resonance
peak of the major axis at a wavelength of 706 nm. Note that the resonances
of minor and major axes are both bright modes, whose eigenfrequencies
and intensities are dependent on the particle size. Figure 2c,d shows the SHG efficiency
and the near-field intensity of a single gold elliptical nanodisk
at the corresponding SHG wavelength (marked by the dashed line) as
a function of the rotation angle θ, respectively. When θ
increases from 0 to π/2, the SHG efficiency gradually increases
owing to the major axis plasmon resonance of the gold elliptical nanodisk.
The near-field intensity at the SHG wavelength may further demonstrate
that the major axis resonance is stronger than the minor axis resonance.

distribution at the fundamental resonance wavelength. (c) SHG efficiency
of a single gold elliptical nanodisk at various rotation angles θ
and (d) the corresponding near-field distribution at the SHG resonance
wavelength. The thickness of a single elliptical nanodisk is t = 10 nm.

Besides these two bright modes, the gold elliptical nanodisk
may
also support a dark quadrupole mode, which can be excited by a near-field
dipole source rather than a far-field incident wave. In addition,
the plasmon resonance of the minor axis is far away from that of the
major axis, indicating the difficulty of coupling between them. In
the case of the asymmetric homodimer, the plasmon resonance of the
major axis of the rotated nanodisk may act as a near-field dipole
source and excite the dark mode in the other nanodisk. This means
that a super-radiant bright mode strongly interacts with a subradiant
dark mode via near-field coupling, producing a low-energy (bonding)
and a high-energy (antibonding) hybridized mode.41,42 As a result, a Fanolike resonance appears in the linear ECS spectrum
and enhances the near-field intensity at both bonding and antibonding
modes, thereby boosting the SHG efficiency.

To demonstrate this, Figure 3a shows the ECS spectrum
of the homodimer as a function of
the rotation angle of one gold elliptical nanodisk. The separation
(S) of the homodimer and the thickness (t) of the nanodisk are fixed as 32 and 10 nm, respectively. At θ
= 0, the homodimer is a symmetric structure with respect to the incident
electromagnetic field. It is well known that we may not observe the
Fanolike resonance in this case, as demonstrated by the black line
in Figure 3a. When
θ increases, the symmetry of the homodimer is broken, resulting
in the hybridized subradiant and super-radiant modes. Hence, we can
observe a Fanolike resonance in the ECS spectrum. When the value of
θ approaches π/2, the homodimer recovers to be a symmetric
structure with respect to the incident field and, consequently, the
Fano dip becomes shallow and narrow.

Figure 3 (a) Extinction cross section and (b) SHG
efficiency of a homodimer
of gold elliptical nanodisks for one of them at various rotation angles
θ. The thickness of elliptical nanodisks is t = 10 nm. The separation is S = 32 nm. The dashed
line in (a) indicates red shifting of the Fano resonance.

Figure 3b shows
the corresponding SHG efficiency as a function of the rotation angle
of one gold elliptical nanodisk. At θ = 0, the SHG efficiency
is not significantly improved because of the absence of the Fanolike
resonance. When the value of θ increases, the SHG efficiency
is boosted because of the enhanced Fano resonance and near-field intensity
at the surface of the nanostructure. At around θ = π/4,
the SHG efficiency is the highest, resulting from the maximum symmetry
breaking and the deepest Fano resonance. When the value of θ
approaches π/2, the capacitive coupling between the hybridized
subradiant and super-radiant modes reduces because the homodimer becomes
symmetrical in this case, thereby leading to a decreased SHG efficiency.

For further demonstration, Figure 4 plots the near-field and far-field distributions of
the electric field intensity for the cases θ = π/4 and
0 at different SHG wavelengths (as marked by points I, II, and III
in Figure 2b). From Figure 4a–d, we can
easily see that the SHG signal is significantly enhanced in the asymmetric
homodimer in comparison to that in the symmetric case because of the
excitation of Fanolike resonance and the near-field enhancement at
the fundamental wavelength. In addition, the difference between the
far-field patterns in symmetric and asymmetric cases indicates that
the radiated direction of the SHG signal could be manipulated by engineering
the plasmon hybridization. This property is critical to the design
of practical applications in the nonlinear regime.

Figure 4 (a) Near-field and (b)
far-field distributions of the electric
field intensity for the case θ = π/4 at different SHG
wavelengths, as marked by points I, II, and III in Figure 3b. For comparison, (c) near-field
and (d) far-field distributions of the electric field intensity for
the case θ = 0 at the corresponding SHG wavelength are also
shown. The thickness of elliptical nanodisks is t = 10 nm. The separation is S = 32 nm.

According to the plasmon hybridization model, the
capacitive coupling
strength between super-radiant and subradiant modes is dependent on
the separation S. Therefore, we investigate the influence
of the Fanolike resonance on the SHG efficiency by tuning the separation
between the gold elliptical nanodisks in the asymmetric homodimer.
The thicknesses of nanodisks and the rotation angles are fixed as t =10 nm and θ = π/4, respectively. As shown
in Figure 5a, a decrease
in the separation between the two nanodisks makes the Fano dip in
the ECS spectra wider and deeper. This is because the capacitive coupling
between the super-radiant and subradiant modes becomes stronger, thereby
concentrating more energy in the near-field of the homodimer. In addition,
the enhanced coupling leads to red and blue shifts of the low- and
high-energy peaks, respectively. These linear optical properties are
consistent with the plasmon hybridization theory. Figure 5b plots the SHG efficiency
at various separation distances, S, of 28, 30, 32,
34, and 36 nm. When the nanodisks move close to each other, the emitted
SHG signals from the bonding and antibonding modes are red- and blue-shifted,
respectively. Furthermore, the SHG efficiency is significantly enhanced
because of the strong capacitive coupling at a small separation distance. Figure 5c,d presents the
near- and far-field distributions, respectively, of the electric field
at the high-energy SHG peak with separation distances, S, of 36, 34, 32, 30, and 28 nm, further validating the enhanced SHG
efficiency from the Fanolike resonance. Note that the SHG efficiency
could increase further when the separation S is reduced.
The smallest value of S should make sure that the
narrowest gap between two plasmonic nanoparticles is larger than 2
nm, under which the quantum tunneling effect between two plasmonic
nanoparticles should be taken into consideration.43

Figure 5 (a) Extinction cross section and (b) SHG efficiency of the homodimer
of gold elliptical nanodisks for various separation distances. The
thickness of elliptical nanodisks is t = 10 nm. The
rotation angle is θ = 45°. The dashed lines show that the
Fano resonance becomes stronger when the separation decreases. (c)
Near-field and (d) far-field distributions of the electric field intensity
at the wavelength of enhanced SHG emission for various separation
distances.

The capacitive coupling strength
between the super-radiant and
subradiant modes also depends on the thicknesses of the nanodisks. Figure 6a plots the linear
ECS spectrum with different nanodisk thicknesses, t = 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 nm, while keeping the rotation angle and
separation fixed as θ = π/2 and S = 32
nm, respectively. It is obvious that both the subradiant and super-radiant
modes red-shift with the increasing nanodisk thickness, which agrees
well with the LC circuit theory.44,45 Besides, the
Fano dip becomes wider and deeper because of the enhanced coupling
strength. These phenomena demonstrate that more electromagnetic energy
is localized at the surface of nanostructures, which is beneficial
for SHG efficiency. Figure 6b shows the corresponding
SHG emission with different nanodisk thicknesses. We could observe
that the SHG emission moves to higher frequency as the nanodisks become
thicker. Owing to the increased coupling strength between subradiant
and super-radiant modes, the SHG efficiency is significantly enhanced
by a factor of about 5, whereas the thickness of nanodisks is increased
from t = 8 to 16 nm.

Figure 6 (a) Extinction cross section and (b) SHG
efficiency of the homodimer
of gold elliptical nanodisks for various thicknesses. The rotation
angle is θ = 45°. The separation is S =
32 nm. The dashed lines show that  both the Fano resonance and
the SHG emission become stronger and blue shift, when the thickness
increases.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we have proposed and demonstrated the enhanced SHG
from a homodimer, consisting of two gold elliptical nanodisks, using
a 3-D simulation method. The results show that the Fanolike resonance
in an asymmetric homodimer may result in enhanced SHG efficiency owing
to the plasmon hybridization. In addition, the enhanced SHG signal,
including the radiation direction and frequency, could be manipulated
by engineering the coupling between hybridized super-radiant and subradiant
modes. Our results may provide an effective approach to enhance SHG
efficiency in plasmonic structures and also find practical applications
in nonlinear optical devices.
