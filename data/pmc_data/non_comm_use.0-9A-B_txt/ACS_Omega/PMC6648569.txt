A mechanism for the formation of
pantoprazole related compound
E (RC E) is proposed involving the formation of a radical cation in
the pH range of 5–8. pH dependence of RC E is demonstrated,
and the contribution of the difluoromethoxy group in stabilizing the
C-6 free radical, a prerequisite to the formation of the dimer byproduct,
is discussed. Also, the synthesis of pantoprazole RC E is reported
using the benzidine rearrangement.

Introduction
Active pharmaceutical
ingredients (APIs) must meet the purity criteria
set by internationally recognized pharmacopeia such as the United
States Pharmacopeia (USP). Quantification of known impurities, referred
to as related compound (RC) or related substances (RS), and unknown
impurities is a regulatory requirement and must be reported on the
Certificate of Analysis of APIs.1 Accordingly,
the purity of APIs is of paramount importance to their manufacturers,
who carry out extensive R&D to minimize the formation of byproducts
in various synthetic steps. Also, purification of an API is usually
the most difficult step in its production and can be facilitated by
suppressing byproduct formation. This, in turn, requires a thorough
understanding of the mechanism of formation of impurities, which,
once established, provides opportunities to manipulate reaction conditions
to minimize their formation, generation of waste, and to improve the
reaction yield.

Primary reference standards (PRS), available
from recognized pharmacopeias,
are used in validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
protocols. They provide relative retention time and response factor
of each impurity at the wavelength described by the pharmacopeia,
allowing quantification the RCs. PRS are very expensive, usually costing
hundreds of dollars for 5–20 mg. Accordingly, API and Drug
Product manufacturers use secondary reference standards (SRS, also
known as working standards or house standards) for routine analysis
of APIs. SRS are purchased from reputable suppliers or synthesized
in-house. SRS must be characterized (IR, UV, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry (MS)), their purity and assay
determined (HPLC), and must be established to be identical to their
PRS. This is referred to as “specification” and involves
the comparison of at least two spectroscopic characteristics of the
SRS with its PRS. To this end, λmax and HPLC retention
time are usually used, both of which can be determined in a single
HPLC experiment and compared to the PRS values.2

Pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate (PAN–Na+·1.5H2O) binds to cystein 822 of H+/K+ATPase as an irreversible inhibitor.3 The protein, also referred to as the proton pump,
transfers
H+ from the blood into parietal cells of the stomach with
concomitant transfer of K+ from the cells into the blood.4 The USP identifies five known impurities, namely,
RC A, B, D, and F (mixture) and RC E (mixture of isomers).5 There is very little information available on
RC E in the chemical literature. It has not been assigned a Chemical
Abstracts Service (CAS) number, and there is no report on its mechanism
of formation or its synthesis. It is therefore a “phantom”
chemical entity in the abovementioned terms. In this report, we propose
a pH-dependent mechanism for the formation of RC E and report its
synthesis using the benzidine rearrangement.

Results and Discussion
Pantoprazole is synthesized by the condensation of 5-difluoromethoxy-2-mercaptobenzimidazole
(1) with 2-chloromethyl-3,4-dimethoxypyridine hydrochloride
(2) to afford a thioether (3), which is
subsequently oxidized to the product. Sodium hypochlorite is usually
used as the oxidizing reagent because of its low cost and commercial
availability.6 Other oxidizing reagents
such as hydrogen peroxide with metal oxide catalysts,7 peracids,8 and N-bromosuccinamide9 have also been used
to affect the conversion of thioethers to sulfoxides (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Commercial Production
of PAN–Na+·1.5H2O
The USP specifies five RCs
for PAN–Na+·1.5H2O.5 These are shown
in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 PAN–Na+·1.5H2O USP RCs
RCs A, B, and C are anticipatory.
RC A is a product of overoxidation
of pantoprazole (sulfoxide) to the corresponding sulfone. RC B is
the penultimate thioether intermediate, and RC C is one of the two
starting materials used in the synthesis of PAN–Na+·1.5H2O.

RC D and RC F are a
mixture of N-2 and N-7 methylation of the benzimidazole
moiety. No reasonable mechanism for their formation has been provided.10 In some methods, however, a mixture of dichloromethane
and methanol is used with peracids11 or
with sodium hypochlorite12 for the oxidation
of the thioether wherein methanol may be converted to formaldehyde
and formic acid, possibly resulting in Eschweiler–Clarke reaction13 and affording trace amounts of the N-2 and N-7
methylated byproducts. Perhaps more importantly, commercial methanol
may contain trace quantities of formaldehyde,14 which is subsequently converted to formic acid in the presence of
sodium hydroxide.15 In fact, the formation
of trace amounts of methylated drug substances during routine analytical
experiments has been attributed to the presence of trace amounts of
formaldehyde in HPLC-grade methanol. Finally, it should be noted that
the N-2 and N-7 methylation byproduct is limited to pantoprazole and
omeprazole, both of which contain an electron-donating group on C-5
of the benzimidazole moiety (Table 1). The methoxy group (omeprazole) and the difluoromethyoxy
group (pantoprazole) can expedite the Eschweiler–Clarke reaction
by inductive effects. We used methyl iodide in refluxing dichloromethane
for the methylation of pantoprazole to obtain RC D/RC F.

The formation of RC E requires close inspection for a number of
reasons. First, although RC E is included as a known impurity in all
major pharmacopeias, this dimer compound has not been assigned a CAS
number. Second, we could not uncover any information on its mechanism
of formation or its synthesis in the chemical literature. And third,
and most interesting, although all proton pump inhibitors share a
common molecular skeleton and differ only with regard to the substituents
on both heterocyclic rings (Table 1), the dimer impurity (RC E) has been observed only
in the case of pantoprazole. This is particularly noteworthy when
comparing the C-5 substituent of pantoprazole with omeprazole.

The formation of biaryals has been studied extensively, and nearly
all mechanistic routes involve oxidative coupling of the aromatic
rings using free-radical-forming reagents such as (Tl(CF3COO)3/CF3COOH)16 and AgNO3/MeCN, followed by NaClO4 and MeO–Na/MeOH, room temperature (rt);17 FeCl3/CH2Cl2, rt; MeOH;18 FeCl3/no solvent, 50 °C;19 MoCl5/CH2Cl2, 0 °C;20 CuCl2, MeOH,
and (CH3)3CNH2, 50 °C;21 and H2O2.22 Other methods of biaryl formation involve activation of
the carbon atom of the aromatic ring. This may be accomplished by
(a) halogenation, followed by reaction with copper (Ulmann reaction),23 zinc (Negishi reaction),24 or magnesium (Grignard reaction);25 (b) halogenation, followed by boric acid analogue formation25 and condensation in the presence of palladium
catalysts such as Pd(PPh3)4 (Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction);26 and (c) nitration, followed
by reduction and the formation of diazide salt (Gutterman or Gomberg–Bachmann–Hey
reaction).27 However, none of these reactions
are employed in the synthesis of the benzimidazole moiety, and therefore
it is unlikely that RC E is formed from a benzimidazole biaryl impurity.
Accordingly, a different mechanism must be operative in the formation
of RC E.

Considering the similarity of the C-5 substituents
of pantoprazole
(CHF2–O−) and omeprazole (CH3–O−),
it is reasonable to assume that CHF2–O– imparts
a unique property to the benzimidazole moiety of pantoprazole, which
promotes biaryl formation during the production of this drug substance.
A review of the literature shows that nearly all reported methods
for the production of pantoprazole employ highly basic pH reaction
media, which results in the formation of pantoprazole sodium salt.
Lower pH is avoided since proton pump inhibitors are known to undergo
extensive degradation. In fact, their stability in aqueous solution
is pH dependent; the rate of degradation increases with decreasing
pH, resulting in intense discoloration.28 However, in some of the reported procedures, the pH of the mixture
is lowered to about 7.5–929 at the
end of synthesis in order to convert the benzimidazole sodium salt
to benzimidazole, thereby increasing its log P (partition coefficient) and allowing for its extraction into an
organic solvent. Upon the separation of the aqueous phase, the organic
phase containing pantoprazole free base is treated with the appropriate
amount of sodium hydroxide to reform PAN–Na+, and an adequate quantity of water is added to form and isolate
PAN–Na+·1.5H2O as the
pharmacopeia drug substance.29

We
have not observed the formation of RC E in numerous experiments
carried out at high pH. It therefore occurred to us that the formation
of RC E may be limited to those processes in which log P of pantoprazole is temporarily increased for its extraction
into an organic phase (vide supra). This contention was tested by
subjecting PAN–Na+·1.5H2O to pH of 5–8 for 24 h and measuring the formation of RC
E in each experiment by a validated HPLC method. The results are shown
in Figure 1 and demonstrate
that in fact the formation of RC E is a pH-dependent phenomenon, increasing
with decreasing pH. Although sodium hypochlorite serves as an oxidizing
agent in the conversion of thioether (compound 3) to
pantoprazole, the potential effect of atmospheric oxygen on the formation
of RC E was examined by carrying out the oxidation reaction in deoxygenated
solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere. No significant change in the
amount of RC E formation was observed as compared to normal reaction
conditions.

Figure 1 Formation of RC E as a function of pH.

Recently, Previtera et al.30 have
reported
a free-radical-cation mechanism for the degradation of proton pump
inhibitors in low-pH aqueous media. Also, Reddy et al.29a have shown that the formation of RC E is preferred
in aqueous medium as compared to organic solvents during the oxidation
step. This is in line with our experimental observation of pH-dependent
formation of the RC E in water.

It is important to note that
dimer impurity has not been observed
for other proton pump inhibitors, which share a common skeleton with
pantoprazole but do not have a difluoromethoxy group on C-5 of their
benzimidazole moiety. In the case of omeprazole, there is a methoxy
group on C-5 of the benzimidazole moiety, and the difference between
the two inhibitors is narrowed down to the presence (pantoprazole)
or the absence (omeprazole) of two fluorine atoms on the C-5 methoxy
group. Therefore, the difluoromethoxy group must impart a unique property
to the benzimidazole ring, allowing it to undergo dimer formation.

The captodative effect has been proposed to facilitate and stabilize
free-radical formation because of the contributions of electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substituents.31 The contribution of the captodative effect to the free energy of
formation of radicals is small and on the order of a few kcal/mol.
Therefore, the importance of captodative effect to radical formation
has been a subject of debate. Nonetheless, there appears to be general
agreements on two points. First, the captodative effect is expected
when substituents are directly connected to the atom that will form
the radical, and second, stabilized, short-lived radicals form dimers
in high yields.32 Both of these criteria
are applicable to the formation of RC E. Furthermore, Parsafar et
al. have carried out comparative theoretical calculations on the stability
of the CF2 and CH2 free radicals and have reported
that CHF2 is a highly reactive site for free-radical formation,
affording a more stable free radical.33 Combined, the free-radical-cation mechanism of Previtera et al.
and the synergistic effect of the two fluorine atoms (electron withdrawing)
as well as the oxygen atom (electron donating) may be the determining
factor for the formation of RC E biaryl in the case of pantoprazole.
Application of Previtera’s free-radical-cation formation is
shown in Scheme 3 for
pantoprazole. Captodative effect of CHF2O– group
on imparting additional stability for C-6 aromatic free radical is
demonstrated in Scheme 4.

Scheme 3 Cation-free-Radical Mechanism for the Formation of RC E
Scheme 4 Captodative Effect of CHF2O Group on Imparting Additional
Stability for C-6 Aromatic Free Radical
The captodative effect of difluoromethoxy group on stabilizing
free radical 5 is shown in Scheme 4.

It is reasonable to assume that the
central difference between
omeprazole, which does not form a dimer byproduct, and pantoprazole
lies in the presence of two fluorine atoms of the 4-methoxy function.
Whereas the methoxy group in omperazole is only electron donating,
the difluoromethoxy group of pantoprazole is endowed with the duality
of being electron donating (oxygen atom) and concomitantly electron
withdrawing (two fluorine atoms).34 Therefore,
the difluoromethoxy group imparts a synergistic captodative effect
on pantoprazole, allowing for the formation of the biaryl impurity
at pH ≤ 8. Finally, inductive effects of the nitrogen atoms
of the imidazole ring may prevent the formation of 3,3′- or
the 6,6′-biaryl, leaving C-6 as the only candidate for free-radical
formation35 (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of RC E Using the Benzidine
Rearrangement
For direct comparison
of the dimer byproduct with authentic RC
E, we synthesized RC E using the benzidine rearrangement as shown
in Scheme 5. The rearrangement
was carried out on 3-(difluoromethoxy)nitrobenzene affording the corresponding
benzidine hydrochloride. The latter was acetylated and nitrated and
the nitro groups reduced to afford the penultimate intermediate for
the formation of the biaryl of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole. The resulting
dimer is used as substrate for the synthesis of RC E, using the established
method for the synthesis of pantoprazole. To this end, the biaryl
of 2-mercaptobenenzimidazole is condensed with compound 2 affording the corresponding thioether, which is subjected to sodium
hypochlorite oxidation to afford PAN RC E.

The mechanism of
the benzidine rearrangement for the formation
of compound 18 is shown in Scheme 6.36

Scheme 6 Benzidine
Rearrangement
Conclusions
Our
results demonstrate that the formation of pantoprazole dimer
(RC E) is pH dependent, and this byproduct forms only at pH values ≤8. There is a direct relation between the pH value
and the rate of formation of the biaryl impurity. A mechanism for
the formation of pantoprazole dimer RC is proposed based on free-radical-cation
formation at pH 5–8.

The contribution of the difluoromethoxy
group in stabilizing the
C-6 free radical is discussed in terms of the captodative effect,
its dual character as an electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
group, as well as the synergistic contribution that transpires from
this duality. Combined, our experimental results and recent reports
on the unique properties of difluoromethoxy group provide a reasonable
explanation for the exclusivity of pantoprazole for dimer formation.
Although not the main objective of this report, a brief explanation
for the formation of RC D/RC F is provided.

Pharmaceutical-grade
PAN–Na+·1.5H2O (0.5 g,
1.15 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of deionized water (2.5 mL)
and dichloromethane (2.5 mL), and the pH of the mixture was adjusted
to 8, 7, 6, and 5 in separate 25 mL round-bottom flasks (RBF). The
reaction mixtures were stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere for 24
h. The organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate,
and thereafter the solvent was removed under reduced pressure at 30
°C. The resulting solids were submitted to HPLC analysis using
the validated HPLC method of USP 39. The chromatograms were analyzed
for the level of RC E. Each run was spiked with synthetic RC E to
ascertain the retention time and response factors. The results are
shown in Figure 1.

In
a 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was
added dichloromethane (50 mL) and PAN–Na+·1.5H2O (10 g, 23 mmol). About 10 mL of the solvent
was distilled, and thereafter methyl iodide (3.7 g, 26 mmol) was added,
the mixture was refluxed for 3 h, and reaction progress was monitored
by TLC (CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH4OH 80:20:1).
After reaction completion, the mixture was cooled to 25 °C, filtered,
and washed with dichloromethane. The filtrate was concentrated under
reduced pressure until turbidity was observed. The mixture was cooled
to 10 °C and stirred for 3 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered,

In a 1 L RBF equipped with
a mechanical stirrer,

then yellow (hydrazobenzene formation) and was completed in 16 h.
The mixture was then evaporated under reduced pressure to remove about
400 mL of the solvent. Thereafter, water (100 mL) and diethyl ether

for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture was filtered over a Celite
bed and washed with diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL). The organic layer
was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether
(100 mL). Combined organic layers were transferred into a 1 L additional
funnel and added dropwise over a 2 h period to 350 mL of 32% HCl (equal
to 7 volumes to compound 17), which was previously cooled
to 5–10 °C. The mixture was stirred for a further 1 h,
the orange mixture was filtered, and the creamy cake was washed with
100 mL of 5% HCl and then with diethyl ether (2 × 200 mL). The

2,2′-Bis(difluoromethoxy)-5,5′-4,4′-biphenylenetetraamine
(22)
In a 100 mL RBF, compound 21 (4.97 g, 12.2 mmol) was suspended in 1,4-dioxane (225 mL) and heated
until a clear solution was obtained. Methanol (100 mL) and ethanol
(50 mL) were then added to the yellow solution. Aqueous sodium hydroxide
(2.93 g, 73.3 mmol, and 60 mL of water) was added to the yellow solution,
and the resulting orange solution was heated to 70 °C. Thereafter,
zinc dust (17.6 g, 269 mmol, <63 μm) was added within 5 min,
and the mixture was refluxed for 6–8 h, at which time the orange
mixture becomes almost colorless. Reaction completion was ascertained
by TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH 85:15:1). The hot mixture
was filtered over a bed of Celite and washed with hot MeOH (50 mL),
and the yellow filtrate was used for the next step without further
purification. (Note: The filtrate must be used immediately; otherwise,
it decomposes to a dark brown solution.) A small quantity of the filtrate
was sampled as standard for TLC comparison for the next step.

6,6′-Bis(difluoromethoxy)-2,2′-bis(mercaptobenzimidazole)
(23)
To the 1 L RBF equipped with a reflux condenser
was added the yellow solution from a previous step and then charged
with carbon disulfide (8.86 mL, 146 mmol) and aqueous potassium hydroxide
(5.46 g, 97.6 mmol, and 30 mL of water), and the resulting yellow
solution was heated to reflux temperature and stirred for 3 h. The
reaction was monitored by TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH 85:15:1). After reaction completion, the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure to afford an oily orange residue, which was then
dissolved in water (80 mL) and methanol (80 mL) and heated to 70 °C.
Thereafter, acetic acid was added to adjust the pH to 7. The resulting
creamy mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then filtered
and washed with a 1:1 mixture of methanol/water (3 × 30 mL) and
finally washed with n-heptane (50 mL) and dried at
room temperature to yield 4.73 g (90%) of the titled compound as a
creamy powder, mp: 249 °C (dec). 1H NMR (500 MHz,

6,6′-Bis(difluoromethoxy)-2,2′-bis(((3,4-dimethoxypyridin-2-yl)methyl)thio)-1H,1′H-5,5′-bib-enzimidazole
(15)
In a 250 mL flask, sodium hydroxide (2.28
g, 55.5 mmol) was dissolved in water (96 mL) and stirred at room temperature.
Compound 23 (4.8 g, 11.1 mmol) was added to the sodium
hydroxide solution, and the mixture was stirred to dissolution. Compound 2 (4.97 g, 22.2 mmol) was dissolved in water (49.7 mL), and
the resulting solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture
over a period of 90 min. The reaction was monitored by TLC (CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH 85:15:1). Upon the disappearance of
compound 23 on TLC, the mixture was maintained at rt
for 1 h and then filtered, washed with water (10 mL), and dried at
50 °C to afford 3.2 g (94%) of the titled compound as a creamy
powder, mp: 128–130 °C. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.95 (br s, 2H, −NH), 8.29 (d, 3J = 5.6 Hz, 2H, Py-H), 7.52 (s, 2H, Ar-H),

(PAN RC E, 8)
In a 100 mL RBF was added methanol
(36 mL) and compound 15 (1.5 g, 2 mmol), and the mixture
was stirred at room temperature. A solution of 3% sodium hypochlorite
(20.2 g, 8.2 mmol), sodium hydroxide (0.49 g, 12.3 mmol), and water
(5 mL) was then added slowly to the dark yellow solution within 50
min. The reaction was monitored by TLC (CHCl3/MeOH 90:10)
and was completed in 1 h. The mixture was then washed with dichloromethane
(3 × 25 mL). The aqueous phase was evaporated under reduced pressure,
and the oily red residue was purified by column chromatography on
silica gel (CHCl3/MeOH 95:5). Fractions containing the
dimer were pulled, decolorized with charcoal (0.7 g), filtered over
a Celite bed, and washed with CHCl3/MeOH (20 mL, 95:5).
The yellow filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain
a brown gummy precipitate, which was then suspended in diethyl ether
(8 mL) and filtered, washed with diethyl ether, and dried under reduced
pressure at room temperature to a constant weight to afford 0.32 g
