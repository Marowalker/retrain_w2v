Herein, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
acid-doped polyaniline (PTP) nanofibers with/without photoreactive
anatase TiO2 (TiO2–PTP and PTP, respectively)
have been successively synthesized and subsequently decorated by Pt
nanoparticles (Pt NPs) to prepare Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP composites. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy confirms the presence of ∼3 nm spherical-shaped
Pt NPs on both the composites along with TiO2 on Pt–TiO2–PTP. Pt loading on the composites is deliberately
kept similar to compare the methanol electro-oxidation in the two
composites. The Pt nanocomposites along with the precursor polyanilines
are characterized by optical characterization, X-ray diffraction study,
X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The ternary
composite-modified (Pt–TiO2–PTP) electrode
demonstrates high electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation
reaction in acid medium than Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2. The higher electrochemical surface area (1.7 times), high forward/backward
current ratio, and the higher CO tolerance ability for Pt–TiO2–PTP make it a superior catalyst for methanol oxidation
reaction in the electrochemical process than Pt–PTP. Moreover,
the catalytic activity of Pt–TiO2–PTP is
further enhanced significantly with light irradiation. The cooperative
effects of photo- and electrocatalysis on methanol oxidation reaction
in Pt–TiO2–PTP enhance the methanol oxidation
catalytic activity approximately 1.3 times higher in light illumination
than in dark. Therefore, the present work will be proficient to get
a light-assisted sustainable approach for developing the methanol
oxidation reaction activity of Pt NP-containing catalysts in direct
methanol fuel cells.

1 Introduction
The growing demands for sustainable energy
lead to the continuous investigation of alternative energy sources.
In this regard, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have engrossed
noteworthy consideration as promising renewable energy sources for
portable electronics, electric vehicles, and other transportation
media owing to their superior utilization efficiency, low pollution
rate, cost-effectiveness, ease of synthesis, low functioning temperature,
and so on.1−7 However, the utmost negative downside
for a broad commercial application of DMFCs is the fabrication of
high-performance and long-lasting anodic compounds for the methanol
oxidation reaction (MOR).8 Till date, efficient
noble metals like Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) are still being used as
the most studied anodic materials as electrocatalysts for DMFCs owing
to their outstanding electrocatalytic performance.9,10 However,
a pure Pt electrocatalyst easily suffers from some intrinsic drawbacks
like high cost and less durability, as it possesses less resistance
to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, which must be sorted out for the
commercialization of DMFCs.11,12 The catalyst poisoning
is initiated by the robust interaction of intermediary-generated CO
species with Pt NP active sites and leads to a rapid deactivation
of the Pt catalyst to diminish its technological viability.13,14 The oxidation of the adsorbed CO by the generated −OH species
on the Pt surface at a higher potential efficiently slows down the
MOR process significantly.15 Hence, the
development of high CO tolerance with better stability and superb
catalytic performance in electrocatalysts is the key issue herein.
To evaluate the solution with regard to CO-based catalytic poisoning,
coupling of Pt NPs with other metal oxides like TiO2, SnO2, ZnO, Co3O4, and carbon materials has
been investigated to improve the electrocatalytic performance and
durability of Pt NPs successfully in electrocatalytic methanol oxidation.16−22 The combined effect of Pt NPs and these materials
is possibly the main reason for betterment. Metal oxides generally
adsorb −OH and consequently convert the catalyst-adsorbed CO
to CO2 to restore the active sites of Pt NPs for continuous
electrocatalytic activity and effectively mitigate CO poisoning of
Pt NPs to improve the catalytic performance for methanol oxidation.

Among the photoexcited semiconducting metal oxides, TiO2 is the most promising as a support material for electrocatalytic
methanol oxidation owing to its enhanced photocatalytic activity,
durability, cost-effectiveness, and self-cleaning property.23−27 As TiO2 has a powerful oxidation
characteristic under UV light excitation, it has attracted huge attention
of the researchers since Kamat et al. first employed it as a support
material for MOR under UV light as a photocatalyst.28−31 TiO2 can improve the MOR performance of the noble metal electrocatalyst
by two ways; first, it assists the methanol oxidation by photoexcitation
as it has a 3.2 eV band gap, and second, by its self-cleaning ability,
it decreases the CO poisoning of the catalyst as stated earlier. The
UV light excitation on TiO2 excites the valence band (VB)
electrons to the conduction band and consequently creates negative
electron–positive hole pairs (e––h+).32 The photogenerated e––h+ pairs can effectively produce the hydroxyl
radical (•OH) which can also oxidize the adsorbed
methanol to CO2.

TiO2, in spite of having
several advantages of being employed as a support material for noble
metal electrocatalysts for methanol oxidation, reduces the electronic
conductivity of the electrode materials.33 Thus, a lot of research is going on recently to investigate the
proper conducting support materials which can work as electron transport
media from anodes to metal electrocatalysts as well as a binder for
TiO2 and noble metal composites. Generally, conducting
carbon materials, like reduced graphene oxides, carbon black, carbon
nanotubes, and so forth, and conducting polymers are used for this
purpose.27,30,34,35 Among the conducting polymers, polyaniline (PANI)
is the most interesting as it contains exceptionally high electrical
conductivity in doped state, high stability, ecofriendliness, ease
of synthesis, and cost-effectiveness.36,37 Again, the
amine (−NH−) moieties of the PANI main chain provide
the nucleation centers for the Pt NPs to firmly anchor on top of the
PANI surface and successively improve the dispersion of Pt NPs on
the PANI matrix.6,34 PANI extends the N-containing
adsorption sites for Pt NPs in a composite, averts the Pt NP agglomeration,
and efficiently improve the homogeneous dispersion of Pt NPs in a
polymer matrix by trimming down the size.38 Also, by interacting with water in electrolyte, it can assist the
conversion of CO to CO2 during MOR to increase the CO tolerance
of the modified electrode material.39,40 On the other
hand, PANI exhibits great potential as a photosensitizer because of
its low band gap and π–π* transition.41 Hence, doping of PANI with TiO2 can
reduce the band gap of TiO2 and shift the optical response
to be excited at the visible light region. Therefore, there is enormous
scope to use controlled nanostructured PANI as a conducting support
for electrocatalysts to further upsurge the photo-assisted electrocatalytic
performance of Pt–TiO2-based electrode materials.

Herein, in this report, we present an easy procedure for the decoration
of Pt NPs by embedding them in high-aspect-ratio perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic
acid-doped PANI (PTP) nanofibers and PTP nanofibers preloaded with
TiO2 (Scheme 1). Earlier, Rana et al. reported high-aspect-ratio PTP nanofibers
with a very high electrical conductivity of 10–3 S cm–1.42 The nanofiber
structure of PTP can serve a very high surface area for the decoration
of TiO2 and Pt NPs herein. We modified the synthesis technique
to prepare TiO2–PTP nanofibers by in situ polymerization
of PTP in the presence of nanostructured anatase TiO2.
The synthesized Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP
composites have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray
fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM), and Raman spectroscopy studies. The prepared surfactant-free
Pt NPs on PTP nanofibers (Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP) have been employed as light-assisted electrocatalysts
for MOR in acidic medium. The electrocatalytic properties of PTP-containing
catalysts were also compared with a without PTP catalyst Pt–TiO2 to evaluate the role of PTP.
Interestingly, the electrocatalytic performance of methanol oxidation
has been distinctly improved in Pt–TiO2–PTP
compared to Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2. With the
aid of UV light irradiation on Pt–TiO2–PTP,
the methanol oxidation activity was significantly enhanced further.
Therefore, the present article provides a highly proficient UV light-assisted
worthwhile approach for the improvement of the MOR catalytic performance
of Pt-based electrocatalysts in DMFCs.

of (a) PTP
and (b) Pt–TiO2–PTP
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphological Studies
The synthesis of
the PANI nanofiber PTP from aniline is shown in Scheme 1a. The TiO2–PTP composite
is prepared by the same procedure used for PTP, taking 20% (w/w) TiO2 at the time of polymerization of aniline. The fabrication
of Pt NPs on PTP of the TiO2–PTP polymer fiber composite
is illustrated in Scheme 1b.

The FESEM image study in Figure 1a,b reveals the formation of the TiO2 nanosphere of the diameter range of ∼250–500
nm by the solution combustion route. Again, the FESEM study of PANIs
in Figure 1c–f
demonstrates one-dimensional (1D) PTP nanofibers with the diameter
range of ∼50–100 nm (Figure 1c). However, the average diameter is slightly
increased to >100 nm in TiO2–PTP (Figure 1d), possibly because of the
inclusion of bigger TiO2 nanospheres which completely mingled
with the PANI nanostructures to provide 1D nanofibers. After treatment
with H2PtCl6 on PTP and TiO2–PTP
nanofibers, the basic febrile morphologies are retained along with
the decoration of Pt NPs on the fibers.

Figure 1 FESEM images of (a,b) TiO2, (c) PTP, (d) TiO2–PTP, (e) Pt–PTP, and (f) Pt–TiO2–PTP.

The decoration of Pt
NPs on PANIs is clearly envisioned by the TEM image studies in Figure 2. The TEM images
of Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP composites
disclose that the Pt NPs are firmly wedged to the PANI surface as
fine NPs. As we discussed earlier, the N centers of PTP can interact
with Pt NPs to uniformly disperse Pt NPs over the PTP and TiO2–PTP polymer fibers. The diameter of the Pt NPs is
∼3 nm, and it remains the same in both the composites (insets
of Figure 2a,f). The
high-resolution fringe lattice image (inset image of Figures 2b and S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information) demonstrates that the
layer distance for the (111) plane of Pt NPs is calculated to be ∼0.223
nm in the Pt–PTP composite, where Pt–TiO2–PTP divulges the lattice fringes of ∼0.37 nm corresponding
to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 along with the characteristic
lattice fringes of Pt ∼0.223 nm (inset image of Figure 2g). The presence of Pt NPs
on PTP fiber is confirmed from the red color (Figure 2d) by the mapping of the image of the selected
area in Figure 2c.
Similarly, TiO2 and Pt NPs are confirmed in the Pt–TiO2–PTP composite by mapping the image of the selected
area in Figure 2h–i.
The simultaneous appearance of red and green dots confirms the presence
of Pt NPs and TiO2, respectively. The elemental mapping
of all elements in both the composites is shown in Figures S1 and
S2 in the Supporting Information. The indexed
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns in Figures S1 and S2 confirm the formation of Pt
NPs in Pt–PTP as the diffraction ring is prominent because
of the (111) plane of Pt. The diffraction ring of the (111) plane
of Pt NPs is merged with the (004) plane of TiO2 in the
SAED pattern of Pt–TiO2–PTP along with the
presence of spots for the (101) plane of TiO2. The energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) study of the Pt–PTP composite divulges the presence
of C, N, O, and Pt (Figure 2e), whereas Pt–TiO2–PTP (Figure 2j) shows extra Ti
along with the aforementioned four elements. The EDX study also evaluates
∼11.00 wt % loading of Pt in the Pt–PTP composite, whereas
the loading density of Ti and Pt in Pt–TiO2–PTP
is found to be 6.38 and 8.50 wt %, respectively.

2.2 Structural and Spectroscopic Studies
The spectroscopic studies of the materials were executed by UV–vis
study, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. In the UV–vis
absorption spectra of perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA)
(Figure 3a), the absorption
maxima is shown at 465 nm along with the other peaks at 433 and 510
nm, which are the characteristic peaks for the perylene core.42 For PANIs (PTP and TiO2–PTP),
along with the characteristic absorption peaks of PTCA, the spectra
exhibit a weak band at 335 nm attributed to the π–π*
transition of the π electrons in the benzenoid rings of PANI
and a broad band at around 640 nm representing the excitation of electrons
from the highest occupied molecular orbital of benzenoid rings to
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of quinoid rings.43 Again, after the formation of Pt NPs on PANIs
in Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP, the 640
nm band of PANI is shifted to a low absorbance broad band at a higher
wavelength of 725 nm because of the π–polaron transition
of the quinoid rings on the PANI chains.44 The decoration of Pt NPs on PANI creates an interaction between
Pt and the nitrogen centers of the PANI chains, which is responsible
for the π–polaron transition.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
spectra, (b) fluorescence
spectra, (c) powdered XRD pattern, and (d) XRF spectra of the compounds.
(c) Corresponding lattice planes of TiO2 and Pt NPs assigned
in the powder XRD plot.

The fluorescence
spectra of PTCA and all the composites are shown in Figure 3b. The perylene-containing
PTCA is only responsible for the emission in all the PANI materials
here. Therefore, we fixed the same amount of PTCA in all composites.
All the composites reveal the emission peaks at 491, 530, and 575
nm, which are the characteristic peaks for the perylene core. However,
the emission intensities of PTCA in the composites have enhanced as
compared to pristine PTCA, possibly because of the reduced aggregation
and isolation of certain perylene cores in PANI chains.42

The XRD patterns of PTCA, PTP, and TiO2–PTP (Figure 3c) in the range of 5–85° show the presence of
PTCA in PANIs along with the incorporation of TiO2 in TiO2–PTP. As evident from Figure 3c, TiO2 in its pristine form,
TiO2–PTP, and Pt–TiO2–PTP
is found to crystallize in a pure-phase anatase structure (I41/amd, JCPDS no. 89-4921).
All the characteristic peaks of TiO2 are assigned to their
corresponding planes in Figure 3c. Again, the presence of Pt NPs in Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP is confirmed by the appearance of four strong
peaks for crystalline Pt NPs in both the samples. Strong crystalline
peaks cantered at 2θ = 40°, 46.2°, 67.7°, and
81.5° correspond to the (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal
planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt NPs.6,45,46 This result suggests that Pt species from
H2PtCl6 are reduced to metallic NPs and embedded
over PANI-supported composites. The intensity of the diffraction peaks
for Pt NPs is quite similar in both the composites as the Pt loading
weight % is somewhat similar in both the composites. The fringe distance
or the distance between two similar crystal planes of Pt NPs has been
calculated from Bragg’s equation. The fringe distances calculated
from Bragg’s equation for the (111) crystal planes of Pt NPs
and the (101) crystal plane of TiO2 are ∼0.225 and
∼0.36 nm, respectively, which are remarkably similar to the
TEM results (inset image of Figures 2b,g and S1).6,47

XRF was performed
to investigate the presence of Pt NPs and TiO2 in the composites.
The XRF spectra shown in Figure 3d confirm the presence of Ti in TiO2–PTP
and Pt–TiO2–PTP as the bands for Ti Kα
and Ti Kβ are fairly present in both the composites. On the
other hand, the existence of Pt in the Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP composites is corroborated as Pt Lα and
Pt Lβ bands are present at 9.2 and 11 keV, respectively.48

Raman spectroscopy was also used to investigate
the synthesized catalysts, and the corresponding plots are shown in Figure S3. It is evidenced from the literature
that the pristine TiO2 shows the most intense band at 145
cm–1 (Eg) and weak bands at 393 (B1g), 505 (A1g), and 626 cm–1 (Eg), owing to the Raman-active modes of the pure anatase phase.32,49 The Raman spectra of TiO2–PTP reveal that the
pristine Eg, B1g, and A1g bands are
red-shifted to 121, 370, 489, and 610 cm–1. Again,
the Eg, B1g, and A1g bands are slightly
blue-shifted to 124, 375, and 515 cm–1, respectively,
after the Pt NP decoration on TiO2-doped PANI because of
the electronic interference from the plasmonic Pt NPs with the excitation
laser wavelength as a result of the strong metal-support electronic
interaction.32 The second Eg band is slightly red-shifted to 602 cm–1, which
might be due to the generation of defects in TiO2 by the
Pt NPs which hamper the Eg-based longitudinal optical phonons.

2.3 Electrocatalytic Oxidation
of Methanol
The electrocatalytic methanol oxidation activities
of the prepared Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP
composites have been studied by the conventional three-electrode system.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the two prepared Pt nanocomposites
recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at a scan speed
of 50 mV S–1 are shown in Figure 4a. Both the voltammograms clearly provide
the evidence about the hydrogen adsorption/desorption on the surface
of Pt NPs at ∼−0.2 to 0.1 V.6,46,50 Alongside this, Pt–PTP shows Pt oxide
formation and oxide reduction on the Pt NP surface at ∼0.48
V in forward scan.6,51,52 The
TiO2-doped composite Pt–TiO2–PTP
reveals the same peak for Pt oxide at ∼0.63 V in forward scan.
The potential Pt oxide reduction is slightly higher in Pt–TiO2–PTP, most likely due to the presence of TiO2 in the composite.

Figure 4 (a) Cyclic voltammograms
of Pt–PTP and
Pt–TiO2–PTP composites in 0.5 M H2SO4 with a scan speed of 50 mV S–1 at
room temperature. (b) CV curves of MOR on Pt–PTP- and Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified GCE in the mixture of 0.5 M methanol
and 0.5 M H2SO4 with a scan speed of 50 mV S–1 at room temperature.

The electrochemical surface area (ECSA),
which is a very significant parameter for the electrochemical performance
of an electrocatalyst, can be calculated by integrating the charge
(QH) passing the electrode during the
hydrogen adsorption/desorption process.6,50 The charge
required to oxidize a hydrogen monolayer is 0.21 mC cm–2. Generally, ECSA is calculated using the following equation6,46,51,53  where “QH”
is the total charge relating to H+ adsorption on an integrated
peak area of hydrogen adsorption/desorption; “mPt” is the active mass of Pt-containing catalyst
(g m–2) on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and
it is 0.157 g m–2 for Pt–PTP and 0.121 g
m–2 for Pt–TiO2–PTP. The
calculated ECSA values for these two composites are ∼24.38
and 41.24 m2 g–1 (Table 1), respectively. The ECSA value for Pt–TiO2–PTP is 1.7 times higher than that of Pt–PTP,
which implies that the catalytic activity of Pt–TiO2–PTP is superior to that of Pt–TiO2 in the
electrochemical process. We can also compare the ECSA values of the
commercially available Pt/C catalyst with similar Pt loading (10%)
in the reported literature under similar CV conditions.6 Mondal et al. reported the ECSA of commercial
Pt/C in 10% Pt-loading catalyst to be ∼14.62 m2 g–1, which is much lower than that of our prepared catalysts
Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP, which have
the ECSA values of ∼24.38 and 41.24 m2 g–1, respectively.6 Hence, we can conclude
that our prepared catalysts are more superior in catalytic activity
than the 10% Pt-loaded commercial Pt/C catalyst.

MOR has been
performed by two Pt NP-containing nanocomposite-modified GCE in 0.5
M H2SO4 electrolyte in the presence of 0.5 M
methanol at 25 °C in the potential range of −0.2 to 1.0
V (vs Ag/AgCl). The cyclic voltammograms during MOR shown in Figure 4b are considerably
different from the voltammetry behaviors shown in Figure 4a.
MOR exhibits two well-defined oxidation peaks at forward and reverse
scans. The first one is at ∼0.74 V in the forward scan and
the second peak is at ∼0.60 V in the backward scan. In a typical
methanol electro-oxidation reaction, the peak current density at the
forward scan (If) denotes the dehydrogenation
of adsorbed methanol to produce Pt-adsorbed carbonaceous species like
CO. This Pt-adsorbed CO can work as a catalyst poison, whereas the
peak current density at the backward scan (Ib) is mainly related with the oxidation of adsorbed carbonaceous
species like CO.6,54 The MOR can be represented by
the following reactions:

In forward scan      

In
reverse scan  

Importantly, the
values of If, Ib, and the ratio of If/Ib are the important parameters which correspond to the
catalytic efficiency and catalyst poisoning. Higher the value of peak
current intensity and the ratio, higher will be the catalytic efficiency.
It is clear from Figure 4b that the methanol oxidation current density of Pt–TiO2–PTP (0.84 mA cm–2) is higher than
that of Pt–PTP (0.31 mA cm–2). Moreover,
the Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst exhibits a slightly
higher If/Ib ratio compared with the Pt–PTP electrocatalyst (2.8 vs 2.58).
This observation implies that the Pt–TiO2–PTP
catalyst is slightly efficient toward MOR than Pt–PTP under
similar conditions owing to the presence of TiO2 in the
nanostructures, which can improve the catalytic activity, as discussed
in Introduction. The If/Ib ratio in the catalysts remains reasonably similar (2.72
and 2.56, respectively, in the two catalysts) even after the 10th
scan (Figure 5a,b),
which implies that the catalyst poisoning is not an issue here and
that the catalysts are very stable during MOR. Furthermore, to investigate
the stability of the Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst,
we performed the study up to 100 cycles, and the If/Ib ratio remained reasonably
similar (2.8 in the 1st scan and 2.71 after the 100th scan) even after
100 scans (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Hence, we can conclude that the Pt–TiO2–PTP
catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic stability for methanol electro-oxidation.
The If/Ib ratio
in our synthesized catalysts is significantly higher than that of
the previously reported Pt– PANI-based catalysts for alcohol
oxidation.6,55−57 As the ratio is higher, the CO-tolerance ability
is also higher in our catalysts compared to the other reported Pt–
PANI composites. Perhaps, the presence of a large perylene core in
the polymer nanostructures and the use of less Pt wt % increase the
vacant space required for the CO liberation as well as make our catalysts
superior with regard to CO poisoning than the previously reported
Pt– PANI -based catalysts for methanol oxidation.

the first
(black line) and 10th (gray line) cycles of MOR for (a) Pt–PTP-
and (b) Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified GCE in the mixture
of 0.5 M methanol and 0.5 M H2SO4 with a scan
speed of 50 mV S–1 at room temperature. (c) CO-stripping
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) study of both the composites in 0.5
M H2SO4 with a scan speed of 50 mV S–1 at room temperature.

To
study the effect of scan rate during MOR, CV was performed during
MOR at various scan rates, and the obtained voltammograms are depicted
in Figure S5a,b. The value of If grows up by increasing the scan rate. The anodic peak
current density (If) versus the square
root of the scan rate in Figure S5c,d in the Supporting Information provides a linear relation in both the cases. From
this linear plot, it can be concluded that the methanol oxidation
on both the modified electrodes is a diffusion-controlled process.58,59

To compare the CO tolerance of the Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP catalysts further, CO-stripping has been measured
(Figure 5c). In the
CO-stripping experiment, the peak at ∼0.85 V has been observed
after feeding the catalyst-modified working electrode with CO gas
externally for 15 min bubbling. Again, a similar peak is vanished
upon purging of argon for 30 min. The obtained peak currents and the
onsets in LSV measurements are more or less similar in both the composites,
which indicate that both the composites are similarly effective for
CO oxidation and CO tolerance.

2.4 Effect of PTP in the Catalyst
To evaluate the effect
of the PANI-containing polymer PTP on the catalyst, we have prepared
Pt–TiO2 with 10 wt % Pt NP loading to compare the
electrochemical properties with the PTP-containing catalysts. We have
characterized the Pt–TiO2 sample by powder XRD,
XRF, FESEM, EDX analysis, and electrochemical characterizations, and
the corresponding results are given in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. The XRD study reveals
the characteristic peaks for anatase TiO2 along with the
distinguishing peaks for Pt NP at 40°, 46.2°, 67.7°,
and 81.5° corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), and (311)
crystal planes of the fcc Pt NPs. The EDX spectra evaluate ∼10
wt %

Pt loading in the Pt–TiO2 sample. The
electrochemical analysis demonstrates that the ECSA value is 32.21
m2 g–1, which is quite lower than that
of Pt–TiO2–PTP. Again, the If/Ib ratio during MOR in acidic
medium is 1.96, which is again quite lower than that of the PTP-containing
polymer nanocomposite catalysts (2.80 for Pt–TiO2–PTP and 2.58 for Pt–PTP). Hence, we can conclude that
PTP has a definite role in homogeneously distributing Pt NPs for enhancing
the ECSA value in the Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst
as we stated earlier in Introduction. Due to the using the high surface
area containing PTP fibers as a conducting support in ternary nanocomposite
catalyst, Pt–TiO2–PTP showing significantly
higher ECSA and If/Ib ratio than previously reported Pt–TiO2 containing
catalyst with reduced graphene oxide as conduction support where the
ECSA is only 0.81 cm2 mg–1 and If/Ib ratio in dark
is 1.93.27 Again, a higher If/Ib ratio during MOR in the Pt–TiO2–PTP and Pt–PTP catalysts demonstrates a higher
CO tolerance in PTP-containing materials, as PTP can interact with
water molecules and assist in the oxidation of CO to CO2 during MOR at room temperature to increase the CO tolerance of the
PTP-containing modified electrode material.

2.5 Photo-Assisted Electrochemical Study
Alongside the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol, a fascinating
phenomenon was observed when the electrocatalytic oxidation was performed
under UV light irradiance. As shown in Figure 6a,b and summarized in Table 1, the catalytic performance toward methanol
oxidation of the Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified GCE
electrodes is considerably improved with the assistance of light illumination
as the current density in forward scan (If) is amplified to 1.15 mA cm–2 (Figure 6b). However, the light illumination
has no effect on the catalytic activity of Pt–PTP as the If value of MOR in the Pt–PTP-modified
electrode is not improved at all after the light illumination. Hence,
compared to Pt–PTP, the catalytic methanol oxidation performance
is improved by 1.3 times with the assistance of UV light. Again, under
light illumination in the Pt–TiO2 catalyst, If is enhanced by ∼2 times (Figure S6g), which is slightly higher than the
1.3 times increment of If in Pt–TiO2–PTP under the same conditions. This higher degree
of If enhancement in Pt–TiO2 may be attributed to the higher wt % of photosensitive TiO2 in Pt–TiO2.

and (b) Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified GCE in the mixture

speed of 50 mV S–1 with and without light irradiation.
(c) UV light effect on chronoamperometric (CA) studies of modified
GCEs during MOR under similar conditions stated earlier.

To further investigate
the light irradiation effects on the two catalysts, the CA measurement
was also performed in the solution of 0.5 M H2SO4 containing 0.5 M CH3OH at a constant potential of 0.74
V. Figure 6c shows
the CA curve from 0 to 4500 s, exposing the electrodes to the light
irradiation in each 500 s interval. Initially, the CA curves exhibit
lowering of current because of the formation of intermediate species
such as Pt catalyst–(CH3OH)ad, Pt catalyst–(CO)ad, Pt catalyst–(OH)ad, and so forth, which
deactivate the Pt surface as well as the oxidation current. After
a while, current deterioration effectively slows down because of the
adsorption/desorption equilibrium of the intermediate species on the
Pt surface. However, when the light irradiation was supplied on the
Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified electrode, the current
density was amplified sharply and again decreased immediately when
the light was turned off. This phenomenon proves that the light treatment
has a positive effect on the MOR process in the Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified electrode. Again, for Pt–PTP,
the increment of the current density after light illumination is negligible.

The improvement of the photoelectrochemical MOR activity of Pt–TiO2–PTP under light irradiation is accredited to the strong
metal–support interaction (SMSI) between the Pt NPs and TiO2 and the light-induced enhancement of charge transport properties
within the Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst. The mechanistic
model of photoinduced electrochemical methanol oxidation is shown
in Figure 7. As described
in Introduction, anatase TiO2 is a kind of n-type semiconductor
with a band gap of 3.2 eV. In TiO2, the movement of the
Fermi level would assist the charge separation because of the SMSI
interaction of the Pt NPs. The positive applied bias and light irradiation
would generate an electron (e–) to photoexcite from
its VB and leave a hole (h+) in the VB. The generated (e–)–h+ pairs participate in the surface
redox reaction to increase the photocurrent under light irradiation.30 Again, the photogenerated h+ can
migrate to the catalyst surface and transform the OH–/H2O species to •OH radicals which are
strong oxidant species to oxidize the species (e.g., CH3OH) adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.25−27,60

Figure 7 Mechanisms
of enhanced methanol oxidation activity for Pt–TiO2–PTP-modified electrode under photo-assisted electrochemical
condition.

The formation
of •OH radicals in our catalytic system can be proved
spectroscopically by the conversion of coumarin to 7-hydroxycoumarin
(umbelliferone) under UV irradiation. In the presence of •OH radicals, coumarin is converted to 7-hydroxycoumarin, which shows
fluorescence at a maximum wavelength of 452 nm. Figure S7 reveals that the emission pattern of coumarin is
entirely changed to produce a broad emission maximum at 452 nm after
UV light irradiation in a mixture of coumarin and Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst. This study confirms the formation of
7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone) via the generation of •OH radicals upon irradiation of UV light in the presence of TiO2-containing catalytic system.

In addition, the reactive •OH radicals could also oxidize the catalyst-adsorbed
CO to suppress the catalyst poisoning. Here, the conducting PANI fibers
play a key role in transporting the e– from the
TiO2 conduction band to the electrode. Again, methanol
may also easily react with the photogenerated h+ to form
methoxy radicals, followed by the electron injection into the conduction
band of TiO2, resulting in the improvement of MOR activity
of the Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst.
The increment of the MOR catalytic activity is lacking in Pt–PTP
because of the absence of photoactive TiO2 in the Pt–PTP
composite. The negligible enhancement of current density in CA measurement
in Pt–PTP under light illumination is probably due to the enhancement
of photocurrent, as perylene-containing PTCA is present in the composite.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized TiO2-containing
PTP and subsequently decorated the nanofibers by Pt NPs. The ternary
composite-modified (Pt–TiO2–PTP) electrode
displays high electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation in
acidic medium than that without its TiO2 counterpart (Pt–PTP),
having similar Pt-loading weight percentage. The calculated ECSA value
for Pt–TiO2–PTP is 1.7 times higher than
that for Pt–PTP, which indicates the superior catalytic activity
of Pt–TiO2–PTP in the electrochemical process.
The ECSA values of our synthesized catalysts are also higher than
that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst at the same Pt-loading
condition. The high If/Ib ratio of the two synthesized catalysts indicates that
the CO tolerance ability is also higher in the Pt–PTP-based
catalyst compared to the other reported Pt– PANI composites.
The catalytic activity of the photoreactive TiO2-containing
catalyst is further improved significantly with the aid of UV light
irradiation. The synergistic effects of photo- and electrocatalysis
on MOR in Pt–TiO2–PTP enhance the MOR catalytic
activity approximately 1.3 times higher in light illumination than
in dark. Hence, this work provides a significant opportunity for developing
a UV light-assisted simple, nimble, and viable strategy for improving
the MOR activity of Pt-based catalysts in DMFCs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Aniline, chloroplatinic
acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6, 6H2O,
≥37.50% Pt basis), perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride,
ammonium persulfate [(NH4)2S2O8] (APS), and titanium(IV) isopropoxide [Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4] were bought from Sigma-Aldrich and were
used as supplied, except aniline which was distilled before use. Methanol
(HPLC Grade) was supplied by S D Fine-Chem Limited. Deionized water
(18 MU cm, Millipore Milli-Q water) was used to prepare solutions
where necessary.

4.2 Synthesis of TiO2
TiO2 was synthesized
from the starting material TiO(NO3)2 by an instantaneous
single step, the solution combustion route. TiO(NO3)2 was initially prepared by hydrolyzing Ti{OCH(CH3)2}4, followed by dissolving it in a least
quantity of concentrated nitric acid. Colorimetric method was employed
for the evaluation of the Ti ion concentration in TiO(NO3)2 solution. The fuel glycine was mixed with TiO(NO3)2 in a 1:1.11 ratio to stoichiometrically balance
the oxidizing/reducing valencies of the oxidizer and the fuel according
to the propellant chemistry. In a 300 mL borosilicate dish, 1 g of
TiO(NO3)2 and 0.442 g of glycine were mixed
together, and the dish was kept in a preheated muffle furnace at 450
°C to yield the voluminous and fluffy TiO2.

4.3 Synthesis of PTCA
PTCA was synthesized according to the reported procedure.42 Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride
(0.20 g, 0.5 mmol) was solubilized in 10 mL of 5% KOH solution in
water by nonstop stirring at 70 °C. After cooling the solution
to room temperature, 0.1 M HCl was added drop by drop with continuous
stirring till the pH reached 5–6. The product was collected
by filtrating the precipitation and consequently drying in vacuum
overnight to provide 0.18 g of PTCA as a red powder (yield of 91%).

1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6, room temperature): 8.60–8.64 (d, 4H), 8.04–8.06 (d,
4H).

MASS: (MALDI-TOF): found 430.21 [(M + H)+].

FTIR: γC=O stretch (1692 cm–1), O–H
bends (1504 cm–1), C–O stretch (1298 cm–1), and O–H stretch (2990 cm–1); C=C (perylene core) 1591 cm–1; C–H
(perylene core) 803 and 729 cm–1.

4.4 Preparation of PTP
PTP
was synthesized according to the reported procedure.42 PTCA (48 mg, 0.11 mmol) was taken in 20 mL of water to
solubilize with continuous stirring for 2 h at 25 °C. Aniline
(102 mg, 100 mL, 1.1 mmol) was taken into the PTCA solution and stirred
for another 1 h at the same temperature. The mixture was ice-cooled,
and aqueous APS solution (50 mg in 10 mL) was added dropwise to the
mixture at 5 °C, and after addition it was kept at 5 °C
temperature for another 24 h without stirring. The precipitate was
filtered and washed alternatively with water and methanol to eliminate
the oligomers and excess APS. Finally, it was dried under vacuum at
room temperature for 24 h to obtain PTP (102 mg) as a greenish black
powder.

4.5 Preparation
of TiO2-Containing PTP
TiO2–PTP
was prepared by the abovementioned procedure used for the synthesis
of PTP. To the PTCA (48 mg, 0.11 mmol) solution in 20 mL water, aniline
(102 mg, 100 mL, 1.1 mmol) and the prepared TiO2 (20 mg)
was mixed together and stirred for 1 h. The mixture was polymerized
by APS by the abovementioned procedure to provide 118 mg of TiO2–PTP as a greenish black powder.

4.6 Preparation of the Pt–PTP
and Pt–TiO2–PTP Catalysts
Pt–PTP
and Pt–TiO2–PTP catalysts were synthesized
from their corresponding PANI nanofiber precursors PTP and TiO2–PTP. In a typical process, 10 mg of PTP or TiO2–PTP polymer was dispersed in 10 mL of water. A 5 mL
of H2PtCl6 solution (2 mg mL–1) was added dropwise with continuous stirring. NaBH4 (5
mg) was used as the reducing agent and stirred for 6 h at 25 °C.
The synthesized Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP
composites were precipitated by centrifugation at 5000 rpm and washed
with water for five times. Drying the materials in vacuum provided
12.5 mg and 13.1 mg Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP,
respectively, as black powders.

4.7 General Characterization
The UV–vis spectra
of the compounds were studied using a JASCO/V-650 (190–900
nm) UV–vis spectrophotometer, taking the dimethylformamide
solution of the compounds. Fluorescence studies were done in a JASCO/FP-6300
(190–900 nm) fluorescence spectrometer. Powder XRD was studied
with Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5418 Å). A typical scan was performed at a scan
rate of 1° min–1 with a step size of 0.02°.
High-resolution TEM, EDX analysis, and bright-field imaging and mapping
of Pt–PTP and Pt–TiO2–PTP were performed
on a UHR-FEG-TEM (JEOL, JEM 2100) instrument at 200 kV. Water dispersions
of the samples were casted on a 200-mesh Cu-grid for TEM. FESEM imaging
and EDX analysis were performed by FEI, Apreo S with a 20 kV operating
voltage by taking a small amount of methanol-dispersed sample drop
casted on a silicon wafer. The loading of Pt in the synthesized catalysts
was monitored by energy-dispersive XRF (Epsilon 1; PANalytical). The
Raman spectra were recorded by a UniRAM 3300 Raman microscope with
a laser wavelength of 532 nm.

4.8 Electrochemical Characterization
All electrochemical
experiments like CV and CA were executed by an Autolab potentiostat
PGSTAT128N using a three-electrode system. The electrodes were Pt–PTP
and Pt–TiO2–PTP catalyst-modified GCE-based
working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode. The GCE, 3 mm in diameter, was polished gently with 1,
0.3, and 0.05 mm alumina powder, and a mirror-finish GCE was obtained
after washing. A 5 μL solution of methanol-dispersed Pt–PTP
and Pt–TiO2–PTP composites (2 mg mL–1) were drop-casted over on active surface of GCE and dried to make
a film for electrochemical study. The methanol electro-oxidation was
recorded in a mixture of 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.5
M methanol.

4.9 Photo-Assisted
Electrochemical Characterization
The photo-assisted methanol
electro-oxidation was studied under UV light irradiation using a medium-pressure
mercury vapor lamp (365 nm) of 125 W. The average energy of the illuminated
light was 3.5 eV with a photon flux of 5.86 × 10–6 mol photons/s. Water was circulated around the lamp to keep the
reaction at room temperature and to cease the IR emission from the
lamp. In the photo-assisted condition, the electrochemical measurements
were done by the abovementioned process. The formation of the •OH radicals was confirmed by the coumarin study. In
a typical procedure, 5 mg of the Pt–TiO2–PTP
catalyst was added to a 3.5 mL of 0.03 mM coumarin solution in a quartz
cuvette and UV light-irradiated for 120 min. After UV light irradiation,
500 mg of KCl was added to the suspension and kept in dark for 12
h to get a clear solution, and the emission spectra were studied.
The emission spectra of the formed 7-hydroxycoumarin (umbelliferone)
were measured at an excitation wavelength of 332 nm.
