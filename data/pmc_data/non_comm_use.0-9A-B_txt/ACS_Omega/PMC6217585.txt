The integration of therapy and diagnostics,
termed “theranostics”,
has recently gained widespread utility in the development of new and
improved therapeutics that effectively diagnose and treat diseases,
such as cancer. In this study, the covalent attachment of multiple
fluorescent labels (i.e., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)) to a
wide range of siRNAs, including those adopting linear, V- and Y-shape
nanostructures, was successfully accomplished by solid-phase bioconjugation
for monitoring cell uptake, co-localization, and biological activity
in cell culture. The FITC-labeled higher-order V- and Y-shape siRNAs
maintained the requisite hybrid stabilities and A-type helical structures
for invoking RNAi activity. The FITC–siRNA hybrids with sense-strand
modifiers enabled efficient mRNA knockdown (∼50–90%),
which also translated to increased cell death (∼20–95%)
in a bone metastatic prostate cancer cell line, over a 72 h incubation
period. Significantly, the Y-shaped siRNA containing three FITC probes
enhanced fluorescent signaling relative to the siRNA constructs containing
single and double fluorophores while retaining potent knockdown and
cell death effects post-transfection. Taken together, this data highlights
the theranostic utility of the multilabeled FITC–siRNA constructs
for potential cancer gene therapy applications.

Introduction
Gene therapy has re-emerged
as a promising precision medicine strategy
for the targeted treatment of cancer. At the forefront of this therapeutic
application are short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that have silenced
oncogenic mRNA expression leading to cancer cell death through the
RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism.1,2 Therapeutic
siRNAs have been extensively tested in preclinical studies, and some
have already entered clinical trials for the treatment of cancer and
several other diseases.3,4 Consummately, the first Food and
Drug Administration-approved siRNA drug Onpattro (patisiran) is set
to hit the open market for adult clinical treatment of hereditary
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.5

The integration of therapy and diagnostics “theranostics”
has gained significant traction in the development of new and improved
gene therapeutics for the diagnosis and treatment of cancers.6 More specifically, siRNA bioconjugates containing
reporter probes, such as fluorophores, near-infrared (near IR) dyes
and photosensitizers as well as those containing contrast agents and
radiolabels, have been extensively applied as theranostic agents in
oncology to selectively detect and treat malignant tumors at their
localized sites in a preventative precision medicine strategy.7,8 Synthetic approaches for theranostic siRNA development have been
mostly focused on tagging the delivery vehicles and targeting ligands8−12 as well as direct siRNA labeling to track cell uptake, co-localization,
and RNAi activity in cancer cells.13−16 Taken together, these selected
examples serve to highlight the potential applications of theranostic
siRNA formulations that have enabled detection and treatment in difficult
to treat tumor cells, both in vitro and in vivo by selectively targeting
and silencing oncogenic mRNA expression. Conventional linear siRNAs
are typically limited by a single-site fluorophore incorporation at
the 3′ or 5′ terminus by conventional solid-phase RNA
synthesis. This incorporation hinders the efficiency and duration
of fluorescence emission due to inevitable quenching, photobleaching,
decomposition, and leaching of the bound fluorophore. Therefore, potentially
incorporating multiple fluorescent (FL) probes within single, higher-order
RNA molecular scaffolds provides the opportunity to enhance detection
and visualization of RNA activity in cancer cells and tumor-bearing
animal models. The latter is a primary goal in the development of
an effective siRNA-based theranostic approach.

Toward this objective,
we have previously reported the synthesis,
characterization, and RNAi evaluation of higher-order branch and hyperbranch
siRNAs.17 Significantly, these constructs
targeted multiple mRNA sites belonging to the glucose-regulated protein
of 78 kDa (GRP 78) and triggered more potent silencing (50–60%)
and cell death (5–20%) in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells
relative to their linear controls. Moreover, the V- and Y-shape RNAs
served as templates for the self-assembly of siRNA nanostructures
into genetically encoded shapes targeting, GRP 75, GRP 78, and GRP
94 in endometrial, cervical, and breast cancers.18 These unique siRNA nanostructures were found to elicit
synergistic anticancer effects while enabling screening for the influence
of the GRPs on cancer cell biology. The GRP-silencing siRNAs revealed
a stronger addiction of tumor cells to GRP overexpression and proliferation
when compared to a nontumorigenic control cell line, which displayed
normal GRP expression levels. These results underscored the GRP dependence
of cancer cells, which provided insights on tumor treatment specificity.

The GRPs are chaperone proteins that serve as main sensors for
misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trigger the
unfolded protein response (UPR) under physiological and pathological
cellular stress conditions.19 As chaperones,
GRPs own subcellular localization in the ER where
they chaperone protein folding activity, in the mitochondria where
they interact with pro-apoptotic and survival executors and at the
cell surface where they direct cell signaling.19 In cancer, the GRPs are overexpressed and in certain tumors,
cell surface localized where they function as signaling receptors
for oncogenic activity.20 GRP knockdown
or inhibition has been shown to sensitize cancer cells for treatment,
trigger tumor cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis resulting in potent
anticancer effects.21−24 Thus, the GRPs have been validated as clinically relevant molecular
targets in cancer.19

In this study,
the design, synthesis, characterization, and biological
evaluation of a wide range of GRP-silencing siRNAs are reported. These
include the siRNAs adopting linear, V-shape, and Y-branch structures
that enabled the incorporation of multiple fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) reporter probes for enhanced monitoring of cell uptake, co-localization,
and biological activity within PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

Results
and Discussion
FITC Labeling of RNA Templates
The
siRNA sequences
described in this study (see Supporting Information, Table S1) are based on the target nucleotides for downregulating
GRP 75, 78, and 94 expression in human cancer cells.25 The linear, V-, and Y-shaped RNA templates targeting GRP
75, 78, and 94 mRNA were synthesized by automated solid-phase RNA
synthesis following our previously reported procedure.17,18 Briefly, an orthogonally protected 5′-OLv 2′-OMMT
ribouridine phosphoramidite was used as branchpoint synthon to selectively
extend the linear RNA sequence on solid phase into the desired V-
and Y-shape RNA templates. Following solid-phase RNA synthesis, a
5′-DMS(O)-MT-amino C6 modifier (Glen Research Inc.) was coupled
to the 5′-terminal, which upon detritylation produced a free
amino group for bioconjugation. The amine-functionalized RNA templates
were then subjected to solid-phase conjugation for the covalent attachment
of FITC following a previously reported procedure (Scheme 1).26

Scheme 1 Solid-Phase FITC Bioconjugation of Linear, V-, and Y-Shape RNA Templates
Reverse-phase ion pairing high-performance
liquid chromatography
(RP-IP HPLC) analysis of the crude reaction mixture following cleavage
and deprotection from the solid support indicated good conversions
in the case of both the linear (∼60%) and V-shaped FITC–RNA
(∼40%). However, conversion to the Y-shaped FITC–RNA
was not observed. To address this limitation, conjugation of FITC
to the corresponding complementary linear sense strands was achieved
as described above and isolated following HPLC purification in high
yields and purities >95%, followed by hybridization with the Y-shape
RNA template. The sense-strand FITC-labeled linear RNA strands were
also hybridized with the corresponding linear and V-shape RNA templates
allowing for a direct comparison of FITC modification on the sense
vs antisense RNA strands. The latter has been found to trigger profound
effects on siRNA silencing activity.27 Moreover,
hybridization of the linear FITC-labeled sense RNA strands to the
linear, V-shape, and Y-shape RNA templates allowed for the incorporation
of single, double, and triple fluorescent probes, respectively, within
the higher-order, self-assembled siRNA bioconjugates (Scheme 2). All FITC-labeled RNA templates
were isolated in ≥95% purities, and their identities were confirmed
by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS); see Table S1, Supporting Information.

The green label represents fluorescent

Antisense
(A) and sense (S) strands were hybridized to target a first (1) or
second (2) mRNA site belonging to GRP 75, 78, and 94.

Characterization of FITC-Labeled siRNAs
The purified
RNA templates and their complementary RNA single strands were hybridized
in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA); pH 7.5–8.0, 35 μL) using equimole amounts
(200 pmol) of the complementary strands. siRNA hybridization was confirmed
by a native, nondenaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE). In this assay (Figure 1A), the lower-molecular-weight linear siRNA hybrids migrated
fastest on the gel (lanes 1 and 2), whereas the V- and Y-shaped RNA
templates hybridized to their complementary RNA single strands (Figure 1A, lanes 4–9
and lanes 10–13, respectively) were more retained. Long-wave
UV shadowing revealed the FITC-labeled siRNA hybrids (Figure 1B, lanes 2, 5–6, 8–9,
and 11–13). Native PAGE analysis of multi-FITC–siRNA
samples also confirmed successful hybridization, (Figure 1C). In this assay, the lower-molecular-weight
linear siRNA hybrids (lanes 3 and 4) once more migrated fastest on
the gel, whereas the V- and Y-shaped RNA templates hybridized to their
complementary RNA single strands, which contained the FITC labels
(Figure 1C, lanes 7–8
and lanes 11–13, respectively), were more retained on the gel.
Long-wave UV shadowing revealed the bright multi-FITC-labeled V- and
Y-shape siRNA hybrids containing double and triple fluorescent probes,
respectively (Figure 1D, lanes, 8 and 13).

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
was then used to determine
whether the siRNA hybrid structures maintained the prerequisite A-type
helix geometry for RNAi applications.28 The linear siRNAs displayed typical CD profiles for A-form helices,
with a minimum peak at 240 nm and a broad maximum in between 250 and
290 nm.29 In all cases, the linear, V-,
and Y-shaped FITC–siRNA hybrids (Figure 2A) retained the A-type broad maximum and
minimum bands, which were observed between 250–290 and 240
nm, respectively, albeit with a decrease in the amplitudes of the
molar ellipticities at these characteristic wavelengths. The multi-FITC-labeled
siRNAs (Figure 2B)
produced more pronounced deviations from the A-type RNA helix. In
most cases, the maximum peak at 260 nm remained, however, with notable
changes in molar ellipticities at the characteristic maxima and minima
within the 210–250 nm range. Therefore, it can be suggested
that the FITC labels produce distortions in the A-type helix geometry
of the siRNA, with more pronounced effects observed with the multi-FITC-labeled
V- and Y-shape siRNA hybrids. Their effect on hybrid stability, fluorescence
emission, and biological activity was subsequently examined.

All siRNA hybrids were prepared in annealing buffer (1.25 μM,
10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0).

Stability of the FITC–siRNA hybrids was
measured by thermal
denaturation (Tm). The addition of the
FITC probe at the 5′ terminus of the antisense strand had little
to no effect on hybrid stability (Figure 2C). For example, the linear FITC-GRP78A1:S1
maintained similar hybrid stabilities (Tm: 63 °C) relative to the native A1:S1 (Tm: 62 °C) siRNAs. Likewise, the V-shaped FITC-V-78A194A1:78S194S1
(Tm: 58 → 60 °C) and FITC-V-78A178A2:78S178S2
(Tm: 55 → 62 °C) showed a
slight increase in thermal hybrid stabilities. The Y-shaped hybrids
elicited a weaker hybrid stability, (Tm: 52 °C), however, as seen previously, incorporation of the
FITC label had little to no effect on siRNA hybrid thermal stability.
In the case of the multi-FITC–siRNAs (Figure 2D), the V-shape RNA template hybridized with
two FITC-linear RNAs showed an increase in hybrid stability (Tm: 58 → 65 °C), whereas the Y-shape
hybridized with three FITC-linear RNAs exhibited a more significant
increase in hybrid stability (Tm: 52 →
68 °C). Taken together, the FITC labels promote little changes
with a single incorporation to more significant increases in siRNA
hybrid stability with the incorporation of multiple FITCs, suggesting
a stabilizing effect, potentially due to π-stacking and n →
π* interactions with adjacent nucleobases on the oligonucleotide
strands.30,31

Spectrofluorimetry was used to determine
whether the siRNA hybrids
had any effect on fluorescence emission intensities and quantum yields
of the FITC probe. Previous studies on fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides
have illustrated that covalent conjugation decreases fluorescence
efficiency.30 Upon conjugation of FITC
with the siRNA sequences, a blue shift (485–445 nm) was observed.31 UV absorption studies revealed an observed FITC
absorption peak at around 460 nm (see Supporting Information, Figure S20). Upon excitation (λex: 460 nm), the emission spectrum was monitored (λem: 470–650 nm) for the fluorescent FL–siRNA hybrids
(Figure 2E). Interestingly,
the linear FITC-78A1:S1 sample produced comparable fluorescence quantum
yields (ϕ = 1.0), as the FITC fluorescent probe alone (ϕ
= 0.93). Furthermore, a notable red shift in the fluorescence emission
maxima, λem: 515–520 nm, was observed for
the FL–siRNAs vs FITC alone. The two V- (ϕ = 0.28, 0.14)
and single Y-shaped (ϕ = 0.15) FITC-labeled siRNA samples displayed
significant quenching (70–85%) when compared to the linear
FL–siRNA and the FITC control, as also described in the literature.31 The latter may be presumably due to the nature
of the extended sequence composition and higher-order structures of
the V- and Y-shape siRNAs, which effect FITC fluorescence efficiency
when compared to the linear FITC-labeled siRNA hybrid duplex. In an
attempt to overcome this limitation, multiple FITC-labeled complementary
sense-strand RNAs were hybridized to the antisense V- and Y-shape
RNA templates (Scheme 2). The fluorescence emission spectra of the multi-FITC-labeled V-
and Y-shape siRNAs, which incorporated two and three FITC fluorescent
probes, respectively, were found to increase fluorescence emission
intensity (Figure 2E,F) although with still observable quenching effects (V-2 FL-S1
ϕ = 0.17, Y-3 FL-S1 ϕ = 0.24) when compared with the siRNAs
with the incorporation of a single FITC probe (FL-S1 ϕ = 0.66)
(Figure 2E). In spite
of the quenching effects, the higher-order V- and Y-shape siRNAs,
which enabled the incorporation of multiple FITC reporter probes,
produced greater intensities of fluorescence emissions when compared
to the siRNAs containing a single FITC probe. The latter may be useful
in potentiating cell signaling to track siRNA biological activity
in live cells.

Cell Uptake and Intracellular Localization
of FITC–siRNAs
The PC-3 prostate cancer cell line
(ATCC CRL-1435) was used to
determine the knockdown efficiency of the FITC-labeled siRNA constructs.32 Uptake and internalization efficiency of the
FITC–siRNA sequences were determined by flow cytometry. The
fluorescence intensities of the linear, V-, and Y-shaped FITC-labeled
siRNAs compared to control siRNA were initially investigated (Figure 3A). Of note, V and
Y-shaped siRNA signals showed a decrease in the percentage of total
gated cells suggesting that these configurations may experience quenching
of the FITC fluorescence over time. Interestingly, the multi-FITC–siRNA
signaling increased over time (Figure 3B, 4–72 h) when compared to the FITC-labeled
siRNAs containing single fluorophores (Figure 3A,B). Thus, the multi-FITC–siRNAs
were found to overcome the apparent quenching effects observed in
the V- and Y-shape siRNAs containing a single fluorophore. These trends
were also observed in the spectrofluorimetry studies (Figure 2E,F). High content screening
was also used to visualize the internalization of the FITC–siRNAs
within PC-3 cells up to 24 h post-transfection (Figure 4).

GRP Knockdown and Cell
Death Effects of FITC–siRNAs
siRNA transfections (10
μM) were conducted with the TransIT-X2
Dynamic Delivery System transfection reagent within the PC-3 cell
culture and incubated for 72 h. Reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) indicated that upon GRP 78 mRNA knockdown, a marked
upregulation of GRP 94 expression was observed, with a lower effect
on the GRP 75 mRNA levels (Figure 5A). Presumably, this compensatory effect may be linked
to the maintenance of the UPR under the stress-induced conditions,
potentially linking the activity of these GRP chaperones.25 A similar trend was observed for the V-shaped
siRNA targeting GRP 78 and 94 mRNA, with a noticeable upregulation
of GRP 75, albeit to a smaller extent (Figure 5A). The Y-shaped siRNA targeting all three
GRP chaperone proteins displayed the most synergistic mRNA knockdown
(40–70%) of GRP 75, 78, and 94 (Figure 5A). Comparison with the FITC-labeled siRNA
constructs demonstrated GRP knockdown (20–70%) in a sequence-dependent
manner albeit to a lesser extent when compared to the native, unconjugated
siRNAs (40–80%) (Figure 5A). The decrease in GRP-silencing activity of the FL-labeled
siRNAs can be partially attributed to detrimental effects of functionalizing
the 5′ terminus of the antisense siRNA strand, which may inhibit
incorporation into RNA induced silencing complex and mRNA processing
as part of the RNAi pathway.27 Interestingly,
when the sense strands were FITC-labeled and hybridized to the complementary
Y-shaped RNA template, the FITC-labeled Y-shape siRNA displayed comparable
GRP knockdown (55–95%), as the non-FITC-labeled Y-shape siRNAs
(40–80%) (Figure 5B). Thus, FITC functionalization of the sense-strand was found to
restore siRNA activity.

78, and 94. (A) Total
mRNA levels were analyzed 72 h post-transfection of the antisense-labeled
FL–siRNA constructs. (B) Total mRNA levels were analyzed 48

containing 1, 2, and 3 FITC probes. Protein and mRNA knockdown levels
of GRP 75, 78, and 94 determined by Western blot (C) and RT-PCR (D)
with the Y-shape FL–siRNA containing three FITC probes. *P < 0.05 and *P < 0.01 in PC-3 cells.

Following qRT-PCR screening, the
lead Y-shaped siRNA containing
three FITC probes was selected for further analysis. The Y-shaped
siRNA sample (50 nM) was prepared and transfected into PC-3 cells
as described earlier. Cells were collected 72 h post-transfection
and subjected to qRT-PCR and Western blot. RT-PCR (Figure 5D) showed mRNA knockdown of
GRP 78 (∼40%), increased knockdown of GRP 94 (∼60%)
without noticeable effects on GRP 75. However, Western blot indicated
protein level knockdown of GRP 75 and 78 (∼30–35%) in
both instances, but no visible knockdown of GRP 94, which is known
to vary from the mRNA transcript levels during UPR stress (Figure 5C).33

Cell viability of the FITC-labeled siRNAs treated
PC-3 cells was
measured using propidium iodide (PI) staining. PI is a fluorescent
intercalating agent that stains dead cells and is commonly used in
flow cytometry to evaluate cell viability. PI cannot cross the membrane
of live cells, making it useful to differentiate necrotic, apoptotic,
and healthy cells.34 PC-3 cell viability
was determined at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection to determine
which construct exhibited the most potent cell death activity (see
Supporting Information, Figure S25). Following
24 h incubation, it was noted that the supernatant contained PC-3
cells as an initial indicator of cell death due to loss in adhesion.
Both the supernatant cells as well as the cells still adhered to the
bottom of the well were tested for viability. PI staining showed an
increase in cell death over a 72 h period for all samples. The Y-shape
siRNA targeting all three GRPs elicited the most potent cell death
in both cases.

Conclusions
In this study, the covalent
attachment of FITC to a wide range
of GRP-silencing siRNAs, including those adopting linear, V-, and
Y-shape structures, allowed the incorporation of multiple FITC reporter
probes for monitoring cellular uptake. Although FITC labeling had
some effect on the requisite A-type helix structure required for RNAi
activity, the fluorescent probe did not inhibit hybrid duplex stability
according to thermal denaturation studies. The higher-order V- and
Y-shape siRNAs, which enabled the incorporation of multiple FITC reporter
probes, displayed fluorescence quenching, albeit with greater intensities
of fluorescence emissions when compared to the siRNAs containing a
single FITC. Upon transfection in the PC-3 prostate cancer cells,
the FITC-labeled siRNAs triggered GRP mRNA and protein knockdown,
which resulted in loss of PC-3 cell adhesion and induced cell death.
Flow cytometry and high content screening also revealed the presence
of the FITC-labeled siRNA within PC-3 cells up to 72 h. Therefore,
the V- and Y-shape multi-FITC-labeled siRNAs encompass a new class
of theranostic agents with enhanced cell-based detection and RNAi
activity in cancer cells.

or Glen Research Inc. and also used without further purification.
Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum-backed
silica gel plates (Merck 60 F254). TLCs were visualized under UV shadowing
(260 nm) or staining (10% H2SO4/MeOH). Compound
purification using silica gel chromatography was performed on 230–400
mesh silica (Sorbent Technologies). Molecular weights for the branchpoint
uridine phosphoramidite were measured by direct injections on a Hewlett
Packard series 1100 MSD equipped with ESI as ion source in positive
mode using 50:50 v/v MeOH/H2O at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
NMR spectra (1H, 13C, 31P correlation
spectroscopy NMR) were recorded on an OXFORD NMR AS500 spectrophotometer.
NMR spectra were obtained at ambient temperature using an indirect
pulse-field gradient probe. The obtained data were processed using
VNMRJ software (version 2.2). Materials for cell biology were obtained
from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cell Signaling, Biolegend, Mirus and
Invitrogen Life Technologies and used as received according to the
manufacture’s protocol.

FITC Bioconjugation of
Linear, V-, and Y-Shape RNA Templates
Linear, V-, and Y-shaped
siRNAs were selected to target the GRP
chaperones (GRP 75, 78, and 94), and the requisite RNA templates were
synthesized as previously reported.17,18 Following
synthesis, a 5′-DMS(O)-MT-Amino C6 modifier (Glen Research
Inc.) was coupled to the 5′ terminal hydroxyl group using an
extended 15 min coupling time on an ABI 3400 DNA/RNA synthesizer.
The amino-functionalized RNA templates were then subjected to a solid-phase
bioconjugation reaction for the attachment of the fluorescent probe,
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Following a previously reported
method,26 attachment of FITC was achieved
by reacting FITC (75 equiv, 30 mg) dissolved in 20% aqueous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in 0.1 M carbonate–bicarbonate
buffer (pH 8.5) to the amino-modified RNA templates. The reaction
was agitated at room temperature (RT) for 48 h on a benchtop shaker.
Following the reaction, the CPG-bound RNA was washed with DMF and
acetonitrile (MeCN) until no visible orange color remained in the
supernatant. The sample was then cleaved and deprotected using 3:1
v/v NH4OH/EtOH at 55 °C for 12–14 h. The 2′-TBDMS
protecting groups were desilylated using 1:1.5 v/v trimethylamine–trihydrofluoride
TEA-3HF/DMSO at 65 °C for 2 h. The crude FL–RNA templates
were precipitated in 3 M NaOAc (25 μL) and n-BuOH (1 mL) and dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated Millipore
water, RNase-free, for analysis and purification.

Reverse-Phase
Ion Paring High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(RP-IP HPLC)
The crude RNA templates were analyzed by reverse-phase
ion pairing high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-IP-HPLC) to
determine crude purities. Briefly, HPLC analyses (0.1 OD) and purifications
(1 OD) were performed on a Waters 2695 Alliance Separations Module.
Crude RNA templates were dissolved in autoclaved water (1 mL) and
injected into a Waters SymmetryShield RP-8 column (4.6 × 250
mm2, 5 μm particle size, 100 Å) heated at 60
°C. HPLC analyses and purifications were conducted using a gradient
of 4–90% eluent B (50% acetonitrile in 0.1 M triethylammnonium
acetate, TEAA) in eluent A (0.1 M TEAA). The HPLC flow rate was set
at 1 mL/min, with run times of 25 min and with dual absorbance detection
at 260 and 488 nm using a Waters 2489 UV/visible detector. Retention
times (min) and peak areas (% area) were integrated with Empower II
software (Waters) and used to confirm RNA purities ≥95% following
sample purifications.

Mass Spectrometry
RNA templates
(300–1300 pmol)
were dissolved in RNase-free Millipore water (50–200 μL)
and analyzed by Dr. Mark Hail and Kevin McCarl at Novatia LLC, Newtown,
PA. Samples were analyzed on an Oligo HTCS equipped ESI/MS in negative
mode. The data were obtained and deconvoluted using ProMass software.
Theoretical molecular weights were calculated by entering each sequence
identity using Oligo II mass calculator version 1.0 http://mods.rna.albany.edu/masspec/Oligo-II.

siRNA Hybridization
Purified complementary antisense
and sense RNA strands were combined in equimole quantities (200 pmol)
and mixed in annealing buffer (35 μL, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0) to afford the hybrid mixtures. The resulting
mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 7 min on a heating block, slowly
cooled to room temperature over 1 h, and stored in the fridge overnight
at 4 °C prior to analysis.

Nondenaturing, Native Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)
The hybrid siRNA samples (10 μM)
in annealing buffer (10
mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0) were concentrated
to minimal volume (∼10 μL) and suspended in 30% sucrose
loading buffer (15 μL in 1× TBE). Samples were loaded on
a 16% native, nondenaturing PAGE and run at 300 V, 100 mA, and 12
W for 2.5 h. Following electrophoresis, the siRNA bands were visualized
under UV shadowing and stained with Stains-All (Sigma-Aldrich) solution.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
siRNA samples
were hybridized in annealing buffer (1.25 μM, 10 mM Tris, 50
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0), as previously described. Samples
were then transferred to fused quartz cells (1 cm path length) and
incubated at room temperature (RT) under N2 for 2 min prior
to spectral acquisition. CD spectra were collected on an Olis DSM
1000 Spectrophotometer as an average of three scans with a 1.0 nm
bandwidth interval and a 0.5 nm step interval. CD spectra were analyzed
in between 210 and 310 nm, blank corrected with annealing buffer,
and smoothed prior to analyses. The raw data were exported into Microsoft
Excel and plotted as changes in molar ellipticities (θ) with
increasing wavelengths (210–310 nm).

Thermal Denaturation (Tm)
All siRNA hybrids were prepared,
as previously described in annealing
buffer (1.25 μM, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0).
Thermal denaturation of the siRNA hybrids was performed using a CARY
3E, UV–vis spectrophotometer, from 20 to 80 °C, with temperature
ramping of 0.5 °C/min. The changes in absorption at 260 nm as
a function of temperature were collected, and the first derivative
plot was used to determine the melting temperatures (Tm) of the siRNA samples. The data were transferred and
plotted in Microsoft Excel as changes in the hyperchromicities (% H) observed at 260 nm as a function of temperature (20–80
°C).

Fluorescence Emission and Quantum Yield (ϕ) Determination
All siRNA hybrids were prepared as previously described in annealing
buffer (1.25 μM, 10 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5–8.0).
UV absorbance measurements on a HP 8452A PDA spectrophotometer were
initially conducted to determine FL–siRNA absorbances at the
wavelengths of excitation, λex: 460 nm and λem: 486 nm. Absorbance readings within the 0.1–0.01
au range were recovered from serial dilution measurements necessary
for accurate fluorescence emission measurements. Fluorescence emission
and quantum yields were determined on a Horiba Fluorolog spectrophotometer
using FluorEssence V3.5 with an excitation of λex: 460 nm and emission window λem: of 470–650
nm.

Cell Culture
The PC-3 (ATCC CRL-1435) prostate cancer
cell line was cultured in RPMI-1640 complete growth medium supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin
(P/S) under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For passaging, PC-3 cells
were detached with 0.25% trypsin and resuspended with complete culture
medium.

siRNA Transfections of PC-3 Cells
PC-3 cells were cultured
in RPMI-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified
incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfection,
9.0 × 104 cells were plated in 24-well culture plates
until 70–80% confluent. The siRNA hybrids (7.5 μL, 10
μM, in Opti-MEM, 133.5 μL) were mixed with the transfection
reagent (TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System, 9 μL, in Opti-MEM,
250 μL) according to the manufacture’s recommendation.
The mixtures were incubated (15 min, at room temperature), added to
the PC-3 cultures, and incubated for 72 h. To determine internalization
efficiency of the siRNAs, samples were tested by flow cytometry and
fluorescence microscopy.

Flow Cytometry
At selected time
points, PC-3 cells
were trypsinized and resuspended in RPMI-1640 complete media. Samples
were quantified using an FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).
Cells were analyzed 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection. Data
were analyzed using Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter).

High Content
Screen for Microscopic Evaluation
Time-dependent
cell uptake for linear, V-, and Y-shaped siRNAs containing one, two,
and three FITC probes was determined using CellInsight CX5 High Content
Screening (HCS) Platform (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were visualized
2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection. Images were analyzed
using Thermo Scientific HCS Studio Cell Analysis software.

Quantitative
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)
Total mRNA
was isolated following transfections (48 h) from TriZol
(Ambion)-preserved cells using a TriRNA Pure Kit (Geneaid), following
the manufacturer’s instructions. The collected mRNA was then
quantitated on a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter using the Qubit Broad Range
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). mRNA (200 ng) was reversed transcribed
into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR
was performed using predeveloped TaqMan gene expression primer probes
for GRP 78 (assay ID Hs99999174_m1), GRP 94 (assay ID Hs00437665_g1),
GRP 75 (Hs00269818_m1), and GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1) and TaqMan fast
advanced master mix. qPCR fast assay was carried out on a StepOnePlus
(Applied Biosystems). Fold changes were calculated with the ΔΔCt method using GAPDH as endogenous control and
the negative siRNA as the control sample.

Western Blot
Total
protein was isolated from the cell
lysates following transfection (72 h). Protein samples were prepared
by lysing the cells in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(G-Biosciences) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Millipore Sigma), which were diluted 1:10 as per the manufacturer’s
recommendations. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16 000g at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined
using a PierceTM BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A sample (20–35
mg) of the supernatant protein was mixed with lithium dodecyl sulfate
buffer and dithiothreitol, incubated at 70 °C for 10 min and
resolved on a 4–12% Bis–Tris PAGE gradient gel before
being transferred to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane. Following
transfer, the membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 h, washed
and incubated at 4 °C overnight with a rabbit primary mAb against
human GRP 78, GRP 94, GRP 75, or GAPDH (all purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology) at a 1:1000 dilution. The membrane was subsequently washed
and incubated with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary Ab (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature
at 1:2000 dilution. The bands were visualized using a SignalFire ECL
reagent (Cell signaling Technology) on a ProteinSimple FluorChem E
imager.

Cell Viability
Cell viability was determined in 24-well
plates with PC-3 cells cultured in RPMI-1640 complete growth media
and then incubated in the presence or absence of FITC–siRNA
(50 μM) for 72 h at 37 °C. After 24, 48, and 72 h, the
supernatant was collected, and the remaining cells were removed using
trypsin. Cell samples were pelleted and resuspended in 1% bovine serum
albumin in phosphate buffered saline (1 mL) and stained using PI according
the manufacturer’s recommendation. Samples were quantified
using an FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed
with Kaluza (Beckman Coulter) flow analysis software.

Statistical
Analysis
All data were plotted and analyzed
using the GraphPad Prism software, V 7.0d (La Jolla, CA). Each experiment
was performed in triplicates (N = 3). Data are represented
as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons between two groups
were analyzed using unpaired Student’s t-tests.
A probability (P) value of less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
