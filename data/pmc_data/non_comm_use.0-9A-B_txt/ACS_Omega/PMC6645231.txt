A novel on-the-fly calibration method of optical
tweezers is presented, which enables in situ control and measure of
absolute temperature and viscosity at nanoscale dimensions. Such noncontact
measurement and control at the nanoscale are challenging as the present
techniques only provide off-line measurements that do not provide
absolute values. Additionally, some of the present methods have a
low spatial resolution. We simultaneously apply the high temporal
sensitivity of position autocorrelation and equipartition theorem
to precisely measure and control in situ temperature and the corresponding
microrheological property around the focal volume of the trap at high
spatial resolution. The femtosecond optical tweezers (FOTs) use a
single-beam high repetition rate laser for optical trapping to result
in finer temperature gradients in comparison to the continuous-wave
laser tweezers. Such finer temperature gradients are due to the additional
nonlinear optical (NLO) phenomena occurring only at the nanoscale
focal plane of the FOTs. Because NLO processes are laser peak power-dependent,
they promote an effective study of physical properties occurring only
at the focal plane. Using FOTs at optically benign near-infrared wavelengths,
we demonstrate microrheological control and measurement in water by
adding a highly absorbing yet low fluorescent dye (IR780).

1 Introduction
Optical
tweezers1 have been developed
extensively to pursue the study of natural processes ranging from
micron to molecular dimensions.2−4 Optical tweezers with higher spatiotemporal
resolution can overcome the challenges to access the measurement of
nanometer displacements and piconewton forces on millisecond timescales.
In doing so, instrumentation, techniques, and theoretical developments
have been improved simultaneously to solve practical challenges which
are relevant to mankind.5−8 Still, reliable and accurate temperature sensing
at the nanoscale dimension in a contactless fashion is highly challenging
because of the nonavailability of absolute calibration of optical
tweezers at high spatial resolution. Some available techniques9,10 use magnetic probe particles to measure temperature in a contactless
fashion remotely but only work at submillimeter spatial resolution.
Thus, contactless temperature measurement with absolute calibration
process with spatial resolution from micro- to nanodimension is indeed
needed as, for example, temperature sensing in water at nanodimension
is of fundamental interest and practical significance. We have developed
a new method for absolute on-the-fly calibration
of femtosecond optical tweezers (FOTs) using the combination of position
autocorrelation11 and equipartition theorem12 presented as normalized position autocorrelation
function (NPAF). Our on-the-fly NPAF calibration
method signifies that the user can experimentally achieve in situ
absolute values at a high spatiotemporal resolution with easy processing
of time-domain data without Fourier transforms. The method presented
here is simple to use and requires a very low-level instrumentation
compared to other methods which use auxiliary lasers13,14 or acousto-optic deflectors.15 Additionally,
the NPAF16,17 approach has the major advantage over frequency-domain
measurements, especially for probing fast biophysical processes. This
is because the resolution of the commonly used approach of the power
spectral density (PSD) method depends on the “measurement time”
of the trapping data, whereas in the “time-domain” measurement,
the resolution does not get restricted by the “measurement
time”, rather it depends on the “sampling rate”.
Furthermore, in our NPAF approach, we only use a single wavelength
for all the three purposes: for trapping, for heating, and for probing.
The versatility of this approach promises to open its applicability
to numerous fields of research. For example, optical tweezers will
now offer to probe the behavior of biomolecules’ flexibility18 during heating or the way in which enzymes control
the metabolic activities of microbes at different physiological temperatures.19,20

For temperature rise demonstration purposes, we have successfully
applied our theoretical method which experimentally utilizes the aqueous
solution of the IR780 dye (see S1, Figure S1) for precise control and measurement of temperature (T) and viscosity (η) around the trapping zone. There is a continuous
effort to measure the temperature rise occurring at small volumes
because of optical tweezers at different continuous laser wavelengths,21−24 which has remained a subject of interest. For example, a temperature
rise occurs at 1064 nm because of absorption arising from the vibrational
combination band (2ν1 + ν3)25,26 of water, which has been of active interest.27−30 However, because water has very
low absorption31,32 at a wavelength of 780 nm because
of vibrational combination band 3ν1 + ν3,25,26 trapping at 780 nm does not produce an appreciable
temperature rise around the focal volume. The solution of the IR780
dye in water has a wide near-infrared (NIR) absorption band. The temperature
rise occurs as the IR780 dye absorbs some of the 780 nm trapping laser
and undergoes a strong nonradiative relaxation via thermal emission
from its excited state.33 Our technique
offers an extremely high gradient of temperature at very low diffraction-limited
spot size34 as femtosecond high repetition
rate laser pulses are used. The IR780 dye shows peak power-dependent
nonlinear optical (NLO) phenomenon, also known as saturable absorption
(see S2, Figure S2). Thus, the number of
molecules to be excited is controlled by the peak power of the femtosecond
laser used. We have interpreted the characteristic Brownian motion35 of a 550 nm radius (r) trapped
polystyrene bead to determine the surrounding temperature and viscosity.
Additionally, we have demonstrated this approach as a function of
wavelength to prove that it could be used as a new tool for microrheological
measurement and control in liquids with tunable lasers. In future,
multiphoton absorbing nonfluorescent molecules can increase the spatial
resolution of the control of temperature through the higher-order
NLO process36,37 possible to be measured through
FOTs.

2 Experimental Methods and Materials
2.1 Optical Tweezers Setup and Material
In our FOT setup
(Figure 1), mode-locked
Ti:sapphire laser (MIRA-900F pumped by Verdi
V5, Coherent Inc.) was used, which generates femtosecond laser pulses
centered at 780 nm wavelength with a repetition rate of 76 MHz. For
the trapping experiments reported here, a laser pulse width of 150
fs was used. The wavelength can be tuned from 730 to 900 nm with higher
pump power. The sample chamber was placed on a piezoelectric stage
(NSP3, Newport Co. USA), which was operated with a piezo controller
(NSP3, Newport Co., USA) connected to a personal computer via a NI
data acquisition (DAQ) card 6212 (National Instruments USA). This
DAQ was used to provide the known sine function to the piezoelectric
stage for voltage calibration using LabVIEW program. For achieving
tight focusing, an oil immersion objective (UPlanSApo, 100×,
1.4 NA, Olympus Inc. Japan) was used, and the forward scattered light
was collected and focused with another oil immersion objective (60×,
PlanApo N, 1.42 NA, Olympus Inc. Japan) onto a quadrant photodiode
(QPD) (2901, Newport Co. USA) that had a rise time of 5 μs.
The QPD output was connected to a digital oscilloscope (Waverunner
64Xi, LeCroy USA) interfaced with a personal computer through a GPIB
card (National Instruments, USA). The LabVIEW program was used for
DAQ. The commercially available fluorophore-coated polystyrene bead
of radius 550 nm (Figure 2a) with a concentration of 2.7 × 1010 particles/mL
suspended in water was purchased from Life Technology, USA (F8820,
lot number 30724W, currently Thermo Fisher, USA). The stock solution
was diluted at a subnanomolar concentration for the trapping experiment
and well sonicated for immediate use. We used 24 × 50 mm no.
0 cover glass sample chamber that was assembled by placing a coverslip
22 × 22 mm no. 1 separated by spacers of a double-sided sticky
tape. A CCD camera (350 K pixel, E-Mark Inc. USA) was used for monitoring
the video of the trapping event. A red filter was used before CCD
to follow a single trapped particle event. We used a white light source for bright-field
illumination. The IR780 dye was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification. The dye was dissolved in 4–5
drops of spectroscopic grade methanol, and then the 25 mL volumetric
flask was filled with distilled water. The absorption spectrum of
IR780 (Figure 2b) was
collected by the absorption spectrometer (Lambda 900, PerkinElmer
USA) at a concentration of ∼3.33 × 10–5 (M).

2.2 Dynamic
Light Scattering (DLS) Measurements
For DLS measurements,
we used the Malvern Nano ZS instrument that
had a 4 mW He–Ne laser (λ = 632.8 nm) and was also equipped
with a thermostat coupled sample chamber. In this instrument, the
detector angle was fixed at 173°.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Theoretical Section
Our theoretical
development is based on Einstein’s theory of Brownian motion.
This theory explains that the Brownian motion of a particle will change
because of continuous energy transfer between the particle and the
surrounding solvent in the form of the thermal energy of solvent into
the kinetic energy of the particle. The equation of motion of a particle
in a viscous Newtonian fluid, undergoing Brownian motion within a
harmonic potential well, can be expressed by the Langevin equation
as follows11,38,39 1  where m denotes the mass
of the particle, x signifies time-dependent position,
γ (=6πηr) is the viscous drag coefficient
as per Stokes’ law of particle having radius r moving in a solution having a viscosity of η, κTS is the trap stiffness, and F(t) is the time-dependent random thermal force. We have saved position
fluctuation data of a 550 nm radius trapped particle using QPD with
a sampling rate of 100 kHz. We have ignored the inertial effects as
the characteristic inertial time scale (m/γ
≈ 10–9 s) is beyond our detection method.
Thus, the motion of particles takes place at a small Reynolds number
where viscous drag dominates over inertial forces. The NAPF for this
particle when time-averaged over all the initial times t0 is16,40 2  where λ (=κ/γ)
is the characteristic
relaxation rate of the compound system. We intend to use the piezoelectric
stage coupled to a sample chamber to probe the experimental signal
from our initial known signal. We have moved the sample stage sinusoidally
with an amplitude of Ad = 178 nm at a
drive frequency of fd = 50 Hz such that
it does not overcome the particle’s natural Brownian motion.
Such a typical experimental technique using a trapped Brownian particle
closely follows the theoretical expectations as the technique involves
providing an additional known sinusoidal motion to the tweezers, which
enables absolute calibration in the time domain for the experiment.
Thus, the oscillation in the autocorrelation curve comes from the
provided drive signal, and our only region of interest is the decay
before the oscillatory behavior, that is, on fast time scales. Here,
the position of the stage varies as a function of time when the drive
motion is on as follows: 3  

As a result of this, the corresponding
response function can be obtained as41 4  

The time shift appears
because of the phase difference, which can
be ignored while taking position autocorrelation for a long time as
compared to the diffusion time scale of the particles. Then the equation
of motion of the spherical bead in the trap is 5  

The amplitude calibration
also needs to be done to minimize the
effect of ground voltage and electrical impedance. We have performed
amplitude calibration in water at room temperature. The NPAF is thus
represented as 6   7  

The coefficient b in
the above equations is useful
for the absolute on-the-fly calibration at a specific
sampling rate of DAQ. This calibration leads to the voltage to position
conversion factor (Cf) through the following
equation: 8  where ⟨x2⟩
is the variance in the position of the oscillating trapped
particle. The motion of trapped particles in harmonic potential42,43 with characteristic corner frequency fC will have a trap stiffness κ = 2πγfC. For sufficiently long measurement time (t ≫ fC – 1), we can calculate
the trap stiffness by applying the equipartition theorem as follows13 9  

For
absolute calibration, we have calculated calibration factor
from eq 8 and have numerically
solved and measured the temperature rise as per the following equation 10  

Here, the dynamic viscosity,
η(T), of the
fluid depends on the temperature of the fluid and kB is the Boltzmann constant. A general formula for the
dynamic temperature-dependent viscosity of water is given by44

This phenomenological expression
can be used to track the effective
friction coefficient as a function of temperature.

We have utilized
this method to measure the local temperature around
the optically trapped bead and the femto-newton/nanometer spring constant
with high accuracy. In this method, the interfacial temperature is
calculated from the viscosity of the surroundings of a trapped spherical
bead. There is no specific restriction on the tweezers for the application
of this approach. Last but not the least, this calibration technique
also does not require an additional correction term for interacting
with the surface45 as the near-interface
viscosity always has a higher value because of friction with the surface
of the cover glass. However, this absolute calibration technique can
measure that effect.

3.2 Experimental Section
We have used
FOTs to trap and manipulate 550 nm radius fluorophore-coated polystyrene
beads. Our trapping experiments are performed with 10–30 mW
average power and at 740–820 nm trapping wavelengths in the
aqueous solution of IR780. The femtosecond pulse produces a huge instantaneous
gradient force at small average powers.46,47 Such technological
developments in optical tweezers have resulted in exploring the three-dimensional
world of micro- to nanoscale.48,49 Here, for temperature
sensing studies, we have used an IR780 dye solution that has high
absorption at our trapping wavelength.

The IR dye shows a peak
power-dependent NLO, such as saturable absorption and reverse saturable
absorption that occurs only at the focal plane (resulting in 340 nm
in our FOT system).50,51 The mechanism of heating in an
aqueous solution of the IR780 dye occurs because of nonradiative relaxation
of the photoexcited molecule that increases the local temperature.
As the amount of heat deposited in the system depends on the amount
of radiationless relaxation, the number of photoexcited molecules
dictates the local temperature. We have probed the Brownian motion
of a trapped spherical polystyrene bead. The Brownian motion has changed
because of a continuous energy transfer between the trapped bead and
the solvent, resulting in the transformation of the thermal energy
of the solvent into the kinetic energy of the trapped bead.15 We have measured the corner frequency and variance
from the Brownian motion of the trapped particle to correlate with
the local temperature.

Pulsed tweezers have several advantages52−54 over conventional
continuous-wave laser tweezers because of the availability of high
peak powers at low average powers. Specifically, in absorbing media,
the available average power to the trapped bead is very small, which
may not generate dominant gradient force to trap the bead. Additionally,
for lower sized particles to probe nanodimensional local temperature,
it is even impossible to monitor the Brownian motion at low power
as it will not be able to trap the particle. Besides, at high average
powers, convection flow will destabilize the trap. The power-dependent
studies (10–30 mW) of our optical tweezers (Figure 3) have been performed at the
central laser wavelength of 780 nm (Table 1 and see S3, Table S1) with the laser pulse width of ∼150 fs at an IR780 dye concentration
of 1.25 × 10–5 and 3.33 × 10–5 (M).

We have acquired the position of the particle at 100
kHz using
a quad detector and analyzed only the first 0.5 s data. Such DAQ has
allowed us to measure the temperature and viscosity in all cases by
probing the thermal fluctuation of the 550 nm radius fluorophore-coated
polystyrene bead position with a LabVIEW controlled piezoelectric
stage. Such a demonstration of power and wavelength tunability of
our FOTs also indicates the general applicability of this method.
At higher dye concentrations, a strong convection flow55,56 directed to the focal region occurs, resulting in a velocity gradient
toward the beam focus. As long as the gradient force predominates
over the convection flow at the beam focus, it is easier to trap.
With time, the flow rate expeditiously increases even at constant
power and concentration, as the IR780 molecules accumulate near the
focal volume (see media file). We have measured the temperature change
to indicate that thermal flow exists, and the bead displacement due
to this flow is coupled with that of a regular confined Brownian motion.
We only correlate the measure of the displacement of the confined
Brownian motion as long as it is not very large to our temperature
change model. Also, we have only analyzed initial 0.5 s of trapping
data to keep the convection flow mostly decoupled with the Brownian
motion, thus throughout our measurement we have ignored the convention
effect. Furthermore, we have used a 100 kHz mechanical shutter controlled
via the LabVIEW program (SR475), which can have an opening time that
is shorter than or comparable to the thermal relaxation time. The
thermal relaxation time is defined as the average time required in
achieving the maximum temperature at the surface of the bead.57 This method can be further modified to measure
the temperature in the presence of higher convection flow using traditionally
modeled Boussinesq approximation.58 Our
study indicates that for the IR780 dye in water, at concentrations
of 3.33 × 10–5 and 1.25 × 10–5 (M) a temperature rise of 1.64 K/1.0 mW and 1.13 K/1.0 mW, respectively,
is observed (Figure 5a). Also, the wavelength-dependent temperature rise is shown in Figure 5b.

3.3 Advantages of Temperature Control with FOTs
We have developed an in situ method at a micro-to-nanoscale dimension
to measure and control the absolute temperature and hence the corresponding
microrheological property of viscosity in the condensed phase. We
have also measured nano- to femto-newton force constant (κ =
2πγfC) (see S5, Figure S3) for an optical trap in absorbing conditions.
Our approach of FOTs has several advantages as compared to the other
available techniques as discussed below:(i) The FOT approach
results in the on-the-fly calibration, which utilizes
the high temporal
sensitivity of position autocorrelation and equipartition theorem
(for detailed derivation, see S6). This method provides a very high
spatial resolution as compared to the other existing contactless methods.10,59 For example, the spatial resolution is 1 mm in fiber-optic infrared
radiometer, whereas our method can go down to a few nanometers, only
by probing the trapped single nanoparticle.52,60 Probing temperature at nanoscale volume requires a fast diffusing
nanoparticle, and hence, small trapping data are sufficient. In our
time-domain measurement, the resolution is not restricted by the measurement
time, whereas in the existing PSD approach, the resolution inversely
depends on the measurement time.

(ii) We used the high repetition rate
femtosecond laser for optical trapping, which enables finer temperature
gradients as compared to other techniques. This is possible because
of the additional NLO effect occurring at the focus of the FOTs with
a low average power that least perturbs the trapping medium.

(iii) In our FOTs, we also
observed that
at high dye concentrations, the trapped bead accelerates toward the
beam focus because of the strong convection flow directed toward the
focal region. Trapping is easily possible at the beam focus as long
as the gradient force predominates over the convection flow. By changing
the laser fluence, wavelength, dye concentration, and beam waist at
the focal volume, we can also control the convection current flow.
This phenomenon would be very useful for directional drug delivery
with FOTs.

(iv) The PSD
analysis has also been used
earlier for on-the-fly calibration in the frequency-domain
measurements of optical tweezers.39 However,
the PSD analysis uses the formalism of Fourier transforms to study
the Brownian fluctuations of the bead in the frequency domain. The
PSD analysis is thus computationally intensive requiring a heavy-duty
field-programmable gate array or digital signal processor integrated
circuit to do this calculation on-the-fly. The resolution of PSD depends
on the inverse of the measurement time. Consequently, for a trapping
event over a very short timescale (e.g., trapping of a quantum dot
or a highly diffusing nanoparticle), it is difficult to estimate the
absolute measurement. For our time-domain-based approach, however,
the resolution is not restricted by the length of the measurement,
it is, in fact, dependent on the sampling rate. Thus, our method presented
here is computationally simple and even works for small duration trapping
in both Newtonian and nonNewtonian fluids.61

(v) Furthermore, in our
NPAF approach,
only single wavelength is used for all the three purposes: for trapping,
for heating, and for probing, which minimizes the instrumentation
level and cost of the auxiliary laser.

(vi) There are also a few other indirect
techniques of optical tweezers that require additional coupled measurements,
such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence intensity,
and additional thermocouple to compare their efficiency in measuring
the temperature around the trapped bead. Such indirect methods highly
increase the complexity of the optical tweezers’ arrangement
and cater only to fluorescence active particles without offering any
measurement advantage. On the other hand, our direct FOT technique
is straightforward and also works for nonfluorescent particles because
we only analyze the scattering data.



4 Conclusions
We have demonstrated a novel on
the fly calibration
method of optical tweezers. Such a technique also provides an in situ
control and a measure of the absolute temperature and viscosity at
nanoscale dimensions. The experiments involved a polystyrene bead
trapped with a noninvasive NIR pulsed laser, which responded spontaneously
to a known sinusoidal modulation provided by the user to result in
the self-calibrated optical tweezers. Such in situ measurement and
control of absolute temperature and viscosity at nanoscale dimensions
are big challenges. Present techniques provide off-line measurements
that do not provide absolute values in real time. In our technique,
the oscillation in the autocorrelation curve comes from the provided
drive signal, and we are only interested in the decay before the oscillatory
behavior region, that is, on fast time scales. This method is even
very useful to achieve high spatial resolution as the time-domain
measurement is not restricted by the measurement time.
