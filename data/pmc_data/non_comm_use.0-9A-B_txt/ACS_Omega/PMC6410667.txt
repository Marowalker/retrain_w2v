Ameloblastin (Ambn),
the most abundant non-amelogenin enamel protein,
is intrinsically disordered and has the potential to interact with
other enamel proteins and with cell membranes. Here, through multiple
biophysical methods, we investigated the interactions between Ambn
and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), whose lipid compositions mimicked
cell membranes involved in epithelial cell-extracellular matrix adhesion.
Using a series of Ambn Trp/Phe variants and Ambn mutants, we further
showed that Ambn binds to LUVs through a highly conserved motif within
the sequence encoded by exon 5. Synthetic peptides derived from different
regions of Ambn confirmed that the sequence encoded by exon 5 is involved
in LUV binding. Sequence analysis of Ambn across different species
showed that the N-terminus of this sequence contains a highly conserved
motif with a propensity to form an amphipathic helix. Mutations in
the helix-forming sequence resulted in a loss of peptide binding to
LUVs. Our in vitro data suggest that Ambn binds the lipid membrane
directly through a conserved helical motif and have implications for
biological events such as Ambn-cell interactions, Ambn signaling,
and Ambn secretion via secretory vesicles.

Introduction
Enamel is composed
of hydroxyapatite (HAP) crystallites with an
architecture that is precisely ordered on several length scales.1 The formation of enamel occurs in the extracellular
matrix (ECM),2 which includes proteins
that interact with minerals, with other proteins,3−5 and most likely
with cells.6 Most ECM proteins in enamel
belong to the large secretory calcium-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP)
family, which evolved from a common ancestral gene more than 450 million
years ago.7,8 In enamel, the ECM consists of a distinct
set of macromolecules that are mostly intrinsically disordered, including
amelogenin (Amel), ameloblastin (Ambn), enamelin (Enam), and amelotin
(Amtn).9−12 These proteins self-assemble or coassemble to create a functional
three-dimensional ECM that serves to guide its own replacement by
the mineral phase.13−16

Ambn, also known as amelin or sheathlin, is the second most
abundant
proline-rich enamel matrix protein after Amel.17−19 The teeth of
ameloblastin mutant mice that lacked amino acid sequences encoded
by exons 5 and 6 were found to have a severely hypoplastic enamel
layer, establishing the importance of Ambn for proper enamel formation.6 Ambn is secreted together with Amel and is rapidly
processed by matrix metalloproteinase-20 (MMP-20) at its C-terminus
after secretion.20 The hydrophobic N-terminal
cleavage products accumulate in the “sheath” space throughout
the enamel layer, whereas the calcium-binding C-terminal cleavage
products accumulate on the enamel rods.21 Because of its localization at the rod–interrod boundary,
the N-terminal region of Ambn has been thought to play a role in defining
the prismatic structure of enamel. We recently reported that Ambn
is not the only protein fragment at the rod–interrod boundaries
but colocalizes together with Amel N-terminal fragments.4 In in vitro studies we further demonstrated interactions
between the N-termini of Ambn and Amel.4,22

Evolutionary
analysis of the Ambn sequences across 47 species shows
that this protein has kept its function in tooth enamel formation
for more than 200 million years in both prismatic and nonprismatic
enamel, which suggests that its functionality extends beyond prismatic
structure-building.23 Additional putative
functions may include communication between the ECM and ameloblast
cells. It has been proposed that Ambn may mediate cell–matrix
adhesion through its integrin-binding motif,24 heparin-binding motifs,25 or fibronectin-binding
motif.26 However, molecular modeling has
not revealed any regions in Ambn with structural similarity to known
receptor–ligand systems.27 A systematic
analysis of the full-length protein sequences of Ambn from 47 different
species in different classes showed that only a few species have these
motifs with identical sequences (see average conservation score in Table 1). It is therefore
unreasonable to assume that a protein functionality would depend on
these poorly conserved motifs. In contrast, the homogeneity in the
37 AA sequences encoded by exon 5 across species is relatively high.
This high level of conservation led us to hypothesize that exon 5
motifs are the critical motifs in the Ambn sequence for cell adhesion
function (Table 1).
Additional support for this hypothesis is based on mutant animal models
in which deletion of sequences encoded by exons 5 and 6 resulted in
detachment of extracellular enamel matrix from the ameloblasts. The
authors suggested that Ambn assists ameloblasts in adhering to the
ECM during the secretory stage of enamel formation.6 However, molecular mechanisms underlying such adhesion
and interactions have not been fully elucidated. No specific receptors
for enamel ECM proteins to adhere to the cells have been identified
to date. CD63 and Lamp-1 have been identified as putative receptors
for Amel.28,29 Although these receptors are involved in
endocytosis,30 they do not support cell–matrix
adhesion or construction of a functional matrix. Information on receptors
for Enam and Amtn is also limited.

In the present in vitro study, we
used liposomes or large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs) as a chemical model for cell membrane phospholipid
bilayers. These are structures composed of amphiphilic lipids and
have been extensively used as cell membrane models.31−33 The lipid composition
we used here was based on the membrane domain that is involved in
epithelial cell–ECM adhesion.34 Using
biophysical and Cryo-TEM methods, we investigated the binding of recombinant
mouse Ambn to lipid bilayers. For fluorescence spectroscopy, we designed
a series of Ambn Trp variants in which one or two of the three intrinsically
fluorescent Trp residues were changed to Phe. Structural changes as
a result of LUV addition were then detected using the remaining Trp
residues. We synthesized Ambn mutants lacking sequences encoded by
exons 5 and 6 to evaluate their function in LUV binding. We further
generated a series of Ambn-derived synthetic peptides and peptide
variants to identify the liposome-binding motifs in the Ambn sequence.
Our in vitro data have biological implications that are relevant not
only to Ambn–cell interactions but also to Ambn signaling and
to the mechanisms of Ambn secretion via secretory vesicles.

Results
and Discussion
Ambn Interacts with LUVs
LUVs were
generated using
a mixture of several lipids to mimic the primary lipid composition
of the membrane domains involved in epithelial cell–ECM adhesion
(Figure 1A).34 Mouse ameloblastin (Ambn) was expressed in Escherichia Coli, and the purified Ambn was characterized
by SDS-PAGE, mass spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
(Figures S1 and S2). Fluorescence (Figure 1B) and CD spectroscopy
(Figure 1C), Cryo-TEM
(Figure 2A–D),
membrane leakage (Figure 2E), and static light scattering (Figure 2F) were conducted to determine the interaction
between recombinant mouse Ambn and LUVs.

of LUV deformation based on Cryo-TEM images. The extent of LUV deformation
was defined by the ratio of the longest dimension to the shortest
dimension for each vesicle. The ratios of 60 selected LUVs for each
category (LUVs only and LUVs with Ambn) were measured. The inset shows
the averaged ratio of deformation (Student’s t-test, n = 60). (E) Normalized membrane leakage
of LUVs in the presence of two concentrations of Ambn and BSA, which
was used as the control. (F) Normalized static light scattering of
300 μM LUVs with two concentrations of Ambn and BSA, which was
used as the control.

Trp fluorescence spectra showed that Ambn had a blue shift
in the
presence of LUVs (Figure 1B). The emission maximum wavelength (Emax) had a blue shift of 2.8 ± 1.3 nm (Student’s t-test, p = 0.00005, n = 6) in the presence of 100 nm LUVs, suggesting that the presence
of LUVs changed the local environment of the Trp residues to a more
hydrophobic one, presumably as the result of its interactions with
lipids.

We monitored changes in the secondary structure by CD
spectroscopy.
The small peak at 208 nm and the shoulder at 222 nm in the absence
of lipids compared to the deeper, more pronounced peaks upon the addition
of LUVs indicate a coil-helix transition and suggest that Ambn is
mainly intrinsically disordered in solution (Figure 1C), which is consistent with a previous report.11 This coil–helix transition is also supported
by the rightward shift in the main downward peak. When LUVs were added,
the mean residue ellipticity at 190 nm (MRE190nm) increased,
forming a more pronounced peak, suggesting that Ambn became more structured.
The MRE208nm and MRE222nm decreased in the presence
of 100 nm LUVs, forming more pronounced negative peaks, suggesting
that α-helix content in Ambn increased in the presence of LUVs.
Analyses of the CD spectra using DICHROWEB showed that the α-helix
content increased from approximately 8.9 ± 1.3% to approximately
15.5 ± 2.7% in the presence of LUVs, whereas the percentage of
β-sheet and disordered structure decreased.

Direct visualization
by Cryo-TEM revealed that LUVs without Ambn
were spherical with a diameter of 103.8 ± 20.3 nm (Figure 2A), whereas LUVs with Ambn
lost much of their spherical shape and had an average longest dimension
of 106.8 ± 19.3 nm (Figure 2B). Cryo-TEM images of 1.0 μM Ambn did not show
any structures in the control or Ambn groups (Figure 2C). The extent of LUV deformation was defined
by the ratio of the longest dimension over the shortest dimension
for each vesicle. About 30% of the LUVs were deformed significantly
following the addition of Ambn. The average ratio of deformation was
1.06 ± 0.06 for 60 selected LUVs in the control group and 1.15
± 0.18 for 60 selected LUVs in the Ambn group (Figure 2D, inset). This difference
was statistically significant (Student’s t-test, p = 0.0001), suggesting that the morphology
of LUVs has changed in the presence of Ambn. We interpret these observations
to suggest that Ambn interacts with the phospholipid bilayer surface
directly causing this deformation. Under our experimental conditions
and Ambn concentration used (1.0 μM) to investigate Ambn–LUVs
interactions, Ambn neither formed detectable large aggregates nor
showed any defined morphology (Figure 2C).

Independent of Cryo-TEM observations, a membrane
leakage assay
showed that Ambn caused concentration-dependent membrane leakage starting
from 0.5 μM and increasing at 1.0 μM (Figure 2E). These observations suggest
that Ambn had a high affinity for the lipid bilayer of LUVs and disrupted
their membrane integrity in a dose-dependent manner. Disintegration
of the LUVs by Ambn was evidenced by decrease in their size distribution
when Ambn was added. Changes in the LUV size were monitored by measuring
static light scattering at 300 nm over time in a lipid vesicle clearance
assay. Static light scattering decreased rapidly in the presence of
0.5 μM Ambn and more rapidly in the presence of 1.0 μM
Ambn. BSA which was used as a negative control did not affect the
size distribution of LUVs even at 1.0 μM concentration (Figure 2F), implying that
Ambn altered the LUVs’ integrity in a specific manner.

Ambn Binds
Phospholipids via an N-Terminal Motif
The
presence of Trp in the sequences on enamel matrix proteins such as
amelogenin has allowed us to identify interacting regions of these
proteins with their targets using intrinsic fluorescence techniques.31,35 If a Trp residue is part of a membrane-binding region, a blue shift
in fluorescence would be detectable upon LUV addition because of immersion
of the Trp residue in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane.31,35 Here, in order to identify the membrane-binding regions of Ambn,
two Ambn W/F variants were designed and expressed (Figure S1). W402F (at the C-terminus) and W80F/W93F (at the
N-terminus) Ambn variants were created to identify whether the membrane
binding occurs at the C- or N-terminal end. W402F Ambn has only two
tryptophan residues at the N-terminus, and W80F/W93F Ambn has only
one tryptophan residue at the C-terminus (Figure S1), allowing us to distinguish the regions in which LUVs cause
conformational changes in Ambn upon interaction. As was previously
shown for amelogenin,31,32,35 CD spectra of the variants have confirmed that such variation does
not affect protein conformation (Figure S3). The emission maximum wavelength of the W80F/W93F variant did not
change significantly (p = 0.19) in the presence of
LUVs (Figure 3A), indicating
that the environment of the Trp402 at the C-terminus did
not change implying that the C-terminus of Ambn is not involved in
liposome binding. In contrast, the emission maximum wavelength of
the W402F variant shifted from 339.3 ± 0.6 to 336.3 ± 1.2
nm (p = 0.008) in the presence of LUVs (Figure 3B), indicating that
the solvent environment around the N-terminal Trp residues at positions
80 and 93 of Ambn has changed implying that the N-terminus is involved
in interaction with LUVs. These data together with the CD spectra
suggest that a key region possibly encompassing W80 and/or W93 binds
membranes because of hydrophobic interactions between its residues
and membrane lipids. We thus sought to locate possible key binding
regions.

In a mouse model (originally described as Ambn KO6 but later demonstrated to be a mutant
AmbnΔ5-636 in which exons 5 and 6
of Ambn were deleted), a truncated form of ameloblastin
that included the C-terminus was expressed, resulting in severe disturbance
of enamel formation and detachment of ameloblasts from the ECM.6 The authors then concluded that the cell binding
capacity of Ambn resides in the deleted portion, namely, sequences
encoded by exons 5 and 6. To examine whether sequences encoded by
exons 5 or 6 are involved in membrane binding, we created recombinant
mutants; the sequence encoded by exon 5 was deleted to create Ambn
p.Y67_Q103del (AmbnΔ5), and the sequence encoded by exon 6 was
deleted to create Ambn p.P104_V168del (AmbnΔ6) (Figure S1). Membrane leakage assays showed that
lipid vesicles leaked more slowly in the presence of the AmbnΔ5
mutant (Figure 4A,
red line). In contrast, vesicles became leaky faster in the presence
of wild-type Ambn and AmbnΔ6 (Figure 4A, blue and black lines). This difference
suggests that the ability of Ambn to disrupt membrane integrity was
lost when the sequence encoded by exon 5 was deleted. Lipid vesicle
clearance assays showed that the LUVs disintegrated into small entities
more slowly in the presence of AmbnΔ5, whereas they disintegrated
more quickly in the presence of wild-type Ambn and the AmbnΔ6
mutant (Figure 4B),
suggesting that Ambn lost its ability to interact with vesicles without
the sequence encoded by exon 5.

Figure 4 Ambn mutants lose their liposome binding
ability. (A) Normalized
membrane leakage of LUVs in the presence of 1.0 μM WT Ambn,
AmbnΔ5, and AmbnΔ6. (B) Normalized static light scattering
of 300 μM LUVs with 1.0 μM WT Ambn, AmbnΔ5, and
AmbnΔ6. (C) CD spectra of AmbnΔ5 and (D) AmbnΔ6
in the absence and presence of LUVs.

CD spectra of the mutants in solution are shown in Figure S4, and CD spectra of mutants with and
without LUVs are shown in Figure 4C,D. The spectrum of AmbnΔ5 in solution without
LUVs differs from AmbnΔ6 and WT Ambn spectra, possibly indicating
changes in the secondary structure that may lead to misfolding or
aggregation. Upon addition of LUVs (Figure 4C), AmbnΔ5 showed little to no change
in CD spectra, whereas AmbnΔ6 showed a slight change in CD spectra,
as the peak at 208 nm and the shoulder at 222 nm were augmented in
the presence of lipids (Figure 4D). Therefore, both of these regions of Ambn are important
for the helix–coil transition induced by the presence of a
membrane. The differences between WT Ambn and AmbnΔ5 CD spectra,
both in solution and in the presence of LUVs, as well as the lack
of membrane interaction observed in membrane leakage and static light
scattering experiments on AmbnΔ5 (Figure 4A,B) altogether suggest that exon 5 is required
for both membrane binding and maintenance of the ordered structure
of the protein. Although AmbnΔ6 disrupted LUV membranes nearly
as efficiently as WT Ambn (Figure 4A,B) and showed a slight increase in α-helicity
in the presence of LUVs (Figure 4D), its CD spectra upon addition of LUVs lacked the
significant rightward shift at 208 nm observed in the case of WT Ambn
(Figure 1C). This nuanced
result suggests that AmbnΔ6 has slightly diminished binding
to liposomes possibly because of folding or conformational changes.
We therefore suggest that although membrane binding occurs via the
sequence encoded by exon 5, the exon 6 sequence has an important structural
role to achieve the desired folding of the protein during membrane
binding. A family with amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) was found to carry
a genomic deletion of Ambn exon 637 and for the most part had thin, aprismatic enamel, underscoring
the functional importance of this region.

Synthetic Peptide Encoded
by Exon 5 Interacts with Phospholipids
To further pinpoint
the cell membrane-binding motif of Ambn and
confirm that the lack of AmbnΔ5 binding to liposomes was not
merely the result of protein misfolding, we examined the binding affinity
of a series of Ambn-derived peptides (AB1, AB2, AB4, AB5, and AB6)
to LUVs (Figure 5A, Table 2). AB1 included 40
amino acid residues encoded by exons 3 and 4, AB2 included 37 amino
acid residues encoded by exon 5, AB4 included 43 amino acid residues
encoded by exon 6, AB5 included 41 amino acid residues encoded by
exons 6 and 7, and AB6 included 44 amino acid residues encoded by
exon 13. AB5 was the linker sequence between two domains.

Comparative membrane
leakage assays using these peptides showed
that lipid vesicles became leaky in the presence of AB2 (a sequence
encoded by exon 5) but only slightly so in the presence of AB1 and
still less in the presence of AB4, AB5, or AB6 (Figure 5B), suggesting that the sequence encoded
by exon 5 could disrupt LUV membrane integrity. Trp fluorescence spectra
of AB2 showed a significant blue shift in the presence of LUVs (Figure 5C). The emission
maximum wavelength shifted significantly from 349.3 ± 0.4 to
339.5 ± 0.7 nm, suggesting that the microenvironment of the Trp
of AB2 became much more hydrophobic in the presence of LUVs. CD spectra
of peptides (AB1, AB2, AB4, AB5, and AB6) showed that only the secondary
structure of AB2 significantly changed in the presence of LUVs (Figure 5D–H), confirming
that AB2 is involved in membrane binding. When LUVs were added to
AB2, the MRE190nm of AB2 increased from to −7.2
± 0.3 to 9.4 ± 0.2 deg cm2 dmol–1 and the MRE222nm decreased from −2.2 ± 0.2
to −6.0 ± 0.8 deg cm2 dmol–1. Analyses of the CD spectra using DICHROWEB showed that the α-helix
content of AB2 increased from approximately 7.9 ± 1.6 to 25.0
± 3.1% in the presence of LUVs, whereas the β-sheet content
and disordered structure content decreased, suggesting that LUVs induced
AB2 to form an α-helix.

Using synthetic peptides, we show
that the sequence encoded by
exon 5 and not exon 6 interacts with phospholipids. We found that
the lack of sequence encoded by exon 6 resulted in slightly diminished
binding of Ambn to liposomes (Figure 4D). This may well be related to misfolding or premature
aggregation of Ambn which may lead to blockage of the interacting
domain (i.e., sequence encoded by exon 5) or interruption of ordered
Ambn self-assembly.15

The Liposome-Binding
Motif Is at the N-Terminus of the Sequence
Encoded by Exon 5
In order to further identify and narrow
down the lipid binding domain within the sequence encoded by exon
5, we synthesized AB2N peptide, representing the N-terminus of AB2,
and AB2C, representing the C-terminus of AB2 (Table 2). Membrane leakage assays showed that AB2N
made LUVs leaky, whereas AB2C did not (Figure 6A,B). CD spectra showed that AB2N was intrinsically
disordered, and its α-helix content increased from 7.0 ±
0.4 to 61.8 ± 6.6% in the presence of LUVs (Figure 6C). In contrast, AB2C had no
random coil to α-helix transition (Figure 6D). Trp fluorescence showed that the emission
maximum wavelength of AB2N shifted from about 350.0 to 336 nm (Figure 6E), suggesting that
the microenvironment of Trp became more hydrophobic in the presence
of LUVs. In contrast, the fluorescence spectra of AB2C did not change
significantly (Figure 6F).

Figure 6 The liposome-binding motif of Ambn is at the N-terminal end of
the sequence encoded by exon 5. (A,B) Normalized membrane leakage

the N- or C-terminal region of AB2, respectively. (C,D) CD and (E,F)
Trp fluorescence spectra of 10.0 μM AB2N or AB2C with 300 μM

Among full-length Ambn, AB2, and
AB2N, AB2N shows the purest coil-helix
transition, as evidenced by the isosbestic point of its CD spectra
at 203 nm (Figure 6C), the point at which many peptides’ CD spectra in random
coil and α-helical states intersect.38 In contrast, Ambn has an isosbestic point at ∼196 nm (Figure 1C) and AB2 at ∼205
nm (Figure 5E), indicating
the presence of regions with other structures or lacking in structure
alongside the region that turns helical in the presence of liposomes.
AB2N appears to consist only of the amino acids that undergo the helix–coil
transition observed in all three forms.

N-Terminus of the Sequence
Encoded by Exon 5 Contains an Amphipathic
Helix
An amphipathic helix (AH) is a common motif encountered
in various proteins and peptides, and it can act as a membrane anchor,
as a tool to deform lipid membranes, or as a sensor of membrane curvature.39,40 We analyzed the entire sequence of mouse Ambn for the presence of
amphipathic helices using Heliquest (Table S2). There are four overlapping regions at the N-terminus of Ambn between
residues 58 and 86 that have a tendency to form AH. We noted that
the N-terminus of the sequence encoded by exon 5 (AB2N) contains a
highly conserved sequence (91.9%) among 37 mammalian species tested
with a propensity to form an AH (69RLGFGKALNSLWLHGLLP86). The projection of AB2N on a helical wheel showed that
AB2N has a proper hydrophobic moment and net charge (Figure 7A and Table 3) and a putative hydrophobic face at its
N-terminus (Table S2), suggesting that
AB2N has the sequence requirements to form an AH upon its binding
to LUVs (Figure 7A).
The highly negative conservation scores (−0.55 among mammals
and −0.47 across 47 species) of the residues corresponding
to AB2N (AH motif) (Figure 7B–D) indicate that evolution has preserved this AH-forming
motif and reflect on its probable functional importance. The high
AH motif sequence conservation among mammalian species may suggest
a function in conservation of prismatic structures in mammals, and
it is the subject of future studies.41,42

by Consurf44 using the multiple sequence
alignment of these sequences and the empirical Bayesian algorithms.

The Positive Charge and Hydrophobic Surface in the Amphipathic
Helix of Ambn Are Vital for Its Liposome-Binding Ability
To examine whether the amphipathic character of AB2N is vital for
membrane-binding ability, a series of peptide variants of AB2N with
disruption to the hydrophobic face and charges (R69D/K74D, K74D, K74L,
N77K, and F72S) were synthesized (Table 3). In R69D/K74D, K74D, K74L, and N77K, the
positive charge on the polar side of the AH was changed to different
extents, but the hydrophobic face was not affected. These changes
were expected to affect the long-range electrostatic interaction between
the peptide and LUVs. In F72S, the hydrophobic face was disrupted
but the positive charge on the polar side of the AH was unchanged.
We expected that this change to the hydrophobic face would disrupt
the hydrophobic effect that transfers the peptide to the membrane.
We predicted that N77K might form an AH, whereas all other peptide
variants would not because of their altered net charge, insufficient
hydrophobic moment, or lack of a hydrophobic face. Fluorescence spectra
of R69D/K74D with LUVs showed no significant change upon LUV addition
(Figure 8A,F), suggesting
that R69D/K74D did not interact with LUVs. Fluorescence spectra of
K74D with LUVs had a slight blue shift (Figure 8B,F), suggesting that K74D interacted with
LUVs weakly. Fluorescence spectra of K74L, N77K, and F72S had similar,
significant blue shifts (Figure 8C–F), implying that the LUVs interacted with
these peptide variants. CD spectra of R69D/K74D and K74D showed no
significant change upon LUV addition (Figure 8G–H), suggesting that the mutated
AB2N did not undergo a random coil to α-helix transition because
of a lack of sufficient positive charge. The MRE190nm and
MRE222nm of N77K significantly increased and decreased,
respectively (Figure 8I), suggesting that N77K became more structured, with 37.1.0 ±
3.0% α-helical content (calculated by DICHROWEB) in the presence
of LUVs. This peptide also shows a typical isosbestic point near 203
nm between its CD spectra. In contrast to the fluorescence spectra
suggesting that F72S accumulated in the vicinity of negatively charged
membranes of LUVs through long-range electrostatic interactions (Figure 8E), CD spectra of
F72S showed no significant change (Figure 8J), indicating that F72S did not undergo
the random coil to α-helix transition (see Δθ @
θ = 222 in Table 3). Membrane leakage assays showed that R69D/K74D did not disrupt
membrane integrity and K74D disrupted it only weakly, whereas K74L
and N77K disrupted membrane integrity strongly (Figure 8K,L). These observations suggest that the
positive charge of the AH is important for membrane-binding affinity.
This outcome is as expected because the membrane is 25% negatively
charged and therefore should attract positively charged motifs via
electrostatic interactions. F72S with a mutation from a nonpolar to
a polar amino acid residue on the hydrophobic face (Figure 8L) only weakly disrupted membrane
integrity. This observation suggests that the hydrophobic face of
the AH is also important for membrane binding. Mutations on either
charged or hydrophobic residues showed attenuation of membrane binding,
supporting the notion that AB2N forms an AH in the presence of LUVs
and its amphipathic character is vital for liposome binding.

Conclusions
In order to explore the potential of Ambn
to directly bind cell
membranes, we investigated interactions between Ambn and large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs) as in vitro models for cell membrane lipid bilayers.
By applying intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy of Ambn variants in
which Trp residues were mutated to Phe, we identified the phospholipid-binding
region to be at the N-terminus. The finding that the recombinant Ambn
mutant AmbnΔ5 did not bind to phospholipids supported the notion
that interactions occur within the sequence encoded by exon 5. An
isolated synthetic peptide representing the sequence encoded by exon
5 interacted with the phospholipids, as we observed the peptide to
adopt an increased helical conformation as a result of LUV addition.
Other Ambn-derived peptides encoded by exons 3, 4, 6, 7, and 13 did
not show any conformational changes upon LUV addition suggesting a
lack in the ability to interact with phospholipids.

The current
in vitro study has provided important basic information
on the structure of Ambn and its properties and sets a foundation
for future mechanistic in vivo studies. Ambn is an intrinsically disordered
protein that gains ordered structure, specifically an α-helical
structure, in the presence of partially negatively charged lipids.
This happens as the N-terminal part of the sequence encoded by exon
5, which consists of a highly conserved AH motif, undergoes a coil-helix
transition and binds the membrane. We found that both hydrophobic
and positively charged residues in the helical motif are crucial for
this Ambn–membrane interaction.

Ameloblastin self-assembles
into ribbon-like structures via a three
Y motif (Y/F-x-x-Y/L/F-x-Y/F motif)45 located
within the sequence encoded by exon 5. It was recently shown that
triple mutations in this motif affected its self-assembly in vitro.
As reported by Wald et al. in a mouse model with mutations in these
three Y motifs, enamel appeared with disordered hydroxyapatite crystallites.45 Although these observations might highlight
the importance of Ambn self-assembly, evidence for Ambn self-assembly
in the mutant mice in vivo was limited. The defect in enamel formation
in those animals may well be the result of perturbation in Ambn–Amel
or Ambn–cell interactions.

In vitro studies together
with present data collectively show that
the exon 5 of Ambn is involved not only in its self-assembly and cell
membrane binding but also in its interactions with amelogenin.3,4,22,45 Ambn may play a role in tethering the enamel matrix to the cell
surfaces of ameloblasts, possibly through its interaction and coassembly
with Amel.4,46 Like Ambn, Amel interacts with multiple
targets via the same interacting domains in vitro and in vivo.4,22 We previously reported that recombinant Amel interacts with negatively
charged small unilamellar vesicles via its N-terminal motif.32 Notably, the N-terminus of Amel is also involved
in its interactions with Ambn, as well as in its self-assembly.22,47

Much study is needed to demonstrate such multitarget interactions
for both Ambn and Amel in vitro and in vivo and gain further insight
into the biological significance of Amel/Ambn–membrane interaction.
However, the findings that Ambn is intrinsically disordered and has
the potential to interact with different targets support such molecular
mechanisms in vivo.4,46,48,49 In addition the biological significance
of Ambn–cell interactions has been highlighted in recent mutant
mouse models.6 Cell culture studies will
be needed to confirm and explore Ambn interactions with ameloblast
plasma membranes. Finally, the outcomes of these studies have biological
implications that are relevant not only to Ambn–cell interactions
but also to Ambn signaling and to the mechanisms of Ambn secretion
via secretory vesicles.

Experimental Section
Sequence Analysis of Ambn
from Different Species Using Consurf
The amino acid sequences
were aligned using ClustalW. Then, the
multiple sequence alignment was uploaded to Consurf server (http://consurf.tau.ac.il/2016/), and the amino sequence of Mus musculus was used as the query sequence. The conservation score for each
amino acid of M. musculus Ambn was
calculated by the Consurf server using the Bayesian method. For each
motif of interest, the conservation scores of all the included amino
acids were averaged. As described by the Consurf server: “The
conservation scores calculated by ConSurf are normalized, so that
the average score for all residues is zero, and the standard deviation
is one. The conservation scores calculated by ConSurf are a relative
measure of evolutionary conservation at each sequence site of the
target chain. The lowest score represents the most conserved position
in a protein. It does not necessarily indicate 100% conservation (e.g.,
no mutations at all) but rather indicates that this position is the
most conserved in this specific protein calculated using a specific
MSA.”

Protein Expression and Purification
Recombinant mouse
ameloblastin (Ambn) and mutants were expressed and purified with histidine
(His), thioredoxin (Trx), and S-tags in BL21 E. coli using pET-32a plasmid (Novagen) into which mouse ameloblastin gene
(GenBank no. AAB93765.1) was inserted. The method is described in detail
in our recent publication.50 In brief,
Ambn and its mutants expressed in E. coli were purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA Agarose,
Qiagen), followed by dialysis through a 10k MWCO dialysis membrane
(SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing, ThermoFisher). The protein concentration
after dialysis was determined by BCA assay (Pierce BCA Protein Assay
Kit, ThermoFisher) and His-, Trx-, and S-tags were cleaved by Enterokinase
(light chain, New England Biolabs) at the designed cleavage site (Asp–Asp–Asp–Asp–Lys)
using 0.8 μL enzyme per milligram of protein (pH 7.5, in the
presence of 1 M urea, at 37 °C for 6 h with gentle mixing). The
cleaved fragments were separated from the protein with a reversed-phase
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Varian Prostar
system with Agilent OpenLab CDS software). Phenomenex C4 column (10
× 250 mm, 5 μm) was used and proteins were eluted with
an increasing gradient of 32–72% acetonitrile over 80 min,
at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The collected proteins were lyophilized
and characterized with SDS-PAGE (Figure S1). Mutagenesis was performed using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
(NEB). The primers were designed according to the NE Base Changer.
The Ambn variants Ambn W80F/W93F, Ambn W402F, Ambn Y67_Q103del (exon
5 deleted, AmbnΔ5), and Ambn P104_V168del (exon 6 deleted, AmbnΔ6)
were expressed and purified as described for the wild type. A schematic
presentation of the Ambn variants and mutants is shown in Figures 9 and 5A. Recombinant WT Ambn was characterized using mass spectroscopy
(Figure S1). DLS analysis of WT Ambn and
AmbnΔ6 revealed the presence of large assemblies at concentrations
above 1 μM but monomeric entities were also detected (Figure S2A,B,E,F,G,H,K,L). AmbnΔ5, on the
other hand, had a much more heterogeneous size distribution with lower
level assemblies at lower concentration when compared to the WT and
AmbnΔ6 (Figure S2C,D,I,J). This behavior
was consistent with what has been previously reported regarding assembly
characteristics of human recombinant Ambn lacking the sequence encoded
by exon 5.15

Ambn.

Peptide Synthesis
All peptides were synthesized by
Chempeptide Limited (Shanghai, China). Seven peptides (AB1, AB2, AB2N,
AB2C, AB4, AB5, and AB6) (Table 2) were designed based on the amino acid sequence of
mouse Ambn. Five peptide variants (R69D/K74D, K74D, K74L, N77K, and
F72S) were derived from the identified membrane-binding motif (AB2N)
(Table 3). The lyophilized
peptides were dissolved in distilled water at a concentration of 10
mg/mL and stored at −20 °C before use. Purity of the peptides
was determined through HPLC equipped with a Kromasil-C18 column (4.6
× 250 mm, 5 μm), and their concentrations were determined
using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermofisher).

Unilamellar
Lipid Vesicle Preparation
Large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs) were prepared as previously described.51 The lipid composition, which was based on the
membrane domain involved in epithelial cell-ECM adhesion, is shown
in Figure 1A.34 Commercial lipids (Avanti) were dissolved in
chloroform or methanol, and then were mixed to obtain a desirable
lipid molar ratio of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol
(POPI)/sphingomyelin (SM) = 40:25:15:10:10. Note that POPC, POPE,
and SM have neutral charge, whereas POPS and POPI are negatively charged.
Therefore, the ECM-adhesion-imitating LUVs used here are about 25%
anionic. The chloroform and methanol in the mixture were evaporated
under a stream of nitrogen, and the remaining lipid mixture was dried
in a vacuum desiccator overnight. The size of the LUVs used in all
experiments was 100 nm.

LUV–Ambn Interactions
The
interactions between
LUVs and Ambn were analyzed by Cryo-transmission electron microscopy,
membrane leakage assay, and lipid vesicle clearance assay (static
light scattering), as previously reported51 and as described below in detail. CD spectroscopy and tryptophan
fluorescence spectroscopy were used to analyze the conformational
changes in proteins and peptides as the result of their interactions
with LUVs.

Membrane Leakage Assay
For membrane
leakage assays,
the dried lipid mixtures were rehydrated in pH 7.4 buffer containing
10.0 mM HEPES, 50.0 mM KCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 3.0 mM NaN3, 9.0
mM ANTS (8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid), and 25.0 mM DPX
(p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide). The lipid suspension
was subjected to 10 freeze/thaw cycles, followed by 21 extrusions
through 400 nm-cutoff and 100 nm-cutoff polycarbonate filters (Avanti).
Unencapsulated ANTS and DPX were removed by size exclusion chromatography
using the Sephadex G-100 medium (GE Healthcare). The LUVs were collected
in pH 7.4 buffer containing 10.0 mM HEPES, 50.0 mM KCl, 1.0 mM EDTA,
and 3.0 mM NaN3.

The 300 μM 100 nm LUVs encapsulating
9.0 mM ANTS and 25.0 mM DPX were mixed separately with 0.5 μM
Ambn, 1.0 μM Ambn, 1.0 μM AmbnΔ5, 1.0 μM AmbnΔ6,
or 1.0 μM peptides, as previously described.51 One μM BSA and 0.05% Triton X-100 were used as the
controls. The release of fluorophore ANTS and its quencher DPX was
monitored by measuring the increase of ANTS fluorescence intensity
using a Quanta Master 4 fluorescence spectro-fluorometer. The excitation
and emission wavelengths were 380 and 520 nm, respectively. All of
the split widths were 5 nm. All data were normalized to the fluorescence
intensity when all vesicles were disrupted by Triton X-100.

Lipid
Vesicle Clearance Assay (Static Light Scattering)
For lipid
vesicle clearance and electron microscopy assays, the dried
lipid mixtures were rehydrated in pH 7.4 buffer containing 10.0 mM
HEPES and 50.0 mM KCl, then shaken in a glass tube to form large,
multilamellar vesicles (LMVs). LUVs with a diameter of 100 nm were
prepared by forcing the lipid suspension through polycarbonate filters
with an extruder.

Clearance of LUVs was monitored by measuring
the change of static scattering light intensity as a function of time
using a QuantaMaster 4 fluorescence spectro-fluorometer as previously
described.51 The excitation wavelength
was 300 nm, and the split width was 1 nm. The emission wavelength
was 300 nm, and the split width was 5 nm. LUVs with a diameter of
100 nm were diluted in pH 7.4 buffer containing 10.0 mM HEPES, 50.0
mM KCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, and 3.0 mM NaN3 to a molar concentration
of 300 μM. After monitoring this mixture for 500 s, 0.5 μM
Ambn, 1.0 μM Ambn, 1.0 μM BSA, 1.0 μM AmbnΔ5,
or 1.0 μM AmbnΔ6 was added. The data were then collected
for another 2000 s. Then, 0.05% Triton X-100 was added to disrupt
all vesicles, and the data were normalized to the intensity after
adding Triton X-100.

Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy
LUVs (10 μM,
100 nm) were mixed with 1.0 μM Ambn for 1 h at room temperature.
To prepare Cryo-EM grids, a 2.5 μl sample was applied to a Quantifoil
grid, blotted for 3.0 seconds with a filter paper in 100% humidity,
and then plunged into liquid ethane with a manual plunger. The image
was collected on a FEI Tecnai TF20 at an accelerating voltage of 200
kV using the TVIPS EM-Menu program. The instrument was equipped with
a 16-megapixel CCD camera. The nominal magnification used was 29 000
with 2 × 2 binning to increase the contrast. The images were
collected at the Electron Imaging Center for Nanomachines, UCLA.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
Ambn or Ambn variant
(2 μM) was mixed with 300 μM 100 nm LUVs in pH 7.4, 10.0
mM Tris-HCl buffer and kept at room temperature for 5.0 min before
measurements. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a
J-815 circular dichroism spectrometer (JASCO) over a wavelength range
of 190–260 nm using a 1 mm path length quartz cell. The circular
dichroism spectra were analyzed using DICHROWEB online with the CDSSTR
algorithm.52

Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence
Spectroscopy
Samples
were prepared as described for CD. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra
were recorded on a Quanta Master 4 fluorescence spectro-fluorometer.
The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, the emission wavelength range
was 300–400 nm, and all split widths were 5 nm. The changes
of emission maximum were analyzed to reveal the tertiary structural
changes of Ambn.

Analysis of AH
The projection of
sequences on a helical
wheel was conducted by Heliquest.53 The
factors determining the presence of the AH are the hydrophobic moment
(μH), number of proline residues (Pro), net charge, and whether
there is a putative hydrophobic face (H face).

Statistical
Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried
out using one-tailed Student’s t-tests. P-values were determined in Microsoft Excel. The differences
were considered significant if P < 0.05. The P-values are described in figure legends. All data were
representative of at least three independent experiments using different
batches of purified proteins.
