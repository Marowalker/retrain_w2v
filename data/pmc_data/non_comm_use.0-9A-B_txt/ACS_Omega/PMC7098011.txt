In
this article, carbon microspheres (CMSs) synthesized by the
hydrothermal method and CMSs-Fe (with Fe3+ adsorbed on
the surface of CMSs) were combined with ammonium polyphosphate (APP)
to achieve the fire safety improvement of thermoplastic polyurethane
(TPU). The fire safety performance of TPU composites was investigated
by the cone calorimeter test, microscale combustion calorimeter test,
thermogravimetric analysis/infrared spectrometry, Raman spectrometry,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.
The results showed that CMSs and CMSs-Fe can improve the fire safety
performance of TPU/APP composites and the effect of CMSs-Fe was better
than that of CMSs. The peak heat release rate of the sample containing
0.25 wt % CMSs and 7.75 wt % APP was 16.7% lower than that of the
sample containing 8.00 wt % APP, and the content of toxic gases was
also reduced in the fire smoke. Also, total heat release and total
smoke release of the sample containing CMSs-Fe were 54.7% and 11.6%,
respectively, lower than those of the sample containing 0.25% CMSs.
It confirmed the contribution of CMSs to the flame retardant system,
and the performance of CMSs is improved by adsorbing Fe3+.

1 Introduction
Thermoplastic polyurethane
(TPU) has been widely used in many fields
as a new multifunctional engineering plastic with outstanding performance.1,2 However, the wide spread use of TPU poses a risk arising from its
shortcomings of easy combustion and smoke generation.3−6 To overcome this shortcoming, there have been many flame retardants
used for the fire safety improvement of TPU. Also, it has been proved
that the use of additive flame retardants is an effective method.

In recent years, a wide range of flame retardants for TPU have
been discovered, and intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) have become
one of the hottest research areas because of their environmentally
friendly, low toxicity, and noncorrosive properties.7,8 The IFR system relies mainly on three components: acid source, carbon
source, and gas source.9 APP is often used
in the IFR system because it decomposes into polyphosphoric acid,
NH3, etc. when heated and can be used both as an acid source
and as a gas source.4,10 However, there are also some
problems in the practical use of APP, such as its low flame retardant
efficiency, large addition amount, and easy to cause smoke generation
during combustion. The deficiencies of APP are generally compensated
by adding it to TPU together with the synergistic flame retardant.
Liu et al. found that the pHRR of polyisocyanurate-polyurethane foams
reduced from 159.8 to 76.8 kW/m2 with the addition of 5.0%
aluminum hydroxide and 15.0% APP.11 Liu
et al. changed the molten viscosity by adding carbon black and APP
to the TPU, which greatly reduced the TSR of the TPU composites.12 Also, in the research of Nie et al., with addition
of 23.0% APP and 2.0% ferric pyrophosphate (Fe-PP) for PP, the value
of pHRR decreased from 179.0 to 95.0 kW/m2.2,13

Carbon materials have found some applications in flame retardancy
now. For example, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have
been combined with APP to reduce the flammability of the polymer.
However, they all have more or fewer disadvantages such as high price
and complicated synthesis process.12,14,15 Carbon microspheres (CMSs) are new carbon nanomaterials
that have received wide attention due to their high specific surface
area, thermal stability, low density, unique electronic properties,
and specific structure.16 Moreover, the
synthesis process of CMSs is simple and convenient to apply. They
have been used in lithium battery materials, supercapacitor electrode
materials, adsorption and catalyst carriers, and other fields.17−20 Research on the use of CMSs to improve the flame retardancy of materials
has made some progress. Mei et al. grafted CMSs onto the surface of
wool fiber, finding that the LOI value raised to 29.5% when the grafting
ratio of CMSs on the surface of wool fiber was 6%.21 Yang et al. prepared CMSs coated with Mg(OH)2 and proved that it can reduce the flammability of polyethylene terephthalate
in subsequent tests.22 There is no related
report on the use of CMSs to improve the fire safety performance of
TPU.

CMSs are used as templates for preparation of metal oxides
hollow
microspheres due to their excellent adsorption properties.23 According to this characteristic, iron ions
can be adsorbed to the surface of CMSs by a simple method. This study
aims to improve the fire safety performance of TPU by using CMSs and
CMSs-Fe with APP as a flame retardant. CMSs are synthesized by the
hydrothermal method. The sample was prepared by the melt blending
method and characterized by CCT, SEM, XPS, MCC, TG-IR, EDS, Raman
spectra, etc.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of CMSs and CMSs-Fe
2.1.1 SEM
of CMSs and CMSs-Fe
SEM photographs
of CMSs and CMSs-Fe are shown in Figure 1A–D. It was seen that the particle
size distribution of the CMSs synthesized by the hydrothermal method
is relatively uniform with a diameter between 100 and 500 nm. Furthermore,
the TPU/CMSs and TPU/CMSs-Fe composite masterbatch were prepared to
solve the problem of uneven dispersion due to adhesion between single
CMS. The iron ions adsorbed on the surface of CMSs cannot be found
by SEM photographs, but through the EDS test curve of Figure 1E, it can be confirmed that
iron was adsorbed on the surface of CMSs.

and (D) magnification 50,000 times; (E) EDS of CMSs-Fe.

2.1.2 XPS of CMSs and CMSs-Fe
The surface
element composition and chemical state of CMSs and CMSs-Fe were detected
by XPS, and the results of XPS are shown in Figure 2.24Figure 2A2 showed that the C1s spectra of CMSs are divided into three main peaks: 284.8, 285.6,
and 288.6 eV, corresponding to aromatic or alkyl aromatic groups (R–C6H5), ethers (C–O–C), carbonyl (R—C=O),
and carboxylic acid (O—C=O), and the C1s spectrum
of CMSs-Fe is also divided into these three peaks in Figure 2B2.25,26 The O1s spectrum of CMSs is shown in Figure 2A3. It is divided into two
main peaks: 531.7 eV and 533 eV, corresponding to carbonyl (C=O)
and ether or ester (C–OH or C–O–C), respectively,
while the O1s spectrum of CMSs-Fe is also divided into
these two peaks in Figure 2B3.25,26 It indicated that the surface
of CMSs contains more active oxygen-containing group such as carbonyl
group. XPS survey spectra of CMSs and CMSs-Fe are shown in Figure 2A1,B1. It was seen
that the surface of CMSs is mainly composed of C element (80.63 atomic
%) and O element (19.37 atomic %) and Fe element (0.48 atomic%) appears
on the surface of CMSs-Fe as shown in Figure 2A2. As shown in Figure 2B4, the Fe2p spectrum separates
two broad peaks at 710.9 and 726.1 eV, which are attributed to Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2, respectively,
and correspond to their satellite peaks at 715.6 and 736 eV.27 It showed that the Fe element is successfully
attached to the surface of the CMSs.

2.2 Fire Safety Performance of TPU Composites
2.2.1 Characteristics of Smoke Generation
Smoke is one of
the main factors that threaten human life in the
fire, so smoke suppression is an important part of improving the safety
performance of materials. The smoke production rate (SPR) and total
smoke release (TSR) represent the smoke generation during combustion
of the material.28Figure 3A shows the SPR curve of TPU composites (the
related data are listed in Table 1). From the development trend of the SPR curve of TPU,
the SPR has a fast rising phase after ignition, and the phase ends
at 95 s. Then the SPR remains within a certain range until the 190
s starts to rise sharply, reaching the peak SPR at 225 s. However,
when the APP and CMSs are added to TPU, the rapid rise phase of SPR
ends at 75–85 s and then rapidly drops and remains at a low
level until the end of combustion. This was because the TPU composite
carbonized after initial combustion to form a char residue layer,
which causes heat transfer and material exchange (oxygen, combustible
gas, smoke precursors, etc.) between the upper and lower sides to
be hindered, and further spread of flame begins to be inhibited. The
carbon layer formed by the pure TPU material is porous and fragile,
so its combustion continues to become more intense. Also, for samples
with APP and CMSs, the char residue structure becomes dense, so the
severity of the combustion rapidly decreases and remains at a lower
level.

Compared with the peak SPR
value of TPU (0.101 m2/s),
that of TPU-APP (0.040 m2/s) is reduced by 60.4%. It could
be explained by the early decomposition of APP to produce phosphoric
acid, polyphosphoric acid, metaphosphoric acid, and other products
to help form a carbon layer with a three-dimensional mechanism, which
can better block heat and hold gas-phase products, so that the subsequent
combustion intensity greatly weakened and the peak SPR is reduced.4 Then, with the further addition of CMSs, the
peak SPR values are lower. The CMSs0.50 sample with 0.5% CMSs and
7.5% APP showed the lowest peak SPR value (0.029 m2/s),
which is 71.3% lower than that of TPU and 27.5% lower than that of
TPU-APP. The peak SPR values of samples containing CMSs-Fe are slightly
higher than those of samples containing CMSs, but both of them have
a tendency to decrease with increasing addition. This shows that CMSs
effectively reduce the peak SPR value of TPU and play a role in suppressing
smoke.

The TSR curve of TPU composites is shown in Figure 3B. The TSR value
of TPU (1005.3 m2/m2) is the highest and that
of TPU-APP (452.4 m2/m2) is the lowest in all
samples at the end of the experiment.
The low TSR of TPU-APP benefits from its short burning time, and the
TSR values of CMSs0.25 (366.6 m2/m2) and CMSs-Fe0.125
(353.0 m2/m2) are lower when the burning of
TPU-APP ends at 755 s. It is explained as that the participation of
CMSs improves the carbonization performance of APP. CMS in TPU can
increase the viscosity of the melt during pyrolysis, promoting the
fixation of the smoke precursor in the condensed phase.29 However, the thermal insulation effect of the
carbon layer containing CMSs is weakened. Under the continuous high
heat radiation, the combustion process cannot be completely ended,
thus making the burning time greatly extended, resulting in a high
TSR. Also, from the trend of pSPR and TSR of samples containing CMSs-Fe,
the participation of a small amount of CMSs-Fe makes the sample have
a high pSPR and a low TSR, which also confirms the above conjecture
and also indicates the strengthening effect of iron on the carbon
layer.

2.2.2 Characteristics of Heat Generation
Another main threat in the fire field is the high temperatures caused
by the combustion of materials, so the thermal parameters are an essential
indicator when evaluating the fire safety performance of materials.

The HRR curve of TPU composites is shown in Figure 4A. After ignition, the HRR value of the TPU
composite rises rapidly and reaches a peak in a period of time. The
HRR value of the TPU is 678.9 kW/m2 at 230 s. When APP
is added, the pHRR value is reduced to 233.5 kW/m2 at 95
s, which is only 34.4% of TPU. All other samples had lower pHRR values
around 95 s, which are 210.2, 194.6, 197.4, 209.0, 210.0, and 199.6
kW/m2. The above results show that the combination of CMSs
and APP can effectively lower the pHRR value of TPU composites. The
existence of CMSs provides the carbon source for the flame retardant
system containing APP, which contributes to the formation of the carbon
layer during combustion. However, after 120 s, the HRR values of TPU
composites containing CMSs and APP start to be higher than those of
TPU composites containing APP alone, which is due to the reduced thermal
insulation properties of the carbon layer formed by the synergistic
effect between CMSs and APP, resulting in the continuous decomposition
of the matrix material into combustible gases participating in the
combustion process under the high heat radiation of CCT.

Figure 4 (A) HRR and
(B) THR curves of TPU composites from CCT.

Figure 4B clearly
shows that CMSs-Fe performs better than CMSs in reducing THR. The
THR of TPU-APP is greatly reduced compared to that of TPU, but the
addition of CMSs increases the THR of the samples. However, the THR
value of CMSs-Fe0.25 is lower than that of TPU-APP until the flame
is out, and its final THR value is only 13% higher than the latter.
The results of THR are consistent with the results of TSR. CMSs help
accelerate the formation of the carbon layer but are not conducive
to the thermal insulation and strength of the carbon layer, which
makes the sample perform poorly in the later stage of testing. The
CMSs-Fe has improved this situation to some extent, which is due to
the strengthening effect of iron in the formation of the carbon layer.

2.2.3 Release Curve of CO and CO2
In addition to high temperature and smoke, the toxic gases produced
by the decomposition of materials are harmful to people in the fire.
CO is such a gas that it can both poison people and be a flammable
gas, which is highly harmful.30Figure 5A shows the release
curve of CO (the specific values are listed in Table 1). The concentration is reduced with the
addition of APP and CMSs. The peak of CO concentration of TPU-APP
is 0.023%, reducing by 32.4% compared with that of TPU (0.034%). It
is worth noting that the samples, which are further added with CMSs
and CMSs-Fe, show a stronger effect of CO suppression than TPU-APP.
The peaks of CO concentration of CMSs0.125, CMSs0.25, and CMSs0.50
are 0.018, 0.019, and 0.016%, reducing by 21.7, 17.4, and 30.4% compared
with that of TPU-APP, respectively,. Also, the peaks of CO concentration
of CMSs-Fe0.125, CMSs-Fe0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.50 are 0.019, 0.017, and
0.017%, reducing by 17.4, 26.1, and 26.1% compared with that of TPU-APP,
respectively. It proves that the presence of APP can suppress the
production of CO, reducing the fire risk of TPU materials. Moreover,
the peaks of CO concentration, which contain APP, CMSs, or CMSs-Fe,
appear in advance, and its reason is the addition of APP to TPU, which
also corresponded to the curves of SPR and HRR.

Figure 5 (A) CO and (B) CO2 release curve of TPU composites from
CCT.

CO2 is a kind of gas
produced in large quantities in
the combustion of materials. Excessive concentration of carbon dioxide
in the air may cause difficulty in breathing or even suffocation.31Figure 5B shows the release curves of CO2 (the specific
values are listed in Table 1). The peak of CO2 concentration of TPU-APP is
0.21%, reducing by 70.4% compared with that of TPU (0.71%). Especially
noteworthy is the fact that the CO2 concentration curve
samples containing both APP and CMSs (CMSs-Fe) lost their sharp peak
and their maximum CO2 concentration is decreased by 25%
compared with the peaks of CO2 concentration of TPU-APP.
The test results of CO and CO2 concentration show that
the CMSs and CMSs-Fe have reduced harmful gases generated by TPU combustion
and improved its fire safety performance.

2.2.4 Mass
Change Curve
The mass change
curve of the TPU composite is shown in Figure 6 (the specific values are listed in Table 1). It is clear that
the mass loss of TPU composites containing APP and CMSs (CMSs-Fe)
is much less than that of pure TPU. However, corresponding to the
results of TSR and THR, the mass loss of TPU-APP is lower than that
of other samples with CMSs or CMSs-Fe. It is explained as that the
thermal insulation performance and stability of the carbon layer generated
by the CMSs synergistic APP are weakened compared with the APP alone,
so that the heat is more transmitted to the lower layer, causing the
material to continuously decompose. The gas generated by the decomposition
and the high heat radiation from the cone calorimeter further cause
the carbon layer to be destroyed, and finally, the burning time of
the material is greatly prolonged, resulting in a decrease in residual
mass. Another point that can be found is that CMSs-Fe0.25 has the
lowest mass loss in all samples at the same burn time, further validating
the positive effects of CMSs-Fe on the flame retardant process.

Figure 6 Mass change
curve of TPU composites from CCT.

2.2.5 Thermal Decomposition Characteristics
The HRR obtained by the MCC test is expressed as the amount of
heat released per unit time of the material per unit mass at a specific
heating rate, as shown in Figure 7A and Table 2. The peak value of HRR means the maximum decomposition rate
of the TPU composite. The decomposition process of TPU is advanced
after the addition of APP, with its maximum decomposition rate dropping
from 536.9 to 499.5 W/g, and the corresponding temperature decreased
by 53 °C. However, with the further addition of CMSs, the temperature
corresponding to the maximum decomposition rate is still close to
that of TPU-APP. This indicates that the APP contained in the TPU
composite leads to its early decomposition.4 The maximum decomposition rates of CMSs0.125 and CMSs0.25 are higher
than that of TPU-APP, but that of CMSs0.50 is lower. The samples containing
CMSs-Fe are similar, but the maximum decomposition rate of CMSs-Fe0.50
is the lowest. It is not consistent with the results of the CCT test,
which is due to the different test conditions and the heating way
for the samples. In the CCT test, the single surface of a large sample
(about 50 g) is heated by constant radiance, and the construction
of the surface carbon layer is very important for the reduction of
the combustion intensity under such conditions; the samples with small
mass (about 5 mg) are heated on all sides, and the test temperature
is continuously increased, so that the barrier effect of the carbon
layer could not be reflected.

Thermogravimetric analysis is an
important means of analyzing the
thermal degradation behavior of materials at different temperatures
and is widely used to assess the fire safety performance of materials.32 The temperature at which the sample mass loss
is 5% is usually considered to be the initial decomposition temperature. Figure 7B,C show the TG and
DTG curves of TPU, TPU-APP, CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25. The initial
decomposition temperature of TPU is 334 °C, and those of TPU-APP,
CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 are 307, 310, and 309 °C, earlier than
TPU. The early arrival of their peak DTG temperature can also be seen.
It is attributed to the reaction between TPU and APP and is consistent
with the fact that the ignition time is advanced in the CCT test.
At the end of the test, the remaining mass of TPU is about 0.80%,
while the remaining masses of the TPU-APP, CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25
are much higher than it, which are 27.04, 25.70, and 27.8%. In addition,
the DTG peaks of CMSs0.25 and CMSs-Fe0.25 are also lower than that
of TPU but higher than that of TPU-APP, which is inconsistent with
SPR and HRR but consistent with MCC results. It is due to the similarity
of the TG and MCC test conditions. Although the presence of APP and
CMSs (CMSs-Fe) promotes the advance formation of the surface carbon
layer during thermal degradation of TPU, thereby protecting the internal
composite from further thermal degradation, the protection of the
carbon layer is weakened under the conditions tested.

TG-IR
was used to analyze the gas-phase product of thermal degradation
of TPU composites. Figure 8 provides infrared spectra of gas-phase products of TPU, TPU-APP,
CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 at 180–720 °C. The specific
infrared absorption peaks in the infrared spectrum represent certain
products, which can be used to determine the composition of the gas-phase
product. The gas-phase products thermally degraded by the sample mainly
include H2O (3400–4000 cm–1),
CO2 (2300–2400 cm–1), carboxylic
acid (1700–1850 cm–1), and aliphatic hydrocarbons
(2800–3150, 1250–1500, and 950–1150 cm–1).33 TPU will decompose violently to generate
a large amount of H2O and CO2 when heated, and
according to this, the progress of TPU decomposition can be judged.
The infrared absorption peak of CO2 (2350 cm–1) appears at 220 °C (Figure 8), indicating that TPU starts a small amount of decomposition
at this temperature, and this continues until 360 °C. After 360
°C, the intensity of the infrared absorption peak of CO2 increases rapidly, representing the accelerated decomposition of
TPU. The infrared absorption peak of CO2 begins to decrease
after reaching a maximum at 460 °C and enters a stable CO2 release stage at 560–700 °C. The same trend as
the infrared absorption peak of CO2 is those of H2O (3400–4000 cm–1) and aliphatic hydrocarbons
(2800–3150, 1250–1500, and 950–1150 cm–1), all of which are derived from multiple deploymerizations of TPU.
The infrared absorption peak of the carboxylic acid (1700–1850
cm–1) appears at 460 °C, and the carboxylic
acid comes from the soft segment of the TPU, which is released when
the decomposition is most severe. The CO2 infrared absorption
peaks of TPU-APP, CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 begin to increase at 300
°C, reaching the highest at 360 °C, and then enter the steady
state after 600, 520, and 580 °C, respectively. On the one hand,
the early decomposition of TPU-APP, CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 contributes
to the construction of the carbon layer; on the other hand, the maximum
values of the CO2 infrared absorption peak of them are
much smaller than that of TPU. This is evidence that APP and CMSs
(CMSs-Fe) reduce the severity of TPU cleavage. In addition, a decrease
in the infrared absorption peak at 3000 cm–1, which
represents an unsaturated C–H structure in an aromatic compound,
generally considered to be a source of the smoke. The smoke suppression
effect of APP and CMSs (CMSs-Fe) was also confirmed.

2.3 Characterization of Char Residue
Figure 9 shows photographs
of the carbon residue and its SEM images. The carbon residue is from
the CCT test, and its complete surface is selected for SEM testing.
The surface of the carbon residue after TPU combustion exhibits a
light and fragile characteristic, and its SEM image also shows a structure
whose surface is not compact and small holes that can be released
by the combustible gas. This obviously does not effectively shield
heat transfer and upper and lower material exchange during combustion.
From the SEM images, the surface layers of the carbon residue of TPU-APP,
CMSs0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 are smoother and more compact than that
of the TPU, which greatly improve the heat transfer resistance and
the effect of combustible products. From the photograph of the carbon
residue, the carbon layer generated by TPU combustion is relatively
low, and the samples containing APP have a relatively high carbon
layer after combustion. Even if the carbon layer of the TPU-APP is
broken when it is taken out after the test because of the high expansion
of the burning test device, its remaining height is still 3.5 cm,
which is the same as that of the CMSs. The thinner carbon layer has
a weaker ability to block heat and decomposition products, which is
the reason why the burning time of samples containing CMSs is prolonged.
This situation arises because the increase in viscosity of the TPU
matrix by CMSs weakens the degree of expansion of the carbon layer.
In addition, CMSs-Fe0.25 has a carbon layer height of only 3.1 cm,
but its thermal parameters and smoke parameters are lower than those
of CMSs0.25. This shows that CMSs-Fe not only has the effect of CMSs
accelerating the formation of carbon layers but also makes the carbon
layer more compact and strong, and its mechanism is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Flame Retardant Mechanism for the Effect of CMSs-Fe
on TPU
The degree of graphitization
of the carbon residue after CCT testing
can be obtained by Raman spectroscopy, which is often used to indicate
the density of the carbon layer.34 Therefore,
the higher the degree of graphitization of the carbon layer, the better
the performance of blocking flammable gas release and heat transfer.35 The fitting curve of the Raman spectrum is shown
in Figure 10. The
degree of graphitization of the carbon layer is represented by the
integrated intensity ratio of the D peak (1300 cm–1) and the G peak (1580 cm–1) (ID/IG), and the higher the
value of ID/IG, the lower the degree of graphitization.34 From Figure 10A–C,
the ID/IG values
of TPU, CMSs 0.25, and CMSs-Fe0.25 are 3.33, 2.89, and 2.69, respectively.
This shows that the synergistic use of APP and CMSs can effectively
improve the degree of graphitization of the carbon layer, which is
due to the dehydration carbonization effect of APP. Also, the effect
of CMSs-Fe is better than that of CMSs, which means that the addition
of iron helps to improve the degree of graphitization of carbon residue.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, the effects of CMSs (CMSs-Fe) and APPs on the fire
safety performance of TPU were tested by various measures. The contribution
of CMSs (CMSs-Fe) to the flame retardant system was discussed with
the sample containing only APP as the control. The further addition
of CMSs increases the effect of APP on char formation, but it also
weakens the thermal insulation of the carbon layer. Compared with
TPU-APP, the pSPR, pHRR, CO, and CO2 of CMSs0.25 were all
reduced, but THR, TSR, and mass loss were all increased. It is worth
noting that the samples added to the CMSs-Fe performed better than
the samples added to the CMSs. It can be seen from this that CMSs
have certain defects, but its value is that the activated surface
layer of CMS makes it easy to be modified. On the one hand, it can
make up for the defects of CMSs; on the other hand, it acts as a resistance.
The carrier of the burning component plays a greater role.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TPU
(Desmopan 9380A) was
produced by Covestro, Germany. The basic properties of TPU are as
follows: density, 1.11 g/cm3 (ISO 1183); hardness, 82A
(ISO 868); tensile strength, 40 MPa (ISO 527-1, 527-3); elongation
at break, 500% (ISO 527-1, 527-3). Analytical pure glucose was produced
by Tianjin Beichen Fangzheng Reagent Factory. APP (2500 mesh) was
produced by New Thin Metal and Chemical Co. Ltd., Guangzhou, China.
Iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) was produced by Qidong
Mingcheng Chemical Co. Ltd., Jiangsu, China. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was produced by Aladdin Biochemical
Technology Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China.

4.2 Sample
Preparation
4.2.1 Preparation of CMSs and
CMSs-Fe
CMSs were produced by the hydrothermal method according
to the literature.36 First, an aqueous
solution of glucose having
a concentration of 0.5 M was prepared, and then 300 mL was transferred
to a hydrothermal reaction vessel having a capacity of 500 mL and
heated at 180 °C for 12 h in an oven. After cooling, the resulting
suspension was filtered, and the solid phase portion was retained.
The solid-phase portion was washed with deionized water and absolute
ethanol and washed once with DMF to obtain wet slurry CMSs.

Ten grams of freshly prepared CMSs was added into a 200 mL concentration
of 0.4 mol/L Fe(NO3)3 solution, followed by
stirring for 1 h. It was dispersed under ultrasonic waves for 15 min
and allowed to stand for 5 h. After standing for 5 h, it was washed,
filtered, and dried to obtain CMSs-Fe.

4.2.2 Preparation
of TPU/CMSs and TPU/CMSs-Fe
Composite Masterbatch
The TPU/CMSs composite masterbatch
was prepared by the solution-blending method. TPU was dissolved in
DMF (5 mL of DMF/1 g of TPU) at 80 °C for 2 h, then wet slurry
CMSs (9 g of TPU/ 1 g of CMSs) were added to TPU solution. After vigorous
mechanical stirring and ultrasonic shock at 80 °C for 3 h, the
obtained black mixture was dried to a constant weight at 90 °C
in a drying oven to obtain a masterbatch with a CMS mass ratio of
10%.37 The preparation method of TPU/CMSs-Fe
composite masterbatch was the same as above.

4.2.3 Preparation
of Flame Retardant TPU Composites
The TPU composite was prepared
by the melt-blending method. Both
TPU and APP were dried at 80 °C for 12 h before use. A specific
quality of TPU is first melted in an internal mixer of 180 ±
5 °C, and then a certain quantity of TPU/CMS (TPU/CMSs-Fe) composite
masterbatch and APP were added. The mass ratio of TPU, TPU/CMSs (TPU/CMSs-Fe)
composite masterbatch, and APP was changed to get different materials,
and the proportion is shown in Table 3. The material from the mixer is processed through
a flat vulcanizer at 180 ± 5 °C (with a size of 100 ×
100 × 3 mm3).

4.3 Measurements
4.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive
X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)
CMSs and char residue from CCT were
observed by a JEOLJSM 6700 LV scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JEOL,
Japan) and a JMS-700 energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (JEOL,
Japan) at accelerating voltages of 5 and 8 kV.

4.3.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The elemental
composition and chemical state of CMSs and CMSs-Fe
were studied by a XPS spectrometer (Thermo ESCALAB 250XI, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA).

4.3.3 Cone Calorimeter Test
(CCT)
A cone
calorimeter device (Fire Testing Technology, U.K.) was used to study
the combustion behaviors of the samples. The CCT test was carried
according to the ISO 5660-1 standard. Each sample was in size of 100
× 100 × 3 mm3 and wrapped in aluminum foil, and
CCT power is set to 35 kW/m2. The test ends when the sample
being tested is flame out and the curve of each test item stabilizes.

4.3.4 Microscale Combustion Calorimeter (MCC)
The flammability of TPU composites was further tested by a microscale
combustion calorimeter (MCC-2, Govemark Ltd., McHenry, Illinois, USA).
About 5 mg of TPU composites was put in a crucible and heated from
75 to 750 °C at a heating rate of 1 K/s. The total test time
is 675 s.

4.3.5 Thermogravimetric Analysis/Infrared
Spectrometry
(TG-IR)
A thermogravimetric analyzer (DT-50) (Setaram Instrumentation
Co. Led., France) was used to test the thermal stability of TPU composites.
About 10 mg of sample was placed in a crucible and heated from 40
to 750 °C (20 K/min, N2 60 mL/min). The pyrolysis
gas components from the TG analyzer were then analyzed by an affinity-1
FTIR spectrometer (170SX) (Shimadzu, Japan).

4.3.6 Raman
Spectrometer
The graphitization
degree of char residue after CCT was studied by Raman spectroscopy
(Horiba Scientific Lab RAM HR Evolution, France). The laser wavelength
is 514 nm during the test, and the wavelength range is 50–4000
cm–1.
