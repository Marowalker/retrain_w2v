The quantitative
structure–property
relationship (QSPR) models for predicting the octane number (ON) of
toluene primary reference fuel (TPRF; blends of n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene) was investigated. The electrotopological
state (E-state) index of TPRF components was computed and weight-summed
to generate the quantitative descriptor of TPRF samples. The partial
least squares (PLS) technique was used to build up the regression
model between the ON and weight-summed E-state index of the investigated
samples. The QSPR models for the research octane number (RON) and motor octane number (MON) of
TPRF were built. The prediction performance of the obtained PLS models
was assessed by the external test set validation and leave-one-out
cross-validation. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed
PLS models are feasible for predicting the ON, both RON and MON, of
TPRF. In addition, several other QSPR models for the ON of TPRF were
developed by employing the stepwise regression and Scheffé
polynomials methods, and the prediction performance of these models
were compared with that of the PLS models. The comparison result shows
that the proposed PLS models are slightly better than multiple linear
regression models and Scheffé models. It is demonstrated that
the combination of the E-state index and PLS is an easy-to-use and
promising method for studying and forecasting the ON of TPRF.

1 Introduction
Octane
number (ON), also known as octane rating, is a standard
index widely used to measure the resistance of an engine or fuel to
knock. The higher the ON, the more compression a fuel can withstand
before detonating (igniting).1−3 In other words, the higher the
ON, the more compression required for the ignition of a fuel. Fuels
with different ONs must be utilized in different engines. In broad
terms, fuels with a higher ON are used in high-performance internal-combustion
engines that demand higher compression ratios. The use of fuels with
a lower ON than the requirement of an engine may lead to engine knocking.
With the increase in the demand for more efficient vehicles, and the
continuous increasing global consumption of high-quality anti-knock
fuels, studies on the determination and control of fuels’ ON
have attracted much attention in recent decades. There are two standard
empirical measurements for ON, known as research octane number (RON)
and motor octane number (MON). The two numbers quantify the anti-knock
quality of fuels under two different working conditions.4−9

Since commercial fuels are mixtures of numerous compounds
that
are usually inconsistent due to the different crude oil origin and
refinery processes, at present, understanding the chemical properties
and behaviors of fuels is a complicated and hard task. To solve this
problem, researchers usually employ mixtures (surrogates) to mimic
and study the properties and behaviors of real fuels under certain
conditions.9−18 Presently, blends of n-heptane, isooctane, and
toluene (methylbenzene in some works), known as toluene primary reference
fuel (TPRF), are widely applied to mimick the behaviors of gasoline
in a lot of researches.13−18

ASTM D2699 (for RON) and ASTM D2700 (for MON) provide the
standard
methods for determining the ON of fuels, which are rigorous and complicated
experiments conducted with ON testers by means of the procedure settings
in the two standards.6−8 Besides the standard methods, several electrochemical,
chromatographic, and spectroscopic methods have been proposed19−21 for the determination of ON. Although these methods were simpler
than ASTM standard methods, experimentally determining the ON of fuels,
by and large, is inefficient and sometimes dangerous.5,9,22−24 It is still
necessary to set up more reliable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective
methodologies for determining the ON of fuels. Therefore, the quantitative
structure–property relationship (QSPR) technique, which is
convenient and cost-effective for predicting the property of chemical
substances, has gained much attention in fuel researches, in an effort
to reduce the testing burden. A range of QSPR models trying to correlate
the ON of fossil fuels’ component compounds, including paraffin,
naphthene, and olefins, to basic physical and chemical parameters
have been reported.24−27 QSPR studies on blending systems of fuels, such as primary reference
fuels and TPRF, have gained much attention, whereas QSPR models based
on molecular structures of fuel components are rarely reported.

The electrotopological state (E-state) index is an atomic-level
chemometric topological index in which both electronic characteristics
and topological environment in a molecule of each non-hydrogen atom
are encoded together.28−33 Because E-state index is able to encode the structural information
about the valence electronic structure of an atom as well as its presence
in the topological network of a molecule, it is effectual to recognize
atoms or molecular fragments that have a significant influence on
the molecular property. Moreover, the E-state index is easy to calculate
and present. It is able to concisely and conveniently encode molecular
structures. At present, the E-state index has shown its comprehensive
and promising usage in QSPR studies.

This paper, therefore,
investigated and proposed the QSPR models
associating the ON of TPRF with the component composition and molecular
structure of TPRF. The E-state index was utilized as the structural
descriptor of n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene.
It is, of course, the independent variable of the regression model.
The partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to develop the
calibration model between the E-state index and ON of TPRF. The proposed
models can be used to forecast the ON of TPRF, only demanding the
structure and the mole composition of each component in TPRF.

2.2 Construction, Validation, and Evaluation of
the Calibration Model
2.2.1 Partial Least Squares
PLS is a
widely used multivariate calibration technique that allows to mathematically
relate the response variables (dependent variables), Y, with the explanatory variables (independent variables), X. The general idea behind PLS is to try to find the multidimensional
direction in the space of the X matrix that explains
the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the space of the Y matrix. In PLS, the decomposition of explanatory variables X, X = TPT, and the decomposition
of response variables Y, Y = UQT, are performed simultaneously. Herein, T, U, P, and Q are generally
denoted as the matrix of X-scores (also known as latent
variables, LVs), Y-scores, X-loadings, and Y-loadings, respectively. The basic strategy of PLS is that Y should be taken into account for constructing T so as to maximize the covariance between T and U. The LVs are orthogonal to each other, and their number
is equal to the rank of X. Hence, PLS outputs the matrix
of regression coefficients B as well as T, U, P, and Q and gets the
regression model Y = UQT = TBQT = XPBQT by performing
regression between T and U. Because PLS
considers both the outer relation (X and Y matrix individually) and inner relation (correlating the X and Y matrix) in the model construction, it could lead
to a maximum correlation between T and U. Due to its basic strategy, sometimes PLS is called “projection
to latent structures”.

PLS is a good alternative to classical
multivariate calibration techniques, such as multiple linear regression
(MLR) and principal component regression (PCR).34−36 The prediction
performance of PLS is usually better than that of MLR and PCR. The
advantages of PLS include: (a) it can overcome the multicollinearity
of original data, (b) it can keep useful information in the calibration
variables while keeping out redundant information in the calibration
variables, (c) it is distributional free, and (d) it can be applied
to small data sets even if the number of samples is less than the
number of variables.

2.2.2 Validation Approaches
LOO-CV is
commonly utilized to estimate the forecasting performance and robustness
of a multivariable regression model.37 In
practice, the regression task is always on the basis of limited available
samples. The idea of LOO-CV is to utilize all the available samples
to assess the regression model. The advantage of LOO-CV over other
random sub-sampling techniques is that each sample is used for validation
exactly once. When performing LOO-CV with a data set containing n samples, there are n corresponding cycles
in the whole validation procedure. Each cycle i (i = 1, ..., n), comprises 4 steps: (1)
taking sample i out as temporary the “test
set”, which does not participate in the establishment of the
regression model; (2) building up a regression model with the rest
(n – 1) samples; (3) validating the obtained
model with sample i by computing the prediction error;
and (4) after testing the obtained model with the n samples in turn, computing the prediction error for the whole data
set.

As a traditional validation algorithm, the external test
set validation38,39 has been widely used to estimate
the forecast accuracy of calibration models. This algorithm assigns
all the available samples of the whole working data set into a calibration
set (or training set) and a test set. Usually, the samples in the
two subsets are randomly selected from the whole working data set.
The calibration set plays the role of building up the regression model.
The test set is designed to give an independent assessment of the
forecast ability of the model. Hence, the test set cannot participate
in the model development, and thus, it is thoroughly independent from
the calibration set.

There is always the risk of overestimating
the predictive performance
of a regression model in any validation method. Hence, the external
test set validation and LOO-CV are often used together in order to
reduce the risk of overestimation. When performing both external test
set validation and LOO-CV jointly with a data set, usually, the whole
data set is divided into a calibration set and a test set in order
to carry out the external test set validation. After that, all the
samples of the calibration set are predicted in turn so as to complete
the LOO-CV.40−42

2.2.3 Statistics and Applicability
Domain of the
Calibration Model
Root mean squared relative error (RMSRE),
root mean squared error (RMSE), and concordance correlation coefficient
(CCC)43−46 were employed collectively to assess the forecasting performance
of the obtained models. Equations 1 and 2 show the definition of
RMSRE and RMSE 1   2  where REi denotes
the prediction relative error of the ith sample,
AEi denotes the absolute error of the ith sample, and n is the number of samples.

The calculation of CCC is shown in eq 3 3  

In eq 3, yi and ŷi represent the observed and predicted ON value of
each sample, respectively; y̅ and  are the
mean value of the observed and
predicted ON, respectively; and nEXT denotes
the number of samples in the external test set. PRESS denotes the
predictive error sum of squares, and TSS represents the total sum
of squares for the whole data set. The advantage of CCC is that it
is more stable and precautionary than rm2, Q2, and the Golbraikh–Tropsha
method. When different validation measures are discordant or in conflict
for assessing QSPR models, CCC would help in making the decision of
whether or not to accept the developed models.

Applicability
domain (AD) is a theoretical region that is applied
for estimating the uncertainty of a calibration model on the basis
of the considered data of the training set.47 Williams plot is one of the most popular distance-based approaches
to display the AD of a calibration model.48 In Williams plot, the leverage value of the whole data set is calculated
according to eq 4 4  where X is the matrix of the
descriptor, and XT is the transposed X. The leverage value of the ith sample is
the diagonal elements of H, hii. The leverage value of a sample greater than the
critical value h* indicates that this sample is likely
to differ from other samples and be located outside the optimum sample
space. The h* value is calculated according to eq 5 5  where p is the number
of
descriptors in the QSPR model (namely, the number of independent variables
in the regression model), and n is the number of
samples utilized in building the model.

2.2.4 E-State
Index
The detailed theory
of the E-state index has been described in several articles;28−31 this section thereby presents only a brief outline of this topological
index.

When calculating the E-state index of a molecule, the
topological graph (also known as a geometric graph) of the molecule
is generated and used. In the molecular topological graph, one non-hydrogen
atom is regarded as a point of this graph and one chemical bond is
considered an edge of this graph. Each atom of the molecule is encoded
by the terms of the E-state index. Both the intrinsic valence electronic
state of an atom and the electronic influence, which is perturbed
by the context of the topological character of the molecule, of all
other atoms in the molecule on that atom are considered and quantified
within the E-state index. Each term of the E-state index for an atom
consists of an intrinsic value for the atom (in its valence state)
and a value for its perturbation by the other atoms of the molecule. Equation 6 defines the intrinsic
value for a non-hydrogen atom 6  

In eq 4, N indicates the principal quantum number for the valence shell of
the atom. Items δV and δ indicate the connectivity
values. Equations 7 and 8 show the calculations for δV and
δ, respectively. 7  where σ denotes the number
of electrons
in σ orbits of the atom and h denotes the number
of hydrogen atoms linked to the atom by chemical bonds. 8  where ZV, π,
and n denote the number of valence electrons, the
number of electrons in π orbits, and the number of electrons
in lone pairs, respectively.

Equation 9 shows the
calculation for the E-state index (Si) for an atom i in the molecule 9  where rij denotes the nearest relative distance, which is regarded as
1 between the two adjacent non-hydrogen atoms, between the ith and jth atom in the topological graph
plus 1. m represents the amount of non-hydrogen atoms
in the molecule. Then, Si is summed up for each type of atom. All the terms of Si comprise the complete E-state index.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Description
of the TPRF Samples
The
E-state index values of n-heptane, isooctane, and
toluene, which were computed according to the approach described in Section 2.2.4, are listed
in Table 2. As shown
in Table 2, the value
of the E-state index can differentiate the three compounds. Building
a QSPR model related to the three compounds on the basis of the E-state
index should be reasonable.

Table 2 E-State Index of n-Heptane, Isooctane, and Toluene
compound	SaaCH	SsCH3	SaasC	SssCH2	SsssCH	SssssC	
n-heptane	0	4.4914	0	7.0086	0	0	
isooctane	0	11.3924	0	1.3264	0.8426	0.5220	
toluene	10.2616	2.0833	1.3218	0	0	0	
Nevertheless, directly employing
the E-state index of the three
compounds as independent variables to build the QSPR model of these
samples is unreasonable, because this index could not describe the
content of each component in the samples. It is always important to
reduce the risk of chance correlation by building QSPR models with
adequate chemical information. The weight-summed E-state index of
the three components were proposed and calculated to describe the
investigated samples. The computation of weight-summed E-state index
was done according to eq 10 10  where Sm,i are the items of the weight-summed
E-state index; S1,i, S2,I, and S3,i indicate the E-state index of the
three compounds (components)
in a TPRF sample; and c1, c2, and c3 denote the mole
fraction of the three components in a TPRF sample. The weight-summed
E-state index Sm,i of the studied TPRF samples is listed in Table S1. Since Sm,i can quantitatively
describe the chemical composition and structure of each sample to
some extent, using it as the descriptor of TPRF to build the QSPR
model of these samples should be practicable. The quantitative relationship
between ON, including RON and MON, and the weight-summed E-state index
of the investigated samples was studied.

3.2 RON Model
3.2.1 Development and Validation of the PLS Model
PLS was
used to model the quantitative relationship between the
E-state index and RON of the investigated samples. The weight-summed
E-state index, Sm,i, was used as an independent variable and the RON value was
used as a dependent variable to build the regression model. Two validation
techniques, external test set validation and leave-one-out cross-validation,
were carried out to assess the forecasting capacity of the developed
model. The 47 TPRF samples were randomly assigned to two subsets:
Subset R1, which comprises 38 samples (listed in Table 1), and Subset R2, which includes
9 samples (listed in Table 1 and marked bya).

First, the
external test set validation was carried out. Subset R1 was used as
a calibration set to build the regression model. The correlation coefficients
between the six terms of the weight-summed E-state index were first
considered. Table 3 lists the calculated correlation coefficients. From the correlation
coefficients shown in Table 3, it can be concluded that there is a severe inter-correlation
in the data set of the weight-summed E-state index. For instance,
the correlation coefficient between SaaCH and SaasC has reached 1,
which means a completely linear correlation. Moreover, the correlation
coefficients also indicate that the linear correlation between SsCH3 and SsssCH, SsCH3 and SssssC, has reached a high
extent. Thus, PLS was employed to build the regression model in order
to overcome the inter-correlation among the E-state index terms and
exclude the redundant information in the E-state index. According
to the RMSECV shown in Figure S1 and Table S2, and the percentage variance captured
by the PLS model listed in Table S3, it
is obvious that the first two LVs, LV1 and LV2, should be included
in the regression model. Then, a two-latent-variable PLS model was
built and the RON value of the 9 samples in Subset R2 was predicted
by using the developed model. The result is shown in Table 1. The plot of predicted RON
versus observed RON is shown in Figure 1a. For the 9 samples, the RMSRE, RMSE, and CCC of prediction
are, respectively, 1.04, 0.74, and 0.9989. The correlation coefficient
(R) between the predicted and observed RON is 0.9991,
and the linear relationship between the predicted and observed RON
is: RONpred = 0.9800 × RONobs + 1.6620.
Secondly, LOO-CV was conducted by predicting the RON value of the
38 samples of Subset R1 in turn, and the result is shown in Table 1. The plot of predicted
RON versus observed RON is shown in Figure 1a. For the 38 samples, the RMSRE of prediction
is 1.18 and the RMSE of prediction is 0.84. The correlation coefficient
between the predicted and observed RON is 0.9992, and the linear relationship
between the predicted and observed RON is: RONpred = 0.9987
× RONobs + 0.1086. As shown in Figure 1a and Table 1, the predicted RON is in good agreement with the observed
RON.

The Williams plot of this model is displayed in Figure 2a. This plot reveals
that,
in the leverage value, no sample of the 47 samples exceeds the threshold
value h* = 0.5526. It is demonstrated that building
and testing the model with these samples is reasonable and reliable.
It is also revealed by Figure 2a that all the samples except for sample 2 are located within
the threshold range of the standard residual (−3, 3). It is
indicated that sample 2 is a potential response outlier in this model.
Fortunately, the prediction RE of this sample is merely 2.75%, which
usually means a satisfactory prediction accuracy for a QSPR model.
It is demonstrated that the developed PLS model based on this data
set should be acceptable.

(b) MLR model (h* = 0.2368), (c) Scheffé model1
(h* = 0.8684), (d) Scheffé model2 (h* = 0.3158). “▲” indicates the samples
of Subset R1; “▼” indicates the samples of Subset
R2.

Generally speaking, the results
of the two validations demonstrate
that the weight-summed E-state index quantitatively relates to the
RON value of these samples. It is reasonable to employ the weight-summed
E-state index as a descriptor to establish the QSPR model for the
RON of these samples. The PLS method is able to model the relationship
between the weight-summed E-state index and RON of these samples.
The QSPR model developed by PLS can be applied for predicting and
studying the RON of TPRF.

3.2.2 Comparison with Other
Methods
Three
models, one MLR model and two Scheffé models, for predicting
RON of the investigated samples were built. The MLR model correlates
RON and the weight-summed E-state index of these samples by using
a stepwise regression. Scheffé model1 and Scheffé model2
were built with the Scheffé polynomials method proposed in
ref (9). The mole fractions
of n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene, which were,
respectively, denoted as x1, x2, and x3, were used as the
independent variables of Scheffé models. The prediction capacity
of these models was also assessed by the external test set validation
and LOO-CV. In the external test set validation, Subsets R1 and R2
were, respectively, used as the calibration set and the test set.
The RON value of Subset R1 was predicted in turn in the LOO-CV. The
predicted and observed RONs are shown in Figure 1 and Table S4.
The Williams plot of these models is displayed in Figure 2.

When building the MLR
model, the “Use probability of F value”
parameter of the stepwise regression was set to 0.05 for entry and
0.10 for removal. The result of the stepwise regression suggests that
two terms of the weight-summed E-state index, SsCH3 and
SssCH2, should be included in the model as independent
variables. The prediction result of the external test set validation
is: RMSRE = 1.04, RMSE = 0.74, CCC = 0.9989, and RONpred = 0.9793 × RONobs + 1.7107 (R =
0.9991). The result of LOO-CV is: RMSRE = 1.20, RMSE = 0.84, and RONpred = 0.9988 × RONobs + 0.1051 (R = 0.9991). Scheffé model1 includes 10 terms; that is, the
regression model has 10 independent variables: x1, x2, x3, x1x2, x1x3, x2x3, x1x2(x1 – x2), x1x3(x1 – x3), x2x3(x2 – x3), and x1x2x3. The prediction result of the external test set validation
is: RMSRE = 0.80, RMSE = 0.69, CCC = 0.9991, and RONpred = 0.9983 × RONobs – 0.2812 (R = 0.9994). For LOO-CV, RMSRE = 0.83, RMSE = 0.75, and RONpred = 0.9972 × RONobs + 0.2435 (R =
0.9994). Scheffé model2 employed three first-order terms, x1, x2, and x3, as the independent variables. The prediction
result of the external test set validation is: RMSRE = 1.04, RMSE
= 0.74, CCC = 0.9989, and RONpred = 0.9804 × RONobs + 1.6402 (R = 0.9990). For LOO-CV, RMSRE
= 1.25, RMSE 0.89, and RONpred = 0.9991 × RONobs + 0.0738 (R = 0.9991). As shown in Figures 1, 2 and Table S4, the PLS model is
slightly better than the MLR model in the prediction performance.
Scheffé model1 is better than the other three models. However,
Scheffé model1 employed too many independent variables, which
may increase the risk of un-robustness. The prediction performance
of Scheffé model2 is lower than that of other models.

3.3 MON Model
3.3.1 Development and Validation
of the PLS Model
Herein, the PLS method was used to model
the quantitative relationship
between the E-state index and MON of the investigated samples. Similarly,
the weight-summed E-state index Sm,i was used as the independent variable and
the MON value was used as the dependent variable to build the regression
model. The external test set validation and LOO-CV were carried out
to assess the prediction performance of the developed model. The 45
TPRF samples (samples 1–44 and sample 46 listed in Table 1) were assigned to
two subsets: Subset M1, which includes 36 samples (listed in Table 1), and Subset M2,
which comprises 9 samples (listed in Table 1 and marked bya).

In the external test set validation, a two-latent-variable PLS
model was built up by using Subset M1 as the calibration set. The
correlation coefficients shown in Table 4 indicate that there is still a severe inter-correlation
in the data set of the weight-summed E-state index. Figure S2, Tables S2 and S5 demonstrate that LV1 and LV2 should be contained
in the regression model. The MON value of Subset M2 was predicted
with this model. The result is listed in Table 1 and Figure 3a. The RMSRE, RMSE, and CCC of this prediction are
2.25, 1.96, and 0.9913, respectively. The relationship between the
predicted and observed MON is: MONpred = 0.9433 ×
MONobs + 4.3503, with R = 0.9928. In LOO-CV,
the MON value of the 36 samples of Subset M1 was predicted in turn.
The prediction results are listed in Table 1 and Figure 3a. The RMSRE and RMSE of prediction are 2.05 and 1.72.
The relationship between the predicted and observed MON is: MONpred = 0.9907 × MONobs + 0.7120, with R = 0.9940. As shown in the external test set validation
and LOO-CV, the predicted MON is in good agreement with the observed
MON. Figure 4a is the
Williams plot of this model. This plot indicates that the 45 samples
are all located under the threshold leverage value of h* = 0.5833 and within the threshold range of standard residual (−3,
3). It is indicated that there are no response outliers in this model,
and the model building and validating is reasonable.

On the whole, the two validations demonstrate that
the weight-summed
E-state index is quantitatively related to the MON value of these
samples. It is reasonable to use the weight-summed E-state index as
the descriptor to establish the QSPR model for the MON of these samples.
Moreover, the PLS method is able to model the relationship between
the weight-summed E-state index and MON of these samples. The QSPR
model herein is available and promising for forecasting the MON of
TPRF.

3.3.2 Comparison with Other Methods
The
MLR model, Scheffé model1, and Scheffé model2 for predicting
the MON of the investigated samples were established. The MLR model
is built with a stepwise regression method (setting “Use probability of F value” to 0.05 for entry and
0.10 for removal) by utilizing the weight-summed E-state index of
independent variables. Scheffé model1, which includes 10 independent
variables—x1, x2, x3, x1x2, x1x3, x2x3, x1x2(x1 – x2), x1x3(x1 – x3), x2x3(x2 – x3), and x1x2x3—and Scheffé
model2, which uses x1, x2 and x3 as independent variables,
were developed with the Scheffé polynomials method. Herein, x1, x2, and x3 still, respectively, indicate the mole fractions
of n-heptane, isooctane, and toluene. These models
were also assessed by the external test set validation and LOO-CV.
In the external test set validation, Subset M1 and Subset M2 were
used, respectively, as the calibration set and test set. The MON value
of Subset M1 was predicted in LOO-CV. The predicted and observed MONs
are shown in Figure 3 and Table S6. The Williams plots of these
models are displayed in Figure 4.

The independent variables of the MLR model are SsCH3 and SssCH2. The prediction result of the external
test set validation is: RMSRE = 2.24, RMSE = 1.95, CCC = 0.9914, and
MONpred = 0.9430 × MONobs + 4.3584 (R = 0.9929). For LOO-CV, RMSRE = 2.06, RMSE = 1.7,2 and
MONpred = 0.9908 × MONobs + 0.7113 (R = 0.9940). The external test set validation result of
Scheffé model1 is: RMSRE = 1.95, RMSE = 1.35, CCC = 0.9960,
and MONpred = 0.9929 × MONobs –
0.0947 (R = 0.9970). The LOO-CV result of Scheffé
model1 is: RMSRE = 2.56, RMSE = 1.18, and MONpred = 0.9862
× MONobs + 1.1654 (R = 0.9972). The
external test set validation result of Scheffé model2 is: RMSRE
= 2.28, RMSE = 1.98, CCC = 0.9911, and MONpred = 0.9440
× MONobs + 4.3286 (R = 0.9925). The
LOO-CV result of Scheffé model2 is: RMSRE = 2.07, RMSE = 1.74,
and MONpred = 0.9903 × MONobs + 0.7338
(R = 0.9938). As shown in Figures 3, 4 and Table S6, there are no significant differences
between the PLS model and MLR model in the prediction performance.
According to the external test set validation, it seems that Scheffé
model1 might be better than the other three models. However, as shown
in Table S6, the predict error of sample
46 is obviously larger than that of the other three models and other
samples. And the standard residual shown in Figure 4 demonstrates that this sample is a response
outliers. That is, Scheffé model1 might be un-robust. Building
the QSPR model with this method may not be the most reliable choice.
In addition, the prediction performance of Scheffé model2 is
slightly lower than that of the PLS model. The comparison results
demonstrate that employing the E-state index as descriptors and building
the regression model with PLS is better than the Scheffé polynomials
method to develop the MON model of TPRF.

4 Conclusions
The proposed method is feasible and easy to
use for correlating
the ON of TPRF and the structure of TPRF components. In this method,
the weight-summed E-state index is used as a descriptor of TPRF and
PLS regression is used as a calibration method to establish the QSPR
models of TPRF. The results of external test validation and LOO-CV
indicate that the two obtained QSPR models are practicable for predicting
the RON and MON of these samples. It is demonstrated that there is
a quantitative relationship between the chemical composition, represented
by the structure and mole fraction of the components, and the ON of
TPRF. In addition, the comparison of the developed PLS, MLR, and Scheffé
models shows that the PLS models are slightly better than MLR and
Scheffé models in their prediction performance. Generally speaking,
the combination of the weight-summed E-state index and PLS regression
should be a practicable and promising method for studying the QSPR
model of the ON of multi-component fuels, such as TPRF.
