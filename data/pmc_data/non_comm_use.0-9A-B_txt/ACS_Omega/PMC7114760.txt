Using the ionic self-assembly (ISA) strategy to combine Eu-containing
polyoxometalates (Eu-POMs) and organic molecules mainly through noncovalent
electrostatic interactions can protect Eu-POMs from solvent quenching
of luminescence and enhance their processability. For this reason,
a cationic polyelectrolyte, branched polyethyleneimine (PEI), and
a Eu-POM, Na9(EuW10O36)·32H2O (EuW10), were used here to construct luminescence-enhanced
spherical aggregates with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 nm. At
a fixed concentration of EuW10, the phase behavior and
luminescence properties of the mixture could be modulated by the PEI
concentration. Such ISA-induced aggregates could effectively shield
water molecules and result in better photophysical properties. Compared
to bare EuW10, the absolute quantum yield and lifetime
of luminescence for aggregates increased 10 and 5 times, respectively.
Meanwhile, the sensitivity of the EuW10 coordination structure
to the environment made it possible for obtained aggregates being
used to detect either copper cations or permanganate anions due to
their strong specific quenching effects to luminescence. Such a new
type of luminescent soft material not only provided a reference for
exploring the luminescence enhancement mechanism of lanthanide through
self-assembly in aqueous solution but also exhibited potential in
detection by luminescence analysis.

1 Introduction
Owing to the remarkable optical properties such as excellent monochromaticity,
large Stokes shifts, long lifetimes, and high quantum yields, research
for lanthanide-containing luminescent materials have attracted much
attention for decades.1,2 Meanwhile, polyoxometalates (POMs),
a class of inorganic metal oxide clusters with a wide diversity of
compositions and topologies, have been adopted to prepare multifunctional
materials owing to their distinctive catalytic ability and photoelectric
characteristics.3−5 As a kind of inorganic ligand, they can accommodate
lanthanides to improve their luminescence performance.6,7 Molecularly defined Eu-containing polyoxometalates (Eu-POM) with
intriguing functionalities such as luminescence, magnetic, and catalytic
properties are ideal luminescent building blocks, and more and more
attention has been focused on them.8,9

However, the application of Eu-POMs in the luminescent field is
restricted due to the poor processability in their solid state and
the intensive quenching effect by solvent molecules, especially in
aqueous solution. Fortunately, using the ionic self-assembly (ISA)
strategy, which combines Eu-POMs and organic molecules such as cationic
surfactants, biomolecules, or polymers, through noncovalent bonds
(mainly electrostatic interactions) can efficiently protect the POMs
from solvent quenching.10−12 In addition, such formed hybrids
can further act as building blocks to assemble into novel materials
with highly ordered supramolecular nanostructure and novel integrating
functions, such as liquid crystals, gels, vesicles, and nanospheres.12−20 Compared to materials formed through covalent bonds, the ISA strategy
can create versatile self-assemblies by a facile fabrication process.
For examples, Zhang et al. assembled the hybrid of an inorganic polytungstomolybdate,
K13[Eu(SiW9Mo2O39)2] and a quaternary ammonium salt into thermotropic and lyotropic
liquid crystals with strong photoluminescence.14 Wu et al. used a double-chain cationic surfactant (DDAB)
to encapsulate a rare-earth heteropolyacid salt (Na9EuW10O36·32H2O) by electrostatic interactions
at the isoelectric point. The obtained complex could self-assemble
in an ethanol solvent to form a reverse onion phase, which was rearranged
then in aqueous solution to obtain vesicles.21 Using Eu-POM and an ISA strategy, we have also fabricated various
aggregates such as nanobelts and nanospheres with enhanced luminescence
and multiple responsiveness.13,15 Except for small organic
molecules, the positively charged block copolymers can also participate
in such an electrostatic self-assembly. Wan et al. selected a hydrophilic
copolymer with a cationic block, which could interact with Eu-POM
to form a stable micelle-like nanostructure to show enhanced luminescence.12 Similarly, using a triblock copolymer and Eu-POM,
they successfully assembled a hydrogel with enhanced luminescence
and self-healing properties.16

Therefore, selection of the cationic component often determines
the final hybrid properties. Though either small molecules or polymers
have adopted for such ISA assemblies, the specially designed organic
components often need time-consuming synthesis with high costs, which
might restrain their practical applications. Thus, the environmentally
friendly and facile approaches using accessible polyelectrolytes are
of great significance and become more and more attractive. For example,
Bu et al. prepared POM-based nanofibers and nanosheets using cationic
polyelectrolytes such as PAH, PDDA, and PXTT with the aggregate morphology
dependent on molecular conformations of polyelectrolytes.22 In addition, the poly(ionic liquid),23 polymeric quaternary ammonium salts,24 and polyviologens25 were also used to prepare hybrid nanostructures through ionic self-assembly
with polyoxometalate clusters. Except for these polyelectrolytes,
polyethyleneimine (PEI) is unique and can be protonated or ionized
in water to carry positive charges with a tunable amount upon addition
of an acid or base. The charge distribution of different amine groups
and the conformation of PEI are therefore controllable. Due to these
characteristics, the silver nanoclusters capped by hyperbranched PEI
have been used as fluorescent and colorimetric pH sensors.26 Besides, PEI itself is suitable to participate
and control ISA processes. For example, the luminescent nanospheres
or nanovesicles could be fabricated from PEI and silver nanoclusters.
After adding the acid, the nanovesicles were induced to break and
therefore resulted in a luminescent intensity decrease of silver nanoclusters.27

Motivated by these strategies, we here report the ion self-assembly
between a positively charged PEI and a negatively charged decatungsteuropate
(Na9EuW10O36·32H2O, EuW10), which possesses better luminescence performance
among other luminescent POMs.28 To our
best knowledge, a study using polyelectrolytes and lanthanide-containing
heteropolyacid salts in ion self-assembly is rarely reported. By such
a combination, the well-defined nanospheres with enhanced luminescence
and stimuli responsiveness have been fabricated, which exhibit application
potential for detection by luminescence analysis. Moreover, this research
represented a convenient strategy for constructing Eu-POM-based nanomaterials
with responsiveness.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Formation of PEI/EuW10 Spherical
Aggregates
At a fixed EuW10 concentration (CEu) of 40 μM, the aggregate formation
of a PEI/EuW10 ISA hybrid was first investigated. Figure 1a,b presents typical
sample visual photographs with increasing the PEI concentration (CPEI) and corresponding solution phases, respectively.
As can be seen, the solution status was gradually changed from initially
clear and transparent to with precipitates and finally became stably
colloidal as confirmed by obvious Tyndall effects (Figure 1c), indicating the formation
of nanosized aggregates. As a comparison, however, no Tyndall effect
could be observed for PEI or EuW10 aqueous solutions at
the same concentrations, reflecting no aggregates present perhaps
because they were both highly water-soluble. Therefore, the interaction
between PEI and EuW10 might provide new building blocks
to drive aggregate formation.

Figure 1 (a) Visual sample photos at fixed 40 μM EuW10 but
different CPEI values (μM) and (b)
corresponding solution phases, accompanied by (c) three typical photos
to check the Tyndall effect for PEI, EuW10, and PEI/EuW10 solutions.

To characterize the morphology and size of formed aggregates, TEM
and SEM observations have been done. Figure 2 presents obtained images for three samples
at different CPEI values. As can be seen
from them, the spherical aggregates of high contrast could be found
with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 nm, which were dependent on CPEI. Among the three samples, at a relatively
low CPEI = 0.056 μM, the globular
aggregates with an average diameter of 50 nm were found to adhere
to each other (Figure 2a,b). Increasing CPEI to 0.064 μM
resulted in more scattered and larger nanospheres with the size at
around 100–200 nm (Figure 2c). Further increasing CPEI to 0.08 μM, however, the size of spherical aggregates was
much reduced (Figure 2d). The DLS data shown by insets in Figure 2 provided aggregate diameter distributions,
showing larger values than those observed by TEM or SEM due to the
presence of hydration layers. The components in the aggregate were
identified by energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy measurement with the result shown in Figure S1 where the elements of tungsten, europium,
oxygen, and nitrogen were detected, which could be considered as evidence
of successful hybridization of EuW10 clusters with PEI.

values: CPEI = 0.056 (a, b), 0.064 (c),
and 0.08 (d). Inset curves in (a), (c), and (d) are corresponding
DLS data.

2.2 Formation Mechanism of PEI/EuW10 Spherical Aggregates
What causes the formation of PEI/EuW10 aggregates? For ISA assembly, the electrostatic interaction
between PEI and EuW10 was naturally thought as the dominant
driving force. To confirm this point, the zeta potential (ζ)
change as a function of CPEI was measured
and is shown in Figure 3a. With increasing CPEI, the ζ
value was found to gradually elevate from negative (−33.4 mV)
to positive, which clearly suggested the neutralization of negatively
charged EuW10 by the protonated PEI.20 When CPEI reached 0.024 μM,
the aggregate started to form and the ζ value approached +23
mV, which indicated that there existed protonated amino groups of
PEI outside the aggregates to make them stable in water. With further
increasing CPEI, however, the ζ
value was basically unchanged. This phenomenon could be reasoned to
the decrease of the PEI ionization degree when CPEI increased.

Figure 3 (a) Zeta potential change as a function of CPEI and (b) FTIR spectra for EuW10, PEI, or the
PEI/EuW10 hybrid at 0.064 μM of CPEI.

To further characterize the intermolecular interactions between
PEI and EuW10, FT-IR spectra were measured for the two
components and their hybrid with the results shown in Figure 3b. It can be seen that PEI
exhibited symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of CH2 at 2824 and 2940 cm–1 from its alkyl chains,
which remained and changed after forming the hybrid with EuW10, indicating the presence of PEI in aggregates. Meanwhile, the peaks
at 1650 and 1579 cm–1 in the PEI spectrum were related
to N–H bending vibrations from primary and secondary amino
groups, respectively. These two bands were weakened and even disappeared
after forming aggregates, which was attributed to the electrostatic
and hydrogen-bond interactions between amino groups of PEI and EuW10. For the EuW10 spectrum, four characteristic
vibration peaks at 943, 843, and 787 and 704 cm–1 originated from ν(W=Od), ν(W–Ob–W), and ν(W–Oc–W) were
identified where Ob was the bridged oxygen of two octahedra
sharing a corner, Oc represented the bridged oxygen of
two octahedra sharing an edge, and Od was the terminal
oxygen. These peaks still remained in the hybrid spectrum but shifted
to 923, 815, 764, and 676 cm–1, demonstrating that
the EuW10 polyanion was integrated in aggregates through
electrostatic interactions and their chemical structure was not destroyed.
Moreover, the reduced ν(W=Od) indicated that
the bond length of W=Od was slightly elongated.5,29 Considering that the POM could act as proton acceptors for hydrogen
bonds, we could conclude that the terminal oxygen ligand participated
in the formation of hydrogen bonds between EuW10 and PEI.

Then, how did PEI bind EuW10 together to form aggregates?
To reply to this question, the energetics for the interaction between
EuW10 and PEI were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) measurement. As shown in Figure S2, a calorimetric heat flow trace (Figure S2A) and a binding isotherm (Figure S2B)
were obtained by injecting 300 μL of PEI (0.09 μM) into
1.4 mL of EuW10 (18 μM) solution at 25 °C. Though
the binding process was relatively complicated and no appropriate
binding model could be used to fit the experimental binding isotherm
to get the thermodynamic parameters, the observed exothermicity indicated
that the electrostatic interaction was one of the dominated forces
during the aggregate formation. The isotherm also suggested that PEI
might possess more than one site for EuW10, indicating
the existence of other interactions except for the electrostatic interaction.30 This phenomenon could be explained from the
structure of branched PEI in which the amine distribution was approximately
25% primary, 50% secondary, and 25% tertiary with corresponding pKa values of 9, 8, and 6–7, respectively.31,32 Under our experimental conditions, the sample pH ranged between
7.5 and 8.5, indicating that there were unprotonated primary and secondary
amino groups to provide hydrogen-bonding sites for EuW10. Thus, in addition to the electrostatic interaction, the hydrogen
bonding should be also a driving force for aggregate formation. Moreover,
the highly exothermic turning point at the molar ratio of 0.0006 was
coincident with the phase region corresponding to aggregate formation.
This indicated that the interactions between PEI and EuW10 reached a balance to form colloidal aggregates but not precipitates.

Based on the above discussion, the possible mechanism on aggregate
formation and morphology change was proposed. In aqueous solution
with a large amount of protonated amino groups, PEI can behave like
a cationic surfactant to gather the EuW10 anionic cluster
through strong electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding to
form nanospheres. For the aggregates formed at lower CPEI, the sample pH value was lower and the ionization
degree of PEI was higher. The expansion of PEI was easier owing to
the repulsion between charged amine groups. Then, the EuW10 clusters in solution could bridge several PEI chains through electrostatic
and hydrogen-bonding interactions to form adhered aggregates. At elevated CPEI, however, the ionization degree was reduced
and PEI chains were coiled. Several of them were cross-linked by EuW10 clusters to produce larger and more regular aggregates.
When increasing CPEI more, the further
decreased protonation of amino groups made PEI capture EuW10 less, which resulted in the formation of smaller aggregates.

To explore if other polyelectrolytes have similar effects, poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) (PAH, Mw: 15,000) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium)
chloride (PDDA, Mw: 400,000–500,000)
have also been investigated. Even though both of them had amine groups
and could remarkably improve the luminescence performance of EuW10, no aggregates with regular morphology were observed. Compared
to the branched PEI, linear PAH and PDDA with all amino groups positively
charged made the chains more rigid and expanded, which blocked the
formation of aggregates. Obviously, the polyelectrolyte chemical structure
has an important influence on regular aggregate formation, which determines
the balance in between electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and other
interactions.

2.3 Luminescence of PEI/EuW10 Aggregates
To investigate the photophysical properties of PEI/EuW10 aggregates and clarify their relationship to the aggregate structure,
the excitation and emission spectra of various hybrid samples were
determined and are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a displays the excitation spectra for pure EuW10 aqueous
solution and a hybrid sample at CPEI =
0.08 μM. It was found that a wide band appeared in the 200–300
nm region for EuW10 representing the ligand-to-metal charge
transfer (LMCT) transition of O→W in heteropolyoxotungstate,
which acted as ligands for Eu3+.33 The intensity of this band increased much after aggregate formation,
which illustrated that the nonradiative transition of the Eu3+ ion was suppressed. Therefore, as can be seen from the emission
spectra shown in Figure 4b, the luminescence intensity was obviously enhanced upon aggregate
formation, which originated from two aspects. On the one hand, the
interaction of the protonated amino group of PEI with EuW10 effectively shielded the hydrogen bonding between Eu-POM and water
to make the LMCT process more efficient.34 On the other hand, the intramolecular energy transfer in EuW10 is strongly affected by W–O–W and W–O–Eu
bonds. Due to ISA and more close packing of PEI and EuW10, the configuration of heteropolyoxotungstate was thus changed and
therefore so did both bonds. As a result, the energy level of LMCT
was changed and the delocalization of a d1 electron was
decreased, which improved the energy transfer efficiency between LMCT
levels and excited Eu3+ levels.35

and hybrid at CPEI = 0.08 μM. (b)

decay curves of EuW10 (40 μM) and hybrid samples
at different CPEI monitored at 620 nm.

Checking Figure 4b more specifically, for EuW10, we could see five characteristic
emission bands of Eu3+ at 579, 593, 620, 652, and 700 nm,
which originated from the 4f6 electron transitions and
energy release from the 5D0 metastable state
to five terminal levels symbolized as 5D0 → 7Fj (j = 0, 1,
2, 3, 4). The positions of these bands were unchanged in aggregates
except for the pronounced intensity increase at 620 nm. Therefore,
the aggregate samples displayed obvious red luminescence when excited
by UV light, as seen from inset photos in Figure 4b. It was noted that, however, with increasing CPEI, the intensity for 5D0 → 7F2 transition at 620 nm began to
gradually decrease, which was different from the reported luminescence
enhancement for the peptide/EuW10 hybrid when increasing
the peptide concentration.20 We speculated
the reason to the increase of the system pH value, which reduced the
ionization of amino groups.27 As a result,
the hydrogen bonding between nonionized amino groups and EuW10 became stronger, and the luminescence decreased slightly.

In addition, the 5D0 → 7F2 transition at 620 nm is known to correspond to the
electric dipole transition; the intensity of which would increase
as the coordination environment around Eu3+ ions became
more asymmetrical. In aggregates, the strong interaction between PEI
and EuW10 distorted the symmetry of molecule packing and
made the coordination environment around Eu3+ ions more
asymmetrical. As a result, the probability of electrodipole transition
was increased, and the intensity was enhanced. 5D0 → 7F1 at 593 nm was attributed to a
magnetic dipole transition, which was hardly altered even if the chemical
environment in the vicinity of Eu3+ ions was changed. Then,
the ratio of intensity for 5D0 → 7F2 to 5D0 → 7F1, symbolized as k, is normally used
to measure the site symmetry of Eu3+ ions and the monochromaticity.
Then, the obtained k values at different CPEI values are listed in Table S1 where it was found that the formation of aggregates
increased this ratio significantly compared to that of EuW10 aqueous solution, indicating a more asymmetrical environment occupied
by Eu3+ and the enhanced monochromaticity. Considering
the difference in size and electronegativity between the protonated
amino group and the counter Na+ ion of EuW10, the distortion of such a site symmetry of Eu3+ could
be ascribed to the configuration change of heteropolyoxotungstate,
which was induced by the electrostatic interaction between EuW10 and branched PEI.35 With increasing CPEI, the k value was also elevated
and then stabilized at approximately 7, although the emission band
at 620 nm was slightly decreased at higher CPEI due to the pH change. This implied that increasing CPEI more could not further change the asymmetrical
environment occupied by Eu3+ owing to the saturated number
of amine groups interacting with EuW10.

The luminescence decay curves were used to further evaluate Eu3+ coordination structure changes due to interactions with
PEI. The measured data are shown in Figure 4c from which the lifetime (τ) was found
to increase significantly after forming aggregates. This can be easily
understood because the amino groups in the hybrid could shield water
molecules and reduce the coupling between the 5D0 state of Eu3+ and OH oscillators. The nonradiative transition
deactivation process was therefore decreased, and the luminescence
lifetime was extended.34 Moreover, it was
noted that the decay curves changed also from mono-exponential for
free EuW10 to bi-exponential for the hybrid. The lifetimes
and distribution percentages (α) for shorter and longer ones
obtained from the curve fitting are summarized also in Table S1. It can be seen that τ was measured
as 0.24 ms for free EuW10, which, however, was changed
into two values in aggregates (for example, 0.96 and 3.04 ms at CPEI = 0.064 μM), and the average lifetimes
increased for several times. The reason for two lifetimes might be
attributed to different microenvironments or states of Eu3+. The shorter one originated from Eu3+ coupling to water,
while the longer one was assigned to Eu3+ ions, which were
protected from water molecules by amino groups of PEI, suggesting
a reduction in the nonradiative pathway.36 This could be also confirmed from other photophysical parameters
shown in Table S2. Figure 5 shows the mechanism scheme for aggregate
formation and luminescence enhancement based on the discussion above.

Figure 5 Schematic illustration on the mechanism for aggregate formation
and luminescence enhancement.

2.4 Ion Responsiveness of the PEI/EuW10 Spherical Aggregates
Considering the luminescence sensitivity
of lanthanide ions to surrounding environments, it is natural to think
whether the obtained hybrid of PEI and EuW10 is suitable
to fabricate luminescence sensors. Here, we tested the responsiveness
of the hybrid to ions, owing to their essential roles in the environment
and living systems.37 To do so, considering
both the stability of hybrid spheres and the good luminescence intensity
at 620 nm, the aggregate sample at CPEI = 0.064 μM was chosen to monitor its luminescence intensity
change at 620 nm upon adding different anions or cations with the
results shown in Figure 6. It could be seen from Figure 6a,b that the luminescence intensities of aggregates
decreased dramatically after adding copper, iron, cobalt, and nickel
ions, while only slight quenches occurred for other metal ions. Owing
to the essential roles of Cu2+ in living biological systems,
the selectivity and quantitative analysis were extremely important.38 Therefore, we investigated the Cu2+ concentration effect and found that the emission intensity gradually
decreased with increasing Cu2+ content and the intensity
reduction rate was linear in a Cu2+ concentration range
from 0 to 20 μM as shown in Figure S3. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 0.3 μM,
indicating that this hybrid aggregate possessed specific recognition
of copper ions in aqueous solution.

Figure 6 Luminescence spectra comparison for the aggregate at CPEI = 0.064 μM upon adding different (a) cations
and (c) anions, accompanied by (b, d) corresponding intensity sensitivity
changes taken at 620 nm. All the samples were excited at 280 nm, and
the concentration of adding ion was fixed at 200 μM.

To explore the reason for such a specific quenching effect of the
copper ion, we first checked whether the aggregate morphology was
changed by TEM with the results shown in Figure S4. As can be seen from Figure S4a, the original spherical aggregate became cohesive irregular ones,
indicating certain destruction of original packing between PEI and
EuW10. As there are a considerable amine groups on PEI,
Cu2+ ions might be coordinated by PEI to form a PEI–Cu2+ complex.39 However, the aggregates
were maintained except for a certain influence on the morphology,
indicating that only a small part of copper ions interacted with the
non-protonated amine groups. Therefore, there were still excess Cu2+ ions to interact with EuW10. According to previous
research, Cu2+ could reduce the energy transfer efficiency
from the ligand to Eu3+ and thus decrease the luminescence
intensity.40 FT-IR spectra were further
used to confirm such a coordination interaction between EuW10 and Cu2+. Figure S5 presents
the FTIR spectra for aggregates at CPEI = 0.064 μM and in the presence of Cu2+. The existence
of four characteristic peaks of EuW10 indicated that its
structure was still preserved although the bands were slightly shifted
after adding Cu2+.41 The slight
shifts might be ascribed to the coordination interactions among Cu2+ with oxygen atoms, which were on the surface of EuW10.42 In addition, the luminescence
decay curves shown in Figure S6 upon addition
of Cu2+ reflected a luminescence lifetime decrease from
1.24 to 0.66 ms, suggesting an energy transfer between EuW10 and Cu2+. Moreover, as shown in Figure S7, for ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of aggregate
and two ions, no absorption of Cu2+ could be found, indicating
that there is no competition for excitation light energy. Therefore,
the quenching mechanism was considered as the following. The energy
release from the O→W LMCT excited state through the recombination
between the d1 electron and the hole would be blocked by
the Cu2+ coordination interaction. Then, the energy from
the O→W LMCT excited state would be transferred to the coordinated
Cu2+ rather than the 5D0 emitting
state of Eu3+, which induced the Eu3+ emission
switching off.

Figure 6c,d illustrated
that only the permanganate ion showed an appropriate 100% quenching
effect among various anions, indicating high selectivity toward permanganate
ions. From the TEM image shown in Figure S4b, the permanganate ions also turned the aggregate to adhered ones.
It should be mentioned that the amine groups are inclined to be oxidized
by oxidants.43,44 Therefore, the oxidation of PEI
by permanganate ions should be responsible for such an aggregate morphology
change. Then, the deformation of aggregates was a reason for the quenching
effect. FT-IR spectra in Figure S8 illustrated
that the structure of EuW10 was not destroyed after adding
MnO4– because the four characteristic
peaks were still maintained. From Figure S7 of the UV–vis spectrum, there was an overlap of the absorption
range between samples for aggregates at CPEI = 0.064 μM and for MnO4–, demonstrating
that the quenching effect may be also caused by the competitive absorption
of MnO4–, which hampered the energy transfer.45,46 Considering the wide application in industries of permanganate ions
and the serious damage to human health and the environment, this hybrid
material showed possibility of being fluorescent probes for efficiently
detecting permanganate ions in wastewater.

3 Conclusions
In summary, through ionic self-assembly (ISA) by an amine group-rich
polyelectrolyte (PEI) and a Eu-containing POM (EuW10),
the well-defined spherical aggregates were prepared in water to show
much luminescence enhancement. The aggregate morphology and size have
been characterized by TEM, SEM, and DLS measurements. FT-IR spectra,
ζ potential, and ITC profiles proved that the main driving forces
were electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding between PEI and
EuW10. The emission spectra and luminescence decay curves
indicated that the strong binding of PEI excluded surrounding water
from EuW10 and consequently resulted in enhanced luminescence
intensity, longer luminescence lifetime, and higher quantum yields.
Significantly, with such fabricated hybrids, their luminescence intensities
exhibited good responsiveness to some transition metal cations, which
could be used to quantitatively detect copper ions. In addition, the
permanganate anion could obviously quench the luminescence compared
with other common anions due to the competition absorption of ultraviolet
light. The obtained results not only provide a facile method to prepare
colloidal rare-earth luminescent materials but also present the potential
for detection application.

4.2 Sample Preparation
To prepare PEI/EuW10 spherical aggregates, the aqueous solution of EuW10 (40 μL, 3 mM) was injected into PEI aqueous solutions at different
concentrations. The final EuW10 concentration was fixed
at 0.04 mM, while the PEI concentration was changed. Vortex mixing
was used to form a stable colloidal solution containing spherical
aggregates. The obtained samples were equilibrated for 24 h at 25
°C before further characterization.

4.3 Characterization of the Aggregates
4.3.1 Luminescence Spectroscopy
The steady-state
excitation and emission spectra were carried out on a Fluoromax-4
spectrofluorimeter (Horiba, Jobin Yvon). The excitation wavelength
was selected at 280 nm. Time-resolved luminescence decay curves were
monitored on a FLS-920 fluorometer (Edinburgh, Britain). Samples were
contained in quartz cuvettes and a 280 nm ultraviolet light from a
μF920 microsecond flash lamp was used to excite EuW10 and collect the intensity at 618 nm. Using software included in
the instruments, the decay curves can be exponentially fitted and
the lifetime can be calculated.

4.3.2 Dynamic Light Scattering and Zeta Potential
(DLS and ζ Potential)
A Zetasizer Nano-ZS instrument
(ZEN3600, Malvern Instruments, U.K.) was used to do DLS to determine
the size distributions under an incident laser beam at a wavelength
of 632 nm and a constant scattering angle of 173° at 25 ±
0.1 °C. The ζ-potential measurements were also carried
out on this instrument.

4.3.3 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy
(FT-IR)
FT-IR spectra were recorded from 400 to 4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1 using
an Alpha-T spectrometer (Bruker). For the solid powder, a small amount
of it was added into KBr salt, and the well-mixed powder was compressed
into a transparent disk.

4.3.4 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM measurements were performed on a Hitachi 100CX-II transmission
electron microscope operating at 100 kV. The sample was prepared by
putting a drop of the aggregate solution on a carbon-coated copper
grid and removing the excess solution with filter paper after 5 min.
Then, it was dried for 30 min using an infrared lamp.

4.3.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The morphology observation and composition analysis were further
done by SEM and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) on a Hitachi
SU8010 scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage
of 5.0 kV. The sample was placed on a silica wafer, and the wafer
was dried for 30 min with an infrared lamp. Then, the platinum sputter
coating was carried out.

4.3.6 Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments were performed on a MicroCal VP-ITC apparatus.
The PEI aqueous solution in a 300 μL syringe was titrated into
1.4 mL of EuW10 aqueous solution at 25 °C.
