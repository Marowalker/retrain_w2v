Fracture characterization is necessary
to evaluate fracturing operations
and forecast well performance. However, it is challenging to quantitatively
characterize the complex fracture network in shale gas reservoirs
because of the unknown density and reactivation of natural fractures.
The flowback water transients can provide useful information about
the complexity of the fracture network after the fracturing operations.
In this paper, a mathematical model for modeling fracturing fluid
flowback of hydraulically fractured shale gas wells is established.
This proposed model characterizes the flow of water and gas in a hydraulic
fracture-induced natural fracture–shale matrix system. Hydraulic,
capillary, and osmotic convections; gas adsorption; and natural fracture
closure are considered in this model. Flowback simulation of a hydraulically
fractured shale gas well is conducted using the developed numerical
simulator, and the water/gas transients between hydraulic fractures,
natural fractures, and matrix are obtained. Finally, two field cases
from the Longmaxi Formation, Southern Sichuan Basin, China, are used
for comparison of the flowback data with the model results. The good
match of the two water transients provides a group of fracture network
parameters, that is, the effective length and conductivity of main
hydraulic fractures and the density of induced natural fractures.
The proposed model for describing the flowback process and its meaningful
relationship with the fracture–network complexity provides
an alternative approach for post-stimulation evaluation.

1 Introduction
In recent decades, shale
gas development in North America has become
very successful, which is mainly attributed to the technological advancement
of multistage hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells. Fracture characterization
is necessary to evaluate fracturing operations and forecast well performance.
The most common methods for fracture characterization are rate-transient
analysis (RTA), pressure-transient analysis (PTA), micro-seismic analysis,
and tracer test. Many researchers used RTA and PTA to characterize
the fracture network1−7 because production data are available for almost every well. Micro-seismic
monitoring is also broadly used in the field to characterize the fracture
network during and after the hydraulic fracturing operations.8−11 Tracer test is another method commonly used to characterize the
fracture network.12−16 Each of these three methods has its strengths and limitations. No
one method is solid enough to be applicable to all wells, especially
when dealing with field data.

In the past, the flowback data
obtained during the post-stimulation
routine practice for well clean-up are usually ignored. The flowback
models are limited to single-phase water flow in a dual-porosity medium
without considering induced natural fractures, gas-phase permeability,
and fracture closure effects. However, flowback is a multi-phase problem,
without analytical solutions. Numerical simulation and matching seem
to be the only way to deal with this problem.

In 2006, Crafton
and Gunderson17 analyzed
the data of water flowback rate and pressure with high frequency to
obtain fracture length before and after gas breakthrough; later in
2010, a two-dimensional simulator was developed for modeling gas/water
two-phase flow during the flowback.18 In
2012, Clarkson19 extended the multi-phase
RTA method to shale gas reservoirs and developed a single water-phase
analytical model for the flowback process; other effects, including
various fracture geometries, the flow of free gas, pressure-dependent
relative permeability and porosity, communications between fracture
stages and between wells, fracture closure, and the use of nitrogen-energized
fracturing fluid, have been included in later studies.20−23 Clarkson and Williams-Kovacs24 also proposed
the analytical method for tight oil reservoirs; the salinity modeling
and additional constrain on relative permeability curve were considered
later.25 In 2016, Clarkson and Qanbari26 included dynamic drainage area27 into the proposed semianalytical model for modeling flowback,
and fracture propagation was considered.28

Abbasi et al.29 divided the whole
flowback
process into water-dominant period, water decreasing and gas increasing
period, and gas dominant period, and pointed out that the carefully
measured rate and pressure data in the flowback stage supplement production
data analysis for more accurate fracture characterization. In 2013,
Alkouh30 developed a three-dimensional
gas−water two-phase flow model for shale reservoirs and pointed
out that analyzing the combined data of flowback, shut-in and production
provides proper flow regime identification. In 2014, Ezulike and Dehghanpour
developed a flowback analysis model (FAM) for two-phase flow; the
FAM model can be applied to the comprehensive analysis of flowback
and production records;31−33 later in 2016, Ezulike et al.34 included fracture closure in the two-phase flowback
model for obtaining effective fracture pore volume. In 2016, Zolfaghari
et al.35 proposed a model for describing
salt transport during water flowback and to characterize fracture
network through a salinity profile. In 2017, Jia et al.36 introduced complex fracture network to gas−water
two-phase flowback in shale gas reservoirs. In 2018, Zhang and Emami-Meybodi37 developed a gas−water two-phase flow
semianalytical model for analyzing flowback and long-term production
data; fracture closure can be quantified with the use of this model.

In 2014, Adefidipe et al.38 proposed
a mathematical model to characterize instant gas breakthrough and
to obtain fracture parameters by matching gas−water two-phase
flowback data. In 2014, Bertoncello et al.39 provided well management suggestion through shut-in and flowback
simulation. In 2014, Almulhim et al.40 investigated
various effects on water flowback. In 2016, Fakcharoenphol et al.41 simulated fracturing fluid flowback to investigate
how shut-in affects gas produced and water recovery. In 2016, Wang
and Pan42 proposed a chemical potential
dominant flowback model in shale gas reservoirs.

Although many
flowback models17−42 have been published, few of them coupled the transient fluid flow
modeling with important phenomena occurring in the shale gas reservoir,
such as mechanical fracture closure, thermal transfer, and chemical–potential
equilibrium. Because of the limitation of the flowback models, the
results from flowback data analysis cannot provide fracture network
parameters. In this study, an integrated hydro-mechanical–chemical
model (HMC) developed by Wang et al.43 is
used to simulate fracturing fluid flowing back after the hydraulic
fracturing treatment. Two field cases from the Longmaxi Formation,
Southern Sichuan Basin, China, are investigated with the HMC model-based
flowback history matching method. The proposed method aims to provide
an alternative approach for post-stimulation evaluation.

2 Physical Model and Assumptions
The proposed physical model
for loaded fracturing fluid recovery
from a multi-stage hydraulically fractured well in shale gas reservoirs
is shown in Figure 1. In this model, the fractured shale gas reservoir is subdivided
into grid blocks in shale matrix (m), induced natural fractures (f),
and hydraulic fractures (F). In this model, the hydraulic fractures
are ideally set to propped planar fractures and can be characterized
by length (lF), width (wF), and height (hF). The fracturing
fluids flow directly between F and the horizontal wellbore. The grid
blocks for characterizing f overlie those for m, and the flows of
both fracturing fluid and gas occur between the two layers. According
to Gilman and Kazemi44 and Yan et al.,45 the shape factor (α2) can be
converted to natural fracture density (nf). The horizontal wellbore is embedded in F, while the discrete organic
matter is in the inorganic matrix grid, with both regarded as the
sink source terms.

Figure 1 Physical model.

To be specific, in m, clay acts as the surface membrane, so hydraulic
convection, osmotic convection, and capillary imbibition contribute
to the flow of water.46 As the reservoir
pressure decreases during the flowback, the adsorption layer of the
organic matrix desorbs the shale gas. Langmuir equation is used to
characterize gas desorption, which is assumed to be an instantaneous
equilibrium process in the modeling;47,48 there is no
clay contained in f, so we do not consider osmotic pressure as the
driven force for water and salt ion transport,49 and the transport of both water and salt ions in f is driven
by hydraulic pressure and capillary force; the gas transport in both
f and m is induced by hydraulic convection.50 The capillary force is ignored in F because hydraulic fractures
are designed to be high-conductivity propped fractures.51 Hydraulic pressure acts as the only driven force
for both water flow and gas flow in F. Gas transport is regarded as
the high-velocity non-Darcy flow.52 We
assume sodium chloride (NaCl) to be the only dissolved mineral in
fracturing fluids and formation brine. Therefore, advection contributes
to the flow of NaCl in F, f, and m.53,54 Dispersion
and other transport mechanisms have not been included in this model
for the description of salt ion transport.

In the process of
fracturing fluid flowback, water flows into the
horizontal wellbore from F under the hydraulic pressure difference.
Hydraulic, osmotic, and capillary forces induce water flow between
f and m, while only osmotic pressure is not considered in the flow
of water between F and f. Once the flowback process is implemented,
the reservoir pressure decreases, so some of the gas desorbs continuously
from the adsorption layer of the organic matter.55 The whole mass transfer of water, gas, and salt ions is
a continuous process.

3 Mathematical Model
The following fluid flow equations for water and gas in hydraulically
fractured shale reservoirs are based on the above-mentioned physical
model, which was developed by Wang et al.43 for fracturing fluid leakoff simulation. Here, flowback simulation
is applied. The subscript l stands for either w (water) or g (gas),
F for main hydraulic fracture, f for induced natural fracture, and

is, fracture density; τ stands for tortuosity; w and bf represent natural fracture height
and aperture, respectively. w is unity for continuous
fractures.

In eq 5, qlfm stands
for the water/gas flux between f and m (g/cm3·s),
which can be calculated by the following equation 9  where α2 stands for the shape
factor between f and m (cm–2), proposed by Kazemi
et al.,59plm and pc,lm stand
for the water/gas pressure (10–1 MPa) and capillary
force (10–1 MPa) in m, respectively, and pπ, described by Wang and Pan,42 is the osmotic pressure (10–1 MPa) for water, which can be defined as 10  where λ is the membrane efficiency characterizing
the capacity of the clay membrane to allow water molecule pass through; xf stands for the molar fraction of the water

and νlm is the velocity for water/gas (cm/s), which
can be calculated by the following equation 12  where km is the
permeability of m (μm2), krlm stands for the
relative permeability in m (nondimensional), and pπm, only
considered for water phase, is the osmotic pressure in m (10–1 MPa).

In eq 11, mg is the mass of shale gas absorbed
by the organic
matrix under formation condition (g/cm3) and is described
by Silin and Kneafsey60 derived from the
Langmuir isotherm61 13  where ρr and Sk represent the density (g/cm3) and
volume
fraction of source rock, respectively, ρgsc stands
for the density of shale gas at the standard condition (g/cm3), and VL and pL stand for the Langmuir’s volume (cm3/g)

4 Numerical Simulation Model
The simulated well W in
this section is based on a multi-stage
hydraulically fractured well in Marcellus Shale.51,62−66 The lateral length of well W is 1200 m and it is completed with
a 15-stage and 4-cluster per stage hydraulic fracturing treatment.
The fractures are transversely and evenly generated along the horizontal
wellbore in each stage. In addition, the fracture half-length is designed
to be 180 m. The drainage area controlled by well W can be characterized
by the length of 1500 m, the width of 600 m, and the thickness of
42 m. Basic information from this field case is given in Table 1.51,62−66

procedure includes injection for 2 h, shut-in for 5 days, and flowback
for 5 days. Water (10 934 m3) is pumped into the
shale formation. The bottom-hole flowing pressures for injection and

5 Results
and Discussion
5.1 Flowback Simulation
Flowback simulation
has been conducted using the numerical model described above. The
water fluxes from hydraulic fractures to the wellbore (F–W),
from induced natural fractures to hydraulic fractures (f–F)
and the matrix (f–m) during flowback are shown in Figure 2a, while the accumulated
water fluxes of the three directions aforementioned are exhibited
in Figure 2b. The quick
declines of the loaded water flowback rates in all directions can
be observed in Figure 2a, with the water flux of f–m showing a more significant decreasing
trend. The loaded water recovery volume from F to W is 1411 m3 in total, so a recovery ratio of 12.9% can be obtained. It
is worth mentioning that 63 m3 water flowed from f to m
in addition to the majority of water (777 m3) flowed into
F from f. Figure 3 compares
the gas rates and cumulative gas fluxes of the three directions in
the flowback stage. At the beginning, there is much gas flowing from
F to W, and the gaps between the gas fluxes of W–F and the
others are noticeable. Then, as the reservoir pressure decreases,
shale gas is produced through desorption from the matrix, and the
production peak is overlapping that of f–F at the late flowback
time.

5.2 Sensitivity Analysis
To investigate
the impacts of natural fracture closure coefficient (df), natural fracture density (nf), hydraulic fracture length (lF), hydraulic
fracture conductivity (Fc), and Langmuir’s
pressure (pL) on fracturing fluid flowback,
we simulated five groups of cases for sensitivity analysis. Only a
variable is changed in each group of simulation cases, with the remaining
identical to those in the base case. The comparisons among water production
rate, accumulated water recovery volume, gas production rate, and
accumulated gas production volume caused by various values of each
parameter are shown in Figures 4–13, and the simulation results are listed in Table 4.

The increase in hydraulic
fracture conductivity (Fc) shows a monotonically
increasing trend in water production
rate and accumulated water recovery volume but a monotonically decreasing
trend in gas production rate and accumulated gas production volume,
as shown in Figures 4 and 5. These changing trends can also be
observed in the sensitivity simulation cases of hydraulic fracture
length (lF), but much less significant,
as shown in Figures 6 and 7.

On the other hand, the rise
in natural fracture closure coefficient
(df) from 0 to 0.12 MPa–1 shows opposite trends, with all the simulation results suffering
losses, as shown in Figures 8 and 9. However, there are growths
in both the two rates and two accumulated production volumes when
increasing the natural fracture density (nf), as shown in Figures 10 and 11.

It is worth mentioning
that the increase of Langmuir’s pressure
(pL) from 4.5 to 10 MPa51,67 causes extraordinary minor inclines in both the rates and accumulated
production volumes for gas and water, but the curves almost coincide
with each other in a relatively short simulation time period because
of these week disparities, as shown in Figures 12 and 13. Because
of the incline of Langmuir’s pressure (pL), there is more shale gas produced through desorption, increasing
the energy in shale formation. Therefore, the extra positive force
contributes to the growths of both the water production rate and accumulated
water recovery volume. The accumulated water recovery volume increases
by 0.0356%, and the accumulated gas production volume rises by 0.1542%
when running the sensitivity simulation case of pL = 10 MPa. The gaps are estimated to enlarge and be more
noticeable in a much longer duration.

The results indicate that
the hydraulic fracture conductivity (Fc) increasing from 2 to 3 D·cm causes positive
effect on the loaded water recovery, but it remarkably decreases the
gas production. The increase from 320 to 400 of hydraulic fracture
length (lF) leads to a rise in water flowback
recovery but a slight drop in gas production. The decline of closure
coefficient in induced natural fractures (df) from 0.12 to 0 contributes to the significant rises in both water
flowback recovery and gas production. An impractical increase by 1.8%
of loaded water recovery can be calculated in the case with df = 0, that is, without accounting for the natural
fracture closure. With the natural fracture density (nf) decreasing from 25 to 1, both the water flowback recovery
and the gas production suffer losses. The increase of Langmuir’s
pressure (pL) from 4.5 to 10 MPa causes
extraordinary minor inclines in both water load recovery and gas production.

6 Field Application
In this section, the numerical
simulator based on HMC model43 is applied
for analyzing the flowback water
data from two actual shale gas wells in the Longmaxi Formation, Southern
Sichuan Basin, China. The HMC model43 can
simulate the complex fracture network, natural fracture dilation,
and chemical potential equilibrium, which have not been coupled in
previous flowback models. The flowback data analysis and history matching
using the HMC model can provide extra information, such as the induced
fracture density, which is useful for fracture characterization and
post-stimulation evaluation in shale gas reservoirs.

Basic reservoir
and fluid properties of the two shale gas wells
(well WY and YY) are given in Table 5 according to the field geological report; gas−water
relative permeability and capillary pressure curves of shale matrix
are set based on field core tests, while those of induced natural
fractures are set according to the reference paper.66

According to the well completion reports,
the lateral length of
well WY is 1500 m and a 20-stage, 4-cluster per stage hydraulic fracturing
treatment was conducted. With a designed half-length of 180 m, the
fractures are created evenly in all individual stages. The drainage
area controlled by well WY is 1500 m × 800 m × 30 m (length
× width × thickness), while well YY is completed with a
20-stage hydraulic fracturing treatment along the 1500 m horizontal
wellbore, with five transverse fractures created evenly perpendicular
to the horizontal wellbore in each fracture stage. The thickness,
length, and width of the drainage area for well YY are 42, 1500, and
800 m, respectively.

We input the certain parameters of each
well into the simulator,
that is, the basic reservoir, fluid, and fracture properties in Table 5 and the information
for the two wells, adjusted the unknown parameters when conducting
history matching, that is, effective hydraulic fracture half-length,
effective hydraulic fracture conductivity, and density of induced
natural fractures, and ran the simulation for the two wells, respectively,
until both the curve of water/gas rate versus flowback time and the
curve of cumulative water/gas production volume versus time generated
by the numerical model match well with the authentic curves of water/gas
rate versus flowback time and cumulative water/gas production volume
versus time from the field data. The bottom-hole flowing pressures
of well WY and well YY, shown in Figures 14 and 15, were estimated
from surface casing pressure measurements and are set as the input
for simulation. The good matching of water and gas transients (Figures 16 and 17) and cumulative water/gas production volume (Figures 18 and 19) provides two groups of fracture network parameter
combination, that is, the effective hydraulic fracture half-length
of 160 m, the effective hydraulic fracture conductivity of 1 D·cm,
and the density of induced natural fractures of 7 m–2 for well WY, while the effective hydraulic fracture half-length
of 180 m, the effective hydraulic fracture conductivity of 1.4 D·cm,
and the density of induced natural fractures of 11 m–2 for well YY.

There is a 61 day recording history for well WY.
The first month
is the flowback period for well WY because water predominates in the
produced fluid, while the gas rates are extraordinarily low. On the
contrary, in the second half of the recording history for well WY,
gas started to breakthrough in the flowing system, showing a straightly
upward trend in the first 2 days and then declining to a relatively
stable level, at 1.4 × 106 m3/d. Finally,
there are some fluctuations in water and gas rates because of the
changing trends in bottom-hole flowing pressure. The daily gas production
rate is estimated to maintain at around 1.4 × 106 m3/d in the future, and the cumulative gas production volume
will also rise considerably, while the water recovery volume is going
to reach a plateau. According to the summary of hydraulic fracturing
treatment, 39.8% of loaded water is recovered, indicating that most
of the fracturing fluid was trapped in the induced natural fractures
and then flowed back to the surface when opening the well, while a
small fraction of water imbibed into the shale matrix because of the
long-term contact with the induced natural fracture face, to displace
shale gas in the matrix.

On the other hand, Figure 17 shows a 26-day of water and
gas production history for well
YY. Water is the dominant flowing fluid before the 13th day, when
there was a dramatic increase in the gas rate. During the latter 13
days, despite some fluctuation, water rate shows a downward trend,
while gas shows an upward trend. According to the summary of hydraulic
fracturing treatment, the ratio of loaded water recovered volume is
14.1%. Although the loaded water will continue to flow back at approximately
100 m3/d, the gas rate is predicted to increase continuously
and be much higher than 1.5 × 105 m3/d
in the future because the recovered fracture network parameter combination
is credible and considerable coupling the upward trend in the curve
of gas rate versus time.

It is interesting to note that the
histories of both the two wells
experienced three flowing periods, that is, water-dominant period,
gas breaking through and water production period, and gas-dominant
period.

7 Conclusions
In this paper, numerical
investigation of fracturing fluid flowback
in a hydraulically fractured shale gas well is conducted using the
proposed model. Field data matching of flowback water transients from
the Longmaxi Formation, Southern Sichuan Basin, China, is investigated
for fracture characterization. Our main conclusions are given below.(1) During
the 5-day flowback period,
water flowed into the shale matrix from induced natural fractures,
and there is no flowback water from the matrix because of the strong
capillarity and chemical osmosis. Main hydraulic fractures contribute
to 45% of recovered fracturing fluid, while induced natural fractures
account for 55% of total.

(2) The five dominating phenomena, that
is, natural fracture closure coefficient, natural fracture density,
hydraulic fracture length, hydraulic fracture conductivity, and Langmuir’s
pressure, show various influences on water load recovery and gas production
volume. The hydraulic fracture conductivity predominates in water
recovery and gas produced, followed by the natural fracture density.
The influences of the hydraulic fracture length and the natural fracture
closure are relatively weak, while Langmuir’s pressure shows
the minimum effect.

(3) Flowback data can provide quantitative
information for fracture characterization. With the proposed flowback
model, the matching of simulated water and gas transients with the
field collection gives a group of fracture parameter combination,
that is, the effective hydraulic fracture half-length, the effective
hydraulic fracture conductivity, and the density of induced natural
fractures.
