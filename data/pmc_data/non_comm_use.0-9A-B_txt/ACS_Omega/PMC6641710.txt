Electrically
conductive metal–organic coordination polymers
(CPs) are promising candidates for a variety of technological applications.
However, poor energetic and spatial overlap between the sp-electrons of organic ligands and the d-electrons
of metal ion often blocks an effective charge transport (mobility)
across CPs. Herein, we present a bimetallic design principle for enhancing
carrier mobility in CPs. Bimetallic CPs of Fe(III) and Cr(III) ions
coordinated to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) ligand (Fe–BTC–Cr)
exhibited remarkably high carrier mobility at the matching mole ratio
(1:1) with enhancement factors of 102 and 104 in comparison to those of monometallic parents, Fe–BTC and
Cr–BTC, respectively. The observation was substantiated by
lowering of the band gap between the valence band and the conduction
band upon the formation of a hybrid p–n-type structure in the bimetallic CPs. The direct current
conductivity values of the CPs measured by four-probe technique were
in good agreement with the alternating current conductivity values
obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Our flexible
approach of picking and choosing the appropriate combination of metal
ions from the periodic table is expected to generate various CPs with
desirable semiconducting properties.

1 Introduction
Exploring
new materials with desired functionalities are demanding in the dominance
of Si-based
materials upon inception in the semiconductor industry.1 Various inorganic-based semiconductors have been
investigated and found
to possess good electrical properties, but also accompanying brittleness.
On the other hand, organic-based semiconductors are chemically customizable
and mechanically flexible, but they suffer from poor electrical performances
and thermal management.2 Very recently,
organic–inorganic hybrids such as metal–organic coordination
polymers (CPs) have come up to challenge these conventional materials
by revealing a high degree of mutability3,4 and thus appealing
for electronic device applications with controllable electrical conductivity.5 For example, tunable electrical conductivity
in the thin-film devices of CPs was achieved by infiltration with
specific guest molecules such as tetracyanoquinodimethane and ferrocene.6−9 An insulator CP was transformed into a semiconductor composite material
upon incorporation of the chains of conducting polymer and such a
strategy could provide platforms for various CP-based functional nanomaterials.10,11 Furthermore, a million-fold conductivity enhancement was observed
on altering the metal ion from Mn(II) to Fe(II) in the CPs family
MOF-74.12 Replacement of Mn(II) with Fe(II)
yielded isostructural CP with a much better electrical conductivity
owing to (−Fe–S)∞ chains and loosely
bound β-spin electron in Fe(II).

Regardless of the electrical
conductivity modulation or enhancement,
much attention is sacrificed over carrier mobility and density values,
also detailed discussions over the important semiconducting parameters
were scarcely unveiled in the view of a simple equation: σ =
ηeμ (where σ is the conductivity,
η is the carrier density, and μ is
the carrier mobility).13 Stimulated from
the recent progress and visualizing the tuning of electrical conductivity
in CPs via incorporating two metal ions rather than one metal ion,
we thought to explore the emerging concept of “bimetallic”
CPs, specifically in regard to the tailoring of electronic states14−18 (Figure 1b). Instead
of a single metal ion (monometallic, Figure 1a), we have synthesized bimetallic CPs by
employing Fe(III) and Cr(III) ions in stoichiometric ratios with organic
ligand 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC). Surprisingly, the bimetallic
analogues (Fe–BTC–Cr) displayed remarkably higher electrical
conductivity and carrier mobility values compared with monometallic
parents (Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC). The Hall effect measurements
show the electronic properties of semiconductor materials so as to
deepen our understanding of the design principles of electrically
conductive CPs, thus extending their promise in the field of electronics.

and (b) bimetallic (Fe–BTC–Cr) CPs. Purple box represents
BTC ligand and orange and sky spheres represent iron and chromium
metal ions, respectively.

2 Results and Discussion
Fe–BTC and
Cr–BTC gels were prepared upon minor modifications
of the reported methods, and CPs in the form of xerogels were isolated
by drying the respective gels under vacuum at room temperature.19 To synthesize the different stoichiometric ratios
of bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr gel, we mixed 1:1, 1:2, and
2:1 Fe(III)/Cr(III) nitrate salts together with BTC in ethanol solvent.
The colors of all of gels/xerogels were found to be distinctively
different (Figure 2a–c): Fe–BTC (orange); Cr–BTC (dark green);
and Fe–BTC–Cr (red wine). The different colors of CPs
could originate from the characteristic ligand-to-metal charge transfer.
In the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, the C=O stretching
vibration of BTC at ∼1730 cm–1 was shifted
to ∼1630 cm–1 in all of the CPs, thereby
suggesting a successful coordination of the BTC ligand with Fe(III)
and Cr(III) ions.16,19 In case of the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr,
the stretching vibrations as ∼470 and ∼525 cm–1 were characteristic of Fe–O and Cr–O bonds, respectively
(Figure S1).

electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showing the crystalline nature
of the bimetallic CP.

Morphological features of CPs were investigated by FESEM.
Micrometer-sized
irregular yet crystalline blocks were observed for Fe–BTC,
whereas Cr–BTC revealed globular/fibrous patterns (Figure 2a,b). Interestingly,
the FESEM images of the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr system
showed regular cuboids and closely
resembled the morphology of the Fe–BTC system (Figure 2c). Because the ionic radii
of Fe(III) and Cr(III) are almost identical20 (∼60 and ∼62 pm, respectively), apparently Cr(III)
ions did not hamper the homogeneous gelation process in the mixed
phase with Fe(III) ions, namely, the formation of the Fe–BTC–Cr
cuboids like Fe–BTC.

A TEM image supported the FESEM
studies, and the layered structure
of the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr system could be clearly
visualized (Figures 2d and S2). Also, the SAED pattern indicated
the presence of a high degree of crystallinity in the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system (Figure 2d,
inset). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the Fe–BTC,
Cr–BTC, and Fe–BTC–Cr systems corroborated the
FESEM/TEM observations; specifically, the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system adopted the structure of the monometallic Fe–BTC system,
that is, close resemblance to the previously reported single-crystal
structure, though impurity phases are inherent in polycrystalline
materials like metal–organic xerogels explored here (Figure S3).21

To check the modulation of porosity in bimetallic CPs, if there
is any, in comparison to monometallic parents, we recorded the N2 gas adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K for the
Fe–BTC, Cr–BTC, and Fe–BTC–Cr (1:1) systems
(Figure 3). The isotherms
are typical of type I adsorption, specifically adsorbing higher amount
of N2 gas, as higher partial pressure and the sharp uptake
of N2 near about 1 bar pressure could be due to the pore
condensation effect.22,23 Interestingly, the uptake of
N2 gas in the Fe–BTC–Cr system was significantly
higher than that of the Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC systems, which
could possibly be due to “heterogeneity” factor.16 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area of Fe–BTC–Cr was found to be ∼338
m2 g–1. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic
(EDXS) analysis of bimetallic CPs was carried out to scrutinize the
relative ratio of metal ions as well as their distribution across
crystallites. The bimetallic CPs were prepared in different elemental
ratios of Fe and Cr; therefore, we had to closely look into the elemental
ratio across the Fe–BTC–Cr cuboids. Interestingly, at
each point, the percentage of atomic composition was close to the
initial feed. Also, the elemental mapping of bimetallic CPs showed
a homogeneous distribution of Fe and Cr across the material for 1:1,
2:1, and 1:2 ratios (Figures 4a and S4).24 Thus, our simple experimental methodology of metal–organic
gelation allowed the formation of the so-called truly/homogeneously
bimetallic CPs.

system by EDXS. (b) Fe 2p and Cr 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra recorded on 1:1 Fe–BTC–Cr
sample at room temperature.

To check the charge-transfer reaction involving Fe(III) and
Cr(III)
ions in the bimetallic system, we employed the XPS (Figure 4b). The appearance of Fe 2p3/2 and Cr 2p3/2 peaks at the binding energy values of 711.3 eV (with multiplet feature)
and 577.4 eV, respectively, suggests the predominant presence of Fe(III)
and Cr(III) ions in the 1:1 bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr system;25 from the relative intensities of Fe 2p and Cr 2p, the elemental composition
of Fe/Cr was estimated to be ∼1:1. Note that 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 doublet
spectral lines are due to the spin–orbit coupling and intrinsic
atomic property.

The direct current (dc) electrical conductivity
(σ) was recorded
at the room temperature by a conventional four-probe method using
the pressed pellets of various CPs. The conductivity values of the
Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC systems were found to be in the range
of ∼10–5–10–7 S
cm–1, respectively (Figure 5a). Note that the four-probe method is recommended
for CPs with resistivity exceeding 1 kΩ.26 Our recorded values on the Fe and Cr systems exactly refresh
the pioneering work of Dincă and co-workers in which the role
of metal ion (Fe and Mn) in influencing the electrical conductivity
value was well demonstrated.12 Such an
important effect could rather provide us a rational approach for tuning
the electrical conductivity over a wide range (∼10–5–10–7 S cm–1 in the present
study) by incorporating two different metal ions in the same CP. Indeed,
the conductivity of a mechanical mixture (1:1) of Fe–BTC and
Cr–BTC was noted to be ∼10–6 S cm–1 (Figure S5)—clearly
an intermediate of the values of the two. Surprisingly, the electrical
conductivity values of the self-assembled bimetallic CPs—both
2:1 (Fe/Cr) and 1:2 (Fe/Cr)—were estimated to be in the range
of ∼10–4 S cm–1. Also,
for the 1:1 (Fe/Cr) bimetallic system, we observed an electrical conductivity
value in the range of ∼10–3 S cm–1—102-fold higher than that of Fe–BTC and
104-fold higher than that of Cr–BTC (Figure 5a). Now, the question is—why?

Figure 5 (a) Room
temperature electrical conductivity values of Fe–BTC
(red), 2:1 Fe/Cr (violet), 1:1 Fe/Cr (green), 1:2 Fe/Cr (pink), and
Cr–BTC (blue). Inset: schematic of proposed band diagram causing
lowering of the band gap in the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system. (b) Tauc plots of Fe–BTC (red), Cr–BTC (blue),
1:1 Fe–BTC–Cr (green), and mechanical mixture (Fe–BTC
+ Cr–BTC) (black) recorded at room temperature. Inset: new
band at ∼1.75 eV for the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system.

Usually, significant lowering
of the band gap between the valence
band (VB) and conduction band (CB) in the hybrid materials is found
to be the primary cause of such an enhancement in the electrical conductivity
with respect to the parent compounds. Typical examples include organic-based
donor–acceptor complexes27,28 and/or inorganic-based
hybrid p–n semiconductors,29 which
could be applicable to our bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr system
(Figure 5a; inset).
We recorded the Tauc plots, namely, solid-state UV–vis absorption
spectra,30 to estimate the band gap values
of the Fe–BTC, Cr–BTC, and Fe–BTC–Cr systems
(Figure 5b). In fact,
a lowering of the band gap (∼2.4 eV) in the case of Fe–BTC–Cr
was observed compared with that of both Fe–BTC (∼2.8
eV) and Cr–BTC (∼3.8 eV). Furthermore, appearance of
a new band at ∼1.75 eV for the 1:1 Fe–BTC–Cr
system (absent in Fe–BTC, Cr–BTC, and 1:1 mechanical
mixture Fe–BTC + Cr–BTC) served as a clear signature
of the hybrid charge transfer state (weak) in the bimetallic CP. Notably,
a recent report provided theoretical insights into the significant
modulation of electronic band structures (electrical conductivity)
in bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) in comparison
with that in monometallic parents.18

Another possibility for such an enhancement in the electrical conductivity
of bimetallic CPs could be the formation of a “coordination
track” in the material generating a low-dimensional charge
transport pathway.12,13 For example, Dincǎ and
co-workers have nicely shown that the introduction of S/O substitution
in the ligand in a Mn2+-based CP formed a one-dimensional
chain (−Mn–O/S−)∞, which increased
the carrier mobility significantly vis-à-vis enhancement in
the electrical conductivity up to a million-fold. Motivated by the
example, we wanted to check the influence of light on the electrical
conductivity values of our bimetallic CPs. However, our preliminary
studies showed that upon irradiation with 1 sun intensity light, no
appreciable change in the conductivity value was observed and thus
photocurrent transients would be more desirable to conclude on coordination
track.13

The semiconducting characteristics
of Fe–BTC, Cr–BTC,
and Fe–BTC–Cr were evaluated by the Hall effect measurements
(Figure 6), and the
important extracted parameters are summarized in Table 1. Typically, the Hall coefficient
(RH) values of nonmagnetic semiconductors
are independent of the magnetic field. Because our monometallic and
bimetallic CPs were both paramagnetic in nature (Figure S6), the Hall resistivity includes an additional contribution
and depends on the magnetization of the samples—commonly referred
as anomalous Hall effect.31 We observed
a strong dependency of RH values of Fe–BTC,
Cr–BTC, and Fe–BTC–Cr on the applied magnetic
field (B). The data points in the plots of RH versus B could be best fitted
with the equation: RH = RH0 + (C/B), where C is a constant and RH0 is the field-independent Hall coefficient (so-called
ordinary Hall coefficient)—likewise modified Curie–Weiss
equation for metal–organic paramagnets with the inclusion of
a temperature-independent magnetization term (χ0)
(Figure S7).32 Overall, it is not only the electrical conductivity values that
are different for Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC but also the CPs
are inherently different—the former is a p-type semiconductor, whereas the later one is an n-type semiconductor. Thus, naturally, a p–n hybrid structure in the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system is expected to take place, therefore lowering of the gap between
VB and CB was observed. Remarkably, the carrier mobility value (μ)
of Fe–BTC–Cr was almost 3 orders of magnitude higher
than that of Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC, also the μ value
of our 1:1 bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr system is perhaps the
best among the reported values of various CPs13,33−36 and relevant organic-based hybrid materials (Table S1). This tremendous increase in the mobility of bimetallic
analogues is attributed to the reduction in the energy barrier for
hopping of “Coulomb holes” by “Coulomb attraction”
and/or formation of “two-dimensional electron gas”.37,38 Also, the presence of Fe could uniquely promote the electrical conductivity
in the bimetallic CPs.39 Electrical conductivity
of Fe–BTC–Cr system could be further improved by engineering
the ligand containing the O/S atoms.12

Finally, measuring
and reporting the values of electrical conductivity
of CPs is an important issue, as elegantly discussed by Dincǎ
and co-workers in a case of Cd-based CP. Depending on the technique
and external factors, the conducting value of the same CP sample can
vary by more than one order of magnitude.26 Usually, four-probe method is used for low-resistance materials
to remove the effect of the contact resistance. If the method is applied
to high-resistance materials like most of the CPs, the conductivities
calculated by the voltage difference could be overestimated.40 Therefore, apart from the four-probe method,
we also explored the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
to estimate the electrical conductivity values of the Fe–BTC,
Cr–BTC, and Fe–BTC–Cr (1:1) samples. Measured
data points in the Nyquist plots were fitted with a modified Randle
circuit (Figure 7a–d).40,41 The electrical conductivity values of Fe–BTC, Cr–BTC,
and Fe–BTC–Cr (1:1) measured by EIS were found to be
∼3.0 × 10–6, ∼5.0 × 10–8, and ∼1.5 × 10–4 S
cm–1, respectively. Indeed, the overall trend in
the electrical conductivity reflected by the EIS technique was very
similar to that observed with the four-probe technique; specifically,
bimetallic CPs consistently exhibited much higher electrical conductance
than monometallic parent CPs. To show case our results on bimetallic
CPs in the domain of electrically conductive and porous CPs, a collation
of the electrical conductivity values and the BET surface area of
various systems is presented in Table S2.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the strategy of elapsing
from monometallic to bimetallic
porous CPs to enhance electrical conductivity and carrier mobility
is established. At matching mole ratio, the bimetallic Fe–BTC–Cr
system exhibited a significantly higher porosity as well as career
mobility in comparison with the monometallic Fe–BTC and Cr–BTC
systems. The elevated value of mobility has been assigned to the hybrid
donor–acceptor/p–n assembly. Our strategy of picking and choosing the appropriate combination
of metal ions can be applied to generate a variety of electrically
conducting CPs for electronic and electrochemical applications.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Synthesis
BTC, ferric
nitrate (Fe), chromium nitrate
(Cr),
and ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (India). A 0.6 mmol
(242.4 mg) of ferric nitrate and 0.6 mmol (126.0 mg) BTC each were
dissolved in 4 mL ethanol and subsequently mixed together with sonication
to form the Fe–BTC gel.19 Similarly,
the Cr–BTC gel was prepared by dissolving BTC (42.4 mg, 0.2
mmol) and chromium nitrate (80.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) in ethanol (0.5 mL
each). Both the solutions were mixed together with sonication and
kept at 80 °C for 4 h. The Fe–BTC–Cr gel was prepared
in a similar procedure in which 0.6 mmol of mixed metal (ferric nitrate/chromium
nitrate = 1:1) and 0.6 mmol of BTC were dissolve in 4 mL ethanol solvent
and both solution were rapidly mixed together and kept at room temperature.

4.2 Characterization
FTIR spectra were
recorded in a Nicolet 6700 spectrophotometer using KBr pellet. Solid-state
UV–vis spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 900
spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere in the 250–800
nm range. The Kubelka–Munk function was used to convert the
reflectance spectra into the equivalent absorption spectra using the
reflectance of BaSO4 as reference. FESEM imaging and EDXS
analysis were performed in a Carl-Zeiss Ultra microscope. The TEM
images were recorded in Philips CM200 instrument. The XPS spectra
of powder samples were obtained
in Phi 5000 VersaProbe-II instrument equipped with a monochromatic
Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source and a hemispherical electron
analyzer. The dc conductivity values were measured by the four-probe
technique using Keithley 6221 alternating current and dc current sourcemeter
and 2182A Nanovoltmeter. The PXRD patterns of all xerogels were recorded
from 2θ = 5 to 40° at room temperature in Bruker D8 advanced
diffractometer. The magnetic measurements of powder samples were performed
in MPMS XL SQUID instrument from Quantum Design. The Hall effect measurements
were performed using the five-probe method in Quantum Design-PPMS-Evercool
II instrument at room temperature. All of the xerogel materials were
pressed into bar-shaped pellets. All of the contacts between the probe
and pellet were made by the connecting gold wires. EIS measurements
have been recorded in PARSTAT MC Potentiostat, PMC-2000 with a two-electrode
setup. Furthermore, the pressed pellets were clipped between copper
disks assembly, and the impedance measurements were performed in 1–100
MHz frequency range.
