Photoinduced antibacterial
gold nanoparticles were developed as
an alternative for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Thanks to the amoxicillin coating, they possess high in vivo stability,
selectivity for the bacteria wall, a good renal clearance, and are
completely nontoxic for eukaryotic cells at the bactericidal concentrations.
A simple one-step synthesis of amoxi@AuNP is described at mild temperatures
using the antibiotic as both reducing and stabilizing agent. Time-resolved
fluorescence microscopy proved these novel nano-photosensitizers,
with improved selectivity, are bactericidal but showing excellent
biocompatibility toward eukaryotic cells at the same dose (1.5 μg/mL)
when co-cultures are analyzed. Their stability in biological media,
hemocompatibility, and photo-antibacterial effect against sensitive
and antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated in vitro, whereas toxicity, renal clearance, and
biodistribution were studied in vivo in male Wistar rats. The use
of these nanoparticles to treat antibiotic-resistant infections is
promising given their high stability and cytocompatibility.

Introduction
Antibiotic-resistant
(AR) bacteria and the lethal infections they
can cause are a subject of public concern.1,2 Indeed,
the World Health Organization has described antibiotic resistance
as “a problem so serious that it threatens the achievements
of modern medicine”.3 Thus, there
is an urgent need for the development of novel strategies and drugs.
In recent years, nanoparticles have been tested as potential antibacterial
agents; particularly, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were chosen to act
as photosensitizers because of their inert nature and effectiveness
in spite of their polymorphism and polydispersity.4 Further, AuNP plasmons can absorb visible light,5 thus avoiding the use of highly energetic wavelengths
that cause cell photodamage, proving useful for cancer treatment.6 Additionally, we have shown the photoinduced
bactericidal properties of AuNPs utilizing green light, even on AR
clinical strains.7−10 Thus, plasmon excitation of the AuNPs can produce highly reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels causing oxidative stress after 4 h of
photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT), leading to bacterial
death. Furthermore, in vitro studies suggest that these AuNPs are
nontoxic for eukaryotic cells. These results stimulated the present
work to explore the selectivity toward prokaryotic cells in cell co-cultures
and the biocompatibility and distribution of the particles in vivo.

Many in vivo studies on the biodistribution and toxic effects of
AuNPs show that they are controlled by the nanomaterial size, shape,
and coating.11−13 The limited pore size of the endothelial wall in
the tissue is the primary delivery barrier for nanoparticles, but
it also allows selective accumulation in certain tissues. When nanoparticles
are administered through intraperitoneal (IP) or intravenous injection,
a variety of serum proteins bind to their surface, which are recognized,
internalized, and carried to the liver or spleen.14 It is known that the majority of the AuNPs after IP injection
are distributed to the liver and spleen in 2–3 h15 and that AuNPs had a high blood-clearance rate
being mostly distributed in the liver, followed by the spleen and
lungs.16 No matter the pathway used, AuNPs
seemed to migrate into the circulatory system first and subsequently
distributed into tissues and organs, thus mainly distributed by passive
targeting.17

It has been demonstrated
that AuNPs can enhance their bactericidal
properties when combined with antibiotics, such as vancomycin, aminoglycoside,
and amoxicillin, among others.18−23 Amoxicillin is a β-lactam antibiotic24 and, like other penicillins, binds to and inhibits the carboxypeptidase
and transpeptidase enzymes that are required for peptidoglycan biosynthesis
(Figure S1).25 The nitrogen-containing β-lactam ring is designed to target
the penicillin-binding membrane proteins, which are involved in the
cross-linking of the bacterial cell wall. Interestingly, amoxicillin
is capable of reducing26 Au(III) to Au(0)
and stabilizing the resulting AuNPs due to high affinity of the amino
groups to the gold surface.

Here, we present the one-pot synthesis
of amoxicillin-coated AuNPs
(amoxi@AuNPs) that combined to show enhanced photo-antimicrobial effect,
i.e., highly reduced amount of antibiotic (typically 500 mg per dose
are used), short irradiation time (∼30 min), and high selectivity
toward prokaryotic cells. Facile-to-prepare amoxicillin-coated AuNPs
were stable inside the bloodstream and tissue distribution, showing
rapid clearance from the organism at the same time. In this sense,
they are a better option for clinical use in comparison to other stabilizing
agents, such as glutathione.27 Furthermore,
we introduce a novel method to check the selectivity of the toxicity
in a co-culture of bacteria and blood cells through time-resolved
fluorescence microscopy.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of Amoxi@AuNPs
AuNPs
were synthesized by thermal reduction utilizing amoxicillin as both
reducing and stabilizing agent. The absorption spectrum (Figure 1) of the amoxi@AuNPs
shows the characteristic plasmon band of small spherical nanoparticles
centered around 540 nm, whereas the presence of a second absorption
band around 950 nm can account for the plasmon absorption bands of
more complex nanostructures, namely, triangular, hexagonal, and irregular
polygonal plates, including nanorods (see Figures S2–S4).28

Figure 1 Normalized absorption
spectra of unprotected AuNP (black) and of
amoxi@AuNPs (red). The absorption wavelength at around 950 nm accounts
for the presence of nonspherical nanostructures.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements determined a
hydrodynamic
radius for the amoxi@AuNPs of 79 ± 43 nm. The broad distribution
of particle sizes found by this technique is in agreement with the
presence of larger nonspherical nanostructures, in contrast to the
AuNPs synthesized with NaBH4 (“unprotected”
AuNPs) that show a more monodisperse size distribution: 8 ± 2
nm. The positive ζ (Zeta) potential value found for amoxi@AuNPs
(+30 ± 7 mV) confirms the effectiveness of the amoxicillin as
colloidal stabilizer.

The conjugation of the stabilizer agent
to the nanoparticle was
confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (see Figure S5). AuNPs showed ∼11% amoxicillin
loading, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This amount
is enough to stabilize the particle, but it is very low compared to
the daily dose administered to a patient (1–2 g), which could
minimize all of the amoxicillin side effects.29,30

These new amoxi@AuNP composites showed great stability in different media, such as phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) 37.5, 25, 12.5, and 7.5% for 72 h; ceramide monohexoside
(CMH) 25% for 48 h; CMH 12.5 and 7.5%; CTS 25, 12.5, and 7.5% for
168 h; and Milli-Q water for 96 h. (Figure S6). Nevertheless, they crashed immediately in all concentrated biological
media and PBS (100 and 50%). On the basis of these findings, microbiological
assays were carried out in 37.5% PBS, which allows the bacteria to
be metabolically active and does not interfere with the monitoring
of the plasmon absorption.

In Vitro Studies
Antibacterial Activity
Staphylococcus
aureus ATCC 29213 (MSSA) and a methicillin-resistant
clinical isolate of S. aureus (MRSA)
were killed by 1.5 μg/mL amoxi@AuNPs after only 30 min of irradiation
(Figure 2) with white
light using an light-emitting diode (LED) expo-panel (Figure S7). This is considerably faster than
other nano-photosensitizers we have previously tested under similar
exposure conditions.7,10 It is worth noting that light
itself does not produce any damage or change of the bacterial normal
growth. The selection of white light irradiation was based on the
broad absorption spectrum shown by the amoxi@AuNPs composites (Figure 1), ensuring the excitation
of most of the nanostructures present in the solution. Interestingly,
excitation using only green light (525 nm) did not produce antibacterial
effect; thus, the bactericidal effect requires the excitation of more
complex nanostructures using the full visible spectrum. Additionally,
amoxi@AuNPs were able to kill all of the MSAA after 90 min in the
dark but not the MRSA. This could be a consequence of the synergistic
effect18,31 between the antibiotic and the nanoparticle,
as amoxicillin alone was not bactericidal at this low dose. It is
important to highlight that the system temperature was kept at 37–38
°C during all of the experimental procedures. Despite the constant
bulk temperature, it is well known that the excitation of the surface
plasmon of AuNPs can induce a localized heat on the particle surface.
Thus, the high local temperature experienced by the bacteria in close
proximity to the surface of the particle could trigger their death.32 In fact, gold nanoparticles are able to convert
the absorbed light into heat very efficiently. These results in a
hot lattice and the temperature could increase up to tens of degrees,
enough to denaturalize biomolecules.33−35

time of MSSA (A, B) and MRSA (C, D) samples
treated under dark conditions (A–C) and under LED illumination
(B–D) in the presence of 1.5 μg/mL of amoxi@AuNPs (red),
0.15 μg/mL amoxi@AuNPs (blue), and as control samples in the
presence of amoxicillin at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC,
green) or PBS (black). Note that unprotected AuNP at 10× concentration
causes damage to the bacteria after 9–12 h of exposure to light
(not shown).10

ROS Quantification in Bacterial Culture
The generation
of ROS was determined for samples of MRSA phototreated with amoxi@AuNP
(at bactericidal concentrations). Figure 3 shows the maximum ROS production (almost
25 times basal level) quantified after just 10 min of irradiation.
This level of ROS generation is even higher than the one observed
for S. aureus treated with AuNP and
light.10 A significant amount of ROS formation
(almost 17 times basal level) can be formed after 30 min of irradiation,
although no bacterial growth was observed at that time. This could be due to the presence of some bacteria organelles and
structures, whose global integrity and functionality are too damaged
to keep bacteria alive. After 60 min, ROS production is negligible.
Dark levels are almost null (not shown). The temperature of all of
the samples (including the irradiated ones) was kept at 37 °C
during the whole experiment, avoiding the influence of macroscopic
thermal effect. This significant amount of ROS detected could indicate
that the bactericidal effect is in direct relation with the oxidative
stress generated in bacteria when amoxi@AuNP (attached to their wall)
are irradiated.

(at bactericidal concentrations).

Mammalian Cell Viability
The 3T3 cell line has become
the standard fibroblast cell line since Todaro and Green originally
obtained them from Swiss albino mouse embryo tissue in 1962.36,32 This line corresponds to immortalize cells; however, fibroblasts
are much more sensitive to external factors than HeLa cells, most
frequently used for in vitro experiments. For this reason, the activity
of its mitochondrial enzymes, as evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay, is an important parameter for the analysis of
the effects of new drugs on eukaryotic cells, as it is a reflection
of potential toxicity to mammals. Figure 4 shows the effect of free amoxicillin, unprotected
AuNPs, and amoxi@AuNPs on their antibacterial or photo-antibacterial
concentrations. Our results suggest that the cell viability of the
samples with antibiotic or nanoparticles is similar to control without
drug (37.5% PBS), and they all presented slightly less survival than
the control with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM). Free amoxicillin was found to be nontoxic to other mammal
cells in previous literature reports, whereas our own studies described
the biocompatibility of uncoated AuNPs.10,37

Figure 4 Cell survival

amoxi@AuNP, 2 μg/mL unprotected AuNP, 32 μg/mL amoxicillin,
37.5% PBS, and DMEM under 24 h visible light irradiation (red) and
under dark conditions (gray) for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity.

Figure 4 shows
that
amoxi@AuNPs were not cytotoxic even under the same irradiation conditions
used for the antimicrobial test. Similar results were found for gold
nanoparticles embedded in amphiphilic block copolymers.38 AuNPs are essentially harmless compared to other
antimicrobial nanoparticles, such as zinc nanoparticles, which have
a substantial toxic impact on human fibroblast after 24 h.39 This demonstrates that the proposed photosensitizer
is selectively toxic for bacteria and does not affect eukaryotic cells
to any significant extent, due to the absence of any penicillin-binding
protein 1A on the eukaryotic membrane.

Parenteral and intraperitoneal
injection of nanoparticles can produce
high local concentration and broad distribution in the circulating
blood, leading to the need for evaluation of their biological safety.
Ex vivo experiments on whole blood were conducted because erythrocytes
together with other blood cells and serum content reflect properly
the actual conditions in mammals.40 Experiments
were performed at t = 0, 2, 5, and 24 h in the dark
and under LED irradiation, with the bactericidal concentration of
amoxi@AuNP (1.5 μg/mL). Total hemolysis was established by adding
H2O to the red blood cell samples; n =
3; SD < 0.1 (see Figure S7 for illumination
details). The tested amoxi@AuNPs did not produce any alteration to
the red blood cells, as shown in Table 1. There was no hemolysis at all, even under irradiation
conditions. Thus, the amoxi@AuNPs are selectively toxic for bacteria
and do not affect erythrocytes. Under these illumination conditions,
the photothermal effect is then harmless for eukaryotic cells.

Table 1 Hemolysis Percentage (%) of Blood
Samples Treated with 1.5 μg/mL Amoxi@AuNP and with 0.9% NaCl
as Negative Control and H2O as Positive Control
To further prove that amoxi@AuNPs
are selectively toxic for bacteria,
co-cultures with blood cells were treated with the particles under
the same irradiation conditions. The fluorescence lifetime imaging
microscopy (FLIM) technique is extremely useful in bioimaging, where,
for instance, light scattering can interfere with steady-state fluorescence
imaging. The fluorescence lifetime can change depending on the fluorophore
environment and hence the same fluorophore can be tracked in different
locations utilizing the same emission wavelength. Here, we use this
technique together with a well-known DNA and RNA intercalator, acridine
orange (AO-see Figure S8).41 Concentrations of AO around 0.3 mg/mL (1 mM) or higher
lead to the formation of nonfluorescent dimers.42 However, AO can intercalate in nucleic acid helices as
the cationic monomer can presumably bind through electrostatic interaction
with negatively charged phosphate. This interaction recovers the AO
fluorescent properties and is the reason why AO is extensively used
as a biological stain in fluorescence microscopy. When bound to ssDNA,
AO shows a stable emission maximum at 630 nm upon excitation at around
458 nm. Interestingly, AO, when externally bound to disorganized or
broken genetic material, is energetically less stable and is also
very weakly emissive.43 Here, AO was found
to bind to the genetic material in both live bacteria and cells showing
emission around 630 nm upon excitation at 440 nm. When the cells are
subjected to damage, the genetic material of a dead cell is severely
disrupted if not completely disintegrated. As a consequence, the AO
most likely spreads into the solution as the nonfluorescent dimer
forms or remains externally bound to the remaining DNA/RNA bases,
producing a weak and short emission. Interestingly, the lifetime of
the emissive structures is different when the AO is attached to live
bacteria (ca. 3–7 ns), live white blood cells (ca. 7–14
ns), or bound externally to the disrupted genetic material of dying
cells (<3 ns) with a lifetime almost as short as free AO.44 Thus, using time-resolved fluorescence techniques,
we were able to differentiate live bacteria or eukaryotic cells from
dead ones.

According to the lifetime color scale at the bottom
of Figure 5, groups
of S. aureus appeared bright green
when alive (Figure 5A) and the few dead
coccus that are dead but were not completely broken by photothermal
effect of PACT appeared blue (Figure 5B), indicating a decrease in the AO emission lifetime.
Live erythrocytes (without nucleus or genetic material) were observed
as pale green rings (Figure 5C–E) and were not found after heating the control sample
(Figure 5F). The same
sample presented a 98% of hemolysis in parallel measurements. Regarding
eukaryotic cells with genetic material, lymphocytes, were observed
as bright yellow-orange spots when alive (Figure 5C–E) and pale green spots when dying
or damaged (Figure 5F). A larger white blood cell (eosinophil) was observed alive (Figure 5E). Its nucleus appeared
dull green because of the lax chromatin content; however, the AO presented
longer lifetimes, up to 14 ns in the cytoplasm, due its strong interaction
with eosinophilic granules, described by Ueki et al.45 and previously by Robbins et al.46 The aforementioned difference in the emission lifetime of AO was
developed as a practical and fast method to study the survival of
both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells together. It requires just one
fluorescent dye, one excitation laser, and one emission filter, in
contrast to other similar techniques that excite AO with different
lasers and need other fluorescent dyes as ethidium bromide or propidium
iodide as contrast agents.47,48

In Vivo Studies
The distribution
of the nanoparticles
in internal organs is crucial to determine their in vivo stability
and fate after the desired activity is completed. Following IP injection
(see Experimental Section), amoxi@AuNPs were
found using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure 6) inside the liver
(rows A and B), the kidney (rows C and D), and the spleen (rows E
and F). Importantly, they did not go through the brain–blood
barrier as amoxi@AuNPs were not found in brain tissue (data not shown).
In general, the nanoparticles were internalized in vesicles in Kupffer
cells in the liver just 2 h after IP injection. Usually, hepatobiliary
system represents the main route of excretion for particles that do
not undergo renal clearance.49 Nanoparticles
of diameter less than 100 nm, smaller than the pore size of liver
fenestrae, could have easily penetrated through the endothelial wall
too. At the same time, some amoxi@AuNPs were found in the spleen,
indicating that they had been carried there earlier by the phagocytic
cells. However, for these nanoparticles, our results indicate that
the largest NP amount was found in the kidneys (2 h post injection)
being internalized in vesicles after having gone through the microvilli.
Only a small fraction of the nanoparticles was found in the samples
taken 5 h after administration. This could be due to the elimination
in urine (vide infra) or as a result of normal process of vesicle
degradation because shrunken vesicles were observed (Figure 6IIIC,D). In kidneys and the
spleen, where a few nanoparticles were interacting with the dense
chromatin, around 5% of pyknotic nuclei were observed (n = 1008 cells), possibly as a consequence of the oxidative stress
generated by the nanomaterial.50 It is
noteworthy that after 24 h all three organs presented normal histopathology.
Their different composing cells (including hepatocytes, epithelial
and endothelial cells, podocytes, macrophages, and red and white blood
cells) looked unaltered and were of normal size and structure. The
AuNP without antibiotic stabilization were only found in small quantities
in the liver at 2 h, indicating their poor stability in biological
fluids after injection. According to our results, coating of AuNP
is necessary to improve their in vivo stability. To obtain a global
characterization, 2 grids were prepared for each organ (2 organs for
each condition) and over 300 TEM pictures were taken. The more representative
ones were selected to illustrate the path of the nanoparticles through
the tissues studied (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Representative TEM images of rat tissue samples showing the biodistribution
of amoxi@AuNPs in the liver (rows A and B), kidneys (rows C and D),
and spleen (rows E and F) after intraperitoneal injection. The scale
bar is the same (1 μm) for all images.

Additionally, particles larger than the effective pore size
in
normal intact endothelium (5 nm), such as those used here, experience
prolonged circulatory times due to slow transportation across the
endothelium; therefore, the study of their effect on blood cells is
quite relevant. Cell counting (Table 2) on samples of rats injected with nanoparticles (groups
I and II) was not different from the control animals (group III),
except for a slight increase in the number of neutrophils (10% over
top reference value, p < 0.05) in group II at
2 h. This is correlated with the observation of active phagocytic
cells in the liver, kidneys, and spleen at the same time. The elevation
in neutrophils may be due to the host response to the injection and
distribution of amoxi@AuNPs. Normal values were totally restored after
24 h as a sign of complete elimination of the nanoparticles from the
organism. According to microscope observation of smears, red blood
cells from group I to II kept their integrity, suggesting that they
were not stressed by the nanomaterial. This finding is in agreement
with the ex vivo hemolysis test results.

Finally, renal excretion is
the desirable pathway for AuNP removal
because it would keep the catabolism or breakdown to a minimum, avoiding
possible side effects.49 Renal clearance
as a fundamental part of drug elimination is determined by the molecular
chemical and physical properties, including size, surface charge,
and surface chemistry.51 Without such clearance
or their biodegradation into biologically benign components, the toxicity
potential increases. To address this concern, qualitative detection
of intact nanoparticles in urine was done by measuring their plasmon
absorption (Figure 7). Urine samples from group II showed an absorption peak (abs <
0.40) at 540 nm, consistent with spherical AuNP after 5 h of IP injection.
Apparently, other shapes and sizes would preferably be uptaken by
cells and degraded inside vesicles as shown in TEM pictures. It seems
that most of the nanomaterial is being eliminated between 2 and 5
h after injection because the plasmon peaks are not bigger in urine
samples collected 1 day after injection than in those collected 5
h after injection; in agreement with previous report.52 Both works suggest that the kidneys are the primary sites
for clearance of the smallest particles, followed by the hepatobiliary
system. No unprotected AuNPs were found in urine collected from group
I, supporting the hypothesis that uncoated AuNP are not being well
distributed/eliminated. In summary, amoxicillin
is beneficial not only for the stabilization of the nanoparticles
but also for their renal clearance.

Conclusions
The
combination of in vivo and in vitro studies presented here
showed that amoxi@AuNPs are suitable nanostructures for PACT applications.
amoxi@AuNPs can be easily synthesized in one pot utilizing amoxicillin
as both reducing and stabilizing agent. The particles are stable in
biological media and show photoinduced antibacterial activity (irradiation
time ∼30 min), even against AR strains. Importantly, amoxi@AuNPs
are very biocompatible with eukaryotic cells under PACT conditions.
The bacterial death is believed to occur upon localized surface plasmon
excitation of the AuNP. The antibiotic was used as a reducing agent
for the synthesis of AuNPs, and its presence confers the NP with the
selectivity toward the bacterial cell. This is a major advantage when
combating microorganism that produce lytic enzymes, developing antibiotic
resistance. Accordingly, the amoxi@AuNPs can act faster than silver
and zinc nanoparticles tested by other groups without plasmon excitation,53 showing their potential as antibacterial agents.

We have also demonstrated that FLIM can be very useful to determine
the cell selectivity and bactericidal activity in prokaryotic/eukaryotic
co-cultures by a rapid and simple analysis. This analysis only requires
one fluorescent dye, one excitation laser, and one emission filter,
in contrast to similar techniques that excite AO with different lasers
and need other fluorescent dyes as ethidium bromide or propidium iodide
as contrast agents.

Finally yet importantly, our results show
that the injected AuNPs
have a higher clearance rate than other similar nanomaterials54,55 and have not induced considerable cytotoxicity responses. As a result,
amoxi@AuNPs seem to have a low potential of accumulation in mammals.
These findings are remarkably useful for the potential development
of pharmaceutical formulations.

Experimental Section
Materials
Tetrachloroauric acid-99% (HAuCl4) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, and trihydrate amoxicillin was purchased from
Todo Droga (Argentina). Mueller Hinton broth (MHB), tryptic soy broth
(TSB), tryptic soy agar (TSA), brain heart infusion, Luria Bertani
broth, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from Britania
(Argentina).

Synthesis of Amoxi@AuNPs and AuNP
Antibiotic-coated
nanoparticles were prepared with amoxicillin in a one-step synthesis
using the antibiotic as both the reducing and stabilizer agent. This
bottom-up method is based on the reduction of the gold precursor (HAuCl4
100 μL, 10 mM) with amoxicillin trihydrate (900 μL, 0.1
mM) at 50 °C for 18 min. This corresponds to a 16 wt % of amoxicillin
with respect to the mass of Au. All solutions were freshly prepared
prior to the synthesis and left to stabilize at room temperature for
30 min before heating. Three cycles of Milli-Q water washing and centrifugation
were used to remove unbound amoxicillin molecules.

To obtain
500 mL of 0.2 mM unprotected AuNP, 1 mL of 0.1 M HAuCl4 aqueous solution was added to 500 mL of previously cooled Milli-Q
water (8 °C). Then, 10 mL of a NaBH4 (0.13 M) solution
was transferred dropwise to the flask.

Characterization of Amoxi@AuNP
The changes of the surface
plasmon resonance of the resuspended pellet and the absorption spectrum
of the amoxicillin molecules present in the supernatant were monitored
using a Cary 60 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The shape and size
of the synthesized AuNPa were measured by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM-Jeol 1200 EX II). Samples for TEM measurements were prepared
by placing a 4 μL drop of the amoxi@AuNP solution on carbon-coated
copper grids and left to dry completely at 37 °C in a drying
oven. At least 400 nanoparticles were analyzed statistically using
ImageJ software. On the same samples, ζ potential and dynamic
light scattering (DLS) were measured with a Malvern Zetasizer (model
Nano-S). The binding of amoxicillin to AuNP was analyzed by a Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer in transmission mode using
a Nicolet iN 10 spectrophotometer. Samples of amoxicillin trihydrate,
unprotected AuNP, and amoxi@AuNPs were freeze-dried and then measured
by FT-IR at low temperature.

The amount of amoxicillin was determined
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). For this, 4 mL of 1.5 μg/mL
of the amoxi@AuNPs were centrifuged down and pellets were combined
to be exhaustively dried in a desiccator for 48 h prior to TGA at
10 °C/min from 25 to 1000 °C under nitrogen atmosphere (flow
rate of 25 mL/min) with a TA-THA Q5000. The TGA curves were used to
determine the amoxicillin amount attached to AuNP by extrapolating
the weight loss values from the y-axis.

Colloidal Stability
Stability measurements of amoxi@AuNPs
(1.5 μg/mL) in different buffer solutions and growth media were
conducted on the basis of the change in plasmon absorbance maxima
at different time points, utilizing UV–vis spectrophotometry.
Stability was considered as the time it took for a 20% decrease in
plasmon absorption at the wavelength of the initial maximum absorbance.8 The stability measurements were carried out (using
a BioTek plate reader) for 7 days (time = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 18,
24, 48, 72, 120, 144, 168 h) in Milli-Q water, saline solution, PBS
(pH = 7), Mueller Hinton broth (MHB), and tryptic soy broth (TSB)
at different concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5%). To avoid contamination,
the stability measurement of nanoparticles dispersed in growth media
was conducted under sterile conditions.

Bacterial Strains and Growth
Conditions
The experiments
were performed using S. aureus ATCC
29213 (MSSA ATCC 29213) and a methicillin-resistant clinical isolate
of S. aureus (MRSA 9455). Clinical
isolate was supplied by the Bacteriology Service of Sanatorio Aconcagua,
Córdoba, Argentina. Stock cultures were maintained in TSB and
stored in a freezer in 10% glycerol.

Antibacterial Capacity
Antibacterial activity of novel amoxi@AuNPs against MSSA and MRSA was tested. Bacterial
suspensions of 106 colony-forming units per milliliter
(CFU/mL) in 37.5% PBS (pH = 7) from a single colony of each strain
were prepared. Using a 96-well plate, 100 μL of bacterial suspension
and 100 μL of the tested solutions (37.5% PBS, 0.15 μg/mL,
amoxi@AuNPs, 1.5 μg/mL amoxi@AuNPs, and amoxicillin at minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) per strain as control: 2 μg/mL
for MSSA and 32 μg/mL for MRSA) were mixed and irradiated for
a total of 90 min under white LED illumination at 37 °C. Control
experiments were run under the same conditions in the dark. All samples
were run in triplicate. Aliquots of each sample were diluted properly
and seeded in TSA plates. CFUs were counted from the agar after 24
h of incubation at 37 °C.

ROS Quantification in Bacterial
Culture
The prefluorescent
probe dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) was chosen for its high sensitivity
to quantify total ROS and reactive nitrogen species.56 This dye diffuses passively through most of cell membranes,
where DHR generates a fluorescent green signal at 536 nm when oxidized.
Radical indicators of oxidative stress were measured with DHR (1 μM)
in bacterial suspensions (109 CFU/mL) treated with a 1.5 μg/mL
of amoxi@AuNPs. The samples were irradiated for 10, 30, 60, and 90
min.

Cell Viability
The 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% calf
serum. Cells were grown until 85–95% confluence, then washed
with phosphate-buffer saline (Invitrogen), and trypsinized with 1
mL of 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, phenol
red. Trypsinization was stopped by adding fresh medium to the reaction.
The cells were washed twice by centrifugation with DMEM without serum,
resuspended in medium without serum, and plated at approximately 105 cells per well after proper cell counting in an improved
Neubauer chamber. They were incubated overnight to allow attachment
and then treated with 1.5 μg/mL amoxi@AuNP, 32 μg/mL amoxicillin,
37.5% PBS, and DMEM and irradiated with a white LED for 24 h. The
cells were kept in the dark for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity. MTT assay based on the reduction of tetrazolium
salt to formazan crystals in living cells was done according to a
Sigma protocol to determine the percent survival.57 The absorbance spectra on the different wells were measured
using a BioTek plate reader.

Hemolysis
The integrity of red blood
cells from human
healthy volunteers (from Córdoba, Argentina) incubated with
amoxi@AuNPs 1.5 μg/mL with and without irradiation was evaluated
following a procedure previously described58 with slight modifications. The amoxi@AuNPs had to be removed by
centrifuging the samples before reading the absorbance of the free
hemoglobin (541 nm) to avoid spectral interference. Measurements were
made at 0, 2, 5, and 24 h in triplicate. An aqueous solution of 0.9%
NaCl and H2O were used as negative and positive controls
of hemolysis, respectively.

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy
(FLIM) Study on Co-cultures
of Blood Cells and Bacteria
Acridine orange (AO) was employed
due to its characteristic fluorescence emission when intercalated
in DNA or RNA.59,60 FLIM imaging of the dye was introduced
as a method to check the viability of blood cells (anticoagulated
fresh samples from healthy volunteers from University of Córdoba)
and bacteria (107 CFU/mL of S. aureus 29213) cultured together and treated with irradiated and nonirradiated
amoxi@AuNPs (1.5 μg/mL). The samples were studied using a fluorescent
lifetime imaging system (FLIM, PicoQuant MicroTime 200). The instrument
was equipped with a frequency-doubled picosecond pulse diode laser
(440 ± 10 nm, 70 ps, 40 MHz, LDH-D-C-440, PicoQuant). The laser
beam was collimated and focused through a fiber-coupling unit. A beam
splitter Z440 bcm (Chroma) was used to reflect the excitation light
into the oil immersion total internal reflection objective (100×,
NA1.45, Olympus, PLAPO). The excitation dose (average power) is about
0.6 mW for all samples. Emission was collected between 610 and 680
nm using the ET645/75BP emission filter. Briefly, 100 μL of
the biological sample and 100 μL of AO (1 mg/mL) were mixed
and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Lifetimes longer than
5 ns were found for live bacteria and cells, whereas dead bacteria
or cells can be detected by a decrease in the emission intensity and
lifetime of unbound AO produced by disorganization of the spread genetic
material in necrotic or broken cells. Aliquots of the dye alone or
mixed with amoxi@AuNPs were also tested for fluorescence. Fresh samples
of blood cells or PBS suspension of bacteria in the absence of nanoparticles
were run as controls for “alive samples”. Accordingly,
the same samples were also heated up to 80 °C and imaged as “dead
samples control”. Furthermore, bacterial growth in the observed
samples was also ruled out by CFU counting in MH agar plates, whereas
integrity of eukaryotic cells was monitored by parallel hemolysis
measures.

Biodistribution of Nanoparticles
Male Wistar rats with
a body weight of 280–310 g at the time of drug administration
were maintained in the animal house facility at the Departamento Farmacología,
Córdoba, Argentina (food and water provided ad libitum at a
constant temperature of 22 ± 2 °C with 12 h by 12 h light
and dark cycle). The rats were handled for 1 week for acclimatization.
At the beginning, the rats were divided into three groups of two rats
each: group I was subjected to intraperitoneal injection with 34 μg/mL
AuNP, group II with 1.5 μg/mL amoxi@AuNPs, and group III with
physiological saline solution as control. After 2, 5, and 24 h post
injection, two animals from each group were anesthetized using a mixture
of 55 mg/kg ketamine and 11 mg/kg xylazine. Immediately, cardiac perfusion
with PBS (0.1 M) was carried out to remove all red blood cells from
their internal organs. Finally, after proper fixation (35 min perfusion
with 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS), the liver,
heart, kidney, spleen, and brain were harvested. TEM images were taken
with a TEM-Zeiss-Leo 906E microscope. All experiments on animals were
conducted complying the ARRIVE guidelines and were carried out in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised
1978) and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth
Edition, 2011).61

Biocompatibility with Blood
Cells
Prior to perfusion,
blood smears (triplicates) were made from fresh blood extracted through
a cardiac puncture.62 Samples were stained
with May Grunwald/Giemsa and analyzed under an optical microscope.
Results reported are the averages of quadruplicates. Student t-test was performed to detect differences that were considered
statistically significant when P values were lower
than α = 0.05.

Renal Clearance
At the same time
intervals (2, 5, and
24 h), urine was collected using metabolic boxes. The plasmon absorption
of the AuNP was measured by spectroscopy using a multiwell spectrophotometer
(BioTek), by centrifuging the collected urine and resuspending the
pellet in 0.5 mL of 37.5% PBS.
