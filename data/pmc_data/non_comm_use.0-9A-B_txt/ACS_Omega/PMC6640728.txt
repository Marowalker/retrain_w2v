Solvothermal synthesis, denoting
chemical reactions occurring in
metastable liquids above their boiling point, normally requires the
use of a sealed autoclave under pressure to prevent the solvent from
boiling. This work introduces an experimental approach that enables
solvothermal synthesis at ambient pressure in an open reaction medium.
The approach is based on the use of gold nanoparticles deposited on
a glass substrate and acting as photothermal sources. To illustrate
the approach, the selected hydrothermal reaction involves the formation
of indium hydroxide microcrystals favored at 200 °C in liquid
water. In addition to demonstrating the principle, the benefits and
the specific characteristics of such an approach are investigated,
in particular, the much faster reaction rate, the achievable spatial
and time scales, the effect of microscale temperature gradients, the
effect of the size of the heated area, and the effect of thermal-induced
microscale fluid convection. This technique is general and could be
used to spatially control the deposition of virtually any material
for which a solvothermal synthesis exists.

Introduction
Plasmon-induced nanochemistry (PINC) is
an active area of research
that benefits from the plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles
to enhance or enable chemical reactions on small scales.1 Three main features of plasmonic nanoparticles
have been involved so far in PINC: (1) the enhanced optical near field
of nanoparticles,2−4 which favors photochemical reactions in the vicinity
of the illuminated particles, (2) heat generation,5−10 which favors local chemical synthesis according to the Arrhenius
law, and (3) hot electron/hole injection,11−13 a recently
proposed mechanism leading to localized redox reactions. These multiple
facets of plasmonic nanoparticles provide a wide variety of tools
to develop new applications in nanochemistry. The aim of this work
is to introduce a novel approach in PINC based on the use of plasmonic
nanoparticles as nanosources of heat, enabling solvothermal reactions.

Solvothermal chemical synthesis relies on the use of superheated
liquid solvents, that is, liquids heated above their boiling point.
For water, it typically corresponds to temperature ranging from 100
to 380 °C. To prevent the solvent from boiling and to keep it
a liquid at such high temperatures, the standard procedure involves
the use of a sealed chamber, named an autoclave,
in which the temperature increase concomitantly creates a pressure
increase that maintains the solvent in a liquid state.

The interest
of a solvothermal (or hydrothermal) synthesis is manifold.
For instance, many organic compounds that are inert in liquid water
become reactive when the temperature is increased far above 100 °C,
especially reactions that occur only in the presence of strong acid
or base. Indeed, as temperature increases from 20 to 300 °C,
the ionic product of water increases by three orders of magnitude,
from 10–14.0 to 10–11.3. The resulting
higher concentrations of OH– and H3O+ simultaneously increase the rate of both acid- and base-catalyzed
reactions in liquid water far beyond the natural acceleration thermally
governed by the Arrhenius law. Moreover, the dielectric constant of
water decreases from 80.1 down to 19.7 over this range of temperature,
which results in a strong decrease of the polarity of water molecules
and in a natural rise of solubility of ionic compounds. Today, the
growing interest in using hydrothermal synthesis derives from its
advantages in terms of high reactivity of reactants, formation of
a metastable and unique solvent, and low energy consumption.14 The main constraint of such an approach relies
on the use of an autoclave, which prevents any chemical exchange and
monitoring during the reaction.

In this article, we show that
solvothermal synthesis can be achieved
under ambient conditions without requiring a pressure chamber when
heating is performed by illuminating a substrate patterned with metal
nanoparticles illuminated at their plasmonic resonance. Such experimental
conditions prevent the liquid from boiling, up to around 220 °C,
as recently evidenced in a previous work.15 We illustrate this approach with a well-established solvothermal
chemical reaction involving the synthesis of indium hydroxide microcrystals
in water. After describing the experimental conditions and the results,
we dedicate a final part to discuss the interest, the benefits and
the limitations of plasmon-assisted solvothermal chemistry (PASC).

Results
Liquid
Superheating Using Metal Nanoparticles
Under
illumination at their plasmonic resonance wavelength, metal nanoparticles
can turn into efficient heat sources. This effect is the basis of
an active field of research named thermoplasmonics,16 involving promising biomedical applications. We have recently
shown that, against all odds, water superheating can be achieved at
ambient pressure by heating plasmonic nanoparticles on a glass substrate
using continuous wave (cw) laser illumination.15 The geometry of the system is depicted in Figures 1 and 2. The sample was composed of a glass coverslip patterned with (1)
a uniform distribution of gold nanorings made by block copolymer micellar
lithography (BCML)17 (see Figure 1a) or (2) isolated gold disks,
500 nm in diameter and 40 nm thick, made by e-beam lithography (EBL)
(not shown).

profile related to image (b) averaged over 11 successive horizontal

Figure 2 Side view of the sample where the hydrothermal synthesis takes
place.

The coverslip was pasted on the
back of a drilled Petri dish, which
was filled with the reactants freshly dissolved in deionized (Milli-Q)
water (Figure 2). The
sample was finally placed on an optical microscope enabling optical
(intensity and phase) imaging, laser heating and temperature imaging
at the submicrometric scale (see ref (18) for details). Heating was performed by illuminating
the sample from below (i.e., from the glass side) using a laser beam
at λ = 800 nm, matching the plasmonic resonance wavelength of
the gold nanoparticles. When working with BCML samples, the beam profile
at the glass/water interface was expanded to obtain a uniform (not
Gaussian) beam with a diameter that could be adjusted from a few microns
to a few hundreds of microns using an iris (see Figure 1b). When working with EBL samples, the laser
beam was rather focused on a single gold disk using a 100× objective,
NA 1.3. In any configuration, water superheating was systematically
observed but we have never seen water boiling at 100 °C. Bubble
formation systematically occurred around 220 ± 10 °C, as
evidenced experimentally by the thermal microscopy technique we developed
(Figure 1b).18

The reason why water does not boil is
that this system is free
from nucleation points, such as scratches, micrometric cavities, impurities,
and so on. Glass surfaces are particularly flat by nature, and it
turns out that gold nanoparticles do not act as nucleation point themselves.15

Hydrothermal Synthesis
Hydrothermal
synthesis refers
to solvothermal synthesis where the solvent is water. To simply evidence
that solvothermal synthesis can be conducted at ambient pressure using
gold nanoparticles, we selected a hydrothermal chemical reaction19 that involves the formation of solid particles,
namely, the chemical transformation of indium chloride to indium hydroxide
crystals  Typical
crystals obtained with this approach
feature a cubic crystallographic symmetry, as evidenced in ref (19).

We initially prepared
a solution under the same experimental conditions as in ref (19). We dissolved 0.21 g of
InCl3, 9.4 mg of NaOH, and 12.5 μL of NH3 in 24 mL of water, which gave a concentration of cm = 40 mM InCl3. This solution was then diluted
10, 100, or 1000 times before being added into the Petri dish. Prior
to each experiment, calibration was made using our thermal microscopy
technique with pure water in the sample to determine which laser power
was required to reach 200 °C for a given laser beam size. Note
that the use of a thermal microscopy technique is not mandatory; if
a setup is not endowed with a means of temperature characterization,
it is possible to ensure a temperature of around 200 °C by setting
the laser power slightly below the laser power threshold for bubble
formation (supposed to be around 230 °C).

In our approach,
a set of four parameters can be adjusted, namely,
(1) the laser beam diameter D (i.e., the size of
the heated area in the case of BCML samples), (2) the temperature T0 (taken at the center of the heated area),
(3) the initial reactant concentration c0, and (4) the heating duration δt.

Reaction
Kinetics
We first conducted experiments upon
heating at T0 = 200 °C an area with
a diameter ranging from 430 nm (gold disk) to 500 μm (BCML sample). Figure 3 shows SEM (scanning
electron microscopy) images taken at the center of the illuminated
area where cubic In(OH)3 crystals have grown. Several important
observations can be made.(1) In comparison with the standard high-pressure
procedure, which yields the formation of isolated clusters of particles,
the local photothermal approach leads to a dense coverage of the substrate
where the crystals can be partially merged with each other. The dimension
of the crystals ranged from a few 100 nm to 4 μm, which is comparable
with common results obtained with an autoclave.

(2) The smaller the heated area, the faster
the reaction rate. For instance, when using a single gold disk, 430
nm in diameter, we observed a fast crystal formation (10 min) although
the reactant concentration was divided by a factor of 1000 (c0 = cm/1000). We
interpret this observation by the constant renewal of the reactants
in the confined heated volume because of Brownian motion, fluid convection,20 and thermophoresis.21−23 Indeed, the
micrometric reaction volume is in contact with a quasi infinite reservoir
of reactants (the rest of the liquid volume), which maintains the
reactant concentration constant during the reaction. Thus, one observed
kinetics with an effective 0th order, hence the faster product formation.
For further details on the origin of this effect, let us use the following
notations 1   2  For the sake of simplicity, we assume a first-order
reaction. In this case, the reaction rate r reads 3  where K is the rate constant
of the reaction. This differential equation yields 6   7   8  Now, if the heated volume is much smaller
than the size of the system, the concentration of InCl3 can be considered as constant because InCl3 molecules
are continuously renewed in the heated region by Brownian motion. Equations 3 and 5 yield 9  and
thus 10  The concentration of In(OH)3 is
thus linearly increasing as a function of time and no longer limited
by an exponential saturation, as in eq 7. This mechanism is inherently related to the geometry
of the system and can be seen as a natural Ostwald isolation.

(3) The theory introduced
above explains
that the larger the system, the slower the reaction rate. It is certainly
the reason why kinetics of crystal formation is so long with an autoclave,
which usually implies heating duration longer than 20 h. A benefit
of our approach is that we can observe the formation of crystals within
only a few minutes, with the same reactant concentrations.

(4) Too long an exposure time
(or too
high a concentration) yields the formation of pine-tree-like structures,
another type of structure (Figure 4b). Deviation from regular shapes for too long heating
duration was also mentioned in the literature.24 The reason was related to an Ostwald-ripening mechanism.
If heating is carried further on or if we reproduce the exact same
conditions of temperature, exposure time, and concentration as with
an autoclave, one even observes the formation of a large and smooth
dome (hemispherical structure) of the size of the heated area.

(5) It may seem surprising
that the crystal
products do not act as nucleation points for water boiling once they
are formed, even at 200 °C. We have never observed bubble formation
because of the formation of nano- and microcrystals. We believe that
a nucleation center must consist of a microscale cavity (a scratch)
rather than an asperity, a bump, to enable a flat initial curvature
radius of a nucleating bubble, that is, a small Laplace overpressure.
This is also the reason why the gold nanoparticles themselves do not
act as nucleation points; they look like nanoscale bumps rather than
microscale cavities.

(6) The heating dynamics can be as fast
as the time scale τ = L2/a, where L is the characteristic size of
the heated area and a is the thermal diffusivity
of the surrounding medium. For water, a = 10–7 m2·s–1. To give
an idea, if the size of the heated area is L = 10
μm, the heating time scale can be as fast as 1 ms.

(7) Locally heating a fluid possibly yields
fluid convection, even at the micrometric scale and especially when
superheating a fluid. If the heated area is less than a micrometer,
no strong convection is expected (less than a micrometer per second).20 However, for a larger heated area, up to 100
μm, substantial convection can be observed (several 10 s of
μm·s–1) and one can wonder what the effect
could be on the chemical reaction. Our results show that convection
does not affect the crystal growth. It should even favor kinetics
by faster renewal of the reactants in the heated region. Furthermore,
fluid convection is not supposed to affect the spatial steady-state
distribution of temperature because temperature diffusion always occurs
faster than thermal-induced fluid convection. This well-known effect
in fluid dynamics stems from a large Prandtl number of water (Pr ≈ 7).25

(8) Products remain located at the water/glass
interface, where the nanoparticles are located. This may be because,
in part, of the fact that it is where the temperature is the largest.
However, the surface could also nucleate the formation of crystals
by a heterogeneous nucleation process.

(dashed lines) and the areas corresponding to the SEM images (a) and
(b) (solid lines) have been indicated.

Effect of the Temperature Increase
A benefit of using
our approach is that any dependence on the temperature increase can
be easily studied. One can generate a temperature gradient on a single
field-of-view, spanning from 200 °C to ambient temperature, and
observe the morphological evolution of the formed crystals along the
temperature gradient. Figure 4 presents such a situation. The temperature gradient was measured
using our thermal microscopy technique and is displayed in Figure 4c. The resulting
crystal formation was imaged using SEM, as presented in Figure 4a,b. We chose a situation where
three different domains have been formed. The center domain, where
the temperature was close to 200 °C, features the pine-tree-like
structures observed when the heating duration is long enough (as mentioned
earlier). The intermediate area, ranging from 120 to 80 °C, is
covered with the cubic In(OH)3 crystals of interest. Finally,
the third zone is not covered with anything crystalline. Interestingly,
the transition from one zone to another is extremely well defined
and occurs at a precise temperature for a given heating duration.
For instance, in the present case (i.e., for a heating duration of
1 h), the transition from pine-tree to cubic shapes occurs at T = 120 °C, and cubic crystals do not form below T = 80 °C. We used a long exposure time on purpose,
to observe three domains. A shorter exposure time would have led to
cubic crystals in the center of the heated area and to no pine-tree-like
structures.

Noteworthily, in this experiment, one can see that
the formation of crystals can be achieved at much lower temperatures
than those expected (80–120 °C compared with 200 °C).
This observation highlights an additional interest on PASC; because
of enhanced kinetics, products can be obtained at reduced temperatures
within a reasonable time, even under nonhydrothermal conditions.

Discussion
Let us discuss the benefits of plasmon-assisted
solvothermal chemistry
(PASC) compared with those of using an autoclave at high pressure.
(1) PASC yields much faster reactions, as explained above, because
of an effective reduction of the order of the reaction by a natural
Ostwald flooding. (2) PASC can achieve much faster heating/cooling
dynamics, down to the microsecond scale. The temperature quasi-instantaneously
rises or drops as soon as the laser illumination is turned on or off
because of the weak inertia related to the small volume of the system.
(3) PASC enables the observation of product formation using optical
means, in real time (with a diffraction-limited resolution, not shown
herein). (4) PASC enables the introduction of reactants during the
reaction as the reaction medium is not sealed. (5) PASC makes the
study of the effect of the temperature increase straightforward. A
single experiment reveals the crystal morphologies over a full range
of temperatures. (6) An industrial application could be the laser-driven
microscale patterning of nano- and microcrystals, using a scanning
laser.

It is also worth discussing the benefits of using a layer
of gold
nanoparticles (as the one displayed in Figure 1a), compared with those of using a uniform
absorbing layer (like a metal layer for instance).26 The real interest does not rely on the fact that plasmonic
nanoparticles are much more absorbent. A substrate can be made nearly
100% absorbent without requiring plasmonic nanoparticles, and nanoparticles
will never do better than 100% absorption. Also, even if
the absorption is not large, the laser power can still be increased
to reach the desired temperature. The benefits of using nanoparticles
are the following. (1) The heated area can be much smaller than the
size of a focused laser beam, down to the size of a single nanoparticle.
(2) Metal films are highly reflective. With metal nanoparticles, it
is possible to make the light–sample interaction purely absorbent
(no scattering, no reflection, only absorption). (3) Depositing a
metal layer requires bulky and expensive apparatus, whereas metal
nanoparticle substrates (such as BCML samples) can be obtained using
chemical means and cheap bench-top devices. (4) Plasmonic nanoparticles
exhibit an absorption resonance in a finite region of the spectrum,
which makes it possible to heat the sample at a given wavelength range,
whereas the sample will remain transparent at other wavelengths. This
will make, for instance, observation easier using optical microscopy
techniques in the visible range upon heating in the IR range.

Let us now discuss the limitations of our technique. (1) It is
not meant to produce large amounts of products (for industrial or
commercial purposes for instance). It is rather intended to help fundamental
research on solvothermal synthesis or to yield applications in local
patterning of microstructures. (2) It is mainly of interest for solid-state
products. If the products remain as dissolved species, the interest
of PASC is not evident as the products will escape from the heated
area because of Brownian motion. However, the production of solid
products remains a major aspect of solvothermal synthesis, with a
myriad of applications, from the synthesis of microporous crystals,
ionic conductors, complex oxides and fluorides, low-dimensional aluminophosphates,
inorganic–organic hybrid materials, and particularly condensed
materials such as diamond and inorganic helical chains.14

Let us finally place the concept of PASC
in the context of the
state-of-the-art related to light-induced chemistry at the micrometric
scale.

The concept of photothermal-induced growth of nano- and
microstructures
on plasmonic nanoparticles was pioneered by Boyd and coworkers in
200627 and then further investigated by
other groups.28−30 The concept introduced by Boyd consisted of a new
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process in which local heating necessary
to induce the chemical deposition from a gas phase was performed by
local laser heating at the micrometric scale of gold nanoparticles
deposited on a substrate. The authors named this technique PACVD (plasmon-assisted
CVD). They demonstrated microscale patterning of metal oxides such
as PbO and TiO2 on a glass substrate by local heating up
to 150 °C. Their approach was, however, based on a gas environment,
not involving a liquid environment in a superheated state, like in
our study.

In 2009, Adleman and coworkers introduced the concept
of plasmon-assisted
catalysis (PAC) in a liquid environment. The authors chose to investigate
the thermal-induced reforming of a liquid mixture of ethanol and water,
leading to the formation of CO2, CO, and H2,
favored by the natural catalytic effect of gold nanoparticles.31,32 The experiments were conducted in a microfluidic channel to ease
the collection of the gas products. However, no fluid superheating
was involved in the mechanism.

In 2013, Yeo and coworkers26 reported
on the photothermal-induced growth of ZnO nanowires on a metal film
acting as a light-absorbing layer. This seminal article is closely
related to our work as the authors managed to grow microcrystals at
the microscale using a photo-hydrothermal effect. However, the authors
did not experimentally evidence fluid superheating (no temperature
was measured), and they did not benefit from the plasmonic resonance
of metal nanoparticles.

In 2015, Kwon and coworkers33 reported
on the photothermal-induced formation of metal-oxide (CuO and ZnO)
structures in aqueous precursor solution. Here, again the temperature
was not monitored and the authors did not benefit from the use of
plasmonic nanoparticles. Moreover, the authors did not manage to produce
crystalline structures, presumably because of the aforementioned issue,
which occurs when the reactant concentration is too high or the heating
duration is too long.

Conclusions
In summary, we report
on an experimental technique suited to conduct
solvothermal synthesis at ambient pressure, on a small scale, using
plasmonic nanoparticles acting as light absorbers and nanosources
of heat. We illustrate the principle with the synthesis of In(OH)3 microcrystals at 200 °C in liquid water. To evidence
the similarities and the differences compared with common high-pressure
experiments, the effects of several parameters have been investigated:
the reactant concentration, the magnitude of the temperature increase,
the heating duration, and the size of the heated area. Several singular
effects have been evidenced. (1) The smaller the heated region, the
faster the reaction, because of an Ostwald flooding effect. Although
an autoclave approach usually implies heating times longer than 20
h, one can achieve crystal formation within a few minutes using PASC.
(2) A long enough heating duration leads to another type of structure
(pine trees). (3) Reproducing the exact same conditions of temperature,
concentration, and duration as with an autoclave approach does not
lead to the formation of microcrystals. Because of too fast kinetics,
we rather observe the formation of a large, smooth dome. (4) The temperature
dependence on the crystal morphology can be investigated in a one-shot
experiment by creating a microscale temperature gradient. (5) Solvothermal
reactions that normally occur in a superheated fluid can be achieved
at much lower temperatures within a reasonable amount of time because
of much faster kinetics. (6) Microcrystal products do not act as nucleation
points for bubble formation and do not prevent the fluid from superheating.
(7) Microcrystal products remain located at the substrate/solvent
interface and do not diffuse in the surrounding solvent. (8) The presence
of thermal-induced microscale fluid convection does not affect the
crystal growth.

This work gives the guidelines for efficient
solvothermal chemistry
at the microscale at ambient pressure and could pave the way for new
approaches suited for fundamental research on solvothermal synthesis
or for practical applications in microscale patterning of nanostructures.
More sophisticated PASC approaches could further benefit from the
natural catalytic effect of gold nanoparticles.
