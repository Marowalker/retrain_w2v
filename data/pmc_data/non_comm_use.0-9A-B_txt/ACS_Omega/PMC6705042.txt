This
study describes a technical platform that allows us to measure the
pore-forming activity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the lipid
bilayer and estimate antimicrobial activity. We selected six different
AMPs of diverse species from urochordata to vertebrata and measured
the channel current signals using a microfabricated lipid bilayer
system. As a result of the electrophysiological measurements, we were
able to estimate the pore-forming activity and roughly predict the
antimicrobial activity although there was not a strong correlation
between the pore-forming activity and the variety of species. Our
method will be a unique tool for analyzing a wide variety of diverse
AMPs.

1 Introduction
Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are short, immunity-related peptides that act against
bacteria, viruses, and parasites and also have demonstrated an ability
to act against transformed or cancerous cells.1 AMPs are ubiquitous among eukaryotes, and the modes of action by
which these peptides interact with malignant cells and microbes are
diverse, such as follows: (1) interference with protein folding and
DNA, protein, and cell wall synthesis as endogenous activities2,3 and (2) pore formation in the cell membrane as an exogenous activity.4,5 Among them, pore formation in cell membranes has broad-spectrum
antibiotics with the membrane disruption. This physical activity will
be hard to make tolerance. A short (<50 a.a.) peptide that has
cationic amino acids initially binds to the bacterial surface because
it consists of an anionic lipid membrane. The binding peptide forms
an α-helical structure that is amphiphilic and constructs a
transmembrane structure; then, the peptide monomers are assembled
and form pores using “barrel-stave”,6−11 “carpet”,12,13 or “toroidal
pore”14−18 models.19 The AMP structure and mode
of action are conserved in large animals, for instance, those from
urochordata to vertebrata.20 In this study,
we attempted to understand the difference of pore-forming activity
depending on the species. To investigate this subject, we used electrophysiological
analysis to examine the pore-forming activity of AMPs.

We have
previously developed a method of directly observing and analyzing
pore formation using electrophysiological measurement in real time
with microfabricated lipid bilayer system (Figure 2).21−23 We were able to assign between
the channel current signals and the pore-forming models proposed previously.24 The barrel-stave model pore in which the rigid-ring
pore exhibits step-like signals. In contrast, the toroidal-model pore
exhibits multilevel current signals. The current signal, in this case,
fluctuates after jumping up and returns to the initial state. In the
carpet model, this model was assigned as an erratic signal, which
exhibits random, fluctuating current signals, whereas it could not
assign perfectly. Based on this method, we investigate the pore-forming
activities of a wide range of species from ascidiacea to mammalia.
We select six different AMPs:(1) Clavanin A (Cla, VFQFLGKIIHHVGNFVHGFSHVF, 23 a.a.)
is from Styela clava (a sea squirt).25

(2) Cecropin A (Cec, KWKLFKKIEKVGQNIRDGIIKAGPAVAVVGQATQIAK, 37 a.a.)
is from Hyalophora cecropia (a moth).26

(3) Pardaxin P5 (Par, GFFALIPKIISSPLFKTLLSAVGSALSSSGDQE, 33 a.a.) is
from Pardachirus marmoratus (a red
sea sole).27

(4) Magainin 1 (Mag, GIGKFLHSAGKFGKAFVGEIMKS, 23
a.a.) is from Xenopus laevis (an African
clawed frog).28

(5) SL-37 (SLGNFFRKARKKIGEEFKRIVQRIKDFLQHLIPRTEA,
37 a.a.) is from Hylobates moloch (a
gibbon).29

(6) LL-37 (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES, 37 a.a.)
is from Homo sapiens (a human).30



These peptides
are genetically distant except for SL-37 and LL-37, and the antimicrobial
activity with the α-helical structure and pore formation are
preserved in all AMPs. To estimate the relatedness of these peptides,
we describe the molecular dendrogram prepared by ClustalW as shown
in Figure 1a. This
diagram was created using peptide sequences because the genetic relationships
among them are unknown. Par, Mag, and Cec are relatively closely related.
Cla is isolated, and SL-37 and LL-37 are close, as was predicted due
to their inclusion in the same gene family (cathelicidin antimicrobial
peptide, CAMP family). These results mirror the tendency of the evolution
of a biological species. These AMPs have an amphiphilic structure
in the helices, commonly known as the helical wheel structure that
is shown in Figure 1b. Based on this molecular information, we investigate the molecular
basis of the pore-forming activity and its relations with antimicrobial
activity using electrophysiological methods in the context of biological
diversity.31

2 Results
2.1 Current Signal Classification
and Estimation of Pore Formation
The AMPs used in this study
form pores or defects in lipid bilayer membranes. The typical current
and time traces of Mag are shown in Figure 3a. Several shapes of the current signals
were observed as previously reported. We have already proposed the
assignment of these current signals into the molecular mechanism of
pore or defect formation in the lipid membrane. We are still trying
to improve this assignment, and they are updated in this study, as
described below.24,32(1) Step signal: In this type of current signal,
the current jumps up orthogonally and maintains a plateau state. This
signal can apply to the barrel-stave model wherein transmembrane peptides
are tightly assembled and form a rigid circular pore (Figure 3b).

(2) Multilevel signal: In this type of current signal,
the current fluctuates after jumping up and returns to the initial
state. This current may indicate a toroidal model wherein transmembrane
peptides form a pore with lipids. In this model, the size of the pore
can change dynamically with or without the participation of the lipid
between the monomers (Figure 3b).

(3) Erratic
signal: In this type of current signal, the current randomly increases
with fluctuation. We considered that this signal might indicate random
disruption behavior33 because there is
not a suitable pore-forming model. The random current behavior of
the erratic signal might be caused by the random size of the pore
or cluster (Figure 3b).

(4) Spike signal:
In this type of current signal, the current suddenly rises and then
returns to the baseline over a period of less than 20 ms. This signal
indicates an instantaneous membrane defect. We applied this signal
to peptide permeation through the membrane. Three different models
for direct penetration have been reported: pore formation, inverted
micelle formation, and carpet models.34 The pore formation was already assigned to other current signals.
Therefore, we assign the spike signal as the inverted micelle and/or
carpet model. The inverted micelle model suggests forming the inverted
micelle structure in the lipid membrane that encapsulates the peptides
and releases them into the cytosol by the inversion (Figure 3b). The carpet model has been
described as peptides that bind parallel to the lipid bilayer surface
and, after reaching sufficient coverage, unwrap lipids as a peptide–lipid
cluster from the membrane (Figure 3b).

The definition of the shape
of signals is shown in Figure S2.

mechanisms (these typical signals are from magainin). (c) Current
signal analysis and classification of six AMPs. (n = 243–681).

The signal classification
of all AMPs is presented in Figure 3b,c. In this classification, we eliminated the spike
signals to estimate the pore formation and to compare the pore formation
versus penetration. The step and multilevel signals reflected relatively
stable pore formation in the barrel-stave and the toroidal models.
In contrast, the erratic signals were assigned to the random disruption
model that elicited detergent-like membrane disruption. Cla yielded
notably unstable pore formation, whereas stable pore formation was
observed in more than 60% in the other AMPs. Next, we analyzed AMP
pore-forming capability by comparing stable pore formation and penetration
using the spike signals, which can be assigned to the direct penetration
of peptide molecules. The appearance ratio of [the penetration (spike
signals)]/[the pore formation (step + multi + erratic signals)] was
calculated to estimate the capability of pore formation. The order
of the ratio was Cec > Par > LL-37 > SL-37 > Mag >
Cla, as listed in Table 1. These results may imply the leakage activity of AMPs.

2.2 Analysis
of the Pore Size and the Ion Flux Via the Pore
The size of
the pore can be theoretically estimated using the channel conductance
of the step signals and Hille’s equation35 (Figure 4a).  Here, r is the pore radius, ρ is the resistivity
of the buffered solution in 25 °C, l is the
length of the pore (7 nm from the thickness of the lipid bilayer),
and R is the resistivity of the pore. R is calculated as V/I, where I is the current through the pore, and V is the applied voltage between two chambers. The diameter of the
pores ranges from 0.9 to 1.9 nm (Table S1), and the tendency is divided into two groups: (LL-37 ≥ Par
≥ Cla ≥ Mag) > (Cec ≥ SL-37). The number of
assembling monomers for constructing pores is mathematically calculated
using the pore diameter and width of the peptides’ α-helical
structure. Figure 4b shows a schematic illustration of the assembling monomers and the
hydrophilic region of each monomer that is estimated by examining
the number of hydrophilic residues compared to all residues (the number
of hydrophilic/entire residues). Larger pore size seems to correlate
with increasing hydrophilic region. However, mammalian AMPs have a
large hydrophilic region but exhibit a notable pore size difference
even in similar peptide sequences.

area indicates the total charge flux through the membrane pore or
defect. (d) Results of the charge flux in AMPs.

Charge flux (CF) through the nanopore reflected the ion flux (Figure 4c) and exhibited
similar behavior to that of lipid bilayer leakage.32 Therefore, it is strongly correlated with membrane dysfunction-related
antimicrobial activity. In these measurements, we set the threshold
value at 1000 pA; this value was established in reference to our previous
study of CF measurements.24 The order of
CF was Par > LL-37 ≥ Mag > Cec ≥ Cla > SL-37
(Figure 4d and Table S1). The results indicate a similar tendency
of pore stability.

2.3 Scoring on Pore-Forming
Activities and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of AMPs
To assess the pore-forming activity from several perspectives,
we examined the activity on a scoring basis. Each AMP was scored from
1 to 6 in each pore-forming parameter, such as the pore size and CF,
and the scores were determined as the sum of the score out of the
total possible score. We considered that this value could predict
the total pore-forming activity in the lipid bilayer, while the numerical
values of the scores do not have quantitatively. The total scores
are shown in Figure 5, and all values are listed in Table S1. The order of the total score was LL-37 > Par > Mag = Cec
> Cla > SL-37. In order to elucidate the availability of this
scoring, we compared the CF as the experimental value and the sum
of the score to pore size and stability. According to our understanding,
the value of CF should be strongly correlated with pore size and stability.
If there were large and stable pores in the lipid bilayer, the CF
would be large. The order of values were as follows: for scoring (size
+ stability), LL-37 > Par > Mag > Cec > Cla > SL-37;
for charge flux (experimental), Par > LL-37 > Mag > Cec >
Cla > SL-37. These orders were similar, suggesting the efficiency
of this scoring method.

Figure 5 Total score of pore-forming activity parameters:
pore stability, pore diameter, charge flux, and pore-forming activity.
Each element was scored from 1 to 6.

Finally, we investigate the MICs of all AMPs against Escherichia coli. We categorize three MIC activity:
high, middle, and low as MIC values exhibit intrinsic distribution
due to the discontinuous changes in the sample concentration. The
order of the antimicrobial activity from MIC measurements of each
AMPs is Cec ≈ SL-37 ≈ LL-37 > Mag ≈ Par >
Cla (Table 2). This
order seems to somewhat reflect the order of the total scoring.

3 Discussion
Our electrophysiological
methods and analysis are useful tools for evaluating the mode of action
of AMPs on pore formation and disruption in bacterial model membranes.
The pore-forming activities and stability are different in each AMP
(Table S1). The featured peptides and their
characteristics are listed as follows:Cla: pore-forming activity = low, stability = low

Cec: pore-forming activity = high, pore
size = small

Par: pore-forming activity
= high, pore size = large

Mag: pore-forming
activity = low, stability = high

SL-37:
pore-forming activity = low, stability = low, pore size = small

LL-37: pore-forming activity = high, stability
= high, pore size = large

Considering these
features, we found that the total pore-forming activities exhibit
an obvious correlation with the species difference, such as the activity
difference in young or old species.

The parameter scoring reflects
roughly AMPs’ antimicrobial activity against E. coli, whereas the scores are
not equal to the MIC values. The antimicrobial activity of these AMPs
used in this study is mainly considered as membrane disruption. The
score from electrophysiological measurements with the bacterial model
membrane, which is the sum of the membrane disruption abilities, can
predict the antimicrobial activity of the living bacteria. Similarly,
the permeability induced by AMPs in the model membrane (DOPC) is quite
similar to that in bacteria (spheroplast of E. coli).36 However, two unexplained results
remain: (1) The total score of Cec is in the middle position, while
the activity of MIC is the highest. (2) The pore-forming activity
between LL-37 and SL-37 is notably different even though they are
genetically close and have similar peptide sequences.

With respect
to Cec behavior, the precise antibacterial mechanism of Cec is still
argued. Recently, there is evidence showing that the membrane disruption
is the main activity of Cec.37 However,
another mechanism has also proposed that Cec induced apoptotic activity
with inducing the imbalance of ions.38 This
fact implies that there is some different mechanisms of antimicrobial
activity, and they should be the reason for the difference between
the scoring and MIC of Cec.

Next, SL-37 and LL-37 are from the
same gene family (CAMP), and their sequences resemble each other.
Although the value of their MICs seems to be similar, their scores
are quite different. Among the scoring parameters, we focus on pore
diameter because this parameter should reflect the assembling state
of peptide monomers. The values between SL-37 (0.9 ± 0.1 nm)
and LL-37 (1.9 ± 0.2 nm) are different; therefore, the number
of assembling monomers is also different at 5 mers (SL-37) and 9 mers
(LL-37). Both SL-37 and LL-37 exhibit an amphiphilic α-helical
structure, and their monomers assemble in a lipid bilayer oriented
so that the hydrophilic side faces the inside pore and the hydrophobic
side is directed toward the lipid phase, as shown in Figure 4b. To explain this stoichiometry,
we ascertain carefully the helical wheel structure and the position
of amino acids. Figure 6 shows the schematic illustration of the geometry of amino acids
in SL-37 and LL-37. The charges of the amino acids in the side region
of the hydrophilic area are changed from positive to negative, resulting
in an intensified electrostatic interaction between monomers in LL-37.
This electrostatic change may enhance the oligomerization of LL-37
monomers.39 Besides, the F score (packing quality of helix) of LL-37 (F =
730) is two times higher than that of SL-37 (F =
321) simulated by a web tool of “Prediction tool for an ensemble
of transmembrane α-helical dimer conformations” (PREDDIMER, https://preddimer.nmr.ru/preddimer/). These results also support the higher interaction in the LL-37
system.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we investigated the pore-forming activities of AMPs from diverse species
using electrophysiological measurements. The activities were divided
into four factors in terms of the stability and activity, and each
peptide was scored. The order of the total scores is LL-37 > Par
> Mag = Cec > Cla > SL-37. This order roughly reflects the
order of antimicrobial activity from MIC measurements against E. coli: Cec ≈ SL-37 ≈ LL-37 > Mag
≈ Par > Cla. Although there is no distinct trend between
pore-forming activity and evolution of the species, our method can
estimate antimicrobial activity using electrophysiological measurements.
In addition, it is found that the small difference of amino acid between
SL-37 and LL-37 induces large differences in pore-forming activity,
even in these genetically similar peptides. Moreover, our electrophysiological
system and analysis would be a useful tool for selecting the pore-forming
peptide in molecular evolution research.40,41

5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Reagents
In this study, we used the following reagents: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE; Avanti Polar Lipids,
AL, USA); 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DOPG; Avanti Polar Lipids); n-decane (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan); 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic
acid (MOPS, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan); potassium chloride (KCl;
Nacalai Tesque); clavanin A (GenScript); cecropin A (BACHEM); pardaxin
(abcam); magainin 1 (AnaSpec Inc); SL-37 (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.); and
LL-37 (AnaSpec Inc.). DOPE and DOPG were melted in n-decane at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and we obtained a lipid mixture
of DOPE/DOPG (3:1 mol/mol). The composition of the measurement buffer
was regulated so that it became 200 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS, and pH 7.0
in the Milli-Q system (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The clavanin
A, cecropin A, pardaxin, magainin 1, SL-37, and LL-37 powders were
dissolved in the measurement buffer and preserved at 4 °C.

5.2 Fabrication of Multichannel Device
One
of the multichannel devices measured 6 mm in height, 10 mm in length,
and 10 in width and was constructed using poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA; Mitsubishi Rayon, Tokyo, Japan). We designed these devices
using a RhinoCAM (3DS, Kanagawa, Japan) for computer-aided design
and used MM-100 (Modia Systems, Saitama, Japan) for cutting. The devices
have two chambers 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth. There is a gap
of 0.5 mm depth between the two chambers. Pores of 0.44 mm were cut
at the bottom of each chamber for electrode interconnection. We inserted
Ag/AgCl electrodes (Nilaco, Tokyo, Japan) in the pore and coated electrodes
by Ag/AgCl ink for the reference electrode (BAS Inc., Tokyo, Japan).
The parylene film was 5 μm thick, and a 100 μm pore was
made using photolithography. We adhered it between two PMMA (0.2 mm
thickness) plates that had a 1 mm pore and used it as the separator.
We used Super X (Cemedine Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as the glue. The
separator was fixed in the gap of the device using glue. The device
is shown in Figure 2. The electrodes were connected to a breadboard, which was in turn
connected to Jet patch-clamp amplifier (Tecella, CA, USA) with a jumper
wire (E-Call Enterprise Co., Ltd., Taipei City, Taiwan).

5.3 Preparation of Planar Lipid Bilayer
We prepared a planar
lipid bilayer using a liquid contact method in a multichannel device,
which was created using microprocessing.42 We obtained high-throughput data owing to multichannel devices’
ability to fabricate multiple lipid bilayers at the same time. We
used a micropipette (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at fabrication for
lipid bilayers in each chamber. After we added 2.3 μL of 10
mg/mL DOPE/DOPG (3:1 mol/mol) in n-decane solution
to each chamber, we added 4.7 μL of 10 μM peptide liquid
and 200 mM KCl liquid solution, allowing us to easily prepare the
planar lipid bilayer. The peptide was added to only one chamber to
which 100 mV voltage was applied to simulate the environment of living
cells. A few minutes later, monolayers in each chamber were contacted,
and a lipid bilayer was fabricated. When the bilayer was disrupted,
we reconstructed the lipid bilayer by tracing between two chambers
using a hydrophobic stick.43 We were able
to alter the lipid ratio voluntarily and fabricate model cell membranes
that imitated living cells. We used a bacterial model membrane (DOPE/DOPG
(3:1 mol/mol)), which has a negative charge. This membrane has a disordered
phase in this study because the phase transition temperatures of DOPE
and DOPG are −16 and −18 °C, respectively, and
the peptides can form the assembling structure in room temperature
(23 ± 1 °C).

5.4 Channel Current Measurement
Channel current was observed using a JET patch-clamp amplifier.
The measurement device had two electrodes. One side was connected
to the Jet patch-clamp amplifier and applied 100 mV of constant voltage.
Another side was grounded. As AMPs formed pores on the lipid bilayer,
ions passed through the pores. Thus, we observed this process as a
channel current. We measured current signals under the conditions
of gain 1 G, 20 kHz of the sampling rate, and 4 kHz of low-pass filter
in room temperature (23 ± 1 °C). Data were analyzed using
pCLAMP ver. 10.5 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and Excel (Microsoft,
Washington, USA). Data are described as mean ± SE unless otherwise
stated. The classification of current signals obtained from several
minutes to 2 h data was performed according to the previous definition
(Figure S2)24,44 with using
all data (n = 243–681, Figure 3b) and the same data numbers (n = 243, Figure S1). Both of these analyses
showed similar results. The pore size of AMPs was calculated using
the conductance of the step signal and Hille’s equation.35 Hille’s equation is based on simple Ohm’s
law and the diffusion equation, and it is conventionally used to estimate
the size of a pore or channel of ion channels,35 pore-forming toxin,45 and synthetic
channels44 because of the validity.

5.5 MIC Measurement
MIC measurement of clavanin A, magainin
1, and LL-37 were conducted by the Hygiene & Microbiology Research
Center. In the MIC measurements, the peptides were diluted as 100,
50, 25, 12.5, 6.3, 3.2, 1.6, 0.8, 0.4, and 0.2 μM and applied
to E. coli (NBRC 3972). The E. coli with AMP was cultured at 35 °C for 24 h and the MIC was measured
by the turbidity. After, the bacterial solution was prepared so that
it became 104/mL. We mixed the bacterial solution with
the Mueller-Hinton broth, and the potential bacterial increase was
checked by examining the turbidity after 24 h of incubation at 35
°C. The value of cecropin A,46 pardaxin
P5,47 and SL-3729 have previously reported and used the value in this study.
