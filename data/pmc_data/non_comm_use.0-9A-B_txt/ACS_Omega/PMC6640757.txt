Humic acid (HA), a natural polymer
and soil component, was explored
as a photosensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Photophysical
and electrochemical properties show that HA covers a broad visible
range of the electromagnetic spectrum and exhibits a quasi-reversible
nature in cyclic voltammetry (CV). Because of its abundant functionalities,
HA was able to bind onto the nano-titania surface and possessed good
thermal stability. HA was employed as a sensitizer in DSSCs and characterized
by various photovoltaic techniques such as I–V, incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE),
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization.
The HA-based device shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.4%
under 1 sun illumination. The device performance was enhanced when
a coadsorbent, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), along with HA was used
and displayed 2.4% PCE under 0.5 sun illumination. The DSSCs employing
HA with CDCA showed excellent stability up to 1000 h. The reported
efficiency of devices with HA is better than that of devices with
all natural sensitizers reported so far.

==== Body
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSSCs), regarded as one of the most
promising classes of photovoltaic devices, have been extensively investigated
because of their high theoretical efficiency, facile fabrication process,
and low cost.1 Commonly, the major components
of DSSCs are photoelectrodes, sensitizers, electrolytes, and counter
electrodes. Among these four major components, sensitizers definitely
play an important role as they are the origin of light harvesting
in dye solar cells. DSSCs exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE)
up to 13% by exploiting a porphyrine sensitizer and graphene nanoplatelets
as a counter electrode.2,3 Metal-based organic sensitizers
such as ruthenium,4 osmium5 polypyridin complexes, and D−π–A metal
free organic dyes6,7 have been used extensively as
efficient sensitizers. Synthesis routes of these sensitizers are often
composed of multistep processes followed by long, hard, and costly
chromatographic separation for purification. All of these lead to
the production of a large amount of synthetic waste, which has a bad
impact on the environment. In front of these sensitizer categories,
natural sensitizers and their derivatives are pronounced candidates
for environmentally friendly DSSCs because they are nontoxic, low
in cost, renewable, and abundant in nature. Additionally, because
of simple and cheap chemical/physical processing, natural materials
do not produce any hazardous byproducts. Thus, some natural resources
such as natural dyes have been investigated to convert solar energy
into electricity.8,9 These natural dyes are extracted
from vegetables, flowers, fruits, leaves, algae, etc., and they are
able to generate PCE between 0.01 and 1.7%.10 Low power conversion and instability are also the crucial weak factors
of natural dyes.

In view of this, we are introducing a naturally
abundant polymer,
humic acid (HA) (Scheme 1), as a sensitizer in dye solar cells, which can be extracted from
soil, wood, coal, or seawater.11,12 Soil has a very versatile
chemical composition, comprising thousands of organic as well as inorganic
elements. It contains a lot of essential metallic as well as nonmetallic
elements which are explored for their applications in a variety of
fields.13 One of the key components of
soil is HA, which is believed to be a product of transformation of
organic compounds. It may be defined as a mixture of high-molecular-weight
macromolecules (0.500–100k Da) of natural origin.14 A typical HA molecule contains aromatic rings
and aliphatic chains that host numerous carboxylic, phenolic, hydroxyl,
and other functional groups.15,16 There are some reports
that covered the electrochemical study of humic-based materials which
were also used to fabricate the working electrode for the determination
of trace metals in solution.17,18 In the early 1990s,
a report covered the use of anchored Suwanee River HA on a colloidal
TiO2 semiconductor for the reduction of oxazine dye.19 Recently, HA obtained from soil components was
introduced successively as a cathode host material in lithium ion
batteries because of its suitable functionalities.20

Scheme 1 Structure of the HA Substance and Its Physical Appearance
In this article, a natural
polymer, HA with abundant functionalities,
is used as a sensitizer in DSSCs. HA shows PCE up to 2.4% with chenodeoxycholic
acid (CDCA) as a coadsorbent under illumination of 0.5 sun. The device
shows Jsc around 6.6 mA/cm2, 49% incident-photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and
good stability. Unlike other natural sensitizers, HA shows longer
stability and comparative efficiency.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
HA, ethyl cellulose, α-terpineol,
iodine, lithium iodide, 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 3-methoxy
propionitrile, CDCA, and other required reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, India, and used as received without further purification.
Transparent conducting oxide (TCO)
glass and sealing tape were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland.
TiO2 (P25) particles were purchased from Degussa, Germany.
Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) used in this study were distilled
prior to use and stored under molecular sieves. The UV–vis
and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of HA were recorded in DMSO/DMF
(20:80) using a UV–vis spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan) and fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, USA), respectively. Electrochemical
measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), I–V, Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) experiments were carried out using a Solartron electrochemical
analyzer (SI 1286). CV was carried out using a three-electrode system
in which a Pt disk, Pt wire and nonaqueous Ag/Ag+ served
as the working, counter, and reference electrode, respectively, with
a TBAPF6 supporting electrolyte at 25 mV/s. However, Tafel polarization
data were collected by sweeping the potential from −0.4 to
0.4 V with a scan rate of 20 mV/s, under dark conditions. Photovoltaic
characterization (I–V) of
DSSCs was carried out by applying a potential to the device and measuring
the generated photocurrent under light illumination of 100 mW/cm2 using a solar simulator (Photoemission Tech., USA). The IPCE
of the devices was recorded using SR 300, Optosolar, Germany, where
a 250 W Xe lamp was used as the light source. EIS of devices under
dark conditions was measured between 50 Hz and 100 MHz under forward
bias. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out
using a TGA (SDT Q600, TA Instruments, USA).

DSSC Fabrication
TiO2 photoelectrodes were
prepared on a TCO substrate by a screen-printing technique using titania
paste. The paste consists of nanocrystalline TiO2, ethyl
cellulose, and α-terpineol.21 The
TiO2-coated electrode was calcined in a furnace at 500
°C for 20 min at a heating rate of 4 °C/min. The resultant
film has a thickness of around 10 μm. The electrode was allowed
to cool up to 80 °C and soaked in a 0.16% (w/v) solution of HA
in DMSO/DMF (20:80) for 48 h at 40 °C to ensure complete sensitization.
The same process was repeated with additional 0.05 mM CDCA as a coadsorbent
in the above composition. The HA-sensitized electrode was washed thoroughly
with DMSO and dried under the stream of warm air. A counter electrode
was prepared by a spin-coating technique using 50 mM chloroplatinic
acid (H2PtCl6) solution, followed by calcination
at 400 °C for 20 min. DSSCs were assembled in a sandwich-type
configuration and sealed using Meltonix hot melt sealing tape (thickness
60 μm). The electrolyte was inserted through the predrilled
holes on counter electrodes. The electrolyte consists of 0.5 M LiI,
0.055 M iodine, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine in
3-methoxy propionitrile. Holes on the counter electrode were sealed
using a cover glass and epoxy adhesive. All cells were stored in a
dark place for 24 h prior to photovoltaic measurements.

Results
and Discussion
Photophysical and Electrochemical Properties
of HA
The UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 1a) of 0.16% (w/v) HA in DMSO/DMF
were measured,
and the corresponding optical parameters are listed in Table 1. The spectra cover a maximum
visible range because of their blackish brown color (Scheme 1) with maximum absorbance at
461 nm. The UV–vis absorbance spectra of the dye-loaded TiO2 (Figure S1) are shown in Figure 1b. A slight hypsochromic
shift of 12 nm was noticed for the absorption maxima of the dye-loaded
TiO2 film in comparison with that of the dye solution.
This hypsochromic shift of the absorbance maxima is because of the
deprotonation effect when HA was anchored to the nanocrystalline TiO2 film.22

In addition, the amount of HA adsorbed on titania (area = 1 cm2) was measured by performing a desorption study in the presence
of aqueous NaOH. The UV–vis absorbance spectra before and after
desorption are given in Figure S2. From
this figure it is revealed that 0.02% (w/v) HA adsorbed on the titania
surface from the 0.16 % (w/v) dye bath. Hence, it is confirmed that
the presence of a good number of anchoring groups is responsible for
HA loading on the titania surface. Reports are also available that
explain the detailed structure of HA using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy and confirmed the presence of a large number of chemically
reactive oxygen groups, including carboxyl, phenolic, and alcoholic
hydroxyl groups in HA.20

The PL spectra
of 0.16% (w/v) HA in DMSO/DMF are given in Figure 2. HA exhibits maximum
emission at 550 nm and tailing up to 800 nm with an excitation wavelength
of 405 nm. Absorption and emission in the visible spectrum are associated
with conjugated unsaturated systems such as quinonoid-type cyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons with highly substituted carbonyl (C=O)
and carboxylic groups. Senesi et al. also reported a similar kind
of observation in the case of naturally extracted humic as well as
fulvic acid.23,24

Figure 2 PL emission spectra of HA in DMSO/DMF
(20:80).

Electrochemical properties of
HA were measured by a CV study with
a three-electrode system in DMSO/DMF solution at 0.16% (w/v) concentration
with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference
(Figure 3), and the
resultant data are listed in Table 1. The observed quasi-reversible redox wave can be attributed
to the oxidation of the aromatic-conjugated quinonoid portion of the
HA component. HA exhibits clear oxidation and reduction peaks compared
with other natural sensitizers, which reflects a more electron-rich
nature of HA. Hence, it shows an absorbance band at longer wavelengths
in UV–vis spectra. This gives an appropriate band
gap with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level above
the conduction band of TiO2 and highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) level below the redox potential of the I–/I3– redox couple, which facilitates
effective charge injection and dye regeneration, respectively (energy-level
diagram in Figure 3).

electrode (on left) and energy-level diagram of HA relevant to the
DSSC (on right).

The thermal stability
of HA was tested by thermogravimetric analysis
(Figure S3), and it found that HA is stable
up to 300 °C.

Characterization of DSSCs
Photocurrent-density–voltage
(I–V) plots of the devices
under illumination of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 sun are shown in Figure 4a. Additionally, dark current-density–voltage
curves of HA-based DSSC devices with and without CDCA are also depicted
in the figure. The figure reveals the remarkable difference in the
performance of devices sensitized with HA and coadsorbed with CDCA.
The photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE (η) were deduced
from these curves and are summarized in Table 2.

IPCE of DSSCs based on the HA and with CDCA.

Table 2 J–V Parameters
of HA and HA + CDCA Devices under Different
Light Intensities
dye	Pin (mW cm–2)	Jsc (mA cm–2)	Voc (V)	FF (%)	PCE (%)	
HA	100	5.3 ± 0.3	0.472 ± 0.010	56.6 ± 0.5	1.4 ± 0.1	
HA + CDCA	100	6.6 ± 0.7	0.524 ± 0.021	60.7 ± 0.7	2.1 ± 0.1	
HA + CDCA	50	3.7 ± 0.5	0.522 ± 0.020	60.8 ± 0.5	2.4 ± 0.1	
HA + CDCA	10	0.6 ± 0.4	0.520 ± 0.020	58.6 ± 0.5	2.0 ± 0.1	
The DSSC sensitized with HA produced Jsc = 5.3 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.472
V, and FF = 56.6% corresponding to a PCE of 1.4%. The data reveal
that HA itself is efficient as a sensitizer in the DSSC and the entity
responsible for binding in HA is considered to be quinine and/or carboxylic
acid groups. The PCE was further improved to 2.1% (Jsc = 6.6 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.524 V, and FF = 60.7%) using the coadsorbent, CDCA, under 100
mW/cm2 (1 sun) illumination. The same device delivered
2.4% PCE under 50 mW/cm2 illumination. A remarkable difference
in photovoltaic characteristics was observed in both the devices because
of the coadsorbed effect.2,26−28 The large and imbalanced structure of HA faces the problem of aggregation
and empty loops on the TiO2 surface. CDCA may alleviate
dye aggregation and suppresses the dark current as well as internal
quenching of the excited dye molecules. This combined effect of CDCA
enhances the performance of the HA device. The IPCE spectra of DSSCs
are shown in Figure 4b. The HA + CDCA device gives a higher IPCE value (49%) than the
pristine HA device. HA shows a good value of IPCE at ∼449 nm,
which indicates that it has a very efficient acceptor or anchoring
group. The higher IPCE value of the HA + CDCA-sensitized device, compared
with that of HA, indicates an enhancement in the photocurrent because
of the filling of small gaps between HA molecules by CDCA.

Further
insights into the electron transfer kinetics of these DSSCs
were obtained using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the
Tafel polarization technique. A typical Nyquist plot of the DSSC device
consists of three semicircles in a complex plane.29 The response of the AC signal is fitted using an appropriate
equivalent-circuit model to extract the desired parameters of electron
transfer reactions.

The impedance response of
the first depressed semicircle was fitted using a parallel resistor–capacitor
(RC) circuit (inset of Figure 5a) to estimate the charge transfer resistance. The observed
values of Rct are 25 and 39 Ω for
the device with HA + CDCA and HA, respectively. This suggests smooth
catalytic reactions at the Pt counter electrode. It can be seen from
the graph that the second arc is smaller in the case of the HA + CDCA-based
device, confirming a better charge injection than the corresponding
HA device. Further insight was obtained by the Tafel polarization
technique, which shows the kinetics of the reaction in the electrolyte
component of the dye solar cell under dark conditions (Figure 5b).30,31 The well-known Butler–Volmer equation (eq 1) was used to fit the Tafel polarization curves
that give information about rates of cathodic and anodic reactions
occurring at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface 1  where J0 is the
exchange current density, E is the applied voltage, Eeq is the equilibrium potential of the I–/I3– redox system, and
αa and αc are the anodic and cathodic
transfer coefficients, respectively. It is clear from this equation
that J = J0 as E = Eeq in the dark. Exchange
current densities for all of the DSSCs were estimated by fitting the
Tafel plot with Corrview software and found to be 1.0 and 0.025 μA
for HA and HA + CDCA, respectively. The intensity of the dark current
is directly related to the back electron transfer from the TiO2 matrix to the electrolyte component. Moreover, the higher
dark current would lead to the lower open circuit voltage because
of the recombination of electrons. This fact agrees well with the Voc obtained from Figure 4, which shows the highest PCE value for the
HA + CDCA-based device resulting from lower recombination. All remaining
devices exhibited similar results as obtained from photovoltaic measurements.

impedance response recorded in the dark under

Figure 6 covers
the stability of the best-performing HA DSSC devices with and without
CDCA. No appreciable degradation was noticed in all photovoltaic parameters
under illumination of 1 sun for 1000 h. Hence, HA-based devices unveiled
considerable efficiency and excellent long-term photostability.

Conclusions
HA, a natural polymer, has a photoresponsive
character and covers
a broad spectrum of the visible region. The abundance of functionalities
in the framework of HA allows it to anchor onto the titania surface,
which has been successfully employed as a thermally stable natural
light harvesting agent. The DSSC device sensitized with HA showed
1.4% PCE under illumination of 1 sun. An enhancement in PCE (2.1%)
was noticed when CDCA was used as a coadsorbent. An optimum 2.4% PCE
was achieved for the same device under illumination of 0.5 sun. The
said efficiency was good compared with that of other reported natural
sensitizers. Further, the modification in the structure of multifunctionalities
of HA may lead to an enhancement in efficiency. Hence, this work will
pave the way for utilizing soil components for the generation of energy
from sunlight.
