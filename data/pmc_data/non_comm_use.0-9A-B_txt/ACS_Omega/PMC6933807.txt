Many antibiotic resistances to penicillin have been reported,
making
them obsolete against multiresistant bacteria. Because penicillins
act by inhibiting cell wall production while silver particles disrupt
the cell wall directly, a synergetic effect is anticipated when both
modes of action are incorporated into a chimera cluster.
To test this hypothesis, the lipoate ligands (LA) of a silver cluster
(Ag29) of known composition (Ag29LA12)[3−] were covalently conjugated to 6-aminopenicillanic
acid, a molecule with a β-lactam backbone. Indeed, the partially
conjugated cluster inhibited an Staphylococcus aureus biofilm, in a dose–response manner, with a half-maximal inhibitory
concentration IC50 of 2.3 μM, an improvement over
60 times relative to the unconjugated cluster (IC50 = 140
μM). An enhancement of several orders of magnitude over 6-APA
alone (unconjugated) was calculated (IC50 = 10 000
μM). Cell wall damage is documented via scanning electron microscopy.
A synergistic effect of the conjugate was calculated by the combination
index method described by Chou–Talalay. This hybrid nanoantibiotic
opens a new front against multidrug-resistant pathogens.

==== Body
Introduction
Bacterial infections are the most important
cause of morbidity
and mortality worldwide, and in most cases the principal isolate is Staphylococcus.1 The main characteristic
of Staphylococcus aureus is its capability
to easily gain resistance against almost all antimicrobials.2 6-APA is the nucleus and the precursor for creation
of semisynthetic penicillins.3 Penicillin
acts against susceptible S. aureus by
targeting the transpeptidase that catalyzes the last stage in the
bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (peptidoglycan). The bacterial cell
wall is the rigid structure that maintains the characteristic form
of the bacteria and shelters against osmotic cell lysis.4 Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are the most studied
antimicrobials in nanotechnology demonstrating potent broad-spectrum
activity.5,6 The AgNP targets permeability of the bacterial
cell membrane, then after penetrating the cell, alters sulfur-containing
amino acids and phosphorus (DNA), hindering replication. Previous
research based on advanced electron microscopy showed that the positively
charged AgNPs induce wall thinning, pore formation, leakage of cell
content, and finally cause cell lysis.7−9 Once inside the cell,
the silver nanoparticles fall apart and generate highly reactive silver
species responsible for antimicrobial activity.5,10−13

A silver cluster comprising 29 Ag atoms and 12 lipoate ligands
(hydrodynamic diameter of 3 nm) was recently reported to be active
against methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteria (MRSA) and preformed Candida albicans biofilms.14 However, the modest inhibitory
concentrations reported in that study (140 μM level) limit the
use of the clusters to biomedical applications. Although small, the
cluster has a 13-atom metallic icosahedral core responsible for the
antimicrobial activity. Further size reduction results in inert nonmetallic
oligomeric structures that exhibit reduced activity.15 Conversely, larger silver particles (D > 10 nm) have a larger metallic core and are known to inhibit
at
lower concentrations (IC50 0.4–3.2 μg/mL).16,17 However, small silver particles (D < 6 nm) afford
advantages of enhanced stability and renal clearance with rapid and
efficient urinary excretion.18−21

A promising approach to enhance the antimicrobial
activity of the
cluster is to conjugate its ligands to a penicillin nucleus.3 As a proof of concept, 12 pendant carboxylates
of lipoic acid ligands in Ag12(LA)12[3−] may be covalently coupled (conjugated) to a penicillin nucleus known
as 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). An intermediate of penicillin
biological degradation,22,23 6-APA itself is ineffective
but retains the essential β-lactam backbone structure. The conjugated
cluster is, thus, expected to combine both the mode of action of penicillins
(inhibition of biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide)24 and the mode of action of silver nanoparticles (cell wall
disruption and lysis) while retaining the advantage of rapid kidney
elimination exhibited in vivo by small clusters.21

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
Claims of covalently conjugating penicillin
to nanoparticles abound in the literature.25−29 However, in most cases, proof of conjugation is provided
only indirectly through bioassays because large nanoparticles are
not amenable to analysis by mass spectrometry, the most useful analytical
technique for quantifying conjugation. For that reason, the few reports
that provide direct evidence of linkage through an amide bond are
for small clusters.30,31 One of the earliest reports demonstrated
that a known gold cluster molecule (“Undecagold” Au11(PPh3)7I3) could be obtained
in a water-soluble form and modified by conjugation of the Ph*-groups
to biomolecular groups.32 It formed abundantly
because it has eight (8) extra or “free” electrons that
occupy a closed-shell s2p6 configuration of
globular “superatomic” orbitals.33 The 29-Ag cluster employed here as a starting reagent similarly
exhibits an 8-electron closed-shell electronic structure responsible
for its remarkable yield and stability that facilitates further processing,
such as conjugation. R-α lipoic acid (LA or
RALA), also known as thioctic acid, is a natural product (an enzyme
cofactor essential to aerobic metabolism); as a dithiolate, it has
a high affinity to noble metals (Au, Ag, ...). The Ag lipoate (29,
12) cluster is abundantly produced via a borohydride reduction, as
summarized in Scheme 1:14,34−36

Scheme 1 Reduction of Silver
Salt by Sodium Borohydride in the Presence of
Lipoate (LA) Ligand under Alkaline Conditions
LA and reducing agent
are added
in 2.5:1 molar excess relative to silver.

The chemistry for conjugating a carboxylate group to an amine group
has been amply described in the literature.31,37,38 The major role that lipoic acid plays in
biological reactions has motivated extensive research in conjugating
it to molecules of therapeutic interest.39−43 The reaction employed in this study is summarized
in Scheme S1 of the Supporting Information.
Evidence of conjugation of 6-APA to the cluster is provided here (Figure 1B) by electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The ESI-MS signal from the
unconjugated cluster is observed at a mass-to-charge ratio that corresponds
with isotopic resolution6,14 to its triply charge
state [3−], as expected from its natural ionized state (Scheme 1).

Figure 1 Negative mode ESI-MS
of the cluster (Ag29LA12)[3−] [∼5.6 kDa] before (A) and after (B)
conjugation. (A) ESI-MS for the unconjugated cluster (triply charged)
labeled with the number of 6-APA groups (p = 0, 1,
2, 3, ..., 7, 8, ... 12-max). The adducts in the first spectrum (no
reaction) are sodium and triethylamine. (B) Evidence for the conjugation
of up to eight lipoic acid ligands. The bare triply charged parent
mass is observed at 1867.9 amu at 10% abundance. The remaining 90%
of clusters are conjugated.

Like oligonucleotides, metal clusters show a propensity
to form
adducts; this is evident from Figure 1A that shows the presence of sodium and/or triethylammonium
cations substituting the carboxylic hydrogen in the lipoic acid terminus.
Nevertheless, the signal from the parent cluster dominates the spectra
indicating that any antimicrobial activity is attributable to the
Ag29LA12[3−] complex.

It is of interest to note that as expected when the spectrometer
is operated in negative mode, the signal corresponds to some ligands
being deprotonated (as lipoates) or, to a lower extent, neutralized
by a cation adduct (lipoate salts). Solubility in aqueous solution
requires the deprotonated charge state (lipoate). This observation
is significant because pH plays a fundamental role in its conjugation
chemistry and on its use as an antimicrobial agent.38,44 The cluster must remain in aqueous solution at physiological pH
and ionic strength.

The cluster Ag29LA12[3−] was conjugated in a two-step process, as detailed
in Schemes S1 and S2 of the Supporting
Information
and summarized in the Experimental Section. Crucially, the efficiency of the coupling reaction was increased
remarkably using the free-base form of the coupling agent and by increasing
the buffering capacity [2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid, MES, 500 mM]. Much lower yields were observed when 50 mM MES
was used, all other parameters being equal.

Post-reaction, the
ESI-MS spectrum (Figure 1B) shows evidence that over 90% of the clusters
are coupled to the penicillin precursor, i.e., the signal from the
parent unconjugated cluster (N = 0) is less than
10% of the total signal (Figure 1B) as judged from integrating the areas under each
peak. It is evident that up to 8 ligands per cluster have been conjugated
out of a maximum of 12 ligands. The abundance from the conjugated
clusters conforms to a slightly long-tailed distribution with a mean
of 2.7 and a standard deviation of 1.6.

Partial conjugation
at the level demonstrated in Figure 1 may be advantageous relative
to full conjugation. The cluster remains water soluble (the conjugated
ligands are less polar and nonionizable). In addition, the cluster
retains the lipoic acid moiety that is compatible with the phospholipid
bilayers of the pathogenic targets, an essential feature that allows
the cluster to approach the cell wall and membrane. Indeed, these
solubility effects are noticeable and put to good use in the workup
procedure. The first steps of conjugation (Scheme S1) lead to the formation of a stable ester that precipitates
from the reaction due to its lower solubility facilitating its isolation
and the removal of isoureas side products and other impurities from
the activation reaction. In addition, isolating the stable NHS [N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide] ester is important because it
allows for the amidation reaction to occur at a higher more favorable
pH.38

The solubility of the cluster
also decreases as each free carboxylate
anion is replaced by an amide bond as conjugation proceeds. The conjugated
cluster precipitates from solution, and thus allowing the removal
of additional impurities. Increasing the pH deprotonates unconjugated
ligands and the cluster becomes soluble once again. Although the antibacterial
action of the conjugated cluster is expected to increase with an increasing
degree of conjugation, the advantages discussed above would be compromised.
It is also important to note that higher reaction pH minimizes the
degradation of the β-lactam ring that occurs at lower pH.45,46

To optimize reaction conditions with an amine more stable
than
6-APA, the conjugation reaction was performed with glycine ethyl ester
as a 6-APA surrogate. Surprisingly, the glycine ethyl ester also attaches
to up to eight lipoic acid ligands. A much stronger ESI-MS signal
(as shown in the Supporting Information) was observed, albeit with monotonous decaying abundances. Conjugation
of eight ligands leaves four ligands in the native lipoate form. In
addition to imparting solubility and biocompatibility to the clusters,
four ligands may play a role as four internal coordinating ligands
essential for the stabilization of the tetravalent cluster.14,47

The total structure of the bare aqueous cluster is not known
but
is inferred from theoretical calculations that take the structure
of the nonaqueous homolog as a starting point.47 Theoretical calculations14 reveal
the presence of four electron-deficient silver atoms tetrahedrally
arranged at the surface of the cluster that are stabilized by weakly
coordinated ligands in the nonaqueous analog.47

In continuing work, it will be possible to isolate specific
species
with a fixed number of conjugated ligands using high-performance liquid
chromatography, as demonstrated and detailed in the Supporting Information in the conjugation of glycine ethyl
ester to the cluster. This will allow the efficacy and stability to
be studied systematically as a function of the extent of conjugation
(from one to eight or more ligands). Other antimicrobials or moieties
with a free amine group may conjugate to Ag29. For example,
ampicillin was successfully conjugated following the protocol (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Biological Evaluation
By a luciferase assay, we obtained
the IC50 for 6-APA, Ag29 cluster, and the conjugate
against the S. aureus biofilm as follows:
10 000, 140, and 2.3 μM, respectively (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Phenotypic assay for S. aureus preformed
biofilm inhibition. (A) Inhibition by 6-APA, (B) inhibition by Ag29 cluster, and (C) inhibition of the cluster conjugate (Ag29 + 6-APA). Error bars represent ± standard deviation
(SD) from the mean of three independent assays in duplicates each.

6-APA alone needs a large quantity of the compound
to inhibit,
as it is only a nucleus used to develop a new generation of penicillins,
and the Ag29 cluster has effectivity against the biofilm
in the order of micrograms. The conjugate (Ag29 + 6-APA)
requires a small quantity of the cluster to be effective.

The
mechanism of antimicrobial action of nanoparticles, in general,
has been amply studied and reviewed.48 What
sets the subject cluster apart is its enhanced efficacy and versatility
attributed to the synergetic effect of its individual components in
attacking the microbial cell wall (CW) and cell membrane. The bioaffinity
of the lipoate ligand allows the cluster to permeate microbial biofilms,
CW, and phospholipid membranes. In addition, the β-lactam moiety
of penicillanic acid derivatives allows the clusters to weaken the
microbial CW. Once the microbial defenses are broken, the cluster
disintegrates into silver ions with the concomitant generation of
reactive oxygen species2 that degrade the
cell’s DNA and protein, essential to the microbes’ existence.

The increased antimicrobial activity of the conjugated cluster
can be explained as activation of the cluster or as activation of
the β-lactam backbone. An example of the latter is provided
by the coupling of 6-APA to borane clusters that results in increased
activity against S. aureus.49 Combination drug therapy is the action of many
drugs in combination to achieve synergy; this is frequently used against
antibiotic-resistant infections. Synergy is defined as the interaction
of two or more antibiotics to achieve a combined antimicrobial effect
greater than the summation of their efficacies alone. The theorem
of Chou–Talalay50 uses algorithms
for automated computer simulation to quantitatively measure synergy,
as shown in a plot of the degree of inhibition or fractions affected
(Fa) versus combination index (CI).51 The
index compares the inhibition predicted by the mass-action law when
the components are combined at various proportions to the actual inhibition
observed at the same proportions. An index of one indicates an additive
effect. Synergism is indicated when the index is less than one. Antagonism
is indicated when the index is greater than one.

To corroborate
that the conjugate has a synergistic effect compared
with the effect of Ag29 or 6-APA alone, we implemented
the Chou–Talalay method50 using
the CompuSyn 1.0 software. A constant mixing proportion of 2.7 moles
of 6-APA to 1 mole of the cluster was estimated from the average degree
of conjugation experimentally determined from the mass spectra (2.7
ligands/cluster, Figure 1). Knowledge of the cluster composition (Scheme 1) allows the calculation of the molarity
of the cluster used to report antibiotic dose. The Fa–CI plot
from the computer simulation is presented in Figure 3 and detailed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Median dose (IC50) and other parameters reported by curve fitting the phenotypic assay
results (by the CompuSyn 1.0 program) are summarized in Table S2. All doses used in this test for the
Ag29–6-APA conjugate demonstrated a synergist effect.

Figure 3 Fa–CI
plot. The data are the mean values from three independent
experiments. Combined doses of the conjugate (Ag29 cluster
and 6-APA antibiotic) ranging from 0.032 to 20.8 μM, resulted
in CI < 1 (synergy) ranging from 0.00044 to 0.012. Combination
indexes are plotted on a logarithm scale for easy comparison to the
CI = 1 limit between synergistic or antagonistic effects.

To visualize the ultrastructural effect of the
cluster, 6-APA,
and the conjugate against the S. aureus biofilm, we used scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the nontreated
cells were abundant, clustered, round, with a smooth surface and with
some extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) characteristic of the
biofilm (Figure 4a).
After 24 h treatment with Ag29, some cells become distorted
and AgNPs accumulate on the EPS (Figure 4b). Bacterial cells treated with 6-APA have
mild distortions on the outer cell surface of the membrane (Figure 4c). After treatment
with the conjugate, the cells become distorted, with disruption of
the outer cell membrane and leakage of the cell content (red arrows),
as shown in Figure 4d.

Figure 4 SEM microscopy of the S. aureus preformed
biofilm. (a) Untreated preformed biofilm, (b) preformed biofilm treated
with Ag29 clusters at concentration, (c) biofilm after
6-APA treatment at 12 mM, (d) preformed biofilm of S. aureus after 24 h treatment with the conjugate
(0.11 mM). Red arrows indicate disruption of the outer cell membrane.

It should be noted that the microbiological assay
reported here
was NOT performed against a methicillin-resistant S.
aureus bacteria (MRSA). However, the assay was performed
against a preformed biofilm, which is more antibiotic resistant than
in the planktonic form. In future work, we anticipate a similar enhancement
in activity when the conjugated cluster is tested against MRSA.

The antimicrobial efficiency of the cluster can be further optimized
by controlling the cluster charge, the degree of conjugation, the
length and shape of the penicillanic acid derivative, and the cluster
concentration. Furthermore, once absorbed into the microbe, the cluster
activity can be controlled by judicial exposure to light, heat, and
pH. The conjugated cluster may be used in topical applications (i.e.,
wound infections, surface disinfection, catheter protection).

Conclusions
Incorporation of a β-lactam moiety
(6-APA) to a silver cluster
of known composition results in a 60-fold enhancement in its activity
against a preformed S. aureus biofilm,
as demonstrated by in vitro susceptibility methods and electron scanning
microscopy. Evidence for conjugating and averaging of 2.7 ligands
per cluster and up to eight ligands is supported by electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry.

Ongoing work includes conjugation of the
ligand in the organic
phase, cluster conjugation via ligand substitution reactions, and
testing antimicrobial activity against MRSA superbugs and against
a wider range of substrates. In addition, the conjugation of the isolated
ligand and its subsequent incorporation into the cluster via place
exchange reactions is being investigated. The methods described here
are significant because they may be extended beyond penicillins to
a plethora of existing antiviral agents or other antibacterial agents
with different modes of action. The application of other coupling
modes (disulfides, organosilanes, phosphate esters, etc.), other metals
with antimicrobial activity (Cu), and the alloying of clusters with
biocompatible metals (Ti) is also within reach.

Experimental Section
Cluster Synthesis and Its Conjugation
First, the (Ag29LA12)[3−] cluster (hereafter
Ag29) was prepared and characterized as described previously.14 The raw cluster solution was purified by sequential
washing with acetone followed by extraction with methanol. Mass analysis
was performed in a Bruker micrOTOF time-of-flight mass spectrometer
operating in negative mode, loop injection, 50:50 methanol/water solvent
flowing at 10 μL/min (for other details, see the Supporting Information).

The cluster was
conjugated to 6-APA in two steps as depicted in Scheme S1 (Supporting Information) using free-base EDAC [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide]
as a coupling agent and sulfo-NHS [N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide]
as a catalyst. The sulfo-ester intermediate may be precipitated and
washed free of unconjugated reactants by controlling the pH. Once
cleaned, the sulfo-ester cluster is redispersed in solvent by increasing
its pH and subsequently reacted with the penicillanic derivative.
The use of the free-base form of the activating agent was essential
in conjugating the cluster. Numerous trials of the same reaction using
the salt form or the HCL form of EDC were unsuccessful despite the
in situ addition of two molar equivalents of the base. However, no
such difficulties were encountered when conjugating the bare ligand
(unattached to the cluster). Also, the 500 mM MES concentration was
important to ensure the solubility of excess coupling agent and to
control the pH at optimal conditions.

Bioassay and Microscopy
To measure inhibition on a
preformed biofilm, we performed a phenotypic assay with some modifications.52 Briefly, strain of S. aureus UAMS-1 was cultured at 37 °C for 24 h on selective plates (ChromAgar
BD Biosciences), subcultured in tryptic soy broth (TSB) liquid media
on an orbital shaker at 37 °C for 18–24 h. Cells were
resuspended in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium enriched with 10%
human serum (HS) at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cultures
were sedimented by centrifugation (3600g) for 15
min, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in BHI and adjusted the
density of the cell suspension to 1 × 107 CFU/mL.
Sterile 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates (Falcon, Franklin
lakes, NJ) were inoculated with 100 μL of the bacterial suspension.
Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow biofilm formation
and attachment, the culture supernatant from each well was decanted,
and planktonic cells were removed by washing with PBS. After the washing
steps, 2-fold serial dilutions were prepared in the 96-well polystyrene
tissue culture plate containing BHI at a final volume of 100 μL
per well. The final concentration of the Ag29 cluster (12–0.19
mM), 6-APA (48–0.10 mM), and the conjugate (6-APA 48–0.10
+ Ag29 cluster 0.600–0.0011 mM) with medium without
the agents as the nontreated control and the medium alone as the blank
control. The viability of the biofilm on each individual well quantified
by a luciferase viability assay (Presto blue) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Visualization of S. aureus Biofilm
by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Ultrastructural visualization
of the inhibition of S. aureus biofilm
was performed by SEM as in ref (14), in 6-well plates (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) with
the mature biofilm treated with 6-APA, the conjugate, or Ag29RALA12 for 24 h at 37 °C. After treatment, the biofilms
were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde
in PBS at room temperature. 6-APA, the conjugate, and Ag29RALA12 were used at a concentration previously calculated
to be the IC50. The samples were washed twice in PBS and
post-fixed at room temperature in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4). For the drying of the samples, we used a graded ethanol series
(25, 50, 75, and 95% ETOH). The dried specimens were then placed on
copper grids to be observed with SEM in a Hitachi S-5500.
