Six ionic liquid
(IL)-forming ions (choline, tetrabutylphosphonium,
tetrabutylammonium, and trimethylhexadecylammonium cations, and chloride
and docusate anions) were paired with acyclovir as the counterion
to form four low melting solid salts and two waxes; five of these
compounds could be classified as ILs. All of the newly synthesized
acyclovir ILs exhibited increased aqueous solubilities by at least
2 orders of magnitude when compared to that of neutral acyclovir.
For three of the prepared compounds, the solubilities in simulated
body fluids (phosphate-buffered saline, simulated gastric, and simulated
intestinal fluids) were also greatly enhanced when compared to that
of neutral acyclovir. Acyclovir in its anionic form was more water-
or buffer-soluble than acyclovir in its cationic form, though this
might be the effect of the particular ions, indicating that the solubilities
can be finely tuned by proper choice of the cationic or anionic form
of acyclovir and the counterion paired with it.

Introduction
Acyclovir
(9-[(2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]guanine), a nucleoside analogue of the
guanosine family, is the most commonly used antiviral drug.1 It is primarily used in tablets, topical creams,
intravenous injections, and ophthalmic ointments as an anti-Herpes
drug.2 Although widely used, neutral acyclovir
suffers from limited solubility in water (1.2–1.6 mg/mL at
22–25 °C3,4), and its absorption into the
gastrointestinal tract is only 10–30% of an oral dose, with
the low systemic bioavailability being a result of this limited aqueous
solubility and low permeability.4−7 Because of such low bioavailability, it has to be administered in
very high doses (from 200 to 1000 mg three to four times daily) or
intravenously.8 In addition, acyclovir
exists in multiple polymorphic and solvate forms, four polymorphs
and two hydrates, each reported to have different dissolution rates.3,9,10

Several active strategies
are currently being explored to improve
acyclovir bioavailability. The most common strategy is the formation
of acyclovir prodrugs (e.g., esters11),
such as valacyclovir, the valine ester of acyclovir, which has an
oral bioavailability that is 3 times higher than that of acyclovir
itself (ca. 55%).12 Although efficient,
the prodrug approach involves multistep synthesis with chemical modification
of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and requires either
metabolic activation or hydrolysis in the body for the prodrug to
be converted to the final active drug form.

Another common strategy
used by the pharmaceutical industry to
overcome acyclovir’s low solubility is to use microemulsions
as delivery strategies (often stabilized by surfactants).13,14 ILs can also be used as a solvent delivery vehicle as they can be
tailored to solvate a specific drug, increasing its concentration
for delivery,15 or providing otherwise
low shelf-life drugs with stability, and contributing to the delivery
of many “hard-to-dissolve” drugs.16−18 For example,
McCrary et al. described an IL delivery system for poorly water-soluble
amphiphilic APIs and demonstrated its suitability for solubilization
of amphotericin B and itraconazole.19 For
acyclovir, Moniruzzaman showed the use of IL microemulsions for transdermal
delivery using dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([C1mim][(MeO)2PO2]), in which acyclovir was dissolved 500 times more efficiently than
in water, although diffusion of the drug into the skin was negligible.20 Further addition of an oil phase to the system
created an IL-in-oil microemulsion, resulting in topical and transdermal
drug delivery that was 6 times greater than that of current acyclovir
creams.20 Although the approach of using
ILs for solubilization can offer an improvement in API delivery, the
obstacle in using ILs as a solvent for APIs remains the mostly unknown
toxicity profiles of the majority of ILs under study.

The formation
of acyclovir salts or co-crystals with higher solubility21 is also actively being investigated. As acyclovir
is amphoteric, both acidic and basic approaches have been utilized
for salt formation,22 and acyclovir salts
derived from metal cations (e.g., sodium or lithium22) or some pharmaceutically acceptable anions (e.g., nitrate,23 arylsulfonates,24 or maleate21) have been well investigated.
Nonetheless, although the aqueous solubility of acyclovir sodium is
70–80 times higher than that of acyclovir, formation of acyclovir
salts has been focused on the crystalline salt forms, with all of
the advantages and disadvantages of solids.

We and others have
previously reported on the IL approach to transform
solid pharmaceuticals into their liquid salts (ILs,
API–ILs, liquids at or below the average body temperature of
37 °C)25−27 where the state of an API (liquid vs solid) has a
direct effect on API solubility.28,29 However, perhaps
because of the pharmaceutical industry’s reliance on crystalline
forms of APIs,30 there appears to be no
work on forming acyclovir API–ILs either as a cation or as
an anion. Here, we explore the use of the IL approach to increase
the water solubility of acyclovir and report the synthesis, characterization,
and solubility (aqueous and in physiological fluids) of acyclovir
ILs.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Based on its amphoteric
character, acyclovir
(Figure 1), which possesses
two acidic protons (pKa1 = 2.27; pKa2 = 9.2531,32) and two nitrogen basic
sites (pKb not experimentally determined
but typical values for guanine and imidazole bases are reported to
be 0.433 and −0.5,34 respectively), can be easily both deprotonated and protonated
to form the corresponding anion or cation. In this study, acyclovir
ions were paired with permanent IL-forming counterions to form acyclovir
ILs. The choline cation ([Cho]+) was selected due to its
hydrophilicity and safety as it belongs to the “generally regarded
as safe” (GRAS) list,35 the Food
Additive List,36 and the Everything Added
to Food in the United States (EAFUS) list.37 It is also well known that the aqueous solubilities of choline-based
salts of APIs are substantially higher than those of the neutral parent
drugs; for example, in a recent study, we showed that choline sulfasalazine
not only exhibited increased solubility but also bioavailability and
improved oral exposure (compared to those of the nonmodified drug).29

Figure 1 Synthetic scheme for 1–6.

Three other cations, tetrabutylphosphonium
([P4,4,4,4]+), tetrabutylammonium ([N4,4,4,4]+), and trimethylhexadecylammonium ([N1,1,1,16]+), were selected for their additional biological activity
(antibacterial
activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, viruses,
protozoans, and fungi)38 to complement
the antiviral activity of acyclovir. In addition, these three cations
possess surfactant/membrane-disruptive properties due to the presence
of long alkyl chains.

Two anions, docusate and chloride, were
chosen to pair with acyclovir
in its cationic form. The docusate anion ([Doc]−) was chosen for its emollient activity, and to improve the absorption
and membrane transfer of the drug if applied transdermally. The chloride
anion ([Cl]−), one of the most common anions used
in pharmaceutical salts,39 was chosen as
an intermediate to allow ready metathesis to the docusate salt.

Compounds containing the acyclovir anion ([Cho][Acy] 1, [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4) were synthesized via acid–base reactions between acyclovir
hydrate and the hydroxide salts of the desired cations, using water
or methanol as the reaction medium. Clear solutions were obtained
after stirring for 0.25–1 h at room temperature, concentrated,
then dried under reduced pressure to afford either a wax ([Cho][Acy] 1) or low melting crystalline powders ([P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3,
and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4). Acyclovir hydrochloride
([H2Acy]Cl 5) was obtained as a crystalline
solid by reacting equimolar amounts of neutral acyclovir and HCl,
and used as a precursor for preparing acyclovir docusate ([H2Acy][Doc] 6). The docusate [H2Acy][Doc] 6 was obtained by a metathesis reaction between [H2Acy]Cl 5 and silver docusate (Ag[Doc]) via stirring
the mixture of their equimolar amounts in the dark overnight followed
by filtration through Celite and solvent evaporation, yielding a white
wax. All of the compounds were obtained in high yields (>93%) and
with high purities (>95%), as determined by NMR and Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Purity was determined using 1H NMR integration and evaluation of satellites in 13C
NMR (satellites from the peaks, if present, indicate that any peaks
lost in noise have to be less than 0.5% of the intensity of the main
peak). No remaining starting materials or remaining solvent were observed
after isolation of the compounds in the corresponding 1H NMR spectra, and there were no signals in the NMR spectra without
reasonable attribution. In addition, all but one reaction did not
result in any inorganic impurities; however, the metathesis of [Acy]Cl
to [Acy][Doc] resulted in solid, water-insoluble AgCl, filtered out
from the reaction. Water content was also estimated using the 1H NMR spectra (through integration of the water peak in DMSO-d6 located at 3.33 ppm) and was found to be below
1%, except for the highly hydrophilic [Cho][Acy], which was observed
to contain 3% water as isolated.

While the formation of all
compounds and their 1:1 stoichiometry
was proven using NMR (1H and 13C NMR) spectroscopy,
ionization was assessed using FT-IR spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra were
recorded for the neat compounds 1–6, and compared
with the FT-IR spectra of free acyclovir hydrate (3Acy·2H2O) and fully ionized sodium acyclovirate (Figures S2 and S3 in the Supporting Information
(SI)). The main region of difference among the compounds was from
1600 to 1200 cm–1. Characterization by FT-IR spectroscopy
(Figures S2 and S3) revealed that upon
deprotonation, the peak of the carbonyl in the six-membered ring of
neutral acyclovir (C–NH–C(O)–C)
shifted from ca. 1600 to 1560 cm–1 and greatly increased
in intensity; both the value and intensity are similar to that of
Na[Acy] (1575 cm–1). This is the most indicative
peak related to ionization of HAcy, and the shift can be explained
by the weakening of the C=O bond due to deprotonation of the
adjacent NH group and the appearance of the corresponding resonance
structure ((C–N––C(O)–C) <−> C–N=C(O–)–C).

Thermal Characterization
The prepared
compounds were
characterized through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to establish
the decomposition temperatures, and differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) to determine their melting points (Tm) and/or phase transitions (glass, Tg, or solid–solid, Ts-s)
(see SI). All of the synthesized compounds
showed similar or lower thermal stabilities than that of the neutral,
crystalline acyclovir hydrate (T5% of
240 °C, see Table 1). The highest thermal stability was obtained for [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, where the T5% of
ca. 243 °C was at least 100 °C higher than those of the
ILs [Cho][Acy] 1, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4. Both the [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4 ILs had a similar thermal stability, although a slightly
higher T5% was observed for the symmetric
[N4,4,4,4]+ cation in 3 (ca. 130
°C) than that for the asymmetric, long-chain [N1,1,1,16]+ cation in 4 (ca. 120 °C); these values
are in agreement with reported data: stability decreases with increasing
length of the alkyl groups for ammonium or phosphonium ions.40 [Cho][Acy] 1 also showed low thermal
stability (T5% = 131 °C). The chloride
salt [H2Acy]Cl 5 underwent the same two-step
decomposition observed for acyclovir, although at a much lower temperature
(T5% 156 °C).

Although
five of the six prepared salts could be classified as
ILs by the common literature definition of melting below 100 °C,
we only met our target for the API–ILs of being liquid below
average body temperature42 for [Cho][Acy] 1 and [H2Acy][Doc] 6 (see Table 1). The four salts
obtained with the acyclovir anion were amorphous ([Cho][Acy] 1) or had much lower melting points ([P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4) compared to that of acyclovir. All but [Cho][Acy] 1 (which showed only a glass transition, Tg = −50.2 °C) and [H2Acy][Doc] 6 (which showed no transitions in the investigated temperature
range) exhibited different transitions in the first and consecutive
cycles of the DSC curve.

Thus, [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2 melts through a
transition with multiple peaks, a major one at 95.1 °C and a
smaller one at 100.4 °C, both on the first heating. It was suggested
that [Acy]− converts to HAcy with the change in
ratio of [P4,4,4,4]+ and Acy from 1:1 to 1:2,
indicating disproportionation of the [P4,4,4,4][Acy] IL
to [P4,4,4,4][Acy]·HAcy and at least one other unidentified
crystalline phase, and this is discussed in detail below, in the Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction section. After
the first melting occurred, the compound exhibited only a glass transition
at Tg = −35.4 °C during the
two consecutive DSC cycles.

Similarly, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 showed three
separate transitions on first heating, at 59.5, 70.4, and 76.6 °C,
respectively, which can also be explained as the melting of multiple
coinciding solid phases followed by crystallization of only a single
solid form that shows only one melting event at 65.4 °C. Accordingly,
[N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4 had a sharp melting peak
at Tm = 48.3 °C and a few transitions
(55.8, 84.1 °C) on first heating observed after the melting event,
which could indicate multiple solid forms melting on the first cycle.
On subsequent cooling the compound appeared to solidify into a different
form (Tg = −22.92 °C), which
undergoes overlapping exothermic and endothermic transitions on warming,
immediately followed by melting.

Acyclovir hydrochloride, [H2Acy]Cl 5 (acyclovir
cation Cl– intermediate), was obtained as a high
melting crystalline material with a Tm of >290 °C (the limit of our Fisher–Johns melting
point
apparatus), and as mentioned above, there was no melting or other
transition observed for the docusate IL, [H2Acy][Doc] 6.

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Further insight into
the nature of the complicated thermal behavior of the salts of [Acy]− was obtained from [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2 which, although initially isolated as a waxy solid, eventually
gave large crystals on storing. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction on
one of these crystals identified it as [P4,4,4,4][Acy]·HAcy,
which crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21/c with one [P4,4,4,4]+ cation, one neutral HAcy molecule, and one deprotonated [Acy]− anion in the asymmetric unit (Z = 4, Figure 2, top). The acidic N–H
atom of the neutral acyclovir molecule is positioned on the ring nitrogen
atom α to the carbonyl group (N3), which is the same as in the
tautomer of guanine found in nucleic acids,43 and it makes a hydrogen bond with the equivalent position on the
[Acy]− anion (N3–H···N9).
The [P4,4,4,4]+ cation has three transoid butyl
chains and one chain that is all transoid except for the terminal
methyl group (C8), which is in a gauche conformation. It can be seen
from the crystal structure that, once deprotonated, [Acy]− actually has the right geometry to engage in complementary Watson–Crick-type
base pairing with HAcy, similar to that observed in co-crystals of
HAcy with 5-fluorouracil,44 and the resulting
complex behaves in some ways as a single ion (Figure 2, bottom).

Figure 2 Fifty percent probability ellipsoid plot
of asymmetric unit of
[P4,4,4,4][Acy]·HAcy (top) and the [H(Acy)2]− anion (bottom).

The CSD45 contains no examples
of a
free acyclovir anion. The bond distances of the two acyclovir moieties
in [P4,4,4,4][Acy]·HAcy show that, upon going from
neutral HAcy to the anion, the N–C single bonds become significantly
shorter and the C=N and C=O double bonds become longer.
This is consistent with the anion being a hybrid of three resonance
forms where the negative charge resides at N8, N9, or O6. The C26–N10
single bond in the anion is significantly longer than that in the
neutral molecule, likely because the presence of a partial negative
charge on N9 forces the lone pair on N10 to be more localized, making
it more like an amine and less like an amidine. In the neutral HAcy
molecule, the C18–N3 and C18–N5 bonds are longer than
those reported in the crystal structures of pure HAcy44 or HAcy·2/3H2O.46 This may be the result of some transfer of the negative charge on
[Acy]− to HAcy through the hydrogen affecting these
bonds, respectively, by decreasing the polarity of the C18–N3
bond and reducing the delocalization of the lone pair on N5. The differences
in bond distances of [Acy]− and HAcy are comparable
in magnitude to the bond distance differences between certain bonds
in the three crystallographically unique HAcy molecules of 3Acy·2H2O (see SI).

Furthermore, [P4,4,4,4]+ forms short contacts
with three anions and one neutral HAcy molecule (Figure 3). Two of these anions and
the HAcy molecule sandwich the cation by stacking above and below
it, whereas the third anion forms short contacts with one of the butyl
groups through the C–H groups on its ether side chain. The
anion makes short contacts with three cations, four anions, and two
neutral molecules of acyclovir. The anion donates and receives hydrogen
bonds between the −OH group of the side chain and the free
nitrogen position on the imidazole ring, which are the shortest hydrogen
bonds in the structure. The other two anions interact by either donating
or receiving a hydrogen bond from the imidazole C–H group to
the alcohol −OH group. Atoms O6, N9, and N10 are all involved
in hydrogen bonding with a single complementary HAcy neighbor.

Figure 3 Short (less
than the sum of the van der Waals radii) contact environments
around the cation (top left), anion (top right), and neutral HAcy
molecule (bottom).

The other neighboring
HAcy molecule interacts by donating and receiving
hydrogen bonds between the amino group and nonprotonated ring nitrogen
atoms, forming a symmetric eight-membered hydrogen bonded cycle. The
HAcy molecule makes short contacts with one cation and two anions
through the aforementioned interactions as well as with five other
HAcy molecules. Two neighboring HAcy molecules interact to form a
chain through hydrogen bonds between the −OH groups and carbonyl
oxygen atoms. One neighbor engages in a dimeric interaction where
the imidazole C–H group is donated in a weak hydrogen bond
to the imidazole N atom. The remaining two HAcy molecules either donate
or receive weak hydrogen bonds between C–H groups and the −OH
group oxygen atom.

The complementary hydrogen bonding between
HAcy and [Acy]− is similar to that seen in the cocrystal
of HAcy and 5-fluoruracil,47 but because
the amino groups involved in these
hydrogen bonds are pyramidal, the resulting H-bonded complex is V-shaped
rather than flat (Figure 4). These individual complexes are linked along c into infinite ribbons through anion–anion O–H···N
hydrogen bonds and through the cyclic hydrogen bonding between the
amino and pyrimidine ring nitrogen atoms of HAcy and [Acy]−. The adjacent H-bonded complexes in these ribbons are oriented with
the vertex of the V-shape pointed in opposite directions.

Figure 4 Packing diagrams.
(Top) Hydrogen bonded ribbon with cations. (Bottom)
2 × 2 × 2 unit cell packing diagram viewed down. Green lines
indicate short contacts.

Cations reside in the cleft of the V and appear to interact
with
both HAcy and [Acy]−, so although the structures
of the molecules indicate localization of the charge to one ion, they
act together as an oligomeric ion in the lattice. The weaker hydrogen
bonds involving the imidazole rings and the alcohol side chains connect
the ribbons along ±a to form anionic zigzag
layers, and the cations reside above and below these layers along b and bridge them to complete the 3-D network. The alternating
stacking of cations over anions and the layer network can be observed
when viewed down the c axis.

Although small
amounts of adventitious water could provide the
protons to convert [Acy]− to HAcy without being
easily detected by spectroscopy, the change in ratio of [P4,4,4,4]+ and Acy from 1:1 to 1:2 indicated that the IL itself
must be undergoing disproportionation. This was further confirmed
by optical polarizing microscope photographs (see SI), which showed the presence of both crystalline and liquid
phases, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), which confirmed the presence
of [P4,4,4,4][Acy]·HAcy as well as at least one other
unidentified crystalline phase (see SI).
This disproportionation is likely stabilized by the complementarity
of the interaction between [Acy]− and HAcy. On the
one hand, such dimers are likely to form in the other [Acy]− salts and may play a role in preventing their crystallization, as
has been seen in cases where pharmaceutical salts were deliberately
combined with excess acid or base.48 On
the other hand, this structure demonstrated that, like the challenge
of “disappearing polymorphism” in solids,47 ILs are capable of crystallizing over time through
unforeseen mechanisms that change their composition. The unpredictability
of long-term stability is a major problem for solid APIs yet is often
overlooked in the design of ILs for pharmaceutical applications, although
we previously noted it in the irreversible hydration of the IL procaine
acetate to give its crystalline hydrate.49

Solubilities
The determination of the aqueous solubilities
of acyclovir, [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4, and [H2Acy]Cl 5 in deionized (DI) H2O was conducted via the “shake-flask method”50 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
An equilibrium solubility (the concentration of acyclovir compounds
in a saturated aqueous solution in the presence of undissolved solid)
was determined by placing an excess of solid into DI H2O followed by stirring for 24 h, to establish equilibrium before
separating the saturated solution from the precipitate by filtration
through a 0.2 μm Teflon syringe. The filtrate was then analyzed
using either ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy
and previously prepared calibration curves ([P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4, and [H2Acy]Cl 5) or quantitative NMR ([N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3), see Methods section.

The solubility
of [Cho][Acy] (1, wax) in DI H2O was also
determined; however, the procedure was modified for this sample because
it absorbs small amounts of water to become an oil. After an excess
of [Cho][Acy] 1 was placed into DI water, the mixture
was centrifuged for 150 min, and allowed to equilibrate until phase
separation between the oil of [Cho][Acy] 1 (lower layer)
and the saturated aqueous solution (upper layer) was achieved (15
days). After phase separation, a small amount of aqueous upper layer
was removed and analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy.51 (Please note that care must be taken to prevent
any of the bottom layer (the oil) from contaminating the top layer.)

For the study of the solubility of waxy [H2Acy][Doc] 6, DI H2O was added first (ca. 0.3 mL) and an emulsion
was formed. More water was then added in small increments (2–4
drops) while the emulsion was sonicated for ∼30 min after each
water addition. This dilution procedure was repeated multiple times
until all of [H2Acy][Doc] 6 had dissolved
and a clear solution was obtained. The solution was then subjected
to UV–vis spectroscopy to determine the concentration of [H2Acy][Doc] 6 using the corresponding calibration
curve.

All six compounds showed orders of magnitude higher solubility
in DI water (pH = 6.92) than that of neutral acyclovir (1.57 mg acyclovir
active/mL, Table 2, Figure 5) and all [Cation][Acyclovir] 1–4 compounds showed higher solubilities
than the published value for acyclovir sodium, the commercial form
of acyclovir (90.68 mg acyclovir active/mL, Table 2, Figure 5). As expected, the highest water solubility was observed
for [Cho][Acy] 1, with a maximum solubility of 600(10)
mg acyclovir active/mL, which is almost 400 times higher than that
of acyclovir and 6 times higher than that of the acyclovir sodium
salt. Our results are in agreement with the data reported in the literature;
there are numerous examples of choline salts of marketed drugs that
have higher solubility compared to that of the neutral form (e.g.,
choline naproxen is 6700 times more water soluble and choline tolmetin
is 8000 times more water soluble than their corresponding free bases52).

Improvements in acyclovir solubility were also observed
even when
more hydrophobic cations were used; for example the solubility of
[P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2 (372.7 mg acyclovir active/mL)
was ca. 200 times higher than that of acyclovir. The solubilities
of the ammonium salts ([N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3,
213.7 mg acyclovir active/mL and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4, 101.3 mg acyclovir active/mL) were somewhat lower compared
to those of either [Cho][Acy] 1 or [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, yet 60–100 times higher than that of
acyclovir. The relative solubilities of [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4 appear to be directly related to the aqueous
solubilities of the phosphonium and ammonium ions.

The salts
of the acyclovir cation were also more soluble than neutral
acyclovir, but to a much smaller degree (54.3 mg acyclovir active/mL
for [H2Acy]Cl 5 and 2.9 mg acyclovir active/mL
for [H2Acy][Doc] 6). When compared to the
sodium salt, chloride [H2Acy]Cl 5 was comparable
in solubility to Na[Acy], and [H2Acy][Doc] 6 was less soluble than the sodium salt. We would like to note here
that although [H2Acy][Doc] 6 had the lowest
water solubility observed for any of the salts prepared here, it could
still deliver more than twice the concentration of acyclovir to solution
than that from the neutral form of this API. We should also note that
our original strategy of using the docusate anion was to reduce the
water solubility to enhance transdermal transport, and generally,
high hydrophobicity is observed for docusate salts.27

The solubilities of [Cho][Acy] 1, [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3, and [H2Acy]Cl 5 were
also investigated in different physiologically relevant aqueous environments:
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4, commercially available),
simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH = 6.8, prepared according to United
States Pharmacopeia (USP) 2653,54), and simulated gastric
fluid (SGF, pH = 1.2, prepared according to USP 30).54 As acyclovir reacts with stoichiometric amounts of HCl
to form [H2Acy]Cl 5, the solubility of neutral
acyclovir was studied only in PBS and SIF. For these tests, [Cho][Acy] 1 was chosen as its aqueous solubility was the highest of
all of the acyclovir compounds. Compound [H2Acy]Cl 5 was chosen to test the cationic
form of acyclovir given the difficulty in the study of [H2Acy][Doc] 6. Out of the three similarly behaving ammonium
and phosphonium cationic acyclovir compounds, 3 was chosen
to represent them.

Solubility studies in the buffers were conducted
as noted above,
however, the method used to determine the solubility of [Cho][Acy] 1 again had to be slightly modified. When it was mixed with
each buffer, no clear phase separation was observed in any of the
fluids (i.e., no evidence of precipitation was noted). After the solutions
stood for 7 days at room temperature, phase separation was noted,
where the top layer was a buffer solution of [Cho][Acy] 1 and the bottom layer was neat [Cho][Acy] (confirmed by 1H NMR). The top phase was removed, filtered, and analyzed using UV–vis
spectroscopy.

All of the salts studied demonstrated much higher
solubility compared
to that of neutral acyclovir in all three physiological media, with
similar trends ([Cho][Acy] 1 > [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 > [H2Acy]Cl 5) to
the aqueous solubility
data discussed above. The solubilities of [Cho][Acy] 1 were again the highest and similar in the fluids with similar pH
(H2O, PBS, and SIF, respectively). In PBS, [Cho][Acy] 1 showed a solubility enhancement of ca. 450 times that of
neutral acyclovir (657.0 mg acyclovir active/mL for [Cho][Acy] 1 vs 1.421 mg acyclovir active/mL for acyclovir, Table 2). In SIF, [Cho][Acy] 1 was ca. 650 times more soluble than neutral acyclovir (649.1
mg acyclovir active/mL, Table 2). An even higher solubility for [Cho][Acy] 1 was observed for the lower pH buffer (861.8 mg acyclovir active/mL, Table 2). Salt [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 delivered ca. 150 times more acyclovir active
than that of acyclovir itself in all three media used. Acyclovir in
its anionic form was more buffer-soluble than acyclovir in its cationic
form independent of the media chosen; however, even compound [H2Acy]Cl 5 delivered ca. 40–80 times more
acyclovir than the neutral API itself, depending on the medium.

Conclusions
Because poorly soluble drugs such as acyclovir
are known to be
absorbed more slowly than more soluble APIs, current research has
focused on finding methods to increase the solubility of these drugs.
Here, we have shown how one can take advantage of the amphoteric character
of acyclovir and form the corresponding ILs or salts of the acyclovir
cation or anion to achieve improved solubility over acyclovir or acyclovir
sodium in water. The solubility of two of the ILs and the hydrochloride
salt in simulated body fluids also showed great improvement when compared
to that of the neutral acyclovir. It was found that acyclovir in its
anionic form (i.e., [Cat][Acy]) was more water- or buffer-soluble
than acyclovir in its cationic form ([H2Acy][Anion]) although
this might be the effect of these particular ions. Overall, the data
suggest not only that solubility enhancements can be achieved, but
that the solubilities can be finely tuned over a wide range of solubilities
by proper choice of the cationic or anionic form of acyclovir and
the counterion paired with it.

Methods
Chemicals
Acyclovir
was purchased from TCI America
(Portland, OR), and was determined to be a hydrate according to its
PXRD pattern, described below (3Acy·2H2O, 95% acyclovir
active). Choline hydroxide (46 wt % solution in water) was purchased
from Aldrich Chemical Company (Dorset, U.K. and Saint Louis, MO).
Tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (40 wt % in water) and tetrabutylammonium
hydroxide (40 wt % in water) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Ward
Hill, MA). The exact concentration of ammonium and phosphonium hydroxide
solution was determined prior to use via titration. DI H2O used in the solubility experiments, in the preparation of buffers,
and in determining the calibration curves was obtained with a specific
resistivity of 17.38 MΩ cm from a commercial deionizer (Culligan
Water Systems, Chattanooga, TN). Celite, anhydrous ethanol, and methanol
were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company (Saint Louis, MO). Monobasic
potassium phosphate (KH2PO4), sodium chloride
(NaCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and hydrochloric acid (Hydrochloric
Acid, Certified ACS Plus, Fisher Chemical) were obtained from Fisher
Scientific (Hampton, NH). PBS tablets were obtained from Aldrich Chemical
Company (Saint Louis, MO). All chemicals were used as received without
any further purification unless otherwise noted.

Preparation of Buffers
PBS (pH = 7.4) was prepared
from the commercially available tablets by dissolving 1 tablet in
200 mL of DI H2O. SIF (pH = 6.8, no pancreatic enzyme added)
was prepared following the USP guidelines53 where, in a volumetric flask, 0.6805 g of KH2PO4 and 0.0896 g of NaOH were dissolved and diluted with DI H2O to 100 mL. SGF (pH = 1.2, no pepsin enzyme added) was prepared
following USP guidelines,53 where, in a
volumetric flask, 0.200 g of NaCl and 0.7 mL of concentrated HCl (to
adjust to pH = 1.2) were dissolved and diluted with DI H2O to 100 mL.

Characterization
NMR Spectroscopy
NMR data were recorded in DMSO-d6 at
25 °C on a Bruker (Coventry, U.K.)
300 DRX spectrometer and the solvent peak was used as the reference,
and on a Bruker (Madison, WI) spectrometer 500 MHz Bruker Avance Spectrometer
Bruker/Magnex UltraShield 500 MHz magnet (operating at 500 MHz for 1H, 125 MHz for 13C, and 202.5 MHz for 31P spectra, respectively).

FT-IR Spectroscopy
FT-IR data were
recorded using a
Bruker α FT-IR instrument, Bruker Optics Inc. (Billerica, MA)
featuring an attenuated total reflection sampler equipped with a diamond
crystal. Spectra were obtained in the range of 600–4000 cm–1.

UV–Vis Spectra
UV–vis
spectra were recorded
on a Perkin Elmer Lambda XLS UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (Waltham,
MA).

TGA
TGA was performed on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/DSC 1
(Columbus, OH) under a flow of nitrogen. The instrument’s internal
temperature was calibrated by observing the melting point of Au, Zn,
and In standards (Tm 1064, 419.5, and
155.6, respectively). Samples (5–20 mg) were analyzed in 70
μL platinum pans and were heated from 25 to 800 °C and
measured in the dynamic heating regime, using a constant heating ramp
of 5 °C/min with a 30 min isotherm at 75 °C. Decomposition
temperatures are reported as the 5% onset (T5%onset).

PXRD
Data were collected on a Bruker
(Madison, WI)
D2 Phaser powder X-ray diffractometer and Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer
with a Lynxeye linear position-sensitive detector (Bruker-AXS). A
spatula-tip full of material was taken from the sample vial and ground
by hand in an agate mortar and pestle. The resulting soft, tacky solid
was smeared onto a silicon wafer cut to an off-Bragg plane. PXRD was
recorded in Bragg–Brentano geometry using Ni-filtered Cu Kα
radiation. The sample was rotated at 15 rpm during data collection.
Data were collected using 1 s/0.02° steps and a 2θ range
of 5–40 or 10–35°.

DSC Analyses
Thermal
transitions for the compounds
were measured on a TA Instrument-2000 DSC unit (New Castle, DE) under
a stream of nitrogen. The sample (2–4 mg) was placed into T
Zero pans (Part # 901683.901), covered with hermetic aluminum lids
(Part # 900794.901), sealed using a press (T Zero Sample Press), and
heated at a heating rate of 5 °C/min, followed by a 5 min
isotherm, then cooled at a rate of 5 °C/min to −60 °C,
again followed by a final 5 min isotherm at −60 °C.

(Acyclovir itself was taken from 25 to 300 °C, and docusate 6 from −60 to 150 °C, at the same rate with isotherms
at the lowest and highest temperature.) The cycle was repeated twice
to ensure consistency of the observed thermal transitions. The protocol
used in the case of solid samples was as follows: (a) ramp up to the
target temperature (Ttarget) at 5 °C/min;
(b) isotherm for 5 min to ensure equilibration of the temperature
in the cell; (c) ramp down at 5 °C/min to about −60 °C;
(d) isotherm for 5 min to ensure equilibration of the temperature
in the cell; (e) repeat steps (a)–(d) twice (i.e., the entire
cycle was repeated three times).

Single-Crystal X-ray Diffraction
Data (SCXRD)
SCXRD
was collected on a Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with a Photon
100 CMOS detector using Mo Kα radiation from an IμS microfocus
source (Bruker-AXS, Madison, WI). A crystalline prism measuring 0.82
× 0.15 × 0.15 mm3 was mounted in a Kapton loop
using heavy hydrocarbon oil (MiTeGen, Ithaca, NY) and cooled to 100
K under a cold stream of nitrogen using an Oxford N-Helix cryostat
(Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, U.K.). A hemisphere of unique data was
collected through strategies of scans about the phi and omega axes.
The Apex3 software suite was used for data collection, unit cell determination,
data reduction, integration, and scaling.55

The crystal structure was solved by intrinsic phasing and
refined by full-matrix least squares refinement against F2. Nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms
bonded to N or O were located from the difference map, their coordinates
were refined freely, and their thermal parameters constrained to ride
on the carrier atoms. Hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon were placed
in calculated positions and constrained to ride on the carrier atoms.
Methyl groups were refined using a riding–rotating model. Structure
solution and refinement were done using the Bruker SHELXTL software
suite56 and SHELXL-2014.57

Acyclovir powder was suspended in
anhydrous ethanol and an equimolar (with respect to pure acyclovir,
i.e., 0.95 mol/mol with respect to hydrate) amount of ammonium or
phosphonium hydroxide (aqueous or methanolic, respectively) was added
dropwise using a glass Hamilton syringe. The suspension was stirred
using a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer for 15 min at room temperature,
until a clear solution was obtained. After that, the solvent was evaporated
using a Buchi rotary evaporator and the remaining volatile materials
were removed further under high vacuum (0.01 mbar, 50 °C) to
yield the desired compound.

Solubility
Construction of Calibration Curves
Calibration curves
in DI H2O and buffers were obtained by analyzing five times
each, five to eight different solutions of known concentrations (0–5
× 10–4 M) of the corresponding acyclovir compound.
Aqueous (or corresponding buffer) stock solutions were first prepared
by mass, and then several standard dilutions were made to obtain a
series of known concentrations. The absorbance at 254 nm was selected
for analysis and the plots of concentration against absorbance at
254 nm were fit to a straight line passing through the origin (correlation
coefficients of R2 ≥ 0.99 were
obtained). The resultant concentration was back calculated from the
obtained data against the calibration curve to calculate the solubility
values.

Determination of Solubility Based on Phase Separation for [Cho][Acy] 1
Solubility of [Cho][Acy] (1) in DI water was determined
as follows. In a 20 mL screw top vial, 5.500 g of [Cho][Acy] 1 was mixed with 2 mL of DI H2O. The mixture was
stirred for 24 h at room temperature resulting in the formation of
a very viscous solution. The solution was centrifuged for 150 min
at 2500 rpm to facilitate phase separation, but no phase separation
was initially observed. The mixture was allowed to stand for 15 days
when a thin layer of a more viscous mixture (excess of [Cho][Acy] 1 according to NMR analysis) was phase-separated from the
solution, at the bottom of the vial (see Figure S1).

Then, 0.5 mL of the top phase (aqueous solution
of solution [Cho][Acy] 1) was taken out from the top
phase, filtered (Teflon syringe filter membranes, 0.2 μm pore
size), and a 0.1 mL aliquot was withdrawn. The withdrawn aliquot was
diluted to 100 mL with DI H2O using a volumetric flask
and the absorbance at 254 nm was measured via UV–vis spectroscopy.
The obtained absorbance value was too large and outside of the spectrometer
range. Therefore, the solution was further diluted as follows: 0.25
mL of this solution was transferred into a 25 mL volumetric flask
and DI water was added up to the mark. The absorbance at 254 nm of
the obtained solution was measured and the concentration determined
using a predetermined calibration curve of the compound in water.
Solubility values were recalculated taking into the account the multiple
dilutions described above. The experiment was done in duplicate.

Determination of Solubility for Acyclovir, [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4, and [Acy]Cl 5 via the Flask-Shake Method
The solubility of acyclovir
in both DI water and PBS, solubility
of [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2 and [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4 in DI water, and solubility of [Acy]Cl 5 in both DI water and all three physiological fluids (PBS,
SGF, or SIF) were determined as follows. In a screw top vial, the
crystalline powder (acyclovir, [P4,4,4,4][Acy] 2, [N1,1,1,16][Acy] 4, and [Acy]Cl 5) was suspended in DI H2O and stirred overnight at room
temperature. Equilibrium between the solid–liquid phases was
reached by the end of 12 h, leaving some remaining solid undissolved.
The remaining solid was removed by filtration (Teflon syringe filter
membranes, 0.2 μm pore size) and the filtrate was analyzed using
UV–vis spectroscopy, against a predetermined calibration curve.

Determination of Solubility of [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 via Flask-Shake Method Followed by Quantitative 1H NMR
The solubilities of [N4,4,4,4][Acy] 3 in
DI water and all three physiological fluids (PBS, SGF,
or SIF) were determined as follows. 0.1 g of the compound was placed
into 0.5 mL of DI water, and the solution was stirred at room temperature
for 24 h. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 0.2 μm
Teflon syringe filter to obtain a clear solution, and 0.1 mL of this
solution was combined with 0.4 mL of DMSO-d6 0.05% (v/v) TMS (corresponding to 1.836 × 10–6 mol TMS). 1H NMR spectra were recorded and the final
solubility was determined using integration, that is, the molar ratio
between the peaks corresponding to the compound and TMS was determined,
followed by calculation of the molar amount of the dissolved compound.

Determination of Solubility via the Flask-Shake Method for [H2Acy][Doc] 6
The solubility of [H2Acy][Doc] 6 in DI water was determined as follows.
In a screw top vial, 0.2 g of [Acy][Doc] was suspended in 1.5 mL of
DI H2O. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room temperature
resulting in the formation of a stable emulsion (stable for at least
48 h at room temperature). To about 0.3 mL of this emulsion, water
was added dropwise, two to four drops at a time (with vigorous mixing
each time after water was added), and the mixture was sonicated for
about 30 min. This process (addition of water, mixing, sonication)
was repeated until a clear solution was obtained. The solution was
analyzed through UV–vis spectroscopy, against a predetermined
calibration curve.
