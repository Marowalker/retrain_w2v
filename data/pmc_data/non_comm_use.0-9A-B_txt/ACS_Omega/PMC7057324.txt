A crucial step in accurate targeted
protein quantification using
targeted proteomics is to determine optimal proteotypic peptides representing
targeted proteins. In this study, a workflow of peptide selection
to determine proteotypic peptides using a dimethylation high-resolution
mass spectrum strategy with a peptide release kinetic model was investigated
and applied in peptide selection of bovine serum albumin. After specificity,
digestibility, recovery, and stability evaluation of tryptic peptides
in bovine serum albumin, the optimal proteotypic peptide was selected
as LVNELTEFAK. The quantification method using LVNELTEFAK gave a linear
range of 1–100 ppm with the coefficient greater than 0.9990,
and the detection limit of bovine serum albumin in milk was 0.78 mg/kg.
Compared with the proteotypic peptides selected by Skyline, the method
showed a better performance in method validation. The workflow exhibited
high comprehensiveness and efficiency in peptide selection, facilitating
accurate targeted protein quantification in the food matrix, which
lack protein standards.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Accurate
quantification of individual protein, or a group of proteins,
is crucial for studies of biochemical systems, such as food and food
consumer as well as for the quality and safety control of food. Moreover,
modeling studies necessary for understanding the complex interplay
of the system (food or consumer) components or interplay between components
of two systems (food and consumer) require accurate absolute quantitative
information.1,2 Mass spectrometry-based quantitative
proteomics in combination with stable isotope-labeling is an advanced
technology leading a systematical and quantitative analysis of protein
profiles.3−5 For absolute quantitative analysis, the protein standard
absolute quantification (PSAQ) method has been developed using full-length
isotope-labeled proteins as internal standards.6,7 Considering
the high cost and complicated processing in synthesis of isotopic
protein standards, an absolute quantification (AQUA) method has been
developed using stable isotope-labeled peptides as internal standards.8,9 Targeted proteomics is quantitative proteomics based on the AQUA
method, in which the quantification of the target protein relies on
the optimal proteolytic peptides that have quantification characteristics
similar to the target protein.10,11 As a result, selection
of proteotypic peptides is a crucial step in targeted proteomics determining
the quantification accuracy of target proteins.12,13

In recent years, several strategies have been built for proteotypic
peptide selection in targeted proteomics.14,15 The enhanced signature peptide (ESP) predictor is a computational
method to predict high-responding peptides of target proteins without
experimental data and the high-responding peptides are regarded as
the optimal proteotypic peptides.16 PeptidePicker,
as a software package, provides a scientific workflow to process and
integrate the information from different online data sources for selecting
the optimal signature peptides of target proteins.17 Additionally, selection of optimal proteotypic peptides
that relies on experimental data has been developed using in vitro-synthesized
proteins and Skyline software.18,19 Most of these strategies
are based on the following major principles: peptides should (i) be
unique in the assay matrix, (ii) have a good response in the mass
spectrometer, and (iii) have a specific and stable fragmentation pattern.
It is worth mentioning that an incomplete proteolytic peptide release
could result in the inaccurate quantification of targeted protein.20 So proteolytic digestion is an important factor
affecting the accuracy of protein quantification, which should be
considered in the selection of optimal proteotypic peptides as well.

Sequencing grade modified trypsin is an important digestion enzyme
of targeted proteomics that specifically cleaves peptide chains at
the carboxyl side of lysine or arginine, unless either is followed
by proline.21 Ideally, the specificity
of trypsin guarantees that 1 M targeted protein is able to be hydrolyzed
into equimolar characteristic peptides to accurately quantify the
target protein. But it has been demonstrated that the cleavage sites
surrounded by neutral residues could be quickly cut while those with
neighboring charged residues or proline residue could be slowly cut.22 This means that not all tryptic cleavage sites
could be completely hydrolyzed and not all peptides could be completely
released from target protein in the actual application of trypsin.
In recent researches, kinetic parameters of sequencing grade modified
trypsin have been modified and reported according to the Michaelis–Menten
equation.21 However, the protein degradation
kinetics could not represent the release kinetics of proteolytic peptides
and different peptides have different release kinetic parameters under
the specific digestion condition.23,24

In this
article, a kinetic equation of peptide release was developed,
which is able to describe the peptide release kinetics during tryptic
digestion and evaluate the release ratio of fully tryptic peptides
for proteotypic peptide selection. On the basis of the peptide release
kinetic model, a comprehensive workflow of peptide selection for accurate
targeted protein quantification was developed using a dimethylation
high-resolution mass spectrum strategy, considering the specificity,
digestibility, recovery, and stability of tryptic peptides. To simplify
the description, we used bovine serum albumin (BSA) in raw bovine
milk as an example. One part of the strategy was establishment of
the peptide quantification method, which is based on high-resolution
mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Quadrupole-Orbitrap) as well as dimethylation
labeling and proteomics database (Uniprot, http://www.uniprot.org/). The
other part was peptide selection via specificity, digestibility, recovery,
and stability of peptides. Finally, method validation of proteotypic
peptides for quantification of bovine serum albumin was performed
and compared to that determined by Skyline.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Peptide Screening and Quantification
Fully tryptic peptides of BSA (UniprotKB #P02769) were screened
using
targeted proteomics following the schematic shown in Figure 1A. The first step is tryptic
digestion, during which the primary sequence of target protein was
hydrolyzed into specific peptides with the lysine or arginine at the
C-terminal. Next, to produce the isotopic interior label of all specific
peptides, dimethylation was reacted on the free amino of both lysine
residue and N-terminal of specific peptides.25 Because every tryptic peptide has a free amino in the N-terminal,
all of them have no less than one marked site, guaranteeing the application
of dimethylation labeling in peptide selection. Dimethylation labeling
in this method has two levels (Figure 1C): the light label with a mass increase of 28.031
Da using formaldehyde and the heavy label with a mass increase of
34.063 Da using isotopic formaldehyde. After trypsin digestion and
dimethylation labeling, the peptide solution of BSA with the light
label and the heavy label was, respectively, analyzed by a UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap
mass spectrometer with full MS/dd-MS2 (TopN) mode.

Figure 1 Schematic overview
of the dimethylation high-resolution mass spectrum
strategy. (A) A schematic of peptide screening and quantification
method included tryptic digestion, dimethylation, and high-resolution
mass spectrum acquisition. High-resolution mass spectrum analysis
was performed on UHPLC-quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry with
the full MS/dd-MS2 (TopN) mode, which was able to acquire major parent
ions and the related daughter ions. (B) Reaction pathway of dimethylation.
Dimethylation was the combination of a nucleophilic addition reaction
on formaldehyde and an imine reduction reaction using sodium cyanoborohydride.
(C) Two levels of dimethylation labeling. The light label was reacted
with formaldehyde, and the heavy label was reacted with isotopic formaldehyde.

The raw files were further processed by Proteome
Discoverer 2.1
(Thermo) with the Sequest algorithm. The advanced parameters of the
Sequest algorithm were set at precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm,
fragment mass tolerance of 0.02 Da, the static modifications of carbamidomethyl
and dimethylation, and the dynamic modifications of acetyl and oxidation.
However, not all fully tryptic peptides could be determined by Proteome
Discoverer 2.1. Combining with the Xcalibur (Thermo), all fully tryptic
peptides with 5–21 amino acids except for peptides VLASSAR
and DAIPENLPPLTADFAEDK were identified considering the modifications
of carbamidomethyl, dimethylation, and oxidation. Accurate mass of
all of these peptides was determined using a high-resolution mass
spectrum and is shown in Table S1.

Quantification of tryptic peptides with a light label in samples
relied on the light-to-heavy ratio in which the heavy isotopic label
was the heavy-labeled homologous peptides from the BSA standard. After
the isometric mixing of the sample peptide solution with the light
label and standard peptide solution with the heavy label, the mixture
was analyzed using a quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer in full
MS mode. The identification information of all 49 detected peptides
is shown in Table S1, including precursor
charge, modifications, retention time, and response value. According
to the quantification results of different peptides, different peptides
have significantly different quantification values of BSA in raw bovine
milk (shown in Figure S2). It was an issue that which
peptide was the proteotypic peptide undertaking the accurate quantification
of targeted protein (Table 1).

2.2 Peptide Release Kinetics
According
to the experimental data of each peptide, fitting digestion curves
and corresponding residues of 46 tryptic peptides are shown in Figure S3. Among them, the release rate of 6
peptides such as YNGVFQECCQAEDK or ECCHGDLLECADDR was too slow so
their release kinetics curves were not applicable to eq 3. The calculation result of the
other 40 peptides converged after several iterations and residues
of all fitting points were no more than 20%, which showed a good fitting
degree in release kinetic curves using the peptide release kinetics
model. What’s more, the Michaelis constant (KM) and maximum reaction rate (vmax) of 40 peptides in BSA are shown in Table S2. A first-order kinetic equation had been reported to fit the kinetic
curve of peptide release.23 Compared with
the first-order kinetic equation, our kinetic model showed a better
fitting degree (Figure 2C). Additionally, this kinetic model could be used to predict the
peptide release content at a specific digestion time, especially the
ideal content at the end of the digestion, which could evaluate the
release ratio and digestion properties of each fully tryptic peptide
(as described in Section 3.5.2).

2.3 Peptide Selection
Peptide selection
bases on the peptide quantification method. For peptide selection,
we attempted to screen peptides via specificity, digestibility, recovery,
and stability to determine the proteotypic peptides, which should
(i) be unique in the assay matrix, (ii) be completely hydrolyzed in
tryptic digestion, (iii) be stable for the entire experiment, and
(iv) have a good recovery in peptide quantification.

The specificity
of tryptic peptides was evaluated by the hit number and alignment
score (Table 2). As
shown in Figure 2A,
the alignment score correlated well with peptide length (R = 0.9933), whereas the hit number was determined by the specificity
of peptide in the whole database, which had a negative correlation
with the peptide length (R = −0.4902). In
UniProtKB and Swiss-Prot database, 16 fully tryptic peptides of BSA
had no hits and they were marked as H grade, which were considered
as the unique peptides in the whole proteome. In addition, 26 fully
tryptic peptides of BSA had less than 10 hits, which were marked as
M grade. The most common hits reported were serum albumin in Ovis aries (sheep), Capra hircus (goat), Sus scrofa (pig), Equus caballus (horse), Homo sapiens (human), and so on. After the confirmation of absence of proteins
from other species, the peptides marked as M grade could be considered
as well. All of the tryptic peptides with five amino acids were marked
as L grade, which suggested that fully tryptic peptides with more
than five amino acids showed a better performance in specificity as
proteotypic peptides.

The
digestibility of tryptic peptides was determined using the
tryptic hydrolysis ratio, which was calculated from the fitting digestion
equation of each peptide. As shown in Figure 2B, the peptide ETYGDMADCCEK was not completely
hydrolyzed within 120 min and according to the fitting equation, 70%
of this peptide could be hydrolyzed from protein at the time point
of 120 min and it might be completely hydrolyzed after 48 h of digestion.
It is consented that the efficiency of trypsin rapidly reduces after
12 h, which indicates that ETYGDMADCCEK can never be completely hydrolyzed.
Peptides NYQEAK and LVNELTEFAK were the other two peptides that showed
good performance in tryptic digestion. According to their fitting
curves, NYQEAK could be completely hydrolyzed within 100 min, while
LVNELTEFAK, within 60 min. Tryptic hydrolysis ratios of all detected
peptides are shown in Table 2; 17 fully tryptic peptides were marked as H grade as their
tryptic hydrolysis ratios at the time point of 120 min were equal
to 100 ± 5%. It was considered that the molality of these peptides
could be similar to the real molality of target protein after proper
digestion.

The recovery rate (RR) of tryptic peptides was determined
using
a spiked BSA standard in dimethylation and raw milk matrix (Table 2). In dimethylation,
the light-to-heavy ratio of all detected peptides ranged from 84.28
to 106.07%, except for the peptides QEPER and LGEYGFQNALIVR. The differences
in the light-to-heavy ratio of different peptides may result from
different ionization rates between light and heavy-labeled peptides.
The RR of tryptic peptides in dimethylation that ranged from 90 to
105% had a similar ionization rate in light and heavy-labeled peptides.
In the raw milk matrix, the RR of some detected peptides could be
influenced by the matrix. For example, RR in the matrix of peptide
GLVLIAFSQYLQQCPFDEHVK was 523.13%, which had matrix interference in
the channel of the light label. As for AEFVEVTK, the RR in the matrix
was 34.18% and the matrix interference of this peptide was in the
channel of the heavy label. In general, 24 fully tryptic peptides
were marked as H grade as their recovery rate ranged from 90 to 105%
in both dimethylation and the matrix, which guaranteed that these
peptides could eliminate errors from dimethylation and assay matrix.

The stability of tryptic peptides was evaluated by relative standard
deviation (RSD) shown as reproducibility. In Table 2, the reproducibility of most peptides in
dimethylation and in raw milk matrix was good and less than 10%. Peptides
having poor reproducibility were considered to have a long length
or have matrix interference, such as GLVLIAFSQYLQQCPFDEHVK, having
a long length and CCAADDK having matrix interference in the channel
of the light label. In general, 26 fully tryptic peptides were marked
as H grade, for their reproducibility in dimethylation and the matrix
was both less than 5%.

According to the results shown in Table 2, peptide LVNELTEFAK
accomplished H grade
in specificity, digestibility, recovery, and stability. Therefore,
peptide LVNELTEFAK was chosen as proteotypic peptide of BSA in accurate
quantification. The peptides that accomplished H grade in digestibility,
recovery, and stabilit, but M grade in specificity could also be considered
if the assay matrix did not show interference from other species,
such as YLYEIAR, AWSVAR, HLVDEPQNLIK, and QTALVELLK.

2.4 Method Validation
The proteotypic
peptide LVNELTEFAK were used to quantify BSA in raw bovine milk. On
the basis of the proteotypic peptide, the concentration of bovine
serum albumin in tenfold-diluted raw bovine milk was 16.93 ±
0.80 mg/kg, similar to the BSA contents reported by Indyk et al.26 Method validation of proteotypic peptides in
BSA quantification was reported as follows.

The internal standard
method was used to quantify BSA using proteotypic peptides as markers.
Calibration curves were obtained by the relationship between the light-to-heavy
ratio and the concentration of the BSA standard in the range of 1–100
ppm, with 10 ppm heavy-labeled BSA standard as the internal standard.
The calibration curve with the linear regression equation and correlation
coefficient of proteotypic peptide is shown in Figure 3A. Good linearity of proteotypic peptides
(R2 > 0.9990) was achieved over concentration
levels ranging from 1 to 100 ppm. Standard curves of proteotypic peptides
selected by Skyline are shown in Figure S4.

(B) Quantification chromatography of peptide LVNELTEFAK with multiple
reaction monitoring mode (MRM). L quantitative channel was for samples,
while H quantitative channel was for the internal standards. (C) The
recovery rate of the additional standard. The recovery of the three
levels was 96.4% of 5 ppm, 104.8% of 20 ppm, and 104.1% of 50 ppm.
(D) Concentration of BSA quantified by different peptides. The concentration
of peptide LGEYGFQNALIVR showed a significant deviation. The concentration
of BSA using peptide AEFVEVTK was significantly lower than the concentration
using peptide LVNELTEFAK. No significant differences in the concentration
of BSA were quantified using peptide LVNELTEFAK, YLYEIAR, and QTALVELLK.
(E) Chromatography and spectrum of peptide in Skyline software. On
the basis of the quality of chromatography and spectrum, peptides
were divided into three groups using Skyline software.

The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ)
were
determined as the concentration of the BSA standard, where the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio of peptides reached 3:1 and 10:1, respectively. The spectrum
chromatograms of proteotypic peptide are shown in Figure 3B. LOD and LOQ of proteotypic
peptide shown in Table 3 were 0.78 and 2.59 mg/kg in raw bovine milk, respectively.

The standard addition method was
applied to determine the recovery
of proteotypic peptide. The raw bovine milk samples were spiked with
low, medium, and high standard levels (50, 200, and 500 ppm), which
were diluted 10-fold before analysis, and the concentration of the
internal standard was 10 ppm. As shown in Figure 3C, the recovery of proteotypic peptide was
96.4% in low, 104.9% in medium, and 104.1% in high spiked levels.
This result met the general requirements reported in ISO 5725.

The intraday and interday precision are expressed as relative standard
deviation. As shown in Table 3, the intraday precision of proteotypic peptide was no more
than 5% and the interday precision was no more than 10%, which met
the general requirements reported in ISO 5725.

2.5 Method
Comparison
The proteotypic
peptide confirmed by our strategy was compared with optimal proteotypic
peptides in Skyline. After the analysis of Skyline, peptides were
divided into three grades, which were green, yellow, and red.27 The peptides marked as green were regarded as
the proteotypic peptides. Combining with the PeptidePicker, the proteotypic
peptides of bovine serum albumin were YLYEIAR, AEFVEVTK, LGEYGFQNALIVR,
and QTALVELLK in Skyline. All proteotypic peptides in the two methods
are listed in Table 3, and the method validation was performed following the ISO 5725.
As shown in Figure 3D, concentration of peptide LGEYGFQNALIVR showed a significant deviation,
which showed a poor capacity of BSA quantification. Among other proteotypic
peptides, the concentration of BSA using peptide AEFVEVTK was significantly
lower than the concentration using other peptides. It was suggested
that the low contents resulted from the different recovery rates of
these peptides in the standard and samples. Additionally, the specificity
of peptides YLYEIAR and QTALVELLK was poor to meet the quantification
of target protein when there was interference from other species.
In general, the proteotypic peptide LVNELTEFAK had a better quantification
quality of BSA than those peptides confirmed by Skyline software.
Skyline is an effective software for peptide evaluation in targeted
proteomics, which considered the precursor response characteristics
and fragmentation-pattern quality of each peptide. While in our peptide
selection strategy, digestion and matrix interference were also considered
using dimethylation labeling and enzymolysis model. Therefore, our
strategy is an efficient and comprehensive workflow for peptide selection.

In conclusion, the accuracy of protein quantification using peptides
as biomarkers is affected by many factors, including peptide specificity,
peptide stability, tryptic digestion, and assay matrix. The peptide
release ratio was an important factor influencing the accuracy of
protein quantification. We have presented a dimethylation high-resolution
mass spectrum strategy with a peptide release kinetics model to determine
the tryptic digestion release ratio of proteolytic peptides. Combined
with specificity, stability, and recovery of fully tryptic peptides,
the current strategy can be applied to proteotypic peptide selection
for targeted proteins, including biomarkers, bioactive proteins, and
food allergens. In this study, proteotypic peptides of bovine serum
albumin were determined as LVNELTEFAK, which showed a better performance
in method validation than the proteotypic peptides determined by Skyline.
Considering the peptide release kinetics as well as mass spectrum
property and specificity, this strategy was an efficient and comprehensive
workflow for peptide selection in targeted proteomics. The quantification
of target proteins using the proteotypic peptides could have the similar
result with the protein standard, which facilitated accurate quantification
of target proteins in lack of protein standards. This workflow provides
a potential common method for marker peptide selection in different
food matrices. Different food matrices analyzed through this workflow
can obtain corresponding optimal markers for accurate quantification
of target proteins.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Reagents and Samples
BSA was used
as the standard for protein quantitation and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), dithiotheritol
(DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), ammonium hydroxide, sodium cyanoborohydride
(NaBH3CN), formaldehyde (CH2O), and formaldehyde-isotope
(13CD2O) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO) as well. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was from Worthington
Biochemical Corporation (Freehold, NJ). Formic acid and acetonitrile
of HPLC grade were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Ultrapure
water was obtained by a Milli-Q Gradient water purification system
(Millipore, Bedford, MA). Raw bovine milk samples were provided by
Shiyun Lai in Beingmate Research Institute.

3.2 Protein
Digestion
Fifty microliter
samples with a certain concentration were diluted using 900 μL
of 100 mM NaHCO3 solution, and the final concentration
of total protein was kept less than 200 μg/mL. The mixture was
reduced by adding 10 μL of 500 mM DTT in a metal bath at 70
°C for 30 min. Alkylation was performed with 30 μL of 500
mM IAA for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Subsequently, 10 μL
of trypsin (1 mg/mL, trypsin to protein ratio of 1:10, w/w) was added,
mixed gently, and incubated for 2 h in the metal bath at 37 °C.
The peptide solution from raw bovine milk samples was prepared after
passing through a 0.22 μm nylon filter.28,29 The peptide solution from BSA standards was prepared as described
above.

3.3 Dimethylation
Hundred microliters
of the peptide solution form raw bovine milk samples was added to
4 μL of 4% (v/v) CH2O for light labels, and then
4 μL of 0.6 M NaBH3CN was added to the solution.
The solution was mixed and incubated in a metal bath for 1 h at 25
°C.30 After terminating the dimethylation
reaction by adding 16 μL of 1% (v/v) ammonia, the mixture was
acidified by 8 μL of formic acid and centrifuged at 8000g for 3 min at 25 °C. Finally, the peptide solution
of the sample with the light label was made. In addition, 100 μL
of the peptide solution form BSA standards was added to 4 μL
of 4% (v/v) CH2O or 13CD2O respectively
for light and heavy labels and then was performed the same steps as
above to obtain the peptide solution of BSA with light or heavy label.
The peptide solution with the light label was diluted by isometric
heavy-labeled peptide solution, which was prepared using the BSA standard
solution throughout the experiment.

3.4 High-Resolution
Mass Spectrometry
The mixed peptide solution was analyzed
using a quadrupole-orbitrap
mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive, Thermo) equipped with a UHPLC separation
system31 (Vanquish, Thermo). Each solution
of 10 μL was separated on the Acquity BEH 300 C18 column (2.1
mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters) at 30 °C. Gradient elution
performed with a mixture of 0.1% formic acid-water (mobile phase A)
and 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (mobile phase B) at the flow rate
of 0.3 mL/min: 3% B for 0 min to 1 min; 3% B to 60% B for 1 min to
10 min; 60% B to 100% B for 10 min to 10.5 min; 100% B for 10.5 min
to 12.5 min; 100% B to 3% B for 12.5 min to 13 min; and 3% B for 13
min to 15 min. High-resolution mass spectrometry analyses were performed
using the quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer with an HESI source
in the positive-ion mode.32 Ionization
conditions were set at the sheath gas flow rate of 40 L/min, aux gas
flow rate of 10 L/min, spray voltage of 3.5 kV, capillary temperature
of 320 °C, s-lens RF level of 50, and aux gas heater temperature
of 350 °C. The acquisition mode of quadrupole-orbitrap analyses
was set to be the full MS/dd-MS2 (TopN) mode and full MS mode. Full
MS/dd-MS2 (TopN) mode is a combination of full MS mode and dd-MS2
mode. Full MS mode employed a mass scan range of 200–2000 m/z, an orbitrap resolution of 70 000
with maximum latency time of 200 ms, and target AGC values of 1 ×
106. The dd-MS2 mode employed an orbitrap resolution of
17 500 with maximum latency time of 50 ms, target AGC values
of 1 × 105, loop count of 10, stepped NCE of 25, 30,
and 35, and an isolation window of 2.0 m/z. Data analyses of high-resolution mass spectrometry were
performed using Xcalibur (Thermo) and Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (Thermo)
with the Sequest algorithm.

3.5 Peptide Selection
3.5.1 Peptide Specificity
The specificity
of tryptic peptides was confirmed by Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST) search against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), which required that the peptide length should be more than four
amino acids. For setting search criteria on the specific web page,
the algorithm was blastp (protein-protein BLAST) and no organism was
excluded. After the BLAST search, the hit number and alignment score
of each peptide were reported. For specific trypsin peptide, the hit
number means the number of interfering peptides involved. It has to
be mentioned that the results are data bank dependent; it could be
possible that they occur in more organisms, but probably the proteins
of these organisms are not investigated, and at the moment, no database
entry can be found. According to the hit number, all tryptic peptides
were divided into three grades: high (H, hit number = 0), medium (M,
1 ≤ hit number ≤ 10), and low (L, hit number ≥
11) and the grade “high” means the best peptide specificity.
The specific search web page is as follows.

https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome

3.5.2 Peptide Digestibility
A mathematical
model was established to reflect the time history of peptide production
during the tryptic digestion (Note S1).
This equation is derived from the Michaelis–Menten eq 1 1  where v is the enzyme velocity of the current
substrate concentration [S], vmax is the
maximum enzyme velocity, and KM is the
Michaelis constant.

On the basis of the operation of ordinary
differential equation and Taylor series, the function relationship
between peptide production (c) and digestion time
(t) could be expressed as eq 2 2  In
protein digestion, it is assumed that the
substrate protein would be fully digested into equimolar fully tryptic
peptides and the maximum concentration (A) of each
fully tryptic peptides would be equal to the substrate concentration
at the initial time. To simplify the fitting operation, three undetermined
parameters were set to be a, k,
and m, which were able to reflect the digestibility
of peptides as well. The final digestion equation simplified from eq 2 was expressed as eq 3 3  where a equaled A, k equaled (1 + KM/A), and m equaled vmax/A.

For the fitting of digestion
curves, the production of fully tryptic
peptides from the BSA standard with and without raw milk matrix at
different digestion times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and
120 min) was determined by high-resolution mass spectrum in full MS
mode and quantified by the light-to-heavy isotope ratio, in which
the heavy isotopic label was the heavy-labeled peptide solution of
BSA standard with 120 min of digestion time. On the basis of eq 3, the digestion curves
were fitted using PROC NLIN in SAS (version 9.4) and the iterative
method was Gauss–Newton (Figure S1). In the general equation, three variables, a, k, and m, were determined by the experimental
data of each peptide and the tryptic hydrolysis rate of each peptide
at a specific digestion time was calculated using the fitting equation
and eq 4 4  where ct is the relative response value of the peptide at time (t) of enzymatic hydrolysis, a equaled A, is the relative response value of the peptide in complete
enzymatic hydrolysis, which predicted by the fitting equation. The
tryptic hydrolysis ratio of peptides at the digestion time of 120
min was used as the evaluation index for peptide digestibility, and
on the basis of the tryptic hydrolysis ratio of each peptide from
the BSA standard with and without raw milk matrix, all tryptic peptides
were divided into three grades: high (H, both |hydrolysis ratio–100%|
≤ 5%), medium (M, both |hydrolysis ratio–100%| ≤
10%), and low (L, either |hydrolysis ratio–100%| > 10%).
The
grade high means the best peptide digestibility in peptide selection.

3.5.3 Peptide Recovery
The efficiency
of dimethlation using light or heavy label reagents and the matrix
effect of milk matrices could influence the recovery of peptides in
mass spectrometry. So the recovery of tryptic peptides was evaluated
in two aspects. The first one was the recovery in dimethylation of
each peptide, which was evaluated using the light-to-heavy ratio of
tryptic peptides from the BSA standard labeled by both light and heavy
labels. The specific experimental procedure was to mix equal amounts
of peptide solution of BSA with light and heavy label, then perform
high-resolution mass spectrometry on the mixture. When the light-to-heavy
ratio of tryptic peptide was close to 100%, it was consented that
the dimethylation labeling of one tryptic peptide was similar in both
light and heavy labeling. The other one was the recovery rate (RR)
of each peptide from spiked BSA standard in raw milk matrix. The specific
experimental procedure was to mix equal amounts of the peptide solution
of BSA with heavy label, and raw bovine milk samples with light label,
which spiked the BSA standard. Then, high-resolution mass spectrometry
was performed on the mixture. RR was calculated using the following eq 5. 5  where the detection value is the relative
response value of a specific peptide in the mixture, the original
value is the relative response value of a specific peptide in the
raw bovine milk samples, and the spiked value is the relative response
value of a specific peptide in the spiked BSA standard. According
to the RR of each peptide in both dimethylation (e.g., light-to-heavy
ratio) and raw milk matrix, all tryptic peptides were divided into
three grades: high (H, both |RR–100%| ≤ 10%), medium
(M, both |RR–100%| ≤ 15%), and low (L, either |RR–100%|
> 15%). The grade high means the best peptide recovery in peptide
selection.

3.5.4 Peptide Stability
The stability
of tryptic peptides was analyzed by the reproducibility of detection
values in dimethylation and with raw milk matrix in six parallel tests
for 3 days. The reproducibility was evaluated byan RSD of a total
of 18 tests, separately in dimethylation and in the matrix. On the
basis of the reproducibility of each peptide from the BSA standard
with and without raw milk matrix, all tryptic peptides were divided
into three grades: high (H, both RSD ≤ 5%), medium (M, both
RSD ≤ 10%), and low (L, either RSD > 10%). The grade high
means
the best peptide stability in peptide selection.

3.6 Peptide Selection Using Skyline Software
Skyline is
an application for method creation and data analysis
of targeted proteomics. It can also evaluate the quality of the peptide
signal and determine the scoring of peptide quality.27 Raw data files imported in Skyline were acquired using
UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap. The FASTA file of BSA was downloaded from Uniprot,
and the standard database was downloaded from NIST (http://peptide.nist.gov). The
proteotypic peptides were determined using the scoring of peptide
quality, which were marked as green (Figure 3E).

3.7 Method Validation
Detection of selected
peptides was performed using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)
method of a Waters TQ-XS mass spectrometer (Waters) equipped with
an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive-ion mode.31,33 The parameters of a mass spectrometer were set at a capillary voltage
of 3.0 kV, desolvation temperature of 400 °C, desolvation gas
flow of 600 L/h, and cone gas flow of 150 L/h. MRM transitions of
each peptide are shown in Table 1. The isotope internal standard solution was the peptide
solution of the BSA standard with the heavy label, and the concentration
of the BSA sample was 10 μg/mL. The isotope internal standard
solution was used to eliminate the matrix effect during ionization.
In addition, 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μg/mL standard solutions
using BSA were prepared and the peptide solution with the light label
was obtained, respectively, as mentioned in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Then,
the peptide solution of BSA was mixed with the light label and isotope
internal standard solution in equal volume. Calibration curves were
obtained by using UPLC-MS/MS to analyze the series of the mixture.
Raw bovine milk samples were processed using the same steps as above
to determine the content of BSA and the liquid-phase conditions are
referred to in Section 3.4. The acquired data were processed with MassLynx 4.1 software.
This detection method of targeted protein was validated by linearity,
sensitivity, recovery, precision, and method comparison. (a) Linearity:
The linearity of the standard curve was determined by its linear correlation
coefficient (R). (b) Sensitivity: The sensitivity
was evaluated by LOD and LOQ, which were the concentrations of the
target peptide where their signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio was 3:1 and
10:1, respectively. (c) Recovery: The RR of selected peptide was determined
using the standard addition method, in which the three spiked levels
of bovine serum albumin were 5 mg BSA/100 g raw milk, 20 mg BSA/100
g raw milk, and 50 mg BSA/100 g raw milk. Then, the RR was calculated
by referring to eq 5.
(d) Precision: Precision included intraday and interday precision.
In general, intraday precision was determined by RSD of six parallel
detection values of each sample on the same day. As for the interday
precision, the same experiment as above was performed for 3 days and
the interday precision was determined using the interday RSD of the
entire experiment.

3.8 Statistics
All
experiments were performed
in triplicates, and results are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 and Excel 2007, and the fitting
code in SAS is shown in Figure S1.
