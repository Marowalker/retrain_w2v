Characterizing
the inorganic phase of biochar, beyond determining
element concentration, is needed for appropriate application of these
materials because mineral forms also influence element availability
and behavior. Inorganics in 13 biochars (produced from Poultry litter,
switchgrass, and different types of wood) were characterized by proximate
analysis, chemical analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning
electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) spectroscopy.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compare biochars and
characterize associations between elements. The biochars were produced
using commercial-scale reactors and represent materials with properties
relevant to field application. Bulk inorganic concentration and composition
were responsible for differentiating biochars after PCA of chemical
data. In comparison, differentiation based on PCA of diffractogram
fingerprints was more nuanced. Here, contributions from cellulose
and turbostratic crystalline C influenced separation between samples.
It was also sensitive to mineral forms of Ca (whewellite and calcite).
Differences in crystalline C and Ca minerals separated two biochars
generated from the same willow feedstock using the same pyrolysis
conditions at different temperatures. PCA of 606 SEM-EDX point scans
revealed that inorganics belong to four main clusters containing Ca,
Fe, [Al, Si], and [Cl, K, Mg, Na, P, S] consistent with XRD identification
of calcite, magnetic Fe-oxide, silicates, and sylvite. It further
suggested that amorphous P-containing minerals associated with Ca
(not identified through XRD) were constituents of willow and poultry
litter-derived biochars. However, unlike PCA of XRD, it was not able
to differentiate the two biochars derived from willow. The three analysis
methods provided different perspectives on the properties of the biochar
inorganic phase. Combining information from multiple methods is needed
to better understand the inorganic composition of biochars.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biochars
are carbonaceous residues produced by pyrolysis of biomass
and are known to increase moisture retention, improve air permeability,
and improve soil structure.1 Biochars contain
an organic C (OC) and an inorganic (ash) component. Biochar OC is
defined by its condensed aromatic structure content, and this property
is rightly the subject of extensive study.2,3 However,
there have been fewer studies dealing with biochar ash and it is important
to further understand the inorganic components of biomass pyrolysis
products as these materials become more widely used.

Biochar
ash is important because of its acid neutralization potential
and because it may influence agrochemical retention, nutrient levels,
and microbial populations in soils.4 Inorganics
in biochars may come from the feedstock or may be introduced during
collection, processing, pyrolysis, or postproduction.5 During pyrolysis, ash concentrations are enriched up to
∼600 °C, above which compounds such as CaCO3 begin to decompose.6 Biochars derived
from woody material usually have low ash content (between 0.9 and
4.4 wt % ash), but high ash content of up to 70 wt % has been reported
in biochars from cow manure.6−8

It has been demonstrated
that considering ash content alone is
not sufficient at explaining the behavior of biochars. The concentration
and element composition of inorganics in biochars influence their
potential to immobilize environmental contaminants. For example, although
removal of Cr(III) was related to ash content, improved removal of
Cr(VI) was more specifically attributed to Fe-oxide concentrations
rather than total ash.9 In addition, phosphates
and carbonates in biochar produced from manure precipitated Pb from
solution.10 In a recent study, Clemente
et al. found that at acidic pH, removal of cations, such as Cd and
Ni, from solution was facilitated by the presence of compounds containing
Ca, Fe, Mg, P, and S, whereas Mn interfered with Cd and Ni removal.11 The removal of Pb and Cd from solution by manure-derived
biochar modified with MnO2 was shown to be pH-dependent
and due to different adsorption mechanisms that included electrostatic
interactions, binding to −O and −OH groups, and ion
exchange.12 Furthermore, a recent study
by Limwikran et al. demonstrated variations in the water solubility
and soil diffusivity of K and P, which the authors attributed to variations
in the crystallinity of K- and P-bearing phases.13 Therefore, it appears that mineral forms and not just element
concentrations of biochar-associated inorganics should also be considered
to fully appreciate the impact of these materials in the receiving
environment. As a step toward this understanding, determining variations
in the chemical and mineralogical compositions of a range of biochars
is needed.

Biochars are often characterized by measuring element
concentrations
to determine their potential as a nutrient or contaminant source.6−8,14,15,13 Understanding element behavior is improved
by identifying specific minerals and their abundance.5 To this end, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to
identify minerals associated with pyrolysis residues.6,7,10,13,16 Combining chemical and mineralogical data
has allowed investigators to describe nutrient release and interactions
between biochars and environmental contaminants.7,10,13 Scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) provides spatially resolved element composition
of amorphous and crystalline phases and often complements chemical
and XRD data. SEM-EDX is used to characterize biochar physical structure,
as well as the location and element composition of associated minerals.7,17−19,13,16 However, with SEM-EDX, it may be difficult to represent the diversity
in particle composition in a sample, which makes intersample comparison
challenging. One possible approach was demonstrated in a study, which
subjected SEM-EDX spectra to principal component analysis (PCA) to
understand the fossilization of algae.20 Because PCA can be used to unearth latent patterns and reveal the
main features of large data sets, the PCA of EDX spectra has the potential
to uncover the main chemical features of inorganic particles in biochars.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate conventional chemical
or mineralogical information to determine the extent of their utility
at characterizing the biochar inorganic phase. PCA of bulk chemical
and XRD data can differentiate biochars according to their main chemical
or mineralogical features, which can highlight similarities and differences
between the materials. In this study, PCA of EDX spectra will be used
to differentiate inorganic particles within the same biochar. It will
also be used to determine whether element distribution at the micron
scale is similar across different biochars. Although this approach
may not identify specific mineral phases, it may reveal the distribution
and frequency of association between elements, complement chemical
and XRD data, and may later be linked to differences in element availability
and contaminant interactions observed by others. The information obtained
using these three methods will be compared to evaluate their strengths
and weaknesses and to demonstrate that multiple methods are needed
to fully understand the nature of the inorganic phase in biochars.
This would in turn help orient their application in agriculture and
land reclamation. Biochars produced at large scales were chosen because
these represent products encountered in real-world scenarios. It is
known that feedstock, pyrolysis, and post-production conditions influence
biochar properties.2,8 Here, 13 biochars produced from
different feedstock under different large-scale pyrolysis conditions
were analyzed using chemical methods and XRD. Of the 13 samples, 8
were produced using 4 feedstock (basswood sawdust, willow, switchgrass,
and poultry litter) that were pyrolyzed using the same method operated
at two different temperatures; 10 biochars and 1 wood ash were further
characterized by SEM-EDX. A second objective was to determine whether
inorganics in biochars have a distinct signature compared to combustion
ash because the latter are known to contain high ash concentrations,
and there have been extensive studies on combustion ash.5,21−23 The biochars were compared to two wood ash from co-generation
power plants.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Feedstock and Biochar Production
Descriptions of the
feedstock and methods used to produce the biochars
and wood ash are summarized in Table 1. The method used to produce the Pyrovac biochar is
described in detail by Roy et al.,24 and
the pyrolysis units used to produce the BassWd, Willow, SGrass, and
Poultry litter biochars are described in detail by Fransham.25 The BassWd, Willow, SGrass, and Poultry litter
biochars were produced from four feedstock pyrolyzed using the same
method adjusted to two different temperatures. The bulk chemical compositions
of feedstock used to produce Airex 2, Pyrovac, Willow 450, Willow
500, SGrass 450, SGrass 500, Poultry litter 450, and Poultry litter
500 are summarized in Table 2. The feedstock composed of poultry manure and wood chips
used to produce Poultry litter biochars (Table 1) contained higher concentrations of Ca,
K, Mg, N, Na, and P, as well as lower total OC levels compared to
plant-derived feedstock (Table 2).

2.2 General Properties of Biochars
2.2.1 Organic Phase
Figure 1 compares the levels of Ca,
Fe, K, Mg, N, Na, P, and total OC in feedstock and their corresponding
eight biochar products. There was some evidence of OC loss from poultry
litter during pyrolysis since the total OC of Poultry litter biochars
did not significantly differ from its feedstock, unlike the total
OC enrichment observed with biochars produced from wood and switchgrass
(Figure 1). Furthermore,
the total OC content of Poultry litter biochar produced at 500 °C
was lower than the total OC in Poultry litter biochar produced at
450 °C, in contrast to the increased total OC with temperature
observed in Airex, BassWd, and SGrass biochars (Table 3). Similarly, Singh et al. observed increased
total OC with pyrolysis temperature for biochars produced using wood
and leaves, whereas total OC decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature
for biochars produced using poultry litter and cow manure.6 Poultry litter and manure feedstock contain high
protein concentrations, which decompose at lower temperatures than
cellulose and lignin in plant material, with consequent partial volatilization
of C.5,17

Figure 1 Relative changes in elemental content and total
organic C (OC)
from feedstock to biochar with standard error of the mean (n = 2). “Poultry” refers to biochar produced
from poultry litter. Values >0 indicate enrichment, whereas values
<0 indicate depletion of the element. Two-tailed t-tests on log10 transformed data were performed to identify
significant changes in element concentrations by comparing feedstock
and biochar concentrations at p < 0.05 (**) and p < 0.1 (*). The N measurements had
<1% difference between three and four replicates, and the average
was reported by the contracted lab; t-tests were
not performed for these data because the value of replicates were
unknown. Enrichment of selected elements and total OC in selected
biochars was calculated using the following equation: (concentration
in biochar – concentration in feedstock)/concentration in feedstock.
Fifty percent of the detection limit was used when the concentration
of an element in the feedstock was below detection limit.

Biochar total OC ranged from 46.0 to 79.6 wt % and were greater
than the WdAsh total OC of 10.2–17.0 wt % (Table 3). These values are in line
with previous studies that report biochar total C yields of 55.0–94.0%
in plant-derived biochars and 16.5–74.0% in manure-derived
biochars.2,6,26 Low total
OC (<50 wt %) in residual ash from power-generating plants (e.g.,
WdAsh) is also expected.22

The proximate
analysis results are illustrated in Figure 2. Volatile matter concentration
was highest in Airex 1, which was also pyrolyzed at lower temperatures
compared to other biochars (Table 1), whereas Airex 2 and Pyrovac had the highest fixed
matter content. Airex 1 and BassWd 400, which were pyrolyzed at lower
temperatures, had slightly acidic pH and significantly more volatile
matter compared to Airex 2 and BassWd 450 (Table 3 and Figure 2). This trend was similar to those reported by Singh
et al. in that biochars produced at 400 °C were generally more
acidic than those produced at 550 °C.6 The acidity can be attributed to acidic organic compounds that remain
after pyrolysis at lower temperatures, such as anhydrides, esters,
and carboxylic acids. These compounds are more abundant in the parent
material, and their concentrations are hypothesized to decrease with
increased pyrolysis temperatures.2

Figure 2 Ash, fixed,
and volatile matter in biochars and WdAsh determined
using ASTM D1762-84. “Poultry” refers to biochar produced
from poultry litter. Error bars show ±standard error of the mean
(n = 2). Different letters or numbers denote significant
difference between samples (Tukey’s honestly significant difference
(HSD) α = 0.05).

2.2.2 Ash and Electrical Conductivity
From proximate analysis (Figure 2), ash content was significantly higher in wood ash
(WdAsh A and WdAsh B), resulting in significantly lower fixed and
volatile matter content compared to biochars. Among biochars, those
derived from poultry litter (Poultry 450 and Poultry 500) had the
highest ash content, followed by switchgrass-derived biochars (SGrass
450 and SGrass 500). Compared to WdAsh, Poultry litter biochar had
5–34% less ash, but 7–10 times greater electrical conductivity
(EC) values (Table 3 and Figure 2). EC
is related to the amount of readily soluble ions and therefore, compared
to WdAsh, a much greater proportion of the inorganic material in Poultry
litter biochar was likely soluble. In this study, EC was influenced
by feedstock more than pyrolysis temperature. The high EC values for
Poultry litter are typical of biochars derived from manure (1.65–2.77
dS m–1).4,26

2.2.3 Potential as Nutrient Source
From Table 3, Poultry litter biochars
had much higher concentrations of N, P, and K than WdAsh, with estimated
fertilizing N/P2O5/K2O values of
2.2:10.0:8.0. WdAsh A had the second highest value with 0.2:0.3:1.5,
followed by Willow 500 with 0.9:0.8:1.4. The higher fertilizing value
of poultry litter compared to wood-derived biochars is typical and
consistent with studies reporting improved wheat and corn growth after
addition of poultry litter-derived biochar to soils.6,27 Except for Poultry litter biochars and WdAsh A, total OC/N ratios
of the samples were >60 (Table S1).
At
these high ratios, N can be immobilized by microorganisms, which limits
its availability to crops.28 However, it
should be noted that more stable OC structures are formed during pyrolysis
and that the proportion of bioavailable OC and N will determine the
availability of N to crops.29 As shown
in Figure 2, volatile
matter concentrations varied from 19 to 58 wt % in biochars and 13
to 16 wt % in WdAsh. Volatile matter content represents easily degradable
OC and is positively correlated to biochar biodegradability in soils.30,31 For example, high volatile matter concentrations of 22.5 wt % stimulated
microbial respiration and led to decreased N, P, K uptake and plant
growth for up to 5 weeks after biochar addition.30 Of the materials evaluated in this study, Airex 1, Airex
2, BassWd 400, BassWd 450, Willow 450, and SGrass 450 had volatile
matter content >23 wt % and may limit N availability to crops.
Biochars
could also become potential sources of other elements (Table S2) at levels that may not always be desired,
as discussed in Section 2, Elements of Interest, in the Supporting Information.

2.3 Bulk and Microscale Inorganic Composition
2.3.1 Differentiation
Based on Chemical Analysis
In this study, samples were digested
with aqua regia to determine
the pseudo-total concentrations of elements in relatively accessible
domains. From Table 2 and Figure 1, it
appears that although poultry litter-derived biochars had higher inorganic
content compared to the plant-derived biochars, there was relatively
greater enrichment of Ca, N, Fe, Na, K, P, and Mg during pyrolysis
of plant compared to poultry litter feedstock. Similar poor inorganic
enrichment was observed in Airex 2 (Figure 1). Although the Airex 2 feedstock contained
higher Al, Fe, Mg, N, Na, and Si concentrations than other plant-derived
feedstock (Table 2),
Airex biochars had significantly lower ash and inorganic content compared
to other plant-derived biochars (Figures 2 and 3). Loss of H2O-soluble minerals may have occurred when Airex biochars were
cooled by water atomization, and this mode of inorganic loss requires
further study.

Figure 3 (a) Average (n = 2, with error bars showing
standard
error of the mean) pseudo-total element concentrations (mmol kg–1) in biochars and WdAsh (∑[Al, As, Ba, Ca,
Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, N, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sr,
Ti, Zn, total IC]) and (b) mol % composition of the pseudo-total element
concentrations of biochars and WdAsh. The 11 elements that make up
89–93% of total inorganics in each sample are listed and the
sum of the remaining elements is included as “Others”.
“Poultry” refers to biochar produced from poultry litter.

The pseudo-total concentration
of inorganics and their composition
are shown in Figure 3. There were similarities in element composition among samples, and
19 elements made up >95 mol % of total inorganics in the biochars
and WdAsh. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S, which are the main nutrients in
plants, along with total inorganic C, Al, Fe, Na, and Si were proportionally
the most abundant inorganic elements detected in the biochars and
WdAsh (Figure 3). Nitrogen,
total inorganic C, and Ca made up 48–76 mol % of the total
inorganics in the biochars and WdAsh (Figure 3), similar to the study of Singh et al.,6 which identified N and CaCO3 as the
main inorganics in biochars. WdAsh were combusted at higher temperatures
(and in an oxygenated atmosphere) than biochar, and the lower proportion
of N in WdAsh is consistent with other studies that show an exponential
increase in volatilization of N compounds between 500 and 800 °C.19,32 Poultry litter had higher N concentrations than vegetation-type
feedstock (Table 2),
and a significant amount of this N is known to be in proteins that
decompose at >320 °C.17 Although
N
concentrations in poultry litter-derived biochars were higher than
those in plant-derived biochars (Table 3), comparison between feedstock and pyrolysis products
(Figure 1) suggests
that some N may have been lost from poultry litter during pyrolysis
through partial volatilization. Pyrolysis products identified by others
include NH3(g), HCN(g), N2, NOx, and HNCO, and the mechanism responsible for
N loss may be similar to what occurs during sewage sludge pyrolysis
discussed by Wei et al.32 Na and K were
also among the most abundant inorganic elements in Poultry litter
biochar (Figure 3),
which contained 3–362 times more Na and 5–99 times more
K than the other samples (Table 3). Poultry litter-derived biochars may contribute to
soil salinity if used as an amendment, with saline soils defined as
having EC > 4 dS m–1.33

Conventional chemical data were subjected to PCA to distinguish
biochars based on bulk inorganic element composition (Figure 4). This multivariate technique
summarizes complex data sets by combining correlated variables into
a new vector, thereby revealing relationships between samples or between
variables.34 In PCA, the amount of variation
explained by the uncorrelated principal components (PC)s decreases
in the order of PC1 > PC2 > PC3. With this method, vector and
loadings
plots display relationships between variables and PCs. In this study,
the vector and loadings plots were used to visualize how chemical,
diffraction, and spectral information were related to the PCs in terms
of magnitude and direction. From chemical analysis of the biochars
and wood ash, the first two PCs accounted for 74.0% of the sample
variance. That is, they explain 74% of the differences in the bulk
chemical composition among the 15 samples. Airex 1 and 2, which had
the lowest total element concentrations, were plotted at negative
PC1 and PC2 (Figures 3 and 4). The samples with high Si and Al concentrations
(WdAsh and Basques) occupied the positive PC1 and negative PC2 regions,
whereas the samples with high Fe and P (SGrass and Poultry litter)
occupied the positive PC1 and PC2 regions. The samples at negative
PC1 and positive PC2 regions contained similar pseudo-total inorganic
concentrations as those plotted at positive PC1 (Figures 3 and 4): Willow and WdAsh A; BasquesC, BasquesF, SGrass, and WdAsh B. This
was because in addition to pseudo-total element concentrations, concentrations
of specific elements also played a role in differentiating the samples.
Biochars and WdAsh were differentiated based on inorganic content,
followed by composition. Biochars from the same feedstock and fast-pyrolyzed
using steel shots with a difference of 50 °C (BassWd, Willow,
SGrass, Poultry litter) had similar bulk inorganic composition despite
the 50 °C difference in pyrolysis temperature (Tables 3, S1, and S2 and Figures 3 and 4). These pairs of biochars were not
differentiated from each other by PCA of traditional chemical data.
That is, feedstock had a greater influence in differentiating between
these biochar pairs.

points correspond to the following: 1 = Airex 1; 2 = Airex 2; 3 =
Pyrovac; 4 = BassWd 400; 5 = BassWd 450; 6 = Willow 450; 7 = Willow

and B are samples acid-digested with HF, as published by Beauchemin
et al.7 Loadings plots are shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S1).

For Airex 1, BassWd 400, BassWd
450, WdAsh A, and WdAsh B, the
pseudo-total (aqua regia) concentrations in this study were compared
to those published by Beauchemin et al.,7 which were prepared with an additional HF acid digestion step (Figure 4). Digestion with
HF acid resulted in (to different extents) higher inorganic concentrations,
especially for samples richer in quartz or feldspar (i.e., WdAsh; Figure 5). The extent to
which digestion method influenced the observed inorganic concentrations
was reflected in the level of separation along PC1 and was greatest
for WdAsh A.

from poultry litter.

2.3.2 Differentiation Based on X-ray Diffraction
XRD patterns have been extensively used to determine the level
of pyrolysis and to characterize the inorganic composition of biochars.2,6,7,10,13 In this study, semicrystalline minerals
were not identified in the diffractograms of Airex 1 and Airex 2 (Figure 5), likely because
of severe dilution by the organic phase, which is consistent with
their low inorganic content (Figure 3a). Quartz, calcite, and magnetic iron oxide (e.g.,
magnetite) were common features in the remaining samples (Figure 5). Contributions
from weak but distinct signals attributed to magnetic iron oxide were
detected in BassWd biochars, despite their relatively low inorganic
content (Figures 3a
and 5). As expected, intense signals attributed
to minerals were observed in WdAsh and biochars that also contained
higher inorganic content (Poultry litter, Willow, SGrass).

The
XRD patterns of Pyrovac, Basques, Poultry litter, SGrass biochars,
and WdAsh were complex, containing broad regions of semicrystalline
C and overlapping peaks (Figure 5). These features made it difficult to assign minor
peaks to specific minerals, particularly in poultry litter-derived
biochars, where several different types of silicates were tentatively
identified (labeled as various silicates in Figure 5). HyperSpec35 processing coupled to PCA of the diffractograms allowed for comparison
of the full diffraction fingerprints. Comparisons therefore did not
necessitate exhaustive peak identification and assignment. PCA was
conducted to determine the main features responsible for differences
between XRD patterns. Although diffractogram fingerprints were considered,
the PCs were still found to be related to specific signals that can
be attributed to known features in pyrolysis products (cellulose,
turbostratic crystalline carbon) and minerals (e.g., calcite, magnetic
Fe-oxide, quartz, whewellite), as indicated by the vector and loadings
plots (Figures 6 and S2).

Figure 6 Scores and vector plots (length reflects relative
influence) of
X-ray diffraction patterns of biochars and WdAsh for the first three
principal components (PCs) with % of explained variance in parenthesis:
(a) PC1 vs PC2 and (b) PC3 vs PC2. Data points correspond to the following:
1 = Airex 1; 2 = Airex 2; 3 = Pyrovac; 4 = BassWd 400; 5 = BassWd
450; 6 = Willow 450; 7 = Willow 500; 8 = BasquesC; 9 = BasquesF; 10
= SGrass 450; 11 = SGrass 500; 12 = Poultry litter 450; 13 = Poultry
litter 500; 14 = WdAsh A; 15 = WdAsh B; tcc = turbostratic crystalline
carbon. Loadings plots are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

The first three PCs captured 95.3% of the variance in the
XRD patterns
(Figure 6). According
to the vector and loadings plots, PC1 mainly corresponded to contributions
from turbostratic crystalline C (Figures 6a and S2). PC1
separated Airex and BassWd from other samples in the PC1 versus PC2
scores plot (Figures 6 and S2). Distinction of Airex and BassWd
from the other materials was consistent with their low ash and inorganic
concentrations (Table 3, Figures 2, 3, and S2). PC2 and PC3
were related to contributions from minerals, mainly quartz, calcite,
sylvite, and magnetite (Figures 6b and S2). The PC3 versus
PC2 scores plot distinguished both SGrass from other biochars because
of intense signals from magnetic Fe oxide (e.g., magnetite) in their
diffractograms (Figures 5, 6b, and S2).
Quartz and calcite were major mineral phases in WdAsh and were observed
in biochars to varying degrees; thus, WdAsh samples were not separated
from biochars (Figures 5 and 6). Poultry litter biochars were differentiated
from other samples in both XRD scores plots because their diffractograms
contained intense signals from inorganics, particularly sylvite, and
no significant signal from quartz was identified (Figures 5 and 6). Previous studies have also reported that properties of manure-based
biochars differed from plant-based biochars.6,17 That
Airex and BassWd biochars were separated from the other samples on
the basis of no or low signals from minerals, WdAsh was grouped with
biochars containing quartz and calcite, and Poultry litter (and to
some extent SGrass) were distinguished from other samples were reminiscent
of groups observed after PCA of chemical data (Figures 3–6).

Distinctions between biochars based on XRD data were not always
similar to distinctions based on chemical data. According to chemical
analysis, Airex 1 was closely related to other biochars, which was
not the case according to XRD (Figures 4 and 6). Airex 1 was pyrolyzed
at lower temperatures than other biochars (Table 1) and contained residual cellulose, which
resulted in an XRD pattern characterized by two broad peaks with maxima
at 2θ = 16 and 22° (Table 1 and Figure 5). These features were captured by PC2, and Airex 1 was separated
from other samples in both PC1 versus PC2 and PC3 versus PC2 scores
plots (Figures 6 and S2). The scores plot of XRD patterns were sensitive
to the semicrystalline C regions (cellulose and turbostratic crystalline
carbon). In addition, although chemical analysis did not distinguish
biochar pairs produced using the same feedstock and the same pyrolysis
method with a difference of 50 °C, Willow 450 was distinguished
from Willow 500 because the former contained Ca oxalate (whewellite)
and more intense crystalline C signals (Figures 5 and 6). Singh et
al. also reported the transformation of Ca oxalate to calcite when
pyrolysis temperature of eucalyptus char was increased from 400 to
550 °C.6 Using SEM-EDX and XRD, Rees
et al. also demonstrated that Ca oxalate crystals in young poplar
bark were transformed to calcite.16 The
presence of different Ca-containing minerals may affect the ability
of biochars to neutralize acidic soils. With pKa values of 1.27 and 4.28, oxalate may be less effective at
neutralizing acidic soils compared to carbonate, which has a pKa of 6.4 and 10.3.36 Although there were agreements on how biochars were sorted using
chemical and XRD data, PCA of XRD patterns provided additional information
by differentiating biochars using properties that were not apparent
from chemical analysis.

2.3.3 Microscale Frequency
and Distribution of
Elements
PCA of EDX spectra was conducted to fill in the
gaps between chemical and XRD analyses. For example, Poultry litter
biochars contained ∼44 g kg–1 P (Table 3), yet a P-containing
mineral was not identified by XRD (Figure 5). This inconsistency is likely because XRD
is not sensitive to amorphous phases. Associations between elements
at the micrometer scale that were identified through EDX point scans
may occur through reaction, crystallization, co-precipitation, sorption,
or co-localization of inorganics. PCA of the EDX spectra (representative
spectra in Figure 7) identified common associations between elements. The vector plot
in Figure 8 and the
loadings plots for PC2, PC3, and PC5 (Figure S3) illustrate how each element influenced the PCs in terms of magnitude
and direction. It should be noted that although the association between
different elements in an EDX spectrum may be consistent with the presence
of minerals identified by XRD, the application of PCA to EDX spectra
does not necessarily identify specific mineral phases, and the signal
from an element must be sufficiently intense to influence the score
of a particular spectrum. N-containing inorganics were not identified
in the EDX spectra (Figure 7). It is possible that N did not form particles that were
distinct from the biochar organic phase. Further studies are needed
to determine how N is associated with biochars.

and Fe along PC2 are also illustrated. Loadings plots represented
by the principal components are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information), and scores plots for individual
samples are plotted in Figure S4 (Supporting
Information) for clarity. Particles also consisted of mixtures of
these elements as indicated by the double-headed pink arrows in (a).
“Poultry” refers to biochar produced from poultry litter.

2.3.3.1 EDX Spectra Pattern
Distribution
The first three PCs accounted for 77.2% of the
total variance in
EDX spectra (Figure 8). PC1 and PC2 differentiated the spectra into four main groups based
on contributions from the following elements: (i) Ca, (ii) Fe, (iii)
[Al, Si], and (iv) [Cl, K, Mg, Na, P, S] (Figure 8a). These elements are also components of
mineral phases identified using XRD: Ca in calcite; Fe in magnetic
Fe oxide; Si in quartz; K, Na, Ca, Al, and Si in feldspar; and K and
Cl in sylvite (Figure 5). Spectra with signals from Ca were obtained from all biochars,
consistent with the ubiquity and abundance of Ca and calcite in the
samples (Figures 3, 5, 7, and 8). PCA of EDX spectra generated a discrete Fe-rich cluster
because of high Fe concentrations in some samples. For biochars produced
with steel pellets as heat carriers (i.e., BassWd 400, 450; Willow
450, 500; SGrass 450; and Poultry litter 450), elevated Fe was likely
due to contamination during pyrolysis. Steel from pyrolysis equipment
and materials (e.g., steel pellets) are known to be a possible source
of contaminants during biochar production.37,38

Particles in the region between the four main groups contained
mixtures of Ca, Fe, [Al, Si], and [Cl, K, Mg, Na, P, S] (Figure 8a). Mixtures of Ca
and [Al, Si] were related to minerals in the plagioclase feldspar
group. Ca and [Al, Si] mixtures were more common in Basques, WdAsh,
and Pyrovac, which was consistent with the presence of feldspar in
these samples (Figures 5, 7, 8, and S4). Furthermore, PCA of the EDX spectra places
the inorganic particles in Pyrovac, BasquesC, and WdAsh A along a
similar trajectory (Figures 8 and S4). These materials were
abundant in calcite, quartz, and plagioclase feldspar (Table 1, Figures 5, and 8). Ca silicates
are known to form during combustion, and Basques, Pyrovac, and WdAsh
were produced at higher temperatures compared to the other biochars
(Table 1). In addition,
soil contamination5 and concrete in the
traditional oven used to produce Basques biochar may be additional
sources of these minerals.

Because PCA of EDX spectra targeted
inorganic particles and excluded
C, dilution and influence of the organic phase were avoided unlike
chemical and XRD analyses. SEM-EDX allowed for analysis of elements
in biochars with low inorganic concentrations: Airex 1 and Airex 2.
Unfortunately, the PCA of EDX spectra also showed overlapping element
distributions for Willow 450 and 500 (Figures 8 and S4). Although
EDX analysis avoids the dilution effect expected in bulk chemical
analysis, both methods similarly classified these biochars in the
same group (Figures 4 and 8). Unlike XRD, EDX did not distinguish
Ca in calcite from that in whewellite, and failed to differentiate
Willow 450 from Willow 500 biochar (Figures 4 and 6). In Poultry
litter biochars, sufficiently intense EDX signals from [Al, Si] were
rarely observed, although silicates were thought to be among the main
signals in their diffractograms (Figures 5, 7, and 8). The EDX analysis was consistent with chemical
information because although Poultry litter biochars contained between
1534 and 1851 mg kg–1 Si (Table S1), it was not among the 11 most abundant elements in these
biochars (Figure 3).
The results suggest that amorphous nonsilicate minerals that are not
amenable to XRD analysis were abundant in Poultry litter biochars
(Figures 8 and S4).

2.3.3.2 Elements
in Amorphous Phases
PCA of EDX spectra can help further characterize
elements of interest
in amorphous phases. P and K are of interest as nutrients and P can
precipitate cations from solution or compete with oxyanions for sorption
sites.11,14 The filtered PC5 versus PC2 scores plot
was generated to clarify the distribution of [Cl, K, Mg, P, S]. From
the loadings plot (Figure S3), particles
that contain [Cl, K, Mg, P, S] have positive PC3 values and were simultaneously
correlated to PC5. Therefore, a filtered PC5 was generated to plot
spectra without [Cl, K, Mg, P, S] along PC5 = 0 (i.e., PC3 ≤
0) (Figure 8c). Because
P was negatively correlated to PC5, it was also separated from [Cl,
K, Mg, S] (Figures 8c and S3). This mathematical treatment
was useful for surveying P (and to some extent K), particularly in
Poultry litter and Willow biochars.

For Poultry litter biochars,
spectra with signals from [Cl, K, Mg, S] also contained signals from
Fe (Figures 7g and 8c). Fe is known to form sulfates, carbonates, and
oxides with K and Mg, although concentrations of these compounds in
combustion products are typically <0.1%.5 Coating of Fe particles by water-soluble elements can also explain
these associations. Biomass dehydration is known to occur during the
initial stages of pyrolysis2 and may promote
coating of Fe particles by water-soluble elements, including sylvite.
This hypothesis is consistent with the intensity of signals from K,
Cl, and Fe in Poultry litter biochar EDX spectra (Figure 7). It also agrees with a previous
study, which demonstrated that water-soluble Cl, K, Pb, S, and Zn
coated more stable silicates in ash from municipal waste combustion.39 In Pyrovac, BasquesC, and WdAsh A, association
of [Cl, K, Mg, S] and [Al, Si] and/or Ca likely represents feldspar
(Figures 5, 7, 8, and S4). In contrast, distinct K-containing phases were not identified
in Willow XRD patterns although K concentrations in Willow (10.0–11.4
g kg–1) were comparable to BasquesC (8.2 g kg–1) (Table 3 and Figure 5). The K signal in Willow biochars were localized and indicates association
with Ca (Figures 7, 8c, and S4). Similar associations
of [Cl, K, Mg, S] were observed in Poultry litter biochar (Figures 8c and S4). From Figure 8c, the distribution of P was constrained and was often
associated with Ca. The likely formation of Ca phosphate in Willow
is supported by the EDX spectrum in Figure 7d. Ca phosphate may also be present in other
biochars (including Poultry litter) based on data distribution in
the scores plots (Figures 8 and S4). Ca, K, Mg, and their
mixtures have been known to form phosphates and carbonates during
combustion.5 In addition, both K and P
can co-precipitate with CaCO3 and P can sorb to calcite
without necessarily forming a distinct mineral phase.40−42

PCA of EDX spectra revealed that associations between P or
[Cl,
K, Mg, S] and Ca, Fe, or [Al, Si] differed between samples (Figure 8). These associations
may have implications on sample-specific element availability and
acid-neutralizing ability. For example, sylvite in Poultry litter
biochar is water-soluble, which along with K associated with Ca carbonates
may be more readily available compared to K in feldspar from WdAsh.
In acidic soils, silicates (e.g., albite and anorthite) can be less
reactive than carbonates and phosphates (e.g., calcite and hydroxyapatite).
Literature values estimate the dissolution rate of albite to be 6
orders of magnitude lower than that of calcite at neutral pH.43,44

2.4 Inorganic Composition of
Biochars and Wood
Ash
A total of 13 biochars were analyzed and compared to
2 wood ash samples. The properties of these materials were typical
of those from the literature, considering their feedstock and pyrolysis
temperature. The known strengths and limitations of the three methods
used in this study are summarized in Table 4. PCA of bulk chemical data separated the
materials based on inorganic content and concentrations of specific
elements. This method may not be sufficient at predicting element
availability because it does not provide information on element form,
and complementary analyses are required. The intensity of cellulose
and turbostratic crystalline C relative to the intensity of minerals
influenced the classification of biochars by PCA of XRD data. PCA
of chemical, XRD, and EDX data suggest similarities between WdAsh
and Basques biochars because silicates and carbonates were common
in these samples. Among the 15 samples, WdAsh and Basques were produced
at higher temperatures in the presence of abundant (WdAsh) or low
(Basques) O2 concentrations. Poultry litter-derived biochar
and material pyrolyzed at lower temperature resulting in high cellulose
content (Airex 1) were separated from other biochars. PCA of EDX spectra
discriminated four main clusters corresponding to particles rich in
silicates, calcite, and magnetic Fe oxide, and nutrients including
P and K. It showed similar element association in materials produced
at higher temperatures: BasquesC, Pyrovac, and WdAsh. It uncovered
element association in amorphous phases. It also revealed the association
of P or K with [Al, Si], Ca, or Fe and the likely formation of Ca
phosphates. Unfortunately, PCA of EDX spectra failed to distinguish
biochars that contained minerals with the same inorganic element component,
but different mineralogy (e.g., Willow 450 and Willow 500). Nevertheless,
these results can help clarify the behavior of inorganics in biochars
and wood ash used in water treatment, agriculture, or land reclamation.
For example, nutrients (P, K, Mg, and S) associated with Ca, as observed
in Poultry litter biochar, are expected to be more available than
those associated with aluminosilicates [Al and Si], as observed in
BasquesC (hardwood) biochar or WdAsh A because calcite would be more
soluble than silicate in acidic soils. By evaluating data from three
methods, it was demonstrated that multiple techniques are needed to
appreciate the inorganic composition of pyrolysis products.

But this requires understanding the makeup of the inorganic phase

screening biochars for specific applications. Tests under laboratory
and field conditions is beyond the scope of this paper, but are needed
to confirm the relationship between these classifications, environmental
parameters, and availability of elements of interest.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Biochars and Wood Ash
Naming conventions
used in this paper, available descriptions of feedstock, and conditions
used in the production of the 13 biochars and 2 wood ash are described
in Table 1. Biochars
were acquired from the following industrial partners and commercial
producers: Pyrovac (St. Lambert de Lauzon, Quebec); Airex Industries
Inc. (Laval, Quebec; details for the Airex production were kept confidential);
Charbon de bois franc Basques (St. Mathieu de Rioux, Quebec); and
Abri-Tech Inc. (Namur, Quebec) provided the BassWd, Willow, SGrass,
and Poultry litter biochars. The WdAsh were obtained from anonymous
producers associated with co-generation power plants. Organic C functional
groups in Airex 2, BasquesF, Poultry litter 450, Pyrovac, SGrass 450,
and Willow 450 were previously characterized.11 Airex 1, BassWd 400, BassWd 450, WdAsh A, and WdAsh B were used
in a study by Beauchemin et al. on the impact of biochar on metal
leaching from mine tailings;7 Airex 2,
BasquesF, Poultry litter 450, Pyrovac, SGrass 450, and Willow 450
were used in a study by Clemente et al. on metal removal from solution.11 The feedstock for Willow, SGrass, Poultry, Airex
2, and Pyrovac were chemically characterized to evaluate differences
in element composition between feedstock and the resulting biochars.

3.2 Characterization
The pH and EC of
biochars and wood ash were measured after suspending 1 g of sample
in 20 mL of distilled water, with shaking for 1.5 h.45 The properties of 13 biochars, 2 wood ash, and 5 feedstock
used to produce 8 of the biochars were evaluated. The following standard
methods were used: ASTM D7582 for moisture content, ASTM D1762-84
for proximate analysis, and ASTM D5373 for total N. Total C was determined
by combustion using an Eltra CS-2000. The total inorganic C was determined
using the same method after removal of OC by combustion at 400–450
°C for 12 h, and the total OC was obtained by difference. Pseudo-total
concentrations of the following elements were obtained in duplicate
by microwave digestion in a mixture of HCl and HNO3 (aqua
regia): Ag, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li,
Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Se, Si, Sr, Te, Ti, Tl, V, Zn, and
Zr. Digests were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-atomic
emission spectroscopy or ICP-mass spectrometry. Elements detected
in the digestion extract, together with total N and total inorganic
C, make up the pseudo-total inorganic element concentration.

Powder XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX 2500 rotating
anode powder diffractometer using monochromatic Cu Kα radiation
at 50 kV, 260 mA, a 0.020° step scan size, and a scan speed of
1° min–1 with 2θ between 5 and 70°.
JADE v9.3 (Materials Data Inc., Livermore, CA), the Inorganic Crystal
Structure Database, and the International Centre for Diffraction Data
were used to identify mineral phases. Commercially available cellulose
(Sigmacell type 101; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO) was used to assign
2θ = 22.0, 15.8, and 34.3° to semicrystalline cellulose,
and regions between 2θ = 22.7–23.9 and 43.3–43.7°
were assigned to turbostratic crystalline C according to Keiluweit
et al.2 A total of 10 representative biochars
(Airex 1, Airex 2, Pyrovac, BassWd 400, BassWd 450, Willow 450, Willow
500, BasquesC, SGrass 450, and Poultry litter 450) and WdAsh A were
prepared for SEM-EDX by mounting loose powder on double-stick C tape
attached to an Al stub. The samples were then coated with a thin layer
of C. Secondary and backscattered electron imaging as well as EDX
were performed at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV using a Hitachi
S-3200N variable-pressure scanning electron microscope equipped with
an XFlash Bruker silicon drift detector (SDD). Semiquantitative elemental
composition of inorganic particles was determined by conducting point
analyses with the XFlash SDD, and the resulting spectra were background-corrected
using DTSA v.II.46

3.3 Statistical
Analysis
R v.3.1.1 and
the hyperSpec and factoextra packages were used for statistical analyses.35,47 The F-test two sample for variance function in
Excel indicated that the variances of the element concentrations in
the parent material and biochar were unequal. Therefore, concentrations
were log10-transformed prior to conducting two-tailed,
independent sample t-tests to determine whether differences
in element concentration between feedstock and biochars were significant.
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD)
were used to determine whether differences between means of proximate
analysis were significant (α = 0.05).

PCA of inorganic
concentrations, XRD, and EDX were calculated separately. Prior to
PCA of chemical data (Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, N, Na, Ni,
P, S, Si, Sr, Ti, Zn, and total inorganic C concentrations), values
below detection limit were coded as 0.5 × detection limit. All
values were then log-transformed and centered to stabilize variance.
The hyperSpec package was used to process X-ray diffractograms and
EDX spectra, which allows comparison of diffraction and spectral fingerprints.
XRD and EDX data were normalized to the highest count prior to PCA.
The EDX of 606 point scans from 10 representative biochars and WdAsh
A were prepared by truncating the spectra to include signals between
0.80 and 8.0 keV to avoid the overwhelming C signal, minimize the
effects of topography (expected to compromise the detection of signals
at <0.80 keV), and because only one particle had a signal at >8.0
keV. Therefore, the PCA of EDX spectra did not take into account C,
N, and O contributions.
