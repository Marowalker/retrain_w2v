The minimization of the detrimental
effects as a result of the
drastic volume changes (few hundred times) occurring during repeated
alloying–dealloying of lithium with group IV elements, e.g.,
tin (Sn), is a major challenge. An important design strategy is to
have Sn as a component in a binary compound. SnSb is an important
example where the antimony (Sb) itself is redox active at a potential
higher than that of Sn. The ability of Sb to alloy with Li reduces
the Li uptake amount of Sn in SnSb compared to that in bare Sn. Thus,
the volume changes of Sn in SnSb will expectedly be much lower compared
to that in bare Sn, leading to greater mechanical stability and cyclability.
As revealed recently, the complete reformation of SnSb (for a molar
ratio of Sn/Sb = 1:1) during charging is not achieved due to the loss
of some fraction of Sn. Thus, the molar concentration of Sn and Sb
in SnSb is also absolutely important for the optimization of battery
performance. We discuss here SnSb with varying compositions of Sn
encapsulated inside an electrospun carbon nanofiber (abbreviated as
CF). The carbon-nanofiber matrix not only provides electron transport
pathways for the redox process but also provides ample space to accommodate
the drastic volume changes occurring during successive charge and
discharge cycles. The systematic changes in the chemical composition
of SnSb minimize the instabilities in SnSb structure as well as replenish
any loss in Sn during repeated cycling. The composition plays a very
crucial role, as magnitude of specific capacities and cyclability
of SnSb are observed to depend on the variable percentage of Sn. SnSb-75-25-CF,
which contains excess Sn, exhibits the highest specific capacity of
550 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles in comparison with
pure SnSb (1:1) anode material at a current density of 0.2 A g–1 and shows excellent rate capability over widely varying
current densities (0.2–5 A g–1).

Introduction
There has been a progressive
shift in long-term strategies to harness
and store energy from renewable natural sources, e.g., solar, wind,
and hydro.1 This is expected to have 2-fold
benefits. First, the shift to renewables will decrease mankind’s
dependence on fossil fuels and related technologies. Second, the usage
of renewable technologies will pave the way for better preservation
of the global environment and lead to sustainable growth. Strategies
based on energy harvesting and storage via electrochemical means have
gained substantial momentum over the last several decades. Energy
storage using rechargeable batteries, e.g., alkali-based rechargeable
batteries, viz., Li-ion battery, have already demonstrated several
high-value opportunities for a wide range of applications.2 Lithiated transition metal oxides (e.g., LiCoO2) and graphite have been used as cathode and anode materials
in conventional intercalation-based lithium-ion batteries.3 However, the above combination of electrode materials
displays limited capabilities for applications beyond small mobile
electronic devices. In the case of graphite or as a matter of fact
for other carbon forms, e.g., carbon nanotube, fullerene, graphene,
and hierarchical carbon, operation at higher current densities leads
to degradation of the conventional liquid carbonate mixture electrolyte,
leading to an unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and poor
cyclability. Additionally, the rapid growth rate of lithium dendrites
on the electrode surface compromises operational safety.4,5 To enhance the energy density and safety of the battery at high
current densities, materials supporting higher number of exchangeable
lithium at higher redox voltage are necessary. Elements of group IV,
viz., silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn), have the potential
to form alloy with lithium and store >4 Li+ during charge–discharge
processes (vis-à-vis graphite = 0.5 Li+).6,7 Si has attracted tremendous interest from both academia and industry,
primarily due to its extraordinarily high specific capacity of 3500
mAh g–1 (volumetric capacity ∼ 2190 mAh cm–3).8 On the other hand,
Sn is an equally interesting and important alloying element. Sn delivers
a lower specific capacity (≈1000 mAh g–1)
compared to that of Si (≈3500 mAh g–1). However,
this disadvantage is offset by the high thermal stability, high electrical
conductivity, and high volumetric capacity (∼1991 mAh cm–3) of Sn.7,9 All of these material
properties make Sn a unique anode material for lithium-based batteries.

The major issue with the alloying mode of energy storage is the
enormous volume changes taking place during discharge and charge of
the battery. These volume changes severely affect the integrity of
the particle structure and morphology, resulting in a rapid rate of
capacity fading.10,11 To circumvent the volume changes,
several design strategies based on composites of Sn with carbon have
been developed.12−19 The main purpose here is to minimize the particle degradation via
optimization of the Sn particle architecture and Sn interparticle
distance, with the carbon acting as the electronic conduit for the
relevant redox process. Another important strategy for tackling volume
changes has been to synthesize binary compounds of Sn. Binary compounds
that have been investigated include CoSn3,20 Ni3Sn4,21 Cu6Sn5,22 and SnSb.23−37 The basis for selection of a binary compound instead of Sn is essentially
to buffer the drastic volume changes occurring as a result of excessive
Li (≥4.4) storage. In the case of SnSb (molar ratio 1:1), both
Sn and Sb can alloy with lithium. Sb takes up some amount of lithium
and undergoes lithiation at a higher potential. This reduces the Li
uptake amount of Sn in SnSb compared to that in bare Sn. Thus, the
volume changes of Sn in SnSb will expectedly be much lower compared
to those in bare Sn, leading to greater mechanical stability and cyclability.
To the best of our knowledge, the effect of molar percentage of Sb
on the electrochemical performance is not reported in the literature.
Recently, in operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction coupled with Mössbauer
spectroscopy has demonstrated the loss of fraction of Sn in SnSb (1:1)
on each charging.38 In this regard, the
variation in composition of SnSb can be interesting as this may lead
to optimization of the molar ratios of Sn and Sb in SnSb, which may
result in a superior Sn-based anode for commercial batteries.

Herein, we report an anode comprising of varying compositions of
Sn in SnSb entrapped inside an electrospun carbon fiber host (abbreviated
C-fiber). The carbon fiber provides both electron conducting pathways
and also free space for accommodating the volume changes during charge–discharge
cycling. Varying compositions of SnSb inside the C-fiber host is an
additional advantage, as it can be used for tuning the electrochemical
performance. Excess Sn in SnSb leads to some interesting implications
in terms of electrochemical properties and enhances the performance
of the material compared to that of the reported SnSb with equal molar
concentrations of Sn and Sb.

Results and Discussion
Lithiation
of SnSb (1:1) particles, which is referred to here as
the SnSb-50-50-CF sample (vide infra), occurs via the following mechanisms38 1   2   3   4   5  whereas the
delithiation occurs via the following
steps 6   7   8   9   10   11  Scheme 1a summarizes the
various phases of SnSb formed during discharge
and charge processes, respectively. On full lithiation, SnSb (1:1)
converts to mixture of Li3Sb and LixSn (or LimaxSn, cf. lithiation steps, eqs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). However, the conversion back to SnSb from the lithiated
phase (Li3Sb and LixSn) is
not complete and amounts to loss of some fraction of Sn. This results
in remnant amounts of Li3Sb, which converts to Sb in due
course of the charging process (cf. delithiation step, eq 11). Thus, loss of Sn from SnSb persists
as a major issue for capacity fading and commercialization of SnSb
as an anode for Li-ion battery. With this view in mind, we investigate
the electrochemical storage properties of SnSb with varying contents
of Sn. It is anticipated that higher concentration of Sn in SnSb will
be highly beneficial in minimization of the irreversible loss of Sn,
which is the key component in SnSb, leading to stable cyclability
at widely varying current densities. Additionally, the SnSb particles
are encapsulated here inside C nanofibers, which provide both electron
transport pathways as well as accommodate the drastic volume changes
occurring during the successive charge–discharge cycling. Scheme 1b,c shows the electrospinning
method, which is a versatile synthesis tool for the generation of
useful one-dimensional nanostructures with uniform diameters containing
the metal particles embedded inside it.

Figure 1 shows the
powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the as-synthesized SnSb
particles, with a varying molar composition of Sn encapsulated inside
the carbon nanofiber, in the range 2θ = 20–80°.
The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Sn-CF in Figure 1a matches exactly with the
reference pattern (JCPDS reference code: 00-001-0926, indicated by
the vertical lines). This proves that Sn particles inside the carbon
nanofibers are in the metallic state in the tetragonal crystal system
and I41/amd space group. Figure 1c,e corresponds to
the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of as-synthesized SnSb-50-50-CF
and Sb-CF compounds. They match well with the respective reference
patterns of the binary alloy SnSb (reference code: 00-001-0830) and
metallic Sb (reference code: 00-001-0802) particles, indicating formation
of high-purity compounds. Both SnSb-50-50-CF and Sb-CF compounds crystallize
in the rhombohedral crystal system.

Sn-CF, (b) SnSb-75-25-CF,
(c) SnSb-50-50-CF, (d) SnSb-25-75-CF, and (e) Sb-CF. The vertical
lines in (a, c, and e) represent the reference pattern of Sn, SnSb,
and Sb, respectively. The reference data are mentioned in respective
boxes.

The powder X-ray diffraction pattern
of SnSb-75-25-CF (Figure 1b) is a combination
of diffraction peaks of SnSb (marked as *) and Sn (marked as #), indicating an intimate mixture of Sn and SnSb. Similarly,
the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of SnSb-25-75-CF is assigned
as a combination of diffraction peaks due to SnSb (marked as *) and
Sb (marked as $) particles. The sharp peaks appearing for
all patterns indicate that the samples are generally crystalline in
nature. The diffraction patterns of carbon present in the C-nanofiber–SnSb
samples do not show up in the powder XRD pattern as it is in the amorphous
form. This is evident from the broad background observed in the powder
X-ray diffraction patterns. To investigate the thermal stability of
the as-synthesized samples, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) is carried
out under oxygen atmosphere in the temperature range (30–700
°C) (Figure 2).
The percentages of carbon present in the samples can be determined
from the weight loss around 470 °C. The carbon content in the
samples is found to vary in the range of 44% (SnSb-75-25-CF) to 55%
(Sn-CF) implying the SnSb contents to be in the range of 56–45%.
To investigate the extent of carbonization of the as-synthesized compounds
from their respective polymer fiber precursors, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra are recorded for all samples viz. Sn-CF (Figure 3a), SnSb-75-25-CF
(Figure 3b), SnSb-50-50-CF
(Figure 3c), SnSb-25-75-CF
(Figure 3d), Sb-CF
(Figure 3e), and polyacrylonitrile
(PAN) fiber (Figure 3f). The spectrum for PAN displays a characteristic band at 2250 cm–1 that can be assigned to the stretching of the nitrile
group. The band at 1663 cm–1 is assigned to C=O
stretch, whereas the absorption bands in the range 1000–1500
cm–1 are due to C–H stretching.39,40 Compared to PAN, the spectra of the various SnSb compounds (Figure 3a–e) do not
exhibit any of the significant bands of the polymer. This strongly
indicates the complete carbonization of PAN.

(PAN).

As-synthesized compounds are further
characterized by Raman spectroscopy
(Figure S1) specifically to ascertain the
nature of carbon formed in the C-nanofiber–SnSb samples. The
characteristic signature bands around 1600 and 1360 cm–1 corresponding to the G-mode and D-mode of vibrations of sp2 carbons indicate the graphitic nature of the carbon formed from
the polymer decomposition.41 To investigate
the morphology of the samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies have been carried
out. Figure S2a shows the representative
scanning electron micrograph of the electrospun polymer fibers containing
different concentrations of SnCl2 and SbCl3.
The width of the polymer fibers ranges from (100–180 nm), with
average thickness of 130 nm (represented by the histogram in the inset
of Figure S2a). The length of the fibers
is found to be more than several micrometers.

Figure S2b represents the SEM image
of the fibers after carbonization of PAN to carbon nanofibers. It
is to be noticed here that the carbonization results in the breaking
of long nanofibers into shorter fibers with nearly the same thickness.
Transmission electron microscopy image (Figure 4a) clearly shows the SnSb particles embedded
inside the carbon nanofibers. The encapsulation of the particles inside
the carbon nanofibers is shown in Figure 4b–f. The average particle size of
the SnSb particles is around 15–20 nm for all of the composites
except SnSb-25-75-CF, which exhibits particles of smaller size ≈5–7
nm embedded inside the C fiber. The embedded particles are crystalline
in nature. This is evident from the lattice fringes observed in the
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure S3) and its corresponding fast Fourier transformation (FFT). The FFT
shows spots indicating the crystallinity of the particles. The FFT
corresponding to the carbon fiber region (marked with a yellow dashed
box) is devoid of any spots, implying the amorphous nature of the
carbon fibers.

The electrochemical properties of as-synthesized compounds
are
investigated using cyclic voltammetry. The Li metal acts as both the
reference and counter electrode, and a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 and a potential window of 0.05–2 V are chosen for the cyclic
voltammetry. Figure S4a represents the
cyclic voltammogram of Sb-CF versus Li+|Li. The first cathodic
scan displays a broad peak containing two small peaks at 0.7 and 0.6
V. These are attributed, respectively, to the lithiation of Sb to
form Li3Sb and formation of a solid electrolyte interface
(SEI) due to electrolyte degradation on the electrode surface. From
the second cycle, the SEI peak at 0.6 V is not observed, indicating
that no further electrolyte degradation takes place, leading to a
stable SEI interface layer.

From the second cycle, the lithiation
of Sb occurs at a slightly
higher voltage (0.8 V) compared to that in the first cathodic scan.
The peak at 1.06 V in the anodic scan is attributed to delithiation
of Li3Sb to form metallic Sb. Figure S4b shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling
profiles (0.2 A g–1) of Sb-CF versus Li+|Li in the potential range 0.05–2.0 V. A sharp drop in the
specific capacity is observed from the first to the second cycle,
following which the stable cycling is obtained. The voltage plateaus
obtained at 0.8 and 1.1 V in discharge and charge runs are well in
accordance with the redox signatures obtained from the cyclic voltammograms. Figure S4c,d represents the galvanostatic charge–discharge
voltage profiles and the corresponding specific capacity retention
over charge–discharge cycles versus Li+|Li, as a
function of increasing current rate densities. The Sb-CF cell delivered
a stable capacity of 300 mAh g–1 (versus Li+|Li) at the end of 20 cycles at 0.2 A g–1 and a reasonably good specific capacity of 130 mAh g–1 at 5 A g–1. On reverting to 0.2 A g–1, the cell delivered a specific capacity of 260 mAh g–1. In the case of SnSb-25-75-CF, due to excess Sb phase along with
SnSb, the electrochemical behavior resembles that of Sb-CF fiber.
The first cathodic scan in cyclic voltammogram (Figure S5a) is mainly due to the contribution of carbon and
formation of stable SEI formation. The SEI once formed remains stable,
and its signature peak does not reappear in the subsequent cycles.
From the second cycle, the peak at 0.8 V in the cathodic scan is attributed
to the lithiation of SnSb and Sb phase to form Li3Sb and
Sn. Peaks in the range of 0.6–2.4 V are due to multiphasic
lithiation of Sn, which on oxidation again produces Sn at 0.66 V.
This is followed by the generation of Sb at 1.1 V to form SnSb and
extra Sb in the anodic scan. Figure S5b,c represents, respectively, the galvanostatic charge–discharge
voltage profile of SnSb-25-75-CF versus Li+|Li at a current
density of 0.2 A g–1 versus successive cycles and
the second cycle discharge as a function of various current densities,
0.2–5.0 A g–1, in the voltage range of 0.05–2.0
V, respectively. At 0.2 A g–1, SnSb-25-75-CF delivers
a specific capacity of 320 mAh g–1 at the end of
20 cycles, and at 5 A g–1, it delivers 114 mAh g–1. On reverting to 0.2 A g–1, 300
mAh g–1 of specific capacity could be achieved at
the end of 100 cycles of charge and discharge (Figure S5d). On increasing the Sn content in the precursor
from 25:75 (as in SnSb-25-75-CF) to 50:50 in SnSb-50-50-CF, no electrochemical
signatures related to Sb (as in SnSb-25-75-CF) or Sn (as in SnSb-75-25-CF,
vide infra) are observed. The cyclic voltammetry of SnSb-50-50-CF
versus Li+|Li at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 is depicted in Figure 5a. The first cathodic scan in the cyclic voltammogram contains a
peak at 0.6 V, which may be attributed to lithiation of SnSb to form
Li3Sb and Sn and formation of SEI on the electrode surface.
Four small peaks in the range of 0.5–0.2 V are attributed to
the multiphasic Sn–Li alloy formation (steps 2–5 of
lithiation of SnSb). The first anodic scan contains five closely spaced
peaks between 0.7 and 1.1 V. The first three peaks (approximately
0.68, 0.78, and 0.83 V) correspond to delithiation of Sn–Li
alloy. Peaks at approximately 1.08 and 1.14 V are due to the delithiation
of Li3Sb in the presence of Sn to form SnSb and slight
excess of Li3Sb to form Sb. These redox steps have been
highlighted as a drawback of SnSb (1:1), as some fraction of Sn becomes
unavailable in successive cycles, thus leading to a capacity lower
than the theoretical capacities. From the second cathodic scan, the
first lithiation peak in SnSb shifted to approximately 0.8 V and attributed
to the generation of Li3Sb (also seen in the Sb-CF sample)
and Sn phase. This is followed by the multiphasic lithiation process
of Sn and appears as a broader peak in the range of 0.5–0.2
V. The first anodic scan (followed by the first cathodic scan) onward,
the oxidation and reduction peaks positions remain the same in the
consecutive cycles. Figure 5b,c shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage
profile of SnSb-50-50-CF versus Li+|Li at a current density
of 0.2 A g–1 for different cycle numbers and rate
capability in the current range 0.2–5.0 A g–1 (for second cycles only). SnSb-50-50-CF versus Li+|Li
delivers a stable specific capacity of 580 mAh g–1 at the end of 20 cycles at 0.2 A g–1 and 250 mAh
g–1 at 5 A g–1. On reverting to
0.2 A g–1, a capacity of 520 mAh g–1 is obtained, which is in close proximity to capacities obtained
in the initial run.

A g–1, (c) capacity versus cycle number plot of
and (d) rate capability of SnSb-50-50-CF versus Li+|Li.

When the relative molar ratio
of Sn to Sb increased from 50:50
to 75:25 in compound SnSb-75-25-CF, the electrochemical redox signatures
shifted toward that of Sn. Figure 6 represents the electrochemical properties of SnSb-75-25-CF
versus Li+|Li. The first cathodic scan in the cyclic voltammogram
(Figure 6a) is dominated
by lithiation into the carbon fiber and SnSb phase. At the lower voltage
ranges, the peaks at approximately 0.45, 0.37, and 0.24 V are attributed
to the multiphasic alloy formation between Sn and Li. In the first
anodic run, similar redox peaks are observed as those in SnSb-50-50-CF
compound. Peaks at approximately 0.68, 0.77, and 0.83 V represent
multiphasic delithiation of Sn–Li alloy, and the peak at approximately
1.1 V is attributed to delithiation of Li3Sb to form SnSb
in the presence of Sn. Figure 6b represents the galvanostatic charge–discharge voltage
profiles for different cycle numbers at a constant current density
(0.2 A g–1). The rate capability of this material
has been tested at different current densities ranging from 0.2–5.0
A g–1, and the corresponding specific capacities
obtained have been represented in Figure 6d. Initially, the cell provides a specific
capacity of 615 mAh g–1 at a current density of
0.2 A g–1 after 20 cycles. On increasing the current
density stepwise, the cell provides a specific capacity of 265 mAh
g–1 at 5.0 A g–1. The specific
capacity recovered to 560 mAh g–1 following the
revert to 0.2 A g–1. The electrochemical properties
of Sn-CF versus Li+|Li have been represented in Figure S6. The cyclic voltammogram (Figure S6a) of Sn-CF shows peaks at approximately
0.52, 0.42, and 0.24 V in the first cathodic scan, which is attributed
to the formation of SEI and lithiation of Sn to form Sn–Li
alloy. The first anodic scan has the redox peaks at approximately
0.51 and 0.69 V, which are due to the delithiation of Sn–Li
alloy. The broad peak at approximately 1.2 V is attributed to the
delithiation from the partially disordered nature of the carbon of
the carbon fiber.42Figure S6b,c represents the galvanostatic charge–discharge
voltage profile in the voltage range 0.05–2.0 V at a current
density of 0.2 A g–1, with increasing cycle numbers,
and at second discharge cycle, with increasing current density of
0.2–3.0 A g–1, respectively. The capacity
value obtained in the rate capability test is 358 mAh g–1 after 20 cycles at 0.2 A g–1, and with stepwise
increase in the current rate, 119 mAh g–1 specific
capacity can be achieved at 3.0 A g–1. Further,
on setting the current rate to its initial value (=0.2 A g–1), the cell delivers a capacity of 256 mAh g–1 after
100 cycles (Figure S6d).

cycle numbers of SnSb-75-25-CF versus Li+|Li (at 0.2 A

compositions (at 0.2 A g–1) and (d) rate capability
of SnSb-75-25-CF versus Li+|Li (current rate densities:
0.2–5 A g–1).

To investigate the long-term cyclability of the series of
the as-synthesized
compounds, the cells are subjected to discharge and charge at a constant
current of 0.2 A g–1 in the potential window of
0.05–2.0 V. As shown in Figure 6c, all of the cells undergo an initial irreversible
capacity loss in the first discharge; however, from the second cycle
onward, the losses diminish quite significantly. The irreversible
capacity loss from the first to the second cycle is mainly attributed
to the formation of the SEI. This is also observed in the cyclic voltammograms,
where following the first cathodic scan, the redox peaks in both cathodic
and anodic scans are nearly reversible with increasing cycle numbers
and correspond to the redox activity of metal particles with lithium.
This implies that the charge storage mainly takes place in the metal
particles and not in the carbon fibers. Figure 6c shows the capacity fading is most prominent
in Sn-CF compared to that in the other compounds. Second discharge
capacity of Sn-CF is 501 mAh g–1, which is reduced
to 329 mAh g–1 at the 50th cycle, implying capacity
fading of 34% with respect to the second discharge cycle. The capacity
gradually decreases with cycling, and at the 100th cycle it is found
to be 250 mAh g–1, implying a further capacity fade
of 24% in 50–100 cycles of galvanostatic charge–discharge
in Sn-CF. However, in the case of Sb-CF, the capacity fading is less
prominent, being nearly 23% in the first 50 cycles (with respect to
second discharge capacity, 391 mAh g–1) and nearly
9.3% between 50 and 100 cycles. This is mainly due to the lower volume
expansion of Sb (200%) with respect to Sn (260%) and lower amount
of lithium storage in the discharge process against Li+|Li.500 After 100 cycles, Sb-CF displays
a discharge capacity of 272 mAh g–1. In the case
of SnSb-25-75-CF, an almost similar trend of capacity retention is
observed and the specific capacity is found to be 331 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles, which is higher than that of the Sb-CF (and Sn-CF),
as expected due to the presence of the SnSb phase.

In the case
of SnSb-50-50-CF, stable capacities of 535 and 511
mAh g–1 are observed at the 50th and 100th cycles
of galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling. However, excess
Sn in SnSb phase (as in SnSb-75-25-CF) helps in improving the specific
capacity compared to that of SnSb-50-50-CF. The specific capacity
for SnSb-75-25-CF is 600 mAh g–1 after 50 cycles
and 552 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles. The capacity fading
of SnSb-75-25-CF (cf. Figure 6c) is slightly higher (∼14.8% at the 50th cycle with
respect to the second discharge capacity and 7.3% between 50 and 100
cycles) compared to that of SnSb-50-50-CF (∼13.8% at 50th cycle
compared to second discharge capacity and ∼4.4% in between
50 and 100 cycles). Figure 7 represents the electrochemical performance of SnSb series
of compound as a function of the percentage of Sn presence in the
compounds. It is found that after 100 cycles, SnSb-75-25-CF delivers
the highest capacity. The superior performance of SnSb-75-25-CF over
that of SnSb-50-50-CF can be explained by comparing the anodic current
regime of cyclic voltammogram (Figure 7b). Because the failure mechanism of SnSb is associated
with the loss of Sn and corresponding formation of Sb from Li3Sb, a careful analysis of the voltage range (1.0–1.2
V) becomes necessary. In SnSb-50-50-CF, as a consequence of incomplete
formation of SnSb at approximately 1.08 V due to less availability
of Sn, a prominent peak of Li3Sb-to-Sb conversion appears
approximately at 1.14 V. Unlike SnSb-50-50-CF, the peak of Li3Sb-to-Sb formation at 1.14 V is absent in SnSb-75-25-CF. This
suggests that there is no excess Li3Sb phase and there
is complete formation of SnSb phase. The presence of extra Sn in close
proximity of SnSb particles replenishes the loss of Sn while charging
to form SnSb. In the case of SnSb-25-75-CF, two peaks can be observed
within 1.0–1.2 V range, with slight changes in the potential
and are mainly dominated by the Li3Sb-to-Sb formation peak,
as the amount of Sb present in the compound is higher compared to
that of SnSb particles.

Figure 7 (a) Bar diagram of specific capacity versus
the percentage of Sn
present in SnSb series of compounds. Percentages of Sn present are
0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% in Sb-CF, SnSb-25-75-CF, SnSb-50-50-CF, SnSb-75-25-CF,
and Sn-CF, respectively. (b) Comparison of anodic current regime of
cyclic voltammogram of SnSb-50-50-CF, SnSb-75-25-CF, and SnSb-25-75-CF.

In addition to the evidence provided
by the cyclic voltammograms,
the complete reformation of SnSb in presence of excess Sn (as in SnSb-75-25-CF)
is also supported by the dQ/dV versus
voltage (V) plots obtained from the galvanostatic
voltage profile of the first charge (Figure S7). The peaks observed at 0.98 and 1.04 V in the dQ/dV versus voltage (V) plot are
similarly observed in the cyclic voltammogram of SnSb-50-50-CF compound,
where no excess Sn is present. Similar observations have also been
reported in the literature. However, in the presence of excess Sn,
as in SnSb-75-25-CF, the dQ/dV versus
voltage (V) plot gives rise to only one peak, indicating
complete reformation of SnSb. This is also in accordance with the
cyclic voltammogram of SnSb-75-25-CF. To identify Sb as the final
product of delithiation from excess Li3Sb, ex situ powder
XRD was carried out (Figure S8). However,
no signatures of Sb in the ex situ powder XRD pattern for either of
SnSb-50-50-CF and SnSb-75-25-CF was obtained. The absence of diffraction
lines of Sb indicates that the formed Sb is amorphous in nature but
electrochemically still active. This is in full accordance with published
ex situ and in situ results.31,38,43 In this context, an investigation of the morphology and microstructure
of SnSb-75-25-CF following cycling is studied using SEM and TEM (Figure S9). The retention of the fibrous morphology
(Figure S9a) with similar diameter of the
carbon fiber composite strongly suggests that the expansion of carbon
fiber is small and the particles are well dispersed inside the carbon
fibers. This is evident from the postcycling bright field TEM image
of SnSb-75-25-CF (Figure S9b). Moreover,
the particle size remains similar inside the fiber host, which suggests
that the agglomeration of Sn or SnSb particles is minimal. The agglomeration
of Sn or SnSb particles is restricted due to encapsulation of the
particles inside the carbon fiber. Additionally, encapsulation of
particles inside the porous CF (average pore size distribution of
2–5 nm and the pore volume is 0.065 cm3 g–1)26 is highly beneficial as it fully controls
the volume expansion of the particles during continuous battery cycling.
Thus, no special binders, such as such as poly(acrylic acid) or carboxy
methyl cellulose, are employed here in the work. Poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF), a commonly used binder, is used and is sufficient for holding
the carbon fiber composite to the copper current collector.

Conclusions
In conclusion, various molar ratios of Sn to Sb in SnSb particles
encapsulated within an electrospun carbon fiber matrix have been investigated
as prospective anode material for lithium-ion battery. The percentage
of Sn present in the sample is crucial for the redox activity and
eventually for the battery performance. Equal molar fractions of Sn
and Sb result in irreversible loss of Sn during lithiation, resulting
in incomplete reformation of SnSb particles during the charging (delithiation)
process. The presence of extra Sn in close proximity with SnSb particles
is necessary for the reformation of SnSb completely during changing.
Fulfilling this extra requirement of Sn, SnSb-75-25-CF exhibits the
best battery performance compared with SnSb-50-50-CF, which contains
only pure SnSb phase. It is envisaged that the study presented here
will aid in the improvement of performance of other reported intermetallic/alloy
of group IV elements, where detailed concentration-dependent studies
have not been performed. The alloying form of storage is equally important
for electrochemical storage chemistries beyond lithium, and this study
will definitely aid in screening chemical compositions, leading to
stable cyclability over a wide range of currents. The findings here
are also expected to be of relevance to battery material databases
where compound properties are estimated from various theoretical models.44

Experimental Section: Materials and Methods
Synthesis
of Materials
The SnSb–carbon fiber
composites are synthesized using the electrospinning technique using
the optimized parameters and sintering method described in our previous
work, ref (26). First,
0.4 g of polyacrylonitrile (PAN; MW = 150 000, Aldrich) is
dissolved in 4 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF, Spectrochem Pvt. Ltd.)
by stirring the solution for 8 h at 70 °C. Separately, another
solution is prepared by dissolving various amounts of SnCl2 and SbCl3 in 4 mL of DMF by stirring for 2 h. The two
solutions are mixed together and stirred for 8 h to obtain the precursor
solution for electrospinning. The solution is loaded in a 5 mL syringe,
and the needle of the syringe is connected to the high-voltage power
supply of the electrospinning setup (Physics Equipments Co., Chennai,
India). The flow rate of the solution is maintained at 0.5 mL h–1, and the voltage difference between the tip of the
needle and the aluminum sheet-covered metallic drum collector is kept
at 18 kV. The distance between the needle and collector is kept at
15 cm. A Taylor cone is formed at the tip of the needle due to the
electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged needle and
drum collector, followed by the polymer jet formation that gets dried
in air and collected on the rotating drum (∼2000 rpm). This
results in a formation of a white polymer mat composed of PAN and
the metal chlorides. The mat is removed from the aluminum sheet and
stabilized at 280 °C in air (oxygen) for 3 h at a heating rate
of 5 °C min–1. The resultant brownish composite
is again heat-treated at 700 °C for 3 h at the same heating rate
in a reducing atmosphere maintained by flowing Ar/H2 (95:5,
v/v) to obtain nanoparticles-embedded graphitic carbon fibers. The
molar ratio of SnCl2 and SbCl3 is taken as 0:100,
25:75, 50:50, 75:25, and 100:0 and the final compound correspondingly
termed as Sb-CF, SnSb-25-75-CF, SnSb-50-50-CF, SnSb-75-25-CF, and
Sn-CF, respectively.

Instrumentation and Methods
The
powder X-ray diffraction
patterns of the as-synthesized samples are recorded using a Philips
X’pert diffractometer (nickel filter fitted) using Cu Kα
radiation, (λ = 1.5418 Å, voltage = 40 kV; current = 30
mA) in the 2θ range of 20–80°. A Mettler Toledo
thermogravimetric system is used to perform thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) from room temperature (30 °C) to 700 °C, with a heating
rate of 5 °C min–1 under oxygen atmosphere.
A Perkin Elmer Fourier transform infrared spectrometer with Spectrum
2000 software is used to record Fourier transform infrared spectra
(FTIR) at a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. A LabRam
HR system with a 532 nm diode pump solid-state laser has been used
to collect the Raman spectra of the as-synthesized samples. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) has been performed on a FEI FEG 250 ESEM
machine. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) are recorded on JEOL 2100F
(equipped with field emission gun). Cyclic voltammetry of the samples
is carried using CH-Instruments (CH608C) in the voltage range of 0.05–2.0
V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1. Arbin Corp. (model
BT 2000) is used for galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling at different
current densities ranging from 0.2 to 5 A g–1 in
the voltage range of 0.05–2.0 V (versus Li+/Li).

Electrochemical Cell Assembly
The electrochemical properties
of the electrode materials in the Li-battery configuration are extensively
studied using Swagelok cells with 1 M LiPF6 in a 1:1 volume
ratio of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate as electrolyte,
lithium foil (Aldrich, thickness = 0.75 mm) as a counter and reference
electrodes, and absorptive glass mat as the separator. A slurry is
first prepared with the electroactive material and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (PVDF, Kynarflex) in the weight ratio of 90:10 in cyclopentanone.
No additional carbon is used as the electroactive material itself
contains graphitic carbon fibers that serve the role of electrical
conduits. The slurry is cast on a battery-grade high-purity clean
copper foil and dried overnight at atmospheric temperature. All cell
assemblies are done inside a glovebox (MBraun) under argon atmosphere
(H2O < 0.5 ppm, O2 < 0.5 ppm).
