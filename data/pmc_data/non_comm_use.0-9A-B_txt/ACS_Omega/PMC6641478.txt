Strong, flexible,
and transparent materials have garnered tremendous
interest in recent years as materials and electronics manufacturers
pursue devices that are bright, flexible, durable, tailorable, and
lightweight. Depending on the starting components, polymers fabricated
using thiol–yne chemistry have been shown to be exceptionally
strong and/or flexible, while also being amenable to modification
by the incorporation of nanoparticles. In the present work, novel
ligands were synthesized and used to functionalize quantum dots (QDs)
of various diameters. The functionalized QDs were then incorporated
into thiol–yne prepolymer matrices. These matrices were subsequently
polymerized to form QD thiol–yne nanocomposite polymers. To
demonstrate the versatility of the fabrication process, the prepolymers
were either thermally cured or photopolymerized. The resulting transparent
nanocomposites expressed the size-specific color of the QDs within
them when exposed to ultraviolet irradiation, demonstrating that QDs
can be incorporated into thiol–yne polymers without significantly
altering QD expression. With the inclusion of QDs, thiol–yne
nanocomposite polymers are promising candidates for use in numerous
applications including as device display materials, optical lens materials,
and/or sensor materials.

1 Introduction
Thiol–yne
chemistry, a major subset of the thiol “click”/coupling
family, is an increasingly popular tool used by polymer chemists to
produce unique functional materials.1−5 This popularity is due, in part, to the ease with which thiol–yne
reactions can occur,6 the orthogonality
thiol–yne reactions provide with other reactions,7−9 and the extensive range of properties (i.e., mechanical, optical,
and thermal) exhibited within materials fabricated from thiol–yne
chemistry.3,4,10,11 Polymers fabricated via thiol–yne chemistry
can be biocompatible,11,12 rubbery,13 stiff,14 high in refractive index,2,15,16 transparent,15 stable at high temperatures,15 and surface chemistry can be performed on them during postpolymerization
modification processes.17 Furthermore,
thiol–yne polymers can be modified by nanoparticle (NP) inclusions18,19 to create polymer nanocomposites.20 This
variety of possible polymer properties highlights the assortment of
ways thiol–yne polymers can be made tailorable and/or multifunctional.
Thus, research on polymers fabricated using thiol–yne chemistry
is uniquely valuable.

The goal of this report is to show the
viability of polymers fabricated
via thiol–yne chemistry as host matrices for quantum dots (QDs)
to develop luminescent nanocomposite materials for potential use in
applications such as electronic device displays. There has been a
major industrial push to utilize QDs in electronic device display
materials (e.g., televisions and mobile phones) because of the stability,
the improvement in color contrast, and the energy efficiency QDs can
provide in comparison to other luminescent materials.21−24 We recently demonstrated that functionalized metallic NPs can be
readily incorporated into thiol–ene and thiol–yne polymers18 and that molecules on the surfaces of the incorporated
NPs can be detected via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for potential
use in sensor applications.19 Perhaps most
importantly, it was determined that the characteristic transmission
peaks associated with well-dispersed gold NPs (AuNPs) can be maintained
within AuNP thiol–yne nanocomposites.18 Using novel ligands and a unique NP functionalization process, we
now demonstrate the ability to incorporate functionalized, luminescent
QDs into thiol–yne polymers yielding photoluminescent QD thiol–yne
nanocomposites while maintaining the QD emission character within
the nanocomposites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Multifunctional Ligand Syntheses
As-synthesized QDs
were coated with organic ligands that are nonreactive
toward thiol–yne chemistry. Therefore, the QD surfaces were
treated with custom organic ligands (Scheme 1) to present the desired functional groups
through a ligand-exchange (i.e. cap-exchange) process (Scheme 2). Because of the high affinity
of thiol groups for the ZnS surfaces of QDs, alkyne groups were the
best choice as the ligand terminus to be available for active participation
in the polymerization chemistry. Two ligands were synthesized for
the purpose of coating the QD surfaces: (1) a reactive dihydrolipoic
acid (DHLA)–alkyne and (2) an inert DHLA–butyl ligand
to aid in solubility. The synthesis steps leading to the preparation
of the multifunctional ligands are detailed in Scheme 1.

the QDs before and after Ligand Cap Exchange
Both ligands were synthesized from lipoic acid (LA), which
contains
a dithiolane ring that can be easily reduced to a dithiol (Scheme 1). Ligands based
on these dithiol groups have been shown to bind strongly to QD surfaces,
minimize ligand desorption (compared to monothiol ligands), and provide
functionalized and highly stable colloidal solutions. Minimal ligand
desorption and good colloidal stability are critical parameters for
obtaining uniform dispersion of QDs into polymer matrices. To obtain
the inert DHLA–butyl ligand, the carboxyl group of LA was coupled
to butylamine via carbonyldiimidazole to form LA–butyl. Next,
the disulfide bond was reduced to a dithiol using sodium borohydride.
The same approach was taken to synthesize the DHLA–alkyne ligand.
LA was coupled to N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-hexynamide via
carbonyldiimidazole to form LA–alkyne, which was subsequently
reduced using sodium borohydride to yield DHLA–alkyne.

2.2 QD Thiol–yne Nanocomposite Fabrication
There
have been a number of reports of silica NPs25−28 and metallic NPs18,19,29 being incorporated into thiol–ene
and thiol–yne polymers
in recent years. Functionalizing NPs with ligands reportedly improves
the incorporation of the NPs into thiol–ene and thiol–yne
prepolymer solutions.25 Furthermore, functionalizing
NPs with ligands that can interact with the polymer matrix via alkene/alkyne
functional groups can be performed while avoiding significant NP aggregation
in the final polymer.18 Previously, Jin
et al. incorporated QDs into thiol–ene polymers in a layer-by-layer
thin-film fabrication assembly process; however, their report focused
on the polarity of the solvents used in the processing and included
a more complex procedure to develop their photopolymerizable resins.30 Kim, et al. demonstrated that polymers containing
functionalized QDs could be micropatterned onto substrate surfaces
via thiol–ene chemistry and imprint lithography using a three-step
process.31 More recently, Smith, et al.
presented a method for incorporating QDs into thiol–ene polymers
where they focused on synthesizing QD thiol–ene nanocomposites
at varying QD loading percentages using butylamine-capped QDs.32 In that report, it was noted that QD aggregation
could be avoided under certain conditions and that the thiol–ene
ultraviolet (UV) photopolymerization process utilized was amenable
to soft lithography processes.32

Because of the known advantages in some of the mechanical properties
provided by thiol–yne polymers in comparison to thiol–ene
polymers,8,14,33,34 it was the goal of the present work to determine
if QDs could be readily incorporated into thiol–yne polymers
while also avoiding QD aggregation and quenching of QD characteristic
expression. It was previously shown that NP aggregation within thiol–ene
and thiol–yne polymers could be avoided by functionalizing
the NPs with ligands having ‘clickable’ end groups.18 Thus, the ligands synthesized and used to functionalize
the QDs in the present report were designed to have alkyne end groups
that could ultimately lead to well-distributed QDs within the thiol–yne
polymers.18 Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) verified the presence and distribution of the QDs within the
thiol–yne prepolymers (Figure 1c inset; Figure S2). The
incorporation of functionalized QDs into the thiol–yne prepolymers
merely required adding the thiol–yne prepolymer to the QD solution
in a glass vial followed by vigorous agitation (<5 s) (Scheme 3). This formed a
uniform prepolymer solution that exhibited the characteristic color
(which is based on the QD diameter and compositions) of the QDs present
within the prepolymer. At this point, the prepolymer could be drop-cast
onto a substrate, spin-coated onto a substrate, or poured into a mold
and polymerized (Figure S1).

Scheme 3 Schematic Showing the QD Thiol–yne
Nanocomposite Fabrication
Process
While thermal curing
only required the heating of the prepolymer
solution, photopolymerization required the addition of a photoinitiator
and exposure to long-wave (∼365 nm) UV energy. To better concentrate
the QDs prior to photopolymerization, the remaining QD solvent present
in the QD thiol–yne prepolymer solution was evaporated away
by slightly heating the solution. Once the QDs were functionalized,
the QD incorporation and subsequent polymerization process was performed
on a minutes timescale, even when evaporating away solvent was necessary. Figure 1a,b shows the transparency
of the molded material, and Figure 1c reveals the location of the red QD thiol–yne
nanocomposite within the overall material. Following polymerization
using either process, the QD thiol–yne nanocomposites exhibited
the characteristic color of the QDs within them by illumination under
a UV lamp (Scheme 3).

2.3 QD Thiol–yne Nanocomposite Properties
All of the nanocomposites fabricated were transparent, showing
only a slight tint of color that was dependent on the color of the
QDs present within them (Figure 1). PL analysis showed only a slight shift in QD emission
after the QDs were incorporated into the thiol–yne polymers,
demonstrating that in addition to transparency, the luminescent integrity
of the QDs was also maintained (Figures 2 and S3). In comparison
to native thiol–yne, there was only a slight decrease in the
refractive index, glass transition-temperature, and degradation temperature
for the QD thiol–yne nanocomposites, indicating that (aside
from the QD emission colors) addition of the QDs had little effect
on the optical and thermal character of the overall thiol–yne
material (Table 1).
Of all the optical and thermal properties analyzed, in addition to
the expression of color, the most significant difference between the
native thiol–yne polymer and the QD thiol–yne nanocomposites
was evidenced in the decreased degradation temperature. That said,
the decrease in degradation temperature with the incorporation of
QDs is consistent with previous reports in which the degradation temperature
of thiol–ene polymers29 and thiol–yne
polymers19 decreased upon addition of AuNPs.
Overall, these data show that the QDs can be incorporated and well-dispersed
within thiol–yne polymers with minimal change to the desirable
thiol–yne polymer optical and thermal properties, while maintaining
the characteristic expression of the color of the QDs.

3 Conclusions
Novel,
multifunctional ligands were synthesized and utilized to
functionalize QDs of various sizes. These functionalized QDs were
incorporated into a thiol–yne prepolymer matrix in a simple
process of agitation and solvent evaporation. Following incorporation
of the QDs into the thiol–yne prepolymer, it was shown that
QD thiol–yne nanocomposites could be fabricated by thermal
curing or by photopolymerization. The QDs were incorporated into the
thiol–yne nanocomposites with little change in the overall
thiol–yne optical and thermal properties when compared to thiol–yne
polymers devoid of QDs. Similarly, there was virtually no change in
the QD characteristic expression following incorporation into the
thiol–yne polymer matrix. These processes should be easily
transferrable to thiol–ene chemistry and potentially to other
reactions within the click chemistry family. The method for the functionalization
and incorporation of QDs into thiol–yne prepolymers outlined
in this report should also be possible with other types of QDs and
NPs. The relative transparency, in combination with the desirable
optical and thermal properties so often seen with thiol–yne
polymers, makes these materials potential candidates for use in numerous
photoluminescent material applications.

4.3 Synthesis of LA–Butyl
LA (0.50
g, 2.4 mmol) and carbonyldiimidazole (0.43 g, 2.7 mmol) were added
to a 100 mL round-bottom flask, sealed, and purged with N2(g). Dry chloroform (15 mL) was added by a syringe and stirred for 1

added dropwise to a stirred solution of butylamine (311 μL,
3.1 mmol) in chloroform (15 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred
overnight at room temperature under N2(g). The solvent
was removed under vacuum, and the residue was separated on silica
gel with 15:1 CHCl3/MeOH as the eluent. The fast-moving
yellow band was collected and the solvent evaporated. The crude product
was dissolved in diethyl ether (50–60 mL) and washed with deionized
(DI) water (3 × 15 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. This yielded the
product (531 mg, 84%) as a yellow residue. Thin-layer chromatography Rf ≈ 0.67, CHCl3/MeOH = 10:1

4.5 Synthesis of N-(2-Aminoethyl)-5-hexynamide
N-(2-Aminoethyl)-5-hexynamide
was synthesized
as previously described,35 with slight
modification. Briefly, 5-hexynoic acid (0.50 g, 4.5 mmol) and carbonyldiimidazole
(0.80 g, 4.9 mmol) were added to a 100 mL round-bottom flask, sealed,
and purged with N2(g). Dry chloroform (25 mL) was added
by a syringe and stirred for 1 h. The activated 5-hexynoic acid mixture
was transferred by a syringe to an addition funnel and added dropwise
to a stirred solution of tert-butyl N-(2-aminoethyl)carbamate (0.72 g, 4.5 mmol) in chloroform (20 mL).
The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature under
N2(g). The solvent was removed under vacuum, and diethyl
ether (30 mL) and DI water (20 mL) were added to the residue and stirred.
The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, and the organic
phase was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with diethyl
ether two more times. The organic phases were combined, dried over
Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. The crude
residue was separated on silica gel with 15:1 CHCl3/MeOH
as the eluent to afford the product (0.715 g, 63%) as a solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 6.13 (s, 1H), 4.87 (s,
1H), 3.36 (m, 2H), 3.27 (m, 2H), 2.32 (t, 2H, J =

acid as previously described37 to yield N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-hexynamide [trifluoroacetyl (TFA) salt].

4.6 Synthesis of LA–Alkyne
LA
(0.579 g, 2.81 mmol) and carbonyldiimidazole (0.50 g, 3.1 mmol) were
added to a 100 mL round-bottom flask, sealed, and purged with N2(g) (Scheme 1). Dry chloroform (20 mL) was added by a syringe and stirred for
1 h. The activated LA mixture was transferred by a syringe to an addition
funnel and added dropwise to a stirred solution of N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-hexynamide (TFA salt) (0.753 g, 2.81 mmol) and
triethylamine (0.78 mL, 5.6 mmol) in chloroform (30 mL). The reaction
mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature under N2(g). The solvent was removed under a reduced pressure. The residue was
dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 mL) and washed with 0.1 M K2CO3 (2 × 20 mL). The organic phase was dried over
Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness.
The residue was dissolved in minimal 15:1 CHCl3/MeOH, filtered,
and separated on silica gel with 15:1 CHCl3/MeOH yielding
the product as a pale yellow waxy residue (0.588 g, 58%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 6.15 (s, 2H), 3.57 (m, 1H), 3.4
(m, 4H), 3.08–3.20 (m, 2H), 2.48 (m, 1H), 2.33 (t, 2H, J = 7.4 Hz), 2.25 (td, 2H, J = 6.7, 2.7
Hz), 2.20 (t, 2H, J = 7.4 Hz), 1.98 (t, 1H, J = 2.7 Hz), 1.82–1.96 (m, 4H), 1.61–1.75
(m, 4H), 1.41–1.53 (m, 2H).

4.7 Synthesis
of DHLA–Alkyne
LA–alkyne
(0.588 g, 1.63 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (15 mL)
in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. DI water (5 mL) was added, and the
mixture was purged with N2(g). Sodium borohydride (0.185
g, 4.89 mmol) was added to the LA–alkyne solution and stirred
for 4 h (Scheme 1).
The THF was removed under a reduced pressure, and then, chloroform
(20 mL) was added, followed by brine (60 mL). The mixture was transferred
to a separatory funnel, and the organic phase was separated. The aqueous
phase was extracted with chloroform two more times. The organic phases
were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered,
and then evaporated to dryness. This afforded the product (0.523 g,
88%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): 6.15 (s, 2H), 3.40 (m, 4H), 2.92 (m, 1H), 2.70 (m, 2H), 2.33 (t,
2H, J = 7.5 Hz), 2.26 (td, 2H, J = 6.9, 2.7 Hz), 2.20 (t, 2H, 7.4 Hz), 1.98 (t, 1H, J = 2.5 Hz), 1.81–1.86 (m, 4), 1.38–1.81 (m, 6H), 1.36
(t, 1H, J = 7.8 Hz) 1.30 (d, 1H, J = 7.9 Hz).

4.8 QD Cap Exchange
As-synthesized QDs
(3 nmol) were precipitated from stock solutions with acetone, centrifuged
to form a pellet, and the supernatant was discarded. The QD pellets
were mixed with a chloroform solution (1–1.5 mL) of DHLA–alkyne
(30%) and DHLA–butyl (70%) at an excess of 30 000 ligands
per QD (Scheme 2).
The mixture was sealed under nitrogen and heated overnight at 45 °C
with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, the QDs were precipitated
from chloroform with acetonitrile and centrifuged to form a pellet.
The pellet was dissolved in chloroform and filtered through a 0.45
μm hydrophobic membrane filter (Millipore).

4.9 QD Thiol–yne Nanocomposite Fabrication
As previously
described,17−19 to form the native thiol–yne
prepolymer, 1 mol equivalent of ODY and 1 mol equivalent of PETMP
were added to a small glass vial and mixed by agitation (Scheme 3). In a separate
glass vial, a 1.5 μM solution of functionalized QDs was made
in chloroform. The thiol–yne solution was then added to the
vial containing the dissolved QDs, and the vial containing both components
was capped and its contents were mixed by vigorous agitation (∼5
s) to form a single-phase solution (Scheme 3). The uncapped vial was then heated (∼80
°C) on a hot plate to evaporate off the chloroform solvent. Upon
solvent evaporation, the QD thiol–yne nanocomposite prepolymer
can be thermally cured at 80 °C (∼30 min) to form the
final QD thiol–yne nanocomposite. As an alternative to thermal
curing, 0.5 mol % DMPA photoinitiator can be added to the prepolymer,
and the prepolymer cured for ∼10 s underneath a lamp emitting
UV energy at 365 nm to yield the QD thiol–yne nanocomposite.
Bulk thiol–yne polymers having both native thiol–yne
polymer and QD thiol–yne nanocomposite regions (Figure 1) were made by sequentially
photopolymerizing both QD thiol–yne and native thiol–yne
prepolymers within a custom mold (Figure S1).

4.10 PL Analysis
PL spectra were collected
on a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrophotometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison,
NJ, USA) equipped with a red-sensitive R2658 Hamamatsu photomultiplier
detector and a 400 nm long-pass filter. QDs in the thiol–yne
polymers and in chloroform solutions (Spectrosil Quartz cuvette, Starna
Cells) were excited at 300 nm.

4.11 TEM
Analysis
Structural characterization
of as-prepared NPs was carried out using a JEOL JEM-2100 FE-TEM, field-emission
gun transmission electron microscope, providing high-spatial-resolution
atomic imaging and microstructure analysis of material samples. Samples
for TEM were prepared by spreading a drop (5–10 μL) of
the filtered NP dispersion (filtered using 0.25 μm Millipore
syringe filters) onto an ultrathin carbon/holey support film on a
300 mesh Au grid (Ted Pella, Inc.) and letting it dry. The concentration
of NPs in the DI water used was typically ∼1 μM. Individual
particle sizes were measured using a Gatan DigitalMicrograph (Pleasanton,
CA); average sizes along with standard deviations were extracted from
the analysis of ∼100 NPs.

4.12 Differential
Scanning Calorimetry Analysis
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was performed on a Netzsch
STA 449 Jupiter F1 system. The reference/control material used for
this analysis was an empty aluminum DSC cup, and helium was flowed
at 30 mL/min over the sealed cups. The temperature was cycled from
−40 to 125 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The glass-transition
temperatures (Tg) are given in Table 1.

4.13 Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis was performed on TA Instruments 2960 SDT. The samples were
heated from room temperature to 450 °C at 10 °C/min under
a nitrogen gas purge. The degradation temperature values given in Table 1 represent the temperature
at which 90% of the sample remained.

4.14 Refractive
Index Determination
Refractive
indices were measured using a Metricon 2010/M Prism Coupler refractometer,
which is capable of yielding five decimal place accuracy when coupled
to laser sources with high-beam qualities. Laser sources were at 635.4,
983.3, and 1549.6 nm. The instrument utilized a standard Rutile prism
whose index was calibrated at each respective wavelength using a reference
Hi-Index glass provided by Metricon. The recorded index values were
averaged over five instrument scans.
