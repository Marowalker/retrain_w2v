The
effect of chemical modification of mesoporous TiO2 electrodes
by 2-(4-butoxyphenyl)-N-hydroxyacetamide
(BPHA) before dye adsorption is investigated in dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSCs). Two organic dyes, LEG4 and Dyenamo blue, were used in
combination with the cobalt (II/III) tris(bipyridine) redox couple.
The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs is clearly enhanced by BPHA.
Preadsorption of mesoporous TiO2 electrodes with BPHA lowered
the amount of adsorbed dye but improved the short-circuit current
densities and the power conversion efficiencies by 10–20%,
while keeping the open-circuit potential essentially unaffected. Notably,
BPHA improved the LEG4 performance, whereas it has been reported for
this dye that chenodeoxycholic acid as a coadsorbent lowers solar
cell efficiency. Faster dye regeneration was found to be one reason
for improved performance, but improved electron injection efficiency
may also contribute to the favorable effect of BPHA.

Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have
attracted much scientific
attention after the breakthrough report in 1991 by O’Regan
and Grätzel, who described the first efficient DSCs with efficiencies
exceeding 7% in simulated sunlight.1 They
used a ruthenium complex as the sensitizer, which was attached to
a mesoporous TiO2 electrode, and a redox-based electrolyte
based on iodide/triiodide. Most of the following work on DSCs worldwide
was carried out on similar systems, which eventually reached a record
efficiency of 12%.2 In 2010, Feldt et al.
demonstrated a way toward higher efficiencies in DSCs, by switching
to organic dyes as sensitizers and to cobalt-based complexes as redox
mediators.3 By using a one-electron redox
mediator, much lower overpotential losses compared with iodide/triiodide
are obtained, and by implementing organic dyes with suitable peripheral
groups, electron recombination to the redox mediator, a serious problem
for DSCs with one-electron mediators, is slowed down. This work was
followed up by research focusing on novel dyes,4−8 on the stability of the cobalt electrolyte,9,10 and on counter electrodes suitable for this redox mediator.11,12 After tedious optimization, a record efficiency of 14% has recently
been reported for a DSC cosensitized by two organic dyes (LEG4 and
ADEKA-1) and using a cobalt phenanthroline-based electrolyte.13

To suppress unwanted recombination reactions
in DSCs, several electrode
treatments and additives to the electrolyte are applied.2 Coadsorbents are frequently added in the dye
bath to improve the performance of the solar cells. Cholic acid derivatives
are used to suppress dye aggregation.14−18 Long alkyl chain acids such as 1-decylphosphonic
acid are used to suppress dark current and to improve solar cell stability.19 ω-Guanidinoalkyl acids have been found
to shift the TiO2 conduction band to a higher energy and
to slow down electron recombination to the electrolyte.20 Han et al. used small donor–acceptor-type
coadsorbents, which absorb blue light and prevent aggregation of the
ruthenium black dye, and achieved a certified record for DSCs (11.4%).21 Similarly, Song et al. developed a triarylamine-based
coadsorbent that prevented π–π stacking of organic
dye molecules (NKX2677) and contributed to the light-harvesting effect
at short wavelengths.22

In this work,
the effect of molecular modification of the mesoporous
TiO2 electrode by 2-(4-butoxyphenyl)-N-hydroxyacetamide (BPHA, see Figure 1) is investigated in DSCs with a cobalt-complex-based
electrolyte. The binding group in BPHA is hydroxamic acid, which has
recently been successfully used in sensitizers for DSCs.23,24 The best performance was obtained by adsorbing BPHA onto the mesoporous
TiO2 electrode before dye-sensitization by the two dyes
investigated here, LEG47,8 and Dyenamo blue (DB).25 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the
two different organic dyes with a D−π–A structure,
LEG4 and DB, was improved by a full percent unit in both cases. The
underlying mechanism is investigated here.

Experimental Section
Materials and Experimental Methods
The organic sensitizers
and redox couples were purchased from Dyenamo AB (Sweden) and the
other chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich. BPHA was available from a previous
study.

Device Preparation
Fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrates
(TEC 15, Pilkington) were pretreated in a 40 mM TiCl4 solution
at 70 °C for 30 min. TiO2 films with an active area
of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were then screen-printed using TiO2 paste (Dyesol DSL 30NRD-T) with a 120T screen. The thicknesses
of the films were measured using a profilometer (Veeco Dektak 3).
Two light scattering layers with a thickness of approximately 3 μm
for each layer were printed on the top of an approximately 4 μm
mesoporous transparent TiO2 layer. After printing each
layer, the films were dried at 120 °C for 5 min in an oven. Then,
the TiO2 substrates were sintered in an air atmosphere
to get the optimized crystallinity in the same oven using a temperature-gradient
program, with four steps at 180 °C for 10 min, 320 °C for
10 min, 390 °C for 10 min, and 500 °C for 60 min. The films
were kept overnight inside of the oven for cooling. Thereafter, the
electrode films were subjected to another TiCl4 treatment,
followed by another heating cycle. After cooling to 90 °C, the
electrodes were immersed in a 1 mM BPHA solution in ethanol for 1
h, followed by rinsing with ethanol and drying in air. Then, the samples
were left overnight in the dye baths, containing either 0.2 mM LEG4
in ethanol or 0.5 mM DB in a 1:1 acetonitrile/tert-butanol mixture, followed by rinsing with the solvent. Counter electrodes
were prepared by electropolymerization of PEDOT onto TEC8 conducting
glass.11 Solar cells were assembled using
a 30 μm thick thermoplastic frame (Surlyn) in a hot press (HeptaChroma).
The electrolyte solution was introduced through the hole predrilled
in the counter electrode using a vacuum backfilling, and a final seal
was made using Surlyn and a thin glass plate. The electrolyte was
composed of 0.22 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, lithium perchlorate, and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine
(TBP) in acetonitrile. Silver paste was applied on the edges of the
working and counter electrodes.

Optical Characterization
Transparent mesoporous TiO2 films with a thickness of
approximately 3 μm were used
for UV–vis measurements that were recorded on an Ocean Optics
spectrophotometer (HR-2002).

Solar Cell Characterization
The
photovoltaic performance
was measured using a Keithley 2400 source/meter in combination with
a Newport Solar simulator (model 911160) under an AM1.5G illumination
(1000 W m–2) that is calibrated by using a certified
reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). A black metal mask with an
aperture of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 was placed on the top of
the solar cell and defines the active area. Incident photon-to-current
conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a computer
control setup comprising a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175),
a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), and a digital acquisition
board (Labjack U6). An in-house-made system consisting of a white
LED (Luxeon Star, 1 W), a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board
(National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier and
electromagnetic switches, was used to record voltage and current transients
following small light modulations, from which electron lifetimes and
transport time were derived.

Nanosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy
The electron
transfer kinetics were measured using a laser flash photolysis spectrometer
(Edinburgh instrument LP920) with a Nd:YAG laser/OPO system (Continuum
Surelite) tuned to 530 nm. The pulse intensity is attenuated to 0.2
mJ cm–2 per pulse by using neutral density filters.
Kinetics were recorded at 750 nm for LEG4 and 760 nm for DB.

Results
and Discussion
Effect of BPHA on Dye Coverage on Mesoporous
TiO2 and Solar Cell Performance
Figure 2 shows the UV–vis spectra
of the two
dyes, LEG4 and DB, adsorbed onto the mesoporous TiO2 films.
The DB-sensitized films are clearly darker in color than the LEG4
films. Preadsorption of BPHA onto mesoporous TiO2 has a
significant effect on the adsorption of both organic dyes. It leads
to a decrease in the absorbance, which is directly related to a decreased
amount of the adsorbed dye. For LEG4, the decrease in absorbance was
small, only 7%, but for DB, it was rather large, 27%. BPHA molecules
will bind to the mesoporous TiO2 surface through the hydroxamate
group. In the dye bath, dye molecules will have to replace BPHA molecules
upon dye sensitization, as both compete for similar binding sites
on TiO2. Our results suggest that binding of the two investigated
dyes through the cyanoacrylic acid group is significantly stronger
than binding of the hydroxyacetamide group. On the basis of the 7%
decrease in LEG4 adsorption in the presence of BPHA, it may be estimated
that the binding constant for LEG4 adsorption on TiO2 is
roughly 10 times stronger than that of BPHA. The much stronger effect
that BPHA has on the adsorption of DB may point to some aggregation
of this dye on the TiO2 surface when BPHA is absent. It
can be noted in this respect that structurally similar diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP)-based sensitizers are usually adsorbed from a dye bath containing
a large excess of cholic acid derivatives (in a 50 to 100 times larger
concentration) that can reduce dye aggregation on the surface.14,15,18

Figure 2 UV–vis spectra of LEG4 and DB absorbed
onto mesoporous TiO2, showing the effect of preadsorption
with BPHA. The TiO2 film thickness was 3 μm.

DSCs were prepared with LEG4 and
DB, with and without BPHA pretreatment
of the TiO2 electrodes. Cobalt tris(bipyridine) was used
as the redox mediator in the electrolyte. This one-electron redox
couple is highly suited for DSCs, but it requires a densely packed
dye monolayer with electron transfer blocking properties.26 Current–voltage (I–V) curves of champion devices under 1 sun illumination are
shown in Figure 3a.
The main solar cell parameters averaged for seven devices are summarized
in Table 1. For LEG4,
the open-circuit potential remains unchanged by BPHA preadsorption,
but a significant increase in short-circuit current density (JSC) by approximately 9% is found. Also, for
DB, an increased JSC is observed, by 18%
on average, but this is accompanied by a slight decrease (∼20
mV) in the open-circuit potential (VOC). Slight improvements in the fill factor (FF) are found for both
dye systems. There is a clear increase in the PCEs because of BPHA
pretreatment of the TiO2 electrode, by approximately 10
and 20% for LEG4 and DB, respectively. Here, we find that the efficiency
of LEG4 is 6.89% for standard sensitization, which increases to 7.57%
with BPHA pretreatment. In our previous work on the LEG4 dye, we found
the efficiency to be 6.5% for standard sensitization with LEG4 and
a decrease to 4.3% with sensitization in the presence of 10 mM chenodeoxycholic
acid.8 This suggests that BPHA preadsorption
may work in fundamentally different ways than coadsorption and that
it can significantly improve solar cell performance for dyes that
do not require cholic acid coadsorbers.

IPCE spectra, recorded using low-intensity
monochromatic light,
are presented in Figure 3b. The IPCE maximum of an LEG4-sensitized solar cell with BPHA is
∼90%, which is 10% higher than the solar cell without BPHA,
whereas that of DB with and without BPHA is 80 and 60%, respectively.
The improvements are consistent with the improved JSC found under solar irradiation. Considering that light
absorption is lower for the devices with BPHA pretreatment, it is
clear that their improved performance must come from more favorable
electron transfer kinetics in the solar cell. These will be investigated
in the next section.

Effect of BPHA on Electron Transfer Kinetics
in the DSCs
Several methods were used to investigate electron
transfer kinetics
in the DSCs. Complete devices were used to measure electron transport
times and lifetimes by means of photocurrent and voltage response
to small modulations in the light; see Figure 4. The electron lifetimes correspond to the
time for a recombination of electron in mesoporous TiO2, to the oxidized component in the electrolyte, Co(bpy)33+, and to the oxidized dye if dye regeneration is sluggish.
For the LEG4 dye, BPHA pretreatment has little or no effect on the
electron lifetime. By contrast, a decrease in lifetime is found for
DB with BPHA. Suppression of electron recombination by DB is not as
good as that by LEG4, and the BPHA treatment, which lowers the DB
amount by approximately 20%, further decreases the electron blocking
properties of the adsorbed dye layer. This explains the lower VOC values found for DB and BPHA–DB devices.
For DB, the BPHA pretreatment lowered the electron lifetime significantly
by a factor of ∼3. This is attributed to the less dense packing
of DB on the mesoporous TiO2 surface, which results in
poorer blocking of the electron recombination from TiO2 to Co(bpy)33+ in the electrolyte.26 Charge extraction measurements for devices with
and without BPHA did not display significant differences, suggesting
that BPHA does not significantly affect the energy levels (data not
shown). The electron transport times in the mesoporous TiO2 films were not significantly affected by the type of dye or BPHA
treatment; see Figure 4b.

Figure 4 (a) Electron lifetimes under open-circuit conditions and (b) electron
transport times under short-circuit conditions of LEG4- and DB-sensitized
DSCs with and without BPHA.

Finally, nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS)
was
used to probe the electron transfer kinetics. Specifically, the kinetics
for reduction of the oxidized dye that exists in the cell after electron
injection are probed. This reduction occurs either by the redox mediator
(Co(bpy)32+) or by electron recombination from
the TiO2. Kinetic traces of the systems in the presence
and in the absence of redox electrolyte are shown in Figure 5. Although the data are rather
noisy, it can be seen that dye regeneration is slightly improved in
films with BPHA pretreatment for both dyes. This is also apparent
from the fit parameters shown in Table 2. From the determined decay half times, in the presence
of inert electrolyte, where the kinetics reflect electron recombination
with the oxidized dye, and in the presence of redox electrolyte, where
the kinetics are from both recombination and dye regeneration, the
regeneration efficiency ϕreg is determined according
to eq 1 1  The calculated ϕreg values
show a significant trend: BPHA pretreatment leads to higher regeneration
efficiencies, by approximately 5% for LEG4 to 20% for DB. A faster
regeneration with a lower dye load on the mesoporous TiO2 surface was observed previously by Pazoki et al.26 The lower coverage of dye molecules could give better access
to the Co(II) species in the electrolyte.

devices in the presence of BPHA, (c) DB-sensitized devices, and (d)

and redox-couple-based electrolyte. The smooth lines correspond to
biexponential fits. The inert electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiClO4 and 0.2 M TBP in ACN, and the redox electrolyte was 0.22
M Co(bpy)3(PF6)2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3 (PF6)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, and
0.2 M TBP in ACN.

One aspect that was
not investigated experimentally in this study
(due to experimental limitations) is the electron injection from an
excited dye to the TiO2 conduction band. An estimation
can be made using eq 2 2  where LHE is the light-harvesting efficiency,
ϕinj is the electron injection efficiency, and ϕcc is the charge collection efficiency, assumed to be 100%
under short-circuit conditions. The latter assumption comes from the
fact that the Fermi level in the mesoporous TiO2 electrode
under short-circuit conditions is much lower in energy than that under
open-circuit conditions.27 Assuming a 100
meV difference, it is found that the electron transport time is much
smaller than the electron lifetime, and the collection efficiency
is near unity under short-circuit conditions. LHE (or absorptance)
is the fraction of the incoming light that is absorbed by the dye,
and is given by LHE = 1 −T – R, where T and R are transmittance
and reflectance, respectively. R is approximately
10% in these devices, whereas T is close to zero
at the absorption maxima of the dyes,28 so that LHE is approximately 0.90. With these assumptions, ϕinj is calculated to be unity for all devices. This simple
analysis suggests that regeneration losses are mainly responsible
for losses in IPCE and thus lowered JSC in the solar cells. Through BPHA pretreatment, regeneration of the
dyes is improved perhaps because of better accessibly of the redox
couple to the dye because there is less adsorbed dye on the mesoporous
TiO2 surface. However, because regeneration studies were
rather noisy, injection losses cannot be excluded in the DSCs. It
seems reasonable to believe that BPHA preadsorption leads to adsorption
of a more orderly dye layer, which can lead to better electron injection.

Conclusions
Molecular modification of the mesoporous TiO2 before
dye adsorption is a suitable way to improve DSC performance. In DSCs
using LEG4 and DB organic dyes as sensitizers and cobalt trisbipyridine
as the redox mediator, significant improvements in the solar cell
efficiency, by 10 to 20%, were obtained through the pretreatment of
the TiO2 electrode with BPHA. This treatment leads to a
decreased amount of adsorbed dye but to improved photocurrents and
faster dye regeneration. It is likely that the injection efficiency
is improved too. Notably, BPHA improved the performance of the popular
LEG4 dye, whereas it has been reported for this dye that chenodeoxycholic
acid as the coadsorbent lowers solar cell efficiency.

The maximum absorbance
of the lower absorbing
LEG4 dye was about 0.6 on a 3 micron film, yielding about 0.8 for
the 4 micron film. Addition of the scattering layer will approximately
double this to 1.6. This corresponds to negligible transmission losses.
