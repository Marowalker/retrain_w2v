Today, many chemical modifications are
being made to increase the utilization of chitosan and to make the
best use of it. In this study, four novel cross-linked chitosan derivatives
in the form of hydrogel (CS-L1 CS-L2, CS-L3, and CS-L4) were prepared
by the condensation of chitosan with anisole-based phenolic and nonphenolic
aromatic dicarbonyls. Structural analyses were performed by elemental
analysis (C, H, N), scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform
infrared, 13C-CP/MAS (cross-polarization, magic angle spinning)
nuclear magnetic resonance, powder X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric
analysis techniques. Metal ion uptake capacities were studied for
selected transition-metal cations in aqueous medium. The amount of
metal ions was determined by microwave plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy.
In addition, the swelling behaviors were investigated at different
temperatures (25 and 37 °C) and at different pH values (3, 7,
and 10). The order of the selectivity of cross-linked chitosan derivatives
toward metal ions was found to be Cu(II) > Cd(II) > Fe(II) >
Co(II) > Ni(II). The results showed that the derivatives exhibited
the property of hydrogel and suggest that they could be applied in
many areas such as metal removing, water removing, and biological
applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cross-linked polymers with the
ability to swell by holding more solvent than 20% of their mass are
termed xerogel. When the solvent is water, these cross-linked structures
take the name of hydrogel.1 Hydrogels are
physically or chemically cross-linked hydrophilic polymer matrixes
that swell by absorbing large amounts of water (or biological fluids)
but do not dissolve (in the short term) in water.2,3

Among the biopolymers, chitosan is one of the most abundant on earth,
thus having great potential in hydrogel preparation.4 A lot of novel chitosan hydrogels have been obtained by
cross-linking over hydroxyl and amino groups of chitosan.5 Chitosan biopolymer is an amino polysaccharide
which is biocompatible, biodegradable, nontoxic, and also antimicrobial.
It is open to chemical and mechanical modification in order to gain
new features and functions.6 Today, many
new cross-linkers are synthesized and new cross-linked chitosan derivatives
are prepared to improve these properties of chitosan.

Biopolymer-based
hydrogels have a wide range of applications in the food, pharmaceutical,
and biomedical industries because of their biocompatibility and biodegradability.7 Because of the ability of the hydrogels to swell
by holding water in the aqueous medium, they are used in adsorption
areas such as manufacturing hygiene products,8 contact lenses, wound dressings,7 tissue
engineering,9 water purification, heavy
metal removal,10 controlled drug release,11 agricultural,12 ion-exchange
applications, chromatographic applications, solvent extraction, removal
of water from industrial wastes containing petroleum and oil, and
prevention of corrosion.13

Derivatization
of chitosan can increase the complexation capacity of chitosan with
metals, which enhances the adsorption properties of chitosan.14 In this sense, Schiff base-chitosan derivatives
can be used in analytical and environmental applications as a potential
metal complex and in organic syntheses as a catalayzer.15−17

It is important to examine
swelling properties in the characterization of cross-linked polymers
that exhibit swelling behavior. For this purpose, it must first be
created in the swelling curves. Swelling curves are formed by monitoring
changes in the mass or volume of the polymer containing the appropriate
solvent over time.18

In this study,
it was aimed to synthesize chitosan derivatives in the form of hydrogel,
which are insoluble in water, can retain more metal, and have phenolic
group for biological applications. For this purpose, four cross-linked
chitosan derivatives were synthesized by using aromatic dialdehyde
and diketones as the cross-linking agent. Derivatives were characterized
by spectroscopic methods. In addition, metal ions uptake capacities
and swelling behaviors of cross-linked chitosan derivatives were investigated.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Chitosan
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with a molecular weight of 310–375
kDa (high molecular weight) and 75% degree of deacetylation. Salicylaldehyde,
acetophenone, 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone, diethyl amine, 1,2-dibromoethane,
and acetic acid were purchased from Merck. 2,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde
was purchased from Roth. Stock solutions of Cu(CH3COO)2·1H2O, Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O, NiCl2·6H2O, Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O, and FeSO4·7H2O were prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of metal(II)
salt (analytical grade) in deionized water. All solvents were of reagent-grade
quality, and they were obtained from commercial suppliers and were
purified before use by a well-known distillation method.

Melting
points were recorded on Electrothermal IA9200. Elemental analyses
of the compounds for C, H, and N were carried out with LECO-CHNS-932.
The samples were analyzed with a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer
PerkinElmer spectrum two, equipped with a diamond-tipped attenuated
total reflection (ATR) accessory. The analysis region ranged from
400 to 4000 cm–1. 13C NMR spectra were
obtained by a Bruker Superconducting FT/NMR Spectrometer Avance TM
300 MHz WB with CP/MAS technique (cross-polarization, magic angle
spinning). The cell was cleaned three times with acetone after each
spectrum was acquired. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the samples
were performed with a Mettler Toledo thermal analyzer under nitrogen
atmosphere and heated from 20 to 800 °C at a heating rate of
10 °C min–1. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of samples were recorded at room temperature on a Rigaku System RadB
X-ray diffractometer, using monochromated Cu Kα radiation in
the range 2°–40° (2θ), at 25 °C. Morphological
analysis of images obtained was carried out by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), JEOL 5500. Metal analysis was carried out by microwave plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy (MP-AES): Agilent 4100 in a solution prepared
by decomposition of the complex with HNO3 followed by dilution
with distilled water.

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Dialdehydes and Diketones (L1–L4)
Dialdehydes and diketones exist in the literature, and they (L1–L4)
were synthesized according to the literature.19 The proposed structures of dialdehyde and diketone are given in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Synthesis route of dialdehydes
and diketones.

To a round-bottom
flask, the corresponding phenol derivative (12 mmol) was added in
acetone (20 mL) followed by anhydrous K2CO3 (20
mmol, 2.78 g), and the flask was dipped into a preheated oil bath
(80 °C) and stirred at 80 °C for 15 min. After 15 min, the
temperature of the oil bath was raised to 110 °C. Then, to the
hot reaction mixture, 1,2-dibromoethane (5 mmol) was added in one
portion. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C
for 12 h, and after this period, the flask was allowed to cool to
room temperature. Next, the reaction mixture was poured onto crushed
ice (50–75 g). Finally, the solid compound (dicarbonyl) that
formed was filtered through a filtration funnel and was purified by
rapid column chromatography followed by crystallization from CHCl3–petroleum ether. The prepared compounds were characterized
by their melting points and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR–ATR)
spectra.19

2.2.2 Synthesis of Cross-Linked
Chitosan Derivative (CS-L1)
Chitosan derivatives were prepared
according to the literature.23 Chitosan
(1.0 g) was stirred in a 100 mL 1% acetic acid solution at 60 °C
for 1 h to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To the resulting chitosan
solution, 50 mL of ethanolic solution of L1 (1.57 g, 5.83 mmol) was
added and stirred under reflux for 12 h. Then, the mixture was cooled
to room temperature, and at the end, a precipitate was obtained in
the form of gel by adding 1 M NaHCO3. The gel was filtered
and dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C. The prepared gel was purified
with Soxhlet extraction by using ethanol as the solvent.

The
synthetic route is shown in Figure 2. The formation of imine bond (C=N) as a result
of the reaction of amine group (from chitosan) with the carbonyl group
(from aldehyde) was given the resultant desired cross-linked product
CS-L1.

Figure 2 Synthesis of cross-linked chitosan derivative
(CS-L1).

The cross-linked chitosan derivatives were synthesized
according to the same procedure of CS-L1 by using 1.73 g L2, 1.76
g L3, and 1.92 g L4. The prepared cross-linked chitosan derivatives
were coded as CS-L2 (Figure S1), CS-L3
(Figure S2), and CS-L4 (Figure S3), respectively.

2.2.3 Metal Ion Uptake Studies
At acidic pH
(3.5–5.5), the complex formation between the metal ion and
the chitosan derivative reduces as the free-amine groups of the chitosan
are protonated. Amino groups are present as free amines at pH 6.5–7.0
and the metal retention capacity of the chitosan derivative increases.24 A series of transparent and stable hydrogels
is obtained by mixing chitosan with various metal ions at appropriate
pH values.25

The metal ion uptake
studies were performed, at 25 ± 0.1 °C in pH 6 buffered
medium on an orbital shaker for 3 h, by shaking 50 mg of the derivative
in 50 mL of 100 ppm Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), and Fe(II) solutions
(metal/derivative ratios were prepared as 100 mg metal/1 g derivative).
The pH of the solution was adjusted using acetic acid/sodium acetate
for pH 6.26 After that, the suspension
was filtered and diluted (1:20), and the amounts of metal ions remaining
in the solution were determined by MP-AES.

The metal ion uptake
capacities of chitosan derivatives in mg/g are calculated by the following eq 1 1  where C is the metal holding capacity
in mg/g, the amount of metal retained as Wa (mg), and Wp is the mass of the derivative
in grams.

2.2.4 Swelling
Studies
The swelling experiments of the cross-linked chitosan
derivatives were carried out in the water medium at 25 and 37 °C
and pH 3.0, 7.0, and 10.0. NaOH (0.1 M) and 0.1 M HCl were used to
adjust the pH solutions. The samples were weighed at a sensitivity
of 0.1 mg and placed in an aqueous environment sensitive to ±0.1
°C. When
the derivative was left in the solution, t = 0 was
taken and it removed from the water at certain time intervals were
dried and weighed. After 180 min, the experiment was terminated because
of the swelling slowed.

Swelling % (S %) is
calculated by the following eq 2 2  where S %, Wt, and Wo are the percent of swelling, weight at different times, and
initial weight of the sample, respectively.27

2.2.5 Swelling Kinetics
Studies
For extensive swelling of polymers, the following
second-order kinetics relation can be used28 3  where t is time, S is swelling
at t, B = 1/Smax is the inverse of the maximum or equilibrium swelling, A = 1/kS Smax2 is
the reciprocal of the initial swelling rate [(dS/dt)0] of the hydrogel, and kS is swelling rate constant.

The linear regressions of the swelling
curves were obtained by means of eq 3 for the hydrogels in water at different temperatures
and pH.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Solubility
It is well-known that chitosan is insoluble in
water, organic solvents, and aqueous bases, and it is soluble after
stirring in acids such as acetic, nitric, hydrochloric, perchloric,
and phosphoric.29

As a result of
the derivatization of chitosan from amine groups, it is expected that
the solubility of chitosan derivatives in comparison to chitosan will
decrease because of the decrease of free-amine groups. As a result,
it has been observed that cross-linked chitosan derivatives are not
soluble in aqueous acid or basic solutions, but depending on the cross-linking
ratio, low cross-linked CS-L2 and CS-L4 derivatives are dispersed
in these solutions in time.

3.2 Elemental Analyses
The C, H, and N elemental analysis
results and C/N ratio values of the prepared cross-linked chitosan
derivatives are given in Table 1.

a DS: degree of substitution; a: the number of nitrogen; n: the number
of carbon.

The elemental analysis results of the synthesized
chitosan derivatives showed an increase in the C % and H % values
and a decrease in the N % values due to the dicarbonyl compound (which
does not contain nitrogen atoms) entering the reaction. These changes
were more easily detected by calculating C/N ratios. When the C/N
ratios are examined, it is seen that the C/N ratios of synthesized
cross-linked chitosan derivatives are higher than those of chitosan.
These results are considered to be important evidence showing that
new chitosan derivatives have been obtained.

The number of carbonyl
attached to each NH2 group in the chitosan was calculated
as the degree of substitution (DS) by the following eq 4:30 4  (C/N)m is the modified
chitosan C/N ratio, (C/N)o is the initial chitosan C/N
ratio, and “a” and “n” are the number of nitrogen and carbon contained
after the chitosan has been modified, respectively. The DS of chitosan
derivatives is given in Table 1. Because the activity of aldehyde in Schiff base formation
is higher than that of ketones, maximum substitution was observed
in the aldehyde derivatives. The cross-linking sequence is obtained
as CS-L3 > CS-L1 > CS-L4 > CS-L2.

3.3 FT-IR Spectra
In order to characterize
the hydrogels, a spectrum of pure chitosan was also recorded. The
main bands appearing in the IR spectra of chitosan spectrum, vibrations
of OH groups in the region of 3500–3000 cm–1, which are overlapped to the stretching vibration of N–H,
the vibrations of carbonyl bonds (C=O) of the amide group in
the range of 1680–1480 cm–1, vibrations of
etheric CO in the range from 1160 to 1000 cm–1,
and the bands near 1080–1025 cm–1 are attributed
to etheric CO of the ring, and the peak at ∼890 cm–1 corresponding to wagging of the saccharide structure of chitosan
appears.31

Comparing the spectrum
of chitosan (CS) with the spectra of hydrogels, we can observe that
they differ from each other. In the spectra of chitosan derivatives,
some bands although broadened and shifted, some new bands were observed
at the range of 1300–1600 cm–1 (Figure S4). These new bands can be attributed
to the vibrational modes of C=N, C=C, and C–H
groups of the Schiff base moities.32

In the IR spectra of hydrogels, the NH stretching vibrations of chitosan
disappeared and −OH stretching vibrations were observed as
a broad band in the range from 3000 to 3600 cm–1, and the 1651 cm–1 band shifted to 1663 cm–1 (CS-L1), 1663 cm–1 (CS-L2), 1691
cm–1 (CS-L3), and 1660 cm–1 (CS-L4),
which can be attributed to the C=N of Schiff base, respectively.
In addition, for CS-L1 and CS-L2, the disubstitute benzene peak was
observed at 753 and 756 cm–1, whereas the trisubstitue
benzene peak for CS-L3 and CS-L4 was observed at 801 and 804 cm–1, respectively (Figure 3).

Figure 3 FT-IR
spectra of chitosan and derivatives.

3.4 13C CP-MAS Solid-State NMR Analysis
In previous
studies,
chitosan with a degree of acetylation of 75% was given 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR chemical shift values at 23 ppm (−CH3),
58 ppm (C2), 61 ppm (C6), 76 ppm (C5, C3), 85 ppm (C4), 106 ppm (C1),
and 174 ppm (C=O), respectively.33 As compared with chitosan, new peaks were observed from 110 to 140
ppm (aromatic carbons), 70 ppm (C-10; overlapped signal with chitosan
C3, C4, C5 carbons), 163 ppm (C-9; benzene carbon adjacent to etheric
oxygen atom), 166 ppm (C-8; azomethine carbon), and 180 ppm (free
carbonyl carbon) in the spectrum of derivatives. The formation of
new peaks confirms the formation of the cross-linked chitosan derivatives
(Figures 4, 5, S5, and S6).

Figure 4 13C CP-MAS
NMR spectrum of CS-L1.

Figure 5 13C CP-MAS
NMR spectrum of CS-L4.

13C NMR can be used as a quantitative tool.34 The intensity of the new peaks varied in direct
proportion with cross-linking. As the cross-linking decreases, the
peak intensity was decreased. Elemental
analysis results showed that cross-linking in CS-L2 and CS-L4 was
less than in CS-L1 and CS-L3, and also in the C NMR spectra, the peak
intensity of CS-L2 and CS-L4 was observed to be lower than that of
CS-L1 and CS-L3. When the 13C NMR peak intensities of the
derivatives are considered, the peak intensities of C NMR are in agreement
with the results of elemental analysis.

3.5 Morphology
One of the most commonly
used methods for understanding the surface properties and porosity
of polymeric samples is the SEM method.35

The difference in structural morphology between chitosan and
CS-L1, CS-L2, CS-L3, and CS-L4 is also supported by the difference
in SEM images. SEM results show that derivatives different from chitosan
were synthesized. SEM images of chitosan and chitosan derivatives
are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Scanning
electron micrographs of chitosan (a), CS-L1 (b), CS-L2 (c), CS-L3
(d), and CS-L4 (e).

Chitosan derivatives exhibit a wider three-dimensional rough
structure compared to the smooth surface of chitosan.36

3.6 XRD (Powder
XRD) Analysis
It was previously reported that CS exhibits
two sharp crystalline peaks at 2θ = 10° and 2θ =
20°, which attributed to intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen
bonds of chitosan, respectively.16,37 It is known
that the intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bondings formed
between amino group and a hydroxyl group stabilize the crystalline
structure of chitosan.

Crystallinity decreases by the deformation
of some intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds because of
both the decreasing free-amino group and formation of steric hindrance
after cross-linking.38−40 Chitosan
derivatives with amorphous structure can be used in biomedical applications.36

In the XRD pattern of derivatives, the
intensity of peaks decreased and broadening of the peaks was observed
when compared with the free chitosan. These results suggest that the
derivatives have a less crystalline and more amorphous structure than
the pure chitosan (Figure S7).

According
to XRD results, the peak intensity of the dialdehyde derivatives CS-L1
and CS-L3 was decreased more and the peaks were broadened more when
compared with the diketone derivatives CS-L2 and CS-L4. The more deformation
in the crystal structure has shown that more cross-linking takes place
in the chitosan polymer.

3.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The thermal properties of
the derivatives were investigated by TGA techniques under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Chitosan exhibits a one-step degradation reaction in the
nitrogen environment. TGA thermograms of derivatives are shown in Figure S8.

It is well-known that chitosan
has two mass loss stages: water elimination and decomposition. These
stages are observed at 40–100 °C range and 280–400
°C range, respectively.41 Degradation
of Schiff bases occurs at 300–400 °C, and evaporation
of the phenolic group occurs above 400 °C.42 The degradation values of chitosan derivatives were given
in Table 2.

Table 2 Degradation Temperature of Derivatives
 	1. degradation
range (°C) (weight loss %)	2. degradation range (°C) (weight loss %)	2. degradation
temperature (°C)	carbon residue % (at 600 °C)	
chitosan	50–150(∼10)	150–600(∼59)	319	30, 99	
CS-L1	75–156(∼15)	236–600(∼44)	291	40, 79	
CS-L2	50–250(∼10)	259–600(∼53)	301	37, 15	
CS-L3	50–225(∼11)	225–400(∼36)	264	44, 59	
 	 	400–600(∼9)	468	 	
CS-L4	50–225(∼5)	225–400(∼38)	284	43, 51	
 	 	400–600(∼13)	479	 	
Weight
loss in the range of 50–200 °C observed by means of the
loss of water. In addition to the loss of water, derivatives also
display other significant weight losses in the region 250–350
°C, attributable to the decomposition of Schiff base and chitosan
chains. On the other hand, for CS-L3 and CS-L4, another weight loss
was observed at 450–600 °C range, which attributed to
the evaporation of phenolic OH.

When
the results of CS-L compared with the results of the chitosan in terms
of the thermal behaviors, there are many important differences and
can be observed due to the interaction between chitosan and dicarbonyls.

As a result, all derivatives exhibited lower final degradation
temperature than chitosan due to the derivatization. According to
the results, chitosan derivatives are less thermally stable than chitosan.
This instability can be attributable to deterioration of the crystallinity
of chitosan by Schiff base formation.32

3.8 Metal Ion Uptake
Results
According to the MP-AES analysis, the amount of uptake
Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), and Fe(II) for per gram derivative
was given in Table 3.

Table 3 Amount of Metal Held by Derivatives
 	Cu(II)	Cd(II)	Fe(II)	Co(II)	Ni(II)	
 	mg/g	ppm	mg/g	ppm	mg/g	ppm	mg/g	ppm	mg/g	ppm	
CS-L1	84.0	84 000	83.8	83 800	80.6	80 600	78.4	78 400	78.0	78 000	
CS-L2	71.8	71 800	57.2	57 200	56.0	56 000	39.0	39 000	20.2	20 200	
CS-L3	59.6	59 600	49.4	49 400	59.2	59 200	29.8	29 800	9.2	9200	
CS-L4	64.0	64 000	60.8	60 800	59.8	59 800	33.6	33 600	12.2	12 200	
The capacities of hydrogels for Cu(II) ions were found as
CS-L1 (84.0 mg g–1), CS-L2 (71.8 mg g–1), CS-L3 (59.6 mg g–1), and CS-L4 (64.0 mg g–1). All hydrogels exhibited a higher uptake capacity
for Cu(II) ions than the other metal ions used in the study. According
to obtained data, metal uptake capacity of the hydrogels was found
as CS-L1 > CS-L2 > CS-L4 > CS-L3. As a result, hydrogels
showed selectivity toward Cu(II), Fe(II), and Cd(II) ions.

The
cross-linking sequence was in the form of CS-L3 > CS-L1 > CS-L4
> CS-L2, whereas the metal capture sequence was CS-L1 > CS-L2
> CS-L4 > CS-L3, depending on the cross-linking ratio and bonding
geometry.

The degree of swelling of hydrogel decreases, as the
cross-linking increases and the structure becomes tighter. In this
case, the hydrogel is less swollen, most of the metal ions are not
infiltrated into the inner part of the hydrogel, and metal uptake
happens only on the surface of the hydrogels.43 In previous studies, the Cu(II) metal uptake capacity of glutaraldehyde
cross-linked epoxyaminated chitosan as 51.75 mg/g44 and glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan nanofibers as
72 mg/g45 had been found. The metal retention
capacity of the synthesized derivatives was found to be higher than
or close to these values.

3.9 Swelling Behaviors
3.9.1 Percent Swelling
At equilibrium, hydrogel has the greatest
swelling value. With the help of the obtained data, swelling kinetics
of network polymers can be determined by calculating values such as
equilibrium percent swelling, initial swelling rate, swelling rate
constant, and theoretical equilibrium percent swelling.46

Percent swelling rate (S %) was calculated according to eq 2. The values of percent swelling of hydrogels are given

In chitosan films, as the cross-linker concentration increased,
the water retention capacity and the release of active substances
from the film decrease.47

The degree
of swelling varies with the pH for all hydrogels. Partial acid and
basic hydrolysis affected the swelling behavior of the derivatives.
Swelling of hydrogels occurs by hydrogen bond formation. As the hydrophilic
groups increase, the hydrogen bond formation increases. The OH groups
present in the synthesized hydrogels and the free NH2 groups
remaining unreacted perform the swelling process by hydrogen bonding
with water. In the acidic environment, as these functional groups
are protonated, less hydrogen bonding and less swelling occurs compared
to the basic environment.

We have found that the swelling behavior
of hydrogels strongly depends on the pH and the degree of its swelling
increases with the increase of pH.

The highest swelling value
was observed in CS-L1 because of its porous structure. Water retention
generally occurred in neutral and basic medium.

As the temperature
increases, the water retention rate is lower than the low temperature
because of increased solubility in the hydrogel.

3.9.2 Equilibrium Water Content
In cross-linked polymers, after a certain time after having been
exposed to the solvent environment, the rate at which the solvent
enters and leaves the structure becomes equal and the balance is reached.
At this point, hydrogel has the greatest swelling value.

For
hydrogels in equilibrium with solvent, the equilibrium water content
(EWC) is calculated by eq 5(48) 5  

In the equation, We is the equilibrium
(swollen) polymer mass and Wo shows the
mass of dry polymer.

The equilibrium liquid content is a parameter
which is calculated for the hydrogel in this case and is very important
for biocompatibility. For hydrogels, EWC values greater than 0.60
are indicative of potential biocompatibility. The EWC values were
given in Table 5.

Table 5 EWC Values
of Derivatives
 	pH

CS-L1	0.81	0.72	0.77	0.79	0.74	0.81	
CS-L2	0.26	0.28	0.24	0.48	0.52	0.68	
CS-L3	0.22	0.68	0.69	0.22	0.62	0.67	
CS-L4	0.51	0.60	0.62	0.46	0.60	0.57	
Most of the derivatives were found to have an EWC value greater than
0.60 at different pH ranges and temperatures. According to these results,
all derivatives exhibited hydrogel properties.

3.9.3 Swelling Kinetics Studies
The initial swelling rate, the swelling rate constant, and the
values of theoretical equilibrium swelling of the hydrogel were calculated
from the slope and the intersection of the lines, respectively. The
results are presented in Table 6 (Figures S17–S40, see the Supporting Information)

4 Conclusions
In this work, new cross-linked chitosan
hydrogels were synthesized by the formation of Schiff base. Elemental
analysis (C, H, N), SEM, FT-IR, 13C-CP/MAS NMR, powder
XRD, and TGA technique data support that the chitosan is cross-linked.

When swelling rates are taken into account, cross-linking was more
often observed in dialdehyde cross-linked chitosan derivatives. Also,
this is supported by the DS, 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR,
and XRD analysis. Increasing the degree of cross-linking of the system
will result in a stronger gel, and a higher degree of cross-linking
creates a more brittle structure.

In the swelling experiments,
the experimental results and the theoretical data are in agreement
with one another. Although hydrogels generally swelled faster at 37
°C, less swelling was observed with increasing temperature because
of increased solubility. For all derivatives, the highest initial
swelling rate was found at pH 10 for both 25 and 37 °C.

EWC values of some hydrogels are close to the percent water content
values of the body, 0.60 (or 60%). Accordingly, most hydrogels exhibit
liquid contents similar to living tissues.49

Generally, the metal uptake order is Cu(II) > Fe(II) >
Cd(II) > Co(II) > Ni(II). As a result of this study, besides
being the most Cu(II), it can be said that all derivatives showed
selectivity toward Cu(II), Fe(II), and Cd(II) ions.

Although
maximal cross-linking is observed in CS-L1 and CS-L3, maximum metal
retention and swelling were found in CS-L1 because of its porous structure
(Figure 6). A result
of high swelling of CS-L1 facilitates diffusion of metal ions to the
CS-L1 interior. The least metal retention is found in CS-L3 because
CS-L3 is highly cross-linked and its structure is more rigid.
