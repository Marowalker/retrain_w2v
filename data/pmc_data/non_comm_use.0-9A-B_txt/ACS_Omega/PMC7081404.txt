Iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) is a versatile
material that is utilized as an inhibitor of flame, shows
soot suppressibility, and is used as a precursor for focused electron-beam-induced
deposition (FEBID). X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) of
the K edge, which is a powerful technique for monitoring the oxidation
states and coordination environment of metal sites, can be used to
gain insight into Fe(CO)5-related reaction mechanisms in
in situ experiments. We use a finite difference method (FDM) and molecular-orbital-based
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to clarify
the Fe K-edge XANES features
of Fe(CO)5. The two pre-edge peaks P1 and P2 are mainly the Fe(1s) → Fe–C(σ*) and
Fe(1s) → Fe–C(π*) transitions, respectively. When the geometry transformed from D3h to C4v symmetry, a ∼30% decrease of the
pre-edge P2 intensity was observed in the simulated spectra.
This implies that the π bonding of Fe and CO is sensitive to
changes in geometry. The following rising edge and white line regions
are assigned to the Fe(1s) → Fe(4p)(mixing C(2p)) transitions.
Our results may provide useful information to interpret XANES spectra
variations of in situ reactions of metal–CO or similar compounds
with π acceptor ligandlike metal–CN complexes.

1 Introduction
Carbon
monoxide (CO) is one of the important ligands that can be
a σ donor or a π acceptor in metal–carbonyl complexes
so as to own some special characters in chemical bonding, like strong
field ligand,1 semibridging ligand,2 and cis effect.3 It
plays an important role in organometallic synthesis, catalysis, biological
processes, and materials chemistry.4−9 For example, iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5) has various
applications such as flame inhibition, soot suppressibility,10−14 and as a precursor for focused electron-beam-induced
deposition (FEBID).15−17 In general, the trigonal bipyramid geometry (D3h symmetry) is the most common
structure for gas18−21 and solid phases of Fe(CO)522,23 and the square pyramid geometry (C4v symmetry) is a transition state of Berry pseudorotation.24,25 However, the C4v and C2v structures may be stabilized
by interactions with a solvent molecule located at the trans to rotational
axis of a CO ligand.26−29 In general, infrared spectroscopy is often used to characterize
metal–carbonyl complexes. Besides, X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) is another technique to characterize the change of metal sites
in such metal–carbonyl complexes due to the element-specific
character of XAS. For example, Fe K-edge XAS is utilized to solve
the local structure of Fe(CO)5 in a solution state and
the C2v structure is
obtained in a benzene solvent.28

Generally, the metal K-edge X-ray absorption spectrum is divided
into two regimes: X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). The range up to
50–1000 eV above the absorption edge is the EXAFS regime, which
is a single-scattering-dominated region. It can provide coordination
numbers and distances between absorbing atom and surrounding atoms
within 5 Å.30 The range above the
rising edge up to 40 eV including the pre-edge peaks is named XANES.
In the XANES regime, the spectrum features are dominated by the contributions
of multiple scattering events with many atoms, which is a measurement
of high-order atomic correlation functions. Therefore, this spectral
region can be also utilized to obtain local structures through XANES
fitting. However, to the best of our best knowledge, currently, only
XMAN31,32 and FitIt33,34 software can
achieve XANES fitting. In addition, the pre-edge peaks are attributed
to the excitation of core electrons into the unoccupied molecular
orbitals (MOs), which can be used to investigate molecular symmetry
and metal coordination. Due to these characteristics of XANES, it
can even be applied to monitor the variations of the local structure
in absorbing atoms during the reaction process. Therefore, Ahr et
al. combined picosecond Fe K-edge XAS experiments and theoretical
XANES spectra to study the ligand substitution dynamics of Fe(CO)5 in ethanol.35 The region in front
of and behind the white line is divided into three ranges of 7121–7125
eV (measurement 1), 7127–7129 eV (measurement 2), and 7131–7133
eV (measurement 3), and these ranges are monitored during a substitution
reaction. The results indicate that measurement 3 is sensitive to
the reaction process that is occurring and subsequently observed in
measurement 1. In combination with the simulated XANES of Fe(CO)5 and Fe(CO)4EtOH by the FEFF program, where FEFF
is an automated program for ab initio calculations of XAS for clusters
of atoms based on the multiple scattering theory (MST), the variations
of measurements 1 and 3 are interpreted as the excitation of Fe(CO)5 and the formation of Fe(CO)4EtOH, respectively.35 However, there is no discussion in the pre-edge
region that is below 7120 eV.

In fact, the resolution of metal
K-edge pre-edge features is also
important. For instance, carbonmonoxy-myoglobin was investigated by
polarized X-ray absorption spectra and it was concluded that the observed
two pre-edge peaks were assigned to the transition of Fe(1s) to [Fe(dz2) + CO(σ)]* and [Fe(dyz,dxz) + CO(π*)]*,36,37 which interprets
the reduction of pre-edge absorption in photon-induced lysis of a
Fe–CO bond.38 To analyze the pre-edge
transition peaks of K edge XAS by theoretical calculation, the molecular
orbital (MO)-based time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)
calculations can achieve the reasonable pre-edge absorptions using
only allowed excitation out of the selected appropriate donor core
orbitals into the entire virtual space. The methodology has been applied
to analyze pre-edge features of many transition-metal complex studies,
such as Ti,39 V,40,41 Cr,42−45 Mn,45−49 Fe,50−69 Co,70,71 Ni,54,72 Cu,73−75 and Mo.76 Through the combination of the high-energy-resolution
fluorescence-detected (HERFD) XANES technique77−80 and MO-based TDDFT calculations,
more information of electronic structure can be provided from high-resolution
pre-edge of K-edge spectra.60−62 Atkins and co-workers utilize
this methodology to study Fe pre-edge spectra of Fe(CO)5 and interpret that observed first and second pre-edge peaks are
caused by Fe(1s) to unoccupied A1′ and to E″/E′
transitions, respectively. The results indicate that Fe(1s) →
A1′ and Fe(1s) → E″ transitions are
quadrupole-allowed, whereas Fe(1s) → E′ transitions
are quadrupole-allowed (74.8%) and dipole-allowed (25.2%).62 However, the earlier report by Fronzoni and
co-workers showed a single pre-edge peak (Fe(1s) → E′
transitions) based on ab initio configuration interaction (CI) calculations.81 Although HERFD XANES can provide more detailed
information about the pre-edge region, such experiments are performed on insertion
device (ID) beamline of synchrotron radiation and at low-temperature
conditions to avoid radiation damage (using a He cryostat under vacuum
condition), which are not easy to access for general users. Here,
we re-examine the conventional Fe K-edge XANES of Fe(CO)5 at room temperature in ambient conditions and analyze the XANES
features by theoretical calculations.

Through using MST and
finite difference method (FDM) to solve the
Schrödinger equation, the initial and final states can be calculated
to obtain a good XANES simulation beyond the pre-edge region, which
indicates the good approximation of Fermi energy and spectral shape.
In general, it is hard to describe the pre-edge region very well based
on MST or FDM simulation. However, the MO-based TDDFT can calculate
the relative pre-edge transition energy quite well but not for the
Fermi level and even higher-energy region. Therefore, in this paper,
we will combine the advantage of both methods to interpret the pre-edge
and XANES transitions.

In this work, the EXAFS was initially
used to solve the structure
of Fe(CO)5. Subsequently, we used the combination of MO-based
TDDFT and FDM calculations—providing good XANES features of
the pre-edge region and rising edge up to 40 eV region, respectively—to
get a comprehensive insight into the relation between Fe K-edge spectrum
and electronic configuration. The XANES spectrum of the C4v structure in the transition state
was also simulated. The results can provide more spectral information
on the influence of geometric change from D3h to C4v symmetry.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Berry
Pseudorotation of Fe(CO)5
The trigonal bipyramid
molecule with a D3h symmetry
can exchange molecular orientation
through the Berry pseudorotation.25 The
movement that decreasing ∠Cax–Fe–Cax (θ) from 180 to 120° is accompanied by increasing
one of the ∠Ceq–Fe–Ceq (ϕ)
from 120 to 180° is performed to complete pseudorotation (see Scheme 1); the transformation
of molecule symmetry is D3h → C4v → D3h through this movement. To
examine the effect of structure transformation, the relaxed scan of D3h → C2v → C4v was performed, and the obtained Walsh diagram of
occupied MOs is shown in Figure 1. The energy change of MO 2E″ and 2E′
in the D3h structure,
which were split and reformed to MO 1B1 and 3E and 2A1 of the C4v structure
along with symmetry exchange, is most obvious. These MOs display π
back-donation interaction, which indicates that the metal–ligand
π bonding is affected obviously by a symmetry transformation.
On the other hand, the Fe(CO)5 of D3h is more stable by 1.59 kcal/mol than that
of C4v, which is consistent
with the activation barrier of ∼2 kcal/mol for Fe(CO)5 pseudorotation reported by previous theoretical24 and experimental literature studies.82 This result indicates molecular conformation change is
very fast so that EXAFS analysis is used to investigate the main structure
of Fe(CO)5 at room temperature.

Figure 1 Walsh diagrams of occupied
MOs in Fe(CO)5. From the D3h structure to the C4v structure, each scan step
decreases ∠Cax–Fe–Cax angle
by −1.53° and increases that of ∠Ceq–Fe–Ceq by 2.00° simultaneously.

The Berry pseudorotation is carried
out by increasing ∠Ceq–Fe–Ceq (ϕ) and decreasing ∠Cax–Fe–Cax (θ) simultaneously.

2.2 EXAFS Analysis
The best EXAFS fitting
result was obtained by the D3h symmetry of Fe(CO)5 as the molecular model. This
result is consistent with infrared spectra that the CO stretching
modes E′ and A2″ of the D3h structure83 were observed at 2013.68 and 2034.90 cm–1, respectively
(see Figure S1). The fitting parameters
and results are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. The first shell was fitted with single scattering contributed from
the five Fe–C scattering paths at 1.813(3) Å. The second
shell was fitted with single scattering contributed from Fe–O
(2.957(4) Å) and multiple scattering corresponding to Fe–C–O
(2.957(4) Å) and Fe–C–O–C (2.957(4) Å).
The single scattering and multiple scattering paths are described
in Figure 3. According
to the fitting results, the averaged Fe–C bond length of 1.813(3)
Å and C–O bond length of 1.144(7) Å were consistent
with the values of 1.806–1.832 Å for Fe–C bond
length and 1.127–1.153 Å for C–O bond length reported
by single-crystal data22,23 and electron diffraction experiments.18−21 Moreover, our EXAFS fitting result is consistent with Robertson’s
that, which are 1.813(3) Å for the Fe–C length and 2.948(4)
Å for the Fe–O length;84 the
Fe–O lengths are slightly varying and their difference is about
2 standard deviations.

2.3 Simulation and Analysis of Fe K-Edge Spectra
Based on the best-fitting EXAFS result obtained by the D3h structural model, the same
model also was used for the Fe K-edge XANES simulation. In addition,
the simulation spectra together with experimental results are shown
in Figure 4. In the
pre-edge region, two broad peaks at around 7115.3 and 7118.0 eV denoted
P1 and P2, respectively, are observed and assigned
to 1s → 3d transitions. These absorptions are through quadrupole-allowed
and dipolar-forbidden transitions.85 The
white line at about 7128.2 eV (denoted A) is assigned as 1s →
4p dipole-allowed transition. In the multipole scattering region, a very broad peak
at about 7151.0 eV (denoted B) is observed. The pre-edge region of
our experiment spectrum limited by the intrinsic resolution of conventional
K-edge spectra shows lower resolution than that of the HERFD XANES
spectrum.62 However, obtaining HERFD XANES
spectra needs the ID beamline of synchrotron radiation, and this resource
is not easy to get for general users. Moreover, two pre-edge peaks
observed in our experimental data demonstrate a certain extent of
quality in the conventional XAS K-edge beamline.

Figure 4 Experimental and theoretical
simulation of Fe K-edge spectra. The
top curve is the second derivative of the experimental spectrum (second
curve). The third, fourth, and fifth curves are simulated with muffin-tin
(MT) approximation and full potentials of Xα and Hedin–Lundqvist
(HL), respectively. The XANES features are labeled as P1, P2, and A based on the second derivative of the experimental
spectrum.

In general, both the calculations
of full potential and MT potential
reproduce the features of peaks A and B, but peak B in MT potential
approximation simulation has a larger deviation from the experimental
result than that of full potential. In two full potential simulations,
two pre-edge peaks, which are consistent with the experimental result,
can be observed. On the other hand, HL exchange potential demonstrated
that the pre-edge peaks at 7115.2 and 7117.9 eV (separated by 2.7
eV) are in more agreement with the experimental result than those of the
Xα exchange potential (pre-edge peaks at 7112.8 and 7116.5 eV,
separated by 3.7 eV). Comparing to the experimental spectrum, the
HL potential calculation provides better XANES features that will
be used for further analysis.

The densities of states (DOSs)
of Fe and C atoms are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. In these
figures, the top plot shows the total
DOS, and the projection of specific orbital angular moment is displayed
in the following plots. For example, the py, pz, and px orbitals (l = 1) correspond to ml = −1, 0, and 1, respectively.
The dxy, dyz, dz2, dxz, and dx2–y2 orbitals (l = 2) correspond to ml = −2 to 2, in turn.
The first pre-edge peak P1 is mainly contributed from the
Fe(dz2) orbital (Figure 5b) together with some hybridization
of Cax(pz), Ceq(px), and Ceq(py) orbitals, which implies that peak P1 is related
to σ* antibonding of the Fe–C bond. The second peak P2 is the linear combination of Fe(dxy), Fe(dx2–y2), Fe(dyz), and Fe(dxz) orbitals together with slight hybridization of p orbitals of carbon
atoms. In general, the intensity of the quadrupolar transition (Δl = ±2) is much weak. Later, more details will be discussed
through molecular orbital calculations.

d DOS of Fe.

Figure 6 p DOS plots of (a) axial and (b) equatorial
carbon atoms.

Take a closer to look at the features
of peak A, the population
of Fe(p) orbitals is observed in the 7125–7135 eV region in Figure 5a. This observation
is consistent with the assignment of the 1s → 4p dipolar-allowed
transition (Δl = ±1). On the other hand,
in the region of 7130–7133 eV beyond the maximum of peak A,
the contribution of Fe(pz) can be observed
at ∼7131.5 eV and Cax(pz) owns more the contribution of ∼7136 eV than Cax(px) and Cax(py) (see Figure 6a). These results indicate that the absorption peak of 7130–7135
eV is mainly related to the bonding between Fe and COax, which is consistent with Ahr’s report that the XANES spectrum
of 7131–7133 eV is sensitive to the COax substitution
by methanol.35

To gain more insight
into final-state orbitals, the MO-based TDDFT
calculations are performed to fit pre-edge peaks P1 and
P2 by B3LYP of origin (20%) and 30% exact exchange (see Figure S3). The spectrum simulated by B3LYP of
30% exact exchange can reproduce the apparent two pre-edge peaks better
than that of 20%, which shows a good agreement with the experimental
result. These fitting results and its associated molecular orbitals
are displayed in Figure 7. Peak P1 is caused by transition 1 of Fe(1s) →
2A1′(94%; 58% of Fe(dz2) in 2A1′), and the result of 1s →
dz2 transition is consistent
with FDMNES calculations. In addition, 2A1′ displays
antibonding interaction between 58% of Fe(dz2) orbitals and 39% of CO(σ) bonding so that
this transition is assigned as Fe(1s) → Fe–C(σ*)
antibonding character. Peak P2 is a linear combination
of four transitions of 1s to Fe–C(π*)-related MOs. The
two strongest transitions 4 and 5 at 7118.3 eV are Fe(1s) →
4E′a(76%)/3E′a(18%) and Fe(1s)
→ 4E′b(76%)/3E′b(18%),
respectively. These final states (4E′a, 3E′a, 4E′b, and 3E′b) have
dominated contributions derived from CO(π*) of around 71–87%,
and the others are mainly the contributions derived from Fe(dxy) and Fe(dx2–y2). At 7117.9 eV, the
weaker transitions 2 and 3 are Fe(1s) → 3E″b(78%)/3E″a(22%) and Fe(1s) → 3E″a(78%)/3E″b(22%), respectively, which consist
of Fe(dxz)/Fe(dyz) (∼25%) and CO(π*) (∼75%). Among these
final states, the 3E″a, 3E″b,
4E′a, and 4E′b MOs are the major
contributions of these four transitions, which indicate that π antibonding
character between Fe d orbitals and CO(π*) is related to peak
P2. On the other hand, the dipole and quadrupole contributions
to transition intensity are presented in Table S1, and transitions 1, 2, and 3 are quadrupole-allowed and
transitions 4 and 5 are dipole-allowed (60.5 and 36.3%) and quadrupole-allowed
(36.3 and 45.6%). These results are consistent with a previous report
by Atkins.62 Moreover, the calculation
without quadrupole contribution in earlier literature show only one
pre-edge peak caused by transitions to E′ orbitals.81 However, based on the study by Atkins et al.,62 different exchange functionals (BP86 and B3LYP)
can provide quite different results on the interpretation of pre-edge
peaks. To avoid such uncertainty, we first apply the finite difference
method (FDM) to simulate the XANES well and then TDDFT calculations
on the same geometric structure are used to complement the relation
between pre-edge peaks and chemical bonding.

and TDDFT-calculated (red dot and line)
pre-edge of Fe K-edge XANES for D3h Fe(CO)5. The theoretical calculated transition
peaks are shown in the vertical line. All transitions have been convoluted
with a pseudo-Voigt function with 1:1 ratio of Lorentzian to Gaussian
and 1.3 eV half-width to account for experimental and core hole broadening.
The TDDFT transition energy is shifted by 11.6 eV for comparison.

Based on the above analysis, peaks P1 and P2 are assigned as Fe(1s) → Fe–C(σ*)
and Fe(1s)
→ Fe–C(π*) transitions, respectively. The consistent
assignments were reported for the pre-edge peaks of carbonmonoxy-myoglobin
(six coordination of the Fe porphyrin system) in photon-induced lysis
of the Fe–CO bond experiment by Della Longa et al.36,38 In general, a phenomenon can be summarized
that the observation of two pre-edge peaks in K-edge XANES may imply
that one is related to σ bonding and the other is related to
π bonding interactions between metals and ligands.

To
understand the molecular geometric influence on the Fe K-edge
spectrum, MO-based TDDFT calculations of the C4v structure were also carried out. However,
because of the resolution limit of the dynamic experiment, the transition
state of C4v structure
is hard to distinguish by only a little variation of the general Fe K-edge XANES spectrum.
The calculated pre-edge spectrum of the C4v symmetry is displayed in Figure 8 by blue lines. Overall, the intensity of
peak P2 of the C4v structure is weaker than that of the D3h structure. Take a closer look at the feature
of peak P2 of the C4v structure, transitions 2 (Fe(1s) → 3A1(96%)),
3 (Fe(1s) → 2B1(99%)), 4 (Fe(1s) → 5Ea(56%)/5Eb(26%)/4Ea(9%)/4Eb(7%)), and 5 (Fe(1s) → 5Eb(56%)/5Ea(26%)/4Eb(9%)/4Ea(7%)) compose this absorption. Transitions
4 and 5 are degenerate. Moreover, the MO 5Ea and 5Eb are the main contributions of peak P2, which are
related to Fe–C(π*) orbitals. The intensities of transitions
4 and 5 are obviously weaker than that of the D3h structure so that the intensity of peak
P2 is reduced in the C4v structure. This result indicates that π antibonding
between Fe and CO is sensitive to changes in geometry, which is consistent
with the observation in the Walsh diagram (Figure 1). In the Walsh diagram of occupied MOs,
π bonding between Fe and CO is affected obviously by a symmetry
transformation. In peak P1, the simulated intensity result
of the C4v structure
is very similar to that of the D3h structure, but transition 1 (Fe(1s) → 3B2(79%)/2B2(18%)) of C4v looks more like a nonbonding interaction between Fe(dxy) and CO(π*). In addition, the simulation
results display that peak P2 intensity of the D3h structure is ∼30% greater than
that of the C4v structure.
These differences may be observed in the resonance inelastic X-ray
scattering (RIXS) spectrum at Fe K-edge, which can be further applied
to monitor the in situ reaction.

in the vertical line. All transitions have been convoluted with a
pseudo-Voigt function with 1:1 ratio of Lorentzian to Gaussian and

3 Conclusions
In our
studies, the D3h structure
of Fe(CO)5 is confirmed by EXAFS characterization.
Based on the combination with the results of FDM and MO-based TDDFT
and DFT calculations, we can provide a detailed information about
Fe K-edge XANES features of the d8-system iron complex.
The pre-edge P1 and P2 peaks are mainly the
transitions of Fe(1s) → Fe–C(σ*) and Fe(1s) →
Fe–C(π*), respectively. Based on the TDDFT calculations
and symmetry considerations, the pre-edge peaks are dominated by the
quadrupole transition. However, the MOs of A1′,
E″, and E′ are the hybridization of ligand p orbitals
and metal 3d orbitals. Peak A is assigned to the 1s → 4p transition,
and the region of 7130–7135 eV is related to the bonding between
Fe and axial CO. When Fe(CO)5 is in the C4v structure, the intensity of pre-edge
P2 will be decreased by ∼30% because the absorption
intensities of transitions 4 and 5 leading to peak P2 are
weakened. This result, which corresponds to the observation of occupied
frontier orbitals from the Walsh diagram, indicates that π bonding
of Fe and CO is sensitive to changes in geometry. Additionally, the
variation of pre-edge P2 should be observed in the RIXS
spectrum at Fe K-edge. Our results may provide useful information
to monitor the in situ reaction of metal–CO or similar compounds
with π acceptor ligands like metal–CN complexes. On the
other hand, we also provide a methodology that can be utilized by
more general users working on metal K-edge XANES research, where the
same structure model is used for EXAFS fitting, XANES simulation,
and pre-edge analysis.

4 Experimental and Computational
Section
4.1 X-ray Absorption Spectrum Measurements
The X-ray absorption spectrum of Fe K-edge was taken at the Taiwan
Light Source (TLS) BL17C wiggler beamline at the National Synchrotron
Radiation Research Center (NSRRC), Hsinchu, Taiwan. A double-crystal
Si(111) monochromator was installed, and the energy resolution (ΔE/E) was about 2 × 10–4. High harmonics were rejected by Rh-coated mirrors. The spectra
were recorded in fluorescent mode and measured by a Lytle detector.
The data collection range was from
6.9 to 8.1 KeV. A reference spectrum of Fe foil was always measured
simultaneously, and its first inflection point at 7112.0 eV was used
for energy calibration. Two drops of liquid Fe(CO)5 were
first dropped on the center of filter paper (made by α cotton
cellulose, ADVANTEC, Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd.) and waited for the diffusion
of liquid Fe(CO)5 on cotton cellulose to almost complete
by visualization. Then, we cut this filter paper in a suitable size
for measurements at room temperature. This implies what we measured
are those liquid Fe(CO)5 drops dispersed on the surface
of cotton cellulose so that the self-absorption effects of X-ray photons
can also be reduced.60

4.2 EXAFS Data Analysis
The data analysis
procedure basically follows the previous report by Hsu et al.30 The obtained XAS data were
corrected for background and normalized by the AUTOBK program,86 and χ(k) function of
EXAFS was determined by χ(k) = [μ(k) – μ0 (k)]/Δμ0(0), where μ(k) is the measured absorption
coefficient, μ0(k) is the background,
Δμ0(0) is the edge jump, and k is the wave vector of the photoelectron, followed by the definition
of .

Based on the local maxima
of the
first derivative of the XANES spectra (dμ/dE), E0 was set at 7125.5 eV. The experimental
χ(k) in the EXAFS region 2.20 ≤ k ≤ 13.95 was further weighted by k3 and then Fourier-transformed into the R-space as FT[k3χ(k)]. The theoretical EXAFS signals χ(k) were
calculated by FEFF8.4, according to the structural model of Fe(CO)5.

The EXAFS data analysis was done according to the
formula 1  where Fj(k) is the backscattering amplitude from each
of the Nj atoms in the
shell at distance Rj (relative
to the absorbing atom), exp(−2k2σj2) is the Debye–Waller
factor with a mean-squared displacement σj2, S02 is
the amplitude reduction factor, δj(k) is the total phase shift, and λ(k) is the photoelectron mean free path. We fitted FT[k3χ(k)] in the range of Table 1 with the structural
parameters varied the bond distance (R) and the bond
variance σ2, which is related to the Debye–Waller
factor resulting from thermal motion, and the pairwise static disorder
of the absorbing and scattering atoms, the nonstructural parameter E0 (the energy at which k =
0) was also allowed to vary but was restricted to a common value for
every component in a given fit, then the S0 value was set at 0.88 for the entire course of the fit, and coordination
numbers were systematically varied in the course of the fit but were
fixed within a given fit by FEFFIT program.87 The data fitting quality was evaluated with the goodness-of-fit
factor, defined as 2  where χ ~
= k3χ and n is
the number of evaluations
of fi, with fi = χ ~datai – χ ~modeli minimized in the nonlinear
least-squares fitting algorithm.

4.3 Geometry
Optimization and Electronic Structure
Calculations
The calculations of geometry optimization for
iron pentacarbonyl were carried out by spin-restricted DFT-B3LYP with
the combination of a triple-ζ basis set 6-311G(d,p) for the iron atom and a
double-ζ basis set 6–31G(d,p) for other atoms. The frequency
calculations were performed to confirm that the molecules locate at
minimum or transition state, and 0 and 1 of the imaginary frequency
are obtained for D3h and C4v structures, respectively.
These results indicate that the D3h structure is minimum and the C4v structure is the transition state. Gaussian 09 (ver.
A.02) software88 is used to complete the
above calculations.

In general, the local coordinates were set
so that the Fe atom is at the origin and the z axis
is parallel to the C3/C4 rotational axis (see Scheme 1). The x axis of the D3h structure
is aligned with one of equatorial CO (COeq; axial CO is
denoted COax) and that of the C4v structure is set as bisecting the ∠C–Fe–C.
The electronic structure and MO-based TDDFT calculations of these
structures were performed by the ORCA4.0.1 package.89 The B3LYP of origin (20%) and 30% exact exchange were used
together with the same basis set as used in geometry optimization.
The relativistic effect is considered by zeroth-order regular approximation
(ZORA). For the TDDFT calculations, both dipole and quadrupole transitions
are included and the calculations involved 150 transitions from Fe(1s).
The Löwdin population analysis was used to obtain the contributions
of atomic orbitals in each MO. For comparing the experimental data
to theoretical calculations, the calculated transition peaks are shifted
by +11.6 eV, where such constant shift of energy has also been reported by DeBeer George and others, which demonstrated that no extra error
was included.69 When the 1s electron is
excited, the energy of d orbitals decreases due to the formation of a core hole.81 This may be one of reasons to cause such energy
shift in TDDFT calculations.

4.4 XANES Simulations
Full multiple scattering
(FMS) and FDM were used to simulate Fe K-edge XANES spectra by solving
the Schrödinger equation. FMS within the muffin-tin (MT) approximation—the
potential is spherical shape around the atoms and is constant in the
remaining space—is performed by the FEFF8.4 program.90 FDM within full potential, which considers no approximation
on the form of the potential, is carried out by the FDMNES (ver. 2nd
of August 2018) program.91 In FDM calculations,
both Hedin–Lundqvist (HL) and Xalpha (Xα; parameter is
1/3) exchange–correlation potentials were used in the self-consistent
calculations and the HL potential is in better agreement with experimental
data in both pre-edge and near-edge structures. Moreover, the electronic
configurations of Fe, C, and O used in FDM calculation are [Ar]3d54s24p1, 1s22s22p2, and 1s22s22p4, respectively.
To simulate the XANES features, the calculation is performed including
all atoms within 3.0 Å away from the central Fe atom and both
dipolar and quadrupolar transitions are included in the calculation.
The energy steps used in the calculations are 0.1, 0.01, 0.2, 1.0,
and 2.0 eV for energy ranges [−10.0, −5.0], [−5.0,
6.0], [6.0, 15.0], [15.0, 40.0], and [40.0, 60.0], respectively. The
calculation results are convoluted by an arctangent function to obtain
the final spectrum. The five convolution parameters of the spectrum
in the HL potential, which are the core-level width, the Fermi energy,
the center and the width of arctangent function, and the width of
the final state, were set as 0.5, −4, 20, 45, and 25 eV, respectively;
the setting combination of 1.25, 5, 30, 60, and 15 eV was used for
Xα potential. The overall simulated spectra are shifted to align
their first-derivative maximum with that of experimental spectra.
