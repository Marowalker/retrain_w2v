Carbonaceous or oxy-carbon species
are intermediates formed during
CxHy combustion
on a Ptn/Al2O3 catalyst,
which contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. The accumulation
of the carbonaceous species, arguably, leads to catalytic deactivation;
therefore, their removal is of importance. As the diffusion process
is occasionally the rate-determining step in the growth of carbonaceous
species, the present study aims to reveal the diffusion mechanisms.
The free energy barriers of acetate, formate, and methoxy diffusion
on the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface were evaluated
through extensive metadynamics simulations at the density-functional
tight-binding level. The present work deduces that each adopted carbonaceous
species exhibits different diffusion mechanisms and supports experimental
evidence that the acetate species exhibits the slowest diffusivity
among the adopted carbonaceous species.

1 Introduction
The three-way catalyst
(TWC) technology is among the innovative
catalyst technologies for eliminating the generated hazardous exhaust
gases, that is, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburnt hydrocarbons (CxHy) from vehicles.1−3 The catalysts are composed of, and not limited to, noble metals
(Pt, Pd, or Rh) and metal oxides. The commonly used metal oxides that
support TWC are alumina (Al2O3),4−7 zirconia (ZrO2),8−12 and ceria (CeO2).13−17 Experimental18−20 and theoretical21−24 studies were performed extensively
for exploring the catalytic activity and elucidating the reaction
mechanism.22,23 During the removal process, CO
and CxHy are
oxidized into CO2, whereas NOx is reduced to N2.25 In such
reactions, the CxHy oxidation leads to the formation of intermediates reported
in ref (26), namely,
oxygenated carbonaceous (oxy-carbon) species. The oxy-carbon intermediates
are mainly accumulated on the Al2O3 surface.26 The role of the oxy-carbon species is questionable.
However, it has been presumed that the oxy-carbons only act as inert
spectators during the oxidation reaction.26 An experimental study was performed to investigate oxy-carbon growth
on a metal oxide surface.26

The growth
of the oxy-carbon species was observed by diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy coupled with Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy.26 The same technique
has been used extensively for investigating oxidation over various
catalysts, namely, Pd/CeO2/Al2O3,27 Pt/Al2O3,28−30 Pt/WOx/Al2O3,28 MgCr2O4,31,32 Co3O4,32 CuO,32 and Pt/CeO2–ZrO2.33 The oxy-carbon species observed on
the support materials include acetate (CH3COO–),28,31,32 formate (HCOO–),27,28,31,32 alkoxy (RO–),32 carbonate (CO32–),27−29,33 bicarbonate (HCO3–),33 acetone,31,32 and unidentified species.30 The unidentified species was detected when the
experiment was conducted in the presence of the SO2 gas.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) successfully elucidated the
composition, location, reactivity, and the role of the oxy-carbon
species in hydrocarbon oxidation.34 The
catalytic activity of the supported nanoparticles was also influenced
by the kinetics of the TPO process, where the activity increased as
the diffusion barrier decreased.34

Based on the previous experimental study in ref (26), the reactions represented
in eqs 1–8 are plausible elementary reactions for the formation
of the oxy-carbon species, where * denotes the active site of the
surface. No observation was made to elaborate where the reactions
were occurring. Assuming that all the processes occur on the metal
nanocluster surface, the oxy-carbon species would spill over on the
γ-Al2O3 surface. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  

The previous experimental
study showed that it is more difficult
to oxidize acetate species than the alkoxy and ketone derivatives.26,34 It was further confirmed that the diffusion of oxy-carbon species
plays an important role in the removal process, as diffusion is the
rate-determining step of oxy-carbon oxidation.34 Motivated by the aforementioned experimental facts, in
the present theoretical study, the diffusion process of oxy-carbon
species was elucidated via molecular dynamics simulations at the density-functional
tight-binding (DFTB) level.35−38 Molecular details on the diffusion mechanism and
the surface driving force γ-Al2O3 were
investigated.

2 Computational Details
All DFTB calculations were performed using an in-house code DC-DFTBMD
program,39,40 whereas the reference calculations were
performed at the density-functional theory (DFT) level using the Vienna
ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).41,42 The DFTB calculation
was performed using the third-order variant (DFTB3) with the modified
parameter set made using the automatized DFTB parameterization toolkit,99 hereafter called the Al2O3 parameter. As a reference, the calculations were also performed
at the DFT level using the generalized-gradient approximation functional,
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof, revised for solids (PBEsol).43 To describe the dispersion interaction between
the oxy-carbon and the γ-Al2O3 surface,
the DFT-D3 dispersion correction with Becke–Johnson damping
was employed in both DFTB and DFT calculations.44 The initial structure of the bulk γ-Al2O3 was reconstructed based on the information obtained
from refs (45) and (46). The chosen initial structure
is a nonspinel type that has been extensively studied in some previous
works.24,47−52

First, the initial geometry of the bulk Al2O3 was optimized at the DFT and DFTB levels. The lattice parameters
and the optimized geometries were considered for generating the slab
structures. The (100)-γ-Al2O3 slabs were
generated by cutting the atoms along the (100) plane. Two slab models
with different sizes that consist of 160 and 960 atoms, respectively,
are shown in Figure 1. To overcome the computational cost for a large system, the divide-and-conquer
(DC) option in the DCDFTBMD program was enabled.39,40,53,54 The subsystems
were created automatically using the cubic grid with dimensions of
3 × 3 × 3 Å3. A buffer radius of 6 Å
was used to adjust the accuracy to the same level as the conventional
DFTB method.

Figure 1 Representative (a) small and (b) large-size slab models
adopted
in the present work.

During the geometry optimization,
three-bottom layers of the slab
were fixed, while other atoms were relaxed. The oxy-carbon intermediates,
namely, methoxy (CH3O–), bicarbonate
(HCO3–), formate (HCOO–), acetate (CH3COO–), and propionate (CH3CH2COO–) were attached on the slab surface. In each prepared
structure, oxygen atoms of the oxy-carbon are bound to aluminum atoms,
such that they form an octahedral geometry centered at the aluminum
atom. The adsorption energies between the oxy-carbon and (100)-γ-Al2O3 slab were calculated at the DFT and DFTB levels
with the following formula 9  

Eads, Eslab, and Ecarb represent
the total energies
of the adsorbed system, slab, and oxy-carbon species, respectively.

The adsorption energies calculated at the DFTB level were compared
to the reference calculations at the DFT level. After confirming the
parameter accuracy in describing the binding energy, the optimized
adsorbed structures were used for MD simulations. At first, the equilibrations
were performed under the canonical (NVT) ensemble
at the DFTB3-D3(BJ) level for 20 ps with a time step of 1.0 fs to
integrate the equation of motion. The equilibrated structures with
the details summarized in Table 1 were adopted for further production runs via the metadynamics
sampling scheme.55−58 The surface coverages listed in Table 1 are calculated based on eq 10. 10

Under the metadynamics scheme, the Al–O coordination
number,
as formulated in eq 11, was chosen as the collective variable. 11  rij and r0 denote the Al–O
distance and cutoff radius, respectively. The value r0 = 1.9 Å was specified to smoothly define Al–O
bond breaking and formation during the metadynamics simulations. The
Gaussian bias potential with a height of 1.88 kcal/mol and a width
of 0.1 (dimensionless, as the coordination number was chosen as the
collective variable) was added every 40 fs. The simulations were performed
until the estimated free energy barriers converged. The free energy
barriers converged after performing 9 metadynamics trajectories with
a simulation length of 60 ps. The free energy surfaces were reconstructed
by estimating the unbiased probability density function via the weighted
histogram analysis method.59

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Structural Property of
Bulk γ-Al2O3
The cell parameters
of the optimized
bulk structure are listed in Table 2. All DFT functionals fairly reproduce the experimental
cell volumes. The PBEPBE functional shows the largest deviation of
6.94% with a volume of 49.61 Å3, while the experimental
cell volume is 46.39 Å3. Other functionals, such as
PBEsol, M11-L, MN12-L, and PW91, exhibit smaller volume deviations
of −3.54, −1.60, 1.42, and 2.18%, respectively. The
DFTB variants also show smaller volume deviations, namely, –0.13
and −1.74%, for the DFTB3 and DFTB3-D3(BJ) methods, respectively.
Despite the volume deviation, the dispersion correction is important
for describing weak interactions between oxy-carbon moieties.

3.2 Adsorption
of Oxy-Carbon Species on the (100)
Surface of γ-Al2O3
The oxy-carbon
species or carbonaceous species was deposited on the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface, which was formed after the spillover
process. The optimized geometries of the oxy-carbon species adsorbed
on the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface, namely,
methoxy (#1–#2), ethoxy (#3–#5), formate (#6–#9),
acetate (#10–#13), propionate (#14–#17), and bicarbonate
(#18–#20) are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Adsorbed methoxy (#1–#2), ethoxy (#3–#5),
formate
(#6–#9), acetate (#10–#13), propionate (#14–#17),
and bicarbonate (#18–#20) species on (100)-γ-Al2O3 obtained from geometry optimizations at the DFTB3-D3(BJ)
level.

The calculated adsorption energies
(ΔEads) for the acetate, formate,
and methoxy species on (100)-γ-Al2O3 are
shown in Table 3. The
DFTB method predicts shorter O–Al
bond lengths with a mean average deviation (MAD) of 0.06 Å, relative
to the bond lengths obtained at the PBEsol level. Despite such short
bond distances, the calculated ΔEads at the DFTB level are smaller than those calculated at the DFT level.
The adsorption energies are also well reproduced with a MAD of 0.09
eV (2.08 kcal/mol). Such a deviation is under the level of accuracy
of the DFTB method as reported in previous works.62−66 Inclusion of the dispersion correction to both DFT
and DFTB calculations also leads to the same MAD as shown in Table 4.

a Herein,
the O atom refers to the
one that belongs to the oxy-carbon species. All calculations were
performed with the DFT-D3(BJ) dispersion correction.

b Differences from the PBEsol method
are shown in parentheses.

Based on Table 4,
the calculated Eads values strongly
depend on the location where the oxy-carbon is adsorbed on the surface.
According to the estimated Eads values
at the DFTB level, the tendency of the oxy-carbon adsorbed on the
surface of (100)-γ-Al2O3 is ethoxy ≈
methoxy > bicarbonate > propionate ≈ formate > acetate.
Such
an order suggests that removing the acetate species from the surface
is energetically easier than that of the formate and methoxy species.
However, despite this the acetate species exhibits the smallest adsorption
energy, it does not mean that it is easier to be removed from the
surface. Because one acetate molecule is adsorbed to the surface via
two O–Al bonds, a complete acetate removal requires dissociation
of those bonds. Therefore, a more thorough analysis on the free energy
of diffusion in the next subsection is of importance to further determine
which oxy-carbon species is easier to be removed from the surface.

3.3 Diffusion of Acetate, Formate, and Methoxy
Species on the (100) Surface of γ-Al2O3
Snapshots of acetate, formate, and methoxy diffusion are
shown in Figure 3.
Initially, the oxygen from the acetate, formate, and methoxy was attached
on the aluminum atom of the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface. For the case of acetate and formate, the O–Al bond
dissociation retains another O–Al bond on the surface. As a
result, the remaining O–Al bond becomes flexible and thus it
performs a rotation that enables the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group
to interact with another empty orbital of the aluminum atom. As the
rotation that took place occurred right after the bond dissociation,
the process is analogous to ballet.

Figure 3 Representative metadynamics snapshots
of (a) acetate, (b) formate,
and (c) methoxy diffusion on (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface.

Similar to the case of the acetate
diffusion mechanism, in the
beginning, O–Al, the bond between formate and the (100)-γ-Al2O3, was dissociated. Unlike the case of acetate,
where oxygen is the only atom that can interact with the surface,
herein, the hydrogen atom has a tendency to interact with the surface
oxygen atoms. Such an interaction is slightly weaker with a bond length
of 1.82 Å, whereas the O–Al bond length between formate
and the surface is 1.75 Å. Once the H–O interaction is
complete, the formate moiety is destabilized, leading to the dissociation
of the second O–Al. Therefore, generally, formate diffusion
is facilitated by a ballet jumping motion that originates from the
formation of the H–O bond.

In contrast with the acetate
and formate cases, the methoxy radical
has only one O–Al bond with the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface. As shown in Figure 3c, at first, the radical rotates until it
finds a good conformation to promote O–Al bond dissociation.
Once it is detached from the surface, it performs a random vehicular
diffusion67,68 until a proper orientation is identified
for it to be re-adsorbed on to the surface. The random motion on the
surface increases the degree of freedom, in particular, for reorienting
and forming the O–Al bond.

To further investigate these
three mechanisms, the free energy
diffusion surfaces were re-constructed and are shown in Figure 4. The free energy barriers,
ΔF‡, are summarized in Table 5. As shown in Figure 4a, there are two
activated complexes formed during acetate diffusion, with diffusion
barriers of 8.01 and 25.31 kcal/mol, respectively. These transition
states refer to the dissociation of the O–Al bonds, indicating
that each O–Al bond has a different strength, with a ratio
ΔFf2‡/ΔFf1‡ of 3.16. A lower ΔFf2‡/ΔFf1‡ ratio represents faster diffusivity
as the second bond dissociation O–Al is the rate-determining
step of the overall diffusion process. On the other hand, owing to
the dissociations facilitated by the H–O surface interaction,
the formate diffusion exhibits a lower ΔFf2‡/ΔFf1‡ of 1.90, leading to faster
diffusivity than the acetate radical. The third step of formate diffusion
involves the dissociation of a relatively weak H–O bond, which
is represented by a low free energy barrier of 5.73 kcal/mol.

free energy surfaces of (a) acetate, (b) formate,
and (c) methoxy diffusion.

Acetate, Formate, and Methoxy Diffusion on the (100)-γ-Al2O3 Surface in kcal/mol
species	ΔFf1‡	ΔFf2‡	ΔFf3‡	ΔFf2‡/ΔFf1‡	ΔFb1‡	ΔFb2‡	ΔFb3‡	
acetate	8.01	25.31	 	3.16	9.59	10.97	 	
formate	6.82	12.95	5.73	1.90	19.28	7.42	1.58	
methoxy	15.46	 	 	 	25.45	 	 	
As described above for the case of methoxy
diffusion, only one
O–Al bond was dissociated with a moderately high free energy
barrier of 15.46 kcal/mol. The ΔFf1‡ of methoxy diffusion is higher than that of formate diffusion, but
still lower than that of acetate. As the methoxy radical performs Brownian diffusion before it is re-adsorbed
to the surface, the transition state becomes broader with a few noises
as the marks of the small vehicular diffusion barrier. The Brownian
diffusion is rather random; therefore, the free energy barrier for
methoxy diffusion hardly converges, that is, with a standard deviation
of 2.5 kcal/mol.

Note that the ΔF‡ values
listed in Table 5 are
in the range of experimental values, namely, 5.74–26.05 kcal/mol.34,69−71 Moreover, in agreement with the TPO experiment, removing
acetate radicals is more difficult compared to removing enolate, aliphatic
ester, and acetone.34 Based on the MD simulation
at the DFTB level, for the case of the acetate radical, the surface
atom configuration, in particular, surface O–Al–O angles
where the oxy-carbon was adsorbed (α and β), is primarily
responsible for the O–Al bond dissociation. As shown in Figure 5a,b, when the O–Al
bond dissociates, namely, when nO–Al reaches zero, α decreases from 105 to 85°, while β
increases from 70 to 85°. On the other hand, for the case of
formate as shown in Figure 5c,d, the α and β angles do not change significantly,
in particular, α is relatively stable at 82°, while β
slightly increases from 84 to 88°. In this case, the surface
atoms provided a lower driving force for facilitating formate diffusion.
As explained previously, formate diffusion is partly facilitated by
the interaction between the hydrogen atom of the formate and the oxygen
atom on the surface; hence, the diffusion takes place with less efforts
from the surface. In stark contrast, as shown in Figure 5e,f, both, the α and
β angles, do not change significantly during methoxy diffusion.
Although methoxy diffusion is not the fastest among the adopted oxy-carbon
species, the surface atoms have a low contribution to the overall
diffusion process.

and β angles and the coordination number of oxygen atom, nO–Al of acetate (a,b), formate (c,d),
and methoxy species (e,f).

3.4 Coverage Dependence on the Barriers to Acetate
Diffusion
The surface coverage affects the estimated barriers
of acetate diffusion as summarized in Table 6. At a low surface coverage, namely, 0.83%,
the free energy barriers for the dissociations of the second and first
O–Al bonds are 11.23 and 20.92 kcal/mol, respectively. The
first intermediate state, where one O–Al bond remains adsorbed
on the surface, is more stable than the initial state, as implied
by the backward free energy barrier of 17.79 kcal/mol. The first intermediate
state is even more stable than the final state where the remaining
O–Al bond is dissociated. Conversely, despite the high free-energy
dissociation of the second O–Al bond, the backward reaction
requires a lower energy of 5.28 kcal/mol. Hence, the second O–Al
bond dissociation is an endergonic process with ΔFf2 > 0, which indicates that a larger
thermal energy is required to induce spontaneity.

Table 6 Estimated Free Energy Barriers (ΔF‡) and Free Energy Differences (ΔF) of Acetate
Diffusion at Different Surface Coverage Levels
surface coverage [%]	ΔFf1‡ [kcal/mol]	ΔFf2‡ [kcal/mol]	ΔFb1‡ [kcal/mol]	ΔFb2‡ [kcal/mol]	ΔFf1 [kcal/mol]	ΔFf2 [kcal/mol]	
0.83	11.23	20.92	17.79	5.28	–6.56	15.64	
1.67	4.39	14.41	7.61	3.77	–3.22	10.64	
9.17	4.61	15.29	1.80	5.92	2.80	9.37	
As the surface coverage increases to 1.67%, both ΔFf1‡ and ΔFf2‡ decrease to 4.39 and 14.41 kcal/mol, respectively. Similarly, the
barriers for backward processes also decrease to 7.61 and 3.77 kcal/mol.
Overall, such changes lead to an increase in the free energy difference
for the first dissociation process, namely, −3.22 kcal/mol.
This indicates that the dissociation of the first O–Al bond
becomes more energy demanding. On the other hand, the dissociation
of the second bond requires a lower energy than the one at the coverage
of 0.83%, with a free energy difference of 10.64 kcal/mol. Overall,
at a surface coverage of 1.67%, a lower temperature will be sufficient
to promote the entire diffusion process as the total free energy difference,
ΔFf1 + ΔFf2 of 7.42 kcal/mol, is smaller
than the one at 0.83% surface coverage, namely, 9.08 kcal/mol. The
decrement in ΔFf2 helps mitigate the increment in ΔFf1. It is speculated that such decrement stems from
the surface deformation when an additional acetate molecule is adsorbed
on the surface.

When the surface coverage is further increased
to 9.17%, the dissociation
barriers of the first and second O–Al bonds slightly increase
to 4.61 and 15.29 kcal/mol, respectively. These increments are, however,
insignificant, at 0.22 and 0.88 kcal/mol, respectively. Such values
are still within the statistical error of metadynamics sampling and
re-weighting. In contrast, the backward process for the first dissociation
step is reduced significantly from 7.61 to 1.80 kcal/mol. As the backward
process is easier, the first dissociation process becomes thermodynamically
unfavorable with a free energy difference of 2.80 kcal/mol. The difficulty
with dissociating the first O–Al bond may arise from the steric
hindrance between the acetate moieties. On the other hand, the second
dissociation process is slightly easier than that with a surface coverage
of 1.67%, with a free energy difference of 9.37 kcal/mol. As acetate
diffusion is difficult at 9.17% surface coverage, one needs to control
and minimize the growth of the acetate radical on the Al2O3 surface.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
metadynamics simulations at the DFTB level successfully
revealed molecular mechanisms of acetate, formate, and methoxy diffusion
on a (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface. The present
study has examined three diffusion mechanisms that depend on unique
interactions between the oxy-carbon radical with the surface. Although
acetate and formate have the same functional group, namely, carboxylate
(−COO•), they exhibit different diffusion
mechanisms. For these carboxylic species, the oxygen atoms were attached
asymmetrically, where the O–Al bonds had nonequivalent strength.
The acetate diffusion uniquely mimics a ballerina dancer, namely,
one O–Al bond rotation occurs immediately after another O–Al
bond dissociates. The acetate radical displays the slowest diffusivity
among the other oxy-carbon species adopted in the present work. Further
investigation shows that the spontaneity of the O–Al bond dissociation
is affected by the surface coverage. Increasing the surface coverage
to 9.17% leads to nonspontaneous O–Al bond dissociation. Although
further investigation to elucidate this phenomenon has not been carried
out, it is speculated that the steric hindrance between acetate residues
is at play in suppressing the acetate diffusion. The present work
suggests that removing the acetate species from the surface is easier
at an early stage of its growth, that is, when the surface coverage
less than 9%.

On the other hand, the formate radical exhibits
the fastest diffusion
by forming the O–H bond between the hydrogen atom of the formate
radical with the surface oxygen atom. The nature of its fast diffusion,
however, is experimentally unobservable, as the diffusion of the formate
radical is indistinguishable among the other oxy-carbon species.26 The present work suggests that it is easier
to remove the formate radical from the (100)-γ-Al2O3 surface than the acetate or methoxy species. In contrast
to the acetate and formate cases, the methoxy radical performs Brownian
diffusion. As only one O–Al bond dissociates, Brownian diffusion
occurs right after dissociation. Despite the dissociation of only
one O–Al bond, the process is slower than formate diffusion
due to the lack of surface deformation during methoxy diffusion. Overall,
the order of diffusivity among the adopted oxy-carbon species is acetate
< methoxy < formate. While the order was not experimentally
confirmed, it was reported that the acetate radical exhibits the slowest
diffusion.34
