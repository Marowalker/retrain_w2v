The
structural effects of substrates on the incident photon-to-current
conversion efficiency (IPCE) of Zn porphyrin (ZnP) dyes (ZnP-ref,
YD2, and ZnPBAT) have been studied on well-defined single-crystal
surfaces of rutile TiO2 (TiO2(111), TiO2(100), and TiO2(110)). IPCE of ZnP-ref depends
on the structure of the substrates remarkably: TiO2(100)
< TiO2(110) < TiO2(111). IPCE of ZnP-ref/TiO2(111) is 13 times as high as that of ZnP-ref/TiO2(100) at 570 nm. YD2 and ZnPBAT also give the highest IPCE on TiO2(111). The relative coverages of the porphyrin dyes give the
following order: TiO2(111) < TiO2(110) <
TiO2(100). This order is opposite to that of IPCEs. The
orientation of the dyes is predicted using density functional theory
calculations on simplified models of TiO2 surfaces. The
highest IPCE on TiO2(111) is attributed to the high rate
of electron transfer through the space due to the fluctuation of the
tilt angle of the adsorbed dyes.

Introduction
Power supply depends
on fossil fuel at present,1 and emission
of CO2 causes global warming. A
solar cell generates power using sunlight without any emission of
CO2; it is one of the most important technologies for building
up a sustainable society.

Bell laboratories developed a Si solar
cell in 1955.2 The power-conversion efficiency
(η) of
the Si solar cell is high;3 however, its
production is expensive. TiO2 also absorbs light and generates
power. The cost of TiO2 production is lower than that for
Si. However, the band gap of TiO2 is too large for the
visible light to excite electrons from the valence band to the conduction
band.

In 1979, Goodenough et al. reported dye-sensitized solar
cells
(DSSCs), in which Ru complex dye is adhered on TiO2 nanoparticles.4 After that, Grätzel et al. achieved high
incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) using Ru complex
dye at 450 nm.5 Especially, they developed
the solar cells based on a Ru complex dye-sensitized porous TiO2 electrode with high values of η.6,7 Encouraged
by these seminal studies, the DSSCs have attracted worldwide research
interest in basic and practical aspects.8,9

In recent
years, the η-values of DSSCs based on push–pull-type
porphyrin sensitizers have significantly increased and reached exceptionally
high values of ca. 14%.3,10−16 However, the theoretical maximum η-value of DSSCs is predicted
to be 25.6%,17 and the precise understanding
of the relationships between the sensitizer and semiconductor is necessary
to realize ideal photovoltaic performances. Imahori et al. previously
reported that the rate of electron transfer depends on the orientation
of the adsorbed Zn porphyrin (ZnP) dye on TiO2 nanoparticles.13,18,19 Electron transfer between the
porphyrin ring and TiO2 occurs through the space, not through
the spacer connecting the porphyrin ring to TiO2. In fact,
the orientation of the porphyrin sensitizer on the TiO2 surface affects the electron injection and charge recombination
processes and the resultant η-values. Accordingly, if the orientation
of the dye molecule on the TiO2 surface is suitably controlled,
the η value may be enhanced dramatically. Well-defined single-crystal
surfaces of TiO2 are expected to control the orientation
of adsorbed dyes. Previous papers report the shape effects on η,20 photocatalytic activity,21 and electron transfer rates from dyes to the substrate22 using shape-controlled TiO2 nanoparticles.
However, a shape-controlled nanoparticle is composed of several kinds
of faces, edges, and corners; it is difficult to determine the factors
governing the structural effects clearly. A well-defined single-crystal
surface is the best platform to study the structural effects precisely.
Parkinson et al. reported pioneering studies using well-defined rutile
and anatase TiO2 single-crystal surfaces.23−30 However, there has been no report on the structural effects on IPCE
of ZnP dyes on single-crystal surfaces of TiO2.

In
this article, the structural effects of the substrate on IPCE
have been studied on the low-index planes of rutile TiO2 (TiO2(111), TiO2(100), and TiO2(110)). Although some papers reported basic study of DSSCs on natural
anatase TiO2 single-crystal surfaces,23−26 we adopted rutile TiO2 single-crystal surfaces that can be obtained commercially. The adsorbed
dye molecules are ZnP’s: 5,10,15,20-tetramesitylporphyrinatozinc(II)
(ZnP-ref),31 ZnPBAT,32 and YD2.33−35 Molecular structures of these dyes are shown in Figure 1.

of ZnP’s.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows topographic
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images (100 × 100 nm2) and cross-sectional profiles of TiO2(100), TiO2(110), and TiO2(111) surfaces in air after chemical
polishing and thermal annealing. Although the surfaces cannot be imaged
in atomic resolution, the cross-sectional profiles show that roughness
of each surface was within 0.2 nm. The ion radii of O2– and Ti4+ are 0.14 and 0.075 nm, respectively; all of
the TiO2 surfaces are atomically flat. When the TiO2 surface is irradiated with UV light in sulfuric acid solution,
photoetching of TiO2 occurs.37 The photoetching during the measurement of IPCE is not taken into
account because we irradiate visible light in the solution without
sulfuric anion.

Figure 2 STM topographic images (upper panels) and cross-sectional
profiles
(lower panels) of TiO2 in air. TiO2(100): It (tunneling current) = 1.00 nA, Eb (bias voltage) = −159.5 mV; TiO2(110): It = 0.84 nA, Eb =
−518.7 mV; TiO2(111): It = 0.83 nA, Eb = −451.0 mV.

Figure 3 shows the
time courses of photocurrent of ZnP on single-crystal surfaces of
TiO2 as representatives. We did not measure the photocurrent
below 450 nm because the photocurrent from bulk TiO2 overlaps
the dye-sensitized photocurrent.39 IPCE
values were calculated using the averaged photocurrent between 0 and
5 s. No photocurrent was observed without the adsorbed dyes between
450 and 650 nm.

Figures 4, 5, and 6 show IPCE spectra
of single-crystal surfaces of TiO2 modified with ZnP-ref,
YD2, and ZnPBAT dyes, respectively. The values of IPCE are 3 orders
of magnitude lower than those of the conventional dye-modified TiO2 films, which is consistent with the ratio of surface areas
between the single-crystal surfaces and mesoporous films. IPCE depends
on the structure of all of the dye-modified single-crystal surfaces
of TiO2. For ZnP-ref dye, IPCE increases in accord with
the absorption spectrum of the dye on TiO2(111) and TiO2(110): ZnP-ref on TiO2(111) and TiO2(110) gives maximum of IPCE at 570 nm. However, IPCE on TiO2(100) does not correlate with the absorption spectrum, giving the
lower value than that on other surfaces between 450 and 650 nm. IPCE
on ZnP-ref/TiO2 (111) is 13 times as high as that on TiO2 (100) at 570 nm.

M LiI/CH3CN. The inset shows the absorption spectrum of
0.05 mM ZnP-ref in
ethanol.

Figure 5 IPCE spectra of YD2/TiO2 in 0.15
M LiI/CH3CN. The inset shows the absorption spectrum of
0.02 mM YD2 in ethanol.

Figure 6 IPCE spectra of ZnPBAT/TiO2 in 0.15 M LiI/CH3CN. The inset shows the absorption spectrum of 0.02 mM ZnPBAT in
ethanol.

In the cases of YD2 and ZnPBAT
dyes, IPCE increases below 500 nm
according to the increase of the absorbance of the dye molecules between
450 and 500 nm. IPCE is nearly 0.00% above 500 nm, although the absorbances
of YD2 and ZnPBAT give maxima around 650 nm in the absorption spectra.
These results differ from those of ZnP-ref. The coverages of YD2 and
ZnPBAT may be lower than those of ZnP-ref on well-defined TiO2 surfaces because of the large steric hindrance, resulting
in zero IPCE, at which the absorbance of the dyes is lower.

The structural effects of the substrate on IPCE are summarized
as follows      All of the ZnP’s examined
give the
highest IPCE on the TiO2(111) surface. IPCE depends on
the coverage as well as orientation of the dye molecules remarkably;
we estimated the relative coverage of the dye molecules using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We tried to determine the orientation
of the dye molecules using STM; however, the dye molecules could not
be imaged clearly. We could not find the height difference of the
surface before and after the dye adsorption either. This fact indicates
that the dyes may be adsorbed uniformly on well-defined TiO2 surfaces without the formation of island-like structures. Thus,
we predict the orientation of dye molecules using DFT calculations.

The relative coverages of ZnP’s on TiO2(hkl) are estimated using the ratio of integrated XPS peak
intensity of Zn 2p 3/2 to that of Ti 2p 3/2 (I(Zn
2p 3/2)/I(Ti 2p 3/2)). Neither the absolute coverages
nor the amount of the dyes can be obtained using XPS because XPS signals
from Zn and Ti are attenuated by carbon atoms in the dyes. The dye
molecules examined contain different number of carbon atoms; thus,
the degree of the attenuation of XPS signals cannot be estimated exactly.
That is why we calculated relative coverages. Figure 7 shows the value of I(Zn
2p 3/2)/I(Ti 2p 3/2) normalized to that on TiO2(100). All of the dyes give the following order of relative
coverages: TiO2(111) < TiO2(110) < TiO2(100). This tendency agrees with the previous reports that
the (100) facet of the anatase TiO2 nanoparticle adsorbs
more dyes because the (100) facet has higher density of adsorption
sites (5-coordinated Ti atom).40−42 Hard sphere models of rutile
TiO2 single-crystal surfaces (Figure 8) show that the density of 5-coordinated
Ti atoms increases in the following order: TiO2(111) <
TiO2(110) < TiO2(100). Rutile TiO2(100) surface uptakes more ZnP dyes as is the case of the anatase
TiO2(100) facet. However, the order of the relative coverage
of ZnP dyes is completely opposite to that of IPCE. Aggregation of
ZnP dyes quenches the excited state, giving lower η and IPCE
on TiO2 nanoparticles with irregular shapes.31,32 Lower IPCE on ZnP-ref/TiO2(100) might be due to the higher
coverage of the dye on TiO2(100). However, in the cases
of YD2 and ZnPBAT, the values of IPCE on TiO2(100) are
higher than those on TiO2(110), although the coverages
on TiO2(100) are higher than those on TiO2(110).
These facts indicate that the other factors, such as orientation of
the dye, may affect the IPCE remarkably.

TiO2 (top
view).

ZnP dyes are known to be adsorbed
on the TiO2 surface
via carboxyl group (−COO–).43 The ZnP dyes examined have one carboxyl group; thus, it
is probable that the tilt angle of ZnP dyes changes on the TiO2 surface easily.

Figure 9a shows
the stabilization energy of ZnP-ref on TiO2 single-crystal
surface plotted against the tilt angle, which is defined as the angle
between the surface and molecular axis, as shown in Figure 10. ZnP-ref has minimum stabilization
energy at tilt angles of 110 and 90° on TiO2(100)
and TiO2(110), respectively. However, the energy curve
on TiO2(111) gives a shallow potential minimum, showing
that the molecular axis of ZnP-ref can be fluctuated between 70 and
110° almost freely, as shown in Figure 10. The vertical adsorption geometry of the
dye on TiO2(110) contradicts the report that the adsorbed
dye molecules are tilted on TiO2 nanoparticles, the shapes
of which are not controlled.18,19 However, the geometry
and the adsorption sites of adsorbates strongly depend on the structures
of well-defined surfaces.
For example, the sulfate/bisulfate anion is adsorbed in three-fold
geometry on Pt(111),44,45 whereas the anion is adsorbed
in two-fold geometry on Pt(100) and Pt(110).46−48 The surface
structure of Pt affects the superstructure and adsorption site of
CO remarkably.49−51 Cobalt(II) phthalocyanine gives an ordered layer
on the unreconstructed Au(100) (1 × 1) structure; however, the
ordered structure is not found on the reconstructed Au(100)-hex structure.52 It is probable that the adsorption angles of
ZnP dyes on a well-defined TiO2 surface differ from those
on TiO2 nanoparticles, the shapes of which are uncontrolled.
We did not take interaction between dye molecules because the models
are too large to be calculated using Gaussian 09. However, the results
will indicate the tendency of the orientation of an adsorbed dye.

Figure 10 Adsorption models of ZnP on the low-index planes of TiO2.

The porphyrin ring of ZnP-ref
approaches the TiO2(111)
surface when it is tilted, enhancing the rate of electron transfer
from the porphyrin ring to the TiO2 surface through space.
However, on TiO2(110), the distance between the porphyrin
ring and the TiO2(110) surface is farther because ZnP-ref
is adsorbed vertically (Figure 10). Electron transfer via the spacer connecting the
porphyrin ring and the carboxyl group will be dominant in the vertical
adsorption. The rate of electron injection through space is higher
than that via the spacer, resulting in the higher IPCE on TiO2(111) than that on TiO2(110). On the other hand,
a slower injection rate decreases the coupling between the ZnP-ref
cation and the injected electron; the rate of charge recombination
gets lower, enhancing IPCE on TiO2(110). Lower IPCE on
TiO2(110) indicates that decrease of IPCE due to the slower
injection rate overwhelm the enhancement of IPCE by the slow charge
recombination. The difference between the IPCEs of TiO2(111) and TiO2(110) can be attributed to the distance
between the porphyrin ring and the surface.

The tilt angle of
ZnP-ref is 110° on TiO2(100)
according to DFT calculations. IPCE on TiO2(100) should
be as high as that on TiO2(111) because the distance between
the porphyrin ring and the surface on TiO2(100) is as long
as that on TiO2(111) (Figure 10). However, IPCE of ZnP-ref/TiO2(100) is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of ZnP-ref/TiO2(111). The coverage of ZnP-ref on TiO2(100) is
2.5 times as high as that on TiO2(111). ZnP-ref molecules
may be aggregated due to the high coverage. The excited state of ZnP-ref
is quenched, giving lower IPCE on TiO2(100).

The
stabilization energies of the YD2 and ZnPBAT dyes give a shallow
potential curve between 70 and 100° on TiO2(111) as
is the case of ZnP-ref (Figure 9b,c). Thus, the highest IPCE of ZnP’s on TiO2(111) is attributed to the free fluctuation of the porphyrin ring.
The order of IPCEs of YD2 and ZnPBAT is TiO2(110) <
TiO2(100), whereas ZnP-ref gives the opposite order: TiO2(100) < TiO2(110). On TiO2(100),
the tilt angles of YD2 and ZnPBAT (120°) are larger than that
of ZnP-ref (110°). This larger tilt angle shortens the distance
between the porphyrin ring and the TiO2 surface, accelerating
the rate of electron injection through space compared with that for
ZnP-ref. Although absolute coverage of ZnP’s cannot be obtained
using XPS, the higher IPCE of YD2 and ZnPBAT compared with that of
ZnP-ref on TiO2(100) may show that the coverages of ZnPBAT
and YD2 are lower than those of ZnP-ref on TiO2(100), leading
to smaller aggregation tendency. On TiO2(110), the stabilization
energies of YD2 and ZnPBAT give minima around 80 and 100°, respectively;
YD2 and ZnPBAT are adsorbed almost vertically as is the case of ZnP.
Although we do not know the angle that changes the route of electron
injection from space to spacer, the electrons of YD2 and ZnPBAT are
assumed to be injected via the spacer to TiO2(110). The
spacers connecting the porphyrin ring and the carboxyl group of YD2
and ZnPBAT are longer than those of ZnP; the rates of electron injection
of YD2 and ZnPBAT are lower than those of ZnP. Overlapping of the
orbitals between LUMO on the carboxyl group and TiO2 also
affects the rate of charge recombination. DFT calculations show that
the density of LUMO on the carboxyl group of ZnP-ref is lower than
that of YD2 and ZnPBAT; the rate of charge recombination of ZnP-ref
is lower than that of the other dyes. The lower rate of charge recombination
also enhances the IPCE of ZnP-ref on TiO2(110). The different
order of IPCEs of YD2 and ZnPBAT compared with that of ZnP may be
attributed to a larger tilt angle on TiO2(100), smaller
surface coverage, longer spacer distance, and difference in overlapping
of orbitals.

Determination of the orientation of the adsorbed
dye molecules
is necessary for the elucidation of the origin of the structural effects
of the IPCE as the discussion above is based on the calculations using
simple models. We will carry out high-resolution STM and vibrational
spectroscopy measurements
of the adsorbed dyes on TiO2 single-crystal surfaces in
future.

Conclusions
The IPCE of ZnP dyes depends on the surface
structure of rutile
TiO2 remarkably as follows.      All of the dyes give the highest
IPCE on TiO2(111). The order of relative coverages of the
dyes is as follows: TiO2(111) < TiO2(110)
< TiO2(100), showing that the highest IPCE is not attributed
to the coverage. DFT calculations indicate that the tilt angle of
porphyrin dyes fluctuates almost freely on TiO2(111). The
highest IPCE on TiO2(111) is ascribed to the short distance
between the porphyrin ring and the TiO2 surface when the
dye is tilted: electron transfer between the porphyrin ring and the
TiO2 surface through space is enhanced due to the short
distance.

Experimental Section
Single-crystal wafers of rutile
TiO2 (10 mm × 10
mm, 1 mm thickness) doped with 0.05 wt % Nb were purchased from Furuchi
Kagaku. These wafers were cut to (100), (110), and (111) orientations
within an error of 0.5°. We prepared atomically flat TiO2(hkl) surfaces using the method reported
by Imanishi et al.36,37 TiO2 wafers were chemically
polished in 30 wt % HF solution for 10 h. Then, they were annealed
at 600 °C for 10 h to obtain atomically flat surfaces. TiO2 wafer was attached to a Pt plate using indium–gallium
alloy to make an electric contact.37 The
resistance of Nb-doped TiO2 single crystal was lower than
20 Ω after annealing. We can image the surface structures of
TiO2 using STM, as shown below. Nb-doped TiO2(100) and TiO2(110) give clear (1 × 1) low-energy
electron diffraction spots after the procedure, as shown in Figure S1.38 These
facts suggest
that formation of an insulating Nb oxide layer is negligible. Although
the preparation and cleaning procedures of TiO2 surfaces
differ from those reported previously,23−30 our procedure also gives reproducible results.

The surface
structures of TiO2 were imaged with a scanning
tunneling microscope (STM) (Digital Instruments, NanoScope E) in air.
A tungsten probe was prepared by electrochemical polishing of tungsten
wire.

The relative coverages of the adsorbed dye molecules were
investigated
by XPS. The binding energies of the XPS peaks were calibrated using
the C 1 s peak at 285.0 eV from residual carbon remained on TiO2 surface. XPS spectra were obtained with a Kratos Axis Ultra
spectrometer, with an Al Kα line (1486.6 eV) as the X-ray source.
The emission current and anode voltage are 10 mA and 15.0 kV, respectively.
All of the spectra were measured in 0° (normal) emission geometry.

The ZnP dyes, ZnP-ref,31 ZnPBAT,32 and YD2,33−35 were synthesized according to
the literature. A single crystal of TiO2 was heated at
100 °C for 30 min in air to dry the surface and immersed into
ethanol solution of the dye for 12 h. The concentrations of ZnP-ref,
YD2, and ZnPBAT in ethanol were 0.25, 0.20, and 0.20 mM, respectively.

The dye-modified single-crystal wafer of TiO2 with a
Pt plate was mounted in a holder made of poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene),
with a hole for light irradiation. The counter electrode was a Pt
plate. The structures of the cell and the holder are shown in Figure S2. The electrolyte solution was acetonitrile
containing 0.15 M LiI. Light was irradiated to the dye-modified single-crystal
surface of TiO2 using a Xe lamp (150 W) combined with a
monochromator. IPCE was calculated according to the following formula  where I is the photocurrent, e is
the elementary charge, W is the energy
of incident light, h is the Planck constant, and
ν is the frequency of incident light.

The energy of incident
light was measured using a power meter (OPHIR
PD300-UV-ROHS).

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
were carried out using
Gaussian 09. The basis functions were 6-31G** for H, O, N, and C atoms
and LANL2DZ for Zn and Ti atoms. The B3LYP hybrid function was used
for exchange-correlational functionals. The molecular weights of the
dyes examined are too large to perform DFT calculations using personal
computer; we calculated the stabilization energy of the dye on TiO2 single-crystal surfaces using a simplified model as follows:1. First, the structure
of the dye is
optimized using Gaussian 09.

2. The surface model is a cluster composed
of the first layer of TiO2.

3. The structure-optimized dye is adsorbed
on the surface model. The stabilization energy is calculated by changing
the tilt angle of the dye.
