One
of the challenges in using a bone-spacer to cure infection
is the fabrication of a material that can continuously release required
antibiotics at effective concentrations for at least 4–6 weeks.
Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) impregnated with antibiotics is one
of the popularly used bone-spacer materials. Currently, improved sustained
release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic antibiotics is needed for this
material. Here, hydrophilic vancomycin (VAN) was encapsulated into
calcium citrate (CC) particles and natural rice granules, and hydrophobic
erythromycin (ERY) was encapsulated into ethyl cellulose and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) particles. The four antibiotic-loaded
particles were each incorporated into the PMMA cement. The two unencapsulated
drugs and all four drug-loaded particles distributed well in the obtained
composites. PMMA composited with VAN-loaded CC showed prolonged VAN
release at an effective concentration for more than 40 days, but the
composite possessed lesser compressive strength than the PMMA with
no drug. PMMA composited with unencapsulated ERY showed a better sustainment
of drug release than those composited with encapsulated ERY. VAN elution
from the VAN–CC–PMMA did not significantly affect the
compressive strength of the material, whereas ERY elution from the
ERY–PMMA composite significantly decreased the material’s
mechanical strength.

==== Body
Introduction
Poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) has been used as a bone cement
in joint replacement surgery since 1953.1 At the beginning, the PMMA cement was first used at the junction
between a metal implant and the bone to help securing the implant
in place and lessening the stress at the connection between the implant
and the bone; the material gave an added benefit on releasing antibiotics
to prevent infection.1 Later on, PMMA cement
has also been used as a bone-spacer to temporarily take up the space
where the infected implant has been removed. When used as a bone-spacer,
local delivering of antibiotics becomes a primary role of the material
in addition to providing temporary structure and securing the space.2−7 As the bone-spacer is usually used temporarily and the spacer will
be replaced with the metal implant once the infection has been eradicated,
the spacer material can be less durable and less compression-resistant
than the metal implant. Currently, antibiotic-impregnated PMMA bone-spacers
are usually made in-house by a direct mixing of powdered antibiotics
into the materials prior to the polymerization setting of the cement.8−11 Numerous efforts to prolong the drug release from PMMA bone-spacers
have been reported. Examples include finding antibiotics and cement
formulations that are compatible.9,11 Different
PMMA cements have been compared for their ability to sustain the release
of incorporated antibiotics; this is because cements of different
formulations usually possess different degrees of cross-linking and
homogeneity, which can affect the elution of the incorporated drug.11 Different antibiotics such as tobramycin and
vancomycin (VAN) usually show different elution rates from the same
bone-spacers.9,11 A surfactant has been used to
help blend liquid antibiotics into the PMMA matrix, but usually comes
with the cost of mechanical strength.12 The use of drug carriers such as liposomes,1,13 and
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyvinylpyrrolidone particles,14 to sustain the release of different antibiotics
from PMMA, have been reported. Other antibiotic particulates used
with PMMA bone cement include silver nanoparticles capped with tiopronin,15 gentamycin-loaded chitosan/chitosan derivative
nanoparticles,16,17 and gold nanoparticles.18 Nevertheless, still one of the challenges of
using a bone-spacer to cure infection caused by the bone replacement
is the fabrication of a biocompatible bone-spacer that can continuously
release required antibiotics at an effective concentration for at
least 4–6 weeks.10,19

Here, we have
investigated the uses of four different drug carriers
to help in blending both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics into
PMMA and prolonging the drug elution from the resulted composite cements.
We show here the use of natural rice granule (RG) and calcium citrate
(CC) particles to encapsulate the hydrophilic VAN, the fabrication
of composite cements of PMMA with the two VAN-loaded particles, the
investigation on the distribution of the VAN-loaded particles in the
resulted composite matrixes, the 42-day monitor of drug releases from
the composites, and the study on the effects of those added drugs
over the mechanical strength of the composites. We also show similar
studies on erythromycin (ERY), a hydrophobic antibiotic drug, with
the use of ethyl cellulose (EC) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles as carriers. This report gives a
new perspective on the differences in strategies to prolong the elution
of different antibiotics from the PMMA bone cement, and also some
interesting observations on the differences in the releasing character
between the hydrophilic VAN and the hydrophobic ERY.

Results and Discussion
The hydrophilic VAN was successfully encapsulated into two different
carriers, natural RGs and CC particles. The preparation of VAN-loaded
RG or VAN–RG was carried out using the previously reported
heat expansion method in which RG was incubated in VAN aqueous solution
at 83 °C.21 On the basis of the quantification
of the free drug left in the water medium, the encapsulation process
gave encapsulation efficiency of 70.2 ± 1.5% and the obtained
4.58 ± 0.84 μm granules possessed a VAN loading of 84.9
± 0.3% (Figure 1A). It should be noted here that the encapsulation process did not
change the morphology of the RGs; the shape was still polyhedral of
multipentagonal faces with a similar average diameter to the original
granules (data not shown). Successful encapsulation has also been
confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and IR analyzes of the
product.

Figure 1 Scanning electron microscopic images of drug-loaded particles:
(A) VAN-loaded RGs (VAN–RGs), (B) VAN-loaded CC particles (VAN–CC),
(C) ERY-loaded EC particles (ERY–EC), and (D) ERY-loaded PLGA
particles (ERY–PLGA).

As reported earlier that RG is thermoresponsive, the granules can
expand in an aqueous medium at high temperature and shrink back to
their original size when cool.21 Unlike
the medium, the VAN that had been taken up into the granules during
the heat-induced granule expansion probably bound to the biopolymer
matrix of the RG and could not move out from the granules during the
cool down, resulting in an effective drug encapsulation into the RG.
This speculation is supported by the disappearance of the endothermic
peaks in the TGA profile of the RG (maximum at 298 °C) and that
of the free VAN (broad peak with the maximum at 234 °C), and
an appearance of a new broad peak with the peak maximum at 237 °C
in the profile of VAN-RG (Figure S1A in the Supporting Information). The broad endothermic peak likely represents
various interactions between VAN and RG such as multiple hydrogen
bondings between the two as previously speculated and illustrated.21 IR spectrum of the VAN–RG also shows
characteristic peaks of VAN, for example, a peak at 1638 cm–1 which corresponds to N–H bending, the 1600 and 1498 cm–1 absorption which corresponds to C=C stretching
(in ring), and the peak at 1229 cm–1 which corresponds
to C–O–C stretching (Figure S2A in the Supporting Information).

Encapsulation of VAN into CC
particles was carried out by growing
the CC nanospheres in the presence of VAN. Approximately 554.4 ±
220.3 nm particles were obtained (Figure 1B) with the VAN loading content of only 4.9
± 3.2%. The encapsulation efficiency of the process was 27.9
± 18.3. Encapsulation of VAN into the CC was probably taking
place through the entrapment of the VAN into the CC particles assembled
from calcium and citrate ions. It was likely that ionic interactions between carboxylates in the VAN
and Ca2+ took place. In addition, as the encapsulation
was performed at a very basic pH of more than 8, the phenolic moieties
in the VAN structure should be in the phenolate anion state. The phenolate
could also form an ionic bond with the Ca2+. Nevertheless,
VAN probably could not very well compete with the much smaller citrate
ions during the particle growth; therefore, low encapsulation efficiency
and low loading were observed. It should be noted here that the encapsulation
process was optimized through 10 combinations of citrate, calcium,
VAN ratios (data not shown). Also, pH optimization during the encapsulation
was also carried out (data not shown). We speculate that the aggregation
of the particles and the uneven particle growth probably could cause
wide particle size distribution. Nevertheless, particle size is not
very critical for the application on PMMA cement; the current product
of 554.4 ± 220.3 nm was further used in the PMMA casting.

TGA and IR analyses of the VAN–CC indicate successful encapsulation
of VAN into the particles (Figures S1A and S2B in the Supporting Information). The disappearance of
the endothermic peaks in the TGA profile of CC at 381, 482, and 675
°C and the appearance of peaks at 372, 462, and 678 °C in
the profile of VAN–CC, can be clearly observed, indicating
some new molecular interactions in the VAN–CC particles. The
inorganic nature of the CC correlates well to its endothermic peaks
at higher temperature than 300 °C. With the entrapment of VAN
into CC, the obtained product shows an endothermic peak starting from
270 °C. IR spectrum of the VAN–CC clearly shows characteristic
peaks of VAN and CC, for example, the peak at 3051 cm–1, which corresponds to N–H stretching of the amine group in
the VAN structure, the peak at 1662 cm–1, which
corresponds to N–H bending of VAN, the 1602 and 1425 cm–1 absorptions, which correspond to the antisymmetrical
and symmetrical vibrations of the COO– group of citrates in
the CC.

To encapsulate hydrophobic drug ERY, EC and PLGA were
experimented.
Encapsulation of ERY into the EC particles was successfully carried
out through the self-assembly of the EC and the drug molecules during
the slow change from an ethanol-rich to a water-rich medium. The obtained
ERY–EC of 312.5 ± 55.3 nm (Figure 1C) possesses ERY loading of 58.1 ± 5.3%.
The process gave encapsulation efficiency of 62.8 ± 5.7%. TGA
profile (Figure S1B in the Supporting Information) and IR spectrum (Figure S2C in the Supporting Information) of the particles indicate the presence of ERY
in the particles. The shifts in endothermic peaks in the TGA profile
from 343 °C of the EC and 300 °C of the free ERY to the
broad peak with a maximum at 349 °C of ERY–EC (Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information) imply
some new molecular interactions in the particles. The new molecular
interactions are stronger than the original molecular interactions
in the EC and ERY. In addition, these TGA profiles indicate that the
ERY likely distributed in the EC polymer matrix in the form of a solid
solution, not the core–shell assembly. The IR spectrum of the
ERY–EC (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) shows characteristic peaks of ERY, for example, peaks at 1736 and
1701 cm–1, which correspond to C=O stretching
of ester and C=O stretching of aliphatic ketone of the ERY
structure.

Through the emulsion solvent evaporation technique,
we have also
successfully fabricated ERY–PLGA as spherical particles of
11.2 ± 8.1 μm (Figure 1D) with the drug loading content of 6.0 ± 0.9%.
Encapsulation efficiency of 85.1 ± 13.2% was observed for the
process. TGA profile of the particles (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) supports the presence
of ERY in the particles. The shift in the endothermic peaks from 336
°C of the PLGA and 300 °C of the free ERY to 260 and 556
°C imply some new molecular interactions, likely from the ERY
and the polymer components. The small endothermic peak at 428 °C,
which corresponds to the decomposition of the poly vinyl alcohol (PVA)
component,22,23 can also be observed (Figure
S1B in the Supporting Information). With
no absorption peaks of all the original starting materials’
presence in the profile of the product, it is very likely that the
ERY–PLGA possesses the solid solution character of ERY within
the PLGA–PVA polymer matrix. The IR spectrum of the ERY–PLGA
(Figure S2D in the Supporting Information) also contains characteristic peaks of PVA, for example, peaks at
3331 cm–1, which corresponds to O–H stretching,
peak at 2938 cm–1, which corresponds to C–H
stretching, and the 1746 cm–1 absorption, which
corresponds to C=O stretching.

Particle size, encapsulation
efficiency of the preparation process,
and the drug loading in the four obtained particles are summarized
in Table 1. The four
drug-loaded particles, VAN–RG, VAN–CC, ERY–EC,
and ERY–PLGA, and also the two unencapsulated drugs, VAN and
ERY, were each mixed with the PMMA powder and the mixed powder was
processed into the PMMA cement by mixing with the methyl methacrylate
(MMA) monomer liquid. The formulation was controlled to get the PMMA
pieces at the same drug concentration, and the casting was carried
out to get the product with the same 1 × 1 × 1 cm3 dimension. Under this condition, it should be noted here that, drug
particles with low drug loading were incorporated into the PMMA at
higher masses, comparing to drug particles with higher drug loading.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses indicate good distribution
of VAN, ERY, VAN–RG, VAN–CC, ERY–EC, and ERY–PLGA
in the corresponding PMMA composite matrixes (Figure 2, and also S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). PMMA composites consist of mostly
the 48.1 ± 21.2 μm PMMA preformed microparticles linked
together through the PMMA formed by the polymerization of MMA. The
4.58 ± 0.84 μm VAN–RG particles account for approximately
6.2% (by wt) of the PMMA preformed particles, and the SEM image of
the composite cement agrees well with its content (Figures 2 row C, and S3 and S4 row
C in the Supporting Information). The 554.4
± 220.3 nm VAN–CC particles account for 40.8% (by wt)
of the PMMA particles. The SEM image of VAN–CC–PMMA
shows distribution of a lot of VAN–CC along with the PMMA particles
(Figures 2 row D, and
S3 and S4 row D in the Supporting Information). The 312.5 ± 55.3 nm ERY–EC particles account for approximately
11.0% (by wt) of the PMMA particles and these drug particles can be
observed in the SEM image of the cement (Figures 2 row F, and S3 and S4 row F in the Supporting Information). The 11.2 ± 8.1
μm ERY–PLGA particles account for 8.9% (by wt) of the
PMMA preformed particles; they can also be observed in the SEM image
of the cement (Figures 2 row G, and S3 and S4 row G in the Supporting Information).

To mimic the real biological fluid which is continuously renewed
in the body parts, we used phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as the release
medium6,11,16 and also changed
the release medium into a fresh one every day during the drug release
test. The cement pieces were submerged into the release medium with
constant shaking, and the release medium was quantified for the released
drug. PMMA composited with VAN–RG showed some improvement in
prolonging the effective concentration of the released VAN when compared
to the PMMA that was impregnated with unencapsulated VAN (Figure 3A and also S5A in
the Supporting Information). It should
be noted here that the minimal inhibitory concentration of VAN against Staphylococcus aureus is 2.0 μg/mL.24 Using RG to encapsulate VAN prior to the incorporation
into the cement could extend the effective concentration of VAN in
the released medium from 16 days (observed for the PMMA doped with
unencapsulated VAN) to 19 days. The PMMA composited with VAN–CC
showed much higher VAN release every day, from day 1 to day 42, the
last day of the test period (Figure 3A and also S5A in the Supporting Information). The VAN concentration in the release medium at
day 42 was well above the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values.
The result here agrees with the SEM images that shows many VAN–CC
particles in the composite. Approximately 65% of the VAN in the VAN–CC–PMMA
was released during the 42-day period, comparing to only 15% for the
other two composts (Figure S5A). We speculate
that the significantly higher concentrations of the released drug
observed for the VAN–CC–PMMA were likely caused by the
presence of many micro/nanochannels in the composite matrix, formed
as a result of the alteration of the original PMMA packing because
of the presence of 40.8% (by wt) of the VAN–CC particles in
the composite formulation. These channels allowed the elution of VAN
from deep inside the matrix.

(ERY–EC–PMMA), and ERY-loaded PLGA particles (ERY–PLGA–PMMA).
Averages are shown with the error bar representing standard deviation
from three independent data points.

In contrast to the hydrophilic VAN in which the CC carrier could
significantly increase the concentration of the released VAN at later
days, EC and PLGA carriers used for the encapsulation of the hydrophobic
ERY induced more burst release at the beginning and produced lower
drug release in later days (Figures 3B and S5B). Surprisingly,
PMMA impregnated with unencapsulated ERY showed less burst released
at the beginning and higher concentrations of the released drug at
later days. Even at day 42, the ERY concentration in the release medium
of the ERY–PMMA composite was four times higher than the MIC
of this drug against S. aureus (8 μg/mL).25 Although the total drug released during the
42-day period of the three composites was in close ranges of approximately
80–100% of the total drug presence in the materials at the
beginning, the release from ERY–PMMA was the most steady (Figure
S5B in the Supporting Information).

The result indicates that incorporating unencapsulated hydrophobic
antibiotic ERY into the PMMA can produce bone cement that possesses
good sustained release of the drug. It should be noted here that the
limited solubility of ERY in the release medium (0.60 mg/mL at 37
°C) is not the cause of this sustained release. We speculate
that the hydrophobic ERY probably formed into small particulates that
packed well with the PMMA particles, and the slow erosion of some
ERY particulates at the surface of the matrix then granted access
of the release medium to the ERY further inside the cement pieces.
This process kept going slowly and resulted in the sustained release
of the ERY from the ERY–PMMA. In contrast, because of the water
insolubility of EC and PLGA, release of ERY from the EC or PLGA particles
situated at the surface of the cement did not dissolve the two particles
and, therefore, did not generate further exposure of the drugs inside
the cement piece to the release medium.

The compressive strengths
shown as the maximum stress values of
the tested bone cements are shown in Figure 4 and Table 2. Adding either unencapsulated VAN or VAN–RG
into the PMMA produced no significant difference of the compressive
strength at the 0.05 level of significance. However, VAN–CC
addition produced a significant decrease in the compressive strength.
We speculate that the high amount of VAN–CC (40.8% of PMMA)
was responsible for such effect, noting that the amounts of unencapsulated
VAN and VAN–RG were 5.5 and 6.2% of the PMMA particles, respectively.
More importantly, the VAN–CC–PMMA, which possessed an
excellent drug release character, showed no change in the compressive
strength after drug release. This observation implies that the CC
particles were probably not eluted out along with the drug.

and after the 42-day-release test. Significant differences between
the tested groups are denoted with *, **, and *** for level of certainty

Adding unencapsulated ERY into the PMMA produced no significant
difference of the compressive strength as compared to the PMMA control
piece (no drug). However, among the three ERY-containing composites,
only ERY–PMMA, the composite with the best ERY release character,
showed a significant decrease in compressive strength when the drug
was eluted. Our explanation is as follows. As mentioned above, the
ERY particulates distributed in the polymer matrix were eroded during
the drug release and the erosion of the outer drug particulates likely
granted contact of release medium to the ERY situated inside the piece,
thus allowing further erosion of more drug particulates. These erosions
probably resulted in void spaces in the polymer composite, which weakened
the mechanical strength of the cement piece. In contrast, when the
drug carrier EC or PLGA was used, the release of the drug did not
affect the mechanical strength of the materials. This implies that
during the drug release, the carriers were probably retained in the
composites, serving as the filler materials. It should be noted here
that the minimum compressive strength for implanted acrylic cement
is around 70 MPa.26 After 42-day release,
the VAN–CC–PMMA cement possessed a compressive strength
of around 70 MPa, whereas that of ERY–PMMA was around 62 MPa.
Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the amount of drug added
into the PMMA could be adjusted as the concentration in the released
media at day 42 was still much higher than the MIC values of the two
drugs against S. aureus.

Conclusions
In order to make bone cement with prolonged drug release character,
two points need to be considered, (1) ability of the cement to sustain
the drug release and (2) ability of the cement to allow the drug located
inside the cement to move out. Here, we have observed that the hydrophobic
antibiotic ERY does not require any encapsulation prior to its incorporation
into the PMMA cement to sustain the drug release and to mediate the
drug inside the cement to move out. Unencapsulated ERY-doped PMMA
cement showed that 85% of the drug molecules could steadily move out
during the 42-day period with minimal burst at the beginning. In contrast,
the cements incorporated with either ERY–PLGA or ERY–EC
produced larger burst release during the first week and much lower
drug concentrations at later days. Although the unencapsulated ERY
possesses good release character from PMMA on its own, the hydrophilic
VAN requires encapsulation into the right carriers prior to the incorporation
into the cement. The PMMA incorporated with unencapsulated VAN or
the VAN encapsulation into RGs showed burst release during the first
2–3 days, and only 18% of the incorporated drug could be released
out from the cements during the 42-day period. Although the PMMA incorporated
with the VAN that had been encapsulated in CC produced burst release
at the beginning, VAN release at the concentration above the MIC value
against S. aureus could still be obtained
during the later days of the 42-day period because of the ability
of the drug to not be trapped inside the PMMA cement matrix, that
is, 70% of the incorporated drug was released from the cement during
the 42-day period when VAN–CC was used. Further investigations
are needed to clarify whether the discrepancy between the hydrophobic
ERY and the hydrophilic VAN will also hold for other hydrophobic and
hydrophilic drugs. Both the VAN–CC PMMA and the ERY–PMMA
showed a similar drop in compressive strength as compared to the undoped
PMMA.

Materials and Methods
Drug Encapsulation
VAN-Loaded RGs
VAN (400 mg, Hunan HuiBaiShi Biotechnology
Co., Ltd, Hunan, China) was dissolved in water (20 mL), and RG (50
mg, Thai Wah Public Company Limited, Thailand) was added. This mixture
was stirred at room temperature (30 °C) for 30 min and then at
83 °C for 3 h. The mixture was cooled and kept at room temperature
overnight. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 2350g for 30 min. The pelleted down VAN-loaded RGs (VAN–RGs)
were freeze-dried. Encapsulation efficiency of the process [% EE =
(weight of drug being encapsulated/weight of drug originally used)
× 100] and drug loading content of the obtained particles [%
loading = (weight of drug being encapsulated/weight of drug-loaded
particles) × 100] were determined by quantifying VAN in the supernatant
(corresponded to unencapsulated drug), using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer
at 283 nm with the aid of the calibration standards.

VAN-Loaded
CC Particles
VAN solution (200 mg in 2 mL
of water) and calcium chloride (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) solution
(760 mg in 2 mL of water) were mixed and trisodium citrate (2020 mg
in 6 mL) was added and the mixture was vortexed for 5 min. The mixture
was then continuously shaken (in an incubator shaker) at room temperature
for 24 h. Then, sodium hydroxide (3.31 mg) was added into the suspension
to reduce the solubility of VAN20 and shaking
was continued for another 24 h. The resulting suspension was then
left at 4 °C for 5 days. The resulting suspension was centrifuged
at 9400g for 30 min. The pelleted down VAN-loaded
CC (VAN–CC) particles were freeze-dried. Encapsulation efficiency
of the process and drug loading content of the obtained particle were
determined as described above.

ERY-Loaded EC Particles
First, the polymer–drug
solution was prepared by dissolving EC (40 mg, viscosity 300 cP for
the 5% in toluene/ethanol 80:20, 48% ethoxyl content, Sigma-Aldrich)
and ERY (40 mg, Greenway Biotech Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) in ethanol
(16 mL). Then, water (64 mL) was slowly added dropwise at a controlled
rate (1.13 mL/min), under constant stirring. After that, the suspension
was stirred under vacuum to evaporate ethanol. The resulting suspension
was centrifuged at 15900g for 45 min. The pelleted
down ERY-loaded EC (ERY–EC) particles were freeze-dried. Encapsulation
efficiency of the process and drug loading content of the obtained
particle were determined by (1) evaporating the supernatant, (2) dissolving
ERY in the residue with dichloromethane, (3) quantifying ERY in the
obtained solution using UV–visible absorption spectrophotometry
at the maximum absorption wavelength of ERY of 296 nm with the aid
of calibration ERY standards prepared in dichloromethane, and (4)
calculating for the %EE and %drug loading content as defined above.

ERY-Loaded PLGA Particles
ERY (40 mg) and PLGA (40
mg, ratio of lactic acid to glycolic acid of 50:50, Mw of 13 000–23 000, 87–89%
hydrolyzed, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to dichloromethane (5 mL) and
stirred. An aqueous solution of PVA [20 mL of water and 1.0 g of PVA
(Mw 31 000–50 000,
87–89% hydrolyzed, Sigma-Aldrich)] was added and the mixture
was sonicated for 1 min. This emulsion was stirred under vacuum to
evaporate dichloromethane. The resulting suspension was centrifuged
at 15 900g for 45 min. The pelleted down ERY-loaded
PLGA (ERY–PLGA) particles were freeze-dried. Encapsulation
efficiency of the process and drug loading content of the obtained
particles were determined by (1) evaporating the supernatant, (2)
dissolving ERY in the residue with ethanol, (3) quantifying ERY in
the obtained ethanolic solution using UV–visible absorption
spectrophotometry at the maximum absorption wavelength of ERY of 289
nm with the aid of calibration ERY standards prepared in ethanol,
and (4) calculating for the % EE and % drug loading content as defined
above.

All four drug-loaded particles were subjected to scanning
electron microscopic (JSM-7610, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), infrared spectroscopic
(ATR-IR Nicolet 6700, Thermo Electron Corporation, Madison, WI, USA),
and thermal gravimetric (Netzsch STA 449 F1, Germany) analyses.

PMMA Cement Casting
The PMMA cement was prepared using
the PALACOS bone cement kit (Richards, Memphis, Tennessee, USA). For
the undoped cement, PMMA powder (1.0 g) was mixed with the MMA liquid
monomer (0.5 mL). The mixture was poured into silicone molds with
1 × 1 × 1 cm3 dimension and left at room temperature
overnight to obtain the control PMMA cement pieces. PMMA composite
pieces were prepared similarly, except that unencapsulated drug or
encapsulated drug was first mixed with the PMMA powder. Six PMMA composites
were prepared at the same drug content in the cement.

The drug-incorporated
PMMA cements were prepared with unencapsulated drugs and various encapsulated
drugs at the same fixed amount of final drug concentration. The dry
drug powder or the dry drug-loaded particles were each mixed with
the PMMA powder homogeneously. Amounts of drug or drug-loaded particles
mixed with 1.0 g of PMMA powder were as follows: 55 mg of VAN, 55
mg of ERY, 62 mg of VAN–RG (containing 55 mg VAN), 408 mg of
VAN–CC (containing 55 mg VAN), 110 mg of ERY–EC (containing
55 mg ERY), and 89 mg of ERY–PLGA (containing 55 mg of ERY).
Then, each mixture was mixed with the MMA liquid monomer (0.5 mL).
The reaction was exothermic and the hot mixture (around 70–100
°C) was poured into the silicone molds with 1 × 1 ×
1 cm3 dimension and left at room temperature overnight
to obtain the antibiotics-impregnated bone cement pieces.

The
obtained cement pieces were subjected to SEM analysis, compressive
strength measurement (UTM, LR10K, LLOYD Instrument, England), and
drug release tests.

Drug Release
In a plastic tube with
a screw cap, the
tested cement piece was submerged in 20 mL of the release medium,
which is PBS (pH 7.4, 0.01 M phosphate, 0.137 M NaCl, 0.002 M KCl).
The closed tube was incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking
using a WNE 14 Water Bath with an M00 Shaker. Every day, each bone-spacer
was removed from the tube and put into another tube containing 20
mL of fresh PBS. The experiment was carried out in triplicate for
6 weeks. The release medium in the previous tube was subjected to
drug quantification using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry
using the maximum absorption of VAN and ERY (in PBS) at 283 and 210
nm, respectively. Calibration standards were prepared in PBS.

Mechanical
Properties
Measurement was carried out using
the universal testing machine (UTM, LR10K, LLOYD Instrument, England).
Protocol according to the ASTM standard was followed with modification
on PMMA cement dimension.26 The casted
PMMA composites were dried in a desiccator overnight and analyzed
using the compressor with a diameter of 6 mm and the compressive force
of 10 kN at the constant cross-head speed of 20.0 mm/min. Measurement
was stopped when the sample was fractured or passed the upper yield
point.

Statistical Evaluation
All results were expressed as
the mean value ± standard deviation (SD) of at least three independent
samples. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate
the differences between the tested groups.
