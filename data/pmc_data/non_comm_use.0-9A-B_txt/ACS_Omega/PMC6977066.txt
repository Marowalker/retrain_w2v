The
swirling flow technology is adopted on a nozzle of the spouted
bed in order to enhance the radial movement of the particles. The
hydrodynamic characteristics in a spouted bed with a swirling flow
generator installed on the nozzle are numerically investigated based
on the two-fluid model (TFM). The traditional spouted bed and spouted
bed with an integral swirling blade nozzle (ISBN) are simulated and
analyzed. Numerical results show that the dead zone at the cone region
of the annulus can be effectively eliminated by using the ISBN. The
maximum decrease in particle concentration near the cone region is
72%, and the ISBN structure can significantly improve the comprehensive
fluidization degree of the spouted bed when γ equals 86°.
The turbulent kinetic energy of gas can be significantly increased
by the swirling flow along the radial direction in the spouted bed,
especially in the spout region. Also, the swirling flow can promote
the radial velocity and granular temperature of the particles in the
spouted bed, which is helpful to the radial mixing of particles and
gas phase between the central spout and the annulus in the spouted
bed. There exists a value of ξ (equals 0.526), which brings
the greatest elimination effect of the flow dead zone in the annulus
of the limited spouted bed space, and the overall fluidization of
the spouted bed has the best performance when ξ = 0.316.

1 Introduction
Spouted bed techniques
are highly attractive for drying, mixing,
granulation, and coating.1−8 Many investigations on hydrodynamics of spouted beds have been reported
in the literature. Takeuchi et al.2 has
studied the effects of pulse frequency and slot size on the hydrodynamics
and particle motion of sawdust with an average diameter of 1.29 mm
by an experimental method. Rao et al.3 studied
the pressure fluctuations generated by the use of dense zirconia particles
in a three-dimensional (3D) spouted bed through a high-intensity microphone.
They also studied the influence of gas velocity and static bed height
on the hydrodynamics of the spouted bed. Devahastin et al.4 developed a rotary jet annular spouted bed dryer
for the drying of particles in the deceleration period. Du et al.5 built a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) model
of the spouted bed to evaluate the correlation of drag coefficient.
Haghnegahdar et al.6 experimentally investigated
the performance of a powder-particle spouted bed for carbon dioxide
removal. The hydrodynamic characteristics of spouted beds under a
wide range of operating parameters have been investigated by Du et
al.7 Saldarriaga et al.8 carried out an experimental study on the minimum spouting
velocity for the spouted beds of plant waste biomaterials. Recently,
the flow behavior of ultrafine powders in the spouted bed with coarse
particles was numerically studied by Sun et al.9 Zhang et al.10 experimentally
studied the gas–solid two-phase flow of silicon particles with
a wide scale distribution in a draft tube spouted bed. Wu et al.11−14 studied flow behaviors of gas and particles in three kinds of spouted
beds recently: without disturbance units, with a pair of balls and
with a pair of longitudinal vortex generators (LVGs). The effect of
LVGs’ row number on the hydrodynamic behaviors in the spouted
bed is also numerically analyzed. Savari et al.15 studied the influence of particle size, particle density,
inlet diameter, and static bed height on the operation stability of
the conical spouted bed by analyzing the pressure fluctuation information
entropy. Estiati et al.16 investigated
the effects of the geometry and structure of the restrictor and the
guide pipe on the entrainment, operating pressure drop, operating
air volume, and maximum cycle time. Also, Golshan et al.17 proposed a new hybrid deterministic–stochastic
model and applied it to the simulation of a slot-rectangular spouted
bed to reduce the calculation cost.

To overcome the shortcomings
of the dead zone at the cone region
of the annulus and improve the hydrodynamic behavior in the spouted
bed or fluidized beds, the fluidized gas is introduced through bypass
air around the central nozzle. A half-column spouted bed with auxiliary
flow was experimentally studied by Sutanto et al.18 Four different flow patterns are determined and plotted:
spouting with aeration, fixed bed, jet in a fluidized bed, and spout-fluidization.
Zhao et al.19 found that more uniform axial
temperature distribution can be obtained by adding auxiliary air along
the cone base of the spouted fluidized bed. Arnold et al.20 introduced a kind of gasification technology
of a spouted fluidized bed used by the British Coal Corporation to
produce low calorific value fuel gas. Through the experimental investigation
of the flow behaviors in the cylindrical spout-fluid bed, Pianarosa
et al.21 found that the particle velocity
in the spout was somewhat decreased and the net solid circulation
rate was slightly decreased due to the auxiliary air. Zhong et al.22−24 obtained a time series of differential pressure fluctuations at
different positions in a 2D spouted fluidized bed with a cross section
of 300 × 30 mm and a height of 2000 mm and investigated the influence
of two operating parameters, fluidizing gas flow rate and spouting
gas velocity, on the Shannon entropy. Wang et al.25 discovered the flow patterns in the spouted fluidized bed
by numerical study of hydrodynamics based on the Euler–Eulerian
method with kinetic theory for granular flow. It is found that the
porosity and particle concentration of the gas–solid spouted
fluidized bed are significantly affected by the gas incident angle
and gas flow rate. Nagashima et al.26 used
the same semicircle column and the same particles to carry out the
experimental research and compared the influence of operating parameters
on the flow behaviors of the spouted fluidized bed (SFB) and SFB with
a draft tube in the bed. Sutkar et al.27 put forward a fresh CFD–DEM (discrete element method) model
for the coupling of heat transfer in a spouted fluidized bed. The
recently developed recurrence CFD (rCFD) method has been applied in
the laboratory-scale 3D spouted bed device for spray coating by Kieckhefen
et al.28 Monazam et al.29,30 carried out an experimental study on the pressure drop and related
apparent gas velocity in a flat-bed spouted bed with or without fluidization,
and the characteristics of cylindrical spouted fluidized beds of different
static heights and two materials were also investigated. Other studies
on particle motion enhancement by pulsating flow in spouted beds can
be found in refs (3)(30), and (31). Devahastin et al.31 experimentally investigated the gas–solid
two-phase flow of the pulsed spouted bed dryers. Bizhaem et al.32 experimentally and numerically studied the hydrodynamic
behavior in a pulsed fluidized bed. They investigated the influence
of pulsating flow with frequencies from 1 to 10 Hz for particle sizes
of Geldart B and A/B group with varying particle densities. Saidi
et al.33 numerically investigated the influence
of the fluidizing and jetting pulsation on particle movement in the
spouted fluidized bed by coupling Navier–Stokes gas-phase equations
and discrete element method. They found that, with an increase in
fluidization rate, the dead zones diminished.

All of the previous
studies have shown that the hydrodynamic behavior
in the auxiliary gas spouted fluidized bed with cone base still needs
to be studied. Moreover, at present, there have been no research reports
about the swirling flow effect on the enhancement of the gas–solid
flow in the spouted bed. The focus of the current work is to design
and develop an efficient, integral, and controllable nozzle installed
with a swirling flow generator to enhance and optimize the gas–solid
flow process in the spouted bed. In order to utilize cylindrical spouted
beds more effectively in industrial application, such as drying of
granular material34,35 and heat transfer of fluidized
bed,36 a swirling flow generator installed
on the nozzle is adopted to improve the radial contact between gas
and solid phases in the spout and annulus of the spouted bed. In the
work reported herein, three-dimensional hydrodynamic behaviors of
a spouted bed under the action of swirling flow were numerically studied,
the Gidaspow drag model37 is selected to
describe the momentum exchange of the interface, and the two-fluid
model is used. The physical models and mathematical formulations of
the gas and particle two phase in the spouted bed are given. The hydrodynamic
characteristic of gas and particles in a conventional spouted bed
was compared to that in a spouted bed with the ISBN, and detailed
analyses were carried out. In addition, the effects of the inclination
angle of swirl blade (γ) and the internal/external radius ratio
of the ISBN (ξ) on the hydrodynamic behavior in the spouted
bed are studied.

2 Computational Models
2.1 CFD Model
Simulation of hydrodynamic
behaviors in the spouted bed by the Euler–Eulerian two-fluid
model and both the gas and particles are regarded as an interpenetrating
continuous phase. Flow behavior is described by generalized Navier–Stokes
(N–S) equations,38 and the viscous
forces and solid phase pressure are described by a function of particle
temperature.39 The Schaeffer model40 is used to represent the stress of solid phase,
and the Gidaspow model37 is used to describe
the diffusion coefficient of the particle energy. The governing equation
and constitutive relation of the spouted bed are shown are shown in
ref (11).

The Eulerian approach is adopted for both gas and solid phases
in spouted beds. The dispersed turbulence model has been used, in
which turbulence predictions for gas are gained by the standard k–ω41 model. The
equations of k–ω turbulence model are
shown in ref (11).
The velocity of the particle phase between numerical simulation results
(through the standard k–ω turbulence
model) and the experimental results has been compared by Wu et al.11 Therefore, the standard k–ω
turbulence model is used for simulations of this work. The numerical
model of the conventional spouted bed was verified by the experimental
results of the cone base cylindrical spouted bed of He et al.42,43 The numerical model of spouted beds with an ISBN are displayed in Figures 1 and 2. The structural parameters of spouted beds for the present
calculation are listed in Table 2, and the boundary conditions are shown in Table 3.

2.2 Solution
Method of Equations
The
set of governing equations given in section 2.1 are solved by CFD code Fluent 15. The
phase-coupled PC-SIMPLE algorithm was adopted for the pressure–velocity
coupling. The second-order upwind scheme is used for other equations.
The transient simulation is carried out with a constant time step
of 1 × 10–5 s. The convergence criterions are
that the residuals of all variables such as velocity are less than
1 × 10–3. The geometry, shapes, and grid description
of spouted beds with the ISBN are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Computational
domain was discretized by tetrahedral grids in the ISBN part and cylindrical
grids by the cylindrical and column cone parts (Figure 2b). Through the grid independence test of
the spouted bed without disturbance units (case A), as shown in Figure 3, it can be found
that a grid number of 452,452 is fine enough to ensure the grid-independent
solution. Thus, in case A of this study, the grid number is set to
452,452. The hydrodynamic behavior in the three-dimensional spouted
bed (case A) was solved and compared with the experimental curve of
particle velocity42,43 as shown by Wu et al.,11 and we believe that the code is correct and
can be adopted to simulate the hydrodynamics of the spouted bed with
an ISBN. In addition, the swirl number calculated in this paper is
defined as , where w and u are the tangential and axial velocity at
corresponding radial position r, respectively, and R is the outer radius
of the annulus; the range of the swirl number in this paper is 0.0738–2.4134.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Particle Volume Fraction
In order
to investigate the influence of swirling flow of the inlet gas and
the inclination angle of the swirl blade (γ) on the hydrodynamic
behavior in the spouted bed, the inlet angle of the swirl blade, the
ratio of the internal radius to external radius of the ISBN, and the
number of swirling blades are all kept constant as β = 45°
(Figure 2) and ξ
= 0.526 and 8 (Table 1), respectively. Meanwhile, the inclination angles of the swirl blade
(γ) in the spouted bed with an ISBN for case B, case C, and
case D are 86°, 80°, and 76°, respectively. Figure 4 illustrates the
comparison of particle volume fractions in case A–case D with
an inlet gas velocity of 0.864 m/s in a stable state (U = 1.6Ums). It can be observed from the
figure that when the ISBN is used in the spouted bed, the energy dissipation
increases due to the swirling flow of gases, resulting in the decrease
in fountain height; when the particle volume fraction redistributes
in spouted beds, the particles’ fountain region becomes flat.
Close to the fountain area, aggregation and bubbling of gas occurred
in the spouted bed due to the gas swirling diversion of the cone and
convergence near the spout. Also, the range of particle fountain in
spouted beds with an ISBN has been expanded. It can be seen in Figure 3 that a stable three-zone
spouting structure can still be maintained in the spouted bed with
the ISBN equipment, whereas the ISBN can only destroy the flow dead
zone in column cones in the spouted bed.

Figure 4 Comparison of the particle
concentration in the spouted bed with
different values of γ. (a) Case A. (b) Case B. (c) Case C. (d)
Case D.

Figure 5 compares
the particle concentrations on different cross sections of the spouted
bed in case A and case B for U = 1.6Ums. It can be observed in Figure 4 that the value of particle concentration
near the annulus region can be reduced by the ISBN at a low height
of the spouted bed (column cones). Compared to the conventional spouted
bed (case A), the scope of particle aggregation in the cone region
for case B significantly decreases under ISBN effects (Figure 4b). However, at high levels
of the spouted bed in the annulus, the swirling influence of gas on
the particle distribution is not obvious, revealing that the ISBN
has an obvious impact on the radial distribution of the particles
and the value of particle concentrations near the cone region in the
spouted bed can be most effectively reduced. Therefore, the dead zone
at the cone region of the annulus of the spouted bed can be eliminated
effectively.

Figure 5 Comparison of particle concentrations in the cross section
of the
spouted bed at different heights (case A and case B). (a) z = 0.05 m. (b) z = 0.1 m. (c) z = 0.15
m.

The particle volume fraction profile
along the radial direction
in case A–case D for U = 1.6Ums is shown in Figure 6. Due to the emergence of the radial swirling flow
of the gas phase in the spouted bed, the particle concentration near
the annulus, especially near the cone region, decreases obviously.
The maximum decrease in particle concentration near the cone region
is 72%, and the largest reduction of particle concentration in the
annulus is found in case B (γ = 86°) among four kinds of
spouted beds. Figure 7 shows the particle volume fraction profile along the central axial
direction in case A–case D. It can be observed that the distribution
of particle concentration along the axis of the spouted bed has been
adjusted. The ISBN along the axial direction can obviously intensify
the value of particle volume fraction near the spout of the spouted
bed, and the maximum increase in particle concentration near the spout
is 195% in the spouted bed with the effect of swirling flow when γ
= 76° (case D). Overall, because of the swirling flow effect
of the gas phase, the axial particle aggregation area in the spouted
bed moves toward the fountain area.

different values of γ. (a) z = 0.05 m. (b) z = 0.1 m. (c) z = 0.15 m.

different values of γ.

3.2 Hydrodynamic Behaviors
Figure 8 displays the radial velocity
profile of particles along the radial direction at different heights
of the spouted bed for case A–case D. It can be clearly seen
that the radial velocity of particles is significantly enhanced by
the ISBN in the cone region, and this effect increases with increasing
the inclination angle of swirl blade γ. When γ = 86°
(case B), the radial velocity of the particle phase is increased in
both the cone and the spout region. Also, the degree of enhancement
for particles’ radial velocity by the ISBN decreases with increasing
the height of spouted bed (z), which reveals that
the swirling effect of gas on the particles in the spouted bed cone
region leads to a large energy dissipation of the gas phase flow at
the low bed level of the spouted bed, thus resulting in a sharp decrease
in the swirling effect of gas on particles in the high bed region.
The effect of the ISBN on the magnitude of velocities of particles
along the axial direction at different heights of the spouted bed
for case A–case D is shown in Figure 9. Compared with case A, the velocity of the
particle phase along the axial direction in the spouted bed decreases
because of the swirling influence of imported gas. Due to the existence
of the ISBN, the inlet gas has a flow diversion effect in the annular
of the spouted bed, which reduces both the gas flow flux in the spout
and the magnitude of particles’ velocities along the axis direction
of the spouted bed. Also, the velocities of particles increase with
the increase in γ for the spouted bed with an ISBN. When γ
= 86°, the velocities of particles along the axial direction
of the spouted bed reach the highest value.

of particles in the spouted bed under
different γ values. (a) z = 0.05 m. (b) z = 0.1 m. (c) z = 0.15 m.

Figure 9 Axial velocity distribution of particles in the spouted bed with
different values of γ.

Figures 10 and 11 show the comparison of turbulent kinetic energy
of gas for different values of γ. Compared with the conventional
spouted bed, the ISBN can significantly enhance both the magnitude
and range of turbulent kinetic energy of gas, especially in the column
cone region, which is helpful to promote the radial movement between
the particle and gas phases in the spouted bed. As a result, the flow
dead zone in the annulus of the spouted bed can be eliminated effectively
by the ISBN. The pressure drop in spouted beds is displayed in Figure 12 for different
values of γ. It can be seen that the pressure drop in spouted
beds increases because of the inner device of the ISBN. Compared with
case A, the maximum increase in pressure drop in spouted beds is 40.7%
for case D, which reveals that the dissipation of gas swirling flow
can increase the pressure drop of the spouted bed to a certain extent.

Figure 12 Pressure drop in spouted beds for different
values of γ.

The uniformity of particles’
distribution is analyzed by
the coefficient of variation (CV) of particle concentration as follows 1   2  where S is
the standard deviation, εsj is the
particle volume fraction of the sampling point, εs® is the average particle volume fraction of all sampling points,
and n is the number of samples, which equals the
total number of grid cells in the spouted bed. The definition of the
dimensionless particle flow factor η is as follows 3  where ΔP is the pressure drop
in the spouted bed with an ISBN, and ΔPN = 0 is the pressure
drop in the conventional spouted bed.

Figure 13 shows
the comparison of η in spouted beds for different values of
γ. It is seen that η fluctuates with the increase in γ.
When γ equals 86° (case B), η has a minimum value.
It can be revealed that, compared with the conventional spouted bed,
the ISBN structure can significantly improve the comprehensive fluidization
quality for the spouted bed with a slight increase in the pressure
drop. When the swirling of the gas phase angle is set properly, the
inlet gas can make the best fluidization influence on the particle
flow in the spouted bed.

values of γ.

3.3 Influence
of the Internal/External Radius
Ratio of the ISBN
In order to investigate the effect of the
ratio of the internal radius to external radius of the ISBN (ξ
= D2/D1) on
hydrodynamic behaviors in the spouted bed, the inclination angle of
the swirl blade and the external radius of the ISBN are kept constant
as γ = 86° and D1 = 19 mm.
Five nozzles with different internal radii (D2) of 6 mm (ξ = 0.316), 8 mm (ξ = 0.521), 10 mm
(ξ = 0.526), 12 mm (ξ = 0.632), and 14 mm (ξ = 0.737)
are studied for the spouted bed with an ISBN. Figure 14 shows the effect of ξ on the particle
concentration profile along the radial direction in four kinds of
spouted beds at different heights for U = 1.6Ums. It can be seen that, when ξ = 0.526,
the particle concentration near the annulus region is the lowest,
which indicates that there exists a value of ξ (0.526), which
can best eliminate the flow dead zone of the annular region in the
limited spouted bed space. Accordingly, the pressure drop in spouted
beds increases when adding the swirl blade in the nozzle, and it reaches
the maximum value when ξ equals 0.526 (Figure 15), which reveals that the greater the degree
of damage to the flow dead zone in the annulus region, the larger
the energy consumption of gas in spouted beds.

distribution in the spouted bed with
different values of ξ. (a) z = 0.05 m. (b) z = 0.1 m. (c) z = 0.15 m.

Figure 15 Pressure drop in spouted beds for different values of ξ.

To determine the comprehensive fluidization effect
of the spouted
bed with an ISBN, the comparison of η in spouted beds for different
values of ξ was analyzed. As shown in Figure 16, it is noteworthy that the optimal overall
fluidization quality of the spouted bed occurs when ξ equals
0.316 rather than 0.526, although the fluidization effect of the gas
swirl flow on the particles’ dead zone in the spouted bed is
the best when ξ equals 0.526. Therefore, an appropriate increase
in the cross-sectional area of the swirling channel is beneficial
to the enhancement of the overall fluidization quality of the spouted
bed with an ISBN.

of ξ.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, three-dimensional gas–particle flow in a
novel spouted bed structure with the swirling flow effects was numerically
investigated. The effect of the inclination angle of the swirl blade
(γ) and the internal/external radius ratio of the ISBN (ξ)
on hydrodynamic characteristics in spouted beds has been discussed.
The main conclusions are presented as follows:(1) When the ISBN is used in the spouted
bed, an increasing energy dissipation due to swirling flow of gases
causes the height of the fountain to decrease, and the value of particle
concentration near the annulus can be reduced by the ISBN at low heights
of the spouted bed (column cones). Compared with the conventional
spouted bed, the maximum decrease in particle concentration near the
cone is 72%, and the ISBN structure can significantly improve the
comprehensive fluidization quality of the spouted bed when γ
equals 86°.

(2) The
radial velocity of particles can
be enhanced significantly by the ISBN in the cone region, and the
improvement effect of the ISBN on the radial velocity of particles
increases with the increase in inclination angle of the swirl blade
γ. The turbulent kinetic energy of gas in the spouted bed can
be enhanced significantly by the ISBN, especially in the column cone
region, which is helpful in improving the radial movement of particles
in the spouted bed.

(3) There exists a value of ξ (0.526),
which makes the elimination of the flow dead zone in the annular region
reach the best effect in the limited spouted bed space. Accordingly,
the pressure drop in spouted beds increases when adding the swirl
blade in the nozzle, and it reaches the maximum value when ξ
equals 0.526. The optimal overall fluidization quality of the spouted
bed occurs when ξ = 0.316.



In addition,
it is of great significance to study the influence
of the number of swirling blades and the inlet angle of the swirl
blade (β) on gas–solid two-phase flow behaviors in spouted
beds. This will be the subject of future studies.
