Interfaces combining
polydopamine (PDA) and nanoparticles have
been widely utilized for fabricating hybrid colloidal particles, thin
films, and membranes for applications spanning biosensing, drug delivery,
heavy metal detection, antifouling membranes, and lithium ion batteries.
However, fundamental understanding of the interaction between PDA
and nanoparticles is still limited, especially the impact of PDA on
nanoparticle nucleation and growth. In this work, PDA is used to generate
functional bonding sites for depositing titanium dioxide (TiO2) via atomic layer deposition (ALD) onto a nanoporous polymer
substrate for a range of ALD cycles (<100). The resulting hybrid
membranes are systematically characterized using water contact angle,
scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, nitrogen adsorption
and desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). An intriguing
nonlinear relationship was observed between the number of ALD cycles
and changes in surface properties (water contact angle and surface
roughness). Together with XPS study, those changes in surface properties
were exploited to probe the nanoparticle nucleation and growth process
on complex PDA-coated porous polymer substrates. Molecular level understanding
of inorganic and polymer material interfaces will shed light on fine-tuning
nanoparticle-modified polymeric membrane materials.

1 Introduction
Significant
effort has been invested into incorporating nanomaterials
directly into polymer matrices, metal oxide frameworks, or covalent
organic frameworks (COFs) for applications including mixed matrix
membranes, biomedical applications, nanostructured membrane surfaces,
and catalysis.1,2 However, till now theoretical
predictions of composite material functions have not been met, often
due to lack of fundamental understanding on atomic or molecular level
interactions at the interface of metal or ceramic nanoparticles (NPs)
and polymeric substrates.1,3 To fully realize the
potential of materials involving NPs and polymer substrates (in either
spherical or planar morphology), molecular level understanding of
interfacial interactions between inorganic NPs and their substrates
needs to be developed.1,4

Specifically, surface or
interface property modification using
covalent bonds and/or NPs has been extensively reported for applications
in the fields of clean energy, membrane separation, and biomedicine
to improve functionality, biocompatibility, or fouling resistance.5−9 Because of its versatile application and ease of functionalization,
dopamine has been used to modify surface properties of organic polymers,
metal oxides, and noble metals, after the initial report by Lee et
al.9−12 Direct deposition has been used primarily to render surfaces more
hydrophilic for a variety of applications, such as improving the water
dispersibility of nanoporous graphene foams for membrane protein extraction.13−17 Dopamine-treated surfaces can be further functionalized using catalytic
NPs, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2); self-assembly monolayer
reagents, including n-dodecyl mercaptan; or securing
proteins, such as aquaporins, to further optimize surface properties,
including increasing antifouling resistance.1,13,18−22 Using polydopamine (PDA) as a grafting material can
be particularly useful in sensing applications, including the detection
of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium using PDA and Fe3O4 core–shell NPs, biomolecule sensing through
the immobilization of glucose oxidase for glucose sensors, and detection
of small organic molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide sensors based
on PDA-entrapped G-quadruplex-hemin DNAzyme.9,23−25 Despite the wide use of dopamine-assisted surface
modification techniques, fundamental questions remain regarding how
surface properties, such as roughness, contact angle, and surface
chemical species, change on an atomic or molecular level, especially
after the further incorporation of NPs. In addition, correlations
between these properties and resultant hybrid/composite material interfaces
must be carefully examined to fine-tune surface treatments for targeted
applications.

Catalytic and photocatalytic NPs have been reported
for various
applications, including mitigating membrane fouling and developing
antimicrobial surfaces.5,26−29 To address the particle aggregation
challenge observed in liquid-phase deposition, vapor-phase deposition,
especially the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, has been recently
investigated.30−32 Thanks to its inherent self-limiting nature, ALD
as a vapor-phase deposition technique allows molecular, even atomic,
level control of the particle deposition process by tuning the number
of ALD cycles.30,31,33 In addition, recent breakthroughs in spatial ALD, where reactant
exposure is separated by space rather than time by moving the substrate
or the spray nozzles, now enable ALD to be easily incorporated into
continuous processes, reducing precursor consumption.34−38 However, fabrication of new products, such as organic light-emitting
diodes, using ALD depends on improved understanding of deposition
onto porous polymer substrates.39

One intricacy of ALD is that adjusting the number of ALD cycles
or exposure time allows gaseous reactants to penetrate into porous
structures,30,40 which allows material properties
to be modified on an atomic or molecular level. For example, atom
clusters or NPs can be formed instead of continuous, conformal films
by limiting the number of ALD cycles.39 This behavior is further complicated by the dependence of initial
nucleation and growth on substrate properties, including surface roughness,
chemistry, and porosity. Recently, subsurface nucleation was observed
inside polytetrafluroroethylene and polypropylene (PP) pores because
of a lack of bonding sites on the surface. To alleviate the problem,
plasma pretreatment was used to generate sites for nucleation.31,32 However, surface treatment with plasma can only be applied to a
limited number of materials because of its potential damage to many
polymeric substrates. Alternatively, we chose PDA to generate bonding
sites, which can also enhance NP adhesion via covalent bonding.9,41 Because of the wide range of materials on which PDA can be successfully
bonded and its biocompatibility,10 this
method could be extended to many sensitive materials used in applications
including nanomedicine.42,43 Additionally, using
a short dopamine polymerization combined with ALD treatment provides
a fast, scalable approach to adjusting surface properties compared
with techniques such as combined atom transfer radical polymerization
and click chemistry for improving polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) cytocompatibility.44

Using commercial PVDF ultrafiltration
membranes as a substrate,
we report how their surface properties change with a short PDA treatment
time, followed by TiO2 deposition via ALD. This system
provides promise in a variety of fields because of the biocompatibility
of PVDF,45,46 PDA,10 and TiO2.47 To the best of our knowledge,
PDA treatment has not been followed by ALD–TiO2 deposition,
and unlike previous reports of ALD–TiO2 deposition
directly onto PVDF,30 the number of ALD
cycles was carefully controlled in the range of 15–90 to probe
how surface properties evolve as nucleation and growth proceeds. Correlation
of surface and cross-sectional properties provides an understanding
on how desirable, but often competing, membrane surface properties
may be best balanced for targeting specific applications.

2 Results and Discussion
This study probes the nucleation
and growth process of TiO2 NPs on PDA-coated polymer substrates
using low-temperature
ALD. The inherent cyclic nature of ALD processes allows TiO2 to be deposited molecule by molecule, providing precise control
of polymer/metal oxide surface/interface properties. As discussed
in the Experimental Section, PVDF ultrafiltration
membranes were treated with PDA followed by ALD–TiO2 at 100 °C using tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium(IV) (TDMAT)
and water as precursors. Although the PDA coating time was kept at
15 min, the number of ALD cycles varied from 15 to 90. Neat membranes
and those treated with PDA or 15 ALD cycles were used as controls.
A complete list of sample names and corresponding treatments is shown
in Table 1.

2.1 Membrane Surface Roughness
and Morphology
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging
of the top surface and
cross-sectional areas was carried out for different samples. The neat,
PDA, and PDA/90ALD surfaces are shown in Figure 1. Consistent structures in Figure 1a–c demonstrate that
the conditions used in ALD treatment do not significantly alter the
membrane structure. Cross-sectional images were acquired for the area
between the top surface and the backing material. It is worth noting
that no NPs are observed on the surface or within the cross-sectional
SEM images of the PDA/90ALD sample (Figure 1d), which has the largest number of ALD cycles.
This may be attributed to the small size of TiO2 NPs deposited
and the limitation of our SEM equipment, indicating that titanium
dioxide deposition in our study (≤90 cycles of ALD) did not
result in large aggregates as often observed with wet-chemistry techniques.48 Other groups have published SEM images of PDA
on polymer substrates with deposition times longer than 15 min and
have observed little changes in morphology.15,18,49,50 On the basis
of the work by Kasemset et al., we expect the PDA layer to be around
1–2 nm for the deposition parameters used in this paper.51 Additionally, we expect an average growth rate
of 0.46 Å per cycle for the conditions we report here. Although
this suggests that a maximum coating of 6 nm (2 nm of PDA and 4 nm
for 90 ALD cycles) may be possible, the nucleation and growth phase
of ALD–TiO2 in this study, combined with the nanoporous
polymer substrate, suggests that the amount of TiO2 deposited
may be less than 4 nm.

and (d) the top surface of PDA/90ALD. A TEM image of (e) PDA on a
copper TEM grid, (f) TEM image of PDA/90ALD, and (g) TEM image of
PDA/60ALD and (h) NP size distribution.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of PDA/ALD–TiO2 depositions directly onto TEM grids provide evidence of NP
growth instead of thin-film growth. The TEM image of PDA alone is
shown in Figure 1e,
and Figure 1f presents
the TEM image of PDA/90ALD. Both images contain large dark areas attributed
to PDA, but smaller (less than 6 nm) dark areas attributed to TiO2 NPs are only observed for PDA/90ALD. NP size and radial distributions
were obtained through further image analysis. Size distributions for
PDA/15ALD, PDA/60ALD, and PDA/90ALD samples are shown in Figure 1h. The PDA/15ALD
samples show the highest fraction of small NPs. The treatment combination
has fewer ALD–TiO2 cycles than the other samples
considered, so the NPs are expected to be smaller. Interestingly,
the PDA/60ALD sample shows a higher proportion of large NPs than the
PDA/90ALD sample. This could be due to aggregation of nuclei on flexible
PDA ligands and subsequent nucleation on exposed active sites. Figure 1g demonstrates that
the NP spatial distribution appears to be less even for the PDA/60ALD
sample than for the PDA/15ALD and 15PDA/90ALD samples.

To further
understand how surface pore structures may be modified,
noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to characterize
membrane surfaces (Figure 2). The key surface pore morphology appears to be modified,
but the pores are not completely blocked by direct ALD–TiO2 or PDA/ALD–TiO2. Root-mean-square (rms)
surface roughness measurements are plotted in Figure 2b for 5 μm × 5 μm areas.
There is no significant roughness change among the samples.

ultrafiltration membrane and membranes treated with (b) 15ALD, (c)
PDA/15ALD, (d) PDA/30ALD, (e) PDA/60ALD, (f) PDA/75ALD, and (g) PDA/90ALD
and (h) rms surface roughness measurements for each sample. Note that
the palette scale bar for each AFM image was optimized for the given
sample, resulting in variations in the gradient color scales between
samples.

Changes in pore structure and
surface area were also quantified
using nitrogen adsorption and desorption experiments. Resulting data
were combined with Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda (BJH) theory and Brunauer,
Emmett, and Teller (BET) theory to calculate the BJH average pore
width (Figure 3a),
BJH average pore size distribution (Figure 3b), and BET surface area (Figure 3c), respectively. Adsorption
and desorption isotherms are shown in Figure S1. The shape of the isotherms is similar for different treatment combinations,
but the quantity adsorbed at high relative pressure varies. 15ALD,
PDA, PDA/15ALD, and PDA/60ALD adsorbed the largest quantities of nitrogen
at high relative pressure and had the largest average BET surface
areas. The average pore width decreased with PDA treatment and then
increased with ALD deposition from 15 to 75 cycles (Figure 3a). The consistent pore diameter
between the PDA and PDA/15ALD samples shows that the ALD reactor conditions
did not impact the membrane pore size and that a very small quantity
of TiO2 was deposited with only 15 ALD cycles. Further
increasing ALD cycles resulted in a slight increase in the average
pore width. This could be due to the blocking of pores that are smaller
than 2 nm.52 For all samples, the majority
of pore volume is a result of small pores (Figure 3b), with 15ALD, PDA, PDA/15ALD, and PDA/60ALD
samples containing the greatest total pore volume.

Figure 3 Nitrogen adsorption/desorption
data were used to calculate (a)
BJH desorption average pore width, (b) BJH adsorption pore size distributions,
and (c) BET surface area for neat PVDF, 15ALD, PVDF with PDA, and
PVDF with PDA/ALD–TiO2 deposition and (d) diagram
of proposed NP aggregation.

BET surface area trends differ from those observed for pore
size.
Initially, surface area increases with PDA treatment, most likely
resulting from the added pore volume by the porous PDA layer. However,
TiO2 deposition with 15 and 30 ALD cycles (PDA/15ALD and
PDA/30ALD) results in a decreased surface area relative to the PDA
sample, indicating that smaller pores are blocked by TiO2 particles as they nucleate and grow. When the number of ALD cycles
increases to 60, the surface area of PDA/60ALD increased, possibly
due to more exposed PDA areas when TiO2 NPs aggregated
to form bigger particles, as depicted in Figure 3c. Increasing amounts of bulky, incompletely
reacted TDMAT ligands on the membrane surface may also contribute
to the surface area increase when ALD cycles increase from 30 to 60.
Surface area decreased again when ALD cycles increased from 60 to
75 and 90, which may be attributed to pore blocking from agglomerated
TiO2 particles and additional TiO2 nucleation
and growth sites.

To summarize, the SEM, AFM, and BET results
suggest that PDA and
TiO2 deposition via ALD can be used to carefully alter
surface chemistry for targeted applications. Additional surface characterization
results using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figures 4 and 5) provide further insight on how surface chemistry and architecture
evolve as the nucleation and growth process proceeds.

2.2 Characterization of NP Nucleation and Growth
via XPS
XPS survey scans are shown for each ALD–TiO2 sample, along with neat PVDF, PDA-coated PVDF, PDA-coated
PVDF with ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, and 15ALD as controls in Figure S2. Additional F 1s and O 1s high-resolution
scans are included in Figures S3 and S4, respectively. We note that noticeable variations in membrane surface
chemistry were observed when duplicates of the neat PVDF and PDA/90ALD
samples were analyzed. This is likely due to the porous and anisotropic
nature of the substrates. Comparative survey scans are shown in Figures S5 and S6. Table 2 contains sample compositions for the PDA/15ALD,
PDA/60ALD, and PDA/90ALD samples obtained by XPS and SEM/energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDXS).

and PDA/90ALD

PDA/90ALD	SEM/EDX	 	90.12	 	9.71	0.17	 	 	
Titanium 2p peaks were not observed for the
15ALD, PDA/15ALD, and
PDA/30ALD samples. This is likely a result of the rough, porous polymer
substrate (Figure S7) and the early nucleation/growth
phase occurring for 15–30 cycles. The porous nature enables
the penetration of TiO2 nuclei into the subsurface and
subsequent nucleation in the subsurface, resulting in TiO2 deposition deeper than the approximately 10 nm depth probed with
XPS.53−55 Additionally, halogen-containing polymers are particularly
susceptible to X-ray-induced degradation, which demands lower X-ray
power and shorter acquisition time, reducing the sensitivity of XPS
results.55 The membranes used in this study
also have rough surfaces which further reduce signal intensity.56 Cumulatively, penetration of nascent nuclei
into the membrane subsurface during the initial ALD cycles and reduced
XPS sensitivity are responsible for the absence of a titanium 2p peak
for 15–30 ALD cycles.

Relative changes in the Ti content
deposited by ALD and the F content
present in the polymer substrate provide further evidence of subsurface
nucleation. EDXS results clearly show that the Ti content increased
from PDA/60ALD to PDA/90ALD, with the F content decreasing as the
number of ALD cycles increased. Conversely, XPS results reveal that
the Ti content decreased from PDA/60ALD to PDA/90ALD and the F content
increased as the ALD cycles increased. As XPS probes only a few nanometers
deep into the surface, while EDXS penetrates deeper (∼1 μm),
the discrepancy between XPS and EDXS results further confirm that
additional Ti penetrated into the porous PVDF substrate, as the number
of ALD cycles increased.

Because quantitative evidence of titanium
via XPS is only available
for 60 ALD cycles or greater, titanium-to-fluorine (Ti/F) ratios were
calculated for the PDA/60ALD, PDA/75ALD, and PDA/90ALD samples, as
shown in Figure 4a.
It was observed that the Ti/F ratio increased when the number of ALD
cycles increased from 60 to 75. However, the ratio decreased, intriguingly,
when the number of cycles continued to increase from 75 to 90. In
contrast, the intensity of the Ti 2p peak linearly increased with
cycle number in the range of 60–90 (Figure 4b). An increase in the amount of titanium,
combined with the nonlinear Ti/F ratio progression, suggests that
the fluorinated PVDF substrate initially becomes more covered with
titanium (from PDA/60ALD to PDA/75ALD). However, the decreased Ti/F
ratio from PDA/75ALD to PDA/90ALD suggests that more PVDF membrane
surface areas were exposed after 90 cycles of ALD, while the amount
of Ti increased. Considering the smaller pores (Figure 3b), smoother surfaces (Figure 3c), and comparable BET area, when ALD cycles
increased from 75 to 90, we attributed the decreased Ti/F ratio with
increased titanium quantity to TiO2 NP agglomeration and
additional nucleation sites when further increasing ALD cycles, consistent
with what was reported by Grillo et al.57 Briefly, in their study, platinum NPs grew nonlinearly onto graphene
nanoplates after long exposure times (4 min) because of NP diffusion
and coalescence at low temperatures (T < 100 °C).
Ostwald ripening is another pathway for nonlinear growth but is unlikely
to occur at low temperatures because of the high bond energies.57 Additionally, Lee and Hon et al. used 1000 ALD
cycles to deposit TiO2 onto silicon and observed no Ostwald
ripening below 250 °C.58 In our study,
ALD experiments were carried out at 100 °C, so Ostwald ripening
is unlikely to be the cause of the nonlinear changes in the Ti/F ratio
with ALD cycles because of the high bond energy of Ti–O bonds.59 Alternatively, because TiO2 NPs are
adhered to flexible PDA chains, NPs could aggregate without breaking
the bonds between PDA and the deposited NPs. Because the PDA chain
length can be tailored by fine-tuning dopamine polymerization time
in air, this phenomenon may be utilized as a secondary control over
deposited NP sizes in the submicron regime. Ongoing work in our group
is further validating this hypothesis by direct imaging techniques,
such as TEM.60

A second source of
the nonlinear Ti/F ratio progression may be
unreacted TDMAT precursor ligands. High-resolution N 1s XPS scans
(Figure 5) were used
to differentiate unreacted precursor ligands from PDA. The scans show
insignificant amounts of nitrogen on the neat and 15ALD samples, but
PDA deposition onto neat PVDF results in the formation of a peak at
about 400 eV. The intensity of this peak grows with further incorporation
of 15 ALD cycles (PDA/15ALD); however, after 30 ALD cycles, the peak
begins to divide into two visible peaks. The PDA/90ALD spectrum has
a shape and position similar to that of the PDA/30ALD sample but a
larger area. Increasing the number of ALD cycles generally increased
the N 1s peak area, with the exception from 75 to 90 ALD cycles, indicating
that additional nitrogen is either incorporated into the membrane
or exposed during the TiO2 deposition process. Figure 5b plots the relative
N 1s component peak areas as calculated using curve fitting (fittings
shown in Figures S8–S13). All samples
were fitted with two peaks, with the lower energy component corresponding
to C–N-type bonds and the lower energy component attributed
to C=N–C-type bonds common in PDA.9,61 PDA
contains numerous R–NH–R bonds, in addition to some
R=N–R bonds (about 1.3 eV lower binding energy than
R–NH–R bonds), although the saturated structure R–NH–R
is often reported.9,61,62

Alternatively, residual Ti–N(CH3)2 amine ligands could be present at about 398.6 eV from the unreacted
precursor.63 A low-energy amine component
was not observed by peak fitting, suggesting that the unreacted precursor
may not play a primary role in nonlinear surface property changes.
Compared to the linear relationship observed in direct TiO2 deposition onto PVDF,30 we postulate
that the nonlinear observation in our study may result from the dopamine
pretreatment. Decomposition or reconfiguration of PDA at elevated
temperature and high-vacuum ALD conditions or X-ray-induced changes
during XPS measurements could explain changes in the N 1s peak. Ongoing
work in our lab is aimed at understanding the influence of temperature
on PDA structure and determining the relative influences of possible
NP aggregation, unreacted precursor, and changes in the PDA structure
on surface chemistry and functionality.

2.3 Impact
of NP Nucleation and Growth on Membrane
Hydrophilicity
Another observation, as a consequence of the
NP nucleation and growth mechanism of TiO2 onto PDA-pretreated
PVDF, is a nonlinear water contact angle trend, as shown in Figure 6. Deposition of 15
ALD cycles of TiO2 directly onto the neat membrane resulted
in an 8% decrease in water contact angle, whereas coating with 15
min of PDA lead to a larger decrease (31%). For PDA-coated membranes
with small amounts of ALD-deposited titanium dioxide (PDA/15ALD and
PDA/30ALD), contact angles decreased linearly with increasing ALD
cycles relative to the neat and PDA-coated samples. Very interestingly,
the contact angle increased (from 34° to 69°) when the number
of ALD cycles further increased from 30 to 60 before decreasing again
with additional ALD cycles. Nikkola et al. reported a similar contact
angle trend when depositing Al2O3 via ALD to
modify thin-film composite polyamide reverse osmosis membranes using
trimethylaluminium and water as precursors. Briefly, they also observed
an immediate decrease in water contact angle with ALD–Al2O3 treatment, but further increasing the number
of cycles increased the water contact angle. This was partially attributed
to the unreacted precursor on the membrane surface.64 In our study, a lower binding energy N 1s peak component,
potentially attributed to TDMAT ligands, was not observed, suggesting
that NP aggregation may play a primary role.

Figure 6 (a) Water contact angles
for neat, 15ALD, PDA, and PDA followed
by 15/30/60/75/90 ALD cycles samples and (b) corresponding water droplet
images [same sample order from left to right as panel (a)].

2.4 NP Nucleation
and Growth Mechanism
Together, TEM, XPS, BET, AFM, and water
contact angle results describe
a nuanced nucleation and growth process for TiO2 on PDA.
Specifically, as shown by TEM images of NP size distribution, the
particles grow in a clearly nonlinear fashion (Figure 1). First, samples from the smallest ALD cycles
(PDA/15ALD) showed the highest fraction of small NPs, and PDA/60ALD
showed higher percentage of large NPs than PDA/15ALD and PDA/90ALD.
Second, as expected, the increase of ALD cycles from 15 generated
larger TiO2 particles in PDA/60ALD. Finally, the decrease
in particle size as ALD cycle increased from 60 to 90 (sample PDA/60ALD
and PDA/90ALD, respectively) may be attributed to further agglomeration
of TiO2 nuclei on flexible PDA ligands, consequently encouraging
nucleation on exposed active sites instead of secondary growth of
existing TiO2 NPs.

With only 15 and 30 ALD cycles
(PDA/15ALD and PDA/30ALD), TiO2 NPs nucleate and grow but
remain below the detection limit of XPS. However, even with the minute
amount of TiO2 on the surfaces, a noticeable decrease in
the BET surface area (Figure 3) was observed. Upon further increasing ALD cycles, the resulting
PDA/60ALD surface shows a rougher surface with higher water contact
angle than the other PDA/ALD–TiO2 samples. The subsequent
decrease in the Ti/F ratio, increasing titanium peak area, and increasing
N 1s peak area for the PDA/90ALD samples indicate that NP aggregation
occurs, exposing more neat membrane (fluorine containing) and dopamine-treated
surface areas (N 1s containing) (Figure 3c). Decreased BET surface areas for the PDA/75ALD
and PDA/90ALD samples, compared to the PDA/60ALD samples, indicate
that NP aggregation and continued nucleation and growth not only reduced
the total pore volume but also further smoothed the surface. As such,
for the PDA-modified polymeric surfaces, the intriguing nucleation
and growth mechanism may be exploited to enable drastic changes in
membrane surface properties by depositing a small amount of TiO2 via ALD.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, surface properties of commercial PVDF ultrafiltration
membranes were altered using PDA followed by ALD of TiO2 in the nucleation and growth phase (<100 cycles) and compared
to direct deposition onto PVDF without PDA. Nonlinearities in material
properties were observed that may be carefully fine-tuned for desired
surface properties in material design. Nonlinear trends are attributed
to NP aggregation, but changes in the PDA structure and unreacted
precursor could also play a role. Although ongoing research focuses
on further clarifying the contribution of these three factors, mobility
of NPs due to PDA flexibility may be primarily responsible for the
nonlinear trends, based on XPS and nitrogen adsorption data. The versatility
and biocompatibility of PDA and TiO2 render surface pretreatment
with PDA followed by TiO2 deposition via ALD a feasible
method for carefully engineering surface properties of many materials,
although resultant properties will depend on the specific support
structure and surface pretreatment conditions.65 A thorough, atomic or molecular level understanding of
surface treatments with PDA and NPs may be rudimentary to many material
optimizations such as improving the solubility of COFs and engineering
textile surface properties through ALD.2,66−68

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Synder flat sheet PVDF
ultrafiltration membranes (YMBN3001, 0.22 mm thickness) were purchased
from Sterlitech Corporation. Dopamine hydrochloride was acquired from
Sigma-Aldrich. Tris-HCl solution (pH = 8.5, 1.0 M) was purchased from
Teknova Inc., and TDMAT from Sigma-Aldrich (99.999%) was used as received
as the ALD precursor.

4.2 Membrane Wetting
All membranes were
wetted with ethanol before PDA surface treatment. This process consisted
of submersion in ethanol for 1 min followed by soaking in deionized
(DI) water for 30 min.

4.3 Dopamine Polymerization
Tailoring
dopamine deposition to a specific application is strongly dependent
on dopamine concentration and deposition time because these parameters
directly impact the PDA layer thickness and chain structure.51,69,70 Times of 3–24 h are commonly
used with up to 5 days of polymerization in some cases.7,10,11,15,16,18,19,47,71−74 Additionally, a thorough analysis of the effect of dopamine concentration
and polymerization time was recently reported by Kasemset et al.,
in which initial dopamine concentrations between 0.1 and 8 mg mL–1 and polymerization times between 15 and 240 min were
investigated, with the highest pure water permeance being achieved
with an initial concentration of 2 mg mL–1 and polymerization
time of 15 min.51 As such, polymerization
time greatly impacts material performance and needs to be carefully
optimized for targeted applications. In this case, we used 15 min
of dopamine polymerization to produce relatively short polymer chains.

Selected membranes were coated with PDA in a process consisting
of several steps and closely following that used by Shao et al.18 Briefly, after ethanol pretreatment, membranes
were soaked in Tris-HCl solution (pH = 8.5) for 5 min. This was followed
by soaking the active side of the membrane in an aqueous dopamine
solution (2 mg mL–1) prepared in Tris-HCl solution
(pH = 8.5) for 15 min. All dopamine-coated membranes were rinsed with
DI water to terminate polymerization and remove noncovalently bonded
molecules. Membranes were continuously agitated on a Thermo Scientific
test tube rocker during PDA coating.

4.4 ALD of
Titanium Dioxide (ALD–TiO2) onto the Membrane Surface
Following dopamine treatment
and/or ethanol wetting, TiO2 deposition was performed using
an Ultratech/CNT Fiji F200 ALD system (Waltham, MA). The same substrates
were modified with highly variable conditions, but not repeated. The
ALD reactor was maintained at 1 × 10–5 Torr
or better when idle and 1 × 10–1 Torr during
TiO2 deposition. TDMAT was utilized as the metal precursor
and 18 MΩ water was utilized as the oxygen source. The TDMAT
precursor source was heated to 75 °C, whereas the water source
was kept at room temperature. The precursor delivery lines and substrate
were heated to 100 °C, with all temperatures stabilizing before
the deposition was initiated. Argon (Ar) carrier gas was continually
flowing at a rate of 0.260 L min–1, with one complete
deposition cycle consisting of a 0.12 s pulse of TDMAT, 60 s purge
with Ar, 0.06 s pulse of water, and 60 s purge with Ar. A summary
of processing parameters for the ALD–TiO2 membranes
is included in Table 1. Membrane samples that were treated with PDA, followed by ALD–TiO2 will be referred to as PDA/ALD–TiO2. An
ALD growth rate of 0.46 Å/cycle was estimated by performing ALD
depositions onto silicon (100). The rate was measured by spectral
reflectance using Filmmetrics F20-UV and accompanying fitting software
(Filmetrics, San Diego, CA).

The ALD deposition was optimized
for 100 °C, based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments,
to avoid polymer degradation. Heat-induced changes to membrane morphology
were examined by placing a membrane sample in the ALD chamber at the
conditions used without depositing titanium onto the surface. AFM
characterization was carried out for the heat-treated and neat PVDF
membrane samples. Details of both TGA and AFM measurements are outlined
in the Supporting Information, with results
summarized in Figures S14 and S15. For experiments utilizing UV light
to irradiate TiO2 NPs, treated membranes were exposed to
UV light using a 100 W OmniCure S2000 lamp for 10 min.

4.5 Membrane Characterization
SEM characterization
was carried out using a FEI Quanta FEG 450 field emission scanning
electron microscope equipped with a backscattered electron detector.
Cross-sectional images were taken in the bulk membrane, between the
support and active side to search for changes in the overall membrane
structure. TEM/EDXS images were collected using a Hitachi H-7000 transmission
electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. Fromvar/carbon
square copper grids with 400 mesh from Electron Microscopy Sciences
were used for all depositions (FCF400-CU-UA). AFM was performed in
a noncontact ac mode (Oxford Instruments Asylum Research, Santa Barbara,
CA). rms surface roughness values from 5 μm × 5 μm
areas are reported. Water contact angles were measured using a Kruse
EasyDrop system. Reported values are the average of five samples collected
for each membrane type.

BET porosity measurements of treated
and untreated membranes were carried out using nitrogen adsorption/desorption
cycles at 75.4 K (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). All calculations were
completed using Micromeritics ASAP 2020 software. The algorithms are
described in the ASAP 2020 Operator’s Manual and are briefly
described below.75

To begin calculation
of the BET surface area, eq 1 is used to calculate the BET2 transform
for B1 in units of g cm–3 STP for each data point. 1  

The parameter Prel1 is the
unitless relative pressure between the absolute pressure and saturation
pressure at a point, and Nads1 represents the amount of gas adsorbed after equilibrating the dose
and has units of cm3 STP. From eq 1, the software calculates the slope (S, g cm–3 STP) and y-intercept
(YINT, g cm–3 STP) of
the resulting line. These quantities can be combined with the analysis
gas cross-sectional area (nm2) to calculate the BET surface
area using eq 2. 2  

The BJH method calculates
pore sizes using the Kelvin model of
pore filling. First, the Kelvin core radius is calculated using eq 3. 3  

In eq 3, A is the adsorbate
property factor, F is the fraction
of pores open at both ends, and Pr1 is the relative pressure. The fraction of pores open at both
ends is assumed to be zero for desorption. Further calculations account
for the thickness of the adsorbed layer to yield an adjusted measurement
of the pore size. Pore size distributions were calculated using BJH
adsorption.

XPS measurements were obtained using Kratos Axis
Ultra with a delay
line detector with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source system
(Kratos Analytical Manchester, UK). The X-ray source power of 60 W
was chosen to minimize X-ray damage as sample discoloration was observed
with higher X-ray power. Survey scans were collected with passing
energy of 80 eV and dwell time of 500 ms per 0.10 eV. High-resolution
scans were collected with passing energy of 40 eV with dwell times
of 250–340 ms and represent an average of three scans. An onboard
electron flood gun was employed to provide charge compensation for
all measurements. When idle, the system was maintained at a vacuum
of 5 × 10–10 Torr or lower. During measurements,
the vacuum was maintained between 1 × 10–9 and
2 × 10–9 Torr. All spectra were shifted to
align the C 1s peak attributed to saturated, unfunctionalized carbon
to 284.5 eV.
