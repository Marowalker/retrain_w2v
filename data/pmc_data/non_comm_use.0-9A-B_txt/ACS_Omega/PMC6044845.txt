Fluorescent
carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized by laser
irradiation of carbon glassy particles suspended in polyethylene glycol
200 by two methods, a batch and a flow jet configuration. The flow
jet configuration is carried out by the simple combination of common
laboratory objects to construct a home-made passage reactor of continuous
flow. Despite the simplicity of the system, the laser energy is better
harvested by the carbon microparticles, improving the fabrication
efficiency a 15% and enhancing the fluorescence of CQDs by an order
of magnitude in comparison with the conventional batch. The flow jet-synthesized
CQDs have a mean size of 3 nm and are used for fluorescent imaging
of transparent healthy and cancer epithelial human cells. Complete
internalization is observed with a short incubation time of 10 min
without using any extra additive or processing of the cell culture.
The CQDs are well fixed in the organelles of the cell even after its
death; hence, this is a simple manner to keep the cell information
for prolonged periods of time. Moreover, the integrated photostability
of the CQDs internalized in in vitro cells is measured and it remains
almost constant during at least 2 h, revealing their outstanding performance
as fluorescent labels.

Introduction
Fluorescence carbon
quantum dots (CQDs) are described as carbon
nanoparticles of less than 10 nm diameter that demonstrate a fluorescence
emission. In spite of being discovered at the beginning of the 21st
century,1 in a short period of time, CQDs
have emerged as a powerful low toxic, environmentally friendly, and
low-cost nanomaterial with promising perspectives. Their impact in
the nanotechnology community has had a direct and remarkable influence
on applications such as in vivo imaging,2 cancer therapy,3 biosensing,4 and solar energy conversion.5 Among the vast majority of the available nanoscopic fluorescent
agents, CQDs stand out from the rest because of their outstanding
physicochemical properties such as tunable photoluminescence, high
photostability against photobleaching and blinking, easy surface passivation
and functionalization, and favorable biocompatibility.6−9

Stimulated by a rapid growth of research interest in CQDs,
numerous
chemical and physical synthesis techniques have been developed. Common
routes for preparing fluorescent CQDs include collecting the soot
of a burning candle,10 hydrothermal treatment,11 microwave synthesis,12 pyrolysis,13 ultrasonic synthesis,14 and so forth. Among all of them, laser synthesis
has stood out above the rest because it constitutes a single-step,
green, and simple strategy that neither requires the use of external
chemical agents nor promotes the creation of byproducts that may lead
to further cross chemical effects, guarantying in this way a high-purity
synthesis of CQDs15−19 and nanodiamonds.20,21 The high purity of the manufactured
materials makes possible their effective implementation in extremely
sensitive systems, such as human being cells22 or in vivo animals.23 Principal laser
synthesis methods of carbon dots can be classified in laser ablation
of carbonaceous solid targets immersed in a liquid15,16 and laser fragmentation of suspensions containing the powder carbon
material.17−19

 The laser fragmentation in liquids technique
 is based
on the irradiation of a suspension composed of micrometric or nanometric
solid particles dispersed in a liquid with a pulsed laser source.
The interaction between the intense laser radiation and the colloid
leads to the size reduction of the solid content through photothermal
vaporization or Coulomb explosion mechanisms, depending on the laser
fluence and pulse duration,24−28 leading to an exceptional accuracy in reshaping.29 In a conventional batch processing configuration, shown
in Figure 1a, the powder
carbon material is dispersed into the solvent and the suspension is
contained in a glass cell for laser irradiation. During irradiation,
a magnetic stirrer or ultrasound is used to expedite the movement
of carbon particles and prevent gravitational settling. Although this
procedure to synthesize carbon dots has provided excellent results,
it also presents some disadvantages. On the one hand, graphite or
carbon nanoparticles lead to the production of a black suspension
so the laser beam experiences a fluence gradient within the irradiated
volume because of the losses by scattering or absorption. This fact
causes a reduced control of the process as different mechanisms such
as fragmentation and melting may occur simultaneously in the vessel.
On the other hand, as the total liquid volume is larger than the irradiated
volume, the method does not guarantee that all the particles pass
through the laser beam; hence, there is a mixing of the synthesized
material and leftovers that should be removed by postprocessing treatment
to get rid of the bigger carbonaceous material by centrifugation or
other methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, an alternative
synthesis method using the flow jet passage reactor has never been
explored to synthesize CQDs. In this method, first proposed in 2010
by Wagener and Barcikowski, the laser beam is focused in a thin liquid
jet composed of microparticles in suspension (see Figure 1b).30 Then, the solid content suspended in the liquid is being irradiated
at the same fluence, promoting the same processing conditions for
the entire sample and a more efficient energy delivery of laser radiation.31,32

flow jet (the size distributions are displayed below, respectively

In this research, we use a low-cost
liquid jet passage reactor
(see Figure S1) in the continuous operation
mode to synthesize CQDs. A comparative study with a batch processing
configuration demonstrates that the flow jet has higher production
efficiency and an enhanced fluorescent response, and it is the most
appropriate method toward a scale-up synthesis of CQDs with laser.
Once the superior performance of the CQDs synthesized by the passage
reactor is proved, the nanoparticles are used as in vivo biomarkers
in sane and cancer human being cells with long-term photostability
even in degraded cells.

Results and Discussion
The irradiated
colloid is an 11 mL sample taken from an initial
sample of 40 mg of carbon glassy particles dispersed in 100 mL of
polyethylene glycol 200 (both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich). The original
size of carbon solid particles is 2–12 μm, but the suspension
was milled till most of the particles got a size of around 1 μm
(images of the size distribution of the nanoparticles measured by
dynamic light scattering are provided in Figure S2, Supporting Information). The laser irradiation was carried
out using the second harmonic of a Nd:YAG pulsed laser (Brilliant,
Quantel), with a pulse width of 4 ns Full Width at Half Maximum (fwhm)
at a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm and a repetition rate of 10
Hz. The laser radiation power over the suspension was set to 300 mW
at 532 nm. It was focused by a cylindrical lens with a focal length
of 300 mm, providing a fluence of ∼6 J/cm2 at the
focal spot. In batch processing, the focal spot was located 2 mm inside
the cuvette containing the educt, and the liquid was constantly stirred
by means of a magnetic stirrer at 100 rpm. In the flow jet, the focal
spot size in the direction of liquid flowing is 4 mm to irradiate
the maximum number of particles; this guarantees that the particles
are reached mostly by the same laser fluence. The period of flux in
the liquid jet flow was 30 s. Further details of the fabrication of
a low-cost continuous flow jet and a short video (Video S1) of the experimental setups can be found in Supporting Information section S1.

The
appropriate fluence for laser fragmentation was determined
through a modification of the particle heating–melting–evaporation
model.24,33 As there is not enough reliable thermodynamic
data and absorption characteristics for the black carbon material
dispersed in PEG, all estimations were made for graphite particles
of the same sizes.34,35 However, as the graphite never
melts but experiences sublimation at high temperatures, the original
model was modified to estimate the critical fluence values at which
particles start to sublimate and sublimate completely, see Figure 1c. Details of the
theoretical calculations can be found in Supporting Information section S3. The fluence value of 6 J/cm2 for the irradiation is chosen to assure a complete sublimation process
even for bigger particles. Even though it can be seen in Figure 1c that for carbon
black particles of 1 μm(initial irradiation particle size shown
in Figure S2, Supporting Information) the
fluence value needed for complete sublimation is about 8 J/cm2, for 6 J/cm2, the sublimation process is initiated
and after several irradiation cycles, the particles are effectively
reduced to CQDs. The value of 6 J/cm2 is experimentally
found to be the optimum for our system. Higher fluence values lead
to the generation of nonlinear effects in the liquid jet as well as
instabilities of the flow jet. Lower fluence values increase the necessary
number of cycles for particle size reduction,  besides, big particles
can even be not reduced if the fluence value is lower than the sublimation
start value for that particle size (Figure 1c).

The flow jet solution changed its
color progressively from gray
to caramel color after ∼3 h of laser irradiation, which indicated
the formation of CQDs (see the complete evolution in Figure S3). As the batch-processing sample showed a darker
brown, the processing time of both samples was set to 4 h. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs displayed in Figure 1d,e show the characteristic
spherical morphology of laser-synthesized CQDs. In batch processing,
the average size of the CQDs obtained by Gaussian fitting of the size
distribution, Figure 1g, is (3.57 ± 0.07) nm with a curve width of 0.49 nm. In the
flow jet, the average size measured, Figure 1h, is (2.78 ± 0.04) nm and a width of
0.34 nm. Both techniques lead to a similar size reduction, but by
using the flow jet technique, it is possible to reduce the material
in a more effective way due to the fact that laser fluence can be
delivered to the particles in a more efficient way. The improved control
over the fluence in the irradiation achieved by the flow jet system
also reduces size dispersion of the CQDs obtained as well as the amount
of big particles in the final sample (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Moreover, for a period of observation
of 10 months, no changes were observed in color, size, stability,
or properties of the CQDs (see Figures 2d and S8, Supporting Information). Their long-term stability proves the generated CQDs as an excellent
option for bionanotechnology-related applications.

eye. (b) Linear fits of the integrated fluorescence intensities against

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the supernatant
of both products
after undergoing centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 rpm (Figure 1f) revealed that the use of
the flow jet strategy leads to the manufacture of the highest amount
of CQDs, where (83.9 ± 0.2)% of the original solid content is
turned into useful CQDs, with a final concentration of CQDs being
0.029 wt %, whereas the classical strategy only leads to the reduction
of (68.7 ± 1.3)% of the original amount, with a final concentration
of CQDs being 0.023 wt % (details of the calculation can be found
in Supporting Information section S2).

As lasers are easily integrated in a production chain, it is interesting
to automate the process of synthesis of CQDs, as the methods proposed
up to now are discontinuous in time. The obtained results are a proof-of-concept
that proves that the passage reactor can provide a good strategy to
achieve a continuous, high quality, and high production process for
the synthesis of CQDs without the necessity of replacing a solid target
or a liquid suspension in short periods of time. In this sense, it
is envisioned as a suitable method for laser synthesis of CQDs for
industrial production.

Expected visible photoluminescence was
observed in the prepared
samples according to the reduced size of the CQDs generated. To confirm
that the fluorescence was emitted from the CQDs and not from the liquid
solvent, the PEG200 was irradiated by a 405 nm laser pointer showing
a mild emission (see Figure S5, Supporting Information). Interestingly, it is clearly seen by the naked eye that when the
samples are illuminated with 365 nm UV light, the photoluminescence
is higher for the flow jet samples (Figure 2a), which is confirmed by measuring the quantum
yield (QY) (Figure 2b). On the basis of the comparative method,36 the QY is calculated using the slope of the line determined from
the plot of the integrated fluorescence intensities against the absorbance.
In this case, the QY can be calculated as QY = Qr(m/mr)(n/nr),2 where m stands for the slope of the line and n is the refractive index of solvent. The subscript r represents
the reference fluorophore of known QY; quinine sulfate (in 0.1 M H2SO4) was used in this case. The resulting linear
fits obtained from the reference fluorophore and the two samples are
shown in Figure 2b.
These results show that the QY of the CQDs synthesized with the flow
jet (4.5%) is approximately 1 order of magnitude higher than the ones
obtained with the batch system (0.5%).

It should be noted that
the samples obtained with the batch and
the flow jet setups are prepared from the same initial suspension
of carbon black microparticles, and hence the concentration of carbon
is the same in every sample and does not affect the QY measurements.
The color differences are due to the reduced efficiency of the batch
configuration in reducing particle size, 15% higher efficiency for
the flow jet configuration. This fact can be clearly seen in Figure S8; after 10 months, the particles that
are not reduced to CQDs sedimentate and the color of both samples
gets similar. Inspection of TEM pictures (Figure S4, Supporting Information) prove the presence of a larger population
of micrometric carbon pieces for the batch resulting in a darker color
for the colloid as it contains more particles larger than 10 nm.

Because of their outstanding properties, in the rest of the paper,
we focus our attention in the CQDs synthesized with the flow jet. Figure S6 shows the UV–visible absorption
spectra of CQDs, where it is possible to observe a strong absorption
peak located at 220 nm, commonly associated with the transition π–π*
of aromatic C–C bonds present in the CQD systems according
to a bandgap transition mechanism based on conjugated π-domains.37 It is also possible to observe that the second
peak is a bit mitigated and located at 340 nm, which is related to
the n−π* transitions due to the C=O bonds in the
nanoparticle surface. Peaks at 320, 300, and 287 nm from other transitions
are also observed, which might be associated to a consequence of surface
passivation by the interaction between CQDs and PEG.38 The absorption mechanism could also be explained based
on the quantum-confinement effect, emissive traps located at the surface
of CQDs, and radiative recombination of excitons, among others.39 However, the aim of the present research work
is not centered on elucidating the reasons behind the absorption behavior
of CQDs.

On the other hand, the broadband emission photoluminescence
spectra40 of the CQDs synthesized by the
flow jet strategy
are shown in Figure 2c. The figure clearly illustrates that by progressively increasing
the excitation wavelength from 210 to 450 nm, the fluorescence response
can be tuned. The fluorescence emission peaks related to the excitation
wavelengths around 287 nm are the strongest and by exciting with 280
nm, an emission peak at 376 nm with a fwhm of 77 nm is obtained. Exciting
the sample with wavelengths close to 300 nm, the fluorescence obtained
is reduced to 43% of the maximum and is lower when the excitation
wavelengths are in the 320 nm region, 36%. This reduction implies
a different mechanism of photoluminescence related to each absorption
peak, leading to its association with different transitions. Fluorescence
excited at 405 nm is also important as is a common excitation laser
diode source for fluorescence microscope imaging applications. The
fluorescence maximum obtained by exciting with 405 nm is located at
464 nm with a fwhm of 112 nm and a fluorescence emission which is
5% of the maximum emission obtained. Even though the fluorescence
response gets reduced compared to 280 nm excitation, it is perfectly
suitable for fluorescence imaging applications as shown in Figure 4. Besides, the increased
width of the fluorescence response, together with the wide range of
fluorescence excitation wavelengths, opens up the opportunity of using
the generated CQDs for acquiring fluorescence images with a wide variety
of detectors and excitation sources.

The Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of the
CQDs and PEG200 in Figure 3a exhibit the presence of new bounds generated around the
CQDs. The absorption peak observed at 1646 cm–1 indicates
the formation of C=O in the outer surface of the CQDs. The
increased absorption from 3000 to 3600 cm–1 is due
to the contribution of the C–OH bond and the carboxylic group
C–O–OH anchored at the nanoparticle surface.41 The attachment of functional groups to the CQD
surface was also analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
In Figure 3b, the analysis
of the flow jet sample is shown. The overall C 1s peak in the range
of 283–291 eV is fitted by a superposition of three peaks.
The first binding-energy peak (284.8 eV) can be attributed to the
C–C bond, whereas the other two peaks can be assigned to C–OH
(286.5 eV) and C–O–OH or C=O (289.2 eV). The
large C–OH peak indicates that most of surface carbon atoms
are passivated through the −OH bonding. The C–C peak
describes the presence of surface carbon atoms completely connected
with the inner carbon atoms. The last peak is associated to carbon
atoms passivated through C–O–OH or C=O bonding.
The atomic concentration of functionalized carbon atoms was quantitatively
evaluated based on the peak area ratios and obtained to be of approximately
85%. Because of the small size of the CQDs, the surface-area-to-volume
ratio is high, approximately 1 nm–1; hence, an elevated
percentage of the carbon atoms is in the surface of the nanoparticle.
These active carbon atoms play a very significant role in the photoluminescence
of the CQDs.

CQDs have attracted widespread attention in recent years
in the
field of fluorescence imaging.42,43 Here, we explore the
CQDs obtained with our method for fluorescence labeling of human life
cells. Three different types of cells were used: healthy oral epithelial
cells (OECs) from volunteers, a lung cancer cell line A549, and a
colon cancer cells line HT29. These epithelial cells are transparent
and no auto-fluorescence was observed at the excitation wavelength
of 405 nm while collecting the emission at 420–637 nm. Consequently,
there is a need to use markers to differentiate the main organelles
of the cell.

OECs were donated by 10 different healthy subjects.
The samples
were extracted from each subject by mechanical exfoliation accordingly
to a variation of the protocol reported by Cepeda-Pérez.44 The same protocol was followed to extract all
the OECs; after the subject has rinsed the mouth using ultrapure Milli-Q
water, an interdental brush was used to carefully scrape the inner
area of each cheek. The scraped area was located between the first
and the second molar on both sides of the jaw. A sample was taken
from each individual and dispersed in 1 mL of sodium chloride solution
(Fluirespira 0.9% NaCl in H2O). It was mixed with 40 μL
of CQDs dispersed in PEG200. After 1 min of incubation at room temperature
a drop of the product was deposited in a microscope slide. Next, the
fluorescence emission under 405 nm excitation wavelength while collecting
the emission at 420–637 nm was detected by means of a confocal
microscope (Leica TCS SP8). In Figure 4a, where both transmission
and fluorescence images are displayed, it is shown that the CQDs enhance
the morphologies of the OECs as they are well spread all over the
cell with a high predominance in the nucleus. The samples of all volunteers
were observed with the microscope showing similar results (see Figure
S7 of Supporting Information) and a 3D
image of a group of cells is represented in Supporting Information Video S2 to prove the internalization of the
CQDs in the whole volume of the cell and that 3D information of the
cell structures can be extracted. The image of an OEC after 10 days
in the microscope slide at room temperature is shown in Figure 4b. In this case, the transmission
image shows signals of cell death as lack of nuclei and membrane disruption.
However, the fluorescence image shows a “frozen” image
of the live cell. Therefore, this technique can be used to keep the
cell information for prolonged periods of time as the CQDs are not
degraded under this circumstance.

cell types, incubated with
CQDs. Fluorescence images, under 405 nm for wavelength excitation,
are shown on the left side and the corresponding bright-field images

during 10 min.

Two different human cancer
cell lines were used to test the CQDs
in vitro: lung adenocarcinoma (A-549) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29).
Cells were cultivated in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and 1% amphoterycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with
5% CO2. 100 000 cells/well were grown on glass coverslips
in a six-well plate for 24 h. Then, 40 μL/well of CQDs in PEG200
were added to the cell medium, and after 10 min at room temperature,
cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline
(DPBS). The coverslips were placed on a microscope slide and observed
under the confocal microscope. As shown in Figure 4c,d, the CQDs are completely internalized,
lightening the whole cell
and without any background fluorescence signal. The fluorescence of
CQDs was detectable inside the cell, including nuclei, after 10 min
from the addition. For HT-29, not all the nuclei contain a high concentration
of CQDs; measurements for longer incubation times for HT-29, A-549,
and OECs proved that nuclei internalization remains the same as that
observed after 10 min incubation. This indicates that the internalization
process is very fast, even faster than the time required for sample
preparation. The differential factors are the cell morphology and
cell structure, leading to a lower internalization in all nuclei for
HT-29 (Figure 4c,d)
and high nuclear internalization for OECs (Figure 4a,b, for more examples, see Figure S7, Supporting Information) and A-549 (Figure 4e,f). Please note that despite
the different kind of epithelial cells, in all cases, a fluorescence
image with no background is obtained, which indicates that the fabricated
CQDs are clearly internalized. In the case of HT-29 (Figure 4c,d), it can be observed that
CQDs accumulate at both reticular and vesicular structures in the
cell, whereas in the case of A-549 (Figure 4e,f), the accumulation at vesicular structures
predominates. The presence of PEG200 in the CQDs dilution helps to
preserve the samples from degradation and to retain the morphology
of the cells.

The integrated photostability of the CQDs during
internalization
in a live cell was measured, which provides a good knowledge of the
CQD response for both in vivo and in vitro applications. During 5
h, the temporal evolution of the fluorescence image of a lung cancer
cell, A549, irradiated with a 405 nm laser source is measured by taking
an image every 20 s. The normalized photoluminescence intensity was
determined by integrating the intensity value of every pixel in a
defined squared area around the cell, dotted lines in Figure 5, for each image acquired during
the 5 h. Then, normalization is done with respect to the value of
the image with the highest integrated fluorescence. The variation
of the integrated photoluminescence intensity is represented in Figure 5 together with an
image of the A549 cell. It remains almost constant during 2 h and
is only reduced a 40% in 5 h (see Video S3 of the Supporting Information). Conventionally widely used commercial
fluorescence markers such as Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 experience
the same reduction in shorter periods of time, 745 and 4 min,46 respectively. As
the measurements are directly performed in the cell with the confocal
microscope, the decrease after 2 h of irradiation is not only due
to the decay of the fluorescence of the CQDs but also due to other
factors as the laser and mechanical stability of the microscope and
cell movement.

intensity

h of irradiation is shown on the left with the area where the intensity
is integrated marked with a dotted line.

Conclusions
We developed a system for the fabrication of
CQDs in PEG200 by
laser irradiation based on a continuous flow jet. After 4 h of laser
irradiation, the production of CQDs is higher and exhibits a smaller
size than with a batch processing configuration. These facts indicate
that the laser energy is more efficiently delivered to the sample
thanks to the lack of losses in scattering, absorption, and its better
distribution in all the volume of the liquid. Consequently, this proof-of-concept
experiment gives enough evidence enforcing the statement that a system
based on a continuous flow jet provides a better strategy for scaling-up
the process of fabrication of CQDs from carbonaceous suspensions by
laser. A study of the photoluminescence shows that CQDs exhibited
an excitation-dependent emission behavior, with longer emission wavelength
for longer excitation wavelength. The fluorescence emission intensity
related to excitation wavelengths close to 287 nm is the strongest.
A study of the surface functional groups by XPS and FTIR demonstrates
the presence of C=O, C–OH, C–O–C, and
C–O–OH groups which have a great potential for biological
applications in conjugating drug or targeting moieties. The CQDs have
been directly applied in imaging of different kinds of in vitro human
cells. This study provides two important conclusions. First, the CQDs
in PEG200 are a good instrument to preserve the cell information even
after its death as they are not degraded and its position is kept
constant. Second, a real time measurement of the integrated photostability
in the cells demonstrates that the CQDs do not experience photoblinking
and have a reduced photobleaching compared to standard fluorescence
markers. The proposed method has a high potential for fabricating
novel carbon luminescent materials by pulsed lasers radiation that
can benefit many fields, such as optoelectronic, biosensing, or bioimaging.

Methods
Materials
The flow jet experimental setup consists
of simple cost-effective elements, a silicon tube, two pipette tips,
and a funnel to make the liquid flow in a closed loop boosted by a
peristaltic pump (Watson Marlow 313S). A picture showing the distribution
of the elements can be seen in Figure S1. One of the pipette tips is cut and inserted in the other to avoid
the splash of the liquid in the irradiation zone. The irradiated colloid
is composed of 40 mg of carbon glassy particles dispersed in 100 mL
of polyethylene glycol 200. The original size of carbon solid particles
is 2–12 μm. A ball mill is used during 5 h at 300 rpm
to reduce the particle size.

Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence
spectra shown
in Figure 2c were recorded
using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Varian) with
excitation wavelengths from 200 to 400 nm and a 10 mm path length
quartz cuvette.

Infrared Spectroscopy Spectrum
The
FTIR spectrum (Figure 3a) was measured using
a FT/IR-6200 (Jasco) Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

Internalization
and Fluorescence Images
The samples
extraction protocol is a variation of the Cepeda-Pérez.44 The internalization of the CQDs into samples
of OECs taken from 10 different subjects was analyzed by fluorescence
images acquired with an inverted confocal microscope Leica TCS SP8
using a 405 nm diode as the excitation source and a PMT (photomultiplier
tube) collecting light in the 420–637 nm region as the detector.

the help of R.T.-M., M.F.-A., and G.M.-V. The biological samples were
prepared and internalization results analyzed by E.F. The internalization
procedure of the CQDs in biological samples and the acquisition of
fluorescence and photobleaching images were done by C.D.-B. and R.T.-M.
with the help of M.F.-A. and G.M.-V. All the authors contributed to
the discussion of the paper and approved the manuscript. G.M.-V. and
M.F.-A. directed the project.
