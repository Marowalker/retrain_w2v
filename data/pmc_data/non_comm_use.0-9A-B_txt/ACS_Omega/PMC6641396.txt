A C/SiO2 composite was
produced from 3-aminophenol and
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) by a synthesis protocol that involved
microwave irradiation. This protocol featured simultaneous 3-aminophenol
polymerization and TEOS hydrolysis and condensation, which were achieved
rapidly in a microwave reactor. The SiO2 component was
formed from low-concentration TEOS confined in cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide micelles. We demonstrated a control of the SiO2 particle size, ranging from 20 to 90 nm, by varying the 3-aminophenol
concentration. The carbon component provided a microporous structure
that greatly contributed to the high specific surface area, 375 m2/g, and served as a host for the nitrogen functional groups
with a content of 5.34%, 74% of which were pyridinic type. The composite
formation mechanism was clarified from time-series scanning electron
microscopy images and dynamic light scattering analysis. An understanding
of the composite formation mechanism in this protocol will enable
the design of composite morphologies for specific applications.

1 Introduction
The
unique characteristics of carbon, such as high mechanical strength,1 high electrical conductivity,2 tunable properties,3 and its
low cost, have led to its extensive use in many fields. The widespread
applications of carbon have attracted in-depth studies of this material
with the aim of functional improvements. One area of interest is structural
modification, which encompasses the morphology and chemical structure.
Work aimed at engineering the morphological structure has established
synthesis protocols for various carbon structures, e.g., dense, porous,
hollow, and fibrous.3−6 Methods for modification of the chemical structure range from the
atomic scale, e.g., heteroatom doping, to the macro scale, e.g., composite
formation. Composites of carbon with other materials such as metals
or metal oxides are particularly attractive because of the growing
demand for high-performance devices that need to combine the features
of more than one material.

SiO2 is a common constituent
of carbon composites. SiO2 is used in many products because
of its natural abundance,
thermal stability, and dielectric properties.7,8 Previous
research on the synthesis of C/SiO2 composites has led
to improved electrical properties, microwave absorption, metal immobilization,
and resistance to organic solvents.9−14 There are three possible approaches to the synthesis of general
carbon/silicon oxide composites. The first involves mechanical mixing
of presynthesized materials such as silicon oxide nanoparticles and
graphite.15,16 In the second approach, a presynthesized
material such as SiO2 nanoparticles is combined with a
raw material such as sucrose as the carbon source.17 Although composite synthesis using presynthesized materials
is generally simple, control of the constituent morphology and characteristics
is easier when the raw materials for both constituents are used as
the starting materials; this is the third possible approach. The challenge
is to develop a simple, rapid method for composite synthesis that
gives good control of the composite structure.

For C/SiO2 composite formation, the Stöber method
can be used to synthesize SiO2 from alkoxysilanes such
as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). A method based on the same principle
is also effective for the synthesis of carbon from 3-aminophenol.18,19 Recently, our group improved this method by using microwave irradiation
to accelerate polymerization of carbon source monomers, namely 3-aminophenol
and hexa(methoxymethyl)melamine, to give nitrogen-doped hollow carbon
spheres.20,21

In the present study, we used a combination
of SiO2 production
from TEOS by the Stöber method and carbon production from 3-aminophenol
to synthesize a C/SiO2 composite with a controllable SiO2 particle size. The synthesis protocol features rapid 3-aminophenol
polymerization simultaneously with hydrolysis-condensation of TEOS
under microwave irradiation. The controllable SiO2 particle
size enables more flexible design of the carbon/SiO2 interface
area, which is a critical consideration in some applications. We also
used time-series images of the morphological structure and dynamic
light scattering (DLS) to investigate the composite formation mechanism
in this synthesis protocol. An understanding of the composite formation
mechanism will enable future improvements in composite morphology
design.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Composite
Formation Mechanism
In
this protocol, the carbon and SiO2 components were synthesized
simultaneously in a microwave reactor. Observation of the changes
in the particle morphology under microwave irradiation therefore provided
an effective approach to clarifying the composite formation mechanism.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the particle samples
during microwave irradiation were therefore obtained. Figure 1a shows the images for samples
taken at four different times, following the pattern described in Figure 1b.

Figure 1 (a) Composite formation
mechanism explained by changes in particle
morphology after microwave irradiation at 40 °C for 7 min (step
I) and 15 min (step II), at 80 °C for 10 min (step III) and 30
min (step IV), and after carbonization; (b) microwave heating pattern,
showing times at which samples were taken; and (c) changes in ζ-potential
during 3-aminophenol polymerization.

3-Aminophenol was considered to be homogenously nucleated
before
entering the reactor, as in our previous study.22 Simultaneously, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles
were formed, with the hydrophobic tail attracted to ethanol. Formaldehyde
and TEOS were introduced into the solution at the same time. Polymerization
of 3-aminophenol was initiated immediately after the addition of formaldehyde,
and TEOS was stabilized inside the CTAB micelles. Hydrolysis of TEOS
was slower than 3-aminophenol polymerization; therefore, TEOS was
unreacted when 3-aminophenol polymerization started. Figure 1c shows that the ζ-potential
of the 3-aminophenol polymer changed with microwave irradiation time.
The ζ-potential of the polymer was positive at the beginning
of polymerization because the dominant charge came from the amine
group;22 the CTAB micelle ζ-potential
(25 mV) was also positive because CTAB is a cationic surfactant. As
a consequence of having identical charges, the 3-aminophenol polymer
and CTAB micelles were independent before microwave irradiation, as
shown in the inset in Figure 1c.

Composite formation under microwave irradiation was
divided into
four stages, according to sampling time. The first sample was taken
after microwave irradiation for 7 min at 40 °C. Figure 1c shows that the ζ-potential
of the 3-aminophenol polymer changed to negative after irradiation
for approximately 6 min and therefore had a charge opposite to that
of the CTAB micelles. The change in the ζ-potential was stimulated
by the formation of OH– groups on the polymer surface.22 Consequently, the CTAB micelles were electrostatically
attracted to the 3-aminophenol polymer and were deposited on its surface.
This is confirmed by the presence of trace SiO2 seeds on
the surface of the 3-aminophenol polymer in the SEM image of the first
stage in Figure 1a.
The presence of SiO2 seeds also indicates that TEOS hydrolysis
had already started.

The growth of SiO2 nanoparticles
continued as microwave
irradiation was sustained. In the second stage, the particle surfaces
became rough as more SiO2 seeds were attached and grew
on the polymer surface. In the third stage, the heating temperature
was increased to 80 °C, which resulted in higher rates of TEOS
hydrolysis and condensation. However, the polymerization of 3-aminophenol
continued concurrently with the growth of SiO2. The growing
3-aminophenol polymer concealed the SiO2 nanoparticles.
The composite surface was therefore smoother in the third stage than
in the second stage, as seen in Figure 1a.

Our previous research22 showed that
the size of the 3-aminophenol polymer increased to a certain maximum
value before shrinking in the final stage of polymerization. Shrinkage
of the 3-aminophenol polymer is the reason for the surfacing of SiO2 nanoparticles after microwave irradiation for 30 min at 80
°C, as seen in the SEM images for stage IV.

Carbonization
caused further shrinkage and the composite particle
size decreased from 1025 to 715 nm. It was the carbon constituent
that shrank. The heat applied during carbonization and the decrease
in the carbon volume caused SiO2 agglomeration after carbonization,
as shown in Figure 1a. The final SiO2 particle size was approximately 65 nm.

Another relevant point is that the SiO2 nanoparticles
were much smaller than the CTAB micelles. DLS measurements showed
that the average CTAB micelle size was approximately 120 nm. A supporting
experiment involving neither 3-aminophenol nor formaldehyde gave SiO2 particles of size close to that of the micelles. This suggests
that the SiO2 particles and micelles were of similar size.
The smaller SiO2 particle size in the composite can be
ascribed to electrostatic interactions between CTAB micelles and the
3-aminophenol polymer. As mentioned earlier, the ζ-potential
of the 3-aminophenol polymer changed with polymerization time because
of changes in the dominant functional group. The inconsistent ζ-potential
disturbed the electrostatic system in the solution, and this affected
the micelle stability. The disturbed electrostatic system induced
the formation of smaller aggregates on the polymer surface.23

An important point is that CTAB played
a critical role in composite
formation in this synthesis protocol. We performed an in-depth study
of this issue by observing the effect of the CTAB concentration on
composite formation, as shown in Figure 2. In the absence of CTAB, no SiO2 was observed on the carbon particles, as shown in Figure 2a. CTAB is a cationic surfactant
and is therefore positively charged, which facilitates attraction
to the negatively charged polymer. However, no free SiO2 particles were found in the absence of CTAB. On the basis of this
finding, an additional experiment was conducted in which SiO2 particles were prepared by the Stöber method but with microwave
irradiation instead of conventional heating. The concentration of
TEOS used in this additional experiment was the same as that used
in the synthesis of the SiO2/C composite. Unlike the case
in previous research, no SiO2 particles were obtained from
this experimental protocol, probably because of the low TEOS concentration
(Figure S1).24 However, SiO2 was successfully synthesized when CTAB
was added to the system. These results imply that CTAB not only assisted
the deposition of SiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of
the 3-aminophenol polymer but also facilitated SiO2 formation
by concentrating TEOS in the micelles.

Figure 2 Morphologies of particles
synthesized with addition of (a) 0 g,
(b) 0.25 g, (c) 0.5 g, and (d) 1 g of CTAB.

Figure 2b
shows
traces of SiO2 nanoparticles on the surface of the 3-aminophenol
polymer when a small amount (0.25 g) of CTAB was added to the composite
precursor. Increasing the CTAB concentration resulted in the presence
of more SiO2 on the particle surface, as shown in the insets
in Figure 2c,d, but
the numbers of SiO2 particles in Figure 2c,d are comparable. This is a reasonable
trend because the number of micelles in the precursor solution generally
increased with increasing CTAB concentration. However, the micellar
properties of CTAB in the ethanol–water system tend to be constant
at high CTAB concentrations.25

2.2 Control of SiO2 Nanoparticle Size
and Composite Characteristics
In this study, the stability
of the CTAB micelles was altered by changes in the electrostatic system
caused by formation of a 3-aminophenol polymer. In line with this
finding, DLS measurements showed that the CTAB micelle size decreased
with increasing amount of 3-aminophenol added, indicating an affinity
of CTAB micelles for 3-aminophenol (Figure S2). This phenomenon, which is the result of interactions between the
CTAB micelles and the 3-aminophenol monomer and polymer, was used
to tailor the SiO2 nanoparticle size.

Figure 3 shows the morphologies of
composites synthesized with various 3-aminophenol concentrations before
and after carbonization. The amount of CTAB used was 0.5 g. A summary
of the composite and SiO2 particle sizes as a function
of 3-aminophenol concentration is provided in Figure 4a. Increasing the 3-aminophenol concentration
resulted in larger composite particles because of the increased fraction
of the carbon constituent. This result is in accordance with those
of our previous research on the synthesis of hollow carbon particles
from 3-aminophenol.22 The results also
show that the SiO2 nanoparticle size decreased with increasing
3-aminophenol concentration. DLS measurements of the 3-aminophenol
polymer ζ-potential showed that the ζ-potential is independent
of 3-aminophenol concentration.18 This
suggests that the ζ-potential could disrupt the micellar morphology
by breaking it into smaller aggregates but does not determine the
final SiO2 particle size. Previous studies showed that
the micellar shape and size can be changed by increasing the ionic
activity, e.g., by salt addition.26 The
same phenomenon could occur in the 3-aminophenol system, triggering
changes in the SiO2 particle size when the amount of 3-aminophenol
is changed. In addition, the size of the 3-aminophenol polymer increased
with increasing 3-aminophenol concentration. This results in a larger
available surface for SiO2 seed deposition and promotes
homogeneous deposition and better SiO2 dispersion.

(a–d) and C/SiO2 composites (e–h) synthesized
with different 3-aminophenol concentrations: 12 μM (a, e), 24
μM (b, f), 36 μM (c, g), and 48 μM (d, h).

Figure 4 (a) Effect of 3-aminophenol concentration on
SiO2 and
composite particle size, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of C/SiO2 composite synthesized using 3-aminophenol
concentrations of (b) 24 μM and (c) 48 μM.

The TEM images in Figure 4b,c show apparent dispersion of SiO2 nanoparticles.
However, it is difficult to distinguish SiO2 nanoparticles
on the surface and inside the composite. Carbon was removed from the
composite structure and the effect of TEOS concentration on the SiO2 structure was studied to facilitate observation of SiO2 nanoparticle dispersion. Carbon was removed by calcination
at the temperature at which sintering was estimated to be minimum.
Minimum sintering was expected to prevent SiO2 movement
out of the initial structure on carbon removal. The results are shown
in Figure 5. Figure 4b,c suggests that
the SiO2 nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface.
However, hardly any nanoparticles were present inside the composite
as Figure 5 shows hollow
SiO2 particles with porous shells. The interior of the
shell is shown by red dashed lines in Figure 5d–f. The formation of hollow SiO2 particles implies that the core of the composite consisted
mainly of carbon. This supports the proposed composite formation mechanism
in which 3-aminophenol was polymerized prior to attracting SiO2 seeds confined in the CTAB micelles, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 5 SEM (a–c) and
TEM (d–f) images after calcination
of composites with 3-aminophenol/TEOS ratios of (a, d) 1:0.25, (b,
e) 1:0.5, and (c, f) 1:1.

The SEM and TEM images in Figure 5 also show that the SiO2 nanoparticles
served
as the shell, which thickened with increasing TEOS concentration,
regardless of the concentration of TEOS used in the synthesis. Shell
thickening led to a denser shell structure. The morphology of the
calcined composite suggests that this route is also promising for
the synthesis of hollow SiO2 particles with mesoporous
shells. The composite formation mechanism is summarized in Figure 6 on the basis of
the effects of the CTAB and 3-aminophenol concentrations.

Figure 6 Summary of
composite formation and effect of precursor composition
on composite morphology.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to identify
the composite constituents. The C/SiO2 composite synthesized
using a 3-aminophenol concentration of 24 μM was used as an
example. Figure 7a
shows the core level Si 2p XP spectrum. Gaussian fitting shows a peak
centroid at a binding energy of 102.35 eV. The binding energy for
SiO2 is 103.8 eV, but the observed value is closer to the
binding energy for a siloxane, i.e., ≡Si–O–Si≡
(102.30 eV) or to those for silicon oxides with O/Si atoms less than
2, e.g., SiO1.24 (102.4 eV).27 However, the formation of substoichiometric silicon oxide is improbable
because heating was performed in a mild environment in which reduction
of SiO2 was unlikely.28,29 This suggests
that the observed binding energy can probably be assigned to siloxane,
which is an intermediate in TEOS hydrolysis and condensation.30 This implies that the SiO2 synthesized
using this synthesis protocol is noncrystalline and contains traces
of intermediates.

Figure 7 XP spectra: (a) Si 2p, which shows binding energy of 102.35
eV,
and (b) N 1s, with contents of nitrogen functional groups.

Previous research has shown the possibility of
preserving the nitrogen
atom of 3-aminophenol during polymerization and carbonization to give
nitrogen-doped carbon structures. The elemental analysis results in Table 1 show that the nitrogen
content in the composite was 5.34% after carbonization. The N 1s XP
spectra in Figure 7b show that the carbon constituent contained 74% pyridinic nitrogen
and 26% pyrrolic or amino nitrogen. This characteristic is particularly
beneficial for electrochemical applications, which take advantage
of the free electrons in nitrogen functional groups. It is important
to note that the elemental analysis results in Table 1 cannot be used to determine the O/Si atomic
ratio because some of the O atoms are present in amorphous carbon.

and after Carbonization

The carbon constituent not only served as an anchor
for nitrogen
functional groups but also provided a porous structure. The pores
in the carbon are mainly formed from gas released during precursor
decomposition.4 The presence of pores is
confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm, which
shows a combination of monolayer–multilayer adsorption in the
presence of micropores (Figure 8a); the SBET is 375 m2/g. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda analysis of the results
(Figure 8b) shows a
dominant pore size of 1.22 nm, with a total pore volume of 0.18 cm3/g.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Composite
Synthesis
All chemicals
used in this work were analytical grade and used as received without
further purification. Typically, an aqueous solution was prepared
by stirring 3-aminophenol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), ammonia
solution (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and ultrapure water
at room temperature until a clear solution was obtained. Cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in ethanol
was added to the solution and the mixture was stirred for 15 min.
TEOS (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and formaldehyde (Kanto
Chemical Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were simultaneously added to the
solution. The mixture was subjected to microwave irradiation (μ-Reactor,
Shikokukeisokukogyo, Kagawa, Japan) with the temperature being set
at 40 °C. After 15 min, the temperature was elevated to 80 °C
and kept constant for 60 min. The obtained particles were separated
from the solution by centrifugation and washed several times with
ultrapure water and ethanol to remove the remaining impurities. After
drying, the particles were carbonized by heat treatment in a nitrogen
atmosphere (0.5 L/min) for 3 h at 550 °C. Details of the conditions
for sample preparation are summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

3.2 Physical
Characterization
The morphologies
of the synthesized C/SiO2 composites were examined using
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (S-5000, 20 kV, Hitachi
High-Tech. Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM; JEM-2010, 200 kV, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The ζ-potential
and micelle size were determined by DLS (Zetasizer Nano ZSP, Malvern
Instruments Ltd., Malvern, U.K.). Elemental analysis was performed
using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI Quantera II, Physical
Electronics, Chanhassen, MN). The thermal behaviors before and after
calcination were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-50/51
Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
properties of the C/SiO2 composites were investigated with
gas adsorption measurement equipment (BELSORP-max, MicrotracBEL Corp.,
Osaka, Japan), and the surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method from the nitrogen isotherm curve.

4 Conclusions
A protocol for the rapid synthesis of C/SiO2 composites
was developed. The use of raw materials, i.e., TEOS and 3-aminophenol
instead of presynthesized materials enabled better control of the
SiO2 nanoparticle morphology. This opens up a wide range
of future applications. In this synthesis protocol, the cationic surfactant
CTAB plays an important role, not only in composite formation but
also in the hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS. Polymerization of
3-aminophenol and hydrolysis and condensation of TEOS were performed
simultaneously, assisted by microwave irradiation to accelerate the
reaction. Nitrogen doping is an additional feature of this method
and is beneficial for applications involving electron transfer.
