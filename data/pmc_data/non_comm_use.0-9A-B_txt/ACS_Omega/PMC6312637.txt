A series
of novel chalcone and thiol-Michael addition analogues was synthesized
and tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other clinically significant bacterial pathogens. Previously
reported chalcone-like antibacterials (1a–c and 2) were used as a training set to generate
a pharmacophore model. The chalcone derivative hit compound 3 was subsequently identified through a pharmacophore-based
virtual screen of the Specs library of >200 000 compounds.
Among the newly synthesized chalcones and thiol-Michael addition analogues,
chalcones 6r and 6s were active (minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) = 1.56–6.25 μg/mL) against
Gram-positive pathogens Bacillus anthracis and Staphylococcus aureus [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)]. The chalcone thiol-Michael addition
derivatives 7j–m showed good to excellent
antibacterial activities (MICs = 0.78–6.25 μg/mL) against Enterococcus faecalis, B. anthracis, and S. aureus. Interestingly, the
amine-Michael addition analogue 12a showed promising
anti-MRSA activity (MIC = 1.56 μg/mL) with a selectivity index
of 14 toward mammalian Vero cells. In addition, evaluation of selected
compounds against biofilm and planktonic S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA) revealed that 12a exhibited bactericidal
activities in these assays, which was overall superior to vancomycin.
These properties may result from the compounds dissipating the proton
motive force of bacterial membranes.

1 Introduction
The
emergence of antimicrobial resistance presents a serious threat to
global public health,1,2 requiring the discovery and development
of new classes of antimicrobial agents. According to the World Health
Organization, there are high proportions of antibiotic resistance
in bacteria that cause common infections (e.g., urinary tract infections,
pneumonia, and bloodstream infections) in all regions of the world.3−5 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria cause a number
of serious, hard-to-treat hospital-acquired infections.6,7 Tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is also another difficult-to-treat infection, which is becoming
more problematic due to the increase in multidrug-resistant strains.8 Hence, there is an urgent medical need to develop
new and effective antibacterial agents to counteract the threat of
antimicrobial resistance to the available drugs.

As part of
our antibacterial research program, we have been focusing on the synthesis
and evaluation of 4-chromanone and chalcone derivatives.9,10 Synthetic and natural chalcones are known to mediate diverse biological
and pharmacological properties, including antibacterial,11−14 antifungal,15 and antitubercular16 activities. For example, we previously reported
a chalcone compound 2 (Figure 1) with good antibacterial activities (minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 3.13 μg/mL) against S. aureus (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA),9 whereas Sriram and co-workers reported a series of chalcone-derived
pyrazoline compounds 1a–c (Figure 1) with activities
against M. tuberculosis H37Rv and an
isoniazid-resistant strain.17

Figure 1 Structures
and feature alignment of antibacterial pyrazolines 1a–c, chalcone 2, and pharmacophore
search hit compound 3.

Given the structural similarity between chalcones and chalcone-derived
pyrazolines (1a–c), we generated
a three-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore model for ligand-based virtual
screening to identify scaffolds for designing novel antibacterials.
Herein, we discuss the generation and validation of a chemical feature-based
pharmacophore model using 1a–c and 2 and subsequent use of the model to query the Specs screening
collection library (www.specs.net) of >200 000 compounds. A promising chalcone-like hit
compound 3 (Figure 1) was identified from a four-point pharmacophore search
of the Specs screening collection. The pyrazolines 1a–c, chalcone 2, and virtual screen
hit 3 share notable pharmacophoric features, including
two overlapping hydrogen bond acceptors (dashed circles in red) and
two overlapping aromatic rings (dashed squares in blue) (Figure 1). Inspired by this
virtual screen hit 3, along with our previously reported
antibacterial chalcone 2,9 a series of chalcones and thiol-/amine-Michael addition analogues
were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities
against a select panel of bacterial pathogens. An illuminating and
expanded structure–activity relationship (SAR) was obtained.
Moreover, the new chemical space and the additional SAR insights generated
from this study allowed for the refinement and subsequent application
of an expanded five-point pharmacophore model.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Pharmacophore Modeling
On the basis of antibacterial chalcone-derived pyrazolines 1a–c17 and
chalcone 2(9) (Figure 1), we developed and validated
a three-dimensional pharmacophore model using Phase software in the
Schrödinger Drug Discovery Suite.18−20 A training
set composed of pyrazolines 1a–c and
chalcone 2 was used to generate several pharmacophore
hypotheses. Phase software uses a common pharmacophore perception
algorithm to generate pharmacophore hypotheses based upon conformational
alignment of pharmacophore features (acceptor, donor, hydrophobic,
negative ionic, positive ionic, aromatic ring) using a training set
of known actives. Conformational generation, ionization, and tautomeric
sampling were performed during model generation, relegating the need
for manual compound alignments. The scoring function, PhaseHypoScore,
was used to rank the hypotheses generated using an internal validation
method; external validation can also be applied using a decoy library
and active compounds not used in the model generation. As shown in Figure 2a, a lead four-point
pharmacophore hypothesis was selected from the hypotheses generated
by Phase using these four training compounds. The hypothesis consists
of two aromatic ring features and two hydrogen bond acceptor features.
The overlaid compounds 1a and 2 are shown
in Figure 2a. We note
that in the generation of the pharmacophore models, both the R- and
S-stereoisomers of the pyrazoline compounds were investigated. The
R-isomer was ultimately selected based on the highest-ranking pharmacophore
model generated.

bond acceptors. (b) The 3D feature alignment of 3 (magenta)

2.2 Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening
In the absence of known target structural information, ligand-based
virtual screening methods, such as quantitative SAR and pharmacophore
screening, may be employed to identify novel active compounds. These
methods seek to identify compounds that possess, or match, known features
required for activity on a set of characterized active compounds (e.g.,
a training set). Following the generation and validation of the four-point
pharmacophore model described above (Figure 2a), we conducted a pharmacophore-based virtual
screen of the Specs screening collection library, consisting of over
200 000 unique compounds. The screening collection was prepared
and screened as discussed below in the Experimental
Section. To be classified as a hit, a compound was required
to match all four pharmacophore features of the model. The screen
resulted in a large number of hits that were sorted by scoring rank
and scaffold analysis. Visual inspection of high-scoring compounds
with unique chemical scaffolds led to the identification of the hit
compound 3 (Figures 1 and 2b).

2.3 Chemistry
The synthesis of chalcone-like analogues
(6–9) was carried out using base-catalyzed
Claisen–Schmidt condensation between an appropriate acetophenone 4 and a substituted benzaldehyde 5 (Scheme 1). The hydroxyl functionality
on commercially available acetophenones was first protected using
MOMCl, affording OMOM protected 4a–d.9 In these cases, the OMOM group was
subsequently removed after Claisen–Schmidt condensation, providing
access to chalcones 6. With 6 in hand, we
performed thiol-Michael addition reactions using different thiophenols
in EtOH and diethylamine (DEA) to afford 7. When required,
removal of the MOM groups was conducted in the presence of hydrochloric
acid/tetrahydrofuran (THF)/i-PrOH (1:5:5), providing
the free phenol derivatives. To evaluate the impact of the thioether
functionality on antibacterial activity of 7, compounds 7a and 7b were further oxidized to their sulfone
derivatives 8a and 8b using meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) in dichloromethane
(DCM). Moreover, the α,β-unsaturated double bonds of 2 and 6p were reduced using palladium on carbon
(Pd/C) and H2 to yield 9a and 9b, respectively.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Chalcones and Derivatives 6–9
Next, to further study the importance of phenylthio and
phenylsulfone groups in 7 and 8, three phenylamino
counterparts in 12a–c were also synthesized.
As shown in Scheme 2, the phenylamino analogues 12a–c were synthesized using the Mannich reaction among 4-chloroaniline 10, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde 11, and a substituted
hydroxyacetophenone in EtOH and HCl (cat) under reflux. The crystal
structure of 12a is shown in Figure 3.

2.4 Biology
The newly synthesized chalcones
and derivatives were tested for their antibacterial activities; the
results are shown in Table 1.

ref (9).

f CHL = chloramphenicol.

2.4.1 Antituberculosis Activity
and Antimicrobial Spectra
As shown in Table 1, all synthesized compounds were largely
inactive against M. tuberculosis when
tested at 100 μg/mL, except N-substituted chalcone derivatives 12b–c that showed moderate activities
(MIC = 50 μg/mL). Antibacterial evaluation against a select
panel of clinically relevant pathogens indicated that some of our
synthesized compounds showed excellent activities against Gram-positive Bacillus anthracis and S. aureus. However, all compounds were inactive against Gram-negative A. baumannii, E. coli (K12, wild-type strain), K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. It should be
noted that when tested against the efflux-pump-deficient E. coli (ΔtolC) strain,21 the chemical series of chalcones 6j and 6m–o with a disubstituted A-ring
motif (R1 = OH and R2 = CH3) showed
moderate to good activity (6j, 12.5 μg/mL; 6m and 6o, 6.25 μg/mL; 6n,
3.125 μg/mL). In addition, the chemical series (12a and 12c, MIC = 6.25 μg/mL; 12b,
MIC = 50 μg/mL) was also active against E. coli (ΔtolC). These data suggest that these two
subseries from 6 and 12 may be subject to
an efflux-pump-mediated resistance mechanism, leading to their overall
lack of activity against Gram-negative bacteria.

2.4.2 Anti-Gram-Positive Activity
On the basis of the SAR, important structural features were found to be required
for anti-Gram-positive activity. In the chalcone series 6, a disubstituted A-ring (R1 = OH and R2 =
CH3) produced active compounds (e.g., 6n and 6o, MIC = 1.56 μg/mL) with more selective antibacterial
activity against B. anthracis. Compounds 6j and 6m bearing the same A-ring motif also
showed moderate activity (MIC = 12.5 μg/mL) against B. anthracis. In addition, consistent with our previous
SAR studies,9,10 at least one free hydroxyl group
at the disubstituted A-ring was generally required for activity by
comparing the SAR data between 6j (R1 = OH,
R2 = CH3) and 6i (R1 = OMOM, R2 = CH3) or 6f (R1 = F, R2 = CH3). Specifically, 6j with R1 substituted hydroxyl functionality had
a MIC value of 12.5 μg/mL against B. anthracis; however, blocking this functionality with a MOM protecting group
(6i) or substituting it with fluorine (6f) led to the loss of activity (MIC > 200 μg/mL) against B. anthracis. This suggested that a free phenolic
OH group, in addition to a disubstituted A-ring, is generally important
for anti-Gram-positive activity. Furthermore, 2 bearing
dihydroxylated groups at the R1 and R3 positions
displayed very good antibacterial activities against S. aureus (29213), S. aureus (NRS70), and Enterococcus faecalis with MIC values of 3.125, 3.125, and 25 μg/mL, respectively.
However, its activity was destroyed (MICs > 100 μg/mL) by
removal of either hydroxyl group to form the monohydroxylated analogue 6v (R1 = OH) or 6w (R3 =
OH).

When the A-ring in chemical series 6 has two
hydroxyl substituents (R1 = R3 = OH), changing
the tertiary amine functionality at the R4 position of
B-ring had a marked effect on the activities and selectivity against
Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. For example, analogues having diethylamine
(6s), 4-methylpiperidine (6r), and 1-piperidine
(2) at the R4 position were the most active
among the series and had MICs of 1.56–6.25 μg/mL against B. anthracis and/or S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). In contrast, compounds with morpholine (6p), 4-methylpiperazine (6q), and 4-phenylpiperazine (6u) as well as 2-pyridinyl (6x) moieties at the
R4 position were inactive against these organisms presumably
due to the increased hydrophilicity and decreased cellular membrane
penetration.

The α,β-unsaturated linker between
rings A and B in 2 was found to be important for antibacterial
activity. Reducing the double bond resulted in the complete loss of
antibacterial activity as seen by a comparison of SAR data with reduced
analogue 9a. The loss in activity may be due to the lack
of Michael acceptor motif and/or forming a more flexible scaffold,
which would incur a higher entropic penalty when binding to a cellular
target.

In agreement with the SAR pattern of series 6 discussed above, the SAR data generated from the phenylthioether
series 7 also confirmed that a hydroxyl functionality
on ring A is critical for antibacterial activity. Compounds 7j–m generally displayed good to excellent
antibacterial activities (MICs: 0.78–6.25 μg/mL) against B. anthracis, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and B.
subtilis. These compounds also showed moderate activity
(25 μg/mL) against S. pneumoniae. Blocking the R1 hydroxyl group in 7j with
a MOM group (7i) led to the loss of antibacterial activity.
This supported earlier SAR observation from series 6,
showing the importance of the free hydroxyl substituent on ring A.
In addition, compounds 7a–i, without
the corresponding hydroxyl functionality on ring A, were largely inactive
against all test bacterial strains. The sulfone compounds (8a and 8b) lacking the hydroxyl group on A-ring only showed
moderate activity (MIC = 50 μg/mL) against E.
faecalis.

Finally, compared to thiol-Michael
addition derivatives 7j–m, compounds 12a and 12c with the monohydroxylated A-ring
and the corresponding amine functionality (NH) showed overall comparable
activities (MICs: 1.56–3.125 μg/mL) against B. anthracis and S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA). Nevertheless, 12b with the dihydroxylated
A-ring showed notably decreased anti-Gram-positive activities with
MICs ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 μg/mL. The SAR summary is shown
in Figure 4.

2.4.4 Anti-Staphylococcal
Properties
The antibacterial activities of selected compounds
were explored in terms of their ability to kill growing and nongrowing
MRSA and MSSA strains (Table 3). Compounds 6s, 7m, and 12a displayed activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus MN8 and NRS70 and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus UAMS-1 and Newman. To determine whether
their activities were bactericidal, representative strains MN8 and
Newman were tested. Compounds 6s and 12a were the most potent, killing S. aureus at minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of 6.25–25
μg/mL, with the least potent 7m killing at 50–100
μg/mL. Since the compounds had bactericidal properties, we next
examined whether they could eradicate preformed biofilm cells, which
are among the hardest of staphylococcal types to kill. Most antimicrobials
in current clinical use, including vancomycin, gentamicin, daptomycin,
and ciprofloxacin, are unable to eradicate staphylococcal biofilms,
even at high concentrations (e.g., >256 mg/L).22 Biofilms from MN8, NRS70, UAMS-1, and Newman were established
in the 96-well plates for 24 h, followed by washing to remove nonadherent
cells. As expected, the biofilms were refractory to killing by vancomycin
at minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) of >200 μg/mL.
However, as shown in Table 3, 12a could kill strains at MBEC 25–50
μg/mL when residing in a biofilm state. Its analogue 7m was less potent, but killed biofilms at MBEC 50–200 μg/mL.
Although the chalcone compound 6s was also slightly less
potent than 12a, it eradicated biofilms at MBEC 50–100
μg/mL. This suggests that eradication of staphylococcal biofilms
by this compound class is superior to vancomycin and likely other
antibacterials.22

2.4.5 Mode
of Action of Selected Compounds
Compounds 6s, 7m, and 12a have c Log P values of 4.68, 7.29, and 5.94, respectively. Since lipophilic
compounds are prone to interact with bacterial cytoplasmic membranes,
resulting in dissipation of their proton motive force (PMF),23 we evaluated whether these compounds affected
the staphylococcal PMF. For this purpose, we used the membrane potential
fluorescent probe DiBAC4(3) bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric
acid) trimethine oxonol, which enters cells in response to decreases
in the membrane potentials, and it is monitored by its increasing
green fluorescence.24 Against S. aureus Newman, the membrane-active control reutericyclin-86723 dissipated the membrane potential, as shown
by an increase in green fluorescence for cells, whereas the peptidoglycan
synthesis inhibitor vancomycin had no effect (Figure 5). Conversely, cells exposed to 16×
the MIC for compounds 6s and 12a showed
a decrease in fluorescence, suggesting that they dissipated the transmembrane
pH. In an effort to maintain the PMF, bacteria will increase their
membrane potentials to compensate for the dissipation of the transmembrane
pH component.25 This may explain the lower
fluorescence of DiBAC4(3) in cells exposed to 6s and 12a. Interestingly, at 16× the MIC, 7m did not appear to affect the transmembrane pH, but rather
it lowered the membrane potential, indicating that chemical modifications
to the compounds might alter their interaction with the bacterial
membrane bilayer. These results suggest that the membrane lipid bilayer
is the likely target for chalcone derivatives, consistent with our
prior studies and the role of the hydroxyl group in proton ionophore-related
antibacterial activity.9 Since the PMF
is integral for energy generation and maintenance of cellular homeostasis,26 its disruption may be the basis for bactericidal
activities of these compounds against planktonic and biofilm cells.

Figure 5 Effects

with excitation at 488 nm and emission recorded using filters for
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Controls are: untreated; vancomycin
(20 μg/mL); reutericyclin-867 (100 μg/mL). Compounds 6s (100 μg/mL), 12a (12.5 μg/mL),
and 7m (50 μg/mL) were analyzed at 16× their
respective MIC against strain Newman. Compound 7m had
no significant effect at 1× and 4× its MIC, whereas 6s and 12a had similar effects on the PMF as
shown above.

2.5 Expanded
Pharmacophore Model
Part of our rationale for selecting hit
compound 3 for further study was the observation of a
possible fifth pharmacophore match (aromatic ring system) between 3 and the pyrazoline series 1a–c that suggested an unexplored region of chemical space to expand
the SAR of the chalcone analogues further. Subsequent SAR observations
showed a general preference for the hydroxyl group on ring A over
the methoxy group as seen in 3. These observations led
us to develop and validate a refined, five-point pharmacophore model
(Figure 6) for further
pharmacophore-based virtual screening. This model included the additional
aromatic ring feature seen in the hit molecule and pyrazoline series,
along with a modified hydrogen bond acceptor feature to a donor feature
on the A-ring in accordance with our SAR observations. The results
of follow-up screening campaigns using this model are currently pending.

Figure 6 Five-point
pharmacophore model developed using 1a (teal), 2 (green), and representative active compound 7j (magenta). The additional aromatic ring feature is common to the
pyrazoline compounds and thiol-Michael addition compounds 7j–m. The A-ring acceptor in the original four-point
model is revised to a donor in this model. The tolerances (spheres)
of the acceptor and donor features and one ring feature have been
tightened to 1.5 Å in this model.

3 Conclusions
Inspired by pharmacophore
modeling, a series of chalcones and thiol-/amine-Michael addition
analogues were designed and synthesized. Antibacterial evaluation
revealed that a disubstituted A-ring with R1 hydroxy and
R2 methyl groups in the chalcone series 6 produced
active compounds (e.g., 6n and 6o, MIC =
1.56 μg/mL) with more selective antibacterial activity against B. anthracis. Chalcones 6r and 6s also showed anti-Gram-positive activities against B. anthracis, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), and B. subtilis with
MICs ranging from 1.56 to 6.25 μg/mL. The α,β-unsaturated
linker between rings A and B was also found to be important for antibacterial
activity. SAR evaluation on series 7 confirmed that a
hydroxyl functionality on ring A was also critical for activity. The
thiol-Michael addition derivatives 7j–m showed good to excellent antibacterial activities against E. faecalis, B. anthracis, and both MSSA and MRSA S. aureus strains with MICs of 0.78–6.25 μg/mL. Compounds 12a and 12c with the monohydroxylated A-ring
and the corresponding amine functionality showed overall comparable
activities against B. anthracis and S. aureus (MICs: 1.56–3.125 μg/mL),
with 12a being the least cytotoxic agent in our series
against Vero cells (SI = 14). Furthermore, 12a showed
potent anti-biofilm properties against known biofilm forming S. aureus strains, with MBECs of 25–50 μg/mL.
The SAR insights from these investigations have allowed for the development
of an expanded activity hypothesis that will be investigated using
the refined pharmacophore model in future studies.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Pharmacophore Modeling
4.1.1 Pharmacophore Model Generation
All calculations were
performed using the Schrödinger Small-Molecule Drug Discovery
Suite and Phase pharmacophore modeling software.18−20 Known antibacterial
pyrazolines 1a–c and chalcone 2 (Figure 1) were used to generate the pharmacophore models. The compounds were
built using Schrödinger’s Maestro interface and minimized
using the OPLS3e force field.27 As noted
above, models were generated using the R- and S-stereoisomers of the
pyrazoline training compounds. The training compound conformations
were generated by software (target number 50) with output conformations
minimized. Pharmacophore features used included acceptor (A), donor
(D), hydrophobic (H), negative ionic (N), positive ionic (P), and
aromatic ring (R); no custom features were used. Four-point pharmacophore
model hypotheses were generated; all training compounds were required
to match the generated pharmacophore models. The top-ten scoring models
were returned by software.

4.1.2 Pharmacophore Model Validation
The pharmacophore models generated by Phase software were validated
internally using the PhaseHypoScore scoring function and the four
training compounds themselves with a 1000-compound decoy set provided
in the Schrödinger package (360 Da molecular weight average).18−20 The score returned is essentially a linear sum describing how well
the active compounds match the hypothesis generated and the hypothesis
performance on a virtual screen of the decoy library seeded with the
active (training) compounds. The models were further validated externally
using four active pyrazoline compounds 1d–g17 (Figure 7) seeded into the Schrödinger decoy
library. The final four-point model used for pharmacophore screening
was selected on the basis of internal and external validation metrics,
including PhaseHypoScore, 1% enrichment factor, BEDROC analysis,28 and visual inspection of the pharmacophore alignment.

validation compounds. Four active pyrazolines 1d–g reported by Shaharyar et al.17 were used as a test set to externally validate the pharmacophore
models generated by Phase. The 1000-compound Schrödinger decoy
set was used for inactive compounds.

4.1.3 Screening Library Preparation
The
Specs screening collection (www.specs.net) consisting of >200 000 compounds was downloaded and prepared
as a conformational database for pharmacophore screening using Schrödinger
Phase software.18 The software generated
approximately 50 energy-minimized conformations of each compound,
with full enumeration of stereoisomers and tautomers ionized at a
target pH of 7.0 (±2.0). High-energy ionization and tautomer
states were removed, as well as compounds containing reactive functional
groups.

4.1.4 Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screen
The four-point pharmacophore model generated as described above was
used to screen the Specs collection conformational database. Hit compounds
were required to match all four points of the pharmacophore. Pharmacophore
tolerances were set to 2 Å for the database screen for each point.
No other special constraints or feature groupings were employed. Phase
Screen Score was used to score and rank the matching compounds. This
scoring function assesses both the quantity (if partial matching is
permitted) and quality of ligand feature matching, where quality is
defined by site, vector, and volume scoring components.19 Top-scoring compounds (top 10%) were clustered
by chemical diversity to identify high-scoring hits with novel chemical
scaffolds. Compound 3 was identified in this manner and
selected as a starting point for this study after visual inspection
of the pharmacophore match and alignment with the chalcone and pyrazoline
active compounds.

4.2 Chemistry
4.2.1 General
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
or Fisher Scientific. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
or analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Flash
column purifications were performed using a Biotage Isolera One system.
The proton and carbon NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance
III HD-400 spectrometer. All chemical shifts and coupling constants
are reported as δ (ppm) and J (Hz), respectively.
For 1H NMR, the solvent peaks were referenced as 7.27 ppm
(CDCl3) and 2.50 ppm (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6) and for 13C NMR as 77.23 ppm (CDCl3) and 39.51 ppm (DMSO-d6). High-resolution
mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded on Agilent 6530 accurate mass quadrupole
time-of-flight liquid chromatography (LC)/mass spectrometry (MS).
Low-resolution mass spectrometry data were obtained using Agilent
6120 single quad MS via direct injection. HPLC analyses were done
using a Shimadzu LC-20A analytical HPLC system with a Phenomenex Gemini
C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, 110 Å). Mobile phases
were A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O) and B (acetonitrile).
Gradient conditions were as follows: 0–2.0 min (100% A), 2.0–7.0
min (linear gradient: 0–100% B), 7.0–8.0 min (100% B).
Flow rate was 1 mL/min.

4.2.2 Syntheses of OMOM Protected
Derivatives 4a–d
Compounds 4a–d were synthesized using our previously
reported procedure.9

4.2.3 General Claisen–Schmidt Procedure: Syntheses of 6a–x
A solution of a substituted
acetophenone 4 (1.1 mmol) and benzaldehyde 5 (0.9 mmol) in MeOH (2 mL) was cooled at 0 °C, followed by the
dropwise addition of 60% aqueous NaOH solution (1 mL). The reaction
was stirred at room temperature for 8–24 h. After adding cold
water and subsequent neutralization with acetic acid, the pure product
was obtained by filtration and/or flash column chromatography on silica
gel.

4.2.4 General MOM Deprotection Procedure
In the case of MOM protected analogues, the crude product was subjected
to a solution of HCl/THF/i-PrOH (1:5:5) (20 mL) at
room temperature overnight. The solution was poured onto water (10
mL), followed by the extraction with EtOAc. The organic phase was
dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified using flash column chromatography
(hexane/EtOAc).

4.2.9 X-ray Crystal Structure of 12a
Crystals
of 12a were obtained from ethanol. A parallelepiped of
approximate dimensions 0.32 × 0.15 × 0.12 mm3 was mounted on a glass fiber. X-ray data were collected at 298 K
using a Nonius Kappa charge-coupled device diffractometer to a maximum
2θ value of 65.1° with monochromatized Mo Kα radiation;
38 906 total reflections were collected. The data were integrated
and scaled using the HKL suite of XdisplayF, Denzo, and Scalepack.
Unit cell parameters were retrieved and refined on 6392 reflections
(1.0° < θ < 32.6°). Crystal data for 12a: C21H17Cl2NO2, M = 386.28, monoclinic space group P21/c, a = 16.4194(7) Å, b = 10.6606(5) Å, c = 11.1508(4) Å,
β = 107.030(3)°, V = 1866.26(14) Å3, Z = 4, ρ = 1.375 g/cm3, μ = 0.362 mm–1. The structure was solved
by direct methods (SHELXD97). All non-H atoms were refined anisotropically and H atoms
were refined isotropically in the final full-matrix least-squares
refinement cycle on F, which converged at R = 0.0447,
wR = 0.0484, and GOF = 1.142 for 1965 reflections
with I > 3σ(I); a robust-resistant
weighting scheme was used in the least-squares refinements of the
303 variables. The final Fourier difference map was featureless; the
max./min. peaks were 0.20/–0.20 e–/Å3 and were located at chemically implausible positions. All
crystallographic calculations were performed using the Crystal Structure
Analysis Package (4.2.2), Rigaku Oxford Diffraction. Crystallographic
data for the structure of 12a have been deposited with
the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). Copies of the data
can be obtained, free of charge, on application to the Director, CCDC,

4.3 Biology
4.3.1 MIC Determination
Antibacterial MICs of test compounds
were determined using the standard microbroth dilution method as we
previously reported,29 which is according
to the protocols of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.28,29

4.3.2 Mammalian Cytotoxicity Assay
Cytotoxicity
of test compounds was evaluated using mammalian Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81).
Briefly, monolayers of cells cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were trypsinized,
seeded at approx. 10% confluence in 96-well plates, and incubated
overnight. The medium was replaced with DMEM/FBS containing twofold
serial dilutions of compounds. Detection was done using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay with overnight solubilization according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

4.3.3 MBC Determination
Bactericidal activities of the compounds were determined in 96-well
plates against S. aureus MN8 and Newman
using previously described methods.30 Essentially,
105 CFU/mL of bacteria was exposed to various concentrations
of compounds between 200 and 0.2 μg/mL for 24 h at 37 °C
in 96-well microtiter plates. Viable counting was performed by plating
onto Mueller–Hinton II agars, containing 10% charcoal, two
10 μL aliquots from each well where bacterial growth was inhibited;
charcoal plates were used to remove residual compounds. The MBC was
determined as the lowest compound concentration killing 3 Logs
of bacteria within 24 h when compared to the viable numbers of bacteria
at time zero.

4.3.4 MBEC Determination
MBECs were similar to previous methods,31 save for using Nunc 96-well plates as opposed to Nunc 96 TSP lids
to form biofilms. Biofilms were established in tissue-culture-treated
96-well microtiter plates. S. aureus strains (MN8, Newman, NRS70, and UAMS-1) were grown to OD = 0.2
in tryptic soy broth with 1% glucose, aliquoted (100 μL) into
96-well plates, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The liquid was
aspirated to remove planktonic cultures, and the plates were washed
three times with phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonadherent cells.
The remaining biofilm cells, formed on the wells of plates, were treated
with compounds (200–0.2 μg/mL) in Mueller–Hinton
II broth for 20 h. The plates were then washed to remove antibiotic,
fresh broth was added, and the plates were incubated overnight to
allow bacterial growth. The MBEC was then recorded as the lowest concentration
of compound that prevented bacterial regrowth as an indication of
biofilm eradication.

4.3.5 Membrane Potential Measurement
These experiments were performed using two biological replicates
per test concentration for flow cytometry to ascertain changes in
the membrane potential based on fluorescence probe DiBAC4(3). Methods were performed similar to those previously reported24 with the following changes: S.
aureus Newman was grown in Mueller–Hinton II
broth to exponential phase (OD600nm ≈ 0.2) and labeled
with DiBAC4(3) for 10 min before adding test compounds
at 1×, 4×, 16× their MICs. Following incubation for
30 min at room temperature, cells were analyzed in a BD LSR II flow
cytometer, with excitation at 488 nm. Green fluorescence emission
was measured using FITC filters; for each sample, 10 000 events
were collected. The membrane potential effects of test compounds were
analyzed using software FlowJo 10.4. Positive control was reutericyclin-867,
and negative control was vancomycin.
