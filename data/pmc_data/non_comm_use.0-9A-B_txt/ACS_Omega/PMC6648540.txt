In situ forming hydrogel shows enormous
potential as a therapeutic
implant or carrier in tissue repair and regeneration. It can perfectly
seal or fill the defective tissue, consequently functioning as a cell/drug
delivery vehicle. In this contribution, a new gelatin hydrogel with
dual-enzymatic cross-linking of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and galactose
oxidase (GalOx) was developed, and the therapeutic effect of this
hydrogel encapsulated with bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) in dermal
wound healing was investigated. This hydrogel possesses a quick gelation
process within 5 min, a high water content, and a uniform three-dimensional
(3D) porous network. The 3D cell culture study indicated that gelatin
hydrogel matrix of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U) or HRP(2U):GalOx(1U) could provide
a friendly 3D microenvironment for supporting the survival, proliferation,
and spread of mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) with negligible
cytotoxicity. Hematoxylin and eosin staining test suggested that this
hydrogel has superior histocompatibility and minimized immune response
in vivo. Furthermore, wound-healing studies on a C57 mouse model of
excised wound demonstrated that BMSC-laden gelatin hydrogel could
significantly accelerate the wound closure as compared to other groups.
These data suggest that this dual-enzymatically cross-linked gelatin
hydrogel loaded with BMSC has a great potential in wound healing and
other tissue-regeneration applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As
the largest and the most exposed and vulnerable tissue of human
body, skin tissue, once damaged, undergoes a repair process that appears
to be very complex.1 Although most skin
wound can be quickly and effectively healed within 1 or 2 weeks,2,3 the extensive full-thickness wounds are often hard to repair, which
causes serious impact on the health and even threaten people’s
life. The repair of wound is one of the most complex biological processes
involving activation of numerous intracellular and intercellular pathways
able to restore tissue integrity and homeostasis.4 Many studies have successfully used stem cells–seeded
hydrogels to promote the wound-healing process.5−8 Stem cells have the potential
of continuous proliferation and multidirectional differentiation.9 Hydrogels are three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked
polymeric networks and have been used extensively as scaffold or cell/drug
vehicle in tissue repair and regeneration.10−13 They have the appropriate structural
properties, including high moisture, elasticity, porous structure,
and good permeability to oxygen and metabolites, which make them suitable
to mimic the natural extracellular matrix. Especially, in situ forming
hydrogels exhibit many advantages, such as minimally invasive implantation,
simple encapsulation of cells and/or biomolecules, and so on.14−16 Through injection- or spray-based approaches, in situ forming hydrogels
enable the accurate filling of any irregular tissue defects. As the
artificial scaffold or delivery vehicle for application in tissue
repair and regeneration, these hydrogels should possess superior biocompatibility.

Recently, enzymatic cross-linking strategies have received considerable
attention for the development of in situ forming hydrogels due to
their quick gelation rate, high specificity, and mild reaction condition
for cell and tissue.17 Specifically, gelation
of phenol-rich polymer mediated by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) has
been studied for wide range of applications, such as drug delivery,
tissue repairing, and tissue engineering.18,19 For this cross-linking system, HRP catalyzes the cross-linking of
phenol-rich polymer by consuming hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidizing agent, and the most frequently used way
of supplying H2O2 is the direct addition of
H2O2 aqueous solution from an external environment.
However, this kind of hydrogel has a limitation associated with compromising
cytocompatibility and formation of heterogeneous hydrogel due to initially
high localization H2O2 concentration.20,21 Recently, Sakai et al. proposed a method of HRP-mediated gelation
through “indirect” addition of H2O2 generated by glucose oxidase (GOx) and d-glucose.22 This hydrogelation could be triggered by glucose-containing
body fluids such as human blood23 and serum,24 which means that the use of the gel for in vivo
applications may have a potential problem. As glucose is a common
molecule in our bodies, superfluous GOx in the gel will further oxidize
glucose molecules and generate undesired H2O2 in vivo. Therefore, development of other methods for gelation using
a combination of various oxidases and HRP should lead to much more
biocompatible processes suitable for widespread applications.

Unlike glucose, galactose is rarely found in mammals and can be
oxidized by galactose oxidase (GalOx) to produce H2O2 and galactohexanose. Herein, we utilize GalOx as a H2O2-generating enzyme to indirectly supply H2O2 in HRP-mediated cross-linking reaction and successfully
fabricate an injectable gelatin hydrogel with negligible cytotoxicity
in vitro and immune response in vivo. In addition, this gelatin hydrogel
loaded with bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) significantly promoted
the wound-closure process. Hence, this dual-enzymatically cross-linked
gelatin hydrogel encapsulated with BMSC might have a great potential
in dermal wound healing.

2 Results and Discussion
Gelatin, a hydrolysis product of collagen, has shown remarkable
advantages for tissue engineering applications, including excellent
biocompatibility, matrix metalloproteinase mediated degradability,
and retaining natural cell adhesion motifs (e.g., Arg–Gly–Asp
(RGD)).25,26 In addition, the digestion process confers
gelatin low antigenicity and minimal inflammatory response in vivo.
As a result, it has been broadly used in the pharmaceutical and biomedical
area. However, the in vivo application of gelatin has been limited
thus far due to its low upper critical solution temperature and quick
enzymatic degradation.27 Many attempts
were made to overcome these challenges, including a HRP-mediated cross-linkable
gelatin hydrogel developed by conjugating enzymatically cross-linkable
hydroxyphenyl propionic acid.28 However,
this method needs H2O2, which creates an adverse
microenvironment to the cells. Sakai et al. developed a new way by
an indirect addition of H2O2 generated by GOx
and d-glucose, which highly improved the cytocompatibility
of gelatin hydrogel.22 Since glucose is
a common molecule in our body, further oxidation of glucose molecules
leads to the generation of undesired H2O2 in
the body if GOx remains in the gel.21 Therefore,
in this study, we developed a novel approach to supply H2O2 generated by GalOx, and the scheme is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 (A) Synthetic scheme
of gelatin–hydroxyphenyl conjugate
and the 1H NMR spectra of the GH conjugate. (B) Synthetic
scheme of BMSC-loaded GH hydrogel dual-enzymatically cross-linked
by HRP and GalOx.

According to the 1H NMR and UV–vis spectra (data
not shown) of GH and unmodified gelatin in Figure 1A, the successful conjugation of hydroxyphenyl
to gelatin is confirmed,28 and the degree
of substitution of hydrophenyl groups is 31.38 μM/g gelatin.
Physical characteristics of GH hydrogels including injectability,
gelation time, water content, external and internal micromorphology,
and mechanical property were detected and analyzed. Result in Figure 2A suggest that this
hydrogel can be injected and molded for in situ cross-linking for
minimally invasive in vivo applications. The gelation time and water
content of the GH hydrogels enzymatically cross-linked by different
units of GalOx and HRP were also investigated and are shown in Figure 2B,C. With the increase
of enzymatic concentration, the gelation process was accelerated.
However, there is no significant difference among their gelation times.
The water content of all samples exceeds 80% but displays a nonpositive
relation between enzymatic content. High water content property might
contribute to reducing the frictional irritation to the surrounding
tissue.29,30

Figure 2 Physical characterization of GH hydrogels including
injectability
(A), gelation time (B), water content (C), external and internal micromorphology
(D, E), and mechanical property (F). GH (8% wt), d-galactose
(50 mM), HRP (1, 2, and 5 U/mL), and GalOx (0.5, 1, and 2 U/mL). GH
hydrogels of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U), HRP(2U):GalOx(1U), and HRP(1U):GalOx(1U)
is 5:1, 2:1, and 1:1, respectively in (F).

In addition, the external and internal structures of the
GH hydrogels
were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2D,E). It can be seen that hydrogels
have a uniform porous network, and the internal pore sizes of the
GH hydrogel range from hundreds to dozens of microns. The relatively
large pore sizes of these hydrogels might make a great contribution
to the permeation of nutrients, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide,
discharge of metabolites, and so on, which will be beneficial to cell
growth and proliferation encapsulated within the hydrogel.30

The mechanical properties of the hydrogel
were evaluated by measuring
Young’s modulus using small-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments.
A strain sweep test (0–10%) was performed at an oscillatory
frequency of 10 rad/s for each hydrogel, and the results shows that
a strain of 1% is in the linear viscoelastic range for all of the
tested hydrogels. Then, the linear viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogels
was characterized by oscillatory frequency sweep measurements, and
the data of storage modulus (G′) and loss
modulus (G″) are shown in Figure 2F. Hydrogel formation was further
confirmed because the storage modulus (G′)
was greater than the loss modulus (G″). And
the increase in G′ values ranged from 100
to 200 Pa at an angular frequency of 10 rad/s with the increase in
HRP content. However, all G′ values of hydrogels
show no significant difference.

As a cellular scaffold, hydrogel
should possess superior biocompatibility.
The cytocompatibility was first evaluated by a 3D culture in vitro
for 1, 3, and 7 days. Interestingly, the BMSC encapsulated within
the hydrogels of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U) and HRP(2U):GalOx(1U) displays
a significantly higher survival, proliferation, and stretch ratio
compared with the BMSC encapsulated within the HRP(1U):GalOx(1U) hydrogel
(Figure 3). More importantly,
the BMSC within the hydrogels of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U) and HRP(2U):GalOx(1U)
stretched extremely well. This phenomenon might be attributed to the
slower consumption ratio of H2O2 under less
HRP content condition. Long exposure time to H2O2 may lead to more cellular harm, which affects cellular proliferation
and stretching. Hence, we chose the GH hydrogel of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U)
as the scaffold to encapsulate BMSC for further research in vivo.
In addition, the magnified views of BMSC culturing within the hydrogels
for 1, 3, and 7 days are shown in Figures S1–S3.

the hydrogels of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U), HRP(2U):GalOx(1U), and HRP(1U):GalOx(1U)

Moreover, the biocompatibility of the GH hydrogel
in vivo was also
assessed by subcutaneous experiment of the C57 mice . Hematoxylin
and eosin (HE) staining was performed to investigate the immune response
for the transplanted hydrogel, and the results are displayed in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 4B, the hydrogel clearly
presents almost no inflammatory cells, which verify the low immunogenicity
of the GH hydrogel enzymatically cross-linked by HRP and GalOx.

after 4 days. (B) HE staining of the muscular tissue around the GH
hydrogel.

In recent years, studies have
found that cell-laden or cytokine-encapsulated
hydrogels could promote the wound-healing process. Therefore, in this
study, we investigate the promoting capacity of BMSC-laden GH hydrogels
on the dermal wound-healing process. As shown in Figure 5, BMSC-laden GH hydrogels group
induced significant reduction of wound extension compared with the
control group and BMSC group after 6 days of treatment. As we know,
the ability of pure BMSC to repair is mainly determined by the paracrine
effect. However, purely cell therapy is limited by the low survival
rate and insufficient number of transplanted cells.31,32 The GH hydrogel could dramatically enhance the cellular survival
and proliferation under 3D culture condition, thus possibly improving
the survival rate and the number of transplanted cells. Therefore,
the enhanced dermal wound-healing ability of the BMSC-laden GH hydrogels
can be reasonably ascribed to the improved microenvironment supplied
by the GH hydrogel for transplanted BMSC.

3 Conclusions
A new
GH hydrogel in situ enzymatically cross-linked by HRP and
GalOx was developed and characterized. This hydrogel of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U)
and HRP(2U):GalOx(1U) exhibits many superior physical and biological
properties including injectability, quick gelation process within
5 min, and excellent cytocompatibility and histocompatibility. Significantly,
BMSC-laden hydrogel composite of HRP(5U):GalOx(1U) could obviously
promote the dermal wound-healing process. Therefore, it is anticipated
that this BMSC-carrying hydrogel composite has a great application
potential in dermal tissue repair and regeneration.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Gelatin
(type A from porcine
skin, less than 300 bloom), HRP (type VI, salt-free, 250–330
units/mg solid), 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl) propionic acid (HPA), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
(EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), GalOx, and d-galactose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Dimethylformamide (DMF) was obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The chemical reagents were used as obtained
without purification. The dialysis membrane (molecular cutoff = 3500
Da) was purchased from Spectrum Laboratories (Rancho Dominguez, CA).
Mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) were obtained from the Cell
Bank, Type Culture Collection, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai,
China.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Gelatin–Hydroxyphenyl
Synthesis of gelatin–hydroxyphenyl (GH) has been described
everywhere.28,33,34 Briefly, HPA was first activated with EDC and NHS in a co-solvent
of water and DMF (volume ratio of 3:2) for 30 min. The activated HPA
solution was then added to the preheated gelatin solution and stirred
at 40 °C for 24 h. The resulting solution was transferred into
a dialysis bag, dialyzed against deionized water at 45 °C for
3 days, filtered, and lyophilized to obtain the GH conjugates. GH
was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (AS400, OXFORD
instruments, U.K.), and the phenolic contents of the conjugates were
measured quantitatively at 275 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(V-750 UV/vis/NIR, Jasco, Japan).

4.3 Fabrication
and Characterization of GH Hydrogel
Eight weight percent
GH was dissolved in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) media containing 50 mM d-galactose, followed
by adding different amounts of HRP (1, 2, and 5 U/mL) and GalOx (0.5,
1, and 2 U/mL). The injectability of this GH hydrogel was also verified
by a syringe. The gelation time of the GH hydrogels was calculated
by the inverted tube test.

The water content of the GH hydrogels
was calculated with the following formula: D (%)
= [(W0 – W1)/W0] × 100, where D denotes the water content of the hydrogels, W0 denotes the wet weights of the hydrogels, and W1 denotes the dried weights after freeze-drying.

The surface and internal morphologies of the GH hydrogel was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Quanta200, Netherland) after
lyophilizing, breakage, and gold spraying.

The rheological behavior
of the GH hydrogels was evaluated by detecting
their modulus of elasticity using a rheometer platform (Leica DHR2,
Germany). The dynamic oscillation scanning frequency ranged from 1
to 100 Hz, and the temperature and strain were set as 37 °C and
1%, respectively.

4.4 Three-Dimensional Culture
of BMSC within GH
Hydrogel
BMSC were suspended in the 8% GH solution containing
HRP (1, 2, and 5 U/mL) and d-galactose (50 mM) at a concentration
of 1 × 10 6 cells/mL. Then, GalOx (1 U/mL) was added
to the GH/HRP/d-galactose/BMSC solution to induce gelation
at 37 °C for 10 min. The BMSC-loaded GH hydrogels were cultured
using fresh DMEM/F12 complete medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum)
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5%
CO2.

After culturing for 1, 3 and 7 days, the BMSC-loaded
hydrogels were stained with cell Live/Dead kit (Calcein-AM/PI) at
37 °C for 10 min and then observed using fluorescence microscopy
(Leica DFC7000T, Germany). The viability of the BMSC was determined
by counting and calculating from at least three fields of view for
each sample.

4.5 Biocompatibility of GH
Hydrogel in Vivo
To evaluate the biocompatibility of the
GH hydrogel, 8% GH/HRP/GalOx/d-galactose mixed solution was
injected subcutaneously in the
C57 mouse. After 4 days, the surrounding tissues were sectioned and
HE staining was used to evaluate the biocompatibility of the GH hydrogel
in vivo.

4.6 In Vivo Wound-Healing Study
To monitor
the process of wound closure, a full-thickness excision wound model
was used. Male C57 mice weighing 22–26 g were used. All manipulations
were carried out under aseptic condition. First, all of the animals
were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10% wt, 0.35 mL/100 g body
weight) by intraperitoneal administration. Then, the dorsal region
of the mice was chosen to avoid animals’ access to their own
wound, and the dorsal hair was shaved. Whereafter, the shaved area
was disinfected with Betadine R 10%, and a full-thickness wound with
a diameter of 1.5 cm was excised from the back of the mice using sterile
scissors. The mice’s respiration and heartbeat were monitored,
and they were kept warm until they were completely awake and the vital
signs were stable. The mice were housed one per box to prevent cross-access
to the lesions. The C57 mice (n = 6) were divided
into three groups and subcutaneously injected with normal saline (100
μL), BMSC (100 μL, 106 cells), and BMSC-laden
GH solution (100 μL, 106 cells) around the wounds,
respectively. The wound size of the mice on day0, day6, day8, day10,
day13, and day16 was measured using ImageJ software. The rate of wound
closure representing the percentage of wound reduction from the original
wound size was calculated using the following formula: [wound area
day0 – wound area (day6 or day8, day10, day13, day16)]/wound
area day0 × 100. Values are expressed as percentage of the healed
wounds ±SD.
