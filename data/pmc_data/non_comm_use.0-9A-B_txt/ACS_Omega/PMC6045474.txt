Owing
to the dwindling arsenal of antibiotics, new methodologies
for their effective and localized delivery are necessary. The use
of optical control over delivery of drugs, also known as photopharmacology,
has emerged as an important option for the spatiotemporally controlled
generation of drugs and bioactive molecules. In the field of antimicrobial
photopharmacology, most strategies utilize ultraviolet light for triggering
release of the antibiotic. The use of such short wavelength light
may have limitations such as phototoxicity. Here, a small molecule
that is activated by visible light to release a fluoroquinolone, a
broad-spectrum antibiotic, is reported. A boron-dipyrromethene, which
is sensitive to cleavage at 470 nm, was used, and levofloxacin was
used as a model fluoroquinolone. BDP-Levo was found to undergo cleavage
in the presence of visible light to release the active antibiotic.
Using growth inhibitory studies in Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative
bacteria, the efficacy of BDP-Levo is demonstrated. Together, our
study demonstrates that visible light can be used for optical control
over antibiotic release and lays the foundation for visible-light-mediated
antimicrobial photopharmacology.

Introduction
The modern antibiotic
era has exacerbated the morbidity and mortality
associated with bacterial infections. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics
have, in part, contributed to the emergence of drug resistance.1 Antimicrobial drug resistance, compounded with
a limited pipeline of new antibiotics, has now become a major global
public health threat.2,3 The number of antibiotics that
continue to remain effective is dwindling at an alarming rate, and
the existing classes of antibiotics need to be better used to increase
longevity.4 Because antibiotics are used
systemically, a large buildup of the bioactive molecule is invariably
unavoidable. This affects not only the pathogen of interest but also
gut microbiota that are crucial for our health and well-being. Furthermore,
environmental exposure to antibiotics leads to the possible buildup
of drug-resistant pathogens. For certain types of infection, if spatiotemporal
control over antibiotic generation can be achieved, side effects can
be reduced and perhaps patient compliance can be improved. The past
several decades have seen the emergence of photopharmacology, which
aims to minimize the problem of off-target activity and decrease deleterious
side effects by offering an external control over the action of the
drug.5,6 In the field of antimicrobial photopharmacology,
an antibiotic is attached to an optical switch or a photocleavable
group;7 upon irradiation, the active form
of the antibiotic is produced (Figure 1a). For example, Feringa and co-workers have reported
a diazo functional group linked to a model fluoroquinolone (Figure 1b).7−9 This functional group serves as an optical switch. Upon exposure
to UV light, isomerization occurs, which results in the active antibiotic
being formed. It is proposed that after the antibiotic action is completed,
another source of light could be used to inactivate the antibiotic.
Fuchter and co-workers have developed a methodology for aminohydrolase-based
antibiotics.10 Using a 2-nitroaryl cleavable
group, Forsythe and co-workers have reported a hydrogel that is triggered
by UV light (Figure 1c).11 Although this liberates ciprofloxacin,
the use of UV light is not highly desirable and may have problems
associated with phototoxicity. The use of visible light, on the contrary,
has considerably lower toxicity and is therefore highly desirable.
Here, we report a methodology that is suitable for visible-light-triggered
release of a fluoroquinolone.

antibiotic. (b)
Example of an optically controlled antibiotic: UV light is used to
convert an inactive trans isomer to the active cis isomer. (c) UV-triggered
release of ciprofloxacin, a clinically used antibiotic. The sphere
represents a tether for cross-linking.

Among the various fluorophores that have been previously
used as
triggerable scaffolds to deliver bioactive molecules,12 boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-based fluorophores have distinct
advantages. They are stable in buffer, have high quantum yields, are
relatively nontoxic, and their wavelengths of absorption can be tuned
by systematic structural modifications.13 Recently, Urano and co-workers have reported the cleavage of a B–O
bond in aryloxy-BODIPY derivatives.14,15 In addition,
there are two other reports of a polymeric scaffold for drug delivery16 as well as a small molecule for delivery of
the pharmacologically active gaseous species, hydrogen sulfide.17 We thus designed BDP-Levo, 1, to
deliver a fluoroquinolone using visible light as a trigger (Figure 2). This compound
is expected to undergo cleavage by visible light to produce a self-immolative
phenolate that rearranges to generate the active antibiotic (Scheme S1, Supporting Information (SI)).

BODIPY-based scaffold for visible-light-triggered release
of a fluoroquinolone antibiotic.

Results and Discussion
First, the BODIPY derivative, 3, was synthesized using
a reported procedure, and this compound was reacted with levofloxacin
(Levo) to produce the desired BDP-Levo, 1, with good
yield (Scheme 1).18 Because the release of carboxylic acids has
hitherto not been studied using this BODIPY protective group, benzoate
ester 5 was synthesized (Scheme 1). The photophysical properties of these
BODIPY derivatives were studied. Fluorescence measurements (excitation
470 nm, emission 509 nm) were conducted (see Figure S1, Supporting Information), and quantum yields were determined
using standard protocols. Consistent with previous reports, the esters
were weakly fluorescent and diminished quantum yields were recorded
(see Table S1, Supporting Information).
Next, using the irradiation conditions that were previously reported, 1 was incubated in methanol and exposed to 470 nm light.14 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis of the reaction mixture showed complete decomposition of 1 to produce the methoxy derivative, BDP-OMe (4, Scheme S1; see SI). In the absence of
light, we found no evidence for the decomposition of 1 (Figure 3a). Quantum
yield measurements of the irradiated samples showed a significant
increase compared to those of the unirradiated samples (see Table S1, SI). Because the product in each case
is the BDP-OMe, the quantum yields were identical (see Table S1, SI).

Figure 3 (a) Portions of HPLC traces of 1 incubated in methanol:
Ctrl, t = 0; dark, t = 30 min; light,
reaction mixture was irradiated for 30 min with 470 nm light (30 mW/cm2), decomposition of 1 produces the methoxy derivative,
BDP-OMe (4, Scheme S1; see
SI). Here, the detector wavelength is 500 nm. (b) Irradiation for
30 min with 470 nm light was followed by incubation of 1 in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. A fluorescence detector was used with
excitation 330 nm and emission 510 nm. Yield was estimated as 31%
using authentic Levo.

Scheme 1 Syntheses of 1 and 5 from 3
The BDP-Levo derivative, 1, was next incubated in
pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and was found to be stable for 30 min. After
irradiation, the reaction mixture was diluted in pH 7.4 buffer, and
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis showed nearly complete decomposition
of 1 when exposed to light and the formation of levofloxacin 2. The experiment in dark, as expected, did not generate 2, suggesting the stability of 1 in pH 7.4 buffer
(Figure S2; see SI). Next, the formation
of Levo was assessed by HPLC analysis of 1 in pH 7.4
buffer that was irradiated for 30 min. A distinct peak that corresponded
to the formation of 2 was observed (Figure 3b). The yield of 2 under these conditions was estimated as 31%. This yield is similar
to the yield of histamine that was generated by a previous report
of a BODIPY-histamine scaffold.14,17

To study the
bactericidal effects of the BODIPY scaffold, bacteria
were exposed to the BODIPY derivative 3 (Figure S6; see SI). No significant inhibition
of growth was observed in dark as well as in light, suggesting that
the scaffold does not contribute to the growth inhibitory effects.
Under similar conditions, levofloxacin 2 was a potent
inhibitor of growth of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in dark as well as in light,
suggesting that the efficacy of levofloxacin was not dependent on
irradiation (Figure 4b). A similar result was obtained when this experiment was conducted
using the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (Figure 5). Together, these data support the use of 1 to effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria only when
exposed to visible light.

as in light. *p-Value < 0.001 for comparison of
bacteria treated with 1 in dark versus irradiated with
470 nm light.

The OD600 of compound 1 under irradiation
conditions was negligible during the assay, suggesting no interference
in the broth dilution assay by the compound (see SI). In addition, an agar-growth method was used to evaluate
the efficacy of 1 (Figure 6). Here, bacteria after exposure to 1 (either
light or dark) were grown on an agar plate. Images of these plates
were recorded periodically (Figure S8;
see SI).

Figure 6 Growth inhibition of E. coli on
agar plates: E. coli grown on an agar
medium for 6 h after exposure to 1. Dark indicates agar
plates with 1 (100 μM) were not exposed to light;
light indicates agar plates with 1 (100 μM) were
exposed to light for 30 min at 470 nm.

After 6 h, a clear inhibition of growth of bacteria was recorded
with respect to the control (Figure 6). This data was consistent during 24 h incubation
as well. No significant inhibition of growth of bacteria incubated
with 1 in dark was observed. Similarly, the negative
control, 3, showed no inhibition of bacterial growth.
In the presence of light, the inhibitory potency of 1 was comparable with the clinically used antibiotic, 2 (Figure S8; see SI).

Taken together,
we report for the first time a small-molecule-based
methodology for visible-light-triggered release of levofloxacin, a
clinically used antibiotic in its pharmacologically active form. This
third-generation antibiotic has superior antibacterial properties
compared with those of ciprofloxacin that has been previously used.19,20 Feringa and co-workers have proposed that inactivation of the antibiotic
after use is important, and this is not possible in the present methodology
and may be a shortcoming that will need to be addressed.21 A number of dendrimer-/polymer-based scaffolds
for phototriggered release of an antibiotic are known.22,23 A cell-wall-targeted dendrimer nanoconjugate containing ciprofloxacin
was recently reported. Using this method, phototriggered release of
ciprofloxacin was achieved. Our approach can be adapted to incorporate
such targeting ligands in future. Recently, hollow microspheres that
can rapidly produce localized heat activated by near-infrared light
and control the release of an antibiotic via a “molecular switch”
in their polymer shells have been reported.22,23 This photothermally responsive drug delivery system has distinct
advantages and presents an attractive methodology for combination
therapy.23 Because the scaffold reported
herein is triggered at 470 nm, further modification is necessary to
enhance the wavelength of cleavage as well as for incorporation into
polymeric scaffolds. These studies are presently under way in our
laboratory.

Although there is an urgent need to develop antibiotics
with novel
targets and new mechanisms of action,24−28 adjuvants that can enhance the activity of antibiotics,29−31 preserving the existing classes of antibiotics, is a major public
health priority. Improving patient compliance and monitoring inappropriate
use are among the long-term solutions. Directed delivery of antibiotics
to the site of infection,32 perhaps, will
result in minimizing the systemic exposure to the antibiotic6 and may minimize certain unwanted side effects
of fluoroquinolones.33,34 Although this strategy is in
its infancy, our small molecule lays the foundation for visible-light-activated
antibiotic delivery. Lastly, the mechanism of antibiotic action is
being investigated and the role of redox mechanisms in lethality is
under scrutiny.35 Development of new tools,
such as the compound reported herein that can facilitate a better
understanding of antibiotic mechanisms, will be useful. These experiments
are presently under way in our lab, and results will be reported in
due course.

Bacterial Strains
and Growth Conditions
Both the strains E.
coli (ATCC 25922) and S. aureus (ATCC 29213) were obtained from ATCC. All of the bacterial strains
were routinely grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth, Mueller Hinton broth
II (MHB) cation supplemented medium, tryptic soy agar and tryptic
soy broth, purchased from Himedia. For every experiment, a starting
culture was produced by inoculating a single colony picked from the
agar plate into liquid medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C
with continuous shaking. Levofloxacin was purchased from TCI in the
purified powdered form.

E. coli ATCC 25922 was grown overnight in Luria Bertani (LB) broth. Bacterial
density was adjusted to 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL
corresponding to an optical density (600 nm, OD600) of
0.1. Next, 200 μL of this bacterial suspension was taken in
a 96-well microtiter plate. Different lanes were chosen for different
conditions such as bacterial control, bacteria with compound 1, bacteria with compound 3 (negative control),
bacteria with levofloxacin, and so on. Then, 100× stock solutions
were used for all of the compounds. One plate without irradiation
was incubated at 37 °C in the dark by covering with an aluminum
foil. Another plate was irradiated at 470 nm (30 mW/cm2) by blue light-emitting diode (LED) at room temperature in a closed
chamber for 5 min and then incubated at 37 °C in the dark by
covering with an aluminum foil. OD600 was measured using
a Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash microwell plate reader for both
the plates at an interval of 1 h for 6 h. Values reported are average
of six replicates. Errors have been calculated from standard deviation
between the values.

Methicillin-sensitive S.
aureus ATCC
29213 was grown overnight in Mueller Hinton broth II (MHB) cation
supplemented medium. A similar procedure was followed further as was
followed for E. coli.

Growth Inhibition
of E. coli on
Agar Plates
Agar plates were prepared using soyabean casein
digest medium (tryptone soya broth) and agar powder. E. coli ATCC 25922 was grown overnight in Luria Bertani
(LB) broth. Bacterial density was adjusted to 108 colony-forming
unit (CFU)/mL corresponding to an optical density (600 nm, OD600) of 0.1. Next, 100 μL of this bacterial suspension
was taken for streaking on the agar plate. Then, 100× stock solutions
were used for all of the compounds. Bacteria were streaked on the
entire surface of the agar plate using a Hi-Flexiloop 4 (Himedia).
For samples with irradiation, bacterial suspensions (with or without
compound) were taken in a quartz cuvette and irradiated at 470 nm
(30 mW/cm2) by blue LED at room temperature in a closed
chamber for 30 min. These irradiated samples were then streaked on
the agar plates. All of the plates were then incubated at 37 °C
in the dark by covering with an aluminum foil. Images were taken from
0 to 24 h using Nikon D3300 DSLR.
