Investigations
dealing with N-heterocyclic carbenes and their derivatives
are usually centered on the influence that they exert by acting as
catalysts, ionic liquids, or metallodrugs and consequently on their
capabilities to tune the properties and reactivity of these systems.
In this context, we aimed to focus on the internal molecular changes
undergone by imidazole derivatives, from electronic and geometrical
points of view. This work represents an empirical evidence of the
molecular modifications that an imidazole skeleton undergoes upon
protonation, alkylation, and metalation.

Introduction
N-Heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs) have emerged along the last quarter
century as versatile tools with numerous applications that have made
a considerable impact in chemistry, physics, and material science.1−6 There is a wide variety of symmetric and asymmetric NHC ligands
bearing protons, alkyl, or aryl substituents at the nitrogen atoms.
Among other uses, NHCs are excellent ligands capable of stabilizing
alkali, alkaline earth, transition, and inner transition metal complexes.7 Their strong electron donor ability modifies
the electronic properties of the metals, including metallophilicity.8,9 This enhancement of electron density is systematically exploited
in homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis10,11 and in the design of potential antitumor metallodrugs.12 NHCs also exhibit an interesting main-group
reaction chemistry that involves, for example, the stabilization of
E–E multiple bonds, activation of E–E bonds, ring expansion reactions, and so
forth.13 In addition, NHCs can be deposited
on surfaces as anchoring or mobility units;14 they have also been applied directly as organocatalysts, facilitating
the synthesis of sophisticated organic synthons, molecules, and metal-free
polymers.15,16

Given this background, it is evident
that the importance of imidazoles
and their cationic imidazolium derivatives results to a large extent
from the fact that these heterocyclic rings are reactants in the synthesis
of NHCs. However, imidazoles and imidazolium salts are important in
their own right. Thus, imidazole rings are part of many natural products,
and this building block is present in significant biological bases
and in drugs of physiological activity. Likewise, imidazolium derivatives
form ionic liquids with a variety of substituents and anions, which
are commonly considered as green solvents and utilized for a wide
range of applications.17

It is clear
that the many chemical facets of imidazole and imidazolium
salts make them important and ubiquitous compounds. It is, therefore,
quite surprising that there is a lack of studies dealing with the
structural and spectroscopic characteristics of imidazole/imidazolium
systems, in a systematic manner, emphasizing, for example, the changes
that the aromatic N-heterocyclic ring may undergo upon protonation
or alkylation to form the imidazolium precursors. These kinds of comparative
studies are usually biased because imidazole/imidazolium systems are
often regarded as mere intermediates in the pathway toward the synthesis
of NHCs.

In this work, we have focused on exploring this last
topic, as
detailed studies of this kind are scarce. Herein, we, therefore, report
a thorough study of the structural, spectroscopic, and electronic
properties of a stepwise synthesized imidazole and of two imidazolium
derivatives (Scheme 1). In particular, our synthetic approach includes: (i) a neutral
imidazole derivative, 1-(2-phenoxyethyl)imidazole (1a, PhOEtIm); (ii) its protonated R,H-NHC form, 1-(2-phenoxyethyl)imidazolium
tetrafluoroborate (1b, [HPhOEtIm]BF4); (iii)
the corresponding bisNHC salt, methylenebis(N-2-phenoxyethyl)imidazolium
diiodide (2, [H2bisPhOEtIm]I2);
and (iv) the palladium complex, [Pd(bisPhOEtIm)I2] (3), which incorporates a methylenebis(N-2-phenoxyethyl)imidazol-2-ylidene
unit (bisPhOEtIm) as the chelating ligand.

Results and Discussion
PhOEtIm
(1a) and [HPhOEtIm]BF4 (1b)
Synthesis of 1-(2-phenoxyethyl)imidazole (PhOEtIm)
(1a) was carried out starting from imidazole, which was
deprotonated in refluxing acetonitrile with excess NaOH. After treatment
with 2-phenoxyethylbromide, followed by separation and washing routines,
PhOEtIm was obtained as a white precipitate and recrystallized. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1a (r.t., (CD3)2CO) shows the H2 proton signal as a singlet (7.63 ppm) and
the H5 and H4 protons as pseudotriplets centered at 7.28 and 7.19
ppm, respectively. The phenyl ring protons are observed as multiplets
(centered at 7.28 and 6.94 ppm), and the 1H signals assigned
to the N—CH2 and CH2—O resonances appear as multiplets at 4.44
and 4.29 ppm, respectively. A complete NMR characterization (1H NMR, 13C{1H}-APT NMR, 1H—13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation
(HSQC)/heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC)) is provided
in the Supporting Information.

A
view of compound 1a is given in Figure 1, showing the imidazole ring N-connected
to the 2-phenoxyethyl unit. Table 1 lists bond lengths and angles, determined by X-ray
crystallography, for compound 1a, together with compounds 1b and 2, and the density functional theory (DFT)-calculated
data for the optimized structures, Ia, Ib, and II. It should be noted that the hydrogen atoms
in 1a were observed in the difference Fourier map. Both
imidazole and phenyl rings form a dihedral angle of 56.82(9)°,
whereas the N3—C6—C7—O8 torsion angle was found
to be 63.8(3)°. In the crystal, there are no strong intermolecular
interactions. The C2(H)···N1′ distance at 3.364(4)
Å is the shortest intramolecular contact within the crystal lattice;
but this appears to be too long to be regarded as even a weak hydrogen
bonding interaction between two neighboring 1a molecules.

Protonation of PhOEtIm
was achieved by stepwise addition of HNO3 to an aqueous
solution of 1a. 1H
NMR monitoring experiments in deuterated water revealed a pD-dependent
shift of the proton signals upon the stepwise protonation (Supporting Information). The pKa value of the N1 site in the PhOEtIm/HPhOEtIm+ equilibrium was found to be 6.56 ± 0.03 (value converted to
H2O).18 For comparison, we also
measured the acid dissociation constant of the related compound, 1-methylimidazole,
obtaining a pKa value of 7.18 ± 0.02
in H2O. This value is similar to previously reported approximations.19 Thus, as expected, the substituents have an
evident influence on the acidity constant of imidazoles, which is
a reflection of their electronic distribution and geometry.

After addition of LiBF4 to a solution of 1a, acidified with HNO3, colorless crystals of [HPhOEtIm]BF4 (1b) were isolated. We recorded 1H NMR spectra of 1a and 1b from crystalline
samples in (CD3)2CO (Figure 2). There is a large downfield shift in the
proton resonances upon protonation of the N-heterocyclic ring, 1a, demonstrating an important electronic change in the molecule.
The most affected protons are H2 (Δδ = 1.55 ppm), H5 (Δδ
= 0.62 ppm), and H4 (Δδ = 0.56 ppm), although aliphatic
(Δδ = 0.43 ppm, N—CH2 and 0.22 ppm, CH2—O) and, to
a lesser extent, phenyl protons (Δδ = 0.01–0.03
ppm) are also altered (Supporting Information).

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra in (CD3)2CO for
compounds 1a, 1b, and 2.

The crystal structure analysis
of HPhOEtIm+ (cation 1b) revealed notable
structural modifications when compared
to that of 1a (Table 1). A view of cation 1b is depicted in Figure 3. An interesting
aspect concerns the symmetrization undergone by the imidazolium ring
upon protonation, involving its bond distances and angles. These structural
changes can be rationalized invoking the resonant forms of an imidazole
ring versus an imidazolium ring (Scheme 2). Both C2—N bond distances are almost
identical in 1b: the C2—N3 distance becomes significantly
shorter (from 1.356(3) Å in 1a to 1.328(2) Å
in 1b), whereas the N1(H)—C2 length is 1.326(3)
Å in 1b (1.316(3) Å in 1a). These
structural attributes reflect the electronic changes that the imidazole
ring suffers upon protonation at the N1 atom. The proton changes the
aromatic character of the N-heterocyclic ring. Thus, the structural
and NMR spectroscopic variation of the neutral versus alkylated or
protonated systems may be rationalized as a change in the aromaticity
of the ring, with the protonated and alkylated cationic species being
more aromatic than the neutral imidazole precursors (vide infra).

Scheme 2 Protonation of an Imidazole Derivative:
Resonant Changes in the Ring
In addition, it is worth mentioning here that, although
the C4—C5
connection is usually depicted by a double line (Scheme 2, right), this bond is slightly
elongated with respect to the C=C bond distances typically
found in alkenes (ca. 1.34 Å). On the basis of the discussion
above, this elongation is the result of the aromatic character of
the N-heterocyclic pentagonal rings in imidazoles, imidazolium, and
carbenes. Likewise, N1—C2 and C2—N3 bond distances (typically
represented by a combination of solid and dashed lines) are between
the typical values found for C—N single (1.47 Å) and C=N
double (1.27 Å) bonds,20 being closer
from the single-bond value, reflecting again the effects of the electronic
delocalization in the pentagonal rings. On the basis of the structural
characteristics of the imidazole and imidazolium rings and their aromatic
character (see below), a circle within the ring appears to be appropriate
to illustrate the bonding within these N-heterocyclic rings. It is
not surprising, therefore, that some authors prefer this latter representation
for imidazole, imidazolium, and carbene molecules.

As commented
above, endocyclic ring angles are also influenced
by protonation. The presence of a proton at N1 widens by +4.6(2)°
the corresponding C2—N1—C5 angle: 1a, 104.6(2)°; 1b, 109.15(18)°. This structural change could be rationalized
from the point of view of the valence shell electron pair repulsion
(VSEPR) theory that assigns a higher repulsion power to lone electron
pairs than to sigma bonds; therefore, the protonation at the N1 atom
reduces the steric repulsion, leading to the observed increase in
the C2—N1—C5 angle. This structural phenomenon has been
typically observed in imidazole and pyrimidine rings of nucleobases
and actually serves as diagnostic for the presence of protonation
in these systems.21,22 In contrast, both adjacent N1—C2—N3
and N1—C5—C4 angles decrease, displaying differences
of −4.4(2)° (1a: 112.3(2)°; 1b: 107.93(17)°) and −3.6(2)° (1a: 110.6(2)°; 1b: 106.99(18)°), respectively.

Cation 1b exhibits an amphiphilic nature: a polar
central imidazolium core connected to the nonpolar hydrophobic phenyl
ring. Figure 3 outlines
contacts involving the imidazolium cation of 1b that
is surrounded by three BF4– anions. The
acidic proton at the N1 site forms hydrogen bonds with two symmetry-related
counter BF4– anions, namely, N1(H)···F11
(2.994(2) Å) and N1(H)···F11′ (2.903(2)
Å). Additional intermolecular C—F distances are C4(H)···F14
(3.207(2) Å), C5(H)···F12 (3.171(2) Å), and
C2(H)···F14 (3.169(2) Å). These latter contacts
are too long to be regarded as C—H···F hydrogen
bonds, although they could provide some weak lattice stabilization.
It should be noted that the crystal structure of 1b does
not exhibit substantial intermolecular interactions between neighboring
cations.

[H2bisPhOEtIm]I2 (2)
The bisimidazolium salt, [H2bisPhOEtIm]I2 (2), was prepared from the reaction between CH2I2 and 1a. Upon recrystallization in acetonitrile,
colorless crystals were isolated and studied. A complete NMR characterization
of salt 2 (1H NMR, 13C{1H}-APT NMR, 1H—13C HSQC/HMBC) is provided
in the Supporting Information. The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 [r.t., (CD3)2CO] conforms to the two-fold symmetry of the bisimidazolium
dication. Figure 2 illustrates
that the imidazolium protons in 2 suffer a significant
downfield shift with respect to the resonances of 1b:
H2 (10.51 ppm), H5 (8.56 ppm), and H4 (7.96 ppm). These data suggest
that the μ-CH2 bridge (singlet at δH 7.46 ppm) in 2 exerts a higher deshielding effect on
the protons of the imidazolium ring than on the proton in compound 1b. Alternatively, the observed proton chemical shifts could
be ascribed to different secondary interactions between the cation
and the anion as revealed in the crystal structures of both salts.
It is noteworthy that no significant 1H chemical shift
variation between 1b and 2 is observed for
the aliphatic and phenyl protons, indicating that, in this region,
the effect of protonation at N1 seems to be similar to the bridging
methylenation.

Iodide salt 2 of the H2bisPhOEtIm2+ cation crystallizes in the centrosymmetric C2/c space group (Figure 4), with the bridging
methylene group lying at the inversion center (C21 in Figure 4). Selected crystallographically
determined distances and angles are listed in Table 1 together, for comparison, with those calculated
by DFT. The imidazolium dication in salt 2 is transoid disposed, with a dihedral angle between both imidazolium
rings that approaches 90° (86.91(6)°). The N1—C21—N1′
angle between them is 107.8(2)°, close to the expected tetrahedral
angle supported by the bridging carbon atom. In addition, the aromatic
tails of the phenoxyethyl substituents display a dihedral angle of
52.29(9)° with the imidazolium rings. The N3—C6—C7—O8
torsion angle is 68.8(2)°. These angle values resemble those
found in the crystal structures of 1a and 1b.

Figure 4 View of the H2bisPhOEtIm2+ dication in iodide
salt 2.

The geometry variations found in the imidazolium rings of
compound 2 follow the same trend discussed above for
salt 1b. Thus, the N1—C2 bond distance is longer
(1.348(2) Å)
in 2 than in 1a and 1b and
(by chance) identical to that of C4—C5. Similarly, both N3—C4
and C5—N1 bond lengths in 2 are identical (Table 1). Besides, the C2—N3
bond distance does not vary with respect to that in both salts 1b and 2 and is shorter than the neighboring
N1—C2 bond distance. Regarding the ring angles, no significant
variations are observed between 1b and 2. Such changes are reflected in the aromaticity of the imidazole
ring (see DFT Calculations section).

As in the case of 1b, dication 2 displays
an amphiphilic nature. The crystal packing of 2 is dominated
by anion/cation interactions. Interestingly, these interactions involve
mainly the imidazolium rings and the μ-CH2 bridge,
demonstrating that, as expected, the positive charge is localized
around the imidazolium head of the molecule. Figure 5 shows the C(H)···I interactions
involving the cationic imidazolium rings. Although these interactions
are relatively long (C5, 3.777(2) Å; C2, 3.783(2) Å; C4,
3.813(2) Å; C21, 3.870(1) Å; C6, 3.903(2) Å), and the
protons involved are not very acidic, they seem to exhibit sufficient
hydrogen-bond-donor capabilities to interact with the I1 anions in
the crystal lattice. In any case, these short contacts are driven
by packing and electrostatic effects (Supporting Information). In this regard, the large proton chemical shifts
observed for H2 and H5 could be perhaps rationalized as the result
of the secondary cation/anion interactions in solution.

[Pd(bisPhOEtIm)I2] (3)
The
synthesis of 3 was carried out by the addition of 2 to a solution of palladium acetate in acetone. Immediately,
the solution changed color from orange to dark brown-orange, and after
24 h stirring at room temperature, the solution turned progressively
deep orange. The product was isolated by precipitation with ether,
followed by filtration. Recrystallization from acetone/ether afforded
compound 3 in 80% yield. Suitable crystals for X-ray
crystallography were grown by slow diffusion of ether into a dichloromethane
solution of complex 3 at room temperature.

The 1H NMR spectrum of 3 in deuterated acetone (r.t., Supporting Information) shows variations when
compared to that of 1a, 1b, and 2. Metal coordination at the C2 site, with the subsequent substitution
of the C2(H) proton, yields a high field shift of the proton signals,
in particular, of those placed in the immediate vicinity of the PdII ion. Thus, the H5 (7.60 ppm) and H4 (7.38 ppm) protons appear
in the spectra of 3 as doublets, displaying a Δδ
compared to those of imidazolium salt 2 of −0.96
and −0.59 ppm, respectively. Phenyl proton multiplets show
minor variations and are centered at 7.23 (meta), 6.90 (para), and
6.84 (ortho) ppm, respectively. The CH2 bridging unit exhibits
an AB system,8 centered at 6.45 ppm (Δδ
= −1.01 ppm, in comparison with 2), whereas the N—CH2 and CH2—O are shown in the 4.2–5.2 ppm range. Regarding the 13C{1H} NMR spectra, metalation of the C2 sites
produces an expected substantial shift of this resonance, from the
range of 137.5–138.8 ppm (C2 sites in 1a–c) to 169.1 ppm (C2 site in 3). A complete NMR
characterization is available in the Supporting Information.

The crystal structure of compound 3 shows a rather
distorted square-planar coordination of the palladium ion, which incorporates
a chelating bisPhOEtIm unit and two iodido ligands (Figure 6). Salient intramolecular distances
and angles are presented in Table 2. The angles C12—Pd1—I2 and C22—Pd1—I1
are 174.46(9) and 164.62(9)°, respectively. The latter exhibits
a clear distortion from linearity that is found in less than 11% of
PdL4 (L = any atom) square-planar complexes.a

An interesting question concerns the structural modification
undergone
by the bisPhOEtIm ligand upon C2 cis-coordination to the palladium
ion, which formally represents a substitution of the C2(H) protons
by a PdII center. First, both imidazole rings change into
a mutual cisoid orientation and display a tilt angle of 72.5(1)°,
in contrast to the transoid orientation and almost right dihedral
angle exhibited in cation 2. This rotation does not affect
the geometry of the bridging sp3 hybridized CH2 unit, with angle and distances involving both pentanuclear rings
in compound 3 of 107.3(3)° (N11—C31—N21),
1.457(4) Å (N11—C31), and 1.461(4) Å (N21—C31),
respectively. Corresponding values in 2 were 107.8(2)°
(N1—C21—N1′) and 1.455(2) Å (N1—C21).
In reference to the imidazole geometry, it should be noted that the
higher standard deviations exhibited by crystal 3, probably
due to the presence of both iodido ligands, hinder a thorough comparison
of records. However, some tendencies can be analyzed. Substantial
variations include the following: (i) the C2—N3 distances in 3 (C12—N13, 1.346(4) Å; C22—N23, 1.342(4)
Å) are longer than those in 2 (1.327(2) Å),
namely, they possess a lower double-bond character as a result of
the electron density donation to the metal center. (ii) Interestingly,
the N1—C2—N3 angles are significantly smaller in 3 (N11—C12—N13, 105.4(3)°; N21—C22—N23,
105.0(3)°), when compared to those in 1a (112.3(2)°), 1b (107.93(17)°), or 2 (107.27(17)°).
The decrease of this angle has usually been observed in NHC compounds
with transition metals at the C2 site (Supporting Information). It should be recalled here that a (unprotonated)
carbene has a mean N1—C2—N3 value of 101°,b even smaller than that observed in 3. (iii) A side consequence of this is that in 3 the
C2—N1—C5 angles (C12—N11—C15, 111.4(3)°;
C22—N21—C25, 111.3(3)°) are even wider than those
in 1b (109.13(16)°).

Following the dictates
of the VSEPR, as commented above, the reduction
of the N1—C2—N3 angle upon deprotonation of the imidazolium
salts can be rationalized as a consequence of the higher repulsion
power of the electron lone pair at the ylidenic carbon atom versus
the C2—H bond. Likewise, upon coordination of the carbene ligands
to a metal center, the lone electron pair loses its inherent repulsion
capabilities and the angle increases but not as much as that when
the carbon is protonated, indicating that the steric effects of the
metal center play, as expected, a role in the structural changes of
the ligand.

DFT Calculations: Aromaticity
We
carried out DFT optimizations
(M11L, 311++G(d,p), SMD water) to study the calculated geometries
of compounds 1a, 1b, 2, and 3. The resulting optimized intramolecular bond lengths and
angles of the corresponding compounds (namely, Ia, Ib, II, and III) are listed in Table 1. The salient coordinates
are summarized in the Supporting Information. Overall, calculated arrangements anticipate those obtained experimentally
and follow the described trends for the crystal structures: bond angles
fit well, although some of the bond length values display minor differences.
Thus, the arguments and trends exposed for the crystal structures
are also valid here.

An interesting feature concerns a calculated
tautomer of 1a, namely Ia*, in which the
proton at the C2 position in Ia has been shifted to the
N1 site in Ia*, allowing for the study of the C2-carbene
atom. As expected, in terms of relative energy, the Ia* tautomer is less stable than Ia (ΔE = 25.7 kcal mol–1). The geometry of Ia* shows a higher degree of symmetry in the imidazole tautomer ring,
when compared to that of Ia (N1—C2, 1.347 Å;
C2—N3, 1.350 Å; N3—C4, 1.368 Å; C4—C5,
1.347 Å; C5—N1, 1.361 Å). Furthermore, the N1—C2—N3
angle shows a value of 101.4°, which is in agreement with previously
reported examples.a

As described in this
work, protonation or alkylation at the N1
atom of the neutral imidazole ring leads to an increase in the aromatic
character of the resulting cationic system. The higher degree of aromaticity
is clearly reflected by the observed equilibration in the crystallographic
bond distances of the N-heterocyclic rings, and it may be related
to the large downfield chemical shift found in the 1H NMR
spectra upon protonation and alkylation.

The aromaticity of
the optimized models has been estimated by the
nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS). The NICS(0) value was calculated
at the geometrical center of the aromatic ring, whereas NICS(1) are
the values obtained at a perpendicular distance of 1.0 Å above
the ring center. In our case, due to the low symmetry of the models,
the value of NICS(1) depends on which side of the ring is considered,
and therefore NICS(0) values have been considered. Most negative NICS
values represent a higher aromaticity degree. Table 3 lists salient NICS(0) values for Ia, Ia*, Ib, II, and III. We have calculated the aromaticity at both rings, namely, imidazole
and phenoxy. The NICS(0) value for the imidazole ring of Ia is −12.5, whereas this value for the Ia* tautomer
is −12.9 (Table 3). The protonated form, Ib, exhibits a lower NICS(0)
value, that is, −14.3, which corresponds, as expected from
the experimental data, to a higher level of aromaticity. Alkylation
of the imidazole ring in II results in an NICS(0) value
of −13.8, which is between the neutral forms, Ia/Ia*, and the protonated cation, Ib. Complex III, which incorporates a chelating PdII ion at
the C2 sites, displays the lowest aromaticity of the series (NICS(0),
−10.4). Thus, symmetrization observed upon protonation and
alkylation in the crystal structures results in a higher degree of
aromaticity at the imidazole rings. For comparison, the H,H-imidazolium cation and the methyl derivative,
[Ia—CH3]+, were optimized,
giving NICS(0) values of −15.9 and −13.7. Thus, protonation
has a higher effect than alkylation on the aromaticity of the imidazole
derivatives, whereas the C-substituents at the endocyclic N atoms
do not substantially affect the aromaticity of the imidazolium rings.
In contrast, variations in the aromaticity of phenoxy rings are not
remarkable.

Conclusions
In
summary, we carried out a stepwise synthesis of an imidazole
derivative (1a), its protonated imidazolium salt (1b), the related bisimidazolium salt (2), and
a PdII-metal complex (3). A comparison between
the structure of 1a and its protonated form 1b entails a geometrical transformation that can be envisaged as a
symmetrization (aromatization) of the imidazole ring. These geometrical
variations and the corresponding electronic redistribution are observed
by NMR spectroscopy. This trend is further reinforced in the bisimidazolium
salt, 2. Substitution of the C2(H) protons of 2 by a metal center, or, namely, coordination of a PdI2 unit to form 3, results in slight modifications of
the geometry of the aromatic rings. The DFT-calculated bond distances
and angles in the optimized models are consistent with the X-ray crystallographic
data, and NICS criteria reveal that the imidazolium cations exhibit
a higher aromaticity than the unprotonated forms and the metal complexes,
and, in particular, protonation confers a higher aromaticity level
than alkylation.

PhOEtIm (1a)
Compound 1a was synthesized

Instrumentation
1H NMR and 13C{1H}-APT NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker ARX 300
MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are given as dimensionless δ
values. The spectra were referenced to the corresponding residual
solvent peaks or to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propanesulfonate (TSP),
used as an internal reference for D2O measurements. Coupling
constants, J, are given in hertz. Identification
of signals was achieved by 1H—13C HSQC/HMBC
experiments (Supporting Information). The
pD values of the NMR samples were measured by a glass electrode and
adjusted by the addition of NaOD or DNO3.

Determination
of pKa Values
Acidity constants
were determined by pH-dependent 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Chemical shift variations were registered at different
pD values. These were obtained by adding 0.4 units to the pH meter
reading (uncorrected pH*). pD was evaluated versus the chemical shift
values by a nonlinear least-squares fit according to the Newton–Gauss
method.18 The obtained pKa values (for D2O) were converted to values
valid for H2O.25

X-ray Crystallography
Crystal data and refinement parameters
for 1a, 1b, 2, and 3 were collected on an APEX-II diffractometer with graphite monochromated
Mo Kα radiation (0.71073 Å). Data reduction and cell refinements
were carried out with the APEX2 software package.26 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined
by full-matrix least-squares on the basis of F2 using the SHELXL-97 and WinGX software.27,28 All nonhydrogen atoms were located from difference Fourier maps
and were refined anisotropically. Protons were either observed in
the difference Fourier map (1a, 1b) or positioned
geometrically (2, 3), and they were refined
with isotropic displacement parameters following a riding model. Calculations
were performed using the SHELXL-97 and WinGX programs.

Quantum Chemical Calculations
DFT
calculations were
performed to calculate the energy minima of the systems and the resulting
molecular geometries, providing, therefore, good models for comparison
with the crystallographically determined data. The M11L29 functional was utilized, through the polarizable
continuum method (SMD).30 The basis sets
used for C, N, O, and H were 6-311++G(d,p). Pd and I were represented
with the use of the relativistic effective core potential from the
Stuttgart group.31,32 All calculations were performed
with the Gaussian09 software.33 NICS34 values were computed using the Gauge-including
atomic orbital method at the same level of theory,35,36 either at the geometrical center of the rings (NICS(0)) or above
the perpendicular plane of the rings (at 1.0 Å, NICS(1)). Coordinates
are given in the Supporting Information.
