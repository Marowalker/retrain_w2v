In
the quest for developing novel narrow band gap semiconductor
materials, the research in metal chalcogenides has gained a strong
attraction. In the present investigation, a surfactant-free hydrothermal
route has been followed to design hierarchical self-assembled flower-like
ZnIn2S4 structures through control over precursor
concentration and hydrothermal processing parameters. Uniform hexagonal
marigold flower-like ZnIn2S4 architectures (∼4
μm) were formed with self-assembly of petals (thickness ∼8–12
nm) forming rose-like structures and finally forming marigold flowers
in 24 h duration. The hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower
structure has been used as photocatalysts for the degradation of dye
and chlorinated phenols. Photodegradation demonstrates that the high
surface area from the porous flower architecture (∼72 m2/g) with an enhanced visible light absorption giving low band
gap energy (2.15 eV) is responsible for higher photocatalytic performance.
Complete degradation of the organic pollutants has been observed within
90 min in the presence of natural sunlight. To understand the participating
reactive species contributing to degradation, scavenger studies were
performed for deducing the plausible photocatalytic degradation pathways.
This study might open new insights into the design of novel hierarchical
structures.

1 Introduction
Synthetic textile dyes
constitute a large class of contaminated
wastewater.1,2 Azo- and fluorine-based dyes constitute
a significant portion.3,4 The degradation products of these
dyes include aromatic amines that are highly carcinogenic. One of
the widely used “green” technologies is heterogeneous
photocatalytic oxidation processes for the decomposition of organic
dyes soluble in wastewater.5,6 Recently, attention
has been paid to designing of new nontitania and nonoxides as effective
materials that can harvest and show enhanced activity under visible
light irradiation than under ultraviolet light.7−10 Through these materials, the
natural sunlight could be utilized more efficiently for the photocatalytic
process. In a pursuit to develop such materials, self-assembled three-dimensional
(3D) structures through one-dimensional and two-dimensional nanoscale
building blocks have been used to form 3D hierarchical architectures.11,12 Such hierarchical structures often lead to large surface area and
open pore structures providing more active sites for favorable transport
of electrons and holes to the surface for reaction to occur. Subsequently,
this may lead to superior properties in comparison to the nanoscale
materials.13,14

The ternary chalcogenide
semiconducting compounds have acquired
interest due to their tunable optical and electrical properties.10,15 Among them, ZnIn2S4 has demonstrated potential
applications in diverse fields such as thermoelectricity,16 charge storage,17 electrochemical recording, and as photocatalysis.18−20 To achieve
the optimum potentiality of the material, synthesis of ZnIn2S4 by various chemical methods plays a major role. The
control of shape and size of these inorganic structures is of utmost
importance because of the strong correlation between the synthesis
parameters and physical/chemical properties.21,22 Various researchers have reported the solution/soft chemistry route
to be the best technique for synthesizing variant chalcogenide compounds
with desired properties.23,24

Literature reports
several different morphologies of ZnIn2S4 prepared
via effective methods.25 Shen et al. employed
nanostructured ZnIn2S4 for hydrogen evolution,
and the photocatalytic activity of
ZnIn2S4 was greatly affected by the crystal
plane spacing along the c axis.11 One-dimensional ZnIn2S4 nanotubes
and nanoribbons were synthesized by a solvothermal technique using
pyridine as a solvent, and hollow microspheres were synthesized by
the hydrothermal method using cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide or poly(ethylene
glycol) surfactants.26 In another study,
porous polycarbonate membrane was used as a hard template to fabricate
nanotubes and nanowires of ZnIn2S4, with the
wall of the tubes 5 nm thick. ZnIn2S4 nanotubes
imparted the highest visible light photoactivity for the degradation
of methyl orange (MO) in 4 h.27 Chen et
al. studied the effect of ZnIn2S4 polymorphs
for the degradation of rhodamine B and methyl orange, where the negative
(0001) S plane enhanced the adsorption of cationic dyes over hexagonal
ZnIn2S4 compared with methyl orange and affects
the photocatalytic activity synergistically.28 Similar studies indicated rhodamine B is degraded by 97%, and only
5% methyl orange is degraded under the same conditions.29 Most of the studies reveal the poor photocatalytic
activity of ZnIn2S4 for the degradation of dyes.

Apart from the dye pollutants, chlorinated phenols are also contemporary
in the system that results in high toxicity and serious environmental
issues.30,31 On the basis of the above context, development
of a hierarchical material with well-defined structures and morphologies
without surfactants and with enhanced surface activity to degrade
these pollutants would be of great research interest. In the present
study, we have reported the design and optimization of hierarchical
ZnIn2S4 flower structures without any additional
reagents. The concentration of precursor contents, hydrothermal temperature,
and time have been varied to obtain a stable hierarchical structure.
The optimized hierarchical ZnIn2S4 structure
has been studied for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange.
The degradation studies of chlorinated phenols were also carried out
to understand the diversified effect of ZnIn2S4 structures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Processing Parameters on Crystal
Structure
To investigate the purity of the crystal phase
as an effect of different processing parameters such as thiourea content,
hydrothermal temperature, and time, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
were carried out, and the results are represented in Figure 1a–c. Figure 1a presents the composite XRD
pattern of the hydrothermally synthesized powders obtained with various
stoichiometric contents of thiourea at a temperature of 180 °C
for 24 h. The powders synthesized with stoichiometric thiourea are
designated as ZIS-TU, whereas those with double the stoichiometric
amount are designated as ZIS-2TU. Similarly, those with 3 and 4 times
the stoichiometric thiourea are named as ZIS-3TU and ZIS-4TU, respectively.
The XRD pattern of ZIS-TU shows a series of characteristic peaks,
with a few peaks having low intensity. These peaks can be attributed
to the hexagonal phase of ZnIn2S4 (JCPDS No.
72-0773).32 However, it can be presumed
that phase formation is not complete and yet to occur. It is clear
from the figure that ZIS-TU has the lowest crystallinity in comparison
to the other samples. When the thiourea content was doubled, sharp
and high crystalline hexagonal peaks were prominent, with main characteristic
peaks indexed to (006), (105), (0010), (108), (1010), (112), (0012),
(203), and (1112) corresponding to the space group P63mc of hexagonal crystal structure. No other crystal
phase related to the impurity phases such as binary sulfides and oxides
are present, indicating the high phase purity of ZIS-2TU. With the
higher content of thiourea (i.e., ZIS-3TU and ZIS-4TU), some of the
crystal planes of hexagonal crystal phase are also observed to grow.
A significant increment in hexagonal crystal planes (004), (104),
(105), and (112) is observed to develop from ZIS-2TU to ZIS-3TU to
ZIS-4TU. There were no traces of impurity peaks apart from the extra
developed peaks that also correspond to the hexagonal crystal phase
of ZnIn2S4. It is known that ZnIn2S4 exhibits different polytypes depending on the difference
in stacking fashion of sulfur atoms in the matrix.33 The coordination environment of ions in the solution governs
the formation of either the hexagonal or cubic phase.34 In the precursor solution, thiourea can form three different
complexes with In3+ and Zn2+, namely tetrahedral
[In(TU)4]3+, [Zn(TU)4]2+, and octahedral [In(TU)6]3+. Under the hydrothermal
conditions, the complexes [In(TU)6]3+ and [In(TU)4]3+ formed initially undergo Ostwald ripening and
further react in situ with [Zn(TU)4]2+ to produce
a thermodynamically stable hexagonal ZnIn2S4 containing both octahedral and tetrahedral coordination of In3+ ions.35 Scherrer’s formula
was used to calculate the crystallite sizes of the synthesized powders.
The calculated crystallite sizes are ∼43, ∼66, ∼72,
and ∼72 nm for ZIS-TU, ZIS-2TU, ZIS-3TU, and ZIS-4TU, respectively.
There is not much difference between the crystallite sizes of ZIS-2TU
and ZIS-3TU, indicating that apart from the growth of few planes due
to high thiourea content, it does not significantly affect the crystallite
size. In this study, pure and stable hexagonal crystal phase of ZnIn2S4 was obtained at twice the stoichiometric amount
of thiourea (ZIS-2TU). Thus, experiments for further process optimization
were carried out keeping this amount thiourea content.

Figure 1 Composite XRD patterns
as an effect of (a) thiourea content (parameters:
temperature 180 °C and time 24 h); (b) hydrothermal temperature
(parameters: thiourea content 2TU and time 24 h); and (c) hydrothermal
duration (parameters: temperature 180 °C and thiourea content
2TU).

Figure 1b presents
the XRD pattern of hydrothermal experiments performed with double
the stoichiometric content of thiourea at different hydrothermal temperatures
(170, 180, and 190 °C) kept for 24 h duration. The obtained powders
were designated as ZIS-170, ZIS-180, and ZIS-190 for different temperatures.
It can be observed that at 170 °C, some of the hexagonal peaks
are still to be developed and become highly crystalline. Upon comparing
the XRD pattern obtained for 170 and 180 °C, the peaks for ZIS-180
are highly crystalline compared with ZIS-170. This has also been confirmed
from the calculation of crystallite sizes, which is ∼44 nm
for ZIS-170, which is similar to that for ZIS-TU obtained in our previous
XRD study. There is a sharp increase in the crystallite size from
∼66 to ∼110 nm (ZIS-190) when the temperature is raised
from 180 to 190 °C. The crystallite size almost doubles probably
due to Ostwald ripening of the particles at a high reaction temperature.36 Thus, the particles synthesized at 180 °C
is found suitable to form a highly crystalline stable and lower crystallite
size hexagonal ZnIn2S4.

To identify the
influence of hydrothermal duration on the crystal
phase formation, identical set of experiments were performed at different
time durations for 6, 12, 18, 24, and 28 h under the constant temperature
of 180 °C and twice the stoichiometric amount of thiourea content
in the precursor solution. The powders obtained were designated as
ZIS-6 h, ZIS-12 h, ZIS-18 h, ZIS-24 h, and ZIS-28 h, as shown in Figure 1c. There was no significant
change in the crystal phase of ZnIn2S4 synthesized
at 6 and 28 h. However, an increment in the crystallite size is observed
from ZIS-6 h (∼61 nm) to ZIS-28 h (∼74 nm). It was difficult
to conclude the optimum time due to similar hexagonal crystal phases,
thus microscopic imaging of these synthesized powders was carried
out for optimization on the basis of morphology formation.

2.2 Morphological Analysis
A better understanding
of the particle growth can be obtained from the microscopic imaging
of the synthesized powders at different time intervals; thus, the
powders were investigated by the field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM) technique. Figure 2a–f shows the images of the powders named ZIS-6
h, ZIS-12 h, ZIS-18 h, ZIS-24 h, and ZIS-28 h. A high agglomeration
among particles with nonuniform shapes was observed for powders of
ZIS-6 h (Figure 2a).
Apart from these nonuniform particles, the presence of also plate-shaped
particles indicates the development of some specific morphology. Upon
increasing the hydrothermal duration to 12 h (Figure 2b), self-assembly of petal-like structures
was observed to form rose-like structures along with other particles
that are nonuniformly distributed in the system. However, further
increasing the hydrothermal duration to 18 h results in hierarchically
spherical flower-like structures having an average flower size ∼3–5
μm (Figure 2c).
There are also some petals over the surface of the flowers that are
softly agglomerated and self-assembled to form flower-like structures.
A careful observation reveals that the powder synthesized at 24 h
duration has uniform spherical marigold flower-like structures that
are well formed from the organization of petal structures. The average
size of the flower is observed to be in the range of ∼4–7
μm (Figure 2d),
which is higher than the flower size for ZIS-18 h. An area of the
spherical marigold flower ZIS-24 h has been zoomed in to determine
the thickness of the petals forming these structures as shown in Figure 2e. The thickness
of the petals ranges from ∼8 to 12 nm. Further increasing the
hydrothermal duration to 28 h shows an increment in these flower sizes
varying from ∼7 to 10 μm (Figure 2f), which could be attributed to the growth
of the flowers via Ostwald ripening process.37 In both parts, Figure 2c,d, we observe an opening mouth, which is indicative of the hollow
flower structures based on the high-resolution images shown later.
The enhancement in the aspect ratio of the flower can be due to the
lower petal thickness and self-assembly. The hierarchical marigold
flower structure was observed to have open cavity size of ∼500
nm. It can be predicted that beyond 24 h, flowers merely grow to form
flowers of enlarged size. The specific Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of ZIS-6 h, ZIS-12 h, ZIS-18 h, ZIS-24 h, and
ZIS-28 h are 23, 24, 47, 72, and 62 m2/g, respectively.
It is quite evident that the surface area decreased after 24 h, which
reveals that an increment in the flower size decreases the cavity
distance between the petals, reducing the N2 adsorption
during the surface area measurement. A more detailed morphological
and structural analysis for ZIS-24 h has been carried out as a part
of optimized powder characterization.

at different hydrothermal
duration (a) ZIS-6 h; (b) ZIS-12 h; (c) ZIS-18 h; (d, e) ZIS-24 h;
and (f) ZIS-28 h.

Figure 3 shows the
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of powder synthesized at
24 h. Figure 3a,b shows
two distinct natures of the same flower morphology. Some of the spherical
flowers are opaque; however, some flowers are hollow, which was also
observed in FESEM images mentioned previously. The average flower
size has been observed to be ∼4 μm from Figure 3a. Formation of these hierarchical
structures in aqueous media without any surfactant under hydrothermal
conditions is possible by geometrical building blocks forming an array
of particles that get layer curvatures and develop into flower structures
as reported by Kale et al.25 On the other
hand, the development of hollow flower structures could be due to
the assembly of small flowers to form a bigger flower, leaving behind
a cavity in between the assembly. The edges of the flower are observed
to be transparent. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
taken from the flower edge shows a distinct array of spots demonstrating
the single crystalline nature of the ZnIn2S4 petals (Figure 3c).
The advantage of this unique type of hierarchical marigold flower
structures is that they impart a higher surface area due to open access
to the interspaces between the interweaved petals that boosts the
light-harvesting ability of the hierarchical structures through the
multireflection process on the incident visible light and provides
more active sites for the photocatalytic reaction.

2.3 Optical Properties
The optical properties
of the ZnIn2S4 powders synthesized under different
hydrothermal duration were investigated through UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra. The reflectance data were converted to the Kubelka–Munk
unit of absorption by means of Kubelka–Munk function,35,38 and a plot of F(R)2 versus photon energy is plotted (Figure 4a). The intersection of the extrapolated
linear portion to photon energy gives the estimation of band gap energy
values (Eg). The Eg values varied with respect to hydrothermal duration and range
from ∼1.77 to 2.49 eV. The Eg value
for ZIS-24 h is estimated to be 2.15 eV, which is similar to the reported
band gap values for ZnIn2S4 structures.21,39,40 Furthermore, the conduction and
valence band positions of the optimized ZnIn2S4 flowers were determined from the estimated band gap values using
the following equation41 1  where EVB and ECB are valence band and conduction band edge
potentials, Ee is the energy of free electrons
on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV), Eg is
the band gap energy, and X is the electronegativity
of the semiconductor. The estimated valence band edge potential is
1.65 eV, and the corresponding conduction band edge potential is estimated
to be −0.5 eV. On the basis of the calculated band positions,
the possible mechanism for visible light photocatalysis over ZnIn2S4 flower structures is shown in Figure 4b. It can be well observed
that the valence band of ZnIn2S4 is less positive
than that of E° (•OH/OH–) (1.65 V vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)), indicating
that the photogenerated holes are not able to oxidize OH– to give •OH.28 The
conduction band is more negative than E° (O2/O2–•) (−0.33 V
vs NHE), indicating that the photogenerated electrons can reduce the
surface chemisorbed O2 to yield the strong oxidizing species
O2–•. From the above observation,
it could be presumed that the photocatalytic reaction via ZnIn2S4 is favorable through photogenerated electron
converting the adsorbed oxygen molecules on the surface of the flower
to superoxide radical as an active species. To validate this hypothesis,
photocatalytic reaction in the presence of different scavengers were
performed, as discussed in the later section.

gap determination and (b) calculated band
positions of ZnIn2S4 and a possible mechanism
for visible light photocatalysis.

2.4 Compositional Analysis
A significant
investigation on the surface chemical states of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 flower using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurement is essential, as the trace content of any impurity
that cannot be detected in other analytical methods can have a synergistic
influence over the photocatalytic properties of the material. Figure 5 shows the wide survey
of ZnIn2S4 and the corresponding elements Zn-2p,
In-3d, and S-2p. The wide survey scan clearly shows the specific peaks
for the presence of elements C, O, Zn, In, and S (Figure 5a). The binding energy for
the C-1s peak at 284.6 eV was used as the reference for calibration,
as it is attributed to the adventitious carbon species on the samples.
The peaks in Zn, In, and S elements were deconvoluted to identify
any trace impurities. The binding energies centered at 1021.2 and
1044.4 eV of Zn-2p (Figure 5b) correspond to the Zn-2p3/2 and Zn-2p1/2, respectively, which governs Zn to be in the Zn2+ form
in ZnIn2S4.42,43 The binding
energies at 444.5 and 452.2 eV in XPS spectra of In-3d can be well
attributed to the In-3d5/2 and In-3d3/2, respectively
(Figure 5c), indicating
In3+ to be the existing form. The XPS spectra of S-2p were
deconvoluted into two separate peaks centered at 161.4 and 162.7 eV,
as shown in Figure 5d indexed to S-2p3/2 and S-2p1/2, respectively,
confirming the S2– form of sulfur.44 The XPS signals obtained are consistent with the available
literature values. The absence of any other elemental peaks and surface
states other than C and O from atmospheric absorption confirms the
chemical purity of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 flower
structures.

structures.

2.5 Photocatalytic
Studies
We optimized
the hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower structure synthesized
at 180 °C for 24 h with a double thiourea content (ZIS-24 h)
to be the photocatalyst that will be used for the investigation of
degradation of a model pollutant, methyl orange (MO). Apart from the
optimization of the photocatalyst through morphology, the photocatalytic
tests were also performed for individual ZnIn2S4 samples prepared under different reaction parameters prior to the
systematic photocatalysis using the optimized photocatalyst. A series
of degradation experiments were carried out under metal halide lamp
with each of the synthesized catalyst with catalyst loading of 50
mg/50 mL and the corresponding degradation results has been tabulated
in Table 1. The results
depict that each of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 particles
show variation in the specific surface area due to the hydrothermal
processing conditions governing the morphology formation, which indeed
have a significant effect on the photocatalytic degradation of MO.
Prior to each of the photocatalytic experiment, adsorption–desorption
equilibrium was achieved without light irradiation, and the absorbance
obtained after adsorption was considered as the initial concentration
for the photocatalytic experiments. The highest photoactivity of 96%
was achieved with ZIS-24 h, which also has a high specific surface
area among other synthesized photocatalysts, proving the superiority
of the ZIS-24 h powders. The results also provide insight into the
morphology-driven photoactivity following a trend: ZIS-6 h (nonuniform/plate
particles, 54%) > ZIS-12 h (rose-like structure, 67%) > ZIS-24
h (hierarchical
flower structure, 96%). The degradation with ZIS-18 h and ZIS-28 h
is lower, as the surface area of ZIS-18 h is low due to the presence
of some agglomerated plates on the surface of hierarchical flower
structure and the phenomenon of Ostwald ripening in ZIS-28 h reduces
the surface area because of prolonged hydrothermal duration. Thus,
based on the photocatalytic tests, the hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower synthesized at 180 °C for 24 h with double
thiourea has been optimized.

The
surface charge of the photocatalysts plays an important role
in the adsorption of dye pollutants. Although literature reports the
surface charge of ZnIn2S4 to be negative,29 confirmation of adsorption ability is much needed
before detailed photocatalytic analysis. Therefore, prior to the systematic
photocatalytic experiments, dye pollutant with contrary charges such
as methylene blue (MB, a cationic dye) and methyl orange (MO, an anionic
dye), which is the model pollutant in our case, was allowed to adsorb
onto the ZnIn2S4 surface under dark conditions
(50 mg catalyst/50 mL 20 ppm dye solution). We observed complete adsorption
of MB on the ZnIn2S4 surface within 60 min,
whereas only 22% MO adsorption takes place in 120 min, which remains
constant afterward. The above results point toward the negative charge
on the surface of flower-like ZnIn2S4 structures,
which allows adsorption of the MB molecules on the surface of the
catalyst. A similar result has been obtained by Chen et al.,28 where they have reported that the exposed negative
(0001) S plane of hexagonal ZnIn2S4 is responsible
for the adsorption of cationic dye.

The variation in C/Co of MO (where C is the concentration at time t and Co is the initial concentration
after adsorption equilibrium) as a function of time under different
catalyst loading conditions is shown in Figure 6a. Before the initiation of catalytic experiments,
the degradation of dye in the presence of visible light solely was
carried out to understand the degradation in the presence of light
and the observed photolytic degradation (PL) of MO was only 12%. Most
of the studies have shown negligible adsorption of MO; however, in
the present case, adsorption of methyl orange over ZnIn2S4 was observed to be 14, 22, and 25% with catalyst loading
of 25, 50, and 100 mg/50 mL 20 ppm MO, respectively, which increases
with increase in the catalyst loading. This increased adsorption could
be attributed to the open cavities in the flower structures of ZnIn2S4, which facilitate the adsorption of dye. However,
there is no significant increment in adsorption with the doubling
of catalyst loading from 50 mg (22%) to 100 mg (25%). After the adsorption
equilibrium, the visible light was switched on to carry out the photocatalytic
experiments. We observe that the degradation increased from 92 to
96% when the catalyst loading is doubled from 25 to 50 mg/50 mL for
20 ppm MO. However, further doubling the loading from 50 to 100 mg
decreases the catalytic activity to 88%. This decrease in catalytic
activity could be attributed to the increased agglomeration among
particles due to higher loading content, which reduced the active
sites due to agglomeration. Another reason is that absorption of light
by the particles reduces due to segregation of particles and thus
reduces the activity.45 The photocatalytic
activity is comparable for all of the loadings. Therefore, first-order
kinetic plot of −ln C/Co versus time was plotted to determine the kinetic rate
constants with respect to catalyst loading, which would give insight
into the choice of catalyst loading. Figure 6b presents the kinetic plot of photolysis
and also loading effect on the photochemical reaction. The reaction
follows the pseudo-first-order kinetics as shown in the figure. The
kinetic rate constants with respect to different catalyst loading
are 16.3, 26.4, and 17.2 (×10–3) min–1 for 25, 50, and 100 mg/50 mL of 20 ppm MO, respectively. The above
data suggest that the rate of the reaction is almost halved with an
increase in catalyst loading to 100 mg and also with a decrease in
catalyst loading to half. There is a 1.6-fold increase in the rate
constants of 25 and 50 mg catalyst loadings. On the basis of the above
findings, the highest photocatalytic degradation with the highest
rate constant is observed with a catalyst loading of 50 mg and has
been used for further photocatalytic experiments.

(b) kinetic profile (parameters constant:
MO concentration 20 ppm, and temperature 25 ± 2 °C); (c)
degradation profile with respect to oxidizer H2O2; and (d) first-order rate constant vs oxidizer concentration in
control system.

The presence of an oxidizer
in the photochemical system acts as
a booster for the production of reactive species and thus is an important
additive for improving the photocatalytic activity of any material. Figure 6c shows the effect
of the presence of the oxidizer H2O2 and its
comparative photocatalytic degradation under the influence of visible
light irradiation. The reactions carried out under different conditions
are designated as follows: (a) in the presence of oxidizer H2O2 only, without a catalyst; (ii) in the presence of catalyst
only, without H2O2, named as control; and (iii)
in the presence of both H2O2 and catalyst. The
concentration of hydrogen peroxide has been varied as 1 and 2.5 mM
in the photochemical control reactions. The dye degradation in the
presence of H2O2 under visible light irradiation
is via photolysis of the oxidizer H2O2, which
is through the hemolytic cleavage of H2O2 producing
HO• radicals that contribute to the photochemical
reaction as shown in eq 2.46 In addition, H2O2 is also capable of accepting the photogenerated electron from ZnIn2S4 that inhibits the electron–hole pair
recombination and also facilitates additional HO• radicals, as shown in eq 3 2   3  The degradation
observed in the presence of
H2O2 having concentrations of 1 and 2.5 mM is
48 and 65%, respectively. This phenomenon indicates that the hydroxyl
radical production for the degradation of MO in the presence of H2O2 is quite fast, and complete degradation of the
dye can be achieved within less time. Comparing the photocatalytic
degradation in the presence of H2O2 with control
and control itself, complete degradation is achieved within 90 min
in the presence of H2O2, where more than 90%
degradation happens in the first hour. This suggests that increment
in H2O2 concentration has a significant effect
on the degradation and its presence greatly influences the photochemical
system. Figure 6d presents
the first-order rate constants of the photochemical reactions, which
evidently indicate that the rate of the reaction increases significantly
in the presence of 1 and 2.5 mM H2O2, which
is 54.7 and 49.8 (×10–3) min–1, respectively. There is a 1.8 and 2.0 times increase in the rate
constant in comparison to the control. The rate constant of control
is higher than that of the reaction carried out with the oxidizer
solely. It is well observed that complete photochemical degradation
of MO also takes place in the presence of 1 mM H2O2. Because the photolytic degradation of MO in the presence
of 1 mM H2O2 solely is also high, we presumed
the degradation to happen much faster within less time. The above
results suggest that there might be an ongoing competition between
the oxidizer-produced hydroxyl radicals and other produced photoreactive
species in the photochemical system for degradation of MO. To understand
the reactive species active in degradation of MO, experiments were
carried out in the presence of different reactive species scavengers
without the presence of oxidizers.

As already predicted from
the valence band and conduction band
potential calculations
in Section 2.3, the
photocatalytic reaction via ZnIn2S4 is favorable
through photogenerated electron converting the adsorbed oxygen molecules
on the surface of the ZnIn2S4 to superoxide
radical as an active species. Figure 7a shows the variation in C/Co of MO as a function of irradiation time before
and after the scavengers were added to the photochemical system. The
prime role of these active species was determined through the variation
in C/Co of the dyes after
the scavengers were introduced in the system. Only 57% of MO was degraded
upon introducing benzoquinone (BZQN) to the photochemical system,
and there was an obvious inhibition of the photochemical degradation.
There was no significant suppression of the catalytic degradation
with the addition of other scavengers such as tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH, OH• scavenger),
glycerol (GLY, h+ scavenger), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO,
e– scavenger). It can be observed that with the
addition of GLY, the concentration of MO decreased quickly in the
first 60 min and then became slow. The results indicate that quite
a large number of O2–• were generated
when the catalyst was irradiated with visible light, and this played
an important role in the degradation of the dye. The dye degradation
was slightly suppressed when DMSO was added to the system in comparison
to t-BuOH. Under the visible light irradiation of
ZnIn2S4 in the system, electrons in the valence
band transfer to the conduction band and form electron–hole
pairs. The photoexcited electrons also have the possibility of the
recombination either at the surface or directly that may result in
reduced efficiency. However, the recombination was obviously restrained
when glycerol was added into the system to scavenge the holes. So,
during this time, more electrons get migrated to the surface of the
photocatalyst and react with O2 to produce O2–•, enhancing the dye degradation initially. Figure 7b shows the first-order
kinetic plot varying with time supporting the above observations.
There is 3.4 times decrease in the rate constant when benzoquinone
(7.7 × 10–3 min–1) was introduced
into the system in comparison to the control (26.4 × 10–3 min–1). The photochemical reactions that follows
during the degradation process are as follows 4   5   6   7   8   9  The catalyst recyclability
and stability is
an important factor in heterogeneous catalysis. Thus, recyclability
of the synthesized ZnIn2S4 catalyst has been
carried out to understand the variation in the reactivity of the samples
with consecutive reuse, till 10 cycles (Figure 7c). After each of the photochemical experiments,
the catalyst was separated from the dye solution via centrifugation,
washed with water and ethanol, followed by drying at 70 °C for
12 h in hot air oven. The dried catalyst was then reused for the second
experiment consecutively. However, it can be noticed that the dye
degradation decreased slightly with each consecutive recycle, suggesting
that first run has the highest degradation efficiency, which decreases
with the increasing number of reuse cycles. This decrease is due to
the loss of catalyst during the process of recycling and also due
to the blockage of active sites, resulting in less activity compared
to the pristine powder. A difference of ∼9% after the 10th
run indicates that the catalyst is stable and recyclable. The surface
area of the catalyst before and after reuse was measured, and a difference
of 7 m2/g was observed. Thus, the above data confirm that
the active surface site also decreases with decrease in the surface
area; therefore, the photocatalytic activity drops in consecutive
experimental runs.

reaction

50 mg/50 mL 20 ppm MO, temperature 25 ± 2 °C, scavenger
concentration 1 mM); (c) catalyst reusability studies; and (d) degradation
profile for MO in the presence of natural sunlight (solar).

ZnIn2S4 is
a visible light active photocatalyst;
thus, the experiments are also performed under natural solar light
and compared with the above experiments to understand the difference
in efficiency with reduced time interval. Figure 7d presents the comparative plot of C/Co for the photocatalysis
performed under natural sunlight (solar) and visible light. Similar
to the previous experiments, photolysis of the dye was carried out
under sunlight to understand the degradation of dye under the influence
of sunlight. The photolysis of MO dye under sunlight was ∼22%.
MO degradation under natural sunlight was 90% in the first 60 min,
out of which 70% degradation happens in 30 min. On the other hand,
degradation under visible light was only 55% in 30 min and 75% in
60 min. The complete degradation of 20 ppm MO was achieved within
90 min in the presence of natural sunlight without any oxidizer using
hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower structure. The probable
reason behind complete degradation within less time could also be
attributed to the 3–5% of UV light being constituted in the
radial distribution of the natural sunlight. Comparison of the photocatalytic
results of different ZnIn2S4 morphologies/structures
with the present work (Table 2), it is promisingly efficient catalyst for visible light
driven photocatalysis for the degradation of organic pollutants.

2.6 Photocatalytic Studies of Chlorinated Phenols
Chlorinated phenols are typical organic pollutants possessing serious
threat to the water systems, as they are colorless pollutants and
nonbiodegradable. The photocatalytic activity of the optimized hierarchical
ZnIn2S4 flower structure has been investigated
for the degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
(2,4,6-TCP) under irradiation of natural sunlight. Figure 8a illustrates the degradation
profile of 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP, respectively. To understand the
possibility of degradation by sunlight irradiation, the blank experiment
was carried out where the organic contaminants were degraded without
any catalyst. The photolytic results suggests that the photosensitized
self-decomposition of these colorless pollutants under the present
experimental conditions is nearly 12 and 15% for 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP,
respectively. Moreover, there is an appreciable adsorption of 60 and
38% of 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP on the catalyst surface. Similar to the
experiments carried out for dye degradation, herealso, the absorbance
values for adsorption are considered as the initial concentration
of the chlorinated phenols. Almost 80% of the degradation takes place
within 15 min, and then gradual complete degradation of the pollutant
has been observed, where 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP is completely degraded
within 120 and 75 min, respectively. The photodegradation of these
nonbiodegradable colorless compounds has been found to be effective
and faster in the presence of natural sunlight. The above results
also suggest that the degradation becomes faster with increase in
substitution.

Figure 8 (a) Degradation profile of chlorinated phenols under natural
sunlight;
(b) schematic photocatalytic mechanism via hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower structures; and (c) time-resolved total organic
carbon (TOC) plot for MO, 2,4-DCP, and 2,4,6-TCP.

A comparison of the degradation efficiencies of both the
chlorinated
phenols shows that the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP)
was much faster than that of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). These divergences
in the same reaction could be due to the efficient attack at the chlorinated
positions by reactive oxygen species and also due to no expected chain
reaction of the generated chlorine radicals (Cl•) during the photochemical reaction. There is also a possibility
of autocatalysis, which is a simultaneous attack from the Cl• radical.49−51 The above analysis indicates that the degradation
of highly chlorinated phenol is more rapid and favorable than the
less-chlorinated phenols because of the increase in the production
of chloride ions. Consecutively, the as-synthesized ZnIn2S4 acts as a potential photocatalyst in the degradation
of dye colorants and also phenolic systems for efficient remediation
toward environmental contaminants.

It is quite usual to point
out that the high surface area of hierarchical
structures mainly contributes to the improvement in the photocatalytic
activity, and the increase in photoabsorption due to the interspace
between the petals also increases the efficiency of degradation. Another
major advantage is the enhanced adsorption that enables the fast photocatalysis
via superoxide radicals preventing the recombination of electron–hole
due to proficient photochemical reactions, as shown in Figure 8b. All of these considerations
suggest that the as-synthesized hierarchical ZnIn2S4 flower structures are potentially useful photocatalysts for
many versatile organic pollutants.

The photochemical degradation
reaction can undergo both decolorization
and mineralization processes. To further confirm these occurrences,
the total organic carbon (TOC) content in the solution taken at regular
intervals was evaluated for both the dye and chlorinated phenols.
The TOC/TOCo values are plotted against solar irradiation
time and have been shown in Figure 8c. It can be observed that the total organic carbon
decreased nearly 70, 55, and 63% for MO, 2,4-DCP, and 2,4,6-TCP after
90 min of solar irradiation, respectively. The TOC results suggest
that the photochemical process in case of MO dye not only undergoes
decolorization but also mineralizes the dye solution to a greater
extent, whereas the colorless chlorinated phenols are also observed
to be mineralized. Thus, it is clear from the figure that not only
decolorization but also mineralization takes place during photocatalytic
reaction using ZnIn2S4 flowers as photocatalyst
under natural sunlight.

3 Conclusions
The
processing parameters and the precursor concentration play
a major role in the development of hexagonal hierarchical ZnIn2S4 marigold-like flower architectures. The enhancement
in the photocatalytic degradation of MO under visible light can be
credited to the increase in the dye adsorption due to open cavities
in the flower structure facilitating active sites for adsorption and
catalysis. The photocatalytic degradation of MO in the system was
investigated to be via the superoxide radical that acts as the key
active species in the oxidation process. The catalytic activity can
be improved by adding hole scavengers to inhibit the recombination
of holes and electrons, resulting in more electrons reducing oxygen
to superoxide radicals. Complete degradation of both dye and chlorinated
phenols was observed within 90 min under natural sunlight irradiation.
The catalyst showed efficient recyclability and reusability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of ZnIn2S4 Architectures
In a typical synthesis process,
stoichiometric
ratios of zinc nitrate pentahydrate (Zn(NO3)3·5H2O) and indium nitrate pentahydrate (In(NO3)3·5H2O) were dissolved in 30 mL
distilled water. A stoichiometric amount of thiourea (CH4N2S) was added to the above solution and stirred magnetically
to obtain complete dissolution of the compounds. The resulting solution
was then transferred to a Teflon-lined beaker having a volume capacity
of 60 mL. The capped beaker was put inside a stainless steel autoclave
and sealed tightly for hydrothermal treatment at a predetermined temperature
in a muffle furnace. After certain time intervals, the autoclave was
cooled to room temperature and the precipitate together with the solvent
was centrifuged at 5000 rpm to separate the precipitate from the solvent.
The precipitate was washed thoroughly with water and absolute ethanol.
The centrifuged precipitate was dried at 70 °C for 12 h. The
concentration of thiourea played a major role in the formation of
crystal phase. Thus, hydrothermal experiments were conducted by varying
the ratio of thiourea in the precursor solution. Furthermore, a series
of experiments were carried out with varying hydrothermal temperature
and time to optimize the crystal structure and morphology. The hydrothermally
obtained powders were characterized for their crystallinity, crystal
structure, and morphology by different techniques given below.

4.2 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were recorded on Rigaku Miniflex 600 X-ray diffractometer
having Cu Kα target with a step size of 0.01 and at the scan
rate of 4°/min. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging was
performed using Ultra-55, FESEM Carl Zeiss. TEM samples were prepared
by drop casting the dilute ethanolic solution of dispersed photocatalyst
on the carbon-coated Cu grid followed by drying in a vacuum desiccator
overnight. The specific BET surface areas of the synthesized photocatalysts
were measured in a Smart Sorb 92/93 surface area analyzer by nitrogen
adsorption/desorption. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed on an ESCA+, Omicron Nanotechnology, Oxford Instruments,
Germany, equipped with monochromator Aluminum Source (Al Kα
radiation hυ = 1486.7 eV). UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra were measured using PerkinElmer UV/vis/NIR Lambda
750 spectrophotometer equipped with integrating sphere. Photoluminescence
spectra were recorded on LS-55 with 450 W continuous xenon arc lamp
as the excitation source and excitation wavelength of 350 nm.

4.3 Photocatalytic Studies
Methyl orange
(MO) was taken as a model pollutant to evaluate the photocatalytic
property of the optimized photocatalyst. The concentration of the
standard stock solution of MO was 20 mg/L. For each of the photocatalytic
experiments, catalyst concentration was maintained at 1 g/L. Metal
halide lamp (Philips India Ltd.) with λmax around
510 nm was used to perform all of the photodegradation experiments.
The lamp was cooled down using the surrounding water jacket connected
to the chiller for maintaining the reaction at room temperature. The
intensity and the photon flux of the metal halide lamp were determined
to be 10–7 einstein/s and 220 μW/cm2, respectively. The reaction suspension containing catalyst and dye
solution was continuously stirred in dark conditions to reach an adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. During the catalytic reaction, 2 mL of suspension was
taken out at certain time intervals followed by centrifuging at 3000
rpm to separate the catalyst from the dye solution. The absorbance
of the clear dye solution was measured by a UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The percentage of degradation was calculated as follows: % degradation
= ((Co – Ct)/Co) ×
100, where Co and Ct are the initial (after adsorption) and final absorbance
(after photocatalysis) at time t, respectively. Dye
solution was also degraded in the presence of light to understand
the photolysis process. All of the sunlight experiments were carried
out between 12 and 2 p.m., as the fluctuations in solar intensity
are minimal in this duration. The variation in solar intensity was
recorded using the Eppley PSP 32483F3 radiometer, Newport. The average
solar intensity observed was 0.768 kW/m2. For investigating
the active species involved in photodegradation of 20 ppm MO using
the optimized catalyst, scavengers were added to the dye solution.
The scavengers taken were t-butyl alcohol for hydroxyl
radicals (OH•), benzoquinone for superoxide radicals
(O2–•), glycerol for holes (h+), and dimethyl sulfoxide for electrons (e–). The scavenger of 1 mM concentration was added to the reaction
solution
in the dark reaction (before switching on the light).

Apart
from the dye degradation, the catalyst was also used to monitor the
degradation of chlorinated phenols, namely, dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP)
and trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP). However, the standard stock concentration
was 50 mg/L. The samples were taken at definite intervals after degradation,
and the concentration was determined based on the absorbance at λmax of 280 nm with UV detector using high-performance liquid
chromatography (Waters Inc.). C18 column (Poroshell 120) and 50/50
acetonitrile/water with 0.5% formic acid was used as the eluent at
a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.

The total organic carbon (TOC) of
both the dye solution and chlorinated
phenols at different time intervals of the photochemical reaction
was analyzed with the Shimadzu, TOC VCSNanalyzer.
