Coalescence-induced
condensate droplet jumping from superhydrophobic
surfaces can be exploited in condensation heat-transfer enhancement,
imparting self-cleaning behavior to surfaces, anti-icing coatings,
and other industrial uses. An intriguing application would exploit
this phenomenon to achieve thermal rectification using a sealed vapor
chamber with opposing superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces.
During forward operation, continuous evaporation occurs from the heated
superhydrophilic evaporator surface; self-propelled jumping returns
the condensate droplets from the cooler superhydrophobic surface to
the evaporator, allowing passive recirculation of the working fluid
without a reliance on gravity or capillary wicking for fluid return.
In reverse operation, when the superhydrophobic surface is heated,
the absence of a mechanism for fluid return from the cooler superhydrophilic
side to the evaporator restricts heat transport across the (low conductivity)
vapor gap. The effectiveness of this jumping-droplet thermal diode
can be enhanced by maximizing the distance between the opposing superhydrophobic
and superhydrophilic surfaces. It is, therefore, important to investigate
the height to which the condensate droplets jump from the superhydrophobic
surfaces such that replenishment of liquid to the superhydrophilic
surface is maintained. In this study, we systematically investigate
the height to which the condensate droplets jump from the hierarchical
superhydrophobic surfaces having truncated microcones coated with
nanostructures. The condensate droplet jumping height increases with
a decrease in microcone pitch. A general theoretical model that accounts
for surface adhesion, line tension, and initial wetting states of
multiple coalescing droplets of different radii is used to predict
and explain the experimentally observed trend of droplet jumping height
with surface roughness. The insights provided regarding the effect
of surface topography on droplet jumping height are critical to the
design of high-performance thermal diode devices.

1 Introduction
When
vapor condenses on an ultralow-adhesion nanostructured superhydrophobic
surface, the resulting condensate droplets can jump away from the
surface upon coalescence. This “coalescence-induced droplet
jumping” is self-propelled by excess surface energy released
upon coalescence.1−8 The jumping of condensate droplets has been observed on naturally
occurring superhydrophobic surfaces, including lotus leaves,9 cicada wings,10 water
strider legs,11 and gecko skin.12 Inspired by the structure of these surfaces,
various nanostructured13−15 or hierarchical micro-/nanostructured3,16−22 surfaces have been fabricated to achieve condensate droplet jumping
behavior. The jumping of condensate droplets is of significant interest
owing to their potential for enhancing the performance of a variety
of functional surfaces for applications including self-cleaning surfaces,10−12 condensation heat transfer,10,13−25 anti-icing surfaces,26−28 energy harvesting,29 and
power generation.30 Beyond these demonstrated
applications, the self-propelled condensate droplet jumping from superhydrophobic
surfaces also has the potential for applications in thermal diode
devices comprising a sealed vapor chamber with opposing superhydrophobic
and superhydrophilic plates.31,32 Evaporative heat transport
occurs when the superhydrophilic surface side is heated; self-propelled
jumping droplets return condensed working fluid from the superhydrophobic
condenser to the superhydrophilic evaporator. In the reverse operating
direction, when the superhydrophobic surface is heated, the fluid
condensed on the superhydrophilic surface has no mechanism to return
to the heated superhydrophobic side; heat transport must occur through
conduction/convection across the vapor space. The effectiveness of
this thermal diode can be enhanced by maximizing the spacing between
the superhydrophobic condenser and superhydrophilic evaporator surfaces.32 However, there exists an upper limit of spacing
beyond which the jumping condensate droplets cannot reach the superhydrophilic
surface. Therefore, it is important to investigate the jumping height
of condensate droplets from the superhydrophobic surfaces so that
the surfaces may be designed for operation at large spacings. Although
there has been a great interest in exploiting superhydrophobic surfaces
for enhanced dropwise condensation,13−25 none have characterized this jumping height that is of critical
importance to thermal diodes.

We developed a new experimental
approach to characterize the condensate
droplet jumping height on hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces featuring
nanostructured truncated microcones. The effect of surface roughness
(namely, microstructure pitch) on the condensate droplet jumping height
was systematically investigated. A general theoretical model that
takes into account the surface adhesion, line tension, and droplet
wetting states of multiple coalescing droplets of different radii
was developed to explain the underlying mechanisms that lead to the
observed jumping height dependence on surface roughness.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characteristics of the
Superhydrophobic Surfaces
Figure 1 shows the
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the hierarchical superhydrophobic
surfaces, which consist of nanostructured truncated microcones on
a silicon substrate, and these are denoted as P40, P50, and P60 based
on the microcone pitches, P, of 40, 50, and 60 μm,
respectively. For all of the surfaces, the top (D1) and base (D2) diameters
of the truncated microcones are ∼16 and ∼32 μm,
respectively; the microcone height (H) and the slant
height (L) are ∼11 and ∼13.6 μm,
respectively. The nanowires are ∼150 nm in diameter (Dn) and ∼1.5 μm in height (Hn), at a pitch (Pn) of ∼500 nm. For comparison purposes, a baseline nanostructured
sample (Nano) without microcones was fabricated using a single-step
metal-assisted chemical etching process. All sample surfaces were
silanized to render them superhydrophobic;3 water contact angles of ∼165° and contact angle hysteresis
values of less than 1° were measured.

truncated microcone surfaces with
pitches of (a) 40, (b) 50, (c) and 60 μm and (d) a nanostructured
surface without microcones (denoted as P40, P50, P60, and Nano, respectively).
An enlarged view of nanostructures on the hierarchical and flat nanostructured
surfaces is shown in the inset of panel (d).

2.2 Measurement of Condensate Droplet Jumping
Height
Condensation experiments were carried out in an ambient
environment at a temperature of ∼20 °C and a relative
humidity of ∼40%. The condensation setup developed to measure
the condensate droplet jumping height on the sample surface is shown
in Figure 2. The sample
was attached to a temperature-controlled cooling stage (CP-031, TE
Technology, Inc.) set at 0 °C. The condensation process is visualized
for 30 min using a camera (EO-5023M, Edmund Optics) and a high-magnification
zoom lens (VH-Z100R, Keyence) with in-line illumination provided by
a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Titan 300, Sunoptic Technologies). To observe
the distribution of condensate droplets during dropwise condensation,
the lens was focused on each sample surface with a 0.3 mm × 0.23
mm field of view. To measure the jumping height of the condensate
droplet, separate experiments were performed under the same conditions
with a glass slide inserted between the camera and the surface; the
lens was focused on the underside of the glass slide (facing the sample)
with a larger field of view of 1.53 mm × 1.14 mm. Condensate
droplets that coalesce and jump a sufficient distance from the surface
can be observed to impact the glass slide. The image on the left of Figure 2 shows a representative
snapshot of condensate droplets attached to the glass slide after
they have jumped from sample P40. The spacing between the glass slide
and the sample surface (S) was varied from 0.3 to
6.5 mm to investigate the number of coalesced droplets that jump to
these different heights. Testing at a spacing smaller than 0.3 mm
resulted in condensation on the glass slide. It should be noted that
the number of droplets impacting the glass slide is comparable when
the sample is placed vertically (as shown in Figure 2) and horizontally (facing upward against
gravity), indicating that jumping height is orientation-independent
(section S1). In this experiment, the vertical
orientation is used to eliminate the influence of falling droplets
on the droplet jumping.

Figure 2 Schematic drawing of the experimental setup
used to measure the
condensate droplet jumping height (right). The image on the left shows
a representative snapshot of condensate droplets impacting the glass
slide after they have jumped from surface P40.

2.3 Condensate Droplet Jumping from the Surfaces
To determine the total number of condensate droplets jumping from
each surface, the condensation process on the sample surface was visualized. Figure 3 shows selected snapshots
of dropwise condensation on the four surfaces. The images on each
panel show the moment before droplet coalescence (left) and after
departure by jumping (right), as indicated by the solid and dashed
lines, respectively. Such a coalescence-induced departure is counted
as one coalesced jumping droplet; the total number of coalesced jumping
droplets per square millimeter (the areal density of condensate droplets)
occurring on each surface within the field of view (0.3 mm ×
0.23 mm) over 30 min is counted (see Table 1). Note that the coalescence events for droplets
smaller than ∼3 μm were not counted owing to measurement
uncertainties.

(b) P50, (c) P60, and (d) Nano. The images on the left in each pair
show the moment before the outlined group of droplets coalesced, and
the images on the right show the moment just after departure by coalescence-induced
jumping. The scale bars are 100 μm.

To assess the height
to which the droplets jump, the glass slide
is visualized during condensation, and the areal density of droplets
impacting the slide within the field of view (1.53 mm × 1.14
mm) over the testing period (30 min) is counted. Each sample surface
at each spacing between the glass slide and the surface (S) was tested at least three times, observing the glass slide at different
locations to ensure that the number of droplets counted among all
tests at each spacing for a given sample varied by less than 10%,
and the mean values are reported. Figure 4 shows the areal density of condensate droplets
impacting the glass slide for different spacings, S, for the four samples. It is observed that there are few jumping
droplets that reach the glass slide as the spacing is increased for
all samples. A significant decrease in the number of droplets impacting
the glass slide is observed when the spacing S increases
from 0.3 to 1 mm. An enlarged view of the plot area for the larger
spacings (inset of Figure 4) shows that there are relatively few jumping droplets impacting
the glass slide at a spacing of 3.5 mm and larger.

Figure 4 Areal density of coalesced
jumping droplets that impact the glass
slide for different spacings from each sample over 30 min; the inset
shows an enlarged view for the larger spacings. The error bars represent
the variation in the measured areal density across the repeated experimental
trials for each corresponding sample.

2.4 Droplet Jumping Height
The data shown
in Figure 4 are the
areal densities of the droplets that jump to or higher than a given
height (i.e., spacing between the camera and the glass slide, S) for each sample. To assess the average droplet jumping
height, we calculated the areal density of droplets that jump to specific
height ranges. For instance, the areal density of droplets jumping
in the range of 0–0.3 mm can be deduced by subtracting the
areal density of droplets that impact the glass slide at a spacing
of 0.3 mm from the total areal density of droplets that jump from
the surface. The droplet counts for the rest of the jumping height
ranges can be calculated similarly based on the data shown in Figure 4, taking the difference
in the number of impacting droplets at each spacing increment. The
areal densities of droplets jumping to specific height ranges (0–0.3
mm, 0.3–1 mm, 1–2.5 mm, 2.5–3.5 mm, 3.5–5
mm, 5–6.5 mm, and >6.5 mm) for all samples are calculated,
as shown in Table 1.

The percentages of the total number of jumping droplets per
square millimeter from any surface that reach specific height ranges
are shown for each sample in Figure 5. The majority of the droplets jump less than 0.3 mm
for all surfaces, and the percentage of droplets that reach higher
jumping heights decreases for increasing heights. Here, we also observe
the effect of the microstructures on the jumping droplet height. Compared
to the surfaces with microstructures, the distribution of droplet
jumping heights from the flat nanostructured sample (Nano) is shifted
to smaller droplet heights (see the inset enlarged view). Only ∼3%
of all jumping droplets reach a height larger than 2.5 mm for sample
Nano. The shift in distribution toward larger jumping heights for
the microstructured samples also trends with the microcone pitch.
For a decreasing pitch from sample P60 to P40 (i.e., increasing microstructured
surface roughness), the distribution is shifted from smaller to larger
droplet jumping heights. For example, ∼5.2% of all jumping
droplets reach higher than 2.5 mm for sample P40 (254 droplets) versus
only ∼3.7% for sample P60 (150 droplets). This redistribution
is also reflected in the average droplet jumping height, which is
shown in Figure 6a.
The average droplet jumping height for each sample surface is calculated
as a weighted average of the mean heights of each bin (note that the
bin for >6.5 mm is dropped because of the unknown jumping height).
The average jumping height increases with a decrease in the microcone
pitch. The flat nanostructured sample (Nano) exhibits the lowest average
droplet jumping height. Given that sample P40 provides the largest
average jumping height, it has the potential to enable a jumping-droplet
thermal diode to function with a larger vapor gap, which would increase
the thermal rectification.32

jumping height ranges for each sample; the inset shows an enlarged
view of the larger jumping heights.

height and (b) theoretical predictions for each sample. Although the
vertical axis range of panel (b) is shifted, it has the same scaling
as that of panel (a) for the purpose of comparing the trend in the
jumping height.

2.5 Theoretical
Modeling of Droplet Jumping Height
A theoretical analysis
is performed to understand the observed
experimental trend in droplet jumping height with surface roughness.
While our experiments were conducted with the surface in an orthogonal
orientation with respect to gravity, in the analysis, we treat the
jumping droplet as an object propelled vertically upward at an initial
speed Uj, with the maximum height determined
by the air resistance and gravitational forces. Through this analysis,
we will assess the relative importance of the gravitational resistance
and comment on the suitability of comparing the model to our experiments.
The initial droplet jumping speed is predicted using a coalescence-induced
jumping model that we developed previously, which is modified to account
for surface adhesion, line tension, and initial wetting states of
multiple coalescing droplets of different radii.3 On the basis of the experimental visualizations of the
dropwise condensation process occurring on the sample surfaces, we
measured the number and the radius of coalescing droplets that result
in jumping events during the 30 min experiment on each sample surface
(Figures S3 and S4) and calculated the
droplet jumping height for each jumping event. The average calculated
droplet jumping height of all jumping events on each sample surface
is then compared with the experimentally measured data to verify the
model. Note that the initial wetting states of the droplets before
coalescence were considered. On the hierarchical superhydrophobic
surfaces, the condensate droplets may reside in a composite state,
where the droplet is larger than the microstructures and sits in contact
with at least two truncated microcones. Alternatively, when the droplets
are much smaller than the microstructures, they sit in a Cassie state
on the nanostructures; all droplets are in the Cassie state for the
flat nanostructured surface. Droplet coalescence can occur for various
combinations of such Cassie- and composite-state droplets on the hierarchical
surfaces with different microcone pitches, which affects their initial
surface energy and resulting jumping velocity.

Previous theoretical
models that predict droplet jumping velocities are based on energetic
arguments; an ad hoc form of viscous dissipation has been typically
included in the energy balance,5−8 which may overestimate the viscous dissipation. For
example, some studies report that the coalescence of droplets below
a critical radius (∼10–20 μm) does not lead to
jumping on a superhydrophobic surface owing to the dominant viscous
dissipation during coalescence.5−8 However, experimental and numerical studies have
demonstrated that the coalescence of smaller droplets (<10 μm,
even down to nanometer size) could cause the droplets to jump away
from the surfaces.4,33−35 Recent studies
have provided strong evidence that viscous dissipation is not important
at length scales larger than 1 μm.4,35,36 Instead, finite surface adhesion and unequal momentum
flow in the vertical direction govern and limit the droplet jumping.4,37 The droplet jumping velocity Uj has
been numerically simulated to be ∼0.23× the characteristic
jumping velocity U0 given by the capillary-inertial
scaling for the coalescence of two equally sized droplets on a nonwetting
surface with an apparent advancing contact angle of 180° and
zero adhesion.4,37 In this study, we assume that
the internal flow momentum generated during two-droplet coalescence
is identical for the multiple-droplet coalescence case, with the same
proportionality constant of ∼0.23.4,37 Furthermore,
we consider the dissipation forces induced by surface adhesion and
contact line tension between the condensate droplets and the surface.

When droplet coalescence occurs, if all of the released surface
energy ΔEs (ΔEs = Es – Es′,
where Es and Es′ are the
surface energy before and after droplet coalescence) after balancing
the interfacial adhesion-induced dissipation energy Eadh and line-tension-induced dissipation energy Eline is converted to kinetic energy Ek, then 1  where Ek = 1/2mU02, m = 2/3πρR′3(2 – 3 cos θ + cos3 θ) is the mass of the jumping droplet, R′ is the radius of the jumping droplet, and U0 is the corresponding characteristic jumping velocity.

However, because of the incomplete conversion of the excess energy
to translational kinetic energy as a result of limited momentum to
provide droplet jumping, the actual droplet jumping velocity Uj is estimated to be ∼0.23× the
characteristic jumping velocity given by eq 1, which is expressed as 2  where
θ = 165° is the apparent
contact angle of the droplet, R1, R2···RN are the radii of condensate droplets before coalescence,
and N is the number of coalescing droplets. The energy
expressions of Es, Es′, Eadh, and Eline for
multiple Cassie-state droplets (R1,C, R2,C, ......RN,C) and multiple composite-state droplets (R1,comp, R2,comp, ......RN,comp) have been derived in
our previous work3 and are given below.

The surface energy equations of multiple Cassie-state droplets
(Es,C) and multiple composite-state droplets
(Es,comp) are, respectively, expressed
as follows 3   4  where fn = πDn2/4Pn2 and rn = 1 +
πDnHn/Pn2 are the solid fraction
and surface roughness
of the nanowires, respectively; rf = 1
+ [0.5πL(D1 + D2) + 0.25π(D12 – D22)]/P2 is the surface roughness of the truncated
microcones; σlv, σsl, and σsv are the liquid–vapor, solid–liquid, and solid–vapor
surface tensions, respectively; and θe ≈ 115°
is the equilibrium contact angle with water on the silane-coated flat
and smooth surface. The surface energy of multiple Cassie-state droplets
coalesced with multiple composite-state droplets can be obtained by
summing the corresponding surface energy obtained from eqs 3 and 4.

The surface energy of a coalesced jumping droplet (Es′)
is expressed as 5  

The dissipation
energies during multiple-droplet coalescence are
determined by the surface morphology, solid–liquid contact
area, and solid–liquid contact line length. The adhesion-induced
energy dissipation energies for the coalescence of multiple Cassie-state
droplets (Eadh,C) and multiple composite-state
droplets (Eadh,comp) are given below 6   7  

The line-tension-induced
energy dissipation at the triple line
for the coalescence of multiple Cassie-state droplets (Eline,C) and multiple composite-state droplets (Eline,comp) is expressed, respectively, as 8   9  

On the basis of the measured coalescing droplet
radius, the theoretical
droplet jumping velocity Uj (eq 2) can be calculated according to eqs 3–9. The calculated droplet jumping velocity Uj as a function of the jumping droplet radius for all
coalescence events on different surfaces is shown in Figure 7. The corresponding energy
budget of different jumping droplet radii on each surface is given
in Figure S5 to examine the dominant forces
during the jumping process. The high scatter in the droplet jumping
velocity for each surface in Figure 7 is due to the coalescence of multiple droplets of
unequal radii. By fitting the scatter data to the allometric function
(y = axb, the red curve on each panel), we found that the droplet jumping
velocity decreases with an increase in jumping droplet radius, and
the value falls between 0.25 and 1.5 m/s for all surfaces, depending
on the number and size of coalescing droplets and the surface morphology.
The trend of droplet jumping velocity with the jumping droplet radius
is in accordance with the experimental observations by Kim et al.37 and Cha et al.,38 and the average droplet jumping velocity on our nanostructured surface
(∼0.7 m/s) is comparable to their measured values on surfaces
with nanostructures only (0.5–0.6 m/s),37,38 indicating that our model can well-predict the droplet jumping velocity.

Figure 7 Calculated
droplet jumping velocity as a function of the jumping
droplet radius on different superhydrophobic surfaces. The red curve
in each panel is the fitted value of droplet jumping velocity for
all coalescence cases during 30 min of condensation; the colors of
symbols in each panel represent the jumping velocity induced by the
same number of coalescing droplets.

To calculate the droplet jumping height, we consider the
gravitational
(Fg) and frictional (Fa) forces acting against the droplet motion in air. Note
that the drag force due to vapor flow toward the condensing surface
can be neglected for our experimental conditions (section S4). The equation of droplet motion at any time t is given by 10  where Fg = mg is the gravitational force and g = 9.8
m/s2 is the gravitational acceleration. According to Stokes’
law, for low Reynolds number , the friction force is expressed as Fa = kU(t),
where k = 6πηaR′ is the air friction coefficient, ηa = 1.827
× 10–5 Pa·s is the viscosity of air, and U(t) is the vertical jumping speed at time t.

Integrating the droplet jumping speed U(t) from time 0 to tm {the time
required for the droplet to jump to the maximum height at which U(t) is zero, tm = −(m/k)ln[mg/(mg + Ujk)]}, the droplet jumping height is calculated as 11  

We calculated the droplet jumping height of each coalescence
event
on different sample surfaces using the measured radius of the coalescing
droplet. The average droplet jumping height of all jumping events
on each sample surface is then compared with the experimentally measured
data, as shown in Figure 6. It should be noted that if we only consider the gravitational
force on the droplet jumping behavior, the respective maximum droplet
jumping heights are ∼10 times larger than the values with air
friction included. This confirms that the influence of gravity on
the droplet jumping height is negligible compared with the air friction
force. From Figure 6, it can be seen that the trends of the theoretical data with the
microstructured surface roughness follow the experiments. That is,
the jumping height increases with the decreasing microcone pitch for
the microstructured surfaces, which all yield a greater jumping height
than the flat nanostructured surface. The larger droplet jumping height
on the hierarchical surface with a smaller microstructure pitch is
likely due to the larger percentage of composite-state droplets that
the surface enables. According to eqs 3 and 4, the surface energy before
coalescence of multiple composite-state droplets is larger than that
of multiple Cassie-state droplets, which results in an increased corresponding
energy released upon coalescence, yielding an increased droplet jumping
height on the hierarchical surface with a smaller microcone pitch.

We note that the theory overpredicts the jumping heights relative
to the measured values. This may be attributed to the fact that this
theory assumes that the complex fluid dynamics occurring during the
coalescence between the two equally sized droplets on the superhydrophobic
surface is identical to that in the multiple-droplet coalescence case.
This assumption implies that the magnitude of the internal flow momentum
generated by the coalescence of two droplets equals that of the multiple-droplet
coalescence cases. However, the internal flow momentum necessary to
enable droplet jumping should be somewhat different for the cases
of multiple-droplet coalescence in the experiments because on the
hierarchical superhydrophobic surface, droplets with uneven sizes,
different wetting states, initial positions, or arrangements are more
likely to coalesce, which could alter the droplet coalescence dynamics
substantially. In particular, the uneven coalescence of multiple droplets
may create momentum in various directions away from the surface normal,
causing the measured droplet jumping height to be decreased. Such
a decrease is not considered in the theoretical predictions, which
would cause the theory to overpredict the experiments.

3 Conclusions
We systematically investigated the effect
of surface topography
on the coalescence-induced droplet jumping height during dropwise
condensation on hierarchical superhydrophobic surfaces. The droplet
jumping height exhibits dependence on the microstructured surface
roughness of the substrate; the jumping height increases with a decrease
in the pitch of truncated microcone features on the surface. To explain
the mechanisms underlying the droplet jumping height observed in the
experiments, an energy-based model for the jumping dynamics is employed.
The initial speed of the jumping droplet is predicted based on the
difference between the surface energy released during coalescence
and the dissipation energies between the droplets and the surface,
taking into account the different initial droplet wetting states on
each surface. This initial droplet jumping speed is used to estimate
the jumping height. The trend in variation of the theoretically predicted
jumping droplet height as a function of the sample microstructure
pitch is consistent with the experimental data; namely, a higher surface
energy for droplets in the composite state, which are more prevalent
on surfaces with a smaller microstructure pitch, results in an increased
energy transfer to the released droplet upon coalescence, which increases
the droplet jumping height. The insights provided by this study, specifically
regarding the role of surface roughness in governing the coalescence-induced
droplet jumping height, can guide efforts to improve hierarchical
superhydrophobic surface designs for jumping-droplet thermal diode
devices and in other applications for which this behavior governs
performance.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Fabrication of Superhydrophobic Surfaces
We fabricated
nanostructured truncated microcones on a silicon
substrate using a two-step wet-etching process that we developed previously.3 Briefly, the truncated microcones were first
created using photolithography and anisotropic tetramethylammonium
hydroxide etching, following which the nanostructures were etched
across the entire surface using a metal-assisted chemical etching
process. Surfaces with center-to-center microcone spacings were fabricated
by varying the photolithography mask patterns.
