Coal char was gasified using subcritical steam with/without
a CO2 sorbent (CaO) and/or a hydrogen separation membrane
(palladium-23% silver) in a batch/semibatch autoclave reactor to investigate
the kinetics in terms of the effect of hydrogen separation at 590–650
°C and 1.9–2.4 MPa in order to support a hydrogen production
process of the HyPr-RING method. CO2 sorption by CaO affects
the production rate of H2 but scarcely affected the carbon
conversion to gas. Hydrogen separation promotes the hydrogen production
in spite of the absence of CO2 sorption. The effect of
hydrogen separation on hydrogen yield and carbon conversion was higher
than that of CO2 sorption. A higher gasification temperature
increased the hydrogen yield and carbon conversion. Using a first-order
reaction form in parallel, the gasification reaction mechanism was
explained for the components of the volatile matter and char in coal
char. A higher reaction temperature results in an increase of the
values of any kinetic constant for subcritical steam gasification
of Adaro coal char with/without CaO and/or a hydrogen separation membrane.
CO2 sorption promoted hydrogen production due to the tar
from volatiles with the catalytic effects of CaO, whereas hydrogen
separation promoted hydrogen production due to char.

Introduction
The clean use of carbonous resources such
as low-rank coal, biomass, and organic wastes is desired due to fossil
fuel depletion and global environment problems. Careful consideration
to minimize CO2 emissions is required in energy generated
from organic matters; however, a stable supply of hydrogen is critical
to construct a clean and efficient energy system such as fuel cells.
The gasification of carbonous resources with steam is a key technology
currently applied in the development of hydrogen generation.

The HyPr-RING process is one of new hydrogen production methods from
organic matters using steam under high pressure, without CO2 emissions using a Ca-based sorbent.1−26Figure 1, shown in
our previous work,27−30 is a diagrammatic representation of this concept. By the reaction
of organic matters using steam and Ca-based sorbents, hydrogen and
calcium carbonate are mainly produced. By calcining CaCO3, it can be regenerated to CaO with a high concentration of CO2.

Figure 1 Concept of the proposed hydrogen production (HyPr-RING) method.27−30

The following reactions are those occurring within
a reactor in the HyPr-RING process.

Steam gasification 1  

Water–gas shift reaction 2  

CaO hydration 3  

Ca(OH)2 carbonation 4  Here, in eqs 1–4, “(s)”
and “(g)” denote solid and gas phases, respectively.

The enthalpy required for steam gasification is compensated by
the enthalpies of CaO hydration and Ca(OH)2 carbonation.
CO is converted to CO2 and H2 via eq 2 with Ca(OH)2 carbonation
by eq 4. The overall
stoichiometric reaction can be written by combining eqs 1–4, as follows 5  

The steam gasification of the organic
material with CO2 sorption by Ca(OH)2 requires
high-pressure conditions, according to thermodynamic analysis. The
kinetics of the gasification of organic materials such as Taiheiyo
coal (Japanese sub-bituminous coal), Adaro coal (Indonesian sub-bituminous
coal), and dried sewage sludge with steam and calcium hydrate at 600–727
°C and 3–20 MPa were investigated in our previous work.27−30

By the use of membranes, particularly palladium (Pd)-based
metallic membranes, high purity hydrogen can be separated from gas
mixtures.31−34 However, the impurities, particularly H2S, in the gas
stream affect the surface of Pd membranes.35−37 The alloying
of Pd membranes can improve the hydrogen flux and resistance to surface
poisoning.31,38−40 In addition,
temperatures more than 350 °C and large differential pressures
across the membrane surface can efficiently operate Pd-based membranes.41

In this report, Adaro coal char gasification
with subcritical steam was carried out with/without CaO with/without
a hydrogen separation membrane [Pd-23% silver (Ag)] in a batch/semibatch
autoclave reactor to consider the kinetics in terms of the effect
of hydrogen separation at 590–650 °C and 1.9–2.4
MPa in the application of the HyPr-RING method, as shown in Figure 2.

production (HyPr-RING) method.

Results and Discussion
Effect of CO2 Sorption on the H2 Production
Rate and Carbon Conversion to Gas
Figures 3 and 4 show the changes
in the H2 production rate and carbon conversion to gas,
respectively, with/without CaO and with/without the hydrogen separation
membrane with the reaction time for subcritical steam gasification
at 650 °C and 1.9–2.4 MPa. In this case, the carbon conversion
to gas was evaluated stoichiometrically based on eqs 1, 2, and 6 based on the amount of H2 gas produced via the
membrane and the produced H2 and CH4 gases that
remained in the reactor after cooling.

separation membrane with reaction time for subcritical steam gasification
at 650 °C and 1.9–2.4 MPa.

Figure 4 Changes in carbon conversion to gas with/without CaO and
with/without the hydrogen separation membrane with reaction time for
subcritical steam gasification with the hydrogen separation membrane
at 650 °C and 1.9–2.4 MPa.

Hydrogasification 6  

The H2 production rates
for subcritical steam gasification without and with CaO in the absence
of the hydrogen separation membrane were maximum at a reaction time
of approximately 90 min. The total H2 production amounts
without and with CaO were 71 and 120 mL, respectively, whereas the
carbon conversion to gas without and with CaO after the reaction time
of 1000 min was 13 and 20%, respectively. These results suggest that
CO2 sorption by CaO affected the production rate of H2 but scarcely affected the carbon conversion to gas because
more than 80% of the pressure in the reactor was due to steam.28 In addition, CO and CO2 were produced
without CaO, whereas they were not produced with CaO, according to eqs 2 and 4.

The H2 production rates for subcritical steam
gasification without and with CaO in the presence of the hydrogen
separation membrane were a maximum at a reaction time of 80–90
min. The total H2 production amounts without and with CaO
were 530 and 760 mL, respectively, whereas the carbon conversion to
gas without and with CaO after the reaction times of 1360 and 1600
min was 59 and 84%, respectively. This suggests that CO2 produced without CaO inhibited the chemical reactions represented
by eqs 1 and 2 despite hydrogen separation, whereas the CO2 sorption with CaO promoted the reactions represented by eqs 1 and 2 with hydrogen separation.1−14,16−30

Effect of Hydrogen Separation on the H2 Production
Rate and Carbon Conversion to Gas
The H2 production
rate and carbon conversion to gas with a hydrogen separation membrane
were higher than those without the membrane. The total H2 production amounts without and with the hydrogen separation membrane
in the absence of CaO were 71 and 530 mL, respectively, whereas those
in the presence of CaO were 120 and 760 mL, respectively. The final
carbon conversion to gas without and with the hydrogen separation
membrane in the absence of CaO was 13 and 59%, respectively, whereas
those in the presence of CaO were 20 and 84%, respectively. This suggests
that the H2 that remained in the reactor without the hydrogen
separation membrane inhibited the reactions represented by eqs 1 and 2 in spite of CO2 sorption, whereas hydrogen separation
promoted the reactions associated with these equations in spite of
the absence of CO2 sorption.34,36 Thus, the
effect of hydrogen separation on the hydrogen production and carbon
conversion to gas was higher than that of CO2 sorption.

Effect of Reaction Temperature on the H2 Production
Rate and Carbon Conversion to Gas
The changes in the H2 production rate and carbon conversion to gas with CaO as
a function of reaction time for subcritical steam gasification without
and with the hydrogen separation membrane at 590–650 °C
and 1.9–2.4 MPa are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

Figure 5 Changes
in the H2 production rate (solid line) and carbon conversion
to gas (dotted line) with CaO as a function of reaction time for subcritical
steam gasification without the hydrogen separation membrane at 590
°C (blue line), 620 °C (yellow line), and 650 °C (red
line).

Figure 6 Changes in the H2 production rate (solid line)
and carbon conversion to gas (dotted line) with CaO as a function
of reaction time for subcritical steam gasification with the hydrogen
separation membrane at 590 °C (blue line), 620 °C (yellow
line), and 650 °C (red line).

In Figures 5 and 6, the H2 production
rate and carbon conversion to gas with/without the hydrogen separation
membrane increased with the reaction temperature. This result is similar
to that of our previous study.27 In addition,
H2 production without the hydrogen separation membrane
seemed to be completed after the reaction time of 1000 min at 590–650
°C, whereas the H2 production time with the membrane
was longer as the reaction temperature increased. These results suggest
that the amount of reactive carbon increased with the reaction temperature
and hydrogen separation.27,29,30

Effect of CO2 Sorption and Hydrogen Separation on
Kinetics of Adaro Coal Char Gasification with Subcritical Steam
The reaction mechanism of coal gasification in the HyPr-RING process,
as considered in our previous studies,28−30 is shown in Figure 7.30

Figure 7 Reaction mechanism of coal gasification considered in the HyPr-RING
process.30

The following are assumed:30(1) Fixed carbon converted to char and
volatile matter (VM) in the form of carbon, configuring the coal.

(2) Char gasification with
steam produces H2 with k2 (s–1).

(3) Tar and hydrocarbon gases (CnHm), such as CH4, C2H4, and C2H6, are produced in pyrolysis of VM
in the form of carbon with kinetic constants k3 and k1 (s–1), respectively.

(4) Steam
gasification and pyrolysis of tar produce H2 and CnHm with k4 and k5 (s–1), respectively.

(5) The product gas does not contain CO and CO2 according to eqs 2 and 4.



The change in the logarithmic calculated line and observed
plots of residual carbon in the gasification residue with relation
to reaction time for Adaro coal char gasification with subcritical
steam in the presence of CaO and a hydrogen separation membrane at
650 °C and 1.9–2.4 MPa are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Changes in logarithmic calculated line and observed
plots of residual carbon in the gasification residue with relation
to reaction time for Adaro coal char gasification with subcritical
steam in the presence of CaO and hydrogen separation membrane at 650
°C and 1.9–2.4 MPa.

In this case, by subtracting the rate of carbon
conversion to gas from 100%, the observed plots of the residual carbon
in the figure were evaluated. Material and heat transfer, as well
as kinetics, generally control reactions.42 However, in the report, the kinetics of these step reactions are
assumed to be of pseudo-first-order reaction5 with the components of VM and char in coal char and according to eqs 7–14,30 given that the mixing mole
ratios of CaO/coal char and H2O/coal char for Adaro coal
char gasification with subcritical steam and CaO were 1.43 and 5.0
mol/molcarbon, respectively, which were in excess of the
stoichiometric amounts30 7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14  where rChar, rVM, rH2, rTar, and rCnHm are
the reaction rates (% s–1) of char, VM, H2, tar, and CnHm, respectively.30CChar, CVM, and CTar are the residual fractions (%) of char, VM, and tar,
respectively, in eqs 7–11.30C is a total of CChar and CVM in eqs 12 and 13.30 Using eq 14, from
residual fraction (C0) at the reaction
time of zero, (C1) at a reaction time
(t) can be calculated.30

Using eq 14 in Figure 8, CChar,0 and k2 were determined
to be 91.3% and 1.2 × 10–3 s–1, respectively. The values of CVM,0 and k1 + k3 were similarly
determined to be 8.7% and 1.6 × 10–3 s–1, respectively. Finally, using the Solver add-in,
being a Microsoft Excel 2010 add-in program, based on a comparison
to the observed values, all kinetic constants were determined.30

The Arrhenius plot for each kinetic constant
at 1.9–2.4 MPa for Adaro coal char gasification with subcritical
steam in the presence of CaO and a hydrogen separation membrane is
shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Arrhenius
plots for each kinetic constant at 1.9–2.4 MPa for Adaro coal
char gasification with subcritical steam in the presence of CaO and
hydrogen separation membrane.

The kinetic model is considered to be appropriate
because of the linear plots for each kinetic constant.5,30Tables 1–3 show the values for activation
energy (E) and k1 to k5 for each temperature, computed from the plots
for each kinetic constant at 1.9–2.4 MPa for subcritical steam
gasification of Adaro coal char with/without CaO and/or a hydrogen
separation membrane.

In Tables 1–3, a higher reaction temperature
resulted in an increase of the values of k1–k5 for Adaro coal char gasification
using subcritical steam with/without CaO and/or a hydrogen separation
membrane.

The k1 values in Table 3 were less than 1.3–1.9
times those in Table 2, whereas the k3, k2, and k4 values in Table 3 were more than 0.5–3.0,
0.7–1.8, and 1.2–1.5 times those in Table 1, respectively. This suggests
that CO2 sorption promotes pyrolysis of VM to tar and steam
gasification of char and tar to hydrogen due to the catalytic effects
of CaO,27 thereby inhibiting pyrolysis
of VM to hydrocarbon gases at higher reaction temperatures.

In addition, the k1 values in Table 3 were less than 2.5–2.7
times those in Table 2, whereas the k3, k2, and k4 values in Table 3 were more than 0.5–1.5,
0.9–4.0, and 2.0–3.2 times those in Table 2, respectively. This suggests
that hydrogen separation also promotes pyrolysis of VM to tar and
steam gasification of char and tar to hydrogen, thereby inhibiting
pyrolysis of VM to hydrocarbon gases at higher reaction temperatures.30

Thus, CO2 sorption mainly promotes
hydrogen production because of tar from VM with the catalytic effects
of CaO, whereas hydrogen separation mainly promotes hydrogen production
from char.

Application of the Results
As previously mentioned,
the total H2 production amounts for subcritical steam gasification
without and with CaO in the absence of the hydrogen separation membrane
were 71 and 120 mL, respectively, whereas those without and with the
hydrogen separation membrane in the presence of CaO were 120 and 760
mL, respectively. Thus, the effect of hydrogen separation with CaO
on hydrogen production is higher than that of CO2 sorption
without the hydrogen separation membrane. There has been no report
focusing on the hydrogen production with both hydrogen separation
and CO2 sorption under the HyPr-RING conditions in the
previous studies.1−30 Therefore, the present work is useful for the efficiency of the
HyPr-RING process.

Conclusions
Adaro coal char gasification using subcritical
steam was carried out with/without CaO as a CO2 sorbent
and/or Pd-23% Ag as a hydrogen separation membrane in a batch/semibatch
autoclave reactor to investigate the kinetics in terms of the effect
of hydrogen separation at 590–650 °C and 1.9–2.4
MPa to investigate the application of the HyPr-RING method. The main
conclusions are as follows(1) CO2 sorption by CaO affects
the production rate of H2 but scarcely affected the carbon
conversion to gas.

(2) Hydrogen separation promotes the hydrogen production in spite of
the absence of CO2 sorption.

(3) The effect of hydrogen separation on hydrogen
yield and carbon conversion is higher than that of CO2 sorption.

(4) A higher gasification
temperature increases hydrogen yield and carbon conversion.

(5) Using a first-order reaction
form in parallel, the gasification reaction mechanism is explained
for the components of VM and char in coal char.

(6) A higher reaction temperature results
in an increase of the values of any kinetic constant for subcritical
steam gasification of Adaro coal char with/without CaO and/or a hydrogen
separation membrane.

(7) CO2 sorption promotes hydrogen production via tar from
volatiles with the catalytic effects of CaO, whereas hydrogen separation
promotes hydrogen production from char.



Experimental Section
Samples
An Adaro raw coal sample was reduced to a particle
size of 25–1000 μm. Here, the size of the particles of
the coal samples does not affect the hydrogen yield in the HyPr-RING
method.30 In this case, Adaro coal char
was made by raw Adaro coal devolatilization at six hundred degrees
centigrade for 2 h under the nitrogen atmosphere.28 The ultimate (dry ash-free basis) and proximate (accepted
basis) analyses of each coal sample (according to JIS M 8813 and 8812)
were carried out using a commercial automatic elemental analyzer (J-Science
Lab Micro Corder JM10) and thermogravimetric differential thermal
analyzer (TG–DTA; Shimadzu DTG-60), respectively, as shown
in Table 4. The higher
heating values of the Adaro raw coal and Adaro coal char estimated
from the ultimate analysis using Dulong’s formula43 were 31.7 and 26.7 MJ/kg, respectively. As a
CO2 sorbent, the commercially available EP grade CaO reagent
(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Japan) was used.

Experimental Apparatus
A laboratory-scale batch autoclave
reactor was used to investigate the subcritical steam gasification
of Adaro coal char with/without CaO in the absence of a hydrogen separation
membrane. Figure 10 shows the schematic diagram of the batch autoclave reactor, made
of SUS-316 (stainless steel) and used in the present study. The reactor
had a height of 10.6 cm, an outer diameter of 10.1 cm, and a volume
of 110 cm3. It was externally heated to a given temperature
using an electric furnace.

Figure 10 Schematic diagram of the laboratory-scale batch
autoclave reactor used in the present study.

A laboratory-scale semibatch autoclave reactor
was used to investigate the subcritical steam gasification of Adaro
coal char with/without CaO in the presence of a hydrogen separation
membrane. Figure 11 shows a schematic diagram of the semibatch autoclave reactor, made
of SUS-316 (stainless steel) and used in the present study. The reactor
had a volume of 110 cm3, a height of 10.6 cm, and an outer
diameter of 10.1 cm. A Pd-23% Ag metallic membrane, which was 50 mm
long with an outer diameter of 9.52 mm, inner diameter of 9.02 mm,
and surface area of 14.9 cm2, was used as a hydrogen separation
membrane in the reactor (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo, K.K., Japan). The
reactor was externally heated to a given temperature using an electric
furnace.

Figure 11 Schematic diagram of the laboratory-scale semibatch autoclave reactor
used in the present study.

Experimental Procedure
The batch or semibatch autoclave
reactor was loaded with a mixture of 0.307 g of Adaro coal char and
1.8 mL of distilled water, with or without 1.60 g of CaO prior to
being sealed, at room temperature around 25 °C in a nitrogen-purged
glovebox. The mixing mole ratios of CaO/coal char and H2O/coal char were 1.43 or 0 and 5.0 mol/molcarbon, respectively.

For subcritical steam gasification without the hydrogen separation
membrane, the batch reactor was heated to 590–650 degrees centigrade
within 35 min, and then held at this temperature for each desired
reaction time of 0.5–16.7 h for a reactor pressure of 1.9–2.4
MPa. After the desired reaction time, the reactor was cooled to room
temperature using an electric fan to quench the reaction. The gaseous
products were discharged from the reactor into a gas bag using a valve.
Using a commercially available GC-TCD (Shimadzu GC-2014; using MS-5A
and PPQ columns with the carrier gas of argon), the concentrations
of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
ethylene, and ethane were analyzed. The total amount of the produced
gas was estimated from the inner reactor volume, pressure, and temperature
after cooling.

For subcritical steam gasification with the hydrogen
separation membrane, the semibatch reactor was heated to 590–650
degrees centigrade within 35 min and then held in this temperature
range with the reactor pressure set at 1.9–2.4 MPa. Immediately
after heating, 500 mL/min of N2 gas was introduced to the
inside of the separation membrane as a sweep gas. The gas flow rate
and H2 concentration in the gas through the membrane were
analyzed every 10 min using a wet gas meter (Shinagawa W-NK-0.5A)
and the gas chromatograph, respectively. When H2 was no
longer detected in the gas, the reactor was cooled to room temperature
using an electric fan to quench the reaction. The gaseous products
were discharged from the reactor into a gas bag using a valve, followed
by analysis using the gas chromatograph. The amount of produced gas
that remained in the reactor after cooling was estimated from the
inner reactor volume, pressure, and temperature.
