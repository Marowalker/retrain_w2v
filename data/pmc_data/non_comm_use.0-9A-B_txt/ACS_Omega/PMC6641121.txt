In aluminum electrolysis cells, a
ledge of frozen electrolyte is
formed on the sides. Controlling the side ledge thickness (a few centimeters)
is essential to maintain a reasonable life span of the electrolysis
cell, as the ledge acts as a protective layer against chemical attacks
from the electrolyte bath used to dissolve alumina. The numerical
modeling of the side ledge thickness, by using, for example, finite
element analysis, requires some input data on the thermal transport
properties of the side ledge. Unfortunately, there is a severe lack
of experimental data, in particular, for the main constituent of the
side ledge, the cryolite (Na3AlF6). The aim
of this study is twofold. First, the thermal transport properties
of cryolite, not available in the literature, were measured experimentally.
Second, the experimental data were compared with previous theoretical
predictions based on first principle calculations. This was carried
out to evaluate the capability of first principle methods in predicting
the thermal transport properties of complex insulating materials.
The thermal diffusivity of a porous synthetic cryolite sample containing
0.9 wt % of alumina was measured over a wide range of temperature
(473–810 K), using the monotone heating method. Because of
limited computational resources, the first principle method can be
used only to determine the thermal properties of single crystals.
The dependence of thermal diffusivity of the Na3AlF6 + 0.9 wt % Al2O3 mixture on the microstructural
parameters is discussed. A simple analytical function describing both
thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of cryolite as a function
of temperature is proposed.

Introduction
In aluminum electrolysis cells, a molten
cryolite bath (80 wt %
Na3AlF6–12 wt % AlF3–5
wt % CaF2–2 wt % Al2O3) is
used to dissolve the alumina (Al2O3). The typical
working temperature of the cells lies between 5 and 10 K above the
cryolite bath liquidus temperature, which is ∼1233 K. As a
result, a ledge of frozen electrolyte melt is formed, attached to
its sides. From a purely industrial point of view, this side ledge
is fundamental for cost-effective electrolysis cells (long life and
reduced maintenance) as it acts as a protective layer to prevent erosion
and chemical attacks. Even though the side ledge thickness depends
on several factors (chemical composition of the electrolyte, ambient
temperature, cell voltage, cell current, feed cycle, frequency and
duration of anode effects, amount of alumina covering over the anodes,
metal tapping, and anode changes), the main limiting factor for its
numerical modeling is the lack of experimental data on thermal transport
properties. To alleviate this lack of data, we have carried out theoretical
studies to predict the thermodynamic and thermal transport properties
not only of cryolite but also of all compounds potentially present
in the side ledge. The theoretical approach used to predict the phase
properties is based on both classical and quantum methods. The thermal
conductivity was predicted using atomistic1−4 or classical equilibrium molecular
dynamics (EMD) calculations.5−9 The atomistic calculations were carried out through the density
functional theory (DFT), whereas the EMD used interatomic potential
parametrized also on a DFT basis. For the few compounds present in
the side ledge for which data were available (NaF, LiF, α-Al2O3, and CaF2), both classical and atomistic
methods have shown good predictive capability with an accuracy comparable
to the experimental error. In a recent study,10 the thermal conductivities of several side ledge samples extracted
from a postmortem industrial electrolysis cell have been measured
from 373 to 823 K via a laser flash method. The microstructure of
the samples, in terms of phase composition and microstructural parameters,
was found to depend on their position in the electrolysis cell. This
is especially true for the samples extracted from the bottom of the
cells, which showed a high porosity, above 35%. Then, the experimental
thermal conductivity measurements were compared with those predicted
using (i) the theoretical temperature-dependent thermal conductivity
of each phase, (ii) the effective medium theory model11 for the description of the phase assemblage model, and
(iii) a reliable porosity model that may be able to take into account
the critical behavior of the thermal conductivity at high porosity
(≥25%). For all samples, the predicted thermal conductivity
was found to be in very good agreement with that determined in the
experiment, for the entire range of temperature. This suggests the
good reliability of the theoretical temperature-dependent thermal
conductivity predictions of the phases potentially present in the
side ledge, obtained in our previous work.4,6 However,
given that cryolite is the main constituent of the side ledge, it
would also be interesting to obtain experimental information on its
thermal transport properties. From a theoretical point of view, such
information would be crucial when confirming the reliability of our
approach in predicting the lattice thermal conductivity of complex
compounds. If need be, the model could also be improved or corrected
by fine-tuning the parameters or by adding other contributions to
the thermal transport properties.

The aim of this work is to
experimentally determine the thermal
transport properties of cryolite up to the α → β
phase transition (836 K) to confirm or reject the previous theoretical
predictions obtained by combining EMD and DFT simulations. The experimental
results are discussed in terms of the dependence of both temperature
and microstructural parameters. Special attention is paid to the porosity
dependence. A simple expression for both thermal diffusivity and thermal
conductivity of the dense (i.e., zero porosity) cryolite as a function
of temperature is provided. The reliability of DFT methods in predicting
the thermal transport properties of complex electrically insulating
compounds is discussed.

Theoretical Modeling of the Thermal Diffusivity
as a Function
of Temperature and Porosity
A theoretical expression for
the thermal conductivity (K), heat capacity, and
density as a function of temperature
of the cryolite (α and β) and γ-alumina has been
formulated in our recent work.4 The approach
used to describe the lattice thermal conductivity is based on the
Callaway–Slack12,13 expression 1  where γ
and θD are
the Grüneisen parameter and the Debye temperature, respectively.
The constant A is equal to 6.51982 × 10–3 (kb/ℏ)3,13,14m̅ is
the average mass per atom, and δ3 represents the
average volume per atom. Last, n is the number of
atoms per primitive cell; this gives the crystallographic structure
dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity. The key parameters
describing the thermal conductivity, γ and θD, describe both the heat capacity and the thermal expansion, α
= −ρ–1 (∂ρ/∂T). The parameters in eq 1 were determined by combining DFT calculations, a modified
quasi-harmonic approximation theory, and thermodynamic optimization
when data are available. For cryolite, the model parameters describing eq 1 were obtained according
to a mixed method. First, γ and θD were calculated
by DFT and were adjusted to simultaneously reproduce the available
data on heat capacity and molar volume as a function of temperature.
For γ-alumina, a severe lack of experimental data on thermodynamic
(heat capacity) and volume properties (thermal expansion coefficient
and adiabatic bulk modulus) is observed. To alleviate this lack of
data, the model (eq 1) parameters were determined purely ab initio via DFT calculations.
More information about the modified quasi-harmonic approximation method
and the calculation procedure for the thermal conductivity model (eq 1) parameters can be found
in refs (2)(15), and (16). The parameters describing
the thermal conductivity, the heat capacity, and the density as a
function of temperature are reported in Table 1, obtained from the study by Gheribi and
Chartrand.4 The heat capacity at constant
pressure includes only the vibrational contribution; that is, the
defect contribution is neglected. The theoretical expression of CP as a function of temperature is given by15CP = CVD (1 + γαT), where CVD is the Debye heat capacity at constant
volume. Similarly to CP, the thermal expansion
can be expressed as a function of γ and θD.
However, for the reasons of clarity and reproducibility of the results,
the thermal expansion used the following empirical function: α(T) = α0 + α1T + α2/T + α3/T2. The coefficient set {α0,
α1, α2, α3} was
determined by a least-square fitting on the theoretical model. The
density was then expressed as , where ρ298 is the density
at 298 K. The theoretical lattice thermal diffusivity of a dense compound
(zero porosity) was then deduced from eq 1 according to the relationship 2

At low porosity (P), it has been shown in our
previous study10 that the thermal conductivity
of the side ledge microstructure decreases as (1 – P)2. Given that the heat capacity is independent
of the porosity and the density decreases as (1 – P), in this case, the thermal diffusivity decreases linearly with
the porosity. Above a certain porosity (typically above approximately
15%), the description of the thermal transport properties requires
reliable information on the microstructural parameters (type of microstructure,
grain size, grain size distribution, grain orientation, and chemical
composition of grain boundary) and their link with the porosity. In
the case of micropores, uniformly distributed, it has been shown that
the thermal conductivity displays a critical behavior.17−19 There is a drastic decrease beyond a certain critical porosity when
the probability of interconnection of pores becomes nonnegligible.
A critical behavior was also observed for the highly porous (P ≃ 35%) side ledge10 (the
cryolite is the main constituent of the side ledge). Nevertheless,
the present configuration is quite different. Indeed, the porosity
of the present cryolite sample is a macroporosity. In Figure 1, an optical image shows the
pore distribution and size. Clearly, the pores are of macroscale with
dimension lying between 0.5 to 2.5 mm.

Figure 1 Optical image of the
synthetic cryolite sample showing large macropores
with size lying between 0.5 to 2.5 mm. The size of the sample is 51
mm × 44 mm.

According to the kinetic
theory of phonons in solids, the lattice
thermal conductivity is expressed as ,
where C̃V, νg,
and lph. are the
heat capacity per unit volume, the phonon group velocity, and the
phonon mean free path, respectively. In the case of a small porosity
concentration, the modification of the phonon mean free path with
the pores can be expressed as lph.–1 = lph.,P=0–1 + lph.–P–1, where lph.,P=0 is the phonon mean free path at zero
porosity solid and lph.–P is the mean free path in the phonon-pore scattering. It can
be shown that lph.–P can be approximated by lph.–P ≃ RPP–1/3,20 where RP is the pore radius. This approximation leads
to the following expression for the lattice thermal conductivity as
a function of porosity20 3  

In the dense cryolite, the phonon mean free path is approximately
few nanometers (νg ≈ 3000 m·s–1 and CV ≈ 3 kB/atom)
and RP is approximately 1 mm. Thus, according
to eq 3 4  

The linearity of Klat. with the porosity
implies that the thermal diffusivity is independent of the porosity 5  

The linearity of the thermal
conductivity with the porosity is
not an unusual behavior for minerals. It has been shown that for a
large variety of oxides with large pores (thus with a small porosity
density), the thermal conductivity is well-described by a linear behavior21 up to 50% porosity.

The other microstructural
parameters that may affect the thermal
conductivity and the thermal diffusivity are the presence of the grain
boundaries and the types of phase assemblage. In the present case,
the system is almost pure cryolite. The effect of grain boundaries
upon the thermal transport results in the degradation of thermal conductivity
and thermal diffusivity. This degradation is proportional to the number
of grain–grain boundaries. Gheribi and Chartrand22 proposed a rather simple but an accurate theoretical
model predicting the thermal conductivity as a function of both temperature
and average grain size. In particular, a characteristic average grain
size (dmax), above which the thermal transport
properties can be considered identical to those of the corresponding
single crystal, was formulated. This value depends on key physical
parameters: θD, γ, νS, and n. Considering the parameters given in Table 1, this model22 leads to dmax ≈ 5 μm.
The average grain size observed for this sample is larger than 30
μm. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the thermal diffusivity
is independent of the grain size. In other words, the average number
of grain boundaries is too small to influence the thermal transport
within the sample. Last, to calculate the dependence of the thermal
diffusivity of the sample on the phase assemblage, we have considered
the Garnett-Maxwell mixture model11 and
a linear relationship between both the volume and the heat capacity
with alumina weight fraction. The Garnett-Maxwell model was chosen
because of its capability to describe the thermal transport of microstructures
consisting of a main matrix (cryolite) with a dilute inclusion (alumina).11

Results and Discussion
The measured
thermal diffusivity is based on the apparent thermal
diffusivity. The apparent thermal diffusivity is a sum of two contributions:
a conductive one and a radiative one. The “true” or
“physical” thermal diffusivity is the conductive thermal
diffusivity. It depends only on the material properties (ground state
electronic structure, phonon spectrum, crystallographic structure,
atomic masses, etc.) and physical and microstructural parameters (temperature,
porosity, grain size, grain boundaries, phase assemblage, etc.). The
so-called effective radiative contribution in a semitransparent medium
depends on extrinsic parameters such as sample size, optical properties
of the heater, outside radiation, and boundary conduction besides
its intrinsic optical properties. The effective radiative contribution
can also originate from parasitic electrical and/or thermal signals.
Although experimental apparatus can, in principle, directly measure
the true thermal diffusivity,23 most of
the time, the conductive thermal diffusivity is deduced from the apparent
thermal diffusivity by adding correction terms linked to the effective
radiative contribution.24−27 The corrective term is often treated empirically
because of a lack of accurate knowledge of the optical properties
of the heating sources or a possible parasitic signal. In the present
study, the separation of both the effective radiative and conductive
contributions from the apparent (total and measured) thermal diffusivity
was based on the traditional approach from the Stefan–Boltzmann
law. As both α-Na3AlF6 and γ-Al2O3 can be considered as electrically insulating
materials (the band gaps being 6.7 and 5.4 eV, respectively28), the conductive thermal diffusivity corresponds
to the lattice one and it is thus described by eq 2. The effective radiative thermal diffusivity
can be expressed as29 6  where σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann
constant (σ = 5.67 × 10–8 W/m2 K4) and n0 is the refractive
index of the medium. κR is the Rosseland absorption
coefficient, defined as ,29 where κ
is the spectral absorption coefficient and IBB is the blackbody spectral intensity in vacuo given by Planck’s
law. From a practical point of view, the determination of the effective
radiative contribution to the apparent thermal diffusivity required
accurate values for the optical properties of the heating sources
and the proportion of the parasitic signal. Instead, similar to most
of the studies using experimental apparatus measuring the apparent
thermal diffusivity,24−27,30 we opted for a semiempirical
approach to separate both the conductive and radial contributions
from the measured thermal diffusivity. The procedure is objective
and consists of fitting the experimental apparent thermal diffusivity
signal using the following expression 7  In these equations, both ψcond. and χrad. are two empirical constants
describing
the apparent thermal diffusivity. ψcond. is related
to the conductive contribution to the apparent thermal diffusivity,
whereas χrad. describes the effective radiative contribution.
Then, one can define the effective radiation-corrected thermal diffusivity
as aδ(rad.)* = aapp –
χrad.T3/(ρ·CP) and the pure conductive contribution as acond.* = ψcond./(T·ρ·CP).

The experimental apparent thermal
diffusivity (raw experimental
data) measured via MHM in the regular regime (above 473 K) is shown
in Figure 2 in comparison
with the fitted curve based on eq 7. The overall agreement is satisfactory with a maximum
deviation of less than 1%. This is significantly smaller than the
experimental error, estimated to be approximately 5%. The strongest
deviation is observed close to 800 K, where the experimental signal
shows a nonregular shape. The experimental measurements show that
the apparent thermal diffusivity decreases at temperatures up to 650
K, and then, a plateau is observed over a range of 100 K, after which
the thermal diffusivity starts to increase. This behavior with temperature
reflects the domination of the conductive contribution at a low temperature
(below approximately 650 K), followed by a region where the conductive
and effective radiative contributions are of similar magnitude. Next
is the domination of the effective radiative contribution. In Figure 3, the experimental
apparent thermal diffusivity is represented in the entire range of
temperature, that is, 300 K = T ≤ 810 K in
comparison with the theoretically predicted thermal diffusivity (eqs 1 and 2), both thermal diffusivity and the conductive terms being radiation-corrected.
The application of the Garnett-Maxwell mixture model shows that the
difference between the theoretical lattice thermal diffusivity of
pure α-Na3AlF6 and the α-Na3AlF6 + 0.9 wt % γ-Al2O3 mixture is not significant. We predict that addition of 0.9 wt %
of γ-Al2O3 in cryolite increases the thermal
diffusivity from 0.65% (at 300 K) to 1.1% (at 836 K). Given the discussion
above, the thermal diffusivity of the porous synthetic cryolite sample
can be assumed to be identical to that of the dense cryolite 8

effective radiation-corrected thermal conductivity (dashed double-dotted

diffusivity (dash-dotted line) and (iii) theoretical lattice thermal
diffusivity predicted ab initio by Gheribi and Chartrand4 (dashed line) via DFT calculations. The range
of temperature below and beyond the regular regime is identified by
a dashed vertical line on the figure.

In the regular regime, both the radiation-corrected thermal
diffusivity
and the conductive (true) thermal diffusivity deduced from the apparent
thermal diffusivity (raw experimental data) are in excellent agreement
with our previous DFT predictions4 at temperatures
up to 810 K, that is, very close to the α → β phase
transition temperature of cryolite. Note that the excellent agreement
found between DFT and the present MHM experiment results in some error
cancelation in the prediction of thermal conductivity, heat capacity,
and thermal expansion. The expected accuracy of the methodology used
to predict the thermal diffusivity is approximately ±15%.1,2,5,6 An
important point confirming the reliability of eq 7 in representing the different contributions
to the apparent thermal diffusivity is that the conductive term deduced
from the experimental apparent thermal diffusivity can be extrapolated
into the nonregular regime region. It is also in excellent agreement
with the DFT values at temperatures up to 300 K in contrast to the
radiation-corrected thermal diffusivity, which strongly diverges from
our prediction in the nonregular regime temperature range. This deviation
is consistent with the insignificance of the effective radiative contribution
to the apparent thermal diffusivity at low temperature. The semiempirical
treatment used in this work to separate the conductive (true) thermal
diffusivity from the apparatus measured one is thus reliable. The
recommended expressions for the thermal diffusivity and the thermal
conductivity of α-Na3AlF6 as a function
of temperature are those given by eqs 2 and 3, respectively, with the
parameters given in Table 1.

In the range of temperature 300 K ≤ T ≤
836 K, the recommended thermal transport properties of α-Na3AlF6 obtained in this study can be represented
in their simplest form as 9  and 10  

In a recent study,10 the thermal diffusivity
of several side ledge samples has been measured from 373 to 823 K
using the laser flash method. For two side ledge samples SL1 and SL2,
rich in α-cryolite (the exact compositions of these samples
are given in Table 2) with a porosity of 13%, we compare, in Figure 4, the experimental thermal diffusivity with
our recommended value of thermal diffusivity as a function of temperature
given by eq 10. The
difference between the thermal diffusivity of α-cryolite and
these two side ledge samples lies in the range from 20% to 35%. This
is primarily explained by the difference in the phase composition.
Indeed, both samples SL1 and SL2 contain approximately 18 wt % NaF
and α-alumina, with a thermal diffusivity 5 times greater1 than that of α-cryolite. It can be reasonably
assumed that, given the difference in phase composition, the present
experimental thermal diffusivity of α-cryolite obtained using
MHM is consistent with the experimental thermal diffusivity of the
side ledge rich in α-cryolite measured using the laser flash
method.

Conclusions
In
summary, in the present study, we have recorded a series of
MHM measurements to determine the apparent thermal diffusivity of
a porous α-Na3AlF6 + 0.9 wt % γ-Al2O3 mixture from 473 to 810 K. The thermal diffusivity
of this mixture is found to be almost identical to that of pure and
dense α-Na3AlF6. In addition to providing
a new set of experimental data for the temperature-dependent thermal
diffusivity of cryolite, which is not available in the literature,
the excellent agreement found between the experiments and the calculations
confirmed the reliability and the high accuracy of our DFT-based method4 in predicting the thermal transport properties
of various phases potentially present in the side ledge of an aluminum
electrolysis cell. This study is a good example proving that using
first principle calculations to compensate for a lack of data, when
carried out combining numerical calculations with physical principles,
can lead to very good predictions, even for systems with complex phases.
A positive outcome from our findings allows a partnership between
industry and theoretical research. This industrial application can
rely on accurate predictions, which is not always the case.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation and Characterization
The synthetic
cryolite sample produced by the company STACA31 was placed in a cylindrically shaped, grade NAC-673 graphite crucible
(fabricated by Graphite Machining) with a height of 28 cm and an internal
diameter of 9.8725 ± 0.0038 cm. The sample was melted in a laboratory-scale
Pyradia furnace to transform the granular material to a single solid
block. The crucible was protected by an Inconel shell and an argon
atmosphere during the heating process. Once the cryolite was completely
melted, three N-type thermocouples, each fixed at two points to a
homemade stainless steel structure, were inserted into the liquid.
The graphite crucible with the Inconel shell and the thermocouple-holding
structure, before the melting of the synthetic cryolite, is shown
in Figure 5. The holding
structure assured exact positions for the thermocouples. One thermocouple
(T1) was put at the center (rotational axes of the cylindrically shaped
sample), the second (T3) was close to the outer face, and the third
one (T2) was half way between T1 and T3. This arrangement resulted
in a distance of 4.826 cm between T1 and T3 and 2.459 cm between T1
and T2. All thermocouples were positioned 13 cm above the bottom of
the resolidified sample, which had a total height of 26 cm. Once the
cryolite was cooled to room temperature, it was removed from the graphite
crucible and transferred into a 1.54 mm thick stainless steel shell
for the thermal diffusivity measurement (see further).

Figure 5 View of the graphite
crucible with the Inconel shell and the thermocouple-holding
structure before the melting of the synthetic cryolite.

The purity of the sample was determined using X-ray
diffraction
(XRD). XRD analysis was carried out at room temperature (∼293
K), using a Panalytical X’Pert diffractometer, equipped with
copper tubes and a fast detector (PIXEL model). The XRD data were
then refined using the Rietveld method. The Rietveld method uses a
least-squares approach to refine a theoretical line profile (representing
the assumed compounds) until it matches the measured profile. More
details about this technique can be found in the work of Cox.32 The XRD analysis revealed that the sample contained
99.1 wt % α-cryolite (α-Na3AlF6)
crystallizing in a monoclinic structure (P21/n) and 0.9 wt % γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3) crystallizing in a tetragonal structure (Fd3̅m). The density of the sample
was measured at room temperature by weighing a sample cut to a cuboid
shape (51.9 ± 0.05 mm × 42.3 ± 0.1 mm × 44.1 ±
0.05 mm) with a SARTORIUS CPA 1003S balance of a precision of ±0.001
g. The measured mass was 187.965 g, resulting in a density of 1.941
± 0.04 g/cm3. The porosity of the sample was deduced
from the ratio between the experimental and theoretical density. The
theoretical density of the sample was calculated to be 2.892 g/cm3 by assuming additivity of the molar volumes (the densities
of Na3AlF6 and Al2O3 are
given in Table 1).
Thus, the theoretical porosity was estimated to be 32.9%. The porosity
was then assumed to be independent of temperature.

Thermal Diffusivity
Measurement
The MHM was used in
this work for the measurement of the thermal diffusivity. MHM is well-known
and well-documented.33 MHM assumes that
if the heating rate on a cylindrical solid surface is constant, after
an initial transient period, the heating rate inside of the solid
is homogeneously similar to what is found on the surface. In this
so-called regular regime of the second kind, the spatial temperature
distribution at subsequent stages of the heating remains similar;
it is only shifted upward. In principle, if the value of the heat
flux entering the sample is known, both the heat capacity at constant
pressure (CP) and the thermal diffusivity
(a) of the sample can be determined by measuring
the temperature histories between two points separated by a given
distance. The achievement of boundary conditions of the second kind
with a constant heat flux is, from a practical point of view, difficult
to ascertain. Instead, it is technically easier to impose a constant
heating rate on the surface using electrical heaters with a closed-loop
control. The thermal diffusivity is then defined from the temperature
histories according to the following relationship33,34 11  where D is the outer diameter
of the sample and t is the time of travel of an isotherm
from the outer surface to the center of the sample. MHM tests were
carried out in an apparatus developed at GRIPS-UQAC,34 under an argon atmosphere. No reference core was used;
consequently, CP could not be measured.
To ensure unidirectional heat flow in the radial direction, the height
of the sample was chosen to be more than 3 times its diameter. To
reduce end effects, a three-zone furnace was used. The central zone
was used to measure the thermal diffusivity, whereas the top and bottom
parts have the role of assuring the same temperature as that in the
central zone, using independently controlled heating elements. This
way, any temperature gradient in the axial direction is eliminated.
The top and the bottom of the furnace were insulated using refractory
bricks and wool. The external insulation of the furnace eliminated
the axial heat flux, and thus, only the radial heat transfer was maintained.
The optimal heating rate depends on the thermal diffusivity of the
sample and must be determined using preliminary tests. A heating rate
too slow or too rapid results in very small or very large temperature
differences between the surface and the center. This makes the evaluation
of the results possibly inaccurate. Furthermore, a heating rate that
is too low increases significantly the duration of the tests and the
argon consumption. MHM tests were carried out between 298 and 831
K with a heating rate of 1 K/min, which led to a radial temperature
difference of approximately 20 K between the center and the outer
face. Before the first test, the sample was heated to 573 K and cooled
to room temperature, to eliminate possible moisture content. In the
temperature range where the phase transition occurs, the heat release
associated with the transition makes the measurement of the thermal
diffusivity using MHM meaningless near this temperature. In the present
case, at approximately 836 K, cryolite undergoes a structural transformation
from monoclinic (α-Na3AlF6, space group: P21/n) to an elpasolite (cubic)
structure (β-Na3AlF6, space group: Fm3̅m).35 The thermal diffusivity of β-Na3AlF6 was thus not measurable using MHM. For this reason, we have limited
the temperature range to a few degrees below the theoretical α
→ β phase transition temperature.
