Spacers are widely
used in membrane technologies to reduce fouling
and concentration polarization. Fouling can start from the spacer
surface and grow, thereby reducing flux, selectivity, and operation
lifetime. Fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled bovine serum albumin
was used for fouling studies and observed during cross-flow filtration
operation for up to 144 h. Here, we mixed carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
and polypropylene (PP) to make a spacer with better antifouling than
plain PP spacers. The fouling process was observed by scanning electron
microscopy and monitored in situ by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular
dynamics simulations show that bovine serum albumin has a lower interaction
energy with the nanocomposite CNTs/PP spacer than with the plain PP.
The findings are relevant for the development of spacers to improve
the operation lifetime of membranes in filtration technologies.

Introduction
Membrane technology
for water desalination and reclamation is nowadays
the most frequently used method in industrial applications. This technology
includes reverse osmosis (RO), nano-, ultra-, and microfiltration
membranes, usually configured in spiral-wound membrane modules in
cross-flow setups. During operation, the service of membrane modules
is limited because of several phenomena, fouling being one of the
most important. Even though the antifouling properties of the membrane
surface are crucial for an efficient long-term operation of the modules,
the membrane surface is not the only part of the module prone to fouling.
Abundant research has been done toward the optimization of spacers,1−3 which have two main key functions within the membrane modules: separate
the membrane active layer sides while inducing a turbulent flow on
the surface of the active layer. The latter function is especially
important for avoiding the concentration polarization effect, which
occurs during the RO operation given the localized high concentration
of ions in the interface between the membrane active layer and the
solute. Turbulent flow also contributes to avoiding the deposition
of organic and inorganic matter on the membrane surface. Both concentration
polarization problems and fouling constitute an important problematic
phenomenon of membrane modules.

For these reasons, there are
potential advantages of a spacer with
enhanced antifouling properties. Previous research has explored several
alternatives, the most common being the modification of the geometric
configuration of the spacer. Such modifications alter the hydrodynamic
properties of the whole membrane module by changing the critical spacer
characteristics, such as the angle between filaments, filament thickness,
and spacing ratio.4−7 Some of these works reported the use of novel manufacturing methods
such as three-dimensional printing,5 which
are interesting and could open new possibilities for the spacer geometry
configuration but are still difficult to implement in large-scale
spacer manufacturing. Another route for improving the antifouling
properties of spacers is to directly modify their surface chemistry.
For instance, coating polypropylene (PP) spacers by sputtering with
metallic particles (silver, copper, and gold).3 Alternative approaches are the direct formation of silver nanoparticles,8,9 or a nanostructured zinc oxide10 on the
spacer surface, by attaching chelating ligands bound to metal ions,11 or antifouling biomolecules such as polydopamine.12 These examples illustrate the most common routes
to improve the biofouling resistance of the spacers in membrane modules,
all of them with a promising potential to reduce the biofilm deposition
and fouling. Nevertheless, from the manufacturing point of view, additional
steps in the preparation of spacers could hinder the practicality
of such an approach. Thus, the use of composite materials with intrinsic
antifouling properties as spacers would be advantageous.

In
recent years, considerable attention has been paid to low-fouling
materials that can be used in technologies such as biomedical materials,
food technology, and membrane and marine coatings.13 Low-density polyethylene such as vexar has been widely
used, but PP has also been used as spacer.14 PP is a low-cost commodity polymer with excellent mechanical properties
and good processability. Several studies have shown that both the
addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to certain polymers15 or modification of the surface chemistry of
spacers, particularly those made of polypropylene,11,16 can improve the antifouling properties. CNTs have been widely used
for making nanocomposite materials that exhibit superior properties,
such as increased mechanical and chemical resistance and combining
light weight and low cost. Furthermore, CNTs have been added to the
active layer of polyamide RO membranes with interesting results such
as better antifouling properties and increased chlorination resistance.17−21 A couple of years ago, we studied a nanocomposite active layer made
of CNTs and aromatic polyamide by conventional interfacial polymerization,17 with further research on its properties for
protein fouling and antiscaling resistance. We found through molecular
simulations that the initial stages of protein adhesion can be delayed
by increasing the molecular stiffness of the membrane molecule by
adding nanotubes while improving its hydrophilicity. Even though mechanisms
of fouling between spacers materials and membrane materials are different,
it is usually considered that improving their hydrophilicity is the
easiest way to reduce protein adsorption,16 and this is usually achieved by surface chemical modification. In
this work, however, we use a different method to modify the antifouling
property by the preparation of a general PP and multiwalled CNTs nanocomposite
spacer. The foulant adhesion behavior is compared with that of a conventional
PP spacer by examining its fouling resistance and proposing a possible
mechanism for the observed improvement in fouling resistance.

Results
and Discussion
Composite materials with carbon nanostructures
usually present
a quenching effect for many fluorescent substances, a property used
for their characterization or for novel sensor designs.22 This quenching has been attributed to strong
interactions between delocalized electrons in sp2 carbon
networks promoting charge transfer between dyes and carbon materials.
Since we used fluorescence microscopy, such a phenomenon would make
it impossible to monitor protein fouling; therefore, we first confirmed
that CNTs did not quench the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled
bovine serum albumin (BSA). Briefly, 0.1 mL of BSA (200 ppm)/FITC
solution containing fluorescent dye was poured on the spacers and
the intensity of the fluorescence was observed every hour for a maximum
of 24 h. The observed images using blue light (λex = 490 nm) are shown in Figure 1. It was confirmed that the fluorescent intensity did
not change from 2 h and up to 24 h, both for PP and CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacers, with only a slight uniform fluorescence weakening with
time, most likely due to photobleaching. Therefore, no quenching effect
was observed for the two spacer materials, which validates the usability
of the fluorescent dyeing method. We believe that the lack of quenching
indicates a good dispersion of CNTs on the PP matrix, resulting in
few CNTs being exposed on the nanocomposite surface, preventing direct
interactions between the dyes and the surface of CNTs, in turn, avoiding
the dye fluorescence quenching. Additional images are shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S1), where
a relationship between BSA concentration (100 to 400 ppm) and observed
fluorescence intensity can be observed for both pure PP and CNTs/PP-based
nanocomposite spacer samples.

fluorescence in plain
PP and 15% CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers (organic foulant: FITC-BSA).
Images correspond to optical (a, c) and fluorescence microscopy (b,
d) images with time for the droplet on the spacer, respectively (FITC-BSA
solution: 8 μL).

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of PP and various CNTs/PP
nanocomposite feed spacers before and 144 h after BSA fouling test
are shown in Figure 2, along with the corresponding optical and fluorescence images of
the spacers inside the cross-flow experimental cell. The BSA-originated
deposits are observed for all the spacers. However, the absence of
fluorescence suggests that no protein was deposited on the spacers
when CNTs were added to the plain PP, even in small quantity. This
result contrasts with the previous findings in polyamide CNTs nanocomposite
membranes in which at least 10 wt % CNTs were necessary to improve
the antifouling properties.18,19 In the following experiments,
we focused mainly on the CNTs/PP nanocomposite spacer containing 15
wt % CNTs (hereafter designated as 15 wt % CNTs/PP) and the BSA-fouling
tests.

Figure 2 SEM, optical, and fluorescence images of the surfaces of PP and
different CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers before and after 144
h of BSA fouling test. Arrows indicate the spacer thread main axis.

Figure 3 shows the
fluorescence microscopy images taken every 24 h of the spacers placed
on commercial RO membranes after immersing in the foulant solution
for up to 144 h. A weak fluorescence signal was observed for the PP
and CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers at the beginning of the experiment.
The photographs show that the deposition of foulant on PP increased
with time. On the contrary, the deposition amount of foulant on CNTs/PP
is significantly less than that for PP regardless of the content of
CNTs. Furthermore, the deposition does not increase with time. The
central area of the RO membrane surrounded by the CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacer has the deposition of the foulant, in contrast to the
CNTs/PP filament. These images show that the CNTs/PP nanocomposite
spacer has an outstanding antifouling functionality against BSA.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescence
microscopy images of PP and CNTs/PP nanocomposite
spacers observed in the cross-flow fouling test using organic foulant
(BSA) stained by FITC with time. (b) Intensity of the fluorescence
from the spacer surface are plotted for each spacer as a function
of fouling time.

As reported before,23 the foulant first
deposit in the gap between the spacer and the membrane or accumulates
in the vicinity and upper surface of the spacer, and then those protein
deposits extend to the remaining free membrane surface. However, in
the case of the CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacer, the extension of
the foulant accumulated in the vicinity of the filament toward the
membrane surface occurred far less than that in the case of the PP
spacer, and the deposition of the foulant on the spacer filament was
rare. The observation suggests that no deposition of the foulant occurs
on the surface of the CNTs/PP filament. Therefore, it can be considered
that the deposition of the foulant develops from the closing portion
of the water flow. The accumulation of the foulant on the CNTs/PP
spacer correlates with the water flow in the narrow portion between
the membrane and the feed spacer, where the water flow is expected
to be much lower.

To confirm the influence of the RO membrane
on the fouling of the
spacers, optical and fluorescence images of the surfaces of the PP
and 15 wt % CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers without the membrane
were observed and are shown in Figure S2. The result is the same as the fluorescence images in Figure 3, confirming that RO membranes
do not promote the fouling behavior of the spacers, although some
material is deposited in the gap between the spacer and the membrane
in all cases.

Figure 4 shows the
observed ζ-potential (two measurements for each sample) of the
feed spacers (plain PP, 5, 10, and 15 wt % CNTs/PP); all the specimens
are negatively charged at pH above 4. There is a trend of slight increase
in the ζ-potential of the spacer with the content of CNTs. It
is well-known that the ζ-potential can influence the absorption
of foulants electrostatic interactions dominate. BSA has a isoelectric
point between 4.6 and 5.1, thus it is negatively charged under desalination
conditions, i.e., pH between 7 and 8.5. Negatively charged substrates
thus have a larger electrostatic repulsion toward BSA, which increases
with their negative charge. However, in the presence of salts, the
adhesion of BSA toward polymeric substrates is dominated by hydrophobic
interactions because the ions screen the charge interactions.24

Figure 4 ζ-Potential of various feed spacers (plain PP, 5,
10, and
15 wt % CNTs/PP) measured (each 2 points) as a function of pH.

We also carried out molecular dynamics simulations
to study the
fouling phenomena on PP. Typically, a BSA molecule was equilibrated
on the surface of a plain PP or CNTs/PP model. After 0.5 ns of simulation,
the contact surface between PP and BSA (Figure 5a) is considerably larger than that between
CNTs/PP-BSA (Figure 5a); this trend increases over time, as shown in Figure 5c. This difference in adsorption
originates from the difference in the interaction energy between CNTs/PP-BSA
(Figure 5d, black dotted
lines) and PP-BSA (Figure 5d, red dotted lines), which is slightly lower in the former.
In addition, it is well-known that surface-bound water also plays
a role in preventing protein adsorption. The same plot shows that
the interaction energy between CNTs/PP and water (Figure 5d, solid black line) is stronger
than that between PP and water (Figure 5d, solid red line), while the interaction energy between
PP and BSA is lower than that between PP and water. Indeed, Figure 5e shows that plain
PP has a slightly thinner surface-bound water layer on the surface
compared with CNTs/PP (Figure 5f).

models. (c) Contact surface area evolution between BSA and the two
spacer models. (d) Interaction energies between PP and CNTs/PP and
water (solid lines) and PP and CNTs/PP and BSA (dotted lines). Visualization

In addition to the effect of interaction energy,
the surface morphology
should be considered as the reason why the present CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacer shows a higher resistance for fouling deposition in comparison
with the typical PP-based spacer. Figure S3 shows the laser scanning microscopy images of the surfaces of (a)
PP and (b) 15 wt % CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers. The latter
has a smoother surface on which BSA molecules are harder to be anchored.
The relatively low degree of interactions between BSA and PP might
be a reason why BSA is not attached to the CNTs/PP surface despite
a small increase in the contact angle, as shown in Figure S4. Indeed, usually polyolefins with a larger contact
angle show a higher propensity for BSA fouling; however, in this study,
the CNTs/PA mixture does not follow that trend. We believe the mechanism
is thus dominated by a relatively inert substrate with a reduced roughness
that prevents protein adsorption along with a lower interaction of
the CNTs/PP matrix with the BSA molecule.

Conclusions
We
have successively developed a feed spacer using a CNTs/PP nanocomposite
with organic antifouling properties. The present CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacer shows a high resistance for fouling deposition in comparison
with the typical PP-based spacer currently used, which is evaluated
by the fouling test for organic matter: BSA foulant under cross-flow
experimental setup with RO membrane. This excellent antifouling property
of CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacer against the commercially used
and laboratory made PP-based spacers can be attributed to the smooth
morphology and weak negatively charged properties compared to the
typical PP feed spacers. The fouling resistance of the CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacer is expected to reduce the pressure loss by foulant deposition,
improving the overall membrane module performance. Our proposed nanocomposite
spacer exhibits promising characteristics, which make it feasible
for efficient membrane modules in various water treatment operations
ranging from seawater desalination to groundwater, industrial water,
and sewage, which contain considerable amounts of foulants and impurities.
In addition, this feed spacer could be attractive for applications
in the field of membrane technology related to biological, pharmaceutical,
and food processing.

Experimental Section
CNTs/PP Nanocomposite Spacer
Fabrication
Composite
feed spacers are usually made by rotary extrusion; however, we studied
laboratory-made samples fabricated by injection molding (Sodick Co.,
Ltd., TR60EH) using a batch of PP (Japan Polypropylene Corporation,
J137M, melt flow rate 30 g/10 min, density 0.9 g/cm3, Rockwell
hardness 115, heat deflection temperature 125 °C, room temperature
charpy impact strength 2.5 kJ/m2, yield stress 42 MPa,
modulus of elasticity 2.3 MPa) with CNTs (CNano Technology, FloTube9000)
in ratios between 5.0 and 15.0 wt %. Details of the CNTs/PP blend
preparation are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S5). The nanocomposites for the spacers
were prepared using a CNTs/PP masterbatch (CNano Technology, CP360-20),
and injection-molded into circular samples (33 mm in diameter) with
and without CNTs (black and white samples shown in Figure 6a, respectively). The optical
microscopy images of the dimensions for the spacer are shown in Figure 6b,c and those of
the fracture surfaces are shown in Figure 6d,e, while the optical images and profilometries
of the surface are shown in Figure 6f–i.

of the (j) plain PP spacer and (k) 15 wt % CNTs/PP spacer. The insets
show the two-dimensional (2D) scattering pattern, where a clear biaxial
orientation can be seen.

Figure 6j,k shows
the wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns obtained for the plain
polypropylene material and the carbon nanotube nanocomposite containing
15 wt % CNTs. We observed a higher scattering in the nanocomposite
due to the highly ordered CNTs material embedded in the nanocomposite
and an apparent increment in crystallinity. The peak-to-peak ratio
of the crystalline peaks to the amorphous phase halo area increases
after adding the CNTs, suggesting a nucleating effect. The (001) peak
of graphitic carbon is absent due to the perpendicular orientation
of the nanotubes to the beam, so it might be very weak and/or overlapped
by the polymer peaks. However, the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
patterns (Supporting Information, Figure S6) evidence a dramatic reduction of the spherulite size upon addition
of the CNTs. The WAXS patterns before integrations show a clear biaxial
orientation due to the orientation of the polymer during the injection
flow. This orientation effect is markedly higher in the CNTs/PP composites.
Indeed, the CNTs have been shown to induce polymer orientation during
injection due to shear stress,21 improving
the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. Molecular dynamics
simulations in Figure S7 show how PP is
well-attached to the walls of CNTs (Figure S7a) and has a lower mobility due to the good interaction and charge
transfer with the nanotubes, thus the mobility map shows as a gradient
from the bottom to the top, with the PP being closer to the CNTs showing
a lower diffusion. Bulk PP on the other hand has a relatively homogeneous
mobility (Figure S7b). These results show
that carbon nanotubes are well-dispersed and well-aligned within the
polypropylene matrix and support a possible improvement in the mechanical
properties.

Figure 7a shows
the Raman spectra of PP and various CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed spacers,
and the typical carbon signature peaks denoted as D and G peaks are
clearly observed. The relationship between the CNT content and peak
intensity ratios against PP original peak at 2900 cm–1 (denoted as D/PP and G/PP) shows a linear characteristic with the
threshold at about 4 wt % CNT content (Figure 7b). It is shown that the CNTs are well-dispersed
in the nanocomposite, and the Raman spectroscopy is useful for the
determination of the CNT content in the CNTs/PP nanocomposite feed
spacer by using the D or G peaks from carbon divided by the signal
of PP at 2800 cm–1 as the calibration curve.

Cross-Flow Tests of Organic
and Inorganic Fouling of the Feed
Spacers
Figure 8a shows the optical microscopy image of the prepared CNTs/PP nanocomposite
feed spacer. The PP and CNTs/PP feed spacers and permeate spacer (Figure 8b) samples were placed
in transparent cross-flow cells as shown in Figure 8c. The solutes were a mixture of 0.06 wt
% NaCl (Kanto Chemical Co., Inc., 37144-01) aqueous solution plus
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories,
IgG-Free and protease-free, 001-000-162). Fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., 349-03661) was used
to label the BSA as a fluorescent organic foulant. The schematic illustration
of the experimental system is shown in Figure 8d. A cross-flow filtration system (Membrane
Solutions Technology, Tokyo, FTU-1) was operated at 0.7 MPa with a
flow rate of 500 mL/min through the cross-flow cell. The 1 mm thick
feed spacers were placed on the membrane’s surface to replicate
a typical large-scale RO module. The water flow rate was 500 mL/min
along the surface of the membrane. The water source temperature was
kept at 21 ± 1 °C. A 0.06 wt % NaCl aqueous solution was
used for the initial compaction process for 72 h, until reaching a
stable permeate flux. The NaCl rejection, permeate flux, and salt
permeability were measured on the commercial RO membrane during compaction,
whereas during the steady state of the fouling experiments, the permeate
flux was recorded.

feed spacer,
(b) permeate collector spacer, (c) acrylic transparent cell, and (d)
cross-flow fouling tests system of the spacers using fluorescence
microscope for in situ observation.

At first, 100 ppm of the FITC-BSA solution as an organic foulant
was dissolved in 0.06 wt % NaCl aqueous solution after the membrane
compaction was completed in the cross-flow test at pH 7. The fouling
tests were conducted at pH 10. The BSA deposition on the membrane
surface and spacers was monitored by blue light (λex = 490 nm) fluorescent optical microscopy. The camera used was a
CMOS microscope digital eyepiece camera (MC500, Ostec, Guanzhou, China)
with an exposure time of 196 ms and equipped with an epifluorescence
mode using a stereomicroscope (SMZ18, Nikon, Tokyo) with a Nikon P2-EFLC
green filter. The surface of the membrane was monitored through the
CNTs/PP feed spacer at the center of the acrylic cross-flow cell every
24 h over the 144 h fouling period.

Spacer Characterization
Samples surface and cross sections
were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi, Ltd.,
SU-8000) before and after cross-flow fouling tests. The samples were
coated with Au to avoid charging during the SEM observation. Biofouling
evaluations were also carried out by means of the fluorescent dyeing
of BSA by FITC, as described above. Additional structural characterization
was done by melting–mixing PP and CNTs in different mass fractions.
Then, net-like samples with a shape typical of a membrane spacer were
injected. Samples of about 1 mm of radius were cut from this material
and analyzed by WAXS and SAXS, at the Aichi Synchrotron facility,
using the BL8 line. The resulting diffraction patterns were analyzed
using Fit2D software.25

Molecular Dynamics
Computer simulations were done by
running classical molecular dynamics using LAMMPS simulation package.26 For the CNTs/PP nanocomposite structure modeling,
we used three layers of graphene and PP, which is a good approach
for evaluating experimental interactions between PP and CNTs walls.
One hundred chains of PP were relaxed to conform a block representing
the bulk PP. To avoid coalescing into spherical aggregates, spring-like
points were added to selected PP atoms. For both PP and grafted polypropylene
(GPP) models, atom charges were set by using a charge equilibration
method.27,28 The molecular structure of BSA was extracted
from the PDB file downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (4F5S). We used the General
Amber Force Field29 for PP and CNTs/PP,
and CHARMM force field30 for BSA. The SPC/E
model was adopted for water molecules.31 The interaction between molecules was calculated by Lennard-Jones
and Coulombic interactions with a particle–particle mesh solver.32 The interaction of water layer with PP was calculated
considering the water molecules within 4 Å from the PP surface.
All calculations were performed by using NPT ensemble at 1 atm and
at 300 K with the Nosé–Hoover method33 under periodic boundary conditions with a time step of
1 fs.
