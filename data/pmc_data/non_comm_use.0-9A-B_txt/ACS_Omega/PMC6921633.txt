The strategy to remove the lone pairs of ligands combined
with
the bonding similarity between Li and Al have been utilized to design
new planar tetracoordinate carbon (ptC) species C2v CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE based on ptC global minima CAl3E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi)
clusters. The explorations of potential energy surfaces and high-level
CCSD(T) calculations indicate that these planar tetracoordinate carbon
(ptC) species with 16 and 14 valence electrons (ve) are the global
minima except for CLiAl2P. Bonding analyses reveal that
there is one π and three σ bonds between C and ligands,
one delocalized σ bond between the peripheral ligands, and three/two
lone pairs for CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As,
Sb, Bi). Especially, the C=E double bonds are crucial for the
stabilities of these ptC clusters. The ptC core is governed by 2π
+ 6σ bonding, which conforms to the 8-electron counting. Born–Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations reveal that CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) clusters are robust
against isomerization and decomposition. The results obtained in this
work complete the series of ptC CLinAl3–nE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0–3) systems and 18ve, 16ve, 14ve, and 12ve counting.

1 Introduction
Planar tetracoordinate
carbon (ptC) structure was first put forward
in a transition state in 1968 by Monkhrost.1 Two years later, based on analyzing the electronic structure
of planar methane, Hoffmann and co-workers creatively proposed strategies
to stabilize ptC structure.2 In 1976, Schleyer
and Pople computationally characterized the first ptC molecule 1,1-dilithiumcyclopropane
(C3H3Li2).3 Since then, considerable and continuous efforts have been devoted
to design, prediction, and production of planar tetra-, penta-, hexa-,
and heptacoordinate carbon (ptC, ppC, phC, and p7C) species4−9 for decades, due to their unusual structures, peculiar bonding properties,
and potential application prospect. Several ptC clusters including
NaAl4C–, CAl3Si–, CAl3Ge–, and CAl4H– have been observed in the gas photoelectron spectroscopy
(PES) experiments,10−12 which are isoelectronic with previously reported cis-CSi2Al2 and trans-CSi2Al2 by Schleyer and Boldyrev.

Two
strategies including “electronic” and “mechanical”,
can be used to stabilize the ptC species. The mechanical approach
employs the solely steric forces (small-ring strain and/or an annulene
perimeter or cylindrical cage or tube) to stabilize the ptCs.2,4−8 Compared with mechanical strategy, electronic strategy has the merit
of being uncomplicated and easily applicable. Based on CSi2Al2, CSi2Ga2, and CGe2Al2, Schleyer, Boldyrev, and Simons proposed that the
presence of 18 valence electrons (ve) is crucial for favoring ptC
over corresponding tetrahedral structures.13,14 As an important rule not a law, 18ve counting is a nice building
way to suggest the new ptC/ppC species, both in computational designs
and gas-phase experimental works, as exemplified by a series of CAl42–,10−16 CAl5+,17−21 and CBe54−25 based clusters. As proposed by Keese,6 the electron counting rule for planar hypercoordinate carbons may
depend strongly on the chemical surrounding. Actually, to date, ptC
structures with fewer than 18 valence electrons are rarely studied.
It should be noted that ptC CAl4– and
CAl3E (E = Si, Ge) with 17ve were observed in photoelectron
spectroscopy experiment by Wang as early as 1999.11,26 In 2018, 16ve CBe4Au4 with a quasi-ptC was
theoretically predicted by us.27 Using
the ionic strategy, Ding and co-workers designed the first pentaatomic
ptC species CAl3Tl with 16ve.28 15ve ptC-CB4+ was also predicted as the global
minimum.29 14ve ptC species CSi2H2 and CGe2H2 were only the local
minima on the potential energy surfaces.30 In 2015, 12ve CLi3E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) and CLi3E+ (E = O, S, Se, Te, Po) were reported as the ptC species.31 These findings continue to challenge the 18ve
counting of ptC species. Thus, 18ve counting is by no means a prerequisite
for the ptC species.

Usually, the electrons of ptC species are
used to form the C–ligand
(C–L) bonding, ligand–ligand (L–L) bonding, and
the lone pairs (LPs) of ligands. The LPs of ligands seem less important
for the stability of ptC, compared with the first two kinds of bonding.
Some of LPs may be removed to change the electrons of the whole ptC
system. Can we design the new ptC species by removing the LPs of ligands?
The answer seems to be yes. Based on the similarity between Li and
Al, we herein design and characterize the ptC species C2v CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) with 16ve and 14ve, respectively. To our
knowledge, CLiAl2E are the third series of 16ve ptC GMs,
while CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) are the first series
of ptC GMs with 14ve. The current results complete the series of ptC
CLinAl3–nE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0–3) systems
with 18ve, 16ve, 14ve, and 12ve counting.

2 Computational Methods
Global minimum
(GM) structural searches were performed for CLiAl2E and
CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb and Bi) clusters,
using the coalescence kick (CK)32−34 algorithm at the B3LYP35,36 /Lanl2DZ level. More than 2000 stationary points were probed for
each cluster (1000 singlets vs 1000 triplets). The top low-lying isomers
were then fully optimized using the B3LYP approach and the aug-cc-pVTZ
basis set (aug-cc-pVTZ-pp for Sb and Bi).37,38 Vibrational frequencies were calculated at the same level to ensure
that the reported structures are true minima on the potential energy
surfaces. Single point CCSD(T)39,40 calculations were performed
for the global minima and three low-lying isomers of CLi2AlE and CLiAl2E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) cluster geometries
to further evaluate their relative energies. Natural bond orbital
(NBO)35 analyses were performed at B3LYP/C,
Li, Al, P, As/aug-cc-pVTZ/Sb, and Bi/aug-cc-pVTZ-pp level to obtain
Wiberg bond indices (WBIs) and natural atomic charges. Chemical bonding
was elucidated via canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) and adaptive
natural density partitioning (AdNDP).41 Nucleus independent chemical shifts42 and isochemical shielding surfaces43 in
the Z direction (NICSzz and ICSSzz) were calculated to assess
π/σ aromaticity for these ptC species. Orbital compositions
were analyzed using the Multiwfn program.44 All electronic structure calculations were done using the Gaussian
09 package.45 Molecular structures, CMOs,
isochemical shielding surface (ICSS), and AdNDP bonding patterns were
visualized using the CYLview,46 Multiwfn,44 and GaussView 5.047 programs.

3 Results
3.1 Design of CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi)
Scheme 1 shows that the strategy to design CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi). CAl42– (D4h) has been regarded as the prototype of 18ve ptC. Based on the isoelectronic
relationship between Al2– and E, 18ve ptC-CAl3E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) were designed by Ding and Merino in
2015, which are the global minima on the potential energy surfaces.
Using three Li atoms to replace three Al atoms of 18ve CAl3E, 12ve ptC-CLi3E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) can be formed. The
structures of CAl3E (18ve) and CLi3E (12ve)
are similar, with the central ptC and three periphery Al/Li. In other
words, each Al atom in CAl3E can be replaced by Li atom.
In fact, only one electron of Al atom is used for the bonding in these
species, because two valence electrons are used to form the LP. Thus,
there is little effect on the stability to remove the LPs of metal
ligands for these ptC clusters. Replacing one/two Al atom(s) with
Li in 18ve ptC-CAl3E, the 16ve ptC-CLi2AlE and
14ve ptC-CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) can be designed. Thus,
18ve ptC-CAl3E, 16ve ptC-CLiAl2E, 14ve CLi2AlE, and 12ve CLi3E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) formed
a perfect ptC-CLinAl3–nE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi; n = 0–3)
systems. There are two types of Al atoms in CAl3E: one
is bridging Al (adjacent with E atom) and the other is terminal Al.
If one Al atom of CAl3E is being replaced with Li atom,
our calculations indicate that the terminal Al atom prefers to be
replaced (except for E = P). In contrast, if two Al atoms of CAl3E are being replaced, the bridging Al atoms possess high preference.
However, there are still some questions to be answered. Are 16ve ptC-CLi2AlE and 14ve ptC-CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) global
minima on the potential energy surfaces? Are they dynamically stable?
What are their bonding properties? Are they aromatic? We will answer
these questions in the following discussion.

16ve-CLiAl2E and 14ve-CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb,
Bi)
3.2 Planar Tetracoordinate Cabon (ptC) CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) Clusters
The extensive computational structural searches of the potential
energy surface and high-level ab initio calculations suggest that
each global minimum of CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E
= P, As, Sb, Bi) has a ptC in the center. The optimized structures
of GMs 1–8 (except for 1) along with their bond distances are illustrated in Figure 1. Three low-lying isomers are
also depictured in Figure S1 (Supporting
Information) for comparison. As shown in Figures 1 and S1, 1–8 possess the perfectly C2v planar structures, with the central
ptC and two periphery symmetric Al/Li ligands. 16ve ptC-GMs 2–4 are 0.74, 2.91, and 3.39 kcal·mol–1 more stable than their closest competitors at the
single point CCSD(T) level, while 1 is the second lowest
structure, being 0.15 kcal·mol–1 higher in
energy than 1b. The relative energy (ΔE) of
bridging Li vs terminal Li structures of the CLiAl2E (E
= P, As, Sb, Bi) series is shown in Figure 2. From P to Bi, the geometric radius increases
gradually in the order 1.07 < 1.19 < 1.39 < 1.48 Å,48 while the electronegativity decreases in the
order 2.19 > 2.18 > 2.05 > 2.02. The relatively small geometric
radius
and large electronegativity make P atom possible to share Li with
the C atom. 5–8 are the GMs of the
CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) with 14ve, which are 4.91,
6.52, 6.26, and 5.90 kcal·mol–1 more stable
than their second isomers at the single point CCSD(T) level. It should
be noted that the second lowest isomers of CLiAl2E and
CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) can be obtained by exchanging
positions of Al and Li in 1–8, which
also are ptC species with Cs symmetry.

a reference.

The bond distances, Wiberg bond indices (WBIs),
and natural atomic
charges can help us to explore the bonding characters of 1–8, which are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. The stabilities of ptC benefit from C–ligand
and ligand–ligand bonding. The C–ligand bonding includes
C–E, C–Al, and C–Li bonding, while ligand–ligand
bonding includes E–Al, E–Li, and Al–Li bonding
in 1–8. With the increase in the
size of E atoms, the changes of the corresponding bond distances have
the almost same trends. The C–E bond distances in 1–8, in turn, are 1.71, 1.85, 2.07, 2.18, 1.69,
1.82, 2.05, and 2.16 Å, which are close to the C=E double
bond lengths (1.69, 1.82, 2.04, and 2.15 Å for E = P, As, Sb,
Bi).49 The WBIC–E are
in the range of 1.54–1.92 in 1–8, which is consistent with the conclusions from the analyses of bond
distances. Thus, there is the C=E double bond in 1–8, respectively. It should be noted that the
C–E bonding gradually decreased, with the electronegativity
of E atom gradually increasing in these ptC species. For reference,
a single C–Al bond has an upper bound of 2.01 Å and that
of C–Li is 2.08 Å, based on the covalent atomic radii.
The C–Al bond distances are in the range of 2.01–2.06
Å in 1–4, being close to the
single bond length. The C–Al bonding in 5–8 are strong than that of 1–4, as the C–Al bond distances (from 1.90 to 1.94 Å). The
WBIC–Al are in the range of 0.42–0.49 in 1–4, indicating that the C–Al bonding
is close to half of the covalent single bond, while that of 5–8 are from 0.73 to 0.79, being close
to a covalent single bond. The C–Li bond distances are from
1.90 to 2.00 Å in 1–8. There
is a little covalent bonding between C and Li in 1–8, due to the large differences in their electronegativity.
The E–Al bond distances are from 2.47 to 2.89 Å in 1–4, while the E–Li bond distances
are from 2.33 to 2.70 Å in 5–8. The WBIE–Al in 1–4 and WBIE–Li in 5–8 are in the range of 0.43–0.47 and 0.30–0.33, respectively,
suggesting that there are partial covalent bonding between them. The
long distances between terminal Al/Li atoms and the bridging Li/Al,
indicate that there are weak bonding between them. The WBIAl–Li(terminal) of 1–4 are only 0.10–0.16
and WBILi–Al (terminal) of 5–8 are only 0.09–0.10, respectively.

The mixed covalent/ionic nature of C–Al, C–E,
C–Li,
E–Al, E–Li, and Al–Li bonding, as also reflected
from the NBO charges. As shown in Table 1, the central ptCs in 1–8 carry the negative charges (−1.83 to −2.10
|e|). There are obvious electron transfer from the Al and Li atoms
to C. E atoms carry a small amount of positive charges in 1–4 (0.03–0.38 |e|) and 7, 8 (0.13 |e|), while that of 5 and 6 carry a little negative charges (−0.01 and −0.05 |e|).
Al atoms carry 0.50–0.60 |e| positive charges, while Li atoms
carry 0.68–0.80 |e| positive charges. The positive charges
of terminal Al/Li are more than that of the bridging Al/Li atoms in
these ptC species. These C–ligand and ligand–ligand
bonding together contribute to the stabilities of these ptC species.
In addition, the relatively large HOMO–LUMO (gaps) (2.62, 2.32,
1.91, and 1.74 eV) further support the stabilities of 1–8. Notably, it decreases gradually from E =
P to Bi, implying a decrease in stability according to the principle
of maximum hardness.

3.3 Molecular Dynamics
The kinetic stability
is equally important for the experimental realization. Born–Oppenheimer
molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations were performed at B3LYP/C, Al,
Li, P, As/6-31G(d)/Sb, and Bi/Lanl2DZ level for 50 ps at room temperature
(298 K) to investigate the dynamic stabilities of 1–8. The kinetic stability can be evaluated by examining the
structural evolution during the simulation, which is measured by the
root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). As shown in Figure S2, the average RMSDs of 1–8 are in the range of 0.15–0.22 Å, indicating
they possess good kinetic stabilities.

4 Discussion
4.1 Chemical Bonding in CLiAl2E and
CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) Clusters
Why are these
16ve and 14ve ptC clusters stable? To understand the bonding nature
of CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb, Bi),
molecular orbital analyses were performed, aided with orbital composition
calculations. The valence canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) of 1 and 5 are plotted in Figure 3. The valence CMOs of 2, 3, 4 and 6, 7, 8 have the same patterns with 1 and 5, respectively. For clarity, here, only the valence CMOs of 1 and 5 will be discussed. As shown in Figure 3a, eight occupied
CMOs of 1 can be divided into four subsystems: (i) Subset
1 has three CMOs: HOMO, HOMO – 2, and HOMO – 6, which
are largely Al/P s based and can be readily located as three 1c–2e
lone pairs; (ii) Subset 2 is a π framework and involve only
the HOMO – 3, which is primarily on the CAl2P core;
(iii) Subset 3 is a σ sextet (including HOMO – 4, HOMO
– 5, and HOMO – 7), which is delocalized with components
from C center; (iv) Subset 4 is σ delocalized subsystem (including
only the HOMO – 1), which is primarily on the peripheral LiAl2P ring (the contribution of C in HOMO – 1 is only 9%).
One π and three σ bonds around ptC center, in combination
with one periphery Al–P–Al–Li delocalized bonds
can make ptC CLiAl2P stable. The CMOs of 5 are basically similar to 1, except for one LP of Al,
which also has three π and σ subsystems. It has little
impact on the bonding properties to replace one Al atom with one Li
atom in 16ve CLiAl2P. Thus, both 16ve CLiAl2P and 14ve CLi2AlP have three π and σ subsystems
(2π, 6σ, and 2σ). If these bondings are all delocalized,
the 2π, 6σ, and 2σ electron counting conform to
the Hückel (4n + 2) aromatic rule, where n = 0, 1, 0, respectively. The π-bonding orbital (HOMO
– 3 in 1, HOMO – 2 in 5) is
predominantly located on the C–P bond, the contributions of
Al and Li are only 5 and 3%. Thus, the π bonds are basically
localized in nature. The C–P σ bond is close to the single
covalent bond, as the WBIC–P (1.87 in 1 and 1.92 in 5) indicated. Thus, there are C=E
double bonds in ptC CLiAl2E and CLi2AlE (E =
P, As, Sb, Bi) clusters, which have some negative impact on the electronic
delocalization.

To probe the π/σ aromaticity for these
ptC species,
NICS values in the Z direction were calculated on
the concerned points, including the centers of the triangles and the
points located at 1 Å above the centers of the triangles and
above the ptCs, respectively. The NICSZZ (1) and NICSZZ (0) values for 1–8 clusters are depictured in Figure S3. Most of NICSZZ (1) and NICSZZ (0) with negative values,
indicating each of 1–8 has a certain
degree of π/σ aromaticity. According to the data, 1–4 are more aromatic than 5–8. However, evaluating NICSZZ of several points seems to be inadequate. The magnetic
criterion isochemical shielding surface (ICSS) calculation is handled
in a three-dimensional grid of lattice points and direction and anisotropy
effects can be quantified in a more straightforward way. Contrary
to the NICS approach, positive ICSS values indicate diatropic ring
currents and aromaticity, while negative values indicate paratropic
ring currents and antiaromaticity. Here, we used ICSSZZ (1) and ICSSZZ (0),
the shielding tensor component perpendicular to the studied molecular
planes at 1 and 0 Å above them, to characterize π and σ
aromaticity of representative clusters 1 and 5. To more intuitively observe the aromaticity, the color-filled maps
of ICSSZZ (1) and ICSSZZ (0) of 1 and 5 are plotted in Table S4, compared with 18ve-CAl3P
and 12ve-CLi3P. As shown in Table S4, going down from 18ve-CAl3P to 12ve-CLi3P,
both π and σ electrons delocalization decrease. Al atom
can partly participate in the π and σ electrons delocalization,
while the Li atom has little contribution to the electron delocalization.
Al atoms have more contribution to the σ electrons delocalization
in comparison with the π electrons delocalization. The π
electrons mainly located around the C/P, and a few of them delocalized.
In 18ve-CAl3P, the π electrons are a little delocalized,
while the σ electrons are fully delocalized. Replacing all Al
with Li atoms, the 12ve-CLi3P formed, whose π and
σ electrons are localized. The π and σ electrons
delocalization of 16ve-CLiAl2P and 14ve-CLi2AlP are intermediate between CAl3P and CLi3P. The π and σ electrons delocalization are beneficial
but not required for these ptC species. Thus, these ptC 1–8 clusters are stable, benefiting from one π
and three σ bonds around ptC, and one periphery L–L σ
bond.

4.2 Electron Counting to Stabilize ptC Species
vs the Unnecessary Lone Pairs of Ligands
As we all know,
18ve counting is originally proposed to stabilize the ptC, which refers
to the total valence of a ptC system including bonding electrons and
nonbonding electrons. The ptC is always stabilized in a specific chemical
environment, which is dominated by the ligands. The C–ligand
and ligand–ligand bondings are important for the stabilities
of ptC species, while some LPs of ligands seem to be unnecessary.
Here, we take 18ve-CAl3P, 16ve-CLiAl2P, 14ve-CLi2AlP, and 12ve-CLi3P as the examples to discuss
the relations between the electron counting and the unnecessary lone
pairs of ligands.

The AdNDP bonding patterns of 18ve-CAl3P, 16ve-CLiAl2P, 14ve-CLi2AlP, and 12ve-CLi3P are depictured in Figure 4. We analyze 16ve-CLiAl2P first. Each Al/P
atom has one LP, thus, there are three LPs. There is one delocalized
σ bond on the periphery LiAlPAl ring. The residual eight electrons
can correspond to C–L bonding: one 2c–2e C–P
π bond, one C–P σ bond, and two delocalized 3c–2e
(Al–C–Al) σ bonds. All ON values are close to
the expected 2.00 |e|. The AdNDP conclusion accords with the above
CMO analyses. Although there are some differences in compositions,
geometries, and numbers of valence electrons, these ptC species have
two aspects in common: their ptC core is held together by the same
2π/6σ frameworks, which collectively follow the octet
rule; in addition, there is one 4c–2e delocalized σ bond
in each ptC species. Thus, the 2π/6σ frameworks and peripheral
4c–2e L–L σ bonds are crucial for the stabilities
of these ptC species. Going down from 18ve-CAl3P to 12ve-CLi3P, the peripheral lone pairs (LPs) are diminishing in number.
As the first column shown, the LPs of Al atoms gradually decrease
from three to zero from top to bottom, while the LP of P is still
intact. Thus, the LPs of Al atoms seem to be unnecessary. In these
ptC species, only one electron of each Al atom is used to form chemical
bonding with its neighbors, except for an LP. As shown in Figure 5, the electron localization
function (ELF) color-filled map for (a) CAl3P, (b) CLiAl2P, (c) CLi2AlP, and (d) CLi3P further
confirmed the above conclusion. The good stabilities of them suggest
that the LPs of Al atoms in these species are less important, even
unnecessary and can be removed. Thus, removing the unnecessary lone
pairs of ligands should be a new strategy, which can help us design
more new ptC species with the variable electron counting.

numbers (ONs).

4.3 Necessary LP of E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi)
To design the new ptCs by our strategy, it is needed to distinguish
the unnecessary and necessary LPs in the ptC clusters. There are also
some necessary LPs, which are important for the stability of ptCs.
Usually, these necessary LPs come from the nonmetal atom with the
relatively large electronegativity. There is one LP of E in the 18ve-CAl3P, 16ve-CLiAl2P, 14ve-CLi2AlP, and 12ve-CLi3P clusters, which is necessary to stabilize the ptC and cannot
be removed. There are strong competitions between ptC, tetrahedral
carbon (thC), and tri coordinate carbon (trC) isomers. Using the Al
atom to replace the P atom in ptC CAl3P, CLiAl2P, CLi2AlP, and CLi3P clusters, we got the
16ve-CAl4, 14ve-CLiAl2P, 12ve-CLi2AlP, and 10ve-CLi3Al, which prefer to possess the thC
or trC structures. Thus, these LPs are necessary for maintaining the
stabilities of ptCs. Why are they important? There are electrostatic
repulsion among the four positively charged Al ligands, which make
that thC is more favored than ptC for 16ve-CAl4. The LP
of P atom in 18ve-CAl3P, can help to attract the two adjacent
Al atoms due to electrostatic interactions between the LP and the
ligands. In addition, three 3p electrons of P can contribute to form
stronger bonding with the central ptC and other ligands. Thus, the
LP of E is important for the stability of 18ve-CAl3P, 16ve-CLiAl2P, 14ve-CLi2AlP, and 12ve-CLi3P clusters.

5 Summary
In summary, we have certificated
that it is possible to replace
the Al atoms in previously reported ptC-containing global minima C2v 18ve-CAl3E (E
= P, As, Sb, Bi) with the Li to design the new ptC species CLiAl2E (E = P, As, Sb, Bi) and CLi2AlE (E = P, As, Sb,
Bi). These 16ve and 14ve ptC species are the global minima (except
for CLiAL2P) with the peculiar C=E double bonds.
In nature, it is the new strategy that help us to the design these
ptC species, which is removing the unnecessary lone pairs of ligands.
For a ptC cluster, one π and three σ bonds for the C–ligand
bonding, and one σ bond for the ligand–ligand bonding
are important. The 18ve counting and fully delocalized (2π and
6σ) are not required.
