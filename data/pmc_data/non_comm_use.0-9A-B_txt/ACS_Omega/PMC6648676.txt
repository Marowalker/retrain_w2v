deep eutectic system (DES)-mediated sp3-CH functionalization
of acetophenones 1 with benzyl alcohols 2 to the corresponding α, β-saturated ketones 3 is accounted for. The domino dehydrogenation–aldol condensation

Introduction
The sp3-CH
functionalization of ketones is an atom-efficient
strategy for C–C bond formation.1−5 The metal (Pd, Ru, Ir, and other transition metals)-catalyzed borrowing
hydrogen (BH) strategy has an emerging enthusiasm in ketone alkylation
with alcohols.6−8 The BH concept as presented in Scheme 1 involves temporary oxidation of alcohol
into the carbonyl compound through the dehydrogenation strategy. The
carbonyl compounds formed have high reactivity owing to their electrophilicity
in forming the C–C bond.9,10 The carbonyl compound
at this point through intermediate
chalcone (via condensation with the α-CH unit of a ketone) experienced
reduction through hydrogen transfer from the transition-metal hydride,
resulting in C–C bond formation with water as a byproduct.

Scheme 2 Borrowing Hydrogen Strategy—sp3 C–H Functionalization
of Ketones with Alcohols Using Deep Eutectic Systems
Recently, Wang, Gülcemal, and co-workers
have demonstrated
application of iridium complexes in sp3 C–H functionalization
utilizing t-amyl alcohol and toluene as a solvent,
though at high temperatures11−13 Likewise, Du and co-workers utilized
RhCl(CO)(PPh3)2 and 1,4-dioxane solvent systems,14 and other researchers utilized different volatile
organic solvents and transition metals such as Fe, Co, and Pd.15−18 In the above strategy, phosphines (as a P-donor ligand) were fundamental
in stabilizing the active low-oxidation states.19−22 Lang and co-workers reported
Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, xantphos
(P-donor ligand), and NaOH23 system and
demonstrated the vital role of transition metals as well as ligands.
Coordinating ligands played an important role in cyclometalation with
transition metals as directing groups,19 thereby facilitating selectivity. By binding to the metal center,
a ligand-promoted direct C–H activation24,25 is realized. The involvement of cyclometalation is the key approach
in C–C bond forming reactions.26−28 However, to avoid toxic
solvents, the green chemical approach is essential. Consequently,
researchers have reported ILs (ionic liquids) in many organic reactions.29−33 Notwithstanding their non-biodegradability is a noteworthy concern
in the green chemical approach.

In a similar manner, deep eutectic
solvent (DES), a low-melting
mixture (Figure 1)
has risen as a promising sustainable alternate in organic reaction
media and in other fields, attributable to their ready availability.
Although DES is closely associated with ILs,34−38 they are more beneficial owing to the smaller size,
transport properties, lower toxicity, high polarity, cost-effectiveness,
operational simplicity, and biodegradability of their cations and
anions. Moreover, most of the organic reactions required a catalyst
to promote reactions. Interestingly, low-melting mixtures can act
as reaction medium to facilitate the completion of the organic reactions
in a clean and smooth manner without the need of any catalyst or additives.
The academic and industrial researchers are developing new methods
in decreasing chemical waste. Along these lines, DES-mediated reactions
were investigated in sp3 C–H functionalization of
the ketone. Consequently, in the present study, a combination of palladium
complexes such as Pd(PPh3)4 and xantphos was
investigated in DES as a green reaction medium or additive to avoid
toxic, volatile organic solvents.

Likewise, the quinolines
are an important class of heterocyclic
compounds,39−41 owing to their potential pharmacological properties,
namely, antimalarial,42,43 antibacterial,44,45 antiasthmatic, anti-inflammatory,46,47 antihypertensive
inhibiting properties, and so forth. Despite numerous methods including
Friedländer,48−50 Combes,51,52 Conrad-Limpach,53 Doebner von Miller, Skraup and Camps quinoline
synthesis, and so forth,54−57 reported previously, herein, we report the DES-assisted
Friedländer quinoline synthesis.

To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first case of DES-assisted
Pd(0)-catalyzed α-alkylation of ketones with benzyl alcohols
to form corresponding α-alkylated enones exclusively. Subsequently,
the application of the low-melting mixture ChCl (choline chloride)
and l-(+)-malonic acid-melt system in the domino Friedländer
and α-alkylation via Friedländer’s quinoline synthesis
reaction have additionally been successfully attempted (Scheme 2).

Results and Discussion
At first, screening of reaction conditions utilizing transition-metal
catalysts, namely, NiCl2, CuCl2, FeFl3, and PdCl2 with acetophenone 1a and benzyl
alcohol 2a and K2CO3 as a base
in toluene at 80 °C was performed. Low yields of 10–15%
were obtained (Table 1, entries 1–4); further, by shifting the base to CS2CO3 or KOtBu in PdCl2, 25% yield was obtained (Table 1, entry 5, 6). KOtBu being
a strong base improved the yield in contrast to mild base K2CO3 with 20% yield in Pd(CH3COO)2 (Table 1, entry 7).
Consequently, rest of the optimizations was performed with KOtBu, and a slight improvement in yield was observed with an
increased Palladium loading (Table 1, entry 8). Also, the introduction of the ligand in
the reaction brought about an enhancement of yield. It is suggested
that the ligands are capable of binding metal ions via multiple sites
through their lone pairs of electrons (on more than one atom), that
is, cyclometalation resulted in selectivity and enhancement of reaction
yield. Thus, the PPh3 ligand enhanced yield up to 40% in
short reaction time (Table 1, entry 9). Among different ligands attempted, a better yield
of 60% was accomplished by utilizing Xantphos, a bidentate diphosphine
and trans-spanning ligand (Table 1, entry 10–13). The reaction trials with just
transition-metal catalysts without the ligand were futile, demonstrating
their necessity in the reaction. For instance, with 10 mol % of Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, KOtBu, in toluene an unsatisfying yield of 30% was obtained (Table 1, entry 14) while
with Pd2(dba)3, PdCl2(PPh3)2, and Pd(PPh3)4 (Table 1, entry 15–17), 20, 40,
and 50% of yields, respectively, were obtained . Subsequently, the
impact of ligand, base, catalysts, and their loading has been explored.
The results revealed that 1.5 equiv of benzyl alcohol and 2 equiv
of KOtBu and 10 mol % of the catalyst
brought about quantitative product yield in a shorter time of reaction.
Similarly, the xantphos–phosphorous ligand in the presence
of Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, Pd2(dba)3, PdCl2(PPh3)2, and Pd(PPh3)4 gave increased product yields
of 50, 70, 80, and 85, respectively (Table 1 entry 18–21). Strikingly, Pd(PPh3)4–xantphos–KOtBu–toluene combination at 90 °C offered moderate
to good yield in shorter reaction time. Having optimized reaction
conditions in hand, we explored the application of ChCl-based DES
as reaction medium or additive with the intention of eliminating toxic
and volatile organic solvents and to accomplish the desired product
in high yields. One of the fundamental advantages of DESs is its exceptionally
straight forward synthetic process. Further, the present study was
attempted to explore C–H alkylation utilizing less expensive
DES reaction medium as well as the additive to avoid toxic solvents
and expensive catalysts such as Ir, Rh, and Ru. Initially acetophenone 1a reacted with benzyl alcohol 2a, utilizing
Pd(PPh3)4, xantphos, and KOtBu in ChCl–oxalic acid—DES at 80 °C for
6 h, to give 80% yield (Table 1, entry 22). It is evident that in the earlier reports,11,12,23,58−60 a volatile and toxic solvent has been utilized, including
toluene, 1,4-dioxane, t-amyl alcohol, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and so forth. However, in the present
work to avoid toxic organic solvents, the DES made from cheap and
biodegradable choline chloride has been utilized (Table 2). The DES presented several
advantages, namely, green reaction medium, additive and catalyst,
high conversion, easy workup, low cost, and environment friendliness.
The streamlining of different DES in the palladium-catalyzed α-alkylation
of benzyl alcohols was tabulated (Table 1, entry 23–32). The efficiency of
the reaction was strongly dependent on the nature of the DES. The
employment of deep eutectic ChCl–malonic acid has brought a
moderate-to-high yield, whereas the relatively weak hydrogen bonding
interaction containing DES-like (ChCl–urea) resulted in trace
conversion of the product. By optimizing different DESs, best results
were obtained in the formation of the α-alkylated product. The
results also depended on the loading of the DES, that is, lowering
the amount of DES to 1.0 equiv was feasible. However, further reduction
of DES gave lower efficiency. According to optimization studies, ChCl–malonic
acid (Table 1, entry
23) emerged out as an efficient DES for the reaction medium. Further,
it is evident that only ChCl or malonic acid alone provided a trace
amount of the product (entry 40, 41 Table 1), while the combination of ChCl–malonic
acid (DES) provided a quantitative yield of the desired product formation.
The hydrogen bonding in the DES (as an additive and catalyst) is fundamental
for the selectivity of the products, that is, minimizing side products,
replacing toxic solvents as well as expensive transition-metal catalysts.
Accordingly, ChCl–malonic acid DES emerged out as the best
DES additive or reaction medium for different transition-metal catalysts
as tabulated (Table 1, entry 33–39). ChCl–malonic acid DES, Pd(PPh3)4, xantphos, and KOtBu combination
at 90 °C in 2 h (Table 1, entry 23) gave quantitative yield in short time in comparison
to the solvent-based optimization (Table 1).

The pH values of the prepared DES
were close to the pKa of carboxylic acids
utilized (Table 2).
Further, a pH-based study has been explored
to avoid the side product formation from the desired products. The
highly basic pH [as seen in toluene conditions (Table 3)], should be avoided to reduce the side
products (further reduction of the ketones to alcohols). The DES system
provided slightly basic medium under the reaction conditions, thereby
reducing side product formation (see Table 3). It is known that the several reaction
intermediates are involved in the desired product formation through
dehydrogenation and hydrogenation steps through ligand and base utilization,
consequently resulting in the increment of the basicity in the reaction
medium in toluene as well as DES; however, in the latter case, it
was neutralized to some extent because of acidic DES.

Coming to the mechanism,
DES has the ability of hydrogen bonding
with the reactants, thereby facilitating reaction progress as seen
in the plausible mechanism. Initially, benzyl alcohol is activated
by the DES, subsequently, which undergoes dehydrogenation as facilitated
by the palladium complex resulting in palladium hydride and benzaldehyde.
DES being an ionic medium involves H bonds with the oxygen atom of
the ketone group (activates), thereby increasing electrophilicity.
This facilitates the nucleophilic attack (Scheme 3) at aldehyde to offer the α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compound as an intermediate (chalcone) by removal of water.
At this point, the transfer of a proton from the palladium hydride
complex takes place resulting in α-alkylated saturated ketone
accompanied by regeneration of the active palladium complex. DES assumes
a dual role of solvent as well as a catalyst. Likewise, DES through
H bonding facilitates the formation of the palladium hydride complex
[PdH2]. The aldol condensation product chalcone and hydrogenation
by [PdH2] then provided the desired product in short reaction
time.

The reusability of the DES
was demonstrated by recovering the same
from the reaction mixture using aqueous workup after completion of
the reaction as ascertained by thin layer chromatography. In other
words, the reaction mixture was diluted with water to precipitate
and filter the desired products. Then, the filtrate was evaporated
to yield the DES–catalyst mixture which was reused for several
runs without significant loss in catalytic properties. The DES alone
was recycled utilizing CH2Cl2 or ether extraction
from the water (after water workup filtration of reaction products),
functional groups unaffected as evident from FT-IR signals (Figure 2) and tested successfully
in five subsequent runs in comparable product yields without loss
in their activity.

Figure 2 IR spectrum comparison of choline chloride–malonic
acid
(ChCl–MA) DES before and after the workup indicates no loss
in H bonding and hence no loss in activity.

Having streamlined the reaction conditions in the ChCl–malonic-based
DES, the scope of the reaction was explored utilizing electron-rich
and electron-deficient acetophenones, such as 3-methyl, 4-methyl,
4-methoxy, 4-trifluoro, 3-hydroxy, 4-hydroxy, and 4-fluoro acetophenones,
and corresponding benzyl alcohols. The sp3 C–H functionalization
underwent smoothly to provide α-alkylated enones 3a–m in high yields as tabulated in (Table 4). Moreover, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, 4 reacted sequentially with acetyl acetone 5 and
benzyl alcohol 2a in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4, xantphos, KOtBu, and different
DESs. The optimization revealed that ChCl–oxalic acid gave
the 65% Friedländer reaction—α-alkylation product, 6a (Table 5, entry 1) while ChCl–tartaric acid and ChCl–malonic
acid melt resulted in 70 and 80% yield, respectively (Table 5 entry 4, 2).

Generally, Friedländer
quinoline reaction undergoes in the
presence of acid or base, given literature reports in the introduction
part. There is no such literature from the DES method; herein, DES
facilitated the Friedländer reaction as well as α-alkylation
among the tested DES (Table 5, entry 1–11). Further, among the tested transition-metal
catalyst, Pd(PPh3)4, ChCl–malonic acid
DES, xantphos, and KOtBu combination at
90 °C in 3 h gave a quantitative yield of 6a (Table 5, entry 2, 12–18).
The scope of the sequential Friedländer reaction and the α-alkylation
reaction has been investigated by changing the substitutions on N-heterocyclic
ketone and the influence on the yield of the desired product, 6 is tabulated in (Table 6). It is noteworthy to emphasize that, in all cases,
byproduct-reductive products, ketals, and hemiketals formation were
not observed. The reaction outcomes are identical comparing to earlier
reports using iridium and11,12,60,61 ruthenium,23,62 in organic solvents (Table 7).

Control Experiments
To support the role of DES in the
sequential Friedländer-α-alkylation reaction between
ketone 4 acetylacetone 5 and benzyl alcohol 2 control reactions were performed in the presence or absence
of the Pd catalyst. The reaction outcome revealed the chalcone intermediate
formation 8 [as evidenced from gas chromatography–mass
spectroscopy (GC–MS) analysis] in the presence of the Pd catalyst
similar to the mechanism established so far7 (see the Supporting Information). Anyway
in the absence of the Pd catalyst, the quinoline methyl ketone formation
was observed 7 (see, Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Control Experiment
α-Alkylation of acetophenone with benzyl
alcohol without
the presence of catalyst-methyl ketone, 4 (1.0 mmol),
benzyl alcohol 2 (1.0 mmol), KOtBu (1.5 mmol), ChCl–malonic acid (1:1) (100 mg) DES,
and xantphos (10 mol %), at 90 °C were charged into a screw-capped
glass vial and heated at 90 °C. After 3 h, the crude reaction
mixture was analyzed by using GC–MS, and there was no chalcone
intermediate 8 observed. However in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mol %), GC–MS analysis revealed chalcone
intermediate 8 formation.

Conclusions
Overall,
an efficient C–C bond formation through α-alkylation
(BH strategy) of ketones with benzyl alcohols in DES was established.
This method proved to be a broad functional group tolerant with wide
substrate scope. At the same time, we developed an efficient, catalyst-free,
sequential Friedländer reaction-α alkylation using DES
as an environmental friendly reaction medium without further addition
of toxic solvents such as toluene, dioxane, t-amyl
alcohol, and so forth. This is the first time this method is adapted
to produce such kind of C–C bond formation with DES. This method
also provided mild reaction conditions, simple workup, and high product
yields. The synthesized products are highly useful synthetic blocks
in further functionalization which are in progress in our laboratory
and will be communicated soon separately elsewhere.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals and reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals Ltd and used without further
purification. The reactions were performed by using screw-capped glass
vials in Apptec Lab Mate Manual Parallel Synthesizer. TLC was performed
by using precoated aluminum TLC sheets (silica gel 60 F254, Merck).
After the reaction, the reaction mixture was passed through, manual
column chromatography was performed by silica gel (100–200
mesh, Merck and Co.) to give the pure product on petroleum ether and
the ethyl acetate solvent system. FTIR spectra were recorded by using
the Shimadzu IRTracer-100 FTIR Spectrometer. Wave numbers (νmax) are reported in cm–1. NMR spectra were
recorded by using Bruker AVANCE-III (400 MHz) in CDCl3,
and chemical shift delta values (d) are reported
in ppm (δ).

All our reactions are carried out in the LabMate Personal Manual Parallel Synthesizer, (see the Supporting Information) in closed vessels to
exclude byproducts.

Scheme 5 ChCl–Malonic Acid Deep Eutectic Solvent Preparation34
Preparation of Choline Chloride-Based Deep Eutectic Solvents
(ChCl DES)
DES is a binary mixture of a salt and hydrogen
bond donor (HBD), here tried with salt and HBD (organic acid composition).
Choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents were prepared according
to the literature (Scheme 5);34,36 choline chloride and the second component (HBD) were mixed on the
basis of different amount ratios reported in Table 2, and reactants were heated until a clear
liquid solution appeared, Abbott, et al. (2004).34 Obtained DES was used directly without any further purification
(Figure 1).

α-Alkylation
of Methyl Ketones
Acetophenone 1 (1.0 mmol),
benzyl alcohol 2 (1.0 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mol %), xantphos (10 mol %), and KOtBu (1.5 mmol) were stirred in ChCl–malonic
acid (1:1) DES at 90 °C after reaction completion was monitored
by using TLC and the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted
CH2Cl2 solvent. The crude reaction mixture after
solvent removal was passed through manual column chromatography on
silica gel to provide the pure product, 3a.

Sequential
Friedländer Reaction-α Alkylation
A mixture
of 2-amino5-chlorobenzophenone 4 (1.0 mmol)
and acetyl acetone 5 (1.0 mmol) in DES was heated at
90 °C for 30 min to offer Friedländer product, 6. Then, benzyl alcohol 2 (1.0 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (10 mol %), xantphos (10 mol %), and KOtBu (1.5 equiv) was added and continued stirring at
90 °C till reaction completion as monitored by TLC. Then, the
reaction mixture was diluted by using water and extracted with CH2Cl2 solvent. The reaction mixture after evaporation
of the solvent was passed through column chromatography on silica
gel to give the pure product, 6a.
