A main
challenge in the development of anticancer drugs that eradicate
cancer cells specifically with minimal toxicity to normal cells is
to identify the cancer-specific properties. Cancer cells sustain a
higher level of reactive oxygen species, owing to metabolic and signaling
aberrations and unrestrained growth. Cancer cells are also furnished
with a powerful reducing environment, owing to the overproduction
of antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH). Therefore, the altered
redox balance is probably the most prevailing property of cancer cells
distinct from normal cells, which could serve as a plausible therapeutic
target. In this work, we developed a GSH-depleting pro-oxidant, benzoyloxy
dibenzyl carbonate, termed B2C, which is capable of rapidly declining
GSH and elevating oxidative stress to a threshold level above which
cancer cells cannot survive. B2C was designed to release quinone methide
(QM) that rapidly depletes GSH through esterase-mediated hydrolysis.
B2C was able to rapidly deplete GSH and induce an overwhelming level
of oxidative stress in cancer cells, leading to mitochondrial disruption,
activation of procaspase-3 and PARP-1, and cleavage of Bcl-2. In the
study of tumor xenograft models, intravenously injected B2C caused
apoptotic cell death in tumors and significantly suppressed tumor
growth. These findings provide a new insight into the design of more
effective anticancer drugs, which exploit altered redox balance in
cancer cells.

Introduction
Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) act crucial roles in biological processes
as a secondary messenger in cellular signaling to activate proliferation
and survival pathways.1,2 Despite their fundamental roles,
excessive ROS induces oxidative stress, which provokes DNA damages,
mutagenesis, and even cell death.3,4 Cells therefore
should sustain redox homeostasis to maintain normal cellular functions
and ensure cell survival.1 Contrary to
normal cells, cancer cells sustain an elevated level of ROS resulting
from metabolic and signaling aberrations and unrestrained growth.1,5,6 The high level of ROS drives cancer
cell proliferation and enhances the aggressive phenotypes of cancer
cells such as promotion of mutations, invasion, and metastasis.7,8 Therefore, cancer cells must upregulate multiple antioxidant defense
systems to overwhelm the high level of ROS and overcome detrimental
effects of oxidative stress.6 The upregulation
of antioxidants in adjustment to inherent oxidative stress is also
known to confer resistance to chemotherapeutics and radiation.3 A recent study has reported that cancer cells
extremely depend on their antioxidant systems to sustain redox balance
and are hypersensitive to exogenous agents that damage antioxidant
capability.5

Although the roles of
ROS in cancer cells still remain controversial,
it is reasonable to employ the biochemical differences in redox balance
between normal and cancer cells as an effective basis for selective
toxicity toward cancer cells.5,9 A simple and promising
strategy to target cancer cells by ROS-mediated mechanism is the suppression
of antioxidant systems in cancer cells. Among various endogenous antioxidants,
GSH, a tripeptide of Glu-Cys-Gly, is a major ROS-scavenging system
and plays fundamental roles in sustaining redox homeostasis.6 GSH is also known to be the largest source of
nonprotein thiol groups in cells and is considered to be the most
abundant and important antioxidant.10,11 In addition,
the GSH antioxidant pathway is desired for tumor initiation and development.1 Therefore, depletion of antioxidant GSH alters
cell’s ability to modulate ROS and causes accumulation of ROS
to a level or the threshold above which cells cannot survive.5 In contrast, normal cells are less susceptible
to GSH depleting agents, owing to a low basal level of ROS and well-maintained
redox balance.2

There is cumulative
evidence demonstrating that GSH inhibition
induces severe ROS accumulation and raises oxidative stress, causing
cancer cell death.3,5,12 β-Phenethyl
isocyanate (PEITC) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate abundant
in cruciferous vegetables such as watercress and is also known to
accumulate ROS in cancer cells.5,13 It was reported that
PEITC conjugates with GSH for export from cancer cells and elevate
the level of ROS, consequently resulting in cell death.14,15 QM, an α,β-unsaturated ketone, is an intermediate generated
from hydrolysis of phenolic ester compounds and is also well known
to readily alkylate GSH.2,16 Hulsman et al. reported
that an unsubstituted QM generated immediately after esterase-catalyzed
carboxylic ester hydrolysis reacts selectively with cellular GSH,
triggering cell death.17 This GSH scavenger
exhibited potent anticancer activity, although one QM intermediate
could deplete only one GSH. We therefore hypothesized that a GSH scavenger
that is able to deplete two GSH molecules could elicit higher anticancer
activity and a low dose is required to achieve sufficient anticancer
therapeutic effects.

In this context, we developed a pro-oxidant,
benzoyloxy dibenzyl
carbonate (B2C), which is able to generate two QM intermediates and
rapidly deplete two GSH molecules through alkylation of thiol. B2C
was designed to undergo esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of phenolic
ester to produce two QM intermediates and enhance ROS accumulation,
resulting in cancer cell death (Figure 1). We have undertaken extensive studies to determine
the anticancer therapeutic efficacy and the mode of action of pro-oxidant
B2C using cell cultures and xenograft mouse models. Herein, we report
that multiple GSH-depleting B2C holds remarkable translational potential
as a targeted anticancer therapeutic agent.

structure of B2C.

Results
Design and
Synthesis of B2C
B2C was designed to undergo
esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to release two QM intermediates, which
then deplete two GSH molecules. The synthetic route and chemical structure
are shown in Figure 1. Hydroxybenzyl alcohol was reacted with benzoyl chloride to generate
4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl benzoate (1). 1 was
then reacted with 1,1-dicarbonyldiimidazole to yield 4-(benzoyloxy)benzyl
1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate (2). From
the reaction of 1 and 2, B2C, 4,4′-(carbonylbis(oxy)bis(methylene))bis(4,1-phenylene)
dibenzoate, was obtained in the form of a white powder (60% yield).
The chemical structure of B2C was verified by NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1). B2C was highly stable, as demonstrated
by no change in NMR spectra after 3 days of incubation under aqueous
conditions (Figure S2). For comparison
purposes, we also synthesized B1C, which is able to generate one QM
intermediate. In addition, DBC was synthesized, which does not generate
a QM intermediate (Figure S3).

Esterase-Triggered
QM Generation from B2C
B2C could
be easily attacked by esterase to undergo carboxylic ester hydrolysis.
As shown in Figure 2a, esterase-triggered hydrolysis of carboxylic ester of B2C generates
two QM intermediates through energetically favorable 1,6-elimination
of phenolates. We first examined the ability of B2C to deplete GSH
in the presence or absence of esterase. Figure 2b shows the level of GSH determined 24 h
after the addition of B2C. B2C significantly declined the level of
GSH in the presence of esterase in a concentration-dependent manner.
However, in the absence of esterase, slight GSH depletion was induced
by a high concentration of B2C (1 mM). These results indicate that
carboxylic ester of B2C is readily attacked by esterase to release
GSH-depleting QM intermediates. We also compared B2C with B1C and
DBC (Figure 2c). As
expected, B1C could also deplete GSH in the presence of esterase but
to a substantially less extent than B2C, and DBC was unable to deplete
GSH.

We next studied the ability
of B2C to scavenge intracellular GSH
in esterase-triggered manners using various cancer cells (SW620, DU145,
and A549 cell lines). B2C dramatically reduced the level of intracellular
GSH in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2d–f). B2C at a concentration of 50
μM depleted a majority of GSH. In particular, SW620 cells exhibited
the most reduction in the level of GSH after B2C treatment.

B2C-Induced
Cell Death
MTT assay was performed to evaluate
the cytotoxicity of B2C toward various cancer cells. After 24 h of
B2C treatment, the cell viability markedly decreased with increasing
concentration of B2C (Figure 3). B2C exhibited the strongest toxicity against SW620 cells,
which underwent the most reduction in the level of GSH (Figure 2d). In addition, B2C displayed
significantly higher toxicity than B1C and DBC. Normal cells (RAW
264.7) were also killed by B2C but to less extent than cancer cells
(Figure S4) probably because of their well-maintained
redox balance. We next compared the anticancer activity of B2C with
PEITC that is known to kill cancer cells by exporting GSH from cells.
As shown in Figure S5, B2C exerted stronger
anticancer activity than PEITC at the same concentration.

B2C-Mediated Elevation
of Oxidative Stress
To confirm
whether B2C depletes GSH to elevate oxidative stress, the level of
intracellular ROS was evaluated by flow cytometry. After incubation
with various concentrations of B2C, cells were stained with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate
(DCFH-DA) as a probe of ROS. B2C treatment increased markedly the
level of intracellular ROS, evidenced by the rightward shift of fluorescence
(Figure 4a–c
and Figure S6). However, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) suppressed B2C-induced accumulation
of ROS (Figure S7). These results indicate
that B2C depletes GSH to allow cancer cells to accumulate more ROS.

of 0 μM; †††p < 0.001 relative to the same concentration of B2C + NAC (1 mM).

To further verify whether B2C
provokes cancer cell death through
the elevation of oxidative stress, the cell viability was measured
in the presence of NAC. Although NAC (1 mM) could not completely prevent
B2C-induced cell death, the cytotoxicity of B2C was significantly
diminished by NAC (Figure 4d–f). These observations demonstrate that B2C kills
cancer cells through the elevation of oxidative stress resulting from
the depletion of antioxidant GSH.

B2C-Mediated Apoptotic
Cell Death
Cell cycle assay
was performed to examine whether B2C affects cell cycle distribution
of cancer cells (Figure 5a and Figure S8). B2C caused no significant
changes in the percentage in G2/M phase but significantly
increased the portion in the sub-G0 phase, which is indicative
of possible induction of cellular apoptosis.18,19 To substantiate B2C-induced cell death, flow cytometry was employed
to analyze cancer cells with FITC-conjugated Annexin V as an apoptosis
marker and propidium iodide as a viability marker. As shown in Figure 5b and Figure S9, the populations of the upper right
quadrant increased with B2C concentrations, demonstrating that B2C
induces apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. Cells were
also analyzed using JC-1 because the mitochondrial disruption is one
of features of early apoptosis.2 B2C induced
a substantial loss of mitochondrial membrane in concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 5c).

assay of SW620 cells after B2C treatment. (b) Flow cytometric analysis
of cells stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. (c) Flow
cytometric analysis for mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1.
Data are representative of three independent experiments.

To gain mechanistic insight into how B2C triggers
apoptosis, we
carried out Western blotting for Bcl-2, caspase 3, and PARP-1. As
shown in Figure 6 and Figure S10, B2C effectively suppressed the expression
of Bcl-2 and induced the cleavage of pro-apoptotic proteins caspase
3 and PARP-1. These observations demonstrate that B2C induces significant
mitochondrial disruption, leading to apoptotic cascades.

B2C on the expression of apoptosis-related proteins
in SW620 cells.

Antitumor Activity of B2C
Therapeutic activity of B2C
was evaluated using a mouse xenograft model. B2C was intravenously
injected through a tail vein every other day, and the tumor volume
and body weight were monitored for 25 days (Figure 7). B2C at doses less than 5 mg/kg exerted
insignificant inhibitory effects on tumor growth. However, B2C remarkably
suppressed the tumor growth without changes in body weight at doses
higher than 10 mg/kg. Histological examination was carried out further
to verify anticancer activity of B2C. Untreated groups showed a large
number of tumor cells that sustain their normal morphology with apparent
membrane and nuclear structure. However, a number of dead cells without
nuclei were observed in tumors of the B2C-treated group (Figure 8a). A large number
of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end (TUNEL)-positive
cells were observed in B2C-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 8b and Figure S11). The results suggest that B2C causes
apoptotic cancer cell death in tumors.

Finally, to study the
potential cumulative toxicity of B2C, we
administrated B2C (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. B2C administration caused
no significant changes in the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
(Figure S12a). In addition, no substantial
histological evidence of accumulated toxicity in organs after B2C
administration was observed (Figure S12b–d). The results demonstrate that B2C has excellent safety profiles
at therapeutic doses.

Discussion
In the development of
anticancer drugs that eradicate cancer cells
specifically with minimal toxicity to normal cells, a main challenge
is to identify the cancer-specific properties.20 Although there have been enormous efforts to exploit the
differences between normal and cancer cells as a plausible therapeutic
target, many of these strategies have failed to demonstrate sufficient
therapeutic activities.21 Among the various
unique features of cancer cells distinct from normal cells, the most
prevailing property is probably the redox state.20 Compared to normal cells, cancer cells have not only a
higher level of ROS but also a strong reducing environment due mainly
to the overproduction of GSH.3,22,23 It has been well accepted that normal cells are less likely to be
damaged by elevated oxidative stress, owing to their high level of
antioxidant systems, which provides a logical basis of cancer cell-selective
toxicity.2,11,24 Notably, most
conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are known to induce oxidative
insults to eradicate cancer cells.20 On
the basis of the redox potential gradient between cancer cells and
normal cells, oxidative therapy has recently been emerging as an anticancer
treatment regimen.18,22,23,25

GSH is considered the major mechanism
used to control the cellular
redox balance.2 The functions of GSH include
reduction of ROS such as H2O2 generated in mitochondria
and detoxification of increased production of lipid peroxidase.20 Cancer cells greatly need a high level of GSH
for their proliferation and survival.18 We therefore developed B2C that could deplete two GSH molecules
to elevate oxidative stress and preferentially kill cancer cells based
on the hypothesis that GSH depletion effectively provokes selective
toxicity against a wide variety of cancer cells. To deliver precise
proof of this hypothesis, we also synthesized model compounds, one
GSH-depleting B1C and one GSH-nondepleting DBC.

B2C was synthesized
by coupling two benzoyloxy-substituted benzyl
alcohols (QM-generating moiety) using a carbonate bond that functions
as a leaving group (Figure 1). Therefore, the design of B2C fulfills the requirements
for esterase-triggered QM generation that a phenolic ester (QM-generating
moiety) is substituted with a p-methylene group attached
to a good leaving group.2,17 In the presence of
esterase, B2C depleted GSH significantly more than B1C and DBC (Figure 2b,c) at the same
concentrations. In good accordance with these results, B2C dramatically
reduced the intracellular level of GSH in a concentration-dependent
manner. B2C showed more potent GSH-depleting activity and higher toxicity
against cancer cells compared to B1C and DBC. Interestingly, 50 μM
B1C exerted almost the same level of cytotoxicity as 25 μM B2C
(Figure S13). These observations obviously
support our hypotheses that esterase-catalyzed ester hydrolysis of
B2C affords QM intermediates to deplete GSH and the toxicity of QM-generating
compounds is dictated by the number of QM intermediates generated
from esterase-triggered hydrolysis of phenolic ester bonds.

To further demonstrate the advantages of B2C over B1C and the significance
of GSH depleting capability, direct comparison of therapeutic efficacy
was made between B2C and B1C. As expected, B2C showed significantly
higher anticancer activity than B1C at the same dose of 20 mg/kg (Figure S14). The higher therapeutic efficacy
of B2C can be explained by their different biodistribution and GSH-depleting
capability. As aforementioned, B2C was designed to release QM twice
as much as B1C, and the molecular weight of B1C is higher than half
of B2C. Therefore, assuming that they have the same cancer cell-targeting
ability and are administrated at the same dose, B1C needs to be accumulated
in tumors more than twice as much as B2C to exert the same therapeutic
efficacy as B2C. However, B1C has no ability to target cancer cells
more than twice as much as B2C. We therefore reason that the superior
therapeutic efficacy of B2C over B1C is attributed mainly to its more
potent GSH-depleting capability and coupling of two GSH-depleting
moieties is a promising chemical strategy for developing anticancer
therapeutics.

As shown in Figure S15, the level of
intracellular GSH varied with cells. We found that cancer cells (SW620,
DU145, and A549) showed a higher level of GSH than noncancerous cells
(RAW264.7) when cultured under the same condition. Among cancer cells
tested, A549 cells had the highest level of GSH. The extent of B2C-mediated
GSH depletion varied with cells because of their different levels
of intrinsic GSH. B2C at a concentration of 50 μM depleted a
majority of GSH. In particular, SW620 cells possessing a relatively
lower GSH level showed the most reduction in the level of GSH after
B2C treatment. As expected from these findings, the SW620 cell line
was the most susceptible to GSH-depleting B2C, evidenced by the lowest
cell viability (Figures 3a and 4d).

Our data illustrate that
esterase-catalyzed activation of B2C generates
two QM intermediates. We observed that B2C induces an overwhelming
level of oxidative stress in cancer cells to trigger mitochondrial
disruption, activation of procaspase-3 and PARP-1, and cleavage of
Bcl-2, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of B2C-induced
cell death by antioxidant NAC strongly suggests that elevation of
oxidative stress contributes predominantly to B2C-induced apoptotic
cell death. Proof-of-concept animal studies further demonstrate that
B2C as a GSH-scavenging pro-oxidant elicits substantial apoptotic
cell death in tumors and inhibits tumor growth without conspicuous
side effects to the liver and heart. However, further studies including
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicology are greatly needed
to fully determine the translational potential of B2C as an anticancer
drug. In particular, the effects of long-term use of B2C should be
investigated because deregulation of GSH production is tightly related
to several diseases such as diabetes.

Conclusions
We
developed the GSH-depleting pro-oxidant B2C as a new family
of oxidative anticancer therapeutics that can destroy preferentially
cancer cells through oxidative stress elevation. B2C was synthesized
by coupling benzoyloxy-substituted benzyl alcohols (QM-generating
moiety) through a carbonate bond. In the presence of esterase, B2C
rapidly generated QM that depletes antioxidant GSH to significantly
increase the level of ROS. B2C generated an overwhelming level of
oxidative stress in cancer cells to trigger mitochondrial disruption,
activation of procaspase-3 and PARP-1, and cleavage of Bcl-2, leading
to apoptotic cell death. In tumor-bearing mouse models, intravenously
injected B2C significantly suppressed the tumor growth without noticeable
side effects. We believe that GSH-depleting B2C provides a promising
strategy in the design of selective anticancer drugs and holds great
potential as anticancer therapeutics.

by silica gel chromatography and crystallization.

Cytotoxicity
of B2C
SW620, DU145, A549, and RAW 264.7
cells were incubated in a 24-well plate for 24 h. Cells with 90% confluency
were incubated with B2C (10, 25, or 50 μM) for 12 h. Cells were
then added to 100 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) solution and incubated for 4 h. Formazan crystals were
dissolved in 1 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The absorbance at
570 nm was measured after 10 min of incubation to determine the cell
viability using a microplate reader (Biotek Instruments, Winooski,
VT).

Measurement of the Level of GSH
One milliliter of GSH
solutions (500 μM) was mixed with B2C (10, 25, or 50 μM)
for 1 h with or without esterase (100 μg/mL). For another set
of experiments, B2C was added to the cells. One hour later, cells
were harvested and lysed on ice with 100 μL of lysis buffer.
Cell lysates were centrifuged (9800g), and the supernatant
(10 μL) was mixed with 50 μL of Ellman’s reagent
(0.5 mM, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). The microplate
reader was employed to measure the level of remaining GSH solution
and cellular GSH by measuring the optical density at 405 nm.

Flow Cytometry
SW620, DU145, and A549 cells were incubated
with B2C (10, 25, or 50 μM). For the detection of intracellular
ROS, cells were incubated with 2 μM DCFH-DA (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. For the analysis of apoptosis,
the cells were treated with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide purchased
from BD Biosciences Pharmigen (San Diego, CA). To demonstrate the
effect of B2C on the cell cycle, B2C-treated cells were stained with
propidium iodide (10 μg/mL) in the presence of RNase A. JC-1
assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to study the mitochondrial
membrane potential. The stained cells were transferred to 5 mL round-bottom
tubes and examined using a flow cytometer (FACS Caliber, Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA).

Immunoblotting
Cells were treated
with various concentrations
of B2C. Proteins were extracted from cells using a lysis buffer. Electrophoresis
was carried out using proteins (30 μg) on a 12% polyacrylamide
gel, and proteins were transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). After being blocked with 5% solution
of nonfat milk for 1 h, the blots were incubated with primary antibodies
(procaspase 3, PARP-1, and Bcl-2) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX) and HRP-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (BD Biosciences,
Mississauga, Canada). The immunoblot signals were developed using
SuperSignal Ultra chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Tumor-Bearing Mouse Model
SW620 cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into the dorsa of nude BALB/c mice (6 weeks old, Orient
Bio, Korea). When the inoculated tumor reached ∼50 mm3 in size, B2C dissolved in aqueous DMSO solution (20 mg/mL) was intravenously
injected seven times into mice at a dose of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg 2
days apart for 25 days. The body weight and tumor volume of mice were
measured 2 days apart. The tumor volume was determined using the following
formula: (width2 × length)/2. At the end of the experimentation,
mice were sacrificed, and solid tumors and organs were excised for
histological examination. Tissues were sliced and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and TUNEL. Animal experiments were approved by
the Institution Animal Ethical Committee of Chonbuk National University
(CBU2014-00024) and carried out in compliance with the national guidelines.

Statistical Analysis
Values were expressed as mean
± SD (standard deviation). One-way ANOVA (analysis of variation)
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 was conducted to make comparison between
groups. A difference of p < 0.05 was considered
significant statistically.
