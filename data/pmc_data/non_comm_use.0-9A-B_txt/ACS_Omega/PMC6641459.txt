DNA
nanostructures have been shown viable for the creation of complex
logic-enabled sensing motifs. To date, most of these types of devices
have been limited to the interaction with strictly DNA-type inputs.
Restriction endonuclease represents a class of enzyme with endogenous
specificity to DNA, and we hypothesize that these can be integrated
with a DNA structure for use as inputs to trigger structural transformation
and structural rearrangement. In this work, we reconfigured a three-arm
DNA switch, which utilizes a cyclic Förster resonance energy
transfer interaction between three dyes to produce complex output
for the detection of three separate input regions to respond to restriction
endonucleases, and investigated the efficacy of the enzyme targets.
We demonstrate the ability to use three enzymes in one switch with
no nonspecific interaction between cleavage sites. Further, we show
that the enzymatic digestion can be harnessed to expose an active
toehold into the DNA structure, allowing for single-pot addition of
a small oligo in solution.

Introduction
Sensors in their most
basic form are devices that recognize a target
and transduce that detection event into a signal that can be read
and interpreted by an end user. A variety of sensors exist to accommodate
a range of target types with chemical and biological targets being
of increased interest. One challenge in particular for biosensing
is interacting with the target using a probe that is relatively of
the same size. Nanoscale structures have this advantage given many
biomolecules are on the order of a few nanometers.1−9 DNA nanostructures, pioneered by Seeman,10 use the binding of Watson–Crick base pairs to program specific,
non-native formations that can then perform various tasks at the nanoscale,
and this technology is particularly suited for biosensing because
it is a native biological material.11−14 DNA nanostructures have been
shown to be highly modular for the creation of a range of two-dimensional
and three-dimensional motifs, including both static and dynamic structures.15−18 The work within dynamic systems has often focused on induced motion
through competitive DNA hybridization, such as multistep logic,19 hybridization chain reaction,20 DNA tweezers,21 and hinged lid
boxes.22 This is a highly adaptable design
regime that allows for rapid switching of states and a nearly limitless
range of possible sequences to use. The strategy however is less adapted
for non-nucleic acid sensor targets. The ability to adapt the modularity
of DNA structural design to non-DNA molecules, such as proteins and
enzymes, represents an area of interest and recent development.

Motifs, such as aptamers, can be easily added to other DNA structures,
but their shape response is limited to a specific reaction phenotype.23−25 In a similar manner, DNAzymes use DNA/RNA chimeric sequences and
act as a catalytic reaction center, allowing for the dynamic adjustment
of the structure for both structural rearrangement.26−30 There has been minimal work, however, interacting
DNA structures directly with enzymatic inputs for either sensing or
directed structural rearrangement. Zuo et al. demonstrated a molecular
beacon approach that uses exonuclease to generate an amplified fluorescent
output, but this is neither the sensing target nor a means to structural
change.31 It is our intent to explore the
use of restriction enzymes as a directing molecule for the development
of DNA-based sensors and enzyme-directed machines. We hypothesize
that integration with these enzymes will enable multistep sensing.

Restriction enzymes, also called restriction endonucleases, are
enzymes that cut DNA at specific sequences. Naturally found in bacteria
to defend against viral pathogens, restriction enzymes have been harnessed
by researchers and have proven a powerful asset for use in biotechnology
applications, such as DNA cloning. These enzymes typically recognize
sequences of DNA between 4 and 8 base pairs and can cut double-stranded
DNA in a staggered manner, leaving a single-stranded overhang (sticky
end) or they can cut at the same place on each strand producing a
blunt end.32−34

Our previous efforts with DNA sensors produced
a multiarm switch
that enabled a logic-capable photonic output for three simultaneous
single-stranded DNA targets.35 Linkers
joining the arms can be added or removed by the addition of specific
DNA sequences. This switch uses a base set of arms, each of which
contains the molecular dye. From this base, the switch can be assembled
with a range of different dyes and different linker lengths to produce
a vast range of optical output.36 This
modularity makes it an ideal candidate to explore restriction enzyme-enabled
sensing and rearrangement. Although we have explored many dye triads
as well as structural modification, to date, only DNA inputs have
been used to modify the optical response. In this work, we investigate
the role of restriction endonuclease to modulate our three-dye optical
network. We test six different restriction enzymes with both sticky
and blunt-end cleavage types and combine three of these into a single
device capable of detecting rearrangement via single, double, and
triple enzymatic digestion. The cleavage also results in the release
of a seven base toehold, which we demonstrate can be used for the
one-pot rearrangement and inclusion of a Cy5-containing DNA.

Results
Structural
Design
The three-arm switch, detailed in
previous publications,35,36 was used as a basis for the underlying
design of the enzyme-responsive DNA structure. This DNA-based structure
positions three covalently linked fluorescent dyes and utilizes their
overlapping excitation and emission profiles to form a Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) triad that is responsive to changes
in distance between each of the three fluorophores. This structure
provides the demonstrated ability to detect three separate targets
within one device, thus enabling complex detection.35 The underlying DNA structure consists of three double-crossover
junctions formed by an arm strand annealed with a capping strand with
a molecular dye covalently attached at the central end position of
the arm strand. Each of these crossovers represents one of three arms,
Arm1, Arm2, or Arm3, and are linked together via DNA linkers, which
position the attached dyes into the FRET triad.

The controlling
element in the device is the presence of an intact linker strand,
which brings the dyes into proximity and turns on the FRET interaction.
In Buckhout-White et al.,35 the linkers
used were single-stranded and could be removed through toehold-mediated
strand displacement, thus rendering this device a DNA sensor. With
our goal to move into more complex, non-DNA targets, we have modified
the original design of the linkers to include a double-stranded recognition
sequence for restriction enzymes. This modification uses the basic
structure detailed above, including the three-arm crossover structures,
but replaces the single-stranded linker with a 10 base pair double-stranded
linker, a long linker strand with a short 10 base compliment strand,
which serves as the cleavage site. The overall structure is depicted
in Figure 1A.

Figure 1 (A) Schematic
of the DNA switch structure and mechanism for rearrangement
via enzymatic cleavage: (i) partial structure schematic indicating
the arms and cleavage site. Each of these structures contains two
molecular dyes, and the cleavage is transduced by simple FRET behavior;
(ii) full three-arm structure, which contains three dyes and is transduced
through examining each of the three acceptor-to-donor ratios. The
linker between each arm of the structure is a 10 base double-stranded
DNA and is coded to be a cleavage site for a specified restriction
enzyme. The cleavage of one or more of these linker regions allows
for the separation of the fluorescent dyes, which reduced the output
of the donor-to-acceptor ratio. (B) Sequence of one of three linker
sequences with the restriction site in bold and the cutting location
indicated by the triangles. (C) Emission and excitation profiles of
the Cy3, Cy3.5, and Cy5 molecular dyes. (D) Spectral overlap of these
dyes form the basis of the multi-FRET-based optical output.

The modularity of the switch design
allows for the structure to
be assembled partially such that only two dye-containing arms are
present, connected by one linker containing the recognition area,
thus greatly simplifying the structure to allow for iterative analysis
of the individual components. The partial structure used for testing
each enzyme independently is depicted in Figure 1A,i, which shows one of the three dye pairs
that can be formed using the partial structure: Cy3–Cy5, Cy3–Cy3.5,
and Cy3.5–Cy5. The rearrangement induced by the cleavage from
the restriction enzyme is shown on the full three-arm structure in Figure 1A,ii. The same process
would proceed on the partial structure except the two arms would fully
dissociate as no remaining DNA is left to bind the structure.

Each linker region is coded with a recognition site for a unique
restriction enzyme. Six enzymes in total were tested: XbaI, EcoRI, BamHI, NcoI, SmaI, and XhoI. Figure 1B shows the sequences of all
six restriction enzymes that were tested. Of these enzymes, XhoI, EcoRI, and SmaI
were found to work in concert within a fully assembled switch. The
bold portion of the sequence represents the restriction site, and
the arrows indicate the cutting location. As can be seen in Figure 1B, we investigated
both blunt-end cleavage and sticky-end cleavage. The sequences and
melting temperatures for all oligos are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI).

The transduction
functionality of this switch is based on the cyclic
FRET behavior of three spectrally overlapping and closely spaced molecular
dyes. This is discussed in detail in Buckhout-White et al.35 The dye triad used for these studies were Cy3,
Cy3.5, and Cy5. Figure 1C shows the excitation and emission curve for each dye, and the spectral
overlap is shown in Figure 1D. The Förster distance, the distance which corresponds
to a theoretical 50% transfer efficiency, is 5.3 nm for Cy3–Cy3.5,
5.4 nm for Cy3–Cy5, and 6.0 nm for Cy3.5–Cy5. For the
original work, a spacing of nine bases, or ∼3 nm, would have
theoretically yielded ∼95% efficiency. In practice, we measured
30% efficiency, which was sufficient to demonstrate change in the
full three-arm configuration. This 10 base linker will have a 3.5
nm spacing, but will reduce some of the torsional contribution given
the spacing is on par with the length of one full helical turn of
DNA. As such, we expect similar performance from this configuration.

Although the activity of restriction enzymes is well documented
and their use considered routine for many genetic engineering protocols,
our application explores the limits of double-stranded DNA size and
temperature conditions, for which these enzymes are optimized. To
retain the close proximity of the dye molecules in the uncut “off”
state, it is necessary to minimize the total length of the double-stranded
linker. The recognition sites of many restriction enzymes, including
those we worked with, are six bases, and linkers were designed to
include two additional bases on either side of the recognition site.
According to the enzyme manufacturers, it is recommended to include
a minimum of six37 additional bases flanking
the restriction site for optimal enzyme performance. The 10 base double-stranded
linker is formed using a 10 base compliment to the single-stranded
linker strand and thus naturally has a melting temperature ranging
from 41.5 to 57.7 °C. The melt temperature defines the point
at which half of the DNA is single-stranded. With 41.5 °C being
the low range, we prefer that the enzyme be able to work at room temperature.
Although several restriction enzymes, including SmaI, cut their recognition site at room temperature (25 °C), most
restriction enzymes perform optimally at 37 °C. Due to the requirement
that the enzymes function at room temperature and cut a 10 base pair
DNA linker, it was critical to be able to test each restriction enzyme
independently to determine which would function under these nonideal
conditions.

Single-Enzyme Cleavage
Partial structures
containing
two arms and a single recognition sequence were used to assess the
ability of each enzyme to cleave the 10 base pair linker at room temperature.
The activity of each of the six enzymes, XhoI, NcoI, SmaI, XbaI, BamHI, and EcoRI, was compared against
a positive and a negative control. The negative control comprised
the partial structure without any enzyme present. This represents
the condition with no enzymatic cleavage of the linker. The positive
control is an approximation of a full cleavage by the enzyme and is
represented experimentally by forming structures that lack the linker
connecting the two dye-containing arms. The restriction enzymes XbaI, XhoI, NcoI, and SmaI were tested using the Arm1–Cy3, Arm2–Cy3.5
partial structure. EcoRI was tested using the Arm2–Cy3.5,
Arm3–Cy5 partial structure, and SmaI and BamHI were tested using the Arm1–Cy3, Arm3–Cy5
partial structure. For all enzymes that were considered, five enzymes
in four unique combinations emerged, showing ideal cutting behavior
and no nonspecific cutting behavior in the presence of a nontargeted
enzyme. Of the four combinations, NcoI-BamHI-XhoI, NcoI-EcoRI-XhoI, XhoI-SmaI-BamHI, and XhoI, EcoRI-SmaI, the latter was chosen to perform the full
structured variations.

Figure 2A shows the analyzed fluorescent data, whereas Figure 2B shows the gel electropherogram.
For each of the characterization methods, the samples were prepared
in the same way in parallel runs with the positive and negative controls.
The positive control solution was annealed according to the protocol
specified in the Methods section in a batch
large enough for 24, 20 μL sample to be produced. This sample
contained equal molar ratios of each of two dye-containing arm strands
and their corresponding capping strands as well as the linker and
the compliment to the linker, which provides for the double-stranded
cleavage site all in the provided CutSmart buffer. With CutSmart being
a nonstandard buffer for DNA formation, a formation analysis was performed
prior to begin the enzyme cutting and can be seen in the Supporting
Information (SI) (Figure S1). Each of these
samples was aliquoted into a 384-well plate in triplicate, where 2
μL of the specified enzyme was added and then mixed by gentle
pipetting. For the negative control, the solution was annealed separately
without the linker strand or its compliment. Both the positive control
and negative control added 2 μL of buffer to account for the
volume of the absent enzyme. The samples were allowed to digest for
1 h minimum before measuring the fluorescent output. All fluorescent
measurements were excited at a wavelength of 515 nm, consistent with
the shoulder of the Cy3 excitation peak and recorded between 530 and
800 nm. These parameters were set as such to allow for consistent
readout once all three dyes were used in the full system. The samples
for the gel electrophoresis were taken from the plate after the fluorescent
data were obtained and mixed with the gel-loading buffer before pipetting
the samples into the 3% agarose gel.

(A) Ratios of the acceptor
dye over the donor dye photoluminescence (PL) peak values. The three
plots shown each represent a different programmed sequence designed
for the enzyme specified. Each sequence was tested against six different
enzymes with a negative, no enzyme, and positive, no linker, control.
(B) Gel electropherogram on the partial structure before and after
introduction of the specific enzyme.

To assess the efficacy of the cleavage via fluorescence,
the maximum
value of the deconstructed area of the acceptor peak in each of the
dye pair is divided by the deconstructed donor peak maximum. XhoI and SmaI were initially analyzed using
the Arm1–Cy3, Arm2–Cy3.5 partial structure and thus
the ratio shown for these constructs is Cy3.5/Cy3. For EcoRI, the Arm2–Cy3.5, Arm3–Cy5 partial structure was
used and the ratio is thereby Cy5/Cy3.5. These fluorescent PL ratios
are plotted in Figure 2A for the three enzymes chosen for the triad assembly. The data for
the enzymes not selected and the table showing all possible dye triads
can be seen in the SI (Figure S2 and Table S2). The gray bars, first and last, in Figure 2A, represent the controls for each system,
with the negative control indicating the maximum value for no enzyme
activity and the positive control approximating a complete cleavage
of the linker. All enzymes are shown, and based on fluorescent data
alone, it is clear that these three enzymes show cutting behavior
when presented with the specified enzyme and show no cutting behavior
when presented with the nonspecified enzyme. It is of note that the
value of the specified enzyme does not quite reach the value of the
negative control. This may be due to a very small amount of incomplete
digestion or may just reflect the fact that the negative control is
an approximation because no portion of the linker or compliment is
present.

Figure 2B shows
the gel migration of the control sample as well as the specified enzyme
digestion for the partial switch structure. The primary band at about
240 bp according to the ladder represents the fully formed structure.
Once the enzyme is added, this band increases its migration consistent
with 150 bp, roughly half. The intensity of the band also increases
due to the doubling of the mass of DNA at that specific size. There
is a small remnant of the full-structure band that is consistent with
the thought that we are getting close to but not 100% digestion of
these structures. This may also be a result of potential rehybridization
of the sticky ends, or reassociation of the blunt ends that occur
after the cleavage. In all, both characterization methodologies support
the same conclusion that these three enzymes exhibit good cleavage
with little to no nonspecific activity.

Kinetics of Enzyme Activity
With the activity confirmed,
we assessed the kinetic rate of the enzymatic cleavage. To reiterate,
these enzymes are demonstrating cleavage under nonideal conditions.
The cleavage for all experiments occurs at room temperature, with
most of these enzymes optimized for 37 °C. The cleavage site
is also contained on a 10 base oligo with three-way junctions at both
ends of that oligo. For these enzymes, it is recommended that there
be a minimum of six37 base pairs on either
side of the cleave site. Figure 3 shows the kinetic curves produced by measuring the
same acceptor-to-donor ratio for each of the partial structures. This
measurement was recorded every 20 min, with the exception of the first
time point, which occurred 10 min after the initial plating. The black
bars flanking the curves are averaged values of controls, positive,
and negative, taken over the entire time. The variations in position
of the positive and negative controls are directly due to the photophysical
properties of the dyes in each system. The sharp line in the EcoRI indicated that full cleavage occurs within the 10
min time frame between initial plating and the addition and mixing
of the enzyme.

cleavage.
The top line in each plot represents the average of the positive control,
and the bottom line is the average of the negative control.

Three-Arm Switch Performance
With the three enzymes
determined to operate efficiently in the partial structure, we placed
the three chosen enzymes’ recognition sequences into each of
the three linker regions; XhoI in linker 1 between
Cy3 and Cy3.5, EcoRI in linker 2 between Cy3.5 and
Cy5, and SmaI in linker 3 between Cy3 and Cy5. Using
the cutting of one linker as an input, we find eight potential permutations
for the full three-arm switch. This is equivalent to the same eight
potential permutations in Buckhout-White et al.35 The difference with the enzyme switch is the fragments
of the cleaved linker is still present whereas the linker removal
via strand displacement from the previous work, removes the entire
sequence. The corollary between these two systems allows us to provide
a set of positive controls such that we are mimicking the cleavage
of one, two, or three of the linkers by removing the linker altogether.

To test the three-arm switch, we created a series of single, double,
and triple digestions and compared them with the corresponding linker-removed
structures. For example, the corollary to XhoI presence
would be the removal of linker 1. For this series, we used XhoI single digestion, EcoRI single digestion, XhoI and EcoRI double digestion, and then
the final XhoI EcoRI and SmaI triple digestion. For the three-arm structure, the
FRET pathways are all interrelated and it is necessary to examine
all three acceptor-to-donor ratios to get a full understanding of
the spectral output. Figure 4 displays the acceptor-to-donor ratios for the enzyme digestion
(A) and the linker-removed corollaries (B). Comparison shows general
agreement between the two sets. As expected from the partial structure
digestions, we do not fully reach the level of the positive controls.
This again may be due to partial cutting, reassembly of the cut end,
or inherent anomalies between a fully cut structure and the linker-removed
version. It may also be due to the amount of glycerol in the system
from the double and triple digestions. We chose to keep all variables
constant, which meant the amount of glycerol inserted into the system
was 10% for the double digestion and 15% for the triple digestion.
Although this does not eliminate the desired reaction, it may limit
completion of the reaction or full rearrangement of the structure.
If we look at the trends of each ratio between samples, we see that
in the case of the Cy3.5/Cy3 ratio the value decreases slightly, increases,
and then subsequently decreases in the next two samples. All ratios
follow the same trends with the exception of the Cy5/Cy3.5 ratio between
the negative control and the XhoI enzyme addition.
Here, the value roughly stays level in the enzyme sample and increases
in the control. These similar trends can also be seen if we plot the
dye contribution as a percentage of the total area. The ternary plot
shown in Figure S3 displays this presentation.

Figure 4 Plots
of the three acceptor-to-donor ratios for each of the full
three-arm structures. (A) Single-, double-, and triple-enzyme digest
for the three-arm structures. (B) Comparable control structures in
which a linker is removed where the corresponding enzyme structure
would be cleaved.

Structural Rearrangement
One added benefit of the 10
base length of the recognition site compliment is that upon the sticky-end
cleavage realized by both the XhoI and EcoRI enzymes we are left with a 7 base, 3 base split of the 10 base
sequence. The three bases that remain of the linker strands do not
have a sufficient melt temperature to allow this duplex to remain
stable and thus the seven bases of the compliment dissociate into
solution. The same is true of the other side where the three bases
of the compliment do not have the energy to remain associated with
the seven base linker strand. This end thereby leaves a seven base
strand that is now suitable as a toehold for additional structural
modification. This process is depicted schematically in Figure 5A. It is important to note
that this toehold only exists after the restriction enzyme has fully
cleaved the target sequence.

Figure 5 (A) Schematic illustration of the partial structure
enzyme cleavage
and rearrangement via addition of an additional Cy5-containing DNA
oligo. (B) PL Intensity of each of the structures depicted in (A),
with XhoI + oligo and XhoI + bridge
both being one-pot reactions. (C) PL peak height plots for each of
the three dyes in the system. The addition was performed both as a
one-pot reaction and a sequential reaction. The controls of the switch
plus the oligo or bridge are done in the absence of enzyme and show
little to no reaction without the presence of the enzyme.

To utilize this toehold display, we have formed
the three-arm structure
in full and partial form, with only the Cy3 and Cy3.5 dyes present
on Arm1 and Arm2, respectively. For the full structure, Arm3 is present
but in an unlabeled form to preserve the structural integrity but
allow for the use of the Cy5 dye for our new addition. For this reconfiguration,
we have designed two versions of a Cy5-labeled DNA that will interact
with the exposed toehold. The oligo version is a simple single-stranded
DNA of 15 bases with a Cy5 that will have the closest interaction
with the Cy3. The bridge version is a partially duplex DNA with two
identical binding regions that will bridge two of the three arm switches
together. This is depicted in the bottom panel of Figure 5A.

Figure 5B shows
the spectra of the original partial two-arm structure, the structure
with the XhoI enzyme added, XhoI
plus the bridge DNA, and XhoI plus the oligo DNA.
In comparing the XhoI spectra to that where either
the bridge or the oligo is added, there is a clear decrease in the
Cy3 peak at 550 nm and a clear increase in the Cy5 peak at 650 nm.
This change alone shows the inclusion of the new oligo, thus demonstrating
the ability to modify the structure after the enzymatic cleavage has
taken place.

Figure 5C shows
further analysis in which each of the three acceptor-to-donor ratios
is plotted. The control is shown in section I and is derived from
the data from “original” in Figure 5B. Section II shows two controls where the
oligo and the bridge are added to the control without enzyme. For
the bridge structure, we see no increase in Cy5, but for the oligo
structure, we see a slight increase in the Cy5 excitation, indicating
some leakage. Section III is where XhoI is added,
and we see the clear increase in the Cy3 excitation. For sections
IV and V, we distinguished between a sequential addition method, where
the enzyme is added to the full structure and allowed to cleave and
then either the bridge or the oligo is added, and the one-pot addition,
where the oligo or bridge and the enzyme are added simultaneously.
In each case, the oligo or bridge is added in a 4-fold molar excess
to the switch. For the sequential addition, we see minor increase
from the oligo Cy5/Cy3 excitation signal but similar values with the
other two ratios. For the one-pot addition, the bridge addition shows
slight decrease in both the Cy5/Cy3 signal and the Cy3.5/Cy3 signal.
Although the lower Cy5/Cy3 signal indicates a potentially lower rate
of binding, the lower Cy3.5/Cy3 ratio may mean more disruption of
the Cy3–Cy3.5 transfer. In all, this may be a direct result
of the bridge molecule having asymmetric dye position of the Cy5.

Discussion and Conclusions
In this work, we utilized the
inherent fit with restriction endonuclease
to expand the range of detectable materials outside of the realm of
simple DNA. We have clearly demonstrated the ability of a three-arm
switch to be applied to enzymatic inputs. Furthermore, we have demonstrated
that these enzymes can be used to rearrange the structure of the DNA,
allowing multistep processes to occur, a necessary step toward the
evolution of complex sensing. In investigating the use of restriction
enzymes in this confined parametric space, we have also demonstrated
the ability of these materials to engage effectively outside their
optimal environment. We see no difference in cleavage rate between
that of blunt-end- and sticky-end-type cleavage sites. In the steady-state
measurement, we see no distinction in the cleavage efficiency between
these cleavage types either. However, in the kinetic assay, the SmaI enzyme, a blunt-end restriction enzyme, completes the
reaction with a higher ratio, indicating less complete cleavage than
the control compared to either of the other two enzymes, XhoI or EcoRI, both of which are sticky-end cleavage
types. This difference may relate to the affinity for the blunt-end
nonspecific adhesion, which is documented in ref (38) or may be an artifact
of the measurement parameter. Further work on a broader array of both
cleavage type enzymes will help alleviate this question and expand
the library of enzymes applicable to this type of activity environment.

We have presented the transfer from the partial structure analysis
to the full-structure analysis and the multiplexing ability that this
brings, as demonstrated by the successful single, double, and triple
digestion. Although these do not reach their full-potential on–off
range as demonstrated by the linker-removed controls, we still see
clear distinction enough to determine which enzymes are acting. As
demonstrated by the unique change particularly seen in the addition
of the EcoRI enzyme, it is possible to determine,
blindly, which enzyme is acting. Improvement on this may be available
through dye change or condition optimization. Further, as a sensing
modality, this multiplexing ability is quite powerful and may not
be limited to simply three enzymes. The modular structure could easily
be made more complex by the addition of arms to the unit. We have
also shown that it can operate distinctly using different dye triads
and that there are several unique combinations of enzymes.36 This means that we may potentially be able to
have two separate switches in solution, each with unique recognition
sites and optical output.

The structural rearrangement offers
perhaps the most unexpected
outcome of this work. As a byproduct of restriction enzyme cleavage
of the target DNA, we reveal an active DNA toehold. Multistep reactions
are not new within the field of DNA nanotechnology. Concentric FRET
systems based on protease cleavage and quantum dot assembly show similar
optical performance with regard to multienzyme detection, but they
are limited to simple detection mechanisms.39 Other work demonstrates the ability to interact with an existing
structure and expose a toehold that will continue the reaction in
a prescribed manner.40−42 Our present demonstration, however, shows the clear
ability of enzyme-directed chain reactions within a confined structural
environment. This is evidenced by the appearance of the Cy5 excitation
peak, which is not seen in either the control or the original structure.
The effect seen in both the sequential and one-pot demonstrations
further demonstrates that the secondary rearrangement with the toehold
is only activated once the enzymatic cleavage has occurred.

With such little leakage seen, this simple demonstration portends
to much greater potential application. The harnessing of multienzyme,
multistep assemblies could have an impact on the fields of DNA nanorobotics
and enzyme-directed nanofabrication. Within the context of complex
sensing and theranostics, it is also conceivable that these systems
may be adapted to a larger cagelike structure that upon interaction
with the target enzymes can release payload or rearrangement to deliver
targeted DNA codons.

In all, we have expanded the utility of
the logic FRET-enabled
three-arm DNA switch to the detection of restriction enzymes. We have
shown six different enzymes in all and three enzymes in detail. These
three enzymes have clear cleavage efficiency and no nonspecific cleavage,
a necessary requirement for this three-target system to function.
We have demonstrated single, double, and triple digestions with clear
photonic distinction in the output, a necessary criterion to determine
which enzymes are present. Finally, we show the ability of these enzymes
to be used as triggers for site-specific rearrangement of these DNA
structures, which may have broad-reaching potential for complex sensing
and smart nanoscale systems.

Methods
DNA
The DNA sequences
are based on Buckhout-White et
al.35 with the exception of the linker
sequences, which are designed to include cleavage sites for the specified
restriction enzymes. All unlabeled and Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA are
synthetic oligos ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville,
IA). The Cy3.5-containing oligos are sourced from Eurofins genomics
(Louisville, KY). The oligos used were diluted to 20 μM working
concentrations in water and analyzed for concentration using Thermo
Fisher NanoDrop 2000.

Structural Assembly
All of the partial
and full structures
were assembled in a total volume of 80 μL with a 0.5 μM
concentration unless specified otherwise. A small volume of 2 μL
of each 20 μM DNA oligo was added to form either the partial
or full structures. The CutSmart (New England Biolabs) buffer (8 μL)
was used in each 80 μL sample unless specified otherwise. Each
80 μL sample was annealed on a ProFlex Thermal cycler using
a program that heats the sample up to 95 °C for 5 min and is
ramped down 1 °C every minute until 4 °C, at which temperature
it is held.

Enzyme Digestion
All enzymes used
(BamHI, EcoRI, NcoI, SmaI, XbaI, and XhoI) were from New
England Biolabs and had a concentration of 20 000 U/mL. The
high-fidelity versions of the enzymes BamHI, EcoRI, and NcoI were employed in the experiments.
Single-enzyme digestions were conducted by inserting 1 μL of
enzyme for every 10 μL of sample and gently mixing via repeated
pipetting. Multienzyme digestions were conducted using the same DNA-to-enzyme
ratio for each individual enzyme, with 1 μL of each enzyme per
10 μL volume of sample, i.e., three enzyme digest will contain
3 μL of enzyme solution per 10 μL of total solution volume.
The solutions then sat out in a room-temperature environment for a
minimum of 1 h prior to analysis.

Structural Rearrangement
For the structural rearrangement
studies, Cy5 oligo and Cy5 bridge were prepared in a 20 μM dilution
in the CutSmart buffer and annealed using the same thermal ramp protocol
used to assemble the switch structure. A small volume of 1 μL
of this preannealed solution was used for each addition, which represents
a 4-fold molar excess to the assembled structure. The oligo is allowed
to react with the switch structure at room temperature for a minimum
of 10 min.

FRET Data Collection and Analysis
Fluorescence data
were collected using the Tecan Infinite M100 dual monochromator multifunction
plate reader that has a xenon flash lamp (Tecan, Research Triangle
Park, NC). A small volume of 20 μL of each 0.5 μM concentration
sample was inserted into a single well in a 384-well plate. All of
the samples were run in triplicate unless otherwise specified. The
DNA dye-labeled samples were excited at 515 nm. The data were recorded
over an emission ranging from 530 to 800 nm. The raw data were deconstructed
using model Cy3, Cy3.5, and Cy5 emission spectra. The maximum peak
value of each spectra corresponding to 556, 606, and 664 nm was used
to produce the donor-to-acceptor ratio values.

Gel Electrophoresis Data
Collection and Analysis
Three
percent agarose gels made with 1× tris acetate EDTA buffer were
used to collect the gel electrophoresis data unless otherwise indicated.
For every 100 mL of gel solution, 20 μL of GelRed stain (Biotium;
Fremont, CA) was used. A DNA ladder (BioMarker EXT Plus, Bioventures
Inc; Murfreesboro, TN) was used to determine the length of the double-stranded
DNA bands. A volume of 10 μL of a 12 μL sample that consisted
of 10 μL of digested sample (or control) and 2 μL of a
loading dye was loaded into each well; 6 μL of ladder was inserted
into one well that consisted of 5 μL of ladder and 1 μL
of loading dye unless otherwise indicated. Each gel experiment was
run at 80 V for 1 h. The Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ System was used to
analyze the gel electrophoresis data.
