Metal-phthalocyanines
are quasi-planar heterocyclic macrocycle
molecules with a highly conjugated structure. They can be engineered
at the molecular scale (central atom, ligand) to tailor new properties
for organic spintronics devices. In this study, we evaluated the magnetic
behavior of FePc in a ∼1 nm molecular film sandwiched between
two ferromagnetic films: cobalt (bottom) and nickel (top). In the
single interface, FePc in contact with a Co film is magnetically coupled
with the inorganic film magnetization, though the relatively small
Fe(Pc) X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) signal in remanence,
with respect to that observed in applied field of 6 T, suggests that
a fraction of molecules in the organometallic film have their magnetic
moment not aligned or antiparallel with respect to Co. When in contact
with two interfaces, Fe(Pc) XMCD doubles, indicating that part of
the Fe(Pc) are now aligned with the Ni topmost layer, saturated at
1 T. We discussed the relevance of the finding in terms of understanding
and developing hybrid organic/inorganic spin devices.

Introduction
A spin-valve is a layered
structure consisting of two ferromagnetic
(FM) electrodes of different coercivity decoupled by a spacer and
displaying a resistance that depends on the spin state of electrons
that pass through it (magnetoresistance). The π-conjugated organic
semiconductors are interesting as spin devices due to their intrinsic
lattice flexibility and long range spin coherence. Two types
of organic spin valves have been designed displaying the organic layer
sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes either aligned
vertically1,2 or horizontally3. Spin polarization and transmission at distances in the range
of tens of nanometers from an injection organic/FM interface have
been observed in NiFe 17 nm/LiF 1.9 nm/Alq3 200 nm/TPD
50 nm/FeCo 17 nm by muon spin rotation4 and in the Co/CuPc interface by two-photon photoemission spectroscopy.5 These results indicate π-conjugated organic
semiconductors as a promising spacer for spintronic devices. However,
the understanding of how and which organic materials to incorporate
in spintronic devices still requires careful examination in spite
of intensive investigation, and that is the reason why several experimental
and theoretical works have been focused on the characterization of
single organic molecule/FM interfaces.

Paramagnetic organometallic
molecules are good candidates for designing
a robust organic/inorganic interface. In particular, flat molecules
like metal-phthalocyanine (MPc) have the advantage of self-assembling
in a well-organized structure on metal surfaces, i.e., reducing the
structural defect and increasing charge mobility. MPc films exhibit
a semiconductor behavior with a gap (highest occupied and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital, HOMO–LUMO gap) that ranges from 1 to 1.6
eV depending on the central metal atom.6 Their magnetic properties depend on the crystallographic structure
and the metal distance within the film lattice. In the case of CoPc,
some studies revealed an antiferromagnetic coupling between Co atoms
of different CoPc chains within α and β crystallographic
phases, as well as in template thin film grown on flexible polymeric
substrates7 or Pb islands.8

Differently, a iron phthalocyanine (FePc) film grown
flat on gold
surfaces is paramagnetic (ferromagnetic) above (below) ∼4.5
K.9 These examples point out that MPc thin
films can be thought of as a semiconductor endowed with quantum spin
chains and consequently functional for designing organic spintronics
device.7 Up to now, Co/MPc interface was
identified as a promising spin-polarized current source at room temperature
(RT).10 The robust magnetism of the Co/MnPc
interface has been observed to favor the manganese phthalocyanine
(MnPc) antiferromagnetic ordering within subsequent layers at room
temperature and the induction of exchange bias at low temperature.11

Magnetoresistance transport experiments
have been performed in
molecular magnetic tunnel junctions based on CoPc showing an inverse
tunnel magnetoresistance in Co/CoPc/Co and a unidirectional anisotropy
at the interface due to asymmetric coupling between nominally equivalent
Co/CoPc interfaces.12 Due to the complexity
of the structure and the magnetic phase for MPc, further studies are
required to understand the feasibility of integrating MPc film as
a component of vertical hybrid organic spin-valve.

The formation
and characterization of ferromagnetic films based
on organic interfaces are being widely studied and different attempts
to improve the response of spin organic devices are done by using
alkali metals in the molecular matrix13 and organic ferromagnetic layers instead of metallic,14 among others.

In a recent research paper,12 the authors
discuss as promising the fabrication of nanodevices in a vertical
structure consisting of Co/CoPc/Co and its magneto-transport properties.
On the other hand, in other work,15 the
Co film formation on top of an Alq3 film gives rise to
an ill-defined metal film with a direct influence on the magneto-transport
properties of the prototypical device.

The aim of our paper
is to investigate the formation of a metallic
FM layer on top of an organic thin film (FePc) by measuring the magnetic
response of the system by means of element-specific experimental techniques,
with particular focus on the role of molecular thin film as a spacer
between two FM inorganic films.

Thin cobalt and nickel films
are ferromagnetic at room temperature,
displaying coercivity of 0.05 and 0.025 T, respectively; the latter
depending on thin film thickness.16 Co
spin polarization has been reported to be 20%,17 whereas Ni has a maximum spin polarization of >46%.18 We intend to disclose the following relevant
issues: (i) the chemical interaction between the organic molecular
film (FePc) and the atop FM layers; (ii) the role of the bottom
FM film in the FePc film growth and its magnetic response; and (iii)
the properties of FePc film when in contact with two inorganic ferromagnetic
films.

The investigation has been carried out by means of X-ray
spectroscopies:
photoemission (XPS), absorption (XAS), and magnetic circular dichroism
(XMCD). Because of the element specificity of these experimental techniques,
we could follow the evolution of core-level line shape of all the
elements present in the grown heterostructure from the top Ni film
through the organic FePc semiconductor film to the bottom Co layer,
as well as the absorption edges features modifications in the presence
of an external magnetic field or in remanence after the magnetization
saturation. Particular emphasis was given on the FePc magnetic
moment alignment with the bottom and top FM films.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
the C 1s and N 1s photoemission line shape evolution of FePc (3 nm)/Co
(1.4 nm)/Cu(100), hereafter FePcCo, upon Ni deposition. The quality
of the Ni/FePc interface is probed as a function of nickel film thickness:
2, 3, 4 nm. In the C 1s core-level signal of the pristine FePcCo film,
two components are identified with intensity ratio and energy position
corresponding to benzene CB and pyrrole CP,
being the signature of the FePc molecule. The N 1s spectrum presents
a single feature and its satellite corresponding to the molecular
N sites not resolved in the spectra. After the first nickel deposition,
there is an upshift of the C 1s and N 1s spectra of ∼0.6 eV
and a change of their spectral shape with the appearance of a shoulder
at lower binding energies (BE). The latter corresponds to C and N
atoms bound with nickel atoms, C–Ni and N–Ni (Figure 1a,b). The spectral
shift after metal deposition can be attributed to the formation of
an interface dipole19 or an incomplete
core–hole screening of small metal clusters.20 To have further insight into N and C environments, we performed
XPS measurements of Ni (4 nm)/FePc (3 nm)/Co (1.4 nm)/Cu(100), NiFePcCo,
at grazing and normal emission as reported in the bottom panels of Figure 1d,e to probe the
sample at different depths. C 1s and N 1s are normalized to the most
intense feature. The C–Ni and N–Ni peaks decrease going
from normal to grazing emission geometry, indicating that the Ni-derived
features are detected at different depths with respect to the Ni film
top surface. This behavior can be interpreted in terms of both interface
roughness or Ni diffusion in the molecular matrix (Supporting Information) of the order of ∼5 Å. Figure 1f illustrates a cartoon
picture of the formed heterostructure.

eV.

The magnetic properties of NiFePcCo
layers are strictly connected
to the electronic distribution close to the Fermi edge (EF). Figure 1g shows
the valence band of Co, FePcCo, and NiFePcCo films measured at 480
eV. The valence bands of the bottom and top films are characterized
by 3d–4s band close to the Fermi edge; in the panel of Co film,
the residual contribution of the Cu substrate is highlighted by gray
shadow area. The valence band of the FePc film is dominated by the
highest occupied molecular state, HOMO, at BE of 0.7 eV and other
molecular states at higher BE of 3.3 and 5.1 eV. All molecular features
disappear and Ni density of states is predominant in the vicinity
of the Fermi level after Ni deposition. This is due to difference
in both Ni coverage and photoelectron cross sections (σNi ≫ σN, σC, see the Supporting Information).

Figure 2a,b shows
the N 1s-π* and Fe 2p–3d transition of the FePcCo sample
before and after Ni deposition measured at 45°, which shows similar
trend as a function of Ni thickness as acquired at 0° (not shown).
The null X-ray linear dichroism of the thick molecular film suggests
that molecules of the upper layers are randomly oriented with respect
to the substrate surface plane (the opposite is expected for the monolayer
or sub-monolayer coverage, details in the Supporting Information).

(gray shadow)
and after (light cyan curve) Ni deposition. (c) Ni L2,3 XAS spectra vs Ni thickness. Hysteresis loops related to Co (d)
and Ni films (e) obtained by recording the L3 intensity
as a function of magnetic field applied along the [1̅10] direction
of Cu(100) substrate. All measurements were performed at room temperature.

The XAS spectra of the FePcCo
film present the characteristic features
of two N sites, N1 and N2, at 396.7 and 397.1
eV, respectively, for the N K-edge (gray shadow curve in Figure 2a) and 3d anisotropic
electronic distribution of FePc molecule with a prominent peak at
703 eV for the Fe L3 (shadow gray curve in Figure 2b), in agreement with the already
published results.21 Both N K and Fe L3 XAS spectral line shape broadens after Ni deposition, the
intensity ratio of Fe 3d peaks modifies, and the multiplet structure
is almost lost. The N K absorption edge is not sharp anymore, but
the electronic states are spread across the edge energy. The relative
intensity modifications within the spectral feature is an indicator
of the established interactions with the top layer; in particular,
the reduction of N2 component points to the partial filling
of the corresponding π* molecular orbital and, therefore, an
involvement of this nitrogen state in the interaction with Ni.

The Ni XAS spectra taken at the Ni L2,3 edge show L3/L2 ratio of approximately 1.8 and a feature of
6 eV above the L3 main component that are consistent with
the formation of a metal-like Ni film.22

The Co and Ni L3 XMCD hystereses are obtained by
sweeping
the magnetic field along the [1̅10] direction of the underlying
Cu(100) from −0.05 to 0.05 T, with the photon helicity vector
projection aligned parallel or antiparallel to the magnetization axis
at room temperature (experimental geometry in the Supporting Information).

A null Ni dichroic signal was
observed up to 4 nm; at this thickness,
a signal as low as 0.1% appears along with a magnetization curve that
does not show a clear hysteresis (Figure 2d). On the other hand, a rectangle-like MH curve was observed for Co film (Figure 2e), indicating that a field of 0.05 T is
enough to magnetize the epitaxial Co film at room temperature but
not for inducing the magnetization of the Ni film grown atop the molecular
layer. No XMCD signal has been observed at the Fe L2,3 edges.15

To explore in detail the magnetic behavior
of the FePc film in
the heterostructure, we performed XMCD experiments on similar specimens
exposed to high magnetic field (6 T) and at low temperature (<20
K). To this end, test multilayered structures were prepared such as
FePc (1 nm)/Co (0.5 nm)/Cu(111), indicated hereafter as FePcCo1, and
Ni (0.6 nm)/FePc (1 nm)/Co (0.5 nm)/Cu(111), labeled as NiFePcCo1.
In Figure 3c, we report
Co, Fe XAS and XMCD spectra measured on CoFePc1. The XMCD signal is
normalized to the L3 XAS intensity of average spectra.
Co presents a XMCD signal of ∼65% at the L3 edge.
The spectral line shape shows a typical fine structure of unperturbed
FePc thin film, the XMCD signal is slightly anisotropic (changes as
a function of the incident angle) and has a maximum extent of ∼33%.

A background was subtracted from all XAS spectra. (d) Magnetization
curve of Fe and Co before Ni deposition.

Figure 3d
illustrates
the Co and Fe(Pc) magnetization curves before Ni deposition. A Co
hysteresis curve appears with the usual rectangular shape and a coercive
field (Hc) of 0.05 T, when the X-ray beam
and magnetic field are at θ = 60° from the surface normal.

The FePc hysteresis exhibits a small intensity and an opposite
sign with respect to one of the underlying Co films. It is worth noting
that for the applied magnetic field lower than 0.1 T, almost no Fe(Pc)
paramagnetic moment are aligned at either at room or low temperature.
The magnetization curves of the bottom ferromagnetic film and the
molecular film vs H has been observed and reported
by Gruber et al. to be opposite in sign,3 with an average manganese magnetic moment in the topmost layers
of MnPc that is aligned antiferromagnetically with the bottom FM film.

In the FePcCo1 heterostructure, the Fe magnetization curve is opposite
to the Co one in the low magnetic field region, whereas for higher
magnetic field, it shows a paramagnetic behavior. It is worth remembering
that in the case of 1 nm FePc grown on Co film, we did not characterize
the magnetic behavior of FePc at the interface, thoroughly studied
in ref (23), but only
the magnetic behavior of the whole film interacting with the FM substrate.
Independent of the preparation conditions, FePc in the first layer
in contact with Co film shows ferromagnetic coupling.23 Therefore, the 1 nm FePc thick film grown on Co justifies
the simultaneous presence of either a ferromagnetic contribution,
associated with the first ordered layer in contact with the Co film,
or antiparallel aligned or paramagnetic molecules, associated with
the topmost layers as in ref (3), the latter contribution has a predominant role in the
magnetization curve response in the system considered as a whole.

We note that FePc behavior in FePcCo1 is at variance with respect
to the FePc film grown on metal substrate; in the latter, an intrinsic
FM behavior has been observed in similar (T, H) conditions.9

X-ray absorption
spectra, measured at the Fe and Ni L2,3 edges for NiFePcCo1
multistructure at θ = 0° (top) and
XMCD as a function of θ (bottom), are displayed in Figure 4a,b. The Ni XAS spectra
are fully consistent with metallic film formation24 and Ni XMCD signal is of ∼31% at L3 edge.
The broad Fe L2,3 XAS spectra reflect a band formation,
consistent with the molecular states hybridized with Ni atoms of the
top layer and a ∼65% XMCD at the L3 edge. Co, Fe,
and Ni located in different layers of the sample show no change in
XMCD spectra measured at 6 T as a function of θ, and therefore
absence of anisotropy. The relative alignment of Fe(Pc) with respect
to the two FM films is important for understanding the magnetic response
of the heterostructure. The Fe XMCD spectra before (Figure 3c) and after (Figure 4a) Ni deposition show an attenuation
of Fe L3 XAS due to the Ni top layer that is counterbalanced
by an increase of the Fe XMCD signal (from 30 to 65%) due to an additional
part of the molecular film aligning its magnetic moment to the magnetization
of the top layer.

Figure 4 Ni (0.6 nm)/FePc (1 nm)/Co (0.5 nm)/Cu(111): (a, b) XAS
at θ
= 0° incidence (top panels) and XMCD at θ = 60, 30, and
0° incidence (bottom panels) spectra are measured at L2,3 edge for Fe and Ni. The XMCDs have been acquired at ±6 T for
both photon helicities. (c, d) Individually normalized magnetization
of Co, Fe, and Ni as a function of the applied magnetic field at 20
K. To acquire the magnetization curve, we measure the XMCD intensity
at a single energy, L3 edge for Co, Fe, and Ni at grazing
(θ = 60°) and normal (θ = 0°) incidence.

To evaluate the influence of two
FM layers on the FePc film, we
measured the magnetization curve of Co, Fe(Pc), and Ni by measuring
the helicity-dependent absorption at the L3 edge up to
a field of ±6 T at θ = 60 and 0° (Figure 4c,d). Element-specific hysteresis
loops of Co, Fe(Pc), and Ni layers are rectangular at θ = 60°
and an almost zero remanent field at θ = 0°. In all layers,
the magnetization reaches its saturation value at H = 1 T. Ni and Fe are fully magnetically coupled with a Hc of 0.035 T, whereas Co shows a larger coercive field
of 0.055 T.

To disentangle the contribution of bottom and top
metallic layers
in determining the magnetic properties of FePc thin film, we measured
the XMCD spectra of different test interfaces in remanence, and the
results are shown in Figure 5: (1) FePc (0.4 nm)/Co (1.1 nm),23 (2) Co (0.4 nm)/FePc (1.5 nm), and (3) NiFePcCo1. (1) was measured
in remanence and at RT after magnetization with a field of 0.05 T,
whereas (2) and (3) were acquired after applying a magnetic field
of 6 T along the substrate surface and at 20 K. In the interfaces
(1) and (2), FePc is in contact with only one Co film either at the
bottom or at the top of molecular film. In (2), the FePc thin film’s
thickness is large enough to guarantee negligible electronic interaction
with the underlying Cu substrate, which is also nonmagnetic and optimal
for evaluating the organic film behavior as a function of the top
magnetic layer. Since it is expected for FePc to have paramagnetic
behavior in the absence of magnetic coupling, the Fe XMCD signal observed
in the remanence in sample (2) demonstrates that part of the FePc
molecules aligns with respect to the magnetized Co top layer. The
proportion of Fe atoms aligned to the magnetization of Co film differs
in (1) and (2) due to the number of Fe magnetically active in the
two cases. It has been shown that for thin FePc film grown on Co (1.1
nm)/Cu(001), the Fe(Pc) magnetic signal originates entirely from the
FePc molecules at the interface with Co (first layer), with no contributions
given by molecules present in the layers far from the interface.23

Figure 5 X-ray absorption spectra are acquired at Fe L2,3 edges
with right- and left-circularly polarized X-ray beam at remanence
with magnetization aligned along the sample surface under the applied
magnetic field of 0.05 T (a) and 6 T (b, c). The XMCD results are
the difference in XAS measurements normalized at L3 intensity.
The results are displayed for each interface: (a) FePc (0.4 nm)/Co
(1.1 nm)/Cu(111);23 (b) Co (0.4 nm)/FePc
(1.5 nm)/Cu(111), and (c) Ni (0.6 nm)/FePc (1 nm)/Co (0.5 nm)/Cu(111).
The specific experimental geometry in remanent measurement is illustrated
in each panel.

As a consequence, we
can compare the XMCD results on the FePc in
the double interface, where the molecular film is sandwiched between
Co and Ni layer. The reduction of FePc XMCD signal to approximately
one half in the measurements at remanence with respect to those under
applied magnetic field allows us to estimate the amount of FePc molecules
initially in the paramagnetic phase or possibly antiferromagnetically
coupled with Co film and subsequently aligned with the top layer.

As far as the Ni/FePc/Co double interface is concerned, going along
the sample from bottom to top interface, the strong magnetic alignment
of FePc moment with respect to the bottom Co FM film is blurred by
the presence of the molecules in the uppermost layer that is aligned
either antiferromagnetically with the other molecular layers or is
not polarized, i.e., in paramagnetic phase. When the top interface
is formed, i.e., Ni/FePc, Fe(Pc) magnetic response increases in terms
of XMCD signal as a consequence of the interaction between the organic
topmost layers and the Ni-magnetized film. The extent of Fe XMCD signal,
observed in Figure 5b,c, indicates a substantial independence from the type (Co, Ni)
of the overlayer ferromagnetic film. The interesting point is that
in the presence of two interfaces, the magnetization curve of Fe and
Ni are overlapping, indicating how much the magnetic response of the
FePc molecules is localized to the region where they are in contact
with Ni atoms (inset of Figure 4c). The contact region definition at the interface between
the organic and FM film must play a role in the extent of in-plane
magnetization of Ni thin film (<1 nm) at room temperature. Our
findings are in agreement with the results obtained for the magnetic
coupling of Co film grown on top of Alq3 molecular film,
where the broad definition of the interface affects both the top layer
and molecular film response.15

Conclusions
We prepared a multilayer vertical heterostructure in which FePc
thin film is sandwiched between two metallic films: Co and Ni. The
in situ characterization by means of synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray
spectroscopies pointed out that bottom (FePc/Co) and top (Ni/FePc)
interfaces differ in terms of the contact region definition and their
magnetic behavior. In particular, when the metallic (Ni) film is deposited
on top of the organic one, a chemical shift is observed on the molecular
core level and XAS spectra as a fingerprint of the ongoing interaction.
The so-formed interface requires a thickness of approximately 4 nm
for the top film to magnetically couple with the organics at RT. The
single FePC/Co interface has been shown to have a robust coupling
between the organic layers and the metallic film and stable at room
temperature already with a magnetic field intensity of ∼0.05
T. In the case of metallic films grown on top of the organic one low
temperature (<20 K) and high magnetic field (1 T) are required
to fully polarize the organometallic layers. We evaluated the magnetic
response of each layer by using the XMCD spectra at (Co, Fe, Ni) L2,3 edges for the heterostructure. A careful comparison of
the XMCD measurements carried out on the molecular film at the Fe
L2,3 edges in the presence of applied magnetic field or
in remanence after saturating the sample magnetization in plane allowed
us to estimate that a fraction of molecules (most reasonably the closest
to the interface) interact with the topmost metallic layer (Co and
Ni).

Experimental Details
The experiments were performed using
the equipments available at
DEIMOS (SOLEIL) and APE-IOM-CNR (ELETTRA) synchrotron beamlines. Cu(111)
and Cu(100) single crystals have been used as substrate for the deposition
of Co metal at DEIMOS and APE, respectively, and Cu(110) for the evaporation
of metal–organic films at DEIMOS. We adopted a similar preparation
procedure to clean the crystals surface, i.e., several cycles of Ar+ sputtering and annealing at 700 K, which guaranteed the quality
of surface as verified by low-energy electron diffraction, and XPS
(APE). FePc powders (Sigma-Aldrich) were outgassed in ultra-high vacuum
and sublimated in a base pressure <10–7 Pa, with
a deposition rate of 0.1 nm/min (as monitored in situ by a quartz
microbalance). Co and Ni films were deposited using e-beam evaporators
at a pressure lower than 5 × 10–7 Pa. At APE,
core-level photoemission spectra were collected using a photon energy
of 480 eV with the polarization vector oriented in the scattering
plane including the sample surface normal and the analyzer entrance
slit plane. The photoemitted electrons were collected by a hemispherical
Omicron EA-125 analyzer at normal emission with an overall energy
resolution (light source + analyzer) better than 200 meV. X-ray absorption
(XAS) spectra were recorded by collecting sample current at the N
K edge and Fe L2,3 edges at different angles between the
linearly polarized light and the sample normal.25 The XMCD spectra at Co, Fe, and Ni absorption edges have
been measured in remanence by reversing the photon helicity. In the
setup, an in situ electromagnet applies a pulsed magnetic field of
±0.05 T along one direction in the sample surface plane. At DEIMOS,
XMCD measurements have been carried out in total electron yield mode
on the Co, Fe, and Ni L2,3 absorption edges at ∼4
K with a magnetic field H of 6 T applied along the
X-ray beam direction. We varied the angle between the sample normal
and the X-ray beam (0, 30, and 60°).26,27
