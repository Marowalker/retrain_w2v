Aggregation–dispersion,
charging, and aggregate strength
of Leonardite humic acid (LHA) were investigated in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions as a function of pH and ionic strength
(I). The strength or the withstanding force of aggregates
of humic substances (HSs) against breakage is important because this
force influences the transport and distribution of pollutants and
nutrients along with HSs through the change in the size of HS aggregates
as a transport unit. We observed the dominancy of aggregation of LHA
at high pH than at low pH in every case of CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions. This observation suggests the higher binding efficiency
of these divalent ions at high pH, though there was no obvious relation
with electrophoretic mobility and aggregation of LHA. Further, we
first revealed the numerical value of the strength of HS aggregates
by using a simple experimental setup of aggregate breakup under laminar
converging flow through a capillary tube. The obtained values of the
strength of LHA aggregates were higher in the presence of CaCl2 solution than MgCl2 solution, and the strength
increased with pH. The highest strengths of LHA aggregates in 30 mM
(I) CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions
were around 5.8 and 2.4 nN, respectively, at pH around 9.

Introduction
Humic substances (HSs)
are charged natural organic macromolecules1−3 and are ubiquitous
in soil and water environments.4 HSs have
colloidal properties1,5 and reactive
surface groups5 that interact with different
inorganic ions and/or organic pollutants6,7 coming into
the soils and water bodies from different anthropogenic activities.
HSs in soil and water environments play multifunctional roles such
as transport and distribution of major macro- and micronutrients to
plants and also in the fate and transport of contaminants and pollutants.8,9 The functions of HSs and their interactions with chemicals depend
on the environmental conditions such as pH,10,11 ionic strength,12−15 concentration of HSs themselves,16 temperature,17 and other physical and chemical parameters of
the systems concerned. Some specific physical properties of HSs, especially
the size and aggregation, are affected by the abovementioned chemical
conditions and surface activity.

The size and structure of HSs
in environments are important because
the transport properties of HSs are a strong function of their size.
The HS size, micelle formation, coiled structure, self-assembled character,
and swelling and shrinkage property also depend on pH and salt concentration
of the system. The size of HSs as a transport unit is also strongly
related to their aggregation, which can occur in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Al3+, Eu3+, Sr2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ag+, and so forth.18−26 Hence, the transport phenomena of nutrient ions and pollutants along
with HSs depend on the aggregation–dispersion of HSs themselves27,28 in soil and water environments.8,29−31 Accordingly, the aggregation is influenced by the interaction of
HSs with oppositely charged ions, and their transport is dependent
on the degree of HS aggregation.

Several previous studies described
the aggregation and ion-binding
of HSs in the presence of inorganic divalent cations as a function
of pH and salt concentration.19,20,32,33 The HS aggregation is also influenced
by the hydrophobicity of HSs themselves and the interaction of organic
ions with HSs.34−38 The temperature-induced aggregation and clouding of humic acid solution
have been reported by Shaffer and von Wandruszka (2015).39 Some of the findings have shown that the humic
acid has pronounced aggregation irrespective of the ionic balance
at low pH.19,26,40 Meanwhile, several studies have already focused on the pronounced
aggregation at higher pH values than at low pH.20,41 At this moment, the effect of pH on the HS aggregation remains controversial.

The aggregate strength of HSs is crucial for the fate and transport
of nutrient elements and pollutants because the strength determines
the aggregate size. The higher aggregate strength originating from
stronger forces among the primary particles results in larger aggregate
size after breakage under flow fields. These strong and thus larger
aggregates can settle or deposit and cannot move toward a long distant
waterway in the environment along with the most toxic metals and organic
pollutants. The environmental conditions such as pH and ion concentration
vary along the transport channel and influence the aggregation of
humic acid and its aggregate strength. Considering these situations,
the study of the aggregate strength of HSs under different environmental
conditions is a primary concern of research these days. Some indirect
methods were applied to evaluate the aggregate strength factor of
HS flocs in different media through alternate shear using the breakage
and regrowth study before and after shear.42−46 However, these studies were not able to assess the
numerical value of the strength of HS aggregates under different physical
and chemical conditions relating with the natural environmental factors.
This means that systematic comparisons for providing insights into
the strength of HS aggregates and parameters controlling the strength
are lacking.

Considering the points of view above, we have focused
on the aggregation
and aggregate strength of HSs. The effect of pH, the divalent cation
type, and the concentration of divalent cations on the aggregation
and strength have been explored. To the best of authors’ knowledge,
this is the first report of the novel evaluation of the strength of
HS aggregates as a function of pH in different ionic strengths and
divalent cation types. The findings could be useful to unveil the
mechanisms of HS aggregation in the presence of divalent cations under
different chemical conditions of natural environments. We also believe
that the findings of this study will give a clear idea about evaluating
the effect of specific ions on the strength of humic acid aggregates.
This will motivate further studies about the effect of other organic
and inorganic ions and pollutant interactions with humic acid under
different environmental conditions to evaluate the relation of different
natural forces with the aggregate strength.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Standard Leonardite humic acid (LHA) from
International Humic Substances Society was used in this study. The
LHA powder was dissolved in KOH solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries)
that contained the base amount, which is equivalent or more than the
amount of carboxylic acid groups of LHA.34 Then, a secondary standard (500 mg/L) and the subsequent required
experimental concentration (50 mg/L) of LHA solutions were prepared
by dilution with deionized water (Elix, Millipore).

The divalent
cation salts of CaCl2·2H2O and MgCl2·6H2O (JIS special grade, Wako Pure Chemical
Industries) were used to examine the effect of divalent cation types.
The salt concentrations were from 2 to 30 mM in ionic strength. From
now on, all concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2 in this experiment are expressed in ionic strength (I). CO2-free KOH solution was prepared by following the
method by Sipos et al. (2000).47 In every
new preparation, the salt solutions were filtered (DISMIC 25HP 0.2
μm, Advantec) and degassed. In every measurement of this study,
we used the degassing of all solutions under reduced pressure (GCD-051X,
ULVAC) to avoid CO2 contamination.

Methods
Electrophoretic
Mobility Measurements
We measured the
electrophoretic mobilities of LHA in the presence of both CaCl2 and MgCl2 at 20 °C with a Zetasizer Nano
ZS apparatus (Malvern Instruments). The electrophoretic mobility was
measured at 2, 5, 10, and 30 mM of CaCl2 and 5, 10, and
30 mM of MgCl2 ionic
strength as a function of pH 3–10. HCl (0.01 M, JIS special
grade chemicals, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) and 0.01 M KOH were
used to control the solution pH. The measurements were reproduced
for almost every experimental condition. The secondary solution of
LHA (500 mg/L) was sonicated once for 20 min before each experimental
mixing of all solutions (HCl, KOH, water, Ca/Mg salts solutions, and
LHA). In the whole experimental study of this research, the LHA concentration
was maintained at 50 mg/L. A combination electrode (ELP-035, TOA-DKK)
was used to measure the pH of the solution.

Macroscopic and Microscopic
Observations of Aggregation and
Dispersion
Visual observations through the naked eye for
large aggregates were performed at 50 mg/L of LHA in different ionic
strengths (2–30 mM) of CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions as a function of pH. For this purpose, a series of 5 mL
solutions of 50 mg/L LHA with 2–30 mM ionic strengths of CaCl2 and MgCl2 at pH 3–10 were prepared in the
prewashed and screw-capped polystyrene bottles. After mixing all solutions,
the bottles were turned over from the upright to normal position once
and then left to stand for 24 h. The macroscopic pictures of the LHA
suspensions in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions were
taken for the affirmation of the aggregation at different pH values
and ionic strengths. Microscopic observations of the LHA–Ca
and LHA–Mg aggregates were also performed using a microscope
(Shimadzu BA210E, Moticam 580INT) after 24 h of the experimental setup.
The purpose of this microscopic study was to explore the tentative
size and aggregate arrangements under different pH and salt conditions.

Converging Flow Generation and Breakup of Aggregates
To
obtain the strength of LHA aggregates, the aggregates were broken
in a converging flow into a glass capillary. A schematic diagram of
the experimental setup for the breakage of aggregates by the converging
flow is illustrated in Figure 1. Sonntag & Russel (1987),48 Higashitani et al. (1991),49 Blaser (2000
a,b),50,51 and Kobayashi (2005)52 also used similar experimental setups to discuss the strength
of flocs by the breakup.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the converging flow
generation and breakage
of aggregates under converging flow (the zoomed section).

A glass capillary of 0.8 mm inner diameter was
inserted into a
silicone stopper and connected with the disposable polystyrene cuvette,
which contained aggregated LHA suspension. Another side of the capillary
was inserted into a silicone tube, through which the aggregated LHA
suspension was pumped. The aggregated suspension was gently placed
into the cuvette, and then the suspension was sucked through the capillary
into the 5 mL plastic syringe using a syringe pump (Fusion 200, Chemyx)
at a volumetric flow rate of 10 mL/min. This flow rate was selected
depending on the suitability of image capturing in the concerned pH.
In this investigation, we did not pay attention to the flow rate factor.
This is because we can predict the maximum size of the aggregates
under defined flow fields, once we get the strength. During the pumping
of the aggregated LHA suspensions, the aggregates were broken up by
the converging flow into the glass capillary. Then, the disaggregated
suspension of LHA in the capillary was observed through a digital
microscope for capturing the digital images of aggregates. The observation
region of the capillary was immersed in water in an O-ring sandwiched
between a glass slide and a glass coverslip to reduce optical distortion.
In this experiment, we always focused on the maximum size of the broken
aggregates because the largest aggregate after breakage represents
the strength of the LHA aggregates. The lengths of the major and minor
axes (dmaj and dmin) of the best-fit ellipse of the maximum-sized aggregate
were measured from the captured images by using ImageJ software (ImageJ
1.51K) because Blaser (2000 a,b)50,51 suggested
that the behavior of aggregates in flow fields can be approximated
as ellipsoids. The sucking of the aggregated suspensions through the
glass capillary generates a converging flow at the vicinity of the
entrance of the capillary and disrupts colloidal aggregates.50 All experiments were carried out in a temperature-controlled
room at around 20 °C.

Calculation of Aggregate Strength Force
We assumed
that the breakup of aggregate occurs if the hydrodynamic rupturing
force acting on the aggregates is more than the strength of the aggregate
itself.52−55 So, when the hydrodynamic rupturing force Fhyd acting on the LHA aggregates while entering into the glass
capillary exceeds the aggregate strength Faggregate, the aggregate breakup happens. 1  

At a certain
shear/extensional rate
of flow, larger aggregates are subjected to higher rupturing force,
inducing a breakup. Meanwhile, smaller ones can survive without breakage.
Therefore, the maximum-sized aggregates after breakage reflects the
strength of the aggregate where Fhyd = Faggregate.

Some authors already did some
other ways to get the floc strength
by direct measurement from the distortion of two micropipettes rupturing
the flocs56 or measured the size of flocs
as a function of the hydrodynamic force on flocs based on the force
balance.50−55,57 The behavior of flocs/aggregates
in flow fields can be approximated as solid ellipsoids.50,51 The size of broken flocs was also evaluated as a function of the
extensional rates of converging flows.48,49 Higashitani
et al. (1991)49 and Blaser (2000a)50 performed a direct observation of flocs breakup
and their deformation for flocs formed by polymeric and/or precipitated
coagulants. Their observation educed that the breakage of the flocs/aggregates
is caused by the extremely high elongation rate at the close proximity
of the tube entrance in the converging flow into the tube. The highest
elongation rate of flow, Ac,max, along
the centerline of the converging flow with a volumetric flow rate
of Q into the capillary tube with a radius R determines the maximum floc size, that is50,52,58 2  

The entire flow field around an orifice was numerically solved,
and it was deduced that the flow along the centerline can be regarded
as an axisymmetric straining flow.48 Thus,
the hydrodynamic rupturing force exerted on ellipsoidal flocs or aggregates
of LHA–Ca and/or LHA–Mg with a surface area, S, in an axisymmetric straining flow with an elongation
rate, A, can be calculated by the equation given
by Blaser (2002).59 3  where Chyd represents
a constant depending on the shape of the ellipsoidal flocs.

In this study, we focused on the maximum-sized aggregate after
the breakage, meaning that we calculated the maximum surface area, Smax, from the surface area of best-fit ellipsoids
corresponding to the LHA aggregates, S. This maximum
surface area of LHA aggregates Smax was
calculated by substituting the major and minor lengths (dmaj and dmin) of the fitted
ellipses into the following equation (Moriguchi 1987)60 4  where 2a = dmin and 2c = dmaj. Then, Chyd was
obtained from the values
listed in the paper by Kobayashi (2005),52 representing a ratio of dmaj/dmin. Now, we can calculate ChydSmax, which represents
the maximum values of ChydS of aggregates subjected to the flow with Ac,max.52,58 On the basis of the assumptions
that flocs/aggregates are subjected to higher stress when they flow
along the streamlines near the wall of the glass capillary, Kobayashi
(2004)58 deduced an equation to evaluate
the flocs/aggregate strength by using the following equation. 5  

Results and Discussion
Electrophoretic
Mobility of LHA in CaCl2 and MgCl2 Solutions
The values of electrophoretic mobility
of LHA at different ionic strengths of CaCl2 and MgCl2 are presented as a function of pH in Figures 2 and S2. Under
all measured pH conditions, the electrophoretic mobility shows the
negative value with a decreasing trend of absolute negative electrophoretic
mobility at low pH (3–6) in 2 mM ionic strength of CaCl2. The electrophoretic mobility of three different humic acids
in KCl solution has been presented in the Supporting Information of our recently published literature.34 The electrophoretic mobility of LHA in KCl solution
was also negative,34 though the absolute
value of mobility in KCl was higher than that of LHA in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions. This decreasing absolute value of
electrophoretic mobility with the increase of ionic valence from K+ to Ca2+ and Mg2+ is due to the screening
of the double layer of LHA. The electrophoretic mobility of the carboxylate
latex showed similar trends, but the mobility was constant at high
pH.61 We consider that this decreasing
absolute negative value of mobility is due to the binding of the divalent
cation with the −COO– groups of LHA. The
Ca binding diminishes the surface negative charge at the low charging
region of LHA, but this binding does not make any charge reversal
found for the hydrophobic latex and HSs with hydrophobic ions.34,62,63 Some theoretical modelling and
experimental studies already confirmed that the HSs with Ca2+20,64−66 and Mg2+19 show no charge reversal in any case of specific
or nonspecific binding; but at high pH, the mobility shows no notable
change of electrophoretic mobility or charge behavior. Previously
measured zeta potential by Kloster et al. (2013)20 and Attard et al. (2000)67 also
shows this constant charging trend in the presence of Ca at high pH.
In Figure 2, the electrophoretic
mobility of LHA in CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions
at 10 mM ionic strength shows no notable variation. At 30 mM CaCl2 and MgCl2, LHA also shows no noticeable effect
of ion type on the electrophoretic mobility (Figure S2), that is, the ion type has no specific effect on the charging
behavior of LHA; but there is a screening of the double layer by the
increasing ionic strength of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Figures 2 and S2).

Observation of Aggregation of LHA in CaCl2 and MgCl2 Solutions
We performed the
naked eye observation
and microscopic observation of aggregation and dispersion of LHA in
CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions at different ionic
strengths as a function of pH to clearly visualize and differentiate
the effect of ion type. We observed no macroscopic visual aggregates
of LHA at 2 and 5 mM MgCl2 (Figure 3A) solution under any pH condition, except
some tiny particulates under microscopy (Figure 4A,B); but at 5 mM CaCl2 solution,
we clearly observed large macroscopic visual aggregates of LHA at
higher pH around 7–10, though the microscopic aggregates of
LHA were also confirmed at lower pH range (Figures 3B and 4C,D). This
indicates that the Ca-induced aggregation of humic acid is triggered
at higher pH values than at low pH. Visible aggregates of LHA were
found in both cases of CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions
at 10 mM ionic strength. Indeed, LHA showed aggregation in both Ca
10 mM and Mg 10 mM solutions. In the Mg case, however, visible aggregates
were found only at pH around 3 and 10 (Figure 3C,D). The aggregation was confirmed by microscopic
and macroscopic observations, whereas LHA aggregates were observed
after 24 hours at all pH ranges for CaCl2 (Figures 3D and 5D–F). The aggregates were rapidly formed in the higher pH
range at the early time around 1–2 and 3 h for CaCl2 and MgCl2, respectively, after the mixing of the suspension
(See Supporting Information, Figure S1).
In the case of MgCl2, no aggregation was seen at a middle
range of pH around 6.5, except some very tiny particulates (Figure 5A–C). At the
increased ionic strength to 30 mM, we found that LHA showed large
aggregates at all studied pH values for both CaCl2 and
MgCl2 after 24 hours (Figures 3E,F and 6), though
aggregation was rapid in higher ionic strength at 30 mM and higher
pH range for both CaCl2 and MgCl2 solutions;
but LHA shows faster aggregation in CaCl2 solution than
in MgCl2 solution in each case of the experimental ionic
strength. This condition was confirmed by temporal changes of macroscopic
aggregation, and the aggregates arose at higher pH value than at lower
pH at earlier time after preparing the LHA suspension in CaCl2 or MgCl2 solution.

The aggregation of HSs at high
pH for CaCl2 was confirmed
by Kloster et al. 201320 and Baalousha
et al. 2006.68 The soil humic acid shows
less aggregation at lower pH values with Ca2+.20 Higher pH value induced higher binding of divalent
Cu and Cd11 and lower diffusion coefficients
of humic acid at higher pH in the presence of Ca.69 Several previous studies have already reported that Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions act in different ways for the interaction
with natural organic matter70−72 and humic acid coagulation;24 they confirmed the Ca dominancy over Mg for
humic acid aggregation. These results agree with the results of the
present study. This phenomenon is explained by the strong hydration
shell of Mg2+ ion than the Ca2+ ion.71 These previous studies obviously support our
findings of LHA aggregation in the presence of CaCl2 and
MgCl2, though Mg at 10 mM induced little macroscopic aggregates
at low pH around 3. This low pH aggregation occurred because of the
effect of the hydrophobicity of less charged humic acid itself at
low pH.73 Low pH-induced aggregation of
humic acid is also reported in some studies.19,26 These modest disagreements of low pH aggregation can be explained
by the difference in the source of humic acid or other source-dependent
character of humic acid. Some important properties of HSs such as
the hydrophobicity, polydispersity, and surface properties vary with
their source, which can affect the aggregation behavior.34,74

In a recent investigation, the coagulation behavior of humic
acid
was consistent with the classical Schulze–Hardy rule in the
presence of Cs+, Sr2+, and Eu3+.26 The increased coagulation by Sr2+ and Eu3+ indicated the formation of intra- or intermolecular
bridges between humic acid molecules confirmed by molecular dynamics
simulations.26 Contrary to this finding,
another study revealed that the aggregation of humic acid was not
directly related to the simple compression of the double layer, as
predicted by the Schulze–Hardy rule; but the reduction of intermolecular
repulsion by the formation of a chemical bond of metal ions with humic
molecules was also important.25 In their
study,25 they observed different threshold
concentrations for the aggregation of humic acid by Cu2+ and Cd2+, which was not possible to explain by the classical
Schulze–Hardy rule. This previous investigation25 supports our findings and signifies that the
divalent Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions have specific binding
phenomena to the HSs and cause the difference in their aggregation
behaviors at different pH values. We speculate that the larger size
of the hydrated Mg ion increases the distance to the chargeable site
of humic acid and thus weakens the ion binding and adhesion, depending
on the hydrophobicity of HSs at different pH values.

Aggregate Strength
of LHA in CaCl2 and MgCl2 Solutions
We measured the strength of aggregates of LHA
in the presence of 5, 10, and 30 mM ionic strength of CaCl2 and MgCl2 (Figure 7A–C), though MgCl2 at 5 mM showed no macroscopic
visual and microscopic aggregates, except some tiny particulates under
a microscope. So, we focused on the large visual aggregates in the
breakage experiment in a laminar converging flow and captured the
image of maximum-sized aggregates to evaluate the strength. To the
extent of our knowledge, we believe that this is the first approach
to evaluate the strength of HS aggregates expressed in numerical values,
whereas some indirect studies were performed to explore the strength
factor of alum kaolin flocs46 and humic
acid effect on Al-flocs43 in alternate
shearing condition by measuring the breakage and regrowth property
of flocs. Some studies reported a few nN of withstanding force of
polystyrene aggregates against breakup.58 The withstanding force was comparable with the adhesion force measured
by atomic force microscopy, and thus the aggregate strength is directly
related to the interparticle/intermolecular force.58 Other investigations reported the adhesion forces of 1–60
nN between different functional groups in water.75 This investigation proposed the dominancy of hydrophobic
effect on adhesion forces. A recent study described that the hydrogen
bonding and local electrostatic interactions induced larger pull-off
forces, 0.65–31 nN (13–618 μN/m  ∼50 μm), for the adhesion
of alginate hydrogels on −OH, −COOH, −CH3, or −NH2-terminated self-assembled monolayer
or protein films.76 The strength of LHA
aggregates at 5 mM CaCl2 increases with pH, and the maximum
strength is around 2 nN at pH around 9.5 (Figure 7A). The values are within the intermolecular
adhesion forces between organic groups in water described above. Thus,
the withstanding force of HS aggregates against breakage originates
from the intermolecular adhesion forces. The increasing strength of
LHA aggregates with pH can be explained by the more electrostatic
attraction between the negatively charged deprotonated −COO– sites of LHA through the bridging of Ca2+ ions. The Ca2+ ion bridging with LHA also makes large
aggregates of LHA and strong interaction at high pH. A recent study77 on the interactions between two opposing planar
surfaces end-tethered with poly(acrylic acid) in the presence of calcium
ions using molecular theory proposed the formation of calcium bridges.
The calcium bridge formation is strongly affected by the calcium concentration
and solution pH. This investigation also suggested that the increases
in pH and calcium concentration increase the surface–surface
attractions.77 This theoretical finding77 strongly supports our experimental results of
increasing aggregated strength with the increase of solution pH and
ionic strength of CaCl2 and MgCl2, whereas we
call for the direct measurement of adhesion force, unveiling the magnitude
of the Ca-bridge force. Additionally, Kobayashi (2005)52 described that the higher strength of Ca-coagulated
natural soil flocs than Na-coagulated flocs was because of divalent
Ca bridges to the surfaces or strong attraction due to ion–ion
correlation. In Figure 7B,C, the increased concentration of CaCl2 and MgCl2 also showed higher strength at high pH with a little fluctuation
at 30 mM in pH around 3. In every case of LHA aggregation, the MgCl2 solution results in lower strength than CaCl2 solution,
and the maximum strength was around 5.8 nN for CaCl2 in
30 mM ionic strength at pH around 9. Meanwhile, the maximum strength
in MgCl2 solution was much lower and around 2.4 nN in 30
mM ionic strength at pH around 9 (Figure 7C). We already discussed in the earlier section
that the Mg2+ ion has a strong hydration shell. Such stronger
hydration prevents closer contact between Mg2+ ions and
the carboxylic group of humic acid and thus weakens the binding with
LHA unlike the Ca2+ ion.71

Figure 7 Aggregate

of pH.

In this investigation, we did
not consider the significant effect
of hydrolyzed species of Ca and Mg ions because the experimental ionic
strength and pH ranges were low. A previous research on the yield
stress of washed α-Al2O3 suspensions demonstrated
the highest stress around pH 12 and 13 because of the formation of
Ca(OH)2 and Mg(OH)2 precipitates.78 Whereas the formation of Mg(OH)2 precipitate
occurs at pH around 10, which is lower than that for Ca(OH)2 at pH around 12, the present results show stronger Ca–humic
acid aggregates than Mg–humic acid aggregates. Therefore, the
effect of hydrolyzed species and precipitation of Mg and Ca ions cannot
explain the reason for stronger Ca–humic aggregates under the
present experimental conditions. Another investigation also confirmed
the insignificancy of hydrolyzed species for the divalent Ca2+ ion in the carboxylic latex particles,61 whereas Sugimoto et al. (2019)79 found
the significance of La3+ hydrolyzed species on the charge
reversal of sulfate latex particles.

Moreover, the aggregation
of humic acid is also influenced by the
source of humic acid, temperature, ionic type, and valence of inorganic
ions.26,34,41,68,80 The effect of these
factors on the strength can be examined in the future studies by the
present method.

The above sections of this paper have already
emphasized the facts
that the aggregation and dispersion of HSs are important because the
aggregation and dispersion alter the size of the transport unit of
HSs in environments. The strength, which is a withstanding force against
breakage, of aggregates of HSs is particularly crucial because the
aggregate size depends on the strength. In this study, we clearly
observed that the aggregation and dispersion of HSs are influenced
by pH, ionic strength, and ion species. Before this study, however,
no systematic data had been available for how these parameters influence
the value of strength of HS aggregates. In this paper, we obviously
manifested the results on the effect of pH, ionic strength, and divalent
cation types, Ca and Mg ions, on the aggregation behavior and especially
on the aggregate strength of LHA. Our results show that the strength
of LHA aggregates formed with divalent cations increases with pH.
Furthermore, Ca2+ ions induce the formation of stronger
aggregates than Mg2+ ions in the experimented ionic strength
of CaCl2 and MgCl2 under different pH conditions;
the values of maximum strength are around 5.8 nN for 30 mM CaCl2 and around 2.4 nN for 30 mM MgCl2 at pH around
9.

The present results provide useful insights into the prediction
and control of the transport and fate of HSs sorbed with chemicals
through the characterization of physical properties of aggregates
of HSs. The aggregate size can be evaluated, once the flow field is
characterized. The present load of heavy metals and synthetic chemicals
contamination in the soil and water environment in different zones
of industrialization is an issue of mitigation. These inorganic and
organic contaminants with different ionic balances can be mitigated
by using this technique of aggregation, which will help us to know
how to make more strong flocs and/or aggregates in natural or artificial
waterways for the safest way of pollutant transport. The distance
traveled by the pollutants and contaminants along with the natural
organic matter and/or humic acid is also a great concern of research
to predict the source and fate of pollutants in the transport ways
and water channel. This study will also certainly reveal the idea
and thoughts to find the source, origin, and travel distance of pollutants
from the strength of the aggregates by further simulation and empirical
studies, knowing specific flow fields. So, we believe that this method
of aggregate formation and the actual numerical value of aggregate
strength will tell us the proper way of pollutant transport and distribution
through artificial waterways.
