All-biobased and
biodegradable nanocomposites consisting of poly(l-lactide)
(PLLA) and starch nanoplatelets (SNPs) were prepared
via a new strategy involving supramolecular chemistry, i.e., stereocomplexation
and hydrogen-bonding interactions. For this purpose, a poly(d-lactide)-b-poly(glycidyl methacrylate) block copolymer
(PDLA-b-PGMA) was first synthesized via the combination
of ring-opening polymerization and atom-transfer radical polymerization.
NMR spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography analysis confirmed
a complete control over the copolymer synthesis. The SNPs were then
mixed up with the copolymer for producing a PDLA-b-PGMA/SNPs masterbatch. The masterbatch was processed by solvent
casting for which a particular attention was given to the solvent
selection to preserve SNPs morphology as evidenced by transmission
electron microscopy. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to highlight
the copolymer–SNPs supramolecular interactions mostly via hydrogen
bonding. The prepared masterbatch was melt-blended with virgin PLLA
and then thin films of PLLA/PDLA-b-PGMA/SNPs nanocomposites
(ca. 600 μm) were melt-processed by compression molding. The
resulting nanocomposite films were deeply characterized by thermogravimetric
analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. Our findings suggest
that supramolecular interactions based on stereocomplexation between
the PLLA matrix and the PDLA block of the copolymer had a synergetic
effect allowing the preservation of SNPs nanoplatelets and their morphology
during melt processing. Quartz crystal microbalance and dynamic mechanical
thermal analysis suggested a promising potential of the stereocomplex
supramolecular approach in tuning PLLA/SNPs water vapor uptake and
mechanical properties together with avoiding PLLA/SNPs degradation
during melt processing.

Introduction
Owing to their biobased
nature and biodegradability, poly(l-lactide) (PLLA)-based
packagings are promising for reducing the
environmental impact of plastic materials.1 Indeed, PLLA biodegradability is induced by hydrolysis of the ester
bonds, leading to successive reductions of molecular weight, allowing
the soil microorganisms to digest the oligomer fragments and reform
CO2, H2O, and biomass as end products.2 Furthermore, PLLA is a good candidate for new
developments because of its physical and mechanical properties that
can be tailored through polymer architecturing, allowing a good processability
with the most commonly used industrial methods.1,3

When considering food packaging applications, the preparation of
materials with interesting properties (mechanical, barrier, biodegradability,
etc.) and guaranteeing complete food safety remain a real challenge.
Among the strategies investigated, the incorporation of nanoparticles
seems most advantageous due to the large panel of fillers developed
and available today.1,4−6 Besides, particles
can also impart to polymer matrices’ enhanced mechanical and
thermal performances as well as protection against gases, invasion
of bacteria and microorganisms, harmful for food preservation.6 In this context, the use of organomodified montmorillonite
(clay) has already proved efficient.7 Properties
enhancement of clay-based nanocomposites results mainly from synergetic
interactions between the high surface area of clay and the polymer
chains.8 Regarding more specifically PLLA,
some interesting results have been obtained with a commercial organomodified
clay, the Cloisite30B (CL30B). These PLLA/clay nanocomposites prepared
by conventional melt extrusion exhibited remarkable oxygen permeability
values, twice lower for hybrid systems with loadings up to 10 wt %
of nanofillers compared to neat PLLA.9 Recently,
a PLLA/CL30B (3 wt %) nanocomposite substrate obtained by melt-mixing
and coated with a thin plasma polymer film of ethyl lactate has demonstrated
enhanced mechanical and optical properties as well as barrier properties
with an oxygen transmission rate reduced by 53% with respect to neat
PLLA, as reported by Ligot et al.10 Even
though these improvements are not sufficient for packaging applications,
the use of nanoclays may find interest in the multilayer concept or
can afford a control over the biodegradation of the material.11,12 However, the toxicity effect of CL30B for food contact applications
has been recently highlighted through in vitro experiments.13,14 Moreover, CL30B also induced a statistical change of the ribonucleic
acid messenger expression of the DNA. Nowadays, a specific genotoxicity
evaluation, assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA),
is still required for new substances intended to be used as food contact
materials.14 Thus, the development of new
biobased and biodegradable nanofillers, responding also to environmental
concerns, is highly encouraged.

With this respect, crystalline
polysaccharide nanoparticles from
renewable and biodegradable raw materials have drawn considerable
attention of the scientific community. Among all, starch nanoparticles
(SNPs) offer lots of promising opportunities in applications including
drug delivery, nanoencapsulation, or in conferring additional properties
to polymer matrices.15,16 More importantly, an interesting
aspect ratio with a platelet-like morphology makes them ideal candidates
for barrier properties improvement of polymers.17 Here, important challenges are the production and stabilization
of the SNPs, as well as their dispersion/compatibilization in polymer
matrices. Indeed, SNPs are mainly obtained via the dissolution and
degradation of the amorphous domains in semicrystalline starch granules
using acidic hydrolysis. Obviously, hydrolysis efficiency of starch
granules depends on parameters such as temperature, acid nature, concentration,
and botanic origin of the native starch, and is hard to handle with
a limited/lack of control and morphology preservation.18 Numerous other methods are reported for overcoming
these issues, including extrusion,19,20 high-pressure
homogenization and emulsification,21,22 ionic liquid
medium,23,24 solvent displacement method,18,25,26 or ultrasonication,27 with promising results for industrial applications.18

Surprisingly, even if SNPs seem to be
highly appropriated for food
packaging applications, the investigations in composite materials
based on them are relatively scarce and only few matrices, including
poly(styrene-co-butyl acrylate), natural rubber,
pullulan, thermoplastic starch, poly(vinyl alcohol), soy protein,
and waterborne polyurethane,18 have been
reported. The main issues preventing their use in a wider range of
polymers are their lack of compatibility with many solvents usually
employed in polymer solvent casting and their low thermal stability
detrimental for melt-mixing processes.17,18,28 To overcome these drawbacks and to possibly open
a way for SNPs’ industrial applications in composites, one
of the strategies consists in surface modifications of nanoplatelets.
Interestingly, starch nanocrystals are characterized by a reactive
surface due to higher amount of hydroxyl groups available for further
chemical modifications, and three main strategies have been reported
so far: (i) chemical modification with small molecules, (ii) “grafting
onto” polymer chains with coupling agents, and (iii) “grafting
from” polymer chains with polymerization of a monomer.28,29

In this study, PLLA/SNP composites have been prepared by melt-mixing
process to produce films suitable for industrial applications. For
this, two necessary prerequisites for a successful SNP incorporation,
at PLLA processing temperature, have to be fulfilled. The first challenge
consists in preserving the integrity of these SNPs highly sensitive
toward temperature and solvents, and the second consists in achieving
good dispersion and compatibility of particles with the matrix. A
new strategy for the preparation of PLLA/SNP nanocomposites using
a new compatibilizing diblock copolymer has been investigated. The
copolymer is composed of (i) a poly(d-lactide) (PDLA) building
block coined as sc-PLLA and (ii) a poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA)
block. The as-synthesized PDLA-b- (PGMA)- coined
as COPO- block copolymer was mixed up with SNPs by solvent casting
and subsequently the resulting “masterbatch” was melt-processed
with a commercially available poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) for
forming a 600 μm thick film by compression molding at 190 °C.
For the sake of comparison, PLLA, PLLA/PDLA-b-PGMA,
and PLLA/SNP samples were also prepared under the same experimental
conditions. The potential of SNPs/COPO toward improving the water
uptake and mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was studied
by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and dynamical mechanical analysis,
respectively.

Results and Discussion
The original
strategy proposed here for the preparation of PLLA/SNP
nanocomposites with enhanced properties relies upon the use of a new
compatibilizing diblock copolymer containing (i) a PDLA building block
able to form thermostable PDLA–PLLA stereocomplexes at melt-processing
temperature of the PLLA matrix,32,33 i.e., 190 °C,
and (ii) a poly(glycidyl methacrylate) block34−36 with epoxy
functional groups, which can interact with the hydroxyl groups available
on SNP surfaces. The concept is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic hydrogen-bonding interaction between
P(D)LA-b-PGMA copolymers and SNP surface.

Synthesis of the P(D)LA-b-PGMA Copolymer
To ensure good dispersion of the SNPs throughout the PLLA matrix,
PGMA-b-P(D)LA diblock copolymers were purposely designed.
The PGMA epoxy moieties are expected to interact through chemical
and/or supramolecular grafting with the surface OH groups available
on SNPs and consequently ensure dispersibility (within the PLLA matrix)
and thermal protection (during melt processing) of the grafted SNPs
via supramolecular hydrogen bond-induced stereocomplexation between
PDLA blocks and PLLA matrix.

The synthesis is based on the work
published by Wolf et al., in which a poly(lactide)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) was reported.37 It relies on a two-step process, including (i) the synthesis
of a α-hydroxy-ω-Br PDLA via lactide ring-opening polymerization
(ROP) (Figure 2A),
(ii) followed by PDLA-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization
(ATRP) of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) (Figure 2B). The chemical structure of each block
was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy performed in deuterated
chloroform as solvent (Figure 3). As expected, the PDLA spectrum presented all chemical signals
of the CH and the CH3 protons from the lactide monomer units. The chemical signal at 1.86
ppm was ascribed to the protons of the bromobutyryl CH3 groups (protons d, Figure 3, blue line). Furthermore, no residual lactide
monomer could be observed after purification (Figure 3). In agreement with the expected PDLA-initiated
ATRP of GMA, a clear shift of these protons to 1.22 ppm (protons d′, Figure 3, black line) was
observed in the NMR spectrum of the obtained copolymer, accompanied
by the presence of the signals characteristic for the PGMA block.
Thus, successful GMA polymerization is suggested. According to the
literature,38 the satellite signals denoted
as “g” are ascribed to the CH2 groups next to the oxirane ring of the GMA monomer. Additionally,
the chemical signals for the residual CH2 protons of the GMA double bond were used to calculate a monomer
conversion of 93%. Thus, the degree of polymerization of the PGMA
block was calculated to be 94, and the Mn was found to be 13 350 g mol–1 (Table 1).

The shift of the polymer elution trace toward lower elution volumes
from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis has also confirmed
successfulness of the ATRP reaction (Figure 4). The narrow distribution curve (ĐSEC < 1.15) suggests a good control
over the copolymerization even though a small tail remains visible
at lower elution volumes. This fraction of higher molecular mass copolymer
chains likely results from the copolymerization reaction as initiated
by some longer P(D)LA chains (also visible on the SEC trace of the
macroinitiator and probably formed by intermolecular transesterification
reactions during the lactide ROP).

Characterization of P(D)LA-b-PGMA Copolymer/SNPs
Interactions
To shed more light on the nature of the interactions
between the PLLA, P(D)LA-b-PGMA copolymer, hereafter
coined as COPO, and SNPs, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was used.
It is a useful technique for monitoring the possible etherification
reaction between SNP hydroxyl and an epoxy ring39 due to a strong absorption band, related to the oxirane
group at 4534 cm–1 that would decrease with epoxy
ring opening by the OH function. Figure 5 depicts the NIR spectra obtained for COPO
and COPO/SNP samples, with 50 wt % of SNPs, before and after drying
step at 60 °C for 6 days. At 4534 cm–1, the
spectrum of COPO is characterized by the C–H stretching and
bending of epoxy ring with no modification before and after heat treatment.
Similarly, for COPO/SNPs system, the characteristic band of epoxies
is visible at 4540 cm–1 both before and after heat
treatment with same intensity, meaning that no reaction occurred.
Therefore, the interactions between the epoxy rings and the SNP OH
groups could not be easily identified. For a better understanding,
a complete study must be realized and is currently in progress, but
the main subject of this article is to highlight the interest of the
PDLA-b-PGMA for melt processing of PLLA/SNP materials.

PLLA/SNPs-Based Nanocomposites
For comparison, as dimethyl
formamide (DMF) is miscible in CHCl3 and for promoting
the drying step, the casting process of PLLA/SNP composites was conducted
in a CHCl3/DMF mixture (8.7% of DMF). After an efficient
drying step (see Experimental Part), thin
films of PLLA/SNP nanocomposites were obtained using compression-molding
techniques at 190 °C (Table 2).

Visual Aspect and Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analyses
Visual observations were
used to appreciate the effect of the processing
method on the film’s aspect. Indeed, when thermally unstable
SNPs are to be incorporated into a polymer matrix via high-temperature
melt processing (at 190 °C for PLA), the expected coloration
will be very indicative for the composite thermal stability. Photos
of the films after processing are presented in Figure 6, evidencing composition-dependent thermal
stability. As expected, the PLLA sample is colorless and transparent,
which is characteristic of the commercial-grade PLLA with low d-LA content and low crystallinity degree (see Experimental Part). The PLLA/SNP sample is rather brown, most
probably due to an important degradation of the fillers and/or PLLA.
In sharp contrast, the PLLA/COPO/SNPs remain colorless and transparent
with no visible aggregates. To highlight the possible degradation,
SEC measurements have been attempted but data were not acquired because
of difficulty to selectively recover the PLLA chains fully deprived
from the starch nanocrystals. Interestingly, differences in filtration
were observed depending on samples. If PLLA filtration was very easy,
then filtration of the PLLA/SNP sample was more difficult and totally
impossible for the PLLA/COPO/SNP film, confirming further the strong
supramolecular interactions between COPO epoxy groups and SNP hydroxyl
groups.

Figure 6 Visual aspects of PLLA, PLLA/SNP, and PLLA/COPO/SNP nanocomposite
films as obtained by compression molding at 190 °C.

It comes out that the incorporation of COPO allows
certain compatibility
between SNPs and PLLA matrix (PLLA/COPO/SNPs = 94/3/3 wt %) and provides
a sufficient interfacial synergy between PLLA and SNPs for protecting
SNPs from thermal decomposition.

Morphological investigations
by TEM also revealed differences in
SNP dispersion between PLLA/SNP and PLLA/COPO/SNP samples (Figure 7). Concerning PLLA/SNPs,
only SNP aggregates or agglomerates are visible (see black dots),
whereas PLLA/COPO/SNPs present very few small aggregates of around
200 nm diameter (black object). However, regardless of the samples,
no individual SNPs could be clearly observed at both low and high
magnifications probably due to charge effects and lack of contrast
as a result of the organic nature of SNPs, COPO, and PLLA.

of PLLA/SNPs (A, A′) and PLLA/COPO/SNPs (B, B′).

For focusing on possible effect
of the finer dispersion of SNPs
onto the PLLA/SNPs nanocomposite properties, thermal stability, crystallinity,
and water adsorption were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and QCM analysis,
respectively.

Thermal Behavior
Thermal degradation
of PLLA, PLLA/COPO,
PLLA/SNP, and PLLA/COPO/SNP nanocomposites was studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) under nitrogen flow (Figure 8). The maximum in the first derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) was chosen to compare the thermal behavior of the nanocomposites.
As expected, PLLA thermal degradation occurs in one step characterized
by a maximum of DTG at 370 °C with no charred residue. With 3
wt % of COPO, the maximum of DTG remains constant (i.e., 374 °C).

curves of PLLA (●), PLLA/COPO (□), PLLA/SNPs
(*), and PLLA/COPO/SNPs (○) with 3 wt % of SNPs under N2, at 20 °C min–1.

In contrast, with 3 wt % SNPs, the maximum of DTG is largely
shifted
to lower temperatures (i.e., 348 °C). This result, showing a
possible alteration of PLLA structure, confirms first conclusions
drawn from the visual aspect of the PLLA/SNP film that appeared brown
(Figure 6). The degradation
phenomena observed by both analyses could be explained by a reaction,
occurring during melt processing, of SNP hydroxyl groups on PLLA inducing
polyester chain scission. PLLA degradation is well documented, and
factors including temperature, pH, and presence of terminal carboxyl
or hydroxyl groups are known to induce it.40 Thus, these processes generally lead to a decrease of the molecular
weight of PLLA, resulting in less thermally stable shorter chains.41 Regarding PLLA/COPO/SNP sample, TGA analysis
presents a maximum DTG at the same temperature as neat PLLA (i.e.,
370 °C). Very interesting, and also in agreement with visual
aspects, no effect of SNPs on PLLA integrity is noted on DTG curve.
In this case, the preformed supramolecular hydrogen bonds between
the epoxy groups of the compatibilizer and hydroxyl groups of SNPs
likely prevent both the nanoplatelets and the PLLA matrix from degradation
during melt processing.

A series of DSC experiments were then
conducted for further investigating
the thermal properties of PLLA/SNP nanocomposites (Figure 9). Thermograms are shifted
vertically to facilitate interpretation. Data of DSC first heating
cycle, such as cold crystallization temperature (Tcc), melting point temperature (Tm), endothermic cold crystallization, the corresponding enthalpies
(ΔHcc and ΔHm), stereocomplex melting temperature (Tm(sc-PLA)), and stereocomplex melting enthalpy
(ΔHm(sc-PLA)), are summarized
in Table 3. The neat
PLLA matrix exhibits a semicrystalline behavior with a very broad
cold crystallization, the peak temperature (Tcc) of which is at 113 °C, and endothermic melting occurring
at a melting temperature (Tm) of 168 °C.
As expected, the DSC analysis of the PLLA/COPO sample exhibits two
endothermic melting peaks: the first one at 162 °C due to homo-PLLA
crystallite and the second peak at 203 °C due to sc-PLA.30 Noteworthy, the PLLA melting endotherm (at 162
°C) turned bimodal due to melt recrystallization or the formation
of α′-PLA crystals generated during thermal treatment
and coexisting with the regular α form.7,42 Besides,
no significant influence of the presence of 3 wt % COPO was found
on crystallinity because values of 3.0 and 3.7% have been calculated
for samples PLLA and PLLA/COPO, respectively. This is in agreement
with the literature,43 demonstrating that
for blends containing less than 6 wt % of PDLA, the crystallites are
not fully developed upon cooling from the melt. Moreover, taking into
account the PDLA weight content measured herein (1.5 wt %), the ΔHm(sc) value for the (PLLA/COPO) sample (i.e.,
65 J g–1sc-PLA recalculated considering
3 wt % of stereocomplex in the entire sample) was lower than the value
reported in the literature for the sc-PLA measured with pure stereocomplex
(i.e., ΔHm(sc) = 142 J g–1sc-PLA32,44). One would assume
that the mobility of PDLA for initiating stereocomplexation is hindered
by PGMA block. These results suggest that global PLLA crystallization
degree is depressed by the procedure and more particularly by the
rapid cooling of the samples to room temperature after melting, leading
to a minimal nucleating effect of PLLA and a possible epitaxial crystallization
of homocrystallites of PLLA on sc-PLA.30

c ΔHm(sc-PLA) values recalculated according to 3 wt % of

Concerning
the PLLA/SNP sample, Tcc of PLLA shifted
toward lower temperatures (i.e., Tcc(homoPLLA) (PLLA/SNPs) = 102 °C vs Tcc(homoPLLA) (PLLA) = 111 °C) confirming the assumption
of PLLA degradation during melt processing. A 2-fold increase in PLLA
crystallinity value (Table 3) was also observed, which may be due to shorter macromolecular
chain lengths that induce more mobility promoting higher crystallization.
Regarding the thermal properties of PLLA/COPO/SNPs, the Tcc of PLLA appears at the same temperature as neat PLLA
and the corresponding crystallinity degree remains in the same range.
However, the PLLA melting endotherm also became bimodal, highlighting
the formation of crystals with different morphologies. The sc-PLA
is always observed at 203 °C, and we can note that ΔHm(sc-PLA)(PLLA/COPO/SNPs) is slightly
lower than ΔHm(sc-PLA)(PLLA/COPO), i.e., 57 vs 65 J g–1(sc-PLA). To sum up, from all characterizations, it can be reasonably concluded
that prior mixing of copolymer and SNPs leads to a good protection
of SNPs from thermal degradation due to strong interactions between
SNP hydroxyl groups and PGMA epoxy rings. Moreover, the selection
of PDLA as the copolymer second block allowed the formation of PLLA/PDLA
stereocomplexes, promoting further the good dispersion of SNPs into
PLLA matrix.

QCM Analysis of PLLA/SNP-Based Nanocomposites
Quartz
crystal microbalance measurements on cast (nanocomposite)films were
used to investigate the water sorption properties of the samples when
exposed to humid environment.45 For this,
changes in frequency (Δf) and thus in mass
(cf. eq 2) were recorded
as a function of relative humidity (RH), which successively increased
from 0 to 50% (after 1800 s) and from 50 to 80% (after 3600 s). As
noted in Experimental Part, Δf is initially taken as zero after overnight drying of samples
on the QCM. Representative data are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Time dependence of the relative mass change
for thin PLLA/SNP-based
films upon two relative humidity increase steps from 0 to 50% (after
1800 s) and then from 50 to 80% RH (after 3600 s). Legends are added
above the corresponding curve at each step.

As seen, when samples are exposed to a 50% relative humidity
(RH),
relative mass uptakes of 0.41, 0.32, 0.73, and 0.54% were calculated
for PLLA, PLLA/COPO, PLLA/SNPs, and PLLA/COPO/SNPs, respectively,
stating that films filled with SNPs (highly hydrophilic fillers) absorb
generally more water than the polymer matrix. However, these preliminary
results have to be carefully considered, knowing that part of the
PLLA might be degraded during melt processing. Sharp et al.46 found that the penetration of water in a PLLA
homopolymer significantly depends on the polyester Mn due to plasticizing effect. By increasing the RH rate
to 80%, one can still note higher water absorption for PLLA/SNPs in
comparison to PLLA, i.e., 1.1% of RH against 0.86% of RH, respectively.

Regarding PLLA/COPO and PLLA/COPO/SNPs at 50% RH, two opposite
effects were observed. Although the presence of 3% COPO within PLLA
seems to increase the hydrophobicity of the blend material, the presence
of SNPs increases its hygroscopic character. Thus, the PLLA/COPO/SNP
composite film absorbs more water than PLLA/COPO but less water than
PLLA/SNPs. Of course, the preservation of PLLA molar mass could also
play a role and cannot be excluded. Similar results were obtained
at 80% RH and might be explained with the plasticizing effect, impeding
the decrease in the sorption rate over time.46 It might be thus concluded that the optimization of water uptake
for a specific application has to consider opposite composition-related
and plasticizing effects.

Thermomechanical Properties of PLLA/SNP-Based
Nanocomposites
Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA)
can provide reliable
information on the storage modulus (E′), i.e.,
the elastic response to deformation (Figure 11A) and the loss modulus (E″), i.e., the viscous response to deformation (Figure 11B) of (composite) polymeric
materials. Data have shown that E′ values
of all melt-blended samples decrease gradually upon heating from 0
to 75 °C, with a more rapid decrease in the glass-transition
region of PLLA, between 35 and 50 °C. Below the Tg (e.g., at 20 °C), native PLLA is characterized
by a lowest storage modulus, whereas PLLA/COPO shows a slightly higher
value, suggesting that the copolymer addition affects PLA chain mobility.
The blend polymers remain stiffer, and the polymer flow is restricted.
This effect can also be observed in the α-transition region
derived from the loss modulus curves (Figure 11A). The slight shift of E″ from 47 to 44 °C indicates that the presence of the
copolymer hinders the mobility of PLLA chains.

Figure 11 DMTA traces of (A) storage
modulus (E′)
and (B) loss modulus (E″) of PLLA (●),
PLLA/COPO (□), PLLA/SNPs (*), and PLLA/COPO/SNPs (○)
with 3 wt % SNPs.

Adding SNPs to the neat
PLLA matrix using melt blending leads to
a material with a storage modulus higher than neat PLLA (+8%), highlighting
the interest of starch nanoparticles for mechanical properties. However,
the shift of the peak of loss modulus from 47 to 39 °C confirms
that the presence of SNPs leads to a degradation of PLLA matrix and
thus increases the mobility of the shorter chains of PLLA after glass
transition. Regarding PLLA/COPO/SNPs, a highest storage modulus with
an improvement of 12% compared to PLLA/COPO is observed. More interestingly,
the loss modulus of PLLA/COPO/SNPs is similar to that of PLLA/COPO.
Therefore, it might be considered that the use of copolymer PDLA-b-PGMA is a promising strategy for preparing all-biobased
composites for food packaging.

this study, investigations on PLLA/SNP-based nanocomposites
obtained by melt processing are reported. For this, a copolymer PDLA-b-PGMA aiming at promoting a good dispersibility of the
platelet nanofillers into PLLA matrix as well as preserving their
morphology is first synthesized. It is expected to react via (i) strong
supramolecular interactions and/or grafting of the epoxy functions
of PGMA moieties and the hydroxyl groups of SNPs and (ii) supramolecular
hydrogen-bond-related stereocomplexation between PDLA block and PLLA
matrix thermoresistant at PLLA melt temperature (i.e., 190 °C).
It was evidenced that the good synergetic effect of the copolymer
on both SNPs and PLLA allowed for an improvement of the thermal stability
and mechanical properties of PLLA with SNPs due to an efficient protected
effect of copolymer PDLA-b-PGMA. Preliminary results
on water uptake tests by QCM and DMTA open new perspectives for tuning
the water absorption properties of PLA/SNPs using adapted compatibilizers,
which allow to prepare melt-processed PLA/SNP materials.

Experimental
Part
Materials
Poly(l-lactide) (PLLA-4032D, NatureWorks
LLC, film-grade, Mn(PS) = 143 000, Đ = 2, according to supplier: d-isomer =
1.4%; relative viscosity = 3.94; residual monomer = 0.14%), waxy maize
(Roquette, 99% of amylopectin), 2-hydroxyethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate
(HBMP, Sigma-Aldrich), tin(II)-2-ethylhexanoate (Sn(Oct)2, Sigma-Aldrich), and N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine
(PMDETA, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. SNP preparation and
characterization have been described in the Supporting Information. d-Lactide (Purasorb D, Purac) was stocked
in a glovebox prior to use. Glycidyl methacrylate (GMA, Sigma-Aldrich)
was dried over anhydrous calcium hydride for 24 h at room temperature
and purified by vacuum distillation at 60 °C prior to use. Copper(I)
bromide (CuBr, Sigma-Aldrich) was purified by three consecutive washings
with acetic acid and methanol and stocked under inert atmosphere prior
to use. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4), chloroform (CHCl3), toluene, dimethyl formamide (DMF), and heptane were of
reagent grade supplied by VWR. Dry solvents were obtained using an
MBraun solvent purification system under N2 flow.

Synthesis
of the First Block Poly(d-Lactide) (P(D)LA)
Macroinitiator
PDLA was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization
of d-Lactide (d-LA) catalyzed by tin(II) octoate
and initiated by 2-hydroxyethyl 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate (HBMP).
Dry toluene (40 mL, 2 mL g–1 of LA) was added to d-LA (20.3 g, 144.1 g mol–1, 140 mmol) in
a flame-dried two-necked round-bottom glass flask equipped with a
magnetic stirring bar. Then, the toluene solution of Sn(Oct)2 (2.4 mL; 5.8 × 10–2 M solution; 405.1 g mol–1; 1.39 × 10–4 mol) was added
to the reaction medium with a flame-dried syringe. The solution was
heated at 120 °C using an oil bath, and polymerization was initiated
after 2 min by injection of HBMP (291 mg, 0.2 mL; 1.3 × 10–4 mol) under nitrogen flow. The reaction was conducted
for 18 h before being stopped by cooling to room temperature. The
obtained product was dissolved in CHCl3, and an aliquot
of the sample for conversion analysis was harvested prior purification
by precipitation in excess of cold methanol. Then, the polymer was
recovered by filtration using Büchner system and dried under
reduced pressure at 30 °C up to a constant weight. A white power
was recovered (19.5 g, 96%). The respective chemical signals are: 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ ppm: 1.57 (d, CH(CH3), poly(lactide) chain); 1.59 (d, CH(CH3) term. unit); 1.91 (s, BrC(CH3)2); 4.38 (q, CH(CH3) term. unit); and 5.15 (q, CH(CH3),
poy(lactide) chain).

Synthesis of the Second Block Poly(Glycidyl
Methacrylate) (PGMA)
The second block of the copolymer was
synthesized using ATRP route
from PDLA macroinitiator. In a typical polymerization, 5 g of macroinitiator
PDLA [MA] (5 g, 16 411 g mol–1, 3.45 ×
10–4 mol), CuBr [I] (49.4 mg, 143.4 g mol–1, 3.45 × 10–4 mol), and PMDETA [L] (60 mg,
173.3 g mol–1, 3.45 × 10–4 mol) were dried using three freeze–pump–thaw cycles
in a flame-dried two-necked round flask with a magnetic stirring bar.
Dry toluene (100 mL, 85 °C) was used as solvent, and the monomer
GMA [M] was previously dried under CaH2 overnight. The
freshly distilled GMA (4.7 mL (4.9 g); 142.1 g mol–1, 3.45 × 10–2 mol) was added to a second flame-dried
two-necked round flask with a magnetic stirring bar. The polymerization
started when the first mixture was transferred to the second flask
(MA[1]/I[1]/L[1]/M[100]) using a dried-flame capillary. After 90 min,
the medium was cooled to room temperature. An aliquot of crude product
was used for the conversion calculation by 1H NMR spectroscopy
(Figure 3). Then, the
product was recovered after precipitation in 7 volumes of n-heptane, filtered, and dried under hood for 48 h and under
reduced pressure at room temperature overnight. The copper was extracted
using an alumina-Celite column as attested by a white powder coloration
(7.3 g), and the resulting PDLA-b-PGMA copolymer
(referred to as COPO in the following sections) was characterized
by 1H NMR spectroscopy. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ ppm: 0.70–1.10 (m, C(CH3)(COOCH2CH2–O–CH2)); 1.29 (d, HOCH(CH3), poly(lactide)
term. unit); 1.58 (OCH(CH3), poly(lactide)
chain), 1.70–2.05 (m, −CH2C(CH3)(COOCH2CH2OH)); 3.23 (s, −COOCH2CH2OH); 3.82–4.29 (s, −COOCH2CH2OH); 4.03–4.46
(p, HOCH(CH3); poly(lactide) term. unit);
and 5.17 (q, CH(CH3); poly(lactide) chain).

Preparation of PLLA-Based Nanocomposites
A solvent
exchange of the SNP aqueous suspension from water to acetone and to
DMF was carried out using successive redispersion and centrifugations
for 10 min at 13 000 rpm. From the obtained suspension of SNPs/DMF
(0.8 wt % SNPs), PLLA-based nanocomposites with 3 wt % SNPs were prepared.
The weight ratio of [COPO]/[SNPs] was fixed at 25.8/100 g and mixed
with PLLA in a CHCl3/DMF mixture (8.7% of DMF). To obtain
solid samples, all solutions were first dried under reduced pressure
(room temperature, 1 h) and then in a ventilated oven (60 °C,
1 week) until reaching a complete removal of solvents as assessed
by TGA (not shown here). The collected samples were finally compression-molded
into 600 μm films for 5 min at 190 °C under a pressure
of 150 bar using an Agila PE20 hydraulic press and then rapidly cooled
to room temperature.

Characterizations
1H
NMR spectra were collected
in CDCl3 solution on a Bruker AMX-500 NMR spectrometer.
PLLA and PDLA-b-PGMA solutions were prepared in CHCl3 (2 mg mL–1), and molecular weight parameters
(Mn, Mw, and Đ) were determined by SEC at 30 °C using an Agilent
liquid chromatograph equipped with an Agilent degasser, an isocratic
HPLC pump (flow rate = 1 mL min–1), an Agilent autosampler
(loop volume = 100 μL; solution concentration = 2 mg mL–1), an Agilent-DRI refractive index detector, and three
columns: a PL gel 5 μm guard column and two PL gel Mixed-B 5
μm columns (linear columns for separation of Mw(PS) ranging from 200 to 4 × 105 g mol–1). Polystyrene standards were used for calibration.
Near-infrared spectra were recorded in transmission mode with a Bruker
Tensor 27 infrared spectrometer. NIR analyses were performed on thin
films prepared by solvent casting from chloroform/DMF solution. Samples
were scanned in the frequency range of 4000–5000 cm–1 at a resolution of 4 cm–1 and an accumulation
of 32 scans before and after heat treatment at 60 °C. TEM images
of SNP suspensions and PLLA/SNP nanocomposites were obtained from
a CM100 microscope (Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) at an accelerated
voltage of 100 kV. Sections of 80 mm thick nanocomposites were prepared
at −130 °C using a Reichert-Jung Ultracut FC4E microtome
equipped with a diamond knife. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were
performed at a heating rate of 20 °C min–1 from
room temperature to 800 °C using a Hi-Res TGA Q5000 device from
TA Instruments (Del, NY). Thermodegradation was determined on approximately
10 mg of samples with platinum sample pan in 25 cm3 min–1 of nitrogen flow. A DSC Q2000 from TA Instruments
was used for DSC analyses in nitrogen atmosphere. Samples (weight:
about 5–7 mg) were sealed in aluminum DSC pans and placed in
the DSC cell. The DSC was calibrated with indium. The samples were
heated from 0 to 250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1. Relevant data were collected from the first heating
scan to evaluate the role of the stereocomplex (sc) in PLLA crystallization.
Enthalpy values were calculated according to homo-PLLA to sc-PLA ratio.
The degree of crystallization (χc(homo-PLLA)) was obtained using eq 1 1  where ΔHm(homoPLLA) and ΔHc(homoPLLA) are the melting
and cold crystallization enthalpies, respectively, of PLLA test sample,
ΔHm(homoPLLA)0 is the melting enthalpy of the 100% crystalline
homo-PLLA (93.0 J g–1),30 and % wtfiller is the weight percentage of filler. ΔHm(sc) corresponding to the melting of PLLA–PDLA
stereocomplexes has been calculated taking into account only the amount
of formed stereocomplex (3 wt %). Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
was performed with a Seiko EG&G model 917 Quartz Cristal Analyser
(QCA 917). Quartz crystals were provided by Ametek (Princeton Applied
Research). A gold deposit (0.2 cm2, thickness ∼
3000 Å) was immobilized on the crystal through a sublayer of
titanium (thickness ∼ 500 Å). For analyses, compressed
samples were first solubilized into CHCl3 (∼2.5%).
Then, 6 μL of the solution was deposited on the electrode and
dried under reduced pressure at room temperature overnight. The frequency
was finally measured automatically at regular intervals and controlled
relative humidity (RH, i.e., 30 min at 0% RH, 30 min at 50% RH, 90
min at 80% RH). The relationship between frequency of the quartz crystal
and absorbed water mass is given by eq 2 obtained from the Sauerbrey relation31 2  where ΔF (Hz) is the
frequency variation induced by the mass variation ΔM (g); A is the “active area” of the
crystal; and F0 is the initial frequency
of the crystal. The rates of sorption were obtained using Fick’s
law of diffusion. Dynamical mechanical thermal analyses (DMTAs) were
performed with a DMAQ800 from TA Instruments from 0 to 140 °C
on compression-molded (0.6 mm thick and 5 mm wide) sheets of either
unfilled PLLA or PLLA starch nanocomposites. Measurements were carried
out in tensile mode at 1 Hz with a deformation of 10 μm. The
heating rate was 3 °C min–1. DMTAs were performed
1 week after preparation and were realized on three specimens for
each formulation to check the reproducibility.
