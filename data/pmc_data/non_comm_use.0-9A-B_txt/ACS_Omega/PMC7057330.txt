The self-assembly
of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI)
with the star-shaped 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) on Au(111)
is investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy. PTCDI forms a
compact canted arrangement on the gold surface. When TAPB is sublimated
at a high temperature, the molecule dissociates into a 4-aminophenyl
group and a boomerang-shaped compound. The boomerang molecule self-assembles
with PTCDI to create a two-dimensional (2D) nanoarchitecture stabilized
by N–H···O–C hydrogen bonds between the
dissociated TAPB and PTCDI. The molecular ratio of this multicomponent
structure is 1:1.

Introduction
Intense research efforts have been focused
on engineering novel
nanomaterials and organic nanoarchitectures.1−9 Intermolecular as well as organometallic interactions can stabilize
molecular assemblies.1,10−13 Perylene diimide derivatives
are renowned compounds for their chemical and thermal stability as
well as their long-lasting photostability.14 They are thus promising molecules for engineering organic devices.
The perylene diimide structure can be customized to tune its electronic
properties or to modify its self-assembly.6,14−22 Numerous functionalized perylene derivatives have thus been synthesized
to create self-assembled two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-bonded nanoarchitectures
on flat surfaces.23−28 Multicomponent organic structures have also been achieved when mixing
these rectangular compounds with complementary molecules.29−32 Other molecular shapes have also been used for engineering original
nanostructures. For example, two-dimensional fractal nanoarchitectures
have been fabricated by taking advantage of the self-assembly of boomerang-shaped
molecules. These arrangements were stabilized by halogen bonds or
metal-coordinated interactions depending on the substituents placed
at each extremity of the molecules.33−35 Boomerang-shaped molecules
have also been mixed with star-shaped 1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene
(TAPB; Figure 1, right)
molecules to form covalently bonded Sierpiński triangles up
to the second generation, taking advantage of the Schiff-base reaction.36 Imineboroxine covalent porous hexagonal structures
have also been fabricated by mixing TAPB molecules with other organic
building blocks.37 Although PTCDI and TAPB
can form different arrangements on metal surfaces, it is unclear if
these two molecules are complementary building blocks to create new
multicomponent nanoarchitectures through self-assembly.

white balls are hydrogen atoms, and blue balls are nitrogen atoms.

Here, we investigate the self-assembly of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic
diimide (PTCDI) and TAPB molecules on Au(111). Scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) in ultrahigh vacuum reveals that PTCDI self-assembles
with dissociated TAPB molecules to form a two-dimensional two-component
nanoarchitecture stabilized by hydrogen bonds.

Results
The scheme
of the 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI)
molecule is presented in Figure 1, left. This rectangular molecule is composed of a
perylene center and one imide group at each side. The scheme of the
1,3,5-tris(4-aminophenyl)benzene (TAPB) molecule is presented in Figure 1, right. This star-shaped
molecule is composed of a benzene central ring surrounded by three
4-aminophenyl groups.

STM images of the PTCDI self-assembled
arrangement on the Au(111)
surface after the deposition of molecules at room temperature are
presented in Figure 2a,b. STM reveals that the molecules form chains running parallel
to each other. Molecules from neighboring chains are rotated in the
opposite direction by the same angle of ±12° (see the molecular
scheme superimposed on the STM image in Figure 2b). The PTCDI arrangement is stabilized by
double-hydrogen bonds (N–H···O) between imide
groups of adjacent molecules, as it is demonstrated by density functional
theory calculations.26 The network unit
cell of this “canted” structure is a parallelogram with
∼1.7 and ∼1.5 nm unit-cell constants and an angle of
∼95° between the axes.

self-assembly on Au(111)
15 × 13 nm2 (Vs = 0.6
V; It = 200 pA). (b) High-resolution STM
image of the PTCDI self-assembly, 6 × 6 nm2 (Vs = 0.6 V; It =
200 pA). As a guide for the eyes, the network unit cell (dashed white
lines) and molecular schemes are superimposed onto the STM image.

STM images of the step edge of PTCDI domains after
the deposition
of TAPB molecules at room temperature are presented in Figure 3a–c. STM shows that
intact star-shaped TAPB molecules can be locally observed. As a guide
for the eyes, these molecules have been colored in blue in the images.
STM also reveals that additional organic species coexist in the organic
layer. These species have either a boomerang shape or an egg shape.
These species have been colored in red and green in Figure 3a–c. It thus appears
that some TAPB molecules have been dissociated during the sublimation
process, as described in the scheme shown in Figure 3d. The egg-shaped species observed on the
surface correspond to TAPB 4-aminophenyl groups (green species in Figure 3d), whereas the boomerang-shaped
species correspond to two 4-aminophenyl groups connected to a benzene
ring (red species in Figure 3d). The STM images do not provide evidence of whether the
broken bond is homolytic or heterolytic or whether the two compounds
are two radicals or one cation and one anion.

10 × 5 nm2 (Vs = 0.6 V, It = 200 pA). (d) Scheme of the TAPB dissociation
into two compounds.

A two-dimensional PTCDI–TAPB
nanoarchitecture is locally
observed on the surface. An STM image of this multicomponent structure
is presented in Figure 4a. In this arrangement, the PTCDI molecules form parallel chains.
In contrast to the PTCDI self-assembly (Figure 2), the PTCDI molecules are parallel and are
aligned along the main axis of the chain. Neighboring PTCDI molecules
are also laterally shifted on the right and on the left on the chain
axis, alternatively. The PTCDI chains are separated by paired boomerang-shaped
TAPB molecules. These two molecules are arranged side-by-side and
are rotated by 180° in comparison to each other. They are oriented
perpendicular to the PTCDI chains. The high-resolution STM image of
the network unit cell and its corresponding model (Figure 4b,c) reveal that the organic
nanoarchitecture is stabilized by hydrogen bonds. Each 4-aminophenyl
group of the TAPB molecules forms one N–H···O–C
hydrogen bond with two neighboring PTCDI molecules. The network unit
cell of this structure is a lozenge (dotted lines in Figure 4b,c) with ∼2.4 nm unit
cell constant and an angle of ∼120° between the axes.
The network unit cell presented in Figure 4b shows that the molecular ratio (PTCDI/dissociated-TAPB)
composing this multicomponent nanoarchitecture is 1:1. The substantial
separation between neighboring dissociated TAPB molecules shows that
they did not react together.

nanoarchitecture

molecular arrangement observed in (a, b).

The STM image reveals that PTCDI molecules can be locally hosted
in the 2D architecture cavities. The fuzzy pattern often observed
in the other cavities probably results from organic species diffusing
inside the cavities.

Discussion
PTCDI molecules can form
various hydrogen-bonded nanoarchitectures
on flat surfaces.26 The canted arrangement
is the most observed network at room temperature on Au(111). This
structure is stabilized by double N–H···O bonds
between imide groups of adjacent molecules and C–H···O
between molecules of neighboring chains, as revealed by theoretical
calculations.26 Star-shaped molecules with
a central benzene ring and three functionalized benzene arms can also
self-assemble into numerous structures, either porous38 or compact,39 depending on the
nature of the substituents.

When PTCDI and star-shaped TAPB
are deposited simultaneously, a
2D multicomponent nanoarchitecture is locally observed on the Au(111)
surface (Figure 4).
The typical domain size is ∼500 nm2. STM reveals
that the TAPB molecules are partially dissociated in this structure,
that is, one 4-aminophenyl group is missing from the TAPB skeleton.
It appears that the high temperature selected for the sublimation
of the molecules from the Knudsen cell leads to the dissociation of
the TAPB molecules. The boomerang TAPB molecules are expected to be
highly reactive radicals. It would thus be expected that two molecules
react together and form dimers (see Figure 5b). There is however no evidence of the formation
of covalent bonds between TAPB molecules in the STM images of the
PTCDI–TAPB network. The separation between two neighboring
TAPB molecules appears first dark in the STM images, and the measured
distance between nitrogen atoms of neighboring TAPB molecules is 1.4
nm in the network (Figure 5a). This has to be compared with the theoretical 1.1 nm separation
if a dimer was formed (Figure 5b). This 26% increase in size rules out the formation of covalent
dimers. Dissociated molecules are expected to be highly reactive,40 but previous scanning probe microscopy (SPM)
observations revealed that dehalogenated and dehydrogenated molecules
can be stable on insulating thin films as well as metal surfaces.12,41−44Figure 5c shows that
the proposed model with a dissociated boomerang-shaped TAPB fits the
STM images. This is not the case when a TAPB covalent dimer is considered
(Figure 5d). STM images
also reveal that the four TAPB dissociated 4-aminophenyl groups can
locally replace the two dissociated boomerang TAPB molecules in the
PTCDI–TAPB cavities (Figure 5e). STM also shows that a misoriented boomerang TAPB
and a dissociated 4-aminophenyl group can also replace a boomerang
TAPB (Figure 5f).

Figure 5 (a) Scheme
of the 1.4 nm separation between two dissociated boomerang-shaped
TAPB molecules in the PTCDI–TAPB network. (b) Theoretical length
of the covalent TAPB dimer (1.1 nm). (c–f) High-resolution
STM images of cavities of the PTCDI–TAPB network, 3 ×
3.5 nm2 (Vs = −0.4 V, It = 400 pA). As a guide for the eyes, schemes
of PTCDI, TAPB dissociated 4-aminophenyl groups, and dissociated boomerang
TAPB molecules have been superimposed onto the STM images in (c–f).

In Figure 4, STM
shows that the PTCDI molecules form parallel chains, separated by
boomerang-shaped dissociated-TAPB molecules. STM also reveals that
this arrangement is stabilized by N–H···O bonds
between PTCDI and TAPB molecules, that is, each NH2 group
of TAPB forms hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of two neighboring
PTCDI molecules. In contrast to the PTCDI chain in the pure PTCDI
arrangement (Figure 2), there is no hydrogen bond between neighboring PTCDI molecules
in the PTCDI–TAPB network.

Conclusion
In
this paper, we investigated the self-assembly of PTCDI and star-shaped
TAPB molecules on Au(111) surfaces. STM reveals that PTCDI self-assembles
with dissociated boomerang-shaped TAPB molecules. This structure is
stabilized by hydrogen bonds between PTCDI and TAPB molecules. This
result opens new opportunities to create original 2D organic structures.
These observations should motivate experimental investigations with
low-temperature nc-AFM with a functionalized tip41,45−47 to locally characterize the charge and the stability
of dissociated molecules.

Experimental Section
Experiments
were performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chamber
at a pressure of 10–8 Pa. The Au(111) surfaces were
sputtered with Ar+ ions and then annealed in UHV at 600
°C for 1 h. PTCDI molecules (Figure 1, left) and TAPB molecules (Figure 1, right) were evaporated from
Knudsen cells at 250 and 280 °C, respectively, on a gold surface
kept at room temperature. The molecular coverage was less than 0.2
monolayer. Cut Pt/Ir tips were used to obtain constant-current STM
images at room temperature with a bias voltage applied to the sample.
STM images were processed and analyzed using the homemade FabViewer
application.48
