The effects of both
graphene nanoplatelets and reduced graphene
oxide as additives to the negative active material in valve-regulated
lead–acid batteries for electric bikes were investigated. Low-temperature
performance, charge acceptance, cycle performance, and water loss
were investigated. The test results show that the low-temperature
performance, charge acceptance, and large-current discharge performance
of the batteries with graphene additives were significantly improved
compared to the control battery, and the cycle life under 100% depth
of discharge condition was extended by more than 52% from 250 to 380
cycles. Meanwhile, the amount of water loss from the batteries with
graphene changed only slightly compared with the control cells. The
excellent performance of the batteries can be ascribed to the graphene
promoting the negative-plate charge and discharge processes and suppressing
the growth of lead sulfate crystals.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Over the past decade,
the number of lead–acid battery (LAB)
applications has expanded and the market demand has also increased
dramatically. Lead–acid batteries occupy more than a 60% market
share of the secondary power supply. China is one of the world’s
leaders in LAB production, accounting for 30% of the global LAB output.
China’s large market demand comes from a substantial increase
in the number of electric bikes (e-bikes).1,2 In
2017, the number of e-bikes in China reached 29.96 million and the
social adoption rate of e-bikes was above 10%. At present, the main
concern for consumers of e-bikes is the battery performance.3 The power source for an e-bike is a valve-regulated
lead–acid (VRLA) battery, consisting of three to four 12 V
modules with a total voltage of 36 or 48 V, and the capacity is 10–20
A h.1,4

VRLA batteries have high availability,
low cost, and good low-temperature
performance.5−7 Thus, VRLA batteries are used as the motive power
batteries for e-bikes. However, during the deep cycle duty of e-bike
VRLA batteries, the battery is charged and discharged with high currents,8,13 and the surface of the negative plate can become highly sulfated.
Sulfation is related to the formation of lead sulfate crystals.9 As the number of cycles increases, more PbSO4 crystals irreversibly accumulate on the negative plate, and
the very low conductivity of PbSO4 combined with the poor
solubility of large crystals leads to a decrease of the effective
active material of the negative electrode, which hinders the charge
and discharge processes of the negative electrode.7−12 As a result, the battery capacity degrades prematurely, greatly
reducing the battery cycle life.13

In order to solve the problem of cycle life of VRLA batteries,
many researchers have studied and found that adding a certain amount
of carbon materials (activated carbon,11,14,15 carbon black,11,14,16,17 graphite,15,17−19 or carbon nanotubes20−22) to the negative active
material (NAM) of the batteries can boost the utilization of active
substances, charge acceptance, high-current discharge performance,
cycle performance, and low-temperature performance. Carbon materials
are able to effectively prolong the cycle life of batteries by restraining
the sulfation of the negative plates, but their effects are different
depending on their types and specific surface area (SSA).23 Moseley24 concluded
that carbon materials with a high SSA (1400 m2 g–1) are more favorable for extending battery cycle life of batteries
than carbon materials with a lower SSA (less than 100 m2 g–1).

Moseley24,25 and others
summarized the contributions
of negative carbon additives to the battery performance: (i) diminishing
the contact resistance between the NAMs and decreasing the polarization;
(ii) enhancing the SSA and overall conductivity of NAMs;26,27 (iii) promoting uniform distribution of lead sulfate in the negative
plate, reducing the active material pore size, and impeding the growth
of PbSO4 crystals; and (iv) absorbing excess charge as
a capacitor and forming a conducting bridge between lead sulfate and
carbon particles.12

In recent years,
graphene use in VRLA batteries has drawn extensive
attention because of its outstanding properties such as its porous
structure, good conductivity, and large SSA.12,28−30 Yeung et al.28 reported
that the addition of 1.0 wt % graphene to the negative plate of hybrid
electric vehicle (HEV) VRLA batteries resulted in a partial-state-of-charge
(PSoC) cycle life improvement of 140%, average PbSO4 crystal
particle size reduction of about 25%, and reduced interfacial resistance.
In addition, Li et al.29 noted that adding
0.9 wt % graphene nanosheets to the NAM as skeletons to construct
a 3-D conductive framework in HEV batteries greatly enhanced the cycle
life by more than 370% from 2842 to 10 527 cycles under high-rate
PSoC (HRPSoC) conditions and increased the utilization of the NAM.
Zhu et al.30 concluded that graphene as
a negative material additive could reduce the charge cutoff voltage,
increase the discharge cutoff voltage, and also greatly improve HRPSoC
cycle life. However, all of these studies investigated graphene added
to VRLA batteries for HEV applications.12,28−30 Hence, it could be quite advantageous to add graphene in the NAM
to further improve the performance of VRLA batteries for e-bike duty.

In this work, we reported, for the first time, that graphene as
a negative additive can significantly enhance the performance of e-bike
motive power VRLA batteries. When used in the 100% depth-of-discharge
(100% DoD) cycle, the cycle life of the batteries containing graphene
was increased by more than 52% compared to that of the control batteries
containing acetylene black. In addition, the low-temperature performance
and the charge acceptance ratio of the batteries with graphene in
the negative electrode were improved.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Graphene Materials
In this experiment,
reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was prepared and tested alongside graphene
nanoplatelet materials provided by XG Sciences Inc. having three different
SSAs as shown in Table 1: graphene 1 (G1), graphene 2 (G2), and graphene 3 (G3). The SSAs
of G1, G2, G3, and RGO were 300, 467, 730, and 189 m2 g–1, respectively. RGO was prepared by Hummers’
oxidation–reduction reaction method. Table 1 lists the basic characteristics of four
types of graphene additives used in this work. The conductivity of
the four kinds of graphene is provided by the suppliers.

2.2 Preparation of VRLA Batteries
E-bike
batteries were used in this study. The VRLA (48 V 20 A h) batteries
consist of four 12 V modules (Figure 1). Each battery (module) (Figure 1b) has six cells, and each cell is composed
of four positive plates, five negative plates, and absorptive glass
mat separators. The negative plates were prepared using either graphene
or acetylene black (for a regular control battery) additives. Manufacturing
procedures included acid blending, grid casting, paste mixing, coating,
plate curing, sectioning of positive and negative plates, assembling,
cast-weld and into the case, over bridge welding and inspection and
seal-capping, soldering the terminal and sealed glue filling, leakage
test, acid (gel) filling, container formation, and finally matching
for delivery. It is worth noting that the whole production process
for the e-bike VRLA batteries with graphene was carried out using
a battery manufacturing plant line located in the Shandong Branch
of the Chilwee Company, which is the largest motive power e-bike VRLA
battery producer in China. The graphene and acetylene black additive
content in the NAM was 0.3 wt % (based upon the mass of leady oxide,
where 3 kg of graphene or acetylene black is added to 1000 kg of leady
oxide in every experiment). Other than the different types of graphene
added, all conditions were exactly the same as that of a commercial
manufacturing process of e-bike VRLA batteries.

h modules and (b) schematic illustration showing a module with six
cells inside the battery case.

2.3 Battery Tests Following the Standard E-Bike
Test Profile in China
2.3.1 Discharge Capacity (Room
and Low Temperatures)
2.3.1.1 Two Hour Capacity Test
Fully
charged batteries were put into a temperature box (25 ± 2 °C)
for 12 h. When the temperature of batteries reached 25 ± 2 °C,
the discharge capacity test was started. The batteries were discharged
to 42 V under a constant current of 10 A and then charged and discharged
for three cycles; the third discharge time was recorded.

2.3.1.2 Discharge Performance Test at a Low Temperature
(−15 °C)
Batteries fully charged at room temperature
were put into a low-temperature box (−15 ± 1 °C)
for 12 h. The batteries were then discharged to 42 V at a constant
current of 10 A, and the discharge time was recorded.

2.3.1.3 Charge and Discharge Performance Test
at a Low Temperature (−10 °C)
The batteries were
put into a low-temperature box (−10 ± 1 °C) for 12
h. The batteries were fully charged and then discharged to 42 V at
a constant current of 10 A in the low-temperature box, and the process
was repeated for five cycles. The fifth discharge time was recorded.
It is worth noting that the batteries were fully charged and discharged
at a low temperature of −10 °C during the whole measurement
process.

2.3.2 Larger Current Discharge
(1.8C2)
Fully charged batteries
were stored under
the condition of 25 ± 2 °C for 1–4 h. The batteries
were then discharged to 42 V at a constant current of 36 A, and the
discharge time was recorded.

2.3.3 Charge
Acceptance
Fully charged
batteries were discharged for 5 h (25 °C). The discharge current, I0, is Ca/10 A, where Ca (A h) is the largest capacity in 2 h capacity test. After being
discharged, the batteries were immediately put into a low-temperature
box (0 ± 1 °C) and held for 20–25 h. Then, the batteries
were taken out and charged at a fixed voltage of 57.6 V for 10 min,
recording the current, Ica. The charge
acceptance ratio is Ica/(C2/10), where C2 is the rated
capacity (2 h).

2.3.4 Cycle Life Test
Under the condition
of 25 ± 5 °C, the fully charged batteries were discharged
to 42 V at a constant current of 10 A (100% DoD). Then, the batteries
were charged at 58.8 V with a constant current of 2.5 A. When the
terminal voltage of batteries reached the charge limit voltage, they
were charged at a constant voltage of 58.8 V until the charge current
fell to ≤0.5 A. Then, they were allowed to rest for 10 min,
followed by charging at a constant voltage of 55.2 V for 4 h. Afterward,
they were allowed to rest for 1 h before repeating the next charge
and discharge cycle. The cycle life test was concluded when two consecutive
discharge times of less than 96 min (at a constant current of 10 A)
were recorded.

2.4 Physical Characterization
The morphology
and structure of the graphene additives were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, FEI QUANTA 200F) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100). The SSA and pore structure of the
samples were characterized using N2 adsorption–desorption
characteristics measured with a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument.
The samples were degassed at 200 °C for 5 h before measuring
under vacuum. Pore size distribution was based on the isotherms using
the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Raman spectra
of graphene additives were measured using a LabRAM HR Evolution instrument
with an excitation wavelength of 473 nm (blue). The functional groups
on the graphene additives were determined by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR, Nicolet 5700).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of the
Four Graphene Samples
The variation in physical properties
of different graphene materials,
such as aggregation size/shape, particle size, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, and pore volume, can affect the performance of
VRLA batteries. In order to draw conclusions about the effect of different-SSA
graphene on the batteries, four kinds of graphene materials were characterized.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and BJH pore size
distributions of the four graphene materials are shown in Figure 2. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms (Figure 2a) of G1, G2, G3, and RGO samples all show typical type-IV isotherms
with an H4 hysteresis loop in the relative pressure range of P/P0 = 0.40–0.90, indicating
the typical mesoporous structure in all samples.31 The SSA and pore volume of the four samples were obtained
by BET analysis. G3 possesses a large SSA of 730 m2 g–1 and a BJH desorption cumulative volume of pores of
1.032 cm3 g–1 between 1.7 and 300 nm
width, whereas G1 and G2 show much smaller SSAs (300 and 467 m2 g–1, respectively) and BJH desorption cumulative
volumes of pores (0.478 and 0.709 cm3 g–1, respectively). However, RGO had an SSA of 189 m2 g–1 and a BJH desorption cumulative volume of pores of
0.571 cm3 g–1. As shown in Figure 2b, all samples showed similar
BJH pore size distributions and only one mesoporous peak. The pore
sizes of G1, G2, and G3 are concentrated at 3–4 nm. As the
SSA increases, the pore size moves toward the smaller 3 nm, whereas
RGO had a smaller pore size of 2.5 nm, indicating that the four samples
had a homogeneous mesoporous structure. A mesoporous structure can
provide channels for the transmission of the acid electrolyte within
the cell and be useful to enhance the charge acceptance capability
of e-bike VRLA batteries in the deep cycle duty. The FT-IR spectra
(Figure 2c) show the
oxygen-containing functional groups of the four different graphene
additives. The characteristic peaks in the spectra of G2, G3, and
RGO around 3462 and 1098 cm–1 are related to the
O–H stretching and alkoxy C–O stretching vibrations,
respectively.12 Additionally, the peak
at 1652 cm–1 is weakly associated with hydroxyl
C–OH, and the peak at 1565 cm–1 is strongly
attributed to the −C=C– vibration of the graphene
lamellar skeleton. However, there is no obvious characteristic peak
for G1 in the spectrum. This is probably because G2 and G3 need longer
processing time, and this process is carried out in air, so there
exist some oxygen-containing functional groups in the carbon layer.

adsorption–desorption isotherms and (b) BJH
pore size distribution plots of graphene 1, graphene 2, graphene 3,
and RGO. (c) FT-IR spectra of graphene 1, graphene 2, graphene 3,
and RGO.

Figure 3 shows the
morphology and structure of four samples with different SSAs of graphene
using a scanning electron microscope. Figure 3a shows that the G1 particle is a large number
of flakes stacked into a micrometer-sized block. The particle size
of G3 (Figure 3c) aggregation
is significantly smaller than that of G2 (Figure 3b), and G3 is more evenly distributed than
G2. Furthermore, the G1 particle size is obviously larger than those
of the other two particles. With a longer processing time and an increase
of the SSA, the particle size decreases. The image of RGO (Figure 3d) shows a typical
wrinkled and corrugated laminar structure film. RGO thin films have
some structural disorders rather than the ideal monolayer so that
their effective SSA becomes smaller. The flexible porous structure
of graphene facilitates the full contact between the electrolyte and
the surface of the electrode material and promotes the uniform distribution
of PbSO4 particles during deep charge–discharge
cycles.

Figure 3 SEM images of (a) graphene 1, (b) graphene 2, (c) graphene 3, and
(d) RGO.

The Raman spectra of graphene
in Figure 4 consist
of two typical Raman bands of carbons:
the D band at 1336 cm–1 is due to defects and disordered
carbon and the G band at 1581 cm–1 is used to characterize
the structure of the sp2-hybridized carbon atom. Comparing
spectra in Figure 4a, 4b, and 4c, the
defect-related D peak is increasingly higher. With the increase of
processing time, the SSA and pore volume increased, so the defect
degree of the samples is also increased. In Figure 4d, the D peak intensity of RGO is apparently
higher than that of the other three patterns in that only a portion
of sp3-hybridized carbon atoms are reduced to sp2-hybridized carbon atoms after redox, a lot of defects resulting
in the degree of disorder of the RGO structure increases, accordingly
the D peak is relatively high. In addition, a 2D peak appears at 2658
cm–1 of the spectra, and the number of graphene
layers can be distinguished by observing the intensity ratio of the
2D and the G band peaks in the samples.32 It is found in the figures that the intensity of the G band is much
stronger than that of the 2D band peak, corresponding to multilayered
graphene, which is confirmed by TEM observations.

Figure 4 Raman spectra of (a)
graphene 1, (b) graphene 2, (c) graphene 3,
and (d) RGO.

The microscopic structure
of four kinds of graphene is further
studied by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Figure 5a–c further verifies that the particle
sizes of G1, G2, and G3 decrease with increasing mechanical exfoliation
processing time. As can be seen from Figure 5a, the particle size of G1 is the largest
and structurally complete. The particle size of G2 (Figure 5b) is noticeably smaller than
that of G1, but the agglomeration is rather serious. However, the
particle size of G3 (Figure 5c) is smaller than that of G2, but the stacking is more serious
and a great quantity of small particles disorderly stacked together.
This characterization is consistent with the SEM observation. RGO
(Figure 5d) displays
a disordered, transparent, and wrinkled gauze shape, which indicates
that the sheet is thinner. The HRTEM images (Figure 5a1–d1) show that the four graphene
samples have multiple graphene sheets, which are consistent with the
Raman spectra. The number of layers of graphene decreases with a longer
processing time. In addition, the RGO film is large and complete with
obvious folds and stack of partial sheets to form a multilayered structure.
It implies that the graphene film prepared by the Hummers’
method is thinner than the graphene prepared by the processing method.

3.2 VRLA Battery Tests
After assembly,
the batteries were tested for performance. Four types of graphene
materials were used as negative electrode additives for VRLA batteries
in a concentration of 0.3 wt %. The batteries with acetylene black
were used as control batteries. It is well-known that acetylene black
has a SSA of about 20 m2 g–1 and a conductivity
of around 2 × 103 S/m. Table 1 shows the types of VRLA batteries used in
this work.

3.2.1 Discharge Capacity (Room and Low Temperatures)
The discharge capacity and discharge time of VRLA batteries at
room and low temperatures with different graphene materials are compared
to those of the control batteries with acetylene black, as shown in Figure 6. Batteries were
discharged to a 42 V cutoff voltage at a constant current of 10 A
to measure the 2 h discharge capacity at room temperature; Figure 6a shows the discharge
time for the third cycle. The actual discharge capacity of the batteries
is calculated by multiplying the discharge current by the duration
of the discharge. National standards stipulate that the actual capacity
of qualified batteries is greater than the rated capacity; that is,
the discharge time is over 120 min. It can be seen from the figure
that the discharge times of the batteries with graphene are longer
than those of the control batteries. Moreover, when G2 is added, the
discharge capacity of batteries is the highest and the discharge time
is 132 min, which is 4 min longer than that of the control batteries.
Compared with the control batteries, the discharge times of the batteries
with graphene have an extension of 1–3%. Experimental results
show that the discharge capacities of graphene-containing batteries
are larger than those of the control batteries, which are attributed
to the much larger SSA of graphene.

Figure 6 Room-temperature and low-temperature performance
of VRLA (48 V
20 A h) batteries with graphene additives with different SSAs. (a)
Results of 2 h capacity tests (10 A discharge until voltage 42 V at
25 °C) showing that the discharge times of graphene-containing
batteries are larger than those of the control cells. (b) Discharge
performance tests at −15 °C temperature and (c) charge
and discharge performance tests at −10 °C temperature
showing greater improvement when graphene was added to batteries compared
to control batteries. (d) Effect of graphene on large-current discharge
performance. Results of large current tests (36 A discharges until
voltage 42 V) showing that the discharge times of the batteries containing
graphene in the negative electrode are slightly higher than those
of the control batteries.

There are two kinds of low-temperature performance tests:
one is
the room-temperature charge and low-temperature discharge (−15
°C) and the other is low-temperature charge and low-temperature
discharge (−10 °C). Low-temperature capacity performance
of batteries is related to the working performance of the batteries
in a low-temperature environment. If the discharge capacity of a battery
at low temperatures is less than the standard (≥85 min), the
battery will be less effective in winter conditions, especially in
locations such as northern China. As a consequence, the state mileage
performance at low temperatures is much worse than that at room temperature.
Therefore, it is necessary to improve the low-temperature performance
of the battery. Figure 6b indicates that the discharge times of the batteries with graphene
are significantly higher than those of the control batteries at a
low temperature of −15 °C (charged at room temperature).
The discharge time of the G3 batteries is 5 min longer than that of
the control batteries, and the discharge times of batteries with G1,
G2, G3, and RGO are very similar. The discharge times for batteries
with graphene and acetylene black additives after five cycles (charge
and discharge) at a low temperature of −10 °C are shown
in Figure 6c. The four
batteries with graphene additives have the same discharge time. A
significant improvement of 9% is observed in the discharge times of
batteries with graphene when compared to control batteries, indicating
that graphene additives have a better low-temperature performance,
can be recharged faster, and have longer life in a low-temperature
environment.

Comparing the discharge performance at room temperature
and low
temperature, it is clear that the capacity at a low temperature is
reduced compared to that at room temperature. This is because of poor
electrolyte fluidity, slow chemical reaction, and an increase in battery
internal resistance at low temperatures.

3.2.2 Larger
Current Discharge (1.8C2)
When
the e-bike is started, the discharge
current will exceed 1C discharge, which also affects
the battery life. Accordingly, it is of great significance to study
the large-current discharge performance of the battery. It is observed
from Figure 6d that
the discharge time of the batteries with graphene under 1.8C2 (36 A) current is 29 min, representing an
improvement in large-current discharge performance compared with the
control batteries. When a large current is discharged, the capacity
drops particularly rapidly because the reaction occurs only on the
surface of the active materials on the plate. Moreover, the formation
of large lead sulfate particles on the surface of the negative plate
hinders the contact of the internal active materials with the electrolyte.33 Consequently, lead–acid batteries can
cope with short periods of large current discharge, but the capacity
for continuous discharge under large current is poor.

3.2.3 Charge Acceptance
Charge acceptance
is an important performance of VRLA batteries for e-bike applications.
The high charge acceptance ratio ensures the normal use of the battery
and prolongs the battery cycling life. Figure 7a shows that the charge acceptance ratio, Ica/I2 (I2 is the 2 h-rated current), value of G3 batteries is
about 28.5% higher than that of the control batteries. A higher Ica/I2 value indicates
that the battery has better charge acceptance.34 The charge acceptance of batteries with graphene is higher
than that of the control batteries. The results show that the charge
acceptance of batteries with high-SSA graphene is greater than that
of those with low-SSA graphene. Accordingly, the best charge acceptance
performance comes from G3 with the highest SSA.25 A graphene material with a large SSA improves the electrochemical
active area of NAM, which is beneficial to the dissolution of PbSO4 and the reduction of Pb2+ and the improvement
of charge acceptance of batteries.23,35 The RGO has
the smallest SSA; however, the charge acceptance of RGO batteries
was only slightly lower than that of G3 batteries. This is probably
because the RGO films have a unique flexible porous structure and
the sheets are thin and complete, which facilitates the transport
of hydrogen sulfate ions and electrolyte, promotes the even distribution
of PbSO4 particles, and improves the utilization rate of
active mass.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of graphene on charge acceptance performance.
The results
showing that the charge acceptance ratios of graphene incorporated
in batteries are apparently higher than those of the control batteries,
and the charge acceptance ratio of batteries added with the graphene
3 is the highest. (b) Effect of graphene on the cycle life curves
of VRLA (48 V/20 A h) batteries under 100% DoD test conditions at
high-rate (10 A) discharge. The relationship between the discharge
time and the number of cycles with graphene with four different SSAs
as negative additives and carbon black as a control battery additive
is shown.

3.3 Cycle
Life in a 100% DoD Condition
Cycle life is one of the key
battery performance parameters. Cycle
life is defined as the number of complete charge–discharge
cycles that an e-bike battery can perform before its capacity drops
to below 80% of the nominal capacity (i.e., discharge time is 96 min).
The cycle life of the batteries is required to be not less than 250
times, and those that do not meet this requirement are rated unqualified
batteries. The effect of graphene with different SSAs on the cycle
life of VRLA batteries under 100% DoD at C2 discharge rate is shown in Figure 7b. The control batteries show a sharp decline in the
discharge time within 250 cycles, which is a typical level of the
state-of-the-art technologies for VRLA batteries of 12 V 20 A h on
e-bike duty. This may be because the charge acceptance of the control
batteries is poor, and the water loss is significant during the cycling,
causing premature capacity loss and accelerating battery failure.36,37 However, the batteries with graphene in the negative plate achieved
380 cycles. Variation trends of the G1 and G2 batteries are basically
the same. The G3 and RGO batteries generally display a similar superior
cycling. In addition, the discharge time of G3 and RGO batteries remained
stable within 300 cycles, but the discharge time dropped rapidly after
300 cycles, which may be due to electrolyte stratification.37 With increasing numbers of the battery cycles,
the internal resistance of the batteries increases continuously during
the discharge process because of the consumption of electrolytes and
the decrease of active materials. Important to this is the accumulation
of lead sulfate crystals with poor conductivity on the negative plates
during the discharge process. Furthermore, during the last 20 cycles,
the batteries may be in the critical state of thermal runaway because
of the excessive water loss of electrolyte.7

According to the above results, it is clear that the VRLA
batteries with graphene can not only increase charge acceptance of
the batteries but also suppress the sulfation of the negative plates
during deep cycling.30 Moreover, the cycle
life of the batteries with graphene improved by 52% compared to that
of the control batteries under a 100% DoD condition. These results
are attributed to graphene having better conductivity and larger SSA
than acetylene black.

3.4 Water Loss Performance
The main reason
for the failure of the long-life batteries is the loss of water, which
is caused by gassing output. The electrolysis of water occurs during
battery charging, and then the hydrogen evolution reaction occurs
on the negative electrode. Carbon additives typically reduce the hydrogen
overpotential, resulting in more gassing output. It is important to
determine the influence of graphene additives on water loss.

At the end of charging, PbSO4 is substantially reduced
to Pb (reaction I). The excess charge current
will decompose the water in the electrolyte, the oxygen gas generated
at the positive plate (reaction II) is transported
to the negative plate, and the oxygen recombination reaction occurs
at the negative electrode (reaction III). However,
if the charging current is too large, the oxygen recombination reaction
at the negative plate will not keep up with the rate of oxygen evolution,
and the gas will open the exhaust valve and cause water loss. On the
other hand, hydrogen evolution (reaction IV)
occurs on the negative plate of the battery. The positive plate cannot
absorb hydrogen, and finally, it will also discharge the gas chamber
and cause the loss of water. In the charging process, the positive
and negative reactions are as follows:

On the negative electrode, I  

On the positive electrode, II   III   IV  

Figure 8 presents
the amount of water loss during the cycling process. As the number
of cycles increases, the battery water loss also increased. However,
in batteries with graphene, the water loss was slightly increased
compared with the control batteries. While the graphene may exacerbate
the water loss during the late stage of the cycles, the results show
that the amount of water lost by the batteries containing graphene
is within a controllable range, with no significant differences from
the control batteries. After 350 cycles, the water loss of the batteries
reached 28.3–29 g. It is possible that the water loss of batteries
increases the concentration of acid, accelerates the sulfation of
the negative plate, reduces the batteries capacity, shortens the cycle
life of batteries, and even causes the thermal runaway of batteries.38

number of
cycles. Water loss tests showing that batteries containing graphene
perform similarly to control batteries.

3.5 Mechanism of Adding Graphene on the Negative
Plate
On the basis of the above results, we proposed a possible
mechanism for extending the battery life from 250 to 380 cycles after
adding graphene. The battery for e-bikes is required to charge and
discharge in deep cycle duty under a 100% DoD condition. Uneven lead
sulfate crystals continuously accumulate on the negative plate, forming
small PbSO4 crystals with high solubility, whereas big
lead sulfate crystals with lower solubility will be recrystallized
into larger PbSO4 crystals.39,40 It is well-known
that acetylene black has a small spherical structure. When acetylene
black (Figure 9a) is
added as a negative additive, a point-to-point contact forms between
acetylene black particles and PbSO4 particles. However,
when graphene (Figure 9b) is added to the negative plate, PbSO4 becomes smaller
and results in a uniform distribution because of the formation of
a surface-to-point contact between graphene and PbSO4 particles.
It is possible that graphene is a two-dimensional sheet structure
that can form a continuous conductive network structure, which is
helpful for forming small-sized and uniform distribution of lead sulfate
crystals with high solubility and facilitating the diffusion of electrolyte
from the surface to the interior of the plate.14,41 The contact area between graphene and lead sulfate particles (surface-to-point)
is much larger than that of acetylene black and lead sulfate particles
(point-to-point). Therefore, graphene additives can better restrict
the growth of lead sulfate crystals on the negative plate and prolong
the cycle life of the battery.

Figure 9 (a,b) Schematic diagram of acetylene black
and graphene on the
negative plate under a 100% DoD condition, respectively. (c) Schematic
diagram of electron migration through the Pb and carbon interfaces
in the negative plate.

In the deep cycle duty, the electrochemical reaction process
occurs
not only on the lead surface of the NAM but also on the surface of
graphene.41,42 This probably corresponds to the parallel
mechanism42 on both Pb and graphene surfaces,
which retards sulfation of the negative plates and prolongs the cycle
life of the batteries. Figure 9c shows a schematic diagram of electron migration through
Pb and carbon interfaces in the negative plate. During the reaction
process, a lead sulfate passivation layer forms on the surface of
lead, while the passivation layer of lead sulfate impedes the migration
of electrons and increases the charge-transfer resistance (R1) of the Pb/H2SO4 interface.15,42 However, there is no lead sulfate barrier layer on the C/H2SO4 interface, and thus the resistance of electrons through
this interface (R2) is smaller, so R2 < R1. Hence,
the electric current through the C/H2SO4 interface
is much larger than that passing through the Pb/H2SO4 interface (IC > IPb). Compared to acetylene black, 2D graphene sheet with
a larger contact area on the Pb surface plays a more important role
for the electron transfer and thus accelerates the electrochemical
reduction of Pb2+ ion. Thus, the effect of electrocatalyst
on the charge reaction42 is more valid
for graphene added to the negative plate.

4 Conclusions
In summary, graphene nanoplatelets with different SSAs and RGO
materials were employed as the negative additives of e-bike motive
power VRLA batteries. The effects of graphene addition to the NAM
of the batteries were investigated by large current discharge, charge
acceptance, cycling performance, and water loss tests. The results
show that the addition of graphene to the batteries can improve large-current
discharge performance and increase low-temperature performance, promote
charge acceptance, and lengthen 100% DoD cycle life by 52%, as compared
to the control batteries with acetylene black additives. Moreover,
the water loss problems of the batteries with graphene are in a controllable
range. In addition, the batteries with the highest SSA of G3 and RGO
exhibit the most stable cycle performance and a better charge acceptance
stability, compared to the batteries with G2 and G1. These excellent
properties were derived from G3 with a larger SSA and pore volume.
A higher SSA enhances electrochemical active surface, suppresses the
irreversible sulfation of the negative plate, and improves charge
acceptance of the negative plate during charging and cycle performance.
While the SSA of RGO film is small, the sheets are thin and complete
and have abundant pore structure. The significant improvement in battery
performances can be attributed to the addition of graphene on the
negative plate to promote the reduction of PbSO4 to Pb
during charging and to resist the accumulation of lead sulfate during
cycling. We wish to emphasize that this is the first report on improving
battery performance in e-bikes by using graphene as an additive.
