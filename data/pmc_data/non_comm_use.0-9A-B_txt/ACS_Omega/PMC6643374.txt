This paper reports
the development of robust Pd- and Ru-containing
magnetically recoverable catalysts in a one-pot procedure using commercially
available, branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) as capping and reducing
agent. For both catalytic metals, ∼3 nm nanoparticles (NPs)
are stabilized in the PEI shell of magnetite NPs, whose aggregation
allows for prompt magnetic separation. The catalyst properties were
studied in a model reaction of 4-nitrophenol hydrogenation to 4-aminophenol
with NaBH4. A similar catalytic NP size allowed us to decouple
the NP size impact on the catalytic performance from other parameters
and to follow the influence of the catalytic metal type and amount
as well as the PEI amount on the catalytic activity. The best catalytic
performances, the 1.2 min–1 rate constant and the
433.2 min–1 turnover frequency, are obtained for
the Ru-containing catalyst. This is discussed in terms of stability
of Ru hydride facilitating the surface-hydrogen transfer and the presence
of Ru4+ species on the Ru NP surface facilitating the nitro
group adsorption, both leading to an increased catalyst efficiency.
High catalytic activity as well as the high stability of the catalyst
performance in five consecutive catalytic cycles after magnetic separation
makes this catalyst promising for nitroarene hydrogenation reactions.

Introduction
Nanoparticulate catalysts
bearing magnetic nanoparticles (NPs)
along with catalytic NPs received considerable attention because of
added capability of magnetic recovery, resulting in greener routes,
energy preservation, and less-expensive target products.1−9 Different capping molecules or supports have been used to stabilize
catalytic and magnetic NPs, including various polymers.10−20 Polymer-containing functional groups allow for coordination with
metal species and stabilization of the forming NP surface. However,
to ensure accessibility to catalytic centers, the polymer should form
a nondense shell around the catalytic NPs. It was documented that
branched polymers/copolymers as stabilizing molecules allow for a
better access to catalytic NPs and higher catalytic activities compared
to linear polymers.14,21−23

Branched
polyethyleneimine (PEI) has been explored for the stabilization
of catalytic24−28 or catalytic/magnetic NPs29−31 in the development of various
hydrophilic catalysts. These catalysts can be used in water or alcohols
for important green chemistry reactions such as dehydrogenation,27 reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP),29,31 the Tsuji–Trost reaction,30 one-pot
synthesis of 2-amino-3-cyano-4H-pyran derivatives
via a multicomponent reaction,28 and so
forth. In a number of cases, magnetic NPs were preformed and then
coated with PEI28,29 or added to the premade catalytic
nanocomposite,30,31 leading to a multistep catalyst
preparation.

Here, we report the development of a family of
nanoparticulate,
magnetically recoverable catalysts based on commercially available,
branched PEI. The catalyst components including magnetite and catalytic
NPs are formed in a one-pot procedure and stabilized by PEI. The activity
of the catalysts synthesized has been tested in a model reaction—the
reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with an excess of NaBH4—allowing one to compare catalysts suitable for a nitro
group hydrogenation.32−34 It is noteworthy that 4-AP is a building block in
organic syntheses including the industrial synthesis of paracetamol.35

There are numerous studies of this reaction
using heterogeneous
catalysts containing transition metals (Au, Pd, Ag, Ru, etc.).34,36−43 It was demonstrated that the catalytic activity in the case of NPs
strongly depends on a number of parameters such as NP size, structure,
stabilizing molecules, support, environment, and so forth.44−48 Various magnetically recoverable catalysts for the 4-NP reduction
have been reported,41,49−51 but in the
majority of cases, the catalyst synthesis requires several steps,
making it a complicated process.

In this work, the PEI-based
magnetically recoverable catalyst containing
Ru NPs showed exceptional activity in the 4-NP reduction exceeding
that of other reported catalysts by ∼58%.20 Excellent catalytic properties, sustainable preparation
conditions, and easy magnetic recovery make these robust catalysts
promising for nitroarene hydrogenation processes.

Results and Discussion
Catalyst
Syntheses
Syntheses of the magnetically recoverable
catalysts containing Pd or Ru species were carried out in a one-pot
solvothermal procedure (Figure 1). In the first step, iron oxide NPs are formed by the thermal
decomposition of Fe(acac)3 in the presence of PEI as the
capping polymer at the triethylene glycol (TEG) boiling temperature.

Figure 1 Schematic
representation of the catalyst synthesis.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the sample
isolated at this stage (Figure S1a, the Supporting Information) shows the formation of NP aggregates that ensures
fast magnetic separation. The individual NP diameter in this sample
is 9.6, but it can vary between 8.6 and 10.0 depending on the amount
and the molecular weight of PEI used (Table S1, Supporting Information). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of IO-PEI (Figure S1b, Supporting Information) shows a set of reflections which are typical of spinel and thus
magnetite.52,53 However, the resemblance of the
XRD patterns of both magnetite and maghemite NPs due to line broadening
makes this assignment tentative. This hypothesis is based on the inert
medium and the presence of PEI, which is both reducing and stabilizing
agent,54,55 so the partial reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is quite likely. The crystallite size from the
Scherrer equation is 8.8 nm, which is close to the NP size.

After iron oxide NPs are prefabricated, the reaction temperature
was lowered to 60 °C before the addition of a catalytic metal
compound to let the latter coordinate with amino groups of PEI for
about 24 h. Subsequently, the reaction temperature was increased to
TEG boiling and the catalytic metal compound was allowed to decompose/reduce.
If the metal precursor is added at the TEG boiling temperature, very
large Pd or Ru NPs are formed, which are unattached to the iron oxide
NPs (the image is not shown). This is very different from the synthesis
of Pd- and Pt-containing magnetically recoverable catalysts formed
in the presence of hydrophobic polymers in benzyl ether, where the
Pd and Pt compound solutions were injected at ∼285 °C
and ∼3 nm Pd and Pt NPs were stabilized in the polymer shell
of Fe3O4 NPs.12 Apparently,
TEG (a strongly coordinating solvent) interacts with catalytic metal
species, preventing immediate coordination with the PEI amino groups.
After the coordination of metal ions with PEI and the decomposition
of Pd acetate at 285 °C, the catalytic NPs are formed in the
PEI shell of iron oxide NP aggregates (Figure 1). The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
data (see Figure S2 and the text in Supporting Information) show that the NH2-scissoring band of
PEI is significantly perturbed after the nanocomposite formation,
indicating the interaction with NPs present in the nanocomposite.

Structure of Pd-Containing Catalysts
Figure 2a shows a typical TEM image
of a Pd-containing magnetically recoverable catalyst (IO-Pd-2) prepared
with 0.1 mmol of Pd acetate (Table 1). Iron oxide NP aggregates are preserved and show
two populations of NPs with mean diameters of 10.5 and 3.2 nm, which
we tentatively assigned to Fe3O4 and Pd NPs,
respectively. The XRD diffraction pattern of this sample (Figure 2b) shows a set of
reflections typical for magnetite (see Figure S1b, Supporting Information) and a very broad signal marked in
red which could be assigned to the (111) reflection of Pd0.56 The Fe3O4 crystallite
size is 9.6 nm, which is in good agreement with the TEM data. The
Pd crystallite size cannot be determined due to a broad signal and
overlap with a weak reflection from magnetite.

(b) are for the Pd reflection, while black notations are for spinel
reflections. Red arrows in (a) show small, potentially Pd NPs.

The high-resolution
(HR) TEM image of IO-Pd-2 is presented in Figure
S3 (Supporting Information). It clearly
shows crystalline lattice of both Pd (smaller) and Fe3O4 (larger) NPs. The scanning TEM (STEM) dark-field image of
IO-Pd-2 (Figure 3a)
demonstrates that Pd NPs (brighter spots due to a higher electron
density) are located on/in the Fe3O4 NP aggregates
(larger gray spots). Moreover, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) maps of Fe and O (Figure 3) fully coincide, while the Pd map has a different shape,
indicating that Pd NPs most probably do not contain oxygen. It is
noteworthy that Pd NPs tend to cluster in the Fe3O4 NP aggregates but they are not aggregated and should be available
for a substrate in a catalytic reaction.

and EDS maps of IO-Pd-2 for (b) Fe, (c)
O, (d) Pd, (e) Fe–O mix, and (f) Fe–Pd mix.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been
employed to evaluate
the catalyst composition and further elucidate its structure (Figure 4). The HR XPS Fe
2p spectrum of IO-Pd-2 (Figure 4a) displays a main peak at a BE of 710.5 eV, characteristic
of iron oxides.57 A satellite, which might
be seen for Fe3+ ions at a BE higher than the main peak,
is lacking, demonstrating excess of the Fe3+ species beyond
the magnetite Fe3+/Fe2+ = 2:1 ratio.58−60 In the case of Fe3O4, the Fe3+ and
Fe2+ satellites result in a plateau between the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks,61 similar to our case. The HR XPS Pd 3d spectrum (Figure 4b) was deconvoluted into a
single peak in the Pd 3d region with a BE of 335.2 eV, which is characteristic
of Pd0.62−64 This is in good agreement with the XRD data.

are presented in Tables S2 and S3 (Supporting Information).

Structure of Ru-Containing Catalysts
The TEM image
and XRD pattern of the Ru-containing catalyst prepared with 100 μmol
of RuCl3 are shown in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Similar to the Pd-containing sample, a population
of small (∼3.0 nm) NPs is seen in the TEM image, but the XRD
pattern shows only reflections of magnetite, indicating that Ru-containing
NPs are amorphous. The STEM dark-field image of IO-Ru-3 (Figure 5a) displays brighter
spots on the iron oxide aggregates, which could be assigned to NPs
with a higher electron contrast due to the Ru presence. The Ru NP
images are not resolved on the Ru map because of the low Ru content
and the NP close proximity, but they are clearly located in/on the
Fe3O4 NP aggregate.

Figure 5 (a) STEM dark-field image
and EDS maps of IO-Ru-3 for (b) Fe, (c)
O, (d) Ru, (e) Fe–O mix, and (f) Fe–Ru mix.

The HR XPS spectrum of IO-Ru-3 in the Ru 3d region
is shown in Figure 6. The deconvolution
of the Ru 3d spectrum shows two components with BEs of 279.80 and
280.61 eV, which are assigned to Ru0 and Ru4+, respectively, with the ratio of Ru0/Ru4+ =
7:1 (Table S4, Supporting Information).
The BE values obtained are in good agreement with those reported for
Ru NPs.65 It has been reported that RuO2 forms on the Ru0 NP surface upon exposure to air.66 The assignments of the C 1s spectrum deconvolution
(it overlaps with the Ru 3d spectrum) are presented in Table S4 (Supporting Information). The HR XPS Fe 2p (not
shown) of IO-Ru-3 is very similar to that of IO-Pd-2 (Figure 4), indicating the magnetite
NP surface.

Figure 6 HR XPS Ru 3d spectrum of IO-Ru-3. In the Ru 3d region, the deconvolution
peaks at 279.80 and 283.97 eV are assigned to Ru0, while
the peaks at 280.61 and 284.1 eV are ascribed to Ru4+.
In the C 1s region, the peak at 284.81 eV is due to C–C of
PEI and adventitious carbon, the peak at 285.92 is due to C–N
of PEI, the peaks at 286.25 and 288.16 eV are due to C–OH and
COOH, respectively.67 Oxygen containing
groups are most likely due to adsorption of CO and CO2 from
atmosphere. The deconvolution data are presented in Table S4.

Catalytic Data
The catalytic properties of the nanocomposites
synthesized were tested in the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP with excess
of NaBH4 (Table 2). This is a model reaction, which is normally used to compare
catalysts. It is noteworthy that in the absence of a catalyst or in
the presence of iron oxide NPs stabilized by PEI, 4-NP is not reduced
at an appreciable rate by sodium borohydride. In the presence of the
catalyst, the reaction proceeds very quickly, forming 4-AP. Considering
that in all nanocomposites both Pd and Ru NP sizes are nearly the
same (∼3 nm), the NP size influence was decoupled from other
parameters, allowing us to evaluate the influence of the catalytic
metal type and the catalytic metal and polymer loading on the activity
of the catalysts synthesized.

A significant absorption peak
at 315 nm appears in the absorption
spectrum of pure 4-NP (not shown). Upon addition of the NaBH4 aqueous solution to the 4-NP, the absorption peak position shifts
to 400 nm because of the formation of 4-nitrophenolate ions. After
the addition of 4-NP in the reaction medium containing a catalyst,
the reduction of 4-NP began. It was monitored utilizing UV–vis
spectroscopy and following a continuing decrease in intensity of the
400 nm peak, which is accompanied by the appearance of a new peak
at 301 nm, characteristic for 4-AP.68 Typical
UV–vis spectra of the reaction progression for Pd- and Ru-containing
catalysts with different amounts of catalytic metals are shown in
Figure S5 (Supporting Information). It
is noteworthy that the reaction occurred very fast and no induction
period was observed. It was reported that the induction period is
caused by the dynamic restructuring of the NP surface.32,34 Apparently, no restructuring takes place in the case of the catalysts
studied in this work because the catalytic NP surface is already modified
with NH and NH2 groups of PEI.

To determine the rate
constant of each reaction, a graph of ln(At/A0) versus time was
plotted (see example for IO-Pd-2 in Figure S6, Supporting Information). A linear function that
fits the data was added and the negative of the slope was determined
to be the rate constant. The rate constants characterizing the catalyst
activity in the 4-NP reduction and turnover frequency (TOF) values
calculated using elemental analysis data are presented in Table 2.

The Table 2 data
show that the rate constants depend on the catalytic metal type and
metal and polymer loading. An increase of the polymer loading by ∼33%
leads to slowing the reaction by 60 and 90% for Ru- and Pd-containing
catalysts, respectively. This is most likely due to poor access of
the substrate to the catalytic centers under the thicker polymer coating.
When the loading of Pd was doubled, the rate constant of the reaction
increased but only by ∼64%. This could be caused by NPs shielding
each other at the higher Pd loading. Taking this information into
account, the Ru-containing catalysts were obtained at lower metal
compound loadings: 0.05 and 0.1 mmol of Ru.

The most notable
difference in the rate constants was observed
for different catalytic metals, Pd and Ru, with the latter being ∼1.5
times more active than the former (comparing rate constants), while
the TOF values differ by a factor of 8.7. The literature data for
Pd- and Ru-containing catalysts are not consistent with the above
finding which could be assigned to several factors. Liu et al. compared
catalytic efficiency of click-dendrimer-stabilized late transition
metal NPs in 4-NP reduction.69 The highest
rate constant was found for Rh, while the second best performance
was demonstrated for Pd. The Ru NPs showed a much lower rate. It is
noteworthy, however, that the NP sizes were different for different
metals and the data for Pd NPs were obtained in earlier work.70 In our study, the NP sizes are ∼3 nm
for Ru- and Pd-containing catalysts, so the higher activity of Ru-containing
catalysts is not due to the NP size difference. In order to understand
the possible causes of such a behavior, we considered differences
between the two metals taking into account a well-established mechanism
in terms of the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model for the reduction
of 4-NP with the NaBH4 excess.32,34 The borohydride ions formed by hydrolysis of NaBH4 transfer
surface-hydrogen in a reversible manner to the NP surface. At the
same time, 4-NP is also adsorbed on the surface and the rate-determining
step involves the reduction of 4-NP by the surface-hydrogen species.32,34

We assume that when hydrogen species are transferred to the
metal
surface, most probably metal hydride complexes are formed. One of
the possible explanations of the higher activity of the Ru-containing
catalysts is a higher probability for transfer of the hydrogen species
to the nitro group of 4-NP because of stability of Ru hydride complexes.
In contrast to the abundant and frequently characterized ruthenium
hydrides,71 palladium hydrides are rarer
and often used more as solid state materials for capture and sensing
of H2.72,73 The other likely cause of the
higher activity is the presence of Ru4+ species on Ru NPs,
which should be beneficial for the nitro group adsorption because
of Lewis acid properties, thus facilitating hydrogenation. The presence
of magnetite NPs in close proximity to catalytic NPs may enable the
4-NP adsorption for both Pd- and Ru-containing catalysts, thus facilitating
the catalytic reaction with magnetically recoverable catalysts. This
could be due to hydrogen spillover, as was recently demonstrated even
for nonreducible supports.74

To study
the catalyst recovery and performance in the repeated
catalytic reactions, we carried out consecutive catalytic experiments
with the same catalyst load, separating the reaction solution using
a rare earth magnet (Figure S7, Supporting Information), sonicating the catalyst in the cuvette in water for 15 min and
adding new portions of NaBH4 and 4-NP. The data (see Tables S5 and S6) demonstrate remarkable stability
of the catalyst performance in five consecutive reactions. Moreover,
the ICP analysis of the supernatants after first and fifth reactions
shows only traces of Ru or Fe: below 0.03 ppm for Ru and 0.42 ppm
for Fe, indicating that at least 97.5% of Ru has been retained in
the catalyst.

It is noteworthy that the catalyst separation
occurs within 60
s, but if sonication is not used before the following reaction, the
catalyst activity drops by ∼20%, indicating that the catalyst
is aggregated on the stir bar upon magnetic separation and needs to
be redispersed to maintain its activity.

Conclusions
Robust
magnetically recoverable nanocomposites containing ∼3
nm Pd or Ru NPs and stabilized by commercially available branched
PEI have been synthesized using a one-pot procedure and characterized
by a combination of physicochemical methods. PEI functions as a stabilizing
support for the nanocomposite, allowing for coordination with catalytic
metal ions, their reduction and stabilization of magnetite and catalytic
NPs. XPS revealed that Pd NPs consist solely of Pd0, while
Ru NPs contain both Ru0 and Ru4+ with the ratio
Ru0/Ru4+ = 7:1, indicating partial surface oxidation
of the Ru NPs. STEM EDS mapping showed that for both Pd- and Ru-containing
nanocomposites, Pd or Ru NPs are located within magnetite NP aggregates
making them magnetically recoverable within 60 s.

It was demonstrated
that the Ru-containing nanocomposites are more
catalytically active in the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP than their Pd-containing
analogs most likely due to a facilitated surface-hydrogen transfer
and the presence of Ru4+ species, enabling the NO2 group adsorption. Considering that Ru is approximately 4.5 times
cheaper than Pd, the Ru-containing magnetic catalysts synthesized
in this work seem to be especially beneficial for hydrogenation reactions
of nitroarenes.

Synthesis of Iron Oxide NPs Stabilized by PEI
Syntheses
of iron oxide NPs in the presence of PEI were carried out according
to the following protocol. In a typical experiment, a three-neck round-bottom
flask (with elongated necks) equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a
reflux condenser, and two septa, one of which contained an inserted
temperature probe protected with a glass shield and the other had
a long inserted needle for argon bubbling, was loaded with 0.353 g
(1 mmol) of Fe(acac)3, 0.1125 g (2.613 mmol) of PEI, and
7 mL of TEG. The flask was fitted in a Glas-Col heating mantle, which
was placed on a magnetic stirrer. The mantle was attached to a digital
temperature controller. The flask was degassed by argon bubbling for
15 min under stirring. Then, the temperature was raised to 60 °C
at 10 °C/min and kept under stirring at this temperature for
30 min to allow solubilization of all reagents. Then, the temperature
was increased with a heating rate 10 °C/min, and the flask was
allowed to reflux for 1 hour at 280–285 °C. After that,
the heating mantle was removed and the flask was allowed to cool to
room temperature. For the NP isolation, a portion of the reaction
solution was placed into a test tube and precipitated with acetone
(5–10 fold excess). The mixture was then centrifuged for 15
min. Following the centrifugation, a pellet was formed and the supernatant
was removed. The sample was then washed with acetone three times,
each followed by the 15 min centrifugation and removal of the supernatant.
Then, the sample was dispersed in ethanol, followed by sonication
for 10 min. The reaction conditions for iron oxide (IO) NP syntheses
are presented in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

One-Pot Syntheses of Pd- and Ru-Containing Catalysts
In a typical experiment, first, iron oxide NPs were synthesized as
discussed above. After the 1 hour reaction, the flask was allowed
to cool to 60 °C. A solution of 0.1 mmol of Pd acetate (0.0302
g) in 1 mL of TEG was prepared in a small vial by sonication for 15
min and injected into the reaction flask. The flask was stirred at
60 °C for 24 h to allow coordination of the Pd compound with
PEI. After that, the temperature was increased to 285 °C with
a heating rate 10 °C/min and the flask was allowed to reflux
for 1 hour. After that, the heating mantle was removed and the flask
was allowed to cool to room temperature.

In the case of the
Ru-containing catalyst, a solution of 0.0206 g (0.1 mmol) of RuCl3 in 1 mL of TEG was prepared similar to the solutions of Pd
acetate. The other reaction conditions were similar to those described
above for the Pd-containing catalysts. The reaction conditions for
Pd- and Ru-containing samples are presented in Table 1.

Reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
Before
the reduction, the
catalyst was dried under vacuum overnight. The catalyst (0.7 mg) was
dispersed in 2.67 mL of H2O by sonication for 1 h. In a
cuvette, 30 μL of the catalyst dispersion, 300 μL of the
NaBH4 (10–1 M) aqueous solution, 2.64
mL of H2O, and a stir bar were combined. Then, the reaction
solution was degassed by argon bubbling for 30 min. An Agilent Cary
60 UV–vis spectrophotometer was calibrated so that the instrument
would read the spectrum from 500 to 200 nm, once every 12 s. The cuvette
prepared was zeroed on the machine for 400 nm and 30 μL of the
4-NP (10–2 M) aqueous solution (degassed by argon
bubbling) was added into the cuvette upon stirring, after which readings
were started.

High excess of NaBH4 makes the reduction
rate independent of the NaBH4 concentration; thus, the
reaction is considered of pseudo-first-order. The rate constant (k) was obtained from the slopes of the linear part of the
ln(At/A0) = −kt plots. A0 and At are
designated as the initial 4-NP concentration and the 4-NP concentration
at time t, respectively.20,32,33 The TOF values were derived from the equation:
TOF = k·n0(4-NP)/ncat, where n0(4-NP) is the initial 4-NP amount and ncat is
the molar amount of Ru or Pd in the catalyst.20 The metal contents in supernatants after magnetic separation were
measured using ICP–OES (NexION 300Q, PerkinElmer).

Characterization
TEM was utilized for imaging of all
samples. To prepare electron-transparent NP samples, a drop of a purified
solution was placed onto a carbon-coated Cu grid. All images were
acquired at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV on a JEOL JEM1010 TEM
system. HRTEM and STEM images and EDS maps were acquired at an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV on a JEOL 3200FS transmission electron microscope
equipped with an Oxford Instruments INCA EDS system. The same TEM
grids were used for all analyses.

XRD patterns were collected
using an Empyrean from PANalytical. A copper target with a scattering
wavelength of 0.154 nm generated the X-rays. Soller slits, antiscatter
slits, divergence slits, and a nickel filter were in the beam path.
During the measurement in reflection mode, the sample was spinning
with a revolution time of 2 s. The measurement was performed with
a step-size of 0.02 and a counting time of 1800 s/step.

XPS
experiments were performed using PHI Versa Probe II
instrument equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source.
The X-ray power of 50 W at 15 kV was used for a 200 micron beam size.
The instrument work function was calibrated to give a binding energy
(BE) of 84.0 eV for the Au 4f7/2 line for metallic gold,
and the spectrometer dispersion was adjusted to give BEs of 284.8,
932.7, and of 368.3 eV for the C 1s line of adventitious (aliphatic)
carbon present on the nonsputtered samples, Cu 2p3/2 and
Ag 3d5/2 photoemission lines, respectively. The PHI double
charge compensation system was used on all samples. The ultimate Versa Probe II instrumental resolution was determined to
be better than 0.125 eV using the Fermi edge of the valence band for
metallic silver. XPS spectra with an energy step of 0.1 eV were recorded
using software SmartSoft-XPS v6.3 and processed using
PHI MultiPack v9.0 at the pass energies of 23.5 eV
for Fe 2p, C 1s, Pd 3d, Ru 3d, and O 1s regions. Peaks were fitted
using GL line shapes and/or an asymmetric line shape A(0.2,0.8,0)
GL(10), that is, a combination of Gaussians and Lorentzians with 10–50%
of Lorentzian content. A Shirley background was used for curve-fitting.
The samples were prepared by drop casting of the NP solution in chloroform
on a native surface of a Si wafer.

XRF measurements to determine
the Pd and Ru contents were performed
with a Zeiss Jena VRA-30 spectrometer (Mo anode, LiF crystal analyzer
and SZ detector). Analyses were based on the Co Kα line and
a series of standards prepared by mixing 1 g of polystyrene with 10–20
mg of standard compounds. The time of data acquisition was constant
at 10 s.
