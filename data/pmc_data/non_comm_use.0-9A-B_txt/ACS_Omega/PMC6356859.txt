We have previously described the
first Bayesian machine learning
models from FDA-approved drug screens, for identifying compounds active
against the Ebola virus (EBOV). These models led to the identification
of three active molecules in vitro: tilorone, pyronaridine, and quinacrine.
A follow-up study demonstrated that one of these compounds, tilorone,
has 100% in vivo efficacy in mice infected with mouse-adapted EBOV
at 30 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal. This suggested that we can learn
from the published data on EBOV inhibition and use it to select new
compounds for testing that are active in vivo. We used these previously
built Bayesian machine learning EBOV models alongside our chemical
insights for the selection of 12 molecules, absent from the training
set, to test for in vitro EBOV inhibition. Nine molecules were directly
selected using the model, and eight of these molecules possessed a
promising in vitro activity (EC50 < 15 μM). Three
further compounds were selected for an in vitro evaluation because
they were antimalarials, and compounds of this class like pyronaridine
and quinacrine have previously been shown to inhibit EBOV. We identified
the antimalarial drug arterolane (IC50 = 4.53 μM)
and the anticancer clinical candidate lucanthone (IC50 =
3.27 μM) as novel compounds that have EBOV inhibitory activity
in HeLa cells and generally lack cytotoxicity. This work provides
further validation for using machine learning and medicinal chemistry
expertize to prioritize compounds for testing in vitro prior to more
costly in vivo tests. These studies provide further corroboration
of this strategy and suggest that it can likely be applied to other
pathogens in the future.

==== Body
Introduction
In 2014, the outbreak
of Ebola virus (EBOV) in West Africa highlighted
the direct need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs for this and other
emerging viruses1,2 and remains currently relevant.
EBOV was the causative agent responsible for over 11 3103 deaths in 10 countries, making it one of the
deadliest viral pathogens in modern human history based on the percentage
fatality.1 Although no drug has been approved
for the treatment of EBOV, multiple medium and high-throughput screens
(HTS) of large molecular libraries4−10 have identified many small molecules effective against EBOV in vitro11−13 (Table S1), but so far few have advanced
to clinical testing. This is still important as we are currently in
the midst of an EBOV outbreak in the Congo.

To date numerous
compounds have been validated in vivo1 (mouse
and or nonhuman primate), and two small
molecules are in early clinical trials (BCX443014 and favipiravir15). BCX4430
is an adenosine analog that inhibits RNA transcription, whereas favipiravir
is a nucleotide analog that inhibits viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
In contrast, several nonsmall molecule interventions have also been
brought to clinical trial, including treatments using phosphorodiamidate
morpholino oligomers16 (AVI-6002), chimeric
mouse–human antibodies,17 and a
rVSV-GP vaccine.18

Alternative approaches
to find treatments for EBOV include repurposing
FDA-approved drugs for novel therapies, and this methodology has several
advantages over the traditional de novo approach.13,19,20 These drugs are already well characterized
and much is known about their absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (ADME) and toxicity properties. These repurposed drugs
may represent a more advanced starting point for therapeutic development
as compared with new chemical entities since their safety has already
been clinically validated. It appears that most of the FDA-approved
drugs described as having EBOV activity in vitro were not dosed in
patients during the 2014 epidemic in Africa,21 likely due to their lack of availability or efficacy data in higher
order species at the time of the outbreak and their low potency, requiring
higher doses than for the original indication. A recent review summarized
many of the known pharmacological interventions for EBOV and describes
the mechanism of action of the treatment when known.1

Computational approaches have also been used to suggest
compounds
to experimentally test22−27 or propose potential key features for activity.28 Previously, Bayesian machine learning models were developed
using datasets from prior drug screens against EBOV.12 These Bayesian models were then used to score the MicroSource
Spectrum library to predict compounds that would display anti-Ebola
activity. Quinacrine, pyronaridine, and tilorone were identified using
these models, and their activities were successfully confirmed in
vitro as having good potency.29 In subsequent
studies, tilorone was also shown to have 100% efficacy at 30 mg/kg/day
when dosed intraperitoneal in a mouse model of Ebola infection.30 In vivo efficacy testing of the other two compounds
is currently ongoing. The current study was initiated to find additional,
novel compounds active against EBOV using a similar machine learning
methodology, to provide additional evidence of how this approach can
be integrated into the drug discovery paradigm for antivirals.

Results
Machine
Learning
The Assay Central Bayesian model for
EBOV cell entry had a 5-fold cross-validation receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) of 0.82, precision 0.16, recall 0.79, Specificity 0.78, F1-score
0.27, Cohen’s Kappa (CK) 0.20, and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) 0.29 (Figure 1A). The replication model had a 5-fold cross-validation ROC of 0.83,
precision 0.36, recall 0.61, Specificity 0.97, F1-score 0.45, CK 0.43,
and MCC 0.44 (Figure 1B).

Figure 1 Assay Central model ROC plots and 5-fold cross-validation statistics
for (A) entry and (B) replication Bayesian machine learning models.

To further evaluate these models,
we used recent publications as
a source of independent test sets. One described a set of compounds
identified by another computational model and then tested in vitro
which led to 14 hits with <10 μM potencies.31 Of these 14 compounds, 11 were also scored as active by
our own computational approach using the EBOV entry model (Table S2). Out of 9 compounds, 4 compounds were
found as active from another recent high-throughput screen against
EBOV and Marburg (MARV),8 which were also
predicted to be active by the same EBOV entry model (Table S3).

In summary, both 5-fold cross-validation
statistics and external
testing results on literature test sets not included in the EBOV entry
model indicated that it was able to reliably identify actives against
EBOV in vitro.

In Vitro Testing
Of the 7 known
antimalarials tested
in this study, 5 were identified as having activity against EBOV,
e.g., the ozonides such as arterolane, artemether, and artesunate.
The clinical antimalarial candidate cipargamin was cytotoxic at close
to the concentration at which it had EBOV activity, and the antimalarial
lumefantrine was inactive (Table S4 and Figure 2). Although others
have previously determined that several CNS active compounds are active
against EBOV,7,32,33 we now show that 5 antipsychotics have similar activity (Table S4 and Figure 3). In addition, we tested 5 known antivirals
(including favipiravir; an EBOV treatment candidate), and these were
determined to be inactive under the conditions used, apart from NCS
62914 which had activity (1.91 μM) (Table S5 and Figure 4). Various analogs of the previously identified EBOV-active tilorone
(Table S6) were all inactive at the concentrations
tested, and interestingly the anticancer drug lucanthone was found
to have EBOV activity (Figure 5 and Table S5). Cytotoxicity was
also assessed for the compounds tested for EBOV activity, and several
of the molecules (arterolane, lucanthone, fluphenazine, and cipargamin)
had suboptimal selectivity indexes <5 (Table 1 and Figures S1,S2).

Table 1 EBOV and Cytotoxicity Data
One of the challenges of high-throughput screening
is the identification
of compounds with promiscuous activities (frequent hitters). Several
filters or substructural alerts for Pan assay interference compounds
(PAINS)34 are now widely accessible.35−38 PAINS and other filter scores for the compounds selected for testing
were performed (Tables S7 and S8). Out
of the 12 compounds tested for PAINS, only phenothiazine and promazine
were identified by the PAINS analysis, both containing the substructure
het_thio_666_A flag.

Discussion
Even though the EBOV
was discovered in 1976, the intensive search
for potential therapeutic drugs against it is a relatively recent
occurrence and has been focused on molecules that are already approved
for other uses. In 2013, an assay developed previously39 was used to screen multiple molecular probes,
FDA-approved and other drugs approved outside of the U.S. and identified
several compounds with activity against Ebola Zaire virus.4 These molecules included selective estrogen receptor
antagonists: clomiphene, toremifene, tamoxifen, and raloxifene as
well as diethylstilbestrol. Several estrogen receptor agonists also
had EBOV antiviral activity. The same group screened a library of
2600 drugs in vitro and found 30 compounds selected for further testing,
and 4 compounds were followed up in vivo.5 Kouznetsova et al. screened 600 FDA-approved drugs in an assay that
identifies compounds that block Ebola virus-like particles (VLP) entry
into host cells and identified 23 compounds including microtubule
inhibitors.40 A screen of 1280 FDA-approved
drugs using a pseudovirus, based on the Zaire strain of Ebola virus
with a GP/HIV core containing firefly luciferase reporter gene, identified
teicoplanin and toremiphene as EBOV inhibitors.9 In short, many groups have used high- and medium-throughput
screens to identify approved drugs and additional compounds.6−8,10,41−44 These may now number several hundred potential compounds which provides
the opportunity to build and test computational models for predicting
new anti-EBOV small molecules.

For some of these molecules,
the mechanism has been studied and
partially identified, with some having various direct viral effects
and or some indirect host effects. Several molecule types with dual
action against EBOV have been shown to modulate the innate immune
system, such as topoisomerase II inhibitors, which both induce interferon
responses and suppress replication of the virus.45 Other compounds could affect the viral life-cycle, including
the assembly and or budding of the virus.46 The various high-throughput screens have identified FDA-approved
drugs belonging to numerous classes (G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
antagonists,7 the selective estrogen receptor
modulators,4 antidepressants,32 L-type calcium channel inhibitors,47 antimalarials11,12) with in vitro
and/or in vivo growth inhibitory activities against EBOV. For example,
three FDA-approved ion channel blockers (amiodarone, dronedarone,
and verapamil) were found to have μM EBOV cellular entry inhibition
in vitro.47 Several of these compounds
had been shown to be effective against multiple filoviruses, and the
antiviral concentrations needed in vitro correlate well with in vivo
tolerated doses. Interestingly, all of these compounds have a common
tertiary amine feature.21,33,48,49 In addition, some GPCR antagonists,
including histamine neurotransmitter receptors, are potent, selective
EBOV entry inhibitors.7,33 The principal conclusion of this
is there are many different classes of EBOV inhibitors that potentially
have very different mechanisms of action. The best pathway(s) to target
is currently undetermined, which validates the continual search for
new inhibitory compounds.

We had previously generated Bayesian
models for Ebola datasets
which we used to select pyronaridine, quinacrine, and tilorone from
the MicroSource compound library for in vitro testing.50 These compounds scored highly and were not in
the machine learning model training sets.50 In vitro testing identified that these three compounds possessed
EC50 values of between 230 and 420 nM, much lower than
the positive control chloroquine (EC50 4.0 μM).12 Repeated testing of these compounds for this
study suggested slightly higher EC50 values (Table S6) than originally reported, but all possessed
low μM potency and likely reflects the different cell types
used.

A recent EBOV computational modeling publication used
a combinatorial
methodology, and an initial computational filtering of ∼17
million compounds using EBOV activity and cytotoxicity (HeLa/HEK)
models led to 14 hits with <10 μM potencies using a psuedovirus
assay.31 Five of these hits were further
evaluated in a live green fluorescent protein (GFP)-virus model and
were shown to have dose–response inhibition against EBOV infection.
Vindesine, an anticancer microtubule inhibitor, was found to be the
most potent, confirming previous work showing that microtubule inhibitor
compounds are active against EBOV.40,51 Most of the
compounds identified in this study were similar, based on Tanimoto
similarity scores (Tc), with previous
hits founds in the literature. However, six of the compounds had novel
structures as compared to other known active compounds (Tc < 0.75). Our Laplacian-corrected Naïve Bayesian
classifier models were used to score these hits. Importantly, 11 out
of the 14 compounds scored as active in our EBOV entry blocking model
(Table S2), built with ECFP6 descriptors
(842 compounds, 23 active) based on our recently published data12,52 of inhibition of pseudotype virus (GP-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis
virus-encoding (VSV) firefly luciferase). Of these molecules, vindesine
scored the highest. Our group recently screened 319 855 small
molecules against MARV pseudovirus and identified 9 compounds active
against Ebola and MARV.8 When we used our
previously developed EBOV machine learning models to predict these
same molecules, we identified 4 of the 9 compounds (that were absent
from the training set) as active (Table S3). These results suggest that our Bayesian machine learning models
can identify known active compounds that are absent from the training
set used and in addition would have found many of the compounds identified
by others.

The current study expands utilization of the machine
learning approach.
We report the identification of novel EBOV inhibitors with desirable
activities (EC50 < 10 μM and cytotoxicity >50
μM) as validation of this approach. Several of the compounds
we identified, demonstrated promising activity against EBOV, although
some had suboptimal cytotoxicity. The compounds identified have been
approved for other indications or are in clinical trials. For example,
lucanthone is an inhibitor of the DNA repair enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic
endodeoxyribonuclease (APEX1) and acts as an antineoplastic agent.53 Arterolane is an antimalarial agent and is used
as a part of a combination treatment with piperaquine and has not
previously been shown to possess antiviral activity alone.54

We have previously analyzed HTS datasets
for malaria and tuberculosis
using chemical rules as filters for flagging of undesirable molecules,
false positives, and frequent hitters from HTS screening libraries.55,56 In the current study, we used several of these methods for determining
PAINS and frequent hitters (Tables S7 and S8) and have identified phenothiazine and promazine as the only compounds
suggested to be potentially problematic out of the compounds selected
by the machine learning model. It should be noted that all of the
molecules proposed here are approved drugs or clinical candidates.
Although PAINS filters may be useful for HTS using enzymes, receptors,
etc., it remains to be seen whether they are as relevant for the repurposing
of these compounds against a different target. These are already approved
drugs or clinical candidates which have attained some degrees of validation
in vitro and in vivo, which may negate any concerns about their PAINS
status.

Our results suggest that machine learning can be used
to identify
active compounds and evaluate novel chemistries before expanding time
and resources on synthesis or purchase. An example is arterolane,
which was tested along with another clinical antimalarial candidate
cipargamin. An initial search scored two other clinical stage compounds
(KAF156 and OZ439)57 as likely actives
against EBOV. We were unable to purchase these compounds, so arterolane,
a molecule sharing a similar scaffold, was evaluated. Although our
model initially predicted arterolane as inactive, the prediction of
the analogous clinical stage compounds justified the in vitro testing
(Table S4). Arterolane also led to the
selection and EBOV testing of other commercially available antimalarials,
such as artemisinin and analogs. As arterolane is dosed as a combination
therapy with piperaquine, we also tested this for EBOV activity, and
found that this compound was inactive (Table S4). Pyronaridine, an antimalarial active against EBOV (Table S6), is used in combination with artesunate,
and we have now shown that this latter molecule has an IC50 of 8.2 μM. Although not as active as pyronaridine, it might
suggest some utility in using this, as it is already available and
approved in the EU as a combination therapy.58 These examples show that several of these compounds have poor scores
with the machine learning model, but they are still active in vitro,
which demonstrates both limitations of the model and also opportunities
for further refinement and learning.

There is scarce clinical
data on the use of antimalarial combination
therapy during an EBOV outbreak apart from a study, which showed that
artesunate–amodiaquine patients had reduced mortality vs artemether–lumefantrine.59 The basis for testing the amodiaquine regimen
was the prior discovery of its activity in vitro with an IC50 of 2.6 μM for the inhibition of virus entry in cells.12 Interestingly, our in vitro data suggests that
both artesunate and artemether are similarly active (8.21 and 6.83
μM, respectively), and this may account for the decreased mortality
and better clinical outcome for the amodiaquine–artesunate
combination. Accessibility for physical testing is clearly important.
The availability of other arterolane analogs in different labs60,61 suggests that additional efforts to understand the mechanism of
these compounds against EBOV (and increase potency) as well as pursuit
of further in vivo efficacy studies are warranted.

We have tested
several known antiviral compounds that scored well
with the EBOV machine learning models. The known anti-EBOV compound
favipiravir had no activity at the concentrations tested (Table S5) although it has been reported to have
a high IC50 (67 μM62)
and EC50 (10–63 μg/mL63). The antiviral NSC 62914, which has previously been shown to be
active against EBOV,64 had an IC50 of 1.91 μM (Table S5). Other antivirals
that lacked an activity against EBOV included MK-608 (originally developed
for Hepatitis C but was most recently repurposed for Zika virus65), acyclovir (used for herpes simplex and varicella
zoster virus66), and oseltamivir (used
for influenza A and B67). These examples
suggest that repurposing of known antivirals to target EBOV is often
difficult. The machine learning models are not perfect and would benefit
from more training data. They do appear to have some value for filtering
a broader array of drugs (not focused on known antivirals) and clinical
candidates, as we have done previously.29

One of the advantages of our approach is the integration between
machine learning and in vitro testing. Although many other groups
have performed HTS with very large numbers of compounds in pseudovirus
assays, it is not practical to perform such screens in whole cells
under BSL-4 conditions. Our strategy uses knowledge of prior screens
along with the machine learning models developed from published data
to identify potential drug candidates. Infectious virus assays offer
the advantage of knowing that the compound has in vivo potential,
whereas pseudovirus or other assays with modified virus or VLP will
still require whole cell assays before proceeding to in vivo. Our
approach therefore offers perhaps a more direct approach for getting
to in vivo testing by utilizing a whole cell infection model (e.g.,
ebola virus replication model). This also ensures that we may capture
compounds that have host effects as well as direct effects on the
virus68 which in vitro pseudovirus and
VLP entry would fail to capture. This may also be important as it
becomes increasingly recognized how EBOV manipulates the immune response
in macrophages,69 and we may need to identify
compounds that have an effect on the host.

In conclusion, our
data have shown how Bayesian machine learning
models identified hits in several recently published HTS and may assist
us in identification of further active compounds against EBOV, building
on our earlier work in this area.50

packages were purchased from PerkinElmer (PerkinElmer).

Training Datasets
A total of 842 molecules from previously
reported screens for inhibitors of the viral pseudotype entry and
EBOV replication12,52 were used to construct the computational
models. Compounds with reported IC50 values less than 50
μM were selected as actives. This high threshold for activity
was set, as there are relatively few active compounds in these two
datasets. Entry and replication models possess 43 and 23 active compounds,
respectively.

Assay Central
We utilized Assay
Central to prepare
and merge datasets collated in Molecular Notebook70 as well as generate Bayesian models of either training
data alone or combined with testing data, using the ECFP6 descriptor.71,72

The Assay Central project73−75 uses the source code
management system Git to gather and store molecular datasets from
diverse sources, in addition to scripts for curating well-defined
structure–activity datasets. These scripts employ a series
of rules for the detection of problem data that is corrected by a
combination of automated structure standardization including removing
salts, neutralizing unbalanced charges, merging duplicate structures
with finite activities, and identifying advanced problems resolved
by human recuration. Each model in Assay Central includes the following
metrics for evaluative predictive performance: recall, precision,
Specificity, F1-Score, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve,
Cohen’s Kappa (CK),76,77 and the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC).78 For the metric definitions
during 5-fold cross-validation, we will use the following abbreviations:
the number of true positives (TP), the number of false positives,
the number of true negatives (TN), and the number of false negatives.
Specificity or the TN rate is defined by the percentage of false class
labels correctly identified by 5-fold cross-validation (). Model recall also known as sensitivity,
or the true positive rate (TPR), is the percentage of positive class
labels (i.e., compound is active at a target) correctly identified
by the model out of the total number of actual positives and is defined: . Precision, also known as the positive
predictive value, is the percentage of positive class labels correctly
identified out of total predicted positives and is defined: . The F1-Score is simply the harmonic mean
of the recall and precision: .
The ROC curve can be computed by first
plotting the TPR versus the false positive rate (FPR) at various decision
thresholds, T, where . All constructed models are capable of
assigning a probability estimate of a sample belonging to the positive
class. The TPR and FPR performance are measured when we consider a
sample with a probability estimate >T as being
true
for various intervals between 0 and 1. The AUC can be calculated from
this plot and can be interpreted as the ability of the model to separate
classes, where 1 denotes perfect separation and 0.5 is random classification.
Accuracy is the percentage of correctly identified labels (TP and
TN) out of the entire population: . Cohen’s
Kappa (CK), attempts to
leverage the accuracy by normalizing it to the probability that the
classification would agree by chance (pe) and is calculated by , where , , . Another measure of overall model
classification
performance is the MCC,78 defined as ; MCC is not subject
to heavily imbalanced
classes, and its value can be between −1 and 1.

Assay
Central prediction workflows assign a probability-like score71,72 and applicability domain (which assesses the portion of fragments
overlapping with the training set molecules) to the input compounds
according to a user-specified model. Compounds presented in the training
set (including tautomers) were removed from the output. Predictions
were performed on compounds that were scored with the Assay Central
EBOV models. Compounds of interest, whether scoring as active or inactive,
were then selected for in vitro testing.

In Vitro Testing
Recombinant, infectious EBOV encoding
GFP was used for testing efficacy of compounds and was originally
provided by Dr Heinz Feldmann, Rocky Mountain Laboratories. The strain
that was used has the GFP gene inserted between the VP30 and VP24
genes. All viral infections were done in the BSL-4 lab at Texas Biomedical
Research Institute. Briefly, 4000 HeLa cells per well were grown overnight
in 384-well tissue culture plates, the volume of culture medium was
25 μL. On the day of assay, test compounds were diluted to 1
mM concentration in complete medium, mixed in equal volume to medium
overlaying the cells, and then serially diluted a total of 12 times
in triplicate. Treated cells were then incubated at 37 °C in
a humidified CO2 incubator for 1 h. Final concentrations
of 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81, 3.9, 1.9, 0.97, 0.48, 0.24,
and 0.12 μM were achieved upon addition of 25 μL of infection
mix containing Ebola-GFP virus, Bafilomycin at a final concentration
of 10 nM was used as a positive control drug. Infections were done
to achieve a MOI of 0.05–0.15. The virus-challenged cells were
incubated for 24 h. Post-infection for 24 h, cells were fixed and
inactivated by immersing the plates in formalin for 24 h at 4 °C.
Plates were washed 3× with PBS. EBOV-infected cells were stained
for nuclei using Hoechst at 1:50 000 dilution, and plates were
imaged. Nuclei (blue) and infected cells (green) were counted using
the CellProfiler software. Total number of nuclei (blue) was used
as a proxy for cell numbers, and a loss of cell number was assumed
to reflect cytotoxicity. Concentrations in which total cell numbers
were 20% less than the control were rejected from analysis.
