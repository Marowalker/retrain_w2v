The protein cross-reactive
material 197 (CRM197) is known to catalyze
the hydrolytic cleavage of DNA (DNase activity). A suspected metal-binding
site (S109, T111, and E112) and suspected DNA-binding motif (T89,
K90, and V91) were predicted within the CRM197 protein X-ray crystal
structure (4AE0) using METSITE and DNABindProt, respectively. Between
these two predicted sites is a groove (K103, E116, T120, E122, F123,
and R126) that may assist in DNase activity. Alanine scanning was
performed at these sites to determine which amino acids might be important
for DNase activity. These mutations individually or in combination
either maintained or increased the overall DNase activity compared
to the unmodified CRM197. Mutation at the suspected metal-binding
site showed similar fluctuations to the overall DNase activity whether
the DNase assays were run with Mg2+ and Ca2+ or Mn2+. However, many of the mutations within the suspected
DNA-binding motif saw significant differences depending on which metal
was used. Only some of the improvements in DNase activity could be
attributed to improved folding of the mutants compared to the unmodified
CRM197. This study should provide a basis for further mutagenesis
studies to remove the DNase activity of CRM197.

Introduction
Cross-reactive material
197 (CRM197) is a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria
toxin (DT) that is used as a carrier protein in several conjugate
vaccines currently available and within human clinical trials.1 DT targets the heparin-binding EGF-like receptor
(HB-EGF) on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) by using
its receptor-binding domain (R-domain) to trigger endocytosis.2 Once within the vesicle and the pH drops, the
transmembrane domain (T-domain) undergoes an allosteric conformational
change to allow the catalytic domain (C-domain) to be released into
the APC’s cytoplasm.3 The released
C-domain then uses its NAD+-diphthamide ADP-ribosyltransferase
(ADPRT) activity to inhibit eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2)
and impede protein translation.2 A single
mutation (G52E) within the catalytic domain of CRM197 prevents NAD+ binding and is responsible for the loss of the ADPRT cytotoxicity.4

CRM197 has gained in popularity for creating
conjugate vaccines
for infants because CRM197 utilizes an unmodified R-domain to actively
transport antigens into an APC.1 This active
transport of the antigen into the APC begins a T-cell-dependent immune
response, which is active in infants shortly after birth, thus offering
immunological protection earlier in an infant’s life.1

While the ADPRT activity of DT is well
known, Wisnieski and co-workers
demonstrated that DT also possesses deoxyribonuclease (DNase) activity.5,6 This DNase activity is located within the catalytic domain of the
DT, is distinct from the NAD binding site, and is not affected by
the G52E mutation found within CRM197.6 As such, CRM197 continues to possess this inherited DNase activity.
Wisnieski and co-workers were able to show that this DNase activity
can be cytotoxic to mammalian cells.6 The
DNase activity is unneeded for vaccine efficacy, so removing this
activity could improve the overall safety profile of CRM197-based
conjugate vaccines.

This initial study uses alanine scanning
within a predicted metal-binding
site and DNA-binding motif of the CRM197 structure.7 Alanine scanning can offer an estimate on the importance
of the individual amino acids to a protein’s folding efficiency
or catalytic activity.7 This technique
should offer additional clues as to the location of the DNase catalytic
site within CRM197.

Results and Discussion
The CRM197
is known to use either Mg2+ and Ca2+ or Mn2+ for DNase activity.6 This metal–cofactor
dependence suggests that identifying
a metal-binding site within the C-domain might provide a starting
point for mutagenesis studies. The CRM197 X-ray crystal structure
(4AE0)4 was submitted to the online metal-binding
site prediction server METSITE.8 METSITE
predicted three amino acids (S109, T111, and E112) that might function
as a metal-binding site. These residues are located within the C-domain
of the CRM197, as predicted by a previous study6 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 X-ray crystal structure of the C-domain of the CRM197.4 METSITE predicted a metal-binding domain at S109,
T111, and E112.8 DNABindProt predicted
a DNA-binding motif at Lys90.9 The G52E
mutation of CRM197 occurs within the NAD+-binding site
and significantly reduces the cytotoxic ADPRT activity that occurs
within the DT.

The amino acids forming
the predicted metal-binding site were mutated
individually (S109A, T111A, and E112Q) as well as in combination.
After expression in Escherichia coli and purification, the DNase activity of each mutant was measured
using an agarose gel-based DNase activity assay (Figure 2). For the Mg2+ and
Ca2+ reactions, the S109A and E112Q mutations significantly
increased the DNase activity compared to the unmodified CRM197, while
the T111A mutation showed little change (Figure 3). As additional mutations were included
within the CRM197, DNase activity started to revert back to levels
similar to that of the unmodified CRM197.

The CRM197 X-ray crystal structure
(4AE0)4 was also submitted to the online
DNA-binding motif prediction server
DNABindProt.9 DNABindProt predicted a DNA-binding
motif (T89, K90, and V91) within the CRM197 structure. A small groove
connects this predicted DNA-binding motif to the predicted metal-binding
site (Figure 1). This
groove may help facilitate the DNase activity within CRM197. Alanine
scanning was performed on several amino acids along this groove (K103A,
E116A, T120A, E122A, F123A, and R126A) (Figure 4). These mutations were prepared individually
as well as in combination. The assay results for the Mg2+ and Ca2+ reactions (Figure 3) showed that the individual mutants had
significantly increased DNase activity. The double and triple mutants
showed reduced DNase activities compared to the individual mutants
but were still generally higher than the unmodified CRM197. The E116A/E122A
mutant did display DNase activity similar to the unmodified CRM197.

crystal structure of the C-domain of the CRM197.4 The amino acid sites selected for mutagenesis
are indicated. Lys90 is located immediately behind Arg126.

The DNase activity of some of the CRM197 mutants
did appear to
change depending on which metal was used in the assay. The K103A,
E116A, F123A, E116A/R126A, and E116A/E122A/R126A mutants increased
their DNase activity with Mg2+ and Ca2+, while
the R126A and E116A/E122A mutants accelerated with Mn2+. The remaining mutations within the suspected DNA-binding motif
as well as all of the mutations within the suspected metal-binding
site appeared to react similarly to either metal.

Expression
of properly folded and active CRM197 within E. coli is difficult due to the presence of two disulfide
bonds.10−12 The CRM197 and mutants were purified from inclusion
bodies by lysing the cells in the presence of 6 M guanidine so as
to denature all of bacterial proteins, following a similar procedure
as described by Malito and co-workers.4 The samples were then allowed to refold during the affinity chromatography
purification step. The increased DNase activity of the mutants might
be caused by an improved folding efficiency during purification. To
test this hypothesis, freshly prepared CRM197 and mutant samples were
analyzed with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Figure 5). The overall trend of the
SEC data showed that improved folding of the mutant increased overall
DNase activity (Figure 6). However, several of the mutations did not follow this tendency.
Mutants S109A/T111A/E112Q, K103A/E122A, E116A/R126A, and F123A all
had similar percentages of folded protein compared to CRM197 but also
had increased DNase activity. In particular, CRM197 and the F123A
mutant both contained only ∼50% properly folded proteins. Yet,
the F123A contained some of the highest DNase activity observed in
this study.

determined by the integrations for folded and aggregated peaks within
size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

Figure 6 Fraction of CRM197 mutant sample that contained properly folded
protein as determined by SEC compared to overall DNase activity. A
low quantity of large DNA fragments remaining indicates higher overall
DNase activity.

This study sets out to
explore the DNase activity of CRM197 using
a combination of protein structural prediction and alanine scanning
to determine where the DNase active site might be located. The improvements
in folding and overall DNase activity of the mutants were unexpected
and cannot be easily explained at this time. However, this initial
screening data does provide a roadmap for full saturation mutagenesis
studies in the future. The goal of the overall project is to create
a CRM197 mutant that would eliminate its DNase activity. Making a
DNase-free CRM197 could allow for the creation of safer conjugate
vaccines in the future.

Materials and Methods
Expression and Purification
of Wild-Type and Mutant CRM197 Proteins
The CRM197 gene (UniProt
P00588) was synthesized by ATUM, Inc.
(Newark, CA) and cloned into the pET19b(+) expression plasmid (MilliporeSigma)
between the NdeI and BamHI restriction
sites using standard PCR and ligation techniques.13 The pET19b(+) plasmid adds an N-terminal 10×His purification
tag onto the expressed protein. Park and co-workers showed that the
presence of this purification tag did not disrupt CRM197 folding or
activity.11 The constructed plasmid was
transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells (Lucigen) and plated onto LB media
supplemented with ampicillin. A single colony was picked and cultured
overnight at 37 °C/200 rpm in 2 mL of LB media supplemented with
ampicillin. A 125 mL baffled flask containing 25 mL of Turbo broth
(AthenaES) was then inoculated with a 1% (v/v) seed from the overnight
culture. The flask was incubated at 37 °C/200 rpm until log phase,
which is typically 3 h. The flask was then cooled to 16 °C and
allowed to shake at 200 rpm for approximately 30 min. The cultures
were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) and allowed to incubate overnight at 16 °C/200 rpm. The
cells were then harvested with centrifugation (4000g, 10 min), and the medium was decanted. The cells were resuspended
in 10 mL of 6 M guanidine/50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8). The resuspended
cells were lysed with sonication for 1 min (typically 5 W). The cell
debris was pelleted by centrifugation (5000g, 15
min). The cell lysate was applied to 1 mL of HisLink purification
resin (Promega) and allowed to drip with gravity flow. The resin was
washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.6)/500
mM NaCl/10 mM imidazole). The protein was eluted from the resin with
three column volumes of elution buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.6)/500 mM
NaCl/500 mM imidazole). The purified protein was then dialyzed against
2 L of buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5)/100 mM NaCl) overnight at 4 °C
with stirring and two buffer changes. The purified protein was then
checked with SDS-PAGE. Each of the mutant CRM197 proteins was expressed
and purified as described above. Each mutant used a separate column
and purification resin so as to not cross-contaminate. A negative
control was also prepared using the above protocol, except the pET19b
plasmid did not contain the CRM197 gene. This negative control would
account for any contaminating native DNase enzymes that might be unexpectedly
copurified with the CRM197 proteins.

Mutagenesis
The
mutants were prepared using a QuikChange
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) following the standard protocol
(see Supporting Information). A K125A mutation
was prepared but this protein could not be expressed.

DNase Assay
The protein concentration for each protein
was assayed by mixing 100 μL of purified protein solution with
900 μL of 6 M urea and measuring A280 (ε = 54,500 Μ–1). For the DNase assay,
2.5 μg of protein was mixed with 2.5 μg of pUC19 plasmid
(EcoRI-linearized) in buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5)/2.5
mM MgSO4/2.5 mM CaCl2 or 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5)/2.5
mM MgSO4/5 mM MnCl2) and diluted to a final
volume of 20 μL. The reaction was incubated within a PCR machine
at 32 or 37 °C for 1 h (metal-binding site mutants) or 3 h (DNA-binding
site mutants). The samples were then run on a 1% agarose gel with
ethidium bromide staining. The image of the gel was analyzed with
ImageJ (version 1.51, NIH).14 For each
sample, the image intensity of DNA between 5 and 1.5 kb was divided
by the image intensity of the DNA between 5 kb and 100 bp. Each replication
set was normalized from its negative control sample. The reactions
were performed in triplicate for each temperature and metal.

Size Exclusion
Chromatography (SEC)
Freshly prepared
CRM197 and mutant samples were analyzed using a Bio SEC-5 column (300
mm × 4.6 mm; 150 Å; Agilent) fitted to an Agilent 1200 HPLC.
The mobile phase used 100 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2)/150
mM NaCl buffer, and each injection was run at 0.3 mL/min for 40 min.
A UV/Vis detector was used at 214 nm. Twenty microliters of each CRM197
and mutant sample or 10 μL of SEC protein standard (15–600
kDa; MilliporeSigma) was injected per run. The fraction of peak integration
for folded protein (∼55 kDa) compared to total CRM197 protein
(aggregated (∼260 kDa) and folded) was used to calculate the
overall folded fraction for each sample. Little to no CRM197 dimer
was observed in any of the samples, so it was not included in the
calculations. Each CRM197 or mutant sample was run in triplicate,
while the SEC protein standard was run six times.
