Pomace,
the press residue from different fruits accumulating as
waste product in food industry, contains high amounts of secondary
metabolites that could be utilized for health-related applications.
This study aims at evaluating the potential of pomaces of apricot,
bilberry, and elderberry to serve as a source for endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS)-activating compounds. Five extracts obtained
from the lyophilized pomace of apricot and elderberry with solvents
of different polarity were found to enhance A23187-stimulated eNOS
activity when tested at 50 μg/mL in an [14C]-l-arginine to [14C]-l-citrulline conversion
assay in the human endothelium-derived cell line EA.hy926 (p < 0.05). The bioassay-guided fractionation of the extracts
obtained with methanol/water (70:30) led to several active fractions
from apricot pomace (p < 0.05) and elderberry
pomace (p < 0.01). Liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry-based chemical analysis of the extracts and active fractions
pointed mainly to triterpenoic acids as active compounds. One particular
dihydroxytriterpenoic acid, characteristic for elderberry, was enriched
as the main compound in the two most active fractions and might serve
as a promising lead structure for further studies.

Introduction
Cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of deaths
worldwide, with ischemic heart disease and stroke together accounting
for estimated 15.2 million deaths in 2016.1 The number of deaths due to ischemic heart diseases has significantly
increased in the last two centuries, and the death rates are particularly
high in wealthy countries. Atherosclerosis has been evaluated as the
first manifestation of cardiovascular diseases. A root cause of atherosclerosis
is endothelial dysfunction, which is reversible by lifestyle changes,
but in most cases leads to more severe conditions. Nitric oxide (NO)
seems to play a key role in the maintenance of endothelial homeostasis
and vascular health.2,3 Vascular NO is mainly produced
by the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the endothelial
cell layer. It, inter alia, mediates relaxation in vascular smooth
muscle cells and influences their gene transcription/protein expression,
inhibits platelet aggregation, and serves as a vascular antioxidant.

Although there are numerous causes and risk factors for CVDs, it
is estimated that a high percentage is preventable by means of adaptations
to lifestyle, i.e., by avoiding established risk factors such as smoking,
excessive alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, and unhealthy
diet. A fruit- and vegetable-rich diet is associated with a reduced
risk for atherosclerosis,4 hypertension,5,6 and cardiovascular diseases7 and indeed
compounds from nutritional sources, such as quercetin,8 (−)-epicatechin,9 or
ursolic acid,10 have been shown to increase
the eNOS activity in vascular endothelial cells. Pomace, the press
residue from fruit juice, fruit nectar, or cider industry, still contains
high amounts of fruit-derived constituents,11,12 suggesting possible health-related applications. So far, some industrial
uses for pomaces are already in place, such as pectin extraction,
solid-phase fermentation, and animal feed. However, pomaces incur
in tons during the fruit press seasons and confront juice producers
with storage problems and disposal obligations; thus, further applications
are of high interest. This is already under investigation for apple
pomace,13,14 but should also be considered for other
pomaces.

In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize
extracts,
enriched fractions, or single compounds from apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.), bilberry (Vaccinium
myrtillus L.), and elderberry (Sambucus
nigra L.) pomace that are able to increase NO production
in human endothelium-derived cells. To this end, we tested whether
extracts obtained with solvents of different polarity enhance A23187-stimulated
eNOS activation in EA.hy926 cells using the [14C]-l-arginine to [14C]-l-citrulline conversion assay
(ACCA), in which [14C]-l-citrulline production
serves as a surrogate marker of liberated NO. The chemical characterization
of the extracts by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
(LC–MS) identified several flavonoids, fatty acids, and triterpenoic
acids that were previously shown to mediate beneficial effects on
eNOS activation in vivo and/or in vitro. Bioassay-guided fractionation
led to the conclusion that several di- and trihydroxylated triterpenoic
acids are most likely responsible for the increase in A23187-stimulated
eNOS activity observed for several fractions and extracts.

Results
and Discussion
Pomace Extraction
Solvents of different
polarity, namely,
methanol/water (70:30) (MeW), ethylacetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane
(DCM), and hexane (HEX), were used for extraction. Drug/extract ratios
(DERs) are listed in Table 1. The MeW extraction resulted in the highest yields for all
pomace samples, showing that polar constituents such as carbohydrates
make up the largest part of all pomaces. This is particularly the
case for apricot pomace, whose extractable matter is predominately
composed of polar compounds, whereas the berry pomaces also contain
significant amounts of substances that are preferentially extracted
with DCM or HEX.

Potential of Pomace Extracts to Enhance eNOS Activation
Twelve extracts from three different fruit pomaces (Table 1) were screened for their ability
to enhance A23187-stimulated activation of eNOS in the immortalized
human endothelium-derived cell line EA.hy926. For this, the [14C]-l-arginine to [14C]-l-citrulline
conversion assay (ACCA) with ascorbic acid (100 μM) as positive
control (PC) and solvent vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) as negative
control (NC) was applied. The assay was performed 24 h after cell
treatment to allow the detection of influences on eNOS activity on
the transcriptional, translational, or post-translational level.15,16

When tested at a concentration of 50 μg/mL, two apolar
extracts (EtOAc, DCM) of apricot pomace significantly increased the
eNOS activity compared to the negative control (p value 0.05, Figure 1A). None of the bilberry pomace extracts showed any effect on eNOS
activity in EA.hy926 cells (Figure 1B), whereas three of four elderberry pomace extracts
exhibited a significant increase (p value 0.05, Figure 1C). With a 1.5-fold
increase over the negative control, the elderberry pomace MeW extract
showed a higher effect than the DCM and HEX extracts. Cell viability
was controlled by the WST-1 assay. The metabolic activity of EA.hy926
cells was impaired by the elderberry HEX extract (p value 0.01), but not by the MeW and DCM extracts (Figure 2). Consequently, the elderberry
pomace was considered as the best source for compounds able to enhance
eNOS activation.

Figure 1 A23187-stimulated eNOS activity in EA.hy926 cells measured
by the
arginine–citrulline conversion assay (ACCA) after 24 h of treatment

(A), bilberry pomace (B), and elderberry pomace (C). NC, negative

and one-tailed Mann–Whitney test (n = 3; mean

Identification of the Main Compounds in Pomace Extracts by HPLC–DAD–CAD
and HPLC–ESI–MS Analysis
The obtained extracts
were chemically characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC)–diode array detector (DAD)–charged aerosol detector
(CAD) and HPLC–electrospray ionization (ESI)–MS analyses,
and the results are presented in Table 2. All MeW extracts consisted mainly of polar compounds
that were not or only weakly retained on the C18 column material (Figure 3), of which only
citric acid (1) was identified by comparison with a reference
(Figure S4). Several flavonoids and anthocyanins
were elucidated in the berry pomace MeW extracts as less polar constituents.
The most abundant ones were cyanidin-3-glucoside (7),
cyanidin-3-sambubioside (2),17 and rutin (17)18 (Figure S5) from elderberry and hyperoside (19)19 (Figure S6), as well as numerous glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin,
petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin (3–16)20 from bilberry.

structure according to
literature references.

Triterpenoic
acids and fatty acids were already detected in the
MeW extracts (Figure 3) but became the dominant compound classes in all apolar EtOAc, DCM,
and HEX extracts (Figure S1).

In
all three pomaces, oleanolic acid (42) and ursolic
acid (43) were the main triterpenoic acids (Figure S7). Apricot pomace displayed the highest
diversity of triterpenoic acid species, with numerous trihydroxy-
(21, 22), dihydroxy- (27, 31, 34, and 35), and coumaroyldihydroxytriterpenoic
acids (28, 32) along with betulinic acid
(41) and an acetoxytriterpenoic acid (46) being present particularly in the EtOAc and DCM extract (Figure S1). Another dihydroxytriterpenoic acid
(26) was specific for elderberry, whereas both elderberry
and bilberry contained relatively low amounts of two oxohydroxytriterpenoic
acids (33, 36) and a compound tentatively
identified as oleanadienoic or ursadienoic acid (45).

Regarding fatty acids, linoleic acid (47) was abundant
in the elderberry and bilberry MeW extracts (Figure 3), whereas palmitic acid (48) (Figure S7), oleic acid (49), and stearic acid (53) were found in different concentrations
in all apolar extracts (Figure S1).

Particularly in case of the HEX extracts, which generally showed
the lowest peak numbers of all extracts, it is likely that additional
compounds are present that are too apolar to be detected by the applied
LC–MS method.

Bioactivity-Guided Fractionation of the Pomace
MeW Extracts
To identify the active components that increase
eNOS activity,
the methanol/water extracts were chosen for bioassay-guided fractionation
for the following reasons: (a) the elderberry MeW extract was an effective
enhancer of eNOS activity, (b) extractable polar bulk compounds, such
as carbohydrates and organic acids, may mask bioactivities of lower
concentrated compounds in the other MeW extracts, (c) MeW yielded
the highest amounts of extract for all investigated pomaces, (d) methanol
comprises comparable dissolving properties to ethanol, a solvent that
obliges minor restrictions in food and pharmaceutical industry, and
(e) the MeW extracts contained the highest variety of compounds, ranging
from very polar to apolar, with most of the compounds detected in
the apolar extracts (EtOAc, DCM, HEX) being also present in the MeW
extract, just less abundant.

The fractionation of the MeW extracts
from apricot, bilberry, and elderberry pomace by column chromatography
on styrene–divinylbenzene resulted in 24, 36, and 30 cumulative
fractions, which were screened (n = 1) for their
potential to increase eNOS activity (Figure S2). Fractions that showed positive effects in the initial ACCA screening
were retested twice to reaffirm their bioactivity (Figure 4).

Figure 4 A23187-stimulated eNOS
activity in EA.hy926 cells measured by the
arginine–citrulline conversion assay (ACCA) after 24 h of treatment
(10 μg/mL) with cumulative fractions obtained from the fractionation
of apricot pomace MeW extract (A), bilberry pomace MeW extract (B),
and elderberry pomace MeW extract (C). The data from the screening
of all fractions are shown in Figure S2. NC, negative control (DMSO); PC, positive control (100 μM
ascorbic acid); one-tailed Mann–Whitney test (n = 3; mean ± SD; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

The fractions obtained from the bilberry MeW extract showed
no
significant effect on eNOS (Figure 4B) and were thus not further investigated. Fractionation
of the apricot pomace MeW extract yielded fractions able to moderately
enhance eNOS activation (Figure 4A). Phytochemical analysis revealed that one of them
(fraction 193–202) was enriched in triterpenoic acids (21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 41, 42, and 43), particularly the more polar ones already detected in
the active EtOAc and DCM extracts (Figure S3). The other, more apolar two fractions (fraction 203–218,
fraction 219–238) were less complex (Figure S3). One major compound in both fractions was an unknown acetoxytriterpenoic
acid (46). Furthermore, an acetoxyhydroxytriterpenoic
acid (38) and two fatty acids were identified in fraction
203–218, whereas fraction 219–238 contained an oxidized
lipid (44)—besides some unidentified compounds,
which were present in both fractions.

From elderberry pomace
MeW extract, a significant increase in eNOS
activity was affirmed for seven cumulative fractions (Figure 4C), of which, three most active
ones were analyzed in detail (Figure 5). The LC–MS analyses of fractions 211–215
and 216–221 revealed that the most abundant constituent of
both is a dihydroxytriterpenoic acid (26), probably 20β-hydroxyursolic
acid according to literature,21,22 accompanied by an unknown
compound (51). The third active fraction from elderberry
pomace (242–255) showed only peaks of very low intensity, such
as those of ursolic and oleanolic acid (42, 43), and probably contains compounds that escape detection by the applied
LC–MS method.

Although the main compounds in these active fractions were
elucidated
as triterpenoic acids, which are generally known for apoptotic or
cytotoxic effects,23 the metabolic activity
of EA.hy926 cells was actually increased by these fractions (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Metabolic activity of
EA.hy926 cells measured by the WST-1 assay
after 24 h of treatment (10 μg/mL) with eNOS-activating fractions
from elderberry pomace MeW extract. NC, negative control (DMSO); PC,
positive control (100 μM ursolic acid); and one-tailed Mann–Whitney
test (n = 3; mean ± SD; *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

Because only fatty acids and triterpenoic
acids were identified
as major compounds in the active MeW fractions and apolar extracts,
their potential to mediate beneficial effects on eNOS activity is
discussed.

Considering the identified fatty acids, an increase
in basal eNOS
activity in EA.hy926 cells was reported upon treatment with palmitic
acid (48),24 whereas Couloubaly
et al.24 reported a decrease in basal eNOS
activity and eNOS-serine 1177 phosphorylation in EA.hy926 cells after
stimulation with 100 μM linoleic acid (47)–albumin
complex for 24 h. A contribution of fatty acids to the activity of
some fractions and extracts can thus not be excluded.

Triterpenoic
acids, which made up the largest fraction of the extractable
apolar compounds, comprise various biological activities.23 Focusing on eNOS activation, ursolic acid, for
instance, was shown to mediate the acute NO-dependent vasorelaxant
effects of Lepechinia caulescens (Ortega)
Epling25 and the cardiovascular protective
effects of the Chinese drug Danshen (i.e., Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge).10 Increased eNOS promotor activity,
eNOS mRNA and protein expression, and an increased phosphorylation
at eNOS serine 1177 were shown to contribute to the enhanced NO production
mediated by ursolic acid.10,26 Rios et al.27 predicted the affinities of plant-derived triterpenoic
acids to two binding pockets of eNOS by computational docking experiments.

However, triterpenoic acids are also known for their inhibition
of cell proliferation and their cytotoxicity. He and Liu28 reported half maximum effective concentrations
(EC50) for cytotoxicity of nine triterpenoic acids from
apple peel in different cancer cell lines between 18.2 and 332 μM.
Yamaguchi et al.29 showed that 20 μM
ursolic acid inhibited the growth of tumorigenic HM-SFME-1 cells to
10% and of nontumorigenic SFME-1 cells to 40% relative to the control.
Further, it has been shown that ursolic acid concentrations above
5 μM significantly reduce the cell viability of coronary artery
endothelial cells.26

hinted toward a higher eNOS-activating potential of fractions rich
in di- and trihydroxylated triterpenoic acids compared to that containing
predominantly oleanolic and ursolic acid. This result confirms the
previous data obtained for apple pomace.16 The activity of fractions obtained previously from apple pomace
and now from apricot pomace MeW extract seems to be mediated by a
mixture of several triterpenoic acids that are not necessarily active
as single substance. In contrast, the two most active fractions from
elderberry pomace MeW extract were of low complexity. The same main
compound—a dihydroxytriterpenoic acid (26) that
is probably 20β-hydroxyursolic acid—was detected in both
fractions. These fractions clearly did not reduce the cell metabolic
activity. The isolation, structure elucidation, and investigation
of the mechanism of action of this compound would certainly be of
interest but was not achieved in this study due to the low amounts
of the relevant fractions.

As outlined above, several abundant
compounds of the investigated
fruit pomace extracts can be associated with beneficial effects on
the activity of eNOS based on in vivo and/or in vitro studies. The
eNOS in the endothelial cell layer is mainly responsible for the release
of vascular NO, which protects the cardiovascular system in several
ways: it regulates the vascular tone via relaxation of the vascular
smooth muscle cells, has antithrombotic effects, serves as a vascular
antioxidant, and attenuates the adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular
endothelium. Although it is well established and broadly communicated
that a fruit- and vegetable-rich diet is associated with a reduced
risk for cardiovascular diseases,4−7 changing their lifestyle proves to be very
difficult to many people. Food supplements that are highly enriched
in fruit-derived compounds that enhance eNOS in vivo could be one
option in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Our results indicate
that fruit pomaces might serve as a useful resource for the production
of such food supplements, but further studies, particularly in vivo
data, are required on the way to develop such a product.

Conclusions
In this study, constituents extracted from apricot, bilberry, and
elderberry pomaces were analyzed by LC–MS and evaluated on
their potential to beneficially influence the activity of eNOS. The
majority of the extractable matter is made up of very polar compounds,
but only the elderberry methanol/water (70:30) (MeW) extracts enhanced
A23187-stimulated eNOS activity in the human endothelium-derived cell
line EA.hy926 at 50 μg/mL. In addition, four of the more apolar
extracts from the apricot and elderberry pomaces were active in the
ACCA. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the apricot and elderberry
pomace MeW extracts indicates that di- and trihydroxylated triterpenoic
acids contribute strongly to the observed activity, whereas the major
constituents oleanolic and ursolic acid are less or not effective.
One particular dihydroxytriterpenoic acid from elderberry pomace,
probably 20β-hydroxyursolic acid, might serve as a promising
lead structure for further studies. It was highly enriched in fractions
that enhanced A23187-stimulated eNOS activity at 10 μg/mL, but
that did not reduce the cell metabolic activity, although triterpenoic
acids are generally associated with cytotoxic effects. Provided that
our in vitro data can be translated to positive effects in vivo, apricot
and particularly elderberry pomaces might become valuable resources
for health-related applications, such as the production of food supplements
that reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases.

Methods

Methanol (MeOH) and hexane (HEX), both AnalaR
Normapur, dichloromethane (DCM) and ethyl acetate (EtOAc), both GPR
Rectapur, and acetonitrile (ACN) HiPerSolv Chromanorm for HPLC–CAD–MS
analysis were obtained from VWR (Vienna, Austria). Formic acid (purity
>98.0%) and conc. ammonia (24%) were purchased from Gatt-Koller
(Absam,
Austria). Water, for extraction and phytochemical analysis, was deionized
and distilled. Betulinic acid (purity 95%), corosolic acid (purity
90%), maslinic acid (purity 89%), oleanolic acid (purity 94%) and
ursolic acid (purity 94%), cyanidin-3-O-sambubioside
(purity 99%), cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (purity 88%),
delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (purity 87%), malvidin-3-O-glucoside (purity 99%), peonidin-3-O-glucoside
(purity 94%), and petunidin-3-O-glucoside (purity
99%) were provided from Phytolab (Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany), hyperoside
(purity 99%), and rutin (purity 99%) from Extrasynthèse (Lyon,
France), and palmitic acid (purity 99%) and linoleic acid (purity
99%) from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Sample Collection and Preparation
Stone-free apricot
pomace, from Obsthof Reisinger (Spitz/Donau, Austria), as well as
elderberry pomace and bilberry pomace, both from RAUCH Fruchtsäfte
(Rankweil, Austria), was immediately frozen (−20 °C) after
pressing in the season 2011 and lyophilized for 48 h (Zirbus Va Co
5–11) before further processing. The apricot pomace was crushed
using pistil and mortar, bilberry pomace was milled (RETSCH mill,
sieve 0.5), and elderberry pomace was excluded from comminution treatment
to avoid the release of cyanogenic glycosides due to the high stone
content.30 Addition of 20% diatomaceous
earth to the homogeneous pomace powders avoided clotting during the
pressurized liquid extraction process.

Extraction
Pressurized
liquid extraction of homogenized
pomace samples was carried out using an ASE 200 accelerated solvent
extraction system (Dionex, Vienna, Austria) with methanol/water (70:30)
(MeW), ethylacetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane (DCM), and hexane (HEX)
as solvents. For each solvent, 8–10 g pomace or pomace/diatomaceous
earth-mixture was filled into an 11 mL extraction cell and extracted
in three cycles using the following conditions: preheat time: 5 min;
heat time: 5 min; temperature: 40 °C; static extraction: 5 min;
flush volume: 0.6%, purge time: 60 s; pressure: 1500 psi. The obtained
extracts were dried by solvent evaporation and subsequent lyophilization,
if necessary.

Fractionation of the MeW Extracts
Pomaces were extracted
with MeW under conditions stated above but using 22 mL extraction
cells filled with 15–17 g pomace or pomace/diatomaceous earth-mixture.
The obtained pomace MeW extracts were dissolved in EtOH 96% (v/v)/water
(50:50) and ultracentrifuged. The supernatant was pipetted in portions
onto a styrene–divinylbenzene matrix (DIAION-HP 20), which
previously has been washed with EtOH 96% (v/v) and conditioned with
EtOH 96% (v/v)/H2O (10:90).

Fractions of 200 mL were
eluted with a series of EtOH 96% (v/v)/H2O mixtures of
decreasing polarity, in the case of elderberry and bilberry pomace,
followed by MeOH and EtOAc. The fractions showing similar thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) fingerprints were combined to cumulative fractions.
Detailed information is given in Chapter 3 (Supporting Information).

[14C]-l-Arginine to [14C]-l-Citrulline Conversion Assay
The [14C]-l-arginine to [14C]-l-citrulline
conversion
assay (ACCA) was performed as described previously.15,16 In brief, 5 × 105 EA.hy926 cells/well were seeded
in 6-well plates and cultivated to confluence for 3–4 days.
Before stimulation, 100 U/mL of bovine liver catalase (Sigma-Aldrich)
was added to the culture media. Catalase prevents the accumulation
of H2O2, which originates from reactions of
the phenolic plant compounds with cell culture media components and
may lead to false-positive results. For the assay, stock solutions
of the extracts or fractions in DMSO were freshly diluted into the
culture medium. Final DMSO concentrations did not exceed 0.1%. Negative
control cells were treated with identical volumes of pure DMSO. Twenty-four
hours after stimulation with either DMSO, as a negative control, or
the indicated concentrations of the respective extracts and fractions,
the medium was removed. The cells were washed and equilibrated for
15 min with 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl sulfonic acid
(HEPES) buffer (10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl sulfonic
acid (HEPES), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl from Carl Roth, 2 mM MgSO4, 10 mM glucose, 1.5 mM CaCl2·2H2O from Sigma-Aldrich, pH 7.4). Subsequently, 0.32 μM [14C]-l-arginine (346 mCi/mmol, New England Nuclear,
Boston, MA) and 1 μM calcium ionophore (A23187, Alexis Biochemicals,
Paisly, U.K.) were added. After 15 min of [14C]-l-citrulline production, the reaction was stopped by washing the cells
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were lysed
with ice-cold ethanol 96% (v/v) and subsequently extracted with water.
The supernatant was dried under vacuum (SPD 1010 Speed Vac, Thermo
Savant). The obtained cell extract was redissolved in MeOH/H2O (1/1) and separation of [14C]-l-arginine and
[14C]-l-citrulline was conducted via TLC (Polygram
SIL N-HR, 20 × 20 cm, Machery-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using
methanol/ammonia conc./chloroform/water (9:4:1:2) as mobile phase.
Dried plates were autoradiographed by a phosphoimager (BAS-1800II,
Fujifilm, Germany) and AIDA software (raytest, Langenzersdorf, Austria)
was used for densitometric analysis. l-Ascorbic acid (100
μM, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as positive control.

Evaluation
of Cell Viability
Viable, metabolically
active cells convert the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-[3-(4-Iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitro-phenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate) to a water-soluble
formazan derivative with high absorption rates at 440 nm. WST-1 was
used according to the protocol given by the supplier (Roche Diagnostics,
IN). The evaluation was performed 24 h after stimulation with the
indicated concentrations of the respective extracts or fractions with
correction for the self-absorption of the samples. Ursolic acid was
used as a positive control.

Statistical Analysis
Raw data from
the ACCA and WST-1
assay were normalized to the negative control (NC). Normalized data
were incorporated in GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (La Jolla, CA). Significant
differences with the NC were calculated using one-tailed Mann–Whitney
Test. Shown are the mean values ± SD of three independent experiments.

Phytochemical Analysis
Sample Preparation
MeW extracts
were dissolved in MeW
to a concentration of 5.0 mg/mL, EtOAc, DCM, and HEX pomace extracts
in MeOH/DMSO (80:20) in a concentration of 8.0 mg/mL. The samples
were sonicated for 10 min, centrifuged at 13.4 × 103 rpm, and the supernatant taken for analysis. The precipitate was
dried using a centrifugal evaporator (Genevac, Ipswich, U.K.) and
weighed for calculating the percentage of dissolved extract, representing
the phytochemically characterized part of the extract (Table S1).

Fractions were dissolved in
MeOH/DMSO (80:20) at concentrations of 8 mg/mL.

HPLC–DAD–CAD
and HPLC–MS Analysis
Analyses were carried out on
an UltiMate 3000 RSLC-series system
(Dionex/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germering, Germany) coupled in parallel
to a Corona ultra RS charged aerosol detector (CAD, Dionex/Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and an HCT 3D quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer
equipped with an orthogonal ESI source (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany). The separation was performed on an Agilent Hypersil BDS
C18, 4.0 × 250 mm, 5
μm column using water with pH 2.8 (formic acid) as mobile phase
A and acetonitrile, modified with the same amount of formic acid,
as mobile phase B. The HPLC flow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Gradient program
1 (GP1), used for MeW extracts, consisted of a linear increase from
1% B to 95% B in 60 min at 17 °C column oven temperature. Gradient
program 2 (GP2), conducted for EtOAc, DCM, and HEX extracts, started
with a concentration of 35% mobile phase B, which increased by 1%
per min at 25 °C column oven temperature. The final mobile phase
B concentration in both methods was 95%, which was held for 10 min
to wash the column between the single runs, followed by 10 min of
equilibration at starting conditions of the respective gradient program.
As the primary objective was the phytochemical comparison of the different
pomace extracts and fractions, the HPLC methods were not further optimized
for particular pomace extracts or fractions.

After passing the
DAD, the eluate flow was split 4:1 between the CAD and the MS, respectively.
The CAD nebulizer temperature was 35 °C and the ESI ion source
was operated as follows: capillary voltage: +3.5/–3.7 kV, nebulizer:
26 psi (N2), dry gas flow: 9 L/min (N2), and
dry temperature: 340 °C. Positive and negative ions mode multistage
mass spectra up to MS4 were obtained in automated data-dependent
acquisition (DDA) mode using helium as collision gas, an isolation
window of Δm/z = 4, and a
fragmentation amplitude of 1.0 V.
