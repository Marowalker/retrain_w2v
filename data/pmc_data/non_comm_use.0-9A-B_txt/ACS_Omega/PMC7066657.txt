Nowadays, rationally preparing heterostructure
materials can not
only make up for the shortage of individual components, but also exert
unexpected performance through synergistic interactions between the
components. Herein, a core–shell of WS2@NiCo2O4 screw-like heterostructure arrays grown on carbon
cloth (CC) was prepared by a two-step solvothermal method for supercapacitors.
As a binder-free flexible electrode, a high areal capacitance of 2449.9
mF cm–2 can be achieved for WS2@NiCo2O4/CC at a current density of 1 mA cm–2. Benefiting from the core–shell of the WS2@NiCo2O4 heterostructure, the capacitive property of
the flexible WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode
is better than those of WS2/CC and NiCo2O4/CC electrodes. Based on WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes, the assembled flexible solid-state symmetric
supercapacitor (FSS) device shows a high energy density of ∼45.67
W h kg–1 at a power density of 992.83 W kg–1. Meantime, the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC-assembled
FSS device also exhibits high cycling stability with an excellent
capacity retention of ∼85.59% after 5000 cycles.

1 Introduction
As
energy crises and environmental friendliness are the most important
issues in modern society, in the past decade enormous research effort
has been devoted to developing advanced energy storage devices such
as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs). Compared
to LIBs, SCs have a high power output, faster charge–discharge
rate, and long cycle life so that it can be designed for wearable
electronic devices (such as smart wristbands and portable devices)
and other vital applications.1,2 Hereof, the emergence
of the flexible all-solid-state SC has aroused widespread interest
among researchers. As the key to the flexible solid-state symmetric
SCs (SSCs), electrode materials need to have not only good mechanical
properties but, more importantly, have also excellent long cycle,
power density, and energy density.3 However,
conventional carbon-based materials cannot meet the demand of high-performance
energy storage because of its intrinsic electric double-layer capacitor
(EDLC) mechanism (usually 70–250 F g–1, depending
on the electrolyte used).4 Therefore, combining
carbon-based materials with pseudocapacitor materials is considered
as one of the most effective ways for improving capacitor performance.5

As a kind of pseudocapacitor materials,
nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has been an extraordinary
class of energy storage
material for electrochemical SCs owing to its many advantages such
as low cost, abundant resources, and environmental friendliness as
well as its good electrochemical performance.6−8 As is well known,
the redox reactions provided by NiCo2O4, including
contributions from both the nickel and cobalt ions, are richer than
those of the monometallic nickel oxides and cobalt oxides.9 Significant advances in this field have been
achieved using several different types of NiCo2O4 nanostructures, including nanoparticles,10 nanoplatelets,11,12 nanosheets,13 nanowires,14 nanotubes,15 microspheres,16 and
the formation of composites with carbon nanofibers17 and graphene.18,19 For example, Wang et
al.20 designed a NiCo2O4/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite based on electrostatic
interactions. The initial specific capacitance of NiCo2O4/RGO composite can achieve 835 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1 which is much
higher than those of pure NiCo2O4 and RGO. Combining
carbon nanotubes with NiCo2O4, Abouali et al.21 prepared the NiCo2O4/CNT
nanocomposites through a low-temperature, one-pot hydrothermal method.
They reported a high Li-storage capacity of 1020 mA h g–1 at 300 mA g–1 after 100 cycles while pseudocapacitive
performance of the electrode was equal with a capacitance of 680 F
g–1 when discharged at 1 A g–1. Obviously, the combination of NiCo2O4 with
electronically conducting carbon-based materials can significantly
enhance the charge transport and lead to the improvement of capacitor
performance.

For meeting the demand of SSCs, the molding and
film formation
performances of electrode materials are very vital. Generally, self-assembly,
template-assembly, and supporting methods are widely used for fabrication
of electrode materials for SSCs. Ni foam and carbon cloth (CC) are
more convenient and effective materials as a substrate for flexible
electrodes.22,23 As a binder-free electrode for
Li-ion batteries, the NiCo2O4/carbon composite
textiles exhibited a high specific capacity of ∼1012 mA h g–1 at a current density of 0.5 A g–1, retaining 854 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles. An excellent
specific capacitance of 1010 F g–1 (79% of the capacitance
at 1 A g–1) at a current density of 20 A g–1 and remarkable cycling stability (without negligible specific capacitance
lose after 5000 cycles) can be achieved as an electrochemical capacitor
electrode.24

Although many signs
of progression on NiCo2O4-based SC have been
observed, the poor intrinsic conductivity and
large volume change still limit the further applications of NiCo2O4 in high-performance SC. For the NiCo2O4/CC electrode material, a single NiCo2O4 loading typically exhibits limited kinetics in the redox
reaction on the CC because they have a lower surface area and the
short ion pathways, resulting in reduced electrochemical storage properties
of SCs.24 In addition, NiCo2O4-based electrodes suffer from low ion diffusion rate
because of the Faradaic nature with limited diffusion length at the
electrode/electrolyte interface, which make them show an unsatisfied
rate capability and capacitance. The potential window of NiCo2O4 is still relatively low usually −0.1
to 0.6 V versus SCE or Ag/AgCl.25−27 Therefore, the potential window
needs to be extended and fits for the real application.

Recently,
the development of interface/surface engineering provides
an effective way to solve the mentioned problems. Rational designing
of the core–shell heterostructures can be used as an ideal
unit to enhance the electrochemical energy storage properties, caused
by the active surface area and short ion pathway and more efficient
ion-accessibility between the interface of the electrolyte and electrode.28,29 He et al.23 prepared hierarchical FeCo2O4@NiCo-LDH core–shell heterostructures
on CC. The FeCo2O4@NiCo-LDH/CC electrode exhibits
a remarkable specific capacitance of 2426 F g–1 at
1 A g–1 and ultrahigh rate capability (72.5% of
the capacitance retention at 20 A g–1), as well
as excellent cycling stability. They attributed the improved electrochemical
behavior to judiciously engineer the interface with unique hierarchical
core–shell heterostructures. The ZnCo2O4@MnO2 core–shell structure using a simple hydrothermal
method was reported by Ma et al.30 The
hybrid ZnCo2O4@MnO2 electrode delivered
a specific capacitance of 2380 mF cm–2 at a high
current density of 5 A g–1 and has a good long-term
cycling stability because of the synergistic effect between ZnCo2O4 and MnO2.

Tungsten disulfide
(WS2), a kind of two-dimensional
transition-metal dichalcogenides, has been considered as promising
capacitive materials because of its unique chemical and physical properties.28−30 It exhibits electrochemical charge storage behavior via both EDLC
and pseudocapacitance reactions. Its unique layered structure and
high capacitance especially makes WS2 easy to combine ions
and enhancing ion adsorption and transportation.31−34 Liu et al.35 synthesized the WS2/CC composite as a negative
electrode for flexible asymmetric SCs. They reported that the crystallinity
of WS2 nanosheets boosted the durability and area capacitance
of WS2 nanosheets (0.93 F cm–2 at 4 mA
cm–2), thereby improving their cycle stability and
capacitance retention of thes electrode (82% after 10,000 cycles).
Shang et al.31 fabricated interwoven WS2 nanoplates on CC (WS2/CC) by a facile solvothermal
method.32 The resulting electrodes achieved
a high specific capacitance of 399 F g–1 at 1.0
A g–1 and ultra-high cycling stability with 99%
retention of capacitance after 500 cycles, which can be attributed
to the close combination between WS2 and CC.

In this
work, we successfully fabricated a core–shell heterostructure
of WS2@NiCo2O4 on CC (WS2@NiCo2O4/CC) by a simple two-step solvothermal
method. The large number of active sites and proper strain regulation
of the WS2@NiCo2O4 heterostructure
boosted both the ion acceleration and the electron transfer, thereby
improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode and also
solving the problem of poor conductivity of WS2. The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes show a high area
capacitance of 2449.9 mF cm–2 at a current density
of 1 mA cm–2. The SSCs assembled with the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode has a high energy
density of 45.67 W h kg–1 at 992.83 W kg–1. The device also exhibited significant cycle stability even after
5000 cycles at a large current density of 2 mA cm–2, maintaining an initial capacitance of 85.59% while still having
excellent reliability. The achieved results revealed the importance
of the effects of hybrid design and the involved synergetic effect
between the components of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC composite electrode on electrochemical performance of
symmetric SCs.

2 Results and Discussion
WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes were
prepared by a two-step solvothermal method (Figure 1a). In the first step of the solvothermal
reaction, the needle-like NiCo2O4 arrays were
deposited on the surfaces of the CC substrate (Figure 1b). It is clearly revealed in Figures 1b and S1 that the NiCo2O4 needle array was
formed and arranged on the surface of carbon fibers of CC. From the
inset of Figure 1b,
the height and width of NiCo2O4 needles are
found to be about 1.5 μm and 100 nm, respectively. In the second
step of the solvothermal reaction, the WS2 nanoplates were
further grown on the surface of the as-prepared NiCo2O4/CC hybrid (Figure 1c,d). The CC were uniformly covered by NiCo2O4@WS2 core–shell structures (Figure 1c). Obviously, the surface
of NiCo2O4 became very rough with screw-like
threads, which may offer growing WS2 nanoplates on NiCo2O4 needles (Figure 1c). As can be seen in Figure 1d, the WS2@NiCo2O4 structures exhibited a screw-like morphology and the heads
of NiCo2O4 needles were linked together. We
successfully prepared the core–shell WS2@NiCo2O4 screw-like arrays which chemically bonded to
the conductive CC substrate via a two-step solvothermal approach.
In fact, there are lots of space between adjacent NiCo2O4 needles which provide enough growth spaces for WS2 (Figure 1b).

WS2@NiCo2O4/CC, (b) SEM image of
the NiCo2O4 needle-like arrays on CC, and (c,d)
low- and high- magnification SEM images of core–shell of WS2@NiCo2O4 screw-like heterostructure
arrays grown on CC.

Figure 2 shows the
WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrodes
obtained from different solvothermal reaction times. The surface of
CC became more and more dense by changing the reaction time of the
solvothermal synthesis at 200 °C for 4, 8, 12, and 16 h. As clearly
observed in Figure 2e,f, there is no needle-like morphology which is almost totally coated
by layered WS2 at the end of 16 h. It means that the increase
in growing density of WS2 on the surface of NiCo2O4 needles lacks its stability specifically after the
reaction time of 12 h. It does not mean that a high capacitive performance
for the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrodes
can be obtained with higher WS2 loading in practical SSCs.
This was proved by the results of capacitive performance tests which
will be further discussed in the following sections.

reaction with different times: (a,b) 4, (c,d) 8, and (e,f) 16 h.

The detail screw-like core–shell heterostructures
arrays
of WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrids on the surfaces
of the CC substrate was further investigated by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). The sheet-like structures observed in the edge of
WS2@NiCo2O4 structures (Figure 3a) revealed that
the needle-like NiCo2O4 arrays were surrounded
by WS2 nanosheets with a thickness of several nanometers.
As shown in the energy-dispersive system (EDS) elemental mapping images
(Figure 3b), the Ni,
Co, W, O, and S elements are uniformly distributed on the surfaces
of WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrid structures,
confirming the successful combination of WS2 with NiCo2O4 and their core–shell hierarchical structure.
The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images provide the direct information
of the core–shell heterostructure of WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrids on the surfaces of the CC substrate
(Figure 3c). The various
crystal faces with polycrystalline properties exist, and there is
an observable grain boundary between the NiCo2O4 (zone I) and WS2 (zone II) in the structure of WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrids. The interplanar spacing
of 0.469 nm in zone I is indexed to the (111) lattice plane of the
cubic NiCo2O4 phase. In zone II, the interplanar
crystal spacing of 0.267 and 0.273 nm were ascribed to the (101) and
(100) planes of the WS2 phase, respectively. It means that
the core–shell heterostructure of the WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrid was successfully formed on the surfaces
of the CC substrate. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were also recorded
to examine the composition and phase evolution of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid structure (Figure 3d). The diffraction peaks are
substantially identical to the characteristic peaks identified for
the standard cubic NiCo2O4 and 2H-WS2. Two diffraction peaks observed around 2θ of 26 and 42°
are attributed to the peaks of (002) and (100) planes of carbon fibers.
The peaks detected at around 31.2, 36.7, 59.1, and 65.1° in pattern
are corresponding to the (220), (311), (440), and (511) planes, respectively,
which can be assigned to the cubic spinal NiCo2O4 phase (JCPDS no. 20-0781). Besides the diffraction peaks of carbon
fibers and NiCo2O4, well-resolved peaks at around
14.3, 33.5, 43.9, and 58.4° are indexed to the (002), (101),
(006), and (110) crystal planes, respectively, which can be attributed
to the 2H-WS2 phase (JCPDS no. 08-0237). These results
also demonstrated the effective interparticle interaction between
NiCo2O4 needles and WS2 nanoplates
on the surfaces of the CC substrate.

The composition and valence states
of the WS2@NiCo2O4 core–shell
heterostructure were identified
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The distinct Ni 2p, Co
2p, W 4f, S 2p, and O 1s signals along with C 1s from CC were presented
in the full scan survey spectrum of WS2@NiCo2O4 (Figure S2). In Figure 4a,b, the core-level
XPS spectra of Ni 2p and Co 2p were optimally deconvoluted into four
main peaks that can be assigned to two spin–orbit doublets
and two shakeup satellites (marked as “Sat.”) by using
the Gaussian fitting method. Two peaks centered at 856.5 and 874.8
eV were corresponding to the Ni2+, whereas the other two
peaks appearing at 854.8 and 872.6 eV were ascribed to the Ni3+ (Figure 4a).36,37Figure 4b shows the Co 2p high-resolution spectrum where the
fitted peaks at 780.2 and 796.1 eV were attributed to Co2+, and the fitted peaks at 781.6 and 797.6 eV were attributed to Co3+.38 For the W 4f XPS spectrum,
the peaks appearing at 35.2 and 37.3 eV were attributed to W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2, which are originated from the W4+ oxidation state (Figure 4c).39,40 The peaks detected at 36.0 and
38.0 eV agreed well with the characteristics of W 4f5/2 and W 4f7/2 for the higher state of W4+ denoted
as W6+. The relative higher intensity of W6+ peaks further proved the higher content of tungsten trioxide oxide
deposition on WS2, which may be attributed to the slight
oxidation in air during thermal treatment. The S 2p pattern in Figure 4d can be fitted with
three pairs of the peaks (S 2p): the first pair of 163.5 and 170.1
eV, the second pair of 162.4 and 169.6 eV, and the third pair of 161.3
and 168.6 eV. The peaks at 170.1, 169.6, and 168.6 eV are associated
with the residual SO42– substance.41−43 The other peaks which are centered at 163.5, 162.4, and 161.3 eV
corresponded to the S2– ligand. The successful preparation
of the WS2@NiCo2O4 core–shell
structure was proved by the anchored mixed composition of Co2+, Co3+, Ni2+, Ni3+, W4+, and S2– on the surface of the WS2@NiCo2O4 heterostructure in addition to the various metal–sulfur
and metal–oxide coexisting in the interior and surface of the
structure. The above XPS results are in accordance with XRD and EDS
measurements.

The electrochemical performance of WS2@NiCo2O4/CC core–shell hybrid electrodes was evaluated
by a three-electrode method using 3 M KOH as the electrolyte. Figure 5a shows the cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves of WS2/CC, NiCo2O4/CC, and WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes
at a scan rate 10 mV s–1 between −0.4 and
0.6 V (vs Ag/AgCl). The CVs (with WS2/CC being an exception)
exhibited obvious pseudocapacitive characteristics with two pairs
of redox peaks which is likely due to the Faradaic reaction (Figure 5a). The redox reactions
of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode are
based on the following equations44−46 1   2   3   4  

Figure 5 (a)

and WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes

curves of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode

and (f) Nyquist plots of NiCo2O4/CC and WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes.

The integrated area of the CV curve of WS2@NiCo2O4/CC is significantly larger than that of the
individual NiCo2O4/CC and WS2/CC
electrodes. Two redox peaks of the NiCo2O4/CC
electrode located at ∼0.4 and ∼0.3 V could also be ascribed
to the pseudocapacitance redox reaction. However, there are two pairs
of redox peaks located at 0.16/0 and 0.35/0.30 V for the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode, which could be
probably caused by the redox transition between the WS2 nanoplates and NiCo2O4 nanoneedles. As expected,
the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode
showed the highest current densities and integrated area, indicating
the improvement in electrochemical capacitance because of synergistic
effects between NiCo2O4 needles and WS2 nanoplates. Although WS2 is known to contribute capacitance,
the CV curve of WS2/CC is minuscule compared to those of
NiCo2O4/CC and WS2@NiCo2O4/CC, demonstrating that most of the capacitance comes
from the pseudocapacitance of NiCo2O4. However,
it should be pointed out here that the enhancement of the electrochemical
activity of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode
was triggered by the use of WS2 nanoplate coatings, resulting
in the synergistic effect among the NiCo2O4,
WS2, and CC substrate. It is mainly due to the fact that
the combination of NiCo2O4 and conductive carbon-based
materials can significantly enhance the charge transfer and improve
the capacitance performance, while the special layered structure of
WS2 makes it easy for ions to combine, which can promote
the rapid adsorption and transport of ions. Through the core–shell
heterostructure of WS2@NiCo2O4, WS2 grows on the NiCo2O4/CC hybrid array,
and the original smooth NiCo2O4 needle becomes
very rough, and the head of the NiCo2O4 needle
is connected together, so that a large number of active sites and
proper strain adjustment appear in the WS2@NiCo2O4 heterostructure, which promotes ion acceleration and
electron transfer, thus improving the electrochemical performance
of the electrode and solving the problem of poor conductivity of WS2. As a result, the electrochemical performance of the system
was improved by the synergistic interaction of WS2 and
NiCo2O4. Figure 5b shows the CVs of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode recorded at different scan rates from
10 to 100 mV s–1. All CVs exhibited a strong redox
peak, reconfirming rapid redox reactions related to M–O/M–O–OH/W–S
associated with OH– in the electrolyte, where M
refers to Ni or Co.7,36 The linear relation observed
between the peak current at different scan rates confirmed the good
interfacial kinetics and high rate performance.47,48 The shift of the anode and cathode peaks to higher and lower potentials
can be attributed to the polarization effect of the electrodes.49 To further study the capacitive performances
of WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrodes,
the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests were conducted
in the potential window between −0.6 and 0.3 V at different
current densities (Figures 5c and S3). The observation of approximately
symmetric curves at all current densities are believed to be the main
reasons for the high charge–discharge Coulombic efficiency
and low polarization of the electrode.

The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode prolonged
the discharge time as compared to the WS2/CC and NiCo2O4/CC electrodes. The discharge time obtained from
these measurements showed a maximum for solvothermal reaction time
at 12 h (Figure 5d).
The minimum discharge time, measured at 16 h, is by a factor of around
4.0 lower than that found at 12 h, which could be attributed to the
poor conductivity of WS2@NiCo2O4 caused
by the high amount of WS2 in the structure. The excess
solvothermal reaction time (>12 h) may act as a trigger for the
reduction
observed in the discharge time of the WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrid electrode. An approximate symmetric curve and
voltage plateau regions can clearly be observed, indicating high Coulombic
efficiency during charging and discharging. Two pairs of obvious charge
and discharge platforms observed in charge and discharge curves could
be ascribed to the redox potential window of NiCo2O4 and WS2. As is well known, the pseudocapacitance
discharge curve has a voltage drop that is related to the internal
resistance at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte.50 This resistance triggers the redox electrochemical
reaction that occurs on the voltage platform. The rapid, continuous,
and multimaterial synchronization of the redox reaction rate with
the electron transfer rate offers the good electrochemical pseudocapacitance
characteristics, which is corresponding to the large voltage platform
(Figure 5d). The areal
capacitances (ACs) of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode can be calculated by using the data given in Figure 5c and benchmarked
against those of the NiCo2O4/CC and WS2/CC electrodes in Figure 5e. The ACs of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode were calculated to be 2449.9, 1878.4, 1325.6, and 928.9
mF cm–2 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, and 10
mA cm–2, respectively. After conversion, the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode could deliver
high mass-specific capacitances of 770.4, 555.7, 392.1, and 274 F
g–1 at current densities of 1, 2, 5, and 10 mA cm–2, respectively, which are much higher as compared
to that of NiCo2O4/CC and WS2/CC
electrodes. The synergism originated from the combination of WS2 and NiCo2O4 particles are responsible
for the improved ACs of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode. NiCo2O4 and WS2 appeared to have the open space between their needles and the mesopores
existing in the nanosheets, which could not only serve as a robust
reservoir for ions but also greatly enhance the diffusion kinetics
within the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode.

The outstanding capacitive performance observed in the case of
the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode is not
just a simple superposition of the NiCo2O4/CC
and WS2/CC electrodes. First, the highly ordered conductive
needle-like NiCo2O4 were uniformly dispersed
on the surfaces of the CC substrate. Then, a frame structure was formed,
which is beneficial to the electron transfer and diffusion in the
electrolyte. Afterward, WS2 coated on the surfaces of NiCo2O4 needles provided more efficient electron channels.
Furthermore, the direct contact between the surfaces of nanosheets
with the intrinsic conductivity to the CC substrate built up an express
path for fast electron transport, thus avoiding the use of the polymer
binder and a conductive additive which commonly added extra contact
resistance.

In order to verify that the electroconductivity
of the electrodes,
the electrochemical impedance tests were performed in the frequency
range of 0.01–100 Hz (Figure 5f). Nyquist plots of the three electrode samples confirmed
that the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid structure
exhibited the minimum charge-transfer resistance compared with WS2/CC and NiCo2O4 electrodes. The WS2/CC electrode has a large curve diameter and, thus, has a
large charge-transfer resistance, shown in the inset of Figure 5f. The NiCo2O4/CC electrode has a small curve diameter and good conductivity,
thereby having the capacity to improve the conductivity of the composite
materials. A typical semicircle in the high-medium frequency region
and an inclined line in low frequencies could correspond to the charge-transfer
resistance at the NiCo2O4/CC electrode/electrolyte
interface. Considering the Nyquist plot of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode, it could be said that the
charge-transfer rate of the NiCo2O4/CC electrode
became faster after incorporating with WS2 nanoplates.
As confirmed by the impedance spectroscopy measurements, the electrolyte
ion can easily diffuse throughout the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode and enhance the utilization of
active electrode materials.

Electrochemical processes in a flexible
SSCs were evaluated for
charge–discharge cycles (Figure 6a). A mixture of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and potassium
hydroxide (KOH) was used as a gel electrolyte, while Cu foil served
as collectors. The CVs of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid SSC device at different scanning rates in a voltage
range of 0–1 V (Figure 6b). Two pairs of redox peaks observed in Figure 6b are consistent with the two
voltage plateaus in the GCD curves (Figure 6c). The ions in the electrolyte can fully
react with the active material at a low scanning speed, greatly improving
the utilization of the electrode material.51 All the CVs exhibit a slightly sloping shape with the increase of
scan rates, indicating the effective interaction between the electrode
and the electrolyte (Figure 6b). Even at a higher scan rate of 100 mV s–1, the CV curve still has a clockwise response and pair of redox peaks.
The reason for retaining the shape of CVs at high scan rates could
probably be attributed to the lack of the restriction of mass-transfer
and ionic transport of charges between the electrodes (Figure 6b). All the entire capacitance
of the device benefits from the contribution of Faradaic pseudocapacitance. Figure 6c shows the GCD curves
of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid SSC
from 1 to 10 mA cm–2. The almost symmetrical charging
and discharging curves and small voltage drops observed immediately
after the discharge started arises primarily from good capacitive
behavior and high conductivity within the capacitor. The specific
capacitance of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC
hybrid SSC device can be calculated by using the loading mass of the
active materials. The ACs of the device are 196, 175.4, 125.5, and
82 mF cm–2 at 1, 2, 5, and 10 mA cm–2, respectively. From Figure 6d, the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid
SSC also exhibited excellent cycling stability with 85.59% capacitance
retention after 5000 charges–discharge cycles. It was found
that there is almost no change in Coulombic efficiency after 5000
cycles, which could be attributed to the excellent reversibility and
structural stability of an all-in-one configuration. The bottom inset
of Figure 6d depicted
nine charge–discharge profiles after 5000 cycles. The curves
remained symmetric and unchangeable after a long period of the charge–discharge
process. This result demonstrated that the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid SSC was a very reliable electrode
material with high cycling stability. To further confirm this result,
we performed the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the
used WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid capacitor
after the 5000 cycles (Figure S4). It was
clear that the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC capacitor
maintained its structural integrity without any separation and powdering.
The SSC assembled with WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrodes displayed a maximum energy density of 45.67 W h kg–1 at a power density of 992.83 W kg–1 (Figure 6e). Even
at a high-power density of 10,000 W kg–1, the device
still was able to deliver an energy density of 17.5 W h kg–1. Such high energy and power densities observed further confirmed
that the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid was
an excellent electrode material for SSCs. The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid SSC device showed much better performance
than those in some previously reported SCs assembled with CC/Ni foam-supported
electrode materials (Figure 6e, Tables S1, and S2).52−64

As is well known, such
flexible electrodes are anticipated to properly
maintain power supply upon repeated bending, folding, stretching,
or twisting without sacrificing the capacitor performance. The CVs
of the capacitor being bent at different angles at 10 mV s–1 nearly overlapped with each other and no apparent loss in calculated
capacitance indicated the stable performance of the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid capacitor at these states
(Figure 7a). By connecting
two WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid capacitors
in series, it gave a 2.0× higher voltage window compared to a
single capacitor with an output voltage of ∼1.0 V (Figure 7b). When two capacitors
were connected in a series configuration, the discharge time of the
assembly was found to be about half that of a single device discharged
at the same current density of 5 mA cm–2 (Figures 7c and 6c). However, this configuration rendered a two times larger
voltage window at the same current density. The active areas of the
device can be adjusted when WS2@NiCo2O4/CC capacitors were connected in series. The capacitance of the device
increases almost linearly as the area of series-connected WS2@NiCo2O4/CC capacitors increase from 2 to 10
cm2 (Figure 7d), indicating the possibility of integrating large-area WS2@NiCo2O4/CC-assembled SSC devices to enlarge
the output energy requirements. A real-time demonstration exhibited
that after charging at a current density of 2 mA cm–2, a three series-connected WS2@NiCo2O4/CC capacitor could light a commercial light-emitting diode (LED)
(3 V, 4.5 W) up to 9 min (Figure 7e). The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC devices connecting in series configuration can also supply power
to a calculator (3 V, 4.5 W) (Figure 7f). We represented a wristband made by connecting the
WS2@NiCo2O4/CC capacitors which can
serve as a wearable surgical and diagnostic implement in the promising
area of healthcare when combined with wearable sensors (inset of Figure 7f).

3 Conclusions
In summary, a core–shell heterostructure
of WS2@NiCo2O4 on CC was successfully
fabricated
by the two-step solvothermal method. The structural and chemical synergy
being existed between the WS2, NiCo2O4, and CC significantly improved the electronic conductivity of the
WS2@NiCo2O4/CC electrode, thereby
providing high ion-accessibility and low transport resistance between
the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC architecture possesses the mesopore structure
and open space between neighboring NiCo2O4 nanoneedles
which ensures fast transport of the electrolyte ions to the surfaces
of the electrode, leading to rapid charge transfer reactions owing
to the shortened ion diffusion paths. The WS2@NiCo2O4/CC-assembled SSCs provided a high energy density
of ∼45.67 W h kg–1 at a power density of
992.83 W kg–1. Based on the stable internal structure
of the hybrid electrode, WS2@NiCo2O4/CC SSCs also exhibits high cycling stability with an excellent capacity
retention of ∼85.59% even after 5000 cycles. Thus, we have
reasons to believe that the hierarchical core–shell WS2@NiCo2O4 heterostructure can be used
as promising materials for practical applications of advanced energy
storage.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
and Materials
Nickel(II)
nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), urea (CH4N2O), ammonium
thiotungstate (H8N2S4W), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), PVA, and KOH
were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemical
reagents were AR grade and used without further purification. CC (WOS1002
from CeTech) was obtained and treated with double distilled water
and ethanol.

4.2 Synthesis of the NiCo2O4 Needle-like Arrays Grown on the CC Substrate
The NiCo2O4/CC electrodes with NiCo2O4 needle-like arrays grown on the CC substrate were synthesized
by
the solvothermal reaction and a thermal annealing process. First,
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (1 mmol), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (0.5 mmol), and carbamide
(4.5 mmol) were added into deionized H2O (25 mL) under
magnetic stirring. After stirring for 30 min, the as-prepared pink
solution was transferred into a polytetrafluoroethylene autoclave.
Then, a piece of cleaned and acid-treated activated CC substrate (2
× 2 cm2) was immersed into the reaction solution.
Next, the CC substrate with Ni–Co precursors was sealed in
an autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 6 h in an oven. After naturally
cooling down to room temperature, the resultant CC substrate was removed
and carefully washed with distilled water and ethanol several times
to remove the impurities and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally,
the precursors were converted to NiCo2O4 needle-like
arrays by calcination at 350 °C for 2 h at a ramping rate of
2 °C min–1 under an air atmosphere. The mass
loading of the NiCo2O4 needle-like array on
CC was found to be around 0.4 mg cm–2.

4.3 Preparation of the Core–shell WS2@NiCo2O4 Screw-like Heterostructure
on the CC Substrate
First, the reaction solution was obtained
by dissolving H8N2S4W (1 mmol) in
DMF, and the resultant solution was then sealed in a polytetrafluoroethylene
autoclave. Then, a piece of as-prepared NiCo2O4/CC electrode (2 × 2 cm2) was immersed into the reaction
solution. Next, the autoclave was transferred into an electric furnace
and maintained at 200 °C for 12 h. After naturally cooling down
to room temperature, the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode was removed and carefully washed with distilled
water and ethanol several times to remove the impurities and dried
at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrode was calcined at 350 °C for
2 h at a ramping rate of 1 °C min–1 under a
nitrogen atmosphere. The mass loadings of WS2 and WS2@NiCo2O4 hybrids were found to be around
0.78 and 1.18 mg cm–2, respectively.

4.4 Instruments and Material Characterization
XRD characterization
was carried out at ambient temperature using
a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer. The XPS data were determined on
a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) excitation.
TEM observations were performed on a JEM-2100F microscope. The morphologies
of the electrode samples were characterized by a field-emission SEM
(JSM-7800F).

4.5 Electrochemical Measurements
All
the electrochemical measurements were performed by using a CHI760d
electrochemical workstation (Shanghai CHInstruments Co., China) at
room temperature. CV and GCD tests were conducted by a three-electrode
system in the 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The prepared WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid was used as the working
electrode. A Pt plate and an Ag/AgCl served as a counter and a reference
electrode, respectively. The following equation was used to calculate
the areal specific capacitance (Ca) of
the electrodes: Ca = It/sV, where I, V, t, and s are discharge current,
discharge voltage, discharge time, and size of the working area of
the electrode, respectively. In order to assemble the flexible SSCs,
a solid-state electrolyte was prepared by dissolving PVA (2 g) into
H2O (10 mL) and then mixed with 3 M KOH (10 mL) solution
at 85 °C. Then, the as-prepared two WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid electrodes were immersed into the electrolyte
for 5 min, then dried at room temperature overnight to evaporate excess
water. Hybrid electrodes were then assembled face-to-face, considering
that the impregnated polymer electrolyte into the electrodes will
be served as both the electrolyte and the ion-porous separator in
the resultant WS2@NiCo2O4/CC hybrid
SC device. As long as the electrolyte was solidified, a mechanically
robust cell could be tested. The energy density (E) and power density (P) of the full cell were calculated
by: E = 1/2CV2, P = E/t, where C, V, t, and m are the specific capacitance of the full cell, the discharge voltage,
the discharge time, and the active mass of the electrodes, respectively.
