The
present study was designed to investigate the antagonistic
activity of Bacillus licheniformis BL350-2
against mycotoxigenic strains of Aspergillus and Penicillium. In vitro coincubation for 5 days indicated Aspergillus westerdijkiae BA1 as the most sensitive
strain, with a growth inhibition of 62%, followed by A. carbonarius MG7 (60%), Penicillium
verrucosum MC12 (53%), A. niger MC05 (50%), A. flavus CM5 (49%), A. parasiticus SB01 (47%), and A.
ochraceus MD1 (44%). Likewise, the majority of the
tested strains on exposure to bacterial volatiles showed complete
inhibition of mycotoxin synthesis. In vivo assays on maize ears resulted
in 88% reduction in A. flavus CM5 growth
and complete inhibition of fungal sporulation and aflatoxin accumulation.
The GC–MS-based volatile profile showed 3-methyl-1-butanol
as the most abundant compound. The findings of the present study advocate
that B. licheniformis BL350-2 is suitable
as a biocontrol agent against mycotoxigenic fungi, at least during
storage of cereal grains.

==== Body
Introduction
Contamination of food and feed with mycotoxigenic
fungi and their
toxic metabolites is a persistent threat to human and animal health.
The ever-increasing list of mycotoxins includes more than 400 bioactive
compounds. Aflatoxins (AFs) and ochratoxins (OTs) are known as the
most toxic fungal metabolites and are produced by several species
of Aspergillus and Penicillium. Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are two important Aspergilli, responsible for the
accumulation of AFs in cereals and other food commodities.1,2 Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), among other toxicological properties, presents
strong hepatotoxic, immunosuppressive, and carcinogenic activities.3 The International Agency for the Research on
Cancer has classified AFB1 among group-1 human carcinogens.4 Ochratoxin A (OTA), after AFB1, is another important
mycotoxin, with nephrotoxic and possible human carcinogenic effects.5 The contamination with OTA of food and feed commodities
mainly results from the pre- and post-harvest infection by filamentous
fungi belonging to the species A. ochraceus, A. westerdijkiae, A. carbonarius, A. niger, and Penicillium verrucosum.6

In most countries, strict regulatory limits
for the mycotoxin contamination
in food and feed are enforced. The European Union has set a maximum
AF limit of 20 μg/kg for complete feedstuff and 4 μg/kg
for cereals and processed cereal products used for human consumption.
Likewise, for OTA contamination, maximum EU limits for cereals and
cereal feed products are 250 μg/kg, while for processed foodstuffs
this limit is 3 μg/kg.7−9

A key to prevention and
control of mycotoxins is the pre-harvest
management of the cereal crops and post-harvest storage of grains,
minimizing the favorable conditions (humidity, water activity, temperature)
for fungal growth. Field application of synthetic fungicides for the
prevention of fungal infections on cereal crops has shown promising
outcomes, but their residual transfer to the food chain is being strictly
regulated around the globe. Additionally, continuous and improper
use of these chemicals might result in unwanted outcomes including
the emergence of resistant fungal populations10 and induction of mycotoxin biosynthesis.11 To decontaminate the grains from mycotoxins, methods include physical,
chemical, and biological treatments.12 Another
approach is the removal of mycotoxins from contaminated food and feed
that involves their adsorption on binding substances including biological
cell walls or cell-wall-based formulations and activated materials.13 Apart from binding the target mycotoxins, there
is always a risk of depriving the animal subjects from dietary important
nutrients and antibiotics, which are sequestered in the gastrointestinal
tracts by adsorbents.14 Also, the binding
efficacy of the adsorbent molecule is a function of several factors,
including the nature, polarity, size, and concentration of target
mycotoxins and especially the pH of the medium.15 The noncovalent mycotoxin–adsorbent interaction
further limits the reliable acceptability of these substances.16

In recent years, to address the problem
of mycotoxin contamination
in food and feed, rigorous focus is being made on the preventive inhibition
of fungal growth. To this end, non-pathogenic microbes (yeast and
bacteria) are being explored for their potential to be used against
toxigenic fungi and their metabolites.17−19 The commercial efficacies
of biocontrol agents against the mycotoxigenic and phytopathogenic
fungi are primarily associated with the mode of action of each antagonist.20 The competition for space and nutrients, induced
resistance, production of antifungal compounds (antibiosis), production
of antagonistic volatiles, and secretion of enzymes inhibiting the
key metabolic processes are potential mechanisms by which bacterial
antagonists may inhibit the growth of toxigenic fungi. In these regard,
some strains of Bacillus licheniformis have also been reported to synthesize the diffusible antimicrobials,
which are effective against the important plant pathogenic fungi.21,22 The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential and nature of
the volatiles released/produced by a new antagonistic strain of B. licheniformis BL350-2 against the growth and mycotoxin
biosynthesis of AF- and OTA-producing Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.

Results and Discussion
B. licheniformis BL350-2 Inhibits
the Growth and Sporulation of Toxigenic Aspergillus and Penicillium spp.
The application of
biocontrol agents, especially bacteria, against phytopathogenic fungi
has been established several decades ago. Initially, the antagonism
was believed to be the outcome of direct bacterium–fungus interaction,
and their mechanisms of action were based on (i) iron depletion of
fungi,28 (ii) degradation of fungal virulence
factors,29 (iii) production of a large
variety of antifungal compounds,30 and/or
(iv) induction of systemic resistance.31 Later, it was realized that some bacteria and yeasts can also exhibit
biocontrol activities against fungi from a distance by producing volatiles.
For a long time, hydrogen cyanide was the sole known bacterial volatile
compound active against pathogenic fungi. Now, several bacterial volatile
organic compounds have been explored for their antifungal properties.18 In the present study, attempts were made to
demonstrate the antifungal features of volatiles produced by B. licheniformis BL350-2 against aflatoxin- and ochratoxin
A (OTA)-producing Aspergillus and Penicillium species.

The protein profile matching was expressed on the
log scale from 0 to 3 score, as per the manufacturer guidelines. The
score 1.70–1.999 is designated as probable genus-level identification,
and 2.00–2.299 represents confirmed genus-level identification
and probable species-level identification. The score 2.30 to 3.0 is
highly probable species-level identification. Our bacterial isolate
(coded as BL350-2) showed a matching score of 2.32 and was identified
as B. licheniformis. This score (2.32)
falls in the highly probable species-level identification. The test
was repeated thrice with the same score of 2.32. In vitro coincubation
experiments resulted in a significant reduction of the fungal growth
and complete inhibition of sporulation (Figure 1). This result was most likely associated
with the volatiles produced by antagonistic B. licheniformis BL-350-2 since the experimental setup ensured the lack of physical
contact between fungal and bacterial strains. At day 3 of the experiment,
except for P. verrucosum MC12, all
the volatiles-exposed fungal species showed significantly lower colony
sizes, as compared to their respective control (Figure 2). However, at day 7 of post-exposure, the
colony diameters of all the test fungi, including P.
verrucosum MC12, were significantly smaller than that
of unexposed control (Figure 3).

Figure 1 Antifungal
activities of B. licheniformis 350-2
volatiles against AF- and OTA-producing fungi. The fungi in
the first row were not exposed to bacterial volatiles, while those
in the second row, showing a significant growth inhibition, were exposed
to B. licheniformis VOCs. These pictures
were taken at day 3 of the experiment (after sealing the plates).

Figure 2 Effect of bacterial VOCs on the fungal colony size (mm).
For each
time point, measurements were performed on nine fungal colonies. The
asterisks indicate the significant (p < 0.05)
difference between the colony diameter of bacterial VOCs exposed vs
unexposed (control) fungi.

(control) fungi. Mycelial plugs were removed from the margins of fungal
colonies, transferred to fresh PDA, and incubated for 10 days for
the measurement of colony diameters (mm). Bars represent the means
of nine observations ± SD.

In general, very low oxygen levels (0.5% or even lower in the environment)
are needed to inhibit the fungal growth.32 In order to rule out the possibility that fungal growth inhibition
could be due to accumulation of CO2 or deficiency of oxygen
as reported earlier,6,33 we coincubated another set of
fungi, replacing B. licheniformis 350-2
with B. pumilus 344-3 (known for not
producing antifungal volatiles). In the presence of B. pumilus 344-3, there was no effect on fungal growth
(Figure 2) and sporulation
as compared to control, suggesting that the CO2 generated
or oxygen consumed by bacteria has no effect on fungal growth or sporulation,
rather these effects are associated with volatiles produced by B. licheniformis 350-2. In the present experiments,
either the test fungi were not sensitive to low oxygen tension or
the threshold levels were not reached. Additionally, dissolved oxygen
concentration in the substrate has a greater impact on fungal growth,
rather than atmospheric oxygen.34

In line with the present study, a significant reduction in growth,
sporulation, and conidial germination of A. flavus exposed to volatiles produced by B. megaterium KU143, Microbacterium testaceum KU313,
and Pseudomonas protegens AS15 has
been reported.35 In a more recent investigation,
the same group of researchers36 reported
that VOCs produced by B. megaterium KU143 and P. protegens AS15 also
exhibit antifungal activities against several other fungi belonging
to the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. GC–MS-based analysis confirmed that the biocontrol activities
were associated with the production of 5-methyl-2-phenyl-1H-indole by B. megaterium and 2-butyl-1-octanal, dimethyl disulfide, 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1-heptanol,
and 4-trifluoroacetoxyhexadecane by P. protegens.36 Similarly, VOCs produced by B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, and B. cereus have been reported
for their antifungal activities against Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Fusarium spp.37

B. licheniformis 350-3 Produces
Reversible Effects on Fungal Morphology
The volatiles released
by the B. licheniformis 350-2 resulted
in a significant reduction in growth and complete inhibition of sporulation
in all seven tested fungi. However, upon transfer to the fresh PDA
media, in the absence of bacterial VOCs, all the fungal isolates displayed
normal growth and sporulation, comparable with untreated fungi (results
not shown). In line with our findings, the effects of antagonistic
yeast Candida friedrichii 778 on toxigenic A. carbonarius MPVA566 and A. carbonarius AN6 were also observed as reversible.38 The reversibility in the morphological alterations highlights the
need for a continuous availability of bacterial VOCs to allow effective
biocontrol.

Mycotoxin Biosynthesis Is Inhibited by Bacterial
Volatiles
The effects of bacterial VOCs on mycotoxin biosynthesis
by toxigenic
fungi were quantified at day 10 of the coincubation experiment. The
UPLC-based analysis confirmed that exposure to B. licheniformis 350-2 resulted in a complete inhibition of OTA synthesis by highly
toxigenic A. westerdijkiae BA1, A. carbonarius MG7, and P. verrucosum MC12. Nevertheless, in the presence of bacterial volatiles, toxigenic A. ochraceus MD1 (21.84 μg/kg) and A. niger MC5 (29.32 μg/kg) were still able
to synthesize OTA, albeit the levels were significantly lower than
that of unexposed control (Table 1).

Similarly, under the influence of
bacterial VOCs, A. flavus CM5 and A. parasiticus SB01 exhibited complete inhibition
of AF synthesis, while high levels
of toxins were demonstrated by the control cultures. In line with
these findings, a significant reduction in AF synthesis by A. flavus exposed to VOCs produced by B. megaterium KU143, M. testaceum KU313, and P. protegens AS15 was
recorded.35 The inhibition of mycotoxin
production by the toxigenic fungi may be due to bacterial volatiles-associated
downregulation in the key genes involved in the mycotoxin biosynthetic
pathways in A. carbonarius and A. ochraceus exposed to yeast VOCs.23 At low levels of 2-phenylethanol (2PE), a common VOC produced
by antagonistic yeast, the AF synthesis inhibition is associated with
the stimulation of A. flavus growth
and decreased breakdown of branched-chain amino acid, which serves
as a precursor for the synthesis of AFs.39

Bacterial Volatiles Inhibit in Vivo Fungal Infection on Maize
Ears
In vivo assays using maize ears were performed in order
to investigate the effects of bacterial volatiles on fungal growth
and sporulation. Maize ears in the control group (not inoculated with
fungal spores) showed no fungal infection. Bacterial volatiles caused
a significant (p ≤ 0.05) reduction in the
presence of kernels infected with fungi [7.14 ± 1.97 (mean ±
SD)], as compared to high infection percentage (38.77 ± 6.22)
in the absence of bacterial VOCs (Figure 4). The presence of TSA media alone had no
inhibitory effect on the fungal infection of kernels.

Figure 4 In vivo fungal growth
inhibition by bacterial volatiles on maize
ears. Control ear-cuts (without fungal spore inoculation) showed no
infection (A); meanwhile, A. flavus growth was significantly lower on the ear-cuts exposed to bacterial
VOCs (C), as compared to fungal infection in the absence of bacteria
(D) or in the presence of TSA media (without inoculated bacteria)
alone (B).

In vivo fungal growth inhibition
by B. licheniformis BL350-2 is in agreement
with what was noted in the in vitro experiments.
Our findings are in line with earlier reports of antifungal activities
of VOCs produced by B. amyloliquefaciens SQR-9 against Ralstonia solanacearum infection on tomato roots.40 Likewise,
the volatiles emitted by B. megaterium KU143, M. testaceum KU313, and P. protegens AS15 showed similar activity against A. flavus, A. candidus, A. fumigatus, P.
fellutanum, and P. islandicum infections on stored rice.35,36

The AF content
in maize kernels was analyzed by UPLC and showed
no levels of AF in the untreated kernels and those infected with the A. flavus CM5 in the presence of bacterial VOCs.
On the other hand, in the absence of bacterial VOCs, A. flavus CM5 resulted in the accumulation of high
levels of AFs at 173.83 ± 13 μg/kg (mean ± SD) in
the infected kernels. The presence of TSA media showed a nonsignificant
difference on the AF production potential [181.22 ± 17 (mean
± SD)] of fungi.

3-Methy-1-butanol Is the Main Component of
BL350-2 Volatiles
Head space (HS) bacterial volatiles analyzed
through GC–MS
allowed identification of 32 compounds belonging to different chemical
classes, including aldehyde, hydrocarbons, alcohols, and terpenes.
In total, 28 compounds detected in the BL350-2 volatiles were also
recovered from the TSB media flasks (having no added bacterial) and
those inoculated with B. pumilus 344-1.
The three compounds (benzeneacetaldehyde, 1,5-dimethyl-2-piperidone,
and dimethyl disulfide) were produced by the tested bacterial strains, B. pumilus 344-1 and BL350-2 (Table 2). The only difference between the volatile
profile of B. pumilus 344-1 and BL350-1
was the production of 3-methyl-1-butanol by BL350-2, suggesting the
responsible compound for its antifungal activity. Recently, the synthesis
of 3-methyl-1-butanol by P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens SPS-41 and its antifungal activity
against Ceratocystis fimbriata infection
in sweet potatoes has been published.41 Also, some Bacillus spp. including B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, and B. cereus have been reported
for the production of 3-methyl-1-butanol, acting as a strong antifungal
compound.37

In conclusion, a new strain of B. licheniformis isolated from raspberry jam and
provisionally coded as BL350-2 was
tested for its antagonistic activity against representative toxigenic
strains of A. flavus CM5, A. parasiticus SB01, A. carbonarius MG7, A. ochraceus MD1, A. westerdijkiae BA1, A. niger MC5, and P. verrucosum MC12. In vitro
experiments on PDA media showed a significant decrease in fungal growth,
sporulation, and mycotoxin biosynthesis of the fungi exposed to bacterial
volatiles. Likewise, in in vivo experiments carried out on maize ears,
bacterial volatiles resulted in a significant reduction of A. flavus CM5 growth and complete inhibition of sporulation
and AF biosynthesis. Based on these findings, it can be concluded
that the 3-methyl-1-butanol produced by B. licheniformis 350-2 confers a significant protection from fungal growth and mycotoxin
accumulation, both in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Strains
and Media
All the fungal isolates used in this
study were obtained from feed samples, marketed in Qatar. Morphological
identification of these isolates was followed by PCR-based identification
using species-specific primers. Mycotoxin production potential was
tested on yeast extract sucrose (YES) agar, which contained yeast
extract (20 g), sucrose (150 g), agar (20 g), and magnesium sulfate
(0.5 g) in 1 L of distilled water, and by amplification of genes involved
in mycotoxin biosynthesis pathways.1

The B. licheniformis BL350-2 and B. pumilus BP344-1 strains used in this study were
isolated from raspberry and strawberry jams, marketed in Qatar (imported
from Turkey), respectively. Pure culture was obtained by streaking
isolated colonies on Luria–Bertani agar, prepared by adding
tryptone (10 g), yeast extract (5 g), NaCl (10 g), and agar (15 g)
in 1 L of distilled water.

Identification of Bacterial Strain
Identification of
the bacterial strains was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The ethanol/formic
acid procedure was adopted for protein extraction. Briefly, a loopful
of bacterial cells from colonies grown overnight was suspended in
300 μL of sterile distilled water. After thorough mixing, 900
μL of absolute ethanol was added, mixed, and centrifuged. The
supernatant was decanted, and to the pellets, 70 μL of formic
acid was added. After thorough mixing by pipetting, 70 μL of
acetonitrile was added and centrifuged. A total volume of 1 μL
of supernatants was transferred to a MALDI Biotarget sample plate.
The spots after drying were overlaid with 1 μL of α-cyanohydroxycinnamic
acid (HCCA) matrix solution. The mass-to-charge (m/z) spectrum was obtained by analyzing the samples
on a Bruker Biotype (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and identification
was made by comparing the spectrum with those available in the database.
The protein profile matching was expressed on the log scale from 0
to 3 score, as per the manufacturer guidelines. Before running the
test samples, the instrument was calibrated with bacterial test standards
provided by the manufacturer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).

Tests for in Vitro Antifungal Activity of B.
licheniformis BL350-2
The antifungal activity
of B. licheniformis volatiles was tested
by coincubation assays23 against aflatoxigenic
(A. flavus CM5 and A.
parasiticus SB01) and ochratoxigenic (A. ochraceus MD1, A. westerdijkiae BA1, A. carbonarius MG7, A. niger MC5, and P. verrucosum MC12) fungi. Briefly, from an overnight pure bacterial culture on
LB agar, a loopful of cells was suspended in Ringer’s solution
(0.9% NaCl). To find the best activity of absolute bacterial CFU on
the growth and mycotoxin synthesis potential of fungi, serial dilutions
of the bacterial cell suspension were made, and from each dilution,
100 μL was evenly spread on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates, prepared
by adding pancreatic digest of casein (15 g), peptic digest of soybean
meal (5 g), NaCl (5 g), agar (15 g), K2HPO4 (2.5
g), and dextrose (2.5 g) in 1 L of distilled water. This protocol
resulted in 12 to more than 500 bacterial CFU/plate of TSA media.
These plates were incubated without sealing for 24 h at 30 °C.
In the coincubation experiment, the cover of the bacterial plate was
replaced by a base PDA plate having inoculated fungal spores, sealed
with parafilm, and inoculated. After 3 days of coincubation, we realized
that 280–300 bacterial CFU produce enough volatile for the
optimal antifungal activity. After optimization, in further experiments,
we used only those plates containing 280–300 bacterial CFU
each. The lid of bacterial plates was replaced by another base plate,
containing a PDA medium point inoculated with 4 μL of fungal
spore suspension (106 spores/mL). The two base plates were
sealed together with four layers of parafilm and one additional layer
of sealing tape to prevent VOC escape. B. pumilus BP344-1, tested for not producing antifungal volatiles, was used
as a negative control. Plates were incubated at 26 °C for 10
days. The effects of bacterial volatiles on fungal growth and sporulation
were measured by recording colony diameters and morphology at days
3 and 7 of post-sealing. The control treatment was represented by
sealing fungus-inoculated plates with a sterile TSA plate. This experiment
was repeated thrice, with six replicates of each test fungi. Each
time, three plates of each exposed fungi were opened at day 3 of the
experiment (for taking pictures and measuring colony diameters), and
the rest were incubated until day 5 of the experiment.

To evaluate
the reversibility of the effects on fungal growth and sporulation,
at day 5, from the margin of each fungal colony, one plug (∼1
cm2) from each three replicates was removed with a sterile
scalpel blade and transferred to fresh PDA plates. These plates were
incubated at 26 °C for 7 days. The fungal growth and sporulation
were monitored on a daily basis and compared with the control group
(never exposed to bacterial volatiles).

In Vivo Antagonistic Activity
of B. licheniformis 350-2 Volatiles
To test the in vivo antifungal activity
of bacterial volatiles, full-grown sweet corn (Green Giant, Valencia,
Spain) ears were purchased from a local market. Each maize ear was
divided in two halves by making a longitudinal cut using a sterile
knife. Each half was further divided into three pieces, sterilized
with NaOCl (1%) for 2 min, washed twice with sterile distilled water,
and dried with absorbent paper.24 One day
before starting the experiment, B. licheniformis BL350-2 was streak-inoculated on 90 mm tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates
and incubated at 30 °C. Each disinfected maize ear cut was placed
on a sterile platform in a glass box (12.5 × 12.5 × 5.5
cm), below which an opened-lid bacteria-inoculated plate was placed
to allow the dispersal of volatiles. On the surface of maize ears,
8 μL of the spore suspension of A. flavus CM5 (105 spores/mL) was placed as a point inoculum. These
experiments were repeated thrice with three replicates each time.
Appropriate controls were maintained by incubating maize ears, inoculated/uninoculated
with fungal spores, in the absence of bacterial VOCs. The containers,
upon tight sealing, were placed in an incubator at 26 °C. At
day 21 of post-incubation, containers were opened and the percentage
of infection was calculated as: 1  

To evaluate the effect
of bacterial volatiles on mycotoxin synthesis, 5 g of infected kernels
was removed from each replicate and pooled to gather for the analysis
of AFs as described below. The mean values of the three experiments
were calculated and compared with untreated control.

Mycotoxin Extraction
and Analysis
To explore the inhibitory
effects of B. licheniformis BL350-2
on mycotoxin biosynthesis, another set of experiments having nine
fungal plates from each test fungi were exposed to bacterial volatile
by the method described above. Control fungi plates were sealed against
TSA plates not inoculated with any bacteria. At day 10 of coincubation,
colonized media plugs (n = 3/plate) of 7 mm diameter
were removed with a sterile cork borer, weighed, and shifted to a
1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.1 In the case of
smaller colony size, plugs from more than one plate of the same fungi
were pooled together. Three samples from each fungus were analyzed
for either ochratoxin A or aflatoxins (AFs).

OTA was extracted
from A. westerdijkiae BA1, A. carbonarius MG7, P. verrucosum MC12, A. niger MC05, and A. ochraceus MD1 infected media plugs, by adding
1 mL of HPLC-grade methanol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The sample
was sonicated (Bandelin, Berlin-W. Germany) for 1 h, filtered using
0.22 μm syringe filters (Pall Corporation, MI, USA), and stored
at 4 °C until analysis.25 Before analysis,
samples were allowed to evaporate in a SpeedVac and resuspended in
the mobile phase. OTA content was analyzed by using an ultra performance
liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters, MA, USA) equipped with
a Nova-Pak C18 column (4 μm × 3.9 mm × 150 mm) for
separation. The isocratic mobile phase was a mix of acetonitrile,
water, and acetic acid (45:54:1 v/v/v, respectively). A constant flow
rate of 1 mL/min was maintained. A fluorescence detector (FLD) was
set at 333 and 460 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively.
OTA was identified by comparing the retention time (3.563 min) of
the pure OTA reference material (Trilogy Analytical Laboratory Inc.,
Washington, MO, USA) with a target peak in samples. External calibration
using five dilutions of pure OTA standards with a mean correlation
coefficient of 0.999626 was used for quantification purposes.

For the quantification of AFs synthesized by A.
flavus CM5 and A. parasiticus SB01, colonized media plugs were dissolved in 1 mL of solvent mixture
of methanol, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate (1:2:3 v/v/v, respectively)
containing 1% formic acid.26 After extraction
for 60 min, a total of 0.5 mL of sample was transferred to another
tube and was dried using a SpeedVac (Thermo Fisher, USA). Before analysis,
samples were resuspended in the UPLC mobile phase, which was a mixture
of water/methanol/acetonitrile (250/55/55, respectively), and were
passed through the syringe filter (0.22 μm). The fluorescence
detector was set at 440 and 360 nm emission and excitation wavelengths,
respectively. A constant flow rate of 1 mL/min was maintained. Five
dilutions of aflatoxin mix standard solution (AFB1, B2, G1, and G2)
obtained from Trilogy Analytical Laboratory Inc. (Washington, MO,
USA) were used to obtain a calibration curve.

Collection and Analysis
of Bacterial Volatiles
The
head space VOCs produced by B. licheniformis BL350-2 were collected on activated charcoal.27 For this purpose, BL350-2 was shake-incubated in 200 mL
of TSB in 500 mL conical flasks, fitted with two-way rubber corks,
with two glass tubes passing through it. To the end of one glass tube,
a nitrogen supply system was attached, while its other end was placed
just 1 cm above the bacterial culture to remove the head space volatiles.
One end of the second tube was placed near the neck of flask, while
its other end was attached to a VOC trap. The trap was made of 6 cm
long glass tube of 5 mm diameter and filled with 400 mg of activated
charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA). Before use, the charcoal
was wrapped in aluminum paper and placed in an oven at 350 °C
for 48 h for sterilization. All the junctions including the neck of
the flasks were tightly sealed to avoid the leakage of volatiles.
The flasks were placed in a shaking water bath at 30 °C for 48
h. Control flasks contained TSB (alone), and the others were inoculated
with B. pumilus BP344-1 (not showing
antifungal activity). For each treatment, three flasks were maintained
for the analysis of VOCs. The nitrogen supply (200 mL/min) was introduced
10 h after inoculation of bacteria. The VOCs on the activated charcoal
were eluted with 1 mL of dichloromethane (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA)
into new glass vials.

Analysis of the volatiles was performed
using gas chromatography (GC) with an MSD detector (Agilent, CA, USA).
The samples were separated on fused silica column (25 m × 0.2
mm i.d., 0.11 μm). Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the
flow rate was maintained at 1 mL/min. Column temperatures were programmed
at 30 °C for 3 min and then increased at a rate of 4 °C/min
to 210 °C. The mass spectra of the unknown compounds were compared
with those of the NIST/EPA/NIH mass spectral libraries.

Statistical
Analysis
Data obtained from the in vitro
experiments regarding the effects of bacterial VOCs on fungal growth
and mycotoxin synthesis potential was analyzed by the analysis of
variance test (ANOVA). In the case of in vivo experiments data, if
ANOVA showed a significant difference among the treatment groups,
post hoc analysis was performed using Fisher’s Least Significant
Difference test. Means were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. SPSS statistical software (Version 23, IBM, NY, USA,
2017) was used for this purpose.
