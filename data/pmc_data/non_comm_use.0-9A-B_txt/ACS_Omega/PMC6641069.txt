The ability to image single molecules
(SM) has been the dream of
scientists for centuries, and because of the substantial recent advances
in microscopy, individual fluorescent molecules can now be observed
on a regular basis. However, the development of such imaging systems
was not without dilemmas, such as the detection and separation of
individual fluorescence emissions. One method to solve this problem
utilized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to enhance the emission intensity
of SMs. Although enhancing the SM emission intensity has yielded promising
results, this method does not fully utilize the unique plasmonic properties
that could vastly improve the SM imaging capabilities. Here, we use
SPR excitation as well as surface plasmon-coupled emission from a
high-definition digital versatile disc grating structure to image
and identify different fluorophores using the angular emission of
individual molecules. Our results have important implications for
research in multiplexed SM spectroscopy and SM fluorescence imaging.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) is a unique phenomenon wherein
a resonant charge oscillation forms at the surface of a metallic grating
structure as a result of light impingement on the surface at a specific
angle of incidence. This charge oscillation and resulting high-intensity
electromagnetic (EM) field can interact with and excite nearby dipoles,
such as fluorescent molecules, and enhance the fluorescence intensity.
In this case, we fabricated nanoscale gratings (Λ = 400 nm, H = 55 nm) using a high-definition digital versatile disc
(HDDVD) as a master mold in a soft-lithography process (see Figure S1a). This process yields very similar
results to those of other grating fabrication methods, such as E-beam
lithography, but is much less expensive and is less time consuming.
After depositing a thin, 100 nm silver coating, the plasmonic gratings
are capable of enhancing the fluorescence emission of rhodamine 6G
(R6G) and cyanine 5 (Cy5) dye films by as much as 100–200×
compared to that from glass substrates using a relatively simple epifluorescence
microscope for excitation and imaging.1−3 Additionally, these gratings
can couple wavelengths of light over a much wider angle range than
prism-based SPR platforms. The wider coupling capability of plasmonic
gratings makes these platforms ideally suited for the wide-angle excitation
provided by microscope objectives, as opposed to narrow dispersion,
laser-based excitation.1,2 We have previously demonstrated
that we are capable of imaging a wide range of fluorophore concentrations
using these plasmonic gratings and an epifluorescence microscope.2

However, an intriguing observation was
made when examining single-molecule
(SM) fluorescence on silver gratings with different polarization filters
and at different focal heights (Figure S1b). The emission intensity of a large SM population was found to exhibit
an angular emission profile that was similar to the anticipated emission
angle range of surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE), as illustrated
in Figure 1a. SPCE
is a phenomenon wherein a dipole, such as a fluorescent molecule,
can nonradiatively transfer energy to a plasmonic substrate, such
as a metallic grating. The transferred energy is converted into either
a radiative plasmon or lossy surface plasmon. Radiative plasmons are
subsequently emitted from plasmonic substrates as photons over a specific
emission angle range, whereas surface plasmons decay into heat.4 To date, SPCE has been primarily studied on the
macroscale using the projected emission pattern from flat metal films
and hemispherical lenses in a modified Kretschmann or Otto configuration.4−6 Consequently, very little to no information is available on SPCE
imaging on the SM size scale.7 As SPCE
and SPR are, in a sense, opposites of each other, wherein light is
coupled at a specific angle to form SPR and radiative surface plasmons
are emitted at a specific angle in SPCE, we can use the SPR dispersion
(Figure S2) to predict the angular emission
of a specific fluorophore (Figure 1b). Additional information on fitting of the angular
emission and determination of theoretical SPCE emission ranges has
been provided in the Methods section. By studying
the SM emission from SPCE, it is possible to not only obtain the emission
angle range but also to obtain substantially more information about
the molecular position in the EM field and dipole orientation. As
the emission angle range is also unique to the fluorophore emission
spectrum, it can be used to identify different fluorescent molecules
on, for example, a multiplexed fluorescent sample.

grating, (2) photons convert into an SPR evanescent field that excites

grating, and (4) a radiative plasmon is emitted from the grating at
the SPCE emission angle (θSPCE). (b) Calculated θSPCE range for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), R6G, and

2 Results and Discussion
To determine whether the angular emission was due to SPCE and not
dipole-related phenomena, SMs of R6G embedded in a 33 nm poly(methylsilsesquioxane)
(PMSSQ) thin film were imaged using an excitation polarizer and a
rotating polarized emission analyzer. Given the much longer exposure
time required to acquire SM images (∼10 s, see Methods), the resulting images were assumed to contain the
full angular emission range for each SM.8 During imaging, we observed two populations of SM emissions (Figure S3): the first population exhibited the
response seen in Figure 2a, whereas the second population exhibited the response seen in Figure 2b. In Figure 2a, two lobes or “split
emission” per molecule were observed wherein the emission was
primarily P-polarized. The absence of S-polarized light in the SM
emission is in agreement with the SPCE theory, as P-polarization is
the only polarization that is capable of being emitted by a plasmonic
grating from a radiative surface plasmon.4 If the emission polarization was due to the dipole orientation alone,
we would expect the orientation of the split emission to rotate with
the polarized analyzer, which was only observed from SMs that were
part of the second population.9

images with a polarized emission analyzer rotated
from S to P to S polarizations of single R6G molecules that display
(a) P-polarized SPCE behavior and (b) dipole-oriented emission behavior
that rotates with a polarization angle. Stacked fluorescence images
without a polarized analyzer taken at increasing focal plane heights
above the R6G molecules that exhibit (c) angled SPCE behavior and
(d) dipole-oriented emission behavior. Scale bar: 400 nm. Image exposure:
10 s.

Additionally, the SPCE mechanism
is highly dependent on the transfer
of energy from the dipole back to the grating to form a radiative
plasmon, which only occurs at short distances (10–250 nm) from
the grating surface.4 The time necessary
to nonradiatively transfer energy from the dipole to the grating (∼10–9 s) is on the same time scale as that for fluorescence
resonance energy transfer and surface energy transfer (SET). This
time scale is similar to the fluorescence emission time scale (10–9–10–7 s) from the dipole
itself. The variation in the proximity of the dipoles in the PMSSQ
film enables the observation of both SPCE (Figure 2a) and SPR-excited dipole fluorescence emissions
(Figure 2b). Roughly
half of the fluorophores observed in each fluorescent image exhibited
SPCE-based split-emission behavior, as seen in Figure S3. The remaining half of the observed molecules exhibit
SPR-excited fluorescent emissions from SM or multiple molecule behavior.

A difference in emission shapes between the two populations can
also be observed by increasing the height of the objective’s
image plane relative to that of the sample, as seen in Figure 2b. The split-emission SM seen
in Figure 2c spreads
outward from the molecule at a definable emission angle, whereas the
second population SM (Figure 2d) displayed an inverted, conical emission similar to that
observed by Böhmer with defocused images.10 Two additional fluorophores were imaged, FITC and Cy5,
at concentrations within the SM behavior range (1 μM–1
pM), to further test whether the split emission observed in the first
population is the result of SPCE. On the basis of the SPR dispersion
and excitation/emission ranges of the two dyes, FITC is expected to
have a wider and Cy5, a narrower emission angle range. As anticipated,
split-emission patterns were also observed with FITC and Cy5, which
had different angular emission ranges (Figure 3). The angular emission profiles were obtained
using the intensity profiles at known focal heights. Furthermore,
points of interest, such as the peaks, full widths at half-maximum
(FWHMs), and valleys of the profiles, at different heights were fitted
using linear models for each fluorophore. The resulting angles for
each linear model were then applied to the in-focus intensity profile
to obtain an emission angle vs. intensity relation for FITC (Figure 3a), R6G (Figure 3b), and Cy5 (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 Overlaid bright-field
and fluorescence images (left) of PMSSQ-coated
gratings with 1 fM (a) FITC, (b) R6G, and (c) Cy5. The fitted intensity
profiles (middle) were determined from the fluorescence images for
each fluorophore that were used to determine the normalized emission
angle range (right, FITC-blue, R6G-green, and Cy5-red). The emission
range has been plotted with the emission range predicted by the SPR
dispersion (gray line). Scale bar: 1 μm. R, grating ridge; G,
groove. The “peak” intensity is the peak emission location
for one lobe and “center” is the minimum intensity position
between the two lobes.

The obtained emission profiles for each dye correspond well
with
the predicted SPCE emission range (grey lines), with some variations
in intensity between the two lobes of the split emissions. In theory,
an excited dye molecule located in the middle of a grating groove
has an equal probability of nonradiatively transferring its energy
to either grating ridge paralleling the groove. However, closer proximity
to either ridge will result in a higher probability of energy transfer
according to the SET model.11 As the placement
of the dye molecule is random within the pits of the grating structure,
the molecule may be located closer to one side of the groove than
the other. To further illustrate the difference in lobe-to-lobe intensity,
a histogram comparing the relative intensities of the two lobes for
several R6G molecules has been provided in Figure S4. It was found that most of the
observed SMs (∼75%) had less than 5% variation in the intensity
emitted from the same molecule between lobes, and the maximum variation
in intensity observed between the lobes was ∼30%. It may be
possible to locate the precise XYZ location of a
molecule within the grating groove on the basis of the relative intensity
of the two lobes and focal plane location, but this requires a secondary
localization precision method to confirm the location of the molecules,
which is beyond the scope of our measurement capabilities.

The
intensity profiles of two representative SMs for each population
were also compared to determine the image resolution in Figure 4. The FWHM was found to be
∼327 nm on the basis of the intensity profile of the diffraction-limited
population (Figure 4a). Given that the wavelengths of most of the photons collected in
these images are between 542 and 600 nm and that an airy disc pattern
with distinct zero- and first-order diffraction modes can be seen,
this population is certainly diffraction-limited. However, the lobes
of the split emission (Figure 4b) have a much better resolution, with an FWHM of ∼233
and ∼217 nm for each lobe. Additionally, the spacing between
the two lobes was shorter at ∼164 nm. The diffraction limit
can be roughly estimated to be between 230 and 260 nm on the basis of the Rayleigh
criterion, which is larger than the FWHM and a much larger spacing
of the split-emission pattern. This increase in image resolution can
be expected if the split emission is due to SPCE, as subdiffraction
limit information would be transmitted into the far field.

The ability to obtain subdiffraction
limit resolution using a plasmonic
grating, as well as obtaining angle-based spectroscopic information
from individual molecules via simple defocus microscopy techniques,
has many advantages over conventional super resolution microscopy.
First, defocus microscopy is much less expensive than conventional
super resolution as a spectrometer and highly sensitive camera are
no longer required. Another advantage is the ability to identify fluorescent
molecules on the basis of their emission spectrums without the need
for an emission filter to screen out other types of fluorescent molecules,
which has many applications in filterless, multiplexed imaging.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that it
is possible to image SM
SPCE from plasmonic gratings using a simple epifluorescence microscope.
From these images, we can extract the angular emission profiles for
individual dye molecules that can be used to identify the type of
fluorophore and improve localization precision. Plasmonic gratings
can also be used to improve the image resolution to below the diffraction
limit. This imaging technique can be easily applied to other SM research
applications by substituting glass or quartz substrates for plasmonic
gratings to greatly improve fluorophore identification and emission
intensity image resolution.

4 Methods
4.1 Grating
Fabrication
PMSSQ gratings
were fabricated using a soft-lithography process, with cleaned HDDVD
(Memorex) halves as master molds to cast poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS,
Sylgard-184; Gelest) stamps. The grating profile was transferred to
silicon wafers by spin casting (3000 rpm, 30 s) a 3 wt % solution
of PMSSQ (Techniglass) dissolved in pure ethanol onto the PDMS stamp
and placing the stamping in contact with the wafer for ∼5 s
before removal. PMSSQ gratings were cured at 60 °C for 3 h on
a hotplate. The gratings were coated with a 5 nm thin titanium film
followed by a 100 nm thin silver film using RF sputtering. Silver
was protected from corrosion using a 10 nm thin Al2O3 film deposited via atomic layer deposition.1

4.2 Sample Preparation and
Analysis
FITC,
R6G, and Cy5 were diluted to 10–15 M in 200 proof ethanol with 1 wt % PMSSQ and spin-casted
onto the finished gratings to yield a 33 nm PMSSQ thin film, which
was cured at 60 °C for 10 min. The fluorophore density of the
film was measured to be ∼4 molecules per 10 × 10 μm2 area. The molecular emissions used for emission angle analysis
were confirmed to be emitted from individual molecules on the basis
of the observation of a single-step photobleaching event in a time
trace analysis for each molecule (Figure S5).

Reflectivity peak position and FWHM were used to obtain
the air-incident SPR dispersion (θSPCE,air), which
was converted to oil-incident (n = 1.518) SPR dispersion.
The normalized emission spectra (Ifluorophore) for FITC, R6G, and Cy5 were multiplied by the respective bandpass
emission filter transmission spectra (Tem filter), the microscope objective’s transmission spectrum (Tobjective), and the spectral sensitivity of
the camera (qCMOS). The resulting spectra
were multiplied by the oil-incident SPR dispersion to convert the
intensity related to wavelength into angular emission 1  ImageJ software was used to obtain the intensity
profiles of individual fluorophores at known focal plane heights.
The intensity profile points were fitted across all of the image planes
to determine the angular spread of the intensity profile as the SM
was defocused.

4.3 Experimental Setup
Grating reflectivity
was captured using a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer. Samples
were imaged using an Olympus BX51WI epifluorescence microscope equipped
with a Lambda XL light source; excitation polarizer; fluorescence
filter cubes for FITC, R6G, and Cy5; rotatable, polarized analyzer;
UAPON 100×OI TIRF objective (1.49 NA); and an ORCA-Flash 2.8
CMOS camera. Fluorescence videos were captured with an exposure time
of 10 s. A diagram of the experimental setup has been included in
the Supporting Information document (Figure S1).
