Crystal structure has a strong influence
on the luminescence properties
of lanthanide-doped materials. In this work, we have investigated
the thermally induced structural transition in Gd2Hf2O7 (GHO) using Eu3+ ions as the spectroscopic
probe. It was found that complete phase transition from the disordered
fluorite phase (DFP) to the ordered pyrochlore phase (OPP) can be
achieved in GHO with the increase of annealing temperature from 650
→ 1100 → 1300 °C. OPP is the more stable structural
form for the GHOE nanoparticles (NPs) annealed at a higher temperature
based on the energy calculation by density functional theory (DFT).
The asymmetry ratio of the GHOE-650 NPs was the highest, whereas the
quantum yield, luminescence intensity, and lifetime values of the
GHOE-1300 NPs were the highest. Emission intensity of Eu3+ ions increases significantly with the phase transition from the
DFP to OPP phase and is attributed to the higher radiative transition
rate (281 s–1) of the 5D0 level
of the Eu3+ ion in the environment with relatively lower
symmetry (C2v) because
of the increase of crystal size. As the structure changes from DFP
to OPP, radioluminescence showed tunable color change from red to
orange. The Eu3+ local structure obtained from DFT calculation
confirmed the absence of inversion symmetry in the DFP structure,
which is consistent with the experimental emission spectra and Stark
components. We also elucidated the host to dopant optical energy transfer
through density of states calculations. Overall, our current studies
present important observations for the GHOE NPs: (i) thermally induced
order–disorder phase transition, (ii) change of point group
symmetry around Eu3+ ions in the two phases, (iii) high
thermal stability, and (iv) tunability of radioluminescent color.
This work provides fundamental understanding of the relationship between
the crystal structure and photophysical properties of lanthanide-doped
materials and helps design a strategy for advanced optoelectronic
materials.

1 Introduction
Materials with A2B2O7 composition
belonging to the pyrochlore group have been the focal point of research
in the scientific community for the past few decades owing to their
various interesting properties such as low thermal conductivity, high
dielectric constant, suitable refractive index, high structural stability,
high radiation stability, and so forth. These properties enable them
to be suitable for many applications such as catalysis,1 phosphor,2 nuclear
waste host,3 scintillator,2,4 defect fluorescence,5 magnetism,6 thermal barrier coatings,7 and sensors.8 They are known to exist
in two structural variants: ordered pyrochlore (OP, Fd3̅m) and disordered fluorite (DF, Fm3̅m). OP is structurally very close
to DF, except it has two cationic sites, three anionic sites located
at 48f (Oa), 8a (Ob), and 8b (Oc)
Wyckoff positions, and 1/8th of oxygen ions at the 8b site are missing.
Hence, they are considered as similar phases but with different degrees
of anion and cation ordering. The phase transition is normally induced
by chemical doping,9 pressure,10 temperature,11 irradiation,12 and so forth. The ionic radius ratio (IRR) plays
an important role in the structural phase transition of DF ⇄
OP. It is reported that the OP phase is stable when the IRR value
is greater than 1.46, while the DF phase is the more stable phase
when the IRR value is below 1.46.13 Some
of the complex A2B2O7 oxides fall
in the “boundary” region with IRR ∼1.46, where
they can have the DF structure or the OP structure depending on the
synthesis conditions adopted.

Among various A2B2O7 compounds,
Gd2Hf2O7 (GHO) stands out owing to
its interesting properties such as high dielectric constant, wide
temperature range of phase stability, and high melting point, which
gives GHO broad application potentials as magnetic materials,14,15 high dielectric constant materials,16 high-temperature ceramics, solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel
cells,17 and thermal barrier coatings.18 GHO has a cubic structure as well as high Zeff, making it a potential host lattice for
scintillators.19,20 Moreover, given its high melting
point and high structural and thermal stabilities, it can be a potential
host for lanthanide ion-doped phosphor. The IRR of GHO is approximately
around 1.48 (close to 1.46),21 so it is
expected that the DF and OP phases can coexist in GHO depending on
the synthesis conditions.

Recently, many studies have revealed
that precise architectural
manipulation of nanomaterials have fetched lots of scientific attention
because the properties of nanocrystals depend strongly on shape, size,
and structure.22 It is reported that when
GHO is synthesized at a nanodomain, it can undergo DF to OP phase
transition at temperatures above 1300 °C.13 The phase transition proceeds via formation of the pyrochlore
nanoparticles (NPs) in the matrix of well-crystallized fluorite. Therefore,
it becomes imperative to probe the structural phase transition and
its influence on the luminescence properties of GHO from the perspective
of using it as a host for other lanthanide-based phosphors and scintillators.
Recently, it was found that the crystal structure plays a very important
role in designing efficient luminescent materials. The hexagonal structure
of GdF3:Eu3+ was found to be more efficient
phosphor than its orthorhombic counterpart.22 Similarly, hexagonal EuF3 is more efficient luminescent
material compared to orthorhombic EuF3.23 There is very scarce literature collection on the optical
properties of GHO pyrochlore. Previously, Papan et al. have carried
out luminescence spectroscopy and Judd–Ofelt analysis on the
combustion-synthesized europium-doped Y2Hf2O7, GHO, and Lu2Hf2O7.24 Our group has also investigated the effect of
A-site ions on the structural and optical properties of a series of
europium-doped rare-earth hafnate RE2Hf2O7 NPs (RE = Y, La, Pr, Gd, Er, Lu).25 There have been few work on luminescence properties of europium
ion-doped gadolinium-based pyrochlores, such as zirconate, titanate,
and stannate, wherein fundamental photophysical properties of Eu3+, its symmetry, and red-emitting phosphor applications have
been discussed.26−29 Zhang et al. observed high intensity of 5D0 → 7F1 transition than that of 5D0 → 7F2 transition.30 Their group has also investigated the effect
of codoping V5+ ions on an orange/red emission ratio of
Gd2Ti2O7:Eu3+ phosphor.
Liao et al. have investigated a similar trend which indicated a local
symmetry of the Eu3+ ion in the GSO crystal lattice has
an inversion center of the Gd3+ ion with the D3d point group.31 None of the reported work investigated the thermally induced disorder–order
phase transition and its effect on photo- and radioluminescence properties
of lanthanide-doped GHO NPs for possible applications in UV-based
phosphors and scintillators.

Temperature is an important physical
parameter that can alter lattice
spacing and modify the band and therefore the electronic properties
of various materials. By executing high-temperature annealing, one
can modulate the structures, create novel properties, and bring out
the phenomena not observed at ambient conditions.32−34 Thermally induced
structural phase transition of pyrochlore NPs would be expected to
unravel various interesting optical properties. Therefore, it is of
great interest to explore the disorder–order phase transition
and luminescence properties of nanosized GHOE under various annealing
temperatures. Up until now, there has been no report about the thermally
induced structural transition and its implication on photo- and radioluminescence
(RL) properties of nanosized GHOE. The studies on the high-temperature
annealing of nanosized GHOE would be of great significance not only
to fundamental and applied research but also would give new insights
into the nature of the A2B2O7 system.

In this study, we have first synthesized GHO NPs using a molten-salt
synthesis (MSS) method at a relatively low temperature of 650 °C.
We have doped 5.0% of trivalent europium ions into GHO (GHOE) with
the aim of exploring GHO as a host for phosphors and scintillators,
which has never been reported before. A europium ion is selected because
its electronic transitions are strongly affected by the structural
change, coordination number, crystal field, and so forth. We correlated
the change of its photoluminescence (PL) properties as GHO undergoes
the DF phase (DFP) → OP phase (OPP) phase transition using
europium ions as a spectroscopic probe.35 Because DFP has a disordered array of cations/anions, whereas the
opposite prevails in OPP, structural changes could be easily identified
based on PL properties such as asymmetry ratio, Stark splitting, and
lifetime of europium ions. The goals of this work include the synthesis
of GHOE with the DFP structure at low temperature using our MSS procedure,
the investigation of thermally induced structural phase transition
and its implication on the photo- and radioluminescence properties
of GHOE, and the determination of various optical parameters for the
GHOE samples. Therefore, our work does not only exploit the potential
of this interesting material as light-emitting phosphor and scintillator
but also unveils a phase-dependent design strategy to develop materials
with desirable properties. We have also explored the thermal stability
of GHOE NPs for possible application in thermal sensors and high-temperature
luminescence.

The phase transition from DF to OP at high temperature
is further
supported by density functional theory (DFT)-calculated cohesive energies
of both GHO and GHOE. DFT calculations were performed to study the
relative phase stability of DF and OP phases of both GHO and GHOE.
DFT calculation results were used to bring out the structure–PL
correlation by explaining the origin of intense hypersensitive electric
dipole transition (EDT) and large spectral splitting. The complete
host to europium energy transfer is also explained using density of
state (DOS) calculations for both GHO and GHOE.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
by X-ray Diffraction,
Raman Spectroscopy, and Scanning Electron Microscopy
Figure S1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the GHO-650, GHOE-650, GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300 NPs to see any
kind of phase transition or structural evolution. All patterns and
the corresponding 2θ and hkl values are in
agreement with DFP,18 which reveals that
all of the GHO and GHOE NPs are single phased with the Fm3̅m space group. There is no evidence of the
diffraction peak corresponding to the pyrochlore phase (space group Fd3̅m), which is characterized by
the occurrence of superlattice reflections with 2θ at 29°,
37°, and 44.7°. It is reported that the formation of the
OP completes at an annealing temperature of ∼1000–1200
°C for 3 h, and the pyrochlore phase is detected by diffraction
techniques.13 In another work, Popov et
al. have also observed the formation of the OP structure from GHO
NPs at 1200–1300 °C.36−38 However, our XRD results
do not reveal the OP phase even from the GHOE-1300 NPs. Because of
the closeness of the atomic numbers of gadolinium (Z = 64) and hafnium (Z = 72), the superstructure
reflections are too small to be observed by nonresonant diffraction
studies to confirm the formation of the long-range cationic order
of the pyrochlore phase.38

As can
be seen from Table 1, there is a proportional increase in crystalline size of the GHOE
NPs as a function of annealing temperature. This can also be seen
from the narrowing of the XRD peaks at a higher annealing temperature.
Moreover, the doping of the europium ion does not distort the basic
structural network of GHO.

Figure 1a shows
the Raman spectra of the GHO-650, GHOE-650, GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300
NPs. Raman spectroscopy is one of the most sought out techniques to
differentiate the OP and DF phases of A2B2O7 compounds, which is difficult to achieve using XRD. It is
well documented in the literature based on the group theory that there
are a total of six Raman active vibrational modes existing in the
wavenumber range of 200–1000 cm–1 for the
OP phase, which are ΓOP = A1g + Eg + 4F2g.39,40 On the other hand,
because seven O2– ions are randomly oriented over
the eight anionic sites leading to high level of structural disordering,
the DF phase has mainly one active Raman mode F2g. Phase
transition from the A2B2O6O′
P (Fm3̅m space group, Z = 8) to perfect AO2 F (Fd3̅m, Z = 4) structure proceeds by disappearance
of A1g and Eg Raman modes and decrease in the
number of F2g modes from 4 to 1. IRR (rA/rB) plays an important role
in determining the type of structure which A2B2O7 composition is going to attain.41 It is reported that if IRR is less than 1.46, the DF phase
is more likely to form and if it exceeds 1.46, it is the OP phase,
which is more likely to be stabilized at room temperature. As discussed
earlier, GHO exists in the phase boundary of OP ⇔ DF phase
transition as its IRR value is 1.48.

GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300
NPs. SEM images of the (b) GHOE-650, (c) GHOE-1100, and (d) GHOE-1300
NPs.

The Raman spectrum of the GHO-650
NPs (Figure 1a) consists
of a single broad peak characteristic
of the DF phase. Moreover, europium-doped GHOE-650 NPs also exist
in the DF phase, which indicates that europium doping does not change
the basic fluorite network of GHO. However, after the GHOE-650 NPs
are annealed at 1100 and 1300 °C, there is an induction of pyrochlore
ordering in the GHOE NPs. There is an evolution of pyrochlore peaks
at 1100 °C, which completely transform to the OP structure at
1300 °C. From the Raman spectra, we could clearly identify six
vibrational modes related to Gd–O and Hf–O vibrational
frequencies of the GHOE-1100 NPs. The peak positions are approximately
around 306, 321, 401, 500, 520, and 640 cm–1, which
correspond to F2g, Eg, F2g, A1g, F2g, and F2g, respectively.42 The vibrational Raman bands of F2g, Eg, and F2g modes at a lower wavenumber region
(300–400 cm–1) originate from vibrations
of the La–O and Hf–O bonds, whereas the F2g band at higher wavenumber (520 and 640 cm–1) comes
into picture because of the stretching of the Hf–O bonds. The
Gaussian deconvoluted Raman spectrum of the GHOE-1300 NPs possessing
an ideal pyrochlore structure is shown in Figure S2.

The observed change in phase Fm3̅m → Fd3̅m of the GHOE NPs is in line with the Ostwald’s step rule,38 as it is reported that the OP structure in GHO
has a low enthalpy of formation compared to the DF structure.43 The activation energy (Ea) of the thermal growth of the GHO NPs with the DF structure
was 65 kJ/mol in the temperature range of 800–1400 °C.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1b–d) show that the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100,
and GHOE-1300 NPs are either spheroidal or spherical and have certain
degree of agglomeration. The particle size distribution of the GHOE
NPs was calculated from these SEM images by ImageJ software as shown
in the insets. There is a progressing increase of the average particle
size of these GHOE NPs, that is 14 nm of the GHOE-650 NPs, 48 nm of
the GHOE-1100 NPs, and 57 nm of the GHOE-1300 NPs.

2.2 Cohesive Energies of OP and DF Structures:
A DFT Study
The DFT-generalized gradient approximation (GGA)-calculated
equilibrium lattice parameters, atomic positions, and bond lengths
are summarized in Table 2 along with previous DFT calculation results.44Table 2 clearly
shows that our values calculated via GGA–Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
agree well with previous GGA–PW91 calculated values and GGA
is sufficient to reproduce the insulating character of GHO. The lattice
constant (ao), the internal structural
parameter (x) which is related to the position of
O48f, the nearest Gd–O8b, Gd–O48f, and Hf–O48f distances and the band gap
are tabulated in Table 2.

Table 3 shows our
DFT-GGA-calculated cohesive energies of OP and DF structures of GHO,
and the OP structure is stable with respect to DF. In the bulk state,
the OP structure is favorable with respect to the DF structure. Moreover,
Jiang et al.45 and Li et al.46 have shown that the ground state structure of
GHO is OP. They have also calculated OP to DF transformation temperatures
for several pyrochlores. Therefore, our DFT results are in agreement
with previous DFT calculation results. Further, our DFT-GGA results
show that with Eu doping (1 Eu atom in the 88-atom supercell), the
OP structure is stable with respect to the DF.

a The different energy values are
reported for the 88-atom supercell.

Our experimental results show that the crystallite
size increases
with increasing annealing temperature (Table 1). Increasing crystallite size implies lower
surface to volume ratio with approaching bulk characteristics. The
crystallite size of the GHOE-650 NPs is around 7.0 nm, whereas that
of the GHOE-1300 NPs is ∼50 nm. Raman spectra of the GHOE-1100
and GHOE-1300 NPs confirm the formation of the OP structure. Therefore,
the OP structure is favorable in the GHO and GHOE NPs after high-temperature
annealing and corroborating with our calculated DFT energetics shown
in Table 3.

2.3 Local Site Stability of Eu3+ Ions
in the GHOE NPs
Figure 2 shows the DFT-GGA-calculated distribution of Gd–O,
Hf–O, and Eu–O bond lengths in the DF structure with
Eu doped at the Gd site (Figure 2a) and the Hf site (Figure 2b). The solid black lines (at 2.29 and 2.56
Å) and dotted black lines (at 2.33 and 2.59 Å) show our
DFT-GGA-calculated Gd–O and Eu–O (Eu doped at the Gd
site) bond lengths in the OP structure, respectively. Similarly, a
solid blue line (at 2.08 Å) and a dotted blue line (at 2.25 Å)
show our DFT-GGA-calculated Hf–O and Eu–O (Eu doped
in the Hf site) bond lengths in the OP structure, respectively. The x-axis of the figures shows Gd atoms (1st–15/16th),
Hf atoms (15/16th–31st), and a Eu atom (32nd) in 88-atom special
quasirandom structure DF. The red and gray points show bond lengths
of Eu-doped and -undoped DF GHO, respectively. This means that in
the 88-atom supercell, there are 16 Gd atoms, 16 Hf atoms, and 56
oxygen atoms. If Eu is doped in the Gd site, then in the supercell,
1st 15 atoms are Gd, next 16 atoms are Hf, and the 32nd atom is Eu.
Similarly, if doped at the Hf site, then in the supercell, 1st 16
atoms are Gd, next 15 atoms are Hf, and the 32nd atom is Eu.

Gd–O, Hf–O, Eu–O, and Gd–Gd/Hf
bond length distributions of each Gd/Hf/Eu atom in the DF structure:
(a) Eu-doping Gd site and (b) Eu-doping Hf site. Solid black (blue)
lines show Gd–O (Hf–O) bond distances in the OP structure.
Dotted black/blue lines show Eu–O bond distances in the OP
structure. The configuration of EuO8/EuO6 polyhedra
when doped in OP (DF) is shown in the left (right) side of the figure.

The bond lengths in EuO8 polyhedra in OP are 2.33 (2
bonds) and 2.59 Å (6 bonds) which is ∼2% higher (2.29
and 2.56 Å) compared to those of GdO8 polyhedra. The
Eu–O bond lengths are ∼8.2% higher in EuO6 polyhedra compared to that of HfO6. Moreover, our DFT-GGA
calculated energetics shows that Eu doped at the Hf site is favorable
compared to the Gd site, and the energy difference is 6.13 eV in the
OP structure. In the DF structure, Gd–O bond distances are
distributed over the range of 2.16–2.60 Å in the form
of GdO6, GdO7, and GdO8 polyhedra.
The Hf–O bond distances are distributed over the range of 1.94–2.81
Å in the form of HfO6 and HfO7 polyhedra.
The Hf–O bond distances are distributed in a wide range compared
to an OP HfO6 bond length of 2.08 Å. In other words,
the chemical environment around the Hf site is more distorted compared
to that of Gd.

Figure 2 also shows
the change in the first and second nearest neighbor bond distances
because of Eu doping at Gd and Hf sites. The Gd–Gd/Hf bond
lengths change appreciably by Eu doping at the Hf site compared to
Eu doping at the Gd site. Moreover, our DFT-GGA-calculated energetics
shows that Eu doping in the Hf site is favorable compared to the Gd
site, and the energy difference is 0.74 eV. In addition, Figure 2 shows EuO8 (doped at the Gd site) and EuO6 (doped at the Hf site)
polyhedra in OP (shown on the left) and DF (shown on the right) structures.
The distribution of bond lengths and orientation shows that EuO8 and EuO6 polyhedra has inversion symmetry when
doped in the OP structure and inversion symmetry is absent when doped
in the DF structure. The emission spectra from different excitation
wavelengths and number of Stark components of the 5D0 → 7FJ (J = 0–4) transitions of the Eu3+ ion in
the GHOE-650 NPs (Figures S3b and 5) show that Eu atoms occupy a chemical environment
in the DF structure which has no inversion symmetry. These results
are consistent with our DFT-calculated results of the local structure
around Eu atoms, which also confirm the absence of inversion symmetry.

2.4 PL Properties of the GHO-650 NPs
Figure 3a,b show the
PL excitation spectra and the emission spectrum of GHO-650 NPs, respectively.
The emission spectrum displayed two emission maxima at ∼445
and 720 nm corresponding to blue and red emissions, respectively.
Such display of multicolor emissions (blue and red in this case) is
a characteristic of nanomaterials wherein the excited state dissipates
its excessive energy through various channels because of large number
of defect states within band gaps of nanomaterials.47 It is known that A2B2O7 pyrochlore type ceramics are rich in defects and more so in oxygen
vacancies.48 The Raman spectrum of the
GHO-650 NPs (Figure 1a) indicated that it exists in the DF phase with large concentration
of oxygen vacancies in its network. Eagleman et al. reported that
oxygen vacancies are responsible for visible light emission in La2Hf2O7.ref49,ref50 In addition,
we have found that electronic transition involving ionized oxygen
vacancies are responsible for such luminescence properties from our
earlier work on Nd2Zr2O7 and Gd2Zr2O7 pyrochlore.5,27 The
used excitation energy (∼3.37 eV, 332 nm) is less than the
band gap (3.42 eV) of GHO,19,44 so direct transition
from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) does not happen,
and there exist certain localized defect states within the band gap
of the GHO NPs. Such defects could arise during thermal treatment
of the GHO NPs or may be present intrinsically in them.49 The responsible oxygen vacancies for blue and
red emission in the GHO-650 NPs are presented pictorially as a mechanism
in Figure 3c. The blue
emission could arise from the electronic transition of singly ionized
oxygen vacancies to the VB, and the red emission from that of shallow
oxygen defect vacancies to deep ones. The proposed different origins
of these two emissions are consistent with the different excitation
spectra obtained with λem = 445 and 720 nm at blue
and red regions, respectively (Figure 3a).

proposed
mechanism of the blue and red emissions of the GHO-650 NPs.

2.5 PL Properties
of the GHO:Eu3+
2.5.1 Excitation and Emission
Spectroscopy
Figure 4a shows the
excitation spectra of the GHOE samples as a function of annealing
temperature. These spectra consist of a very strong band peaking at
∼263 nm, which is known as the charge transfer band (CTB) and
attributed to electron transfer from a filled 2p orbital of O2– ions to a vacant 4f orbital of the Eu3+ ion. The weak bands at 395 and 465 nm are due to 7F0 → 5L6 and 7F0 → 5D2 transitions of Eu3+ ions. The CTB as a La Porte-allowed transition has higher
intensity than the forbidden f–f transitions. The excitation
spectra monitored under various emission maxima (591, 630, 654, and
711 nm) are also shown in Figure S3a. Except
for the marginal change in intensity, the spectra remain the same
at different emission wavelengths. The emission spectra recorded with
263 nm excitation is shown in Figure 4b. For comparison, emission spectra recorded under
263, 395, and 465 nm excitations are shown in Figure S3b. The intensity of the PL emission recorded with
CTB excitation is much more intense than that with f–f excitation
bands. The emission spectra for all three GHOE samples consist of
five main peaks at 579, 591, 630, 654, and 711 nm corresponding to
the 5D0 → 7F0, 5D0 → 7F1, 5D0 → 7F2, 5D0 → 7F3, and 5D0 → 7F4 transitions, respectively.
There are several interesting features of these spectra: appearance
of 5D0 → 7F0 transition
that is allowed neither by magnetic dipole transition (MDT) nor by
EDT, large splitting in the spectral peaks, high asymmetry ratio (I5D0→7F2/I5D0→7F1), and presence of relatively intense 5D0 → 7F4 transition.

Figure 4 (a) PL
excitation spectra (λem = 612 nm) (b) PL
emission spectra (λex = 263 nm) for GHOE NPs.

The presence of 5D0 → 7F0 transition and large spectral
splitting are signatures
of the europium ion in highly disordered environment.50 This is supported with the fact of relatively high emission
intensity of 5D0 → 7F4 transition due to a distorted chemical surrounding around
the Eu3+ ions.51 However, there
are no changes of the spectral profile in terms of peak symmetry or
width on changing the excitation wavelength.

Based on the emission
spectra of the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300
NPs (Figure 4b), three
effects of annealing on the PL properties of the GHOE NPs were taken
into consideration. These effects include (a) emission intensity,
(b) spectral width of the 5D0 → 7F0 emission lines, and (c) the ratio of integrated
PL intensities between MDT (5D0 → 7F1) and hypersensitive EDTs (5D0 → 7F2), that is, the asymmetry
ratio (IRO).

First, the emission
intensity of the 5D0 → 7F2 EDT is much higher than that of the 5D0 → 7F1 MDT for all three
GHOE samples, suggesting that the Eu3+ ions are localized
in low symmetry sites. Moreover, the PL emission intensity increases
with increasing annealing temperature, which could be attributed to
the different crystallite sizes of the GHOE NPs. The GHOE-650 NPs
with the smallest size (∼7 nm) have the highest surface to
volume ratio, so are rich with surface defects. Such surface defects
act as nonradiative pathways to decrease emission intensity. On the
other hand, large-sized GHOE-1300 NPs have less surface defects with
high emission intensity.

In all these three samples, the red
emission due to 5D0 → 7F2 transition is the
most intense peak, and the color coordinates are very similar, so
only one of the representative samples, that is, the GHOE-650 NPs,
is shown with the International de l’Eclairage (CIE) diagram
(Figure S3c).

2.5.2 Point
Group Symmetry and Asymmetry Ratio
of Eu3+ Ions in the GHOE NPs
Structural change
of the GHO host can be corroborated with the change of Stark component
numbers from the PL spectral pattern of Eu3+ ions, which
is related to its point group symmetry.52,53 The original
point group symmetry of Gd3+/Hf4+ sites in both
OP and DF structures is D3d.16 Interestingly, the number of
Stark components (as highlighted with black asterisks) of the EDT
(ΔJ = ±2 and ΔJ = ±4) keeps increasing as the annealing temperature of the
GHOE NPs increases as can be easily seen from Table S1. Such changes are clearly seen in the PL emission
characteristics of 5D0 → 7F0 (Figure 5a), 5D0 → 7F2 (Figure 5b), and 5D0 → 7F4 (Figure 5c)
transitions as well. Accordingly, the point group symmetry of the
GHO host reduces to C4v for the GHOE-650 NPs because of lattice strain and distortion induced
by the small particle size and charge mismatch of ions after Eu3+ doping. Furthermore, it changes to D2 (for the
GHOE-1100 NPs) and then to C2v (for the GHOE-1300 NPs) because of the effects of annealing
and structural change, as depicted schematically in Figure 5e.

Figure 5 Stark-splitting patterns
of the (a) 5D0 → 7F0, (b) 5D0 → 7F2, and (c) 5D0 → 7F4 transitions; (d) asymmetry ratio of the GHOE
samples; and (e) schematic of the effect of annealing temperature
on structural change of the GHO host and the point group symmetry
of Eu3+ dopants. X-ray excited luminescence is abbreviated
as XEL.

The asymmetry ratio IRO is also highly
sensitive to structural change and useful to understand the local
symmetry around the Eu3+ ions in the GHO host. As the GHO
host goes from a highly DF structure to a highly OP structure, there
is a progressive decrease of the asymmetry ratio of the Eu3+ ions (Figure 5d).
The IRO values of the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100,
and GHOE-1300 NPs are 2.9, 2.0, and 1.6, respectively. This indicated
that the local surrounding of Eu3+ ions is highly asymmetric
in the GHOE-650 NPs with the DF structure, whereas the asymmetry becomes
relatively low in the GHOE-1300 NPs with the OP structure. Therefore,
the change of the IRO values is in accordance
with the structural difference of the GHOE NPs. Menushenkov et al.
also found that the Debye Waller factor as the measure of root-mean-square
deviation of the interatomic distance from the average value decreases
with increasing annealing temperature for all Gd–O and Hf–O
bonds of GHO by means of extended X-ray absorption fine structure
measurements.13 This confirms the increase
of ordering of the crystalline structure with annealing temperature
as reflected in the calculated IRO values.

Neither MDT nor EDT allows 5D0 → 7F0 transition of Eu3+ ions. However,
it is still often observed from Eu3+-doped inorganic phosphors
because of the CF-induced J-mixing effect that lowers
the symmetry.54 According to the selection
rule governing the EDT, this transition exists in low local symmetry
situations of Eu3+ ions, including Cs, C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C2v, C3v, C4v, and C6v.55 As shown in Figure 5a, the 5D0 → 7F0 peak of the GHOE-650 NPs which are stabilized in the DF phase shows
substantial intensity, and that of the GHOE-1100 and GHOE-1300 NPs
is nearly absent because of the pyrochlore ordering.

Based on
lifetime spectroscopy (Section 2.5.3), DFT-based cohesive energy calculations
(Section 2.2), and
local structure study (Section 2.3), Eu3+ ions can be stabilized at both Gd3+ and Hf4+ sites. Whatever the Stark component
is considered in this work, it is based on composite emission spectra
(Figure 3b) which have
the contributions of Eu3+ ions at both Gd3+ and
Hf4+ sites. To get individual emission spectra from these
Eu@Gd and Eu@Hf sites, we need to carry out time-resolved emission
spectroscopy (TRES) which can get individual spectra of Eu3+ ions at both Gd3+ and Hf4+ sites. We are trying
to establish collaborations to use TRES as our future projects.

2.5.3 Excited State Lifetime and Quantum Yield
The 5D0 emission decay profiles of all three
GHOE samples at the 5D0 → 7F2 transition display a biexponential behavior (Figure S4). Lifetime values were obtained by
fitting with biexponential function 1  where τ1 and τ2 are
actual lifetime values related to decay rates of corresponding
exponential components, and A1 and A2 are biexponential fitting parameters. Based
on the PL decay profiles corresponding to the 5D0 excited state of Eu3+ ions in the GHOE NPs and the lifetime
values obtained after biexponential fitting, the average lifetime
values were calculated using the following equation 2  

The average and individual lifetime
values were mentioned in Table 4. In the GHOE-650 NPs with the DF structure, Gd3+ ions exist in highly symmetric GdO8 in the form of a
cube, whereas Hf4+ ions exist in highly distorted octahedra.
The short and long lifetimes can be explained by the presence of two
different local sites of Eu3+ ions in the GHOE-650 NPs.
The short one is attributed to Eu3+ ions occupying the
distorted HfO6 octahedra, whereas the long one is attributed
to Eu3+ ions occupying the highly symmetric GdO8 site. Eu3+ ions also exhibited biexponential decay in
other pyrochlore hosts such as La2Hf2O7, Gd2Zr2O7, and Nd2Zr2O7 wherein one of the lifetimes is attributed to
A3+ site occupancy and other to B4+ site occupancy.33,56−61 Normally, the short lifetime is attributed to asymmetric environment
as f–f transition becomes relaxed, and the long lifetime is
mostly attributed to symmetric environment as f–f transition
is La Porte forbidden.59,62−65 The biexponential behavior can
also arise due to other reasons such as the presence of defects, energy
transfer, and so forth. This phenomenon has been substantiated with
theoretical calculations in the next section.

Table 4 Luminescence
Lifetime and Quantum
Yield (QY) Values of the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300 NPs
samples	τ1 (ms)	τ2 (ms)	τavg (ms)	χ2	AQY (%)	
GHOE-650	1.13	2.65	2.09	1.18	6.90	
GHOE-1100	0.92	2.67	2.27	1.12	7.35	
GHOE-1300	0.98	2.96	2.45	1.23	11.48	
On the other hand, the GHOE-1100
and GHOE-1300 NPs have the prevailing
OP structure where GdO8 is highly distorted scalenohedra
and HfO6 exists in highly symmetrical octahedra. In this
case, the longer lifetime is attributed to Eu3+ ions sitting
at HfO6 sites, whereas the shorter one is due to Eu3+ ions localized at the distorted GdO8 site.

The average lifetime values of the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100, and GHOE-1300
NPs were 2.09, 2.27, and 2.45 ms, respectively. The increasing average
lifetime values is partially due to the decreasing distortion of Eu3+ ions in the GHO NPs with increasing annealing temperature.
In addition, the surface defect density is the least for the GHOE-1300
NPs, so they have the lowest relaxation probability through nonradiative
transitions, and hence the highest lifetime value.

Furthermore,
the lower the nonradiative transition probability,
the higher the quantum efficiency. With the highest absolute quantum
yield (AQY) reported (Table 4), it is suggested that the GHOE-1300 NPs are the most suitable
sample for optical emitter and fluoroimmunoassay applications wherein
a high lifetime is needed. The lowest lifetime value from the GHOE-650
NPs is also reflected in the minimal AQY among all three samples.

Judd–Ofelt analysis was carried out for the GHOE-650, GHOE-1100,
and GHOE-1300 NPs with their radiative transition rate (AR), nonradiative transition rate (ANR), internal quantum efficiency (IQY), Judd–Ofelt parameters
(short and long range), and branching ratio values (Table 5). As discussed earlier, the
symmetry increases with increasing annealing temperature for the GHOE
NPs, especially for the GHOE-1300 NPs with a highly OP structure.
This trend in short-range and long-range Judd–Ofelt parameters
was justified with Ω2 > Ω4 because
the Ω2 and Ω4 values are highly
sensitive to the local structure around the Eu3+ ions.
It is also reflected with the highest and the lowest branching ratios
of β1 and β2 from the GHOE-1300
NPs, respectively, indicating the most contribution of MDT in their
PL emission process. On the contrary, the β2 value
of the GHOE-650 NPs is the highest, and the β1 value
is the lowest among the three samples. The trend of the IQY values
closely matches to that of the AQY values, consistent with the AR and ANR values.

2.5.4 RL Spectroscopy
RL spectra of the
GHOE NPs (Figure 6a)
consist of typical Eu3+ ion peaks from the forbidden EDT
4f → 4f (5D0 → 7FJ, J = 0–4) transitions
in the visible range of 550–750 nm. Materials that can efficiently
absorb and convert high-energy radiation such as X-ray or γ
ray into visible light can display wide array of applications in medical
imaging, radiation detection, and scientific instrumentation.66 In this context, our GHOE samples display unique
ability to convert highly energetic X-ray radiation into visible light
based on the RL spectrum.

Figure 6 (a) RL spectra, (b) variation of the RL asymmetry
ratio, (c) chromaticity
coordinate diagram, and (d) RL emission due to the Eu2+ ion (because of the reduction of the Eu3+ ions by X-ray
irradiation) of the GHOE NPs.

For the GHOE-650 NPs, the EDT peak around 612 nm is more
intense
than the MDT peak at 592 nm with intense red emission because of the
highly DF structure. After annealing at 1100 and 1300 °C, there
is reversal of the EDT and MDT peak pattern. Now, the MDT peak overpowers
the EDT one indicating the stabilization of the Eu3+ ion
in highly OPP, consistent with previous results. Hence, the emission
color changes from red to orange (Figure 6c), showing the RL tunability. Furthermore,
the more intense MDT peak of the GHOE-1300 NPs suggests that most
of the Eu3+ ions are located at sites with inversion symmetry,
consistent with the asymmetry ratio values (Figure 6b). Figure 6d shows the RL emission spectra because of the presence
of some divalent europium ion resulted from the reduction of some
of the Eu3+ ions on irradiation with highly energetic X-ray.
The peak around 545 nm is ascribed to the electric dipole-allowed
transition 4f65d → 8S7/2 (4f7) of the Eu2+ ions. Interestingly, the GHOE-650
NPs have the highest fraction of the divalent europium ion, whereas
the GHOE-1300 NPs have the least. This phenomenon is possibly (i)
due to the smallest particle size of the GHOE-650 NPs, and hence the
largest numbers of exposed Eu3+ ions on the surface or
the subsurface are subjected to the reduction reaction by X-ray irradiation
or (ii) the DF versus OP structure of GHOE-650 versus GHOE-1300 NPs.

The emission spectra under UV photon and X-ray are different because
the luminescence mechanisms involved in these two cases are distinct.
Specifically, under X-ray excitation, e––h+ pairs (excitons) are generated, and the Eu3+ 4f–4f
bands and hosts are excited together.33,56,57,67 In this situation,
e– migrates to the Eu3+ centers before
luminescence. Under UV excitation, only the Eu3+ (4f–4f)
bands are excited, but not the host. Moreover, the conversion of X-ray
excitation into visible light usually proceeds in four different steps.
In the first step, GHOE absorbs an X-ray through the photoelectric
effect and leads to creation of electron and holes. In the second
step, these electrons and holes relax to generate large number of
secondary electrons, holes, photons, and plasmons. Such relaxation
also induces several other electronic excitations. These secondary
electrons and holes lose their energy via electron–phonon interaction
to give electron–hole pairs with near band gap energy. The
third stage involves the transport of the electron–hole pairs
(excitons) through the host material to a luminescent center (trap)
and the excitation of the luminescent center. The final stage concerns
the resulting luminescence. Materials which have a high light output
and a short lifetime under photoexcitation may have a very low light
output and/or a long lifetime under X-ray excitation. This is due
to the energy losses and delays in the energy migration processes,
which are absent in PL where the luminescent centers are directly
and intentionally excited.

2.5.5 Thermal Quenching Behavior
of GHOE NPs
Thermal stability of phosphors is a very important
property for
their applications toward solid-state lighting and high-power light-emitting
diodes. Therefore, we have carried out emission spectroscopy of the
GHOE-650 NPs at various temperatures using in situ PL measurements. Figure 7a shows emission
spectra of the GHOE NPs measured from room temperature to 973 K. The
spectral features do not change with the increase of temperature.
At 298 K, the GHOE-650 NPs exhibit intense red emission because of
hypersensitive electric dipole 5D0 → 7F2 transition. However, as temperature increases,
there is monotonic reduction in emission intensity (Figure 7b). Such thermal quenching
is attributed to a crossover mechanism wherein europium ions are thermally
activated through the crossing point between the ground and the excited
states.68 The quenching temperature, T0.5, at which the emission intensity drops to
50% of that at room temperature, is about 625 K, indicating an extremely
high thermal stability of the GHOE NPs. The thermal population of
the charge transfer state (5D → CT → 7F) or the excited state (5D → 7F) increases the chances of nonradiative relaxation.69

Figure 7 (a) Emission spectra at temperatures ranging from 298 to 973 K,
(b) corresponding temperature dependence of the PL emission intensity
of the 5D0 → 7F2 transition, and (c) plot of ln(I0/I – 1) vs 1/kT of the GHOE-650 NPs.

In addition, the thermal quenching
activation energy of the GHOE
NPs was extrapolated from the slope of Figure 7c denoted from the following Arrhenius equation57 3  where Io is initial
emission intensity, and I is the emission intensity
at a given temperature T. For a given constant A and a fixed value of Boltzmann constant k, ΔE denotes the activation energy involved
in thermal quenching process. The relationship of ln(I0/I – 1) and 1/kT displayed linear behavior (Figure 7c). The activation energy calculated from this plot
is equal to 0.425 eV for the thermal quenching. In our earlier work
on La2Hf2O7:Eu3+ NPs with
an ideal pyrochlore structure, the activation energy value was found
to be 0.410 eV which is slightly lower than the defect fluorite GHOE-650
NPs.57

2.6 Efficiency
of Host to Dopant Energy Transfer
by DFT Calculations
Based on the DFT-GGA-calculated total
and partial DOSs, VBs from −4 to 0 eV of the OP structure have
a main contribution from the O 2p states and a small contribution
from the Gd 5d states (Figure 8a). The energy range is scaled with respect to Fermi energy
(EF), and the EF is set at 0 eV. The upper and lower panels show DOS contributions
from spin-up and spin-down components, respectively. The peak around
−2.5 eV corresponds to Gd f states in the spin-up component.
The lower part of the VB is dominantly contributed by the Hf d states
in both spin components. The O 2p states are contributing throughout
the VB. In the CB, a peak around 5.0 eV represents Gd d states with
a small admixture of the O p states. At the edge of the CB, Gd f states
contribute in the spin-down component. As a result, the electronic
band gaps in spin-up and spin-down components are 3.45 and 2.56 eV,
respectively. Figure 8b,c shows the DFT-GGA-calculated DOSs of GHO with Eu doped at Gd
and Hf sites, respectively. The overall DOSs have resemblance with
ideal GHO. Eu f states contribute strongly at the VB edge in both
spin-up and spin-down components. As a result, impurity states are
generated at the VB edge around the EF level.

Figure 8 DFT-GGA calculated total and partial DOSs of the (a) OP structure,
(b) Eu doped at the Gd site in the OP structure, (c) Eu doped at the
Hf site in the OP structure, (d) DF structure, (e) Eu doped at the
Gd site in the DF structure, and (f) Eu doped at the Hf site in the
DF structure.

For the DF structure,
the DOS features (Figure 8d–f) are similar to those of the OP
structure. However, less number of peaks presented in the DOSs of
the DF structure signifies positional disordering. In the DOSs of
Eu-doped DF, Eu f states contribute solely on the edges of the VB
and the CB in spin-up and spin-down components. The electrons present
at the VB edges participate in the photoexcitation. High contribution
of Eu f states at the VB edges makes optical energy transfer of the
GHO host to Eu3+ dopants favorable.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated the effect
of structural changes
of GHO NPs on their PL and RL using europium ions as a spectroscopic
probe. GHO and GHO:Eu3+ (GHOE) NPs were synthesized by
a MSS method at 650 °C and subjected to annealing at 1100 and
1300 °C with structural evolution. Raman spectroscopy confirms
the stabilization of the GHOE-650 NPs with DFP, whereas the GHOE-1300
NPs with a perfectly OP structure. The structure evolution from the
fluorite to pyrochlore phase renders a decreased asymmetry ratio of
the Eu3+ dopant. Moreover, annealing of the GHOE NPs increases
the luminescence emission intensity, quantum efficiency, excited state
lifetime, and Stark components, and change the Eu local symmetry from C4v (GHOE-650) to D2 (GHOE-1100) to C2v (GHOE-1300). The effect of disorder–order transition
is also evident from RL wherein the emission color changes from red
to orange. High thermal stability is an added advantage of this phosphor
for application in solid-state lighting. Our DFT results are corroborating
with our experimental findings. Moreover, DFT DOSs analysis shows
favorable localization of Eu f states in the VB of GHO, which makes
host to dopant optical energy transfer possible.

4 Experimental:
Synthesis and Characterization
Gd2Hf2O7 (GHO) and Eu3+-doped GHO (GHOE) NPs were
synthesized using MSS at 650 °C (GHO-650
and GHOE-650), similar to our earlier work for La2Hf2O7 NPs.2,4 However, by doping europium
ions into the GHO host, Gd3+ ions are replaced based on
closeness in terms of ionic radius and ionic charge. The GHOE-650
sample was further annealed at 1100 and 1300 °C in air for 6
h, and the products are noted as GHOE-1100 and GHOE-1300, respectively.
