The
realization of small platinum (Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in
conductive porous carbon would largely improve the catalytic activity
effectively with more durability, although there remain challenges
to achieve such hybrid nanostructures via a simple synthetic route.
Here, an efficient and facile profile was demonstrated for the synthesis
of one kind of uniform three-dimensional (3D) spherical Pt/C composite
electrocatalyst with small monodispersed Pt NPs embedded in the matrix
of 3D spherical porous carbon derived from the corresponding spherically
polymeric Pt(II) complex. The monodispersed Pt NPs within the uniform
3D Pt/C composite are ∼4.4 nm and they are dispersed homogeneously
within the matrix of 3D spherical porous carbon. Investigations showed
that the 3D Pt/C composite exhibits high catalytic performances as
compared to the commercial catalyst of Pt black for oxidation reactions
of ethylene glycol, ethanol, and methanol. This strategy developed
in the present study would be available for possible fabrication of
some other active 3D porous carbon-supported Pt-based catalysts including
their bimetallic and multimetallic counterparts.

1 Introduction
Fuel cells (FCs) have been considered
for a long time as a nonpolluting and efficient power generator for
substitution of fossil energies.1−4 Especially, low-temperature direct
alkaline alcohol FCs (DAAFCs) have been attracting increasing attention
for practical utilizations to date because of their portability as
serving effective power sources.5 However,
compared with common DAAFCs using methanol and/or ethanol as fuel
sources, direct ethylene glycol FCs exhibit some more evident advantages,
for instance, lower toxicity, higher boiling points, and higher theoretical
energy density with fewer regulation violations, making them more
practicable to work with.6,7

So far, many efforts
have been made to develop various anode electrocatalysts for DAAFCs,
typically as demonstrated in ethylene glycol oxidation reactions (EGORs).7−10 In
such demonstrated cases, elemental platinum (Pt) is still the key
component for the catalysis of DAAFCs, and many more catalytic reactions
have been applied to the applications of FCs theoretically and technically.
For example, there have been excellent demonstrations of catalysis
over various Pt and Pt-based nanostructures including hollow nanoframes,11−14 core@shell
nanostructures,15−17 and
nanodendrites18 with reduced sizes but
the increased surface area enhanced both specific and mass activities.
These optimized designs over Pt or Pt-based catalysts would be available
for FC utilizations commercially. However, some intermediates, especially
CO generated from EGORs, will poison the Pt-based catalysts and further
weaken their stability. Therefore, there still remains an enormous
challenge to study DAAFCs with a well-developed anode for the electrocatalytic
oxidation of liquid fuels actively, feasibly, and stably.19

Compared to the bulk counterpart, the
supporting strategy is actually a powerful profile to improve the
catalytic performances of the nanostructured Pt-based composites.20,21 In addition to typical oxide-type catalyst supports of titania,22 indium tin oxide,23 tin oxide,24 alumina,25 silica,26 and tungsten oxide,27 carbonaceous supports29 including graphene,30 conducting polymers,28 carbon nanotube,31 and nanoporous carbon32 have been proved
to be a kind of effective and compatible ones for the Pt/Pt-based
nanostructured catalysts based on intensive investigations. Generally,
the synthesis of these supported metal catalysts commonly involves
multistep processes of preparing initial protected Pt/Pt-based nanoparticles
(NPs), loading on appropriate supports mechanically and activating
the NPs to expose active sites.33−35 The procedure is complicated in general and the catalytic activity
fades out commonly because of the loss of active components from the
supports in catalysis process. As a comparison, a one-pot in situ
preparation of metal NPs directly dispersed on the catalyst support
of conductive carbon would be much more convenient and powerful to
optimize the electrocatalysts probably with self-sustained nanostructures
possessing an improved functionality and performance. Furthermore,
a supported carbon would limit the detachment, migration, and agglomeration
of these active metallic NPs, thus enhancing the durability of catalysts
in FCs.36,37 However, the catalytic performance may be
lowered when the catalyst is covered with a very thick carbon shell.
Therefore, it will be very important and challenging to appropriately
limit the size of the active nanostructures and acquire a thin carbon
conductive shell for improving the activity and durability of the
catalyst.

To achieve this goal, in the present work, we develop
a mild and facile profile for the synthesis of very small sized Pt
NPs that would be in situ embedded in conductive three-dimensional
(3D) spherical porous carbon (shortened as the 3D Pt/C composite)
generated in the synthetic process. Compared to the commercial catalyst
of Pt black, the 3D Pt/C composite demonstrates well-improved electrocatalytic
performance for EGORs as well as for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR)
and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR).

The 3D Pt/C composite
electrocatalyst was readily prepared in the route, as schematically
depicted in Scheme 1. Typically, the first synthesized precursor of the uniform spheres
was annealed to transform into an in situ formed 3D Pt/C composite
catalyst.

2 Results and
Discussion
The 3D Pt/C composite fabricated in the current
synthetic process has been identified by powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD). It is found that there are four major diffraction peaks of
the 3D Pt/C composite located at 40.10°, 46.49°, 67.78°,
and 81.44° (2θ) that can be well indexed to the facets
of face-centered cubic (fcc) Pt (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively
(JCPDS 00-001-1194), as displayed in Figure 1a. The Pt nanocrystals (NCs) in the 3D Pt/C
composite have an average grain size (about 4.0 nm) according to the
calculation of (111) plane diffraction over Scherrer’s equation.
The chemical states and compositions of the 3D Pt/C composite were
determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the survey
spectrum, only Pt, C, and O are obviously observed while the N signal
is not so clear to be detected in the spectrum (Figure S1a). In the Pt close-up spectrum (Figure 1b), two distinct peaks of 4f7/2 (71.6 eV) and 4f5/2 (74.9 eV) for Pt(0) can
be well indexed.38 The broadened and intensive
binding energy centered at ∼284.8 eV is attributed to graphite-like
carbon in addition to contaminant carbon (Figure S1b). The existence of O (Figure S1c) is commonly resulted from oxygen adsorption onto the sample, whereas
the N signal is relatively weak as seen in the close-up spectrum (Figure S1d). The
N 1s signal is detected to be oxidized N (405.5 eV and 402.2 eV) in
addition to chemical states of graphitic N (401.0 eV) can be pyrrolic
N (399.5 eV) and pyridinic N (398.3 eV).20 The investigations manifest that the fabricated composite is composed
of fcc Pt NCs embedded in carbon with trace nitrogen. However, Raman
spectrum (Figure 1c)
suggests that the generated carbon is not well crystallized in the
sample because the vibration at 1343 cm–1 (D-band)
is so intense as compared to that at 1597 cm–1 (G-band).39 Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 1d, the typical overall Pt loading in the
product was determined by air atmosphere thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and the specific value was 45.54%. XRD detection shows that
only pure Pt remained in the sample after the air atmosphere TGA (Figure S2), and it is a convincing detection
of Pt content via TGA.

Figure 1 Fabricated 3D Pt/C composite: XRD pattern (a),
close-up XPS spectrum for Pt 4f (b), Raman spectrum (c), and air atmosphere
TGA profile (d).

The fabricated 3D Pt/C sample was also
studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM), and selected area
electron diffraction (SAED). From Figures 2a and S3, it is
observed that the 3D Pt/C composite is composed of uniform nanostructured
spheres and their average size is ∼206.8 nm, as appeared in
the corresponding size distribution histogram (Figure S4). Both low- and high-magnification TEM images confirm
that the 3D Pt/C composite has uniform nanospheres which are composed
of numerous minute Pt NPs dispersed well in the spherical carbon matrix
without any obvious aggregation (Figure 2b–e). In detail, as seen in Figures 2d and S5, the Pt NPs are approximately 4.4 nm in size
(Figure 2d), which
agreed to the calculated data from Scherrer’s equation over
XRD detection (Figure 1a), and the shell thickness of carbon matrix/coating is approximately
1.66 nm (Figure 2e).
In the HR-TEM image (Figure 2f), an interfringe distance of 2.25 Å is observed, close
to d-spacing of the (111) lattice plane in metallic
Pt NCs. The corresponding SAED pattern further confirmed the structure
of the polycrystalline Pt NPs in the composite (inset in Figure 2f). Meanwhile, a
high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM) image of the 3D Pt/C composite (Figure 2g) and its corresponding elemental mappings
including electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mappings (Figure 2h) and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Figure 2i) were performed in the work. The C element (red in Figure 2h) in addition to
Pt (Figure 2i) is uniformly
distributed in the whole spherical sample (Figure S6) with different densities. Both C and Pt mappings are close
to detection by TEM (Figure 2b–f). These results reveal that ultrathin carbon coating
and homogenous carbon are distributed within the 3D Pt/C composite,
which can prevent the immigration and agglomeration of the Pt NPs
generated in the preparation and annealing treatment. The microstructure
of the 3D Pt/C composite is revealed by using N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm. From isotherm plot, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface is calculated to be as high as 139.342 m2 g–1. Meanwhile, the total pore volume of the composite
is determined to be about 0.1788 cm3 g–1 and the micropore volume is 0.067 cm3 g–1. It is detected that the 3D Pt/C composite shows microporous and
mesoporous feature with 5.133 nm in average pore diameter (Figure S7). The 3D Pt/C composite with relatively
high surface area in addition to the manifold pore diameter would
be favorable for the enhancement of electrocatalytic performance since
the electrolyte can penetrate completely into the pores, leading to
a higher electrode/electrolyte contact area.40

Pt of the as-synthesized 3D Pt/C composite.

In the present synthetic protocol, the 3D Pt/C composite is
pyrolytically derived from a complex precursor of highly uniform nanospheres
prepared hydrothermally in the media of deionized water with toluene
(PhCH3). As seen in SEM image (Figure S8a), the spheres of the complex precursor are of highly uniform
and monodisperse (∼269.0 nm) calculated from the corresponding
size distribution histogram (Figure S8b). Low- and high-magnified TEM images confirmed the complex precursor
spheres in high quality (Figure S8c,d).
The diameter of the precursor spheres is nearly 30% larger compared
to the annealed 3D Pt/C composite, demonstrating that an obvious shrinkage
occurs during the annealing process.40 XRD
detection suggests that the complex precursor spheres are not well
crystallized in the hydrothermal process because there are only some
very weak diffraction peaks observed in the range of 30°–65°
(2θ) in the pattern (Figure S9a)
due to a very small amount of Pt(0) nanocrystallites and possible
oxide impurity produced in very small size mixed with the organic
complex (Figure S9b). In the XPS spectra
of the spherical precursor (Figure S10),
elemental Pt, C, N, O, and Cl species are easily revealed, and the
oxidation state of Pt is mainly Pt(II) species besides a very small
percentage of Pt(0). Compared with the complex precursor (Figure S8), the elements of N and Cl in the annealed
sample are not easily observed in the survey XPS spectrum (red circles
in Figure S1a) due to the flow of Ar/H2 even though there is trace N doped in the 3D Pt/C composite
in high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (Figure S1d). In addition, it is found that there are only monodispersed Pt
NPs obtained without addition of 4-nitrophenol in the synthetic system
(Figure S11), which suggests that the employment
of 4-nitrophenol plays an important role in the formation of the spherical
precursor complex (Figures S8 and S9).
To obtain the 3D Pt/C composite with well-dispersed Pt NPs, we try
to prolong the reaction time (up to 20 h), and it is found that there
are some more elemental Pt NCs detected in the product based on XPS,
XRD, and TEM determinations (Figures S12 and S13). It is concluded that long reaction time is favorable for the reduction
of Pt(II) species to Pt NCs kinetically in outer surface from the
spherically polymeric complex of Pt(II) source with 4-nitrophenol
(Figure S9).

The solvents could also
influence the morphologies of the products at the same time as they
are varied when the mixed solvent of H2O with toluene (PhCH3) was replaced completely by deionized H2O (removing
toluene) in the reaction system (Scheme 2). In detail, the product was identified
as Pt@4-nitrophenol core@shell nanostructures (Figure S14), in which the shells were determined to be 4-nitrophenol
by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Figure S15). When a mixture of toluene and water was served
as the solvent, the target product of spheres can be prepared using
an optimal proportion of toluene and water as 1:1. The morphology
is uniform and excellent enough for serving as the precursor in the
following annealing process. When some other organic solvents, for
instance, cyclohexane, chloroform, and ethanol, were introduced to
mix with water as solvents, however, we could not obtain the 3D Pt/C
composite except for core@shell structured or metal NPs with different
sizes (Figure S16). Experimental investigations
suggest that toluene with water was favorable for the formation of
the complex sample in spherical shapes probably because of an interaction
of the two-phase flow thermodynamically in the solvothermal process.41 In the current work, the two-phase system with
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic solvents of immiscible water and
toluene with the optimal given ratio tend to be a kind of microemulsions42 or a microemulsion-like situation at temperatures
higher than their boiling points under the solvothermal conditions
even though there are not any surfactants involved in the solvothermal
system. It is understood that the microemulsion-like situation would
be favorable for the formation of monodispersed and uniform spherical
precursors at elevated temperatures over boiling points as the mixtures
of toluene and water were served as the solvents in the present solvothermal
system because spherical geometry has a reduced surface energy at
the same time in thermodynamics. However, it is also noted that there
are still some small thin plate-like shapes found on the outside of
the spherical precursors, especially at early reaction stage, as seen
in the low- and high-magnified SEM images in Figure S17. The result suggests that the self-assembly spherical samples
generated in the present microemulsion-like situation induced by the
solvothermal treatment have still some difference (with less stability)
from those formed in a typical microemulsion with an assistance of
surfactant molecules forming a monolayer in interface between water
phase and toluene as oil phase.42

The electrocatalytic performance toward EGOR, MOR, and EOR was investigated
over the as-prepared 3D Pt/C composite. Typically, the oxidation of
the small-molecule liquid fuels (EG, methanol, or ethanol) was evaluated
in a standard three-electrode system using the same mole mass loaded
on working glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) in the media of 0.5 M KOH
with 0.5 M liquid fuels.43 The mass loading
of the electrocatalyst of the 3D Pt/C composite was kept fixed in
each trial (20 μg). In the current work, commercial Pt black
has been measured under the same conditions as reference for comparison
at the same time. The cyclic voltammograms
(CVs) were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in
0.5 M H2SO4 solution according to the literature
procedure,43 as demonstrated in Figure S18. The electrochemically active surface
area (ECSA) for the 3D Pt/C composite can be calculated to be 18.0
m2 gPt–1.44,45Figure 3a–c reveals
typical CV curves for small-molecule oxidations over both the 3D Pt/C
composite and Pt black according to typical measurements in DAAFCs.43 There are two anodic peaks recognized as the
features of the three reactions measured in the typical CV curves
during positive and negative sweeps. There are anodic peaks revealed
at approximately 0.06, 0.04, and 0.02V in the forward sweep, mainly
resulted from the generation of Pt–OH and Pt–O species
at electrode surface reacting with carbon-containing species like
CO and HCO–,7,43,46,47 from the oxidation of EG, CH3OH, and C2H5OH. As noted, the catalytic
performance of the electrocatalyst could be appraised by measuring
the intensity of the forward anodic oxidation peak. As illustrated
in Figure 3 and Table S1, it is clear that EGOR, MOR, and EOR
mass activities over the 3D Pt/C composite are 565, 426, and 485 mA
mgPt–1, respectively, which are 2.8,
6.1, and 5.3 times higher than that of commercial Pt black (199, 70,
and 92 mA mgPt–1). As a result, the 3D
Pt/C composite exhibited much higher activity compared to the representative
catalyst of commercial Pt black. However, it is noted that in common,
Pt and Pt-based catalysts are easily poisoned by the surface adsorption
of some carbonaceous intermediates especially from the generation
of CO due to alcohol oxidation. In the present investigation, it is
expected that the tolerance of the composite would be improved with
the presence of N-doping in the 3D Pt/C composite while we note that
the tolerance to the carbonaceous species has not been enhanced in
general due to the trace amount of N dopant. In general, the tolerance
of an electrocatalyst can be evaluated using a vital parameter, If/Ib, which is the
ratio of the forward anodic oxidation current density to the backward
cathodic current density.48 In the present
case, the If/Ib value for EGOR, MOR, and EOR is calculated to be 1.50, 1.79, 1.32
and 2.03, 2.93, 1.06 over the catalyst of the 3D Pt/C composite and
commercial Pt black, respectively, as seen in Table S2 and Figure 3a–c. In general, it is equivalent to Pt black even
though it would be improved in the next step by applying dense doping
of N component in addition to possible integration of a 3d metal that
would be more effective for improving the tolerance of Pt-based catalysts.49−53

oxidation to liquid fuels in the systems of 0.5 M KOH with 0.5 M EG
(a), 0.5 M CH3OH (b), 0.5 M C2H5OH
(c), and comparative mass activity (d).

Durability is another critically important
issue to assess a high-performance catalyst in electrochemical applications.
In this work, a chronoamperometric (CA) detection was further carried
out at −0.1 V for 4000 s. Compared with the measured result
over the commercial Pt black, it is clearly found that the CA current
density was well improved over the 3D Pt/C composite (Figure 4a,c,e). It exhibited that the
current density over the catalyst of commercial Pt black decayed rather
fast with respect to the 3D Pt/C composite. In addition, it is also
found that the 3D Pt/C composite did not show obvious decrease in
electrocatalytic activity after a 4000 s current–time test
(Figure 4b,d,f, Table S3). However, the catalyst of commercial
Pt black merely maintained 73.1, 48.8, and 29.3% of the primary mass
activities for EGOR, MOR, and EOR, respectively (Figure S19, Table S3), performed
under the same conditions. On the basis of above investigations, it
implies that the 3D Pt/C composite with 1.66 nm of the carbon coating
layer and even trace N-doping are still favorable for the enhancement
of the electrocatalytic property in addition to a long-term stability
in the performed systems, as the ultrathin carbon coating layer would
localize the Pt NPs within the composite firmly without any aggregation,
migration, and even drop off the carbon matrix besides the well dispersion
of Pt NPs themselves. As reported in literatures, when the nitrogen-doped
carbon nanomaterials are used as the support to load metal catalysts,
they can greatly enhance the catalytic performances for the electrocatalysts
toward alcohol oxidation process.20,49−56 The main reasons
can be summarized as follows: first, the nitrogen doping precursor
with amino- or nitro- group in the synthetic route can effectively
control the particle size of metal NPs with improved dispersibility
so that the metal catalyst per unit mass has a larger ECSA that will
be beneficial to exert the intrinsic catalytic activity of the metal
particles and optimize the initial catalytic potential. Second, the
nitrogen atom with large electron affinity is beneficial to enhance
the interaction between the support and the active metal. In such
a case, Ostwald ripening phenomenon is significantly reduced in the
electrocatalytic process, so that the composite catalyst has a more
stable structure that accordingly leads to the catalysis with stable
property and performance. Third, the abundant nitrogen in the composite
catalyst can promote the surface enrichment of −OH, which can
oxidize toxic species such as COads in the catalytic process
and further enhance the corresponding anti-poisoning ability. Fourth,
the nitrogen-doped carbon shell with thinner layers will contribute
more to the electrocatalytic performance via increasing the charge-transfer
rate from monodispersed metallic Pt core to the layer.49−56 In brief, the 3D Pt/C
composite with small Pt NPs supported by nitrogen-doped carbon is
expected to fully exert synergy between the various components.

3 Conclusions
In
conclusion, the efficient and facile strategy has been successfully
developed and performed for the in situ preparation of the uniform
porous spherical 3D Pt/C composite. Investigations reveal that the
composite has been well controlled with numerous minute Pt NPs that
are dispersed homogeneously in the monodisperse spherical carbon matrix
without any obvious aggregation. Meanwhile, the as-prepared composite
exhibits much better catalytic activity and stability for small-molecule
oxidations electrocatalytically in alkaline solution as compared to
the commercial catalyst of Pt black. The enhanced performance was
resulted from the highly dispersive Pt NPs with very small size, porous
structure, homogenous carbon distribution, the thin carbon shell,
and trace N dopant in the spherical composite. This efficient in situ
synthetic strategy would be available for the bulk fabrication of
the electrocatalysts with simplified procedures, and it is expected
that the present route would also be extended to some more highly
active carbon-supported catalysts with multiple components besides
the one as illustrated in the present work.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Materials
4-Nitrophenol, potassium
hydroxide, cyclohexane, chloroform, sulfuric acid, ethylene glycol,
toluene, hexane, and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Ltd., China. Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6) was purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Co., China. The commercial
Pt black catalyst was purchased from Alfa Aesar.

4.2 Synthesis of Materials
4.2.1 Synthesis of Uniform Spherical
Precursor
Typically, 94 μL of H2PtCl6 (0.077 mol L–1) was added into a beaker
with 5 mL of toluene. Under vigorous stirring, 0.3 g of 4-nitrophenol
dissolved in 5 mL of deionized water was mixed with it. After that,
the mixed solution was loaded into an autoclave and maintained at
150 °C for 10 h. After reaction, the sample was precipitated
by ethanol and centrifuged. Then, the sample of uniform spheres was
washed with ethanol and centrifuged repeatedly five times for the
subsequent production of 3D Pt/C composite catalyst.

4.2.2 Synthesis of the 3D Pt/C Composite
Catalyst
The as-prepared precursor of uniform spheres was
annealed under a gentle gas flow of Ar (95%) + H2 (5%)
at 600 °C for 30 min.

4.3 Characterization
The structure, microstructure,
and morphology of products were characterized by various analytic
techniques. In detail, SEM spectra were recorded on JSM-6700F and
TEM was carried out on a Hitachi H-7650.57 XRD was detected on a Philips X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer
using graphite-monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54182
Å).57 HAADF-STEM in addition to corresponding
EELS and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopic mapping analyses were
carried on a JEOL JEM-ARF200F TEM/STEM with a spherical aberration
corrector.57 XPS spectra were acquired
on an ESCALAB MK II using Mg Kα as the excitation source. Raman
spectra were determined on a LABRAM-HR spectrometer with a 514.5 nm
Ar+ laser.57 The weight percentage
of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen was characterized by elemental
analysis, which was carried out on EA, Elemental Vario EL cube over
Thermal Conductivity Detector. TGA was performed on a SDTQ600 (TA
Instruments) TG-DTA analyzer under the protection of nitrogen and

accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. NMR spectra were
measured on 400 MHz instruments with residue of CDCl3 as
the internal reference (7.26 ppm for 1H NMR).

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
All of the electrochemical measurements were measured in a three-electrode
system on an electrochemical work station (CHI660E, ChenHua, Shanghai,
China).57 Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl (in saturated
KCl solution) electrode were used as the counter electrode and the
reference electrode, respectively, and all of the potentials were
quoted with respect to the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode.57 For the measurement, a glassy carbon disk electrode
(3.0 mm in diameter) was used as the working electrode. In the preparation
of working electrode, the 3D Pt/C composite or reference catalyst
was first transferred onto the glassy carbon disk electrode (∼0.285
mg cm–2) according to a standard treatment. ECSA
were measured via integrating hydrogen adsorption charge on cyclic
voltammetry (CV) carried out in a potential range from −0.2
to 1.0 V (vs Ag/AgCl electrode) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. After the electrode was activated (20 cycles) in H2SO4 solution, a CV data for the ECSA was acquired.
Afterward, the electrode was transferred for the measurements of electrocatalytic
alcohol oxidation. CVs for EGOR, MOR, and EOR were carried out in
0.5 M EG + 0.5 M KOH (a), 0.5 M CH3OH + 0.5 M KOH (b),
0.5 M C2H5OH + 0.5 M KOH, respectively, in the
potential range from −1.0 to 0.4 V. All measurements were carried
out with a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 at room temperature.
