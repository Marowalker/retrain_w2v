Stable organic radicals
with switchable spin states have applications
in medicine, biology, and material science. An emerging class of such
spin-switchable radicals is based on dicyanomethyl radicals, which
are typically thermally and air-stable species that form weakly bonded
(closed-shell singlet) dimers at a lower temperature that rupture
into electron paramagnetic resonance-active diradicals at a higher
temperature. However, thus far, the study of these dicyanomethyl radicals
has focused on their solution-phase behavior. An understanding of
how chemical structure affects the solid-state spin switching behavior
for these radicals is unknown. Here, we examine the solid-state spin
crossover behavior of 6 monoradicals and 10 tethered diradicals and
demonstrate that these species also undergo spin switching in the
solid state. We find that the susceptibility for solid-state spin
switching for the intermolecular dimers is weakly correlated to the
solution-phase Gibbs free energies of dimerization, but no apparent
correlations are seen between the solution-state free energies for
the intramolecular dimerization and the solid-state behavior. Furthermore,
intramolecular diradical dimers have greatly enhanced temperature-responsive
behavior compared to their intermolecular counterparts. Crystalline
and amorphous powders of the same radicals feature similar spin switching
behavior, but the crystalline materials have slower bond-rupture kinetics
at higher temperatures, suggesting that solid-state packing effects
are an important kinetic consideration. An interesting feature of
these systems is that, upon cooling down to room temperature after
heating, some radicals remain trapped in the solids, indicating magnetic
bistability, while others partially or fully return to the diamagnetic
dimers. This work provides insights into how chemical structure affects
spin crossover in the solid state for this new class of air-stable
radicals, the knowledge of importance for the construction of dynamically
responsive solid-state materials, and organic spin crossover polymers.

Introduction
Organic radicals with
switchable spin states are emerging materials
with applications in turn-on magnetic resonance contrast reagents,
spintronics, dynamic covalent assemblies, and stimuli-responsive polymers
and plastics.1−5 Such spin-switchable materials undergo a change in spin state in
response to external stimuli or environmental cues. Switching between
the standard properties of closed-shell molecules to spin-unpaired
radicals leads to large changes in the optical, magnetic, and conductivity
properties of these materials with relatively mild external stimuli,
making this spin switching strategy an attractive one for the design
of stimuli-responsive materials.

A critical barrier toward the
development of such spin crossover
organic materials is the requirement for stable organic radicals that
can switch between spin states. Regrettably, most stable organic radicals
do not show such spin switching behavior. However, dicyanomethyl radicals
have recently been demonstrated as promising building blocks for such
spin-switchable materials because they are air- and thermally stable
species and can switch between weakly bonded closed-shell forms and
spin-unpaired forms.6−10 Furthermore, the strength of the spin–spin interaction can
be tuned by substituents.6 The nature of
the spin–spin interaction for these dicyanomethyl radicals
is typically a very weak sigma dimer (with a C–C distance >1.6
A) or an antiferromagnetically spin-coupled pi dimer. There are cases
of organic radicals investigated in the solid state;11−16 however, detailed studies of dicyanomethyl organic radicals have
been mostly limited to the solution phase.

To understand how
the structure affects spin crossover in the solid
state, here, we report a study of a family of dicyanomethyl monoradicals
and tethered diradicals using variable-temperature electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR), allowing the comparison of the solid-state behavior
of 6 monoradicals and 10 tethered diradicals (Figure 1) to their previously reported solution-phase
behavior.

ref (7)), and 4O dimers

samples in this work (bottom).

Results
and Discussion
All of the monoradicals and linked diradicals
(shown in Figure 1)
in this study exhibit
qualitatively similar temperature-responsive behavior in the solid
state. At low temperatures, either no EPR signal or a very small one
is observed. In all cases, an EPR signal grows in as the temperature
is increased. This increase in the EPR signal is accompanied by a
color change in the solid from typically a light powder to a darkly
colored one (see the movie in the Supporting Information (SI)). Except where noted, after a brief temperature equilibration
period, the EPR signal is stable. These features are consistent with
rupturing of the colorless sigma dimers into their colored diradical
forms as the temperature is increased, similar to their solution-phase
behavior.

Correlation between Solution-Phase Radical Dimerization Ka and Solid-State Radical Behavior
We were interested in whether there is a correlation between the
solution-phase equilibrium constants for the radicals and the corresponding
solid-state spin switching behavior. Intuitively, one expects radicals
with weaker bonding interactions in the solution phase to have a higher
susceptibility for solid-state spin crossover. To test this hypothesis,
we evaluated six monoradicals with varying para substituents (OMe,
Me, SMe, morpholine, CN, and 2,4,6-OMe) that have varying solution-phase Ka values for dimerization. Radicals featuring
donating substituents appended to the aryl ring have lower solution-phase Ka values for dimerization, while those with
withdrawing groups (e.g., CN) have a stronger interaction. A Hammett
plot of the σ+ of the para substituent vs the Ka shows a positive correlation.6

Indeed, a comparison of the solution-state Ka values vs the sample spin count observed at
398 K shows a negative correlation (see SI Figure S4). The 2,4,6-trimethoxy monoradical, which has the lowest
binding constant (1.9 × 105 M–1),
has the highest percentage of spins, while the p-cyano
derivative, which has the highest solution binding constant (1.8 ×
108 M–1), has the lowest percentage of
spins. In general, however, the spin count observed for the solid
monoradicals is orders of magnitude lower than the spin count observed
in solution from 3 to 5 mM measured at the same temperature.

For the intramolecular dimers, however, the spin count is about
2 orders of magnitude higher in the solid state than for the monoradicals,
and in some cases, it is higher than that observed for the same diradicals
in solution. For example (see Figure 2), 4O, 3P, and 4P show a greater spin count in the solid state than in solution at
all temperatures studied. However, for these intramolecular diradical
cases, there is no discernible correlation between the intramolecular Ka determined in solution and the solid-state
spin switching behavior. Indeed, in the solid state, the temperature-responsive
spin switching curves are all relatively similar, despite differences
in the solution Ka between these linked
diradicals. Given that the primary difference in these linked diradicals
is the linker length, which leads to large changes in solution-phase
entropy, this is perhaps not so surprising because in solution, the
diradical is free to sample conformational space, which is not the
case in the confined solid-state environment. Thus, the differences
are larger in the solution state for these tethered diradicals than
in the solid state.

Figure 2 Spin counts at various temperatures for ortho tethers
(A), para
tethers (B), and monoradicals (C) with fold increases from 298 to
398 K to the right of each.

Reversibility of Spin Crossover
A major difference
between solution-state and solid-state spin crossovers is the reversibility
of spin crossover. In solution, rapid equilibration ensures a Boltzmann
population of spin-paired and spin-unpaired species. Upon lowering
the temperature, radicals immediately return to the dimers. In contrast,
we find that in the solid state, some of the radicals show magnetic
bistability (e.g., stay trapped in the paramagnetic state) despite
lowering the temperature.

After performing variable-temperature
EPR on the ortho and para tethered diradicals, we evaluated the ability
of the samples to return back to their diamagnetic dimers upon cooling.
In solution, all compounds return completely to their starting equilibrium
spin concentration upon cooling and can be reversibly cycled. This
is not so in the solid state (see Figure 2). Some of the tethered diradicals tested
here in the solid state show increases in radical concentration at
elevated temperatures, but upon cooling, the radical concentrations
remained elevated for over 12 months of extended sitting under air
(evidenced by the after-heated pictures in Figure 1). Examples of this type include 2O, 4O, and 6P. Others (e.g., 2P, 3P, 5P, 5O) show a partial
return. In still other cases (e.g., 3O, 6O), we observed a nearly complete return to the starting radical concentration
upon cooling.

Difference between Crystalline and Amorphous
Materials
The samples tested in Figure 1 are amorphous powders. We asked the question
of whether there
would be a difference in the spin switching behavior if the samples
were crystalline solids. For two of the monoradicals, we obtained
sufficient quantities of X-ray quality single crystals of the materials
(see Figure 1) to perform
solid-state VT-EPR measurements. In these two cases, we compared the
temperature-responsive behavior of the amorphous powders compared
to that of the single crystals (see Figure 3). The most striking difference is that,
at higher temperatures, the crystalline compound shows further growth
in the EPR signal over time after our short-temperature equilibration
in the EPR cavity, while the amorphous samples do not show any further
increase in their EPR signal. Essentially, the compound does not reach
a quick equilibrium at elevated temperatures and the radical continues
to form slowly over time. In the case of the p-thiomethyl
monoradical, the further increase is substantial. Thus, the kinetics
of bond rupture appear to be altered by solid-state morphology, and
there appears to be a barrier for spin crossover in crystalline materials
not present in the amorphous solids.

Figure 3 Single-crystal EPR data at 400 K for 2,4,6-trimethoxy-
and p-thiomethyl-substituted dimers with amorphous
powder EPR
spectra for each compound below.

By analyzing the combined data (i.e., spin counts at various temperatures)
for all 16 compounds (Figure 2), some interesting trends were observed. Compounds 4O and 6O showed largest increases for those
diradicals substituted at the ortho position, while 3P and 5P show the largest increase in the spin count
for the para-substituted diradical series. Compound 2P is much less flexible than other compounds, and we hypothesize that
it behaves differently because of this. An alternative possibility
is that some of these diradicals form higher-order aggregates (dimer,
trimer, oligomer, etc.) in the solid state. In the nontethered series,
the donating ability of each substituent correlated well with the
fold increase in the amount from 398 to 298 K with the exception of
the morpholine substitute compound. As noted in our previous work,
the para-nitrogen-containing dicyanomethyl radicals can suffer decomposition
at elevated temperatures, and this also occurred in the solid state
for this radical.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
investigated the effect of structure on
the spin crossover behavior of a family of dicyanomethyl monoradicals
and linked diradicals. All radicals and diradicals show a 10- to 100-fold
increase in spin counts upon being heated, with the linked diradicals
being much more susceptible to spin crossover than the monoradicals.
For the monoradicals, the solution-state Ka correlates weakly with the solid-state spin switching behavior,
but there is no correlation for the linked dimers, which all show
similar behavior due to a reduction of the importance of conformational
entropy in the solid state. The kinetics of spin crossover differ
between crystalline samples and amorphous powders, suggesting the
importance of crystal packing and hinting at cooperative effects.
The reversibility of spin crossover varies greatly among the radical
structures, with some powders trapping the radicals generated upon
heating and showing magnetic bistability, while others showing either
partially or fully reversible behavior. These studies with discrete
well-defined radicals lay the groundwork for using these radicals
and diradicals as the building blocks for stimuli-responsive spin
crossover polymers and bulk materials.

Experimental Section
General
Procedure in the Preparation of Amorphous Powder Solid-State
EPR Experiments
All of the compounds in this paper, the 6
intermolecular dimers and the 10 tethered intramolecular dimers, were
all synthesized according to previous reports by our lab.6,7 At the time for each experiment, a fresh sample of each compound
was oxidized from the precursor −CH adduct to generate the
radical/dimer species. Upon workup for these oxidations, during solvent
removal of the purification step, freshly purified potassium chloride
salt was added to the mixture to make an even dispersion in the sample
tube. When all solvents were removed, the desired compounds were then
mixed with KCl salt and finely ground using a mortar and pestle. Compounds
were added to EPR tubes and then sealed under normal atmospheric conditions.
The ratio of KCl to compound in question was kept constant in all
samples for consistency. A known weight of oxidized compound contained
within the EPR window was calculated for spin count calculations.
After EPR experiments, all samples were saved and placed into vials
for future experiments because these compounds do not decompose over
time, as evidenced by investigating samples many months after initial
oxidation and EPR study. Compounds tested in the solid state can be
dissolved and analyzed in solution to yield the exact same data from
our previously published papers. This is also useful because it allows
a “reset” to the dimer after spin switching to the diradical
in the solid state, some of which is not reversible.

General Procedure
in the Preparation of Single-Crystal Solid-State
EPR Experiments
For the 2,4,6-trimethoxy- and thiomethyl-substituted
compounds, sufficient amounts of single crystals were formed to allow
for direct EPR characterization on the single crystals themselves.
Crystals were grown by slow evaporation of compounds dissolved in
toluene; this process occurred serendipitously over the course of
a few months after initial solution EPR experiments. Single crystals
were carefully added with a spatula to a 3 mm EPR tube, and the tube
was sealed under atmospheric conditions. For the longer kinetic scans
on the crystals, a built-in kinetics parameter on the instrument allowed
for scanning the sample over a long period of time at various time
increments while at the elevated temperature.

EPR Instrument Parameters
The following parameters
were used on the EPR instrument for variable-temperature acquisitions:
modulation frequency, 100 kHz; receiver gain, 50 dB; modulation amplitude,
0.5–1 G; time constant, 0.1 s; center field, 3330 G; sweep
width, 300 G; microwave attenuation, 20 dB; microwave power, 2 mW;
number of data points, 2048. For the determination of spin count,
a calibration curve was generated using a sample of TEMPO at various
concentrations.

Materials and Methods
Variable-Temperature EPR
Experiments
Variable-temperature
EPR studies were performed on all compounds, radicals and diradicals,
to elucidate the effect of temperature on the homolytic bond cleavage
to generate each, in the solid state. All compounds were investigated
in the solid state, with a portion of each sample, ranging from 5
to 10 mg, in a sealed quartz EPR tube. During experiments on the EPR
spectrometer, a spectrum was recorded at 10 K intervals after allowing
5 min for the sample to reach an equilibrated temperature. The temperature
range for each sample was from 298 to 418 K at minimum; some samples
were investigated at even higher temperatures up to 450 K. Follow-up
EPR scans were performed after the samples were cooled back to room
temperature to gauge the reversibility for each sample to return to
starting temperature radical concentrations.
