The development of
artificial nanosystems that mimic directional
water-collecting ability of evolved biological surfaces is eagerly
awaited. Here we report a new type of addressable water collection
that is induced by coupling both vapor gradients, like a road drawn,
and the temperature-tuned condensation in nanopores as step signals.
What distinguishes the motion described here from the motions reported
earlier is the fact that neither bulk liquid infiltration nor displacement
of droplet is required. Instead, the motion results from a scanned
water capture because of the temperature-dependent condensation command
acting on the vapor pressure gradient track originated by a droplet
without a bulk fluidic connection with a mesoporous film. This novel
working principle demands only a small-range surface temperature control,
which was entirely generated by a thermoelectric cell integrated to
the mesoporous substrates. The strategy opens the route to achieving
precise control over wetting location (from a few to hundreds of micrometers)
and hence over the direction of water collected by these widely employed
nanomaterials. Furthermore, as water is collected from condensation
into the pores, the system naturally involves purification and subsequent
delivery of clean water, which provides an added value to the proposed
strategy.

Introduction
Notable biological
surfaces on the micro- and nanometer scale,
in both plant and animal kingdoms, display special features that control
their interaction with water from humid air.1 A fascinating example is provided by certain beetles living in the
desert that can capture water from the fog on their backs.2 Cactus species can also harvest water from humid
air using exquisite multilevel surface structures.3 In addition to the adaptive characteristics that facilitate
efficient fog capture, these adapted species present directional water
collection as a notable ability of its biological structure. Mesoporous
materials, which are composed of humidity-sensitive nanopores, enjoy
a reputation as surfaces that collect water from humid air.4−6 Another interesting but less studied feature is the nanofluidic
ability of mesoporous thin films (MTFs) to transport water by a bulk
fluidic connection from drops deposited over its surface.7,8 Liquid from these sessile droplets infiltrates the porous matrix
via capillary imbibition and builds a defined wetted region with a
fluid front that advances in the mesoporous film.7 For instance, nanofluidic platforms based on MTF have been
used to implement localized chemical reactions,9 for nanoflow manipulation,10 as a fluid sensor,11 and, notably, as
an electrical current nanogenerator.12

Consider now a vapor gradient that influences a nanopore media.
The resulting variations in relative humidity create a pathway for
the directional collection of water. It is reasonable to expect that
decreasing the temperature of the MTF can cause water capture along
the pressure gradient. This scanned condensation of the water would
be an innovative method for the creation of novel systems able to
handle water uptake on the microscale. As proof of this concept, this
work demonstrates that decreasing the temperature of the condensing
surface drives a mobile wetting front onto the MTF guided from the
vapor gradient associated with an adjacent water drop, which is not
in direct contact with the patterned MTF. Given that water uptake
produces a directional expansion of the wetted area, MTF exhibits
an addressable water-collecting capability that is comparable to that
found in evolved biological systems. A remarkable plus of the strategy
is that it works under room conditions, which offers advantages in
the development of practical devices. We further demonstrate the possibility
to obtain and deliver purified water to micro-size nano-confined domains
in a well-controlled fashion.

Results and Discussion
Thick (≈130
nm) mesoporous silica thin films (≈10
nm pore size) prepared as reported previously7,9 were
patterned in defined millimeter-size shapes, using conventional photolithography
techniques.13 Details are given in the Experimental Section and the process is schematically
shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) images of the patterned
mesoporous films elucidate its structure (Figure 1). The system was operated in the lab atmosphere,
under controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity:
25 °C and 46%, respectively. The water adsorption isotherm shown
in Figure S2 (Supporting Information) reveals
that in these ambient conditions the pores remain principally empty.
The silicon substrate was then thermostated with a Peltier cell to
homogeneously tune the temperature on the mesoporous film when a voltage
is applied. When a water drop (2 μL) was placed around 50 μm
beside the patterned MTF onto the silica substrate, a localized condensation
region develops on the MTF surface. The wet area can be optically
observed because water uptake produces a refractive index contrast
in relation to the dry zone.

view of the MTF.

Figure 2 presents
a schematic representation of the mechanisms controlling water collection
through the mesoporous matrix. Water evaporation from the droplet
surface creates a microclimate of increased vapor pressure (p) in relation to the ambient vapor pressure (pa), as schematically shown in Figure 2a. An estimation of the pressure profile
can be made by using the classical description of droplet evaporation
for a given temperature and without convective flows, where vapor
distribution into the air is governed by molecular diffusion.14,15 From the characteristic diffusion time tD ≈ d2/D, where
the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air is D = 28 10–6 m2/s at 25 °C, for example,
the time for water molecules to diffuse a distance d ≈ 100 μm is less than 1 ms. According to this estimation,
one may consider a quasi-steady state of vapor pressure because the
diffusivity is practically instantaneous for small distances. In spherical
coordinates, around a symmetric droplet of radius, rdrop, one has: ∂(r2∂p/∂r)/∂r = 0, where r is the radial coordinate.16 The boundaries of this equation are the saturated
vapor pressure on the drop surface, psat = p(r = rdrop), and the ambient pressure at long distances, pa = p(r →
∞). A straightforward integration of the governing equation
yields 1  which describes pressure variation in the
radial outward direction of the surrounding air. Equivalently, a gradient
of relative humidity (RH = p/psat) develops around the droplet, which decreases from 100%
on the drop surface to 46% clear of the drop (room value).17,18 This microenvironment of enriched humidity spans over the patterned
MTF and induces water condensation into the mesoporous matrix (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 Scheme of the water-collecting
system. (A) Schematic representation
of vapor pressure contours around a sessile drop on a silicon substrate
(side view); the drop border is micrometers apart from a region of
patterned mesoporous film. The cooling plate of the thermoelectric
cell in direct contact with the substrate is also shown. (B) Zoom
of the mesoporous film in close vicinity of the drop border (side
view). The blue arrows indicate the condensation flux, which takes
place in the zone where the vapor pressure (p) is
higher than the condensation pressure (pa) at the nanopores. The black arrow is the radial coordinate (r) in the plane of the substrate, where rpb is the location of the patterning border and rwf is the position of the wetting front at a
given temperature.

Nanopore structures effectively
capture water from unsaturated
vapor, as the capillary pressure (Pcap) arising from small curvatures in the nanoscale confinement strongly
decreases the vapor pressure required for condensation (pc), in comparison to the condensation pressure on a flat
surface (psat).19 In fact, according to Kelvin–Laplace equation, the condensation
pressure can be written as20 2  where Vm is molar
volume of the liquid, R is the gas constant, and Tabs is the absolute temperature. It is worth
reminding that psat(T) is a well-known function for water,21 which increases from 2.34 to 5.63 kPa in the range 20–35
°C. On the other hand, the air in direct contact with the patterned
film has a decreasing vapor pressure, as shown in Figure 2b. Thus, water uptake into
the mesoporous film occurs in the close vicinity of the droplet border,
where p ≥ pc.
Beyond a certain radial distance, where the vapor pressure is lower
than pc, the film remains dry. At a given
temperature, the wetting front reaches a steady position (rwf), as shown in Figure 2b.

The series of pictures in Figure 3a display how the
wetted region grows as the substrate
temperature decreases (cooling from 30.6 to 21.4 °C in this example).
The dynamics of this directional water collection can be vividly observed
on the Movie S1 (Supporting Information) accelerated by a factor of about 4. As mentioned above, when MTF
was exposed to vapor gradient surrounding a droplet, water started
to condense selectively on the mesoporous film and the position of
the wetting front was displaced with relatively small temperature
variations. In this process, the nanopores serve as temperature-activated
condensing sites to be able to move the wetting front directionally.
Imbibition driven by capillary condensation in nanopores has been
recently demonstrated by theory and experiments,19 where vapor pressure was varied in a chamber at a given
temperature. However, as a novel approach, our strategy consists in
exploiting the natural vapor pressure gradient generated by water
droplets at room conditions, whereas condensation is induced by controlling
the surface temperature, thus additionally allowing localized and
directional water uptake. In what follows, we describe this effect
by using a qualitative analysis of the underlying phenomena of vapor
transport.

front along the mesoporous film during a gradual temperature diminution.
Scale bar = 50 μm. (B) Qualitative graph of the condensation
pressure as a function of film temperature according to eq 2. (C) Qualitative graph of the vapor
pressure as a function of radial distance, according to eq 1. The red arrow indicates the displacement
of the wetting front when the film temperature decreases. (D) Position
of the wetting front as a function of substrate temperature; the distance
was measured from the MTF patterning border, and corresponds to rwf(T) – d0, where the distance d0 is
about rpb (Figure 2b). The dashed line is to guide the eye (see Figure 4 for model prediction).
Substrate temperature was controlled with a thermoelectric cell, where
voltage varied from −1 to 2 V in steps of 0.02 V s–1. The inset shows the linear relation between the temperature measured
at the substrate surface and the input voltages.

The Kelvin–Laplace equation allows one to rationalize
the
thermal effect, taking into account that the condensation pressure
increases with temperature (see eq 2) because of the dependence of both psat(T) and the exponential factor (energy
associated with the curvature); the overall effect is depicted in Figure 3b. Therefore, directly
decreasing the film temperature enables condensation at lower vapor
pressures, that is, in the outer regions of the gradient, which produces
a displacement of the wetting front in the outward radial direction,
as illustrated in Figure 3c (see also eq 1). Furthermore, assuming that the wetting front is defined by the
condition p(rwf) ≈ pc(T), one may infer the existence
of an implicit function, rwf(T), connecting the diagrams of Figure 3b,c. Effectively, the function rwf(T) was experimentally measured and is reported
in Figure 3d, where
the dashed line is just to guide the eye. In what follows we explore
the theory for such correlation.

In fact, equalizing eqs 1 and 2 yields 3  where the pressure values taken at
25 °C
come from eq 1 and correspond
to the vapor pressure in the air, which is supposed to be kept at
ambient conditions during the experiments, as a first approximation.
Also in eq 3, the capillary
pressure has been included as Pcap = 2σ/rp, where rp is the
average pore radius and σ is the water surface tension (this
parameter slightly varies with temperature and may also be considered
constant in the range 20–35 °C).

In order to compare
the model prediction against experimental data,
it should be taken into consideration that the distance plotted in Figure 3d is d(T) = rwf(T) – d0, where d0 is an arbitrary constant that measures the initial position
of the wetting front during image analysis. Here we left d0 as a free parameter, together with the drop radius, rdrop, that enters eq 3, which is also an effective value considering
the oversimplifications made to derive eq 1. Finally, the comparison is made in Figure 4, where it is readily seen that the theoretical prediction
closely follows the experimental trend. It is worth to remark that
the model includes all the characteristic constants of water (reported
in the caption of Figure 4) and the average pore radius of the mesoporous film, rp = 5 nm. The only fitting parameters were rdrop = 220 μm and d0 = 175 μm, whose values are quite reasonable for the
experimental set.

Figure 4 Theoretical background for the working principle. Wetting-front
position as a function of temperature, for different pore radius.
The distance plotted is d = rwf(T) – d0, where rwf(T) is included
from eq 3. Parameter
values used in calculations are: σ = 73 mN m–1, Vm = 18 mL, R = 8.314
J mol–1 K–1, psat(25) = 3.17 kPa, and pa(25) = 0.46psat(25). The function psat(T) was included as a correlation
for the range 20–35 °C.21 Fitting
parameters are rdrop = 220 μm and d0 = 175 μm (see text for details).

In Figure 4, the
dashed lines correspond to smaller and larger pore radius (3 and 10
nm, respectively), for the same rdrop and d0 values. These curves illustrate the response
of the system for mesoporous films with different pore size. For example,
for a given temperature, smaller pore radius yields larger wetting
fronts, which is because smaller radius increases capillary condensation,
and thus, the system may capture water at relatively lower vapor pressures.
Therefore, one may observe that eq 3 establishes a strong correlation between the wetting-front
position and the surface temperature, which is fully based on physical
parameters of the system.

The practical interest of this correlation
is that the position
of the wetting front can be handled by controlling the mesoporous
film temperature, which is carried out by using a Peltier cooling
system in our experiments. Liquid flow because of capillary action
may also play a role, driving water from wet to dry zones into the
film; however, the infiltration dynamics through the nanopore structure
is very slow in comparison to condensation,19 whereas here the wetting front instantaneously followed the temperature
changes. At this point, it is worth emphasizing that the film becomes
wetted without a bulk fluidic connection with the droplet, in contrast
to previous setups where MTF were infiltrated from liquid reservoirs.10

Considering a top view of the water-uptake
phenomenon, such as
in Figure 3a and Movie S1, it is readily seen how the 2D shape
of the wetting front closely follows the isobar lines of the vapor
pressure gradient. For a given film temperature, condensation occurs
at radial positions r ≤ rwf, where p(r) ≤ pc(T). Decreasing the film temperature
produces an expansion of the wetted area, and the advance of the wetting
front resembles a scanning of the peripheral isobars in the plane
of the substrate. The effect is clearly observed because optical reflectance
locally changes upon water saturation, providing a net contrast between
wet and dry zones of the film.7 Furthermore,
it has been recently shown that the relationship between the amount
of adsorbed water and light reflectance is rather linear.19 Control experiments performed in droplet absence
showed no directional water collection (see Figure S3; Supporting Information), reinforcing the hypothesis
that both components of the system (mesoporous matrix and water reservoir
in noncontact mode) are necessary to produce an addressable water-uptake
location.

In order to test the potential utility of the addressable
nanocondensator
to collect and deliver purified water, we conducted chemical reaction
experiments on patterned MTF, in which reagents were supplied from
sessile droplets. Two differing configurations were tested: droplets
directly in contact with the MTF and droplets adjacent to the patterned
region without fluidic contact with the MTF. Figure 5a shows the localized formation of AgCl(s)when droplets of 0.1 M silver nitrate (AgNO3)
and 1 M sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions are deposited over the opposite
borders of a rectangular (1.2 mm × 2.4 mm) MTF patterning.9 Wetted regions grew from both drops via capillary
imbibition, and the transported reagents produced an abrupt precipitation
of silver chloride in the contact interface.9 In contrast, no precipitation was observed when droplets were not
in touch with the MTF patterning (Figure 5b). This expected result makes evident the
distillated nature of the collected water and simultaneously reveals
an attractive strategy for malleable water purification on the microscale,
further suggesting the potential to integrate this controlled supply
of clean water into advanced microdevices. Although it can be argued
that the instability of MTFs in aqueous media represents a liability
of this system for long-term applications,22 our experiments show that they are usable at least within a reasonable
time frame.

Figure 5 Purified water collector. Optical microscopy images of the region
where the wetting fronts from different drops met. Drops of 0.1 M
AgNO3 and 1 M NaCl solutions were deposited in opposite
sides of a patterned MTF with (A) or without (B) direct connection
to the film. In both cases, the lower panels show the final stage
(after decreasing temperature): as expected, silver chloride precipitation
takes place only if there is a bulk fluidic connection between the
drops and the MTF. Scale bar = 50 μm.

Conclusions
The development of systems that operate on “open
pit”
scenarios to provide addressable water collection, which is intrinsic
to evolved natural systems, is becoming a key requirement for versatile
devices, presenting a significant scientific and engineering challenge.
Whereas studies of water collection into pore media in the past used
pressure chambers at a given temperature, we have here explored the
surface temperature–actuated condensation in a natural vapor
gradient guide generated by water droplets under room conditions as
the driving forces. Water-collecting directionality in the mesoporous
films is the result of the condensation features tuned by surface
cooling on drop vapor environment at ambient conditions. We have demonstrated
that mesoporous films not only yield water condensation but also enable
a directional water collection from the humidity of small droplets
through relatively small MTF temperature variations. The temperature
control has been established by voltage inputs, which offer additional
opportunities for the development of microdevices with integrated
smart water collection capabilities. Unlike the nanofluidic platforms
based on capillary infiltration reported at present, in this noncontact
mode the motion of the wetting front is fully driven by water uptake
from the vapor phase. This strategy takes advantage of coupling both
the vapor gradient around sessile drops, like road drawn, and the
temperature-dependent condensation pressure in nanopores as step signals.
We anticipate that this route can be extended readily to other nanoporous
structures (nanostructured porous silicon,23 metal–organic frameworks,24 and
so forth) to guide their water uptake. This new working principle
opens the way for nanopore networks to be used as an accurately controllable
wetting location versatile system and hence to direct the water collection.
We therefore envision that this study will aid the development of
novel addressable systems for water collection and purification. Owing
to its high modularity and scalability, this self-purifying water
supply may find applications in advanced microdevices.

Experimental
Section
Silicon wafers ⟨1 0 0⟩ were cleaned
with Milli-Q
water, acetone, and isopropanol, and dried under nitrogen flow. The
pattern to be transferred was defined by a conventional lithography
technique. The fabrication starts with the spinning of a sacrificial
AZ 2070 resin layer at 3000 rpm (thickness 7 μm) on which UV
lithography was performed for 10 s, and then developed. A 200 nm copper
film was then deposited by sputtering with a subsequent lift-off with
acetone. For the mesoporous film deposition step, the copper-patterned
substrate was submerged in a silica precursor solution. Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the inorganic precursor,
and Pluronics F127 (HO(CH2CH2O)106(CH2CH(CH3)O)70–(CH2CH2O)106OH) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the
template. TEOS was prehydrolyzed by refluxing for 1 h in an acidic
water (HCl 0.14 M) and ethanol (EtOH) solution in the following ratios:
[H2O]/[Si] = 1; [EtOH]/[TEOS] = 5. Next, Pluronics F127,
ethanol, and acidic water (HCl 0.055 M) were added to the prehydrolyzed
solution in order to prepare the precursor solution with final composition
TEOS/EtOH/H2O/F127 equal to 1:40:5:0.0075 mol ratio. Mesoporous
silica films were deposited by dip-coating at 2 mm/s at RH of 35%.
After deposition, the samples were placed in a 50% RH chamber overnight,
and then subjected to a consolidation thermal treatment, consisting
of 1 h at 60 °C, 1 h at 130 °C, and calcined at 350 °C
for 2 h (temperature ramp: 1 °C/min) to remove the templating
agent. Finally, the samples were submerged in a wet etching solution,
which is selective to the cooper layer comprised of HCl/H2O2/H2O in a 1:1:5 ratio for 30 min at 60 °C.
Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows
a schematic diagram of these fabrication steps to obtain the patterned
mesoporous films.

Micrographs were obtained using a Zeiss LEO
982 Gemini field-emission
electron microscope in the secondary electron mode, using an in-lens
detector to improve resolution.

In order to control substrate
temperature, it was brought into
contact with a thermoelectric cell (SF-COM-10080, SparkFun Electronics)
connected to an I–V source
measure unit Keithley 2612A, and temperature values were acquired
with a resistance temperature detector (Pt100) in contact with the
sample. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C of room temperature
and 46% RH by placing 2 μL drops. The cooling plate was in close
contact with the silicon substrate, and no thermal gradients were
observed in the region of interest. Images were recorded using a Mitutoyo
FS70 microscope with a high-resolution digital camera.
