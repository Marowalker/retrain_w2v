Fully alloyed metallic nanomaterials have attracted much attention
because of the superior chemical and physical properties to their
single components. However, it has been difficult to make fully alloyed
anisotropic nanostructures due to the required high energy input.
Here we present the preparation of fully alloyed AuAg nanorods by
using a photothermal nano-oven, in which Au@Ag nanorods can convert
absorbed light to thermal energy while the silica shell can act as
both the thermal insulator and protective layer to facilitate the
alloying process. The as-prepared AuAg nanorods showed enhanced plasmonic
property stemming from silver and much higher chemical stability in
a corrosive environment derived from gold. This method opens up a
new approach for the preparation of plasmonic nanostructures with
desired properties.

Introduction
Over the past 2 decades, metallic alloy nanoparticles have attracted
much attention because of the superior physical and chemical properties
to their corresponding single components.1−7 With the advanced synthetic methods, various bimetallic and multimetallic
alloy nanoparticles have been prepared.8−12 However, it has been gradually realized that most of the reported
alloy nanoparticles are not fully alloyed and the ratio of different
components varied from one domain to another.13−15 The resulted inhomogeneous nanoparticles
are therefore suffering from the disadvantages of each single component.
For instance, inhomogeneous Au/Ag alloy nanoparticles can be etched
from the unstable Ag domain, leading to the reduced surface plasmon
resonance (SPR) properties.13 It has been
pointed out recently that fully alloyed metallic nanoparticles can
possess the advantageous properties of each metal element and show
superior properties to their original components. For example, Huang
and co-workers prepared fully alloyed PdCu-based nanoparticles by
annealing those particles at 375 °C for 1 h. The as-prepared
ordered nanoparticles showed better catalytic performance and higher
stability than their corresponding disordered counterparts.16 Gao and Yin prepared fully alloyed Au/Ag nanospheres
by thermally annealing Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles at a high
temperature (1000 °C), which showed comparable SPR property to
pure silver and significantly improved chemical stability.13 To improve the compositional homogeneity of
multicomponent nanoparticles, a number of methods have been developed,
such as high-temperature annealing,17−20 ultrasonic treatment,21 and laser irradiation.22,23 Although
much progress has been achieved, some challenges still remain. For
instance, although both Yin group24 and
van Blaaderen group25 prepared alloyed
AuAg nanorods (NRs), it is still quite difficult to prepare fully
alloyed anisotropic nanostructures in an efficient and cost-effective
manner because high energy input is usually required, which destroys
the original morphology and produces spherical or irregular nanoparticles
with minimized surface energy. It is therefore highly desired to develop
new methods that can make fully alloyed nanoparticles with well-defined
morphology and outstanding physiochemical properties.

Plasmonic
nanoparticles, especially Au and Ag, have been widely used in diverse
fields, such as photothermal therapy and water distilling, because
of their strong photothermal effect.26−30 It has been demonstrated that such metal nanoparticles can be melted
under laser irradiation.22 Inspired by
this phenomenon, here we present a photothermal “nano-oven”
that can fully alloy AuAg NRs and maintain their anisotropic nanostructure.
The photothermal nano-oven is composed of an Au@Ag core–shell
NR and a silica shell. Because the silica shell is almost transparent
in the visible light range, the inner Au@Ag NRs can absorb light and
convert it to thermal energy. Upon irradiation, the surface temperature
of metal nanoparticles increases sharply because of their strong photothermal
effect and the low thermal conductivity of silica shell and air. The
presence of a silica shell can further prevent the agglomeration of
metal nanoparticles and help to maintain the anisotropic shape. After
irradiation, fully alloyed monodisperse AuAg NRs with great plasmonic
property and enhanced chemical stability can be obtained.

Results and Discussion
The whole process
is illustrated in Figure 1a. Monodisperse Au NRs with an aspect ratio of ca. 3.6 (with
an average length of 102 nm and diameter of 28 nm) were first prepared
through a seed-mediated growth process (Figure S1a in Supporting Information).31 A layer of silver was then deposited on the surface of Au NRs to
form a uniform Au@Ag core–shell nanostructure (Figure 1b) at 65 °C by using ascorbic
acid (AA) as the reducing agent and AgNO3 as the silver
source.32,33 The samples with different silver amounts
were denoted as Au@Ag NRs-5, -2.5, 1.2 when the molar ratio of Au/Ag
is 5, 2.5, and 1.2, respectively. In case of Au@Ag NRs-2.5, a decrease
in aspect ratio (to 3.2) and an increase of NR size (with an average
length of 108 nm and diameter of 34 nm) due to the epitaxial growth
of Ag shell can be clearly observed. The thickness of Ag shell at
the end of Au NRs is obviously smaller than that on the long side,
which may be caused by the non-uniform anchoring of hexadecyltrimethylammonium
chloride (CTAC) micelle.34 The core–shell
nanostructures have been further confirmed by the energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping analysis (Figure 1c). By using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) as the directing agent, concentric Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles
with an ordered mesoporous SiO2 shell (∼40 nm in
thickness) have been obtained, as shown in Figure S1b. To prevent the potential etching of Ag layer by ammonia
hydroxide, the silica-coating process was finished within 45 min.
The as-obtained Au@Ag@SiO2 nanostructures were then dried
on a quartz plate and irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp under an
N2 atmosphere, as illustrated in Figure S2. Fully alloyed AuAg NRs could be obtained after removing
silica shell in a concentrated HF solution. As shown in Figure 1d, the AuAg alloy NRs have
an aspect ratio of ca. 3.2, which is consistent with that of the original
Au@Ag NRs, indicating the well-maintained anisotropic nanostructure.
EDX mapping (Figure 1e) further revealed a homogeneous distribution of Au and Ag atoms,
confirming the formation of fully alloyed and well-defined AuAg NRs.
It is worth pointing out that the sharp corners at the end of AuAg
alloy NRs became rounded (Figure 1d). The spatial distribution of electric field intensity
is different in anisotropic nanocrystals, such as Au NRs, Au bipyramids,
Au triangles, and even bimetallic nanocrystals.35−37 In these structures, the local field enhancement
of the ends or apexes is higher than that of sides. Therefore, the
photothermal effect at the ends of NRs is much stronger, leading to
higher temperature and the reshaped ends of NRs under irradiation.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic illustration of the formation
of fully alloyed AuAg NRs using a photothermal nano-oven; (b,d) TEM
images of original Au@Ag NRs-2.5 and fully alloyed AuAg NRs-2.5; and
(c,e) corresponding EDX elemental mapping of original Au@Ag NRs-2.5
and fully alloyed AuAg NRs-2.5.

The alloying process has been confirmed by the UV–vis spectroscopy
study. Figure 2 clearly
shows the UV–vis spectra of different samples. The original
Au NRs showed two extinction peaks centered at 830 and 510 nm, corresponding
to the longitudinal and transverse SPR (LSPR and TSPR), respectively.38 The sharp ensemble peak and narrow full width
at half maximum (150 nm) illustrate the narrow size distribution of
Au NRs. To investigate the feasibility of our method in preparing
AuAg alloy NRs with different Au/Ag ratios, Au@Ag core–shell
NRs with different thicknesses of Ag shell were prepared by tuning
the addition amount of AgNO3 [transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images are presented in Figures 1b and S3]. The obtained
products were denoted as Au@Ag NRs-5, -2.5, and -1.2, representing
the different ratios of Au/Ag. In accordance with previous reports,39 coating Au NRs with a shell of Ag could lead
to a blue shift of both the longitudinal and transverse plasmon band.
As shown in Figure 2a–c, the LSPR peak shifted from 830 to 785, 778, and 750 nm,
when the Au/Ag ratio changed to 5, 2.5, and 1.2, respectively. There
is also a slight shift in the TSPR peak, as shown in Figure 2a–c. It is worth pointing
out that the growth of Ag shell significantly increased the extinction
intensity (as shown in Figure S4), which
can be ascribed to the higher extinction efficiency of Ag than that
of Au.40,41 Alloying the Au@Ag core–shell nanostructure
led to a further blue shift of the extinction peak. As depicted in Figure 2a, when the Ag shell
is very thin (the ratio of Au/Ag is 5), the fully alloyed AuAg NRs
have a sharp LSPR peak at 775 nm. When the ratio of Au/Ag decreased
to 2.5 and 1.2, the LSPR peak shifted to 705 and 660 nm, respectively,
suggesting the high sensitivity of plasmonic nanoparticles to their
chemical composition. As a result, the plasmonic property of fully
alloyed AuAg NRs could be easily tuned by varying the chemical composition
of original Au@Ag core–shell nanostructures.

NRs-2.5, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 °C.

To investigate
the alloying mechanism, the alloying process has been studied carefully.
It is found that the presence of silica shell played a critical role
in the alloying process. In the absence of silica shell, one can obtain
only a black product that cannot be dispersed in water or ethanol,
which might be attributed to the decomposition of surfactants and
the resulted severe aggregation of nanostructures. To figure out whether
the fully alloyed AuAg NRs could be obtained through a thermal annealing
process, the as-prepared Au@Ag@SiO2 nanostructures have
been thermally annealed at different temperatures for a designed time.
We take the Au@Ag NRs-2.5 as the example. As shown in Figure 2d, the LSPR peak of original
Au@Ag NRs-2.5 is 778 nm. When the sample was heated at 200 and 400
°C for 24 h, the LSPR peak blue-shifted slightly to 763 and 752
nm, respectively, suggesting that 200 and 400 °C are not high
enough to ensure the fully alloying of Au–Ag. The inhomogeneous
alloyed AuAg NRs show poor stability against chemical etching (as
shown in Figures S5, S6a,b). Further increasing
the heating temperature to 600 °C, the LSPR peak-shifted to ∼700
nm, which is very close to the photothermally treated sample (Figure 2b). However, the
TEM characterization shows that the inhomogeneous product can be obtained.
As shown in Figure S6c,d, some irregular
shaped nanoparticles have been obtained, which might be ascribed to
the melting of NRs. At the same time, some core–shell nanostructures
can be observed, implying inhomogeneous alloying process. Although
the melting temperatures for bulk Au and Ag are 1064 and 962 °C,
respectively, these nanoparticles can be melted at a much lower temperature
because of the well-known “melting-point depression”
phenomenon.42−44 When
the samples were treated at higher temperatures, such as 800 and 1000
°C, the reshaping effect became more profound. As shown in Figure S6e, irregular shaped Au nanoparticles
can be obtained after being treated at 800 °C for 2 h. The LSPR
peak blue-shifted to ∼620 nm. Only spherical particles can
be obtained when the Au@Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles were annealed
at 1000 °C for 2 h (Figure S6f), suggesting
that the physical confining effect of silica cannot work at that temperature.
The LSPR peak blue-shifted to ∼480 nm, which can be attributed
to the fully alloying of Au–Ag as well as the spherical shape.
Compared to the thermal annealing method reported by both Yin group24 and van Blaaderen group,25 the difference may come from the thickness and property
of silica shell. van Blaaderen and co-workers employed mesoporous
SiO2 with a thickness of ∼15 nm, which exhibited
excellent thermal-transfer efficiency due to the unique mesoporous
structure, while SiO2 shell with a thickness of ∼100
nm served as the protective layer for the inner core–shell
structure and prohibited the shrinkage of NRs into spheres in Yin’s
report. In our procedure, we found that suitable thickness of silica
is critical. When the silica layer was too thick (>50 nm), the
light conversion efficiency was too low to achieve fully alloying.
On the other hand, if the silica layer was too thin (<20 nm), some
irregular shaped nanoparticles were obtained. Compared to the reported
results, our products show the highest ratio of LSPR/TSPR, indicating
higher uniformity of the final product.

In this photothermal
approach, although the temperature detected by the thermocouple was
only about 254 °C, fully alloying has been achieved, which might
be attributed to the thermal insulating effect of silica shell. It
is well known that Au and Ag are good thermal conductors with thermal
conductivities of 315 and 427 W m–1 K–1, respectively, at 300 K and 1 atm.45−47 Amorphous silica is a good thermal insulator with
a very low thermal conductivity (∼1.34 W m–1 K–1 at 300 K and 1 atm).47,48 On
the basis of the above mentioned results, we can propose a possible
mechanism for the successful alloying of AuAg NRs. Because the silica
shell is almost transparent to visible light, Au and Ag components
can absorb light under irradiation and converted it to thermal energy.
Because of the low thermal conductivity of air and silica, the Au@Ag@SiO2 nanostructure worked as a “nano-oven”, in which
the temperature increased dramatically and finally reached a temperature
close to the melting temperature of Au@Ag NRs. If the NRs were melted,
the photothermal effect will be reduced because the absorption of
light is reduced significantly. As a result, the highest temperature
should be lower than the melting temperature. At that temperature,
the interdiffusion of Au and Ag atoms was accelerated. After maintaining
at the temperature for enough time, fully alloyed AuAg NRs can be
obtained. To figure out the temperature inside the silica shell, in
situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed with Au@Ag-2.5
as the sample by using the XPEEM endstation (BL09U, dreamline) of
Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) with a spectroscopic
photoemission and low energy electron microscopy (SPELEEM-III, Elmitec
GmbH) system. The surface chemical composition obtained from XPS can
provide more useful information about the alloying process during
local heating (from room temperature to 550 °C). As shown in Figure S7, below 425 °C, no Au signal could
be detected. When the temperature reached 550 °C, an obvious
Au peak, corresponding to Au 4f5/2 (located at 87.8 eV)
and Au 4f7/2 (located at 84.0 eV), can be observed, indicating
that 550 °C may be a reasonable temperature for the preparation
of fully alloyed NRs with well-maintained morphology, which is very
close to our estimated result.

The fully alloyed AuAg NRs not
only possess strong LSPR property originated from the Ag component
but also show superior chemical stability coming from the gold part.
By using a mixed solvent of ammonia hydroxide (NH4OH) and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an artificial corrosive
environment, we directly examined the chemical stability of both Au@Ag
core–shell NRs and fully alloyed AuAg NRs. It is well known
that the oxidizing and complexing agents can severely and rapidly
etch metallic Ag but not Au. As revealed in the UV–vis spectra,
the outstanding plasmonic property of the fully alloyed NRs can be
well maintained after being kept in the mixing solution for 48 h with
only a minor deterioration (∼6%) in the band intensity (as
shown in Figure 3a).
In a striking contrast, the Au@Ag core–shell NRs exhibited
a significantly lower stability because the Ag layer was unable to
survive in the presence of NH4OH and H2O2. As a result, the plasmon band of Au@Ag NRs rapidly red-shifted
to the position of Au NRs within 1 min, suggesting that the Ag shells
have been etched (as shown in Figure 3b). Moreover, the extinction intensity decreased rapidly.
From the above-mentioned results, we can conclude that fully alloyed
AuAg NRs possess the advantages from the two components.

spectra showing the stability of (a) fully alloyed AuAg NRs-2.5 and
(b) Au@Ag NRs-2.5 in the mixing solution of NH4OH (0.5
M) and H2O2 (0.5 M).

To
demonstrate the merits and significance of fully alloyed AuAg NRs
in practical applications, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
detection was employed to demonstrate the superior property of different
nanocrystals for in situ SERS monitoring in a colloidal suspension.
The Au NRs, Au@Ag NRs, and fully alloyed NRs were prepared first with
a 20 μL volume, followed by the incubation with a common dye
rhodamine 6G (R6G) in an artificial wastewater. In order to mimic
the conditions of dyeing or textile industrial effluent, the following
compounds were added: salt (NaCl), oxidants (H2O2), bases (NaOH), and organic matters (methanol). Ag-based substrates
are unable to survive in such a harsh condition for a relatively long
soaking time, because metallic Ag will be etched rapidly, resulting
in a significant deterioration in its SERS performance. In these circumstances,
the design of AuAg alloy systems could address the sensitivity of
SERS properties and also impart enhancements of stability and durability
based on their remarkable SPR effect and resistance to harsh conditions.
Au NRs and Au@Ag NRs of the same concentration were employed as the
references. Figure 4 shows SERS spectra recorded from the samples with different compositions
and structures by controlling the soaking time. By monitoring the
SERS peak at 1364 cm–1 (the carbon skeleton stretching
vibration mode of the Raman probe R6G), we found that the signal intensity
of fully alloyed AuAg NRs significantly increased in 10 min by 1.3
and 6.0 times in comparison with naked Au NRs and Au@Ag NRs, respectively.
It is suggested that the presence of Ag atoms on Au NRs could remarkably
enhance the SERS performance. However, the intensity of Raman signal
in the case of Au@Ag NRs dropped by ca. 70% as the soaking time increased
to 60 min, which can be ascribed to the oxidative etching of Ag shells
in the wastewater. As a comparison, the Au NRs exhibited stable Raman
signals, which was relatively poor. For the fully alloyed AuAg NRs,
the high SERS performance of Ag and superior stability of Au can be
realized in the corrosive environment even after soaking for a long
time (Figure 4b). The
formation of alloyed nanostructures through this solar-light-assistant
approach can be also extended to other compounds. For example, AuPd
alloy NRs can be prepared by irradiating the Au@Pd@SiO2 with solar light, as shown in Figure S8.

Conclusions
In summary,
we have demonstrated an efficient approach to make fully alloyed AuAg
NRs through a photothermal nano-oven. The effective alloying of Au
and Ag atoms can be ascribed to the remarkable photothermal effect
of Au and Ag, as well as the thermal insulating effect and the physical
confinement of silica shell. More importantly, the anisotropic nanostructure
can be well maintained after the alloying process. The as-prepared
AuAg alloy NRs showed outstanding SPR property and great chemical
stability against chemical etching. As a result, they can be used
for SERS detection in practical applications. This simple approach
could be also extended to the preparation of alloy nanostructures
with different compositions. This new method may open up a new approach
for the preparation of nanostructures with desired properties that
cannot be achieved using traditional synthetic methods.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Au NRs
Au NRs were prepared using a seeded-growth
method in a binary surfactant system reported by Ye.31,49 Typically, 0.7 g of CTAB, 0.124 g of sodium oleate, 1.6 mL of AgNO3 (4 mM), 0.984 mL of HAuCl4 (25.4 mM), and 0.3
mL of HCl (37 wt %) were mixed in 50 mL of water. Into the mixing
solution was quickly added 0.125 mL of l-ascorbic acid (64
mM) and 0.06 mL of seed solution, which was reduced by NaBH4. After about 5–6 h, the as-obtained Au NRs were collected
by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min and redispersed in 5 mL of
water.

Preparation of Core@Shell Au@Ag
NRs@SiO2
The synthesis of core@shell Au@Ag NRs
was conducted in a CTAC solution.32,33 In a typical
synthesis route, 5 mL of Au NRs solution was added into 30 mL of CTAC
solution (80 mM). Then, 1 mL of AgNO3 (10 mM) was added,
followed by 0.5 mL of l-ascorbic acid (100 mM). The reaction
solution was continuously stirred at 65 °C for 3 h. The Ag+ ions can be slowly reduced by AA and deposited on the Au
NRs. The thickness of Ag shell can be tuned by adding different amounts
of AgNO3 solution. The obtained samples were named as Au@Ag
NRs-5, -2.5, -1.2 when the molar ratio of Au/Ag is 5, 2.5, and 1.2,
respectively. Coating SiO2 shell on the surface of Au@Ag
NRs was performed according to previous reports,50 in which TEOS was used as the silica source and CTAB was
used as the surfactant.

Alloying AuAg
NRs
The obtained Au@Ag NRs@SiO2 was deposited
on the surface of a quartz slide with an area of 1 cm × 1 cm.
A 300 W xenon lamp (Aulight, CEL-HXF300) was employed as the irradiation
source with the wavelength from 300 to 1000 nm, as shown in Figure S9. An optical filter was used to remove
the light below 420 nm. During the drying and alloying process, a
nitrogen atmosphere is applied. The irradiation time was kept as 8
h.

In Situ XPS
XPS measurements
were conducted at the XPEEM endstation (BL09U, dreamline) of SSRF
with a spectroscopic photoemission and low energy electron microscopy
(SPELEEM-III, Elmitec GmbH) system.

SERS Measurements
In a typical process, 20 μL of AuAg
alloy NRs solution was dried on a Si substrate in vacuum, which was
then soaked in a 50 μL of mixed solution to mimic an industrial
dyeing wastewater for 10 or 60 min. The artificial wastewater was
composed of 5 vol % methanol, 10–3 mM R6G, 5 wt
% NaCl, 5 mM H2O2, and 5 mM NH4OH.
The Si substrate was then dried in vacuum and the SERS signals were
excited with a 633 nm laser. As the references, the SERS activity
of Au NRs and Au@Ag NRs with the same concentrations was also investigated.
The different samples have a concentration of approximately 1014 NRs/mL.
