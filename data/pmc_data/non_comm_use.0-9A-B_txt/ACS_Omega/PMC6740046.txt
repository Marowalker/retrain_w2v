This study reports
on the adsorption (dehumidification)–desorption
(humidification) behavior of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) coated
starch particles (SPs), denoted as SP-CPB, as a potential desiccant
material for air-to-air energy exchangers. CPB is a cationic surfactant
with antibacterial activity that can be used to modify the surface
properties of SPs, especially at variable CPB loading levels (SP-CPB0.5,
SP-CPB2.5, and SP-CPB5.0, where the numeric suffix represents the
synthetic loading level of CPB in mM). The SP-CPB0.5 sample displayed
optimal surface area and pore structure properties that was selected
for water sorption isotherm studies at 25 °C. The CPB-coated
SPs sample (SP-CPB0.5) showed an improved water vapor uptake capacity
compared to unmodified starch (SPs) and other desiccant systems such
as high amylose starch (HAS15) and silica gel (SG13). Single-step and cyclic water vapor sorption tests were conducted
using a small-scale exchanger coated with SP-CPB0.5. The calculated
latent effectiveness values obtained from direct measurements using
cyclic tests (65.4 ± 2%) agree closely with the estimated latent
effectiveness from single-step tests (64.6 ± 2%) at controlled
operating conditions. Compared to HAS15- and SG13-coated exchangers, the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger performed much
better at controlled operating conditions, along with improved longevity
due to the CPB surface coating. The presence of CPB did not attenuate
the uptake properties of native SPs. Latent effectiveness of SP-CPB0.5-coated
exchanger was enhanced (5–30% higher) over that of the SG13- or HAS15-coated exchangers, according to the
wheel angular speed. This study reports on a novel and sustainable
SP-CPB0.5 material as a promising desiccant coating with tunable uptake
and surface properties with potential utility in air-to-air energy
exchangers for ventilation systems.

==== Body
Introduction
Indoor air quality (IAQ) plays a key role
on the mental and physical
health of occupants, affecting their comfort and productivity.1 The IAQ and comfort in buildings mainly depend
on the air temperature, humidity, and outdoor ventilation rate within
indoor air environments. Different space heating/cooling methods are
available to maintain the indoor air temperature within the optimal
comfort zone.2 Considering human health
and comfort, the relative humidity (RH) levels between 30 and 60%
are recommended.3 Researchers are currently
focused on developing new technologies to reduce the energy footprint
of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, while
maintaining the required level of IAQ and comfort.

There is
continued interest in the study of desiccant materials
due to their critical role as functional coatings in HVAC systems,
especially for applications in air-to-air energy exchangers (AAEEs).
The central importance of desiccants and their water vapor adsorption–desorption
properties in AAEEs relates to the improvement in energy efficiency
of HVAC systems. The global energy footprint and greenhouse gas emissions
related to heating and cooling of residential and commercial buildings
is substantial. The heating and cooling of buildings (commercial,
residential, and industrial) accounts for 30–50% of energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in Canada4 and the EU.5 Furthermore, the
demand for cooling is expected to increase almost exponentially (by
30 times over this century) due to climate change and increased demand
in developing countries.6 Currently, about
60% of energy consumed by residential buildings, while 54% of energy
consumed by commercial buildings are used for space heating, cooling,
and ventilation in Canada.7 Thus, HVAC
systems account for 15–30% of global energy consumption. It
follows that activities related to the research and development of
improved desiccant coatings can have significant impact on the efficiency
of AAEEs and thereby lower the energy consumption and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions.

Among various types of AAEEs, energy wheels
are widely used in
large-scale commercial applications because of their unique capability
for the transfer of both heat and moisture between air streams. Energy
wheels have two main components: the substrate and desiccant. The
substrate is typically a thin aluminum sheet that is crimped and wound
to form a perforated wheel to allow airflow and enable sensible heat
transfer through the wheel architecture. The desiccant is a hygroscopic
material that is coated onto the substrate to allow moisture transfer
(adsorption/desorption of water vapor) due to the gradient of water
vapor pressure between the airflow streams and the surface of the
desiccant.8,9 Therefore, research on the nature of the
desiccant and strategies to enhance the sorption properties is a key
area of research and development.

Desiccants can be selected
from inorganic materials such as silica
gels (SGs),10−13 zeolites (molecular sieves),13,14 activated alumina,15−17 to organic desiccants such as porous/activated carbons.12,17,18 Also, hybrid substrates such
as synthesized silica gel-composite materials19−21 and metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have been reported.22−26 Research on alternative desiccants such as starch,
wheat, cassava, corn grit, and durian peel suggest that agriculture-based
biomass possess unique water adsorption–desorption capabilities
with additional benefits of low cost, high abundance, and sustainable
nature.27−29 Recently, Fathieh et al.30,31 conducted a sorption study on high amylose starch (HAS15) using the component testing of an energy wheel, where the performance
of HAS15 and mesopouros silica gels (SG13) with
variable particle sizes were compared (commercial solid desiccants).
Latent effectiveness is the one of the most important parameters to
quantify the moisture transfer performance of air-to-air energy exchangers.32 It is defined as the ratio of the actual moisture
transfer rate to the thermodynamic maximum moisture transfer rate
and therefore is restricted to have values between 0 and 1.32,33 It was reported that the latent effectiveness of the HAS15-coated exchanger was 2–13% greater than a commercial desiccant
(SG13-coating) for similar loading levels and at variable
operating conditions. In a follow-up study on a HAS15-coated
small-scale exchanger, Dehabadi et al.34 reported on the effects of air flow on the water vapor adsorption–desorption
processes using a single-step transient testing at variable air flow
rates and temperatures. The results indicated an acceptable exchanger
performance for the HAS15-coated exchanger over a range
of temperatures (22.5–37.5 °C) and flow rates (10–50
L/min) that further reveal the potential of high amylose starch-based
desiccants. More recently, Hossain et al.35 compared the performance of a coated exchanger that used starch
particles with high amylopectin content (SP15) that was
compared against HAS15- and SG13-coated exchangers
with comparable desiccant loadings. Among these desiccants, the weight-based
moisture recovery (g of water vapor/g of desiccant) of SP15 (0.152) was 3-fold over HAS15 and 6-fold greater over
SG13 (0.026). The impressive moisture recovery, along with
∼98% regeneration of the SP-based dessicant during the vapor
desorption process relates to the unique biopolymer structure such
as its hydrophilic character, structural flexibility, and accessibility
of the biopolymer surface −OH groups. The favorable balance
between the adsorption and desorption properties reported for the
SPs was referred to as the “Goldilocks effect”, as evidenced
by comparable differences in the enthalpy for the adsorption/desorption
(ΔHads/ΔHdes) process with water vapor.35 The magnitude of ΔHads/ΔHdes below |50 kJ/mol| was indicative of a physisorption
process,35 indicating that the SP-based
desiccant was highly suitable as a coating material in AAEE systems.

While the adsorption–desorption properties were deemed favorable
under dynamic flow conditions for SPs, the potential longevity of
starch under moderate temperature and humidity conditions36,37 was a potential concern for AAEEs, especially for multiple adsorption–desorption
cycles over extended time intervals. To address this concern and characterize
the physicochemical properties of surface-modified SPs, a study38 was undertaken to explore the role of surface
modification of SPs using various dopant levels (0.5, 2.5, and 5.0
mM) of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) relative to unmodified SPs. The
respective dopant levels of CPB surfactant onto the surface of SPs
correspond to the monolayer surface coverage (SP-CPB0.5), while elevated
CPB levels in the case of SP-CPB2.5 and SP-CPB5.0 concur with a multilayer
surface coverage reported elsewhere.38,39 The water
sorption properties of SPs in liquid water at variable CPB dopant
levels did not significantly attenuate the water sorption properties,
as compared with unmodified SPs. By contrast, the longevity of SPs
was improved for SP-CPB0.5, as evidenced by the enhanced antimicrobial
activity of CPB toward a range of bacterial strains, as compared with
unmodified SPs.38 The aim of this paper
is to further our research efforts toward new biopolymer desiccants40−42 with improved sorption capacity, adsorption/desorption regeneration,
and temporal stability by testing surfactant-coated SPs. Herein, SP-CPB0.5
(surfactant concentration = 0.5 mM) was selected based on a previous
optimization study. The current study reports on the comparison of
the latent performance of SP-CPB0.5 as a desiccant with those of two
types of desiccants (SG13 and HAS15) using sorption/desorption
tests of water vapor with a small-scale energy exchanger developed
in-house.41

Several objectives are
pursued in the current study: (1) to compare
the water vapor adsorption–desorption properties of surfactant-modified
SPs relative to native SPs desiccant coatings and (2) to understand
the structure–function relationship of the CPB-coated SPs at
typical conditions relevant to AAEEs. In this study, we highlight
the development of a sustainable and tunable surface-modified starch-based
desiccant with unique vapor adsorption (dehumidification) and desorption
(regeneration) properties. Moreover, it will be shown that the use
of facile surfactant doping via deposition of CPB onto SPs does not
attenuate the unique vapor adsorption–desorption properties
according to the remarkable “Goldilocks effect” previously
reported for unmodified SPs. The latter is considered as a hallmark
feature for key technological advancements in the design of sustainable
desiccant materials to enable efficient energy harvesting in energy
wheel applications.

Results and Discussion
As noted
above, Karoyo et al.38 carried
out a systematic study of the surface modification of starch particles
(SPs) with CPB in an effort to determine the optimal level of monolayer
surfactant doping (cf. Figure 9 in ref (35) or Figure 1 in ref (38)). According to the trends
in solvent swelling results in water, CPB-doped SPs revealed optimal
swelling for surface-modified SPs at a loading concentration of 0.5
mM for the CPB surfactant (SP-CPB0.5). The optimal surfactant loading
was further aided by other complementary thermoanalytical and spectroscopic
methods, as described elsewhere.38,39 In the present
study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and water vapor adsorption isotherms were used
to gain further insight into the “Goldilocks effect”35 through the study of the dynamic vapor adsorption
properties of SPs modified with CPB using a small-scale coated exchanger
developed in-house.41

starch particles (SPs) and cetylpyridinium
bromide-coated SPs (SP-CPB0.5). (a) 80k× magnification and (b)
150k× magnification of SPs. (c) 100k× magnification and
(d) 150k× magnification of SP-CPB0.5. The layer-by-layer amorphous
and crystalline domains are indicated with dotted ovals.

TEM
The TEM images of the SPs and SP-CPB0.5 are shown
in Figure 1a,b, respectively. Figure 1a reveals the semi-crystalline
nature of the SPs which contains alternating layer-by-layer (marked
with dotted ovals in the image) amorphous and crystalline domains
arranged in concentric rings.43 Furthermore,
the shape of the SPs are composed mostly of spherical granules, with
a few distinctly elongated granules.44 In
contrast to the morphology of SPs (Figure 1a), the TEM image of the SP-CPB0.5 (Figure 1b) is characterized
by larger and darker granules without the apparent layer-by-layer
structural features. The apparent difference in morphology of the
SP-CPB0.5 relative to that of unmodified SPs is related to the presence
of a bound CPB at the surface of SPs. The surface-bound CPB surfactant
may contribute to alteration of the hydrophile–lipophile balance
(HLB) of the interface, in agreement with the larger granule size
and agglomeration of the CPB-doped SPs due to hydrophobic interactions,
as noted in Figure 1b.45,46

XPS
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is a useful
method for gaining information regarding the state of chemical structure
of biopolymer materials.47 In this study,
XPS was used to investigate the effect of the CPB surfactant on the
structure of the SPs. Figure 2 shows normalized XPS spectra of CPB, SP-CPB0.5, and SPs.
The peaks at ∼282.5 and ∼284 eV reveal the presence
of sp2 and sp3 orbitals of C 1s, respectively.
These orbitals are related to the C–H and C–C and C–O
bonds of the SPs.48 Also, the presence
of O 1s at ∼530 eV and N 1s at ∼398 eV relate to the
heteroatoms of starch and the peptide components in the starch granule,
respectively. Further survey of the XPS spectra in Figure 2 reveals the presence of Br
3d5/2, Br 3d3/2, and Br 3p signatures at ∼66,
∼68, and ∼184 eV, respectively. These peaks account
for the presence of the Br–C bonds in the CPB sample49 that provide further support of the adhesive
binding interaction of the CPB surfactant with the SPs, in line with
the TEM results in Figure 1b. In particular, the signature at ∼66 eV corresponds
to the Br 3d that provides evidence of the CPB coating on the starch.
It should be noted that the low intensity of this band relates to
the relatively small amount of CPB (0.5 mM) used in the coating.

particles (SP-CPB0.5, black), and native starch particles (SPs, blue).

Water Vapor Adsorption
Figure 3 shows the water
vapor adsorption isotherms
of the native SPs (a) and SP-CPB0.5 (b) samples at 25 °C, where
the results of the sample of SPs coated at higher CPB loading (SP-CPB5.0, Figure 3c,d) are compared.
In the stacked plots in Figure 3d, the water vapor uptake capacity (w/w %) for the SP-CPB5.0
sample (36.5%) is comparable to the value for the SP-CPB0.5 sample
(36.0%), whereas lower values are reported for native SP samples (33.5%).
The relative similarity of the SP-CPX (X = 0.5 and 5) above may be
related to the comparable surface accessibility of the active hydrophile
sites in spite of variable CPB loading. In general, the isotherm results
in Figure 3 reveal
type II isotherm profiles that are characterized as macroporous materials
with unrestricted monolayer–multilayer adsorption profiles.50,51 At low relative pressures (P/P0), near 0.2 (∼10 wt %), the water molecules can
be adsorbed at the surface of the native and coated SPs samples that
results in the formation of a monolayer adsorption profile. At P/P0 > 0.8 (>20 wt %),
the formation
of bilayer and/or multilayer surface-bound water profiles are anticipated
and the total water vapor capacity is reached at P/P0 = 0.95. The greater uptake capacity
at high P/P0 values indicate
a strong relation between adsorbent porosity and vapor uptake properties.
The uptake capacity values reported herein meet values reported by
Furukawa et al.24 where the wt % values
ranging between ∼8 and 68 were reported for zirconium-based
MOFs and related materials. It is worth noting that the adsorptive
interactions of water with solid bioadsorbent materials is governed
by several factors: (i) accessible surface functional groups, (ii)
the polarity and HLB of the bioadsorbent, and (iii) the presence of
amorphous and crystalline domains of the adsorbent that relates to
the relative amylose (linear) versus amylopectin (branched) content
of starch.52

adsorption/desorption (dashed lines) profiles

among the desiccants at 25 °C.

In the case of native SPs, it is noteworthy that water vapor can
access the active hydrophilic starch domains. By contrast, the surface
−OH functional groups are less accessible for the CPB-coated
SPs. In the case of CPB-coated SPs, the outer surface is characterized
by steric effects due to the bound surfactant on the starch surface
and contributions from particle aggregation, as described in the TEM
and XPS results. The trends in the water vapor uptake capacity herein
(i.e., SP-CPB5.0 (36.5%) ≥ SP-CPB0.5 (36.0%) > SPs (33.5%))
reveal that the interaction of water vapor with the starch samples
is achieved via both adsorption and absorption (sorption) processes.
The foregoing indicates that the coated SP samples (i.e., SP-CPB0.5
and SP-CPB-5.0) contain variable hydrophile sites (ionic CPB domains
or dipolar starch sites) that slightly favor the uptake of water vapor
over the native SPs. The effect of the surface-bound CPB is to afford
additional pores or hydrophile sites that enhance the vapor permeability
of the CPB-coated starch, in line with the results for cassava starch
coated with a nonionic surfactant reported by Brandelero et al.53 The minor differences in water vapor uptake
capacity for the SP-CPB0.5 and SP-CPB5.0 systems may be related to
compensation between CPB steric effects and the variable number of
ion adsorption sites (HLB) character of the bound surfactant chains
onto the surface of SPs.38

It is
important to note that the mechanism of surface binding for
liquid water versus gaseous water onto the surface of starch may differ
markedly since the latter is largely driven by the diffusion of water
molecules and their subsequent absorption within the pores and surface
sites. Thus, the self-assembly of CPB in the SP-CPB0.5 and SP-CPB5.0
samples provide favorable conditions for the adsorption of water vapor,
where similar vapor uptake capacities are observed for these systems.
The
high water uptake capacities and efficient water vapor adsorption/desorption
rates are further detailed herein (vide infra). The water vapor adsorption
processes for energy harvesting applications should be characterized
by favorable enthalpies of adsorption (≤50 kJ/mol) to afford
easy regeneration of the desiccant during the desorption process,
in accordance with the “Goldilocks effect” described
elsewhere.35,54

It is concluded from the
above results that the adsorption of CPB
occurs at the surface sites of the SPs that may affect the resulting
particle size distribution (due to agglomeration), ζ-potential
values, and HLB of the starch particles. These physiochemical properties
are known to influence the water vapor adsorption properties39 and are supported by the adsorption isotherms,
XPS, and TEM results herein. Among the variable surfactant loadings
onto the SPs, the SP-CPB0.5 system provides optimal conditions for
effective moisture adsorption and desorption properties as described
above and elsewhere.39

Single-Step
Experiment Results
The normalized humidity
ratio, or the transient response of the small-scale coated exchanger,
is defined as the ratio of the difference in humidity ratio of the
exchanger at any time to the maximum difference during the test. It
can be calculated using eq 1, where W is the humidity ratio (kgw/kgair) of air stream at the exchanger outlets. 1  

The humidity ratio of air
streams at
the exchanger inlet and outlet was calculated from the temperature
and relative humidity measurements.55 The
transient dehumidification and regeneration responses (break-through
curve) of the SP-CPB0.5-coated small-scale exchanger, W, versus time are shown in Figure 4. During the dehumidification (adsorption), W slowly increases from 0 at time 0 s to 0.95 at about 300
s (Figure 4a). This
indicates that the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger reached about 95% of
its equilibrium moisture content during the initial 300 s. As the
test continued, the humidity level of supply and exhaust air streams
can reach the same value of moisture content (W =
1.0). The reverse trend occurs during the desorption process, where W slowly decreases from 1.0 at the beginning of the step
change to about 0.05 after 600 s.

Figure 4 Normalized humidity response (break-through
curve) of SP-CPB0.5
small-scale exchanger during (a) dehumidification (adsorption) and
(b) regeneration (desorption) (ΔRH = 40%, maximum uncertainty
in the experimental data is UW = ±
0.05).

The dehumidification and regeneration
latent effectiveness (ϵ)
of an energy wheel can be estimated from an analysis of their normalized
humidity response trends.56 First, the
number of mass transfer units (NTUm) is predicted by fitting
a double exponential model to the normalized humidity response curves.
Then, the latent effectiveness of counter-flow energy exchanger for
the balanced supply and exhaust air streams can be estimated using eq 2. Detailed expressions
and methods to determine the latent effectiveness from the transient
humidity response were reported in a previous work.56 2  

Figure 5 shows
the
estimated latent effectiveness values from the single-step change
test results at various wheel angular speeds (ω). The results
indicate that the latent effectiveness of wheel increases with increase
in angular speed, which is expected from the literature.57−59 The moisture transfer rate between the desiccants and air streams
is maximum at the beginning of each adsorption/desorption cycle, thus
a shorter cycle period (higher angular speed) will result in a higher
effectiveness. At low angular speeds, the desiccant is exposed to
the air stream for long durations and gradually the desiccant reaches
its capacity; hence, the moisture transfer rate decreases, which reduces
the latent effectiveness. The estimated latent effectiveness during
adsorption (dehumidification) is slightly higher than during desorption
(regeneration) at all of the angular speeds investigated. The difference
in the latent effectiveness decreases as the angular speed (ω)
increases. At the lowest ω tested (0.5 rpm), the difference
is about 4%, whereas at the highest value of ω tested (20 rpm),
a 1% difference occurs. These trends are consistent with the capillary
condensation effects within the pore structure of the SP-CPB0.5 desiccant,
in agreement with the water adsorption and SEM results herein and
results from previous literature reports.35,56 The results also show that the difference between the adsorption
and desorption effectiveness is within the uncertainty limit of the
experimental measurements at ω ≥ 2.5 rpm (Table 1).

Figure 5 Latent effectiveness
of the SP-CPB0.5-coated
exchanger during adsorption
(dehumidification) and desorption (regeneration) cycles. The values
are estimated through the step change in the inlet relative humidity
(ΔRH = 40%) at different wheel angular speeds.

Cyclic Experiment Results
The latent effectiveness
of energy wheels can also be determined by conducting cyclic experiments.
The operating conditions of an energy wheel using the cyclic test
facility are identical to the single-step tests reported in Table 2. To compare with
previous reported work,35 the cyclic experiments
were conducted at an angular wheel speed of 0.5 rpm. The relative
humidity at the exchanger outlet is measured continuously during the
adsorption and desorption cycles. The latent effectiveness is determined
after exchanger has reached a periodic steady state, using eqs 3 and 4 3   4

where ṁ is the mass flow rate of dry air
(kg/s) and subscripts 1–4 refer to sensor in ducts 1–4
in Figure 10. In eq 3, ṁ(W1 – W2) is the moisture adsorption rate for the exchanger during the adsorption
or dehumidification cycle; in eq 4, (W4 – W2) is the moisture desorption rate from the exchanger
during the desorption or regeneration cycle.

Figure 6 shows the
absolute water content profile of the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger for
four consecutive cycles after 1 h upon reaching a periodic steady-state/equilibrium
condition. The results show that during the first half of each cycle,
when humid air stream passes through the exchanger, the desiccants
adsorb moisture, and the air becomes dry at the exchanger exit (dehumidification/adsorption
cycle). In the second phase of each cycle, the desiccants start releasing
adsorbed water vapor when dry air passes through the exchanger, resulting
in an exit air stream that becomes more humid (regeneration/desorption
cycle). This process continues during every adsorption–desorption
cycle. The results also reveal that the CP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger
can transfer similar level of water vapor during dehumidification
(adsorption) and regeneration (desorption) cycles. This may indicate
that the surfactant-coated desiccants maintain their physiochemical
properties during the cyclic experiments. However, the durability
of the material in multiple cycles over extended time warrant further
investigation in future studies.

Figure 6 Cyclic moisture content profile of the
SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger.

The average dehumidification and regeneration effectiveness of
individual cycles after reaching a steady state can be calculated
from the average humidity ratio (water content) of the outlet and
inlet air streams. Detailed expressions and methods to calculate the
average latent effectiveness for cyclic testing are reported elsewhere.41,56 It is important to mention that the decrease/increase of RH values
during the first 8 s of each dehumidification/regeneration cycle arises
from the time delay in the response of the RH sensors.60,61 Therefore, these values were not accounted for in the effectiveness
calculation of the cyclic tests. The maximum and minimum RH values
during dehumidification and regeneration cycles were taken as the
initial reference points, respectively. The latent effectiveness of
the exchanger for each adsorption and desorption cycle from 101 to
106 are calculated and shown in Figure 7. The results are in agreement with the estimated effectiveness
from the single-step experiments, where the latent effectiveness of
the regeneration was ca. 2% higher than that of the dehumidification
step.

Figure 7 Average steady-state latent effectiveness of adsorption (dehumidification)
and desorption (regeneration) cycles.

Figure 8 compares
the latent effectiveness of SP-CPB0.5 for a coated small-scale exchanger
calculated from the cyclic test (0.5 rpm) that was estimated from
the single-step test (break-through curves). The average latent effectiveness
from cyclic tests is 65.4 ± 2 and 70.7 ± 2% for the dehumidification
and regeneration cycles, respectively. The estimated values from single-step
tests, which were slightly less than those from the cyclic tests,
are 64.6 ± 2 and 68.2 ± 2% for the dehumidification and
regeneration step changes, respectively. Results clearly indicate
that the calculated values from the cyclic testing agree with the
estimated values from the single-step testing within the uncertainty
of the measurements. It means that both cyclic and single-step tests
can accurately estimate the steady-state performance of the energy
wheels in a laboratory-scale facility. On the other hand, the cyclic
test is more practical since it is a direct measurement of the effectiveness
since there is no need to predict the latent effectiveness of the
wheel by using data fitting and correlations.

effectiveness from single-step and cyclic
experiments.

Latent Effectiveness Comparison
Figure 9 compares the estimated values of the latent effectiveness
for various desiccant-coated wheels at the operating condition given
in Table 2 and different
wheel angular speeds (ω), where ω ∼ 0.5 rpm and
dehumidification: SP-CPB0.5 (68 ± 2%) > SP15 (64
±
2%) > HAS15 (46 ± 2%) > SG13 (38
±
2%). Results show that SP-coated wheels display the best performance
for the entire tested angular speed (ω) range. The surfactant-coated
starch desiccant performs best during humidification (adsorption).
By comparison, the surfactant-coated starch desiccant (SP-CPB0.5)
performs best during the dehumidification (adsorption), whereas the
native starch desiccant (SP15) performs best during regeneration
(desorption).

Results for SP15, HAS15, and SG13 are adopted from ref (30). SP-CPB0.5 (surfactant-coated starch particles), SP15 (native starch particles), HAS15 (high amylose starch),
and SG13 (silica gel).

It is well-known that in addition to the sorption uptake capacity
of the desiccants, the kinetic rate of sorption is a parameter of
key importance in the performance of energy wheels.62,63 Although SP-CPB0.5 had a greater water uptake capacity over SP (Figure 3), it seems that
the presence of a surfactant coating may result in steric effects
on the starch particle surface with a decreased desorption rate. Thus,
the regeneration of SP-CPB0.5 becomes slightly attenuated relative
to SP15, resulting in a lower latent effectiveness of the
SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger as compared with the SP15-coated
exchanger.

The results also show that the estimated latent effectiveness
of
the SP-CPB0.5-coated wheels, especially at low angular speed (ω
< 1), was slightly lower (ca. 2–4%) during the regeneration
cycles than during the humidification cycles. This can be related
to capillary condensation within the pores of desiccants, which often
requires more energy input during regeneration of desiccants than
the dehumidification process.30,35 The estimated latent
effectiveness increases with increasing angular speeds.57−59 Thus, it can be concluded that the system may have greater efficiency
at typical operating wheel angular speeds (ω ∼10–20
rpm) relative to lower values for ω reported above.

It
is important to note that the break-through curves cannot be
expressed according to a per unit mass of desiccant since the estimated
latent effectiveness is mass dependent. As shown in Table 1, the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger
had the lowest desiccant/matrix mass ratio among other coated sheets
reported, despite the observation that the SP-CPB0.5 system outperformed
the HAS15- and SG13-coated exchangers. In general,
the latent effectiveness of the SP-CPB0.5-coated exchanger was between
5 and 30% higher, where the difference depends on the wheel angular
speed, as compared with the SG13- or HAS15-coated
exchangers. As well, surfactant coating onto the starch particles
did not compromise the performance, as compared with the SP15 (native starch) coated exchanger. Therefore, SP-CPB0.5 represents
a notable advancement in desiccant design for sustainable energy wheel
fabrication. However, further research is needed to investigate the
performance of SP-CPB0.5 at a wider range of operating conditions
to assess its durability over a longer life cycle of operation.

Conclusions
This study reports on the water vapor adsorption–desorption
process of starch particles (SPs) from the seed of the Prairie carnation
that was surface modified with cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) surfactant
using a facile adsorption method. The SP-CPB0.5 sample (where the
CPB loading concentration was maintained at 0.5 mM) denotes a CPB-coated
SPs that was studied herein due to its unique surface/textural and
water uptake properties. The SP-CPB0.5 sample was characterized using
XPS, where various CPB doping levels provide evidence of favorable
suface interaction of CPB with the surface of SPs. The morphology
of SP-CPB0.5 was further characterized using TEM, which showed alteration
of the layer-by-layer granule structure of pristine SPs, where agglomeration
of the CPB-coated SPs is understood due to hydrophobic effects arising
from CPB doping of SPs. Water vapor adsorption–desorption isotherms
of pristine SPs and SP-CPB0.5 samples were compared for SPs coated
with greater (5.0 mM) CPB loading (SP-CPB5.0). The trends in the relative
water vapor uptake capacity at 25 °C at a fixed relative partial
pressure (P/P0 = 0.95)
adopt the following order: SP-CPB5.0 (36.5%) ≥ SP-CPB0.5 (36.0%)
> SPs (33.5%). The trend reveals a greater water uptake capacity
of
CPB-coated SPs over native SPs, in agreement with the creation of
favorable pore and surface sites with enhanced vapor permeability
SPs with surface-bound CPB. The single-step and steady-state cyclic
experiments were conducted using a SP-CPB0.5-coated small-scale exchanger,
where a comparison of native SPs revealed notable differences relative
to high amylose starch (HAS15) and silica gel (SG13) desiccants. The latent effectiveness obtained from both the transient
and steady-state methods for the adsorption (dehumidification) cycle
are in good agreement within the experimental uncertainty limits (65.4
± 2 and 64.6 ± 2%) for the cyclic and single-step experiments,
respectively. The estimated latent effectiveness for the CPB-modified
(SP-CPB0.5) and pristine SPs-coated exchanger were comparable and
exceeded those of SG13- and HAS15-coated exchangers.
Whereas the CPB surface coating onto SPs serves to improve the temporal
longevity of the desiccant properties of SPs, the CPB coating of SPs
does not compromise the moisture transfer (latent) capability relative
to native SPs (without CPB coating). Thus, surfactant-coated starch
particles (SP-CPB0.5) may serve as an alternative desiccant material
for energy wheel applications with improvements to the wheel performance
longevity of the desiccant at moderate temperature and humidity conditions,
as compared with native starch desiccants.

Experimental Section
Materials
The granular SPs from the seed of the local
Prairie carnation plant were supplied by Canadian Carnation BioProducts
Inc. Cetylpyridium bromide (CPB) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich
(ON, Canada). Aluminum sheets (Al-3003, thickness of 0.62 ± 0.05
mm) were purchased from McMaster-Carr Supply Company.

Preparation
of CPB-Coated Starch Particles
The preparation
of the CPB-coated starch particles (SP-CPBX; where X represent the
loading concentration of the CPB surfactant) was adopted from a previous
report.38 The SP-CPB0.5 sample was chosen
for this study based on its unique spherical morphology and optimum
water uptake and swelling properties as characterized in the previous
study.38,39

Preparation of Parallel-Plate Exchanger
Rectangular
aluminum plates with dimensions of 8 cm × 20 cm were cut from
the Al-3003 sheets. The SP desiccant was coated onto the Al sheets
using a sieving method that was developed in a previous study.35 The SPs with particle sizes less than 125 μm
were screened with 120 mesh US standard sieve and then applied on
the surface of a thin (0.035 mm) adhesive-aluminum tape attached to
aluminum plates. Finally, any excess desiccants on the substrate surface
were removed by blowing pressurized air to the desiccant-coated exchanger
sheets. Sieving method does not use any external adhesives and the
desiccant material directly adheres to the adhesive aluminum tape
and thus the sieved desiccant particles were applied in a uniform
monolayer on the Al substrate as described in a previous study.35 Upon completion of the coating, the SP-coated
Al plates were left to dry in open air for 24 h, followed by application
of a thin, uniform, and even layer of a 0.5 mM aqueous solution of
CPB surfactant through a hand-held spray nebulizer. The CPB-modified
SP-coated (SP-CPB0.5) Al plates were then dried in open air for 24
h, where the coating was observed to retain its original uniformity
without any visible bulging or perforation. A small-scale parallel-plate
exchanger (10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm) was assembled using 16
Al sheets coated with SP-CPB0.5, as shown in Figure 10B,c. Table 1 compares details of the average mass (g) and mass per unit plate
area (g/cm2) of the SP-CPB0.5-coated small-scale exchanger
with previous reports on desiccant-coated exchangers.35

exchanger with SP-CPB0.5-coated aluminum plates.

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
TEM images of
the SPs and SP-CPB0.5 samples were obtained using a Hitachi TEM system.
The voltage of the system was set at 80.0 kV. SPs and SP-CPB0.5 samples
were dispersed in methanol prior to deposition onto a carbon-coated
copper TEM grid.

X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS measurements
were collected using a Kratos (Manchester, U.K.) AXIS Supra system
equipped with a 500 mm Rowland circle monochromated, Al K-Alpha (1486.6
eV) source, and combined hemispherical analyzer and spherical mirror
analyzer. A spot size with a hybrid slot (300 × 700 μm)
was used. All survey scan spectra were collected in the binding energy
range of 0–1200 eV with 1 eV steps and a pass energy of 160
eV. High-resolution scans of 4 regions were also collected using 0.05
eV steps with a pass energy of 20 eV. An accelerating voltage of 15
keV and an emission current of 15 mA were used for the analysis.

Water Vapor Adsorption
The vapor adsorption analysis
of the SPs and CPB-coated SPs was established using an intelligent
gravimetric analyzer system (IGA-002) supplied by Hiden Isochema Ltd.
(Warrington, United Kingdom). IGA-002 is equipped with a sensitive
microbalance with a resolution of 0.1 μg and an uncertainty
of ±1 μg. The sample holder is housed within a stainless
steel reactor to create ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and eliminate
changes in the external environment. In this vapor adsorption experiment,
ca. 30–35 mg of solid SP samples were loaded in a stainless
steel sample holder and placed in a reactor chamber. The desired temperature
inside the reactor was precisely controlled using a water bath with
the accuracy of ±0.1°C. Prior to the start of the isotherm
measurements, the samples
were thoroughly degassed and dried at 70°C under vacuum (≈10–8 mbar) for 6 h and held isothermally at 25°C.
The adsorption isotherm measurements were acquired at 25°C for
different pressure set points in the relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0–1 with about 0.16
increments.

Experimental Test Facility
In this
study, two experimental
approaches were used to determine the latent effectiveness of the
CPB-coated SPs exchangers. Design and fabrication of the experimental
test facility has been addressed elsewhere.41,63,64 The schematic and photographs
of the test facility are shown in Figure 10A,B, respectively. Figure 10A shows a schematic of the test facility
consisting of two main sections: (I) air stream preconditioning section
and (II) test section.

The preconditioning section consists
of a supply air system where a compressor is in line with a dehumidifier.
The air stream conditions are controlled by the humidifier, mass flow
controllers, and heaters. The air stream temperature and relative
humidity (RH) can be changed to simulate different air stream operating
conditions. In the test section (Figure 10A), the air ducts 1 and 2 are the inlet
streams to the test exchanger and are used for the counter-flow air
supply to the exchanger. Flow straighteners are also placed in each
air stream before the exchanger inlet to provide a uniform velocity
profile at the inlet of the exchanger.

Thermocouples (6 in each
duct) and RH sensors (4 in each duct)
are placed upstream and downstream of the exchanger to measure the
temperatures and relative humidity of air streams. RH and temperature
of the outlet and inlet air streams were recorded with sampling frequency
intervals of 1 s. A cycle generator unit, consisting of two linear
slide actuators, moves the exchanger between the two air streams,
and consequently subjects the exchanger to continuous dehumidification
(adsorption) and regeneration (desorption) cycles. This allows us
to convert the rotation of wheel to a linear motion and therefore
simulate the actual operating conditions of a wheel. A signal-board
microcontroller was used to control the actuators for various cycle
frequencies, with frequency as high as 1 Hz (1000 ms period).

Single-Step
and Cyclic Experiments
The experimental
test facility, shown in Figure 10, was used to subject the SP-CPB0.5-coated plates within
the small-scale exchanger to a single-step change (termed single-step
experiment) or a series (cycles) of step changes (termed cyclic experiment)
in the inlet humidity. The condition of dry and humid air streams
for the single-step and cyclic tests are the same as those of the
previously reported literature listed in Table 1.30,35 In the single-step
experiment, the preconditioning of the test section was initially
carried out to achieve steady-state conditions for the test facility.
Then, a sudden step change in humidity was made in less than 1 s.
The test was run until the outlet air stream reached a steady-state
condition. In a single-step change experiment, the steady-state is
defined as the condition under which variations of temperature and
RH of a single air stream remain within the sensor uncertainty for
a period of 5 min. In the cyclic experiment, the exchanger was exposed
to a series of continuous adsorption/desorption cycles, and the test
was run until the outlet air streams and air ducts 3 and 4 (Figure 10A) reached a steady-sate
condition. The exchanger is also considered to be in a dynamic steady
state when the difference between average effectiveness of two consecutive
cycles is less than 1%, which is below the uncertainty limits. To
compare the results with those of a previous report,33 120 s was used a period for one cycle, which is equivalent
to 0.5 rpm.
