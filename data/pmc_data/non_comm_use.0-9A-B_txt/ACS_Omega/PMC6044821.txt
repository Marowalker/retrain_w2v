In this paper, cellular management of fluorescent
nanodiamonds (FNDs) has been studied for better understanding in the
design for potential applications of FNDs in biomedicine. The FNDs
have shown to be photostable probes for bioimaging and thus are well-suited,
for example, long-term tracking purposes. The FNDs also exhibit good
biocompatibility and, in general, low toxicity for cell labeling.
To demonstrate the underlying mechanism of cells coping the low but
potentially toxic effects by nondegradable FNDs, we have studied their
temporal intracellular trafficking. The FNDs were observed to be localized
as distinct populations inside cells in early endosomes, lysosomes,
and in proximity to the plasma membrane. The localization of FNDs
in early endosomes suggests the internalization of FNDs, and lysosomal
localization, in turn, can be interpreted as a prestate for exocytosis
via lysosomal degradation pathway. The endocytosis and exocytosis
appear to be occurring simultaneously in our observations. The mechanism
of continuous endocytosis and exocytosis of FNDs could be necessary
for cells to maintain normal proliferation. Furthermore, 120 h cell
growth assay was performed to verify the long-term biocompatibility
of FNDs for cellular studies.

Introduction
Fluorescent nanodiamonds
(FNDs) are a promising class of carbon-based
nanomaterials.1 The FNDs have exhibited
potential applications in multidisciplinary sciences, especially in
biomedicine.2 They have been studied for
their potential applications, for example, for drug delivery, as nanosensors,
bioimaging, and several other areas of biomedicine.3,4 The
FNDs have shown to possess unique optical properties for bioimaging5,6 because they contain high density of negatively charged nitrogen
vacancies (NV–) rendering them with optical properties
that make them exploitable as photostable fluorescent markers for
single photon,7 multiphoton,8 and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy,9 as well as small animal bioimaging.10 A single NV– has an optical
absorption maxima at 560 nm and broad emission range of 670–800
nm,11 corresponding to nearly optimal spectral
range in view of bioimaging needs and requirements.

The biocompatability
of FNDs in cells has been thoroughly studied
on different cell lines (in vitro)12−15 and in animal studies (in vivo).8,16−19 In vitro studies have reported that FNDs do not appear to significantly
affect the cell differentiation, cell cycle progression, protein expression,
or proliferation.4 In vivo toxicity studies
have been performed on rabbits, mice, zebrafish, and Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Mohan et al. reported on a comprehensive study of in vivo toxicity
and imaging of FNDs in C. elegans.10 Experimental observations with C. elegans have shown no detrimental effects on reproduction
potential and longevity. Puzyr et al. conducted a long-term study for 3–6
months in mice by substituting water in diet and replacing it with
nanodiamond hydrosols to investigate the effects on mice health. The
experimental results have shown that nanodiamonds neither induce mortality
nor affect the normal internal organ growth.16 However, based on mice model studies, the level of toxicity can
be dependent on dosage, surface functionalization, and routes of administration.4,20

Cellular internalization of FNDs is reported to be driven
predominantly
by energy-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis.21 The FNDs have shown overall good biocompatibility
with cells.4,7,12 Despite the
remarkable biocompatibility and cellular uptake shown by FNDs, diamonds
are well-known to be one of the hardest and nondegradable material.
It is still a puzzling phenomenon to observe normal cellular proliferation
and growth even in the presence of FNDs. Therefore, investigating
the cellular mechanism of FND management could provide significant
understanding of the biocompatibility of the material. Comprehensive
study of FND interaction with cells might be vital also for understanding
the biological behavior of other nondegradable materials, for example,
nanoscopic-pollutants.

In our present work, we have studied
the intracellular trafficking
of FNDs by fluorescence and electron microscopy. We started investigating
the temporal translocation dynamics of FNDs in cells. In our study,
we used FNDs without any surface functionalization to understand their
cellular fate in the native state of the particle. We selected early
endosomal antigen-1 (EEA1) as a marker for preliminary route of uptake
in cells via early endosomes. We investigated FND localization with
early endosomes at different time points (2–48 h) and subsequently
analyzed their lysosomal localization (2–48 h) for corresponding
time points. Electron microscopy was employed to investigate subcellular
localization. The electron microscopy studies also allowed the investigation
of distinct localization and visualization of any FND exocytosis or
endocytosis from cells. Experimental verification of exocytosis was
performed with coculture studies. Long-term biocompatibility was performed
with a 120 h cell viability assay.

Results and Discussion
Intracellular
Trafficking of FNDs
An early endosomal
marker (EEA1) was used as an internalization “coordinate”
marker for FNDs in cells. The FND colocalization with early endosomes
(2–48 h) was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure S1). Initial observation after 2 h internalization
suggested that FND uptake in cells was mainly confined around early
endosomes (Figure 1a). Nonfunctionalized FNDs were seen to be internalized as smaller
aggregates (Figure S2). The FNDs were observed
to be localized in early endosomes, and some early endosomes can also
be seen without FNDs. Localization in early endosomes was again observed
at 6 h. Confinement in large endosomal aggregates at 6 h was observed
(Figure 1b). The aggregates
were approximately 1.5–2 μm in size as observed by fluorescence
microscopy (Figure 1b). After 6 h, we started to observe two distinct populations of
FNDs in single cells. A major FND population mainly aggregated in
early endosomes, whereas a second widely dispersed population of FNDs
was observed lying outside of the early endosomes. These two distinct
FND populations were again observed after 24 h (Figure 1c). The size of early endosome-confined FNDs
was approximately 2.5–3 μm in size at 24 h (Figure S3a). The majority of FND aggregates at
this time was no longer bound to early endosomes. In addition to the
aggregates, a distinct and scattered FND population was observed in
proximity to the plasma membrane. The FNDs localized near the cell
membrane were generally scattered and less aggregated as compared
to the early endosome-bound FNDs (Figure S3b,c). After 48 h, the FNDs localized with early endosomes at 48 h were
less than that observed at 24 h. The size of early endosome-confined
FNDs at 48 h was slightly larger than that observed during 6 and 24
h (Figure 1d). However,
compared with overall internalized FND population, the early endosome-confined
FNDs represent a smaller fraction. There are also reported cases of
FND endosomal escape.22 There are possibilities
of endosomal escape of FNDs over time and the notion that FND endocytosis
eventually gets slower at longer time points (48 h) as compared to
earlier time points (6 and 24 h). The early endosomal localization
of FND at 48 h appears to be recently endocytosed FNDs. We also observed
a population of FNDs in the form of large-size aggregates that was
not confined to early endosomes. Scattered FNDs were again observed
close to the cell membrane (Figures 1d and S4).

Figure 1 (a–d) Temporal
localization of FNDs in cells by EEA1. (a)
After 2 h incubation, FNDs (red) are seen within the early endosomes
(green) and in the cytoplasm (blue-nuclei). Some early endosomes do
not contain any FNDs. (b) After 6 h, FNDs were seen localized in the
early endosomes forming large aggregates. Another FND population was
observed to be not early endosome-bound, forming smaller aggregates
and localized more dispersed in cells. (c) After 24 h, three distinct
populations of FNDs were observed: FNDs co-localized with early endosomes,
FNDs aggregated but not bound to early endosomes and a dispersed population
of FNDs, which were mainly localized in proximity to the plasma membrane
(arrow). (d) After 48 h, a small but significant population of FNDs
is localized in the early endosomes. Larger population of FNDs were
not bound to early endosomes but remained clustered and dispersed
in proximity to the plasma membrane (arrow). (e–h) Live cell
microscopy of FND localization with lysosomes (2–48 h). (e)
After 2 h internalization, FNDs (red) can be seen mainly outside of
lysosomes (green). (f) After 6 h, a population of FNDs co-localized
with lysosomes. Another population was aggregated but nonconfined
to lysosomes, and some lysosomes were seen without any FNDs. (g) After
24 h, one population of FNDs was aggregated and colocalized with lysosomes,
and another distinct, dispersed FND population was observed mainly
at the edges of the plasma membrane. (h) After 48 h, progressive colocalization
of FNDs with lysosomes was observed. A distinct and dispersed population
of FNDs was seen localized in proximity to the plasma membrane.

In a classical endocytosis process,
the endosomes mature from early
endosomes to late endosomes and finally fuse to lysosome-based degradation
pathway. Therefore, we investigated the full lysosomal localization
of nondegradable FNDs to study their subsequent fate (Figure S5). We used live-cell LysoTracker dye
to label and track lysosomes. After 2 h incubation of live cells with
FNDs, the particles were mainly seen outside of lysosomes (Figure 1e). The observation
suggests that FNDs were localized in compartments other than lysosomes.
The FNDs were observed to be mostly spread across the cells. Significant
observation was made at 6 h incubation of cells with FNDs (Figure 1f). We observed a
population of FNDs colocalizing with lysosomes. Another FND population
was aggregated but not colocalized with lysosomes and lysosomes without
any FNDs (Figure 1f).
The observation suggests that only a part of FND population were inside
of lysosomes. Therefore, a significant population was localized in
other cellular compartments. At 24 h time point, we observed again
three clearly distinct populations of FNDs in cells (Figure S6): aggregated FNDs colocalized with lysosomes, FNDs
not colocalized with lysosomes, and a scattered population of FNDs
in proximity to the plasma membrane. We had observed a similar localization
of FNDs in proximity to the plasma membrane with EEA1-labeled cells
(Figure 1c) at 24 h.
The scattered FND population in proximity to the plasma membrane were
associated neither with EEA1 nor with lysosomes (Figure 1c,g), thus, suggesting that
these scattered FNDs could be ready to be exocytosed from cells. At
48 h (Figure 1h), some
FNDs were colocalized with lysosomes forming large aggregates measuring
up to 2–3 μm in size. Some lysosomes can be seen with
few FNDs. Another consistent observation was the localization of FNDs
in proximity to the plasma membrane (Figure S7). In summary, the FNDs were observed to be localized and present
in different cellular compartments, such as the FNDs confined to early
endosomes, the FNDs confined to lysosomes, and the scattered FNDs
localized in proximity to the plasma membrane.

FND Management by Cells
The result of FND colocalization
with early endosomes and lysosomes (Figure 1) can be interpreted as one population of
FNDs that are localized either with early endosomes (Figure 1b–d) or lysosomes (Figure 1f–h) at 6,
24, and 48 h time points. However, another significant FND population
was mainly located close to the plasma membrane. The FND localization
(2–48 h) to EEA1 could be interpreted as continuous endocytosis
of FNDs in cells (Figure 1a–d). However, continuous endocytosis of FNDs would
finally lead to the accumulation of FNDs in cells. The FND accumulation
could be speculated to cause adverse effects on cell proliferation
and perhaps lead to cellular toxicity. However, we observed no adverse
effects on cell growth in 120 h experiment of culturing cells with
FNDs (Figure S8). The FNDs have previously
been reported to be nontoxic.4,7,12 The consistent observation of FND localization with lysosomes at
6–48 h time points suggests that FNDs have to be exocytosed
from cells. Therefore, it is logical to argue that exocytosis and
endocytosis of FNDs are simultaneously occurring processes in cells.
The cells could be using this mechanism to avoid possible toxicity
induced by nondegradable FNDs.

The demonstration of FND exocytosis
was performed with coculture cell studies. The FND-labeled eGFP MDA-MB-231
cells were cocultured with cancerous (HeLa and nonGFP MDA-MB-231)
and noncancerous cells lines (HSF and MEF). The eGFP-expressing MDA-MB-231
cells were first cultured with FNDs for 6 h to facilitate FND internalization.
The culture medium was then changed to one not-containing FNDs and HeLa; nonGFP MDA-MB-231,
HSF, or MEF cells were seeded to the coculture. After 48 h of coculturing,
a significant fraction of FNDs were exocytosed from GFP MDA-MB-231
and internalized by cells in the coculture (Figure 2a–d).

cells. FNDs (red) exocytose
from eGFP MDA-MB-231 cells were internalized (arrow) to other cells
in coculture. (a) HeLa cell, (b) HSF, (c) nonGFP MDA-MB-231 cells,
and (d) MEF cells.

Distribution of Vesicle-Bound
and Peripheral FNDs
FNDs
were earlier observed by fluorescence microscopy to form two visibly
distinct populations: vesicle-confined FND (endosomal, lysosomal)
and scattered FNDs that were mainly located in proximity to the plasma
membrane (Figure 1).
Electron microscopy verified (Figure 3a,b) that after 24 h, FNDs were mostly localized in
the vesicular space (green arrow) or near the plasma membrane (orange
arrow). There was a progressive aggregation of FNDs seen in the vesicular
space (Figure 3c,d)
at 48 h internalization. Vesicles were mostly packed with FNDs, and
the size of the aggregates was approximately 1–2 μm as
observed using a transmission electron microscope (Figure 3d).

Figure 3 Electron microscopy reveals
localization of intracellular (green
arrow) and extracellular (orange arrow) FNDs. (a,b) After 24 h cellular
internalization, FNDs are found in vesicles and in proximity to the
plasma membrane. (c,d) After 48 h, FNDs were mostly confined to the
vesicular space in the form of aggregates. (e,f) Images at 72 h internalization
suggest a possible event of exocytosis (Figure 3e) of FNDs from the cell and show the confinement
of FNDs in the vesicular space (Figure 3f). (g,h) 96 h observation showing again the vesicular
confinement of FNDs. (i) 120 h observation suggesting fusion of vesicles
to form multivesicular bodies filled with FNDs. (j) Presence of extracellular
FNDs (orange arrow) also observed at 120 h in another cell. (k,l)
Control cells showing empty vesicles.

In one individual observation, after 72 h of FND internalization,
we observed an FND-packed vesicle that may be leading to exocytosis
of FNDs from the cell (Figure 3e). The vesicles were localized on the extreme edge of the
plasma membrane. We suspect it to be off-loading the vesicular content
in the extracellular space. However, other FNDs remained confined
to the vesicular space (Figure 3e,f). Also during longer investigation time points (96 and
120 h), we had similar observations of FNDs being mostly confined
to the vesicular space in an aggregated manner (Figure 3g–j). We did not observe the interaction
of FNDs with cellular organelles such as nuclei, mitochondria, or
Golgi (Figure S9). The FNDs localized in
the vesicular spaces were aggregated and distinct from the empty vesicle
of control cells (Figure 3k,l). The dark spots present in the TEM images were observed
to be seen with both FND-containing cells and control cells. The darks
spots are mostly spherical and easily distinguishable from FNDs (Figure S10). The TEM imaging of FNDs in cells
confirms the presence of two distinct FND populations: one being aggregated
and confined to the vesicular space and the other being mostly dispersed
near the plasma membrane.

Conclusions
The
fluorescence microscopy study presented suggests that significant
populations of cellular FNDs were localized within early endosomes
and lysosomes at the same time (6, 24, and 48 h). These observations
imply that cells could be regulating the FND population by continuous
endocytosis and exocytosis. This could be a rational mechanism for
the cells to overcome the potential toxic effects of nondegradable
FNDs. The observations with fluorescence microscopy in combination
with TEM can be concluded as the presence of distinct FND populations
in cells. The FNDs were mainly localized with: (1) early endosome-confined
FNDs, (2) lysosome-confined FNDs, and (3) FNDs localized in proximity
to the cell membrane. The vesicle bound FNDs (early endosomal and
lysosomal) were mostly aggregates. The sizes of the vesicular-bound
FND aggregates were roughly up to 2 μm, and the fusion of vesicles
to even larger multivesicular bodies was observed. The FNDs localized
in proximity to the plasma membrane were more dispersed and less aggregated.
The proximal FNDs are suggested to be those being exocytosed from
the cells. The exocytosis of FNDs was demonstrated with coculture
studies. In summary, this study proposes new insights for understanding
the FND interaction with human cells and could explain possible mechanisms
for management of nondegradable FNDs.

Experimental Section
Fluorescent
Nanodiamonds
The FNDs (∼100 nm in
diameter) were produced by radiation damage of synthetic type-Ib diamond
powders (micron + MDA, element six) with 40 keV He+, followed
by vacuum annealing at 800 °C for 2 h, air oxidation at 450 °C
for 1 h, and acid wash in concentrated H2SO4/HNO3 (3:1, v/v) at 100 °C for 3 h.23 They are well-established as bright and photostable and
are reported for various biological applications.3,10,23 The material synthesis, characterization,
and imaging potential have been reported by Chang et al., 2008.23

Live Cell Imaging of Lysosomal-Localized
FNDs
The MDA-MB-231
(human breast adenocarcinoma) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 2mM l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
(v/v). The FND particles (10 μg/mL) were prepared in 1 mL of
cell growth media. The MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with FNDs (10
μg/mL) at different time points (2, 6, 24, and 48 h). The medium
(0.5 mL) was collected from the plate and mixed with 0.6 μL
of LysoTracker Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) and added
back to the media drop-by-drop to the plate. The cells were finally
incubated for 20 min in 37 °C incubator. Before imaging, regular
DMEM with supplements [10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM l-glutamine,
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (v/v)] were added to the cells.
The live cell microscopy setup consisted of a Leica TCS SP5 STED (Leica
Microsystems, Germany) instrument, LASAF software (Leica application
suite), photomultiplier tube (PMT), and 63× water objective.
The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 during
live cell microscopy measurements. LysoTracker Green and the FNDs
were excited using an argon laser of 488 nm.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy
of EEA1-Bound FNDs
The
MDA-MB-231 cells (human breast adenocarcinoma) were cultured as described
above. The FND particles (10 μg/mL) were prepared in 1 mL of
cell growth media. The cells were fixed at 2, 6, 24, and 48 h to investigate
early endosomal localization. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) for 10 min. The cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100
for 10 min and blocked with horse serum. A 1° anti EEA1 antibody
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, USA) was prepared (1:100) in PBS (10%
horse serum). Antibody conjugation was performed overnight at +4 °C.
The cells were washed three times with PBS; Alexa 488 secondary antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich, US) in PBS was added to the cells at RT for 1 h. The
cells were mounted over coverslips with VECTASHIELD (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).
The microscopy setup consisted of a Leica TCS SP5 STED (Leica Microsystems,
Germany) instrument, LASAF software (Leica application suite), PMT,
and 100× oil objective. Alexa 488 and the FNDs were excited using
an argon laser of 488 nm.

Electron Microscopy of Subcellular Localized
FNDs
The
MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with FNDs (10 μg/mL) for respective
time points (24–120 h). Then, the cells were fixed with 5%
glutaraldehyde s-collidine buffer, postfixed with
2% OsO4 containing 3% potassium ferrocyanide, dehydrated
with ethanol, and flat embedded in a 45359 Fluka Epoxy Embedding Medium
kit. Thin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome to a thickness
of 70 nm. The sections were stained using uranyl acetate and lead
citrate to enable detection using TEM. The sections were examined
using a JEOL JEM-1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operated
at 80 kV acceleration voltage.

Exocytosis of FNDs (CoCulture
Studies)
The MDA-MB-231
eGFP-expressing cells were incubated with 10 μg/mL FNDs for
6 h. Then, these cells were cocultured with different cell lines without
FND incubation such as HeLa (human cervical cancer cells), MDA-MB-231
nonGFP (human breast adenocarcinoma), HSF (human skin fibroblasts),
and MEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) cells. The cells were fixed
with 4% PFA for 10 min after 48 h coculturing. The cocultured cells
were imaged using a confocal microscope. The microscope setup consisted
of a Leica TCS SP5 STED (Leica Microsystems, Germany) instrument,
LASAF software (Leica application suite), PMT and 100× oil objective.
The GFP and the FNDs were excited using an argon laser of 488 nm.
