A new approach to sensing and imaging
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was developed using
microcapsule-based dual-emission
ratiometric luminescent biosensors. Bovine serum albumin-capped gold
nanoclusters (BSA-AuNCs) sensitive to H2O2 were
coencapsulated with insensitive FluoSpheres (FSs) within polymeric
capsules fabricated via the layer-by-layer method. Under single-wavelength
excitation, the microcapsule-based biosensors exhibited emission bands
at ∼516 and ∼682 nm resulting from the FSs and BSA-AuNCs,
respectively. The polyelectrolyte multilayers lining the microcapsules
were effective in protecting BSA-AuNCs from the degradation catalyzed
by proteases (chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and proteinase K) and
subsequent luminescent quenching, overcoming a key limitation of prior
BSA-AuNC-based sensing systems. The luminescent response of the sensors
was also found to be independent of local changes in pH (5–9).
Quenching of the AuNCs in the presence of H2O2 enabled the spectroscopic quantification and imaging of changes
in H2O2 concentration from 0 to 1 mM. The microcapsule
sensors were easily phagocytized by murine macrophage cells (RAW 264.7),
were effective as intracellular H2O2 imaging
probes, and were successfully used to detect local release of H2O2 in response to an external chemical stimulus.

1 Introduction
Detection
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has
received extensive attention due to its relevance in chemical, environmental,
clinical, and biological applications.1,2 H2O2 is a reactive oxygen species and an important metabolite
in living systems acting as a biomarker for oxidative stress and an
indicator of cell damage.3,4 Over the years, it has
also been established that H2O2 is of paramount
importance for cellular signal transduction pathways.5,6 In mammals, H2O2 has been associated with
triggering immune cell response cascades and remodeling injured vasculature.7 Physiological levels of H2O2 fluctuate in the micromolar range, and under pathological conditions,
H2O2 concentrations may rise to millimolar levels.8,9 Additionally, H2O2 is released as a by-product
of several enzymatic reactions, which enables the indirect detection
of the reaction substrates by monitoring fluctuations in H2O2 levels.1,10 The multifaceted role of H2O2 in biochemical processes has motivated research
to quantify and image cellular H2O2 concentrations
using small-molecule fluorescent probes,8,11−14 nanoparticles,15−17 and recombinant fluorescent proteins.18−20

Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) have emerged as a promising tool
for
biosensing and bioimaging applications owing to their high quantum
yield, large Stokes shift, photo- and chemical stability, nanosize,
and low toxicity.21−23 AuNCs are usually capped by a protein or chemical
ligand to enhance the structural stability and photoluminescence characteristics.24,25 The bovine serum albumin (BSA)-mediated biomineralization technique
to fabricate luminescent AuNCs entrapped within BSA (BSA-AuNCs) has
gained popularity due to its moderately high quantum yield, long wavelength
emission, surface modification capabilities, and facile synthesis
using mild reaction conditions. The BSA scaffold covalently interacts
with the AuNCs and provides steric shielding, enhancing the structural
stability of the AuNCs that in turn engenders highly stable luminescence
over a broad range of pH and salt concentrations.26 Prior studies have shown that the luminescence of BSA-AuNCs
is sensitive to H2O2, potentially offering a
cheaper and nontoxic alternative to commercially available H2O2 quantification systems (e.g., o-dianisidine,
tetramethylbenzidine, and 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid)).
To further take advantage of H2O2-mediated quenching
of BSA-AuNCs, a number of optical sensing assays for analytes including
glucose, cholesterol, and acetylcholine have been developed by combining
BSA-AuNCs and substrate-specific enzymes.27−29 However, protease-induced
enzymatic degradation of the BSA scaffold can also affect the luminescence
of BSA-AuNCs,30,31 which poses a problem for the
use of BSA-AuNC-enabled sensors to detect small-molecule analytes
(e.g., H2O2, glucose, lactate, etc.) in complex
biological samples.

In this work, microcapsules containing BSA-AuNCs
and FluoSpheres
(FSs) are introduced as H2O2 sensors with two
key features overcoming the limitations of nonencapsulated BSA-AuNCs:
(1) the capsules protect the BSA-AuNCs from detrimental interactions
with the external environment and (2) the incorporation of FSs with
complementary emission spectra facilitates ratiometric luminescence
intensity measurements. Micro- and nano-sized polymeric capsules fabricated
with the layer-by-layer (LbL) method have been shown as effective
carriers for optical indicators in biosensing applications32−34 due to the semipermeable nature of the polyelectrolyte multilayer
(PEM) films. These LbL nanofilms physically confine the sensing reagents,
allowing selective permeability of small molecules while excluding
larger macromolecules and proteins.35−37 In this case, the capsules
shield BSA-AuNCs from damaging proteases while permitting the free
entry of the analyte (H2O2).

The photostable
FSs are unaffected by changes in pH38 and
therefore serve as a highly effective reference
material when they are used in combination with BSA-AuNCs to monitor
changes in H2O2. Such an intensity reference
enables ratiometric measurements by reducing the influence of nonspecific
effects on sensor response such as excitation source intensity fluctuations,
variations in sensor concentration, and sample scattering; this is
imperative for intensity-based in vivo and intracellular measurements
where there are numerous interfering factors. There have been a few
prior examples of BSA-AuNC-based ratiometric sensors that take advantage
of intrinsic blue emission from oxidized BSA or emission from fluorescein-isothiocyanate
(FITC) covalently tagging the amine groups of BSA.39−43 The FITC-tagged sensors exhibit strong pH sensitivity,
potentially making them susceptible to errors in tracking H2O2 fluctuations. Herein, the response of the FS- and BSA-AuNC-containing
microcapsule sensors to changes in H2O2 was
evaluated and for the first time the use of these ratiometric microcapsule-based
sensors to image H2O2 in murine RAW 264.7 macrophage
cells was demonstrated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Chemicals
Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), calcium chloride (CaCl2), BSA,
α-chymotrypsin from bovine pancreas, trypsin from bovine pancreas,
papain from papaya latex, proteinase K from Tritirachium
album, gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS, average MW 70 000
Da), poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC, average MW 100 000–200 000
Da), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), poly(vinylsulfonic acid)
(PVSA), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal
bovine serum (FBS), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), buffer salts (NaHCO3, HEPES, CHES, and CH3COONa), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Carboxylate-modified,
0.02 μm, yellow-green (505/515) FSs were obtained from Thermo
Fisher Scientific.

2.2 Fabrication of H2O2-Sensing
Polymeric Microcapsules
BSA-AuNCs were fabricated using the
green one-pot synthesis method described elsewhere.26 Briefly, 1 mL of aqueous BSA (50 mg/mL), 1 mL of HAuCl4 (10 mM), and 100 μL of NaOH (1 M) were mixed and stirred
moderately for 12 h at 37 °C. The resulting AuNC solution was
mixed with FSs (0.78 nM) and 0.2 M Na2CO3 to
obtain a final volume of 9 mL while maintaining the volume ratio 66:3:95.
To the mixture, 9 mL of 0.16 M CaCl2 was added and allowed
to react for 10 min at 25 °C while being stirred rapidly (800
rpm). PVSA (225 μL, 25 wt % in H2O) was also added
to the mixture, 2 min after the start of the reaction. PEMs were coated
onto the BSA-AuNC/FS-loaded CaCO3 microparticles as described
elsewhere.37 Briefly, microparticles were
alternately suspended in 2 mL of PDADMAC (20 mg/mL, pH 8) and PSS
(20 mg/mL, pH 8) for 2 min, followed by centrifugation at 500g to remove excess polyelectrolytes. After each polyelectrolyte
deposition step, the particles were resuspended in 2 mL of NaHCO3 (5 mM, pH 8) to get rid of loosely bound polyelectrolytes.
This sequence of polyelectrolyte deposition and washing was repeated
until 10 bilayers were deposited. To quantify the loading efficiency,
a fraction of the cargo-loaded microparticles was exposed to EDTA
(0.2 M, pH 7.2) to release encapsulated materials.32,44 The relative amount of BSA-AuNCs and FSs released (loading efficiency)
was calculated by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 682 and
516 nm, respectively, when excited at 445 nm and using calibration
curves obtained from known concentrations of BSA-AuNCs and FSs. Finally,
hollow microcapsules were made by suspending the PEM-coated CaCO3 microparticles containing BSA-AuNCs/FSs in the EDTA solution
(0.2 M, pH 7.2) for 1 h, followed by washing with NaHCO3 (5 mM, pH 8). The zeta potential was measured using a Malvern ZetaSizer
Nano Series ZEN 3600 spectrometer.

2.3 Sensitivity
of Sensors to Proteases and to
pH Variation
Nonencapsulated BSA-AuNCs (10 μL from
the prepared stock) or encapsulated BSA-AuNCs/FSs ratiometric sensors
(made from 0.67 mg of LbL coated microparticles) were added to the
protease solution (1 mg/mL in PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for
4 h. The control experiments were similarly conducted in the absence
of proteases. The relative sensor response R/R0 was calculated, where R and R0 represent BSA-AuNC luminescence intensities
in the presence and absence of proteases, respectively. To evaluate
the sensitivity of the ratiometric sensors to pH, microcapsules were
suspended in CH3COONa (5 mM, pH 5), HEPES (5 mM, pH 7),
and CHES (5 mM, pH 9) for 2 h at 37 °C. Photoluminescence measurements
were performed using Tecan Infinite M200 PRO with i-Control 1.8 software.
Samples contained in black 96-well plates were excited at 445 nm to
collect emission spectra from 500 to 800 nm.

2.4 Sample
Preparation for Sensing H2O2
Microcapsule
sensors fabricated by dissolving
0.67 mg of PEM-coated microparticles were incubated for 30 min at
37 °C in different concentrations of H2O2 (0–1000 μM, 100 μL). H2O2 solutions were prepared using PBS, and the photoluminescence response
of the sensors at each H2O2 concentration was
measured. The response time of the sensors when exposed to H2O2 was computed by evaluating the time required for the
response ratio to drop by 63.2% from the initial ratio.45 The limit of detection (LOD) and maximum observable
peroxide concentration (MOPC) were calculated by determining the H2O2 concentrations at R516/682(min) + 3σ and R516/682(max) –
3σ, respectively, where R516/682(min) is the sensor response at 0 μM H2O2, R516/682(max) is the sensor response at 1000
μM H2O2, and σ is the standard error
of the response across three separate sensor batches. The analytical
range was calculated as range = MOPC – LOD, and the sensor
sensitivity was computed using the following equation: S = {[R516/682(max) – R516/682(min)]/R516/682(min) × 100}/range.

2.5 Cell Culture
Murine
macrophage cells
(RAW 264.7) were cultured in DMEM, containing high glucose concentration
and 10% FBS. The cell cultures were split (1/6) twice a week. A day
before incubating the cells with the microcapsule sensors, the cells
were passaged and seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/dish
in 35 mm glass bottom dishes (Cellvis). For all sensor-response experiments,
the cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with
microcapsule sensors (fabricated from 6.7 mg of PEM-coated microparticles)
for 1 h. However, the cells were incubated with the sensors for 24
h for the cell vitality assay analysis. Before imaging, all cells
were moderately washed with PBS to remove unbound cells and excess
microcapsule sensors. PMA (1 mg/mL stock) and H2O2 (10 mM stock) were directly added to cell culture media and incubated
for 30 min before imaging. For cell vitality assay experiments, the
cells were incubated with 3 mL of PBS containing calcein AM (2 μM)
and ethidium homodimer (1 μM) for 15 min.

2.6 Confocal Imaging
All confocal and
differential interference contrast (DIC) images of samples were obtained
using an inverted microscope (Olympus IX81) having a spinning disk
confocal unit (Yokogawa CSU-X1) and attached to an iXon897 electron-multiplying
charge-coupled device camera (Andor Technology). For confocal imaging,
samples were viewed with a 40× oil immersion objective (1.3 NA)
and excited using a 445 nm laser. Fluorescence images of FSs and BSA-AuNCs
were captured using 525/15 nm band-pass and 633 nm long-pass emission
filters, respectively. To image the response of microcapsule sensors
to varying concentrations of H2O2, 10 μL
of the microcapsule suspension was dropped on a cover slip for imaging.
Confocal images of macrophages were obtained directly in glass bottom
dishes. The mean luminescence intensity values were calculated from
the images of the FSs and BSA-AuNC emission channels; sensor response
ratios were generated by dividing the FS mean intensity by the BSA-AuNC
average intensity values. Pseudocolored images were obtained by dividing
the FSs pixel intensities by the BSA-AuNCs pixel intensities. All
images were analyzed using ImageJ software. Sensor parameters were
calculated from mean sensor intensity ratios.

3 Results and Discussion
Microcapsule-based ratiometric hydrogen
peroxide sensors (Scheme 1A) were fabricated
by coecapsulating H2O2 sensitive BSA-AuNCs (Scheme 1B) and H2O2-insensitive FSs (Scheme 1C). These materials have spectrally separate emission
spectra but overlapping excitation spectra,26,38 which enables the use of a single excitation source to simultaneously
excite both materials and generate dual emission. Figure 1A depicts the individual emission
spectra of the FSs and the BSA-AuNCs along with the emission spectra
of the microcapsule sensors containing both the FSs and the BSA-AuNCs.
When excited at 445 nm the microcapsule sensors exhibited dual emission
with peaks centered at 516 and 682 nm, which are similar to those
observed when illuminating FSs and AuNCs separately. The loading efficiency
of BSA-AuNCs and FSs was estimated to be ∼53 and ∼20%,
respectively; proteins (BSA) act as additives during the nucleation
process and are more readily adsorbed onto the surface of the primary
nanocrystallites that ultimately combine to form the highly porous
CaCO3 microstructure, resulting in higher encapsulation.46 As estimated from analysis of confocal images
(Figure S1), the mean diameter of the microcapsule
sensors was ∼7 μm. Furthermore, the number of FSs and
BSA-AuNCs in each microcapsule was assessed to be 2 × 1010 and 7.18 × 108 respectively. When suspended
in buffer solution (0.01 M NaHCO3, pH 8) the microcapsule
sensors were well dispersed and showed no visible signs of aggregation;
zeta potential measurement revealed that the PEM-coated microcapsules
had a high surface charge (−70.3 ± 1.4 mV) corroborating
their colloidal stability.

respectively. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for three
separate batches of sensors.

Prior studies have demonstrated that degradation of the
BSA shell
via protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptide bonds decreases BSA-AuNC
luminescence intensity,30,31 thereby rendering the
sensors ineffective in reporting peroxide changes in the presence
of proteases found in many biological systems. We hypothesized that
protecting the BSA-AuNCs within LbL microcapsules would protect against
this degradation and preserve function of the BSA-AuNC in peroxide
response. The ability of PEMs to exclude damaging proteases and prevent
quenching of the BSA-AuNCs was assessed by exposing the sensors to
common proteases (chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and proteinase K).
Nonencapsulated BSA-AuNCs showed ∼55, ∼44, ∼37,
and ∼64% loss in luminescence when exposed to chymotrypsin,
trypsin, papain, and proteinase K respectively (Figure 1B). In contrast, BSA-AuNCs encapsulated in
PEM-lined microcapsules retained their luminescence intensities (∼100%)
when exposed to the same proteases, (Figure 1B) indicating that PEMs exclude proteases
and protect the luminescent reporters. Furthermore, we found no significant
difference (p > 0.05) in luminescence of coecapsulated
FSs and BSA-AuNCs when incubated in different pH (5, 7, 9) solutions
(Figure 2); confirming
that the coecapsulated FSs serve as a more robust reference material
than pH-sensitive organic dyes such as FITC.

of microcapsule sensors at different pH, normalized
to (A) BSA-AuNC peak (682 nm) and (B) FSs peak (516 nm). Error bars
represent 95% confidence intervals for three separate batches of microcapsule
sensors.

The microcapsule sensors responded
rapidly to the exposure of H2O2, with a mean
response time of ∼9 min.
The change in response of the microcapsule sensors at varying concentrations
of H2O2 was evaluated; as seen in Figure 3A an increase in H2O2 concentration decreased the emission of the BSA-AuNCs
progressively, while the emission of the FSs remained relatively constant.
By plotting the intensity ratios (I516/I682) against H2O2 concentrations (Figure 3B), two distinct linear regions in ranges 0–200 μM
(R2 = 0.98) and 200–1000 μM
(R2 = 0.98) were observed. These findings
are similar to the quenching profiles reported previously for BSA-AuNCs.27,39 The average LOD, MOPC, analytical range, and sensitivity per unit
range were ∼26.20 μM, ∼858.5 μM, ∼832.7
μM, and ∼0.2%/μM, respectively. Subsequently, these
sensors were imaged using confocal microscopy at various H2O2 concentrations. Microcapsules were incubated in different
H2O2 concentrations and were imaged to obtain
average luminescence intensity ratios. Figure 3D–F shows the representative pseudocolored
images of microcapsules at 0, 400, and 1000 μM H2O2, respectively. Figure 3D is predominantly blue, characteristic to a low mean
intensity ratio (0.56 ± 0.04), whereas Figure 3F has a mixture of yellow-red microcapsules
representing a higher mean ratio (1.58 ± 0.06) and Figure 3E has a green microcapsule
population with an intermediate mean ratio (1.25 ± 0.03). By
plotting the mean intensity ratios acquired from confocal imaging
against H2O2 concentrations, a response curve
(Figure 3C) analogous
to that obtained using the plate reader was obtained. Similar to Figure 3B, Figure 3C reveals a ratiometric response
with two separate linear regions spanning 0–200 μM (R2 = 0.99) and 200–1000 μM (R2 = 0.97). The average LOD, MOPC, analytical
range, and sensitivity per unit range were found to be ∼34.90
μM, ∼619.8 μM, ∼584.9 μM, and ∼0.3%/μM,
respectively; the differences between the calculated sensor parameters
from the data acquired using spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy
are ascribed to the differences in the optical setups used to collect
data.

using a microplate spectrophotometer and (C) obtained using ratiometric
images of microcapsules. Confocal, ratiometric fluorescence images

images represent the ratio of emission intensities collected using
a 510–540 nm band-pass filter and a 633 nm long-pass filter,
when excited at 445 nm. The scale bars correspond to 20 μm.
The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals for at least three
separate samples of microcapsule sensors.

Next, the microcapsule-based H2O2 sensors
were used to obtain ratiometric luminescent images of biological specimens.
Confocal and DIC images of RAW 264.7 macrophages incubated with microcapsule
sensors for 1 h indicated that the microcapsules were rapidly and
effectively ingested by the cells (Figure 4A–F). In comparison with macrophages
that had not been incubated with microcapsules (Figure 4F inset), the microcapsule-containing macrophages
appear to be granular when viewed using DIC; this is ascribed to local
optical-path gradients introduced by the internalized microcapsules.
Using standard cell vitality assays, it was confirmed that the viability
of the cells was unaltered after microcapsule ingestion (Figure S2). The mean intensity ratio (Figure 4G) of the microcapsules
ingested by the cells (Figure 4A) was estimated to be 125% more than the ratio of the microcapsules
that were not ingested (Figure S3B) but
present in the vicinity of the macrophages. The increase in the ratio
is attributed to the inherent H2O2 release by
the macrophages to degrade the phagocytosed foreign materials. Treatment
of the microcapsule-loaded cells with 500 μM H2O2 (Figure 4B)
served as a positive control and triggered an increase in the ratio
(Figure 4G) of both
the microcapsules inside the cells and the microcapsules present outside
(Figure S3D). The response of the extracellular
microcapsules increased by 123%, whereas the sensor response of the
phagocytosed microcapsules increased by 35%. To further demonstrate
the feasibility of the microcapsule-based sensors to detect endogenous
release of H2O2 in response to stimulants, the
sensor-loaded cells were imaged after the cells were stimulated with
PMA (Figure 4C). The
response (Figure 4G)
of the microcapsules outside the cells (Figure S3F) was almost unaltered, whereas the response of the sensors
inside the cells increased by 21%. This provides strong evidence that
the macrophages release endogenous H2O2 in response
to the PMA stimulus, as reported by the internalized sensors, whereas
the external sensors did not respond. These results demonstrate the
benefit of the BSA-AuNC microcapsule ratiometric sensors for imaging
physiological H2O2 and detecting endogenous
bursts of H2O2.

respectively. The scale bars correspond to 30 μm. (G) Ratiometric

These sensing systems may be useful
for studying cell-signaling
mechanisms in live cells. However, it is important to appreciate that
internalization of microcapsules will depend, to a degree, on the
external surface charge they present as well as the specific cells
involved. Therefore, it is worth noting that these microcapsules are
highly tailorable; the types of polyelectrolytes used and the conditions
(e.g., pH, ionic strength) used during fabrication can easily alter
capsule properties. For example, if the intended application mandates
a positive surface charge, the surface charge of our capsules can
be easily changed to positive by switching the outer layer to a cationic
polyelectrolyte (e.g., PDADMAC, poly(allylamine)).

4 Conclusions
A method to fabricate polymeric microcapsule-based
ratiometric
H2O2 sensors was demonstrated using a combination
of BSA-AuNCs and a reference fluorescent nanoparticle. The change
in H2O2 within living macrophage cells was visualized,
and intracellular H2O2 fluctuations in response
to external stimuli were detected. Given the excellent sensitivity
and wide range of response, these sensors may be potentially used
to study cellular signaling pathways that involve low levels of H2O2 generation. The microcapsules offer an inexpensive
and nontoxic method for direct H2O2 detection,
in applications that involve complex biological samples. Ratiometric
sensing facilitates reliable measurements, and the semipermeable nature
of the LbL microcapsule walls protects the BSA-AuNCs from catalytic
enzymes and nonspecifically binding macromolecules. Additionally,
it is noteworthy that BSA-AuNCs have also been used for environmental
monitoring of hazardous materials (e.g., Hg2+, cyanide)42,47,48 and for developing enzymatic
assays that detect other analytes (e.g., glucose, lactate, and choline);
thus, the ratiometric microcapsule-based platform may also be advantageous
for use in similar applications. In future, we will focus on using
these nanomaterial systems as tools to examine endogenous levels of
analytes (e.g., H2O2, glucose, and lactate)
in biological samples and living systems.
