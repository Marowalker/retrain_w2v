Persistently
high plasma levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) may induce
AA amyloidosis in various organs causing their dysfunction. Although
SAA isoforms share a high degree of homology, only the SAA1.1 isoform
is found in amyloid deposits. SAA1.1 misfolding is a nucleation-dependent
process with dimer and trimer formation playing a major role in SAA
fibril formation through self-catalyzed recruitment of native SAA
molecules. Yet, a structural model of initial SAA oligomerization
is still missing. In this study, we constructed a loosely associated
model for murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimers in the presence or absence
of hyaluronic acid as an exemplary glycosaminoglycan, a factor known
to facilitate SAA fibril formation. Molecular dynamics simulations
predicted that hyaluronic acid finally stabilized in a different binding
pocket of the pathogenic SAA1.1 dimer compared to the nonpathogenic
SAA2.2 dimer. Besides, Markov state modeling points to dynamic behavioral
differences between the linker region of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 and identifies
a state unique to pathogenic SAA1.1 while bound to hyaluronic acid.
The presence or absence of hyaluronic acid, as well as the dimer interface
switch, affects dynamic behavior and possible oligomeric states, proposing
a conceivable clue to the deviant pathogenicity of the two SAA isoforms.

==== Body
Introduction
Serum amyloid A (SAA)
is one of the most abundant acute phase proteins.
It binds with high affinity to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and
modulates cholesterol homeostasis. Besides, it can regulate the immune
response and facilitate bacterial clearance.1 In response to inflammatory stimuli caused by pathogen infection
or tissue injury, SAA serum levels can rise up to 1 mg/mL, which is
1000 times higher than normal levels. Persistently high levels of
SAA may cause accumulation of amyloid deposits consisting of highly
ordered β-sheets of misfolded insoluble proteins in major organs.
Such amyloid deposits might lead to organ dysfunction and life-threatening
complications.1,2 Diseases characterized by persistently
high plasma concentrations of SAA, such as rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis,
ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, familial Mediterranean
fever, and Crohn’s disease, are also commonly associated with
the development of AA amyloidosis. Likewise, some tumors can be accompanied
by AA amyloidosis.2

Mature human
SAA is a 104-amino-acid protein synthesized by liver
hepatocytes and released into the circulation in response to stimulation
with proinflammatory cytokines.2 SAA protein
found in amyloid deposits is mainly a C-terminus-truncated SAA1 variant,
which contains a more hydrophobic N-terminal region compared to other
SAA isoforms.1 After truncation, the remaining
N-terminal portion of SAA is unstable and can easily convert from
an α-helix to a β-sheet structure, which is characteristic
for amyloid deposits indicating that the N-terminus represents the
amyloidogenic portion of SAA.2 The structure
of human SAA1 (SAA1.1) was only recently elucidated and shows a hexamer
with two positively charged clusters formed by monomers folded into
a unique antiparallel four-helix bundle with a well-organized C-terminal
tail wrapped around one side of the helix bundle.3

Mature mouse SAA1.1 protein with 103 amino acids
shares 76% sequence
identity with the human SAA1 and is often used for in vivo studies.1,4,5 Similar to human SAA1, which has
a tendency to form pathogenic amyloid fibrils, mouse SAA1.1 is pathogenic
probably due to a proline-rich 13-amino-acid segment in the C-terminus,
whereas mice expressing SAA2.2 are resistant to AA amyloidosis.1

In addition to HDL, SAA interacts also
with carbohydrates known
as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are unbranched polysaccharides
of the extracellular matrix containing repeating motifs of hexosamine
and hexuronic acid disaccharides. GAGs, mostly heparan sulfate, but
also heparin and hyaluronic acid, are commonly found in AA amyloid
deposits.2,6 SAA has specific binding sites for GAGs.
Thus, residues 78–104 of the C-terminus of human SAA bind heparan
sulfate.2 Animals overexpressing heparanase
are resistant to develop AA amyloidosis, pointing to a causative role
of GAGs in SAA aggregation.2 It has been
suggested that due to highly anionic moieties, GAGs may serve as scaffolds
for SAA proteins, facilitating their misfolding.7 Indeed, it has been shown that heparan sulfate displaces
SAA from HDL particles2 and all GAGs enhance
the SAA1.1 aggregation in vitro.7

Amyloid fibrils represent the terminal state of a complex self-assembly
process of initial monomers. It is generally accepted that formation
of amyloid fibrils is a nucleation-dependent event, and the aggregation
of SAA begins with the formation of small oligomers, or the primary
nucleus.2 In solution, human SAA1, murine
SAA1.1, and SAA2.2 adopt diverse oligomeric states, such as monomeric,
dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric (preferentially adopted by murine SAA1.1),
and hexameric (preferentially adopted by murine SAA2.2 and human SAA1).8,9 Among the small oligomers, particularly, dimer levels correlate
positively with the later formation of partially misfolded oligomers.
Thus, in mice, increased levels of amyloidogenic SAA1.1 dimers in
serum are closely linked to the development of AA amyloidosis.10 Furthermore, dimers or dimeric intermediates
were proven to play a role in aggregation and fiber formation of other
amyloidogenic proteins, such as amyloid β,11 transthyretin,12 and insulin.13 Taken together, the dimeric forms of SAA are
likely to serve as a nucleus, leading to SAA fibril formation. However,
available information about the SAA dimeric interface, especially
the structural information, is still rather limited.

Based on
the structural similarity between the human and murine
SAA monomers and the available crystal structure of human SAA1, we
built structural models of murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimers. Furthermore,
we analyzed three phases of SAA oligomer formation: (i) possible formation
of loosely associated SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimeric intermediates, (ii)
transformation of SAA dimeric intermediates to stable dimers in solution,
and (iii) reassembling of dimers into larger oligomers. In addition,
Markov state modeling (MSM) was employed to analyze the potential
effect of the interface on dynamic behavior of key residues and linker
regions.

Methods
System Construction
The murine SAA1.1
and the SAA2.2
models were built by homology modeling. Coordinates of human SAA1
(PDB ID: 4IP8) were used for model construction. By expanding its asymmetric unit,
a dimeric structure with the minimum interaction area was found and
used as a template for murine SAA dimer construction. The interaction
area was calculated in PyMol (Schrödinger 2015) by  where SASA is the solvent-accessible
surface
area.

The sequences of murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 were retrieved
from the UniProt database with the UniProt IDs P05367 and P05366,
respectively. The signaling peptide was removed, and the residues
from G20-Y122 were used for homology modeling. The residue indexes
of both sequences were renumbered to G1-Y103 for the following simulation.
The sequence of murine SAA variants was aligned to the template by
ClustalW214,15 and visualized by ESPript (http://espript.ibcp.fr),16 and the model was constructed by Modeller v9.12.17 Fifty models were generated, and each model
was evaluated by the discrete optimized protein energy score, as well
as the Ramachandra plot in Procheck.18 The
top-scored structures were used for molecular docking and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations.

Model of the SAA–Hyaluronic Acid Complex
Constructed
by Molecular Docking
SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 were processed with
Protein Preparation Wizard in Schrödinger 2014 and parameterized
with all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulation force field.19 A position-restrained energy minimization was
performed by default setting. The three-dimensional (3D) structure
of a hyaluronic acid fragment was built by the LEaP module in AmberTools
(AMBER 2016, University of California, San Francisco) according to
the two-dimensional (2D) structure from the PubChem database. Different
conformations of hyaluronic acid were generated by the LigPrep module
in Schrödinger 2014 suit, and the hyaluronic acid molecule
was docked to the cleft between two SAA monomers by Induced Fit application
in Schrödinger 2014 (Induced Fit Docking protocol, Glide and
Prime software packages).20 The top-scored
structures were used for the following MD simulation.

System Preparation
and Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Protein and hyaluronic
acid molecules were parameterized with Amber14SB21 and GLYCAM-06 force field,22 respectively. The protein or complex was dissolved within
the TIP3P water box. The total atom number of SAA1.1 alone, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic
acid complex, and the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex was around
37 500, and the initial dimension of the system was around
71.8 Å × 71.8 Å × 90.2 Å.

SAA and SAA–hyaluronic
acid systems were energy-minimized in three stages: first, all heavy
atoms of the protein or the protein–hyaluronic acid complex
were position-restrained for 500 steps, then the backbone atoms of
the protein and heavy atoms of hyaluronic acid were position-restrained
for 500 steps, and finally, the restraints were removed and the system
was energy-minimized for another 500 steps. The energy-minimized system
was gradually heated to 310 K in 100 ps with all heavy atoms of the
protein or the protein–hyaluronic acid complex restrained.
Finally, the restraints were gradually removed in a constant-pressure
environment NPT for a total of 2.5 ns. The production NPT run was
performed at 310 K and 1 atm for at least 1.2 μs for every system.

The simulation time step was set to 2 fs, and the van der Waals
interactions were calculated at every step. The long-range electrostatic
interactions were calculated every five steps by the particle mesh
Ewald method23 with a grid size of about
1 Å and a tolerance of 10–6. The cutoff for
the van der Waals interactions was set to 9 Å. The temperature
and pressure were controlled using Langevin dynamics and the Langevin
piston barostat method, respectively. The SHAKE method was used to
restrain hydrogen atoms, and the tolerance was set to 10–8. Atomic coordinates of all atoms were saved every 1 ps. Energy minimization
and MD simulations were performed with NAMD2.24

Trajectory Analysis
Gromacs,25 CARMA,26,27 and Plumed28 were
used for all analyses. Amber topology was converted to Gromacs with
Acpype.29 The root-mean-square deviations
and root-mean-square fluctuations corresponding to the reference structure,
the interaction area, the distance between two monomers, and the hydrogen
bonds (as well as hydrogen-bond distribution) were calculated with
Gromacs. The secondary structure of the protein was calculated by
DSSP30 and visualized with do_dssp in Gromacs.
Dihedrals and angle parameters were calculated by Plumed.

The
free-energy landscape of the conformational change was calculated
following principal component analysis of the whole trajectory. The
first two eigenvectors were chosen to reconstruct the free-energy
landscape,31,32 and for a given conformation
(X), the free-energy was calculated by  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and P(X) is the probability of the above-mentioned
conformation.

The analysis of the interaction between and within
SAA monomers
was conducted by PyEMMA.33 For interaction
analysis between SAA monomers, the minimum distance between Cα
atoms of each residue was calculated. The interaction was counted
as 1 when the distance was shorter than 0.6 nm, otherwise 0. Markov
state models (MSMs) were employed to analyze the trajectories of three
different models according to settings recommended by PyEMMA. As an
input, the nearest-neighbor heavy-atom contacts between the residues
4, 6, 7, 11, 16, 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30, 40, 46, 60, 63, 66, 67, 68,
70, 89, 92, 95, 101, and corresponding surrounding residues were calculated.
The above residues were selected as they either differ between SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 or they are located within the linker region between helices.
The interaction was counted as 1 when the distance was shorter than
0.4 nm, otherwise 0. The dimension of input coordinates was reduced
by time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) on two dimensions.
To converge the maximum likelihood estimation, a time step was set
to 2.0 ns (40 steps) (Figure S1A). Furthermore,
the output of TICA was clustered into microstates using k-means clustering. The microstates were grouped into nine metastable
states by Perron-Cluster Cluster Analysis (PCCA++). The number of
metastable states was selected according to spectral analysis and
the Chapman–Kolmogorov test (Figure S1B). The occupation of metastable states in each model was calculated
by normalizing the frame numbers assigned to each metastable state
with the total frame numbers.

Graphic Visualization
The 3D coordinates of snapshots
were visualized with PyMOL, (Schrödinger 2015) and the electrostatic
surface of SAA was calculated by APBS.34 Line plots and histograms were plotted with Grace (XMGRACE, version
5.1.19), whereas the free-energy landscapes were calculated and visualized
by R package (https://www.R-project.org). Interaction between SAA monomers was visualized by Circos.35

Results and Discussion
Structural Dimeric SAA
Model Adopts a Loosely Associated Conformation
with a Potential Binding Site for Hyaluronic Acid
The resolved
crystal structures of human SAA1 indicated a variety of possible interacting
interfaces, therefore providing a useful tool to study formation of
SAA dimers.3 Hence, 10 different SAA structural
dimer models were constructed (Figure S2) and the area of interaction interfaces was evaluated. The human
SAA1 dimer shown in Figure 1A generated by extending the asymmetric unit exhibits the
lowest interaction area between the monomers (A =
0 Å2). It was chosen to mimic the intermediate states
of the monomer-to-dimer transformation. In addition, the interface
between the SAA monomers is linearly shaped and positively charged
(Figure 1A, center
panel), which enables the binding of a linearly shaped and negatively
charged GAG molecule. Indeed, in vitro studies demonstrated that the
GAGs heparin and heparan sulfate interact with the C-terminus of murine
SAA1.1 and SAA2.2,36 which is in agreement
with the SAA dimer model presented in Figure 1A. The major interaction force between the
SAA monomers in solution is electrostatic force being long-range and,
hence, contributing to a greater extent compared to other forces.37 Considering the differences in the amino acid
sequences involved in the interactions between the SAA1.1 and SAA2.2
variants (Ile6Val, Gly7His, Gly27Asn, Asp30Asn, Gly31Ser, Ala60Gly,
Ser63Ala, Met76Ile, and Ala101Asp), which are largely neutral, we
assumed that SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 share similar loose binding interfaces.

SAA2.2 dimers based on the human SAA1 crystal structure. (A) Three-dimensional

variants. (D) Hyaluronic acid (green sticks) binds to the cleft between
two murine SAA monomers.

Sequence alignment of human SAA1, murine SAA1.1, and murine
SAA2.2
revealed over 70% sequence identity and 87% sequence similarity (Figure 1B). Although the
crystal structures of murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 are not available,
that of human SAA1 provided a good template for homology model construction
of murine SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 (Figure 1C).

We have chosen hyaluronic acid, a linear
high-molecular-weight
glycosaminoglycan composed of disaccharide unit repeats [(1,3)-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1,4)-O-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl]n, to evaluate the GAG effect on the formation of SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 oligomers. To enable molecular modeling, a hyaluronic acid
dimer (tetrasaccharide) [(1,3)-O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1,4)-O-β-d-glucopyranuronosyl]2 was computed. As shown in Figure 1D, hyaluronic acid
falls into the same binding pocket in SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimeric models,
with SAA2.2 exhibiting a slightly higher binding affinity to hyaluronic
acid. The predicted binding free energies of hyaluronic acid to SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 are −13.809 and −15.396 kcal/mol, respectively.
According to the results from molecular docking, the binding structures
are stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the surrounding
Arg89, Asp90, Tyr103, and Arg95, as well as Arg46 located adjacent
to the dimeric interface.

To further validate the model, two
additional GAGs with different
degrees of sulfation, heparin and chondroitin sulfate A, were docked
into the proposed model and two local minima referring to two binding
states, I and II, were identified by free-energy analysis and compared
to that of nonsulfated GAG hyaluronic acid (Figure S3). Previous experimental data demonstrated that all three
GAGs facilitate formation of thioflavin-T-positive SAA1.1 aggregates
in vitro with heparin being the most efficient catalyst of SAA1.1
aggregation and chondroitin sulfate A the least potent one.7 Interestingly, different from heparin and hyaluronic
acid, chondroitin sulfate A promoted formation of spherical particles
and short protofibrils.7 Our model shows
a slightly different binding pose for chondroitin sulfate A in state
I and decreased binding affinity to the partially unfolded N-terminus
in state II compared to heparin and hyaluronic acid (Figure S3), which might provide a feasible explanation for
different effects the GAGs exert on SAA1.1 fibril morphology.

Dimeric
Interface Formation and Alterations in Secondary Structures
of SAA Dimers
SAA1.1, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid complex,
and the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex, all form dimeric structures
during the simulation (Figure 2). The models might explain recent in vitro data that have
demonstrated the existence of lipid-free SAA1.1 dimer in solution.38 However, the interaction interfaces in all structures
differed. Thus, in SAA1.1 in the hyaluronic acid-free form, a symmetrical
binding interface was detected around H3 and H4 helices (Figure 2A, left-hand panel).
By contrast, in the SAA1.1 hyaluronic acid-bound form, an asymmetric
interface was detected around H1 of one monomer and H4 of another
monomer (Figure 2A,
center panel, and Figure S4). The interface
of two monomers in the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex is located
around the C-terminus of one monomer and the N-terminus of another
monomer (Figure 2A,
right-hand panel). At variance to SAA1.1, the interaction between
two monomers in SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid is partially mediated
by hyaluronic acid.

Figure 2 Interaction between SAA1.1 monomers forming a dimer leads
to partial
unfolding and kink formation in the N-terminus and in parts of the
H3 and H4 helices. (A) Scheme of interactions between two monomers
for SAA1.1 in the hyaluronic acid-free form (left-hand panel), SAA1.1
in the hyaluronic acid-bound form (center panel), and SAA2.2 in the
hyaluronic acid-bound form (right-hand panel). (B) Secondary structural
changes for SAA1.1 in the hyaluronic acid-free form (left-hand panels),
SAA1.1 in the hyaluronic acid-bound form (center panels), and SAA2.2
in the hyaluronic acid-bound form (right-hand panels). Labeling: monomer
I, blue; monomer II, black. Representative conformational changes
of the SAA1.1 N-terminus of the hyaluronic acid-free (C) and the hyaluronic
acid-bound forms (D).

SAA aggregation and fibril formation are accompanied by secondary
structure alterations. In response to low pH, acidic lysophospholipid
environment, GAG binding, or high temperature, the α-helical
structure of SAA1.1 is converted to random coil or β-strand
structures,2,39 resulting in decreased solubility
as well as decreased stability. Importantly, the amyloidogenicities
of different SAA regions are different: the highly amyloidogenic segments
are more sensitive to environmental changes and exhibit an increased
rate of losing their helical structures. The identified amyloidogenic
regions of human SAA1 include the N-terminal (residues 1–27)
and central regions (residues 43–63).40 Two residues, residue 52 and residue 57 in human SAA1 (V51 and V56
in murine SAA1.1), are key determinants of the segment amyloidogenicity.41

MD simulations show that interaction between
SAA1.1 monomers results
in a secondary structure switch from α-helix to turn or coil
in the N-terminus (residues 1–10) and parts of the H3 (residues
59–66) and H4 (residues 71–80) helices as shown in Figure 2B. Similar behavior
is also seen in the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex. However,
the presence of a partially unfolded conformation in SAA2.2 is less
frequent than in SAA1.1.

According to the simulation, the first
10 residues of the N-termini
of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 are least stable (Figure 2B). This finding is in accordance with a
previous in silico study42 and with a recent
publication supporting in vivo amyloidogenicity of the N-terminal
residues of murine SAA1.1 and of human SAA1 lacking the N-terminal
Arg.43 Interestingly, also monomeric SAA1.1
shows secondary structural transformation in the above-mentioned regions.
Thus, the N-terminus of the H1 helix of a monomer is unfolded during
the simulation, indicating the intrinsic instability of the N-terminus
similar to that observed in the dimeric model. Occasionally, unfolded
H3 and H4 helices are refolded to helical structures at the end of
the simulation (Figure S5), which indicates
that the destabilization of the amyloidogenic region might be partially
dependent on dimerization.

Hyaluronic Acid Facilitates SAA1.1 Dimer
Assembly by Reducing
Nonspecific Interactions
Dynamical cross-correlation matrix
(DCCM) is a commonly used tool for MD simulation analysis, which provides
insights into the correlated motion of atoms in the whole system.44 In this study, the cross-correlation maps are
visualized with a color map, with the color gradient going from dark
blue (−1, anticorrelated motion), through yellow (0, noncorrelated
motion), to dark red (1, cooperative motion). As shown in Figure 3A, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic
acid complex shows more cooperative motion, especially in the off-diagonal
regions. For example, a cooperative motion is observed between the
H1 helix (residues 1–20) of monomer I and H2 (residues 20–40)
or the H4 (residues 80–90) helix of monomer II. These cooperative
motions are not observed in the hyaluronic acid-free form of the SAA1.1
dimer. On the other hand, hyaluronic acid changes the trend of motion
between the H1 helix of monomer II and the H4 helix of monomer I from
anticorrelated (hyaluronic acid-free form) to cooperative (hyaluronic
acid-bound form), indicating that hyaluronic acid affects the SAA1.1
dimer formation.

Figure 3 Hyaluronic acid binding stabilizes the SAA1.1 dimer by
increasing
cooperative motion and by decreasing nonspecific interactions. (A)
Dynamic cross-correlation matrices (DCCMs) of hyaluronic acid-free
and hyaluronic acid-bound forms of the SAA1.1 dimer reveal the increased
off-diagonal cooperative motion of atoms in the hyaluronic acid-bound
form (red squares). (B) Free-energy surface (FES) of SAA1.1 dimer
in the hyaluronic acid-free and -bound forms; t =
0, starting point. The protein structures of SAA1.1 dimers exhibiting
the lowest free energy as indicated in (B) are shown for the hyaluronic
acid-free form (C) and for the hyaluronic acid-bound form (D). Hyaluronic
acid is visualized as green sticks. State I, early time point; state
II, later time point.

After examination of the MD trajectories of hyaluronic acid-free
and -bound SAA1.1 dimers, we found that one monomer searches for a
preferred binding site mainly through rotating around another monomer.
To measure the rotation direction, two dihedrals were defined (Figure 3B). The dihedral
I is used to measure the rotation along the axis of the H2 helix of
the monomer II (denoted “b” in the left-hand panel of Figure 3B), and the dihedral
II is used to measure the rotation perpendicular to the above-mentioned
axis (denoted “a” in the left-hand panel of Figure 3B). The 2D density
plot demonstrates the possible range of dihedrals and their corresponding
free energy.

The free-energy surface (FES) of the hyaluronic
acid-free form
of SAA1.1 dimer shows one local minimum and a broad basin over a large
space, whereas the SAA1.1 dimer complex with hyaluronic acid exhibits
two local minima connected by a narrow deep basin (Figure 3B). The distance between the
starting point (t = 0) and the local minima in the
hyaluronic acid-bound form is much shorter than in the hyaluronic
acid-free form. The closely positioned local minima
and the short distance between the starting point and the local minima,
as well as a narrow deep basin connecting the two local FES minima,
indicate for hyaluronic acid an easier swap between the two potential
ligand binding sites. Moreover, the movement of hyaluronic acid to
another binding site might be used by the SAA1.1 dimer to attract
a new SAA1.1 monomer by utilizing hyaluronic acid as a “bait”.
On the other hand, the broad and shallow free-energy basins and high
number of minima indicate that the hyaluronic acid-free SAA1.1 dimer
is stabilized largely by nonspecific interactions, an observation
supported also by others.45,46 On the contrary, a
free-energy landscape with a narrow and deep basin indicates that
hyaluronic acid facilitates the SAA1.1 dimer formation by decreasing
nonspecific interactions of flexible regions located on the surface
of the protein. Protein structures of SAA1.1 dimers exhibiting the
lowest free energy, i.e., state I of the hyaluronic-free form and
states I and II of the hyaluronic-bound form, are presented in Figure 3C,D, respectively.

SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 Possess Different Binding Interfaces for Hyaluronic
Acid
To assess the binding site transition for hyaluronic
acid in SAA1.1 and SAA2.2, the angle between either SAA dimer and
hyaluronic acid and the distance between the monomer C-termini were
plotted along with the simulation (Figure 4A). The relatively small angle (Figure 4A, left-hand panel)
and a more symmetric hydrogen-bond distribution in the SAA2.2 dimer
(Figure 4C) indicate
that hyaluronic acid does not leave the cleft near the C-terminus
of SAA2.2 dimer. The different paradigms in SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 dimerization
in the presence of hyaluronic acid were further confirmed by additional
simulations using different binding poses and starting velocities.
As shown in Figure S6, a symmetrical distribution
of hydrogen bonds in hyaluronic acid–SAA2.2 dimer and a generally
asymmetrical distribution of hydrogen bonds in hyaluronic acid–SAA1.1
dimer were observed.

Figure 4 SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 use different interfaces to bind and
stabilize
the hyaluronic acid molecule. (A) Angle between either SAA1.1 or SAA2.2
dimer and hyaluronic acid and the distance between the center of mass
(COM) of the SAA C-termini are plotted along with the simulation.
Angles were built using COM of SAA monomer I and hyaluronic acid as
rays and COM of the monomer II as a vertex. The number of hydrogen
bonds between SAA1.1 and hyaluronic acid (B) and between SAA2.2 and
hyaluronic acid (C) along with the simulation. The N-terminus movement
(arrows) and hydrogen bonds of SAA1.1 (D) and SAA2.2 (E) in the presence
of hyaluronic acid during the first 50 ns of simulations.

On the other hand, the hydrogen bonds between hyaluronic
acid and
the SAA1.1 monomer II vanish after 750 ns (Figure 4B, right-hand panel). Unexpectedly, hydrogen
bonds suddenly appear at about 1000 ns, indicating a remarkable binding
site switch by hyaluronic acid on the SAA1.1 dimer. The trajectory
shows that hyaluronic acid falls into the cleft between the H1 of
monomer I and the H2, H3, and H4 of monomer II. Because of repulsion
between the negatively charged cleft and hyaluronic acid, it moves
quickly out of the binding site as reflected by the disappearance
of the hydrogen bonds between hyaluronic acid and monomer II between
750 and 1000 ns (Figure 4B, right-hand panel). Differently, the repulsion in SAA2.2 is not
sufficient to initiate the hyaluronic acid transition.

A comparison
of snapshots from 0 to 50 ns during the simulation
(Figure 4D,E) shows
that the stability of the H1 helix as well as the difference in the
residue 101 (Ala101Asp, SAA1.1 vs SAA2.2) between SAA1.1 and SAA2.2
might be the key to their binding site difference toward hyaluronic
acid. Indeed, substitution of aspartic acid with alanine at position
101 of SAA2.2 increased the distance between the N-terminal helix
and A101 in the C-terminus compared to wild-type protein in the SAA2.2
dimer model, supporting the hypothesis and the role of D101 in SAA2.2
dimer formation (Figure S7). Accordingly,
computational studies demonstrate that the residues in the center
of the helix play a role in either stabilizing or destabilizing the
helical structure. Thus, His, Ala, and Glu contribute to the stabilization
of a helix,47 whereas Pro, Gly, and Trp
contribute to the unfolding or kink formation in an α-helix.48 In our simulation, the residue difference in
position 7 (Gly in SAA1.1 and His in SAA2.2) results in a hydrogen-bond
switch (Figure 4D,E,
right-hand panels). Thus, the hydrogen bonds between the backbone
atoms of Phe2, Phe3, Val6, and His7 in SAA2.2 are disrupted in SAA1.1.
As a result, in SAA1.1, a kink in the helix is formed around Ile6
and Gly7. Hence, the partial unfolding and kink formation of the N-terminus
adjacent to the H1 helix slightly increases the distance between the
N- and C-termini in the SAA1.1 dimer, and hyaluronic acid leaves the
original binding site through rotation of the SAA1.1 monomer and decreased
steric effects. On the contrary, the electrostatic attraction between
Asp101 and the positively charged sequence adjacent to the N-terminus
reduces the distance between the N- and C-termini of two SAA2.2 monomers
(Figure 4E), suggesting
that the N-terminal helix and Asp101 in the C-terminus of SAA2.2 might
“lock” hyaluronic acid in a cleft inside the dimer.

SAA1.1 Exhibits Three Different Binding Sites for Hyaluronic
Acid
Because of the negatively charged properties of hyaluronic
acid, its binding to amyloidogenic proteins is mediated largely by
electrostatic attraction to polar residues. Accordingly, we plotted
the hydrogen-bond number, as well as the distribution of hydrogen
bonds to different residues. The hydrogen-bond-distribution pattern
(Figure 5A) indicates
three different binding sites for hyaluronic acid on the SAA1.1 dimer
besides the one identified on the initial conformation. With the rotation
of the SAA1.1 monomer I around monomer II, hyaluronic acid leaves
the original binding site and binds to a shallow pocket located within
the C-terminus of the SAA1.1 monomer II and a loop region connecting
H3 and H4 helices in the SAA1.1 monomer I (180 ns snapshot in Figure 5B). Then, hyaluronic
acid binds to a pocket formed by the H1, H3, and H4 helices in the
SAA1.1 monomer I along with the rotation of monomer I (447 and 910
ns snapshots in Figure 5B). Interestingly, hyaluronic acid is finally stabilized by the partially
unfolded N-terminus of SAA1.1 (1470 ns snapshot in Figure 5B). Besides, hydrogen bonds
are mainly distributed around polar residues located on the surface
of SAA1.1, suggesting that electrostatic forces and not hydrophobic
interactions might play the major role in hyaluronic acid binding.

Figure 5 SAA1.1
dimer exhibits three different binding sites for hyaluronic
acid. (A) Total number of hydrogen bonds in the hyaluronic acid-bound
SAA1.1 dimer (upper panel), and the hydrogen-bond-existence map (lower
panel) showing three different patterns. (B) Residues stabilizing
the interaction between hyaluronic acid and SAA1.1 demonstrate partial
unfolding of the N-terminus stabilizing the structure.

Additional 800 ns simulations performed on SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 in
the presence of hyaluronic acid confirmed the convergence and reproducibility
of our molecular dynamics simulations (Figure S8).

Model of SAA1.1 in the Hyaluronic Acid-Bound
Form Exhibits Specific
Metastable State Distribution
As mentioned above, murine
SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 differ only by the nine residues, Ile6Val, Gly7His,
Gly27Asn, Asp30Asn, Gly31Ser, Ala60Gly, Ser63Ala, Met76Ile, and Ala101Asp.
However, the two SAA isomers exhibit remarkably different fibril formation
kinetics and pathogenic properties with only SAA1.1, but not SAA2.2,
found in murine amyloid deposits.1 To find
long-time statistical conformational dynamics of above residues in
three models, SAA1.1, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid complex, and
the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex, Markov state models (MSMs)
were constructed. The MSM analysis shows that the dynamic behavior
of the key residues could be partially related to the formation of
different interfaces.

Thus, MSM analysis has identified nine
metastable states in the above three models (Table S1 and Figure 6A). The representative snapshots of each metastable state are shown
in Figure 6B. According
to the probability distribution (Table S1), a highly populated metastable state IX is detected in all three
models. The conformation of the state IX shows no contact between
linker I and linker III in all three models, which represent the conformation
of the starting point (Figure 1B). However, the distribution of the other less populated
metastable states varies in each model. In the SAA1.1–hyaluronic
acid model, a broader distribution among all nine metastable states
is observed with frequencies ranging between 3.5 and 29.1%, except
for the state VI. However, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid-free
model and the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid models have only two or
three highly populated models that capture around 95% of the population.
In addition, MSM analysis has identified three states, I, II, and
V, which are unique to the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid model (Tables S1 and S2).

Figure 6 Markov state modeling
(MSM) for SAA1.1, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic
acid complex, and the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex identifies
nine metastable states characterized by contact between linker I,
linker III, helix I, and helix III. (A) Time-lagged independent component
analysis (TICA) plot with microstates is shown in the left-hand panel.
Microstates from k-means clustering are plotted with
dots. The microstates are clustered into nine metastable states (I,
light sea-green; II, olive; III, deep sky-blue; IV, aqua; V, lime;
VI, medium sea-green; VII, dodger-blue; VIII, light sky-blue, and
IX, blue). An illustration of linker I, linker III, helix I, and helix
III is shown in the right-hand panel. (B) Representative structures
of each metastable state. N-terminus, pink; linker I, marine; linker
III, orange. (C) Interface and hyaluronic acid (green sticks) binding
site for groups 3 and 4 of SAA1.1.

Metastable states identified by MSM can be further combined
into
four groups according to their conformation (Table 1). Group I is highly populated in all three
models, which contain states III, VIII, and IX. Group 1 is characterized
by few or even absent contacts between linker I and linker III. Group
2 contains states II, IV, V, and VI, which are characterized by a
kink on the H3 helix as well as the contact between linker I and linker
III. Both SAA1.1 models are highly populated in this group. Hence,
residues 60 and 63 that are different in SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 (Ala60Gly,
Ser63Ala) might contribute to the additional flexibility of the H3
helix in the SAA1.1 models. The role of the interface in group 2 cannot
be derived from this analysis.

helix	I	0	3.4	0	
In group
3, the modeling indicates a possible contact between the
H1 and the H3 helix. In addition, SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid-free
and SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid-bound models are highly populated
in this group. Considering the fact that the interface is located
around H1 and H3, the increased contact may result from a repulse
between two monomers (Figure 6C). A decreased volume and decreased water exposure of residues
on the H1 helix in group 3 might facilitate stabilization of the secondary
structure of the protein.

Group 4 contains only one state, state
I, and is unique to the
SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid-bound model. As shown in Figure 6C, state I exhibits a characteristic
partially unfolded H3 helix inserted into the cleft inside a SAA1.1
monomer. Further computational analysis shows that hyaluronic acid
also participates in the formation of the partially unfolded H3 helix.
Hence, we hypothesized that the increased freedom caused by the binding
interface switch may contribute to the formation of this state. Besides,
the increased unfolded structure and water exposure of hydrophobic
residues are considered to be energetically unfavorable and less stable.

Possible Oligomeric States of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 as Determined
by Free-Energy Analysis of the Dimers
Both SAA1.1 and SAA2.2
complexes with hyaluronic acid exhibit two local minima according
to the free-energy landscape (Figure 7A,B). States I of either complex, which appear at about
50–100 ns of the simulation, share a similar conformation:
the binding site of hyaluronic acid is still located between SAA monomers,
and the C-termini are far from each other. This model is in agreement
with our hypothesis that SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 share similar initial binding
modes of the hyaluronic acid molecule (Figure 7A,B, state I).

Figure 7 (A) SAA1.1 and (B) SAA2.2
oligomer formation. Conformations of
SAA with the lowest free energy govern the proposed oligomeric states
of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2. Upper panels: the free-energy landscape of SAA
and the position of hyaluronic acid (green sticks) in SAA dimers (state
I, early time point; state II, later time point). Lower panels: kinetics
of the dihedral angel changes between the C-termini.

However, states II of SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 are different.
As shown
previously, SAA rotates a certain angle during the transformation
from a loosely to a tightly bound structure. Accordingly, the dihedral
of the C-termini of two SAA monomers (the most stable SAA regions)
in the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid complex stabilizes at around
85° (Figure 7A),
whereas the dihedral of the SAA2.2–hyaluronic acid complex
stabilizes at around 60° (Figure 7B). If we consider the oligomer formation as a continuous
progress, a new SAA1.1 monomer binds to the cleft and also turns at
about 85° to achieve the stabilized conformation, resulting in
tetramer formation as a block for a larger oligomer structure (Figure 7A). Similarly, the
SAA2.2 monomer will rotate 60° and form a hexamer with a central
channel, as a building block for a larger oligomer structure (Figure 7B). This computational
model offers a plausible explanation of literature data demonstrating
that in solution SAA2.2 forms a hexamer with a central channel.8,9 The potential role of hyaluronic acid in oligomerization of SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 leading to formation of SAA1.1 tetramer and SAA2.2 hexamer
building blocks is described in the Supporting Information and is
illustrated in Figure S9.

SAA C-Terminus
is a Stable Structural Motif with Diverse Functions
The C-terminus
of human SAA1 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and
a salt bridge between Arg96, Lys103, Asn93, and Tyr104. In addition,
the proline residues 93, 97, and 101 contribute to the stabilization
of the C-terminus by stereoelectronic and steric effects.3 An NMR study showed that the C-terminal fragment
is able to preserve its conformation in solution.49 Although the transition of the SAA dimeric interface happens
rapidly during the first 100 ns of the simulation, the configuration
of the C-terminal loop is preserved along with the simulation, which
might be due to the relatively low B-factor of this region in the
crystal structure and in accordance with in vitro findings.3,49

Functions of the SAA C-terminus include GAGs binding as well
as modulation of the SAA fibril formation.2,50 Still,
the mechanism of the C-terminus-mediated fibril formation is ambiguous.
In humans, a C-terminal-truncated SAA1 shows an increased aggregation
and fibril formation rate in the presence of GAGs compared to full-length
SAA1, indicating that the C-terminus may function as a stabilizer
of SAA.1 Differently, in vitro studies
demonstrated that a C-terminal-truncated murine SAA2.2 exhibited a
slower fibril formation rate and different oligomeric states compared
to full-length SAA2.2.50 The results from
our simulation suggest that the SAA C-terminus might not only form
the binding pocket for hyaluronic acid in a loosely bound SAA dimeric
model but might also participate in the formation of a more stable
dimeric structure obtained from the free-energy landscape. This observation
indicates that the function of the C-terminus of SAAs might be closely
related to its dimeric interface. Further studies of the oligomeric
states, particularly the oligomeric interfaces, might help us to better
understand the function of the C-terminus in SAA proteins.

Conclusions
Formation of dimers and small oligomers
is an important initial step of SAA fibril formation and subsequent
aggregation that is affected by hyaluronic acid binding. Here, we
built a loosely bound dimeric intermediate shared by murine SAA1.1
and SAA2.2 and revealed distinct dimeric interfaces formed by amyloidogenic
SAA1.1 and nonamyloidogenic SAA2.2 in three distinct models, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic
acid-free form, the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid-bound form, and
the SAA2.2 hyaluronic acid-bound form. The model suggests that in
SAA1.1 binding of hyaluronic acid might promote oligomer formation
by transient interaction, which decreases nonspecific interactions
between SAA1.1 monomers and promotes the formation of an asymmetric
interface involving the H1/H2 helices and the H4/C-terminus. In SAA2.2,
hyaluronic acid is shown to bind to the cleft between two SAA2.2 monomers
formed by H1 and H2 helices of one monomer and the C-terminus of another
monomer, forming a scaffold for larger oligomer assembly.

Besides,
Markov state modeling indicated that SAA1.1 and SAA2.2 exhibit distinct
dynamic behavior of the linker region adjacent to H1 and H3 helices,
which may be related to the differences in binding interfaces. A unique
state in the SAA1.1–hyaluronic acid model shows a partially
unfolded H3 helix.

The model and the interfaces elaborated by
computational modeling
suggest that the pathogenic SAA isomer, SAA1.1, might employ a different
mechanism for oligomer formation compared to nonpathogenic SAA2.2,
which might offer a plausible explanation why only the SAA1.1 isoform
is found in SAA amyloid deposits. These findings might assist researchers
working with mouse models of AA amyloidosis. Hence, the study might
facilitate the discovery and design of novel SAA aggregation inhibitors
targeting the interfaces in early steps of amyloid formation.
