In cell therapies, it is advantageous
to encapsulate live cells
in protective, semipermeable microparticles for controlled release
of cytokines, growth factors, monoclonal antibodies, or insulin. Here,
a modified electrospraying approach with an organic solution of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymer is used to create synthetic
PLGA capsules that effectively protect live cells. Using a design
of experiment (DOE) methodology, the effect of governing jetting parameters
on encapsulation efficiency, yield, and size is systematically evaluated.
On the basis of this analysis, the interaction between bovine serum
albumin concentration and core flow rate is the most dominant factor
determining core encapsulation efficiency as well as the microcapsule
size. However, the interaction between shell solvent ratio and shell
flow rate predominantly defines the particle yield. To validate these
findings, live cells have been successfully encapsulated in microcapsules
using optimized parameters from the DOE analysis and have survived
the electrohydrodynamic jetting process. Extending the currently available
toolkit for cell microencapsulation, these biodegradable, semi-impermeable
cell-laden microcapsules may find a range of applications in areas
such as tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, cell-based therapies have emerged as promising
strategies intended to augment conventional drug-based therapies.
In particular, cell therapies have been developed for local production
of a range of biologics such as cytokines, growth factors, monoclonal
antibodies, and insulin.1,2 However, the direct
administration of foreign cells using intradermal techniques has been
plagued by immunorejection of the transplanted cells. Alternatively,
encapsulation of live cells in microparticles has been evaluated as
a potential method to mitigate unwanted host responses.3 Microcapsules can provide a protective environment
for cells to proliferate and generate therapeutic agents, while permitting
bidirectional diffusion of oxygen, nutrients, and metabolites.4,5 So far, natural hydrogels have been the material of choice for microencapsulation
of cells because their processing is done under physiologically compatible
conditions.6 In particular, agarose, alginate,
and collagen are widely used natural hydrogels for cellular encapsulation.7 Although the permeable nature of these hydrogels
permits cell proliferation and rapid diffusion, the particle design
space is potentially restricted by factors such as temperature, pH,
or incorporation of cross-linking agents needed to crosslink the natural
hydrogels.8,9 In principle, synthetic polymers provide
a wider experimental spectrum that allows for systematic changes in
the particle size, porosity, and membrane thickness. However, a major
challenge has been to avoid exposure of cells to organic solvents
and nonphysiological temperatures needed for the processing of synthetic
polymers. A potential solution offers the use of a core–shell
structure, wherein the cells are encapsulated in the core and are
fully separated from the polymer shell throughout the fabrication
process.

The structure of core–shell particles creates
a biologically
safe environment for the cell in the core, while utilizing polyesters
such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) in the
shell creates a protective layer that allows for the study of individual
cells and provides the means to deliver the cells into various environments
such as low/high pH conditions and high enzyme tissues. It also allows
individual cell entrapment, which has important applications in single
cell-based biology, development of biosensor circuits, and bioreactors.
It also protects the cells against lethal stressors resembling the
sporulation process in nature.10,11 Moreover, because the
viability of the cells inside the particles depends on the permeability
of the particles, individual cell encapsulation eliminates the problem
of cells farther from the barrier receiving less nutrients.7

Encapsulation of cells in microparticles
has been achieved using
several different techniques, such as electrostatic spraying, emulsion,
micro-nozzle array, interfacial polymerization, and extrusion methods.12−16 Using a modified electrospraying approach, we now report a new type
of polymer capsule that is composed of PLGA shells protecting live
cells inside the core.

2 Results and Discussion
To prepare polymer capsules containing live cells, the PLGA solution
and a cell-loaded core solution are simultaneously driven through
a needle using a sufficiently high electrical voltage. This work has
been inspired by past studies that report significant control over
critical properties of multicompartmental nano- and microparticles.17−20 As previously reported, the viscoelastic polymeric solution at the
tip of the needle forms into a droplet and becomes stable under an
applied electric potential. This stability is the result of the equilibrium
between the applied electric force and the surface tension in the
viscoelastic droplet.21 Rapid evaporation
of solvents from both the shell and the core results in the fabrication
of core–shell microparticles. Typically, particles fabricated
using this technique feature small size distribution with high surface
to volume ratios that enhance the transfer of oxygen and nutrients.22 The schematic of this process is depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of coaxial electrohydrodynamic (EHD) jetting.
The viscoelastic polymer shell and the cell-loaded core solutions
are forced through a coaxial needle under applied electric potential
resulting in cell encapsulated core–shell microparticles.

Control over encapsulation efficiency,
yield, and size of the particles
are of significant importance for cell-based therapies. Importantly,
this study utilizes a design of experiment (DOE) methodology to identify
optimum parameters for microencapsulation of living cells in biodegradable
polymer capsules. DOE methodology not only predicts the main factors
affecting the encapsulation efficiency, yield, and size of the particles,
but also determines the important interaction factors. Factorial DOE
was utilized in this study to investigate the contribution of each
input parameter on the process outputs. An improved insight into the
relevance of the applicable parameters along with their interactions
on the output parameters such as efficiency, size, and yield can enhance
our understanding of the particle fabrication process.

The DOE
methodology offers an efficient approach in the determination
of significant contributing factors while reducing bias and the total
number of trials. In electrospraying, there are many controllable
parameters that have an impact in particle fabrication, which include
surface tension, dielectric constant, density, viscosity of the solution,
and the vapor pressure of solvent.23,24 These parameters
are all dependent on the composition of the jetting solution. Secondary
factors such as applied voltage, needle tip to collector distance,
and environmental factors like ambient temperature and humidity also
affect the experimental outcome. However, in a typical experiment,
these secondary factors remain approximately constant. We note that
the applied voltage required to deform the coaxial meniscus into the
corresponding Taylor cone may vary slightly between experiments.25 A set of 16 experimental trials was conducted
through the study of the experimental space as described in the design
matrix (Table 1). The
order of the experiments was randomized to reduce bias.26Table 1 lists the five experimental factors that were chosen at two
levels for this study. By definition, levels are defined as the specific
quantities assumed for each of the factors. These five experimental
factors were bovine serum albumin (BSA) concentration (A), core flow
rate (B), PLGA concentration (C), shell solvent ratio (D), and shell
flow rate (E). It was assumed based on prior experience that these
factors have the most effect on the morphology and yield of core–shell
particles. The specific quantities selected for each parameter were
based on initial studies and the stability of the Taylor cone during
the EHD jetting process. Preliminary data (not shown) suggested that
the stability of the Taylor cone is predominantly dependent on the
polymer solutions used for jetting. These confining parameters include
the volatility, concentration, and the dielectric constant of the
solutions used for the electrospraying process. The more concentrated
the polymer solution is, the more gradual the precipitation process
becomes, which results in fabrication of particles with higher sphericity.27 Here, PLGA solutions with a mixture of chloroform
and dimethylformamide (DMF) with polymer concentrations of 10% (w/v)
and 15% (w/v) were chosen because higher PLGA concentrations resulted
in fiber formation. Chloroform has a higher volatility than DMF and
constitutes the majority of the solvent. On the other hand, DMF has
a higher dielectric constant and tends to increase the stability of
the Taylor cone during particle fabrication. Consequently, chloroform/DMF
ratios of 97:3 and 90:10 (v/v) were chosen as the two levels for this
study. The addition of BSA to the core solution was thought to improve
the overall biocompatibility of polymer microcapsules and to increase
cell viability. BSA also increased the viscosity of the core solution
and thus stabilized the EHD jet. The two levels for the BSA concentration
were 10% (w/v) and 20% (w/v). Flow rates of 0.1 and 0.5 mL h–1 were selected for the shell solution, and 0.02 and 0.1 mL h–1 were chosen for the core solution, by taking into
account the diameter differences in the jetting needles and to reduce
the polydispersity of the particles that are often observed with higher
flow rates.28,29

Once the design space for each parameter
was determined, particles
were prepared under conditions defined by the overall matrix of all
available options. After completion of the 16 experimental runs, the
data was analyzed to identify the effects of each contributing factor
in the fabrication of core–shell particles. The DOE analysis
was carried out for three different experimental responses: (i) core
encapsulation efficiency, (ii) yield, and (iii) size.

2.1 Core Encapsulation Efficiency
Core
encapsulation efficiency is the fraction of particles that feature
a core/shell architecture, that is, the fraction of particles that
are intact microcapsules. Because both the core (red) and the shell
(blue) compartments were fluorescent, the microcapsules could be analyzed
using flow cytometry. Excitation intensity of DAPI (blue fluorescence)
from a dye added to the polymer shell and Texas red (red fluorescence)
from a dye added to the core revealed the percentage of particles
in each experiment that were fully intact microcapsules. After the
collection of data for each of the 16 experimental runs, DOE analysis
was performed. Apart from studying the impact of the five main effects,
DOE can also assist in the identification of statistically significant
two-factor interactions. Subsequently, the interaction effects that
were least significant (highest p-value) in core
encapsulation efficiency were systematically eliminated from the model
until each interaction had a p-value below 0.05 (95%
confidence level) (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Determination of significant contributing factors in encapsulation
efficiency. (a) Interaction plot for core encapsulation efficiency.
(b) Contour plot of core encapsulation efficiency vs. core flow rate
and BSA concentration, where PLGA concentration, shell solvent ratio,
and shell flow rate are all held constant at 12.5% w/v, 93.5:6.5 v/v
CHCl3/DMF, and 0.3 mL h–1, respectively.
(c) Pareto chart of significant contributing factors in core encapsulation
efficiency. Experimental factors are as follows: (A) BSA concentration,
(B) core flow rate, (C) PLGA concentration, (D) shell solvent ratio,
and (E) shell flow rate.

As shown in Figure 2, four two-factor interactions and two main factors are significantly
influencing the core encapsulation efficiency at a 95% confidence
level. The Pareto chart of effects (Figure 2C) reveals the significance of each effect
against a reference line. Any main or two-factor interaction effect
that surpasses the reference line is considered statistically significant
(p-value <0.05).

For core encapsulation
efficiency, the two main factors are the
PLGA concentration and the shell solvent ratio. Relevant two-factor
interactions include AB (BSA concentration and core flow rate), BC
(core flow rate and PLGA concentration), BE (core flow rate and shell
flow rate) and DE (shell solvent ratio and shell flow rate). Interestingly,
the most dominant two-factor interaction is AB, both of which are
independent of the shell flow. This dominance is apparent through
the interaction plot, wherein AB has the largest slope difference
(Figure 2C). In an
interaction plot, the greater the difference in slopes between the
two lines, the greater the degree of interaction between those factors.
Hence, parallel lines in the interaction plot indicate the absence
of interactions. Knowledge of the main and two-factor interactions
that contribute to the encapsulation efficiency along with their absolute
value was utilized to generate a model (Figure S1). This predictive model, which is not shown here, was then
used to generate a contour plot. In Figure 2B, the relationship between core encapsulation
efficiency, core flow rate, and BSA concentration is summarized in
the contour plot: Core flow rate and BSA concentration have to be
selected concurrently to have a positive effect on the efficiency.
The range of these parameters in the lower left corner is roughly
0.02–0.035 mL h–1 for the core flow rate
and 10–12% (w/v) for the BSA concentration. In the upper right
hand corner, this range is between 0.09 and 0.1 mL h–1 for the core flow rate and between 19 and 20% (w/v) for the BSA
concentration.

2.2 Microcapsule Yield
Here, the microcapsule
yield is defined as the number of particles prepared per mass of PLGA
used. The number of particles was measured using a hemocytometer. Figure 3 displays the analyses
that followed the experimental approach described in the previous
section.

Figure 3 Determination of significant contributing factors in microcapsule
yield. (a) Interaction plot for the yield of microparticles. (b) Contour
plot of yield vs shell flow rate and shell solvent ratio, where BSA
concentration, core flow rate, and PLGA concentration are all held
constant at 15% w/v, 0.06 mL h–1, and 12.5% w/v,
respectively. (c) Pareto chart of significant contributing factors
in determination of yield. Experimental factors are as follows: (A)
BSA concentration, (B) core flow rate, (C) PLGA concentration, (D)
shell solvent ratio, and (E) shell flow rate.

Similar to core encapsulation efficiency, systematic elimination
of insignificant parameters from the model yielded a Pareto chart
that identified the main factors and two-factor interactions.

As shown in Figure 3C, the main contributing factor is core flow rate. Moreover, there
are two significant two-factor interactions: DE (shell solvent ratio
and shell flow rate) and AC (BSA concentration and PLGA concentration).
As described in the case of core encapsulation efficiency, the slope
differences in the interaction plot are indicative of the significance
of each interaction (Figure 3A). Because DE (shell solvent ratio, shell flow rate) has
the largest slope differences and utmost significance, a contour plot
displaying the relationship between yield, shell flow rate, and shell
solvent ratio has been prepared (Figure 3B). Similar to core encapsulation efficiency
analysis, the contour plot was generated using a predictive model,
which is not shown here (Figure S2). According
to Figure 3B, to maximize
yield, a shell flow rate in the range of 0.4–0.5 mL h–1 is recommended; however, the shell/solvent ratio should be in the
range of 96:4–97:3 (v/v) chloroform and DMF. Note that even
though AD (BSA concentration and shell solvent ratio) did not have
a significant effect on the yield of core–shell particles,
it was not eliminated in the analysis process because the predictive
model used in development of the contour plot had a significantly
higher coefficient of determination (R2), when including this two-factor interaction in the analysis.

2.3 Microcapsule Size
In addition to
core encapsulation efficiency and yield, particle size is a critical
property for any biomedical application involving cell-laden microcapsules.30 A corresponding DOE analysis was thus also carried
out to determine the significant main and interaction factors affecting
the size of core–shell particles. The data for this analysis
are presented in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Determination of significant contributing factors in microcapsule
size. (a) Interaction plot for the size of microparticles. (b) Contour
plot of size vs core flow rate and BSA concentration, where PLGA concentration,
shell solvent ratio, and shell flow rate are all held constant at
12.5% w/v, 93.5:6.5 CHCl3/DMF, and 0.3 mL h–1, respectively. (c) Pareto chart of significant contributing factors
in the determination of size. Experimental factors are as follows:
(A) BSA concentration, (B) core flow rate, (C) PLGA concentration,
(D) shell solvent ratio, and (E) shell flow rate.

According to the size distribution Pareto chart (Figure 4C), there are three
main factors
and two two-factor interactions that significantly influence the size
of microcapsules. The three main factors are the shell solvent ratio,
the core flow rate, and the shell flow rate. The two-factor interactions
are AB (BSA concentration, core flow rate) and BC (core flow rate,
PLGA concentration). Because the interaction between BSA concentration
and core flow rate is the most dominant, a contour plot displaying
the relationship between size, core flow rate, and BSA concentration
was generated (Figure 4B). Similar to core encapsulation efficiency and yield analysis,
the contour plot was generated using a predictive model, which is
not shown here (Figure S3). According to
the contour plot, the size of the microcapsules is independent of
the core flow rate for BSA concentrations between 10 and 12.5% (w/v).
These BSA concentrations also yielded the most monodisperse particles.
However, as the concentration of BSA increases, the variance of the
particle size increases concurrently. Because the goal of the experiment
is to encapsulate primary mammalian cells with an estimated diameter
of 8–10 μm; 8–10 μm was defined as the target
value for the microcapsules. On the basis of this analysis, we came
to know that there are two distinct regions that result in the highest
encapsulation efficiency. Those regions were with core flow rates
between 0.02 and 0.035 mL h–1 in conjunction with
10–12% (w/v) BSA concentrations, or core flow rates between
0.09 and 0.1 mL h–1, if the BSA concentrations were
between 19 and 20% (w/v). Because both encapsulation efficiency and
size are dependent on the combination of core flow rate and BSA concentration,
an overlapping region with core flow rate 0.02–0.035 mL h–1 and 10–12% w/v BSA concentration can be identified,
wherein the encapsulation efficiency is maximum and the size target
can be met.

2.4 Preparation of Cell-Laden
Microcapsules
The relationships demonstrated in Figures 2–4 provided
a detailed understanding of the main operating parameters for the
fabrication of uniform, cell-laden microcapsules in high yields. On
the basis of this analysis, a BSA concentration of 10% w/v, core flow
rate of 0.02 mL h–1, PLGA concentration of 10% w/v,
shell solvent ratio of 97:3 v/v chloroform/DMF, and shell flow rate
of 0.5 mL h–1 were selected as the operating parameters
for cell encapsulation. Core–shell particles were then fabricated
using these parameters to validate the statistical model. Because
this experiment was carried out to evaluate the practicality and the
feasibility of core–shell particle fabrication, cells were
not added to the core solution. Instead, red silica microspheres were
added to the core solution to be encapsulated instead of cells. The
fabricated core–shell particles were then collected and suspended
in an optimum cutting temperature gel. The gel was frozen at −70
°C and sectioned via a cryosectioning machine. These sectioned
particles were mounted on a glass slide and imaged via scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). These
images were used to qualitatively evaluate the outcome of this experiment. Figure 5 presents the images
obtained from EHD jetting of core–shell particles and their
internal architecture.

CLSM image of the Texas red channel, showing the BSA core layer containing

containing a silica microsphere; (c-2) SEM image of cross-sectioned
PLGA layer; (c-3) SEM image of cross-sectioned PLGA layer; and (c-4)
SEM image of cross-sectioned BSA layer.

As evident from the images displayed in Figure 5, core–shell particles
were successfully
fabricated using the parameters derived from the aforementioned analysis.
From the SEM image, it can be deduced that the microparticles have
been fabricated in high yields (Figure 5A). The CLSM images along with cross-sectional SEM
images reveal the success of core–shell particle formation
and their morphology. In CLSM images, red silica microspheres and
blue dye were used as the markers for the core and shell, respectively
(Figure 5B). Figure 5C presents the SEM
images of the sectioned particles after cryosectioning. It is evident
that the silica microspheres have been successfully encapsulated within
the BSA layer to form the core, and the core has been entrapped within
the PLGA shell.

2.5 Cell Viability
After ensuring the
synthesis of core–shell particles, microencapsulation of live
NIH3T3 fibroblast cells was investigated. The core and shell solutions
were prepared as explained in detail in the Section 4 and fabricated using the parameters obtained
from the DOE analysis. The polymeric shell solution contained a blue
dye, and NIH3T3 cells were stained with the live/dead assay. The particles
were jetted into a solution of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) to ensure that the cells would survive. Figure 6 presents the data obtained
through this analysis.

cells with PLGA (blue dye) shell and BSA core layers.

Figure 6A presents
the confocal images of the cell-loaded core–shell particles.
An examination of the fluorescent signals of blue and green dyes using
flow cytometry reveals that 76.2% of the cells were alive and had
been successfully encapsulated in the core. Figure 6B shows the dot plot of the particles wherein
the control microparticles, negative for the green signal, fell in
the lower left quadrant. Microparticles loaded with stained cells
were confined in the upper two quadrants characterized by their fluorescence
signal. This evaluation is also proof of the viability of cells after
encapsulation and shows that the cells were capable of withstanding
the applied voltage. Figure 7 shows the confocal images obtained before and after microencapsulation
of stained cells. Figure 7A shows the stained NIH3T3 cells before entrapment in microcapsules.
The color green represents live cells and red represents the dead
ones. Figure 7B demonstrates
the stained NIH3T3 cells after microencapsulation in PLGA core–shell
particles.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a modified
electrospraying approach was successfully
utilized to fabricate core–shell particles encapsulating live
cells. The effect of each jetting parameter on encapsulation efficiency,
yield, and size was studied systematically using DOE methodology.
Contour plots of the relationship between each response and the most
dominant affecting experimental factors were displayed. It was demonstrated
that the interactions between BSA concentration and core flow rate
is the most dominant factor affecting core encapsulation efficiency
and size of the core–shell particles. Furthermore, it was shown
that the interaction between shell solvent ratio and shell flow rate
is the most dominant factor affecting the yield of core–shell
particles. We further identified the optimum operating parameters
for core–shell particles synthesis: 10% w/v BSA concentration,
0.02 mL h–1 core flow rate, 10% w/v PLGA concentration,
97:3 chloroform/DMF v/v solvent ratio, and 0.5 mL h–1 shell flow rate. For proof of concept, NIH3T3 cells were successfully
encapsulated in core–shell microparticles using the parameters
obtained from the DOE analysis. It was shown that the cells were alive
and able to withstand the applied electric potential during EHD jetting.
In the future, cell delivery via microencapsulation of cells in biodegradable,
semi-impermeable particles may have applications in tissue engineering,
regenerative medicine, as well as vehicles for the production and
secretion of hormones and growth factors, such as insulin.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA, 50:50 lactic acid to glycolic acid
ratio,
and molecular weight (Mw) of 44 kDa) was
purchased from Corbin (Lenexa, KS). BSA, chloroform, DMF, Tween 20,
and poly[(m-phenylenevinylene)-alt-(2,5-dihexyloxy-p-phenylenevinylene)] (MEHPV) were
obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and used as received.
m-PEG-rhodamine (5 kDa) was used as received from Creative PEGWorks
(Chapel Hill, NC), and the OCT compound was purchased from Fisher
HealthCare (Houston, TX). The mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line,
NIH3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Calcein AM and
ethidium homodimer were both purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad,
CA). DMEM and tryspin were obtained from Gibco (Grand Island, NY).

4.2 Preparation of Jetting Solutions
PLGA was
dissolved in a solvent consisting of chloroform and DMF
to be used as the shell. The formulation of this polymeric solution
was varied in accordance with the DOE matrix outlined in Section 2.4 (Table 1). BSA was dissolved in the
water/rhodamine mixture, and the resulting solvent was used as the
core solution, with its formulation varied in accordance with the
DOE matrix (Table 1) to optimize the particle formulation. After the particle formulation
was optimized, the core solution was replaced with NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts
suspended in a 10% Matrigel (Corning, NY) solution at a concentration
of 2 million cells/mL. These NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were cultured
under standard conditions at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

The Matrigel was diluted in DMEM (4.5 g/mL) containing 4 mM l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin–streptomycin,
and 1% MEM nonessential amino acids (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). The
samples were washed with PBS and resuspended in a solution of DMEM
and 10% Matrigel.

4.3 EHD Cojetting
A coaxial needle system,
which consisted of a 25-gauge needle centered within an 18-gauge needle,
was used to synthesize the core–shell microparticles. The PLGA
solution was loaded into the outer needle to make the shell of the
particles, and the BSA solution was loaded into the central needle
to make the particle core. The flow rates for both the PLGA and BSA
solutions were varied according to the DOE matrix (Table 1). After the respective solutions
were loaded into the needles, a voltage was applied until a stable
Taylor cone was formed, as illustrated in Figure 1. A voltage of 10–12 kV was used for
all experiments. For the DOE analysis, microparticles were deposited
onto a metal sheet and placed in vacuum to dry. For cellular encapsulation,
the particles were jetted into DMEM. The solution was then passed
through a 40 μm filter followed by a 20 μm filter and
then centrifuged at 3000 rpm. The purified particles were then resuspended
in DMEM.

4.4 Formulating the Experimental Design for Microencapsulation
of Cells
A half-fraction factorial design with five experimental
factors and two levels was used to explore the experimental space
and obtain optimal operating parameters. Table 1 illustrated the model parameters used in
the construction of the experimental space. The experimental factors
are the inputs of the design. Core encapsulation efficiency, yield,
and size identify the outputs or the response of the experimental
design.

This combination of parameters gave rise to the 16 unique
experimental combinations used to map the experimental space. The
experimental run order was randomized to minimize bias and ensure
that the data points were independent. This elimination was done to
avoid convolution of the model.

4.5 Characterization
of Jetted Microparticles
Microparticles were imaged with
a CLSM using a Nikon A-1 spectral
microscope and SEM (Amray 1910 FE-SEM) at the University of Michigan’s
Microscopy and Imaging Laboratory facilities. For the purpose of the
DOE analysis, the samples for confocal and SEM imaging were obtained
by placing a microscope cover glass and a silicon chip on the collectors’
metal sheet during EHD cojetting. In the case of cellular encapsulation,
these samples were obtained from the solution after the centrifugation
step outlined in Section 4.3. The sample was then mounted in 7 μL of prolong gold
(Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) before the confocal analysis. In DOE analysis,
confocal images were used to ensure the fabrication of the core–shell
particles for each combination of parameters according to the DOE
matrix outlined in Section 2.4 (Table 1).
The SEM images were used to confirm particle formation and to measure
the diameter of microparticles. This measurement was done using Image-J
software.31−33 For cellular encapsulation, confocal images were
used to ensure successful cell encapsulation as determined by staining
with a live/dead assay kit. To demonstrate the internal core–shell
geometry of these particles, SEM images of microparticles sectioned
into 30 μm sections were used.

Furthermore, for the purposes
of the DOE analysis, the yield was determined by collecting the microparticles
and dispersing them in a solution of 0.1% PBS and Tween 20. These
particles were analyzed using a hemocytometer and the actual concentration
of particles per mass of PLGA jetted was calculated.

Core–shell
microparticles suspended in PBS with 0.1% Tween
20 were analyzed by flow cytometry at the University of Michigan flow
laboratory. The data obtained from flow cytometry was evaluated to
determine the core encapsulation efficiency using the percentage of
particles that had both red and blue dyes associated with them. In
cellular encapsulation, the control group of particles (no cell encapsulated)
and particles encapsulating NIH3T3-GFP cells were prepared as stated
and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the cell encapsulation
efficiency. For data analysis, the MoFlo Astrios software was used.

4.6 Cell Viability
The cell viability
was evaluated by confocal microscopy using calcein AM and ethidium
homodimer. First, the cells were passaged at 80% confluence using
0.25% tryspin, which was neutralized with a three-fold excess of the
complete medium. The cells were then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min at 4 °C. Next, the cell pellet was washed in Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and then pelleted using centrifugation.
The cells were then treated with a solution of 1 μM calcien
AM and 2 μM ethidium homodimer in DPBS for 20 min at room temperature.
The cells were rinsed three times before suspending them in the core
solution, which contained 2 μM ethidium homodimer to track changes
in cell viability within the particles after encapsulation.

4.7 Statistical Analysis
Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to identify both the main and the interaction
effects significant in each response. This analysis was conducted
at 95% confidence level (5% significance). Insignificant main and
interaction parameters were systematically eliminated from the model
and a contour plot of each refined model was constructed. ANOVA calculations
were all performed using Minitab statistical package (State College,
PA).
