A new three-dimensional
microporous metal–organic framework
based on Zn(II) clusters with the formula {[Zn7(NDC)5.5(μ4-OH)3]·7DMF}n (1) (H2NDC = 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid) had been synthesized and characterized. The MOF 1 displays an uncommon bsn topology, which is based on a unique heptanuclear
Zn7(OH)3(CO2)11 cluster
as a secondary building unit. The MOF had been employed as a photocatalyst
for the photodegradation of model organic dyes rhodamine B and methyl
violet in light. The results of photocatalytic experiments showed
that 1 can successfully be employed as the photocatalyst
for the benign decomposition of these dyes. A mechanism for the photcatalysis
exhibited by 1 had been proposed using the results of
density of states (DOS) and partial DOS calculations. The fluorescence
properties of the MOF have been investigated, which revealed that 1 could be exploited as the luminescent sensor to recognize
Fe3+ ions with perceptible quenching (Ksv = 6.55 × 104 M–1)
and a limit of detection of 1.16 ppm.

Introduction
Recently, as a subclass
of coordination polymers, metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures have been considered to be
capable of absorbing light radiation, because of which these systems
behave as promising photocatalysts.1,2 The preliminary
investigation on such systems was focused on the photocatalytic activity
associated with MOF-5 for the degradation of phenol in ultraviolet
(UV) light.3 Later, the usage of MOFs as
a photocatalyst have been focused on the safe and sustainable degradation
of organic contaminants, for example, a porous MOF, UTSA-38, with
[Zn4O(2,6-ndc)3(DMF)1.5(H2O)0.5] units had been utilized in photodegrading methyl
orange (MO) in aqueous medium.4 In addition,
a stable material, UiO-66(NH2), displayed visible-light-responsive
photocatalysis for decomposing organic dyes.5 Numerous examples have confirmed that the optical properties of
MOFs can be tuned to improve their light-harvesting properties, and
hence they can act as hosts for other photosensitive molecules.5b Duan and co-workers have suggested that MOF-based
photocatalysts on the basis of their active fragments can be classified
into three categories: (i) the 0D inorganic cluster nodes containing
MOFs, which behave like semiconductor dot photocatalysts, usually
described as isolated semiconductor dots; (ii) the functional dye-based
photocatalysts composed of linkers, which are alternatively termed
as heterogeneous dye-based photocatalysts; and (iii) the photocatalytic
MOFs that contain different pores that are taken as regularly distributed
supramolecular systems.5e,5f Despite many interesting
reports, this research field is still considered to be an emerging
area as many important concerns associated with the MOFs, viz. activity,
efficiency, and stability, need additional exhaustive investigation.5c

The luminescent MOFs (LMOFs) have been
considered as outstanding
sensors due to their intriguing structural feature and detectable
fluorescence properties, which can be clearly altered.6 Li and co-workers first reported an LMOF that was capable
of detecting traces of explosives in the vapor phase.7 To obtain an efficient sensor to detect various analytes,
the rational design and syntheses of targeted MOFs have been creating
interest among chemists involved in the syntheses of coordination
polymers/MOFs. A general strategy that is utilized to make targeted
MOF-based materials is the careful designing of the ligands, which
can give rise to desired metal clusters. In this context, some simple
organic aromatic carboxylic ligands (e.g., 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid) are appropriate candidates for the preparation of new LMOFs.
Some recent reports have indicated that the luminescent behavior in
LMOFs usually arises due to different electronic transitions, viz.
ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT), ligand-to-metal charge transfer
(LMCT), metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT), and metal-to-metal
charge transfer (MMCT). Also, the luminescence sensing of the analytes
by LMOFs arises because of the Förster resonance energy transfer
(FRET), Dexter electron exchange (DEE), and photoinduced electron
transfer (PET). Although examples of MOFs with diversified topology
are numerous, but MOFs composed of microporous voids and possessing
good thermal stability with strong luminescent properties, which are
based on host–guest chemistry, are less reported.7

A previous report indicated that the photocatalytic
properties
in MOFs are arising due to their structures, which include their topological
features, pore size, and structural stability.8 To prepare targeted MOFs with desired topology, pore size, and stability,
an aromatic dicarboxylate ligand, 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate (NDC),
is usually selected as a possible ligand system. This is because the
rodlike NDC ligand possesses an interesting feature that favors the
formation of versatile coordination (Scheme 1). Moreover, the metal ions are coordinated
through polytopic multicarboxylate linkages, which thereby results
in M–O–C-type clusters in which the carboxylate carbon
groups are capable of modulating the shape of the secondary building
unit (SBU). Yaghi et al. proposed such strategy and successfully synthesized
two three-dimensional (3D) metal carboxylate frameworks constructed
by linking Zn(II) centers to the NDC ligand and m-benzenedicarboxylate ligand to yield MOF-48 and MOF-49, respectively.10 The two MOFs exhibited pentagonal antiprismatic
and cuboctahedral SBUs.9 Later, it has
been found that the Zn(II) assemblies composed of multicarboxylate
ligands are suitable in producing various types of clusters, viz.
Zn2, Zn3, Zn 4, Zn 5, Zn6, Zn7, Zn8, and Zn9.9−11

Presented in This Study
As part of our continuous effort in this direction,12 in the presented work, NDC was selected as the
ligand to coordinate with Zn(II) ions to construct a new MOF with
the formula {[Zn7(NDC)5.5(μ4-OH)3]·7DMF}n (1) within an appropriate template reagent. The newly synthesized
MOF possess a heptanuclear Zn7(OH)3(CO2)11 cluster as the SBU. The MOF 1 not only
possesses interesting topology but also displayed photocatalytic activity
against organic dye degradation and sensing properties for ferric
ions. The results of these investigations are presented in this report.

Results
and Discussion
Crystal Structure Description
{[Zn7(NDC)5.5(μ4-OH)3]·7DMF}n (1)
The single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies indicated that 1 displays
a 3D framework, which encompasses 1D channels along
the [010] direction. These 1D channels are occupied by free dimethylformamide
(DMF) molecules. The MOF is composed of a heptazinc secondary building
unit (SBU) with 11 peripheral carboxylates, which is different from
the SBU existing in the Zn7(m-BDC)6(OH)4(H2O)2·6DMF·4H2O (MOF-49) (m-BDC = 1,3-benzenedicarboxylate)
entity containing 10 carboxylates. Additionally, the SBU for 1 is different in comparison to other heptazinc SBUs, viz.
[(CH3)2NH2]2[Zn7(μ4-O)2(NDC)6] and {(EMIM)2[Zn7(μ4-O)2(NDC)6]}n,11h,11k as both the previously reported SBUs had been assembled by utilizing
two equivalent oxygen-centered [Zn4(μ4-O)] tetrahedrons with 10 NDC ligands. In MOF 1, the
seven Zn(II) centers are connected together by two μ4-OH groups and capped by 11 carboxylate groups from 11 NDC ligands
(Figure S1). The NDC ligands exhibit μ4-η1:η1 η1:η1 and μ4-η1:η2 η1:η1 modes in 1 (Scheme 1), which
is similar with that of the previous reports (Table 1).11 In addition,
there is one terminal −OH group coordinated with one Zn(II)
as a charge balanced part of Zn7(μ4-OH)3(CO2)11 (Figure 1a,b). After carefully analyzing the SBU,
it can be inferred that in addition to the five Zn(II) centers with
a tetrahedral geometry (Zn1, Zn2, Zn4, Zn6, and Zn7), one five-coordinated Zn(II)
with a trigonal bipyramidal geometry (Zn3) and another
Zn(II) with an octahedral geometry (Zn5) also exist in
the SBU (Figure 1b
and Figure S1). The Zn···Zn
distance in the SBU is in the range 3.13–3.27 Å, indicating
no significant interactions between Zn(II) centers. The capping hydroxyl
oxygen centers are lying slightly above (0.62 Å) and below the
Zn cluster plane with ca. 338° sum of angles around O2. The 11
peripheral NDC ligands around the SBU in 1 can be divided
into six groups; 10 NDC ligands are classified into five groups of
two ligands each, while the eleventh NDC ligand is classified as a
separate group as it is disordered over two positions. Each group
bridges the SBU with another SBU, so the Zn7(OH)3(CO2)11 SBU extended out to six other SBUs
through these ligands (Figure 1c). In this manner, a 3D three-periodic MOF with bsn topology
is constructed with these six-connected SBU and NDC ligands (Figure 1d–f and Figure S2). The face-to-face and centroid···centroid
distances between lateral and middle rings are ∼3.58 and 3.81
Å, respectively, which indicates substantial π···π
interaction. It has been observed the assemblies of Zn(II)/Co(II)
with the NDC ligand are suitable to form a variety of cluster systems,
viz. Zn2, Zn3, Zn4, Zn5, Zn6, Zn7, and Zn8 (Table 1), and such MOFs have been used as photocatalysts,
sensors, and magnetic materials.11 It should
be noted that some complexes possessing the heptanuclear [Zn7(μ4-O)(μ2-COO)10] SBU
with one octahedral and six tetrahedral zinc centers had been constructed
using mixed coligands. The sites of the heptanuclear cores are occupied
by a terminal and/or bridging nitrogen center containing ligands.11k The MOF 1 is composed of a window
of channels along the a direction with a diameter
of 3.75 Å. In addition, a cavity with a diameter of about 6.7
Å can be found in these channels (Figure 1e). Also, 1 exhibits 33.8% porosity
when calculated with a probe radius of 1.8 Å. The MOF was activated
using high vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h before nitrogen sorption
isotherm test was executed at 77 K. The adsorption isotherm for the
MOF 1 demonstrated typical type I sorption characteristics
(Figure S6). The small uptake of nitrogen
at 77 K and at atmospheric pressure indicated that the pore channels
in the MOF are pre-occupied because of the orientation of the naphthalene
ring toward the inward direction of the pores.11k,12

FTIR, Powder X-Ray Diffraction, and Thermal Stability Analyses
The FTIR spectrum for 1 display bands at 1666, 1557,
1421, 1366, and 1256 cm–1, which corresponds to
the NDC ligand (Figure S3). The band around
3200 cm–1 can be attributed to the hydroxyl groups.
In the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern for 1,
the main peak positions are almost consistent with the simulated pattern.
However, the additional peaks in the PXRD pattern at 2θ = 12°
and 21° did not exist in the simulated PXRD pattern, which indicates
that 1 is mixed with other crystalline phases (Figure S4). The intensity differences in the
PXRD pattern may be arising because of the differences in the orientations
of the microcrystalline material in the finely divided powder.

The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for MOF 1 exhibited
weight loss in three distinct steps (Figure S5). The first weight loss commenced at room temperature and ended
at 205 °C, which agrees well with the loss of free DMF molecules
(24.1%; calcd 23.3%). The second weight loss from 230–290 °C
can be ascribed to the decomposition of the hydroxyl groups and two
NDC ligands, and finally the third weight loss can be attributed to
the remaining NDC ligands, leading to the formation of ZnO (28.6%;
calcd 26.5%).

UV–vis and Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
The UV–vis spectroscopy for 1 had been performed
in the solid state at room temperature (Figure S7). The UV–vis spectrum indicated a band at 316 nm,
which may be arising because of the π → π* transition
taking place in the NDC ligand. Additionally, diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy for 1 was also performed. The Kubelka–Munk
equation had been used to correlate the absorption coefficients of
the allowed band gap in 1. The band gap energy (Eg) of 3.5 eV for MOF 1 had been
calculated by extrapolating the linear region of absorption edge (Figure S7b). Therefore, the diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy indicates that MOF 1 possesses potential
to act as a photocatalyst for photodegradation.13−17

Photocatalysis
Crystals can be seen
as a small bulk
that grew in a spherical pattern in few micrometer (2–30 μm)
sizes (Figure S7). On the basis of the
band gap energy, it can be inferred that 1 can behave
as a semiconductor on exposure to light and therefore can act as a
photocatalyst.18,19 Therefore, to assess the suitability
of 1 as a photocatalyst to photodegrade aromatic dyes,
two model organic dyes (MV and Rh B) were selected as model aromatic
dyes, which exists as pollutants in aqueous medium. In the typical
photocatalytic process, 20 mg of the photocatalyst (MOF 1) was suspended in 250 mL aqueous solutions of MV or Rh B with a
concentration of 1.5 × 10–5 M. Thereafter,
the mixture was stirred in the dark for ∼30 min to establish
an adsorption/desorption equilibrium. Thereafter, these mixtures were
then exposed to UV light by using a 400 W Hg lamp with continuous
stirring of the solution. After every 5 min time intervals, aliquots
of 5 mL were taken out from the reaction mixture, and their UV–vis
spectra were recorded. Also, the photodegradation of MV and Rh B without
adding photocatalyst 1 was also studied for comparison
under identical reaction conditions. The results of photocatalysis
displayed by 1 are presented in Figure 2. The plots between Ct/C0 for MV and Rh B versus reaction
time (wherein C0 is the initial concentration
of the MV or Rh B and Ct is t time’s concentration of the dye) have been constructed (Figure 2b,d), which indicate
that under strong illumination by a 400 W Hg lamp, the model organic
dyes MV and Rh B underwent decomposition to some extent even in the
absence of photocatalyst 1. However, in the presence
of 1, the shortened photodegradation time indicates that 1 is an effective catalyst that can be used to decompose MV
and Rh B under UV light irradiation. A control experiment on the photodegradation
of MV and Rh B was conducted in the same condition without light irradiation
(Figure S9). There is no obvious change
in the degradation of dyes without light irradiation, which indicated
that the presence of light irradiation is important for the efficient
degradation of dyes. Some MOFs were examined as photocatalysts to
degrade organic pollutants under UV, visible, or UV–vis light. Table S2 lists some of these MOFs, which showed
good photocatalytic performances for the degradation of organic pollutants.
After photocatalysis experiments, 1 was filtered and
characterized using PXRD (Figure S4) and
IR (Figure S3). The results of PXRD and
IR indicated nearly identical PXRD pattern and IR bands as can be
obtained for the as-synthesized 1. Based on current results,
the repeated photocatalytic degradation of MV was explored, and the
degradation rates of 1 exhibited no significant decrease
when the photocatalyst was used five times in the same condition,
which indicated that the photocatalytic activities have well reproducibility
(Figure S10).

absorption spectra of the MV/Rh B solution

The photocatalytic mechanism is complicated, which usually
involves
the generation of OH· radical in the reaction mixture
for photodegradation.18 Hence, to check
whether there is involvement of OH· radical in the
degradation process or not, the photocatalytic reactions were carried
under the same reaction conditions using 1 along with
thiourea, which is considered to be a good OH· scavenger.
The results of this experiment indicated that the catalytic activity
associated with 1 disappeared (Figure S11). Therefore, it had been inferred that OH· radicals play a key role for the degradation of aromatic dyes. During
photocatalysis, in the presence of UV–vis light, the electronic
excitation take place from HOMO → LUMO in photocatalyst 1 to produce oxygen–metal charge transfer. This excited
state gets deactivated by oxidizing the pollutants and/or oxidizing
the water molecules to OH· radicals to accomplish
the photocatalytic process (Scheme S1).19

To establish the mechanism for MOF 1 assisted degradation
of dyes under irradiation, the density of states calculations based
on DFT (density functional theory) have been performed to assess the
band structure of 1 (Figure 3). As indicated in Figure 3, the aromatic carbon centers and oxygen
centers of the carboxylate groups are the major contributors in the
valence band of the MOF. In addition, the band is also having meagre
contribution from zinc centers. The conduction band of the MOF in
the range of −0.97 to −0.44 eV is again having contribution
from carbon centers in major and with minor contribution coming from
oxygen. Hence, density of states plots indicate that electronic transitions
in the MOF is operating from one naphthalene center to other naphthalene
center (ligand-to-ligand) with some additional contribution from carboxylate
oxygens.

Figure 3 Density of states (DOS) and partial DOS plots for MOF.

In other words, during photoexcitation, there is
an occurrence
of charge transfer from HOMO → LUMO to generate a hole at the
HOMO. The electron-deficient HOMO will now strongly require an electron
to revert back to the ground state. Therefore, an electron is captured
by the photoexcited MOF from the water molecule, which therefore produces
the ·OH radical. These ·OH radicals
are capable of decomposing the organic dye efficiently to accomplish
the photocatalytic decomposition. The plausible mechanistic pathway
that may be operating during the photodecomposition of dyes in the
presence of 1 can be presented as follows20−22 1   2   3   4   5  

Luminescence Sensing
The LMOFs are attracting research
interest as luminescent materials as they offer application as ion
sensors.23 With this aspect in mind, the
suspension of MOF 1 was treated with different metal
nitrate solutions with concentrations of 10–2 M,
and thereafter luminescence intensity measurements for all the Mn+@1 suspensions were done (Figure 4a and Figure S12). The experiments revealed that the
luminescent intensity of Mn+@1 vary with the change in the nature of the Mn+ cation. In most of the Mn+@1 suspensions (especially Pb2+ and Cd2+), the luminescence intensity of 1 was almost unaltered,
while in Fe3+@1, the quenching in the luminescence
intensity was observed. Alternatively, it can be stated that Fe3+ ions displayed a maximum alleviating effect on the luminescent
intensity of the MOF 1, which almost lead to quenching
in emission (Figure 4a).

Figure 4 (a) Photoluminescence intensity of suspension of 1 in
the presence of different 10–2 M metal ion
solutions (λex = 320 nm). (b) Emissive response of 1 when variable concentrations of Fe3+ solutions
were added. (c) Stern–Volmer plot for Fe3+@1.

The luminescent intensity of 1 declined to the maximum
extent in the presence of Fe3+ ions. Hence, luminescent
intensity measurements for MOF 1 on incremental addition
of Fe3+ (in parts per million (ppm)) have been executed
(Figure 4b), and using
this titration experiment, the Stern–Volmer (S-V) curve had
been plotted (Figure 4c). The S-V plot for Fe3+ is almost linear when the Fe3+ concentration is low with the Ksv value of 6.55 × 104 M–1 (Figure 4c). The Ksv value of Fe3+ reported in the presented
work is as good as those previously reported for LMOFs (Table S1).23−29 On the basis of the S-V plot, the limit of detection (LOD) for Fe3+ is 1.16 ppm. It had been documented that the Fe3+ cations compete to absorb light radiation with organic molecules
and hence can decrease the extent of energy transfer that is taking
place from the ligand toward the ions. To validate this, the electronic
absorption spectrum for the H2NDC ligand was recorded,
which displayed λmax at 256 nm. This band is largely
overlapped by the electronic absorption band of Fe3+ (Figure S13). Hence, on excitation, there will
be competitive absorption of radiation between Fe3+ and
the NDC ligand in between 250 and 350 nm. On the basis of this spectral
overlap analyses, the quenching behavior in Fe3+@1 may be ascribed to be arising because of the photoinduced
electron transfer. Furthermore, the luminescence lifetime of 8.36
ns in 1 was reduced to 3.81 ns when 1.0 mM Fe3+ solution was added to it (Figure S14).
Therefore, the lifetime measurements further suggest that Fe3+ ions are incorporated into the defect sites in 1.

Additionally, to explicate the plausible mechanism for the observed
quenching in the luminescence of 1 by Fe3+ ions, O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed
on 1 and Fe3+@1 (Figure S15). The O 1s peaks for the oxygen centers
observed at 530.79 eV in 1 shifted to 531.66 eV for Fe3+@1 (Figure S15b).
These results indicate the Fe3+ ions may bind with the
bridging hydroxyl groups and the carboxylate oxygens, which may also
be responsible for the emission quenching in 1.

Conclusions
A new Zn(II)-based 3D metal–organic framework with bsn topology
embracing cuboctahedral secondary building units had been derived
from 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (H2NDC). The MOF 1 displayed photocatalytic properties to photodecompose model
organic dyes MV and Rh B under UV irradiation. In addition, the MOF
is a selective and sensitive sensor for ferric ions with reasonably
good Ksv values and low limits of detection.
Our investigation indicated that by changing the stoichiometric ratio
between same metal salts and ligands and also altering the reaction
conditions, a new 3D architecture in MOFs can be obtained, which possess
various topologies and different kinds of channels. Such strategy
is useful in developing MOFs that offers tunable luminescence properties
and thus can be used as sensors for the detection of ions/molecules
and also be utilized as a heterogeneous photocatalyst for the decomposition
of organic dyes.
