It is expected that
single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have
high thermal conductivity along the tube axis and that the thermal
conductivities depend on their structure, such as length, diameter,
chirality (n, m), and so forth.
Although many experimental measurements of the thermal conductivity
have been reported, the SWCNT structure was not characterized sufficiently.
In particular, the chirality was not assigned, and it was not confirmed
whether SWCNT was isolated or not (bundled with multiplicate SWCNTs).
Therefore, measured values widely vary (101 to 104 W/(m·K)) so far. Here, we measured the thermal conductivity
of chirality-assigned SWCNTs, which were individually suspended, by
using photoluminescence (PL) imaging spectroscopy. The temperature
distribution along the tube axis was obtained, and the temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity was measured in a wide-temperature
range (from 350 to 1000 K). For (9, 8) SWCNTs with 10–12 μm
in length, the thermal conductivity was 1166 ± 243 W/(m·K)
at 400 K. The proposed PL imaging spectroscopy enables to measure
the thermal conductivity of SWCNTs with high precision and without
any contacts, and it is an effective method in the temperature distribution
measurements of nanomaterials.

1 Introduction
Because
of the recent development of integration technologies,
the heat-generation density in electric devices rapidly increases,
and the management of thermal transport becomes an urgent issue. To
improve and control the thermal transport, new materials that possess
novel thermal properties are needed and nanomaterials are an excellent
candidate. Their properties generally depend on crystal structure,
size in nanoscale, and morphology, and the desired thermal properties
can be realized by the combination of structure-designed nanomaterials.

In particular, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are the
nanomaterials that attract attention. It is known that SWCNT has high
thermal conductivity along the tube axis, and the high thermal conductivity
is anticipated for thermal management of devices. The dependence of
thermal properties on the tube diameter, length, and chirality is
theoretically discussed.1 By contrast,
experimental measurements for individual SWCNTs are extremely difficult,
and their thermal properties are unclear. The thermal conductivity
measurement of suspended SWCNTs has been performed by Joule-heating
method,2 steady-state method,3,4 and the temperature dependence of the G-band.5 That of SWCNTs on substrates has been also performed by
3ω method.6 The obtained values of
the thermal conductivity diverge because they are affected by the
assumed temperatures distribution,2,5,6 the contact thermal resistance,3,4 the
temperature dependence of the electric resistance,2,6 and
so on. In addition, the characterization of SWCNTs for the thermal
property measurement is not sufficient, and only one measurement of
chirality-assigned SWCNT4 is reported.
Because the physical properties of SWCNTs strongly depend on their
chirality, the thermal properties have to be measured from SWCNTs
that are fully characterized. Because SWCNTs are chemically stable
and they can be applied to devices at high temperatures, the thermal
properties and their temperature dependence in a high-temperature
range are also important.

In this study, we used a long suspended
SWCNT that was fully characterized
by optical spectroscopic methods and measured the temperature distribution
and thermal conductivity along the tube axis by photoluminescence
(PL) imaging spectroscopies. The PL imaging spectroscopy made it possible
to measure the local temperature of SWCNTs in a wide temperature range
without contacts or destruction. PL and Raman scattering spectroscopy
determined the chirality, diameter, and crystallinity of the measured
SWCNTs and confirmed that they were singly isolated (not bundled).

2 Methods
PL cannot be observed from SWCNTs on a substrate.7 Therefore, we performed PL measurements using
individual
SWCNTs suspended between silica micropillars. The distance between
the pillars was 10–12 μm, and the height of the pillar
was 18 μm. The surface of the silica substrate, except for the
top area of the pillars, was covered with a thin silicon layer of
40 nm thickness. Catalytic metals were alloyed with silicon and lost
their catalysis. Thus, the SWCNTs were grown from only the pillar
top area, and we could obtain the information from perfectly individual
SWCNTs. SWCNTs were grown by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
using cobalt (Co) catalyst. The Co thin film with a nominal thickness
of 0.1 Å was deposited with a vacuum evaporator. The substrate
was heated up to 870 °C in Ar/H2 mixture gas (3% H2 by volume) for the preparation of catalyst nanoparticles.
After that, ethanol gas was flown as the carbon source while keeping
the temperature. The CVD growth time was 10 min. The diameter of SWCNTs
grown by this CVD process was about 1 nm.

PL and Raman scattering
from suspended SWCNTs were excited with
a Ti:sapphire tunable laser. The excitation wavelength for PL spectroscopy
ranged from 700 to 850 nm, whereas that for Raman scattering spectroscopy
was fixed at 785 nm. The PL and Raman spectra were detected by InGaAs
and charge-coupled device photodetectors, respectively. We used PL
imaging spectroscopy to measure spatially resolved PL spectra. The
laser spot size (full width at half maximum, fwhm) of the excitation
light was 10.87 μm [the dispersion of laser (σlaser) is 4.61 μm], which was larger enough for the irradiation
of whole-suspended SWCNTs. The total absorption energy of the whole-suspended
SWCNT (I0) is 1  where (xc, yc) is the center position of laser and L0 is the total power of the laser. L and dtube are the length and tube diameter
of the SWCNT, respectively. x- and y-axes are parallel and perpendicular to the tube axis, respectively.
The PL images from the SWCNTs were acquired with an InGaAs two-dimensional
(2D) photodetector,7 when the bandpass
wavelength of an acousto-optical tunable filter was changed at every
5 nm from 1300 to 1400 nm. The pixel size of the 2D photodetector
was 600 × 600 nm2.

The temperature dependence
of PL emission wavelength was measured
from suspended SWCNTs between a trench (the width was 1.2–2.4
μm) on a thermally oxidized silicon substrate. The suspended
SWCNTs were directly grown over the trenches by the same CVD method
as that for the silica micropillars. PL spectra were measured with
changing the temperature in vacuum. The silicon substrate was directly
heated by Joule-heating method with ac voltage, whereas the substrate
temperature was monitored with a thermocouple. Because of high thermal
conductivity of silicon even at high temperature, the temperature
of silicon substrate was uniform. The power of the excitation laser
was 50 μW, and the spot size was 1.6 μm in diameter. The
low-power density avoided additional heating of SWCNTs. The temperature
distribution of suspended SWCNT along the axis was ignorable because
of the short length (1.2–2.4 μm) and low thermal resistance
between the SWCNT and silicon substrate.8 Therefore, it was ensured that the temperature of suspended SWCNTs
was equal to that of the silicon substrate.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a suspended SWCNT.
The suspended SWCNT was supported at both ends, which were connected
with the pillar tops. Therefore, the SWCNT length (L) was determined by the spacing between two pillars. Figure 1b shows the PL map of the suspended
SWCNT in air. The PL map was composed of PL emission spectra measured
with different excitation wavelength,9 and
it clearly shows the optical transition energy Eii of SWCNTs. The combination of excitation
and emission wavelengths determined the SWCNT chirality, and it was
(9, 8).10 The Eii showed no red shift which is caused by bundling,11 and there was no satellite peak which comes
from the defective structure.12 Therefore,
PL spectroscopy showed that the suspended SWCNT was perfectly isolated
(not bundled) and of high quality. Raman spectra from the identical
SWCNT are shown in Figure 1c. The single radial breathing mode (RBM) peak at 207 cm–1, G+ peak at 1597 cm–1 and G– peak at 1563 cm–1, was
clearly observed, whereas the D-band peak, which originates from defective
structure, was not detected around 1300 cm–1. The
combination of the wavenumber of RBM peak and the excitation wavelength
also determined that the chirality of SWCNTs was (9, 8), on the basis
of Kataura plot for suspended SWCNTs in air.13 Raman scattering spectroscopy revealed the chirality and quality
of the SWCNT, which agreed with those of PL spectroscopy.

and (c) Raman scattering spectra from the (9, 8) suspended SWCNT.

Figure 2a shows
the PL images from suspended (9, 8) SWCNTs through the tunable band-pass
filter with different wavelengths (1300–1400 nm). The excitation
wavelength was 720 nm. Although the whole part of the suspended SWCNT
emitted PL signals between the pillars, the emission intensity changed
along the tube axis depending on the band-pass wavelength. The nonuniformity
of PL emission wavelength will be discussed later. Figure 2b shows the relationship between
the intensity and the band-pass wavelength at the edge and center
positions of the SWCNT measured by PL imaging spectroscopy. The measured
data were fitted with a Lorentzian function, and it was regarded as
the local PL emission spectrum. At the edge and center, PL emission
wavelength was 1339.7 and 1355 nm, respectively. Figure 2c shows the colored PL image
obtained by PL imaging spectroscopy. The color and brightness were
calculated from the emission wavelength and the intensity of the local
PL emission spectra at each pixel. Blue and red colors were set at
1330 and 1360 nm, respectively, and the color was gradually changed
between them. PL imaging spectroscopy detected the distribution of
the local emission wavelength along the tube axis.

The emission wavelength depends
on stress,14 temperature,15 and the dielectric constant
around the SWCNTs.16,17 As shown in Figure 2c, the emission wavelength
was not uniform along the tube axis. The nonuniformity was investigated
focusing on the temperature distribution. Figure 3a shows the PL emission spectra measured
from suspended SWCNTs over Si trenches at different temperatures in
vacuum. PL emission energy decreased and the peak width increased. Figure 3b shows the temperature
dependence of emission energy shift measured for six different chiralities
of SWCNTs from 300 to 760 K. The temperature of the silicon substrate
was measured with the thermocouple, and the temperature is considered
to be uniform because of high thermal conductivity of silicon. It
is assumed that the SWCNT temperature is equal to that of the silicon
substrate.

Figure 3 Temperature dependence of PL spectra from SWCNTs. (a) PL spectra
measured at different temperatures from a (9, 7) SWCNT. (b) Peak energy
shift vs temperature.

The peak position of all chirality continuously shifted to
lower
energy as the temperature increases. The amount of energy shift ΔE follows the empirical formula of Varshni,18 2  where a is the constant and T0 corresponds to
the Debye temperature. The
black dotted line in Figure 3b is the result of fitting with the parameters a = 0.177 meV/K and T0 = 1800 K, which
is the Debye temperature of graphite at 600 K.19 All of the data from different chiralities are fitted well
with a single line. These data do not exhibit type-dependence,14 which means that the stress effect can be ignored.
Note that the temperature dependence has been measured in the lower
temperature range, and the value of a is reported
to be 0.075 meV/K.15 Water molecules adsorb
on the surface of suspended SWCNTs below the room temperature, and
they increase the dielectric constant and change Eii.20 On the
other hand, the temperature range of our measurements is above the
room temperature, and it was confirmed that water did not adsorb on
SWCNTs by PL spectroscopy. It is possible that the adsorption and
desorption of water make a difference in the temperature dependence
of PL emission wavelength in the low temperature range.

PL colored
images were measured from (9, 8) SWCNT with different
laser powers, as shown in Figure 4. The excitation laser wavelength was 720 nm. The sharpening
process was performed to correct the optical images. The details of
the sharpening processing can be found in the Supporting Information. The PL imaging measurements were performed
at about 10 Pa, where the heat transfers between air molecules and
the SWCNT could be ignored. The heat loss of the thermal radiation
from the SWCNT is also ignored because of the small surface area and
low temperature.

Figure 4 PL colored images of a (9, 8) suspended SWCNT obtained
with different
excitation laser powers I0. The scale
bar of PL images is 5 μm.

When I0 was 2.03 μW, the
PL emission
energy was almost uniform along the whole SWCNT, and it was about
1330 nm (930 meV). As I0 increased, the
emission energy at the center part shifted to a lower energy, whereas
the edge part did not change. At I0 =
4.15 μW, the emission energy of the center part reached about
1371 nm (905 meV), which is 25 meV lower than that at I0 = 2.03 μW. The emission energy down shifts at
higher temperature. Therefore, the nonuniformity of emission wavelength
and its laser-power dependence can be understood by the temperature
distribution along the tube axis.

As mentioned, SWCNTs are heated
by laser irradiation. The exciton
generated by the incident photon gradually relaxes with the scattering
of optical phonons in a few femtosecond and acoustic phonons in a
few picosecond,21 and then it reaches thermal
equilibrium. On the other hand, the group velocity of acoustic phonons
is ∼104 m/s, and the thermal energy travels ahead
∼101 nm in a few picosecond. Therefore, it is not
necessary to consider the nonthermal equilibrium state nor thermal
transports under laser irradiation.

We converted the distribution
of emission energy into the temperature
distribution along the tube axis on the basis of the temperature dependence
of emission energy by using eq 2. Figure 5a
shows the temperature distribution of SWCNT with different laser powers.
The x-axis is parallel to the tube axis, and the
center of SWCNT was at x = 0. The SWCNTs touched
the pillars at x = −6 and 6 μm because
the suspended length was 12 μm. The temperature difference between
the center and edge of SWCNT was about 80 K at I0 = 2.03 μW, and it increased to about 500 K at I0 = 4.15 μW.

Figure 5 (a) Temperature distribution
along the tube axis with different
irradiation laser powers (I0). (b) Temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity κ of (9, 8) SWCNTs with
different lengths.

If the laser power density
is uniform along the tube axis and the
temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of SWCNT, κ,
is negligible, the temperature distribution is exactly parabolic.
However, the temperature distribution, as shown in Figure 5, was not parabolic. Therefore,
the power density distribution of the excitation laser and the temperature
dependence of κ were considered. The power distribution of the
excitation laser is Gaussian, and the power density for SWCNTs, Plaser1D(x), is expressed by 3  

The κ of SWCNT
was calculated on the basis of the heat equation 4  where T(x) is the temperature distribution and A is the cross-sectional
area of SWCNT, A = πdtubeb with the van der Waals distance, b (3.4 Å). α is the absorption coefficient. In
the case of (9, 8) SWCNT, α at 720 nm was calculated to be 0.0560.22 In the calculation of α, E11 = 0.9270 eV and E22 = 1.590
eV, which are the optical transition energies of (9, 8) in vacuum,17 were used. Note that when the Eii changes with temperature, α
also changes. If the excitation energy is near the Eii, the α drastically changes with
temperature. However, because the energy of the excitation laser (1.72
eV) used here is far from the E22 of (9,
8) SWCNT, the temperature dependence of α is negligible. The
second derivative of T with respective to x was calculated from the temperature distribution, and
κ was calculated based on eq 4.

Figure 5b shows
the temperature dependence of κ obtained for the temperature
distribution caused by the excitation laser irradiation. The κ
clearly depends on the local temperature along the tube axis. Four
(9, 8) SWCNTs with different length (10 or 12 μm) were measured.
They showed the similar temperature dependence of κ, as shown
in Figure 5b, and the
thermal conductivity continuously decreases as the temperature increases.
The black circle plots were calculated from the temperature distribution
shown in Figure 5a.
The details of the other plots (green diamonds, blue squares, and
red triangles) can be found in the Supporting Information. The length dependence of the thermal conductivity
was theoretically predicted,23 and it was
expressed by κ ∝ Lp, where L is the SWCNT length and p is 1/3 in one dimension. Recent experimental paper reported
that p was 0.48 at most in the case of SWCNTs.24 Therefore, the length difference (10 and 12
μm) is ignored, and there was no clear length dependence of
κ in Figure 5b.

In general, Umklapp phonon–phonon scattering is a
dominant
factor on the thermal conductivity at high temperatures. As the temperature
increases, in addition to that of 3-phonon scattering, the contribution
of higher order phonon scattering processes to the thermal conductivity
appears. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity2,25 at high temperatures follows a simple Matthiessen’s rule
as 5  and the terms of T–1 and T–2 correspond to 3-phonon
and higher order phonon scattering processes, respectively. The experimental
data in Figure 5b are
well-fitted to this equation with c1 =
(1.90 ± 0.10) × 10–6 and c2 = (6.11 ± 2.10) × 10–10.
Taking into account the accuracy of α (20%),22 the thermal conductivity of (9, 8) SWCNTs was obtained
to be 1166 ± 243 W/(m·K) at 400 K. We can see that the term
of T–1 is dominant in the measurement
temperature range, and the feature of the temperature dependence of
κ is similar to the previous research for an SWCNT with 1.7
nm diameter.2 Note that the thermal conductivity
obtained here is relatively lower than some of the previously reported
ones.2,3 However, our measurement was performed for
the fully characterized and multiplicate (9, 8) SWCNTs with high precision
(the measurement error was 21%). Therefore, we believe that our measurement
and results are reliable.

4 Conclusions
We obtained
the temperature distribution of (9, 8) SWCNTs along
the tube axis by PL imaging spectroscopy. The chirality, diameter,
and length were perfectly characterized by PL and Raman spectroscopies.
Moreover, we derived the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity
for 350–1000 K by solving the heat equation. The temperature
dependence can be formulated by the combination of 3- and higher order
phonon scattering processes, and the 3-phonon scattering is dominant
in the present temperature range.
