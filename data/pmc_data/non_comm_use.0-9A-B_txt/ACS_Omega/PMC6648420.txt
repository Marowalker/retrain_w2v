Hot-carrier photodetectors
are drawing significant attention; nevertheless,
current researches focus mostly on the hot-electron devices, which
normally show low quantum efficiencies. In contrast, hot-hole photodetectors
usually have lower barriers and can provide a wide spectral range
of photodetection and an improved photoconversion efficiency. Here,
we report a comparable study of the hot-electron and hot-hole photodetectors
from both underlying physics and optoelectronic performance perspectives.
Taking the typical Au/Si Schottky contact as an example, we find obvious
differences in the energy band diagram and the sequent hot-carrier
generation/transport/emission processes, leading to very distinguished
photodetection performances. Compared with hot electrons, hot holes
show higher density below the Fermi level, the longer mean free path
arising under the lower electron–electron and electron–phonon
scatterings, a lower barrier height, and a lighter effective mass
in Si, all of which lead to larger number of high-energy hot holes,
larger transport probability, higher emission efficiency, and higher
photoresponsivity. However, the low barrier height can cause poor
performances of hot-hole device in dark current density and detectivity.
The study elucidates the intrinsic physical differences and compares
the key performance parameters of the hot-hole and hot-electron photodetections,
with the objective of providing complete information for designing
hot-carrier devices.

Introduction
Recently, hot carriers
generated from the nonradiative decay of
surface plasmons have attracted increasing attention for wide applications
in photodetection,1−9 photovoltaics,10,11 photocatalysis,12,13 and surface imaging.14,15 In terms of photodetection, the
internal photoemission process based on hot carriers enables convenient
infrared photodetection, room-temperature and zero-bias operation,
and high tunabilities on the working wavelength, bandwidth, and polarization
dependence.1

Due to the advantages
of hot-carrier devices, increasing interest
is given to hot-carrier photodetectors, especially those based on
hot electrons.1−9,16−21 For example, Knight et al. successfully observed the hot-electron
photoelectric response in the near-infrared band using the surface
plasmon effect of Au nanoantenna arrays deposited on an n-type silicon
substrate.1 Sobhani et al. constructed
a periodic Au nanograting on n-type silicon substrate for hot-electron
photodetector, achieving a strong and narrowband absorption, where
the photoresponsivity and internal quantum efficiency are 0.6 mA/W
and 0.2% at zero bias,3 respectively. Li
et al. combined a metamaterial perfect absorber with hot-electron
photodetector in which the metal used to generate the hot electrons
can be thinner than the diffusion length of the hot electrons, resulting
in the enhanced photoresponsivity up to 3 mA/W at 1300 nm.5 Wen et al. proposed a disordered ultrathin Au-covered
n-type silicon nanohole (Au/SiNH) structure with an unbiased photoresponsivity
of 1.5–13 mA/W at the wavelength range of 1100–1500
nm.6 Apparently, the photoresponsivity
and quantum efficiency are still low, restricted by the severe thermalization
losses of hot electrons during the transport process, the relatively
high Schottky barriers, and the nonideal experimental fabrications.8 Besides, the higher Schottky barrier in the hot-electron
device also determines that the detection cutoff wavelength is limited
and hard to be extended to longer wavelengths. Considering that the
Schottky barriers (φSB) formed by noble metals (e.g.,
Au, Ag, Cu, and Al) and p-type silicon are normally lower than those
with n-type silicon, e.g., Au/p-Si is ∼0.32 eV and Au/n-Si
is ∼0.8 eV. Due to the low barrier height, the dark current
is large unless under the low-temperature operation; thus, the reports
concerning the hot-hole photodetections are very rare. However, hot-hole
device could have advantages in the other key performance parameters
including the responsivity (Res.) and the detection cutoff wavelength
(λcut-off).22−25 For example, the significantly
enhanced responsivity of 1 A/W can be obtained at the relatively low
biases of 275 mV in the hot-hole system of Au grating on p-Si substrate.25 Therefore, it is worth to study the hot-hole
devices, as well as make a thorough comparison of the hot-electron
and hot-hole photodetectors from both intrinsic physics and performance
perspectives.

In this study, we make a comparable study of the
hot-electron and
hot-hole photodetectors with addressing the energy band bending, hot-carrier
generation, transport, and emission processes based on the modified
phenomenon model of the realistic hot-carrier device based on the
Au/Si Schottky junction. Concerning the intrinsic physics, distinct
differences lie in the energy band bending, density of occupied states
below and above the Fermi level Ef, energy
losses via electron–electron and electron–phonon scatterings,
and carrier effective mass. Consequently, hot holes and hot electrons
show distinct barrier height, initial energy distribution, mean free
path (MFP), momentum distribution, and interfacial reflection. Considering
a realistic planar hot-carrier device based on the Au/Si Schottky
junction, it is found that the fraction of the high-energy hot holes
is larger than that of hot electrons in the hot-carrier generation,
hot holes have higher transport probability and injection efficiency
due to the larger MFP and the lower barrier height, leading to a higher
external quantum efficiency (EQE) of ∼2.84% (0.18% for hot-electron
device). Moreover, due to the effects of barrier height and effective
Richardson constant, the dark current density (detectivity) of hot-hole
device is higher (lower) than that of hot-electron counterpart. The
comparable study promotes the understanding of the physics and compares
the key performance differences of various hot-carrier devices, which
provides a guidance for the design of hot-carrier devices.

Physical
Process of Hot Carriers
The working processes of the hot-carrier
photodetectors include
the light-excitation of hot carriers in metal, the transport toward
the metal–semiconductor (M/S) interface, and the emission over
the Schottky barrier into semiconductors.26−29 The internal photoemission process
plays the key role of below-band-gap photodetection, since the Schottky
barrier height is normally lower than the band gap of semiconductor
(Eg);30,31 moreover,
the hot electrons and hot holes are emitted into various bands of
semiconductors driven by the bended energy band. Therefore, it is
of significance to comparably address the physics accounting for the
energy band, hot-carrier generation, transport, and emission processes
in hot-electron and hot-hole devices.

Energy Band Bending
Different semiconductors in contact
with metal cause distinguished energy band bendings and junction barriers.
For junction composed by metal and n-type semiconductor (hot-electron
case), φSB = W – χ
(Au/n-Si: 0.8 eV), whereas for that by metal and p-type semiconductor
(hot-hole case), φSB = Eg – (W – χ) (Au/p-Si: 0.32 eV),26 where W is the work function
of metal and χ is the electron affinity of the crystal semiconductor.
Due to the structural defects and the higher Schottky barrier [Au/n-type
(p-type) amorphous silicon: 1.2 (0.52) eV],32 the amorphous silicon is less used in hot carrier photodetection. Figure 1a shows the energy
band diagrams of typical hot-hole (left) and hot-electron (right)
devices, which show that the hot holes and hot electrons are emitted
into the valence band and conduction band of semiconductors, respectively.
Such a specific energy band plays a primary role in forming the initial
energy distributions of the respective hot carriers as well as the
forthcoming carrier transport behaviors.

without (with) the consideration of carrier reflection.

Hot-Carrier Generation
Electrons
in the low-energy
level of metal are raised to the higher by absorbing photon energy,
leaving behind holes, i.e., the hot electrons and hot holes, respectively.
However, the generated hot electrons and holes are not distributed
uniformly in the energy spectrum and has to be carefully addressed.
For the low-energy photons in the near-infrared band, the hot-carrier
energy distribution can be calculated by the simplified electron distribution
joint density of states: the product of the electron density of states
(EDOS) at the initial and the final electron energies.33,34 For the generation rate in the excitation process, the assumption
of an absorbed photon generates only one hot electron–hole
pair is reasonable for the low-energy photons and the resistive loss
arising from the finite carrier life time is also considered. With
the EDOS, incident photon energy (incident light of λ = 1200
nm), Fermi distribution function, Figure 1b shows the asymmetric initial energy distributions33−36 relative to Ef of hot holes (left) and
hot electrons (right). The detailed calculation can be found in Section 2 of the Supporting Information. The
shaded areas indicate the proportion of the hot carriers with energy
higher than φSB (for Au/p-Si: φSB = 0.32 eV; for Au/n-Si: φSB = 0.8 eV). Although
the number of the generated hot holes and hot electrons are the same,
the energy of hot holes with peaked D and the proportion
of hot holes with energy over φSB are larger than
those of hot electrons. This is because most electrons occupy the
states with energies below Ef, whereas
holes left after photoexcitation occupy preferentially high energy
levels relative to Ef, as shown in Figure 1b. The above analysis
implies that there are more hot holes that can overcome the barrier
for photocurrent detection.

Hot-Carrier Transport
In the hot-carrier
transport
process, only if hot-carrier lifetime is long enough or the MFP is
greater than the distance from the position of hot-carrier generation
to the M/S interface, hot carriers can arrive at the interface for
collection.37 Employing the calculation
method of MFP reported in ref (37), energy-dependent MFP is shown in Figure 1c, which indicates that the MFPs of hot holes
are larger (less) than that of hot electrons when hot-carrier excess
energy relative to the Fermi level (Ec = E – Ef) <(>)
∼ 1.2 eV due to the differences in the energy losses of electron–electron
and electron–phonon scatterings for electrons and holes in
Au. Typically, the MFP of hot holes (electrons) with excess energy
of φSB is ∼47 (22) nm, i.e., the hot holes
have a higher probability to reach Schottky interface than that of
hot electrons before been dissipated via thermalization. In the case
of metal nanoparticles (NPs), the effect of the MFP is ignorable for
the hot carriers generated at metal NPs/semiconductor interface. However,
for the hot carriers generated away from the nanoparticle surface,
they could undergo electron–electron and electron–phonon
scatterings and be thermalized before injecting into semiconductor.38,39

Hot-Carrier Emission
Only if the kinetic energy associated
with momentum normal component of hot carriers reaching the M/S interface
are greater than φSB that hot carriers can emit into
semiconductor and be collected as photocurrent for detection.26Figure 1d compares the emission efficiency of hot holes (left) and
hot electrons (right) reaching the M/S interface as a function of
hot-carrier energy without considering the interface carrier reflection
(ηw/o_ref). It is found that the emission efficiency
of hot holes is much larger than that of hot electrons due to the
lower barrier height of hot holes than that of hot electrons. With
considering the hot-carrier reflection,16 the efficiencies (ηw_ref) of hot holes and hot
electrons will both be reduced, since some hot carriers in the allowed
momentum space will be reflected back into the metal. Moreover, the
emission efficiency of hot holes is decreased in a more significant
way (compared to that of hot electrons) due to the special momentum
distribution and reflection determined by the different effective
masses of holes and electrons in Si. Despite the emission efficiency
of hot holes is still higher than that of hot electrons, e.g., for
hot holes and hot electrons with Ec =
1.5 eV, ηw_ref = 0.16 and 0.11, respectively, which
implies that more hot holes can be successfully injected into semiconductor
to cause the higher photocurrent and photoresponsivity.

The
above analysis indicates that the hot-electron and hot-hole photoconversion
devices indeed show fundamentally distinguished physics, which regulate
the operations of the devices. In the next section, we further propose
a realistic device to explore the differences in the optoelectronic
performances of hot-hole and hot-electron photodetectors.

Realistic
Hot-Electron and Hot-Hole Devices
For a more comprehensive
study on comparing the hot-electron and
hot-hole devices, we now investigate a realistic planar Tamm system,
which can be modulated to collect the energy by hot electrons or hot
holes.17−19 Recently, Tamm plasmon has been studied in the hot-carrier-based
photodetection19 and organic narrowband
near-infrared photodetectors.40 The system
is under planar Tamm configuration composed of three pairs of alternating
SiO2/Si under distributed Bragger reflector (DBR) design
on an Au layer (dAu = 200 nm), as shown
in Figure 2a. The refractive
index of Si (SiO2) is 3.52 (1.62) for the design of DBR
with the central wavelength of λDBR = 1057 nm. At
the Tamm plasmon resonance of λTamm = 1200 nm, the
electric field is highly confined near the Schottky interface and
decays exponentially toward the Au layer with a narrow reflection
dip and perfect absorption (inset of Figure 2b). The spatial distribution of the hot-carrier
generation rate (G) is shown in Figure 2b, which shows that most of
the hot carriers are generated in the region close to the Schottky
interface with δG = 12 nm (i.e.,
the distance at which the generation rate drops to 1/e of the maximum). The calculation of absorption efficiency (A) and detailed derivation of the hot-carrier generation
rate G(z, ω) can be found
in Section 1 of the Supporting Information.37 According to the physical process of hot-carrier
generation, a pair of hot electron and hole is generated upon absorbing
a photon, so the generation rate of hot electrons and hot holes are
identical in the device.

with the normalized
electric field at working wavelength. (b) Profile of the hot-carrier
generation rate along the z-axis with the optical
response inserted. Contour map of the hot-hole (left) and hot-electron
(right) transport probability (c) and the flux (d) of hot carriers
with energy E reaching the Schottky interface at
position z.

After photoexcitation, to better understand the difference
in hot-hole
and hot-electron transport processes, Figure 2c compares the spatial distributions of the
hot-hole (left) and hot-electron (right) transport probabilities, Ptrans(z, E),16,26,41 defined by eq S5.2 in the Supporting Information. Here,
the hot-carrier thermalization loss is described by the exponential
attenuation model, i.e., exp(−d/lMFP), which indicates that the thermalization loss is
determined by the transport distance (d) and MFP.
The exponential attenuation model can be employed in the system of
metal NPs or other complex metal nanostructures. Since the MFP of
hot holes is larger than that of hot electrons for Ec < ∼1.2 eV, hot holes have a higher probability
to reach the Schottky interface than hot electrons at the same position
of the device. Accordingly, Figure 2d shows that the flux Nint(z, E) [defined by eq S6.2 in the Supporting Information] of hot
holes with high energy greater than φSB is much larger
than that of hot electrons and the energy distribution of hot holes
accumulated at the Schottky interface is more uniform than that of
hot electrons, regulated by the specific initial energy distribution
and transport probability. Besides, from the hot-carrier overall transport
efficiency ηtrans defined by eq S7 in the Supporting Information, the efficiencies of hot
holes and hot electrons are 30.59 and 28.73%, respectively, showing
the advantage of hot holes in the hot-carrier transport process. For
metals with a short mean free path (i.e., Ni with lMFP ∼ 6 nm42), it is
not appropriate for the hot-carrier photoconversion.

Since the
diffusion distance and the momentum distribution of carriers
along various diffusion angles are different, the influences of the
diffusion angle θ on the transport and emission processes should
be considered with particularly addressing the differences between
hot-electron and hot-hole devices. Figure 3a compares the angular flux distributions
of hot holes (left) and hot electrons (right) reaching the interface.
It is found that most hot carriers are concentrated in a range with
small diffusion angles, since the propagation path is larger under
a large diffusion angle, leading to more hot carriers from thermalization.
Moreover, the angular distribution of hot holes is relatively uniform
compared to that of hot electrons, with a broader-band distribution
of the hot holes, due to differences in the initial energy distribution
and transport probability. The calculation process can be found in Section 2 of the Supporting Information.

accumulated at the Schottky interface (a) and the emission efficiency

and loss distribution in the hot-hole (top) and hot-electron (bottom)
devices.

Figure 3b plots
the emission efficiencies (ηemi) of hot holes (left)
and hot electrons (right) versus θ and E – Ef. Due to the lower barrier height of the hot-hole
system, the emission efficiency of the hot-hole device is much larger
than that of the hot-electron counterpart. In addition, considering
the requirement of the kinetic energy and momentum for hot-carrier
interfacial transfer, there exists a critical angle. Over the critical
angle, the hot carriers cannot transfer across the barrier into the
semiconductor, i.e., the emission efficiency is 0. From the greatly
differed effective masses of electrons and holes in Si and the barrier
heights of hot-electron and hot-hole junctions, it is reasonable that
the critical angles of hot holes are larger than that of hot electrons,
so more hot holes can cross over the barrier compared to that of hot
electrons. Taking Ec = 1.2 eV as an example,
the critical angle of hot holes is ∼48°, which is larger
than that (∼35°) of hot electrons.

Figure 3c shows
the emission efficiencies of hot holes (left) and hot electrons (right)
with the anisotropic momentum distribution at the interface. It is
clear that ηemi of the hot hole is further greater
than that of hot electrons. The detailed calculation can be found
in Section 3 of the Supporting Information.
The external quantum efficiency and the responsivity of the device
based on hot holes (hot electrons) are 2.84% (0.18%) and 27.49 mA/W
(1.72 mA/W), respectively. The huge difference is mainly arising from
the distinguished barrier heights of the two devices. Finally, it
is well known that hot carriers encounter various energy losses in
various processes. To further understand the differences in energy
losses between hot-hole and hot-electron devices in each process, Figure 3d compares various
contributions of the energy losses by examining the hot-carrier flux
at each stage. We find that (1) the optical reflection and resistive
dissipation in hot-hole and hot-electron devices are the same; (2)
from the larger MFP, the thermalization loss of hot-hole device is
less than that of hot-electron device; (3) the barrier loss in hot-electron
device is much severer than that in hot-hole device due to the higher
Schottky barrier height; and (4) the momentum loss in hot-hole device
is greater than that in hot-electron device due to different momentum
distributions. As a result, the collection efficiency of hot holes
is larger than that of hot electrons, leading to a higher responsivity
and EQE.

According to the above analysis, the hot-hole device
has advantages
in the responsivity and EQE due to the lower barrier height and larger
MFP. However, besides the responsivity and EQE, the dark current density
and detectivity are also the key performance parameters of photodetectors.
The dark current density under a weak bias can be obtained from the
thermionic emission theory23 1  where A** is the effective
Richardson constant (∼110 A/(cm2 K2)
for electrons in n-Si and ∼30 A/(cm2 K2) for holes in p-Si),43T is the room temperature (300 K), q is the elemental
charge, and kB is the Boltzmann constant.
Detectivity describes the ability of distinguishing weak light signals
from the noise and can be written as  if the shot noise from the dark current
dominates all noises. It is found that Jd and D* of the realistic device with Au/n-Si [p-Si]
are 3.56 × 10–7 A/cm2 and 5.095
× 109 cm Hz1/2/W (Jones) [11.32 A/cm2 and 1.444 × 107 cm Hz1/2/W (Jones)],
respectively. Due to negative exponential correlation between Jd and φSB, although the hot-hole
device has a φSB = 0.32 eV, which is only 2/5 of
that of the hot-electron device (0.8 eV), Jd is 8 orders of magnitude larger. Thus, although the Res. of hot-hole
device (27.49 mA/W) is 16 times greater than that of hot-electron
device (1.72 mA/W), D* by hot-hole strategies is
2 orders of magnitude smaller.

Here, we make a comprehensive
comparison of the responsivity, dark
current density, and detectivity between the studied hot-electron,
hot-hole, and other reported devices based on the same working principle
in Table 1.20−22,24,44,45 It is found that the Res., Jd, and D* of the proposed hot-electron
and hot-hole device are comparable to the reported values based on
the similar M/S junction. Indeed, the detectivity is lower compared
to that of the photodetector based on two-dimensional material.

The above study compares the
differences of the photodetector performance
at the fixed barrier height and the working wavelength. Since the
Schottky barrier can be modified by engineering the interface and
the resonant wavelength can be regulated by changing the structural
parameters, we further compare the performances under various barrier
heights and resonant wavelengths in the hot-hole and hot-electron
devices as shown in Figure 4a–e. It is well known that the sum of the barrier height
of the hot-electron and hot-hole devices is the band gap of the semiconductor;
therefore, with the φSB of Au/n-Si device being modified
from 0.8 to 0.5 eV, φSB of Au/p-Si device will be
changed accordingly from 0.32 to 0.62 eV.43 Due to the negative exponential correlation between Jd and φSB and the decreased proportion
of hot carriers with energy over φSB, Jd and Res. will be decreased with the increase of φSB (fixed λ), as shown in Figure 4a–c. Hence, in Figure 4d,e, D* exhibits a much
more complicated dependence on φSB; therefore, we
have to carefully design the hot-hole and hot-electron devices for
a larger D*. Similarly, since the absorption efficiency,
hot-carrier energy distribution, transport efficiency, and injection
efficiency change with incident photon energy, with the increase of
the resonant wavelength (fixed φSB), the generated
hot carriers with energy over φSB and the emission
efficiency in the interfacial transfer process are decreased, leading
to the decreased Res. and D*. Especially, when the
resonant wavelength is greater than the cutoff wavelength, Res. and D* are both reduced to 0, i.e., the device fails to work.
Particularly, the cutoff wavelength λcut-off (3.875 μm) of the hot-hole device with φSB of 0.32 eV is much longer than that (1.55 μm) of the hot-electron
device with φSB of 0.8 eV due to the lower barrier
height, showing the advantage/ability of the hot-hole device in long-wavelength
photodetection. Considering the same Schottky barrier height in the
range of 0.5–0.62 eV, due to different the momentum loss in
the interfacial carrier transport process and the effective Richardson
constant, the Res. and Jd of the hot-electron
device are larger than those of the hot-hole device. As a result, D* of the hot-electron device is less than that of the hot-hole
device, showing the benefit of the collection of hot holes.

Conclusions
In summary, based on
the modified classical phenomenon model, we
make a detailed comparison of the energy band bending, initial energy
distribution, transport probability, and interfacial emission efficiency
in the hot-hole and hot-electron generation, transport, and emission
processes. The foremost physical differences and consequent effects
are summarized detail in Table 2. In total, the hot-hole devices with lower barrier heights
have advantages in responsivity and long-wavelength detection, whereas
the hot-electron systems with higher barrier heights have advantages
in dark current density and detection. The comparable study of the
hot-hole and hot-electron systems presents the detailed devices physics
as well as elucidates the performance differences for an optimal design
of hot-carrier photodetectors.
