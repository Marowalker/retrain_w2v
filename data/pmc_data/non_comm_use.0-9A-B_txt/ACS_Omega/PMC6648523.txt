Despite
promising benefits, anti-angiogenic strategies
have revealed several drawbacks, which necessitate development of
novel approaches in cancer therapy strategies including non-small-cell
lung cancer, as one of the leading causes of cancer death, all over
the world. Combination of flavonoids could be a safe and effective
option to synergize their impact on mechanisms controlling tumor angiogenesis.
In this study, we have investigated the plausible synergism of epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG) and silibinin on endothelial cells, for the first time. Cell
viability and migration were evaluated by survival and wound healing
assays, respectively. Then, we assessed the expression of VEGF, VEGFR2, and miR-17–92 cluster
using real-time polymerase chain reaction in endothelial–tumor cell and
endothelial–fibroblast coculture models. EGCG ± silibinin
suppressed endothelial and lung tumor cell migration in lower than
50% toxic doses. VEGF, VEGFR2, and
pro-angiogenic members of the miR-17–92 cluster were downregulated
upon treatments. Specifically, the combination treatment upregulated
an anti-angiogenic member of the cluster, miR-19b. Our data provides
evidence to utilize the EGCG and silibinin combination as a novel
approach to target tumor angiogenesis in the future.

==== Body
Introduction
Since its first suggestion
in 1971, anti-angiogenic therapy of
cancer has been known as an essential approach in treating many types
of the disease.1 In non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), like other solid tumors, angiogenesis is accompanied
with highly invasive and metastatic properties of disease. Treating
approaches including anti-angiogenic agents are among the promising
therapies in clinical trials. However, there is a critical need for
more studies in this area to overcome observed toxicities and drawbacks.2 Angiogenesis, the process of creating new blood
vessels from preexisting ones, is a key physiological and developmental
event to maintain homeostasis. Disrupted regulation of angiogenesis
is directly linked to different pathologies and life-threatening diseases,
particularly cancer.3 Regardless of the
angiogenesis-inducing source, endothelial cell functions such as survival
and migration are crucial in angiogenesis. Endothelial cell survival
and migration directly depend on vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)-mediated pathways, the key target in most available anti-angiogenic
therapeutic options.4 On targeting this
growth factor, its receptors or downstream mediators, by current approaches,
not only inhibit tumor angiogenesis but also cause a systemic endothelial
cell dysfunction and subsequent toxicity and cardiovascular diseases.5 In addition, resistance to VEGF-targeted therapies
has been reported in clinical settings.6 Therefore, development of novel and safe strategies is an unmet
health priority to minimize the side effects of anti-angiogenic therapeutics.

Tumor microenvironment is a mixture of different factors, secreted
from cancer and stromal cells in response to detrimentally imposed
conditions.7 The angiogenic response is
a consequence of the interplay among several angiogenesis inducers
and inhibitors, secreted by the cells in a tumor microenvironment.
However, targeting a single molecular pathway in a specific cell type
would not suffice the treatment goals.4b,8 Thus, finding
new treatment options targeting multiple target(s) that effectively
inhibit the pathological angiogenesis with minimal disruption of physiological
angiogenesis is a crucial need.7b,9

MicroRNA (miRNA)s
are a class small non-coding RNAs that negatively
regulate their downstream target genes either by degrading the mRNA
or inhibiting its translation to the protein.10 MiRNAs play diverse roles in endothelial cell integrity and functions.
Importantly, they control angiogenesis by regulation of target genes
involved in endothelial cell migration and survival.11 Several lines of evidence indicate contribution of the
highly expressed polycistronic miR-17–92 cluster to angiogenic
properties and tumor development.12 Furthermore,
it has been shown that the miR-17–92 cluster regulates the
endothelial cell function and angiogenic switch upon VEGF induction.13 This suggests the miR-17–92 cluster to
be a potential target in treating malignancies through affecting both
tumor and endothelial cells.

A compelling body of evidence support
the notion that flavonoids
could be considered as promising treatment options to combat cancer.
Particularly, in the context of angiogenesis, pleiotropic activity
of these phytochemicals via targeting multiple molecular pathways
in either tumor or endothelial cells interferes with tumor development
and angiogenesis. Combinatorial application of different flavonoids
is plausible to strengthen their anti-angiogenic capacity.14 Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)15 and silibinin16 are
the major flavonoid-type active constituents of two of the most consumed
plant products, green tea and milk thistle (Silybum
marianum), modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis
induction, the anti-angiogenic and anticancer effects of which have
been reported in a variety of tumors (Figure 1A).14,17

Figure 1 Structural properties
and the effect of epigallocatechin-gallate
(EGCG, C22H18O11) and silibinin (C25H22O10) on cell viability. (A) Structural
properties of EGCG and silibinin. Relative cell viability of the human
umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) (B), A549 (C), and human dermal
fibroblasts (HDFs) (D) was evaluated in response to EGCG (25, 50,
and 75 μgr/mL), silibinin (25, 50, and 75 μM), and combinations
(25 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin, 50 μg/mL EGCG
+ 50 μM silibinin, 25 μg/mL EGCG + 75 μM silibinin,
50 μg/mL EGCG + 75 μM silibinin) compared with control,
in 24 h. Values represent mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM)
of at least three replicates. (Dissimilar letters indicate significant
difference with max P < 0.05.)

In this study, we have investigated the impact
of combining these
flavonoids on cell viability and migration of human umbilical vein
endothelial cell (HUVEC) and A549, an epithelial carcinoma cell line,
which is a common model for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) studies.
Moreover, we have evaluated the differential effect of single versus
combined treatments of EGCG and silibinin on gene expression changes
of VEGF and VEGFR2 and their downstream miR-17–92
cluster to find out the potential mechanism underlying the pleiotropic
activity of these secondary metabolites. We have focused on the potential
additive anti-angiogenic effect of EGCG and silibinin considering
the ease of access and extensive consumption worldwide.18 More importantly, EGCG15b and silibinin19 have been previously
reported to play anti-angiogenic roles individually. However, the
synergistic effect of EGCG and silibinin co-treatment on endothelial
cell mechanisms underlying angiogenesis has remained to be addressed.

Results
and Discussion
EGCG and Silibinin Treatment Regulates Viability
in Endothelial
and Lung Tumor Cells and Fibroblasts
Previous studies have reported
the inhibitory effect of EGCG and silibinin on cell viability of multiple
cells.16b,20 However, the potential synergistic effect
of EGCG and silibinin treatment on cell viability has remained to
be addressed. Our findings indicate that EGCG (25–75 μg/mL)
is able to significantly inhibit the viability of HUVEC in 24 h not exceeding 50% of the
control group; >60% viability was observed in response to 50 μg/mL
(Figure 1B). These
results are consistent with previous studies indicating a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability in response to EGCG. In the context of
EGCG, regulation of Wnt and Id signaling pathways has been suggested
as the anti-proliferative mechanism of action in HUVEC.20b Wnt signaling is involved in angiogenesis through
regulation of cell proliferation, survival, migration, differentiation,
and apoptosis.21 Regulation of key angiogenesis
genes such as VEGF has been shown as a target of
Wnt signaling,22 which could be considered
in our future investigations. Other studies have reported no significant
change in HUVEC viability 24 h after treatment with EGCG (50 μM,
∼23 μg/mL), which are analogous to our data at 25 μg/mL.23

We observed a decreasing but not significant
trend in cell viability of HUVEC in response to silibinin treatments
(25–75 μM). As previously shown, this reduction could
be relevant to a pleiotropic activity of silibinin on endothelial
cells. Increase in Cip1/p21, Kip1/p27, and p53 and subsequent cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis induction through upregulating BAX and
downregulating Mcl1, on one hand, and suppressing Akt and necrosis
factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling, on the other hand, are the
plausible pathways that are implicated in silibinin effect on endothelial cells.16a The converging result of P53 induction24 and reduction of Akt25 and NF-κB26 is downregulation of
VEGF, which can be proposed as the downstream mechanism of silibinin
action on endothelial cells. Vakili Zahir et al. have reported a higher
tolerance of HUVEC to silibinin treatment compared with the HepG2
(human hepatocellular liver carcinoma) cell line, though treatment
with a high level of silibinin leads to a necrotic cell death in HUVEC.27 This indicates that different tumor cell lines,
liver versus lung, may differently respond to silibinin.

Interestingly,
our results revealed that the combination of EGCG
and silibinin at the same concentrations led to no significant reduction
of cell viability of HUVEC in comparison with single treatments at
equal time point (Figure 1B), and cell viability of HUVEC following the EGCG (50 μg/mL)
and silibinin (50 μM) combination treatment was nearby 70%.
The importance of this finding is that co-treatment of these two flavonoids
enhanced cytotoxicity in lung tumor cells compared with single treatments
(Figure 1C).

As shown in Figure 1C, viability of the malignant lung tumor cell line, A549, was not
significantly influenced upon 24 h treatment with EGCG (25 and 50
μg/mL) or silibinin (25, 50, and 75 μM). In contrast,
the combination of EGCG (50 μg/mL) and silibinin (50 and 75
μM) significantly reduced A549 cell viability, not exceeding
60% of the control group.

A growing number of studies have shown
the apoptosis induction
and inhibitory activities of EGCG on the growth and development of
cancer cells including head and neck,28 breast,29 colorectal,30 prostate,31 hepatocellular carcinoma,32 Kaposi’s sarcoma,33 and lung cancer cells.20a Importantly,
it has been shown that A549 cells are extremely resistant to EGCG
treatment in vitro.34 However,
high concentrations of EGCG are capable of inducing apoptosis in these
cells.35 Similarly, there are plenty of
studies indicating the suppressive effect of silibinin on hepatocellular
carcinoma,36 prostate,37 breast,38 neuroblastoma,39 colorectal,40 and
lung16b cancer cells. Silibinin treatment
interferes with cell growth prominently through G1 arrest16b and apoptotic induction41 in NSCLC. Our results showed no significant change in cell
viability of A549, as a NSCLC model, upon EGCG or silibinin single
treatment at lower doses, which was reverted by increasing the concentration
(Figure S1). The significant increase in
toxicity against A549 cells through co-treatment with both components
is suggestive of a direct tumor-killing activity, whose precise underlying
mechanism needs to be unfolded.

In parallel, we have evaluated
the fibroblast response to relevant
concentrations of EGCG or silibinin. Proliferation of fibroblasts
is important in wound healing as an example of physiological angiogenesis.
They contribute to new vessel formation and integrity by secreting
extracellular matrix components.42 We showed
that 24 h treatment with EGCG (25 and 50 μg/mL) or silibinin
(25, 50, and 75 μM) did not significantly affect the viability
of normal fibroblast in comparison with the control group (Figure 1D). However, treatment
with mixed concentrations of EGCG (50 μg/mL) and silibinin (50
and 75 μM) revealed a significant decrease in cell viability
not exceeding 50%; HDFs revealed higher than 70% viability following
treatment with EGCG (50 μg/mL) and silibinin (50 μM).
Our results suggest that normal fibroblasts are resistant to EGCG
or silibinin; however, combination treatment moderates their viability
not more than 50% of untreated cells. It is consistent with the previously
reported noncytotoxic effect of EGCG or silibinin on normal fibroblasts.43

As determined by our half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) measurements, HUVEC was the most sensitive
cell to EGCG
or silibinin treatment (Table 1). In fact, IC50 values of both components were
significantly lower in HUVEC than those in A549 and normal fibroblasts
in 24 h. Collectively, EGCG and silibinin induced a dose-dependent
decrease in cell viability, which was further confirmed at higher
concentrations (Figure S1, Supporting Information).

Silibinin in HUVEC, A549, and HDF Cells

Endothelial and Lung Tumor Cell Migration Is Markedly Reduced
upon EGCG and Silibinin Treatment
Cell migration is a key
process not only in angiogenesis but also in tumor metastasis. It
is a process by which endothelial cells undergo massive angiogenesis
under not only physiological but also pathological conditions, e.g.,
tumor growth.44 We conducted the wound
healing assay to investigate the potential inhibitory effect of the
EGCG and silibinin combination on endothelial and tumor cell migration
in concentrations at which beyond 50% cell viability was observed
because high toxicity would contradict with the foundation of cell
migration estimation. Our results approved the previous reports on
the inhibitory effect of EGCG23a or silibinin16a on HUVEC migration. Enumerating migrated cells
to the wound area using imageJ revealed that migration of HUVEC is
significantly suppressed in response to noncytotoxic doses of EGCG
or silibinin in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, we found that
the antimigratory effect of EGCG or silibinin significantly elevated
upon combination treatment of these flavonoids in HUVEC, demonstrating
a remarkable synergistic effect of EGCG and silibinin on HUVEC migration
(Figure 2).

Figure 2 EGCG and silibinin
inhibit HUVEC migration. (A) Cell migration
effects of EGCG (25 and 50 μg/mL), silibinin (50 and 75 μM),
and their combination (25 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin,
50 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin, 25 μg/mL EGCG +
75 μM silibinin, 50 μg/mL EGCG + 75 μM silibinin)
in 24 h on HUVEC cells. (B) Representative indication of cell migration
response of HUVEC to EGCG, silibinin, and their combination. Number
of cells within four randomly chosen wound regions were measured using
ImageJ and were normalized to the control group (scale bar: 100 μm).
Dissimilar Letters indicate significant difference, with max P < 0.05, using statistical analysis by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA), and values represent mean ± SEM.

Wang et al. have shown that the EGCG-induced antimigratory
effect
on HUVEC is mediated by suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-NF-κB
axis.23b A downstream mechanism of suppressing
NF-κB in cell migration is reduction in the VEGF expression as a regulatory target for EGCG and silibinin treatment
in our study.

Migration is a critical step in cancer cell invasion
and metastasis.45 In the context of lung
tumor cells, EGCG46 or silibinin47 is
capable of inhibiting cell migration. Similar to HUVEC, treatment
with EGCG or silibinin alone inhibited migration of A549 tumor cells
compared to the control untreated group. As a novel finding, we report
for the first time that the combination of EGCG and silibinin is more
potent to attenuate migration of A549 cells, as a typical NSCLC model,
compared to either EGCG or silibinin alone. We observed that the combination
of EGCG (25 and 50 μg/mL) and silibinin (50 and 75 μM)
significantly declined migration of A549 tumor cells compared with
the treatment with corresponding concentrations of each flavonoid
(Figure 3). It should
be noted that co-treatment with EGCG (50 μg/mL) and silibinin
(50 μM) led to the highest inhibitory effect on A549 cell migration
compared to that of other concentrations examined. Therefore, these
doses were utilized in our mechanistic gene expression studies.

Figure 3 EGCG and silibinin
inhibit A549 cell migration. (A) Cell migration
effects of silibinin (25, 50, and 75 mM), EGCG (25 and 50 mg/mL),
and their combination (25 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin,
50 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin, 25 μg/mL EGCG +
75 μM silibinin, 50 μg/mL EGCG + 75 μM silibinin)
in 24 h on HUVEC cells. (B) Representative indication of cell migration
response of A549 to EGCG, silibinin, and their combination. The number
of cells within four randomly chosen wound regions were measured using
ImageJ and were normalized to the control (scale bar: 100 μm).
Dissimilar Letters indicate significant difference, with max P < 0.05, using statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA,
and values represent mean ± SEM.

Altogether, our wound healing data suggest that the combinatorial
treatment of EGCG and silibinin exerts a synergistic effect on inhibition
of migration both in tumor and endothelial cells. While 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) results indicated cell viability around 70% in HUVEC
and higher than 80% in A549, following EGCG (50 μg/mL) and silibinin
(50 μM) combination administration, the antimigratory capacity
of equal treatment was greater than 80% of the control group in both
cell lines.

Inhibitory Effect of EGCG and Silibinin Treatment
on Endothelial
Cell Migration and Viability Is Mediated via Downregulation of VEGF–VEGFR2
Axis
Next, we aimed to determine the mechanisms underlying
regulation of cell viability and migration by EGCG and silibinin.
It has been previously shown that the VEGF pathway is the key component
of angiogenesis in various contexts.3 VEGF
is the master mediator in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis.48 VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling critically regulates
endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration, and tube formation.49 The VEGF pathway has emerged as a specific target
to minimize elevated angiogenesis in various types of cancer.50 It has been reported that green tea extract
is capable of diminishing the expression of VEGF and
its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.51 Deep et al. have shown the downregulation of VEGF and VEGFR2 in HUVEC following treatment
with milk thistle-derived flavonolignans including silybin A, silybin
B, isosilybin A, and isosilybin B.20c To
our knowledge, there is no study on the specific effect of EGCG or
silibinin on the VEGF axis in endothelial cells, so far. In this study,
we have investigated the impact of EGCG, silibinin, and their combination
on the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 in HUVEC. The novelty of our study is evaluation of gene expression
changes provoked by EGCG and silibinin in HUVEC in the presence of
A549 tumor cells as robust inducers of angiogenesis. The angiogenic
function of endothelial cells is influenced by tumor cells or fibroblasts.
Therefore, we examined whether the effect of EGCG and silibinin on
endothelial cells is mediated by altering the function of these cells
or not. First, HUVECs were cocultured with A549 tumor cells and then
treated with EGCG, silibinin, or their combination for 24 h (Figure 4A). Gene expression
analysis in isolated HUVEC demonstrated that EGCG, silibinin, and
their combination dramatically downregulated VEGF (Figure 4B) and VEGFR2 (Figure 4C) as master mediators of angiogenesis. We further showed
that VEGF expression is significantly lowered in
HUVEC cocultured with primary human fibroblast obtained from healthy
individuals, in response to EGCG, silibinin, or their combination
(Figure 4D,E). EGCG
treatment was not able to significantly reduce VEGFR2 expression in HUVEC upon coculture with normal fibroblast. In contrary,
silibinin reduced VEGFR2 expression, which was reversed
after co-treatment with EGCG (Figure 4E).

Figure 4 Gene expression changes of VEGF and VEGFR2 in HUVEC cells cocultured with A549 or HDF. Representative
of HUVEC
cocultured differentially with A549 (A) or HDF (D). RNA extraction
was performed from HUVEC after 24 h of treatment with EGCG (50 μg/mL),
silibinin (50 μM), or the combination (50 μg/mL EGCG +
50 μM silibinin). VEGF (B) or VEGFR2 (C) expression in HUVEC cocultured with A549. VEGF (E) or VEGFR2 (F) expression in HUVEC cocultured
with HDF. Gene expression changes were normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Values represent mean ±
SEM of at least two replicates. (Dissimilar letters indicate significant
difference with max P < 0.05.)

These data are suggestive of an EGCG ± silibinin-induced VEGF–VEGFR2 signaling in endothelial
cells cocultured with tumor cells. However, the nonsignificant effect
of the EGCG and silibinin combination on endothelial cells cocultured
with normal fibroblasts indicates a selective beneficial impact of
this treatment under healthy conditions, which should be mechanistically
unfolded in the future.

Expression of miR-17–92 Cluster Is
Tightly Regulated
by EGCG and Silibinin Treatment
To decipher the consequence
of diminished expression of VEGF, we evaluated endothelial
changes of miR-17–92 expression in the presence of tumor cells.
It has been reported that VEGF induces the expression of the polycistronic
miR-17–92 cluster, which is critically involved in endothelial
cell function, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis via regulation of
VEGF–VEGFR2 expression.13 The polycystronic
miR-17–92 cluster encodes six miRNAs, namely, miR-17, miR-18a,
miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, and miR-92a, which are crucially implicated
in tumor angiogenesis. Upregulation of the miR-17–92 cluster
leads to increased angiogenic and invasive properties of the tumor
cells.12 MiR-17–92 is highly expressed
in endothelial cells, and it has been revealed that each member acts
differentially on angiogenesis.52 For instance,
miR-18a and miR-20a53 promote angiogenesis
in contrary to miR-19b54 and miR-92a55 that induce anti-angiogenic features. To our
knowledge, the regulatory role of EGCG and silibinin in regulation
of miR-17–92 expression has not been investigated before. Thus,
we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
to evaluate gene expression changes of the miR-17–92 cluster
in HUVEC following treatment with EGCG, silibinin, or their combination
cocultured with A549 cells or normal fibroblast.

Gene expression
analysis indicated that EGCG, silibinin, and their combination significantly
down-regulate miR-18a (Figure 5B), miR-20a (Figure 5D), and miR-92a (Figure 5E) in HUVEC cocultured with A549 cells. Concomitantly,
silibinin downregulated miR-17 expression in HUVEC either in single
treatment or in combination with EGCG. However, EGCG alone did not
alter miR-17 in the same conditions (Figure 5A). On the other hand, miR-19b, as an anti-angiogenic
factor, was significantly upregulated specifically after EGCG + silibinin
co-treatment in HUVEC. Nevertheless, miR-19b did not significantly
change upon EGCG or silibinin treatment compared to the control group
(Figure 5C). Interestingly,
the combination of EGCG and silibinin did not significantly change
the expression of miR-17–92 cluster when HUVEC was cocultured
with normal fibroblasts obtained from healthy subjects (data not shown).

Figure 5 Effects
of silibinin, EGCG, and their combination on the miRNA
expression level of the miR-17–92 family in HUVECs cocultured
with A549. Gene expression changes of miR-17 (A), miR-18a (B), miR-19b
(C), miR-20a (D), and miR-92a (E) of HUVECs cocultured with A549 in
response to EGCG (50 μg/mL), silibinin (50 μM), or the
combination (50 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin) were normalized
to U6. Values represent mean ± SEM of at least two replicates.
(Dissimilar letters indicate significant difference with max P < 0.05.)

Our data suggest that the expression of pro-angiogenic miRNAs
in
endothelial cells elevated in the presence of tumor cells could be
modulated upon EGCG, silibinin, or combination treatment. More interestingly,
the combination of silibinin and EGCG treatment in endothelial cells
is required to provoke a miRNA-mediated anti-angiogenic response,
which was abolished by tumor cells.

Differential impact of these
compounds on pro- versus anti-angiogenic
miRNAs along with their suppressive effect on the VEGF–VEGFR2
axis provides mechanistic evidence to support the notion that the
combination of EGCG and silibinin could effectively minimize angiogenesis
in solid tumors. Nevertheless, extensive in vivo pharmacokinetic and
mechanistic studies on animal models of cancer will determine the
potential future application of this combinatorial therapy in clinical
settings. In addition, in silico modeling investigations will further
reveal the mode of interaction between EGCG and silibinin and specific
molecular targets on endothelial cells.

Conclusions
Targeting
multiple pathways of tumor angiogenesis along with minimal
side effects on normal tissues is a demanding factor in the development
of anticancer therapeutic strategies. A variety of flavonoids exhibit
anti-angiogenic effects by targeting a wide range of molecular targets
in both tumor and endothelial cells.9 Herein,
we have addressed the inhibitory effect of the EGCG and silibinin
combination on endothelial cell migration, survival, VEGF–VEGFR2, and miR-17–92 expression,
as essential events in angiogenesis. Altogether, our results suggest
that the EGCG and silibinin combination may not only beneficially
modulate endothelial cell functions but also directly target tumor
cells. It could further the anti-angiogenic antitumor properties by
widening the target cells, which deserves detailed investigations
in the future.

Anti-angiogenic therapy has extensive benefits,
which is based
on the critical reliance of solid tumors on neoangiogenesis.7b,56 However, there are a number of challenges in front that encourage
researchers to develop more efficient and less toxic approaches.6 High distribution of flavonoids in fruits and
vegetables and widespread consumption of plant products containing
a variety of flavonoids as food or beverage all over the world, in
parallel with growing evidence of their antioxidant and anticancer
capacity, have made them promising alternatives for anti-angiogenic
therapies.57

In addition, a variety
of in vivo studies and human clinical trials
on whether oral administration or intravenous injection of some flavonoids
introduces an inconsistency with in vitro results which specify a severe concern about the nonsoluble flavonoids in
water and the stability of these compounds in physiological conditions.57,58 This would affect not only the bioavailability of the flavonoid
but also degradation by enzymatic reactions, starting from mixing
with saliva, and is capable of forming pro-oxidant molecules with
possible side effects.59 As an example,
in the case of EGCG, the peak plasma level of orally administered
flavonoid is in sub-micromolar range,60 which is very low compare to approved active concentrations in an
in vitro situation. To enhance the exploitation of the compound, there
are some solutions, among which increasing the intestinal absorption
by a nano-drug delivery system using polymeric micelles has been reported
to exhibit a variety of benefits.61 Sustained
drug release, increased drug load, enhanced tumor accumulation, and
high stability61,62 are among the welfares of using
the polymeric micelle approach, and improved efficacy has been reported for
a number of flavonoids including EGCG63 and quercetin.62 Low solubility of silibinin
in water, however, can be overcome by increasing the administered
doses because highly tolerable characteristics of its consumption have been approved in a variety
of in vivo and clinical studies. Cumulative uptake amount of this
flavonoid in parallel with introducing the novel silibinin formulation
can intensify bioavailability and plasma absorption.19 However, it is beneficial to be cautious about using silibinin
in combination with other drugs. In a clinical study of using oral
administration of a commercial formula of silibinin, silybin-phytosome,
in prostate cancer patients, an improvement in the bioavailability
and plasma absorbance of silibinin was observed; however, variability
in inter- or intrapatient responses emphasizes the impact of complexity
of physiological conditions on its functionality and necessitates
wide and detailed preclinical studies prior to using flavonoids in
clinical conditions. Altogether, these are suggestive of evaluating
promising drug delivery approaches for future studies on EGCG + silibinin
in in vivo and further clinical trials.

Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell
(obtained from the Medical Biology Research Center of Kermanshah University
of Medical Sciences) and the A549 cell line (ATCC CCL-185) (obtained
from the Pasture Institute of Iran) were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Bioidea) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 μg/mL) (Bioidea) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C
and 5% CO2.

Human Dermal Fibroblast Isolation
Human dermal fibroblasts
(HDFs) were isolated from the obtained foreskin tissue samples of
children (age range between 10 days and 2 months) immediately after
circumcision by modifying and setting up the method reported by Nejaddehbashi
et al.64 Briefly, tissue samples obtained
from a private clinic were transferred to the laboratory on ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing penicillin (200 U/mL),
streptomycin (200 μg/mL), and 0.3% amphotericin B. After sterilizing
the samples with 70% ethanol and washing with PBS (200 U/mL penicillin,
200 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.3% amphotericin B) three to five
times, the hypodermis layer and related blood vessels were removed
from the tissues. Samples were cut into 1 cm pieces and incubated
in 0.25% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Bioidea)
at 4 °C overnight. After incubation, the epidermis was set apart
from the dermis, the dermis was chapped into very small pieces, and
collagenase IV (1 mg/mL) was allowed to the tissue pieces for 1 h
in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity,
shaking every 5 min. After neutralizing with an FBS-containing medium,
the suspension was centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant
was cultivated in cell culture flasks with 20% FBS.

Treatment Preparation
EGCG (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS number:
989-51-5, purity (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) area
%): 94%) and silibinin (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS number: 22888-70-6, purity
(HPLC area %): 99.1%) were obtained from Sigma. EGCG and silibinin
high-concentration stock solutions were prepared by dissolving the
compounds in appropriate solvents, water for EGCG and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) for silibinin. Treatment solutions were prepared freshly just
before the experiment by diluting the appropriate amount of stock
solutions in 1% FBS-containing medium. The final concentration of
DMSO did not exceed 0.1% in culture medium.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability in response to
different treatments was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate
(0.5 × 104 cells/well) and treated with different
concentrations of EGCG, silibinin, or their combination in DMEM containing
1% FBS. After 24 h, cell viability was compared with the control group
using the MTT assay (Autocell) at 570 nm with the reference wavelength
of 630 nm.

Wound Healing Assay
The migration
capacity of different
cells was evaluated via the wound healing assay. Briefly, cells were
grown in 24-well plates at high density in DMEM containing 10% FBS
and abovementioned antibiotics. Next day, a scratch was created across
the confluent cell layer using a tip. After gently removing the old
medium and detached cells, fresh medium supplemented with 2% FBS and
different concentrations of treatments including EGCG (25 and 50 μg/mL),
silibinin (50 and 75 μM), and their combination (25 μg/mL
EGCG + 50 μM silibinin, 50 μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin,
25 μg/mL EGCG + 75 μM silibinin, 50 μg/mL EGCG +
75 μM silibinin) was added to each well. After 24 h incubation
at 37 °C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2, the number of
migrated cells was calculated in each treatment in four randomly chosen
microscopic fields and compared with the nontreated control using
ImageJ software.

Cell Coculture in Transwell Plates
Transwell plates
(Corning, Cat# 3493) were used to evaluate the effect of different
treatments on gene expression changes. After seeding and attachment
of HUVECs in lower chambers, A549 cells were cultured in upper chambers
of 12-well transwell plates and supplemented with DMEM, 10% FBS, and
antibiotics. Coculture cells were treated with freshly prepared EGCG
(50 μg/mL), silibinin (50 μM), or their combination (50
μg/mL EGCG + 50 μM silibinin) in 2% FBS for 24 h. The
experiments were performed in triplicate and in two independent repeats.

RNA Extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA of cocultured cells
was extracted using RNX-plus (CinnaGen, Iran) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The yield and purity of the extracted RNAs were assessed
by 2% agarose gel and NanoDrop 1000 (Termo Scientific), and complementary
DNAs were synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara
Bio, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Quantitative
Real-Time PCR
Gene expression changes
of VEGF, VEGFR1, and VEGFR2 were evaluated in cocultured HUVECs after different treatments
using an Applied Biosystem StepOne instrument (Applied Biosystem)
and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Bio, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR conditions were as follows: 95
°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and
60 °C for 30 s. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the endogenous control to normalize changes
of target genes through the 2–ΔΔCt method. All samples were duplicated and repeated
at least in two different biological repeats. Primer sequences are
mentioned in Table 2.

Statistical Analysis
All data were
obtained from at
least two independent experiments and expressed as the mean ±
SEM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey post-hoc
test was used to determine the effectiveness of different treatments
compared with the control group. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc
analysis was utilized in assessment of the difference between treatment
groups. The P-value less than 0.05 was considered
as statistically significant.
