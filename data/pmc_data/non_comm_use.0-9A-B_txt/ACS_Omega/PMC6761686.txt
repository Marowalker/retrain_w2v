Over
the past 30 years, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of
infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria, which have proliferated
due to the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Over this same time
period, however, there has also been a decline in the number of antibiotics
with novel mechanisms of action coming to market. Therefore, there
is a growing need for an increase in the speed at which new antibiotics
are discovered and developed. Natural products produced by bacteria
have been and continue to be a robust source of novel antibiotics;
however, new and complementary methods for screening large bacterial
libraries for novel antibiotic production are needed due to the current
agar methods being limited in scope, time consuming, and prone to
error. Herein, we describe a rapid, robust, and quantitative high-throughput
liquid culture screening method for antibiotic production by bacteria.
This method has the ability to screen both mono- and coculture mixtures
of bacteria in vitro and be adapted to other phenotypic
natural product analyses. Over 260 bacterial species were screened
in monoculture, and 38 and 34% were found to produce antibiotics capable
of inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli, respectively,
with 8 and 4% being classified as strong producers (≥30% growth
inhibition), respectively. Bacteria found to not produce antibiotics
in monoculture were also screened in coculture using an adaptation
of this method. Of the more than 270 cocultures screened, 14 and 30%
were found to produce antibiotics capable of inhibition of S. aureus or E. coli, respectively. Of those bacteria found to produce antibiotics in
monoculture, 43 bacteria were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and
found to be majority Pseudomonas (37%), Serratia (19%), and Bacillus (14%) bacteria, but two novel
producers, Herbaspirillum and Kluyvera, were also found.

Introduction
Multidrug-resistant
bacterial infections are one of the top three threats to global public
health and are projected to cause up to 10 million deaths worldwide
by the year 2050 if the current trend continues.1,2 There
are many factors that contribute to the upsurge of multidrug-resistant
bacterial infections with the largest being the overuse and misuse
of antibiotics both in medicine, as they are among the most commonly
prescribed drugs, and in agriculture.3,4 Resistance
to a particular antibiotic can occur rapidly and broadly, where bacteria
can become resistant to an entire class of drugs with the same mechanism
of action. Therefore, there is a dire need for the constant development
and production of novel and efficacious antibiotics to keep pace with
the ever-evolving bacteria. Natural products, which have been fine-tuned
by nature to elicit a specific biological activity, continue to be
an excellent source of novel molecules that can be used as blueprints
for antibacterial drug design; however, many challenges with natural
product isolation and characterization remain.

Between 1981
and 2014, natural products and their derivatives, produced by a wide
array of organisms including plants, fungi, and bacteria, accounted
for 65% of all approved small molecule drugs and 73% of approved antibacterial
agents.5 Despite these compelling numbers,
natural product discovery programs, and specifically those for antibiotic
development, have been largely abandoned over the past 30 years by
the pharmaceutical industry for more efficient, and therefore profitable,
high-throughput screening technologies and a combinatorial chemistry
approach to drug discovery. It has been estimated that it takes approximately
3 months of work and $50 000 to isolate and characterize a
single novel natural product due to the time-consuming nature of natural
product discovery, from finding a hit to cultivating or culturing
the natural source to extracting the bioactive compound, and the to
the issue of dereplication, which is the process of identifying known
compounds with bioactivity prior to full isolation.6,7 Over
the past two decades, many strategies utilizing a variety of spectroscopic7−10 methods have been developed to facilitate dereplication for all
types of natural product screening. However, recent focus has shifted
to improve the process of natural product identification and isolation
so that less dereplication is needed to begin with. Bacteria, which
were a robust source of bioactive (especially antibacterial) natural
products beginning in the early 1900s, saw diminished interest by
scientists in the past 30 years due to the high frequency of reisolation
of known compounds. Recently, bacteria have re-emerged as organisms
of interest due to many new methods that have been developed to specifically
target novel natural product production.11 These methods include screening unique bacterial species such as
extremophiles, endophytes (kakadumycins from an endophytic Streptomycete
associated with the fern-leafed grevillea12), and marine bacteria (marinomycins A–D from Marinispora(13)), developing methods for culturing
“unculturable” bacteria (teixobactin from Eleftheria terrae via iChip technology14 and malacidins A and B from Streptomyces
albus(15)), and mixed microbial
culture to mimic the natural, competitive environment and cross talk
between species (pyocyanin produced by a Pseudomonas–Enterobacter dual culture16), which may utilize the bacteria’s thousands of
uncharacterized, silent genes as shown by whole-genome sequencing.17 For example, Garbeva et al. screened a 146 phylogenically
diverse bacterial library in mono- and cocultures and found that 6%
(154/2798 pairs) of interactions induced antibiotic activity against
either Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.18

In addition to developing methods to produce novel antibiotics from
microorganisms, there is also a need for improving the screening techniques
for these producers to reduce false positives, which lead to loss
of time and resources. New techniques for screening bacteria libraries
using tools such as microfluidics19,20 and mass spectrometry21,22 have been developed that allow for rapid and large-scale analysis
of producing bacteria, but these require highly specialized equipment
and instrumentation that may be inaccessible for smaller institutions,
limiting their ability to contribute to the field of antibiotic discovery.
For laboratory-culturable bacteria, the standard “low-tech”
method for assaying bacteria for antibacterial production has been
an agar-based method, similar to the disk diffusion agar method, where
the bacteria to be assayed is spotted onto a solid media agar plate
via pipette or pin replication that has been overlaid or spread with
the pathogen target of interest on top23−25 (Figure 1). Bacteria that produce antibiotics under
these conditions will develop a “halo” or zone of inhibition
around them (Figure 1, D5), where the pathogen has been cleared, which can be observed
without the need for any specialized equipment or instrumentation.
While this method allows for the evaluation of a large number of potential
producers and is simple enough that even minimally trained scientists
such as undergraduates can perform it, it is also highly prone to
error, time consuming (typically taking 2 weeks for a single assay
with growth times), and restricted to organisms that grow well and
have low motility on solid media (Figure 1, B1 shows a high motility bacteria). The
agar method is able to be quantified manually by measuring the size
of the zone of inhibition, but this limits throughput.25 Additionally, since the analysis of antibiotic
production is conducted visually, bacteria that produce only weakly
active compounds or produce active compounds but in low concentrations
may be missed. Herein, we report the development of a new, time-efficient,
high-throughput, and quantitative method for screening bacteria in
a liquid culture that compliments the use of novel organisms and mixed
microbial culture for antibiotic production to further improve the
drug discovery process. We have validated this process by screening >260
bacteria isolated from a variety of environments including bulk and
rhizosphere soil, the phytotelmata of Sarracenia pitcher
plants, desert soil, and freshwater sediment for antibiotic production
against S. aureus and E. coli in monoculture. Further, this method was
adapted to screen coculture mixtures of bacteria, as well.

Results and Discussion
Assay Development
The goals for developing a new bacterial, phenotypic (specifically
antibiotic) screening method were to1. have a reduced assay time compared to traditional
agar method;

2. be robust
enough that even minimally trained scientists can get reliable results;

3. allow for quantification
with error analysis via standard deviation (SD) of antibiotic activity;

4. be amenable to mono- and
coculture analyses.



With these goals
in mind, the assay shown in Figure 2 was developed. For monoculture evaluation, a single
bacterial colony is inoculated in 10% tryptic soy broth (TSB) and
incubated at 25 °C for 24 h (day 1). These overnight cultures
are then pipetted into a 96-well filter bottom plate (n = 4), diluted 15-fold in fresh media (10% TSB), and incubated at
25 °C for 48 h to allow for antibiotic production (days 2–3).
After the 48 h production period, the plate is centrifuged into a
new 96-well round-bottom plate containing the test pathogen in fresh
media (full-strength TSB), allowing for analysis of the cell-free
media containing any excreted secondary metabolites (day 4). After
a final 24 h incubation period at 37 °C, the absorbance is taken
at OD590 to assess pathogen growth in the presence and
absence of culture filtrate (day 5). For coculture evaluation, the
assay is extended to include an additional growth day of the monocultures
in a 96-well assay plate before they are mixed in coculture and allowed
to incubate for 48 h prior to filtration.

Figure 2 Workflow of the monoculture
liquid high-throughput screening method. The 5 day process starts
after the colonies are quadrant-streaked from agar plates and allowed
to grow for 36–48 h. Hits are determined as any inhibition
2 standard deviations from the pathogen in TSB. Strong producers are
categorized as those hits that have ≥30% inhibition.

For our specific library of bacteria, which is
composed of bacteria isolated from both aqueous and rhizosphere soil
samples found in western North Carolina and the southwestern United
States, we found that the general optimal growth conditions were nutrient-poor
media (diluted TSB to 10% of the manufacturer’s recommendation)
and 25 °C. Additionally, due to the small volume in each well,
a 48 h incubation allowed for us to observe antibiotic production
activity without issues associated with longer incubation times such
as cell death due to the lack of nutrients or evaporation. These conditions
can be optimized for any specific bacterial library, and larger culture
volumes can be accommodated with deep-well filter plates. Pathogens, S. aureus and E. coli, were grown under optimal growth conditions of full-strength TSB
and 37 °C.

In total, this assay takes 5–6 days to
complete depending on whether mono- or cocultures are used. The 96-well
plate format allows for an appropriate number replicates to be run
in parallel so that the “hits” are reliable and reproducible.
For analysis of antibiotic production by bacteria in mono- or coculture,
an n = 4 was deemed sufficient to be able to statistically
differentiate (2 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence) a producing
culture compared to the uninhibited pathogen control, which is detailed
in the Supporting Information. Additionally,
we set a threshold of ≥30% inhibition of the pathogen compared
to the uninhibited pathogen control for bacteria to be deemed as “strong
producers” or bacteria that produce either a large quantity
of an antibiotic or a highly potent antibiotic. In a practical sense,
this is a threshold that we found to be amenable to natural product
isolation in our laboratory using standard large-scale culture methods
(6–12 L), which was validated in the isolation pseudopyronine
B from a Pseudomonas soil bacteria,26 but other thresholds could be established based on the
specific goals of an individual screen.

One additional utility
of this screening method is that it is modular and can be readily
adapted for specific growth requirements of the bacteria being screened
(i.e., extended growth time or varying media conditions) and for other
phenotypic screens (i.e., cytotoxic where the filtrate is centrifuged
into mammalian cells). Limitations of this method are that only bacteria
that can be cultured in liquid are able to be screened, bacteria with
erratic growth under standard conditions can lead to confounding results,
and multiculture is limited by the volume of the 96-well plate (typically <200
μL).

Screening in Monoculture
To validate
the screening method, a bacterial library containing bacteria isolated
from a variety of aqueous and rhizosphere soil environments was screened
for antibiotic production using S. aureus and E. coli as representative Gram-positive
and -negative pathogens. 302 bacterial samples were tested for single
production against S. aureus, and 38%
(n = 115) were found to produce antibiotic activity,
with 23 of those 115 being classified as strong producers (≥30%
inhibition) (Figure 3). There were 267 bacterial samples tested for single production
against E. coli, and 34% (n = 90) were found to produce antibiotic activity, with 11 of those
90 being classified as strong producers (≥30% inhibition) (Figure 3). Bacteria that
had irreproducible growth in liquid media at any stage of the protocol
were removed from the final analysis. A representation of the data
output with 95% confidence intervals for the screening of 21 bacteria
is shown in Figure 4. Nonproducers are shown in blue, which were found to not significantly
inhibit the growth of the S. aureus (SA in TSB) compared to that of the TBS-only control. Producers
are shown in yellow and orange, with orange being those that inhibited
the pathogen by ≥30%.

Figure 4 Representative data for 21 bacteria screened
for antibiotic production against S. aureus. Each individual data point has been background-subtracted to remove
absorbance from 32.5% TSB (“TSB only”) and normalized
to the growth of the pathogen (“SA in TSB”), which has
been set to 1. Black dots show individually normalized well values
for each bacterial species (n = 4), colored bars
show the mean of the individually normalized well, and 95% confidence
intervals (±2 standard deviations) are shown as error bars. Blue
bars indicated no inhibition of pathogen, yellow indicate weak inhibition
(<30%), and orange indicate strong inhibition (≥30%) of
pathogen compared to the pathogen-only (−)-control SA in TSB.
Bacteria 400, a Pseudomonas sp., which was found
to strongly inhibit both S. aureus and E. coli, was used as a (+)-control for each individual
assay.

To date, 43 antibiotic producers
have been identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
and DNA sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA genes (see the Supporting Information). Of those identified,
the highest abundant genera were Pseudomonas (37%), Serratia (19%), and Bacillus (14%). Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Brevibacillus, Chromobacterium, Collimonas, Herbaspirillum, Kluyvera, Microbacterium, Staphylococcus, and Streptomyces encompass the remaining identified isolates. Out of these identified
genera, Pseudomonas,26−28Serratia,29Bacillus,30Brevibacterium,31Brevibacillus,32Chromobacterium,33Collimonas,34Staphylococcus,35 and Streptomyces(36) are all known
antibiotic producers. Isolates, which have not yet been found to produce
antibiotic compounds, include Herbaspirillum and Kluyvera.

Screening in Coculture
As has been
discussed, one way to increase the chances of isolating novel compounds
produced by bacteria, and reduce the need for dereplication, is to
use co- or multiculture techniques to elicit the production of small
molecules from silent genes that are not active in monoculture. To
this end, bacteria from the library that were found to not produce
an antibiotic in monoculture were then screened pairwise in coculture,
selected at random, using the adapted protocol described above. Three
hundred and three bacterial pairs were screened against S. aureus, and 14% (n = 43) were
found to have activity with 3.3% (n = 10) showing
≥30% inhibition (Figure 5). Two hundred and seventy-eight bacterial pairs were screened
against E. coli, and 30% (n = 84) were found to have activity with 0% (n =
0) showing ≥30% inhibition (Figure 5). These numbers include single bacteria
that in coculture with any other bacteria caused antibiotic production.
An example of the coculture data is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 5 Total hits in coculture against S. aureus and E. coli.

Figure 6 Representative data for 20 bacteria pairs found
to be nonproducers in monoculture screened for antibiotic production
against S. aureus. Each individual
data point has been background-subtracted to remove absorbance from
32.5% TSB (TSB only) and normalized to the growth of the pathogen
(SA in TSB), which has been set to 1. Black dots show individually
normalized well values for each bacteria pair (n =
4), colored bars show the mean of the individually normalized well,
and 95% confidence intervals (±2 standard deviations) are shown
as error bars. Blue bars indicated no inhibition of pathogen, yellow
indicate weak inhibition (<30%), and orange indicate strong inhibition
(≥30%) of pathogen compared to the pathogen-only (-)-control
SA in TSB. Bacteria 400, a Pseudomonas sp., which
was found to strongly inhibit both S. aureus and E. coli, was used as a (+)-control
for each individual assay.

Conclusions
In summary, the discovery of novel antibiotics
is and will continue to be a worldwide need as antibiotic resistance
continues to rise. To help address this need, we have described the
development of a new method for screening liquid bacteria in mono-
and cocultures for antibiotic production that is rapid, quantitative,
and robust enough that even minimally trained scientists, such as
undergraduates, can perform, which is complimentary to and can be
used as an initial screening tool for other more “high-tech”
methods for antibiotic discovery and analysis in the field. This method
not only allows for the identification of bacteria that produce molecules
in large quantity or ones that are highly active but also allows for
the identification of weakly producing bacteria that may be read as
false negatives in standard agar methods used in the field today.
Mono- and cocultures that were found to be active in our screens are
being scaled for antibiotic isolation using methods previously described.26 Finally, this method can be easily adapted to
other phenotypic screens, such as mechanism of action assays and LC-MSMS
analysis of metabolites, since only the cell-free media with excreted,
bioactive secondary metabolites are being evaluated.

Experimental
Section
General Procedures
All steps were completed with aseptic techniques. All media and glassware
were sterilized via an autoclave at 121 °C for 60 min. All agitation
occurred at 160 rpm in a temperature-controlled console shaker (Excella
E25) at 25 °C. Bacteria in the library were stored at −80
°C as 25% glycerol stocks in 10% tryptic soy broth (TSB, 3 g
BD Bacto TSB powder per 1 L deionized water). From these freezer stocks,
bacteria were quadrant-streaked and grown on 10% tryptic soy agar
(TSA, 3 g BD Bacto TSB powder, and 20 g Bacto agar per 1 L deionized
water) for 36–48 h at 25 °C. Purchased bacteria strains
used were S. aureus (ATCC 29213) and E. coli (ATCC 15022).

Agar Spread Plate Method
The overnight target pathogen suspension (70 μL) was pipetted
onto a 10% TSA plate. A sterilized plastic spreader was used to evenly
spread the pathogen across the plate, and the plates were left to
dry. The desired cell suspension (1.7 μL) was spotted onto dried
plates and monitored up to a week at room temperature for zones of
inhibition against the target pathogen.

Agar Overlay Method
TSA (10%, 4 mL) was melted via microwave and cooled to 50 °C
in a hot water bath. The target pathogen overnight suspension (100
μL) was added to the soft agar, inverted, and poured onto a
prewarmed, 37 °C, 10% TSA (1.5% agar) plate. Plates were slightly
rocked for even coverage and left to dry. The desired cell suspension
(1.7 μL) was spotted onto dried overlay plates and monitored
at room temperature up to a week for zones of inhibition against the
target pathogen.

High-Throughput Liquid Assay Method
Growth Parameters
and Controls
Screened bacteria were grown in 10% TSB at 25
°C. Pathogens were grown in full-strength TSB (30 g BD Bacto
TSB per 1 L deionized water) at 37 °C. For all liquid assays,
the (-)-control was a pathogen in 32.5% TSB (150 μL 10% TSB
+ 50 μL full-strength TSB), and the blank was 32.5% TSB to confirm
no contamination present and to allow for background subtraction in
data analysis (see Figures S2–S4). Additionally, a confirmed producer bacteria from our library (400, Pseudomonas sp.) was used as a (+)-control for all mono-
and coculture assays.

Monoculture
As shown in Figure 2, the 5 day screening
process began with creating liquid bacterial cultures by inoculating
a selected colony into 4 mL of 10% TSB, which was shaken at 25 °C
for 24 h. On the second day, the liquid cultures from day 1 were used
to make 96-well filtration plates (a 0.22 μM hydrophilic low
protein binding Durapore membrane). The filter plates were prepared
with 140 μL of 10% TSB and 10 μL of the appropriate sample
in each well (n = 4). Filter plates were shaken for
48 h. On the third day during the filter plate incubation period,
overnight cultures of S. aureus and E. coli were grown in 4 mL of full-strength TSB from
a selected colony and shaken for 24 h at 37 °C. On the fourth
day, 50 μL of the overnight cultures of S. aureus or E. coli were pipetted into all
wells of a sterile 96-well VWR tissue culture plate except for the
final column, which served as a (+)-positive control and was filled
with 50 μL of full-strength TSB only. Then, the filter plates
were placed directly on top of the newly made plates and were centrifuged
for 10 min at 1000g at 25 °C. This allowed all
cellular material to stay in the filter membrane, while all excreted
secondary metabolites were transported into the new plate. The final
TSB concentration for all wells was 32.5% TSB. The plates were shaken
for 24 h at 37 °C.

On the fifth and final day, plates were
analyzed for absorbance at 590 nm using a Gen5 All-In-One Microplate
Reader software with BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Microplate Reader.
Each plate’s data was individually analyzed using Microsoft
Excel. The average of TSB without pathogen was subtracted from each
well of the 96-well plate to subtract the media background and create
a standard baseline of “0” (TSB only, Figures 4–6). The new average of TSB without pathogen represents the absorbance
of a well, which contains 0% of the pathogen or 100% inhibition of
bacterial growth. Each well was compared to the pathogen absorbance
in TSB (SA in TSB, Figures 4–6) as a ratio of the well/pathogen
in TSB to normalize all values to the pathogen = 1 (“limit
of acceptance”, Figures 4–6). The new average of the
pathogen in TSB represents the absorbance of a well, which contains
100% of the pathogen or 0% inhibition of bacterial growth. The average
and two standard deviations (SDs) of all ratios per bacteria were
used to create a 95% confidence interval of the total pathogen inhibition.
If the bacterial sample had an average of +2 SD below 1, then it qualified
to have antibiotic activity. The bacterial sample qualified to be
a strong producer when at least 30% inhibition occurred against the
pathogen.

Coculture
The high-throughput liquid
assay method for screening cocultures was modified to a 6 day process.
On the first day, selected colonies from agar plates were inoculated
into 4 mL of 10% TSB and shaken for 24 h at 25 °C. On the second
day, 140 μL of 10% TSB and 10 μL of the appropriate liquid
bacterial culture were pipetted into a 96-well VWR tissue culture
plate and shaken for 24 h at 25 °C. This added step allowed each
bacteria an additional 24 h to grow separately before growing in a
coculture. The different bacteria were placed into pairs based on
the order of the 96-well VWR tissue culture plate made on the second
day. The plate was flipped on itself horizontally and vertically or
rotated 180̊ to make the random pairings (Figure S1 in Supporting Information). The resulting coculture
pairs were checked to ensure that no repeats were tested during an
assay. On the third day, 130 μL of 10% TSB was pipetted into
the 96-well filtration plates (a 0.22 μM hydrophilic low protein
binding Durapore membrane), and 10 μL of each bacteria in a
pair were pipetted into a well so that each well contained a total
of 150 μL. The plates were then shaken for 48 h at 25 °C.
The last 3 days of this procedure follow the same methods outlined
in the monoculture screening process.

Microbial Characterization
Gram
Staining
Samples were placed onto a microscope slide by pipetting
10 μL of sterile deionized water and smearing a colony. The
slide was allowed to dry completely and then subjected to gentile
heat fixation via flame. The smear was subjected to crystal violet
(60 s), iodine (60 s), decolorizer (80% ethanol, 10–20 s),
and safranin (60 s). Between each step, the smear was washed thoroughly
with deionized water. Bacterial cells were visualized under bright-field
microscopy at 40× magnification.

Genomic Purification
Bacterial DNA was acquired using a PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit
and protocol. Samples were grown in 4 mL of 10% TSB overnight, and
cells (2 × 109) were harvested via centrifugation.
Protocol for bacterial cell lysate was followed with respect to Gram-staining
results. All samples were subject to purifying genomic DNA using a
spin column-based procedure. DNA elution from the spin column for
each sample was completed twice with a 50 μL PureLink Genomic
Elution Buffer to a total volume on 100 μL. Purified bacterial
DNA was kept at −18 °C.

PCR and Identification
Genus-level identification was determined using 16S rRNA amplification
and DNA sequence analysis. Universal 16S rRNA primers were 27F (AGA
GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG) and 1492R (CGG TTA CCT TGT TAC GAC TT). Polymerase
chain reactions (PCRs) were completed for 50 μL reactions containing
a 5× Phusion green HF buffer (10 μL), 10 mM dNTP (1 μL),
Phusion DNA polymerase (0.5 μL), 10 mM universal primers (2.5
μL), 100 ng/mL template, and nuclease-free water. Thermocycler
was set for initial denaturing at 98 °C (3 min), followed by
29 cycles of 98 °C (30 s), 48 °C (30 s), and 72 °C
(5 min). After 29 cycles were completed, the sample underwent a final
extension at 72 °C (5 min). PCR products were visualized for
size separation on 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/mL ethidium
bromide in 1× TAE. A Quick-Load Purple 2-log DNA ladder (0.1–10.0
kb) was used for size reference. Products (approximately 1460 bp)
were visualized under UV light and purified using QiaQuick PCR purification
kit (Qiagen). Purified PCR product send-off was prepared in a total
volume of 15 μL for sequencing at 4 ng/μL products, 25
pmol 27F primer, and nuclease-free water. Samples were sent to GeneWiz
(Cambridge, MA) for Sanger sequencing. Sanger sequencing results were
cross-checked with the National Center for Biotechnology Information
and Ribosomal Database Project for genus-level identification.
