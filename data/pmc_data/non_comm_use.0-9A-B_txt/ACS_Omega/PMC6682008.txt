Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is a cofactor in the production
of various signaling molecules including nitric oxide, dopamine, adrenaline,
and noradrenaline. BH4 levels are critical for processes
associated with cardiovascular function, inflammation, mood, pain,
and neurotransmission. Increasing pieces of evidence suggest that
BH4 is upregulated in chronic pain. Sepiapterin reductase
(SPR) catalyzes both the reversible reduction of sepiapterin to dihydrobiopterin
(BH2) and 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin to BH4 within the BH4 pathway. Therefore, inhibition of SPR
by small molecules can be used to control BH4 production
and ultimately alleviate chronic pain. Here, we have used various
in silico and in vitro experiments to show that tranilast, licensed
for use in bronchial asthma, can inhibit sepiapterin reduction by
SPR. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tranilast
can bind to human SPR (hSPR) at the same site as sepiapterin including
S157, one of the catalytic triad residues of hSPR. Colorimetric assays
revealed that tranilast was nearly twice as potent as the known hSPR
inhibitor, N-acetyl serotonin. Tranilast was able
to inhibit hSPR activity both intracellularly and extracellularly
in live cells. Triple quad mass spectrophotometry of cell lysates
showed a proportional decrease of BH4 in cells treated
with tranilast. Our results suggest that tranilast can act as a potent
hSPR inhibitor and therefore is a valid candidate for drug repurposing
in the treatment of chronic pain.

==== Body
Introduction
Chronic pain (CP) is
a major problem worldwide, and can be a consequence
of multiple factors including lifestyle, damage to the somatosensory
system, compromised immune system, and complex disorders such as cancer
and diabetes.1,2 CP can be severely debilitating,
making it one of the leading causes of economic burden on society
as a result of work days lost and an increased probability of early
exit from the labor force.3−6 Recent epidemiological reports have estimated the
prevalence of CP as 43, 39, 29, and 20% in the UK,7 Brazil,8 Hong Kong,9 and US10 populations,
respectively. Treatment of CP is notoriously challenging, with patients’
lack of response to analgesics generally offering a poor outlook in
long term pain relief. This forces a “trial and error”
process in the pharmacological intervention of CP, with patients often
developing tolerances to drugs over time.11 Classical analgesics like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsant drugs
such as gabapentin have shown limited efficacy in the treatment of
CP and therefore drugs like opioids are generally used.12−15 However, these drugs are strongly addictive in nature and can affect
numerous off-target pathways causing severe side effects.11,13,16,17 The existence of comorbidities like depression, anxiety, and complex
disorders can further complicate the management of CP.18 Therefore, effective treatment of CP remains
an urgent unmet need in society. CP has multiple aetiologies that
can significantly alter long-term nociceptive signaling in patients.
While an array of risk factors and physiological processes driving
the development of persistent pain have been revealed, identification
of many CP-linked pathophysiological mechanisms remains incomplete.19−21 Because of the elusiveness in the origin of CP in individuals and
its progression, CP has no specific validated target that can be explored
for drug design.20,22 A wide range of potential targets
have been explored for CP treatment including inflammatory molecules,
ion-channels, microRNAs, and cell receptors.23−27

Genetic analyses have revealed an association
between polymorphisms
in the GCH1 gene, the rate-limiting enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4) production, and the prevalence of CP.28−32 Elevated levels of BH4 corresponded with a higher sensitivity
to pain stimuli in animal models of peripheral nerve injury.28 BH4 is a cofactor for the aromatic
amino acid hydroxylases, alkylglycerol monooxygenase, and nitric oxide
synthases, involved in the synthesis of many neurotransmitters including
serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, and nitric oxide (Figure S1).33,34 Therefore,
BH4 is a lucrative pathway for exploring drug design in
CP and its linked comorbidities involved with these neurotransmitters.35 Several other molecules in the pathway including
sepiapterin reductase (SPR) and GCH1 feedback-regulating protein,
have also been linked to mood disorders and antidepressant functions.33,36,37 SPR is the terminal enzyme in
the de novo synthesis of BH4.34 SPR catalyzes both the reversible reduction of sepiapterin to dihydrobiopterin
(BH2), and 6-pyruvoyl-tetrahydrobiopterin to BH4 within the pathway.34 Modulation of BH4 levels by inhibiting SPR has been explored and many promising
inhibitors of SPR have been developed.28,38,39 However, to the best of our knowledge no SPR inhibitor
is currently used for CP treatment.

Tranilast (N-3′,4′-dimethoxycinnamoyl-anthranilic
acid, Rizaben) is a synthetic analogue of a tryptophan metabolite,
originally identified as an anti-allergic agent and used in the treatment
of conditions such as bronchial asthma, keloids, atopic dermatitis,
and allergic conjunctivitis.40 The mechanism
of action of tranilast in clinical applications is thought to originate
from its ability to inhibit the release of chemical mediators from
mast cells, thus suppressing hypersensitivity reactions.41,42 Tranilast can potentially inhibit TGF-β1 signaling and matrix
metalloproteinase secretion.43 Advantageous
effects of tranilast have been recorded in a number of other disease
states including multiple sclerosis,44 cardiovascular45 and autoimmune disorders,46,47 and various cancers43,48,49 due to its anti-inflammatory properties. It acts through a range
of inhibitory pathways including a reduction in iNOS expression and enzyme activity in an inflammation cell model using
microglia,44 lowering IL-6 secretion in
endothelial cells,50 suppression of the
pro-inflammatory COX2 in IL-1β stimulated fibroblasts51 and both TNF-α and IFN-γ production,
while increasing anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 production.52 Despite its wide range of effects, the relevant
anti-inflammatory mechanisms of tranilast are still not completely
understood.

Current associations in the literature directly
focusing on tranilast
in the treatment of pain only reveal one study of the drug’s
effects on pelvic pain caused by endometriosis, where 300 mg/day tranilast
treatment over six months reduced the average numerical rating scale
(NRS) of low back or lower abdominal pain from 6.25 to 3.63 by the
end of the study administration.53 Here,
we identify a previously unknown inhibitory role of tranilast on SPR
activity thereby decreasing BH4 production. No previous
publications or reports linking tranilast to either inhibition of
the BH4 pathway or interaction with SPR have been identified.

Results
Tranilast
Can Form Stable Interactions with human SPR at the
Same Site as Sepiapterin
The molecular docking of all compounds
in the LOPAC1280 library revealed sepiapterin as the best
ligand for human SPR (hSPR) as it showed the lowest score (−52.09).
The sepiapterin in the docked hSPR–sepiapterin complex and
crystal structure of mouse SPR–sepiapterin showed a complete
overlap which gave us confidence in our docking parameters (Figure 1). To filter potential
compounds that can compete with sepiapterin binding, we selected compounds
with binding scores less than −35 and screened their interactions
to sepiapterin binding residues of hSPR (Table S1 and Figure S2). These compounds
were then assessed by in vitro protein assays for their SPR inhibiting
potential (Table S1). Tranilast, nordihydroguaiaretic
acid (NDGA), and SPRi3 (Figure 2) all gave a good docking score (between −39 and −42)
which indicated their SPR binding potential. The residues S157, Y170,
G199, and D257 of SPR formed hydrogen bonds with sepiapterin. In the
starting structure, tranilast could bind to residues S157, Y170, and
D257 while NDGA and SPRi3 could only bind to residues Y170 and D257
on hSPR (Figure 3, Table S1).

Figure 1 Overlay of mouse and hSPR. The mouse and
hSPR are shown in transparent
green and yellow cartoons, respectively. The NADPH bound to mouse
and hSPR is shown in light and dark blue, while sepiapterin is shown
in orange and yellow, respectively.
The sepiapterin docked on hSPR overlapped over sepiapterin in the
crystal structure of mouse SPR.

Figure 2 Molecular structures of compounds used for carrying out MD simulations
with hSPR. These include sepiapterin, tranilast, NDGA, and SPRi3.
Sepiapterin is a product in the reduction of PPS in the de novo pathway
and the substrate for hSPR in the salvage pathway (see Figure S1 for additional information). The sepiapterin–hSPR
complex was used as the target site for in silico screening of the
LOPAC1280 compound library that identified tranilast and
NDGA as small molecule inhibitors of hSPR. SPRi3 is a synthetic derivate
of NAS reported in the literature as a potent inhibitor of SPR.28

(b) hSPR–tranilast, (c) hSPR–NDGA, and (d) hSPR–SPRi3
complexes are shown in the figure. The hydrogen bonds between hSPR
and drugs are shown in green. The drugs are shown in the colored bubble
(sepiapterin in yellow, tranilast in purple, NDGA in green, and SPRi3
in blue) with polar groups within the drug structure indicated (red
= negative and blue = positive). hSPR is shown in cartoon. The residues
of hSPR interacting with the drugs in Molsoft ICM visualization are
labeled and shown in sticks.

We carried out 500 ns long simulations of sepiapterin, tranilast,
NDGA, and SPRi3 complexed with hSPR to investigate the stability of
their interactions. The lowest root mean squared deviation (RMSD)
was observed in the hSPR simulations for the hSPR–tranilast
complex in comparison to simulations of hSPR–sepiapterin, hSPR–NDGA,
and hSPR–SPRi3 complexes (Figure 4a). The residues 55–59, 104–127,
160–169, and 204–230 showed a higher root mean squared
fluctuation (RMSF) in all the hSPR–ligand simulations (Figure 4b). The hSPR in complex
with sepiapterin and tranilast showed relatively similar RMSF values.
The hSPR in hSPR–NDGA and hSPR–SPRi3 simulations showed
higher RMSF values around residue 155–160, which also included
S157 and L158 of the binding site. This indicated that binding site
residues were more flexible in hSPR–NDGA and hSPR–SPRi3
compared to the hSPR–sepiapterin and hSPR–tranilast
simulations.

Figure 4 Comparison of hSPR behavior in simulations of hSPR–drug
complexes. (a) RMSD and (b) RMSF plots were used to compare the deviations
and fluctuations in the hSPR structure in the simulations of hSPR–sepiapterin
(Sep), hSPR–tranilast (Trn), hSPR–NDGA, and hSPR–SPRi3
complexes. The hSPR–tranilast complex showed the lowest RMSD
and least fluctuations in the 500 ns long MD simulation.

The stability of binding interactions between hSPR
and ligands
was also compared in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the
starting structure, S157, Y170, G199, and D257 of hSPR formed hydrogen
bonds with sepiapterin. Sepiapterin also formed a hydrogen bond with
NADPH. The hydrogen bonds between hSPR D257(OD1)–sepiapterin(H54)
and NADPH(H5N)–sepiapterin(O1) showed 80 and 76.6% occupancy
in the hSPR–sepiapterin simulation (Figure S3a). This reflected that the position of sepiapterin was stable
in the simulation as D257 and NADPH form the two opposite ends of
the sepiapterin binding pocket. The hydrogen bonds between sepiapterin
and S157 and Q206 residues of hSPR showed 50–60% occupancy.
The interaction with Y170 was not sampled beyond 70 ns of the simulation
as the loop formed by L161 to W167 was flexible in the simulation
and changed the orientation of Y170 (Table 1a).

The grey boxes indicate no hydrogen bond of the hSPR residue with

In the starting
structure, tranilast could bind to hSPR residues
S157, Y170, and D257 (Table S1). The aromatic
ring of tranilast stacked with the nicotinamide ring of NADPH after
∼80 ns of the simulations (Figure S4). All the interactions except with D257 were sampled for the majority
of the 500 ns long simulation (Table 1b). The loop harboring D257 showed fluctuations and
instead L158, C159, and Q206 formed hydrogen bonds with tranilast
and anchored it in the simulation (Table 1b and Figure S3b). NDGA could bind to only Y170 and D257 of hSPR in the starting
structure. Both these interactions were not stable in the simulations
and instead S157 and D215 of hSPR formed hydrogen bonds with NDGA
(Table 1c). As NDGA
is a bigger molecule, it could not fully enter the binding site and
therefore may not be an effective inhibitor of hSPR. In the starting
structure, SPRi3 could bind to S157, Y170, Q206, and D257. However,
none of these interactions were stable as the loops S157 to Y170 and
the C-terminal loop harboring D257 were very flexible in the simulations
(Table 1d).

Tranilast
Can Decrease hSPR Activity in a Direct Protein Inhibition
Assay
To determine inhibitor potency of compounds with a
docking score below −35, pharmacological analysis of five-point
dose response curves was performed for IC50 concentration
determination (Table S1). Interactions
of all these compounds with sepiapterin binding residues of hSPR were
also screened after docking in Molsoft ICM (Table S1). Dose response curves for N-acetylserotonin
(NAS), NDGA, and tranilast followed a classical sigmoidal inhibition
profile. These were determined using the GraphPad Prism three-parameter
nonlinear curve fits and revealed quantifiable average IC50 concentrations for NAS (11.61 μM), NDGA (8.26 μM), and
tranilast (5.89 μM) (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Five-point dose response curves for hSPR inhibition by
tranilast
and known inhibitor NAS, measured through 405 nm absorbance of sepiapterin
breakdown. IC50 concentrations of both compounds were calculated
using GraphPad Prism’s three-parameter nonlinear fit. Data
is presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3).

Tranilast Can Decrease hSPR Activity in the
Cellular System
Enzymatic activity of hSPR was initially
analyzed in lysates of
SH-SY5Y cultures transfected with hSPR or empty vector. The activity
was measured through the hSPR-induced breakdown of sepiapterin, quantifiable
colorimetrically at 405 nm, to BH2. Tranilast treatment
at 50 μM completely inhibited hSPR activity in transfected lysates,
reducing hSPR activity equivalent to basal levels observed in nontransfected
cells (p ≤ 0.0001). There were no significant
differences as a result of 50 μM tranilast treatment between
any wild-type (WT) or vector transfected samples (Figure 6a). Cell-free assay controls
showed a significant hSPR-induced reduction in the sepiapterin colorimetric
absorbance between controls containing or lacking recombinant hSPR
protein (p ≤ 0.0001).

Figure 6 Inhibitory properties

sepiapterin in (a) cell lysates of SH-SY5Y cultures transfected with
hSPR or vector, extracted using freeze–thaw lysis, and (b)
live cultures of SH-SY5Y cells transfected with hSPR or vector, along
with extracellular hSPR in the media released from these SH-SY5Y cells.
Panel (a) shows (i) cell-free positive controls with or without recombinant
hSPR protein confirming hSPR enzyme activity in the assay system and
(ii) lysates from SH-SY5Y cells transfected with hSPR showing significant
inhibition in the presence of tranilast. There were no significant
changes observed between vector transfected and WT cultures after
tranilast treatment. In the panel (b), (i) cell-free positive controls
with or without recombinant hSPR protein confirming hSPR enzyme activity,
(ii) intracellular hSPR activity within both transfected and WT SH-SY5Y
cultures showed significant inhibition in the presence of tranilast,
and (iii) extracellular hSPR activity in culture media from transfected
SH-SY5Y cells was significantly reduced after tranilast treatment.
There were no significant changes observed in WT culture media in
the presence of tranilast. Data is presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3), one-way ANOVA with the Tukey’s posthoc test
was performed (** = p ≤ 0.01, **** = p ≤ 0.0001, n.s. = non-significant).

The inhibitory properties of tranilast at 50 μM
on hSPR was
then investigated intracellularly in live cultures of hSPR-transfected
SH-SY5Y cells, and in released hSPR enzymes present within the cell
media used to culture the transfected cells. Cell-free assay controls
were consistent with previous experiments (Figure 6b). Transfected SH-SY5Y cells exhibited a
significant increase in hSPR activity intracellularly compared to
nontransfected cultures (p ≤ 0.0001); hSPR
activity was also quantifiable at lower levels in nontransfected cells.
In comparison to the initial assay using lysates of transfected SH-SY5Y
cells, where a 50 μM treatment caused the complete inhibition
in transfected samples, tranilast had a reduced effect in the intracellular
assay, causing an approximate 52.7% decrease in mean absorbance change
at 405 nm in transfected cells versus nontreated positive control
(Figure 6b).

Low levels of hSPR activity were also quantified in the media used
to culture the SH-SY5Y cells, with a significant increase in the sepiapterin
breakdown observed in hSPR-transfected cells versus nontransfected
cells. Tranilast treatment at 50 μM caused a decrease in the
hSPR-induced sepiapterin absorbance reduction in media collected from
transfected SH-SY5Y cultures but caused no significant effects in
media from nontransfected cultures (Figure 6b).

Quantification of BH4 in Cell
Lysates by Triple Quadrupole
Mass Spectrometry
The BH4 levels in the SH-SY5Y
cell lysates were measured using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry
(QQQ-MS). Treatment with increasing concentrations of tranilast caused
a significant incremental decrease in the sepiapterin-induced BH4 production intracellularly in SH-SY5Y cells (p ≤ 0.0001 for all concentrations versus untreated control, Figure 7). Tranilast treatment
at 30 and 100 μM caused 24.3 and 41.5% reductions in the BH4 peak area integration, respectively, in comparison to untreated
cells performed in the MassHunter software. A maximal mean percentage
reduction in the quantified peak area integration of 56.3% was achieved
at a tranilast concentration of 300 μM (Figure 7).

Data is presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3), one-way
ANOVA with the Tukey’s posthoc test was performed (**** = p ≤ 0.0001).

Tranilast Has No Effect on Cellular Metabolism and Viability
at the Tested Concentrations
Analysis was performed using
both the CellTiter 96 non-radioactive cell proliferation assay and
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Figure S5) to identify whether tranilast exhibited any effects
on SH-SY5Y cell metabolism or viability. No significant decrease in
either cellular viability or cellular metabolism was observed at any
concentration of tranilast after 24 h in comparison to the dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle control (p ≥ 0.05).
There was no quantifiable difference in the assay readout after tranilast
addition in cell free controls (variances observed here in comparison
to vehicle controls are typically due to fluorescent, colored, or
luminescent compounds).

Tranilast Had No Effect on Key Enzyme Protein
Expressions after
24 h Treatment
Gene expression analysis by quantitative real
time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) run on 24 h tranilast-treated
SH-SY5Y cells revealed a downregulation in SPR and
an upregulation in both STAT1 and STAT3. The SPR mean expression decreased by 35.8%, while STAT1 and STAT3 increased by 90.3 and 64.3%,
respectively (Figure S6). However, the
western blot analysis of GCH1, SPR, or STAT3 intracellular protein
revealed no significant expression change after 24 h treatment with
tranilast (Figures 7 and 8).

and tranilast-treated protein extracts are shown in each gel. Full
images of WB gels are available in Figure S7. Data is presented as mean ± SEM (n = 3),

samples was performed for each set of experiments.

Tranilast-Reduced Reactive Oxygen Species
in Cytokine-Stimulated
Cells
Stimulation of SH-SY5Y cultures with TNF-α and
IFN-γ for 24 h caused a 6.97-fold increase in measured reactive
oxygen species (ROS) using H2DCFDA fluorophore dye in flow
cytometry quantification. Tranilast addition to the samples caused
no significant anti-inflammatory properties at 10 μM, but a
significant decrease in reduction of cytokine-induced ROS was observed
at 100 μM treatment, reducing the average median fluorophore
reading by 29.7% in comparison to untreated cytokine-stimulated controls
(p ≤ 0.01, Figure 9).

Discussion
BH4 is an essential molecule in various processes associated
with cardiovascular function, mood, inflammation, pain, and neurotransmission.34 The homeostasis of BH4 is tightly
regulated by the de novo, salvage, and recycling pathways.34 The de novo pathway is of interest in neuropathic
pain research, as it is significantly amplified in response to hyperactive
or damaged peripheral nociceptors. After axonal injury, BH4 concentrations increase in sensory neurons as a result of GCH1 upregulation, the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo
pathway.54 SPR is another key enzyme in
the production of BH4 by both the de novo and salvage pathways.34 Inhibition of SPR has been shown to be effective
in the reduction of CP and pain hypersensitivity, affiliated with
an increased level of BH4.28,55 Inhibition
of SPR has the benefit of no known associated neurological or cardiovascular
side effects, with residual BH4 still available via the
recycling pathway.28,56,57 Here, we demonstrate that tranilast can be used to control BH4 production by inhibiting the activity of SPR. Tranilast has
been used as an anti-allergic drug since 1982 and is licensed for
use in Japan and South Korea for treating bronchial asthma.40,58 However, to the best of our knowledge, the inhibitory activity of
tranilast on SPR has not been explored previously.

Molecular
modeling and MD simulations were used to screen suitable
inhibitors for hSPR. The strategy identified compounds which could
occupy the maximum available space in the binding site, so as to effectively
compete with sepiapterin. The modeling studies showed a plausible
binding model of tranilast. Similar to sepiapterin, the rigid planar
structure of tranilast with ideally positioned heteroatoms facilitated
the formation of hydrogen bonds with the key residues of hSPR. The
initial docking results suggested that tranilast can use one of its
ether-linked methyl groups to form a hydrogen bond to D257 (Figure 3b). However, this
interaction was not stable in simulations, and instead Q206 formed
a hydrogen bond with O1 on tranilast (Figure S3b). The ring harboring the carboxyl group on tranilast could stack
with the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH (Figure S4). The carboxyl group of tranilast is deprotonated at a physiological
pH as it has a pKa of 3.25.59 The oxygen within the carboxyl group of tranilast
could form hydrogen bonds with S157 and Y170, two of the key interactions,
as both S157 and Y170 form a part of the catalytic triad of hSPR.60 These interactions were mostly stable in the
simulations (Figure S3b, Table 1b). The hydrogen bond formed
between NDGA and NADPH was stable however the hydrogen bond with the
binding site residues of hSPR, notably S157, was flexible in the simulation
(Figure S3c). Similarly, the interactions
between hSPR binding residues and SPRi3 were not stable in the simulations
(Figure S3d). All these results suggested
that tranilast could effectively block the interaction of sepiapterin
with hSPR.

The inhibition of hSPR by tranilast was assessed
by various techniques
(Figure 10). Dose–response
curves generated in hSPR–drug in vitro binding assays utilizing
the colorimetric properties of sepiapterin revealed that tranilast
was nearly twice as potent as the known inhibitor NAS (Figure 5). The potency of the drug
was lower in the cellular assays performed (Figure 6), most likely due to the barrier of both
tranilast and the assay reaction mix having to penetrate the cellular
membrane prior to interacting with intracellular hSPR. It is noteworthy
that the IC50 of tranilast calculated in the cellular assays
was still lower than the 300 μM peak plasma concentrations that
has been previously quantified after therapeutic dosages in patients.40,61 As a result of this, it is plausible to assume that therapeutic
dosages may reach concentrations high enough to effectively inhibit
SPR enzymatic activity in vivo. More recently, there have been studies
into improving the bioavailability of tranilast further. The development
of a crystalline form of tranilast significantly improved gastric
dissolution from the oral intake by approximately 60-fold, and thus,
higher peak concentrations were observed.62 QQQ-MS quantification of cell lysates revealed a tranilast-dependent
significant reduction in quantifiable BH4 concentrations
in vitro (Figure 7).
This is consistent with the aforementioned cell-free colorimetric
assays where tranilast inhibited sepiapterin reduction activity of
hSPR (Figure 5).

Figure 10 Tetrahydrobiopterin
pathway, depicting key regions of SPR activity,
and the various techniques performed to assess this under treatment
with tranilast (figure amended from ref (33)).

A number of compounds have been tested for their potential
hSPR
inhibiting activity previously. These include derivatives of NAS28,63,64 like SPRi3, and sulfa drugs such
as sulfasalazine.39 The efficacy of these
inhibitors has been tested in various experimental set ups. In fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based experiments, SPRi3 has shown
a 25-fold higher binding affinity for hSPR compared to NAS (IC50 74 nM vs 1.9 μM for NAS).28 SPRi3 could efficiently reduce biopterin levels in a cell-based
assay (IC50 5.2 μM vs 54 μM for NAS).28 However, SPRi3 has a relatively low potency
and a short half-life, so a synthetic derivative of SPRi3, QM385,
was developed. QM385 has shown promising results in animal studies,
but no human trials have been reported yet.63 Treatment with QM385 in vitro resulted in a distinctly reduced proliferation
of CD4+ T cells, while in vivo mice studies showed that 3 days of
consecutive oral administration of QM385 greatly reduced the number
of inflammatory T cells.86 These results
are very similar to the antiproliferative effect seen in tranilast;
it is possible many of tranilast’s reported therapeutic benefits
seen in proliferative disorders are influenced by SPR inhibition as
is apparent with QM385.63 In humans, tranilast
has a half-life of approximately 5 h, and reaches a peak concentration
in plasma of 30–300 μM, 2 h after oral administration
(600 mg/day).61,65 It has been shown to be a relatively
safe drug after years in clinical usage, presenting minimal long-term
side effects and is generally well accepted by patients.42 The IC50 of QM385 quantified in FRET
experiments was found to be 1.49 ± 1.66 nM.63 In a cellular activity assay, NAS- and sulfasalazine-inhibited
hSPR with an IC50 of 3.1 μM and 23 nM, respectively.66 However, in our direct hSPR competing assay
NAS and tranilast showed an IC50 of 11.61 and 5.89 μM,
respectively.

High hSPR mRNA expression has been correlated
significantly with
poor survival prognosis in neuroblastoma patients.61 Inhibitory drugs of hSPR have also shown promising results
in the treatment of various cancers. Sulfasalazine has shown antiproliferative
effects in both neuroblastomal cell lines and mice xenografted by
a MYCN-amplified neuroblastomal cell line.65 Recent work has shown that inhibition of BH4 by blocking hSPR using QM385 could be a viable way to abrogate
pro-inflammatory auto-aggressive T cells in T-cell-driven pathological
diseases.63 However, this work also suggested
that stimulation of BH4 by overexpression of GCH1 could be a novel way to enhance antitumor immunity, as mice with
intraperitoneal administration of BH4 experienced slower
tumor growth.63 No tumor growth was observed
in mice with overexpressed GCH1.63 Tranilast has been shown to reduce proliferation in various
cancer models43,67−69 notably gastric
tumours,49,70 breast cancer,71 prostate cancer,72 and lymphoid cancers.73 It has also shown anti-inflammatory effects
by reducing production of cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ.52 However, to the best of our knowledge, correlation
between decreased cell proliferation and hSPR inhibition by tranilast
has not been explored. In our experiments, tranilast significantly
reduced ROS formation in pro-inflammatory conditions at 100 μM,
simulated through cytokine treatment with TNF-α and IFN-γ
(Figure 9). We suggest
that this could be functioning through the blockage of the de novo
formation of BH4, and thus reducing the capacity of BH4 to act as a redox active cofactor in NOS activity. In general,
drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) have reduced molecular
weights (MW) to facilitate passive lipid-mediated transport penetration
of the blood–brain barrier (BBB); the mean MW value for the
marketed CNS drug is 310.0, which rises up to 377.0 for the mean MW
of all marketed orally active drugs.74,75 Tranilast’s
MW of 327.3 falls close to this mean value. This has been shown in
vivo, where tranilast was able to enter the CNS, penetrate the BBB,
and be rapidly distributed and eliminated throughout the brain tissue.76 This suggests that tranilast would be able to
access and interact with damaged sensory neurons and macrophages at
the site of nerve damage.

Gene expression analysis of tranilast-treated
SH-SY5Y cells revealed
a downregulation in SPR and an upregulation in both STAT1 and STAT3 (Figure S6). We propose that the antagonistic feedback mechanisms present
between BH4 and l-phenylalanine homeostasis in
the de novo pathway can act to increase the expression of GCH1 upstream after tranilast treatment. This could be explained
by the observed increase in STAT1 and STAT3 expressions in response to reduced BH4 levels, both genes
that regulate GCH1. However, western blot analysis
of tranilast-treated cells revealed no significant change in SPR,
GCH1, or STAT3 (Figure 8). The correlation between mRNA and protein is not always linear.77 STAT1 and STAT3 are also controlled by post-translational
modifications such as tyrosine phosphorylation and SUMOylation which
could explain this inconsistency.78,79 It is also
possible that the protein levels may only correlate to RNA expression
changes after an extended temporal delay beyond the 24 h used in our
experiments.

The clear association between hSPR inhibition and
suppression in
the perceived pain could explain the findings in the clinical trial
undertaken at the Kumamoto University, where the study group scored
lower pain NRS scores after 6 months of treatment with tranilast.53 In this case, tranilast may have been inhibiting
hSPR activity, thus reducing BH4 concentrations. Lower
BH4 levels can decrease the production of pro-inflammatory
molecules such as ROS and NO that have been linked in the literature
to induce neuropathic pain through various mechanisms.80−82

Repurposing the roles of existing therapeutics such as tranilast
could contribute in the novel identification of small molecule analgesics
for the treatment of CP. These results also offer a platform to evaluate
and elucidate the structure–activity relationship between tranilast
and hSPR. Tranilast could be used as a parent structure to undertake
chemical modification for future drug design of novel analogues. The
analgesic effect of tranilast should be validated in animal models
of CP and subsequent clinical drug trials in CP patients.

Methods
Molecular Docking
Docking of compounds and scoring
calculations were performed using the ICM molecular modeling software
(Molsoft LLC, San Diego, CA, USA). The crystal structure of hSPR (PDB
id: 4HWK) was
used as the receptor for docking and screening of potential compounds.834HWK has a resolution of 2.40 Å and covers 4–257
residues out of total 258 residues in the functional protein. It includes
NADP and sulfapyridine bound to hSPR. The structures of chemical compounds
were obtained from the LOPAC1280 library from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK). This library also contains sepiapterin, the natural substrate
of the SPR. A crystal structure of sepiapterin bound to mouse SPR
with a resolution of 1.95 Å (PDB id: 1SEP) was used to predict the sepiapterin
binding site in hSPR.84 The mouse and hSPR
sequences show an overall alignment of 73%, with 97% similarity in
the NADP and sepiapterin binding sites. We carried out flexible ligand
docking in the grid generated around the predicted sepiapterin binding
site. The docking poses were scored by the ICM scoring function which
is optimized to rank order docking hits according to their binding
affinity. A lower ICM score indicates the greater probability of a
ligand having a high affinity to the receptor. We also carried out
modeling and docking of a published SPR inhibitor, SPRi3, to compare
the binding score with those of the commercially available compounds
in the LOPAC1280 library.28

ICM software uses Monte Carlo simulations to globally optimize a
set of ligand internal coordinates in the space of grid potential
maps calculated for the protein (receptor) pocket.85 The grid potential maps of the protein pocket account for
hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions,
and electrostatic potential.85 The low
energy conformations of compounds are generated outside the protein
binding pocket and these are then used as starting structures for
docking. The predicted score is calculated as the weighted (α1 to α5) sum of the ligand–protein
van der Waals interactions and internal force field energy of the
ligand (ΔEIntFF), free energy changes
due to conformational energy loss upon ligand binding (TΔSTor), hydrogen bonding interactions
(ΔEHBond), hydrogen bond donor–acceptor
desolvation energy (ΔEHBDesol),
solvation electrostatic energy upon ligand binding (ΔESolEl), hydrophobic free energy gain (ΔEHPhob), and a size correction term proportional
to the number of ligand atoms (Qsize)85  

For the initial screening of potential inhibitors of hSPR, the
thoroughness value for the Monte Carlo run length was set at three.
Multiple docking and rescoring attempts, utilizing varying grid sizes
around the sepiapterin binding site, were performed with the compound
library. This was carried out to identify potential inhibitors showing
consistent scores of less than −35 across docking attempts.

MD Simulations
We carried out 500 ns long MD simulations
using the ligand and hSPR complex of four ligands as the starting
structures. These included hSPR–sepiapterin, hSPR–SPRi3,
hSPR–NDGA, and hSPR–tranilast complexes. The parameters
for the ligands were generated in the antechamber module of the AMBER
software using the GAFF force field.86 Simulations
were carried out using the ff14SB force field in AMBER16.87 One sodium ion was added to neutralize the hSPR–tranilast
complex. The other complexes were neutral and did not require any
addition of counter ions. Solvation using TIP3P water molecules was
performed in the xleap module of the AMBER16 program.87 The system was placed in a periodic box whose boundaries
extended to at least 10 Å from any solute atom and the topology
and coordinate files were generated in the xleap module of AMBER16.

Standard equilibration protocols were used for initial minimization
of the structure. The first round of equilibration with explicit solvent
and ions involved 1000 steps of the steepest descent, followed by
1000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. A 300 ps MD
equilibration was performed in which the protein–ligand complex
was constrained, whereas the solvent and ion (where applicable) were
allowed to equilibrate. The system was gently heated from 0 to 300
K with a time constant of 0.5 ps. This was followed by subsequent
rounds of MD simulation, at constant pressure and 300 K, for 1 ns.
The constraints were gradually relaxed until no constraints were applied
to the system. The final MD simulations were carried in AMBER16 for
500 ns. The periodic boundary conditions were defined by the PME algorithm
and the nonbonded cut-off was set to 10 Å.88 Hydrogen mass repartitioning was carried out and an integration
time step of 4 fs was used.89 Covalent
bonds involving hydrogen atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm
with a tolerance of 0.0001 Å.90 All
the simulations were carried out at a constant pressure of 1 atm and
constant temperature of 300 K. The temperature and pressure was maintained
using a Berendsen weak coupling thermostat.91 The final production run without restraints was carried out for
a continuous 500 ns and the frames were collected every 10 ps. Analyses
of the trajectory were performed using the cpptraj92 module of AMBER16 and the program VMD93 was used for visualization.

Cell-Free Direct hSPR Enzyme
Activity Assay
Activity
of hSPR was determined colorimetrically by measuring the percentage
decrease in sepiapterin absorbance at 405 nm. The assays were run
on transparent 96-well plates, reaction mixes containing 50 μL
of a 5-point dilution series of tranilast (final concentrations 0–375
μM) in H2O, 50 μL of the enzyme mix containing
3 ng/μL hSPR (Genway BioTech, San Diego, US), 2 mM NADPH, 400
μg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5) (all Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), and 100 μL of 300
μM sepiapterin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, US) diluted
in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). Assay controls of NAS
as a known hSPR inhibitor, and enzyme mix lacking hSPR were run in
parallel to confirm that the observed effects were a result of tranilast
activity. Assay mix absorbance was measured at the start of the assay
after sepiapterin addition, and after 1 h of incubation at 37 °C,
using an Infinite F50 microplate reader (Tecan, Männedorf,
Switzerland).

Cellular hSPR Activity Assays
Cultures
of human neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Thermo Scientific Waltham, USA) in 24-well culture plates
up to 80% confluency. On the day of transfection, spent media was
aspirated and 500 μL of fresh media was added. A diluted DNA
transfection mixture was prepared with 500 ng of hSPR DNA in 25 μL
of the Opti-MEM medium (Thermo Scientific Waltham, USA) per each well
to be transfected and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. This
was combined with a transfection reagent mixture containing 1.5 μL
of polyethylenimine (PEI) in 25 μL of the Opti-MEM medium per
each well to be transfected and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Fifty microliters of the complete transfection mixture was added to
each well and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C.

For extracellular
quantification of hSPR activity following cell lysis, the cultures
were detached using 200 μL of trypsin, resuspended with 300
μL of PBS, and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min.
The pellet was resuspended in 70 μL of H2O and subjected
to four freeze–thaw cycles from dry ice to a heat block at
37 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min and the supernatant collected. The assays were run on
transparent 96-well plates, reaction mixes containing 50 μL
of the cell lysate supernatant, 50 μL of enzyme mix containing
2 mM NADPH, 400 μg/mL of BSA, 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5), and 100 μL of a mixture of 300 μM sepiapterin
and 50 μM tranilast diluted in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 6.5). Assay well absorbance at 405 nm was measured directly after
sepiapterin and tranilast addition, and following 1 h of incubation
at 37 °C on a microplate reader.

For quantification of
hSPR activity in live cells, the cells were
cultured on 48 well plates using DMEM/F12 media containing 10% FBS
lacking phenol red. Cultures were transfected using 200 ng of hSPR
DNA in 10 μL of Opti-MEM mixed with 0.6 μL of PEI in 10
μL of Opti-MEM per well as stated previously. After 47 h of
transfection, appropriate cells were pretreated with 50 μM tranilast
for 1 h. The hSPR activity was measured both extracellularly and intracellularly.
Briefly, the activity of released extracellular hSPR was determined
through the collection of aspirated media from each well. One hundred
microliters of collected media was mixed with an equal volume of the
assay mix containing 1 mM NADPH, 200 μg/mL of BSA, and 300 μM
sepiapterin diluted in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) on
a transparent 96-well plate. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured
at the start of the assay and after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C.
To determine hSPR activity within the cells, intracellular reaction
mix containing 500 μL of phenol-red free media with 1.25 mM
NADPH, 125 μg/mL of BSA, and 150 μM sepiapterin was added
to the transfected cells. Two hundred microlitres of the intracellular
reaction mix was transferred on an empty transparent 96-well plate
after 24 h incubation at 37 °C and the absorbance was measured
at 405 nm. This was run in parallel to assay controls of nontransfected
cells and cultures lacking tranilast treatment to determine percentage
of enzyme inhibition.

Cell Metabolism and Viability Assays
The CellTiter
96 non-radioactive cell proliferation assay was used to measure the
viability of cells, while the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability
assay (both Promega, Madison, USA) was utilized to quantify cellular
ATP, signaling the presence of metabolically active cells. The cultures
of the SH-SY5Y cells were prepared on 96-well transparent assay plates
for the proliferation assay or opaque-walled plates for the viability
assay at 80% confluency in 100 μL of culture medium. The cultures
were subjected to 24 h treatment with a range of tranilast concentrations
(0.1 μM–1 mM). The assays were performed following the
manufacturer’s guidelines. Control wells containing cell-free
media were used to obtain a value for background luminescence and
DMSO vehicle controls.

Flow Cytometry of ROS
For cellular
quantification of
ROS by flow cytometry, the cultures were grown in appropriate media
in 24-well culture plates up to 80% confluency. Culture media was
aspirated and replaced with 500 μL of stimulation media, containing
40 ng of TNF-α (Invitrogen Thermo, Carlsbad, US), and 100 ng
of IFN-γ (Gibco Thermo, Waltham, US) per 1 mL of the appropriate
cell medium. Drug treatments were administered and cells were incubated
for 24 h at 37 °C; nonstimulated and flow cytometry fluorophore-free
assay controls were run in parallel. Stimulation media was aspirated
and 300 μL of the appropriate cell medium lacking phenol red
and FBS, containing 1.25 μM of 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCFDA) (Thermo Scientific Waltham, USA) utilized
for the detection and bio-imaging of ROS, was added to each well.
The plate was incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, protected from light.
The cells were detached using 200 μL of trypsin and resuspended
with 300 μL of PBS containing 10% FBS, before centrifugation
at 1000g for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 500
μL of cold PBS and kept on ice. Cell sample flow cytometry was
performed on a Millipore Guava easyCyte flow cytometry system and
analyzed using the Guava InCyte software (Merck Millipore, Massachusetts,
US), measuring 5000 cells within set gating boundaries to calculate
a median fluorescent output.

Western Blot of BH4 Pathway Enzymes
& qPCR of
Upstream Gene Expressions
For protein quantification, SH-SY5Y
cultures treated for 24 h with 100 μM tranilast or vehicle control
were collected and counted after detachment using trypsin and spun
at 500g for 5 min. One millilitre of radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer per 2 × 107 cells, containing 0.1% v/v
protease inhibitor cocktail (both Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK), was
added to the isolated pellet, mixed, and stored at 4 °C for 20
min. This was then centrifuged at 10 000g for
10 min and the supernatant containing soluble protein stored at −80
°C until further use. The protein sample concentration was determined
through a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
US) performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
using a standard curve generated from series dilution of BSA (Sigma-Aldrich,
Dorset, UK) to quantify the samples against relative absorbance values
at 595 nm. Western immunoblotting was carried out using standard protocols;
10 μg of the protein samples were loaded onto 12% acrylamide
gels with a Precision Plus Protein All Blue prestained protein ladder
and run with a PowerPac Universal power supply at 250 V and 35 mA.
Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were activated by soaking in methanol,
and membrane transfer was performed using a Trans-Blot Turbo transfer
system (all Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, US) at 25 V and 1 A/gel
for 30 min. The blots were blocked in 10 mL of a 1:1 solution of Odyssey
blocking buffer (OBB; Licor, Cambridge, UK) and TBS for 1 h and incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (see Table S2), diluted in a 1:19 solution of OBB and TBS (1:1000
primary antibody dilution). The blots were washed 4 times in TBST
for 10 min before the addition of the secondary antibody dilution
in a 1:19 solution of OBB in TBS (1:2000 secondary antibody dilution)
and left rocking in the dark for 30 min at room temperature before
fluorescent visualization on a ChemiDoc MP visualization system according
to the secondary antibody specific wavelengths (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, US).

Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using
the TRI reagent following the supplier’s protocol and stored
in RNase-free H2O (both Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) at −80
°C. RNA sample concentrations and purity were determined using
UV spectrophotometric quantification on a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific Waltham, USA), and through electrophoresis on a
nondenaturing 1% agarose gel. Reverse transcription of 500 ng of RNA
samples was performed with a Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific
Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
diluting the product to 1:10 in molecular grade RNA/DNA-free H2O and stored at −20 °C for use in qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR
was performed on a CFX96 RT instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
US), using triplicates of the samples in a 10 μL reaction containing
5 μL of diluted cDNA (further 1:5 dilution of the stored cDNA
synthesis product), 300 nM of the forward and reverse primers and
3 μL of iTaq Universal SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, US). The reaction consisted of polymerase activation and
DNA denaturing at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 thermal cycles
of denaturing for 5 s and annealing and extension at 60 °C for
30 s before fluorescence measurement. Following cycle completion,
melt curve analysis was performed and calculation of the threshold
cycle (Cq value) was determined using
a Bio-Rad CFX Manager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, US) to quantify
the gene expression, normalized using actin and GAPDH reference gene
(geNorm M value = 0.451). Forward and reverse primers
(Eurofins Genomics, Wolverhampton, UK) for gene expression are listed
in the Table S3.

BH4 Quantification
by QQQ-MS
Cultures of
SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media on 6-well culture plates
up to 80% confluency. The cells were pretreated with either 30, 100,
or 300 μM tranilast for 1 h to allow for ligand–enzyme
interactions. Media was then replaced with DMEM/F12 media containing
100 μM sepiapterin and the corresponding well concentration
of tranilast. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, with
both nontreated and sepiapterin free control wells running in parallel.
Media was then aspirated, and the cells were detached using 200 μL
of trypsin, mixed with 300 μL PBS, and centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μL
of H2O containing 6.5 mM dithioerythritol and subjected
to needle homogenization through a 22-gauge needle and four freeze–thaw
cycles from dry ice to a heat block at 37 °C. The lysate was
centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min and the
supernatant was collected, filtered through 4 mm, 0.45 μm pore
syringe filters (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK) into amber glass vials
for QQQ-MS analysis.

The instrumentation for BH4 quantification
included an Agilent 1290 Infinity II Series LC and an Agilent 6470
Triple Quadrupole LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
US). High-performance liquid chromatography separation was achieved
at 40 °C, using an Agilent Poroshell 120 C18, 2.7
μm, 4.6 × 100 mm column, and a gradient solvent mixture
consisting of mobile phase A (H2O + 0.1% formic acid) and
mobile phase B (acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid). The gradient used
was 0–2 min 2% B; 12 min 98% B; 14 min 98% B; 14.1 min 2% B;
15 min 2% B. The flow rate was set at 0.6 mL/min, and sample injection
volume at 10 μL. QQQ-MS experiment parameters were as followed:
gas temperature, 300 °C at a flow of 10 mL/min; nebulizer pressure,
20 psi; sheath gas temperature, 350 °C at a flow of 11 mL/min
capillary voltage, 3000 V; nozzle voltage, 500 V; fragmentor voltage,
135 V; cell accelerator voltage, 5 V. The instrument was operated
at positive ion electrospray ionization, and the MS was applied in
the multiple reaction monitoring mode with precursor ion m/z 242.1 and product ion m/z 166.0 using a collision energy of 20 eV. The BH4 standard used for method development and quantification of limit
of detection (Figure S8) was acquired from
Schircks Laboratories, Bauma, Switzerland.

Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as means
± standard error of the mean (SEM) or standard deviation; details
of the statistical tests used are stated in figure legends. The student’s t-test was used to compare between two individual groups,
and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey’s
post-hoc test was used for analysis for multiple comparisons between
multiple groups. In all tests, p ≤ 0.05 was
considered significant.
