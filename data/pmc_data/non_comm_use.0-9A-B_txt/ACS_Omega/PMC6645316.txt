Detection
of bioprocess-interfering metal ions and molecules is
important for healthcare, and peptide single-molecule junctions have
shown their potential toward sensing these targets efficiently. Using
first-principles calculations, we investigate the conductance of Cys-Gly-Cys
and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys peptide junctions, and the effect of its
change upon copper-ion (Cu2+) or bisphenol A (BPA) binding.
The calculated conductance of the peptides and the Cu2+–peptide complexes agrees well with the experimental data
and that of the BPA-bond peptides is further predicted. Our analyses
show that the conductance switching mainly comes from the structure
deformation of the peptide caused by Cu2+ binding or from
the new conduction channel added by BPA binding. Our results suggest
that the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys junction can recognize Cu2+ and BPA better than the Cys-Gly-Cys one does.

Introduction
Sensors built of ensemble1−7 and individual8−10 peptides have shown their potential toward viable,
mobile, and fast-response detection of polarized lights,1 metal ions,2−6,8 molecules,7 and solution pH values,9,10 partially because peptides
present an astronomical number of ligands for binding specific metal
ions11 or molecules,7 and such binding can trigger electric signals in devices
efficiently. Peptides thus offer important recognition for healthcare,
for example, sensing copper ions or bisphenol A [BPA and (CH3)2C(C6H4OH)2] molecules,
as in a high concentration, the copper ions may involve symptoms11 or diseases,12 and
the BPA molecules can affect reproductive systems.13 However, these key potentials can be fully explored only
with a clear understanding of the driving physics.

Measured
single-peptide conductance8 has been simulated14 via a tight-binding
model, claiming that hollow binding sites consist of the contacts.
However, under the stretching process in measurements,8 the top binding sites forming the contacts are recently
suggested.15−17 Using a similar approach, the effects of the changes
in conductance upon Cu- and Ni-ion binding on the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys
peptide have been calculated,18 but the
jump values (ratios of transmission coefficients at their Fermi energy,
−5.2 eV) are orders of magnitude smaller than the measured
data.8 Therefore, although the single-molecule
conductance of alkanedithiolate and benzenedithiolate, for instance,
can be modeled quantitatively from first principles,15,16 such modeling of a single-molecule peptide, particularly in its
switching upon metal-ion binding, is still a challenge. On the other
hand, first-principles studies on cyclic and linear peptides in the
β-strand19,20 and helical20 conformations, and on quinolinedithiol-21 and bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amine-based22 single-molecule junctions for ion detection were reported.
Nevertheless, first-principles modeling of single-peptide junctions
for Cu-ion and BPA identification is still absent.

In this work,
the conduction properties of the Cys-Gly-Cys peptide,
the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys peptide, and their Cu or BPA complexes
are studied from first principles. These peptides possess two thiol
termini in contact with Au electrodes, have shown large conductance
changes upon metal binding in measurements,8 and can form Cu or even BPA complexes. We investigate how to use
these peptides to differentiate the presence of Cu or BPA via conductance
modulation and further unravel its mechanism. Our results agree well
with experimental data8 and provide an
insight for efficient detection of Cu ions and BPA molecules with
the use of single-molecule peptide junctions.

Results and Discussion
We calculate the conduction properties of single-peptide junctions
first. The optimized geometries of Cys-Gly-Cys and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys
peptide junctions are shown in Figure 1a,e, and their lengths from S to S atoms (S–S)
are 11.95 and 15.75 Å, respectively. The calculated conductance
values of Cys-Gly-Cys and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys junctions are 7.40
× 10–6 and 5.36 × 10–7G0, in good agreement with the experimental
data of 5.3 × 10–6 and 5.0 × 10–7G0, respectively8 (see Table 1). The
conductance of the Cys-Gly-Cys peptide is about one order of magnitude
larger than that of the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys one, as their local
density of states (LDOS) at EF, shown
in Figure 1d,h, indicate
that the former has a shorter effective tunneling distance16 than the latter. To further investigate the
conduction characteristics, transmission spectra are calculated and
plotted in Figure 1b,f, showing different shapes around −1.00, −0.40,
and −0.15 eV. The projected density of states (PDOS) on the
peptide and the lead are shown in Figure 1c,g. As expected, the leads have a similar
PDOS for both peptides. However, the PDOS peak around −0.72
eV of the Cys-Gly-Cys peptide is sharper than that around −0.63
eV of the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys one. Comparing the shapes of the
transmission spectra with those of the peptide PDOS indicates that
they are correlated. In general, excluding the localized and symmetry-mismatched
states, the transmission function of a molecule is proportional to
its PDOS.

and local density of states at EF (d,h)

After
the geometries of the Cu2+–peptide complexes
with gold adatoms are optimized in between the leads, transport calculations
are performed, and results are shown in Figure 2a,e. Upon copper-ion binding, the S–S
distances of the Cys-Gly-Cys and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys peptides are
shortened by 12.6 and 13.3%, and their conductance values increase
8.3 and 81.3 times to 6.14 × 10–5 and 4.36
× 10–5G0, as consistent
with the measured data of 2.3 × 10–5 and 1.6
× 10–4G0,8 respectively (Table 1). Therefore, the binding of copper ion to
the peptides can be recognized from electric signals occurring in
these junctions. The conductance values of these two complexes are
similar,  as well as their effective  tunneling
distances, presented by LDOS at EF in Figure 2d,h. However, the
shapes of transmission spectra in Figure 2b,f are different, corresponding to different
PDOS of the Cu2+–peptide complexes in Figure 2c,g. These PDOS curves of the
complexes align with those of the peptides, as the Cu2+ ion is screened after two electrons are donated to the peptide.
The PDOS of complexes is thus mostly contributed by the PDOS of the
peptides rather than that of Cu2+. In addition, when the
copper ion is removed from the complexes (other geometries fixed),
the conductance of Cu2+-removed junctions are 7.48 ×
10–5 and 1.94 × 10–5G0, respectively, which is still close to that
of the Cu2+–peptide ones. Therefore, the conductance
switching upon Cu2+ binding comes from the structure changing.

single-molecule junctions. Optimized structures of (a) Cys-Gly-Cys
+ Cu2+ and (e) cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys + Cu2+ junctions (C, brown; H, white; N, cyan; S, green; Au, gold; Cu,
blue). Their transmission spectra (b,f), PDOS (c,g), and LDOS at EF (d,h) are shown, respectively.

Rather than involving the covalent bond in the
Cu2+–peptide
complexes, the BPA molecule attaches to peptides via hydrogen bonds.
Two hydroxyl groups of BPA, separated by 9.62 Å, bind to nitrogen
and oxygen atoms of the Cys-Gly-Cys peptide and to two oxygen atoms
of the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys peptide, shown in Figure 3a,e, respectively. They form parallel circuits
and lead to quantum interference.19,20,23 Upon BPA binding, the conductance of the Cys-Gly-Cys
+ BPA junction decreases a little to 5.02 × 10–6G0, but that of the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys
+ BPA one increases to 1.38 × 10–5G0 (Table 1). The BPA binding provides a new conduction channel, mostly
through the hydrogen bonds and hydroxyphenyl rings of the BPA molecule,
as LDOS at EF indicates, shown in Figure 3d,h. This channel
governs the junction conductance, causing a similar conductance of
the two BPA-bond peptides. Figure 3b,f shows the transmission spectra of Cys-Gly-Cys +
BPA and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys + BPA junctions, respectively, which
are dominated by the PDOS of the complexes, plotted in Figure 3c,g. Although the PDOS of the
complexes is similar with that of the peptides, two peaks around −0.02
and −0.36 eV align with those of BPA. The former peak dominates
the LDOS at EF and thus the junction conductance.
When BPA molecules are removed from these geometries, the conductance
of the BPA-removed Cys-Gly-Cys (cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys) junction,
2.51 × 10–6 (8.0 × 10–7) G0, is a little smaller (higher) than
the peptide one, 7.40 × 10–6 (5.36 × 10–7) G0, because of the slight
deformation of the peptide caused by BPA binding. Overall, the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys
junction can detect both Cu2+ and BPA well, whereas the
Cys-Gly-Cys junction can only distinguish Cu2+.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigate
the electron transmission spectra of
Cys-Gly-Cys and cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys peptide junctions, and their
change upon Cu2+ or BPA binding from first principles.
We first compare the calculated results for detecting the Cu ion with
the previous experimental work,8 bridging
the long-standing gaps between theory and experiment. Next, we employ
the same approach to make predictions about detecting the BPA molecule.
For both the cases, Cu and BPA, there is a more significant change
in the conductance of the junction with the cysteamine-Gly-Gly-Cys
peptide than with the Cys-Gly-Cys peptide. We computationally show
that the former peptide can act as sensors for both the copper ion
and the BPA molecule via conductance modulation. Our results would
promote further research in the field of sensing with the use of molecular
electronics.

Computational Details
As the gold
tip of a scanning probe microscope is retracted from
the molecule, the gold nanowires along with the atomic contact form
at the ends of the molecule,17 building
the single-molecule junction.8,9 Therefore, the peptide
junction consisted of three parts: the left electrode, the right electrode,
and the scattering region (Figure 1a). Gold electrodes with unit cells repeating along
the [001] direction were used.15,16 The scattering region
included layers of electrode as buffer regions bonded through gold
adatoms to a single peptide in between. The molecule, its complex,
and two gold adatoms were fully relaxed by a SIESTA package,24 based on density functional theory (DFT), whereas
the other gold atoms were kept fixed at the experimental lattice constant
of 4.08 Å. The quantum transport properties were calculated by
a Nanodcal package,25,26 based on DFT and nonequilibrium
Green’s function framework. Both calculations used pseudopotentials
and the double-ζ plus polarization basis set, within the local
density approximation. The Brillouin zone was sampled by 100 k-points. In the linear response regime, the conductance, G = T(EF)G0, with T being the transmission
spectrum, EF being the Fermi energy, set
to 0 eV, and G0 = 2e2/h being the quantum of conductance.
