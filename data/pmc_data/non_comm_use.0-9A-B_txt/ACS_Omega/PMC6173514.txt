Organic solvent nanofiltration
(OSN) membranes are always troubled by the “trade-off”
effect between solvent flux and solute rejection. Hence, a rapid,
convenient, and effective way to synthesize novel β-cyclodextrin-enhanced
zeolite imidazole framework-8 (β-CD@ZIF-8) nanoparticles was
first proposed and the nanoparticles were doped into both selective
layer and poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) support
for fabricating thin-film nanocomposite membranes. Transmission/scanning
electron microscopy images and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results
demonstrate the successful synthesis of β-CD@ZIF-8. Atomic force
microscopy images illustrate the more rougher surface compared to
the pristine membrane, while the pure acetone flux reached 62.3 ±
2.3 L m–2 h–1, and Rose Bengal
rejection achieved 96.6 ± 1.8 and 94.5 ± 0.5% in methanol
(MeOH) and tetrahydrofuran at 0.6 MPa, respectively, when the dosage
was 0.05% (w/v). The
molecular weight cutoff around 574 Da of PPA2505 containing β-CD@ZIF-8
in both support and selective layers shows the optimum properties
and outstanding OSN performances in erythromycin concentration and
purification in MeOH and butyl acetate. Additionally, polyimide nanofiber
and the formed net structure may offer a potential way to fabricate
“ultrathin” film in the OSN industry.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ultrafast molecular separation
(UMS) is an emerging notion in highly selective membranes with pore
size in the range of 0.5–5 nm, which consumes low energy while
maintaining efficiency. One of the most important factors to develop
UMS membranes is combining the state-of-the-art nanomaterials with
advanced membrane material during preparation.1

There is one kind of green technology known as organic solvent
nanofiltration (OSN) (Table S1 abbreviations)
which finds applications in pharmaceutical ingredient recovery, dye
rejection, catalyst recycling, food processing, and oil production.2−7 Over the last
decade, the OSN membranes had been widely prepared by adopting polyimide
(PI) (P84 or Matrimid 5218) by nonsolvent induced phase separation
(NIPS) method, followed by IP reaction to prepare thin-film composite
(TFC)/N membranes.8,9 During the preparation process,
they were always cross-linked by different types of diamine. Shao
et al. found that the diamine cross-linking reactivity was affected
by the molecular lengths and nucleophilicity and the shorter molecular
length may have the better effect. Moreover, different solvents would
interact membranes differently, although the cross-linked OSN membrane
has better stability, and the solvent permeance would be reduced due
to phenomena like compact effect and cross-linker–membrane
interaction.10 Changelessly, the development
of OSN membranes is aimed at reducing the “trade-off”
effect between solvent flux and solute rejection, while maintain high
resistance to organic solvents.11

A novel process to fabricate OSN membrane, which breaks the traditional
method, was presented using advanced PI electrospinning nanofiber
as solvent-resistant support. The ultrafine nanofiber (∼33
μm) contains homogeneous pores with a nominal size of 1.273
μm and high porosity, which reduce the mass-transfer resistance
during operation.12,13

Poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA) is a kind of aromatic polyamide
(PA) material, which has several merits for membrane fabrication,
such as its hydrophilic nature, high porosity, splendid mechanical
properties, and operability (Figure S1).14 Zhu et al. claimed that membranes prepared via
PMIA could break through the trade-off effect between permeance and
rejection, while Bruggen et al. developed an mixed matrix membrane
(MMM) with it for the first time through combination with MIL-53(Al)
and demonstrated its great potential in OSN performances.15,16

Compared to MIL-53(Al) and other metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs), zeolite imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) is a group of prevailing
porous materials with exceptional thermal and chemical stabilities,
which play an important role in gas separation, catalyst, and building
ultrathin ZIF-8 membranes.17−21 With
an sodalite (SOD) zeolite-type structure consisting of small apertures
(3.4 Å), large pores (11.6 Å), and cubic space group (16.32
Å), ZIF-8 were always welcomed in OSN applications.22 Besides, β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) found
its capacity in TFC OSN membrane preparation and organic pollutants
removal due to both its hollow truncated cone structure and well-arranged
hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity distribution.23−25

Herein, novel β-CD-enhanced
ZIF-8 (β-CD@ZIF-8) nanoparticles were first synthesized through
a simple method and incorporated into the PA selective layer. The
two PA layers were a PMIA support layer and a PA selective layer.
The PMIA support layer was formed onto the PI nanofiber by spin coating
of PMIA (without diamine cross-linking) with a spinner (Laurell model
WS-650MZ-23NPPB) and IP between m-phenylenediamine
(MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) with the improvement of β-CD@ZIF-8.
The structure of the as-prepared thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membrane
is schematically shown in Table of Contents.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemical Compositions
Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of β-CD, ZIF-8, and β-CD@ZIF-8
are displayed in Figure 2a. According to the references elsewhere, characteristic peaks at
689–756, 1171, 1588, and 2920 cm–1 attributed
to the ZIF-8 particle could be clearly determined. Meanwhile, vibrations
of primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols in the β-CD structure
could also be observed.26,27 After the synthesis
of β-CD@ZIF-8, the structure and the characteristic peaks were
still retained, while those vibrations of alcohols were covered by
the strong peaks of ZIF-8. These results indicated the successful
synthesis of β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles with both the merits of
β-CD and ZIF-8 particles.

XRD patterns of β-CD,
ZIF-8, and β-CD@ZIF-8 are displayed in Figure 2c. Likewise, the same conclusion could be
acquired as the FT-IR analysis, in which the obtained patterns illuminate
the characteristic peaks (in rectangle) of ZIF-8 and have never changed
after being enhanced by β-CD. Some peaks attributed to β-CD
overlapped with those of ZIF-8 and showed the strengthened peaks in
the β-CD@ZIF-8 pattern.

With respect to the TFN OSN membranes
with or without β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, all of them exhibited
a typical spectrum style of the MPD-TMC PA layer, while the influences
of the nanoparticles could be defined conspicuously in terms of their
hydroxyl vibration strength. In Figure 2b, we could clearly observe “C–O–C”
at 1339 and 1418 cm–1, which are attributed to the
ester group formed between the hydroxyl group of β-CD@ZIF-8
and TMC (inset). According to the reference, the peaks have some shifting
mainly due to the low content and testing conditions such as testing
temperature, humidity, and instrumental differences.28 Furthermore, we judged the hydroxyl vibration strength
of each membrane by a simple “dash dot line” tool. The
PI nanofiber shows the highest hydrophobicity among all related membranes,
while the membrane with PMIA support shows hydroxyl vibration strength
of four dots indicating the excellent hydrophilicity of the PMIA nature
for IP reaction. After the PA selective layer was established, the
surface hydrophilicity decreased and the hydroxyl vibration strength
reduced to only two dots. With the introduction of the β-CD@ZIF-8
nanoparticles, PPA05 owns four dots, which equaled to PMIA. As β-CD@ZIF-8
dosage increased in the PA selective layer, more hydroxyl groups in
the β-CD@ZIF-8 structure dispersed onto/into the PA layer and
reacted (Figure 1b),
leading to the improvement of surface hydrophilicity, and the number
of dots finally reached up to 7.

process. (b) Ideal reaction mechanism during PA selective layer formation
stage.

XPS analysis was carried out
to further determine the chemical composition of the as-developed
β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles and the TFN membranes. The wide-scan
spectra and atomic percentages of the samples are shown in Figure 2d. Pure ZIF-8 shows rarely oxygen element content (0.01%)
compared to β-CD@ZIF-8 (3.91%), which was successfully wrapped
by β-CD. Meanwhile, TFC membrane PPA prepared without doping
β-CD@ZIF-8 exhibited no zinc element, while TFN membrane PPA10
(4.87%) contains more zinc than PPA05 (4.33%), in accordance with
the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) results (Table 2). Detailed information about the TFC/N membranes’
high-resolution C 1s spectra is shown in Figure S2.

spectroscopy (XPS) wide-scan images of PPA, PPA05, and PPA10 (inset:

and β-CD@ZIF-8).

2.2 Morphology
and Topography
From the inset of Figure 3, it could be observed that the morphology
of the ZIF-8 particle transformed from SOD structure to a ball shape
after wrapped by β-CD accompanied with the enlargement of the
mean particle size from 65.5 ± 15.4 to 87.1 ± 10.7 nm. Particle
size distribution curves also show differences between pure ZIF-8
and β-CD@ZIF-8, where the latter distributes in a larger region,
while the former distributes in a smaller region. The changes of the
particle sizes is the result of wrapping of β-CD onto the ZIF-8
nanoparticles during the preparing process. We could also observe
these phenomena from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
evidently. Figure 4a,e displays a typically SOD structure and a ball shape of ZIF-8
and β-CD@ZIF-8 clearer than Figure 3a,b. Their sizes obtained from the images
were around 51 and 82 nm, in the range of their particle size distribution
curves. Comparing Figure 4b,c and 4f,b, enlarged particles and
those “wrapping β-CD” organizations could be determined
distinctly on the structure of β-CD@ZIF-8 in contrast to those
of pure ZIF-8. Besides, β-CD@ZIF-8 displays more a homogeneous
dispersion compared to pure ZIF-8 (Figure 4d,h). In addition, ζ ζ potential
values of pure ZIF-8 and β-CD@ZIF-8 in deionized (DI) water
0.1% (w/v) were determined to be 19.9 ± 0.2 and 27.2 ± 0.2
mV. The differences of ζ potential values must be another evidence
that β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles were synthesized successfully.
According to literature reports, the ball-shaped particles always
have less surface energy and better dispersibility, and the properties
of ZIF-8 has never changed, but may give this kind of nanomaterial
the potential in the OSN membranes (Figure 2a,c).29

Researchers in the membrane field know very well the importance of
the dispersibility of a new material during the preparation process
and that more hydrophilous material has better dispersibility. Figure 5a lists the powder
water contact angle results of ZIF-8 and β-CD@ZIF-8, while the
β-CD and β-CD, ZIF-8 mixture (molar ratio 1:1) was also
prepared as control. Pure ZIF-8 powder possesses the highest water
contact angle of 74.5° and hardly changed in 60 s test, while
the compacted pure β-CD powder could not support the water droplet
in a very short time due to its soluble nature. The β-CD and
ZIF-8 mixture shows improved hydrophilicity than pure ZIF-8, but still
could not surpass that of β-CD@ZIF-8, where the water droplet
was vanished in 20 s. In addition, the variation trends could also
prove the successful synthesis of β-CD@ZIF-8 with the exception
of the instrumental analysis discussed above. Figure 5b illustrates the dispersion conditions of
0.1% (w/v) ZIF-8 and β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles in DI, EtOH, and n-hexane. β-CD@ZIF-8 in DI water looks more transparent
than ZIF-8 due to the presence of soluble β-CD wrapped around
the particle, which endowed better hydrophilicity and even give the
wrapped particles solubility. In EtOH, two particles display almost
the same dispersibility, while two distinct results appeared in n-hexane. The better dispersion of β-CD@ZIF-8 in n-hexane guides us to introduce the particles into the organic
phase to fabricate novel TFC OSN membranes.

mixture; (b) comparison of dispersibilities of ZIF-8 (white cap) and
β-CD@ZIF-8 (black cap) in DI water, EtOH, and n-hexane.

The PMIA support
always appeared to be a spongelike structure mixed with macropores,
which endow the OSN membrane with excellent mechanical strength and
high permeability (Figure 6a). With better surface hydrophilicity (Figure 10b), the PA selective layer
could be easily formed onto the PMIA support (Figure 6b,c). After we incorporated specific contents
of β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles into the organic phase, the hydrophilicity
of the as-formed PA layer changed as we expected. As shown in Figure 10b, the water contact
angle shows the order of PPA10 < PPA05 < PPA. The decreased
contact angle values were affected by these aspects. Adding fillers
in the monomer solutions may vary the cross-linking degree of the
formed PA selective layer and then vary the surface hydrophilicity
of the membrane surface.30 The presence
of the hydroxyl wrapped outside the modified ZIF-8 nanoparticles and
with dosage increase, the nanoparticles on the PA layer increases,
further lowering the water contact angle. As we have dispersed the
hydrophilic β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles into hydrophobic TMC/n-hexane solution, which strongly affects the interfacial
polymerization due to the reaction between hydroxyl and acyl chloride,
the C–O–C and MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure
was formed. Besides, hydrophilic nanoparticles in TMC/n-hexane solution would deposit them on the upper part of PA layer,
which made them to exert their hydrophilicity nature more easily.
These were also clearly reflected by the EDX and XPS results shown
in Figure 6d and Table 1: the percentage of
zinc atom increased remarkably as the increased dosage of β-CD@ZIF-8.
Moreover, from the FT-IR spectra shown in the vibration between wavelengths
3100 and 3600 cm–1, PPA10 also becomes stronger
than PPA05 (Figure 2b), in accordance with the results. Evidently, reacted β-CD@ZIF-8
nanoparticles could be easily found on the membrane surface (Figure 6f–h), which
is confirmed by the C–O–C vibration and resulted in
the increment of surface roughness (Figure 2b and Table 2). Comparing Figure 6e and 6d, intensive peaks and a gully could be observed after doping
the particles, and these structures would directly affect the solvent
permeance. First, more effective membrane area could be used to receive
the incoming feed solvent, and the solvent molecule could go through
either β-CD@ZIF-8 cavities or the dense PA layer. Then, with
better hydrophilicity of both the PA layer and the PMIA support, most
of the solvent molecules would pass through the OSN membrane matrix
rapidly and thus improve the permeance and separation efficiency of
the membrane. Figure 6i reveals the overall cross-sectional perspective of PPA, which could
be a typical example of the as-prepared OSN membranes. This series
of OSN membrane consists of three layers, including PI nanofiber,
PMIA support membrane, and PA selective layer. The electrospun PI
shows a homogeneous thickness of 33 ± 1 μm, which supply
the solvent-resistant backbone for the membrane and has the potential
in preparing ultrathin OSN membranes. The bulk part is the PMIA support
membrane formed by spin-coating technique and NIPS method, which shows
a thickness of 85 ± 5 μm, and the thinnest layer is the
PA selective layer, which was prepared via IP method. The PMIA support
membrane and the PA selective layer with or without β-CD@ZIF-8
were developed to investigate their OSN performances. Those TFN OSN
membranes containing 0.05% (w/v) β-CD@ZIF-8 show a thicker selective
layer (102.1 ± 4.0 nm) than TFC membranes (97.1 ± 6.4 nm)
due to the introduction of nanoparticles and the increased surface
roughness. Moreover, the reacted β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, which
formed the MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure, also integrated
in the selective layer and give the TFN membrane additional OSN performances.

2.3 OSN Performances
The PI nanofiber has the pure MeOH flux just equal to the feed
speed at a relatively low cross-membrane pressure due to its homogeneous
and a rather larger nominal pore size (1.273 μm). The PMIA support
membrane was thus developed to control the solvent flux based on the
concentration of PMIA in spinning solution. PMIA with concentration
from 17.0 to 20.0 wt % were spin-coated and tested in pure MeOH and
tetrahydrofuran (THF) under both 0.2 and 0.6 MPa. As shown in Figure 7a,b, the PMIA support
membrane prepared by 18.0 wt % spinning solution is the most suitable
support to further fabricate β-CD@ZIF-8-doped TFN OSN membrane
because the quality of the IP reaction strongly depends on the properties
of the support. The fluxes of MeOH and THF show the same variation
trend with increase of the spinning solution concentration. However,
the TFC membrane prepared by 17.0 wt % would have much higher solvent
flux but lower solute rejection, while that prepared by 19.0 and 20
wt % would have extremely high solute rejection but almost no solvent
flux. Therefore, we doped β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles into the
18.0 wt % PMIA spinning solution and prepared PA25 support in which
improved permeance performances were obtained and further developed
PPA2505 TFN OSN membrane.

ZIF-8, pure β-CD, β-CD, ZIF-8 mixture (molar ratio 1:1)
and β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PA selective layer: (c) Rose Bengal (RB)/MeOH;
(d) RB/THF.

Control tests of PPA OSN membranes
with 0.05% (w/v) pure ZIF-8, pure β-CD, β-CD, ZIF-8 mixture
(molar ratio 1:1), and β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PA selective layer
were also carried out for illustrating the improvement effect of β-CD@ZIF-8
on the OSN performances. Comparing the results in Figure 7c,d, control tests show almost
the same trend in RB/MeOH and RB/THF. TMC/n-hexane
contains pure β-CD, which has the highest flux but the lowest
RB rejection, with the reaction between hydroxyl and acyl chloride
reducing the concentration of TMC and thus forming the less dense
PA selective layer. The fluxes of PPA-containing mixture are acceptable,
but their application in OSN membrane is still hindered by the low
RB rejection induced by the large amounts of β-CD. For those
membrane containing pure ZIF-8, a high RB rejection was achieved,
but they still left behind the PPA membrane containing β-CD@ZIF-8,
in which the formed MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure offers
better hydrophilicity and extra dense layer for preventing those RB
solutes from penetrating the membrane surface and thus reducing the
trade-off effect in a novel way.

The solute selectivity was
mainly dominated by the PA selective layer, and their performances
were demonstrated by the dye/MeOH and dye/THF solvent system. Detailed
results are plotted in Figure 8a,b and their insets. The as-prepared TFN OSN membranes exhibited
excellent solvent-resistant properties for they could operate in a
wide range of polar (a)protic solvents, including harsh solvents such
as acetone and dimethylformamide (DMF). Same moderating trend could
be observed from all prepared TFN OSN membranes. Besides the Hanson
solubility effect, those mechanisms manipulating the pure polar protic
solvent flux order of MeOH > EtOH > n-PrOH
> isopropyl alcohol (IPA) are the outcomes of the influence of
the molecular weight and the steric hindrance effect. Under the same
transmembrane pressure, low-molecule-weight solvents have less mass
transfer resistance to pass through membrane matrix (mainly the PA
selective layer), while longer carbon chains may offer supererogatory
structural resistance. IPA passes slower than n-PrOH,
due to the secondary hydroxyl groups in its structure, which induces
less hydrophilicity than n-PrOH (primary hydroxyl
group). The PPA without incorporation of β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles
reveals the lowest pure flux of both protic and aprotic solvents.
After introduction of the nanoparticles in the PA selective layer,
pure fluxes of all solvents improved and higher loadings seem to show
better performances. The characterization of β-CD (hydrophobic
inner surface)-wrapped ZIF-8 nanoparticles was firm and offers better
dispersibility (hydrophilous external surface) when preparing the
reaction solution before IP treatment. β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PA
selective layer faces the solvents when operating, the surface hydrophilicity
improved due to the existence of β-CD, and additional ducts
were established due to the function of ZIF-8 nanoparticles. These
events could strengthen the solvent permeance of the OSN membranes.
Besides, ZIF-8 itself has reported outstanding performances in OSN
membrane due to its properties.31 Dye/MeOH
and dye/THF performances could also find influences of the β-CD@ZIF-8
nanoparticles. With the addition of the particles, except for RB/THF,
methylene blue (MB), crystal violet (CV), and RB in MeOH and CV/THF,
all showed increased dye solute rejection with the increment of the
solvent, and the schematic of the ideal mechanism is shown in Figure 1b. Abnormal phenomena
occurred in the dye/solvent performances, which were higher than those
of the corresponding pure solvent, especially in CV/MeOH and MB/MeOH
with β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles in the PA selective layer. These
could be attributed to the following reasons. First, solvent filtration
systems are very different from aqueous filtration systems. In the
latter, the flux of pure water is always larger than the solute and
drives the concept of flux recovery (rate) performance because the
solute is usually attached onto the membrane surface due to concentration
polarization and further results in the growth of bacteria and microorganisms,
which would reduce the separation efficiency. However, solvent filtration
systems would seldom face the problem of microorganism contamination
due to their toxicity and harsh environment. Then, those smaller dye
molecules (CV, MB) cause more obvious phenomena. When operating at
high pressure, smaller molecules can be easily pushed into the PA
selective layer and leave the imprintings (most of them could not
really penetrate the dense PA selective layer), which finally improve
the dye/solution permeances. Foremost among these is the swelling
effect of the solvent on the membrane, which may manipulate the OSN
performance. Those membranes were tested with pure solvent flux first,
followed by measuring the dye/solvent performance. Thus, more operating
time was required for the sample membrane, and the small molecular
part of the PMIA support was dissolved, just as the effect of “DMF
activation”. Moreover, β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PA selective
layer may enhance the permeance of the TFN membrane, which let more
solvent pass through the membrane matrix and thus the effect of “solvent
activation” enlarged and eventually give those TFN OSN membranes
higher flux than the pure solvent. Furthermore, due to the presence
of β-CD@ZIF-8 and the formed MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure
by the reaction between hydroxyl and acyl chloride, this net structure
was the strategic point for reducing the serious trade-off effect.
Therefore, when the dye/solvent flux increases, the solute rejection
does not reduce any more.

Figure 8 (a) Pure polar
protic solvent flux and dye/MeOH permeance vs rejection performances
(insets). (b) Pure polar aprotic solvent flux and dye/THF permeance
vs rejection performances (insets). (Specifications of all solvents
and solutes used in this work are displayed in Tables S2 and S3.)

Figure 9a shows the OSN performances (RB/solvent separation)
of PPA2505 membrane with β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles in both layers.
Similar RB rejection values were achieved (96.2 ± 1.6% of RB/MeOH,
95.0 ± 1.1% of RB/THF) compared to PPA05 (96.6 ± 1.8% of
RB/MeOH, 94.5 ± 0.5% of RB/THF), while the polar aprotic solvent
flux was approximately quadrupled (30.7 ± 1.1 L m–2 h–1 compared to 8.2 ± 0.3 L m–2 h–1). The enhancement could be confirmed by the
influence of additional β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles in the PMIA
support compared to PPA05 or PPA10. From one aspect, the introduction
of nanoparticles not only eliminated the macroporous structure but
also strengthened the permeability of PMIA support membrane, which
could be clearly observed in Figure 10a. The properties
of the support may significantly affect the performances of TFC/N
membrane.32 In other aspect, as shown in Figure 10b, PA with additional
0.25 wt % β-CD@ZIF-8 (PA25) shows lower water contact angle
values than PA and it is the lowest among all mentioned membranes
in this work. All of these resulted in reducing the mass transfer
resistances when operating with solvents. Moreover, when IP reaction
took place, the β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PMIA support would also participate
in the reaction and the formation of MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net
structure, which offers extra OSN performance for separation of solute
from the solvent. Furthermore, compared to the surface morphologies
of PPA, PPA2505, and PPA05 (Figure 7b–d), no particle could be found on the surface
of PPA, while particle agglomeration could be observed on PPA05. However, Figure 7e exhibits the uniformly
dispersed particles on the surface of PPA2505, the better dispersibility
of which in β-CD@ZIF-8 aids itself in the first PA layer dominated
by these enhanced OSN performances.

angle (DCA) curves.

Upon all of these OSN performances
discussed above, Figure 10a compared all membrane prepared in this work with pure MeOH
flux, in which the differences could be figured out intuitively. The
PI support has the highest MeOH flux in MF scale, PA was a little
lower than PA25 with β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, while the order
PPA < PPA05 < PPA10 was mainly dominated by its dosage. The
performance of PPA2505 was induced by not only the nanoparticles but
also the integrated MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure.

Swelling behavior measurement results of the as-prepared β-CD@ZIF-8-doped
TFN OSN membrane are listed in Figure 11. As the dosage of β-CD@ZIF-8 in the
PA selective layer increases, the area swelling ratios decrease remarkably.
These were benefited from the formed MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net
structure discussed above. The integrated net structure strengthened
the PA selective layer and PMIA support membrane from swelling like
a reinforcement plate. PPA2505 with nanoparticles in the support formed
a denser MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net than other TFN membranes, showing
best antiswelling performance. Meanwhile, solvent uptake ratios display
approximately the same variation tendency with area swelling ratios.
However, as PMIA support may become weak in the DMF steam and small
molecular part would dissolve gradually, the solvent uptake ratios
were all very small due to the weight loss of PMIA except for PI nanofiber
with excellent solvent-resistant properties. Nevertheless, higher
dosage of nanoparticles could still offer more anti-DMF performance
to the TFN membranes. In fact, PMIA support could sustain in almost
all of the solvents and perform well, but become weak in the DMF steam.
Luckily, this “drawback” of PMIA offers the as-prepared
TFN membrane a potential way to become an “ultrathin”
solvent-resistant film with only PI nanofiber and MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8
net integrated PA selective layer.

uptake ratio of the as-prepared OSN membrane in different solvents;

in different solvents.

The mechanical properties
of the β-CD@ZIF-8-doped TFN OSN membranes and their supports
are shown in Table 3. As we excepted, after PMIA was spin-coated onto the PI nanofiber,
their mechanical properties were improved obviously compared to the
free-standing PMIA support membrane. The introduction of β-CD@ZIF-8
nanoparticles in the PMIA support improved the mechanical properties
of pure PMIA due to their influences during the solvent–water
exchange process (phase separation process) and enhanced the structure
of the support.33,34 Moreover, the excellent mechanical
properties of PI nanofiber accompanied with nanoparticles would offer
a potential way for fabricating PI–PA ultrathin solvent-resistant
film for high-performance OSN application.

With the introduction
of β-CD@ZIF-8 and the formation of the MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8
net structure, the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) decreased sharply
according to the poly(propylene glycol) (PPG) oligomers method (Figure 12a). The bulk structure
usually exhibits higher rejection than the linear structure, while
the chainlike structure of tripropylene glycol (192 Da) has lower
rejection values than those of PPG oligomers, which were bulk structures,
but showed a very high rejection due to the solute adsorption phenomenon.35 Thus, the MWCO values below 192 and 250 Da are
shown by dashed lines instead of abnormal value. For PPGs, the MWCO
value seems larger than 800 Da, which were induced by the swelling
effect of PPGs on PMIA, whose structure was similar to PEGs and results
in the deformation of PMIA structure (Figure S3). Therefore, neutral organic solute in aqueous solution without
swelling effect were adopted to determine the actual MWCO. The obtained
results show the narrower distribution trend and smaller pores of
PPA2505 compared to PPA05 as the MWCO value of PPA2505 (574 Da) is
smaller than that of PPA05 (646 Da) due to the MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8
net structure, which were fit for the concentration and purification
of erythromycin (EM) (733.93 Da).

Figure 12 (a) MWCO vs rejection curves determined by
PPG method
and pore size distribution accompanied with cumulative distribution
curves of PPA05 and PPA2505 (insets). (b) EM/solvent concentration
and purification performances.

Figure 12b concludes the performances of the as-prepared
β-CD@ZIF-8-doped TFN OSN membranes in EM concentration application.
A high concentration and a high efficiency of purification of EM/solvent
could be reached with the as-proposed β-CD@ZIF-8-doped TFN OSN
membrane. The application of the membrane in the EM/polar protic solvent
successfully avoided the trade-off effect and reduced the influence
of concentration polarization phenomenon depending on the hydrophilic
membrane surface. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time
to simulate the EM production environment by using butyl acetate (BA)
and operate EM/BA solution directly with membrane process. With higher
viscosity (0.685 mPa s, 25 °C), higher molecular weight (116.16
g mol–1), and more steric hindrance effect compared
to MeOH (0.545 mPa s, 32.04 g mol–1), the EM/BA
permeance could not catch up to the such high EM/MeOH solution, but
obtained a high rejection value of EM. From the results, we can found
that the PPA displays the highest EM/BA flux among all tested samples,
which was mainly ascribed to the worse solvent-resistant properties
of PPA than those containing β-CD@ZIF-8, its lowest EM rejection
value could not meet the industry requirements. With the introduction
of β-CD@ZIF-8 into the PA selective layer, the solvent-resistance
properties improved greatly, and the as-prepared TFN membrane could
be sustained in the BA environment and offer a high rejection value.
As the dosage of nanoparticles increases, the TFN membrane shows increased
EM/MeOH flux, while the flux of EM/BA decreased. This was induced
by the formation of MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net structure in the
PA selective layer. It is a kind of net structure formed based on
the MPD-TMC structure with more hydrophilic character, but it is more
denser than the MPD-TMC structure. Smaller and polar MeOH molecules
could pass easier than bigger BA molecules and obstruct more EM molecules
to penetrate through it. PPA2505 contains nanoparticles in both PMIA
support and PA selective layers, which shows optimum performances
in EM concentration due to its denser MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8 net
structure, which offers a feasible way for high-purity EM production
compared to the conventional high-cost, time-consuming extraction
process.

2.4 DMF Long-Term
Operation
Figure 13 shows the DMF long-term operation results of PPA, PPA05,
and PPA2505 in DMF steam. The PPA membrane was tested for only 6 h
to figure out the PMIA support dissolving behavior. It is no doubt
that PMIA membrane would be dissolved in the DMF steam gradually due
to the breakage of hydrogen bonds and small chain fractured during
the spinning solution preparation step by using strong solvent dimethylacetamide
(DMAc) at high temperature.36 However,
this drawback could eventually offer the as-prepared TFC/N OSN membranes
a potential way to become an PI–PA ultrathin selective film
with only a solvent-resistant PI nanofiber and a dense PA layer with
high selectivity and stability. The PI nanofiber itself could hardly
form a uniform PA selective layer easily because of its superhydrophobic
(Figure 10b) and huge
mean pore size (1.273 μm).

Figure 13 Results of DMF long-term
operating and the OSN performance
of RB/DMF rejection.

Three OSN membranes show different
behaviors when facing DMF. The “starting fluxes” of
DMF are at a very low level of all three OSN membranes, which were
in accordance with the pure DMF flux reported in Figure 8b, and follow the order PPA
< PPA05 < PPA2505. These are the function of β-CD@ZIF-8
in the PMIA support membrane and the selective layer, which enhanced
the solvent permeance obviously. During this period, the PMIA support
membranes of all three tested samples began dissolving (0.0–1.0
h), with the PMIA support of PPA without any β-CD@ZIF-8 dissolving
the fastest, and its pure DMF flux reaches the DMF flux of PPA2505.
PPA05 with 0.05% (w/v) β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PA selective layer
shows a compact phenomenon instead of dissolving directly at first,
which proves the enhanced solvent-resistant properties. Thus, we can
also speculate PPA2505 with β-CD@ZIF-8 in both PMIA support
and PA selective layer, the same phenomenon as PPA05, but the modification
effects of the nanoparticles cover the compact phenomenon of PPA2505.
Then, when the low-molecular-weight part of the PMIA support of PPA
dissolved completely, the compact phenomenon appeared (1.5 h). At
the same time, PPA05 and PPA2505 could not discover the compact phenomenon
any longer (1.0–2.5 h) and reach a steady state (2.5–5.0
h). However, PPA was facing the “swell effect” of the
high-molecular-weight part of the PMIA support (4.0–4.5 h),
the DMF flux was lifted again and kept steady till the end (4.5–6.0
h), the 35 μM RB/DMF was pumped, and the RB rejection was calculated
to verify the OSN performance. PPA05 and PPA2505 would follow the
same procedure after 12 h operation. In the period of 5.5–7.0
h, PPA05 and PPA2505 also face the swell effect, but with the help
of β-CD@ZIF-8, they sustained more time than PPA. Comparing
their performances, at the phase of 7.0–12.0 h, PPA2505 exhibited
much more steady and higher DMF flux than PPA05, which could benefit
from the additional β-CD@ZIF-8 in the PMIA support that PPA05
guiltless. The insets illustrate the feature of tested samples after
pure DMF operating and RB/DMF testing, the high-molecular-weight part
of the PMIA support could still be observed, while PPA05 and PPA2505
exhibit corrugated topography due to the presence of the nanoparticles,
which endowed them high roughness (Figure 6d,e). RB/DMF rejection results displayed
in the right-hand side of Figure 13 could demonstrate the fact that PMIA support dissolving
in the DMF steam has almost no influence on the OSN performances of
the as-prepared β-CD@ZIF-8 TFN OSN membranes.

Table 4 displays the OSN
performances of other recent research works. The as-prepared β-CD@ZIF-8-doped
TFN OSN membranes are full of competence to meet the requirements
of OSN industry.

a Due to the variety of solvent performances of OSN membranes, the

references, which included the most prominent solvent flux (reflected
under 1 bar) and RB rejection effect (RB in low-molecular-weight solvent
is the priority, such as in MeOH, EtOH and then in n-PrOH, IPA, etc.).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed
novel TFN OSN membranes with doping β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles
also proposed by us first. The membrane exhibits a traditional support
membrane, a PA selective layer, and an integrated MPD-TMC-β-CD@ZIF-8
net structure for outstanding OSN performances and offers an efficient
way for EM concentration and purification. The membrane performance
could be further improved through adjusting PMIA support membrane
concentration, balancing the contents of aqueous and organic phases,
optimizing the dosage of β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, or post-treating
with a mixed polar aprotic solvent, which we would discuss in our
future work.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Agentia and
Reagents
PMIA was bought from Dupont. PI nanofiber (average
pore size, 1.273 μm) was fabricated in our laboratory. Briefly,
polyamide acid nanofiber was electrospun by using PAA solution, followed
by heat dehydration.43 PAA solution was
purchased from Changzhou Furun Special Plastic New Materials Co.,
Ltd. TMC was acquired from Qingdao Benzo Chemical Company (China).
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, LiCl, and solvents
used in this work include MeOH, EtOH, n-PrOH, IPA, n-BuOH, THF, AcOEt, acetone, DMF, DMAc, BA, and n-hexane, which were procured from Shanghai Titanchem Co.,
Ltd., while MeCN (high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade)
was obtained from Acros Organics. HmIM (98%), MPD (99%), β-CD
(99%+), EM (98%+), tripropylene glycol (99%), glucose, sucrose, and
raffinose were bought from Adamas-β. PPG (Mw = 425, 725, 1000 g mol–1) and RB (Mw = 1017.64 g mol–1) were
labeled Sigma-Aldrich. CV (Mw = 407.98
g mol–1, AR) and MB (Mw = 799.80 g mol–1, BS) were fabricated by Shanghai
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All reagents were of reagent grade unless
otherwise mentioned.

4.2 β-CD@ZIF-8 Preparation
The as-proposed β-CD@ZIF-8
nanoparticles were first prepared in a simple and effective way in
our laboratory. The schematic diagram of the β-CD@ZIF-8 preparation
process is shown in Figure 1a. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (4.0
mmol) and HmIM (280.0 mmol) were fully dissolved in 8.0 and 80.0 g
of DI water under stirring, respectively; 4.0 mmol β-CD (Znmol2+/β-CDmol = 1:1) was added
into the HmIM solution and stirred until it dissolves. Then, the Zn(NO3)2 solution was poured into the HmIM/β-CD
solution and stirring was continued for 5 min. After the obtained
white suspension stood for 24 h at room temperature, centrifugation
was carried out with DI water three times to ensure purity. The white
powder was collected after the precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven
at 60 °C for 24 h.44

4.3 PMIA Spinning Solution
Prior to the preparation of the casting solution, PMIA was rinsed
with plenty of DI water and dried in an oven at 105 °C. During
this time, certain amounts of LiCl and DMAc were mixed and the solution
was heated up to 80 °C.15 Then, the
preweighed dry PMIA was gradually added into the LiCl/DMAc solution
under mechanical stirring and kept for 24 h. The homogeneous brown
transparent spinning solution was stored in the oven at 80 °C
overnight before spin-coating for degassing. Detailed information
is presented in Table 5. We note for the membranes PPA2505, the nanoparticles were dispersed
into the LiCl/DMAc solution by 30 min ultrasonic treatment before
feeding.

4.4 PMIA Support
Membrane Formation
The PMIA support membrane was prepared
by the NIPS method with the assistance of spin-coating technique.
Specifically, PMIA spin coating was achieved via a spinner produced
by Laurell (model WS-650MZ-23NPPB) equipped with a Rocker 300 vacuum
pump in the nitrogen environment (0.4 MPa). The PI nanofiber was rinsed
with a sufficient amount of IPA to remove impurities and dried in
air before stuck onto the PMMA disk. To obtain the uniform membrane
structure and thickness, configurations of the spinner never changed
during the experiment, during which the spin speed was set to 3500
rpm for 7.0 s, 4000 rpm for 3.0 s, and 5000 rpm for 5.0 s in sequence.
After spinning, the disk was immersed in a 25 °C DI water coagulation
bath immediately and solvent exchange occurred. The obtained membranes
were washed with enough DI water and stored in the DI water for further
use.

4.5 PA Selective
Layer Formation
The formation of PA selective layer was achieved
via IP reaction. The present work used 2.0% (w/v) MPD and 0.15% (w/v)
TMC (with or without nanoparticles) as aqueous-phase and organic-phase
solutions, respectively. Generally, the above prepared membrane was
fixed onto a stainless steel hoop with membrane surface upward and
the liquor outside the membrane was removed using a tissue paper.
The as-formed PMIA support membrane was treated in an aqueous-phase
solution first for 2 min, followed by 1 min polymerization in an organic-phase
solution.45 Subsequently, the overdosage
was rapidly removed and volatilized in the ambient air and then ripened
in an oven at 80 °C for 5 min. The as-prepared β-CD@ZIF-8-doped
TFN OSN membranes were washed and stored in DI water for further study.31

4.6 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) device
(MiniFlex600, Japan) was employed to characterize the crystal phase
of ZIF-8 and β-CD@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, in which Cu Kα
radiation and 2θ range of 20–80° were used under
the 40 kV 100 mA.46

A field emission
scanning electron microscope (Nova NanoSEM 450, Japan) was used to
capture images of the as-prepared nanoparticles and TFN OSN membranes.
All samples were gold-sputtered for 50 s for electroconductibility.47,48 Nanoparticles were also observed by a high-resolution transmission
electron microscope (JEM 2100, Japan).

An effective area of
10 μm × 10 μm for each sample membrane was scanned
by an atomic force microscope (Veeco, NanoScope IIIa Multimode AFM)
in tapping mode to illuminate the 3D surface topography and roughness.49

With respect to chemical compositions,
a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Nicolet-6700) was used
and the spectra of nanoparticles and TFN OSN membranes were collected
from 4000 to 600 cm–1. XPS (Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi)
and EDX (JEOL JSM-6306LV) analyses were also conducted for quantification.50,51

Dynamic water contact angle (DCA) measurement of the nanoparticles
and TFN OSN membranes was performed to judge the wettability. A contact
angle analyzer (JC2000D, Shanghai Zhongchen Digital Technology Apparatus
Co., Ltd., China) was used to capture nanoparticles for 60 s and membranes
for 180 s with 2 μL of water droplet on the compacted nanoparticles
and membrane surface at 25 °C.52,53

4.7 OSN Performances
The
OSN performances of TFN OSN membranes were evaluated according to
a variety of pure solvent fluxes (PSFs), dye/solvent separation performance,
MWCO determination, and its application in pharmaceutical recovery.
A self-designed cross-flow OSN filtration system with an effective
filtration area of 4π cm2 was propelled by a gear
pump (WT3000-1JB, Longer Pump, China) with sealed pipelines made of
stainless steel. The operation pressure was maintained at 0.6 MPa.
All reported values were measured at least thrice and averaged.

4.7.1 PSF Tests
PSF was
tested through a series of polar protic solvents (e.g., MeOH, EtOH, n-PrOH, and IPA) and polar aprotic solvents (e.g., THF,
AcOEt, acetone, and DMF) and their properties are shown in Table S2. The sample membrane was prewetted with
the testing solvent and rinsed three times before loading onto the
OSN cell. After 30 min preloading before collecting the permeance,
a 5.0 mL graduated cylinder was placed under the permeate pipeline
and sealed. After the graduated cylinder was filled with 5.0 mL (0.005
L) of the testing solvent, the collecting time was recorded and the
PSF (L m–2 h–1) was obtained according
to the equation 1  where V is the permeate volume (L), A is the
effective filtration area (m2), and t is
the permeate time (h).

4.7.2 Dye/Solvent Separation
CV (Mw = 407.98 g mol–1), MB (Mw = 799.80 g mol–1), and RB (Mw = 973.67 g mol–1) were used as the
target solutes in dye/solvent separation experiment. The solute properties
are presented in Table S3. A small quantity
(35 μM) of each dye in MeOH and THF were prepared separately.54 The feed and the permeate solution were collected
after preloading and determined by a UV spectrophotometer (UV-1800,
Shimadzu, Japan). Then, the dye separation could be achieved through
rejection according to 2  where Cf and Cp are the feed and permeate solution absorbances, respectively.55

4.7.3 MWCO vs Rejection Curve Determination
The MWCO determination
of TFN OSN membranes was achieved by a reverse-phase HPLC system with
PPG oligomers as the sample detector, and detailed information was
provided by Patterson et al.35 In the present
work, a Waters HPLC system consists of a 1525 binary pump, a 2420
ELSD, and a column oven within a column (InfinityLab Poroshell 120
EC-C18, 4.6 × 250 mm2, 2.7 μm) for analysis.
DI water and MeCN were used as the mobile phase, and the system was
operated under nitrogen atmosphere at 0.5 MPa. The purpose of HPLC
system determination was to obtain the concentration of each unit
of PPG in the feed and permeate. The feed solution was mixed with
4.0 g L–1 of PPG 425, PPG 725, and PPG 1000 in MeOH,
and the permeate solution was collected after 30 min preloading. The
rejection of each PPG unit could also be calculated from eq 2. In addition, pore size distribution
curves of TFN OSN membrane were established according to the rejection
value of n-BuOH, glucose, sucrose, and raffinose
(74, 180, 342, and 504 g mol–1, Table S3) with further calculation through log-normal model
using MATLAB software.56

4.7.4 Erythromycin Concentration
Application
Erythromycin (EM, Mw = 733.93 g mol–1) is an antibiotic widely used
in pharmacology, whose concentration and purification from fermentor
still suffer from high cost and low efficiency. After the TFN OSN
has been developed, it finds application in EM concentration and purification.
We simulated an EM sample of low concentration (500 ppm) in both MeOH
and BA. A total organic carbon (TOC) instrument was used to determine
the concentration of EM in the feed and the permeate. In detail, 1.0
mL of feed and permeance were added into a sample bottle separately,
dried in a vacuum oven, and redissolved by 15.0 mL of DI water, followed
by TOC measurement. The data were tested thrice and their mean values
were reported.

4.7.5 Swelling Behavior
Swelling behavior experiment was conducted
by immersing the TFN OSN membranes in eight solvents, including MeOH,
EtOH, IPA, THF, EtOAc, acetone, DMF, and DI water, for 24 h, and the
area swelling ratio and solvent uptake ratio were calculated according
to eqs 3 and 4. 3   4  where Adry and Awet are the membrane areas
before and after solvent immersion, respectively, and Wdry and Wwet are the membrane
weights before and after solvent immersion, respectively.57,58

4.7.6 Mechanical
Properties
The mechanical properties were tested using an
electronic mechanical property analyzer (QJ210A, Shanghai Qingji Instrument
Technology Co., Ltd., China) to report the mean break strength, elongation
at break, and Young’s modulus of the as-prepared OSN membranes.
Three samples of each membrane were cut into 50 mm × 15 mm rectangles
and tested at 50 mm min–1.59,60

4.8 DMF Long-Term
Stability
DMF long-term stability was tested through operating
the membrane PPA, PPA05, and PPA2505, under pure DMF steam at 0.6
MPa. PPA05 and PPA2505 were tested consecutively for 12 h, and PPA
for 6 h to figure out the DMF stability differences between the as-prepared
TFC and TFN OSN membranes. The pure DMF flux was recorded every 0.5
h and then 35 μM RB/DMF was pumped through those OSN membranes
instead of pure DMF. The permeance and feed were collected and analyzed
by a UV-1800 spectrophotometer to determine the RB rejection.
