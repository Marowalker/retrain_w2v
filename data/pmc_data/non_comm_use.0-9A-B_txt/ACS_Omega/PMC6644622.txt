The M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp levels
of theory were used to investigate the effect of substituents on the
stability of the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR molecule. For comparison,
small groups (F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3) and sterically
bulky substituents, (Ar* (=C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-i-Pr3)2), Tbt (=C6H2-2,4,6-{CH(SiMe3)2}3), SiiPrDis2, and SiMe(SitBu3)2), were chosen for the present study. The density functional theory
results indicate that the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR compounds with
small ligands are transient intermediates, so their experimental detections
should be extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the theoretical observations
demonstrate that only the bulkier ligands can effectively stabilize
the central Tl≡Sb triple bond. In addition, the valence-electron
bonding model reveals that the bonding characters of the triple-bonded
RTl≡SbR species possessing sterically bulky groups can be represented
as RTl ← SbR.
Nevertheless, on the basis of the natural resonance theory, the natural
bond orbital, and the charge decomposition analysis, the theoretical
observations suggest that the Tl≡Sb triple bond in the acetylene
analogues, RTl≡SbR, should be very weak.

I Introduction
Due to their usage in studying fundamental chemistry problems as
well as potential applications, the synthesis and isolation of heavy
homonuclear alkyne analogues, RE14≡E14R (E14 = group 14 elements), have been attracting significant
interest for at least 30 years.1−28 Recently, the interests in synthesis have turned into preparing
heteronuclear ethyne analogues, RC≡E14R, in which
one of the carbon atoms in acetylene is substituted by one of the
heavy group 14 elements (Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb).29−36 From the valence-electron viewpoint, the heavier acetylene analogues,
RE13≡E15R (E13 = B, Al, Ga,
In, and Tl and E15 = N, P, As, Sb, and Bi) is isoelectronic
to HC≡CH. Unfortunately, to date, the study of such acetylene
analogues with groups 13 and 15 elements is still lacking from both
experimental and theoretical viewpoints.37−41

In recent years, it has been reported that optoelectronic devices
based on thallium–E15 have advantages over E12–E16 (E12 = group 12 elements
and E16 = group 16 elements) semiconductor devices because
it has been discovered that most Tl–E15 compounds
have a very narrow band gap.42−51 In fact, many ternary molecules possessing heteroatomic anions from
E1–Tl–E15 (E1 = group
1 elements) main group species have been prepared and isolated.52−63 Of which, for instance, a series of novel metallic compounds with
the E1–Tl–Sb form have been discovered and
structurally characterized.64−68 Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, until now no molecules
bearing the Tl≡Sb triple bond, which is isoelectronic to acetylene,
have been examined either experimentally or theoretically.

It is the possibility of forming the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR
molecules with the kinetic stability from the substituent viewpoints
that has aroused our interest for the present study. For comparison,
two kinds of ligands have been chosen in the present study. The small
groups (such as F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3) have
been chosen in this work. On the other hand, the sterically bulky
substituents69−71 (such as Ar* = C6H3-2,6-(C6H2-2,4,6-i-Pr3)2), Tbt = C6H2-2,4,6-{CH(SiMe3)2}3), SiiPrDis2, and SiMe(SitBu3)2), which
are given in Scheme 1, have been used in this study. Three kinds of density functional
theory (DFT) have been applied in this study. They are M06-2X/Def2-TZVP,
B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp methods (Supporting Information). The theoretical results will convince
experimental chemists that a molecule that contains a Tl≡Sb
triple bond is not an unrealistic proposition, and it is expected
that successful schemes for the synthesis and isolation of these triple-bonded
species will be devised soon.

Scheme 1 II Results and Discussion
II.I Small Ligands on Substituted RTl≡SbR
In this section, we first use
the intramolecular 1,2-shift reaction to explore the effects of small
ligands (R = CH3, H, F, OH, and CH3) on the
relative stability of the RTlSbR species including the triple-bonded
and double-bonded isomers. That is, RTl≡SbR → TS1 →
R2Tl=Sb: and RTl≡SbR → TS2 →:
Tl=SbR2. The DFT results for three methods mentioned
earlier are collected in Figure 1.

Figure 1 M06-2X/Def2-TZVP, B3PW91/Def2-TZVP, and B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp surfaces
for RTl≡SbR (R = F, OH, H, CH3, and SiH3). These Gibbs free energies are in kcal/mol. For details see the
text.

As seen in Figure 1, all the theoretical results coming from the three DFT investigations
reveal that the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR compounds should be unstable
on the energy surfaces of the 1,2-shifted migration reactions, regardless
of the electronegative or electropositive substituents. In other words,
once the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR compound possessing small substituents
(R) is formed, it can readily undergo the 1,2-migration to yield other
kind of double-bonded isomer.

Nevertheless, referring to Figure 1, one may find that some of the barriers for the 1,2-shifted
migration reactions are fairly large, in excess of 20 kcal/mol, in
both directions for substituents such as H, Me, and SiH3. In spite of the fact that we did not consider the solvent effect
for these species in this work, the present computational results
imply that the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR molecules bearing the
above small ligands might exist in the gas phase. However, this prediction
needs to be greatly verified by the more sophisticatedly theoretical
methods. Unfortunately, this is beyond the scope of the present study.
Accordingly, the above theoretical analyses demonstrate that the triple-bonded
RTl≡SbR compounds bearing the small ligands should not be detected
experimentally as well as isolated in the laboratory, even in a low-temperature
inert matrix. This theoretical conclusion is the same as in the previous
cases found for RB≡SbR,72 RAl≡SbR,73 RGa≡SbR,74 and RIn≡SbR75 systems bearing
small groups (R). In consequence, all of these theoretical observations
strongly suggest that no matter what kind of electronegativity for
the small ligands (R) are attached, the triple-bonded RE13≡SbR molecules cannot exist in the normal conditions. Therefore,
we turn our attention on the effect of bulky ligands on the triple-bonded
thallium≡antimony compounds in the next section.

II.II Large Ligands on Substituted R′Tl≡SbR′
In this section, we use the bulkier substituents to see whether
they can be kinetically stabilized as a monomer. Like the cases of
small groups on substituted RTl≡SbR, we use four bulky ligands
(R′= Ar*, Tbt, SiiPrDis2, and SiMe(SitBu3)2; Scheme 1)69−71 to explore the relative energies
between the triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′ species and
its corresponding double-bonded isomers. Namely, R′Tl≡SbR′
→ R2′Tl=Sb (ΔH1) and R′Tl≡SbR′ → Tl=SbR2′ (ΔH2), as shown
in Scheme 2. On the
dispersion-corrected M06-2X/Def2-TZVP level of theory,76 the theoretical results are shown in Table 1. It is apparent to
see that both reaction enthalpies (ΔH1 and ΔH2) are predicted to be quite
high (>82 kcal/mol). The theoretical evidence, therefore, suggests
the Tl≡Sb triple bond can be greatly stabilized when it is
attached by two bulkier ligands.

e See Scheme 2.

f The WBI for the Tl≡Sb bond:
see refs (77, 78).

As seen in Table 1, the Tl≡Sb triple bond length is predicted to be 2.764–2.822
Å based on the present theoretical calculations. In fact, these
computed Tl≡Sb triple-bond distances are quite similar to the
estimated value (277 pm) based on the specific triple-bond covalent
radii reported by Pyykkö and co-workers.79,80

Moreover, Table 1 indicates that the ∠R′–Tl–Sb and ∠Tl–Sb–R′
bond angles are about 160 and 110°, respectively. These computational
values are different from those of the ∠R–Tl–Sb
and ∠Tl–Sb–R bond angles for the RTl≡SbR
molecules bearing small substituents (Table S1). The reason for this is still uncertain. Presumably, it could be
due to sterically congested systems.

From Table 1, the
DFT calculations foresee that the R′–Tl unit has the
singlet ground state, whereas the R′–Sb moiety has the
triplet ground state. In particular, the DFT results demonstrate the
ΔETl′ of the R′–Tl
component is evaluated to be larger than 34 kcal/mol, whereas the
modulus of ΔESb′ for the
R′–Sb fragment is estimated to be larger than 16 kcal/mol.
These theoretical results suggest the bonding characters of the triple-bonded
R′Tl≡SbR′ species can be diagrammatically represented
in Figure 2[II], which
somewhat differs from Figure 2[I].81,82 In other words, the triplet R′–Tl
unit and the triplet R′–Sb moiety can combine to produce
a triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′ molecule at the singlet
ground state, i.e., [R′–Tl]3 + [R′–Sb]3 → [R′Tl≡SbR′]1. From Figure 2, the bonding picture
based on the valence bond theory strongly suggests model [II], , is better to interpret the nature of the
Tl≡Sb triple bond in the R′Tl≡SbR′ molecule.
Namely, the Tl≡Sb triple bond in the R′Tl≡SbR′
species can be considered as one σ-bond, one π-bond, and
one donor–acceptor π-bond (R′Tl ← SbR′).
Again, two factors can influence the bond orders of the triple bonds
in the R′Tl≡SbR′ species. As seen in Figure 2, one is the lone pair of orbitals
of both R′–Sb and R′–Tl components consist
of the valence s and p orbitals. The other is the covalent radii of
Tl (148 pm) and Sb (140 pm) are different,83 which, in turn, can make small overlap between the two heteroatoms.
Moreover, due to the sterically congested substituents (R′)
being attached to Tl and Sb atoms, these would again make the overlap
between them to be much smaller. As a result, one may easily conceive
that the bond order of the Tl≡Sb triple bond in the R′Tl≡SbR′
bearing bulky groups should not be strong. Indeed, the calculated
Wiberg bond index (WBI) collected in Table 1 suggests all the bond orders of the Tl≡Sb
triple bonds are predicted to be about 2.1. Fortunately, these bond
orders are much larger than the WBI values given in Table S1 for the systems of small ligands on substituted RTl≡SbR.

Figure 2 Valence-bond bonding models [I] and [II] for the triple-bonded
RTl≡SbR molecule.

After submitting this paper, one reviewer proposed a question why
the larger substituents produce a triple bond (Table 1), whereas smaller groups clearly give a
double bond (Table S1). Presumably, the
reason for this could be due to the nature of the two components (R–Tl
and R–Sb) in RTl≡SbR possessing small substituents as
well as two units (R′–Tl and R′–Sb) in
R′Tl≡SbR′ featuring bulky ligands. As can be
seen in Table S1, the modulus of ΔETl for R–Tl is substantially larger than
that (|ΔESb|) for R–Sb. As
a result, the bonding nature of the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR molecule
prefers to adopt model [I],  (Figure 2). That is, one donor–acceptor σ-bond
(RTl → SbR) and two donor–acceptor π-bonds (RTl
← SbR). However, this Tl–Sb triple bond in the RTl≡SbR
species with small groups is quite weak, showing the double-bond character
as represented in Table S1. On the other
hand, according to the above discussion, the bonding nature of R′Tl≡SbR′
follows model [II], . Therefore, from Figure 2, due to the overlap populations in model
[II] being larger than those in model [I], the bulky groups generate
a triple bond, whereas smaller ligands yield a double bond. This anticipation
has been confirmed by the present computational data given in Tables 1 and S1, respectively.

Besides these, as already shown in Table S1, three DFT computational data show that the Tl≡Sb triple
bond length (Å) in RTl≡SbR is in the region of 2.630–2.758
(M06-2X/Def2-TZVP), 2.621–2.727 (B3PW91/Def2-TZVP), and 2.622–2.757
(B3LYP/LANL2DZ+dp), whose WBIs are predicted to be 0.988–1.394,
1.080–1.466, and 1.129–1.492, respectively. It has to
be emphasized here that from Table S1,
their dissociation energies are predicted to be small, less than 40
kcal/mol, for a Tl≡Sb triple bond. This is very much smaller
than that in acetylene. That is to say, the theoretical evidences
demonstrate that the RTl≡SbR molecules with small ligands are
very unstable. A similar situation can be noticed in some other metal–metal
bonds such as the Ga≡Ga triple bond in question. Some interesting
works concerning the Ga≡Ga triple bond can be found in refs (84−92).

The charge decomposition analysis (CDA)93 is utilized to interpret the interactions between SiMe(SitBu3)2–Tl and SiMe(SitBu3)2–Sb units. As seen in Table 2, the largest contributions
from a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Sb
fragment to a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Tl fragment is no. 176 (HOMO) orbital, demonstrating that
the former donates electrons (0.0801 e) to the latter mainly through
the HOMO orbital. Also, the largest contributions from a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Tl component to a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Sb component is no.
175 (HOMO – 1) orbital, indicating that the former donates
electrons (0.0986 e) to the latter principally through the HOMO –
1 orbital. After considering the electron donations from various orbital
of both SiMe(SitBu3)2–Sb
and SiMe(SitBu3)2–Tl,
one may obtain the net amount of electron transfer, which is calculated
to be negative (−0.728), suggesting that a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Sb unit donates more electrons
to a SiMe(SitBu3)2–Tl
unit. This result based on the CDA computations is in good agreement
with model [II] (Figure 2). The computational CDA results for the other three groups (R′=
SiiPrDis2, Tbt, and Ar*) are collected
in the Supporting Information. Again, these
theoretical evidences demonstrate that the bonding character of R′Tl≡SbR′
is represented as .

Both natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis77,78 and the natural resonance theory (NRT)94−96 were applied
to determine their electron densities of triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′
bearing bulkier ligands, whose calculated results are given in Table 3. In the case of (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–Tl≡Sb–(SiMe(SitBu3)2), for instance, the Tl≡Sb
triple bond is composed of a σ-bond, which is equally distributed
on Tl and Sb atoms (Tl: 49%, Sb: 51%). On the other hand, the π
component is strongly polarized toward the Sb center (Tl: 15%, Sb:
85% and Tl: 12%, Sb: 88% for π⊥ and π∥, respectively). The strong polarization of the Tl–Sb
bond and the high occupancies of its NBO lead to a small WBI of 2.15,
all of which suggest the presence of a rather weak Tl≡Sb bond.
Further supporting the data obtained by NRT (Table 3) demonstrate that the Tl≡Sb triple
bond has a short single bond character (25%) and quite a short triple
bond character (11%) but a high double bond character (64%) due to
the fact the covalent portion of the NRT (1.06) is higher than its
ionic part (0.79). In addition, as seen in Table 3, the dispersion-corrected M06-2X/Def2-TZVP
results reveal NBO(Tl≡Sb for π⊥) =
0.385(6s6p99.99)Tl + 0.923(5s5p42.44)Sb and
NBO(Tl≡Sb for π∥) = 0.326(6s6p99.99)Tl + 0.944(5s5p6.77)Sb, which strongly demonstrate
that the major bonding nature between (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–Tl and (SiMe(SitBu3)2)–Sb components emerges from 6p(Tl) ←
5p(Sb), as schematically shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Accordingly, the above theoretical analyses
strongly indicate the triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′
compounds featuring bulkier substituents should have a very weak Tl≡Sb
triple bond.

II.III Overview of the Triple-Bonded RE13≡SbR Molecules
We have used the DFT computations
to theoretically design substituted RE13≡SbR molecules
that feature an E13≡Sb triple bond, which can be
detected and characterized in the experiments. From the comparisons
between this work (RTl≡SbR) and other previous studies (RB≡SbR,72 RAl≡SbR,73 RGa≡SbR,74 and RIn≡SbR75), several major conclusions can be drawn:(1) For the triple-bonded RE13≡SbR molecules bearing the small substituents, our theoretical
evidences reveal that they should not be observable in the experiments.

(2) Our theoretical observations suggest
that only the sterically bulky ligands (R′) can greatly stabilize
the triple-bonded R′E13≡SbR′ molecules
from the kinetic viewpoint.

(3) Nevertheless, our theoretical results
demonstrate that the triple bond between the E13 and antimony
elements in the acetylene-like R′E13≡SbR′
species is quite weak. Its bond order is theoretically estimated to
be slightly above 2.0.

(4) The reason for having such a weak
E13≡Sb triple bond is simple: the atomic sizes as
well as the electronegativity values for E13 and Sb are
different because they belong to different rows of the periodic table
having different principal quantum numbers. This, in turn, makes the
overlapping relationship between E13 and antimony small.

(5) On the basis of our theoretical examinations,
it is suggested that the bonding nature of the acetylene analogues,
R′E13≡SbR′, should be described as
R′E13. Namely, its E13≡Sb triple
bond contains one conventional σ (E13–Sb)
bond, one conventional π (E13=Sb) bond, and
one donor–acceptor π (E13 ← Sb) bond.

(6) Our theoretical studies indicate that
relativistic effects (or the so-called orbital nonhybridization effect
and the inert s-pair effect)97−100 play a vivid role in determining the geometrical
structures of the triple-bonded R′E13≡SbR′
compounds. In other words, the triple-bonded R′E13≡SbR′ molecule possessing sterically bulky groups adopts
a bent structure, i.e., ∠R′–E13–Sb
< 180.0° and ∠E13–Sb–R′
> 90.0°.



III Conclusions
The present study reported on the possibility of the formation
of the triple-bonded RTl≡SbR possessing various kinds of chemical
substituents. The present theoretical findings demonstrate that only
sterically large ligands can greatly stabilize the RTl≡SbR
molecule. We anticipate that suppose the introduction of bulky substituents
is beneficial, the silyl bulky groups should be a good alternative
to bulk-based groups. The computational evidences studied in the present
study strongly suggest that the effects of the bulky substituents
can definitively increase the bond order between Tl and Sb. This work
is the first theoretical study about the possibility of forming of
a triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′ molecule. It is found
that by using the overcrowding large ligands as appropriate substituents
(R′), the generation of a triple-bonded R′Tl≡SbR′
molecule is feasible. Nevertheless, similar to the cases of the other
triple-bonded RB≡SbR,72 RAl≡SbR,73 RGa≡SbR,74 and RIn≡SbR75 molecules, our theoretical
investigations suggest the bonding natures of such R′Tl≡SbR′
compounds possessing bulkier substituents should be viewed as . In particular, the Tl≡Sb triple
bond in R′Tl≡SbR′ possessing sterically bulky
ligands is anticipated to be very weak.
