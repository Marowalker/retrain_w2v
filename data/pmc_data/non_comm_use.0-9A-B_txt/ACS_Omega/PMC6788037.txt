Heavy
metals not
only pollute the environment but also are health and environmental
hazard. Bacteria constitute inexpensive and eco-friendly material
to eliminate and recycle heavy metals via biomineralization and biosorption.
However, the effect of metal biomineralization in bacterial biofilms
on the ecological balance of bacteria and infectious diseases is unclear.
This study aimed to explore the interaction between a eukaryotic cell
line HEK293T and mineralized Escherichia coli, using a model of gold biomineralization on E. coli biofilms (E. coli-Au). In our present
model, bacterial activity was not disrupted and bacterial adhesion
and invasion were enhanced. E. coli-Au invaded the cytoplasm and nuclei of HEK293T cells and damaged
them via intracellular growth and multiplication. The present findings
indicate that metal biomineralization in bacterial biofilms for leaching
of heavy metal ions is hazardous to eukaryotic cells and even human
health.

1 Introduction
Heavy-metal
pollution
resulting from anthropogenic factors including technological advancements
is one of the most prominent environmental concerns today,1,2 threatening human health and the ecosystem via exposure to heavy
metals including Pd, Pt, Ag, Au, and Ru.3,4 Methods for
metal ion leaching from aqueous solutions primarily includes physical,
chemical, and biological technologies.5−7 Various biological materials,
especially bacteria,
have received increasing attention for heavy metal leaching and recovery
owing to their optimal performance, low cost, and high availability.8−10 Relatively inexpensive and eco-friendly
alternatives to conventional methods have allowed for enhanced biomineralization
and biosorption technology.3,11 Nonetheless, large-scale
industrial wastewater treatment still seems a distant reality.9 However, one major concern is that these new
technologies to counter heavy-metal pollution may result in certain
side effects including invasive bacteria and some new infectious diseases.

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are the major components
of biofilms, primarily comprising polysaccharides and proteins.12,13 Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria contain up to a 20–80
nm peptidoglycan layer.14 EPS essentially
protects bacteria from environmental stresses including antibiotic
agents, desiccation, extreme temperature, predation, high salinity,
and pH conditions.15,16 Bacteria have various mechanisms
to reduce and biomineralize metal ions using organic molecules and
functional groups in EPS to decrease their toxicity.17−22 The amino,
thiol, carboxyl, and phenolic groups in bacterial biofilms play crucial
roles in binding and effectively immobilizing heavy-metal ions and
reducing them to elementary substances (zerovalent) or zerovalent
nanoparticles.23−25 Bacterial
biomineralization can also enrich toxic metals under certain conditions,
with potentially calamitous effects on human health.26 Moreover, whether metal biomineralization in bacterial
biofilms disrupts the ecological balance of bacteria and introduces
new diseases is a major potential concern.

Bacteria are one
of the major components of the biosphere and their number, greatly
exceeding that of all plants and animals, is approximately 5 ×
1030.27 They are extremely adaptable
to natural environments, with high survival rates in diverse habitats.
They grow in the deepest oceans, the driest deserts, the coldest habitats,
and the most saturated salt brines. Bacterial surfaces play a critical
role in interactions between bacteria and their natural environment.28

However, no study has reported whether
bacteria widely used for heavy metal leaching can alter its biological
characteristics and threaten human health. Bacteria in the human body,
including the gut microflora, and numerous skin-dwelling bacteria
outnumber human cells by a factor of 10:1.29 Furthermore, several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause
infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy,
bubonic plague, and so on. Therefore, to study and understand the
relationship between bacterial biomineralization and eucaryotic cell
and biology has become the problem that brook no delay.

Compared
with other metals, gold is rare, inert, and nonessential and does
not form free ions in aqueous solution under surface conditions. It
has been widely used in many high-tech fields, such as electronic,
aerospace, chemical, medical, and so on. Moreover, the role of microorganisms
as main drivers of metal mobility and mineral formation under Earth
surface conditions is now widely accepted and bacterial biofilms are
deemed to be associated with secondary gold grains from two sites.18,30 Recently, many papers have reported that the biological ways of
synthesizing metal nanoparticles via using microorganism have become
an effective alternative.31,32 Gold nanoparticles
have
attracted the highest amount of attention owing to their dynamic properties
at the nanoscale and have been well-used in biomedical, bioimaging,
cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery, genetic engineering, and
cancer treatment.33−35 Hence,
gold biomineralization on bacterial biofilms was easy to establish
and obtain.

In this study, we generated a model of gold biomineralization
on Escherichia coli biofilms (E. coli-Au) to investigate changes in bacterial biological
characteristics and its effect on eukaryotic cells.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Model of Gold Biomineralization
on E. coli Biofilms
Compared
to most other metals, gold (Au) is rare, inert, and nonessential to
bacteria and does not form free ions in aqueous solutions at surface
conditions, while zerovalent gold nanoparticles are promising candidates
for biomedical and environmental applications because of their chemical
inertness, pronounced biocompatibility, and characteristic photoelectric
effect.36,37 It is of paramount importance to develop
clean, nontoxic, and environmentally benign synthetic technologies
for gold nanoparticles.38−40 Proteins biomineralize metal
nanoparticles for various biomedical
applications, such as biosensing, biolabeling, bioimaging, and mimicking
enzyme function, such as bovine serum albumin, fibrinogen, α-lactalbumin,
lysozyme, and cytochrome c.41,42 There
are numerous similarities in the natural properties of proteins and
peptide. Some studies reported that specific amino acid sequences
of designed peptides harvested to biomineralize metal nanoparticles,
such as thiol-containing amino acids possessing both reduction and
coordination ability with metal ions and tyrosine (Y) and tryptophan
(W), are efficient reducing groups.43 The
peptide cysteine–cysteine–tyrosine was designed to directly
reduce Au ions into zerovalent Au through the phenolic group of tyrosine
under alkaline conditions without requiring additional reducing agents
and capture the Au atom using the −SH group of cysteine.44

In this study, we also generated alkaline
conditions with E. coli and Au3+ to reduce Au ions into zerovalent Au and captured Au nanoparticles
(Au NPs) by bacterial biofilms, as shown in Scheme 1. First, Au ions (HAuCl4) were
added dropwise into the E. coli suspension.
After stirring well, the final pH of the solution was adjusted to
∼10 with NaOH and the phenolic group of tyrosine (Tyr) residues,
which are present on the surface protein of E. coli, was converted into a negative phenolic ion that can reduce Au ions
to Au atoms. Thereafter, E. coli was
discarded via centrifugation and the resultant Au atoms in the supernatant
solution aggregated to form Au NPs (Scheme 1A). With time, the solution gradually became
black from yellow (Figures 1 and S2). Au NPs were obtained
via high-speed centrifugation, and Na+, OH–, and other ions were eliminated. Finally, Au NPs were mixed again
in the E. coli suspension. At this
point, Au NPs were captured by E. coli (Scheme 1B).

of NaOH led to the conversion of the phenolic group of tyrosine on
the cell wall of E. coli to a phenoxide
ion, which can oxidize Au ions. The resultant Au atoms aggregate into
Au NPs. (B) Au NPs are coated by the SH groups of the proteins in
the cell wall of E. coli to form E. coli-Au. (C) HEK293T cells were incubated with E. coli-Au for 3, 6, and 24 h. E.
coli-Au can be adsorbed and can penetrate the host
cell plasma membrane, eventually invading the cytoplasm and nucleus
and retaining bacterial proliferation and damaging the nucleus.

2.2 Characterization of Gold
Biomineralization in E. coli Biofilms
The morphology of E. coli and E. coli-Au were examined via optical microscopy (Figure S2). The size of E. coli-Au decreased significantly, compared with the control group (E. coli). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement
was used to further examine the change in size. The results were consistent
with the aforementioned results (Figure 1B). After attracting Au NPs, the size of E. coli reduced from 1328 ± 267.5 to 658.7 ±
100.4 (n = 3, top-right corner of Figure 1B) mostly because the osmotic
pressure at the E. coli habitat increased.
Furthermore, the surface charges of E. coli and E. coli-Au were also analyzed
via DLS. We observed that both E. coli and E. coli-Au were negatively charged
(see Figure 1C). In
comparison, E. coli harbored a more
negative charge (E. coli vs E. coli-Au: −47.4 ± 2.36 vs −33.9
± 3.56; Figure 1C and top-right corner of Figure 1B). Since Au NPs coated the bacterial surface, E. coli-Au with more positive charge had a decreased
negative charge and their size also decreased, which is beneficial
for the adhesion between cytomembranes and E. coli.

A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) was
utilized to explore the Au core size distribution on the surface of E. coli. The mean size of Au cluster was 10–20
nm (Figure 1D). Moreover,
the size of E. coli was approximately
600–700 nm, consistent with the results of DLS. In Figure 1D, small Au NPs were
evenly distributed on the extracellular surface of E. coli, e.g., at the capsule, pilus, cell wall,
or cytomembrane. The cell wall is the outermost layer and primarily
comprises phospholipids, proteins, and lipopolysaccharides.21,30 These macromolecular assemblies can provide some activating groups
to capture Au NPs. However, we did not obtain an associated database
to support these results, and hence the search for E. coli-Au will continue.

2.3 Biological
Property of Au NPs Modifying E. coli Biofilms
During the synthesis of E. coli-Au, it should first be considered whether
chemical reactions disrupted the growth and genetic material of bacteria.
The Ampr-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-plasmid
was transformed into E. coli, and agarose
gel electrophoresis was performed to confirm the plasmid stability
in E. coli-Au. As shown in Figure 2A, the plasmid in
lane 3 was not degraded in the E. coli-Au group and remained in high concordance with the control group.
On comparison with the other two groups, E. coli + Au (E. coli + HAuCl4) and E. coli-Au + OH– (E. coli + HACl4 + NaOH),
the corresponding band of the plasmid was not observed on the agarose
gel (lanes 4 and 5; Figure 2A). HAuCl4 could degrade the plasmid, along with
the acidic environment. To assess the growth activity of E. coli, four groups were cultured overnight in the
LB medium supplemented with ampicillin, with agitation at 37 °C
(Figure 2B). E. coli adsorbing Au NPs yet underwent proliferation,
which was similar to that of individual E. coli upon measuring the absorbance value at 600 nm (n = 3, see Figure 2C). Because of the degradation of the plasmid or genetic material
of bacteria, the proliferation of E. coli in E. coli + HACl4 + NaOH
and E. coli-Au + NaOH group did not
occur (Figure 2B).

chemical reactions. (B) Images of Luria-Bertani (LB) culture medium
supplemented with ampicillin and shaken overnight after inoculation
of E. coli underwent treatment with
three different chemical reactions. (C) Statistical data for the measurement
of the optical density (OD) at 600 nm of LB culture medium (n = 3).

2.4 Localization
of E. coli-Au in HEK293T Cells
The changes
in size and surface charges of E. coli-Au are supposed to be beneficial to bind and penetrate the cell
membrane in theory. E. coli was labeled
with Texas Red (Texas Red-E. coli; Figure 5S), which yielded a red fluorescence
to track the localization of E. coli in HEK293T cells. A certain amount of E. coli-Au incubated with HEK293T cells does not debilitate the activity
of cells, and the cells retain their normal morphology in 3 h. To
verify the interaction between E. coli-Au and HEK293T cells, confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM)
was used to track Texas Red in live HEK293T cells. Before the CLSM
analysis, the HEK293T cells were incubated with E.
coli and E. coli-Au
for 3 h, and the final density of E. coli in the cell culture medium was 5 × 107 cells/mL.
As shown in row 1 of Figure 3, no Texas Red stained E. coli were observed within the HEK293T when cells were treated with unbound E. coli. However, red fluorescence was observed in
cells upon incubation with E. coli-Au
in row 2 of Figure 3. This result confirmed our hypothesis that E. coli-Au can bind and penetrate the cell membrane.

incubated
with E. coli (row 1) and E. coli-Au (row 2) for 3 h. Cell nuclei are marked
with DAPI (blue) and E. coli are marked
with Texas Red (red).

After 6 h of
co-incubation, we observed red fluorescence in the cytoplasm of HEK293T
cells and observed that E. coli-Au
invaded the HEK293T cells (row 1 of Figures 5A and 4). Unexpectedly,
some E. coli-Au penetrated the karyotheca
and translocated to the nucleus (three-dimensional image in row 1
of Figures 5A and 4). However, the EGFP
gene was not expressed because green fluorescence was not observed
in the cytoplasm (Figure 4). To further verify whether EGFP plasmid was translocated
into the cytoplasm by E. coli-Au, polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was performed to examine the presence of the
EGFP gene in the HEK293T cells. E. coli, E. coli + Au, and E. coli-Au were incubated with HEK293T cells and
the medium was supplemented with ampicillin to eliminate nonresistant
bacteria. Only in the E. coli-Au group,
the EGFP gene was specifically amplified (line 5 of Figure 5B).

are marked with DAPI (blue), E. coli are marked with Texas Red (red), and EGFP yielded a green fluorescence.

Biological membranes
are selectively permeable barriers in bacteria and cells and separates
them into dependent units of life activities. Nonetheless, it is difficult
to enable intracellular translocation of common bacteria by more than
500 nm. However, certain intranuclear bacteria that can invade the
cellular control center of eukaryotes have been identified in protists,
arthropod, marine invertebrate, and mammalian hosts.45 Recently, nanotechnology has been used to deliver certain
bacteria harboring DNA, drugs, and signaling molecules into the cytoplasm
for application in medicine and bioengineering.46−48

2.5 Disruption of Eukaryotic Cells by E. coli-Au
When E. coli-Au was further
cultured with HEK293T cells for 24 h, nuclear fragmentation occurred
and E. coli proliferated via CLSM (row
2 of Figure 5A). After
HEK293T cells were incubated with E. coli-Au and E. coli for different durations
(3, 6, 12, and 24 h), a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed
to assess the cancer cell viability (see Figure 5C). In culture media, the original densities
of E. coli-Au and E.
coli were set as 5 × 107 cells/mL
and, after a 3 h incubation, old medium was replaced with new medium
supplemented with ampicillin. The cell viability ratio decreased to
24.42% in 24 h, consistent with the results of CLSM.

The majority
of bacteria in the body are harmless. However, some pathogenic obligate
intracellular bacteria pose a substantial public health concern owing
to infections and intracellular replication, including Coxiella spp., pathogenic Chlamydia spp., and arthropod-transmitted
members of the Rickettsiales.49 Hence,
it is imaginable that normal extracellular microflora induced to invade
eukaryotic host cells could result in new diseases.

3 Conclusions
In this study,
we developed a model of gold biomineralization on E.
coli biofilms (E. coli-Au) to investigate its effect on eukaryotic cells. The adhesive
force between them increased markedly, E. coli-Au penetrated the plasma membrane of HEK293T cells and even invade
its cytoplasm and nucleus. Ultimately, HEK293T cells were damaged
via intracellular growth and multiplication of invasive E. coli. Briefly, bacteria can potentially eliminate
and cycle heavy metal ions via biomineralization and biosorption;
however, it is important to acknowledge their potential hazards.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Material
HAuCl4·3H2O, NaOH, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
HCl, and HNO3 were obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent
Co. (China); Texas Red was from Thermo Fisher Scientific; Triton X-100
was from Sigma-Aldrich; cell culture media was from Hyclone; and fetal
bovine serum was from Invitrogen. All solutions were prepared using
ultrapure water (18.25 MΩ·cm) from a Millipore system.
All glassware was washed with aqua regia (HCl/HNO3, 3:1
[v/v]) and then rinsed with ultrapure water and ethanol.

4.2 Bacterial Culture and Staining
E. coli expressing EGFP and anti-ampicillin
were cultured in Luria-Bertani medium at 37°C with agitation
at 200 rpm. Bacterial density was monitored spectrophotometrically
at 600 nm (OD600).

Two milligrams of Texas Red was
dissolved in 1.5 mL of DMSO. E. coli were harvested via centrifugation at 10 000g and resuspended in 100 μL of normal saline to obtain 1 ×
107E. coli cells; 10 μL
of Texas Red solution was then added. After 10 min of co-incubation
at room temperature, E. coli were harvested
via subsequent centrifugation at 10 000g.
Thereafter, Texas Red staining of E. coli was traced and located via red fluorescence excitation at 561 nm.

4.3 Model of Gold Biomineralization
on E. Coli Biofilms
For leaching
of Au3+, 5.0 × 107E. coli collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for three
times were added to 5 mL of normal saline and then 0.1 mL of HAuCl4 aqueous solution (10 mM) was gradually added to the E. coli solution (1 × 108 cells/mL)
in a 5 mL vial under vigorous stirring in an ice-bath. After fully
mixing, 400 μL of NaOH solution (0.5 M) was added within 20
s to yield a final pH of 10. This solution was continuously stirred
for 5 min in an ice-bath, and E. coli were removed via 10 000g centrifugation.
This supernatant liquor was collected and allowed to stand for 30
min and zero-valent Au was obtained via centrifugation at 10 000g for 1 min at room temperature. The pellet was cleaned
thrice to eliminate free ions.

Zero-valent Au and a suspension
of 1 × 108E. coli were
mixed and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min to gold
biomineralization on bacterial biofilms. Thereafter, this mixture
was centrifuged at 10 000g for 1 min at room
temperature to harvest E. coli surface-modified
with Au nanoparticles (NPs; E. coli-Au).

4.4 Characterization
of E. coli-Au
The size distribution
and ζ-potential of E. coli and E. coli-Au were determined via dynamic light scattering
(DLS; particle sizing systems) analysis using the NICOMP 380/ZLS,
and the data were analyzed using ZPW388 software. Morphology of E. coli-Au was examined using a field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM) (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan, operated at 10
kV).

4.5 Agarose Gel
Electrophoresis
Plasmids were extracted by small alkali lysis.
After growth for the night, E. coli were collected via subsequent centrifugation at 10 000g and washed with PBS for three times. Then, 100 μL
of 0.5 M NaOH was mixed with E. coli for 5 min to release EGFP plasmids from E. coli.

Plasmid stability was assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis.
Hundred microliters of the samples (5 × 107E. coli, E. coli +
HAuCl4 + NaOH, E. coli +
HAuCl4, E. coli-Au) and
100 μL of 0.5 M NaOH were mixed for 5 min. Six microliters of
mixed liquor was subjected to 1% agarose gel with 0.05 mg/mL ethidium
bromide in TAE buffer (pH = 7.4). The plasmid was electrophoresed
at 90 V for 30 min. Fluorescence signal intensities were measured
and analyzed using C1000Manager Software (BioRad, Hercules, CA).

4.6 Cell Culture
Human embryonic kidney cell
line, HEK293T, was cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium high-glucose medium cell culture supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
solution in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.

4.7 Confocal Microscopy
Cellular uptake
and intracellular distribution of E. coli-Au was visualized using a confocal laser-scanning
microscope. HEK293T cells were seeded on a 35 mm glass-based dish
at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well for 24 h. Old
medium was replenished with fresh medium comprising E. coli and E. coli-Au at a density of 5 × 107 cells/mL of E. coli for 3, 6, and 24 h. Thereafter, staining
with DAPI was performed to assess the cellular uptake. DAPI, EGFP,
and Texas Red were excited at 405, 488, and 561 nm, respectively.

4.8 Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR)
To detect E. coli DNA
in HEK293T cells incubated with E. coli, E. coli + Au, and E. coli-Au, DNA was extracted using 1% Triton X-100
and the EGFP gene was amplified via PCR. The primers for EGFP were
with the forward primers: 5′-TGAACCGCTCGAGCTGAAGGG-3′
and the reverse: 5′-TCCAGCAGGACCATGTGATCGC-3′ (Sangon).
PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 5 min; (94 °C, 30
s; 57 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s) × 20 cycles; 72 °C,
8 min. PCR products were assessed via electrophoresis on a 2% agarose
gel.

4.9 Cell Viability
Assay
Cell viability was evaluated using a Cell Counting
Kit-8 system (CCK-8) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions (Dojindo Laboratory). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at a density of 1 × 104 cells per well. HEK293T cells
were treated with E. coli-Au and E. coli at a density of 5 × 106 for
3 h; thereafter, old medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented
with ampicillin. After 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, 10 μL of CCK-8
solution was added before incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The absorbance
was measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm. The formula for
cell viability assay was that cell viability (%) = [(As – Ab/Ac
– Ab)] × 100%, where As is the experimental group, Ac
is the control group, and Ab is the blank group. All data are presented
as mean ± SEM percentages compared to the OD values of untreated
cells.

4.10 Statistical
Analysis
All data are presented as the mean standard error
of the mean from at least three independent experiments. Statistical
significance was discerned using Student’s t-test.
