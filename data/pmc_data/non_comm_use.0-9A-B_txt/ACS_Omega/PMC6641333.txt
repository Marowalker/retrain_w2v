The
binding modes of o-, m-,
and p-trans-BMPyP with DNA were
studied using their spectroscopic properties. Also, the binding modes
were compared based on the location and number of periphery cationic
methylpyridine ions of the cationic porphyrins. The optical absorption
spectra of the o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP when bound to DNA presented
red shifts and hypochromicity compared to the optical absorption spectrum
of DNA-free cationic porphyrins. m-trans-BMPyP–DNA presented the largest red shifts and hypochromicity.
The results of the circular dichroism spectral analysis indicated
positive and negative bisignate absorption bands in the Soret band
of the porphyrins in the case of all concentration ratios of o- and p-trans-BMPyP–DNA,
and two negative absorption bands were observed in m-trans-BMPyP–DNA. Compared to the size of
the absorption band of the DNA optical absorption spectrum, the results
of the reduced linear (LDr) spectral analysis indicated
mainly small sizes of Soret absorption bands (the absorption spectrum
of porphyrins) and positive LDr values for o- and p-trans-BMPyP–DNA.
In consideration of several of such spectroscopic properties, the
binding of o- and p-trans-BMPyP with DNA can be said to be distant to insertion modes. Although
the case of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA
is an insertion mode, the m-trans-BMPyP molecular surface presented much tilt within the intercalation
pocket. The results of comparing the binding modes of TMPyP having
four periphery cationic methylpyridine ions of cationic porphyrin
indicated that regardless of the number of periphery cationic methylpyridine
ions of cationic porphyrin, in the case of the ortho-position, nonplanarity
due to steric hindrance of the periphery cationic methylpyridine ions
presented outside or groove-binding modes indicative of interaction
with DNA phosphates. Unlike the ortho-position, the para-position
presented different binding modes based on the number of periphery
cationic methylpyridine ions. Only cationic porphyrins having four
periphery cationic methylpyridine ions were inserted into the DNA.
Lastly, regardless of the number of periphery cationic methylpyridine
ions, all meta-positions were inserted into the DNA. This indicated
that at the least the location and the number of periphery cationic
methylpyridine ions of the porphyrins used in this experiment were
important elements that determine insertion into DNA base pairs.

Introduction
Nucleic acid plays an important role in
cellular processes including
cellular separation (DNA replication) and protein synthesis (transcription
and translation).1 During these processes,
both healthy cells and cancerous cells are developed. Because of the
immense strides made in the field of life sciences, many secrets of
life have been uncovered. Yet there still exist several phenomena
associated with life that are yet to be discovered. One of such phenomena
includes the ability of a life-form to self-assemble.2,3 Life-forms, created through the process of self-assembly, have evolved
numerous nanostructures that allow them to perform various functions.
One of the most representative forms of self-assembly that occur in
life-forms is DNA. Throughout the continued research to find treatments
for cancer, DNA has both gained much attention as a storage substance
of genetic information as well as a form of medication. Because of
its high bioconformity, stability regarding its neighboring environment,
and simple interaction between its four bases, DNA has been recognized
as an excellent biomaterial that is both predictable and programmable.4 Ethidium bromide, acridine orange, methylene
blue, Ru(II) complex, porphyrin, and small molecules are often used
to understand the structure and properties of DNA through their interactions
with drug–DNA and protein–DNA.5−11 The study of the interaction between porphyrins and DNA is continuously
gaining interest. Porphyrins have been used to develop artificial
receptors that are used to recognize molecules12 and to develop new chiral catalysts for asymmetric synthesis.13−15 They have also been used to explore biologically important response
mechanisms such as photosynthesis16 and
P450 catalyst17 oxidation–reduction
reactions as well as stereochemical research. Porphyrins are also
considered as attractive molecules in many respects. Porphyrins are
known to have unique spectroscopic properties in terms of absorption
as well as emission. Because of it having an absorption coefficient
value of ×105, even small concentrations in solutions
can be detected. Also, its absorption and emission properties slightly
differ according to the existence of metals in its central core or
mesosubstitution properties nearby. Small molecules such as porphyrins
can induce changes to the stability of DNA structures. The interaction
between porphyrins and DNA involves key-binding modes such as intercalation,
outside self-stacking, and outside random binding. Such binding modes
can be adjusted based on the position and size of substitutions near
the porphyrins as well as the ions of its central-core metals.18−23meso-Tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrins
(TMPyP) and trans-bis(N-methylpyrodinium-4-yl)diphenyl
porphyrins (trans-BMPyP) each have four and two positive
methylpyridine ions, respectively. In the past, our research laboratory
has published studies indicating that the location and the number
of positive methylpyridine ions have an effect on DNA-binding modes
and DNA structural changes (B–Z transition).24,25 This research studied the binding mode of a trans-BMPyP having porphyrins with two positive methylpyridine ions at
ortho-, meta-, and para-positions (referred to as o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP, Scheme 1)
bound with DNA and compared it with the binding mode of meso-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrins (TMPyP) with four positive
methylpyridine ions.

Results
Absorption
In general, red shift and hypochromicity
in absorption spectra are presented because of the interactions between
DNA and small molecules. On the basis of the degree to which they
change, binding modes can be predicted. Figure 1 presents the measured absorption spectra
of various bindings between o-, m-, p-trans-BMPyP and DNA at various
concentration ratios (R = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08,
and 0.1), and their measurements were presented in each of the (A–C)
panels. Panel (A) presents the absorption spectra when o-trans-BMPyP binds with DNA. At maximum absorbency
of the DNA-free o-trans-BMPyP and
DNA binding at ∼415 nm, an approximately 4 nm red shift to
∼419 nm occurred. Absorbency was also found to gradually decrease
as the concentration increased resulting in hypochromicity. At the
highest concentration ratio (R = 0.1), absorbency
decreased by 39.71% compared to the DNA-free o-trans-BMPyP. Panel (B) presents the results of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA. The panel also presented red
shifts and hypochromicity as was the case with o-trans-BMPyP–DNA. However, the results of panel (B)
indicated greater hypochromicity (57.45%) and a larger red shift (∼10
nm) of 10 nm from ∼416 to ∼426 nm compared to o-trans-BMPyP to DNA as the concentration
ratios increased. Alongside the increases in the concentration ratios,
small movements toward shorter wavelengths were observed at ∼428
nm. Also, an isosbestic point was observed at ∼422 nm. Although
absorbency at ∼428 nm decreased in small amounts as the concentration
ratios increased, absorbency was found to increase in small amounts
at the newly formed ∼413 nm. This indicated that the type of
binding of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA
under the experiment conditions of this study may be different, that m-trans-BMPyP that did not bind may exist,
or that this may be indicative of an interaction with m-trans-BMPyP after the final binding. Lastly, panel
(C) presents absorption regarding p-trans-BMPyP–DNA. Like other porphyrins, red shift (∼4 nm)
and hypochromicity (∼42.92%) were observed. Similar to m-trans-BMPyP, on the basis of the concentration,
the wavelengths of maximum absorbency indicated movement. However,
no changes in the absorbency were presented. At lower concentration
ratios (R = 0.02) of binding p-trans-BMPyP to DNA, red shift of approximately ∼7
nm occurred from ∼419 to ∼426 nm, and as the concentration
increased, wavelengths moved again to shorter wavelengths (∼422
nm).

with DNA at various mixing ratios in the presence of DNA (black curve)
and in the absence of DNA (red curve). [DNA] = 100 μM, R = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1. The ratio is increasing
with the direction of the arrow.

Circular Dichroism Spectra
Circular dichroism (CD)
spectra are strong indicators used to easily distinguish the binding
modes of porphyrins bound to DNA. Porphyrins are not chiral molecules.
However, when bound to DNA, CD spectra induced by DNA can be observed
in the Soret band of the porphyrin absorption spectrum, and through
this CD spectrum, the binding modes of porphyrin bound to DNA can
be distinguished.18−23Figure 2 presents
the CD spectra measured at various concentration ratios (R = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1) of o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP
bound to DNA. As was the case with absorption, the results were presented
through panels (A–C). Panel (A) presents the CD spectral analysis
results regarding o-trans-BMPyP
to DNA. When examining the DNA-induced porphyrin spectrum, the Soret
spectrum, one positive peak was observed from the ∼427 nm wavelength
at low concentration ratios (0.02–0.04). On the other hand,
as the concentration ratios increased, at wavelengths of ∼413
and ∼427 nm, a bisignate signal of a negative peak and a positive
peak, respectively, was observed. The ratio of the size of the bisignate
peak was not symmetrically the same, and at the highest concentration
ratio (R = 0.1), the positive peak was observed to
be 2.86 greater in size than the negative peak. These results indicated
that at low concentration ratios, a monomeric-binding mode was present
in which binding occurs occasionally on the DNA grooves, and as the
concentration ratios increase, outside stacking as a result of interactions
with DNA phosphate groups or binding mode stacking along the DNA minor
grooves was presented. Unlike this case, when m-trans-BMPyP binds to the DNA, negative peaks across the
CD spectra at all concentration ratios were observed. Panel (B) indicates
that at a low concentration ratio (R = 0.02), one
negative peak at ∼440 nm and two negative peaks at ∼419
and ∼440 nm were observed, respectively, as the concentration
increased, and their values were also found to increase gradually.
However, at the maximum concentration ratio (R =
0.1), compared to the absorption peak at ∼440 nm, the absorption
peak at ∼419 nm was observed to be 2.30 times lower. Such a
phenomenon can be considered to be the result of the following two
explanations. First, as it is widely known, the result of insertion
into the DNA base pairs results in observations of negative peaks,
and the occurrence of another negative peak can be explained by the
interactions between the porphyrins inserted into the base pairs.18−23 Second, CT-DNA incorporates a GC base of ∼60% and an AT base
of ∼40%. This indicates that it could be the result of binding
affinities associated with GC or AT. The results of the CD spectral
analysis of p-trans-BMPyP to DNA
were presented in panel (C). Similar to o-trans-BMPyP to DNA, with the exception of a low concentration
ratio (R = 0.02), bisignate signals were observed
and the positions shifted slightly to long wavelengths presenting
a negative peak at ∼418 nm and a positive peak at ∼437
nm. However, unlike o-trans-BMPyP
to DNA, the size of the bisignate signal was presented to be almost
symmetrical. This indicated that it had a similar binding mode to o-trans-BMPyP to DNA or had better DNA
stacking.

Figure 2 CD spectra of (A) o-, (B) m-,
and (C) p-trans-BMPyP complexed
with DNA at various mixing ratios. The conditions and ratios are the
same as in Figure 1. The ratio is increasing with the direction of the arrow.

Linear Dichroism and LDr
Figure 3 presents the linear dichroism
(LD) spectra of o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP bound with DNA at various
concentration ratios. The measurements were each presented, respectively,
in panels (A–C). Although the changes in DNA absorption spectra
as the concentration increased when binding o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP
to DNA were similar, some differences were observed in the porphyrin
absorption spectra between ∼400 and ∼500 nm. Compared
to porphyrin-free DNA, all instances of o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP
to DNA presented a tendency in which the DNA absorption spectra decreased
as the concentration ratios increased. The reason behind such decrease
can be attributed to an increase in positive contributions of porphyrins
bound to DNA, a decrease in DNA orientation ability due to the porphyrin
binding, or the result of both. Panel (A) presents the LD spectral
analysis results regarding o-trans-BMPyP to DNA. Negative peaks of the porphyrin absorption spectra
were observed at ∼425 nm when the concentration ratio of o-trans-BMPyP to DNA was low (R = 0.02–0.04), and LD sizes indicated slight increases. Beginning
at the concentration ratio of 0.06, bisignate peaks were formed. At
the concentration ratio of 0.06 and ∼410 nm, positive peaks
began to form, LD sizes gradually increased with increase in the concentration
ratio, and gradually increased even at negative absorption spectra
(∼425 nm). However, as the concentration ratio increased (more
than R = 0.08), the LD signal of the negative peaks
shifted to long wavelengths at ∼430 nm (R =
0.08) and ∼436 nm (R = 0.1) while LD values
decreased. Unlike this instance, the porphyrin absorption spectrum
of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA did not
present wavelength shifts based on different concentration ratios
[panel (B)]. At the lowest concentration ratio (R = 0.02), negative peaks were observed at ∼435 nm, and with
increase in the concentration ratio, bisignate signals were presented.
Positive peaks formed at ∼414 nm and negative peaks formed
at ∼435 nm, and their sizes presented gradual increases. LD
sizes of the negative peaks were approximately 3.2 times larger than
the positive peaks. Lastly, panel (C) presents the LD spectral analysis
of p-trans-BMPyP to DNA. A bisignate
signal was observed with a positive peak at ∼420 nm and a negative
peak at ∼449 nm. Increase of positive peaks was clearly evident
with increase in the concentration ratio while almost no changes were
observed for the negative peaks. The LD sizes indicated the opposite
results of the LD spectral analysis of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA in which large positive peaks were presented.
When o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP bind to DNA, LD signal changes in the
Soret absorption spectrum occur according to concentration ratios.
At low concentration ratios, only one negative peak presented for
all cases. Although sizes changed at different rates as concentration
ratios increased, all cases presented bisignate signals. This was
considered to be the result of interaction with porphyrins bound to
DNA as concentration ratios increased or the result of the respective
difference in interactions with AT and GC bases of DNA.

Figure 3 LD spectra
of (A) o-, (B) m-,
and (C) p-trans-BMPyP complexed
with DNA at various mixing ratios. The conditions and ratios are the
same as in Figure 1. The ratio is increasing with the direction of the arrow.

By dividing the measured LD spectra
by the absorption spectra,
LDr spectra can be found. Figure 4 presents the LDr spectra of o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP to DNA at various concentration ratios, and
the results are presented in panels (A–C). In the DNA absorption
spectra, the size of LDr decreased more with the binding
of porphyrins than without the binding of porphyrins. This can be
considered to be the result of the increase in DNA flexibility induced
by the binding of porphyrins, the result of the bending of the DNA
stem, or the result of both. LDr calculates the angles
between the bound molecules with the DNA helix axis, when small molecules
bind with DNA and through the use of such calculations, LDr is considered to be the most useful tool used to predict binding
modes. In general, binding modes can be predicted by comparing the
LDr sizes of the DNA spectra and drug spectra.20−22,24 That is, when comparing the LDr sizes of DNA absorption spectra, should the LDr sizes of the drug spectra be similar or larger to the DNA spectra,
the area in which the DNA helix axis and drug DNA interact indicates
insertion into the DNA base pair. LDr values having larger
positive contribution compared to the DNA spectra can be considered
to be indicative not of insertion modes but of groove binding or the
result of outside-binding modes due to interaction with DNA phosphates.
When examining the porphyrin absorption spectra, larger positive contributions
and concentration ratios for o- and p-trans-BMPyP to DNA compared to m-trans-BMPyP to DNA result in decreases in LDr sizes and positive values. Positive LDr values
were even observed at low concentration ratios in the case of p-trans-BMPyP to DNA. These results, as
is the case with CD spectra, indicate outside-binding modes associated
with binding along DNA phosphates or the binding of o- and p-trans-BMPyP with DNA grooves,
resulting from the interaction between o- and p-trans-BMPyP and DNA. Unlike this, in
the case of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA,
the LDr of the DNA absorption spectra and the Soret absorption
spectra presented differences at low concentration ratios (R = 0.02 and 0.04). However, even with increases in concentration
ratios, LDr values did not change at the Soret absorption
spectrum at ∼427 nm, and the higher the concentration ratios,
compared to the LDr values of the DNA absorption spectra,
the LDr values of the Soret absorption spectra were found
to be smaller or similar. From the results of the LDr spectral
analysis, at low concentration ratios, binding can be said to have
occurred at the DNA grooves or phosphates, whereas at high concentration
ratios, the molecular surface of m-trans-BMPyP and the DNA helix axis were almost perpendicular, which was
indicative of insertion into the DNA base pair. However, all concentration
ratios of CD spectra indicated negative values at the Soret band,
the m-trans-BMPyP absorption spectra.
This indicated that even at low concentration ratios, m-trans-BMPyP was inserted into the DNA base pairs.
Therefore, the reason behind the differences in LDr values
at low concentration ratios was considered to be due to the binding
of one of the porphyrin electric transition moments, Bx or By, at the DNA base
surface in the horizontal direction, when the molecular surface of m-trans-BMPyP is inserted into the DNA
base pair, whereas on the other hand, the other transition is tilted
toward the DNA helix axis. That is, the molecular surface of m-trans-BMPyP was considered to have largely
tilted within the intercalation pocket.

are the same as in Figure 1. The ratio is increasing with the direction of the arrow.

Discussion
For
the purpose of reaching conclusions regarding DNA-binding modes
based on positions of periphery cationic methylpyridine ions of cationic
porphyrins (o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP) and for the purpose of understanding
the effects of binding modes based on the number of periphery cationic
methylpyridine ions, the spectroscopic properties of DNA-binding modes
of o-, m-, and p-TMPyP having four periphery cationic methylpyridine ions were studied
and compared. All spectra were measured at a concentration ratio of
0.1 (Figures 5–7).

Binding Mode of o-trans-BMPyP
to DNA
In general, when porphyrins are inserted into DNA
base pairs, large red shifts of the absorption spectra occur, negative
CD spectra including hypochromicity are observed, and the porphyrin
LDr sizes or values compared to the LDr sizes
and values of the DNA absorption spectrum are larger or have larger
values. However, when o-trans-BMPyP
binds with DNA, unlike the insertion mode, small red shifts, hypochromicity,
bisignate bands in the Soret absorption spectra, and largely reduced
LDr of the Soret absorption spectra compared to the DNA
absorption spectra can be observed. This results in the proposal of
two possible binding modes due to the interaction between o-trans-BMPyP and DNA. This can be considered
to be the result of groove binding between o-trans-BMPyP and DNA or outside binding between o-trans-BMPyP and DNA phosphate groups. Also, to
compare the effects of the binding modes based on the number of periphery
cationic methylpyridine ions of the cationic porphyrins, the results
of absorption, CD, and LDr spectra analyses regarding the
binding of DNA with o-TMPyP having four periphery
cationic methylpyridine ions are presented in Figure 5.

As was the case with o-trans-BMPyP to DNA, the absorption spectra of o-TMPyP to DNA compared to o-trans-BMPyP to DNA indicated smaller changes, yet, red shifts and hypochromicity
could be observed, and regarding the LDr spectra, the size
of LDr in the Soret absorption spectra compared to the
DNA absorption spectra was found to be especially smaller. However,
significant differences were present in the CD analysis. Maintaining
molecular planarity of porphyrins is difficult for cationic porphyrins
having periphery cationic methylpyridines at the ortho-position because
of the difficulties in rotating due to steric hindrance. Because of
the influence of such structural properties, o-trans-BMPyP and o-TMPyP are both difficult
to insert into DNA base pairs and need to resort to groove binding
or DNA outside binding through interactions with DNA phosphates. Such
predicted binding modes show clear differences in binding modes based
on the number of periphery cationic methylpyridine ions of the cationic
porphyrins. Unlike the observed bisignate bands in o-trans-BMPyP to DNA having two periphery cationic
methylpyridine ions in the Soret absorption spectra, a positive band
can be observed, when o-TMPyP having four periphery
cationic methylpyridine ions binds with DNA. In other words, o-TMPyP having four periphery cationic methylpyridine ions
bind with the outside of DNA and o-trans-BMPyP having two ions bind through a moderate stacking binding mode
by binding to grooves. These results indicate greater steric hindrance
with larger numbers of periphery cationic methylpyridine ions at the
ortho-position, resulting in porphyrin structures that are far from
planarity. Such results are indicative of DNA outside binding because
of the difficulties of groove binding.

Binding Mode of p-trans-BMPyP
to DNA
Figure 6 presents the absorption, CD, and LDr spectra, when p-trans-BMPyP and p-TMPyP
bind with DNA. Both p-trans-BMPyP
and p-TMPyP to DNA present large hypochromicity,
where p-TMPyP to DNA presents a larger red shift
compared to p-trans-BMPyP to DNA
(Figure 6A). In the
CD spectrum, both p-trans-BMPyP
and p-TMPyP to DNA indicate bisignate bands in the
Soret absorption spectrum. Although p-trans-BMPyP to DNA presents symmetrical similarities between the CD sizes
of the negative and positive absorption bands, the size of the negative
bands compared to the positive bands of p-TMPyP to
DNA was found to be approximately 3 times larger (Figure 6B). Figure 6C presents the LDr spectra of p-trans-BMPyP and p-TMPyP
to DNA. An examination of the DNA absorption spectrum indicates a
decrease in the p-trans-BMPyP to
DNA LDr size compared to when porphyrins are not present,
whereas the LDr size of p-TMPyP to DNA,
on the other hand, was found to slightly increase. This indicated
a change in the DNA length due to the binding of porphyrins. When
comparing LDr sizes of the Soret absorption spectra and
the DNA absorption spectra in p-trans-BMPyP to DNA and p-TMPyP to DNA, compared to the
LDr of the DNA absorption spectrum of p-trans-BMPyP to DNA, the LDr size of
the Soret absorption spectrum decreased and presented a positive value.
However, compared to p-TMPyP to DNA, the LDr size of the Soret absorption spectrum was found to be almost the
same as the DNA absorption spectrum. Although such results indicated
that the p-TMPyP molecule bound to the DNA helix
axis almost perpendicularly, that is, indicated a binding mode to
the DNA base pair, this also indicated that p-trans-BMPyP was not inserted into the DNA base pairs but
rather bound through DNA groove binding or DNA outside binding. Regardless
of whether the periphery cationic methylpyridine ions of the cationic
porphyrins were in the same position, there were differences in binding
modes to DNA. This can be considered to be indicative of the fact
that DNA binding modes are largely affected by the number of periphery
cationic methylpyridine ions at the para-position of porphyrins.

Binding Mode of m-trans-BMPyP
to DNA
Figure 7 presents the absorption, CD and LDr spectra when m-trans-BMPyP and m-TMPyP
bind with DNA. In the absorption spectrum, both the m-trans-BMPyP and m-TMPyP porphyrins
indicated large red shifts and hypochromicity, when binding with DNA
where larger red shifts were presented in the case of m-TMPyP to DNA. In the CD spectrum, negative bands were observed in
the Soret absorption spectrum and the CD size value of m-TMPyP to DNA was approximately 2.5 times greater than m-trans-BMPyP to DNA. Such negative CD values in
the Soret absorption spectrum are typical of binding modes, in which
porphyrins have been inserted into DNA base pairs. In support of this
fact, a study of the LDr spectrum indicated the differences
in DNA absorption spectrum LDr sizes compared to when porphyrins
do not exist as was the case with p-trans-BMPyP and p-TMPyP to DNA. This also indicated a
change in the DNA length due to the binding of porphyrins. An examination
of LDr sizes of DNA absorption spectra and Soret absorption
spectra of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA
and m-TMPyP to DNA indicated similar values in the
case of m-trans-BMPyP to DNA, whereas
a notably larger negative value was present in the case of m-TMPyP to DNA. This, as was mentioned earlier, indicated
that the porphyrin molecule was perpendicularly close to the DNA helix
axis and that the porphyrin was inserted into the DNA base pair. On
the other hand, the molecular surface of m-trans-BMPyP during the insertion into the DNA base pair
was thought to have largely tilted in the intercalation pocket. On
the basis of the number of periphery cationic methylpyridine ions,
the para-position of cationic porphyrins indicated different binding
modes to DNA, whereas in the meta-position, both porphyrins having
two or four periphery cationic methylpyridine ions were bound to the
DNA base pairs through insertion binding modes. Therefore, changes
in the number of periphery cationic methylpyridine ions at the meta-position
were found to have no effect on DNA binding modes.

and p-trans-BMPyP bound to DNA.

Conclusions
On
the basis of the observations reported, it is conclusive that m-trans-BMPyP exhibited an intercalative
binding mode to native DNA, whereas the other two, that is, o- and
p-isomers were not. In the latter two porphyrin cases, the porphyrin
produced the spectral characteristics supporting either minor or major
groove binding mode, in which one of the electric transition moments
(either Bx or By transition) tilts the angle of the groove with respect to
the local DNA helix axis (Figure 8).

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
o-, m-, and p-trans-BMPyP
and o-, m-, and p-TMPyP were purchased from Frontier Scientific, Inc. (Utah, USA)
and used as received. DNA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification. Buffer solution used was 5 mM cacodylate
buffer and pH 7.0. The concentrations of the porphyrins were measured
spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficients of ε415nm = 233 960 cm–1 M–1, ε418nm = 252 400 cm–1 M–1, and ε419nm = 240 000
cm–1 M–1 for o-trans-BMPyP, m-trans-BMPyP, and p-trans-BMPyP and ε413nm = 239 000 cm–1 M–1, ε417nm = 278 000 cm–1 M–1, and ε421nm = 226 000
cm–1 M–1 for o-TMPyP, m-TMPyP, and p-TMPyP, respectively.
The extinction coefficients for DNA was ε258nm =
6700 cm–1 M–1. Absorption and
CD spectra were recorded at room temperature, on a Cary 100 Bio spectrophotometer
(Australia) and on a JASCO J810 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan),
respectively. The path length for all CD measurements was 1 cm. LD
spectra were measured on J715 (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) spectropolarimeters.
A Wada-type inner-rotating flow cell was used to align the DNA sample
for LD measurements, as described by Norden et al.26,27 The division of measured LD by the isotropic absorption spectrum
resulted in a dimensionless quantity LDr, which is related
to the angle (α) of the transition moment of any DNA-bound drug
with respect to the local DNA helix axis and the ability to orient
the DNA–drug adduct through  where S is the orientation
factor, a measure of the sample’s ability to orient. The mixing
ratio R, [porphyrin]/[DNA base], corresponded to
the ratio of one porphyrin per polynucleotide bases, where R = 0.01 corresponded to one porphyrin per 100 DNA bases
or phosphates.
