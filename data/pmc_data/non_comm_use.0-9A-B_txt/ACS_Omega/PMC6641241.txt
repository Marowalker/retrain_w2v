Rationally
designing efficient and low-price bifunctional electrocatalysts
for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) are vitally important to bring solar/electrical-to-hydrogen
energy conversion processes into reality. Herein, we report on a synthetic
method that leads to an in situ growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets and transition metal disulfide nanocubes onto the surface
of Fe1/3Co1/3Ni1/3MoO4 nanorods for the first time. Such hybrids are found to serve as
a bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activities for OER and HER,
as represented by an impressive anodic and cathodic current density
of 10 mA cm–2 at 1.53 and −0.25 V, respectively.
More importantly, the performance for OER is even better than that
of IrO2, the conventional noble metal electrocatalyst.
These striking observations were interpreted in terms of the combination
of strongly synergistic effect of multimetal components, large amount
of exposed active site, and superaerophobia. The present methodology
has been confirmed universal for synthesizing other molybdate solid
solutions, which would open up new possibilities for designing novel
non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and HER.

Introduction
Electrochemical water
splitting is widely considered as a promising
and sustainable route for hydrogen production because electrical energy
can be supplied from renewable energy resources such as wind turbines,
hydropower, photovoltaic cells, and so forth.1−3 Enhancing electrocatalytic
activities of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER), the half reactions of water splitting, is vital for
solving environment and energy issues, particularly for OER.4,5 At present, IrO2 and Pt/C are popularly used as the electrocatalysts
for OER and HER, which however have the demerits such as high cost,
scarcity of noble metals, and monofunction.6,7 All
these drawbacks make both IrO2 and Pt/C unsuitable in wide
applications. Hence, developing bifunctional electrocatalysts with
an attractive price and quality becomes more and more important in
a clean energy field.

Until now, many strategies have been tried
for the development
of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with improved OER and HER
activities. These strategies can be primarily divided into several
categories: the first one is to enhance the synergistic effect between
interfaces in multimetal components.8−10 Zou and co-workers fabricated
Ag/CoxP core–shell heterogeneous
nanoparticles which have shown an excellent OER performance.10 The second one is to increase the number of
active sites.11−13 Xie and co-workers prepared defect-rich MoS2 and Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and achieved significantly improved
HER and OER performances when compared to the defect-poor samples.
The third one is to design superaerophobic electrodes that can accelerate
gas evolution behavior and improve electrocatalytic performance at
high reaction rates.14,15 Jiang and co-workers fabricated
a 3D-nanostructured Cu film for hydrazine fuel cells.14 Given that all these strategies could improve the activity
of OER and HER to some extent, we wonder whether remarkable catalytic
activity can be obtained when we unify all these strategies in a material
system.

Heterostructures, integrating distinct components with
different
functionalities in one system, give a chance to answer the above question
because of their strong synergistic effect. However, most reported
heterostructures were only two components as of now, which is not
enough to settle this problem. Motivated by this, we attempted to
initiate a strategy, in which MoS2 nanosheet arrays and
transition metal disulfide nanocubes (TS2, T = Fe, Co,
and Ni) were grown in situ onto the surface of transition metal molybdate
solid solution. This novel strategy is expected to show merits of
strong synergistic effect, large amount of exposed active sites, and
superaerophobia.

To this end, for the first time, we report
a synthetic method that
leads to a highly efficient MoS2–TS2–transition
metal molybdate electrocatalyst for OER and HER. The obtained material
could be considered as an integrator of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheet
arrays, TS2 nanocubes, and transition metal molybdate solid
solution nanorods. We show that the integrator exhibits a high electrocatalytic
activity toward both OER and HER, thanks to its special composition
and structure. Most notably, by modulating the transition metal composition,
an anodic current density of 10 mA cm–2 at an applied
potential of 1.53 V is achieved, which is better than those of IrO2 and commercial noble metal electrocatalysts. Furthermore,
the catalyst also achieved a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm–2 only at −0.25 V (vs RHE), which is superior
to that of the MoS2 catalyst.

of Materials
All chemical reagents used
were of analytical grade without further treatment.

Synthesis
of 1D Porous TMoO4 (T = Ni, Co, and Fe)
Nanorods
Porous TMoO4 nanorods were synthesized
via pyrolysis of the TMoO4·H2O precursor
in air atmosphere.16 The synthetic procedure
could be briefly described as follows: 3 mmol sodium molybdate was
dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water under vigorous stirring to get
solution A. Transition metal nitrate or sulfate (3 mmol) was dissolved
in 30 mL of deionized water to form solution B. Then, solution B was
dropped into solution A under vigorous stirring. Finally, the resulting
suspension solution was kept for heating at 150 °C for 12 h and
cooled down naturally. The resultant powder was collected after centrifugation
and washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and subsequently
dried at 60 °C. To fabricate TMoO4 nanorods, the dried
powder was moved to an alumina crucible and then heated to 500 °C
at a heating rate of 1 °C/min and maintained at 500 °C for
2 h. The whole procedure was conducted under a constant N2 gas flow to maintain an inert atmosphere. For convenience, the product
was marked as TMO (T = Ni, Co, and Fe). Specific names for samples
are listed in Table 1.

Synthesis of 1D Porous
TMoO4 (T = Ni/Co, Ni/Fe, or
Ni/Co/Fe) Nanorods
The procedure for preparing 1D TMoO4 nanorods was similar to that for TMoO4, except
for solution B of TMoO4 that contained given ratios of
transition metal salts (Ni/Co = 1:1, Ni/Fe = 8:2, and Fe/Co/Ni = 1:1:1).
The obtained sample was named TMO, for example, Ni0.5Co0.5MoO4 was marked as NCMO (see Table 1 for details).

Synthesis
of 1D and 2D Hybrids MoS2/TMO
MoS2/TS2/TMO hybrids were prepared via a simple
low-temperature hydrothermal process. In a typical procedure, 150
mg of TMO or TMO nanorods and certain amount of l-cysteine
(0.12, 0.25, 0.36, and 0.48 g) were dispersed in 60 mL of deionized
water in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave
was heated at 200 °C for 18 h and then naturally cooled to room
temperature. The resulting product was collected by a filter and washed
by deionized water thoroughly. Finally, the black powder was dried
under vacuum. For convenience, the powder was marked as TMS. T symbolizes
transition metal, M is the initial letter of molybdenum, and S represents
sulfidation.

Synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets and
Reference Samples
CoS2 and NiS2
MoS2 nanosheets
were also prepared via a hydrothermal process. In a typical procedure,
1 mmol sodium molybdate and 5 mmol thioacetamide were dissolved in
60 mL of deionized water in a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel
autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 200 °C for 18 h. Reference
samples CoS2 and NiS2 were synthesized using
a similar procedure, except that Co(NO3)2·6H2O or Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was
used to substitute Na2MoO4.

Physical Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku Miniflex apparatus equipped
with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å). Field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectrometer
(EDS) mapping data were performed on JSM-6700F. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements were carried out on Tecnai G2 S-TWIN
F20. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM ) measurements
were performed on JEOL-2100F. Specific surface areas of the samples
were measured with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller equation,
and pore size distributions were calculated via Barrett–Joynet–Halenda
formula by a surface area analyzer ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics). X-ray
absorption fine structure data were collected at the 1W1B station
in Beijing synchrotron radiation facility.

Electrochemical Characterization
In a typical procedure
to prepare the working electrode, each of the sample was dispersed
in 1 mL of mix solution (containing 450 μL of H2O,
500 μL of ethanol, and 50 μL of 5% Nafion) via ultrasonic
dispersion for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous ink. Then, 10 μL
of ink was loaded onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) of 5 mm in
diameter (loading amount: 0.20 mg cm–2). Prior to
the coating of the catalyst, the GCE was polished with an Al2O3 paste (50 nm) and washed ultrasonically with deionized
water. Then, the catalyst-modified GCE was dried at room temperature.

Electrochemical measurements were performed in a typical three-electrode
cell using a CHI 760E workstation at room temperature. OER and HER
were tested under different conditions. For OER, a graphite rod and
Hg/HgO electrode were used as the counter electrode and the reference
electrode, respectively. Linear scan voltammetry (LSV) was carried
out at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 1 M KOH, and all
data were revised by Ohmic potential drop (iR) correction.
The potentials were displayed versus RHE by RHE calibration: E (RHE) = E (Hg/HgO) + 0.098 + 0.059 ×
pH. The stability tests were performed in 1 M KOH at room temperature
by potential cycling between 1.25 and 1.7 V (vs RHE) at a sweep rate
of 50 mV s–1 for 3000 cycles. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) measurements with different scan rates (40, 80, 120, 160, and
200 mV s–1) were used to determine the electrochemical
double layer capacitances (EDLC, Cdl).
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were
carried out at an overpotential of 300 mV in the frequency range of
10–2 105 Hz. Prior to all the above measurements,
oxygen was bubbled into the electrolyte for 30 min.

For HER,
a graphite rod and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were
used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively.
LSV was carried out at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in
0.5 M H2SO4, and all results were revised by iR correction. The potentials were displayed versus RHE
by RHE calibration: E (RHE) = E (SCE)
+ 0.241 + 0.059 × pH. Prior to all the above measurements, nitrogen
was bubbled into the electrolyte for 30 min.

Results and Discussion
MoS2–TS2–TMoOx hybrids were initiated to be prepared via a two-step method
(shown in Figure 1).
In step 1, transition metal molybdate hydrates were pyrolyzed under
an inert atmosphere to release H2O, and then porous transition
metal molybdate nanorods were obtained. In step 2, porous TMO nanorods
were sulfided by l-Cys in a hydrothermal environment. During
the sulfidation procedure, S2– anions dissociated
from l-Cys might react quickly with metal ions (transition
metal or Mo ions) on the surface to form a thin layer metal disulfide.17 This thin layer metal disulfide could play a
key role in obstructing further reaction between inner metal ions
and outside S2–.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration for the preparation
of TMS hybrids via a
two-step method.

By optimizing the experiment
parameter (Figures S1 and S2), we chose to add 0.36 g of l-Cys in the
synthesis of our catalysts. Composition, pore size distributions,
and specific surface area of the as-synthesized samples were measured
by XRD patterns and nitrogen adsorption–desorption (Figures S3 and S4).

SEM images in Figure 2 illustrate the evolution
process from precursors (NCMH, NFMH, and
FCNMH) to the corresponding sulfide samples (NCMS, NFMS, and FCNMS).
After calcinations at 500 °C, NCMO, NFMO, and FCNMO maintained
the nanorod morphology of their precursors, probably due to the slow
heating rate. The diameter of NCMO is about 500–1000 nm, whereas
the diameter for NFMO and FCNMO is about 0.5–2 μm. By
comparing the data in Figure S5, it is
found that sizes of NCMO, NFMO, and FCNMO were clearly larger than
those of CMO and NMO. That is to say, the size of a nanorod can be
tuned by doping a transition metal. Figure 2c,f,i shows the morphologies of NCMS, NFMS,
and FCNMS, respectively. Obviously, after sulfuration, NCMS, NFMS,
and FCNMS still showed a rodlike morphology. Moreover, an ultrathin
nanosheet array and some cubes (white circle in Figure 2c,f,i) were grown onto the surface of molybdate.
It is reasonable that the nanosheet array is MoS2, whereas
the nanocube is TS2 (T = Fe, Co, and Ni), as deduced by
the layered structure characters of MoS2 and cubic phase
structure of TS2. The composition of TS2 was
further verified by STEM and corresponding EDX element mapping (Figure S7).

(f) NFMS, and (i) FCNMS. White cycles in (c,f,i) are assigned to TS2.

The morphology and structure of
FCNMS, NCMS, and NFMS were further
investigated by TEM and HRTEM (Figures 3 and S6). The TEM image
(Figure 3a) shows that
the ultrathin nanosheets were wrapped onto an FCNMO nanorod, showing
a thickness of less than 5 nm, and that the nanocubes have a lateral
size of about 200 nm. Careful data examination indicates that the
nanosheets appeared to be stacked loosely and partially curved. The
edges were approximately about 5–6 layers. The interlayer distance
of nanosheets is about 0.63 nm, which can be indexed to the (002)
plane of MoS2. Further, HRTEM of nanocubes shows a lattice
distance of 0.25 nm, corresponding to the (210) plane of TS2.

Figure 3 (a) TEM and (b,c) HRTEM of FCNMS.

EDS mapping was used to examine the dispersion of elements
for
samples FCNMS, NFMS, and NCMS (Figures 4 and S8). After sulfidation,
S element is evenly dispersed onto the sample surface. Moreover, it
is found that the O element is still uniformly dispersed in the core
of FCNMS, which demonstrates a core–shell structure of FCNMS
(core FCNMO and shell MoS2/TS2). Also as shown
in Figure S8, Co, Ni, Mo, O, S and Ni,
Fe, Mo, O, S were uniformly dispersed on nanorods of NCMS and NFMS,
respectively.

It is worth noting that CMS and
NMS could not maintain the rod
morphology (Figure S5). There are two possible
reasons. First, CMO and NMO nanorods are too thin to maintain the
rodlike morphology. Comparatively, once doping other transition metal
ions into CMO and NMO, such as FCNMO, the nanorods became thicker
(Figures 2 and S5), which may be in favor of maintaining the
rod morphology. Second, doping transition metals may change the exposed
crystal plane of precursors and thus be conducive to epitaxial growth
of MoS2. To verify this, TEM and HRTEM were used to monitor
the exposed plane for FCNMO (Figure 5a,b).

Figure 5 (a) TEM and (b) HRTEM images of FCNMO, (c) schematic diagram
for
the growth mechanism of FCNMS. The gold and blue arrows in (c) mean
that the transition metals (Fe2+, Co2+, and
Ni2+) and molybdate ions in FCNMO were sulfided to TS2 and MoS2, respectively.

TEM analysis in Figure 5a demonstrates the rod characteristic of FCNMO, consistent
with the observations by SEM (Figure 2). The distance between lattice fringes marked in Figure 5b is about 0.67 nm,
corresponding to the plane (001) of monoclinic CoMoO4 (JCPDF
no. 21-0868). Similarly, the lattice distance for NCMO and NFMO was
0.65 nm (Figure S9), very closer to 0.62
nm for the plane (110) of NiMoO4 (JCPDF no. 33-0948). The
measured lattice fringes for three samples NCMO, NFMO, and FCNMO matched
well with that of 0.63 nm for the plane (002) of MoS2 nanosheets
(Figure 3b). Comparatively,
CMO and NMO exhibited a lattice spacing of 0.28 and 0.34 nm, respectively
(Figure S10), which could be assigned to
the planes (201) and (130). Hence, doping transition metals into molybdate
is beneficial for the exposure of planes (001) and (110). Previous
literature has established that the well-matched lattice distance
could facilitate the epitaxial growth of two different materials.18 Accordingly, the mechanism of sulfidation can
be illustrated in Figure 5c. That is, during the sulfidation procedure, S2– anions dissociated from l-Cys may react quickly with surface
Mo atoms to form MoS2 nanosheets. Then, these MoS2 nanosheets would grow along the plane (001) of FCNMO because the
lattice distance of 0.63 nm for the plane (002) of MoS2 is closer to that of 0.67 nm for the plane (001) of FCNMO. On the
other side, a part of transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) would react
with S2– to generate the TS2 nanocubes
on the surface of molybdate.

XANES were measured to examine
the valence states of Mo ions in
FCNMS. As shown in Figure 6a, the absorption edge of FCNMS shifted toward lower energies
relative to that of FCNMO, indicating that partial Mo6+ ions in FCNMO were reduced and reacted with S2– to generate MoS2 nanosheets. The amount of reduced Mo
ions can be estimated by linear combination fitting from Mo K-edge XANES of FCNMS, FCNMO, and MoS2. The data
fit result was shown in Figure S11, where
about 52% of Mo6+ ions were reduced to Mo4+.
Hence, the average valence of Mo ions in FCNMS is about 4.96 (Figure 6b).

Figure 6 (a) Normalized Mo K-edge XANES of FCNMS, FCNMO,
and MoS2 and (b) average valence states of Mo ions in FCNMS,
FCNMO, and MoS2.

Electrocatalytic activity of FCNMS for OER was studied using
a
typical three-electrode electrochemical cell in 1 M KOH. Figure 7a compares their
polarization curves (sample loading was set at 0.2 mg cm–2) with a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. FCNMS and FCNMO
achieved a current density of 10 mA cm–2 (a current
density for 12% efficiency of a solar to fuel conversion device) at
1.53 and 1.56 V, respectively. Further, FCNMS exhibited a large anodic
current density of 206 mA cm–2 at 1.7 V, about 2
times larger than that of FCNMO. Apparently, the catalytic performance
of FCNMO is substantially enhanced after sulfuration. More importantly,
the catalytic activity of FCNMS is even better than that of IrO2, a benchmark noble metal electrocatalyst for OER. Such a
performance observed for FCNMS is also better than the previous reports
for most of the transition metal-based OER catalysts.6,13,19−25

Figure 7 (a)
Polarization curves of given samples for OER; (b) corresponding
Tafel plots derived from (a); (c) EIS Nyquist plots of the given samples
at an overpotential of 320 mV; and (d) initial polarization curves
and after 3000 CV scans for the FCNMS sample. Inset of (d) is the
time-dependent current density curve at a static overpotential of
300 mV.

To understand better the electrocatalytic
performance of the sample
FCNMS, one has to take FCNMO, CoS2, NiS2, mixture
of FCNMO and CoS2, and mixture of FCNMO and NiS2 as the contrast samples. As shown in Figure 7a, the catalytic activity of FCNMS is superior
to that of other samples, indicating the presence of a strong interaction
between TS2 and FCNMO. The data in Figure 7a show that the activities of mixtures of
FCNMO and TS2 (T = Co or Ni), CoS2, and NiS2 do not surpass those of FCNMO. Therefore, it could be reasonable
that the molybdate solid solution plays a dominant role in the catalytic
reaction of the FCNMS composite. In addition, to gain insights into
the oxygen evolution activity, Tafel plots of various catalysts were
compared as shown in Figure 7b. The Tafel slope of FCNMS hybrids is 48 mV dec–1, much closer to the value obtained for IrO2, but apparently lower than those for FCNMO,
CoS2, and NiS2, implying that FCNMS hybrids
can give rise to a high OER rate in practical applications.26,27

The EDLC were measured to compare the active area of electrocatalysts
(Figure S12). The values of Cdl for FCNMS are 3.43 mF cm–2, slightly
larger than those for other samples, which further indicates that
the BET surface area is not a primary factor to catalysis. EIS data
of the samples are comparatively studied, as shown in Figure 7c to understand the electrode
reaction kinetics. The equivalent electric circuit of the cell and
the fitting results are shown in Figure S13 and Table S1, respectively. The larger
semicircle in the low-frequency region corresponds to the electrical
models of the anodes. Rct,2 is related
to the electrocatalytic kinetics, with a smaller value representing
a faster reaction rate.28 The smallest Rct,2 for FCNMS indicates a faster charge transport
among all the studied counterparts.

The long-term stability
of the electrocatalysts is also a critical
factor for applications in practical devices. Accordingly, the stability
of FCNMS-modified electrodes was tested by continuous cycling for
3000 cycles (Figure 7d). After cycling for 3000 times, the polarization curve was slightly
decreased in the anodic current. Although the overpotential at about
10 mA cm–2 was slightly increased from 300 to 318
mV, FCNMS still achieved a current density of 187 mA cm–2 at 1.7 V (vs RHE), and about 91% activity was maintained. Additionally,
the current–time plots at a fixed potential were also collected,
and the anodic current almost maintained a constant value around 10
mA cm–2 over 10 h, further confirming an excellent
stability of the FCNMS-modified electrode.

Meanwhile, the effect
of catalyst loading on the OER activity was
examined (Figure S14), which indicated
that the measured activities were in the regime of intrinsic kinetics.
The above results clearly demonstrate that FCNMS possesses an excellent
catalytic performance for OER. This observation could be attributed
to their distinctive structural advantages: (i) the synergistic effect
of multimetal components and strong interaction between FCNMO and
TS2 in FCNMS, (ii) the mesoporous structure of FCNMS gives
more active sites for the catalytic reaction, as reported elsewhere;20,29,30 and (iii) the nanosheet array
on the surface of nanorods is suitable for desorption of the gas products,
thus giving a much improved electrocatalytic performance.14 It is worth noting that NFMS and NCMS (the vulcanized
products of NFMO and NCMO) also exhibited a distinctly improved OER
activity (as shown in Figure S15). To further
illustrate the advantage of our catalysts, we compared the overpotentials
of FCNMS and NFMS at 10 mA cm–2 with the overpotential
of the recently reported electrocatalyst (as shown in Figure S16). FCNMS has shown the lowest overpotential,
demonstrating a best OER performance.

In addition to the marvelous
OER activity, FCNMS has a possibility
to show good catalytic activity for HER because a large amount of
MoS2 have exposure edges that could become the active sites
for HER. Figure 8a
exhibits the polarization curves of various samples for HER. All the
vulcanized samples exhibit a better HER activity than MoS2. Especially, FCNMS achieved a cathode current density of 10 mA cm–2 at −0.25 V (vs RHE), superior to that of other
samples. Moreover, FCNMS also shows the smallest Tafel slope of 74
mV dec–1 among all samples, indicating the fastest
HER rate.7

Tafel plots derived from (a).

Conclusions
In summary, a universal synthetic route has
been reported for in
situ growth of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheet arrays and transition
metal disulfide nanocubes onto the surface of molybdate solid solutions.
Such MoS2–TS2–TMoOx hybrids have shown merits of strong synergistic
effect among components, mesoporous property, and superaerophobia.
These merits allow these hybrids to show an impressive anodic and
cathodic current density of 10 mA cm–2 at 1.53 and
−0.25 V (vs RHE), respectively. The findings reported in this
work mark an important step toward the development of non-noble metal
electrocatalysts for OER and HER with high efficiency.
