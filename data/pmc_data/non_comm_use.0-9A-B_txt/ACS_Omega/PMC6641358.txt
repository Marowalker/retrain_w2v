The
excess of mango peels is considered manufacturing waste in
the sugar and juice industry. There is an increasing interest in looking
for alternative ways to employ this waste to address this overload.
Here, we show the efficient use of mango peels as a noncost carbon
source for the synthesis of graphene. We demonstrate for the first
time the synthesis of graphene on Cu substrates from mango peels,
a biomass rich in pectin. It is observed that plasma presence is essential
for the growth of graphene from mango peels. At 15 and 30 min of plasma
exposure, we observed the presence of multilayered graphene, at longer
plasma exposure, i.e., 60 min, there is the formation of monolayer
graphene, attributed to the etching of multiple layers formed at short
times due to long plasma exposure time. When employing this technique,
precautions must be taken due to the etching effect of plasma, such
as reducing either the plasma exposure time or the plasma power. Finally,
we present a graphene growth pathway under plasma environment on the
basis of our experimental observations.

Introduction
Pectin-rich
biomass is considered as an under-utilized waste product
of the sugar and juice industry; however, recently, they have gained
attention as feedstock for the synthesis of high-value chemicals,
especially liquid fuels.1,2 Mango puree, slices
in sirup, nectar, canned juices, and preserves are the main industrial
products obtained from mango fruit. The major byproduct is peels and
represents around 24% of the total weight of the fruit.3

Mango peel is a biomass rich in pectin
that also contains cellulose,
hemicellulose, lipids, protein, and enzymes.4−6 Mexico, as one
of the top five countries that produces, exports, and imports mango,7,8 produces an excessive amount of this waste product. The mango peels
that are mainly considered industrial waste are either employed for
compost or sold at a low value as animal feed.9 Hence, there is a necessity to alleviate the accumulation of mango
peels in several regions of Mexico.

Herein, we demonstrate for
the first time the feasibility of producing
graphene as a high-value material from mango peels using plasma. Graphene
is an allotropic form of carbon. The structure of graphene is formed
by six-membered carbon rings connected to each other. Each carbon
atom is in sp2 hybridization state10 and shares σ-bond (s, px, and
py) with three adjacent carbon atoms and
one π-bond in the pz orbital above
the two-dimensional (2D) structural plane.11 The C–C bond length is 1.41 Å, with a bond angle of
120° in its structure.12 Graphene
sheets have found multiple uses, such as catalyst,13−19 semiconductor,20 light-emitting diodes,21 supercapacitors,22 lithium-ion batteries,23 sensors,24 and water treatment.25 Graphene exhibits a surface area higher than 2500 m2 g–1,26 which is at least thrice
the amount of any other allotrope of carbon. Furthermore, graphene’s
unique optoelectrical properties are a result of its zero band gap,27 which makes it extremely useful in sensors,
LEDs, transistors, and other electrical devices. As for any material,
a clear specification is paramount to a successful material application.
For our purposes, it is important to distinguish between single-layer
and multilayer graphene. Both of these types of graphene have very
different properties. Unlike single-layer graphene, multilayer graphene
does not have zero band gap, which makes it more suitable for semiconductor
applications.28 Furthermore, multilayer
graphene provides better corrosion resistance.29 For the case of single-layer graphene, the electron mobility
increases at lower temperatures, making it a better superconductor.30

Typically, the growth of graphene has
been performed with thermal
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by catalytic dehydrogenation of carbon
precursors, most commonly by methane on copper.27 However, this technique is limited by the need of high
temperatures (≈1000 °C) and in many cases, multiple processing
steps. In a conventional CVD process, the time needed to obtain a
high-quality graphene layer synthesized from biomass can take as long
as 24 h.31

A promising approach for
fast graphene synthesis at lower temperatures
is the combined use of a metal such as Cu and plasma (“plasma-enhanced
CVD” or PE-CVD). Plasma provides a rich gas chemistry environment
that includes radicals, ions, and molecules from a simple carbon–hydrogen
source, allowing a faster growth at lower temperatures. The plasma
catalysis approach not only leads to the growth of high-quality graphene
at low temperatures32,33 (<400 °C) but also is
simpler by allowing a “one pot” synthesis by the in
situ removal of native metal oxides due to the presence of hydrogen
plasma. Furthermore, the plasma catalysis technique offers the advantage
of ultrafast deposition, reducing the process time to a few minutes
when using a simple carbon source such as methane, compared to that
in the traditional CVD approach.32−34Table 1 summarizes the efforts done up to date for
the synthesis of graphene using plasma. As can be observed, the main
source of carbon employed is methane and the most common plasma discharges
are microwave and radio frequency. In the proposed synthesis method,
we employed Cu as the substrate because it can be observed in Table 1 as the most common
substrate employed for the synthesis of graphene. Besides, it is cheaper
compared to other employed substrates such as Ni. Furthermore, the
solubility of carbon in Ni is higher compared to that of Cu,35 which requires very specific reaction conditions.

Several efforts
have been made using different sources of carbon.
However, to the best of our knowledge, none were with the use of plasma.
Among the different sources of carbon employed up to date are recycling
waste plastic,49 cookie, chocolate, grass,
plastic, dog feces and cockroach leg,31 and waste chicken fat,50 mostly performed
by CVD at temperatures ranging from 1020 to 1080 °C. Graphene
has also been prepared from chemical treatment and combustion of rice
husk without any substrate.51,52 The use of mango (Mangifera indica) leaves has been reported for the
synthesis of graphene quantum dots (QDs). The preparation of QDs was
performed by treatment of extract obtained from tiny pieces of leaves
stirred in ethanol. The conversion to QDs took place in a microwave
oven at 900 W in a time-span of 5 min.53 However, the use of mango peels as a cheap source of carbon has
not been explored yet. Herein, we demonstrate the successful synthesis
of graphene from mango peels via plasma. To our best knowledge, this
is the first time that graphene is obtained from this kind of biomass
when using plasma.

Characterization
Raman spectroscopy
was performed on
graphene with a WiTec Alpha Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscope
equipped with a 514 nm laser.

The thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed on a Perkin Elmer Pyris 1 Thermogravimetric Analyzer,
with the temperature ramp of 25 °C min–1 from
50 to 750 °C (reaction temperature) and a hold time of 12 min
at 750 °C. The analysis was performed in a helium flow of 60
mL min–1.

The morphology of these materials
was studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The samples were prepared by dispersing
them on 300 mesh lacey carbon copper-supported TEM grids and then
were studied using a field emission gun FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope
operated at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Results and Discussion
The TGA analysis of the mango peel M. indica L., type kent, and reference pectin (from citrus, VWR) is shown
in Figure 1. Figure 1a,b shows the commercial
pure pectin (from citrus, VWR) thermogravimetric analysis for comparison
purposes. As mentioned before, mango peels have several components,
such as lignocellulosic structures (cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignin) and pectin. The mango peel (M. indica L.), type kent, is considered a biomass rich in pectin (>12%
dry
base21). Figure 1c,d shows the TGA analysis for the mango
peels. It is possible to observe an initial decomposition at around
100 °C, which is due to the water evaporation. Then, there is
a second important weight loss at around 200 °C that can be attributed
to the pectin because it is the less thermally stable polysaccharide.
Furthermore, there is a weight reduction trend attributed to the cellulose
and hemicellulose depolymerization54−56 [cellulose at 364 °C,
(see Figure S1, Supporting Information)
and hemicellulose at 320–340 °C57].

(b) temperature vs derivative. TGA analysis for mango peels: (c) temperature
vs mass % and (d) temperature vs derivative.

To investigate the synthesized graphene samples, we performed
Raman
analysis. The Raman spectra of all of the graphene-supported copper
samples is shown in Figure 2. First, it is important to notice that during the 15 min
of pretreatment at 750 °C with no plasma, i.e., the 0 min plasma
sample, there is no graphene formation and only amorphous carbon is
detected.58 Furthermore, none of the samples
show any C–O or C=O vibration bands, which is the evidence
of no oxygen present in the film. The mass of the substrate before
and after the reaction was almost identical, which points toward etching
or removal of most carbon by carrier gas during the plasma growth.
It is postulated that the hydrogen content in the gas phase plays
the dual role of an etchant as well as a reducing agent for the biomass.
Argon merely behaves as a carrier. However, the presence of Argon
in high concentration is necessary. If the ion density of hydrogen
radicals is high, then there will be a competing reaction between
adsorption of hydrogen35,59−62 and carbon deposition in the
voids on the substrate surface. The signature peaks of graphene are
the G and 2D (conventionally known as G′ band) presented at
1580 and 2690–2700 cm–1, respectively, in
our case. These two bands together are the characteristic of sp2-hybridized carbon. The G peak is a result of first-order
Raman scattering, whereas the 2D peak is a result of second order,
i.e., two symmetrical phonons (K and K′) that contribute to
the double resonance process. The G band is a Raman-allowed first-order
frequency. The D-band at 1343–1347 cm–1 along
with D′ band, which can be defined as a shoulder of D band,
is a result of disorientations, disorder, and defects in the graphene
structure.58,63,64

Figure 2 Raman
spectra of graphene samples as a function of the plasma exposure
time (a) 0 min, (b) 5 min, (c) 15 min, (d) 30 min, and (e) 60 min.

Figure 2a shows
the Raman analysis for the sample that was not exposed to plasma.
For this sample, the D and G bands are very short but are visible,
whereas the 2D peak is absent, indicating that the carbon is present
in amorphous phase,61 which is well in
agreement with the high background noise. The D-peak that is attributed
to disorder and defects clearly reduces from 5 to 30 min of plasma
exposure. Then, it seems to remain constant after 30 min of plasma
exposure. This can be attributed to the growth kinetics. We hypothesized
that as the time progresses from 5 to 30 min, individual nucleation
islands begin to interconnect, leading to a reduction of defects and
disorientations. The G-band peak shape changes with time too, which
is an indication of structure formation. At 5 min of plasma treatment
(Figure 2b), it is
possible to distinguish the presence of G and D′ bands but
as the time of plasma exposure increases, the G band increases, whereas
the D′ band is almost indistinguishable, which points out a
reduction in disorientation as the synthesis time increases. Finally,
the evolution of the 2D band is very evident with the increase in
plasma exposure time (Figure 2b–e). This can be explained by the interconnection
of individual islands after 30 min, leading to the formation of a
continuous coverage, hence increasing the intensity of the 2D band
greatly.

The intensity ratios of the D and G band can shed some
light about
the defects in graphene, whereas the intensity ratio of 2D and G bands
can give important information about the number of layers in the sample.65,66 The intensity ratio ID/IG was calculated on the basis of peaks’ heights,
whereas for I2D/IG, it was calculated on the basis of the peak areas using Origin
Pro (Figure 3). In
this case, two different approaches were employed due to the presence
of the G(D′) shoulder. The intensity ratio ID/IG agrees to the aforementioned
explanation of growth kinetics. As the treatment time increases, the
defects decrease due to nucleation and then joining of the individual
nucleation islands. More interestingly, the I2D/IG ratio provides a deep insight
for understanding the growth kinetics at a later phase. At 5 min,
the peak ratio I2D/IG is nearly 1.16, which is the ratio for double-layer graphene.
From 5 to 15 min, the formation of nucleation islands seems to take
place. After 15 min, the nucleation islands start getting connected
through the surface and form a few layers of graphene. With further
increase in the plasma exposure time, the layers of graphene start
getting etched by the high density of hydrogen radicals due to the
plasma presence. The effect of C etching by H atoms in plasma has
been observed either at longer exposure times or at very high plasma
powers.47 At 60 min, the intensity ratio I2D/IG is 2.78, which
points toward the formation of single-layer graphene from few-layer
graphene.58,61−63,65 In the plasma process presented here, it is clear that multiple
graphene layers are generated at first and then get etched by the
high concentration of atomic hydrogen from plasma, leading to single-layer
graphene as the plasma exposure time increases.

Figure 3 Evolution of peak ratios ID/IG and I2D/IG with plasma
exposure time.

The morphology of the
synthesized graphene was studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the image for 5 min plasma exposure, which
corresponds to the peak ratio I2D/IG ∼ 1.16 for double-layer graphene. Figure 4b shows the TEM image
for the sample exposed 15 min to plasma. This image shows an increase
of graphene layers with respect to the 5 min plasma exposure sample.
In Figure 4b, several
graphene layers are overlapping each other. The presence of few layers
of graphene was also confirmed by the Raman peak intensity ratio. Figure 4c shows the sample
exposed for 30 min to plasma. Here, the layers of graphene have decreased
as the treatment time increased from 15 to 30 min, making visible
the fact that etching due to the presence of hydrogen atoms is becoming
important with increase in plasma exposure time and it is overcoming
the graphene deposition. In Figure 4d, a single-layer graphene is visible with some dark
zones. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of single-layered
graphene (intensity ratio I2D/IG ∼ 2.78). The dark zones in this sample
can be attributed to the wrinkles formed during the transfer of graphene
from the copper substrate to the TEM grids.

Figure 4 HRTEM images for synthesized
graphene using different plasma exposure
times: (a) 5 min, (b) 15 min, (c) 30 min, and (d) 60 min.

It is observed from our experiments that 60 min
of plasma exposure
time yields to a monolayer graphene. The conclusion is drawn from
the intensity ratio obtained from the analysis of Raman spectra (Figure 3).

Compared
to the conventional CVD process, in the plasma synthesis
approach, the gas is in the ionized state with much higher ion density,
which leads to faster reactions.67 Also,
it has been reported that the localized ion and electron temperatures
in plasma are higher than 1350 K.68−70 This results in the
increase of localized temperature of the substrate surface due to
electron and ion collisions, which reduces the amount of external
energy that needs to be provided compared to that in the conventional
CVD process. However, precautions must be taken due to the etching
effect of plasma. It has been observed, when using methane as a carbon
source, that longer exposure times can create higher defects and in
some cases, convert the graphene to single-walled nanotubes.48 In our case, at longer times (120 min), dense
deposits of carbon and “holes” on the surface were observed.
A representative scanning electron microscopy image of a sample synthesized
at 120 min is shown
in Figure S3, Supporting Information. The
phenomenon is a result of etching of C atoms from the surface. This
can be avoided by limiting the synthesis time in an optimized range.
Furthermore, if the plasma power is too high, it can lead to very
high localized temperature, which can cause plasmic damage, creating
lattice defects.43

Proposed Graphene Growth
Pathway under Plasma Environment
A few remarks first need
to be made to describe the possible growth
pathway for graphene in the presence of plasma from mango peels. First,
the substrate employed was copper, which exhibits a high lattice parameter
mismatch compared with graphene. Also, the solubility of carbon in
copper is very less as compared to that of other metals employed for
this purpose such as Nickel.71 Moreover,
it does not form a carbide with carbon, which makes it different from
other metal catalysts, like nickel,51 cobalt,45 and platinum.36 Because
of these features, copper follows a different mechanism than that
of its fellow transition metals.46 These
properties of copper can also be attributed to its place in the periodic
table (electronic configuration), which is just before that of the
semimetals. As a result, it shares major chemical and physical properties
with not only transition metals but also with semimetals. The proposed
steps involved in the plasma synthesis of graphene on copper from
mango peels can be described as follows (Figure 5):(a) As the temperature increases to 750
°C in the absence of plasma, the biomass is undergoing pyrolysis,
breaking of the C–O, C=O, and C–H bonds, due
to thermal energy. During this pyrolysis step also occurs intra and
intermolecular rearrangement reactions that could lead to the formation
of fairly big molecules72 that could not
favor the growth of graphene (for this reason, several reports have
proposed the use of a second pyrolysis for the synthesis of graphene
oxides).73

(b) Once plasma is on, it serves two functions:
The substrate is cleaned by hydrogen radicals etching (removal of
native oxides) for better exposure of metal sites and yields to the
formation of the carbon ions/radicals.

(c) The carbon atoms/ions/radicals get
deposited in the voids of the face-centered cubic structure of copper
surface unit cells (it does not penetrate inside the structure due
to the low solubility).

(d) The deposited carbon then forms bonds
with nearby carbon atoms, forming nucleation islands that then get
connected as the synthesis progresses with time. This represents the
nucleation and growth steps (here, the growth of several graphene
layers occurs).

(e) At
longer times, the top layers in
the structure start getting etched by the hydrogen radicals in plasma.

To observe the nucleation islands
formation, we performed TEM analysis
on the sample exposed to plasma for 15 min. Figure 6 shows the TEM images for this particular
sample. The darker zones in these images are the nucleation islands
with high density of carbon atoms which distribute themselves to form
a film (lighter zones). This supports our proposed growth mechanism
for graphene from solid source (mango peels). The dense black regions
are a result of agglomerated reduced carbon from biomass reduction.

of a sample exposed to 15 min of plasma treatment. The
growth of films (lighter zones) from islands (darker zones) is evident.

Conclusions
Herein,
we demonstrate the synthesis of graphene from mango peels
using plasma on Cu substrates. This process represents a very promising
alternative for the use of excessive mango peels produced by the food
industry. The synthesis of multiple- and single-layer graphene is
demonstrated by changing synthesis conditions. It can be concluded
that the presence of plasma is essential for the growth of graphene
from mango peels. At short plasma exposure times, i.e., ≤30
min, we observed the presence of multilayered graphene; at longer
plasma exposure time, i.e., 60 min, we observed the formation of monolayer
graphene. This was attributed to the etching of multiple layers formed
at short times due to long plasma exposure time. When employing the
proposed plasma approach, precautions must be taken due to the etching
effect of plasma, such as reducing either the plasma exposure or the
plasma power. Finally, we present a possible graphene growth pathway
under plasma environment on the basis of our experimental observations.

Experimental
Section
The mango peels (M. indica, L.),
type Kent, were supplied by the frozen food producer Frexport, S.A.
de C.V., Altex group, located at Zamora, Michoacan, Mexico. The biomass
was dried at 60 °C for 72 h, ground up, and sieved using a mesh
no. 18, which leads to a particle size of ≈1 mm. This is to
obtain homogeneous powder samples. The synthesis of graphene was performed
as follows: 10 mg of mango biomass was distributed homogeneously on
a Cu substrate previously rinsed with ethanol and wiped. The substrate
then was placed inside the reactor chamber, which was then pumped
to vacuum. The samples were heated to 750 °C at a ramp of 25
°C min–1. A flow of 50 sccm of a mixture of
10% H2/Ar was employed. The samples were kept at 750 °C
for 15 min, followed by a plasma exposure for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min,
respectively, at 300 W plasma power. The samples were then cooled
to room temperature at a natural cooling rate. The experiments were
performed in an inhouse-built plasma reactor (Figure 7). The typical reaction pressure was 0.2
torr.
