This work for the first time unfurls the fundamental
mechanisms
and sets the stage for an approach to derive electrocatalytic activity,
which is otherwise not possible, in a traditionally known wide band-gap
oxide material. Specifically, we report on the tunable optical properties,
in terms of wide spectral selectivity and red-shifted band gap, and
electrocatalytic behavior of iron (Fe)-doped gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3) model system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies
of sintered Ga2–xFexO3 (GFO) (0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) compounds provide evidence for the Fe3+ substitution at Ga3+ site without any secondary phase
formation. Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns reveals that the GFO
compounds crystallize in monoclinic crystal symmetry with a C2/m space group. The electronic structure
of the GFO compounds probed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
data reveals that at lower concentrations, Fe exhibits mixed chemical
valence states (Fe3+, Fe2+), whereas single
chemical valence state (Fe3+) is evident for higher Fe
content (x = 0.20–0.30). The optical absorption
spectra reveal a significant red shift in the optical band gap with
Fe doping. The origin of the significant red shift even at low concentrations
of Fe (x = 0.05) is attributed to the strong sp–d
exchange interaction originated from the 3d5 electrons
of Fe3+. The optical absorption edge observed at ≈450
nm with lower intensity is the characteristic of Fe-doped compounds
associated with Fe3+–Fe3+ double-excitation
process. Coupled with an optical band-gap red shift, electrocatalytic
studies of GFO compounds reveal that, interestingly, Fe-doped Ga2O3 compound exhibits electrocatalytic activity
in contrast to intrinsic Ga2O3. Fe-doped samples
(GFO) demonstrated appreciable electrocatalytic activity toward the
generation of H2 through electrocatalytic water splitting.
An onset potential and Tafel slope of GFO compounds include ∼900
mV, ∼210 mV dec–1 (x = 0.15)
and ∼1036 mV, ∼290 mV dec–1 (x = 0.30), respectively. The electrocatalytic activity of
Fe-doped Ga-oxide compounds is attributed to the cumulative effect
of different mechanisms such as doping resulting in new catalytic
centers, enhanced conductivity, and electron mobility. Hence, in this
report, for the first time, we explored a new pathway; the electrocatalytic
behavior of Fe-doped Ga2O3 resulted due to Fe
chemical states and red shift in the optical band gap. The implications
derived from this work may be applicable to a large class of compounds,
and further options may be available to design functional materials
for electrocatalytic energy production.

Introduction
Gallium oxide (β-Ga2O3) has been extensively
explored in recent years due to its viable applications in modern
optical, electronic, and optoelectronic devices such as solar-blind
UV photodetectors, power electronics, solar cells, phosphors, transparent
conducting electrode coatings, and optoelectronic devices.1−5 Ga2O3 exhibits deep optical transparency in
the ultraviolet (UV) region; hence, it is considered as a promising
candidate for next-generation deep UV photodetectors.6,7 Moreover, compared to conventional semiconductors such as SiC and
GaN, β-Ga2O3 exhibits high break downfield
(8 MV/cm) and higher Baliga’s figures of merit (≈3000),
which makes it suitable for power electronic device applications.8 β-Ga2O3 is also known
for excellent chemical sensing, where the functionality is reported
toward a variety of gases such as O2, H2, CH4, and CO.9−13 Due to the presence of oxygen vacancies, its electrical conductivity
changes upon the adsorption of these gas molecules. Ga2O3 is a promising oxygen sensing material at high temperatures;
the oxygen sensing ability is attributed to its n-type semiconducting
nature and excellent chemical and thermal stabilities at high temperatures.14−16 In addition, Ga2O3 shows the magnetic memory
effect even above room temperature due to the presence of conduction
electron spins.17,18 In view of these properties and
phenomena, Ga2O3 grabs the recent attention
of researchers, while the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms
and functional properties so as to fully utilize the potential of
the Ga2O3-based materials in emerging technological
applications is the primary driving factor.

Ga2O3 exhibits five different types of polymorphs:
corundum (α), monoclinic (β), defective spinel (γ),
orthorhombic (ε), and δ phase (also stabilizes orthorhombic
phase). Among these, monoclinic β-Ga2O3 was thermodynamically more stable than other phases.19,20 While β-Ga2O3 can be fabricated in thin
film and single crystal forms, doping of various elements in thin
film and bulk β-Ga2O3 has been attempted
to tailor the functional properties.21 To
alter the electronic structure and to derive new and unexpected optical,
magnetic, electrical, catalytic, and optoelectronic properties, doping
and alloying with selectively chosen elements is an efficient and
proven method. For instance, it has been reported that the Sn- and
Cr-doped β-Ga2O3 nanowires exhibit excellent
luminescence properties suitable for display device applications.22 Metal-doped Ga2O3 has
been found to be attractive and exhibits superior photocatalytic activity
for application in energy-harvesting devices. Enhanced photocatalytic
activity has been observed in Ga2O3 by the approach
of metal-ion dopants such as Ni, Zn, and Pb.23−25 Recently, Zadeh
et al. reported efficient photocatalytic activity in hexagonal α-Ga2O3 nanoflakes due to band narrowing.26 The changes induced in optical absorption spectra
and its consequent effect on band gap have been studied by doping
different ions, namely, Cu, W, Ti, and Mo into Ga2O3.27−30

Tuning the optical and optoelectronic properties of Ga2O3 has gained great attention due to their potential
integration
into several technological applications, which include solar-blind
photodetectors, photocatalysis, luminescent phosphors, and photovoltaics.
Ga2O3 valance band edge is found to be located
at −7.75 eV vs vacuum; hence, it can provide photogenerated
charges with high oxidizing potentials, which makes it useful for
photocatalytic applications.24 In fact,
Ga2O3 has been reported to be an excellent water-splitting
photocatalyst for the generation of hydrogen. However, the main drawback
associated with photocatalytic applications of Ga2O3 is its wide band gap (∼5 eV), which limits their functionality
due to UV-only absorption. Thus, despite its greatest potential, in
a broader context, the photocatalytic applications of this material
are considerably limited because it fails to generate sufficient electron–hole
pairs upon solar light illumination. Different approaches have been
adopted to enhance the photocatalytic activity of Ga2O3-based materials. Doping with suitable ions is one of the
most popular methods, where the photocatalytic properties of β-Ga2O3 were significantly altered by dopants. However,
during the last few years, hydrogen (H2) has been advocated
as a clean and sustainable source of energy and is considered as an
ideal candidate to meet the future energy requirements. Among different
techniques available, electrocatalytic water splitting is considered
the most economical and viable process. Electrocatalysts minimize
the energy requirement for water splitting and, in this regard, platinum
(Pt) shows the best result. However, the high price and low abundance
of Pt limit its extensive use. As an alternative, sulfide-, phosphide-,
and oxide-based materials have already been explored as an electrocatalyst.
In the present work, for the first time, we report on the iron (Fe)-doping-facilitated
selectivity across a wide spectral range and, specifically, the red-shifted
optical band gap and electrocatalytic behavior of Ga2O3 ceramics.

Experimental Details
Synthesis
Ga2–xFexO3 (GFO, 0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) compounds were synthesized from procured highly pure
(99.99%) precursor materials, Ga2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich)
and Fe2O3 (Noah Technologies Corporation), through
solid-state reaction route. To synthesize GFO compounds, initially,
the precursor materials Ga2O3 and Fe2O3 were weighed in a stoichiometric ratio in accordance
with the desired compound. Precursor materials weighed in a stoichiometric
ratio were collected in an agate mortar and homogeneously ground in
the presence of an alcohol-wetting media. To obtain single-phase GFO
compounds, calcination of homogeneously mixed powders was done in
a muffle furnace at 1100 °C for 6 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min.
After calcination and confirmation phase purity, calcined powders
were reground to obtain ultrafine particles with narrow particle size
distribution to improve the sintered density of samples. Uniaxial
hydraulic press was used to prepare circular green pellets of 8 mm
diameter and 1 mm thickness [load ≈ 5 ton]. Green pellets were
sintered at 1200 °C for 6 h, and sintered high-dense pellets
were used for further analysis.

Characterization
X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Rigaku Benchtop powder X-ray
diffractometer (Mini Flex II) was used to confirm the phase purity
and to determine the crystal structure of synthesized GFO compounds.
Scanning parameters were 10–80° (2θ range), a step
size of 0.02°, and a scan rate of 0.6° min–1. Structural refinement of selected compositions was carried out
using full prof software package.31

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
The XPS spectra
of GFO compounds were collected employing a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD
spectrometer using a high-performance Al Kα monochromatic X-ray
source (1486.6 eV) and a high-resolution hemispherical analyzer. The
X-ray source was set at 150 W. Emitted photoelectrons were collected
using a detector, which is aligned normally to the sample surface.
Data were collected in a 700 × 300 μm2 area
with a pass energy of 20 eV, which produced a full width at half-maximum
of 0.59 eV for the Ag 3d5/2 core level of a reference Ag
surface. Charge neutralization was obtained with low-energy electrons
(<2 eV). Data were analyzed by employing Casa XPS software using
Gaussian/Lorentzian (GL(30)) line shape and Shirley background correction.32,33 Before collecting XPS spectra, sample surfaces were cleaned using
an ultraviolet ozone cleaner for a duration of 5 min, and then the
samples were loaded into an XPS chamber to make sure that the contaminated
carbon has been removed. The binding energy (BE) of carbon (C 1s)
at 284.8 eV was used as the charge reference. Survey scans were performed
at pass energies of 160 eV, while high-resolution scans were carried
out at a pass energy of 20 eV. Survey scans were taken over the binding
energy (BE) range of 0–1200 eV. Ga 2p spectra were collected
to avoid the interference of Ga 3d peaks with the O 2s peak. Estimation
error was taken ±0.01 atom % for the concentration of various
elements present, i.e., Ga, Fe, and O.

Spectral Selectivity-Optical Absorption
Optical absorption
edge is associated with charge transfer from the valance band to conduction
band, which originally depends on the overall electronic band structure
of a compound. Though the X-ray diffraction analysis shows the evidence
for elemental substitution in the parent phase, however, optical absorption
spectra can provide deeper insights into elemental substitution in
the parent phase. Hence, we have collected the absorption spectra
of GFO compounds using UV–vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer,
Model: Lambda 1050). Sintered GFO pellets were employed for the measurements.

Electrocatalytic Activity Studies
To evaluate the effect
of doping on the electrocatalytic activity of the doped and undoped
samples, their activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
was analyzed. For this three-electrode
system, where the sample is the working electrode, Ag/AgCl is the
reference electrode, and platinum is the counter electrode, it was
formulated in the presence of a 0.5 M H2SO4 aq
electrolyte. The preparation of the working electrode was done by
mixing the powdered bulk samples with 80 μL of a 5 wt % Nafion
117 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and drop-casting 20 μL of the completely
mixed solution onto a freshly polished glassy carbon working electrode.
Subsequently, the redox properties were studied using linear sweep
voltammetry (CHI 6273E potentiostat) with a scan rate of 20 mV s –1 over a voltage range of 0 to −1.3 V.

Results and Discussion
Structure Refinement
Phase purity of all of the synthesized
GFO compounds was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. Some
insightful information on the crystal structure of GFO compounds obtained
from XRD experimental results has been reported elsewhere.34 However, the purpose of the detailed XRD high-resolution
scans, as well as refinement procedures, is made in this work, to
better understand the Fe site occupancy and structural distortions
(if any) in the parent lattice of β-Ga2O3. X-ray diffraction data reveal that all of the compounds were phase-pure
without any secondary phases. Figure 1 represents the refined X-ray diffraction patterns
of selected GFO compounds. Rietveld refinement of diffraction patterns
was carried out by considering the monoclinic crystal symmetry with
a C2/m space group. Pseudo Voigt
peak shape function has been used to refine experimental diffraction
patterns. In all of the refined patterns, simulated and experimental
pattern intensities were fitted with a minimal differential curve.
The obtained goodness of fit (χ2) for three selected
compounds is 1.61 (x = 0), 1.49 (x = 0.20), and 1.12 (x = 0.30). Hence, the structural
refinement data reveals that, even at a higher concentration of Fe
(x = 0.30), GFO compounds stabilize in monoclinic
crystal symmetry, which is similar to the intrinsic Ga2O3. The refined unit cell parameters are provided in Table 1. Refined cell parameters
indicate a small increment in unit cell volume associated with small
ionic radii difference between Fe3+ and Ga3+. The atomic coordinates obtained from the refinement procedure are
listed in Table 2.

XRD patterns is also presented. The experimental and calculated XRD
patterns after the refinement are shown. Good agreement between the
experimental and calculated XRD patterns can be noted.

Electronic Structure
The XPS survey scans of GFO compounds
are represented in Figure 2. The survey scans indicate core-level peaks of constituent
elements such as Ga, Fe, O, Ga LMM Auger peak, O KLL, and C 1s. The
C 1s peak corresponds to hydrocarbons on the surface of the samples;
these hydrocarbons will form on the surface of the sample due to exposure
to air before transferring the sample to an XPS chamber. However,
in survey scans, we are able to observe Fe 3p peaks in compounds with
higher Fe concentration (in Figure 2, it is indicated as a red dotted oval).

Figure 2 XPS survey
scans of GFO compounds. The peaks identified are as
marked.

High-resolution XPS spectra of Ga 2p and O 1s peaks
are shown in Figure 3. The peak assignments
and binding energy (BE) comparison are made following the NIST database.
The Ga 2p region (Figure 3a) shows the high-resolution spectra of both Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 located at ≈1117.6 and 1144.6 eV,
respectively. The Ga 2p3/2 peak is located at a higher
BE (1117.6 eV) in all of the GFO samples compared to pure Ga metal,
which is located at 1117.0 eV.35,36 Compared to the Ga
metallic state, the observed Ga 2p core-level peaks exhibit a positive
shift of 0.6 eV, indicating that all of the Ga exists in its fully
oxidized state (Ga3+). It has been widely reported that
the Ga 2p core-level peaks exhibit a positive shift of 0.6 eV due
to the redistribution of electronic charge leading to the formation
of the fully oxidized state (i.e., Ga3+).37 Thus, the Ga XPS data, which are consistent with the values
reported for Ga2O3 standard in the literature,
confirms the existence of Ga ions in the highest chemical valence
(Ga3+). The slight change in BE and peak intensity of Ga
peak with Fe doping may be due to the weakening of Ga–O bonds
in Ga2O3. This weakening causes a decrease in
the electron density around the Ga ions.38

Figure 3 High-resolution
XPS spectra of GFO compounds (a) Ga 2p and (b)
O 1s.

The O 1s peak (Figure 3b) appears at a BE of 530 eV, which is a
characteristic of
Ga–O bond. This peak is very sensitive to the variation in
chemical bonding.39 It can be noted that
this O 1s peak is not symmetric for all of the GFO samples. The peak
fitting of the O 1s core-level peak results in at least two components
representing the different chemical states or differently bonded oxygen.
The most intense and main component, which is centered at a BE of
530.4 eV, is the characteristic of oxygen bonded to Ga within the
GFO compound. The O 1s peak for Fe2O3 and/or
FeO becomes merged with the O 1s peak for Ga2O3 as most metal-oxide peaks can be obtained in a BE range of 530–531
eV. This has caused the O 1s peaks to become slightly broader in the
Fe-containing compounds. A second component, which appears as a shoulder
contribution with minor intensity, is located at a higher BE of 532
eV. This component with minor intensity can be attributed to either
carbonyl (oxygen bonded to carbon) or hydroxyl (oxygen bonded to hydrogen)
groups, which were adsorbed onto the surface during sample handling.36

Figure 4 represents
the high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2p. The deconvoluted spectra
of Fe 2p3/2 peak clearly reveal that Fe exhibits mixed
valance state (Fe3+ and Fe2+) in GFO samples
with lower Fe content, whereas Fe exhibits single valance state (Fe3+) in compounds with higher Fe content. It is mainly because
of three reasons, namely, considerable iron content, to maintain the
stoichiometry, and charge neutrality. With an increasing iron concentration
in the GFO compounds, the intensity of Fe peak increases, whereas
the intensity of the Ga peak decreases gradually. In addition, the
shake-up satellite peak around 720 eV was observed in accordance with
the literature, which is the characteristic feature of Fe3+ in α-Fe2O3.40,41 However, the satellite peak is less pronounced in compounds with
mixed valency state.

compounds.

Optical Properties
The optical absorption spectra and
associated data analyses of GFO compounds are presented in Figure 5. It is evident from
the optical absorption spectra (Figure 5a) that the Fe doping induces a change in the absorption
edge. From the cutoff wavelengths of all of the compounds, it is evident
that the GFO compounds with Fe concertation x ≤
0.10 exhibit the absorption edge in the UV regions (≤400 nm),
whereas compounds with Fe concentration x ≥
0.15 exhibit the absorption edge in the visible region (≥400
nm). As the concentration of Fe increases, the absorption edge shifts
from the UV to visible region, which is referred to as “red
shift”. In all of the GFO compounds, the progressive shift
in the absorption edge is clearly noted. Moreover, a small absorption
edge at ≈450 nm was found in Fe-substituted compounds (indicated
with a red oval in Figure 5a). Such small absorption band is associated with a double-excitation
process of Fe3+–Fe3+ and is due to transitions
from 6A1(S) + 6A2(S) to 4T1(G) + 4T2(G).42−44Figure 5b represents
the enlarged profile of Fe-induced double-excitation process. The
inset in Figure 5b
represents the relative intensity of Fe-induced absorption edge associated
with a double-excitation process with Fe concentration. From the inset
figure, it is evident that the relative intensity of Fe peak increases
with increasing Fe content, as expected.

Figure 5 (a) Optical absorption
spectra of GFO. (b) Enlarged profile representing
the intensity variation of peak associated with Fe3+–Fe3+ double-excitation process (inset: relative intensity of
Fe-induced double-excitation edge vs Fe content).

Figure 6 shows the
variation in the band gap of GFO compounds with Fe concentration.
The determination of the cutoff wavelength to calculate the band gap
is presented in the inset of Figure 4b. The band gap of intrinsic Ga2O3 is 4.56 (±0.01) eV, which is in good agreement with that reported
in the literature.45 However, Fe incorporation
into Ga2O3 considerably decreases the band gap
even at a very initial concentration. At the very first step of Fe,
i.e., x = 0.05, the GFO compounds experience a significant
reduction in band gap from 4.56 to 3.34 eV (Figure 4b). However, further doping of Fe still induces
the band-gap narrowing but at a much lower rate. Overall, the band
gap finally reduces to 2.95 (±0.01) eV when Fe content is increased
to x = 0.30. While such a reduction in band gap is
also noted in Cu-, W-, Mo-, and Ti-doped Ga2O3, the red shift observed in these GFO compounds even for a lower
content of Fe is very significant.

Figure 6 Band-gap variation with Fe content. Significant
reduction in band
gap in GFO compounds is evident.

The chemistry behind the observed wide-range spectral
selectivity
and red-shift band gap in GFO compounds can be explained as follows.
Based on the XRD data and refinement procedure, the substitutional
nature of Fe in Ga2O3 is evident for the entire
range of dopant composition. This can be easily understood from the
considerations of the Shannon ionic radii of Ga and Fe. The ionic
radii of Ga and Fe are in excellent close match with each other: Ga3+, 0.62 Å (octahedral coordination) and 0.47 Å (tetrahedral
coordination); and Fe3+, 0.64 Å (octahedral coordination)
and 0.49 Å (tetrahedral coordination).46 Therefore, Fe3+can be substituted in the Ga site, which
can replace Ga3+ from both octahedral and tetrahedral positions
in stoichiometric proportion. Thus, no perturbation to the parent
crystal structure, i.e., monoclinic structure of β-Ga2O3, is seen even at the highest concentration (x = 0.30) of Fe doping into Ga2O3.
Under such isostructural configuration, electronic structural changes
occur due to the Fe substituting for Ga. Thus, the substantial red
shift observed in band gap can be explained based on the sp–d
exchange interaction between valance band electrons and localized
d electrons of Fe in Ga2O3. The sp–d
exchange interactions led to positive and negative corrections to
valance and conduction bands; as a consequence, band-gap narrowing
occurs in the systems with sp–d exchange interactions.47−49 In the present case, the outer-most electron configurations of Ga3+ and Fe3+ are 3d10 and 3d5, respectively. Therefore, in intrinsic Ga2O3, 3d electrons do not involve in hybridization, whereas in the case
of Fe-doped Ga2O3 compounds, 3d5 electrons
involve in hybridization with O p-orbitals. Owing to this, there is
a strong s–d and p–d exchange interactions present in GFO compounds, which leads to abrupt
band-gap narrowing. These interactions and, hence, the spectral selectivity
and band gap can be tuned by carefully controlling the Fe content
and, hence, the dopant chemistry in GFO compounds.

Figure 7 represents
the schematic energy diagram of intrinsic β-Ga2O3- and Fe3+-doped Ga2O3. The
figure clearly shows positive and negative corrections to the valance
band and conduction band due to sp–d exchange interaction in
Fe3+-doped Ga2O3, associated band-gap
narrowing. As explained, in the case of intrinsic β-Ga2O3, valance band edge is dominated by O 2p orbitals and
conduction band is dominated by Ga 4s orbitals, whereas in the case
of Fe3+-doped compounds, valance band edge is dominated
by O 2p orbitals and conduction band edge is dominated by Ga 4s and
Fe 3d in contrast to intrinsic β-Ga2O3. The sp–d exchange originates in Fe-doped compounds due to
the contribution of Fe 3d electrons to conduction band.

Electrocatalytic Activity
After confirming that Fe
doping in GFO can intimately modulate its optical properties and band
gap, we explored its potential to elicit unconventional properties
in Ga2O3. While the use of Ga2O3 for lasers,50 phosphors,51 etc. is being explored in detail, its potential
as a catalyst is comparatively less explored. Recent studies indicate
that Ga2O3 has considerable utility as photocatalysts
for the creation of H2 fuel, especially through water splitting.52 However, owing to the large band gap of Ga2O3 that makes electrocatalytic reactions tedious,
the applicability of Ga2O3-based materials toward
electrocatalytic processes remained unexplored. Optical band-gap analysis
of GFO compounds reveals that there is significant reduction in optical
band gap, which could also impact its electrocatalytic characteristics. Figure 8a,b illustrates the
electrocatalytic analysis of intrinsic Ga2O3 and two doped samples with Fe contents 0.15 and 0.30, employing
HER as the model reaction. To the best of our knowledge, Ga2O3-based samples (individually) as an electrocatalyst
for HER are still not reported in the literature. As expected, the
parent Ga2O3 sample did not exhibit any electrocatalytic
activity under aerobic conditions within the potential range explored
in the study. However, both the doped samples (GFO) demonstrated appreciable
electrocatalytic activity toward the generation of H2 through
electrocatalytic water splitting (Figure 8a). Moreover, the doping percentages demonstrated
an intricate relationship to the observed catalytic activity (Figure 8a,b). The GFO sample
with lower doping concentration (0.15) demonstrated superior catalytic
activity compared to GFO with 0.30 Fe doping (Figure 8a). GFO sample with x =
0.15 has an onset potential of ∼900 mV and a Tafel slope of
210 mV dec–1, whereas the GFO with x = 0.3 showed an onset of 1036 mV and a Tafel slope of 290 mV dec–1 (Figure 8a,b). Three principal steps involved in the conversion of
H+ to H2 are commonly expressed as the Volmer
(eq 1), Heyrovsky (eq 2), and Tafel (eq 3) equations Volmer:
1   Heyrovsky:
2   Tafel:
3  The high value of the Tafel slope for GFO
samples reveals that the process is mostly governed through the Volmer–Heyrovsky
mechanism. The inset of Figure 8a demonstrates the enlarged view of selected potential range
showing the onset potential for each sample. The lower-onset potential
and Tafel slope, in combination with a higher current density, revealed
the superiority of 0.15 GFO sample and also emphasize the importance
of ideal doping content to get enhanced catalytic activity. The electrocatalytic
generation of H2 demonstrated here proves for the first
time that simple doping can evoke novel electrocatalytic performances
in Ga2O3-based material systems.

of the doped and undoped Ga2O3. (a) Polarization
curves obtained at a 20 mV
s–1 scan rate and (b) Tafel slopes for x = 0.15- and 0.30-doped samples.

We believe that the inculcation and modulation
of electrocatalytic
activity in traditionally noncatalytic Ga2O3 samples through Fe doping are the result of three disparate mechanisms.
While it is trivial to mention that the creation of new catalytic
centers in Ga2O3 through Fe is the reason for
the electrocatalytic performance, the nonlinear and bell-shaped behavior
of catalytic activity points to a more complex enabling mechanism.
It is reported that transition-metal doping adjacent to catalytic
centers (mostly electronegative elements such as oxygen or sulfur)
in electrocatalysts can enhance its activity by lowering the hydrogen
adsorption free energy (ΔGH).53−55 Hence, the lattice inclusion of Fe while doping creates highly catalytic
centers and lowers hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH) by weakening the bonds between Ga and O atoms
in the lattice, resulting in a more favorable adsorption of proton
and its subsequent reduction to H2. However, this still
does not explain the modulation of catalytic activity with respect
to doping content, as well as the bell-shaped behavior of the activity.
The dependence of electron mobility and conductivity of the sample
on catalyst performance in HER is well demonstrated. A higher electron
mobility and conductivity will allow the generated electrons to travel
across the catalyst to reach the active centers to enable faster reduction,
which results in lower-onset potential. The presence of metals in
the sample is expected to minimally raise the conductivity values
of the doped samples. However, the enhanced conductivity does not
seem to follow a linear relationship with doping. From the XPS study
(Figure 4), it is established
that lower doping concentration of Fe has two valence states of +2
and +3, whereas the higher one has Fe only in the +3 oxidation state.
The presence of Fe in mixed valence states can impart enhanced conductivity
and electron mobility within the system via intervalence charge transfer.56 Hence, between GFO sample (0.15 and 0.3), owing
to the presence of mixed valence states of Fe, the O.15 GFO sample
has the highest conductivity and hence demonstrates better activity.
In addition to decreasing the ΔGH value and increasing the conductivity, Fe doping also decreases
the band gap of the material. Based on the observed catalytic activity,
we hypothesize that the band positions (especially the conduction
band) for doped samples are such that proton reduction is easier for
the lower doping concentrations (illustrated in Figure 9). Hence, as a cumulative effect of the above-stated
three phenomena, GFO samples with a 0.15 Fe content demonstrate the
best catalytic activity toward HER.

Figure 9 Hypothetical schematic showing the band
positions in the conduction
band for intrinsic and Fe-doped compounds.

Though we were able to inculcate appreciable electrocatalytic
activity
in Ga2O3 through simple metal doping, it is
worth noting that the obtained results are not optimal for their application
as an efficient electrocatalyst. However, the aim of the study was
to create a new avenue for Ga2O3-based material
in electrocatalysis and to prove that doping-induced band-gap tuning
can be an effective pathway to generate tunable electrocatalytic activity
in a system that had no activity in the pristine state. We postulate
that engineering the doping concentration, doping type, the size and
shape, inducing more catalytic centers, or creating high activity
hybrids, etc. can result in Ga2O3-based catalyst
with significantly embellished catalytic properties. However, such
optimizations are beyond the scope of this work, and efforts in this
direction are currently being undertaken.

Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion, Fe-doped Ga2O3 compounds (GFO)
(0.0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) were synthesized and
their structural, chemical, optical, and electrocatalytic properties
were evaluated. GFO compounds are single phase even at higher Fe concentration;
structural analyses confirm that these GFO compounds crystallize in
monoclinic crystal symmetry with a C2/m space group. Chemical analyses indicate high-quality GFO materials,
where Fe exhibits mixed chemical valence states (Fe3+,
Fe2+) for a lower concentration of Fe doping. However,
for doping with higher Fe (x = 0.20–0.30)
content, iron ions exhibit only the single chemical valence state
(Fe3+). Significant red shift of the optical band gap occurs
in GFO compounds compared to that in intrinsic Ga oxide. Iron-doping-facilitated
strong sp–d exchange interaction, which originates from the
3d5 electrons of Fe3+, is accounted for the
observed red shift in the GFO compounds. In addition, a signature
of Fe3+–Fe3+ double-excitation process
is evident as a small optical absorption edge at ≈450 nm in
GFO compounds. Moreover, GFO compounds (x = 0, 0.15,
and 0.30) exhibit electrocatalytic water splitting toward the generation
of H2 in contrast to intrinsic Ga2O3. An onset potential and Tafel slope of GFO samples include: x = 0.15 (onset potential ∼900 mV and Tafel slope
∼ 210 mV dec–1) and x =
0.30 (onset potential ∼1036 mV and a Tafel slope ∼290
mV dec–1). The electrocatalytic activity of Fe-doped
compounds was attributed to resulted new catalytic centers, enhanced
conductivity, and electron mobility. As a concluding and general remark,
for the first time, we explored a new pathway of deriving electrocatalytic
behavior in Fe-doped Ga2O3, while such activity
was totally absent in the intrinsic or undoped phase. Therefore, the
outcomes and implications derived from this work may be applicable
to a large class of compounds, and further options may be available
to design functional materials for electrocatalytic energy production.
