An
important and surprising finding that the acetalization and
ketalization of aldehydes and ketones with alcohols, respectively,
proceed smoothly in the presence of 0.1 mol % acid, without removing
water, has been presented. This process has many merits, such as commercial
available catalysts with low cost and low loadings (as low as 0.03
mol %), quite a broad substrate scope (including various aldehydes,
ketones, acid-sensitive substrates, and diols), a wide range of reaction
temperature (−60 to 50 °C), high yields, large-scale preparation,
environmental friendliness, and simple work-up procedure. This new
protocol has also been successfully applied to protect the important
organic compounds, such as 1,3-diols, 1,2-diols, acid-sensitive substrates,
glucose, and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A protective
group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification
of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in the course of
the preparation of multifunctional complex organic molecules. It plays
an important role in organic, medicinal, carbohydrate, and drug design
chemistry. As Wuts pointed out, organic synthesis has not yet matured
to the point where protective groups are not needed for the synthesis
of natural and unnatural products; thus, the development of new methods
for functional group protection and deprotection continues.1 Acetalization/ketalization is one of the most
useful methods for the protection of aldehydes/ketones, which are
extensively encountered in organic synthesis.2,3 The
acetals/ketals are traditionally generated by treating aldehydes/ketones
with alcohols in the presence of typical acid catalysts (such as dry
HCl, H2SO4, trifluoroacetic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic
acid), which are often corrosive.4−7 In addition, the acidic environment is incompatible
with the acid-sensitive groups of the substrates, such as N-Boc-protected
amines, silyl-protected alcohols, alkenes, and alkynes.8 Especially, the acetals/ketals are also highly
unstable because of the reversible reactions to the hemiacetals/hemiketals
and the starting carbonyls; as a result, to avoid shifting the equilibrium
back to the reactants, the byproduct water has to be removed by additional
physical and chemical means.8 A series
of Lewis acids,9−17 other homogeneous catalysts,18−23 different metal complexes of Pt(II), Pd(II), and Rh(II),24−28 and various heterogeneous catalysts29−36 have been reported to catalyze the acetal/ketal protection of carbonyl
compounds. Recently, a few more successful and efficient acetalization/ketalization
reactions have also been reported: (1) Connon designed a series of
aprotic salts (pyridinium salt derivatives, dialkyltriazolium salts,
and imidazolium salts) capable of behaving as Brønsted acids
for chemoselective acetalization of aldehydes;37−40 (2) Azzena developed a novel
acetalization/ketalization formation process of aliphatic and aromatic
aldehydes/ketones with diols employing ammonium salts as acidic catalysts,
using cyclopentyl methyl ether as a solvent under Dean–Stark
conditions;41 (3) Ying’s group developed
a mesoporous polymelamine–formaldehyde polymer as an efficient
catalyst for chemoselective acetalization of aldehydes;42 and (4) very recently, graphitic-C3N4 has been shown to catalyze photoacetalization of aldehydes/ketones
with alcohols to acetals/ketals in high yields using visible light
under ambient conditions.43 Although acetalization
has been widely reported and well-investigated, the recent reports
also suffered from lack of generality because of the following drawbacks:
limited substrate scope, use of toxic or expensive reagents, high
reaction temperature, stoichiometric amounts of catalysts, poor chemoselectivity
and atom-economy, the need for excess amounts of drying agents, long
reaction times, low yields, high costs, tedious workup, and so forth.
Consequently, most of the reported methods had inevitably lowered
the overall synthetic efficiency. Up to now, the application of acetalization/ketalizationin
chemical industries, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and
intermediates, has been hampered by the lack of general methods. Therefore,
the development of alternative technologies that are greener, safer,
and more environmentally friendly is highly desirable.

Can we
find a simple molecule which acts like an enzyme for the
acetalization of aldehydes/ketones? If this was possible, it would
represent a remarkable synthetic alternative to many established acetalizations.
In particular, such processes would overcome the abovementioned catalyst
limitations/problems and allow the cost-effective manufacture of acetals
or ketals in chemicals and pharmaceutical industries on an industrial
scale. As we know, to increase the electrophilicity of the carbonyl
carbon in the acetalization/ketalization process, acids are required
to promote the reactions by forming oxonium ions. However, the alcohols
would also be protonated in the presence of excess acids, dramatically
decreasing the nucleophilicity of the alcohols. In addition, the excess
acids may also cause the hydrolysis of acetals/ketals to aldehydes/ketones.
Therefore, we envisioned that the acid loadings would be crucial for
the generation of acetal/ketal products.

2 Results
and Discussion
To verify the feasibility of our proposal,
acetalization of trans-cinnamaldehyde with methanol
was chosen as the model
reaction using different loadings of concentrated hydrochloric acid
(12 mol/L) at ambient temperature. The results are summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1. Surprisingly, the formation
of dimethyl acetal proceeded quite well in 20 min even with 0.005
mol % hydrochloric acid without removing the water (Table 1, entry 1).
The conversion was significantly improved by increasing the acid loadings
(entry 2), and excellent data were observed by using a range of acid
loadings from 0.03 to 30 mol % (entries 3–14). However, the
formation of acetal decreased as the acid loadings continued to increase
(entries 15–18), and only 6% conversion was observed by using
600 mol % acid, probably because the alcohols were also protonated
resulting in decreased nucleophilicity in the presence of excess acid
(entry 19). In addition, the hydrolysis of acetals might also become
a serious problem and the acetalization conversions decreased. It
should be noted that no cis–transisomerization was observed
during our investigation.44 We further
explored the reaction with 0.1 mol % hydrochloric acid at different
temperatures. It was found that the temperature has little effect
on the reactions, and excellent conversions were also obtained ranging
from 50 to −60 °C (entries 20–24). For example,
hydrochloric acid exhibited a very high catalytic activity when the
domino reaction was carried out at 50 °C, and excellent conversion
was obtained in 3 min with 0.1 mol % hydrochloric acid (entry 20);
the reaction time should be extended at lower temperature (entry 24).
Although the reported methods pointed out that the acetalization reaction
was sensitive to water, the reaction proceeded smoothly without any
effect on the reaction rate and conversion even when the concentration
of HCl decreased from 12 to 4 mol/L (entries 25 and 26), indicating
that the loadings of the acid catalyst should be more crucial for
the formation of acetal products.

Subsequently, our attention turned
to evaluate its general utility
in the acetalization of other aldehydes. A wide range of aldehydes 1 were treated with methanol at an ambient temperature, catalyzed
by 0.1 mol % hydrochloric acid. As shown in Table 2, several points are noteworthy: (1) All
acetalization reactions proceeded smoothly with excellent conversions
and yields (entries 1–18). (2) The scope of the acetalization
reactions was proven to be quite broad. Various aldehydes, such as substituted cinnamaldehydes (entries 1–5), aliphatic α β-unsaturated aldehydes (entry 6), aryl aldehydes (entries 7–12), and aliphatic aldehydes (entries 15 and 16), could be transformed
into the corresponding acetals with excellent conversions and isolated
yields. In addition, the heteroaromatic aldehydes, such as 2-furaldehyde
and 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (entries 13 and 14) as well as the cyclic
aldehyde (entry 17), could be successfully employed to afford excellent
yields. Especially, bisaldehyde 1r also furnished bisacetal 2r in an excellent yield. (3) In general, the substituents
on the aryl ring of aromatic aldehydes had little effect on the efficiency
of the acetalization reaction. However, cinnamaldehydes with electron-donating
groups showed a relatively low activity, and trimethylorthoformate
(TMOF) had to be added to improve the conversion (entry 3). (4) Most
of the aldehydes underwent nearly quantitative acetalization at 0.1
mol % catalyst loading in a short reaction time, and the products
could be purified by a simple extraction. (5) The reaction is not
confined to methanolysis. The protection of benzaldehyde as a stable
five-membered cyclic 1,3-dioxolane also proceeded smoothly under identical
reaction conditions to afford products with excellent conversions
(entries 19 and 20). (6) Other alcohols, such as ethanol, n-propanol, and 1,3-diols, were also effective for the acetalization
(entries 21–23). (7) To investigate the scalability of this
protocol, the acetalization reaction of cinnamaldehyde with methanol
was scaled up by 200 times in comparison with the reaction shown in Table 2, entry 1. The reaction
was also effective and could conveniently prepare the acetal on a
gram scale (>5 g) with slightly inferior conversion.

Ketalization usually
requires an elevated temperature or water
needs to be removed under Dean–Stark conditions to avoid shifting
the equilibrium back to the reactants. Therefore, the development
of a greener, safer, and environmentally friendly method for ketalization
still represents a major challenge in organic synthesis. Encouraged
by the successful results described above, we turned our attention
to the possible ketalization reactions of ketones, taking acetophenone 3a and methanol as the model compounds under the optimized
conditions; a low conversion (7%) was observed after 30 min, even
when the reaction time was extended to 24 h. Fortunately, a quantitative
conversion of the ketone was achieved when 1.2 equiv of TMOF was added
in 12 h (Table 3, entry
1). Subsequently, a series of ketones were applied to establish the
scope and generality of the protocol, and the corresponding ketals 4 were produced in high conversions/yields (entries 1–15).
The aromatic ketones 3 with electron-donating groups
such as a methyl group showed a relatively low activity, and the reaction
time was extended to 24 h (entries 5 and 7). On the other hand, the
aromatic ketones 3 with electron-withdrawing groups such
as F, Cl, and Br ones showed a higher activity, giving almost quantitative
ketal products (entries 2–4 and 8). The cyclic and acyclic
aliphatic ketones also exhibited a high reactivity (entries 9–13).
Interestingly, when methanol was replaced with ethylene glycol, 1,3-dioxolanes 4j′, 4k′ were also obtained with
excellent conversions/yields (entries 11 and 13). We also investigated
the reactions of conjugated enone systems, and excellent conversions/yields
were obtained without forming oxy-Michael/ketal derivatives (entries
14 and 15).45−49

The diols or
polyols are widely encountered in carbohydrates, macrolides,
pharmaceutical agents, and nucleosides, leading to the development
of a number of new methods for these functional groups protection.
Dioxolanes and dioxanes are the most common protective groups for
diols. Gratifyingly, 0.1 mol % hydrochloric acid readily promoted
the ketalization of a range of diols with acetone (Scheme 1). 1,3-Diols, such as glycol 5a, was transformed to the dioxanes in a high yield, as well
as the 1,2-diols (e.g. 1,2-octanediol 5b) and R-(−)-3-chloro-1,2-propanediol 5c were
transformed to the dioxolanes in high yields, usually without further
purification. These studies demonstrate the high efficiency and the
wide synthetic utility of the current catalytic protocol.

Scheme 1 Ketalization
of Acetone with 1,3-Diols and 1,2-Diols
The compatibility of this method with other acid-sensitive
substrates,
such as N-Boc-protected amines 7a, silyl-protected alcohols 7c, and tetrahydropyranyl-protected alcohols 7b, was also established. As exemplified in Scheme 2, the acetalization/ketalization of aldehydes/ketones
with methanol to form dimethyl acetals/ketals proceeded well with
0.1 mol % hydrochloric acid, also without affecting the abovementioned
groups.

Scheme 2 Acetalization/Ketalization of Acid-Sensitive Substrates with
Methanol
To further demonstrate
its potential applications, this method
was applied for the protection of other important carbonyl compounds
(Scheme 3). Ethyl acetoacetate 7d, which is used as one of the most important chemical intermediates
in the production of a wide variety of compounds, was transformed
to dimethyl ketal 8d in a good yield under mild conditions,
while TMOF should be added (eq 1). 5-norbornene-2-carboxaldehyde 7e, which contained a double bond, could be successfully employed
to afford the corresponding acetal 8e in an excellent
yield, while the double bond remained intact (eq 2). The acetalization/ketalization
of glucose is very important in carbohydrate chemistry. However, the
methylation of d-glucose was usually treated with SOCl2,50 AcCl,51 Ac2O/BF3,52 and
Amberlyst-15.53 To our delight, direct
treatment of d-glucose 7f with 0.5 mol % hydrochloric
acid in methanol at 60 °C for 72 h gave methyl d-glucopyranoside 8f in 91% yield (eq 3).

Scheme 3 Acetalization/Ketalization of Other
Important Carbonyl Compounds
with Alcohol
To further assess
the usefulness of our protocol, the applications
of this acetalization protocol in heterocyclic compounds synthesis
were also investigated. As described in Scheme 4, two possible structural isomers (10 and 10′) would be obtained by treatment
of o-isothiocyanato-(E)-cinnamaldehydes 9 with primary amines. Interestingly, only 3,4-dihydroquinazolines 10 were exclusively obtained when the reaction was performed
in methanol under an ambient temperature. However, when the o-isothiocyanato-(E)-cinnamaldehydes were
treated with hydrochloric acid (0.1 mol %) in methanol, they could
be transformed into their corresponding acetals 11 in
excellent isolated yields. Subsequently, the S-terminus of thiourea,
not the N-terminus of thiourea, served as a nucleophilic site to react
with the γ-position of β,γ-unsaturated dimethylacetal,
following elimination a methoxyl group to afford the cyclizing product
4H-3,1-benzothiazine derivative 12 with
excellent selectivity in refluxing toluene.

Scheme 4 Applications of This
Acetalization Protocol in Heterocyclic Compound
Synthesis
In addition, other
strong inorganic acids (e.g., H2SO4 and HNO3) as well as the strong organic acids
(e.g., CF3COOH and CF3SO3H) also
exhibited a high catalytic activity for the acetalization of cinnamaldehyde
with methanol at a low acid loading under an ambient temperature,
and excellent conversions were obtained in 20 min (Table 4, entries 1–4). As expected,
the weak acids, such as acetic acid and p-nitrobenzoic
acid (PNBA), showed poor catalytic activity (entries 5 and 6).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have presented a greener,
safer, more efficient
and environmentally friendly procedure for the acetalization/ketalization
of aldehydes and ketones. Most of the catalyst problems for acetalization/ketalization
have been overcome, and these are the important points: (1) The main
advantage of this process is the use of very low catalyst loadings
(0.1 mol %), and the acid loadings varying from 0.03 to 30 mol % have
marginal effect on the catalytic activity and conversion; (2) The
acetalization/ketalization protocol is insensitive to water, and there
is no need to remove water by additional physical and chemical means;
(3) The acetalization/ketalization process is relatively insensitive
to temperature. (4) The reaction scope is much broader than previous
reports. Whether aldehydes (such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes,
aryl aldehydes, and aliphatic aldehydes) or ketones (such as aromatic
ketones, cyclic ketones, conjugated enones, and aliphatic ketones)
or even the diols (such as 1,2-diols and 1,3-diols), excellent results
were generally obtained. (5) The acetalization/ketalization protocol
is compatible with acid-sensitive substrates, such as N-Boc-protected
amines, silyl-protected alcohols, and alkenes; (6) The reaction was
proven effectively and conveniently to prepare the acetals on a gram
scale (>5 g) with slightly inferior conversion; (7) The work-up
procedure
is remarkably simple, and the products do not require further purification
in most cases; (8) The strong inorganic acids, as well as the strong
organic acids, also exhibited high catalytic activity for the acetalization;
(9) The acetalization/ketalization protocol has been successfully
applied to construct heterocyclic compounds and protect the complex
organic molecules. The broad reaction scope and remarkable versatility
will enable us to tackle a broad spectrum of aldehydes/ketones/diols
for the production of acetals/ketals with satisfied results. These
new and important findings will have a promising prospective in industrial
applications because of its considerably low catalyst loading, cost
effectiveness, ease of handling, environmental friendliness, high
conversions, and compatibility with acid-sensitive substrates. We
anticipate that this protocol would arouse more interest in the chemistry
of acetalization/ketalization and their further applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Methods
Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded with tetramethylsilane as the
internal standard. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass-backed
silica plates. Column chromatography was performed using silica gel
(150–200 mesh) eluting with ethyl acetate and petroleum ether. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz, and 13C
NMR spectra were recorded at 150 MHz. Chemical shifts (δ) are
reported in ppm downfield from CDCl3 (δ = 7.26 ppm)
or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (δ = 2.50 ppm) for 1H NMR and relative to the central CDCl3 resonance (δ
= 77.0 ppm) or DMSO resonance (δ = 39.5 ppm) for 13C NMR spectroscopy. Coupling constants (J) are given
