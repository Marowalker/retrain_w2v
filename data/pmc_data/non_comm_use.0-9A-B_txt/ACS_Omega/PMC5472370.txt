An approach to identify β-secretase
1 (BACE1) fragment binders
that do not interact with the catalytic aspartate dyad is presented.
A ThermoFluor (thermal shift) and a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer enzymatic screen on the soluble domain of BACE1, together
with a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screen on the soluble domain
of BACE1 and a mutant of one catalytic Asp (D32N), were run in parallel.
Fragments that were active in at least two of these assays were further
confirmed using one-dimensional NMR (WaterLOGSY) and SPR binding competition
studies with peptidic inhibitor OM99-2. Protein-observed NMR (two-dimensional 15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectroscopy) and
crystallographic studies with the soluble domain of BACE1 identified
a unique and novel binding mode for compound 12, a fragment
that still occupies the active site while not making any interactions
with catalytic Asps. This novel approach of combining orthogonal fragment
screening techniques, for both wild-type and mutant enzymes, as well
as binding competition studies could be generalized to other targets
to overcome undesired interaction motifs and as a hit-generation approach
in highly constrained intellectual property space.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative
disorder
and a massive societal burden.1,2 Available treatments
only provide a modest delay of the cognitive decline.3 Considerable research efforts aim to intervene in disease
progression.4−6 Among these, inhibition of β-secretase 1 (BACE1)
is the most studied since its discovery in 1999.7−10 The approach prevents the cleavage
of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) into neurotoxic Aβ40–42 peptide products, which aggregate to form the
extracellular amyloid plaques found in the AD brains.11 Genetic evidence also supports BACE1 as a target for AD.12

BACE1 is a membrane-anchored aspartic
protease with three domains:
an N-terminal ectodomain, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic
C-terminus. The catalytic ectodomain has an aspartic protease fold,
with the substrate-binding cleft located between the N- and C-terminal
lobes (Figure 1). The
crucial catalytic aspartate (Asp) dyad, D32 and D228, is located at
the interface of the two lobes.7 A hairpin
loop “flap” in the N-terminal lobe partially covers
the cleft in a perpendicular orientation. The conformational changes
in the flap control the substrate access to the active site, and open
to closed conformations have been observed in crystal structures of
BACE1.13,14 Loops C, D, and F in the C-lobe of the ectodomain
are the epitopes for binding of a known antibody.15

Figure 1 BACE1 (PDB 1XN3) in ribbon representation with the N-terminal lobe in dark gray,
C-terminal lobe in light gray, active site with the catalytic Asp
dyad in yellow, flap in orange, and 10S loop in green. The substrate-binding
cleft is shown as a surface together with the location of subpockets
S1, S2, S3, S4, S1′, S2′, S3′, and S4′.

The first BACE1 inhibitors were
substrate analogues that mimicked
the APP-cleavage sequence with a noncleavable peptide bond. They displayed
high in vitro potency but typically had poor oral bioavailability
and low brain penetration.16−18 The discovery of amidine moieties
that form optimal interactions with the Asp dyad revolutionized the
field of BACE1 inhibitors, as improved drug likeness became possible.19 These Asp-binding amidine and guanidine motifs
have been widely explored (Chart 1A),19 including studies
conducted in our labs (compounds 1, 3, and 4).20−25 Compound 1 was reported to bend back, allowing the
distal N-cyclohexyl group to occupy the S1 pocket,
whereas the central cyclohexyl occupied the lipophilic S1′
pocket. Compounds 2 and 3 on the other hand
contain a quaternary sp3 carbon, which provides an ideal
vector into the S1–S3 and S2′ pockets of the catalytic
site (Figure 1).26 Although a step forward, the basicity of the
amidine/guanidine function provides a formal positive charge, impacting
the optimization of physicochemical parameters. In contrast, there
are a few known ligands that bind to the catalytic cleft without interacting
with the Asp dyad. Pyrimidine 6 was reported by Merck
to bind to the S1 and S3 pockets27 (Chart 1B), and dihydroisoquinolines 7 and 8 were reported by Elan Pharmaceuticals28−30 to bind to the S2 pocket. Hence, the drawbacks of amidine inhibitors
and the limited intellectual property (IP) space spurred our interest
to seek alternatives to binding at the Asp dyad.

Fragment-based drug
discovery has now become an accepted strategy
for hit finding in drug discovery.31,32 The principle
is that structurally smaller “fragment-like” hits (generally
MW below 250 D or ∼21 heavy atoms) can be evolved into more
optimal binders with superior properties than those of traditional
high-throughput screen (HTS) hits. Because of their few but optimal
interactions, fragment hits typically have low affinity in the high
micromolar or low millimolar range. Hence, fragment screens are often
performed at similar concentration ranges using sensitive biophysical
techniques, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), ThermoFluor (TF),
ligand-observed NMR, and sometimes X-ray screening. Although normally
the throughput is lower than that of biochemical HTS assays, the fragment
space is exponentially smaller, requiring only thousands of fragments
to cover a similar chemistry space, than that in HTS decks
of hundreds of thousands of compounds.33 Fragments are more likely progressed to leads when the activity
is confirmed by orthogonal screening techniques, and also knowing
the binding mode via crystallography can be crucial to improve potency.
Numerous BACE1 leads have evolved from fragment screening,34 most binding to the catalytic Asp dyad, for
instance those from Edwards et al. (Chart 1, compound 2).24 Hence, fragment screening can be successful, but careful
consideration is needed to overcome the contemporary challenges of
BACE1 inhibition. Here, we applied orthogonal screening approaches,
leading to the identification of a non-Asp-binding fragment, for which
a crystal structure was obtained showing a distinct and previously
undescribed binding mode.

Results and Discussion
Overview of the Approach
We defined a strategy to identify
the fragments that do not interact with the catalytic Asps, Figure 2. An SPR screen of
the Janssen Fragment Library (JFL) was conducted at two pH values
using the Biacore 4000 system with the mature BACE1 ectodomain and
neutravidin (reference protein) immobilized. In parallel, TF and enzymatic
FRET assays were run at high compound concentration. These allowed
additional triage and permitted us to identify false positives from
the SPR screen. The hits were further characterized in a new SPR screen
by assessing their binding in the presence of the potent peptidomimetic
inhibitor, OM99-2 (FRET IC50, 4.38 nM; SPR Kd, 12.7 nM),35 known to occupy
most subpockets of wild-type (WT) BACE1 and the active-site mutant
D32N. This approach provided additional information on the binding
site and discriminated only the most promising fragments. Hits with
an attractive structure and desired binding profile were then confirmed
by WaterLOGSY,36 and the actives were submitted
to protein-observed 1H–15N TROSY NMR
and/or X-ray crystallography.37

non-Asp-binding fragments to BACE1.

Fragment Library
High-concentration screens often render
assays sensitive to false positives resulting from minor impurities
in the screening samples.38 Janssen R&D
has therefore invested in a fragment collection in which all compounds
have been analyzed by LC/MS with UV or CLND detection and their dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions have been analyzed for structure plausibility
by NMR using the Bruker CMC-Q software. The purity threshold in LC/MS
and NMR was set to 95% and above. Fragments with 8–21 heavy
atoms were selected from both our screening deck and internally synthesized
intermediates or final compounds. These were stored in 100, 50, or
20 mM DMSO solutions depending on the solubility. The library was
constructed on the basis of criteria such as 2D shape, 2D fingerprint,
and scaffold diversity. Similarities to both the known drugs and the
number of sp3 centers were also promoted in the selection
process. The size of the JFL used in this study was 1120 compounds.

SPR Screen
For SPR-based fragment screening, the mature
BACE1 ectodomain was immobilized on a CM7 sensor chip together with
neutravidin (reference). First, all fragments were tested for promiscuous
binding, that is, showing nonspecific interaction with the target
and/or reference protein, resulting in high baseline increase or decrease,
or showing irregular sensorgram shapes. Nine fragments were removed
from the JFL due to promiscuous binding. Next, the JFL was screened
in duplicate using a compound concentration of 0.25 mM at both pHs
7.4 and 4.5 because Dominguez et al. demonstrated that BACE1 inhibitors
binding well at acidic and neutral pH values could be optimal cellular
inhibitors as they maintain interaction with BACE1 throughout the
transport from the neutral extracellular environment through to the
acidic endosome.39 Concentration-reponse
(CR) curves were subsequently generated for hits at either pH value
or both pH values.

TF Screen
Thermal shift analysis
of the mature BACE1
ectodomain was used to estimate binding affinities by measuring the
effect of a ligand on protein stability using thermal denaturation.40,41 The JFL was tested in duplicate at a single concentration (2.1,
0.8, or 0.2 mM based on the respective haystack DMSO concentration
of 100, 50, or 20 mM). Fragments showing a significant ΔTm shift compared to the average protein-only
control value were confirmed by CR curves.

Enzymatic Screen
BACE1 enzymatic activity was assessed
by a FRET assay using a mature BACE1 ectodomain. An APP-derived 13
amino acid substrate containing the “Swedish” Lys-Met/Asn-Leu
mutation at the cleavage site was employed. 7-Methoxycoumarin-4-yl
acetic acid (MCA ) was the fluorescent donor, and 2,4-dinitrophenyl
(DNP) was the acceptor. The 100, 50, and 20 mM haystack samples of
the JFL were first screened at 33.3-fold dilution, hence at 3.0, 1.5,
and 0.6 mM, respectively. Hits with ≥49% inhibition were subsequently
tested twice by CR curves. Autofluorescent compounds (sample at T0
minus mean control at T0 > 3 × σ) were removed.

SPR Competition
and Mutant BACE1 Experiments
To identify
fragment binding in the vicinity of the Asp’s, a competition
between OM99-2 and the mature BACE1 ectodomain was performed with
six overlapping hits from the prior assays. In addition, SPR binding
experiments versus the D32N mutant allowed us to identify the catalytic
Asp binding fragments. Fragment 10 was not tested because
of its nonspecific binding behavior at pH 4.5 (very slow on/off rate
constants).

Hit Analysis
The outcome from the
three orthogonal
primary assays, SPR, TF, and enzymatic FRET, is presented in Figure 3 and the corresponding
data in Table 1. The
criteria for hit selection were as follows: SPR hits showed a specific
and concentration-dependent binding at one or both pHs; TF hits gave
a ΔTm shift >0.5 °C at the
highest concentration with no sign of autofluorescence; and FRET hits
showed a robust CR curve and no autofluorescence. Of the three approaches,
FRET gave 87 hits in total (7.8%), but a majority (81, 92%) did not
confirm in other assays. Because of its high sensitivity, SPR gave
the highest hit rate (159 hits: 77 at pH 7.4 and 106 at pH 4.5, with
an overlap of 24 hits), with only 6 confirmed in other assays. Finally,
TF gave the lowest amount of hits (2, 0.18%), but both confirmed in
SPR and FRET. The structures of hits confirmed in at least two assays
are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Hits identified across different fragment screens.

Four compounds (9–12) showed SPR and enzymatic
activity but no thermal shift (Figure 3 and Table 1). Of these, 9 bound to both WT and mutant BACE1
but also showed reduced binding in the presence of OM99-2, suggesting
interaction with the catalytic Asp’s. Fragment 9 contains a known guanidine motif42 and
hence did not fit our criteria of novelty. Why 9 binds
to the BACE1 D32N mutant despite its guanidine substructure remains
elusive, but it may be indicative of nonspecific binding despite our
efforts to filter out such false positives. The other fragments with
overlapping SPR and FRET activity, 10–12, were
not previously reported to bind to BACE1. Fragment 10 bound to the BACE1 D32N mutant alone and in the presence of OM99-2,
suggesting binding outside the catalytic site. Interestingly, fragments 11 and 12 do not display any known Asp-binding
motif, bound to the BACE1 D32N mutant, and showed reduced binding
in the presence of OM99-2. This strongly suggested that they bind
to the active site without interaction with the catalytic Asps. The
sensorgrams of 12 show binding in the absence (red) and
presence (green) of OM99-2 and to the BACE1 D32N mutant (Figure 4). Finally, only
two hits were confirmed in all three assays: 13 and 14. However, 14 is an intermediate from a BACE1
medicinal chemistry exploration,23 whereas 13 is a structurally related but much weaker binding compound
synthesized for an unrelated project. For fragments 13 and 14, KD’s of
respectively 0.83 and 0.12 mM could be calculated from the TF CR data.
In SPR, 14 bound strongly to the mature BACE1 ectodomain
but, in contrast to 13, lost binding to the BACE1 D32N
mutant (Figure 4C).
Binding of 14 was also drastically reduced in the presence
of OM99-2 (Figure 4A).

mutant. The compounds were tested in CR series (0.03, 0.06, 0.13,
0.25, 0.50 mM).

WaterLOGSY
In
the preparation of eventual heteronuclear
single-quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) experiments, the binding
of selected hits (9–12 and 14) was
confirmed using WaterLOGSY, a ligand-observed NMR binding assessment
technique (Table 1).
A 30-fold excess of ligand was used at physiological pH. Experiments
were repeated at pH 4.5.43 Fragment 9 showed a very intense positive peak at pH 7.5, and also
clear positive signals were observed for 10 and 12. Signals for 11 and 14 were negative
under these conditions. Nevertheless, when the experiments were repeated
at acidic pH, a strong positive signal was obtained for 14, whereas 11 remained negative.

Protein-Observed NMR
The partial assignment of amino
acids in the mature BACE1 ectodomain via 15N-HSQC has been
reported.44 This technique was used to
further characterize the binding of fragments 10 and 12 to BACE1 and as a selection criterion for X-ray crystallography.
Being a known Asp binder, 14 was selected as a reference.
Compound 9 and 13 were discarded given their
similarity to previously reported hits, and 11 was excluded
on the basis of WaterLOGSY experiments. BACE1 was labeled with 15N as necessary for the 15N-HSQC 2D experiment.
The TROSY approach was employed as it produced better resolution,
which is beneficial given the signal broadening and overlap in the
spectra typically seen for large proteins. Most of the reported assignment
could be annotated at the corresponding NH signals. A 5-fold excess
of ligand was added to a 0.1 mM protein sample. To visualize shift
changes upon interaction between the ligand and protein, the combined
shift difference was calculated from the chemical shift differences
in the nitrogen and the proton dimension, using the following formula.  The 2D-HSQC results of 12 and 14 are shown
in Figure 5. Amino
acids from mature 15N-labeled BACE1 that
experience changes upon interaction are displayed on the X axis, and the combined shift difference in parts per million (ppm)
is represented on the Y axis. As expected, amino
acids Asp32 and Asp228 were affected by the binding of 14, as well as neighboring amino acids Gly34 and Gly120. Interestingly, 12 affected different amino acids compared to 14. The shifts are visualized on the surface of the BACE1 protein extracted
from the co-crystal with lead compound 4 (PDB 5CLM; Figure 6). Whereas 14 affected
the two catalytic Asp’s (shown in pink, adjacent to the amidine
substructure, Figure 6A), 12 did not (Figure 6B). Instead, shifts were observed for multiple amino
acids in the protein, with some close to the binding site such as
Leu121, Arg128, Thr329, and Gly334. Unfortunately, a large number
of amino acids in the active site were not assigned; therefore, the
exact position of 12 could not be determined by NMR.
In the case of 10, the observed chemical shift changes
were much lower than those for compound 12 and no significant
differences with 14 could be detected (data not shown).

The assigned amino acids are shown in yellow. The structure of 4 is shown in green in (A) and (C).

Crystallography
Following the various primary assays
and follow-up work, 12 emerged as the strongest candidate
for attempting crystallography. Pleasingly, the screening, detailed
analysis, and prioritization paid dividends as the crystal structure
of 12 with BACE1 was readily solved at 2.5 Å resolution
(PDB code 5MXD, Figure 7A). There
are three copies of the BACE1–inhibitor complex in the crystallographic
asymmetric unit, with each showing a similar binding mode of 12. The flexible active-site flap containing Tyr71 adopts
different orientations in the three monomers.

Figure 7 Interactions of 12 (A), interaction map of 12 (B), a comparison
between the binding modes of 12 and
Asp binder 4 (C), and a comparison of the binding modes
of non-Asp binders 6 (magenta), 8 (green),
and 12 (cyan) (D).

In contrast to that in most known BACE1 inhibitors, such
as 4, no interaction between 12 and the
catalytic
Asp dyad (Asp32 and Asp228) either directly or via a water-mediated
network was seen (Figure 7C).23 Instead, the quinazoline
occupies the S1 pocket and the dimethylamine is oriented toward S3.
Fragment 12 forms an H-bond between the protonated quinazoline
and the backbone carbonyl of Phe108 in two of the three copies of
BACE1 and forms π-stacking and hydrophobic interactions with
residues Leu30, Tyr71, Phe108, Ile110, Trp115, and Ile118 (Figure 7B). The pyrolidine
ring goes into a new, more-solvent-exposed subpocket. The distance
between the nitrogen of the dimethylamine and the carbonyl of Gly230
is too long to form a strong hydrogen bond (3.4–3.9 Å
in the three copies).

Figure 7D compares
the structures of reported non-Asp binders 6 and 8 to BACE1 with that of 12. Inhibitor 6 occupies a similar region but has some differences.27 It also forms a H-bond with the carbonyl of Phe108; however,
a sulfonamide is oriented toward S3 compared with the dimethylamine
in 12. The dihydroisoquinolines 7 and 8 do not interact with Phe108 but, instead, form an H-bond
network in S2, compensating for the absence of interaction with the
catalytic Asp dyad.28,29

Conclusions
Fragment
screening with SPR, TF, and enzymatic FRET approaches
delivered six hits, confirmed in at least two assays, and two in all
three. The use of the BACE1 D32N mutant identified fragments that
bind to BACE1 but not via Asp interactions. Further SPR competition
experiments with OM99-2 helped in selecting those that bind to the
catalytic cleft. After confirming binding
by NMR (WaterLOGSY), protein-observed NMR using 15N-labeled
BACE1 led to the prioritization of 12 for X-ray crystallography,
which revealed a unique binding mode in the S2 pocket of BACE1. This
orthogonal screening cascade along with mutant and competition experiments
is a valid general approach for finding novel ligands for drug discovery
targets, especially when the IP space is dominated by similar chemical
motifs. In addition, this orthogonal screening paradigm maximizes
the chance to obtain X-ray structures of such ligands with unusual
binding modes.

Methods
Proteins
The mature
BACE1 ectodomain protein (amino
acid residues −16 to 393) with a COOH-terminal 6xHis-tag (denoted
“mature BACE1 ectodomain” throughout the article) was
expressed by baculovirus infection of HighFive insect cells and purified
from the cell culture supernatant using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography,
anion exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography essentially
as described by Bruinzeel et al.45 The
mature BACE1 ectodomain catalytic-site mutant (D32N) protein (amino
acid residues −16 to 393) with a COOH-terminal 6xHis-tag and
StrepII-tag was expressed in and purified from E. coli cells by the Protein Service Facility of the University of Ghent.46 The only difference between the WT and mutant
forms of the protein (apart from the mutation) is the somewhat longer
tag at the COOH-terminus of the mutant form (only 9 amino acid residues
for His-tag vs 21 amino acid residues for His- + Strep-tag). The BACE1
ectodomain has been tagged at the COOH-terminus in many studies, and
no apparent effect on its activity or conformation has been described.
Although an experimental effect of the tag and/or the difference in
length between the tags cannot be excluded, it is highly unlikely.
For 15N-HSQC NMR experiments, labeled BACE1 (amino acid
residues −16 to 393) was expressed in minimal medium with 15NH4Cl from E. coli cells and purified by ion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography
by the Structural Biochemistry Laboratory of the CIPF.47

FRET
Primary BACE1 enzymatic activity
was assessed
by a FRET assay using an APP-derived 13 amino acids peptide, that
contains the “Swedish” Lys-Met/Asn-Leu mutation of the
APP β-secretase cleavage site, as a substrate (MCA -Ser-Glu-Val-Asn-Leu-Asp-Ala-Glu-Phe-Arg-Lys(DNP)-Arg-Arg-NH2 TFA salt, Bachem cat No. M-2465) and a mature BACE1 ectodomain
(Aurigene, custom-made). The substrate contains fluorophore MCA as
a fluorescent donor with excitation wavelength at 320 nm and emission
wavelength at 405 nm and proprietary quencher acceptor DNP. The distance
between these two groups has been selected so that upon light excitation
the donor fluorescence energy is significantly quenched by the acceptor,
through resonance energy transfer. Upon cleavage by BACE1, MCA is
separated from DNP, restoring the full fluorescence yield of the donor.
The increase in fluorescence is linearly related to the rate of proteolysis.
In a 384-well format, BACE1 is incubated for 2 h with the substrate
and the inhibitor. The amount of proteolysis is directly measured
by fluorescence measurement in the Fluoroskan microplate fluorometer
(Thermo Scientific). For the low control, no enzyme was added to the
reaction mixture. The enzymatic BACE1 FRET assay was performed in
a total volume of 30 μL in a buffer containing 33.3 mM citrate,
pH 5.0; 0.033% PEG; 10 μM substrate; 32.4 nM BACE1; and the
compound. Compound stock solutions in 100% DMSO were diluted, 1/33.3,
in the reaction mixture, resulting in final DMSO concentrations of
4% (3% from compound, 1% from substrate).

SPR
Measurements
were performed using a Biacore 4000
instrument and CM7 biosensor chips (GE Healthcare). The mature BACE1
ectodomain and neutravidin both were immobilized by amine coupling
using standard procedures and materials provided by GE Healthcare.
A mixture of Hepes (10 mM), pH 7.4, NaCl (150 mM; HBS-N), and 0.005%
Tween 20 was used as the running buffer during immobilization. Interaction
experiments were performed at 25 °C at both pH 7.4 (running buffer
HBS-N, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% DMSO) and pH 4.5 (running
buffer 10 mM NaOAc, pH 4.5, with 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and
5% DMSO). Fragments and reference compounds were injected for 30 s
over the sensor surface at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. DMSO solvent
correction was performed using calibration points containing between
2.5 and 6.5% DMSO. Binding response of reference compounds was followed
during the fragment screen to determine potential decrease in the
apparent analyte binding capacity of BACE1, which was compensated
for in the data analysis. Data analysis has been performed using the
Biacore 4000 Control and Evaluation software and Excel. Fragments
were screened twice (forward and reverse order) at 0.25 mM and at
pH 7.4 and 4.5 against BACE1, neutravidin, and a blank reference spot
to identify and discard promiscuous binders. For the primary screen,
fragments have been tested at 0.25 mM in duplicate both at pH 7.4
and 4.5. Top 10% screening hits were retested by CR curves, ranging
between 0.03 and 0.500 mM (8 concentrations with 1.5-fold dilution
range). Competition experiments (pH 4.5) were performed by injection
of fragment hits before and after injection of the OM99-2 peptide
(Calbiochem, 496000). Immobilization and SPR measurements using the
BACE1 D32N mutant were performed under the conditions similar to those
used for WT BACE1.

ThermoFluor
The BACE1 ThermoFluor
assay was performed
in 384-well plates in a total volume of 4 μL in a buffer containing
50 mM NaOAc pH 5.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.0005% Tween 20, 100 μM ANS,
1.6 μM mature BACE1 ectodomain protein and compound. Compound
stock solutions in 100% DMSO were diluted 1/24 in the reaction, resulting
in final compound concentrations of 2.1, 0.80, or 0.2 mM (depending
on the initial compound stock concentration) and a final DMSO concentration
of 4.2%. Thermal shift measurements were done in a ThermoFluor instrument
from 25 to 85 °C in 1 °C increments. Fluorescence at every
temperature was determined using a charge-coupled device camera and
subsequent image analysis using proprietary software.

WaterLOGSY
and Protein-Observed NMR
All NMR experiments
were performed using a Bruker Avance II 600 MHz spectrometer equipped
with a 5 mm inverse cryoprobe at 27 °C. For WaterLOGSY experiments,
to 480 μL of 5 μM mature BACE1 ectodomain, 20 μL
of D2O and 0.15 mM of ligand were added (from a 100 mM
stock in DMSO-d6), in a protein/ligand
ratio of 1:30, optimal for the WaterLOGSY experiments. For each sample,
1D 1H and WaterLOGSY experiments were conducted. A total of 32 K-points were used for a sweep width of 14 ppm, and a total
of 128 scans were accumulated for the WaterLOGSY experiment. For 15N-HSQC NMR experiments, protein samples were concentrated
to 0.10 mM, and 0.02 mL of D2O and 0.50 mM of ligand were
added (from a 100 mM stock in DMSO-d6)
to 0.48 mL of protein sample. The TROSY version of 15N-HSQC
with sensitivity enhancement was acquired with 200 scans, spectral
widths of 14 and 40 ppm and offsets of 4.7 and 117 ppm in the 1H and the 15N dimension, respectively. Spectra
were acquired and processed with Topspin 3.2 (Bruker Biospin), and
2D experiments were integrated with Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G.
Kneller; SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco).

Crystal
Structure Experimental Data
A structure of 12 in BACE1 (1–454) was obtained by Proteros Biostructures
GmbH.48 X-ray crystallography data collection
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2, and refinement statistics are summarized
in Table 3. Human BACE-1
(amino acids 22–446 preceded by MetHis6; numbering as in UniProtKB
entry P56817) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) in inclusion bodies. Briefly, inclusion bodies were refolded
from 8 M urea and further purified by ion-exchange and gel-filtration
chromatography. After the removal of the propeptide by digestion with
clostripain, the noncleaved material was removed by NiNTA chromatography
and the protein was finally subjected to ion-exchange chromatography.
For crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 23 mg/mL, flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further
use.

For crystallization, the protein at 10 mg/mL was incubated
for
1 h on ice with 2 mM of the ligand (diluted from 100 mM DMSO stock
in the protein solution). The protein was crystallized from 12% (m/v)
PEG4000, 100 mM MES/NaOH, pH 5.5, by hanging-drop vapor diffusion
at 20 °C (0.75 μL protein + 0.75 μL reservoir solution).
For cryoprotection, crystals were briefly soaked in reservoir solution
mixed with 25% (v/v) glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at the SLS (beamline PXI/X06SA)
using a PILATUS 6M detector. Data were integrated, scaled, and merged
using XDS.49 The structure was refined
with REFMAC5.50 Manual model completion
was carried out using Coot.51 The quality
of the final model was verified by PROCHECK52 and the validation tools available through Coot.51

from Specs and Biospecs (CAS# 43182-10-1) and has been described before.53 Compound 11 was obtained from the
internal compound collection and has been previously reported.54

Analytical Methods
All final compounds
were characterized
by 1H NMR and LC/MS and were >95% pure by 1H
NMR. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers:
DPX-360 MHz, AVI-500 MHz, and AVI-600 MHz. For 1H NMR spectra,
all chemical shifts are reported in ppm (δ) units and are relative
to the residual signal at 7.26 and 2.50 ppm for CHCl3 and
DMSO, respectively. Different LC/MS methods were used to characterize
the products. LC/MS method A. Instrument: Waters Alliance HT 2790

7-Bromo-1-piperazin-1-yl-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine
(10). 7-Bromo-1-chloro-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine (0.4 g, 1.7 mmol, CAS 1597913-29-5), 1-Boc-piperazine (0.633
g, 3.4 mmol, CAS 143238-38-4) and K2CO3 (0.47
g, 3.4 mmol) in ACN (7.5 mL) were heated in a microwave oven for 15
min at 170 °C. Then, additional 1-Boc-piperazine (0.633 g, 3.4
mmol, CAS 143238-38-4) was added and the reaction was heated at 180
°C for 45 min. After cooling to rt, DCM was added, the solid
was filtered off, and the filtrate solvent was evaporated affording
1.0 g of intermediate 10-1 (100%).

Intermediate 10-1 (1.0 g, 1.7 mmol) in 6 N HCl/2-propanol
(10 mL) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature (rt). Then, DCM and
aqueous saturated Na2CO3 were added. The organic
layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered,
and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was purified by column
chromatography (eluent: DCM/(7 N NH3 in MeOH), 96:4), affording
430 mg of compound 10 (90%). 1H NMR (600 MHz,
DMSO-d6): δ ppm 2.78–2.85

(12). Dimethylamine (2 M solution in THF, 22.6 mL, 45.22
mmol, CAS 607-68-1) was added dropwise to a slurry of 2,4-dichloroquinazoline
(3000 mg, 15.07 mmol) in THF (10 mL)/water (15 mL). The resulting
mixture was stirred for 17 h at rt and then poured into water and
extracted with EtOAc (3 × 75 mL). The combined extracts were
dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo, yielding
intermediate 12-1 as a bright white powder (3.16 g, 100%).
LC/MS (method C); rt 0.84 min, MH+ 208.

A MW-vessel
was charged with intermediate 12-1 (0.25
g, 1.20 mmol), pyrrolidine (301 μL, 3.61 mmol), and ACN (5 mL).
This mixture was stirred and heated under MW irradiation at 110 °C
for 30 min. Next, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and
purified using RP-HPLC (RP Shandon Hyperprep C18 BDS – 10 μm,
250 g, 5 cm, mobile phase (0.25% NH4HCO3 solution
in water, MeOH + ACN)). The desired fractions were concentrated in
vacuo and co-evaporated twice with MeOH at 60 °C. An off-white
solid was obtained, which was dissolved in 10 mL of DCM. This solution
was then treated with NaOH (1 mL, 1 M), dried over an Isolute HM-N
tube, and rinsed with 10 mL of DCM. The collected solution was evaporated
at 50 °C under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was dissolved
in 15 mL of DCM, and 1.5 equiv of HCl (6 N in 2-propanol) was added
dropwise. The obtained solution was then stirred for 1 h. The white
crystals were collected on a filter, rinsed with 10 mL of DCM, and
dried in a vacuum oven at 55 °C for 24 h, yielding compound 12 (242 mg, 83%) as a white powder. 1H NMR (600
MHz, DMSO-d6):

min, MH+ 243.

2-(1-Naphthyl)-3,6-dihydro-2H-1,4-oxazin-5-amine
(13). Zinc(II) iodide (0.025 g, 0.078 mmol) was added
to 1-naphthaldehyde (36.4 g, 0.233 mol, CAS 66-77-3), and the resulting
mixture was cooled with ice. Next, TMSCN (25 g, 0.252 mol) was added
dropwise. When the addition was complete, the mixture was brought
to 25 °C. After the reaction was judged complete (thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) monitoring), the mixture was diluted with DCM
and washed with an aqueous saturated NaHCO3 solution. The
organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered,
and concentrated to provide intermediate 13-1 as a red-orange
oil that solidified upon standing (59.97 g, 100%).

In a three-necked
flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and addition
funnel, LiAlH4 (9.90 g, 0.261 mol) was suspended in dry
diethyl ether (205 mL) under nitrogen flow. Next, intermediate 13-1 (59.50 g, 0.233 mol) dissolved in 75 mL dry diethyl ether
was added dropwise. When the addition was complete, the reaction was
stirred at rt until judged complete by TLC monitoring (about 2 days).
Next, 10 mL water was added dropwise, followed by 10 mL of a 15% NaOH
solution. Then, 29.7 mL of water was again added carefully. The mixture
was further stirred until a precipitate was formed, which was filtered
over dicalite. The filtrate was concentrated, providing intermediate 13-2 as a bright orange-red oil (13.9 g, 32%).

Intermediate 13-2 (13.8 g, 0.737 mol) was dissolved
in 500 mL dry DCM. Triethylamine (14.9 g, 0.147 mol) was added, and
the resulting solution was cooled with ice. Next, chloroacetyl chloride
(9.99 g, 0.0884 mol) was added dropwise, and after addition, the reaction
mixture was allowed to warm to rt. After the reaction was judged complete
(TLC monitoring), the mixture was poured into 1 N HCl (500 mL). The
organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with
DCM (3 × 250 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The
residue was purified over silica gel using CHCl3 as eluent.
The product fractions were evaporated, yielding intermediate 13-3 as a beige foam (6.10 g, 31%).

Sodium hydride (60%
dispersion in mineral oil, 1.85 g, 0.463 mmol)
was washed with dry hexanes, and then, 76 mL of dry 2-propanol was
added. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2.5 h at 25 °C.
Next, intermediate 13-3 (6.10 g, 0.0232 mol) in 78 mL
of 2-propanol was added. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight
at 25 °C. Then, the reaction was quenched by pouring the mixture into 110 mL
of ice-water containing HOAc (1.30 mL, 0.0232 mol). The mixture was
extracted with CHCl3 (2 × 250 mL). The combined organic
layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated
to dryness. The residue was purified over silica gel using CHCl3/MeOH (99:1) as eluent, yielding intermediate 13-4 (2.88 g, 55%).

Boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (1.34 g,
0,00944 mol) was dissolved
in 5.6 mL of dry diethyl ether. Epichlorohydrin (0.68 g, 0.00726 mol)
was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at 25 °C.
Next, the ether was decanted and the residue was washed with ether.
DCM (11 mL) was added to the residue, and intermediate 13-4 (1.65 g, 0.00726 mol) in 11 mL DCM was subsequently added. The resulting
mixture was stirred overnight at 25 °C, after which all volatiles
were evaporated, providing intermediate 13-5 as a light
yellow foam, which was carried as such to the next reaction step.

Intermediate 13-5 (crude from previous step, approx.
0.00726 mol) was dissolved in 15.6 mL of NH3 in MeOH (7
N, 0.109 mol), and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at
rt. Next, 1 N NaOH (50 mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted
with CHCl3 (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers
were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated.
Diethyl ether was added to the residue, followed by concentrated HCl
(0.61 mL, 0.00726 mol). The resulting precipitate was filtered, and
recrystallized from MeOH/Et2O, yielding compound 13 as a white solid (0.66 g, 46% two steps). 1H

and DIPEA (1.37 mL, 7.94 mmol) in THF (40 mL) at −10 °C
was added chloroacetyl chloride (0.527 mL, 6.61 mmol) dropwise. Then,
the mixture was left stirring while slowly warming up to −5
°C for 20 min. Then, t-BuOK (1.86 g, 16.53 mmol) was added portionwise,
and the mixture was left warming up slowly to 5–10 °C
for 60 min. Then, the reaction was quenched with 10% aq. NH4Cl and extracted with DCM. The organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, evaporated, and purified by automated
flash silica column (eluent: DCM/EtOAc, gradient 1:0 to 7:3), giving
intermediate 14-1 as a transparent oil (870 mg, 69%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, chloroform-d): δ ppm

Intermediate 14-1 (400 mg, 2.092 mmol) and P2S5 (511 mg, 2.301
mmol) were dissolved in THF (15 mL),
and
the mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 30 min. Then, the mixture
was cooled to rt and filtered over cotton and evaporated. The residue
was dissolved in DCM and directly injected into a flash silica column,
eluting with DCM. Evaporation of the product fractions provided intermediate 14-2 as a yellow oil (360 mg, 83%). 1H NMR (500
MHz, chloroform-d): δ ppm 1.75 (s, 3H), 3.79
(d, J = 11.6 Hz, 1H), 3.84 (d, J = 11.6 Hz, 1H), 4.58 (d, J = 18.5 Hz, 1H), 4.65

Intermediate 14-2 (340 mg, 1.64 mmol) was dissolved
in NH4OH (15 mL), and the mixture was stirred at rt overnight
and then for 11 h at 40 °C. Then, water and DCM were added, the
organic layer was separated, and the aqueous layer was further extracted
with DCM (3×). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated. Then, DCM (15 mL)
and TFA (0.25 mL) were added, mixed well, and evaporated. Et2O (20 mL) was added to the residue and sonicated. This formed a white
precipitate, which was filtered and washed with Et2O and
dried. Then, this product was further purified by automated flash
silica column (eluent (1% TFA in DCM)/MeOH; gradient 100:0 to 95:5).
The fractions containing the product were collected and evaporated,
and the residue was precipitated in Et2O, filtered, and
dried in vacuo. This gave intermediate 14 as a white
solid (310 mg, 62%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ ppm 1.63 (s, 3H), 3.87 (d, J = 11.8 Hz, 1H), 3.93 (d, J = 12.1 Hz, 1H), 4.53–4.61
