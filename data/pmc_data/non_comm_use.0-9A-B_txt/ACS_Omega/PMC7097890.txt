Because of poor water
solubility and low thermostability, the application
of collagen is limited seriously in fields such as injectable biomaterials
and cosmetics. In order to overcome the two drawbacks simultaneously,
a novel bifunctional modifier based on the esterification of polyacrylic
acid (PAA) with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) was prepared.
The esterification degree of PAA-NHS esters was increased upon increasing
the NHS dose, which was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrascopy. FTIR results indicated
that the triple helix of the modified collagens remained integrated,
whereas the molecular weight became larger, as reflected by the sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern.
The modified collagens displayed excellent water solubility under
neutral condition, owing to lower isoelectric point (3.1–4.3)
than that of native collagen (7.1). Meanwhile, denaturation temperatures
of the modified collagens were increased by 4.8–5.9 °C
after modification. The modified collagen displayed hierarchical microstructures,
as reflected by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, while
atomic force microscopy further revealed a “fishing net-like”
network in the nanoscale, reflecting a unique aggregation behavior
of collagen macromolecules after modification. As a whole, the PAA-NHS
ester as a bifunctional modifier endowed collagen with desired water
solubility and thermostability in a conflict-free manner, which was
beneficial to the process and application of the water-soluble collagen.

==== Body
Introduction
Collagen, the main structural protein
accounting for approximately
one-third of all vertebrate body protein, is typically found in fibrous
tissues such as tendons, skin, cartilages, bones, corneas, blood vessels,
and ligaments.1,2 Nowadays, collagen is regarded
as one of the most useful biomaterials as exemplified by current biomedical
application such as surgery, prosthetic systems, pharmacology, drug
formulation, and delivery3,4 due to excellent biocompatibility,
safe biological characteristics, high mechanical strength, and weak
antigenicity.5−7

Generally, native collagen has an isoelectric
point (pI) near neutral
pH, which means that it has poor water solubility under physiological
conditions,8,9 resulting in the restrictions of application
when used in the format of solution. In order to dissolve collagen
into water to obtain a clear solution, traditionally anhydride was
used as a modifier to decrease the pI via the introduction of carboxyl
groups to collagen molecules. Another defect of native collagen is
the weak thermostability (native collagen would be denatured at a
temperature near 38 °C which is reported previously10). For the sake of strengthening the structural
stability of collagen, a mass of methods include physical treating
such as UV-light irradiation11,12 and chemicals or enzymes
such as glutaraldehyde,13 formaldehyde,14 hexamethylene diisocyanate,15 carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS),16 tannin,17 genipin,18 transglutaminase,19 and so forth have been exploited to form the cross-linking among
collagen molecules. However, acylation modification competes with
cross-linking modification because both of them consume ε-amino
groups of the collagen side chain in the course of the modification
process.20 To avoid this contradiction,
polycarboxylic acid with abundant free carboxyl groups has been used
as a kind of a desired bifunctional modifier candidate. Specially,
a collagen modifier can be prepared through the reaction between the
carboxyl groups of polycarboxylic acid and hydroxyl groups of NHS
to gain NHS-activated esters, which can react with the amino groups
of collagen to endow improved water solubility and thermostability
on collagen simultaneously.

Previously, we reported NHS-activated
γ-polyglutamic acid
esters (γ-PGA-NHS esters)9 and NHS-activated
hyaluronic acid esters (HA-NHS esters)21 as a kind of bifunctional modifiers for collagen. Nevertheless,
both γ-PGA (∼1000 kDa, respectively) and HA (∼24
kDa) had a molecular weight (MW) close to or even lower than that
of native collagen (300 kDa). In these systems, collagen molecules
were adjacent to each other, leading to the local attracting effect
which might cause a barrier for a desired dissolution in neutral pH.
Herein, we proposed that a polycarboxylic acid with a molecular weight
much larger than that of native collagen could be a feasible candidate
as a novel modifier to prepare water-soluble collagen. As a linear-chain
polymer, polyacrylic acid (PAA) has a lot of carboxyl groups on the
side chain just like γ-PGA or HA. Nevertheless, PAA used in
our work possessed a high MW of up to 30,000 kDa, which is about 100
times higher than that of collagen. In recent years, PAA has been
used as potential biomaterials because of its unique structure/function
and nontoxicity.22 For instance, Gomaa23 prepared a PAA-functionalized quantum dot conjugates
which was applied to detect biomolecules. It was shown that the conjugates
exhibited nontoxicity and were biocompatible; Ghavamzadeh24 reported the hydrogels consisted of gelatin
and PAA as biological glue for soft tissues, with an increased bonding
strength and reduced gelatin time. Attractively, no sign of toxicity
was observed in in vitro assays for the hydrogels. To the best of
our knowledge, PAA or its derivatives were rarely reported in the
modification of collagen.

In this work, PAA-NHS esters were
prepared and the structure was
characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Afterward, the native collagen was
modified using PAA-NHS esters to fabricate modified collagens, which
were characterized by a series of methods such as FTIR, sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), pI measurements,
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The synthesis
process of the PAA-NHS ester and its reaction mechanism with collagen
macromolecules are illustrated in Scheme 1. The results obtained confirmed that PAA-NHS
esters as a novel bifunctional modifier endowed collagen with good
water solubility and high thermostability simultaneously, which would
broaden the application range of collagen.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterizations of PAA-NHS Esters
The
FTIR spectra of PAA-NHS esters could be correlated to the backbone
conformation. Figure 1a shows the FTIR spectra of neat PAA and PAA-NHS esters. PAA shows
a strong and broad band at approximately 3415 cm–1 which was assigned to the stretching vibrations of O–H groups,
while the stretching vibrations of C–H groups was found at
about 2940 cm–1.25 The
absorption bands at ∼ 1707, 1573, and 1421 cm–1 could be attributed to C=O, COO–, and CH2,26 respectively. Nevertheless,
after esterification, the peak position of the stretching vibrations
of O–H groups transfers to higher wavenumber at 3445 cm–1, which indicated that the intensity of the hydrogen
interaction of the PAA-NHS ester became weaker. The peaks of PAA-NHS
esters at about 1240 and 1450 cm–1 could be attributed
to the vibration of C–N and CH2, respectively.9,27 Meanwhile, the new peak at 1780 cm–1 assigned
to the ester group was observed clearly from Figure 1b.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of PAA and PAA-NHS esters in the
range of 4000–400
cm–1 (a); FTIR spectra of PAA and PAA-NHS esters
in the range of 2100–1720 cm–1 (b); 1H NMR spectra of PAA and PAA-NHS esters (c); and the synthesis
mechanism of PAA-NHS ester (d).

1H NMR was further used as a quantitative method to
estimate the molecular structure and the esterification degree of
PAA-NHS esters. Figure 1c shows the 1H NMR spectra of PAA and PAA-NHS esters.
The peak at 1.24 ppm was attributed to the methylene protons of PAA,28 while the peak of the protons of NHS was at
about 2.60 ppm29 which verified that the
PAA-NHS esters were prepared successfully. Positively correlated between
the NHS/COOH molar ratios of 1/5, 1/2, 1/1, and 2/1, the esterification
degrees of PAA-NHS esters were calculated to be 11.1 ± 0.2%,
18.1 ± 0.3%, 31.2 ± 0.1%, 39.2 ± 0.1%, respectively. Figure 1d displays the synthesis
mechanism of the PAA-NHS ester via partial esterification of carboxyl
groups of PAA with NHS.

Molecular Structure of Collagens
Figure 2a shows the
FTIR spectra of the collagens.
The peak at about 3400 cm–1 was mainly associated
with the N–H stretching vibrations relating to amide A.30 The amide I band at about 1650 cm–1 was dominantly associated to the stretching vibrations of peptide
C=O groups, the amide II band located at about 1550 cm–1 was due to the bending vibrations of N–H groups,
and the amide III band at approximately 1240 cm–1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of CH2.10 The spectra of collagens modified with PAA-NHS
esters were similar to that of native collagen. However, blue shifts
of the amide I band of modified collagens could be detected (from
1652 to 1692 cm–1 for Col-PAA(2/1)), and the position
at 3400 cm–1 red-shifted to a lower frequency (3300
cm–1 for Col-PAA(2/1)). The changes on the bands
could be ascribed to the enhanced hydrogen bond interaction among
PAA-NHS-modified collagen molecules.30 Furthermore,
the intensity ratio of amide III/1450 cm–1, which
was regarded as an index to evaluate the structural integrity of collagen,31 was in the range of 0.85–0.90 for the
native collagen and the collagens modified with PAA-NHS esters, indicating
that the triple helix structure of modified collagens was not altered
significantly as gelatin, which was the denatured collagen product,
possessed a quite lower ratio of ∼0.6.32 Therefore, the FTIR results indicated that the PAA-NHS ester just
played a role as a harmless modifier of collagen without damaging
the structural integrity.

modified with PAA-NHS(2/1); schematic illustrating the permeation
of the native collagen and the modified collagen molecules through
the micropores of electrophoresis gel (c).

The SDS-PAGE patterns of the collagens are shown in the Figure 2b. As we know, the
native type I collagen monomer comprises two identical α1(I)
as well as one α2 (I) chains, and each chain in this heterotrimer
has a MW of ∼95 kDa.33 Just similar
to previous reports,9,34 the traits of all collagens displayed
the typical electrophoretic characteristic of type I collagen. In
addition, there was no extra band with lower molecular weight on the
gels, indicating that modified collagens retained the intact triple
helix structure. Nevertheless, a weaker color of the bands for modified
samples compared with those of the native collagen could be observed,
which could be attributed to the increased MW of modified collagens,
hindering the osmosis of collagen molecules when getting through the
micropore of the polyacrylamide gel,35 as
illustrated in Figure 2c. A comparison of the relative migration rate of the β component
(higher-molecular-weight component consists of two α chains),
as well as the relative band intensity between β component and
α chains are presented in Table 1, from which a clear trend indicating greater migration
rate of β, as well as the increase of β/α intensity
ratios could be observed upon increasing the esterification degrees
of PAA-NHS esters, testified the increase of the MW of collagen due
to the modification.

Influence of
PAA-NHS Esters on the Water Solubility of Collagens
For proteins,
the pI is an important parameter, reflecting the
relative proportion of acid/basic amino residues.10 When the ampholyte does not migrate in an electric field
(the zeta potential is zero), the pH of the solution or suspension
is the pI of the ampholyte.36 It is well
known that collagen could not be dissolved in aqueous solutions with
a pH value close to its pI.37Figure 3a shows the zeta
potential curves of all collagens. Under the same pH, the electric
potential was lower upon increasing the esterification degree of PAA-NHS
esters. According to the curves, the pI value of the native collagen
was 7.1 ±0.2, which was similar to the previous result.38 Whereas, upon increasing the esterification
degree, the pI values of the modified collagens decreased remarkably
to 4.3 ± 0.2, 3.8 ± 0.2, 3.2 ± 0.1, and 3.1 ±
0.1, which indicated that a significantly improved water solubility
was endowed by the modification on collagen with PAA-NHS esters. As
shown in Figure 3b,
the native collagen could be dissolved in acetic acidic solution and
could not be dissolved in neutral phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
solution; nevertheless, the modified collagens had a dissolving capacity
in contrast to that of native collagen in acetic acidic solution and
neutral PBS solution. This result was well consistent with the analysis
of pI measurements. Figure 3c illustrated the mechanism on the improved water solubility
of modified collagen. In the case of the native collagen, nearly equal
ionization occurred for both of the acid/basic amino groups at neutral
pH; thus the compactly assembled collagen molecules could not be separated
by water molecules. The reaction between ester groups of PAA-NHS esters
and the amino groups of collagen directly resulted in the consumption
of free amino groups. Furthermore, a lot of free carboxyl groups of
PAA-NHS esters were introduced to the modified collagen molecules.
When in neutral solution, the modified collagen molecules could be
readily separated by the strong electrostatic repulsion between ionized
carboxyl groups, leading to the desired dissolution capacity of collagen.
On the contrary, the modified collagen molecules could not be segregated
in acetic acidic solution because it was difficult for ionization
of the carboxyl group at acidic pH.

collagens modified with PAA-NHS
esters (a); digital photos for the solubility of the native collagen
and modified collagen in PBS (pH = 7.0) and acetic acid solution (pH
= 2.8), respectively (b); schematic illustrating the insolubility
and solubility of the native collagen and the modified collagen in
neutral aqueous solution (c).

Thermal Stability of Collagens
The DSC thermograms
of collagens are shown in Figure 4a. During temperature programming, the triple helix
structure of collagen molecules shifts into a disorganized form due
to the destruction of the interchain hydrogen bonding which stabilizes
the triplex of collagen.39,40 In the DSC method,
the endothermic peaks were associated with the above-mentioned transformation.
The denaturation temperature (Td) of collagens
modified with PAA-NHS esters increased by 4.8–5.9 °C compared
with that of native collagen (42.3 ± 0.1 °C). Moreover,
the Td of modified collagen increased
upon increasing the esterification degree of PAA-NHS esters, which
was related to more crosslinking points between collagen and PAA.
It should be pointed out that the pre-existing traditional water-soluble
collagen prepared with succinic anhydride as the modifier possessed Td a few degrees lower than that of the native
collagen.41 The changes in Td of collagen solutions modified with various chemicals
are shown in Table 2. It could be detected that collagen modified with PAA-NHS possessed
denaturation temperature not only higher than those of traditional
modifiers such as succinic anhydride and glutaraldehyde listed in
this table but also superior to that modified by adipic acid-NHS,
which was an NHS-activated small molecule modifier of collagen previously
reported.42 As indicated in Figure 4b, the superior thermal stability
of collagen modified with PAA-NHS was attributed to the stable chemical
cross-linking among modified collagen molecules, which formed the
stable amide bonds between the activated ester groups of PAA-NHS and
amino groups of collagen, plus the hydrogen-bond interaction between
the non-ionized carboxyl groups of PAA and the hydroxyl, amino, and
carboxyl groups of collagen macromolecules. The improved thermal stability
was quite beneficial to the process and application of this water-soluble
collagen. For example, it was favorable for the usage of the cosmetics
containing collagen in summer.

Micro–Nano Structure
and Aggregation Morphology of Collagens
Figure 5 displays
the visualized morphologies of the lyophilized collagens observed
via FESEM. All of the sponges possessed numerous pores, which reflected
a superior permeability. The porous morphology could be ascribed to
the sublimation of the ice crystal in the frozen hydrogels during
the lyophilization process. As shown in Figure 5a, walls around the pores were observed to
be the dominant sector of the sponges for native collagen. In addition,
it seemed that the native collagen exhibited a relatively homogeneous
morphology, which was due to the isotropous aggregation of collagen
molecules. As for modified collagens (Figure 5b–e), however, all of them showed
hierarchical pores, which was believed to be helpful for cell proliferation
when used as scaffolds.43 In addition,
the sponges consisted of abundant fibrils and sheets with different
sizes but not walls. These morphologies suggested the polydispersity
of the aggregates of the modified collagens in solution. The differences
in the microstructure could be observed more clearly in the enlarged
images (the insert of Figure 5a,d). As a control, the neat PAA (Figure 5f) and PAA-NHS ester (Figure 5g) displayed a homogeneous three-dimensional
morphology, suggesting their uniform aggregation state in solution.
Therefore, it seemed that the hierarchical morphology of the modified
collagen was in relevance of the interactions between collagen and
the PAA-NHS ester.

AFM possessed some advantages in exploring the microscopic aggregation
state of the biomacromolecule, as very dilute solutions could be applied
during sample preparation. Here, 20 μg/mL of the sample solution
was added dropwise to the mica prior to air drying, and then collagen
macromolecules assembled each other to form aggregates which could
be observed using AFM. The AFM images of native collagen and collagen
modified with PAA-NHS(2/1) are shown in the Figure 6. The AFM images of the native collagen (Figure 6a1) exhibited a homogeneous
fibrillar structure with a lot of microfibrils overlapped each other,
in accordance with the previous results.44,45 Nevertheless, the modified collagen sample (Figure 6b1) displayed a microscopic morphology distinct
from that of the native one; that is, each radial sheet with lager
size (a few hundreds of nanometers) was interconnected by several
nanofibrils to form a heterogeneous network. A similar morphology
could be observed from sample solutions with a higher collagen concentration
(400 μg/mL), although it seemed that the aggregates possessed
a larger size (Figure 6a2, b2). The results from AFM further verified the speculation that
the uniform and isotropous aggregation could be formed among the native
collagen molecules in acidic solution as expected (Figure 6a3), while the aggregation
behavior of the modified collagens was deeply influenced by the introduction
of a PAA backbone and the newly generated cross-linking (Figure 6b3). In brief, most
of the modified collagens could assemble to form sheets with size
larger than that of the native collagen due to both of the high molecular
weight (100 times that of collagen) of PAA and the covalent bond formation
between PAA-NHS and collagen. The sheets were interlinked with each
other by nanofibrils (the aggregates in a quite small size) to generate
the “fishing net-like” nanostructure.

Conclusions
In summary, we reported the facile fabrication
of water-soluble
collagen using an NHS-esterified derivative of high molecular weight
PAA (PAA-NHS ester) as a novel bifunctional modifier. Such modified
collagen designs provided unique advantages compared with the established
strategies such as succinylation modification, including intact secondary
structures, facile water solubility in water at neutral pH, improved
thermostability, and the hierarchical microstructures/“fishing
net-like” nanostructure simultaneously. Note that PAA possessed
an ultra-high molecular weight (100 times that of collagen), a plenty
of negative charge could be introduced when PAA was linked with collagen
via the amide bond formation between the amino groups of collagen
and the ester groups of PAA-NHS esters. We believed that this work
could stimulate new opportunities in the facile preparation of polyanions
but not limited to the water-soluble collagen, using the PAA-NHS ester
as a novel modifier for a wide range of applications.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Collagen was extracted from calf hide referring
to the previous method.46 Calf split was
swollen in 0.5 mol/L acetic acid (HAc) and then treated with pepsin
(0.3%, w/w) for 72 h. After enzyme treatment, calf pieces were centrifuged
and salted by sodium chloride (NaCl). Afterward, crude collagen was
dissolved and dialyzed against 0.1 mol/L HAc for 72 h. Finally, the
depurated collagen sponge was obtained via lyophilization and stored
until use. PAA sodium salt (PAA-Na) with MW of ∼30,000 kDa
was provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Protein
marker (6.6–200 kDa), NHS, EDC, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
ethanol, and n-hexane were purchased from Aladdin
Co., Ltd. (China). Deionized water was used for all the experiments.

Synthesis of PAA-NHS Esters
First, PAA was prepared
through the dialysis of PAA-Na in HCl solution (1 × 10–4 mol/L). Then, the pretreated PAA was placed into DMSO and was allowed
to stand in the solution for 24 h with stirring. After PAA was dissolved,
NHS and EDC were added (the molar ratios of NHS/COOH were 1/5, 1/2,
1/1, and 2/1; the constant molar ratio of EDC/COOH was 1/1). When
reaction finished, the mixed solution was precipitated with ethanol
and n-hexane for three times. Ultimately, the products
were dried at vacuum and stored at room temperature until use. The
activated esters were denoted as PAA-NHS(1/5), PAA-NHS(1/2), PAA-NHS(1/1),
and PAA-NHS(2/1), respectively.

Characterization of PAA-NHS
Esters
PAA or PAA-NHS esters
were prepared as pellets via tableting with potassium bromide (KBr).
The FTIR spectra were recorded with a Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument
(Nicolet IS10, USA). All spectra were obtained at the resolution of
4 cm–1 in the wavenumber region of 4000–400
cm–1, and each spectra pot represented the average
of 64 scans.

1H NMR spectra were further applied
to determine the esterification degree of PAA-NHS esters. First, samples
were put into a 2 mL reaction tube. After the addition of deuterated
D2O or deuterated DMSO, these tubes vibrated and were capped.
The tube was analyzed by a Bruck instrument (ADVANCE III 500, Germany)
under 500 MHz. The esterification extent was calculated based on the
relative peaks area, corresponding to the protons of NHS and those
binding to the carbon atom of PAA, respectively.

Modification
of Collagen with PAA-NHS Esters
First,
the lyophilized collagen was dissolved into 1 × 10–3 mol/L HCl solution to 5 mg/mL, followed by adjusting the pH to 9
with 1 mol/L NaOH. Then, PAA-NHS esters were dissolved in DMSO to
gain a concentration of 50 mg/mL, which was added dropwise into collagen
solution with stirring subsequently (the mass ratio of PAA-NHS ester
to collagen was 1/2). The pH value of collagen solution was maintained
at 9 with the supplement of 1 mol/L NaOH during the reaction. After
24 h, the rough-wrought modified collagen was dialyzed against deionized
(DI) water for 72 h. Finally, the modified collagens were freeze-dried
and stored until use. For short, collagens modified with PAA-NHS(1/5),
PAA-NHS(1/2), PAA-NHS(1/1), and PAA-NHS(2/1) were named Col-PAA(1/5),
Col-PAA(1/2), Col-PAA(1/1) and Col-PAA(2/1), respectively.

FTIR Analysis
of Collagen
The FTIR spectra of collagens
were recorded according to the method similar to the section “Characterization of PAA-NHS Esters”.

SDS-PAGE Pattern
The SDS-PAGE patterns of collagens
were analyzed according to the method of Lamemmli.47 First, collagens were mixed with the sample buffer and
boiled for 10 min and then were loaded on 2.5% stacking gel and 7.5%
running gel in a vertical slab. At a constant current of 12 mA, SDS-PAGE
was performed and subjected to electrophoresis, running on a Mini
Protein II unit. When the indicatrix reached the bottom, the gel was
dyed with coomassie brilliant blue for 45 min and faded with methanol/HAc.
A protein marker with the MW in the range of 6.6–200 kDa was
used as the standard. Gel images were analyzed with ImageJ 1.42 software
(developed by Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, U.S.A.).

pI Measurements
Collagen sponges of the native and
modified collagens were dissolved in DI water or dilute HCl solution
to reach a final concentration of 1 mg/mL, and then the zeta potential
values were recorded by a Malvern Zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer
Nano ZS90, UK). After the collagen solution was transferred to a capillary
cell, the pH value was adjusted using 0.1 mol/L HCl or 0.1 mol/L NaOH.
The zeta potential of each solution was measured in quintuplicates.

DSC Measurements
The thermostability of collagens was
evaluated by DSC (Netzsch DSC 200PC, Germany). The native and modified
collagens with a concentration of 10 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving
lyophilized samples in 0.1 mol/L HAc and 0.2 mol/L PBS, respectively.
The collagen solutions were weighted and put into aluminium pans with
covers, followed by scanning from 36 to 52 °C with the heating
rate of 2 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Pan with 0.1 mol/L
HAc or 0.2 mol/L PBS (pH 7.0) was used as the reference. The denaturation
temperature (Td) values were the mean
value from three replicates.

FESEM Observations
The morphology
of collagens was
observed with a Navo FEI field-emission electron microscope (NanoSEM
230, USA). Lyophilized collagen sponges were mounted on stubs, sputter-coated
with gold and then observed at various magnifications. The morphology
was collected at five different points for each sample.

AFM Observations
AFM was used to reveal the microstructure
change of collagen fibrils in the presence of PAA. First, the native
collagen and modified collagens were dissolved in 0.1 mol/L acetic
acid or 0.2 mol/L PBS (pH 7.0) to 20 or 400 μg/mL. After dissolution
completely, 20 μL of collagen solution was added dropwise onto
a fresh mica and dried for 12 h at room temperature. Afterward, the
mica slice was applied on a Bruker AFM (Multimode 8, Germany) for
observations.
