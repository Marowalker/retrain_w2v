The development of practical and
robust detection methods for pesticides
is an important research objective owing to the known toxicity, carcinogenicity,
and environmental persistence of these compounds. Pesticides have
been found in bodies of water that are located near areas where pesticides
are commonly used and easily spread to beaches, lakes, and rivers;
affect the species living in those waterways; and harm humans who
come into contact with or eat fish from such water. Reported herein
is the rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of four organochlorine
pesticides in a variety of water sources across the state of Rhode
Island using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence detection. This method
relies on the ability of cyclodextrin to promote analyte-specific
fluorescence modulation of a high quantum yield fluorophore when a
pesticide is in close proximity, combined with subsequent array-based
statistical analyses of the measurable changes in the emission signals.
This system operates with high sensitivity (low micromolar detection
limits), selectivity (100% differentiation between structurally similar
analytes), and general applicability (for different water samples
with varying salinity and pH as well as for different water temperatures).

==== Body
Introduction
Pesticides are a ubiquitous
class of organic pollutants known for
their environmental persistence;1−3 carcinogenicity;4,5 and toxicity to humans,6 animals,7 and plants.8 These
compounds are used widely by farmers worldwide to control insects,
fungi, and other pests9,10 and to maximize crop yields and
food production.11,12 Once released into the environment,
pesticides spread widely, persisting in water,13 air,14 soil,15 and sediment.16 Most of these
pesticides are resistant to hydrolysis and degrade slowly under standard
environmental conditions;17−19 as a result, pesticides both
bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain20 and have exacerbated negative effects to humans and animals.21,22

The ability to detect pesticides is an important research
objective
with significant applications in the food and agricultural industries,23,24 public health policies,25,26 and a variety of other
scientific subdisciplines.27 Currently
used methods for such detection rely heavily on mass spectrometry-based
techniques,28−30 which are time-consuming, expensive, and often require
additional preparation procedures prior to analysis. Newer detection
methods using techniques such as Raman spectroscopy31,32 or electrochemical assays33 have recently
been developed and demonstrated extremely high sensitivity; however,
each of these techniques also requires significant time and resources,
which can limit the ability to conduct high-throughput assays of large
populations to monitor widespread pesticide exposure.

Previous
work in our laboratory has focused on the use of cyclodextrin-promoted
fluorescence energy transfer for the rapid, sensitive, and selective
detection of aromatic toxicants.34−37 This system relies on the ability
of cyclodextrin to promote proximity-induced energy transfer from
an aromatic toxicant energy donor to a high quantum yield fluorophore
acceptor, leading to a bright, turn-on fluorescence signal that is
unique to each cyclodextrin–analyte–fluorophore combination.
We have shown that such detection operates successfully in purified
buffer solutions,38 human urine,39 and human breast milk;40 that it can form a part of oil spill remediation procedures using
the cyclodextrin-promoted toxicant extraction followed by fluorescence
detection;41−44 and that it can be used for the detection of both polar and nonpolar
photophysically active toxicants.45

In cases where the target analyte is not photophysically active
and cannot participate in energy transfer, highly analyte-specific
fluorescence modulation can still occur, in which the cyclodextrin
promotes proximity-induced changes in the fluorophore emission signal
when the target analyte is in close proximity. This fluorescence modulation-based
system has been used successfully in the detection of fuel components
including benzene and alkylated benzene derivatives in contaminated
water samples,46 as well as in the detection
of nonaromatic alcohols47 and organochlorine
pesticides48 in purified buffer systems.

One environment that is particularly important is water because
toxicants found in aqueous environments will affect people who drink
the water, organisms that live in water (i.e., seafood), and people
who consume such organisms. Although our previously reported cyclodextrin-based
systems provided accurate pesticide detection in purified buffer systems,
there are substantial differences between such purified buffer solutions
and real-world aqueous environments that complicate the development
and optimization of toxicant detection methods. In particular, real-world
aqueous environments contain a plethora of living species (both plant
and animal), can have high salinity (in saltwater systems) and a broad
variety of pHs, and can be found at a variety of temperatures (depending
on geographic location and season).

Reported herein is the rapid,
sensitive, and selective detection
of four organochlorine pesticides in water sources across the state
of Rhode Island using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence modulation.
We demonstrate that this system operates with high sensitivity (low
micromolar detection limits), selectivity (100% differentiation between
compounds), and general applicability (for different water samples
with varying salinity and pH as well as for different temperatures
of these water samples).

Experimental Section
All organochlorine
pesticides and control analytes (compounds 1–5, Figure 1) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich chemical company and used
as received, unless otherwise noted. Fluorophore 6 was
synthesized following literature-reported procedures.491H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker
300 MHz spectrometer. UV–visible spectra were recorded using
a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectra were
recorded using a Shimadzu RF-5301PC spectrophotofluorimeter. The following
commercially available cyclodextrin derivatives were used as received:
α-cyclodextrin, β-cyclodextrin, randomly methylated β-cyclodextrin,50 2-hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin, and γ-cyclodextrin.
For the temperature-dependent studies, a Fisher Scientific Isotemp
6200 R20 instrument was used to control the temperature, and the spectrophotometer
was equipped with a single constant-temperature cell holder. All gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) measurements
were obtained using a Shimadzu GC–MS-QP2020 gas chromatograph–mass
spectrometer. Conductivity measurements were obtained using a Thermo
Scientific Orion 3-Star Benchtop Conductivity Kit. All pH experiments
were performed using a MicroLab FS-522 instrument.

Sample Collection Procedures
Water samples were collected
from four locations around Rhode Island (Figure 2): Arcadia Lake, Narragansett Bay, Atlantic
Ocean, and Providence
River. Samples were collected directly from the water using amber
high-density polyethylene bottles obtained from Fisher Scientific,
were transported to the University of Rhode Island in a climate-controlled
vehicle within 1 h of collection, and were stored in the laboratory
refrigerator until used for the analysis.

sites. The red marker indicates Arcadia
Lake, the green marker shows Narragansett Bay, the blue marker shows

The map has been digitally manipulated so that only the state of Rhode
Island is in focus.

General Procedure for Fluorescence
Modulation Experiments
In a quartz cuvette, 1.25 mL of a
10 mM cyclodextrin solution dissolved
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1.25 mL of the water sample
were combined. A fluorophore 6 solution [100 μL,
0.1 mg/mL in tetrahydrofuran (THF)] was added, and the solution was
excited at 460 nm. Analytes 1–4 (20 μL,
1.0 mg/mL solution in THF) or control analyte 5 were
added to the mixture, and the resulting solution was excited at 460
nm. The fluorescence emission spectra were integrated versus the wavenumber
on the X-axis, and the fluorescence modulation was
measured by the ratio of integrated emission in the presence of the
analyte to integrated emission of the fluorophore in the absence of
the analyte, as shown in eq 1 1  where Flanalyte is the integrated
fluorescence emission of the fluorophore in the presence of the analyte
and Flblank is the integrated fluorescence emission of
the fluorophore in the absence of the analyte. All fluorescence experiments
were performed at room temperature (∼22 °C).

Temperature-Dependent
Fluorescence Modulation Experiments
A solution of cyclodextrin
(10 mM) was prepared in PBS. Fluorescence
modulation experiments were conducted at 5 and 30 °C, as the
vast majority of ocean water temperatures fall into this range.51,52 Fluorescence experiments were repeated for each water–cyclodextrin–analyte
combination. The temperature control system indicated when the desired
temperature was reached, and each sample was allowed to equilibrate
for approximately 10 min at the final temperature before the fluorescence
emission spectrum was collected.

General Procedure for Limit
of Detection Calculations53
The
limit of detection (LOD) is defined
as the lowest concentration of the analyte at which a signal can be
detected. To determine this value, the following steps were performed
for each water–cyclodextrin–analyte combination. In
a quartz cuvette, 1.25 mL of 10 mM cyclodextrin in PBS and 1.25 mL
of water sample were combined. Then, 100 μL of a 0.1 mg/mL solution
of fluorophore 6 was added, the solution was excited
at the excitation wavelength of fluorophore 6, and the
fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. Six repeat measurements
were taken.

Next, 5 μL of the analyte (1 mg/mL in THF)
was doped into an aqueous sample, and again the solution was excited
at the fluorophore’s excitation wavelength, and the fluorescence
emission spectra were recorded. Six repeat measurements were taken.
This step was repeated for 10 μL of the analyte, 15 μL
of the analyte, 20 μL of the analyte, 25 μL of the analyte,
30 μL of the analyte, 35 μL of the analyte, and 40 μL
of the analyte, all of which were doped into an aqueous sample that
did not initially contain toxicants to measure the ability of the
system to detect the doped toxicants within the complex aqueous matrix.

All of the fluorescence emission spectra were integrated versus
wavenumber
on the X-axis, and calibration curves
were generated. The curves were plotted with the analyte concentration
in micromolar on the X-axis and the fluorescence
modulation ratio on the Y-axis. The curve was fitted
to a straight line, and the equation of the line was determined (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Example of a calibration
curve used to calculate LOD.

The LOD is defined according to eq 2 2  where SDblank is the standard deviation
of the blank sample and m is the slope of the calibration
curve. In cases where the slope of the trend line was negative, the
absolute value of the slope was used to calculate the LOD. In all
cases, the LOD was reported in micromolar.

General Procedure for Array
Generation Experiments
Array analysis was performed using
SYSTAT 13 statistical computing
software with the following settings:(a) Classical discriminant analysis.

(b) Grouping variable: analytes.

(c) Predictors: α-cyclodextrin/BODIPY,
β-cyclodextrin/BODIPY, methyl-β-cyclodextrin/BODIPY, 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin/BODIPY,

(d) Long-range statistics: Mahal.



General Procedures for Water Characterization Experiments
GC–MS
Experiments
The water sample (10 mL) and
2 g of sodium chloride were added to a separatory funnel. Then, 20
mL of dichloromethane was added to the separatory funnel, and the
separatory funnel was shaken vigorously. The aqueous layer was discarded,
and another 10 mL of water was added to the organic layer. The remaining
organic layer was set to evaporate to 1 mL under a stream of nitrogen,
filtered, and analyzed by GC–MS.

All GC–MS measurements
were obtained on a Shimadzu-QP2020 gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer
with the following settings:

Column: Shimadzu SH-Rxi-5Sil MS
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm).

Oven temperature:
45 °C, hold for 7 min, ramp to 200 °C
at 20 °C/min, hold for 60 min.

Injection temperature: 200
°C.

Splitting ratio: splitless.

MS ion source temperature:
230 °C.

Interface temperature: 150 °C.

Total
run time: 60 min.

pH Experiments
All pH experiments
were performed using
a MicroLab FS-522 instrument equipped with a pH probe. The probe was
calibrated using Fisherbrand pH 4, 7, and 10 premade buffer solutions.
Data were obtained using MicroLab software version 6.3.4.

Conductivity
Experiments
All conductivity experiments
were performed using a Thermo Scientific Orion 3-Star Benchtop Conductivity
Kit. The conductivity probe was rinsed with deionized water between
samples.

Results and Discussion
Water Characterization
Experiments
GC–MS Experiments
Quantifiable
differences between
locations used for water sampling were determined via GC–MS
analysis. All water samples tested showed peaks that corresponded
to long-chain alkanes,54 fatty acids,55 and amides56 which
are commonly found in marine environments (Figure 4). Notably, Arcadia Lake showed the highest
number of peaks, indicating the largest number of organic compounds,
and greatest intensity of peaks, indicating the highest concentrations
of each of those compounds. The higher prevalence of organic compounds
in Arcadia Lake compared to the other water bodies investigated is
likely due to the lack of natural cycling in lake water57 compared to the river, ocean, and bay water
and the limited options for content regeneration in that lake.58 Notably, samples from Arcadia Lake also contained
GC–MS peaks that corresponded to phthalates, commonly found
in plastics59 and other commercial products,60 and benzophenone,61 commonly used in personal care products such as sunscreen62 and lip balm.63

Arcadia Lake; the pink line represents Narragansett Bay; the blue
line represents Atlantic Ocean; and the brown line represents Providence
River.

pH and Conductivity Experiments
Differences between
the four water sampling locations were further quantified through
pH and conductivity analysis. The pH of water bodies can vary significantly,
often becoming more acidic in locations where acid rain is prevalent64 and basic in cases where there are algal blooms65 or other ecosystem-wide phenomena.66 The most acidic water of the four samples was
the Atlantic Ocean, with a measured pH of 6.51. The most basic water
body was Arcadia Lake, with a pH of 8.28, likely due to algal growth
that is known to be highly prevalent in lake environments. The conductivity
of each sample was measured and used as an indicator of salinity and
electrolyte concentration, in accordance with the literature precedent.67,68 Unsurprisingly, the Atlantic Ocean sample had the highest conductivity,
corresponding to the highest salt content, closely followed by the
Narragansett Bay (also a saltwater location) and the Providence River.
Arcadia Lake, a freshwater body, showed a markedly lower conductivity
value (lowest salinity), as expected.

Fluorescence Modulation
Undoped
Water Samples
In addition to measuring innate
differences in water samples using GC–MS, pH, and conductivity
analyses, we investigated the ability of fluorophore 6 in combination with varying cyclodextrins to report on differing
environments and solution compositions. To that end, analyte-free
(termed “undoped”) water samples were mixed with fluorophore 6 and cyclodextrins, and the fluorescence emission signals
of fluorophore 6 for each sample–cyclodextrin
combination were subjected to linear discriminant analysis (LDA).
The results indicate 100% success in differentiating between water
samples (Figure 5),
which is a result of the sensitivity of fluorophore 6–cyclodextrin combinations to differences in salinity, pH,
and other sample-specific compositional variations.

of fluorophore 6 in water samples.

Analyte-Doped Water Samples
After determining that
different aqueous environments translate into different fluorescence
emission responses in undoped solutions, we then evaluated the ability
of fluorophore 6–cyclodextrin combinations to
detect the presence of toxicants that had been doped into water, using
our previously developed cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence modulation.
For each water–cyclodextrin–fluorophore 6 combination, we added small amounts of an aliphatic pesticide (compounds 1–4) as a solution in THF. We also evaluated the effect
of THF itself without additional pesticide present, as control analyte 5. The degree of modulated fluorescence emission that occurred
with the introduction of analytes 1–4 or control
analyte 5 was quantified according to eq 1. In most cases, the fluorescence
modulation values were greater than 1, indicating that introduction
of the analytes led to an increase in the fluorescence emission of
fluorophore 6 (Table 1).

of the results from four trials for each sample. Fluorescence modulation
values were calculated using eq 1. Errors are shown with enough significant figures to accurately
capture the errors.

The
different cyclodextrins caused different degrees of changes
in the fluorescence emission of fluorophore 6, which
highlights the role of cyclodextrin as a highly specific supramolecular
scaffold. Notably, the degree of fluorescence modulation for the observed
analytes in the presence of α-cyclodextrin is similar to those
observed in the absence of any supramolecular host (PBS), which is
likely due to the fact that α-cyclodextrin is known to have
a low affinity for the majority of organic analytes because of its
highly sterically constrained cavity.69,70 Selected results
from Table 1 are highlighted
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Fluorescence
changes of fluorophore 6 upon the introduction
of (A) analyte 1, (B) analyte 2, (C) analyte 3, (D) analyte 4, and (E) control analyte 5 in the Atlantic Ocean (λex = 460 nm).

In addition to comparing fluorophore
ratios in the presence and
absence of analytes, as shown in Table 1, we can also compare the fluorescence emission intensities
across different cyclodextrin hosts. As shown in Figure 5, the greatest emission intensity
for fluorophore 6 was obtained in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin.
The high fluorescence intensity associated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin
is well-known from our previous research43−45 and is likely
a result of the high binding affinity of methyl-β-cyclodextrin
to fluorophore 6 and related aromatic organic analytes.71−73

Interestingly, the sampling location had an effect on the
emission
signals as well. The effect of sampling location on analytes 1 and 2 in the presence and absence of cyclodextrin
can be seen in Figure 7. The differences between sampling locations are more pronounced
and more noticeable with the methyl-β-cyclodextrin host, which
highlights the advantages in using a host that promotes strong fluorescence
emission signals. Differences observed between water sample locations
are quantified in Table 2.

sampling locations in the presence of (A) analyte 1 and
Me-β-CD, (B) analyte 1 and PBS, (C) analyte 2 and Me-β-CD, and (D) analyte 2 and PBS.

Practical Considerations
The ability
to use this cyclodextrin-promoted
fluorescence modulation system for the development of practical detection
devices requires (a) selectivity in differentiating between
structurally similar analytes, (b) sensitivity for low
concentrations of pesticides, and (c) general applicability for different water samples with varying salinity and pH, as well
as for different temperatures of these water samples.

Selectivity
The selectivity of this system was determined
using an array-based analysis to distinguish between structurally
similar analytes. Statistical analysis of the response patterns generated
from fluorescence-based detection of analytes 1–5 in the presence of several cyclodextrin hosts in each sampling location
resulted in 100% differentiation between analytes (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Array-based detection
of analytes 1–5 in (A)
Arcadia Lake; (B) Narragansett Bay; (C) Atlantic Ocean; and (D) Providence
River.

The response patterns are markedly
distinct for each water sample
and show unique, well-separated signals for structurally similar organochlorine
pesticides within each water sample. The high degree of success and
noticeable visual differences between sampling locations highlight
the power of this statistical method in distinguishing even very slight
structural variations (i.e., analytes 1 and 2) and in differentiating between sampling locations. Moreover, the
results indicate that the fluorescence modulation as a basis for toxicant
detection operates with high selectivity in complex marine environments,
regardless of the salt content (highest in the Atlantic Ocean), pH
(varied between 6.51 and 8.28), or innate toxicant contamination levels
(highest in Arcadia Lake).

Additionally, the array-based analysis
was also performed on a
sample from Arcadia Lake to see if this method could differentiate
between two structurally near stereoisomeric compounds, cis-chlordane (analyte 1) and trans-chlordane
(Figure 9).

Figure 9 Array-based
detection of analytes 1–5 and trans-chlordane Arcadia Lake.

The response patterns show well-separated signals for cis-chlordane and trans-chlordane, even
in an area
of high innate toxicant contamination levels as in Arcadia Lake. This
highlights the power of this method to distinguish between cis and trans isomers, which is a difficult
task even for highly specialized and costly instrumentation.

Sensitivity
The sensitivity of this system was determined
by calculating LODs for all water–methyl-β-cyclodextrin–analyte
combinations following literature-reported procedures, and the results
of these studies are summarized in Table 3.

Table 3 LODs for Analytes 1–4 in Water Samplesa
analyte	sampling location	LOD (ppm)	
1	Arcadia Lake	1.71 ± 0.02	
 	Narragansett Bay	0.50 ± 0.002	
 	Atlantic Ocean	0.41 ± 0.001	
 	Providence River	2.67 ± 0.01	
2	Arcadia Lake	4.25 ± 0.08	
 	Narragansett Bay	0.81 ± 0.01	
 	Atlantic Ocean	0.21 ± 0.001	
 	Providence River	0.55 ± 0.002

 	Narragansett Bay	0.50 ± 0.001	
 	Atlantic Ocean	0.28 ± 0.002	
 	Providence River	0.63 ± 0.002	
4	Arcadia Lake	2.19 ± 0.02	
 	Narragansett Bay	5.56 ± 0.03	
 	Atlantic Ocean	1.07 ± 0.01	
 	Providence River	1.94 ± 0.004	
a LODs were calculated using the procedures
in Cheng 2016; see the Supporting Information for more information. Errors are shown with enough significant figures
to accurately capture the errors.

These detection limits are near or below the 0.5 ppm
literature-reported
levels of concern in many cases.74−76 In general, the LODs
for analytes in Arcadia Lake were slightly higher than those measured
in the other aqueous environments. This is likely due to the higher
innate levels of toxicants found in this lake that can interfere with
favorable intermolecular interactions and are slightly lower than
the system sensitivity under those conditions. Current efforts in
our laboratory are focused on lowering the detection limits for cases
where the detection limits are above the literature-reported levels
of concern using other fluorophores and/or cyclodextrin hosts. We
are also exploring the use of a preconcentration step in conjunction
with this system to achieve higher effective concentrations of the
toxicant analytes.77−79

General Applicability
The general
applicability of
this system was determined using cyclodextrin-promoted fluorescence
modulation and subsequent array-based analyses at varying temperatures,
focused particularly on seasonal temperature variations of the Rhode
Island water to include extreme winter temperatures (5 °C) and
extreme summer temperatures (30 °C). Detection at these temperatures
resulted in 100% success in differentiating and identifying the pesticide
analytes, which highlights the ability of this detection system to
operate at a broad variety of temperatures, including most measured
ocean temperatures (Figure 10).80,81 This selectivity was applied
even in real-world complicated environments, which contained some
amount of innate organic matter, as measured by GC–MS (vide
supra) and supported by the literature precedent.82

Figure 10 Array-based detection of analytes 1–5 in Arcadia
Lake at (A) 5 and (B) 30 °C.

Additionally, the general applicability was also highlighted
by
comparing the fluorescence response signals of a single-target analyte
in four different water samples, all of which have differences in
their chemical compositions (see GC–MS
Experiments section above). For these experiments, we selected
analyte 1, and the integrated fluorescence responses
from fluorophore 6 in the presence of analyte 1 in four different water samples yielded four unique response signals
(Figure 11). Statistical
analysis of these results provided 100% success in identifying the
water sampling location in which the analyte was found. The well-separated,
distinct signals for each water sample highlight the potential for
profiling sampling locations based on such identification and creating
water sampling location-specific patterns for accurate identification
purposes.

Conclusions
In summary, cyclodextrin-promoted
fluorescence modulation can be
used for the detection of organochlorine pesticides in contaminated
marine environments. This method is selective (100% successful in
differentiating structurally similar analytes such as cis-chlordane and trans-chlordane), sensitive (sub-ppm
detection limits, with slightly higher limits observed in Arcadia
Lake for some analytes), and generally applicable (for different water
samples with varying salinity, including freshwater and saltwater,
and pH as well as for different temperatures of these water samples
including most measured temperatures of ocean water). The high selectivity,
sensitivity, and general applicability show the potential for the
development of practically applicable portable detection devices.
Future work in our laboratory will be dedicated toward lowering the
detection limits to achieve optimal sensitivity and further developing
this method into a portable detection device for the detection of
pesticides in contaminated marine environments.
