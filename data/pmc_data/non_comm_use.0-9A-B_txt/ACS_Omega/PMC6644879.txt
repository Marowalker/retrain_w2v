This work reports a novel sustainable
two-step method for the synthesis
of ethylene glycol (EG) using syngas. In the first step, diethyl oxalate
was selectively synthesized via oxidative double carbonylation of
ethanol and carbon monoxide (CO) using a ligand-free, recyclable Pd/C
catalyst. In the second step, the diethyl oxalate produced underwent
subsequent hydrogenation using [2-(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-6-(diethylaminomethyl)pyridine]ruthenium(II)
chlorocarbonyl hydride to get EG and ethanol. Thus, the generated
ethanol can be recycled back to the first step for double carbonylation.
This method gives a sustainable route to manufacture EG using carbon
monoxide and hydrogen.

Introduction
In the industrial technology
perspective, production of chemicals
based on C1 chemistry from abundant carbon sources such as coal, natural
gas, biomass, and various solid waste is an ideal alternative to the
petrochemical-based production due to its green nature.1−3 Increase in the global demand of bulk chemicals has compelled the
researchers to innovate various new and alternative strategies to
prepare these bulk chemicals. Ethylene glycol (EG) synthesized using
such easily available and cost-efficient chemical building blocks
can substitute the production of EG derived from traditional petroleum
sources.4−6 EG is a much important commodity chemical because
of its vast applications, such as antifreeze agents, solvents, in
manufacturing of heat transfer agents, and as a precursor for the
manufacture of polyester fiber, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
resin.2,7 Due to increase in population, the demand
of PET resin and polyester fibers has increased significantly, which
also leads to a constant growth of EG production.8,9 Currently,
hydrolysis of petroleum-based ethylene oxide derived from ethylene
is used for the commercial production of ethylene glycol (Scheme 1a).7,10,11 The major drawback associated
with the process is the use of harsh reaction conditions and of large
by-product generation. Although synthesis of EG from syngas under
reductive conditions is an ideal method, but low reactivity and selectivity
limit its applications. Syntheses of EG from methanol, formaldehyde,
and methyl formate are some alternate methods, but again, low reactivity
and selectivity limit their applications also.12−15 In the current scenario, carbonylation
chemistry is used in industry for producing many useful products.16 Palladium-catalyzed oxidative carbonylation
is of great interest, which applies different organic nucleophiles
or electrophiles in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) and oxidation
reagents to prepare various carbonyl-containing compounds.17,18

Scheme 1 Previous Approach for EG: (a) Traditional Methods, (b) Carbonylation
and Hydrogenation Method
Recently, Prof. Beller and his group have developed a
novel method
for the synthesis of EG by catalytic hydrogenation of oxamide using
Ru- and Fe-based catalysts for the first time (Scheme 1b).19 In our previous
work, we have published a similar two-step approach for EG synthesis
by oxidative cross double carbonylation of amines and alcohols followed
by catalytic hydrogenation of oxamates using a highly active ruthenium
PNN pincer catalyst prepared by Milstein and co-workers and used for
amide and ester hydrogenation.20,21 In our laboratory,
we have synthesized oxamates successfully by oxidative cross double
carbonylation of alcohols and amines using Pd/C as a heterogeneous
and recyclable catalyst.22 On the basis
of the previous results with oxamide and oxamate, we thought that
these processes can be further simplified using oxalates for such
an application.23,24 Traditionally, oxalates are prepared
by esterification of oxalic acid or oxalyl chloride. The disadvantage
of this method is the use of thermally unstable oxalyl chlorides.
Other alternatives like nitric oxide-mediated carbonylation of alcohols
to dialkyl oxalates, using palladium complexes, are preferred in industry
because of its higher reactivity.25 However,
the major limitation of using nitric oxide is that it is not environmentally
friendly due to its highly corrosive nature, and there is a requirement
of a specific quality of the material, which adds complication to
this process. Hence, this work is focused on the production of EG
selectively using the process from CO without the use/formation of
unstable reagents.

On the basis of the current progress in the
field of carbonylation
and hydrogenation reactions and to extend our interest in this area,
diethyl oxalate was used as a key intermediate for the synthesis of
EG via oxidative double carbonylation of ethanol using the Pd/C catalyst
under ligand-free conditions and subsequent hydrogenation to EG using
[2-(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-6-(diethylaminomethyl)pyridine]ruthenium(II)
chlorocarbonyl hydride (Milstein’s catalyst) (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Oxalate-Mediated
Approach to EG
Results and Discussion
In this work, diethyl oxalate was synthesized by oxidative double
carbonylation of ethanol, using Pd/C as a heterogeneous catalyst (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Oxidative Double
Carbonylation of Ethanol Using the Pd/C Catalyst
Preliminary studies were carried out using the
Pd/C catalyst (5
and 10% loading) for the double carbonylation reaction using ethanol
in the presence of CO/O2 (25:6 ratio), as shown in Table 1. The catalyst (10
mol %, 10% Pd/C) provides excellent yield of the desired product (Table 1, entry 4). The lower
yield of the oxalate was obtained due to low catalyst loading. Molecular
oxygen and the iodide additive along with the Pd/C catalyst play a
significant role in oxidative carbonylation reactions.26 In the presence of iodide promoters such as
sodium iodide, potassium iodide, and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI),
Pd/C was found to be an effective catalyst (Table 2, entries 1–3). The tetrabutylammonium
iodide was found to be an excellent promoter for the present carbonylation
reaction (Table 2,
entry 3). Results in the presence of TBAI might be due to the “soft”
binding nature of iodide and because it is electron-rich, polarizable,
and a good nucleophile compared with the other halides. For the effective
progress of the reaction, the iodide promoter is an essential requirement
without which the reaction never proceeds17b (Table 2, entry 4).
The plausible mechanism for double carbonylation in the presence of
the TBAI promoter is shown in Figure 1. Initially, the iodides get adsorbed on the Pd surface
and oxidative addition of the first molecule of ethanol takes place
to generate metal hydride species. This metal hydride species undergoes
double CO insertion. Finally, reductive elimination of diethyl oxalate
from the Pd surface takes place in the presence of the second molecule
of ethanol and oxygen. The iodides remain on the Pd surface as studied
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and continue the
catalytic cycle.

b GC yields.

In the Pd/C-catalyzed double carbonylation reaction, temperature
plays an important role for the reaction to proceed (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). It was observed
that at 70 °C the maximum yield of the desired product was obtained
and the diethyl oxalate was obtained with 90% yield in 8 h (Table 2, entry 3). No significant
effect on the yield of the product was observed by further increasing
the reaction temperature (Table 2, entry 6). Pressure was found to be critical in this
process. At 5 atm pressure, less yield of the oxalate was obtained,
whereas on further increasing the pressure up to 25 atm, the product
was obtained in 90% yield (Table 2, entries 3, 7, and 8). The reaction requires 8 h to
get maximum conversion of ethanol into diethyl oxalate (Table 2, entry 3). At 7 h reaction
time, the yield was reduced to 86% (Table 2, entry 9). Longer reaction time had no profound
effect on the yield and quality (Table 2, entry 10).

To make a process more economical,
the recyclability study of the
catalyst plays an important role. In this protocol, under optimized
reaction conditions, the recyclability of the Pd/C catalyst has been
studied. After four consecutive recycles, the Pd/C catalyst was found
to be effective without loss in performance activity (Scheme 4). No significant leaching
of the Pd metal was observed in the product mixture after completion
of first and fourth recycle runs. Pd was found below the detectable
limit (0.01 ppm) reveled by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy analysis. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis of fresh and recycled catalysts showed that the components
of Pd were uniformly distributed over the carbon surface, and no agglomeration
was seen. Structural changes of fresh, first, and fourth recycled
Pd/C catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD pattern
showed the diffracted peaks for the Pd/C catalyst, and no significant
structural change was found in fresh and recycled catalysts. The composition
of elements Pd, C, and O in the catalyst used in this double carbonylation
reaction is analyzed by XPS (Figure 2a). The spectra of element Pd at 336 and 341 eV represent
Pd2+ in the fresh Pd/C catalyst (Figure 2b). Shifting of Pd catalyst peaks to 334.4
and 339.6 eV after first and fourth recycles, which are assigned as
3d5/2 and 3d3/2 for Pd0 species,
indicates that the catalyst is reduced but the activity of Pd species
remains constant for the Pd reaction.

(a) wide scan;
(b) Pd 3d; (c) C 1s; (d) O 1s; and (e) I 3d.

Scheme 4 Recycle Study of Pd/C-Catalyzed Synthesis of Diethyl Oxalate
This suggests that double carbonylation
of ethanol was promoted
by the Pd(0) species present on the carbon support. One
would expect the activity of Pd to increase in the fourth cycle when
there is more Pd0 in the system, but due to some handling
loss of the catalyst during the recycle study, yields are got to somewhat
decreased site. Figure 2c shows the presence of carbon species in fresh and reused catalysts. Figure 2d shows the presence
of oxygen species. Generally, O2 adsorption on Pd happens
as O2 or O species. Moreover, H2O also gets
adsorbed on the Pd surface. Several types of O-containing species
are likely to form. Some of them are easily removed, and Pd sites
are available for catalytic reactions. The others may be difficult
to remove and continue to stay on Pd. This might be the reason for
the presence of two O species initially, and on continuous use of
recycling, the fourth cycle showed one species. For the first and
fourth recycled catalysts, two intensive peaks appear at 617.8 eV
(I 3d5/2) and 629.2 eV (I 3d3/2), which were
assigned to the I 3d region, indicating that adsorption of iodide
atoms takes place on the surface of carbon (Figure 2e).

Furthermore, we have investigated
the hydrogenation of diethyl
oxalate using commercially available catalysts, which are efficient
for the hydrogenation process. It is reported that for hydrogenation
of esters, amides, and carboxylic acid, a Ru-based organometallic
pincer complex is an efficient catalyst.27 The oxalate contains ester functionalities. On the basis of the
literature survey, different Ru-complex catalysts were screened for
hydrogenation of oxalates (Table 3). We have explored various Ru precursors and P-coordinating
ligands such as triphos, PPh3, and 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl
(BINAP) in the present hydrogenation reaction, and the results are
summarized in Table 3. Ru(OAc)2, RuCl2, and Ru(acac)3 were found to be ineffective catalysts along with the P-ligands
(Table 3, entries 1–4).
The pincer complexes such as carbonylhydrido(tetrahydroborato)[bis(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)amino]ruthenium(II)
(Ru-MACHO-BH) and [2-(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)-6-(diethylaminomethyl)pyridine]ruthenium(II)
chlorocarbonyl hydride (Milstein’s catalyst) were found to
be highly active catalysts for the present protocol. Lower yields
of the desired product were observed using Ru-MACHO-BH and Ru-MACHO
as catalysts (Table 3, entries 5 and 7), whereas the yield of EG was increased sharply
to 92% when 1 mol % Milstein’s catalyst was added (Table 3, entry 6). The catalyst
loading of 1 mol % was found to be optimal as the yield reduced to
68% by decreasing the catalyst loading to 0.5% (Table 4, entries 1 and 2). No profound effect was
observed on the yield of the product with an increase in catalyst
loading (Table 4, entry
3).

The influence of different solvents was studied. Among
several
other selected solvents, ethanol was found to be the best solvent
(Table 5, entries 1–3).
The solvents like toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) provided moderate
yield of the desired product. The selection of ethanol also suits
to the entire process as it brings uniform solvent for both the steps
and hence it can be recyclable. The role of bases in the present reaction
was also studied, and it was found that replacement of KOtBu with other bases such as KOH, NaOH, and K2CO3 drastically reduced the yield of the product
(Table 5, entries 3,
4–6). Due to better solubility of KOtBu, both in aqueous and organic media, and its higher basicity,
the reaction proceeds well in the presence of this base. Other bases
failed to give complete reduction of oxamate to ethylene glycol as
most of the inorganic bases have poor solubility in organic solvents.
The catalyst loading of 1.0% was optimal for getting high yield of
the product. A 2% catalyst loading did not show further improvement
in the yield. It might be due to the deactivation/degradation of the
substrate (oxalate) at high catalyst loading.

b GC yield of EG.

The effect of temperature on the yield of the desired product has
been studied. Experiments were carried out at different temperatures
ranging from 80 to 120 °C, in which 100 °C reflects to be
the most favorable temperature for the reaction (Table 5, entries 4, 7, and 8). No significant
effect on the yield of the desired product was observed by increasing
the temperature up to 120 °C (Table 5, entry 8). Pressure also plays an important
role in the effective progress of reaction and yield of the product.
A lower yield of the product was obtained when the reaction was carried
out at a lower H2 pressure (30 atm) (Table 5, entry 9). No major impact on the yield
of the desired product was observed on increasing the pressure (50
atm) (Table 5, entry
10). A H2 pressure of 40 atm was kept for all reactions
at it provides the maximum yield of the desired product. The optimized
time period was 14 h to achieve the maximum yield of the desired product.

Conclusions
In conclusion, an efficient two-step approach for the synthesis
of EG from CO and H2 via oxalate-mediated hydrogenation
has been developed. Notably, in the first step, the synthesis of diethyl
oxalate was achieved using Pd/C as a heterogeneous catalyst. Pd/C
was easily separated from the reaction mixture and reused four times,
demonstrating the recyclable and inexpensive protocol. The hydrogenation
of oxalate to EG was achieved under mild conditions compared with
the previously reported oxamide- and oxamate-mediated hydrogenation.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents and materials were
commercially available and were used as received. Pd/C (10 wt % loading,
matrix: activated carbon support, product number: 205699, brand: Aldrich)
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Gas chromatography PerkinElmer Clarus
400 GC equipped with a flame ionization detector and capillary column
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) and thin layer chromatography
using Merck silica gel 60 F254 plates were used for monitoring the
progress of the reaction. Column chromatography on silica gel (100–200)
mesh has been used for the purification of the product. However, known
compounds were confirmed by comparing with their authentic samples
on GC and GC–mass spectrometry (MS). Shimadzu LCMS-2010EV instrument
(column length, 50 mm; internal diameter, 4.6 mm; particle size, 3
μm; nebulizing gap, 1.5 L/min; vacuum, 10–3 Pa) (column flow 1.2 mL/min; serial temperature, 260 °C; and
heat block temperature, 200 °C) and GCMS-QP 2010 instrument (Rtx-17,
30 m × 25 mm ID; film thickness, 0.25 μm df) (column flow,
2 mL/min; 80–240 °C at 10°/min rise) were used to
get mass spectra. The XPS of Pd/C was measured using a PHI5000 Versa
Probe with a monochromatic focused (100 μm × 100 μm)
Al Kα X-ray radiation (15 kV, 30 mA) and dual beam neutralization
using a combination of argon ion gun and electron irradiation. X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on Shimadzu XRD-6100 using
Cu Kα radiation, 1/4 1.5405 Å, with a scanning rate of
2°/min and 2θ angle ranging from 10 to 85 with current
30 mA and voltage 40 kV. A transmission electron microscope (JEOL
JEM-2100) operating at 200 kV was used to obtain bright field images
of the catalyst.

Two-Step Oxalate-Mediated Production of EG
from CO
Step 1: A reaction mixture containing ethanol (10.0
g, 217 mmol),
tetrabutylammonium iodide (0.2 mmol), and 10% Pd/C (10 mol %) was
prepared and kept in a 100 mL stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave
was closed and pressurized with oxygen (6 atm) and CO (25 atm) without
flushing. The reaction mixture was stirred with a mechanical stirrer
for 8 h at 70 °C. The pressure was released carefully after cooling
to room temperature. The filtered catalyst was washed with ethanol
(25.0 mL), vacuum-dried, and used for the next cycle. The yield (90%)
of the corresponding oxalate formed was confirmed by GC analysis.

Step 2: To the reaction mass was added 80 mL of ethanol followed
by stirring for 30 min. The resulting reaction mass was filtered through
silica gel (2–3 cm pad). The residue was washed with ethanol
(20 mL). The concentration of oxalate in ethanol was found to be 0.143
g/mL (0.01 M), confirmed by GC analysis. An ethanol solution (10 mL)
of oxalate (10 mmol) was added to Milstein’s catalyst (0.01
mmol) and KOtBu (0.05 mmol) under an argon
atmosphere, and the reaction mixture was kept in an autoclave. To
the reaction mixture, 15.0 mL of ethanol was added. The autoclave
was flushed with H2 three times and then pressurized with
H2 to 40 atm. The reaction was carried out at 100 °C
for 14 h. Full conversion of oxalate was detected by GC analysis.
The reaction mass was then cooled to room temperature, and pressure
was released. The reaction mass was passed through the silica gel
(2–3 cm pad) and washed with ethanol. The desired product was
separated from ethanol by distillation with a purity of >92%. The
recovered ethanol was used for the next cycle.
