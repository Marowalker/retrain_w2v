The functionalization
of nanomaterials has long been studied as
a way to manipulate and tailor their properties to a desired application.
Of the various methods available, the Billups–Birch reduction
has become an important and widely used reaction for the functionalization
of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and, more recently, boron nitride nanotubes.
However, an easily overlooked source of error when using highly reductive
conditions is the utilization of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE)
stir bars. In this work, we studied the effects of using this kind
of stir bar versus using a glass stir bar by measuring the resulting
degree of functionalization with 1-bromododecane. Thermogravimetric
analysis studies alone could deceive one into thinking that reactions
stirred with PTFE stir bars are highly functionalized; however, the
utilization of spectroscopic techniques, such as Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, tells
otherwise. Furthermore, in the case of CNTs, we determined that using
Raman spectroscopy alone for analysis is not sufficient to demonstrate
successful chemical modification.

Introduction
The study of nanomaterials,
materials with at least one dimension
smaller than 100 nm, has become a vibrant area of research due to
their unusual properties. The unique ratio of surface area to volume
of nanomaterials results in novel physical, chemical, electronic,
and optical properties.1 In particular,
nanotubes are nanomaterials with diameters ≤100 nm and lengths
typically in the micrometer range. Specifically, carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have proven promising for
a variety of important applications due to their extraordinary properties.

Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), which consist of a sheet of sp2-hybridized carbon atoms (graphene) rolled into a tube, are
by far the most studied type of nanotube. Their properties include
thermal conductivity in the range of 3000–3500 W mK–1 at room temperature2 and Young’s
modulus on the order of terapascals.3 Depending
on their chirality, CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting,4 with ropes of metallic SWCNTs showing an electrical
conductivity of 1 × 104 S cm–1 at
room temperature.5 When CNTs are aligned
into organized macroscopic materials, such as sheets and fibers, the
properties of individual nanotubes can be scaled up and new properties
can be attained. CNTs have been used in a variety of applications
including as additives in composite materials to increase electrical
conductivity, strength, stiffness, and material damping, as coatings
to reduce biofouling and corrosion, and as transparent conducting
films, electromagnetic shields, and microelectronics.6

BNNTs, structural analogues of CNTs with alternating
boron
and nitrogen atoms in place of carbon atoms, have been studied less
than CNTs but have properties that are just as fascinating. BNNTs
have thermal conductivities and mechanical strengths comparable to
CNTs,7,8 but unlike CNTs, they are thermally and
chemically stable in air at temperatures greater than 800 °C,9 are electrically insulating with a band gap of
5–6 eV,10 and are transparent to
visible light.11 These properties complement
those of CNTs and allow for a variety of new applications, including
as additives in transparent polymer composites and composites in high-temperature
oxidizing conditions,12,13 as nanocarriers in medicine,14 and as hydrogen storage media.15

One of the most versatile ways of modulating the
properties of
nanotubes is by chemical attachment of functional groups. Covalent
modification of carbon nanotubes has been explored in many ways; however,
one of the most effective methodologies is to use reductive chemistry,
which involves the reduction of the CNTs to create reactive conditions
that will lead to their chemical modification.16 The production of negatively charged CNTs, or CNT salts,
is possible through several methods, such as contact with a molten
alkali metal17,18 or using conjugated molecules
as electron carriers.19,20 Once the salts are formed, they
need to be dispersed in an aprotic solvent for subsequent functionalization
upon contact with an electrophile. More direct methods that do not
require a dispersion step include electrochemical reduction21 and reaction with organometallic compounds.22−25 Yet another methodology is the Billups–Birch reaction, wherein
an alkali metal is dissolved in liquid ammonia to create an electride
solution that reduces the CNTs, which then react in situ with an alkyl
halide. This one-step method has been used widely to functionalize
the walls of CNTs with a variety of molecules.25−31

As stated before, one of the most attractive properties of
BNNTs
is their chemical inertness toward high-temperature conditions. However,
it is this property that frustrates their covalent functionalization.
Still, there are a few examples of covalent functionalization of BNNTs,
which involve prolonged reflux of the nanomaterials using the functional
group as a solvent32 or the reduction of
the nanotubes using sodium naphtalide as an electron carrier.33 Recently, we reported the functionalization
of BNNTs using the Billups–Birch reduction to afford functionalized
BNNTs.34 During our initial experiments,
we noticed that BNNTs, which are white by nature, will gain gray color
after the reaction. This was accompanied by the emergence of black
color on the poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) stir bars. Control experiments
without the addition of the alkyl halide showed that the material
still presents a reasonable weight loss when analyzed by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and will also gain dark gray color, even when functionalization
was not expected. A potential source of side reactions that could
easily be overlooked is the PTFE stir bar. In many publications, the
stirring method is not mentioned but could potentially be interfering
in functionalization reactions. PTFE has been mentioned to react under
the Birch reduction conditions, causing defluorination and darkening
of the material.35 This can be easily overlooked
in CNT functionalization since the final material is black. In this
work, we provide evidence that using PTFE-coated stir bars decreases
the degree of functionalization from added grafting groups in carbon
and boron nitride nanotubes. Thermogravimetric analysis and spectroscopic
techniques are employed to show how the use of glass stir bars enhances
the degree of functionalization as compared to that of PTFE-coated
stirring. These are important considerations for the functionalization
of nanomaterials using strongly reducing conditions.

Results and Discussion
CNTs and BNNTs were functionalized with dodecyl chains using 1-bromododecane
through the Billups–Birch reaction employing either glass or
PTFE stir bars (see Scheme S1). Bromododecane
was used given its long aliphatic chain will allow for a better detection
in the different characterization studies. Functionalization was first
assessed with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under argon. By measuring
the weight change as a function of the temperature, we expect to see
a loss in the mass due to the desorption of moieties, as well as adsorbates,
that we anticipate come from the work-up process. We will analyze
the functionalization of CNTs first in the following sections as it
is a more studied case.

For pristine CNTs, the thermogram (Figure 1a) shows a flat line
when heated under argon
since there are no groups to be desorbed from the material. Examining
the controls (CNTs that were submitted to the Billups–Birch
conditions but without adding bromododecane) with this technique provides
us with an estimate of any side functionalization coming from the
work-up process. In this case, the control experiments indeed show
some weight loss, as can be observed in Figure 1a (Tc-CNTs and gc-CNTs for PTFE- and glass-stirred
control reactions, respectively). Given that the control experiments
do not involve any added aliphatic groups, upon evaporation of ammonia,
unreacted carbon nanotube salts are free to react with any proton
source coming from the work-up process, which, in this case are water,
ethanol, and hydrochloric acid. Although there are no reports of similar
control experiments to support this claim, there are a few examples
of reported hydrogenation of carbon nanostructures employing the Billups–Birch
conditions using alcohols or water as means of hydrogenation.26,36−38 As such, we suspect that solvent adsorption and hydrogenation
could be happening on the nanotube scaffold, causing the loss in weight
when heated. As seen in Figure 1a, the functionalized CNTs (Tf-CNTs and gf-CNTs for PTFE-
and glass-stirred reactions, respectively) show a distinct behavior,
where they display a decrease in weight spanning from 150 °C
until 700 °C that is consistent with desorption of alkyl addends.
In addition to the initial significant weight loss, the f-CNTs show
a slight and constant drop in weight at higher temperatures, possibly
from further defunctionalization of more obstructed functional groups.

infrared spectra, and (d) amplification of the aliphatic region.

Interestingly, although the Tc-CNTs
lost more weight than gc-CNTs,
the reverse happened on the functionalized CNTs. As mentioned before,
it has been reported that PTFE reacts with metals such as sodium,39 lithium,40 and even
magnesium41 under the Birch conditions.
In the same regard, some authors have published that fluorinated nanomaterials
undergo defluorination as well.42,43 Chakrabarti and Jacobus
studied the reaction of PTFE with lithium in liquid ammonia and reported
that the after product in occasions turned dark, which is what happens
to the stir bar post reaction (Figure S1). Brecht and co-workers suggested that, unless exposed to oxygen,
a foil of PTFE exposed to sodium in liquid ammonia could contain carbon
radicals.40 Such findings could indicate
that the control experiment using the PTFE stir bar is losing more
weight due to possible side reactions with the reactive material exfoliated
off the stir bar or due to defluorinated PTFE peeling off from the
stir bar into the final product. In the functionalized CNTs, there
are two possible causes for the difference in weight loss between
the two samples. First, the supply of electrons intended to drive
the Billups–Birch reaction for the covalent attachment of aliphatic
groups to the CNTs is also reacting with the PTFE stir bar, depleting
the source of the reducing agent, which is critical for the reaction
to proceed. Previous studies have demonstrated that PTFE under Billups–Birch
conditions will result in complex products including fluoride anions,
alkyl radicals, and olefins.40 Second,
if any alkyl radicals are forming from the PTFE coating, they could
also be reacting with 1-bromododecane, which would explain a lower
yield in the reaction with CNTs. A plausible competing reaction is
that alkyl radicals from detached fragments of the PTFE after defluorination
react with CNT. The first derivative of the TGA curves (DTG) of
gf-CNT and Tf-CNTs show a broader peak for Tf-CNTs, consistent with
a more complex material (Supporting Information, Figure S2). It is important to note that this
observation can be easily overlooked, given that the PTFE stir bar
exposed to Billups–Birch conditions results in a black coating
of the stir bar that could be wrongly associated with CNTs deposition
(which would also produce a black coating on the stir bar).

From the thermograms in Figure 1a, we can estimate the number of addends covalently
attached to the nanotubes scaffold. With the aid of the control materials,
we estimate the extent of side functionalization and adsorbed solvent
molecules. Because we are assuming that this weight loss is inherent
to the process, the weight loss of the controls was subtracted from
that of their respective f-CNTs to obtain the net degree of functionalization
due to alkyl moieties. Figure 2b summarizes the weight loss of each CNTs sample measured
at 900 °C. After heating, the Tc-CNTs and gc-CNTs lost 18.2%
and 12.2%, respectively. Subtracting such values from the functionalized
samples, we determined the “corrected” weight loss of
Tf-CNTs and gf-CNTs to be 6.8 and 14.4%, respectively (7.6% weight
difference). Therefore, we estimate that there is roughly one dodecyl
chain per 71 carbon atoms in the gf-CNTs and one chain per ca. 155
atoms in the Tf-CNTs, assuming that all of the weight loss is due
to the alkyl chains.

the Raman mapping showing the D/G ratio at 532 and 785 nm excitation.
(c) Two-dimensional plot depicting the Raman defect index (RDI) and

As part of the characterization of functionalized nanotubes,
we
also utilized infrared spectroscopy (Fourier transform infrared, FTIR)
to confirm the presence of the C–H stretching vibration (C–Hst) in the region between 2800 and 3000 cm–1. Although the CNTs spectrum is featureless, both gf-CNTs and Tf-CNTs
show transitions consistent with aliphatic vibrations (Figure 2c). The amplified aliphatic
region in Figure 2d
shows that the Tf-CNTs aliphatic vibrations are less intense than
those of gf-CNTs, which is consistent with the TGA experiments. The
bands between 2250 and 2500 cm–1 are due to CO2 from the environment. Both control experiments show little
presence of aliphatic vibrations, consistent with the lack of dodecyl
chains on the CNTs.

Complementing the results found by TGA and
FTIR, we gained more
insight into the chemical bonds found in the CNTs samples by performing
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The high-resolution spectra
of the C 1s for the pristine material and f-CNTs are shown in Figure 2a, and the survey
scans can be found in Figure S3. We can
observe that the C 1s peak for the pristine material was deconvoluted
into five components. The most prominent signal at 284.6 eV corresponds
to the C=C binding energy and the signal
at 285.6 eV to C–C. The next signals,
at 286.7 and 288.9 eV, correspond to C–O
and C=O binding energies, respectively.44 Finally, at 291.0 eV, we can find the π–π*
shake-up feature, attributed to sp2 hybridization.45 The C 1s peak in gf-CNTs was deconvoluted into
five components as well, with small shifts in some of the components.
Nonetheless, unlike the other two samples, the spectrum of Tf-CNTs
shows an additional binding energy at 289.6 eV, which corresponds
to a perfluorinated carbon binding energy, so we can safely assume
that this peak corresponds to C–F2. We believe that the carbon bound to fluorine found in the
C 1s could come from PTFE stir bar residues exfoliated during the
reaction. The F 1s peak observed in Tf-CNTs was deconvoluted into
two peaks: one at 686.7 eV corresponding to F1–C and one at 689.6 eV corresponding to the F2–C.44 The
C 1s binding energies of all samples and their full width at half
maximum values can be found in Table S1.

Carbon nanotubes possess sp2 hybridization over
their
entire structure, except where sp3 hybridized defects occur.46,47 Upon functionalization, we expect that the attachment of alkyl groups
causes some rehybridization from sp2 to sp3 (defects
in the sp2 network).48−50 Therefore, we calculated the
percentage of the total area that each deconvoluted binding energy
occupies within the C 1s peak to obtain qualitative understanding
of such rehybridization upon functionalization (Table 1). If we calculate the ratio between C=C
and C–C, we find that following functionalization both f-CNTs
samples have a decrease in the amount of sp2 carbon atoms
with a corresponding increase in sp3 carbon atoms. This
observation agrees with the nature of rehybridization upon the creation
of defects. Furthermore, rehybridization can also be assessed by looking
at the change in intensity of the π–π* shake-up
satellite. This feature decreases as we go from pristine to functionalized
CNTs with a larger decrease seen in Tf-CNTs. This tells us that Tf-CNTs
have a greater disruption in their sp2 network than the
others, which agrees with the increased intensity of the C–C peak. It is possible that PTFE chains bind
to multiple places in the same CNT wall, creating more defects in
Tf-CNTs.

Energies Deconvoluted from the C 1s Peak of CNTs and f-CNTs

As a final means of f-CNTs characterization, we investigated
their
chemical modification using Raman spectroscopy by measuring the ratio
between the defect-induced D-band (1300–1400 cm–1) and the G-band (∼1600 cm–1).51 Although it is a useful technique, performing
single scan points in a sample could lead to large variations; however,
scanning Raman spectroscopy encompasses a broader area and provides
a better understanding of the characteristics of the material; in
this case, an area of 200 × 200 μm2 was scanned
for each CNT sample. Hirsch and co-workers first used scanning Raman
spectroscopy to interrogate the properties of functionalized CNTs
using statistical Raman spectroscopy.52 In their work, the authors scanned an area of the functionalized
CNT material and obtained a histogram of the D/G ratio distribution
that was fitted with a Gaussian function. From the Gaussian fitting,
it was possible to calculate the Raman defect index (RDI) or mean
degree of functionalization and the Raman homogeneity index (RHI);
for details on this process, refer to the Supporting Information.

Each CNT sample was analyzed with 532 and
785 nm excitation lasers
to excite metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, respectively. For
visualization purposes, Figure 2b only shows the results for pristine CNTs and f-CNTs and
the rest of the samples can be found in Figure S4. Table 2 shows
the RDI and RHI values, which can be visually inspected in a plot
of I(D/G)532 against I(D/G)785 (Figure 2c). Pristine CNTs have an RDI value of 0.13
and an RHI value of 1187. Any RDI value higher than 0.13 represents
a higher degree of defects and any RHI value lower than 1187 would
represent a more heterogeneous sample, whereas a higher RHI value
would represent a more homogeneous sample. Both of the f-CNTs have
a higher RDI, which is consistent with the increase in the C–C binding energy and a decrease in the π–π*
satellite in the XPS experiments. It is worth pointing out that the
XPS and Raman data demonstrate a higher degree of defects in Tf-CNTs,
but this contrasts the barely noticeable C–Hst vibrations
in FTIR and relatively low weight loss due to functionalization when
heated; thus, in this case, the larger number of defects does not
necessarily translate to functionalization with alkyl chains. It is
important to remember that not all sp3 defects are generated
by covalent functionalization, but they could also be due to the creation
of vacancies from the harsh chemical environment.53 In addition, the attachment of carbonaceous aliphatic chains
from the stir bar at different sites in the CNTs would lead to features
consistent with those visualized by XPS, Raman, and FTIR, since these
chains have weaker C–H vibrations but likely attach in multiple
places. For the same reason, during PTFE stirring, part of the defluorinated
PTFE from the stir bar is likely being attached to the CNTs in addition
to the alkyl chains. Comparing the control experiments, we can see
that Tc-CNTs are slightly more defective than gc-CNTs, which was expected
based on the TGA data.

Another important feature
of the plot presented in Figure 2c is the location of each sample
within the plot, that is, in the metallic or semiconducting region.
The starting material lies almost on the limit between the two areas,
demonstrating that both types of nanotubes are equally defective.
All samples, except for Tf-CNTs, lie in the metallic region and that
is expected given that those are preferentially modified due to their
enhanced reactivity.54−58 Tf-CNTs lie in the limit of the two areas and look as if the CNTs
have been randomly modified.

So far, our results indicate that
the presence of PTFE in reductive
conditions not only hampers functionalization of CNTs but may also
mislead one into believing a proper alkylation has occurred. To confirm
the effect of PTFE on the functionalization of CNTs using the Billups–Birch
reaction, we performed additional control experiments on CNTs following
the same procedure as with gf-CNTs and cg-CNTs, except that a porous
PTFE membrane was added to the reaction on purpose. Figure S5 shows the characterization of such materials. The
FTIR in Figure S5a revealed that only gf-CNTs
in the presence of PTFE (gf-CNTs + PTFE) possesses CHst vibrations, which, incidentally, are weaker than any of the f-CNTs
described earlier, likely due to competing reactions with PTFE. Moreover,
gc-CNTs + PTFE shows a 15% weight loss (Figure S5b), similar to the Tc-CNT weight loss in Figure 1, which is likely due to hydrogenation
and PTFE. On the other hand, gf-CNTs + PTFE showed a weight loss of
28%. As expected, this weight loss is larger due to the added functionalization
of the bromododecane. Finally, Raman spectroscopy showed that both
samples are similarly defective, indicating that PTFE induces defects
on CNTs (Figure S5c).

To this point,
we have shown that covalent functionalization of
CNTs with an electride solution is hampered by using a PTFE stir bar,
particularly if haloalkanes are expected to be grafted on the nanotube
walls. To further confirm this, we explored the effect of PTFE and
glass-covered stir bars on the functionalization of BNNTs using similar
techniques. BNNTs intrinsically lack carbon, so any signal from carbon
must come from exogenous addends in the reaction mixture. As previously
mentioned, because of the black color of carbon nanotubes, the interference
of PTFE on the reaction is not detectable with the naked eye. However,
because BNNTs are white, the colors of the final products are visually
different (see Figure S6), where it is
clear that those nanotubes in contact with the PTFE became darker.

The thermograms of all BNNTs samples are shown in Figure 3a. The weight loss of pristine
BNNTs is ca. 1.2%, possibly due to adsorbed solvents coming from the
purification process (water and ethanol). The rest of the BNNTs samples
follow the same trend as the CNTs, wherein the control prepared with
the PTFE stir bar loses more weight than the one prepared with a glass
stir bar and the opposite trend occurs within the f-BNNTs. The BNNT
samples present stepwise losses as well; first, they show a decrease
in temperature spanning from 200 °C and then another at ca. 480
°C. From the thermograms, the number of addends covalently attached
to the nanotubes scaffold can also be estimated in the same fashion
as with CNTs. Figure 3b summarizes the weight loss of each BNNT sample measured at 900
°C and also the net functionalization of f-BNNTs after subtracting
the weight loss from the control experiments. The weight subtraction
of the controls allows us to estimate the degree of functionalization
due to alkyl attachment. As such, we estimated that 15.5% of weight
in gf-BNNTs is lost by desorption of alkyl chains, whereas only 7.7%
of weight is lost is due to alkyl functionalities in Tf-BNNTs (6.5%
weight difference). Using the corrected weight loss values, we estimated
that there is one alkyl chain per 36 BN units in gf-BNNTs, whereas
there is only one chain per 73 BN units in the case of Tf-BNNTs, assuming
that the weight loss is attributed exclusively to aliphatic carbon
chains.

Figure 3c shows
the typical infrared spectrum for pristine BNNTs that presents the
in-plane B–N stretching at 1350 cm–1 and
the out-of-plane B–N bending at 802 cm–1.
Upon functionalization, f-BNNTs present a set of peaks corresponding
to C–Hst transitions as an additional feature, indicating
the presence of alkyl chains. Figure 3d presents an enlargement of the area between 2600
and 3200 cm–1, showing that the C–Hst is significantly more intense in gf-BNNTs in comparison with that
in Tf-BNNTs. Also, functionalized BNNTs show a small shift to lower
energies in the B–N stretching region that is attributed to
lattice deformation in the functionalized materials.33 Even the Tc-BNNTs have some C–Hst vibrations
that we believe come from the PTFE stir bar as the gc-BNNTs lack this
feature.

Further spectroscopic studies were also performed on
BNNTs powders;
in this case, high-resolution XPS is shown in Figure 4 and XPS surveys are found in Figure S7; the detailed information for all binding
energies are found in Table S2. In the
B 1s and N 1s spectra, the pristine material exhibits the common binding
energies values of 190.6 and 398.4 eV for B–N and N–B, respectively.59 Additionally, the B
1s and N 1s in the pristine material also show additional small peaks
at 192.3 and 399.7 eV, respectively, that have been reported to be
due to oxides.60 The B 1s spectra of both
f-BNNTs show an increase of the peak attributed to the B–O
binding energy, possibly due to further oxidation or functionalization
with hydroxyl groups during the work-up process. Moreover, the two
f-BNNTs show an additional peak at around 189 eV that correlates to
the B–C binding energy;61 it is
noticeable that the B–C component in Tf-BNNTs is qualitatively
smaller than that in gf-BNNTs. In the N 1s spectrum, there is a slight
decrease in the N–O component for gf-BNNTs but we do not discount
that nitrogen could also be functionalized, and therefore, this deconvoluted
peak could also have some N–C nature. In the case of the C
1s, pristine BNNTs also show a carbon signal but this is likely due
to adventitious carbon, as this material did not undergo functionalization.
As for the f-BNNTs, they have lost the feature coming from C=O, further confirming that the carbon previously
seen in pristine BNNTs is from an adventitious source. Additionally,
they both were deconvoluted into a new peak corresponding to the C–B binding energy at ca. 284 eV. Careful inspection
of the Tf-BNNTs survey shows that there is a small jump of the baseline
at 687 eV, which is the value of F 1s, but because of the low intensity,
it could not be analyzed with higher resolution. The low amount of
fluorine is not a surprise, given that Birch conditions will cause
defluorination of PTFE. It is evident from the TGA and FTIR that the
gf-BNNTs are functionalized to a greater extent than the Tf-BNNTs
due to the competing role of the PTFE stir bar in the latter case.
This is also supported by the XPS, given that the contribution of
the B–C component to the B 1s spectra
is qualitatively greater in the gf-BNNTs than that in the Tf-BNNTs.

XPS spectra of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs),
PTFE-stirred BNNTs (Tf-BNNTs), and glass-stirred BNNTs (gf-BNNTs).

Finally, another feature that
can be analyzed from the B 1s peak
in the BNNTs samples is the π–π* shake-up satellite,
which is also related to sp2-hybridized boron.59 As such, Figure S8 shows that this feature decreases in Tf-BNNTs and even more in gf-BNNTs.
Thus, confirming the fact that, upon functionalization, rehybridization
occurs.

Conclusions
Here, we present the functionalization
of carbon nanotubes and
boron nitride nanotubes with alkyl chains using the Billups–Birch
reduction. The two reactions were stirred using glass stir bars and
PTFE stir bars to demonstrate that the PTFE stir bars hinder the functionalization
process, possibly due to competing reactions related to the PTFE coating.
TGA analysis of the samples show that the control experiments with
PTFE lose more weight than control experiments with glass, indicating
that PTFE is contributing to the weight of the material. Conversely,
upon functionalization, the glass-stirred samples lose more weight
due to a higher degree of functionalization from the alkyl chains.
The infrared and XPS spectra also support the fact that the degree
of alkyl functionalization is greater in those stirred with a glass
stir bar. Additionally, we further confirmed covalent modification
with XPS by observing how there is greater sp2 to sp3 rehybridization in both kinds of nanotubes.

It is important
to address that the reactions expected from CNT
and BNNTs under Billups–Birch conditions are the same. The
reason for presenting both cases (CNT and BNNTs) is that for BNNTs,
since they intrinsically do not contain carbon, the effect of PTFE
is more apparent (see data for Tc-BNNTs vs gc-BNNTs). On the other
hand, for CNTs, we used statistical Raman analysis and found that
the PTFE-stirred Tf-CNTs are more defective than gf-CNTs. Raman spectroscopy
is an easy, fast, and straightforward technique to characterize CNTs,
which is the reason why it is widely used to address functionalization.
Nonetheless, we see here that a larger defect index is not an absolute
proof of greater functionalization; Raman spectroscopy must, therefore,
be complemented with other types of techniques.

With this work,
we provide evidence that, although it could be
easily overlooked, the use of a PTFE stir bar is detrimental to achieving
the functionalization of nanostructures under Billups–Birch
conditions. To the best of our knowledge, the exclusion of PTFE bars
from this kind of experiments has not been addressed previously in
the literature.

Materials and Methods
Boron nitride
nanotubes (BNNTs) were obtained from BNNT, LLC (P1β
type) and purified according to a method published elsewhere.62 HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
(NanoIntegris HR32-009) were purified following a reported methodology.28 Lithium and 1-bromododecane were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, and anhydrous ammonia was from Airgas.

Functionalization
of Boron Nitride Nanotubes (f-BNNTs)
In a typical experiment,
30 mg of BNNTs (1.2 mmol BN) were placed
in a 250 mL oven-dried round-bottom flask. Under vacuum, all glassware
was flame-dried. Next, lithium was added (334 mg, 48 mmol) and the
system was purged three times with argon. The system was cooled with
an acetone/dry-ice bath to condense roughly 125 mL of anhydrous ammonia.
The reagents were allowed to exfoliate for an hour with constant replenishment
of the cold bath. Later, the cold bath was removed and 2.9 mL of 1-bromododecane
(12 mmol) was added dropwise and the ammonia was allowed to evaporate
overnight. For the work-up process, the reaction vessel was cooled
down with an ice bath and 30 mL of a mixture of water/ethanol (3:1)
was added dropwise under argon to quench any unreacted lithium, followed
by 10% w/w HCl until an acidic pH was reached. Quenching was followed
by extraction with n-hexanes; the organic layer and
interphase were collected and washed two more times with water. Later,
the product was filtered through a 0.4 μm PTFE membrane and
washed thoroughly with more n-hexanes and ethanol,
in that order. The material was oven-dried under vacuum at 120 °C
overnight before any characterization. Two materials were produced
this way, one was stirred using a glass-covered stir bar and another
one using a PTFE-coated stir bar to produce gf-BNNTs and Tf-BNNTs,
respectively.

Functionalization of Carbon Nanotubes
CNTs were functionalized
in a similar way as BNNTs. In this case, 20 mg of CNTs (1.7 mmol)
was exfoliated with 473.3 mg of lithium (68 mmol) and later functionalized
with 4.1 mL of 1-bromododecane (17 mmol). Likewise, the CNTs that
were stirred during the reaction with a glass stir bar produced gf-CNTs
and those stirred with a PTFE stir bar produced Tf-CNTs.

Control Samples
Control experiments were prepared using
the same conditions as in the functionalization except for the addition
of 1-bromododecane to produce gc-CNTs, Tc-CNTs, gc-BNNTs, and Tc-BNNTs.

Instrumentation
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra
are the average of 64 scans recorded using a Nicolet 6700 with an
ATR accessory and a resolution of 4 cm–1. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained with a PHI
Quantera SXM scanning X-ray microprobe system using a pass energy
of 26 eV for high-resolution spectra and a 126 eV pass energy for
the surveys. The samples were measured as a powder, and their fitting
was performed with MultiPak Spectrum software wherein the backgrounds
were subtracted and their peaks shifted in reference to a C 1s value
of 284.8 eV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a
Q-600 Simultaneous TGA/DSC from TA Instruments. The samples were heated
under argon to 115 °C and kept at that temperature for 15 min
to remove any adsorbates, and were then heated to 1000 °C at
a rate of 10 °C min–1. For Raman spectroscopy,
the CNTs were analyzed using a Renishaw Raman Microscope RE04 with
532 and 785 nm lasers and mapped in a 200 × 200 μm2 area.
