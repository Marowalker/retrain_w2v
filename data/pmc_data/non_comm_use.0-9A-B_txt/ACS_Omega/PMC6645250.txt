In the current paper, a series of
nonlinear optical (NLO) active
devices was prepared by utilizing stereolithographic three-dimensional
printing technique. Microcrystalline NLO active component, urea, or
potassium dihydrogen phosphate was dispersed in a simple photopolymerizable
polyacrylate-based resin and used as the printing material to fabricate
highly efficient transparent NLO lenses. The nonlinear activity of
the printed lenses was confirmed by second-harmonic generation measurements
using a femtosecond laser-pumped optical parametric amplifier operating
at a wavelength of 1195 nm. The three-dimensional printing provides
a simple method to utilize a range of NLO active compounds without
tedious crystal growing and processing steps. Furthermore, introducing
NLO additives in the printing material provides an easy and cost-efficient
way to manufacture lenses with NLO functionality.

Introduction
The research on nonlinear
optical (NLO) materials dates back to
the early days of lasers. Franken et al. reported the observation
of second-harmonic generation (SHG) phenomenon already in 1961.1 In SHG, two photons having the same frequency
are combined in a medium generating radiation that has twice the frequency
(“frequency doubling”) and thus half the wavelength
of the original photons. Half a century later, SHG still remains as
one of the most investigated NLO property owing to its potential applications
in laser technology and optoelectronics.2,3 Especially,
the growing interest in processes such as optical signal processing
and electro-optical switches4 has been
fueling the research in the field of NLO materials and devices.5,6

Most commonly used NLO devices contain large single crystals
of
the active material. Although a variety of NLO active materials, both
inorganic and organic, are known, only a limited number of these are
commercially used. The advantages of the most commonly used inorganic
compounds, such as β-barium borate7 and potassium titanyl phosphate,8,9 arise from
the wide-transparency regions, wide phase matching range, and high
conversion efficiency, as well as high physical and chemical stability
and durability. Due to these reasons, the selection of commercial
materials has remained nearly unchanged for decades even though numerous
new inorganic and organic materials have shown superior NLO properties.10−12 Especially, various organic compounds have displayed a number of
NLO properties that clearly exceed that of the commercial inorganic
crystals.10−14 Unfortunately, many of these organic NLO components suffer from
inferior stability and malleability, which has hindered their utilization
in optical devices. However, the stability problems of certain NLO
films have been successfully tackled by using specific preparation
techniques based on self-assembly of the NLO compounds.15,16 Despite the steps taken forward, assembling molecules or the need
to grow single crystals of high quality and substantial size have
still limited the use of wider selection of organic compounds. Crystallization
techniques such as top-seeded solution growth technique, Czochralski
technique, and hydrothermal methods, commonly used for inorganic compounds,
are often less suitable for organic materials.17,18 Furthermore, the mechanical processing of NLO crystals, required
to meet the demands of optical components, may be inapplicable for
organic crystals. One way around these problems is to fabricate thin
films by the poling technique where the organic NLO chromophore is
mixed with a polymer matrix. In this technique, the dipoles of the
NLO components are aligned by an external electric field.19,20 Again, this method is not suitable for all organic NLO compounds.
Another potential solution would be utilization of microcrystalline
materials, instead of large single crystals, as in the Kurtz–Perry
technique, which is used for measuring SHG properties.21 However, the powdery material is difficult to
handle and therefore poorly applicable for practical NLO use as it
is.

In this paper, we present a method for manufacturing NLO
active
devices from microcrystalline NLO components by three-dimensional
(3D) printing. In this method, the chromophore microcrystals, such
as urea or potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), are mixed with photopolymerizable
polyacrylate-based resin, commonly used as printing material in stereolithographic
(SLA) 3D printing technique. The 3D printing opens possibilities of
tailor-made size, shape and, optical properties of the printed objects.
The 3D printing has already been successfully used for printing high-quality
lenses.22 By using an NLO additive in the
printing material, it is possible to prepare lenses with NLO properties.
Use of polymer matrix also serves as a protecting media for the NLO
component. This makes it possible to utilize a whole range of less
stable organic compounds as NLO chromophores.

Results and Discussion
The 3D printing experiments were conducted by adding microcrystalline
urea or potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) as the NLO active component
in the printable photopolymer matrix. Both of these highly effective
NLO chromophores are commonly used reference materials in the SHG
measurements carried out by the Kurtz–Perry powder method.21,23,24 A series of round NLO lenses
with 5 wt % urea or KDP were printed by SLA technique. The diameter
of the printed objects was 2 cm, and the thicknesses 300, 600, 900,
1200, and 1500 μm (Figure 1). As can be seen in Figure 1, both additives were uniformly dispersed
throughout the objects. Furthermore, the additives retained their
original microcrystalline structure even after the printing process.

lens without the NLO component. (b, d) The 300 μm thick NLO
lens with 5 wt % KDP. (c, e) The 300 μm thick NLO lens with
5 wt % urea.

The 3D printed NLO lenses’
ability to generate the second-harmonic
signal was confirmed by measurements with an amplified femtosecond
laser (Integra-C, Quantronix)-pumped tunable optical parametric amplifier
(TOPAS, Light Conversion Ltd.) operating at 1195 nm. A laser beam
of 3 mm (full width at half maximum, FWHM), a 130 fs pulse width,
and 8 μJ of pulse energy was aimed at the middle of each object,
and the intensity of the second-harmonic wavelength generated was
measured through the accumulation of 10 consecutive pulses. Relatively
wide laser beam was used to obtain an average result covering the
whole lens.

With both urea and KDP lenses, the intensity of
the SHG signal
increased with the increasing thickness of the object (Figures S1, S2 and Table S1). The intensities
of the SHG signals relative to the thickness of the lens are shown
in Figure 2. With KDP,
the intensity grew nearly linearly. The small deviations from the
linear growth are likely due to inherently random orientations of
the microcrystals inside the NLO lens. In the case of urea, the linear
growth started to level after 1200 μm thickness. After certain
thickness, the increased amount of microcrystals, crystal-to-crystal
interactions, and decreasing transparency effectively reduce the intensity
more than the new microcrystals increase it.

on the integrated surface areas of the SHG
signals for KDP and urea lenses as the function of lens thickness.

Organic polymers typically absorb
UV radiation. Depending on the
material, the absorption cutoff point can be reached already in the
visible region. This must be kept in mind when choosing the matrix
polymer. Therefore, the UV/vis spectrum of the printed acrylate polymer
was measured in the range of 890–300 nm (Figures S3 and S4). Significant absorption started at ca.
420 nm, indicating the apparent cutoff wavelength for this material.
Although the absorption of the polymer sets the limit for the usable
wavelengths, it does not necessarily set additional limitations in
the case of objects with organic NLO chromophores. It should be noted
that also the organic NLO components tend to absorb strongly in the
UV region.25,26 Consequently, a similar cutoff
would occur even without the polymer matrix.

The results show
that stereolithography 3D printing can be utilized
to produce highly efficient NLO lenses by using simple and readily
available materials. Both urea- and KDP-based objects displayed significant
ability to generate second-harmonic signal. The 3D printing method
introduced here provides a way to considerably extend the selection
of NLO active compounds that can be used for practical NLO devices.
One of the main advantages of this novel approach is that there is
no need for tedious preprocessing steps usually required when conventional
NLO crystals are manufactured. Use of polymer matrix can also protect
the highly efficient but less stable organic NLO compounds, which
makes also those materials available for NLO applications. The ability
to design the shape and size of the NLO lenses makes 3D printing a
powerful tool for both research and manufacturing of new and improved
electro-optical devices. It is already well established that 3D printing
can be used to produce lenses with high-quality optical properties.
We believe that by combining the choice of efficient NLO compounds
with the optical design of the object can open up a whole new era
in manufacturing NLO lenses.

Methods
Materials
The
acrylate-based resin used in 3D printing
was purchased from PeoPoly. Urea was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(ACS Reagent, 99.0–100.5%) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate
(KDP) from Merck (≥99.5%). All chemicals were used as received.
High-purity water of 18.2 MΩ cm resistivity was used throughout
the experiments.

Preparation of the NLO Lenses
Approximately,
55 mL
of a commercial acrylate-based resin was weighed in a beaker and mixed
with 5 wt % urea or KDP. The
NLO components had been sifted through 125 μm sieve to obtain
uniform crystal sizes. The mixtures were carefully stirred before
printing until a homogeneous printing material was obtained. The mixture
was used for SLA 3D printing immediately after the preparation. After
the 3D printing, the objects were first washed thoroughly with ethanol
and water and then cured using 405 nm UV lamp for 10 min to make sure
that the polymerization was complete. The fully cured printed objects
were coated with sprayed lacquer to improve the transparency.

Three-Dimensional
Printing
The models of the NLO lenses
were designed by FreeCad v.0.16 software. The PeoPoly version of the
Cura 2.6.2.-14 and B9Creator v.1.1.0. was used for preparing the models
for printing. All objects were printed with the PeoPoly Moai SLA 3D
printer operating with a 150 mW 405 nm laser. The layer height used
for preparation of the objects was 50 μm.

NLO Measurements
The SHG measurements were conducted
using a widely tunable optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light
Conversion Ltd.) pumped by an amplified femtosecond laser (Integra-C,
Quantronix). OPA signal beam output at 1195 nm was used to generate
second harmonic on the samples. The beam size at the sample was 3
mm (FWHM). The pulse duration was ∼130 fs, and pulse energy
was 8 μJ. Exposure time of 0.217 s was used for urea lenses,
whereas 2.17 s was used for KDP lenses.

UV/Vis Measurements
UV/vis spectrum of the printed
polymer was measured from 890 to 300 nm using a PerkinElmer Lambda
25 UV/vis spectrophotometer. The analyzed NLO lens used as a sample
was placed in front of the sample cuvette holder, and the reference
cuvette holder was left empty as air was used as reference. A slit
of 1.0 nm was used, with a scan speed of 240 nm/min and a data interval
of 5.0 nm.
