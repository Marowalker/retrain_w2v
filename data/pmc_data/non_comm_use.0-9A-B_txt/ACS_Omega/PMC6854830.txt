Full closure of the nuclear fuel
cycle is predicated, in part,
on defining efficient separations processes for the effective speciation
of the neutron-absorbing lanthanides from the minor actinides post-PUREX.
Pursuant to the aforementioned, a class of tridentate, Lewis basic
procomplexants have been prepared leveraging a Pd-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling between 6-bromo-[1,2,4]-triazinylpyridine derivatives
and various protected indole-boronic acids to afford functionalized
2-[6-(5,6-diphenyl-[1,2,4]triazin-3-yl)-pyridin-2-yl]-1H-indoles. A highly active catalyst/ligand system with low loadings
was employed rapidly affording 26 examples in yields as high as 85%.
Method optimization, substrate and indole scope, comparative analysis
between coupling reagents, and a scale-up experiment are reported.

==== Body
Introduction
Heteroarene constructs
bearing the indole functionality are ubiquitous
in biologically active natural products,1 medicinal chemistry,2 synthesis,3 and related areas.4 Use of complexant scaffolds with the indole moiety in the context
of radiochemical liquid–liquid separations of actinides from
lanthanides has yet to appear. Sequestration of the minor actinides
from the lanthanides is necessary for the use of these radionuclides
in advanced fuels for further transmutation toward diminishing radiotoxicity,
heat load, and long-term storage requirements of spent nuclear fuel
in a geologic repository.5 Lewis basic
scaffolds with soft donor atoms, specifically, N, and based on the
CHON principle,6 have demonstrated effective
performance in this area since Kolarik’s disclosure of alkyl
bis-triazinyl-1,2,4-triazine complexants (BTPs) for minor actinide
separations.7 In an effort to further define
structure–activity relationships to potentially improve complexant
performance, our lab has been engaged in the pursuit of scaffolds,
which afford opportunities to leverage modular concepts for complexant
construction.

We were interested in exploring the potential
of tridentate, soft-Lewis
basic [1,2,4] triazinyl-pyridin-2-yl complexants with an indole appendage
in separations. A primary challenge in this area of separation science
is to design a complexant, which displays significant binding affinity
for the minor actinides over lanthanides while maximizing the covalency
of the f-orbital interaction8 of the metal–ligand
complex to afford selective speciation, while at the same time providing
an opportunity for subsequent stripping and reuse of the complexant
for additional separations. Further issues include dissolution of
a relatively planar, polar heteroaromatic scaffold in diluents with
low polarity and facilitating good kinetics of complexation.9

Facile phase separation in strongly acidic
media involving HNO3 also presents issues. The diminished
basicity of the indole
N could offer potential in this area due to the lone pair participation
in the aromaticity of the heterocycle and concomitant diminished potential
for appreciable protonation under separation conditions. The complexants
of current synthetic interest also possess structural characteristics
to form “semifrustrated” Lewis acid/base pairs10 due to the N–H bond, which may influence
complexation. Metal-mediated coupling approaches to the formation
of advanced heteroarenes have been facilitated by the Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling reaction of relevant organoboron moieties with a suitable
electrophile leveraging Pd-catalysis. The versatility of this approach
facilitated our interest in the development of this method for accessing
procomplexants via cross-coupling with heteroarylboronic acids.

Results
and Discussion
Table 1 describes
selected efforts toward optimization of the desired Pd-catalyzed bond
formation between 3-(6-bromo-pyridin-2-yl)-5,6-diphenyl-[1,2,4]triazine
(1) and (1-(tert-butylcarbonyl)-5-(methoxy)-indol-2-yl)boronic
acid utilizing Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling11 as the model system. The overarching goal was to develop
a method that utilized the absolute minimum of all reagents necessary.
Initial definition of reaction conditions began with the evaluation
of previously disclosed transformations described by us for sp2 C–sp3 N bond formation via Buchwald–Hartwig
amination (entry 1) without success (Table 1).12 Modest conversion
was realized for reagents from prior Suzuki–Miyaura13 (entry 2) and Sonogashira cross-couplings14 (entry 3) methods previously disclosed by us
for similar substrates. Interested in improving conversion performance,
additional catalyst/ligand combinations were evaluated.

Entries 4–6
with Pd2+ and Pd0 sources,
respectively, did not improve upon entry 2. Combining Pd(OAc)2 with the alkylbiaryl phosphine XPhos, developed by Buchwald,15 afforded 93% conversion after 16 h (entry 7).
Transitioning to Pd(dba)2 (entry 8), as well as the matched tBuXPhos precatalyst (entry 9), afforded 0 and 40% conversion,
respectively. Expansion of ligand diversity to Xantphos16 with a large 108° bite angle to accelerate
reductive elimination, in combination with Pd(dba)2, afforded
99% conversion of the starting material after just 1 h at 115 °C
(entry 10). Minimal Boc deprotection of the product was observed in
this case. Decrease of the base loading to 1 equiv did not result
in the exclusion of Boc deprotection but still maintained excellent
conversion (entry 11). Lowering the temperature to 55 °C in toluene
extended the reaction time (16 h), as expected, but did not improve
the impurity profile of the crude reaction mixture. Improving the
efficiency of the transformation was, subsequently, attempted employing
a solvent screen with ethereal solvents methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) at their
respective boiling points (entries 12 and 13). Entry 12 produced the
cleanest transformation overall, but at lower conversion, whereas
entry 13 afforded high conversion, no Boc deprotection in the proof
of concept example, and a manageable impurity profile affording the
desired product 2 in 73% isolated yield in an expeditious
reaction time of 45 min. Reduction of the catalyst and ligand loading
to 1 and 2%, respectively (entry 14), resulted in longer reaction
time, lower conversion, and a worse impurity profile. The requisite
control experiments were performed to underscore the necessity of
all reagents to afford 2 (entries 15–17). With
a viable procedure for the construction of the critical pyridin-2-yl-indole
C–C bond defined, focus shifted toward the evaluation of the
indole scope of the transformation (Table 2). Experiments were performed to understand
the electronic preferences of the catalyst/ligand system.

and Xantphos (0.019 mmol) utilized.

f 2,6-Dibromopyridine used as the
substrate with described conditions and 2.10 equiv of coupling reagent;
yield over 2 steps.

Treatment
of 1 with the unfunctionalized, indole-boronic
acid resulted in the desired complexant 3 in 78% yield
(entry 1). The weakly electron-donating methyl substituent in 4 afforded the lowest yield (47%) of the indole boron reagent
examples evaluated in Table 2 (entry 2) due, in part, to purification challenges. The method
was tolerant of inductive electron-withdrawing (entries 3 and 4) as
well as resonance-donating substituents (entry 5), on the indole-boronic
acid with the substituent in the 5-position.17 Substituent transposition to the 6-position in the case of resonance-donating
groups afforded the desired products 7 and 8. The success of the transmetallating indole boron species was not
limited to boronic acids. Treatment of 1 with the pinacol
ester indole derivative afforded the desired product 10 in good yield. Employment of this reagent in the context of a double
cross-coupling experiment with 2,6-dibromopyridine (entry 11) was
also successful leading to the formation of 12 in 85%
yield over two steps from 1.18 Exchange of the heteroatom in the boronic acid to the more electron-withdrawing
oxygen atom in the case of entry 10 was successful but afforded 11 in a modest 37% yield.19 It
is also noteworthy that when the boronic acid functional group was
located in the 5-position of the indole, successful coupling was not
realized suggesting that effective transmetallation and/or reductive
elimination of the desired product were predicated on the boronic
acid being present in the 2-position relative to the indole.

Having ascertained that the desired substrates were tolerant of
electronically diverse indole coupling reagents, efforts shifted to
the variation of the electrophile and cross-coupling reagent toward
potentially improving complexant solubility and separations outcomes
in process-relevant diluents (Table 3).

Table 3 highlights
the diversified combination of the substrate and indole-boronic acids.
Interestingly, when a weakly electron-donating substituent is placed
on the electrophile and paired with the same functionality on the
indole-boronic acid (entry 1), a satisfactory coupling outcome (13) is afforded. However, when the same substrate is combined
with an unfunctionalized-Boc-protected indole-boronic acid, a modest
38% yield (14) is afforded. The low yield in the case
of 14 is primarily due to purification issues with this
combination, which proved the most difficult in the entire project.
Combining an electron-withdrawing functionality in the case of a F-substituent
on the substrate with electron-withdrawing (entry 3) and electron-donating
(entry 4) functionalities rendered little difference in the product
formation. Complexants bearing the 3,3′-methoxy substituent
on the 1,2,4-triazinyl moiety have demonstrated acumen in separations
processes.20 Evaluation of this synthon
with the 5-methoxy- (entry 5) and 4-methyl-Boc-protected (entry 8)
indole-boronic acids resulted in similar performance affording 17 and 20 in 61 and 56% isolated yield, respectively.

The study of complexant scaffolds with aliphatic functionality
is an important area of focus for this laboratory. Entries 9–11
with butyl and 3-methylbutyl substituents on the arene moiety of the
electrophile performed similarly with resonance-donating, neutral,
and electron-withdrawing functionalities (22, 23, and 21, respectively). Entries 12 and 13 with the
6-benzyloxy- substituent on the Boc-protected indole-boronic acid
were achievable, but yield issues were experienced in both cases (24 and 25) with two flash purifications on acidic
Al2O3 required to obtain a spectroscopically
clean material from 25.

An issue among Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling methods is
the performance variation of boron reagent within the confines of
a specific catalyst–ligand combination. Diversity of the boron
reagent can lead to substantive deviation in method performance.21 Interested in ascertaining the applicability
of alternative boron reagents with 1,22 evaluations of the boronic acid, pinacol ester, potassium
trifluoroborate, and MIDA23 ester of benzene
were studied (Table 4). Results toward 26 sought to evaluate the performance
differences between transmetallating reagents with 1 and
the current catalyst/ligand system.24

b Percent conversion determined

c Isolated, purified yield.

Phenyl boronic acid (entry 1) afforded the highest conversion in
the shortest period of time but profoundly slower than the comparable
indole-boronic acids suggesting that the presence of the N atom on
the arene had a marked influence in accelerating the rate of transmetallation
or reductive elimination toward product formation. The case of potassium
phenyltrifluoroborate (entry 3) afforded 85% conversion but a poor
isolated yield. It is important to mention that 1 was
successfully coupled and purified with other potassium aryl, and even
alkyltrifluoroborates, in our previous work25 suggesting that this catalytic system is less effective for these
reagents. Entry 3 with the phenyl pinacol ester afforded modest conversion
even though the indole derivative performed well (Table 2, entry 12). Low conversion
in the case of the phenyl MIDA reagent26 was observed (entry 4). In both of the aforementioned cases of low
conversion, it is postulated that protodeboronation of the boron reagent
occurred affording benzene, which, subsequently, boiled off of the
reaction at the temperature performed.

Production of sufficient
quantities of a given complexant scaffold
for full solubility and separation efficacy via scale-up of a development
scale transformation can frequently present challenges. With the aforementioned
in mind, a 10-fold scale-up transformation of 1 to 2 (Table 2,
Entry 5) was executed with equivalent stoichiometry to the development
of scale transformation. Pleasingly, the conversion, purification,
and isolation were commensurate with the development scale affording 2 in a slightly improved 78% yield over the development example
described in Table 1 (Scheme 1).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have disclosed a potent catalytic system for the
construction of tridentate, semifrustrated 2-[6-(5,6-diphenyl-[1,2,4]triazin-3-yl)-pyridin-2-yl]-1H-indole complexants and related derivatives with low catalyst/ligand
loadings, wide substrate scope, and good functional group tolerance.
This work bears relevance to the construction of the challenging pyridin-2-yl
indole C–C bond and should find further applicability in medicinal
chemistry and related areas. Exploration of this class of complexants
for potential application in minor actinide separations as well as
defining experimental conditions for Boc deprotection are currently
ongoing in this laboratory and will be reported in due course.

Experimental
Section
General Considerations
All reagents were purchased
from US chemical suppliers, stored according to published protocols,
and used as received unless indicated otherwise. All experiments were
performed in an oven- or flame-dried glassware. Reaction progress
was monitored using thin-layer chromatography on glass-backed basic
Al2O3 plates and/or 1H NMR analysis
of crude reaction mixtures. Rf values for compounds that resulted in a concentrically observed
spot on basic alumina TLC plates are reported using the conditions
listed. Melting point data listed is for a single, uncorrected experiment
unless noted otherwise. All reported yields listed are for pure compounds
and corrected for the residual solvent, if applicable, from 1H NMR spectroscopy unless otherwise indicated. Infrared spectral
data were acquired using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) from the
(form) listed. All 1H and 13C NMR data were
acquired from a 500 MHz multinuclear spectrometer with a broadband
N2 cryoprobe. Chemical shifts are reported using the δ
scale and are referenced27 to the residual
solvent signal: CDCl3 (δ 7.26), CD3CN
(δ 1.94), (CD3)2C=O (δ 2.05),
CD5CD3 (δ 6.97), and (CD3)2S=O (δ 2.50) for 1H NMR and chloroform
(δ 77.16), CD3CN (δ 1.32), (CD3)2C=O (δ 29.84), CD5CD3 (δ
137.48), and (CD3)2S=O (δ 39.52)
for 13C NMR. Splittings are reported as follows: (s) =
singlet, (d) = doublet, (t) = triplet, (dd) = doublet of doublets,
(dt) = doublet of triplets, (ddd) = doublet of doublet of doublets,
(br) = broad, (br-m) = broad multiplet, and (m) = multiplet. 13C NMR spectra were corrected for ringdown using linear back
prediction. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained
utilizing electron impact ionization (EI) with a magnetic sector (EBE
trisector), double focusing-geometry mass analyzer.

Special Instructions
It should be noted that products
afforded in the context of the described method demonstrate significant
sensitivity to the residual acidity in chloroform and dichloromethane,
even when buffered. Pursuant to the aforementioned, these solvents
should be avoided where possible for the purposes of chromatographic
purification, transfer, and/or NMR analysis. Acetone and acetonitrile
were suitable alternatives for this work. Most products display limited
solubility in methanol. Additionally, prepared materials appear to
readily incorporate the residual solvent into the crystal lattice,
which is challenging to remove via standard reduced pressure techniques.
Azeotropic removal of the residual acetone and/or ethyl acetate with
acetonitrile afforded dry, residual solvent-free compounds at a much
faster rate than freeze, pump, thaw strategies.

3-(6-Bromo-pyridin-2-yl)-5,6-bis-[4-(3-methyl-butyl)-phenyl]-[1,2,4]triazine
An adaptation of a literature protocol was employed.29 To a 25 mL round-bottom flask equipped with
a magnetic stirring bar at ambient temperature was added 6-bromo-pyridine-2-carbonitrile
(0.139 g, 0.76 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (1.11
mL, 8 vol). The resulting clear solution was treated with hydrazine
hydrate-64% hydrazine (0.22 mL, 4.57 mmol, 6 equiv) drop wise at ambient
temperature. The resulting mixture was heated to 40 °C for 12
h upon which time the mixture was cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath
to facilitate precipitation. The solids were isolated under reduced
pressure, and the filter cake was conditioned with hexanes (0 °C)
(3 × 10 mL). The resulting solids were dried under reduced pressure
at ambient temperature, and then telescoped directly to the condensation
step. Stoichiometry for the condensation was based on 100% conversion
of the input. The telescoped solids were slurried in anhydrous THF
(1.30 mL, 8 vol) at ambient temperature and treated with 1,2-bis-[4-(3-methyl-butyl)-phenyl]-ethane-1,2-dione,
prepared as described above, (0.280 g, 0.80 mmol, 1.05 equiv) in one
portion. The resulting mixture was heated to 66 °C for 12 h upon
which time the mixture was cooled to ambient temperature and directly
absorbed onto normal phase silica gel under reduced pressure at ambient
temperature. The crude material was purified using automated flash
column chromatography to afford the title compound. Rf = 0.56, 20% EtOAc:hexanes; eluent,

dibenzylidene acetone (3.45 mg, 0.006 mmol, 0.025 equiv), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene
(XantPhos) (7.52 mg, 0.013 mmol, 0.05 equiv), the required indole-boronic
acid, or analogous coupling reagent (1.05 equiv), and Cs2CO3 (84 mg, 0.258 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The resulting mixture
was slurried in a 4:1 mixture of CPME:H2O (0.86 mL, 0.20
M total) and heated to 106 °C in a vial apparatus for 0.75 h
upon which time the reaction mixture turned from clear to dark brown
and TLC analysis on basic Al2O3 demonstrated
the consumption of starting material. TLC results were, subsequently,
benchmarked by 1H NMR spectroscopy to determine percent
conversions, relevant impurity profile, and support further purification
of the crude material. The crude reaction mixtures were directly absorbed
on celite and purified using automated flash column chromatography
on an acidic alumina stationary phase, with an isocratic mobile phase
consisting of 8% [(3:1-ethyl acetate:acetone):hexanes] to afford the
title compounds in the morphologies indicated. All yields reported
are for pure materials and take into consideration the residual solvent,
if applicable.
