Al2O3 is commonly used in modern electronic
devices because of its good mechanical properties and excellent electrical
insulating property. Although fundamental understanding of the electron
transport in Al2O3 is essential for its use
in electronic device applications, a thorough investigation for the
electron-transport mechanism has not been conducted on the structures
of Al2O3, especially in nanometer-scale electronic
device settings. In this work, electron transport via Al2O3 for two crystallographic facets, (100) and (012), in
a metal–insulator–metal junction configuration is investigated
using a density functional theory-based nonequilibrium Green function
method. First, it is confirmed that the transmission function, T(E), decreases as a function of energy
in (E – EF) <
0 regime, which is an intuitively expected trend. On the other hand,
in the (E – EF) > 0 regime, Al2O3(100) and Al2O3(012) show their own characteristic behaviors of T(E), presenting that major peaks are shifted
toward lower energy levels under a finite bias voltage. Second, the
overall conductance decay rates under zero bias are similar regardless
of the crystallographic orientation, so that the contact interface
seemingly has only a minor contribution to the overall conductance.
A noteworthy feature at the finite bias condition is that the electrical
current drastically increases as a function of bias potential (>0.7
V) in Al2O3(012)-based junction compared with
the Al2O3(100) counterpart. It is elucidated
that such a difference is due to the well-developed eigenchannels
for electron transport in the Al2O3(012)-based
junction. Therefore, it is evidently demonstrated that at finite bias
condition, the contact interface plays a key role in determining insulating
properties of Al2O3–Pt junctions.

1 Introduction
Because
integrated circuits in modern electronics are composed
of lots of nanometer-scale electronic components such as transistors,
capacitors, and resistors on a very small silicon substrate, good
insulation is a critical factor for the reliable operation of the
devices. Metal oxide has been widely used as an insulating material.
In particular, crystalline aluminum oxide (alumina, Al2O3) has been proven as a versatile insulating material
for various applications. First of all, Al2O3 has been used as an effective insulating barrier in capacitor applications,1 which is mainly due to its high resistivity,
stable dielectric strength, relatively high thermal conductivity (k = 30–35 W/mK),2 and
a high-fracture toughness (3.37 MPa m–1/2).3 In addition, Al2O3 has
excellent surface properties suitable for broad range of applications
including a good corrosion resistance to a wide range of chemistries.
For example, hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 shows
catalytic activity for water dissociation.4

Al2O3 has mixed bonding characteristics
composed
of ionic and covalent bonding, a large band gap energy, and concomitantly
low concentration of both ionic defects and electronic carriers.5 These intrinsic characteristics are crucial in
determining various electronic phenomena at the interfaces in device
applications. Two-dimensional MoS2 thin-film growth on
α-Al2O3, for example, shows a considerable
enhancement of charge mobility at the interface. In this case, the
α-Al2O3 substrate is known to suppress
the Coulomb scattering of the charge carriers or changes in phonon
dispersion, which enhances the charge mobility of the device.6,7 It should be noted that, despite the wide use of Al2O3 in diverse research fields, its electronic structure per
se is usually less known than that of pure or mixed metals. The reason
is mostly due to (1) the readily formed defective surface structures
that alter original electronic properties and (2) experimental difficulties
in measuring its electronic transport properties like many other metal
oxides. In that context, we investigate the electron-transport properties
of Al2O3 in two major crystallographic directions
using density functional theory-based nonequilibrium Green function
(DFT-NEGF) method8−12 to achieve fundamental understanding of the electron-transport mechanisms
through the system. Recently, the NEGF coupled DFT methodology has
successfully explored strong orbital overlap and the electron and
phonon scattering to investigate thermoelectric transport at the Al/γ-Al2O3 interface.13 For
the study, we utilize the DFT-NEGF to a model system configured as
metal–insulator–metal (Pt–Al2O3–Pt) to investigate the electron scattering in nanometer-thick
dielectric transport channels at the interfaces in these models, and
thereby, clarify the transport mechanism through the dielectric media
in nanometer scale.

Considering modern electronic device development
often requires
nanometer-scale architectures where understanding atomistic structures
of the materials and their electronic properties become crucial to
accomplish desirable device performance,14 the propagation of electronic state with an entailed electron transport
has attracted lots of interests as a fundamental physical problem
for a long time.15 A challenge in this
problem, however, is that the electron transport in a multiple-component
system takes place via many-body electronic energy states.16−18 Because it has been known that the given single-electron based scattering
theory19 would not be sufficiently accurate,
especially at the interface between electron reservoir and contact
region, a method such as the DFT-NEGF approach can be employed to
accurately describe electron transport via interface by taking into
account the many-body electronic interaction within the self-consistent
framework of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian in the nonequilibrium
state.

In this study, the variation of electronic structure
and corresponding
difference in electron transmission at Pt–Al2O3–Pt junction system are investigated as a function
of bias voltage, using the DFT-NEGF formalism described above. Thereby,
the conductance of the junction systems with two different Al2O3 crystallographic directions, (100) and (012)
in various thicknesses are thoroughly characterized in: (1) zero-bias
limit and (2) finite-bias voltage limit.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Structural Property of
Al2O3
The systems were built using
Al2O3(100) and (012) crystallographic facets
for the contact interface
as shown in Figure 1a. The Al2O3(100) facet has the same surface
morphology with the Al2O3(010) due to crystallographic
symmetry. Thus, the two surfaces such as Al2O3(100) and Al2O3(012), were used to construct
the junction systems, which are denoted by A100 and A012, respectively.
The surface facets were prepared by cleaving the surface along the
crystallographic directions without any atomic defect or dangling
bond. Therefore, aluminum-top or oxygen-top surfaces are generated
in each facet at the contact interface with electrodes. The contact
interfaces between Pt phase and Al2O3 phase
were geometry-optimized to reach stable energy state, where the average
distances between Al and Pt atoms at the surface were ∼1.96
and ∼2.43 Å for A100 and A012, respectively. The atomic
distance difference indicates that the Al2O3(100) surface forms tighter binding with the Pt(111) electrode. Table 1 shows the range of
binding distances between atoms for both A100 and A012. The optimized
Pt–O configuration at the Pt–Al2O3 interface can be formed by unique contact geometries of oxygen atoms
on the interface, such as on-top, hollow, bridge sites (Supporting Information Figure S1a). Individual
contributions to the electronic structure of oxygen atoms at each
site, however, show negligibly small differences as presented at Figure S1b, which is why this study pays attention
to length dependence of the Al2O3 phase to the
electron transport by keeping the contact geometry constant for different
lengths.

shifted by Fermi energy.

2.2 Electron
Transmission
2.2.1 Bias-Dependent Shift
of Major Peak Positions
The DFT-NEGF calculations were performed
for various thicknesses
of the Al2O3 phase (2–6 nm) to obtain
transmission spectra T(E) under
the zero and finite applied bias (Vb)
conditions. Figure 1b compares the transmissions of A100 and A012 in logarithmic scale
as a function of electron energy. The transmission spectra show their
characteristic features under the applied biases. The values of T(E) of both systems are monotonously decreased
in the regime of (E – EF) < 0 for all thickness conditions, while T(E) shows characteristic features depending on the
crystallographic orientation of Al2O3 phases
in the regime of (E – EF) > 0: T(E) of A100 is
relatively
flat compared with that of A012. One noticeable feature observed in Figure 1b is that the major
peak positions are dependent on the Al2O3 phase
orientation (for instance, EF + 1.26 eV
for A100 and EF + 0.84 eV for A012 at Vb = 0 V). Another feature is that the major
peaks are shifted toward EF with increasing Vb (from 0.0 to 1.0 V) by ∼eVb/2 regardless of the thickness. To be more precise, the
major peak at zero-bias condition is split into two parts as Vb is applied, and each split peak corresponds
to each electrode, where one peak is shifted by +Vb/2 = μL – EF and another peak is shifted by −Vb/2 = μR – EF. According to eq 4, only the latter one is affected by the bias window and, consequently,
influences the electrical current. Therefore, the peak shifting downward
is in major concern. Table 2 summarizes the positions of major transmission peaks at each
applied bias, showing that the peak positions are shifted toward lower
energy as the applied bias increases, whereas their relative peak
intensities with respect to that of Fermi level remain nearly constant,
regardless of the thickness variation of Al2O3 phase. Considering both distinct A100 and A012 phases providing
the same degree of major peak shift by eVb/2 that is comparable to the chemical potential shift of the electrode,
it is inferred that the shifted peaks are originated from the contact
part of the Pt–Al2O3 junction, rather
than from the structural difference of crystallographic phases. This
also shows that, in addition to the cross-sectional area and length
dependency of the resistance in macroscopic scale, the contact interface
between electrode (Pt) and material (Al2O3)
becomes an important factor20,21 in nanometer-scale
devices because the dimension of the interface is not ignorable.

2.2.2 Thickness Dependency
T(E) in Figure 1b demonstrates
the thickness dependency of the conductance.
For given Vb values, the T(E) decreases exponentially while the major peak
position remains unchanged even as the Al2O3 becomes thicker. Particularly, it is clear from T(E = EF, Vb = 0 V), which stands for the conductance (G) in the unit of G0 according to eq 6, that the conductance
decreases by around three order of magnitude as the thickness increases
by 1 nm. This indicates that the Al2O3 essentially
acts as a good insulator.

2.3 Conductance
within Zero-Bias Limit
2.3.1 Length Scaling of Conductance
at Zero-Bias
Limit
In order to quantitatively investigate the effect of
the Al2O3 surface facet at the interface with
Pt(111) on the conductance of the system, the thickness dependency
of the zero-bias conductance G = T(E = EF, Vb = 0 V) is analyzed as shown in Figure 2a. The exponential decay of conductance is
observed as a function of the thickness (L), supposing
that the Al2O3 phase is an insulating thin film
sandwiched between two Pt electrodes in the metal–insulator–metal
junction. This means that electrons can penetrate the insulator via
quantum tunneling. Here, the thickness dependency of the electron
tunneling can be characterized using a simplified Simmons equation22,23 for the metal–insulator–metal junction as presented
by 1  where β denotes the
tunneling decay
rate of the conductance with the barrier thickness L, and GC is an effective contact conductance
that can be obtained by extrapolating from the trends down to L = 0, and here, the unit is expressed in terms of G0. Assuming a rectangular potential barrier
of the tunneling junction with the average height of φ, β
is written as24 2  where m is the mass of electron
and h is the Planck constant.

Figure 2 (a) Thickness dependence
of the conductance calculated for A100
(solid line with filled squares) and A012 (dotted line with hollow
triangles) under zero bias limit. Tunneling decay rates are βA100 = 0.78/Å for A100 and βA012 = 0.74/Å
for A012, and the effective contact conductances are GC,100 = 0.243 G0 and GC,012 = 0.0216 G0; local electron density of states of the Pt–Al2O3–Pt junctions for (b) A100 and (c) A012 at L = 2 nm: for both cases, metal induced gap states are observed
only at positions no more than 5 Å away from Pt–Al2O3 interfaces.

The conductance of the junction system, calculated by eq 1, is governed by two factors: (1)
the contact interface between Pt phase and Al2O3 phase and (2) the intrinsic transport properties of Al2O3. The effective contact conductance GC is mainly determined by the characteristics of the contact
interface, for which it is found that GC,100 = 0.0243 G0 and GC,012 = 0.0216 G0 for A100 and
A012, respectively. This comparison of GC indicates that the contact interface of A100 is tighter than that
of A012 at the atomic level, which is consistently confirmed by observing
the shorter bond lengths for Pt–Al and Pt–O as summarized
in Table 1. However,
it should be noted that it provides only a minor contribution to differentiating
the conductance since the difference of GC between A100 and A012 is not significant. This is also presented
in the tunneling decay rate β that depends on the internal atomic
and electronic structure of Al2O3. As shown
in Figure 2a, A100
gives higher decay rate (0.78/Å) than A012 (0.74/Å), which
indicates that Al2O3 provides slightly more
insulation in A100 compared with A012. Based on the contact conductance
and the tunnel decay rate, therefore, Al2O3 demonstrates
a similar insulating property in the junction system, regardless of
the channel length at L < 7 nm as well as the
crystallographic direction.

2.3.2 Insulating
Electronic Structure of Al2O3
To investigate
the detailed electronic
structures of the junction system, the projected density of states
(PDOS) are analyzed as a function of (1) the position in the electron-transport
direction (z) and (2) electron energy (E). Figure 2b,c shows
the PDOS contour of each system with the thickness of 2 nm as an example
which has the highest conductance among the junction systems in this
study. The second Pt layers at the Pt–Al2O3 interface is located at the origin of position axis. From the PDOS
plots, it is observed that the density of states has higher intensity
at 0–5 Å (region I) and 20–25 Å (region II),
indicating that PDOS at the interface (yellow and green) is slightly
stretched out into the Al2O3 phase for both
A100 and A012 systems. In contrast, the Al2O3 phase (dark blue) has very low PDOS between the electrodes. Along
with the zero-bias conductance, which rapidly decreases as the thickness
increases, this PDOS analysis substantiates the excellent insulating
characteristics of the Al2O3, even for such
a thin thickness as 2 nm.

2.3.3 Electronic Structure
Dependence of Transmission
Functions
In Figure 3a,b, the zero-bias transmission spectrum, T(E,0 V) and PDOS for distinct positions (z) along the transport direction in A100 and A012 systems
with 2 nm thickness are compared with each other in order to investigate
the electron-transport mechanisms. As mentioned above, the major peak
at zero-bias locates at E = EP,0V = EF + 1.26 eV and EF + 0.84 eV for A100 and A012 systems, respectively.
By analyzing PDOS as a function of the position in z-axis direction, (i) at the contacting top surface layer of the Al2O3 at Pt–Al2O3 interface
(z = z0 = 1.96 Å
for A100 and 2.25 Å for A012); (ii) at 3 Å above the Al2O3 surface-most layer (z = z0 + 3 Å); (iii) at 8 Å above the Al2O3 surface-most layer with (z = z0 + 8 Å), we find several interesting features.

Figure 3 Transmission
and PDOS features for (a) A100 system and (b) A012
system. It is found that T(E) shows
a high intensity at E = EF + 1.26 eV and E = EF + 0.84 eV for the A100 and A012 systems, respectively. PDOS is also
presented at the marked positions with different z (A, B, and C) shown at (a,b). (c,d) Visualize the LDOS integrated
near the energy states where the peak of T(E) is found for each system, EP,0V – 0.05 eV < E < EP,0V + 0.05 eV, as indicated as green shaded areas in
(a,b).

First, the PDOS has a negligible
contribution to the major transmission
peak at EP,0V = EF + 1.26 eV in A100 system as indicated by arrows in Figure 3a, as the position
in z-axis direction moves into Al2O3 phase (A → B → C). The absence of PDOS peak
means that the A100 system has no dominant hybridized energy state
influencing T(E). On the other hand,
it is found that the major transmission peak for A012 system at EP,0V = EF + 0.84
eV in Figure 3b is
correlated with a residing DOS peak at EP,0V, even up to 8 Å distance from the Al2O3 top surface layer which belongs to the mid position of channel.
From this result, it is inferred that the Pt–Al2O3 hybridization states propagate into Al2O3 phase in the A012 system, which enables a resonant quantum
tunneling through the system.

By integrating the density of
state over the energy range (EP,0V –
0.05 eV < E < EP,0V + 0.05 eV), local density
of states (LDOS) at around the major peak position EP,0V can be visualized in real space as presented in Figure 3c,d for A100 and
A012, respectively. As implied from the PDOS above, the electronic
states are highly localized at the interfacial atoms for A100 system,
whereas the A012 system shows the protruding states toward the Al2O3 phase. This indicates that the strong transmission
peaks at the junctions originate from the electronic hybridizations
at Al2O3–Pt interface. In particular,
atomic arrangement of Al2O3 in A012 system mediates
relatively well-connected DOS features along the transport direction
at the interface with Pt than that in A100 system.

2.4 Conductance within Finite-Bias Condition
2.4.1 I–V Characteristics
For
further understanding of the material
response to applied biases, the current–voltage characteristics
were investigated for A100 and A012 systems using eq 4, especially focusing on the two
smaller thicknesses (L = 2 nm and L = 3 nm). The finite-bias conductance is defined as G = I/Vb, so that G is the slope (ΔI/ΔVb) when the I–V relationship is linear following to eq 5. Previously, T(E) at Figure 1b is
presented as a function of the thickness of the Al2O3 phase in A100 and A012 systems. However, it is clearly revealed
that the A012 system has a stronger bias dependency compared with
A100 system. From both cases, the I–V relationships exhibit the conductance transitions at ∼0.7
V. A100 system with the thickness of 2 nm shows a small change in
conductance with respect to Vb: 4.44 ×
10–12 and 5.76 × 10–12 S
at the low bias (<0.7 V) and high bias (>0.7 V), respectively.
However, it should be noted from Figure 4 that the conductance of the A012 system
undergoes very significant change in comparison to the A100 system.
For the system with L = 2 nm (Figure 4a), the conductance at the low bias region
is GL,012 = 7.95 × 10–12 S, whereas GH,012 = 47.63 × 10–12 S at the high bias region. The same trend is also
found from the system with L = 3 nm in Figure 4b. These observations raise
a question about the transition in electron-transport mechanism in
A012 systems as a function of the applied bias.

Figure 4 I–V characteristics of
the both systems with two different thicknesses: (a) L = 2 nm and (b) L = 3 nm. A012 system demonstrates
a sudden increase of the conductance at higher bias region (>0.7
V),
whereas A100 system shows linear increase of current with nearly a
constant conductance up to 1.0 V.

2.4.2 Transmissions and Eigenchannels
In order
to elucidate the mechanism for the bias-dependent conductance,
we investigate the evolution of major peak of T(E) and the corresponding eigenchannels as a function of
bias voltages. By revisiting bias-dependent transmission functions
for A100 and A012 systems in Figure 5, first, we clarify the direct origin of the conductance
change with respect to the applied bias. At Vb = 0 V in Figure 5a,b, distinct transmission peaks are found at EP,0V = EF + 1.26 eV for the
A100 system and EP,0V = EF + 0.84 eV for the A012 system. When Vb increases to 1.0 V, the transmission peaks shift to
lower energy levels by eVb/2 = 0.5 eV,
so that the peak becomes located at EP,1V ≈ EP,0V – eVb/2 = EF + 0.93 eV for A100
and EF + 0.36 eV for A012. Please note
that the major transmission peak stems from the contact part of the
Pt–Al2O3 junction because the extent
of peak shift (eVb/2) is exactly the same
as that of chemical potential shift (μL/R = EF ± eVb/2)
of the electrode. Considering the integration range (or bias window)
of eq 4 for an applied
bias, μR(=EF – eVb/2) < E < μL(=EF + eVb/2), the major peak in A100 stays outside of the bias window
(EF – 0.5 eV < E < EF + 0.5 eV for Vb = 1.0 V), while that in A012 comes into the integrating
bias range. Estimating from the extent of peak shift, such a peak
of A012 starts involving to electrical current at Vb ≈ 0.7 V, entailing a significant conductance
change from GL,012 to GH,012. In addition to the shift, the T(E) peak intensity of A100 under the zero-bias is
found to diminish down to nearly zero when the bias (Vb = 1.0 V) is applied. However, the peak of A012 is also
weakened but still intense under the bias condition. The presence
of the intense peak from A012 implies that its well-connected electronic
states form solid electron transmission channels under the bias condition,
while such electronic channels are easily disconnected as a result
of external bias in the case of A100.

Figure 5 (a,b) T(E) for each device with
respect to bias voltages, where purple lines indicate the chemical
potentials μL = EF + eVb/2 for left electrode and μR = EF – eVb/2 for right electrode which define the bias window, μR ≈ μL. (c,d) Eigenchannels for the
four energy states (EF, EP,0V, EP,0.5V, and EP,1V). A100 shows no eigenchannels at left electrode
region at EP,1V, while A012 shows well-developed
eigenchannels on both electrode regions and even at the Al2O3 phase region at EP,1V.

Therefore, in order to understand such electron
transmission channels
at various applied bias, eigenchannel for each system is analyzed.
Please note that the eigenchannel is a set of particular scattering
states with a well-defined transmission probability, which is calculated
using the NEGF approach.25Figure 5c,d presents the eigenchannels
for three different energy levels: EF at
zero-bias, EP,0V, EP,0.5V, and EP,1V. As the bias
voltage is increased, the connectivity of eigenchannel is gradually
weakened. It is observed that there is a finite disconnection of eigenchannels
for the electron transmission at EF within
zero-bias condition. However, there is a striking difference in the
distribution of the eigenchannels between A100 and A012 systems. At
zero-bias condition, the strong transmission peak at EP,0V is observed due to a well-connected eigenchannel
throughout the device for both systems, while at the bias of 1 V,
the overall features of eigenchannel at EP,1V are greatly different from those at EP,0V. The eigenchannels of the A100 system are not found at the left
electrode region at the bias of 1 V, which means that the scattering
states contributing to electron transmission at the peak in equilibrium
are now disconnected from the electrodes as the bias is applied. On
the contrary, A012 system shows well-established eigenchannels throughout
both electrode regions and even in Al2O3 phase
at the peak position within the bias. It explains the different trend
in major T(E) peak evolution with
respect to bias voltages, where the peak diminishes for A100 system
but remains intense for A012 system under a finite applied bias.

3 Conclusions
In this study, the electron-transport
characteristics of the Al2O3 phase in a few
nanometer thickness is investigated
using the DFT-NEGF method. In the Pt–Al2O3–Pt junction configuration, two different crystallographic
orientations of the Al2O3 phase such as Al2O3(100) and Al2O3(012) are
selected to scrutinize the orientation-dependency of the electron
transport, which are denoted as A100 and A012, respectively.

The transmission spectra T(E)
are calculated for various thicknesses of the Al2O3 phase. At (E – EF) < 0, T(E) is monotonously
decreased for both systems, while at (E – EF) > 0, A100 and A012 have their own characteristic
behavior of T(E). It was found that
each A100 and A012 has the major T(E) peak at EF + 1.26 eV and EF + 0.84 eV, respectively, under zero-bias condition,
while such major peaks are shifted toward a lower energy level under
a finite applied bias. By analyzing the conductance decay rate from T(E), it is found that the overall conductance
decay rates are similar to each other under zero-bias condition, regardless
of the crystallographic orientation. Although A100 has a tighter contact
interface between the Pt phase and Al2O3 phase,
it has only a minor contribution to the overall conductance.

Even though both systems show distinctive electron transmission
spectra, they have a similar thickness dependency in the conductance
whose magnitude is decreased by around 3 orders of magnitude with
respect to 1 nm the thickness increase of Al2O3 phase. Electron transmission spectrum also changes as a function
of applied bias such that the major peaks in those transmission spectra
are shifted toward lower energy level as the applied bias is increased.
A noteworthy feature from the I–V characteristics induced by the spectral shift is that the A012 system
shows a significant change in conductance at 0.7 V in comparison with
A100. For instance, the conductance of A012 is jumped at 0.7 V from
7.95 × 10–12 S at low bias region (0.1–0.7
V) to 47.63 × 10–12 S for high bias range (0.7–1.0
V), whereas that of A100 is just slightly increased from 4.44 ×
10–12 to 5.76 × 10–12 S at
0.7 V. The fundamental reason for such drastic change is elucidated
using the eigenchannels analysis, demonstrating that the eigenchannels
for electron transmission were developed better throughout the A012
compared to the A100, which enhanced the conductance in nanoscale.
This feature strongly presents that, unlike what we have observed
from zero-bias limit, the contact interface plays an important role
in nonequilibrium electronic transport within finite bias condition.
We expect that this work will shed a light on the critical role of
nanoscale contact in understanding and designing the behavior of nanometer-scale
junction devices.

4 Modeling and Computational
Details
The crystalline Al2O3 phase
has a space group
of R3c, presenting electrically
insulating property. Although it has been expected in general that
the crystalline Al2O3 phase holds such insulating
property even in a few nanometer thickness, the electron transport
via the electronic structures of Al2O3 with
a few nanometer thickness has not been thoroughly studied. Thus, in
order to achieve its fundamental understanding, surface-cleaved Al2O3 systems are systematically modeled with various
thicknesses ranging from 2 to 6 nm in the metal–insulator–metal
configuration as shown in Figure 1a. In the systems, the two regions are defined: (i)
left and right electrode regions configured by crystalline Pt phase
and (ii) central scattering region configured by the insulating Al2O3. Pt(111) is modeled as an electrode surface
with six layers. The dimension of the systems are 4.76 Å ×
12.99 Å × 12.83 Å and 4.81 Å × 5.37 Å
× 14.13 Å to accommodate Al2O3(100)
and Al2O3(012), respectively. A noteworthy point
is that the crystalline phase of Al2O3 has relatively
large band gap of ∼4.3 eV while the amorphous phase has a smaller
band gap of ∼3.2 eV,26 meaning that
the crystalline phase of Al2O3 is more advantageous
for better insulating property in integrated circuit devices.

All calculations are performed using generalized gradient approximation
(GGA) Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional27 with norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe the electron–ion
interactions.28 Double-ζ-polarization-quality
numerical atomic orbital basis set optimized for corresponding GGA
pseudopotentials is employed.29−31 A single k point shifted off
from Γ point is sampled normal to the electrode-surface direction,
so that the Brillouin zone is sampled with 5 × 5 × 1 and
6 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point
mesh with spin polarization for the electronic density of states and
local charge density distribution, respectively, for both configurations.

We use TranSIESTA code8 for NEGF calculations
and TBtrans for the transmission function calculations and current–voltage
(I–V) characteristics. In
the DFT-NEGF method, a transmission function T(E) is expressed in terms of a single Green function and
spectral density function, which describes the coupling between device
components9 3  where Γ and G are
a spectral density
function and a Green function, respectively, and Vb is the bias voltage. Using the transmission function
of eq 3, the steady-state
electronic current is calculated on the basis of Landauer–Büttiker
formula9 by employing the Fermi–Dirac
distributions on both electrodes and the corresponding transmission
function, as follows 4  where h is the Planck’s
constant and f is the Fermi–Dirac distribution
function. Bias voltage Vb is defined as
(μL – μR)/e, and μL/R is the electrochemical potential of left/right
electrode. In symmetric junctions, μL/R = EF ± eVb/2 where EF is the Fermi energy level of the system. Thus,
the Fermi–Dirac distribution function is given as f = 1/[1 + exp(E – EF)/kT], and it can be rewritten with respect
to left/right electrode as fL/R(E) = 1/[1 + exp(E – μL/R)/kT]. For the current, I(Vb), linearly depending on applied finite
bias Vb, the conductance is simply defined
as the slope of I–V relation 5  Here, please note that, in the limit of zero-bias
(Vb ≈ 0 V) and zero-temperature
(T ≈ 0 K), the conductance in Landauer formalism
is given by32,33 6  where G0 = 2e2/h = 7.75 × 10–5 S is defined as the quantum conductance. Therefore, T(EF) simply stands for the conductance G in the unit of G0 at the condition
of zero-bias and zero-T limits.

In this study,
the transmission is normalized by the contact surface
area for direct comparison between two insulating surfaces. To calculate
surface Green functions for each electrode, we perform DFT calculations
using 30 k-points for the calculation of scattering
states along the surface-normal direction of Pt(111) surface, which
provides highly converged transmission data. Considering the conductance
data, we focus on the low-voltage coherent tunneling limit, for which
the usual adiabatic approximation can be invoked and the coupling
between the charge transport and the molecular vibration is negligible.
