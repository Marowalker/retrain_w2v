Camphor-based mono-/bilayer graphene
(MLG) sheets have been synthesized
by very facile atmospheric chemical vapor deposition processes on
Si/SiO2, soda lime glass, and flexible polyethylene terephthalate
films. The effect of camphor concentration with respect to distance
between camphor and the Cu foil (D) has been varied
to investigate the controlled formation of a homogeneous graphene
sheet over a large area on Cu foil. Raman studies show a remarkable
effect of camphor at a typical distance (D) to form
a monolayer to multilayer graphene (MULG) sheet. The signature of
MLG to MULG sheets appears due to increase in the number of nucleation
sites, even over the subsequent domains that contribute stacks of
graphene over each other as observed by high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy images. Moreover, the increase in camphor concentration
at a particular distance generates more defect states in graphene
as denoted by D band at 1360 cm–1. Uniform distribution
of large-area MLG demonstrates an intense 2D/G ratio of ∼2.3.
Electrical and optical measurements show a sheet resistance of ∼1
kΩ/sq with a maximum transmittance of ∼88% at 550 nm
for low camphor concentration. An improvement in the rectification
and photodiode behavior is observed from the diodes fabricated on
n-Si/MULG as compared to n-Si/MLG in dark and light conditions.

1 Introduction
Since the invention of
graphene in 2004, it has attracted a great
attention because of its extraordinary quantum transport, optical
transmittance, superior mobility, thermal conductivity, and superior
mechanical properties. A honeycomb lattice arrangement consists of
a long chain of carbon atoms in sp2 hybridization, enabling
its use in optoelectronic applications such as transparent conducting
electrodes, solar cells, photodetectors, and field-effect transistors.1−4 All these high-accuracy and large-scalable optical devices demand
graphene films with very high quality and large domain size on a larger
area. Motivated by all these superior properties, different processes
are currently under development to achieve mono-/bilayer graphene
(MLG) sheets over a larger area to attain a low sheet resistance and
high transmittance values.5,6 Among all the synthesis
processes established so far, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
process has been considered as one of the most versatile technique
to synthesize large-area graphene with controllable layer numbers
and single crystal domains. In this technique, the carbon precursors
are decomposed on the Cu surfaces because of its low carbon solubility
and the self-limiting factor.6−10 The resulting graphene on the metal substrate can be easily transferred
to any desirable substrates by a simple transferring process without
affecting much of the properties of graphene. Recently, gaseous hydrocarbons
and liquid carbon sources have been replaced by forthcoming solid
carbon sources such as camphor (C10H16O), polystyrene,
and so forth by a very facile and low cost approach to achieve a large-area
MLG on Cu foil with an optimum optoelectronic properties.11−15 Kalita et al. have initiated the growth of mono-/bilayer graphene
by employing camphor as a carbon source on different metal substrates.14−18

In recent years, significant efforts have been made to synthesize
large single crystal MLG sheets from camphor on Cu foil to form a
large area by the atmospheric chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) process.
However, there are various factors that have affected the graphene
nucleation and growth on the Cu surface grown by APCVD, such as gas
composition, growth temperature, flow rate of carbon source, and substrate
surface purity.15,16,19−22 There are various reports on the variation of annealing and gaseous
flow rates to control the nucleation and growth kinetics of graphene
crystals on substrate surfaces.10,23−26 In addition, various temperature conditions give an indication on
the control formation of monolayer, bilayer, hexagonal structure,
layer-stacking, and dendrite growth of graphene.27,28 In this regard, the key point for the present investigation is to
achieve MLG on Cu foil with a large domain size that can deliver good
optical and electrical properties. An efficient, low-cost, and facile
approach of using camphor as a carbon precursor has been utilized
to develop an MLG sheet with a large domain size on a Cu foil and
transfer it to glass and flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
substrates. The nucleation and growth mechanism to optimize an MLG
has been further explained in detail by varying the concentration
of camphor at various source-to-substrate distances (D). Finally, superior optical and electrical properties have been
identified in correlation with the growth mechanism for various camphor
concentrations.

2 Results and Discussion
The synthesis and formation of large-area graphene sheets (∼1
cm × 1.5 cm) were performed using camphor, a botanical hydrocarbon
source, by pyrolysis in a high-temperature atmospheric CVD system.
Camphor is a natural solid, low-cost, and environmental friendly hydrocarbon.
It consists of hexagonal and pentagonal rings along with a methyl
carbon structure, which plays an important role in graphene formation
as shown schematically in Figure 1. During pyrolysis, methyl carbon can be easily detached
and hexagonal carbon ring can be fused to form a larger graphene sheet
on Cu foil. During the growth process, at a certain distance (D) and evaporation temperature, Te = ∼350–400 °C, transformation of solid camphor
to camphor vapor phase takes place, and under the Ar/H2 flow, the camphor molecules are transported to Cu foil as schematically
shown in Figure 2.
It is to be noted that the graphene nucleation from camphor vapor
on a Cu foil is a surface reaction mechanism, as demonstrated in the
synthesis of methane-based graphene by Li et al.21 Catalytic decomposition of camphor to carbon atoms on a
Cu foil takes place at a very high temperature of 1020 °C. By
optimizing the camphor concentration, a continuous formation of single-chain
hexagonal rings of carbon atoms creates an MLG on a large surface
and bilayer growth at a few regions on the Cu substrate. In order
to understand the effect of camphor concentration to form of an MLG,
the source to substrate distance was varied and kept at 15, 16, and
17.5 cm. For each distance (D), the camphor concentration
was varied from 1 to 5 mg. Figure 3 shows the evaporation rate (mg/min) (Re) of camphor at the above-mentioned distances to form
a homogenous and uniform graphene sheet. As the camphor concentration
increases from 1 to 5 mg, the Re linearly
decreases for a particular distance due to an increase in the camphor
weight as seen in Figure 3a–c. The observations can be expressed in terms of
camphor weight (Wc), as follows 1

temperature (T = 1020 °C) under the Ar/H2 mixture by using the APCVD technique. The magnified image

after annealing treatment.

(d) Schematic showing inhomogeneous to homogenous and continuous growth

It is observed that a very low camphor concentration
is not sufficient
and appropriate for covering a homogeneous graphene sheet on Cu foil.
Therefore, further experiments were carried out by considering 3,
4, and 5 mg of camphor at 16 and 17.5 cm distances. Figure 3d provides an easy understanding
on the transition of inhomogeneous to homogeneous and uniform growth
of graphene with respect to camphor concentration. To further understand
the effect of camphor on the formation of homogeneous MLG sheets,
we have carried out optical microscopy and micro Raman spectroscopy
studies for all the above-mentioned parameters which will be discussed
in the subsequent sections.

Optical microscopic studies have
been carried out to explore and
elucidate the nucleation, growth, and morphology of the homogenous
graphene sheet for various camphor concentrations as shown in Figure 4A. To clearly visualize
the graphene crystals with an optical microscope, selective oxidation
of the Cu surface was performed by annealing at 180 °C for 5
min in atmospheric conditions. Low-temperature oxidation does not
change pristine quality of graphene but changes Cu foil to copper
oxide and leads to visible graphene domain due to color contrast.
Initially, for low camphor concentration of 1 and 2 mg at D = 15 cm, most of the portion is uncovered by graphene
as highlighted by domain (a) and in some of the portion, a presence
of hexagonal growth of graphene crystals over a Cu foil can be observed
and it is highlighted in domain (b). Further increasing the camphor
concentration to 3 mg, most of the part is covered by graphene crystals
except few. For 3.5 mg, it is found that there is no uncovered domain
left by the graphene. Nevertheless, in most of the regions, there
are low nucleation sites of graphene, which are distinguished and
highlighted as domain (c). In addition, there are some regions at
this particular concentration where we found homogeneous nucleation
of graphene, where merging of the crystals to form larger clusters
has been verified and highlighted as domain (d). Again increasing
the concentration to 4 and 5 mg leads to increase in the number density
of nucleation sites even over graphene domains and hence a possibility
of forming a homogeneous growth of few layers of graphene on Cu foil.
In this regard, micro Raman measurements as shown in Figure 4B were carried out on Cu foil
to identify the crystalline nature, number of layers, and defects
states of graphene for various camphor concentrations with the utilization
of 1% of the total laser power for 30 s of exposure time. Raman spectra
were taken at different locations in an as-grown graphene sheet. For
very low camphor concentrations, the spectra were taken at a spot
where graphene crystals are easily distinguished [see Figure 4A highlighted as (b)]. Raman
spectra show almost no defect-induced D band at ∼1360 cm–1 at the particular spot, presenting a high quality
of graphene crystals. Moreover, there is presence of a characteristic
graphitic G and second-order 2D Raman peak at ∼1590 and ∼2700
cm–1, respectively. It is well reported in the literature
that the 2D peak position experiences a blue shift with increasing
number of graphene layers, providing a signature of multilayer graphene
(MULG), which is observed in our present investigation as well.13,31,32 This may be due to an increase
in the number of nucleation sites of graphene crystals which can form
stacks of graphene layers. This effect introduced more defect states
described as D band at ∼1360 cm–1 for high
camphor concentration. Also, with the increase in the number of layers
due to increase in the camphor concentration, the 2D band experiences
a significant broadening due to enhancement of the allowed double
resonance processes as a result of the splitting of both the in-plane
transverse optical phonon and electronic branches.16,17,31 Similarly, the Raman spectra were carried
out to study the overall effect of camphor concentration by varying D = 16 cm (Figure 5a) and 17.5 cm (Figure 5b). It has been observed that, the growth is more uniform
and homogenous for D = 16 cm, which is confirmed
by taking Raman results at various spotted areas. Eventually, as discussed
above, as the camphor concentration increases to 3.5 mg and more,
the defect-induced D band increases due to more number of graphene
layers. On the other hand, 2D band shows a more intense peak for low
camphor concentration (3.5 mg). It has been observed that 2D band
is much more intense than that of the G band, which indicates a monolayer
graphene. It is to be noted that at most of the places, we found a
single-layer graphene, but at some places a possibility of bilayer
graphene has been confirmed. On the other hand, the intensity has
found to be reduced with a significant broadening of 2D band, which
is in agreement with an increase in the number of graphene layers
as the camphor concentration increases above 3.5 mg. As it is evident
from Figure 5a, the
2D/G ratio for the MLG sheet is found to be 2.3, which suggests a
single layer of the graphene sheet with the corresponding full width
at half-maximum of 2D peak to be 24 cm–1. Interestingly,
as we increase the distance to 17 cm, there is no defect-induced D
peak observed as the camphor concentration increases, as observed
for the previous two distances. Carbon radicals have to travel more
distance to nucleate themselves over a Cu foil and may certainly not
be able to grow homogeneously at high camphor concentration. The presence
of the broadening of 2D band is mostly observed, which indicates the
existence of more number of layers above 3 mg. Our observations suggest
that one needs to optimize the growth rate, distances, and camphor
concentrations to identify the best possible nucleation to achieve
a homogeneous and uniform MLG. Therefore, the results clearly show
that control of camphor vapor flowing to the high-temperature furnace
at a particular distance can produce graphene with different number
of layers.

Figure 6 shows field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of graphene sheets
grown for 3.5 and 5 mg concentration of camphor kept at 16 cm distance.
The surface morphological images for the above two cases have been
determined by transferring the graphene sheet on Si/SiO2 substrates. Interestingly, graphene sheets have been homogenously
covered over a large area for the above-mentioned parameters. Moreover,
there is a formation of graphene wrinkles, which can be easily distinguished
and also gives an indication on the formation of graphene, as seen
in Figure 6a,b.14,15,20,22,24 A few wrinkles has been observed for low
camphor concentration of 3.5 mg due to mono-/bilayer formation, whereas
more number of graphene wrinkles for higher concentration (5 mg) have
been determined with a dense morphology because of the formation of
MULG. In order to quantify the FESEM images and Raman observations,
the topographic images of the as-grown graphene sheets were evaluated
by atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis. Figure 7 shows the surface topographic images of
graphene sheets for 3.5 and 5 mg of camphor concentration at D = 16 cm. From AFM images, the root mean square roughness
(Rrms) has been determined in a selected
region for mono-/bi layer (3.5 mg) and MULG (5 mg) and it is found
to be 1.07 and 1.17 nm, respectively, which is identical with the
earlier reported literature.12,24,33,34 In addition, from Figure 7a,b, it is also confirmed that
there is an existence of a few wrinkles on the surface of graphene
grown at low camphor concentration (3.5 mg), but more on the surface
of graphene grown at higher concentration (5 mg). Further, the selected
line scan profiles (indicated by red and blue colors) as shown on
the right hand side of Figure 7a,b have been extracted to exactly determine the change in
surface roughness over the graphene wrinkles for the above two concentrations.
The significant increment in the surface roughness has been observed
when the line passes through wrinkles for a high concentration of
camphor as compared to lower concentration, due to more number of
graphene layers that fold back on the as-deposited surfaces.

On the right of (a,b), a line scanning profile has been shown for
two different regions as indicated by blue and red. The regions indicated
with blue color are without graphene wrinkles and the regions with
red color are with graphene wrinkles.

Figure 8 presents
the transmittance spectra of graphene sheets transferred on glass
and flexible PET substrates for different camphor concentrations at
15, 16, and 17.5 cm. Figure 8a–c shows the transmittance spectra for graphene transferred
on PET films. The maximum transmittance values were found to be 83.6,
84.4, and 86.2% at 550 nm for D = 15, 16, and 17.5
cm, respectively. In addition, the transmittance spectrum for graphene
grown on glass substrates also shows a similar behavior to that of
PET substrates. The high transmittance values at 550 nm were achieved
for 3 mg camphor and they were found to be 88.4, 86.1, and 85.5% for
15, 16, and 17.5 cm, respectively. The results obtained for flexible
PET and glass substrates show improved optical characteristics with
a better quality of graphene sheets as compared to the earlier reports
on camphor.16,17 The results thus indicate that
low camphor concentration with 16 cm distance can give better transparent
sheets as compared to other variations. Moreover, a good transparency
can be correlated with an MLG sheet as confirmed by Raman spectra
(see Figure 5a). The
insets of Figure 8b,e
demonstrate an optical image for graphene transferred on the PET substrate
and on glass substrates, which clearly indicates a very high transparency
of the graphene sheet for low camphor concentration. It is evident
that the transmittance has a direct correlation with the sheet resistance
for graphene sheets.14,17 Therefore, we have also evaluated
the sheet resistance and mobility for various sets of graphene samples. Table 1 displays a sheet
resistance and mobility of the transferred graphene samples for various
camphor concentrations at a typical distance D. We
have found that sheet resistance values are nearly 1–2 kΩ/□
for low camphor concentrations in most of the cases. Moreover, we
have also observed that there is a batch-to-batch variations in graphene
defect density and the accuracy of surface cleanliness, which may
result in such a change in the sheet resistance values. In addition,
there is a highly nonlinear behavior in the sheet resistance values
as the transmittance decreases for various camphor concentrations.
The MLG sheet with 85.4% transmittance has a sheet resistance of Rs = 1.02 kΩ/□, which is still toward
a high sheet resistance for a successful optoelectronic applications
with a high mobility of μb = 1.2 × 103 cm2/V·s.16 This
may be attributed to 1D defective structures of graphene that block
the charge transport in graphene and significantly increase the sheet
resistance to a higher value.

The chemical
states of the MLG sheet have been determined by the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique as shown in Figure 9. The core-level
peak of the C 1s shown in Figure 9 is divided into three major components corresponding
to carbon atoms at different chemical environments. The convoluted
peak consists of two broad peaks at binding energies 284.7 and 285.2
eV. The sharp peak at binding energy 284.7 eV represents graphitic
carbon, that is, sp2 hybridized,35−37 while the characteristic
feature attributed to the presence of defects states, that is, sp3 hybridized, is observed at 285.2 eV.13 The break in the ring of resonating aromatic carbon bonds as schematically
shown maybe the additional reason for the existence of such a broad
defect peak in the sample. Moreover, the oxidized states of carbon
(Cox) are also observed at 288.3 eV. Thus, the occurrence
of more number of defect states in the aromatic chain of carbon bonds
can also be the possible reason for such high sheet resistance values
for graphene samples. Moreover, Figure 10 presents the high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of graphene samples grown at camphor
concentrations of 3 and 5 mg in order to identify the number of layers
to support the Raman observations. A low magnification image as shown
in Figure 10a,d indicates
that the graphene has been successfully transferred on the TEM grid.
The edge of the graphene film folds back, allowing us to identify
the cross-sectional view of the graphene sheet. Figure 10b confirms two to three layers
of graphene for low concentration of camphor as highlighted in the
red circle at few places, whereas another region contributes to the
MLG sheet as demonstrated in Figure 10c. In contrast, Figure 10e indicates that high concentration of camphor
will lead us to more than 10 layers of the graphene sheet. From the
observations, the interplanar spacing of 0.38 nm for MULG was estimated,
which is exactly similar with the existing literature.14,25,29,38 The zoomed-in image of Figure 10e indicates the detailed atomic arrangement of the
graphene sheet. The image indicates hexagonal, pentagonal rings of
carbon atoms for various arrangements of lattice structures to form
a graphene sheet. A more unstable form of graphene (i.e., pentagonal
arrangement) structure at the expense of stable hexagonal ring patterns
at few places may contribute as an initial stage to initiate a defect
into the graphene structure. This atomic defect may lead to the termination
of the interconnecting ring patterns and affect the sheet resistance
of as-grown graphene sheets.

layers of graphene.

MLG/MULG is directly transferred
on a thermally oxide SiO2 (T = 300 nm)-coated
Si substrate to study the electrical
performance of the device. The inset of Figure 11a shows a scheme of a fabricated n-Si/Gr
device with Ag as the contact electrode on both the sides.18 The Ag electrode makes an ohmic contact to the
graphene, while the n-Si/Gr interface forms a Schottky barrier. The
typical dark J–V characteristic
of the Gr/n-Si heterojunction device is shown in Figure 11a. Excellent rectification
behavior is observed for the fabricated device. It is observed that
the JSC value increases exponentially
for the Si/MULG structure as compared to Si/MLG, due to more number
of graphene layers and a very high mobility of MULG obtained by 5
mg camphor as displayed in Table 1.2,4,18,39 It is to be noted that the fabricated device
made from camphor-based graphene is rather novel, which has been reported
for the first time in our present article. When the device is illuminated
under AM 1.5 condition, it shows an excellent rectification and photovoltaic
performance. The enhancement in the JSC values from 0.16 to 11 μA/cm2 signifies more number
of graphene layers that can help to contribute more current.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we present a study to explain
the effect of camphor
concentration along with the source position for achieving a homogenous
island growth of MLG sheets using natural camphor by the very facile
APCVD technique. The Raman study confirms the existence of intense
2D band at ∼2700 cm–1 and G band at 1590
cm–1 for the slow growth process at the rate of
∼20 mg/min with 3.5 mg camphor kept at 16 cm. The existence
of mono-/bilayer and multilayer formation of homogeneous graphene
sheets has been confirmed by HRTEM images. Moreover, the XPS study
confirms the defect peak generated at 285.2 eV, which gives the direct
evidence of such a high sheet resistance value. Synthesized graphene
sheets at various camphor concentrations at typical distances were
transferred onto glass and flexible PET substrates to identify the
optimum electrical and optical properties. The measurement shows a
decent sheet resistance value of ∼1 kΩ/sq with a maximum
transmittance of ∼88% at 550 nm for low camphor concentration.
The excellent rectification and Schottky behavior of n-Si/Gr signifies
that graphene layers contribute to an excellent enhancement in the
current up to 11 μA/cm2. This novel approach of obtaining
a large-area MLG sheet by natural botanical camphor can be easily
scalable for various optoelectronic applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Substrate Preparation
Copper foil
(13382; 25 μm) from Alfa Aaser, USA was used as a metal substrate
for the graphene growth. First, the Cu foil of 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm
was precleaned by acetone and deionized (DI) water and then immersed
in 2:1 DI H2O/HCl at room temperature for 15 min. Then,
the Cu foil was rinsed with DI water three times and then washed with
isopropanol (IPA). Cu foils were then dried under the slow stream
of Ar gas before loading into a high-temperature zone furnace. In
the CVD chamber, first, the Cu substrate was pre-annealed until the
temperature reaches 1020 °C, as represented in Figure 12. Then, Cu foil was annealed
at a constant temperature (1020 °C) for 15 min under an H2 (100 sccm) atmosphere to enlarge Cu grain size and reduce
lattice mismatch and dislocations that help to limit the number of
nucleation sites. During the growth process, the camphor was introduced
and kept at a certain distance for nucleation and growth process under
[Ar/H2] [98:2] mixture. Finally, under the cooling process,
the gas composition was kept constant.

of pre-annealing, annealing, growth, and cooling
processes for various source-to-substrate distances (D) at different camphor concentrations (mg).

4.2 Graphene Growth and Transfer Process
For the graphene
growth process, a quartz tube with length around
1250 mm and diameter 55 mm is used as a CVD reactor and kept horizontally
inside the high-temperature zone furnace as shown schematically in Figure 1. For the synthesis
of graphene, as-cleaned Cu foils were kept with an angle of 10–15°
inside the high-temperature zone facing toward the gas flow and the
carbon source material (camphor) was put in a quartz boat at a typical
distance (D). In our present work, Cu foil inclination
predominantly supports the uniform growth of graphene coverage over
a large substrate as compared to no inclination. In these experiments,
the concentration of camphor and the distance between source and the
substrates (D) were varied to obtain MLG sheets on
glass and PET substrates with suitable electrical and optical properties.
The Cu foil was heated from room temperature to 1020 °C at a
heating rate of ∼15 °C/min under the flow of 200 sccm
high purity Ar, followed by annealing for 15 min under the flow of
100 sccm H2. Then, camphor is moved with a magnet and kept
at a typical distance (D) to evaporate above its
melting point under Ar/H2 as the carrier gas. For the growth
of graphene, the gas composition was changed to Ar/H2 98:2
ratio. The total growth time [evaporation rate (Re)] was calculated accordingly, for all the experimental
variations. After growth, the operation was switched off and the chamber
was allowed to cool naturally under the flow of Ar and H2 gases.

The graphene-covered Cu was coated with polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA) by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 60 s and 1000
rpm for 60 s, followed by baking of PMMA/graphene/copper at 180 °C
for 2 min. Then, the copper was etched by placing the samples over
0.5 M (NH4)2S2O8 for 6
h. The graphene grown on the back side of the Cu was removed by washing
under the stream of DI water and placed again on the etching solution.
The PMMA/graphene was repeatedly cleaned in DI water for five to six
times. Then, the PMMA/graphene was transferred onto the glass, flexible
PET, or SiO2/Si substrates. The substrates were kept overnight
for the complete adhesion to the substrate. Finally, the PMMA layer
was removed by dipping in acetone for 30 min and after that repeatedly
washed with DI water and IPA.

5 Characterization
Details
To identify the formation of MLG, Raman measurements
were carried
out at various spots by using a 532 nm laser source with a micro Raman
(inVia, Renishaw, UK) with an attached optical microscope (Leica Microsystems).
The laser power used was 2.5 mW, with an accumulation time of 30 s.
The sheet resistance and mobility of all the variations were measured
using a Hall Effect measurement system (Ecopia, model HMS-5000) with
the van der Pauw configuration. Optical transmittance of the graphene
sheet was measured using a (UV-2600, Shimadzu) UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The optical measurements were carried out on graphene transferred
onto glass and flexible PET substrates. FE-SEM analysis was carried
out using a (Zeiss, Ultra-55) microscope at 5.0 kV acceleration voltage.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements for one of the graphene
transferred on Si samples were performed in multiprobe surface analysis
(Scienta Omicron, Germany) using the monochromatized Al Kα (1486.7
eV) radiation source. The pass energy of the scans was kept at 20
eV with an ultimate spectral resolution of ∼0.02 eV. The transmission
electron microscopic analysis (JEOL 2100) was conducted at 200 keV
with a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm. Graphene samples were
successfully transferred on the carbon-coated Cu grid by the standard
transfer method process.29,30 AFM analysis was performed
to analyze the air/Si surface roughness interface by using Bruker
MultiMode 8.0, nanoscope ScanAsyst mode (using PeakForce Tapping mechanism).
The device characterization was measured under a solar simulator (SS80AAA,
Photoemission Tech., USA) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter and a source
measuring unit (U2722A, Agilent) by applying the bias of −1
to +1 V.
