Perfluorinated
compounds (PFCs) are emerging persistent environmental
contaminants that may be toxic to animals and humans. To gain fundamental
insights into the mechanism of their toxicity, the interactions of
phosphocholine (PC) liposomes as model membranes were studied with
three types of PFCs, including perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane
sulfonate, and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid potassium salt, together
with three common surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB), and sodium 1-heptanesulfonate (SHS). The interactions
were systematically characterized by zeta potential measurement, dynamic
light scattering, negative-stain transmission electron microscopy,
and fluorescence spectroscopy. Unmodified liposomes, calcein-loaded
liposomes, and Laurdan dye-embedded liposomes were all tested. By
gradually increasing the temperature, the three PFCs and SHS decreased
the leakage of calcein-loaded 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
liposomes, whereas SDS and CTAB increased the leakage. The PFCs that
affected the lipid membranes stronger than SHS were attributable to
their perfluoroalkyl carbon chains. Packing of the lipids was further
studied using Laurdan dye as a probe. Calcein leakage tests also indicated
that PFCs inhibited lipid membrane leakage induced by inorganic nanoparticles
such as silica and gold nanoparticles. This study confirmed the similar
effect of the PFCs as cholesterol in affecting membrane properties
and would be helpful for understanding the interaction mechanism of
PFCs and cell membranes.

Introduction
Perfluorinated compounds
(PFCs) or perfluoroalkyl substances are
a class of molecules with each hydrogen atom on alkyl chains replaced
by fluorine.1 They encompass a diverse
range of chemicals that are produced in large quantities for various
technical applications such as fire extinguishing media and electroplating
baths, preparation of fluoropolymers, and consumer products.2,3 Because of their widespread use and nonbiodegradability, PFCs have
been detected in both the aquatic environment and biological tissues.4−8 These emerging pollutants in turn result in adverse effects to the
environment and human health.9−11

The most commonly seen
PFCs contain six to ten saturated carbons
with full fluorine substitution and terminated with a carboxyl or
sulfonate headgroup, which make them interesting surfactants.12 Compared to typical surfactants with hydrocarbon
tails, PFCs have even more hydrophobic perfluoroalkyl carbon chains.
The fluorine atom on the carbon chain has a partial negative charge
because of its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. Therefore,
in addition to the anionic headgroups, these carbon chains also contribute
to its overall negative charges.13 Furthermore,
PFCs have a high chemical stability because of the high bond energy
(∼533 kJ mol–1) of the C–F bond, which
makes them persistent, bioaccumulative, and widely distributed in
the environment.14,15

Studying the interaction
of PFCs with liposomes, a model cell membrane,
may enable fundamental insights into the mechanism of cytotoxicity.
Some previous work has studied the effects of PFCs on cellular lipids,16−21 and some showed that PFCs increased the permeability of cell membranes
and altered membrane fluidity.16,17 PFCs also partitioned
into membranes,17,18 and PFCs with a longer chain
showed a higher tendency to penetrate into the bilayer.21 The phase transition of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) liposomes in the presence
of PFCs was also studied.18,19 PFCs were found to
lower and broaden the phase transition of DPPC membranes, in a way
similar to cholesterol.22,23 Most previous works
used advanced spectroscopy methods such as NMR and thermal methods
such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and studied only a
single type of lipid with one PFC. In this work, we systematically
studied the interactions of three PC liposomes with three PFCs, together
with three common surfactants and thus is a more systematic work.
In addition, we relied on common optical spectroscopy such as dynamic
light scattering (DLS), fluorescence spectroscopy, and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and such techniques are available to more
researchers. In complementary to previous studies, this work highlights
higher efficacy of PFCs than normal surfactants of the same carbon
chain length in affecting the property of lipid membranes.

Results
and Discussion
Insertion of the PFCs into Lipid Membranes
In this
study, we studied three types of PFCs (Figure 1a–c), which had carbon chains ranged
from six to eight. Two contained a sulfonate group and one contained
a carboxyl group, thus making them all negatively charged. In addition,
three commonly used small molecular surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), sodium 1-heptanesulfonate (SHS), and cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) (Figure 1d–f), were also included in this study. We chose to study
three types of liposomes: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DMPC), and DPPC (Figure 1g–i). PC is the most abundant headgroup in the outer
membrane of eukaryotic cells with an overall neutral charge. DOPC
has a phase transition temperature (Tc) of −20 °C, and thus it is in the fluid phase at room
temperature. DMPC has a Tc of 23 °C,
which is around room temperature allowing us to probe phase transition-related
properties with high sensitivity. Finally, DPPC has a Tc of 41 °C, displaying a gel phase behavior at room
temperature. These three lipids and six surfactants allowed us to
systematically understand the interactions and set this study apart
from most previous works that used only one lipid and one PFC.22,24

Figure 1 The
structures of the three PFCs: (a) PFOA, (b) PFOS, and (c) PFHxS;
three surfactants: (d) SDS, (e) SHS, and (f) CTAB; and three lipids:
(g) DOPC, (h) DMPC, and (i) DPPC used in this study.

Most previous works prepared PFCs containing liposomes
by mixing
lipids and PFCs before forming the liposomes. We herein prepared the
single-component PC liposomes first and added the PFCs later, which
better mimicked the real situation of cell membranes encountering
PFCs in the environment. It needs to be noted though, model liposomes
and real cell membranes are still quite different. The observations
are mainly from the standpoint of a reduced physical system, while
their biological implications need further studies to confirm. Because
DPPC, DMPC, and DOPC liposomes are charge neutral, whereas the PFCs
are negatively charged, we first monitored the zeta potential of the
liposomes upon gradually titrating the PFCs (Figure 2a). The zeta potential quickly dropped to
more negative upon addition of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid potassium
salt (PFHxS) (see Figure 1c for structure), whereas the same concentrations of PFHxS
alone (without liposomes) cannot produce light-scattering signals
because of its very low concentration (e.g., scattering intensity
only ∼10 kcps, whereas typically over 100 kcps is needed for
the measurement). The quick drop is an indication of insertion of
the PFCs into the membrane.25 The critical
micelle concentration (CMC) of PFHxS, perfluorooctanic acid (PFOA),
and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid potassium salt (PFOS) are 18–86,
25–30, and 6.3–8 mM, respectively.21,26,27 In order to avoid formation of micelles,
the final concentrations of these surfactants employed in this work
(<0.5 mM) were much lower than the reported CMC concentrations.
Because we have only titrated submM concentrations of the PFCs, the
lack of the light-scattering signal on their own is expected. Apparent
partition coefficient (APC) describes partitioning of a surfactant
into lipid bilayers versus those remained in the bulk aqueous phase.
The APCs of some PFCs and surfactants have been previously reported
in the literature (e.g., 6.3 × 104 for PFOS;16 1.0 × 104 for PFOA;20 1.0 × 104 for SDS;28 and 4.7 × 102 for SHS20). Therefore, we can approximate that the added
surfactants were all in the liposome membranes at low surfactant concentrations.

Figure 2 Effect
of PFHxS on the (a) zeta potential and (b) DLS size of DOPC,
DMPC, and DPPC liposomes (100 μg mL–1) in
10 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) buffer at 25 °C.

The lipid concentration in the above measurement was 100
μg
mL–1 (∼130 μM), and PFHxS saturated
the zeta potential at around 50 μM. This saturating PFHxS concentration
was comparable to the lipid concentration in the outer leaflet. This
is consistent with the fact that PFHxS can spontaneously insert themselves
to the liposome membrane and can reach a high loading.24 After 50 μM, whether more PFHxS can be
incorporated into the membrane was not clear from this experiment.
Similar observations of insertion of the PFCs into lipid membranes
were made by using other techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy,
DSC measurements, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance
techniques.20,29,30 Our surface charge measurement represented a simpler and label-free
method.

We then monitored the hydrodynamic diameter of the liposomes
upon
adding PFCs using DLS (Figure 2b). After adding PFHxS, the average size of our DPPC liposomes
remained the same as those without PFHxS. Similar observations were
also made with the DOPC and DMPC liposomes. Therefore, insertion of
PFHxS did not change the size of the liposomes. The DLS size of our
DOPC and DMPC liposomes in the presence of PFCs and other surfactants
was also measured. Most surfactants did not significantly change the
size of the liposomes, except that the size of the DMPC liposomes
doubled after adding CTAB (Figure S1).
This was attributed to the swelling of the DMPC liposomes in water
in the presence of cationic CTAB.31 For
the main topic of this study, the PFCs, they did not affect the liposome
size. The shape of the DMPC and DOPC liposomes remained spherical
after adding surfactants such as PFOS, SDS, and CTAB, as determined
by negative-stain TEM (Figure S2).

PFCs Increase
the Integrity of DPPC Liposomes
After
confirming that the PFCs could spontaneously insert themselves into
the liposomes, we then examined their effect on the integrity of the
liposomes. We prepared DPPC liposomes with 100 mM calcein encapsulated
inside. Such a high concentration of the dye induced self-quenching
of fluorescence, and liposome leakage could be reflected from fluorescence
enhancement. For the pure DPPC sample (Figure 3a), the fluorescence remained stable at low
temperature until ∼35 °C. After that, the liposome started
to leak and leakage continued until 47 °C. The gel phase DPPC
liposomes are known to leak when the temperature is approaching its Tc, whereas the liposome became stable again
passing Tc. We then took the first derivative
of this fluorescence trace, and the fastest leaking temperature was
found to be 40.5 °C (Figure 3b), consistent with its Tc of 41 °C. The area under this peak is proportional to the amount
of calcein fluorophore leaked. Therefore, our observation was consistent
with the literature,32 and our liposomes
were of high quality for content encapsulation. In the end, Triton
X-100 was added to fully rupture the liposomes and release all the
encapsulated calceins. This allowed us to estimate the fraction of
leakage at each temperature.

liposomes in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl). (a) Calcein

liposomes with different concentrations of PFOS (in the end, Triton
X-100 was added to fully rupture the liposomes and release all the
encapsulated calceins), and (d) the first derivatives of these releasing
data. (e) The peak area of the first derivatives plotted against the
concentration of the PFCs, and a large area indicated more calcein
release. (f) The fastest leaking temperature plotted against the concentration
of the PFCs.

The background fluorescence
in these experiments was due to free
calcein molecules outside the liposomes. Our column purification method
could not fully remove all the free calceins. Fortunately, the background
fluorescence changed very little as a function of temperature. The
first derivative of the melting curves is quite informative and can
minimize the difference in background fluorescence of different samples.

We then measured the same process in the presence of different
PFCs, and the amount of fluorescence increase dropped in each case.
For example, with 10 μM PFOS, the fastest leaking temperature
remained at 40.5 °C (Figure 3c,d). Further increase of the PFOS concentration led
to a shift to a lower peak temperature. We performed similar experiments
with the other two PFCs, and a similar trend was also observed (Figures S3–S6). The shifting of DPPC’s Tc to lower temperature is reminiscent of cholesterol.
Jbeily et al. discovered that fluorocarbon amphiphiles can affect
DPPC bilayers similarly to cholesterol using solid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy, DSC, and confocal microscopy.22 Brüning and Farago showed that PFOA had a similar
effect on DMPC as cholesterol by combining DLS and neutron spin-echo.24 Our work reinforced the similarity between PFCs
and cholesterol using different techniques.22

To have a quantitative comparison, we also plotted the area
under
the peak in Figure 3d, which is a reflection of the amount of calcein dye leaked (Figure 3e). This suggests
that PFOS can make the DPPC liposomes more resistant to temperature-induced
leakage. We also plotted the peak position of these three PFCs (Figure 3f). Interestingly,
it took even more PFOA to shift the peak temperature, whereas PFHxS
did not show any shift in the concentration range we tested. PFOS
and PFHxS have the same headgroup, but the former has eight fluorinated
carbons while the latter has only six. They showed a drastic difference
in their ability to shift the peak temperature. PFOA has seven fluorinated
carbons and also a different headgroup, and it sits between PFOS and
PFHxS in terms of peak shift and area. Therefore, the effect of the
headgroup chemistry appeared to be less important, whereas the fluorinated
carbon chain length governed the interaction.

For comparison,
we also tested SDS, which has an even longer carbon
chain (Figure 4a).
In this case, adding more SDS released more calcein, instead of stabilizing
the membrane (Figure 4b). The peak position also shifted to lower temperatures and this
is similar to the effect of the PFCs (Figure 4c). Similar observations were also made with
cationic CTAB (Figure 4d–f). We suspected that the main difference was the length
of the tails. Therefore, SHS, a seven carbon chain surfactant was
tested (see Figure 1e for structure), which has the same carbon chain length as PFOA.
Interestingly, SHS can also stabilize the lipid membrane as PFCs (Figure 4g–i). Therefore,
the inserted short chain PFCs (or SHS) did not make pores on the membrane.
The longer chains might affect lipid packing and thus cause leakages.
In addition, SDS and CTAB can form micelles at lower surfactant concentrations,
and these micelles might dissolve some lipids as a way to induce leakage.

Laurdan Dye as a Probe
The above calcein leakage assays
clearly indicated that the PFCs can affect the phase behavior of liposomes.
To further study on this front, Laurdan was also used as a probe.
Laurdan is a dye commonly used to diagnose a membrane’s phase
behavior.33,34 Different from hydrophilic calcein loaded
in the aqueous compartment of liposomes, Laurdan is embedded within
the hydrophobic bilayer region. To conform the successful incorporation
of Laurdan dye to our DMPC liposomes (Tc = 23 °C), we measured its fluorescence as a function of temperature
(Figure S7). At 30 °C, DMPC was in
its fluid phase, the Laurdan emission red shifted to a peak wavelength
at 480 nm with respect to that in the gel phase at 20 °C of 450
nm. This was consistent with the literature report.33−35 After confirming
the quality of the Larudan-loaded liposomes, the PFCs were, respectively,
added, and the emission shifted from 450 to 480 nm (Figure 5a–c). It indicated that
the PFCs have made the membranes to a more fluid phase.20

Figure 5 Normalized fluorescence emission spectra of Laurdan-loaded
DMPC
liposomes in buffer A after adding various concentrations of (a) PFOA,
(b) PFOS, (c) PFHxS, (d) SHS, (e) SDS, and (f) CTAB. Laurdan-loaded
DMPC liposomes (100 μg mL–1) in 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.6, and 100 mM NaCl.

When SHS was added to the DMPC liposomes, the Laurdan emission
did not shift (Figure 5d). This means that the perfluoroalkyl carbon chains in the PFCs
were the main factor influencing the DMPC membrane. Similar experiments
were performed with SDS and CTAB. SDS was accompanied by the shift
of emission from 450 to 500 nm (Figure 5e), whereas for CTAB, a moderate shift of emission
from 450 to 460 nm was observed (Figure 5f). Therefore, most of these surfactants
increased the fluidity of the DMPC membrane. Comparing SHS and SDS,
a longer carbon chain produced a larger effect. Although the PFCs
were shorter in the chain length than SDS, they produced a similar
shift, suggesting that the perfluorinated chains were more potent
in this regard than the hydrocarbon chain. The increased fluidity
corresponded to a lower Tc and this was
also consistent with the calcein leakage data, where peak leakage
occurred at lower temperatures with the surfactants. Laurdan fluorescence
experiment for the DOPC system has been carried out. The emission
of Laurdan-loaded DOPC is 480 nm and cannot be changed by PFCs and
other surfactants (Figure S8).

To
quantitatively evaluate the Laurdan emission spectra data, the
membrane fluidity at different concentrations of the PFCs or other
surfactants was expressed by generalized polarization GP = (I440 – I490)/(I440 + I490), where I440 and I490 are the emission intensities at these two wavelengths,
respectively.36 A larger GP value corresponds
to lower membrane fluidity. As shown in Figure 6, the surfactants with a larger GP value
change are more potent in fluidizing the membrane.

Figure 6 (a) GP values of the
Laurdan dye in the DMPC liposome after adding
various concentrations of the PFCs or surfactants. (b) The fastest
calcein leaking temperature plotted against GP in the presence of
various surfactants (100 μM). CTAB was omitted because it was
used at very different concentrations for these two experiments. A
larger GP value corresponds to lower membrane fluidity.

Because we now have two ways of analyzing the surfactant
effect
from calcein leakage and from the shift of the Laurdan emission, we
wanted to see whether these two effects were correlated or not. For
this purpose, we plotted the fastest leaking temperature and GP at
the same concentration of surfactants. Indeed, the fastest leaking
temperature increased with the increase of GP.

Effect of Nanoparticles
on Membrane Integrity
The above
assays mainly focused on the phase transition of the liposomes, and
we confirmed that the PFCs could be inserted into the membrane. In
the environment, the cell membranes may also encounter various nanomaterials
and their adsorption might also cause leakage of liposomes.37−39 Thus, we were also interested in understanding how such PFC-inserted
liposomes react with nanoparticles. AuNPs and SiO2 NPs
were used as representative nanomaterials for the test. AuNPs represent
a metal, whereas SiO2 represents a nonmetallic material.
AuNPs can leak DOPC liposomes as we have reported before.32 and this is also reflected in Figure 7a. When the PFCs or SDS was
added to the liposome first followed by adding the AuNPs, the DOPC
liposomes did not leak. SHS and CTAB alone can induce partial leakage
of DOPC liposomes (Figure S9). For SiO2 NPs, a high salt concentration was needed to promote its
interaction with PC liposomes.40 Similar
to the AuNPs, PFCs and SDS inhibited membrane leakage induced by SiO2 NPs (Figure 7b). However, CTAB boosted DOPC leakage with SiO2 NPs.
It may be related to the positive charge of CTAB that attracted negatively
charged SiO2 NPs. It is worth mentioning that SHS did not
have any effect on SiO2-induced DOPC leakage. Overall,
all of the PFCs stabilized the liposomes against nanoparticle-induced
leakage.

Figure 7 Effect of the PFCs and surfactants on the leakage of calcein-loaded
DOPC liposomes with (a) AuNPs and (b) SiO2 NPs. At 3 min,
various surfactants were, respectively, added to the liposomes. At
6 min, AuNPs or SiO2 NPs were added, and at 9 min, Triton
X-100 was added. For AuNPs, the reaction was in buffer A, whereas
for SiO2, the buffer was 10 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, and
pH 7.6.

Conclusions
In
summary, the interaction of three common PFCs with a few representative
PC liposomes was systematically studied using various techniques including
DLS, Laurdan fluorescence, TEM, and liposome leakage assays. Three
types of PC liposomes with the same headgroup chemistry but with different Tcs were investigated. The DLS data showed that
the PFCs can all be inserted into lipid membranes, while they had
little effect on the hydrodynamic diameter of liposomes. The melting
curves indicated that PFCs increased the thermal stability of liposomes
because the amount of dye leaked decreased, although Tcs were shifted to lower temperatures. At room temperature,
the PFCs failed to induce any leakage of the liposomes and they even
inhibited liposome leakage induced by two representative inorganic
nanoparticles. Compared with common surfactants such as SHS, SDS,
and CTAB, the perfluoroalkyl carbon chains in the PFCs are the primary
factor of influencing the lipid membranes. With different types of
surfactants and lipids, this work provides a comprehensive fundamental
understanding of the interaction between lipid bilayers and PFCs,
which may offer insights into the interaction with cell membranes
and toxicity of PFCs.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All
of the phospholipids used in this study,
including DOPC, DMPC, and DPPC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, AL). PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, SHS, disodium calcein, 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene
(Laurdan), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. SDS,
CTAB, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES),
sodium phosphate, and sodium chloride were purchased from Mandel Scientific
(Guelph, ON, Canada). Milli-Q water was used to prepare all buffers
and suspensions.

Preparation of Liposomes
Our liposomes
were prepared
using the standard extrusion method, as described previously.41 Briefly, DOPC, DMPC, or DPPC (2.5 mg) was dissolved
in chloroform. After evaporating chloroform by N2, the
samples were dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature overnight
to fully remove chloroform. The dried lipid films were stored at −20
°C in a N2 atmosphere prior to use. To prepare DOPC
liposomes, the lipid films were hydrated with 0.5 mL of buffer A (10
mM HEPES, pH 7.6 with 100 mM NaCl) yielding a lipid concentration
of 5 mg mL–1. The resulting cloudy suspension was
extruded 21 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes with
a pore size of 100 nm. Because DMPC has a phase transition temperature
(Tc) of 23 °C, its lipid films were
hydrated at 35 °C for 2 h and were extruded at 35 °C, whereas
DPPC (Tc of 41 °C) was hydrated and
extruded at 60 °C. To encapsulate calcein, the lipid films (DOPC
or DPPC) were hydrated with 100 mM calcein overnight followed by extrusion.
Free calcein was removed by passing 35 μL of the sample through
a PD-10 column using buffer A for elution. The first 600 μL
of the fluorescent fraction was collected. Laurdan-loaded DMPC liposomes
were prepared by mixing 10 μL of Laurdan (1 mM) with 500 μL
of DMPC lipid (5 mg mL–1) in chloroform. Then, similar
procedures were carried out for hydration and extrusion at 35 °C.

Zeta Potential and DLS
The zeta potential and hydrodynamic
diameter of the liposomes with different concentrations of PFCs were
measured on a Zetasizer Nano ZS 90 instrument (Malvern) with a He–Ne
laser (633 nm) at 90° optics at 25 °C. A PFHxS solution
was gradually titrated to DOPC, DMPC, and DPPC liposome suspensions
(100 μg mL–1 in 10 mM HEPES for pH 7.6), respectively.
The data were analyzed by Malvern Dispersion Technology software 4.20.

Melting Curves
To study the effect of the PFCs and
surfactants on the thermal stability of the liposomes, calcein-loaded
DPPC liposomes were used. 5 μL of calcein-loaded DPPC liposomes
was first added to 595 μL of buffer A. Then, different concentrations
of PFCs, SDS, SHS, and CTAB solutions were, respectively, added to
the above DPPC liposomes solution. Finally, 50 μL of each mixed
sample was loaded into a real-time PCR tube and the temperature was
increased by 1 °C from 4 to 80 °C with a 2 min equilibrate
time at each designated temperature. Then, the fluorescence intensity
of the sample was measured at the end of each 2 min incubation using
the FAM channel. The first derivatives of the fluorescence increase
curves were also plotted.

Laurdan-Loaded Liposome Assays
Laurdan-loaded
DMPC
liposomes (5 mg mL–1, 10 μL) were first added
to 490 μL of buffer A in a quartz cuvette at room temperature.
Then, different concentrations of PFCs, SDS, SHS, and CTAB were, respectively,
titrated into the DMPC sample. The Laurdan fluorescence was monitored
by a Varian Eclipse fluorometer with an excitation wavelength at 340
nm. Note that the Laurdan dye was loaded in the hydrophobic region
of the bilayer, whereas calcein was loaded in the internal aqueous
compartment of the liposomes.

Liposome Leakage by Nanoparticles
To monitor liposome
leakage, 5 μL of the above purified calcein-loaded DPPC liposomes
was added to 595 μL of buffer A in a quartz cuvette at room
temperature. The background fluorescence was monitored for 3 min before
adding the PFCs (or SDS, or SHS, or CTAB). The fluorescence was monitored
for another 3 min followed by adding 10 μL of 13 nm citrate-capped
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 10 nM) or silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs, 1 mg mL–1). At 9 min, 10 μL
of 5% Triton X-100 was added to fully rupture the liposomes. Calcein
was excited at 485 nm, and its emission was monitored at 525 nm.
