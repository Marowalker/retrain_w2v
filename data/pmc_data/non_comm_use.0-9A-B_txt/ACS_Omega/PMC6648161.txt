The
mechanism of l-lactate generation from pyruvate by l-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the rabbit muscle was studied
theoretically by the multistructural microiteration (MSM) method combined
with the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)–ONIOM
method, where the MSM method describes the MM environment as a weighted
average of multiple different structures that are fully relaxed during
geometry optimization or a reaction path calculation for the QM part.
The results showed that the substrate binding and product states were
stabilized only in the open-loop conformation of LDH and the reaction
occurred in the closed-loop conformation. In other words, before and
after the chemical reaction, a large-scale structural transition from
the open-loop conformation to the closed-loop conformation and vice
versa occurred. The closed-loop conformation stabilized the transition
state of the reaction. In contrast, the open-loop conformation stabilized
the substrate binding and final states. In other words, the closed-
to open-loop transition at the substrate binding state urges capture
of the substrate molecule, the subsequent open- to closed-loop transition
promotes the product generation, and the final closed- to open-loop
transition at the final state prevents the reverse reaction going
back to the substrate binding state. It is thus suggested that the
exchange of stability between the closed- and open-loop conformations
at different states promotes the catalytic cycle.

1 Introduction
Enzyme
catalysis generally proceeds under moderate conditions and
is fast and highly selective.1,2 Enzyme catalysis has
therefore been applied to syntheses of various organic compounds.2−4 In general, the entire process of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction consists
of three steps; that is, substrate binding, catalytic reaction in
the active site, and product release.5 It
has been shown experimentally that some catalytic reactions proceed
with a large-scale structural transition in the surrounding protein.6−9 In such cases, one needs to take into account the large structural
change in the surrounding protein before and after the chemical reaction
that occurs at a local active site. However, revealing the roles of
such a large structural change either experimentally or theoretically
is challenging.2,4

l-Lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) exists in various organisms,
and its catalytic mechanism has been the topic of many experimental
and computational studies.10−23 LDH catalyzes a reversible transformation of pyruvate to l-lactate in the presence of NADH/NAD+ as a cofactor. Holbrook
and co-workers proposed that the mechanism of this transformation
consists of the five steps shown in Figure 1.7 In this mechanism,
substrate binding occurs while LDH is in the open-loop conformation.
Then, LDH changes its form to the closed-loop conformation. The transformation
of pyruvate to l-lactate occurs while LDH is in the closed-loop
conformation. The product is released with LDH in the open-loop conformation.
This proposed mechanism involves large-scale structural transitions
from the closed-loop conformation to the open-loop conformation and
vice versa. The closure of the open loop over the active site after
substrate binding is considered to be the rate-limiting step in the
LDH catalytic process of wild-type Bacillus stearothermophilus.22

catalytic process.7

Figure 2 illustrates
the transformation of pyruvate to l-lactate in the LDH active
site. In early theoretical studies, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics
(QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) calculations were performed to examine
whether these events occur in a concerted or stepwise manner.18−20 Recently, free energy surfaces were calculated for two collective
variables through QM/MM MD simulations using the AM1 and RM1 methods
for the QM part.21 After making a correction
based on density functional theory calculations, these free energy
surfaces showed that proton and hydride transfers were concerted in
LDH from the rabbit muscle. This theoretical result is supported experimentally
by a recent spectroscopic study.10

The roles of closed- and open-loop conformations of LDH are
not
yet well understood theoretically. In principle, their behavior can
be studied if MD trajectories over a long timescale can be computed
at a QM or QM/MM level.24 The QM/MM free
energy perturbation method coupled with geometry optimization calculations
is another approach to study this topic.25−29 However, these calculations could be practically
difficult because of the high computational cost to achieve converged
statistical sampling describing the slow structural transition between
open- and closed-loop conformations. We therefore use an alternative
approach in which both open- and closed-loop conformations are prepared
beforehand and then the entire structure is expressed as a weighted
sum of these conformations. The weight changes depending on the stage
of the reaction cycle and the transition between the two conformations
are described as changes in weight. Such a calculation can be performed
easily in the framework of our recently proposed multistructural microiteration
(MSM) method.30

2 Theoretical
Background
In this study, the structures of two conformations
of LDH are prepared
by replica-exchange MD simulations.31 Then,
twelve initial structures are prepared. Among the twelve structures,
six have an open-loop conformation and the other six have a closed-loop
conformation. To distinguish between the two conformations, we introduced
four distance parameters which are Cα-Glu103 and Cα-Tyr238,
O3-pyruvate and CZ-Arg105, O1-pyruvate and CZ-Arg105, and CZ-Arg105
and CZ-Arg168 (see Figure S1). The structures
with distances between Cα-Glu103 and Cα-Tyr238, O3-pyruvate
and CZ-Arg105, O1-pyruvate and CZ-Arg105, and CZ-Arg105 and CZ-Arg168
of longer than 13, 8, 10, and 13 Å are regarded as open-loop
conformation. Experimental values for these distances for open-loop
conformations are 17.9, 12.0, 15.2, and 18.6 Å, while those for
closed-loop ones are 8.0, 3.9, 4.5, and 7.2 Å.32 Details of the structural preparation are described in
the Computational Details section. In the conventional QM/MM, our
own N-layer integrated molecular orbital molecular
mechanics (ONIOM) method,33,34 the total energy E is expressed as 1  where Emodel-QM, Emodel-MM, and Ereal-MM correspond to the
QM energy of the model
system, MM energy of the model system, and MM energy of the real system,
respectively. In contrast, in the QM/MM–ONIOM–MSM method, E is expressed as 2  where N is the number of
structures considered and Ereal-MM(i) corresponds to the energy of the ith structure. The weight ωi is
given as 3  where β = 1/kBTMSM, in which kB is the Boltzmann constant and TMSM is a model temperature parameter (see Computational Details section).30 During geometry optimization, all the N structures in the real system were optimized one-by-one
with the atoms fixed in the model system (reaction-center region)
before changing the positions of atoms in the model system. In other
words, the optimization of the model system was performed in the geometrical
subspace in which the gradient of the region not involved in the reaction
(part of the real system excluding the model system) was zero.

The minimum energy path (MEP) for the abovementioned reaction process
was computed. The MEP was obtained by optimizing an initial path using
the locally updated plane (LUP) method.35 Initial paths were obtained as described below. During the path
optimization, energy peaks (maxima) were directly optimized to transition
states (TSs) using the quasi-Newton method. Three different calculations
were performed: (i) a mixed calculation in which all twelve structures
were used, (ii) an open-only calculation in which only the six structures
with the open-loop conformation were used, and (iii) a closed-only
calculation in which only the six structures with the closed-loop
conformation were used. In calculations (ii) and (iii), the system
adopts either an open- or closed-loop conformation throughout the
calculation. The open- to closed-loop conformational transition or
vice versa could only take place in calculation (i). The results of
these three calculations are compared below. In calculation (i), the
initial path was generated by the artificial force-induced reaction
(AFIR) method.36 In contrast, in calculations
(ii) and (iii), the MEP of the mixed calculation was used as the initial
path, and then the six surrounding structures with the nontarget conformation
were deleted before performing the LUP path optimization.

3 Results and Discussion
An energy profile and variations
of ωi along the MEP obtained by
the mixed calculation are shown
in Figure 3a,b, respectively.
Three energy peaks were observed in the MEP, where the highest peak
corresponds to the TS of concerted proton and hydride transfers. In Figure 3b, ωi changed around the first and third peaks. The first
and third peaks therefore describe the open- to closed-loop and closed-
to open-loop structural transitions, respectively. Among the three
peaks, the highest peak corresponds to the TS. The other two peaks
were arisen through the dramatical change in ωi; we therefore call these energy maxima as surrounding structural
TSs (SSTSs). For coordinates of the reaction-center atoms (atoms in
the QM model system plus those bonded to the QM model system), each
SSTS is a local maximum along the MEP of the potential energy surface
calculated by the MSM method. We note that each SSTS also corresponds
to a local minimum in the geometrical subspace in which the two main
contributing surrounding structures have the same energy. Therefore,
assuming immediate thermal equilibration for the surrounding structure,
each SSTS corresponds to the energetically most preferred structure
at which the population moves from one surrounding structure to the
other. Figure 3b shows
that the system adopts the open-loop conformation before SSTS1, the
closed-loop conformation between SSTS1 and SSTS3, and the open-loop
conformation again after SSTS3. This behavior is consistent with the
mechanism in Figure 1 proposed from experimental results.

Figure 3 (a) Energy profile and (b) variation of
weight factors ωi along the MEP

The s-coordinates are defined as a distance between
discretized structures along the MEP.

Figure 4 compares
energy profiles of the corresponding paths obtained from the open-only
(denoted o) and closed-only (denoted c) calculations with the path of the mixed (denoted m) calculation. On the energy profile, surrounding structural features
in open- or closed-loop conformations are clearly distinguishable
(see Table S1). At the substrate binding
equilibrium state EQ1, the open-loop conformation m(o)EQ1 is more
stable than the closed-loop conformation cEQ1. Therefore,
the substrate binding is likely to take place in the open-loop conformation.
The mSSTS1, which describes the structural transition
from the open-loop conformation to the closed-loop conformation, leads
to intermediate state m(c)EQ2. Then, the concerted proton and hydride
transfers occur from m(c)EQ2 through m(c)TS2. Meanwhile, oEQ1 is directly connected to oTS2. After passing oTS2, the system again directly reaches the most stable
state m(o)EQ4. In contrast, the EQs in the closed-loop conformation,
m(c)EQ3 and cEQ4, are both less stable than m(o)EQ4.
From m(c)EQ3, the system can also reach m(o)EQ4 accompanying the surrounding
structural transition through mSSTS3. Figure 4 clearly shows that the path
obtained by the mixed calculation is the most energetically favorable
path, and the surrounding structural transitions through mSSTS1 and mSSTS3 are necessary for the system to
follow this path. In addition, the energy landscape was not largely
affected (only ∼2.0 kcal mol–1) by the polarization
effects taken by the electronic embedding scheme as shown in Figure 4. The calculated
activation energy 22.3 kcal mol–1 is larger than
an experimental value 14.0 kcal mol–1 obtained by
taking a logarithm of observed kcat (=
245 s–1) at 295 K.37,38 Taking account
of the free-energy correction at 295 K estimated based on the harmonic
vibrational analysis, the activation energy for this step decreased
from 22.3 to 19.4 kcal mol–1 showing a better agreement
with the experimental value, although the value still is larger than
the experimental one. One reason would be because initial surrounding
structures were prepared at the reactant state. This treatment may
significantly overestimate relative stability of the reactant state
and consequently the barrier height. However, we believe that the
relative stability between open- and closed-loop conformations at
each state, which is the main focus of this study, can be discussed
from the results in Figure 4. There are many other factors that may affect the computational
barrier height such as QM computational level, size of the QM part,
parameters of the MM force field, efficiency of quantum tunneling,
and dynamical fluctuation in the surrounding part, although taking
these into account is beyond the scope of this study.

Figure 4 Energy diagram of the
LDH catalytic process obtained from the mixed
(m), open-only (o), and closed-only
(c) calculations. EQ, TS, and SSTS are denoted as
EQn, TSm, and SSTSl, respectively, where mEQ, mTS, and mSSTS are those obtained from
the m calculation; oEQ and oTS are
those obtained from the o calculation; and cEQ and cTS are those obtained from the c calculation. It should
be noted that mEQ1, mEQ2, mEQ3, mEQ4, and mTS2 are
identical to oEQ1, cEQ2, cEQ3, oEQ4, and cTS2,
respectively. The volume, which is estimated with assuming that each
atom is a sphere with 1.5 times of the corresponding van der Waals
radius, and single point energies estimated by the electronic embedding
scheme are shown in parentheses and square bracket, respectively.

Interestingly, the profile in Figure 4 reveals that the
reaction does not only
proceed in the closed-loop conformation. Without the surrounding structural
transition to the open-loop conformation through mSSTS3, the reaction is reversible because the stability of cEQ4 is similar to that of cEQ1. The surrounding
structural transition from the open-loop conformation to the closed-loop
conformation through mSSTS1 shifts the reaction bottleneck
from oTS2 to the lower energy m(c)TS2 and also promotes
the reaction. We therefore conclude that the exchanges between the
two conformations play roles in facilitating the reaction in the present
system.

Next, we discuss reaction-center structures along the
MEPs. At
all the EQs and TSs in Figure 4, the volume which is estimated with assuming that each atom
is a sphere with 1.5 times of the corresponding van der Waals radius
is smaller in the closed-loop conformation than in the open-loop conformation
throughout the process. This indicates that the open-loop conformation
provides a larger reaction space than the closed-loop conformation.
At TS2, the substrate must approach both His192 and NADH to transfer
the proton and hydride. It is known in hydrogen-bonded cluster systems
that a tight reaction space accelerates proton transfers.39,40 Consequently, the volume is the smallest at TS2 in the entire energy
profile. Figure 5a–c
compares structures of oTS2 and cTS2. The distances between the proton/hydride donor and acceptor
are shorter in cTS2 than in oTS2
because of the tighter reaction space in the closed-loop conformation
than in the open-loop conformation. In contrast, the greater space
is available in the substrate binding state EQ1 and the final product
state EQ4 than in TS2. In EQ4, the open-loop conformation allows the
product to rotate in the reaction space and adopt a more stable configuration,
as shown in Figure 5d–f. Because the substrate can move easily in the open-loop
conformation, the system can reach the more stable configurations
EQ1 and EQ4 directly without being captured at the tighter configurations
EQ2 and EQ3. In short, the volume is small in the closed-loop conformation
but is large in the open-loop conformation, while the volume is small
at TS2 but is large at EQ1 and EQ4. In other words, the closed-loop
conformation fits well to TS2, while the open-loop conformation fits
well to EQ1 and EQ4. We thus propose that the volume matching is one
factor controlling the variation of relative stability between the
two conformations along the reaction path. The volume matching would
strengthen some attractive interactions such as electrostatic interactions
between the QM and MM parts and enhance stability of one of conformations
at each state.

Figure 5 Reaction-center structures: (a) superposition of oTS2 (red) and cTS2 (blue), (b) oTS2, (c) cTS2, (d) superposition of oEQ4 (red) and cEQ4 (blue), (e) oEQ4, and (f) cEQ4. Distances (in Å)
between
the proton/hydride donor and acceptor at TS2 are shown in parentheses.

Figure 6 shows structural
differences between EQ1 and EQ2 and between EQ3 and EQ4. The difference
between cEQ1 and m(o)EQ1 is in the interaction form
between pyruvate and His192. The cEQ1 becomes m(c)EQ2
via cTS1 through the reorientation of His192 as highlighted
in Figure 6a by an
arrow. Although structures of m(c)EQ3 and cEQ4 resemble
each other as shown in Figure 6b,
changes occur in the surrounding structure through the movement of
acetamide group in NAD via cTS3 as highlighted in Figure 6b by an arrow. The
energy difference between m(c)EQ3 and cEQ4 is 13.4
kcal mol–1. The energy lowering of cEQ4 is due to the surrounding structural difference between m(c)EQ3
and cEQ4, where QM and MM components of the energy
difference in m(c)EQ3 and cEQ4 (l-lactate)
were 3.7 and −17.1 kcal mol–1, respectively.

structures: (a) superposition of m(o)EQ1 (red), cEQ1 (blue), and cEQ2 (yellow), and (b)
superposition of m(c)EQ3 (red), cTS3 (blue), and cEQ4 (yellow).

Finally, we discuss about four issues in the model adopted
in this
study. First, a previous study showed that formation of the tetramer
structure of LDH affects the active site structure and the binding
energy of the substrate.41 Because interactions
between different chains were not considered in our model, it is expected
that the energy profile in Figure 4 changes when the tetramer structure is used. Second,
the dynamic fluctuation of the entire molecule that affects the entropic
term of the free energy barrier is not taken into account by the MSM
method. Third, it was shown that the transition between open- and
closed-loop configurations was the slowest process among several reaction
steps in the entire reaction.22 On the
other hand, the MSM method describes the open to closed transition
just as the weight change occurring along the reaction coordinate
for the reaction-center part. In other words, actual atomic motions
as well as the time required in the transition are not considered
explicitly by the MSM method. Nevertheless, the MSM method is useful
for predicting the sequence of stability changes in the surrounding
structure part occurring along the reaction coordinate for the reaction-center
part. Beyond this model, couplings between motions in the reaction-center
part and the surrounding structure must be taken into account through
QM/MM-MD simulations in the future. Fourth, we used twelve surrounding
structures with six open- and six closed-loop conformations in this
study. As shown in Figure 3b, the entire catalytic process was represented only with
four surrounding structures, that is, “open 1”, “open
3”, “closed 1”, and “closed 4”.
From this fact, we concluded that twelve were enough in this system.
It should be noted that the number of structures required to describe
an entire process would change depending on systems. It is thus recommended
to prepare twice or more of structures than those required to describe
the system.

4 Conclusions
We studied the roles of the open- and closed-loop
conformations
in the transformation reaction of pyruvate to l-lactate in
LDH. The substrate binding state and final product binding state are
more stable in the open-loop conformation than in the closed-loop
conformation. In contrast, the TS for the concerted proton and hydride
transfers is more stable in the closed-loop conformation. These stability
differences at different states are found to correlate with the variation
of the volume of the reaction center along the MEP, where the initial
and final binding states are stabilized in the larger reaction space
of the open-loop conformation and the TS is stabilized in the smaller
reaction space of the closed-loop conformation. We suggest that the
exchanges of the stability between the open- and closed-loop conformations
at the different states play the central role in promoting the present
reaction in one direction.

5 Computational Details
The initial structure was obtained from the protein data bank (PDB
code: 3H3F).32 The structure of LDH from the rabbit muscle
consists of two independent tetramers, each of which has four active
sites; that is, two with the open-loop conformation and the other
two with the closed-loop conformation. The model structure was built
using chain C (closed loop) and D (open loop), where oxamate in the
PDB structure was replaced by the reactant pyruvate. Hydrogen atoms
were added assuming the normal protonation states at a pH of 7.0 using
the PROPKA program,42,43 and His192 was manually protonated.
The charged protein was neutralized with chlorine ions and fully solvated
in the octahedron water box. To prepare the surrounding structures
in the open- and closed-loop conformations, two replica exchange MD
simulations with fixing of reaction-center atoms were performed: one
for the open-loop conformation and the other for the closed-loop conformation.
In each MD simulation, 20 replicas for the temperature range of 300
to 400 K were used and 5 000 000 steps were computed
for each replica.31 Time step size and
cutoff radius were set to 0.1 (fs) and 12.0 Å, respectively.
Structures were printed every 10 000 MD steps, and among the
10 000 printed structures (500 for each replica), the six with
the lowest energies were chosen as the initial surrounding structures
of the open- and closed-loop conformations. Distance parameters defined
at the theoretical back ground and distances between CZ-Arg168 and
O1-pyruvate, and CZ-Arg168 and O3-pyruvate during MD simulations were
shown in Figure S2. Afterward, aqueous
environment molecules more than 50 Å away from the center of
protein coordinates and counterions were removed for the reaction
path calculations, where total charge of the protein was +2. From
open- and closed-loop conformations, both six initial structures were
merged for the mixed-loop calculations. Among the twelve structures,
six have an open-loop conformation and the other six have a closed-loop
conformation. It should be noted that our model structure constructs
from a single reaction-center and twelve different surrounding structures.

The B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory and general AMBER force field44 were used as the high-level QM and low-level
MM methods, respectively. The mechanical embedding scheme33,34 was employed in all calculations, while the electronic embedding
scheme45,46 was used for single-point calculations.
AMBER force field parameters of NADH cofactor and pyruvate were obtained
from generalized AMBER force field files (gaff.dat). The reaction
center consisted of 46 atoms including the three link atoms placed
at the QM/MM boundary indicated by wavy lines in Figure 2. All molecular structures
were depicted by the UCSF Chimera package.47 The MEP calculations were performed by the MSM method using the
GRRM program combined with the Gaussian 09 program.30,48,49 The initial path of the mixed calculation
was obtained by the AFIR method with the model collision energy parameter
of the AFIR method set to γ = 150 kJ/mol and the model temperature
parameter of the MSM method set to TMSM = 50 000 K; these settings are discussed in our previous
papers.30,36 The artificial force was applied to two
atom pairs: between the shifting proton and acceptor oxygen and between
the shifting hydride and acceptor carbon. The initial path was further
optimized by the LUP path optimization method,35 where the model temperature parameter of the MSM method
was set to TMSM = 300 K. Three different
LUP calculations were performed (as discussed in the main text): (i)
a mixed calculation, (ii) an open-only calculation, and (iii) a closed-only
calculation. During the LUP calculations, all energy maxima were directly
optimized to actual TSs using the quasi-Newton algorithm.
