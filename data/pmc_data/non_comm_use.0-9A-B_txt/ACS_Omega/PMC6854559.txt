Titanium
(Ti) and its alloys are widely used in the dental and
prosthetic implant fields due to their favorable biocompatibility.
In this study, porous surface coatings incorporated with nanoscale
hydroxyapatite particles on the surface of Ti and Ti–5Zr–3Sn–5Mo–25Nb
(TLM) alloy were fabricated by microarc oxidation followed by hydrothermal
treatment; the surface roughness and hydrophilicity were obviously
enhanced by the surface modification procedure. In vivo, four adult
male beagle dogs were selected for an implantation procedure and restored
with full metal crowns after healing for 3 months. The bone responses
were evaluated via histomorphological observation. Raman spectral
analysis and nanoindentation experiments were used to quantitatively
and qualitatively estimate the characteristics of the bone formed
around the implants. Compared to the Ti group, the TLM titanium alloy
group showed a significant increase in the percentage of bone–implant
interface contact, bone inside the thread, mineralization, crystallinity,
modulus of elasticity, and hardness of the integrated bone after delayed
loading in the TLM group. Therefore, the TLM titanium alloy is considered
a candidate implant material with desirable biomechanical compatibility,
especially under applied stress.

1 Introduction
For more than half a century,
titanium and its alloys have been
widely used in the medical field as dental implants and prosthetic
materials because of their better biocompatibility, mechanical properties,
and corrosion resistance to other metallic biomaterials.1,2 Implants are expected to combine with bone tissue and successfully
withstand the forces of chewing over the lifetime of a patient. To
achieve this goal, biomaterials are required to have ideal bioactivity
and biomechanical compatibility.

β-Type titanium alloys
have attracted particular attention
in recent years and benefit from their intrinsic low elastic modulus
that is favorable for homogeneous stress transmission between the
implant and bone.3,4 These alloys show better mechanical
properties to reduce stress shielding effect comparable to commercial
pure Ti or Ti–6Al–4V. They are being developed and trialed
continuously. Modulus mismatch is responsible for complications, such
as peri-implant bone disuse atrophy5 and
implant loosening or fracture as a result of stress shielding and
concentration.6,7 Moreover, modulus mismatch leads
to micromotion at the bone–implant interface and excessive
micromotion inhibits bone formation, leading to fibrous tissue ingrowth
and implant loosening.8 This paper focused
on the Ti–5Zr–3Sn–5Mo–25Nb (TLM) alloy
consists of nontoxic, nonallergenic, and nonvanadium elements. A large
number of new β-type Ti alloys have been developed via the addition
of alloying elements such as Mo, Nb, Ta, Zr, Mn, Sn, etc. to suppress
the elastic modulus and enhance the strength of alloys. They also
exhibited superior corrosion resistance and superior biocompatibility
to Ti and other alloys.9−12 The Ti–5Zr–3Sn–5Mo–25Nb (TLM) alloy
has an elastic modulus of approximately 50 GPa, closer to the elastic
modulus of cortical bone (∼30 GPa), which also exhibits a balance
between high strength and low modulus.13 Niinomi and colleagues developed a β-type titanium Ti–29Nb–13Ta–4.6Zr
(TNTZ) alloy which displayed superior application as load-bearing
biomaterial.14 The alloy composites and
elastic modulus were similar to those of the TLM alloy.15,16 Furthermore, Sn and Mo were proposed to reduce the consumption of
high-cost elements such as Ta of TNTZ and additionally contribute
to the enhancement of corrosion resistance and mechanical properties.15,17 TLM alloy may be more suitable to be used as a metal for dental
casting to TNTZ alloy, which has considerably high melting point.16

Osseointegration is strongly influenced
by the surface morphology
and the surface chemistry of dental implants. Microarc oxidation (MAO)
is a simple, controllable, and cost-effective surface modification
method for producing a stable porous titanium oxide layer doped with
calcium, phosphate, and iron in situ.18,19 Titanium oxide
coatings created by the MAO process show good biofunction and tribocorrosion
resistance.20−22 Previously, an MAO coating on titanium was broadly
found to have excellent effects on cell responses and early osteointegration.23,24 In the work of Zhou et al.,25 implants
with MAO coating were implanted into the femoral condyles of New Zealand
rabbits to evaluate their performance in vivo. Their results suggested
that MAO coating possesses an excellent bone apposition capability
in the bone/implant interface. Meanwhile, porous structure created
by MAO can provide good biological fixation through bone tissue ingrowth
into the porous network as well as further reduce elastic modulus
of Ti-based alloys.26 On the other hand,
hydrothermal treatment (Htt) is the optimal method to incorporate
hydroxyapatite (HA) on a titanium oxide layer.27 The composition and structure of HA are similar to human
bone to promote biological compatibility and osteoconductivity.28 In a previous in vivo test, the TLM alloy with
an active porous/HA microstructure showed favorable tribotology and
corrosion behavior, biocompatibility, and osteoconductivity to promote
osteointegration.29,30

In this study, we estimated
the bone–implant interface contact
(BIC) and percentage of bone inside the thread (BIT) and detected
the bone quality through Raman spectrum analysis. Moreover, a nanoindentation
test was used to evaluate the mechanical properties of integrated
bone. Importantly, we assumed that a β titanium-based alloy
with porous coating shows better bone remodeling than pure titanium
under functional condition. The aim of this study was to investigate
the biomechanical behavior, biocompatibility, and bioactivity of a
Ti–5Zr–3Sn–5Mo–25Nb (TLM) alloy as a dental
implant material and to compare it with commercially pure Ti.

2 Results
2.1 Surface Properties
The surface morphology
differed drastically among the groups. As observed via field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (Figure 1), the control Ti-S surface exhibited a relatively
smooth surface with machining stripes, while a microporous microstructure
layer was observed on the Ti-MAO sample, similar to dentin tubules;
additional nano-HA structures covered the porous microstructure in
the Ti-MAO-Htt group. The Ra was 0.253
± 0.028, 1.674 ± 0.032, 1.671 ± 0.025, and 1.668 ±
0.022 μm for the TLM-S, TLM-MAO, TLM-MAO-Htt, and Ti-MAO-Htt
surfaces, respectively (Figure 2A), indicating that the MAO treatment increased the surface
roughness. The contact angle (CA) was 13.8 ± 1.7, 14.1 ±
1.5, 35.6 ± 2.2, 35.3 ± 1.8, 78.4 ± 4.1, and 77.8 ±
3.6° for the TLM-MAO-Htt, Ti-MAO-Htt, TLM-MAO, Ti-MAO, TLM-S,
and Ti-S surfaces, respectively (Figure 2B), which showed that the MAO and Htt processes
enhanced the surface coating hydrophilicity. Spectrum analysis of
surface elements (Figure 2C) showed that the Ca/P ratio in the TLM-MAO-Htt coating was
1.662, which was similar to that of bone tissue (1.67), while the
Ca/P ratio in the Ti-MAO-Htt coating was 1.557.

2.2 Bone Responses after Delayed Loading
All of the animals recovered quickly from the implant surgery, and
neither clinical signs of inflammation nor infections were observed.

After loading for 3 months in the mandibles of dogs, the TLM-MAO-Htt
implant showed greater BIC to BIT ratios than the Ti-MAO-Htt implant
(Table 1). As the histological
sections (Figure 3)
illustrate, bone absorption appeared on the superior margin of the
first thread of the Ti-MAO-Htt implant and on the inferior margin
of the first thread of the Ti-MAO-Htt implant. More osteocytes and
fewer osteoclasts were observed than on the TLM-MAO-Htt implant, while
a limited number of osteocytes and no osteoclasts were seen around
the Ti-MAO-Htt implants. Comparison of the Raman analysis at the cortical
level is shown in Figure 4, and compared to the data obtained without loading, the degree
of mineralization, carbonate content, and crystallinity increased
in the two groups. The carbonate content and crystallinity of the
TLM-MAO-Htt integrated bone were significantly higher than those of
the Ti-MAO-Htt integrated bone (Table 2).

After loading
for 3 months, the hardness and elastic modulus of
the integrated bone in the cortical bone area around the TLM-MAO-Htt
implant were significantly greater than those of the integrated bone
around the Ti-MAO-Htt implant (P ≤ 0.05) (Table 3). These results indicate
that the quality of the integrated bone remodeling surrounding the
TLM implants was better than that around the Ti implants. No obvious
space was observed via SEM between the bone and the implants in both
groups. However, the shadow on the bone side was more obvious and
less bone tissue appeared in the Ti-MAO-Htt group (Figure 5).

3 Discussion
An appropriate surface modification is widely
accepted as necessary
to improve the biocompatibility, bioactivity, and corrosion resistance
of biomaterials. In this study, MAO was used to provide a good combination
of porous oxide layers on β-type TLM, and then, nanoscale HA
particles were successfully incorporated over the porous coating via
Htt. We analyzed the surface physicochemical characteristics in vitro,
and a considerable number of homogeneous pores were observed on the
Ti-MAO and TLM-MAO surfaces, which was similar to the surface appearance
reported in a previous study.29,31 Htt did not change
the porous structure induced by MAO, and produced a nanosized crystalline
HA coating on the porous oxide layer, which was in agreement with
previous reports. Compared to the Ti-S implants, the TLM-MAO and Ti-MAO
implants exhibited significantly rougher and more hydrophilic surfaces.
The Ra decreased slightly after Htt, which
might be attributed to pits formed by the precipitation of nano-HA
occupying the mainly porous structure. The hydrophilicity was further
enhanced after the Htt process, and the hydrophilicity of the fabricated
coating on pure Ti was similar to that on the TLM surface. The surface
morphology of biomaterials has been shown to affect their osteoconductivity
in terms of osteocalcin production and ALPase activity.32 Bai et al.33 reported
that both the proliferation and ALP activity of MC3T3-E1 cells were
higher on MAO-treated substrates than on pure Ti substrates, and these
results were consistent with those on a TLM surface.29 Osteoblasts that adhered to an MAO surface had been shown
to exhibit a more flattened morphology, with cytoplasmatic extensions
that penetrated the pores and bridged a network bound to the porous
surface,34 which could provide a pathway
for cells to communicate and mature to a differentiated phenotype.35 An increase in surface roughness was known to
enhance the mechanical interlocking between an implant and bone to
improve the implant–bone bonding strength.36,37 Hydrophilic surfaces have substantial potential for promoting protein
adsorption and cellular responses, especially bone cell differentiation
and maturation, which are closely associated with direct bonding and
early stabilization of dental implants.38,39 HA has excellent
osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and angiogenic effects and stable
chemical properties, all of which contribute to osteointegration.40 The presence of an HA layer was suggested to
verify chemical bonding between bone and the biomaterials.41

In the present study, TLM and Ti implants
were subjected to the
same surface treatment and showed similar surface morphology properties.
The difference in the bone remodeling effects between the TLM and
Ti groups was primarily attributed to the difference in actual load
amount on the bone, which depended on the elastic modulus of the implant
material.

In vivo, histomorphological results showed active
bone remodeling
around the Ti implants, while relatively stable bone formation surrounded
the TLM implants, which was further revealed through the visible decrease
in the BIC and BIT values in the Ti-MAO-Htt group. The BIC% is defined
as the percentage of the length of newly mineralized bone in direct
contact with the surface of the implant threads.42 The BIT% is defined as the percentage of newly mineralized
bone volume inside all of the threads, which is similar to the BIC%
measurement. The higher BIC and BIT values observed in this study
indicated that the bone bonding and the amount of mineralized bone
deposited around the implants in the TLM-MAO-Htt group were significantly
greater than those in the Ti-MAO-Htt group.43 These previous findings might explain the results in the present
study indicating, that the β TLM alloy was beneficial to reducing
stress shielding and that the stress was not completely transferred
along the implant but homogeneously dispersed to the peri-implant
bone, which could stimulate bone regeneration, reshaping and strengthening
and avoid bone resorption back into the body.44,45 It showed that osteolysis in the neck of TLM implants was more seriously
destroyed than that of Ti ones. The stress almost concentrated on
the neck of implant, which induces overloading and bone resorption
in this area.4,45,46 The fact was very important since the load transfer from the implants
to bone was considered optimum to reduce the cervical bone resorption
caused by the stress shielding and overloading when the TLM implants
consisting of a β-titanium phase are characterized by a low
Young’s modulus closer to natural bone.47,48

Raman spectroscopy49 and nanoindentation
tests50 were carried out to further assess
the bone quality and mechanical properties of bone remodeling, respectively.
The quality of the bone tissue adjacent to implants plays an important
role in determining mechanical stability because the adjacent bone
tissue performs mechanical functions in implant systems.51,52 The mineral-to-matrix ratio increased in the TLM and Ti groups,
and the increase was more obvious in the TLM group than in the Ti
group, which was similar to the carbonate-to-phosphate ratio results,
showing that the extent of tissue mineral content and carbonate substitution
increased.53,54 These results suggest that bone
formed around the TLM-MAO-Htt implants was stronger than bone formed
around the Ti-MAO-Htt implants after 3 months of loading.55 The FWHM peak of the phosphate band was used
to indicate the mineral crystallinity, which was significantly higher
in the TLM-MAO-Htt group than in the Ti-MAO-Htt group. Crystallinity
is related to the mechanical properties of bone tissue, including
the modulus, yield stress, and fracture stress.56 Hardness and elastic modulus of bone tissue adjacent to
the interface were calculated by producing a loading–unloading
curve as a result of indentation.54,57 Nanoindentation
is an experimental technique widely used to test the mechanical properties
of bone specimens in vitro.51 For each
sample, three different bone were measured to reduce random errors
and five indentations were made for each region in the longitudinal
direction of bone tissue. The sites and directions of indentation
were also randomly selected. There are totally 15 indentations in
the cross section of per sample to get the average results. After
loading for 3 months, the hardness and elastic modulus of bone integrated
with the TLM-MAO-Htt implant were significantly greater than those
of bone integrated with the Ti-MAO-Htt implant (P ≤ 0.05). The mechanical properties of bone around the TLM
implants are significantly better than those of bone around the Ti
implant. It suggested that the TLM alloy implants with lower elastic
modulus enhanced the effect of bone remodeling in bone/implant interface,
which was consistent with the result observed by Zacchetti et al.,58 who showed that the quality of the trabecular
bone midway between two implants was increased when moderate mechanical
stimulation was applied to the tibiae of rats. Homogeneous transmission
of the functional stress was beneficial for bone formation and remodeling.44,59 A large mismatch of the modulus between the bone and implant can
also lead to micromotion and negatively affect the stress distribution
at the bone–implant interface, which induces the bone atrophy
and mineralization and decreases implant stability.4,60,61

Our study has several limitations.
We supposed that the sample
was an isotropic solid in this study, but it did not correspond to
the anisotropy and heterogeneity of bone. We also lack considerations
that may affect the results, such as hydration testing condition of
sample and changeable Poisson’s ratio of different bone samples
and orientations. Further studies looking specifically at aspects
of the comparability and reliability of this technique are required
to establish optimal method for the measurement of bone mechanical
property. Poor tribology and corrosion resistance of biomedical coating
also limit its clinical application in implants. To improve these
properties, a Ca–P-containing coating were prepared on metal
surface via MAO processes in recent work.20,21,28,62 Sobolev et
al. reported that corrosion resistance of the protective oxide coating
on MAO-treated Ti-6AL-4V specimens was 20 times higher than the untreated
sample by a potentiodynamic polarization test in NaCl solution.63 It is of great significance to study the delamination
of biomedical coating, but an experiment involving this aspect was
not carried out. Similar conclusions were reported commonly that the
ceramic MAO and HA layer linked tightly with the metal substrates
due to the physical interaction (e.g., surface roughness and small
grain of the substrate) and chemical bonding between titanium and
coating.31,64−66 Further studies are
necessary to verify the interfacial bonding strength between coating
and substrate and to investigate the long-term friction together with
tribocorrosion behavior of the biomaterial under severe exposed conditions
and loading for implant applications.

In clinic, the ultimate
goal of dental implants is to perform masticatory
function. It is a key to exhibit stable and reliable osseointegration
between the implant materials and surrounding bone under load-bearing
condition. This can be expectedly achieved through the use of low-elastic-modulus
biomedical materials, for example, the approximate β-type TLM
alloy coated with multiporous layer by MAO technique.

4 Conclusions
MAO and Htt generated a hybrid, rough, hydrophilic
coating, which
achieved osteointegration after implantation into the mandible of
Beagles. In a loading experiment, the effect of bone remodeling around
the TLM implants was significantly improved compared to that around
the Ti implants. Within the limitations of this study, the following
conclusions can be drawn:1. The microarc oxidation combination
with hydrothermal process is an excellent surface modification technique
to enhance the surface bioactivity on Ti–5Zr–3Sn–5Mo–25Nb
(TLM) alloys.

2. Low-intrinsic-elasti-modulus
TLM alloy
exhibited desirable biomechanical compatibility in vivo. Therefore,
it is promising to be an appropriate candidate biomaterial applied
to load-bearing dental implants.



5 Materials and Methods
5.1 Sample Preparation
All of the titanium
and TLM alloys were provided by Northwest Nonferrous Metal Research
Institute (Northwest Institute for Non-ferrous Metal Research, China).
A TLM titanium alloy, which was approximate to a β-type or titanium
alloy, was used as the substrate material and base material for the
implants. Prior to the MAO process, the specimens were increasingly
ground with 200–2000 grit abrasive paper and then dried for
further use. The following three groups of plates were prepared and
characterized: (1) TLM-MAO-Htt: TLM titanium alloy subjected to MAO
treatment that has been described in previous studies,67 followed by Htt at 200°C for 4 h to prepare
MAO-Htt-treated samples, as described in previous studies;68 (2) Ti-MAO-Htt: pure titanium treated via MAO
and Htt; and (3) Ti-S: smooth, pure titanium without surface coating
treatment. Pure Ti and TLM plates (⌀15 mm × 1 mm) were
cut with a lining-cutting machine and used for surface characterization
and in vitro cell studies. Cylindrical implants with a diameter of
4.1 mm and a length of 8 mm were designed for the in vivo experiment.

5.2 Physicochemical Characterization of the Coatings
The surface morphology and elemental composition of the coatings
were examined by a field emission scanning electron microscope (Nova
Nano-SEM 230) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer.
The surface average roughness (Ra) and
contact angle (CA) of the specimens were analyzed using a surface
profiler (SURFCOM 2800E) and a video contact angle measurement system
(Phoenix-300), respectively. The phase compositions of the samples
were analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (X’Pert Pro MPD).

5.3 Surgical Procedure
All animal procedures
were approved by the IACUC of Chongqing Medical University, China,
and conducted in accordance with the principles of medical ethics.

Four adult male beagles (weight of 13.87 ± 2.33 kg, 1 year
old) were used in the mandible dental implantation experiments. Animals
were housed in individual cages in an air-conditioned room with free
access to water and food and an artificial 12/12 h day/night cycle.
The animals were allowed to acclimate for 1 week prior to surgery.
The dogs were randomly numbered. Before all operations, the animals
were intramuscularly anesthetized with ketamine (40 mg/kg) and locally
anesthetized with articaine. Animals were then placed on a sterile
drape to provide sterile conditions during surgery. Supra- and subgingival
scalings were performed 2 weeks prior to surgery. A dentition defect
model was established through bilateral extraction of four premolars
from the mandible of the dogs. After a 3 months wound-healing period,
three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) images of the jaws with
the dentition defects were used to ensure the implant conditions.
Three implant holes (⌀4.1 mm × 8 mm) were drilled at each
lateral edentulous area, followed by dental implantation. The implant
site obeyed the Latin distribution.69 The
implants were placed in a direction that allowed occlusion with the
upper dentition, and two groups of implants (three TLM-MAO-Htt on
the left and three Ti-MAO-Htt on the right) were placed in the defect
region. All of the implants were restored by placement of a full metal
crown 3 months after implantation that formed light occlusion with
the upper dentition to simulate an intraoral load-bearing environment
for 3 months. Then, the dogs were sacrificed by external carotid vein
exsanguination and the bilateral mandibles with implants were harvested.

5.3.1 Sample Preparation
Specimens were
longitudinally sectioned from the major axis with a hard tissue microtome
(Leitz 1600, Germany). The mesial half of every implant was used to
obtain hard tissue slices with a thickness of 30 μm for bone
histological and histomorphological analyses. Additionally, the sections
were stained with methylene blue and basic fuchsin stain to quantitatively
assess new bone formation and peri-implant osseointegration. Meanwhile,
the distal half of sections was ground and polished to obtain a smooth
surface and then ultrasonically cleaned for Raman analysis (Renishaw,
U.K.) and the nanoindentation experiment (Agilent). Four samples were
randomly selected from each group and 8–10 tissue sites per
specimen were selected for Raman analysis of the cortical bone adjacent
to the implant threads; five sites in three regions per sample (the
same samples used for Raman analysis) were selected for nanoindentation
analysis.

5.3.2 Histological Examination
Histological
examination was performed under a light microscope (OLYMPUS, Japan)
equipped with a camera (Canon550D, Japan). BIC was defined as the
sum ratio of the implant length in direct contact with new bone tissue
and the total length of the implant adjacent to native bone. BIT was
defined as the percentage of newly formed bone volume inside all of
the threads between the implant and the cancellous bone. Image-Pro
Plus6.0 (IPP6.0) microscopy image analysis software was used to analyze
the data.

5.3.3 Raman Spectrum Analysis
Raman spectra
were obtained using a standard confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw,
U.K.) with a 785 nm semiconductor laser at 50 mW for 10 s, a frequency
range of 200–2000 cm–1, and a spectral resolution
of 2 cm–1 through a 20× long working distance
objective. Multiple spectra of the same sample were integrated to
represent relative Raman spectrum signal intensities in a mapped sample
region. The featured baseline was subtracted from all spectra, which
were then deconvolved via Lorentzian functions to obtain specific
parameters, such as the amplitude, area, and wavenumber. The raw peak
intensities for the three different bone minerals were calculated
as follows: the PO43–ν1 (960 cm–1)/amide I (1667 cm–1) peak area
ratio; the carbonate CO32– (1070 cm–1)/PO43–ν1 (960
cm–1) ratio; and the full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) PO4ν1 peak.

5.3.4 Nanoindentation
Test
Nanoindentation
tests were performed using a G200 Nano Tester (Agilent) with a displacement
resolution below 0.01 nm and a maximum indentation depth of 500 m.
Diamond Berkovich indenters were employed based on a continuous stiffness-measuring
technology. A maximal load of 500 mN was applied on the surfaces for
50 s during the indentation load nanoindentation tests. The slope
of the unloading force–displacement curve was recorded and
analyzed, after which the average hardness and modulus were determined
from the depth region of the unloading portion of the curve between
200 and 2000 nm. The assumed Poisson’s ratio for bone is 0.3.
The Young’s modulus E and hardness H of the specimen were then computed through the relationship
described by Oliver and Pharr.70 The E and H values in the cortical bone region
were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the peri-implant
integrated bone.

5.4 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analyses were conducted with SPSS 18.0. The quantitative data were
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X̅ ± SD). Statistical analysis was performed with one-way analysis
of variance. The Kruskal–Wallis H-test was
used to compare the average values of multiple independent parameters.
Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
