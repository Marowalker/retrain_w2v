The
structure of the xanthates’ hydrocarbon (C–H)
chain is one of the major factors which affect flotation recovery.
The effectiveness and the collecting power of xanthates increase with
increasing chain length and vary depending on the chain structure:
branched and straight chains. In this regard, the influences of length
(2–5 carbon) and structure (straight: normal and branched:
iso) of xanthate’s hydrocarbon chain on flotation recovery
of galena were investigated under different experimental conditions:
xanthate concentration, conditioning time, air flow rate (AFR), and
air bubble size. Because of the steric effects of the chain structure,
the branched chain xanthates gave lower flotation recoveries with
shorter conditioning times compared to those with straight chain xanthates.
Over-conditioning with straight chain xanthates resulted in hydrophobic
aggregation of galena particles which resulted in the detachment of
galena particles from air bubbles due to increasing weight, leading
to lower flotation recoveries. In the case of flotation with different
AFRs, the flotation recoveries increased with increasing AFR to 7
lph and further increase in AFR (10 lph) negatively affected the flotation
recoveries when particles had insufficient hydrophobic surfaces. The
maximum flotation recoveries were obtained with the addition of MIBC
(methyl isobutyl carbinol) as a frother; the size of the air bubbles
deceased with increasing MIBC concentration which increased higher
encounter/collision probability of air bubbles with galena particles,
resulting in higher flotation recoveries.

1 Introduction
Lead is defined as a chalcophile element according to Goldschmidt’s
classification. Chalcophile elements are elements such as Zn, Pb,
As, Sb, Ag, Hg, Cd, and so forth which preferentially bond with sulfur
to form sulfides.1 Thus, lead is rarely
present in the environment in its free form. Instead, it is generally
found in combination with other elements in the form of minerals.
Galena (PbS) and its oxidized forms cerussite (PbCO3) and
anglesite (PbSO4) are the most common forms of lead in
the earth’s crust. Of these minerals, galena has the highest
lead content, and it coexists in nature with sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite
(CuFeS2), pyrite (FeS2), quartz (SiO2), calcite (CaCO3), fluorite (CaF2), silver,
and so forth, thus, froth flotation can be applied selectively in
order to obtain high-grade concentrates.2,3

Sulfide
minerals are weakly polar due to their covalent bonding,
which makes their surfaces hydrophobic when they have freshly crushed/ground
surfaces. Thus, sulfide minerals having fresh and less oxidized surfaces
show natural floatability and readily float without a collector.4,5 The natural floatability of sulfide minerals under appropriate conditions
has been reported in the descending order as chalcopyrite > galena
> pyrrhotite > sphalerite > pyrite > arsenopyrite.6,7 However,
the hydrophobic behavior of their surfaces, and thus the flotation
recovery responses in the presence/absence of xanthates, decreases
with surface oxidation. Oxidation often occurs when minerals are exposed
to open atmosphere and/or an aqueous environment during mining and
mineral-processing operations.8−10 The oxidation rates of sulfide
minerals in air and aqueous solutions have been visualized by scanning
electron microscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning auger
microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and so forth.11−14 From these experiments, the oxidation
rate of galena was found to be less than that of chalcopyrites and
pyrites.15 Even though sulfide minerals
with fresh surfaces may easily float and/or rapid oxidation on their
surfaces may prevent flotation (i.e. galena), the hydrophobicity is
mostly enhanced by the use of xanthates.4,16

Among
the numerous factors which affect the collecting power of
xanthates,17 the structure of nonpolar
(C–H) chain plays a crucial role during selective separation
of sulfide minerals by flotation.18 If
the ore contains multiple sulfide minerals, two strategies can be
applied for the recovery of sulfide minerals. In the first case, as
the collecting power of the xanthates increases with increasing C–H
chain length,18 the long chain xanthates
are preferentially selected to collect all sulfide minerals as a bulk
concentrate. Furthermore, upgrading of an ore having finely ground
sulfide minerals can be possible with the use of long-chain xanthates,
resulting in better flotation recovery by inducing aggregation and
hydrophobization of the fine sulfide particles.19−21 In the second
case, if selectivity is more important than flotation recovery alone,
the less powerful xanthate derivatives are selected in order to form
separate concentrates at successive flotation stages.18 In either case, the selection of C–H chain length
is generally limited to 2–5 carbon atoms because xanthates
with longer chain lengths have much lower solubility in an aqueous
environment than xanthates with shorter chain lengths. Therefore,
the use of xanthates with longer chains results in a decrease in the
concentration of xanthate species adsorbed on mineral surfaces. The
structure of C–H chain is another important factor, which affects
the flotation recovery and selective separation of sulfide minerals.
It indirectly affects the adsorption capability of a xanthate on the
mineral surface, thus promoting the floatability of mineral particles.
For example, the adsorption capabilities of iso-xanthates
with branched chains on mineral surfaces have been reported to be
much higher than n-xanthates having straight chains.17

Broadly speaking, this problem has attracted
a lot of attention
in the field of mineral processing. However, most of the earlier studies
have focused on the usage of xanthates for the recovery of single
or multisulfide minerals from sulfide ores in ideal flotation conditions.
One of the major aims of this study, therefore, was to analyze and
investigate the effects of hydrocarbon chain length (2–5 carbon
atoms) and hydrocarbon chain structure (straight chain and branched
chain) of xanthates to contribute to a greater understanding of the
flotation recovery of galena. Furthermore, the effects of different
variables, such as collector concentration, conditioning time, air
flow rate (AFR), and air bubble size on flotation recovery of galena
were also investigated in the presence of each xanthate with different
chain lengths and structures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Collector Concentration on Flotation
Recovery
Xanthates are the salts of xanthic acid (alkyl/aryl
dithiocarbonic acid) and are formed through the replacement of two
oxygen atoms in carbonic acid by sulfur and replacement of one hydrogen
atom by an alkyl/aryl group.22 They are
commonly used as a standard collector for sulfide minerals, and their
collecting power varies with C–H chain length and the C–H
chain structure they carry. This part of the study therefore aimed
to compare the effects of xanthate concentration (1–50 ppm)
on flotation recovery of galena, with variations depending in the
hydrocarbon chain (2–5 carbon) and hydrocarbon chain structure
(straight and branched chain) of xanthates (PEX, SIPX, SIBX, and PAX).
The microflotation tests were conducted below the critical micelle
concentration of each collector at four different pH values between
highly acidic and alkaline conditions (pH 2–11.5), a function
of concerned parameters (Table 1), at ambient temperature. The zeta potential values and the
collector concentration versus flotation recovery profiles of microflotation
tests are given in Figures 1 and 2a–d, respectively.

In Figure 1, the
results show that the zeta potential values of galena in water vary
depending on pH. It shows slightly positive zeta potentials at highly
acidic values and shows negative zeta potential values through alkaline
pHs with increasing magnitude by displaying isoelectric point (pHiep) at about pH 2.8. In the case of microflotation tests,
the results given in Figure 2a–d show that the flotation recovery galena increases
with increasing collector concentration at certain pH values and changes
depending on the chain length and chain structure of the xanthate
used. While the minimum flotation recoveries were obtained at highly
alkaline pH values (pH > 11) for each xanthate, the highest flotation
recoveries were obtained at moderately alkaline pH conditions (pH
9–9.5) with straight-chain xanthates (over 90% with PEX and
PAX). Because of the shape factor that governs the effectiveness of
adsorption of xanthates on the surface, the molecules with branched
or ring chains showed tendencies to poorer adsorption layer formation
as compared to straight-chain xanthates. Therefore, the flotation
recoveries obtained with branched-chain xanthates (over 65% with SIBX
and over 55% with SIPX) were found to be less than those with straight-chain
xanthates.

It is worth mentioning here that prior to the microflotation
tests
with each collector, the microflotation tests were first performed
in distilled water in order to determine the natural floatability
of the galena sample. According to the results, after cleaning and
drying stages, the mineral surfaces were oxidized, resulting in less
than 10% flotation recoveries over the entire pH range. It is also
worth indicating that the reactions between sulfide minerals and xanthates
are complex, and many mechanisms have been proposed.17,23 Xanthates are assumed to adsorb mostly by irreversible chemical
bonds to the sulfide mineral surface with the OCSS group in the polar
heads24−26 forming insoluble metal xanthates with a high degree
of hydrophobicity16 which changes depending
on the metallic compounds that exist on the mineral surface.17 The species distribution diagram of Pb ion as
a function of pH given in Figure 3a shows that Pb2+ is found dominantly as
Pb2+ in the acidic–neutral pH range and predominantly
as Pb(OH)+ in the neutral–basic (pH 7.5–9.5)
pH range. Their concentrations decrease while the concentrations of
Pb(OH)2 and Pb(OH)3– increase
with increasing pH. Moreover, xanthates consist of anionic monomers
(X–) dominated at neutral–alkaline pH conditions.
The monomer concentrations of xanthates, and thus their collecting
ability, decrease with decreasing pH at neutral–acidic pH values
where xanthates hydrolyze to form xanthic acid (HX) and form dixanthogene
when exposed to an open atmosphere (Figure 3b).27

Considering
the species distribution diagrams given in Figure 3a,b, and the zeta
potential values of galena given in Figure 1, the high flotation recoveries of galena
at 2–2.5 pH (Figure 2a) were mostly caused by Coulombic forces: the interaction
between oppositely charged xanthate species (X–)
and mineral surfaces (Pb2+). With increasing pH, the magnitude
of negative zeta potential values of galena increased and the concentration
of Pb2+ in the pulp decreased which resulted in lower flotation
recoveries especially for PEX, SIPX, and SIBX in the pH range of 6–6.5
(Figure 2b). Galena
had increasing stability of surface charge with increasing pH and
displayed net negative zeta potentials (−30 mV) at pH 9–9.5,
and the xanthate dominated as ionic monomers (X–) in the pulp. Even so, the flotation recoveries with each collector
increased to maximum values at given pH values. The results indicated
that an adsorption occurred between galena and each xanthate sample
was mostly by the chemical interaction of xanthate monomers24,25 with Pb(OH)+. However, a further increase in pH (>pH
11) resulted in the minimum flotation recoveries (<15% with PEX,
SIPX, and SIBX) even in the presence of the highest collector concentration
used. The pH-dependent flotation recovery results in this study were
similar to those obtained by Ma et al., 2017.28

distribution diagram of (a) Pb2+29 and (b) xanthate.27,30

According to the molecular orbital theory proposed first
by Fukui
et al., 1952,31 the energy gap (ΔE) between the highest occupation molecular orbital (HOMO)
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is considered an
important stability index. The higher the gap, the higher the stability
of a molecule and the lower the reactivity.32,33 The results given in Table 2 showed that when two straight-chain xanthates were compared,
PAX, having higher ΔEHOMO–LUMO value, displayed higher reactivity than PEX. Similarly, SIBX displayed
higher reactivity value than SIPX when branched-chain xanthates were
compared. These results were compatible with the flotation recovery
results obtained. The lower HOMO and higher LUMO values of PEX and
SIPX indicated that they had a weaker ability to donate and accept
electrons as compared to the abilities of PAX and SIBX. Furthermore,
the results also indicated that an increase of the alkyl in the carbon
chain resulted in an increase in reactivity, which was similar to
the results obtained in the zinc oxide flotation using an amine collector.33 The lower flotation recoveries seen in the presence
of i-xanthates compared to those with n-xanthates might be due to the greater steric hindrance caused by
the branched structure, resulting in the lower surface coverage on
the mineral surface and thereby lower hydrophobicity.34

2.2 Effect of Conditioning Time on Flotation Recovery
The success of the flotation process is largely determined by the
interaction of xanthates with the target mineral particles and is
mainly dependent on the characteristics of the xanthate and mineral,
pH, conditioning time, collector concentration, and so forth.35 Thus, in order to determine the effect of conditioning
time on flotation recovery, the flotation recovery responses of galena
with 2.5–10 min conditioning intervals were investigated in
the presence of 2.5 ppm collector concentration (100 mL) above neutral
pH conditions, with over variables held constant. The results of flotation
tests are shown in Figure 4a–c for 2.5, 5, and 10 min conditioning intervals.

The results given in Figure 4a–c show that flotation recoveries of galena can change
depending on the conditioning time, pH, and collector chain structure.
From the results obtained, the conditioning time had a marked effect
on the collector uptake, and the maximum flotation recoveries were
obtained above pH 7 and dropped rapidly through highly alkaline pH
values. For 2.5 min of conditioning, the maximum flotation recoveries
were about 20% with SIPX, 25% with SIBX, and 35% with PEX and above
50% with PAX. The adsorption capabilities of each xanthate on galena
increased with increasing conditioning time as reported by Aktas et
al., 2008,36 which resulted in approximately
10–15% higher flotation recoveries after 5 min of conditioning.
Up to 5 min of conditioning, the straight-chain xanthates (PEX and
PAX) provided higher flotation recoveries than branched-chain xanthates
(SIPX and SIBX). However, longer conditioning time (10 min) had a
slightly negative influence on the flotation recoveries obtained with
the straight-chain xanthates, while the flotation recovery values
with SIPX and SIBX enhanced more than those obtained with 5 min of
conditioning. It has been previously reported by Kuopanportti et al.,
200035 that the adsorption of xanthates
on a mineral surface is a rapid process and takes place in a few minutes.
Thus, overconditioning in the presence of straight chain xanthates
resulted in hydrophobic aggregation of galena particles. Then, the
galena particles detached easily from the air bubbles due to the increasing
weight of aggregated particles, resulting in lower flotation recoveries.

Figure 4 Flotation
recovery of galena after (a) 2.5, (b) 5, and (c) 10 min
of conditioning steps.

In the case of branched chain xanthates, the steric hindrance
caused
by the branched structure of SIPX and SIBX negatively affected interactions
of xanthate species with the galena surface. Thus, the shorter conditioning
time intervals (2.5 and 5 min) resulted in lower flotation recoveries,
whereas the longer conditioning time (10 min) enhanced adsorption
capability of branched chain xanthates which therefore indirectly
prevented them to aggregate, resulting in higher flotation recoveries.

2.3 Effect of AFR on Flotation Recovery
In
the flotation process, air bubbles are primarily responsible for
carrying the hydrophobic mineral particles to froth zone and then
transferring them over the flotation cell lip. A higher number of
air bubbles in the flotation cell increases the encounter/collision
probability of particles with air bubbles, which increases with increasing
AFR. Hence, this part of the study aimed to investigate the effect
of AFR on flotation recovery of galena with different AFRs between
4 and 10 lph using 2.5 ppm collector concentration (100 mL) above
neutral pH conditions. According to the results given in Figure 5a–c, the minimum flotation recoveries of galena were
obtained with AFR of 4 lph. As the AFR increased from 4 to 7 lph (Figure 5a,b), the number
of air bubbles and thus the flotation recoveries increased to maximum
values over 80% flotation recoveries for PEX, SIBX, and PAX, as was
expected. However, a further increase in AFR to 10 lph resulted in
the lowest flotation recoveries obtained (<40%) for each xanthate
used (Figure 5c). The
results were consistent with the results obtained by Gursoy and Oteyaka,
2015.37

Figure 5 Flotation recovery of galena in the presence
of 2.5 ppm with (a)
4, (b) 7, and (c) 10 lph of AFRs.

AFR has also a significant impact on bubble size and the
probability
of coalescence of air bubbles. The air bubble sizes formed due to
the higher AFR were reported to be much bigger than that obtained
with slower AFR for the same test conditions.38,39 Furthermore, it is also worth mentioning here that the velocities
of the rising air bubbles increase with the bubble diameter,40,41 resulting in higher drag forces.42,43 Therefore,
from the results obtained without methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC),
it might be suggested that as the size of air bubbles increased, their
rising velocities also increased, leading to the detachment of insufficiently
hydrophobic galena particles (with the use of 2.5 ppm xanthate). This
occurred when the detachment forces exceeded the adhesive forces.
The other forces which negatively affected the flotation recoveries
might also be the unstable conditions by oscillation,41,44 coalescence of air bubbles,45 and/or
helical action of the air bubbles while they were rising up.

Considering previously obtained flotation recovery responses of
galena with each xanthate, a further investigation was also performed
in order to determine the effect of higher AFR (10 lph) on flotation
recovery of galena conditioned in the presence of the higher xanthate
concentration (25 ppm). According to the results given in Figure 6, the flotation recovery values obtained clearly indicated
that when galena particles had sufficiently hydrophobic surfaces,
their attachment to air bubbles was stronger than that with lower
xanthate concentrations (Figure 7). This, therefore, resulted in much higher flotation
recoveries even with higher AFR (10 lph) compared to those obtained
with low xanthate concentrations (Figure 5c).

of 25 ppm xanthate

2.4 Effect of Air Bubble Size
on Flotation Recovery
Frothers are added to the pulp when
the surfaces of the target
mineral particles have been rendered hydrophobic after conditioning
with an appropriate flotation collector. They play an important role
in flotation by building up small and stable air bubbles46,47 which are responsible for carrying the hydrophobic particles to
the froth zone. It has been reported that the amount of frother and
the air bubble diameter are inversely proportional to each other and
that the air bubble size decreases with increasing frother concentration.48−51 Considering the fact that xanthates containing less than 6 carbon
atoms do not exhibit frothing properties;52 in this part of the study, the effect of air bubble size formed
by frother addition (0.8–4 ppm of MIBC) on the flotation recovery
of galena was investigated in the presence of each xanthate sample.
The tests were applied using 2.5 ppm xanthate concentration (100 mL)
and 4 lph AFR. The Hallimond tube images are given in Figures 8 (no/0.8 ppm of MIBC) and Figure 9 (4 ppm of MIBC),
and their corresponding flotation recovery results are presented in Figure 10.

and (c) 4 ppm MIBC.

The efficiency of the
flotation process is accomplished mainly
by three stages: encounter/collision of particles and air bubbles,
attachment of particles on air bubbles, and detachment.53 In Figures 8 and 9, the Hallimond tube images
show that air bubbles sizes decrease with increasing concentration
of MIBC addition. According to Yoon and Luttrell, 1989,54 Tao’s (2004)53 fundamental analysis and, Sobhy and Tao, 2013,55 it was indicated that the mineral particle–air bubble
collision probability with smaller air bubbles is higher than that
with larger ones under similar conditions. It was also indicated that
the detachment probability of particles from air bubbles decreases
with decreasing size of the air bubbles. Furthermore, the smaller
the air bubble sizes, the lower their rising velocity, resulting in
longer residence time in the flotation cell.

According to the
results given in Figure 10, the maximum flotation recoveries with
each xanthate were obtained below pH 9.5. With the addition of 0.8
ppm of MIBC, nearly 60% and 80% of the galena test sample were recovered
with PEX and PAX respectively while the flotation recoveries increased
over 90% for both straight-chain xanthates with the addition of 4
ppm of MIBC. In the case of branched-chain xanthates, the effect of
bubble size on flotation recoveries was much more effective than it
was with straight-chain xanthates. The flotation recoveries with the
addition of MIBC increased gradually from about 35% to over 80% with
SIPX and from 40% to over 90% with SIBX. Thus, with decreasing air
bubble size in a flotation cell, the residence time and total surface
area of air bubbles per unit time increased, leading to both higher
collision probability of air bubbles with galena particles and carrying
of a single galena particle by multiple air bubbles (Figure 9e). It was also reported by
Leja and Schulman, 195456 that the addition
of frother enhanced the interaction of the bubble with mineral particles,
leading to stronger and faster attachment. The flotation recoveries
of galena with 2.5 ppm of each xanthate sample, therefore, increased
gradually with increasing MIBC concentration (Figure 10a–c) compared to those without MIBC.

3 Conclusions
On the basis of this study, the
following conclusions can be made
regarding the effects of C–H length and structure of xanthates
on flotation recovery of galena under various experimental conditions:

The flotation recovery of galena varied with C–H chain length
and structure of xanthate, xanthate concentration, and pH. Observed
steric effects due to the branched-chain structure of xanthates (SIPX
and SIBX) decreased their interaction rate with the galena surface
which prevented the hydrophobic aggregation of galena particles even
with longer conditioning time (10 min). Thus, branched-chain xanthates
resulted in the higher flotation recovery values compared to those
obtained with straight-chain xanthates (PEX and PAX) causing hydrophobic
aggregation of galena particles for the over-conditioning times.

AFR had a crucial effect on flotation recovery of galena. The observed
flotation recoveries increased to the maximum values obtained and
then dropped sharply with further increase in AFR (10 lph). However,
for the same experimental conditions much higher flotation recoveries
with higher AFRs were obtained with the addition of MIBC.

The
flotation recoveries seen with branched-chain xanthates were
affected more by the air bubble size than straight-chain xanthates.
The maximum flotation recoveries were obtained depending on both the
presence and concentration of MIBC which increased higher encounter/collision
probability of air bubbles with galena particles and lead to stronger
and faster attachment, resulting in higher flotation recoveries.

4 Materials and Methods
The high quality galena sample
used in this experiment was obtained
from the Dursunbey/Balıkesir region in Turkey. The sample was
wet-screened and rinsed with dilute HCl solution to clean the surface
of mineral particles. Then, the galena sample was rinsed again with
distilled water and dried in an oven for 48 h. The −106 + 75
μm-sized
sample was used in microflotation studies in order to minimize the
effect of particle size on flotation recovery. According to results
of X-ray fluorescence analysis, the sample has over 73% Pb with minor
quantities (>3%) of sphalerite, pyrite, and chalcopyrite.

The number of isomers of xanthates varies and increases with increasing
chain length.17,28 The most common and important
xanthates are found in forms with both straight chains (n-xanthates) (Figure 11a,b) and branched chains (iso (i)-xanthates) (Figure 11c,d). The collector samples in this study were obtained from ECS
mining chemical company depending on their chain length and structure
as potassium ethyl xanthate (K-EX; PEX), sodium isopropyl xanthate
(Na-IPX; SIPX), sodium isobutyl xanthate (Na-IBX; SIBX), and potassium
amyl xanthate (K-AX; PAX). Their molecular structures and molecular
orbitals were calculated by the Gaussian 09 program57 using geometry optimization at the HF/6-31G(D) level. The
visual molecular dynamics graphics tool58−60 was used to build each
collector.

xanthates)
and (c,d) branched hydrocarbon chains (iso-propyl
and iso-butyl xanthates).

Prior to the analyses, 250 ppm of stock solutions were prepared
freshly by dissolving each collector sample in distilled water and
diluted by adding distilled water to the desired collector concentrations
(1–50 ppm/L) before use. MIBC was used as a frother, and the
pH conditions were adjusted by using dilute HCl and NaOH solutions.

4.1 Zeta Potential Measurement and Microflotation
Tests
The zeta potential values (ζ) of the galena particles
were measured at ambient temperatures with the Malvern Zetasizer Nano-Z
meter. The instrument measures the zeta potential of the particles
having size range of 5 nm to 10 μm using a laser doppler velocimeter.
For the zeta potential measurement, 10 mg of representative mineral
sample (−10 μm) was stirred in 100 mL of distilled water
for 5 min after pH adjustment, and the pulp was then transferred to
a Zetasizer sample cell for the measurement. An average potential
of 3 measurements was taken as a zeta potential value.

Microflotation
tests were done using the Hallimond tube microflotation test apparatus,
which was assembled in the depicted configuration (Figure 12). The pulp of 100 mL, constituting
1 g of mineral sample, chemical compounds, and distilled water, was
conditioned at the target pH and surfactant conditions by a stirrer
with adjustable conditioning and placed into a Hallimond tube. Next,
a microflotation test was performed at constant stirrer speed, AFR,
and bubble collecting time period. Flotation recovery under various
flotation conditions was then calculated by weighing the filtered
and dried concentrate and tailing.
