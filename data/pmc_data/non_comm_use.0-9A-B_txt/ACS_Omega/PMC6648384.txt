This work reports electronic excitation
energies of neutral and
charged oligothiophenes (OTn) with repeat
unit n = 2–6 computed by routinely used semiempirical
and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods. More
specifically, for OTn, OTn+, and OTn–, we calculated
vertical transition energies for electronic absorption spectroscopy
employing the Zerner’s version of intermediate neglect differential
overlap method for structures optimized by the PM6 semiempirical method
and the TD-DFT method with three different functionals, B3LYP, BVP86,
and M06-2X, for structures optimized by the ground-state DFT method
employing the same functionals. We also calculated vertical transition
energies for the emission spectroscopy from the lowest singlet excited
states by employing the TD-DFT method for the structures optimized
for the lowest singlet excited states. In addition to computational
results in vacuum, solution phase data calculated at the level of
polarizable continuum model are reported and compared with available
experimental data. Most of the data are fitted reasonably well by
two simple model functions, one based on a Frenkel exciton theory
and the other based on the model of independent electrons in a box
with sinusoidal modulation of potential. Despite similar levels of
fitting performance, the two models produce distinctively different
asymptotic values of excitation energies. Comparison of these with
available experimental and computational data suggests that the values
based on the exciton model, while seemingly overestimating, are closer
to true values than those based on the other model. This assessment
is confirmed by additional calculations for a larger oligomer. The
fitting parameters offer new means to understand the relationship
between electronic excitations of OTs and their sizes and suggest
the feasibility of constructing simple coarse-grained exciton-bath
models applicable for aggregates of OTs.

==== Body
I Introduction
It
is widely recognized that organic conjugated polymers (CPs)
and oligomers (COs) serve as unique optoelectronic materials thanks
to their rich and highly tunable optical/electronic properties.1−5 Remarkable progress has been made in the application of such properties,
e.g., for organic light-emitting diodes6−9 and field-effect transistors.2,10−12 As yet, there remains ample possibility for further
advances in their utilization, through more satisfactory characterization
and control of the electronic properties. For example, while significant
progress has been made in the utilization of CPs for organic photovoltaic
(OPV) devices employing bulk heterojunction morphology,13 their efficiencies are not sufficient for large-scale
commercialization yet. Major factors contributing to the electronic
excitation and charge mobility of CPs/COs need to be characterized
better, which are essential for developing new advanced morphologies
promoting more efficient migration of excitons and charge carriers
in OPV devices.14 Accurate theoretical
understanding of the spectroscopy of CPs/COs is an important step
in achieving this goal.

Polythiophene (PT) and its derivatives
are among the earliest components
used for OPV devices and have been tested extensively.15 This is due to their relatively good charge
hole mobility and ease of chemical modification/material processing.16 Another reason is that high polarizability of
sulfur in thiophene rings stabilizes conjugation of π-bonds
and promotes charge transport capability significantly. Although the
efficiencies of OPV devices utilizing PTs are not among the highest
ones at present, they remain highly robust systems available to date.
In addition, an OPV device utilizing a related molecule, benzodithiophene
polymer (PTB7), was shown to exhibit about 7.4% energy conversion
efficiency.17 Recently synthesized polymers
constituting organic photovoltaic devices,18,19 which can attain about 10% efficiency, are partly based on thiophene
units as well. Thus, thiophene-based oligomers/polymers are expected
to still serve as important active components for potentially more
efficient OPV devices that may be available in the future.

PTs
or related CPs, which are typically employed as OPV materials,
have at least hundreds of repeat units. However, direct ab initio
calculation of such large molecules with reasonable accuracy is still
difficult, let alone their aggregates that ultimately need to be investigated
for accurate characterization of electronic properties of OPV materials.11,15 In practice, computational studies have been conducted for oligothiophenes
(OTs), from which properties of PTs can be extrapolated.20−25 The computational methods that have been employed for studying OTs
range from semiempirical21,24,26−31 to ab initio methods at various levels of approximation.20,24,32−39

Earlier computational studies of excitation energies in large
molecules
mostly used Zerner’s version of intermediate neglect differential
overlap (ZINDO) method.40,41 More recently, the
time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method42 has become a popular tool due to its modest
computational cost and reasonable accuracy. TD-DFT tends to overestimate
the electronic correlation for long oligomers.43 However, errors can be reduced through judicious choice
of functionals and methods to correct self-interaction error,24,37,43−47 although identifying a reliable scheme applicable
to all major spectroscopic data remains challenging.47 More recently, many-body perturbation theory approaches
such as Green’s function with GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter
equation (BSE) have emerged as new promising computational tools.38,48,49

Even at the level of simple
computational methods and small OTs,
a comprehensive set of data comparing their accuracy against well-established
experimental results are not easy to find. Such data set can help
assess the performance of computational methods and establish simple
correction schemes applicable to more complex and larger systems.
Motivated by this need, in this work, we report results based on a
computational study of OTn and its charged
species, OTn+ and OTn–, with the repeat unit of n = 2–6. For these,
relatively well-established experimental data are available. We here
consider simple computational methods only, which are the ZINDO method40,41 and the TD-DFT method42 based on three
functionals with distinctively different Hartree–Fock contributions,50 B3LYP,51,52 BVP86,53−55 and M06-2X.56 Although the scope of computational
methods considered here is limited, the analysis presented is general
and can be extended for more comprehensive computational studies in
the future.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II provides calculation results,
comparative
analysis of the computed data against experimental ones, and fitting
of these data based on two simple models. The paper concludes with
a summary and discussion of the implications of our results in Section III.

II Computational Results
II.I Absorption Spectra
II.I.I Neutral Oligothiophenes
For each
OTn (n = 2–6),
we determined optimized structures of the ground electronic states
based on the semiempirical PM6 method57 and the density functional theory (DFT) method.58 For DFT calculations, three functionals, B3LYP,51,52 BVP86,53−55 and M06-2X,53−55 were used. Both vacuum state
and solution phase calculations were performed. For the latter, the
polarizable continuum model (PCM)59 was
employed to account for the solvation effect. We tried a range of
different basis sets and determined that 6-31+G(d,p) serves as a reasonable
choice with acceptable accuracy for all of the DFT calculations. Thus,
only the data for this basis are reported here. Excitation energies
were then calculated using the semiempirical ZINDO method for structures
optimized by the PM6 method57 and using
the TD-DFT method for structures optimized by the DFT method based
on the same functionals and the basis set. All calculations were conducted
by employing the Gaussian 09 package.60

For a thorough investigation of the effects of structure and
methods of calculation, it is ideal to compare all different methods
of excitation energy calculation for each structure determined. However,
considering the resulting size of the data set expected, we here limit
the scope of our study only to comparing fully semiempirical ones
and with fully DFT-based methods. Cross-examination of the effects
of structures will be the topic of future study when necessary. In
other words, the objective of this work is not to offer comprehensive
benchmarking but to compare and assess outcomes of select approaches
that are typically viable for large molecules. In addition, considering
the fact that the structures obtained from the PM6 method are not
particularly worse than those based on DFT calculations, we believe
the outcomes of calculations being presented here offer reasonable
assessment of the ZINDO calculation methods, which in turn can help
reassess old conclusions drawn from similar semiempirical calculations.
In addition, considering the efficiency of the semiempirical methods,
it is worth examining how the combination of the two best available
approaches performs against the DFT/TD-DFT combination.

Detailed
structural data are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). The resulting excitation energies
are listed in Table 1 and are compared with solution phase experimental data. Different
methods produce distinctively different trends in the dependence of
excitation energies on the number of repeat units n, as has been observed before.62 The result
of the TD-DFT method with the B3LYP functional is fairly close to
the experimental value for bithiophene (n = 2), which
is consistent with its good performance for calculating the structure
in the ground electronic state.63,64 However, its accuracy
degrades quickly as n increases. The BVP86 functional
underestimates excitation energies even more. These data for B3LYP
and BVP86 reflect well-known self-interaction errors,65 which appear to make them even worse than those based on
the PM6/ZINDO data. However, the M06-2X functional does not exhibit
such tendency and demonstrates the best performance for all of the
cases considered here. These results also suggest that the performance
of M06-2X is comparable to that of range-separated functionals37,47 and the GW/BSE approach,38 although structures
employed in these latter cases are somewhat different.

data in the vacuum
(v) and solution (s) phases and experimental data in the solution
phase61 are shown. Oscillator strengths
are shown in parentheses. The solvent of the solution phase is CHCl3, which is represented by the method of PCM in the calculation.
The ZINDO results are for structures optimized by the PM6 method.
TD-DFT calculations with three different functionals were conducted
for structures optimized by the DFT method with the same functional.
The basis of 6-31+G(d,p) was used for all of the DFT and TD-DFT calculations.

Inclusion of solvation effect
causes shifts of excitation energies
for all of the DFT data, whereas the ZINDO calculation results do
not exhibit a consistent trend. Of the three functionals tested for
the DFT method, the BVP86 functional produces results with the largest
red shift due to solvation and thus leads to further underestimation
of excitation energies. The smallest change due to solvation can be
seen for the M06-2X functional. The resulting values of excitation
energies, as can be seen from Table 1, are in relatively good agreement with experimental
data estimated from the position of absorption peak maxima.

Various models and fitting functions are available for the extrapolation
of computational data.20−25 In this work, we employ the following two model functions 1   2  Equation 1 represents the lowest exciton state (for J > 0) of the simple Frenkel exciton model66,67 with the following Hamiltonian 3  where |k⟩ represents
the state where the excitation is localized at each monomer unit. Equation 2 is the excitation
energy68 for a system of independent electrons
confined in a one-dimensional box of length (n +
α)lm, where lm is the length of the monomer unit, with sinusoidal potential
of amplitude E∞,2. This function
is based on a well-defined single-particle model,68 and the case with α = 0 was previously used for the
modeling of experimental data.69

Table 2 provides
all of the parameters of eqs 1 and 2 for the data of Table 1. Figure 1 compares the two functions with parameters
determined to fit the solution phase data. For eq 1, the quality of fitting is reasonable except
for the ZINDO data. Overall, the fitting by eq 2 appears to be more satisfactory, including
the case for ZINDO data, for which restriction of A and α to positive values was necessary. On the other hand,
the values of E∞,2 are significantly
lower than those of E∞,1.

The experimental data20,70,71 for maximum absorption frequencies of PTs are in the range of 2.5–2.6
eV. In the low temperature limit,72 the
vertical excitation energy has also been estimated to be 2.54 eV.
This is closer to E∞,1 than E∞,2. Thus, the former, which is based
on the exciton model, appears to serve as a better estimate for the
true asymptotic value than the latter. We believe that it is a general
trend that E∞,1 is higher and E∞,2 is lower than the true asymptotic
value. The physical implication of this is that the exciton model
of eq 3 underestimates
the delocalization, whereas the free particle model of eq 2 exaggerates its effect. Further
assessment of these trends requires more extensive computational study.

As can be seen from Table 2, the TD-DFT method with the M06-2X functional produces fitting
parameters that are in best agreement with experimental ones. The
values of E∞,1 and J differ from those of the experimental data only by about 5%. The
values of E∞,2 between the two
also differ by about 7%. Based on the fact that E∞,1 for the case of experimental data serves as
a better estimate for the asymptotic value than E∞,1, we believe that 2.69 eV, the value of E∞,1 for the M06-2X functional, is closest
to the theoretical PT limit of the lowest singlet excitation energy
in the solution phase.

II.I.II Cations
There
have been absorption
spectra for OTn+s created through pulse radiolysis73,74 and laser
flash photolysis.75 OTn+s are often the products of chemical
oxidation (doping process) and are known to lead to higher electronic
conductivity. It is known that35 OTn+s have two major
absorption bands for n < 8, with the third one
appearing for n ≥ 8. Of the two transitions
for n < 8, the major bands lying in the higher-energy
side have more well-established experimental data, which are listed
in Table 3, and will
be used for the comparison of computational data and fitting functions.

a Oscillator strengths
are shown in
parentheses. The results for solution phase are for PCM models of
CH2Cl2. The semiempirical calculation by the
ZINDO method was made for structures optimized by the PM6 method.
TD-DFT calculations with three different functionals were conducted
for structures optimized by the DFT method with the same functional.
The basis of 6-31+G(d,p) was used for all of the DFT and TD-DFT calculations.

We calculated excitation energies
of OTn+ with n = 2–6
employing the ZINDO/PM6 and TD-DFT/DFT methods in the same manner
as was done for neutral molecules. The effect of solvation was also
calculated employing the method of PCM for dichloromethane. The results
are shown in Table 3 along with the experimental data obtained from absorption spectroscopy
in dichloromethane.73 All of these data
were fitted by eqs 1 and 2 as in the case of neutral molecules. The resulting
parameters are listed in Table 4. Figure 2 compares
these fitting curves with the solution phase data in Table 3. For the experimental data, E∞,1 is about 0.16 eV higher and E∞,2 is about 0.3 eV lower than the estimate
by Salzner,35 which is 1.1 eV for the corresponding
E2 states. This is consistent with our view that E∞,1 might serve as an upper bound for
the true asymptotic value and is closer to this than E∞,2.

The ZINDO/PM6 method produces excitation energies reasonably close
to the experimental value for each molecule. However, the relative
positions of other excitation energies and the magnitudes of the oscillator
strengths in general are not consistent with the experimental data.
The effects of solvation also vary significantly depending on the
length of the molecule, causing a red shift for n = 2 but blue shift for larger molecules. On the other hand, the
qualitative features of all of the TD-DFT/DFT data are consistent
with experimental results in that the major transitions have higher
energies of excitation than the minor ones. In contrast to neutral
molecules, the results for B3LYP and BVP86 agree fairly well with
the experimental data. For further examination of the accuracy, we
made additional calculations employing the extended basis set for
the case of the BVP86 functional. Even when the second diffuse basis
functions as well as multiple polarization basis functions were added,
we did not notice significant change in the values of excitation energies.
This confirmed that the 6-31+G(d,p) basis was sufficient for this case.

Figure 3 Calculated and experimental absorption transition energies of OTn– versus
1/n in solvent CH2Cl2. The
solid lines are fitting curves based on eq 1, and the dot-dashed lines are fitting curves
based on eq 2. The values
of fitting parameters are shown in Table 6.

The B3LYP and BVP86 functionals exhibit relatively good performance
for these cations. However, the trends shown in Tables 3 and 4 suggest that
this is due to the cancellation of two opposing errors. For OT2+, both functionals
overestimate the major excitation energies by about 0.2 eV, most likely
due to underestimation of the electronic correlation effect. On the
other hand, the larger values of J for these two
methods relative to the experimental one, as can be seen from Table 4, show that there
is significant self-interaction error, which causes steeper decrease
of the excitation energy with the length of OT than the experimental
one. On the other hand, M06-2X overestimates the transition energies
by about 0.4–0.5 eV for all of the cases. However, this is
a systematic error relatively independent of the length of the oligomer.
Indeed, the value of J fitted from the data of M06-2X
is quite close to that from the experimental data even in this case,
differing less than 1.5%.

calculations
were performed for OT anions, and the results are provided in Table 5. Published experimental
results for anions are difficult to find, and we here provide unpublished
experimental data offered by the John Miller group for comparison.
The overall trends of the data based on different calculation methods
are similar to those of cations. These results are consistent with
the interpretation based on a simple molecular orbital picture. The
excitation energies for OTn+ can be understood as mainly due to transitions
from the singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) to the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO). On the other hand, the excitation energies
of OTn– can be understood as being mainly due to transitions from SOMO –
1 to SOMO. The similarity of the excitation energies for cations and
anions can be understood from similar magnitudes of these gaps, as
expected from the fact that SOMO and LUMO for OTn+ become SOMO – 1 and SOMO
for OTn–, respectively.

a Oscillator strengths
are shown in
parentheses. The results for the solution phase are for PCM models
of CH2Cl2. TD-DFT calculations with three different
functionals were conducted for structures optimized by the DFT method
with the same functional. The basis of 6-31+G(d,p) was used for all
of the DFT and TD-DFT calculations.

The trends of parameters of eqs 1 and 2 fitting the data
for anions
are also similar to those of cations (see Figure 3 and Table 6). Both B3LYP- and BVP86-based calculation data reproduce
the experimental results fairly well. However, as in the case of cations,
this is mostly likely due to the cancellation of two opposing errors,
one that leads to the overestimation of excitation energy as apparent
for OT2– and the other due to self-interaction error. As in the case of cations,
the M06-2X functional results in overestimation of E∞ by 0.42 eV, but the value of J for these data is virtually the same as that for experimental results.
Thus, the discrepancies of M06-2X appear to be mostly due to systematic
errors independent of the size of oligomers.

II.II Emission Spectra
Calculation of
emission spectra requires optimization in the excited state, for which
we here consider the TD-DFT method only. For the same three functionals
and the basis set, we optimized OTs for the first excited states and
calculated their vertical emission energies. As expected, all of the
OTs have quinoidal and planar structures in the excited electronic
states. Calculation based on the BVP86 functional produces carbon
bond lengths that are slightly longer than those based on the B3LYP
functional (see SI), whereas lengths of
bonds containing sulfur remain almost the same.

Table 7 lists the
values of vertical electronic emission transition energies calculated
as described above in both vacuum and solution phases. Experimental
data for two different solvents are also shown for comparison. As
in the case of absorption spectra, both B3LYP and BVP86 functionals
tend to underestimate the transition energies substantially, with
the errors worsening as n becomes larger. On the
other hand, the performance of the M06-2X functional is fairly satisfactory.
The solution phase results for the M06-2X functional are smaller than
the experimental data by about 0.1–0.13 eV, but their dependence
on the length of OT is very close to that for experimental data as
can be seen from Table 8 and Figure 4. The
value of E∞,1 fitting the M06-2X
data is smaller than that based on experimental results by about 0.13
eV. On the other hand, the value of J fitting the
M06-2X data is different from that for the experimental results by
less than 1.5%.

III Discussion
For neutral OTs, we find that
the performance of ZINDO/PM6 in vacuum
is reasonable and can be viewed to be even better than that of the
TD-DFT method with B3LYP and BVP86 functionals. However, its solution
phase results with PCM are somewhat erratic in the sense that the
solvation effect causes a blue shift of the excitation energy for n = 3–5. The overall ZINDO results for OT cations
and anions are also unreliable. This is not unexpected considering
that parameters of ZINDO and PM6 were determined for neutral molecules
and may also account for some solvation effect already through fitting
to solution phase experimental data.

The TD-DFT/DFT calculations
employing B3LYP and BVP86 underestimate
the excitation energies for neutral OTs, but their performance for
OT cations and anions appears to be reasonable at least up to n = 6. However, even in these cases, a comparison of fitting
parameters clearly indicates that these overestimate the lowering
of excitation energies with respect to the length of OT.

Overall,
the performance of M06-2X is most satisfactory, producing
correct trends with the increase of oligomer length, although excitation
energies for OTn+ and OTn– are overestimated systematically by about 0.4–0.5 eV. However,
whether this is purely due to computational error or the effect of
counter charge effect needs to be understood better. What is certain
at this point is that, in all of the cases, the M06-2X functional
serves as a reliable method for evaluating the coupling constant J, defined within the exciton model of eq 1. This is consistent with other results where
the M06-2X functional is shown to provide reasonable estimate of electronic
couplings while overestimating excitation energies.77

To test further the reliability of the model parameters,
we conducted
additional calculation of absorption and emission energies based on
the M06-2X functional for OTn with n = 10. The resulting value of absorption energy in CHCl3 was found to be 2.75 eV and that of emission energy in dioxane
was 2.05 eV. These values are fairly close to those based on eq 1, with parameters in Tables 2 and 8, which are 2.81 and 2.05 eV. On the other hand, the values
based on eq 2 are 2.62
and 2.01 eV. This confirms that the latter model is less reliable
than the former.

We also determined new fitting parameters including
the data for
OT10. The resulting values are listed in Table 9. The new parameters for eq 1 changed slightly from
those in Tables 2 and 8 and became even closer to experimental values.
On the other hand, the new values for eq 2 are quite different from those in Tables 2 and 8 and do not appear to have converged well enough. The good performance
of eq 1 in fitting both
experimental and computational data also confirms the J-aggregate-like
character of intrachain couplings within a single oligothiophene.5 Utilization of this model for aggregates so as
to explain H-aggregate-like behavior for intermolecular couplings5 is an interesting possibility, for which further
test of the exciton model for the length dependence of oscillator
strengths is needed.

IV Conclusions
In this paper, we presented vertical transition
energies for electronic
absorption spectroscopy of OTn, OTn+, and OTn– and for
electronic emission spectroscopy of OTn with n = 2–6. The methods of calculation
employed here were the semiempirical ZINDO/PM6 method and the TD-DFT/DFT
method with three different functionals, B3LYP, BVP86, and M06-2X.
Comparison of these with experimental results demonstrates the best
performance of the TD-DFT method with the M06-2X functional for neutral
molecules. Although this was expected, the level of agreement with
experimental results as confirmed here is certainly notable. For cations
and anions, the results of the TD-DFT/DFT method with B3LYP and BVP86
appear to be closer to experimental results. However, the distance
dependences of results for the M06-2X functional are still in best
agreement with experimental trends.

Although they are based
on simple assumptions, the fitting results
of both the computational and experimental data by the two model functions, eqs 1 and 2, have significant implications. First, they show that such fitting
can serve as an effective means for comparing the performance of different
computational methods. Second, as discussed in the last section, the
analysis of the fitting parameters shows that the exciton model is
more reliable and offers better estimates for the asymptotic values
of the transition energies. This suggests the feasibility of constructing
coarse-grained exciton-bath models that can be useful for the modeling
of aggregates of OTs and PTs.

There are two important issues
to be addressed in the future as
the next step of this work. First, for the development of complete
exciton-bath models and also for a more accurate comparison of computational
and experimental data, it is important to account for Huang–Rhys
factors of all major vibrational modes, possible Duschinsky effects,
differences of vibrational zero point energies between the excited
and ground electronic states, and thermal fluctuations. Some of these
data are already available,5,15 but more extensive
calculations and simulations are needed to obtain comprehensive enough
data for all of neutral and charged OTs and PTs. Second, for OTn+ and OTn–, the effects
of counterions need to be understood better although their effects
were assessed to be relatively minor for small oligomers.35,36 For the case of polyaniline, strong interactions between ions and
the backbone of molecules result in significant modification of UV–vis
spectra. Thus, inclusion of the counterion effect may still turn out
to be necessary for more accurate calculations of spectroscopic data
for OTn+ and
OTn– as
well. Future effort will be devoted to addressing these issues.
