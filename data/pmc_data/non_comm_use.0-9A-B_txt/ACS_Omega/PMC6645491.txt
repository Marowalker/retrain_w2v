The
reactions of 2,3-bis(diisopropylsilyl)thiophene (1) with
diphenylacetylene, phenylacetylene, trimethylsilylacetylene,
and mesitylacetylene have been reported. The reactions of 1 with diphenylacetylene and phenylacetylene in the presence of a
catalytic amount of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum(0) at 80
°C gave [1,4]disilino[2,3-b]thiophene derivatives.
With trimethylsilylacetylene, 1 afforded two types of
products arising from sp-hybridized C–H bond activation of
the acetylene, together with [1,3]disilolo[4,5-b]thiophene
derivatives. A similar treatment of 1 with mesitylacetylene
produced two regioisomers of products arising from the C–H
bond activation of mesitylacetylene. Theoretical calculations for
the intramolecular reactions of 10a and 10b are also discussed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
It is well-known that reactions of organosilanes with unsaturated
compounds in the presence of a catalytic amount of transition-metal
complexes can be employed for the synthesis of various organosilicon
compounds.1 In these reactions, the silyl-transition-metal
complexes would be formed as reactive species. For example, the benzodisilaplatinacyclopentene
derivatives are produced by reactions of 1,2-bis(hydrosilyl)benzenes
with platinum complexes, and their chemical properties have been widely
examined by Tanaka et al., Nagashima et al., and other chemists.2−8

We have reported that the platinum-catalyzed reactions of
tetraethyl-substituted
benzodisilacyclobutene with alkynes such as diphenylacetylene, 3-hexyne,
and phenylacetylene readily produce the respective 1:1 adducts, benzodisilacyclohexadiene
derivatives, in high yield.9−11 On the other hand, platinum-catalyzed
reactions of tetraisopropyl-substituted benzodisilacyclobutene with
the same alkynes afford two types of products, benzodisilacyclohexadienes
and benzodisilacyclopentenes.12,13

Recently, we
have demonstrated that the platinum-catalyzed reactions
of 2,3-bis(diethylsilyl)thiophene with alkynes such as diphenylacetylene,
3-hexyne, and phenylacetylene afford the respective [1,4]disilino[2,3-b]thiophenes.14 In these reactions,
[1,2,5]platinadisilolo[3,4-b]thiophene derivatives
would be formed as the reactive intermediates.

It is of considerable
interest to us to investigate the chemical
behavior of 2,3-bis(silyl)thiophene with bulky substituents on the
silicon atoms toward alkynes in the presence of a platinum catalyst.
In this article, we report the platinum-catalyzed reactions of 2,3-bis(diisopropylsilyl)thiophene
with mono- and disubstituted alkynes.

2 Results
and Discussion
The starting compound, 2,3-bis(diisopropylsilyl)thiophene
(1), was prepared by the reaction of 2-bromo-3-iodothiophene
with magnesium and chlorodiisopropylsilane in the presence of a catalytic
amount of copper(I) cyanide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Scheme 1).15

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Compound 1
We first examined the reactions of 1 with
diphenylacetylene.
Treatment of compound 1 with diphenylacetylene in the
presence of Pt(PPh3)4 in refluxing benzene for
96 h gave 1,1,4,4-tetraisopropyl-2,3-diphenyl-1,4-dihydro-[1,4]disilino[2,3-b]thiophene (2) in 80% yield (Scheme 2). The structure of 2 was verified by spectroscopic analysis. The mass spectrum for 2 shows parent ions at m/z 488, corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of C30H40Si2S. The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 shows septet signals at 1.33 and 1.34 ppm, attributable
to the methine protons in the isopropyl groups at silicon; four doublet
signals at 0.80, 0.81, 1.04, and 1.09 ppm, attributable to the methyl
protons of the isopropyl groups; two doublet signals at 7.39 and 7.76
ppm, attributable to the thienylene protons; and signals attributed
to the phenyl protons. The 29Si NMR spectrum for 2 shows signals at −10.6 and −9.2 ppm.

Scheme 2 Reactions
of 1 with Diphenylacetylene
On the basis of the results obtained from the platinum-catalyzed
dehydrogenative double silylation2−6,14 of various unsaturated compounds
with bis(hydrosilane)s, the formation of adducts 2 obtained
from the platinum-catalyzed reaction of 1 with diphenylacetylene
may be explained as follows: (1) oxidative addition of the platinum
species to one of the Si–H bonds in 1; (2) dehydrogenation
to give the bis(silyl)platinum complex (3); (3) insertion
of a triple bond of alkynes into a platinum–silicon bond to
produce the platinum complex (4); (4) reductive elimination
of 2 from the Pt complex (4) (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
for the Production of Compound 2
Unfortunately, compound 1 did not react with
phenyltrimethylsilylacetylene
and bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene. The starting compound 1 was recovered quantitatively.

Next, we investigated the platinum-catalyzed
reaction of 1 with monosubstituted alkynes under the
same conditions as
described above. Treatment of 1 with phenylacetylene
at 80 °C indicated that 1:1 cyclic adducts as a mixture of two
regioisomers, namely, 1,1,4,4-tetraisoproyl-3-phenyl-1,4-dihydro-[1,4]disilino[2,3-b]thiophene (5a) and 1,1,4,4-tetraisopropyl-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydro-[1,4]disilino[2,3-b]thiophene (5b), were produced in a ratio
of 3:1 in 60% yield, along with unreacted starting compound 1 (40%) (Scheme 4). All attempts to separate 5a and 5b were
unsuccessful, but their structures were verified by spectroscopic
analysis of the mixture.

Scheme 4 Reactions of 1 with Phenylacetylene
and Trimethylsilylacetylene
The regioselective formation of 5a and 5b in the platinum-catalyzed reaction of 1 with
monosubstituted
alkynes can be best explained by a series of reactions similar to
the reaction shown in Scheme 3. Namely, the regioselective addition of a Pt–Si bond
in the intermediate similar to 3 to the carbon–carbon
triple bond of monosubstituted acetylene affords predominantly 1,1,5,5-tetraisopropyl-3-phenyl-1,5-dihydro-[1,2,5]platinadisilepino[3,4-b]thiophene as the intermediate. It has been reported that
the introduction of electron-withdrawing substituents on the silicon
atom in the silyl–platinum complexes enhances the Pt–Si
bond.14,16,17 In the present
reactions, the Pt–Si bond of the Pt–Si–C–C
moiety is probably weaker than that of the Pt–Si–C–S
moiety (sulfur has higher electronegativity than carbon) and the former
migrates to the less hindered carbon atom in the coordinated monosubstituted
alkyne to produce insertion product 5a.

When a
mixture of 1 and trimethylsilylacetylene in
the presence of Pt(PPh3)4 catalyst was heated
to reflux in benzene for 20 h, four products were obtained. We separated
these products from the reaction mixture by column chromatography
and identified them as (E)- and (Z)-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyl-2-((trimethylsilyl)methylene)-2,3-dihydro-1H-[1,3]disilolo[4,5-b]thiophene (6a,b), (2-((diisopropyl)silyl)thiophen-3-yl)diisopropyl((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)silane
(7), and (3-((diisopropyl)silyl)thiophen-2-yl)diisopropyl((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)silane
(8) by mass spectrometry (MS) and 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 4). Unfortunately, all attempts
to separate 6a and 6b were unsuccessful.
The ratio of 6a and 6b was determined to
be 1.6:1 by 1H NMR spectrometric analysis. Compounds 7 and 8 were isolated by column chromatography.
The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 shows a singlet signal
at 0.22 ppm attributed to trimethylsilyl protons and a triplet signal
at 4.28 ppm attributed to a proton on the silicon atom along with
isopropyl and thienyl protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 7 reveals a resonance at −0.16 ppm, attributed to trimethylsilyl
carbons, and two resonances at 108.70 and 118.17 ppm, attributed to
sp-hybridized carbons as well as isopropyl and thienyl carbons. The 1H NMR spectrum of 8 shows a singlet signal at
0.21 ppm, attributed to trimethylsilyl protons, and a double of triplet
signal at 4.46 ppm (4J = 3.6 Hz, 5J = 0.8 Hz), attributed to an Si–H
proton along with isopropyl and thienyl protons. The 13C NMR spectrum of 8 reveals a resonance at −0.10
ppm, attributed to trimethylsilyl carbons, and two resonances at 109.90
and 119.38 ppm, attributed to the sp-hybridized carbons as well as
isopropyl and thienyl carbons.

Scheme 5 illustrates
a possible mechanistic interpretation of the observed reaction course
for products 7 and 8. The formation of 7 and 8 can be understood in terms of insertion
of the Pt atom into the sp-hybridized C–H bond of the acetylene
leading to 9, followed by the reductive elimination of
the C–Si bond to give complexes 10a and 10b.

Scheme 5 Reaction Mechanism for the Production of 7 and 8
To confirm whether or not compounds 6a and 6b were produced from compounds 7 and 8 by
intramolecular hydrosilation, we carried out reactions of 7 and 8 with a catalytic amount of the platinum complex.
Thus, the reaction of 7 with 6 mol % of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)platinum(0)
at 80 °C for 130 h produced 6a and 6b in the ratio of 1.2:1 in 47% combined yield, in addition to the
starting compound 7 and its isomer 8 in
the ratio of 3:1 (Scheme 6). The presence of 8 in this reaction obviously
indicates the production of intermediates 11a and 11b (Scheme 7). A similar reaction of 8 in the presence of the platinum
catalyst produced 6a and 6b in the ratio
of 1.3:1 in 49% combined yield, along with the starting compound 8 and its isomer 7 in the ratio of 5:1. These
reactions indicate that compounds 6a and 6b must come from the intramolecular hydrosilation of 7 and 8.

Scheme 6 Production of 6a and 6b from 7 and 8
Scheme 7 Reaction Mechanism of 6a and 6b from 7 and 8
Next, we investigated the reaction of 1 with
mesitylacetylene.
Thus, when a mixture of 1 and mesitylacetylene in the
presence of the same catalyst was heated to reflux in benzene for
4 h, a mixture of the regioisomers was obtained in an almost quantitative
yield (Scheme 8). The
regioisomers were separated using column choromatography and assigned
as [2-(diisopropylsilyl)thiophen-3-yl]diisopropyl(mesitylethynyl)silane
(12) and [3-(diisopropylsilyl)thiophen-2-yl]diisopropyl(mesitylethynyl)silane
(13) by MS and 1H, 13C, and 29Si NMR spectroscopy.

Scheme 8 Reaction of 1 with Mesitylacetylene
2.1 Theoretical Calculations
We carried
out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the
energy and structural changes from 7 and 8 to 6a and 6b. Gaussian09 program package18 was employed together with the Becke-three-parameter-Lee–Yang–Parr
hybrid functional.19 The Los Alamos effective
core potentials were used for Si, S, and Pt atoms along with the corresponding
valence basis sets.20 For the H and C atoms,
the Dunning–Huzinaga full double-basis set was employed.21

The calculated species are Pt complexes,
that is, 10a, 10b, 11a, and 11b, shown in Scheme 7, and their transition states (TS’s) are labeled as
TS(10–11a) and TS(10–11b). Furthermore, 10a and 10b mutually convert through TS(10–14a), 14a, TS(14a–14b), 14b, and TS(14–10b), as shown in Scheme 9, and these structures were also investigated. In the calculations,
TS is searched first. Then, the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)
analysis is carried out at each TS for both directions, that is, the
reactant and product sides. Because the IRC analysis for the whole
reaction path is very time consuming, it is limited to the neighborhood
of TS’s, and normal optimization runs are followed at the end
points of IRC analysis. Finally, we confirmed that the reaction path
is seamlessly connected from the reactant, via TS, to the product.

Scheme 9 Species Evaluated by DFT Calculation
The optimized structures for 10a, TS(10–11a), and 11a are shown
in the
left column and 10b, TS(10–11b), and 11b are shown in the right column of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the optimized structures
for TS(10–14a) and 14a in the left column and TS(10–14b) and 14b in the right column. TS(14a–14b) is a junction between the a- and b-series and shown at
the center. For all of the intermediate species, the optimized structures
are well-described by the line drawing structures shown in Schemes 7 and 9. A noticeable point is that a weak
interaction between the C≡C group and the Pt atom is suggested
in 10a and 10b.

Figure 1 Optimized structures
for 10a, TS(10–11a),
and 11a (left) and 10b, TS(10–11b), and 11b (right).
Total energy of 10a is taken as the zero of relative
energy.

Figure 2 Optimized structures for TS(10–14a) and 14a (left), TS(10–14b) and 14b (right), and TS(14a–14b) (bottom center). Total energy of 10a is
taken as the zero of relative energy.

The energy changes for all reaction paths are shown in Figure 3. The total energy
of 10a is taken as zero. Among the TS’s, TS(10–11a) and TS(10–11b) are the highest, and the conversions from 10a to 11a and 10b to 11b are
the rate-determining step. This means that compounds in the a- and
b-series can mix with each other because the energies for TS(10a–14a), TS(14a–14b), and TS(10–14b) are
lower than those for TS(10–11a) and
TS(10–11b). The conversion from 14a to 14b proceeds by an internal rotation of
the Si–C–Pt group. The energy difference between the
corresponding compounds in the a- and b-series is relatively small
(at maximum, 16.3 kJ mol–1 between 10a and 10b). Thus, the energetics for the a- and b-series
reactions resemble each other, and the two sets of reactions occur
in parallel.

b-reaction
paths. Total energy of 10a is taken as the zero of relative
energy.

3 Conclusions
We describe here the preparation and platinum-catalyzed reactions
of 2,3-bis(diisopropylsilyl)thiophene. The reactions of 2,3-bis(diisopropylsilyl)thiophene 1 with diphenylacetylene in the presence of a catalytic amount
of Pt(PPh3)4 proceeded to give cyclic products
such as 2. A similar treatment of 1 with
monosubstituted alkynes bearing less bulky substituents such as phenylacetylene
afforded regioisomers of the cyclic products, whereas with alkynes
bearing bulky substituents, 1 gives products arising
from sp-hybridized C–H bond activation of the alkynes. In the
intramolecular reactions of 10a and 10b,
the theoretical calculations indicate that the conversion from 14a to 14b or 14b to 14a proceeds with the internal rotation of the Si–C–Pt
group.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General
Procedure
All reactions of
2,3-bis(isopropylsilyl)thiophene 1 were carried out under
an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Yields of the products were determined
by analytical gas–liquid chromatography (GLC) with the use
of tridecane or pentadecane as an internal standard on the basis of
the starting compound used. NMR spectra were recorded on a JMN-ECS400
spectrometer. Low- and high-resolution mass spectra were recorded
on a JEOL model JMS-700 instrument. Column chromatography was performed
using Wakogel C-300 (WAKO).

and 0.411 g (4.59 mol) of copper(I) cyanide in 10 mL of dry THF. To
this mixture was added dropwise a solution of 5.94 g (20.6 mmol) of
2-bromo-3-iodothiophene in 10 mL of dry THF. The mixture was heated

4.2.3 Platinum-Catalyzed
Reaction of 1 with Trimethylsilylacetylene
In
a 30 mL two-necked flask
fitted with a reflux condenser were placed 0.309 g (0.988 mmol) of 1, 0.215 g (2.19 mmol) of trimethylsilylacetylene, and 0.0640
g (0.0514 mmol) of Pt(PPh3)4 in 15 mL of dry
benzene. The mixture was heated to reflux for 20 h. The mixture was
analyzed by GLC as being 6a and 6b (22%
combined yield) and 7 and 8 (71% combined
yield). The ratio of 6a and 6b in the reaction
mixture was determined to be 1.6:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic
analysis. The ratio of 7 and 8 in the reaction
mixture was determined to be 1:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic
analysis. The solvent benzene was evaporated, and the residue was

4.2.4 Platinum-Catalyzed Reaction of 7
In a
30 mL two-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser
were placed 0.1110 g (0.271 mmol) of 7 and 0.0190 g (0.0152
mmol) of Pt(PPh3)4 in 9 mL of dry benzene. The
mixture was heated to reflux for 130 h. The mixture was analyzed by
GLC as being 6a and 6b (47% combined yield)
and 7 and 8 (53% combined yield). The ratio
of 6a and 6b in the reaction mixture was
determined to be 1.2:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis.
The ratio of 7 and 8 in the reaction mixture
was determined to be 3:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis.
All spectral data for 6a, 6b, 7, and 8 were identical to those of the authentic samples.

In a 30 mL two-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser
were placed 0.0979 g (0.239 mmol) of 8 and 0.0168 g (0.0135
mmol) of Pt(PPh3)4 in 6 mL of dry benzene. The
mixture was heated to reflux for 130 h. The mixture was analyzed by
GLC as being 6a and 6b (49% combined yield)
and 7 and 8 (51% combined yield). The ratio
of 6a and 6b in the reaction mixture was
determined to be 1.3:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis.
The ratio of 7 and 8 in the reaction mixture
was determined to be 1:5 by 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis.
All spectral data for 6a, 6b, 7, and 8 were identical to those of the authentic samples.

4.2.6 Platinum-Catalyzed Reaction of 1 with
Mesitylacetylene
In a 30 mL two-necked flask fitted
with a reflux condenser were placed 0.306 g (0.979 mmol) of 1, 0.312 g (2.16 mmol) of mesitylacetylene, and 0.0653 g (0.0525
mmol) of Pt(PPh3)4 in 15 mL of dry benzene.
The mixture was heated to reflux for 4 h. The mixture was analyzed
by GLC as being 12 and 13 (97% combined
yield). The ratio of 12 and 13 in the reaction
mixture was determined to be 1:1 by 1H NMR spectroscopic
analysis. The solvent benzene was evaporated, and the residue was
chromatographed on a silica gel column using hexane as the eluent.
