Extraction of metal
ions (i.e., Cs+, K+,
Na+, and Rb+) in the presence of ionophore such
as dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) from the nitrobenzene–water
biphasic system is reported by COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening
model for real solvents) predictions, molecular dynamics simulation,
along with experimental validation. The predicted values of selectivity
as obtained for the Na+–DB18C6 complex were 4.571,
4.877, and 4.947 at 298.15, 308.15, and 318.15 K, respectively. This
was then confirmed by the experimental distribution coefficient (D) as obtained in the diluent systems along with by varying
the metal ion to crown ether ligand (M–L) mole ratios: 10:1
(0.1 M M+ and 0.01 M DB18C6), 1:1 (0.01 M M+ and 0.01 M DB18C6), and 1:10 (0.001 M M+ and 0.01 M DB18C6).
The experimentally determined values of DNa (i.e., 0.059, 0.060, and 0.056) were found to be very large as compared
to the values of DCs (i.e., 0.001, 0.010,
and 0.024) in the nitrobenzene phase. It indicates an excellent extraction
ability of DB18C6 for Na+. The rate of phase separation
for the Cs+NO3– system was
slow as compared to other metal ion systems. The binding energies,
free energies, and nonbonded interaction energies of the complexed
metal ion in solution were calculated with both explicit and implicit
solvent models. A higher interaction energy between Na+–DB18C6 complex and nitrobenzene was observed (i.e., −289.92
in the explicit model and −143.12 kcal/mol in the implicit
model) when compared with other metal ions (i.e., Cs+,
K+, and Rb+).

1 Introduction
Extraction
of metal ions is considered to be a very complex process.
The spent nuclear fuel contains a small amount of 137Cs
and a large amount of Na+, which is a major heat-generating
radionuclide.1,2 Removal of radionuclide leads
to reduction in heat load, which lowers the volume of repository required
for final vitrification. The partitioning of these radionuclides is
one of the most difficult challenges in spent nuclear reprocessing.
Specific ionophores such as calix[4]arene-crown-6 ethers are extensively
used for the extraction of cesium ion from the nuclear waste solution.3 Removal of cesium ion using crown ether (CE)
has been reported earlier by Luo et al.4 and McDowell et al.5 The application
of CE has been found to be very efficient for the extraction of metal
ions such as cesium, sodium, and potassium.4

Along with the ionophore, the diluent also plays a major role
in
liquid–liquid extraction. The ionophore is usually soluble
in the diluent, which aids in the metal ion coordination. The use
of nitrobenzene as an organic diluent for the extraction of alkali
metal ions using dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) has been reported by
Makrlík et al.6 Michael et al.7 reported a theoretical study on the neat water–nitrobenzene
liquid–liquid interface at 300 K. Jorge et al.8 further studied the intrinsic structure and dynamics of
the water–nitrobenzene interface. Continuing with the same
trend, the transfer of calcium ion across the water–nitrobenzene
interface has also been performed by Santos et al.9

On the basis of this perspective, a need is felt
for a comprehensive
study involving the two-phase system, that is, the CE and the metal
ion. One of the commonly used quantum chemical (QC)-based models,
that is, COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening model for real solvents),10 is based on the integration of QC calculations
and a statistical mechanical framework. This model is used to determine
the activity coefficient of any component in the system by placing
the solute in the midst of a conductor, so as to attain perfect screening.
The screening charges developed are used to predict the chemical potential
and the activity coefficient.11,12 However, COSMO-RS predicts
equilibrium properties and hence may not provide a deep understanding
of the solvation and transport mechanism. To get a wide picture, molecular
dynamic (MD) simulations are necessary. Although COSMO-RS will help
us in predicting the Gibbs solvation free energy, MD will provide
information on the demixing index (rate of phase separation) and radial
distribution functions (RDFs).

We have also attempted to predict
the interaction energies during
complexation for the metal ion–ionophore pair using density
functional theory (DFT) optimizations within a polarizable continuum
model (PCM) and an explicit solvent model. Together, we shall be able
to obtain lucid information on the underlying mechanism of charge
transfer.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 COSMO-RS
Predictions
Within the COSMO-RS
mode, the sigma profile is a useful descriptor which defines the polarity
of two adjacent molecules or segments. These are depicted in Figure 1, indicating the
local polarity of the molecular surfaces. The hydrogen-bonding cutoff
region for screening charge density (σ) is defined by the hydrogen
bond acceptor (σHB < −0.0084 e/Å2) and hydrogen bond donor (σHB < +0.0084
e/Å2).13 A fraction of
sigma profile in the acceptor region (σHB < −0.0084
e/Å2) defines the electropositive charge of the molecule,
which shows the ability of the respective section to donate a hydrogen
bond. This is evident from the sharp peak of the metal ion, which
is positive in nature. The screening charges developed are opposite
to that of the inherent solute density. On the other hand, a fraction
of the sigma profile in the donor region (σHB >
+0.0084
e/Å2) defines an electronegative part of the molecule,
which indicates its ability to accept a hydrogen bond. This corresponds
to the anion of the metal salts. The sigma profiles of DB18C6 along
with the metal ion (or the complexes) are shown in Figure 1a. From the sigma profiles,
it is implied that the metal ions (Figure 1b) are located toward the hydrogen bond donor
region, that is, σHB, or the cutoff for hydrogen
bond energy is greater than +0.0084 e/Å2. A contrary
is observed for the metal ion complex where the majority of the profile
lies in the nonpolar region of −0.0084 e/Å2 < σHB < +0.0084 e/Å2. This
indicates that after the capture, it indeed becomes hydrophobic and
tends to have a potential to diffuse into another solvent. This indicates
an increased stability of the metal ions when encompassed within the
ionophore.

The screening charge density of
DB18C6 and its complexes is shown
in Figure 2a–e.
The red portion shows the positive surface screening charge within
the CE cavity, whereas the blue region corresponds to the negative
surface charge of the trapped metal ion (Figure 2b–e). It is interesting to observe
that the charge neutralization on the introduction of metal ion is
highly dispersed in the case of Cs+ extraction (Figure 2b) when compared
to the same for Na+ (Figure 2d). However, we cannot comment on the nature of interaction
or binding energies because we do not know the absolute activity coefficient.
This can be decided by the selectivity values which are experimentally
observed.

The selectivities for the metal
ions and their complexes in the
nitrobenzene–water binary system at three temperatures (i.e.,
298.15, 308.15, and 318.15 K) are listed in Table 1. The selectivity (S) of
the solutes was obtained from the ratio of the aqueous species in
the nitrobenzene-rich phase (extract) to the complex in the nitrobenzene-rich
phase.14 1  where γ1∞ and γ2∞ are the activity coefficients
of the complex and water at infinite dilution. The selectivity of
metal ions is found to be lower than that of the complexed metal ions
in the nitrobenzene–water binary system. For the calculation,
we have assumed a complete dissociation of the metal salts. Thus,
the sigma profiles of the individual ions are linearly added up as
per their individual sigma profile.14 The
selectivity was found to decrease with increasing metal ion size,
that is, Na+ > K+ > Rb+ >
Cs+. The selectivities of Na+NO3– (i.e., 1.285, 1.257, and 1.231) were found to be higher
than those
of other metal ions, that is, K+NO3–, Rb+NO3–, and Cs+NO3–. Similarly, in the case of the
Na+–CE complex, the selectivities (i.e., 4.571,
4.877, and 4.947) were larger than the other complexed metal ions.
The selectivity sequence of the complexed metal ions is known to depend
on the metal ion size and the ligand cavities.15 The high selectivity of the complexed metal ion signifies
the good extraction ability of CE for metal ions in the nitrobenzene–water
binary system.

2.2 MD Simulations
In this subsection,
we will first report the phase separation of the nitrobenzene–water
mixtures so as to understand the extraction mechanism. The following
sections will then demonstrate the computation of binding energies,
free energies, and the interaction energies of the complexed metal
ions using the explicit and implicit solvent models.

2.2.1 Demixing Simulations for the Binary Nitrobenzene–Water
Solution
In this section, phase separation of nitrobenzene–water
binary mixtures containing the ionophore (DB18C6) and the salts (i.e.,
Cs+NO3–, K+NO3–, Na+NO3–, and Rb+NO3–) is reported.
The two liquids were found to be separated rapidly after 1 ns run,
forming two clean bulk phases. During the dynamics, the hydrophilic
moieties of the solutes (i.e., Cs+, K+, Na+, and Rb+) were found to diffuse from the bulk
aqueous phase to the nitrobenzene side of the interface in the presence
of ionophore. This is observed from the density curves of metal ions
pointing to the broad peak near the interface at 40 ns (Figures 3–5). The MD simulations were carried out at four-metal ion to CE ligand
(M/L) stoichiometric ratios: 1:1 (i.e., 6 M+ and 6 DB18C6),
1:2 (i.e., 6 M+ and 12 DB18C6), and 2:1 (i.e., 12 M+ and 6 DB18C6). In the Na+NO3– (1:1) system, the first complexation of Na+ with DB18C6
was observed only after 3 ns of simulation time, whereas at the end
of the dynamics, we observed three complexes at the interface (Figure 3a). The position
of the complexes is specified by red circles, as shown in Figure 3. In the case of
K+NO3– (1:1) and Rb+NO3– (1:1) systems, the complexation
was observed at 12 and 17 ns, respectively. Both the complexes were
found to be located near the interface (Figure 3b,c). In the case of Cs+NO3– system, a single Cs+ ion was
found to diffuse from the bulk aqueous phase to the interface (Figure 3d).

(b) K+NO3– (yellow), (c) Rb+NO3– (orange), (d) Cs+NO3– (cyan), and DB18C6 at 1:1 (metal
ion/ligand) ratio. Plots for density profiles of solvents and solutes
for each system are given in the last column.

In the 1:2 Na+NO3– system,
the first complexation was observed at 1 ns, which slowly increased
to five toward the end of simulation. However, all of the complexes
were observed to appear at the interface (Figure 4a). The partitioning of Na+ was
increased with increasing CE ligand concentration. On the other hand,
for the K+NO3– system, the
complexation of K+ with DB18C6 was observed at 5 ns, whereas
at the end of the simulation, three complexes were placed at the interface,
as indicated by the density profiles (Figure 4b). In the RbNO3 system, the complexation
of Rb+ with DB18C6 was observed after 17 ns (Figure 4c) and in the CsNO3 system, the complexation of Cs+ with DB18C6 was observed
at 23 ns at the interface (Figure 4d).

ion/ligand) ratio. Plots for density profiles of solvents and solutes
for each system are given in the last column.

For the 2:1 Na+NO3– system,
the first complexation of Na+ with DB18C6 was observed
after 7 ns, whereas the second one was observed at 18 ns (Figure 5a). Both the complexes were found to be located near the interface
(Figure 5a). In the
other systems (i.e., K+NO3–, Rb+NO3–, and Cs+NO3–), the complexation of M+ with DB18C6 was observed at the interface and the complexes were
solvated by the nitrobenzene molecules (Figure 5b–d).

systems with (a) Na+NO3– (blue),

ion/ligand) ratio. Plots for density profiles of solvents and solutes
for each system are given in the last column.

To understand the cation exchange phenomena, we considered
different
metal salts in the systems. The MD simulations were carried out with
four metal salts (Na+Cl–, K+Cl–, Rb2+SO4–, and Cs+Cl–) and DB18C6
at the stoichiometric ratios of 1:1 (i.e., 6 M+ and 6 DB18C6),
1:2 (i.e., 6 M+ and 12 DB18C6), and 2:1 (i.e., 12 M+ and 6 DB18C6) (Figures S1–S3, Supporting Information). We notice that the counter anions
do not change the extraction behavior when compared to the same anion,
that is, NO3– (Figures 3–5). Thus in
all cases, Na+ interacts more strongly with DB18C6 at the
interface which can be derived from its higher stoichiometry. This
also reflects in their experimental distribution coefficient in Table 2. It should be noted
that the ionophore affects the extraction process by solvating the
metal ion complex in the nitrobenzene phase which tends to depend
on its dielectric constant, dipole moment, and the H-bonding ability.
The results indicate that the smallest ion Na+ is intrinsically
preferred,16 and it agrees with the large
value of selectivity (4.947) as predicted by COSMO-RS (Table 1).

With respect to phase
separation in Cs+NO3–- and
Rb+NO3–-based systems [Figure 6a,b], the demixing
index λ decreases down to 0.4 after 6.82
and 4.81 ns, respectively. One the other hand, when K+NO3– and Na+NO3– [Figure 6c,d] is
represented as solutes in the system, λ decreases down to 0.4
in only 2.04 and 2.93 ns, respectively. Thus, it implies that an interface
formation is faster for K+- and Na+-based systems
when compared to Cs+ and Rb+ systems. The phase
separation was found to be slower for the Cs+NO3–-based system. This is expected as the solvation
phenomena are known to be stronger in the cesium-based system owing
to its higher concentration of charge. Although all systems demix
readily, the outcome of phase separation depends on the nature and
concentration of the solute.17 In all of
the profiles, λ decreases from 0.9 (mixed state) and approaches
an equilibrium value of 0.4 (separated phases) to well-separated phases
at 40 ns. The final value is not exactly zero because the densities
of the liquids overlap in the interfacial region.17

2.2.2 Structural
Properties of Metal Ions in the
Nitrobenzene–Water Demixing System
The structure of
the solvent molecules around the alkali metal ions is usually obtained
by the RDFs. The RDF plots of the metal ions (i.e., Cs+, K+, Na+, and Rb+) with the oxygen
atoms of CE, nitrobenzene, and water are depicted in Figure 7. A sharp peak in the RDF of
the Cs+–CE complex at 3.25 Å (Figure 7a) indicates the formation
of the complex. The pair correlation function g(r) corresponds to the interaction between the metal ion
and the center of mass of DB18C6 CE. A sharp peak in the RDF of the
Cs+–CE complex at 3.45 Å (Figure 7a) indicates the formation
of the complex. Similarly, sharp peaks of large magnitude between
the metal ions and the oxygen atom of DB18C6 were obtained at 3.05
(Rb+), 2.85 (K+), and 2.23 Å (Na+). Hence, it can be observed that the position of the sharp peaks
changes monotonously with decreasing the ion size from Cs+ to Na+. This indicates the formation of a highly stable
complex (Figure 7a–d)
for all of the metal ions. Similar large peaks between the metal ions
and the oxygen atom of water were obtained at 2.65 (Na+), 3.25 (K+), 3.35 (Rb+), and 3.65 Å (Cs+) (Figure 7). This suggests a reasonably strong association of the metal ions
with water as compared to that with nitrobenzene. In addition, it
was observed that the nitrobenzene molecules formed a well-defined
first solvation shell around the metal ions but a weaker second solvation
shell. This indicates that long-range ordering of the complex was
not possible. The coordination number of the nitrobenzene molecules
in the first solvation shell of the metal ion was obtained by integrating
the M+–O (nitrobenzene) RDFs till the first minimum.
The results are given in Table 3. The coordination numbers (Table 3) of free Cs+, K+,
and Rb+ (i.e., 35.67, 25.84, and 27.92) were much larger
than that of Na+ within the first solvation shell. This
is due to the fact that higher fractions of Cs+, K+, and Rb+ were coordinated with the oxygen atoms
of water. The Na+ ion was found to be surrounded by three
to four oxygen atoms of CE. The higher coordination number of Na+ (i.e., 3.17) than the other metal ions (i.e., K+, Cs+, and Rb+) suggests the formation of complexes
with high stability.

Figure 8 represents
the spatial distribution functions (SDFs) that provide the average
density of different metal ions around a reference CE, water, and
a nitrobenzene molecule. These SDFs are obtained using TRAVIS package.18 The isovalue employed for the SDFs corresponding
to the metal ion–CE is 3.5 particle Å, whereas for the
metal ion–nitrobenzene and metal ion–water, the isovalues
are 0.05 and 0.02 particle Å, respectively. As can be seen, the
more active (“O atom”) side of CE is surrounded by Na+ ion, whereas the less active side of CE surrounds the Cs+ ion. Moreover, the appearance of the distribution of the
Na+ ion around the active side of nitrobenzene is closer
than that of other metal ions. This finding is in accordance with
the RDF plots involving Na+–CE and Na+–nitrobenzene (Figure 7). In specific, the positions of the first peak of these RDFs
appear at 2.23 and 4.16 Å, respectively. Furthermore, Na+ ions are distributed at a distance that is very far from
the water molecule. Therefore, other metal ions (i.e., Cs+, Rb+, and K+) are very closely distributed
around the active sides of the water molecule.

2.3 Explicit
and Implicit Solvent Models
The binding, interaction, and
free energies with the solvents for
free metal ions and the complexes are computed using both explicit
solvent as well as PCM approach. Figure 9 shows the schematic diagram for calculating
the binding and interaction energies in vacuo using explicit and implicit
solvents. Binding energies of the complexed metal ions in vacuo were
calculated by eq 2(19) 2  where ΔECs–CE0, ΔECs0, and ΔECE0 are the energies
of the complex, metal ion,
and CE, respectively, in vacuo. Here, the values of the binding energies
in vacuo were defined based on a thermodynamic cycle. Interaction
energies, ΔEZint(N), were calculated between
the solute Z and the solvent molecules N as per eq 3. 3  

Figure 9 Schematic
diagram of the computational procedure used to calculate
binding and interaction energies in vacuo: explicit and implicit solvent
based on structures obtained from QC calculations.

The superscript, N, represents
the number of solvent
molecules, and 0 indicates their absence. ΔEZ0 and ΔEsolv-Z represent the energy of the solute
in vacuo and the energy of the N solvent molecules
in the geometry of the system (i.e., Z + solvent), respectively. The
calculated binding and free energies of the free and the complexed
metal ions are depicted in Figure 10. From Figure 10a,b, it is clear that the binding and free energies of Na+ (i.e., −163.07 and −162.09 kcal/mol) were higher
than the same for the other free metal ions (i.e., Cs+,
K+, and Rb+) in vacuo. The calculated binding
and free energies for Na+ with CE (i.e., −78.41
and −68.06 kcal/mol, respectively) were also found to be higher
than those of the other complexed metal ions (Figure 10c,d). The binding energy for Na+ with DB18C6 using SDD basis set was higher than those of the other
ions, indicating a higher selectivity of Na+ over the other
metal ions. The binding and free energies for the free and complexed
metal ions in vacuo follow the sequence of selectivity obtained from
COSMO-RS, that is, Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+.

for free metal
ions (a,b) and complexed metal ions (c,d) obtained from QC calculations.

A comparison between the values
of interaction energies obtained
from the explicit solvent model and the PCM is presented in Table 4. The interaction
energies between the solute and the solvent molecules were calculated
by using the difference between the energies obtained in the PCM solvent
and the same in vacuo. The binding energies in the implicit solvent
model were calculated from the energies in the PCM solvent. The binding
energy of the complexed metal ions in the implicit solvent model was
calculated from eq 4. 4

The calculated binding energies for metal ions with
CE in PCM solvents
(i.e., water and nitrobenzene) are presented in Figure 11. The calculated binding energies
of the Na+–CE complex in water (i.e., −67.87
kcal/mol) and nitrobenzene (i.e., −151.03 kcal/mol) were found
to be higher than those of the other complexed metal ions. The binding
energies of K+–CE and Rb+–CE complexes
(i.e., −54.96 and −55.94 kcal/mol, respectively) in
nitrobenzene and water were quite similar (Figure 11a). On the other hand, the calculated binding
energies of Cs+ and Rb+ (i.e., −132.61
and −137.14 kcal/mol, respectively) with CE were quite close
in nitrobenzene (Figure 11b).

water and (b) nitrobenzene (PCM approach) obtained from QC calculations.

The calculated interaction energies
obtained from the MD simulations
and the different solvent models are summarized in Table 4. The implicit solvent model
reduces the stabilization of the complex in water as compared to the
interaction energy in the explicit model (Table 4). The reduction of the implicit solvent
model mainly depends on the dielectric permittivity of the medium.
In both the solvent models, the interaction energy (ΔE) between the Na+–CE complex and nitrobenzene
was found to be higher (i.e., −289.92 and −143.12 kcal/mol)
than those of the other metal ions (i.e., Cs+, K+, and Rb+), indicating the higher selectivity for Na+ over the other metal ions. From the results reported in Table 4, it is clear that
the smallest ion Na+ is intrinsically preferred, in the
order: Na+ > K+ > Rb+ >
Cs+. Hence, the results obtained from the MD simulations
and the explicit
and implicit solvation models on the preferential selectivity of Na+ over other competing metal ions with DB18C6 exactly agree
with the selectivities predicted by COSMO-RS.

Overall, we have
used MD combined with quantum mechanics (QM) to
calculate the interaction energies of the complex with the solvents.
We have compared the predictions of explicit and implicit solvation
models and have related them to the structures observed in MD trajectories.
The optimized potential for liquid simulation force field, which includes
the bonded, van der Waals, and electrostatic interactions, is used
in MD to calculate interaction energies, whereas QM calculations are
based on all-electron ab initio approach. Results were averaged over
about 1000 structures (last 5 ns of the MD trajectory). Interaction
energies of the complex with solvents observed in MD differ with the
predictions of the QM model. We suggest that this discrepancy results
from the structure of the complex used in explicit solvent calculations
at the optimal geometry, whereas the coordination of the complex with
solvent molecules as observed from simulations is different. Further,
the PCM interaction energies depend on the dielectric permittivity
of the medium and polarity of the liquid. We conclude that the differences
between MD simulations and the predictions of the QM model can be
attributed to the structure of the studied systems as well as the
fundamental level of approach is different.

3 Conclusions
This paper reports experimental studies combined
with COSMO-RS
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the intermolecular
interactions between the solute and the solvent (i.e., nitrobenzene
and water). A comparison has been made between the interaction energies
computed using both explicit and implicit solvent models. The sigma
profiles of the metal ions and their complexes were used to understand
the miscibility of the components. From the experimental data, it
has been shown that the distribution constant of the Na+ ion is found to be higher than those of the other metal ions in
the nitrobenzene–water binary mixture, which is in good agreement
with the COSMO-RS predictions at three different temperatures. The
calculated interaction energies for the Na+–CE complex
with nitrobenzene obtained by MD and QC were also found to be higher
than those for other metal ion complexes. While on one end, COMSO-RS
gave a qualitative aspect for the distribution coefficient, on the
other end, the experimental and MD- or QC-predicted interaction energies
validated the COSMO-RS phenomena. The selectivities of the metal ions
predicted by COSMO-RS decreased with increasing metal ion size in
the sequence: Na+ > K+ > Rb+ > Cs+. The higher binding and interaction energies
for the Na+–CE complex indicated the higher selectivity
of Na+ over the other metal ions, which complemented well
with the
COSMO-RS predictions.

4 Computational Details
4.1 COSMO-RS Model
The COSMO-RS method
has been extensively used to predict thermodynamic properties of fluids
and liquid mixtures. The COSMO-RS method was first reported by Klamt11 and co-workers.10,20 In the COSMO-RS
model, the interactions of the molecular surfaces are determined by
an interaction energy function, which depends on the screening charge
densities. The screening charges are developed when the solute is
placed in the midst of a conductor. The screening charges so produced
are unique for each solute, and they are depicted in the form of histogram
or probabilistic distributions. This probability distribution is estimated
by the sigma profile11 5  Here, Ai(σ)
is the total surface area of the segment with a charge density σ,
and Ai is the total surface area of the
entire solute. The activity coefficient of a molecule is then obtained
by reducing the information for predicting segment potential using
a statistical mechanical framework. The global adjustable parameters
such as the surface area of the segment (aeff = 6.32 Å2), the hydrogen-bonding interaction constant
(cHB = 75 006 kcal A4/(mol e2)), and the cutoff for hydrogen-bonding interaction
(σHB = 0.0084 e/Å2) are then subsequently
used for the activity coefficient predictions.21 In this work, the initial COSMO files were generated by
the BVP86/TZVP/DFT level of theory.22 These
files contain the screening charge densities of the molecule concerned.
These screening charges are then clubbed together in the form of sigma
profile which is probabilistic in nature (eq 5). The information within the sigma profile
is then used to compute the activity coefficient using a statistical
thermodynamic framework (RS).10−14 The equations and methodology are available in our earlier reported
prediction on the COSMO-RS model.14 All
of the calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 package.

4.2 Quantum Calculation
The structures
of all molecules were drawn using the molecule visualization and editing
program Gauss View 5.0, whereas the geometry was optimized by B3LYP
in Gaussian 09 package. The frequency was estimated by using the freq command by B3LYP/SDD/DFT level of theory.23 The individual solutes in the implicit solvent
model (PCM) were optimized with the same functional theory and SDD(+)
basis.23 The single-point energy calculations
were carried out at the MP2/SDD(+)/PCM level.

4.3 Molecular
Dynamics
The MD simulations
were performed by NAMD,24 version 2.9,
where the potential energy is given by 6  

The first three terms denote the sum
of bond, angle, and dihedral energies. The last term corresponds to
the sum of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the
nonbonded atoms. The parameters for nitrobenzene were taken from an
earlier work.25,26 The parameters for metal ions
(i.e., Cs+, K+, Na+, and Rb+) were reported by Joung and Cheatham,27 whereas the same for the nitrate ion was obtained from Lopes et
al.28 We have used the TIP3P model29 for water. The force field parameter for DB18C6
was taken from Sahu et al.30 and Weiner
et al.31 The atomic charges were regressed
by the CHELPG method,32 whereas the nonbonded
interactions were calculated using a 12 Å atom-based cutoff.
The solutions were represented with three-dimensional periodic boundary
conditions, whereby alternating slabs of water and nitrobenzene are
observed in the case of biphasic systems.33

The MD simulations were performed at 300 K in the (NVT) ensemble.
The temperature and pressure were controlled by Langevin thermostat
and Langevin piston, respectively. The simulated systems are provided
in Table 5. The systems
were subjected to 10 000 steps of energy minimization followed
by equilibration in NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm. The total time
of the simulation was kept at 2 ns. All of the bond lengths were constrained
by SHAKE, and the Verlet algorithm was used to integrate the equations
of motion. Snapshots for the trajectory were taken from VMD software.34 The densities of nitrobenzene (ρni) and water (ρw) were plotted as a function of the z-coordinate. The phase separation as a function of time
was described by the demixing index (λ). This value ranges from
1 (for a perfectly mixed system) to 0 (for completely separated phases). 7  Here, N is the normalization
factor.

5 Experiments for Determining
Metal Ion Distribution
5.1 Reagents and Solutions
DB18C6, >98%
assay, was purchased from Alfa Aesar. DB18C6 solution (0.1 M) in nitrobenzene
(AR grade, SDFine make) was prepared by dissolving 3.604 g of CE in
100 mL of nitrobenzene. Analytical-grade sodium chloride (Chemco Fine
Chemicals), potassium chloride (Thomas Baker), rubidium sulfate (Merck),
and cesium chloride (Sisco Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.) were used
for preparing 0.1 M of individual alkali metal ion (Na/K/Rb/Cs) solution
by dissolving an appropriate amount of the above alkali metal salts
in acidified water. Millipore water (a resistivity of 18.2 mΩ·cm)
was used in all experiments.

5.2 Solvent Extraction Studies
The organic
phase was prepared by diluting 0.1 M DB18C6 to 0.01 M DB18C6 in nitrobenzene.
The 0.1 M alkali metal ion solution was used as the aqueous phase.
Each 5 mL of the aqueous and the organic phases was stirred at 800
rpm using a multiposition stirrer (make: IKA, model: RT 10 POWER MAG).
Then, the solution mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min until the
phases clearly separated. The extraction experiments were carried
out at four-metal to CE ligand mole ratios: 10:1 (i.e., 0.1 M M+ and 0.01 M DB18C6), 1:1 (i.e., 0.01 M M+ and 0.01
M DB18C6), and 1:10 (i.e., 0.001 M M+ and 0.01 M DB18C6).
The distribution coefficient was determined by comparing the metal
ion concentrations in the aqueous phases before and after extraction.
An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, developed at TPD,
Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Mumbai, India), was employed to estimate
the alkali metal ion concentration in the aqueous phase after appropriate
dilution. Equation 8 was
used for calculating the distribution coefficient (D). 8  where Corg and Caq are the concentrations of the extracted alkali
metal ion in the organic phase and the retained alkali metal ion in
the aqueous phase, respectively. Co and Ce are the initial and final concentrations of
the alkali metal ion in the aqueous phase, respectively. Vaq is the volume of the aqueous phase, and Vorg is the volume of the organic phase. The values of D for DB18C6 are reported in Table 2.
