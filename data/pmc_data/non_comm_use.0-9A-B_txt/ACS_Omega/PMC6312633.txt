In
the presence of zinc, the protein tubulin assembles into two-dimensional
sheets that are a useful model system for the study of both tubulin
and microtubule structure. Tubulin sheets present an ideal protein
structure for study with atomic force microscopy because they contain
a two-dimensional crystalline protein lattice and retain many of the
structural features of tubulin and microtubules. However, high-resolution
imaging requires nonperturbative immobilization onto an appropriate
imaging substrate. In this report, several substrates commonly used
for scanning probe microscopy are evaluated for their ability to effectively
immobilize tubulin sheets: mica, gold, highly ordered pyrolytic graphite,
and carbon-coated electron microscopy grids. We hypothesize that the
different intermolecular interactions presented by these substrates
will affect the morphology of adsorbed tubulin sheets as well as the
amount of other contaminating adsorbates. Tubulin sheets were successfully
imaged on all of these substrates and structural characterization
is reported. The most consistent results were obtained on carbon-coated
electron microscopy grids, which preserved fine structural features
of the sheets and had the least amount of contamination from the adsorption
of unpolymerized tubulin. Images of tubulin sheets obtained with atomic
force microscopy also compare favorably with published electron micrographs
of sheets produced using similar procedures. This work demonstrates
the importance of assessing substrate effects when studying two-dimensional
protein crystals and identifies suitable substrates for immobilizing
tubulin sheets.

Introduction
Tubulin is an important
cytoskeletal protein that is the primary
component of microtubules, essential intracellular structures responsible
for a wide variety of functions in eukaryotic cells.1 As such, tubulin plays a role in intracellular transport,
mitosis and meiosis, and as one of the key components of the cytoskeleton.
Microtubules are the most common and important form of polymeric tubulin,
in which the protein is arranged into rodlike protofilaments, which
are associated laterally to form a hollow tube. However, in vitro
tubulin has demonstrated the unique ability to polymerize into a wider
variety of lesser known morphologies, including rings, ribbons, macrotubules,
and sheets.2−15 Many of these polymeric structures have been important in developing
an understanding of the tubulin and microtubule structure, for example,
identifying factors influencing the straight versus bent conformation
of protofilaments2−4 or the solution of the tubulin crystal structure.16 The present work focuses on immobilization of
these two-dimensional (2D) crystals on solid supports for study with
scanning probe microscopy and the resultant structural changes induced
by substrate effects.

The assembly of tubulin into 2D crystals
induced by the presence
of zinc was first reported in 19765 and
has been the subject of numerous studies over the past 40 years.7−16 Although they have no known function in vivo, tubulin sheets have
been essential in the study of microtubules. Because there are only
minor differences in the tubulin structure in sheets compared to microtubules
and because the protofilaments are nearly identical in both structures,
sheets constitute a convenient and appealing system that has been
exploited to study both dimeric and polymeric tubulin. The most successful
experimental application for tubulin sheets was their use for electron
crystallography which resulted in the determination of the atomic-resolution
structure of tubulin.16,17 This molecular structure was
subsequently combined with high-resolution cryoelectron micrographs
of whole microtubules to construct an atomic resolution model of the
microtubule18 which has proven invaluable
in developing the current understanding of the microtubule structure
and assembly. More recently, tubulin sheets have been used to study
the motility of motor proteins,19 as an
important control in the study of tubulin acetylation20 and as nanoscale templates for patterned deposition of
nanoparticles.21,22

Because tubulin sheets
are such an attractive experimental system,
we are investigating their use as model structures in the study of
tubulin and polymeric tubulin with atomic force microscopy (AFM).
AFM is an effective approach for the study of tubulin, yet has focused
primarily on microtubules,23−31 for both structural and mechanical characterization. However, the
cylindrical nature of the microtubule complicates AFM measurements,
as the perturbative nature of AFM imaging tends to destroy immobilized
microtubules, high-resolution imaging on the tightly curved surface
of the microtubule is extremely challenging, and interpreting mechanical
measurements requires the use of sophisticated modeling strategies
such as finite element modeling.30,31 Although other
nonmicrotubule tubulin polymers have been studied with AFM,4,32 we know of only a small number of reports of tubulin sheets studied
with AFM.21,22 Thus, AFM represents a novel approach that
may yield new information about the structure, mechanics, and function
of tubulin.

Tubulin sheets are a nearly ideal system for AFM
because of their
crystallinity and ability to lie uniformly on an imaging substrate,
both of which greatly facilitate imaging with scanning probe microscopies.
Also, the tubulin and protofilament substructure ordinarily present
in microtubules are intact, allowing the use of sheets as model substrates
for structural and physical characterization of protofilaments. The
smoothness of the sheets may ultimately allow for higher resolution
AFM imaging than is usually possible on the highly curved surface
of microtubules. 2D protein crystals in general have provided some
of the best and highest resolution AFM images of proteins because
they enable detailed analysis of images through, for example, image
averaging or Fourier analysis. AFM has been used to study substrate-supported
transmembrane proteins in buffer,33−35 2D streptavidin crystals
that selectively immobilize individual protein complexes,36 and ligand-induced gating of ion channels.37 Often in these studies, buffer pH and ionic
strength are used to tune interactions of the 2D crystals with the
substrate surface, thus allowing optimization of both immobilization
and image quality.

Zn-induced tubulin sheets present a similarly
uniform 2D protein
crystal surface that is a very suitable surface for high-resolution
imaging with AFM. However, they provide a unique challenge because
their morphology depends on both buffer pH and ionic strength. Specifically,
low pH is required to preferentially form sheets instead of tubes,15 and large, uniform sheets may require high salt
concentration.6 With this consideration,
conditions favorable for sheet assembly in solution do not necessarily
correspond to conditions favorable for sheet immobilization on solid
substrates.

Thus, the goal of the current work is to study the
adsorption and
immobilization of tubulin sheets for AFM imaging and to examine structural
changes induced by substrate binding. The ideal substrate would exhibit
the following characteristics: relatively smooth over large, micrometer-sized
areas; strong but nonperturbative physical adsorption of the protein
sheets; and preferential adsorption of sheets over other contaminants
from solution, including unpolymerized tubulin. Toward this end, three
substrates commonly used for scanning probe imaging38 were investigated: mica, gold, and highly ordered pyrolytic
graphite (HOPG). Additionally, to allow direct comparison with previous
electron microscopy (EM) work, we examined tubulin sheets immobilized
on carbon-based EM grids. Below, we describe the characteristics of
these substrates, practical limitations for their use, and the structure
of adsorbed sheets following immobilization. This work provides a
basis for the development of new methods of structural and mechanical
interrogation of tubulin sheets affording greater flexibility in the
types of studies of tubulin that can be accomplished with AFM.

Results
and Discussion
For a direct comparison of sheet immobilization
on the four substrates
used in this study, Figure 1 presents representative 3 μm images of tubulin sheets
on mica, gold, HOPG, and a carbon EM grid. Additionally, the relative
roughness of each substrate can be assessed more quantitatively using
the 2D line profiles depicted in Figure 2A–D, which were taken from the images
in Figure 1A–D
at the positions indicated by the horizontal line in each image. In
these data, tubulin sheet growth solutions were stabilized with paclitaxel
post-assembly and then deposited on the respective substrates. While
tubulin sheets were observed on all substrates, differences between
the morphologies of both the sheets and the underlying substrate are
evident.

image, the horizontal line indicates the position of the 2D line profile
represented in Figure 2. (A) Mica substrate, with arrows indicating the position of some
of the pits in the tubulin coating; (B) gold substrate; (C) HOPG substrate,
with arrows indicating holes in adsorbed sheets; and (D) carbon EM
substrate.

corresponding to mica,
gold, HOPG, and EM substrates, respectively. The lines were flattened
to improve the long-range linearity of the baseline using an iterative
polynomial baseline correction.

The mica substrate (Figures 1A and 2A) presents a very smooth,
uniform,
and easily prepared substrate that is often ideal as a substrate for
imaging proteins.34,38 However, in this work, it was
difficult to adsorb selectively only tubulin sheets on mica, as conditions
favorable for growth and immobilization of tubulin sheets often resulted
in a nearly uniform coating of small tubulin polymers or unpolymerized
tubulin. As depicted in Figure 1A, the mica is covered with a pitted layer, and the locations
of a few of the pits are indicated in Figure 1A with arrows. Scratching experiments (Supporting Information Figure S1) revealed that
this layer is about 5 nm thick, consistent with a single layer of
tubulin. The pits may arise from an incomplete coating of tubulin
or partial dewetting of the protein layer, as described below. The
measured heights of the tubulin sheets are ∼6–7 nm above
the adsorbed layer.

The gold surface (Figures 1B and 2B) has a granular
structure
typical of gold evaporated on silicon. The roughness is evident in
the 2D line profile (Figure 2B) and on the surface of the sheets, indicating that they
are flexible enough to adopt the structure of the underlying substrate.
Imaging of the tubulin sheets on gold was the most inconsistent of
all of the substrates examined.

To image tubulin sheets, a 40-fold
dilution of the sheet growth
solution was required, while on the other substrates, acceptable imaging
conditions could be obtained with minimal or no dilution of the sheet
growth solution. Attempts to image sheets without dilution resulted
in a surface covered by large aggregates on the surface.

On
HOPG (Figure 1C), a
networked or web-like surface coating can be observed, which
is characteristic of a hydrophobic surface interacting with proteins.
An analogous morphology has been observed previously for collagen
on HOPG,39 collagen on polystyrene,40 and for albumin on polystyrene.41 These network-like protein films are thought to arise from
the hydrophobic interaction between the substrate and protein, which
causes strong adsorption of the protein and then allows for subsequent
dewetting of the proteinaceous layer during drying steps. As depicted
in Figure 2C, the network
layer is ∼2–4 nm in thickness, while the sheets are
∼5–7 nm in height above this layer. Evidence of possible
damage to a sheet caused by dewetting can also be observed as holes
developing in one of the sheets in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Higher resolution 2D line profile (A) and a
1.5 μm ×
1.5 μm image (B) of a tubulin sheet immobilized on a carbon
EM substrate.

The most consistent and
reproducible results were obtained on the
carbon EM grid (Figures 1D and 2D). Following exposure to the sheet
growth solution, the EM grid appears to have minimal adsorption of
the unpolymerized protein on the substrate surface. The measured thickness
of the sheets adsorbed on the EM grid is similar to that on the mica
and HOPG, ∼5–7 nm for a single sheet. Compared to the
other substrates, fine, delicate features of the sheets are most evident
on the EM grid. There are many small, thin fragments and the sheets
themselves have thin, ribbon-like protrusions, presumably single or
groups of protofilaments. In contrast, on the other three substrates,
the edges of the sheets are typically blunt, without protruding protofilaments.
The existence of the more delicate structures observed on the EM grid
implies that these sheets are most representative of those in the
deposition solution and that there are less substrate-induced structural
changes on the EM grid than on the mica, gold, or HOPG.

In both Figure 1C,D, the underlying
substrates do not appear flat but rather with
broad (hundreds of nanometers wide) protrusions and depressions. This
was a feature that we occasionally observed on the carbon transmission
EM (TEM) grids, which we attribute to deformation in the thin carbon
film. In general, over the range of tens of micrometer, the TEM grids
did not present a flat surface, with significant distortions around
the copper mesh that supported the carbon film. However, in local
areas centered between the mesh, appropriately flat areas could be
found for AFM imaging. On HOPG, the broad protrusions observed in Figure 1C may be caused by
terracing/steps in the underlying substrate. The presence of multiple
steps/terraces was a feature frequently observed on bare substrates.

Higher resolution imaging of the EM grid (Figure 3) provides a better picture of the relative
amount of nonspecific protein adsorption typical on this substrate.
While the surface is not completely devoid of the unpolymerized protein,
the amount of surface coating is much less than was observed on the
mica and is distinct from that which was observed on the HOPG. The
2D line profile provided in Figure 3A shows this adsorbed protein to be ∼2 nm in
thickness and reveals that the surface of the sheet has a roughness
similar to the underlying substrate. This is analogous to that which
was observed on the gold surface, indicating that the sheets are flexible
enough to adopt the topography of the surface on which they are adsorbed.
Also evident are some small tubulin aggregates on the sheet surface.

On the basis of the data presented above, the dominant surface–protein
interaction not only influences the characteristics of the adsorbed
protein layer but also affects the morphology of the sheets immobilized
on the surface. The substrates tested here represent ends of a range
between hydrophilic (mica and gold) and more hydrophobic (HOPG and
carbon EM grid). When cleaved, the layered structure of mica exposes
an atomically smooth surface which, when placed in water at neutral
pH, has a net negative charge. This surface is very amenable to electrostatic
interaction with charged proteins34 such
that in our case, the entire mica surface is coated with a disordered
layer of the protein. Conversely, HOPG presents a hydrophobic surface
where the dominant protein-to-surface interaction is via dispersion
interactions, which leads to orientations of adsorbed proteins at
the surface distinct from that of mica41 and precludes substantial hydration of the protein at the surface.
This is further exacerbated during drying steps where the proteinaceous
layer is dehydrated and dewets into the observed network pattern.42 The relative wettability/hydrophobicity of the
substrates was assessed using static contact angle measurements (values
reported in Supporting Information, Table
1). On the basis of macroscopic contact angles of water droplets on
the surface, the carbon EM substrate is more hydrophobic than HOPG.
The EM grid substrate has a chemical composition that is distinct
from HOPG, as it consists of a carbon thin film that presents a relatively
smooth, but probably amorphous, surface made up of a mixture of microdomains
of diamond-like and graphitic carbon.43 At the scale of single protein adsorption, there are a wider variety
of functional groups which allow for more stable adsorption of tubulin
and much less dewetting of the adsorbed protein upon drying of the
samples.

Paclitaxel is a drug that is known for its ability
to induce polymerization
of tubulin and stabilize tubulin polymers such as microtubules and
tubulin sheets and is commonly used in vitro to produce tubulin polymers
that are stable at room temperature. To evaluate the effects of paclitaxel
stabilization on sheet growth and structure, some sheets were examined
where paclitaxel was added prior to incubation and growth. Figure 4A,B depicts these
solutions deposited on mica. The sheets are narrower and more multilayered
than those stabilized using paclitaxel addition post-assembly, and
several of the structures in Figure 4A have multiple layers that are aligned in the direction
of the major axis of the polymer. The most likely explanation for
this structure is that some sheets have rolled up into large tubes
or “macrotubules” similar to those reported previously
from sheet assembly at high pH.15 A closer
examination of the proteinaceous layer coating the mica (Figure 4B) also shows what
appear to be small, polymeric assemblies of tubulin, most on the order
of 50–100 nm in length. The presence of numerous small polymers
is consistent with the rapid nucleation of tubulin polymers induced
by paclitaxel.44 Also, consistent with
our observations of sheets on gold (Figure 1B) and the EM grid (Figures 1D and 3), the surface
structure of the sheet or macrotubule has adopted a roughness similar
to the underlying substrate.

prior to sheet
growth and then immobilized on mica for imaging. (A) 3 μm ×
3 μm image and (B) 500 nm × 500 nm image.

In addition to our primary goal of assessing the
functionality
of the various substrates, we also compared AFM data with previously
published EM data. For direct comparison with reported electron micrographs,
sheets were produced under conditions optimized for EM.6 Deposition of these aqueous samples onto mica
substrates most often resulted in large aggregates of hundreds of
nanometer in apparent height and width. These aggregates were present
even in the best samples (Figure 5A) and when sheets were present. However, sheets can
be observed in relatively low density on the substrate between aggregates
(Figure 5A,B). The
sizes of these sheets were up to several hundred nanometers in width,
which can be compared with sheets prepared with a similar protocol
for EM, which were reported to be up to several micrometers in width.
Compared to our standard sheet growth protocol, the mica surface was
much cleaner when we used these growth conditions. This is not surprising,
given that the longer growth times used in this method may simply
produce higher yield of polymerized tubulin such that the concentration
of free tubulin is too low to noticeably contaminate the mica surface
and the higher ionic strength of the growth solution reduces electrostatic
interactions between the protein and substrate, correspondingly reducing
the adsorption of free protein.

Figure 5 Images of sheets immobilized on mica from
a growth using longer
incubation time and high ionic strength buffer.

When determining the best conditions for assembly of tubulin
sheets
for this work, we developed a procedure that, in our lab, produced
the most consistent and interpretable AFM data and a procedure that
is well within the range of growth conditions previously reported.
A survey of the literature reporting assembly of zinc-induced tubulin
sheets reveals a wide range of polymerization conditions. This includes
the use of piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic
acid) or 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer,
with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 100 mM, tubulin concentrations
ranging from 0.6 to 10 mg/mL, pH ranging from 5 to 6.8, temperature
ranging from room temperature to 37 °C, and growth times from
minutes to 24 h. On the basis of the wide range of conditions that
have been used historically, we infer that the mere presence of zinc-induced
sheets in solution depends only on the presence of zinc but that the
yield, number, quality, shape, and uniformity of the sheets depend
on growth conditions such that careful control over growth conditions
is necessary to produce the largest crystalline sheets.6,15

Unpolymerized tubulin or small tubulin oligomers were consistently
present in most of the samples we analyzed and resulted in adsorbed
tubulin layers along with our adsorbed sheets. A simple model of our
surfaces with sheets adsorbed is presented in Figure 6, showing the sheets adsorbed over a nearly
uniform layer of tubulin that was observed on mica, gold, and the
TEM grid (Figure 6B)
or the sheets adsorbed over a dewetted layer of the protein that was
observed on graphite (Figure 6A).

Figure 6 Simple model of the deposition conditions and adsorption structures
observed. (A) Prior to deposition, the solution contains tubulin sheets,
as well as numerous small tubulin oligomers and free tubulin. (B)
After deposition on mica, gold, and the TEM grid, the substrate is
coated with a nearly uniform tubulin layer, with sheets overlaid on
this layer. (C) On the HOPG substrate, the tubulin layer dewets into
a network-like pattern.

Figures 1, 4, and 5 can be used to directly
compare some of the growth methods that we tested. Our standard protocol
(Figure 1) yielded
sheets that were typically rectangular in shape, containing a long
axis with relatively straight edges. This type of structure is consistent
with previous EM work that used similar growth conditions (see for
example, Figure 2 in ref (2)), with the long axis corresponding to the orientation of
protofilaments in the sheet. In contrast, when sheets were polymerized
using long growth times and higher ionic strength, the overall shape
of the sheets was less uniform and often did not contain one obvious
long axis (Figure 5). This is consistent with morphologies reported previously (for
example, see Figure 2 in ref (15)).

Conclusions
We have examined sheets
of the protein tubulin immobilized on a
variety of substrates and have examined a range of experimental conditions
for producing these sheets to study the effect of adsorption substrate
and growth conditions on the structure of the sheets. The best substrate
for visualization of the sheets with AFM was found to be carbon EM
grids, which show low levels of contamination and preserve fine structural
features of the sheets. The general structure of the tubulin sheets
also compared favorably to published images of the structures produced
with TEM. Consistent immobilization and imaging of tubulin sheets
should allow the pursuit of a more detailed biophysical characterization
of tubulin with AFM and enhance the range of work that can be approached
with the technique. Future work in this area could include high-resolution
imaging to observe changes in tubulin conformation induced by binding
of chemical ligands or other proteins or mechanical characterization
of polymeric tubulin without being limited to characterization of
microtubules.

Methods
Purified, lyophilized tubulin
was purchased from Cytoskeleton,
Inc. AFM tips were silicon microlevers (NCH, Nanoworld Innovative
Technologies) with nominal spring constants of 42 N/m. The substrates
used in these experiments were mica (grade V-1, Electron Microscopy
Sciences), carbon-coated TEM grids consisting of a copper grid coated
with amorphous carbon (Cu-400CK, Pacific Grid Tech), gold-on-silicon
(AU.1000, Platypus Technologies), and HOPG (SPI-2 grade, Structure
Probe, Inc.). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Prior to use, tubulin was dissolved in BRB80 buffer (80 mM K-Pipes,
1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.85) at 10 mg/mL and used immediately or snap-frozen and stored
at −80 °C. For growth of sheets, a wide range of solution
growth conditions were tested, including concentrations of Zn2+ ranging from 0.1 to 5 mM, tubulin from 0.4 to 4 mg/mL, NaCl
from 0 to 200 mM, pH from 4.7 to 6.0, and incubation temperature from
25 to 37 °C. The most consistent results for sheet growth were
obtained by diluting tubulin to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL
into sheet growth buffer [50 mM MES, 1 mM EGTA, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM ZnCl2, and 1 mg/mL guanosine 5′-triphosphate
(GTP), pH 5.0], followed by incubation at 33 °C for 30 min. Tubulin
sheets were stabilized with paclitaxel (0.025 mM), added immediately
after sheet growth. In some cases, paclitaxel was added to the mixture
prior to incubation to assess its effects on sheet growth. Samples
were diluted to concentrations appropriate for imaging in BRB80 containing
0.025 mM paclitaxel.

Some previous work has demonstrated that
long growth times (up
to 24 h) and high ionic strength buffer (up to 200 mM) may be necessary
to produce the highest quality, large tubulin sheets.6 In accord with this work, several experiments were attempted
where tubulin sheets were polymerized using 4 mg/mL tubulin in buffer
containing 80 mM MES, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 1.25 mM ZnSO4, 3 mM GTP, pH 5.3, with 100–200 mM NaCl, and incubated for
24 h at 32 °C.

Gold substrates were prepared by rinsing
with ethanol and acetone
followed by a 30 min exposure in a custom-built UV-ozone chamber containing
an ozone-producing UV grid lamp (BHK, Inc, Ontario, CA). Mica and
HOPG were freshly cleaved before every use. Carbon EM substrates were
used as received. All substrates were affixed to a metal AFM specimen
disc using a minimal amount of Krazy Glue. Aqueous solutions containing
sheets were deposited on the substrates for 1–2 min and then
blown dry with nitrogen gas. AFM imaging was conducted with a Veeco
Multimode Nanoscope IIIa operating in tapping mode. To assess uniformity
of the samples, typically ∼10 images were collected on each
substrate at different locations. Each successful imaging condition
was repeated at least three times to confirm reproducibility of the
samples. Representative images are presented herein.

On two
samples, scratching experiments were conducted to assess
the thickness of adsorbed layers of the protein. The protein was removed
from a small area of the surface by imaging in contact mode at a relatively
high force, corresponding to a deflection setpoint of 2 V read by
the AFM photodetector with a cantilever with a nominal spring constant
of 42 N/m (RTESP-300, Bruker AFM Probes). The depth of the resulting
hole was then assessed by reimaging the larger surrounding area in
tapping mode.

Initial characterization of the substrates prior
to protein deposition
was done using contact angle measurements and AFM characterization
of the freshly prepared substrates. Static contact angles of ∼2
μL drops of water were measured using a ramé-hart model
190 contact angle goniometer and DROPimage CA software. Surface roughness
was assessed from AFM images of small (4–25 μm2) areas of each surface by calculating Ra (average roughness) and Rrms (rms roughness)
using the NanoScope AFM Analysis software. Results of these surface
characterizations are reported in the Supporting Information.
