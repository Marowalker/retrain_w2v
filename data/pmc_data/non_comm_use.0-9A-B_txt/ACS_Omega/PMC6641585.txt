Hydrothermal-assisted
CuS hierarchical architectures were grown
in the presence of anionic sulfur sources, and the investigation of
their degradation efficiency for a pesticide 4-chlorophenol (4-CP)
under visible light irradiation was carried out. The dissociation
of S2– from the sulfur compound governs the nucleation
of CuS followed by a specific pattern of growth to produce different
morphologies. The self-assembled covellite spherical CuS flower architecture
assembles in the presence of thiourea and exhibits the highest photodegradation
activity. The open architecture of ∼2.3 μm spherical
CuS flowers consisting of a ∼100 nm thick sheet encompasses
a comparatively high surface area and particle growth along the (110)
plane that facilitates more active sites for catalytic activity enhancement.
The catalyst loading for 4-CP degradation has been optimized, and
a detailed trapping mechanism has been explored.

1 Introduction
High resistance of organic
contaminants toward the conventional
biological and chemical treatments demands a sustainable approach
for treatment of wastewater to facilitate the recycling and reuse
of wastewater.1 The advanced treatment
technologies such as chemical precipitation, adsorption, advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs), electrochemical oxidation, and membrane
processes are efficiently able to destroy the persistent organic pollutants.2,3 Recent research focuses on the heterogeneous photocatalytic AOPs
for its enhanced degradation efficiency with generation of benign
products nonselectively.4 AOPs require
light for photocatalysis to enhance the activity through Fenton process.5 The catalytic efficiency of the photo-Fenton
process is pH-dependent as the precipitate dissolves at pH below 2.8
for the formation of active [Fe(OH)]2+ species. The refinement
of pH requires high chemical overheads that restrict its utility.6 Semiconducting metal oxides and sulfides have
been extensively researched in the recent years.7−10 Among them, copper based-chalcogenides
impart unique physical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties
with synergistic contribution in the field of optoelectronic devices,
energy storage, biosensors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, and
photocatalysis.11−13

Covellite CuS is an interesting material that
has been recognized
owing to its ability to absorb solar spectra in the visible region.
The micro/nano-CuS semiconductor has been explored for the degradation
of organic dyes.14,15 Basu et al. reported the disintegration
of different organic dye pollutants through hexagonal-stacked CuS
plates under indoor lighting.16 CuS-caved
superstructures were fabricated by Shu et al. for dye degradation.17 Dye degradation was also performed by CuS nanofibers
that were synthesized with the assistance of polyacrylonitrile.18 A chemically dealloyed CuS photocatalyst was
investigated for the photodegradation of azo dyes.19 The photocatalytic efficiency of these copper chalcogenides
depends on factors such as material design (morphology, size, and
surface area), tuning optical absorption, and surface modification
by doping or forming heterojunctions.20,21 To achieve
the desired property, strategies toward synthesis also play a pivotal
role.22 To control the design of materials,
efforts have been made through methodologies such as coprecipitation,
solvothermal synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, and hot injection.23,24 The hierarchical self-assembled structures enhance the performance
of materials through micro- or nano-sized building blocks.25 Therefore, the investigation of hierarchical
semiconductor microarchitectures built from nano building blocks is
of utmost significance for both scientific and industrial applications.
Studies report that the different sulfur sources in varying base precursors
of copper (nitrates, chlorides, and acetates) forms versatile microstructures.9,26,27 However, a comparative morphology-driven
photocatalytic study of CuS, derived from a common precursor with
different sulfur sources, has not been reported.

Considering
the gradient of major pollutants other than dyes, chlorinated
phenols pose a serious threat to ecological system as they are toxic,
suspected to be carcinogenic, and recalcitrant.28,29 Among the chlorinated phenols, 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) is a potential
toxin that has direct relevance to the environmental pollution.30 The impact of material designing onto photocatalytic
degradation of 4-CP has not been reported before. The present investigation
has been directed toward the design of different CuS photocatalysts
by a facile hydrothermal method by using different sulfur sources,
and the study of their morphological evolution was carried out. The
as-prepared CuS photocatalysts have been evaluated for the photocatalytic
activity toward degradation of 4-CP under visible light illumination.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural, Morphological,
and Optical Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the synthesized CuS powders,
designated as CuS-ST, CuS-TA, and CuS-TU, are presented in Figure 1a, which provides
an insight to the crystallinity, purity, and phase of the products.
All of the diffraction peaks could be well-indexed to the hexagonal
covellite CuS crystal phase that matches well with the JCPDS card
no. 24-0060 having cell parameters, a = b = 3.796 Å and c = 16.360 Å and a space
group of P63/mmc. The
intense and sharp diffraction peaks are obtained that suggest high
crystallinity of the powders. From the XRD patterns, it is evident
that the resultant product of CuS-ST has a phase mixture of hexagonal
covellite and cubic digenite (Cu2S, 02-1287, marked as
# in the figure), whereas CuS-TA and CuS-TU do not have any other
phase that suggests high purity of both the powders synthesized by
thioacetamide and thiourea sources, respectively. The formation of
Cu2S can be attributed to desulfurization of CuS to Cu2S under high pressure.31 The covellite
peaks of CuS-TU have been indexed to (100), (101), (102), (103), (006),
(104), (110), (108), and (118). Although there is no peak shifting,
it could be observed that the peaks obtained for CuS-TU are sharper
than the peaks obtained for both CuS-ST and CuS-TU, which indicates
that the particles are highly crystalline in CuS-TU. A thorough examination
of the diffraction pattern reveals that the diffraction intensity
of the peak (103) is lower than that in the standard JCPDS pattern.
However, the intensity of (110) peak in particular is very high, which
is indicative of the preferred growth along the (110) plane in the
crystalline powder. This particular plane can be attributed to have
played a major role in the morphology formation, which can be further
understood from the detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
analysis.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns with varying directing agents (CuS-ST, CuS-TA,
and CuS-TU) and (b) composite Raman spectra of CuS microstructures.

Atomic vibrational modes identifying
the surface species and spatial
variations in composition are known from Raman measurement of the
samples. Typical Raman spectra of the as-prepared powders are shown
in Figure 1b. All of
the spectra show a sharp and intense peak at 473 cm–1, which can correspond to the vibrational mode from covalent S–S
bonds of S2 ions at the 4e sites.32 This sharp peak indicates that the lattice atoms are aligned in
the periodic array. Other than this sharp peak, a broad Raman peak
at 266 cm–1 is observed that is due to the vibration
from Cu–S bond. An additional peak is also observed in the
Raman spectra of CuS-ST at wavenumber of 322 cm–1, which can be assigned to the Cu2–xS (where, x varies from 0, 6 ≤ x ≤ 1) phonon mode as Raman scattering is sensitive
toward the defect crystal phases.33 In
the present case, the value of x = 0, as also observed
from the XRD analysis. The Raman data support the formation of pure
structure of CuS in CuS-TA and CuS-TU and also support the formation
of defect Cu2S in CuS-ST.

The morphology of CuS powders
has been investigated by field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and the images are presented
in Figure 2a–c
for CuS-ST, CuS-TA, and CuS-TU, respectively. Figure 2a shows the image of as-synthesized CuS-ST
powders that has an elongated one-dimensional structure. In contrast
to the one-dimensional structures formed, few bundled flaky structures
are also observed that is composed of numerous elongated ferns. This
suggests that the one-dimensional structure is shaped as a result
of self-assembly and rearrangement of these flaky forms. A closer
view of the elongated structure indicates that the sheets have assembled
as a result of nucleation and growth process to form an intrinsic
anisotropic structure. The average diameter of the one-dimensional
structure has been calculated to be ∼35 nm. The hexagonal CuS
sheets consist of alternating layers of CuS and Cu2S2 as composites held by weak van der Waals forces that the
crystal can effortlessly cleave and obtain the smooth surface.34 The aggregation and arrangements of these sheets
along an oriented direction are governed by the factors such as concentration
of precursors, reaction time, and also the source of sulfur in the
reaction. The chemical reaction occurring in the presence of Na2S2O3 is that S2O32– ions in the solution combines with Cu2+ ions to form [Cu(S2O3)·2(H2O)] and [Cu(S2O3)2]2– complexes in water at room temperature. CuS is formed upon reaction
between Cu/Cu2+ ions produced from the dissociated complex
and S2– ions formed as a result of hydrolysis as
shown in the equations (eqs 1 and 2) below35 1   2  

Figure 2 FESEM images of (a) CuS-ST,
(b) CuS-TA, (c,d) CuS-TU, and (e) graphical
representation of the morphology formation.

The FESEM image of CuS-TA powder, which uses thioacetamide
as a
sulfur source, shows flat random set of particles, as observed in Figure 2b. Hydrothermal synthesis
of sulfide is related to the coordination between the metal ions and
also dissociation of the sulfide precursor. The dissociation of thioacetamide
to sulfide ions (S2–) under hydrothermal condition
governs the process of nucleation, growth, distribution, and aggregation
of the particles. Under acidic condition, thioacetamide dissociates
into H2S via an intermediate product that further dissociates
into HS– and S2–. However, in
the present study, the above phenomenon does not occur because the
solution is not acidic. It can be presumed that the reaction precursor
forms the [Cu(CH3CSNH2)2]NO3 complex that dissociates to corresponding Cu2+ and NO32– ions along with the CH3CSNH2 group. This undergoes hydrolysis under high temperature and
pressure to form H2S and reacts with the produced Cu2+ ions, precipitating CuS. The disordered nucleation/growth
followed by the formation of an improper and randomly oriented morphology
attributes to the low degree of product yield (∼50%) during
the thioacetamide-assisted hydrolysis reaction. The probable chemical
reaction for the precipitation of CuS in the presence of thioacetamide
can be given as follows36 3  

Similar to the complex formation using
thioacetamide, thiourea
also forms a strong complex in the presence of Cu2+ ions
and water, which is evident from the change in color of the reaction
solution from green to pale white, indicative of the formation of
the thiourea–copper(II) complex as shown in the first step
of eq 4.26 However, the precipitation of CuS follows the process similar
to that of CuS formed from the hydrolysis of dissociated thioacetamide
complex, followed by the reaction with Cu2+ ions in the
solution. 4  

The anisotropic growth of the particles in the presence of
thiourea
can be attributed to the self-assembly of sheet-like structures to
well-ordered and oriented hierarchical spherical flower-like architectures
formed as a result of longer hydrothermal duration (Figure 2c). The average size of the
spherical CuS-flower architectures is found to be ∼2 μm.
A few sheet-like structures are also observed, which may be due to
breaking of the flowers to individual sheets during high ultrasonication
for dispersion of the sample. A magnified and high-resolution image
of a single flower architecture has been shown in Figure 2d, which calculates the average
sheet thickness to be ∼100 nm. It can be visualized that the
spherical flower structure and the sheets forming the flower architecture
is very consistent and well-distributed, irrespective of the formation
of any other morphology. Conclusively, all synthesized CuS powders
using different sulfur sources undergo a similar chemical reaction
and morphology formation mechanism. It is the release rate of S2– ions under hydrothermal condition that presides over
the morphological changes in the metal sulfides.9

From the above elucidation, it can be said that immediate
nuclei
formation followed by anisotropic growth due to high release rate
of S2– ions forms sheet-assembled one-dimensional
structures. The concentration of S2– is lower but
prolonged duration under high pressure changes the morphology. On
the basis of the morphology obtained for CuS powders using thioacetamide
and thiourea, it can be said that the release of S2– from thiourea is faster whereas thioacetamide dissociation to S2– is slower. As an outcome, CuS nuclei could not grow
in an oriented manner in thioacetamide as it did in the presence of
a thiourea-based precursor. A graphic representation of the formation
of different morphology CuS microstructures with different sulfur
sources has been shown in Figure 2e.

For a photocatalyst to be a good candidate,
a large surface area
along with hierarchical cavities is required. For enhanced photocatalytic
activity, the photocatalyst should have higher specific surface area
that serves as an important factor because of the more active catalytic
sites being provided for the photochemical reaction. An adsorption–desorption
isotherm (nitrogen) has been constructed from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area measurement and is depicted in Figure 3a–c for CuS-ST, CuS-TA,
and CuS-TU powders, respectively. The isotherms presented in Figure 3a,b can be categorized
as type III, which suggests weak interaction between the adsorbate
and the adsorbent. There is no observation of the adsorption–desorption
hysteresis loop in the isotherm that rules out the mesoporous behavior
of the synthesized CuS-ST and CuS-TA powders. However, the isotherm
indicated a multilayer gas adsorption, and the specific BET surface
areas measured are 5.2 and 6.6 m2/g for CuS-ST and CuS-TA,
respectively. High surface area for CuS-TA in comparison with CuS-ST
could be due to the low particle size in CuS-TA than CuS-ST, as observed
from FESEM images. There is a significant hysteresis loop in Figure 3c that can be categorized
as type IV, which implies the presence of mesopores in the flower
structure. The mesoporosity can be attributed to the space between
the intercrossed sheets forming flower architectures. The BET surface
area of the spherical CuS-flowers (CuS-TU) is measured to be 15.3
m2/g, with the flower having a pore volume of 6.43 ×
10–2 cm3/g and a pore diameter of 5.8
nm. It is the highest measured surface area among the synthesized
photocatalysts, which is due to spherical hierarchical existence of
flowers and open cavities in the structure. Thus, it can be attributed
that the spherical flower structure obtained in CuS-TU should be a
promising photocatalytic candidate for degradation of organic pollutants
in comparison with other photocatalysts.

Figure 4a,b
shows
the typical TEM images of the CuS powders synthesized by thiourea
as CuS-TU exhibited high degradation of 4-CP in the presence of visible
light irradiation. The TEM image of a single spherical flower architecture
is shown in Figure 4a. The average size of the spherical flower is found to be ∼2.3
μm. The observation from the TEM image agrees well with the
morphology determined from the FESEM image. The flower edges show
the stack-layered orientation of many CuS sheets. Figure 4b depicts the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image of the individual sheet
stacked to form the flower architecture. The image shows two well-resolved
2D lattice fringes of 0.33 and 0.19 nm that correlate well with the d-spacing of (100) and (110) lattice planes of the as-synthesized
hexagonal CuS, respectively. The lattice fringe calculation has been
carried out using digital micrograph software. The inset of Figure 4b presents the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, which shows a highly ordered
array of a hexagonal spot, which confirms the formation of hexagonal
CuS. The strong and intense spots in the SAED pattern are also indicative
of the single crystallinity of each CuS sheet. Thus, it can be concluded
that the single crystal CuS sheet forming spherical flower architectures
has crystallographic orientation along the (110) plane as predicted
from the XRD analysis.

pattern)
of CuS-TU.

The ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra
of all synthesized CuS structures have been recorded and shown in Figure 5a. All of the absorption
spectra show broad feature in the wavelength range from 330 to 600
nm, which can be ascribed to the excitonic absorption from the covellite
CuS compound. The UV–vis absorption of CuS-TU and CuS-ST are
near similar with a slight shift in absorption from lower to higher
wavelength as observed for CuS-ST. This visible light shift with a
broad absorption between 400 and 550 nm could be attributed to Cu2S, which does not have any clear absorption edge, but it extends
from the UV to visible region. The mere presence of Cu2S in the CuS system introduces an impurity level band structure that
is responsible for shifting the absorption toward the visible region.37

Figure 5 (a) UV–vis diffuse reflectance of CuS microstructures
(inset
represents the Tauc plot) and (b) PL studies of CuS microstructures.

However, the absorption by CuS-TA
is blue-shifted because of the
quantum confinement effect. The optical energy band gaps (Eg) are determined from their optical spectra
by extrapolating the linear region of the band gap plot of (αhν)2 versus hν,
which is the photon energy, where α is the corresponding absorption, h is the Planck’s constant, and ν is the frequency.31,38 The estimated band gap values of CuS structures synthesized with
sodium thiosulphate, thioacetamide, and thiourea are 1.95, 1.85, and
2.16 eV, respectively. The obtained values are in the range of the
band gap values reported by other researchers.31,39 The results suggest that despite the presence of Cu2S
in CuS-ST, there is no significant difference in the calculated band
gap, and thus, the photoactivity of these catalysts will depend on
other physicochemical factors.

To identify the photoconductivity
and its response, photoluminescence
(PL) of CuS powders is of interest. The PL spectra of CuS-ST, CuS-TA,
and CuS-TU powders are shown in Figure 5b. For excitation wavelength of 350 nm, a broad intense
emission peak at 435 nm is observed along with few weak peaks in the
range between 475 and 550 nm.40 The nature
of the emission spectra and its intensity depends on the inherent
morphology and its subsequent property. Although the variation in
PL intensity could be attributed to the size effect or surface oxygen
vacancy and defects owing to dimensional changes,41 the peak positions remain unaltered in the present case.
Among the three powders synthesized, the intensity of CuS-TA is lower
in comparison with both CuS-ST and CuS-TU that suggests that the high
photocatalytic activity should be observed for CuS-TA, which is supported
by its lower band gap energy calculated from UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The lowest activity should be observed
for CuS-ST as it has the highest PL intensity, which corresponds to
the high recombination rate of the electron and hole pair. The formation
of Cu2S in CuS-ST is not carried out under controlled conditions,
and no optimization has been made with regard to the concentration
of Cu2S in CuS-ST. Therefore, it can be presumed that the
highest PL intensity results from the recombination at the grain boundary
centers of Cu2S particles.42 Thus, the decrease in the photocatalytic activity using CuS-ST can
be anticipated.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of CuS-TU
powder was carried
out to confirm the purity, composition, and valence states of the
products obtained as CuS-TU showed the highest photocatalytic activity
among the three catalysts. The wide spectrum as shown in Figure 6a indicates the presence
of Cu and S along with the presence of other elements such as C and
O. The presence of C and O elements is probably due to the exposure
to atmosphere on the surface of the powder. The high-resolution spectrum
of C 1s (Figure 6b)
shows three distinct peaks due to adventitious carbon species at 284.7,
286.2, and 288.1 eV that corresponds to the C–C and C–O–C/C–OH
formation and O–C=O bonds, respectively. A correction
to the binding energy (BE) has been made using the value of 284.8
eV for the observed C 1s charging. The high-resolution XPS of Cu 2p
as presented in Figure 6c shows two strong peaks at 931.9 and 951.8 eV, which is consistent
with the literature data of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively.43 These peaks can be attributed
to the Cu2+ state in CuS structures. Literature reports
the difference between these states to be 20 eV; however, in our case,
it is 19.9 eV, which is nearly the same in accordance with the reported
value. Two satellite peaks at 942.9 and 963.4 eV have been observed,
which correspond to the paramagnetic chemical state of Cu2+. The high-resolution survey of the S 2p region (Figure 6d) shows the presence of two
peaks at BE values of 161.7 and 162.7 eV, which can be attributed
to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 states, respectively.44 The above data suggest the presence of both
the oxidation states of Cu and S in the CuS system.

2.2 Photochemical
Degradation of 4-CP
The photocatalytic degradation performances
of different CuS samples
were evaluated under visible light irradiation for a typical colorless
nondye organic contaminant, namely, 4-CP. Figure 7a presents the degradation profile for time-resolved
degradation of 4-CP. The degradation profile has been plotted as time
(t in h) versus C/Co, where, Co is the initial
concentration of 4-CP and C is the concentration
of 4-CP at time t. The photolytic degradation of
4-CP in the presence of light without the CuS catalyst shows that
only ∼20% degradation takes place in presence of the visible
light (depicted as photolysis in the figure). Prior to each of the
photocatalytic degradation, adsorption–desorption equilibrium
is achieved, and the concentration of 4-CP after adsorption is considered
as initial absorbance of 4-CP. Among the three different CuS structures,
a high photocatalytic degradation of ∼62% is achieved using
CuS-TU after 5 h. A comparatively lower degradation is observed using
CuS-TA with a degradation of only ∼40%, which is significantly
lower than CuS-TU. On the other hand, Cu2S impurity containing
CuS-ST showed only ∼25% degradation of 4-CP. The lowest degradation
by CuS-ST was also predicted by the PL studies owing to the probable
recombination taking place at the grain boundaries of Cu2S particles in excess.45

Figure 7 Photocatalysis of 4-CP
(a) degradation profile (inset presents
the kinetic profile); (b) plot of kinetic rate constants of different
CuS microstructures; and (c) total organic carbon (TOC) profile vs
time for the CuS-TU photocatalyst. (Parameter constants: catalyst
loading—50 mg, initial concentration of 4-CP—100 ppm,
temperature—25 ± 2 °C, and visible light intensity—49 700
lux).

Upon comparing the degradation
efficiencies, it can be said that
the high surface area, crystal structure, and also morphology of the
CuS structure play an important role in the degradation of 4-CP. Thus,
it can be noted that the open flower-like architectures of CuS-TU
provided more active catalytic sites than CuS-TA. This increase in
activity can also be attributed to the high energy surfaces that have
large density of low-coordinated atoms situated on steps and kinks
with high reactivity. These favor the fast ionic transfer between
the surface and the interior. As known from the XRD and HRTEM data,
the crystallographic growth takes place along the (110) plane. The
(110) plane is known to have high surface energy that provides the
active sites for the photochemical reaction. However, this plane is
supposed to be more exposed in spherical CuS-flowers, facilitating
high reactivity between active species and adsorbed molecules on the
surface.

The degradation data are fitted by a pseudo first-order
kinetic
equation and represented as ln C/Co versus time (inset of Figure 7a), which demonstrates that the photocatalytic
activities follow the kinetics well. Figure 7b presents the kinetic rate constant plots
of different CuS structures. The CuS-TU showed the highest rate constant
of 0.18 h–1, which is about ∼1.5 and ∼2
times that of the kinetic rate constants of CuS-TA (0.12 h–1) and CuS-ST (0.10 h–1), respectively. Because
CuS-TU catalyst showed better activity than other existing catalysts,
all further experiments were carried out with CuS-TU as the catalyst.
Furthermore, TOC was determined to understand the mineralization of
4-CP under visible light using CuS-TU photocatalyst. Because 4-CP
is a colorless compound, TOC of the solution obtained at regular photochemical
intervals was evaluated as shown in Figure 7c. It can be clearly observed from the figure
that the TOC has decreased near to 40% after visible light irradiation
for 5 h using CuS-TU catalyst. Thus, the photochemical process is
not just mere degradation of 4-CP into organic carbon byproducts but
also mineralization that takes place via conversion into carbon dioxide
that escapes the liquid. In addition, parametric studies such as catalyst
loading and initial concentration of contaminants have been carried
out for the reactions with CuS-TU catalyst.

To determine the
optimal catalyst amount, various dosages of CuS-TU
catalyst (25, 50, and 100 mg) were mixed with 4-CP having a constant
initial concentration (100 ppm). Figure 8a presents the degradation profile of 4-CP
as an effect of catalyst loading. From the figure, it can be observed
that when the catalyst is reduced to half (25 mg) and doubled (100
mg) from 50 mg in 50 mL of 100 ppm 4-CP solution, the degradation
of 4-CP also reduces significantly to ∼35 and ∼50%,
respectively. Increasing the catalyst loading from 25 to 50 mg increases
the photocatalytic degradation, but doubling the catalyst concentration
to 100 mg from 50 mg decreases the catalytic activity by ∼12%.
This decrement could be attributed to the solution turbidity that
does not allow the light to fall on particles and also segregation
of particles become difficult in the solution.4,46 The
inset of Figure 8a
demonstrates the kinetic profile of the reaction. The figure shows
that the reaction follows the pseudo first-order kinetics well. The
kinetic rate constants are 0.09, 0.18, and 0.15 h–1 for 25, 50, and 100 mg catalyst loading, respectively. The above
data depict that the rate is almost halved when the catalyst loading
is half of the optimal condition, that is, 50 mg loading, whereas
when the loading is doubled the rate is reduced to 1.2 times. This
study suggests that with catalyst loading of 50 mg, the photodegradation
is highest; therefore, 50 mg loading is used for further parametric
experiments.

Figure 8 Photocatalysis of 4-CP as an effect of (a) catalyst loading
(inset
presents the kinetic profile); (b) initial 4-CP concentration; (c)
plot of kinetic rate constants vs initial 4-CP concentration; and
(d) effect of H2O2 oxidizer (inset represents
the kinetic rate constants) (parameter constants: chosen catalyst—CuS-TU,
initial concentration of 4-CP—100 ppm, temp.—25 ±
2 °C, and visible light intensity—49 700 lux).

The effect of varying the initial
concentration of 4-CP on its
photodegradation using CuS-TU catalyst has been shown in Figure 8b. A complete degradation
is observed with lowest concentration of 4-CP, that is, 10 ppm. However,
the 4-CP concentration of 25, 50, and 100 ppm is photocatalytically
reduced to 9.7 ppm (∼60% degradation), 20.7 ppm (∼59%
degradation), and 38 ppm (∼62% degradation) concentrations,
respectively. A better outlook to the reaction processes could be
understood from the kinetic rate constants of the reactions, which
has been calculated using the first-order kinetic equation. Figure 8c shows the plot
of calculated kinetic rate constants at different initial concentrations
of 4-CP. The first-order rate constant is almost constant irrespective
of the initial concentration of 10 ppm (0.21 h–1), 25 ppm (0.197 h–1), 50 ppm (0.189 h–1), and 100 ppm (0.182 h–1). For higher concentration
of 4-CP, that is, 100 ppm, experiments have been carried out in the
presence of hydrogen peroxide as the concentration of oxidant increases
the rate of degradation significantly.

Figure 8d compares
the photocatalytic degradation of 100 ppm of 4-CP with the influence
of visible light in three different conditions: (i) in the presence
of H2O2 (without catalyst, designated as H2O2); (ii) in the presence of catalyst (without
H2O2, designated as control); and (iii) in the
presence of both H2O2 and catalyst (designated
as H2O2 + control). The concentration of hydrogen
peroxide taken is 5 mM, which is kept constant in both the photochemical
reactions except in control experiments. The degradation of 4-CP in
the presence of H2O2 solution under irradiation
is via photolysis of H2O2, that is, through
hemolytic cleavage of H2O2 producing HO• radicals, which contributes to the photochemical reaction
(eq 5). The degradation
observed in the presence of H2O2 is nearly 30%,
which is 10% higher than the photolysis (20%). This phenomenon indicates
that the production of hydroxyl radicals for the degradation of 4-CP
in the presence of H2O2 is very slow. However,
in comparison with control experiment that exhibits 62% degradation,
the degradation of 4-CP is enhanced by ∼21% in the presence
of H2O2 with control (∼83% degradation).
The inset of Figure 8d shows the rate constants of the photochemical reactions, which
evidently indicate that the rate of the reaction increases significantly
in the presence of an oxidizer which is 0.36 h–1. There is a twofold increase in the rate when compared to control
(0.18 h–1). Although the rate is increased, complete
degradation of 4-CP is still not achieved with 5 mM H2O2 that advocates may be a higher concentration of the oxidizer
or prolonged reaction time that can oxidize the pollutant completely.
Apart from the photolytic production of HO• radicals
that contribute to the photochemical reaction, Cu2+ in
CuS-TU can also react with the oxidizer to produce hydroxyl radicals
and carry out the reaction as given in eqs 6 and 7.

Additionally,
H2O2 also accepts the photogenerated
electron for CuS that inhibits the electron–hole pair recombination
and also facilitates additional HO• radicals as
shown in eq 8. Thus,
the probable involved chemical reactions in the presence of the oxidizer
are given as follows47 5   6   7   8  

In a photochemical
reaction, the photoinduced electrons and holes
are generated as a result of excitation of electrons from the valence
band (VB) to the conduction band (CB) upon visible light illumination.
The level of the VB and the CB of CuS has been calculated using the
given relation48 9   10  In eqs 9 and 10, EVB is
the VB potential edge, X is the electronegativity
of the semiconductor material, Ee is the
free electron energy on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), Eg is the energy band gap of the prepared CuS-TU
catalyst, and ECB is the CB potential
edge. The electronegativity of the CuS material can be obtained from
the arithmetic mean of the electron affinity and the first ionization
energy of the constituent atoms, as reported in literature to be 5.29
eV. The calculated CB and VB potentials of CuS-TU catalyst are −0.29
and 1.87 eV versus normal hydrogen electrode, respectively. A corresponding
band diagram of CuS-TU has been plotted and shown in Figure 9a, which indicates that the
photogenerated electron and hole can stimulate both the adsorbed oxygen
and water molecules on the catalyst surface to produce reactive oxygen
species such as O2–• (superoxide
anion) and •OH (hydroxyl) radicals, respectively. These reactive
oxygen species can initialize the catalytic reactions by typical reaction
pathways on the catalyst surface to degrade the organic molecules.6,49

To better understand the possible
mechanism for the degradation
of 4-CP via these reactive species, experiments have been carried
out in the presence of the scavengers to determine the contribution
of species in the photochemical reaction without the presence of the
oxidizer H2O2. The effect of different scavenging
additives such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (h+ scavenger,
EDTA), benzoquinone (•O2– scavenger,
BQN), and tert-butylalcohol (•OH scavenger, t-BuOH) on the photochemical reaction is studied with 1
mM of the scavenging agent in the control solution. Figure 9b presents the concentration
of 4-CP and rate constants of the photochemical reaction carried out
in presence of the scavengers. A careful observation reveals that
a significant decrease in reaction rate is found in the presence of
the hydroxyl radical scavenger, that is, t-BuOH (∼10
× 10–2 h–1) in comparison
with the reaction rate of the control experiment (∼21 ×
10–2 h–1), and the concentration
after the reaction was near to 72 ppm. However, there is not much
difference between the rates of reaction of t-BuOH
(∼10 × 10–2 h–1) and
EDTA (∼13 × 10–2 h–1) but a significant difference in concentration (∼16 ppm)
after the reaction signifies the efficient scavenging property of t-BuOH than EDTA, which showed a moderate decrease in the
efficiency of catalytic degradation. This suggests that the photogenerated
hole in the reaction also have partial contribution in degradation,
which is governed by hydroxyl radicals produced as a result of chain
reactions with holes. The high reaction rate of BQN (∼15 ×
10–2 h–1) could be attributed
to the disproportionation of the superoxide radical to form hydroxyl
radicals that contributes to the redox reaction degrading 4-CP. The
rate of BQN is 1.45 times greater than the rate of reaction of t-BuOH. The scavenging experiments concluded that the hydroxyl
radicals are the prime reactive oxygen species that are involved in
the photodegradation of 4-CP. Literature reports that the degradation
pathways for 4-CP through hydroxyl radicals are via production of
hydroquinone and hydroxyhydroquinone as reaction intermediates.50,51 Considering the materials perspective, based on the above observations,
a photocatalytic mechanism has been deduced for the degradation of
4-CP using CuS-TU catalyst in the absence of the oxidizer. The catalytic
degradation using CuS-TU catalyst is given by the following equations19 11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18  

For practical application of the heterogeneous
catalyst, recyclability
and stability of the catalyst is an important factor. Thus, recyclability
of the CuS-TU catalyst has been carried out to understand the reactivity
of the samples with consecutive reuse, till 10 cycles (Figure 9c). After each of the photochemical
experiments, the catalyst was separated from the 4-CP solution via
centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol, followed by drying
at 60 °C for 12 h in a hot air oven. The dried catalyst was then
reused for the second experiment. However, it can be noticed that
with each consecutive recycle the concentration of 4-CP increases,
which suggests that first run has the highest degradation efficiency
that decreases with increasing cycles. This decrement could be attributed
to the loss of catalyst during the recycling process, which reduces
the active sites, thereby rendering less activity compared with the
pristine powder. There is a difference of only 5% in concentration
between the 1st and the 10th run, which indicates that the catalyst
is stable and recyclable. To further understand the stability of the
catalyst, the physicochemical characteristics such as phase and surface
area of the catalyst after the reaction were studied. Figure 9d represents the XRD pattern
of the CuS-TU catalyst before and after the reaction (CuS-TU catalyst
obtained after the 10th cycle). There is no significant difference
in the XRD pattern of CuS-TU after the reaction as they match well
with the pristine synthesized CuS-TU powder. However, a negligible
difference in the surface area of the powder is observed after the
reaction. The surface area of CuS-TU catalyst after 10 consecutive
cycles exhibited a surface area of ∼14 m2/g, which
is lower than the surface area of the pristine powder. Thus, it can
be said that with the lowering of the surface area, the active surface
site also reduces, and therefore, the photocatalytic activity drops
in comparison.

In the recent past, CuS ball flowers were synthesized
hydrothermally
using copper chloride and thiourea in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
as a surfactant. Ball-flower-shaped CuS was tested for photocatalytic
degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under UV light irradiation, and complete
degradation was achieved in 60 min.11 Another
research by Li et al. illustrated a solvothermal route to prepare
hierarchical CuS nanostructures using thiourea, and 90% degradation
of methylene blue (20 ppm) under visible light was achieved with the
assistance of the oxidizer (H2O2).52 The latter reported that the degradation value
is similar to the value reported in the present work, but the difference
remains in the type of pollutant. It is not appropriate to compare
the catalytic results unless the conditions of experiments that are
carried out are similar. However, a comparative report consisting
of work on different organic pollutant degradation using CuS structures
with specific parameters (CuS synthesis route, chemicals used, morphology,
surface area, pollutants, concentration, illumination source, degradation
in time, and others) has been tabulated (Table 1). As can be observed from the tabulated
data, in most of the cases, pollutant concentration is very low and
UV light/sunlight has been used, which completely degrades the organic
pollutant, mainly dyes. The presence of sunlight degrades the dye
completely but as UV light is present in sunlight, it is difficult
to differentiate the effect of visible light and UV light. Therefore,
the visible light response of CuS structures is necessary and has
been accomplished in this study.

3 Conclusions
Hierarchical CuS microstructures were successfully
synthesized
by the hydrothermal route using a common base precursor and different
sulfur sources at 150 °C for 24 h. The physicochemical analysis
of the CuS powders suggested the formation of pure hexagonal phase
with variant morphologies. The study reveals that the release rate
of S2– ions from the complex plays a crucial role
governing the nucleation and growth process under elevated temperature
to form different hierarchical structures. The synthesized CuS photocatalysts
were tested for their photocatalytic assessment toward 4-CP under
visible light. The results showed that thiourea-assisted flower-like
CuS architectures exhibited the highest degradation efficiency and
depended on the surface area of the catalyst as well. The hydroxyl
radical species were observed to have the crucial contribution to
the degradation of 4-CP, and the catalyst showed an efficient recyclability
and reusability.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of CuS Photocatalyst
The CuS photocatalyst
was prepared by a rapid and one-step hydrothermal
method. In a typical synthesis, 40 mL of aqueous solution of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was prepared by dissolving
1 mmol of the compound. To the above solution, 2.5 mmol Na2S2O3 was added under stirring to ensure complete
dissolution of reactants. The prepared solution was taken as the precursor
for the hydrothermal reaction. The precursor solution was then transferred
to a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave followed by tight
sealing of the autoclave. The reaction vessel was kept inside of the
preheated furnace at 150 °C for 24 h duration. After the stipulated
duration, the furnace was switched off and the reaction vessel was
allowed to cool down naturally to the room temperature. The black
precipitated solution was thoroughly washed with distilled water and
absolute ethanol. The precipitate obtained after washing was dried
in a crystallization dish at 70 °C for 5 h. A similar process
was repeated using C2H5NS and CH4N2S as other sulfur sources. Finally, three different
powders synthesized using sodium thiosulphate, thioacetamide, and
thiourea were named CuS-ST, CuS-TA, and CuS-TU, respectively, in which
the state of sulfur in all three sources were the same.

4.2 Catalyst Characterizations
The crystal
phases of the prepared photocatalysts were recorded by powder XRD
measurements on a Rigaku diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Specific surface area (BET) of
the photocatalysts were obtained from nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms (BELSORP). Prior to the surface area and isotherm determination,
regeneration of photocatalyst at 150 °C for 90 min was carried
to remove the moisture. Raman measurements of all photocatalysts were
carried out in backscattering geometry with a triple-grating spectrometer
equipped with a cooled charge-coupled device detector. The 532 nm
line of an Ar+/Kr+ mixed-gas laser was used
for excitation. The study of the morphology of the photocatalysts
was observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ULTRA 55-FESEM,
Carl Zeiss. The sample preparation for SEM was carried through dispersion
of catalyst in absolute ethanol and ultrasonication of dispersion
for 30 min. Silicon wafers were used as the dispersion substrate,
and the dispersion was drop-casted onto it followed by drying at 90
°C in hot air oven. The prepared SEM samples were desiccated
under vacuum for 24 h and sputtered with gold using Quorum sputtering.
High-resolution study of the optimized photocatalyst was carried out
using a transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM-2100 system). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) sample preparation is similar to that of
the FESEM except for the dispersing solvent, which was isopropanol
and the drop-casting substrate, which was Cu-grid in the TEM measurement.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of all photocatalysts were
carried in a PerkinElmer, Lambda 35 UV vis spectrophotometer in the
wavelength window of 200 to 700 nm using BaSO4 as a reference.
PL measurements of the photocatalysts were carried using a Hitachi
F-4500 spectrofluorimeter in the wavelength range from 200 to 600
nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement of the
optimized catalyst was performed on a Axis Ultra X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer. The BE was referenced to C 1s line at 284.8 eV from
the adventitious carbon.

4.3 Photochemical Experiments
The photocatalytic
performance of the synthesized CuS photocatalysts was evaluated by
the degradation of 4-CP under visible light irradiation. The visible
light experiments were carried by using a 400 W metal halide lamp
obtained from Philips, India, with light intensity ∼49 700
lux. The metal halide lamp was jacketed with a quartz tube, and the
tube was in continuous supply of water using a chiller (maintained
at 20 °C) to ensure reaction under room temperature. The reaction
solution to undergo catalytic reaction was placed in a quartz beaker.
Prior to the photochemical reaction, a standard stock solution of
100 ppm 4-CP was prepared, which was maintained throughout the photocatalytic
reaction. For photochemical reaction using different CuS catalysts,
the catalyst concentration was kept constant at 1 g/L. Before each
of the photochemical experiments, adsorption–desorption equilibrium
was attained by keeping the mixed 4-CP-catalyst suspension in dark
(in the absence of light). During the catalytic experiments, 2 mL
of suspension was taken out at certain time intervals and centrifuged
(3000 rpm for 30 min) to separate the catalyst and supernatant. The
supernatant was further filtered through doubly stacked 0.22 membrane
filters to assure the complete removal of particles, and samples were
analyzed using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique.
The TOC of the filtered solution obtained after different time intervals
of the photochemical reaction using CuS-TU catalyst was also examined
with the Shimadzu, TOC VCSN analyzer.

4.4 Sample Analysis
The extent of degradation
of 4-CP was determined using the HPLC technique. The HPLC instrument
consisted of an isocratic pump (Waters 515 HPLC pump), a Rheodyne
injector, C-18 Column, a UV detector (Waters 2487), and a data acquisition
system. The mobile phase consisted of 50% water and 50% acetonitrile
in volume with 0.1% formic acid. The mobile phase was pumped at the
rate of 0.4 mL/min. The filtered samples were injected through the
Rheodyne valve with a sample loop of 20 μL, and the UV absorbance
at 283 nm was monitored by a UV detector and stored in the digital
mode. The chromatograph obtained was converted to concentration units
using the calibration carried with pure standard solution of compounds.
Additionally, individual experiments in the presence of the oxidizer
and trapping agents were also carried to understand the involvement
of reactive species. The oxidizer (5 mM) and 1 mM trapping agents
were added to the optimized photochemical conditions.
