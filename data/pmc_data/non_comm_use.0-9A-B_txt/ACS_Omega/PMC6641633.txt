The role of electrostatic
interactions in the viral capsid assembly
process was studied by comparing the assembly process of a truncated
hepatitis B virus capsid protein Cp149 with its mutant protein D2N/D4N,
which has the same conformational structure but four fewer charges
per dimer. The capsid protein self-assembly was investigated under
a wide range of protein surface charge densities by changing the protein
concentration, buffer pH, and solution ionic strength. Lowering the
protein charge density favored the capsid formation. However, lowering
charge beyond a certain point resulted in capsid aggregation and precipitation.
Interestingly, both the wild-type and D2N/D4N mutant displayed identical
assembly profiles when their charge densities matched each other.
These results indicated that the charge density was optimized by nature
to ensure an efficient and effective capsid proliferation under the
physiological pH and ionic strength.

1 Introduction
Viral
capsids are symmetric protein shells made up of copies of
one or a few different types of capsid proteins (Cps). Besides their
basic function of protecting the viral genome enclosed inside, they
also play a role in many steps of the infection cycle, including genome
replication, assembly of progeny viruses and disassembly for genome
release.1−3 To be viable, virus capsids exhibit efficient assembly
with high fidelity, sufficient stability against inactivation, and
at the same time, certain fragility to release genetic content upon
infection.4−6 Noncovalent interactions between capsid proteins
play a key role in this process. Studying the nature of noncovalent
interactions between these biomacromolecules can help to understand
and even predict the behavior of capsids, thus further promoting the
development of new antiviral strategies.7−13

In this study, hepatitis B virus (HBV) was chosen as the model
to explore how the electrostatic interactions between protein–protein
and protein–counterion could affect the capsid assembly. HBV
is a liver tissue specific enveloped DNA virus, which is also a causative
factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis.
It has been used as a common model system for understanding the viral
capsid assembly and virus–host interactions. The HBV core protein
has a full length of 183 amino acids with its C-terminal tail (residues
150–183) responsible for nucleic acid binding. When the last
34 residues are truncated, the remaining polypeptide with 149 residues
(Cp149) is still able to assemble into capsids when different salts
are introduced.14−17 The assemblies exhibit similar morphology and antigenic properties
as the native capsids isolated from cell cultures and still present
the coexistence of T = 3 and T =
4 (predominant) structures.15 Thus, Cp–Cp
interactions alone are capable of driving capsid formation, and the
negatively charged Cp149 is a good candidate to investigate the role
of electrostatic interactions during capsid formation. Dimer Cp1492 is the basic building unit of the capsids. In vitro capsid
assembly of HBV Cp1492 had been studied under different
pHs, protein concentrations, and salt concentrations.18−20 Extensive experiments, including Cp mutations, have been conducted
to emphasize the importance of the hydrophobic interaction as a driving
force for assembly.21,22 However, the research on the
role of electrostatic interactions in empty capsid assembly was limited
to theoretical calculations.23,24 Unlike many noncovalent
interactions that become effective only at a short distance, electrostatic
interactions are unique long-range forces. As a result, they play
pivotal roles in many important biological processes. It is important
to experimentally explore their contribution to the overall capsid
formation and capsid stability, so as to generate a comprehensive
understanding of the major interactions in capsid assembly and further
apply this knowledge to comprehend the capsid behavior in general.

Toward this goal, two aspartic acids (D) were replaced with neutral
asparagines (N) to create a mutant Cp149 dimer D2N/D4N to remove two
negative charges from each wild-type (WT) protein monomer (Figure 1a,b). The mutation
sites were selected at the very beginning of N-terminus to avoid the
potential effect on dimer association or protein folding. Thus, the
observed difference in the assembly behavior could be attributed to
macroion–counterion interactions. The assembly kinetics and
thermodynamics of WT and D2N/D4N were investigated under different
conditions. It was found that Cp149 dimers were highly soluble and
remained stable in solution because of their surface charges. The
incorporation of additional counterions screened the surface charges
and triggered dimer association into capsids. A lower protein surface
charge density favored capsid assembly, which explained the faster
and more stable formation of capsids at lower pH values. It was also
discovered that the charge density of a protein was more important
when the salt concentration in the buffer was low. Furthermore, it
appeared that the charge number of the WT capsid protein enabled an
efficient and effective capsid proliferation, suggesting that the
charge number has been evolutionarily optimized.

created by replacing the 2nd and 4th Asp with neutral Asn (shown as
sticks) to reduce the overall charge density on a dimer. (c) Molecular

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Monitoring and Characterization of WT Capsid
Formation
Each WT Cp149 dimer carries about 14 negative charges
at pH 7.5 (Table 1 and Supporting Information for calculation and measurement
details). Potassium ions (K+) were chosen as the counterions
to study the capsid formation due to their abundance in human cells
where HBV replication takes place. Prior to the addition of KCl salt,
Cp149 proteins remained as homodimers in solution, as shown by an
average hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 3.5
nm from the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements (Figure 2a). Static light
scattering (SLS) was used to monitor the assembly process. As shown
in Figure 2c, once
0.2 M KCl was added to the WT protein solution (e.g., 2.0 mg mL–1), the scattered light intensity immediately started
to rapidly increase for the first 10 min, then the growth became slower.
Capsid assembly reached equilibrium within 24 h. Because the scattered
light intensity I ∝ C × MW,26 with C and MW being the mass concentration
and the molecular weight of the solutes, respectively, small dimer
proteins scatter light much less than large capsids (120 times of
the dimer’s mass). Therefore, the increase of the scattered
intensity with time reflects the kinetics of capsid formation. The
intensity stopped growing when dimers and capsids reached equilibrium.
Higher protein concentration and salt concentration both accelerated
the assembly rate and increased the final capsid concentration, as
shown by a steeper slope of the intensity increment curve and a higher
final intensity (Figures 2c–e and 4b). During the capsid
assembly, the Rh peak of dimers gradually
reduced, whereas a new capsid peak appeared (Figure 2a). Because Cp149 dimers can form T = 3 (R = 16 nm) and T = 4 capsids (R = 18 nm) in solution, the measured Rh of 18.3 ± 0.5 nm is consistent with the
average size of mixed capsids, with T = 4 being the
dominant species.27T =
3 and T = 4 capsids could not be distinguished through
the DLS technique, but the existence of both was verified using transmission
electron microscope (TEM) imaging of negatively stained samples (Figure 3a).

2.2 Lower Protein Charge Density
Favors Capsid
Assembly
Scattered light intensity monitored by SLS revealed
that D2N/D4N dimers assembled much faster and reached a higher final
scattering intensity than WT Cp149 dimers (Figure 2c,d). A capsid radius of Rh = 17.5 ± 0.4 nm, similar to that of WT, was obtained
from the DLS studies (Figure 2b). The same capsid morphology and a combination of T = 3 and T = 4 structures were verified
on TEM images (Figure 3b). Therefore, the higher scattering intensity indicated that more
capsids were formed from D2N/D4N dimers under the same condition.
This difference in the capsid formation was mainly due to different
dimer charge densities. The impact from mutation was excluded because
the overall structures of WT and D2N/D4N mutants were the same, demonstrated
by their overlapped circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectra
in Figure S1D,E, and the mutated sites
were not involved in dimer–dimer association (Figure S1). The lower charge density of D2N/D4N dimers resulted
in weaker electrostatic repulsion between dimers, which promoted the
capsid formation and more capsids were formed under the same condition.
Furthermore, CD and fluorescence spectra indicated that the addition
of KCl did not lead to detectable secondary or tertiary structural
change (Figure S2), confirming that the
association of monovalent salts with protein was playing a charge
screening role without changing the protein conformation.

HBV
Cp149 dimers are highly soluble and can be regarded as macroions in
aqueous solution, although they have hydrophobic patches on the surface.
When dimers self-assemble into capsids, 75% of the buried contact
surface is hydrophobic, contributed from more than 50% of the hydrophobic
residues in the contact region (Figure 1). The hydrophobic contact area is ∼5.5–7.6
nm2 and is not affected by the mutation.19 Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction should be the same
for both the WT and D2N/D4N. This short-range attraction was balanced
by long-range electrostatic repulsion, which regulated the Cp1492 assembly. In the WT protein sequence, there are 17 basic
residues and 14 acidic ones, resulting in an isoelectric point at
pH 5.05. At pH 7.5, the effective surface charge density of the WT
dimer was −0.40 charges nm–2 (dimer surface
area is ∼36.3 nm2), whereas that of D2N/D4N was
lowered to −0.29 charges nm–2. The presence
of additional K+ ions further screened the negative charges
and lowered the effective charge density. The reduced protein–protein
repulsion made the hydrophobic attraction more dominant and the capsid
formation more favored.

2.3 Capsid Formation is Sensitive
to Surface Charge
Density at Certain Salt Concentrations
The ionic strength
in solution is critical to the solution behavior of proteins. When
the salt concentration was too low, the repulsive protein–protein
interactions dominated over the hydrophobic attraction among them;
thus, capsids were barely formed. Increasing K+ concentration
to 0.2 M enabled rapid association of D2N/D4N dimers, especially at
higher protein concentrations (Figure 2c). After reaching equilibrium, the 1.0 mg mL–1 D2N/D4N−0.2 M K+ solution had 44% of dimer proteins
assembled into capsids, as determined by the elution peak area ratio
of capsids over the total contribution from proteins, obtained from
size exclusion chromatography (SEC). At the same salt concentration,
much fewer capsids were formed in WT protein solutions due to a higher
charge density (Figure 4a). When K+ was increased to 0.5
M, the difference between WT and D2N/D4N capsid formation still existed
but became smaller (Figure 2d). Capsid formation was further diminished when more K+ was added (Figure 2e). When 0.7 M K+ was added, the portions of Cp1492 (1.0 mg mL–1) assembled into capsids at
equilibrium are 87% (WT) and 89% (D2N/D4N) (Figure 4a). In terms of association energy per contact,19 the ΔGcontact was calculated as −3.01 and −3.18 kcal mol–1 for WT and D2N/D4N at the low salt concentration (0.2 M KCl), respectively.
Under the high salt condition (0.7 M KCl), however, the ΔGcontact of WT and D2N/D4N assembly became much
closer by 53%, being −3.56 and −3.65 kcal mol–1, respectively (calculation details in the Supporting Information). These results indicated that excessive amount
of counterions led to a strong protein–counterion binding that
could diminish the charge density difference between proteins, resulting
in a similar assembly behavior kinetically and thermodynamically.
In contrast, at lower salt concentration, e.g., 0.2 M K+, which is close to the ionic strength in the cell, the kinetics
and thermodynamics of the capsid formation were strongly affected
by the protein charge density.

scattered intensity increment of WT and D2N/D4N capsid assemblies

A series of experiments
with varying protein concentrations were
conducted to further explore the effective salt range where protein
charge played roles. As shown in Figure 4b, KCl was titrated into protein solutions
at various concentrations with an increment of 0.1 M per 24 h to a
final concentration of 1.0 M. On-line scattered intensities in SLS
were recorded to monitor capsid formation. Obviously, higher protein
concentrations favored the capsid formation, represented by the higher
scattered intensity and a lower critical salt concentration (CSC).
The CSC of D2N/D4N solution increased from <0.1 to 0.6 M of K+ when protein concentration dropped from 120 to 20 μM.
The CSC of D2N/D4N was always slightly lower than that of WT. Interestingly,
proteins with different charge densities had their own assembly−sensitive
counterion concentration regions, shifting to higher [K+] when lowering [Cp1492] (Figure 4b). Above this [K+] region is
where the final scattered intensities for D2N/D4N and WT reached the
same plateau, indicating that most dimers had formed into capsids.
The effect of charge difference on capsid formation was screened by
excess counterions. Within this [K+] region, D2N/D4N formed
more capsids than WT. The screening effect−regulated assembly
was very sensitive to protein charge and the variation of ionic strength,
and the absence of four negative charges made a significant difference
in capsid assembly. Below this [K+] range, few capsids
formed.

Although only K+ was used for capsid assembly
in this
work, various salts and salts of different valances have been explored
by Zlotnick and other groups16,17 As previously reported,
Na+ and K+ induced Cp1492 assembly
with similar critical concentrations, whereas divalent ions, such
as Mg2+ and Ca2+, significantly promoted the
assembly with a 4 times lower critical concentration. Interestingly,
the effect of counterions on capsid protein assembly is very similar
to inorganic macroions represented by polyoxometalate (POM)−based
inorganic clusters. Both capsid
proteins and inorganic clusters are charged macromolecules with size
ranging from 1 to 10 nm in diameter. They can no longer be treated
as point charges because of their large sizes. To screen the intermolecular
repulsion, metal ions of higher valences and lower hydrated radii
associate more strongly with macroions, thus lowering CSC for supramolecular
assembly.28 Therefore, multivalent ions
play a more significant role in stabilizing capsids. To some virions,
like southern bean mosaic virus, the deprivation of divalent ions
would cause capsid dissociation.29−31

2.4 pH Effect
on the Capsid Formation
The overall net charge of the HBV
Cp149 dimer is pH dependent and
can be estimated using Henderson–Hasselbalch equation. Charge
numbers for both WT and D2N/D4N dimers within pH 6.6–9.6 were
calculated (Table 1) using protein calculator 3.4 (http://protcalc.sourceforge.net). The effective charges on dimers can also be obtained through mobility
measurement. The mobilities of WT dimer at pH 7.5 (Tris buffer), pH
8.5 (Tris buffer), and pH 9.6 (NaHCO3 buffer) were −1.140,
−1.498, and −1.575 μm cm s–1 V–1, respectively. The effective charges were
calculated to be −14.5, −17.6, and −28.8, which
were close to theoretical results (Table S1, measurement and calculation details in the Supporting Information). As investigated in previous studies,3,18 the capsid formation became more difficult at a higher pH (higher
protein charge density) (Figure 5a). Within a wide range of protein charge densities
adjusted by pH, both proteins assembled into capsids of the same sizes
(Figure 5b), which
means that the fidelity of capsid morphology was maintained by geometrical
restriction through the hydrophobic contact.

studies of Cp1492 assembly
with various protein charges. (a) Effect of pH (charge) on assembly
kinetics of WT and D2N/D4N proteins (Tris buffer covers pH 7.5–8.5;
NaHCO3 buffer used at pH 9.6). The assembly rate slowed
down with an increasing pH. The assembly of the mutant was always
faster than the WT when compared at the same pH; (b) CONTIN results
from DLS studies showed the same Rh distribution
of WT and mutant capsids over a wide range of pH; (c) proteins carrying
the same charge numbers (represented by the same color) showed the
similar assembly kinetics pathways. The assemblies in this plot were
all prepared in Tris buffer; (d) the free energy per contact of the
charge−matched WT and D2N/D4N capsids formation. The above
assemblies were all performed in 1 mg mL–1 protein
with 0.5 M buffered K+. The error bar represents the standard
deviation from three measurements.

A low protein charge density would enhance capsid formation,
but
it also decreased the solubility and even functionality of the capsids
in solution. For example, when the overall charge of the mutant dimer
was lowered to −8.4 (in HEPES buffer at pH 7; dimer surface
charge density was −0.23 charge nm–2), the
addition of 0.5 M KCl induced a quick capsid formation followed by
the extensive capsid aggregation (Figure S5), due to their limited solubility. Thus, capsids assembled from
subunits of very low charges tended to easily aggregate or precipitate.

2.5 Equivalent Charge Density Led to Identical
Capsid Assembly Process for WT and D2N/D4N
Under the same
buffer condition and pH, D2N/D4N assembly was always more kinetically
favored than WT due to its fewer charges (Figure 5a). An interesting question is if WT and
mutant would behave the same when carrying the same number of charges.
This can be answered by studying the capsid formation processes of
WT and mutant at different pHs to match their charge densities. Protein
concentration was maintained at 1.0 mg mL–1, and
the protein structural stability under various pHs was confirmed in Figure S6. Assemblies of the WT and mutant were
compared under conditions when they carry the same number of charges
(Table 1). When 0.5
M buffered K+ was added into charge−matched solutions,
as shown in Figure 5c, the kinetics of WT and mutant capsid formation followed a similar
intensity growth path. This was also a strong indication that the
different assembly behaviors between two proteins reported above were
due to their charge difference.

In addition, a gap could be
observed when the capsid formation tendency was plotted as a function
of protein charge number. Using the intensity increment during the
first hour as a measurement of assembly rate (Figures 5c and S3), the
capsid assembly dramatically slowed down when WT Cp149 dimer bearing
charges over −14.4, which is exactly the charge number it carries
at physiological pH. This result suggested that the amino acid sequence
was naturally designed to form assembly-optimized dimer: the number
of basic and acidic amino acid residues resulted in a net charge of
−14.4, which strikes a fine balance optimized for capsid formation
without slowing down the proliferation speed or decreasing the capsid
solubility.

The above samples (dimer charge numbers from −18.8
to −10.4)
were given enough time to reach equilibrium and then tested by SEC
to calculate both the capsid percentage and free energy per contact
of the reactions as a function of charge numbers (Figures 5d and S4, and free energy calculation in the Supporting Information). When the charge density of capsid
protein was lowered from −0.52 to −0.29 charge nm–2, both WT−0.5 M K+ and mutant−0.5
M K+ systems displayed a capsid percentage increased from
73 to 89%. The corresponding free energy ΔGcontact varied from −3.32 to −3.64 kcal
mol–1. Different capsid proteins reached the same
thermodynamic equilibrium when they had the same charge density. The
“assembly gap” in the first hour was a kinetic regulation
step, which disappeared when the assembly process reached equilibrium.

2.6 Comparisons between the Capsid and Inorganic
Blackberry Structure Formation
The spherical viral capsid
structures share many similarities with the previously studied inorganic
charged polyoxometalate (POM) macromolecules, which will self-assemble
into hollow, spherical, single-layered, vesicular-like blackberry-type
structure in solution.32 Assembled large
icosahedral capsids and blackberry structures are still soluble and
form homogeneous “real solutions”, which distinguish
them from colloidal particles.33 By changing
macroion charge density, the assembly processes of both inorganic
and protein macroions can be regulated correspondingly. The major
driving force for the blackberry structure formation is the counterion-mediated
electrostatic interaction, and the size of blackberry structure is
sensitive to the macroion’s charge density, which is controlled
by the degree of deprotonation, solvent polarity, and/or ionic strength.33−36 Take {Mo132} cluster37 in
water/acetone as an example, highly charged macroions (−0.25
C m–2) cannot self-assemble due to the strong repulsion
between each other, whereas lowering charge density facilitates the
blackberry structure formation.37 This
is the same with capsid formation when the charge density of capsid
protein is reduced by decreasing pH or adding salts. However, the
size of blackberry structures can be reversibly tuned by changing
the macroionic charges, which is not observed for HBV Cp149 capsid.
In addition, the assembly rate for capsid protein is much faster than
inorganic clusters. It takes hours or days for capsid formation to
reach equilibrium, whereas weeks or even longer for blackberry structures.
These differences can be attributed to the fact that the POM clusters
do not have hydrophobic parts and the macroion–counterion interaction
is dominant (the contributions of van der Waals attraction and hydrogen
bonding are negligible), whereas capsid protein has special hydrophobic
parts on its edges, which brings geometrical restriction to the capsid
size. Because the hydrophobic attraction is a strong short−range
noncovalent interaction, the capsid formation is much faster than
blackberry formation. Also due to the existence of hydrophobic contact,
dimers in capsid form direct dimer–dimer contacts which deprive
them of free rotation, whereas POMs in blackberry structures are still
single macroions with an interval distance of ∼0.4–0.7
nm. Therefore, once capsids are formed with preferred dimer orientation,
it is difficult to change the capsid size even if conditions are varied,
but the blackberry structures can adjust their sizes in response to
conditions. Therefore, the protein–counterion interaction can
affect the capsid formation kinetically and thermodynamically but
not to alter capsid size.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a series of studies were conducted to determine the
effect of HBV Cp149 protein charge density on its in vitro capsid
formation. A mutant D2N/D4N dimer with exactly the same structural
conformation as WT Cp1492 but with four fewer negative
charges at neutral pH was designed to probe the effect of charge.
The kinetic and thermodynamic outcomes of capsid formation were identical
for the WT and D2N/D4N dimers when they were charge matched, confirming
that the capsid formation was controlled by the effective surface
charge density (macroion–macroion repulsion) and the charge
screening effect macroion–counterion interaction). A lower
protein charge density favored capsid formation due to reduced electrostatic
repulsion. The major impact of salts (ionic strength) was to screen
this repulsion and balance the hydrophobic attraction, which was consequently
important in regulating the speed of capsid formation and the amount
of capsid at equilibrium. Experimental results also suggested that
the charge number of WT Cp1492 at physiological pH and
ionic strength was well chosen by nature for an optimized balance
between the efficient capsid generation and capsid stability. The
way we treated capsid proteins as macroions to analyze HBV capsid
formation could also be applied to many other viral capsids and self-assembled
biological complexes. The fundamental understanding of electrostatic
interaction in capsid formation, which was largely ignored before,
could also lead to the development of new antiviral drugs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Protein Expression, Purification,
and Characterization
For tag-free expression, the gene of
WT HBV Cp149 was cloned into
the expression vector pET24a, and the sequence was confirmed via DNA
sequencing. The plasmid pET24A−Cp149 was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) strain for protein
expression. A single colony was used to inoculate 10 mL of lysogeny
broth (LB) media supplemented with 50 μg mL–1 kanamycin (kan). The culture was incubated by shaking overnight
and then diluted into 1 L fresh LB/kan media. When OD600 reached 0.8,
isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside was added to
a final concentration of 2 mM to induce the expression of Cp149. Cells
were incubated for another 5 h before collected by centrifugation
at 7000g for 10 min. Purification was conducted following
procedures as previously described.15 To
construct a Cp149 mutant with a lower surface charge density, the
negatively charged Asp2 and Asp4 were simultaneously replaced with
Asn. Due to their close locations on the primary sequence, mutagenesis
of these two sites was achieved via a single step of mutagenesis using
the QuikChange Mutagenesis System (Agilent Genomics). The resultant
mutant Cp149−D2N/D4N could be expressed to a similar level
as the WT protein in E. coli, and the
same purification procedure was conducted to extract the mutant (Figure S1B). Both WT and D2N/D4N mutant exist
as a homodimer Cp1492 in solution. Circular dichroism (CD)
and fluorescence spectra of the WT and mutant Cp149 dimer protein
were directly compared, and the overlapping of the two traces indicated
that the Asp to Asn mutation at the N-terminus did not affect the
overall conformation of the subunit (Figure S1D,E). Furthermore, purified D2N/D4N dimer showed a lower mobility under
electronic field due to its four negative charges fewer on each Cp149
dimer (Figure S1C).

4.2 In Vitro
Cp149 Dimer Assembly
The
stock solutions of WT and mutant Cp1492 were first dialyzed
into the desired buffer at 4 °C overnight. Protein concentrations
were determined through UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction
coefficient of 29 280 cm–1 M–1 (for protein monomer). A 2.7 M KCl stock solution was prepared using
the corresponding buffer and filtered before titrating into filtered
protein solution. The assembly process was monitored using laser light
scattering at 22 °C. The buffer systems used in this study were:
pH 7.5 HEPES (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME), pH
adjusted by NaOH); pH 9.6 NaHCO3 (50 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM BME, pH adjusted by NaOH); pH 6.6–9.2 Tris (50 mM
Trizma, 10 mM BME, pH adjusted by HCl).

4.3 Laser
Light Scattering
A commercial
Brookhaven Instrument laser light scattering spectrometer equipped
with a solid-state laser operating at 532 nm was used for both static
light scattering (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.
The calibration intensity is 33.9 kcps, which is the scattered intensity
of benzene at 90°. DLS measures the intensity–intensity
time correlation function by means of a BI-9000AT multichannel digital
correlator. The field correlation function |g(1)(τ)| was analyzed by the constrained regularized CONTIN38 method to yield information on the distribution
of the characteristic line width Γ. The normalized distribution
function of the characteristic line width, G(Γ),
so obtained, can be used to determine an average apparent translational
diffusion coefficient, Dapp = Γ/q2, where q is the scattering
factor. The hydrodynamic radius Rh is
related to D via the Stokes–Einstein equation: Rh = kT/(6πηD) where k is the Boltzmann constant and
η the viscosity of the solvent at temperature T. From DLS measurements, the particle−size distribution in
solution is obtained from a plot of ΓG(Γ)
vs Rh.

4.4 Transmission
Electron Microscope (TEM)
The overall structure of assembled
Cp149 capsids was characterized
using a JEOL-1230 electron microscope with an accelerating voltage
of 120 kV. Samples for the TEM analysis were prepared by the standard
negative staining method. A droplet of 8 μL sample solution
was placed onto a carbon film-coated copper grid (Ted Pella, Inc.),
incubated for 90 s and then washed with water. The sample was stained
using 1% uranyl acetate for 90 s. The excess staining solution was
removed, and the copper grid was left dry overnight prior to taking
TEM images.

4.5 Size Exclusion Chromatography
(SEC)
SEC was performed using a 0.5 cm width Econo column
packed with Sephacryl
S-300 HR medium. The column was pre-equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES
or 50 mM Tris buffer as used for the Cp1492 assembly reaction
plus 150 mM KCl to prevent capsids from disassembly during separation.
80 μL of assembly solution was injected onto the column under
a mild pressure of 3 psi, and the peaks of capsids and dimers were
determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm via a Hewlett Packard Variable
Wavelength Detector. Baseline was corrected and subtracted using Origin,
and the integrated peak areas were used to calculate the capsid and
dimer concentrations.
