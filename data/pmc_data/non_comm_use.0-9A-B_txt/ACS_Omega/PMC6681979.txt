Efficient delivery of therapeutics
across the cell membrane to
the interior of the cell remains a challenge both in vitro and in
vivo. Here, we demonstrate that vesicles derived from cellular membranes
can be efficiently loaded with cargo that can then be delivered to
the interior of the cell. These vesicles demonstrated cell-targeting
specificity as well as the ability to deliver a wide range of different
cargos. We utilized this approach to deliver both lipophilic and hydrophilic
cargos including therapeutics and DNA in vitro. We further demonstrated
in vivo targeting and delivery using fluorescently labeled vesicles
to target tumor xenografts in an animal. Cell-derived vesicles can
be generated in high yields and are easily loaded with a variety of
cargos. The ability of these vesicles to specifically target the same
cell type from which they originated provides an efficient means of
delivering cargo, such as therapeutics, both in vitro and in vivo.

Introduction
The effective delivery
of cargos such as fluorescent markers, genetic
material, therapeutics, and proteins to the interior of the cell is
essential for the development of new therapeutics and for understanding
biological function.1−4 Despite advances in areas such as gene delivery,5 targeted therapeutics, vesicle-based delivery systems,6,7 and the use of cell-penetrating peptides,8 the efficient transport of cargo across the cell membrane remains
one of the primary challenges to the development of therapeutics.
The most common strategies for accessing the interior of the cell
utilize endocytic pathways. While this provides a relatively efficient
means of crossing the cell membrane, it results in the trapping of
cargo in endosomal vesicles. The cargo must then escape from these
vesicles, however, lowering both the efficiency and the potential
efficacy of therapeutics.9 This increases
the complexity of cargo delivery for both cell culture-based and in
vivo applications. Ideal delivery vehicles would allow for the direct
transport of cargo to the interior of the cell, bypassing endocytosis
altogether.

Vesicles composed of phospholipid bilayers have
shown promise as
therapeutic delivery vectors capable of encapsulating the cargo and
delivering it to the interior of target cells.10,11 Synthetic vesicles such as liposomes composed of phospholipid membranes
are relatively easy to load and have shown promise as in vitro and
in vivo intracellular delivery devices.7,12−14 However, applications are limited by a lack of biocompatibility,
as liposomes are not capable of avoiding the immune system for in
vivo delivery. Naturally occurring vesicles produced by cells are
an attractive alternative. For example, exosomes have received significant
attention as therapeutic delivery vehicles to transport cargo across
cell membranes because they are both nonimmunogenic and specifically
target select cell types.11,15−18 While cell specificity addresses a major problem with targeted therapeutic
delivery, the application of exosomes as cellular delivery devices
is limited by low production efficiency and difficulty in loading
with cargo. Despite these limitations, exosomes have been utilized
for in vitro delivery of therapeutics and for gene delivery. Recently,
vesicles generated from the membranes of organelles within the cells
were used as exosome-mimics and retained several of the targeting
properties seen with exosomes.19−22

Several key factors need to be considered for
the development of
intracellular delivery vectors. Loading of the cargo must be efficient
and easy and the vehicle must also be compatible with a wide range
of cargo. Here, we develop cell-derived vesicles that can be easily
loaded with cargo and exhibit cell-targeting capabilities. We harness
these vesicles as general cell-delivery vehicles that can deliver
a wide range of cargos including genetic material, therapeutics, protein,
and fluorescent markers to the interior of cells both in vitro and
in vivo.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Cell-Derived Vesicles
We generated
vesicles through nitrogen cavitation23 where
cells in solution are subjected to high-pressure N2. The
pressure is rapidly released resulting in the formation of gas bubbles
that fragment the cellular membranes. These small fragments then reform
to generate enclosed vesicles. We separate vesicles from the remaining
cell debris through a series of centrifugation steps. A schematic
of the vesicle generation and isolation process is shown in Scheme 1. One advantage of
this approach is that the solution containing the cells during cavitation
is encapsulated in the vesicles. Thus, therapeutics or other cargos
are entrapped in the vesicles with high efficiency at the time of
vesicle formation. An image of vesicles generated using nitrogen cavitation
from human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK) formed in the presence
of fluorescein, a fluorescent dye, is shown in Figure 1A. The fluorescence image shows punctate
regions indicating that the fluorophore is trapped inside the vesicles
verifying encapsulation. The cargo, encapsulated by a phospholipid
bilayer, is safeguarded from free solution. To illustrate the versatility
of this approach we performed a series of studies using vesicles from
HEK, human colorectal cancer (HCT 116), human lung cancer (A549),
and macrophage-like cell lines (RAW 264.7).

Scheme 1 Schematic of Vesicle Generation, Loading, and Isolation
Cultured cells undergo nitrogen
cavitation in the presence of cargo in free solution followed by serial
centrifugation to generate purified vesicles. Vesicles serve as nanocarriers
for hydrophilic cargo encapsulated during cavitation on the interior
or for lipophilic cargo that can be embedded in the vesicle membrane.

The collection of vesicles
endogenously expressed by cells, such
as exosomes, suffers from relatively poor yields.24,25 To determine the yield of our preparation, we performed fluorescence
correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Vesicles were generated from approximately
40 million A549 cells in culture using nitrogen cavitation. After
the vesicles were isolated, they were labeled through the incorporation
of a lipophilic dialkylcarbocyanine fluorophore (DiI), which is nonfluorescent
in an aqueous solution but emits brightly when embedded in a lipid
bilayer. FCS tracks fluctuations in fluorescence as vesicles diffuse
through the focal volume.26,27 Both the diffusion
time and the average number of molecules can be extracted from the
autocorrelation curve (Figure 1B). The FCS focal volume was calibrated using commercial tetraspeck
beads leading to a determination that our preparations yielded ∼4
× 1011 vesicles per mL, which is approximately 1.3
× 1011 vesicles per preparation (40 million cells).
Thus, we were able to generate a relatively large number of vesicles
from a modest number of cells.

To further characterize cell-derived
vesicles, we performed dynamic
light scattering (DLS) to determine the diameter of vesicles generated
via nitrogen cavitation. Figure 1C shows the distribution of vesicle diameters of a
typical preparation at different pressures. The 200 nm observed at
300 psi is slightly larger than standard exosomes (100 to 150 nm)
but is within a similar range that is unlikely to affect cell delivery.
To determine stability, we also measured the surface charge (zeta
potential) of cell-derived vesicles suspended in a PBS buffer. Vesicles
preparations exhibited a surface charge of −2.5 mV. DLS measurements
of vesicles in solution after 6 h showed no changes in size distributions
over time. To determine how pressure influenced the diameter of vesicles,
we generated vesicles with nitrogen cavitation pressures of 300 (red),
600 (black), and 900 psi (blue) (Figure 1C). Interestingly, 300 psi yields the smallest
vesicles whereas 900 psi yielded the largest. Vesicle size was clearly
dependent on the cavitation pressure. In addition to yielding tunable
vesicle diameters, one advantage of cavitation over other techniques
to fracture the membrane is that it does not generate heat that can
damage samples or alter the chemical composition of the cell medium.
This results in the formation of relatively uniform vesicles likely
due to all the cells in solution being exposed to the same pressure
conditions.28

Determining Vesicle Targeting
Specificity across Different Cell
Types
Previous studies have shown that exosomes and vesicles
generated from cancer cells preferentially target the same cell type
from which they were derived.19,29 To determine the degree
of targeting specificity of vesicles generated via nitrogen across
cell types, we performed a series of studies comparing the delivery
of labeled vesicles to the cell type from which the vesicles originated
versus alternate cell types. We first generated vesicles from HEK
cells and labeled them with DiI. We then determined the efficiency
of delivery to both HEK and A549 cells by measuring the fluorescence
signal at time points over 4 h. We added 5 × 109 vesicles
to each cell culture condition and allowed them to incubate with the
cells. Vesicles were then rinsed from the cells, and the cells were
subsequently imaged using wide-field microscopy. Most cell types showed
a clear targeting specificity for the cell type where they originated.
At the 2 h time point of HEK vesicle delivery, HEK cells exhibited
∼10 times as much fluorescence as A549 cells after incubation
with the same number of vesicles for the same time period (Figure 2A). Similarly, RAW
vesicles were much more efficiently delivered (8×) to RAW cells
as they were to A549 cells (Figure 2B). We also compared the delivery of different vesicles
to the same cell type. While HCT vesicles were approximately 3 times
more efficient at delivering cargo to HCT cells as compared to RAW
vesicles, the RAW vesicles still exhibited targeting properties for
the HCT cells (Figure 2C). Combined results show that vesicles tend to have an affinity
for the delivery of cargo to the same cell type from which they originated.
The wide-field image comparing RAW vesicle delivery to RAW cells versus
delivery to A549 cells after 2.5 h (Figure 2D,E) shows a clear preference for delivery
to RAW cells. However, the ability of RAW vesicles to effectively
target cancer cells with only a 3-fold deficit as compared to cancer
vesicles could allow macrophage vesicles to be used as a general delivery
vehicle. The use of cancer vesicles for clinical application is limited
due to the likelihood for them to increase the metastatic potential
in vivo. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment consists of a heterogenous
mixture of cells including large numbers of macrophages. Thus, macrophages
offer better long-term potential for clinical applications. These
studies illustrate the ability of nanoscale cell-derived vesicles
to deliver lipophilic cargo to cells.

Each end point was significant with a p value of
<.001.

Determining in Vitro Efficacy
for Therapeutic Delivery
The efficient delivery of therapeutics
to the interior of the cell
is one of the primary challenges of cell delivery vehicles. We performed
a set of experiments to measure the efficiency of drug loading into
cell-derived vesicles and then the efficiency of delivery to cancer
cells. We generated vesicles from A549 cells in the presence of 8.33
mM cisplatin. To verify that the vesicles successfully encapsulated
cisplatin, we measured the drug concentration in the vesicles directly
after formation and separation from free cisplatin. The cisplatin
in vesicles as measured by ICP-OES for 1.3 × 1011 vesicles
was ∼3 μg of total cisplatin. This effectively shows
that the vesicles generated from nitrogen cavitation can encapsulate
cisplatin at the time of formation, protecting it from the environment
outside of the vesicle. To further verify that stability of encapsulation
over time, we performed the same ICP-OES studies at intervals over
3 days after drug encapsulation on the supernatant to measure any
cisplatin leakage from the vesicles. Vesicles maintain roughly the
same concentration at each time point showing the stability of encapsulation
with a total decrease of 23 ng of cisplatin from day 1 through day
3. Cell-derived vesicles are able to efficiently encapsulate a large
concentration of chemotherapeutics and remain stable over 2 days with
no apparent leakage. We then performed cell delivery experiments to
determine if we could utilize drug-loaded vesicles for therapeutic
delivery by comparing the efficacy of free cisplatin to that of cisplatin
encapsulated in vesicles.

We first performed a control study
to determine whether the vesicles themselves had any effect on cell
growth. We generated unloaded A549-derived vesicles and delivered
them to A549 cells. We determined cell viability using a fluorescence
assay (alamar blue), where the fluorescence intensity scales with
the population of live cells. Comparing cell growth and viability
to that of untreated cells, empty vesicles appeared to have no effect
on cell growth (Figure 3). With a clear indication that vesicles targeted the same cells
from which they originated (Figure 2A–C) and that vesicles did not alter cell viability,
we compared the effect of free cisplatin and cisplatin-loaded vesicles
on A549 cell proliferation. We chose cisplatin because of its hydrophilic
nature and because it is a first-line therapeutic for lung cancer.
Vesicles were loaded through nitrogen cavitation in the presence of
cisplatin (8.33 mM). Vesicles were then added to A549 cells in culture,
and we compared the cell proliferation to cells alone and those in
the presence of free cisplatin in solution at the same levels (3 μg)
as we measured in the vesicle solution. This low concentration of
free cisplatin resulted in no apparent cell death at 24 h while cisplatin-loaded
vesicles resulted in 70% cell death. By the 48 h time point, loaded
cell-derived vesicles resulted in 90% cell death, while free cisplatin
resulted in 15% cell death. At 72 h,, free cisplatin led to 50% cell
death while vesicles maintained approximately 90% cell death. Vesicles
(1 × 1010) containing .3 μg of cisplatin (∼4
μM) delivered to A549 cells were much more effective at limiting
cell viability than the same concentration of free cisplatin. This
verified the capability of the vesicles to more efficiently deliver
the drug across the cell membrane.

at time 0, 24, 48, and 72 h for A549 cells with no treatment (black),
treated with empty vesicles (gray), with cisplatin-loaded vesicles
(purple), and free cisplatin in solution (pink). Empty vesicles have
no effect on cell growth while both free cisplatin and loaded vesicles
show similar efficacy in killing A549 cells. Each data point is the
average of five experiments. A Student’s t-test was used to determine significance. The asterisk “*”
indicates a p value of <.001.

Cell Derived Vesicles for Gene Delivery
To demonstrate
the versatility of vesicle-based delivery, we also encapsulated plasmid
DNA for gene delivery. Current strategies for gene delivery primarily
use transfection reagents such as cationic lipids for efficient delivery.
We generated vesicles in the presence of a plasmid that encoded for
the fluorescent protein Dendra2. Vesicles were loaded via the same
nitrogen cavitation approach and then incubated with HEK cells for
48 h. The cells were then visualized using wide-field fluorescence
microscopy to identify cells expressing the fluorescent protein. Virtually
none of the control cells showed any fluorescence. The two cells exhibiting
any fluorescence (Figure 4A) in the control sample correspond to autofluorescence from
dead cells in the field of view and the rest of the live cells show
no fluorescence as indicated in the bright-field image shown in the
Supporting Information (Figure S1A). The
majority of HEK cells in the vesicle-treated sample had taken up the
plasmid and produced a characteristic green fluorescence. The bright-field
image is shown in Supporting Information (Figure S1B). Here we used ∼1 × 1010 vesicles
for delivery. As can be seen from the similar level of fluorescence
across most cells, the delivery in culture and loading of vesicles
appeared to be homogenous across the sample. This verifies that vesicles
are capable of delivering DNA across the cell membrane to the interior
of the cell.

cells
in the absence of plasmid. (B) Wide-field image of HEK cells after
exposure to Dendra2 plasmid-loaded vesicles showing clear cellular
delivery based on the expression of the fluorescent protein.

Delivery of Hydrophilic
Cargo
To visualize the delivery
of cargo to the cell interior, we generated vesicles while simultaneously
encapsulating the green emitting fluorophore, fluorescein. After generating
the vesicles, we then labeled the vesicle membrane with DiD, a lipophilic
dye. This allowed us to observe the delivery of cargo within the vesicles
to the interior of the cell as well as observe integration of the
vesicle membrane into the membrane of the target cells. After 45 min
of exposure, vesicles were rinsed from the cells and we performed
confocal imaging. Clear fluorescein fluorescence permeated the interior
of the cell indicating its presence in the cytosol (Figure 5). At the same time, isolated
vesicles were observed on the cell surface. The presence of fluorescein
in the cytosol after only 45 min verifies the encapsulation and delivery
of hydrophilic cargo. Individual vesicles labeled with DiD were observed
on the cell surface.

HEK 293
cells after the delivery of vesicles loaded with fluorescein (interior)
and DiD (cell membrane). The interior of the cell is filled with fluorescein
and vesicles can be seen on the cell surface.

In Vivo Targeting and Delivery of Vesicles
We also
performed a set of studies to determine if cell-derived vesicles could
be used to target a specific tissue in a live animal. We generated
vesicles from HEK cells, A549 cells, and RAW 264.7 cells and labeled
each separately with DiR to enable tracking to specific sites within
the animal. RAW cells were used because the tumor environment contains
large numbers of macrophages, RAW vesicles showed some targeting affinity
for cancer cells, and targeting delivery with cancer cell-derived
vesicles is not feasible for clinical applications. There is concern
for the potential of cancer vesicles to lead to an increase in the
spread of cancer throughout the body. We used a male outbred athymic
nude (nu/nu) mouse from Jackson Laboratories implanted with a subcutaneous
tumor xenograft composed of A549 or HCT116 cells. After the tumor
reached at least 100 mm3, we injected labeled vesicles
(∼2 × 1011), systemically, through the tail
vein. In vivo imaging was performed 24 h postinjection using an IVIS
whole animal imager. Injection of DiR alone lead to nonspecific accumulation,
while HEK vesicles accumulated in the area of the bladder (Figure 6A,B). Clear fluorescence
was observed in the tumor site for the delivery of A549 and RAW vesicles
(Figure 6C,D). These
experiments verify the in vivo targeting capability of both A549 vesicles
and RAW vesicles for the tumor xenograft.

cells, and (D) dye-labeled vesicles derived from RAW264.7 cells demonstrating

Conclusions
These studies demonstrate that cell-derived
vesicles can be efficiently
loaded with a wide variety of cargos. They also exhibit similar properties
as exosomes in that they specifically target the cell from which they
originated. However, cell-derived vesicles can be easily loaded and
generated at higher yields than exosomes. These properties can be
harnessed to efficiently deliver cargos ranging from therapeutics
to DNA across the cell membrane. These vesicles demonstrated targeting
efficiency in animals as shown through their delivery to tumor sites.
Overall, cell-derived vesicles can be used as a versatile cell delivery
vehicle both in vitro and in vivo.

Experimental Section
Cisplatin
Delivery
A549 cells (60 million) were used
to generate vesicles for delivery. Cells were scraped from culture
in 20 mL of sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitor. The cell
solution was collected in a 50 mL conical tube and pelleted at 2000
rpm at 25 °C for 2 min. The solution was aspirated off, and the
pellet was resuspended in 8 mL of 8.33 mM cisplatin in sucrose buffer
solution or 20 mg cisplatin/8 mL sucrose buffer solution plus protease
inhibitor. The cell solution was fragmented using N2 cavitation
at 300 psi at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting cell slurry was centrifuged
at 4000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
from centrifugation was transferred to a 25 mL ultracentrifuge tube
for 10,000g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant from the UCF tube was then transferred to a new 25
mL ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet in the UCF tube was washed with
500 μL of sucrose solution, and the residual solution was pipetted
out and discarded. Seven hundred fifty microliters of sucrose buffer
solution was added to the UCF tube, and the pellet was resuspended
via pipetting. Empty vesicles were generated in the exact same way
except in the absence of cisplatin.

A549 cells (30,000) were
plated in each well of a 96-well plate and allowed to seed for 24
h. During that time, the growth media was exchanged for 250 μL
of fresh HEK media containing either cisplatin in solution (4.17 mM),
cisplatin-loaded vesicles, empty vesicles, or untreated media cisplatin
solution in HEK media. The media was aspirated off. Two hundred microliters
of Optimem was added followed by 20 μL of alamar blue. The plate
was left to incubate at 37 °C with gentle tapping every 10 min
for 40–45 min to ensure uniform turnover to a brilliant purple.
The plate was read using a FlexStation plate reader.

Gene Delivery
HEK cells (32 million) were scraped with
10 mL of sucrose buffer solution with protease inhibitor. All of the
cell solution was collected into a 15 mL conical tube and pelleted
at 2000 rpm at 25 °C for 2 min. The solution was aspirated off
and resuspended in 3 mL sucrose buffer solution plus protease inhibitor.
Plasmid (75 μg of Dendra2) was added to the N2 cavitation
chamber. The solution was fragmented using N2 cavitation
at 600 psi at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell slurry was centrifuged
at 4000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
from centrifugation was transferred to a 25 mL ultracentrifuge tube
and centrifuged at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant from the UCF tube was then transferred to a new 25
mL ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet in the UCF tube was washed with
500 μL sucrose solution, and the residual solution was pipetted
out and discarded. One milliliter of sucrose buffer solution was added
to the UCF tube, and the pellet was resuspended via pipetting. Two
hundred fifty microliters of this solution was added to 30,000 HEK
cells plated on glass bottom dishes. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed
and then imaged at 48 h using a wide-field microscope with a 488 nm
band-pass filter for excitation.

Vesicle Delivery
Vesicles were prepared as described
above. The vesicle solution was mixed in an Eppendorf tube (1 mL)
with 2 μL of 2 mM DiI and left to incubate for 30 min at 37
°C. Labeled vesicles were separated from free fluorescein/DiI
using a PD MidiTrap equilibrated with sucrose buffer solution. One
hundred eighty microliters of the vesicle solution was added to cells
plated on glass bottom dishes. Cells were imaged using an excitation
wavelength of 561 nm after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C. Control
studies to determine the leaching of encapsulated and membrane-bound
fluorophores were performed. Vesicles with either DiI or fluorescein
were incubated in solution for 4 h to mimic the conditions of cell
labeling. After 4 h, the vesicles were pelleted using ultracentrifugation.
The supernatant was then added to the cell culture to determine the
presence of any free dye. No visible fluorescence was observed for
control studies with fluorescein or with DiI.

In Vivo Xenograft
Athymic nude mice were injected with
A549 cells (NSCLC, immortalized) in the right shoulder and monitored
for 3–4 weeks until measurable xenograft tumors were observed.
RAW cells were cultured in vitro by standard methods. Cell-derived
vesicles were manufactured by the Richards lab as described above
and loaded with DiR near-infrared fluorescent dye. Prepared vesicles
were administered, and mice were then imaged approximately 24, 48,
and 72 hours later. Mice were anesthetized for imaging using isoflurane.
Epifluorescence was measured using an IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging
System (PerkinElmer). Vesicles were labeled with DiR near-infrared
fluorescent dye, which was excited at 710 nm, with emission measured
at 780 nm. Fluorescent signal intensity (i.e., total radiant efficiency)
within regions of interest (ROI) were quantified using Living Image
software (PerkinElmer), correcting for background fluorescence using
distal site ROI within the same mouse.

RAW264.7 cells (100 million)
were scraped in 40 mL of sucrose buffer solution with protease inhibitor.
Vesicles were prepared as described above. The cells were labeled
using DiR at 2 μM for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were injected
intravenously to the mouse, through the tail vein. Approximately 1
× 1011 vesicles were delivered per injection. All
animal experiments were repeated three times.

Determining Cisplatin Concentration
Vesicles were generated
as described above in the presence of 8.33 mM cisplatin in sucrose
buffer solution. To release cisplatin from the vesicles, they were
treated with 5 μL (1%) Triton X-100 followed by 500 μL
of 70% nitric acid and incubated on a heat block at 60 °C for
2 h. The solution was diluted to 5 mL of 1% nitric acid and analyzed
using ICP-OES (Varian Vista Pro).

To determine the amount of
leakage into the solution from the vesicles, the supernatant of the
vesicle solution was collected after the vesicles were pelleted using
ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was then diluted in 5 mL of 1%
nitric acid and analyzed using ICP-OES. Separately, vesicles were
stored for 1, 2, and 3 days. At each time point, the vesicles were
pelleted, and the supernatant was collected and analyzed for cisplatin
using ICP-OES. A standard curve was generated using standard concentrations
of platinum in 1% nitric acid ranging from 1 ppm to 10 ppb. Ytterbium
was used as in the internal standard to compensate for the internal
drift of the instrument.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Vesicles
were prepared as
described above. The vesicle solution was then diluted (1:20) and
analyzed using DLS.

Cell Specificity
HEK vesicles onto
HEK and A549 cells:
64 million HEK were used to generate vesicles for delivery. Cells
were scraped from culture in 20 mL of sucrose buffer containing protease
inhibitor. The cell solution was collected in a 50 mL conical tube
and pelleted at 2000 rpm at 25 °C for 2 min. The solution was
aspirated off such that the final volume was 10 mL. The cell solution
was fragmented using N2 cavitation at 300 psi at 4 °C
for 5 min. The resulting cell slurry was centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from centrifugation
was transferred to a 25 mL ultracentrifuge tube for 10,000g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
from the UCF tube was then transferred to a new 25 mL ultracentrifuge
tube and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at 4
°C. The pellet in the UCF tube was washed with 500 μL of
sucrose solution, and the residual solution was pipetted out and discarded.
One thousand microliters of sucrose buffer solution was added to the
UCF tube, and the pellet was resuspended via pipetting. Two microliters
of 1 mM DiI was added to the resuspension and left to incubate for
30 min at 37 °C. After this time, the vesicles were purified
from the free dye using a PD MidiTrap. Fifty microliters of the purified
vesicles was added into each glass bottom dish containing 90,000 HEK
or A549 cells plated 24 h prior.

This procedure was repeated
for RAW vesicles on RAW and A549 cells using 54 million cells to generate
vesicles.

The above protocol was repeated for HCT vesicles on
HCT cells and
RAW vesicles on HCT cells using 70.4 and 56.8 million cells, respectively,
to generate vesicles. Since HCT cells grow at a faster rate than most
other cell types we used, we plated 50,000 cells onto glass bottom
dishes instead of the traditional 90,000 cells.

Fluorescence
Correlation Spectroscopy
Forty million
A549 cells were scraped from the culture in 20 mL of sucrose buffer
containing protease inhibitor. The cell solution was collected in
a 50 mL conical tube and pelleted at 2000 rpm at 25 °C for 2
min. The solution was aspirated off such that the final volume was
10 mL. The cell solution was fragmented using N2 cavitation
at 250 psi at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting cell slurry was centrifuged
at 4000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
from centrifugation was transferred to a 25 mL ultracentrifuge tube
for 10,000g centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant from the UCF tube was then transferred to a new 25
mL ultracentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellet in the UCF tube was washed with
1 mL of PBS, and the residual solution was pipetted out and discarded.
Three hundred microliters of PBS was added to the UCF tube, and the
pellet was resuspended via pipetting. DiI (2 μM) was added to
the resuspension and left to incubate for 40 min at 37 °C. After
this time, the vesicles were purified from the free dye using a 450
nm Corning sterile syringe filter only after the filter was pre-saturated
with 150 μL of PBS. The solution was then diluted 1:2, and then
20 μL was placed onto a coverslip mounted on a 60× water
objective. A 532 nm laser (45 mW) was used as an excitation source.
A picoquant PicoHarp 300 photon counting system was used to time tag
photon arrival events.
