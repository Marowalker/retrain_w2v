Platinum
(Pt)-decorated graphene-based carbon composite electrodes
with controlled dimensionality were successfully fabricated via core–shell
electrospinning/electrospraying techniques. In this process, multilayer
graphene sheets were converted into the three different forms, fiber,
sphere, and foam, by tailoring the polymer concentration, molecular
weight of polymer, and applied voltage. As polymer concentration increased,
continuous fibers were produced, whereas decreasing polymer concentration
caused the formation of graphene-based foam. In addition, the reduction
in polymer molecular weight in electrospun solution led to the creation
of three-dimensional (3D) spherical structures. In this work, graphene-based
foam was produced for the first time by utilizing core–shell
electrospraying technology instead of available chemical vapor deposition
techniques. The effect of morphologies and dimensions of carbonized
graphene-based carbon electrodes on its electrochemical behavior was
investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge
methods. Among the three different electrodes, Pt-supported 3D graphene-based
spheres showed the highest specific capacitance of 118 F/g at a scan
rate of 1 mV/s owing to the homogeneous decoration of Pt particles
with a small diameter of 4 nm on the surface. After 1000 cycles of
charging–discharging, Pt-decorated graphene-based structures
showed high cyclic stability and retention of capacitance, indicating
their potential as high-performance electrodes for energy storage
devices.

1 Introduction
In
the recent years, a rapid increase in the global energy consumption
has persuaded scientists to develop new eco-friendly energy storage
devices. In the field of energy storage, electrode design plays a
significant role by providing high surface area, fast electron mobility,
high electrical conductivity, and good chemical stability to attain
high electrochemical performance.1 Especially,
carbon materials are widely used as electrode material in electrochemical
energy storage systems owing to their rich variety of dimensionality
and large surface area.2 Among various
carbon-based materials, graphene becomes a promising candidate since
it has long-range π conjugation and thus fast electron mobility,
which makes it extremely attractive for energy storage devices.3 Different types of graphene production techniques
exist using top-down and bottom-up approaches. The main problem in
the utilization of graphene in bulk applications is its restacking
and agglomeration and the formation of crumpled structure, leading
to a significant decrease in the surface area and electrical conductivity
and thus great loss of electrochemical activity. Up to now, many efforts
have been made to overcome this obstacle by the integration of two-dimensional
(2D) graphene sheets into macroscopic structures through different
methods, including chemical vapor deposition, encapsulation, self-assembly,
and wet spinning.4,5 With these methods, it is possible
to convert graphene into several structures, such as graphene fibers,6 spheres,7 films,8 and networks.9

Template-assisted method and self-assembly technique are the most
commonly used strategies to obtain three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based
structures. In one of the studies, Fan et al.10 fabricated graphene-wrapped polyaniline hollow spheres as an electrode
material by using polystyrene spheres as template and obtained a high
specific capacitance of 614 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and
maintained the capacitance at around 90% after 500 cycles. In another
work, Xu et al.11 produced microporous
carbon spheres incorporated into 3D graphene frameworks via wet chemistry
and self-assembly techniques, which showed a specific capacitance
of 288.8 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. However, in these aforementioned
processes, it is not easy to control structural properties such as
porosity and hollowness since the morphology directly depends on the
chosen templates. At this point, electrospinning is an alternative
and easy method for the production of graphene-based structures in
the form of spheres12,13 and fibers14 by adjusting the polymer concentration and surface tension
of a droplet. The electrodes produced by electrospinning have an ability
to form a continuous network, which is essential for the charge transport
and provides conducting framework and excellent interconnectivity.
In one work, Kim et al.15 examined the
electrochemical behavior of graphene/carbon nanofiber composite electrode
produced via classical electrospinning technique by using graphene
oxide (GO) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as carbon precursor having
high conductivity and a specific capacitance of 146.6 F/g at a current
density of 1 mA/cm2. Recently, core–shell electrospinning
has received great attention for attaining multifunctionality and
utilization of different materials in a one-step process by elimination
of coating and deposition steps and thus expansion of the potential
applications of fabricated structures.14,16 Kou et al.17 fabricated polyelectrolyte-wrapped graphene
core–sheath fibers by high-energy-density electronics by coaxial
electrospinning of reduced GO solution as core and sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose as shell material, followed by reduction and washing processes.
Instead of morphology design in electrode structures, the integration
of noble metals improves electrical conductivity and electrochemical
stability in graphene electrodes used in Li-ion batteries, fuel cells,
and supercapacitors.18 For instance, Zhang
et al.19 fabricated graphene/Pt films having
a high capacitance of 120 F/g at a high scan rate of 50 A/g to enhance
the conductivity of charges and thus give higher reversible capacitance
at high rates. So far, there have been several attempts at the fabrication
of graphene-based fibers as electrodes in the energy storage systems
by applying classical and core–shell electrospinning techniques.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no related work on control
of the dimensions of graphene-based electrodes in different forms
such as foam and sphere by applying core–shell electrospinning
technology.

In the present study, Pt-deposited one-dimensional
(1D) graphene-based
fiber and 3D graphene-based sphere and foam electrodes were produced
by core–shell electrospinning/electrospraying techniques. Figure 1 shows the schematic
representation of the fabrication process for Pt-decorated graphene-based
foam, fibers, and spheres by core–shell electrospraying. During
electrospinning, thermally exfoliated multilayer graphene layers were
transformed into the three different forms, fiber, foam, and sphere,
by using a carrier polymer by altering solution parameters such as
polymer concentration and molecular weight of polymer and the process
parameter of applied voltage. In the electrode structure, PAN polymer
was used as a carrier to increase carbon network. Because of the high
catalytic activity and good chemical stability against oxidation,
Pt particles were chosen as catalyst and deposited at low loading
in the structures. Structural and morphological properties of structures
were analyzed by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques in detail.
The electrochemical performance of Pt-deposited graphene-based carbon
structures as electrodes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
and galvanostatic charge–discharge.

graphene-based foam, fibers, and spheres.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect
of Polymer Concentration on the Morphology
of Electrospun Structures
In the electrospinning process,
viscosity of the solution plays an important role in determining the
final morphology of electrospun structures. During the electrospinning
process, when the droplet at the tip of the nozzle is being subjected
to the electric field, it starts to distort, which is a result of
a balancing force between the electric field and surface tension of
the droplet. When the surface tension of the droplet is overcome by
the voltage, a polymeric jet is initiated from the nozzle tip to the
collector. The viscosity of the solution depends on the polymer molecular
weight and concentration of polymeric solution. In the case of low-viscosity
solution, the jet breaks up into the droplets, which cause the formation
of spheres and foamlike structures. The greater the viscosity is,
the more stable is the polymeric jet to be able to travel through
the grounded collector.20 In our previous
work,12 we showed the effect of polymer
concentration and molecular weight on the formation of different polymeric
structures by using the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation
(Table S1). Figure 2 represents the concentration as a function
of the molecular weight of PAN, where the solid line shows the concentration
threshold of PAN polymer where above and on the line, fiber formation
is dominant (see the Supporting Information). On moving toward lower regions, spherical and foamlike structures
start to form. On the other hand, each point in the graph corresponds
to the different PAN concentrations with different molecular weights,
which are selected for the fabrication of fibers, spheres, and foam,
colored red, purple, and blue, respectively. Hence, it is possible
to obtain the structures with the desired morphology and size, such
as spheres,12 foams, and fibers,21 by tailoring the system (e.g., flow rate, applied
voltage, and working distance between the nozzle and collector) and
solution parameters (e.g., polymer concentration).

Figure 2 Entanglement concentration
as a function of the molecular weight
of PAN polymer.

In the first part of
the work, structural morphologies of electrospun/electrosprayed
structures were tailored by controlling polymer molecular weight and
polymer concentration. Three different polymeric solutions with different
concentrations of 1 and 5 wt % and different PAN molecular weights
were prepared to monitor the effect of concentration and viscosity
on the morphology of structures. Table 1 summarizes the synthesis conditions of graphene-based
structures. The results showed that low polymer concentration brought
about the formation of porous interconnected foam. Figure 3a represents the scanning electron
microscope (SEM) image of 1 wt % PAN electrospun foam with an average
pore size of 100 μm. On the other hand, as PAN concentration
increased up to 5 wt %, homogeneous and uniform fibers having an average
diameter of 150 nm were obtained, as seen in Figure 3b. Graphene-based spheres having donut-shaped
structure with an average diameter of 1.6 μm were fabricated
by electrospraying 5 wt % PAN (Mw = 45 000
g/mol), as shown in Figure 3c, and the production details of these spheres have been given
in our previous publication.12 The reason
behind the formation of donut-shaped structure is the combined effects
of low polymer concentration, high intrinsic viscosity, and applied
electric forces at the tip of the syringe during the discharge of
electrospun solution.12 Consequently, it
is possible to convert TEGO sheets into 1D and 3D structures by using
a carrier polymer by tailoring the parameters of applied voltage and
solution viscosity.

2.2 Pt-Decorated 1D and 3D Graphene-Based Structures
Electrospinning/electrospraying technique provides homogenous distribution
of graphene sheets into polymeric matrix by preventing their agglomeration
and restacking under the electric field.12,22 To increase conductivity, Pt particles were integrated into graphene-based
foam, fibers, and spheres during electrospinning and post process.
In the case of foam and fiber structures, Pt nanoparticles were integrated
during electrospraying/electrospinning. Figure 4a shows the SEM image of electrosprayed graphene-based
foam having pores in the size range of microns. It should be noted
that a desirable pore size could be achieved by controlling the polymer
drying time and adjusting solvent vapor pressure.23,24 After the reduction process, the structure still preserved its framework,
as shown in Figure 4b. To improve carbon content, carbonization was applied on the reduced
foam. Figure 4c represents
the SEM image of Pt-decorated 3D graphene-based foam after the carbonization
process. Pt nanoparticles with an average length of 50 nm in cubical
form were distributed homogeneously on the surface of the graphene-based
foam (Figure 4d). The
large diameter of Pt might stem from the growth of Pt nanoparticles
during heat treatment of the foam. According to Sellin et al.,25 Pt grains under inert atmosphere (e.g., argon)
started undergoing reconstruction after 250 °C, resulting in
the grain growth and agglomeration of Pt particles.

Figure 4 SEM images of (a) electrosprayed,
(b) reduced, and (c) carbonized
Pt-decorated graphene-based foam, and (d) transmission electron microscope
(TEM) image of Pt-decorated foam.

Figure 5 shows
the
fabrication steps of Pt-decorated graphene-based fibers. Graphene
sheets and Pt nanoparticles were integrated into the PAN solution
with a polymer concentration of 5 wt %, wherein higher concentration
of PAN polymer resulted in the formation of homogeneous fibers with
an average diameter of 100 nm. Figure 5a shows the SEM image of graphene-based fibers. After
the reduction process, well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles appeared on
the surface of fibers, as shown in Figure 5b, where the diameter of reduced fibers increased
up to 250 nm due to the growth of Pt nanoparticles all over the surface
of fibers. Figure 5c represents the SEM image of carbonized graphene-based fibers having
leaflike structure owing to the expansion of graphene and the growth
of Pt during carbonization. As seen in Figure 6a, after applying the heat treatment, Pt
particles with the average size of 45 nm had grown and graphene layers
were exfoliated on the surface of carbonized fibers. The large diameter
of Pt particles, as discussed above, is due to the Pt agglomeration
during the carbonization process. In this structure, Pt catalysts
were on graphene sheets but are not visible clearly in the TEM image
in Figure 6b since
leaflike exfoliation on the fiber surface caused the formation of
wrinkled structures and catalysts were placed under these structures.
Also, it is noticeable that using unpressurized air as core material
during electrospinning leads to the formation of the hollow fibers
shown in Figure S1.

(b) reduced, and (c) carbonized
Pt-decorated graphene-based fibers.

magnifications.

Figure 7 represents
SEM images of graphene-based spheres after electrospraying, carbonization,
and Pt deposition. Graphene spheres with an average diameter of 2.9
μm were fabricated by electrospraying of low-Mw PAN solution containing graphene sheets (Figure 7a). The high intrinsic viscosity
and high electric field of low-Mw PAN
solution during the process are the main parameters that cause the
formation of donut-shaped spheres. After carbonization, graphene-based
spheres shrank to about 75% and the diameter decreased down to 700
nm (Figure 7b).12 The decoration process of Pt nanoparticles was
performed on the carbonized graphene-based spheres, as shown in Figure 7c. Pt nanoparticles
with an average diameter of 4 nm were decorated homogeneously on the
surface of graphene-based spheres, as shown in Figure 7d. The addition of Pt particles after the
carbonization process brought about the formation of smaller Pt particles
rather than foam and fibers since heat treatment accelerates the growth
process of Pt particles.

and (c) carbonized
Pt-decorated graphene-based spheres and (d) TEM image of Pt-decorated
spheres.

Figure 8 represents
the distribution of Pt on the surface of graphene-based foam, fibers,
and spheres. Although Pt was loaded with equal amounts into the structures,
there were variations in the distribution of Pt particles on the surface
of structures coming from the morphological differences of the samples.
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) results confirm that the average Pt
wt % in the sphere structure is 20, whereas in the case of fiber and
foam, this amount decreases down to 5 and 9, respectively. The elemental
mapping results of the samples are given in Figure S2 and Table S2. The Pt particles on the fiber and foam surface
were distributed uniformly, but during heat treatment, the size of
Pt particles increased to 45 and 50 nm, respectively, due to the reconstruction
and agglomeration of particles.25 In the
case of graphene-based spheres, Pt nanoparticles were distributed
densely with a size of a few nanometers.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization
was performed to confirm
the presence of Pt in graphene-based structures. Figure 9 shows the XRD spectrum of
Pt-decorated graphene-based fibers. TEGO shows a characteristic 002
peak at 2θ = 26.5°.12 On the
other hand, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 39, 45.8, and 67°
are attributed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the face-centered
cubic crystal lattice of Pt, respectively.26 The high intensity of Pt characteristic peaks compared to that of
graphene characteristic peak may stem from the low amount of TEGO
in the structure and growth of Pt particles during the heat treatment
process.

process.

Figure 10a exhibits
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of Pt-decorated
neat electrospun, reduced, and carbonized graphene-based fibers. PAN
shows characteristic peaks at 2930, 2250, and 1450 cm–1 belonging to C–H bonds in CH2, nitrile bond (C≡N),
and tensile vibration of CH2, respectively.27 There is a significant decrease in the intensity
of C=O bond at around 1660 cm–1 after hydrazine
reduction, and this proves a successful reduction process and decrease
in oxygen functional groups. After applying heat treatment, no characteristic
peak was observed due to high carbon content in the fiber structure. Figure 10b displays Raman
analysis of TEGO sheets, Pt-decorated fiber, and Pt-decorated graphene-based
fiber. TEGO sheets have three main characteristic peaks at 1338, 1577,
and 2750 cm–1 known as D, G, and 2D peaks, respectively.12 On the other hand, in the Raman spectrum of
Pt-decorated fiber, the presence of D peak at 1342 cm–1 and G peak at 1596 cm–1 is attributed to the disordered
carbon structure and in-plane vibration of sp2 carbon atoms,
respectively.22 The ratio of D and G peak
intensities (ID/IG) is a way to measure the defects in the carbon-based structures.
As ID/IG increases,
sp2 bonds are broken and thus more defects appear in the
structure.28 Pt-Decorated fibers show an ID/IG ratio of 0.93,
whereas by the addition of TEGO to the structure, this value increases
up to 0.98, which indicates the growth of carbon network on graphene
sheets after carbonization. The structural properties of Pt-decorated
graphene-based foam and spheres are given in Figures S3 and S4, respectively.

carbonized Pt-decorated

fibers without graphene, and Pt-decorated graphene-based fibers.

2.3 Investigation
of Electrochemical Performance
of 1D and 3D Electrodes
The electrochemical behavior of Pt-decorated
graphene-based structures with different morphologies was investigated
by standard cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge
technique in a three-electrode cell. The specific capacitance of electrodes
was measured using the following equation 1  where C represents the specific
capacitance (F/g), I is the current (A), m indicates the mass of active materials (g), ϑ is
the potential scan rate (V/s), and ΔV is the
applied voltage window (V). Table 2 gives the summary of CV results of fabricated electrodes
in regard to the dimension of the structures. To understand the dimension
effect of graphene sheets on the electrochemical behavior of electrodes,
CV test of Pt-decorated 2D TEGO sheets was also performed at the initial
stage. The TEGO-based electrode did not show any capacitance behavior
due to its nearly linear CV curve as seen in the CV plot of Pt-decorated
TEGO sheets (Figure S5). Figure 11a exhibits the graphs of specific
capacitance of Pt-decorated graphene-based structures as a function
of scan rates. Capacitance values of spheres, foam, and fibers decreased
gradually as the current rate increased. The specific capacitances
of Pt-decorated graphene-based structures at a scan rate of 1 mV/s
were calculated as 118 F/g for spheres, 54 F/g for foam, and 8 F/g
for fibers. An increase in capacitance values of hybrid electrodes
when compared with neat TEGO-based electrodes stems from the diffusion
of PAN polymer chains through graphene layers during electrospinning
since PAN can serve as a spacer by preventing restacking of sheets
and increase the electron mobility. In addition, Pt-decorated TEGO
showed poor capacitance behavior when it was utilized without use
as a polymer carrier due to the sheet–sheet junctions that
limit the conductivity and thus capacitance.29 Another reason of low capacitance performance is the intercalation
of Pt through layers, and this decreases the catalytic activity of
Pt particles. Afterward, graphene sheets were converted into 1D fibers;
the structure started to show capacitance activity but still has a
low value of about 8 F/g since the electrospinning process buried
Pt particles deeply inside the structure and hence the electrochemical
reaction was not observed effectively.30Figure 11b represents
CV curves of graphene-based fibers at scan rates of 1, 5, 10, 50,
and 100 mV/s, wherein the capacitance value was calculated on the
basis of the lowest scan rate. Pt-Decorated graphene-based foam and
spheres as 3D structures showed enhanced specific capacitance of 54
and 118 F/g, respectively, in comparison with 1D fibers. The CV plots
of Pt-decorated graphene-based foam are shown in Figure 11c. Three-dimensional graphene
structures consist of micro and macro interconnected pores, which
results in a high surface area and fast ion/electron transport channels.31 However, the diameter of Pt nanoparticles is
considerably high, about 50 nm, and thus the electrochemical activity
of Pt-decorated graphene-based foam decreased. Therefore, although
Pt-decorated graphene-based foam has a unique structure, it did not
show better capacitance behavior. In the case of sphere electrode,
Pt particle size decreased down to 5 nm and the structure became more
porous, as seen in the SEM image of Figure 7c, and thus the electrode/electrolyte interface
was improved and catalytic activity increased, as shown in Figure 11d. As a result,
the Pt-decorated graphene sphere electrode exhibited higher capacitance
behavior due to its uniform structure since the morphologies of fiber
and foam become more complex after the carbonization process. Pt-decorated
graphene-based structures at low scan rates showed an approximately
rectangular shape, which is the characteristic of an electric double-layer
capacitor. However, the rectangular shape started to distort on increasing
the scan rate up to 100 mV/s. This is owing to an increase in the
polarization intensity and kinetically limited penetration of the
electrolyte ions into pores of active materials at high scan rates.32

structures

The galvanostatic charge–discharge
measurements were carried
out in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte between 0 and
0.8 V at various current densities ranging from 2 to 10 A/g. The representative
charge–discharge curves of Pt-decorated graphene-based structures
at a current density of 2 A/g are presented in Figure 12a. Pt-Decorated graphene-based structures
showed a nearly triangular shape, which is a behavior of electric
double-layer capacitance electrodes.33 On
the other hand, Pt-decorated graphene-based spheres showed a much
longer discharge time at the same current density when compared with
other structures. This indicates higher specific capacitance, which
is also confirmed by CV results of graphene-based spheres. In practical
electrodes, long-term cycling stability of electrodes is one of the
critical parameters. In the present work, the cycling stability test
was carried out under the current density of 5 A/g for 1000 cycles
of 5 A/g for 1000 cycles of charging−discharging. In Figure 12b, specific capacitance
of Pt-decorated graphene-based spheres decreased about 12% after 1000
cycles of charge–discharge, whereas the values of Pt-decorated
graphene-based foam and fibers decreased 6 and 10%, respectively.
The slight decrease in the cycle stability of spheres stems from a
rapid shrinking of pores of spheres due to their 3D nature, which
results in a decrease in the capacitance as time passes, which is
in agreement with Coulombic efficiency results given in Table S3. Consequently, 1D and 3D graphene-based
structures showed comparably higher cycling stability when compared
with the other reported values in the literature.31,34

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN, Mw: 150 000
g/mol), N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF,
99%), chloroplatinic
acid (H2PtCl6, 8 wt % in H2O), and
hydrazine hydrate (N2H4) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Low-molecular-weight PAN (Mw: 45 000 g/mol) was synthesized through free radical polymerization
method.35 TEGO Grade 2 (thermally exfoliated
graphene oxide) having average number of graphene layers of 27 calculated
from XRD data by using the Debye–Scherer equation and 4% oxygen
content was obtained from Nanografen Co. The characterization results
of TEGO are given in Figure S6.

3.2 Fabrication of Graphene-Based Structures by
Core–Shell Electrospinning
Foam, fiber, and spherelike
graphene-based structures were produced at ambient conditions by using
triaxial electrospinning equipment purchased from Yflow Company. PAN
polymer-contained graphene sheets were used as a shell material in
the proposed structures. In the shell material, 0.02 wt % TEGO based
on the weight of solvent was dispersed in DMF by a probe sonicator
for 20 min to get homogeneous dispersion. The optimum amount of 0.02
wt % TEGO was chosen for the production of electrospun structures,
and the detailed results about the optimization process are given
in our previous paper.12 Two different
polymer concentrations of 1 and 5 wt % PAN with a molecular weight
of Mw = 150 000 g/mol were adjusted
to get foam and fiber structures, respectively. In the case of graphene-based
sphere production, low-molecular-weight PAN polymer (Mw = 45 000 g/mol) was used as 5 wt % PAN in 0.02 wt % TEGO/DMF
mixture.

For the production of graphene-based foam, 1 wt % PAN
solution was electrosprayed with an applied voltage of 18 kV and a
flow rate of 5 μL/min. In the case of fibers, as-prepared 5
wt % PAN solution was electrospun with an applied voltage of 10 kV
and flow rate of 8 μL/min. For the production of graphene-based
spheres, the electric field was adjusted to 13 kV and the flow rate
was kept as 10 μL/min by using 5 wt % low-Mw PAN-based solution. All electrospinning/electrospraying
experiments were performed with a constant working distance of 10
cm, and the core part of the nozzle was kept empty during each process.

3.3 Pt Deposition
In each material, H2PtCl6 was added into the solution to observe 0.05
wt % Pt on the basis of the polymer weight in the final structure.
The amount of Pt was optimized by the addition of two different amounts
of 0.05 and 0.1 wt % Pt in the fiber structure. As can be seen in Figure S7, the high amount loading of 0.1 wt
% results in the serious agglomeration problem on the surface of fibers.
Thus, 0.05 wt % was selected as the optimized amount for the decoration
of Pt on the surface of graphene-based architectures. In the case
of graphene-based foam and fibers, Pt catalyst was dispersed in electrospun
solution and impregnated in the matrix during the electrospinning
process in a one-step process. On the other hand, Pt particles were
dispersed on electrospun graphene spheres after the carbonization
process to improve the capacitance value.

To obtain Pt from
H2PtCI6, hydrazine hydrate was used as a reducing
agent in distilled water (1:100, v/v). Aqueous hydrazine solution
is used as a nonsolvent for PAN polymer to not damage the structure.36 Electrosprayed/electrospun graphene-based foam
and fibers were immersed into hydrazine hydrate solution and kept
for 1 day at room temperature and then washed several times with water
and kept for drying in an oven. After the reduction process, the color
of the materials turned into gray, indicating that Pt ions were reduced
into Pt-metal particles. For graphene-based spheres, the same steps
of reduction were applied after the carbonization process.

3.4 Carbonization Process
Heat treatment
of the produced fibers, spheres, and foam was performed in two steps
to increase the carbon amount in the structure and thus improve electrochemical
properties of the designed electrodes. In the first step, samples
were stabilized by applying the oxidation process by heating up to
300 °C under air for 30 min and thus the structures became more
stable at higher temperature without transition into the melting phase.
In the second step, these samples were heated up to 1000 °C under
argon atmosphere.

3.5 Electrode Preparation and
Their Electrochemical
Tests
Electrochemical performance of the carbonized samples
was evaluated by PARSTAT MC (Princeton Applied Research) under a three-electrode
system in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte using
platinum wire as a counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode
in a typical potential range for aqueous electrolytes of 0–0.8
V. Working electrodes were prepared by dispersing graphene-based materials
in 3 mL of distilled water using a probe sonicator and then 0.5 mL
of Nafion solution (10 wt %) used as a binder was added into the mixture
and stirred for 1 h to get complete wetting. Then, the solution was
dispersed on the Toray carbon film by drop-casting and the electrode
was dried in a 90 °C oven for 2 h.

3.6 Characterization
The morphology of
samples was analyzed by Leo Supra 35VP field emission, TESCAN LYRA3
focused ion beam scanning electron microscope (SEM) and JEOL ARM 200CF
transmission electron microscope (TEM). Elemental analysis of samples
was conducted by using the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzing
system. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out by using
a Bruker AXS advance powder diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation
source. Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the surface characteristics
of samples by using a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman microscopy system
with the laser wavelength of 532 nm at room temperature in the range
of 100–3500 cm–1. The functional groups in
the structures were determined by Netzsch Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR).

4 Conclusions
In the
present work, Pt-decorated graphene-based structures with
different dimensions and morphologies were successfully fabricated
by core–shell electrospraying/electrospinning technology. Graphene
foam was produced by electrospinning for the first time instead of
the chemical vapor deposition technique. PAN polymer was used as a
carrier polymer to improve the carbon network and decrease the sheet–sheet
junction of graphene sheets and thus enhance capacitance values. Pt
was used as a catalyst to improve the catalytic activity of electrodes
during CV analysis. The electric field during electrospraying/electrospinning
enhanced the diffusion of polymer chains through graphene layers and
provided better dispersion by converting graphene sheets into 1D fibers
and 3D foam and spheres. The structural morphology was tailored by
changing the molecular weight of PAN and polymer concentration in
the electrospun solution and adjusting the applied voltage during
electrospinning. The relation between molecular weight of PAN and
polymer concentration on the formation of different structures was
investigated by using the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation,
in which the obtained data was consistent with the experimental results.
Structural properties of 1D and 3D structures were confirmed by FTIR
and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical results showed that neat Pt/TEGO
electrode did not show any capacitance behavior whereas the integration
of TEGO sheets into 1D fibers and 3D foam and spherical structures
in carbon network improved capacitance characteristics. Specifically,
a high capacitance of 118 F/g was obtained from 3D graphene-based
spheres at a scan rate of 1 mV/s due to the homogeneous decoration
of Pt particles with a diameter of 4 nm on the surface after post
treatment. After the carbonization process, foam and fiber structures
lost their uniformity and graphene exfoliation and destruction in
the structure and agglomeration of Pt particles caused their electrochemical
performance to decrease. Therefore, the size and placement of Pt particles
need to be controlled to get higher catalytic activity. After 1000
cycles of charging–discharging, Pt-deposited graphene-based
structures exhibited high cyclic stability and retention of capacitance
due to the deposition of Pt particles into the electrode structure.
Consequently, core–shell electrospinning technology allowed
to adjust the dimension of structures by the embedment of graphene
sheets and agglomeration of graphene sheets was prevented by applying
an electric field to electrospun solutions. This study especially
brings a new insight to the fabrication of high-performance electrode
materials for energy storage devices.
