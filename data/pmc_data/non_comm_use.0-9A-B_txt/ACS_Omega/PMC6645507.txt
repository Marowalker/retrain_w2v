A new highly sensitive
luminescent iridium(III) chemosensor, 1, was designed
and synthesized for tandem detection of fluoride
ions (F–) and aluminum ions (Al3+). This
sensor 1 exhibited obvious luminesce quenching by hydrogen
bond interactions with F–. In addition, the resulting 1-F complex can be further used to detect Al3+ through
a luminesce enhancement. The detection limit (0.02 μM) of 1-F for Al3+ is far lower than the World Health
Organization (7.41 μM) limit for drinking water. Importantly,
chemosensor 1-F could be used to detect and quantify
F– and Al3+ reversibly. This sensor achieved
rapid detection of two ions, which relies on only one probe.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Fluoride
ions (F–) are important in a number
of medical and biological processes. F– plays an
essential role in dental health1 and may
help in preventing osteoporosis.2 However,
overexposure to F– can cause kidney problems and
acute gastric disorders.3 Consequently,
the detection of F– is an important goal for scientists.4 Meanwhile, the extensive use of aluminum in various
industrial activities can cause the release of free aluminum ions
(Al3+) into the biosphere. At high concentrations, Al3+ is a neurotoxin and can cause organ damage, Parkinson’s
disease, or Alzheimer’s disease.5,6 The World Health
Organization has set the permissible level of the Al3+ concentration
in drinking water to be 7.41 μM.

Traditional instrument-based
detection methods for the detection
of F– and/or Al3+ (19F NMR
analysis for F–7 and
absorption spectroscopy8 and inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry9 for Al3+) require expensive instrumentation and/or time-consuming
sample preparation.10 Recently, the development
of rapid and accurate sensitive probes for the monitoring of F–4 and Al3+ ions has received considerable
interest.11

Numerous organic dyes
have been reported for Al3+ detection,
whereas relatively fewer transition metal complex chemosensors for
Al3+ have been described.12−20 Compared with organic dyes, metal complexes are attractive scaffolds
for chemosensors owing to their large Stokes shift and long-lived
luminescence.21−23 In a preliminary investigation, we have reported
a novel iridium(III) complex equipped with o-phenolsalicylimine
(an Al3+ receptor) in the N∧N donor ligand
as an Al3+ chemosensor.24 However,
the synthesis of this iridium(III) complex required a relatively complicated
synthetic route, resulting in a low yield. Therefore, it is worthwhile
to develop transition metal complex chemosensors with a relatively
simple synthetic route and high sensitivity for Al3+ detection.

Developing methods for detection of two ions by only one probe
is meaningful and useful. A tandem F–- and metal
ion-selective sensor has been reported by scientists. However, there
is no investigation found in tandem F––Al3+ monitoring.25−29 In addition, we recently reported a novel iridium(III)-based probe
for the in vitro and in vivo detection of iron(III) and sulfide ions
in a switch “on–off–on” mode.30 Herein, we present a novel luminescent iridium(III)
complex, 1, containing two 2-phenylbenzimidazole (pbim)
C∧N ligands and a dimethylphenanthroline N∧N donor ligand as a tandem F– and Al3+ chemosensor (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Luminescent Iridium(III) Chemosensor 1 for the
Tandem
Detection of F– and Al3+ Ions
The emission parameters of
iridium(III) complexes are sensitive
to both the surrounding environment and the characteristics of their
N∧N and C∧N ligands. Through its
imidazole motif, complex 1 serves as a hydrogen bond
donor with F–, which can deprotonate the N–H
group contributed by the formation of the highly stable HF2– anions. This results in increased photoinduced
electron transfer, thereby quenching the emission in the 1-F complex.31 Subsequently, Al3+ can coordinate to anionic pbim, which results in the change of the
metal-to-ligand charge-transfer state of the complex, causing a substantial
recovery in the emission of 1.32,33 Therefore, this complex can be used as a luminescent chemosensor
in tandem sensing of F– and Al3+.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of Chemosensors
Previous
studies by the Liu group have reported the hydrogen-bonding interaction
of iridium(III) complexes containing an imidazole group with F–, causing a significant change in the emissive characteristics
of the complex.25 In the present work,
four iridium(III) complexes (1–4) with a range
of C∧N and N∧N ligands were tested
for their capability to be quenched by the F– (Figure 1a). Complexes 1 and 2, both containing imidazole motifs in
the C∧N ligands, were significantly quenched by
F– (Figures 1b and S5). The slightly weaker
quenching response of 2 could possibly be due to its
sterically bulky N∧N ligand, which hinders the access
of F– to the acidic proton. On the other hand, complex 3 lacking an imidazole ring and complex 4 bearing
a thiazole ring in place of imidazole both showed minimal response
to F– (Figures 1b and S5). These results
suggest that quenching is associated with interactions at the imidazole
sites. Considering that complex 1 gave the maximum response
(15-fold reduction), we selected 1 as the lead sensor
for F– detection.

Figure 1 (a) Structures of complexes 1–4. (b) Fold change
of complexes 1–4 (10 μM) in the presence
of F– (0.5 mM) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/H2O (9:1, v/v).

2.2 Luminesce Emission Response of 1 toward F–
We initially examined the luminescence
response of 1 to F–. Without F–, 1 displayed strong luminescence intensity
in solvent system DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v). However, when F– was added, the luminescence intensity of 1 was quenched significantly (Figure 2). We next examined the use of other organic solvents
(in combination with 10% H2O), including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile (ACN),
acetone, and ethanol (EtOH). The results showed that DMSO provided
the best probe performance to F– (Figure S6). Moreover, the optimal ratio of DMSO and H2O was determined to be 9:1 (v/v), with higher amounts of H2O leading to a lower quenching response (Figure S7). In emission titration experiments, complex 1 (10 μM) showed gradually reduced luminescence intensity
with increasing concentrations of F–. The luminescence
intensity reached its minimum at 40 molar equiv of F–, with a 15-fold reduction (Figure 2a). A linear relationship (R2 = 0.991) was established from 2 to 10 μM F–, and a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.75 μM was recorded (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) Luminescence spectra
of 1 (10 μM) with increasing
concentration of F– (0–50 molar equiv, sodium
fluoride aqueous solution) in DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v), λex = 300 nm. (b) Relationship between luminescence intensity
and F– concentration.

2.3 Selectivity Studies of Anions to 1
The selectivity of sensor 1 for F– over other potential interfering anions was examined. The luminescence
response of 1 (10 μM) in the presence of 0.4 mM
anions, such as I–, Br–, Cl–, SO42–, S2O32–, NO2–, NO3–, N3–, and SCN–, was recorded (Figure 3). The results showed that only F– led to obvious
changes in luminescence response, whereas the rest of the anions caused
no significant response under the same conditions. To further demonstrate
the specificity of the sensor to F–, we performed
competition studies by adding F– (0.4 mM) to complex 1 (10 μM) in the presence of other anions (0.4 mM).
The result showed no significant change in luminescence emission,
indicating that 1 has the ability to selectively detect
F– even when these other common interfering anions
were present.

to different
anions. The black bars represent the addition of 0.4 mM different
anions to the solution of 1. The red bars represent the
subsequent addition of 0.4 mM F– to the solution,
λex = 300 nm.

2.4 Detection of Al3+ by 1-F
As a tandem detection strategy for both fluoride and aluminum
ions, we then examined the luminescence signal of complex 1-F to Al3+. To achieve this, complex 1-F was
prepared from 10 μM 1 with a 1:40 molar equiv ratio
of 1:F– in solvent system DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v) and the resulting solution was treated with increasing
concentrations of aluminum ions (0.2–5 μM). The luminescence
intensity of 1 went up linearly with the increasing concentrations
of Al3+, with a maximal ca. 15-fold luminescence enhancement
at [Al3+] = 5 μM (Figure 4a). A linear relationship (R2 = 0.999) was established from 0 to 1.4 μM Al3+, and a detection limit of 0.2 μM was recorded (Figure 4b). Interestingly,
0.5 molar equiv of Al3+ was sufficient for full luminescence
recovery, which could be ascribed to Al3+ multicoordination
with 1-F. To verify the tandem interaction among 1, F–, and Al3+, the reactions
were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S8). The pbim (H at 8.01 ppm) proton signal of 1 was downfield-shifted, suggesting the presence of hydrogen
bond interactions. Moreover, the luminescence on–off–on
of sensor 1 in tandem response to F– and Al3+ could be easily visualized by eye under UV illumination
(Figure 5).

Figure 4 (a) Luminescence
spectra of 1-F (10 μM, 1:40
molar equiv ratio) with increasing concentration of Al3+ (0–5.5 μM) in DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v). (b) Relationship
between luminescence intensity and Al3+ concentration,
λex = 300 nm.

Figure 5 Photographs of 10 μM 1 (left), with 40 equiv
of F– (center), and then 0.4 equiv of Al3+ (right) in DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v) under UV illumination.

2.5 Selectivity
Studies of Metal Ions to 1-F
To investigate
the selectivity of this Al3+ detection method, common metal
ions were added into the 1-F mixture in DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v). Upon addition
of 1 equiv of various metal ions to 1 (10
μM), including Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Ba2+, Fe3+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Cr3+, Ca2+, Pb2+, K+, Ag+, Mn2+, and Ce3+, the enhancement
of luminescent response of 1-F was negligible in comparison
to the response for 0.4 equiv of Al3+ (Figure 6). This shows that the probe
has excellent selectivity toward Al3+ (Figure 6). We believe that this is
because Al3+ binds fluoride with great affinity than other
metal cations.34

Figure 6 Luminescence response
of 1-F (10 μM) with 0.4
molar equiv of Al3+ or 1.0 molar equiv of other metal ions
in DMSO/H2O (9:1, v/v), λex = 300 nm.

2.6 Reversibility
of Sensor 1
Finally, we explored the reversibility
of the tandem detection method
for F– and Al3+. Complex 1 (10 μM) was treated with 40 equiv of F–,
which induced luminescence quenching. Five minutes later, the solution
was treated with 0.4 equiv of Al3+, leading to restoration
of luminescence. After luminescence returned to the initial levels,
another 80 equiv of F– was introduced into the mixture
and luminescence of the solution was quenched again. Five minutes
later, the solution was treated with a further 0.8 equiv of Al3+, restoring the luminescence a second time. Continuing in
similar fashion, the on–off cycle could be repeated at least
three times (Figure 7). Furthermore, this hydrogen bond interaction cycle could be reversed
several times without a decrease in the maximum luminescence. This
result suggests that probe 1 can be used for the reversible
tandem measurement of F– and Al3+ in
solution.

Figure 7 Luminescence response of 1 (10 μM) to the sequential
addition of F– (40 equiv for the first time, 80
equiv for others) and Al3+ (0.4 equiv for the first time,
0.4 equiv for others), λex = 300 nm.

3 Conclusions
We have
reported a new luminescent chemosensor, 1,
for tandem F– and Al3+ detection via
hydrogen bond interactions. The results show that the luminescence
of complex 1 can be readily quenched by F–, forming complex 1-F, and upon addition of Al3+, its luminescence can be restored. On the basis of the above results,
a luminescent switch on–off–on tandem sensor for F– and Al3+ was developed. Moreover, 1-F showed a linear response to Al3+ from 0.2 to
1.4 μM and showed an excellent selectivity to Al3+. Moreover, the reversibility of the on–off–on sensor
to tandemly monitor F– and Al3+ was demonstrated.
We anticipate that this probe could be further optimized to generate
an on–off–on sensor that could be used in biological
systems.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 F– and Al3+ Detection
The stock solution
of 2.5 mM complex 1 was prepared
in acetonitrile (ACN). The complex was then added into dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)/water (H2O) (9:1, v/v) to a final concentration
of 10 μM. Different concentrations of F– were
then added to the DMSO/H2O mixture with complex 1 (10 μM) in a cuvette. As for the tandem detection of Al3+, 0.4 mM F– and 10 μM 1 were mixed in DMSO/H2O in a cuvette and then different
concentrations of Al3+ were then added to the solution.
Luminescence emission spectra were recorded on a PTI QM-1 spectrofluorometer
(Photo Technology International, Birmingham, NJ) under ambient temperature,
with the slits for both excitation and emission set at 2.5 nm. UV–vis
absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary UV-300 spectrophotometer
(double beam).

4.2 Synthesis of Complexes 1–4
A solution of the N∧N ligand (0.12 mmol)
and dichloro-bridged [Ir(C∧N)2Cl]2 (0.056 mmol) in dichloromethane (3 mL) and methanol (3 mL)
was stirred at 60 °C overnight. After the reaction completed,
an excess of ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6) solid was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for another
0.5 h at room temperature. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure,
and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent,
methanol/dichloromethane, 1/20, v/v) to yield complexes 1–4.
