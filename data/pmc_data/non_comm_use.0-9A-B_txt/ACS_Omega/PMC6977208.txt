Electrohydrogenation of toluene (TL)
to methylcyclohexane (MCH)
has been recognized as a promising technology for the hydrogenation
process in the organic hydride hydrogen storage system. Recently,
we found that the Ketjenblack (KB)-supported Ru–Ir alloy electrocatalyst
showed a high electrocatalytic activity for the electrohydrogenation
of TL to MCH, and there was the synergy of Ir electrocatalysis for
the formation of adsorbed hydrogen species (Had) (H+ + e– → Had) and Ru catalysis
for hydrogenation of TL (6Had + TL → MCH). In this
paper, the Ir-modified Ru nanoparticle supported on KB (Ir/Ru/KB)
electrocatalyst was synthesized by using a modified spontaneous deposition
method. The method enables to control the surface structure of Ru–Ir
nanoparticles. The Ir/Ru/KB cathode showed higher electrohydrogenation
activity than the Ru−Ir alloy/KB cathodes even at lower loadings
of precious Ir. Characterization studies using a scanning–transmission
electron microscope with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer and
X-ray absorption fine structure proved selective and uniform modification
of Ru nanoparticle with Ir. Cyclic voltammetry measurements in H2SO4 aqueous solution indicated higher electrochemical
active surface areas of Ir at the Ir/Ru/KB electrocatalysts than that
at the Ru–Ir alloy/KB electrocatalysts, which is the reason
for the strong synergy of Ru and Ir for the electrohydrogenation of
TL to MCH.

Introduction
Researches on electrolysis
have attracted great attentions in recent
years as a promising technology to convert renewable energy into chemical
energy, and many studies on water electrolysis,1,2 CO2 electroreduction,3−5 N2 electroreduction,6,7 and so on8−13 are addressed to develop a sustainable society. Electricity derived
from renewable energy can be used directly to operate these electrolyzers.
In addition, the rates of electrochemical reactions would be easily
controlled by the electrolysis current in accordance with the energy
supply situation; therefore, electrolyzers can follow daily and seasonal
fluctuation of renewable energy unlike the conventional thermal reactions.
In recent years, it is known that electrohydrogenation of toluene
(TL) to methylcyclohexane (MCH) is one of the promising technology
as the hydrogenation process in an organic hydride hydrogen storage
system.14−32 Water is oxidized on an anode (eq 1), and TL is reduced to MCH with electrons and protons
on a cathode (eq 2) which
is widely known as a transportable hydrogen carrier.33−36 As presented by eq 3, the theoretical electrolysis voltage of the reaction (1.07 V) is
lower than that of the water electrolysis (1.23 V). Thus, the direct
electrohydrogenation process has significant advantages in energy
conversion efficiency for the hydrogenation of TL to MCH to compare
with a conventional 2-step hydrogenation process, which consists of
the water electrolysis and the catalytic hydrogenation of TL.16 In accordance with the demand of energy, hydrogen
is extracted by a catalytic dehydrogenation of MCH to TL and used
as an energy source.33−36 1   2   3  

To achieve a high efficiency of the energy
conversion for the hydrogenation
process, it is necessary to develop an active electrocatalyst for
the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH which can suppress the side-reaction
on a cathode, that is, hydrogen evolution reaction (eq 4). Cathodes supported Pt with higher
loadings for the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH were widely studied,
and it was reported that 50 wt % Pt/C (TEC10E50E, Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo) and 54 wt % Pt–Ru/C (TEC61E54, Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo)-coated
gas-diffusion layer (GDL) cathodes were active for the reaction.16,26 4  

Recently, we reported that
10 wt % Ru–Ir alloy supported
on Ketjenblack (Ru–Ir alloy/KB) electrocatalysts showed high
electrocatalytic activity for the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH.27,29 The Ru–Ir alloy/KB cathode showed a comparable electrocatalytic
activity to the 50 wt % Pt/KB cathode even at lower loadings of noble
metals. We proposed that the electrohydrogenation of TL on Ru–Ir
alloy proceeded as below; (i) adsorbed hydrogen species (Had) formed on Ir at the surface of Ru–Ir alloy by the electrochemical
reduction of a proton (H+ + e– + Ir →
Had–Ir), (ii) Had on Ir migrated to Ru
surface (Had–Ir + Ru → Ir + Had–Ru), and (iii) Had on Ru reacted with TL adsorbed
on Ru and MCH formed (TLad–nRu
+ 6Had–Ru → MCH + (n + 6)Ru).
Ir and Ru in Ru–Ir alloy worked as an electrocatalyst for Had formation and a catalyst for hydrogenation of TL, respectively.
The high catalytic activity of Ru for the hydrogenation and the high
electrocatalytic activity of Ir for the Had formation synergistically
catalyze the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH. The surface structure
and surface composition of RuIr particle must be critical for the
electrohydrogenation activity; however, it is almost impossible to
control those properties of Ru–Ir alloy independent from the
bulk composition because Ru–Ir alloy is random solid solutions.

The spontaneous deposition is known as a specific adsorption of
metal ions (MAn+) on another
metal surface (MB). It occurs when MB contacts
with MAn+ solution containing
acid electrolyte.37−44 We considered that it could be possible to control the surface structure
of RuIr particles independent from the bulk composition by using the
spontaneous Ir-deposition on Ru nanoparticles. Fundamental studies
on the spontaneous depositions of Ru,38,39 Rh,40 Pd,41 Ir,42 Pt,42,43 and Au44 on precious metal substrates were extensively studied;
however, there were limited works applying the spontaneous deposition
to supported catalysts.45−49 Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there was no work on
the spontaneous Ir-deposition on Ru nanoparticles. In the present
study, we developed Ir-modified Ru nanoparticles supported on KB (Ir/Ru/KB)
electrocatalyst by using a modified spontaneous deposition method.
The addition of acid electrolyte was not necessary in this method.
We found that the Ir/Ru/KB cathode exhibited a superior electrocatalytic
activity toward the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH at lower loadings
of precious Ir than the Ru–Ir alloy/KB cathode. Purposes of
this work are (i) to prove excellent electrocatalytic activity of
the Ir/Ru/KB cathode, (ii) to characterize the structure of the Ir/Ru/KB
electrocatalyst, and (iii) to propose well-designed surface of the
electrocatalyst for the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH.

Result and
Discussion
Electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH
Figure 1 shows effects of Ir loadings
(X) on working cathode potentials and faradic efficiencies
of the MCH formation [FEs(MCH)] in the galvanostatic electrohydrogenation
of TL at 0.20 A cm–2 using the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB (X wt % Ir-modified 10 wt % Ru nanoparticles
supported on KB) cathodes and the Ru(10 – X)–Ir(X) alloy/KB cathodes29 which has been reported previously. For all cathodes, sum
of FE(MCH) and FE(H2) was ∼100%. At an Ir loading
of 0 wt % [i.e., Ru(10)/KB cathode], a high FE(MCH) of 95% was obtained;
however, the working potential was markedly negative as −0.330
V corresponding to a large overpotential of 0.490 V. On the Ru(10
– X)–Ir(X) alloy/KB
cathodes, the working potential shifted positively with the increase
in the Ir loading. The working potential and the FE(MCH) were, respectively,
−0.183 V and 86% at the Ru(5)–Ir(5) alloy/KB cathode.29 The positive shift of the cathode potential
was due to the synergy of Ru and Ir, that was caused by the acceleration
of the electroreduction of H+ to Had species
on Ir. In addition, the working potential at the Ir(10)/KB cathode
was relatively positive (−0.171 V) under the same reaction
conditions, though the FE(MCH) was only 24%.29 In the case of the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB cathodes, the
working potential drastically shifted to positive potentials at Ir
loadings of 0.5 and 1 wt %. The working potential at the Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB
cathode was −0.190 V which was very close to −0.183
V for the Ru(5)–Ir(5) alloy/KB cathode. Furthermore, the FE(MCH)
on the Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB cathode was 94%, which was higher than 86%
on the Ru(5)–Ir(5) alloy/KB cathode. At the Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB
cathode, the working potential was −0.147 V where the overpotential
was only 0.307 V with a high FE(MCH) of 92%. The synergy of Ru and
Ir in the Ir/Ru/KB electrocatalysts was stronger than that in the
Ru–Ir alloy/KB electrocatalysts. Figure S1 shows results of a long-time electrolysis using the Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB
and Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB cathodes. The cathode potentials and FEs(MCH)
were very stable during 10 h electrolysis on the both cathodes. This
indicated the steady activity of Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
cathodes under the electrohydrogenation conditions.

Figure 1 Effects of Ir loadings
on (a) working cathode potentials and (b)
FEs(MCH) under galvanostatic electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH at j = 0.20 A cm–2 on (i) Ir(X)/Ru(10)KB and (ii) Ru(10 – X)–Ir(X) alloy/KB cathodes.

Figure 2 shows effects
of current densities (j) of the galvanostatic hydrogenation
on the working cathode potentials and the FEs(MCH). In spite of a
lower loading of Ir, the working potentials and the FEs(MCH) of the
Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB cathode were very similar to that of the Ru(10)–Ir(5)
alloy/KB cathode at j values of 0.20–0.40
A cm–2. Furthermore, the Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB cathode
showed a higher electrocatalytic activity at 0.40 A cm–2 to compare with the Ru(10)–Ir(5) alloy/KB cathode and the
50 wt % Pt/KB16,26 cathode which was well known
as the active cathode. It is to be noted that the loadings of catalysts
on the GDL were the same as 2.0 mg-catal. cm–2 for
all cathodes; therefore, the sum of metal loadings were 0.27 and 1.00
mg-metals cm–2 on the Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB and 50 wt
% Pt/KB cathodes, respectively. Though the metal loading of the former
was less than one-third of the later, the former was superior. Accordingly,
we have succeeded to develop the stable and effective Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB cathodes for the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH.

(iii) Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB and (iv) Ru(10)–Ir(5) alloy/KB cathodes.

Characterization Studies of Ir/Ru/KB Electrocatalysts
Characterization studies were conducted to reveal structures of
the
Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts. As shown in Figure S2 of transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images, nanoparticles with 1.5–3 nm diameters (2.3 nm
average) were observed on (a) the Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst which
was the base material. The average particle diameters of (b) Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB
and (c) Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts were 3.1 and 2.5 nm, respectively.
These data indicated the modification of Ru with Ir increased the
particle diameters slightly. Figures 3, S3, and S4 show scanning–transmission
electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM–EDS)
images of the Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB, Ru(10)/KB, and Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts,
respectively. In the case of the Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst (Figure S3), Ru nanoparticles were observed. In
the case of Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst (Figure 3a–d), strong signals of Ru were detected
from all particles, and weak Ir signals were detected from the Ru
particles. Any isolated Ir nanoparticles were not detected. Moreover,
a high magnification high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)–STEM
image of one particle (Figure 3e) and the line-scan profiles (Figure 3f) indicated a uniform distribution of Ru
and Ir. These results proved that selective modification of Ru nanoparticle
with Ir was succeeded by the present spontaneous deposition method.
For the Ir(5)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts (Figure S4), much stronger Ir signals were detected from Ru nanoparticles,
and isolated Ir nanoparticles were not observed.

across the positions.

Figure S5 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts. Diffraction lines
were assigned to hcp-structured Ru metal for all patterns. Crystal
structures of Ru did not change before and after the Ir modification. Figure 4a shows Ru K-edge
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra. The Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB (X = 0–5) electrocatalysts
exhibited similar XANES spectra to that of Ru metal as a reference
material; however, the more intense peaks around 22 133 eV
in the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts suggested
a presence of partially oxidized state of Ru. Figures S6 and 4b show k3-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
oscillations and Fourier-transform of k3-weighted EXAFS spectra, respectively. In Figure 4b, peaks at 1.5 and 2.4 Å were mainly
originated from coordination of O and Ru around Ru, respectively.
Curve-fitting results of the EXAFS spectra are indicated in Table 1. The coordination
numbers and the bond lengths of Ru–Ru and Ru–O for the
Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts were almost the
same with regardless of Ir loadings. In addition, the coordination
of Ir around Ru was not observed for all Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalysts. In the case of the Ru(5)–Ir(5) alloy/KB electrocatalysts,
the coordination of Ir around Ru was observed.29 The differences in the coordination clearly indicated the
Ru and Ir structure estimated by EXAFS in the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst so differed from that in the Ru–Ir
alloy/KB electrocatalyst.

Figure 5a shows
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Ru 3p3/2 region at the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts
and reference materials. The spectra of the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalysts were deconvoluted using reference spectra of Ru metal
and RuO2·nH2O materials.
For all spectra of the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts,
oxidized Ru species were observed, which was consistent with the results
of XAFS analysis. No major differences in oxidized states of Ru were
observed regardless of Ir loadings. The oxidized Ru species should
form by contacting with Ir3+ during the spontaneous deposition
process and air after the catalyst preparation. Figure 5b shows XPS spectra of an Ir 4f region at
the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts and reference
materials. The spectra were varied with regard to Ir loadings. The
peak position at the spectrum of Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst was
similar to that of reference spectra of Ir metal, indicating that
the major species of Ir at the Ir(1)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst was
Ir metal. This proved that Ir3+ was reduced and deposited
on the catalyst during the spontaneous deposition process. When the
Ir loadings increased, full widths at half-maximum of Ir 4f peaks
increased. This indicated an increase in the ratio of oxidized Ir
species. The oxidized species should form by the incomplete reduction
of Ir3+ during the spontaneous deposition process. We observed
partial oxidized states of Ru and Ir in the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalysts; however, the oxidized Ru and Ir species should be
electrochemically reduced to the metallic states during the electrohydrogenation
reaction due to the negative working potential. The working states
of Ru and Ir in the electrohydrogenation reaction must be metallic
states.29

The HAADF–STEM and EDS results indicated
uniform and selective
Ir modification of the Ru nanoparticles. The XRD and Ru K-edge EXAFS
results proposed that bulk structures of Ru particles were not affected
by the modification with Ir. Ir should be immobilized only at the
surface of Ru nanoparticles in the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalysts. The XPS results proved that Ir3+ reduced
and deposited on the catalyst surface during the spontaneous deposition
process. The strong synergy of Ru and Ir observed in the electrohydrogenation
of TL using the Ir/Ru/KB cathode should be due to the unique surface
structure of Ir-modified Ru nanoparticles.

Electrochemical Studies
of the Ir/Ru/KB Electrocatalysts
The surface structures of
the Ir-modified Ru nanoparticles at the
Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts were analyzed using
cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The CV in H2SO4 aqueous solution between 0 and 0.8 V (SHE) are shown in Figure 6. We confirmed that
this potential range was suitable because the maximum hydrogen adsorption/desorption
current was observed as shown in Figure S7. At the CV of the Ir(10)/KB electrocatalysts (Figure 6f), a redox couple was observed at 0.0–0.3
V which was attributed to electrochemical adsorption/desorption of
Had (adsorbed hydrogen species) on Ir. On the other hand,
a redox couple of Had was not observed at the Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalyst (Figure 6a). Therefore, the redox couple at 0.0–0.3 V presented in
CVs of Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts (Figure 6b–e) were
electrochemical adsorption/desorption of Had on the Ir
surface at the Ir-modified Ru nanoparticles.29 The charges passed for the oxidation of Had (QH, shaded area in Figure 6) could be converted to the electrochemical
active surface area of Ir (ECSAIr) using a conversion factor
of 179 μC cmIr–2.51,52Figure 7 shows the QH and ECSAIr values per unit amount
of catalyst as a function of Ir loading. Those of Ru–Ir alloy/KB
electrocatalysts are also shown in Figure 7 for comparison.29 The ECSAIr value of the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts
were higher than that of the Ru(10 – X)–Ir(X) alloy/KB electrocatalysts with the same Ir loadings.
These results indicated that the surface area exposed Ir at the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts were more than that at the
Ru(10 – X)–Ir(X) alloy/KB
electrocatalysts. This strongly suggested a surface modification with
Ir on the Ru nanoparticle. Furthermore, the shape of the peaks for
the Had desorption at the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB
electrocatalysts changed as the Ir loadings. This difference reflected
the difference in the surface structure of Ir.29 The Had desorption at more positive potentials
as observed in the CV of the Ir(10)/KB electrocatalyst indicated a
presence of a larger Ir ensemble. When the size of Ir ensemble decreased,
the peak width decreased and the peak potential shifted negatively.
The narrow Had desorption peaks at the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts indicated a small ensemble size of Ir.
Ir dispersed highly on the Ru surface at the Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts.

The Had species on Ru atoms hydrogenated the TL adsorbed
species activated by the Ru surface and MCH formed. The higher ECSAIr value accelerated the formation of Had; as the
result, the Ir/Ru/KB cathode exhibited lower overpotentials for the
electrohydrogenation of TL even at lower loadings of Ir. By tuning
the surface structure of the RuIr nanoparticle, the synergy of Ru
and Ir toward the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH was drastically
enhanced.

Conclusions
We developed the Ir-modified Ru nanoparticle
supported on KB electrocatalysts
using the modified spontaneous deposition method. The Ir/Ru/KB cathode
exhibited the strong synergy of Ru and Ir toward the electrohydrogenation
of TL to MCH even at lower loadings of Ir and superior electrocatalytic
activities to the Ru-Ir alloy/KB cathode previously reported. Characterization
studies revealed that Ir selectively and uniformly immobilized on
the Ru nanoparticles. The CV measurements demonstrated higher ECSAIr values at the Ir/Ru/KB electrocatalysts than that at the
Ru–Ir alloy/KB electrocatalysts, which was the reason for the
stronger synergy toward the electrohydrogenation of TL to MCH. In
other words, the synergy of the Ir electrocatalysis for the electroreduction
of H+ and the Ru catalysis for the catalytic hydrogenation
of TL was effectively performed on the Ir/Ru/KB electrocatalyst. This
work suggests that the controlling surface structure of electrocatalyst,
the specializations of catalysis and their synergy are essential for
realization of other difficult electrochemical reactions.

the Supporting Information.

Catalyst Preparation
Ru Suppoted
on KB (Ru/KB) Electrocatalysts
The Ru/KB
electrocatalyst was prepared as reported in our previous paper.29 A powder of KB (90 mg) and ion-exchanged water
(100 mL) were mixed in a PTFE beaker (200 mL). The suspension was
ultrasonicated to disperse KB in water. Aqueous solutions of RuCl3·nH2O (20 mM, 4.95 mL) was
added to the solutions and heated to 353 K with stirring by a magnetic
spin-bar. Then, aqueous solutions of NaOH were added to adjust at
pH = 12. Aqueous solutions (20 mL) of NaBH4 (37.5 mg) and
NaOH (10 mg) were added dropwise and have been stirred overnight.
This mixture was filtered, washed with ion-exchanged water (100 mL)
and 2-propanol (20 mL), and dried in vacuum at 343 K for 1 h, and
a catalyst powder, denoted as Ru(10)/KB, was obtained, where the number
inside brackets was the mass loading of Ru in preparation (wt %).

Ir-Modified Ru/KB Electrocatalysts
The Ir modification
was conducted using a Personal Organic Synthesizer ChemiStation PPS-2511
(EYELA). The Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst (50 mg) was put into a tube
type reactor (I.D. 26.4 mm, O.D. 30.0 mm, L 200 mm)
and reduced with H2 (101 kPa, 100 mL min–1) at 298 K for 1 h to remove oxidized phase on the surface of Ru
nanoparticles. Subsequently, the gas phase was replaced by Ar (101
kPa, 100 mL min–1), and 10 mL of 0.13–1.3
mM of IrCl3·nH2O aqueous
solutions was added using a syringe without contacting with air. Before
the addition, the IrCl3·nH2O aqueous solution was deoxygenated by bubbling Ar (101 kPa, 50 mL
min–1) for 30 min. The suspensions were stirred
for further 1 h in an Ar flow. During stirring the suspension, the
oxidation of Ru (eq 5) and reduction of Ir3+ (eq 6) should proceed spontaneously43 because the standard redox potentials of eq 5 [i.e., −0.050 V (SHE) for RuOH/Ru
and +0.788 V (SHE) for RuO2/Ru] are more negative than
that of Ir3+/Ir (eq 6). 5   6  

After that, the suspension was filtered,
washed using deionized water and 2-propanol, and dried under vacuum
at 298 K for 1 h. The obtained powder was denoted as a Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalyst, where X is
a mass loading of Ir in preparation (wt %). Actual loadings of Ir
and Ru were confirmed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP–OES) analysis and were almost equal to the
loadings in preparation (see Table S1).

50 wt % Pt/KB Electrocatalyst
An anode electrocatalyst
of KB supported Pt (50 wt %) was prepared by the impregnation method.
Aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.1 M) and the KB support were well mixed by using a magnetic
spin-bar, and the mixtures were dried up on a hot plate at 393 K with
mixing by a glass stick. The precursor powder in a quartz reactor
was reduced in a stream of H2 (101 kPa) at 573 K for 2
h.

Preparation of MEA
Electrode and membrane-electrode
assembly was prepared as follows: an ink of the electrocatalyst was
made from mixtures of electrocatalyst powder (4.0 mg), 10 wt % Nafion-dispersion
(20 μL), and acetone (250 μL). The ink was prepared by
ultrasonicating the mixture for 10 min. The ink was casted on GDL
(SIGRACET GDL-25BC, 2.0 cm2), and the electrocatalyst-ink/GDL
was dried in vacuum at 323 K for 10 min. The electrocatalyst/GDL cathode
has been prepared. Loadings of the electrocatalyst were 2.0 mg-catal.
cm–2 for all cathodes. The anode of 50 wt % Pt/KB/GDL
(5.0 mg-catal cm–2) was prepared by similar procedures. The cathode and the anode were
connected on both sides of the Nafion 117 membrane by hot-pressing
at 413 K and 50 MPa.8 This electrocatalyst/GDL|Nafion
117|Pt/KB/GDL unit as the MEA completed.

Electrohydrogenation of
TL to MCH
The MEA was set in
a two-compartment batch electrolysis cell.27 Pure TL (25 mL) was added to the cathode compartment, and Ar (101
kPa, 20 mL min–1) was flowed. Ion-exchanged water
(15 mL) was soaked to the anode compartment and a pure H2 gas (20 mL min–1) was supplied. We replaced the
water oxidation to the H2 oxidation for the anode reaction;
however, we confirmed that the same results of the cathode potential
and the FE of products were obtained, regardless of the anode reaction.27 An electrode of Ag/AgCl saturated KCl aq [+0.199
V (SHE)] was connected to a Nafion 117 via 0.5 M H2SO4 aq solutions. A pure Ar and pure H2 were, respectively,
supplied to the anode and cathode compartments for 20 min and a galvanostatic
electrolysis was conducted under 0.10–0.40 A cm–2 by the IviumStat.XR (Ivium Technology) for 2 h at 298 K. MCH and
H2, were respectively, analyzed by GC-2025-FID [Shimadzu,
HP-1 capillary column (0.25 mmϕ × 100 m, Agilent Co.)]
and GC-8A-TCD [Shimadzu, active carbon column (3 mmϕ ×
2.5 m)]. The cathode potentials were measured by using the reference
electrode; however, the potentials were denoted against SHE without
an iR-correction. The faradic efficiency to the MCH
formation [FE(MCH)] and cathode potential were employed to evaluate
catalytic activities. The FE is defined as follows: FE = (yield × F × n/Q) × 100%,
where F is the Faraday constant (96 485 C
mol–1), n is the number of electrons involved in
the reaction, and Q is the charge passed.

Characterization
Studies
ICP–OES Analysis
The filtrate after the preparation
of the Ru(10)/KB and Ir(X)/Ru(10)/KB electrocatalysts
was analyzed using the Agilent 5100 VDV ICP-OES instrument. The concentration
of Ru and Ir in the filtrates was determined. Actual loadings of Ru
and Ir in the electrocatalysts were calculated subtracting the amounts
in filtrates from charged amounts.

TEM and STEM Measurement
TEM images were measured using
the JEM-2010F (JEOL, 200 kV). STEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were measured using the JEM-ARM200F-B (JEOL,
200 kV) equipped with dual SDD-type EDS spectrometers.

XRD Measurement
XRD patterns were measured using the
MiniFlex-600 XRD instrument (Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation (40
kV, 15 mA).

XAFS Measurement
Ru K-edge XAFS
spectra were measured
in transmission mode at the beamlines NW10A of Photon Factory Advanced
Ring (PF-AR) of Institute for Materials Structures Science, High Energy
Accelerator Research Organization (KEK-IMSS), Tsukuba, Japan. The
X-ray energy was calibrated using Ru metal (E0 = 22 119.3 eV). XAFS samples were prepared by mixing
the electrocatalyst and BN powders and pressing into a pellet (10
mm diameter). The XANES and EXAFS spectra were analyzed using the
REX2000 software (Rigaku). The backscattering amplitudes and the phase
shifts of Ru–Ru and Ru–O were calculated using the FEFF
program.50

XPS Measurement
The electrocatalyst was mechanically
mixed with Au powder as reference for calibration. XPS spectra were
measured using the JPS-9010MC instrument (JEOL) with Al Kα radiation
(12 kV, 25 mA) and an analyzer pass energy of 30 eV. The binding energy
was calibrated using a Au 4f7/2 peak as 84.0 eV. Spectra
at the Ru 3p3/2 region were analyzed using the linear-combination
fitting with reference spectra of Ru metal and RuO2·nH2O materials. For spectra at the Ir 4f region,
the intensities were normalized by the maximum intensity of respective
spectra.

CV Measurement
CVs were measured
using an H-type cell
divided by a glass filter and the Ivium Stat. XR potentio/galvanostat.
An electrocatalyst ink is made from the electrocatalyst (2.0 mg),
10 wt % Nafion-dispersion (20 μL), and acetone (200 μL)
by ultrasonication. A working electrode was a grassy carbon electrode
(I.D. 5.0 mm, 0.19 mg-catal. cm–2) that casted the
electrocatalyst ink (4.0 μL). The working electrode, a Pt-black/Pt-wire
counter-electrode, and the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were soaked
in H2SO4 aq (0.5 M) solutions of the two compartments,
respectively. The electrolyte solution was deoxygenated by bubbling
Ar for 15 min. CVs were measured between 0.0 and +0.8 V (SHE) with
50 mV s–1 for several cycles until stable CVs were
obtained. The stabilized CVs were reported. The data of CVs were normalized
by a geometric area of GC electrode (0.20 cm2) and electrode
potentials were converted to potentials on the basis of SHE without
an iR-correction.
