The growth into anisotropic one or
two dimensions is important
in plasmonic gold nanomaterials because extinction occurs along multiple
axes and sometimes the resonance extends to the near-infrared region.
The surfactant mixture of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and
Pluronic triblock copolymers has been recently demonstrated to be
efficient anisotropic soft templates for the growth of noble metal
nanomaterials. Seed-mediated growth of two types of anisotropic Au
nanoparticles is achieved in this study. One is one-dimensional prolate-shaped
Au nanoparticles with the average aspect ratios of 2.29 and 2.59,
and the other is two-dimensional gold nanoprisms with the average
edge length of 50.4 nm. These anisotropic structures are believed
to be produced by the tendency of Pluronic copolymers to be micellized
anisotropically at the elevated temperatures and by the preference
for being lamellar mesophases in the phase diagrams when the concentration
is highest. When prepared in the surfactant mixture of CTAB and L-64
(17.9%), Au nanoparticles containing spherical particles (27.9 nm)
as the major products show the best catalytic performances in the
reduction reactions of 4-nitrophenol.

==== Body
Introduction
The shape of plasmonic
metal nanoparticles (NPs) such as gold,
silver, and copper is an important factor to determine the optical
extinction of these materials. Resonance with the specific wavelength
of light occurs on the surface of these NPs, and the shape along with
the size and the surrounding medium determines these plasmon resonance
modes. Gold nanomaterials draw broad interest from nanomedicine to
plasmonics due to their relatively low toxicity and diverse resonance
modes extending to the near-infrared region.1,2 The
synthesis is also active, and designing anisotropic gold NPs can be
assisted using micellar soft templates. Pluronic triblock copolymers
have been known as early as the 1950s and recognized as one of the
most popular polymer surfactants. They are composed of poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO)–poly(propylene oxide) (PPO)–PEO triblocks.
They are biocompatible and accordingly they are used as the cell culture
medium and for many biological purposes such as drug delivery vehicles.3 Pluronic copolymers are easily organized into
amphiphilic micelles with hydrophobic PPO cores surrounded by hydrophilic
PEO coronas.

When another surfactant is added to amphiphilic
copolymers, the
mixture of block copolymers and surfactants tends to form anisotropic
micelles by the strong interaction of charged surfactants on polymer
micellar aggregates.4 In fact, cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB) and Pluronic copolymers are not simply mixed, as the
alkyl chains of CTAB and methyl groups in PPO cores are self-assembled
into hydrophobic cores and the head groups of CTAB are placed in the
interface between PPO cores and PEO coronas.5 The rheological study also proved the easy formation of micellar
self-assembly between CTAB and Pluronics with a sufficiently high
concentration of Pluronics.6 With regard
to the formation of anisotropic soft templates, Pluronic copolymers
are organized into rod-like micelles or cylindrical micelles in hexagonal
symmetry at the elevated temperature.7,8 Due to this
dynamic soft nature of micelles according to the surrounding environment,
Pluronic copolymers can be used in the shape-controlled synthesis
of metal NPs. Seedless preparation of anisotropic Pd nanorods was
achieved at 65 °C in the surfactant mixture of CTAB and Pluronics,9 and a rare synthetic method of Pd@Au core–shell
nanorods was studied in the mixture of CTAB and Pluronics.10 In addition, utilizing the ability of Pluronics
as the metal-coordinating ligands, micron-scale anisotropic rods and
plates were generated by the self-assembly into hexagonal or lamellar
mesophases in the presence of Ag(I).11 A
similar synthetic approach is extended to gold nanomaterials, and
we discovered that prolate-shaped Au NPs were prepared with Pluronic
F-127 (17.9%) and relatively small Au nanoprisms with an edge length
of 50.4 nm were prepared with Pluronic L-64 (35.7%) in the seed-mediated
method. The synthesis was performed at 43 °C, which is not common
in the synthesis of anisotropic gold NPs in aqueous medium. With the
strong temperature sensitivity and with the ability for guiding the
arrested growth within the micelles, the surfactant mixture of CTAB
and Pluronics can serve as soft templates for various particle morphologies.
The relatively pronounced catalytic activity was also seen for these
Au NPs compared to CTAB-coated Au NPs. It is supposed that 4-nitrophenolate
ions are concentrated near the surface of Au NPs, which is assisted
by the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between 4-nitrophenolate
ions and the self-assembled micelles constructed from the surfactant
mixture of CTAB and Pluronics.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 illustrates
the process for the growth of gold nanoprisms and prolate-shaped gold
NPs. In the phase diagram of Pluronics, isotropic spherical micelles
are formed when the concentration is over the critical micelle concentrations,
and with the increase of temperature or concentration of Pluronics,
several lyotropic liquid crystalline phases are observed. Usually
isotropic lamellar mesophases are found next to the spherical micelles,13 and crystalline cubic, hexagonal, and inverse
hexagonal mesophases are observed at elevated temperatures.8,14 When Pluronic F-127 (17.9%) was used, spherical micelles are assumed
to be produced at 43 °C in which hydrophobic PPO cores were surrounded
by the hydrophilic PEO coronas. Hydrophobic micellar cores are known
to contain around 20% of aqueous solution and they are not perfectly
dehydrated.15 Most of Au cations before
the addition of Au seeds are assumed to reside inside the hydrophobic
cores by complexation with ethylene glycol. The growth of prolate-shaped
gold NPs commences within the hydrophobic micellar cores in a seed-mediated
method. With the increase of temperature, the micelles become larger
due to the increase of hydrophobicity and to minimize the structural
instability of micelles, they elongate further to be the prolate ellipsoidal
shape.8 Therefore, NPs with the higher
aspect ratio (2.59) were obtained at 43 °C. In fact, the neutron
scattering study shows that Pluronic micelles prefer to be ellipsoidal
shape to minimize the repulsion between micelles at short distances.16 When Pluronic F-64 (35.7%) was used, layer-by-layer
lamellar mesophases were believed to be produced because the anisotropic
lamellar phases are normally observed when the concentration of Pluronics
is highest.13 Similar to the self-assembly
of individual amphiphiles, the surfactant mixture of CTAB and Pluronic
F-64 (35.7%) develops into the anisotropic soft templates with layer-by-layer
phases, and the growth of gold nanoprisms proceeds in the region of
hydrophobic lamellar layers. The relatively small size of nanoprisms
is due to the size of lamellar micelles.

Scheme 1 Illustration for
the Synthetic Procedures of Gold Nanoprisms and
Prolate-Shaped Gold Nanoparticles
Prolate-shaped gold NPs with the aspect ratio of 2.29
(Au1) were
observed in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 1a,d). They were prepared
in a seed-mediated method at room temperature with Pluronic F-127
(3.0 mL, 17.9%), CTAB (3.0 mL, 0.2 M), HAuCl4·3H2O (0.5 mL, 36 mM), and ascorbic acid (0.65 mL, 0.568 M). Table 1 summarizes the synthetic
conditions for the synthesis of Au nanomaterials in this study. The
average size is 25.6 nm (±3.42) × 57.9 nm (±9.46) (width
× height). Two regions of NPs were examined by their electron
diffraction patterns (Figure 1b,e), and both display the same patterns of two zones of <112>
and <100>, which were shown by rectangle and square red lines,
respectively (Figure 1c,f). These two zones are characteristic of penta-twinned Au nanorods
which are grown in a seed-mediated method.17,18 The structure of seeds are twinned structures, and the twinned seeds
determine the structure of the final product. It is hard to prepare
single crystalline Au nanomaterials, and the twin structures are widely
observed even in 2 nm Au NPs. Another prolate-shaped gold NPs were
prepared similarly, but the growth temperature was 43 °C (Figure 2a,b). The average
size is 27.0 nm (±4.31) × 69.2 nm (±16.0) (width ×
height) with the aspect ratio of 2.59. The large size and the high
aspect ratio are believed to be due to the increase of hydrophobicity
with increasing temperature. The micellar core radius increases with
increasing temperature, and the large size of micelles prefers the
ellipsoidal shape.

Gold
nanoprisms with an average edge length of 50.4 nm (±11.4)
were prepared with Pluronic L-64 (35.7%, Figure 2c,d). The synthesis of nanoprisms was conducted
at 43 °C. Generally, anisotropic gold NPs do not maintain shape
stability and change into spherical shape at elevated temperatures.
Seed-mediated synthesis in the literature, which uses iodide ions
as the shape directing agents, does not produce nanoprisms over 30
°C.19 However, the preference of Pluronic
copolymers for being anisotropic micelles with the increase of temperature
causes the formation of two-dimensional anisotropic plates in this
study. Gold nanoprisms are useful mostly for sensing applications,
and they gain attention these days, as the electrons and holes at
the hot spots are promising for the photothermal effect to increase
local temperatures,20 or as contrast agents
for optical coherence tomography.21 Diverse
methods for the preparation of these platelet Au nanoprisms have been
reported. The classic seed-mediated method using iodide ions produces
gold nanoprisms with the edge length of 98 nm.19 Utilizing the ability of certain halide or metal ions to
adsorb more strongly on certain facets, {111} planes in the case of
nanoprisms, and to inhibit the growth perpendicular to those facets
is the popular method to prepare gold nanoprisms. Organic solvents
of acetonitrile and trioctylamine are also known to produce gold nanoprisms
with an edge length of 28 nm in a seedless method.22 The seed-mediated photochemical method using a halogen
lamp has been reported recently to produce gold nanoprisms with an
edge length of 496 nm.23 In addition, the
seedless method has been adopted using Pluronic copolymers to prepare
macroscale hexagonal and triangular prisms with an edge length of
over 100 nm.24 There are not many studies
of obtaining relatively small size gold nanoprisms in aqueous medium.
The importance of smaller size anisotropic gold nanomaterials is that
it has stronger absorption than scattering in their extinction spectra,25 and if absorption takes place in the near-infrared
region, it has applications in biological studies.

Two superimposed
gold nanoprisms with the same orientation generate
Moiré fringes (Figure 3). Moiré fringes are well observed in the core–shell
noble metal nanomaterials due to the similar face-centered cubic symmetry
and also due to the small difference of cell parameters among them.26 However, Moiré fringes in superimposed
gold nanomaterials are not commonly observed. High electron density
prevents electron beam from penetrating through gold nanomaterials,
and the preference for the faceted shapes due to the twinned structures
also inhibit the correct alignment of NPs. The average edge length
of nanoprisms in this study is 50.4 nm and the thickness is 13 nm.
Moiré fringes in the local region within one Au nanopropeller
was reported,27 but Moiré fringes
of gold nanomaterials by the entire overlap of two nanoprisms such
as in Figure 3 are
rarely seen. There are two types of Moiré fringes in gold nanoprisms
in this study. One is contributed by three lattice planes, which are
composed of all {220} planes (Figure 3a). The other type is contributed by one lattice plane
of (220) (Figure 3c).
The Moiré fringe, as shown in Figure 3a, is rarely observed because it only occurs
when the orientation of two superimposed nanoprisms are the same,
and at the same time when the electron beam of TEM is perpendicular
to the surface {111} planes of nanoprisms. Two nanoprisms are superimposed
with the rotation of 64° (Figure 3b) and in this case, the sizes of two nanoprisms are
different. As shown in Figure 3d, however, the slight rotation of 1.3° produces Moiré
fringes from two nanoprisms with similar sizes.

(a). (c) the TEM image and (d) the simulation of Moiré fringes
in (c).

When Pluronic L-64 (17.9%) was
used, the mixture of spheres, rods,
and prisms was obtained (Au5, Figure 4b). Close examination reveals that faceted particles
contain twin boundaries, but some particles are spherical plates without
twin boundaries. Moiré fringes are also observed by (220) lattice
planes (Figure 4d,e).
Compared to Moiré fringes in nanoprisms in Figure 3c, the distance between the
fringes is exceptionally small (6.7 Å, Figure 4e), which were produced by the rotation of
10.9° of (220) lattice planes. The same experiment as the synthesis
of gold nanoprisms was conducted at the growth temperature of 23 °C
with Pluronic L-64 (17.9%) and the plate NPs such as hexagonal prisms
and triangular prisms were found along with spherical NPs as the major
products (Au6, Figure 4c). The effect of AgNO3 was also investigated by adding
AgNO3 (0.5 mL, 0.400 mM) to the reaction mixture containing
Pluronic L-64 (17.9%) and by conducting the growth at 43 °C.
Irregular shape particles with low symmetry were obtained (Au4, Figure 4a). The average end-to-end
distance along the long axis is 26.1 nm (±4.5), and they are
much smaller than the normal gold nanostars or branched-shape gold
NPs.

For these Au nanomaterials, optical
absorbance was measured in
a standard quartz cuvette with a 1 cm cell path length. In prolate-shaped
gold NPs with the aspect ratio of 2.29 (Au1, Figure 5a, black line), two plasmon resonance modes
are observed with the transverse mode at 529 nm and the longitudinal
mode at 675 nm. The relatively weak longitudinal mode is due to the
small aspect ratio, and the absorbance from spherical shape NPs also
affects stronger absorbance at 529 nm. Usually, the longitudinal modes
are stronger than the transverse modes, therefore anisotropic gold
nanorods with high aspect ratios show intense longitudinal resonances.
In prolate-shaped gold NPs with the aspect ratio of 2.59 (Au2, Figure 5a, red line), a slight
red-shift of the longitudinal mode was observed at 696 nm, whereas
the transverse mode appears at 530 nm. The shoulder peak at 597 nm
derives from the minor mixture of nanoprisms and spherical nanoplates
as is shown in TEM images (Figure 2a,b). Gold nanoprisms with the edge length of 50.4
nm show the absorbance peaks at 538 and 611 nm (Au3, Figure 5b). When the size of gold nanoprisms
is large, longitudinal modes are red-shifted. The small size of gold
nanoprisms in this study is assumed to produce two resonance modes
close to each other. Irregular low symmetric Au NPs show two resonance
peaks at 567 and 680 nm (Au4, Figure 5c). The peak at 567 nm appears due to the transverse
mode across the center of Au NPs and the peak at 680 nm is due to
the longitudinal mode across the long axis of NPs.29 The mixture of prisms, rods, and spheres (Au5 and Au6, Figure 5d) produce peaks
at 530 nm and around 645 nm. The weak peak at 645 nm is due to the
longitudinal modes of platelets.

With these Au NPs as catalysts, reduction reactions of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol were studied in the presence of aqueous NaBH4 solution. This reaction is now a universal catalytic reaction
for evaluating catalytic activities of the newly synthesized metal
NPs in the fastest and easiest way. It is known that without metal
catalysts, aqueous NaBH4 alone cannot reduce 4-nitrophenol.30 The general concepts of the catalytic reduction
reaction of 4-nitrophenol by nanosize metal NPs are summarized in
the recent review.31 Without possessing
good or excellent hydrogen hosting properties, Au catalyzes this reduction
reaction quite efficiently and also differently from Pt, Pd, and Ir.
The formation of the nitroso compound as the intermediate rather than
the direct formation of phenylhydroxylamine is the major difference
in the reaction mechanism between Au and the other metals.32 The catalytic reaction using Au NPs in this
study completes mostly within 5 min (Figure 6). The ratio between the number of moles
of NaBH4 and 4-nitrophenol is 500, which is the same in
the study with CTAB-coated Au NPs33 and
similar to those in other studies. In the case of prolate-shaped Au
NPs as the catalysts, the rate constants of 0.0093 s–1 (Au1, aspect ratio 2.29) and 0.0080 s–1 (Au2,
aspect ratio 2.59) were found (Figure 7, Table 2). The faster rate constant in Au1 is believed due to the smaller
size of Au NPs. In fact, this reduction reaction is sensitive to the
size of the catalysts and also to the surfactants surrounding the
catalysts.34 Relatively large Au nanoprisms
(Au3) show slow reaction kinetics with the rate constant of 0.0060
s–1 and the rate constant of the reaction using
low symmetry Au NPs (Au4) as catalysts is 0.0178 s–1. The faster reaction in Au4 is believed not from the effect of silver,
but it is due to the irregularity of the shape and the smaller size
compared to prolate Au NPs. A strong reducing agent such as NaBH4 causes another homogeneous nucleation of Ag nanoparticles
from AgNO3 and during this process NaBH4 is
consumed and the catalytic reaction is affected with the lower concentration
of NaBH4. Ag NPs prepared in situ during the catalytic
reaction show better catalytic activities than Au, Pd, and Cu NPs.35 Rather than the nature of each metal, the dispersity
from the irregular shapes of Ag NPs affects this catalytic enhancement,
whereas the aggregated states of Au, Pd, and Cu NPs prepared in situ
by NaBH4 show poor catalytic activities.35 In Au5 and Au6, which were prepared in the presence of
CTAB and L-64 (17.9%), fastest catalytic reactions are achieved with
the rate constants of 0.261 and 0.264 s–1, respectively.
The average particle size of spherical Au NPs in Au5 is 31.8 (±3.7)
nm and the average size in Au6 is 27.9 (±3.9) nm. It is not certain
whether the size, or the shape, or the dispersibility of Au5 and Au6
enhances the catalytic activities. The surrounding environment, which
affects the interaction of the 4-hydroxylphenolate ion with metal
surfaces, needs to be considered. Metal NPs surrounded by the surfactant
mixture of CTAB and Pluronics have not been studied for the catalytic
reduction reactions of 4-nitrophenol. The dispersity is also thought
to affect the catalytic activities, as the layered alignment of prolate-shaped
Au NPs provides spatial confinement for Au NPs and 4-nitrophenolate
ions. The normalized rate constant was also calculated by dividing
the rate constant with the number of moles of 4-nitrophenol and is
shown in Table 2. In
the case of Au6, the normalized rate constant is 2.933 × 103 min–1 mmol–1 and it is
quite a high value among Au NPs and other metal NPs prepared in the
chemical method.

For identifying the differential effect between the
surfactant
mixture of CTAB and Pluronics and each surfactant, control experiments
were conducted without adding Au nanomaterials in the catalytic reduction
reactions. Raw 4-nitrophenol in aqueous medium (2.0 mL, 0.27 mM) shows
the absorption peak at 318 nm (Figure 8a), whereas the peak from 4-nitrophenolate ions appears
at 400 nm with the addition of NaBH4 (0.4 mL, 0.675 M, Figure 8b).34 The intensity of the peak at 400 nm hardly decreases with
time, but the reduction reaction commences with the addition of CTAB
(10 μL, 0.2 M, Figure 8c). This is quite strikingly intriguing since not many studies
show the catalytic activities of CTAB toward the reduction reactions
of 4-nitrophenol.99 New CTAB chemicals
from Sigma-Aldrich and from DaeJung Chemicals (Seoul, South Korea)
were tested, and display similar activities toward the reduction reactions.
CTAB alone forms micelles and micellar catalysis was explained by
the change of redox potentials of the substrate on the surface of
CTAB micelles,36 such that the pKa of acids is lowered near CTAB micelles.37 However, it is known that CTAB as the stabilizer
of metal NPs has negative effects on the catalytic activities by the
inhibition of the movement of 4-phenolate ions to the metal surfaces
with its cationic micellar structures.34 For the comparison of the surfactant effect, we prepared CTAB-stabilized
mixture of gold nanospheres and nanorods in a similar method without
adding Pluronics and studied their catalytic activities (Au7, Figure 9). The size of CTAB-stabilized
nanospheres is 27.0 ± 3.6 nm, which is measured in the scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image (Figure 9a) and is comparable to Au5 (31.8 ±
3.7 nm) and Au6 (27.9 ± 3.9 nm). Absorbance spectrum indicates
the major peak of 531 nm and the minor broad peak centered at 826
nm, which is derived from the longitudinal resonance from gold nanorods
(Figure 9b). The rate
constant was obtained from the successive decline of intensity at
400 nm in time-dependent absorption measurements (Figure 9c), and it shows a significant
decrease (k = 0.00167 s–1, Figure 9d) compared to those
of gold NPs prepared in the surfactant mixture of CTAB and Pluronics.
The rate constant of the catalytic reaction with CTAB (0.2 M) alone
is also obtained (k = 0.00105 s–1, Figure 9d) and there
is a slight difference of catalytic activities between CTAB only (10
μL, 0.2 M) and CTAB-coated gold NPs. CTAB alone is readily
organized into micelles, but in the presence of ascorbic acid the
micellar structure is believed to be disrupted by pH change, and the
original micellar catalysis is interrupted. Surfactants affect the
redox potentials of metal NPs and the enhanced catalytic activities
are due to the alteration of the redox potentials of metal NPs by
surfactants.38 It is also known that surfactants
provide additional stability to metal NPs by removing the contaminated
or poisoned metal surfaces after the catalytic reaction.39

and Au7.

In some redox reactions, the inverse
micelles are known to enhance
catalytic activities better than the normal micelles.40 Hydrophobic interactions between the substrate and the
micellar hydrophobic areas of amphiphilic surfactants play the major
roles for catalytic enhancements. The fast catalytic
reactions by Au NPs surrounded by the surfactant
mixture of CTAB and Pluronics in this study are contributed significantly
by the hydrophobic interaction between 4-hydroxylphenolate ions and
the self-assembled hydrophobic region of CTAB and Pluronics. During
this interaction, 4-hydroxylphenolate ions, which are the precursors
after the addition of NaBH4, are concentrated near the
surface of Au NPs. The structure of Pluronic L-64 is EO13PO30EO13, and that of F-127 is EO100PO65EO100. Due to the large hydrophilic coronas
in F-127, 4-hydroxylphenolate ions are hardly in direct contact with
the surface of metal NPs in a short time, and this affects the slower
catalytic reactions in Au1 and Au2.

Conclusions
Prolate-shaped
gold NPs with the aspect ratios of 2.29 and 2.59
and triangular gold nanoprisms with the edge length of 50.4 nm were
prepared in a seed-mediated method using the surfactant mixture of
CTAB and Pluronics. Anisotropic NPs with a higher aspect ratio of
2.59 was prepared at 43 °C, which is extraordinary from the tendency
of gold nanomaterials to be isotropic with the increase of temperature.
In addition, the synthesis of gold nanoprisms with a relatively small
edge length is interesting, as the method described in this study
provides a simple approach without using certain additives or foreign
ions for the preparation of gold nanoprisms in aqueous medium. The
method requires more refinement as the products include other shapes
of gold nanomaterials. However, Au nanomaterials surrounded by the
surfactant mixture of CTAB and Pluronics show pronounced catalytic
effects for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol, in which the best performance
was achieved with 28 nm spherical particles. Considering the diversity
afforded by many different molecular weights of Pluronics, soft templates
generated from CTAB and Pluronics are thought to be applied for the
anisotropic growth of other similar noble metal nanomaterials.

Experimental
Section
Pluronic copolymers and other chemicals were bought
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Optical absorbance spectra were measured using a JASCO V-770 spectrophotometer
with a 1 cm cell path length and with a UV/vis bandwidth of 2.0 nm.
JAC ultrasonic 1505 (150 W, 40 kHz) was used for sonication. TEM images
were obtained with a JEOL JEM 2010FX operating at 200 kV. SEM images
were obtained with a JEOL JSM 6700F with an operating voltage of 5.0
kV.

Preparation of Gold Nanomaterials
The mixture of CTAB
(3.0 mL, 0.2 M) and Pluronic L-64 (3.0 mL, 35.7%) was vortex-mixed
for 15 s, followed by sonication at 30 °C for 10 min. HAuCl4·3H2O (0.5 mL, 0.036 M) was added and the
mixture was vortex-mixed for 15 s, followed by sonication at 30 °C
for 10 min. Ascorbic acid (0.65 mL, 0.568 M) was added and the mixture
was vortex-mixed for 15 s. The seeds were prepared by the literature
method using NaBH4 as the reducing agent.12 The seeds (50 μL) were added to the growth solution
and the mixture was placed in an oven operating at 43 °C for
1 h. Gold nanoprisms (sample name Au3) were collected by centrifugation
at 4000 rpm for 3 min for TEM sample preparation or they were dispersed
as-prepared without centrifugation for the catalytic reactions. The
mixture of prisms, rods, and spheres (sample name Au5) was obtained
when Pluronic L-64 (3.0 mL, 17.9%) was used. Sample Au6 was prepared
similar to Au5, except for the growth temperature at 23 °C instead
of 43 °C. With the other conditions being the same for making
these mixtures, the addition of AgNO3 (0.5 mL, 0.400 mM)
produced low symmetric irregular shape NPs (sample name Au4). When
the other experimental conditions are the same, Pluronic F-127 (17.9%)
instead of Pluronic L-64 produced prolate-shaped gold NPs with the
aspect ratio of 2.59 (±0.584) when the growth was conducted in
the oven at 43 °C (sample name Au2) and those with the aspect
ratio of 2.29 (±0.426) when the growth was conducted at 23 °C
(sample name Au1). For the comparison of the stabilization environment
on the catalytic activities, the CTAB-coated mixture of gold nanospheres
and nanorods (sample name Au7) was prepared with CTAB (6.0 mL, 0.2
M), HAuCl4·3H2O (0.5 mL, 0.036 M), ascorbic
acid (0.65 mL, 0.568 M), and the seeds (50 μL) in a similar
method to Au3. Summarized synthetic conditions for each gold NP is
shown in Table 1.

Catalytic Reduction Reactions of 4-Nitrophenol
The
reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol was performed in the presence
of Au NPs and aqueous NaBH4 solution, and this catalytic
reaction was studied in a standard quartz cell with a path length
of 1 cm. Aqueous NaBH4 solution (0.4 mL, 0.675 M) was added
to aqueous 4-nitrophenol solution (2.0 mL, 0.27 mM). Then, 10 μL
of aqueous Au NPs, which was dispersed in CTAB and Pluronics in the
as-prepared state without centrifugation, was introduced into the
reaction mixture, while the absorption spectra were recorded every
30 s in the range from 250 to 450 nm at 25 °C.
