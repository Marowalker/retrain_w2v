We
developed a novel substrate for the collection of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) emitted from either living or dried plant material
to be analyzed by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). We demonstrated
that this substrate can be utilized to differentiate emissions from
blends of three teas, and to differentiate emissions from healthy
cotton plants versus caterpillar-infested cotton plants. The substrate
we developed can adsorb VOCs in static headspace sampling environments,
and VOCs naturally evaporated from three standards were successfully
identified by our SERS substrate, showing its ability to differentiate
three VOCs and to detect quantitative differences according to collection
times. In addition, volatile profiles from plant materials that were
either qualitatively different among three teas or quantitatively
different in abundance between healthy and infested cotton plants
were confirmed by collections on Super-Q resin for dynamic headspace
and solid-phase microextraction for static headspace sampling, respectively,
followed by gas chromatography to mass spectrometry. Our results indicate
that both qualitative and quantitative differences can also be detected
by our SERS substrate although we find that the detection of quantitative
differences could be improved.

1 Introduction
Volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) are odorant compounds emitted
from plant tissues. VOCs are responsible for the distinct aroma of
certain dried plants, including the tea, Camellia sinensis. Therefore,
VOCs can be used as an indicator of tea quality.1,2 In
addition, the VOCs emitted from live plants play an important ecological
role by attracting predators to the insect herbivores feeding on the
plant.3 Cotton (Gossypium
hirsutum) is an important crop for fiber production
but its productivity has been significantly affected by major pests:
the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii),
cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), and stink bug (Nezara viridula).4,5 Herbivore-induced cotton volatiles can be utilized as a reliable
indicator of insect infestation.6

A popular contemporary method for analyzing VOCs is gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (GC/MS). This type of analysis first requires VOC collection;
there are several collection methods, including (1) indirect extraction
by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber in static headspace,7,8 (2) purge and trap dynamic sampling involving drawing headspace
air through a column packed with different adsorbent resins,8 or (3) direct extraction by distillation.7 Black, green, white, oolong, and pu-erh teas
can be analyzed for quality by their VOC emissions. SPME is the most
widely used technique for the analysis of the VOCs from tea samples,9−13 and the other two methods of dynamic headspace sampling14 and distillation15−17 are also utilized for
some cases in which tea aroma needs to be collected. Cotton plant
VOC emissions induced by insect herbivores are typically analyzed
by dynamic headspace sampling with different adsorbents,18−21 and SPME has also been reported to collect the cotton VOC.22 Regardless of the collection method, GC/MS analysis
is a very time-consuming process, requiring at least 30 min to complete
just one analysis.

To overcome the lack of rapidity in GC/MS,
electronic nose (e-nose)
sensors have been developed.23,24 Dynamic sampling methods
were coupled with an e-nose sensor for analyzing tea aroma. The FOX
4000 from α-MOS was applied to different tea infusions (green,
black, and oolong) to evaluate its performance on the discrimination
of grade level,25,26 and the EOS835 from Sacmi Imola
s.c.a.r.l. was tested with green tea infusions to classify green tea
samples with different storage periods.27 Additionally, the PEN from AIRSENSE Analytics was used to determine
the differences in aroma profile between tea infusion and tea leaves28 and to distinguish different grades of green
tea leaves.29 Likewise, a handheld e-nose
system was developed for black tea aroma detection30 based on the optimized selection of four commercial tin-oxide-based
MOS sensors. Also, a Pd-doped SnO2 film was deposited on an interdigitated
Au electrode and evaluated for its functionality in linalool tea aroma
sensing.31

For e-nose applications
in cotton, Cyranose 320 has been used to
analyze both stink-bug-damaged cotton bolls and the stink bug itself.32−34 In addition to using the commercial sensor, a low-cost portable
e-nose sensor was designed by optimizing carbon black–polymer
composites to detect the VOCs released from stink-bug-damaged cotton
bolls.35 Although the e-nose has reasonable
sensitivity for VOC detection with good rapidity, it requires additional
training specific to the application before analysis and cannot always
detect individual compounds.

Given the shortcomings of the two
methods mentioned above, surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is proposed as a measurement platform to
analyze VOCs due to its specificity, rapidity, and sensitivity. Several
different methods to fabricate SERS substrate have been proposed,
and one of them was to use nanosphere lithography to precisely control
the shape and gap size.36 In addition,
nanoparticle array-based SERS substrate was developed as a cost-effective
method,37 and a layer-by-layer technique
was also involved to obtain a uniform nanoparticle film.38 Based on those fabricated substrates, many sensing
applications have been reported to detect several target analytes,39 and, especially, different VOCs including acetone
and benzene could be successfully detected by SERS techniques.40,41 However, there have apparently been no studies to determine VOC
emissions from live plants by the SERS technique, but the determination
of methyl salicylate VOC relevant to plant defenses was investigated
by Ag-nanoparticle-based SERS and waveguide-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.42,43 Nevertheless, these proposed techniques were not either suitable
for preconcentration of the VOC or cost-effective.

In addition,
a few studies have investigated whether it can discriminate
different tea samples based on unique spectral information. In these
studies, each tea infusion was vigorously mixed with Ag-nanoparticles
or drop-casted on commercial SERS substrate.44,45 However, these methods are not applicable to the analysis of VOCs
emitted from live plants. Therefore, to analyze VOCs from dried teas
and live cotton plants, a detection system that can act as both preconcentrator
and SERS substrate is herein proposed and investigated.

Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have been widely studied
for capturing VOCs, and some studies integrated MOFs with SERS for
the direct detection of VOCs. One MOF, zeolitic imidazolate framework
(ZIF), was grown on the surface of a SERS substrate to preconcentrate
a wide range of toxic VOCs, and detection of VOCs including benzene
and toluene was successfully achieved at the ppm level.46,47 However, it has not been determined whether the film can be effective
for collecting VOCs released from live plants. Tenax-TA, 2,6-diphenyl-p-phenylene
oxide porous polymer, has been widely applied to studies in which
VOCs from botanicals and food need to be effectively collected as
one of the adsorbents in dynamic sampling48,49 and it is easily dissolved in an organic solvent, enhancing its
processability as a film from the dissolved polymer solution.50

In this study, the unique SERS substrate,
Tenax-TA deposited on
a layer of Ag-nanosphere (AgNS), was developed and tested. The three
objectives were to evaluate SERS spectra for multiplex detection of
VOCs given by three different groups of sources: (1) authenticated
VOC standards, (2) three different tea samples, and (3) cotton plants
infested by beet armyworm caterpillars.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of ADS-SERS
Substrate
A transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
(Figure 1a) shows that
transferred AgNSs
(TAgNSs) of about 100 nm in diameter were formed from many Ag-nanocrystals
less than 10 nm in diameter, and they had an adsorption peak at around
450 nm (Figure 1b),
making them suitable as a SERS substrate.

Figure 1 (a) TEM image of TAgNSs,
(b) UV–vis absorption spectrum
of TAgNSs, and (c) fabrication of adsorbent-coated SERS (ADS-SERS)
substrate and comparison between water-dispersible AgNS (WAgNS)-based
substrate and TAgNS-based substrate.

A unique feature in our developed SERS substrate was the combination
of the adsorbent polymer layer for VOC preconcentration with the SERS
layer (Figure 1c).
When the TAgNSs were used as the material for the first layer, the
adsorbent layer formed very well on top due to hydrophobic interactions
between the phenyl group of the adsorbent polymer and the hydrocarbon
tail of the added surfactant of the TAgNS.

When the TAgNS-based
substrate was compared with the WAgNS-based
substrate, differences included polymer solution contact angle on
the solid film and quality of adhesion. With WAgNS, the polymer solution
contact angle was higher, and the adhesion quality was poor. However,
with TAgNS, the adsorbent polymer layer was formed uniformly on a
relatively larger area of the film, and great adhesion was observed,
possibly due to the substantial work of adhesion from hydrophobic
interactions.51,52 The differences are related to
the interfacial phenomena between TAgNS solid film and adsorbent polymer
in liquid and can also be explained by two well-known equations regarding
interfacial energy53 1   2  where θ is the contact angle (deg), Wa is the work of adhesion, and γ is the
surface energy (J/m2). d represents the nonpolar dispersion
part, p represents the polar part, s represents the AgNS solid film,
and l represents the polymer in liquid.

From these equations,
both contact angle and work of adhesion between
two surfaces could be determined by nonpolar and polar molecular interactions.
The polar term can be ignored in our case due to the strongly nonpolar
property of the polymer. Therefore, only the nonpolar dispersion term
needs to be considered, and TAgNS with a higher nonpolar portion than
WAgNS can result in larger surface energy in the nonpolar term, which
eventually causes larger values of cos θ (small contact
angle) and Wa.

2.2 Determination
of VOC Standards
The
SERS spectrum from each VOC adsorbed on the polymer was compared according
to the collection times in Figure 2a, and, notably, the multiplex detection of three VOCs
could be achieved even at 3 h of collection time. However, any spectral
signature induced from three VOCs could not be found at 1 h of collection,
which was exactly the same as the spectrum from our prepared substrate
itself, meaning that the amount of the VOCs adsorbed on the substrate
was not enough to induce any peak.

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of SERS spectra from the
VOCs evaporated three standards
according to the three different collection times, and (b) principal
component analysis (PCA) plot based on SERS spectra.

The identified wavenumbers are summarized in Table 1, and the spectra from both
linalool and
methyl salicylate were more pronounced than those of cis-3-hexen-1-ol. The vapor from three droplets of VOC standards was
generated by their vapor pressures at 25 °C and could be assumed
to reach saturation at a certain time. Based on the ideal gas law,
the maximum concentration for each volatile could be approximated
(Supporting 1), and the actual concentration
should be lower than the maximum until the vapor becomes saturated.
This idea is supported by the fact that the peak intensity for the
identified wavenumbers was more pronounced as the collection time
increased and the maximum could be reached after overnight saturation.
Quantitative differences between collection times were confirmed by
PCA (Figure 2b), and
all replicates from the 1 h collection were clearly separated from
those from 3 h and overnight collection. In addition, the data for
3 h were closely located to those for overnight, showing that most
of the VOCs could be saturated within 3 h and could be effectively
preconcentrated on the ADS-SERS substrate.

molecular group that can
affect these wavenumber regions.

The maximum concentration for methyl salicylate was the lowest
among the three compounds (Table S1). However,
many wavenumber peaks induced by methyl salicylate were observable
in the SERS spectra. This fact could be explained in that Tenax-TA
adsorbent was more effective for the preconcentration of the VOCs
with lower polarity and higher boiling point.54,55 Although cis-3-hexen-1-ol or linalool was first
attached on the adsorbent, it may have been displaced by methyl salicylate
due to its phenyl group having higher affinity to the adsorbent. As
shown in Figure 2a,
methyl salicylate VOC evaporated from the standard for overnight had
a very intense peak at the wavenumber of 812 cm–1, which corresponded to the approximated concentration, 45 ppm. Considering
that the Raman intensity is proportional to the concentration, our
substrate might be suitable for the detection of any VOC with a lower
polarity like methyl salicylate at the sub-ppm level.

A few
studies have developed a sensor to identify the VOCs used
in our experiment but they focused on a single VOC rather than combined
detection of multiple VOCs. For instance, a quartz crystal microbalance
(QCM) sensor coated with an adsorbent layer such as poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) or maltodextrin (MDEX) was proposed to identify the
linalool or methyl salicylate from black tea.56,57 However, this type of sensor could not detect two VOCs simultaneously.
In addition, the SERS technique, in which the AgNPs were modified
with a specific linkage molecule, was specifically designed only for
the detection of methyl salicylate.42 However,
it was tested with methyl salicylate in the liquid phase, not the
gas phase, and might not be effective for molecules other than methyl
salicylate.

2.3 Determination of Tea Aroma
Major
compounds identified through GC/MS analysis of tea were qualitatively
different for each sample (Table 2). Easily noticeable is a higher proportion of phthalate
ester in the black tea sample, a compound known as a carcinogenic
material that can directly affect human health. Other reports have
detected phthalate ester in tea samples contaminated by environmental
sources or plastic,58,59 so our finding could be a result
of contamination in the black tea samples. Many different terpenes
were detected from the Earl Grey tea samples; both linalool and linalool
oxides are important terpene derivatives that can contribute to tea
flavor and aroma.1,2 Finally, several VOCs including
acetoin and butyric acid were identified from rooibos tea samples,
and they also have been previously reported as volatile components
from rooibos tea.60,61

Raman spectra of the VOCs identified by GC/MS were
investigated
using commercial libraries, and possible matching with the SERS spectra
from each tea (Figure 3) was summarized (Table 1). From the SERS spectra of black tea samples, several intense
peaks were observed at three wavenumber regions of 1072, 1452, and
1496 cm–1, and three phthalate esters from black
tea may be the main components affecting those peaks. As commercial
libraries of any phthalate ester were not available, an additional
function in KnowItAll software aided the selection of molecular groups
based on the peak locations (Figure S1).
An aromatic component with ortho-disubstituted was suggested as a
possible candidate (Figure S1a); its Raman
peaks have been identified at regions similar to those from black
tea and are associated with several vibrational modes of aromatic
ring bending–stretching62 and C–H
in-plane H bending. The general structure of phthalate is that of
an ortho-disubstituted aromatic compound, so several phthalate esters
from black tea may strongly affect these three wavenumbers. A previous
article regarding the detection of the phthalate ester in plastics
by Raman showed that two characteristic peaks were found at 1450 and
1040 cm–1, which could support our result.63 The other two intense peaks were also shown
at the wavenumbers of 1144 and 1268 cm–1, and any
secondary or tertiary alcohol that can result in two wavenumber regions
by C–O–H deformation and C–C–O stretching
is suggested in Figure S1b. Therefore,
two alcohols in Table 2, 2-hydroxyisobutyric acid for tertiary and 3-penten-2-ol for secondary,
might be also possible VOCs affecting these two wavenumbers. A strong
and broad peak was found in the SERS spectra from Earl Grey tea at
the 1620 cm–1 wavenumber, and it is associated with
the mode of bending–stretching by the aromatic ring of p-cymene.64 Two small peaks between
900 and 800 cm–1 corresponded to the spectra from p-cymene and β-pinene. In the case of rooibos tea,
no significant peak was observed relative to the other two teas, but
two small peaks were found at 768 cm–1 corresponding
to acetoin and 856 cm–1 related to butyric acid.

Two multivariate analyses
with the identified wavenumbers showed
great discrimination among the three tea samples (Figure 4). From the data for a 3 h
collection, one replicate for black tea did not separate well from
rooibos but all of the data points were clearly separated for each
tea after overnight collection due to increased intensities at the
identified wavenumbers. In addition to PCA, the classification accuracy
for the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model is summarized in Table 3, averaged from 10
replicates. The overnight experiment provided nearly perfect classification
(100% accuracy), while the 3 h experiment resulted in an 87% accuracy.

2.4 Determination of Caterpillar-Induced Cotton
VOCs
The SPME collections from healthy and infested cotton
plants revealed qualitative and quantitative differences in VOC emissions
(Figure 5). (E)-2-Hexenal, (E)-2-hexenyl acetate, caryophyllene,
humulene, and isoamyl acetate were detected in emissions from caterpillar-infested
plants but not from healthy plants. The most abundant VOC was α-pinene
in both healthy and infested plants. The t-tests
(α = 0.05) revealed that all compounds, shared between healthy
and infested samples, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and the
monoterpenes, were significantly more abundant from infested plants,
except for sabinene (α-pinene: P = 0.004; β-pinene: P = 0.006; limonene: P = 0.050; ocimene: P = 0.027; phellandrene: P = 0.031; sabinene: P = 0.128; and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate: P = 0.027).

Figure 5 Comparison of the identified VOC abundances by SPME–GC/MS
between healthy and infested cotton.

Some wavenumber regions (Figure 6a) that could differentiate between healthy and infested
cotton plants were identified and most of them were located between
1750 and 1550 cm–1. First, 1620 cm–1 was clearly identified only in infested cotton but the specific
VOC responsible was not determined. A possible VOC affecting the peak
at that wavenumber is caryophyllene, with a characteristic peak at
1630 cm–1.65 The peak
shift of more than 10 cm–1 can be explained by the
geometric orientation of the adsorbed molecule to the surface of the
SERS substrate.66 Second, two other peaks
were also shown at 1744 and 1584 cm–1 only in the
infested case and these fairly closely correspond to the main characteristic
peak of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate or (E)-2-hexenyl acetate and phellandrene, respectively. Third, a peak
at 1604 cm–1 was detected in healthy and infested
cotton, so a shared compound could be responsible, possibly ocimene,
with a weak band at that wavenumber. Finally, two other peaks were
also observed at 828 and 672 cm–1 only in the infested
case, and they may be associated with the vibrational property caused
by α-pinene. Although the peak intensities for all of the identified
VOCs that could differentiate between the two treatments were not
high, the PCA plot in Figure 6b showed clear discrimination such that all biological replicates
from healthy cotton were located along the negative component 1 axis,
but those from infested cotton were located along the positive axis.
In addition, the PCA in Figure 6c also showed reasonable discrimination such that most of
the technical replicates from the infested cotton were likely to be
positioned along the positive axis, but those from the healthy were
likely to be positioned along the negative axis.

spectra of the VOCs given off from healthy
and infested cotton plants. (b, c) PCA plot based on cotton VOC SERS
spectra based on 3 biological replicates and 12 technical replicates.

3 Conclusions
A simple
and cost-effective SERS substrate was developed to determine
the VOCs given off by dried teas and live cotton plants. Three tests
were successfully used to demonstrate this SERS substrate’s
ability for simultaneous qualitative detection of multiple VOCs. We
also found the potential for quantification because there was a large
intensity difference associated with VOC collection times. Based on
the fact that our substrate had higher sensitivity to some VOCs including
methyl salicylate, phthalate ester, and p-cymene,
the substrate could be considered as a useful sensing platform for
detecting any VOCs having an aromatic group. To the best of our knowledge,
our study is the first to report direct SERS sensing of VOCs emitted
from either a live plant or a food source. Future studies will include
the optimization of the SERS substrate to maximize VOC quantification
and its application to other types of samples.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Material Description
VOC standards
including linalool, cis-3-hexen-ol, and methyl salicylate
and Tenax-TA (60/80 mesh) adsorbent from Sigma-Aldrich were used.
Three different tea samples including black tea, Earl Grey, and rooibos
tea were commercially available products, and they were directly used
as experimental materials without pretreatment.

4.2 ADS-SERS Substrate
The fabrication
of ADS-SERS substrate was composed of three steps: (1) the fabrication
of WAgNS,67,68 (2) phase transfer of the AgNS to organic
solvent, and (3) adsorbent polymer deposition on the TAgNS film. The
phase transfer of the AgNS was performed with some modifications to
our previous methodology,69 and the fabrication
of ADS-SERS substrate is introduced here. To fabricate AgNS, exactly
0.5 g of AgNO3, 10 mL of deionized (DI) water, 0.8 g of
sodium oleate, 1 mL of oleic acid, and 5 mL of ethanol were mixed
together in a glass vial under agitation. The vial was sealed and
heated overnight at 150 °C. A layer of Ag-nanocrystal formed
at the bottom of the vial, 80 mg of which was dissolved in 20 mL of
cyclohexane. Exactly 560 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate was dissolved
in 100 mL of DI water, and the two solutions were mixed together.
AgNSs were finally prepared by sonicating the mixture for 1 h and
heating it at 70 °C until the cyclohexane was almost completely
evaporated. For the phase transfer of the AgNS, tetraoctylammonium
bromide cationic surfactant solution was prepared by dissolving it
in 0.14 M dichloromethane, and 100 μL of the surfactant solution
was mixed with 100 μL of the AgNS solution. Then, the mixture
was vortexed for 1 min, and the TAgNSs were concentrated by centrifugation
and redispersion with dichloromethane. To fabricate the ADS-SERS substrate,
Tenax-TA polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mg/mL) for the
adsorbent solution, and a 5 μL volume of the TAgNS solution
was first drop-cast on the cleaned quartz substrate and fully dried.
Thereafter, 5 μL of the adsorbent solution was also deposited
on the spot where the TAgNSs were first coated and again fully dried.

4.3 Cotton and Caterpillar Herbivory
Cotton
seeds (Phytogen 367) were planted in 8.5 cm × 8.5 cm
× 8.5 cm plastic pots filled with a store-bought potting soil
(SunGro Metro Mix 900) and arranged in trays. We added water to the
trays as needed and fertilized plants biweekly with Botanicare CNS17
at a rate of 10 mL fertilizer per liter of water. Plants were reared
in Percival environmental chambers on a 14:10 h light/dark cycle at
29:25 °C until the seventh true leaf was fully expanded and the
first square (flower bud) was developing. We wrapped the pots in an
aluminum foil closed around the base of the plant stalk to minimize
the emissions of soil-borne volatiles in close proximity to the SERS
substrate. On the outside of the foil, we incorporated a plastic mesh
to facilitate the crawling of the caterpillars back up to the leaves
after falling off, which they often did at the beginning of the experiment
when being placed on the plants.

The insects, S. exigua larvae, were purchased as eggs from Benzon
Research and reared on an artificial diet of Helicoverpa zea purchased
from Southland Products Incorporated and supplemented with a 7 mL
of raw linseed oil per batch of diet. Insect-rearing conditions were
light/dark for 14:10 h at 28:25 °C. Insects were reared until
the third instar on their artificial diet and then transferred into
glass Petri dishes with excised leaves of conventional (nongenetically
modified) cotton. They were allowed to feed on the conventional cotton
leaves for at least 24 h before being used in experiments. This acclimated
the larvae to feeding on plant material so that they would readily
accept the leaves as food during the experiments.

4.4 VOC Collection by ADS-SERS Substrate
The prepared ADS-SERS
substrate was finally used for the preconcentration
of VOCs from various sources in the static headspace sampling setup
(Scheme 1), and the
size of the chamber varied depending on what kinds of samples were
prepared as VOC sources. The VOC collection started immediately right
after the samples were placed in the chamber.

Samples, and (c) Cotton Caterpillar
4.4.1 VOC Standards
Three 5 μL
droplets of linalool, cis-3-hexen-1-ol, and methyl
salicylate were dispensed in a 120 mL jar. The ADS-SERS substrate
was situated against the wall of the jar facing the three droplets
(Scheme 1a). Three
trials were performed with collection times of 1 h, 3 h, and overnight.
As a control, one substrate was kept inside an empty jar. All trials
were replicated 6 times.

4.4.2 Tea Aroma
Exactly
10 g of each
tea sample was placed inside a 120 mL glass jar for 3 h and overnight,
and the ADS-SERS substrate was also located against the wall of the
glass facing the tea sample (Scheme 1b). These experiments were replicated 6 times.

4.4.3 Cotton VOCs
A single plant was
placed inside a chamber. We fashioned a standout of a metal wire,
which hung off the side of the pot and held the ADS-SERS substrate
(Scheme 1c). The substrate
was held with the narrow edge vertical so that droppings from the
caterpillars would not land on the substrate and contaminate the sample.
Experimental conditions were the same as rearing conditions other
than the plants inside the glass chambers with static headspace for
the experiments. Using soft forceps, we placed five total third- and
fourth-instar larvae in one experimental chamber (the other chamber
was herbivore-free), and both chambers were then sealed. The experiments
took place over 48 h with the plants being enclosed and removed midday.
This experiment was replicated 3 times. The size of the chamber was
much larger than the previous glass jar, so VOC collection efficiency
from the chamber might not be better than that from the small-sized
jar. For this reason, four technical replicates were performed per
one biological replicate to improve the collection efficiency.

4.5 VOC Collection by Commercial Adsorbent
4.5.1 Dynamic Sampling for Tea Aroma
Exactly 10 g of each
tea sample was placed inside a 120 mL glass
jar capped with a Teflon lid. Each glass jar was connected to two
glass columns (178 mm length × 6 mm O.D.; Supelco, Bellafonte,
PA) filled with a 5 cm bed of Hayesep Q resin (80/100 mesh; Hayes
Separations, Inc., Bandera, TX): one column was for dynamic VOC collection
and the other was for cleaning the air entering the jar. The VOC dynamic
collection was performed with a diaphragm pump (Thomas Scientific,)
at a rate of 1 L/min for 1 h.

4.5.2 Static
Sampling for Cotton VOCs
Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/divinylbenzene
(DVB)/Carbowax 50/30
μm coating SPME fibers by Supelco (Millipore-Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) were exposed to the static headspace of the chamber during the
final 30 min of the experiment (Scheme 1c).

4.6 Equipment Used
4.6.1 Adsorbent-GC/MS
The VOCs collected
dynamically were eluted from the resin with 500 μL dichloromethane
and analyzed by a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Shimadzu Scientific
Instruments (Oceania) Pty Ltd., Henderson, New Zealand). We used the
Zebron ZB-WAXplus capillary GC column from Phenomenex, which is 30
m in length with an internal diameter of 0.25 mm and a film thickness
of 0.25 μm. The temperature at the injection port with a flow
rate of 1.5 mL/min was 250 °C, and a 1 μL eluate was injected
with a split ratio of 1. The oven temperature program was initiated
at 40 °C and held for 3 min, then was increased to 240 °C
at 5 °C/min and held for 3 min, and then increased to 250 °C
at 40 °C/min to purge the column. Manual injections with the
SPME fibers were performed with a hollow-bore splitless injection
port and a desorption time of 2 min at 230 °C with the total
injection port airflow at 1.5 mL/min. The oven temperature program
was initiated at 60 °C and held for 2 min, increased to 180 °C
at 4 °C/min, then increased to 250 °C at 50 °C/min,
and held for 4 min to purge the column. Identification of VOCs was
based on the comparison of retention times to authentic standards
and mass spectra stored in the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) and Wiley Registry (10th edition).

4.6.2 Raman Spectroscopy
All ADS-SERS
substrates were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (RamanStation 400F,
PerkinElmer, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, U.K.) with a 256 ×
1024 pixel CCD detector and a 785 nm near-infrared laser with 175
mW power. They were placed on the stage of the Raman spectrometer,
and a spectrum was collected with a 2 s exposure time at a spectral
resolution of 4 cm–1 in the Raman shift range of
200–2000 cm–1. The spectra were finally compared
to the VOCs identified by GC/MS using commercial Raman libraries (KnowItAll
Informatics System 2018, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), and all relevant
Raman libraries are included in the Supporting Information. For the VOC that was not identified from either
any reference or the commercial libraries, Raman spectrum from the
VOC was generated from the corresponding standard and included in
the Supporting Information (S3).

4.6.3 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
Approximately
3 μL of the TAgNSs was sampled to the grid
and perfectly dried. The dried sample on the grid was analyzed in
a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at
an acceleration voltage of 100 kV, and morphological images were captured
with a 3k slow-scan CCD camera (model 15C, SIA).

4.6.4 UV/Vis Spectroscopy
A 100 μL
volume of the TAgNS was sampled inside a quartz cuvette, and UV/vis–near-infrared
(NIR) spectra were collected with a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer.

4.7 Statistical Analysis
4.7.1 Descriptive
Statistics
For GC/MS
data generated with SPME, the peak area for each identified VOC was
calculated with the Shimadzu GCMSsolution (version 2.7) package software.
These values were fourth-root-transformed, and VOCs that were shared
in the healthy and infested were individually compared using one-sided t-tests under the hypothesis that abundances are greater
from infested plants.

For Raman data, all spectral information
was exported from the Spectrum (v6.3) software, and the data were
preprocessed by baseline correction and normalization with the bioinformatics
toolbox of MATLAB. The processed data were finally averaged out from
all replicated data.

4.7.2 Multivariate Analysis
All wavenumbers
from Raman data were considered as variables, and optimal sets of
wavenumber variables were selected from all variables based on the
wavenumbers corresponding to identified peaks associated with the
VOCs produced from different sources.

To identify three VOCs
according to the collection time, unique sets of variables determined
based on the wavenumber peaks induced by three VOCs were shown, and
principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in JMP 13 Pro (SAS
Institute Inc.) with the selected variables. Finally, the first two
principal components were plotted to determine whether the replicates
could be clustered according to the collection time.

To determine
tea variety, specific wavenumbers were chosen as a
final variable set from the identified peaks induced by the aromas
of three teas. PCA was also applied to the Raman tea data with this
variable set. The first two principal components were again plotted
to determine how the replicates from the three tea samples could be
clustered. In addition, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was applied
in R software to the same data set to create an LDA classification
model that can predict which tea variety each data point belongs to.
Model accuracy was evaluated by 6-fold cross-validation with custom
R code that divided all of the data into four groups, and each group
included three data points randomly selected from each tea sample.

To detect caterpillar infestation on cotton, variable optimization
was performed by selecting wavenumbers associated with cotton VOCs,
and PCA was run with the selected data set. The first two principal
components were again plotted to determine whether the replicates
from the infested and noninfested cotton samples could be clustered.
