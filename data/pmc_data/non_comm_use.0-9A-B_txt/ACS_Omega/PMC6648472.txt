Polymer nanocomposite-based sensors
were prepared using cellulose
acetate (CA), carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), and manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanorods to detect and to understand the sensing mechanism
of 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor. A sensor with a mass ratio of 1:1.5:3
of MnO2/CNPs/CA as well as MnO2/CA and MnO2/CNP composite and MnO2 sensors were prepared.
The sensor with the three sensing materials combined exhibited an
enhancement of response for 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor, ascribed
to a synergistic effect between MnO2/CNPs/CA. An in situ
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)-combined online LCR meter setup
was used to understand the sensing mechanism of the sensor. The sensing
mechanism involved a deep oxidation decomposition of the analyte to
CO2. This was confirmed from the in situ FTIR-combined
online LCR meter results, where a new distinct CO2 bending
mode IR band was recorded. To optimize the performance of the sensor,
the composites were prepared by varying the amount of metal oxide
added into the composites; sensor A (composition of mass ratio 1:1.5:3),
sensor B (composition of mass ratio 2:1.5:3), and sensor C (composition
of mass ratio 2.5:1.5:3); their compositions are MnO2/CNPs/CA.
The performance of sensor B was higher than that of the other two
sensors. The sensors also show relatively good response–recovery
time. All fabricated sensors were found to have the sensing ability
regenerated after the analyte was removed from the system without
losing its sensing and recovery abilities. The structural and morphological
features of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Raman spectroscopy.

1 Introduction
Volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) are organic chemicals that are
released from environmental pollutions or living organisms at high
vapor pressure.1 There are toxic gases
(like H2S, NO2, CO, SO2, NH3, and O3), flammable gases (H2, CH4, and so forth), and VOCs such as ethanol, acetone, methanol, and
explosive gases.2 VOC detection is very
crucial in various applications and needs to be detected at a very
low concentration (ppm or ppb).3 Some of
these gases can cause lasting health defects. 2-Methylcyclopentanone
is one of the VOCs identified in freesia flower essential oil.4 It is a cyclic ketone that appears as clear,
colorless liquid with a boiling point of about 139 °C.5 Diebold6 reported
that 2-methylcyclopentanone is stable under normal temperature and
pressure but it can cause chemical pneumonitis in the lung if ingested,
and inhalation of the vapor might lead to drowsiness/dizziness. Therefore,
the fabrication of sensitive and user-friendly gas sensors is very
important to monitor 2-methylcyclopentanone concentrations in the
cosmetic industry as well as in environmental applications to protect
the human health.

The increasing demand for the detection of
different vapors and
disease-related VOCs has lead researchers to fabricate a quick, low-cost,
and sensitive gas sensor at room temperature.7,8 However,
understanding the sensing mechanism of the sensor is very important
in improving the performance and development of specific sensors.
Gas sensors developed for room-temperature sensing have advantages
over elevated temperature sensors such as low power consumption and
low ignition risks when detecting flammable or explosive analytes.3 A typical gas sensor contains sensing materials
which can respond to test analytes and a transducer that converts
this change into electrical signals.2,3 The nanostructured
material-based gas sensors are well known to exhibit good sensing
performances.7 Nanostructured metal oxide
semiconductors such as MnO2,8 SnO2,9 ZnO,10 α-Fe2O3,11 and In2O312 have been widely studied for sensing various types of gases because
of their large surface to volume ratio, stability, high sensitivity,
low-cost, and small size.13

MnO2 exists in different polymorphic crystallographic
forms regarded as α, β, γ-, δ-, and λ.14,15 Zhang et al., and Subramanian et al.16,17 reported that
MnO2 has excellent chemical and physical characteristics
at room temperature and is recommended as one of the most stable manganese
oxides. Several methods have been devised to improve the electrical
conductivity of MnO2, such as doping with conductive materials7 like carbons [carbon nanoparticles (CNPs), graphene,
carbon nanotubes, and so forth.] or polymers. However, because of
the high surface area and electric conductivity, CNPs are used extensively
with MnO2 for making composites.18 CNPs are recognized as an important class of carbon because of their
important qualities such as low toxicity, optical and fluorescence
intensity, stability, biocompatibility, and simple synthesis.19 They possess an sp2-conjugated core
with multiple oxygen-containing species enriched with carboxyl and
hydroxyl including aldehyde.20 Different
methods are adopted in synthesizing CNPs such as laser ablation, electrochemical
exfoliation, acidic oxidation, incomplete combustion oxidation, hydrothermal
pyrolysis, and so forth.21 Cellulose acetate
(CA) is an insulating biopolymer that was used instead of conducting
polymers in this study. This is because of its significant properties
like low-cost, availability, good film-forming capability, nontoxicity,
biocompatibility, and biodegradability, but the major drawback is
its high melting point and poor mechanical properties.22,23

The 2-methylcyclopentanone sensors reported in this study
show
a simple impedance response and sensors were fabricated and tested
at room temperature using nanocomposites. Moreover, the in situ Fourier-transform
infrared (FTIR)-combined with online LCR meter used to confirm that
indeed the sensing mechanism of the fabricated sensors is due to the
deep oxidation of the VOCs into CO2 and also the electrical
response is due to the deep oxidation of the analyte. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first report of detection of 2-methylcyclopentanone
vapors using nanocomposites and understanding the sensing mechanism
using the in situ FTIR-online LCR meter.

2 Results
and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of all
the synthesized products
and the corresponding diffractograms are shown in Figure 1. The main peaks corresponding
to 2θ = 12.7°, 18.1°, 25.7°, 28.8°, 37.4°,
41.9° 49.8°, 56.3°, 60.2°, and 65.0°, correspond
to crystal planes of the MnO2 nanorods (NRs) (110), (200),
(220), (310), (211), (301), (141), (600), (251), and (002)14 (reference code: 01-081-1947c and cross-reference
ICSD: 073363). The characteristic diffraction peaks of CA appeared
near 2θ = 8°, 17°, and 21°.24 The two broad peaks (002) and (101) observed in CNPs can
be attributed to the presence of amorphous carbon and graphitic structures
present in CNPs25 (ICDD: 04-018-7559, LPF:
1933772). All CNPs and MnO2 peaks correspond to hexagonal
and tetragonal crystal systems. No diffraction peaks of CNPs and CA
were seen in the nanocomposite peaks, the reason could be that the
intense peaks from MnO2 NRs, shifted or suppressed CNPs
and CA peaks. The Debye–Scherrer equation was used to estimate
the crystalline size of MnO2 NRs 1  where Dp is the average
crystal size, λ
is the X-ray wavelength (λ = 0.1540 nm) for Cu Kα, K = 0.89, θ is the Bragg’s angle (12.6°),
and β is the full width at half-maximum using (110). The average
crystalline size of MnO2 NRs in the composite was estimated
to be 15.7 nm.

Figure 1 XRD patterns for all the samples.

Figure 2 presents
the Raman spectra obtained to examine the structural characteristics
of the prepared samples. The structural and graphitic nature in CNPs
is shown in Figure 2a. The Raman spectrum depicts a very strong D mode at 1356 cm–1 and the G band located at 1583 cm–1. These peaks can be correlated to the presence of defects and cluster
of graphitic nature in carbon in CNPs. The ratio of D and G (ID/IG) band was estimated
to be 0.85. The spectrum for the CA is shown in Figure 2b. The characteristic Raman peaks for CA
were observed at 2940 and 1139 cm–1 which corresponded
with C–H and C–O stretch glycosidic linkage, respectively.
The characteristic peaks observed at 1737, 1439, and 1377 cm–1 can be associated with C=O, C=C and −C–H
bond respectively. The strong absorption peaks at 658, 915, 1083 and
1257 cm–1 can be attributed to C–Cl, =C–H,
−C–H and C–O respectively.26 The Raman spectrum for MnO2 NRs was depicted
in Figure 2c. The broad
peak located at 643 cm–1 is associated with the
MnO5 octahedral in α-MnO2 NRs while the
peaks at 354 and 175 cm–1 correspond with the metal–oxygen
chain distortion mode of Mn–O–Mn in the octahedral MnO2 lattice.27 The Raman spectrum
for the nanocomposite as shown in Figure 2d showed few peaks. This could be due to
shift or overlap in the composite.

MnO2 NRs, and
(d) MnO2/CNPs/CA composite.

Figure 3 shows
the
surface morphologies for CA, CNPs, MnO2 NRs, and MnO2/CNPs/CA nanocomposites that was examined using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM). The image of CA is shown in Figure 3a. It was observed that CA has fibre-like
structures that are densely packed with the relatively rough surface.
As shown in Figure 3b, the MnO2 morphology appears like NRs with a diameter
between 1 and 2.5 μm. The SEM image in Figure 3c revealed the degree of the corrugation
of CNPs. It was observed that the CNPs were aggregated and interconnected
to each other. The morphology of the MnO2/CNPs/CA composite
is depicted in Figure 3d, showing the CNPs and MnO2 wrapped in CA bulk. Comparing
the two images, the morphology of CNPs changed tremendously after
the formation of the composite.

Figure 3 SEM micrographs of (a) CA, (b) CNPs (c)
MnO2 NRs, and
(d) MnO2/CNPs/CA nanocomposites.

The morphologies of the as-prepared samples and the nanocomposite
were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown
in Figure 4. As observed
in Figure 4a, when
viewed at a higher magnification, CA appeared like an adhesive sheetlike
structure. From the image, it seems that CA has a binding capacity.
As observed in Figure 4b, the CNPs were aggregated in structure and appeared like spherical
chain-linked nanoparticles. The diameter of the CNPs was between 30
and 55 nm. As confirmed by TEM presented in Figure 4c, the morphologies of the MnO2 NRs consist of long rod nanostructures with diameters ranging between
21 and 58 nm. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis in Figure 4d showed that the
as-synthesized MnO2 NRs are composed of Mn, O, and K elements.
Peaks of Cu and C are from the copper grid on which the sample was
deposited while Fe is one of the components that cannot be avoided
when using TEM. From high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) in Figure 4e, the planar spacings of 0.31
and 0.48 nm correspond to (301) and (200), respectively. The TEM image
of the nanocomposite in Figure 4f revealed that CA formed an adhesive layer that binds MnO2 NRs and CNPs to avoid aggregation. We also observed that
MnO2, CNPs, and CA are well dispersed in the composite,
which was very crucial to improve electrical conductivity.

2.1 Application of the Synthesized Materials in
the Detection of 2-Methylcyclopentanone
The active materials
for fabricated sensors were a metal oxide, CNPs, and a biopolymer,
in this case, CA, and variable mass ratios were mixed in 10 mL of
dimethylformamide. Although, we tried another biopolymer such as chitosan,
the noise to signal ratio was very high. The mixture (10 μL)
was drop-cast on the gold-plated interdigitated electrode. After the
cast, the active material was left to dry at room temperature and
then subjected to vacuum to completely remove the organic solvent
from the active materials. It can be seen from the image (see Figure 5) that the film of
the sensing material almost homogeneously covers the electrode. Three
sets of sensors were prepared, each sensor prepared in duplicate,
by varying the mass ratio of MnO2 in the polymer composites
to study the effect of metal oxide in the detection of organic analytes,
in terms of response, sensitivity, and recovery time. During the study,
we used a minimum of 22.0 ppm and maximum of 112.5 ppm of the analyte
vapor at a time. All the sensor performances were conducted at room
temperature, atmospheric pressure, and 42% relative humidity.

2.2 Sensor Performance
In addition to
the sensor containing the three sensing materials, MnO2/CNPs/CA with mass ratio 2.5:1.5:3, we prepared two sensors by mixing
each of the two sensing materials: sensor D (MnO2/CNPs,
mass ratio of 1:1.5), sensor E (MnO2/CA, mass ratio of
1: 3), and sensor F (MnO2 NRs only). Because the three
sensors were fabricated by mixing MnO2, CNPs, and CA at
different ratios, it is important to identify which combination of
the components was responsible for the sensing of the analyte. Interestingly,
the relative impedance response of sensor D and E was very low as
compared to sensor C (see Figures 6 and 7). For sensor F, the relative
response showed a slight decrease as the analyte concentration increases.
The response for the sensor C is very high and increases as the concentration
of the analyte vapor increases with a linear relationship. The sensors
never reached a plateau or saturation value. This might be because
of the analyte that has a high boiling point and low vapor pressure
(5.8 mm/Hg @ 25.00 °C).

Figure 6 Comparisons of real-time impedance sensor response
curves of sensor
C to various control sensor curves.

Figure 7 Relative responses for A = MnO2/CNPs/CA (sensor C),
B = MnO2, C = MnO2/CNPs, and D = MnO2/CA at 45 ppm of 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor.

A comparison (see Figure 7) reveals that the sensor based on the three sensing
materials
(MnO2/CNPs/CA) is 2.5 times more responsive than the sensor
based on MnO2 only, 15 times more responsive than the sensor
based on only MnO2/CNPs, and over 200 times more responsive
than the sensor based on MnO2/CA. This indicates that incorporating
the three sensing materials in a sensor leads to an enhancement of
response for 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor sensing, which should be
ascribed to a synergistic effect between MnO2/CNPs/CA.

The widely accepted interpretation of the gas-sensing mechanism
of n-type semiconductor metal oxides, such as MnO2,33 SnO2,7 ZnO,8 α-Fe2O3,9 and In2O3,10 is the adsorption and desorption of surface
oxygen species. As the oxygen molecules adsorb on the bare surface
of n-type semiconductor metal oxides, it captures charge carriers
to form chemisorbed oxygen species (O2–, O22–, and O2–).
A depletion region is created on the surface of the semiconductor
metal oxide as a consequence of the charge capture.29 Interestingly, when the analyte vapor molecules interact
with surface oxygen species, it results in induced sorption from the
surface, which facilitates injection of captured electrons back to
n-type semiconductor metal oxides and the resistance of the n-type
of semiconductors decreases. The amount of the adsorbed oxygen species
also determines the response characteristics; a large amount of oxygen
adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor metal oxide would facilitate
more reactions on the surface. Interestingly, because the synthesized
MnO2 is an n-type semiconductor metal oxide,28 after being incorporated with CNPs and CA the
interaction with a reducing vapor (2-methylcyclopentanone), one would
expect the resistance (and impedance) to decrease during sensing.
However, we observed impedance as increase in all cases. This indicates
that the composite containing the three active materials behaves like
showing p-type conductivity.29

Generally,
the behavior of the p-type conductivity is first due
to the coverage of the surface of the sensing materials with oxygen
chemisorbed from the atmosphere. The oxygen molecules that adsorb
on the sensing materials capture electrons and ionize into oxygen
species (O–), resulting in the formation of a hole-accumulation
layer.30−33 When the sensing materials are exposed to a reductive gas (such
as 2-methylcyclopentanone gas), the analyte gas reacts with the surface
oxygen species, as a consequence of the electron transfer from the
reacting analyte vapor to the sensing materials. The electrons that
are injected into the sensing materials recombine with the holes;
this leads to a reduction of the concentration of the charge carriers
and increasing resistance of the sensing materials.

It is common
to observe that n-type sensing materials behave like
p-type ones and vice versa during sensing. Such changes can be promoted
either because of changes in temperature or in concentration. Hao
et al.34 reported that n-type sensing materials
changed to p-type at high temperatures. The reason is that at low
temperatures, the adsorbed oxygen species are O2– species. However, at high temperatures, O– and
O2– species coexist and these oxygen species can
capture more electrons than those at low temperatures. Similarly,
Xue et al.35 observed temperature-dependent
sensing behavior for Pt@SnO2 NR sensing materials. At low
temperatures, they observed an abnormal p-type conductivity. However,
the expected n-type conductivity was observed at a high temperature
of 300 °C; however, this unusual p-type behavior was explained
because of Pt-catalyzed morphological changes of ion-sorbed oxygen.
As such, an abnormal observation was not only due to the temperature
change but also due to change in concentration of the analyte vapor.
A study by Siciliano et al.32 indicated
that depending on the concentration of the analyte, the sensing materials
change from n-type at low concentrations to p-type conductivity at
high concentrations.

Moreover, like the metal oxides, all types
of oxygen species do
exist on carbon nanomaterials surfaces, except 2O2–.36,37 A study by Atamny et al.38 revealed that particularly on defect sites or
at edges, below 873 K, carbonaceous materials convert O2 molecules to electrophilic oxygen species, O– (oxides),
O2– (superoxides), and O22– (peroxides). These are electron-deficient species
with a tendency to attack the electron-rich regions of hydrocarbon
molecules and form degradation products.39 The existence of oxygen species (O– or O2–) on the sensing materials leads to the formation of an inversion
layer near the surface that contributes to the p-type sensing response.
The sensing mechanism involves total oxidation to carbon dioxide and
water. The proposed reactions of oxygen molecules with 2-methylcyclopentanone
are described as follows (eqs 2–5).40 2   3   4   5  

2.3 In Situ FTIR-Combined Online LCR Meter Measurement
To confirm the sensing mechanism whether it involved deep oxidation,
we set up an in situ FTIR-LCR meter while a freshly prepared sensor
exposed to the analyte vapor (see the sensor setup in Figure 14). The FTIR spectra were taken
every 2 min for 16 min and we did focus on specific IR bands that
can give us an insight into the sensing mechanism: vibrational modes
that are not saturated during the measurement and do not overlap other
IR bands.

The in situ FTIR results indicate that a new distinct
IR band was detected. The IR band at 668 cm–1 is
assigned to the CO2 bending mode,41,42 the CO2 bending mode intensity increases as the analyte
molecules were exposed to the sensor (see Figure 8 inset) The CO2 IR band is the
result of deep oxidation of the 2-methylcyclopentanone on the surface
of the sensing materials and then desorption of the carbon dioxide
gas molecule from the surface of the sensors. At the same time, the
electrical response of the sensor was recorded using an LCR meter.
As the exposure time increased, the intensity of the CO2 peaks increases with the electrical response. At time t ≈ 0 min, no intensity of the CO2 peaks was detected.
The ΔZ, impedance variation, increased from
the low value to the highest value in less than 1 min and become stable
until the experiment was terminated (see Figure 9). The increase in ΔZ is clearly an indication and therefore, it confirms that the sensor
sensing mechanism involves deep oxidation of the exposed analyte molecules,
which release CO2 gas molecules.

range.

sensor response due
to the exposure of about 110 ppm of analyte vapor.

2.4 MnO2 Concentration
Effect on the
Performance of the Sensors
To optimize the performance of
the sensor, three sensors prepared by varying the amount of metal
oxide added into the MnO2/CNPs/CA composites were exposed
to 2-methyl-cyclopentanone vapor; sensor G (mass ratio 1:1.5:3), sensor
H (mass ratio 2:1.5:3), and sensor I (mass ratio 2.5:1.5:3).

After the injection of the analyte, all the sensors, sensor G, sensor
H, and sensor I, responded very well, increasing the relative impedance
variation (ΔZ) response linearly as the analyte
vapor concentration increases (Figure 10). All the three sensors retained their
sensing ability after the analyte vapor was removed from the chamber.
This trend was observed repeatedly.

Figure 10 Sensitivity of the sensor G, H, and I
toward the 2-methylcyclopentanone
vapor.

The sensitivity of the fabricated
sensors was determined by taking
the derivative of the sensor response [dΔZ/(d[A])]
with respect to the analyte concentration [A], that is, the linear
coefficient of the fitted curve of each sensor. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 11, sensor G has very low sensitivity,
about 3 mΩ ppm–1. Sensor H, however, showed
relatively high sensitivity toward the 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor
with 40 mΩ ppm–1 and sensor I displayed 20
mΩ ppm–1. The relative comparative sensitivity
of sensor H is about 15 times more sensitive than sensor G and twice
more sensitive than sensor I.

time for sensors I using
45 ppm of the analyte.

2.5 Response–Recovery
Time and Stability
of the Sensor
The response and recovery times belong to the
most important parameters of any sensors; they determine how fast
the sensor responds in the presence analyte vapor and how fast it
can recover back to the baseline (after exposure to the analyte is
terminated). Therefore, response time was referred as the time for
the sensor to achieve 90% of the maximum response (saturation) after
the injection of the test gas and; the time for the sensor to recover
90% of the response after the test gas is removed is the recovery
time (see Figure 11). Accordingly, generally, the response and recovery times of the
three sensors were similar and there was no correlation between the
amount of MnO2 in the active material composition and either
the response time or recovery time. The fastest response time of 4.3
min and the recovery time of 1.8 min were recorded for sensor H (see Table 1), which is also the
sensor with higher sensitivity. Consequently, this sensor is also
suitable for application in sensor arrays used to overcome the absence
of sensor specificity to analytes43,44 when discrimination
of 2-methylcyclopentanone is aimed.

The stability of the sensor
was determined on a newly prepared sensor I toward 45 ppm of the analyte
vapor concentration. As shown in Figure 12, the stability test was conducted over
five cycles; after five cycles, the sensor maintained the original
sensing ability without losing sensitivity.

3 Conclusions
Sensors
based on binary or ternary composites of MnO2, CNPs and
CA responded very well when exposed to a variation in
the concentration of 2-methylcyclopentanone vapor in a closed chamber.
The use of all the three sensing materials in the active sensor material
composite leads to an enhancement of response for 2-methylcyclopentanone
vapor, which should be ascribed to a synergistic effect among MnO2, CNPs, and CA. This was confirmed by preparing three sensors
as a control, and by combining each of the two components [MnO2/CNPs (sensor D), and MnO2/CA (sensor E)]. The
impedance response of sensor D and sensor E was very low as compared
to the sensor C. The in situ FTIR-combined online LCR meter confirmed
that the sensing mechanism involved a deep oxidation decomposition
of the analyte molecules to CO2 and H2O. In
terms of the sensitivity and response and recovery time, sensor B
displayed higher sensitivity and faster response and recovery. All
fabricated sensors regenerated the sensing ability after the analyte
was removed from the system without losing sensitivity.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemical
In this
study, all the chemicals
were used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (South Africa). Candlesticks
(Lighthouse Candles) used to obtain CNPs were purchased from the local
shop in Johannesburg, South Africa.

4.2 Collection
of CNPs
The CNPs, also
known as carbon quantum dots, were synthesized for this study by following
a very simple method.21 The CNPs were collected
by combustion of candlesticks with a crucible placed on top of the
candle to trap the CNPs formed on the surface during several hours.
After enough material has been collected for the experiments, a clean
spatula was used to scrape CNPs out from the crucible, purified in
ethanol using a centrifuge, and after drying at 60 °C, the sample
was stored in a vial.

4.3 Synthesis of MnO2NRs
The
synthesis of MnO2 NRs was performed via the reactive-template
method as reported by Zhang et al.,45 with
minor modification. In a typical synthesis, 0.6 g of KMnO4 and 0.25 g of MnSO4·H2O were dissolved
in 40 mL of deionized water. The solution was sonicated for 20 min
and stirred for 5 min to form a homogeneous solution. The mixture
was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.
Hydrothermal treatment was carried out at 160 °C for 12 h. After
reacting, the autoclave was naturally cooled down to room temperature.
Dark brownish precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed
with deionized water and ethanol several times to remove impurities.
Finally, the solid product was dried at 65 °C for 24 h.

4.4 Methodology
Three composites were
prepared by weighing 10, 20, and 25 mg of MnO2 NR powder
in three different solutions containing CNPs (15 mg) and CA (30 mg)
dissolved in 10 mL of dimethylformamide to obtain composites of MnO2/CNPs/CA. Another three composites with MnO2/CNPs,
MnO2/CA, and MnO2 NRs were also prepared to
use as controls. All the six prepared nanocomposites were sonicated
for 15 min and then stirred continuously for 48 h to obtain uniform
solutions. Then, approximately 10 μL of each composite was deposited
onto six different gold-plated interdigitated electrodes composed
of 0.1 mm width and 0.1 mm gap between metal lines of 18 pairs of
7.9 mm length.46 The three sensors containing
10, 20, and 25 mg of MnO2 NRs were labeled sensor A, B,
and C, while the control sensors containing MnO2/CNPs,
MnO2/CA, and MnO2 were labeled sensor D, E,
and F, respectively. The sensors were left to dry at room temperature
and kept under moderate vacuum for few days prior to use.

4.5 Electrical Characterization of the Sensor
The gas-sensing
system setup was constructed by connecting an ISO-TECH
LCR meter (LCR 831, 20 Hz–200 kHz) to the computer system (see Figure 13). The LCR meter,
computer, and diaphragm vacuum pump were connected to the power supply.
The sensors were placed into the sealed 20 L round bottle to interact
with the vapor. The sensors work as transducers by converting chemical
interaction with the sensor active material into an electrical signal
which was measured by the LCR meter. When the exposure time of the
sensor, which was for 15 min, elapsed the analyte vapor was removed
by vacuuming using a diaphragm pump for 5 min at atmospheric pressure.
The sensor was then left to recover for 3 min. This process was repeated
by injecting 22.5, 45, 67.5, 90, and 112 ppm of the analyte vapor.
The concentration of 2-methylcyclopentanone was calculated in ppm
using the following equation.47 6  where C is the vapor concentration
required, ρ is the density of the liquid (g mL–1), T is the temperature (K), Vs is the volume of the liquid analyte (μL), M is the molecular weight of the liquid analyte (g mol–1), and V is the volume of the test chamber (L).
All experiments were carried out at room temperature. The obtained
data were measured and recorded using alternating current (ac) voltage
with an amplitude of 0.5 V and a suitable frequency of 25 kHz.48 The impedance responses of the modified nanocomposite-based
sensors were investigated using a sweep rate of 7.4 points per second.
ac was used to avoid a continuous drift of electrically active impurities
of the active sensor layer and potential electrode deterioration.
The impedance variation was used as sensor response because we applied
a constant frequency of 25 kHz (in which the noise is negligible)
and impedance is then the simplest quantity to be measured because
it is the quotient between applied potential and measured current.
The use of the impedance avoids the need for an LCR meter or impedance
analyzer to determine the resistance and capacitance separately, simplifying
the use of sensors in field applications because impedance can be
determined using simple circuits.49,50 If necessary,
it can be determined with help of a simple portable multimeter in
case of practical measurements outside of the laboratory.

4.6 In Situ
FTIR-Online LCR Meter Setup and Testing
IR spectra were recorded
using the FTIR instrument (PerkinElmer
Spectrum 100) with a resolution of 4 cm–1, taking
an average of 16 successively collected scans. A cylindrical gas cell
(approx. 110 mL volume) fitted with two KBr windows at both ends.
The cell was placed at the center in such a way that the IR beam passes
through the windows. The inserted sensor is positioned to the upper
wall of the cell. The sensor was connected to the LCR meter through
two electrically insulated wires (see Figure 14). During the measurement,
the sensor was exposed to approximately 110 ppm 2-methylcyclopentanone
vapor and the cell was kept in a closed system so that no leaks are
experienced until the measurement is completed. Both the FTIR instrument
and LCR meter were started concomitantly. FTIR spectra were taken
every 2 min, while the impedance measurements were taken continuously
for each sensor to a total maximum time of 16 min.

combined online in situ FTIR and
LCR meter setup and testing.

5 Characterization Techniques
The crystalline
phases of all the prepared samples were characterized
by using XRD (PANalytical X’pert, Netherlands) with Cu Kα
radiation operated at a current of 40 mA and a voltage of 40 kV in
2θ range 10°–90°. Raman analyses were carried
out on using an alpha 300R (WITec) confocal laser Raman microscope
configured with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (wavelength 532 nm).
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area was measured
by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms in Micromeritics
ASAP 2020. The samples were degassed for 12 h at 100 °C before
analysis. The morphologies of the samples were investigated using
TEM (JOEL-2010, 200 kV, HRTEM 200 V) with the samples deposited on
coated copper grids and SEM (TESCAN Vega TC using VEGA 3 TESCAN XMU).
