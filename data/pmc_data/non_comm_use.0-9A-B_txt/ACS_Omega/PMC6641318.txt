SnS2 is
an emerging candidate for an electrode material
because of the considerable interlayer spaces in its crystal structures
and the large surface area. SnS2 as a photocatalyst and
in lithium ion batteries has been reported. On the other hand, there
are only a few reports of their supercapacitor applications. In this
study, sheetlike SnS2 (SL-SnS2), flowerlike
SnS2 (FL-SnS2), and ellipsoid-like SnS2 (EL-SnS2) were fabricated via a facile solvothermal route
using different types of solvents. The results suggested that the
FL-SnS2 exhibited better capacitive performance than the
SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2, which means that the morphology
has a significant effect on the electrochemical reaction. The FL-SnS2 displayed higher supercapacitor performance with a high capacity
of approximately ∼431.82 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.
The remarkable electrochemical performance of the FL-SnS2 could be attributed to the large specific surface area and better
average pore size. These results suggest that a suitable solvent is
appropriate for the large-scale construction of SnS2 with
different morphologies and also has huge potential in the practical
applications of high-performance supercapacitors.

1 Introduction
The
urgent demand for high energy density and power density and
supportable energy sources has prompted research into novel storage
devices. At the same time, the increasing demand for portable devices
has increased the urgency to find storage devices that are capable
and safe for storing energy. Therefore, the emergence of supercapacitors
has changed the situation to some degree. Because supercapacitors
or electrochemical supercapacitors have properties, such as rapid
charging/discharging time, high power density, and long life, these
types of energy devices are used widely.1−7 Electrochemical supercapacitors can be classified as electric double-layer
capacitors (EDLC) or pseudocapacitors based on their energy storage
mechanism. Carbon materials work based on the double-layer mechanism
and store energy by accumulating charge at the interface between the
electrode and the electrolyte.8 On the
other hand, metal oxides/hydroxide materials work mainly on the faradic
mechanism, storing energy by reversible oxidation and reduction reactions
on the electrode material surface.9 In
recent years, the electrodes of supercapacitors have not been limited
to carbon-based materials, transition-metal oxides, conducting polymers,
and hydroxides. Transition-metal sulfides, which are a fascinating
class of electrode material, such as tin sulfide, tin disulfide, tungsten
disulfide, copper sulfide, and nickel sulfide, have been studied extensively
for potential energy storage applications.9−11 Zhang et al.
described a simple in situ growth procedure that produced a three-dimensional
(3D) interconnected copper sulfide nanowall, which showed a high performance
at a current density of 15 mA/cm2.12 The improved electrochemical performance may be dependent on the
high conductivity and large surface area. Li et al. reported the synthesis
of grasslike Ni3S2 nanorod/nanowire arrays by
precisely regulating the degree of oxidation of the NF precursor,
achieving a high specific capacitance of 4.52 F/cm2 at
1.25 mA/cm2 and showing superior cycling stability.13 Chauhan et al. reported that the tin sulfide
nanorod exhibited a specific capacitance of approximately 70 F/g.14 This showed that the specific surface area is
a critical parameter to determine the specific capacitance of these
materials.15 The results show that the
special morphological structure of the material is a remarkable advantage.

Moreover, SnS2 has been reported to have outstanding
properties for applications in photocatalysis, electrochemical capacitors
and batteries, but its applications in supercapacitors have been limited
by its structural instability and lower specific capacitance.16,17 Only a few results have been reported for supercapacitor materials
based on SnS2 electrodes.18 Ma
et al. reported a molybdenum-doped few-layered SnS2 morphology
synthesized by a hydrothermal method and established the improved
electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of ∼220
F/g and good cycling stability.16 Wang
et al. examined the role of SnS2/MoS2 heterostructures
in enhancing the supercapacitive performance and reported a specific
capacitance of ∼105.7 F/g at a current density of ∼2.350
A/g with good cycling stability after 1000 cycles (∼90.40%).
These studies included composite materials and hybrid materials of
SnS2 rather than pure SnS2. In the present case,
different nanostructured SnS2 materials were synthesized
with a better pore size and high surface area, showing better capacitance
than the hybrid materials reported elsewhere.11,14,18

SnS2 was synthesized with
different morphologies using
a one-step solvothermal method, and its electrochemical capacitor
performance was investigated. The nanosheet-assembled flowerlike SnS2 (FL-SnS2) reached approximately ∼431.82
F/g at a current load of 1 A/g, which is higher than those of sheetlike
SnS2 (SL-SnS2) (∼390.38 F/g) and ellipsoid-like
SnS2 (EL-SnS2) (∼117.72 F/g). Because
of the unique morphological structure of the nanosheet-assembled FL-SnS2, the surface area of the FL-SnS2 (∼64.8
m2/g) was higher than those of the SL-SnS2 (∼27.4
m2/g) and EL-SnS2 (∼32.9 m2/g), which exhibited remarkable advantages, including rich available
electroactive sites and sufficient transmission channels. The FL-SnS2 exhibited better electrochemical performance because of these
advantages.

2 Results and Discussion
Nanostructured
materials, having attractive and interesting characteristics,
can be synthesized using hydrothermal or solvothermal methods. In
the present case, tin chloride was treated solvothermally with thioacetamide
(TAA) and the resulting powdered morphology was analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Figures 1 and S1 show the
low-magnification SEM images indicating the formation of FL-SnS2 with highly uniform and homogeneous microspheres, ∼2–4
μm in diameter (Figure 1a,b). On the other hand, the high-magnification SEM image
showed that each SnS2 is made by the self-assembly of ultrathin
vertically grown connected nanopetals, which leads to the formation
of a hierarchical 3D SnS2 nanostructure (Figures 1c and S1a). The SnS2 synthesized using acetone as a solvent
had a two-dimensional (2D) sheetlike morphology, which was ∼100–200
nm in width and ∼20–30 nm in thickness (Figures 1d−f and S1b). In contrast, the SnS2 synthesized
using water as a solvent showed irregular ellipsoidal shapes of a
SnS2 nanostructure with diameters ranging from ∼10
to ∼15 nm (Figures 1g−i and S1c).

of SnS2 with different solvents: (a−c)
FL-SnS2, (d−f) SL-SnS2, and (g−i)
EL-SnS2.

TEM also confirmed the
formation of vertically grown connected
nanopetals (Figures 2a,b and S2a), which supports the SEM results.
Each individual flower consisted of a large number of nanosheets.
HRTEM confirmed that the SnS2 nanopetals were crystalline
in nature and grew in the direction of the (001) plane (Figure 2b) with a lattice spacing of
∼0.59 nm. TEM of the SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2 further confirmed the structural features of the well-defined hexagonal
plate and eclipsed (Figures 2c,e and S2b,c), which was also
verified by HRTEM (Figure 2d,f). This suggests that the surface of the nanosheet is composed
mainly of {001} facets, which is in good agreement with the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis
was conducted to confirm the presence of sulfur (S) and tin (Sn) in
the sample, as shown in Figure S3.

different solvents: (a,b) FL-SnS2, (c,d) SL-SnS2, and (e,f) EL-SnS2.

On the basis of the SEM and TEM morphological structures,
the formation
of nanostructures can be described by considering the various steps
involved. The solvents and precursors play important roles in catalyzing
the reaction and increasing the kinetics of the solvothermal reaction.
Previous reports recommend that the concentration of the sulfur source
also plays a critical role in the growth and assembly of SnS2 nanostructures.20Figure 3 presents a schematic diagram of the growth
of the 2D formation of SnS2 sheets, 3D FL-SnS2 nanopetals, and ellipsoid-shaped SnS2 structures via
the solvothermal process.

Figure 3 Schematic diagram of the formation mechanism
of SnS2 nanostructures.

The 3D SnS2 flowers were formed from the assembly
of
two-directional sheets of SnS2, which was constructed using
various steps, including nucleation, growth aggregation, self-assembly,
and Ostwald ripening. On the other hand, the precise mechanism of
the formation of such architectures is still unclear and requires
a detailed investigation. On the basis of previous reports and the
present observation and optimization, the sulfur concentration and
different solvents play an important role in constructing such types
of architectures of SnS2. In the beginning of the solvothermal
reaction, tin anions interact with acetic acid and form a complex,
whereas TAA decomposition leads to the formation of H2S
at elevated temperatures, which can be illustrated in the following
reaction: 1   2   3  

This mechanism can be explained
in two ways. The first is the precipitation
of the metal sulfide by TAA at a low pH, and the second is the direct
reaction of TAA with the metal precursor at a high pH.21,22 The presence of acetic acid in the present case obviously follows
the first condition, in which the hydrolysis of TAA formed hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), which is followed by the formation of small
SnS2 nuclei. These tiny nuclei grow and form the 2D nanostructures
because of the anisotropic crystal structure of SnS2.23 The presence of the H2S gas bubbles
in the solution due to the hydrolysis of TAA induces the aggregation
and self-assembly of the 2D SnS2 onto the gas bubbles at
the gas–liquid interface to minimize the interfacial energy.24 These processes ultimately lead to the formation
of 3D SnS2 during the optimized reaction condition, such
as temperature and time. On the other hand, the lower reaction time
may reduce the aggregation of tiny 2D crystals of the SnS2, which leads to the formation of immature 3D SnS2, whereas
no significant change was observed at prolonged reaction times up
to 12 h. In addition, acetone and water were also used for further
investigation of the solvent effect, and different morphologies were
observed in the cases of acetone and water. Only the ellipsoid-shaped-type
morphology was observed in the case of water, which clearly highlights
the role of the solvent in controlling the morphology of the SnS2.

Prior to crystal growth and assembly, the tin anion
forms a complex
with acetic acid while the decomposition of TAA leads to the formation
of H2S, which is driven by the ramping temperature of the
electric oven. The H2S formed dissociates further into
hydrogen and sulfide ions. The presence of tin ions in the solution
induces the formation of a SnS2 colloid. When MeOH was
used, the initial SnS2 nanosheets and SnS2 tiny
crystal seeds formed progressively, and during the growth process,
they tended to self-assemble and aggregate to form 3D SnS2 nanopetals. On the other hand, various process, such as nucleation,
growth aggregation, self-assembly, and Ostwald ripening, may also
be involved in the growth of SnS2. Although the precise
mechanism for the growth of the nanostructures is unclear and requires
a detailed investigation, these 3D assembly structures have been reported
elsewhere.25,26 A separate synthesis experiment
with different solvents, such as acetone and water, was carried out
to confirm the role of the solvent in the formation of the morphology.
A 2D sheetlike morphology was obtained when acetone was used instead
of ethanol (Figures 1d−f and S1b). In the case of water
as a solvent, however, the morphology was completely different (Figures 1g−i and S1c). These results suggest that the solvent
plays a critical role in the growth and assembly of SnS2 nanocrystals.

The crystal and phase structures of the as-prepared
SnS2 nanostructures were examined by XRD, as shown in Figure 4a. All phases of
the SnS2 nanostructures were well-matched with the standard
plane
position of JCPDS 022-0951 with lattice parameters of a = b = 3.648 Å and c = 5.894
Å of the SnS2 nanostructures. According to the Bragg
equation, the calculated d-spacings of the (001) plane for the SL-SnS2, EL-SnS2, and FL-SnS2 were 0.594, 0.60,
and 0.61 nm, respectively, in which the SL-SnS2 showed
good agreement with that (0.589 nm) of the hexagonal SnS2 nanostructure. The peak intensities of the SL-SnS2 and
EL-SnS2 were higher than that of the FL-SnS2, indicating the good crystallinity of the SL-SnS2 and
EL-SnS2. The strong XRD peaks of the SL-SnS2(001) indicate that the processing conditions influence the oriented
growth of the SnS2 products, which is in keeping with the
SEM and TEM results.

in SnS2.

For energy storage applications,
the texture properties of the
materials play a crucial role by providing sufficient surface area
to store the charge during the electrochemical measurement.23 Therefore, a careful investigation of the qualitative
and quantitative properties of SnS2 nanostructures was
conducted by the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis
carried out at 77 K. Table S2 lists the
mean pore size, pore volume, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area of the SnS2 nanostructures. The surface area
of the SnS2 samples is affected by the solvents. As shown
in Figure 4b, the FL-SnS2 sample exhibited the characteristic type IV adsorption isotherms
with a sharp adsorption at low pressures and a prominent hysteresis
loop at the intermediate pressure range, indicating that the FL-SnS2 possesses a mesoporous structure. Among the SnS2 nanostructures, the FL-SnS2 exhibited the highest surface
area (64.8 m2/g), whereas the SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2 showed surface areas of ∼27.4 and 32.9 m2/g, respectively. The pore size of the SnS2 nanostructures
(Figure 4c) showed
two different levels of pores. The FL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2 nanostructures had a pore diameter less than 10 nm with a
maximum diameter of ∼5.1 nm in the case of EL-SnS2 and ∼7.5 nm for the FL-SnS2 sample. In the case
of the SL-SnS2, the pore size was larger than 10 nm, indicating
that it is macroporous in nature.

XPS was conducted to understand
the surface electronic states and
chemical composition, that is, types of tin (Sn) and sulfur (S) bonds
as well as the percentage of Sn and S atoms present in the synthesized
sample. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure 4d) provides a complete view on the surface
elemental composition of the SnS2 nanostructures. Figure S4 shows the atomic percentage of the
elements on the SL-SnS2, EL-SnS2, and FL-SnS2 surface. The SL-SnS2 showed 63.49% tin and 36.51%
sulfur; the FL-SnS2 contained 59.89% tin and 41.11% sulfur;
and the EL-SnS2 showed 65.76% tin and 34.23% sulfur, as
shown in Figure 4e.
At a higher resolution, the deconvoluted XPS spectra of the FL-SnS2 displayed two sharp peaks at ∼486.9 and ∼495.3
eV (Figure 4e), which
are characteristics of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2, respectively. These two peaks were clearly separated by a splitting
energy of ∼8.4 eV, which is the representative value of Sn4+ in SnS2. The high-resolution XPS spectra of S
2p displayed two spin orbital coupling peaks centered at 161.9 and
163.1 eV, which were assigned to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, in the S2– chemical state (Figure 4f). The binding energies
related to Sn4+ and S2– were in good
agreement with the literature.27,28 In addition to the
XPS measurements, EDX analysis confirmed the presence of sulfur and
tin in the FL-SnS2 (Figure S3).

2.1 Electrochemical Properties
Morphological
changes also affect the electrochemical performance of the materials.
To understand these effects, the electrochemical properties of the
EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes
were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge–discharge
(CD) methods. These analyses are the most prominent device for evaluating
the capacitive behavior of the materials. Generally, metal sulfide
electrodes in the alkaline electrolytes store charge at the interface
of the electrode/electrolyte and in the bulk electrode material. Figure 5 presents the CV
curves of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes at a 50 mV/s scan rate over the potential range
0.0–0.50 V. Figure S5 shows the
CV curves of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 at various scan rates, ranging from 5 to 50 mV/s. The CV
curves of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes were different from the ideal rectangular curves,
which originate from the EDLC and indicate pseudocapacitance characteristics.
The CV profiles showed oxidation and reduction peaks, such as the
anodic peak (positive current density) and cathodic peak (negative
current density). A pair of redox peaks in the CV curves suggests
that the charge storage happened because of the redox reaction rather
than the EDLC. All of the SnS2 morphologies show the presence
of strong cathodic and anodic peaks, which are attributed to the redox
reaction; the cathodic peak for all EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes could be attributed to
the electrochemical insertion of K+ in the interlayer of
the SnS2 layer structures.11 Among these prepared electrodes, the FL-SnS2 electrode
possessed a significantly larger enclosed area than those of the EL-SnS2 and SL-SnS2 electrodes. This enhanced performance
of the FL-SnS2 electrode might be due to the 3D structure
of the FL-SnS2, which provides a larger surface area and
better pore size than the EL-SnS2 and SL-SnS2 and can expose more active sites for the intercalation of ions.
With increasing scan rate, the redox current increased, resulting
in a shift of the anodic peak toward the positive potential, whereas
the cathodic peak was shifted to the negative potential. The increase
of the current response indicates that the kinetics of the interfacial
faradic redox reactions and the rate of electronic or ionic transport
are rapid enough at the present scan rate. Even at a high scan rate,
a similar shape of the CV curves was maintained, which indicates the
good capacitive behavior and reversibility of the samples (Figure S5).

50 mV/s, (b) comparative
CD profiles of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes at a fixed current load of 1 A/g, (c) CD profile

of the EL-SnS2 at different current loads, (e) CD profile
of the SL-SnS2 at different current loads, and (f) specific
capacitance of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 at different current densities.

The specific capacitance was measured by the charge discharged
to highlight the capacitive values of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes over the potential range
0.00–0.50 V. Figure 5b shows the CD profiles of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes at a current density of
1 A/g. The FL-SnS2 presented better capacitance performance
(∼431.82 F/g) at a current density of 1.0 A/g than the EL-SnS2 (∼390.38 F/g) and SL-SnS2 (∼117.72
F/g), which might be due to its unique 3D flowerlike structure. Figure 5c presents the CD
curves of the FL-SnS2, whereas Figure 5d,e shows those of the EL-SnS2 and SL-SnS2 at current densities ranging from 1 to 10
A/g. The specific capacitances of the SL-SnS2 at current
densities of 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10 A/g were ∼112.72, ∼104.95,
∼67.76, ∼67.00, ∼44.24, ∼35.36, and 28.8
F/g, respectively, whereas for the EL-SnS2, they were 390.38,
366.24, 247.20, 240.30, 171.52, 121.04, and 100.40 F/g, respectively.
Similarly, the specific capacitances of the FL-SnS2 were
∼431.82, ∼398.88, ∼312.18, ∼272.00, ∼230.70,
∼156.88, and ∼126.20 F/g at current densities of 1,
2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10 A/g, respectively. In particular, the FL-SnS2 exhibited a higher specific capacitance because of its unique
3D structure, which offers a better pore size and large surface area,
which may provide more active sites for the electrolyte intercalation
during the CD process and maximize its utilization, as an electrode
material.5Figure 5f presents the specific capacitance plotted
as a function of current density for the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 samples. The specific capacitance
decreased with increasing current density owing to the decreased penetration
of electrolyte into the pores of the electrode materials.5

The specific capacitance was higher than
the previously reported
literature value for the SnS2 supercapacitor electrode
materials (Table 1).
For example, the tin sulfide nanorods showed ∼70 F/g at 0.5
mA/cm2 and molybdenum-doped few-layered SnS2 showed ∼213.2 F/g at 1 A/g, which is lower than that of the
as-prepared FL-SnS2.11,14 The cycling stability
is an important issue in relation to the energy storage characteristics
of supercapacitors. The cycling stabilities of the EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2 electrodes were examined
by CD analysis using eq 4. As shown in Figure 6a, the SnS2 nanostructures (EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2) showed good cycling stability at
5 A/g and retained ∼90, ∼82, and ∼80% capacitance
for the FL-SnS2, EL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2, respectively, after 2000 CD cycles, showing that the material has
better cycling stability than those reported previously for sulfur-
and metal oxide-based materials.4,11,14,28−30 Furthermore,
at a lower current density of 3 A/g, the FL-SnS2 (Figure S6) retained 70% capacitance with an excellent
Coulombic efficiency of 95% at the end of 4500 CD cycles, which further
highlights the advantage of the SnS2 electrode. For more
insight, the morphology of the FL-SnS2 electrode was also
analyzed after 4500 consecutive CD cycles using SEM analysis. In Figure S7, the SEM images proved that the petals
of the FL-SnS2 become irregular during the large cycling
process but the morphology of the FL-SnS2 was almost similar
to that of the fresh FL-SnS2 electrode. This highlights
the advantages of the present as-synthesized FL-SnS2 architecture.
The capacitance of the FL-SnS2 was significantly higher
than those of the other EL-SnS2 and SL-SnS2materials.
On the other hand, for a broader context of the work, the capacitance
of the FL-SnS2 was compared with those of the other SnS2-based materials, as listed in Table 1. In addition, the retention of the SnS2 nanostructure electrode materials highlights their excellent
long-term cycling stability and suggests the high reversibility and
excellent electrochemical stability of the material.5,31 Clearly, the as-synthesized FL-SnS2 exhibited excellent
rate capability compared to the EL-SnS2 and SL-SnS2. In the cycling stability test of the EL-SnS2,
FL-SnS2, and SL-SnS2, despite showing a similar
trend (Figure 6b),
they exhibited significantly higher charging and discharging times,
indicating that a larger number of electrons and electrolyte ions
contribute to the charge and discharge processes.5,32

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
technique was further
used to examine the interfacial properties and electron-transfer properties
of the as-synthesized SnS2 electrodes. Figure S8 shows the impedance spectra of the SL-SnS2, EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2 electrodes, which show a
semicircle in the high-frequency region and a sloping straight line
in the low-frequency region. The high-frequency area generally represents
the series resistance of the equivalent circuit, which is related
to the combination of the solution, intrinsic, and contact resistances
at the interface of the electrolyte and electrodes.5 The equivalent series resistance values of the SnS2 electrodes with the SL-SnS2, EL-SnS2, FL-SnS2 are ∼0.5, ∼0.6, and 0.5 Ω,
respectively. The semicircle in the high-frequency region corresponds
to the charge-transfer resistance and constant phase element between
the electrode/electrolyte interface.5 From
the inset of Figure S8, it can be clearly
seen that the high-frequency region semicircle diameter of the SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2 electrodes are smaller than that of
the FL-SnS2 electrode, implying that the flowerlike structure
of the SnS2 electrode possesses a favorable and fast charge-transfer
behavior as compare to the other two SnS2 electrodes (SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2). These results confirmed that the
flowerlike structure improved the electrochemical performance and
cyclic stability of the FL-SnS2 electrode material. Furthermore,
the low-frequency region consists of two straight lines, in which
the smaller slope can be attributed as Warburg impedance that is associated
with the diffusion of electrolyte in the SnS2 and the large
slope demonstrates the capacitance nature of the electrode, respectively.35,36 The Nyquist plots of all SnS2 electrodes (Figure S8) explain the pseudocapacitance nature
of the electrode.

3 Conclusions
Three
different SnS2 nanostructures were synthesized
using a facile and simple solvothermal method. The sheet-assembled
FL-SnS2 achieved a higher specific capacitance of ∼431.82
F/g compared to the SL-SnS2 and EL-SnS2, demonstrating
that it is an efficient and effective method to enhance the electrochemical
performance of the materials through modifiable morphological structures.
Moreover, the FL-SnS2 has a larger surface area and better
average pore size, which results in a higher specific capacitance,
which perfectly matches the experimental results. SnS2 is
suitable for large-scale production because of its facile synthesis
method.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
TAA was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Tin chloride pentahydrate was acquired from Alfa Aesar. Acetic acid
was purchased from Junsei (99.7%), and ethyl alcohol was provided
by Duksan Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., South Korea. Deionized water was
obtained from a Pure Group 30 water purification system.

4.2 Characterization
The surface morphology
and internal structure of the as-prepared samples were examined by
SEM (Hitachi-S4800-Japan) and field emission transmission electron
microscopy (FE-TEM-Technai G2 F20-FEI-USA). The crystallinity and
phase were analyzed by XRD (PRO-MPD, PANalytical, The Netherlands)
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). The surface composition
and chemical behavior of the samples were examined by XPS (ESCALAB-250,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, U.K.) using a monochromatized Al Kα
X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV). The textural
properties were measured by the N2 adsorption–desorption
method using a volumetric gas adsorption apparatus (ASAP-2020, Micromeritics
Inc., USA). The pore size distribution was estimated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
model.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical performance was examined using a three-electrode system
with a platinum sheet, AgCl/Ag electrode, and Ni foam coating with
the mixture of the electrode material as the counter, reference, and
working electrodes, respectively. The working electrode was prepared
using the electrode material, activated carbon, and Nafion solution
at a mass ratio of 80:10:10, and 1 mL of ethanol was then added and
stirred for 20 min. Subsequently, the mixed and ground slurry was
coated on the Ni foam current collector and dried at 80 °C for
12 h. All electrochemical measurements were carried out using a VersaSTAT
3, Princeton Research, USA Electrochemical Workstation, in a 2 M KOH
aqueous solution. The loading of the active electrode material was
calculated based on the mass difference before and after drying, and
the mass of each electrode material was ∼1.5 mg.

Galvanostatic
CD and CV are generally used to calculate the electrochemical performance
of the electrode materials. The specific capacitance can be calculated
as follows:11,19 4  where I is the constant discharge
current and t is discharge time. The potential window
is symbolized by ΔV, and the mass of the active
electrode material is represented by m.

4.4 Synthesis of SnS2 Nanostructures
Table S1 lists the various reports of
hydrothermal/solvothermal SnS2 nanostructures with different
morphologies. The SL-SnS2, FL-SnS2, and EL-SnS2 were synthesized using a modified solvothermal method that
involved changing the solvent during the reaction procedure to confirm
the effects of the solvent on the morphology of the material. In a
typical procedure, an appropriate amount of tin chloride pentahydrate
was dissolved in an acetic acid solution and stirred magnetically
for 5 min, which was followed by the addition of 55 mL of solvent
(methanol, acetone, and water) to the solution and then 1.5 g of TAA
as the sulfur source. After dissolving the precursor, the solution
was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated
in an electric oven at 160 °C for 10 h. After the reaction, the
autoclave was allowed to cool naturally to room temperature and the
yellow-colored sample was collected after vacuum filtration. The final
product was dried in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 6 h and stored
in a desiccator for further characterization. The sheetlike SnS2 synthesized using acetone as the solvent is abbreviated as
SL-SnS2, flowerlike SnS2 synthesized using methanol
as the solvent is abbreviated as FL-SnS2, and ellipsoid-like
SnS2 synthesized using water as the solvent is abbreviated
as EL-SnS2.
