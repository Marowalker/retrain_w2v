This
mini review focuses on the effect of preparation technologies
on the piezoelectric property of KNN-based materials. The piezoelectric
properties of KNN-based ceramics can be optimized by controlling the
condition for sintering and poling processes. The preparation method
of textured and single crystals could realize an increased piezoelectric
constant compared to that of corresponding ceramics. According to
current developments in preparation technology, we also provide perspectives
and outlooks of lead-free KNN-based materials.

1 Introduction
Among the alternatives
replacing lead-based piezomaterials, KNN-based
materials have been considered as one of the most promising candidates
to replace the lead-based ones due to a large piezoelectric constant
(d33) and high Curie temperature. In general,
chemical modification (e.g., Li+, Ba2+, Sb5+, Ta5+, CaZrO3, Bi0.5Na0.5ZrO3, SrTiO3, etc.) and new phase
boundary construction [e.g., rhombohedral–orthorhombic–tetragonal
(R–O–T), rhombohedral–tetragonal (R–T),
etc.] have been employed.1 As shown in Figure 1, the ceramics with
O–T phase boundary are first investigated, and the ceramics
with the R–O phase boundary have a relatively low d33. Interestingly, the d33 can be promoted by constructing new R–T or R–O–T
phase boundaries. For example, a large d33 of 570 pC/N by constructing the R–T phase boundary can be
obtained due to the coexistence of nanoscale domains (1–2 nm)
and a high density of ferroelectric domain boundaries.2 A higher d33 of 650 pC/N by
forming a relaxor R–O–T phase boundary was reported
in 2019, which is the highest value in reported work so far in nontextured
KNN-based ceramics.2 However, the d33 of KNN-based ceramics can be maximized only
by optimizing the sintering and poling conditions. In addition, the
reaction template grain growth (RTGG) can further promote the d33 of KNN-based ceramics.3 Improvement of electrical properties can be also obtained
in KNN-based single crystals and/or thin films by optimizing the preparation
technologies.4,5

In this mini review, the progress in preparation technologies for
KNN-based materials is summarized and discussed, and the effect of
preparation technologies on the piezoelectricity of KNN-based polycrystalline
ceramics is highlighted. In addition, we also summarize the factors
affecting the piezoelectric constant of textured ceramics, single
crystals, and thin films.

2 Polycrystalline KNN-Based
Ceramics
Sintering technology could affect the phase structure
and microstructure
(e.g., grain size, point defect, domain structure) of KNN-based ceramics.
Some sintering methods can enhance piezoelectricity, including two-step
sintering, spark-plasma sintering, hot-press sintering, etc. In addition,
sintering aid, sintering temperature and atmosphere, and poling condition
also influence the piezoelectricity of polycrystalline ceramics.

2.1 Sintering Methods
Some sintering
methods have been used to increase the sinterability of KNN-based
ceramics, including conventional sintering (CS), multistep sintering,
spark-plasma sintering (SPS), hot-press sintering (HPS), microwave
sintering (MS), etc. Subsequently, we systematically review the development
of three kinds of sintering technologies which have been widely used
in the sintering process for fabricating KNN-based ceramics.

2.1.1 Multistep Sintering
The samples
were heated to a high temperature and held for a long time in the
CS process. The rapid grain growth that has a serious impact on the
density and piezoelectricity of the ceramics would occur in the CS
method, which can be inhibited by a two-step sintering (TSS) method
using different kinetics between grain boundary diffusion and grain
boundary migration. In the TSS process, the samples were heated to
a higher temperature (T1) and held for a short time (t1) to achieve
an intermediate density and then cooled to a lower temperature (T2)
and held for a long time (t2) to achieve the maximum density without
final-stage grain growth. High d33 (350–400
pC/N) over a wide sintering temperature range (400–1050 °C)
can be found in KNN-based ceramics with R–T coexistence phases
and dense microstructure without heavy loss of alkali elements by
the TSS method.7 In 2019, a high d33 of 455 pC/N was realized due to the quite
uniform grain size distribution and parallel domain stripes with hierarchical
nanodomain structure, which were prepared by TSS with a tailed dwelling
time in the second step.8 In addition,
considering the issues in two-step sintering in which the volatility
of alkali elements occurred because of the relatively high T1 in the
first step and a quite long dwelling time in the second step, a high
density value (97.5%) and an increased d33 (436 pC/N) can be obtained in KNLNTS ceramics using a modified TSS.9 Furthermore, the improved d33 of 420 pC/N can be achieved in KNLNS-CaZrO3 ceramics
with an O–T phase structure in a three-step sintering method,
which adjusts the sintering temperature and holding time and can also
be considered as a modified TSS.10

2.1.2 Spark-Plasma Sintering
The volatilization
of alkali elements can be restrained under a high sintering rate and
short dwelling time in the SPS method, in which a pulsed direct current
is passed through a graphite punch rod and then dies with a uniaxial
pressure. Zhang et al. fabricated the KNN ceramics using SPS, showing
a d33 of 148 pC/N with O phase.11 A high relative density of 99.2% and d33 of 162 pC/N in LKNNT ceramics can be achieved
by utilizing SPS and postanneling procedures due to the moderately
coarse grains and O–T phase transition.12 Although the volatilization of alkali elements can be controlled
by the SPS method, too small grain size produced by the SPS process
may affect the d33 of KNN-based ceramics.

2.1.3 Hot-Press Sintering
The application
of pressure would provide extra driving force for diffusion, improve
the density, and decrease the grain size, resulting in the dense KNN-based
ceramics and the increased d33 with a
nanoscale grain size by HPS. A pure KNN ceramic with O phase, together
with a grain size of 0.1 μm, a relative density of 96%, and
an increased d33 of 120 pC/N, can be found
by HPS.13 The KNN-Al2O3 ceramics with a pure O phase exhibited dense microstructure and
fine grains via hot-press sintering, facilitating a d33 of 137 pC/N and a relative density of 97%.14 Similar to that in the SPS fabrication technology,
small grain size may limit the d33 of
KNN-based ceramics by this method.

2.1.4 Relationship
among Sintering Methods, Structure,
and Piezoelectricity
The phase structure caused by chemical
modification affects the piezoelectricity of KNN-based ceramics. As
shown in Figure 2a,b,
both KNLNTS-CS and KNLNTS-TSS ceramics displayed O–T phase coexistence
but with different volume fraction ratios at room temperature. In
addition, the corresponding uniform grain size distribution and parallel
stripes with a hierarchical nanodomain structure were considered
to be related to the high d33 of 446 pC/N
and relative density of 97.6% in KNLNTS-TSS ceramics, compared to
that in KNLNTS-CS ceramics (d33 = 396
pC/N and the relative density is 94.8%), as shown in Figure 2c,d.8

In addition, the enhanced piezoelectricity in KNN-based
ceramics
by applying diverse sintering methods could be attributed to
the suitable grain size, which affected the phase structure, piezoelectric
constant, and domain structure. A phase transition from R to R–T
and a sharply increased d33 could be observed
in the ceramics around the average grain size of 1 μm (see Figure 2e–g), indicating
that coarse-grained ceramics significantly influence the phase structure
and piezoelectricity. Typical strip-like nanodomains with 20–100
nm in the coarse-grained ceramics with R–T and a higher d33 of 450 pC/N could be observed (see Figure 2k,m), compared to
the fine-grained ceramics with single R, in which only a few irregular-shaped
domains could be seen in the abnormally grown grain region (see Figure 2f,l).15

2.2 Sintering Condition
Apart from the
sintering methods we discussed above, the sintering conditions in
the practical sintering process also have an important role in the
piezoelectric properties of KNN-based ceramics, including the addition
of sintering aids and changing sintering temperature and sintering
atmosphere.

2.2.1 Sintering Aids
High sintering temperature
(>1000 °C) will cause the volatility of alkaline K and Na
elements
in KNN-based ceramics, which makes it difficult to obtain high sinterability
and dense ceramics. Adding sintering aids is considered to be a useful
method to improve the density and enhance the piezoelectricity, as
well. Liquid-phase sintering in KNN-based ceramics can be produced
by doping various sintering aids including CuO, ZnO, Na2B4O7·10H2O, LiF, or MnO2, leading to the decreased sintering temperature.16−18 As shown in Figure 3a–d, the piezoelectricity was increased by doping optimum
content of MnO2, ZnO, Bi2O3, or CuO.
Large d33 and a strain of 340 pC/N and
470 pm/V, respectively, were found in KNN-BLT-BZ ceramics via doping
1.5 wt % MnO2, and an excellent temperature stability was
also obtained from room temperature to 170 °C (see Figure 3e).19 The reduced defects and the improved domain mobility caused by doping
1.5 wt % MnO2 (see Figures 3f,g) can contribute to the enhanced piezoelectric property.19 However, it is noted that different combinations
of sintering aids exhibit diverse impact on the electrical properties.
For example, codoped SiO2–CuO in KNN-based ceramics
was reported to deteriorate the piezoelectric properties (d33 = 12 pC/N), but the enhancement of Qm (1598) could be observed, as well.20

2.2.2 Sintering Temperature
As shown
in Figure 4a, the sintering
temperature can significantly influence the piezoelectricity of KNN-based
ceramics. In general, the highest d33 could
be obtained at an optimum sintering temperature, whereas a deteriorated d33 can be observed at a sintering temperature
that deviated from the optimum one. In KNN, KNNL, and KNNLT, the optimized
temperature of the highest d33 value was
in the narrow range of about 20–30 °C lower than the temperature
of the highest density due to the effect of composition and densification.22 The sintering behavior of KNN, KNLN, and KNLN-BT
ceramics was investigated, and three stages of the sintering process
in the conventional sintering method can be summarized: (i) arrangement
of randomly shape particles and formation of a stack of plate-type
particles; (ii) rapid grain growth facilitated by the formation of
a liquid phase, which was Na-deficient composition; (iii) dominant
process of the sintering procedure included densification slowing
and microstructural coarsening, illustrating that the liquid phase
was a crucial factor to acquire dense and uniform microstructure.23 Furthermore, the change of sintering temperature
could induce transitions in both phase structures and grain sizes.
The average grain size increased with the increased sintering temperature,
accompanying the corresponding variation of phase structures from
R–T to O–T (see Figure 4b–f).24 Abnormal
grain regions, fine grains surrounding coarse grains, and small nanodomain
size (60 nm) were observed in the KNNT-BNKZ-CZ ceramics sintered at
1180 °C, which were responsible for the excellent piezoelectric
properties (see Figure 4g).24

2.2.3 Sintering
Atmosphere
Sintering
atmosphere could affect the existence of oxygen vacancies in KNN-based
ceramics and finally influence the microstructure and piezoelectric
properties. The influence of synthetic air (80% N2, 20%
O2), O2, and Ar sintering atmosphere on the d33 of KNLNTS ceramics was studied, showing that
the ceramics sintered in O2 possessed the maximum d33 of 260 pC/N.27 In reducing atmosphere, the valence state of Nb is usually stable
and the valence state of Mn ions is +2, which can prevent the decrease
of Bi3+, restrain the appearance of a liquid phase, and
improve formation of homogeneous grain size, leading to an increase
of piezoelectricity. An enhanced d33 of
300 pC/N can be observed in KNN-BNZ-MnO ceramics with R–T sintered
in reducing atmosphere (H2/N2/H2O, PO2 = 1 × 10–11 MPa).28

2.3 Poling
Condition
The poling process
is an important procedure in preparing KNN-based ceramics, in which
the domains inside the ceramics would rotate along the outside electric
field orientation when the direct current (DC) field or alternating
current (AC) field is employed. Generally, the right choice of optimum
poling temperature, which is near the polymorphic phase transition
temperature, is an efficient way to improve the piezoelectricity regardless
of phase structures (see Figure 5a1–d1).29 As shown
in Figure 5a2–d2,
a saturated d33 of the R–T/O–T/R–O
phase structure can be achieved in a low electric field, whereas the d33 of the ceramics with O or T could be saturated
under a higher electric field, which was related to domain vibration,
domain wall motion, domain switching, electric-field-induced phase
transition, and decreased energy barrier initiated from the coexistence
of a multiphase structure, revealing that the construction of a multiphase
coexistence phase structure was an effective way to achieve high
piezoelectricity of KNN-based ceramics under a low electric field.29 In addition, d33 values of KNNS-BHNH ceramics decreased slightly with increased poling
temperature in both AC and DC electric fields; furthermore, the d33 increased and remained at a maximum value
when the ceramics were poled in both AC and DC electric conditions,
whereas a saturated d33 could be easily
obtained in DC electric fields compared to the AC electric fields,
as shown in Figure 5e1,e2.30

3 Fabrication Technology and Piezoelectricity
for Other Types of Materials
In addition to KNN-based ceramics,
KNN-based textured ceramics,
single crystals, and thin films also have attracted more and more
attention. In this part, we mainly introduce the relationship between
the preparation method and piezoelectricity of textured ceramics,
single crystals, and thin films.

3.1 Textured Ceramics
As shown in Figure 6a, the precursors
were prepared by a molten salt synthesis or two-step molten salt method
first, and then the obtained precursors were used to form templates
using a topochemical microcrystal conversion method. Then, KNN-based
powders were fabricated using a conventional solid-state method and
then mixed with the prepared templates to form a homogeneous slurry.
After that, the mixture was treated by tape casting, followed by a
pressing and sintering process, and finally the textured ceramics
were synthesized. The procedures for templated grain growth (TGG)
and reactive-templated grain growth (RTGG) methods are very similar.
The templates in these procedures are plate-like NaNbO3 in the most cases, whereas the templates in the homoepitaxial TGG
method and hetero-TGG method are very special. One of the biggest
breakthroughs in piezoelectricity of KNN-based ceramics is the discovery
of highly ⟨001⟩ textured LF4T ceramics with a d33 of 416 pC/N prepared by the RTGG method.6 Furthermore, ultrahigh d33 of 700 pC/N and an orientation degree of 0.98 were achieved
in highly textured KNNS-CZ-BKH ceramics (Figure 6b) prepared by the TGG method using plate-like
NaNbO3 as a template, which could be explained by the strong
anisotropic feature, optimized domain configuration, facilitated polarization
rotation induced by the intermediate M phase, nanodomain structures
with decreased domain wall energy, and increased domain wall mobility.3 However, it cannot be ignored that the content
of the NN templates must be optimum for each KNN-based ceramic system
because the lack or excess templates would accelerate the composition
deviation, which could induce the decrease in the piezoelectricity,
as shown in Figure 6b.3

3.2 Single Crystals
The piezoelectric
property of KNN-based single crystals is higher than those of the
polycrystalline counterpart because of the well-aligned polarization
orientation and domain engineering in single crystals. KNN-based single
crystals have been successfully prepared using various methods, such
as flux method, Bridgman method, solid-state crystal growth (SSCG),
simple molten salt synthesis (SMSS), seed-free solid-state crystal
growth method (SFSSCG), top-seeded solution growth method (TSSG),
etc.4 The as-grown single crystals were
rectangular or triangular, and those single crystals are not transparent,
which may be attributed to the substitution of the doped ions on the
A/B sites or the entity of small pores inside the crystals because
of the rapid growth of crystals or the presence of many domain walls
inside (see Figure 7). In addition, the addition of Mn ions has a big influence on the
phase structure and piezoelectric properties of KNN-based single crystals.
A high d33 of 545 pC/N with O–T
was obtained in KNNLT/Mn single crystals as compared with the d33 of 354 pC/N with pure O in KNNLT single crystals.34 An ultrahigh d33 of 1050 pC/N can be realized in KNN–LiBiO3–MnO2 single crystals with O–T using the SFSSCG method.4

3.3 Thin Films
Large-area deposition
films could be obtained utilizing RF magnetron sputtering, but the
interface defects induced during high-energy particle bombardment
and hardly controlled compositions of films due to the different deposition
rates of elements are non-negligible disadvantages. Pulsed laser deposition
(PLD) has been widespread used in preparing high-quality films, but
the created interface defects during high-energy particle bombardment,
the induced composition deviation from the target because of the elements’
different deposition rates, and the lack of large-film preparation
are cannot be ignored. The advantages of aerosol deposition are the
high deposition rate and the formation of dense films with a thickness
of about 1–100 μm at room temperature, but it is hard
to obtain the oriented films due to the unordered collisions of particles
and substrates. Chemical solution deposition, which is also called
the sol–gel method, has attracted much attention due to its
homogeneous composition, easy control of chemical composition, the
thickness of the obtained films, the ability to prepared large-area
films, and the low cost and easy processing procedure. However, it
is difficult to produce films thicker than 1 μm, and the films
always present a poor piezoelectricity owing to the high leakage current
caused by oxygen and alkali ion vacancies. SFSSCG and RTGG, the methods
used to prepare single crystals and textured ceramics, can also
be utilized to deposit films, which could improve the piezoelectricity
by forming an ideal oriented structure and avoiding the influence
of substrate clamping.

The electric properties of films are
greatly affected by chemical modification, the substrate type and
temperature, working temperature and pressure, the distance between
the target and the substrate, and the matched degree and residual
stress between films and substrates (or electrodes). Shibata et al.
prepared KNN films with a high transverse piezoelectric coefficient
by annealing optimum temperature after deposition and optimizing the
K/Na ratio using the RF method and Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si as the
substrate.35 The conductive perovskite
oxide electrode, such as LaNiO3, is preferential owing
to its close lattice constant with KNN-based films in the RF method.36 PLD epitaxial KNLNT-CZ film exhibited a dielectric
constant of 1185 under various oxygen pressures of 15–45 Pa
and substrate temperatures of 600–720 °C on a (001)-SrTiO3 substrate utilizing La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 as the bottom electrodes.37 A
28 μm ⟨100⟩-orientated KNLN single-crystal-thick
film possessed a superior piezoelectric constant of 490 pm/V prepared
using SFSSCG and a new lapping down method.38 In addition, the effect of chemical modification on the electric
properties of KNN films has also been reported using the PLD method,
such as Ba2+ doping and Sr2+ doping.39

Furthermore, the difficulty of constructing
phase boundaries
and the existence of composition deviations caused by the volatilization
of alkali elements and the lattice mismatch between thin films and
substrates (or electrodes) combined lead to the complicated development
of high piezoelectric performance thin films. Fortunately, Wang et
al. obtained a large orientation degree of 62.8% (see Figure 8a) and effective piezoelectric
strain coefficient of 250 pm/V (see Figure 8b) in KNNS-BNKZ0.05 films due to the oriented
nanometer scale coexistence of the R–T phase structure with
gradual polarization rotation (Figure 8c), which can lower the domain wall energy and improve
the piezoelectric property.40 The increased
KNNS-BNKZ0.05 thin film thickness of 2.7 μm (see Figure 8d) could produce more free
deformation along the thickness direction and promote the domain wall
mobility, also leading to the increased piezoelectric property.40

4 Conclusion
and Outlook
High piezoelectric constants have been achieved
by constructing
phase boundaries and choosing optimum sintering processes and poling
conditions in KNN-based ceramics. A large piezoelectric coefficient
is observed through the construction of the phase structure and employing
a suitable prepared method and templates in textured ceramics. The
largest piezoelectricity is obtained among the KNN-based lead-free
materials by using optimum preparation technology in single crystals.
However, the piezoelectricity of KNN-based thin films reported until
now is still lower than that of the KNN-based bulk, which needs further
investigation. Although it has been statistically shown that prepared
methods have played an important part in piezoelectric properties,
a comprehensive theoretically model is further needed to find the
origin of the high-piezoelectric performance of KNN-based materials.
Finally, close attention should be paid to the high performance of
KNN-based materials as well as cheaper and more convenient preparation
methods. Solving the large-scale preparation issue would be great
progress for KNN-based materials. We believe that KNN-based materials
would be the most promising alternatives to lead-based materials in
commercial applications.
