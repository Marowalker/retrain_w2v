Glucokinase phosphorylated
a series of C-1 fluorinated α-d-gluco-heptuloses. These
phosphorylated products were discovered
to be inhibitors of α-phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase
(αPMM/PGM) and β-phosphoglucomutase (βPGM). Inhibition
potency with both mutases inversely correlated to the degree of fluorination.
Structural analysis with αPMM demonstrated the inhibitor binding
to the active site, with the phosphate in the phosphate binding site
and the anomeric hydroxyl directed to the catalytic site.

Introduction
Ketoheptoses are rare
naturally occurring seven-membered sugars
that are receiving increasing attention due to their potential pharmaceutical
applications in the treatment of hypoglycemia or cancer.1 Ketoheptoses, especially d-manno-heptulose
(Figure 1), as a substrate
for noninvasive imaging of β-cells,1 provides an alternative tool in diabetes diagnosis or therapies
that depend on β-cell mass visualization and quantitative analysis.2 Recently, it was found that fluorinated heptulose
analogues functioned as tools for the noninvasive imaging of GLUT2-expressing
insulin-producing cells by 19F magnetic resonance imaging
(19FMRI).3 In order to evaluate
their spectrum of potential biological activities, ketoheptose analogues
have been accessed by either chemical1,4 or enzymatic5 methods, with fluorinated carbohydrates as prominent
tools to study various biochemical processes including structural
and mechanistic investigations,6 radio-labeling,7 lectin–carbohydrate interactions,8 and carbohydrate lipophilicity.9 Further functionalization of ketoheptoses will provide
access to mechanistic probes such as C-glycosides or analogues of
glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) or glucose 1-phosphate (G1P). However, to
date, such phosphorylated fluorinated ketoheptoses have not been prepared
or evaluated. Synthetic access would provide opportunities to explore
a variety of biological systems, including probing the structure and
function of phosphoglucomutases (PGMs).

and C-1 fluorinated α-d-glucoheptulose 7-phosphates1-4
prepared herein.

PGMs catalyze the reversible
intramolecular conversion of G6P to
G1P, and play essential biological roles in numerous living organisms
from bacteria to humans.10 There are two
different classes of PGMs, α-phosphoglucomutases (αPGM)
and β-phosphoglucomutase (βPGM), differing in the substrate
anomer and enzyme mechanism of action. βPGM from Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), a member of haloacid dehalogenase superfamily,11 is essential in the maltose and trehalose catabolic pathway
of L. lactis.12 α-Phosphomannomutase/PGM (αPMM/PGM) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) belongs to the α-d-phosphohexomutases family and
has dual substrate specificity for α-mannose 1-phosphate and
αG1P.13 In P. aeruginosa, αPMM/PGM is involved in the biosynthesis of alginate, B-band
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rhamnolipid, and the LPS-core.14 These polysaccharides are essential components
of the bacterial cell wall and are implicated in P.
aeruginosa virulence. Additionally, P. aeruginosa is a deadly opportunistic human pathogen
listed as a significant threat by the World Health Organization.15 These data make this enzyme a potential target
for antibacterial drug design.

Both enzymes share a similar
mechanistic pathway, consisting of
two enzymatic phosphorylations (Figure 2),13 involving a single
active site phosphoenzyme, which is serine (Ser) in αPGM and
aspartic acid (Asp) in βPGM. The first step involves the transfer
of the phosphoryl group from the phosphoenzyme to the C6–OH
group of G1P, and formation of an intermediate glucose 1,6-bisphosphate
(G16BP). After reorientation and rebinding to the active site, this
intermediate (step 2) is converted to product G6P by phosphoryl transfer
back to the dephosphoenzyme from the C1–OH group, thus finishing
the catalytic cycle.

Figure 2 Reactions catalyzed by α- and β-PGM.

Early probes into the mechanism
of αPGM include galactose
1,6-bisphosphate16 and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate,17 as G16BP analogues, whereas 1-deoxyglucose 6-phosphate
was evaluated as an inhibitor of αPMM/PGM from P. aeruginosa.18 Attempts
to inhibit αPGM covalently have included evaluation of sugar
phosphofluoridates, sugar cyclic phosphates,19 and nojirimycin 6-phosphate.20 Metal
complexes have also been studied, as mimics of the transferred phosphate,
including with αPGM and 6-vanadate-αG1P21 and more recently with βPGM in aluminum and magnesium
fluoride complexes,22 together with the
G6P23 and with the nonhydrolyzable monofluoromethylene
phosphonate substrate analogues that enabled access to the first βPGM
phosphoryl transfer step.24

Herein,
we describe Escherichia coli glucokinase
(Glk)-catalyzed phosphorylation of a series of C-1 fluorinated
α-d-gluco-heptuloses, and evaluation of the 7-phosphates 1–4, as αG6P analogues, against both α-
and β-phosphoglucomutases.

Results and Discussion
It was envisioned that the αG6P analogues, 1–4 could be accessible by an E. coli Glk25-catalyzed phosphorylation of the
7-OH group of the appropriate C-1 fluorinated ketoses, in turn obtained
from global debenzylation of compounds, 8–11 (Scheme 1). These intermediates
were all readily obtained starting from protected gluconolactone 5. Methylated compound 9,26 monofluoromethylated compound 10,27 and trifluoromethylated compound 11(28) were readily prepared, starting from 5 according to the reported procedures, where nucleophilic
addition of commercially available CH3Li and TMSCF3 to 5 furnished 9 and 11, respectively. In contrast, the direct synthesis of the difluoromethylated
compound 8 required a different approach due to lack
of a convenient difluoromethyl nucleophile. As a result, diethyl difluoromethyl
phosphonate (DDMP)29 was utilized for this
purpose.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of (a) compound 8 and (b) 1–4
The synthesis of compound 8 (Scheme 1a) commenced with 6, prepared
by nucleophilic addition of DDMP to 5.30 The resultant phosphonate 6 then rearranged
at 55 °C with anhydrous K2CO3 to yield
phosphate 7 quantitatively. The rearranged structure 7 was confirmed by analysis of NMR data. In the 1H NMR spectrum of 7, a new triplet signal at 6.6 ppm
was assigned as H-1. Additionally, a doublet of signals for each fluorine
and a singlet signal were observed in the 19F{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 7, respectively (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). By comparison for 6, the fluorine and phosphorus
signals were an ABX spin system and a triplet in the 19F{1H} and 31P{1H} NMR, respectively,
arising from 19F–19F and 19F–31P coupling (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Finally, acidic hydrolysis of the
phosphate group in 7 with 6 N HCl/1,4-dioxane afforded 8 in 54% yield, with spectroscopic data consistent with those
reported.31 This method to make 8 is very efficient, on the gram scale with 40% overall yield from 5 with column chromatography only after the final step. This
is the first time this rearrangement incorporates a difluoromethyl
group into a carbohydrate.

Compounds 8–11 were subjected to hydrogenolysis
(Scheme 1b) with either
Pd(OH)2/C–H2 or Pd/C–H2 to provide the corresponding α-d-gluco-heptulose
analogues, 12–15 in quantitative yields. Compound 13 is known to inhibit glucose metabolism and insulin secretion
and also has potential as a tracer for the noninvasive imaging of
hepatocytes and insulin producing cells by 19FMRI.3 Therefore, the difluoro and trifluoro compounds 14 and 15 may have similar utility.

Glk
is known as a glucokinase rather than a hexokinase, which specifically
phosphorylates gluco-configured substrates.25 Analogues 12–15 were examined as substrates
of Glk, utilizing conditions described in the literature.32 Recombinant Glk was found to efficiently convert
all four C-1 fluoromethyl-modified G1P analogues (12–15) to corresponding 7-phosphorylated products. This result demonstrates
that Glk tolerates a glucopyranose sugar modified at the anomeric
center. Quantitative conversion of these compounds (Scheme 1b) on a milligram scale through
overnight incubation with Glk was achieved as observed by 1H NMR or 19F{1H} NMR spectra. The pure products
were then isolated exclusively as α-anomers in 73–98%
yield by selective precipitation of adenosine diphosphate and adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) with ethanol, followed by size exclusion chromatography.32 The observation of a doublet signal for the
C-7 (2JC-7,P = 7.5 Hz)
and C-6 (3JC-7,P = 4.0
Hz) due to the 13C–31P coupling in the 13C{1H} NMR spectra of 1–4 further
confirmed these G6P derivative structures.

Based on the anomeric
configuration, it was hypothesized that these
αG6P analogues could be potential substrates of αPMM/PGM
from P. aeruginosa but inhibitors of
βPGM from L. lactis. We were
also curious about how these enzymes would respond to the increasingly
bulkier and electronegative C-1 modification from 1 to 4. Initially compounds were evaluated as substrates. None
of compounds 1–4 proved to be substrates of either
αPMM/PGM from P. aeruginosa or
βPGM from L. lactis up to a concentration
of 0.2 mM, presumably due to the methyl substituent at C-1 blocking
phosphoryl transfer by αPMM/PGM or βPGM (Scheme S1 in
the Supporting Information). As a result,
they were evaluated as potential inhibitors of these enzymes at various
concentrations (0–1000 μM) by measuring their IC50 values (Figure S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information) through a coupled assay, as described in the literature.24b,33 It was noteworthy that these analogues (1–4),
although structurally similar to G6P, showed no significant inhibition
against G6P dehydrogenase, the second enzyme used in the coupled assay
(a maximum of 15% inhibition at 5 mM inhibitor concentration was observed).
The inhibition results of compounds 1–4 against
αPMM/PGM and βPGM are summarized in Table 1.

c Calculated from IC50 data.34

The Ki values were calculated based
on the IC50 values, Km, and
substrate concentration using the published equations.34 As the substrate concentration was equal to Km under the assay conditions, Ki = 1/2IC50 for either competitive or uncompetitive
inhibitors, whereas Ki = IC50 for the noncompetitive inhibitors. Based on the structural data
(vide infra), the αG6P analogues (1–4) were
assumed to be competitive inhibitors of αPMM/PGM from P. aeruginosa or βPGM from L.
lactis, with Ki values
calculated to be between 65 and 174 μM for αPMM/PGM and
from 57 to 310 μM for βPGM. Interestingly, a trend was
observed in that the IC50 value increased in the order 1 to 4 against αPMM/PGM. This trend is
in accordance with the increasing bulkiness35 and electronegativity36 of the substituent
(CH3 < CH2F < CHF2 < CF3) at the anomeric center. It was noteworthy to find that this
trend was also observed in the βPGM data, although these analogues
are not in the enzyme-favored β-anomeric configuration. These
results demonstrate that both αPMM/PGM and βPGM activity
is tunable in response to the steric component at the anomeric center
of the physiological substrate, G6P.

To study the structural
interactions of these G6P analogues with
αPMM/PGM, we utilized the protein PGM from Xanthomonas
citri (XcPGM),13 a phytopathogen,
known for being the causative agent of citrus canker. XcPGM is 34%
identical overall in amino acid sequence to P. aeruginosa PMM/PGM, and active site residues in the two proteins are very highly
conserved (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). Crystals of XcPGM diffract to high resolution and are amenable
to the formation of ligand complexes.37 Crystal structures of XcPGM as apo-enzymes and in complexes with
G1P and G16BP were previously published (PDB IDs: 5BMN, 5BMP, and 5KLO, respectively).37 These structures are used for comparisons with 1:XcPGM below.

A high-resolution structure (1.7 Å)
was obtained for XcPGM
in complex with compound 1 (PDB ID: 6N1E). Successful complex
formation is consistent with the Ki of
this compound (Table 1). As seen in other ligand complexes of XcPGM,37 binding of 1 produces a conformational change
of the protein, relative to the apo-enzyme. This involves an active
site loop in the C-terminal domain (cyan in Figure 3A) of the protein (residues 415–421)
that closes around the inhibitor, essentially creating a lid over
the active site. Thus, 1 is deeply buried in the active
site cleft, with less than 20% of its surface area exposed to solvent.

Electron density (green) is contoured at 3.0 σ. Residues involved
in interactions with ligands are shown as sticks. Hydrogen bond lengths
and the distance from Ser97 to O1 of 1 are indicated.

It is convenient to consider the
binding modes of compound 1 relative to the interactions
of XcPGM with its substrate
αG1P.37 As first shown in crystallographic
studies of αPMM/PGM,38 binding of
1- and 6-phosphosugars involves similar enzyme contacts to the phosphate
group of the ligand, while accommodating alternate orientations of
the sugar ring in the active site. This arrangement is necessitated
by the 180° flip of the G16BP intermediate, required by the enzyme
mechanism (compare sugar ring orientation of αG1P and G6P in Figure 2). The XcPGM/1 complex provides characterization for a 6-phosphosugar complex.
In particular, this includes interactions with Arg414, Arg423, Asn417,
Ser416, and Thr418 of the phosphate (Figure 3B and Table S2), that is, the same residues used for phosphate binding in αG1P.

By contrast, interactions with the hydroxyls of the sugar ring
vary significantly due to the alternate orientation of the sugar ring.
Glu320 is able to maintain a key bidentate interaction with O3 and
O4 because these hydroxyls essentially exchange places (Figure 3B). However, the backbone amide
of His303 contacts O3 in the 1 complex, instead of O4
as in the G1P complex (Table S2). Other
changes include loss of an interaction between Arg280 and O2 due to
its distinct position in the 1 complex.38 Overall, it appears that inhibitor 1 utilizes
the expected binding interactions of a 6-phosphosugar with the enzyme,
despite replacing the anomeric hydrogen atom with a methyl substituent.
There are no protein atoms within 4.5 Å of this methyl group.
Owing to the shared phosphate binding interactions with both G1P and 1, the observed binding mode is consistent with competitive
inhibition (Table 1).

Conclusions
In conclusion, synthetic access to four C-1
fluorinated α-d-gluco-heptulose analogues was accomplished
through chemical
manipulations of gluconolactone 5. Derivatizing these
heptulose analogues by E. coli Glk
led to corresponding α-d-gluco-heptulose 7-phosphate
analogues 1–4 that are inhibitors of both αPMM/PGM
and βPGM. Inhibition potency against both enzymes is dependent
on the size and electronegativity of the substituted group at C-1
position, with the C-1 methylated G6P analogue (1), displaying
the most significant inhibition. Both enzymes were found to be sensitive
to the steric and electronic environment at the anomeric center of
G6P. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 1 with XcPGM
demonstrates that this inhibitor occupies the enzyme active site and
that the methyl substituent does not form specific contacts with active-site
residues. These structural insights will guide future potential antibacterial
drug design targeting P. aeruginosa αPMM/PGM and will be reported in due course.

General Procedure: Glk-Catalyzed Synthesis of 7-Phospho Analogues
This followed the literature procedure with minor modifications.32 A final volume of 4 mL (50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7. 5) comprising 1-deoxy-α-d-glucoheptuloses (50
μM), MgCl2 (102 mg, 500 μM), ATP (200 mM, 500
μL), and recombinant E. coli Glk
(28 mg mL–1, 110 μL) was incubated at 37 °C
overnight.

The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition
of three volumes of ethanol, followed by centrifugation at 5000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and
the solvent was evaporated in vacuo. The above manipulation was repeated
once by re-dissolving the resultant material in millipore water (1
mL) and ethanol (9 mL). The resulting residue was then redissolved
in 0.6 mL of distilled water and desalted by size exclusion chromatography
(Sephadex LH20) eluting with millipore water. Fractions containing
the product were collected, concentrated, and lyophilized.

Lactone 5 was prepared from commercially
available 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl glucopyranose, following
a known procedure,30 and then converted

mg, 0.18 mmol) in CH3OH was added 20% wt Pd(OH)2/C (30 mg). The suspension was degassed under vacuum and saturated
with H2 in a Parr Shaker at 60 psi pressure. This reaction
mixture was shaken overnight. When the starting material disappeared
completely, as determined by TLC monitoring, the catalyst was removed
by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure

The solution was then cooled to −78 °C. A solution of
diethyldifluoromethylphosphonate (0.87 mL, 5.55 mmol) in anhydrous
THF (1 mL) was added dropwise. The solution was stirred for 25 min
and 5 (1.00 g, 1.85 mmol) in anhydrous THF (5 mL) was
added dropwise. The solution was stirred for 30 min at −78
°C. When the reaction was complete, as determined by TLC monitoring,
it was quenched by the addition of saturated aq NH4Cl (3
mL) and diethyl ether (50 mL). The aqueous layer was further extracted
with diethyl ether (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic layers were
dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under
reduced pressure. The residue obtained was used in the next step without
further purification. An analytic amount of pure sample was obtained
by silica gel flash chromatography (n-hexane/EtOAc
= 4) for characterization purposes.

Protein Overexpression and Purification
βPGM,
αPMM/PGM, and Glk were overexpressed, purified, and quantified
as previously described.40 The gene for
XcPGM was commercially synthesized (GenScript) and inserted into the
pET-14B vector with an N-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease
cleavage site and His6-affinity tag. The plasmid was transformed
into E. coli BL31(DE3) for recombinant
protein expression. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB media,
supplemented with 0.1 mg mL–1 of ampicillin to an
OD600 of 0.8–1.0. Cultures were then cooled at 4
°C for at least 30 min, whereby, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 0.4 mM) was added,
and the cultures were incubated for ∼18 h at 18 °C. Cell
pellets were collected by centrifugation, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C.

For purification,
frozen cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mM sodium phosphate,
0.3 M NaCl, pH 7.8) containing 14.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.5 mM tosyllysine chloromethyl
ketone, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgSO4, and 10 μg/mL
of DNase. A French press was used for cell lysis. The soluble fraction
containing XcPGM was obtained through centrifugation. Protamine sulfate
was added at 5 mg/g of cell pellet over 15 min, stirred for 30 min,
and centrifuged. The supernatant was mixed with Ni2+ affinity
resin (His-Select, Sigma), which had been previously equilibrated
in buffer A, and incubated for 30 min on a two-way orbital rocker.
The mixture was transferred into a gravity-packed column and washed
with buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.8. Protein was eluted
using buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.8. The purified
protein was dialyzed into a solution of 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.0, with
0.3 M NaCl. TEV protease was added to the purified protein at 5% w/w.
The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 4 h and left overnight
at 4 °C. The mixture was then incubated with pre-equilibrated
Ni2+ affinity resin for 30 min. Cleaved XcPGM was retrieved
in the flow-through and dialyzed into 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4, with
0.3 M NaCl and concentrated to ∼11 mg mL–1. The purified protein was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at −80 °C. Total yield of protein from 1 L of cell culture
was ∼80 mg.

Crystallization and Complex Formation
Purified XcPGM
was initially screened for crystallization via hanging-drop vapor
diffusion using the previously published conditions,37 which did not yield data collection quality crystals. Several
commercial screens were then utilized, including Morpheus 1 and Hampton
Crystal Screen 1. Optimizations were set up around several hits, and
a final condition of 22% PEG 8000, 0.2 M MgCl2, 0.1 M HEPES,
pH 7.5, was identified and used for all crystals described herein.
Crystals typically grew overnight at 18 °C. Despite the different
crystallization conditions, the XcPGM crystals reported here were
isomorphous with those published previously (Table S2).

The CH3G6P complex was obtained by soaking crystals
with high concentrations of the ligand. The ligand solution at ∼20
mM was prepared in the crystallization buffer supplemented with cryoprotectant
of 25–30% PEG 3350. Crystals were removed from the drop, dipped
quickly into the ligand solution, and immediately flash-cooled and
stored in liquid N2.

X-ray Diffraction Data
Collection and Refinement
Diffraction
data were collected at a wavelength of 1.00003 Å from single
crystals on beamline 4.2.2 of the advanced light source using a Taurus-1
CMOS detector in the shutterless mode. Data were processed using XDS41 and AIMLESS42 in
CCP4i.43 Data processing statistics are
listed in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information). Values of CC1/2 > 0.3044 and Rpim(45) were used to determine the high resolution cutoff due to the large
number of images (900–3600 per data set) and high redundancy
obtained with the shutterless data collection.

Crystallographic
refinement calculations were initiated using coordinates of apo-XcPGM
(PDB ID: 5BMN). Refinement was performed with PHENIX;46 progress was monitored by following Rfree, with 5% of each data-set set aside for cross validation. The B-factor
model consisted of an isotropic B-factor for each atom; TLS refinement
was used as automated in PHENIX. Occupancy of the ligand was also
refined and converged at 0.82. COOT47 was
used for model building. The structures were validated using MolProbity,48 and the refinement statistics are listed in
Table S1 (see the Supporting Information). Likely hydrogen bond criteria and lengths were determined by CONTACT
in CCP4.43 Structural figures were prepared
with PYMOL.49 The coordinates and structure
factor amplitudes have been deposited in the PDB under the accession
numbers listed in Table S1 (see the Supporting Information).

Kinetic Inhibition Assays (IC50 Determination) of
Analogues 1–4 Against αPMM/PGM and βPGM
IC50 Determination of βPGM
Assays
were carried out in a final volume of 200 μL containing 50 mM
HEPES pH 7.2, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM NAD+, 5 U/mL
G6PDH, 150 μM αF16BP, 10 μM βG1P, 83 nM βPGM,
and 5–1000 μM inhibitor (1–4). βPGM
was pre-incubated with αF16BP for 30–45 min. Reactions
were initiated by addition of the pre-incubated βPGM/F16BP mixture
to the remaining reaction components.

IC50 Determination
of αPMM/PGM
Assays
were conducted in a final volume of 200 μL containing 50 mM
MOPS buffer pH 7.4, 3.6 mM MgCl2, 0.9 mM NAD+, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5 U/mL G6PDH, 2 μM αG16P, 20 μM
αG1P, 0.242 μM αPGM/PMM, and 5–1000 μM
inhibitor (1–4). αPMM/PGM was pre-incubated
with αG16P for 1–1.5 h. Reactions were initiated by addition
of the pre-incubated αPMM/PGM/αG16P mixture to the remaining
reaction components.
