CCSD(T) methods in conjunction with correlation consistent
basis
sets are used to predict the pKa for the
deprotonation of methane in a 3d metal ion adduct, [M···CH4]+ (M = Sc–Cu), in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent,
which is modeled by the SMD continuum solvent model. Results show
that the coordination of methane to different M+ ions has
a substantial difference of ∼27 pKa units, from most to least acidic, and increases the acidity of the
methane C–H bond from ∼8 to 36 pKa units. Furthermore, even with the omission of the more expensive
quadruple and quintuple zeta basis sets in the prediction process,
similar trends in pKa(C–H) as a
function of 3d metal ions are exhibited. This research serves to illustrate
the substantial effect that metal ion identity has on the acidity
of a coordinated hydrocarbon and the utility that correlation consistent
basis sets have in lowering the computational cost of modeling larger
systems.

Introduction
Methane activation by organometallic catalysis
remains a field
of intense study, as it has significant technological implications.
Methane is both plentiful, being the primary component of natural
gas, and quite valuable. The process of methane conversion has a multitude
of industrial applications, including the production of fuel that
could serve as an alternative energy source to the conventional petroleum
and coal. However, because of the thermodynamic strength of the C–H
bonds in methane and its very low acidity and basicity, it is difficult
for methane to react readily.

Previous studies by Olah and co-workers1 have shown that methane only becomes reactive
in superacidic systems,
allowing for the protonation of methane as well as methane conversion.2 Similarly, the work of Streitwieser and Taylor
demonstrated that methane is only deprotonated in superbasic systems.3 These works illustrate the significance that
reaction conditions have on influencing methane activation. Superacid
and superbasic systems still typically require forcing conditions
and highly reactive reagents for methane conversion and, in most cases,
are stoichiometric not catalytic.

Presently, the relationship
between pKa of coordinated C–H
bonds and metal identity is an under researched
area of organometallic chemistry.4 Whereas
the acidic properties of a variety of organic carbon acids are reasonably
well known,5 particularly in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) solvent, there have been few studies concerning the acidity
of C–H bonds within transition-metal structures. Indeed, one
rare study by Christman et al. investigates the enhancement of pKa for aromatic substrates by coordination to
Pd(II).4 In their experiments, these researchers
estimated an increase in the acidity of arene C–H bonds by
40 orders of magnitude or more upon coordination to cationic Pd(II)
complexes.

In the present study, a Brønsted–Lowry
acid/base reaction
was examined, involving 3d transition-metal methane adducts of the
form of [M···CH4]+ and the solvent
DMSO to gain more insights into the impact of the metal on the acid/base
properties of aliphatic C–H bonds in the coordination sphere
of a 3d metal ion. In the observed reaction (Figure 1), initially, the methane adduct is loosely
coordinated to the M(I) ion (Figure 2). After the deprotonation of [M···CH4]+, a shorter M–C bond is formed along with
a neutral methyl complex (Figure 3), which maintains sp3 hybridization at
the carbon. In one study, Fallah and co-workers found that deprotonation
of a methyl C–H bond was a competing side reaction to methane
functionalization.6 Thus, investigating
the acid/base properties of aliphatic C–H bonds of both hydrocarbon
and hydrocarbyl complexes within the coordination sphere of a transition
metal is important in catalyst design.

All 3d metal ions were assumed to have a formal
oxidation state
of 1+ in order to facilitate comparison among the various methane
adducts. Highly accurate coupled cluster (CCSD(T)) calculations are
performed to assess how metal identity impacts the intrinsic acid/base
properties of a methane C–H bond within the coordination sphere
of a first-row transition-metal ion (Sc through Cu). Furthermore,
CCSD(T) simulations, in conjunction with correlation consistent basis
sets, can serve as a benchmark for future studies using more approximate
density functional theory (DFT), which may be applied to larger, more
experimentally relevant catalyst candidates.

Results and Discussion
pKa Values for 3d Metal(I) Methane
Adducts
Given the simplicity of the present models, our main
goal is to assess trends—rather than absolute values as a function
of metal upon the Brønsted–Lowry acidity of a methane
C–H bond within the coordination sphere of a 3d metal ion.
Calculating the deprotonation of free methane with several complete
basis set (CBS) extrapolation methods outlined in Computational Methods, it is less acidic than coordinated
methane with an average pKa(C−H)
of 49.5 and a standard deviation of ±0.3 pKa units

The predicted ground-state multiplicities of
the cationic 3d metal methane adducts studied (Table 1) all agreed with experimental data reported
in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database
for the “naked” metal monocations, except that of Cr(I),
where single point CCSD(T) calculations predicted that [Cr(I)···CH4]+ was a quartet ground state, but the NIST database
suggested that the naked chromium cation should be a sextet.7 Likewise, the predicted multiplicities of the
studied methyl complexes also agreed with the findings of Rinaldo
et al. and McKee.8,9

Adducts and Methyl Complexes Predicted from CCSD(T) Computations

[M···CH4]+ multiplicity	1	4	5	4	7	6	3	2	1

In Table 2, the
average estimated pKa of extrapolation
methods is displayed along with the standard deviation in pKa values for each respective metal. Figure 4 shows that the pKa(C–H) values as a function of the 3d
transition metals follow a trend, in which the acidity rises and falls
twice, peaking at Ti+ and Mn+.

consistent basis sets (cc-pVXZ for X = 2 (DZ), 3 (TZ), 4 (QZ), and
5 (5Z)) at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d)-optimized geometries.

a Averages and standard deviations
were calculated with the values obtained from the extrapolation methods
of each respective metal, excluding the DZ, TZ, QZ, and 5Z values
obtained from the cc-pVXZ energies.

Initially, the basis sets cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ,
and cc-pV5Z
were utilized in calculating single point energies. However, as the
study progressed, it became apparent that the quintuple zeta basis
set was not critical to determine accurate pKa(C–H) estimates, as all extrapolation schemes yielded
values within ±2.1 pKa units (Table 2). Because the deviation
in predicted pKa values is quite small
(Table 3), one could
argue that the quadruple zeta basis set may also be unnecessary in
approximating pKa values. Figure 4 further implies that the least
expensive DZ and TZ basis sets show the same trends as the CBS extrapolations
as well as the more expensive QZ and 5Z basis sets. Only utilizing
the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets, which are less computationally
expensive, would enable larger organometallic complexes to be studied
as well.

Conclusions
The goal of this study was to examine the
effect metallic identity
has on the acidity of a coordinated aliphatic C–H bond using
highly accurate CCSD(T) simulations in conjunction with correlation
consistent basis sets and several CBS extrapolation techniques. It
is clear from the present research that there is a very noticeable
impact of the metal ion, as the highest and lowest pKa values differ by ∼27 pKa units (Table 2). Furthermore, coordination of methane to the 3d metal ion results
in a dramatic increase in acidity as compared to that of free methane,
ranging from ∼8 to 36 pKa units.

It was observed that less expensive basis sets may be utilized
to obtain an accurate estimate of acidic properties (cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ)
or reproduce trends as a function of metal (cc-pVDZ). Employing just
the cc-pVDZ and cc-pVTZ basis sets (Table 3), the resultant pKa values vary only slightly when compared to those that also
utilize the cc-pVQZ and cc-pV5Z basis sets (Table 2). This is an important point to consider
for further research, especially when dealing with larger metal complexes.
Future studies could be worthwhile in investigating whether similar
trends exist in more complex systems, pKa values other than DMSO, or complexes with more realistic ligands.
Furthermore, CCSD(T) simulations, in conjunction with correlation
consistent basis sets, can serve as a benchmark for future studies
using more approximate DFT, which can be applied to larger, more experimentally
relevant catalyst candidates. Another intriguing result of this research
is the fact that pKa correlates surprisingly
well not just with metal ion identity but also with C–H bond
lengths and vibrational frequencies (see the Supporting Information), which appears to be an additional point of interest
for further investigation. Ultimately, while this study has made it
clearer the impact that 3d metals have on the pKa(C–H), there remains much to be uncovered about what
other chemical effects impact acidity, for example, the ligand environment
as well as “outer sphere” effects such as hydrogen bonding,
electrostatic and dispersion forces, and so forth.

Computational Methods
Geometry optimizations were performed
with the Gaussian09 software package using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level
of theory.10 Single point energies were
calculated with the Gaussian16 software package using the UCCSD(T)
technique and the following basis sets: cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, cc-pVQZ,
and cc-pV5Z.11 Tests with restricted open-shell
CCSD(T) calculations for the titanium and nickel complexes did not
appreciably change the predicted pKa(C–H)
values nor did the computed ⟨S2⟩ expectation values suggest issues from spin contamination.
Likewise, tests with larger, more expensive core-valence correlation
treatments (the “Full” and “FreezeInnerNobleGasCore”
options in Gaussian16) and consideration of scalar relativistic effects
(Douglas–Kroll–Hess second-order scalar relativistic
calculation) changed estimated pKa(C–H)
values by less than 1 pKa unit. Additionally,
the use of augmented correlation consistent basis sets was tested
on methane adducts of Sc+, Ti+, and Ni+, changing pKa estimates by only as much
as 0.3 pKa units.

The energies obtained
from the UCCSD(T) technique paired with correlation consistent basis
sets were used to extrapolate to the CBS limit by employing various
extrapolation schemes gathered by Vasilyev:12 exponential (eq 1),13 power function (eq 2),14 mixed Gaussian (eq 3),15 eq 11 in the paper by Vasilyev9 (eq 4),16 three parameters (eq 5),13 two parameters with integer exponent
4 (eq 6),13 and two parameters with integer exponent 3 (eq 7).11 The extrapolations were applied with the following equations 1   2   3   4   5   6   7  where nx represents the cardinal number of the xth
basis set used and Ex denotes the electronic energy obtained from the xth basis set used. Obtaining the electronic energies at the basis
set limit, the Gibbs free energy correction of each respective structure
(obtained from DFT geometry optimization and vibrational frequency
calculation) was then applied to calculate the Gibbs free energy at
the basis set limit (GCBS). From the GCBS free energies, the ΔGCBS of deprotonation was computed for each of the 3d metals.
In order to estimate the pKa of each metal,
the following formula was used  to obtain an initial pKa value. A linear correction derived from the published work
of Nazemi and Cundari17 was then applied
to the pKa calc. to get the final estimated
pKa of the methane adduct, [M···CH4]+ (M = Sc–Cu).
