A theoretical methodology
based on quantum chemistry to calculate
mechanical properties of polymer crystals has been developed and applied
to representative polymers. By density functional theory calculations
including a dispersion force correction under three-dimensional periodic
boundary conditions, crystal structures of poly(methylene oxide) (PMO),
polyethylene (PE), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(trimethylene
terephthalate) (PTT), and poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) were
optimized and their mechanical properties, such as crystalline moduli
and linear and volume compressibilities, were calculated. The optimized
crystal structures were proved to be fully consistent with those determined
by X-ray and neutron diffraction. The crystalline moduli (E∥) parallel to the chain axis were calculated
to be 114 GPa (PMO), 333 GPa (PE), 182 GPa (PET), 7.1 GPa (PTT), and
20.8 GPa (PBT) and compared with those determined from X-ray diffraction,
Raman spectroscopy, and neutron inelastic scattering experiments.
Herein, the E∥ values thus determined
are interpreted in terms of conformational characteristics of the
polymeric chains and the validity of the homogeneous stress hypothesis
adopted in the X-ray diffraction method is also discussed.

Introduction
Mechanical properties
are crucial characteristics of polymeric
materials, especially from a practical viewpoint. Solid polymers are
composed of crystalline and amorphous regions, and the former is more
rigid than the latter. In general, polymer crystals exhibit the largest
modulus in the chain axis direction; therefore, the crystalline modulus
(E∥) parallel to the chain axis
at 0 K may correspond to the ultimate hardness expected from the polymer.
By reference to the ultimate modulus, one can determine whether the
polymer is suitable for one’s practical application and estimate
how much the mechanical properties will be improved by processings
such as stretching and annealing. Therefore, it is of particular significance
to determine the crystalline moduli of polymers as precisely as possible.
The E∥ values of polymers have
been estimated by experiments such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
and neutron inelastic scattering (NIS).1,2 For example,
the E∥ value of polyethylene (PE)
has been reported as 150–254 GPa (X-ray), 260–358 GPa
(Raman), and 329 GPa (NIS) (see Table 3); unfortunately, the experimental data are considerably
scattered.

Of the experimental methods, X-ray diffraction is
the most common.3 The change (Δd) in lattice
spacing due to a load (F) is observed by X-ray diffraction
to evaluate the strain (ϵ = Δd/d0) and the stress (σ) is estimated as F/A, where d0 is the lattice spacing without load and A is the
cross-sectional area of the sample. The slope of the stress–strain
curve yields Young’s modulus of the crystal. On the assumption
that both crystalline and amorphous regions are subjected to a homogeneous
stress, the microscopic strain ϵ is directly related to the
macroscopic stress σ. The X-ray experimentalists have argued
that the homogeneous stress hypothesis was already demonstrated,4−6 whereas not all researchers have accepted the assumption.2,7,8 In fact, as referred to PE above,
the E∥ values from X-ray diffraction
tend to be smaller than the other experimental and theoretical data
(see Table 3). Therefore,
the validity of the homogeneous stress model has occasionally been
disputed for these several decades in the community of polymer science.
For the above reasons, the principle of natural science, i.e., theory
must be proved by experiment, would not be simply applied to this
case; therefore, a universal methodology to yield the ultimate crystalline
moduli of polymers has been desired, regardless of whether it is experimental
or theoretical.

From molecular orbital (MO) and density function
theory (DFT) calculations,9−19 Young’s moduli (E∥) of
PE have been estimated and fall within the range of 300–400
GPa. The models have mostly been a single chain of finite length,
namely, n-alkanes; therefore, weak interchain interactions
of van der Waals (vdW) forces were not considered and hence the lateral
modulus, E⊥, cannot be derived
from the simplified model. In the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
crystal,20 interchain π/π interactions
between the benzene rings fulfill a significant role to form and stabilize
the crystal structure because the free PET chain strongly prefers
a trans–gauche–trans conformation (by approximately
−1.2 kcal mol–1) to trans–trans–trans
in the O–CH2–CH2–O part21 but nevertheless crystallizes in the all-trans
structure at the expense of the conformational stability so as to
form the effective π/π stacking, which must significantly
influence both E∥ and E⊥ magnitudes. As for such polymer crystals, we
are required to accurately evaluate the interchain interactions of
vdW forces.

For the above reasons, we have conducted density
functional theory
calculations with a dispersion force correction under three-dimensional
periodic boundary conditions22,23 for representative
polymers with different crystal structures and chain conformations,
namely, poly(methylene oxide) (PMO, 9/5 or 29/16 helix),24−26 polyethylene (PE, all-trans),27 poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET, all-trans),20 poly(trimethylene
terephthalate) (PTT, tggt),28,29 and poly(butylene terephthalate)
(PBT, g+g+tg–g–),30−32 where the abbreviation and crystal conformation are
written in the parenthesis. The crystalline moduli in the directions
parallel (E∥) and perpendicular
(E⊥) to the chain axis or in the
crystal a, b, and c axis directions (Ea, Eb, and Ec, respectively) of these polymers have
been derived from the calculated compliance tensors and compared with
the experimental and theoretical data reported so far. Herein, the
theoretical methodology and results are explained in detail and the
validity of the experimental data is discussed.

Results and Discussion
Poly(methylene
oxide)
It is well known that poly(methylene
oxide) whisker, exceptionally, includes no amorphous phase.33 Therefore, the PMO whisker is expected to give
the true crystalline moduli directly; however, the whisker crystal
itself is so small that it has to be embedded in resin matrices and
undergo the mechanical measurements and Young’s modulus (E∥) of the whisker at room temperature
was indirectly evaluated to be about 100 GPa.34 Young’s modulus of a highly oriented PMO film was estimated
by X-ray diffraction to be 44 GPa at room temperature and 105 GPa
at −150 °C.35 From Raman and
infrared frequency shifts induced by tensile stress, Young’s
moduli of highly oriented PMO samples were determined to be 75 GPa
at room temperature and approximately 100 GPa at −150 °C.8,36

The E∥ value of highly
oriented PMO sample was calculated from its vibrational spectroscopic
data to be 109 GPa.36 From molecular force-field
calculations using the COMPASS parameters,37 the E∥ and E⊥ values were evaluated to be 122 and 28 GPa, respectively.38 In summary, Young’s modulus in the chain
axis direction may depend on temperature. However, at as low temperatures
as −150 °C, the experimental E∥ data stay within a narrow range of 100–105 GPa, being comparable
to the theoretical values (109–122 GPa).

In Table 1, the
results of the geometrical optimization at the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p)
level are summarized. The DFT-D calculations represent the structure
and properties at 0 K, thus being preferably compared with the crystal
structure at −150 °C.26 Of
the four kinds of computations, the set III parameters yielded the
best agreement with the cryogenic structure. For the atomic coordinates,
see Table S4 (Appendix B, Supporting Information).

The DFT-D calculated crystalline
moduli in the chain axis direction
range from 105 to 132 GPa, thus being comparable to that (100 GPa)
of the PMO whisker34 and that (105 GPa)
measured at −150 °C.35 In contrast,
the E⊥ value depends significantly
on the dispersion force correction (5.0–32 GPa). This is because
the E⊥ value reflects interchain
forces due mainly to van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The experimental E⊥ value at room temperature was reported
as 8 GPa;39 therefore, Young’s moduli
at cryogenic temperatures must be larger than the value. The E⊥ distributions on the ab plane, calculated from eq 16, are plotted in Figure 1. All of the distributions are perfect circles, whose
radii correspond to the magnitudes of E⊥. This is because the PMO chain strongly prefers the gauche conformation
(the energy difference from the trans state is −1.5 to −2.5
kcal mol–1)40 and hence
forms a uniform helical structure. The stiffness (C) and compliance (S) tensors derived from the set
III calculation are as follows 1   2

Polyethylene
The crystal structure of PE at room temperature
was earlier determined by Bunn:27 an orthorhombic
lattice of space group Pnam with a = 7.40, b = 4.93, and c = 2.534
Å. Afterward, its crystal structures at cryogenic temperatures
have also been determined by X-ray and neutron diffraction. The neutron
diffraction may precisely define atomic coordinates of hydrogen as
well as carbon atoms. Table 2 shows the lattice constants and fractional coordinates determined
at different temperatures. The a and b dimensions are seen to depend largely on temperature and show a
tendency to increase with temperature, whereas the c value is insensitive to temperature. This is because the lateral
dimensions (a and b) are influenced
by interchain interactions of weak vdW interactions. The variation
in the c dimension must be accompanied by changes
in bond length and bond angle of the extended all-trans PE chain and
hence needs a much larger energy.

Inasmuch
as the DFT-D calculations here reflect the electronic
structure at 0 K, it is preferable that the optimized crystal structures
should be compared with those at extremely low temperatures. Therefore,
the reliability of the DFT-D computations was checked by the RMSD
value for the lattice constants at 10, 4, and 4.5 K.41−43 The RMSD values of the set 0 (without the dispersion force correction),
I, II, and III calculations were calculated with eq 11 to be 28, 12, 3, and below 2%,
respectively. Compared with the c value, the a and b lengths are largely dependent on
the employed parameter set. This is because, as mentioned above, the
dispersion force correction influences the lateral dimensions via
the interchain interactions. As shown in Table 2, the set III parameters gave the minimum
RMSD and, furthermore, satisfactorily reproduced the atomic coordinates
determined by neutron diffraction at 10 and 4 K. The setting angle
(45.5°), namely, the angle formed between the molecular plane
and the b axis was also in good agreement with those
at 10 K (45.07°)41 and 4.5 K (45.5°).43 On this basis, the results from the set III
calculation will be exclusively referred to in the following discussion.
The stiffness and compliance tensors are as follows 3   4  

From the compliance tensor, the crystalline moduli (Ea, Eb, and Ec) and
linear compressibilities (βa, βb, and βc) in the a, b, and c axis directions and volume compressibility (βv)
of the PE crystal at 0 K were derived as shown in Table 3. For the mechanical properties obtained from all the parameter
sets, see Table S1 (Appendix A, Supporting
Information). Fortunately, we can find a number of the experimental
and theoretical data on PE crystals. The experiment methods to obtain
the mechanical properties are classified into X-ray diffraction, Raman
spectroscopy, and neutron inelastic scattering. The X-ray method was
already outlined in the Introduction. By this
method, for example, Clements et al.44 reported
the E∥ values of PE at room temperature
and at −165 °C as 150 and 255 GPa, respectively. The sizable
temperature dependence was explained as follows.35 The ratio of the observed modulus Ecrystapp to the crystalline
modulus Ecryst may be expressed as 5  where χvc is the volume fraction
crystallinity and Eam is the amorphous
modulus. At high temperatures where Eam ≪ Ecryst, Ecrystapp/Ecryst ratio will approach χvc. At fully low temperatures, on the other hand, the amorphous region
becomes so rigid so as to enlarge Eam and
hence Ecrystapp will be close to Ecryst. Nakamae et al.5 measured
the E∥ values of various PE samples
such as ultramodulus, linear low-density, high-pressure-crystallized,
and heat-drawn PEs and, consequently, obtained the same E∥ values of 235 GPa at room temperature and 254
GPa at −155 °C. The latter E∥ value exactly agrees with that (255 GPa at −165 °C)
of Clements et al.44 On this basis, they
have concluded that the assumption of homogeneous stress distribution
should be well founded. Matsuo and Sawatari45 have also argued that the homogeneous stress hypothesis should be
valid because the E∥ values that
they observed from PE were 213–229 GPa at 20 °C and virtually
independent of the elongation ratio. McCullough1 estimated Young’s modulus (as 2.8 GPa) of the isotropic
amorphous region of PE from the shear modulus and Poisson’s
ratio.46 On the basis of these data, the
homogeneous stress model implies that the strain of the amorphous
component would be about 90 (=254/2.8) times as much as that of the
crystalline region.

a Ea, Eb, and Ec are Young’s
moduli parallel to the a, b, and c axes, respectively. When the data are not given explicitly
in the literature, Young’s moduli were calculated from the
compliance tensor.

b βa, βb, and
βc are, respectively, the linear
compressibilities in the a, b, and c directions,
and βv is the volume compressibility. When the data
are not given explicitly in the literature, the compressibilities
were calculated from the compliance tensor:63 βa = s11 + s12 + s13, βb = s12 + s22 + s23, βc = s13 + s23 + s33, and βv = s11 + s22 + s33 + 2(s12 + s23 + s13).

c At room temperature.

The
Raman spectroscopic method is in principle based on the following
relation2 6  where ν is
the vibrational frequency
of the longitudinal acoustic mode (abbreviated as LAM) and L is the molecular length that can be estimated from the
long period (LLP) and volume fraction
crystallinity (χvc) according to L = χvcLLP.7 The LLP value is
determined from small-angle X-ray scattering. In early studies on n-paraffins with definite molecular lengths, comparatively
large E∥ values of 340 and 358
GPa were reported47,48 and afterward, smaller E∥ values of 260–315 GPa were evaluated
for PE crystals.8,49−51

Neutron
inelastic scattering (NIS) measurements provide phonon
frequencies and wave vectors simultaneously. The slope of the frequency
vs wave vector plot yields the sound velocity vx in the propagation direction (x) of the phonon52 7  where Ex is Young’s modulus
in the x direction.
This method has the advantage of informing us of both phonon frequency
and wave vector in a specific direction. Therefore, the crystalline
moduli along a, b, and c axes may be evaluated separately, whereas the Raman scattering yields
the unidirectional LAM, from which only the E∥ value can be derived. In an early study on NIS of
PE,52,53 the E∥ and E⊥ values at room temperature
were determined to be 329 and 6 GPa, respectively. In a later article,54 the Ea and Eb values
at −196 °C were reported as 9 and 8 GPa, respectively.
These data are larger than those estimated by X-ray diffraction (3.1
and 3.8 GPa). On the grounds that the LAM will not be perturbed by
the noncrystalline region, Fanconi and Rabolt7 have concluded that the crystalline moduli derived from NIS should
be the ultimate values and furthermore that the E∥ data obtained from X-ray diffraction are too
low. At least, the Raman and NIS methods have the decisive advantage
of selective observations only for the crystallites.

As a theoretical
approach, Odajima and Maeda55 conducted
lattice dynamics calculations for PE and derived
the crystalline moduli, as shown in Table 3. Wobser and Blasenbrey56 also calculated the crystalline moduli in a similar manner.
Odajima and Maeda used a Urey–Bradley force field for the intramolecular
interactions and intermolecular neighboring atom–atom interactions
without adapting the potential functions for the crystal structure,
in other words, under nonequilibrium conditions. On the other hand,
Wobser and Blasenbrey minimized the total energy using their own potential
functions and successfully reproduced the experimental crystal structure
(by Swan57) extrapolated to 0 K. Therefore,
McCullough1 suggested that the elastic
constants of Wobser and Blasenbrey should be more reliable.

The present DFT-D calculations (Ea = 10.9 GPa, Eb = 7.8 GPa, and Ec =
333 GPa) represent the ultimate mechanical properties of the perfect
PE crystal of infinite size at 0 K, thus being, naturally, superior
to any experimental observation. The crystalline moduli thus obtained
are in almost exact agreement with the theoretical values (Ea = 9.5 GPa, Eb = 8.6 GPa, and Ec = 324 GPa at −273 °C) of Wobser
and Blasenbrey56 and the NIS experimental
data (Ea = 9 GPa and Eb = 8 GPa at −196 °C
and Ec = 329 GPa at 20
°C)53,54 and also very close to the three-dimensional
normal coordinate calculations (Ea = 6.9 GPa, Eb = 8.6 GPa, and Ec =
316 GPa at 20 °C) of Tashiro et al.58 The MO calculations (from Dewar 1979 to Cochrane 2012 in Table 3),10−19 notwithstanding at different levels of theory with various basis
sets, yielded similar Ec (E∥) values of 300–400
GPa except 494 GPa of Dewar 1979.9 These
Young’s moduli are comparable to or consistent with our calculation
of 333 GPa.

Both theoretical and experimental values of βa and βb are much
larger than βc because the PE crystal
is weak (deformable) under external pressure applied in the lateral
directions. However, the above-mentioned theoretical calculations
yielded similar βc values between
the two X-ray experiments (1.3 and 3.1 GPa by Ito59,60): 2.1 TPa–1 (this study), 2.1 TPa–1 (Wobser and Blasenbrey56), and 2.4 TPa–1 (Tashiro et al.58).

parallel to the molecular plane.

Aromatic Polyesters
This section
deals with three aromatic
polyesters, PET, PTT, and PBT (α form). For all of the polyesters,
the structural optimizations were carried out with the set 0 (without
the dispersion force correction), I, II, and III parameters (the results
are compared in Table S2, Appendix A, Supporting
Information). The set III parameters have most satisfactorily represented
all of the crystal structures treated here. The principal difference
between sets I–III consists in the van der Waals (vdW) radii
used. In set III, the vdW radii of heavy atoms except hydrogen were
selected from the Bondi table,64 which
is a list vdW radii determined from X-ray diffraction data so as to
reproduce crystal densities at 0 K, gas kinetic collision cross sections,
critical densities, and liquid-state properties. As far as the polymer
crystals are concerned, the empirical vdW radii seem to match the
Grimme expression.

Therefore, the set III results are mainly
discussed here. Figure 3 shows the ac projections of the optimized crystal
structures, and Table 4 compares the calculated and observed lattice constants. For the
atomic coordinates, see Tables S5–S7 (Appendix B, Supporting Information). The agreement between theory
and experiment seems to be satisfactory in every case. It is known
that the α form of PBT reversibly changes to the so-called β
form under elongation.30−32,65 Accordingly, the β
form is regarded as a nonequilibrium structure, from which the crystalline
moduli cannot be derived with eq 17. For this reason, this article does not deal with
the β form of PBT.

In the crystalline state, the O–CH2–CH2–O part (referred hereafter to
as spacer) of PET adopts
the all-trans conformation; however, the ϕ1 angle
around the O–CH2 bond is somewhat shifted from the
normal value (∼180°) to 141.9°, which is intermediate
between the two experimental values (159 and 126.0°).20,66 For the ϕ angles, see Figure 4. The most stable conformation of the PET spacer was
proved to be trans–gauche–trans.21 However, the interchain π/π attraction between
the benzene rings renders the spacer all-trans. In a previous study,
Galimberti and Milani67 determined the
crystal structure of PTT at the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p) level: a = 4.39 Å, b = 6.54 Å, c = 18.38 Å, α = 101.0°, β = 90.0°,
γ = 116.5°, ϕ1 = −164°, ϕ2 = −58°, ϕ3 = −67°,
and ϕ4 = −172°. Slight differences between
their data and ours would be allowances of the structural optimization.
The ϕ angles show that the spacers of PTT and PBT lie in a trans–gauche–gauche–trans
and a gauche+–gauche+–trans–gauche––gauche– conformations, respectively.
Both conformations are not the most stable but likely to exist in
the solutions and melts.68,69

The crystalline moduli were calculated with the sets
0–III
parameters, and the results are listed in Table S3 (Appendix A, Supporting Information). Only the stiffness
and compliance tensors from set III are presented in Appendix C (Supporting Information). From the compliance
tensors, the crystalline moduli (Ea, Eb, and Ec) in the a, b, and c axis directions were
calculated with eq 16 and are compared with the experiment in Table 5. It should be emphasized again that the
calculated moduli correspond to the ultimate values at 0 K and would
be larger than any experimental data. All of the experimental data
in Table 5 were obtained
by the X-ray diffraction method. Especially for PET, a number of the
data have been reported but they are considerably scattered. The Ec (E∥) modulus can also be found to depend largely on crystallinity; for
example, Sakurada et al.62,70 reported two different
data: 75 GPa (crystallinity χc, 39.5%) and 108 GPa
(64.5%).

c In most X-ray
diffraction experiments
on PET and PBT, the modulus in the [1̅0 5] (PET) or [1̅
0 4] (PBT) direction has been substituted for Ec. As for PTT, the (002) diffraction was used.3

The Ec value of PTT
was calculated here to be as small as 7.1 GPa and comparable to an
experimental value of 5.39 GPa at −255 °C,3 and the X-ray data depend on temperature: 2.59 GPa at 27
°C. Interestingly, the Ec value of PTT is smaller than Eb in both DFT-D calculation and X-ray experiment.
The Ec magnitude of PBT
was calculated to be 20.8 GPa, whereas the experimental E∥ value was reported as 13.2 GPa.71 Nevertheless, both DFT-D and X-ray data on the three polyesters
give a similar relation between Ec (E∥) and spacer conformation;
the all-trans spacer of PET20 exhibits
the large E∥ value, whereas the
distorted ones of PTT (tggt)28,29 and PBT (g+g+tg–g–)30−32 show the much smaller moduli (see Figure 3). Nishino et al.3 have suggested that PTT has the smallest Ec of all polymers investigated so far.

For the lateral crystalline moduli of the three polyesters, the
DFT-D calculations show a common tendency of Ea < Eb, whereas the experiments have yielded Ea ≥ Eb. In the PET crystal, for example, the benzene rings
are stacked in the a axis direction (Figure 3); therefore, the soft π/π
attraction is formed in this direction, whereas in the b axis direction, hard steric repulsions will act. Accordingly, the
relation Ea < Eb seems to be more acceptable.

Conclusions
Crystalline moduli of representative polymers,
PMO, PE, PET, PTT,
and PBT, were calculated by the density functional theory at the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p)
level under periodic boundary conditions. The dispersion force correction
formulated by Grimme83,84 was investigated with different
parameter sets. As a result, the parameters proposed by Milani et
al.85,86 most satisfactorily reproduced all of the
experimental structures. The calculated E∥ (114 GPa) value of PMO is comparable to that (100 GPa) of the PMO
whisker34 and that (105 GPa) observed at
−150 °C from a highly oriented PMO film.35 The calculated Ec value (333
GPa) of PE falls within the range of those (260–358 GPa) derived
from Raman spectroscopy8,47−50 and exactly agrees with that
(329 GPa) determined by neutron inelastic scattering52,53 but is much larger than those (235–255 GPa) estimated by
X-ray diffraction.5,44,45 The DFT-D calculations on the aromatic polyesters yielded the following Ec values: 182 GPa (PET), 7.1 GPa (PTT), and
20.8 GPa (PBT). These magnitudes are approximately 1.3–1.7
times as large as X-ray diffraction data,3,62,70,71,76,78,79 whereas the tendency of PET ≫ PBT > PTT in Ec is fully consistent to that found for
the X-ray data. Inasmuch as the crystalline moduli obtained from X-ray
diffraction depend greatly on crystallinity62,70 and temperature,3,35,44 the X-ray data must be significantly perturbed by the amorphous
phase. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the homogeneous
stress model4,5 presupposed in the X-ray experiments
would be a coarse approximation except when highly crystalline samples
are measured at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, the X-ray method
should be still a convenient and useful tool to estimate mechanical
properties of polymer crystals. This study has also shown that the E∥ value depends largely on the conformation
of the polymeric chain: all-trans (PE, 333 GPa and PET, 182 GPa) >
helical (PMO, 114 GPa) > g+g+tg–g– (PBT, 20.8 GPa) > tggt (PTT, 7.1 GPa). Interestingly,
even in the crystalline state, both structures and properties of polymers
are strongly influenced by the conformational characteristics.

Methods
Optimization
of Crystal Structure
Density functional
theory calculations under periodic boundary conditions were conducted
with the CRYSTAL14 code.22,23 The lattice constants
and atomic coordinates determined mainly by X-ray diffraction were
set as the initial structure and fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level with the dispersion force correction to be described below,
and the computational conditions were typically as follows: self-consistent
field (SCF) convergence threshold, 10–7; truncation
criteria for bielectronic integrals, 10–7, 10–7, 10–7, 10–7,
and 10–14; integration grid, 55 radial and 434 angular
points; Fock/Kohn–Sham matrix mixing, 80% (with the modified
Broyden method);23 shrinking factor, 4.
The optimized crystal structures (Figures 1–3) were depicted
by Mercury CDC 3.9 program.87

Dispersion
Force Correction
Mean-field electronic structure
methods such as the Hartree–Fock and Kohn–Sham DFT theories
include no long-range electronic correlation effects, thus being unable
to represent the so-called London dispersion interactions. To improve
the DFT calculations (EDFT), a variety
of tools for dispersion force corrections have been developed.88 For instance, Grimme83,84 has proposed the DFT-D calculation by introducing a correction term
(Edisp) 8  The Edisp term
is expressed as 9  where s6 is the
global scaling factor, Nat is the number
of atoms included in the system, C6ij is the dispersion
coefficient for atom pair ij, given by C6ij = (C6iC6j)1/2, and Rij is the distance between atoms i and j. Here, the damping factor is defined as 10  where d represents the steepness
of the damping function and Rr is the
sum of van der Waals radii (RvdW) of atoms i and j. We have adopted three sets of
dispersion force parameters (Table 6), applied them to the structural optimization, and
compared the resultant lattice constants with the experimental data.
The agreement with experiment was checked by the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) 11  or the standard deviation, σ,
defined
as σ = RMSD/√N (%), where x represents lattice constant (a, b, c, α, β, or γ, dependent on
the crystal system) and N is the number of lattice
constants. As stated in the Introduction,
inasmuch as the experimental crystalline moduli are scattered and
hence the comparison with the experimental moduli does not always
prove the reliability of the calculation, instead, the validity of
the parameter sets has been checked by comparison with experiment
in lattice constants throughout this study.

Recently, a modification of the above DFT-D method, the so-called
D3 approach,88 has been developed. As far
as polymer crystals are concerned, however, the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p)
calculations have been extensively used and yielded favorable results
if combined with the parameter set suitable for the dispersion force
correction.67,85,86 Thus, this study has employed the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p) calculations
exclusively.

Crystal Elasticity63
The
stress tensor is defined as 12  Inasmuch as the stress tensor is a symmetric
matrix, only six elements are irreducible and numerically designated
according to Voigt’s notation: 1 = xx, 2 = yy, 3 = zz, 4 = yz, 5= xz, and 6 = xy. Then, the stress σ
and strain ϵ are expressed as 6 × 1 column vectors and
σ is related to ϵ through the stiffness tensor C by 13  where 14  The
stiffness tensor is a 6 × 6 matrix
with 21 independent elements. The crystal symmetry further simplifies
the C tensor. The compliance tensor S is related to the ϵ and σ vectors by ϵ = Sσ; therefore, S is the inverse matrix
of C, being represented as 15  Young’s
moduli in the x, y, and z directions (Ex, Ey, and Ez) are given by Ex = s11–1, Ey = s22–1, and Ez = s33–1, respectively. Young’s
modulus E(l1, l2, l3) in an arbitrary
direction represented with the unit
vector (l1, l2, l3) can be calculated from 16  

The element cuv (u and v = 1–6, Voigt’s
notation) of the stiffness tensor can
be calculated from 17  where ϵ is the rank-2 symmetric tensor
of pure strain and Ecryst and V are the total energy and volume per crystal cell, respectively.

The stiffness and compliance tensors were calculated with the ELASTCON
routine90,91 included in CRYSTAL14 code. The typical
conditions were as follows. The SCF convergence criterion was 10–8, the number of points for calculation of the numerical
second derivative was 5, and the strain-step size along a given deformation
was 0.005.
