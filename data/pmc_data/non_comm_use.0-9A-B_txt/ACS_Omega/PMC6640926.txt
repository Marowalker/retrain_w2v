The Ullmann homocoupling
of 2-bromo-perylene diimides (PDIs) gave
[2,2′-biperylene]-3,4:9,10:3′,4′:9′,10′-tetrakis(dicarboximide)s,
2,2′-bi(PDI)s, and the Suzuki coupling of a PDI-2-boronic ester
and a 1-bromo-PDI gave a [1,2′-biperylene]-3,4:9,10:3′,4′:9′,10′-tetrakis(dicarboximide),
1,2′-bi(PDI). These were compared with [1,1′-biperylene]-3,4:9,10:3′,4′:9′,10′-tetrakis(dicarboximide)s,
1,1′-bi(PDI)s. Solution absorption spectra suggest that the
PDIs in 2,2′-bi(PDI)s are more planar and less strongly coupled
than those in 1,1′-bi(PDI)s, which is consistent with density
functional theory calculations. 2,2′-Bi(PDI)s are less easily
reduced than 1,1′- and 1,2′-bi(PDI)s by ca. 70–90
mV. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells incorporating a 2,2′-bi(PDI)
acceptor behaved similarly to those employing its 1,1′-bi(PDI)
analogue.

Introduction
Perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide)s
(perylene diimides, PDIs)
have attracted interest as dyes and pigments, electron-transporting
semiconductors in organic field-effect transistors, two-photon-absorbing
chromophores, fluorophores, and acceptors in photoinduced electron-transfer
reactions for both fundamental studies and optical limiting.1−4 They have also been extensively used as light-harvesting electron-transporting
materials in organic solar cells;2,3,5 indeed, the first donor–acceptor organic solar
cell used a PDI-like acceptor in a bilayer heterojunction with copper
phthalocyanine.6 A wide range of PDI architectures
have been used in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics
(OPV), including simple small molecules,7 molecules with bulky 1,7-substituents to hinder aggregation,8 molecules that form columnar discotic liquid–crystal
phases,9 and conjugated10 and side-chain11 polymers. Nonfullerene
acceptors for solar cells are still an active subject of research,12−18 and PDIs remain one of the major classes under investigation.5 Many of the most efficient examples have three-dimensional
(3D) architectures, whereby two or more PDIs are forced out of plane
with one another and/or a bridging group.19 One simple approach to such 3D structures is to directly link two
PDIs through their “bay” (1,1′) positions (see Figure S1 for the numbering scheme for PDIs),
with the PDI units being sterically precluded from achieving coplanarity.
A variety of 1,1′-bi(PDI)s, Ia–j, have
been reported (Figure 1). Delocalization in Ia•– was investigated,20 and excitonic
coupling and electron/energy transfer were studied in Ib,21 but most studies focused on BHJ OPV.22−32a The precursors are generally 1-bromo-PDIs,
which are obtained by electrophilic substitution.1,3 2-Functionalized-PDIs
have recently become accessible through transition metal catalysis33−37 and been used to synthesize PDI-bridge-PDI species V–VII (Figure 1), whose physical and/or OPV properties have been compared
to those of 1-bromo-PDI-derived analogues II–IV.38,39 However, 2,2′-bi(PDI)s
have not yet been reported.b Here, we report
2,2′-bi(PDI)s (3a and 3b, Scheme 1) and a 1,2′-bi(PDI)
(2a) and compare their absorption spectra and electrochemistry
to those of 1,1′-bi(PDI)s (1a and 1b). We also compare the OPV performance of 2,2′-bi(PDI) 3b to that of its 1,1′-linked analogue, 1b.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 1,1′-, 1,2′-, and 2,2′-bi(PDI)s
Pin = pinacolate; cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene.

Results and Discussion
Scheme 1 shows the
synthesis of 1, 2, and 3. Previously
reported 1b (Ic)22 was made in a similar way to other 1,1′-Bi(PDI)s,20−22,25,28,29 that is, by the Ullmann homocoupling of S2b(22,40) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
(but with added toluene to improve solubility). Boronic esters (S3) were synthesized using the previously described conditions,35,38,41 and, without purification or
characterization, they were treated with CuBr2 to yield
2-Br-PDIs (S4),37 which were
converted to 2,2′-PDIs (3) using Ullmann conditions
similar to those used for 1,1′-PDIs. Boronic ester S3a was also subjected to Suzuki coupling conditions with S2a to obtain 1,2′-bi(PDI) (2a). The new dimers
were all characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy,
mass spectrometry, and combustion analysis. Although several of the
derivatives show broadened 1H and/or 13C spectra,
likely as a result of restricted rotation around the PDI–PDI
bond, especially in the case of 2,2′-isomers, and about the
N-alkyl bonds of the derivatives with CH(C5H11)2 chains (as seen for other PDIs with “swallowtail”
substituents42,43), the isomers can be readily
distinguished by NMR (see Experimental Section and spectra in the Supporting Information).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) (10 °C min–1, Figure S2) gave melting
points of 167,
188, and 275 °C for 1a, 2a, and 3a, respectively, all considerably higher than that of monomeric S1a (108 °C) under the same conditions. In contrast,
the bi(PDI)s with secondary alkyl substituents, 1b and 3b, showed no evidence of crystallinity, consistent with GIWAXS
measurements on 1b,30 but
exhibited glass transitions at 132 and 85 °C, respectively (Figure S3). The
decomposition temperatures (5 wt % loss, thermogravimetric analysis,
10 °C min–1), which vary slightly with linkage
motif, are similar to those of monomeric PDIs and are slightly lower
for compounds with secondary alkyl imide substituents than for those
with branched primary substituents (432, 432, 440, 420, 383, and 381
°C for 1a, 2a, 3a, S1a, 1b, and 3b, respectively).

Density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP/6-31G**) calculations for 1c, 2c, and 3c (in which the N,N′-dialkyl groups are simplified
to CH3, Scheme 1) provide insight into their conformations and energetics.
The two PDI units are severely twisted relative to one another, which
is consistent with the previous calculations for 1,1′-bi(PDI)s;20,25,28 ψ, the CH–C–C–CH
torsion angle across the PDI–PDI bond, increases from 1,1′-
to 1,2′- and 2,2′-linkages (Figure 2, Table 1). On the other hand, the two naphthalene subunits
of the bay-substituted PDIs of 1c and 2c are somewhat twisted from coplanarity (as quantified by ϕ),
whereas the ortho-functionalized PDIs of 2c and 3c are virtually planar. Twisted cores are often found for
bay-substituted PDIs, even with medium-sized substituents, and they
help relieve steric interactions between the 1-substituent and the
hydrogen or other substituent in the 12-position.44−46 However, steric
interaction between 2-substituents and the 3-oxo-group cannot be relieved
by an intra-PDI twist, ϕ, and hence results in a larger inter-PDI
twist, ψ. Similar differences in bridge/PDI twists and intra-PDI
distortion were seen between bay- and ortho-linked II and V.38

and 2-substituted PDIs, respectively.

Frontier molecular orbitals for 1c–3c were also calculated (DFT, B3LYP/6-31**); the wavefunctions
and
energies for 1c are similar to those previously reported
for Ia.20 The LUMO and LUMO
+ 1 of the symmetric bi(PDI)s (1c and 3c) are bonding and antibonding combinations, respectively, of two
PDI LUMOs (see Table S2). The LUMO/LUMO
+ 1 energetic separation (Table 1) is much smaller for 3c than that for 1c; this can be attributed to the larger ψ in 3c, which reduces the inter-PDI π-overlap, and to the
ortho positions of PDIs having smaller LUMO coefficients than the
bay positions. Similarly, HOMO and HOMO – 1 resemble, respectively,
antibonding and bonding combinations of two PDI HOMOs; again, a larger
separation is seen for 1c. The large LUMO/LUMO + 1 and
HOMO/HOMO – 1 separations seen for 2c are partly
due to its inherent asymmetry; the LUMO and HOMO – 1 are localized
on the ortho-substituted PDI, whereas the LUMO + 1 and HOMO are localized
on the bay-substituted PDI.

Figure 3 compares
solution absorption spectra of 1a–3a and S1a (Figure S4 shows
spectra of 1b and 3b, which are very similar
to those of their analogues). Spectra for 1a,b are consistent with previous reports on 1,1′-bi(PDI)s20−22 and are considerably broader and more complex than those of monomeric
PDIs, such as S1a, with lower peak absorptivities (εmax). The broadening and consequent lowering of εmax are partially attributed to the nonplanarity of the PDI
units;44,45 however, inter-PDI electronic coupling helps
to determine the vibrational structure.21 Spectra of 3a,b more closely resemble
those of monomeric PDIs, suggesting the PDI units of 2,2′-bi(PDI)s
are more planar and less strongly coupled than those of 1,1′-bi(PDI)s,
consistent with DFT results (see above). The differences in the linewidth
and absorptivity seen here between 1,1′- and 2,2′-PDIs
are reminiscent of those previously seen for the PDI-based transitions
of II and V, although the additional complexity
attributable to PDI–PDI coupling for 1a,b is not seen for II.38c Finally, the spectrum of 2a is
quite similar to that of 3a, but with a lower εmax and broadened vibronic sub-bands, consistent with the superposition
of the spectra of a planar (ortho-substituted) and less planar (bay-substituted)
PDI and with small coupling. Despite a large variation in εmax, the oscillator strengths of the main PDI-like bands are
similar for all three linkages and only a little less than twice those
of S1a (Table 2).

PDI–PDI π–π
interactions typically result
in a retained vibronic structure but a decreased ratio of the absorbances
of 0,0 to 0,1 sub-bands.47 Thus, spectra
of bi(PDI) thin films (Figure 3) can be understood as resulting from the effects of the planarity
and through-bond electronic coupling responsible for the solution
spectra and these intermolecular interactions. The
variation in π–π interactions between bi(PDI)s
with different connectivities cannot be easily gauged because of the
variation of the solution spectra. However, these effects are more
pronounced for the branched primary alkyl derivatives, 1a and 3a, than for their secondary alkyl analogues, 1b and 3b, consistent with the trends for monomeric
PDIs7 and indicating a more disrupted π-stacking
when the alkyl branching is immediately adjacent to the nitrogen atoms.
The effects of π–π interactions appear to be less
severe for the bi(PDI)s than for monomeric PDIs (see Figure S4 and spectra of secondary alkyl PDIs in ref (7)).

Monomeric PDIs
show two successive reversible one-electron reductions.
The bi(PDI)s show four solution reductions (Table 2, Figures 3 and S5), consistent with
other 1,1′-bi(PDI)s.20−22,26,28,32 Splittings
between redox potentials in compounds with linked equivalent redox
centers result from an interplay of effects, including electronic
coupling in the mixed-valence species, solvent-mediated Coulombic
effects, and through-bond inductive effects.48 Here, electronic coupling is likely weak: the absorption spectrum
of Ia•– indicates
that the excess electron is localized on one PDI unit and the coupling
is small,20 and the DFT LUMO/LUMO + 1 splittings
(Table 1) suggest an
even weaker coupling in 2,2′-bi(PDI)s.d For 1,2′-bi(PDI) (2a), the inequivalence of
the two PDIs may also contribute to the electrochemical splitting.

The first reduction potentials of the bi(PDI)s are similar to one
another and to that of S1a; however, both the 1,1′-
and 1,2′-bi(PDI)s (1a,b and 2a, respectively) are somewhat more readily reduced than the
2,2′ dimers (3a,b), consistent with
the DFT LUMO energies (Table 1), or than S1a. The differences between 1a,b and 3a,b may be
due to the effects of not only planarity but also differences in the
inductive and electronic coupling effects of the linkage motifs. The
potential of 2a is close to that of 1a,
which might suggest its bay-linked PDI that is reduced first; however,
DFT indicates that the LUMO of 2a is localized on the
ortho-linked PDI (Table S2), perhaps suggesting
that PDI is a more effective inductively electron-withdrawing group
through its bay position.

The feasibility of using 2,2′-bi(PDI)s
as nonfullerene acceptors
in BHJ OPVs was investigated using “inverted” devices
with the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PTB7-Th:bi(PDI)/MoO3/Ag. We compared 1b and 3b because
(a) 1b (Ic) has been used as a nonfullerene
acceptor in previous studies22−24,26,27,30 and (b) monomeric
PDIs with secondary alkyl substituents often give more favorable morphologies
and better performance than those with linear or branched primary
alkyl groups.7 The device structure and
the donor polymer, PTB7-Th (also known as PCE10 and PBDTT-F-TT),49 were selected on the basis of their previous
use with 1b (Ic), which gave an optimized
power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3% (even higher with a surface
modifier applied to ZnO);24 the same PTB7-Th:1b ratio and additives afforded very similar device parameters
in our experiment (Table 3, Figure 4).
With 3b as acceptor, the same ratios, additives, and
processing gave PCE = 4.8%. However, varying the donor/acceptor ratios
and additives led to PCE values close to those for PTB7-Th:1b devices (Table 3;
see Supporting Information for additional
characterization of blends and devices). The similarity in the behavior
of the optimized blends is consistent with similar EQE spectra (Figure 4), where, at least
for the additive-containing films, the acceptor and donor contributions
increase and decrease, respectively, for 3b versus 1b films, consistent with a higher acceptor content of the
films. The similarity in behavior is also consistent with a fairly
small difference in the electron mobility of the blend films (5.0
× 10–5 and 2.2 × 10–5 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively,
for the 1b and 3b optimized blends; see Figure S8). AFM also suggests similar surface
morphologies, although phase images indicate somewhat larger feature
sizes for optimized 3b blends (Figure S7). Overall, at least with PTB7-Th, the 2,2′-bi(PDI)
offers no clear advantage over its 1,1′ analogue. However,
different optimum donor/acceptor/additive compositions found for the
two bi(PDI)s indicates they are not interchangeable and suggests that
which performs best may vary from system to system.

Conclusions
1,1′-,
1,2′-, and 2,2′-bi(PDI)s differ subtly
in their solution absorption spectra and electrochemistry; these changes
are consistent with DFT geometries and frontier orbital energies.
However, solid-state spectra are more strongly dependent on the nature
of the N,N′-substituents.
A 2,2′-bi(PDI) has been shown to act as a nonfullerene acceptor
in BHJ solar cells, and it exhibits a similar performance to its 1,1′
analogue, albeit with a different optimum active-layer composition,
indicating the 2,2′-bi(PDI) moiety is also a viable building
block for nonfullerene acceptors.

General
Synthesis and Characterization
Chromatographic
separations were performed with standard flash column chromatography
methods using silica gel purchased from Sorbent Technologies (60 Å,
40–63 μm). Electrochemical measurements were carried
out under nitrogen in dry deoxygenated 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in THF using a conventional three-electrode
cell with a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter
electrode, and a Ag wire coated with AgCl as the pseudoreference electrode.
Potentials were referenced by using ferrocenium/ferrocene as an internal
reference. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 50
mV s–1.

1-Bromo-N,N′-di(2-decyltetradecyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide), S2a
This compound was previously reported in ref (50) but its synthesis and
characterization were not. An alternative preparation involving imidization
of a mixture of brominated perylene dianhydrides was reported in ref (51); the characterizing data
in ref (51) are consistent
with those reported below. N,N′-Di(2-decyltetradecyl)perylene-3,4:9,10-bis(dicarboximide), S1a,52 (6.0 g, 5.6 mmol), K2CO3 (4.0 g, 29 mmol), and chlorobenzene (80 mL)
were mixed in a 200 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser.
Bromine (4.8 mL, 93 mmol) in chlorobenzene (10 mL) was added dropwise.
The reaction mixture was then heated to 60 °C and kept overnight
before it was cooled to room temperature and poured into a saturated
Na2S2O3 solution (500 mL). The mixture
was extracted with CHCl3 (2 × 200 mL), and the organic
phase was washed with water (2 × 100 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. After the solvent was removed, the residue
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, with CHCl3/hexane (1:1) as the eluent. After the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure, S2a was obtained as a red solid

mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with dichloromethane

over MgSO4. After filtration and evaporation of the solvents,
the crude product was purified by column chromatography (silica gel;

A solution of S1a(52) (2.0 g, 1.9 mmol), tris(pentafluorophenyl)phosphine (0.12
g, 0.23 mmol), and bis(pinacolato)diboron (0.57 g, 1.9 mmol) in anhydrous
1,4-dioxane (50 mL) was deoxygenated with argon for 30 min, and then
(Ir(OMe)cod)2 {cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene} (0.037 g, 0.056
mmol) was added to a reaction vessel. The resulting mixture was heated
to reflux for 24 h, allowed to cool to room temperature, and evaporated
under reduced pressure to yield crude S3a. For use in
the Suzuki coupling with S2a to afford 2a (see below), the crude product was purified by column chromatography
(silica gel; 2:1 to 10:1 dichloromethane/hexane) to afford S2a containing minor impurities (0.23 g, 19% yield if pure), which was
used in the subsequent Suzuki coupling reactions without additional
purification. For conversion to S4a, crude S3a (1.8 g) (including some unreacted starting material and catalyst)
was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (35 mL); to the resulting red solution,
methanol (5 mL) and aqueous CuBr2 (1.68 g in 2 mL of water)
were added, and the resulting mixture was heated at 120 °C in
a sealed tube. After the conversion was complete (ca. 12 h, monitored
using thin-layer chromatography (TLC)), the product was extracted
with dichloromethane. The extracts were washed with water, dried over
MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure.
The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography (silica
gel; 3:2 to 5:1 dichloromethane/hexane) to give S4a as
a red solid (0.626 g, 78% over two steps from S1a). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.34 (d, J = 8 Hz, 2H), 8.29 (d, J = 8 Hz, 1H),

A solution of K2CO3 (0.087
g, 0.63 mmol) in water (6 mL) was added to a solution of S3a (0.32 g, 0.27mmol) and S2a (0.24 g, 0.21 mmol) in a
mixture of toluene (60 mL) and EtOH (0.8 mL); after deoxygenation
by bubbling with argon for 30 min, Pd(PPh3)4 (0.026 g, 0.022 mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was heated
to 80 °C under argon overnight. After the conversion of the starting
material (according to TLC) was complete, the product was extracted
with dichloromethane. The organic phase was washed with water, dried
over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure.
The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel; 3:1

Solar-Cell Fabrication and Testing
ITO-coated glass
substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent (sodium dodecyl
sulfate), deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in successive
steps. The substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 10 min
before use. A thin layer of sol–gel ZnO (ca. 10 nm) was spin-coated
onto precleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 4000 rpm and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min
in air. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Zn(OAc)2·2H2O and ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol
and then stirred overnight. A 24 mg/mL total concentration solution
of PTB7-Th and the relevant bi(PDI) in chlorobenzene with different
mass ratios and additive concentrations was spin-cast on ZnO layer
in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. At the final stage, the substrates
were transferred to high vacuum, and MoO3 (10 nm) topped
with silver (100 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer.
The active area defined by shadow masks was 0.1 cm2. The
current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic
devices were measured in the glovebox using a Keithley 2400 source
meter. A xenon arc lamp (300 W) was used as the light source, the
intensity of which was calibrated using a KG5-filtered Si cell. The
solar-cell performance was measured using an Air Mass 1.5 G solar
simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW/cm2.
The thickness of films was measured by a KLA-Tencor P-15 profiler.

DFT Calculations
DFT calculations were carried out
using the B3LYP functional,54 which combines
Becke’s three-parameter hybrid-exchange functional55 with the Lee–Yang–Parr correlation
functional,56 and the 6-31G** basis set
as implemented within the Spartan’14 package.57 Frequency calculations on the optimized geometries indicated
no imaginary frequencies.

a In addition to the compounds shown
in Figure 1, halo-substituted derivatives have been reported as precursors
to Ig–i but have not been studied
extensively spectroscopically and electrochemically or in devices.28,32

b 1,1′-Bi(PDIs) have,
however,
been compared as OPV acceptors with analogues with direct N,N′-links.26,27

c Comparisons between the
spectra of III, IV and VI, VII are complicated by the effects of aggregation, even in
a dilute
solution.39

d Electronic coupling (V) in a localized
mixed-valence monoanion is given by   where the orbital energies refer to the corresponding
neutral species, assuming (i) Koopmans’ theorem and (ii) that
the neutral geometry is a good approximation to that of the monoanion
at the symmetric transition state, which connects the two unsymmetrical
minima.

e Expected JSC values obtained from convolution of the four EQE spectra
shown in
Figure 4 with the AM1.5 spectrum are 12.4, 13.1, 11.4, and 12.4 mA
cm–2, roughly consistent with the values obtained
by J–V measurements (note
that the values given in Table 3 are averages over eight devices).
