Fe/Ti-layered double
hydroxide (LDH) has been hydrothermally prepared
and characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
and UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for evaluation
of its structure, morphology, and optical properties. The purpose
of doping Ti4+ with Fe3+ toward the synthesis
of Fe/Ti LDH is to extend the absorption of the nanomaterial to longer
wavelength, which is known to exhibit higher electron transport performance.
To provide a practical realization, electron transport modeling across
the band gap has been interpreted using exponential, Gaussian, and
mixed Gauss–exponential distribution. The conduction band energy
(EC) has been calculated by using the
observed values of band gap (Eg) and ξ-potential
of the LDH. A detailed study has been undertaken to investigate the
pattern of theoretical density of the LDH on the basis of unknown
(EC = 0) and known (calculated) values
of EC. Fermi–Dirac statistics has
been used extensively for estimating the occupancy probability of
electron (e–)–hole (h+) pair formation
within the valence and conduction bands, respectively, with different
temperatures, as well as for given energy levels. Monte Carlo simulations
have also been performed to evaluate the suitability of the choice
of the model, on the basis of the probability of availability of e–s within the conduction band. To provide a practical
realization of the suggested models, electronic transition across
the band gap of Fe/Ti LDH has been extensively investigated.

1 Introduction
The
electron transport phenomenon occurs with the excitation of
semiconductors by photons.1,2 The semiconducting properties
of layered nanomaterials have been widely explored due to their fast
mobility of charge carriers. The irradiation of semiconducting nanomaterials
by light having energy sizeable to the band gap energy of the nanomaterial
promotes e–s to the conduction band (CB), thereby
generating h+s within the VB 1  These generated e––h+ pairs may recombine, releasing
energy in the form of heat
resulting no chemical changes within the nanomaterial. Without recombination,
if the e–s and h+s move to the surface,
then the nanomaterial is expected to attain semiconducting property
and can participate in a variety of redox reactions with adsorbed
organic/inorganic molecular or ionic species. The redox reactions
taking place over the surface of the semiconducting nanomaterials
form the basis of photochemical reactions. The mechanism of e––h+ hopping conduction model for
basic semiconduction process is presented in Figure 1A. The usefulness of the semiconduction mechanism
could be demonstrated with the help of hVB+ within the catalyst surface that induces
oxidative decomposition of the material. The semiconductor materials
also exhibit catalytic activities due to effective e––h+ pair separation. The phenomenon of photosensitization
in a basic semiconductor nanomaterial is shown in Figure 1B.

e––h+ hopping conduction and (B)
photosensitization.

Layered double hydroxides
(LDHs) possess inorganic layered matrices,
generally represented as [M1–xIIMxIII(OH)2]x+(An)x/n·yH2O, where MII and MIII represent
di- and trivalent metal cations, respectively, and An– is a charge-balancing anion. LDHs comprise brucite-like
layers, having M2+ ions (e.g., Mg2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, or Zn2+) octahedrally coordinated by −OH groups and a fraction
(x) of M3+ ions (e.g., Al3+, Cr3+, Ga3+, In3+, Mn3+, Ti3+, or Fe3+) that isomorphously substitute
M2+ ions in brucite-like layers and, hence, result in positively
charged layers. The positively charged brucite layers are counterbalanced
by the interlayer anions (An–).
H2O molecules exist within the interlayer galleries. The
−OH groups are directed toward the interlayer spacing and may
have been engaged in H-bonding with H2O molecules as well
as with the anions. The relatively weak H-bonding between the brucite
layers enable LDHs to exhibit an expanding nature. LDHs are also considered
as doped semiconductors having compositional variability, and hence
they find extensive applicability as novel materials with efficient
photochemical functions.3−5 The semiconduction mechanism exhibited
by LDHs occurs as a result of the transfer of e–s from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). The purpose
of doping Ti4+ with Fe3+ toward the synthesis
of Fe/Ti LDH is to create band states, thereby favoring electronic
transition and resulting in narrowing the band gap, which is known
to exhibit higher photochemical performance. Moreover, Fe3+ also acts as a photogenerated electron trapper, since the energy
level for Fe3+ ions is above the valence band edge of Ti4+ ions, therefore inducing higher electron transport efficiency.
Fe3+ also possesses a stable half-filled (3d5) electronic configuration, and the trapped charge could easily transform
Fe3+ to Fe2+ and could also migrate to the surface
for participation in various photochemical reactions. The present
work portrays the synthesis of Fe/Ti LDH by a single-step hydrothermal
route and its characterization for evaluation of structure, morphology,
and optical properties. To provide a practical realization of electron
transport across Fe/Ti LDH, depending on the probability of availability
of e–s in the CB, theoretical modeling of e– transport across the band gap of the LDH has been
established using Gaussian, exponential, and mixed Gauss–exponential
distributions by adopting the Monte Carlo simulation procedure. The
electronic transition across the band gap of the LDH has been demonstrated
for realization of the suggested models.

2 Characterization
Results
2.1 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
XRD patterns confirmed the material to be Fe/Ti LDH (Figure 2). The strong reflection peaks
at (003), (006), (009), (110), (113), (100), (0111), (018), and (1013) represent the characteristic
hexagonal phase of LDHs.2−5

Figure 2 XRD spectrum of Fe/Ti LDH.

The d-spacing (d003) was 0.70 nm (2θ = 12.69°), consistent with the previous
reports of hexagonal phase LDHs with interlayer CO32– and H2O molecules. Since Fe/Ti LDH exhibited
similar layer thickness to normal LDHs, it is most likely that planar
orientation of anions has been exhibited mainly by CO32– and H2O molecules, in the interlayer gallery
of Fe/Ti LDH (Figure S1.1; Supporting Information).3,6 The incorporation of TiCl4 during the aqueous phase LDH
synthesis has generated TiO2 in its anatase phase, which
is evident from the (110) and (101) diffraction peaks present at 2θ
values of 27.99 and 33.20°, respectively, in the X-ray diffractogram
of Fe/Ti LDH. The existence of the characteristic peaks of Ti (anatase)
phase within the X-ray diffractogram further indicates the successful
doping of Ti within the synthesized LDH material. Moreover, TiO2, in anatase form, exhibits high charge transfer efficiency
and introduces defect states within the LDH.7,8 It
also helps in narrowing the band gap. The narrow and sharp diffraction
peaks indicate the existence of well-defined crystalline phases in
Fe/Ti LDH. The X-ray crystallographic parameters are discussed in S1 (Supporting Information).

2.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)–Energy-Dispersive
X-ray (EDX) Analysis
SEM and EDX mapping of the LDH sample
have been performed to have an insight into the morphology of the
LDH nanomaterial. The SEM image (Figure 3) confirmed the presence of ultrafine regular
hexagonal-shaped nanolayers stacked one over the other representing
the lamellar phase of LDH materials.3,10

Figure 3 SEM image of
Fe/Ti LDH.

The regular hexagonal particles
existed due to the subsequent crystallization
of LDH incorporated with simple interlayer anions and H2O molecules owing to hydrothermal treatment. The existence of distorted
hexagonal particles is most likely due to the ultrasonic treatment
of the sample prior to SEM imaging. The X-ray elemental maps of the
Fe/Ti LDH sample are presented in Figure 4. The Fe/Ti weight ratio by elemental mapping
was found to be 2.125:1, nearly equivalent to the stoichiometric ratio
of 2:1 Fe/Ti LDH (corresponding to the weight ratio Fe/Ti = 2.33:1)
of Fe and Ti taken during the hydrothermal synthesis.

and (B) overall selected area X-ray map along with % composition.
Regions of interest in X-ray maps of (C) C K, (D) O K, (E) S K, (F)
Ti K, and (G) Fe K.

The difference between
the stoichiometric weight and that detected
by X-ray elemental mapping could be due to the washing of the LDH
after hydrothermal synthesis. Further, the EDX analysis showed the
existence of a very little amount of S, which might be due to the
presence of impurities in the precursors used in the preparation of
LDH. The detection of C corresponds to the interlayer CO32– species (as observed in the Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) analysis) of the LDH, which appears to be due to
the use of urea as a basic precipitant in the LDH synthesis. The detection
of O corresponds to the −OH groups that stabilize the brucite
sheets and the CO32– ions and H2O present within the brucite sheets of Fe/Ti LDH. However, the mapping
does not indicate the presence of N and Cl as these elements transform
to form NH3 and NH4Cl during the hydrothermal
synthesis (in which urea and TiCl4 are used as precursors)
and were removed by washing the LDH sample.

2.3 AFM Analysis
Tapping noncontact AFM
has been used to investigate the morphology and the total thickness
along c-axis represented by the height profile. The
AFM image (Figure 5A) also confirms the existence of hexagonal platelets, consistent
with the SEM observations.9−11

Figure 5 (A) Three-dimensional (3D) AFM surface
topography, (B) two-dimensional
(2D) AFM surface topography, and (C) height profile of Fe/Ti LDH.

For AFM analysis, the LDH sample
has been dispersed in EtOH by
ultrasonication for ∼5 min so that the stacked hexagonal layers,
observed under scanning electron microscopy, get opened to single
hexagonal nanosheets or at least to two- to three-stacked hexagonal
nanosheet crystallites. Two slightly distorted hexagonal nanosheets
are clearly observed in the 3D and 2D height profile images (Figure 5A,B). The distortion
of hexagonal surfaces may occur due to the prolonged ultrasonication
process. The two height tracers reveal the average height of the nanosheets
to be ∼2 nm (Figure 5C), which corresponds to at least four stacked nanosheets
(Figure S1.1; Supporting Information).

The surface topography (Figure 5A) also reveals two crests and troughs, among which
two crests seemed to be very much prominent over the hexagonal sheets,
which is most likely due to the staking of the nanoparticles one over
the other, i.e., the growth of nanocrystal lattice in Z (or c) direction. The height profile reveals the
total height of the LDH sample to be ∼24 nm.

2.4 FT-IR Analysis
The FT-IR results
are found to be comparable to the LDHs containing interlayer anions
and H2O molecules (Figure 6). The broad IR band at 3467 cm–1 could be assigned to −OH stretching vibrations corresponding
to the surface −OH groups and interlayer H2O molecules
being observed at lower wavenumber in the LDH rather than assigned
for free H2O at 3600 cm–1. The shoulders
at 2973 and 2848 cm–1 might be due to the H-bonding
among the surface −OH groups, interlayer H2O, and
CO32– anions present in the LDH system.
The sharp peak at 1800 cm–1 appearing in the spectra
could be due to the C=Ostr vibrations, which correspond
to the existence of interlayer CO32– species.
The absorption band at 1635 cm–1 could be attributed
to the H–O–H bending vibrations. The bands at 1549 and
1125 cm–1 might be due to the asymmetric and symmetric
vibrations, respectively, i.e., C–Ostr vibrations
of CO32– species present in the system.
Moreover, the bands at 1418 cm–1 (ν3), 1187 cm–1 (ν1), and 1122 cm–1 (ν2) might also be due to the bending
vibrational modes of interlayer CO32– species and the band at 865 cm–1 might be due
to the in-plane quadrant bending vibration mode of CO32–. The bands at 720 and 614 cm–1 confirm
the presence of metal–hydroxyl (M–OH) and metal–oxygen
(M–O) groups associated with the Fe/Ti LDH.3,6−9 The existence of these IR bands indicates the successful preparation
of Fe/Ti LDH and the presence of CO32– and H2O molecules in its interlayer galleries.

of Fe/Ti LDH.

2.5 UV–Visible
Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
(UV–vis DRS) Analysis
UV–vis DRS was employed
for investigating the coordination state and nature of bonding of
Fe and Ti within the LDH (Figure 7). The strong absorption peak at ∼320 nm extending
up to 450 nm could be indexed to Fe(II) coordinated to CO32– within the interlayer galleries. A shoulder
starting at ∼455 nm and extending up to 650 nm is most likely
due to the presence of Tin+ within the
brucite sheets or may be a result of supramolecular guest–guest
or guest–host interactions.12−15 The band gap of the LDH has been
calculated using the Tauc equation3,6 from the UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectra 2  where Eg represents
the optical band gap, hν represents photon
energy, K is a constant, and n depends
on the nature of the transition. In fact, n assumes
values of , and 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden,
indirect allowed, and indirect forbidden transitions respectively.
In this case, the best fit of (αhν)1/n versus E (eV) was obtained
for , suggesting allowed
direct transitions
across the energy band gap. The extrapolated value (the straight line
to the X-axis) of hν at α
= 0 gives a band gap value of 2.65 eV for the LDH (Figure 7 (inset plot)). The narrow
band gap exhibits the LDH to possess remarkable semiconducting property.
Moreover, the band gap is most likely due to the direct electronic
transition from oxygen 2p to the metal ns or np levels. This also
suggests that e––h+ pairs could
be photogenerated within the LDH by irradiation with light of longer
wavelength. The narrow band gap of the LDH might also be due to the
gap states induced by Tin+ species, associated
with oxygen vacancies within the layered structure.

reflectance spectrum and Tauc plot (inset
plot) of Fe/Ti LDH.

3 Electron
Transport Modeling Across the Band
Gap of Fe/Ti LDH
An investigation into the electron transport
across the band gap
of the Fe/Ti LDH was done using the multielectron Monte Carlo simulation
procedure by incorporating the value of conduction band energy (EC) of Fe/Ti LDH (which, in turn, is calculated
using the value of direct band gap (Eg) (calculated using Tauc plot; obtained through UV–visible
DRS analysis)) to the energy density equation for determination of
theoretical energy density.

To understand the theoretical concept
of electron transport across
the semiconductor LDH, it is assumed that the defects/traps are uniformly
distributed in a cubic (100 × 100 × 100) box with periodic
boundary condition.16−22 The exponential distribution has been employed for interpretation
of electron transport across Fe/Ti LDH. Moreover, the electronic movement
across the LDH has also been interpreted by applying Gaussian and
mixed Gauss–exponential distribution for the first time in
this work. A comparative study of the theoretical models has also
been presented herein. The Monte Carlo procedure has been adopted
for providing the simulation-based realization of electron transport.
Therefore, a system is considered to possess N number
of electrons, where Nc and Nv denote the number of electrons in the CB and VB, respectively,
so that the total number of electrons is represented by 3  At a given temperature T (K),
the shifting of electrons from VB to CB depends upon the incident
energy on the LDH. The energy (eV) incorporated to the system is denoted
by E = ε at the prefixed temperature T. Let Nc(ε, t) (=N(ε)) represent the number of electrons
shifted from VB to CB. Consequently, the number of electrons remaining
in the VB at the same temperature would be Nv(ε) = N – Nc(ε) (from eq 3). The availability of Nc(ε)
electrons in the CB at a given temperature and energy ε is assumed
to follow a binomial distribution (N, pε), which is represented as 4  where pε denotes the probability that at energy
level ε in the CB would
be populated by at least one electron. Hence, the component (1 – pε) = qε denotes the probability of nonmovement electrons to CB from VB (which
is equivalent to the condition when no h+ ions are formed
in the VB). Hence, at the given energy level, the mean number of e–s, [E(Nc(ε))], transferred to CB at constant temperature and its variance, V(Nc(ε)), which was obtained
using eq 4, have been
presented herein as 5   6  Moreover, the occupancy of e– at
CB has been determined by the probability of transfer of at least
one e– from the VB to CB, at the energy level E = ε for the given fixed temperature T. The energy E = ε delivered to the system
is supposed to be divided into “m”
nonoverlapping equal subintervals, where m is considered
to be a positive integer, then each corresponding subinterval ΔE (=ε/m) could be assumed to be an
infinitesimally small energy level. The probability of transfer of
an e– to CB from VB in the energy interval ΔE would therefore be  and the probability of nontransfer would
be .22−26 The electron jump has been considered only when at
least one e– shifts from VB to CB in the jth energy
gap such that j = 1,2,...,m. According
to the law of total probability, the distribution of number of e– in the CB could be represented as 7  where PC represents
the nonoverlapping energy gap and also the sum of the probabilities
of the presence of e–s in the CB within the g energy gaps. In eq 6, “g” takes all integer values
in the interval [k, m], where k ≤ m. Therefore, considering the
different conditions, three formalized models are presented for interpretation
of e– transport27 across
Fe/Ti LDH.

Model 1: When m → ∞
(i.e., the energy
gap is sufficiently large) and pε → 0 (i.e., the probability of availability of electron in
CB is very small and hence Npε would
also be small), for minimum number of e–s at CB, k = 1. Hence, eq 7 has been approximated using Poisson distribution with parameter
(Npεε) as27 8  where Fexpo(ε)
represents the cumulative density function of exponential energy gap
with parameter Npε = 1/ε.

Model 2: When m is very large, i.e., m → ∞, but neither of pε*; where , and (1 – pε*) are close
to zero, the binomial distribution could be approximated by Gaussian
distribution with mean (μ) = mpε* and variance
σ2 = mpε*(1 – pε*). When m is very large and large energy gaps are expected to exist
within the LDH between the VB and the CB, eq 7 can be approximated using Stirling’s
approximation as27 9  where
ρ represents the normality constant
and ε̅ = 1/Npε is the
mean value of the statistical energy gap. Since the energy gap g is sufficiently large, the summation (7) could be changed to the integral form as27 10  The mean numbers of e–s
in the CB for the prefixed energy ε is represented by Npε (a constant) and g = [Npεε] (the greatest integer
part of Npεε), and eq 10 for the given Npε and the statistical energy gap g could be approximated as Gaussian distribution with μ
= ε̅ and σ2 = ε̅/Npε, and the density function for energy
(ε) would be represented as28,29 11  Model
3: If medium number of e–s are transferred (Npε) to CB,
then e– distribution would neither be determined
by Gaussian method nor by exponential model. In this situation, the
mixture of these two distributions could be considered as an alternative
model. The analytical expression for mixed Gauss–exponential
density function is considered to be a convex combination of Gaussian
and exponential distributions, which is of the form28,29 12   13  where α is the incidence probability.
The threshold energy required for e– transport across
the band gap of the LDH (from VB to CB) at a given temperature T is represented by EC. Hence,
if the supplied energy E > EC, then the e– movement from VB to CB is
possible. Moreover, EC is considered to
be fixed for an LDH or any semiconductor system for all temperatures.
Hence, probability πε(T,εc) of e– transfer from VB to CB at temperature T and energy E, such that E > EC = εc, has been
obtained using Fermi–Dirac statistics using the equation28,29 14  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, EC = εC represents the conduction band energy, and T represents
temperature in Kelvin scale. The approximation for pε, given by Fermi–Dirac statics πε(T, εc) (eq 14), is presented in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Probability of electron
transferred from VB to CB for temperature T and energy E > EC.

The analytical expressions of the models for the statistical
energy
gap based on exponential, Gaussian, and mixed Gauss–exponential
density functions, based on given EC and T, are of the form 15   16   17  The
pattern of energy density is approximated
under different models through the Monte Carlo technique. The Monte
Carlo process provides an empirical summary of the density using the
simulated values, which shares the same distributional properties.
To understand the concept of e– transport across
the semiconductor LDH under different suggested models, it is assumed
that the defects/traps are distributed according to the choice of
the model.12−15,30−32 The pattern
of distribution of the number of traps on different energy and temperature
scales within the LDH are presented herein. Let Nt (=1.0 × 106) denote the number of traps,
assumed to be distributed uniformly in a 100 × 100 × 100
cubic box, with periodic boundary condition being considered; kB (=1.38 × 10–23 J K–1) represents Boltzmann constant; To is the standard temperature (in Kelvin); and EC denotes the conduction band energy of the
LDH. EC defines the minimum amount of
energy required to transfer an electron from VB to CB. To incorporate
the situation considered for model 1, the energy gap has been assumed
to be sufficiently large and therefore the probability of availability
of electron in CB is considered to be very small. This is possible
only if EC is comparatively very low,
and for consideration of this extreme situation, it is assumed that EC = 0 (unknown). On the other hand, to incorporate
a more realistic condition, where EC has
been calculated on the basis of the parameters under the experimental
setup, it is denoted as EC (calculated).
In the present study, the density of the LDH has been approximated32 for both the conditions and the pattern of density
is approximated for conduction band energy (EC) and valence band energy (EV),
which has been calculated using the following equations reported by
Zhang et al.36 18   19  where χ and Eg represent the absolute electronegativity and band gap energy of
the LDH, respectively; PZZP is the pH (7.2) at which Fe/Ti LDH exhibits
zero ζ-potential (S2; Supporting
Information); and pH* is the experimentally observed pH 7.2, in which
the surface of the material remains neutral. The χoxide (eV) value was calculated by using the following set of equations: 20   21  where χ (eV; elements)
is the electronegetivity
of elements in eV scale; EIE and EIE are, respectively, the first ionization energy
and first electron affinity of the elements in eV scale; and χoxide (eV) represents the absolute electronegetivity of the
oxide in eV scale. The approximated formula of the mixed metal oxide
is calculated using SEM/EDX data and is found to be Fe0.67Ti0.33O1.55 (S3;
Supporting Information), and for this mixed oxide, χoxide (eV) is calculated as 5.77 eV (S4; Supporting
Information). In this study, the EC and EV values are calculated by using these equations,
which are used to have the patterns of energy density under different
models through the Monte Carlo technique. The values of EC and EV are calculated to
be −4.45 and −7.10 eV, respectively, for Fe/Ti LDH.32−35

The patterns of trap density for Fe/Ti LDH under the three
different
models have been approximated under two sets of conditions EC = 0 and −4.45 eV, using Monte Carlo
simulations, and are shown in Figures 9–11. It depicts the distributional pattern of the trap densities with
changes in the energy level (in eV) and temperature (in Kelvin) for
both the scenarios under EC = 0 and −4.45
eV, respectively. At EC = 0 (Figure 9A), the distribution
of trap numbers, based on model 1, showed that with increase in temperature
and energy below ∼0.45 eV, the trap numbers show an increasing
pattern, and above that energy, it starts decreasing and is observed
to be stabilized around 4 × 105. Under model 2, for EC = 0, the trap numbers (Figure 9B) show an increasing trend with increase
in temperature and energy. When EC = −4.45
eV (Figure 9C), the
trap number based on model 1 shows a decreasing trend; on the other
hand, Figure 9D, based
on model 2, shows an increasing trend in trap numbers with increase
in temperature and energy.

Figure 9 Trap energies are distributed according to exponential
(A, C) and
Gaussian (B, D) densities for given temperature T and energy E > EC =
0 and EC = −4.45 eV.

Figure 10 Trap energies are distributed according to mixed Gauss–exponential
models for different α = {(A) 0.1, (B) 0.3, (C) 0.5, (D) 0.8}
for given temperature T and energy E > EC = 0 eV.

Figure 11 Trap energies are distributed according to mixed Gauss–exponential
models for different α = {(A) 0.1, (B) 0.3, (C) 0.5, (D) 0.8}
for temperature T and energy E > EC = −4.45 eV.

Figures 10 and 11 depicts the changing pattern in trap
numbers with
changes in temperature and energy in model 3 at EC = 0 and −4.45 eV, respectively, for different
values of incidence probability, say α. Here, as α, temperature,
and energy below ∼0.45 eV increase, the trap numbers show an
increasing trend (Figure 10), and above 0.45 eV energy level, the trap numbers show a
decreasing pattern. In Figure 11, where EC = −4.45
eV, it is observed that with increase in α and temperature,
the trap numbers increase toward lower energy levels.

4 Conclusions
Thus, Fe/Ti LDH exhibited hexagonal morphology
with narrow band
gap within the layered framework. The occurrence of e– transport across the semiconducting LDH has been confirmed using
UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy analysis. Accordingly,
empirical models based on exponential, Gaussian, and the mixed Gauss–exponential
distributions successfully justified the concept of e– transport across the band gap of the LDH nanomaterial. Fermi–Dirac
statistics successfully estimated the probability of transfer of e– from VB to CB at a given temperature and for given
energy. The simulated results based on model 1 reveals that exponential
distribution to be appropriate under the conditions where the energy
gap is sufficiently large and the probability of availability of electron
in CB is very small. Moreover, the present work also reveals the importance
of Gaussian (when the energy gap is sufficiently large and probability
of availability of electron is not close to zero) and mixed Gauss–exponential
models (when the medium number of electrons are transferred to the
CB) for interpretation of the e– transport phenomenon
across the LDHs.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, TiCl4, and urea of analytical
grade are used as precursors for Fe/Ti LDH synthesis, acquired from
Merck Chemicals Co. Decarbonated water has been used during the experimental
processes.

5.2 Fe/Ti LDH Synthesis
Fe/Ti LDH has
been synthesized hydrothermally using Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, TiCl4, and urea. The typical hydrothermal
synthesis involves mixing of 11.169 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 1.1 mL of TiCl4, and 3.0 g of urea
together in 100 mL of decarbonated water at room temperature (303.15
K) with vigorous stirring for 2 h followed by aging in a Teflon-lined
autoclave at 413.15 K for 36 h. The brick-red crystalline product
was extracted with centrifugation, washed three times with water,
and dried at 353.15 K for 6 h.

5.3 Characterizations
Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of Fe/Ti LDH was carried out using a PANalytical X’Pert
PRO diffractometer equipped with monochromatic Cu Kα X-ray radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm) at 25 mA and 35 kV with a scanning rate of
4° min–1 along the 2θ range of 5–80°.

The morphological study and the elemental composition of Fe/Ti
LDH were evaluated with Zeiss Gemini SEM (5 kV)/EDX (15 kV). Gold
coating of the specimen was done at ∼6 nm min–1 (at a pressure of 7 × 10–2 Pa and a current
20 mA) with Quorum (Q 150R ES). Atomic force microscopy (Oxford Instruments;
Cypher Asylum Research, equipped with ARC2 controller) was employed
in noncontact tapping mode using a Si tip of 10 nm radius to obtain
information about the surface topography of Fe/Ti LDH. The Fe/Ti LDH
sample is dispersed in ethanol (EtOH) by ultrasonication for ∼5
min, and the dispersion was spread over a glass slide (10 × 10
mm2) with a micropipette and dried such that the stacked
hexagonal layers, observed in the SEM images, open up to one single
nanolayer or at least two to three-stacked nanolayers. The dispersed
solution was then spread over a square glass slide with a micropipette
and then allowed to dry in air. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectroscopy was conducted with a Shimadzu FT-IR 3000 spectrometer.
The LDH sample was mixed with KBr in weight ratio 1:100 and compressed
to form pellets for analysis. UV–visible diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy of the LDH sample was conducted with a Hitachi U4100
spectrometer, equipped with integrating sphere attachment having BaSO4 background.
