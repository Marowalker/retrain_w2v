Bio-oil production from microalgae
by using hydrothermal liquefaction
(HTL) has been conducted extensively in the last decade. In this work,
we conducted two-stage HTL of a microalga (Fistulifera
solaris, JPCC DA0580) in the presence of 5.0 g/L carbon
solid acid or a 0.02–0.50 M HCl catalyst to increase bio-oil
yield and nitrogen recovery into the aqueous phase (AP). The first
stage (HTL 1), to hydrolyze proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids and
elute nitrogen components into the AP, was conducted at 100–250
°C for 30–120 min. The second stage (HTL 2), to produce
the bio-oil, was conducted at 280–320 °C for 0–30
min. The best conditions to obtain a high bio-oil yield and NH4+ recovery in the AP were 200 °C and 30 min
of residence time for HTL 1 and 320 °C and 0 min residence time
for HTL 2. We found that 0.50 M HCl decreased the bio-oil yield while
greatly increasing NH4+ in the AP and decreasing
the nitrogen content in the bio-oil. This was probably due to the
catalytic effect of HCl promoting hydrolysis of protein and deamination
of amino acids during HTL 1. The fractions of water-soluble products
were greatly increased by performing HTL 2 in neutral conditions while
this maintained low nitrogen content in the bio-oil. From GC–MS
analyses of the bio-oil, it was observed that, by using 0.50 M HCl,
peak intensities of all the GC peaks decreased and MS spectra of amines
decreased. The carbon solid acid had an insignificant influence on
bio-oil and NH4+ yields.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Bio-oil derived from microalgae is an attractive alternative to
fossil fuels since microalgae generally contain a large amount of
lipids, their growth rate is high, and their cultivation does not
compete with food production.1−5 The bio-oil from microalgae is produced via cultivation, harvesting,
dehydration, and extraction processes1 using
solvents, supercritical CO2, or microwaves. In the solvent
extraction method, bio-oil is extracted using nonpolar organic solvents
such as hexane or polar organic solvents such as methanol and chloroform.5−9 It is possible to maximize the extraction of lipids by decomposing
polar lipid complexes with polar organic solvents and solubilizing
intracellular lipids with nonpolar organic solvents.7 However, solvent extraction is usually uneconomic due to
consumption of much energy to dry the microalgae as pretreatment and
the need to separate bio-oil from solvent after extraction. Tsutsumi
et al.10 reported that many environmental
hazards and safety problems remain in bio-oil recovery by solvent
extraction because a large amount of organic solvent is needed.

Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is another method of extracting
bio-oil from biomass. In HTL, microalgae react in subcritical water
at 250–350 °C and 5–20 MPa and are decomposed into
an oil phase, an aqueous phase (AP), gas-phase products, and char.11−13 Because this method does not require an energy-intensive drying
process, energy consumption is considered to be low.14 In addition, the nutrients dissolved in the AP15,16 can be reused in the culturing process.17−20 Moreover, the bio-oil yield is
higher than that by other extraction methods since substances (carbohydrates
and proteins) other than lipids can also be decomposed and converted
to oil components. However, the bio-oil obtained after HTL contains
a large amount of nitrogen compared to that obtained by the solvent
extraction method. This causes oligomerization of the molecules, an
increase in viscosity of the bio-oil, and inhibitory effects in the
purification process.21 It is therefore
necessary to decrease the nitrogen content in the bio-oil by eluting
more NH4+ into the AP after HTL. This also greatly
lowers the cost of nutrients for the culturing process.

Shakya
et al.22,23 measured yields of products (bio-oil,
char, water-soluble products, and gas), total acid number of the products,
pH, density, heating value, ash, moisture, and elemental composition
of bio-oils produced after HTL of different strains of microalgae
at various temperatures in the absence and presence of Na2CO3. They concluded that other than the product yield,
the use of Na2CO3 had no significant effect
on the properties of the bio-oil,22 and
the obtained APs contained a large amount of total organic carbon
(12–43 g/L), chemical oxygen demand (35–160 g/L), total
nitrogen (1–18 g/L), ammonium (0.34–12 g/L), and phosphate
(0.7–12 g/L).23

It has been
reported that the reaction mechanism of HTL of algae
involves four consecutive steps: (1) hydrolytic depolymerization of
the proteins and carbohydrates to form water-soluble monomers such
as peptide fragments, amino acids, and carbohydrate derivatives; (2)
degradation of the monomers by dehydration, deamination, and decarboxylation;
(3) recombination/condensation of reactive fragments between (i) fatty
acids and (ii) the decarboxylation products of amino acids and fragments
of the carbohydrate derivatives and/or fatty acids to form the bio-oil;
and (4) polymerization at a prolonged reaction time to form char.24−28 Chiaberge et al. stated that the most likely origin of fatty acid
amides in hydrothermal bio-oils is the condensation reaction between
fatty acids and the decarboxylation products of amino acids.25 Matayeva et al. recently investigated the reaction
mechanisms of HTL of phenylalanine, leucine, and a mixture of tripalmitine
and phenylalanine and stated that phenylethylamine or isopentylamine,
which is produced by decarboxylation of phenylalanine or leucine,
reacted with other products, forming amides that became nitrogen-containing
components of the bio-oil.28 Nitrogen from
amino acids can be recovered in the AP mainly as NH4+ following the deamination of amino acids.29−34 Based on these reaction mechanisms, it is very important to elute
NH4+ (or NH3) by promoting the deamination
of amino acids and to decrease the amount of nitrogen in bio-oil by
suppressing production of amides and nitrogen-containing heterocyclic
compounds.

A two-stage HTL method has been attracting attention
(Table 1).35−38 In the first stage, the proteins
in the microalgae are hydrolyzed and solubilized into the AP at ≤250
°C. In the second stage, the bio-oil is produced during decomposition
of other components and repolymerization at 250–350 °C.35 Bio-oil with low nitrogen content has been produced
using two-stage HTL.35−37 Costanzo et al.36 successfully
reduced 0–23 wt % of the nitrogen content in bio-oil with two-stage
HTL of UGA Consortium, Nannochloropsis and Spirulina relative to one-stage HTL. Prapaiwatcharapan et
al.37 reported that bio-oil with low nitrogen
content (approximately 2–4 wt%) was produced from Coelastrum sp. Jazrawi et al.35 reported the bio-oil
obtained by direct HTL of Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris) at 300 °C contained
7.5 wt % of nitrogen and the nitrogen content in the bio-oil was decreased
to 3.4% by two-stage HTL. Moreover, Sunphorka et al.38 investigated the nitrogen content in the AP after two-stage
HTL of Coelastrum sp. and reported that two-stage
HTL resulted in higher NH4+ yields than that
of conventional one-stage HTL. Regarding the bio-oil yield, it has
been reported37 that the two-stage HTL
method increased the bio-oil yield compared with one-stage HTL. However,
the bio-oil yield decreased from 25 to 11–20 wt % in the two-stage
HTL reported by Jazrawi et al.,35 and the
nitrogen content in the bio-oil was still high.

On the basis of the results of these
studies, it is believed that
two-stage HTL with acid catalysts prevents the polymerization of bio-oil,
amino acids, and their derivatives during thermal decomposition in
subcritical water, decreases the nitrogen content in the bio-oil,
and promotes elution of water-soluble products such as NH4+ into the AP. The objective of this study was to determine
the optimum conditions for two-stage HTL and the effect of using acid
catalysts on bio-oil quantity and quality and NH4+ recovery from microalgae. It was reported that the addition of acetic
acid significantly increases bio-oil yields and N contents in the
bio-oil in the case of phenylalanine and leucine HTL though formic
acid has an insignificant effect on the bio-oil yields and N contents.28 Thus, in the present study, two-stage HTL was
conducted using carbon solid acid (SA) and inorganic acid (HCl) to
promote protein hydrolysis and deamination of amino acids at low temperature
and bio-oil production.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effects of Reaction Temperature, Residence
Time, and Carbon SA on Bio-Oil and NH4+ Yields
in One-Stage HTL
The one-stage HTL was conducted at various
reaction temperatures (280, 300, and 320 °C) and residence times
(0, 15, and 30 min) in the absence and presence of the carbon SA catalyst
(0, 5.0 g/L). Note the residence time was defined as the time after
the reactor temperature reached the set temperature. Blank experiments
were conducted by using the carbon SA catalyst. Table S1 shows the results. At 320 °C, 17%, 23.93%, and
29.1% SA was lost during HTL for 0, 15, and 30 min, respectively.
No oil-phase formation was observed. These indicate that some of the
SA dissolved into AP or was converted into gas. At 300 and 280 °C,
a much smaller amount of SA was lost. Figure 1a shows the bio-oil yield as a function of
temperature when the residence time was 30 min. Note hereafter that
the error bars show the standard deviations of the results under each
condition and the weight of the dry microalga is of a dry basis. In
the absence of the carbon SA catalyst, the bio-oil yield was 0.0668
± 0.00440 g/g-dry microalgae at 280 °C, and it decreased
when the temperature was increased to 300 and 320 °C. In the
presence of the carbon SA, the bio-oil yield increased as the temperature
increased. The bio-oil yield peaked at 0.0747 ± 0.00473 g/g-dry
microalgae in the presence of the SA at 320 °C. At 300 and 320
°C, the bio-oil yield was increased by the addition of the carbon
SA relative to its absence. This implies that hydrolysates derived
from lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins were polymerized and converted
into bio-oil components. Figure 1b shows the NH4+ yield as a function
of temperature with or without the SA when the residence time was
30 min. The NH4+ yield increased up to 300 °C.
No further increase in the NH4+ yield was observed
at 320 °C. This implies that the proteins were not completely
hydrolyzed and decomposed to NH4+ at 280 °C
in 30 min; thus, it was necessary to increase the reaction temperature
to ≥300 °C to hydrolyze more proteins and increase the
NH4+ yield. No significant effect of carbon
SA was observed on the NH4+ yield. From the
viewpoints of bio-oil and NH4+ yields, the optimum
temperature for the one-stage HTL (corresponding to step HTL 2 in
the two-stage HTL) was 320 °C.

Figure 1 Effects of reaction temperature on bio-oil
and NH4+ yields in the presence/absence of the
carbon solid acid catalyst
in one-stage HTL when the residence time was 30 min: (a) bio-oil yield
and (b) NH4+ yield.

Figure 2a,b shows
the bio-oil and NH4+ yields as a function of
residence time with or without SA when the temperature in one-stage
HTL was 320 °C. It can be seen that the bio-oil yield peaked
at 0.0852 ± 0.00144 g/g-microalgae in the absence of SA at a
0 min residence time and decreased with increased residence time.
When the residence time was 0 or 15 min, the bio-oil yield was decreased
by carbon SA. However, at 30 min, the bio-oil yield was increased
by carbon SA. No clear effect of carbon SA and residence time on the
NH4+ yield was observed. This implies that deamination
of amino acids, which produces NH4+ and organic
acids,29−34 was completed when the reaction temperature reached 320 °C.

Figure 2 Effects
of residence time on bio-oil and NH4+ yields
in the presence/absence of the carbon solid acid catalyst
in one-stage extraction when the reaction temperature was 320 °C:
(a) bio-oil yield and (b) NH4+ yield.

Table 2 shows the
yields of char and AP products (total C, NH4+, and total N) and pH of the AP under the same conditions as in Figures 1 and 2. No significant decrease in pH of the AP was observed by
the addition of the SA. Yields of char and total C decreased as temperature
increased and residence time became longer. In the presence of SA,
the char yield increased and the total C yield decreased. The increase
in char yield by the addition of SA was in the range of 50.9–83.2
mg/g-microalgae (dry basis) under the same reaction temperature and
residence time. As stated in the Experimental Section, 3.0 g of dry microalgae and 5.0 g/L SA were used in 100 cm3 of distilled water. Thus, the increase in the char yield
should be 167 mg/g-microalgae (dry basis) (= 5.0 g-SA/L × 0.100
L/3.0 g-microalgae × 1000). This indicates that some of the SA
was dissolved during HTL. The total N yield did not increase with
increased temperature or residence time. On addition of SA, the total
N yield decreased slightly. Thus, the ratio of NH4+ to total N in the AP was increased by the SA. It was found
that most of the aqueous N was recovered as NH4+ after HTL. Shakya et al.22 conducted
HTL of Nannochloropsis, Pavlova,
and Isochrysis at 250, 300, and 350 °C and reported
that the yield of bio-oils increased and that of the water-soluble
fraction decreased with increasing reaction temperature. This was
due to polymerization of water-soluble components in the AP into bio-oil.
They reported that the char yield decreased from 250 to 300 °C;
however, no significant effect was observed on increasing the temperature
to 350 °C.22 In their following study,23 they conducted HTL of Chlorella, Nannochloropsis, Pavlova, and Scenedesmus at 280 and 320 °C and reported similar
trends for yields of bio-oil, water-soluble fractions, and char with
the reaction temperature. They also reported that, in most of the
algal species, NH4+ yields increased with the
increase of reaction temperature from 280 to 320 °C. A similar
trend for char and total C yields was observed in the present study.

Based
on the above results, to enhance bio-oil and NH4+ yields, the optimum residence time in one-stage extraction
(corresponding to HTL 2 in the two-stage HTL) at 320 °C was determined
to be 0 min.

2.2 Effects of Reaction Temperature,
Residence
Time, and Carbon SA in HTL 1 in Two-Stage HTL
The two-stage
HTL was performed at various temperatures (100, 150, 200, and 250
°C) for 30 min in HTL 1 with and without SA (0, 5.0 g/L). Figure 3a shows the total
bio-oil yield at the end of HTL 2 as a function of temperature in
HTL 1 compared with the results of one-stage HTL. The HTL 2 was conducted
at 320 °C for the residence time of 0 min. In the absence of
SA, the bio-oil yield was slightly increased by the increase of temperature
from 100 to 200 °C. However, at 250 °C, the bio-oil yield
significantly decreased. No significant influence of the presence
of SA on the bio-oil yield was observed at 100 °C. However, above
100 °C, the bio-oil yield was significantly decreased by SA.
The bio-oil yields were 0.0820 ± 0.0012 g/g-dry microalgae and
0.0713 ± 0.008 g/g-dry microalgae in the absence and presence
of SA at 200 °C during HTL 1, respectively. It was observed that
the bio-oil yield was decreased by 7–15 wt % by the addition
of SA. Compared with the results of bio-oil yields in one-stage HTL
(see Figures 1a and 2a), the addition of SA increased the bio-oil yield
only under the conditions of one-stage HTL at 300 and 320 °C
for 30 min of the residence time. In other cases at different reaction
temperatures and shorter residence times in HTL 1, the bio-oil yields
were decreased by the addition of SA. There is a possibility that
some of the bio-oil is absorbed by the remaining SA.

Figure 3 Effects of reaction temperature
on bio-oil and NH4+ yields in the presence/absence
of carbon solid acid catalyst
in two-stage HTL when the residence time in HTL 1 was 30 min and the
residence time of HTL 2 was 0 min: (a) bio-oil yield and (b) NH4+ yield. Note: (−) indicates one-stage HTL
2 without HTL 1 (residence time was 0 min, cf. Figure 2).

Figure 3b shows
the NH4+ yield as a function of temperature
with or without the SA. As the temperature in HTL 1 rose, the NH4+ yield in the AP after HTL 1 greatly increased.
This implies that hydrolysis of proteins and deamination of amino
acids were promoted by increasing the temperature in HTL 1, eluting
NH4+ into the AP. In the following HTL 2, further
NH4+ was eluted into the AP at each temperature.
The total NH4+ yield peaked at 29.7 ± 0.1
and 27.3 ± 1.6 mg/g-dry microalgae when HTL 1 was conducted at
200 °C and HTL 2 was then conducted as 320 °C in the absence
and presence of SA, respectively. These values were higher than those
when one-stage HTL 2 was conducted at 320 °C, indicating that
the two-stage HTL is effective for recovery of NH4+. To maximize bio-oil and NH4+ yields,
the optimum temperature in HTL 1 was found to be 200 °C. The
optimum temperatures of HTL 1 and HTL 2 obtained in this study were
similar to those of the two-stage HTL for Coelastrum sp. (i.e., 200 and 320 °C, respectively) reported
by Prapaiwatcharapan et al.37

The
two-stage HTL was carried out changing the residence time in
HTL 1. Figure 4a shows
the total bio-oil yield after HTL 1 for 30, 60, and 120 min when the
temperature was 200 °C followed by HTL 2 at 320 °C with
0 min residence time. Note that the SA catalyst was not used in this
experiment. As the residence time increased, the total bio-oil yield
decreased. The amount of carbon components in the AP increased in
HTL 1 (Table 2). These
results were similar to those of the report of Jazrawi et al.35 After HTL 2, as the residence time used during
HTL 1 increased, an insignificant increase of the total C yield was
observed, indicating that most of water-soluble carbon components
were eluted into the AP. Figure 4b shows the NH4+ yield after
HTL 1 and after HTL 2 as a function of residence time during HTL 1.
When the residence time in HTL 1 was prolonged, the NH4+ yield increased slightly after HTL 1, implying slight
promotion of the hydrolysis of protein and deamination of amino acids.
However, changing the residence time had no significant effect on
the total NH4+ yield. The total N yield in the
AP slightly increased with the increase in residence time in HTL 1,
implying promotion of hydrolysis of protein.

Figure 4 Effects of residence
time of HTL 1 on bio-oil and NH4+ yields in
two-stage HTL in the absence of the carbon
solid acid when the reaction temperature of HTL 1 was 200 °C:
(a) bio-oil yield and (b) NH4+ yield. Note:
subsequent HTL 2 was conducted at 320 °C for 0 min.

Table 3a shows
the
yields of NH4+, total C, and total N in the
AP and char after HTL 1 and after HTL 1 and HTL 2. The pH of the AP
after HTL is also shown. In most of the experiments, the pH of the
AP was slightly larger than 7. No significant influence of the SA
on pH was observed. In the case of SA, the char yield increased due
to the remaining SA. Total C and N yields were greatly increased with
increasing temperature in HTL 1. The total C yield did not significantly
increase in HTL 2 at 320 °C after HTL 1 at 200 and 250 °C
for 30 min. This indicates that 200 °C and 30 min is sufficient
to elute water-soluble carbon components in HTL 1. The total C yield
in the AP was slightly decreased by the carbon SA. The total N yield
greatly increased in HTL 2 compared with the results in HTL 1 at each
temperature, indicating hydrolysis and decomposition of protein and
amino acids. However, the total NH4+ and total
N yields were almost constant after HTL 1 and HTL 2 were conducted.
No significant influence of temperature on the char yield was observed. Table 3b shows elemental
analyses of bio-oil and char. No significant influence of the SA addition
on bio-oil composition was observed. On the basis of the above results,
the optimum conditions for HTL 1 and HTL 2 were found to be HTL 1:
200 °C, 30 min residence time and HTL 2: 320 °C, 0 min residence
time.

2.3 Effect of HCl on the Bio-Oil Yield and Nitrogen
Components in the Two-Stage HTL
In this study, no clear effect
of SA was observed on bio-oil production and NH4+ recovery in the two-stage HTL. This may be because (i) there was
insufficient contact between the microalga/its derivatives and catalyst
particles and/or (ii) the acidity was insufficient. Thus, we tried
using inorganic acid (HCl) in the two-stage HTL to promote hydrolysis
of protein and deamination of amino acids by increasing the contact
and acidity of the catalyst.39 Note: we
did not use carboxylic acid to avoid formation of amides. Because
the concentration of acidic organic functional groups on the surface
of the SA was 0.018 M as calculated from eq 1. 1  The concentration of HCl solution
was set to 0.02, 0.10, and 0.50 M in the following experiments. The
diatom sample was mixed with the HCl solutions instead of distilled
water, and then the HTL experiments were conducted with the same procedures.

Table 4 shows yields
and elemental analysis of bio-oil and char after two-stage HTL (200
°C, 30 min and 320 °C, 0 min) at various HCl concentrations.
An insignificant change in the bio-oil yield was observed when using
0.02 M HCl relative to the absence of HCl. However, a further increase
in the HCl concentration led to a significant decrease in the bio-oil
yield. In particular, 0.50 M HCl caused 42.8 wt % reduction of the
bio-oil yield relative to the case without HCl. The same trend can
be seen in the char yield. The nitrogen content of bio-oil without
the HCl catalyst was 2.17 wt %. However, the nitrogen content with
0.50 M HCl was greatly decreased to 0.41 wt %. Thus, using 0.50 M
HCl in the two-stage HTL successfully decreased the nitrogen content
in the bio-oil by approximately 80 wt %. In one-stage HTL, it has
not been confirmed that acid catalysts significantly decrease the
nitrogen content in the bio-oil.16,40,41 Also, decreased nitrogen content in char was observed
with 0.50 M HCl. The nitrogen contents of the char and carbon contents
of bio-oil and char greatly decreased by using 0.5 M HCl.

Table 5 shows the
NH4+ yield, total C, total N, and pH in the
AP as a function of the concentration of HCl. Higher HCl concentrations
(0.50 M) greatly increased the NH4+, total C,
and total N yields after HTL 1 and decreased the nitrogen content
of the bio-oil and char. This obviously indicates that 0.50 M HCl
as the acid catalyst promotes protein hydrolysis in HTL 1 and elution
of water-soluble hydrolysates including NH4+ into the AP before the hydrolysates polymerize with the lipid component
and enter the bio-oil in HTL 2. Approximately 77 to 82 wt % the nitrogen
components in the AP were present as NH4+ after
HTL 2. These results are indirectly in accordance with the results
of Torri et al. in that protein degradation drastically increased
bio-oil yields and the hydrophobic portion of protein or carbohydrate
derived materials increased the nitrogen content of the bio-oil.26 Matayeva et al.28 recently conducted HTL of model amino acids (phenylalanine and leucine),
glucose, and lipids (tripalmitin) in the presence of homogeneous catalysts
(0.02 M CH3COOH, HCOOH, and Na2CO3) and reported that the yields of bio-oil and nitrogen components
in the bio-oil increased and nitrogen in the AP was decreased by CH3COOH. However, HCOOH and Na2CO3 did
not significantly affect the bio-oil yield and elemental composition.28 Our results show that pH should be lower than
5 to decrease the nitrogen content in bio-oil.

From
the results in Tables 4 and 5, a decrease of the bio-oil yield
caused by the presence of HCl is considered to occur in HTL 2. Therefore,
HTL 2 was performed with distilled water (i.e., HCl
= 0 M) after 0.50 M HCl was added as a catalyst in HTL 1, and the
acidic solution was then removed by solid–liquid separation. Figure 5 shows the carbon
and nitrogen balances of char, bio-oil, the AP, and gas in one-stage
HTL and two-stage HTL with HCl as a catalyst in HTL 1 and HTL 2. The
total carbon components in the AP significantly changed from 31.9%
in the fifth set of conditions we tested (i.e., condition
5: HTL 1: 0.50 HCl M + HTL 2: 0.50 M HCl) to 58.9% in the sixth set
(i.e., condition 6: HTL 1: 0.50 HCl M + HTL 2: distilled
water). The carbon and nitrogen components of char and bio-oil were
greatly decreased by increasing the HCl concentration in HTL 1. It
is likely that the bio-oil and char were decomposed into gases. Biller
et al.40 reported that increasing acidity
decreased the bio-oil yield and increased gas production. Our data
also show that increasing the acidity was disadvantageous in terms
of the bio-oil yield. The carbon component of the bio-oil was 10.34%
and 5.24% under conditions 5 and 6, respectively. It can be seen that
the nitrogen contents in the AP were increased from 76.9% under condition
5 to 80.7% under condition 6 by performing HTL 2 in neutral conditions.
The carbon balance in char was 14.36% and 5.50%, and the nitrogen
balance in char was 2.04% and 1.08% in conditions 5 and 6, respectively.
It can be concluded that the nitrogen content in the bio-oil is decreased
by the addition of HCl in HTL 1, which promotes the hydrolysis of
proteins and deamination of amino acids while suppressing the formation
of amines and amides, and it is better to carry out neutral conditions
by using distilled water in HTL 2 to recover a larger amount of nutrients
in the AP.

Figure 5 (a) Carbon and (b) nitrogen balances of the products after one-stage
HTL and two-stage HTL in the presence of HCl. Conditions: HTL 1: 200
°C and 30 min; HTL 2: 320 °C and 0 min. Note: (−)
indicates one-stage HTL 2 without HTL 1; 0 M indicates pure water

Figure 6 shows the
results of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
analysis of bio-oil obtained after one-stage and two-stage HTL in
the absence/presence of HCl under the same experimental conditions
as those in Figure 5. The mass spectra of each GC peak at each retention time and possible
chemical composition of each molecular weight (MW) are shown in Figure S1 and Table S2, respectively.

Figure 6 Gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis
of bio-oil obtained after one-stage and two-stage HTL in the presence
of HCl. Conditions are same as those in Figure 5.

In Figure 6, it
is observed that GC peaks at the retention time (RT) around 9.2, 9.5,
9.9, 14.9, 17.5–17.8, 18.1–18.5, and 18.8 min increased
until the HCl concentration increased up to 0.10 M (condition 4) and
decreased in the case of 0.50 M HCl was used (conditions 5 and 6).
In particular, the GC peaks around 14.9 and 17.5–17.8 min greatly
decreased under conditions 5 and 6. When the HCl concentrations were
0.10 and 0.50 M (conditions 4, 5, and 6), a small GC peak was observed
around 17.2 min.

From MS spectra, when the RT was 9.2 min (Figure S1a), the MS spectra of amines (MW = 55, 57, 97, 111, 140),
oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (MW = 70, 126, 140, 196), hydrocarbons
(MW = 196), and linoleic acid (C18:2, MW = 280) were observed. Similar
MS spectra were observed at different HCl concentrations up to 0.10
M (conditions 1–4). Under conditions 5 and 6, the intensities
of the MS spectra were under the detection limit.

When the RT
was 9.5 min (Figure S1b),
amines (MW = 57, 109, 123, 137), nitrile (MW = 82, 95, 123, 137),
and linolenic acid (C18:3, MW = 278) were observed. The intensities
of the spectra were similar under conditions 1–5. However,
under condition 6, peaks of MW = 57, 109, and 137 greatly decreased.
When the RT was 9.9 min (Figure S1c), very
similar trends of the MS peaks compared with Figure S1b were observed except for the great increase of MW = 109
under condition 5. When the RT was 14.9 min (Figure S1d), the MS spectra of amines (MW = 60, 73, 85, 115, 129,
143, 157, 171, 185) and myristic acid (C14:0, MW = 228) were observed.
The intensities of the spectra were similar under all conditions.
Under conditions 4, the MS spectra of many peaks (RT = 17.2 min) were
observed (see Figure S1e). With 0.50 M
HCl, the MS spectra of long-chain amines (MW = 255, 283, 381), long-chain
hydrocarbons (MW = 234, 236), and long-chain oxygen-containing hydrocarbons
(MW = 396) were greatly reduced. When the RT was 17.5–17.8
min (Figure S1f), the characteristic MS
spectra of long-chain oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (MW = 396, 404),
amines (MW = 55, 83, 97, 111, 125, 137, 140), nitriles (MS = 83, 137),
oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (MW = 180), and hydrocarbons (MW =
166, 180, 222, 236) were observed. The intensities of the spectra
were similar under all conditions except an appreciable increase in
the spectra of long-chain amines (MW = 255, 283, 381, 396) under condition
5. The peak intensities of these spectra greatly decreased under condition
6. When the RT was 18.1–18.5 min (Figure S1g), the MS spectra of amines (MW = 60, 73, 85, 115, 129,
143, 157, 171, 185, 213, 227) and linoleic acid (C18:2, MW = 256)
were observed. The intensities of the spectra were similar under all
conditions. In summary, when 0.50 M HCl was used, the peaks of amines
and long-chain amines in the bio-oil were decreased.

When the
RT was 9.5 min (Figure S1b),
amines (MW = 57, 109, 123, 137), nitrile (MW = 82, 95, 123, 137),
and linolenic acid (C18:3, MW = 278) were observed. The intensities
of the spectra were similar under conditions 1–5. However,
under condition 6, peaks of MW = 57, 109, and 137 greatly decreased.
When the RT was 9.9 min (Figure S1c), very
similar trends of the MS peaks compared with Figure S1b were observed except for the great increase of MW = 109
under condition 5. When the RT was 14.9 min (Figure S1d), the MS spectra of amines (MW = 60, 73, 85, 115, 129,
143, 157, 171, 185) and myristic acid (C14:0, MW = 228) were observed.
The intensities of the spectra were similar under all conditions.
Under conditions 4, the MS spectra of many peaks (RT = 17.2 min) were
observed (see Figure S1e). With 0.50 M
HCl, the MS spectra of long-chain amines (MW = 255, 283, 381), long-chain
hydrocarbons (MW = 234, 236), and long-chain oxygen-containing hydrocarbons
(MW = 396) were greatly reduced. When the RT was 17.5–17.8
min (Figure S1f), the characteristic MS
spectra of long-chain oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (MW = 396, 404),
amines (MW = 55, 83, 97, 111, 125, 137, 140), nitriles (MS = 83, 137),
oxygen-containing hydrocarbons (MW = 180), and hydrocarbons (MW =
166, 180, 222, 236) were observed. The intensities of the spectra
were similar under all conditions except an appreciable increase in
the spectra of long-chain amines (MW = 255, 283, 381, 396) under condition
5. The peak intensities of these spectra greatly decreased under condition
6. When the RT was 18.1–18.5 min (Figure S1g), the MS spectra of amines (MW = 60, 73, 85, 115, 129,
143, 157, 171, 185, 213, 227) and linoleic acid (C18:2, MW = 256)
were observed. The intensities of the spectra were similar under all
conditions. In summary, when 0.50 M HCl was used, the peaks of amines
and long-chain amines in the bio-oil were decreased.

3 Conclusions
Two-stage HTL of the microalga Fistulifera sp.
JPCC DA0580 was conducted in subcritical water in a batch reactor
to increase both bio-oil and NH4+ yields. We
investigated the optimum experimental conditions (reaction temperature
and residence time) of two-stage HTL and the effects of acid catalysts
(carbon SA and HCl) on the bio-oil and char yields, components, and
AP content. The best conditions were HTL 1: 200 °C, 30 min of
residence time and HTL 2: 320 °C, 0 min of residence time. No
significant effect of the carbon SA catalyst was observed when its
concentration was 5.0 g/L. By introducing 0.50 M HCl in the two-stage
HTL, we greatly decreased the nitrogen content of the bio-oil and
char and increased NH4+ in the AP. This is probably
due to a catalytic effect of HCl, promoting hydrolysis of protein
and deamination of amino acids during HTL 1. From the results of GC–MS
analyses of the produced bio-oil, it was observed that 0.50 M HCl
suppresses the formation of amines. It is also likely that the recombination/polymerization
of amines with other water-soluble fractions forms the bio-oil and
char. It was found that there is a trade-off between the bio-oil yield
and nitrogen content in the bio-oil.

4.2 Bio-Oil Extraction by HTL
4.2.1 One-Stage HTL
A schematic view
of the experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 7. An autoclave reactor (TPR-1, 300 mL, Taiatsu
Techno. Corporation, Osaka, Japan) was charged with 3.0 g of the microalga
and 100 cm3 of distilled water. After the reactor was purged
with Ar gas (ca. 2.5 MPa), the microalgal slurry was heated to 280–320
°C while stirring with an impeller at 300 rpm. The time required
to heat the reactor to 150, 200, 260, and 300 °C was 11.5, 14.5,
22.0, and 31.0 min, respectively (data not shown). The reaction temperature
was then maintained for 0–60 min. Note: in the case that the
residence time was 0 min, the reactor was cooled soon after the temperature
reached the reaction temperature.

liquefaction (HTL).

4.2.2 Two-Stage
HTL
Stage 1 (HTL 1):
The procedures to charge the sample and purge the reactor were the
same as explained in Section 2.2.1. The reaction temperature was set to 100–250
°C, and the residence time was set to 30–120 min. After
the reactor was cooled to room temperature, the solution in the reactor
(ca. 1 cm3) was collected with a vial syringe. Stage 2
(HTL 2): After the reactor was purged with Ar gas (ca. 2.5 MPa), the
remaining 99 cm3 of microalgal slurry was heated to 320
°C while stirring with the impeller at 300 rpm. The reactor was
cooled soon after the temperature reached 320 °C (i.e., the residence time was 0 min in HTL 2). Each experiment was conducted
two or three times under the same conditions to confirm reproducibility.

The procedure
for product separation in this study is shown in Figure 8. After the reactor was cooled
to room temperature, the products were separated into bio-oil/char
and aqueous solution (i.e., AP product) by filtration.
The bio-oil and solids, which were strongly attached, were collected
from the filter paper and the reactor by using acetone (ca. 100 cm3). The bio-oil was extracted from the solids in acetone for
45 min and then separated with a nylon mesh. Acetone was evaporated
in nitrogen at 80 °C, and then the residue was mixed with 9 cm3 of hexane to dissolve the remaining bio-oil. The bio-oil
was obtained after complete evaporation of the hexane at 80 °C.
Note that the amount of bio-oil was decreased after the extraction
with hexane. Details of the bio-oil recovery procedure were described
elsewhere.47,48

of liquefaction products.

4.4 Analysis of Products
4.4.1 Bio-Oil
and Char
After gravimetry,
drying was carried out using a vacuum dryer (SVD30P, Sansyo, Tokyo,
Japan). Next, elemental analysis was performed on the oil and char
with a CHN analyzer (Micro Coder IM10, J-Science, Kyoto, Japan).

4.4.2 Water-Soluble Fraction
The amount
of NH4+ in the AP was determined with a flow
injection analyzer (PD202, J-Science). The total amount of nitrogen
and carbon in the AP was determined with a TOC analyzer (TOC-VCSH,
Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
