==== Body
In determining the glass transition
temperature (Tg) for our functionalized
polydicyclopentadiene material, we were unfortunately misled by a
calibration artifact associated with our DSC instrument, which caused
us to report the incorrect value. We regret this error and would like
to provide the correct DSC data and Tg here.

As shown in Figure 1, the true Tg value for
our methyl ester-functionalized
polydicyclopentadiene (polymer 6 in our original paper1) is 172 ± 3 °C (average data from 4
runs, acquired on two separate instruments). Although this is considerably
lower than our earlier reported value, it remains the highest reported Tg for an unaged2−4 polydicyclopentadiene
material. As such, our conclusions in the published paper remain valid.

Figure 1 Corrected
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data for crosslinked,
methyl ester-functionalized polydicyclopentadiene. Data were collected
using a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

Acknowledgments
We thank Prof. Paul Ragogna and Tristan
D. Harrison at Western
University for conducting independent DSC measurements to confirm
our corrected Tg results.

Extensive aging of unmodified polydicyclopentadiene
at high temperature is well-known to increase the Tg from a starting value of ∼ 155–165 °C
up to > 200 °C. For further information, see references (3) and (4).
