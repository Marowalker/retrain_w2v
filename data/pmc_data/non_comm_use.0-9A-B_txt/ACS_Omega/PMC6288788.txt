HIV-1 protease plays
an important role in the processing of virus
infection. Protease is an effective therapeutic target for the treatment
of HIV-1. Our data set is based on a selection of 4855 HIV-1 protease
inhibitors (PIs) from ChEMBL. A series of 15 classification models
for predicting the active inhibitors were built by machine learning
methods, including k-nearest neighors (K-NN), decision
tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and deep
neural network (DNN). The molecular structures were characterized
by (1) fingerprint descriptors including MACCS fingerprints and PubChem
fingerprints and (2) physicochemical descriptors calculated by CORINA
Symphony. The prediction accuracies of all of the models are more
than 70% on the test set; the best accuracy of 83.07% was obtained
by model 4A, which was built by the SVM method based on MACCS fingerprint
descriptors. Nine consensus models were built with three kinds of
different descriptors, which combined all of the machine learning
methods using the “consensus prediction”. Model C3a developed with MACCS fingerprint descriptors showed the highest
accuracy on both training set (91.96%) and test set (83.15%). An external
validation set including 35 989 compounds from DUD database and 239
active inhibitors from the recent literature was used to verify the
performance of our model. The best prediction accuracy of 98.37% was
obtained by model 3C, which was built by RF based on CORINA Symphony
descriptors. In addition, from the analysis of molecular descriptors,
it shows that the aromatic system and atoms related to hydrogen bonding
provide important contributions to the bioactivity of PIs.

==== Body
Introduction
AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome) has been a serious threat
to human health since it was first reported in 1981. HIV (human immunodeficiency
virus) is a pathogenic retrovirus which is divided into HIV-1 and
HIV-2. HIV-1 which widely spreads in the world is the main infectious
agent.1 HIV-1 protease plays an important
role in catalyzing the transformation from an immature noninfectious
virus to a mature infectious virus.2 For
the cure of HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 protease is an effective therapeutic
target.3 HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs)
are used as drugs against AIDS in the past years.4 PIs are also members of highly active antiretroviral therapy.5 The PI drugs that have been approved by FDA during
1995–1999 were saquinavir (1995), ritonavir (1996), indinavir
(1996), nelfinavir (1997), and amprenavir (1999).6 However, some limitations affect these drugs, such as low
bioavailability and short half-life. Moreover, extensive toxicity,
gastrointestinal symptoms, and drug resistance have also been reported.6,7 Several PI drugs such as lopinavir (2002), atazanavir (2003), tipranavir,
and darunavir (2005) have also been approved by FDA in recent years,
but the emergence of drug-resistant and cross-resistant HIV-1 variants
still appeared.6 Thus, developing new PIs
for the treatment of HIV-1 is still an ongoing need.

Structure–activity
relationship (SAR) and quantitative structure
activity relationship (QSAR) models are useful methods for studying
the bioactivity of PIs. A mathematical model is used for expressing
the relationship of the molecular structural features and their biological
activities.8 In the work of Deeb and Goodarzi,
partial least square and support vector machine (SVM) methods were
used to develop QSAR models to predict the inhibitory activity. The
data set included 46 nonpeptide HIV-1 PIs. It was divided into a training
set which included 39 (85%) inhibitors and a test set which included
7 (15%) inhibitors. The coefficients of determination (R2) for the training set and the test set were 0.9800 and
0.9355, respectively.9 Using the SAR models,
Ali and colleagues evaluated a set of HIV-1 PIs containing phenyloxazolidinone
to enhance the antiviral potency of the compounds and obtained several
new nM potent inhibitors with a hydroxyethylamine core.10

In this work, we collected 4855 HIV-1
PIs from the ChEMBL database11 as our data
set. Then, computational models
were built to classify the protease active inhibitors on the basis
of their bioactivity. The models were computed by machine learning
methods of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), SVM, and deep neural
network (DNN). Using the models built in this work, a molecule can
efficiently be predicted whether it is an active inhibitor for HIV-1
protease efficiently. The computational models can be used for virtual
screening and give helpful information for drug design and the synthesis
of HIV-1 PIs.

Materials and Methods
Data Set
We collected
4855 molecules and their bioactivity
(IC50/Ki) values of HIV-1 PIs
from ChEMBL.11 The compounds have been
checked according to the literature as shown in the Supporting Information. Taking 10 nM as the threshold, the
compounds were classified as active inhibitors when they were PI-positive
and weakly active or inactive inhibitors when they were PI-negative.
According to this rule, the data set contained 2004 PI-positive and
2851 PIs-negative compounds. In this work, the data set was separated
into a training set and a test set by randomly splitting it in a 2:1
ratio. The training set which contained 3236 compounds was used to
establish a model, and the test set which involved 1619 compounds
was used to validate a model (as shown in Table 1).

Molecular Descriptors
We calculated two types of molecular
descriptors: two different kinds of fingerprints and CORINA Symphony12 descriptors. MACCS fingerprints included 166
patterns and PubChem fingerprints included 881 patterns, which were
calculated by the PaDEL Descriptor software.13

CORINA Symphony was used to calculate chemical and physicochemical
properties of a compound. Two hundred and fourteen CORINA Symphony
descriptors, which include 22 global, 8 size and shape, 88 two-dimensional
(2D) property-weighted autocorrelation, and 96 three-dimensional (3D)
property-weighted autocorrelation descriptors, were calculated.

Global molecular descriptors express a chemical structure by a
chemical, structural, or physicochemical feature or a property of
the molecule represented by a numerical value. For example, HAccN
means the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor atoms derived from the
sum of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. Size and shape descriptors
characterize the size and the 3D shape of a molecule by a numerical
value, such as aspheric which means molecular asphericity.12

2D property-weighted autocorrelation descriptors
use the 2D structure
of a molecule and atom pair properties as a basis to obtain vectorial
molecular descriptors, which characterize the substructure features
of a molecule.12 The atom pair properties
are added up for a certain topological distance which is the number
of bonds on the shortest path between two atoms. The calculated equation
for 2D property-weighted autocorrelation descriptors is shown as eq 1 1  A(d) is
the topological autocorrelation coefficient referring to atom pairs i, j, which are separated by d bonds. pi, pj is an atomic property such
as partial atomic charge on atom i or j, respectively. A single value is obtained as one coefficient of
the 2D autocorrelation vector by summation over all values of a certain
topological distance.

The 3D property-weighted autocorrelation
descriptors use the 3D
structure of a molecule and atom pair properties as a basis for deriving
vectorial molecular descriptors.12 The
atom pair properties are added up for certain 3D distance intervals.
The calculated equation for 3D property-weighted autocorrelation descriptors
is shown as eq 2 2  Ln is the number of distances occurring in a certain distance
interval. pi and pj are the atom properties of
the atoms i and j, respectively.
A single value of
a coefficient results for the 3D autocorrelation vector for each 3D
distance interval.

The Pearson correlation coefficient (CC)
and stepwise linear regression
were used for filtering the CORINA Symphony descriptors in this work.
First, we calculated the Pearson CCs (r) of all pairs
of descriptors and their correlation with bioactivity. The molecular
descriptors which were not obviously correlated with activity (r < 0.1) were removed. If two descriptors are highly
relevant with a CC (r > 0.9), the descriptor which
had the lower CC with the activity would be deleted. Next, the remaining
descriptors were selected again by stepwise linear regression analysis.

We obtained 51 CORINA Symphony descriptors with this approach.
The 51 selected descriptors and the explanations are shown in Table S1. The selected descriptors were normalized
to [0.1, 0.9] via eq 3 before they were used as input for models. 3  where xi is the original value, xi* is the normalized
value, xmin is the minimum value, and xmax is the maximum value of the descriptor variables.

Machine Learning Methods
Machine learning methods have
been widely applied to solve complex classification and prediction
problems of compound activity in drug discovery. In this work, k-NN,14 DT,15 RF,16 SVM,17 and DNN18 were utilized to classify
the HIV-1 PIs.

k-NN is a widely used classification
method. The main idea for this method is that if a sample is in the
most contiguous sample in the feature space, most of them belong to
a certain category and also this sample belongs to this category.
The algorithm averages the response value over the closest neighbors
to estimate the response value.14 The parameters
were selected by a cross-validation method. The number of the closest
neighbors ranged from 3 to 10.

DT learning is a method for approximating
a target function that
will produce discrete values using inductive inference.19 For a DT, each nonleaf node contributes to a
test to be conducted on a single attribute value, each branch represents
the attribute in a certain range of output, and each leaf node stores
a category. Using a DT for making a decision is the process of starting
from the root node, then test for the classification of the corresponding
feature attribute, and its value in accordance with the choice of
the output branch, until one reaches a leaf node. The category of
each leaf node is stored as a decision result. The Classification
and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was adopted to implement this
operation.15 CART provides binary trees
that output the largest information gain at each node. The parameters
were optimized by cross-validation. The range of the minimum number
of samples was from 1 to 5, and the range of the maximum depth was
from 0 to 12.

A RF consists of DTs which have no relationship
with each other.
A RF is an ensemble of unpruned classification trees created by using
bootstrap samples of the training data and random feature selection
in the tree induction.16 The essence of
a RF combines multiple DTs depending on an independent drawing of
samples to improve the result of the DT. The parameters were obtained
by cross-validation. The range of the number of trees was from 10
to 150, and the range of the maximum depth was from 0 to 20.

A SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm for binary class
label prediction.17 The main idea originated
from the Vapnik Chervonenkis dimension and the Vapnik’s structural
risk minimization principle. A SVM builds a hyperplane that can divide
the data in a high-dimensional space. The radial basis function was
used as the kernel function to calculate the scalar product between
two data points in a higher dimensional space. The kernel function
parameters γ (eq 4) and the optimum loss parameter C (eq 5) were chosen through the cross-validation
method. The range for log 2γ and log 2c was
−10 to 10. 4   5   6  

A DNN is
a new field in the study of machine learning. It aims
to establish and simulate the human brain to analyze and learn the
data. DNN is an artificial neural network with more than one intermediate
layer and more neurons in each layer.18−20 The DNN contains an
input layer, an output layer, and several hidden layers. A neuron
is a computing and storage unit in layers. The output of a neuron
is calculated by eq 7 7  O represents
the output. f(x) is the activation
function for a layer. xi is the input value or the
output value of a hidden layer, and wi is the weight of each input or connection between
neurons. b is a default bias term. The parameters
were chosen by cross-validation. We set the number of hidden layers
as 1, 2, and 3. The number of neurons in each hidden layer varied
from 2 to 210.

We chose the sigmoid function as the
activation function for DNN.
The function is shown in eq 8 8  

In the process of training, the loss function
was minimized by
optimizing the weights and bias of neurons using the backward propagation
algorithm. In addition, in this process, the training set was divided
into several batches to optimize the weights and bias randomly. If
all batches were used, the training process completed one epoch. The
number of batches and epochs are related to the convergence and stability
of the model. The number of epoch should be set as large as possible.
The network was trained for 2000 epochs with a batch of 100. The optimizer
function uses the gradient decent rule for the training process. The
optimizer “Adadelta”21 was
used for the models. The learning rate was set as 1.0. The learning
rate decay over each update was set as 0.

Consensus Model
Consensus scoring or data fusion can
enhance the performance of a single classification model by improving
prediction reliability.22 We created several
new consensus models that combine the k-NN, DT, RF,
SVM, and DNN models using the “consensus prediction”.
For each kind of input descriptors, five individual models were obtained
by using the k-NN, DT, RF, SVM, and DNN models. On
the basis of the results of five models, three consensus models (C3,
C4, and C5) were computed for the training and test set. If more than
three of the five single classification model predictions are correct,
the consensus model result is “TRUE”, otherwise it is
“FALSE”. We named this consensus model as C3. Similarly,
we performed consensus model C4 (more than four of the five single
classification model predictions are correct) and C5 (all five single
classification model predictions are correct).” In this way,
nine consensus models were built with three kinds of different descriptors
(CORINA Symphony descriptors, MACCS fingerprints descriptors, and
PubChem fingerprints descriptors).

Evaluation of Model Performance
The models can be evaluated
by the statistical parameters sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP),
and Matthews CC (MCC) as shown in eqs 9–12. 9   10   11   12  

True positive
(TP) represents the number
of PI-positive which were calculated correctly. True negative (TN)
represents the number of PI-negative which were calculated correctly.
False positive (FP) means the number of PI-positive which were computed
incorrectly. False negative (FN) means the number of PI-negative which
were computed incorrectly. SE and SP evaluate the prediction accuracies
for PI-positive and PI-negative, respectively. The range of MCC is
from −1 to 1. The higher the MCC is, the better classification
is provided by the model. To evaluate the predictive ability of the
models, the external validation set was also predicted by the models.
The external validation set included 35 750 decoys derived from the
DUD database23 and 239 active inhibitors
from the recent literature.24−29

The F-score is used to compute the importance
of individual descriptors in this work. This index measures the discrimination
of two sets of real numbers as shown in eq 13. 13  

, , and  represent the average
of the ith descriptor of the whole, PI-positive,
and PI-negative data sets,
respectively. xk,i(+) is the ith descriptor of the kth PI-positive,
and xk,i(−) is the ith descriptor of the kth PI-negative. n+ and n– are
the number of PI-positive and PI-negative, respectively.

Results
and Discussion
Analysis of the Chemical Space and Applicability
Domain
We collected 4855 HIV-1 PIs in the data set, which
contained different
types of compounds, such as the compounds containing a benzothiophene
ring,30 the isosorbide-derived P2 ligands,31 sulfoximine,32 and
so forth.” The data set was separated into a training set and
a test set randomly. The training set contained 1914 PI-negative and
1322 PI-positive structures. The test set contained 936 PI-negative
and 683 PI-positive molecules.

The molecular weight (MW) and
aqueous solubility (log S) are the global molecular
descriptors in the 51 selected CORINA Symphony descriptors. The scattered
distributions of MW and aqueous solubility can characterize the chemical
space for the training set and the test set. Principal component analysis
(PCA) was performed to identify the chemical space of the training
set and the test set. The first two principal components obtained
by PCA of the 51 selected descriptors were used to describe the molecules.
For the PCA analysis, the cumulative contributions of two resulting
principal eigenvectors (PC1 and PC2) reached 39.95 and 14.09%, respectively.
The content in the first two principal components reached 54.04%,
which suggests that PC1 and PC2 can be used to represent the higher
dimensional data set. The chemical spaces for the training set and
the test set nearly completely covered each other as shown in Figure 1. On the basis of
the analysis, the prediction result of the test set is reliable and
dependable.

Figure 1 Scattered distribution for the training set and test set. (a) Chemical
space represented by MW and aqueous solubility (log S). (b) Chemical space characterized by the first two principal components
obtained by PCA.

The chemical space for
predictions by a model is given by the training
set. The compounds in test set must be similar to those in the training
set in some of their properties.33 The
applicability domain is defined as the range of the values of the
selected global descriptor MW and aqueous solubility (log S), which represent the chemical space of the training set
in a simply manner. If a molecule is out of the chemical space, the
prediction can be unreliable.

The molecules
were characterized by MACCS fingerprints, PubChem fingerprints, and
CORINA Symphony descriptors. The models for the classification of
the molecules based on their bioactivity were built by machine learning
methods including k-NN, DT, RF, SVM, and DNN. In
addition, we created new consensus models that combine all of the
machine learning methods using the “consensus prediction”.
The important parameters used to build the models are listed in Table 2. The results of the

Classification
Models Built Using k-NN
Three classification
models were built using k-NN,
model 1A by MACCS fingerprints, model 1B by PubChem fingerprints,
and model 1C using CORINA Symphony descriptors. Model 1B which was
computed using PubChem fingerprint descriptors performed best with
an accuracy of 80.91% on the test set. The MCC value of model 1B was
also more than those of the other models. This suggested that the
prediction performance of model 1B was better than other models. PubChem
fingerprints are more suitable for the classification of the inhibitors
by the k-NN method.

Classification Models Built
Using a DT
Three classification
models were computed using a DT, model 2A by MACCS fingerprints, model
2B by PubChem fingerprints, and model 2C using CORINA Symphony descriptors.
Model 2B which was built based on PubChem fingerprint descriptors
performed best with the accuracies of 78.01% on the test set, 89.52%
on the training set, and 79.57% by a 5-fold cross-validation. For
the MCC value, model 2B was also more than those of the other DT models.
It revealed that PubChem fingerprints are more suitable for the classification
of the inhibitors using the DT method.

Classification Models Built
Using a RF
Three classification
models were developed using a RF method, model 3A based on MACCS fingerprints,
model 3B by PubChem fingerprints, and model 3C using CORINA Symphony
descriptors. Model 3A which was built based on MACCS fingerprint descriptors
showed the best accuracy of 80.35% of on the test set. The accuracy
of the training set and 5-fold cross-validation for model 3A and model
3B were higher than those of model 3C. The MCC value of model 3A was
equal to that of model 3B, which was also higher than those of models
3C. MACCS and PubChem fingerprints showed good classification performance
for the inhibitors using the RF method.

Classification Models Built
Using a SVM
Three classification
models were constructed using a SVM, model 4A by MACCS fingerprints,
model 4B by PubChem fingerprints, and model 4C using CORINA Symphony
descriptors. For the results of the models, model 4A which was built
based on MACCS fingerprints descriptors showed a better performance
with accuracies of 92.31 and 83.07% on the training set and the test
set, respectively. Model 4B based on PubChem fingerprint descriptors
obtained a higher accuracy of 83.37% by 5-fold cross-validation than
those of the others. The MCC values of model 4A and model 4B were
higher than that of model 4C. Model 4A and model 4B showed a better
classification ability of the inhibitors.

Classification Models Built
Using a DNN
Three classification
models were developed using a DNN, model 5A by MACCS fingerprints,
model 5B by PubChem fingerprints, and model 5C using CORINA Symphony
descriptors. In the process of parameter selection, the number of
neurons per hidden layer can be different. We set the number of neurons
per hidden layer at the same number from 2 to 210; the
prediction results of the models are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows the accuracies for the training set and the
test set obtained by the models on the basis of MACCS fingerprints,
PubChem fingerprints, and CORINA Symphony descriptors using the DNN
method. From Figure 2, we can see that the accuracy increases with the number of neurons
when the number of neurons per layer was less than 400. Then, the
accuracy changed little with the increase of the number of neurons.
From Figure 2b, one
can see that when the number of neurons was more than 200, there is
an obvious overfitting for the models. The PubChem fingerprints include
881 substructure patterns. More features mean more complicated calculations
for the model compared with MACCS fingerprints and CORINA Symphony
descriptors. Then, there are less data for each feature available
to complete the training process. To avoid overfitting, a “drop-out”
procedure, which drops some neurons in each batch, can be imported
to the training process.34 However, the
overfitting still existed when the number of neurons was more than
200; the reason may be that the number of data is not enough for the
PubChem fingerprints by the DNN method.

Figure 2 Accuracy of the training
set and test set obtained by the models
based on (a) MACCS fingerprints, (b) PubChem fingerprints, and (c)
CORINA Symphony descriptors using the DNN method.

Model 5A built based on MACCS fingerprint descriptors showed
a
better accuracy of 82.27% on the test set than those of the other
models. The accuracy of the training set and 5-fold cross-validation
for model 5B were higher than those of models 5A and 5C. The MCC values
of model 5A and model 5B were higher than those of model 5C. For the
DNN models, MACCS and PubChem fingerprints are suitable to classify
the inhibitors.

For all of the models established by k-NN, DT,
RF, SVM, and DNN, the prediction accuracies on the test set are higher
than 70% based on the data set. Model 4A which was built by SVM based
on MACCS fingerprints was the best model in view of the accuracy of
83.07% and the MCC of 0.65 on the test set. From the point of average
prediction accuracy and MCC on the test set of the models, SVM performed
better than other methods. The results of DNN models were close to
those of SVM models.

Performance of the Consensus Models
In this work, three
kinds of different descriptors (CORINA Symphony descriptors, MACCS
fingerprints descriptors, and PubChem fingerprints descriptors) were
used as input of the models. For each kind of input descriptors such
as MACCS fingerprints descriptors, five individual models (model 1A,
model 2A, model 3A, model 4A, and model 5A) were obtained by using
the k-NN, DT, RF, SVM, and DNN methods, respectively.
On the basis of the results of five models (model 1, 2, 3, 4,and 5A),
three consensus models (model C3a, model C4a, and model C5a) were computed for the training and test
set. For each compound, if the prediction results for more than three
of the five individual models are correct, the consensus models result
is “TRUE”, otherwise it is “FALSE”. We
named this model as “model C3a”. Similarly,
we performed model C4a (more than four of the five individual
classification model predictions are correct) and model C5a (all of the five individual classification model predictions are
correct). The results of consensus models are presented in Table 4. For the average
accuracy, model C3a–c constructed by the C3 consensus
prediction method (more than three of the five single classification
model predictions are correct) obtained higher accuracy. Model C3a developed with MACCS fingerprint descriptors showed the highest
accuracy on both training set (91.96%) and test set (83.15%). As for
the C4 consensus prediction method, model C4b built with
PubChem fingerprint descriptors showed the highest accuracy on both
training set (87.64%) and test set (77.41%). As for the C5 consensus
prediction method, the highest performance was obtained for the model
C5b, which was developed using PubChem fingerprint descriptors.
More than half of all of the compounds were predicted correctly by
the consensus model C5a, C5b, and C5c, which indicated that the models built in this work are stable.
As for the descriptors, the fingerprint descriptors performed better
than CORINA Symphony descriptors for the prediction of the compounds
in both training and test set with all consensus prediction methods.

Analysis of Molecular Descriptors
To examine the role
of the descriptors, we calculated F-score for fingerprints
and the CORINA Symphony descriptors. Table 5 shows the top 10 fingerprints sorted by F-score and the representative substructures. The top 10
fingerprints sorted by F-score include two MACCS
fingerprints and 8 PubChem fingerprints. We also calculated the frequency
of substructures that appeared in the PI-positive and PI-negative.
The fingerprint MACCSFP 133 obtains the highest F-score value, which represents the three atoms including one nitrogen
atom linked by a ring bond and a chain bond (shown in Table 5). The frequencies of MACCSFP
133 that appears in the PI-positive and the PI-negative were 50.00
and 24.19%, respectively, and the difference was 28.81%. In Table 6, the differences
of eight substructures are more than 20%. The 10 fragments give a
positive contribution to bioactivity. From Table 6, one can see that 9 of the 10 fingerprints
substructures include a nitrogen atom and one includes an oxygen atom.
Five of the 10 fingerprint substructures include an aromatic ring.

Table 6 shows the
CCs to activity and the F-Score of 52 selected CORINA
Symphony descriptors. We divided the descriptors into seven classes.
Class A includes nine descriptors which described molecular size,
shape, and solubility. The descriptors of class B are related to π
atom charges and electronegativities. The descriptors of class C are
related to σ atom charges and electronegativities. Class D included
nine descriptors which are related to lone pair electronegativities.
Class E includes two descriptors which describe the total charge (sum
of σ and π charges). The descriptors of class F are related
to hydrogen bonding. The descriptors of class G describe effective
atom polarizabilities. The descriptors of the seven classes represent
the molecular size and shape, charges, and electronegativities.

The interactions between the inhibitors and HIV-1 protease are
revealed in Figure 3. Figure 3a depicts
the interactions between indinavir and protease (PDB code: 2BPX).35 The oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group makes up a hydrogen
bond with Asp 25 at two sites of the amino acid chain. The other oxygen
atom of hydroxy forms two hydrogen bonds with Asp 29 and Gly 27 at
chain B. The aromatic ring forms π–π stacking interactions
with Val 82 at chain A. Figure 3b depicts the structure and interactions between the ligand
8FP and protease (PDB code: 5UOV).27 The ligand has shown Ki of 0.025 nM with the enzyme.27 The oxygen atom of the hydroxy group forms two hydrogen
bonds with Asp 25 at two sites of amino acids chain. The oxygen atom
of the acylamino group forms a hydrogen bond with Asp 29 at chain
B. The aromatic ring forms π–π stacking interactions
with Ala 28 at chain B. As shown in Figure 3, hydrogen bond and π–π
stacking interactions are important interactions. The descriptors
of class B, class D, and class F confirm that an aromatic system and
atoms related to hydrogen bonding are important for the bioactivity
of PIs.

Analysis of Prediction Results
For
the 1619 molecules
in the test set, 1608 compounds were correctly predicted by at least
one of the 15 models. Only 11 molecules (CHEMBL122388, CHEMBL71218,
CHEMBL194770, CHEMBL87092, CHEMBL313955, CHEMBL187387, CHEMBL94078,
CHEMBL112846, CHEMBL323014, CHEMBL73875, and CHEMBL424415) were wrongly
predicted by all of the 15 models. Their molecular structures are
shown in Figure 4.
The molecular structures of CHEMBL122388, CHEMBL71218, CHEMBL187387,
CHEMBL94078, CHEMBL112846, CHEMBL323014, and CHEMBL73875 do not contain
these important fragments which are shown in Table 4. Because of the lack of these important
fragments, the prediction of the compounds was not good. The bioactivity
of CHEMBL194770 is on the edge of the threshold. This may be the reason
for the error. CHEMBL122388 and CHEMBL71218 have the same scaffold
of pyrone group. CHEMBL87092 and CHEMBL313955 are fluorinated compounds.
CHEMBL187387 and CHEMBL94078 have substituted phenylethylamine groups.
CHEMBL112846, CHEMBL323014, CHEMBL73875, and CHEMBL424415 are peptides
with a somehow larger MW. For these scaffolds of molecules, it is
suggested that the prediction ability could be improved by increasing
the number of similar molecules in the training set.

predicted incorrectly by all 15 models in
this study.

Predicted Results of External
Validation Set
The 35
750 decoys, which are all assumed to be inactive compounds against
HIV-1 protease from the DUD database, and 239 inhibitors collected
from the literature were collected as an external validation set.
The external validation set contained different types of compounds,
such as the derivatives bearing oxazolylmethyl or thiazolylmethyl,
the compounds binding bicyclic piperazine sulfonamide core, and so
forth. The molecular structures of 239 active inhibitors are shown
in the Supporting Information. All of the
models built in this work were used to predict the external validation
set. The predicted results are shown in Table 7. Model 3C which was built by the RF method
based on CORINA Symphony descriptors obtained the best accuracy of
98.37% for the external validation set. For the average accuracy,
the RF models were higher than the other models. SVM and DNN models
were not as good as RF models, but they were better than the DT models.
As for the descriptors, CORINA Symphony descriptors performed better
than the fingerprint descriptors for the prediction of the compounds
in the external validation set with all methods. The SP values are
higher than SE values for most models. It indicated that the models
have better predictive ability for negative compounds. The prediction
ability for positive compounds could be improved by increasing the
number of similar active inhibitors in the training set.

Conclusions
Four thousand eight
hundred and fifty five molecules and their
bioactivities (IC50/Ki) for
HIV-1 protease were collected from ChEMBL as the data set for this
work. The data set was separated into a training set including 3236
molecules and a test set including 1619 molecules. An external validation
set including 35 989 compounds was also used to validate the models.
In the process of building models, k-NN, DT, RF,
SVM, and DNN were used to identify HIV-1 protease active inhibitors.
In addition, we created consensus models that combine the k-NN, DT, RF, SVM, and DNN models using the “consensus
prediction”. CORINA Symphony and fingerprint descriptors including
MACCS fingerprints and PubChem fingerprints were used to characterize
the molecular structure features. For the prediction results of the
test set, the SVM models performed better than the models of the other
methods. The prediction results of the test set obtained by the DNN
models were nearly as good as the prediction results obtained by the
SVM models. For the consensus models, model C3a developed
with MACCS fingerprint descriptors showed the highest accuracy on
both training set (91.96%) and test set (83.15%). For the prediction
results of the external validation set, the RF models performed better
than the others models. The prediction results of the external validation
set obtained by the SVM and DNN models were nearly as good as the
prediction results obtained by the RF models. The fingerprints were
suitable for establishing classification models in view of the prediction
results on the test set. Considering the prediction results on the
external validation set, CORINA Symphony descriptors were the best
for classification models of PIs. From the analysis of the descriptors,
we found that an aromatic system and atoms involved in hydrogen bonding
contribute to the bioactivity of PIs. Taking all of these observations
together, we would recommend using the SVM method based on MACCS fingerprints
as a compromise for the prediction of PI activity of a compound.
