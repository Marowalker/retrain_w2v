Graphene, a single
atom layer of carbon atoms, provides a two-dimensional
platform with an extremely high sensitivity to charges due to its
unique band structure and high surface-to-volume ratio. Graphene field-effect
transistor (G-FET) biosensors have, indeed, demonstrated a detection
limit of subnanomolar or even subpicomolar. However, in G-FET, signal
is averaged throughout the whole channel, so there remains a need
to visualize the spatial distribution of target molecules on a single
G-FET, to provide further insight into target molecules and/or biological
functions. Here, we made use of graphene as an imaging platform of
charged molecules via Raman microscopy. Positively (or negatively)
charged microbeads with a diameter of 1 μm were dispersed in
a buffer solution and were attached on graphene. We found out that
Raman peaks of graphene, where positively (or negatively) charged
beads contacted, were up-shifted (or down-shifted) significantly,
indicating that the carrier density in the graphene was locally modulated
by the charged beads and the charge state of the beads was represented
by the peak-shift direction. From the peak shift, the change in the
carrier density was calculated to be +1.4 × 1012 cm–2 (or −1.0 × 1012 cm–2). By taking Raman peak-shift images, we visualized distribution
of charged molecules on graphene with a spatial resolution below 1
μm. The technique described here overcomes the limitation of
spatial resolution of G-FET and provides a new route to graphene-based
chemical and biosensors.

Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional
(2D) sheet of hexagonally arranged
carbon atoms, offers an ideal sensing platform owing to its 2D nature
and its unique band structure. The 2D nature creates a uniform and
large sensing field with ultrahigh sensitivity to charges because
every atom in a graphene sheet makes contact with its environment.
Therefore, even a few chemical dopants can lead to significant modulation
of its carrier (electron or hole) density. In graphene field-effect
transistor (G-FET) sensors, where graphene is used as a channel, a
change in the carrier density is monitored as a drain current change.
There have been reports on G-FET sensors showing successful detections
of various gases,1 ions,2 biomolecules,3 and so on. However,
in G-FET, the signal is averaged throughout the whole channel, so
that spatial information of target molecules on G-FET cannot be obtained,
and the signal is canceled out if both positively and negatively charged
molecules are adsorbed in a single FET sensor. There are several methods
to see local charge puddles in graphene with a high spatial resolution,
including local potential Kelvin probe microscopy4 and scanning single-electron transistors.5 Here, we made use of graphene as an imaging platform of
charged molecules via Raman microscopy. Raman microscopy is a noncontact,
nondestructive, and label-free imaging technique with a spatial resolution
below 1 μm and can be applied to samples in liquid environment,
used to analyze biological materials,6 nanocarbon
materials,7 polymers,8 and so on. Furthermore, it has been known that a change
in the carrier density in graphene appears as distinct Raman peak
shifts.9 Thus, by monitoring the peak shifts,
local chemical dopants on graphene can be visualized via Raman microscopy.
This method also enables one to investigate the charge state of biomolecules
in liquid. Indeed, Paulus et al. have demonstrated a biological cell
monitoring on graphene via Raman microscopy.10 We conducted our study with polystyrene (PS) beads of known ζ
potential and demonstrated that a graphene imaging platform can visualize
both positively and negatively charged molecules.

Results and Discussion
Analysis
about Raman Images of Graphene Films under a Buffer
Solution
To ensure that graphene provides a uniform imaging
platform in a liquid environment, we took Raman images of graphene
films using Raman microscopy. The schematic experimental setup is
depicted in Figure 1a. A phthalate buffer solution at pH = 4 (50 mM, Horiba) was dropped
on graphene films. Figure 1b shows a typical Raman spectrum of graphene. The peak parameters
are determined using the Lorentz function. The Raman spectrum shows
distinctive peaks at 1591, 2686, and 1341 cm–1 assigned
to G-band, 2D-band, and D-band of graphene, respectively. The peak
at 2329 cm–1 is assigned to N2 in air,
which does not disturb Raman analysis of graphene. The intensity ratio
of the G-band to 2D-band (IG/I2D) and the full width at half-maximum of 2D-band (Γ2D) are calculated to be 0.64 and 29 cm–1, respectively. The symmetric Lorentzian line shape of the 2D-band
indicates that the graphene films are a single layer.11Figure 1c,d shows Raman images constructed by IG and I2D, respectively. The Raman images
clearly show that the obtained graphene films were uniform throughout
the imaged area. To study more in detail, the Raman spectrum variance
is investigated by making histograms of G-band peak position (Gpos) and 2D-band peak position (2Dpos; Figure 1e,f). The
deviation in the peak positions was sufficiently small (<2 cm–1), which supports that the graphene provides a uniform
imaging platform. The deviation is likely attributed to the inhomogeneous
charged impurities in the SiO2 substrate.12

To prove that Raman spectrum
of graphene is sensitive to the carrier
density change, we changed the carrier density by changing the pH
of the buffer solution on graphene and investigated Raman spectrum
of graphene. It is known that a pH change leads to a modulation of
the carrier density of graphene.2 Raman
images of the graphene films were taken at pH = 4 (phthalate buffer,
50 mM, Horiba), 7 (phosphate buffer, 25 mM, Horiba), and 9 (tetraborate
buffer, 10 mM, Horiba). The averaged Raman spectra throughout the
Raman images (see Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information) are shown in Figure 2a–c. The results clearly show that both Gpos and 2Dpos are down-shifted with
increasing pH. In contrast, no shift was observed at D-band and at
the 2329 cm–1 peak assigned to N2, as
expected. In addition to the peak position, the IG/I2D is also sensitive to
the carrier density change. The IG/I2D as a function of pH is plotted in Figure 2d, showing that IG/I2D decreases
with pH increase. The reliability was confirmed using Student’s t test with probability limits of p <
0.01. On the other hand, Γ2D did not show pH dependence,
as shown in Figure 2e, because Γ2D is not sensitive to the carrier density
change.13 Both the down shift of Gpos and 2Dpos and the decrease in IG/I2D are attributed
to decrease in the carrier density in graphene.13 At high pH, deprotonated ions are adsorbed on graphene,2,14 which should lead to either increase in holes or decrease in electrons
in graphene. As the Raman data indicate carrier density decrease at
high pH, we concluded that the graphene films were n-doped in our
system, where the graphene films were electrically floated under the
buffer solution.

of pH. The asterisk in (d) indicates the values are statistically
different (p < 0.01). Each point represents the
average value throughout the Raman images (Figure S1). The error bar represents the standard deviation.

To provide further insights, we
proved the reversible nature of
the carrier density modulation by pH change. A buffer solution on
the graphene films was replaced from pH = 4, 7, 9, 7, to 4, sequentially,
and Raman images of the graphene films were taken at each condition
(Figure S2). Figure 3 presents the transient response of the averaged Gpos against pH change. Averaged Gpos was calculated from the Raman images in Figure S2. The result shows that Gpos is monotonically down-shifted (up-shifted) with increasing
(decreasing) pH, although there is a small offset shift probably due
to insufficient rinsing such that some buffer solution residue remained.
The validity was confirmed using Student’s t test with probability limit of p < 0.01. The
tests show that the Gpos at different
pHs is statistically different from each other. It is also found that
2Dpos is monotonically down-shifted with increasing pH
(Figure S3). The sensitivity of 2Dpos against pH change is smaller than that of Gpos, in agreement with the previous report13 showing that 2Dpos against carrier
density modulation is less sensitive compared to Gpos. Figure 3 also indicates that the Gpos instantly
follows the pH change, which may lead to real-time monitoring of chemical
dopants on graphene.

Visualization of Charged Molecular Distribution via Raman Imaging
of Graphene Films
Finally, we demonstrated a detection of
locally modulated carrier density via Raman microscopy using charged
microbeads. Negatively charged polystyrene (PS) beads (1 μm
diameter, surface density of COOH ∼2 × 1013 cm–2, micromod GmbH) were dispersed in a buffer
solution at pH = 7. At pH = 7, the ζ potential of the beads
was about −30 mV and thus were negatively charged in the solution. Figure 4a shows a Raman image
constructed by IG. The PS beads were clearly
observed as bright spots in Figure 4a, proving that our method has a high spatial resolution
(down to 1 μm). The Raman image constructed by Gpos is also shown in Figure 4b. The image shows that Gpos where the PS beads are located is lower than that
without PS beads. The down shift indicates that the negatively charged
beads moved electrons away in the graphene, where beads were in contact.
Typical Raman spectra taken from the area with and without casted
PS beads are shown in Figure 4c. A peak at 3160 cm–1 is assigned to aromatic
CH vibration in PS beads,15 confirming
that Raman signal from the beads was detectable even on graphene.
It is interesting to note that the intensity ratio of the G-band to
D-band (IG/ID) with PS beads (∼1.64) was smaller than that without PS beads
(∼2.67). This result also supports that the PS beads locally
modulate carrier density in graphene, resulting in the local scatters.
The averaged Gpos and 2Dpos with beads area are calculated to be 1594.7 and 2689.4, respectively,
and the averaged Gpos and 2Dpos without beads area are calculated to be 1595.8 and 2690.3, respectively. Gpos is correlated to its electron density ne through eq 1(13,16) 1  where
ΔGpos is the frequency shift from Gpos0 = 1581 cm–113 of graphene
where ne is equal to hole density (nh) and νF = 1.1 × 106 ms–1 is the Fermi velocity.17,18 By substituting ΔGpos in eq 1, the ne can be calculated to
be 8.0 × 1012 cm–2 for graphene
with beads and 9.0 × 1012 cm–2 without
beads, yielding a decrease in ne of 1.0
× 1012 cm–2 by external potential
of the beads. In addition to a decrease in ne, mechanical strain may also attribute to the peak shifts
of Gpos and 2Dpos. According
to the previous reports,13,19−21 the peaks were up-shifted along a slope of Δ2Dpos/ΔGpos = 2.2 under tensile strain
and up-shifted along a slope of Δ2Dpos/ΔGpos = 0.2 under increase in ne. Therefore, the peak shifts (ΔGpos, Δ2Dpos) can be decomposed into the
contribution of ne modulation and mechanical
strain. It was found that the contribution of ne decrease to the peak shifts of (−1.1, −0.9
cm–1) was 69% and the rest was induced by compressive
strain.

polystyrene (PS) beads constructed by IG (a) and Gpos (b). The scale bar is 2
μm. (c–e) Typical Raman spectra with beads (blue) and
without beads (red) (c) and the enlarged spectra in G-band region
(d) and 2D-band region (e).

To ensure that the peak shifts were truly caused by the charge
of the beads, we carried out a control experiment using positively
charged beads. Positively charged PS beads (1 μm diameter, surface
density of NR3+ ∼ 2 × 1013 cm–2, micromod GmbH) were dispersed in a buffer
solution at pH = 4, where the ζ potential of the beads was about
+32 mV. Raman images constructed by IG and by Gpos are shown in Figure 5a,b. The image in Figure 5b shows that Gpos where the PS beads are located is higher
than that without PS beads, as opposed to the data in Figure 4. The scatter plot in Figure 5c also clearly shows
that both Gpos and 2Dpos are
shifted toward high frequency with beads. From these results, we confirmed
that the peak shifts were truly related to local increase/decrease
in ne due to the charged beads. In addition,
we can conclude that Raman microscopy can visualize the locally modulated ne of graphene. The averaged Gpos and 2Dpos with beads are calculated to
be 1596.5 and 2691.6, respectively. Also, the averaged Gpos and 2Dpos without beads are calculated
to be 1595.1 and 2689.1, respectively. Therefore, using eq 1, we found that the ne with beads was higher by 1.4 × 1012 cm–2 than that without beads. This value is close to that
obtained using negatively charged beads, although the sign is opposite.
This result is reasonable as the absolute values of the ζ potential
of the beads are close with each other (−30 and +32 mV). The
vector decomposition into mechanical strain and ne modulation was also applied for the peak shifts (1.4,
2.5 cm–1). It was found that the contribution of ne increase to the peak shifts was 20% and the
rest was induced by tensile strain. The reason why the mechanical
strain estimated from (ΔGpos, Δ2Dpos) was in opposite direction between positively and negatively
charged beads may be due to the limited accuracy of Δ2Dpos, and this issue will be addressed in the future study.

deviation.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have measured the ne change
of graphene via Raman microscopy, using the 2D nature and
high sensitivity of graphene. Both Gpos and 2Dpos shifted responding to changes in pH. We have
also found the locally modulated ne by
charged PS microbeads. The charged molecular distribution on graphene
was imaged with a spatial resolution of submicrometer. The sensitivity
relies on the Debye length in an analogous fashion of G-FET biosensors.22 We used buffer solutions of concentrations of
50 mM (pH = 4) and 25 mM (pH = 7), and so the Debye length is estimated
to be 1 and 2 nm, respectively. This means that only charged molecules
within the Debye length (<2 nm) will affect the local carrier density
modulation, even though the diameter of the charged beads is 1 μm.
Even in this condition, the results show that the Raman peaks were
shifted by ∼1 cm–1, which represents that
our method exhibits very high sensitivity. To further improve the
sensitivity, some super-resolution techniques, including structured
illumination Raman microscopy23 or tip-enhanced
Raman microscopy,24 may be applied to our
method. In addition, hexagonal boron nitride may be applied to suppress
inhomogeneous charged impurities underneath graphene films,12 which may also lead to further enhancement in
the sensitivity of our method. Because our method is a noncontact,
nondestructive, and label-free measurement and is applicable to a
liquid environment, it is possible to combine the system with G-FET
biosensors, which will expand the application range of G-FET. Furthermore,
although Raman spectroscopy generally provides no information regarding
charge state of target molecules, we can find out qualitative information
by putting them on a graphene imaging platform. Our technique described
here, thus, opens the door to a more versatile sensing platform for
biomolecules and biological functions.

Materials and Methods
Graphene films were grown on Cu foils by chemical vapor deposition.
To transfer the graphene films to Si/SiO2 substrates, a
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution was coated and subsequently
the Cu foils were etched away using an ammonium persulfate solution.
PMMA/graphene films were transferred onto Si/SiO2 substrates
and finally PMMA was dissolved using acetone. The obtained graphene
films were studied.

Raman analysis of graphene films was carried
out using Raman microscopy
(Raman-11, Nanophoton Corp.). A laser beam emitting at 532 nm was
used for the excitation. The laser beam was focused by an objective
lens (100×, NA 0.9, Nikon) onto the graphene films. The resolution
of the spectrometer was about 4 cm–1 with the grating
of 600 line/mm. It should be noted that the inaccuracy of determination
of the peak position is much smaller than the resolution when the
spectral shape is known. Laser intensity and exposure time were optimized
to take Raman spectra with sufficient signal to noise ratio.
