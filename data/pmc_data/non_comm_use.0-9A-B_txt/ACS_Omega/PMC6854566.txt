For
potential applications such as suppressing the onset of peri-implant
infections, a doped titania coating was developed to induce free radical
release because of its ability for microbial elimination. The coatability
of the sol–gel precursor is robust since the suspension’s
rheology can be modified to attain uniform and complete surface coverage.
The coating is composed of a mixture of anatase and rutile polymorphs
doped with nitrogen (N3–), and it contains substoichiometric
Ti2+ and Ti3+ species. Nitrogen doping results
in a 0.4 eV band gap shift, while the defects induce photocurrent
generation under visible light excitation up to 650 nm. Greater currents
were observed in the nitrogen-doped titania at wavelengths above 450
nm vis-à-vis its (singularly) self-doped counterparts. The
(photo)electrochemical behavior and photoactivity of the coating were
evaluated by assessing redox species formation in a background aqueous
solution. In the absence of any illumination, the coating behaved
as an insulator and inhibited the activities of both oxidative and
reductive species. On the other hand, under illumination, the coating
enhances oxidation processes and inhibits reduction reactions within
a near-field region wherein release of free radicals occurs and is
constrained (delimited).

==== Body
Introduction
Titanium-based alloys are ubiquitously
used as dental implant materials.
However, the infection of implants, an increasingly common occurrence,
is problematic because of the difficulties associated with surgical
intervention or (in)effective chemical treatments.1 Recently, it has been shown that photoactive TiO2 coatings can prevent microbial infections.2−4 This self-cleaning
(bactericidal) attribute is on account of the photoactivity displayed
by TiO2 under illumination5 1  where h is
Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of incident light,
and e– and h+ are electrons and electron
holes, respectively. The photoexcited e––h+ pair can react with aqueous species to produce free radicals,
for example, HO, O2–, and H2O2, which are detrimental to microbes.6 As body tissues are penetrable by visible light,7 the radical-generation ability of TiO2 could be exploited to develop an in situ and light-activated coating
for implants that would prevent infections. Importantly, the potential
risks posed to body tissues following exposure to ultraviolet light
and its limited penetration depth (<0.5 mm), that is, vis-à-vis
visible light (0.5–10 mm),7 create
opportunities for new coatings sensitive to visible light illumination.
Among all modifications, nitrogen doping8 and self-defected species (i.e., that are formed by introducing
substoichiometric Ti2+ and Ti3+ species)9 appear most promising to impart visible light
activity to TiO2 because they do not use toxic elements
that may jeopardize an implant’s (bio)compatibility.

A cost-effective way to coat an implant with doped TiO2 is via a dip-coating process using a sol–gel precursor.10 By this method, dopants can be added to the
coating precursor, and the produced coating can be designed to possess
excellent photocatalytic properties and biocompatibility. However,
depending on the coating conditions, the integrity of the produced
coating may be diminished if cracks are to form or if only partial
surface coverage is achieved.11 The in
situ treatment of an infected implant is eased if a uniformly applied
coating is sensitive to visible light. In addition to the coating’s
uniformity, another pending concern is that free radicals (e.g., hydroxyl
free radical (HO·): h+ + H2O
→ H+ + HO) that are generated via the photoelectrolysis
of water may not only sterilize the infected area but can also damage
adjacent body tissues.12,13

Therefore, it is important
to ensure that photocatalytically generated
radical species are confined, for example, to the region in the proximate
vicinity of the implant. To better understand these aspects, herein,
scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is used to probe the effects
of free radicals produced by the coating when it is exposed to a light
source. Since free radicals are electrochemically active and can alter
reduction and oxidation (redox) reaction rates, SECM detects the reactivity
of redox species as a function of distance from the coating to provide
insights regarding the spatial distribution of the photogenerated
radicals. This allows evaluation of the effects of photostimulation
in the proximate (e.g., peri-implant) region that is expected to be
most affected by free radical species.

Results and Discussion
Precursor
Rheology and Coatability
In general, the
coating morphologies observed are closely related to the extent of
aging of the precursor. As indicated in Figure 1, the uncoated areas exhibit dark blue and
purple regions resembling the control surface while the coated areas
show interference patterns of visible light indicative of a transparent
coating. Unsurprisingly, large cracks and uncoated areas persisted
in coatings wherein the precursor was aged for less than 48 h. But with
prolonged aging, surface coverage greatly improved such that, following
48 h of aging, superior coating attributes were observed. For example,
as shown in Figure 1e, following 48 h of aging, a uniform and crack-free coating was
formed.

formed following aging of the precursor solution for (b) 15 min, (c)
6 h, (d) 24 h, and (e) 48 h. (a) Surface of a control sample exposed
to the same heat treatment as the coatings.

The precursor solution’s properties evolve during aging
resulting in improved coatability. For example, as seen in Figure 2, the highest viscosity
of 85 mPa·s was attained after the two precursor solutions are
initially titrated. During aging, while stirring at a constant rate,
the viscosity decreased to 9 mPa·s after 48 h. The high initial
viscosity is on account of the consumption of the viscous titanium(IV)
isopropoxide resulting in the formation of a polymerized gel network
containing Ti4+ ions. However, the ζ potential of
the gel particles increased from near neutral charge until it saturated
at a positive potential around 30 mV. The positive surface potential
results in electrostatic repulsion of the gel particles away from
each other. As a result, the system’s viscosity decreased progressively
with aging.

of the gel-agglomerates with increasing aging.

Phase Composition
The thickness and composition of
the coating formed following aging of the precursor solution for 48
h (“48 h NTO coating”) were characterized using SEM-EDS.
In general, the 48 h NTO coating is 4 μm thick (Figure 3a) and contains titania with
12 ± 2 mass % nitrogen. The lattice structure of the 48 h NTO
coating and the control surfaces were characterized using X-ray diffraction
(XRD). The diffraction patterns (Figure 3b) only show diffraction peaks associated
with the substrate (α-titanium) but display no response from
the coating or the thermal oxidation layers. In contrast, the P25
powder exhibits clear diffraction peaks mainly of anatase and trace
amount of rutile; meanwhile, the powder synthesized using the 48 h
aged sol–gel precursor (“48 h NTO powder”) exhibits
only anatase’s pattern. The peak broadening observed for the
48 h NTO powder as compared to the sharp peaks displayed in the P25
pattern implies reduced ordering/crystallinity in the former case.
The 48 h NTO coating itself too is expected to feature the same low
crystallinity. Thus, on account of the small thicknesses of the coated
(around 4 μm; see Figure 3a) and the thermal (less than 100 nm14) oxidation layers, Raman spectroscopy was used to acquire detailed
phase compositions.

of
the coating formed following aging of the precursor solution for 48
h (i.e., the 48 h NTO coating). (b) X-ray diffraction patterns of
the 48 h NTO coating, the control surface, 48 h NTO powder, and the
P25 powder.

Raman spectroscopy enabled clear
differentiation of the different
titania phases that formed on coated surfaces, as opposed to the thermal
oxidation film that formed on uncoated, exposed regions. For example,
simple thermal oxidation of the Ti-0.2%Pd alloy produced rutile-structured
titania (Figure 4a)
that features peaks at Raman shifts of 247, 438, and 607 cm–1.15 The presence of TiN that features
peaks at 210, 307, and 568 cm–116 suggests its formation during the heat treatment. Importantly,
no carbide residues were detected indicating that any solvents used
were fully evaporated during synthesis. The Raman spectra of the coated
surfaces (Figure 4b)
show predominantly anatase peaks at 148, 199, 396, 516, and 635 cm–1.15 However and significantly,
the Raman spectrum of the 48 h aged coating features strong peaks
suggesting the presence of intermixed anatase and rutile polymorphs,
which are present in similar abundance. The presence of rutile on
uncoated (thermally treated) surfaces is expected as it is the more
thermally stable phase.17 Anatase, on the
other hand, is typically produced by sol–gel processing or
anodizing Ti-alloys and subsequently annealing them at relatively
low temperatures (e.g., below 500 °C).18 However, if the annealing temperature exceeds 450 °C, a thin
layer of rutile may form between the anatase coating and the substrate
explaining the indication of both oxides in the Raman spectra (see Figure 3b).19 The formation of the intermediate rutile layer, which often
features a higher electrical resistance and corrosion resistance,
is complemented by the outer anatase layer, which favors osseointegration
(i.e., bone integration).20 Most importantly,
mixed-phase titania consisting of both anatase and rutile is well
known to offer superior photocatalytic performance vis-à-vis
single phase compositions.21

on uncoated exposed substrates and (b) coated surfaces. The peaks
at (i) 210, 307, and 568 cm–1 indicate TiN16 (denoted by red arrows), (ii) 247, 438, and
607 cm–1 indicate rutile (blue arrows), and (iii)
148, 199, 396, 516, and 635 cm–1 indicate anatase
(black arrows).15

In addition to phase composition, light absorption depends on band
structures and how they may be modified by dopants.18 The chemical and valence information of elements contained
in the thermal and coated oxides as analyzed by XPS is shown in Figure 5 and Table 1. Based on the Ti 2p spectra,
the calcination process induced the formation of lower valence (“substoichiometric”)
titanium species, Ti2+ and Ti3+, in the coating
(Figure 5d) through
a process resembling the thermal oxidation of the control surface
(Figure 5a). This oxidation
process is governed by the diffusion of cation interstitials and anion
vacancies in accordance with the point defect model.22 When the rate of generation of cation interstitials at
the substrate/coating interface is greater than the annihilation rate
of stoichiometric anion vacancies at the coating/air interface, excessive
interstitials will form in oxide compounds in the form of Ti2+ and Ti3+ species. These lower valence (substoichiometric)
Ti ions exist in the form of point defects and also cause the surrounding
O ions to be detected as defect-O (Figure 5b,e). The significant concentrations of Ti2+ and Ti3+ dopants in the coating (see Table 1) suggest that the
coating is diffusion-bonded with the substrate.

Nitrogen was added to the coating
precursor to serve as a dopant
to extend the photoactivity of titania into the visible light range.
First, expectedly, the N 1s spectrum from the control surface (Figure 5c) shows no established
peak, suggesting that the nitrogen content of the thermal oxide is
insignificant. However, since nitrogen is added to the coating precursor,
the N 1s photoelectron peak of the coating (Figure 5f) shows a notable peak confirming that the
coating not only is self-doped but is also nitrogen-doped. This nature
of mixed doping results in interstitial band structures that enhance
the absorption of visible light with longer wavelengths as has been
highlighted previously.23

UV–vis
Absorbance and Photocurrent Measurements
The photoactivity
enhancements of titania resulting from the nitrogen
doping was investigated by comparing the UV–vis absorbances
of the 48 h NTO and the P25 powders. The UV–vis absorption
spectra (Figure 6a)
signify a clear enhancement in visible light (wavelength > 380
nm)
absorption on account of nitrogen doping. The band gap energies of
the powders were analyzed by converting the absorbance spectra to
the Tauc plot24 with the photon energy, hν, shown on the x axis and (αhν)0.5 on the y axis,
where α is the absorbance coefficient, h is
Planck’s constant, and ν is the photon’s frequency.
As indicated Figure 6b, the 48 h NTO powder shows a band gap energy that is around 0.4
eV lower than the P25 powder, as expected because of its nitrogen
doping18 and lower crystallinity.25

Figure 6 (a) UV–vis absorbance spectra of the nitrogen doped
(48
h NTO) and the undoped (P25) powders. (b) Tauc plots showing
that the band gap energies for the N-doped and P25 titania powders
are 2.6 and 3.0 eV, respectively.

To evaluate the photocatalytic behavior of the coating, photocurrents
were measured in a DPBS solution while the surfaces were held at 0
VAg/AgCl, that is, a potential close to the open circuit
potentials. Figure 7a shows the photocurrent responses of both uncoated and coated surfaces
during illumination. The photocurrent profile during a single “off–on–off”
cycle is shown in Figure 7b. The current spikes following photoexcitation signify the
fast generation of e––h+ pairs,
and the subsequent recombination of e––h+ pairs resulted in the current decay until a steady-state
current was attained.26 Expectedly, significant
photocurrents were generated from both the coated and uncoated samples
up on illumination by blue light (λ = 450 nm) since both of
these surfaces contain oxides that are self-doped with Ti2+ and Ti3+ species. The coated sample show higher spike
and steady-state currents at wavelengths less than 450 nm. At greater
wavelengths, both surfaces show diminished steady-state currents below
20 nA/cm2; however, the photocurrents measured from the
coated surface are consistently higher than the uncoated surface due
to its nitrogen doping.

profiles of the substrates illuminated under the 415 nm (purple) light.
(c) The steady-state photocurrent density as a function of the wavelength

The evolved photocurrent
is a direct measure of the rate of generation
of free radicals. The hydroxyl radical, HO·, is the
most reactive among all free radicals, and its spatial distribution
and effects on charge-transfer reactions were evaluated using SECM.
The redox mediators used include FcMeOH and Ru(NH3)6Cl3 that can undergo oxidation and reduction reactions
at the Pt UME with applied potential: 2   3  Since these reactions
are
one-step redox reactions, the redox current that was measured directly
reveals the influence and extent of generation of HO· radicals. First, the surface reactivity of the 48 h aged coating,
without illumination, was assessed by the SECM approach curves. Herein,
the Pt UME was potentiostatically held at +0.4 and −0.4 VAg/AgCl in DPBS solutions containing 2 mM FcMeOH and Ru(NH3)6Cl3, respectively, so that diffusion-limiting
currents are achieved. The evolution of diffusion-limiting currents
was measured, while the Pt UME progressively approached the 48 h aged
coating at a rate of 1 μm/s (see Figure 8a). The dashed line shows the calculated
response,27 representing the theoretical
approach curve of an insulating substrate. A good match between the
measured curves and the calculated curve indicates that, when not
excited by light, the coating inhibits both oxidative and reductive
charge-transfer reactions. In other words, the coating is expected
to provide excellent corrosion resistance to the implant ensuring
enhanced chemical durability.

Figure 8 (a) Approach curves obtained in DPBS + 2 mM
FcMeOH (denoted as
Fc) and DPBS + 2 mM Ru(NH3)6Cl3 (denoted
as Ru) solutions under nonilluminated conditions. The current and
distance from the substrate are normalized by the limiting currents
and the tip radius. The dashed line represents the theoretical approach
curve for an insulating surface. (b) Cyclic voltammetry curves conducted
with the Pt UME at 3 and 30 μm away from the coating surface.
“on” and “off” represent conditions with
and without illumination, respectively. (c) A schematic illustrating
the mechanism of positive and negative feedbacks.

The diffusion-limiting current measured at Pt UME is subject to
feedback effects from the substrate if HO· radicals
are generated by the coating up on its illumination. Based on the
current–distance relationship established by the approach curves,
the Pt UME was positioned 3 and 30 μm above the coating surface,
and cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to probe feedback effects. As
shown in Figure 8b,
when the Pt UME is placed 3 μm above the coating in the Ru-DPBS
solution, the limiting current of the reduction reaction, that is,
the plateau current associated with reducing Ru(NH3)63+ to Ru(NH3)62+, increases under UV–vis illumination. This indicates that
the coating’s surface enhances the oxidation reaction so that
more oxidized Ru(NH3)63+ can flow
to the tip where it is subsequently reduced. However, the limiting
current decreases for the tip-oxidation reaction (Fc to Fc+) under the same conditions, indicating that surface reduction is
inhibited and the Fc concentration at the tip is reduced. As such,
the coating exhibits positive feedback following the UME’s
reduction but offers negative feedback for UME-oxidation reactions.
On the other hand, feedback effects are both negligible when the Pt
UME is positioned 30 μm above the coating, that is, when no
reaction effects associated with the substrate are detected by the
UME.

To better illustrate the feedback effect, Figure 8c shows UME-substrate interactions.
When
excited by light, free hydroxyl radicals (HO·) are
produced and are adsorbed at the coating surface.28 When reducing Ru(NH3)63+ to Ru(NH3)62+ at the Pt UME, the
produced Ru(NH3)62+ diffuses toward
the substrate and reacts with the HO· radicals to
form Ru(NH3)63+, which diffuses back
toward the UME. Therefore, a UME-reduction, substrate-oxidation loop
is set up, and the substrate elevates the concentration of Ru(NH3)63+ that promotes tip-reduction, that
is, providing positive feedback. In the case of UME-oxidation of Fc
to Fc+, Fc is not only oxidized at the Pt UME due to the
applied potential but also at the substrate due to photoinduced HO· radicals such that the substrate competes with the UME
resulting in negative feedback. In any event, the changes observed
in limiting currents (Figure 8b) signify that, upon illumination, the coating can enhance
oxidation and inhibit reduction reactions by nearly 20% within a near-field
region (i.e., on the order of around 3 μm from the substrate)
in solution. This is attributed to the high activity of free radicals
(e.g., HO·) affecting redox rates of the mediators
in this region. As the distance from the coating surface increases,
the concentration of free radicals reduces significantly as these
species are consumed or decomposed. As a result, the CV curves acquired
at 30 μm show limiting currents for both redox reactions that
are no longer affected by illumination, indicative of a negligible
free radical activity. Taken together, these results suggest that
coating materials of the nature developed herein are well-suited for
localized free radical release in close vicinity to implant and tissue
surfaces.

Summary and Conclusions
A defected
titania composition was synthesized for potential applications
such as coating of implant (titanium alloy) surfaces. The coatability
of the sol–gel precursor was found to increase with increasing
aging on account of the development of electrostatic repulsion among
colloidal charged particulates in solution. As a result, coatings
aged for 48 h exhibited complete surface coverage and uniformity and
hence superior coatability. Careful analysis using Raman spectroscopy
identified that the coating is composed of intermixed anatase/rutile
components that are clearly distinguished from the typical thermal
oxides that form following heat treatment in air. Indeed, XPS indicates
that the coating is not only doped with nitrogen but also self-defected
and therefore features substoichiometric Ti2+ and Ti3+ species. These defects promote visible light absorption
of the coating by alteration of the band structure. Upon illumination,
SECM detects the formation and release of oxidative hydroxyl radicals
within a proximate region on the order of several micrometers. Therefore
and significantly, this coating may be appropriate to address clinical
issues such as the onset of localized peri-implant infections due
to the formation of bactericidal hydroxyl radicals while minimizing
the exposure impacts on adjacent body tissues. Expectedly, an important
follow-up step in the development of such materials requires explicit
analysis of their antimicrobial activity, as well as cytological compatibility,
to ensure that they are suitable for use with practical hard tissue
implants.

Materials and Methods
Sample Preparation
The external
implant surface was
modified by applying a coating precursor. Briefly, a sol–gel
Solution A was prepared by mixing 500 μL of titanium(IV) isopropoxide
(Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4), 6 mL of ethanol,
70 μL of 70% HNO3, and 10 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate
(CH3(CH2)11SO4Na) using
vortex mixing until a clear solution was obtained. Next, nitrogen
doping was effected by preparation of sol–gel Solution B, which
involved mixing 4.4 mL of DI water, 1.2 mL of 100% ethanol, and 183
μL of a 15% ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) solution. The precursor was then composed by titrating Solution
B into Solution A dropwise while stirring. Thereafter, the precursor
was aged at room temperature while stirring. During aging, the rheology
of the precursor was characterized (TA Discovery) using a vane-cup
assembly at a constant rotation speed of 100 rad/s. The measured torque
was used to quantify the solution’s viscosity. In addition,
the ζ potential of the precursor (Malvern Zetasizer), during
aging, was measured using samples diluted with DI water (volume ratio
1:200).

Since trace dosages of Pd in TiO2 can enhance
photocatalytic activity,29,30 Grade 7 Ti discs (Ti-0.2%Pd,
7 mm: diameter, 1.5 mm: thickness) were selected as the substrate.
The discs were progressively polished to a 0.05 μm surface finish
using colloidal silica and sequentially sonicated in acetone and DI
water for 10 min each. Thereafter, the discs were dip-coated with
the precursor and aged for 15 min, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. The
dipping operation was controlled by a robotic dispenser that permits
a constant withdrawal rate of 0.3 mm/s. The coated discs were dried
in a fume hood for 10 min and then cured in an oven at 150 °C
for 30 min. These dip-coating and heating processes were successively
repeated four times. The coated samples were subsequently heated in
air (heating rate: 1 °C/min) to 450 °C. The samples were
held at this temperature for 2 h to remove residual solvents and to
facilitate phase conversion(s). An uncoated “control”
substrate underwent identical heat treatments to enable the formation
of an oxidation layer on its exposed surfaces. Along with the coated
substrates, the 48 h aged sol–gel precursor was heated in a
glass Petri dish using the same procedure to produce the nitrogen-doped
TiO2 powder (48 h NTO powder). A standard P25 TiO2 powder (Sigma Aldrich Aeroxide) representing the undoped TiO2 was used as a comparison to the doped NTO powder.

Phase
Composition Characterization
Microstructural
and phase analyses of the NTO powders and the coatings were carried
out using X-ray diffraction (XRD: Panalytical X’Pert Pro) and
Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia, using a 633 nm laser source).
The morphology and composition of the processed surfaces were characterized
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NOVA 230) coupled with
an energy dispersive X-ray emission spectrometer (EDS, Thermo Scientific
UltraDry). Finally, both elemental compositions and valence states
were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Ultra
DLD) using monochromated Al Kα radiation (15 kV, 10 mA), with
a pass energy of 20 eV for high-resolution surveys. It should be noted
that, prior to the XPS analysis, the sample surfaces were cleaned
by Ar+ sputtering for 3 min to remove any surface impurities.
Following XPS analysis, quantitative analysis of the spectra was carried
out using the CasaXPS software.31

Photocatalysis
Characterization
UV–vis absorbances
of the 48 h NTO and the P25 powders were determined using diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (SHIMADZU UV-3101PC). To characterize the
photocatalytic properties of the coated surfaces, photocurrent measurements
were conducted using a potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research: VersaSTAT
4) that employs a Pt counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, pH 7.4) was used
as an electrolyte with an ion concentration and isotonic osmolarity
analogous to human blood. During the electrochemical analysis, illumination
was provided using a xenon lamp (Rofin PL 500) with tunable output
wavelengths spanning from 350 to 650 nm. A constant illumination intensity
of 20 mW/cm2 over 50 s cycles of illumination was applied
for both ultraviolet and visible wavelengths of light. The effects
of photocatalytic redox reactions occurring at the coating/solution
interface were evaluated using scanning electrochemical microscopy
(SECM: HEKA ElProScan) operated in feedback mode. A 3.3 mW/cm2 white light was used as the light source in SECM measurements.
The SECM is equipped with a 10 μm radius Pt ultra-microelectrode
(UME) with an RG ratio, that is, the ratio of the glass sheath radius
to the Pt UME radius, of 2.4. The DPBS solution is used as the background
electrolyte with 2 mM ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH, C11H12FeO) and hexaammineruthenium chloride (Ru(NH3)6Cl3) as the oxidative and reductive redox mediators,
respectively.
