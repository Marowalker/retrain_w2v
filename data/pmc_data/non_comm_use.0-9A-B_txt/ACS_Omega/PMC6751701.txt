Titanium dioxide
nanoparticles were fixed on a glass fiber cloth
using zeolite synthesis. This led to the formation of a photocatalytic
zeolite cloth (PZC). Cloth samples were characterized by various diffraction
and scanning electron microscopic techniques. The evoked results showed
that zeolite X was synthesized on the PZC, while titanium dioxide
was included within the PZC. Additional PZC analyses indicated that
the fiber cross-section had three-layered structures. The outer layer
(third layer) contained zeolite X. It was found that most of the titanium
dioxide nanoparticles were present between the second (amorphous)
and third layers (zeolite) but only a few existed in the zeolite layer.
The photocatalytic activity of PZC was evaluated based on the degradation
of methylene blue in the presence of ultraviolet irradiation. Findings
showed that PZC exhibited increased adsorption and degradation activities
compared to the glass fiber cloth on which only titanium dioxide nanoparticles
were coated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Titanium dioxide has been
extensively studied as a photocatalytic
material.1−11 Most of the commercially available titanium dioxide has been circulated
in powdery or sol states as a powder–solution mixture. When
a new product with titanium dioxide will be developed, it is desirable
to utilize its commercial powder state form because the quality is
guaranteed by the manufacturer. However, because it is considerably
difficult to collect titanium dioxide powder from a water solvent
after a reaction in the case at which powdery titanium dioxide has
been applied to the water system—such as in the case of the
purification of the sewage—it is expected that titanium dioxide
will be processed in fibrous and sheet states. It is desirable for
titanium dioxide to be directly fixed on inorganic materials, such
as glass fibers that are resilient to oxidation and are chemically
stable. However, it is difficult for this material to adhere to regions
between inorganic materials without a binder. Recently, binderless
fixation of titanium dioxide on glass fibers has been reported.12,13 In these studies, titanium dioxide particles were synthesized directly
on glass fibers based on the crystallization reaction, but the processing
methods were complex, and the control of the quality of the material,
such as its degree of crystallinity and photocatalytic ability, was
difficult. Therefore, it is desirable to fix commercially available
titanium dioxide powder directly on glass fibers using a simple method.
An example where titanium dioxide powder was fixed on glass fibers14 is the case in which the electrostatic force
between the epoxy and hydroxyl groups of titanium dioxide was used
to facilitate the fixation of titanium dioxide powder on a glass fiber,
which was coated with epoxy resin. However, resin is an organic material
but it is considered to be weak against oxidation.

The composition
of titanium dioxide with zeolite endows it with
an adsorptive capacity that leads to the enhancement of its photocatalytic
activity.15−17 These studies adopted a method that did not use powdery
titanium dioxide but synthesized titanium dioxide on an adsorbent
material based on a calcination process after the loading of a titanium
dioxide precursor on the adsorbent. However, removing the zeolite–titanium
dioxide particles from the solution can also be very difficult.

Thus, the glass fiber that possesses adsorption and decomposition
properties will be extensively applied given that both the titanium
dioxide powder and the adsorbent could be fixed on this fiber with
the use of a simple technique. Ozkan et al.18 has reported that both the adsorbent and titanium dioxide have been
loaded on glass fibers. This technique involved the use of a complicated,
two-phase synthetic procedure to crystallize titanium dioxide on silicate-1
using a sol–gel method after the synthesis of silicate-1 on
the glass fiber surface. However, powdered titanium dioxide has not
been previously used by this technique.

We have succeeded in
synthesizing titanium dioxide and zeolite
particles by the addition of titanium dioxide to a zeolite precursor,
and we have reported that the composite particle has higher photocatalytic
activity than titanium dioxide.19 Furthermore,
we have demonstrated that the composite particles of titanium dioxide
and zeolite have high-absorption efficiencies in comparison with the
physical mixture of titanium dioxide and zeolite particles.20 This technique not only enables the enhancement
of the photocatalytic activity, but also enables the fixation of titanium
dioxide particles into zeolite particles. In other words, a zeolite
particle will allow adherence of titanium dioxide based on the synthetic
process of zeolite if titanium dioxide powder exists within or on
the zeolite precursor. In effect, zeolite could act as a binder between
the titanium dioxide and a support surface, such as glass fiber. To
the best of our knowledge, to date, no methods have been reported
that allow the fixation of titanium dioxide particles on glass fibers
with the use of zeolite particles as binder components.

The
objective of this study was the simplification of the process
(single-step) based on which titanium dioxide could be loaded on a
glass fiber cloth (T-GFC). Based on this notion, it is expected that
titanium dioxide particles are allowed to be loaded on the glass fiber
surface based on the conversion of part of the glass fiber surface
to zeolite when titanium dioxide is coated on the glass fiber. In
this study, we prepared a photocatalytic zeolite cloth (PZC) with
titanium dioxide with adsorption and degradation properties at low
temperatures.

2 Results and Discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) outcomes for all of the studied samples
are shown in Figure 1. The raw material of the glass fiber cloth (Figure 1a) was an amorphous substance because a broad
XRD peak was observed instead of a clear peak. Because the T-GFC sample
(Figure 1b) was only
coated by titanium dioxide particles, the observed XRD peaks indicated
the presence of anatase-type titanium dioxide. The synthesized PZC
contained anatase-type titanium dioxide and zeolite X, as justified
by the XRD peaks (Figure 1c).

indicate the presence of zeolite X, and white circles indicate the
presence of anatase titanium dioxide. (a) A glass fiber cloth (GFC)

Figure 2a,b shows
the field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of
the glass fiber cloth and T-GFC. In addition, Figure 2c–e shows the FESEM images of the
glass fiber after the reaction (PZC). The glass fiber cloth had a
smooth surface which was characteristic of the amorphous substance.
However, the FESEM image of T-GFC shows that the surface of the glass
fiber was covered with an aggregated titanium dioxide that contained
a lump. Accordingly, it was difficult to confirm the existence of
the glass fiber itself.

(FESEM) images of tested
samples. (a) GFC, (b) GFC coated with titanium dioxide (T-GFC), and
(c–e) PZC.

Conversely, the presence
of aggregated titanium dioxide particles
was confirmed in T-GFC. These particles disappeared in the FESEM image
of the PZC. Angular particles appeared and uniformly covered the surface
of the glass fiber (Figure 2c,d). The newly produced angular particles contained zeolite
X, as confirmed by XRD analyses (Figure 1c). The XRD analyses showed that anatase-type
titanium dioxide was included in the PZC sample, but the presence
of aggregated titanium dioxide observed in the FESEM image of T-GFC
was not confirmed. Figure 2e shows the magnified FESEM image of the zeolite particle
observed in PZC. Fine particles with diameters of the order of 20
nm were observed in a buried state in the zeolite particles and in
a highly dispersive state on their surfaces. Because the scanning
electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)
analysis (Figure 3)
confirmed the presence of titanium (Ti) on the PZC surface, it was
thought that these fine particles were titanium dioxide particles.
The aforementioned results suggest that titanium dioxide particles
were fixed on the glass fiber based on the synthesis of zeolite in
mild conditions. The supernatant liquid drained during the PZC synthesis
was quite transparent, which means that zeolite was synthesized only
on the glass fiber cloth and that the titanium dioxide coated on the
glass fiber cloth did not flow into the solution. No precipitation
in the reactant solution would be expected (Scheme 1).

a function of the X-ray energy in absorption spectra.

Additionally, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-EDX
analysis of PZC was carried out to clarify whether all of the aggregated
titanium dioxide particles that covered the glass fiber cloth (observed
with SEM imaging of T-GFC) were immobilized in the zeolite particles. The high-angle annular dark-field
(HAADF)-STEM image is shown in Figure 4a. The cross-section of the provided PZC has three
layer structures with the following characteristics: the first (φ:
2.5 μm), second (thickness: 1 μm), and third (thickness:
1.2 μm) layer. As indicated in the first layer, a dense structure
was observed. Conversely, the second layer had a void and a porous
shape. Furthermore, the third layer also has a dense structure, while
the outermost surface (third layer) exists in a folded form. The EDX
analysis of the HAADF-STEM image (Figure 4) is shown in Figure 5. In the first and second layers, O, Mg,
Al, and Si were detected, which are the main components of the glass
fiber cloth (raw material). Both layers contained amorphous substances
when the XRD results (Figure 1) were considered. Regarding the third layer, Na was also
detected in addition to O, Al, and Si, but Mg was absent. Therefore,
we conclude that the third layer was zeolite X. Based on EDX analyses,
it is revealed that most of the Ti was detected between the second
and the third layers (Figure 5a). The magnified image of the HAADF-STEM is shown in Figure 4b. Ti was also detected
in the outer surface of the third layer (zeolite layer) in Figure 5b. Based on these
results, it is confirmed that the added titanium dioxide particles
were part of the zeolite layer, even though most of them were incorporated
in regions around the center of the fiber. Additionally, the possible
mechanism of the loading of titanium dioxide particles on the glass
fiber is shown in Scheme 2. Titanium dioxide particles coated on the glass fiber moved
from the surface of the fiber to a dissolved part of the glass fiber
based on NaOH processing. At this time, the second layer could not
be dissolved and remained in the solid state based on its reaction
with NaOH. Zeolite crystallization began at the glass fiber surface,
but most of the titanium dioxide particles moved through a leaching
part toward the center of the fiber, while zeolite was crystallized
during its uptake by the titanium dioxide particles.

Scheme 2 Schematic Illustrating
the Possible Mechanism of PZC Synthesis
The results of the methylene blue degradation test in T-GFC and
PZC are shown in Figure 6. Because the titanium dioxide particle was only coated on the glass
fiber surface, the adsorption of methylene blue on T-GFC was minimal.
Conversely, immediately after the onset of the examination, it was
shown that PZC included zeolite and adsorbed methylene blue. The adsorption
of methylene blue reached 70% of its initial concentration at 100
min after the examination onset. Methylene blue molecules were assumed
to be adsorbed only on the surface of zeolite.21,22 At that time, the samples were irradiated with UV. Even though titanium
dioxide was included in T-GFC, the decrease in the concentration of
methylene blue was slow. Poor adsorption of methylene blue on T-GFC
means that the contact probability between titanium dioxide and methylene
blue was low, which led to the low photocatalytic activity of methylene
blue. By contrast, the concentration of methylene blue rapidly decreased
following UV irradiation in the experiment with PZC. The titanium
dioxide particles were closely attached to zeolite particles in PZC,
which means that the contact probability of titanium dioxide and this
close attachment allowed the transfer of methylene blue from zeolite
to titanium dioxide, and the photocatalytic degradation activity of
PZC was higher than that of T-GFC. Figure 7 shows the UV–vis spectra of T-GFC
(a) and PZC (b). The absorbance values of T-GFC and PZC at 365 nm
were approximately equal. The relative photocatalytic efficiency of
PZC is higher than that of T-GFC owing to adsorption methylene blue
on PZC. This is why the photocatalytic activity of PZC is higher than
that of T-GFC.18

test outcomes in T-GFC (blue circle)
and PZC (red circle).

Figure 7 Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) of (a) T-GFC (blue line)
and (b) PZC (red line).

Herein, the rate of decrease
in the concentration of methylene
blue during UV irradiation (R: ppm/min) was calculated
from the slope of the graph plotted in Figure 7. RT-GFC (for T-GFC) and RPZC (for PZC) were
0.88 × 10–2 and 1.7 × 10–2 ppm/min, respectively, and RPZC was
1.9 times higher than RT-GFC.

Based on the cross-sectional observations, the PZC outcomes revealed
that most of the titanium dioxide was present between the second and
the third layers of the glass fiber. It is assumed that titanium dioxide
which existed in the central part did not contribute to the degradation
of methylene blue because the methylene blue molecules remained at
the zeolite surface. Accordingly, it was assumed that titanium dioxide
existed at the surface of the glass fiber, that is, the titanium dioxide
at the surface of zeolite was responsible for the degradation of methylene
blue. The EDX analysis of the cross-section of the fiber in PZC demonstrated
that the amount of titanium dioxide at the third layer of the fiber
was minimal. It is interesting that the photocatalytic activity of
such a minute quantity of titanium dioxide was higher compared to
that of T-GFC in which the titanium dioxide was bared on the surface
of the glass fiber. This may explain the increased efficiency of light
absorption, as reported in a previous study.19 Irrespective of these facts, a technique was proposed herein based
on which the utilization of titanium dioxide can be maximized in photocatalytic
reactions. The search for the optimum amount of titanium dioxide will
be the focus of future studies.

3 Conclusions
In summary, titanium dioxide particles were fixed on a glass fiber
cloth based on zeolite synthesis because zeolite acted as a binder
between titanium dioxide and the support glass fiber cloth. Part of
the glass fiber surface was converted to zeolite, and titanium dioxide
particles were incorporated into the zeolite particle surface despite
the fact that most of them existed between the second and the third
layers. In the degradation examination of methylene blue, the photocatalytic
activity of the glass fiber on which zeolite was synthesized was 1.9
times higher than that of the glass fiber on which titanium dioxide
was coated. A possible fixation mechanism has been proposed. In this
study, the experiments were conducted in a water system. Nevertheless,
it is assumed that similar processes can become available in vapor
phase systems. Furthermore, this method may be expected to be utilized
as a new technique for the fixation of inorganic nanoparticles on
glass fibers. We believe that this study provides new insights into
the fixation of titanium dioxide particles on glass fibers and on
glass fiber cloths with adsorptive and photocatalytic properties.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
A glass
fiber cloth (GFC)
(Nitto Boseki Co., Ltd.) was used as the support surface. The chemical
composition of GFC included SiO2 (64–66 mass %),
Al2O3 (24–26 mass %), and MgO (9–11
mass %). The photocatalytic material used was commercial sol-formed
titanium dioxide (TS-S4110, Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.; specific
surface area: 117 m2/g). Sodium hydroxide was purchased
from Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd.

4.2 Preparation
of Samples
A GFC (1.0
g) was cut into squares (length size = 20 mm). When titanium dioxide
(20% by weight) was dropped on the cut GFC pieces, GFC pieces coated
with titanium dioxide were obtained. These were dried at 378 K in
an oven for 2 h (in the remaining parts of this document, these samples
will be referred to as T-GFC). Titanium dioxide (16% by weight) was
included in T-GFC. The T-GFC sample was placed on the bottom of a
container that was made of Teflon, and 30 mL of a 3 M sodium hydroxide
solution was added to it. The GFC contains SiO2 and Al2O3, which dissolve and convert to zeolite by NaOH
treatment. The container was then sealed and was left in the oven
at 333 K for 24 h. The solution after the reaction was transparent
and did not exhibit changes compared to the solution before the reaction.
Each resulting sample was carefully removed from the container with
tweezers. It was transferred to a beaker to which 300 mL of distilled
water was added and was maintained for 24 h to remove alkali from
the samples. The sample was transferred to a conical flask containing
300 mL of distilled water and was thoroughly washed while it was shaken
with a shaker for 24 h. The reactant was dried at 378 K in the oven
which led to the formation of PZC. A schematic illustration of the
process is shown in Scheme 1.

4.3 Characterization of Samples
For the
identification of the prepared samples, X-ray diffraction analysis
(Rigaku Ultima IV) was performed. Cu Kα was used as an X-ray
source, and the analysis was carried out in the range of 2θ
= 3–60°. For morphological observations of the prepared
samples, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Jeol
JSM-6335F) was carried out. Pt was deposited on the samples prior
to the FESEM observations. In addition, for the elemental analysis
of the samples, SEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS)
analysis (JEOL JSM-IT100) was also conducted. Furthermore, observations
and elemental analyses for the fiber cross-section were performed
on a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) system (JEOL ARM200F) with the use of an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV at tilt angles in the range of 68–280 mrad
and on a scanning transmission electron microscope-energy-dispersion
X-ray analysis (STEM-EDX) system (JEOL JED-2300T) after the cross-sectioning
of the fiber was carried out with a focused ion beam (FIB) instrument.
In addition, in the case of FIB processing, carbon (C) was deposited
on the surface of the sample for surface protection. Diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS) was performed with the use of an integrated sphere
(V-670, JASCO, Co.).

4.4 Photocatalytic Experiment
To evaluate
the photocatalytic activity of samples, a methylene blue degradation
test was conducted. A volume of 5 mL of methylene blue water solution
(25 ppm) was poured into a glass laboratory dish (φ 42 mm),
and one 20 mm2 sample was placed at the bottom of this
dish. The glass laboratory dish was covered by a glass lid. An ultraviolet
(UV) lamp was installed at a height of 4 cm from the bottom of the
glass laboratory dish. The glass laboratory dish was placed on a shaker,
and the test was performed. After 120 min from the onset of the examination,
UV (UVGL-25) with a central wavelength of 365 nm was irradiated on
the sample. The glass laboratory dish was cooled by air with a cooling
fan to prevent the sample from being heated owing to the heat generated
by the UV lamp. The concentration of methylene blue was determined
based on the intensity of the absorption peak at the wavelength of
613 nm on a spectrophotometer (JASCO V-530).
