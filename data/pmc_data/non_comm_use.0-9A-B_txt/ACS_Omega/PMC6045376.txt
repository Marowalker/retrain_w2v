Kinase
inhibitors are among the most intensely investigated compounds
in medicinal chemistry and drug development. Profiling experiments
and kinome screens reveal binding characteristics of kinase inhibitors
and lead to better understanding of selectivity and promiscuity patterns.
However, only limited amounts of profiling data are publicly available.
By contrast, a large body of activity data for inhibitors of human
kinases has become available from medicinal chemistry. In this study,
we have correlated selectivity assessment of clinical kinase inhibitors
from the most comprehensive profiling campaign reported to date with
systematic mining of activity data from other sources. The results
of our comparative analysis reveal consistency of orthogonal approaches
in the study of kinase inhibitor selectivity versus promiscuity and
stress the importance of taking alternative data confidence criteria
into account. Moreover, it is also shown that there are little if
any detectable differences in selectivity between type I and II kinase
inhibitors and that inhibitors designated as chemical probes have
very different target profiles.

1 Introduction
Kinase inhibitors are
prime candidates for drug development in
different therapeutic areas such as oncology, inflammatory diseases,
and so forth.1−4 To better understand their binding characteristics and target profiles,
kinase inhibitors have been—and continue to be—subjected
to profiling experiments including various panel assays and kinome
screens.5−12 Because the majority of current kinase inhibitors bind to the conserved
adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) site in kinases, or regions
proximal to this site,12−14 selectivity versus promiscuity of kinase inhibitors
is still an intensely debated issue,2−4,12−16 with important implications for therapeutic applications and clinical
performance.2,3,17

Recently, Klaeger et al. have reported the most comprehensive kinase
inhibitor profiling study available to date,18 yielding a variety of binding, functional, and structural data for
a set of 243 kinase inhibitors at different stages of clinical evaluation
and development, including marketed drugs. The authors primarily applied
a chemoproteomics approach. “Kinobeads”, that is, nonspecific
kinase inhibitors immobilized on the solid phase, were used to extract
bound target proteins from mixed lysates of different cancer cell
lines. Target binding was then determined using quantitative mass
spectrometry. Using loaded kinobeads from lysates, dose-dependent
competition assays with clinical kinase inhibitors were carried out
to identify their targets and determine apparent dissociation constants.18 The set of clinical kinase inhibitors was found
to interact with a total of 253 kinases, comprising nearly half of
the human kinome. A key finding of this study has been that the investigated
clinical kinase inhibitors covered a wide spectrum of binding characteristics
ranging from selective to highly promiscuous compounds.18

Given this extensive in vivo-oriented
target identification effort
for clinical kinase inhibitors and the variety of target profiles
that were observed, we were interested in evaluating how some of the
findings of Klaeger et al. might relate to the promiscuity assessment
of kinase inhibitors on the basis of currently available activity
data. We reasoned that comparison with literature data from medicinal
chemistry might often provide complementary or orthogonal views of
inhibitor selectivity versus promiscuity, given the many different
assays these compounds were tested in. Klaeger et al. also searched
the kinase inhibitor literature and retrieved biological activity
annotations from ChEMBL,19 the major public
repository of compounds and activity data from medicinal chemistry
sources. They noted that no bioactivity records were deposited for
35 of the clinical kinase inhibitors under investigation.18

We have systematically collected all activity
data available in
ChEMBL for the clinical kinase inhibitors studied by Klaeger et al.
and organized these data according to different confidence criteria.
Then target annotations were identified and promiscuity degrees (PDs)
of inhibitors were calculated at different data confidence levels.
We also identified kinase inhibitors that were most and least selective
on the basis of the data of Klaeger et al. and separately determined
the target profiles for these inhibitors. The comparison of our findings
with results of Klaeger et al. is reported herein.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Clinical Kinase Inhibitors
and Data Confidence
Level Criteria
ChEMBL identifiers and SMILES representations
of clinical kinase inhibitors were taken from the supplementary information
of Klaeger et al.18 and mapped to ChEMBL
(release 23, accessed in Jan 2018).19 Only
human targets were considered to conform with Klaeger et al. For inhibitors
annotated with human targets, activity data were collected at two
different confidence levels including levels 1 (intermediate) and
2 (high). For confidence level 1, the highest assay confidence was
required for ChEMBL data, and for level 2, the highest assay and,
in addition, highest measurement confidence were required for ChEMBL
data. Accordingly, activity data were only selected from direct inhibition
assays (assay relationship type “D”) for single targets
with the highest assay confidence score (“9”). In addition,
only unambiguously specified Ki or IC50 measurements with standard activity unit (“nM”)
and consistent “activity comments” were considered.
To address the compound concentration dependence of target annotations
and identify weak inhibitory interactions, we also generated results
for comparison after applying a <10 μM activity (potency)
threshold to both data confidence levels.

2.2 Selectivity
Scores and Promiscuity Degrees
Klaeger et al. introduced
the “Concentration- And Target-Dependent
Selectivity” (CATDS) score for the analysis of their experiments.18 The CATDS score quantifies the reduction
in binding of a given target to kinobeads at a particular inhibitor
concentration relative to the summed reduction in binding of all available
targets. As defined, CATDS scores of inhibitors are target-dependent.
Scores approaching 1 are characteristic of a selective kinase inhibitor (i.e., the compound almost exclusively inhibits
a single target), whereas scores close to 0 are usually indicative
of a nonselective (highly promiscuous) inhibitor.
For each clinical kinase inhibitor found in ChEMBL, we selected the
largest available CATDS score as a selectivity measure. Furthermore,
we calculated the “promiscuity degree” (PD) of an inhibitor
as the number of its unique targets on the basis of the activity records
from ChEMBL that qualified for confidence levels 1 or 2 in the presence
or absence of the <10 μM activity threshold.

2.3 Kinase Inhibitor Types and Chemical Probes
A subset
of clinical kinase inhibitors was assigned by Klaeger
et al. to type I or type II inhibitor category on the basis of the
available structural data and binding mode information.18 Type I kinase inhibitors bind to the conserved
ATP site in the active form of the kinase, whereas type II inhibitors
bind to the inactive form and less conserved regions adjacent to the
ATP site.13,14 Therefore, type II inhibitors are often
expected to be more selective than type I inhibitors. We separately
analyzed PDs for inhibitors with type I or II binding mode.

Furthermore, a subset of clinical kinase inhibitors were designated
chemical probes18 on the basis of reports
from the Chemical Probes Portal.20 For
such probe compounds used in chemical biology, a high degree of selectivity
is generally required. Therefore, we also separately analyzed PD values
of the designated chemical probes among clinical kinase inhibitors.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Clinical
Kinase Inhibitors and Data Confidence
Levels
Structures of 3 of the 243 clinical kinase inhibitors
were not found in ChEMBL. In addition, 38 inhibitors were not annotated
with human targets, leaving 202 inhibitors with at least one known
human target for activity data confidence analysis. For confidence
level 1, the highest assay confidence was required, and for the more
stringent level 2, the highest assay plus highest measurement confidence
were required. These data confidence levels were established to exclude
target annotations from the analysis that were only weakly supported
experimentally (e.g., target annotations from cell-based assays lacking
confirmation of direct target engagement).

Confidence level
1 was met by activity data of 185 of 202 clinical kinase inhibitors
available in ChEMBL. These 185 inhibitors were active against a total
of 394 human kinases and 218 nonkinase targets. After applying the
<10 μM activity threshold, 172 inhibitors were available
for confidence level 1 that were active against 379 kinases and 64
nonkinase targets. Furthermore, 166 of the 185 inhibitors qualified
for confidence level 2, which were active against 122 human kinases
and 66 nonkinase targets. After applying the <10 μM activity
threshold to confidence level 2, 164 inhibitors were obtained with
activity against 122 kinases and 52 nonkinase targets. Hence, there
was a sharp decline in target numbers at increasing data confidence.
For comparison, at confidence level 1, clinical inhibitors were active
against a total of 394 human kinases on the basis of the currently
available data (379 human kinases after applying the activity threshold),
while Klaeger et al. identified 253 kinase targets. The human kinome
comprises 518 kinases.21

Although
a significant number of nonkinase targets were identified,
the majority of the clinical kinase inhibitors were predominantly
active against kinases. After applying the <10 μM activity
threshold to both data confidence levels, the number of nonkinase
target annotations notably reduced by 154 targets for confidence level
1 and by 14 targets for confidence level 2, much more so than the
number of human kinase annotations (with 15 kinases for confidence
level 1 and 0 for confidence level 2). For statistical considerations,
we also calculated fractional kinase PD values, defined as (#kinase
targets/#targets). On average, these values were very close to 1.
Therefore, for the purpose of our statistical analysis, it was not
required to further distinguish between kinase and nonkinase targets.

3.2 Global Promiscuity Degrees
Figure 1 shows the distribution
of PD values for the inhibitor subsets at confidence levels 1 and
2. At level 1, a broad distribution was observed with inhibitors in
the upper quartile having hundreds of target annotations. However,
although supported by in vitro assay confidence, many of these PDs
were most likely artificially high because it is hardly conceivable
that a clinical compound might indeed act in vivo on hundreds of targets.
Of course, at high—or artificially high—compound concentrations,
more activities might be detected. When the activity threshold was
applied to level 1, the distribution became much more narrow, and
the median PD was reduced from 7 to 4, whereas the distribution for
level 2 remained nearly unchanged. In this context, it should be noted
that Klaeger et al. detected 494 transcribed kinases including mutant
forms in their experiments and 363 translated kinases, 253 of which
were bound to kinobeads.18

Figure 1 PDs on the basis of known
activities. Box plots report the distribution
of the PD of clinical kinase inhibitors on the basis of activity data
from ChEMBL at different confidence levels (top: level 2, 166 inhibitors;
level 1, 185) and after applying the <10 μM activity threshold
(bottom: level 2, 164; level 1, 172). Box plots contain the smallest
value (bottom line), first quartile (lower boundary of the box), median
value (thick line), third quartile (upper boundary), largest value
(top line), and outliers (points below the bottom or above the top
line).

Hence, on the basis of medicinal
chemistry data, the 185 inhibitors
qualifying for confidence level 1 (172 after applying the activity
threshold) were annotated with a larger fraction of the human kinome
(394 kinases, 379 after applying the threshold) than that was accessible
to the 243 inhibitors during proteomics profiling.

However, Figure 1 also shows that
many inhibitors at confidence level 1 had only low
PD values, especially after applying the activity threshold. Taken
together, these findings were consistent with the identification of
selective to highly promiscuous inhibitors by Klaeger et al.

At confidence level 2, the distribution of the PD values was narrow,
with a median of 3, and an upper quartile range of 3–5, with
only a limited number of statistical outliers having PD values larger
than 10 (there were only little differences when applying the activity
threshold). Thus, the comparison in Figure 1 revealed a strong influence of data confidence
criteria on the global distribution of PDs. Hence, analyzing activity
data and target annotations at different confidence levels yielded
a differentiated view of the target space of kinase inhibitors charted
under varying experimental stringency. It also provides a meaningful
framework for evaluating the results of profiling experiments.

3.3 Most and Least Selective Kinase Inhibitors
Next, we
analyzed the distribution of CATDS scores reported by
Klaeger et al. to determine subsets of the most and least selective
inhibitors according to this scoring scheme. Therefore, a score histogram
was generated, and the resulting distribution was fitted to a normal
distribution, yielding a mean value m and standard
deviation σ of 0.510 and 0.285, respectively. Then subsets of
the most and least selective inhibitors were defined by applying score
thresholds of 1 σ above and below the mean, respectively. The
resulting most selective (CATDS ≥ m + σ;
CATDS ≥ 0.795) and least selective (CATDS ≤ m − σ; CATDS ≤ 0.225) subsets contained
39 and 36 inhibitors, respectively.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of PD values for
these subsets at confidence levels 1 and 2. At confidence level 1,
broad distributions were observed for both subsets, similar to that
of Figure 1, with median
PD values of 6.5 and 8 for the most and least selective inhibitors,
respectively. Thus, differences in selectivity between these subsets
were only small. The distributions became very narrow after applying
the activity threshold, and the median PD values were reduced. However,
the distribution for the most selective inhibitors contained compounds
with hundreds of target annotations, more so than the distribution
for least selective inhibitors, indicating that this data confidence
level was inappropriate to reconcile differences in selectivity suggested
by CATDS scoring. A different picture emerged for distributions generated
at confidence level 2. In this case, the distributions were narrow,
in the presence or absence of the activity threshold, similar to that
of Figure 1, yielding
mean PD values of 2 and 4 (or 3) for the most and least selective
inhibitors, respectively. Thus, at high activity data confidence,
differences in selectivity between these subsets were also small,
taking into account that the most selective inhibitor subset was defined
by a CATDS score threshold of nearly 0.8, and the least selective
subset was defined by a CATDS score threshold of less than 0.23. Thus,
these observations suggested that similar target profiles might yield
CATDS scores of different magnitudes, dependent on the relative binding
contributions of different targets and that CATDS scoring and PDs
might reflect selectivity in different ways.

Figure 2 PDs for different selectivity categories. Box plots report
the
distribution of PD values of the subsets of the most and least selective
clinical kinase inhibitors according to CATDS scores (see Materials and Methods) at different confidence levels
of ChEMBL data (top: level 2, most selective: 36 inhibitors, least
selective: 31; level 1, most selective: 38, least selective: 33) and
after applying the <10 μM activity threshold (bottom: level
2, most selective: 35 inhibitors, least selective: 31; level 1, most
selective: 36, least selective: 31).

Examples are given in Figure 3 that shows two clinical kinase inhibitors, capmatinib
and lapatinib, which both belonged to the subset of most selective
inhibitors. At confidence levels 2 and 1, capmatinib was only active
against its primary kinase target on the basis of the literature data,
also reflecting high selectivity. By contrast, lapatinib was active
against 5 and 389 targets at confidence levels 2 and 1, respectively.
After applying the activity threshold, lapatinib was annotated with
against 3 and 13 targets at confidence levels 2 and 1, respectively.
Thus, in this case, application of the activity threshold balanced
the view of lapatinib promiscuity at data confidence level 1.

Figure 3 Examples of
the most selective clinical kinase inhibitors. Two
kinase inhibitors belonging to the most selective CATDS score-based
subset are shown. For each inhibitor, the PD value on the basis of
ChEMBL data is reported at confidence levels 2 (red background) and
1 (blue background) and after applying the <10 μM activity
threshold (level 2, red outline; level 1, blue outline).

3.4 Different Binding Modes
Clinical
kinase inhibitors available in ChEMBL included 85 compounds that were
categorized as type I and 27 as type II inhibitors on the basis of
the binding mode information. Figure 4 shows the PD value distributions of type I and II
inhibitors. Because the number of type II inhibitors was much smaller
than that of type I inhibitors, statistical assessment was limited
in this case, and it was difficult to directly compare the distributions.
However, at confidence level 1, at least half of the designated type
II inhibitors were highly promiscuous, with a median PD of 295.5,
which was much larger than the median PD of 48 obtained for type I
inhibitors. Similar trends were observed after applying the activity
threshold, with PD median values of 9 and 26 for type I and type II
inhibitors, respectively. At confidence level 2, the results were
similar for type I and II inhibitors, with PD median values of 4 and
3, respectively, and outliers present in both cases. While only a
limited number of type II were available, these findings did not provide
evidence for often assumed greater selectivity of type II versus type
I inhibitors, consistent with the results and conclusions of Klaeger
et al. and earlier proposals.14

Figure 4 PDs for type
I and type II kinase inhibitors. Box plots report
the distribution of PD values for type I and type II inhibitors on
the basis of ChEMBL data at confidence levels 1 and 2 (top: level
2, type I: 75 inhibitors; type II: 24; level 1, type I: 81; type II:
26). In addition, the PD values are reported for levels 2 and 1 after
applying the <10 μM activity threshold (bottom: level 2,
type I: 75; type II: 24; level 1, type I: 79; type II: 25).

It should also be noted that 16
type I and 4 type II inhibitors
belonged to the most selective inhibitor subset according to Figure 2, whereas 22 type
I and 4 type II inhibitors belonged to the least selective subset.
Hence, there was no notable relative enrichment of the designated
type II over type I inhibitors in the most selective subset.

3.5 Chemical Probes
Clinical kinase inhibitors
classified as chemical probes represented another interesting subset
for our analysis, given that compounds used as probes typically have
rather stringent requirements for selectivity. The 164 clinical kinase
inhibitors meeting data confidence level 2 in the presence of the
activity threshold were found to contain 13 designated chemical probes
that are shown in Figure 5. For each of these inhibitors, the CATDS score is provided,
revealing the presence of a large scoring range for these putative
probes. In fact, only two of these compounds belonged to the most
selective subset (having a CATDS score of 1), whereas two others belonged
to the least selective subset (with scores of 0.15 and 0.22, respectively).
However, at high data confidence (level 2), all 13 probes were selective
(with one or two targets) or at least moderately selective (with four,
six, or nine targets). By contrast, at confidence level 1, a clear
separation was observed, as also shown in Figure 5. In this case, only four inhibitors retained
PD values of 2, and three others had PD values of 14, 16, and 38,
whereas the remaining six inhibitors were each annotated with more
than 370 or 380 targets, thus calling probe characteristics into question.
There were only 4 of 13 inhibitors with PD values of 2 at both confidence
levels 1 and 2, which could be considered meaningful chemical probes
applying stringent criteria. However, when the activity threshold
was applied to confidence level 1, the number of target annotations
for chemical probes was significantly reduced, resulting in four highly
promiscuous inhibitors (with 32, 37, 81, and 121 annotations) and
nine others with less than 10 targets per probe. Taken together, these
observations also corroborated findings by Klaeger et al. that clinical
inhibitors with assumed selectivity were often promiscuous. Figure 6 shows the two designated
chemical probes having the maximal CATDS score of 1, AZD-2014 and
SGX-523. Inhibitor AZD-2014 was only active against two targets at
data confidence levels 1 and 2 (only one after applying the activity
threshold) and belonged to the group of four preferred chemical probes
referred to above. By contrast, SGX-523 was active against a single
kinase at confidence level 2, but annotated with 376 targets at confidence
level 1, making it difficult to support its use as a probe on the
basis of available activity data. After applying the activity threshold
at level 1, SGX-523 was left with eight targets. However, weak activities
against a variety of targets were likely in this case. This comparison
illustrates the importance of comprehensive activity data analysis
for evaluating putative chemical probes.

Histograms show PD values (ChEMBL data)
of a subset of 13 clinical kinase inhibitors (bottom) designated as
chemical probes (top: confidence level 2, red background; level 1,

of chemical probes after applying the <10 μM activity threshold
(level 2, red outline; level 1, blue outline). For each inhibitor,
the CATDS score is reported (gray background).

and SGX-523) having the maximal CATDS score of 1 (gray background).
For each inhibitor, the PD value on the basis of ChEMBL data is reported
at confidence levels 2 (red background) and 1 (blue background) and
after applying the <10 μM activity threshold (level 2, red
outline; level 1, blue outline).

4 Conclusions
In this study, we have—to
our knowledge for the first time—correlated
results of an extensive cell-based kinase inhibitor profiling campaign
with those obtained by systematic mining of compound activity data
from different sources. Given the limited availability of profiling
data in the public domain, this analysis was of high interest to us,
especially considering the exploration of kinase inhibitor selectivity
versus promiscuity. The analysis was focused on kinase inhibitors
at different stages of clinical development, which are typically well
characterized experimentally. At varying activity data confidence
levels substantial differences in inhibitor promiscuity were observed.
The clinical inhibitors covered a wide spectrum of target profiles,
ranging from selective to highly promiscuous compounds, as revealed
by both chemoproteomics profiling and data mining. A subset of inhibitors
was annotated with more kinases on the basis of the activity data
than were expressed under the conditions of the profiling experiment.
In some instances, in vitro assays yielded hundreds of target annotations
for kinase inhibitors, which could not possibly translate into in
vivo settings for clinically viable compounds, thus highlighting the
likely limitations of assay relevance. It was also of interest to
determine the target profiles of kinase inhibitors with different
binding modes thought to cause differences in selectivity. However,
neither experimental profiling nor activity data mining revealed notable
differences between type I and II kinase inhibitors. Moreover, we
analyzed kinase inhibitors that were considered chemical probes, which
also complemented the results of experimental profiling. For putative
chemical probes, very different target profiles were observed and
the majority of these compounds were nonselective at different data
confidence levels. Main findings of the analysis can be summarized
as follows:(i) Cell-based kinase inhibitor profiling
and mining of available kinase activity data from medicinal chemistry
was complementary and revealed similar trends.

(ii) In part, significant differences
in promiscuity were detected for clinical kinase inhibitors.

(iii) The analysis revealed
the importance
of considering activity data extracted from databases at different
confidence levels.

(iv) At data confidence level 1, application
of an activity threshold significantly reduced PDs and balanced the
view of kinase inhibitor promiscuity.

(v) Often assumed differences in selectivity
between type I and II kinase inhibitors could not be confirmed by
cell-based profiling or systematic compound data mining.

(vi) Even clinical kinase inhibitors regarded
as chemical probes showed notable difference in PDs and contained
a subset of highly promiscuous.



In summary,
correlating the results of experimental profiling and
compound data mining has further advanced our understanding of binding
characteristics of currently most advanced kinase inhibitors, clearly
showing that there are no simple relationships between clinical performance
and selectivity versus promiscuity of these compounds. We conclude
by emphasizing that the data made available by Klaeger et al. provide
a rich source for different types of follow-up analysis. Herein, we
have focused on compound selectivity, given the applicability domain
of compound data mining. However, there are many more functional data
provided by Klaeger et al. that can be further explored via other
computational or experimental approaches.
