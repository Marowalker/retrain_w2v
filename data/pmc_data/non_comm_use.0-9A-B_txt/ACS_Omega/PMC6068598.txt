Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of misfolded protein aggregates
that form in neurodegenerative
processes of the brain is key to providing a robust marker for improved
diagnosis and evaluation of treatments. We report the development
of advanced radiotracer candidates based on the sulfoxide scaffold
found in proton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, prevacid) with inherent
affinity to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease
and related disorders (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies and the frontotemporal
degeneration syndrome). First-in-man results obtained with [18F]lansoprazole and N-methyl-[18F]lansoprazole
were used to guide the design of a set of 24 novel molecules with
suitable properties for neuroimaging with PET. Compounds were synthesized
and characterized pharmacologically, and the binding affinity of the
compounds to synthetic human tau-441 fibrils was determined. Selectivity
of binding was assessed using α-synuclein and β-amyloid
fibrils to address the key misfolded proteins of relevance in dementia.
To complete the pharmacokinetic profiling in vitro, plasma protein
binding and lipophilicity were investigated. Highly potent and selective
new radiotracer candidates were identified for further study.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
disease of ageing, characterized by a gradual decline of cognitive
and behavioral performances and subsequent deterioration of activities
in daily living. Because the diagnosis based solely on clinical manifestations
is imprecise and may thus lead to difficulties, means to accurately
diagnose the underlying molecular pathology, as well as to monitor
the effects of strategies for therapeutic intervention, are required
to mitigate the escalating impact of the disease worldwide.1−4 Abnormal aggregation of a microtubular protein called tubule-associated
unit (tau) is widely felt to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases,
such as AD, frontotemporal degeneration, progressive supranuclear
palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and chronic traumatic encephalpathy.5−8 Misfolded fragments of tau form aggregates of fibrillar matter named
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) inside neurons when a threshold concentration
is exceeded. Although monomers are believed to cause damage, the presence
of NFTs is a definitive endpoint of progressing disease and can be
imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) for diagnosis, treatment
development, and evaluation.9−12

Despite the promising results in clinical studies
using investigational
radioligands for tau imaging, the first generation of radiotracers
designed for the detection of NFTs in brain is not yet suitable for
routine clinical use. Low specific signal in brain, heterogeneous
nonspecific binding, blood–brain barrier penetrating radiometabolites,
and cross-affinity to other proteins hamper the current application
of the technology.13−15 For instance, [18F]T807 has shown to bind
to monoamino oxidase A with high affinity, which might contribute
to tracer binding in tau-rich regions outside the striatum.15 [18F]THK-5351, another tau tracer
currently in clinical trials, shows high affinity for monoamino oxidase
B, which is expressed in activated microglia, associated with inflammation
and neurodegeneration and which also contributes to nonspecific binding
in relevant brain regions. Therefore, further investigation is needed
to obtain more specific radiotracers with an improved clinical scope
for the detection of NFTs in the brain.

Our objective is to
identify new, specific ligands binding to synthetic
aggregated paired helical filaments (PHFs) of human tau (hTau).16 In practice, only lipophilic small molecules
(M < 450 g/mol) labeled with the short-lived radionuclides 11C (t1/2 = 20 min) or 18F (t1/2 = 110 min) provide optimal chemical,
physical, and pharmacological properties for design of reversibly
binding PET radiotracers. Because of the cost and handling constraints
originating from a short half-life, clinical radiotracers should preferably
be labeled with 18F.

NFTs are challenging targets
for small-molecule ligands. In contrast
to functional proteins, they constitute macromolecular assemblies
composed of misfolded tau fragments. These fragments are formed in
low concentration during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases
and do not possess functional binding pockets. Most known ligands
are derived from aromatic dyes binding to residual β-sheet folds
in the NFT superstructure, which complicates selective detection of
NFTs over other misfolded proteins with intrinsic β-sheet structures,
e.g., β-amyloid or α-synuclein.17−21

Results and Discussion
Lead Validation in Clinical
Imaging
Proton pump inhibitor
lansoprazole (1, 2-(((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)sulfinyl)-1H-benzoimidazole) caught our attention when NFT binding
and some inherent selectivity over other misfolded protein aggregates
were associated with the drug.22−25 For lead compounds astemizole and lansoprazole, in vitro affinities
of 1.9 ± 0.1 and 2.5 ± 0.4 nM to heparin-induced tau filaments
(HITFs) and 2.1 ± 0.1 and 830 ± 180 nM to paired helical
tau filaments (PHF-Tau) were determined by radioligand binding assays.22 The selective interaction of 1 with
PHF-Tau was further proved by a comparison of immunohistochemical
staining of PHF-Tau. Although it was not possible to obtain crystal
structures of the native tau protein to obtain information about the
binding site of 1, the authors were able to show a strong
interaction of 1 with hexapeptide 386TDHGAE391 located
in the center of PHF-Tau. Taking these promising preclinical results
into account, 1 as a registered medicinal product is
safe and well suited for human application, which allowed for PET
studies to deduce the risk of progressing with the compound. Hence,
we initiated a first-in-man PET study in a small group of healthy
volunteers to obtain information on the kinetic profile of 18F-labeled lansoprazole in the brain. To our dismay, [18F]1 had a very limited brain uptake because of N–H-acidity
(pKa ∼ 4) of the imidazolyl sulfoxide
moiety.25 Another hypothetical culprit
may be near quantitative plasma protein binding; the irreversible, covalent
mechanism of action as a proton pump inhibitor; or active transport
via multidrug resistance-proteins.25

Previous experiments in animals suggested that methylation of the
nitrogen in the benzimidazole scaffold leads to higher brain uptake;
however, clinical data has not been reported to the best of our knowledge.
We therefore progressed with a clinical study to investigate N-methyl-[18F]lansoprazole ([18F]2) in comparison to lead [18F]1. The
study was approved by the regional Ethics Committee (SSM Oriente),
and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Inclusion
criteria for all participants were age of 50–70 years, not
having clinical signs of any neurological or psychiatric disorder,
and using anticontraceptives for at least 6 months after last imaging
visit in case of possible pregnancy. [18F]1 was obtained in 1.4 ± 0.5% radiochemical yield (RCY) with >98% radiochemical purity (RCP) and molar activity (Am) of 80–98 GBq/μmol (2.5 Ci/μmol).
[18F]2 was obtained in 2.1 ± 1.4% RCY
with >98% RCP and molar activity of 230–310 GBq/μmol
(6 Ci/μmol). A total of four healthy volunteers (mean age 60.2
± 6.0 years) were included to study the physiological distribution
of [18F]1 and [18F]2 in the human brain. All subjects received a single intravenous bolus
injection of 300–350 MBq of either [18F]1 or [18F]2 with an injected mass in the range
of 0.1–1.5 μg. PET images were corrected for motion,
fused to individual T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
computed tomography scans, and normalized to Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) space. Standard volume of interest (VOI) maps were
outlined from the available brain atlas in MNI space for frontal cortex,
temporal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex, whole brain, white
matter, and cerebellar cortex as reference regions. Time–activity
curves (TACs) were calculated for all brain regions, and brain uptake
was calculated in percent injected dose (% i.D.) in the whole brain
at different time points.

For the whole brain, peak uptakes
of 2.5–3.5% i.D. for [18F]1 and 5.0–6.0%
i.D. for [18F]2 were observed during the initial
perfusion phase
1 min postinjection (p.i.). For [18F]1, most
of the activity was confined to the venous vascularization, dropping
fast to less than 1.0% i.D. at 2 min p.i. and below 0.5% after 90
min. [18F]2 showed good penetration into brain
tissue and fast, homogeneous clearance from the brain. Radioactivity
concentrations in brain were about 3.0, 2.0, and 1.3% of the injected
dose at 10, 27, and 90 min, respectively. In general, an uptake of
3.0–5.0% i.D. in brain can be considered suitable for the application
of a tracer for neuroimaging. The comparative study revealed attractive
characteristics for radiotracer development inherent to the scaffold.
Fast clearance and no indications on binding to targets in the healthy
brain other than in white matter have been observed (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Top: transversal, sagittal, and coronal views
of averaged PET/MRI
fusion images of [18F]1 (left) and [18F]2 (right) 75 min postinjection. Bottom: (A) time–activity
curves (TACs) of [18F]2 in the frontal lobe
(blue), temporal lobe (green), cortical gray matter (black), white
matter (white), and cerebellum (red); (B) comparison of TACs for [18F]1 (circles) and [18F]2 (diamonds) in cortical gray and white matter, respectively.

Of particular importance here
is the complete absence of specific
binding in any brain region including the striatum, indicating that
lead [18F]2 has a negligible affinity toward
monoamino oxidase A and B, typically expressed in this region. The
phenomenon of white matter binding is in accordance with previously
reported results observed for other NFT PET tracers, perhaps related
to the high amount of β-sheet-rich myelin tissue in white matter.
This is not a desired characteristic for a tau imaging agent but confirms
the brain penetration of the tracer and is not an issue for further
progression as it is cleared rapidly from the tissue.

On this
basis, we decided to develop the lead into a library of
new ligands with a chemical and pharmacological profile suitable for
PET imaging, in particular by increasing the in vitro affinity toward
HITF and the selectivity over α-synuclein and β-amyloid
fibrils and by increasing brain permeability.

Compound Design
The scaffold of 1 was
used as a template to design molecules with the desired physical,
chemical, and pharmacological characteristics. During the design phase,
permeative properties derived from in silico data such as polar surface
area (tPSA), partition coefficients (log P, log D7.4), molecular weight,
and molecular volume were used for guidance.26,27Figure 2 shows the
lead radioligands and the design of new derivatives.

Figure 2 Top: lansoprazole (1) and N-methyl-lansoprazole
(2) the original leads. Bottom: dissection of lansoprazole
into building blocks (blue, green) and generic scheme depicting the
design of new analogues.

Using retrosynthesis, the lead was segmented into three building
blocks: the heteroaryl building block (variable, blue), the central
sulfoxide function (green), and the arylmethyl building block (variable,
red). New compounds were designed by combining such basic building
blocks in silico. The library obtained was filtered for key criteria
of relevance for its purpose. For example, the combined mass of all
three components should not exceed 450 g/mol and one moiety should
allow for direct, nucleophilic radiolabeling using no-carrier-added
[11C]CH3I and/or 18F-fluoride ion.
Particular emphasis was put on mapping the activity and selectivity
of new derivatives devoid of the benzimidazol-N–H function.
The following selection criteria were applied (in weighted order):1. Polar surface area
<80 Å2

2. Aliphatic, primary C–F bond

3. Log D7.4 > log P; 1.5

4. Molecular
weight, M < 450 g/mol

5. Molecular volume, Vm (candidate) = Vm(lead) ±
15%

6. Aliphatic, secondary
C–F bond
or aromatic C–F bond



Synthesis of
Compounds
To obtain new derivatives based
on these constraints, building blocks were synthesized when necessary
or procured when commercially available. Segmentation into such simple
building blocks facilitated the synthesis of final compounds in only
two synthetic steps. The compound library closely resembled the original
template under exclusion of the acidic proton. A number of compounds
accommodate reliable 18F-labeling protocols and some structural
variation.

Despite several attempts, the nitro-function in the
starting material proved to be difficult to substitute for alkoxy
substituents directly. In addition, some nucleophiles such as sodium p-methoxybenzylate and sodium tert-butyl-dimethylsilylate
underwent oxidation even under Ar or N2 as observed by
NMR. We attributed the issue to an unusually stable isomer,28 formed in an intramolecular attack centered
on a hyperconjugated pyridine nitrogen to form (1-oxopyridin-1-ium-4(1H)-ylidene)azinate (Scheme 1, II). The intermediate would constitute a stable compound
with low electrophilicity on the ipso-carbon of the leaving group,
thus preventing the Meisenheimer complex necessary for SNAr reactions. To circumvent the issue, we introduced a chloro substituent
using tert-butyl hypochloride (t-BuOCl) to obtain the 4-chloropyridine analogues in 80–95% yield.29−31 Substitution
of the chloride was still hampered by somewhat low yields and competing
formation of oxidation products. An optimization of the reaction conditions
led to the omission of excess alcoholic solvent; instead, 3 equiv
of 2-fluoroethanol was added dropwise to dimethylformamide containing
stoichiometric NaH. The obtained solution was reacted with 4a–d to afford alkyl aryl ether 5a–d in only 25% yield.42 Ether 5a–d was
converted to pyridine derivative 7a–d using a sequence of transformations. In brief, acylation of the
N-oxide, followed by a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement was used to
install the benzylic oxy-function. Hydrolysis of the acetyl intermediate
with NaOH afforded the product in 72–93% yield over three steps
in one pot. Compound 7a–f was treated
with thionyl chloride to obtain the pyridine building block 8a–f in 67–98% yield.32,33 Via this route, pyridines were synthesized in an overall yield of
about 10% over six steps.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Synthesis Routes to
Pyridines 8a–f
Pyridine fluorination was achieved on intermediates 6b and 6e using the method of Fier and Hartwig.34 Because of technical limitations, AgF2 had to be handled without the precautions indicated by the authors.
As a result, best yields were obtained when using fresh AgF2. Nonetheless, we obtained a 60% yield with fresh AgF2 in contrast to the original report of 81% isolated fluoropyridine 6e. An aged sample of silver difluoride in stock gave only
31% 6f.

Final compounds were obtained under fairly
mild conditions as follows.
Compounds 9a–e were treated with
aqueous NaOH (3 equiv) and allowed to react with pyridines 8a–f for 1 h at room temperature (rt). Compounds 10a–v were isolated in an overall yield
of 70–90% and characterized. Isolation is not strictly necessary
prior to the final oxidation, which eased scale-up of the reaction.
Direct oxidation to furnish radiotracer candidates 11a–v was achieved with meta-chloroperbenzoic
acid (m-CPBA, 1.1 equiv) in low to moderate yields
of 25–40%. We attributed some low yield to overoxidation of
the sulfur and nitrogen. However, no further attempts were made to
optimize the reaction at this point because sufficient amounts were
available for biological studies (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 General Scheme for the Synthesis of Final Compounds over Two Steps
Characterization
Traditionally, binding of candidate
molecules to the target of interest is the first and foremost selection
criterion for the development of a PET radiotracer. To visualize a
target, a reasonable ratio between the available number of binding
sites (Bavail) and dissociation constant kd, also termed binding potential, is crucial.
In the case of misfolded protein pathology, the expression patterns
differ between diseases, from subject to subject and with the disease
stage.2−4,35 Therefore, we surmised
that an optimal candidate would (1) bind to hTau-441 NFT with equal
or better affinity than lead compounds 1 and 2 and (2) have a suitable selectivity for NFT over α-synuclein
and β-amyloid and show better brain uptake. We tested all compounds
for their binding characteristics to hTau-441, α-synuclein,
and β-amyloid fibrils. A number of reference compounds were
included to improve our understanding of the structure–activity
relationship between imidazolyl-sulfoxides and misfolded protein aggregates.
In addition to binding, we had to keep in mind the insufficient brain
uptake of the lead structure, which leads us to investigate additional
pharmacological parameters such as the lipophilicity and the protein-bound
fraction in plasma of each candidate.

Because the purity of
each test compound had to be determined prior to binding studies,
we devised a purpose-made high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
method derived from OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals.36 The HPLC method was calibrated using 30 reference
compounds to allow for simultaneous determination of purity and of
the distribution coefficient log D7.4 as a surrogate of lipophilicity (Supporting Information).

To assess the effect of structural modification
on plasma protein
binding, a plasma dialysis method was developed and validated. Porcine
full blood was used because of its similarity to human blood. Samples
were obtained, and plasma was separated. Following incubation of compounds 11a–v as well as internal standards, plasma
was subjected to membrane dialysis and the protein-free plasma samples
were analyzed by HPLC (Supporting Information). Plasma protein binding remained high for all compounds in both
pig and human blood. Notable exceptions include compounds 11e and 11o, which show a remarkable drop in activity of
10–20% relative to the rest of the series.

To determine
the interaction of the new compounds with different
misfolded proteins, we compared their in vitro binding affinity toward
synthetic fibrils composed of hTau-441, α-synuclein, and β-amyloid.
We decided to work with synthetic fibrils in this stage to avoid issues
commonly associated with screening for binding in tissue samples.
The main disadvantage of binding assays performed with the human (or
animal) tissue specimen is false positive assessment of the binding
profile, particularly when working with misfolded protein pathology.
This is due to low target expression on one hand and substantial co-localization
of functional proteins (e.g., butyryl choline esterase and monoamino
oxidase) in both tau and amyloid brain lesions on the other. Reversible
binding to these proteins may have mislead researchers in their structural
optimization efforts, thus creating a cross-affinity to additional
targets as reported previously. Nevertheless, we intend to evaluate
the most promising candidates identified in this work by autoradiography
(AR) on human tissue at a later time points to verify their affinity
toward PHF-Tau.

Binding Affinity to hTau-441
Synthetic
fibrils were
prepared by aggregation of hTau-441 in the presence of Heparin at
37 °C for 7 days during which the aggregation process was monitored
by light scattering to investigate the size of the aggregate fibrils.
At baseline conditions, only one distinct species with a hydrodynamic
radius, rh, of 322 nm was detected. At
later time points up to 7 days, this species pertained (rh = 322 nm) alongside some larger aggregates and small
fragments. A globular protein of 60 kDa mass has an approximate rh of 3.4 nm, which increases to about 5.1 nm
at 150 kDa, which suggests that distinct aggregates are already present
after 1 day of incubation.

In addition, we validated the fibrils
and assay conditions for every aggregation batch by verifying maximum
binding, displacement, and dissociation constant (kd) using [3H]astemizole as the reference ligand
as previously described.22 Therefore, synthetic
fibrils were freshly suspended in buffer and incubated with the radioligand
in the presence of increasing concentration of 1 × 10–10–3 × 10–5 M non-radioactive astemizole
and the calculated kd was compared to
literature values for quality control.

Binding affinities of
new reference compounds toward hTau-441 fibrils
were determined by inhibition of [3H]astemizole measured
by autoradiography (AR) and at radioligand concentrations that gave
the best specific signal. Reference compounds were tested at 10 concentrations
spanning 1 × 10–10–1 × 10–5 M, and inhibition potency was determined (half-maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50)).

Of a total of 24 newly synthesized
compounds, we obtained reliable
data for 19 compounds in the range of 0.2–100.0 nM (IC50). Derivatives containing the ethoxy-substituted (11a, 11d, and 11g) and nonsubstituted “azol”
structures are almost devoid of any simple trend of potency. It appears
that fluorine or fluorinated aliphatic moieties are tolerated to a
lesser extent, perhaps reflecting electrostatic or steric effects
in the binding environment. As a result, the presence of the 4-methoxypyridine
residue is highly beneficial for the overall potency (11d–f). Again, some trend is observed within the
respective benzothiazole series throughout all pyridine moieties (e.g., 11a, 11d, and 11g), of which the
more electron-rich methoxy derivative (11d) demonstrates
the highest potency of this series.

In contrast, introduction
of the electron-withdrawing pyrrole substituent
affects binding in a different way and the lowest affinity is found
for the of the N-methyl imidazoles series (11k, 11n, and 11q). In fact, the
rotamers show a remarkable distinction of their respective potencies
(see Supporting Information for structure
assignment by NMR). Whereas the corresponding syn-series (11l, 11o, and 11r) shows low nanomolar inhibition
potency, the syn-analogues are between 8- and 20-fold less affine
and require such high ligand concentration for displacement of astemizole
that we approached the edge of quantification in our assay. Another
intriguing observation is the pronounced effect of the imidazole-N–H
function within the pyrrole series (11j and 11p). Relative to the other pyrrolyl derivatives, these two molecules
are remarkably potent binders of hTau but show only a small increase
in inhibition binding to α-synuclein and β-amyloid. These
findings indicate that the imidazole proton or its direct vicinity
plays a major role in both the binding affinity and selectivity of
binding among the three misfolded protein species. Unfortunately,
pronounced N–H-acidity in these derivatives renders brain uptake
very unlikely.

Interestingly, N-methyl derivatives
devoid of
the pyrrole substituent did not show significant affinity toward hTau-441,
except compound 11t, which binds with very high affinity.
Phenomenologically, this may be attributed to the lack of conformational
rigidity because no stable rotamers are present in these structures.

Nonetheless, in the light of these results, we plan to carry forward 11d, 11i, 11j, and 11t for direct comparison with 1 and other derivatives
to further elucidate the mechanism of binding. All compounds except 11i have a very high affinity around 1.0 nM and are superior
to both leads 1 and 2 in this regard.

Binding Affinity to α-Synuclein and β-Amyloid
All compounds were furthermore analyzed for their binding potency
toward α-synuclein and β-amyloid fibrils using well-established
and validated binding assays with thioflavin-T fluorescence as read-out
(for details, see Supporting Information) to determine whether structural modifications influence the selectivity
of the original lead.

Because the compound library was primarily
designed to produce hTau-binding compounds, we simplified the assay
as much as possible and tested all compounds at three concentrations
(10, 100, and 1000 nM) in triplicate for their inhibition of thioflavin
binding to the fibrils. To calculate selectivity, we assumed that
compounds showing less than 50% inhibition at the highest concentration
of 1000 nM would have IC50 values >1000 nM, which could
be considered as negligible. Should a significant inhibition of binding
to α-synuclein or β-amyloid fibrils be observed, we would
perform a concentration-dependent inhibition assay to obtain exact
IC50 values.

For the purpose of assay validation,
the aggregation of synthetic
fibrils was monitored with thioflavin-T dyes for 7 days as described
previously. Total binding of dye to fibrils in the absence of inhibitor
was roughly 20-fold higher than nonspecific signal in the presence
of a saturating concentration of LDS-798. These parameters translate
to a robust assay with a pronounced effect. Studies with the reference
compound LDS-798 showed concentration-dependent displacement of dye
binding to α-synuclein and β-amyloid. To minimize the
nonspecific signal as well as the noise from the fluorescence detection,
plates were pre-read before addition of thioflavin-T to determine
autofluorescence of the test solutions.

Among the novel radiotracer
candidates tested, most compounds have
shown very little displacement of the fluorescent dye thioflavin-T
from aggregated α-synuclein. On the other hand, some binding
to β-amyloid fibrils was apparent for most test compounds at
the highest concentration of 1000 nM, for which a variable but low
degree of displacement was observed. Values range between 9 and 32%
inhibition; however, no pronounced inhibition potency was observed
for any of the new entities 11a–v at lower concentrations of 10 and 100 nM. With less than 50% inhibition
at 1000 nM, we conclude that the IC50 would be >1000
nM
and represent a negliable affinity toward both fibrils.

In terms
of structural attributes, the binding to β-amyloid
fibrils shows some correlation with the individual lipophilicity of
compounds within each series. As a general trend (11a–c, 11d–f, and 11g–i), the lowest potency of inhibition
is found in the most lipophilic analogue. A more electron-rich “azol”-heterocycle
appears to benefit a lower potency as well. The trend persists within
the respective series with a constant pyridine motif (a–c, d–f, and g–i). The 3-methyl-4-trifluoroethoxypyrid-2-yl-methyl
residue generally produces the least potent derivative in the series.
When introducing an electron-withdrawing pyrrole substituent, the
trends are gravely affected. Interestingly, the syn-rotamer (11l, 11o, and 11r) of all N-methyl pyrrolobenzimidazoles is significantly less potent
than the anti-rotamer (11k, 11n, and 11q), whereas the desmethyl analogues (11j, 11m, and 11p) show the most pronounced displacement,
indicating some importance of the imidazole-N–H for β-amyloid
fibril binding.

LDS-798 and 1 displaced the dye
from β-amyloid
at 1000 nM very well, which is in line with an expected strong interaction
with fibrils. When tested, 1 did not show competitive
inhibition of thioflavin-T binding, which is in line with (a lack
of) corresponding literature evidence. We presume that astemizole
binds in a different part of the misfolded protein, unlike thioflavin
S and T, which are known to interact with β-sheet folds.

The results obtained from α-synuclein and β-amyloid
binding studies indicate a low tendency of most novel candidates to
bind misfolded proteins other than NFTs. These results bode for selective
interaction with the target of interest, which is crucial in the development
of selective PET radiotracers for NFT imaging.

We selected compounds 11i and 11t for
further progression and 11d and 11j as backup
as these provide the most attractive or outstanding combination of
properties (Figure 3, highlighted in orange). As part of future studies, these compounds
will be labeled with 18F and/or 11C for μPET
imaging studies in healthy mice and animal models of AD to prove their
capacity for brain penetration and target interaction. In addition,
autoradiography on healthy human tissue and samples of patients with
different taupathies as well as radioligand binding assays using brain
homogenates will be performed in the near future.

Conclusions
Herein, we report the lead validation of
[18F]lansoprazole
by human PET imaging to support chemical synthesis of a small library
of lansoprazole analogues designed with the aim of identifying potential
radiotracer candidates for PET imaging. Compounds were designed with
the aid of calculated properties, and following synthesis were successively
characterized in vitro with emphasis on pharmacological criteria of
relevance for brain imaging studies. Binding affinities were measured
against synthetic hTau-441, β-amyloid, and α-synuclein
fibrils. Lipophilicity and plasma protein binding were investigated
experimentally using HPLC and membrane dialysis protocols. The data
was used to gather a preliminary understanding of the structure–activity
relationship for heteroarylmethyl-sulfoxides with respect to protein
binding to successively optimize the lead. On the basis of the dataset,
candidates 11i and 11t were selected for
radiolabeling to allow for further progression into the preclinical
imaging stage to assess the performance of new compounds as NFT imaging
agents in human tissue sections and animal models. Derivatives 11d and 11j will be investigated in vitro and
in silico to assess the importance of their structural features for
binding.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals,
reagents, and
solvents used in the experimental work were of highest commercially
available quality and applied without further purification. Materials
used herein were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich AS, Norway),
VWR (VWR International, Norway), Acros Organics (Now VWR International),
Strem, ABCR, Combi-Blocks, and Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific
AS, Oslo, Norway) unless specified here. 5-(1H-Pyrrol-1-yl)-2-mercaptobenzimidazole
was obtained from Carbosynth (Carbosynth Limited, Berkshire, U.K.).
The [18F]fluoride ion for radioactive work was obtained
from Norwegian Medical Cyclotron Centre AS (Gaustad, Oslo, Norway).
Solid phase extraction cartridges, Sep-Pak Accell plus light QMA cartridges,
and Sep-Pak C18 plus light cartridges were purchased from Waters (Waters
International, Norway).

Characterization of synthesized compounds
was performed using an AVIII HD 400 nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer
(Bruker ASX Nordic, Oslo, Norway). Chloroform-d (CDCl3; δ = 7.226 ppm) was used as the reference standard.
Chemical shifts (δ) for 1H (400 MHz), 13C (100 MHz), and 19F (377 MHz) NMR are reported in parts
per million (ppm). High-resolution mass spectrometry was conducted
on a micromass Q-Tof-2 mass analyzer (Waters International, Oslo,
Norway) and maXis II ETD (Bruker ASX Nordic, Oslo, Norway) using electron
spray ionization in positive mode (ESI+). High-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) was performed on an analytical HPLC system (Agilent
technologies, California) equipped with a quaternary pump, diode array
detector (DAD), and sodium iodide detector (NaI crystal; 2 ×
2) using GABI-star software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) for
UV and radioactive quantifications.

Chemical
purity and lipophilicity (log D7.4) of the final compounds was determined on a Shimadzu
iProminence HPLC system (Shimadzu Europa GmbH, Duisburg, Germany)
using a Chromolith RP-18e column (100 × 4.6 mm2; Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) as a stationary phase and mixtures of methanol–50
mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer, 1:1, or methanol–50
mM phosphate-buffered saline buffer, 70:30, as mobile phases with
a flow rate of 2 mL/min. Complementary confirmation of the chemical
purity of synthesized compounds was obtained using a pentafluorophenyl-functionalized
reversed-phase column as a stationary phase (Luna PFP(2), 5 μm;
100 Å; 150 × 4.6 mm2 column; Phenomenex, Norway)
and a mixture of MeCN–H2O, 30:70, at a flow rate
of 2 mL/min as a mobile phase or using a Thermo Scientific device
(Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000 HPLC, Chromeleon) consisting of a
quaternary pump, diode array detector (220 nm), and autosampler using
an Ascentis Express C18 analytical column (150 × 4.6
mm2, 2.7 μm particle size): eluent A: MeCN, eluent
B: 0.1% formic acid, flow rate 1.0 mL/min, gradient method: 5% MeCN
(0–5 min), 5–100% MeCN (5–15 min). Electrospray
ionization mass spectra were obtained using a MSQ mass detector (Thermo
Scientific). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was conducted using silica
gel plates (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) with a fluorescence indicator
(F254) or Macherey-Nagel (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Düren,
Germany) precoated plastic sheets with fluorescent indicator UV254
(Polygram SIL G/UV254). Visualization of the spots was effected by
irradiation with an UV lamp (254 and 366 nm). A miniGITA radioTLC
scanner (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) was used for the detection
of radioTLC spots. Radioactivity measurements were performed with
an Atomlab 300 dose calibrator (Biodex medical systems Inc.) and activity
is reported in Becquerel (Bq, s–1).

Radiochemistry
All reagents, solvents, and reference
compound 1 were purchased from Merck Millipore or Sigma-Aldrich
in pharmaceutical grade. Difluorovinyl precursors for 1 (2-(((5-((2,2-difluorovinyl)oxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)-methyl)sulfinyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole) (3a)
and 2 (2-(((4-((2,2-difluorovinyl)oxy)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)-methyl)sulfinyl)-1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazole) (3b)
were prepared as described previously. [18F]Fluoride ([18F]F–) was produced via the 18O(p,n)18F nuclear reaction using an IBA Cyclone 18/9 cyclotron.

General Procedure for Synthesis of Compounds 10a–v
2-Merceptobenzoxa- and -thiazoles, 9a–e (1.1 equiv), were treated with a
solution of NaOH (3 equiv) in H2O (10 mL) for 10 min at
room temperature (rt). Respective pyridine building blocks, 8a–f (1.0 equiv), were dissolved separately
in H2O (2 mL) and added slowly to the reaction mixture.
Precipitate formation was observed immediately on addition, and reaction
contents were allowed to stir for 1 h at rt. The reaction mixture
was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 20 mL) and the organic
layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4, and
concentrated in vacuo to obtain the respective sulfides (10a–v).

General Procedure for Synthesis of Compounds 11a–v
Oxidation of sulfide intermediates 10a–v (1.0 equiv) was achieved using portions
of meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA, 1.1 equiv) in CHCl3 (8–10 mL) at 0 °C
for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with NaHCO3 (10 mL)
and extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) (3 × 10 mL). The organic
extracts were combined, washed with brine (20 mL), and dried over
Na2SO4 to obtain the crude product. The product
was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with MeOH–DCM,
1:9, to isolate the respective sulfoxides (11a–v).
