Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are the main olfactory
proteins
of mosquitoes, and their structures have been widely explored to develop
new repellents. In the present study, we combined ligand- and structure-based
virtual screening approaches using as a starting point 1633 compounds
from 71 botanical families obtained from the Essential Oil Database
(EssOilDB). Using as reference the crystallographic structure of N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide
interacting with the OBP1 homodimer of Anopheles gambiae (AgamOBP1), we performed a structural and pharmacophoric
similarity search to select potential natural products from the library. Thymol acetate, 4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal, thymyl isovalerate,
and p-cymen-8-yl demonstrated a favorable chemical
correlation with DEET and also had high-affinity interactions with
the OBP binding pocket that molecular dynamics simulations showed
to be stable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to evaluate on a large scale the potentiality of NPs from essential
oils as inhibitors of the mosquito OBP1 using in silico approaches.
Our results could facilitate the design of novel repellents with improved
selectivity and affinity to the protein binding pocket and can shed
light on the mechanism of action of these compounds against insect
olfactory recognition.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Mosquitoes are the main
agents of vector-borne diseases in the
tropical regions of the world, causing a high social, economic, and
public health impact on these affected regions.1,2 The
disruption of mosquito–human interaction remains one of the
most efficient prophylaxis methods against these diseases, and research
on chemical repellents against mosquitoes has advanced due to the
understanding of mosquito behavior and chemical olfactory receptors.3−5

The olfactory system of insects involves diverse transmembrane
odorant receptor proteins located in olfactory membrane neurons, which
are expressed in different parts of the insect body.6 These odorant receptors evolved to respond to several functions
in the mosquito life cycle, such as identification of pheromones for
reproduction and chemical signals for host recognition.6−8 The odorant-binding protein 1 (OBP1) is the main olfactory protein
involved in the host-seeking mechanism of mosquitoes. The 3D structure
of OBP1 is well-conserved across different mosquito species that are
vectors of human diseases, such as Aedes aegypti (Protein Data Bank ID: 3K1E),9Anopheles
gambiae (3V2L and 3R1O),10 and Culex quinquefasciatus (3OGN),11 and its structure has been widely investigated
for structure-oriented development of novel repellents.12−14 DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) is one of the most effective, commercially available
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved repellents, providing
good residual protection against a broad spectrum of insects.15,16 Its action against OBPs has been extensively investigated as an
attractive approach to developing novel bio-inspired repellent compounds
by combining ligand- and structure-based approaches.17,18 However, different studies have reported behavioral insensitivity
of different insect species to DEET, which could implicate some inefficiency
in its repellency activity.19−21

With the increased interest
in developing new mosquito repellents
from natural products (NPs), essential oils are considered an interesting
source due to their widely diverse class of volatile and low-molecular-weight
compounds and also to their ovicidal, larvicidal, and repellent activities
against human disease vectors.22−26 With the resurgence of NPs in the development of new bioactive compounds
by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries27−30 and due to the cutting-edge technologies
of combinatory chemistry, cheminformatics, and molecular modeling,
new studies have focused on essential oils to explore their potentiality
as mosquito repellents.23,31,32 Recently, we have used different computational approaches to investigate
biomolecular systems with emphasis on enzymatic reaction and inhibition.33−37 In the present study, using an in silico approach, we performed
a comprehensive analysis of the potentiality of 1633 compounds from
the essential oils of 71 botanical families deposited in the Essential
Oil Database (EssOilDB)38 by combining
a structure- and ligand-based virtual screening, using as reference
the structure of DEET complexed to the OBP1 homodimer of A. gambiae (AgamOBP1). We also investigated
the affinity and selectivity of these compounds against AgamOBP1 through docking techniques allied with molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation and binding free energy calculations.

2 Results and Discussion
In the present
study, we applied a structure- and ligand-based
virtual screening approach starting with 1633 compounds from 71 botanical
families obtained from the EssOilDB (see the complete list in Table S1). We used as reference the crystallographic
structure of DEET interacting with the AgamOBP1 homodimer,
a relevant odorant protein involved in host-seeking recognition by
insects. Using a pharmacophoric prediction and structural similarity
search, we analyzed the similarity of these compounds with the reference
structure. Then, using docking techniques, MD simulation, and binding
free energy calculations, we investigated the potentiality of these
compounds as inhibitors of AgamOBP1. Our results
are further discussed in the following sections.

2.1 Structure-Based Filtering and Similarity Search
A total of 121 compounds from essential oils were obtained after
3D structural similarity filtering using a Tanimoto cutoff of 0.7.
After pharmacophoric filtering, 29 compounds were obtained. Two pharmacophoric
models were selected: (1) The first model considered the interatomic
interactions of the crystallographic structure together with the findings
of a previous 3D quantitative structure–activity study of DEET.4,39 This model comprises one aromatic hydrophobic function located in
the aromatic ring, two aliphatic hydrophobic functions at the methyl
groups of the diethylamine chain, and one hydrogen-bond acceptor formed
by the carboxylic group (Figure 1A). (2) The second model considers the relevance of
apolar interactions of DEET in the hydrophobic tunnel and contains
an additional aliphatic hydrophobic function formed by the methyl
group adjacent to the aromatic ring (Figure 1B). The molecular structure of DEET is shown
in Figure 1C.

pharmacophoric models used to filter the NPs from
essential oils. The green circles highlight the aromatic and aliphatic
hydrophobic functions, and the orange ones are for the hydrogen-bond
acceptor function. (C) Molecular conformer of DEET complexed to AgamOBP1.

Based on the physicochemical and structural correlation
of the
NPs with commercial repellents obtained with PCA, we selected six
compounds to determine their selectivity and affinity to the AgamOBP1 binding pocket using molecular docking, MD simulation,
and binding free energy calculations. The carvacryl acetate and thymol
acetate were selected due to their well-known repellent activity against
different insect species;40−43 thus, they could be used for a comparative analysis
with the other natural products. The compounds thymyl isovalerate,
4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal, and p-cymen-8-yl were
selected due to their closely physicochemical correlation with commercial
repellents DEET and DEPA, as shown by the PCA plot, and the p-anisyl hexanoate was selected due to its structural and
pharmacophoric similarities to crystallographic DEET. The common name,
chemical class, structural similarity (RMSD and Tanimoto 3D), and
some origin species of the selected compounds are shown in Table 1.

Investigate Their Affinity against AgamOBP1 Binding
Pocketa
a The compounds are identified by
molecular structure, common name, chemical class, structural similarity
to DEET (Tanimoto 3D value and RMSD), and some origin species.

The compounds p-cymen-8-yl, thymol
acetate, carvacryl
acetate, 4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal, thymyl isovalerate, and p-anisyl hexanoate showed satisfactory structural similarity
with DEET according to the following Tanimoto 3D values: 0.80, 0.79,
0.71, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively. Supporting this structural
similarity, p-cymen-8-yl, thymol acetate, carvacryl
acetate, 4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal, and thymyl isovalerate also
exhibited a favorable physicochemical correlation with commercial
repellents. Figure 2 depicts the PCA scatter plot; the first circle highlights the correspondence
between the NPs 2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxypropiophenone, methyl N-methylanthranilate, and (S)-1-(4-acetoxyphenyl)propyl
acetate with the repellents dimethyl phthalate (DBP), methylanthranilate,
and 3-cyclohexyl propanoic acid. The second circle highlights the
chemical correspondence between NPs thymol acetate, carvacryl acetate,
4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal, benzyl (2S)-2-methylbutanoate,
thymyl isovalerate, and p-cymen-8-yl with the commercial
repellents N,N-diethyl phenylacetamide
(DEPA) and DEET. We obtained the following variance percentage for
the principal components: 44.22% (PC1), 26.10% (PC2), and 16.79% (PC3).
The raw data of compound properties (NPs and repellents) used to calculate
the PCA is available in Table S2.

Figure 2 Scatter plot
showing the chemical space of the NPs and the commercially
used repellents. The x, y, and z axes exhibit the contribution of each principal component
for the chemical profile of the compounds. The selected compounds
are identified by color arrows: p-cymen-8-yl (blue),
thymol acetate (red), carvacryl acetate (yellow), and 4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal
(green), thymyl isovalerate (black), and p-anisyl
hexanoate (orange).

Interestingly, several studies have highlighted
the repellent activity
of thymol and thymol acetate against different insects, which are
vectors of diseases such as Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae),40Anopheles
subpictus Grassi, Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae),42,44Culex
pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae),41 and crop pests such as Meligethes aeneus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae).31 Similarly, carvacryl acetate, a monoterpene derivative of carvacrol
found in a high percentage in the essential oils of some Lamiaceae
species such as Clinopodium sp.45 and Thymus sp.,46 has a well-reported insecticidal and oviposition deterrence against
different insect species.54,55 In addition, p-cymen-8-ol has a high repellent activity against Lasioderma serricorne Fabricius (Coleoptera: Anobiidae),47,48 and its derivative molecule p-cymene was used against A. gambiae.(49)

Several studies have reported the specific inhibitory activity
of some NPs from essential oil against insect OBPs with satisfactory
binding affinity, such as sesquiterpenes (e.g., benzaldehyde, β-myrcene,
and α-copaene)13 and alcohols (e.g., n-decanol and n-dodecanol).12 In the present study, we identified that predominantly
monoterpenoids, such as p-cymen-8-yl, thymol acetate,
and carvacryl acetate, mimic the binding mode of DEET, exhibiting
similar pharmacophoric groups and intermolecular interactions with
the protein pocket, which sheds light on the molecular mechanism of
action of these compounds against olfactory recognition of insects,
reinforcing the previous experimental repellency studies for this
chemical class.40,41,48,50

2.2 Interactions of NPs with the AgamOBP1 Binding Pocket
The AgamOBP1 structure
is composed of two monomers, each consisting of six α-helices,
with the odorant-binding pocket located at the center of a hydrophobic
tunnel through the dimeric interface.39,51 The crystallographic
structure of AgamOBP1 bound to DEET reveals that
the binding pocket cavity is formed by the residues Leu80, Leu73,
Leu76, and His77 (α-helix 4); Met91, Ala88, Met89, and Gly92
(α-helix 5); and Trp114 (α-helix 6); also, the residues
Leu96, Lys930, Arg940, and Leu960 and the two molecules of DEET bound
to the dimeric interface of AgamOBP1 interact with
each other by the methyl carbon atoms. In addition, studies have demonstrated
that odorant molecules could interact in several locations of the
OBP binding pockets with partial occupancies, that is, in the central
cavity of the monomeric subunit as well as to the OBP dimeric interface.52−54 Based on these results, we selected for docking analyses the dimeric
interface of the DEET-binding pocket located between the two monomers,
which is formed by the residues of the helices α4, α5,
and α6 (intermolecular interactions and atomic distances obtained
in docking are available in Table S3).

The noncovalent interactions formed between the AgamOBP1 binding pocket and the NPs were analyzed over 10 ns of MD simulation.
The selected NPs formed numerous hydrophobic interactions with the AgamOBP1 binding pocket, with residues Leu76, His77, Met89,
Leu96, and Trp114 repeating interactions similar to those observed
with the crystallographic structure of DEET. AgamOBP1 residues Ala88 and Trp114 formed π–alkyl interactions
with the aromatic ring of the selected compounds, and some residues,
such as Gly92, Leu73, and Met89 (chain A) as well as Lys93 and Leu96
(chain B), formed hydrogen bonds with the oxygenated groups (see Table S4). We also noted that water molecules
interact with DEET, with the residues located in the binding pocket,
such as Trp114, Asp78, Gly92, and Ser79, and with the main chain of
residues Cys95 and Gly92.

An overview of the intermolecular
interactions formed between the
residues of the AgamOBP1 binging pocket and the selected
NPs and docked DEET is shown in Figure 3 and compared with a structural superposition with
the crystallographic DEET. The diagram showing the interactions of
the six NPs with the AgamOBP1 binding pocket over
10 ns of MD simulation is shown in Figure 4. Thus, we then performed binding energy
calculations to analyze the binding affinities of the selected NPs
complexed to the AgamOBP1 pocket.

2.3 Conformational Stability of the AgamOBP1–Ligand Complexes and the Binding Affinities of the Natural
Products
The conformational stability of AgamOBP1 bound and unbound to the ligands over 100 ns of MD simulation
is shown by the RMSD plots (Figure 5). We observed that the AgamOBP1 heterodimer
complexed with the ligands reached equilibrium at 70 ns of MD simulation,
exhibiting the following average RMSD values: 1.45 ± 0.21 Å
(complexed with DEET), 1.74 ± 0.29 Å (complexed with thymol
acetate), 1.74 ± 0.32 Å (thymyl isovalerate), 1.61 ±
0.23 Å (carvacryl acetate), 1.43 ± 0.20 Å (p-cymen-8-yl), 1.93 ± 0.43 Å (p-anisyl hexanoate), and 1.49 ± 0.21 Å (4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal).
Corroborating these results, the RMSD plot of the NP structures exhibited
stability over the simulations and indicated a favorable interaction
with the AgamOBP1 binding pocket, which is also observed
for the DEET structure (Figure S1).

Figure 5 RMSD plots
of the AgamOBP1 structure bound and
unbound to the ligands obtained over 100 ns of MD simulation. (A) AgamOBP1 unbound to the ligands (black), OBP1 complexed

(blue), and carvacryl acetate (green). (B) AgamOBP1
complexed with DEET (red), thymol acetate (yellow), p-cymen-8-yl (blue), and 4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal (purple).

During the first MD simulation of the AgamOBP1-DEET
complex (positive control), we noted that the protein structure undergoes
a conformational change at 60 ns, which can be seen by the RMSD values
with a deviation of 3.0 Å (see Figure S2 for triplicate MD simulation of the AgamOBP1–DEET
complex). These increased RMSD values could be explained by the movement
of a loop segment located in the N-terminal region. Using structural
superposition (Figure S3A,B), we analyzed
the conformations of the AgamOBP1–DEET complex
before (60 ns, yellow color) and after (70 ns, blue color) the increased
RMSD values, and we noted that the protein structure maintains slight
deviations in its conformation, except for a loop segment (L1) located
at the N-terminal region. The loop segment L1 moves toward the α-helix,
leading to the formation of intermolecular interactions that stabilize
the whole protein structure (Figure S3 C). The conformational changes in the loop do not alter the AgamOBP1 active site, and the DEET structure maintains a
stable interaction with residues of the binding site.

In the
present study, we calculate the binding free energy using
SIE method.55 As seen from computational
binding results, thymyl isovalerate (−7.34 ± 0.09 kcal
mol–1), p-anisyl hexanoate (−6.85
± 0.10 kcal mol–1), and 4-(4-methylphenyl)-pentanal
(−6.81 ± 0.08 kcal mol–1) are the most
efficient inhibitors of the OBP1 odorant pocket followed by p-cymen-8-yl, carvacryl acetate, and thymol acetate (Table 2 and Table S5). Note that we have used PCA for analyzing the convergent
trajectories and selected the time interval for the binding free energy
calculation. The analysis of convergent trajectories for each complex
studied over the 100 ns of MD is depicted in Figure S4. It is also worth noting that a previous study obtained
similar results using docking energies for DEET (ΔG = −5.86 kcal mol–1 ; Ki = 50.51 μM) and potential repellents of AgamOBP1, such as 2-methyl-1-(1-oxodecyl)piperidine (ΔG = −7.36 kcal mol–1; Ki = 4.04 μM), 1-(1-oxoundecyl)piperidine (ΔG = −7.20 kcal mol–1; Ki = 5.28 μM), and N,N-diethyl-3-phenylpropanamide (ΔG = −6.49
kcal mol–1; Ki = 17.21
μM).39 Similarly, a previous study
performed binding free energy calculations using the MM/GBSA method
for β-caryophyllene (sesquiterpene), β-myrcene (monoterpene),
and cis-β-ocimene (monoterpene) complexed to
different OBP classes of Hydroides elegans, and their energy values approximated our calculated values of OBP1,13 which is also consistent with the inhibitory
activity.

The crystallographic structure of AgamOBP1 complexed
with DEET reveals that the majority of residues located at chain A,
such as Leu73, Leu76, His77, Ala88, Met91, Gly92, Lys93, and Leu96,
form hydrophobic contacts with the ligands.39 In the present study, we noted that the NPs also showed a similar
binding mode, and the residues Leu73, His77, Leu80, Ala88, Gly92,
Leu96, and Trp144 exhibited the most energetic contribution for ligand
stabilization in the AgamOBP1 binding pocket (Figure 6). In contrast, the
residues of AgamOBP1 chain B exhibited a minor contribution
to ligand stabilization, and we noted a special interaction with Met89,
Lys93, and Leu96 that was revealed as the most important to ligand
binding.

hexanoate (dark blue).

Structural waters have been reported as relevant
for the binding
stability of OBP-odorant molecules and to the OBP recognition process.39 Our analyses identified that water molecules
interact with DEET (DEET-C1 with Wat1815-O; average distance: 4.06
± 0.20 Å) and with the side chains of residues located in
the binding pocket, Trp114 (occupancy: 77.60%, Trp114-NE1 atom with
Wat1815-O; average distance: 1.97 ± 0.15 Å), and minor interactions
were noted for the residues Asp78 (occupancy: 0.25%), Gly92 (0.15%),
and Ser79 (0.20%) and with the main chain of the residues Cys95 (3.65%)
and Gly92 (0.10%). These interactions with water molecules are consistent
with the crystallographic findings. Considering the NPs, we do not
note H-bond interactions with water molecules, but similar interactions
occurred with residues of the AgamOBP1 binding pocket
when bound to thymol acetate, p-anisyl hexanoate,
and thymyl isovalerate. The non-occurrence of interactions between
water molecules and ligands could be explained by the different occupancies
formed by these NPs in the AgamOBP1 binding pocket,
which fill the same space previously occupied by the water.

Our results revealed new structural insights about the mechanism
of action of these volatile compounds sourced from aromatic plants
against the olfactory recognition of mosquitoes, and the findings
indicate that the structures of these NPs could be further validated
against AgamOBP1.

3 Conclusions
We have demonstrated that
NPs from essential oils, such as thymyl
isovalerate, thymol acetate, p-anisyl hexanoate,
and p-cymen-8-yl, mimic the binding mode of DEET,
a well-known repellent, forming hydrophobic and H-bond interactions
with the AgamOBP1 binding pocket. Our results are
supported by computational evidence, such as (1) structural, pharmacophoric,
and binding mode similarity of these compounds with that of DEET as
verified through structural alignment, pharmacophoric prediction,
and molecular docking; (2) high conformational stability of these
compounds in the OBP1 binding pocket as analyzed through MD simulations;
and (3) high predicted binding affinity of the NPs when compared with
the DEET–OBP1 complex as revealed by crystallographic structure.
We also found that thymol acetate, 4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal, thymyl
isovalerate, and p-cymen-8-yl share similar physicochemical
properties with the commercial repellents DEPA and DEET. Considering
that computational methods have been a cost-effective and predictive
approach for analyzing the binding affinity of olfactory receptors
with the odorant molecules7,56 and that they have
consequently been applied to the identification of novel potential
repellents against different insect species,57 our findings reinforce the potentiality of NPs as an interesting
source for the development of novel mosquito repellents. Further experimental
studies should be performed with the compounds p-anisyl
hexanoate and 4-(4-methyl phenyl)-pentanal.

4 Materials and Methods
An overview of
the structure- and ligand-based virtual screening
methodology applied in the present study is shown in Figure 7 and described in detail in
the sections below.

Figure 7 Overview of the applied computational methodology.

4.1 Search for 3D Structural Similarity
First, we analyzed the structural similarity of the NPs from essential
oils with the DEET crystallographic conformer using Screen3D (ChemAxon).58 A Tanimoto coefficient cutoff value of 0.7 was
applied as a measure of 3D similarity for selecting similar compounds
from the initial library with 1633 compounds from the EssOilDB.38 Screen3D automatically generated the 3D conformers;
thus, we limited the maximum number of conformers per compound to
4. The Tanimoto coefficient cutoff is defined by eq 1.59 1  Here, sA, B denotes the similarity between both compounds (A
and B), xJA means the jth features of compound A, xJB represents the jth features of
compound B, and xJAxJB is the feature present in
both analyzed compounds.

4.2 Pharmacophoric Prediction and Filtering
Next, we used the Pharmit server to screen the NP structures with
similar pharmacophoric groups and shape with the DEET conformer complexed
to AgamOBP1 (PDB: 3N7H, X-ray structure, resolution: 1.6 Å).60 We analyzed the superposition of the predicted
pharmacophores of the natural compound with two pharmacophoric models
of DEET complexed with the AgamOBP1 homodimer. Based
on these initial screenings, six compounds were selected for further
analysis.

4.3 Molecular Docking
The Molegro Virtual
Docker (MVD) program, which uses the evolutionary algorithm MolDock,61 was used to perform molecular docking simulations
to analyze the binding mode of the NPs complexed to the AgamOBP1 homodimer. First, to validate the docking protocol, redocking
simulations were performed with the DEET structure against the AgamOBP1 homodimer. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values
less than or equal to 1.0 Å were considered satisfactory for
replicating the ligand binding mode in the crystallographic structure.
Next, for the docking simulations, docking grids with radii of 8 to
15 Å, depending on the selected ligand, were positioned in the AgamOBP1 active site between both AgamOBP1
monomers using the spatial coordinates of crystallographic DEET as
a reference. Water molecules, ions, and the DEET structure were removed
from both OBP1 chains before the docking simulations. Then, we performed
the flexible docking protocol of MVD, which consider the flexibility
of the ligand and residue side chains.62 All poses obtained were ranked according to the best superposition
with the crystallographic structure of DEET and lower docking energy.

4.4 Molecular Dynamics Simulation and Analysis
of the AgamOBP1–Ligand Complexes
Using the Amber16 package,63 MD simulations
were performed for the following AgamOBP1 systems:
(1) AgamOBP1 unbound to the ligands (ligand-free),
(2) AgamOBP1 complexed with DEET (PDB: 3N7H), and (3) the six
selected NPs from essential oils. First, the partial atomic charges
of the ligands were determined using the restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) protocol64 through quantum
mechanical calculations carried out in the Gaussian 09 program.65 using the Hartree–Fock method66 with the 6-31G* basis set.67 The biomolecular systems were solvated in the tLeap module
using an octahedral truncated water box with TIP3P, an explicit solvation
model.68 The distance between the water
box wall and the atoms of the solvated system was set to 12 Å.
Na+ counterions were added to the water box to maintain
electroneutrality. The force fields ff14SB69 and General Amber Force Field70 were
used to parameterize the protein (AgamOBP1) and the
ligand structures (NPs and DEET), respectively. An energy minimization
protocol with six steps that included the steepest-descent and conjugated
gradient algorithm was performed for all systems. All hydrogen atoms,
water, and ions were minimized by 10,000 cycles for each step followed
by minimization of the whole AgamOBP1 system with
the progressive decrease of restraints. Next, the whole system was
heated through 10 heating steps. The first heating step was performed
at a constant volume for 20 ps, increasing the temperature to 100
K. From the second to the ninth step, 1 ns was used to raise the temperature
gradually from 100 to 275 K. In the 10th heating step, the temperature
reached 300 K, which was then maintained using 5 ns of MD simulation
to equilibrate the density at constant pressure (1 bar). The temperature
was maintained at 300 K by coupling to a Langevin thermostat using
a collision frequency of 2 ps–1, and the constant
isotropic pressure was maintained at 1 bar by using the Berendsen
barostat. All stages of the simulations employed a cutoff of 10 Å
for nonbonded interactions, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method
was used to compute the long-range electrostatic interactions. The
SHAKE algorithm was applied for all H bonds during MD simulation,
and the time step was set to 2 fs.71 Finally,
MD simulation was performed in 100 ns. The RMSD plot was obtained
for each system during the simulation using the heavy atoms of the
protein backbone. The noncovalent interactions of the receptor–ligand
complex were analyzed over 10 ns of MD simulation using PyContact72 and visually inspected using the Visual Molecular
Dynamics (VMD) program.73

4.5 Analysis of Conformational States over the
MD Simulation
To calculate the binding free energy and to
measure the molecular interactions between the ligands and AgamOBP1 binding pocket, we selected the intervals of the
MD trajectories based on the convergent conformational states of AgamOBP1–ligand complexes obtained during 100 ns
of MD simulation using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is
a transformation technique that converts a series of potentially coordinated
observations present in a covariance matrix, reducing the linear correlations
among them, thus transforming into a set of orthogonal vectors named
principal components (PCs).74 The first
component (PC1) maximizes the variance data in the data set and the
rest of the variance is represented by the second (PC2) and third
component (PC3), respectively. The PCA combined with MD simulations
of proteins has been widely applied to analyze the local and collective
movements of protein structures,75,76 to determine
the conformational changes that favor enzyme catalysis,77 to explore the functional roles of ion binding
in protein structure,78 and to sample the
convergence and correspondence between the protein structures over
the MD simulation.79 Our conformational
analyses were performed in the CPPTRAJ80 and Bio3D81 programs, and the scatter
plots were build using PC1 and PC2.

4.6 Binding Free Energy Calculations
To compute the binding free energy between the ligands (NPs and DEET)
and the AgamOBP1 structure, we selected three intervals
with 1000 frames from each MD trajectory. To calculate the binding
free energy, we applied the solvated interaction energy (SIE) method55 available in SIETRAJ.82 We also performed a ligand pairwise per-residue energy decomposition
analysis using the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area
(MM/GBSA) method83 available in Amber16.63

4.7 Analysis of the Chemical Space of Natural
Products from Essential Oils
To analyze the chemical space
of the filtered NPs obtained from essential oils, we compared them
with 18 approved or experimental repellents (Table S6) using PCA. Six physicochemical and structural descriptors
were used in PCA: number of rotatable bonds, c log P, molecular weight, number of H bond donors, H bond acceptors,
and number of aromatic rings. These descriptors have been applied
to determine the herbicide-, fungicide-, pesticide-, and insecticide-likeness
of compounds.84 All properties were calculated
using the Instant JChem suite.58
