Here, we investigate
the stoichiometry control of GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As droplet epitaxy (DE) quantum dots (QDs). Few tens
of core nonstoichiometries in the Ga(As) atomic percent are revealed
in as-grown “strain-free” QDs using state-of-the-art
atomic-scale energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy based on transmission
electron microscopy. Precise systematic analyses demonstrate a successful
quenching of the nonstoichiometry below 2%. The control of the chemical
reactions with well-controlled ex situ annealing sheds light on the
engineering of a novel single-photon source of strain-free DE QDs
free of defects.

Introduction
Self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots
(QDs) have gained much
attention due to their rich variety of nanotechnological applications
in photonic quantum technologies (e.g., information processing, cryptography,
and quantum teleportation),1−6 quantum simulators of chemical and physical systems,7 optoelectronics,8−14 and chemical15−17 or biosensing.18,19 Conventionally, three-dimensional
islands of Stranski–Krastanov (SK)-type QDs are formed on lattice-mismatched
heteroepitaxial systems driven by the elastic relaxation of strain.
Experiencing a substantial (intrinsic) strain field, the chemical
composition profiles of SK QDs unfortunately significantly modify
their optoelectronic properties, which is an obstacle to the integration
of QD single-photon sources in on-chip optical circuits. For decades,
droplet epitaxy (DE) has attracted attention as an alternative technique
for fabricating deterministic QD structural morphologies that are
free of strain.20−30 In the DE mode, liquid droplets of a metallic material (Ga) are
formed on a group-III-terminated surface, followed by crystallization
under the flux of a group-V element (As) (Figure 1a). While the structural morphology of QDs
can be precisely controlled by growth parameters, such as the substrate
temperature, the flux of As4, and the surface stoichiometry,
the DE technique enables the fabrication of “strain-free”
GaAs QDs on a lattice-matched AlGaAs matrix. Such controllability
(solely via the crystallization conditions) and the precedent characteristics
of DE QDs hold substantial promise for on-chip implementations of
QD single-photon sources.

scan (Figure 2) across
the center of the QD.

The presence of a small amount of defects in DE QDs, however,
can
strongly modify their optoelectronic properties and their chemi-physical
nature, drastically decreasing the efficiency of photon emitters.
Suffering from the low efficiency of optical emission in QD photoluminescence
(PL), many studies have reported improving the quality of DE QDs by
performing ex situ thermal treatments.22−24,26,27,29,31−33 The optimization of
the post-thermal process (relative to improving the crystallinity
of QDs) relies on phenomenological enhancements in the intensity of
the QD PL. Such analyses need to be put in structural and chemical
contexts that nanoscopic studies have been lacking.31−33 Atomic-resolution
systematic analyses of such DE QDs are therefore in high demand to
acquire a precise chemi-physical understanding to engineer defect-free
and strain-free QDs.

In this study, we thoroughly investigate
the nonstoichiometry in
GaAs DE QDs with and without post-thermal-induced recrystallization
processes. Precise structural and chemical investigations are systematically
performed for 40 individual QDs using atomically resolved transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).
Different degrees of nonstoichiometric cores are revealed in strain-free
QDs as a function of the post-thermal-induced recrystallization temperature.
While resolving a few to a few tens of compositional changes in the
atomic percent, near-unity stoichiometric QDs are acquired via a careful
post-thermal-induced recrystallization process. In addition, we examine
the Tex-an-dependent effect of
Al interdiffusion on the electronic structures of DE QDs via an envelope
function model. Defect-free and strain-free DE QDs of high optical
quality would ultimately lead to the on-chip implementation of QD
single-photon sources.

Results and Discussion
Control of Nonstoichiometry
in Strain-Free DE QDs
Because
the GaAs/AlGaAs DE QD system is known to be strain-free, the elemental
distribution of GaAs QDs and any chemical changes in a QD are primarily
of concern. To atomically resolve the structural and chemical characteristics
of strain-free GaAs DE QDs, TEM EDS is performed on cross-sectional
specimens with embedded GaAs islands (cf. Figure 1). For the pyramidal/conical shapes of the
GaAs DE QDs, atomic-scale analyses of the in-depth profiles reveal
a remarkable inhomogeneity in their chemical distributions (cf. Figure 1b,c). In particular,
an As-deficient (Ga-rich) QD is resolved in the EDS maps. Here, the
control parameters of the structural morphology include the surface
stoichiometry, the crystallization temperature, and the As4 flux.22 To resolve the two-dimensional
(2D) elemental distributions more precisely (with a high signal-to-noise
ratio), we also perform line scans of the chemical constituents across
the center of each QD along the growth axis (cf. Figure 2). A significant nonstoichiometry (∼7:3 in the Ga/As
atomic ratio) is revealed to be present at the core of as-grown DE
QDs. The primary mechanism responsible for metal-rich nonstoichiometric
QDs is the insufficient diffusion of As atoms into the Ga liquid droplets
(i.e., the Ga reservoirs) under the surface impinging density of As.22,27 The incomplete crystallization of GaAs DE QDs results in a gradient
of the As composition in the droplet leaving the nonstoichiometric
core. The As-deficient (Ga-rich) droplets are seen to turn into stoichiometric
QDs at an enhanced temperature in the post-thermal-induced recrystallization
process. The exemplary Ga depth profiles in Figure 2 show a remarkable improvement in the crystallinity
by a few tens of atomic percent for four distinct temperatures of
ex situ annealing.

Figure 2 Representative line composition profiles of Ga (green
open circles),
As (red circles), and Al (yellow diamonds) for specimens of as-grown
QDs and QDs with ex situ annealing at 750, 800, and 850 °C using
TEM EDS line scans. The atomic percentage of Al corresponds to the
top (yellow) axis, and those of Ga and As correspond to the bottom
axis.

To gain more systematic and profound
insights into this process,
we perform a statistical EDS of 40 individual QDs, 10 QDs for each
of the cases with and without post-thermal-induced recrystallization
treatments at various Tex-an. The
maximum deviations between Ga and As in the atomic percent (CGa–As) are displayed in Figure 3 for the four distinct treatments.
With no deliberate ex situ annealing treatment, the GaAs DE QDs present
a significant mean nonstoichiometry of 37% (CGa–As) with an atomic ratio of Ga/As ranging from 1.5
to 3.7 (CGa–As = 10.1–28.5).
Conversely, Keizer et al.34 reported an
X-ray scanning tunneling microscopy (X-STM) analysis of as-grown DE
QDs with no recognizable nonstoichiometry. While the X-STM probes
the surface characteristics at the atomic scale, the additional capability
of TEM EDS identifies the elemental compositions by measuring the
energies of the characteristic X-ray peaks. At the same time, CGa–As is measured as varying from ∼20
to ∼58% in a given specimen (cf. Figure 3). The measured PL signals of as-grown QDs31,32 seem to arise relative to QDs with a low degree of nonstoichiometry.
A nearly identical trend is seen in the elemental profiles of GaAs
DE QDs with thermal treatment at 750 °C, even though the observed
nonstoichiometry ratios fall in a smaller variance from 1.9 to 3.1. CGa–As is seen to diminish by more than
16% with an increase of 50 °C in Tex-an from 750 °C. Encouragingly, a few tens of the still existing
core nonstoichiometry are dramatically quenched below ∼4% for
GaAs DE QDs post-thermal recrystallized at 850 °C. The average
standard deviation of CGa–As is
extracted to 1.6% for DE QDs annealed at 850 °C. Here, the overall
analytical accuracy of EDS analysis is approximately 2% (see details
in Experimental Section and Computational Methods). Further reaction of the As atoms, therefore, eliminates the As
composition gradient within the dot. Such recrystallization processes
can be understood as reordering the As and Ga atoms dissolved within
the GaAs DE QD. The diffusion coefficient of As (e.g., 5.8 ×
10–14 at 850 °C) has been estimated to be too
low to permit bulk equilibrium via vacancy diffusion from the surface
at the annealing temperatures.35 Accordingly,
the local rearrangement of defects has been identified as a viable
mechanism for producing uniformity during post-growth annealing.35,36 The localized dissolution of As atoms from the substrate would create
nonstoichiometric defects, whereas near-stoichiometry in GaAs is observed
at the bottom of the QDs (cf. Figure 1). Remnants of metallic Ga within the GaAs DE QDs have
also been reported by Mano et al.37 We
note that individual phases of Ga and GaAs have been resolved to coexist
within the GaAs nanostructures with no post-thermal treatment. The
in situ annealing process seems to induce the nonstoichiometric phases
of Ga and As for our as-grown DE QDs. Compared to the ambiguous optimization
processes of post-thermal annealing (relying on the phenomenological
enhancements in the QD PL intensity), the EDS statistics reveal a
dramatic recovery of the crystallinity in 50 °C from 800 °C
(cf. Figure 3). We
note that the operating temperature of rapid thermal annealing (RTA)
is measurement-based (i.e., based on the position of the temperature
sensor and the Ar environment), and therefore no absolute value is
given. For example, Bocquel et al.27 performed
post-thermal annealing at 750 °C to complete the crystallization.
Three-dimensional composition profiles of DE QDs have also been retrieved
using atomic probe tomography (APT) across a volume of several tens
of nanometers. The TEM EDS employed in this study facilitates the
comparative statistical analysis by scanning a sample cross section
of 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of APT. Here, our methodology
shows how strain-free but nonstoichiometric QDs are converted into
stoichiometric DE QDs at well-controlled temperatures of ex situ annealing.
This provides powerful new insights into the engineering of strain-free
QDs with unity stoichiometry.

Figure 3 Chemically and spatially resolved ratios of
the nonstoichiometry
are summarized as a function of the ex situ annealing temperature. CGa–As denotes the maximum deviation between
Ga and As in the atomic percent, and Tex-an the temperature of the ex situ annealing. The individual solid dots
represent the mean values of the corresponding CGa–As of 10 QDs under a given ex situ annealing temperature.

Interdiffusion of Detrimental
Al Atoms in Strain-Free QDs
Along with the control of the
nonstoichiometry, the interdiffusion
of detrimental Al is also a critical issue in DE QDs,27,29,31,32 and disturbs the optoelectronic properties of single-photon emitters.
We carefully examine whether the ex situ annealing process degrades
the purity of the strain-free DE QDs. Figure 2 confirms a low level of Al intermixing for
most of the QDs. Limited by the inevitable position drift and damage
of the thin samples, the average Al elemental profiles of the EDS
line scans level off at 4% in the central regions of QDs with widths
of 2 nm. We note that ∼11.4% of the average Al composition
was retrieved with an average deviation of ∼0.4% on the host
material of Al0.3Ga0.7As for a scanning strip
with a width of ∼20 nm. The Al defects underneath the QDs originate
from the recrystallization of Al atoms, which dissolve into the Ga
droplet.27,29 Meanwhile, the local enrichment of Al at
the top facet is ascribed to the different mobilities of Ga and Al
atoms. We also examine the influence of Al interdiffusion in the electronic
structures of DE QDs employing the envelope function scheme within
the k·p theory (see details
in Experimental Section and Computational Methods). The sub-band energies EsubC/V in the conduction/valence band and
the direct Coulomb interaction energy J of an electron–hole
pair are evaluated for lens-shaped QDs. The average radius of the
DE QDs is taken to be 15 nm, and the average heights are found to
be 5.5, 7.7, 7.5, and 8.9 nm for the as-grown QD and the QDs post-annealed
at 750, 800, and 850 °C, respectively. The results of EsubC/V and J for the ground sub-bands are summarized in Table 1 for various temperatures
of post-thermal-induced recrystallization. EsubC/V(□)
and J(□) denote the results of an ideal confinement
potential in the absence of Al interdiffusion. To configure a more
realistic profile of band gap, the experimental mole fraction x(zQD) of the Al acquired in
EDS is applied to an empirical band gap38 of EAlxGa(1–x)As(zQD) = 1.519 + 1.155x + 0.37x2. Here, zQD denotes the position
measured from the bottom to the top facet along the growth axis of
a QD. Our analysis shows that due to the interdiffusion of Al within
the QDs, the QD recombination energy is modified by ∼1.7% for
the as-grown sample. The QD excitonic energy is reduced by ∼2.7%
via the post-thermal-induced recrystallization treatment up to 850
°C (see theoretical details in Experimental
Section and Computational Methods). The interdiffusion effect
on the band gap via x(zQD) yields ∼46.4% of the quantum confinement correction (i.e.,
the sum of the excitonic sub-band energy and the Coulomb interaction
of Esub + J) for the
annealed samples, while it yields ∼32% of the quantum confinement
correction for as-grown QDs. In our calculation, a finite Tex-an treatment gives rise to a minor
change of ±0.2% in Esub + J for the specimens treated at the three distinct temperatures.
Therefore, we demonstrate that the optimal post-thermal-induced recrystallization
process quenches the detrimental core nonstoichiometry of strain-free
DE QDs. The Tex-an-dependent degradation
of the QD purity by Al is believed to be minor.

Conclusions
We have systematically
demonstrated full control of the detrimental
nonstoichiometric defects in strain-free DE QDs by employing a post-thermal-induced
recrystallization process. Harnessing unambiguous high-resolution
TEM EDS, the nonstoichiometries present in the core of strain-free
DE QDs have been quantitatively revealed. Chemically and spatially
resolved complexes of as-grown DE QDs have an average nonstoichiometry
of 6.85:3.15 (Ga/As) in the atomic percent. Using statistical analyses
of TEM EDS for 40 individual DE QDs, we have demonstrated a successful
approach to eliminate the core nonstoichiometry via a careful ex situ
annealing process. At the threshold temperature, a near-unity stoichiometry
has been attained in our strain-free QDs within the analytical accuracy
of EDS. The effect of Al interdiffusion (versus the treatment temperature)
on the quantum confinement characteristics is believed to be minor.
In addition to shedding light on the Tex-an-dependent nanoscopic machinery, this novel engineering of strain-free
QDs with unity stoichiometry is critical for the practical on-chip
implementation of QD single-photon sources.

Experimental Section and
Computational Methods
Fabrication of GaAs DE QDs
The GaAs
QDs under investigation
were grown by DE using molecular beam epitaxy.21−23 As illustrated
in Figure 1, the epitaxial
growth of GaAs QDs in the DE mode is based on the crystallization
of Ga droplets via the injection of an As4 flux. The crystallized
GaAs QDs are then capped with an AlGaAs protective layer. To form
the Ga droplet, the partial pressure of As (PAs) in the chamber was maintained below ∼2 × 10–12 Torr prior to the injection of the Ga flux. We fabricated
the Ga liquid droplets on an Al0.3Ga0.7As/GaAs
substrate by supplying two monolayers of Ga at T ∼
220 °C. The growth chamber background pressure was below 10–10 Torr during the injection of the Ga atoms. As depicted
in Figure 1a, the As
atoms were subsequently supplied to impinge on a Ga-terminated (Ga-rich)
surface with the reconstruction of (4 × 6)22 under a moderate As4 beam equivalent pressure
(BEP) of 1.0 × 10–5 Torr. The morphological
reconstruction of the DE droplet involves the migration, accumulation,
and desorption of Ga on the (4 × 6) Ga-rich surface (diffusion-stopping
processes).22 After the crystallization
time of 60 s, the GaAs DE QDs were thermally annealed at an increased
substrate temperature of ∼560 °C (high temperature) with
a reduced As4 BEP of 6.0 × 10–6 Torr.
While controlling the shapes of nanostructures with higher thermal
stability, we maintained the crystallization process of GaAs droplets
for 720 s. We note that the migration of the Ga droplet is regulated
with the control of the substrate temperature and the surface impinging
density. The GaAs DE QDs were then protected with a 20 nm-thick Al0.3Ga0.7As layer at 560 °C. The average QD
density of ∼3/μm2 was obtained by measuring
the images of a charge-coupled device for optically excited samples.
A detailed description of the growth mechanism and parameters can
be found in our previous works.22,23 We note that the structural
morphology and optical characteristics have also been reported for
the similar type of DE QDs.24

Ex Situ Thermal
Annealing Process
For systematic control
of the stoichiometry of DE QDs, post-growth RTA processes were performed
on as-grown QDs as a function of temperature in a standard RTA equipment.
Each specimen was heated up to 750, 800, and 850 °C within 60
s and maintained for 240 s in ambient Ar. Then, the sample was cooled
below 100 °C over 15 min. The cycling of ex situ RTA is optimized
based on the phenomenological enhancement of PL intensity.23,31 We note that previous studies have shown a decrease of PL intensity
for DE QDs post-annealed above 850 °C.

TEM and EDS Analyses
The high-resolution structural
analysis was performed by employing a Titan 80-300 TEM operating at
300 kV. We used focused ion beam (FIB) techniques for the preparation
of specimens, in which QD droplets are randomly embedded. To resolve
structural profiles of all constituents in DE QDs precisely, chemical
characterization with compositional mapping was carried out using
a Talos F200X of 200 kV. The EDS elemental maps and line scans were
measured in FIB-prepared cross-sectional specimens with a thickness
of less than 50 nm. While 50% of the As concentration is theoretically
estimated in the matrix of Al0.3Ga0.7As, the
average concentration profiles of As were measured to be 52.3% with
a standard deviation error of 1.8% for a scanning strip with a width
of 20 nm. The 2D mapping could include an incorrect distribution of
elements due to the unavoidable spatial drift and damage of thin samples
during several minutes of data collection time. For statistical analyses
of 40 individual QDs, we performed the EDS line scans for a faster
elemental mapping to increase the contrast of elemental distributions.
Given the point resolution of 1.6 Å in scanning transmission
electron microscope mode, the in-depth concentration profiles of DE
QDs were seen by scanning across the center of the QDs in the growth
direction [001]. The TEM EDS maps and line scan profiles in Figures 1 and 2 probe small compositional changes of Ga, As, and Al in the
DE QDs post-annealed at distinct temperatures.

Calculation of QD Quantum
Confinement Energies
We consider
a lens-shaped DE QD of GaAs/Al0.3Ga0.7As with
in-plane cylindrical symmetry, whose base length and height are extracted
from the cross-sectional TEM images. We employ the envelope function
scheme based on the k·p theory
to calculate the quantum confinement characteristics of DE QDs.39 The excitonic recombination energy EX of QD is given by the sum of the fundamental band gap Egap of QD, the sub-band confinement energies Esub of carriers, and the electron–hole
Coulomb interaction energy J: EX = Egap + Esub + J. The latter two terms (i.e., Esub and J) in EX describe the quantum confinement characteristics of
an electron–hole system. The QD sub-band energies and wavefunctions
are calculated by numerically solving a Schrödinger equation
written as  To conform realistic quantum
confinement potentials
inside the DE QDs, the empirical distributions of Al in the atomic
percent are least-squares-fitted with a polynomial function of degrees
up to seven and converted into the position-dependent mole fraction
of x(zQD). We apply the
experimental x(zQD) to
an empirical gap formula38 of EAlxGa(1–x)As(zQD) = 1.519 + 1.155x + 0.37x2. The conduction band
offset is taken to be 60% of the band gap difference.40,41 The direct Coulomb energy J projected onto an exciton
state |ψeψh⟩ is written as42, where the
Coulomb interaction is screened
by the local dielectric function ϵ(|r – r′|) for a given position r with spin
σ. The material parameters used in the calculation can be found
in refs (38−40).
