Layered
double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles (NPs) are safe and
effective vectors for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery. However,
it is unclear whether there are optimal parameters for the efficient
delivery of functional siRNA using LDH NPs. In this research, we comprehensively
examined the effect of parameters, such as the mixing method and LDH/siRNA
mass ratio on siRNA silencing capability. We first noted that the
best way for loading gene segments (25 bp dsDNA and siRNA) is to add
gene molecules to 100 nm LDH and then diluting in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium. Very interestingly, the optimal LDH/gene
mass ratio is around 20:1 in terms of cellular uptake amount of gene
segments, whereas this ratio is shifted to around 5:1 in terms of
target gene silencing efficacy, which has been reasonably explained.
The optimization for LDH NP-based gene delivery system may provide
the guidance for more efficient in vitro and in vivo siRNA delivery
using the optimal parameters.

1 Introduction
Layered double hydroxide
(LDH) is a group of anionic clay materials
that have attracted increasing attention in recent years for biomedical
applications, such as gene delivery, vaccine delivery, and drug delivery.1−3 LDH materials have several unique features, including anionic exchange
capacity,4 and the ability to capture organic
and inorganic anions.5−7 MgAl-LDH nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively
investigated as vehicles for delivery of genes and drugs to cells,8−11 which are biocompatible, have a high loading capacity, facilitate
cellular uptake, and release target biomolecules in a pH-dependent
manner.12 Moreover, the inherent surface
positive charge and anion exchange property enable MgAl-LDH NPs to
carry and deliver anionic biomolecules and pharmaceutical drugs such
as oligonucleotides,13 DNAs,14,15 RNAs,10,14 methotrexate,16 5-fluorouracil,13 and anti-inflammatory
drugs (diclofenac, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, and naproxen).11 Recent studies have demonstrated the capacity
of LDH NPs to target specific cells15 or
subcellular compartments.1 More advantages
of LDH NPs as delivery vehicles include the low toxicity, protection
of payloads, and high cellular delivery efficacy.17,18 These properties indicate that LDH NPs are a good cellular delivery
system for biomolecules such as DNAs or RNAs.

RNA interference
(RNAi) is a biological mechanism, in which small
interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA destroys targeted messenger RNA
(mRNA) to suppress specific gene expression.19−21 Because of
its preciseness and effectiveness, RNAi has proven to be a promising
measure for the treatment of cancer.22−25 However, some impediments hinder
its further clinical use, such as low cellular uptake and instability
of RNA molecules, under physiological conditions. Thus, it is necessary
to devise an efficient gene delivery system for RNAi molecules to
enter tumor cells to elicit gene modification effects.26−29

Mg2Al–Cl-LDH nanomaterials have shown great
potential
to be an efficient delivery system for RNA molecules in RNAi-based
treatment of cancers, as reported elsewhere.13,14,30,31 However, it
is not clear whether the parameters applied to formulate the LDH/siRNA
hybrid system are optimal as there is no such report about the parameter
optimization for this system.

Therefore, the objectives of this
research were to: (1) examine
the effect of LDH NP/siRNA mixing method on the siRNA uptake by MCF-7
cells; (2) investigate the effects of the LDH NP/siRNA mass ratio
on the cellular uptake and the target gene knockdown efficacy; and
(3) confirm the delivery efficacy of siRNA in terms of target mRNA
silence and target protein expression reduction using the optimized
parameters. Our findings in this research suggest a set of optimal
parameters for efficient siRNA delivery using LDH NPs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physicochemical Features
of LDH NPs
Analysis of homogeneously dispersed Mg2Al–Cl-LDH
suspension gave a narrow particle size distribution (Figure 1A). The equivalent mean hydrodynamic
diameter was 110 nm with the polydispersity index of 0.099; most particles
were distributed within a range of 50–200 nm, and the suspension
was transparent. Consistent with previous reports,32−34 Mg2Al–Cl-LDH NPs had an average zeta potential of ∼40
mV in suspension. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image
(Figure 1B) shows that
the LDH crystallites were well-crystallized with a typical hexagonally
shaped morphology, as reported previously.32,34 The lateral length of the crystallites was in the range of 60–160
nm, corresponding to the hydrodynamic diameter of most LDH NPs measured
by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), indicating that LDH NPs
were individually dispersed in aqueous solution.

NPs: (A) particle size distribution of
Mg2Al–Cl-LDH NPs in suspension; (B) TEM image; (C)
FTIR spectrum; and (D) XRD pattern of Mg2Al–Cl-LDH
NPs.

The layered structure of as-prepared
LDH NPs is confirmed by the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1C) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrum (Figure 1D).
The FTIR spectrum is typical of Mg2Al–Cl-LDH material,
as featured by a broad band at 3473 cm–1 (νOH), a peak at 1629 cm–1 (δH2O), and a broad band at 627 and 415 cm–1 (due to M–O vibrations and M–O–H bending, respectively).
According to the XRD pattern of Mg2Al–Cl-LDH NPs,
this LDH had a basal spacing of 0.781 nm. Taking into account that
the thickness of the LDH hydroxide layer is 0.48 nm, the interlayer
spacing is 0.31 nm, similar with the size of the chloride ion.32 These data indicate that LDH NPs prepared in
this study possess the typical physicochemical properties, as reported
previously.8,35,36

2.2 Optimization of the Mixing Method and the
Culture Time
Three mixing methods were designed to load siRNA/double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) onto LDH NPs. siRNA was mimicked by dsDNA-Cy3, and the
loading efficiency of each mixing method was quantified by the cellular
uptake amount of dsDNA-Cy3-loaded LDH NPs, which was measured in terms
of the average cell fluorescence intensity by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS). After LDH/dsDNA hybrids were obtained in one
mixing method, they were added in the culture medium for MCF-7 cells
to take up for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and fixed for FACS analysis.
In each test, the fluorescence intensity of cells from group mixing
method 3 (MM 3) was adjusted as 100% and compared with that from the
other two groups, as shown in Figure 2. The conclusion is that MM3 exhibits the highest uptake
efficiency for the siRNA/dsDNA delivery to MCF-7 cells. This optimal
mixing method was employed in the following experiments.

Figure 2 Optimization
of the mixing method. dsDNA was loaded to LDH NPs
in MM 1, 2, and 3 at LDH/dsDNA mass ratio = 20:1. Then, the mixture
was added into the medium for MCF-7 uptake. The uptake amount was
measured in terms of the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) by FACS.
Data presented as the mean ± SE from three independent experiments.

The mixing method affects the
LDH/dsDNA delivery efficacy probably
through changing the aggregation of LDH NPs when mixing with cell
culture medium. As reported previously, the aggregation is concentration-
and size-dependent,35 happening through
shortening the van del Walls thickness of electron double layers on
the LDH NP surface and serum protein bridging effect.37 When LDH is premixed with the medium [mixing method 1 (MM1)
and mixing method 2 (MM2)], the surface of LDH NPs is partly occupied
with serum proteins and the electron double-layer thickness on the
LDH NP surface is decreased by the salt ions, which may induce aggregation
of LDH NPs.37 Further, phosphate anions
in the medium are also adsorbed on the LDH NP surface, which may significantly
reduce the dsDNA loading onto LDH NPs via anion exchange. Both aggregation
and less exchange liability may result in some free dsDNA and thus
less cellular uptake. When dsDNA is first loaded onto LDH NPs via
surface adsorption and interlayer intercalation of dsDNA,38 dsDNA is all adsorbed onto the LDH particle
surface. The surface loading normally results in LDH/dsDNA aggregates,37 which may be then better dispersed in culture
medium, leading to an increased cellular uptake.

Figure 3 Cellular uptake profile
of LDH/dsDNA hybrids represented by the
positive cell percentage vs culture time. LDH/dsDNA = 20:1, [LDH]
= 20.8 μg/mL, and [dsDNA-Cy3] = 80 nM.

To optimize the cellular uptake time, MCF-7 cells were treated
with LDH/dsDNA-Cy3 (MM3, LDH/dsDNA = 20:1) and harvested for FACS
analysis at different time points to assess the Cy3-positive cell
percentage. As shown in Figure 3, a robust uptake of LDH/dsDNA hybrids was observed during
the first hour. After LDH/dsDNA treatment for 4 h, vast majority of
MCF-7 cells (>80%) were positive. Extending the culture time to
8
h seemed not to obviously increase the positive cell percentage, as
reported previously.35 Thus, 4 h appears
to be the optimal culture time.

2.3 Optimization
of the LDH/dsDNA Mass Ratio for
Cellular Uptake
For optimization of the LDH/dsDNA mass ratio
for gene delivery, dsDNA (25 bp) was immobilized with LDH NPs at different
mass ratios. From the imaging, dsDNA was completely immobilized by
LDH NPs when LDH/dsDNA was 20:1 or 40:1 (Figure 4A). At 10:1, most dsDNA was loaded onto LDH,
whereas considerable dsDNA was free at 5:1 to 1:1. For comparison,
the MFI of cells treated with LDH/dsDNA hybrids at the mass ratio
of 20:1 was set at 100%. The MFI from other groups was then compared
to give a relative MFI. Clearly, MCF-7 cells took up most of the dsDNA
via LDH NPs at the mass ratio between 15:1 and 25:1 (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 (A) Agarose gel electrophoresis
for examining the immobilization
of dsDNA by LDH NPs at the mass ratio from 40:1 to 1:1. (B) Relative
cellular uptake amount of dsDNA represented by the relative MFI of
MCF-7 cells vs the LDH/dsDNA mass ratio at [dsRNA-Cy3] = 80 nM = 1.04
μg/mL.

The relationship between
the mass ratio and cellular uptake rate
probably results from the trade-off between the dsDNA amount per LDH
NP and the concentration of LDH NP number. Because almost all dsDNA-Cy3
is loaded onto LDH NPs at the mass ratio of 15:1 and above (Figure 4A), dsDNA-Cy3 is
all adsorbed onto LDH NPs in the mass ratio range indicated in Figure 5B,C, and the dsDNA
amount per LDH NP is linearly dependent on the LDH/dsDNA mass ratio.
In the mass ratio range in Figure 5A, the maximum dsDNA amount per LDH NP may be achieved
at the mass ratio of 10:1 to 2:1 and may be nearly constant, so there
is an essential amount of free dsDNA-Cy3 at the mass ratio of 5:1
to 2:1. As also pointed out in previous studies,35,39,40 the cellular uptake efficiency of LDH NPs
is almost linearly dependent on the LDH concentration under 20 μg/mL
(∼1.0 × 1010 number/mL) and reached a plateau
beyond this critical concentration. In the current research, the critical
concentration occurs at the LDH/dsDNA mass ratio of around 20:1. Therefore,
the dsDNA cellular uptake is monotonically reduced with the mass ratio
from 20:1 to 80:1 (Figure 4B) as the LDH NP number taken up by the cells is similar but
the dsDNA amount per LDH NP is decreased with the mass ratio from
20:1 to 80:1. With the mass ratio changing from 20:1 to 10:1, the
LDH NP number taken up by the cells is decreased but the dsDNA amount
per LDH NP is increased. It seems that the former is predominant over
the latter so that the dsDNA uptake is decreased overall (Figure 4B). Obviously, the
dsDNA amount per LDH NP is maximized in the mass ratio of 10:1 to
2:1, whereas the LDH NP number concentration is decreased linearly;
thus, the cellular uptake of dsDNA is reduced accordingly (Figure 4B). It should be
mentioned that the aggregation state of LDH/dsDNA hybrids may be slightly
varied at different mass ratios as the particle size of these aggregates
was mainly distributed in the range of 100–1000 nm in the culture
medium.37 We believe that the aggregation
state does not significantly affect the dsDNA transfection to MCF-7
cells.

Figure 5 Scheme illustration of the dsRNA loading amount per LDH NPs and
the relative LDH NP number at varied LDH/dsDNA mass ratios. (A) At
2:1 to 10:1, LDH NPs have the maximum dsDNA loading with some free
dsDNA; (B) at 15:1 to 30:1, LDH NPs have the maximum dsDNA loading
without free dsDNA; and (C) at 40:1 to 160:1, each LDH NP loads fewer
dsDNA molecules without free dsDNA.

Therefore, it appears that the optimal LDH/dsDNA mass ratio
is
around 20:1 in terms of the cellular uptake amount of dsDNA-Cy3 at
the dsDNA concentration of 80 nM in the culture medium.

2.4 Optimized Functional siRNA Delivery to MCF-7
To verify
the feasibility of optimized siRNA delivery system, MCF-7
cells were transfected with cell death siRNA (CD-siRNA) at different
LDH/siRNA mass ratios ranging from 1:1 to 40:1. MCF-7 cells were incubated
with LDH/CD-siRNA for 4 h and followed by incubation for 72 h in standard
culture medium. As shown in Figure 6, the MCF-7 cell viability was decreased by approximately
45–60% at a mass ratio of 5:1 with the CD-siRNA concentration
from 40 to 160 nM. This decrease of cell viability is much more than
that at the mass ratio of 20:1 (5–12%), 10:1 (8–17%),
2:1 (32–42%), and 1:1 (22–33%) under the same conditions,
respectively. This observation indicates that the optimal LDH/siRNA
mass ratio is around 5:1 in terms of CD-siRNA inhibition efficacy
of cancer cells, which is much different from that (20:1) in terms
of just cellular uptake by or delivery to MCF-7 cells (Figure 4B).

Figure 6 Cell viability of MCF-7
transfected with CD-siRNA delivered by
LDH NPs under various conditions. Data presented as the mean ±
SE from three independent experiments.

The shift of the optimal mass ratio from 20:1 for just cellular
uptake to 5:1 for functional siRNA to take effect may be further related
to the siRNA release from LDH/siRNA hybrids to the cytosol so as to
target and dice specific mRNA. The siRNA release from LDH/siRNA hybrids
may occur via two processes, that is, dissolution of LDH NPs and anion
exchange. As revealed previously,35,41 cellular internalization
of LDH NPs is basically driven by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. During
endocytosis, a certain amount of LDH NPs is acidified in the endosome
(pH 5–6) to be dissolved and release siRNA molecules, which
may also occur in the cytosol (pH 7.4) at a much slower pace after
LDH/siRNA hybrids escape from the endosome. As the dissolved LDH NP
amount would be very similar for each cell in a similar time scale,
thus LDH NP with the maximum siRNA loading would free most siRNA molecules
for complexing with RNA-induced silencing complex and dicing the target
mRNA. In comparison, double amount of LDH NPs would be taken up by
MCF-7 cells at 10:1 as at 5:1; thus, only half amount of free siRNA
would be released to the MCF-7 cytosol at 10:1 as at 5:1 and would
result in lower inhibition on cell viability. At the mass ratio of
20:1 to 80:1, the release of siRNA is even more difficult, leading
to much lower inhibition of tumor cell growth (Figure 6). In contrast, less than half amount of
LDH NPs would be taken up by MCF-7 cells at 2:1 as at 5:1 (LDH NP
number at 2:1 was about 40% at 5:1 when siRNA was fixed at 40, 80,
or 160 nM); thus, less than half amount of siRNA may be released to
MCF-7 cytosol at 2:1 as at 5:1 (supposed the siRNA loading per LDH
NP is maximum and the same), resulting in much lower cell growth inhibition.
In addition, few siRNA molecules on the LDH surface would be exchanged
with cytosol anions (Cl– and phosphates) and become
free, but this would contribute limitedly to the cell viability.

Therefore, the optimal LDH/siRNA mass ratio seems to be 5:1 for
functional siRNA delivery as the result of trading-off of these several
processes, that is, the loading amount of dsDNA/siRNA per LDH particle,
the number of LDH particles, and the suitable release rate of dsDNA/siRNA.
Comparatively, we used an LDH/siRNA mass ratio of 1:1 for siRNA delivery
to neuron and NIH3T3 cells in our previous research studies,10,42 which may underlie the delivery capacity of LDH NPs. On the other
hand, using the mass ratio of 40:1 for cellular uptake of siRNA35 is not optimal either. Similarly, varied mass
ratios (10:1 to 40:1) were used to deliver CD-siRNA to kill cancer
cells in combination with 5-FU,13 which
may not maximize the biological function of CD-siRNA in killing cancer
cells.

As a feasibility test, the optimized parameters for functional
siRNA delivery were used to formulate LDH/PD-L1-siRNA at the concentration
of 40, 80, and 160 nM with the LDH/siRNA mass ratio of 5:1, which
was used to treat MCF-7 for target gene silence. As shown in Figure 7, the delivered PD-L1
siRNA efficiently silenced PD-L1 mRNA expression (20–80%) and
PD-L1 expression (30–75%).

knockdown of PD-L1 mRNAs and (B) western blot showing reduction of
PD-L1 expression in MCF-7 treated with LDH/PD-L1-siRNA at the concentration
from 40 to 160 nM.

Therefore, this research
has optimized and confirmed the LDH NP
system for efficient in vitro delivery of genes to cancer cells, which
is believed to be also applicable for the in vivo delivery for cancer
gene therapy.43,44

3 Conclusions
In this work, the mixing method, cellular uptake time, and LDH/siRNA
mass ratio were optimized for functional siRNA delivery to cancer
cells. We found that the optimal mixing method was to directly add
siRNA into the LDH suspension, followed by a dilution with culture
medium, and the optimal cellular uptake time was 4 h, with >80%
cells
being transfected. In the mass ratio optimization, MCF-7 cells seem
to take up the greatest number of dsDNA or siRNA at the LDH/gene mass
ratio of 20:1. However, most functional CD-siRNA and PD-L1 siRNA seem
to avail and work the best at the mass ratio of around 5:1. Therefore,
this research has thus optimized the LDH-based platform for gene delivery
in vitro as well as in vivo.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Reagents
All samples
were prepared under sterile conditions. Sodium hydroxide pellets,
magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O), and aluminum chloride hexahydrated (AlCl3·6H2O) were purchased from Ajax Finechem, and Sigma-Aldrich Pty
Ltd, respectively. dsDNA-Cy3 was purchased from GeneWorks. CD-siRNA
was purchased from QIAGEN Pty. Ltd. PD-L1 siRNA (sense: 5′-AGAcGuAAGcAGuGuuGAAdTsdT-3′
and antisense: 5′-UUcAAcACUGCUuACGUCUdTsdT-3′) and other
chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich if not illustrated
specifically. Water used in experiments was deionized Milli-Q water.

4.2 LDH Preparation
Mg2Al–Cl-LDH
NPs were synthesized by coprecipitation-hydrothermal method, which
was well established in our group.8 Briefly,
a mixture of MgCl2 (0.70 M) and AlCl3 (0.30
M) with a total volume of 10 mL was quickly added to 40 mL of NaOH
solution (0.45 M) within 5 s, under vigorous stirring. After 10 min
of stirring, the slurry was separated via centrifugation and redispersed
in 40 mL of deionized water. The resultant suspension was moved into
a stainless steel autoclave with a Teflon lining and heated at 100
°C for 16 h. The final mass concentration of LDH in the obtained
transparent suspensions was approximately 10 mg/mL, with the yield
of ∼60%.

4.3 Characterization of LDH
The particle
size distribution of as-prepared LDH NPs was determined by PCS (Nanosizer
Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments) using noninvasive backscatter optics.
For TEM imaging, LDH solution was air-dried on a copper grid. The
images were obtained on a JEOL 1010A transmission electron microscope
at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. FTIR (PerkinElmer 1760X FTIR)
spectrum and XRD (Siemens F-series diffractometer with Cu Kα
radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm) pattern were collected to confirm
the layered structure of LDH NPs.

4.4 Cell
Culture
MCF-7, a widely studied
epithelial cancer cell line derived from breast adenocarcinoma, was
used as the cancer cell model in this study. Normally, MCF-7 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented by 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C
in 5% CO2 atmosphere.

4.5 Optimization
of the siRNA Delivery with LDH
NPs
LDH NPs were used to load siRNA-mimicking dsDNA-Cy3 using
different parameters. The delivery efficiency was evaluated by FACS,
which was used to decide the optimal parameters.

For mixing
method optimization, we designed three different methods. In MM 1,
both dsDNA and LDH suspension (LDH/dsDNA mass ratio was 20:1) were
diluted with DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 15 min incubation at room
temperature, diluted dsDNA was added to the diluted LDH suspension,
and the mixture was left at room temperature for another 15 min. In
MM 2, only the LDH suspension was diluted in the medium before mixing
with dsDNA, whereas in MM 3, dsDNA was directly added into the LDH
suspension, and then the mixture was diluted to the designed volume.
The obtained mixture (at the nominal dsDNA-Cy3 concentration of 80
nM) was added to MCF-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h (1 ×
105 cells per well) and then kept for 4 h. The cells were
harvested and fixed for FACS analysis afterwards.

To define
the optimal LDH/siRNA mass ratio for transfection, an
appropriate dose of dsDNA was mixed with different amounts of LDH
in suspension with LDH/dsDNA mass ratios ranging from 2:1 to 160:1,
using MM 3 as mentioned above. After adding the mixture, the cells
were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 4 h and then
collected for FACS analysis.

To determine the proper culture
time, MCF-7 cells treated with
LDH/dsDNA-Cy3 were placed in an atmosphere of 37 °C with 5% CO2. At different time points (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h),
cells were collected for FACS analysis.

4.6 FACS
Analysis
FACS analysis was performed
in a BD Accuri C6 (San Jose, CA, USA) flow cytometer with CFlow Sampler
software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, USA).

4.7 Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability
was assessed by a colorimetric assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were cultured in 96-well plates
(2.5 × 103 cells per well) and treated with LDH/CD-siRNA
at the concentration ranging from 40 to 160 nM. After 24 h, DMEM was
supplemented with 20 μL of MTT reagent (0.5 mg/mL) to each well
and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, MTT solution was
removed. After addition of 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
the plate was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C to dissolve the formazan
crystals. Absorbance readings of DMSO extracts were performed at 570
nm with reference to those at 650 nm using the plate reader.

4.8 Knockdown of PD-L1 Gene in MCF-7 with siRNA
PD-L1 siRNA
(sense: 5′-AGAcGuAAGcAGuGuuGAAdTsdT-3′
and antisense: 5′-UUcAAcACUGCUuACGUCUdTsdT-3′) was used
in this study. For MCF-7 cells, 1 × 105 cells/well
were seeded in a 6-well plate and cultured at 37 °C for 4 h in
the presence of LDH/PD-L1-siRNA that was formulated using optimal
parameters. The culture medium was then replaced with the fresh medium,
and transfected MCF-7 cells were cultured for another 72 h at 37 °C,
5% CO2. PD-L1 mRNA and protein level were examined by real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting, respectively.

4.9 Real-Time PCR
Real-time PCR assays
were carried out according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly,
1.2 mL of trizol/chloroform (1:5, v/v) was mixed with lyse cells and
the supernatant was collected by centrifugation (12 500 rpm,
15 min). Subsequently, 2.4 mL of isopropanol was added, followed by
centrifugating the supernatant for another 15 min at 12 500 rpm. The
pellet was collected and washed by 70% ethanol once. The pellet was
resuspended in 50 μL of H2O after drying and diluted
with 80 μL of H2O. For each well, 3.5 μL of
pellet solution was mixed with 8.5 μL of PCR Master Mixture
solution. Real-time PCR was conducted after centrifugation.

4.10 Western Blotting
The relative PD-L1
concentration in cell lysates was estimated using the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). The samples (roughly 10 μg total
protein per well) were mixed with protein-loading buffer (Bio-Rad)
containing 2-mercaptoethanol. After denaturation by 5 min boiling,
the samples were loaded on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX precast gels
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The gels were
blotted onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membranes for 90 min
@ 80 V; proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and blocked
for nonspecific binding with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST)
[0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in TBS pH 7.4] plus 5% bovine serum albumin
for 1 h at room temperature. PD-L1 RabMab antibodies (ab205921) (Abcam,
USA; at dilution of 1:800–1000) were applied overnight at 4
°C. The membrane was washed with TBST and then incubated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat
antirabbit IgG H&L (HRP), ab97051) (Abcam, USA; at dilution 1:5000)
for 2 h. After washing, protein bands were visualized using Clarity
western ECL substrate (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using ImageJ v1.40 software.
