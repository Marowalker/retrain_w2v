In
this work, we report the synthesis of Pd-based ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites using molecular precursors. This method is
facile, less time-consuming, and cost-effective. This catalyst is
prepared within 2 h by a solvothermal route using molecular precursors.
Information about the phase, morphologies, elemental mapping, and
composition of the nanocomposites was obtained using various characterization
techniques. The catalytic activity of the as-prepared Pd-based ternary
Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites exhibits effective reduction
efficiency for the conversion of toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) using formic
acid as a reducing agent within 5–7 min. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report on Pd-based ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites prepared by a solvothermal route and used
as catalysts toward the reduction of hexavalent chromium at room temperature.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
the synthesis of nanocomposites and their applications
in selective organic transformations from wastewater have been investigated
extensively. Hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is the most hazardous pollutant
found in soil, wastewater, and ground water.1 Various pigment manufacturing, leather tanning, metal finishing,
and electroplating industries make use of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI).
The effluents of such industries contain a large amount of hexavalent
chromium Cr(VI) which is nonbiodegradable and exists for a longer
period in the environment. Chromium is a heavy metal having variable
oxidation states, with two valence states, hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)
and trivalent chromium Cr(III). Cr(III) is less harmful as compared
to Cr(VI).2,3 Because Cr(VI) has strong oxidizing properties,
it is more toxic and contains carcinogenic species as compared to
Cr(III) species. Because of high toxicity of Cr(VI) at very low concentration,
it has the ability to cause hazardous threats to human and other living
organisms such as it can increase the risk of DNA mutation and lung
cancer by chronic inhalation.1,4,5

Various semiconductor catalysts such as TiO2,6−8 NiO@TiO2,9 ZnO@TiO2,10 ZnO,11 Fe3O4@graphene,12 Pd@SiO2–NH2,2 ZnO–TiO2–OCNT,13 and CdS/RGO14 have been reported for the reduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III). Recently, the use of formic acid (HCOOH) as a reducing
agent for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) has been reported because
of its simplicity and efficiency.5,15−18 In general mechanism, HCOOH undergoes a dehydrogenation decomposition
process to generate CO2 and H2 (HCOOH →
CO2 + H2). This H2 adsorbs on the
surface of nanocomposites, which is mainly responsible for the reduction
of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Cr2O72– + 8H+ + 3H2 → 2Cr3+ + 7H2O).2,5,19−25 Generally, noble and transition metals Pd, Pt, Ru, Ag, and so forth
are active catalysts for many catalytic hydrogenolyses and catalytic
reduction of heavy metal pollutants. Although Pd is a high-cost metal,
it has many more uses in electrocatalysis, C–C coupling reactions,
and other catalytic reductions. Many researchers have focused on the
fabrication of Pd-based nanocomposites with low-cost transition metals,
which provide high efficiency in catalytic sites. According to World
Health Organization (WHO), hexavalent chromium Cr(VI) is the most
hazardous pollutant, hence there is a need to develop practical and
cost-effective methodologies for reductive transformation of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III). The Pd-based catalyst has high efficiency for the reduction
of Cr(VI).2,15−18,26,27

So far, various methods such as chemical
reduction, ion exchange,
photocatalysis, and adsorption have been used for the reduction of
Cr(VI) to Cr(III). For example, modified TiO2-mediated
photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) has been reported by
Acharya et al.28 However, the advantage
of a chemical reduction method that has been used in the present study
is that there is no need of external source of light and that reduction
can be carried out at room temperature (RT) using a simple reducing
agent.

Herein, we report a facile and efficient route for the
synthesis
of binary CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites and Pd-based ternary
Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites by a solvothermal route using
CdCl2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (precursor I), CdI2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (precursor II) (where 4-MebenztsczH = 4-methylbenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone),
and titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OC3H7)4) as molecular precursors. As these molecular precursors contain
both metallic and nonmetallic parts, they act as good precursors for
the synthesis of semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs). The use of such
molecular precursors provides several advantages such as minimization
of expensive chemicals, low toxicity, limited or no prereactions,
and so forth.29,30

The catalytic reductive
efficiency has been further studied using
as-prepared Pd-based ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites
(TNC-I obtained from precursor I and TNC-II obtained from precursor II) for the reduction
of toxic hexavalent Cr(VI) to Cr(III). For comparison, the catalytic
reduction of Cr(VI) has also been studied using binary CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites (BNC-I obtained from precursor I and BNC-II obtained from precursor II). Two different precursors, that is, (CdCl2(4-MebenztsczH)2 and CdI2(4-MebenztsczH)2), were used
to prepare the composites. This was carried out in order to find out
whether two different precursors result into different composites,
which may result into different catalytic activities.

2 Results and Discussion
The characterization of the precursors
was done by elemental analysis
and 1H and 13C {1H} nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) (Figures S1 and S2). The IR spectra of precursor I, precursor II, and ligand are shown in Figure S3. The peaks observed at 3433 and 3259
cm–1 (for precursor I) and 3395 and
3287 cm–1 (for precursor II) are attributed
to νNH2 asymmetric and symmetric vibrations,
respectively. The bands at 3162 and 3188 cm–1 (for
precursor I and precursor II, respectively)
are observed because of νNH. The bands at 1536 and
1526 cm–1 (for precursor I and precursor II, respectively) are assigned to νC=N. The bands at 946 and 955 cm–1 are attributed
to νC=S for precursor I and precursor II, respectively. The bands observed for νC=N in the case of precursor I and precursor II are shifted to lower wavenumber as compared to the band observed
for the ligand (1594 cm–1).

In the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns, the sharp and intense
diffraction peaks observed (Figure 1) show successful formation of Pd-based ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites and binary CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites
(Figure S4). They match with anatase TiO2 (JCPDS file no. 00-021-01272) and hexagonal CdS (JCPDS file
no. 00-041-1049). The additional peak observed at 2θ = 39.4°
for TNC-I and 2θ = 39.8° for TNC-II confirmed the successful loading of Pd on the surface of CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites,31,32 and it was observed
that the crystallinity is retained after the loading of Pd as shown
in Figure 1. The average
particle size was calculated using the Scherrer formula,33 which was found to be 10.26 nm (TNC-I), 7.31 nm (TNC-II), 30.5 nm (BNC-I), and
13.3 nm (BNC-II) for as-prepared nanocomposites.

of as-prepared nanocomposites obtained from TNC-I (I)
and TNC-II (II).

In order to examine the morphology and elemental mapping
of as-prepared
Pd-based ternary nanocomposites, we have carried out high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) (Figure S5), TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and SEM–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping studies. TEM images are
shown in Figure 2.
From Figure 2Ia,IIa,
spherical morphologies of the nanoclusters (TNC-I and TNC-II) can be seen. Figure 2Ib,IIb shows selected-area electron diffraction (SAED)
patterns revealing the polycrystallinity of these materials. This
was further confirmed by SEM and SEM–EDS elemental mapping.
The SEM images show a spherical shaped morphology for as-prepared
Pd-based ternary nanoclusters (TNC-I and TNC-II) (Figure 3a,b). The
elemental mapping analysis of as-prepared Pd-based ternary nanoclusters
confirmed that palladium (Pd) is evenly distributed on the surface
of CdS@TiO2. In addition, the EDS elemental mapping of
as-prepared Pd-based ternary nanoclusters shows the even elemental
distribution of Ti, O, S, Cd, and Pd as given in Figure 3a,b for TNC-I and TNC-II, respectively. Their corresponding EDS spectra are
shown in Figure S6a,b. The SEM images of BNC-I and BNC-II are shown in Figure S7, which confirm the successful formation of binary
nanocomposites.

of TNC-I and TNC-II.

The formation of binary and Pd-based
ternary nanoclusters was further
studied by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The peaks observed
at 602 and 609 cm–1 for BNC-I and BNC-II, respectively, as shown in Figure S8 and 599 and 627 cm–1 for TNC-I and TNC-II, respectively, as shown in Figure 4 confirm the stretching vibration
bands of Cd–S.34,35 Along with that, the peaks observed
in the vicinity of 400–800 cm–1 in both the
nanocomposites correspond to the stretching vibration of Ti–O–Ti
in TiO2.36,37 This was further confirmed by
Raman analysis.

Figure 4 FTIR spectra of as-prepared TNC-I (I) and TNC-II (II).

Raman spectra of the as-prepared Pd-based ternary nanoclusters
have been recorded with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source to
investigate the various phases present in the as-prepared Pd-based
nanoclusters Figure 5. CdS shows Raman vibrational bands at 263.7 and 565.6 cm–1 for TNC-I and 269.5 and 584.6 cm–1 for TNC-II, and the weak bands at 353.9 cm–1 for TNC-I and 354.7 cm–1 for TNC-II are assigned to the multiphonon scattering in CdS.38−40 The presence of TiO2 can be confirmed by the vibration
peaks observed around 388–390, 484–499, and 611–613
cm–1 (for TNC-I and TNC-II).41−45 There is no intense Raman vibrational peak observed around 640 cm–1 (for TNC-I and TNC-II),
which confirms the presence of Pd only. This is well supported by
XRD results.44,45

Figure 5 Raman spectra of as-prepared TNC-I (I) and TNC-II (II).

The presence of Pd on CdS@TiO2 nanoclusters was
confirmed
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. Figures 6 and 7 show the XPS spectra of as-prepared nanoclusters TNC-I and TNC-II, which give the evidence of the presence
of Cd, S, Ti, and O. It provides two states for cadmium (Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2), two states for sulfur (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2), two states for titanium (Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2), and one state for oxygen (O 1s).
The binding energies located at 405 and 412 eV are attributed to Cd
3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 states of cadmium as shown
in Figure 6 (TNC-I). The peak located at 407 eV for Cd 3d5/2 and the peak located at 413 eV for Cd 3d3/2 are shown
in Figure 7 (TNC-II). These observations suggest that cadmium is in the
Cd2+ chemical state.46−49 The binding energy of sulfur is 161 eV for S 2p3/2 and 163 eV for S 2p1/2 for TNC-I (Figure 6). For the
material obtained from TNC-II, the binding energy for
S 2p3/2 is 163 eV as shown in Figure 7. This suggests that sulfur is in the S2– chemical state.50,51 Similarly,
the peaks obtained from TNC-I and TNC-II located around 459–460 eV for Ti 2p3/2 and 464–466
eV for Ti 2p1/2 (Figures 6 and 7) indicate that titanium
is in the chemical state of Ti4+ and the oxygen shows binding
energies of 530 and 532 eV as shown in Figure 6 and 533 eV as shown in Figure 7, corresponding to the oxygen
O 1s peak. This is due to Ti–O in TiO2 and hydroxyl
groups.52−57 Further, palladium was confirmed in the states of Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2 with the binding energies of 336 eV (Pd
3d5/2) and 342 eV (Pd 3d3/2) as shown in Figure 6 (TNC-I) and 338 eV (Pd 3d5/2) and 344 eV (Pd 3d3/2) as shown in Figure 7 (TNC-II). The peak positions were attributed to the
Pd 3d level, which is well matched with the previous literature.58−60

The optical properties observed by UV–visible diffuse
reflectance
spectroscopy (UV-DRS) were found to be enhanced toward the visible
region because of the addition of Pd, that is, Pd@CdS@TiO2, as shown in Figure 8. Their corresponding band gaps were found to be 2.09 and 2.10 eV
for the materials obtained from TNC-I and TNC-II, respectively (inset Figure 8). They were calculated using Tauc’s plot.61,62 For comparison, similar band gap calculations were carried for binary
CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites. Their band gaps were found to
be 2.30 and 2.28 eV for the materials obtained from BNC-I and BNC-II, respectively. The absorption spectra and
corresponding Tauc’s plots of binary nanocomposites are given
in Figure S9.

corresponding band gaps
calculated by Tauc’s plot.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of binary and ternary
nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 9. The transfer and fate of photogenerated carriers are mainly investigated
by PL spectra. The Pd-based ternary nanocomposites show lower intensities
when compared with that of the binary nanocomposites. This phenomenon
takes place because the Pd metal in ternary nanocomposites has higher
Fermi energy level, which increases the electron-transfer reaction
and leads to the prolonged electron–hole pair recombination.63,64

The catalytic efficiency of the
as-prepared Pd-based ternary nanoclusters
was evaluated at RT for the reduction of highly toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III).
It was monitored by UV–vis spectra with the absorption peak
observed at 349 nm for Cr(VI) as shown in Figure 10. Yu et al.3 suggested
that Pd provides large active sites and large surface for the enhancement
of catalytic reduction of Cr(VI). It was observed that in the presence
of Pd-based ternary nanoclusters, the absorption peaks of Cr(VI) decrease
rapidly. Further, the peaks disappear completely, indicating the reduction
of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) by HCOOH which was used as a reducing agent
within 5 min for TNC-I and 7 min for TNC-II. It reveals that the as-prepared Pd-based ternary nanoclusters are
more active and show greater catalytic reductive efficiency for Cr(VI).
The recyclability of the catalysts TNC-I and TNC-II has also been performed. It is found that up to three cycles, the
catalysts are stable and have good efficiency for the reduction of
Cr(VI) (Figure S10). In the literature,
it is reported that HCOOH gets adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst
reducing itself into CO2 and H2. This plays
a very important role in the catalytic reduction of Cr(VI).22,23 During the reduction process, successive color change from yellow
to colorless is observed, which indicates successful reduction of
Cr(VI) to Cr(III) (Figure 11A). This was further confirmed by the addition of excess of
NaOH to the final solution. The color of solution changed to green
after addition of excess NaOH because of the formation of hexahydroxochromate(III),
which clearly gives the evidence for the presence of Cr(III).2 For comparison, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
using only HCOOH as a reducing agent (i.e., without the catalyst)
(Figure S11) and also only binary CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites as a catalyst (Figure S12) was carried out. It was observed that even after 70 min
of reaction time, no complete reduction of Cr(VI) takes place. The
binary nanocomposites (BNC-I and BNC-II)
show less efficiency for the reduction of Cr(VI) as compared to TNC-I and TNC-II nanoclusters because of the
synergistic effect of Pd on the surface of TNCs. The plots of C/Co versus irradiation time
for the catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the presence as
well as in the absence of the catalyst are shown in Figure 11B, and for comparison, reduction
of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) was studied in the presence of the catalyst in
the dark (Figure S13), where Co is the initial concentration and C is
the final concentration at each time interval. The kinetic plots and
rate constants calculated for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) with
binary and ternary nanocatalysts are of pseudo-first-order (Figure S14). It was observed that the rate constant k values of TNCs and BNCs are 0.433 (TNC-I),
0.516 (TNC-II), 0.015 (BNC-I), and 0.0218
(BNC-II). The higher k values demonstrate
the enhancement of catalytic activity for the reduction of Cr(VI). TNC-I exhibits 28 times higher activity than BNC-I and TNC-II exhibits 24 times higher activity than BNC-II.
From Figure S13, it can be seen that there
is not much reduction in the dark. The catalytic reduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III) is compared with the other catalysts reported in the literature
(Table 1). It has been
observed that the catalytic reduction efficiency of TNC-I and TNC-II nanoclusters reported in this work is remarkably
better compared to those reported in the literature.

The mechanism of catalytic activity of the materials can be explained
as shown in Figure 12 and Scheme 1. Although
TiO2 has been extensively used as a catalyst because it
is less toxic, less expensive, and highly abundant and has excellent
photochemical stability, it has a limitation of having a wide band
gap due to which it absorbs UV radiation only.28 To be an effective catalyst, it is necessary that a material
should absorb sunlight effectively and there should be sufficient
electron–hole pair separation so that the electrons are available
for reduction.

Figure 12 Schematic possible mechanism of the catalytic reduction
of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III) over TNCs.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of HCOOH as a Hole Scavenger
Therefore, in order to facilitate
the absorption of the sunlight
and increase electron–hole pair separation, combination of
a narrow band gap semiconductor such as CdS with a wide band gap semiconductor
such as TiO2 is carried out. In this, TiO2 has
more positive conduction band than that of the CdS conduction band.
Therefore, the energetic electrons of the CdS conduction band transfer
to the conduction band of TiO2. These electrons are then
easily transported to the palladium surface and then subsequently
used for reduction. The noble metal can act as a trap in the catalytic
process to boost the electron–hole pair separation. Thus, the
introduction of a noble metal (Pd) on the surface of BNCs shows the
enhancement in the interfacial charge transfer as well as charge separation
efficiency, followed by an increase in the catalytic reductive efficiency
of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). The proposed design of TNCs that empower the
efficient CdS → TiO2 → Pd pathway for the
vectorial electron transfer is illustrated in Figure 12, which is also supported by PL studies.71−73

The catalytic reduction is further enhanced by scavenging
holes
present in the valence band of CdS using HCOOH as a scavenger (Scheme 1).74 This further hinders the charge carrier recombination rate,
thereby increasing the catalytic performance. Thus, HCOOH acts not
only as a reducing agent but also as a hole scavenger. Because of
this, the materials used in this work show significantly improved
catalytic activity.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we report the synthesis and characterization of
Pd-based Pd@CdS@TiO2 ternary nanoclusters by a solvothermal
route using molecular precursors. The as-prepared TNCs show more catalytic
efficiency to reduce highly toxic Cr(VI) to Cr(III) using HCOOH as
a reducing agent at RT. Pd doped on the surface of BNCs activates
the catalysts, hence it was observed that TNCs prepared from precursor I and precursor II show more efficiency than
BNCs. From PL studies, it can be seen that TNCs show lower intensity
as compared to BNCs, which results in slow electron–hole pair
recombination and enhances the catalytic reduction of Cr(VI). HCOOH
also acts as a scavenging agent for holes, thereby further enhancing
the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Thus, the environmental remediation
of highly toxic Cr(VI) has been carried out with the help of environmental
friendly, cost-effective, and highly efficient catalysts.

Further, these molecular
precursors (precursors I and II) were used
for the preparation of binary CdS@TiO2 and ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites.

4.3 One-Pot
Synthesis of Nanocomposites
4.3.1 Synthesis of Binary CdS@TiO2 Nanocomposites
(BNC-I and BNC-II)
Binary CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites using precursor I and precursor II were prepared by a solvothermal route.

In a typical
synthesis, Ti(OC3H7)4 (1 mL) and
CdCl2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (200 mg) (precursor I) were taken in a round-bottom flask containing 50 mL of
EG. The mixture was sonicated for 30 min, and further it was allowed
to stir and reflux for 2 h at 200 °C under nitrogen atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to RT. The yellowish product
obtained was washed and centrifuged 4–5 times with methanol
to remove the excess of EG. The final product obtained was dried under
vacuum and characterized.

Similarly, binary CdS@TiO2 (BNC-II) using
CdI2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (precursor II) was prepared and characterized.

4.3.2 Synthesis
of Pd-Based Ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 Nanocomposites (TNC-I and TNC-II)
Pd-based Pd@CdS@TiO2 (from precursor I) and Pd@CdS@TiO2 (from
precursor II) ternary nanocomposites were prepared by
a solvothermal route using
molecular precursors as follows.

In this synthesis, 1 mL of
titanium isopropoxide and 200 mg of CdCl2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (precursor I) were taken in 50 mL of EG. The
mixture was sonicated for 30 min. After sonication, the solution was
allowed to stir and reflux. To this solution, 20 mg of PdCl2 was added, followed by the addition of 50 mg of NaBH4 under the refluxing condition. The final reaction mixture was refluxed
for 2 h at 200 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Then the reaction
mixture was allowed to cool to RT. The blackish green product obtained
was washed and centrifuged 4–5 times with methanol to remove
the excess of EG and any other impurities present. The final product
was dried under vacuum.

Similarly, Pd-based Pd@CdS@TiO2 (TNC-II) was prepared using CdI2(4-MebenztsczH)2 (precursor II) and characterized (Scheme 2).

Precursor II (X = I)
4.4 Catalytic Dichromate Reduction
The
catalytic reduction of aqueous dichromate solution was further carried
out using as-prepared binary CdS@TiO2 (BNC-I and BNC-II) and Pd-based ternary Pd@CdS@TiO2 nanocomposites (TNC-I and TNC-II) for
the catalytic reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) according to the reported
method.76 Typically, 5 mg of as-prepared
Pd-based nanocatalysts in the mixture of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7, 150 ppm, 15 mL), HCOOH (85%,
1.5 mL), and deionized water (24 mL) was taken in a 50 mL beaker,
and the mixture was vigorously stirred using a magnetic stirrer. During
the reaction, the aliquots of 3 mL of aqueous solutions were withdrawn
at each predetermined time interval for checking the catalytic reduction
efficiency of the catalysts for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
by measuring the absorbance. A UV-2450 PC Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer
was used for this purpose. For comparison, the measurements were also
carried out without the catalyst under similar experimental conditions.

4.5 Material Characterization
FTIR spectroscopy
was recorded on a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer using KBr pellets
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1. A Thermo Finnigan,
Italy FLASH EA 1112 series analyzer was used for elemental analysis.
The 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra were
recorded in DMSO-d6 on a Bruker AVANCE
300 spectrophotometer. The internal standard, tetramethylsilane, was
used for 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra.
The UV–vis spectra were recorded on a UV-2450 PC Shimadzu UV–visible
spectrophotometer. Powder XRD was carried out on an XRD-7000 Shimadzu
X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at λ = 0.154060
nm. The Raman spectra were recorded on a Kaiser Optical Systems Inc.
(KOSI) laser Raman spectrometer. The morphologies and EDS were observed
using JEOL JSM-7600 FEG-SEM with an operating voltage of 0.1–30
kV. TEM and SAED were recorded on PHILIPS, CM 200 with an operating
voltage between 20 and 200 kV. The XPS recording was carried out on
an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (AXIS Supra) Kratos Analytical,
UK (SHIMADZU group) using (Al Kα) 600 W X-ray source, 1486.6
eV. The UV-DRS spectra were recorded on a UV-2450 PC Shimadzu UV–visible
spectrophotometer using barium sulfate (BaSO4) as the standard.
A PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer was used for recording
PL spectra.
