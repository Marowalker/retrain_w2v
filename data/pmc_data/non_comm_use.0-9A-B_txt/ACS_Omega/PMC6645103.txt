Polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) waste often contains a large amount
of thermally unstable contaminants and additives that negatively impacts
processing. A reduced processing temperature is desired. In this work,
we report using a renewably sourced tall oil fatty acid (TOFA) as
a modifier for recycled PET. To that end, PET was compounded with
TOFA at different concentrations and extruded at 240 °C. Phase
transition behaviors characterized by thermal and dynamic mechanical
analyses exhibit shifts in the melting and recrystallization temperatures
of PET to lower temperatures and depression of glass transition temperature
from 91 to 65 °C. Addition of TOFA also creates crystal-phase
imperfection that slows recrystallization, an important processing
parameter. Changes in the morphology of plasticized PET reduces and
stabilizes the melt viscosity at 240 and 250 °C. Melt-spun, undrawn
continuous filaments of diameter 36–46 μm made from these
low-melting PET exhibit 29–38 MPa tensile strength, 2.7–2.8
GPa tensile modulus, and 20–36% elongation. These results suggest
a potential path for reusing waste PET as high-performance polymeric
fibers.

==== Body
Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) is a semicrystalline thermoplastic
polyester commodity broadly used in the packaging and apparel industries.
It has been estimated that 485 billion individual PET bottles were
produced globally in 2016, and the number is forecasted to grow over
the next 5 years.1 Production of beverage
bottles comes at a price, as the generated waste must be dealt with
continually. Postindustrial and postconsumer PET waste often goes
to landfills and creates environmental hazards because of lack of
biodegradation of PET.2 To address the
environmental issues and create potential new revenue streams for
these wastes, it is logical to recycle the wastes into reusable polymer
systems for a variety of end uses.

Recycling can expand the
spent PET to novel applications,3 but the
cost to performance ratio must be reasonable.
For example, the toughness can be improved by successful modification
and/or plasticization to reduce the melting point of the crystalline
phase and decrease the glass temperature Tg of the amorphous phase.4 PET can be blended
with thermally unstable materials such as polyacrylonitrile, acrylonitrile
butadiene styrene, poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), phenolic resin, and
lignin, and then to achieve success with those compositions, PET needs
to be softened and melted at lower temperature. The reduction in these
transition temperatures via changes in the molecular dynamics requires
careful selection of the plasticizer. The possibility of enhanced
chain mobility and depressing Tg of PET
has been well-studied. In fact, small amounts of codiols or long diols
as comonomers were used to plasticize PET.5,6 Gowd
used two distinct types of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and a solid-state
polymerization route to plasticize PET.7 The results showed that the Tg and the
crystallization rate were affected by the PEG nature. A systematic
investigation of CO2-induced crystallization of PET by
Mizoguchi showed that sorbed CO2 is in fact an effective
plasticizer for PET.8 The evaluation of
the plasticizing ability of CO2, as reported in a different
study, was based mostly on the mobility of the polymer segment and
the reduction of Tg measured, which in
part is due to the high solubility of CO2 in PET.9

In the specific instance of choosing a
plasticizer for polymer
systems, renewable plasticizers are preferred as alternatives to their
petroleum-based counterparts, in part because of environmental issues,
renewability, and cost-effectiveness.10,11 Some reported
renewable plasticizers include soybean oil fatty acid methyl ester12 and benzyl ester of dehydrated castor oil fatty
acid.13 An example of a renewable plasticizer
and polymer system was reported by Wang.14 The work evaluated palm oil as a plasticizer for ethylene propylene
diene monomer (EPDM) rubber. When added to EPDM, palm oil acts like
paraffin oil, a conventional petroleum-derived plasticizer, by reducing
the viscosity to improve the processability. PVC has been recently
plasticized with novel soybean oil-based polyol ester.15 The plasticizing effect of the polyol ester
was very pronounced and effective when compared with some conventional
plasticizers for PVC. Additionally, an improvement in thermal stability
was reported.

The success of different renewable-based plasticizers
for polymeric
systems addresses many environmental issues and is a path toward sustainable
development. To this end, we have identified tall oil fatty acid (TOFA)
as a potential renewable plasticizer for postindustrial PET resin.
TOFA is a byproduct of the kraft paper-making industry that uses pine
trees.16 It mainly consists of oleic acid
and is cost-effective. The goal here is to use the renewable plasticizer
to reduce the viscosity and improve the processing characteristics.
This will broaden end-use applications of postindustrial PET scraps
from resin manufacturers, bottle manufacturing facilities, and postconsumer
wastes. Continuous fibers were also spun using the plasticized matrices
to demonstrate favorable processability. Using TOFA in combination
with the postindustrial PET waste gave a modified PET suitable to
expand the application horizon where lower melting temperature of
PET is desired.

Results and Discussion
Thermal Characteristics
Polymeric materials are macromolecules
with intramolecular cohesive forces among them. When heat is applied,
the macromolecules become soft and flexible and easy to process. Low-molecular-weight
plasticizers are often added to increase the flexibility at room temperature
and to improve processing. Evidence of the plasticizing effect of
TOFA is shown in Figure 1a. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermograms depict that
as the amount of TOFA renewable plasticizer increases, the PET melting
peak shifts toward lower temperature. Neat PET is a heterogeneous
polyester with both amorphous and crystalline domains. Its thermogram
shows a large endotherm with a peak temperature at ∼248 °C
corresponding to melting of crystals. The peak shifts to lower temperature
as more and more plasticizer is added. The low-molecular-weight renewable
plasticizer TOFA inserts its molecules between the crystalline domains
of PET allowing for softening and increased flexibility. The depression
of melting temperatures Tm1 and Tm2 reduces the processing temperature of PET.
In parallel, incorporation of TOFA shifts the recrystallization Trec to lower temperatures (Figure 1b) because of the TOFA-induced
PET chain flexibility that alters the crystallization kinetics discussed
in detail later.

its plasticized
derivatives. (a) DSC second-heating thermograms, (b) DSC cooling thermograms,

The change in crystallization
behavior was evaluated and is reported
in Table 1 using the
thermodynamic melting enthalpy from the DSC thermograms in eq 1. The neat PET ΔHm is 48.6 J/g, which is lower than that of 100%
crystalline PET (140 J/g) with a degree of crystallinity of 34.7%. XC values of TOFA-plasticized PET are all slightly
higher than that of as-received PET except PR10. It is apparent that
addition of TOFA favors segmental molecular mobility of PET, which
affects the crystallinity. Although the presence of TOFA increases
PET crystallinity, it is obvious that the modified PET crystals are
low-melting and imperfect.

b Tg reported
from tan δ peak.

The
storage modulus E′, related to the
material stiffness, decreased with the addition of the plasticizer.
Changes in the phase structure because of incorporation of TOFA cause
the storage modulus to decrease (Figure 1c). The sharp drop of E′
for all samples as the temperature increases signals that glass transition
events are occurring in the amorphous phase. Like most polymers, PET
undergoes thermophysical transitions around its glass transition temperature Tg. Tg is known as
the temperature at which binding forces between polymer chains are
relaxed to initiate large-scale molecular movements. Tg is considered as an essential processing parameter as
it helps to define the state of polymers at their service temperatures.
Here, Tg, as reported in Table 1, is the maximum peak of the
loss factor tan δ (Figure 1d). The as-received PET has a Tg of 91 °C. As expected, addition of the renewable plasticizer
decreases Tg. TOFA addition depresses Tg of PET by up to 25 °C at 30 wt % addition,
which is evidence of pronounced plasticization. TOFA presence allowed
the PET matrix to become less dense and facilitate motion of the PET
molecular segments to start at lower temperature.

Crystallization
Behavior
The recrystallization temperature
(Trec) and enthalpy (ΔHrec) of neat PET decrease as the cooling rate increases
(Figure 2). Plasticization
is observed as the PET crystallizes faster than the plasticized PET
resins at lower cooling rates, but the difference in Trec is minimal at 30 °C/min rate. Trec is critical in polymer processing, especially for
a semicrystalline polymer such as PET. It is measured as the solidification
temperature. The fact that neat PET and TOFA-plasticized PET display Trec values close to each other at high cooling
rates suggests that the crystallization mechanism is not much affected
by the addition of TOFA. This is beneficial for a process such as
extrusion where high cooling rates are desired. ΔHrec of plasticized resins diminish as the TOFA amount
increases, except at higher TOFA content (Figure 2b). Nevertheless, it increases as the cooling
rate increases, which is indifferent to neat PET. Crystallization
temperatures shift to lower temperatures with the addition of TOFA
renewable plasticizer. Such reduction can be explained by two interconnected
facts. First, TOFA addition depresses Tg and increases chain mobility, and second, TOFA addition decreases
the melting point of PET, which also retards crystal growth. Furthermore,
the slopes of Trec versus log cooling
rate curves suggest that excess TOFA reduces the crystallization rate
because a steeper slope (neat PET) means faster crystallization compared
to a gentle slope (e.g., 30 wt %).

Flow Characteristics
Oscillatory frequency sweeps were
used to evaluate the as-received PET and TOFA-plasticized PET resin
flow characteristics. The angular frequency (ω) dependence of
the complex viscosity (η*) and the storage modulus (G′) in the linear region have a more developed sensitivity
to structural variation than the power-law region (Figure 3). At 240 °C (Figure 3a), neat PET shows
a Newtonian behavior at very low frequency followed by normal shear
thinning behavior where the complex viscosity starts to decrease with
increasing angular frequency. The viscosity is high and decreases
progressively because the data are collected in the linear region
and the temperature is below the melting temperature recorded by DSC
(248 °C). It is anticipated that chain disentanglement and mobility
are limited because of lack of energy to disrupt them. The plasticized
PET resins, however, show a similar decrease of viscosity with increasing
frequency, but the slopes of the flow curves are sharper. Also, PR10
and PR20 show high viscosity at low frequency compared to neat PET.
The effect of the plasticizer is evident for all three plasticized
PET resins at 250 °C (Figure 3b). The plasticization effect becomes more pronounced
as the viscosity decreases with increasing plasticizer amount, and
the slopes of all curves are steadier. The flow behavior shows that
changes are occurring in the molecular structure of plasticized PET
because of the addition of TOFA as a softening agent. Such an interaction
is typical for excellent plasticizers as they decrease the viscosity
and hence improve the processing properties of PET. The master curves
at Tref = 240 °C in Figure 3c show that the storage modulus G′ increases with increasing ω. A sharp increase
in G′ is observed in neat PET, but for all
three plasticized PET resins, the increase is progressive. Also, all
three plasticized resins have higher G′ values
at low frequency, and G′ for PR10 and PR20
continues to be higher than that of neat PET at below 10 rad/s. The
master curves at Tref = 250 °C in Figure 3d show that neat
PET has the highest G′ over the whole frequency
range indicating the highest rigidity. The slopes are different, but
all storage moduli increase with increasing angular frequency. The
TOFA-modified resins’ G′ values decrease
with increasing plasticizer-loading amounts over the entire frequency
range. This suggests that the plasticizer lubricates the PET chains,
and the plasticization effect not only favors a change in the morphology
and increased chain mobility but also strongly affects the moduli
of the modified resins. This is a strong indication of improved processing
characteristics of the modified PET.

Morphological Evaluation
Representative scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) micrographs of cryofractured surfaces of the as-received
waste polyester and the TOFA-plasticized matrices are represented
in Figure 4. The as-received
PET surface shows a relatively smooth fracture surface with residual
morphology left by the fracture path (Figure 4a). The plasticized PET samples, however,
exhibit a completely different topography of the fractured surface.
The surfaces have cavities created by the addition of TOFA that are
very well statistically dispersed and are around 0.2–1 μm
in size (Figure 4b–d).
For the 30 wt % plasticized resin, the cavities are larger because
of coalescence of the extra amount of TOFA during melt mixing, which
creates large agglomeration. The observations clearly show that TOFA
acts as a lubricant by inserting itself in the polyester matrix and
favors chain motion and slippage of molecular constituents. This in
turn introduces the thermophysical changes detected by thermal and
dynamic mechanical analyses (Figure 1). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra show (Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S2) that
minimal changes in the chemical structure were observed in PET blended
with TOFA. However, an expansion of the O–H region within 3300–3600
cm–1 shows an evolution of the −OH stretching
with the increase of TOFA content. Also, the presence of available
C=C bonds in TOFA can promote the π–π stacking
with double bonds of phenolic groups in PET. The similar structures
of the carboxylic acid group from TOFA with the ester groups and the
capping −COOH group from PET promotes strong molecular interactions
between PET and TOFA. TOFA has a linear flexible backbone enabling
TOFA to behave like a “good solvent” to increase the
chain mobility of PET in the PR30 or PET/TOFA mixture. As a result,
TOFA facilitates to reduce the melt flow of PET in the PET/TOFA mixtures
(see Figure 3a,b).
An attempt to dissolve PET and PR30 in 2-chlorophenol confirmed the
existence of strong intermolecular interactions between TOFA and PET,
which decrease the intramolecular interactions between PET chains
resulting in better solubility of PR30 in 2-chlorophenol (Supporting Information Figure S11). This observation
also corroborates very well with the thermal analysis discussed in
the previous section. The intermolecular interactions between TOFA
and PET retard the PET chain association during the recrystallization
process, resulting in a low recrystallization temperature. For example,
the recrystallization temperature of PET is reduced by ca. 12 °C
with the presence of 30 wt % TOFA (see Table 1). We anticipate that these are physical
interactions rather than chemical bonds of TOFA with PET. To evaluate
the changes in PET chemical structures, if any, in the presence of
TOFA, we performed both 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
and 13C NMR analyses. The results are shown in Supporting Information Figures S3 through S10.
The NMR analysis of PET, TOFA, PR30, and PET/TOFA (hand-mixed at a
composition of 50 mg/15 mg and counterpart of the PR30 that was melt-mixed)
in 2:1 v/v hexafluoro isopropyl alcohol-d2 (HFIP-d2)/CDCl3 shows no
noteworthy differences in the chemical shifts of the PET and TOFA
components in the samples. Also, the PR30 sample did not exhibit new
peaks and was relatively identical to the hand-mixed PET/TOFA sample.
This is consistent with the absence of a chemical reaction between
PET and TOFA during the melt extrusion process. Although the PR30
and PET/TOFA (50 mg/15 mg, hand-mixed) spectra were virtually identical
regarding the chemical shifts of the observed peaks, one surprise
was that the NMR analysis seems to reveal that some TOFA is lost during
the extrusion process, but this is a result that we want to look into
further in our ongoing work with these PET/TOFA extrudates.

Properties of Fibers Spun from Plasticized Polyester Resins
The TOFA-plasticized matrices were melt-spun to produce continuous
filaments using the benchtop extruder previously used for blending.
The extruder and attached spinneret temperatures were set to 240 and
245 °C, respectively, for all samples, which is well below the
neat PET working temperatures (∼270–285 °C). The
30 wt % plasticized matrix spun the best out of all formulations.
This can be explained by the pronounced effect the plasticizer has
on lowering the viscosity at the spinning temperatures, as shown in
flow characterization (Figure 3). Fibers from all matrices were collected continuously on
a spool. The winding speed needed to be adjusted based on the material
viscosity. For instance, 30 wt % plasticized PET was collected at
130 m/min compared to 10 wt % plasticized matrix at 80 m/min. These
parameters will affect the mechanical performance of the fibers.

Thermal analysis by DSC (Supporting Information, Figure S12) shows interesting thermal behavior of the fibers. The
first heating thermogram (Figure S12a)
shows early relaxation around 50 °C for all samples that started
at lower temperature for the 30 wt % TOFA content PET fibers. The
relaxation was followed by a cold crystallization around 100 °C
and melting behavior at 240 °C. The melt-spinning process may
have induced a metaorder structure because of high chain alignment.
In Figure S12b,c, the fibers behave more
like their starting matrices, showing recrystallization and melting
peaks and similar shifts in their peak temperatures, as reported in Figure 1a,b.

The single
fibers were isolated for tensile testing. The results
are reported in Table 2. All fiber groups showed adequate tensile performances (tensile
strength of 29–38 MPa, tensile modulus 2.7–2.8 GPa,
and elongation at break of 20–36%). It is important to recall
that the limitation of our setup and the viscosity difference between
the matrices made it impossible to produce the fibers using the same
processing conditions, which affected the tensile properties of the
fiber generated. For example, attempt was made to collect the filaments
at higher speed as much as possible, which is critical to alignment
of the polymer chains in the fibers and influences the strength of
the fibers. However, PR30, which was collected at higher speed, did
not have the highest tensile strength. Defects created by a large
amount of TOFA could be the reason for the weaker tensile strength.
Also, PR30 did not have the smallest fiber diameter. This suggests
that a lower recrystallization temperature affects the 30 wt % plasticized
matrix’s overall fiber diameter. The performance of fibers
displayed here could have improved if annealed at lower temperature
before mechanical testing. Morphological evaluation of the fiber using
SEM (Figure 5) shows
the longitudinal surface of the fibers. It is evident that the 10
wt % TOFA-plasticized PET has a small fiber diameter, and very fine
fibers were observed. The fibers’ surfaces were not smooth
and uniform as desired, which could be caused by the die capillary
or temperature setup.

Conclusions
We have identified renewable TOFA, a byproduct of the kraft paper
making industry that uses pine trees, to plasticize polyester waste
that would have ended up in landfill and caused an environmental hazard.
The addition of TOFA induced changes in the structure and morphology
of postindustrial PET. The melting temperature, recrystallization
temperature, and Tg were shifted to lower
temperatures because of increased chain mobility demonstrated by thermal
and rheology analyses. The polymer blends were used to generate continuous
fibers with acceptable tensile properties regardless of the processing
setup. For example, 10 wt % TOFA-loaded PET (the least plasticized
one) could be spun into filaments with higher strength; however, these
filaments made from the most plasticized compositions (20 and 30 wt
% TOFA) crystallized quickly and formed the largest diameter filaments.
The developed blends obtained from manufacturing waste showed thermal
and flow behaviors that can expand their end-use applications and
create revenue from waste materials. In summary, TOFA shows potential
as a renewable and cost-effective plasticizer for postindustrial PET
wastes.

Experimental Section
Materials
Thermoplastic polyester
PET was received
from Eastman Chemicals USA. It is a scrap from the resin manufacturing
facility and supplied as a white powder. Melt flow rate measured in
our laboratory was 55 g/10 min (2.16 kg at 280 °C). PET was dried
under vacuum at 130 °C for 8 h to avoid hydrolytic degradation
during melt processing. TOFA (Westvaco L-5 TOFA [CAS # 61790-12-3])
was acquired from Westvaco Chemicals, Charleston SC. The specifications
of TOFA were reported as acid number (min 190), rosin acids (max 5%),
and color or Gardner (max 7). On the basis of the NMR analysis of
TOFA, it is primarily oleic acid in composition.

Blending of
Postindustrial Polyester and TOFA
Dried
polyester PET and TOFA were melt mixed at 240 °C in a HAAKE MiniLab
corotating twin-screw extruder (Thermo Scientific). TOFA was added
in 3 different wt % (10, 20, and 30). The extruder had one zone heated
with a screw length of 110 mm. The blends were processed at a screw
rotation speed of 30 rpm. The extrudates were collected for further
analysis.

Blend Characterization
The three different extrudates
were named PR10, PR20, and PR30, respectively, in accordance with
the wt % of TOFA added (10, 20, and 30). DSC (DSC Q2000, TA Instruments)
was used to determine the thermal characteristics of the as-received
PET and the plasticized PET samples. Samples with a mass of approximately
3–4 mg each were loaded in hermetic pans for measurements.
A cycle of heating–cooling–heating from −50 to
300 °C at 10 °C/min and an isothermal of 2 min after first
heating were performed. The degree of crystallization was computed
from eq 1. The melting
enthalpy ΔHm was obtained from the
second heating curve. Wf is the PET weight
fraction in each composition, and ΔH100 is the theoretical fusion enthalpy of 100% crystalline PET (140
J/g).17 1  

The same setup of DSC was used but
at different ramping rates (2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 °C/min) to study
the crystallization rate of the as-received PET and plasticized PET
resins. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis of the blends was performed
using a TA Q800 (TA Instruments) analyzer in the tension mode. Monofilaments
of diameters varying from 0.20 to 0.45 mm generated from each sample
were used for testing. The measurements were conducted in the temperature
range of 30–150 °C and at frequencies of 1 Hz and 0.01%
strain. The heating rate was 3 °C/min. Cryogenically fractured
surfaces of extrudates were evaluated by SEM (Zeiss EVO MA 15). The
samples were also analyzed by solid-state FTIR spectroscopy (PerkinElmer
Frontier). A total of 32 scans were performed in the attenuated total
reflectance mode. Average spectra with 4 cm–1 resolution
were obtained for all samples. Proton and carbon NMR spectra were
obtained on a Varian VNMRS 500 NMR spectrometer at 24 °C. All
samples were dissolved in a 2:1 v/v mixture of HFIP-d2 (Alfa Aesar, 98 atom % D) and CDCl3. Chemical shifts were referenced to CDCl3 with
7.27 ppm for 1H and 77.23 ppm for 13C. Carbon
NMR spectra (125.667 MHz for 13C) were obtained using inverse-gated
decoupling with a recycle delay of 20 seconds and 3000 transients.
The rheological properties were evaluated using the discovery hybrid
rheometer (DHR-2, TA instruments). All measurements were carried out
at 3% strain, which is in the linear region as determined by a strain
sweep in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen. Frequency sweeps from 100
to 1 rad/s at different temperatures were performed.

Fiber Melt-Spinning
and Characterization
The twin-screw
extruder was also used to generate continuous single fibers from all
three plasticized PETs with TOFA. A 200 μm spinneret was attached
for fiber forming as the extrudate is forced through the orifice.
A 76 mm rotating drum was used to collect continuous single fibers.
Single fibers were isolated for mechanical testing. They were glued
onto a paper tab using an adhesive. The tabs were mounted into a set
of pneumatic grips, and the sides are cut at midgauge before load
application. The gauge length was 25.4 mm. The tabs enable consistent
and proper mounting of fiber specimens. An Instron 5943 testing system
equipped with Bluehill 3 software was used for mechanical testing
at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. The mean of 13 specimens was reported.
The fibers were also characterized by DSC based on sample preparation
and experimental conditions described above. SEM micrographs of the
fiber lateral surface were also obtained.
