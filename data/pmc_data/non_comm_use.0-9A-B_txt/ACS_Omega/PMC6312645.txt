Polyanionic
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play an important role in
regulating the permeability of the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative
bacteria. Impairment of the LPS-enriched OM is essential in initiating
the bactericidal activity of polymyxins. We are interested in how
colistin (polymyxin E) affects the membrane permeability of LPS/phospholipid
bilayers. Our vesicle leakage experiment showed that colistin binding
enhanced bilayer permeability; the maximum increase in the bilayer
permeability was positively correlated with the LPS fraction. Addition
of magnesium ions abolished the effect of LPS in enhancing bilayer
permeabilization. To describe the vesicle leakage behavior from a
structural perspective, we performed liquid atomic force microscopy
(AFM) measurements on planar lipid bilayers. We found that colistin
caused the formation of nano- and macroclusters that protruded from
the bilayer by ∼2 nm. Moreover, cluster development was promoted
by increasing the fraction of LPS or colistin concentration but inhibited
by magnesium ions. To explain our experimental data, we proposed a
lipid clustering model where colistin binds to LPS to form large-scale
complexes segregated from zwitterionic phospholipids. The discontinuity
(and thickness mismatch) at the edge of LPS–colistin clusters
will create a passage that allows solutes to permeate through. The
proposed model is consistent with all data obtained from our leakage
and AFM experiments. Our results of LPS-dependent membrane restructuring
provided useful insights into the mechanism that could be used by
polymyxins in impairing the permeability barrier of the OM of Gram-negative
bacteria.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polymyxins (A–E)
belong to a group of cyclic lipopeptides
with potent antimicrobial characteristics.1Figure 1 shows that
the heptapeptide ring of polymyxins is enriched with the unusual cationic
diaminobutyric acid (DAB); the C-terminus of the exocyclic tripeptide
is fused to the macrocyclic ring, whereas the N-terminus is linked
to a fatty acid tail (prominently 6-methyl-octanoic acid). Colistin
known as polymyxin E was initially derived from the Gram-positive
bacterium Bacillus colistinus. Colistin
is effective at a few micromolar concentrations to inhibit bacterial
growth or kill bacteria. Polymyxins, primarily polymyxin B and colistin,
were used as broad-spectrum antibiotics for clinical application starting
in the 1950s. Later, clinical experiences showed that polymyxin treatment
was often accompanied with neurotoxic and nephrotoxic effects, although
the toxicity was reversible upon discontinuation of the drug usage.2 The potential toxicity rendered polymyxins less
desirable compared to other antibiotics. The usage of polymyxins was
gradually abandoned in the early 1980s. Recently, multidrug-resistant
(MDR) bacterial pathogens, mostly Gram-negative species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter
baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, have emerged as a great health threat. Because of their potent
antimicrobial activities and low susceptibility to bacterial resistance,
polymyxins have received a renewed interest in combating MDR infections.3,4 In particular, polymyxins are currently used as last-resort drugs
to treat infections (e.g., cystic fibrosis) caused by microbes that
are resistant to almost all available antibiotics.5,6

Figure 1 Chemical
structure of colistin. The amphipathic peptide is composed
of a heptapeptide macrocycle, an exocyclic tripeptide, and an acyl
tail. Colistin has two hydrophobic domains, including the acyl chain
and the hydrophobic patch of the macrocycle at positions 6 and 7.
Cationic DABs are located at positions 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

The envelope of Gram-negative bacteria has a complex
multilayered
architecture, including the outer membrane (OM), the cytoplasmic membrane,
and a peptidoglycan layer located at the periplasmic space.7 The OM of Gram-negative bacteria forms a permeability
barrier that is essential to bacterial viability. The OM has an asymmetric
organization; the outer monolayer is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides
(LPS), whereas the inner leaflet is formed by phospholipids. Compared
to phospholipids, polyanionic LPS molecules are better suited for
intermolecular interactions to form a supramolecular organization.
Structurally, LPS can be divided into three regions: an amphipathic
lipid A moiety, a hydrophilic oligosaccharide core (including the
inner and outer cores), and an O-antigen chain. It is believed that
strong intermolecular interactions of LPS bridged by divalent cations
(e.g., Mg2+ and Ca2+) are the primary mechanism
of enhancing the OM stability and limiting the permeation of external
agents such as lipophilic antibiotic compounds.8,9

Polymyxins have a high affinity for LPS molecules.10−13 This is exemplified by the antiendotoxic
effect of polymyxins in
treating septic shock caused by free LPS molecules (also known as
endotoxins).14 The strong association of
polymyxins with LPS also explains the formation of rod-shaped projections
from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria when exposed to polymyxin
B.15 Although the exact mechanism underlying
polymyxin functioning against Gram-negative bacteria remains an open
question, impairment of the LPS layer is believed to play a crucial
role in initiating the bactericidal activity. Polymyxin binding will
cause the displacement of divalent cations that are important for
stabilizing the LPS layer by linking phosphates of neighboring LPS
molecules. A weakened LPS layer will allow more polymyxins (and other
solutes) to traverse the OM.16,17 The mechanism was coined
as the self-promoted uptake pathway.16 Collectively,
the first step of polymyxin functioning is to modify the structure
and organization of the LPS-enriched OM bilayer. Subsequent bactericidal
activity can be carried out by different mechanisms that are still
not fully understood. A few of the proposed bactericidal mechanisms
include the perforation of the cell wall,18 formation of molecular contacts between the OM and the cytoplasmic
membrane,19 loss of enzymatic components,20,21 and production of reactive oxygen species.22

To elucidate the effect of polymyxins on the OM bilayer, many
studies
have used LPS-containing vesicles or monolayers. Selective examples
include the following: (i) electron microscopy showed that colistin
disintegrated ribbon-like vesicular structures formed by isolated
LPS;23 (ii) electron spin resonance revealed
that polymyxin B had a large impact on the packing property of LPS;24 (iii) polymyxins inserted into LPS monolayers
at the air–water interface as evidenced by an increase in the
surface pressure;25,26 (iv) electrophysiological measurements
showed that polymyxin B induced electrically active lesions in LPS-containing
bilayers;27,28 and (v) nuclear magnetic resonance coupled
with computational modeling was used to predict the molecular binding
mode of polymyxin B and LPS molecules.29−31

In contrast to
the abundant studies of polymyxins interacting with
LPS in vesicular or monolayer systems, only a few reports of polymyxin–LPS
interactions in a planar bilayer setup have been made. A recent study
used LPS/phospholipid mixtures (and deep rough LPS) to prepare oriented
multilamellar stacks to mimic the OM bilayer; the authors then used
X-ray diffuse scattering to explore the effect of colistin on mechanical
properties of the LPS-containing bilayers.32 Here, we used liquid atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate
the effect of colistin on nanoscale topographic structures of LPS-containing
lipid bilayers. Our AFM-based study is motivated by the facts that
(i) AFM is a suitable technique to visually detect structural changes
of lipid bilayers induced by membrane-active compounds and (ii) only
two AFM-based studies have been reported on polymyxins interacting
with LPS; one study was performed on a lipid A monolayer33 and the other used biotinylated LPS to form
a monolayer supported by a densely packed avidin layer.34

In this paper, we first used vesicle leakage
experiment to study
changes in bilayer permeability caused by colistin. The obtained results
revealed that colistin-induced bilayer permeation was dependent on
the LPS fraction in LPS/phospholipid bilayers. We then used liquid
AFM to explore structural changes of planar lipid bilayers. Our AFM
measurements showed that the effect of colistin on bilayer topographic
structure was dependent on the LPS fraction and the peptide concentration.
Importantly, we observed nanoscale clusters that are consistent with
the complex formation of colistin and LPS molecules. The segregated
lipid clusters could produce membrane lesions (i.e., cluster edges)
that are consistent with our vesicle leakage data. We also found that
both bilayer permeabilization and cluster development were inhibited
by introducing magnesium ions into LPS-containing lipid bilayers.
Results from our vesicle leakage and liquid AFM experiments provided
useful insights into the mechanism that could be used by polymyxins
in impairing the permeability barrier of the OM of Gram-negative bacteria.

2 Materials and Methods
1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) was purchased from NOF America (purity >99%). Lipid stock
solutions
were prepared by dissolving lipid powders in organic solvents (chloroform
and methanol). Calcein disodium salt and lyophilized LPS powder were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. According to the vendor, LPS was phenol
extracted from P. aeruginosa. The source
strain is ATCC 27316. Colistin sulfate powder was purchased from Alfa
Aesar.

2.1 Vesicle Leakage Experiment
Dry lipid
films were prepared in glass test tubes by mixing appropriate ratios
of lipid stock solutions. Organic solvents were removed by a gentle
stream of nitrogen gas using a 12-position N-EVAP evaporator (Organomation
Associates, Inc., Berlin, MA). The samples were further dried by vacuum
pumping for ∼1 h. The obtained lipid films were hydrated in
30 mM calcein and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) at pH 7.4. For LPS-containing samples, an appropriate
amount of an LPS stock solution (in water) was mixed with lipid suspension
during the hydration process. We used a Qsonica cup-horn powered by
a Fisherbrand model 705 sonic dismembrator to prepare calcein-enclosed
unilamellar vesicles. The output power was 50% and the total sonication
time was 20 min (1 min on and 30 s off). External calcein was removed
by using an ÄKTA Pure (GE Healthcare) and a gel filtration
column (Superdex 200, 10/300GL). The running buffer contained 45 mM
NaCl and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4).

Colistin sulfate stock solution
was prepared in the running buffer (i.e., 45 mM NaCl and 10 mM HEPES
pH 7.4). To prepare vesicles treated with different concentrations
of colistin, we first mixed the colistin stock solution with the running
buffer to achieve different colistin concentrations (final volume
of 970 μL). Calcein-enclosed vesicle stock solution (30 μL)
was added to the prepared solution with different colistin concentrations.
To obtain maximum vesicle leakage, we substituted the colistin solution
with the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 (final concentration of
20 mM). The vesicle–colistin mixtures were incubated in the
dark for 20 h. The incubated samples were transferred to a quartz
cuvette. Fluorescence spectrum at 23 °C was obtained using an
FP-8300 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Analytical Instruments) and a Peltier
thermal cell holder (model EHC-813). The excitation wavelength was
494 ± 2.5 nm. The emission spectrum was measured from 500 to
600 nm (bandwidth of 2.5 nm). Three measurements were performed for
each sample. The maximum emission intensity at 515 nm was used for
vesicle leakage evaluation. Vesicle leakage % was calculated using
the following equation:  where I0 is the
fluorescence intensity of control vesicles, Imax is the fluorescence intensity of vesicles treated with
Triton X-100, and I is the fluorescence intensity
of vesicles treated with different concentrations of colistin.

2.2 Liquid AFM Experiment
Dry lipid films
were prepared by the same procedure as described for the leakage experiment.
An LPS stock solution was prepared in ultrapure water. To obtain LPS/POPC
mixtures with different weight ratios, an appropriate volume of the
LPS stock solution was added to the POPC film. The mixture was repeatedly
vortexed and sonicated using a bath sonicator. The lipid suspension
was later transferred to a 10 mL glass beaker. Additional ultrapure
water was added to the beaker, so the final volume was ∼5 mL.
Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were prepared using a Branson Ultrasonics
Sonifier SFX 250 and a 10 mm flat tip. The total sonication time was
5 min (30 s on and 30 s off). The obtained SUVs were briefly centrifuged
before bilayer preparation for AFM imaging.

We used the same
procedure for AFM measurements (room temperature) as has been reported
elsewhere.35−38 Briefly, we injected SUVs into an AFM liquid cell to prepare mica-supported
planar bilayers. After incubation of ∼15 min, we injected ultrapure
water to flush out SUVs that did not participate in bilayer formation.
AFM images were acquired using a Multimode 8 AFM (Bruker, Santa Barbara,
CA). The AFM mode we used is called the PeakForce quantitative nanomechanics
(QNM) mode. AFM height images were acquired using a DNP-S10 probe
with a scan rate of ∼1 Hz and a peak force of ∼400 pN.
After obtaining several images of the control bilayer, we then injected
a colistin solution with a specific concentration (in water). AFM
images of colistin-treated bilayers were acquired using the same procedure
as for the control bilayer. The obtained AFM images were leveled by
subtracting a polynomial background using in-house developed MATLAB
scripts.

3 Results
3.1 Vesicle
Leakage
We used fluorescence
spectroscopy to examine the effect of colistin on bilayer permeability.
Lipid vesicles were prepared at several LPS/POPC weight ratios. Note
that because the molecular weight of the isolated LPS is unknown,
we use weight ratios for LPS/POPC bilayers in this paper. Calcein-enclosed
lipid vesicles were prepared by gel filtration. Fluorescence signal
from control vesicles is small due to the self-quenching property
of the fluorophore (i.e., calcein). When colistin binds to lipid vesicles,
the resulting increase in the bilayer permeability will cause an increase
in the fluorescence signal. We have previously used this method to
evaluate changes in bilayer permeability caused by different compounds.38−40

Here, we used vesicle leakage to measure changes in the bilayer
permeability after incubating lipid vesicles with colistin for 20
h. The result is summarized in Figure 2. For the LPS-absent POPC vesicles, a maximum permeability
increase of ∼10% was observed. The addition of LPS at 1:100
yielded a maximum permeability of ∼30% (10 μM colistin).
A further increase of the LPS/POPC weight ratio to 1:30 and 1:10 resulted
in a maximum permeability of ∼55% (10 μM colistin). By
comparing the maximum leakage % for LPS/POPC bilayers with different
LPS fractions, we conclude that colistin-induced bilayer permeation
is dependent on the LPS fraction. In addition, because the maximum
leakage % is <100% for all LPS/POPC bilayers studied, we conjecture
that only a portion of the fluorophore molecules was released from
lipid vesicles even when the maximum leakage was achieved. This indicates
that colistin did not completely damage lipid vesicles as the surfactant
Triton X-100 would. Lastly, we examined the effect of divalent cationic
magnesium ions on bilayer permeabilization. This is done by preparing
LPS/POPC 1:30 vesicles with 5 mM MgCl2 both inside and
outside. Figure 2 shows
that the magnesium ions significantly suppressed the maximum leakage
% such that the LPS/POPC 1:30 vesicles suspended in 5 mM MgCl2 responded similarly to colistin as the POPC vesicles did.
Therefore, magnesium ions abrogated the effect of LPS in enhancing
bilayer permeabilization caused by colistin.

Figure 2 Vesicle leakage induced
by colistin as a function of the peptide
concentration. Vesicles were prepared at several weight ratios of
LPS/POPC. Vesicles with 5 mM MgCl2 both inside and outside
was used to examine the effect of magnesium ions. The measurements
were performed after incubating vesicles with colistin for 20 h. Leakage
of 0% corresponds to control vesicles, and leakage of 100% corresponds
to the treatment with 20 mM Triton X-100.

3.2 AFM Experiment on Planar Lipid Bilayers
We conducted liquid AFM measurements to visually detect nanoscale
structural changes of LPS/POPC bilayers induced by colistin. Figure 3 shows the AFM images
of an LPS/POPC 1:60 bilayer before and after exposure to 10 μM
colistin. The control bilayer exhibited a macroscopically homogeneous
organization. The smooth surface structure is also indicated by the
height profile along the bilayer surface (Figure 3c). After confirming the quality of the control
bilayer, we used a syringe pump to inject a 10 μM colistin solution. Figure 3b shows the modified
bilayer structure after exposure to 10 μM colistin. Numerous
small clusters with a length scale of ∼20 nm were observed.
Larger clusters with a length scale up to a few hundred nanometers
were also present at several locations. For simplicity, we will refer
to the smaller clusters as “nanoclusters”, and the larger
clusters as “macroclusters” or “clusters”.
AFM is sensitive to the bilayer normal dimension. The height profile
along an arbitrary path showed that the macroclusters have a height
of ∼2 nm above the background. The height of the nanoclusters
is not well-defined by the height profile because the path does not
always coincide with the center of the nanoclusters. Nevertheless,
the nanoclusters have a height of ∼1–2 nm as evidenced
by the height profile.

and after
(b) exposure to 10 μM colistin. Height scale is indicated by
the color at the bottom. The same color bar is used for all AFM images
in the paper. Scale bars are 200 nm. (c) Height profile along the
solid green lines in (a,b).

After obtaining the preliminary data of bilayer restructuring,
we are interested in the effect of the LPS fraction in regulating
colistin-induced lipid clustering. We used AFM imaging to explore
bilayer remodeling induced by colistin at two LPS fractions. Figure 4 shows the AFM images
of two LPS-containing bilayers (i.e., LPS/POPC of 1:60 and 1:30) before
and after treatment with 10 μM colistin. Dispersed clusters
with a length scale of a few hundred nanometers were observed for
the LPS/POPC 1:60 bilayer (Figure 4b) (note that Figures 4b and 3b are similar except
for the image sizes. The nanoclusters in Figure 3b are not distinguishable in Figure 4b.) Increasing the LPS fraction
to 1:30 caused a marked increase in the number of the macroclusters
(Figure 4d). Despite
the striking difference in their numbers, macroclusters in both bilayers
had a height of ∼2 nm. Collectively, our AFM experiment on
two LPS/POPC bilayers with varying LPS fractions showed that the degree
of lipid clustering induced by colistin is positively correlated with
the fraction of LPS in LPS/POPC bilayers.

an LPS/POPC 1:60 bilayer before (a) and after
(b) exposure to 10 μM colistin; liquid AFM images of an LPS/POPC
1:30 bilayer before (c) and after (d) exposure to 10 μM colistin.
Height scale is 5 nm. Scale bars are 1 μm.

Next, we examined the effect of the peptide concentration
in mediating
colistin–bilayer interactions. We used an LPS/POPC 1:30 bilayer
as the control system—AFM image of the control bilayer is the
same as Figure 4c.
Exposure of the control bilayer to 5 μM colistin caused the
formation of many macroclusters (Figure 5a). The number of macroclusters increased
significantly when the peptide concentration was increased to 10 μM
(Figure 5b). Note that
the cluster height is similar at the two peptide concentrations. Altogether,
our AFM measurements of an LPS/POPC bilayer showed that the number
of macroclusters induced by colistin is proportional to the peptide
concentration.

Figure 5 Liquid AFM images of an LPS/POPC 1:30 bilayer exposed
to 5 (a)
and 10 μM (b) colistin. Height scale is 5 nm. Scale bars are
1 μm.

Lastly, we investigated
the effect of magnesium ions on colistin-induced
bilayer remodeling. The control bilayer of LPS/POPC 1:30 was prepared
from SUVs in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2. AFM image showed
that the control bilayer had a few small spots likely caused by magnesium
ion induced LPS aggregation (Figure 6a). Exposing the control bilayer to 5 μM colistin
in conjugation with 5 mM MgCl2 did not result in marked
changes in the bilayer structure, although the number of small spots
increased moderately (Figure 6b). Notice that the small spots in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 had a different morphology compared to the nanoclusters in Figure 3b. Moreover, no macroclusters
were observed in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 (Figure 6b). Overall, by comparing Figures 5a and 6b (the same bilayer composition and peptide concentration),
we conclude that magnesium ions inhibited the effect of colistin in
inducing lipid clustering in LPS-containing bilayers.

an LPS/POPC 1:30 bilayer in 5 mM MgCl2 before (a) and after
(b) exposure to 5 μM colistin.

4 Discussion
In this study, we used fluorescence
spectroscopy and liquid AFM
to interrogate the effect of colistin on membrane permeability and
nanoscale structures. We are particularly interested in the relationship
between the content of the OM-specific LPS and the degree of membrane
restructuring induced by colistin. Our vesicle leakage experiment
showed that colistin binding impaired the permeability barrier of
LPS-containing lipid vesicles. The maximum leakage % was found to
increase with the fraction of LPS. Addition of the divalent cationic
magnesium ions inhibited the effect of LPS in enhancing bilayer permeabilization
caused by colistin. We used liquid AFM to determine the impact of
colistin on nanoscale structures of LPS-containing lipid bilayers.
The AFM experiment revealed that colistin caused a marked change in
bilayer topography as evidenced by the formation of nano- and macroclusters.
We found that the degree of lipid clustering was dependent on the
LPS fraction; more extensive lipid clustering was observed in lipid
bilayers containing a larger fraction of LPS. In addition, more clusters
were formed at higher peptide concentrations. Lastly, magnesium ions
were found to antagonize lipid clustering induced by colistin.

We used a mixture of LPS and phospholipids to prepare vesicular
and planar lipid bilayers. Our choice of the lipid composition was
based on several considerations. First, it has been shown that LPS/phospholipid
bilayers are suitable for evaluating antimicrobial peptide–LPS
interactions.41 Second, there is no experimental
evidence to definitively prove that the outer monolayer of the OM
is exclusively composed of LPS.7,42 Interestingly, deep
rough LPS was reported to coexist with phospholipids in the outer
monolayer of the OM in Gram-negative bacterial mutants.43 Third, the antibacterial activity of polymyxins
is correlated with the content (and the chemical structure) of LPS.
Complete loss of LPS was reported to serve as a mechanism for developing
polymyxin resistance by A. baumannii.44 Similarly, LPS in cell wash solution
was found to reduce the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to colistin.45 Collectively, studies
of colistin interacting with LPS/phospholipid bilayers are useful
to reveal the mechanism of OM permeation caused by polymyxins.

Owing to their opposite charge states, colistin and LPS can form
stoichiometric complexes.10,46 The strong binding
affinities of polymyxins to LPS have been broadly demonstrated by
using fluorophore-tagged polymyxins.12,13 There are
two driving forces directing the recognition of polymyxins toward
LPS. The initial binding is facilitated by long-range electrostatic
interactions between the negatively charged phosphates of LPS and
the positively charged DAB of polymyxins. After initial binding, hydrophobic
interactions between the hydrophobic tails of the lipid A motif of
LPS and the hydrophobic domains of polymyxins can further increase
the binding affinity of the peptides. Many efforts have been made
to elucidate the complex structure of polymyxins binding to LPS at
a molecular level. A comprehensive summarization can be found in the
review work by Velkov and co-workers.47 In essence, the polycationic heptapeptide ring of polymyxins resides
in the vicinity of the interface between the lipid A motif and the
oligosaccharide core, whereas the acyl tail of polymyxins penetrates
into the hydrophobic core of LPS. The proposed complex models are
in line with the electrostatic and hydrophobic driving forces in stabilizing
the binding of polymyxins to LPS. Unlike polyanionic LPS, zwitterionic
phospholipids have a weak association with polymyxins.48−51

The distinctive binding affinities of colistin to LPS and
POPC
are likely responsible for the nano- and macroclusters observed in
our AFM experiment. Our observation of lipid clustering has some similarity
to an earlier study, which used a monolayer formed by Escherichia coli total extract (no LPS).52 Although their AFM experiment was performed
in air, the authors obtained circular protrusions (height of ∼1
nm) with a radius of 20 or 120 nm, depending on the concentration
of polymyxin B. Another study using fluorescence polarization also
reported domain formation of polymyxin B and phosphatidic acid in
the presence of phosphatidylcholine.53 To
explain the clusters observed in our AFM experiments, we propose a
schematic model of colistin bound to an LPS/POPC bilayer (Figure 7). The insertion
of colistin causes lipid redistribution such that LPS and colistin
segregate away from POPC to form isolated clusters. The cluster and
the POPC patch have a height difference of ∼2 nm because of
the bulky macrocyclic ring of colistin (and the ordered oligosaccharide
core of LPS). The probability of cluster formation is larger at higher
LPS contents (and colistin concentrations). Therefore, the proposed
model is in line with our observation of lipid clustering as a function
of the LPS fraction (and the peptide concentration). Magnesium ions
have a strong binding affinity to LPS.11 Introduction of magnesium ions will competitively inhibit the binding
of colistin to LPS.54 Consequently, magnesium
ions will reduce the development of LPS–colistin clusters (Figure 6).

Figure 7 Schematic diagram depicting
the proposed mechanism of colistin-induced
clustering of LPS molecules in mica-supported planar bilayers. The
insertion of colistin into the LPS/POPC bilayer causes a lateral redistribution
of the LPS molecules. LPS-enriched clusters are formed by electrostatic
interactions between colistin and LPS. The protrusion of colistin
macrocyclic ring (and LPS oligosaccharide core) could account for
the 2 nm height of the clusters observed in AFM imaging. Owing to
the discontinuity between the cluster and the rest of the bilayer,
solutes will have a larger probability of permeating through the cluster
edge. The model also predicts that bilayer permeability is positively
correlated with the total length of the cluster perimeter.

Our vesicle leakage experiment showed that colistin
increased the
permeability of LPS/POPC bilayers; the maximum leakage % increased
with the LPS fraction. Membrane perforation is a popular mechanism
proposed for the bactericidal activity of polymyxins. LPS tends to
decrease bilayer permeability by having a tighter packing of acyl
chains.55 Permeability enhancement of LPS-containing
bilayers (including the OM) can be achieved by pore formation or an
alteration in lipid packing.16,42,56 On the basis of electrophysiological measurements, Seydel and co-workers
proposed pore-like lesions induced by polymyxins in asymmetric LPS
bilayers.27,28 Our high-resolution AFM imaging did not
show transmembrane pores induced by colistin. Note that we have previously
observed <10 nm-sized pores using the same AFM setup.57 Instead of transmembrane pores, we argue that
the hypothetical lesions could correspond to cluster edges proposed
in our lipid clustering model. Owing to the discontinuity (and the
height mismatch) at the edge of LPS–colistin clusters, solutes
will have a larger probability of permeating through the cluster edge.
The total length of the cluster perimeter increases with the LPS fraction.
Therefore, our lipid clustering model can account for the leakage
behavior as a function of the LPS fraction in LPS/POPC vesicles. Because
magnesium ions inhibited cluster development (Figure 6), the probability of solutes permeating
through cluster edges is significantly reduced. Therefore, our lipid
clustering model also supports the role of magnesium ions in abrogating
colistin-induced bilayer permeabilization.

5 Conclusions
Here, we report the effect of cyclic lipopeptide colistin on membrane
permeability and nanoscale structures of LPS-containing lipid bilayers.
Fluorescence spectroscopy based vesicle leakage experiment revealed
that colistin binding impaired bilayer integrity, leading to an enhancement
of the bilayer permeability. The maximum increase in the bilayer permeability
was positively correlated with the LPS fraction in LPS/phospholipid
bilayers. Addition of the divalent cationic magnesium ions suppressed
the effect of LPS in enhancing bilayer permeabilization. We used liquid
AFM to gain a structural perspective of colistin-induced membrane
remodeling. We found that colistin caused the formation of nano- and
macroclusters that protruded from the bilayer by ∼2 nm. Moreover,
cluster development was enhanced by increasing the fraction of LPS
or colistin concentration but abolished by magnesium ions. To explain
our experimental data, we propose a lipid clustering model where LPS
and colistin form large-scale clusters that are segregated from the
POPC patch. The discontinuity (and the thickness mismatch) at the
cluster edge will create a passage that allows solutes to permeate
through. The degree of bilayer permeation is proportional to the total
length of the cluster perimeter. Because more clusters are formed
at higher LPS contents, our lipid clustering model supports the vesicle
leakage data.
