Marine
cyanobacteria are renowned for producing bioactive secondary
metabolites with great structural diversity via mixed biosynthetic
pathways. Lyngbya sp., a marine cyanobacterium,
produces many metabolites with anti-inflammatory potentials; nevertheless,
its bioactive metabolites exercising providing protection against
inflammation has been deciphered inadequate. In this study, the ethanolic
fraction of the Lyngbya sp. extract
was purified and identified as sodium 10-amino-2-methoxyundecanoate
(SAM) using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron spray ionization-mass spectroscopy. SAM showed prominent inhibition of inflammation, which was
analyzed by reactive oxygen species generation and nitric oxide (NO)
inhibition assay. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory potentials of SAM were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW
264.7 macrophage cell lines by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis, which evidenced prominent decrease in COX-2 expression (∼90%)
with SAM-treated cells than the control. Subsequently,
a semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis also
revealed the downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, NF-κß, IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, and IL-6 gene expression in SAM-treated LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. To further enhance the delivery
of SAM into the cells, it was combined with N-doped graphene
quantum dots (N-GQDs) for the anti-inflammatory potentials. It resulted
in improved downregulation of COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, NF-κß, IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, and IL-6 than cells treated with SAM alone. Conclusively, N-GQDs combined with SAM have
the effective therapeutic potential as an inhibitor of inflammation
by modulating the expression of different cytokine genes.

1 Introduction
Noncommunicable
diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis,
cardiovascular disease, asthma, and bronchitis are caused by inflammation.1 Macrophages play a vital role in signalling of
inflammatory pathways and secrete cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β,
IL-4, IL-6, NF-κß, and TNF-α) and immune modulators
including nitric oxide (NO) and cyclooxygenase (COX). The enzymes
COX-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are mainly involved
in the development of numerous inflammatory diseases.2 Hence, for targeting the expression of the above said enzymes,
many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used
as therapeutic drugs to inhibit the COX synthesis, which is involved
in the prostaglandin biosynthesis. COX exists in two isoforms such
as COX-1 (constitutive isoform) and COX-2 (inducible isoform). COX-2
specifically induces inflammation by macrophage cells, but its induction
in normal tissues is undetectable, whereas COX-1 is constitutively
expressed in normal human tissues.3 COX-1
is mainly responsible for producing physiological levels of prostaglandins
to maintain housekeeping functions.4 COX-2
is induced after the proinflammatory cytokine stimulation for the
production of prostaglandins, and thus, the inhibitors selectively
required to reduce the amount of COX-2 to provide anti-inflammatory
action should be more effective than the commonly used NSAIDs.5

Marine microorganisms are the natural,
richest source for bioactive
compounds that can be used to develop new therapeutics in the pharmaceutical
industry because of their therapeutic potentials as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
and antimicrobial agents and anticancer activity in humans.6 Among the marine organisms, cyanobacteria Lyngbya sp. are known to form bloom in the marine
habitat and produce a harmful environment.7 However, their secondary metabolites have been reported to have
a wide scope of biological activities.8 Interestingly, the genera Lyngbya alone produces a large number of bioactive molecules9 among which only few of their potentials were well explored
and several products still remain unexplored. Lyngbya sp. isolated from the marine environment possesses enzymes involved
in the nonribosomal polyketide synthetase and polyketide synthetase
pathways, which are the vital indicators of production of a variety
of secondary metabolites.10,11

In recent years,
demand for the synthesis of fluorescent nanomaterials
alternative to traditional dyes gained huge attention.12 In contrast to organic dyes, these nanomaterials
have quantum size effect and overcome many shortcomings like low stability,
weak fluorescence, and poor solubility in water.13 Among the different fluorescent nanomaterials to date,
graphene quantum dots (GQDs) received huge interest because of their
low toxicity, high photochemical stability, and excellent solubility
in water.14 Because of these interesting
properties, they are used in a variety of applications including bioimaging,
catalysis, sensors, and solar cells. Subsequently, GQDs doped with
heteroatoms, in particular nitrogen-doped GQDs (N-GQDs), have been
actively investigated in recent years because of their optical and
surface features.15 The doping of nitrogen
provides large surface area to adsorb the analyte molecules because
the surface energy of the system can be reduced by the doped nitrogen
atoms ingrained in the lattice. It has been already demonstrated that
GQDs have excellent low toxicity and are biocompatible agents for
labeling stem cells.16 In addition to GQDs,
the cytotoxicity of N-GQDs and graphene oxide (GO) for red blood cells
is also studied. It was found that N-GQDs have much lower toxicity
than GO.17 The N-GQDs have important features
such as splendid water solubility, photostability, excitation dependent
fluorescence, excellent biocompatibility, and high cell permeability.
Because of such kinds of fascinating properties, N-GQDs can be used
in biosensing, bioimaging, drug delivery, and other biological applications.13,18,19

Thus, in nutshell, this
study is aimed to investigate on the structural
elucidation and characterization of bioactive compounds from Lyngbya sp. using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electron spray ionization-mass
spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and to explore their anti-inflammatory action
through inhibition of different cytokine expression in RAW 264.7 cell
lines stimulated with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Further, the efficient
delivery of compounds was improved by N-GQDs in macrophage cell lines.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Identification of Cyanobacteria
The
morphology of Lyngbya sp. was observed
under the light microscope, and it appeared as bluish-green long filamentous,
segmented, and straight or somewhat wavelike filaments, which were
about 40 μm wide with discrete visible, solid, and colorless
sheaths (Figure 1).
The morphological features were also similar to the features of the
genera Lyngbya sp. that was already
reported.20

(40×) and (b) autofluorescence microscopy
images of Lyngbya sp. at the emission
range of 400–500 nm under a fluorescence microscope.

2.2 Extraction
and Separation of the Compound
from Lyngbya sp.
The dried
sample of Lyngbya sp. (100 g) was used
to extract the compound that was then separated using silica gel column
chromatography with a hexane–ethanol–methanol gradient.
The total dry weight of the ethanolic fraction of the separated bioactive
compound was 6.4 mg/mL after column purification, which was used further
for structural elucidation.

2.3 Structural Elucidation
of the Bioactive Compound
from Lyngbya sp.
The pure
ethanolic fraction containing a single compound was characterized
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and FT-IR spectroscopy
which revealed the presence of various functional groups appearing
at different wave numbers (Figure S1).
The functional groups present in the compound showed similarity to
the known malyngamides and lyngbic acid derivatives.21 Further, for the elucidation and confirmation of the molecular
structure of this purified compound, a NMR measurement was performed.
The 1H NMR spectrum for the purified compound is shown
in Figure S2, and the obtained peaks and
their assignments are given in Table S1. The appearance of a singlet peak at 3.47 ppm indicates the presence
of the −OCH3 group. The broad signal at 4.13 ppm
corresponds to the NH2 group. The peak at 2.31 ppm is due
to a C–H proton of the ester and methoxy-attached carbon. Another
C–H peak appears at 1.99 ppm. At 0.85 ppm, the appearance of
a doublet peak indicates that the −CH3 group was
attached with one of the −CH groups. The CH3 group
may be attached with the carbon bearing either the amine or methoxy
group. The peak at 1.25 ppm corresponds to 10 protons at a similar
environment. This is possible only if the five CH2 groups
are present in a continuous manner. There is one CH2 group
merged with the huge peak at 1.12 and this should correspond to C-3
protons. If the amine group is present in the C-2 position, it should
form an intramolecular hydrogen bond. In such a case, the peak would
be shifted to 8–10 ppm (deshielding). However, that peak appeared
at 4.13 ppm, indicating that the NH2 group was present
at the C-10 position, with carbon possessing a methyl group (C-11).
We have also carried out two-dimensional (2D) NMR (Figure S3) to confirm the position of the amine group. The
electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS spectrum) (Figure S4) revealed the mass of the compound,
sodium 10-amino-2-methoxyundecanoate (SAM), to be 253.09.
On the basis of the above results, the structure was elucidated as SAM (Figure S5).

2.4 Effect of SAM in the NO Scavenging
Assay
NO is produced by various cell types, which plays a
key function during inflammation, where macrophages induce the expression
of proinflammatory genes like iNOS through cytokines and produce NO.
iNOS is generally responsible for sustained NO production at higher
levels. NO functions as a host defence molecule which is toxic to
infectious agents and may induce adverse reactions that could cause
damage to other tissues of the host itself.22 The regulation of NO production serves as an important therapeutic
target against inflammatory diseases. In this study, the cells treated
with SAM affected NO production and exhibiting noticeable NO scavenging
activity (IC50 value 117.98 ± 0.41 μg/mL) that
prevents the induced inflammatory response.

2.5 Anti-Inflammatory
Activity of SAM in RAW 264.7 Cell Lines
2.5.1 Cell Cytotoxicity Assay
The cytotoxic
effect of SAM was determined at different concentrations
(5–100 μg/mL) on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell lines.
The result of this analysis demonstrated that there was no effect
of SAM on cell viability up to 24 h (Figure S7). Therefore, 100 μg/mL of SAM was nontoxic, which was further used for the study of COX-2 expression.

2.5.2 Assay for COX-2 Expression Using Fluorescence-Activated
Cell Sorting in RAW 264.7 Cell Lines Treated with SAM
In vitro tests were designed using fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis to substantiate the interaction of SAM with COX-2 using LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cell lines,
and interestingly, it was found that SAM exhibited pronounced
anti-inflammatory activity. It was found already that SAM was noncytotoxic when tested with various concentrations (5–100
μg/mL) on RAW 264.7 cell lines. Hence, the nontoxic concentration
(100 μg/mL) of SAM was further used to study the
anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines that
were stained using a COX-2-specific primary antibody with Alexa Fluor
488-labeled goat antimouse IgG (H + L) fluorescent secondary antibody
to measure COX-2 expression by FACS analysis. The results showed upregulation
of COX-2 expression (31.1%) in the RAW 264.7 cell lines which are
challenged with LPS, whereas a remarkable decrease in the COX-2 expression
was evidenced when the cells were treated with SAM (2.8%),
which is almost equal to control RAW cell lines uninduced with LPS
(2.1%) (Figure 2).
Thus, the treatment with SAM clearly witnessed decreased
COX-2 expression by in vitro model RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) is produced by COX-2 at the inflammatory site,
which is an important mediator of inflammation. PGE2 production
and induction of COX-2 activity are related to NO production.23 Thus, SAM could be a persuasive
compound in preventing COX-2 expression for prospecting as a therapeutic
in treating the diseases caused by inflammatory response like Alzheimer’s
disease, cancer, and arthritis.

lines induced with LPS by
using FACS.

2.6 Characterization
of N-GQDs by UV–Visible,
Fluorescence, and Transmission Electron Microscopy Techniques
The synthesis of N-GQDs using citric acid and l-asparagine
by pyrolysis is schematically shown in Scheme 1. The UV–vis spectra of N-GQDs and SAM are shown in Figure 3A. N-GQDs show the absorption maximum at 335 nm, corresponding
to n−π* transition because of the presence of surface
functional groups such as hydroxyl, amino, and carboxylate (Figure 3A). On the other
hand, SAM showed the absorption peaks at 270 and 403
nm, corresponding to π–π* and n−π*
transitions, respectively. Figure 3B shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
image of N-GQDs. It shows that the N-GQDs were spherical, and the
size was found to be ∼3 nm. The N-GQDs showed blue luminescence
under UV light. While varying the excitation wavelength, only the
emission intensity varies but the emission maximum remains constant.
This observation revealed that the size and surface states of as-synthesized
N-GQDs were uniform and showed the maximum emission intensity at 440
nm when exciting at 355 nm.

(a) N-GQDs and (b) SAM. (B) TEM image of N-GQDs.

Scheme 1 Scheme Showing the Synthesis of N-GQDs
by the Pyrolysis Method
The FT-IR spectrum of SAM (Figure 4a) showed a peak at 3360 cm–1 corresponding to N–H stretching vibration.
The −C–H
asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations appeared at 2980 and
2894 cm–1, respectively. The corresponding bending
vibration peak appeared at 874 cm–1. The peak due
to carbonyl stretching appeared at 1657 cm–1. The
C–N stretching peak of SAM appeared at 1491 cm–1. The peak at 1401 cm–1 was due
to C–O stretching. The corresponding CH2 rocking
vibration peak appeared at 1259 cm–1. The −C–O–C–
stretching vibration peak appeared at 1040 cm–1.
The FT-IR spectrum of N-GQDs (Figure 4b) revealed that the broad band at 3436 cm–1 corresponds to −O–H and −N–H stretching
vibrations. The peak at 2931 cm–1 was ascribed to
the C–H stretching of N-GQDs. The peak at 1635 cm–1 indicates the presence of −C=O stretching. The peak
corresponding to −C–N stretching appeared at 1497 cm–1. The −C–O bending and −C–O–C–
stretching vibrations appeared at 1414 and 1080 cm–1, respectively. These results indicated that the formed GQDs had
hydroxyl, amine, and carbonyl functional groups in the surface of
N-GQDs. The FT-IR spectrum recorded for a mixture of SAM and N-GQDs is shown in Figure 4c. The different stretching peaks corresponding to
N-GQDs and SAM appeared with a slight shift. In contrast
to N-GQDs, the broad peak corresponding to −O–H and
−N–H stretching vibration was shifted to 3420 cm–1. The peaks due to −C=O stretching and
−C–O–C– stretching vibrations were shifted
to 1638, 1406, and 1010 cm–1, respectively. The
obtained shift in the different stretching frequencies is mainly due
to the possible hydrogen bonding interaction between amine, carbonyl,
and hydroxyl groups of N-GQDs and SAM.

Effect of SAM Combined with N-GQDs in Macrophage RAW
264.7 Cell Lines
2.7.1 Studies of N-GQD Fluorescence
Inside RAW
264.7 Cell Lines by Live Cell Imaging
The emission spectra
of N-GQDs with various concentrations of SAM are shown
in Figure 5A. N-GQDs
showed the emission maximum at 440 nm at an excitation of 355 nm.
With the addition of various concentrations of SAM (each
0.1 mL addition), a systematic decrease in the emission intensity
of N-GQDs was observed. After the addition of 1 mL of SAM, the emission intensity of N-GQDs was completely quenched (Figure 5A). The N-GQDs contain
amide, amine, carboxyl, and hydroxyl as surface functional groups.
These surface functional groups would have interacted with the surface
functional groups of SAM (amine, hydroxyl, and carboxyl)
through hydrogen bonding, which results in the nonradiative emission
process through energy transfer. The fluorescence quenching of N-GQDs
after the addition of SAM was explained by fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. The mechanism of FRET
involves a donor fluorophore in an excited electronic state, which
may transfer its excitation energy to a nearby acceptor chromophore
in a nonradiative fashion through long-range dipole–dipole
interactions. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the donor molecule
must overlap the absorption or excitation spectrum of the acceptor
chromophore. This is an important criterion for FRET to occur.24 As shown in Figure S6, the absorption spectrum of SAM overlaps with the emission
spectrum of N-GQDs. This indicates that the FRET process exists in
the fluorescence quenching phenomena. Further, this was confirmed
by performing time-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements of
N-GQDs in the absence and presence of SAM. It is evident
from Figure 5B that
the lifetime (τ) of N-GQDs (τ1 = 9.747 ns)
shows a significant change (τ2 = 9.041 ns) after
the addition of 1 mg/mL SAM. This result further confirmed
that the FRET process is involved in the fluorescence quenching of
N-GQDs.

The binding constant (KA) value can be calculated by using
the double logarithm equation.25  where, F0 is the fluorescence intensity
of N-GQDs alone and F is the fluorescence intensity
of N-GQDs with SAM, KA is
the binding constant and n is the number of binding
sites, and [Q] represents the
concentration of SAM. The values for KA and n can be derived from the intercept
and slope, respectively. From Figure S8, KA and n values were
calculated as KA = 8.841 × 104 M–1 and 0.5926, respectively, suggesting
the presence of a strong interaction between N-GQDs and SAM. The schematic representation showing the fluorescence quenching
of N-GQDs in the presence of SAM is shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Schematic Representation
for the Fluorescence Quenching of N-GQDs
by SAM
Live cell imaging was performed to analyze the fluorescence
intensity
of SAM and N-GQDs by high content screening (HCS). Similarly, SAM alone treated cell lines did not show fluorescence, which
demonstrated the quenching property of SAM to N-GQDs.
These results evidenced that the compound was delivered effectively
into the RAW 264.7 cell line; it might be because of the interaction
between the functional groups of SAM and N-GQDs (Figure 6). Further, changes
in the morphology of RAW 264.7 cell lines were also noticed (Figure 6). The LPS-induced
untreated cells were irregular in shape with pseudopodia, whereas
N-GQDs + SAM and SAM alone LPS-induced treated
cells showed a round shape morphology because of the suppression in
the formation of pseudopodia by inhibiting the cell differentiation.26 Hence, the results are evidencing that SAM may act as a prominent drug for the treatment of the inflammatory
diseases and that it can be delivered very effectively with the N-GQDs
for better availability of SAM into the cells.

RAW 264.7 cell lines under different conditions. (Control

2.8 Anti-Inflammatory
Activity of SAM along with N-GQDs in RAW 264.7 Cell Lines
2.8.1 Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen
Species
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are very important
inflammatory mediators. During inflammation, ROS can cause potential
number of deleterious events like DNA damage and mutation.27,28 ROS are involved in various gene expressions related to inflammation
by redox-based activation of NF-κß and the COX-2 signalling
pathway. The effects of SAM and SAM + N-GQDs
on ROS were determined by treating LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines
by 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Figure 7). ROS generation in LPS-induced RAW 264.7
cells showed a significant increase (p < 0.01),
whereas in SAM + N-GQDs treated cells, ROS generation
had shown a more significant decrease in comparison to SAM alone (p < 0.05). Thus, the effective delivery
of SAM + N-GQDs had resulted in the inhibition of ROS
production.

in RAW 264.7 cell lines induced by LPS (*p < 0.05
& **p < 0.01). (Control = control group; LPS-induced

N-GQDs = LPS-induced treated with N-GQDs; SAM + N-GQDs
= LPS-induced treated with SAM + N-GQDs and SAM = LPS-induced treated with SAM alone).

2.8.2 NO Inhibition Assay
NO is a signalling
molecule which is synthesized by NOS which is a proinflammatory enzyme.
NO exerts inflammatory effects by stimulating COX-2 and iNOS.29 Excessive production of NO can cause inflammatory
diseases by stimulating COX-2 or iNOS. The effect of SAM and SAM + N-GQDs on NO yield was tested in RAW 264.7
cell lines after LPS induction. NO yield significantly increased in
LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines, whereas the level of NO yield was
most significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in LPS-induced
treated with SAM + N-GQDs in comparison to SAM alone treated cells. SAM alone treated cells showed
a significant decrease in the production of NO (Figure 8). These results clearly showed the better
inhibition of NO by SAM + N-GQDs in comparison to phlorotannins
extracted from edible brown algae Eisenia bicycles.30

2.8.3 Effects of Combined SAM and
N-GQDs Compound on LPS-Induced IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6,
COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, and NF-κß mRNA Expressions in
RAW 264.7 Cell Lines
Cytokines are small nonstructural proteins
(8–40 kDa) which regulate host responses to infection and inflammation.
These cytokines are involved in cell trafficking during inflammation
in the immune organs. Immune response is developed by the secretion
of cytokines by triggering cell-mediated, cytotoxic, or humoral immunity
response. Nevertheless, many cytokines have both potentials, proinflammatory
and anti-inflammatory. Major proinflammatory cytokines IL-1α
and IL-1ß, which triggers identical biological response, and
IL-6 and TNF-α promote the state of inflammation.31−33 IL-1 and TNF-α induce a variety of proinflammatory genes,
such as phospholipase A2, COX-2, iNOS, NF-κß,34 and other cytokines and chemokines.31,35,36 IL-4 is the only proinflammatory
cytokine that is induced at early stages of colonic injury in the
gut of mice.37

In the semiquantitative
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR), RAW 264.7
cell lines were stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL) and treated with SAM and combined with N-GQDs to analyze IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6, COX-2,
iNOS, TNF-α, and NF-κß
gene expressions, and it was found that LPS-induced inflammation in
RAW 264.7 cell lines causes upregulation of many modulators involved
in the inflammatory cascade. In semiquantitative PCR, SAM was given as the treatment to LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines and
a significant downregulation of IL-1α, IL-1ß, and IL-4 (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) was observed
(Figure 9). A slight
decrease was also seen in the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, NF-κß, and iNOS. However, the combination of SAM with N-GQDs had shown
downregulation in all of the eight genes, whereas a significant downregulation
was observed in the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-4, and IL-1ß. It is noteworthy to mention that the combination of SAM and N-GQDs proved to be a more effective inhibition in
the expression of IL-1α, IL-4, and IL-1ß (Figure 10). In RT-PCR, SAM showed that
there was a significant downregulation in the expression of the inflammatory
genes, whereas SAM + N-GQDs showed more a significant
decrease in the expression of IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, and IL-6 in comparison to COX-2, TNF-α, NF-κß, and iNOS genes (Figure 11).

Figure 9 Gene expression study
of the inflammatory genes (COX-2, TNF-α,
iNOS, NF-κß, IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, and IL-6) was
carried out by using semiquantitative PCR. (Control = control group;

3 Conclusions
Conclusively,
this study evidences the presence of SAM in Lyngbya sp., which has effective
biological potential against inflammation; it has been explored for
the first time. The bioactive metabolite SAM combined
with N-GQDs exhibited the effective downregulation of COX-2,
TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1ß, and IL-4 expression in LPS-challenged RAW
264.7 macrophage cell lines. Thus, it is apparent that SAM could serve as a promising natural therapeutic molecule for alleviating
the complications of inflammatory diseases. N-GQDs proved as a good
drug delivery molecule for enhancing the availability of the bioactive
compound SAM into the cells.

4 Methods
4.1 Algal Sample Collection and Identification
The cyanobacteria
samples were collected from Gulf of Mannar, Rameshwaram,
Tamil Nadu, India. The samples were identified based on morphological
characteristics as described earlier by Rippka et al. (1979).20 The dimension of the cyanobacterial isolate
was measured using a compound light microscope (Eppendorf, Germany)
with a 40× nonimmersion objective and ocular lens (10×)
with a calibrated optical micrometer. The samples were washed with
sea water and air-dried at room temperature 27 °C followed by
drying at 45 °C in a hot air oven for 60 min and frozen with
methanol until further extraction.

4.2 Extraction
and Separation of the Compound
from Lyngbya sp.
The freeze-dried
cyanobacterial samples (100 g) were lyzed by liquid nitrogen and then
kept in methanol/chloroform (ratio 1:2) at room temp (27 ± 1
°C) overnight and extracted using a Whatman filter paper. Further,
the extract was separated using silica gel (mesh size 230–400)
by column chromatography using 100% hexane–ethanol–methanol
gradient.

purity of the compound, reversed phase-HPLC analytical method was
carried out using a RP-HPLC (Shimadzu, Japan) system in a binary mode,
coupled to a UV detector, where 20 μL the purified fraction
was injected into a C-18 column. The mobile phase used for this experiment
was HPLC grade methanol: water (0.2 v/v %) at a ratio of 80:20 delivered
at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, and a detector was set at 250 nm. Further,
FT-IR (Shimadzu, Japan) spectra were also analyzed to identify functional
groups of the purified fractions. Further, NMR spectra were also recorded
on a Bruker AVANCE DRX300 spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany).
The spectra were referenced to a residual solvent signal with resonances
at δH/C 7.26/77.1 (CDCl3). Low-resolution ESI-MS
spectra were obtained on a Thermo Finnigan LCQ Advantage mass spectrometer
(Thermo Finnigan, USA). The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence
measurements were carried out using an Edinburg, FLS980 spectrofluorimeter.

4.4 Biological Activities of the Compound SAM
4.4.1 NO Radical Scavenging Assay of the Ethanolic
Compound
To check the in vitro anti-inflammatory activity,
the NO scavenging potential of SAM was assayed according
to Tsai et al. (1997).38 The quantities
of nitrate or nitrite can be determined by using Griess reagent.39 Briefly, serially diluted 60 μL of SAM was mixed with sodium nitroprusside (10 mM) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) added into a 96-well plate and further incubated at 28
°C under illumination for 2 h. NO reacts with oxygen and produces
nitrate or nitrite that can be quantified after the addition of Griess
reagent at the absorption maximum of 540 nm. Ascorbic acid was used
as the standard, and the NO scavenging effect of the compound was
calculated by the given formula  where A0 and A1 are the absorbances of the control and sample
reaction, respectively.

4.5 Studies
of the Anti-Inflammatory Activity
of SAM Using RAW 264.7 Cell Lines
4.5.1 Cell
Culture and Cell Cytotoxicity Activity
The RAW 264.7 cell
line was procured from National Centre for Cell
Sciences (NCCS) Pune, India. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) along with 1% antibiotics and incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The RAW 264.7 cell lines were grown
in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS, and 1 × 104 cells/well
were seeded into a 96-well plate and further incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. The cells were then treated with different concentrations
(10–100 μL of SAM). After incubation (24
h), 10 μL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide was added to the wells and mixed properly and incubated for
2 h. After 2 h of incubation, solubilizing buffer was added into the
wells and the absorbance of the resultant color was measured at 570
nm using an ELISA reader (BioTek, US).

4.5.2 Assay
for COX-2 Expression by FACS Analysis
The cells (1 ×
106 cells/well) were plated in a
6-well plate and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
antibiotic in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C to analyze
the effect of SAM on the expression of COX-2 using RAW
264.7 cell lines. After preincubation for 1 h, with SAM, which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, LPS (1 μg/mL)
was added and incubated for 12 h. Uninduced and untreated cells served
as the control for the expression of COX-2. After the incubation,
PBS was used to wash the cells, trypsinized, and fixed with 70% ethanol.
All of the RAW 264.7 cell lines were washed using bovine serum albumin
(BSA; 5 mg/mL) and were further pelleted. The primary antibody COX-2
(Santa Cruz F2513, USA) was provided in a dilution (1:2500) to the
pellet and then kept for 30 min incubation in dark. The secondary
antibody Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti mouse IgG (H + L) 1 in 5000 dilution
(Invitrogen, Life technologies, USA) was given to the cells after
washing with BSA/PBS solution and further incubated (30 min). After
the incubation, the cells were again washed with BSA/PBS and then
resuspended in PBS (400 μL) and were analyzed by flow cytometry
(BD FACS Aria III, BD Biosciences, USA). The COX-2 expression in the
treated cells in comparison with control cells was also analyzed using
FlowJo software and expressed as percentage.

4.6 Synthesis of N-GQDs
The preparation
of N-GQDs is as follows. Citric acid (0.75 g) and 0.25 g of l-asparagine were mixed and ground well using a mortar. The reaction
mixture was taken in a 100 mL beaker and pyrolyzed on a heating mantle.
Initially, the colorless solid melts to a pale yellow liquid. After
10 min, a dark yellow residue was formed, which suggests the formation
of N-GQDs. The obtained product was then cooled to room temperature,
and it was dissolved in 50 mL of NaOH solution (10 mg/mL) and stored
in a standard measuring flask.

4.7 Procedure
for Spectral and TEM Analysis
In a 170 mL flask, known amounts
of N-GQDs and SAM were added. Each solution (2.5 mL)
was transferred to the quartz
cell and the absorbance was measured, and the same procedure was used
for emission measurements. High-resolution (HR-TEM images of GQDs
were obtained from a JEOL JEM 2100 Advanced Analytical HR-TEM instrument,
operating at 200 kV. For the TEM measurement, the sample was prepared
by dropping 2 μL of N-GQDs on the carbon-coated copper grid.

4.8 Anti-Inflammatory Study of SAM Combined
with N-GQDs in Macrophage 264.7 Cell Lines
4.8.1 Live
Cell Imaging of RAW 264.7 Cell Lines
Treated with SAM and N-GQDs by HCS Analysis
RAW 264.7 cell lines (5 × 103) were seeded into 96-cell
carrier plates (PerkinElmer) with DMEM medium. The cells were induced
with LPS and incubated for 2 h. Then, the cells were treated with SAM alone and SAM + N-GQDs compound and incubated
for 12 h. The cells were washed with PBS twice and analyzed by HCS
analysis. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs was specific to the
emission range (270–700 nm).

4.8.2 Quantification
of the Intracellular ROS
Level
Intracellular reactive oxygen scavenging levels were
quantified by the DCF-DA assay.40 The RAW
264.7 cell lines were seeded into a 96-well plate at 1 × 104 cells/well. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were induced
with LPS (1 mg/mL) and kept for 1 h incubation; then, the cells were
treated with SAM and SAM + N-GQDs and kept
for 24 h incubation. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated
with DCF-DA (25 μM) for 45 min in an incubator. The cells were
washed with PBS once again and the fluorescence intensity was measured
at Ex/Em =
485/540 nm (Biotek, US).

4.8.3 NO Inhibition Assay
The NO scavenging
potential of RAW 264.7 cell lines was estimated by using Griess reagent38 (Sigma) that quantifies nitrite concentration
in the medium. The RAW 264.7 cell lines were seeded into a 96-well
plate and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Further, the cells were
induced with LPS (1 mg/mL) and incubated for 1 h; further, the cells
were treated with SAM and SAM + N-GQDs and
incubated for 24 h. After incubation, 100 μL of Griess reagent
(Sigma) was added into the wells and incubated for 10 min; and the
absorbance was measured at the wavelength of 540 nm and normalized
against DMEM culture medium used as blank (Biotek, US).

4.8.4 Semiquantitative PCR and RT-PCR Analysis
The expressions
of cytokines IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α,
and NF-κß genes (Table S2) were studied in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell lines which
were treated with SAM and N-GQDs. The RAW 264.7 cell
lines were seeded into six different groups: Control cells (untreated
and uninduced), LPS-induced cells, control cells provided with N-GQDs,
LPS-induced and N-GQDs, LPS-induced N-GQDs and SAM treated
cells, and LPS-induced SAM alone treated cells. The cells
were incubated for 12 h, and the total RNA was isolated from the cells
by TRIzol method according to the manufacture protocol. The extracted
RNA was DNase-treated and quantified by a biophotometer (Eppendorf,
Germany); RNA (3 μg) was used for cDNA synthesis using oligo
dT primers. The mRNA expressions of IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-4, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS, TNF-α, and NF-κß were measured using
semiquantitative PCR. The PCR reaction was carried out in a mastercycler
(Eppendrof, Germany) at the exponential phase of 32 PCR cycles at
95 °C for 30 s (denaturation), 55 °C for 30 s (annealing),
and 72 °C for 45 s (extension). The amplified products were electrophoresed
in 2% agarose gel by electrophoresis. Further, the expression levels
of band intensities of the genes were analyzed by the densitometry
software ImageJ. The mRNA expressions of the genes were measured using
RT-PCR also. The RT-PCR was carried out in a thermo cycler (ABI PRISM
7000 Sequence Detection System, Thermo Fiesher) at 50 °C for
2 min, 95 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1
min, and 60–95 °C for 20 min for 20 cycles. The data were
analyzed by using the following equation 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = (CT,target – CT,actin)time x – (CT,target – CT,actin)time 0.41
