The aim of this study
was to improve water resistance of camelina
protein (CP) for wood adhesives with depolymerized lignin. Kraft lignin
was depolymerized by H2O2-induced oxidation
in the presence of ultrasound (US) irradiation to reduce lignin’s
particle size and thermal stability and increase the hydroxyl group.
Coupling with depolymerized lignin camelina protein exhibited increased
hydrophobicity. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis revealed that the
oxidation treatment of lignin further stimulated the hydrophobization
effect of the protein–lignin copolymer due to the increased
reactivity of depolymerized lignin to camelina protein. Accordingly,
the water resistance of CP–lignin adhesives was significantly
improved. When copolymerized with US-induced oxidized lignin, the
camelina protein had increased wet shear adhesion strength from 0.28
to 1.43 MPa, with wood panels passing the three-cycle water-soaking
test. The CP resin, with depolymerized lignin as an economical, green,
and bio-based hydrophobic enhancer, provided an alternative to the
petroleum-based and other edible protein-based adhesives, such as
soy protein.

==== Body
Introduction
Plant proteins, such
as soybean protein, have been modified and
commercially available for bio-based adhesives and coatings. However,
soybean proteins are also important human diets worldwide; therefore,
the competition between food and nonfood uses of edible proteins urged
us to find alternative nonedible protein sources. Camelina is an easy-growing
oilseed crop on dry land; in the past few decades, it has drawn increasing
attention due to its abundance in polyunsaturated fatty acids, which
were known for aviation fuels and health benefits. Accordingly, the
ever-accumulating interest for camelina oil is generating increasing
desired amounts of camelina meal (CM) that contains 40% crude protein.
However, some potential antinutritional toxic compounds in camelina
restricted the food uses of the protein extracted from CM. Therefore,
camelina protein (CP) becomes a suitable nonedible protein source
for bio-based products, such as adhesives.

Plant proteins contain
similar amino acids in terms of content;
however, they have different amino acid sequences that make the proteins
different from each other. Therefore, the modification method good
for soybean protein is not necessarily suitable for camelina protein.
As a relatively new protein source, there are only limited studies
on the modification and application of CP. We previously elucidated
the unfolding behaviors of CP by disrupting hydrogen bond and disulfide
bonds.1 By utilizing the cysteine-induced
denaturation, Zhao et al.2 developed CP-based
film with improved physicochemical properties for cell culture. Reddy
et al.3 grafted camelina with vinyl monomers
to modify the thermoplastic properties. However, similar to other
plant protein polymers, there are two major concerns regarding CP’s
adhesive application: (1) low mechanical strength, which is due to
the weak protein–protein interaction and (2) poor water resistance
caused by protein’s hydrophilic nature. To resolve these problems,
scientists usually applied classic protein modification techniques,
such as unfolding, cross-linking, and side-group grafting, to increase
the protein’s hydrophobicity, cross-linking degree, and reactivity.4 Regarding plant protein-based wood adhesives,
such as soy, adding proper hydrophobic additives seems to be most
effective and convenient to increase the adhesion properties of the
cured protein resins, especially under aqueous conditions.5,6 Those hydrophobic materials, such as polyvinyl acetate,7 polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin,8 and polyurethane,9,10 would stabilize the
protein structure during the curing progress and contribute to the
water resistance of adhesives. Unfortunately, high proportions of
toxic additives in the protein-based adhesives significantly destroyed
the biodegradability and environment-friendly features of biopolymers.
Besides the previously mentioned chemicals, to date, there are growing
interests in developing bio-based hydrophobic enhancers for polymer
fabrication. Lignin, the most abundant and underutilized biopolymer,
exhibited its potential in improving the mechanical, thermal, and
hydrophobic properties. From the chemists’ point of view, lignin’s
abundant aromatic structures, phenolic hydroxyls, and tough structures
should be appropriate to act as copolymers to modify protein’s
hydrophobicity, reactivity, and mechanical properties. Thus, the development
of lignin-reinforced protein adhesive could meet the expectation for
both environment friendliness and water resistance.

In spite
of the appealing performance, lignin’s inert nature
limits its reactivity and solubility and hinders its further applications;
thus, functionalization treatment is necessary. Depolymerization techniques,
including pyrolysis, oxidation, enzymatic and ionic liquids treatment,
are effective to break down lignin’s heterogeneous structures,
release functional groups, and increase reactivity.11−13 Compared to
other lignin depolymerization techniques that require harsh temperature
condition or complicated ionic solvents, oxidative depolymerization
of lignin under mild and solvent-free reaction conditions should be
considered because of its eco-friendly nature and practicality. Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) was widely used to induce such
depolymerization. Tortora et al. utilized H2O2 oxidation to prepare lignin-based microcapsules for drug delivery,14 whereas many others used this approach to prepare
soluble lignin fragments with reactive moiety.11,15,16 For a higher oxidation efficiency of H2O2, ultrasound (US) technique, a green and efficient
means, was utilized to increase free radicals that accelerated the
oxidation.17 In addition, the cavitation
force generated by US could also fragment lignin substrates into nanoparticles.18

In recent years, development of lignin-based
biopolymers has become
attractive. However, to the best of our knowledge, little is known
about the interaction between plant proteins and depolymerized lignin.
Although lignin has been widely used as a hydrophobic enhancer to
improve water resistance of protein polymers, the partially depolymerized
lignin in this research had further benefits when it was applied in
protein-based wood adhesives. At high pH (strong base condition),
lignin was dissolved and protonated with increased reactivity; however,
in our previous research, we found that soy protein under the base
condition exhibited significantly reduced adhesion. However, under
neutral and acidic conditions, soy protein had strong adhesion but
lignin was insoluble and thus the interaction between soy protein
and lignin was limited.19,20 We observed similar
phenomena between camelina protein and lignin in our preliminary experiments.
The goal of this research was to improve the interaction of lignin
with camelina protiens (CP) by partially depolymerized lignin through
lignin oxidation. We believed that the depolymerized lignin would
increase its solubility in and miscibility with CP at neutral pH,
and consequently, the wet adhesion strength of CP–lignin adhesive
would improve.

Our aim was to develop an eco-friendly wood adhesive
from the low-value
nonedible camelina proteins and improve its water resistance by copolymerizing
it with functionalized lignin. Lignin was depolymerized by (ultrasound-assisted)
H2O2 oxidation. The modified lignin was analyzed
by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) to examine the depolymerization effect. After copolymerization,
the resultant adhesives were characterized for hydrophobicity, rheological
properties, and wood adhesion strength. Once optimized, this approach
provides a green and facile way to stimulate lignin and protein interaction
and adds marketable values to camelina meals and lignin.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Reaction Pathways
The proposed chemical reactions
of lignin and protein are presented in Schemes 1 and 2. In the presence of H2O2, the oxidation
reaction of kraft lignin would increase its surface area and −OH
groups and reduce the particle size. Scheme 1 describes reinforced intermolecular interaction
between camelina protein and depolymerized lignin. Initially, the
pristine lignin exhibited low reactivity and miscibility with camelina
protein due to its hydrophobic nature. It is hypothesized that after
the oxidation treatment the reduced particle size and increased functional
group of depolymerized lignin would stimulate its conjugation with
camelina protein in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl
ether (PEGDE); then, the stabilized copolymer would obtain increased
cohesion and hydrophobicity, which further enhances its adhesion strength,
especially under the wet condition. Scheme 2 presents the interaction between the wood
and copolymer adhesives. The newly appeared −OH groups at the
surface of oxidized lignin (OL) molecules would react with the functional
group (mostly −OH and −COOH) at wood surface, which
contributes to the interfacial adhesion strength between the wood
and adhesives. In brief, the camelina protein and oxidized lignin
copolymer are expected to increase hydrophobicity and enhance cohesion
and interfacial adhesion strength; consequently, the water resistance
of its adhesive would be improved.

Particle Size and Morphology
Particle size is an important
parameter to reveal the effect of depolymerization on lignin, which
further influences lignin’s reactivity and compatibility with
proteins. The effect of oxidation treatments on volume-mean diameter
(D43) of lignins and their distribution
profiles are shown in Figure 1a. The heat-induced oxidation reaction reduced the particle
size (D43) of lignin significantly from
26 to 3.90 μm and further to 2.59 μm with ultrasound treatment.
Three major possible reaction pathways (Figure S1)21−23 have been proposed about the fragmentation effect
on lignin structures by H2O2-induced oxidation.
By dealkylation, the C–C and C–O bonds of lignin were
first cleaved. Then, hydroxylation and oxidation reactions further
increased the amphipathic property of lignin by introducing hydroxyl
groups. As a consequence, the depolymerized lignin obtained reduced
particle size and thus increased reactivity. Ultrasound treatment
led to further particle fragmentation through a physical “cavitation”
phenomenon. Locally high pressure and temperature generated free radicals
with high energy in the solution and thus lignin decomposed. Napoly
et al. also reported and explained the cavitation mechanism of ultrasound-driven
particle size reduction of kraft lignin.17

lignin, oxidized lignin (OL), and ultrasound-induced oxidized lignin

(DTG) curves of lignin, oxidized lignin (OL), and ultrasound-induced
oxidized lignin (UL).

To obtain more morphological details of the depolymerized
lignin
particles, TEM was used to observe the microstructures of OL and UL
in comparison to the native lignin. In consensus with the particle
size distribution profiles, native lignin turned into the smaller-particle
OL and UL after oxidation reaction (Figure 1b). Native lignin was a big chunklike particle
with no porous or fibrous structure, which was due to lignin’s
highly cross-linked structure. Unlike the other biopolymers, such
as proteins or gums, whose structures are highly dependent on intermolecular
noncovalent bonds,4 lignin’s phenyl
rings are covalently bonded by C–C or C–O. Lignin’s
condensed structure results in limited surface area and chemically
inert nature. After oxidative depolymerization, the lignin particle
was fragmented into small pieces like a shattered rock. The average
dimension of the newly formed OL was about 2 μm, which was consistent
with DLS results. When applying ultrasound to induce the oxidation
reaction, in addition to the H2O2-induced dealkylation
effect, the cavitation force further reduced the particle size of
lignin by disrupting its intermolecular hydrogen bond and thus UL
exhibited more fragmented morphology than OL.

FTIR
FTIR analysis
was used to qualitatively examine
the changes in lignin’s functional groups. In Figure 1c, a broad peak was observed
ranging from 3050 to 3500 cm–1, which was assigned
to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group (both aromatic and
aliphatic hydroxyl groups) for both pristine and modified lignin,
and this peak for both OL and UL was stronger than that for the native
lignin. This was due to the increased hydroxyl groups generated by
dealkylation and hydroxylation. There are also two peaks at 2864 and
2937 cm–1, assigned to the methoxyl group linked
with C–H band. Thus, the band intensity slightly decreased
for OL and UL at 2864 cm–1, indicating the removal
of methoxyl groups from lignin’s aromatic ring. In addition,
the band around 1700 cm–1 was assigned to native
lignin’s C=O stretching of acetyl group; however, it
significantly reduced for both OL and UL. This C=O group consumption
may be due to the repolymerization effect of lignin fragments by H2O2-induced oxidation. Such phenomenon was also
reported by other studies on lignin’s oxidative depolymerization.18,24

More distinct difference in band shapes can be observed in
the fingerprint region (Figure S2). The
band intensities increased for OL and UL at 1590 and 1510 cm–1, respectively, which denoted the C=C stretching of the aromatic
ring. Bands at 1260 and 1330 cm–1 are attributed
to the C–O stretch in lignin for guaiacyl groups and syringyl
groups, respectively. For OL and UL, the band intensity at 1268 cm–1 decreased significantly, whereas they were relatively
stable at 1215 cm–1. This result indicates that
H2O2-induced oxidation had more obvious effects
on decomposing guiacyl structures than on syringyl moiety.17 Thus, by examining the IR spectra, we observed
lignin’s three oxidation pathways in the presence of H2O2: hydroxylation, dealkylation, and oxidative
coupling (Figure S1).

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
Derivative thermogravimetry
(DTG) curves of native lignin, OL, and UL are shown in Figure 1d. Native lignin exhibited
one big thermal derivate weight loss peak ranging from 250 to 500
°C, whose maximum degradation rate was at 385 °C. Interestingly,
after the oxidation and ultrasound treatment, besides the peak at
385 °C, there was a new peak for the DTG curves of OL and UL
at about 310 °C. These differences can be explained by the varied
stability of lignin chemical bonds. There are three major chemical
bonds for lignin’s complex structures: lateral chain, C–C
bonds, and aromatic rings. Due to their different chemical stabilities,
they exhibited different decomposition temperatures: the lateral chain
decomposed at around 245 °C, C–C bond decomposed at around
310 °C, and the aromatic ring with the highest stability decomposed
from 350 to 410 °C.25 Thus, the broad
peak of native lignin’s DTG curve was due to the decomposition
of these three bonds. For OL and UL, the newly appeared peak at 310
°C was assigned to the C–C bond degradation, and we can
still find the aromatic ring degradation peak at about 385 °C.
As the oxidation and ultrasound broke down and unfolded the rigid
structure of OL and UL, their C–C bond became more exposed
than the native lignin for heat decomposition.

Fluorescence
To
verify the conjugating effect of CP
on different lignins, the hydrophobicity of CP–lignin was evaluated
by detecting the 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) binding capacity.
Lignin, with a large amount of aromatic groups, contributed to CP’s
hydrophobicity, which can be determined by the fluorescence intensity
(FI) in the presence of ANS.1 Thus, increased
FI indicated enhanced protein–lignin interaction. As expected,
P–CP exhibited the lowest FI (Figure 2). In addition, the FI of depolymerized lignin-based
copolymers (P–CPOL, P–CPUL) was higher than that of
P–CPL, suggesting that the depolymerized lignin was more cross-linked
with CP than the native lignin. As previously discussed, lignin was
functionalized by the oxidation reaction with increased reactivity
and decreased particle size, which facilitated the protein–lignin
interaction. Compared to heat-induced oxidation, ultrasound treatment
stimulated the depolymerization effect by further reducing lignin’s
particle size to induce increased reactivity (Figure 1a,b). Accordingly, the highest FI was obtained
by P–CPUL, indicating the strongest CP–lignin interaction,
which further improved the water resistance of the resultant adhesive.

Rheological Properties
Figure 3 shows the
storage modulus (G′) of different CP–lignin
copolymers as a function
of frequency sweep. For all of the CP–lignin dispersions, G′ increased linearly at a frequency region ranging
from 0.1 to 3 PaS and after that G′ exhibited
a nonlinear sharp increase. This result was consistent with our previous
frequency sweep study of CP.1 As described
by Tunick, the frequency at the boundary point between the linear
and sharp-increase regions was defined as critical frequency (fc). After fc point,
the protein polymer structure was broken down and thus the sharply
increased G′ after fc was not used to evaluate the protein polymers’ intermolecular
interactions.26−28 Due to different degrees of protein–lignin
polymerization, their G′ exhibited different
frequency dependences and different fc values. Before fc point, protein polymers
with strong intermolecular interaction exhibited low frequency dependence
and high fc frequency, and accordingly,
high storage modulus was observed.27 To
better describe the protein polymer’s G′
variation, in Table 1, we recorded fc and the G′ modulus at fc (Mfc).

CP exhibited
the weakest protein interaction, whose structure was
broken at 1.00 PaS with the lowest G′ of 5.52
Pa. After the addition of PEGDE, the structure of CP was stabilized,
and the fc value of P–CP increased
to 2.03 PaS with increased Mfc at 10.1
Pa. However, the fc value of P–CPL
decreased to 1.19 PaS, indicating that the lignin incorporation destabilized
P–CP’s network. As a highly cross-linked macromolecule,
lignin’s small surface-to-volume ratio leads to its inert nature
and low reactivity with other biomacromolecules. Only a small amount
of lignin would be copolymerized with CP, and the unreacted lignin
particles would weaken the protein polymerization due to the steric
hindrance effect. After oxidation, the weakening effect of lignin
disappeared for P–CPOL and P–CPUL. The fc value and storage modulus of both P–CPOL and
P–CPUL increased significantly. The fc and Mfc of P–CPOL reached
2.42 PaS and 22.1 Pa, and those of P–CPUL reached 3.46 PaS
and 29.0 Pa, respectively. Thus, the increased functionality and surface-to-volume
ratio of depolymerized lignins (OL and UL) induced their stronger
interaction with camelina protein than the native lignin. This effect
also contributed to the adhesion properties of protein–lignin
dispersions.

Adhesion Properties of Camelina Protein
Similar to
other plant proteins, CP molecules were unfolded in the solution,
and their free side groups from the unfolded polypeptide, such as
amino groups, carboxyl groups, and hydroxyl groups, formed strong
chemical bond with the available hydroxyl groups on the wood surface
under hot press condition. This process generated interfacial adhesion
between the wood surface and protein adhesives; in addition, the protein
molecules were also cross-linked and entangled with each other, thus
providing cohesion strength to the adhesives.

Figure 4 shows the dry shear strength
and wet shear strength (refers to water resistance) of the CP-based
adhesives polymerized with different lignins. The dry shear strength
of the unmodified camelina protein was 1.68 Pa. In the presence of
PEGDE alone (P–CP), the adhesion strength increased to 2.13
MPa, followed by a small decrease to 1.87 MPa for P–CPL. This
is consistent with the results of frequency sweep that pointed the
weakening effect of pristine lignin particles to the CP molecular
interaction. When the lignin was depolymerized, the dry shear strength
of P–CPOL and P–CPUL increased to 2.28 and 2.35 MPa,
respectively.

Figure 4 Dry shear strength and wet shear strength of different
adhesive
samples.

Regarding the wet strength, similar
to soy protein, CP-based adhesives
are not water-resistant as their adhesion strength decreased drastically
after water soaking. The unmodified CP had the lowest wet adhesion
strength at 0.2 MPa. After the addition of PEGDE cross-linking agent,
camelina protein structure was cross-linked, and its wet shear strength
increased significantly to 0.84 MPa for P–CP. The addition
of lignin induced further increase in the water resistance of P–CPL
to 0.95. Although the unmodified lignin interfered with protein’s
cross-linking effect and reduced the dry shear strength of adhesives,
it increased the wet strength of CP adhesives as a hydrophobic enhancer.
This strengthening effect of native lignin was widely utilized to
improve the water resistance of hydrophilic biopolymers. Luo et al.29 developed a soy meal-based wood adhesive with
improved water resistance using kraft lignin. Huang et al. investigated
the effect of alkaline lignin and lignosulfonate on soy protein-based
composite for enhanced mechanical performance and aqueous absorption.
They found that, as a hydrophobic filler, the alkaline lignin increased
the tensile strength, thermal stability, and water resistance of soy
protein,30 whereas lignosulfonate contributed
to soy protein’s microphase separation and the formation of
cross-linked structures.31

Instead
of simply mixing the lignin and protein, functionalized
lignin further increased the protein’s water resistance. In
this research, the wet shear strength of P–CPOL and P–CPUL
reached 1.35 and 1.43 MPa, respectively. Consistent with the results
of wet strength, although a proportional CP, P–CP, and P–CPL
failed a three-cycle water-soaking test, all of the specimens of P–CPOL
and P–CPUL passed (Table 2). The pristine CP exhibited major slippage (3.8 in.).
After the copolymerization, the delamination degrees of P–CP
(1.72 in.), P–CPL (1.86 in.), and P–CPOL (0.78 in.)
decreased significantly. For P–CPUL, only minimal delamination
was observed (0.18 in.), indicating its strongest water resistance.
As we hypothesized in Schemes 1 and 2, compared
to native lignin, depolymerized lignins (PL and UL) contain newly
formed hydroxyl groups that were able to form stronger hydrogen bonds
and covalent bonds with the polar groups of camelina protein, which
increased the cohesion of the adhesives. In addition, these hydroxyl
groups increased the adhesion strength by stimulating the interfacial
bonding between the wood surface and protein adhesives32,33 (details in Schemes 1 and 2).

For comparison purposes, we duplicated the most commonly
used adhesives
in our lab, including polymeric amine epichlorohydrine (PAE)- or NaHSO3-modified soy protein-based adhesives and urea-formaldehyde
(UF)-based adhesives (Table 3). The wet strength of plywood bonded with the newly developed
CP–lignin adhesive was 3.8 times higher than that bonded with
commercial UF-based adhesives, 1.8 times higher than that bonded with
NaHSO3-modified soy protein isolate (SPI), and 13.6% higher
than that bonded with the polymeric amine epichlorohydrine (PAE)-modified
SPI adhesives. The comparison data indicated that the hydrophobic
chemical structures from lignin had high efficiency to improve the
water resistance of CP-based adhesives.

Conclusions
Camelina protein copolymerized with oxidized kraft lignin improved
water resistance of wood adhesives. To stimulate the protein–lignin
interaction, lignin was depolymerized by H2O2-induced oxidation under elevated temperature (50 °C) and ultrasound
irradiation separately. The modified lignin exhibited increased hydroxyl
groups and reduced particle size. The oxidation induced by ultrasound
irradiation treatment was more effective to induce the decomposition
of lignin structure and increase its reactivity. Accordingly, the
adhesive derived from camelina protein copolymerized with oxidized
kraft lignin induced by ultrasound irradiation (P–CPUL) had
the strongest intermolecular interaction and highest water resistance.
The nonedible camelina protein copolymerized with oxidized kraft lignin
has potential for industrial adhesive applications, which would benefit
camelina oil-based energy industry as well as paper industry.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Defatted camelina meal (DCM) with 32.4% crude
protein (db) and 11% moisture content (db) was provided by Field Brothers
Inc. (Pendroy, MT). Crude protein intake was separated from DCM using
the method described by Li et al., with some modifications.33 Lignin (alkali), poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl
ether (PEGDE; Mn 500), hydrochloric acid
(HCl), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and urea-formaldehyde were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Hydrogen peroxide and sodium bisulfite
were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). Polymeric amine
epichlorohydrine (PAE) was provided by Wuhu Hangchen Trading Co. Ltd
(Wuhu, China). PAE is in aqueous solution at 12.7% solid content and
pH 3.9. Soy protein was obtained using the method described by Liu
et al.6 SPI was precipitated at pH 4.5,
redissolved at pH 7.6, and then freeze-dried (freeze dryer Model 6211-0459;
The VirTis Company, Inc., Gardiner, NY). The dried SPI was milled
into powder, with 95% passed through U.S. #100 mesh. The freeze-dried
SPI powder sample had a protein content of 85.6% and a moisture content
of 8%. Yellow pine wood veneers with dimensions of 305.50 mm ×
305.50 mm × 3.26 mm (width × length × thickness) were
provided by Veneer One (Oceanside, NY).

Lignin Depolymerization
To prepare the oxidized lignin
(OL) solution, 2 g of lignin substrate was dispersed into 100 mL of
distilled water, with pH adjusted to 10.5 by adding NaOH solution
(3 M) and gently stirring for 30 min. Then, 1 mL of hydrogen peroxide
was added. After conditioning for 10 min, the solution was heated
at 50 °C for 16 h to induce the oxidation reaction. To prepare
the ultrasound-induced oxidized lignin (UL) solution, an ultrasound
processor model VCF 1500 (Sonics & Materials Inc., Newtown, CT)
was used to sonicate the lignin dispersion instead of heat treatment
to induce oxidation. Sample solutions were treated at 20 kHz and 480
W for 60 min (pulse duration of on-time 5 s and off-time 5 s). The
resultant OL solution and UL solution had a pH of 7.2, and they were
further used for the adhesive preparation and particle size characterization.
Their lyophilized samples were used for IR and TGA tests.

Characterization
of Depolymerized Lignin
Particle Size
The particle size
of lignin was characterized
by both dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Native lignin, OL, and UL solutions (2% w/v) were prepared
to measure their volume distribution and volume-mean diameters by
DLS (HORIBA Laser Scattering Particle Size Distribution Analyzer LA-910).
A Philips CM 100 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) transmission electron
microscope was used to study the microstructure of native lignin,
OL, and UL. All samples were diluted to 0.2% with deionized (DI) water
and absorbed onto Formvar/carbon-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). The morphological properties
of each sample were recorded with the transmission electron microscope
operating at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV.

FTIR and Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
FTIR spectra
of native lignin, OL, and UL samples were acquired with a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 400 FT-IR/FT-NIR Spectrometer (Waltham, MA) over the 4000–400
cm–1 region at 64 scan and a resolution of 4 cm–1. The TGA (PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT) was also carried
out in a nitrogen-rich environment, which provided an inert atmosphere
during pyrolysis. The samples were heated from 50 to 700 °C at
a heating rate of 20 °C /min.

Preparation of CP–Lignin-Based
Adhesives
CP
powder (1:10 w/v) was dissolved in DI water, lignin solution, OL solution,
and UL solution separately and gently stirred for 1 h at pH 7.2. In
our preliminary experiment, the content of lignin was fixed at 20%
to CP (dry base). Then, PEGDE was added at 2% concentration (v/v),
and the resultant dispersion was heated at 85 °C for 30 min to
stimulate the copolymerization. After cooling to room temperature,
the adhesive was used for wood test and also lyophilized for fluorescence
test. In summary, five different formulations for CP-based adhesives
are shown in Table 4 (percent lignin was based on the dry weight of CP).

Table 4 Different Formulations of CP–Lignin-Based
Adhesives
number	formulation	lignin content
(%)	notation	
1	CP	0	CP	
2	CP cross-linked by PEGDE	0	P–CP	
3	CP/native lignin cross-linked by PEGDE	20	P–CPL	
4	CP/OL cross-linked by PEGDE	20	P–CPOL	
5	CP/UL cross-linked by PEGDE	20	P–CPUL	
Surface Hydrophobicity
Surface hydrophobicity was measured
using 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) as the fluorescence probe
as previously reported with modification.1 P–CP, P–CPL, P–CPOL, and P–CPUL dispersions
(see Table 4 for sample
description) were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (0.2 M, pH
7.5) at 2 mg/mL. After centrifuging to remove any insoluble matter,
60 μL of ANS solution (8.0 mM in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH
7.4) was added to 3 mL of sample solution. Sample solutions were excited
at 365 nm, and the relative fluorescence intensity of emission spectra
was recorded from 400 to 600 nm using a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a slit width
of 10 nm.

Rheological Properties
A Bohlin C-VOR 150 rheometer
(Malvern Instruments, Southborough, MA) was used to characterize the
viscoelastic properties of adhesives. A parallel plate head was used
with a 20 mm plate diameter and a 500 μm gap. A thin layer of
silicon oil was spread over the circumference of the sample to prevent
sample dehydration during testing. All experiments were performed
in triplicate at 1% strain (within its linear viscoelastic region).
Frequency sweep analyses were performed for a frequency range of 0.1–100
rad/s. The testing temperature was 23 °C.

Preparation of Three-Layer
Wood
The 300 × 300
× 3.5 mm dimension yellow pine were preconditioned in a 27 °C,
30% relative humidity (RH) chamber at least 1 week before wood adhesion
test. The three veneers were layered up in a way that grain line of
the middle panels were perpendicular to the grain lines up in a way
that grain of the top and bottom panels. Around 20–22 g/ft2 (wet basis) adhesives were brushed on the two faces of the
middle veneer panel only. The assembled wood specimen was standing
for 15 min before hot press. The hot press conditions were 150 °C
and 10 min at 1.03 MPa. The bonded three-layer wood specimens were
conditioned in a chamber at 23 °C and 50% RH for 2 days. Then,
they were cut into 10 small pieces (82.6 × 25.6 mm2) and 4 large pieces with dimension of 50 × 127 mm2 for three-cycle water-soaking test.

Shear Strength Measurement
and Water Resistance
Five
small wood specimens were soaked in water for 24 h at 23 °C to
test the wet adhesion strength, whereas five specimens were used to
test the dry adhesion strength. Both dry strength and wet strength
were tested with an Instron Tester (Model 4465, Canton, MA) according
to ASTM Standard Method D906-9834 at a
crosshead speed of 1.6 mm/min. Adhesion strength was recorded as stress
at the maximum load. Four large wood panels were used for the three-cycle
water-soaking test in accordance with American National Standard for
Hardwood and Decorative Plywood (ANSI/HPVA HP-1-2004).35 In each cycle, the wood specimens were soaked
at 23 °C for 4 h and then dried at 50 °C with good air circulation
for 19 h. After drying, the wood pieces were evaluated for delamination,
and the delamination was recorded. Any wood piece with delamination
length value higher than 2 in. was considered as failed.
