Since
the discovery of graphene by sticking and peeling scotch
tape off graphite, it has also been prepared by other methods, such
as thermal decomposition of SiC and chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
with catalytic layer. Both the exfoliation and CVD methods impose
to transfer the graphene layers on other insulating substrates for
device applications. We reported that diamond grows in oxygen atmosphere
(Yoshimoto M.  ; Nature 1999 , 399 , 340 −342 ) in which oxidative etching and depositing
carbon compete under equivalent conditions. However, oxygen atmosphere
is too intense for graphite growth. Although carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced after hydrocarbon combustion, it can be a gentle and tender oxidant in certain situations. Here, we
show the direct growth of graphene on insulating substrates in 100%
CO2 environment and observe its layer-by-layer growth on
the stepped edge of an insulating substrate. The direct growth can
have a significant advantage of excluding the necessary process of
transferring the graphene on the insulating substrate over other common
methods.

Introduction
By the scotch tape
method, graphite repeatedly stuck and peeled
off (in a painful way with poor yield) turned into graphene flakes
with typical size of 10 μm.1 Graphene,
a two-dimensional (2D) structure of graphite, has become a new attractive
material because of its unique physical properties.2 Graphene is not only the thinnest and strongest material
in all of the resources, but it also shows excellent electrical,3 thermal, mechanical,4 and optical properties.5,6 These properties of
graphene can be of importance in many novel applications, such as
field-effect transistors and photodetectors.7,8

For large-scale production of graphene, enormous efforts have been
devoted to develop alternative methods besides the primitive technique
using scotch tape. The thermal decomposition of SiC9,10 requires
literally high temperature to sublimate Si atoms to form carbon sheet;
furthermore, it is expensive and forms nonuniform structures on the
film surface. By chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a well-established
method, graphene uniformly grows on large areas covered with catalytic
layers, such as Ni, Pt, Ru, Ir, Cu, and Co, at high temperatures.11−13 Although graphene layers epitaxially grow by the CVD method, both
CVD and exfoliation methods require transferring the graphene layers
onto another insulating substrate for electronic measurements or device
applications. Other methods, such as nanodiamond conversion14,15 and electrochemical deposition, are also used to prepare graphene
films.4 Recently, we have reported a novel
but simple and primitive method using a lead pencil and a piece of
paper.16

Pulsed laser deposition
(PLD) is one of the versatile methods for
growing thin films of insulators, semiconductors, and metals17−19 and even for producing nanoparticles.20 In contrast to the complex and expensive molecular beam epitaxy
(MBE) method,21 the PLD method is very
simple and flexible for the layer-by-layer deposition. The PLD method
is also employed to prepare various carbon materials, such as amorphous
carbon and diamondlike carbon (DLC), and even diamond grows in either
hydrogen or oxygen atmosphere by the PLD method.22,23 Carbon film prepared by the PLD method turns into diamond in a relatively
high oxygen pressure.23 The oxidizing atmosphere
consumes extra carbon atoms, such as amorphous carbon, and only diamond
remains in the oxygen atmosphere. With the increase of oxygen pressure
and substrate temperature, the oxidative etching becomes predominant
over depositing carbon on substrates. Even diamond cannot remain in
an inhospitable environment provided by oxygen atmosphere, and it
becomes carbon dioxide on reaction with oxygen atoms.

Interestingly,
stable and chemically nonreactive carbon dioxide
has been known to provide oxidizing atmosphere since the mid-19th
century,24,25 and carbon dioxide oxidizes metals26 such as magnesium, aluminum, silicon, calcium,
and iron by turning itself into carbon or carbon monoxide. As graphene
is made of only one layer of graphite sheet, oxidizing atmosphere
provided by oxygen gas is excessive for its growth. To present a more gentle and tender oxidizing atmosphere, we proposed carbon
dioxide instead of oxygen to obtain a fine adjustment of the oxidizing
atmosphere for graphene growth. By the PLD method together with CO2-oxidizing environment, layer-by-layer growth can be verified
on stepped insulating substrates, and layered graphene can be deposited
quite rapidly (∼1 min) compared with the CVD method, which
usually requires a relatively prolonged period for graphene deposition.27

Experimental Section
Carbon target
was irradiated in nitrogen atmosphere, and oxygen
and carbon dioxide at substrate temperature, from room temperature
to 800° C, at a wavelength of 532 nm, generated by a slow Q-switched
YAG laser.21 The carbon target was a highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the substrates were c-plane sapphire and SrTiO3(001) substrates. The distance
between the target and the substrate was varied from 20 to 60 mm,
and the types of gas atmosphere during depositions were nitrogen,
oxygen, and carbon dioxide with pressures between 1 and 43 Pa.

Carbon films were examined by Raman spectroscopy at a wavelength
of 785 nm, and the surface morphology was observed by atomic force
microscopy (AFM). Stepped SrTiO3(001) was used as a substrate
to investigate the initial growth of graphene films. AFM was again
employed to investigate the top surface of monographene, and 2D Fourier
transform was used to observe the six-membered carbon ring on the
stepped insulating substrates.

Raman spectroscopy obtained at
the wavelength of 785 nm was corrected
using Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2241 provided by the National
Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).28 SRM 2241 is a certified spectroscopic standard (optical glass) intended
for correction of the relative intensity of Raman spectra observed
at the wavelength of 785 nm. Together with SRM 2242 and 2243, Raman
spectra obtained at wavelengths of 785, 532, or 488/514.5 nm can be
corrected by coefficients of the certified polynomial and of the confidence
curves describing the luminescence spectrum of SRM 2241.

Results and Discussions
In nitrogen atmosphere, graphene growth was reported by the PLD
method;29 however, the grown film resembled
graphite rather than graphene or multigraphene. The ratio of Raman
intensities of 2D to G peaks, I2D/IG, is often employed to estimate the number
of graphene layers.30−32 G and D peaks together with 2D peaks are observed
on carbon films prepared in nitrogen atmosphere with a high fluence
of 6 J/cm2. The 2D peak is quite weak, and the intensity
ratio (I2D/IG) remains less than 0.5.29 Carbon films
prepared in nitrogen atmosphere by the PLD method show a broad peak
around the G and D bands of graphite, indicating the growth of diamondlike
carbon.

In this study, diamondlike carbon also grew in nitrogen
atmosphere,
whereas both G and D peaks were clearly observed on samples prepared
in oxygen atmosphere, as shown in Figure 1a. In oxygen atmosphere, defective carbon
cluster, such as amorphous carbon, must be consumed before reaching
the substrate during deposition. The strong oxidizability in oxygen
atmosphere did not allow the film growth at high substrate temperature
and long distance between the substrate and the target (target distance),
that is, more than 40 mm.

Figure 1 Raman spectra of carbon films. The samples were
prepared in (a)
nitrogen and oxygen atmosphere at 9 Pa, (b) oxygen atmosphere, and
(c) carbon dioxide atmosphere. (d) Raman peak standardized by relative
intensity correction using Standard Reference Materials. Both G and
D peaks were clearly observed on samples prepared in oxidizing environment,
and the 2D peak corresponding to the graphene structure was observed
on samples prepared in carbon dioxide.

As shown in Figure 1b, in both G and D peaks clearly observed on samples prepared
in
oxygen atmosphere, oxygen pressure more than 20 Pa resulted in less
intense Raman peaks. In the figure, the solid gray line is the spectra
of high oxygen pressure of 20 Pa showing a small peak around 1330
cm–1, which is often observed by nanodiamond crystal.
No film grew under the condition of oxygen pressure more than 20 Pa.
There were no remarkable 2D peaks on all of the samples prepared in
oxygen atmosphere.

In oxygen atmosphere, at high temperature
of substrate, oxidative
etching must be dominant and result in severe oxidization. The carbon
cluster supplied by the PLD intensely reacts with the oxygen atoms
reaching the substrate in the deposition chamber. A more gentle and
tender oxidizing atmosphere is required for graphite growth. Interestingly,
chemically unreactive carbon dioxide provides oxidizing atmosphere
in vacuum environment and even in atmospheric pressure at high temperature.

In addition to oxygen, in this study, carbon dioxide was used as
oxidative gas for graphite deposition by the PLD method, as shown
in Figure 2a; the growth
of multigraphene was verified by Raman spectroscopy, and the surface
morphology was observed by AFM. Figure 1c shows Raman spectra of carbon films prepared in a
CO2 pressure range of 9–43 Pa. Although the plume
in oxygen atmosphere was relatively small and did not reach the substrate
with the target distance more than 30 mm, the plume in carbon dioxide
fully involved the substrate placed at the target distance of 40 mm.
The intensity of G and 2D peaks increased under optimal conditions
at a CO2 pressure of 25 Pa, substrate temperature of 800
°C, and the target distance of 40 mm.

Raman spectra excited at the wavelength
of 785 nm were different
from the ordinal spectra obtained at 532 nm, especially at high wavelengths
required for such 2D band of graphene, as the sensitivity of silicon
detector exponentially decreased at the region of high wavelength.
Applying the Standard Reference Material 2241 (SRM 2241) correction
into the Raman spectra observed at 795 nm, intensity-corrected Raman
spectra were obtained, as shown in Figure 1d. With SRM 2241 correction, the ratio of
Raman intensities (I2D/IG) was increased to be ∼2, indicating the direct
growth of multigraphene on the insulating substrate without any catalyst.
With the MBE method, graphitic film prepared on SrTiO3 substrate
in nitrogen atmosphere shows no 2D peak in a previous report.33 The details about the SRM correction can be
found in the Supporting Information.

What makes a gentle and tender oxidizing environment? Carbon dioxide
is extremely stable in the environment. Surprisingly, carbon monoxide
becomes much more stable than carbon dioxide at high temperature,
such as 900 °C, even in atmospheric environment. In the high-vacuum
environment, carbon monoxide is stable in the following equilibrium
state 1  as shown in Figure 2b. The above reaction
was first studied by
Deville in 1864,24 and the effect of temperature
on the equilibrium was investigated by Boundouard.25 In 1910, quantitative investigation by Rhead et al. showed
that 2  proceeded at
a speed of 166 times higher that
of the reverse reaction.34,35 They also investigated
the effect of temperature together with gas pressure on the equilibrium
state and showed that the formation of carbon monoxide from carbon
dioxide was favored even at 500 °C in vacuum atmosphere (0.001
atm).

To investigate the initial growth of graphene, the graphene
films
were prepared on stepped annealed SrTiO3 substrates with
deposition time from 10 to 120 s. As shown in Figure 3a, a stepped surface consists of terrace
and ledge. The initial growth possibly starts (1) by sticking carbon
to the ledge of step (ledge growth) or (2) from the terrace edge (terrace-edge
growth). AFM was again employed to investigate the top surface by
using 2D Fourier transform. An annealed SrTiO3 substrate
showed an atomically flat stepped surface, as shown in Figure 3b,c. Small grains grew on the
flat terrace of stepped substrate with height between 0.2 and 0.35
nm (Figure 3d).

Figure 3 Surface morphology
of stepped substrate. (a) Schematic of two types
of initial growth on the stepped substrate. AFM images of (b) annealed
stepped SrTiO3 substrate in 2D view, (c) annealed stepped
SrTiO3 in 3D view, and graphene films with deposition times
of (d) 30 s and (e) 60 s. The inset in (f) shows six-membered carbon
rings observed on the sample deposited for 60 s.

In general, a thin film often starts to grow from kink or
ledge
of substrate. However, the grains grew at the terrace edge of the
stepped substrate instead of growing from ledge of terrace. Graphene
grew on the terrace edge in the initial stage, and the terrace showed
an atomically flat surface (Ra ∼ 0.02 nm) again after 60 s
deposition, as shown in Figure 3e. As shown in Figure 3d, nanoparticle grew at the initial stage of graphene deposition
on SrTiO3 substrate. The direct growth of graphene on germanium
(Ge) substrate, for instance, is self-limiting, such as the one deposited
on copper catalyst via a surface-mediated process rather than a precipitation
process.27 The growth of CVD graphene on
Ge does not involve C precipitation but is rather attributed to surface
adsorption. According to the equilibrium phase diagram of the Ge—C
system, the constituents in the Ge—C alloy are immiscible under
equilibrium in the bulk. Interestingly, graphene on mica shows ultraflat
surface36 instead of intrinsic rippling
with ∼1 nm high corrugations usually found on both freestanding
graphene and graphene film deposited on the substrate. The direct
growth of graphene on mica is accomplished by MBE.37 Mica with no extra dangling bonds on the surface is the
preferred substrate for van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy, which successfully
grows into a high-quality film with 2D layered materials, such as
MoS2238 and α-alumina.39 However, graphene does not cover all of the
mica surface and tends to agglomerate around the growth centers.37

Few-layered graphenes are synthesized
by the conversion of graphite
particle or nanodiamond in an inert or reducing atmosphere at high
temperature.15,40 Nanodiamond powder yields a few-layered
graphene after annealing for 1 h in helium atmosphere at about 2000
°C. During the direct growth of graphene in CO2-oxidizing
environment, in this study, the nanoparticle grew in the initial stage
of graphene deposition, as shown in AFM images (Figure 3d). Such a nanoparticle can lead to layered
graphene during PLD at a substrate temperature of 800 °C, which
is relatively lower than 2000 °C for the transformation of nanodiamond
to layered graphene. It is reasonable that a lower temperature was
required to form layered graphene during the deposition process compared
to that of the solid solution process, and the graphene converted
from nanodiamond shows only a weak 2D peak on Raman spectra. The formation
of crystal surface is often described by the terrace ledge kink model.41 The deposited atoms adsorb onto a substrate
and diffuse along the substrate surface; they are captured by kinks
of the terrace ledge to form crystal structure. However, graphene
has a 2D structure with strong covalent bonds and relatively weak
vdW-like forces, which are sufficient to keep the stack together.42 Such a vdW heterostructure might grow differently
from the terrace ledge kink model, in which the ordinal crystal structure
forms a thin film. As shown in Figure 3, the initial growth of graphene, in this study, did
not result from the terrace ledge but from the terrace edge and grew
by a layer-by-layer process.

Six-membered carbon rings were
observed on the sample with deposition
time more than 60 s, as shown in Figure 3f, indicating (1) the start of the layer-by-layer
growth of graphene from terrace edge on stepped substrates and (2)
the possibility of self-organization of wire graphene on insulating
substrates.

Summary
Diamond, one of the members of the carbon family,
grows in oxidizing
atmosphere in the presence of oxygen. Because the chemical processes
taking place in the oxygen atmosphere are relentless, especially at
high temperature, several carbon clusters will be consumed by oxygen
atoms during deposition, and only diamond might remain after deposition.
To provide a modest oxidizing environment, carbon target was irradiated
in carbon dioxide at a relatively low substrate temperature. Raman
spectroscopy verified the direct growth of multigraphene on SrTiO3 substrates without any catalyst layer. Graphene growing from
the terrace edge covered a partial area on stepped substrate, and
the film growth extended to all over the terrace after 60 s deposition,
resulting in the recovery of the flat surface; graphene showed “layer-by-layer”
growth on stepped structure. The growth of wire graphene can be expected
on the stepped structure by deposition in gentle and tender oxidizing
environment produced from carbon dioxide atmosphere.
