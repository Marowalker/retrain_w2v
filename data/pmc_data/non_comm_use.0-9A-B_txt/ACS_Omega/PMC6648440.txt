In
this paper, we report a simple, novel, and highly selective
plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs)-based colorimetric nanoprobe for the
detection of Al(III) ions in aqueous solution. 5-Hydroxy indole-2-carboxylic
acid (5H-I2CA) was utilized as a reducing as well as capping agent
for the preparation of silver nanoparticles (5H-I2CA@AgNPs). The interaction
between Al(III) and AgNPs was determined by UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier
transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and dynamic
light scattering techniques. The absorption values (A452–410) of the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs solution exhibited
a linear correlation with Al(III) ion concentrations within the linear
range of 0.1–50 nM. An outstanding selectivity toward Al(III)
was demonstrated by the proposed nanoprobe in the presence of interfering
cations. Kinetics was used to study the selectivity of nanoprobe,
which indicated second-order kinetics, and the rate constant was very
high. The activation energies of Al(III) were found to be the lowest
compared to those of other interfering ions. The results of kinetics
and thermodynamic study of Al(III) were compared to those of four
other competing ions. The thermodynamic data reveal that the interaction
best suited for Al(III) ion compared to other metal ions (Al(III)
> Co(II) > Hg(II) > Cr(III) ≅ Cr(VI)). The lower detection
limit of the proposed nanoprobe for Al(III) is 1 nM. The present method
also holds practical applicability for real water samples.

Introduction
Research on analytical
methods for trace-level detection of aluminum
ions is gaining interest nowadays owing to the toxic nature and impact
of aluminum on human health and environment.1−3 Aluminum has
a wide range of applications,4 and some
of its compounds are utilized in our day-to-day life, for instance,
in aluminum foils, vessels, food additives, pharmaceutical products,
etc.,5,6 thereby leading to the contamination of
food and water. Numerous epidemiologic studies suggested that even
a low-dose exposure of Al(III) can result in many health complications.
It is responsible for various disorders such as Alzheimer’s
disease,7,8 Parkinson’s disease,9,10 and dialysis encephalopathy.11,12 Thus, to circumvent
these difficulties, WHO has set the permissible limit of Al(III) in
drinking water as 7.4 μM.13 Therefore,
it is essential to develop new methods that can be efficiently utilized
for Al(III) detection, specifically in the underdeveloped areas.14

The routine methods that have been utilized
for Al(III) detection
involve atomic absorption spectrometry,15 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy,16 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry,17 electrochemical methods,18 etc. These methods require complex sample preparation and
expensive instrumentation and are also time-consuming. Hence, these
techniques are not viable for use in areas with limited resources,
making the detection of metal ions using colorimetric sensing materials
of significant interest.19,20 Among the colorimetric
sensing materials, silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs)-based colorimetric
detection methods have emerged as an efficient cost-effective alternative
to the above-mentioned analytical methods.21−26 These methods are based on the controlled aggregation of the surface-modified
AgNPs or AuNPs in the presence of target analytes. Owing to their
unique physicochemical properties and surface plasmon resonance (SPR),
they have been extensively utilized for trace-level detection of target
analytes.27−30 The target analyte-induced aggregation of NP causes a color change
of the solution as well as modification in their related absorption
spectra.31−34 This facilitates the detection of analyte ions by the naked eye
or using a simple UV–vis spectrophotometer technique.

To date, several AgNP or AuNP colorimetric methods have been developed
for the detection of Al(III) in aqueous system AuNPs. For example,
Xue and co-workers utilized 5-mercapto methyl tetrazole-capped AuNPs
(MMT-AuNPs) for the selective detection of Al(III).35 Chen and group demonstrated the use of triazole ether-functionalized
AuNPs for the detection of Al(III)ions in aqueous solution.36 The disadvantage of both the above methods is
the lengthy sample preparation process. Chen et al. prepared ionic
coated gold nanoparticles for the determination of Al(III) in vermicelli
samples.37 Our research group has also
reported a sensitive and selective method for the on-site detection
of Al(III) ions in aqueous solution by using indole-2-carboxylic acid
as a reducing as well as stabilizing agent.38 Although we obtained satisfactory results from our previous study,
the exact mechanism and excellent selectivity of Al(III) ion were
still unknown. Therefore, we have used a reducing and stabilizing
agent, i.e., 5-hydroxy indole-2-carboxylic acid (5H-I2CA), for the
synthesis of AgNPs as well as for the detection of Al(III) ions in
aqueous systems. This molecule has the advantage of the extra hydroxy
group, which is present at the fifth position and plays an important
role in sensing of aluminum. Being a Lewis acid, aluminum strongly
interacts with a hydroxyl group and gets adsorbed on the surface of
NPs. The presence of extra binding site (−OH group) makes it
a better molecule for Al(III) sensing in comparison to indole, 2-carboxylic
acid. The N- and O-containing ligands in 5H-I2CA are extremely prone
to get coordinated with the Al(III) ions.38 Thus, the detection limit observed for the present method was 1
nM, which is far better than the limit observed by our previously
reported method. The rationale design for this new nanoprobe for Al(III)
detection is illustrated in Schemes 1 and 2. To evaluate the selective interaction of the Al(III) ions with
the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs, thermodynamic and kinetics parameters were also
utilized. We have also characterized our probe before and after with
a number of techniques, especially X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), which governs the Al(III) sensing. The prepared NPs also displayed
excellent selectivity compared to other competing metal ions.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Stability of AgNPs
5-Hydroxy indole-2-carboxylic
acid (5H-I2CA) was utilized as both a reducing and capping agent in
the preparation of AgNPs. AgNPs were prepared at different pH values
ranging from 6 to 12. The UV–vis spectra were recorded after
10 min of the preparation of AgNPs at different pH values. The SPR
peak at pH 8 was the narrowest, having a well-defined peak at 410
nm (Figure S1a). Furthermore, with an increase
in pH, the peak intensity decreases with red shifting because of the
NPs destabilization. At low pH, a broad and low-intensity peak was
observed, indicating that the acidic medium did not support the NPs
preparation. At acidic pH, the reducing capacity of functional groups
present in 5H-I2CA@AgNPs decreases.39 In
the alkaline medium, the reducing capability increases as the dissociation
constant of the functional groups lies in the pH range 8–11.40 The inset of Figure S1a shows color change with respect to pH.

Stability of a nanoprobe
is an imperative feature in the NPs-based sensing applications. Therefore,
we analyzed the stability of the NPs at a pH range of 6–12.
A board peak was observed at pH 6, although the intensity of the peak
increases with pH and shows maximum value with a characteristic peak
at pH 9. Near physiological pH, the C=O group undertakes resonance,41 providing partial negativity to it, which in
turn ensures the electrostatic stability of the prepared AgNPs. A
decrease in the SPR peak intensity was observed with the increase
in pH because of the NPs destabilization (Figure S1b). The inset of Figure S1b shows
visual color at different pH values.

Effect of Temperature
The effect of increasing temperature
from 50 to 100 °C was determined on the preparation of AgNPs.
UV–vis spectral studies reveal that at 50 °C, a broad
peak was observed. However, the peak intensity increases along with
the blue shift with an increase in temperature up to 80 °C (Figure S2a), which indicates the preparation
of AgNPs. On further increasing the temperature, the peak intensity
decreases with the red shift from 410 to 423 nm. The corresponding
color change in the AgNP solutions is shown in the inset of Figure S2a. Thus, 80 °C was set as an optimal
temperature for the preparation of AgNPs.

Effect of Concentration
of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
The preparation
of the NPs was determined by observing the changes in the SPR bands
at each concentration. The reaction kinetics was determined by adding
50 mL of 1 × 10–3 M AgNO3 to various
concentrations of 5H-I2CA ranging from 1 × 10–5 to 1 × 10–1 M (Figure S2b). At initial concentration, a low-intensity broad band
was observed. However, with further increase in concentration, the
intensity of the SPR band increases up to 1 × 10–2 M. After that, a less intense red-shifted SPR peak was noted, thus
indicating 1 × 10–2 M of 5H-I2CA as an optimal
concentration for the preparation of AgNPs. It is expected that at
higher concentrations, the preparation of the secondary layer reduces
the density of electrons at the NPs’ surface, which results
in peak shift as well as a decrease in SPR intensity. Thus, the obvious
color change and red shifting in the absorption spectra of NPs are
the criteria for their increased size.42,43 The full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) was also demonstrated for determining the dispersity
of NPs.44 An increase in the FWHM values
was observed, which might be due to an increase in the NPs size (Figure S3(a,b) and Table 1).

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA analysis was done
to investigate the thermal stability of 5H-I2CA and 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
(Figure 1). For 5H-I2CA,
the sample started to degrade at around 150–270 °C. This
may be due to the decomposition of the carboxylate and amino functional
groups.40,45 Decomposition was found to occur at 335–360
°C due to the degradation of the 5H-I2CA backbone. In the case
of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs, the degradation occurred in three main steps. In
the first step, there was a weight loss at around 150–58 °C,
which was attributed to the physically adsorbed water molecules. Further
weight loss in the range of 300–360 °C may be attributed
to the pyrolysis of oxygen-containing groups. After the third stage,
the total weight loss for the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs was estimated at around
50%. Further weight loss is ascribed to the degradation of the stabilizing
materials over the NPs’ surface.46 The improved thermal stability of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs might be because
of the strong binding of the capping agent over the NPs’ surface.

of pure 5H-I2CA and 5H-I2CA@AgNPs.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Analysis
Figure S4a shows the FTIR spectrum of the 5H-I2CA
molecule. A strong band at 3341 cm–1 is allotted
to the N–H stretching vibration involved in the intermolecular
N–H···O hydrogen bonding. The peak at 3128 cm–1 arises due to the stretching vibration of OH group
involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The peaks at 1693 and
1190 cm–1 are due to the C=O and C–O
stretching vibrations in the carboxylic group, respectively,47 whereas in the FTIR spectrum of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs,
a peak shift from 1693 to 1600 cm–1 and the disappearance
of a peak at 1190 cm–1 indicate the involvement
of carboxylic group in the NPs preparation (Figure S4b). In alkaline medium, AgNO3 acted as an oxidizing
agent, which showed oxidative decarboxylation of 5H-I2CA forming an
indole cation. The formed intermediate species, which exists in its
tautomeric form, was highly unstable. In alkaline medium, Ag further
extracts two electrons from the hydroxyl group present at the second
position of indole ring and forms cation at its oxygen group. This
results in the preparation of the unstable intermediate and it then
tautomerizes into its stable intermediate. Further, the radical cation
formed at the third position of indole ring was attacked by the hydroxyl
anion, which oxidized into 2,3-dihydroxy indole. The release of electrons
during these processes was responsible for the preparation of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs,
and the negative charge on the surface of dihydroxy indole enhances
their stability (Scheme 1).

After interaction with Al(III), the characteristic peak
at 3100 cm–1 also disappears, indicating the interaction
of the Al(III) with the OH group of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs (Figure S4c). The interaction of Al(III) with 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
can be attributed to the presence of many electronegative N and O
elements in the molecule.48,38

Kinetics of Reactive Interaction
between Detection Nanoprobe
and Al(III)
The study of kinetics of reactive interaction
was carried out to determine the rate of interaction and also the
rate-determining kinetics. In this study, various kinetic models,
viz., zero-, first-, and second-order (Figure 2), were evaluated for Al(III), Co(II), Hg(II),
Cr(III), and Cr(VI) at three different temperatures. The linear forms
of zero-order (Figure 2a), first-order (Figure 2b), and second-order (Figure 2c) kinetic models are as follows (eqs 1–3) 1   2   3  where [At], [Ao], ko, and t are the absorbance at time t, absorbance
at time (t = 0), zero-order rate constant, and time,
respectively. The curves for zero-, first-, and second-order models
are plotted as [At] vs T, ln([At]/[Ao]) vs T, and 1/[At]
vs T, respectively, for Al(III), Co(II), Hg(II),
Cr(III), and Cr(VI). Figure 2a–c shows zero-, first-, and second-order kinetic plots
for all ions. R2-values for all ions fitted
in the second-order model of kinetics (Table 2).

models for Al(III),
Co(II), Hg(II), Cr(III), and Cr(VI).

The rate constant value for Al(III) is the highest
among five metal
ions, i.e., the prepared nanoprobe is highly selective toward Al(III).
The second-order rate constants for all metal ions are in the sequence
of Al(III) (Figure 3a) > Co(II) (Figure 3b) > Hg(II) (Figure 3c) > Cr(III) (Figure 3d) ≅ Cr(VI), which is shown in Tables 2 and 3 for three temperatures,
i.e., 298, 303, and 308 K. The rate constant of the second-order reaction
is 0.81 au–1 min–1 for Al(III),
which is much higher than other metal ions’ rate constants
as well as other kinetic constants (Figure 3).

The order of the kinetic model to fit in the interaction
data according
to R2-value is second order > first
order
> zero order; other details are given in Tables 2–4. The second-order
model was the best fit for this interaction, which indicated that
the rate-limiting step is controlled by a chemical reaction including
valence forces through electron exchange or sharing between the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
and Al(III) ions.49,50

Thermodynamics of Reactive
Interactions
To understand
the energy changes during the selective interaction of prepared nanoprobe
toward Al(III), thermodynamic studies were done at different temperatures.
Thermodynamic parameters were calculated by using activation energy
(eq 4), i.e., Arrhenius
relation.51 Thermodynamic data reveal the
nature of interaction, spontaneity, and feasibility 4  The activation
energies (Ea) for all ions are in the
order of Al(III) < Co(II)
< Hg(II) < Cr(III). This result indicates that the interaction
with Al(III) required less energy than other metal ions, and hence
the kinetics of Al(III) was much faster than that of other metal ions
(Figure 4). The Ea was 110.40 kJ/mol for Al(III), which was lower
than that for other ions. Other thermodynamic parameters of interaction
with all four metal ions were calculated by using eqs 5–7 5   6   7  All thermodynamic parameters were strongly
in favor of selective interaction of Al(III) with prepared nanoprobe,
and results are shown in Tables 5–7. The interaction was spontaneous, feasible, and endothermic.

Selectivity Study toward
Metal Ions
The application
of the prepared nanoprobe as a colorimetric sensor for metal-ion detection
is based on the spectral analysis along with color change of the NPs
solution. Thus, by applying this strategy, the selectivity of the
prepared nanoprobe was determined against 15 metal ions. There was
no significant change in the UV–vis spectra of any metal ion,
except Al(III), as shown in Figure 5a. The presence of Al(III) causes a red shift in the
SPR band. This indicates the interaction of Al(III) with the prepared
NPs, which results in the morphology change of the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs and
red shift in the SPR spectrum. Quantitative analysis was also performed
at two different absorption ratios (A452–410). Figure 5b demonstrates
an apparently high absorption ratio (A452–410) for Al(III), indicating the maximum aggregation state, whereas
other metal ions displayed an absorption ratio similar to that of
blank (untreated AgNPs). The effect of the coexisting metal ions on
the sensing efficiency was also determined by mixing different metal-ion
solutions (50 nM) with the Al(III) ions (10 nM). A coexisting metal
cation test was also demonstrated to examine the selectivity of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
toward Al(III). The colorimetric response of the reaction mixtures
is that the metal ions did not interfere in the detection of the Al(III)ions
(Figure 6a). The results
were also supported by the plot of the values obtained (A452–410 of the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs) with various metal
cations mixed with Al(III) (5–50 nM) (Figure 5c). The Al(III)-induced values were dramatically
larger than the values obtained for any of the other metal cations
(Figure 5c).

ranging from 50 to 5 nM.

changes of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs in the presence of Al(III) and various metal
ions.

A colorimetric nanoprobe is advantageous
as it does not require
complex instrumentation; the color change can be seen by the naked
eye. The proposed nanoprobe could be used as a visual colorimetric
nanosensor for the detection of metal ions. As observed in Figure 6b, only Al(III) can
significantly induce an aggregation to cause the color change in the
NPs solution, while other metal ions did not induce any such change
even at a concentration of 50 nM.

Sensitivity Study
To observe the response of nanoprobe
to Al(III) ions, various concentrations of Al(III) ranging from 0.1
to 50 nM were individually added to the NPs solutions. The corresponding
UV–vis spectra were recorded after 2 min of shaking time. The
effects of different concentrations of Al(III) ions on the prepared
NPs are demonstrated in Figure 7a. The SPR band of the NPs solutions was shifted to higher
wavelength, with increasing concentration of Al(III) ions. The band
intensity decreases gradually, along with a red shift, indicating
strong aggregation of NPs. Figure 7b shows that the color of the solution changes from
yellowish brown to yellow as a function of Al(III) ions. This reveals
that the visual detection of Al(III) ions is possible with our prepared
nanoprobe (Scheme 2). By plotting Al(III) concentration against A452–410, a straight line with R2 = 0.9903 in
the range of 1–50 nM was obtained (Figure 7c). Moreover, the color of NPs solution is
the same as that of control at 1 nM concentration of Al(III) ions.
These findings are well supported by the spectral analysis in which
no change in the SPR intensity was observed beyond 1 nM concentration
of Al(III) ions. Thus, the detection limit of Al(III) for the proposed
nanoprobe was found to be 1 nM.

images of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs
after the addition of different Al(III) ion concentration of 0.1–50
nM, and (c) plot of absorption intensity vs various concentrations
of Al(III).

The aggregation behavior
of the NPs in the presence of Al(III)
ions was further confirmed by the high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HRTEM) images. Figure 8 shows the change in the behavior of the NPs after
the addition of Al(III) ions. Figure 8a shows that the particles are well dispersed having
the size of 5–25 nm, whereas after the addition of the Al(III)
ions (Figure 7c), the
particles were aggregated (Figure 8b), thus changing their morphology from monodispersed
to polydispersed (Scheme 2). The interaction of NPs with Al(III) ions was further confirmed
by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The average diameter
of the particles changes from 26 to 110 nm after the addition of the
Al(III)ions (Figure S5a–c).

of 5H-I2CA@AgNPs (a) before and (b) after the addition
of Al(III) ions.

Thus, all of the aforementioned
results support the Al(III) ions-assisted
aggregation of prepared NPs solution. On the basis of the HRTEM images,
it was noted that the prepared NPs were sensitive to the Al(III) ions
and can be used for quantitative purposes.

XPS Analysis
The
preparation of the 5H-I2CA@AgNPs and
their selective interaction with the Al(III) ions were also determined
by the XPS analysis and results are tabulated in Table 8. The peaks observed at 368.81
and 374.85 eV attribute to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 orbits
of Ag0 prior to the addition of the Al(III) ions. The binding
energies of Ag changed after the addition of the Al(III) ions, and
the peaks observed at 367.60 and 373.62 eV (Figure 9c,d)52 are the
indication of the formation of silver oxide (Ag2O) after
the reaction of AgNPs with Al(III) ions. The strong peaks appeared
at about 72.9 and 74.6 eV in the Al 2p spectrum for Al(OH)3 and Al metal ion, respectively.53 These
peaks confirm the interaction of Al(III) over the surface of the NPs
(Figure 10). The C
1s spectrum can be deconvoluted at about 284.31, 285.66, and 288.55
eV corresponding to the C–C, carbon in C–O, and the
C=O. After adding the Al(III) ions, the binding energies of
C–C, C–O, and C=O were realized at 283.84, 285.12,
and 288.07 eV, respectively (Figure 11a,b). The three peaks appearing at 529.08, 530.11,
and 531.25 eV are the signals of O 1s of the metal per oxide anion,
M-OH, and −C=O group, respectively, and the shift toward
lower binding energies, i.e., 528.54, 530.17, and 531.72 eV, was observed
after the interaction with Al(III) ion (Figure 11c,d). Changes were also observed in the
spectra of NH from 399.6 to 398.2 eV, after the addition of Al(III)
ion (Figure 9a,b).
The binding energy changes are mainly attributed to the presence of
the Al–O bonds between AgNPs and Al(III) ions (Scheme 1).

Practical Application
To demonstrate that the prepared
nanoprobe can be used to detect Al(III) ions in real water samples,
a solution of the prepared NPs was used to detect Al(III) ions in
tap water. Then, different concentrations of the Al(III) ions were
introduced into the tap water samples and then added to the prepared
nanoprobe solution. The SPR spectra demonstrate that the SPR peak
intensity decreases with increasing concentration of Al(III)ions (Figure S6a). The change in the color of the prepared
nanoprobe in the water samples validates results as shown in Figure S6b. The prepared probe displayed good
linearity with the R2-value of 0.9902
with the tap water at minimum concentrations (Figure S6c). The sensitivity of the prepared nanosensor was
also compared to other methods available for the detection of Al(III).
It has been observed that the detection limit of the prepared NPs
is either superior or comparable to that of the available methods54,55 (see Table S1).

Conclusions
The 5H-I2CA@AgNPs that were prepared by a simple reduction method
have the capability to detect Al(III) ions over other tested metal
ions in aqueous solutions. With an increasing amount of Al(III) ions,
the prepared AgNPs tend to aggregate, resulting in a considerable
decrease in the absorption intensity and a visible color change from
yellowish brown to yellow. The obvious color change of the prepared
AgNPs can be easily observed via the naked eye. Under identical conditions,
the prepared nanoprobe displayed a good linearity over a wide range
of Al(III) concentrations with a correlation coefficient of 0.9903.
The kinetic study of selectivity of Al(III) was best fitted in a second-order
model with a rate constant of 0.81 au–1 min–1. Thermodynamic data reveal that interaction with
Al(III) with the probe was a feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic
process. The kinetic and thermodynamic data reveal that the Al(III)
best interacted with the prepared nanoprobe. The order for selectivity
was Al(III) > Co(II) > Hg(II) > Cr(III) ≅ Cr(VI).
This method
offers a new cost-effective, rapid, and simple solution for the detection
of the Al(III) ions in the real water samples also. Compared to traditional
methods available for Al(III) detection, the proposed method is advantageous
due to its simplicity, rapidity, high selectivity, and sensitivity.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Characterization Techniques
Several chemicals
used during the synthesis and experimental procedure of sensing, such
as silver nitrate (AgNO3), 5-hydroxy indole-2-carboxylic
acid (5H-I2CA), mercury chloride (HgCl2), barium chloride
(BaCl2), potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7), cadmium chloride (CdCl2), cobalt chloride
(CoCl2), lithium chloride (LiCl), manganese chloride (MnCl2), potassium chloride (KCl), nickel chloride (NiCl2), lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), zinc chloride (ZnCl2), aluminum chloride (AlCl3), ferric chloride (FeCl3), CrCl3, hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and lithium aluminum hydroxide (LiAlH4), were purchased
from Merck Pvt. Ltd. All of the chemicals were of analytical grade
and used as received without further purification. All solutions were
made in deionized water. All of the obtained chemicals were utilized
as received. The glassware was washed with aqua regia and then cleaned
with Millipore water before use. UV–vis absorption spectra
were recorded using a Lab India 3000+ UV–vis spectrophotometer
with a 1 cm quartz cell by using deionized water as the blank for
background correction. The thermal study was carried out by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA). The surface morphology was determined by high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) studies were performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern Instruments.
Thermo K-Alpha XPS instrument has been utilized for determining the
surface elemental composition of the samples. The elemental composition
was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The functional
group involved in the preparation of NPs was investigated by Fourier
transform infrared spectral studies.

Preparation of AgNPs
The preparation of NPs was done
by the method reported in the literature.38 Briefly, 50 mL of 1 × 10–3 M AgNO3 solution was boiled at 80 °C for 15 min. Then, 20 mL of 5H-I2CA
(1 × 10–2 M) was added to the AgNO3 solution under vigorous stirring. pH was maintained by adding 0.1
N NaOH solution. A rapid color change of the solution from light yellow
to yellowish brown was observed, indicating the preparation of well-dispersed
AgNPs. The as-prepared AgNPs were stable for months without any obvious
color change or aggregation.

Kinetics of Interaction
To understand
the kinetics
of the interaction between the prepared sensor and the metal ions,
absorbance of the mixed solution was measured at a fixed time interval.
In this experiment, 10 mL of each metal salt solution was mixed in
the prepared sensor and the absorbance of the mixed solution was analyzed
every 5 min to check any colorimetric changes.

Colorimetric Assay
For this, 300 μL of prepared
nanoprobe solution (5H-I2CA@AgNPs) was added to 500 μL of metal-ion
solutions and mixed systematically. The prepared nanoprobe solution
showed sensitivity toward Al(III), causing a change in the color of
the NPs solution from yellowish brown to yellow as well as a red shift
in their SPR spectrum. The practical applicability was checked by
tap water samples, which were collected from our laboratory.
