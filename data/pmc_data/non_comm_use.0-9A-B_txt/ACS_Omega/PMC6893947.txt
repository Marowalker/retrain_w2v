Searching for a highly efficient electrocatalyst for
the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution is still challenging.
In this work, we report a HER electrocatalyst composed of Ni foam,
Ni3S2, and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs). The good lattice matching between Ni
and Ni3S2, interstitial doping of C and N atoms,
and synergistic effect of NCNTs make NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs highly efficient HER electrocatalysts in alkaline solution.
NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs exhibit an overpotential of 93.89
mV at a current density of 10 mA cm–2, a Tafel slope
of 54 mV dec–1, and superior stability for HER in
1 M KOH solution. Our findings will promote the reasonable design
and synthesis of an efficient electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline
electrolytes.

Introduction
The demand for efficient energy conversion
is increasing because
of the depletion of fossil energy and serious environmental problems.1−4 Hydrogen has a broad prospect in the development of clean energy
because of its high energy density and environmental friendliness.5,6 It is worth noting that electrocatalysts have attracted more and
more attention because of their high energy conversion efficiency
and long-term cycle life.7−9 The electrolysis of water is considered
to be one of the most feasible methods to produce high purity hydrogen.10−12 However, the slow kinetics rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER) and the corresponding large amount of energy loss greatly decrease
the efficiency of water electrolysis, especially in alkaline solution.
Although platinum and platinum-based materials are the best catalysts
for HER at present, the cost of platinum seriously restricts its industrial
application.13 Therefore, it is imperative
to explore nonprecious metal catalysts with abundant reserves on earth
and high catalytic activity,14 such as
transition metal nitride,15,16 transition metal phosphide
(TMP),17,18 transition metal sulfide (TMS),19,20 and so on.

Recently, nanostructured nickel-based compounds
have attracted
great attention because of their high electrochemical activity for
HER.21−23 Nickel sulfide shows outstanding performance among
these nickel-based electrocatalysts for HER.24−27 However, the weak electrical
conductivity and poor chemical stability affect the electrochemical
performance of metal sulfide as an electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline
solution.28,29 In order to further improve the electrochemical
properties of metal sulfide, an effective method is to coat the surface
of the active material with a conductive polymer or porous carbon
to form an external conductive structure.30,31 Coupling with a conductive carbon material can greatly improve the
electron transfer rate and maintain the stability of the active material.
Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have the advantages of the
hollow structure, large specific surface area, and small density,
which can lead to fewer blocks on the active sites than other traditional
conductive carbon materials and even expose more active sites of catalysts.32

It is a good synthetic method to grow
the active material on the
conductive substrate. The obtained electrocatalysts do not need the
assistance of a chemical binder (such as Nafion solution) when tested
as the electrode. The chemical binder will increase the impedance
and influence the activity of catalysts. Nickel foam is a kind of
common and excellent conductive substrate material with a 3D porous
structure. Owing to its good conductivity, unique space structure,
large specific surface area, and low price, nickel foam becomes popular
as a conductive substrate material for electrocatalysts.

Based
on the above considerations, nickel sulfide grown in situ
on the surface of nickel foam was successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal
method first. NCNTs were grown on them subsequently by a chemical
vapor deposition method33 (CVD method)
to obtain nickel foam@nickel sulfide@NCNTs (NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs). The synthetic method of in situ growth makes the
connection between nickel foam and nickel sulfide quite tight, hence
the electron interaction between Ni and Ni3S2 is very strong, and nickel sulfide will almost not detach from nickel
foam after high-temperature heating. NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs show very high electrocatalytic activity for HER in alkaline
solution. The corresponding overpotential at the current density of
10 mA/cm2 (η10) in 1 M KOH solution is
only 93.89 mV, and the Tafel slope is as low as 54 mV dec–1. NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs also exhibit very low impedance
and superior electrochemical stability. These results prove that the
NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs we synthesized are an excellent
electrocatalyst for HER in alkaline solution.

Results and Discussion
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was used to characterize
the elemental valence distribution of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs. The Ni 2p XPS spectrum is shown in Figure 1a. The peaks of Ni 2p at 871.9 and 854.6
eV are similar to the peaks in the reported literature (870.1 and
852.9 eV),34 but they are shifted about
1.7 eV toward the direction of high electron binding energy. It indicates
that there are strong electron-attracting groups around the Ni atoms,
which causes electrons to flow from the Ni atoms to the strong electron-attracting
groups, increasing the electron binding energy of Ni 2p. After analysis,
the strong electron-attracting groups should be N atoms from NCNTs.
The N 1s XPS spectrum is shown in Figure 1c. Peaks at 401.1 and 398.9 eV can be attributed
to graphitic nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen, respectively. Graphitic
nitrogen is conducive to electronic transmission, and pyridine nitrogen
is believed to have certain catalytic activity for HER.35 The broad peak located between 162 and 164 eV
in the S 2p XPS spectrum (Figure 1b) is the overlap of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2.34

(b) S 2p XPS spectrum; (c) N 1s XPS spectrum;
(d) C 1s XPS spectrum; (e) Raman spectrum of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs; (f) XRD patterns of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs and NF@Ni3S2.

The Raman spectrum of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs is shown
in Figure 1e. The peaks
at 1591 and 1372 cm–1 are attributed to graphitic
carbon (G-band) and disorder carbon (D-band), respectively. The wide
peaks from 2600 to 3200 cm–1 are the overlaps of
2 times D-band, D-band + G-band, and 2 times G-band. As seen from Figure 1e, the intensity
of the G-band is strong, indicating that the sample has a high degree
of graphitization. The high degree of graphitization is beneficial
for charge transfer. The intensity ratio of the D band to G band (ID/IG) is 3.73 through
the calculation of the area integral. This ID/IG value is higher than that
reported in most literature studies,36,37 indicating
that the carbon material in NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs has
a large number of defects, which can help to expose the active sites
of the catalyst.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1f) of NF@Ni3S2 shows
conspicuous diffraction peaks located at 21.888, 31.190, 37.921, 44.651,
49.877, and 55.376°, corresponding to the (101), (110), (003),
(202), (113), and (122) planes of Ni3S2 (JCPDS
card no. 44-1418) and the diffraction peaks located at 44.651, 51.943,
and 76.512°, corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes
of Ni (JCPDS card no. 04-0850), confirming the composition of NF@Ni3S2. According to the two JCPDS cards, we can find
that Ni3S2 and Ni have good lattice matching,
such as dNi3S2(202)
≈ dNi(111); dNi3S2(205) ≈ dNi(220), and dNi3S2(404) ≈ dNi(222).
Especially, the strongest diffraction peak located at 44.651 is ascribed
to the overlay of the Ni3S2 (202) plane and
Ni(111) plane. On the basis of the reported work,38 the nanoconfinement effect occurs at the interface of two
in situ grown materials with lattice compatibly. Also, the nanoconfinement
effect has the advantage of facilitating charge transfer between two
pristine materials, which might be a common effect in metal–metal
sulfide or nitrides with lattice similarities. Therefore, the NF@Ni3S2 and NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs we
synthesized exactly conform to the conclusion that they have the nanoconfinement
effect for the enhancement of catalytic activity.

Compared to
the XRD pattern of NF@Ni3S2,
the intensity of the diffraction peaks assigned to Ni3S2 in the XRD pattern (Figure 1f) of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs are much
higher, indicating that the crystallinity of Ni3S2 is increased after high temperature calcination. The diffraction
peak located at 26.538° in the XRD pattern of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs represents carbon with a certain degree of crystallinity,
demonstrating the successful introduction of carbon sources in this
system. From Figure 1f, we can find that all the peaks assigned to Ni and Ni3S2 of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs are shifted
left to a lower 2θ value compared to those of NF@Ni3S2. XRD analysis is according to Bragg’s law39 1  where d(hkl) is the distance between crystal planes of (hkl), λ is the X-ray wavelength, and θ is the diffraction
angle of the crystal plane (hkl). Because the atomic
radius of C and N is smaller than that of S, the substitution of S
by C or S by N will cause a decrease in the d(hkl) value and an increase in 2θ values. Therefore,
the observed shift of the diffraction peak toward lower angles is
not because of the smaller d(hkl) expected for substitution of S by C or S by N. Instead, the increase
in d(hkl) may occur when C and N
atoms are doped in the crystal lattice of the material as interstitial
dopants. On this basis, the observed shift in 2θ indicates interstitial
doping with C and N atoms.40

TMSs
tend to sinter or aggregate because of the lattice strain
caused by atomic sulfur substitution,41 so finding a way to release the lattice strain can solve the problem
of sintering or aggregation. In our study, we find that interstitial
doping with C and N atoms can expand the lattice distance of Ni and
Ni3S2, which can offset the lattice strain resulted
from atomic sulfur substitution at high temperatures. To our knowledge,
this is the first time that the idea of using interstitial doping
to adjust the lattice strain of TMS has been put forward for HER,
and it can be a common solution for TMP or other catalytic materials
with the trouble of aggregation. Aggregation or expansion occurring
on nickel foam will make a big change in morphology because nickel
foam has a fluffy and elastic structure with plenty of space. Just
like a soft bread can be easily pressed into a variety of shapes while
a stone cannot. Figure 2a shows the contrast of NF@Ni3S2 and NF@Ni3S2 after being heated at 700 °C in a N2 atmosphere. As we can see from Figure 2a, the volume of NF@Ni3S2 has decreased by about 60% because of aggregation after at 700 °C
in a N2 atmosphere. While we put NF@Ni3S2 in a N2 atmosphere with g-C3N4 on the upstream under high temperature, the obtained NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs become nearly 70% bigger than pristine NF@Ni3S2 (shown in Figure 2b). The above results demonstrate that interstitial
doping in the crystal lattice of Ni and Ni3S2 with C and N atoms can stop the aggregation occurred in sulfuration
at high temperature effectively. Attributing to the morphological
change, the electrochemical active surface area (ESCA) of NF@Ni3S2@ NCNTs (32.17 mF cm–2) is
calculated to be about 30 times of that of NF@Ni3S2 (0.96 mF cm–2) as shown in Figure S1c. Also the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface of NF@Ni3S2@ NCNTs (Figure S1d) is 23.853 m2 g–1, which is much higher than that of NF@Ni3S2 (2.500 m2 g–1). The enlarged ESCA and
BET surface of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs demonstrate more
exposure of active sites.

NF@Ni3S2; (d,e) SEM images of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
with a relatively small and relatively high amount of C and N atoms
doped, respectively; and (f) TEM image of a NCNT.

Figure 2c–e
can illustrate the formation process of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs. Figure 2c
is the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of NF@Ni3S2. Figure 2d,e is the SEM images of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs with
a relatively small and relatively high amount of g-C3N4 as the C and N source, respectively. The surface of NF@Ni3S2 is smooth and flat (Figure 2c). With C and N atoms interstitially doped
gradually, the surface becomes rough and cracked (Figure 2d). When the doping content
reaches a certain amount, NCNTs start to grow and cover the whole
surface eventually (Figure 2e). Figure 2f is the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of a NCNT with
a diameter of about 600 nm. It is worth noting that although the doping
of C and N atoms is beneficial for solving the problem of aggregation,
excessive doping contents will make the structure of the samples to
expand too much and become brittle, which is not good for the next
measurements. We could control the doping amounts by adjusting the
dosage of g-C3N4 or the reaction time in high
temperature. More SEM images of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
with different amounts of C and N sources can be seen in Figure S2.

In traditional synthesis of
electrochemical catalytic material,
we used to grow the active material on an electroconductive substrate
(such as Ni foam, carbon cloth, titanium plate, and so on). However,
during the process of annealing, the separation of the active material
and substrate always happens because of their different thermal expansion
coefficients and loose connection. On the other typic synthesis way, we make the target catalyst into the form of
powder, and disperse catalyst onto a glassy carbon electrode with
the assistance of binder, for instance, Nafion solution. Nevertheless,
the binder will increase resistances of the catalyst and have a bad
impact on electrochemical performance. Here we employ the approach
of in situ growth on the substrate (more details in the Experimental Section). Ni3S2 in situ
grows on NF by a hydrothermal method using metallic nickel on the
surface of NF as a nickel source, and NCNTs grow in situ on the base
of NF@Ni3S2 via a CVD method. The connection
of NF, Ni3S2, and NCNTs is strong because of
in situ growth. Therefore, in situ growth on the substrate can avoid
the active material falling off in high temperature and have no need
of binders, which is in favor of the improvement of performance and
is convenient for test.

An old problem about TMS for electrochemical
catalysis is that
the in-plane S-sites and TM-Sites are generally considered inert.
Thus, exposing more edge sites or triggering the activity of the inert
in-plane sites can improve the catalytic performance of TMS. This
work has precisely done the two things. From Figure 2c–e, we can see that pure Ni3S2 grown in NF had a smooth surface (Figure 2c). With the doping of C and
N atoms and the growth of NCNTs gradually, more edges are exposed
attributing to the change of appearance (Figure 2d,e) with visible cracks. The interstitial
doping of C and N atoms can also adjust the lattice strain as we mentioned
before, and strain engineering is effective to trigger the inert basal
plane of the catalyst according to a published paper.42

The lattices of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
are visible
in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 3a). Lattice fringes with displacing values
of about 0.203, 0.206, and 0.288 nm correspond to the crystal planes
of Ni(111), Ni3S2(202), and Ni3S2 (110), respectively. The lattice in the outermost layer can
be assigned to graphite carbon, and this structure is agreed with
the reported material encapsulated in carbon nanotubes.43 There are distortions and defects observed in
the lattice of graphite carbon. It can be seen that the Ni(111) plane
and Ni3S2(202) plane are adjacent with a similar
lattice orientation and lattice distance. The lattice distance value
of the Ni(111) plane (0.203 nm) and Ni3S2(202)
plane (0.206 nm) correspond to the overlapping XRD diffraction peak
located at 44.3° of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs (Figure 1f). The interface
between the Ni(111) plane and Ni3S2(202) can
be observed in Figure 3a, having a nanoconfinement effect discussed before.38 The effect helps to inherit the functions of Ni and Ni3S2 and promotes the electron transfer between them
at the epitaxial interface. The fast Fourier transition image (Figure 3b) also reveals the
crystal planes of Ni(111) and Ni3S2(202), confirming
the high lattice compatibility of the two crystal planes.

TEM image of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs; (d–h) EDS
maps of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs corresponding to the
HAADF STEM image shown in the inset of (d).

The structure of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs was further
characterized by TEM. As shown in Figure 3c, NF@Ni3S2 particles
are embedded in an ultra-thin carbon layer, which has graphene-like
properties. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps of NF@Ni3S2@ NCNTs (Figure 3d–h) confirm the core–shell structure
of the sample: Ni particles located inside, Ni3S2 is in the middle layer, and NF@Ni3S2 is surrounded
by nitrogen and carbon elements. The TEM results illustrate the formation
mechanism of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs. The outside of
metal Ni was turned to Ni3S2 at first. Then
NF@Ni3S2 was embedded in a N-doped carbon layer.
With the increasing amount of the C and N source, NCNTs began to grow
on the outside.

The above XRD and HRTEM results have proved
the good lattice matching
of metal Ni and Ni3S2, and good lattice matching
promotes electron interaction between Ni and Ni3S2. The calculation results are shown in Figure 4. Because the Fermi level of Ni is higher
than that of Ni3S2, it is concluded that the
electron transfer is from Ni to Ni3S2. The adsorption
energy of H on Ni3S2 changes after the electrons
are obtained: the free energy of the S site becomes larger, and the
free energy of the Ni site decreases, and because the Ni site is generally
stronger than the S site, Ni is the main active center. However, the
overall adsorption of Ni3S2 is weak, and the
enhancement of the Ni–H bond is beneficial to hydrogen evolution,
so the catalytic performance of the material is improved. More details
of calculation can be seen in Supporting Information.

Figure 4 Calculation results of free energy for HER. Ni3S2–Ni, Ni3S2–S, Ni3S2––Ni, and Ni3S2––S represent the Ni site of Ni3S2, S site of Ni3S2, Ni site
of Ni3S2 that gains electrons, and S site of
Ni3S2 that gains electrons, respectively.

Figure 5a shows
linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs, NF@Ni3S2, pure NF, and commercial Pt–C
in 1 M KOH solution with a scanning rate of 5 mV·s–1. The η10 of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs,
NF@NCNTs, NF@Ni3S2, pure NF, and commercial
Pt–C is 93.89, 126, 293, 328, and 45 mV, respectively. The
LSV results show that the catalytic activity of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs for HER is much higher than that of NF@Ni3S2 and pure NF, and close to commercial Pt–C. However,
the catalytic behavior of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs under
a large potential is even better than that of commercial Pt–C,
and the catalytic activity of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
is also excellent compared to that of other similar transition-metal
catalysts for HER in alkaline solution, as shown in Table S1. NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs also show excellent
electrochemical catalytic performance for HER in acidic solution.
The η10 of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs in
0.5 M H2SO4 is only 68 mV, as shown in Figure 5b.

NF, and commercial Pt–C in 1 M

1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4; (c) Tafel plots of

at 10 mA·cm–2 in 1 M KOH; and (f) the cycle
stability measurement of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs via
a CV scanning for 1000 cycles in 1 M KOH solution.

The Tafel slopes of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs, NF@Ni3S2, and commercial Pt–C
are applied to further
explore the HER activity of the materials. As shown in Figure 5c, the Tafel slopes of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs, NF@Ni3S2, and commercial
Pt–C are 54, 141, and 28 mV dec–1, respectively.
It is clear that the Tafel slope of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs is much lower than that of NF@Ni3S2,
so the catalytic activity of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
has a great improvement compared to that of NF@Ni3S2. Figure 5d
shows the ac impedance diagram of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
and NF@Ni3S2. As can be seen from Figure 5d, the charge transfer resistance
(Rct) of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs (3.2 Ω) is far below that of NF@Ni3S2 (≈120 Ω), showing metal-like electrical conductivity.
The ultralow resistance should benefit from the highly conductive
NCNTs. For long-term test, a chronopotentiometry measurement was carried
out at 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH solution for 35 h.
The stability of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs shown in Figure 5e is robust with
a small overpotential increase of ≈30 mV after 35 h. The cycling
stability measurement of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs was
carried out in 1 M KOH solution via a CV scanning for 1000 cycles.
As displayed in Figure 5f, NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs show high cycling stability
with the LSV curve hardly changed after the CV scanning for 1000 cycles.
The stability testing at a higher current density and the XPS and
SEM characterizations of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs after
the long-time reaction are provided in Figure S4, confirming the stability of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs. Therefore, NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs we synthesized
are a great electro-chemical catalyst for HER in alkaline solution
with high activity, low resistance, and robust stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized
NF@Ni3S2@ NCNTs as a high active electrocatalyst
for HER in alkaline
solution. Ni3S2 grew in situ on the surface
of NF by a hydrothermal method first, and then NCNTs were coupled
with NF@Ni3S2 subsequently by a CVD method.
NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs show a small overpotential of
93.89 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 and a low Tafel
slope of 54 mV dec–1 in 1 M KOH solution for HER.
The charge transfer resistance of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
is only 3.2 Ω. What is more, NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
show a superior long-term stability and cycling stability. The excellent
electro-chemical performance benefits from the following innovations:
(1) The method of in situ growth makes the connection between NF,
Ni3S2, and NCNTs strong, which can prevent the
active material from falling off the substrate under high temperature
conditions, and does not need the use of a binder to assist electrochemical
testing; (2) interstitial doping of C and N atoms can regulate lattice
stress and solve the agglomeration problem of metal sulfide caused
by lattice stress at high temperature. The highly conductive NCNTs
help our catalyst to have low resistance and strong stability; (3)
the good lattice matching of Ni and Ni3S2 promotes
the electron interaction between Ni and Ni3S2 and improves intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The unique synthesis
method exposes more active edge sites for HER. Thus, NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs are an outstanding electro-chemical catalyst
for HER in alkaline solution. This work will boost the development
of nonprecious metal catalysts for HER in alkaline electrolytes.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of g-C3N4
All chemical
reagents in this work were of analytical grade and were used without
any purification. g-C3N4 powder was prepared
by calcining melamine as a precursor under high temperature. In details,
2 g of melamine was placed in a quartz boat and calcined in air at
550 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1.

Synthesis of NF@Ni3S2
Ni foam
was cut into regular pieces in a size of 2 cm × 1 cm. Ni foam
was treated with diluted HCl, ethanol, and deionized water before
use. Thiourea (0.3 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized water. Subsequently,
the above solution and four pieces of Ni foam were transferred into
a 50 mL Teflon stainless autoclave. The Teflon stainless autoclave
was then put into an oven and reacted at a temperature of 120 °C
for 6 h.

Synthesis of NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs
We
used a CVD method to prepare NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs.
The as-prepared NF@Ni3S2 was placed inside a
quartz boat in the middle of the furnace, and g-C3N4 was placed inside a quartz boat on the upper side of the
furnace. The furnace was heated at 700 °C for 2 h with a heating
rate of 5 °C min–1 under a flowing nitrogen
atmosphere (50 mL/min). NF@Ni3S2 was calcined
under the same conditions except using g-C3N4 as the carbon and nitrogen source for performance contrast.

Characterizations
The composition and crystallinity
of samples were characterized by powder XRD (D-MAX 2200 VPC) on an
X’Pert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. XPS
measurements were performed on an ESCALAB MKII with a Mg source. SEM
images were measured by a FEI Quanta-400 scanning electron microscope.
TEM characterizations were carried out on a FEI TECNAI F30 transmission
electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 300 kV, including
the TEM image, HRTEM image, scanned TEM-EDS (STEM-EDS) element mapping,
and so on. Raman spectra were recorded on a Renishaw inVia Raman Instrument.

Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical measurements
were carried out in a three-electrode system using a CHI 760D electrochemical
station at room temperature. The prepared NF@Ni3S2 and NF@Ni3S2@NCNTs were used as the working
electrodes. A mercuric oxide electrode and a graphite rod served as
the reference and counter electrode, respectively. LSV polarization
curves were measured at a scan rate of 5 mV·s–1 in 1.0 M KOH solution. Longer-term cycling stability and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were all tested in an electrolyte
of 1.0 M KOH solution. EIS measurements were performed at a frequency
between 100 kHz and 0.01 Hz. All the potential in this work were referenced
to a reversible hydrogen electrode.
