The paper reports
the time-domain THz spectroscopy studies of noncentrosymmetric
energetic nitro/nitrogen-rich aryl-tetrazole high-energy molecules.
The fingerprint spectra in the THz domain reveal the role of different
functional groups attached to position “1” of the tetrazole
moiety, which controls the energetic properties. These responses are
deliberated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
The synthesized aryl-tetrazoles exhibit high positive heat of formation
(369–744 kJ/mol), high detonation velocities, and pressures
(Dv: 7734–8298 m·s–1; Dp: 24–28 GPa) in comparison
to the noncentrosymmetric 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). These compounds
exhibit variation in the refractive indices and absorption between
0.1 and 2.2 THz range. The DFT studies at the molecular and single-crystal
level (using plane wave pseudo potential method) endorse in detecting
these bands (with ∼1% deviation). The calculated vibrational
frequencies and linear optical properties are found to have good agreement
with the experimental data in UV–visible and THz regions.

Introduction
The
electromagnetic radiation between 0.1 and 3.0 THz range receives
special attention in telecommunication industries because of broad
band communication. In addition, it has the ability to pass through
paper, leather, plastic, rubber, and different types of organic nonpolar
packing materials including semiconductors, explosives, drugs, and
biomolecules without ionizing the test sample. Therefore, THz-based
spectroscopy and imaging are an effective means for detection of concealed
objects and play a very significant role in home land security, defence,
and medical fields. Because the THz spectrum lies between 100 and 5.0 cm–1 range which covers
the weak vibrational frequency of organic molecules, the technique
provides important information about the structural dynamics and intermolecular
vibrations of high energy molecules (HEMs) and also helps to assign
the periodicity of the materials through polymorphism and phase transition.1−5

In view of the importance of the time-domain THz spectroscopy technique and
density functional theory (DFT)-based theoretical approach help us
to study the structure–properties and correlation of HEMs.17,18 Our group has also explored different types materials such as LT/SIGaAs-based
photoconductive antenna and organic and semiconductor crystals for
THz generation and its application in time-domain spectroscopy of
HEMs.19−22 Because tetrazole derivatives show superior energetic properties
as compared to the other five-membered azole moieties because of high
contents of nitrogen and higher value of positive heat of formation,
their physical properties are comparable with premium explosives like
Research department explosive (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).6−10,27,28 However, most of the reported tetrazole derivatives are very sensitive
to impact and friction.11−13 Pellizzeri et al.35 reported the polymorphic characterization of
5(4-pyridyl)tetrazole using time-domain THz spectroscopy and solid-state
DFT. A deliberation for the synthesis of nitro/nitroamino/azido-substituted
aryl tetrazole derivatives, such as 2,6-dinitro-4-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)aniline (C7H5N7O4) (6), N-(2,6-dinitro-4-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)phenyl)nitramide (C7H4N8O6) (7), 1-(3,4,5-trinitrophenyl)-1H-tetrazole (C7H3N7O6)
(8), and 1-(4-azido-3,5-dinitrophenyl)-1H-tetrazole
(C7H3N9O4) (9) are recently
reported because these compounds exhibit better energetic properties
than TNT and are comparable to RDX. The important parameters are comprised
in Table 1. It is interesting
to see that all these reported compounds are crystalline in nature
and can be used as an energetic plasticizer in rocket propulsion applications
because of their good oxygen balance (OB %). For example, compounds
“6”, “7”, “8”, and “9”
possess OB (%) of the order of −79.62, −54.02, −54.06,
and −66.38%, respectively. In addition, their corresponding
densities ρ (in g·cm–3), high detonation
velocities Dv (in m·s–1) and detonation pressure Dp (in GPa)
are shown in Table 1. We also compared the important chemical and physical parameters
with well-known energetic plasticizer, that is, bis(2-fluoro-2,2-diniroethyl)formal
(it possess OB % = −74.0%, Dv =
7500 m·s–1, Dp =
25 GPa).14 However, the functional group
attached to position “1” of the molecule as shown in Figure 1 not only influences
the energetic properties of the molecules but also is responsible
for the transition of crystalline to the amorphous phase which is
also reflected in terms of change in the refractive index and absorption
coefficient. Moreover, all these aryl-tetrazole derivatives are noncentrosymmetric
with space groups P21/C and P212121. Therefore,
we intended to study the structure–property correlations of
these molecules through experiments and theory. This will help us
in examining the potential of terahertz generation, detection, and
nonlinear optical (NLO) response. Here, we have discussed the THz
time-domain, UV–visible spectroscopic studies of the energetic
polynitro-arene-tetrazole derivatives.15 The possible reasons behind the optical response through DFT calculations
both at molecular and solid levels are also provided. The experimental
crystal structures are shown in Figure 1, and the corresponding energetic properties are comprised
in Table 1 for reference.

Experimental Setup and Sample Preparation
The sample
pellets of 12 mm diameter of weight 500 mg were prepared
by mixing 100 mg of sample with 400 mg of Teflon [polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE)] powder. Particle sizes are comparable with far infrared (FIR)
wavelength which leads to scattering losses from the surface of the
pellets. This can be minimized by mixing the compound and PTFE powder
with ethanol solution and subsequently grounding with mortar to make
a homogeneous mixture. The mixture was dried for half an hour before
subjecting to press mills. The whole mixture was loaded into a die
and pressed with 2 tons of hydraulic pressure. The diameter and thickness
of pellets are 12 and 2mm, respectively. A pure Teflon pellet of identical
size is also prepared for reference. Figure 2 shows the experimental layout of THz generation
and detection. A Ti:sapphire laser-tunable oscillator laser with pulse
duration 140 fs at a repetition rate of 80 MHz (coherent chameleon
ultra-II made) was used as a pumping source. Using a 90:10 beam splitter,
the laser beam was split into a pump and probe. A transmitted pump
beam is used for pumping the ZnTe crystal for terahertz generation.
It is generated by the optical rectification process. A Teflon sheet
was used for filtering out the undesirable pump wavelength from terahertz.
A half axis parabolic mirror is used to collimate and focus the generated
THz radiation for detection using a photoconductive antenna (gap ≈
5 μm, length ≈ 20 μm). In the detection arm, the
reflected beam is passed through a linear translation stage and loosely
focused on detecting antenna. The photoconductive antenna is connected
to a low-noise current preamplifier which is fed to the lock-in amplifier
(Stanford Research Systems, model no. SR830). A mechanical chopper
operating at 1.5 kHz is used as a reference to the lock-in amplifier
(Stanford Research Systems, model no. SR830). The data acquisition
and motion control of delay stage are done by software using LabView
program. All measurements were carried out at room temperature under
ambient conditions. The THz temporal profile is measured by changing
the delay of probe beam with respect to the THz pulse reaching to
the antenna. Initially, the scan was done without any sample followed
by pure Teflon pellet mounted in front of the antenna. The temporal
data are converted to the frequency domain by performing fast Fourier
transform (FFT). Material parameters like spectral transmittance,
phase, and absorption coefficient are obtained from frequency domain
data, whereas the refractive index can be obtained from both temporal
and spectral data without using the Kramers–Kronig relation. Figure 3 shows terahertz
temporal profile and corresponding FFT of air and Teflon pellet are
shown in the inset.

setup.

Figure 3 (a)Time-domain THz spectra of tetrazole molecules,
(b) corresponding
frequency domain spectra.

Refractive index (n(ω)) and absorption
coefficient
(α(ω)) were calculated from the FFT spectrum.23 The intensity ratio of the transmitted radiation
from the sample and reference provides the actual transmittance of
the sample pellets and is given by eq 1 1  

It is related to
the complex refractive index N = n + ik, where the real part
corresponds to the refractive index and the imaginary part is molar
absorptivity. For measurement of the complex refractive index between
0.1 and 2.6 THz range, we have calculated the effective thickness
of the sample distributed in the Teflon matrix using eq 2. 2  here, m = weight
of the sample
(100 mg), D = diameter of sample (12 mm), and ρ
is density of the sample. Figure 2 shows the time-domain spectrum of explosive molecules.
Because the pellets contain a mixture, the absorption coefficient
(α) is calculated using eq 3. 3  where “l” is
the effective thickness of the sample and Tm and TR are the spectra of THz transmitted
through material and reference samples, respectively. Because the
particle sizes of both Teflon powder and sample are very small compared
with the wavelength of radiation, one can neglect scattering losses.
The refractive index is calculated using eq 4. 4  where δπ
is the phase difference between reference and sample, ν is frequency, d is thickness of pellet, and c is the
velocity of light.

Theoretical Methods
The solid-level
theoretical calculations are performed with Cambridge
Series of Total Energy (CASTEP) program,29,30 whereas the molecular-level calculations are done with Gaussian-03
code. We have considered the experimental crystal structures reported
by Kommu et al.15 as input and optimized
the systems using Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
algorithm31 with convergence thresholds
for energy, force, stress, and maximum displacements as 5.0 ×
10–6 (eV/atom), 0.01 eV/Å, 0.02 GPa, and 5.0
× 10–4 Å, respectively. The electronic
Hamiltonian with the plane wave basis set with cutoff energy 550 eV,
ultrasoft (US) pseudopotentials (for electron–ion interactions),32 self-consistent field threshold 5.0 × 10–6 (eV/atom) with 3 × 5 × 3 Monkhorst–Pack33k-mesh (15 irreducible k-points) in the reciprocal space is used. Generalized gradient
approximation (GGA), Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),34 and dispersion correction Grimme (G06) scheme36 are used to treat the strong and weak electron–electron
interactions. The G06-optimized structure is used for linear optical
property (absorption and refractive index spectra’s) calculations.
The zone centre vibrational properties (infrared (IR)-spectra) are
calculated using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)38,39 approach by utilizing the norm conserving pseudopotentials40 with 830 eV cutoff energy. The valence electrons
of the constituent atoms are considered as follows: H (1s1), N(2s2 2p3), C (2s2 2p2), O (2s2 2p4). The gas-phase single-molecule
geometry optimizations and vibrational properties calculations are
done using the B3LYP (Becke, 3-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr)
functional41,42 with 6-311+G(d, p) polarized
basis set as implemented in Gaussian-03.24

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure and Terahertz Time-Domain
Response
All the chosen compounds (C7H5N7O4) (6), (C7H4N8O6) (7), (C7H3N7O6) (8), and (C7H3N9O4)
(9) for the present study crystallize in noncentrosymmetric space
groups with monoclinic symmetry except compound “8”
which is orthorhombic.15 These materials
consist of z = 4 formula units/unit cell (i.e., compound
“6”—92; compound “7”—100;
compound “8”—92; and compound “9”—92
atoms/unit cell). Moreover, all of the atoms of compounds 6, 7, and
9 are located at “4e” atomic Wyckoff sites, whereas
in compound “8”, atoms are occupying “4a”
Wyckoff site with full occupancy. Because of the change in the explosive
functional groups (i.e. NH2, NH–NO2,
NO2, N3) of these tetrazole derivatives, the
lattice vectors show an increment in the following order: lattice
vector “a”: from compound “8”
→ “7” → “6” → “9”;
lattice vector “b”: from compound “9”
→ “6” → “8” → “7”;
lattice vector “c”: from compound “7”
→ “6” → “9” → “8”;
and lattice angle β: from compound “8” →
“7” → “6” → “9”.
From the experimental crystal structure, it is clear that all the
studied compounds are naturally layered. The corresponding layers
of compounds 6, 7, 8, and 9 are spread over xz, xy, yz, and xz planes,
and the adjacent layers are stacked along x, y, z, and x directions.
The change in the chemical composition and symmetry resulted in huge
difference in their explosive nature (see Table 1) and stability. Moreover, the increase in
the nitrogen and oxygen percentage in the studied compounds will definitely
lead to change in their polarization. Hence, the noncentrosymmetric
nature and change in the number of electrons strongly motivated us
to investigate their terahertz optical responses, which are believed
to be useful for their detection and nonlinear applications. The same
was carried out using a time-domain terahertz spectroscopy setup.

The corresponding absorption spectra results of the studied compounds
are shown in Figure 4. It is clear from the figure that (1) all of the compounds start
absorbing radiation from 0.5 THz and high intensity absorption peaks
are found between 1.0 and 2.5 THz range. (2) The studied materials
show absorption in 0.5–2.5 THz energy window as follows: for
compound “6”—0.65, 0.89, 1.13, 1.49, 1.79, 1.97,
2.33 THz; for compound “7”—0.65, 1.37, 1.49,
1.91, 2.27 THz; for compound “8”—1.01, 1.19,
1.49, 1.79, 1.97, 2.27 THz; and for compound “9”—0.53,
1.01, 1.13, 1.37, 1.67, 1.91, 2.15, 2.33 THz. (3) Among these, compound “7”
shows highest intensity peaks and hence is more polarizable, whereas
compound “9” shows well-defined absorption peaks and
hence is relatively more sensitive and easy to detect even at lower
energies. (4) Moreover, the detection limit of the studied tetrazole
compounds got increased from NH–NO2 → NH2 → NO2 → N3 explosive
functional groups. These unique absorption spectra of studied compounds
are considered to be their fingerprint spectra’s in the terahertz
domain. To understand these absorption peak frequency and intensity
differences more clearly, we extended our focus toward the vibrational
mode analysis using DFT calculations both at molecular and solid levels.

Figure 4 Experimental
tera-hertz time-domain absorption spectra of 6, 7,
8, and 9. The calculated molecular level vibrational frequencies with
Gaussian-03 are displayed as straight lines.

In the first step, we performed the molecular vibrational
spectra
calculations by using B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) polarized basis set as implemented
in Gaussian-03.24 We have considered the
experimental single-crystal X-ray diffraction structure as our input.
The obtained frequencies do not show any imaginary part, which confirm
the dynamical stability of all the studied compounds, and the corresponding
results are plotted in Figure 5. The FIR absorption peaks of studied tetrazole molecules
between 0.1 and 2.2 THz frequency window are observed at the following
frequencies (as shown in Figure 5): for compound “6”—1.13, 1.36
THz; for compound “7”—1.08, 1.58, 2.09 THz; for
compound “8”—0.95, 2.02 THz; and for compound
“9”—0.47, 1.15, 2.07 THz. The obtained results
show considerable deviation with respect to the experimentally measured
frequencies. However, it is known that the vibrational spectrum in
the THz range depends primarily on the structure of molecules and
their intra- and intermolecular interaction. The weak interaction
of molecules and intermolecular force result in the collective vibration
mode under the THz range frequency. The low-frequency vibration in
the THz range normally comes from the deformation, torsion, and bending
of two or more molecules. As we performed the DFT calculations at
the single-molecule level, the obtained vibrational spectrum in the
0.2–2.2 THz region can be attributed to the intramolecule vibrations
alone. The preliminary mode analysis informs that the absorption peak
of compound “6” located at 1.13 THz is attributed to
torsional rotation of tetrazole moieties, and other two frequencies
are due to wagging of NO2 groups attached to the ring.
The peak of compound “7” at 1.08 THz is attributed to
torsional rotation of the tetrazole moiety. Similarly, the reduction
in the first absorption peak (red shift) of compounds “7”(1.08),
“8”(0.95), “9”(0.47) when compared to
compound 6(1.13) are due to increase of the additional nitro group
reduced mass of the molecule. The mode at 2.02 THz of compound “8”
is attributed to the rotation of twist of NO2, and the
calculated low-frequency 0.95 THz mode is not clearly observed in
the experimental spectrum, which could be due to the scattering losses.
In case of compound “9”, mode at 0.47 THz is observed
due to collective rotation twists of all attached azide groups to
the ring. Torsional rotation of the tetrazole moiety was observed
at 1.15 THz. A torsional rotation of all functional groups except
for tetrazole was observed theoretically at 2.07 THz. The difference
in the intensity profiles of the studied molecules (Figure 5b) indicates the increment
in the polarizability from compounds “6” → “9”
→ “8” → “7”, which is contradicting
with the experimental observations. However, the observed discrepancy
between experimental and theoretical vibrational frequencies could
be due to the omission of the effects from intermolecular interaction
and temperature. Hence, we turned our attention to the solid-state-level
DFT calculations of the present compounds of interest to incorporate
the role of intermolecular interactions.

(b) single-crystal zone center vibrational
(IR) spectra in 0.1–2.2 THz region of 6, 7, 8, and 9 using
PBE + G06 dispersion-corrected method at the theoretical equilibrium
structure.

Initially, we optimized the experimental
layered noncentrosymmetric
crystal structures15 using the GGA-PBE
exchange correlation functional34 as implemented
in CASTEP.29,30 The calculated ground-state lattice
vectors, angles, and volumes along with experimental data are shown
in Table 2. The obtained
results show considerable deviation as compared to the experimental
data and are as follows: for compound “6” → a(14.1%) > c(7.8%) > b(2.0%); for compound “7” → c(7.1%) > b(6.6%) > a(3.9%);
for
compound “8” → a(9.0%) > b(5.2%) > c(4.1%); and for compound
“9”
→ c(9.7%) > a(5.5%) > b(2.1%). The crystals volume and crystallographic angles
deviations are as follows: V: for compound “8” (25.4%)
> “9” (23.8%) > “6” (20.6%) >
“7”
(16.8%) and β: for compound “6” (5.0%) > “7”
(4.7%) > “9” (4.6%); these results also reveal that
the intermolecular interactions are dominant in the studied layered
compounds as follows: for compound “6” (in xz plane) > “9” (in zx plane) >
“8”
(in xy plane) > “7” (in zx plane). This can be attributed to the difference in the
arrangement
of molecules in corresponding unit cells. As the vibrational properties
are very sensitive to the lattice vectors, it is important to optimize
the crystal’s structure to a better accuracy by including various
interatomic interactions.35,48 Hence, to capture the
weak interlayer nonbonded interactions [van der Waals (vdW), hydrogen
bond], we optimized all the crystal structures with the dispersion-corrected
Grimme functional, that is, PBE + G06.36 The obtained results show very good agreement with the experimental
data, and the deviations of all of the obtained lattice vectors, volumes,
and β values are around ∼1% (see Table 2). Hence, the G06 optimization results confirm
the crucial role of weak nonbonded interactions for finding the optimized
structures. We have used these (G06) structures for our further vibrational
property calculations which are very sensitive to the lattice vectors.

We have calculated the zone
centre vibrational frequencies of all
the compounds using DFPT approach. All of the required mode assignments
from 0.1 to 2.2 THz are done, and the corresponding results are shown
in Table 3. The compounds
6, 7, and 9 are isostructural and crystallized in the same point group
with C2h(2/m) symmetry with z = 4 formula units (98 atoms/unit
cell) except for compound “8” which is getting crystallized
in D2(222) point group symmetry with 100
atoms/unit cell. Hence, there will be 276 – 3 = 273 vibrational
modes for 6, 7, and 9 and 300 – 3 = 297 modes for compound
“8”. The group theory37 representation
for these acoustic (appear due to in-phase moment of atoms) and optical
(appear due to out of phase moment of atoms) modes will be as follows

a Here, IR active modes are denoted
as “I”, Raman active modes are denoted as “R”,
and IR + Raman active modes are denoted as “I + R”.

The calculated optical vibrational
modes (273, 297) of the compounds
are in good agreement with group theory representations. Among the
273 optical modes of compounds “6” and “9”,
135 (68Au ⊕ 67Bu) are found to be IR
(I) active and 138 modes (68Au ⊕ 67Bu) are found to be Raman (R) active. In case of compound “7”,
out of 297 optical modes, 147 modes (74Au ⊕ 73Bu) are found to be IR active and 150 modes (75Ag ⊕ 75Bg) are Raman active. Interestingly, for compound
“8”, out of 273 optical modes, 69A1 modes
are found to be purely Raman active and 204 modes (68B1 ⊕ 68B2 ⊕ 68B3) are found to
be both IR + Raman (I + R) active. Hence, we conclude that compound
“8” is highly polarizable (more optically active) among
the studied compounds. Because our current focus is on the terahertz
response (0.1–2.2 THz range), mode assignments are done for
these frequencies and the results are shown in Table 3. The corresponding vibrational spectra (IR)
in 0.1–2.2 THz range is plotted in Figure 5. The snapshots of few vibrational modes
are given in Figure 6 for future reference.

Figure 6 Few snapshot images of calculated vibrational
frequencies (in cm–1) at the solid level using PBE
+ G06.

The mode assignment analysis reveals
that the obtained frequencies
of all the compounds between 0.1 and 2.2 THz range are mainly arising
due to complete lattice translation associated with NO2 groups and N3 asymmetric stretching (see Figure 6), because of which asymmetric
stretching in Tetrazole ring and trinitrobenzene has been observed.
Few of the experimentally observed modes are well matched with the
calculated symmetry-based IR frequencies (see Table 3). The main possible reasons for the observed
discrepancies between theory and experimental frequencies and different
broadening of the modes could be due to different scattering and temperature
effects. Further, we have compared the experimental, solid-phase vibrational
frequencies shown in Table 3 with the molecular phase. The results clearly indicate that
most of the solid-level calculations match with the experimentally
observed frequencies. The observed shift between the molecular-level
and solid-level vibrational frequencies clearly indicates the dominant
role of weak intermolecular, interlayer interactions via vdW and hydrogen
bonding. To compare the intensity differences of the calculated frequencies,
we have plotted the IR spectra in Figure 5. It is clear from the figure that intensities
of the observed frequencies are dominant in the following order: compound
“9” > “8” > “6” >
“7”.
Hence, we can conclude that because of the different charge transfer
mechanism of the azide group in the low-energy region, compound “9”
is showing high peak intensity (polarizability) and hence is optically
more sensitive. Similarly, in compound “8”, because
of the presence of an extra NO2 group, electrons associated
with all I + R active modes, it is showing next high polarizability.
In case of compound “7”, because of the presence of
a strong N–N bond, we could observe only one peak in the studied
terahertz range with lowest intensity among the studied compounds.
However, compound “6” has weak C–N and H–N
bonds because of which we are getting a good number of vibrational
modes in the low energy region (<2.2 THz). Overall, we can conclude
that because of the different charge transfer mechanisms, compound “9”
possesses high optical sensitive (therefore unstable) nature, whereas
compound “7” shows low optical sensitivity (highly stable)
among the studied compounds. Other compounds show similar optical
sensitivity in the studied region. In conclusion, it is easy to detect
compound “8” and is optically stable than other studied
noncentrosymmetric compounds. Hence, it may find possible applications
in nonlinear optical domain also. Therefore, we further extended our
attention to investigate the refractive index and birefringence of
these compounds in the 0.1–2.2 THz range which is a crucial
parameter for obtaining proper phase matching in any nonlinear optical
applications.

UV–Visible Response, Refractive Index,
and Birefringence
The nitro/nitrogen-rich aryl-tetrazoles
crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric
space group, and it is very important to know the role of electronic
contributions in the optical properties such as absorption, band gap,
refractive index, and birefringence in the optical region of interest.
Moreover, the THz-based study is meant for detection of explosives
without ionizing the sample. Initially, we measured the absorption
spectra of compounds using the UV/visible/NIR spectrometer (model:
Cary 5000 with UMA attachment), and obtained results are compared
with the theoretically calculated absorption spectra in [0 0 1] direction
using the PBE-GO6 equilibrium structure as shown in Figure 7. The experimental results
confirm that compound “6” possesses a sharp absorption
peak around 480 nm (2.58 eV), whereas absorption bands of other compounds
such as “7”, “8”, and “9”are
located at 450 nm (2.75 eV), 350 nm (3.54 eV), and 410 nm (3.02 eV),
respectively. However, sharp absorption peaks for compounds “7”,
“8”, and “9” are observed at 320 nm (3.87
eV), 280 nm (4.42 eV), and 475 nm (2.61 eV). This broadening may be
attributed to the phonon contribution in optical transition (i.e.,
due to indirect band gap). However, the theoretically obtained absorption
spectra show that sharp absorption peaks for compounds “6”,
“7”, “8”, “9” are located
at 1.3, 1.2, 1.2, and 1.0 to 2.5 eV, respectively. The broadening
of the absorption peak of compound “9” is attributed
to the indirect band gap. Finally, it is clear from the experimental
and theoretical results that the studied compounds possess a strong
absorption band in the near-IR and THz region. Further, we have also
calculated the frequency-dependent complex refractive index between
0.1 and 2.2 THz using eq 4. Etalon effects caused due to internal reflection
were ineffective since we have not taken into account while calculating
FFT. First, we have calculated the refractive index of Teflon by taking
air as the reference.25,26Figure 3 shows the refractive index of Teflon between 0.1 and 2.2 THz range,
and the value is 1.4 which is in good agreement with the literature
values. Similarly, we calculated the average refractive index for
compounds 6, 7, 8, and 9 (see Figure 8) and the obtained corresponding values are 1.65, 1.71,
1.72, and 1.81, respectively. We further verified these calculations
by comparing with DFT results (see Figure 9). The calculations are done with great accuracy
using US pseudopotentials, 380.0 eV energy cutoff, and 3 × 5
× 3 k-grid. As the chosen compounds crystallized
in asymmetric space groups (monoclinic, orthorhombic), we could get
different values of nx, ny, and nz curves. All of the obtained results
(experiment, DFT) within 0.1–2.2 THz energy window show reasonable
agreement (Table 4),
and the same are plotted in Figure 8. Moreover, the dispersion and intensity of the absorption
curves are found to show considerable variation because of the change
in the explosive functional group at position “1” on
the tetrazole moiety. The theoretical difference in nx, ny, and nz curves
of studied compounds clearly indicate that all the compounds possess
large optical anisotropy. Further, the theoretically calculated (time-independent
DFT) absorption spectra shows considerable blue shift with respect
to the experimental UV–visible spectra of the studied explosives,
which is obvious due to the omission of local field effects and exciton
effects in the present DFT calculations, and these deviations can
be addressed properly by including the excitonic effects through time-dependent
DFT calculations.44

9	1.589	1.635	1.616	0.046(0.019)	1.61	1.81	
The results in Figure 8 and Table 4 also confirm that the calculated average static refractive
index
((n = nx + ny + nz)/3) values of all the compounds are
relatively good in agreement with the experimentally observed values.
Normally, for monoclinic NLO crystals, the refractive indices show
either nx > ny > nz (negative biaxial) or nz > ny > nx (positive biaxial) trend.43 However,
the results from Table 4 show the trend for compound “6”: ny > nz > nx, for compound “7”: nz > nx > ny, for compound
“8”: nz > nx > ny, and for compound “9”: ny > nz > nx. These differences in the actual and obtained refractive indices
can be attributed to the role of excitonic effects,44 which are not accounted in the present study. For preliminary
understanding, the birefringence (Δn) values
of 6, 7, 8, and 9 compounds are calculated by taking the difference
between the maximum value of refractive index to the minimum value
from Table 4. The corresponding
results show the following increment order: Δn (6) > Δn (8) > Δn (7)
> Δn (9). Moreover, these values except
for
that of compound 9 are found to be closer to the well-known nonlinear
crystal DAST (0.39, 0.55, and 0.64)45 and
higher than recently reported carbonate fluoride crystals ABCO3F (A = K, Rb, Cs; B = Ca, Sr, Pb) (Δn around 0.1056, 0.0887, 0.0921, 0.0966) crystal birefringence values,46−49 which clearly indicates that the studied noncentrosymmetric explosive
compounds may possess good phase matching applications in visible
and near-IR regions. Further analyses on frequency-dependent second-harmonic
response of these compounds will be useful in phase transition, sensitivity
correlation studies, and designing new organic nonlinear optical materials
in near future.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
studied the linear and nonlinear optical properties
of newly synthesized tetrazole molecules using time-domain terahertz
spectroscopy, UV–visible–NIR spectroscopy, and DFT.
We have also ascertained the absorption coefficients and refractive
index between 0.1 and 2.2 THz range. In addition, we have performed
single-molecule and single-crystal level DFT calculations. The obtained
structural optimization results confirm the importance of nonbonded
(vdW) interactions. The theoretically calculated zone center vibrational
frequencies at the solid level are found to be good in agreement with
the experimentally observed THz absorption bands. However, the single-molecule
vibrational frequency-based results can be improvised by the incorporation
of intermolecular, interlayer interactions. We have also explained
the optical sensitivity correlations using vibrational frequencies.
The electronic absorption, refractive index, and birefringence studies
reveal the feasibility of phase-matched nonlinear optical frequency
mixing device in the single-crystal form. The study also provides
a good reference for growing organic nonlinear optical materials.
We strongly believe that our present experimental and theoretical
investigations on the studied explosives will open a new channel to
design stable high-energy optical materials which may be used for
different types of defence (detection purposes) and optical device
applications.
