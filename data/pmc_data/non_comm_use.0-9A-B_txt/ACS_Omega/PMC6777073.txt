The
demand for an efficient oil sorbent with high sorption capacity,
low cost, scalable fabrication, and high selectivity for the cleanup
of spreading oil on water is increasingly urgent due to the frequent
occurrence of oil spill accidents in seawater all over the world.
In this study, porous polystyrene (PS) fibers with high hydrophobicity
and superoleophilicity were directly fabricated by a centrifugal spinning
method (CS). The effect of solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and dimethylformamide
(DMF) on the morphology and porous structure of the polystyrene fibers
was evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption–desorption
experiments. The formation mechanism for the porous structure on the
fibers was also evaluated. The oil sorption capacities of the PS fibers
for silicon oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil were investigated. The
highest oil sorption capacity was found in PS fibers fabricated from
PS solution with a THF/DMF weight ratio of 1/3, which exhibited the
highest specific surface area, pore volume, and porosity. The high
productivity and highly porous structure of PS fibers indicate that
CS is a promising method to fabricate porous fibers for the cleanup
of oil spills.

==== Body
Introduction
Oil spill accidents
that occur during the process of oil being
explored, transported, stored, and used have attracted more and more
attention due to the significant and serious damage caused by oil
spills to the ecology of the environment and human well-being.1,2 With an increasing level of attention focused on the preservation
of the environment, researchers have developed a plethora of materials
to concentrate and transform liquid oil to a semisolid or solid phase,
which can then be easily removed from the location of the oil spill.
Recently, many kinds of oil sorbents have been developed, such as
boron-nitride nanosheets,3 carbon-fiber
aerogels,4,5 cellulose-based aerogels,6,7 and
modified melamine sponges.8,9 Among them, organic
synthetic fibers are considered as a promising strategy for oil spillage
removal because of their hydrophobic and oleophilic properties, relatively
low cost, and large scale production. However, the oil sorption capacity
of the majority of conventional fibers is still low, which needs to
be improved for practical application. A novel approach is based on
the use of porous fibers as an oil sorbent. With a high surface area
and high porosity, porous fibers exhibit excellence oil sorption performance
compared with conventional fibers.10,11

Polystyrene
(PS), a common and inexpensive thermoplastic polymer
with low surface energy due to its CH group, has been widely used
to fabricate artificially hydrophobic fibers via electrospinning for
oily water treatment. Wu et al. and Lin et al. fabricated nanoporous
polystyrene fibers using electrospinning for oil sorption.12,13 An electrospun polystyrene nanofiber membrane with superhydrophobicity
and superoleophilicity properties was prepared by Lee et al. for the
separation of an immiscible low viscous oil/water mixture.14 A macroporous fibrous mat with ultrahigh oil
adsorption capability has also been developed by Chen and co-worker.15 While electrospinning is a simple and convenient
technique, the electrospinning technique still suffers from several
limitations, such as low productivity and the requirement of applying
a high electric field.16,17 Centrifugal spinning (CS) (sometimes
called force spinning or rotary jet-spinning) is an emerging nanofiber
fabrication process that overcomes many of the disadvantages associated
with electrospinning.18,19 In this process, polymer jets
are generated and then are elongated to form fibers due to centrifugal
forces regardless of high voltage, enabling the formation of micro/nanofibers
from both conductive and nonconductive polymer solutions. Furthermore,
CS has much higher productivity compared with electrospinning, which
is essential for practical application.20,21

Recently,
CS has been used to produce fibers from various polymers,
such as polycaprolactone (PCL),22 polyacrylonitrile,23 poly(acrylic acid),24 chitin,25 poly(vinylpyrrolidone),26 and polyamide.27 In
the CS process, several processing parameters, e.g., the polymer concentration,
the rotational speed, and solvents will affect the properties of the
final fibers. Among these, the solvents have been shown to have a
direct influence on the morphology and properties of fibers. A finding
reported by Golecki et al. showed that the morphology and diameter
of the polylactic acid (PLA) fibers were greatly influenced by the
evaporation rate of solvents from the polymer solution.28 Obregon et al. reported that the concentration
of dimethylformamide (DMF) in the tetrahydrofuran (THF)/polycaprolactone
(PCL) solution affected the formation of beads and the thermal properties
of PCL fibers.29 Hou et al. demonstrated
that ethyl cellulose/poly(vinylpyrrolidone) fibers with different
porous structures were obtained by control the ethanol/water ratios.30

CS was also used to prepare superhydrophobic
polystyrene/SiO2 composite microfibers.31 However,
the effect of solvent on the morphology and the porosity of PS fibers
was not evaluated. Furthermore, the oil adsorption capacity of centrifugally
spun PS fibers was not studied. In this study, we introduce a scalable
and facile strategy to fabricate hydrophobic and oleophilic PS fibers
by CS. The morphology and porosity of the fibers can be manipulated
by controlling the solvent composition (THF and DMF). The oil sorption
capacity of the obtained fibers was investigated using three different
kinds of oils. The mechanical properties of the as-spun PS fibrous
mats were characterized using a tensile testing system.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Polystyrene pellets (Mw = 252 000 g mol–1) and tetrahydrofuran
were purchased from Wako Co. (Japan). Dimethylformamide was supplied
by Nacalai Tesque Co. (Japan). Silicone oil (ASO-100) was obtained
from As One Co. (Japan). Pump oil (Neovac MR-200) was brought from
Moresco Co. Vegetable oil was purchased from Nisshin OilliO Group,
Ltd. (Japan). Oil cleaning paper was purchased from Kohnan Co. (Japan).
All of the materials listed above were used without further purification.

Preparation of Polymer Solution and the Centrifugal Spinning
Process
To prepare the solutions for the CS process, PS pellets
were dissolved in solvent mixtures of THF and DMF at different weight
ratios (4/0, 3/1, 1/1, 1/3, 0/4), which was followed by mixing for
30 min using a planetary centrifugal mixer (ARE-310, Thinky Co., Japan)
at 2000 rpm and then degassing at 2200 rpm for 1.5 min. The solutions
were kept in a constant-temperature shaker (MMS-1, Eyela Co., Japan)
at 25 °C to obtain homogeneous solutions. The PS solutions were
spun using a CS system of our own design (Figure 1). The CS system was made by modifying a
centrifuge (Tomy MC 150, Tomy Geiko Co., Japan). The CS system consisted
of a 32 mm needle-based spinneret equipped with blunt needles with
an inner diameter of 160 μm and a shaft length of 5 mm, which
was rotated by an AC motor at speeds of 15 000 rpm. The feed
rate for the polymer solution was controlled to be 100 mL h–1 by a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific Inc.). The relative humidity
and temperature were monitored by a hygrothermograph placed inside
the CS chamber and maintained at constant values of 50 ± 5% and
25 ± 2 °C, respectively.

a PS fibrous web produced by CS.

Characterization
The viscosity of each PS solution
and oil used for the oil sorption test was measured by a vibronic
viscometer (SV-1A, A&D Co., Japan) at 25 °C; each sample
was examined at least three times.

The cloud points for the
H2O/(THF/DMF)/PS system were measured at a temperature
of 25 °C. PS solutions with varying concentrations (10, 15, 22,
30 wt %) were prepared by dissolving the polymer in binary solvent
systems using different THF/DMF weight ratios. The as-prepared homogeneous
solution was titrated using deionized water as a nonsolvent. The titration
process was started by adding one droplet of water onto the polymer
solution under stirring and continued by adding more droplets of water
after a clear solution was obtained. The occurrence of the turbid
point was regarded as the onset of the cloud point. The polymer solution
composition and the amount of used water were recorded and plotted
in a ternary phase diagram, which was used to represent the binodal
curves.

The morphology and cross section of the as-spun fibers
were examined
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (JEOL-7600,
JEOL Ltd., Japan). The fibers were collected on the SEM sample base
and then sputter-coated with a 30 nm thick layer of palladium before
being measured with FE-SEM at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. The
diameters of the fibers were obtained from SEM images for 200 fibers
using image processing software (ImageJ).

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms for the PS
fibers were carried out using an automatic surface area and porosimetry
analyzer (TriStar II 3020 Micromeritics; distributed by Shimazu Co.,
Japan). The mass of each sample was approximately 0.3 g. The specific
surface area of the as-spun fibrous mats was calculated using the
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The detailed pore size
distribution and total pore volume for the relevant PS fibrous mats
were obtained from the desorption branch using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method.

The thermal properties of the PS fibers were investigated
using
a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) (TA Q200, TA Instruments
Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with a heating program. The sample was heated
at 10 °C min–1 from −10 to 300 °C
under a nitrogen atmosphere with a gas flow rate of 50 μL·h–1. Each sample was measured at least three times.

The contact angle measurements were conducted using a Phoenix 300
contact-angle system (Kromtek Co., Malaysia) at 20 °C and were
further measured using Image software. Five microliters of deionized
water and silicone oil droplets were dropped onto the surface of the
fibrous mats, respectively. The average water contact angle value
was obtained by measuring at least eight different locations across
the same sample surface.

The mechanical properties of the PS
fibrous mats were investigated
using a universal tensile testing machine (TENSILON RTF–1210,
A&D Co., Japan) (gauge length: 10 mm, crosshead speed: 1 mm s–1, load cell: 100 N). A paper window frame size of
20 × 35 mm2, with a window size of 4 × 25 mm2, was used as a mount for tensile testing. Sections of the
fibrous mat were cut out in the form of miniaturized dog bone-shaped
specimens (type 5B in BS ISO 527: 2012) using a cutting blade. Then,
the specimens were mounted onto the frame and fixed using double-sided
tape. The loading direction for the samples in the testing machine
was parallel to the circumferential fiber collection direction. The
thickness of the testing sample was measured using a micrometer screw
gauge (Mitutoyo 406-250, Mitutoyo, Japan). Tensile tests were performed
in an atmosphere with temperature and humidity of 20 ± 2 °C
and 30 ± 5% RH, respectively. At least five specimens for each
fibrous mat were tested.

The density and porosity of fibrous
membranes were calculated using
the following equations 1   2  where D and P are
the density and porosity of the relevant fibrous membrane, respectively. m, t, and A are the mass,
thickness, and area of the measured membrane, respectively. ρ
is the density of polymer raw material and the density of PS is 1.09
g cm–3.

Oil Sorption Test
The following
procedure was utilized
to determine the maximum oil sorption capacity for the porous fibers:
The PS samples were cut into specimens (2 × 2 cm2)
with an approximate weight of 10 mg. The testing specimen was placed
in a glass beaker filled with 100 mL of oil. After 60 min, the wet
sorbents were removed from the oil container using a nipper and drained
for 10 s. The oil sorption capacities for the PS fibers were calculated
using the following equation 3  where Q (g g–1) is the maximum oil sorption capacity, mw is the total mass of the wet fibers after draining for
10 s, and m0 is the mass of the fibers
before the adsorption
test. The oil adsorption capacity of each sample was measured at least
three times. All of the oil sorption measurements were carried out
at 25 °C. The oil sorption test was set up following published
reports.13,15

Results and Discussion
Morphologies
and Porous Structures of As-Spun Fibers
In the CS process,
the morphology of the fibers is influenced by
several factors, such as solution properties (concentration-viscosity,
the evaporation rate of solvents) and process parameters (rotational
speed, needle size, collector distance). In the first step, the optimum
parameters for the fabrication of PS fibers were studied using PS
solution in THF. A PS solution in THF with a concentration of 16,
18, 20, and 22 wt % was spun at a rotational speed of 15 000
rpm using needles with inner diameters of 160 μm and a collection
distance of 10 cm. The SEM images of the PS fibers prepared from these
relevant solutions are shown in Figure 2. As shown in Figure 2, bead-free fibers were observed at PS concentrations
of up to 22 wt % but beaded fibers were obtained at lower PS concentration.
The appearance of beads on fibrous webs produced from low-concentration
polymer solutions is attributed to the occurrence of Rayleigh instability
during the CS process, which has been studied in previous reports.19,32 The effect of solvents on the porous structure of the PS fibers
was evaluated by changing the weight ratio of THF and DMF using a
polymer concentration of 22 wt %.

Figure 2 FE-SEM images of PS fibers prepared from
PS/THF solutions with
varying PS concentration of (a) 16 wt %, (b) 18 wt %, (c) 20 wt %,
and (d) 22 wt %. CS condition: rotational speed, 15 000 rpm;
needle inner diameter, 160 μm; collection distance, 10 cm.

Figure 3 shows the
FE-SEM images of fibers prepared from 22 wt % PS solutions with varying
THF/DMF weight ratios of 4/0, 3/1, 1/1, 1/3, and 0/4. It can be seen
that the fibers prepared from different solvent mixtures have distinct
interior structures and surface morphologies. A structure with a noncircular
cross section and densely packed porous structure on the surface was
found for the fibers produced from PS/THF solution, as observed in Figure 3a,b.

Figure 3 FE-SEM images of the
PS fibers prepared from 22 wt % PS solutions
with different weight ratios of THF/DMF: (a, b) 4/0, (c, d) 3/1, (e,
f) 1/1, (g, h)1/3, (i, j) 0/4.

With increasing DMF content in the solvent mixtures, significant
differences in terms of morphology and structure of the fibers were
observed. It can be seen that the cross section was circular and that
a porous interior structure was obtained, as shown in Figure 3. When mixture solvents with
a THF/DMF ratio of 3/1 were used, a groove structure was observed
on the surface of the fibers instead of a porous surface (Figure 3c,d). Additionally,
two kinds of surface structures were found for the fiber prepared
with a THF/DMF ratio of 1/1, including wrinkles and a porous surface
with holes inside the fibers (Figure 3e,f). With further increase in the DMF in the solvent
mixture (THF/DMF = 1/3), the fiber became smoother with densely packed
small holes in the surface. Furthermore, a highly porous structure
with large voids near the surface was obtained (Figure 3g,h). When only DMF was used, the structure
of the fibers showed a completely circular cross section and the surface
became smooth. The porous structure inside the fibers also became
more uniform and denser (Figure 3i,j).

Mechanism of Porous Structure Formation on
Fibers
During
the CS process, the evaporation of the solvent from the liquid jet
leads to the rapid solidification of the polymer from the solution.
In addition to the simple drying process, the formation process of
the porous morphologies induced by water vapor condensation can be
divided into three steps, as shown in Figure 4a. At first, the process of solvent evaporation
absorbs heat from the environment, leading to the condensation of
the surrounding water vapor. In the second step, the breath figure
and phase separation processes induce the generation of voids and
the subsequent stretching of the polymer jet under centrifugal forces.
In the final step, solvents further evaporate, leading to the solidification
of fibers with fixed morphology and structure. As illustrated in Figure 4a, the amount of
water determines the surface features of the fibers.

Figure 4 (a) Schematic representation
of the solution jet evolution process
during centrifugal spinning. (b) Phase diagram for the PS solution
with different THF/DMF weight ratios and water at 25 °C.

The formation of surface grooves and inner pores
for the PS fiber
can be attributed to the breath figure and/or phase separation process
that occurs during centrifugal spinning.30,33,34 After condensing from the vapor, the water
droplets immediately permeate into the solution jets and merge with
the solvents. Because water is a nonsolvent for PS, phase separation
can occur depending on the solvent system, called vapor-induced phase
separation (VIPS). This process separates the polymer jet into polymer-rich
regions and water/solvent-rich regions. Consequently, the polymer-rich
regions turn into fiber and water/solvent-rich regions turn into pores.
Combining this phase behavior with the CS process, the formation mechanism
of a porous structure on the nanofiber surface can be attributed to
the breath figure process. While a proportion of these droplets can
penetrate the solution jet to induce a porous structure in the interior,
the remaining droplets on the surface of the jet evaporate and generate
holes on the fiber surface.

The SEM images in Figure 3 confirm the importance of
the breath figure and VIPS in forming
the surface structure and inner pores of the PS fibers. Therefore,
a phase diagram was drawn to depict the phase behavior for the PS
solutions during the CS process. As illustrated in Figure 4b, the ternary diagram is separated
into two zones by binodal curves. The solution jet is homogeneous
upon being extruded from the spinneret (Zone I). With the volatilization
of THF and the subsequent permeation of water into the solution jet,
the proportion of the four components (THF, DMF, water, and PS) in
the jet is dynamically tuned to follow the path shown by the arrows.
After crossing the binodal curve, the solution jet starts to enter
Zone II, where it becomes opaque and separates into a multiphase due
to thermodynamic instability.

As represented in Figure 4b, PS/THF solution requires
the highest amount of water to
enter the phase separation zone. Therefore, phase separation did not
occur when PS/THF was used. Because this polymer solution has the
highest evaporation rate among the used solvent mixtures, the highest
amount of condensed water was found in the surface of its fibers,
leading to the occurrence of the breath figure process, as demonstrated
in Figure 4a. As a
result, there was a dense cross-sectional structure inside the fiber
and a rough surface, as found in Figure 3a,b.

When THF/DMF solvent mixtures
are used, the formation of a grooved
surface and porous interior structure is assigned to both the breath
figure and phase separation process because the composition path easily
crosses into the phase separation zone (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4a, when a THF/DMF weight ratio of 3/1 was
used, the phase separation leads to a bigger hole compared to that
of the PS/THF solution. With further stretching by the centrifugal
force, the hole became the groove. Further, because of the low boiling
point of DMF, fewer droplets were formed at a THF/DMF weight ratio
of 1/3, resulting in small holes at the fiber surface, and large voids
inside the fibers were obtained by the phase separation process. Interestingly,
both a grooved structure and holes inside the fiber were obtained
when the THF/DMF ratio was 1/1. Because of the difference in the evaporation
rate between THF and DMF, the polymer jet was divided into a THF-rich
phase and DMF-rich phase during the spinning process. As a result,
both structures for the grooves and holes were obtained.

Because
DMF evaporates even slower than water, the polymer jet
formed from PS/DMF solution still retained its liquid form and could
be stretched by centrifugal force. Consequently, the holes on the
jet surface and inside the fibers are filled with polymer flow; as
such, smooth fibers with a uniform and dense porous structure were
observed, in accordance with the SEM images in Figure 3i,j.

Fiber Diameter and Porosity
of Fibers
The effect of
solvent composition on the diameter of the fibers was also investigated,
as illustrated in Table 1. The detail fiber diameter distributions can be found in Figure S1. It can be seen that the fibers fabricated
from PS/THF solution (4.46 μm) were larger than the fibers made
from PS/DMF solution (4.21 μm) even though PS/THF solution exhibits
a lower viscosity than that of PS/DMF solution. This finding is due
to the higher vapor pressure of THF, which leads to a higher solidification
rate for the polymer jet, reducing the elongation process for the
polymer jet during the spinning process.28 It should be noted that the fibers produced from mixtures of solvents
exhibited a larger diameter than the fibers prepared from a single
solvent. As reported by Golecki et al., PLA fibers produced from solvent
mixtures having a lower evaporation rate were smaller than those fabricated
from a high evaporation rate solvent mixture.28 However, in this study, the opposite trend was observed when the
solvent composition was changed. This trend would be attributed to
the solvent/nonsolvent exchange that occurs during the spinning process.
The high evaporation rate of THF leads to the formation of a skin
layer, and the solvent/nonsolvent exchange on the polymer jet surface
leads to the higher solidification rate of the polymer jet surface,35,36 preventing the attenuation of the polymer jet and causing an incremental
change in the diameter of the obtained PS fibers.

The effect of solvent on the morphology and structure was further
evaluated by carrying out nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
for the PS fibers fabricated from five different solvent weight ratios,
as represented in Figure 5a. It can be seen from Figure 5a that all samples show type IVa isotherms in the classification
of vapor adsorption isotherms combining proposals from IUPAC,37 which confirms the presence of a porous structure
within the samples. The effect of the solvent on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and pore volume of the as-prepared samples is shown
in Figure 5b. The detailed
BET surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore
volume for the relevant PS fibers are presented in Table 1. The results shown in Figure 5 and Table 1 indicate that the solvent composition
strongly affected the surface area and porosity of the obtained PS
fibers. Overall, the presence of DMF in the mixture leads to a higher
BET surface area and pore volume for the final PS fibers. The PS fibers
prepared from PS/THF solution, which have only a porous structure
on the surface, exhibited the lowest specific surface area and pore
volume, with values of 0.42 m2 g–1 and
0.004 cm3 g–1, respectively. Additionally,
the PS fibers fabricated from PS/DMF solution showed a significantly
higher specific surface area and pore volume, which reached 12.12
m2 g–1 and 0.050 cm3 g–1, respectively. The highest specific surface area
and pore volume, with values of 13.65 m2 g–1 and 0.075 cm3 g–1, respectively, were
found in the fibers prepared from the PS/(THF/DMF = 1/3) solution;
these values are 32.5- and 18.8-fold, respectively, higher than the
same values of the sample made from PS/THF solution.

Figure 5 (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms and (b) BET
surface area and BJH pore volume of the PS fibers fabricated from
22 wt % PS solution with different weight ratios of THF/DMF.

It should be noted that BJH measurement in this
study is applicable
for the voids with a pore size smaller than 300 nm. Therefore, the
BJH results for the PS/(THF/DMF = 3/1) and PS/(THF/DMF = 1/1) samples
showed low values even though they exhibited highly porous structures.
The density and porosity of as-prepared fibrous mats were evaluated
to address the drawback of BJH measurement, as shown in Table 1. The PS/(THF/DMF = 1/3) sample
exhibited the lowest density and the highest porosity, with values
of 101.4 ± 8.0 mg cm–3 and 90.70 ± 0.73%,
respectively. Meanwhile, the PS fibers prepared from PS/THF solution
showed the highest density of 188.9 ± 12.7 mg cm–3 and the lowest porosity of 82.67 ± 1.17%. Furthermore, the
PS fibers prepared from PS/(THF/DMF = 3/1), PS/(THF/DMF = 1/1) and
PS/DMF solutions showed approximately the same density and porosity.
These results corresponded to the obtained SEM images shown in Figure 3. These results also
confirmed that the porous structure formation mechanism was different
when the solvents used were THF and DMF, as discussed above.

Wettability
of As-Prepared Fibrous Mats
The wettability
of as-spun fibrous mats was characterized by using a Phoenix 300 contact-angle
system, as shown in Figure 6. The as-prepared PS fibers exhibited high hydrophobicity
with a water contact angle of over 140°. The high hydrophobicity
of the PS fibrous webs were assigned to their low surface energy caused
by the presence of CH groups in their chemical structure and the micro-nano
hierarchical structures caused by the CS process. As seen in Figure 6, the used solvents
show a small influence on the wettability of the PS fibrous membranes
by changing the surface morphology of the final fibers. The highest
water contact angle of 148.3 ± 2.5° was found in the fibrous
web produced from a solution of PS/(THF/DMF = 3/1), which is attributed
to the high roughness surface caused by the grooves on the surface
of the fibers. Additionally, the fibrous mat prepared from PS/DMF
solution, which shows the smoothest surface structure, has the lowest
water contact angle of 142.3 ± 2.8°. In contrast, when the
silicone oil droplet was placed onto the PS fibrous mats, the oil
droplet immediately spread onto the mats, and the obtained oil contact
angle was 0°, indicating that the PS fibers are superoleophilic
(see Supporting Information Video S1).
Within the superfast oil sorption rate and neglectable water sorption
because of their high hydrophobicity, the PS fibrous mats show that
they are good candidates for application to oil sorption.

% PS solution with varying weight ratios of THF/DMF.

Oil Sorption Capacity
For fibrous sorbents, the adsorbed
oil is mainly distributed over the fiber surface and trapped in the
interconnected void between the fibers; this process is driven by
a capillary force to reduce the surface free energy of the fibers.
With porous structures, the oil adsorption performance can be further
enhanced. The oil sorption test was carried out using three different
kinds of oils: silicon oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil. The detailed
physical properties for these oils can be found in the Supporting
Information Table S1.

Figure 7 shows the maximum oil sorption
capacity of centrifugally spun PS fibrous mats obtained from five
different solvents mixtures and oil cleaning paper. It can be seen
that the fibers prepared from PS solution with a THF/DMF ratio of
1/3 exhibited the highest oil sorption capacity, with oil sorption
rates for silicone oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil of 47.7, 49.8,
and 46.3 g g–1, respectively, which are approximately
5 times higher than the oil sorption capacities of oil cleaning paper
when tested with these oils. Although the PS fibers produced from
PS/(THF/DMF = 1/3) solution are the thickest fibers, the highest porosity
and the large holes inside the fibers located near to the surface
of the fibers provide voids to effectively trap oils, explaining why
this sorbent shows the best oil adsorption capacity. In contrast,
the PS fibers made from PS/THF solution, which have a lowest porosity
with a solid interior structure, show the lowest oil adsorption efficiencies
of 32.2, 34.2 and 29.6 for silicon oil, pump oil and vegetable oil,
respectively, even though these fibers are relatively small with the
fiber diameter of 4.46 ± 2.74 μm. Further, with the same
porosity, the PS/(THF/DMF = 3/1), PS/(THF/DMF = 1/1) and PS/DMF fibrous
mats exhibited approximately the same oil sorption performance.

sorption capacities for the porous fibrous sorbents
of different oils for PS fibers fabricated from 22 wt % PS solution
with different weight ratios of THF/DMF. The reference is oil cleaning
paper.

Taking a detailed look at the
data, the sorption capacity among
four kinds of oils decreases in the following order: pump oil >
silicon
oil > vegetable oil. Similarly, the adsorption performance of the
other samples shows the same trend for the above three kinds of oils.
The different sorption capabilities for these three different kinds
of oils can be attributed to the viscosity of the oil used.12,15 The incremental change in the viscosity of the oil used leads to
better adhesion of highly viscous oils to the fiber surface, which
reduces the desorption rate. As a result, the adsorption capacity
increases for oils with higher viscosity.

The comparison with
other PS fibrous mats reported for oil sorption
in Supporting Information Table S2 indicates
that the oil sorption capacity of centrifugally spun porous PS fibers
is lower than that of porous PS fibers fabricated by the electrospinning
method. This difference is mainly due to the higher fiber diameter
of centrifugally spun fibers, which leads to the formation of a large
interconnected void between the fibers and causes lower oil sorption
performance. However, the production yield of the CS process in this
study is much higher than that of the electrospinning process, reaching
approximately 22 g h–1. The results indicate that
CS is a promising method for the large scale fabrication of PS porous
fibers.

Mechanical Properties and Thermal Properties
In practical
applications, the mechanical properties of porous PS fibrous mats
should be strong enough to stand the weight of oil and the impact
of removal. The tensile strength of the centrifugally spun porous
PS fibrous membrane was tested, and the typical stress–strain
curves are shown in Figure 8a. The maximum tensile stress and the elongation at maximum
tensile stress obtained from the curves are summarized in Figure 8b. When the applied
force increased, the porous PS fibrous mats cracked. The fiber mats
made from PS/THF solution, which have the highest density, demonstrate
the highest tensile strength of 0.52 ± 0.08 MPa and elongation
as maximum stress of 3.7 ± 0.7%. Further, the fibers prepared
from PS/(THF/DMF = 1/3) solution exhibit the lowest mechanical property
values, with a tensile strength of 0.28 ± 0.06 MPa and elongation
at a maximum stress of 6.2 ± 0.6%. This result is due to the
lowest density and highly porous structure of the sample. The tensile
strength of the PS fibers in this study was close to that reported
for electrospun porous and nonporous PS fibrous mats in previously
published studies.38,39 With the tensile strength ranging
from approximately 0.3 MPa to over 0.5 MPa, it is assumed that the
as-spun PS fibers can meet the requirement of mechanical strength
for the application of oil–water separation.39

Figure 8 (a) Stress–strain curves and (b) tensile properties of centrifugally
spun PS fibrous mats fabricated from 22 wt % PS solution with different
weight ratios of THF/DMF.

To investigate the effect of solvent composition on the thermal
properties of the PS fibers, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
was used. The DSC heating scans of the as-spun PS fibers fabricated
prepared from 22 wt % PS solutions with different weight ratios of
THF/DMF are shown in Figure S2. It can
be seen that DSC thermograms of centrifugally spun PS fibers are typical
of those expected for the amorphous PS with the appearance of glass-transition
temperature (Tg) around 90 °C. Therefore,
this study evaluated the effect of solvent composition on the glass-transition
temperature of PS fibers. As shown in Table S3, the Tg of PS fibers was higher than
that of PS bulk, indicating that the centrifugal force could lead
to a higher arrangement of polymer chain inside the fibers. The Tg of PS fibers increased when the solvent mixtures
having higher DMF fraction were used. The low evaporation rate of
DMF caused a lower solidification rate of polymer jet, leading to
further stretching of polymer chains during the centrifugal spinning
process, resulting in the higher Tg of
the final PS fibers.

Conclusions
We have successfully
prepared porous PS fibers with a production
yield of up to 22 g h–1 by directly centrifugally
spinning the PS solution with different THF/DMF weight ratios. The
morphology and interior structure of the fibers can be controlled
by changing the solvent composition. The differences in the morphologies
and porous structures of the PS fibers are due to the occurrence of
a breath figure and vapor-induced phase separation during the CS process.
High sorption capacities of 47.7, 49.8, and 46.3 g g–1 for silicone oil, pump oil, and vegetable oil, respectively, were
found in the PS fibers fabricated from PS solution with a THF/DMF
weight ratio of 1/3. The tensile strength of the PS fibrous membrane
can reach over 0.5 MPa, which can meet the requirement of mechanical
strength for the cleanup of an oil spill event. However, the PS fibers
are still relatively thick, which limits their oil sorption performance.
Therefore, the centrifugal spinning parameters need to be further
studied to reduce the diameter and increase the porous volume of the
PS fibers.
