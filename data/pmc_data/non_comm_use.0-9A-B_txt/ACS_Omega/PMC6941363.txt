Few photosensitizers function in both light and dark
processes
as they usually have no function when the lights are turned off. We
hypothesized that light and dark mechanisms in an α-diketone
will be decoupled by dihedral rotation in a conformation-dependent
binding process. Successful decoupling of these two functions is now
shown. Namely, anti- and syn-skewed
conformations of 4,4′-dimethylbenzil promote photosensitized
alkoxy radical production, whereas the syn conformation
promotes a binding shutoff reaction with trimethyl phosphite. Less
rotation of the diketone is better suited to the photosensitizing
function since phosphite binding arises through the syn conformer of lower stability. The dual function seen here with the
α-diketone is generally not available to sensitizers of limited
conformational flexibility, such as porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and
fullerenes.

Introduction
Dual-functioning compounds, such as those
which perform as both
imaging agents as well as photosensitizers, are an increasing class
of compounds.1−3 Dual functioning has been approached from many different
angles.4,5 In one case, singlet oxygen (1O2) was used to photodegrade micelles for the delivery
of the doxorubicin for combined 1O2 and drug
activity (Figure 1).6 In this case,6 the
photochemical and dark functions relate to a drug release process.

degradation by photogenerated singlet oxygen for the release
of doxorubicin.

However, there is a way to go before photosensitizers
can also
serve simultaneously as chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we describe
an α-diketone sensitization that responds as a conformational
switch to binding, which may bring the goal a step closer. Conformationally
dependent binding of drugs that shut off the photosensitization pathway
are generally not exploited in photodynamic therapy (PDT). The reason
is that conformational twisting is almost never available to sensitizers
as they are often cyclic structures. In the case of porphyrins and
phthalocyanines, a flat shape is largely retained upon excitation.
Sensitizers that can adopt flat and also twisted conformations are
in need of greater study in the context of dual function. Tools from
the perspective of conformational binding can then influence the outcome
of the photooxidation. The two functions (i.e., light and dark) can
come together to influence each other in competitive reactions.

The potential dual-functioning compounds are α-diketones
(diones), which are now explored for chemical binding versus photosensitization
processes. We hypothesized that a dione will act as a sensitizer as
the anti-isomer and act as a chemical binder as the syn-isomer, which amounts to a “give and take”
(Figure 2). That compounds
may be decoupled from sensitization through drug binding would be
of fundamental interest.

Figure 2 Conformational switch of dione for photosensitized
oxidation activity
and binding activity. The dione acts as a photosensitizer (path A)
and binds to a phosphite shutting off the sensitization (path B).
It will be shown how paths A and B are competitive. Dione concentrations
and the proticity of the surrounding environment is tested. Here,
“X” represents a chelating agent such as protein binding
site or a phosphite molecule as is examined in the current work.

Dione compounds have been shown to act well as
binding agents,
including in enzyme active sites.7 For
example, benzils bind to tubulin proteins in a similar manner as stilbenes,
such as combretastatin A-4.8 Furthermore,
diones have been shown to be important in chelation reactions with
phosphites9,10 and have been used in the synthesis of phosphoranes.11,12 Diones such as 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 and monocarbonyl
compounds have been used as photosensitizers in photooxidation reactions13−15 but not in the terms of dione conformational binding and photosensitization
as we describe here. Indeed, the dual functionality of diones for
photosensitization and subsequent binding has not been previously
explored.

We report on a conformational switch between dione-sensitized
peroxide
decomposition and dione binding to phosphite. Tuning the dione conformation
is desired not only to thermally chelate but control peroxide sensitization
to alkoxy radicals in which light path A and dark path B are competitive
(Figure 3). The dione
sensitization is permanently shut off by a conformational switch in
phosphite binding. We now demonstrate that anti-
and syn-skewed conformations of 1 promote
sensitization, whereas the syn conformation promotes
phosphite binding. The following presentation only considers 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 and glyoxal (oxalaldehyde) 2; the former is
in the experimental work, and the latter in the theoretical work.
Dicumyl peroxide [(peroxybis(propane-2,2-diyl))dibenzene] 3 was the peroxide used in these experiments. The mechanism in Figure 3 is consistent with
the data collected, as we will see next.

Figure 3 Proposed mechanism that
blends the dark (thermal) and light (Jablonski-like)
processes. The 1,2-dione sensitizer is competitive in photodecomposition
of dicumyl peroxide 3 (path A) and binding of syn-dione with (MeO)3P (path B). The energetics
for the Jablonski diagram (upper portion) were estimated from literature
data. Aprotic and protic media influence the reaction of the alkoxy
radical. The alkoxy radical also competes with the 1,2-dione for the
(MeO)3P trapping agent. Phosphorane 4 (R = p-CH3C6H4); phosphorane 5 (R = H). “Y” is the C6H5C(Me2) group on dicumyl peroxide 3.

Results
The results are presented in the following
four subsections: (1)
the computed binding process between dione 2 and (MeO)3P; (2) analysis of the kinetics of the binding; (3) sorting
out the contributions from light and dark reactions; and (4) the product
distribution upon photosensitized homolysis dicumyl peroxide 3.

Dihedral Rotation Dependence of Bidentate Binding
Some
details of the dione rotation and phosphite binding can be obtained
from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Dione 2 was used as a model system to mimic the 1,2-dione portion of 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 due to lower computational cost of the former. Dione 2 serves as a model for the DFT calculations but is not a
good sensitizer. Figure 4 shows the B3LYP/D95(d,p) energies for the rotation of dione 2 around the dihedral angle (θ for O=C—C=O),
which was constrained to 10° increments. The anti rotamer is the global minimum, and the syn rotamer
is 5.6 kcal/mol less stable. The syn rotamer is reached
by a syn-skewed transition structure with a barrier
height of 7.5 kcal/mol. For the larger dione (dimethylbenzil, 1), a pure syn geometry of 1 cannot be transposed on its core, and therefore, a syn-skewed minimum is favored due to a buttressing of the nearby aryl
groups, which destabilize the syn geometry. It appears
that the ortho-aryl hydrogens disable dione 1 from adopting a pure syn geometry. Nonetheless, 2 served as a good model for the 1,2-dione segment of 1. Relatedly, Allonas et al.16 describe
the importance of diones in a photochemical reaction. In their reaction,
diones restricted to the syn conformation bore lower ET values by a couple of kcal/mol compared to
diones equilibrating both syn and anti conformations. In our case, a computed rotational profile is featured
for a syn- and anti-dione where
both are stable; however, the less stable syn-dione
reacts with (MeO)3P through an equilibrium process.

Figure 4 DFT computed
energy plot for the 360° rotation of the 1,2-dione
group in 2 and potential energy surface for the reaction
of 2 with (MeO)3P. θ is the dihedral
angle for O=C—C=O of the dione. Oxygen atoms
are red, carbon atoms are gray, and hydrogen atoms are white.

Next, we computed the cyclization path of dione 2 with
(MeO)3P. This binding reaction arises from the syn-dione. The transition structure for the cyclization
is shown in Figure 4, where the resultant dihedral angle (θ is O=C—C=O)
approximately planar for TS2 is 0.9°. The phosphorane 5 possesses a trigonal bipyramidal geometry, where the apical
P–O bond distance (2.37 Å) is longer than the equatorial
P–O bond distance (2.18 Å). The activation energy for
the association of dione 2 with (MeO)3P is
predicted to be ΔE‡ = 15.3
kcal/mol. Only a transition structure for a concerted process from
the syn-dione was found. Transition structures for
a step-wise addition could not be located. We also did not find an
energy minimum for a monodentate binding between dione 2 and (MeO)3P. Formation of phosphorane 5 is
exothermic by 9.1 kcal/mol compared to reagents 1 and 2. The decomposition of phosphorane is a high-barrier process
so that it irreversibly “masks” dione 2, where the energy barrier for the release of phosphite from the
phosphorane is 30.0 kcal/mol. An assessment of molecular orbitals
(MOs) was also informative to understanding the free form of the dione
and the phosphite binding process.

DFT computations show that
the phosphite HOMO is of a σ character
and can donate to the syn-dione 2 LUMO
in a symmetry-allowed process (Figure 5). The HOMO of dione 2 contains π*
orbitals on the C=O bonds, and π bonds are formed in
the P–O groups of the phosphorane 5. The chelation
of (MeO)3P to the dione likely alters the electronic transition
of the dicarbonyl group. The experimental results show that α-diketones
bear a strong n,π* character,16 which is reduced in the phosphorane 5. Next,
we present experimental evidence for a cyclization of dione 1 with (MeO)3P to reach phosphorane 4.

atoms are red, carbon atoms are gray, and hydrogen atoms are white.

Kinetics of Dione Binding to Phosphite
We sought experimental
evidence for the formation of phosphorane 4 since dione 1 is a sensitizer. Figure 6 shows the reaction of dione 1 with (MeO)3P over time. Figure S8 (Supporting
Information) shows that a near-linear pseudo-first order fits for
their disappearance. Due to the sparing stability of phosphorane 4, kinetics for its disappearance do not fit first order kinetics.
Phosphorane 4 is an intermediate and exists for ∼10
min as a mixture in the reaction. Notice that the absorptivity of
dione 1 decreases when chelated to (MeO)3P
upon formation of the phosphorane 4 (Figure S7). A weak phosphorane absorption is attributed to
a π,π* transition that appears at a shorter wavelength
(λmax = 235 nm) in comparison to dione 1 (λmax = 270 nm), although the phosphorane still
bears an n,π* transition. The transient phosphorane 4 was detected by 1H NMR (doublet “b”
is located at 3.66 and 3.69 ppm) (Figure S2), where its location is similar to POCH3 peaks in phosphorane
compounds previously reported.11 The 31P NMR data also show evidence for the phosphorane 4 (−49.6 ppm) (Figure S4) in which
the phosphorus atom is covalently bound to five oxygen atoms. Similar
negative chemical shifts have been observed for other phosphoranes.12

Figure 6 Plot of the disappearance of 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 (solid circle) and (MeO)3P (box solid) and appearance
of phosphorane 4 (triangle up solid) over time in CH3CN.

The appearance of trimethylphosphate [(MeO)3P=O]
is a consequence of the phosphorane 4 decomposition via
aryl migration, a side reaction leading to ketene. Based on the literature
of ketenes,11 cleavage of phosphorane 4 is expected to lead to (p-MeC6H4)2C=C=O, (MeO)3P=O,
and by-products, although we did not analyze these downstream reactions.
Next, we sought to examine the competitive binding of dione 1 with (MeO)3P (dark path B) and the photooxidation
activity in cumyloxy radicals generated in dicumyl peroxide 3 photodecomposition (light path A).

Separating the Light and Dark Paths
In addition to
phosphite chelation to dione (path B), we show that phosphite can
be used to indirectly monitor the photodecomposition of dicumyl peroxide
by trapping the resultant cumyloxy radicals (light path A) (Table 1). The use of phosphite
as alkoxy radical traps is reported in the literature.17,18Table 1 shows that
the dione 1 sensitized dicumyl peroxide 3 decomposition as a function of the sensitizer to peroxide ratios.
The ratios correspond to concentrations of 100 mM 1 and
0.5 to 100 mM 3. Data are shown for (MeO)3P=O formed from light path A, dark path B, and combined paths
A + B. Samples were irradiated in N2-sparged solutions
with 300 < λ < 700 nm light from 400 W metal halide lamps
with a fluence of 21.8 mW/cm2. Table 1 (column 5) shows the data for tracking the
loss of dicumyl peroxide 3 in the photoreaction. The
sensitizer/peroxide ratio of 1:1 showed a 9% increase in peroxide
homolysis compared to the 1:10 ratio (entries 1 and 2). Thus, the
photosensitized decomposition of 3 was about 3 times
more rapid in the 1:1 ratio sensitizer/peroxide compared to the 1:10
ratio. As we see, the sensitized decomposition of 3 was
shown to require a high sensitizer to peroxide ratio. Ratios of 1:40
or lower (entries 3–5) show no detectable sensitized decomposition
of dicumyl peroxide 3. The amount of phosphate formed
under light (column 5) and dark (column 6) reactions can be readily
determined. In the dark, the reaction of dione 1 and
(MeO)3P led to phosphorane 4 and by-products
based on UV–vis and NMR data. After 41 min, the reaction mixture
contained dione 1 and phosphorane 4 in a
ratio of ∼1:1 (Figure S7, Supporting
Information). Entry 7 is a control experiment showing that no detectable
amount of phosphate is formed over a 1 h period in the dark and in
the absence of dicumyl peroxide and dione 1.

Path B clearly is significant since path A values
are lower by
comparison. In the absence of sensitizer, direct irradiation (300
< λ < 700 nm) leads to no detectable photodecomposition
of dicumyl peroxide 3 (entry 6). Indeed, the poor excitation
wavelength overlap of the dicumyl peroxide 3 with the
light source provides an explanation for dicumyl peroxide’s
stability without a sensitizer. While dicumyl peroxide 3 is photochemically unstable with UVC light (data not shown), our
light source is mainly UVA and visible light with some UVB, and thus,
we demonstrate that dione sensitizer 1 leads to the photolability
of dicumyl peroxide 3. The extent of peroxide decomposition
due to direct irradiation (280 < λ < 700 nm) is negligible
for dicumyl peroxide 3 (∼0%) under our conditions.
Thus, it follows that the fragility of peroxide O–O bonds needs
to be negligible for quantitation of any sensitized contribution to
the decomposition. Next, we carried out DFT studies to probe the dicumyl
peroxide O–O bond dissociation further.

Since the dicumyl
peroxide 3 is not excited, we conducted
ground-state DFT calculations rather than time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-DFT) calculations to predict the energetics for O–O
bond dissociation on the singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces
(PESs). The O–O bond was elongated and optimized at each distance
with the resulting potential energy curves shown in Figure 7. It is readily seen that on
the singlet surface, O–O bond separation is endothermic with
a barrier to O–O bond homolysis of ∼60 kcal/mol. In
contrast on the triplet surface, the O–O bond separation is
exothermic and the forming cumyloxy radical pairs are strongly repulsive.
The singlet surface in Figure 7A shows that the separated cumyloxy radicals are found oriented
in an anti conformation. On the singlet surface,
the homolysis would be high in energy, unveiling alkoxy radicals.
On the other hand, the triplet surface in Figure 7B shows that the separated cumyloxy radicals
remain in a cis-skewed conformation even up to a
separation distance of 3.5 Å. Based on these DFT results (Figure 7) and keeping in
mind that the O–O bond dissociation energy (BDE) of dicumyl
peroxide 3 is 36 kcal/mol,19,20 we surmise
that the photosensitized O–O bond homolysis occurs on the triplet
manifold via energy transfer to a repulsive orbital of the O–O
bond. For releasing the cumyloxy radicals beyond their contact pair
as free species, a small amount of heat would then be required.

surface and (B) triplet surface. The structures were optimized with
the O–O bond being constrained by increases in 0.05 Å
increments. Relative energies in kcal/mol.

Trapping of Photogenerated Cumyloxy Radical
As dicumyl
peroxide 3 can be photosensitized to homolytically cleave,
we turned to an evaluation of the effect of reaction medium on the
product distribution to seek further evidence of the existence of
cumyloxy radical. Table 2 shows data that determine the effect of the surrounding media on
the products formed in the 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 sensitized decomposition of dicumyl peroxide 3. Here,
acetophenone (6), 2-phenylpropan-2-ol (7), and α-methylstyrene (8) were detected as products.
These products have higher triple state energies (ET) than 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 and
are not expected to serve as sensitizers; however, their distribution
depended on the presence or absence of a H-atom source.

In wet acetonitrile-d3, irradiating
with light from 300 < λ < 700 nm, the products formed
were acetophenone 6 (2%) and 2-phenylpropan-2-ol (7) (98%) (Table 2, entry 1). Somewhat similarly, according to the literature, a plasmon
excitation reaction in methanol showed dicumyl peroxide 3 decomposition to 6 (50%) and 7 (50%) (entry
2).19 In contrast, in dry acetonitrile-d3, products were favored in the opposite direction
with the near exclusive formation of acetophenone 6 (99%),
with 2-phenylpropan-2-ol 7 (<1%) and a trace amount
of α-methylstyrene 8 (entry 3). Solution-free conditions
on silica with unfiltered UV light (280 < λ < 700 nm)
or with direct irradiation of 3 with 254 nm light in
a container rotated by a stirring paddle to tumble the particles were
used. The solution-free conditions led to a slightly reduced yield
of acetophenone 6 (67–70%), with 2-phenylpropan-2-ol 7 (4–5%) and α-methylstyrene 8 (1–2%)
(entries 4 and 5). For the solution-free reactions on silica, the
mass balance of the reaction was ∼75% due to evolution of volatile
species, such as CH3· and CH4. According
to the literature, the plasmon-mediated reaction in acetonitrile also
showed the main product to be 6 (98%) with a minor amount
of 7 (2%) (entry 6).19

We attribute these results to cumyloxy radicals formed in the sensitized
homolysis of dicumyl peroxide 3, which abstracts H-atoms
from water (in wet acetonitrile) or silanol (SiOH) groups on the silica
surface. The cumyloxy radical may also be reacting with water adsorbed
to the silica surface, leading to increased percent yields of 7. The heterogeneous experiment was carried out on silica
with high relative amounts of SiOH groups for H-atom abstraction.
Our results are consistent with literature reports of H-atom abstraction
by cumyloxy radicals in polymer cross-linking and other reactions.21,22

Discussion
We show that an equilibrium process of the
less stable syn conformer of a dione binds to (MeO)3P irreversibly. The facility of this increases with the syn-dione conformation. Since diones have been used as protein
binding drugs,7,8 there is a potential for their
use in rotation tuning for binding from the syn form
to sensitization from the anti form. That is, the
function of the dione would be more photodestructive in the anti form but more effective in protein binding, for example,
in the syn form. The competition for chemical selectivity
(modulation response) emerges through an equilibrium process involving
the less stable syn conformer. The transition state
and formation of phosphorane arise from the syn-dione
according to the DFT calculations.

The photosensitized decomposition
of dicumyl peroxide 3 requires relatively high concentrations
of dione 1 and is proposed to take place on the triplet
manifold. Cumyloxy radicals are formed and scavenge H-atoms from surface
silanols, water adhered to silica, methanol, and water producing cumyl
alcohol as the major product. In the peroxide-sensitized homolysis,
H-atom abstraction of protic media by the cumyloxy radical is an important
process that competes with methyl radical loss and formation of acetophenone
as a major product in the dicumyl peroxide photodecomposition reaction.
Dione 1 is not likely to photoreduce in the presence
of water but would be susceptible to photoreduction with H-atom donors
such as triethylamine or a phenol substituted with an electron-donating
substituent.16 In terms of product formation,
produced acetophenone (ET = 74 kcal/mol)
may also serve as a photosensitizer, although 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 has a fairly low-lying triple state (ET = ∼51 kcal/mol) is expected to be the main photosensitizer
over the course of the peroxide 3 homolysis reaction.
Also, for comparison, O2 degassed conditions were used;
otherwise, a competing process would include dione sensitization to
O2 and formation of singlet oxygen. Our work is also part
of a growing body of work,17,27−33 examining sensitization reactions by peroxide O–O bond homolysis,
where the reaction is also relevant to the more commonly studied sensitization
of 3O2 to 1O2.

Conclusions
We present a new concept for dark conformational
dependence in
connection with attenuating a photooxidation reaction. Namely, the
ability of an α-diketone (4,4′-dimethylbenzil) to act
as a photosensitizer for alkoxy radical production and to bind to
a trialkyl phosphite was studied in homogenous and heterogeneous systems.
Upon binding to phosphite, the 4,4′-dimethylbenzil decreased
in its alkoxy radical photoproduction, acting as a shutoff mechanism.
This opens the avenue of α-diketones for prospective dual action
in sensitization and in drug binding activity.

Diones such as 1 can serve as photosensitizers but
also have dark binding opportunities. The light and dark paths are
competitive paths due to the rotational dependence about the two carbonyl
groups, with the syn enhancing dark binding and the anti- or syn-skewed increasing the light-dependent
route. The system is a step toward the dual-action goal in which the
design can be tailored to a selected binding site to enhance the cooperative
dialog between phototherapy and drug binding. Such a collective mode
of reaction is generally not available to sensitizer macrocycles with
restricted conformational freedom.

Porphyrins have been studied
and act well as 1O2 sensitizers but usually
bind to membranes rather than within
enzymatic pockets.23 Porphyrin distortion
away from planarity can lead to a shutoff of their sensitizer activity;24−26 however, porphyrins’ large size mostly disallow competing
processes, such as binding in a protein pocket. Here, we report on
a dione that can bind a phosphite, an observation similar to the dione
binding at metal active sites in enzymes (e.g., tropolones and hydroxytropolones),
where the relative size of dione 1 and derivatives can
facilitate binding. The effectiveness of the dione as a photosensitizer
is suggested but only prior to binding, which suggests a potential
advantage to dione-sensitized reactions in PDT applications.

Experimental Section
Computations
Calculations were carried out using Gaussian
09 (revision D.01)36 with the B3LYP functional
and the D95(d,p) basis set in the gas phase. Molecules were visualized
with GaussView 5.0.37 The transition state
structure TS2 was verified as transition states by frequency
calculations. Calculations were also carried out by scanning of bond
rotations for dione 2 and the O–O bond dissociations
of dicumyl peroxide 3 in the singlet and triplet surfaces
by constraining compound geometries.

General
Reagents used including 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1, dicumyl peroxide 3, trimethylphosphite [(MeO)3P], trimethylphosphate [(MeO)3P=O], and
triisopropyl phosphate [(n-C3H7O)3P=O] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
as received. Potassium hydrogen phthalate from Fisher Scientific was
used as received. Acetonitrile, acetonitrile-d3, dichloromethane, and methanol were purchased from VWR and
used as received. The hydrophilic fumed silica particles used were
200–300 nm in diameter, with 200 ± 25 m2/g
surface area.

Photolysis Method
Figure S1 shows a schematic of irradiation that was conducted with samples
placed in a 1 cm filter solution of 0.5% w/v potassium hydrogen phthalate
in water to collect light from 300 < λ < 700 nm at the
midpoint between two 400 W metal halide lamps, which delivered light
(280 < λ < 700 nm). A handheld UV 254 nm light source
was also used. Rises in temperature of ∼2–3 °C
were observed for the sample solution under irradiation after 1 h.
We have previously measured the fluency rate at a midpoint in between
the bulbs to be 21.8 ± 2.4 mW/cm2.34 The tail of the absorption of dione 1 (280–310
nm) overlaps with the output of the metal halide light, but this overlap
is poor and nearly nonexistent with dicumyl peroxide 3, phosphorane 4, (MeO)3P, and (MeO)3P=O. The compound, (n-C3H7O)3P=O, was used as an internal standard.
Photolyses of dione 1 and dicumyl peroxide 3 were done in N2-sparged solutions and heterogeneous samples,
as described next.

Homogeneous Method
Typically, acetonitrile solutions
were used containing dicumyl peroxide 1 (0.1 M) in the
presence or absence of sensitizer 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 (0.01 M) and (MeO)3P (0.1 M). The solutions were
sparged with N2 for 15 min prior to irradiation where the
headspace was filled with N2. Oxygen-free conditions were
needed; otherwise, the sensitizer 1 produces singlet
oxygen under aerobic conditions.15 Phosphorous
trapping agents such as trimethyl phosphite have been reported to
trap the alkoxy radicals35 and thus were
used here. The product (MeO)3P=O was monitored by
GC/MS and 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopies. The
peroxide decomposition yields did not vary by more than 1% between
the two methods: GC/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. The use
of 31P NMR spectroscopy produced higher error (∼2–3%).
GC/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy were also used to characterize
the hydrocarbon products.

Heterogeneous Method
The preparation of 4,4′-dimethylbenzil 1 and dicumyl peroxide 3 coadsorbed onto fumed
silica has been described previously.17 Briefly, fumed silica was immersed in a dichloromethane solution
of solvated 1 and 3. After stirring, the
dichloromethane was evaporated with a stream of N2 gas,
leaving reagents adsorbed on the silica. The silica particles were
further dried under vacuum. Compound adsorption was assumed to be
uniform. We used a 20 cm3 glass container containing 100
mg of silica particles adsorbed with 1 and 3 that form a two-phase system that was N2-degassed. This
container was rotated by its attachment to a stirring paddle where
the silica particles tumbled during irradiation for 1 h. Once the
photolysis was completed after 1 h, products 6–8 were detected upon desorption from the silica surface with
dichloromethane or methanol and filtered with a syringe-loaded filter.
Here, we monitored the consumption of dicumyl peroxide 3 over time and quantitated the products formed based on GC/MS and
NMR. The possible formation of volatile products was not explored.
