High
performance, low cost, and low toxicity have been the main
characteristics associated with magnesium-based thermoelectric materials.
Nevertheless, the high volatility of magnesium creates challenges
in the synthesis of these materials. In this work, n-type Mg2Ge is synthesized using a solid-state technique, fully characterized,
and compared with Mg2Ge fabricated through different processes.
We have found that Bi is an ineffective dopant in Mg2Ge
and precipitates into Mg2Bi3. Regardless of
the technique used, the loss of Mg by evaporation and formation of
precipitates in Bi-doped samples resulted in a low charge carrier
concentration and, consequently, a low power factor. The precipitates
significantly reduced the lattice thermal conductivity, however, leading
to a figure-of-merit, zT, of 0.4 at 725 K, improving
the previously reported figure-of-merit, zT, of 0.2
for Sb-doped Mg2Ge. This work highlights the impact of
the fabrication technique on the thermoelectric performance of Mg-based
compounds.

Introduction
Magnesium-based thermoelectric
materials have garnered considerable
attention because of their promising performance, low cost, and environmental
friendliness.1,2 Mg2X (X = Si, Ge, and
Sn) compounds crystallize in the Fm3m space group, and they exhibit similar electronic band structures
and a split conduction band. Recent studies have focused on the thermoelectric
performance of n-type ternary3−5 and quaternary4,6,7 alloys of Mg2Si, Mg2Ge, and Mg2Sn in various ratios to improve their conversion
efficiency, defined by the figure-of-merit, zT = S2T/ρκtot, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, T is the absolute temperature, ρ is the electrical resistivity,
and κtot is the total thermal conductivity, through
the convergence of conduction bands8,9 and increased
mass-difference phonon scattering.10−12 The binary compounds
have received limited attention, however, because of their relatively
low performances, especially Mg2Ge, with three reports
on n-type bulk samples10,13,14 and only one report on the thin film p-type Mg2Ge.15 It is of great interest to understand the transport
properties of these binary compounds and their interactions with the
most common dopants to correctly design alloys with higher thermoelectric
performance.

The fabrication of Mg-based semiconductors encounters
intrinsic
challenges because of the low vapor pressure and high reactivity of
magnesium with potential crucibles. A large number of fabrication
methods have been employed to synthesize Mg-based thermoelectric materials,
including low-temperature ball milling,8,16 solid-state
reaction,12,17 one-step sintering by spark plasma sintering
(SPS) using MgH2 as a precursor for Mg,14,18 melting and casting using crucibles made of tantalum,19 alumina sealed with B2O3,20 boron nitride,7 graphite,12 and molybdenum foil21 to avoid the reaction of magnesium with quartz,
where these are sealed under vacuum. Here, we have synthesized n-type
Mg2Ge bulk samples by doping with Bi and Sb through the
solid-state reaction. The transport properties of these samples are
compared with those of previous studies,10,13 including our recent report on n-type Mg2Ge samples,
fabricated via one-step SPS of elemental Ge and Bi/Sb with MgH2.14 A maximum zT of ∼0.4 at 725 K is achieved for Mg2Ge0.98Bi0.02, an improvement over the zT of
0.2 for the Sb-doped Mg2Ge13 because of a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity, while
obtaining a similar power factor (PF). Our work underscores the impact
that different synthesis techniques have on the properties of Mg-based
thermoelectrics and the difficulty in comparing these materials when
they are synthesized by different methods.

Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sintered Mg2Ge1–xBix (x = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03) and Mg2Ge1–ySby (y = 0.02) samples (Figure 1) can be indexed to the cubic CaF2 structure (Fm3m space group) of
Mg2Ge. Small amounts of the secondary phase Mg2Bi3 were detected in the Bi-doped samples with x = 0.02 and 0.03. The inset of Figure 1 shows the increase in the lattice parameter
of Mg2Ge with the increasing dopant concentration, as larger
atoms of Bi and Sb substitute Ge atoms.22 The difference between the lattice parameters of the samples with
a Bi content of x = 0.02 and 0.03 is insignificant,
which is consistent with the detection of Mg2Bi3 in these samples, suggesting that Bi added beyond 0.67 at. % has
formed precipitates. The observed solubility of Bi in Mg2Ge obtained in the current study using a solid-state synthesis technique
is significantly higher than 0.17 at. % in our previous report, based
on the one-step SPS synthesis of Mg2Ge.14 The latter method comprises a single step at a lower temperature
that relies on the rapid reaction of Ge and MgH2 upon hydrogen
liberation, with an extremely short time for homogenization. The reaction
of Mg with Bi also appears to have been preferred in the one-step
SPS synthesis, reducing the amount of Bi available for doping. As
the Mg2Bi3 precipitates were already formed,
the subsequent annealing step had no effect beyond stabilization of
the structure. In this work, the mixture was reacted in two stages
at a higher temperature for a prolonged time, with grinding and homogenization
of the powder in the interval between the stages, allowing for better
dissolution of Bi in Mg2Ge. Mg2Bi3 precipitates still formed, however, albeit only at higher concentrations
of Bi.

of the dopant type and content, as obtained by Rietveld refinement.
Trace amounts of Mg2Bi3 were detected in the
Bi-doped samples with x = 0.02 and 0.03.

The backscattered electron microscopy (BSE) images
of both Bi-
and Sb-doped samples at the same dopant concentration of x = 0.02 and y = 0.02 (0.67 at. %) confirmed the
presence of precipitates with high atomic number at grain boundaries
(particle size < 1 μm), which are indicated by arrows in Figure 2a, for the Bi-doped
sample. The energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Figure 2c,d) reveals that
these precipitates are rich in Bi, confirming the presence of the
Mg2Bi3 phase detected by XRD. We have also detected
that these precipitates in the Bi-doped samples are synthesized by
a one-step SPS process.14 The Sb-doped
sample is free of precipitates (Figure 2b).

Temperature-dependent Seebeck
coefficient (S),
electrical resistivity (ρ), and PF, where PF = S2/ρ, for Mg2Ge1–xBix (x = 0.01,
0.02, and 0.03) and Mg2Ge1–ySby (y = 0.02)
samples are shown in Figure 3. All samples show a linear dependence of the Seebeck coefficient
with a temperature of up to ∼650 K, where it reaches a plateau
(Figure 3a). Bi doping
reduces the absolute S from ∼210 μV/K
for x = 0.01 to −190 μV/K for x = 0.02, after which it remains roughly constant, showing
that further addition of Bi leads to an insignificant increase in
the charge carrier concentration (Table 1), n, on which the position
of the Fermi level and consequently the Seebeck coefficient are dependent.
This result is consistent with the observation of Bi-rich precipitates
formed at grain boundaries in the x = 0.02 sample.
The Sb-doped sample exhibits a lower absolute S compared
to the similarly Bi-doped samples, x = 0.02 and 0.03.
The measured charge carrier concentrations of these samples are very
similar (Table 1),
indicating a comparable position of the Fermi level in relation to
the bottom of the conduction band. According to eq 1 1  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, e is the electron charge, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, m* is the density of states effective mass, and r is the scattering parameter.23 Note that
the Seebeck coefficient is proportional to . The carrier concentration values of samples
doped with Bi and Sb are similar. Therefore, the difference in the
Seebeck coefficient must arise from the differences in the effective
mass, suggesting that Sb and Bi have different effects on the electronic
band structure, as the scattering mechanism is unlikely to change
between the dopants.

a The final Mg deficiency, z, in Mg2–zGe1–xBix (x = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03) and Mg2–zGe1–ySby (y = 0.02) was estimated based on the measured
carrier concentration.

The
electrical resistivity of the samples initially decreases with
temperature, showing the typical behavior of intrinsic semiconductors,
and exhibits metallic behavior at higher temperatures (Figure 3b). The magnitude and temperature
of this behavioral change decrease with the dopant concentration,
as the thermal energy needed to promote carriers to the conduction
band decreases with the charge carrier concentration.24 This effect is only visible because of the relatively low
charge carrier concentrations in the current study, even at x = 0.03, as displayed in Figure 4, where a rapid decrease in the Hall coefficient
(RH) above ∼200 K indicates the
thermal excitation of electrons to the conduction band. The room-temperature
Hall carrier mobility (Table 1), μH, has increased slightly by the addition
of Bi. This is due to very low charge carrier concentrations of lightly
doped samples, which show the behavior of transport properties of
the nondegenerate semiconductor.

The stoichiometry of Mg is known to have a significant
effect on
the electrical characteristics of Mg-based thermoelectric materials.25 Each excess Mg atom occupies interstitial sites,
contributing two electrons to the conduction band,25 whereas each Mg atom vacancy acts either as a double hole
donor26,27 or as an electron trap localized within
the band gap.28 Regardless of the principle
regulating Mg vacancies, Mg deficiency severely decreases the carrier
concentration of n-type samples. This explains the much lower electron
carrier concentration obtained in the current study, n ≈ 1018 cm–3, compared to the
similarly Sb-doped Mg2Ge,13 which
resulted in a room-temperature electrical resistivity of 0.195 mΩ·cm
and a carrier concentration of 5.8 × 1020 cm–3 for Mg2.2Ge0.99Sb0.01 with excess
Mg. The deficiency of Mg (z) in Mg2–zGe1–xBix and Mg2–zGe1–ySby was
estimated using , where V is the
unit cell
volume, n is the carrier concentration, and x is the dopant stoichiometry, and the results are displayed
in Table 1. This equation
estimates the Mg deficiency by considering Bi atoms and Mg vacancies
as the only sources of charge carriers/vacancies in the system, that
is, assuming that there are no Mg2Bi3 precipitates.

The bipolar effect is observed at temperatures above ∼650
K in the Seebeck coefficient plot (Figure 3a), similar to our previous study.14 This effect is not visible on the thermal conductivity
plot as a function of temperature (Figure 5a) because of the negligible bipolar component
of the thermal conductivity29 (κb) (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Temperature dependence of the (a) total thermal conductivity (with
the sum of the lattice and bipolar components as an inset) and (b)
figure-of-merit, zT, of Mg2Ge1–xBix and Mg2Ge1–ySby.

The total (κtot) and lattice (κlat) thermal conductivities of the
samples are shown in Figure 5a. The Wiedemann–Franz
relation, κe = L0T/ρ, is used to calculate the electronic thermal conductivity,
where L0 is the Lorenz number and ρ
is the electrical resistivity. The Lorenz number used in the calculation
of κe is the theoretical limit for degenerate semiconductors
2.45 × 10–8 V2 K–2.30 The lattice and bipolar thermal conductivities
of all samples are calculated by deducting the electronic contribution
to the total thermal conductivity using κtot = κlat + κe + κb (Figure 5a inset). The lattice thermal
conductivity dominates κtot in all samples, and it
decreases with the temperature and Bi dopant concentration. Even though
the charge carrier density increased slightly with the added dopant,
the electronic component of the thermal conductivity is too small
to significantly contribute to the total thermal conductivity.

The total thermal conductivity of the samples produced in the current
study is much lower than that in the previous report on heavily doped
n-Mg2Ge13 (Figure 6a). Figure 6b shows that the lattice thermal conductivity
in the previous report is similar to that of the Sb-doped sample in
the current study, which is evidence of the significantly lower contribution
of the electronic thermal conductivity, originating from the low carrier
concentration of our samples. The lattice thermal conductivity of
the Bi-doped samples is lower than that of the Sb-doped one owing
to the increased phonon scattering by Mg2Bi3 precipitates and point defects. Moreover, the effect of the precipitates
is visible in the significant decrease in the lattice thermal conductivity
with the increased Bi concentration. The formation of Mg2Bi3 leads to further depression of the electron concentration
by reducing the amount of available Bi, which acts as an electron
donor in Mg2Ge, and by leading to the additional loss of
Mg from the matrix. Furthermore, the low charge carrier concentration
of the samples produced in this work makes κe practically
negligible, representing only ∼4% of κtot,
whereas in highly doped Mg2Ge,13 it accounts for ∼50%. Despite the significantly higher electrical
resistivity obtained in the previous report14 and in this work, when compared to the heavily Sb-doped Mg2Ge,13 our samples exhibit a similar PF
(Figure 6c). The final zT of our samples is therefore higher, owing to the reduced
thermal conductivity (Figure 6d). These results suggest that studying the interaction of
Bi with high zT Mg-based thermoelectrics alloyed
with Ge might be of interest to improve our understanding of their
high performance and perhaps guide further improvements. To take advantage
of the impact of precipitates on the thermal conductivity while maintaining
low electronic resistivity, we suggest a double-doping approach with
Sb and Bi.

Conclusions
n-type Mg2Ge bulk samples doped with Bi or Sb were synthesized
via a solid-state reaction and compared with previous reports on n-type
Mg2Ge fabricated by different processes. Despite the attempt
to compensate for the Mg loss in the current study, all samples exhibited
deficiency of magnesium, heavily depressing the charge carrier concentration.
Furthermore, Bi reacted with Mg to form Mg2Bi3 precipitates, leading to further Mg loss and reduced doping of Mg2Ge by Bi. This led to a high electrical resistivity, a high
Seebeck coefficient, and a low lattice thermal conductivity, whereas
the electronic thermal conductivity was negligible. This resulted
in a maximum zT of ∼0.4 at 725 K for Mg2Ge0.98Bi0.02. These results highlight
the impact of the fabrication technique on the magnesium stoichiometry
in Mg-based thermoelectric compounds and indicate that Bi is an unsuitable
dopant for Mg2Ge.

Materials and Methods
Magnesium
turnings (Mg, Alfa Aesar, 99.98%), germanium powder (Ge,
Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), bismuth powder (Bi, Alfa Aesar, 99.999%), and
antimony shots (Sb, Alfa Aesar, 99.999%) were used to synthesize Mg2Ge1–xBix (x = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03) and Mg2Ge1–ySby (y = 0.02). Stoichiometric mixtures of elements
were sealed in a boron nitride-coated vacuum-sealed quartz ampoule,
with 50 wt % extra Mg to compensate for losses during the synthesis
processes. The required amount of extra magnesium was optimized to
obtain a single-phase compound, that is, free of unreacted Ge, as
determined by the XRD analysis. This approach was necessary to directly
compare the impact of different synthesis techniques on the characteristics
of Mg2Ge samples with added Bi and Sb. The mixtures were
reacted at 1123 K for 30 min and annealed at 673 K for 10 h. The product
was hand-ground to a fine powder in an agate mortar and pestle, and
the resulting powders were sintered in a 12 mm graphite die using
SPS at 1073 K and an axial pressure of 50 MPa for 1 h under vacuum.
All material and powder handling and preparation were performed in
a glovebox under a positive-pressure argon atmosphere.

The crystal
structure and phase characterization were obtained
with a MAC Science X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.544 Å, 40 kV, 25 mA). The obtained powder XRD patterns
were fitted using Rietveld refinement to estimate the lattice parameters
of the synthesized samples. The microstructure and phase composition
of the Mg2Ge1–xBix and Mg2Ge1–yBiy samples were analyzed
by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL 7001F SEM) instrument,
with the SEM equipped with EDS. The thermal diffusivity (D) was obtained using the laser flash method with a Linseis LFA 1000
instrument and used to calculate the thermal conductivity (κ),
from κ = d·D·Cp. The density (d) was measured
using dimensions and weight of the sample, whereas the heat capacity
(Cp) was obtained from the literature.8,31,32 The Seebeck coefficient (S) and the electrical conductivity (σ) were obtained
using the slope method in a quasi-steady-state mode of a Linseis LSR-3
instrument, with temperature differences between the probes of 2–10
K in the parallelepiped-shaped samples. Hall effect measurements were
performed using a Physical Property Measurement System from Quantum
Design from 5 to 400 K.
