A novel strategy is described to prepare magnetic Pd nanocatalyst
by conjugating lignin with Fe3O4 nanoparticles
via activation of calcium lignosulfonate, followed by combination
with Fe3O4 nanoparticles. Tethering 5-amino-1H-tetrazole to calcium lignosulfonate-magnetite hybrid through
3-chloropropyl triethoxysilane enabled coordination of Pd salt with
Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@5-amino-1H-tetrazole. The underlying changes of the lignosulfonate are identified,
and the structural morphology of attained Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@5-amino-1H-tetrazole-Pd(II) (FLA-Pd)
is characterized by Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetry differential
thermal analysis, energy-dispersive spectrometry, field-emission scanning
electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and vibrating
sample magnetometer (VSM). The synthesized FLA-Pd displayed high activity
for phosphine-free C(sp2)–C(sp2) coupling
in water, and the catalyst could be reused for seven successive cycles.

Introduction
Lignin is an amorphous polymer
that comprise three main monomer blocks, namely coniferyl, p-coumaryl, and sinapyl alcohol1,2 and
is the second most plentiful biomass on the planet earth after cellulose.
One of the most important sources of commercial lignin is the byproduct
from biorefineries and pulp industries,3,4 and its conversion
to a high value-added products has been continually explored.5 Because of the attendance of phenolic, hydroxyl,
methoxy, carbonyl, carboxyl, and aldehyde groups, lignin and its derivatives
are endowed with exclusive uses such as antioxidants, antimicrobial
agents, in removal of heavy metal ions and toxic dyes, carbon precursors,
UV adsorbents, and biomaterials for gene therapy and tissue engineering;6−12 progressive lignin modification has created various
functional lignin-based materials with unique properties.13

The preparation of heterogeneous catalysts
has been extensively investigated in contrast to homogeneous counterparts
because of recyclability, facile work-up, and ease of handling.14,15 Among heterogeneous catalysts, magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) have
garnered abundant attention owing to their low cost, stability and
toxicity, high reactivity, good biocompatibility, easy separation
by an external magnet, and importantly, the small size, large surface
area, and good magnetic permeability.16−21

The C–C coupling
reactions22 like Sonogashira,23 Suzuki–Miyaura,24 Hiyama,25 and Heck26 represent strong synthetic tools to generate new natural
products, heterocycles, molecular electronics, dendrimers, and conjugated
polymers. Among these, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions offer
an effective process for the preparation of pharmaceuticals because
of compatibility of functional groups and accessibility of organoboron
compounds under mild reaction conditions;27,28 Pd-catalyzed
C–C coupling reactions are one of the most important advancements
in synthetic organic chemistry due to high production yields, fast
reaction rates, high turnover frequency, and selectivity.29,30

We envisioned an efficient method for the fabrication of the
Pd(II) complex supported on Fe3O4-lignosulfonate
(FLA-Pd) (Scheme 1)
and demonstrate its prowess for the phosphine-free Suzuki–Miyaura
reaction (Scheme 2)
in water as a non-toxic solvent wherein lignin biopolymer, a renewable
resource, functions as a natural support for the immobilization of
Pd complex.

Results and Discussion
FLA-Pd Characterization
The characterization
of the FLA-Pd was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and thermogravimetry
differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) techniques. An XRD pattern
of the prepared FLA-Pd was applied for lignosulfonate adsorption on
the Fe3O4 surface (Figure 1).

Figure 1 XRD patterns of the FLA-Pd.

The XRD pattern of FLA-Pd was very
similar to that of the magnetic NPs, implying that the crystal Fe3O4 did not change, and magnetic NPs have been coated
with lignosulfonate.

The patterns at 2θ values 28.6°, 35.8°,
50.4°, 57.6°, and 63.1° can be attributed to (2 2 0),
(3 1 1), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) planes of the cubic structure
of Fe3O4 (JCPDS 19-0629), demonstrating the
crystalline structure of Fe3O4. In addition,
the presence of palladium and its immobilization on the Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@5-amino-1H-tetrazole
was confirmed with the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40.8°,
47.3°, 68.5° attributed to (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0)
crystal planes of face-centered Pd.

FT-IR spectroscopy was applied
for the characterization of the functionality of calcium lignosulfonate
(A), Fe3O4-lignosulfonate (B), Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@(CH2)3–Cl
(C), FLA (D), and FLA-Pd (E) (Figure 2). In Figure 2A–E, the peak at 3000–3500 and 1000–1200
and 1050–1200 cm–1 is because of stretching
vibrations of the O–H, C–O, and O=S=O
in calcium lignosulfonate, respectively. The peak appeared at 1400
cm–1 is attributed to aromatic carbons that exist
in calcium lignosulfonate (Figure 2A). The formation of Fe3O4-lignosulfonate
and its sustainability until the last stage was approved by the peak
appeared at 585 cm–1, which is ascribed to the vibration
of Fe–O in the Fe3O4 MNPs (Figure 2B–E). The peak at 1600
cm–1 is also linked to the C=O stretching
mode in Fe3O4-lignosulfonate (Figure 2B). The peaks at 2800–3000
and 1400–1500 cm–1 may be assigned to C–H
stretching and bending vibrations of CH2 groups (Figure 2C). Finally, the
band around 1450 cm–1 indicated the N=N stretching
vibrations of the 5-amino-1H-tetrazole (Figure 2D,E).

of calcium
lignosulfonate (A), Fe3O4-lignosulfonate (B),
Fe3O4@lignosulfonate–(CH2)3–Cl (C), FLA (D), and FLA-Pd (E).

The chemical
composition of calcium lignosulfonate, Fe3O4-lignosulfonate, and the FLA-Pd was analyzed at each stage by the
EDS analysis (Figure 3), which confirms the existence of the desired elements in their
chemical structure; the EDS spectrum of the lignosulfonate confirmed
that it comprised S, C, O, and Ca (Figure 3A). Figure 3 confirmed that C, O, S, Fe, and Ca were main components
present in both Fe3O4-lignosulfonate and FLA-Pd
along with N, Si, Pd, Cl, K, and I elements, which were present only
in the FLA-Pd (Figure 3C), further reaffirming the formation of the final catalyst. Additionally,
the existence of C, N, O, Fe, and Pd was emphasized with elemental
mapping images (Figure 4); which showed that Pd is dispersed uniformly on the FLA surface.

mapping of the FLA-Pd.

FESEM images of calcium lignosulfonate, Fe3O4-lignosulfonate, and the FLA-Pd are presented in Figure 5. According to the FESEM analysis
results, the shapes of the calcium lignosulfonate are irregular (Figure 5A), while Fe3O4-lignosulfonate has a spherical morphology (Figure 5B). Also, the FLA-Pd
show an average particle size in the 20–27 nm range with a
spherical morphology. The morphology of the FLA-Pd was also investigated
using TEM images (Figure 6), which corroborates FESEM findings.

apparent from FESEM images
of lignosulfonate (A), Fe3O4-lignosulfonate
(B), and the FLA-Pd (C).

Figure 6 TEM images of the FLA-Pd.

The results of
TG-DTA analysis of FLA-Pd are shown in Figure 7. There are six clear weight loss peaks discernible
in the TG-DTA curves. The first weight loss, in the range 30–200
°C, was caused by the elimination of physically absorbed H2O within the Ca lignosulfonate and desorption of organic solvents.
The second loss occurred in range 200–290 °C, which is
attributed to the cleavage of C–O–C and C–C chemical
bonds and other organic moieties. The next weight loss in 300 is due
to the decomposition of the calcium lignosulfonate framework, which
was associated with the release of small molecules including oxygen,
calcium, carbon, sulfur, and hydrogen. The fourth stage, in 400 °C
range, corresponds to the disintegration of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole monohydrate. Further, a weight loss was detected in 600
°C, which is caused by the carbonization and decomposition of
calcium lignosulfonate and its aromatic rings. The last stage was
found in 800 °C, attributed to decomposition of the nanocatalyst.

Figure 7 TG-DTA analysis of the
FLA-Pd.

The magnetic hysteresis loop of the FLA-Pd is illustrated in Figure 8; a magnetic behavior
was investigated with the field sweeping in the range of −15 000
to +15 000 Oe. The results acknowledge that the FLA possessed
sensitive magnetic responsiveness, which can be easily removed by
deploying an external magnet.

FLA-Pd-Catalyzed
Suzuki–Miyaura Reaction
The catalytic applicability
of the FLA-Pd was examined for the Suzuki–Miyaura reaction
of iodobenzene with C6H5B(OH)2 as
a model reaction. The reaction was carried out deploying 0.05 g of
the FLA-Pd and 2.0 mmol of K2CO3 under reflux
conditions in H2O as a green solvent; the absence of the
FLA-Pd did not produce any coupling reaction, and no coupling product
could be observed.

To optimize the catalytic reaction conditions
of the PhI (1.0 mmol) with PhB(OH)2 (1.1 mmol) using FLA-Pd,
various bases such as K2CO3, NaOAc, NaHCO3, n-Pr3N, Et3N, and solvents namely tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene,
H2O, and EtOH were screened (Table 1); high yield of the favorable product was
discerned when the reaction was performed in water using FLA-Pd (0.05
g) and K2CO3 (2.0 mmol) at 100 °C for 1
h (entry 1).

The reaction between PhB(OH)2 and aryl
halides bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups
was performed, and they all afforded biphenyl derivatives in 81–93%
yields within 1–2 h using 0.05 g of the FLA-Pd in H2O (Table 2); chlorobenzene
produced the corresponding product in good yield as well (entry 13).
The melting points of all of biaryls were consistent with the recorded
literature values.

Furthermore, we checked the catalytic superiority
and remarkable features of FLA-Pd in comparison to reported catalytic
systems in the literature for Suzuki–Miyaura reaction in H2O or H2O/EtOH and H2O/DMF mixture (Table 3). Clearly, the FLA-Pd
provided higher yields in a shorter reaction time and higher catalytic
activity in comparison to other catalysts.

Catalyst Recyclability
The recyclability of the catalyst
system is one of the prominent issues from the standpoint of cost-effectiveness
and environmental impact. The FLA-Pd nanocatalyst could be collected
via an external magnet because of its magnetic properties. The recyclability
of the as-prepared FLA-Pd was next examined using the Suzuki coupling
reaction of PhB(OH)2 with PhI in the presence of K2CO3 under reflux conditions in water. As shown
in Figure 9, the FLA-Pd
can be reused at least seven times, with minor fluctuation in yields.
As shown in the TEM and FESEM images of the recycled FLA-Pd (Figures S1 and S2), no clear variation in the
morphology of the FLA-Pd and its size was discerned.

Conclusions
This study introduces a
new, efficient, and eco-friendly approach for Suzuki–Miyaura
coupling reaction through the fabrication of a highly active and sustainable
catalytic system using a calcium lignosulfonate biopolymer as a renewable
resource and natural support for the immobilization of the 5-amino-1H-tetrazole-Pd(II) complex. The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling
reaction was performed for an assorted array of aryl halides in H2O as a greener solvent, and consistently high yields of the
biaryls were obtained. In addition, the synthesized catalyst could
be reused for successive seven cycles with high efficiency. The use
of renewable and abundant resource materials bodes well for its application
in other heterogeneous catalytic systems.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Methods
All chemicals were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. and were
directly used for the fabrication of catalyst and biaryls. FT-IR spectra
using a Thermo Nicolet 370 FT-IR spectrometer were used to record
the functional groups in the 400–4000 cm–1 range. TEM and FESEM analyses were used to determine the particle
size and morphology using Philips CM120 and Cam scan Mv2300, respectively.
The chemical composition analysis of the FLA-Pd was performed using
EDS in the FESEM system. XRD analysis was obtained by using a Philips
PW 1373 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα = 1.5406 Å) in a 2θ
range 10°–80° to evaluate the structure of the FLA-Pd.
TG-DTG and VSM measurements were performed by using a STA 1500 Rheometric
Scientific (England) and Quantum Design MPMS 5XL SQUID magnetometer,
respectively.

Preparation of Fe3O4-Lignosulfonate
For the synthesis of
Fe3O4-lignosulfonate, calcium lignosulfonate
was activated with potassium periodate (KIO4) as its functional
groups (CHO, OMe, PhOH, and OH) are occupied in interunit linkages;
functional group activation help assist its binding to the surface
of Fe3O4. Calcium lignosulfonate was dissolved
in the dioxane/water (9:1, v/v) (solution 1) to which aqueous solution
of potassium periodate (solution 2) was added in the dark; solution
2 was added with a peristaltic pump into solution 1. Then, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) were added to the preactivated
calcium lignosulfonate at pH = 6.4, in mass ratios 5:1 for 2 h. The
final solution was filtered, and the ensuing Fe3O4-lignosulfonate was washed with EtOH and dried at 110 °C (Scheme 2A).

Preparation of Fe3O4@Lignosulfonate@5-Amino-1H-tetrazole
Fe3O4@lignosulfonate@5-amino-1H-tetrazole (FLA) was obtained by adding (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane
(3.0 mL) to 1.0 g Fe3O4-lignosulfonate taken
in dry toluene (80.0 mL) under reflux conditions and a nitrogen atmosphere
for 12 h (Scheme 2B).
The synthesized Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@(CH2)3–Cl was decanted via a magnet, washed
with diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum at 70 °C for
5 h. Next, 5.0 mmol of 5-amino-1H-tetrazole, 2.0
g of the Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@(CH2)3–Cl, 5.0 mmol of K2CO3,
and 50.0 mL of DMF were admixed in a flask and refluxed for 24 h.
The ensuing Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@(CH2)3–Cl can be easily collected and used for the
next stage (Scheme 2C).

Preparation of the FLA-Pd Complex
Finally, the Fe3O4-lignosulfonate@(CH2)3–Cl (1.0) and 0.5 g of PdCl2 were mixed in EtOH (50.0 mL) and heated at 80 °C for 24 h.
Then, the obtained complex was collected with an external magnet,
washed with EtOH, dried, and then used as a new magnetic catalyst
in the next cycle (Scheme 2D).

Suzuki–Miyaura
Coupling Reaction
A round-bottomed flask was filled with
1.1 mmol of C6H5B(OH)2, 1.0 mmol
of aryl halide, 2.0 mmol of K2CO3, 0.05 g of
FLA-Pd, and 10 mL of water and stirred under reflux conditions for
the adequate time. The conversion of aryl halide was checked by thin-layer
chromatography. When the reaction was completed, the catalyst was
decanted using an external magnetic field, and the coupling product
was then purified by flash chromatography. The obtained biaryls were
characterized by melting point and confirmed by NMR.
