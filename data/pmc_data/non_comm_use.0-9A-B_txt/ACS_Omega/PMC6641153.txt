Poly(propylene
carbonate) (PPC) polyol
derived from carbon dioxide has been used to make a tough biobased
interpenetrating polymer network (IPN). PPC polyol (10, 20, and 30
phr) was added to an epoxy/poly(furfuryl alcohol) IPN, and the effect
of PPC polyol on the tensile modulus, tensile strength, tensile toughness,
and notched Izod impact strength was determined. Dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) was used to investigate the effect of PPC polyol on
the glass-transition temperature. Loss area (LA) as a characteristic
of IPN damping properties was evaluated using DMA. Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to obtain
more information on the morphology of IPNs on the micro- and nanoscale.
It was found that the incorporation of PPC polyol improved the notched
Izod impact strength and tensile toughness up to 190 and 220%, respectively.
The damping factor peak was broadened with the addition of PPC polyol,
and the glass-transition temperature was decreased as the amount of
PPC polyol increased. The IPN with 20 phr PPC polyol exhibited better
damping properties than neat epoxy and the epoxy/PFA IPN. SEM and
AFM images revealed that PPC polyol domains were dispersed in the
epoxy phase with an average diameter of around 280 nm.

Introduction
Climate change agreement
by the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in December 2015, and parties
have committed to limit the increase in global temperature to below
2 °C. This requires stabilization of the concentration of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere (carbon sequestration), particularly carbon
dioxide.1,2 Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of combustion
of fossil fuels,3 and fossil fuels are
still an integral part of our energy sources. It is predicted that
it will account for about 80% of energy consumption in 2040.4 On the other hand, it is predicted that raw materials
derived from fossil fuels will be depleted in the next few decades.5 Thus, it is important to implement approaches
to utilize renewable resources and mitigate CO2 emission
for a sustainable society.5 In addition
to all attempts that are being made to tap renewable energy and develop
green products, reduction of carbon dioxide emission and development
of carbon neutral strategies should be necessitated to alleviate catastrophic
climate change effects. Trapping CO2 as an inexpensive
C1 feedstock and converting it into chemicals and fuels can help in
reducing emission across the world.4

Utilization of poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC) and PPC polyol can
be one of the complementary alternatives toward carbon neutralization.
PPC was synthesized by alternating copolymerization of carbon dioxide
and propylene oxide in the presence of a rudimentary catalyst at the
end of 1960s. Due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, flexibility,
and high fixation of carbon dioxide, its commercialization reached
to 1000 tons/year.6−8 PPC can be used in the development of polymer scaffolds,
nanofibers, plastics, elastomers, foams, adhesives, and coatings.9,10 Despite the above-mentioned great potential, practical application
of PPC is still a challenge and limited to specialty polymers due
to its low glass transition.7 Therefore,
finding new approaches to utilize PPC is an ongoing challenge for
both academy and industry.

Epoxy resins are among the most widely
used thermosets, and their
projected production by the year 2017 is 3 million tons.11 They have various applications in coating, adhesive,
aerospace, and automotive industries. However, their applications
have been limited due to their intrinsic brittleness as a result of
their high crosslink density.12 Fracture
toughness can be improved by incorporation of a second phase in the
epoxy matrix, either hard or soft, such as rubber, thermoplastics,
and nanoparticles.13

On the other
hand, most of the commercial epoxy resins are petroleum
based and are not the lowest cost thermoset resins.11 Although, in the recent years, much effort has been devoted
to developing epoxy resins derived from renewable resources, including
tannins, cardanol, lignin, and vegetable oils,11 there are not many biobased epoxy resins available in the
market. Partial replacement of petroleum based epoxy resins with commercially
available biobased thermosets14 and making
biobased interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) can be alternative
measures to increase the biobased content.

IPNs are composed
of at least two polymers that are not chemically
bonded, but the components cannot be separated because of entanglement
of chains.15 Production of IPNs is an effective
way to increase the energy absorption ability, improve damping properties,
and increase toughness.16

Poly(furfuryl
alcohol) (PFA) can be a good biobased thermoset candidate
to incorporate into an epoxy matrix. It is synthesized by the condensation
polymerization of furfuryl alcohol (FA) in the presence of an acidic
catalyst. FA is the product of hydrolysis of furfural derived from
lignocellulosic feedstock.17−19 PFA has been used in foundry
molds, as adhesives for wood, and as precursors of graphitic materials.18,20−22 In recent years, scientists have developed PFA composites,20,23,24 although there are not enough
of studies on epoxy and PFA IPNs. Woodson et al.25 invented a new acid curable composition containing epoxy
and furan resin for concrete structures. It was found that the mentioned
composition had better compression strength and was more resistant
to stress cracking than conventional polymer concrete materials. Pin
et al.26 copolymerized epoxidized linseed
oil (ELO) and FA. It was found that the weight ratio of 50% ELO and
50% FA showed a ductile behavior with 40% elongation at break, although
a drastic decrease in tensile strength (around 81%) in comparison
to that of neat PFA was observed.26 Mashouf
et al.27 investigated the hybridization
effect of PFA and epoxidized soybean oil in a biobased epoxy matrix.
It was found that incorporation of 25% PFA and 5% ESO can increase
the notched Izod impact strength by 76%.

In this study, we aimed
to prepare an epoxy/PFA IPN to increase
the biobased content of the final product. Because both PFA and epoxy
resin are brittle in nature, addition of a toughening agent is required.
Reflecting on the green approach and the value-added product that
we are looking for, PPC polyol has been selected to overcome the brittleness
of the selected matrix. Because of low Tg and compatibility of its backbone with epoxy and PFA, it can be
considered as a good candidate to toughen the epoxy/PFA IPN. To the
best of our knowledge, there is only one study on the toughening of
an epoxy matrix with PPC,28 and further
in-depth studies are required to evaluate its effect in thermosets.
Huang et al.28 added polypropylene carbonate
into an epoxy resin. Methyl tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (MTHPA) was
used as a curing agent, and it was found that PPC can improve the
toughness of the epoxy resin. In two recent studies,7,29 a triblock copolymer of PPC and poly(ε-caprolactone) was synthesized
and added into the epoxy matrix. It was found that the tensile toughness
of the epoxy resin improved upon addition of the triblock copolymer,
although the tensile strength reduced.

In the present study,
the effect of addition of PPC polyol in the
epoxy/PFA matrix was investigated. PPC polyol (10, 20, and 30 phr)
was added into the epoxy/PFA crosslinked network. The effect of PPC
polyol addition on the tensile strength, tensile modulus, and notched
Izod impact strength was studied. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
was used to find the damping properties of the thermoset. The morphology
of the thermosets on the micro- and nanoscale was investigated using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Results
and Discussion
Mechanical Properties
Tensile test
and notched Izod
notched impact tests were performed to understand the mechanical properties
of the thermoset samples. Figure 1 shows the stress–strain curve of all cured
formulations. A significant transition from brittle behavior in E,
EP, and EP-10 to ductile response in EP-20 and EP-30 was observed.
The values of tensile strength and modulus can be found in Figure 2. Also, the area
under the stress versus strain curve was calculated and presented
as tensile toughness and can be found in Figure 3. The area under the stress versus strain
curve can be considered a measure of the toughness of the material
and representative of energy for crack initiation and propagation.
For a valid comparison, analysis of variance was performed. Mean comparisons
of all mechanical responses were analyzed using Fisher’s least
significance difference (LSD) method with a significance level of
0.05 (α = 0.05). Figures S1–S4 show Fisher’s LSD curves of all responses. In the graphs,
if an interval does not contain zero, it means that the corresponding
response means are significantly different at the determined α
level.

Figure 2 Tensile strength and tensile modulus of E, EP, EP-10,
EP-20, and
EP-30.

Figure 3 Tensile toughness of E, EP, EP-10, EP-20, and
EP-30.

The tensile strength and modulus
of neat epoxy (E) are 54.04 MPa
and 2.7 GPa, respectively. Incorporation of 15% PFA into the epoxy
matrix increased the tensile strength to 62.48 MPa. In addition, the
presence of the PFA network with a higher modulus20 in the epoxy matrix increased the tensile modulus to 3.95
GPa, as expected. Addition of 10 phr PPC did not change the tensile
strength significantly, whereas further addition of PPC polyol reduced
the tensile strength of the matrix. A similar trend was observed by
addition of the PPC/PCL copolymer into the epoxy matrix.7 It can be observed that incorporation of soft
PPC chains reduced the tensile modulus. It can be found that the addition
of PPC polyol had a positive effect on the improvement of the toughness
of the epoxy/PFA matrix. Addition of 10, 20, and 30 phr PPC polyol
increased the tensile toughness of the epoxy/PFA matrix by around
91, 220, and 84%, respectively. In addition, there is no significant
difference between the toughness of E and EP. It is worth mentioning
that EP-20 also exhibited better tensile toughness than neat epoxy
(i.e., E). Because PPC polyol is a soft phase in the IPN matrix, it
is assumed that cavitation of PPC particles and localized shear yielding
of the matrix are the main toughening mechanisms.30 The observed results are in good agreement with those of
Chen et al.7 and Liu et al.29 They added a block copolymer of PPC and poly(ε-caprolactone)
into the epoxy resin and found a decrease in tensile strength and
an increase in toughness.

The notched Izod impact strength of
all thermoset formulations
can be found in Figure 4. The notched Izod impact strength values represent the response
of formulations to a high strain rate. Addition of 20 and 30 phr PPC
polyol significantly increased the impact energy of the epoxy/PFA
matrix by 36 and 191%. Impact strengths of EP-20 and EP-30 are also
higher than that of the neat epoxy matrix, exhibiting their better
response to the high strain rate than neat epoxy. Huang et al.28 found that incorporation of PPC into the epoxy
resin cured by MTHPA can improve the impact strength of the epoxy
matrix.

DMA
To find the
glass-transition temperature and time–temperature-dependent
motion of IPN segments, DMA studies were performed. Figure 5 shows the storage modulus
and tan δ of E, EP, EP-10, EP-20, and EP-30. α-Transitions
of E, EP, EP-10, EP-20, and EP-30 are 138, 104, 73, 54, and 42 °C,
respectively. A comparison of cured neat epoxy (E) with EP IPN showed
a decrease in glass-transition temperature, and it can be related
to the lower crosslink density of EP, as shown in Table 1. The crosslink density was
calculated according to rubber elasticity theory and using ν
= E′/3RT, where ν, E′, R, and T are
the crosslink density (mol m–3), storage modulus
at Tg + 30 K, gas constant, and absolute
temperature, respectively.7,31 Moreover, it can be
found that the addition of PPC polyol in the epoxy/PFA matrix reduced
the glass-transition temperature. Addition of PPC polyol also broadened
the damping factor peak. Reduction in glass-transition temperature
and broadening of loss factor upon addition of PPC into an epoxy matrix
were previously reported by Huang et al.28 The reduction in glass-transition temperature can be related to
the lower crosslink density of samples (see Table 1) and the plasticization effect of PPC soft
chains. Tensile and impact tests were performed at room temperature
(around 25 °C). Hence, EP-20 and EP-30 are in their leathery
region. This means that samples are tough and side group motions in
the network can happen. In addition, the observed β-transitions
in E and EP are mainly related to hydroxyl ether, methyl, and diphenyl
ether groups,7,26 whereas β-transitions cannot
be specified in EP-10, EP-20, and EP-30 due to broadening of the damping
factor peak. It is worth mentioning that the glass-transition temperature
was also obtained using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and
the results are shown in Table S3. Although
the numbers were different due to difference in the measurement method
of DSC and DMA, a similar decreasing trend was observed.

and tan δ graphs of E, EP, EP-10, EP-20,
and EP-30.

To quantitatively
compare the damping properties of samples, the
area under the loss modulus curve was calculated. Loss area (LA) can
be considered as a better characteristic to compare damping properties,
as the engineering products are used in a range of temperatures, not
a specific temperature. The LA was calculated based on the method
proposed by Fay et al.32 and the lower
integration limit was chosen to be −25 °C. Figure 6 shows LA of thermoset IPNs.
As can be seen, damping properties of the epoxy/PFA IPN improved with
addition of soft PPC chains, and EP-20 exhibited the highest LA. Because
change in LA is mainly related to the chemical composition and morphology
in multicomponent systems,32 the morphology
of samples was studied using SEM and AFM.

Figure 6 Comparison of LA of samples.

Morphology
Morphology
is an important characteristic
in IPNs with good damping properties. Figure 7A–C shows SEM micrographs of etched,
impact-fractured E, EP, and EP-20. Figure 7A showed a surface with sharp edges. This
micrograph is attributed to a brittle fracture that is well known
in an epoxy matrix.26 Because PFA chains
can swell when in contact with acetone, the crosslinked PFA network
can be easily distinguished in the epoxy matrix (Figure 7B). Moreover, PPC polyol can
be dissolved in acetone. It is worth mentioning that 4 days of etching
was chosen in this study based on our preliminary observations. It
was difficult and even impossible to observe the PFA network on fractured
surfaces with shorter etching time in acetone (i.e., 24 h). Figure 7B shows interconnected
PFA chains in the epoxy matrix, but the fractured surface has sharp
edges, confirming the lower impact strength of EP in comparison to
that of EP-20.

Figure 7 SEM micrograph of etched, impact-fractured E (A), EP (B),
and EP-20
(C) and cryo-fractured surface of EP-10 (D), EP-20 (E), and EP-30
(F).

A study of the EP-20 fractured
surface showed rough surfaces in
epoxy regions. This means that PPC polyol chains are mainly distributed
in the epoxy matrix and made it tougher; however, the PPC polyol distribution
cannot be clearly distinguished from impact specimens. To investigate
the distribution of PPC polyol in the matrix, cryo-fractured samples
with 30 min etching in acetone are shown in Figure 7D–F. From cryo-fractured surface morphology,
it can be concluded that PPC polyol distributed as spherical domains
with an average size of around 280 nm, and the size of PPC polyol
domains did not vary with change in PPC polyol content. It is worth
noting that with a lower amount of PPC polyol (i.e., EP-10), the epoxy
matrix showed a brittle fracture, which is in good agreement with
the observed mechanical properties (see Figure S5). Although no sign of distribution of PPC polyol in the
PFA matrix was observed, AFM was also used to make sure that the observed
gap between the swelled PFA phase and the epoxy phase is not related
to PPC polyol etching.

Due to the higher amount of PPC polyol,
EP-30 was chosen for AFM
scans. PQNM was used to better differentiate between the effect of
topography and mechanical heterogeneity. Figure 8 shows the height and adhesion images of
EP-30, and the deformation image can be found in Figure S6. The dark circles in Figure 8A represent the PPC polyol phase, and image
processing of the height image showed an average diameter of 210 nm,
which is in close agreement with the average diameter found in SEM
images of both EP-20 and EP-30. The adhesion force measured by AFM
is mostly related to the difference in chemical interactions of the
tip and surface33 and can be used to distinguish
epoxy and PFA phases. From Figure 8B, it is evident that PPC polyol domains are mainly
distributed in the epoxy phase and are responsible for toughening
the epoxy/PFA IPN. Smaller scan size (Figure S7) revealed inhomogeneity in the epoxy matrix. Spatial heterogeneity
in an epoxy matrix was a challenging issue for decades and has been
confirmed recently by Morsch et al. using AFM-IR.34 They related the internal nodular morphology of epoxy to
heterogeneous network connectivity in an epoxy matrix. In our case,
scans of EP-30 in the epoxy region and also scans of E and EP samples
revealed nanosize nodular heterogeneity in the structure.

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a biobased tough
IPN through addition
of PPC polyol in an epoxy/PFA matrix. Mechanical properties, morphology,
and dynamic mechanical properties of the samples with a change in
the amount of PPC polyol (10, 20, and 30 phr) were studied. Addition
of 20 and 30 phr of PPC polyol into the IPN increased its notched
Izod impact strength by 36 and 191%, respectively. The improvement
was related to the presence of a PPC soft phase in the brittle matrix
that could absorb energy. The observed behavior was further described
using SEM and AFM. SEM micrographs showed PPC polyol was mainly distributed
in the epoxy phase with an average diameter of 280 nm. AFM images
confirmed the same finding. Using SEM and AFM techniques, it was found
that the PFA phase is randomly distributed in the epoxy matrix. Also,
EP-10, EP-20, and EP-30 showed around 91, 220, and 84% increase in
tensile toughness, respectively. The LA of EP-20 increased in comparison
to that of EP, confirming the improved damping properties of EP-20.
DMA results showed a reduction in glass-transition temperature and
confirmed that EP-20 and EP-30 were in their leathery region, which
provides more evidence for their ability to damp energy.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A epoxy resin
(Epon 828) and triethylenetetramine (Epikure 3234) were purchased
from Hexion. The amount of hardener for all samples was chosen based
on stoichiometry. Epoxy cured with the amine hardener is referred
to as “E” hereafter. PPC polyol with a molecular weight
of 2000 (Converge polyol 212-20) was purchased from Novomer. The polyol
is a diol, and around 40% of its mass contains carbon dioxide. Water-insoluble
homopolymer of FA resin (QuaCorr 1300) was purchased from Penn A Kem.
QuaCorr 2001, a mixture of 1,2-benzenedicarbonyl dichloride and dimethyl
phthalate, was purchased from Penn a Kem, and 5% of it (based on the
weight of PFA in the formulation) was used as a catalyst. Weight ratio
of 85/15 (epoxy/PFA) was chosen for all IPNs. This ratio was chosen
based on our preliminary studies and was selected to reach the highest
possible biobased content, minimize uncrosslinked furan resin, and
also balance the mechanical properties, including the tensile, flexural,
and impact strengths. More information on the effect of epoxy/PFA
ratio can be found in the Supporting Information. Cured epoxy/PFA IPN was called “EP”. To study the
effect of PPC polyol, 10, 20, and 30 phr of PPC polyol were used,
and cured samples are referred to as “EP-10”, “EP-20”,
and “EP-30”, respectively. Table 2 shows a summary of sample designations.

Table 2 Summary of Weight Ratio and Sample
Designations
sample designation	epoxy/PFA (wt %)	PPC polyol

E	100/0	0	
EP	85/15	0	
EP-10	85/15	10	
EP-20	85/15	20	
EP-30	85/15	30	
Sample Preparation
In the case of E and EP samples,
materials were mixed properly using a mechanical stirrer. EP-10, EP-20,
and EP-30 were prepared by mixing epoxy and PPC polyol in an oil bath
at 80 °C until complete disappearance of PPC polyol. Then, the
mixture was degassed overnight at room temperature. Then, QuaCorr
1300, QuaCorr 2001, and Epikure 3234 were added to the mixture and
mixed properly. A Carver hydraulic press (model 4128) was used to
cure all samples, and all samples were cured under the same conditions.
The mixture was poured into a rectangular mold (23 cm × 23 cm
× 3 mm) and held at 90 °C under 6000 psi gauge pressure
for 2 h and at 150 °C under 6000 psi for 4 h. It is worth noting
that the curing temperature and time were chosen according to preliminary
studies. The cured samples were cooled to room temperature by the
circulation of water through platens, and the cooling cycle was 5
min. Complete curing of samples was confirmed by the absence of any
exothermic peak in DSC graphs, and all tests were performed after
at least 48 h of curing.

Methods
Mechanical Test
Tensile and impact samples were cut
using a computer numeric controlled mill (VF-4, Haas Automation Inc.)
according to ASTM D638 and D256. Tensile tests were carried out at
room temperature using an Instron testing machine (model 3382) with
a 5
kN load cell. Type IV samples were used for the tensile test, and
the crosshead speed was set at 5 mm/min. Young’s modulus and
tensile strength values are average of at least five measurements.

Notched Izod impact energies of samples were measured using a Testing
Machine Inc. (TMI) instrument according to ASTM D256, and the values
are an average of at least six replicates. The impact test was performed
after at least 40 h of notching.

DMA
DMA measurements
were conducted using a Q800 machine
from TA instruments in dual cantilever mode. Rectangular specimens
with dimensions of 3.2 × 12.5 × 65 mm3 were used.
The tests were carried out by heating the samples from −80
to 150 °C at a heating rate of 3 mm/min and oscillating stress
of 1 Hz.

SEM
A Phenom ProX scanning electron microscope (Phenom-World
BV, Eindhoven) was used to study the fracture surface of samples.
The accelerating voltage was 10 kV to collect images. Impact-fractured
samples were etched in acetone for 4 days and were used for morphology
studies. Also, cryo-fractured samples were prepared by soaking rectangular
bars in liquid nitrogen for 1 h. The surfaces of all samples were
gold coated by sputtering using a Cressington 108 Sputter Coater (Cressington
Scientific Instruments Ltd., Watford, UK).

AFM
Nanoscope
Multimode 8 (Bruker) with a Nanoscope
V controller and Nanoscope 8.10 software in peak force quantitative
nanomechanical (PFQNM) mode was used. An RTESPA-300 silicon probe
was used to scan the surface of samples. To make a flat surface, samples
were microtomed using Leica Ultracut (Leica, Germany). Deflection
sensitivity was calibrated using ramp on sapphire. Relative calibration
method on the polystyrene film (Bruker) was used before the scan.
The tip radius and spring constant were estimated to be 40 nm and
20 N/m, respectively. The image resolution was 512 per line, and the
scan rate was 1 Hz. Adhesion and height channel images were exported
using Nanoscope analysis 1.50, and Adobe Photoshop CS6 was used for
image processing.
