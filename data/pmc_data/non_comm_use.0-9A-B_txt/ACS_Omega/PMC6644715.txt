Organic
semiconductor-based thin-film transistors’ (TFTs)
charge-carrier mobility has been enhanced up to 25 cm2/V
s through the improvement of fabrication methods and greater understanding
of the microstructure charge-transport mechanism. To expand the practical
feasibility of organic semiconductor-based TFTs, their electrical
properties should be easily accessed from the fully printed devices
through a scalable printing method, such as a roll-to-roll (R2R) gravure.
In this study, four commercially available organic semiconductors
were separately formulated into gravure inks. They were then employed
in the R2R gravure system (silver ink for printing gate and drain–source
electrodes and BaTiO3 ink for printing dielectric layers)
for printing 20 × 20 TFT-active matrix with the resolution of
10 pixels per inch on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) foils to
attain electrical properties of organic semiconductors a practical
printing method. Electrical characteristics (mobility, on–off
current ratio, threshold voltage, and transconductance) of the R2R
gravure-printed 20 × 20 TFT-active matrices fabricated with organic
semiconducting ink were analyzed statistically, and the results showed
more than 98% device yield and 50 % electrical variations in
the R2R gravure TFT-active matrices along the PET web.

Introduction
During
the past two decades, printed electronics has been developed
for manufacturing novel flexible and large electronic devices with
low functionality, such as passive radio frequency identification
tags, digital signage, e-papers, and wireless sensors.1−3 However, to date, there are no commercial products in the category
of fully printed thin-film transistor (TFT)-based electronic devices
because Si-based devices prevail in the competition to commercialize
TFT-based devices. To have competitiveness over Si-based devices,
printed TFT-based electronic devices should prove their superior scalability
to mass-produce flexible large-area devices through a roll-to-roll
(R2R) printing method as a typical advanced manufacturing system4−7 because the flexible large-area TFT-based devices are difficult
to manufacture using current photolithography and vacuum deposition
technologies, which are generally used in Si technology.

An
R2R gravure has been recently demonstrated as a potential advanced
manufacturing technology to fabricate TFT-active matrix (TFT-AM)-based
tactile sensors on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) roll using silver-nanoparticle-based
conducting ink, BaTiO3-nanoparticle-based dielectric ink,
and carbon-nanotube-based semiconducting ink.8,9 Those
inks were all formulated to meet the continuous R2R gravure printing
with a printing speed of 6 m/min using a thermal curing chamber with
length of 1 m under 150 °C, and R2R-printed TFTs were operated
under a reasonable direct current (DC) voltage (<20 V). To meet
the printing speed of 6 m/min, all inks should be cured in 5 s at
150 °C in a 1 m long drying chamber. The chamber length can be
shorter or longer depending on the curing time of the employed inks.
Furthermore, because all employed solvents were Environmental Protection
Agency-approved for printing, the reported R2R gravure system (R2R
gravure machine, PET film, and electronic inks) can be quickly adapted
in a practical production line to optimize the yield of TFT-based
electronic devices.

For continuous development of the expansion
of the R2R gravure
system to organic semiconductor (OSC)-based TFTs, the R2R gravure
system, including the PET substrate and the conducting and dielectric
inks, should be evaluated comparatively with organic semiconductor
inks to prove the scalability of the R2R gravure system. Because the
semiconducting layer in printed TFTs is very vulnerable to the condition
of the printed layers, the selection of semiconductors will often
lead to failure or poorly printed TFT devices through amplifying the
surface properties of the printed dielectric layer and mismatched
work function of the printed drain–source electrodes.10 On the other hand, the same semiconductors usually
show good electrical properties using a dielectric layer of thermally
grown SiO2 or metal oxides, which can be grown by atomic
layer deposition with a nanometer thickness.11,12 Unlike SiO2 on Si wafer or metal-oxide-based dielectric
layers on glass or plastic films, the surface roughness and polarity
of the printed dielectric layers using BaTiO3 nanoparticle-based
dielectric ink will seriously degrade the mobility of charge carriers
at the interface between the printed dielectric and organic semiconducting
layers.13,14 Because our R2R gravure-printed dielectric
layers usually give roughness in the range of 90–200 nm with
a thickness of 1–3 μm,8,9 a semiconductor
with a low carrier mobility (<1 cm2/V s) would not show
good electrical characteristics in the printed TFTs under a reasonable
DC power (<20 V). Of course, there were some reports about sheet-to-sheet
(S2S) and R2R gravure-printed dielectric layers with very smooth morphology
and lower thickness,15,16 but the reported gravure-printing
methods are all lab scales with a pure polymer dielectric ink so that
the device yield was not an issue. However, the R2R gravure system
in this study is a pilot scale to really test the scalability so that
the device yield is our utmost important issue. To provide the practical
device yield, we needed to optimize the thickness to about 2 μm
because the thinner is the printed dielectric layer, the lower is
the device yield. Furthermore, the work function of R2R gravure-printed
drain–source electrodes should be well matched to the Fermi
level of the semiconductor to avoid serious contact resistance in
the printed TFT devices.17,18 Therefore, evaluating
organic semiconductor-based inks with previously reported conducting
and dielectric inks will be very valuable for not only proving the
scalability of the R2R gravure system but also developing practical
organic semiconducting inks for use in the R2R gravure system, where
the PET substrate, silver-nanoparticle-based conducting ink, and BaTiO3-nanoparticle-based dielectric ink are kept the same.

In this study, commercially available organic semiconductors were
tested to examine the scalability of the R2R gravure system, in which
250 mm wide PET roll, silver-nanoparticle-based conducting ink, and
BaTiO3-nanoparticle-based dielectric ink were employed
to fabricate TFT-active matrix. The reason for choosing the TFT-active
matrix (TFT-AM) to prove the scalability of the R2R gravure system
with organic semiconductor is the advantage of R2R gravure-printed
TFT-AM over conventional photolithography method in terms of costs
of manufacturing and expandability of the device size for developing
digital signages and sensor arrays. Before testing the organic semiconductor
with the R2R gravure system, all selected organic semiconductors were
formulated into semiconducting inks and then printed using a convenient
S2S gravure on the printed TFT template, where the gate and the dielectric
and drain–source electrodes were all printed using R2R gravure
(Scheme 1). After printing
the organic semiconducting inks on the printed TFT template, the organic
semiconductor ink, which showed the gate effect, was selected for
further fabrication into 20 × 20 TFT-AM with 10 pixels per inch
(PPI) resolution using the fully R2R gravure-printing process. The
resulting organic semiconductor-based TFT-AMs in the PET roll were
evaluated by characterizing the electrical properties, device stability,
and device yields to prove the scalability of the organic semiconductor
in fully printing TFT-AMs by the R2R gravure system.

Results and Discussion
Four different
organic semiconductors (poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT), 6,13-bis((triethylsilyl)ethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene),
poly(3,3‴-didodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT-12), and poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT)) were formulated into gravure inks. Table 1 shows the list of
formulated organic semiconductor-based inks with their contact angles
on the printed dielectric layer, ink stability, and device characteristics
(mobility and on–off current ratio from the printed TFT template).
Of the formulated inks, PBTTT showed a reasonable gate effect from
the printed TFT template (Figure S1). This
gate effect may originated from PBTTT’s liquid crystalline
characteristics due to its long flexible alkyl chain on the head unit
of thiophene to render better interface property.19,20 This morphological characteristic would maintain the proximity of
the conjugated units to each other for hopping carriers even on the
rough surface of printed dielectric layers. On the other hand, for
the other three organic semiconductors, the ordered domain of organic
semiconductor would not be formed due to their molecular structures
and the rough surface morphology of dielectric layer so that the charge
accumulation may not be good enough to show the gate effect.21 Because PBTTT-based semiconducting ink with
1-octanol showed better electrical performance than that of the terpineol-based
one (Figure S1), the 1-octanol-based PBTTT
ink was selected to further print 20 × 20 TFT-AM with 10 PPI
resolution using the R2R gravure system.

The topology and cross-sectional
images of each R2R gravure-printed
layer are summarized in Table 2 with the average values of surface roughness and thickness.
The surface roughness of the printed dielectric layer was 98.5 nm
on average. This roughness is the highest value of dielectric layers
reported for PBTTT-based TFTs. The thicknesses of gate electrodes,
dielectric layers, and drain–source electrodes were in the
normal ranges of previously reported values under the same printing
condition.8,9 Unlike the sudden height drop at the channel
edge of the drain–source electrodes fabricated by vacuum deposition
or photolithography, the R2R gravure-printed drain–source electrodes
had an upslope of 30° starting from the channel edge (see the
cross-sectional focused ion beam–scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images in Table 2). This is the most characteristic feature of the R2R gravure-printed
TFTs, which was not observed in fabricated TFTs using vacuum deposition
and photolithography. However, the self-assembled monolayer, crucial
for attaining good PBTTT-based TFT performance,26,28 could not be printed by the R2R gravure due to the practical reason
of maintaining the concept of R2R-based advanced manufacturing system.
Under these practical circumstances, the printed PBTTT layers would
not be very effective in transporting charge carriers in the channel
because large trap sites will be generated at the interface between
PBTTT and BaTiO3.29,30 Furthermore, after
PBTTT was R2R gravure-printed on the printed dielectric layers in
20 × 20 TFT-AM arrays with 10 PPI resolution (Figure 1), the grain sizes of ordered
PBTTT, characterized using AFM, were very small and almost looked
like amorphous films (Figure 1d) due to the rough dielectric layers.31,32 This was why the observed charge-carrier mobility at saturation
was in the range of 1–5 × 10–4 cm2/V s with a printed dielectric capacitance of 7 nF/cm2 and a channel length of 80 μm.

Table 2 Summary
of the Topology of Each R2R
Gravure-Printed Layer with the Average Surface Roughness (Root Mean
Square, RMS)
The selected R2R
gravure-printed 20 × 20 TFT-AM (Figure 1) was spin-coated
using CYTOP (CTX-SP2) (Asahi Glass Co., Japan) to retard the degradation
of PBTTT under ambient condition and light of the prove station for
characterizing the TFTs.33 Without the
CYTOP coating, all TFT pixels in the 20 × 20 TFT-AM quickly degraded
and lost their electrical properties (Figure S2). This device instability was unexpected based on the previously
reported stability under ambient condition because PBTTT was designed
to have a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −5.1
eV to resist oxidation under moisture and UV–vis light.34−36 After the CYTOP coating, the electrical properties of each TFT in
the TFT-AM were not changed noticeably, but after a week, they degraded
slowly and were lost completely (Figure S3). The major reason for the observed unexpected instability of the
printed PBTTT may have originated from the solvent, that is, 1-octanol,
which can donate electrons from the oxygen molecule of 1-octanol to
PBTTT to reduce the HOMO level of PBTTT.37 In fact, from the UV–vis spectroscopy study, the maximum
absorption at 551 nm of PBTTT in 1-octanol shows a red shift compared
to PBTTT in toluene (509 nm) (Figure S4). On the basis of the attained UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
and electrical oxidation–reduction data using cyclic voltammetry
(Figure S5), the calculated HOMO level
of PBTTT ink was about −5.04 eV, that is, in a very vulnerable
range to moisture and UV–vis light.38 From this study, the importance of solvent selection to formulate
electronic ink was proven again, as shown from previously reported
results.27

For statistical analysis,
we first selected five of 20 × 20
TFT-AM along 10 m of the printed web and then 10 TFT pixels per TFT-AM
sample were selected to characterize their electrical properties (Figure S6). On the basis of the attained electrical
properties from each of the five TFT-AM, the average device yield
was approximately 90%. The relationship between the electrical properties
of each TFT-AM along 10 m of the R2R gravure-printed web is shown
in Figure 2 on the
basis of the calculated average values from each TFT-AM. The average
values of mobility, threshold voltage, and transconductance were in
the range of ±50% deviations, whereas the average on–off
current was in the range of ±10% deviations. Furthermore, the
hysteresis in the transfer output characteristics was about 0.78 V
on average with less than ±32% deviations (Figure S7). On the basis of these calculated statistical data,
the scalability of the R2R gravure system was easily extracted and
in the range of ±50% of device deviations with the device yield
of 90%. This result was also consistent with previously reported fully
R2R gravure-printed carbon-nanotube-based TFT-AM with 10 PPI resolution
and proved that the reported R2R gravure system, including silver-nanoparticle-based
ink and BaTiO3-nanoparticle-based ink, is indeed scalable
for organic semiconducting inks to manufacture TFT-AM with ±50%
device deviations and 90% device yields. The device yields were related
to the selected semiconducting ink because the failures of pixel TFTs
were not due to a short, but an open device. Those results indirectly
indicated that inhomogeneous transfer of organic semiconducting ink
from the gravure cylinder to the PET web was the most important issue
to improve the device yield to more than 99%. Furthermore, the deviation
of on–off current ratio from TFTs in the TFT-AM along 10 m
length of the web was in the range of ±10% deviations, whereas
other electrical properties were in the range of ±50% deviations.
Those results implied that the on–off current ratio of the
devices, printed by the R2R gravure system, strongly relied on the
quality of the semiconducting ink.39 In
addition, as aforementioned, the trap sites generated at the interface
of gravure-printed PBTTT layer and BaTiO3 dielectric layer
will degrade the transporting charge carriers at the channel. Therefore,
we carried out the calculation for the trap density of TFTs along
the printed 10 m length using the equation , where ci is
the capacitance of the gate dielectrics and Ntr denotes the trap density, contributed from both the bulk
traps and interface traps.40 The calculated
results are shown Figure S8. Due to the
large trap sites, our R2R-printed device showed the modest mobility.

current ratio (c), average threshold voltage (d), and average transconductance
(e) from the 10 selected TFTs in a single TFT-active matrix at the
first 2 m, second 2 m, third 2 m, fourth 2 m, and fifth 2 m along
the 10 m length of the R2R gravure-printed web.

When 400 TFTs of the selected 20 × 20 TFT-AM were fully
characterized
(Figure 3), the device
yield was 98% with an average mobility of 2 ×10–4 cm2/V s, average on–off current ratio of 102.4, average threshold voltage of 4.1 V, and normalized average
transconductance of 2.4 ×10–6 S/mm. The electrical
properties of 400 TFTs from the single TFT-AM were also in the range
of total variations (±50%) along 10 m of the web. The device
properties about the actual I–V characteristics and the current density of the characterized 400
TFTs are shown in Figure S9. The calculated
average saturation current density was 4.52 × 10–9 A/mm. Due to the rough and thick dielectric layer in our gravure-printing
system, the attained device mobility dramatically reduced from usually
reported values to 2 × 10–4 cm2/V
s. The same phenomenon was also observed from the previous study about
single-walled carbon-nanotube (SWCNT)-based flexible TFTs (SWCNT-TFT),8 fabricated gate, and dielectric and drain–source
electrodes using a hybrid method, such as vacuum deposition with printed
SWCNT layers to yield the mobility of SWCNT-TFT in the range of 10–160
cm2/V s.41,42 However, the mobility of R2R
gravure-printed SWCNT-TFTs (150 000 TFTs) using our gravure
system, optimized to print SWCNT as a semiconducting layer, was in
the range of 0.05–0.3 cm2/V s along 150 m of PET
roll with the device yield of 100 % due to the rough and thick dielectric
layers. On the basis of those results, it would not be hard to speculate
that the scalability in device yield can be kept to the other semiconductors,
whereas the mobility of the devices would be varied due to the interaction
between dielectric layers and semiconducting layers. As expected,
for the organic semiconductor, the R2R gravure system can keep the
device yield in the pilot scale of R2R gravure system, but the mobility
was reduced dramatically as well. Therefore, on the basis of the results
from both fully characterized 400 TFTs in a TFT-AM and 10 selected
TFTs per TFT-AM, it was reasonable to extract the scalability of the
R2R gravure system for printing PBTTT-based TFT-AM with 10 PPI resolution.
The extracted scalability of the R2R gravure system for manufacturing
PBTTT-based TFT-AM with 10 PPI resolution is summarized in Table 3. Furthermore, when
the TFT-AM was bended with a radius of 2.1 cm, the variations of mobility,
on–off current ratio, threshold voltage, and transconductance
were all in the range of ±10% (Figure 4). Although this variation range was slightly
larger than the previously reported values,43,44 the devices were in a stable range under the bending strain and
stress because the larger variation range of the attained electrical
properties may not have originated from the strain or stress of bending
devices but more likely generated by the degradation of PBTTT under
strong light exposure from the prove station due to the lower HOMO
level of printed PBTTT. In addition, for the practical consideration
about the R2R gravure-printed PBTTT-based TFT-AM, the cutoff frequency
was measured on the basis of an inverter circuit with a load resistor
(4 GΩ) (Figure S10). Due to high
parasitic capacitances and low mobility of the printed TFT device,
the low cutoff frequency of 700 mHz was observed, whereas the calculated
average cutoff frequency was 27.5 ± 1.7 Hz using the equation ft = gm/2π(CGS + CGD), where CGS and CGD are parasitic
capacitances.

Conclusions
In conclusion, four
different organic semiconductors (P3HT, TIPS-pentacene,
PQT-12, and PBTTT) were purchased and formulated into gravure inks
using various solvents without any additives and then the printability
was tested by using S2S gravure on the printed TFT templates to screen
out the appropriate semiconducting ink to run R2R gravure. PBTTT and
1-octanol-based semiconducting ink showed the best performance from
the preliminary test due to PBTTT’s liquid crystalline property.
Therefore, the PBTTT-based ink was employed with the R2R gravure system,
which included sliver-nanoparticle-based conducting ink and BaTiO3-nanoparticle-based dielectric ink to fully print PBTTT-based
20 × 20 TFT-AM with 10 PPI resolution along 10 m of PET web.
The attained printed TFTs in TFT-AM show the low mobility originated
from the rough and thick printed dielectric layers that hindered the
crystal formation of PBTTT. Furthermore, unstable device properties
would be generated by low-positioned HOMO level of the ink. However,
along 10 m of PET web, 147 TFT-AM (58 800 TFTs), the average
device yield show more than 90% with the scalable R2R gravure-printing
method. The attained values of the electrical properties from the
TFTs along the 10 m length of the web were statistically analyzed
to prove that scalability of PBTTT-based TFT-AM with ±50% device
variations can be attained using the R2R gravure system (Table 3). In other words,
by simply employing PBTTT ink and R2R gravure system, TFT-AM with
10 PPI resolutions can be R2R-manufactured with a device yield of
90 % and ±50% variations of electrical properties under
the reported R2R gravure system. To improve the printed device performance,
we need to develop a better dielectric ink to print thinner and smoother
dielectric layers. Also, finding an amorphous semiconductor will be
very important to attain reliable printed devices.

Experimental
Section
All organic semiconductor-based inks were formulated
to attain
a minimum viscosity of 1 Cp for use in R2P and R2R gravures (Table 1). We purchased poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT) and 6,13-bis((triethylsilyl)ethynyl)pentacene (TIPS-pentacene)
from Sigma-Aldrich, poly(3,3‴-didodecylquaterthiophene) (PQT-12)
from Solaris Chem Inc., and poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT-C14) from Sigma-Aldrich. To meet the
wetting and drying times on the printed gate dielectric layers and
drain–source electrodes, terpineol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1-octanol
(Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd., Japan) were selected as a vehicle for the
ink formulation, which can dissolve these four semiconductors as the
vehicles for the ink formulation.

The formulated organic semiconducting
ink was kept in a brown bottle
and tested for R2R gravure printing. In this work, R2R gravure with
two color units was manufactured by i-Pen Co., Ltd., Korea, and used
under optimized printing conditions for printing each layers, as summarized
in Table 3. First,
gate electrodes were printed with a printing speed of 6 m/min and
a web tension of 5 kgf using silver ink (PG-007; Paru Co., Ltd., Korea)
and then dielectric layer was continuously printed with the same printing
speed and web tension using dielectric ink (PD-100; Paru Co., Ltd.,
Korea). Second, the resulting web was rewound and then drain–source
electrodes were printed with an overlay printing registration accuracy
of ±20 μm with a printing speed of 6 m/min.8 Third, after printing the drain–source electrodes,
the PET web was rewound to print the PBTTT layers with a printing
speed of 6 m/min and a web tension accuracy of ±0.3 kgf. Finally,
the fully R2R gravure-printed PBTTT-based 20 × 20 TFT-AM with
10 PPI resolution (Figure 1) was characterized every 2 m along the 10 m length of the
printed PET web using semiconductor analyzer (KEITHLEY 4200) under
ambient condition.
