Understanding the
interaction between nanoscale materials and nucleobases is essential
for their use in nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine. Our ab initio
calculations indicate that the interaction of nucleobases [adenine
(A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U)] with
boron–carbon–nitride (BCN) is mainly governed by van
der Waals interactions. The adsorption energies, ranging from −0.560
to −0.879 eV, decrease in the order of G > A > T >
C > U, which can be attributed to π–π interactions
and different side groups of the nucleobases. We found that anions
(N and O atoms) of nucleobases prefer to stay on top of cation (B)
of the substrate. The results also showed that BCN exhibits superior
binding strength than graphene and boron–nitride-based materials.
We also found that upon adsorption, the fundamental properties of
BCN and nucleobases remains unaltered, which suggests that BCN is
a promising template for self-assembly of nucleobases.

Introduction
The adsorption of purine [adenine
(A), guanine (G)] and pyrimidine [cytosine (C), thymine (T), uracil
(U)] nucleobases onto the surfaces of inorganic solids has long been
considered a process relevant to the origin of life.1 The interaction of nucleobases with inert surfaces has
garnered significant attention due to its importance for self-organization
and molecular recognition process.2 Adsorption
of nucleobases on nanomaterials is beneficial for delivering therapeutic
nucleic acids,3,4 developing smart stimuli-responsive
materials,5,6 and designing biosensors.7−9 Two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their
large specific surface area have emerged as a unique platform for
interfacing with nucleobases. Developments in this field were stimulated
by the discovery of graphene.10 Several
nanomaterials, such as quantum dots,11,12 carbon nanotubes,13 and graphene oxide (GO),14−17 have been used
to sense DNA nucleobases (A, C, G, T) using fluorescent18 and calorimetric19 assessment. For instance, 2D sheets of graphene,20,21 graphene
oxide (GO), and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)22,23 have
been reported to sense gas molecules and biomolecules.24 The interaction between DNA molecules and GO
was extensively, studied which has lead to the exploration of other
2D materials.14−17

Previous theoretical calculations
performed within the framework of local density approximations (LDAs)
have shown that binding energy of nucleobases on graphene follows
the order as G > A ≈ T ≈ C.21 Calculations performed with density functional theory (DFT) methods,
including van der Waals (vdW) interactions25,26 as
well as using a more accurate second order Møller–Plesset
perturbation theory (MP2)21 demonstrated
that the binding strength of nucleobases with graphene exhibits the
hierarchy as G > A > T > C. These findings are consistent
with the single solute adsorption isotherm study at the graphite–water
interface.1 Interaction of nucleobases
has also been studied intensively on hBN sheet,2,13,27 which was successfully fabricated through
a chemical solution-derived28 method and
microchemical cleavage method.29

The hBN shows a honeycomb lattice structure similar to that of graphene;
however, its electronic properties are entirely different from that
of graphene. Graphene is a semimetal with 0 eV band gap30 and having a nonpolar nature of C–C bond,
whereas hBN is an insulator (band gap ≈6 eV) with polar B–N
bond due to charge transfer from B to N atom owing to their different
electronegativities.31,32 Using LDA scheme, Lin et al.
studied the adsorption of nucleobases on hBN and concluded that nucleobases
bind to the hBN through polar electrostatic interaction, which manifests
that nucleobase–BN interaction is somewhat different from the
π–π interaction between nonpolar graphene and nucleobases.27 The hierarchy of the adsorption energy of nucleobase
molecules on hBN sheet found in this study was G > A > T >
C > U.

Recently, transition-metal dichalcogenides also received
considerable interest for the design of novel biosensors due to their
large surface area and outstanding electronic and optical properties.33,34 On the basis of photoluminescence measurements, Jin et al.34 showed that Au-modified MoS2 nanostructures
allow rapid and sensitive detection of DNA. Loan et al.35 designed graphene/MoS2 heterostructures
for label-free and selective detection of DNA by measuring the change
in peak intensity of photoluminescence. Huang et al.36 fabricated a microfluidic biosensor based on monolayer
MoS2 sheet for the ultrasensitive and visual detection
of DNA.

Understanding the interaction of nucleobases with nanomaterials
is important for the design of better sensors with high selectivity.
In this article, we report the adsorption of nucleobases on the hybrid
structure of graphene and hBN. The ternary boron–carbon–nitride
(BCN) alloy is a graphenelike nanostructure wherein some carbon atoms
are substituted by boron and nitrogen. These new hybrid structures
constitute an important material as their band gap can be tailored
by varying the atomic composition and atomic arrangement.37,38 Hybrid structures of graphene doped with nanodots of BN have been
synthesized experimentally.39,40 The effect of geometry
and position of nanodots on the structural, electronic, and magnetic
properties has been studied extensive using density functional theory.38,41,42 Recently, Chhetri et al. demonstrated
that BCN sheet show superior performance as a metal-free electrocatalyst
for hydrogen evolution reaction.43

Understanding the interaction between solid surfaces and biologically
active molecules, such as nucleic acid or proteins, is essential for
the preparation of biocompatible materials and biosensors.44 In addition, the self-assembly of DNA bases
on the inert surfaces has been hypothesized to play a crucial role
in the emergence of life under prebiotic conditions. Our findings
showed that BCN is a promising template for the self-assembly of nucleobases.27 Therefore, in this work, we report the binding
affinity of nucleobases with the BCN sheet. The paper is organized
as follows: in Computational Methodology,
we provide details of the methods used in this work. In Results and Discussion, we discuss the structural and thermodynamic
stability of BCN sheet by calculating its cohesive and formation energy.
Thereafter, we analyze the binding strength of nucleobases on BCN
sheet. To give further insight on the binding strength of nucleobases
with BCN, the electronic band structure of pristine and nucleobase-adsorbed
BCN sheets was also examined, followed by work function calculation.
We concluded the paper by giving a detailed summary of the main results
obtained and the future scope of boron–carbon–nitride
hybrid structures.

Results and Discussion
Structural and Thermodynamic Properties
The thermodynamic stability of the BCN sheet was assessed by calculating
its formation and cohesive energies. The formation energy (Ef) and cohesive energy (Ecoh) were calculated using eqs 1 and 2. It is important to note
that with this approach, the formation energy of pristine graphene
and hBN sheet is equal to zero, which provides us a reference value
to compare the formation energy of BCN sheet with these 2D structures.
The equations used to calculate Ecoh and Ef of BCN are given below. 1   2  where, in eq 1, nCC (=28) and nBN (=8) denote the CC and BN pairs in the BCN
sheet and μCC and μBN corresponds
to the chemical potential of C–C and B–N, respectively.
The chemical potentials C–C and B–N were obtained directly
from the infinite sheet energies of graphene and hBN. On the other
hand, in eq 2, Ei represents the gas-phase atomic energies of
C, B, and N. EBCN represents the total
energy of BCN. The formation and cohesive energies calculated for
BCN sheet are 0.21 and −7.4 eV, respectively. These results
indicate that BCN is thermodynamically stable. To compare the thermodynamic
stability of the BCN with graphene and hBN, we also calculated the
formation and cohesive energies for these systems. Our results indicate
that the stability of BCN lies midway between that of graphene and
hBN. The hierarchy in thermodynamic stability of the three systems
follows the order as graphene > BCN > hBN, as can be seen in Figure 1. The calculated
cohesive energies show a similar trend, as predicted by Özçelik
et al.45 Our results predict comparatively
smaller cohesive energies, which may be attributed to different functionals
(projector augmented wave), as employed in ref (50) and ours Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE). The chemical potential μCC and μBN obtained from graphene and BN sheet were −310.150
and −358.352 eV, respectively, which have been used in eq 1.

Figure 1 Cohesive energy of BCN sheet compared to that of graphene
and hBN.

The optimized structure
of BCN is shown in Figure SI2. Its optimized
dimensions in the plane were 14.760 × 14.760 Å2. The calculated C–C, C–N, C–B, and B–N
bond lengths were 1.423, 1.376, 1.476, and 1.455 Å. Optimized
structures of nucleobases in the gas phases are also shown in Figure SI2. From the figure, it can be seen that
the nucleobase molecules are terminated at the cut bond to the sugar
ring with a methyl group (CH3) to create an electronic
environment in the purine and pyrimidine bases more closely resembling
their situation in extended chains rather than that of just individual
isolated nucleobases by themselves.21 This
also has an advantage of creating a certain level of steric hindrance
during the interaction with the substrate.

Binding Energy
We start out this section by describing
the optimized structures of A, C, G, T, and U adsorbed on BCN using
PBE and PBE + vdW schemes. Since, in the previous theoretical studies,
it is reported that the nucleobases prefer to orient parallel on graphene
and hBN with AB-stacking owing to π–π interaction,27,46,47 in this work, we calculated the
binding energy of nucleobases on BCN sheet using AB-type stacking.
The optimized structures of nucleobases adsorbed on BCN sheet using
PBE + vdW are presented in Figure 2. From the optimized structures of nucleobases on BCN
with AB-stacking, we observed that the N atom of the nucleobase does
not align itself over the nitrogen atom of BCN due to electrostatic
repulsion. The AB-stacking structures of A, C, G, and T on BCN are
very similar to that of graphene and hBN.21,27Table 1 presents the vertical
distance between nucleobase molecules and BCN. We found that vertical
distances calculated using the PBE functional are comparatively larger
than those of PBE + vdW. For instance, the PBE and PBE + vdW distances
calculated for G on BCN were 3.789 and 3.467 Å, respectively.
A similar behavior was observed for other nucleobases also. It is
obvious that the calculated vertical distances are much larger than
the typical covalent bond lengths, which indicates that there could
not be any charge transfer between nucleobases and BCN. Moreover,
it is worth mentioning that we did not find any buckling in the BCN
or a tilt in the nucleobase molecules upon adsorption, which is a
clear indication of π–π interaction between nucleobases
and BCN.

a The energy is in eV, and distance, in

The binding energies of nucleobases calculated using
PBE and PBE + vdW schemes are also given in Table 1. It is observed that PBE + vdW gives more
binding than PBE due to dispersion correction in the former. The calculated
binding energies obtained using PBE + vdW (PBE) are −0.766
(−0.076), −0.750 (−0.078), −0.879 (−0.089),
−0.712 (−0.073), and −0.560 (−0.060) for
A, C, G, T, and U, respectively. We found that purine bases show comparatively
strong interaction to BCN than pyrimidine bases, which is due to the
presence of two aromatic rings in them. The pyrimidine base (U) has
least interaction as it contains only one ring and one side (−CH3) chain. On the other hand, pyrimidine bases (C and T) exhibit
intermediate interaction with the BCN because of the presence of two
side (−CH3/–NH2 in C and −CH3/–CH3 in T) chains. The differences in the
adsorption energies of nucleobases can also be explained on the basis
of vdW forces, which are directly proportional to the mass and size
of interacting species.47 In addition,
it is apparent that the calculated binding energies are comparatively
much larger than those of gas molecules physisorbed (0.01–1
eV per molecule) on a solid surface but less than the chemisorbed
energies (1–10 eV per molecule),27 which also shows that nucleobases are adsorbed on the BCN. The order
of binding strength of nucleobases on BCN sheet shows the trend as
G > A > T > C > U for PBE + vdW (G > A > T >
U > C for PBE). A similar order of binding energy for four nucleobases
(A, C, G, and T) on graphene and hBN were observed in previous theoretical
results.21,27 It is also important to note that the calculated
binding energies are comparatively larger than those calculated on
hBN ribbon47 (−0.433 to −0.624
eV), boron nitride nanotube (BNNT)2 (−0.29
to −0.42 eV), hBN sheet (−0.50 to −0.69 eV),27 and graphene21,26 (−0.512
to −0.73 eV). The binding energy is also in good agreement
with the results of Gowtham et al.21 who
employed MP2 perturbation theory to study the adsorption of nucleobases
on graphene. The comparatively larger binding energy obtained in the
present study is due to the Coulombic interactions that occur between
nucleobases and substrates owing to the different electronegativities
of boron and nitrogen besides π–π interactions.
Also, as DFT calculations are performed in gas phase and the interaction
energies may change in a more realistic environment such as water,
it is essential to compare the theoretical results with experimental
data. It is worth mentioning that our DFT results showed the same
trend of interaction of nucleobases with the BCN as experimental studies
have observed on graphene48 and crystalline
graphite1 in water. In addition, from Table 1, it is observed that
binding energies calculated using PBE are smaller as compared to PBE
+ vdW of about 1 order of magnitude. This shows that the physisorption
of nucleobases on BCN is mainly governed by vdW interactions. This
also demonstrates the necessity of including vdW forces for studying
nucleobase interactions with a surface.

Electronic Structure
Band structure calculations of nucleobase-adsorbed
BCN are important to analyze the binding mechanism of nucleobases
with the sheet. Table 2 shows the Fermi energy, highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO),
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, and band gap of
bare and nucleobase-adsorbed BCN. HOMO and LUMO energies and band
gaps of nucleobases are also shown in Table SI1. The calculated HOMO–LUMO gaps are comparatively smaller
for purine bases (2.766 eV for A and 2.499 eV for G) than pyrimidine
bases (3.013, 3.364, and 3.664 eV for C, T, and U, respectively).
The HOMO and LUMO energies lie in the range of −5.041 to −5.739
and −2.204 to −2.296 eV, respectively. This shows that
electrons in the nucleobases are tightly bound to their respective
molecules. The calculated band structures of bare and nucleobase-adsorbed
BCN are presented in Figure 3. It is well known that graphene has a 0 eV band gap and exhibits
a Dirac cone that arises as the conduction and valence bands touch
each other at the symmetry K-point of the Brillouin
zone (BZ). Furthermore, the experimentally measured band gap of hBN
is ≈6 eV.40 From the calculated
band structure, it can be clearly seen that the BCN sheet shows a
direct band gap that is also located at the Γ-point of the Brillouin
zone. The calculated band gap of bare BCN is 0.659 eV, which is significantly
less than that of hBN but greater than that of graphene. These results
shows that the ternary alloy of boron, carbon, and nitrogen may have
potential applications in electronics as it show a suitable direct
band gap.

In addition, it is important to mention that a band
gap can be opened in graphene by introducing differently sized nanodomains
in the graphene.41 This indicates that
by changing the composition of constituent elements in BCN, its band
gap can be tailored for specific applications. Similarly, the band
gap of hBN can be tuned by incorporating graphene nanodomains in it.
In a recent study, Ba et al. experimentally synthesized these kinds
of sheets wherein they cut down the band gap of hBN to ≈2 eV,
which is about one-third of the band gap of pristine hBN.40

Now, considering the band structure of
nucleobase-adsorbed BCN, we found that nucleobases have a negligibly
small effect on the band gap of BCN, as can be seen from Table 2. The maximum change
observed in the band gap of nucleobase-adsorbed BCN is 4 meV. These
results clearly show that the fundamental properties (e.g., electronic
structure and geometry) of BCN and nucleobases in the adsorbed state
remain unaltered, which indicates that BCN is a potential candidate
for the self-assembly of nucleobases and should be further explored
for biological applications.

Work
Function
To further understand the interaction of nucleobases
with the BCN sheet, we calculated the work function (Φ) of bare
and nucleobase-adsorbed BCN. Φ was calculated using eq 3 and is defined as the
energy required for removing an electron from the Fermi level to the
vacuum. 3  where Evac represents the vacuum potential
and EF is the Fermi energy. The values
of Φ calculated for bare and nucleobase-adsorbed BCN are 3.792
eV, 3.879 eV (A), 3.868 eV (C), 3.841 eV (G), 3.766 eV (T), and 3.812
eV (U). Plots of the work function are shown in Figure 4. The small dip in the work function corresponds
to the position of nucleobases, whereas the larger dip is associated
with the BCN sheet. We observe that upon adsorption, the work function
of nucleobase-adsorbed BCN changes relative to the value of pristine
BCN (3.792 eV) by 0.087, 0.076, 0.049, −0.026, and 0.020 eV
for A, C, G, T, and U, respectively. These results show that work
function of BCN changes distinctly upon adsorption of nucleobases,
which shows the possibility of tuning the work function of substrate
materials. The small changes in the work function also signify the
physisorption of nucleobases on BCN. Also, due to the shift in the
work function, there will be a small rearrangement in charge at the
nucleobase–substrate interface. This rearrangement of charges
produces an interfacial dipole moment, which can be related to the
shift in work function ΔΦ. This work function shift, in
turn, can be related with the change in the induced dipole moment
(Δp) using a simple electrostatic relation49 ΔΦ = eΔp/ϵ0A, where A is the area of the cell used in the calculation. Employing this
equation, we calculated Δp for adsorbed A,
C, G, T, and U on BCN as 0.105, 0.091, 0.059, −0.031, and 0.024
e Å. It should be noted here that Δp represents
the normal component of the induced dipole moment directed from nucelobases
to the substrate (Δp > 0) and the substrate
to nucleobases (Δp < 0). On this basis,
it can be said that although the nucleobases are physisorbed on BCN,
which is mainly caused by vdW interactions, an interfacial dipole
is induced upon adsorption to produce a shift in the work function.

Conclusions
We performed
ab initio calculations to study the thermodynamic stability and electronic
structure of BCN ternary alloy and examined their interaction with
nucleobases. Our calculations show that BCN is a thermodynamically
stable material. Also, all five nucleobases were found to exhibit
physical adsorption on the BCN, which is attributed to the π–π
interaction and their different molecular structures. Our results
showed that the adsorption energy of nucleobases on BCN follows the
order G > A > T > C > U. The adsorption energies calculated
on BCN were found superior to graphene, hBN, and BNNT. Additionally,
it is found that the interaction between nucleobases and BCN does
not change their fundamental properties. On the other hand, nucleobases
were found to significantly change the work function of BCN sheet
due to charge rearrangement at the substrate–nucleobase interface.
Thus, it can be concluded that BCN may act as a superior candidate
for sensing applications and the self-assembly of nucleobases compared
with graphene, hBN, and BNNT.

Computational
Methodology
DFT calculations were performed to study the
adsorption energies and structural properties of bare and composite
systems. The ground-state calculations were carried out using the
Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within generalized
gradient approximation.50 Ultrasoft pseudopotentials
were generated using the Rappe–Rabe–Kaxiras–Joannopoulos
method.51 A kinetic energy cutoff of 40
Ry was employed for plane wave basis set and 400 Ry for charge density.
The Brillouin zone (BZ) integration was done using a uniform Monkhorst–Pack52k-mesh of 3 × 3 ×
1 point for relaxation calculations and 10 × 10 × 1 for
electronic structure calculations. Both kinetic energy cutoff and k-mesh were found sufficient to satisfy convergence criteria
(Figure SI1). We used a 6 × 6 ×
1 unit cell consisting of 72 atoms in total, out of which 56 are carbon
and 8 each are boron and nitrogen (making approx a ternary alloy consisting
of B0.1C0.8N0.1). To avoid the interaction
between periodic images, a large vacuum of 20 Å was employed
in a direction perpendicular to the sheet. It has been reported in
the previous theoretical studies21 that
vdW interaction is the predominant source of attraction between nucleobases
and adsorbent. Therefore, it is important to include the vdW interactions
in DFT calculations to accurately determine the adsorption energies.
Thus, in the present work, we have used dispersion correction of Grimme’s
D3-type for DFT calculations (DFT-D3)53 (for more detail about DFT-D3, see the SI) to study the interactions of nucleobases with BCN sheet.

The adsorption energy (Ead) of nucleobases
on BCN sheet was calculated using the following equation 4  where EBCN+nucleobase is the total energy of the BCN with nucleobase, EBCN represents the total energy of bare BCN, and Enucleobase denotes the energy of the nucleobase.
All calculations were carried out using QUANTUM ESPRESSO package.54
