Serious
infections caused by bacteria that are resistant to commonly
used antibiotics have become a major global healthcare problem in
the 21st century. Multidrug-resistant bacteria causing severe infections
mainly grow in complex bacterial communities known as biofilms, in
which bacterial resistance to antibacterial agents and to the host
immune system is strengthened. As drug resistance is becoming a threatening
problem, it is necessary to develop new antimicrobial agents with
novel mechanisms of action. Here, we designed and synthesized a small
library of N-substituted hydroxylamine (N-HA) compounds
with antibacterial activity. These compounds, acting as radical scavengers,
inhibit the bacterial ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme. RNR enzyme
is essential for bacterial proliferation during infection, as it provides
the building blocks for DNA synthesis and repair. We demonstrate the
broad antimicrobial effect of several drug candidates against a variety
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, together with low toxicity
toward eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, the most promising compounds
can reduce the biomass of an established biofilm on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus
aureus, and Escherichia coli. This study settles the starting point to develop new N-hydroxylamine compounds as potential effective antibacterial agents
to fight against drug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.

==== Body
Introduction
Ever since antibiotics
were introduced worldwide, bacterial pathogens
have been developing resistance, which reduces drastically or eliminates
their effectiveness. The emergence of drug-resistant bacteria is a
growing challenge to anti-infective therapy. Worldwide bacteria species
that have acquired multiple drug resistance and escaped the effects
from our current antimicrobial drugs include different important bacterial
pathogens.1 Several bacterial pathogens
such as methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA and VRSA) or multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to almost all
clinically available antibacterial drugs.2 Moreover, recent estimates suggest that bacterial biofilms account
for over 80% of microbial infections in the human body.3,4 Bacterial biofilms are dense aggregates of cell–cell surface-attached
microorganisms encased in a self-synthesized hydrated extracellular
polymeric substances matrix.5 Bacterial
pathogens living in biofilms are hard to eradicate because of different
strategies that involve restricted penetration of antimicrobials,
resistance to the immune system, differential physiological activity
with slow metabolism, the presence of phenotypic variants and persisters,
efflux systems, and enhanced repair systems.6,7

The lack of new antibiotics in the drug development pipeline, especially
those with new modes of action and active against bacteria, worsens
the situation. In this context, the search of new antimicrobials acting
on new targets is a critical challenge. Searching for new compounds
or strategies to decrease bacterial biofilm formation and avoid antibiotic
resistance is a critical stage essential for the treatment of biofilm-associated
diseases.8

Ribonucleotide reductase
(RNR) enzyme has shown to be an antimicrobial
drug target for the treatment of several infections.9 RNR exclusively supplies the nucleotide precursors for
DNA synthesis and repair by catalyzing the reduction of ribonucleotides
(NTPs) to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) via radical
chemistry. Modulation of RNR activity is a rate-limiting step in DNA
synthesis. Therefore, inactivation of RNR activity ceases DNA synthesis
and, consequently, inhibits cell proliferation. Thus, RNR is essential
for all bacteria causing both acute and biofilm infection, as they
need to multiply and replicate its genome within the host and, therefore,
need a constant supply of the four different dNTPs for the synthesis
of the new DNA.

Up to date, three different main RNR classes
are described (class
I, II, and III), differing in their cofactor requirements and quaternary
structures.9−12 Class I RNR is additionally subdivided into class Ia, class Ib,
and class Ic, depending on the metal type of the metallocofactor of
the enzyme. Class I RNRs are tetrameric (α2β2) enzymes, composed of two homodimeric proteins: R1 (α2), which contains the catalytic domain (active site) and the
complex allosteric domain (responsible for the regulation of the enzyme),
and R2 (β2), which carries a stable tyrosyl radical
and an oxygen-linked diiron center required for free-radical production.
Once the radical has been generated, an electron transfer takes place
between β2 and α2 subunits to catalyze
the reduction of NTPs to their corresponding dNTPs.

Although
both bacteria and eukaryotic cells codify for RNR, there
are remarkable differences between them, as the sequence similarity
between them is quite low,13 and hence,
specific inhibitors can potentially be designed to differentially
target bacterial RNRs. In addition, eukaryotic cells only encode for
one RNR class (class Ia), whereas bacterial species can encode simultaneously
for different RNR classes, thus making bacterial RNR system an attractive
target for antibacterial therapies.

Numerous and diverse RNR
inhibitors have been described during
the last decades, including different inhibitor families such as free-radical
scavengers, iron chelators, and substrate analogues, among others.14−18 Radical scavenger compounds are well known to inhibit RNR by quenching
an essential tyrosyl free radical, located in the small class I subunit,19,20 which is required to generate the reduction power in the catalytic
subunit of the enzyme. Several radical scavenger molecules, such as
hydroxyurea (HU), didox, trimidox, and hydroxyguanidine, have been
shown to be useful for the treatment of different cancer diseases.16 One of these compounds, hydroxyurea, was used
for general cancer treatment and is commonly used nowadays for the
treatment of some specific ones.21,22 Although these
compounds inhibit bacterial replication inhibiting bacterial RNR,
they cannot be used to treat bacterial infections because of the high
toxicity toward eukaryotic cells. Recently, we have identified “NH–OH”
moiety as an important radical scavenger family by itself. N-Methylhydroxylamine (M-HA) is a compound with a high capacity
to specifically inhibit the Bacillus anthracis RNR without interfering the activity of eukaryotic RNR, thus being
nontoxic.19,20 We have also proven the antibacterial capacity
of this radical scavenger on Pseudomonas and Mycobacterium infections.23 This
discovery opens new horizons in the development, identification, and
investigation of the use of N-substituted hydroxylamine
(N-HA) compounds as specific antimicrobial RNR inhibitors.

Results
Design
and Synthesis of the N-HA Library
We previously
described the antibacterial activity of M-HA, a radical scavenger
compound that specifically targets bacterial RNR without interfering
the host enzyme.19,23 It is known that low-molecular-weight
compounds, such as M-HA, might have effects on structurally unrelated
proteins. For this reason, we designed and synthesized a small library
of N-HA compounds with different structures to better cover the chemical
space and gain more selectivity (Figure 1) to directly target the bacterial class
I RNR enzyme (class Ia and class Ib), acting as an antibacterial agent.

Figure 1 Library
of N-HAs. Chemical structures of the N-HA compounds, designed
to target the bacterial RNR enzyme, are shown. The synthesis yield
obtained for each compound is shown in %, with the exception of the
compounds acquired commercially. Log P values of
representative candidates are indicated.

The N-HA library was generated to identify novel drugs with
high
free-radical scavenging (FRS) activity against RNR enzymes. As the
FRS activity is based on the ability of the molecule to donate a hydrogen
ion to a free radical, FRS activity of N-HAs will depend on the homolytic
bond dissociation enthalpies (BDEs) of the O–H bond of hydroxylamines.
It has been predicted by computational methods that the resonance
and the inductive effects are important in the BDEs of the O–H
bond of N-monosubstituted hydroxylamines. Thus, the
design of N-HA with electron-donating inductive effects and resonance
effects makes the corresponding N-oxyl species more
electron-rich and more stable radicals, leading to a BDE decrease24,25 and thus resulting in a higher FRS activity. Otherwise, the presence
of electron-withdrawing groups or no resonance effects will generate
an opposite effect, destabilizing the produced radicals, increasing
BDE, and consequently, decreasing FRS activity.

The synthesis
of N-HA products was accomplished by reductive amination
of aldehydes, as described before26 with
some variations, by a general one-pot synthesis that involves the
conversion of a carbonyl group to the hydroxylamine via the corresponding N-hydroxyimine (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 General Synthetic Scheme for the Synthesis of the N-Hydroxylamine Compounds
Initially, N-alkyl hydroxylamine isomers
of four
carbon atoms, including a secondary hydroxylamine and additional analogues,
increasing the alkyl chain length to increase the electron-donating
inductive effect to stabilize the generated radical, were synthesized
or purchased (1–6). Moreover, N-cycloalkyl hydroxylamine derivatives were incorporated
to the library (7 and 8) to elucidate the
importance of linear and cyclic aliphatic structures in the stabilization
of hydroxylamine’s radicals. Replacement of the aliphatic moiety
in N-hydroxylamine compounds by an aromatic ring,
such as benzyl or homobenzyl group, was also explored to increase
FRS activity due to delocalization of the free radical throughout
the aromatic ring structure (9 and 10).
To further study if radical stabilization by resonance effects can
be affected by inductive effects, N-hydroxylamine
compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents in the aromatic ring,
such as fluorine and trifluoromethyl (11–15), were synthesized. In addition, the library was further
extended with a series of N-hydroxylamine compounds
with electron-donating substituents in the aromatic ring, such as
methyl and methoxy (16–19). Finally, N-hydroxylamines containing a heteroaryl group or being
part of the heterocycle as secondary hydroxylamines were also synthesized
or purchased, respectively (20–22), to study the ability of heteroaromatics in stabilizing N-oxyl species.

Identification of New N-Hydroxylamines
(N-HAs)
with Antimicrobial Activity against Both Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative
Bacteria
In the antibacterial activity screening of the newly
synthesized N-HAs, compounds were tested against four Gram-positive
(B. anthracis, Staph.
aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis) and two
Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) clinically relevant bacterial strains,
and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined
(Table 1). As a reference,
an importantly used antibiotic, ciprofloxacin (CIP), was also tested.
As shown in Table 1, we also included the M-HA and HU antibacterial and cytotoxicity
values to compare them with the new data.

(MIC50 > 250). Cytotoxicity values in murine macrophages
measured after 24 h are indicated (CC50) as well as their
SI (in parenthesis next to the MIC50 value). Selectivity
indexes of ≥5 are in bold. Compounds with MIC50 values
over 1000 μg/mL in all the strains are not shown (1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 22).

Some of the compounds (1–5, 7, 9, 13, 16, and 19–22) showed
no antibacterial activity
in any bacteria tested (MIC50 > 1000 μg/mL) (data
not shown). In general, Gram-positive bacteria species (encoding class
Ib RNR) were more sensitive to 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17, and 18. In particular, compounds 11 and 17 with an MIC50 value of <15 μg/mL showed higher
activity compared to M-HA against B. anthracis. Compounds 11 and 15 showed also high
antimicrobial activity against both Staph. aureus and Staph. epidermidis with an MIC50 value of <60 μg/mL compared to M-HA and HU. Compound 18 also showed antibacterial activity against Staph. epidermidis with an MIC50 value
of <40 μg/mL. Compounds 14 and 17 showed antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis with an MIC50 value of <80 μg/mL.

Gram-negative
bacterial species exhibited high resistance to most
of the compounds. Compound 8, showing values similar
to M-HA, was the most active, highly inhibiting the growth of P. aeruginosa with an MIC50 value lower
than 17 μg/mL and that of E. coli with an MIC50 value lower than 60 μg/mL. Compound 12 also resulted in high antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC50 < 70 μg/mL),
and compound 15 was also effective against E. coli (MIC50 < 60 μg/mL).

None of the N-hydroxylamine derivatives
containing
linear alkyl groups with less than six carbon atoms were active against
any bacterial species tested, despite the fact that M-HA is active
with one carbon atom.

These results indicate that inductive
effects generated by linear
alkyl groups with less than six carbon atoms are insufficient to stabilize N-oxyl species, except for the case of M-HA. Compound 6, a linear aliphatic N-hydroxylamine with
six carbon atoms, and compound 8, a cyclic aliphatic
hydroxylamine with seven atom carbons, exhibited antimicrobial activity
against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. N-Homobenzylhydroxylamine (10) and some N-benzylhydroxylamine analogues with substituents in the
aromatic ring (11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18) exhibited higher
antimicrobial activity compared to the aliphatic N-hydroxylamines. These results might indicate that conjugate rings
lead to stable spin delocalized systems, providing stabilizing effects
for N-oxyl species radicals generated by reduction
of the tyrosyl radical of the RNR enzyme. This fact highlights the
importance of the resonance effects compared to the inductive effects
in the stabilization of radicals. Furthermore, the effect of the delocalization
of the free radical throughout the aromatic ring structure overlaps
the inductive effect generated by substituents in the aromatic ring. N-Hydroxylamine derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents
and/or electron-donating substituents in the aromatic ring were active
against several bacterial species with no distinction. N-Hydroxylamines containing a heteroaryl group or being part of the
heterocycle as secondary hydroxylamines showed no antibacterial activity
in any bacteria tested. However, N-benzylhydroxylamine
analogues (9, 13, 16, and 19) showed no antibacterial activity and clearly demonstrate
a challenge to capture a structure–activity relationship. We
believe that radical scavenger molecules could interact in different
places along the protein electron chain transfer pathway from the
β2 to the α2 subunits, and this
explains why radical scavengers without a common scaffold are active.

Selected N-HA Compounds Exhibit Low Cytotoxicity and Good Lipophilicity
Indexes
To validate hydroxylamine compounds to be used as
drug candidates, eukaryotic cytotoxicity of the compounds showing
higher activity against bacterial species (6, 8, 10–12, 14, 15, 17, and 18) was determined in
murine macrophages (see Experimental Section) as described in our previous work.23 Compounds with no antibacterial activity in the initial screening
were discarded.

The 50% cytotoxic inhibitory concentration (CC50) values were determined from dose–response data obtained
from the toxicity assay of macrophages. Therapeutic indexes (selectivity
index, SI), defined as SI = CC50/MIC50, were
calculated (see Table 1) to measure drug safety (SI > 10). Compounds with high CC50 and low MIC50 have higher therapeutic index and
are safer
compared to compounds with low SI values.

Compounds 11, 15, 17, and 18 showed higher
SI in Gram-positive bacteria: in the case
of B. anthracis, SI values of 21.3,
21.2, 45.2, and 45, respectively, and in Staph. aureus, SI values of 5.3 and 11.4 for compounds 11 and 15, respectively. Compounds 11, 15, and 18 showed SI values of 10.6, 11.4, and 10.4 in Staph. epidermidis, respectively. For Gram-negative
bacteria, the best SI values were achieved with compound 8 in the case of P. aeruginosa (SI
= 10.5) and compound 15 in the case of E. coli (SI = 11.4). Although compound 12 was active against P. aeruginosa,
SI index was lower due to a lower CC50 value. Still, further
studies were carried with this compound to have more active N-HA compounds
analyzed in the case of Gram-negative bacteria. Clearly, some of the
compounds improve the SI values of the HU and M-HA compounds previously
analyzed, especially against Gram-positive bacteria.

To further
test N-hydroxylamine compounds as drug
candidates, the lipophilicity of representative N-HA candidates (8, 10, and 12–15) was measured by calculating the n-octanol–water
partition coefficients in their logarithmic form (log P) (Figure 1). The
majority of the N-hydroxylamine analogues exhibited
a moderate lipophilicity (log P between 0 and 3),
indicating a good balance between solubility and permeability, which
is optimal for oral absorption and cell membrane permeation through
passive transport.

N-HA Compounds Inhibit Bacterial Growth through
their Radical
Scavenging Activity in Bacterial RNR
To confirm that novel N-hydroxylamines inhibit bacterial growth by inhibiting
radical formation in bacterial RNR, the FRS activities of compounds
showing antibacterial activity (6, 8, 10–12, 14, 15, 17, and 18) were evaluated through a
radical scavenging assay by trapping the DPPH· radical as previously
described27 (see Experimental
Section). Ascorbic acid (AA), HU, and M-HA were used as positive
radical scavenger controls (Table 2). After 8 h of incubation and using a DPPH· concentration
of 70 μM, compounds 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18 were able to scavenge the DPPH· radical
with IC50 values of 9.3, 14.3, 6.4, 4.2, 23.1, 8.1, 4.8,
and 6.5 μM, respectively, showing similar scavenging activity
as AA (IC50 =10.2 μM), HU (IC50 = 8.6
μM), and M-HA (IC50 = 20.3 μM). Similar values
were obtained at 12 h incubation time. However, compounds 2, 3, and 6, with linear aliphatic N-HA
with antibacterial activity, displayed a low FRS activity compared
to cyclic aliphatic hydroxylamine (8), N-homobenzylhydroxylamine (10), and N-benzylhydroxylamine analogues (11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18)
with IC50 values higher than 140 μM. This study indicates
that cyclic aliphatic rings and aromatic rings make corresponding N-oxyl species more electron-rich and more stable radicals,
leading to a BDE decrease and thus resulting in a higher FRS activity,
as we previously discussed. Also, our data supports the view that
these compounds exhibit a similar capacity to scavenge RNR generated
radical as other well-known RNR radical inhibitors such as HU and
M-HA do (see Table 2).

a Radical scavenging
capacity was
evaluated by measuring the reduction of the free radical DPPH·
spectrophotometrically after incubating each compound with the DPPH
during 8 and 12 h. AA, HU, and M-HA were used as positive controls.

To evaluate the specific inhibitory
effect of the N-HA compounds
in bacterial RNR, P. aeruginosa purine
deoxyribonucleotide levels were quantified at exponential phase in
the presence of N-HA compounds (8 and 12) and HU (positive control) at 5 mM for 3 h and in the absence of
or any added compound (negative control) (Figure 2A). Relative dNTP levels were quantified
in the different extracts carrying out the diphenylamine (DPA) assay.28,29 The results showed a significant decrease of dNTP levels when P. aeruginosa was treated with compounds 8 and 12 (7.45% and 67.50% reduction, respectively) compared
to negative control. HU, used as the positive control, also showed
a reduction of 65.45% in dNTP levels.

Figure 2 Inhibition of bacterial RNR by N-HA compounds.
(A) In vivo inhibition
of bacterial RNR in P. aeruginosa was
determined by using DPA assay to estimate dNTP levels. Relative dNTP
levels were measured in protein extracts from mid-exponential cultures
incubated with or without 5 mM of the radical scavengers 8, 12, or HU (positive control) for 3 h. Percentage of
produced dNTPs is shown for each sample using untreated culture as
a reference. The results shown represent the mean ± SD of two
replicates of one representative experiment. An unpaired t test, compared to the untreated sample, was performed to evaluate
significant differences (*, P < 0.05). (B). Western
blot analysis of class Ia RNR (NrdA) of bacteria at mid-exponential
phase cultured in the presence of 5 mM of 8, 12, or HU for 3 h. The Western blot is representative of two independent
experiments.

The role of the radical
scavenger HU in the inhibition of RNR has
been well studied. As many other enzymatic inhibitors, when using
HU, there is an induction of the expression of the inhibited enzyme
(RNR), as it has been previously well described for us and many other
authors.29,30

The induction of the expression of P. aeruginosa PAO1 class Ia RNR (NrdA) was studied
in the presence of the most
active N-HA radical scavengers against P. aeruginosa, using HU as a positive control. A Western blot was performed using
protein extracts from PAO1 cultures in which HU, 8, or 12 was added (at initial exponential phase and left for 3
h). As shown, both 8 and 12 were able to
induce NrdA expression (1.6 and 3 times more, respectively) compared
to the negative control, which was left without adding any compound.
Compounds 8 and 12 had similar effects on
NrdA expression to the ones HU shows (nine times of induction), showing
the direct effect of the newly synthesized N-HA compounds on bacterial
RNR expression (Figure 2B).

N-HA Compounds Display Antibacterial Activity through a Bacteriostatic
Mode of Action
To better understand how the most active N-hydroxylamines affect the viability of bacterial cells
in terms of physiological changes, bacterial cells were imaged through
fluorescence microscopy using the Live/Dead viability assay (see Experimental Section), which allows measuring bacterial
viability in terms of membrane integrity. SYTO 9 green fluorescent
nucleic acid dye is able to penetrate all membrane cells, labeling
all bacteria, whereas propidium iodide can only enter bacteria cells
with damaged membrane.

Staph. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E.
coli, and B. anthracis growing cultures at early exponential phase were incubated with
selected N-HA compounds showing greater antibacterial action for 2
h then subsequently stained and imaged using fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 3). Images
of bacteria also treated with antibiotics novobiocin (NVB) and CIP
were taken to compare the effects with known antibiotics. N-HA compounds
did not affect membrane integrity of the cells, as no differences
were observed in the ratio of green cells (viable) and red cells (nonviable)
with or without any of the treatments demonstrating a bacteriostatic
property of these compounds. The same effect was previously described
for other radical scavengers such as HU, hydroxylamine, and M-HA.23

Figure 3 Bacterial viability after different compound treatments.
Bacterial
cultures were visualized under fluorescence microscopy after 2 h exposition
with the different N-HAs at 1× MIC concentration. Images were
taken at 100×. Scale bars shown represent a real distance of
20 μm. Live cells were green (SYTO 9 dye), and dead cells were
red (propidium iodide dye). CIP and NVB (50 μg/mL) were used.

N-HA Compounds Show Antibiofilm
Activity against Different Pathogens
Because most of the
bacterial infections in humans are in biofilm
form,3,31 it is crucial to study the antibacterial
activity under the growth condition in which bacteria are found naturally
more resistant to the action of antimicrobials.7,31 The
most promising compounds showing higher antibacterial activity, together
with low cytotoxicity (highest SI values), were evaluated on P. aeruginosa, Staph. aureus, and E. coli static biofilms.

P. aeruginosa, Staph.
aureus, and E. coli bacterial biofilms (72 h old) were established and treated with
repeated administration of selected compounds (one dose/24 h for three
consecutive days), and biofilm biomass was evaluated (Figure 4). CIP, a commonly used and
known antibiotic, was used as a positive control.

Figure 4 P. aeruginosa, Staph.
aureus, and E. coli biofilms are inhibited by adding different concentrations of radical
scavengers 8, 11, 12, and 15. Bacteria were allowed to grow as biofilms in pegs (in
the case of P. aeruginosa) or in wells
(in the case of Staph. aureus and E. coli) for 72 h using 96 well microplates (see Experimental Section). Then, the medium was removed,
and fresh medium with different concentrations of radical scavenger
compounds were changed every 24 h over 3 days (24 h, 48 h, and 72
h). The percentage of biofilm biomass was calculated by normalizing
the data for each of the nontreated biofilms for each day. The results
shown are the means ± SD of four-six replicates from one representative
of two independent experiments. A Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test was performed to detect significant differences. A Student’s t test was performed (*, P < 0.05; vs
nontreated biofilms). The viable counts at control experiments without
a compound were 2.1 × 109 ± 2.8 × 108 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL for PAO1, 9.8 × 109 ± 3.1 × 108 cfu/mL for Staph. aureus, and 3.3 × 1010 ±
1.8 × 109 cfu/mL for E. coli.

In the case of P. aeruginosa (Figure 4A), compound 8 clearly reduced drastically
the preestablished biofilm in
more than 95% in P. aeruginosa at 48
h of treatment with an MIC concentration of 16 μg/mL. Not so
effective, compound 12 reduced above 55% of the established
biofilm after 72 h of treatment using the highest concentrations.
CIP (0.5 μg/mL), used as the positive control, reduced the preestablished
biofilm in more than 85%. Compound 8 showed higher activity
compared to CIP, demonstrating a good antibacterial activity to eliminate P. aeruginosa biofilms.

Not so notorious but
also important, compounds 11 and 15, at
MIC concentration, efficiently reduced Staph. aureus biofilm at levels around 50% after
72 h of treatment (Figure 4B), with similar levels to those reached when treating with
CIP (around 60% reduction).

In the case of E.
coli biofilms,
compound 15 also successfully removed static preestablished
biofilm at more than 50% at 72 h with the highest concentration (2×
MIC concentration) (Figure 4C), displaying low antibiofilm activity compared to CIP. CIP-treated
biofilm control (0.25 μg/mL) showed a reduction of more than
90% formed biofilm.

To test some of the compounds under more
natural conditions that
better resemble the in vivo infections, P. aeruginosa continuous-flow biofilms were treated with two of the most effective
compounds (8 and 12) and CIP (positive control)
(Figure 5A) and observed
by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) demonstrating the capacity
of these compounds to decrease biofilm biomass and thickness. Note
that under this grown condition, the biofilm is extremely resistant
to all known antibiotics (with CIP, the formed biofilm is only reduced
around 50%).3

and subjected to a continuous supply of fresh medium at a flow rate
of 3 mL/h. Different concentrations of compounds 8 and 12 and CIP were then used to treat biofilms for 24 h. Afterward,
biofilms were dyed with SYTO 9 and propidium iodide, rinsed, and imaged
with CLSM. (A) ImageJ-analyzed CLSM

the Z-projections and the corresponding orthogonal

dead cells (damaged membrane). (B) Quantitative flow cell biofilm
parameters (biomass and average thickness) of the biofilms, quantified

(*, P < 0.05, vs nontreated biofilms).

P. aeruginosa flow
biofilms grew
in a characteristic pattern with a lawn of bacterial growth on the
surface. These results showed that compounds 8 and 12 at MIC concentration clearly disrupted and inhibited P. aeruginosa flow biofilms. Control experiments
using CIP showed that a characterized bacterial biofilm decreased,
as previously described.32 When analyzed
using COMSTAT software, P. aeruginosa biofilms showed significant structural differences in the presence
of both compounds (Figure 5B). Biomass and average thickness decreased in biofilms grown
in the presence of 8 (more than 50%) and 12 (more than 30%), indicating the ability of these new radical scavengers
to remove preexisting P. aeruginosa growing in flow biofilms with similar results as compared to the
benchmarked antibiotic (CIP).

Discussion
Because
of the essential role of RNR in cellular replication, it
has been studied for a long time as an antibacterial target, and different
RNR inhibitors have been used as antiproliferative therapies in cancer
diseases.14,15,17 This is the
case of HU, a molecule with a hydroxylamine moiety that avoids RNR
activity by trapping a radical generated in the activator subunit
of the enzyme that is needed to initiate the catalysis.

As there
is low similarity between some pathogenic bacteria and
the host RNR enzymes,19 it is possible
to specifically target bacterial enzyme without interfering eukaryotic
cells and avoiding host toxicity. In this sense, methyl hydroxylamine,
another radical scavenger compound with a hydroxylamine moiety, as
HU, was found to show antibacterial activity against both P. aeruginosa and Mycobacterium bovis BCG without reducing eukaryotic viability.19,20,23 This finding settled the point for the design
and development of new radical scavengers with improved antibacterial
activity that act against antibiotic multiresistant bacteria.

In previous studies, the direct radical scavenging of the RNR tyrosyl
radical in the enzyme was demonstrated to take place when using HU,
hydroxylamine, and methylhydroxylamine.20,23

Here,
we designed and synthesized a small-molecule library of 16
N-HAs, incorporating six other molecules that were acquired commercially
(Figure 1). As the
design of the new N-HA chemical structures was based on a common N-hydroxylamine moiety as the functional group involved
in the radical scavenging, we hypothesized the same mode of action
for our new N-HA compounds in RNR inhibition. As expected, we could
prove the radical scavenging activity of different active N-HAs by
measuring the reduction of the free radical DPPH spectrophotometrically,
showing the ability of these compounds to quench free radicals as
positive controls, such as AA, HU, and M-HA, do (see Table 2). Moreover, we demonstrated
the effect of two of the N-HAs in reducing the intracellular dNTP
levels and inducing the protein expression of P. aeruginosa class I RNR, as HU does29,33,34 (Figure 2), making
evident the clear role of these compounds in the inhibition of bacterial
RNR enzyme.

Antibacterial activity was assessed for all the
library compounds.
Although some of the compounds exhibited no antibacterial activity,
nine of the new N-HAs were able to inhibit the growth of different
bacterial pathogens, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria
(see Table 1).

The library was composed of a wide diversity of structures, including
aliphatic and aromatic substituents, to better cover the chemical
space and gain selectivity toward the RNR enzyme. As theoretically
expected, some of the molecules with cyclic aliphatic groups and aromatic
groups showed better activity against bacteria than the ones with
linear aliphatic groups, as it has been well described that radical
scavenging activities are related to aromatic structures as phenolic
compounds.17,35 To a great extent, N-benzylhydroxylamines with substituents in the aromatic ring (10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18) were the ones with
higher activity against Gram-positive bacterial strains. This statement
is also consistent with the fact that lower radical scavenger activity
is shown in N-HAs with aliphatic substituents, such as 2, 3, and 6, which displayed an IC50 at least 13 times higher than the other evaluated compounds (Table 2). This is probably
due to the fact that electron delocalization in the aromatic ring
favors the stabilization of the free radical, thus providing higher
FRS activity. However, other N-benzylhydroxylamine
analogues (9, 13, 16, and 19) showed no antibacterial activity, highlighting a lack
of structure–activity relationship. We assume that N-HA molecules
could quench the free radical in different places along the protein
electron chain transfer.

Overall, N-HAs resulted in higher antibacterial
activity against
Gram-positive species rather than Gram-negative species, excluding 8, which showed high activity against both Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria. It is clear that some of the new N-HA compounds
(8, 11, 15, 17, and 18) result in higher antimicrobial activity and
SI compared to the HU and M-HA. Gram-positive bacteria studied here
(B. anthracis, Staph.
aureus, Staph. epidermidis, and E. faecalis) encode for a specific
class Ib RNR, whereas Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) specifically encode
for a class Ia RNR. Particularly, E. coli also encodes for an additional class Ib RNR, although it is not
expressed under LB growing conditions.36 This difference in RNR subclass is possibly the explanation of such
preference for Gram-positive RNR enzymes. We previously described
that M-HA showed better specific RNR inhibition for class Ib RNR,19 thus demonstrating better antimicrobial activity
in bacteria expressing the class Ib RNR subclass.23

How can such a diversity of molecule structures inhibit
RNR enzymes?
More specifically, where does the radical scavenging of such molecules
take place? Class I RNR enzymes are made up of two homodimeric subunits
(α2β2): the large α2 homodimeric subunit called NrdA (class Ia) or NrdE (class Ib) and
the small β2 subunit called NrdB (class Ia) or NrdF
(class Ib). The large subunit (α2) is the catalytic
subunit, which harbors the substrate binding site and reduces the
different nucleotides to their corresponding dNTPs, whereas the small
β2 subunit contains an oxygen-linked diferric or
dimanganese metal center that generates a free tyrosyl radical. Once
the radical is generated, an electron transfer takes place between
β2 and α2 subunits from the specific
radical site in the small subunit to the substrate binding site in
the large subunit by a mechanism involving a long-range electron transfer
pathway.11,12

Docking experiments with other well-known
radical scavenger molecules,
HU and p-allyloxyphenol, evidently indicate that
the molecule binding site is not well defined and that in most of
the cases, radical scavengers are located at the protein surface.35 These experiments point out that the large p-allyloxyphenol molecule cannot access the tyrosyl radical
site directly for structural reasons so that, for these inhibitors,
the radical scavenging action needs to be performed during the long-range
electron transfer pathway.35 Molecules
synthesized in this work have similar chemical structures and molecular
weights to p-allyloxyphenol, so we hypothesize the
same radical scavenger activity for the different N-HA molecules described
in this work as compared to the p-allyloxyphenol.
Probably, our N-HA molecules are not able to diffuse to the place
where the tyrosyl radical is formed (metal center site at the small
class I RNR subunit). Hence, the radical scavenging activity could
take place in different places along the protein electron chain transfer.
This fact could better explain why different molecular scaffolds can
inhibit RNR enzymes with a similar scavenging activity.

Although
some of the selected N-HAs displayed certain toxicity
to eukaryotic cells, others exhibited good therapeutic index, which
is a measure that takes into account both cytotoxicity and antibacterial
activity values. N-Hydroxylamine compounds with SI
> 5 are interesting and should be well studied to be used as antibiotics,
as bacteria were more affected than eukaryotic cells. In addition,
when analyzing the lipophilicity levels of the most promising compounds,
all of them displayed moderate partition coefficients values, thus
indicating good solubility under physiological conditions.

One
of the current antimicrobial therapy problems we are currently
facing is the use of antibiotics that are not effective to eradicate
bacteria growing in biofilms. Under this growing condition, antibiotics
cannot penetrate through the extracellular matrix produced by the
different bacteria, or if they penetrate, they can be inactivated
by some components of the matrix.7 This
is the reason why bacterial infections growing under biofilm conditions
are extremely resistant to the current chemotherapy, thus preventing
the infection from being eradicated. For this reason, evaluating antibacterial
activity of new molecules in biofilm-growing cells becomes essential
if we want to treat current infections.

When testing the ability
of our new N-HA molecules to eradicate
bacterial biofilms, we found that some of the compounds did reduce
biofilm formation at levels similar to those found for other known
antibiotics, such as CIP. In the case of P. aeruginosa, special attention needs to be done with compound 8 that reduced above 90% of mature biofilm at 48 h at the MIC concentration,
which is similar to the levels of inhibition with the benchmarked
CIP (Figure 4). Not
so effective, but also important, were the results obtained with Staph. aureus and E. coli biofilms, especially with a continuous 3 day treatment.

The
antibiofilm activities of compound 8 were moreover
corroborated in a P. aeruginosa continuous-flow
biofilm, which was stained and observed by CLSM. The results certainly
state that compound 8 has the same effectivity as CIP
to remove well-established and mature P. aeruginosa biofilm (with similar biomass and thickness values) (Figure 5).

P.
aeruginosa is the responsible
for some important chronic pulmonary infections, such as those in
cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchiectasis, or chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). Our compounds could be effective for those diseases,
in which once the infection is established, eradication of P. aeruginosa is nearly impossible due to a biofilm
form of growth. As the existing therapies always fail to eradicate
bacterial biofilms, the results outlined herein show that our compounds
could be highly potent and effective drugs to eradicate biofilm infections
and open an interesting new era of research in this field. In addition,
antibiofilm candidates are ultimately explored to be used not only
in clinical settings but also in eliminating contaminating biofilm
growth in food and veterinary industry, processes that involve pure
water systems.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed
and synthesized a library of N-HA compounds,
acting as radical scavengers, to directly target the bacterial class
I RNR enzyme and inhibit bacterial proliferation. Compounds with different
structures were designed to better cover the chemical space and gain
more selectivity. We have demonstrated the broad antimicrobial effect
of several drug candidates against a variety of Gram-positive and
Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, together with low toxicity toward
eukaryotic cells. In addition, some of the compounds had the ability
to eradicate bacterial biofilms at the same level of known antibiotics.
This work settles the starting point to develop new radical scavenger
compounds as potential antibacterial agents to fight against drug-resistant
pathogenic bacteria.

Experimental Section
All reagents
used for chemical synthesis were purchased from commercially
available sources and used without further purification. Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on
a Varian MERCURY 400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H NMR,
101 MHz for 13C NMR, and 376 MHz for 19F NMR).
Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts per million (ppm)
downfield from tetramethylsilane, and deuterated solvent signal was
used as reference. Coupling constants (J) are expressed
in hertz (Hz). Abbreviations used are s = singlet, bs = broad singlet,
d = doublet, dd = doublets of doublets, t = triplet, td = triplets
of doublets, q = quartet, and m = multiplet. Mass spectra were obtained
at the “Centres Científics i Tecnològics de la
Universitat de Barcelona” (CCiTUB). Compounds tested in the
different biological assays were previously diluted to a stock concentration
of 0.5 to 1 M in H2O to perform the experiments.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis and Characterization of
N-HAs
N-HAs were synthesized by reductive amination of aldehydes,
as described before26 with some variations.
To a mixture of R-aldehyde (1 equiv) in a solution of 5.0 M LiClO4/Et2O (LPDE) (10 mL), O-(trimethylsilyl)hydroxylamine
(1.5 equiv) was added at room temperature. The mixture was stirred
for 10 min, and trimethylsilyl chloride (1.5 equiv) was added. After
stirring the mixture for 8 h, borane/triethylamine complex (1.5 equiv)
was added, and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature
overnight. The reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution to obtain the mono N-alkylhydroxylamine.
The mixture was filtrated, and then the product was extracted with
DCM. The organic extracts were combined, dried with MgSO4, and concentrated. Finally, the crude product was flash-chromatographed
(SiO2) using a hexane–EtOAc gradient from 1:0 to
0:1.

All final compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR (see Supporting Information for product characterization), and HR-ESMS. In
all cases, the purity of the final product was above 95% after flash
chromatography (SiO2).

Log P Calculations
The compounds were
equilibrated in a two-phase octanol–water system in small vials,
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine
the concentration of the compounds in each phase. Compound concentrations
(ci) were calculated using the expression ci = k Ii, where Ii is the integral under
the peak of the HPLC chromatogram and the proportionality constant k is called the response factor. The ratio of the integrals
for the octanol and water phase gave the partition coefficient (P):  

Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
Wild-type P. aeruginosa ATCC 15692 (CECT 4122), Staph. aureus ATCC 12600 (CECT 86), Staph. epidermidis ATCC 1798 (CECT 231), and E. faecalis ATCC 19433 (CECT 481) were obtained from
the Spanish Type Culture Collection (CECT). E. coli O157:H7 Δstx was obtained from laboratory
collection, and B. anthracis Sterne
7700 pXO1–/pXO2– was obtained
from the Swedish Defence Research Agency. These strains were stored
at −80 °C as glycerol stocks. To obtain inocula for examination,
the strains were cultured overnight on trypticase soy agar (TSA) (Scharlau,
Spain) or Luria agar (Scharlau, Spain) at 37 °C. Tryptic soy
broth (TSB) (Sharlau, Spain) or Luria Broth (LB) was used to culture
bacteria at 37 °C.

The murine macrophage J774.A1 cell line
(DSMZ ACC 170) was maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with l-glutamine (Gibco BRL, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Lonza Ltd., Switzerland), containing 100 U/mL penicillin G (Lab ERN,
Barcelona, Spain) and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Reig Jofre Laboratory,
Barcelona, Spain) (complete medium), at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2.

Antibacterial Susceptibility
Testing
To determine survival
of the different strains in the presence of different potential inhibitors,
each bacterial strain was grown in TSB medium to initial exponential
log phase (OD550 ≈ 0.1) and plated in a microtiter
plate with different concentrations of the antimicrobial agents, following
the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.37 Growth curves were monitored for 8 h, taking
the OD550 nm every 15 min in a microplate reader (Infinite
M200 Microplate Reader, Tecan). Bacteria diluted in media with no
compound were used as a positive control of bacterial growth.

The minimal inhibitory concentration 50% (MIC50) was defined
as the compound concentration that reduces bacterial growth, determined
as the OD550, by 50%.

Determination of Mammalian
Cytotoxicity
Murine macrophage
cells (6 × 104 per well) were seeded
onto 48 well tissue culture plates in complete medium (Gibco) without
antibiotics, in the presence of different doses of compounds or left
untreated. After 24 h of exposure to the different compounds, culture
supernatants were removed, and cell viability were measured by the
addition of 10% (w/v) of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) in complete medium was added and incubated for 3 h at
37 °C. Then, water-insoluble dark blue formazan was dissolved
by adding acidic isopropanol. Absorbance was measured at 550 nm using
a microplate reader (Infinite M200 Microplate Reader, Tecan). Results
were expressed as the percent absorbance of treated versus untreated
control cultures.

The 50% cytotoxicity inhibitory concentration
(CC50) of each drug was determined from dose–response
curves. On the basis of the CC50 (24 h) and MIC50 (8 h) values, the selectivity index (SI = CC50/MIC50) was calculated.

Fluorescent Microscopy Viability Test Analysis
Overnight
cultures of B. anthracis, Staph. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli were diluted in fresh
TSB or LB medium, grown to the beginning of exponential phase (OD550 ≈ 0.3), and different compound concentrations were
added. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C under shaking conditions,
cells were harvested and stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial
Viability Kit (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature under
dark conditions, followed by one sterile phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) wash to remove nonspecific stain. Fluorescent bacteria were
visualized by a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope ECLIPSE Ti-S/L100
(Nikon) coupled with a DS-Qi2 Nikon camera.

Static Biofilm Formation
Assay
P. aeruginosa PAO1 static
biofilms were grown on microplates following the protocol
previously described.32,38 An overnight grown culture of P. aeruginosa in TSB was diluted to an OD550 of 0.1 in sterile TSB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and
added to a 96 well microtiter plate with pegs (Nunc-TSP, Thermo Scientific)
(200 μL per well). After 24–48 h incubation at 37 °C
in a humid chamber, the culture supernatant was discarded, and the
pegs were washed three times with sterile PBS to remove nonadherent
cells. After rinsing, the biofilms were treated with different radical
scavenger’s concentrations using twofold serial dilutions in
TSB medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. After 24 h of treatment,
peg lids were transferred to a new plate and rinsed three times with
PBS. Adherent bacteria were first fixed with 98% methanol for 15 min,
allowed to dry for 5 min, and then stained with crystal violet (1%)
for 10 min. An excess of crystal violet was washed gently with water,
and pegs were dried in air for 5 min. The dye bound to the cells was
dissolved with acetic acid 33%, and absorbance was read with a microplate
reader (Infinite M200 Pro Multimode Microplate Reader, Tecan) at a
wavelength of 570 nm.

The static biofilm formation assay for Staph. aureus and E. coli was assessed following the previous protocol but using flat-bottom
96 well polystyrene plates with lid (tissue culture-treated polystyrene,
Costar 3596, Corning Inc., NY), in the case of Staph.
aureus, and 96 well PVC plates, in the case of E. coli.36

Flow Cell Biofilm
Assay
P. aeruginosa biofilm
formed under a continuous flow was cultured in a flow cell
system, as previously described32,39 with some modifications.
Channel flow cells (made of Perspex poly(methyl methacrylate)), with
a channel size of 40 × 4 × 1 mm (DTU Systems Biology, Technical
University of Denmark)), were used and covered with a no. 1 24 ×
50 mm glass coverslip (Deltalab, ref D102450), which served as the
biofilm substratum. Each flow cell channel was inoculated with 350
μL of a P. aeruginosa culture,
diluted to an OD550 = 0.1, and left without medium flow
for 1 h. The biofilm was then allowed to grow in LB medium supplemented
with 0.04% glucose under nutrient flow conditions (3 mL/h) for 96
h at room temperature. The flow was then stopped, and different concentrations
of compounds and CIP diluted in the medium were injected afterward
to the formed biofilms. Medium without any added compound was injected
in a channel as a control for biofilms without treatment. After 24
h, treated biofilms were dyed with 6 μM SYTO 9 and 30 μM
propidium iodide (LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit (Molecular
Probes)) for 30 min under dark conditions and afterward washed with
PBS. Biofilms were imaged with CLSM (Leica TCS-SP5, Leica Microsystems,
Heidelberg, Germany) using excitation and emission wavelengths of
488 and 514 nm, respectively. Sections (250 × 250 μm) were
scanned at a 40× magnification, and Z-stacks
were obtained with a z-step size of 0.388 μm.
The acquired images were analyzed using ImageJ software (National
Institute of Health, USA) and Comstat2 software,40 which were used to quantify biofilm biomass and thickness.

Radical Scavenging Activity Determination
The capacity
of the N-HA compounds to scavenge free radicals was evaluated by determining
the in vitro scavenging of the stable free radical DPPH· (Sigma-Aldrich),
which has an absorption peak at 517 nm in its radical form. Twofold
dilutions of the different compounds were prepared in methanol in
a 96 well microplate with final concentrations ranging from 256 to
0.5 μM, and DPPH· dissolved in methanol was added to initiate
the reaction with a final concentration of 70 μM. The microplate
was incubated at 30 °C under dark conditions, and the absorbance
was read at 517 nm after 8 and 12 h of incubation using a microplate
reader (Infinite M200 Microplate Reader, Tecan). AA and HU were used
as reference radical scavengers. The percentage of radical inhibition
was calculated using the absorbance value of 70 μM DPPH·
without any compound as a reference, and the IC50 value
for each compound was calculated from the linear interval of the curve.

Analysis of NrdA Expression Using Western Immunoblot
P. aeruginosa PAO1 NrdA expression
was determined in protein extracts from cultures in the presence or
absence of N-HA compounds or HU. To do so, Western blot was performed,
as previously described.20 SDS–PAGE
with normalized protein extracts was run, transfer was carried out
in a PVDF membrane, and blotting was done using anti-NrdA rabbit polyclonal
antibody (Agrisera, Sweden) at a 1/750 dilution and Goat Anti-Rabbit
IgG HRP Conjugate (Bio-Rad) as a secondary antibody at a 1/500 dilution.
Amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare)
was used for chemiluminescence detection and visualized using the
LAS4000 mini system (GE Healthcare).

DPA Assay for dNTP Quantification
dNTP levels in P. aeruginosa PAO1
cultures were determined following
the DPA assay for purine dNTP estimation, as previously described.28,29 Bacterial pellets from PAO1 cultured in the presence or absence
of N-HA compounds or HU were suspended in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 5% glycerol), sonicated in an ultrasonic
processor (Branson Sonifier SFX550) until clear, and centrifuged at
20,000g for 30 min. Pellet was discarded, and the
protein concentration of bacterial extracts was quantified using Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was then adjusted for all the
samples, and 0.1 mL of each extract was mixed with 0.4 mL of 0.5 M
chloroacetamide in 0.25 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). The
mixture was incubated for 10 min at 90 °C and cooled to room
temperature, and 2 mL of DPA reagent (2 g of DPA dissolved in 100
mL of acetic acid and 2.75 mL of sulfuric acid) was added and incubated
at 38 °C for 4 h. Absorbance values at a wavelength of 595 nm
were used to determine relative dNTP levels.

Statistical Analysis
All data were statistically analyzed
using GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Mac OS X (GraphPad Software,
USA).
