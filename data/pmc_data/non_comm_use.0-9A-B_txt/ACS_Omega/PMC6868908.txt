Antibiotic resistance
by bacteria has continued to prompt research for new agents that can
inhibit bacterial growth. Therefore, in this study, we described the
synthesis, physicochemical characterization, and the antibacterial
activity of pure metal oxide nanoparticles of ZrO2 and
ZnO and the antibacterial activity of their mixed metal oxide of ZrO2–ZnO nanoparticles against three Gram-positive of Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and 3 Gram-negative
of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella
oxytoca. The nanoparticles were successfully prepared
by sol–gel method and were subsequently characterized using
dynamic light scattering analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained from the characterization
techniques confirm the formation of ZrO2, ZnO, and ZrO2–ZnO nanoparticles with diameter sizes of 76, 22, and
26–34 nm, respectively. SEM reveals spherically shaped nanoparticles.
The XRD shows the formation of monoclinic zirconia and hexagonal zinc
oxide, formation of amorphous compound in Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.5 while Z-Z1.0 and Z-Z2.0 have peaks
that corresponds to the diffractogram pattern present in ZrO2 and ZnO. From the preliminary screening, ZrO2 and the
amorphous particles of Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.5 did
not record any inhibition against any of the test bacteria while ZnO,
Z-Z1.0, and Z-Z2.0 recorded inhibition against
all the tested bacteria.

1 Introduction
Nanoparticles are particles
with a mean diameter size less than or equal to 100 nm and having
a large surface area-to-volume ratio.1 In
recent years, nanoparticles have attracted a lot of attention as a
result of their unique properties in terms of their optical characteristics,
catalytic activity, and antibacterial properties. All these unique
characteristics have enhanced their potential application in different
fields such as biomedical, communications, and electronics.2 With these properties, nanoparticles have been
able to exhibit unique applications3−7 that are being used across fields.

Sol–gel is the formation
of an oxohydroxide compound through hydrolysis from the metal–organic
precursor and the initial reaction is accompanied by condensation
and polymerization to form metal hydroxide and a porous gel with further
treatment to give nanoparticles.8,9

Zirconia has high
strength, high fracture toughness, high chemical stability, and hardness.
These listed characteristics have resulted in the high use of zirconia.10 Zirconia display different phases based on its
temperature. The monoclinic phase is exhibited at room temperature
but at a temperature above 1170 °C it changes to the tetragonal
phase and it exists as the cubic phase at a temperature above 2370
°C. Zirconia nanoparticles had been produced using different
synthetic methods.11−16 Although, most of the synthesized nanoparticles are confronted with
different forms of shortcomings17,18 like agglomeration
which is a part of the defect in the synthesis of single metal oxide
nanoparticles17,18 and in trying to fix these defects
and other shortcomings to improve their quality in their application
in various fields, mixed metal oxide nanoparticles have become the
solution.19,20

ZnO shows excellent characteristics
like high photostability, high electrochemical coupling coefficient,
and high chemical stability,21 and as a
result of its low toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability,
it finds so many uses in biomedicine. Part of its characteristics
has made it suitable for use in sensors, energy generators, and as
photocatalysts for hydrogen production.2 ZnO also possess antibacterial properties, which makes it applicable
for use in the inhibition of bacterial growth.22 The noteworthy mechanism of zinc oxide nanoparticles as
an antibacterial agent has been reported to be attributed to the photocatalytic
generation of hydrogen peroxide.20 ZnO
nanoparticles had been synthesized using various synthetic routes.23−28

In this work, we present the synthesis of pure zirconium oxide,
zinc oxide, and their mixed metal oxide of zirconia and zinc oxide
nanoparticles using the sol–gel method. The antibacterial activity
of ZrO2–ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated on three
Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus
aureus) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca) bacteria. From
our result, it can be reported that the synthesized zirconia–zinc
oxide nanoparticles can find application in the development of medicine.

2 Experimental Methods
2.1 Materials
All
reactants used were of analytical grade and they were used as received.
Acetic acid and deionized water were the solvent used. Zinc nitrate
[Zn(NO3)2], citric acid, NaOH, and zirconium
butoxide [Zr(C4H9O)4] were purchased
from Aldrich. Mueller–Hinton agar plates were used for the
antibacterial test. B. subtilis (ATCC
19163), S. aureus (ATCC 25923), S. mutans (ATCC 25175), E. coli (ATCC 25922), K. oxytoca (13182), P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection.

2.2 Synthesis of ZrO2 Nanoparticles
Synthesis of ZrO2 nanoparticles
was done by sol–gel method as described by previous literature29 with some modifications. Zirconium butoxide
[Zr(OC4H9)4] (3.658 mL) was added
to 10 mL of acetic acid followed by 20 mL of water dropwise. A transparent
sol was obtained within 15 min followed with continuous stirring for
5 h. The sol was kept in an oven at 80 °C for gelation and the
gel obtained was then dried at 100 °C to get a powder. The as-prepared
sample powders were grounded and subjected to calcination at 500 °C
for 4 h to obtain the ZrO2 nanoparticles.

2.3 Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles
ZnO nanoparticles were
synthesized by sol–gel method in accordance with past literature30 but with some modifications. Zinc oxide nanoparticles
were prepared by sol–gel method using citric acid in deionized
water. Initially, 6 mL of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (1 M) solution
(sol) was mixed with 15 mL of water. Citric acid (15 mL) was added
to the solution under dark conditions with constant stirring at 300
rpm. The reactions involved in the process are as shown in eqs 1–3 1   2   3  

For gelation to occur, 10 M NaOH (4.03 g in
10 mL H2O) was added dropwise, a milky white gel was observed,
and the solution was stirred for 4 h. Then, the gel was dried in an
oven at 120 °C to constant weight and calcinated at 400 °C
for 4 h to obtain the ZnO nanoparticles.

2.4 Synthesis
of ZrO2–ZnO Nanoparticles
Synthesis of
ZrO2–ZnO nanoparticles was prepared by the sol–gel
method as described by the literature31 with some modifications. Zirconium butoxide [Zr(OC4H9)4] (3.658 mL) was dissolved in 10 mL of acetic
acid followed by the addition of 20 mL of water dropwise. A transparent
sol was obtained within 15 min. Addition of an aqueous solution of
10 mL of Zn(NO3)2 at different concentrations
as shown in Table 1 to the above sol followed with continuous stirring. The sol was
kept in an oven at 80 °C for gelation and the gel obtained was
then dried at 100 °C to get a powder. The as-prepared sample
powders were grounded and subjected to calcination at 500 °C
for 4 h to obtain the ZrO2–ZnO mixed metal oxide
nanoparticles.

2.5 Methods of Characterization
The crystalline structures of ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z
films were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the measurements
were taken on a RAD-C, Rigaku; with Cu KR at 40 kV and 30 mA. The
scanning range was from 10° to 80°. The surface morphology
of the films was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi
S-3000) with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. The mean
particle size and zeta potential of the nanoparticles were measured
using a HORIBA Scientific, SZ 100 instrument.

2.6 Antibacterial
Activity Determination
Materials used for the antimicrobial
activity study of zirconia, zinc oxide, and Z–Z nanoparticles
were soy broth, Mueller–Hinton agar, Petriplates, cotton swabs,
synthesized nanoparticles samples (zirconia, zinc oxide, Z–Z), B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. mutans, E. coli, K. oxytoca, and P.
aeruginosa. The disc diffusion method was used for
the antimicrobial activity of zinc oxide nanoparticles.

Preparation
of Inoculum
Soy broth (15 g in 500 mL deionise H2O) was prepared in conical flasks and sterilized. In different test
tubes, clinically isolated strains of each of the different bacteria
were inoculated. The bacteria were cultured in the soy broth for 20
h at 37 °C before the test.

Inoculation of Test Plate
Mueller–Hinton agar was prepared (19 g Mueller–Hinton
agar in 500 mL deionized water) and sterilized. The agar suspension
within 15 min was used to inoculate plates by dipping a sterile cotton-wool
swab into the suspension. Then, we spread the inoculum evenly over
the entire surface of the plate by swabbing in different directions.
Allow the plate to dry before applying nanoparticles to the disc.

Disc Diffusion Method for Antimicrobial Activity
Each (0.0005
g) of the synthesized nanoparticles (ZrO2, ZnO, Z-Z0.25, Z-Z0.5, Z-Z1.0, and Z-Z2.0) was weighed before they were used for the antimicrobial activity
study. The agar plate was divided into six sections to accommodate
each of the synthesized nanoparticles. Antibacterial tests were carried
out by the disc diffusion method using the suspension of bacteria
spread on a Mueller–Hinton agar plate. The swab was dipped
into the broth culture of each of the bacteria. Use the swab to a streak agar plate for a lawn
of growth. The inoculated plates were incubated at the appropriate
temperature for 24 h. Each weighed samples of each of the nanoparticles
was placed on the surface of the agar. The antimicrobial activity
was evaluated by measuring the zone of inhibition against the test
organisms with a caliper.32 The antimicrobial
test for all the bacteria was done in triplicate.

Determination
of the Growth Curve
The procedure for the evaluation of the
antimicrobial effect of the different samples was based on Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacterial culture. An apparatus Multiskan EX (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) via Ascent Software for Multiskan was used with
subsequent analysis. The bacterial culture grown overnight was diluted
with the soy medium to an absorbance of 0.1 measured using a PerkinElmer
Lambda spectrophotometer 35 at a wavelength of 540 nm. The diluted
culture was pipetted into a microplate (total volume of 100 μL)
alone as a control variant, and after with the various samples. Measurements
were carried out at time 0, then each half-hour for 24 h at 37 °C,
at a wavelength of 540 nm. The measured absorbance was analyzed in
a graphic form as growth curves for each sample group individually.33

3 Results
and Discussion
At the end of the sol–gel process,
zirconia and the various samples of Z–Z nanoparticles were
produced. The sol–gel reaction involves the hydrolysis and
condensation of zirconium butoxide and zinc nitrate as the precursors
for zirconia and ZnO nanoparticles. Deionized water was added to zirconium
butoxide followed by aqueous solution of zinc nitrate. During the
sol–gel process, zirconium butoxide was hydrolyzed as shown
in eq 4. Then, the condensation
reaction led to the formation of Zr–O–Zr bonds as shown
in eq 5. The overall
reactions employed by the sol–gel method are shown below 4   5  

Aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2 measured
at different concentrations added to the fixed concentration of zirconium
butoxide had an effect on the rate of hydrolysis and condensation.34 The different nanoparticles size of Z–Z
at different concentrations of Zn(NO3)2 against
the fixed concentration of ZrO2 were examined by the average
particle size distribution. By varying the Zn(NO3)2 concentration, the Z–Z nanoparticles were produced
with different sizes. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD,
SEM, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential and the results
of the characterization were reported. The data and results obtained
for the mixed metal oxide nanoparticles of Z–Z were compared
with those of their single metal oxide nanoparticles.

3.1 X-ray Diffraction
XRD of the five synthesized samples
were measured. The samples in the form of films were deposited on
amorphous glass substrates to determine the crystal nature. Figure 1 illustrates the
crystalline phases of ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z nanoparticles.
The XRD patterns of the nanoparticles display the major 2θ peak
values at 24.6°, 28.6°, 31.9°, 50.6°, 55.8°,
and 60.3° corresponding to the monoclinic phase of zirconia;
the peak values correlated with the international standard file (JCPDS
file no. 37-1484)35,36 with the definite line broadening
of the XRD peaks indicating that the prepared nanoparticles consist
of particles within the nanoscale range. The diffraction peaks located
at 31.84°, 34.64°, 36.39°, 47.72°, 56.80°,
63.12°, and 68.16° have been indexed as the hexagonal phase
of ZnO.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of ZrO2, ZnO and Z–Z nanoparticles.

In the XRD for Z–Z samples, it was found
that only Z-Z(1.0) and Z-Z(2.0) showed peaks
in the XRD while the corresponding Z–Z nanoparticles synthesized
at low concentrations of ZnO against ZrO2 as seen in samples
Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.50 were found to be amorphous
with no identifiable peaks. At a higher concentration of ZnO against
ZrO2 in samples Z-Z1.0 and Z-Z2.0 it was possible to identify peaks corresponding to ZrO2 and ZnO, respectively. The appearance of significantly intensified
diffraction peaks in samples Z-Z1.0 and Z-Z2.0 reveals the preferential orientation of the crystallographic plane
and the higher crystallinity of ZnO. Besides these peaks, there are
other distinct features of the diffractogram, with the clearest ones
being a large diffuse signal between 20° and 30° because
of the amorphous glass substrate used for the analysis.

3.2 SEM Result
The synthesized ZrO2, ZnO, Z-Z0.5, and Z-Z2.0 nanoparticles were characterized
for their morphology by scanning transmission electron microscopy
and for their elemental content by EDX spectroscopy. Figure 2a shows the SEM image of zirconia
nanoparticles as spherically shaped, heavily aggregated and without
any form of dispersity. An EDX spectrum of ZrO2 nanoparticles
is shown in Figure 2b. The spectrum shows the elemental composition indicating the presence
of zirconium and oxygen. In Figure 2c, the SEM image of zinc oxide nanoparticles reveals
spherically shaped nanoparticles with an irregular surface morphology
with some amount of aggregation. An EDX spectrum of ZnO nanoparticles
is shown in Figure 2d. The spectrum shows the elemental composition indicating the presence
of zinc and oxygen. The SEM image of Z-Z0.5 is shown in Figure 2e, which reveals
the morphology of the prepared material as a cluster of amorphous
particles, and as shown in Figure 2f, the elemental composition of the sample indicated
the presence of zirconium, zinc, and oxygen. Figure 2g shows the irregular growth of Z-Z2.0. The EDX spectrum in Figure 2h shows the presence of zirconium, zinc, and oxygen.37 The result obtained from the EDX analysis validates
the purity of the element that made up the components of each samples
with the presence of carbon and aluminium because of the carbon tape
used and the base support, respectively.

respectively, of (a,b) ZrO2, (c,d) ZnO, (e,f) Z-Z0.5, and (g,h) Z-Z2.0 nanoparticles.

3.3 DLS Analysis
Particle size analysis was
performed to determine the size distribution of the synthesized samples
of ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z nanoparticles in deionized
water. The particle size of the suspended nanoparticles as obtained
from the DLS analysis shows ZrO2 to be (76 nm), ZnO (22
nm), Z-Z0.25 (amorphous), Z-Z0.50 (amorphous),
Z-Z1.0 (34 nm), and Z-Z2.0 (26 nm). From the
result, ZnO nanoparticles recorded the smallest nanoparticle size
of mean diameter 22 nm, while ZrO2 nanoparticles have the
biggest nanoparticle size of 76 nm. The result of the DLS analysis
agrees with the morphological appearance as shown by the SEM micrographs
which shows that the sample with the most agglomeration has the highest
nanoparticle size and the one with the least agglomeration has the
smallest nanoparticles size.

3.4 FTIR Spectra
A
fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer was used to analyze
and compare the functional group of the reactants Zr(OC4H9)4, Zn(NO3)2 and that
of the products ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z nanoparticles.
A wavelength of 4000–400 cm–1 was used for
the analyses of the functional groups of the samples, and the results
can be seen in Figure 3. Figure 3a,b shows
the comparison between the IR spectra of zirconium butoxide and zinc
nitrate that were used as the precursor (Figure 3a) to the IR spectra of the products formed
(Figure 3b). In Figure 3b, it was found that
some peaks have been lost as a result of calcination of the reactants
and there was formation of a new peak to show that a new product was
formed. All the distinct absorption peaks of zirconium butoxide were
illustrated in Table 2 and every absorption peak was assigned to the corresponding vibrations. Figure 3b shows the IR spectrum
of ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z samples in the range 4000–400
cm–1. A wavenumber of 482 cm–1 was assigned to Zr–O bond which is in accordance with previous
work.38 A wavenumber of 556 cm–1 was assigned to the Zn–O bond similar to another report.39 By adding ZrO2 to ZnO, the shift
in wavenumber at the frequency of 800–400 cm–1 can be observed. A wavenumber of 784, 732,632, and 550 cm–1 were found in Z-Z0.25, Z-Z0.5, Z-Z1.0, and Z-Z2.0, respectively. Typically, bands placed at
higher frequencies are assigned to Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.5. These high frequencies of Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.50 confirm the results of the XRD, suggesting the formation
of amorphous materials.40 The shift of
the wavenumber indicated that the addition of ZnO to ZrO2 changed the structure of ZrO2. Figure 3c shows that the M–O band of the products
gave clear evidence that the absorption bands were found within the
fingerprint region.

3.5 Zeta Potential Measurement of ZrO2–ZnO Nanoparticles
Zeta potential is the net surface
charge of nanoparticles and it is the potential difference between
the dispersion medium and the static layer of the fluid on the dispersed
particle. The repulsion and the attraction interaction between the
nanoparticles are determined by the surface charges present between
the nanoparticles. Therefore, the zeta potential values enable us
to know whether a nanoparticle will agglomerate or disperse.

From Table 3, Z-Z2.0 with an average nanoparticles size of 26 nm recorded the
highest zeta potential value of −38.50 mV, and it is moderately
stable while ZnO nanoparticles with an average nanoparticles size
of 22 nm has a zeta potential of 13.78 mV and can be said to be incipiently
unstable. Table 3 shows
the zeta potential values and the stability behavior for each of the
synthesized nanoparticles. It was observed that as the concentration
of zinc nitrate increases against a fixed concentration of zirconium
butoxide, the stability between the nanoparticles increases.

3.6 Results
of the Antibacterial Activity of ZnO and Z–Z Nanoparticles
A disk diffusion assay was performed to analyze the inhibition
zone of ZnO and Z–Z samples against Gram (+) and Gram (−)
bacteria. The antibacterial activity exhibited by all the synthesized
nanoparticles which prevents the growth of the bacteria can be seen
in the form of the clear zone in the disks as seen in Figure 4. Here, ZnO, Z-Z1.0, and Z-Z2.0 showed activity against all the tested bacteria
at different levels while Z-Z0.25 and Z-Z0.5 did not record any antibacterial activity against any of the test
bacteria. The data show that the inhibition zone diameter for synthesized
ZnO nanoparticles is maximum as compared to other synthesized nanoparticles.
The antibacterial activity test of the pure metal oxide nanoparticles
and the mixed metal oxide nanoparticles were tested against six bacteria
species which include three Gram-positive bacteria: B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. mutans and three Gram-negative
bacteria: E. coli, P.
aeruginosa, and K. oxytoca.

disc diffusion test on (a) B. subtilis, (b) S. aureus, (c) S. mutans, (d) E. coli, (e) K. oxytoca, and (f) P. aeruginosa.

The results of the antibacterial activity studies are presented in Table 4 while Figure 5a–f show the graphical
representation of the antibacterial study. The antibacterial activity
of the pure metal and the synthesized mixed metal oxides nanoparticles
were determined by the method described by Maneerung et al.32

The antibacterial activities gradually increased with
increasing ZnO content against the fixed ZrO2. The reduction
in antibacterial activity of ZnO in the presence of ZrO2 is ascribed to the decrease in the oxidation power of ZnO nanoparticles.
In addition, ZnO nanoparticles lead to an increase in the formation
of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) that leads to the destruction of
the bacterial cells. These elevated ROS have many effects on the bacteria
such as lipid peroxidation. This lipid peroxidation affects the bacterial
membrane integrity.42 As a result, there
is a high level of membrane leakage. On addition of ZrO2 to ZnO, this ability was reduced. The destruction of the cell wall
of the bacteria leads to bacterial death with increasing concentration
of zinc oxide nanoparticles. It is worth mentioning that the binding
of ZnO and Z–Z nanoparticles to bacteria depends on the surface
area available for interaction. The mechanism by which nanoparticles
penetrate bacteria cannot be explained completely, but studies have
suggested that when bacteria are treated with nanoparticles, changes
take place in its cell membrane morphology. In general, studies have
shown that nanoparticles could penetrate the bacteria as a result
of their unique morphology. The diffusion of nanoparticles across
the membrane of the bacteria is directly proportional to the size
of the nanoparticles. The smaller the nanoparticles, the higher the
chances of permeating and damaging the bacteria membrane. The presence
of ion channels and transporter protein has aided the movement of
nanoparticles across the plasma membrane. The sequence of the ionization
of ZnO to liberate Zn2+ ions can be seen as shown in eqs 6 and 7 6   7  

Among various other means,
Zn2+ solute from nanoparticles pass across the cell as
described by the literature.43 The sequence
of the inhibition mechanism of nanoparticles after penetrating the
membrane is initiated by the direct interaction with oxidative organelles.
This in turn enables Zn2+ produced by nanoparticles (eq 7) to generate ROS through
different chemical reactions. The induced ROS halts gene expression
and results in DNA damage. In addition to halting gene expression,
Zn2+ ions can cause protein denaturation through the disruption
of the metal ions in metalloproteins. The released ions from the nanoparticles
through the aforementioned actions disrupt the metal cation stability
of the cell which eventually leads to death. ZnO nanoparticles may
be used to treat or prevent infections. Using the methods of mixing
zirconia to ZnO nanoparticles on medical devices can help to fight
bacterial infection to a large extent.

3.7 Growth
Characteristics
The different bacterial growth was assessed
at a wavelength of 540 nm over time and was plotted using Origin 8.5
software. Each well was read for 96 counts for 24 h. The growth kinetics
of the Gram (+) and Gram (−) bacteria was analyzed in the presence
and absence of the chemically synthesized ZnO and the mixed samples
of Z–Z nanoparticles. Growth curves of the treated bacterial
culture experience a decline in comparison to that of the untreated
one with time. This suggests that the ZnO and Z–Z nanoparticles
have activity against the bacterial growth [Figures 6 and 7a,c,e]. The
growth curves in Figures 6 and 7 shows that treatment of chemically
synthesized ZnO and Z-Z2.0 inhibits the growth of the test
bacteria more than the other mixed samples. As the concentration of
the ZnO increases against the ZrO2, the decline in the
growth kinetics becomes more pronounced.

Figures 6 and 7b,d,f show the statistical analyses of data obtained
from the growth characteristics study of ZrO2–ZnO
nanoparticles as computed using SPSS 16.0 software. All computations
were executed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean
± SD. The antimicrobial assay was computed with suitable dilutions
for each sample. One-way analysis of variance was used for analysis
of data obtained from the different samples. The P values <0.05 were taken as indicative of statistical significance.

4 Conclusions
ZrO2, ZnO, and Z–Z
nanoparticles have been successfully prepared by sol–gel method.
The XRD analysis shows the formation of monoclinic ZrO2, cubic hexagonal ZnO with amorphous formation at lower concentrations
of ZnO against zirconia and the appearance of peaks that corresponds
to both ZrO2 and ZnO at higher concentrations of ZnO against
ZrO2. From the SEM analysis, spherically formed nanoparticles
were obtained. DLS analysis shows that ZnO has the smallest size of
22 nm while ZrO2 nanoparticles have the biggest size of
76 nm. From the antibacterial activity study, despite the better stability
of Z-Z2.0 when compared to ZnO, ZnO still recorded the
highest inhibition against all the test bacteria because of its higher
ROS generation.
