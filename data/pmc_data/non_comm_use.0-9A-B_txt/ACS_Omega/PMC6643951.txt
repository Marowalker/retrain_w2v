Novel photocatalysts -CdSe quantum
dots (QDs)/g-C3N4- were successfully constructed.
The structure, chemical composition,
and optical properties of the prepared samples were investigated via
a series of characterization techniques. The results indicated that
CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 photocatalysts exhibited remarkably
enhanced photocatalytic activity for visible-light-induced H2 evolution compared to pristine g-C3N4 and
CdSe QDs and addition of 13.6 wt % CdSe QDs into the composite photocatalyst
generated the highest H2 production rate. The enhanced
photocatalytic performance of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 can be attributed to the synergistic effects of excellent visible
absorption and high charge separation efficiency from the heterostructure.
This work could not only provide a facile method to fabricate semiconductor
QDs-modified g-C3N4 photocatalysts but also
contribute to the design for heterostructures.

Introduction
The use of inexhaustible
solar light to drive the decomposition
of water to hydrogen has been perceived as one of the most promising
solutions to alleviate the energy crisis and the pollution of fossil
consumption. Because the pioneering work reported by Fujishima and
Honda on photochemical splitting of water over TiO2 electrodes,1 the photocatalytic process has intrigued intensive
research endeavor and appears to be more amenable to clean, low-cost,
and environmentally friendly solar hydrogen production. Because of
the fact that visible light takes up ∼43% of the solar spectrum,
H2 evolution under visible light irradiation should be
particularly addressed if one thinks of the utilization of solar energy
to the uttermost.2,3 Recently, polymeric graphitic
carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has shown good photocatalytic
performance for hydrogen evolution from water splitting in the visible
light region.4 Besides, g-C3N4 has presented a lot of advantages such as abundance
of constituent elements, high stability, and comparatively simple
synthesis, rendering it considerably applicable in the field of photocatalytic
hydrogen generation.5−7 However, the high recombination rate of the photogenerated
electron–hole pairs and deficient visible light absorption
inhibited its photocatalytic performance.8,9 Tremendous
efforts have thus been dedicated to improve the photocatalytic performance,
such as construction of the mesoporous structure,10 doping of nonmetal11−14 or metal,15,16 and coupling with other
materials.17−20

It is worth noting that a lot of semiconductors have been
chosen
to couple with g-C3N4 to form heterostructures
with intimate conjunctions. Among them, traditional type-II heterojunctions
have been mainly investigated. When the traditional type-II heterojunctions
are irradiated, the photogenerated electrons in the conduction band
(CB) of the semiconductor with more negative levels can migrate to
the CB of another semiconductor, while the photogenerated holes in
the valence band (VB) of the semiconductor with more positive levels
can migrate to the VB of the other one, which implies more efficient
charge separation. For example, Obregón and Colón developed
Pt–TiO2/g-C3N4–MnOx hybrid structures with enhanced photoactivities
for H2 evolution and ascribed it to the efficient separation
of photogenerated charge carriers benefited from the type-II heterostructure.21 Chen et al. found that in the Cu2O/g-C3N4 composites the efficient visible light
absorption and type-II band alignment induced charge separation should
be the key factor for the improved photocatalytic performance.22 Yu et al. established the g-C3N4/CdS composites with the type-II heterojunction, which presented
significantly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production compared
with pure g-C3N4 and CdS.23 In addition, Z-scheme heterojunctions were reported as
well. Different from the type-II heterojunction, the photogenerated
electrons in the CB of the semiconductor with more positive levels
migrate to the VB of the other semiconductor, thus leaving holes and
electrons in the VB and CB of the two semiconductors in Z-scheme heterojunctions,
respectively. Chen et al. obtained Z-scheme WO3/g-C3N4 composite which exhibited the enhanced photocatalytic
activity for degradation of methylene blue and fuchsin under visible
light illumination.24 In the hybriding
system of α-Fe2O3/g-C3N4 constructed by She et al., the remarkably efficient photocatalytic
performance toward hydrogen production was resulted from effectively
suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs with the
Z-scheme junction.25 Wang et al. constructed
the Z-scheme heterostructure of Bi3TaO7 quantum
dots (QDs)/g-C3N4 with high-efficiency degradation
of the antibiotic.26

Despite enormous
efforts that have been made in the design of g-C3N4-based heterojunctions, little consideration
is given to the g-C3N4 photocatalysts modified
with QDs. QDs often refer to semiconductor nanocrystals with their
particle sizes less than twice the Bohr radius of exciton in the bulk
materials. They present many unique properties such as quantum size
effect and multiple exciton generation effect.27−31 Importantly, their band gaps could be modulated via
the alteration of quantum size, which is beneficial for the design
of heterojunction photocatalysts with matching band gap energy. In
addition, the nanosized QDs present a sufficient contact with the
substrate, which brings about efficient electronic mobile channel
and shortens migration distance, and thus resulting in increased reactive
sites. Particularly, CdSe QDs have gained special interest because
of the suitable band gap and high efficiency in photocatalysis. For
instance, previous study shows that the combination of TiO2 with CdSe QDs could effectively improve hydrogen evolution efficiency
of the system.32 The combination of CdSe
QDs and g-C3N4 will probably give rise to a
suitable band alignment as well, which is important in separating
electron–hole pairs in the system.33 Therefore, it is necessary to build heterostructure of CdSe and
g-C3N4 for the enhanced photocatalytic performance.

In this study, we reported the facile synthesis of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites with various loading contents for
CdSe QDs. The microstructures, morphologies, chemical compositions,
and optical properties of the samples were investigated via a series
of characterization techniques. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation
was used to evaluate the photoactivities of the as-prepared samples.
The influence of sacrificial agent, pH value, and CdSe QDs contents
on the photocatalytic performance of the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite was systematically studied. Finally, the possible
charge-transfer mechanisms of photoinduced charge carriers for the
composite photocatalysts were depicted.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Analysis
CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites
were fabricated by the mixing of g-C3N4 and
CdSe QDs with addition of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (see Experimental section for detail). Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 samples with
different CdSe QDs contents together with those of the pure CdSe QDs
and g-C3N4. XRD profile of CdSe QDs indicates
that the as-prepared pure CdSe QDs is crystallized in the zinc blende
structure. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks at 26.6°, 42.6°,
and 50.3° are ascribed to the diffraction of (111), (220) and
(311) planes, respectively (PDF #19-0191). The grain size of CdSe
QDs calculated from Scherrer’s formula is close to 2.1 nm.
The XRD profile recorded for pure g-C3N4 features
two distinct diffraction peaks at 27.6° and 13.1°. The high-intensity
peak at 27.6° reflects the interlayer stacking of aromatic segments
and can be indexed as the (002) peak of the graphitic phase. The peak
at 13.1° indexed as the (100) peak should be associated with
an interplanar separation. These diffraction patterns are consistent
with the recent report on g-C3N4.34 For the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites, the diffraction characters are similar with that of
pure g-C3N4, indicating that the introduction
of CdSe QDs does not impact the crystal structure of g-C3N4. It should be noted that when the loading amount of
CdSe QDs is less than 13.6 wt %, no observable peak for CdSe QDs has
been detected. However, exceeding the CdSe QDs content over 13.6%
by weight gives rise to diffraction peaks corresponding to CdSe QDs
and the intensity increases with further enhancement of the CdSe QDs
content. This proves that CdSe QDs are indeed supported on g-C3N4.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution
TEM
(HRTEM) images were taken to directly analyze the structure and morphology
of the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite. As reflected
by Figure 2a, the CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 composite displays lamellar-like
structure which is close to that of pure g-C3N4 reported by literature denoting that the hybriding CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 is very stable. It can be observed from Figure 2b that small grains
with clear bright and dark stripes exist in the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite of which the size is in the range of 2–3
nm. In addition, the lattice fringes with d-spacing
equal to 0.354 nm can be assigned to the (111) crystal plane of zinc
blende CdSe QDs. Therefore, it can be confirmed that CdSe QDs were
successfully anchored on the surface of lamellar-like g-C3N4. In addition, the specific surface area obtained for
g-C3N4 and CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 is respectively 8.0 and 9.2 m2/g, demonstrating that
CdSe loading increased the surface area of g-C3N4 a little bit. On the other hand, the composite has an average pore
diameter of 16.4 nm which is bigger than individual g-C3N4 (13.5 nm). This may result from the formation of more
pores because of aggregation of CdSe QDs on the surface of g-C3N4.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis
The surface
compositions and chemical states of the as-prepared samples were systematically
investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement.
The full XPS spectrum of the pure g-C3N4 shown
in Figure S1 revealed the existence of
chemical elements C and N. In comparison with g-C3N4, the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite shows
the evident Cd 3d and Se 3d peaks, which verifies the successful grafting
of CdSe QDs on the g-C3N4. As shown in Figure 3a, the C 1s spectrum
of pure g-C3N4 can be deconvoluted into two
peaks at 284.9 and 288.4 eV, which are ascribed to sp2 C=C
bonds and the sp2-bonded carbon in N-containing aromatic
rings (N–C=N). The corresponding binding energies of
the N 1s spectrum are determined to be 398.5, 399.7, and 401 eV (Figure 3b). The primary peak
located at 398.5 eV is identified as the sp2-bonded N involved
in the triazine rings (C–N=C). The two weak peaks at
399.6 and 401 eV can be indexed to the tertiary nitrogen N–(C)3 groups and charging effects. Regarding to the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 (Figure 3a,b), it can be detected that the C 1s peak at 284.9 eV became
much more predominant compared with that of g-C3N4, which may be ascribed to the electron-withdrawing effect of CdSe
QDs on g-C3N4. Similarly, this effect can also
account for the descending binding energy of N 1s in CdSe QDs/g-C3N4.35 The fine XPS spectrum
of Cd 3d can be devolved typically into two peaks at 405.4 and 412.2
eV (Figure 3c), which
can be assigned to the binding energies of Cd 3d5/2 and
Cd 3d3/2. Figure 3d shows the photoelectron peaks for Se 3d at 54.2 and 55.0
eV corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2. These
results manifest a strong electronic interaction between CdSe QDs
and g-C3N4.

UV–Vis Absorption
Properties
The optical absorption
behaviors of g-C3N4, CdSe QDs, and CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites were investigated by UV–vis
diffuse and reflection spectroscopy. As depicted in Figure 4, the pristine g-C3N4 shows its fundamental absorption edge rising at about
450 nm, which can be assigned to its intrinsic band gap of 2.76 eV.
The band gaps of the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites
were also estimated by Kubelka–Munk equation (Figure S2, Table S1), which nearly
does not change when compared with that of pure g-C3N4. The absorption onset of CdSe QDs is 490 nm and the bandgap
can be calculated to be 2.53 eV. It can thus be speculated that the
excellent visible-region optical absorption of CdSe QDs makes it possible
to sensitize g-C3N4 with extending optical response.
On the other hand, in view of the fact that the VB maximum is fixed
with the different sizes of CdSe QDs, namely 1.1 eV,36 the CB of CdSe QDs is therefore estimated as −1.43
eV. Compared to the pure g-C3N4, all CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 samples exhibited red-shift in the absorption
edges, which enable them to utilize a higher fraction of the solar
energy spectrum. Meanwhile, the spectral range is correlated to the
content of CdSe QDs in the composite. The most exceptional absorption
capability was achieved after g-C3N4 was hybridized
with 13.6 wt % of CdSe QDs. This implies that the fabrication of the
heterostructure can be regarded as a promising approach in tuning
the desirable optical characters for photocatalysts.

Photocatalytic Performance Study
Photocatalytic H2 evolution was employed to evaluate the
photoactivity of CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 by monitoring the time-dependent
production of H2 gas under the visible light irradiation.
First of all, species of sacrificial reagents for hole capture in
the photocatalytic system were studied. As can be seen in Figure 5a, three different
electron sacrificial agents including methanol, triethanolamine, and
ascorbic acid (H2A) were chosen to investigate the photocatalytic
hydrogen production of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4. It is
interesting to find that the rate of hydrogen production for CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 in H2A is obviously advantageous
over another two systems, but the further mechanism of the effect
of the sacrificial reagent on the H2 production activity
is still unclear at this stage. Furthermore, the effect of pH value
on the photocatalytic efficiency of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 was studied (Figure 5b). The hydrogen production ceased after 4 h irradiation either
at the pH of 2.5, 7.1, or 9.2. On the contrary, the photocatalytic
H2 evolution rate of 103.1 μmol·g–1 h–1 was retained with pH of 4.0. This is due to
more efficient dissociation of H2A toward HA− considering the pKa1 of H2A as 4.0, which provides more HA− species acting
as the sacrificial reductant to capture holes so that more photogenerated
electrons can participate in proton reduction of hydrogen production.37

Figure 5 Amount of hydrogen evolved from 3.4 wt % CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 in different conditions by changing sacrificial
reagent
(a) or pH value (b) of the system.

We further explored the photocatalytic properties of CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 composites with various CdSe QDs
loading amounts.
A significant impact of the CdSe QD content is presented in Figure 6a. The hydrogen production
of pristine g-C3N4 after exposure to visible
light for 4 h was 0.14 μmol, which is probably caused by the
high recombination efficiency of charge carriers and insufficient
visible light absorption. Upon the introduction of CdSe QDs into g-C3N4, the rate of hydrogen evolution gradually elevates
as the content of CdSe QDs in the composite increases. It reaches
a maximum value of 615 μmol·g–1 h–1 for the composite loaded with 13.6 wt % CdSe QDs,
which is approximately 76 times of that with bare g-C3N4 and twice with CdSe QDs. However, further augmentation of
the amount of CdSe QDs from 13.6 to 27.2 wt % leads to reduced hydrogen
production rate. This is within expectation because excessive CdSe
QDs may aggregate to form the recombination center of electron–hole
pairs. What is especially worth mentioning is that the amount of evolved
hydrogen on 13.6 wt % CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 within
4 h has far exceeded that of g-C3N4 and
CdSe QDs, indicating that the synergetic effects between CdSe QDs
and g-C3N4 are key factors for the enhanced
photoactivity of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4. Moreover,
the stability of the 13.6 wt % CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite has been investigated. As reflected by Figure 6b, the composite has maintained
a steady increase of photocatalytic hydrogen generation with slight
fluctuations under continuous illumination for 12 h. Figure S3 shows that the H2 evolution rate was
almost maintained after three cycles. Moreover, it is noted that the
crystal structure of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 after photocatalytic
reaction is almost identical to that of original CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 (Figure S4). These
results altogether verify the relatively good photostability of the
CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite.

% Pt was used as the cocatalyst.

Possible Photocatalytic Mechanism Discussion
The low
photocatalytic activity observed in the g-C3N4 sample is attributed to its limited visible light absorption as
well as the high recombination efficiency of photogenerated charges.
For the heterostructure, the significantly elevated photocatalytic
activity could be rationalized from three factors: the optical absorption,
separation of the charge carriers and surface reaction (often related
with surface area), which are directly correlated with the photocatalytic
performance. First, the visible light absorption of g-C3N4 has the maximum increase upon introduction of 13.6
wt % CdSe QDs, which is in line with the photocatalytic performance.
In addition, the specific surface area obtained, respectively, for
g-C3N4 and CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 is 8.0 and 9.2 m2/g, and such a small change implies
that the effect of surface area on catalytic activity is not the most
important factor.

Furthermore, charge separation efficiency
of the composite was studied for better understanding of the system.
The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples excited
at 390 nm were hence recorded (Figure 7). PL spectra of the g-C3N4 present
a strong emission peak centered at around 450 nm, which could be associated
with the intrinsic recombination of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs of g-C3N4. This was further confirmed
by the negligible emission of CdSe QDs. For the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites, emission peaks located at ca. 450 nm were
maintained. It thus demonstrated that the PL property of the CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 composites should be mainly relevant
with the recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers from
g-C3N4 instead of CdSe QDs. Figure 7 further displays that all
the CdSe QDs/C3N4 composites exhibit dramatically
lower emission intensity than pure g-C3N4. This
should not be caused by the light shielding of CdSe QDs because the
absorption of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 remained almost
the same as that of pure g-C3N4 at the excitation
wavelength. Therefore, PL quenching of g-C3N4 by CdSe QDs demonstrates the improved charge separation process
in the composite.

Figure 7 Steady-state PL spectra of different photocatalysts.

To further elucidate the efficient
charge transportation, the photoelectrochemical
properties of pure g-C3N4 and 13.6 wt % CdSe
QDs/g-C3N4 composite electrodes were investigated
for several on–off cycles of irradiation. As can be seen from Figure 8a, the photocurrent
value rapidly decreases to zero as soon as the irradiation of light
turns off but rises to a constant value once the light is on, verifying
the photoactivated nature of the process. Notably, the photocurrent
intensity of the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite is
much higher than that of the pure g-C3N4 sample,
which corroborates the accelerated electron transfer on the interface
of the composite thus decreasing the back recombination of charge
carriers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the samples
have also been portrayed (Figure 8b). In contrast to bare g-C3N4, CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 shows a much smaller semicircle,
indicating the smaller impedance of the composite, which further confirms
more efficient charge separation in the composite.

Figure 8 Transient photocurrent
response (a) and EIS of g-C3N4 and 13.6 wt %
CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 (b).

According to the abovementioned analysis, we further studied
the
photocatalytic mechanism of the system. First, the band levels of
CdSe QDs and g-C3N4 were compared with each
other. The VB of g-C3N4 (2.41 V) is more positive
than that of CdSe QDs (1.1 V), whereas the CB of CdSe QDs (−1.43
V) is more negative than that of g-C3N4 (−0.35
V, obtained from Mott–Schottky (MS) plots, Figure S5). Moreover, work function of CdSe QDs and g-C3N4 was determined by the density functional theory
(DFT) calculation, which was determined to be 4.76 and 3.99 eV, respectively.
This implies that g-C3N4 has a higher Fermi
level than CdSe QDs. Accordingly, when the two semiconductors are
in direct contact, the free electrons will flow from g-C3N4 to CdSe QDs until their Ef are aligned at the same level, which results in a built-in electric
field at the interface. The interfacial electric field then causes
the depletion or accumulation of free-charge carriers near the semiconductor
surface compared with the bulk (Figure 9). Ultimately, the energy band edges in g-C3N4 are bended upward continuously toward the interface,
and those in CdSe QDs are bended downward toward the interface. The
downward band bending allows the electrons to flow out freely while
holes are inhibited.38 Therefore, the type-II
heterojunction is formed for the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite.

Figure 9 Charge transfer process in the type-II heterojunction
which is
determined by the work function (or Fermi level, Ef) of the two semiconductors.

Schematic demonstration on the photocatalytic mechanism is
then
presented in Figure 10. When the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite is illuminated,
both CdSe QDs and g-C3N4 are excited to generate
electrons. The electrons on the CB of CdSe QDs are inclined to flow
toward the CB of g-C3N4, which further reduce
protons into H2. At the same time, the holes left on VB
of g-C3N4 will move to the valence band of CdSe
QDs and are subsequently consumed by sacrificial reagents. In the
system, both the visible light response and charge separation efficiency
were promoted, which improves the photocatalytic efficiency in the
end.

with CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 under visible-light irradiation.

Conclusions
In
summary, an efficient visible-light-driven CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite was achieved by simply hybriding of
individual components. The highest photocatalytic hydrogen production
rate was obtained at 615 μmol·g–1 h–1 for the 13.6 wt % CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite, which was almost 76 times over that of pristine g-C3N4. Furthermore, the composite showed a good photostability
under visible light irradiation. The enhanced photocatalytic capability
was ascribed to the formation of the type-II heterojunction between
g-C3N4 and CdSe QDs, which not only promoted
the visible light absorption but also resulted in an efficient charge
separation of the photoexcited electron–hole pairs. The current
work would offer new insights into architecture of visible-light-driven
photocatalysts from viewpoint of QDs-based heterojunctions.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of CdSe QDs
CdSe QDs were synthesized according
to the previous literature with modification.32 In a typical process, 46 mg of CdCl2·2.5H2O and 26 μL of 3-mercaptopropionic acid were sequentially added
to a flask containing 190 mL of deionized water, and the pH value
of the solution was adjusted to 11 with a NaOH aqueous solution (10
mol·L–1). After adding polyethylene glycol
(20 mg, molecular weight 20 000), Ar gas was passed for 30
min to provide an oxygen-free atmosphere. Then 10 mL of Na2SeSO3 solution (5 mmol·L–1) was
added in two portions, the resulting mixture was refluxed at 130 °C
for 4 h to obtain a yellow-green CdSe QDs solution. The CdSe QDs were
precipitated by adding isopropanol into the transparent solution and
separated by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm. After drying at
60 °C for 6 h, they can be redispersed into water.

Preparation
of g-C3N4
The g-C3N4 nanosheets were synthesized by thermal polymerization.39,40 Melamine powder (15 g) was heated in an alumina crucible with a
cover in a muffle furnace to 550 °C at a heating rate of 4.6
°C/min and maintained for 2 h. After the crucible was cooled
to room temperature, the reacted bulk sample was grounded into powder
and placed in a crucible, annealed at 550 °C for another 2 h.
After naturally cooling to room temperature, a pale yellow solid powder
was obtained.

Preparation of CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 Composites
50 mg of g-C3N4 solid powder was dispersed
in 10 mL of ethanol and subjected to sonication for 30 min. After
this, 40 mL of CdSe QDs solution (0.17 mg·mL–1) and 100 μL of 3-mercaptopropionic acid were added and the
mixture solution was vigorously stirred for 2 h. The suspension was
then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 8 min and the supernatant was removed.
The resulting solid was dried at 60 °C for 12 h to give a 13.6
wt % CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite. CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with other CdSe loading amounts
were synthesized using the similar route by adjusting the dosage of
CdSe QDs solution. Unless otherwise stated, the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 mentioned in this work all refers to 13.6 wt % CdSe
QDs in the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composite.

Characterization
A PANalytical X’Pert X-ray
diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation source, operating voltage: 40
kV, operating current: 40 mA, scanning range: 10°–70°)
was used to characterize the crystal structure of the sample. TEM
images were obtained from an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
measurements were conducted using ASAP 2020 V4.02 with N2 as the adsorbate at liquid nitrogen temperature. The surface chemical
composition of the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 composites
were further analyzed by the X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB
250XI, ThermoFisher Scientific USA), where the binding energy shifts
were corrected using the C 1s level at 284.6 eV as the benchmark.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were taken with a Shimadzu
2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The PL spectra of the samples
were obtained by a HITACHI F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer.
The photoelectrochemical properties of g-C3N4 and CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 were evaluated using a
CHI660E electrochemical workstation with a standard three-electrode
system using the fluorine-doped tin oxide conductive glass coated
with prepared samples as the working electrodes, a Pt wire as the
counter electrode, and a saturated calomel as a reference electrode.
A 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as
the electrolyte. Working electrodes were prepared according to our
previous work.41,42

DFT Calculations
All DFT calculations were performed
by the plane-wave pseudopotential approach implemented in the Cambridge
Sequential Total Energy Package (CASTEP) code with the cutoff energy
of 380 eV. The valence electron configurations were 4d105s2 for Cd, 4s24p4 for Se, 2s22p2 for C, and 2s22p3 for
N, respectively. The electron-ion interactions were represented by
the Vanderbilt ultrasoft pseudopotential. The 2 × 2 × 1
Monkhorst–Pack k-points were used for the
monolayer sheets. All atoms were relaxed and the geometry optimization
stopped until the residual force was below 0.01 eV/Å. Spin polarization
and dipole correction were applied for all calculations. The van der
Waals interactions in the CdSe QDs/g-C3N4 system
were properly described by the Grimme dispersion corrected method.

Photocatalytic Activity Evaluation
The photocatalytic
reaction was carried out in an outer-irradiation-type Pyrex glass
reactor. A 500 W high-pressure Hg lamp equipped with a cutoff filter
(λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the light source, which was
positioned inside a cylindrical Pyrex vessel surrounded by a circulating
water jacket to cool the lamp. The Pyrex glass reactor was located
parallel to the Hg lamp to which 10 mL of the water suspension containing
5 mg of the prepared photocatalysts and 0.1 M L-ascorbic acid
was added. The pH value of the system was adjusted with 1 M NaOH aqueous
solution. The suspension was thoroughly deaerated before the photocatalytic
reaction took place. The amount of evolved H2 when exposing
the system to visible light irradiation was determined by analyzing
the gas compositions through Shimadzu GC-2010 Plus gas chromatograph
with the TCD detector.
