Efficiency of water oxidation catalysts
in terms of overpotential,
current density, and voltage stability over time with facile methods
of their fabrication remains a key challenge in developing competent
mechanisms of storing energy in the form of green hydrogen fuels.
In this work, a rapid one-step aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition
(AACVD) method is employed to synthesize amorphous and highly active
cobalt–vanadium mixed oxide catalysts (CoVOx) directly
over fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates. Morphological and
structural characterizations made by field emission scanning electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques revealed the formation
of pure-phase amorphous films with a gradual variation of topography
as a function of deposition time. Of these films, the most active
film (CoVOx-20) was obtained in 20 min deposition, showing
a spongy networking of interwoven nanofibers with a homogeneous distribution
of 3–4 nm pores, achieving an overpotential of 308 mV at 10
mA/cm2 current density. A much higher current density of
175 mA/cm2 could be achieved just at 380 mV of overpotential
with Tafel slope as low as 62 mV/dec for this whole range while exhibiting
long-term stability. Mass activity, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
data, and the estimation of electrochemically active surface area
all endorsed this high catalytic performance of CoVOx-20,
which is unprecedented for a low-cost, upscalable, and relatively
less conductive substrate such as FTO used here. Our findings, thus,
not only highlight the benefits of using AACVD in preparing two-dimensional
amorphous catalysts but also prove the high efficiency of CoVOx materials thus obtained, as outlined in a plausible reaction
mechanism.

==== Body
Introduction
Water-splitting reactions1 for generating
and storing clean energy2 in the form of
green hydrogen hold the key to fulfill rising global energy demands
and mitigate ever-increasing environmental concerns. A bottle neck
here is the four-electron oxygen evolution reaction (OER),3,4 which due to its sluggish kinetics and high overvoltage requires
highly active catalytic materials for an economically viable rate
of reaction.5 At the same time, these materials
need to be robust, efficient, and facile to be produced. Current benchmarks6 for water oxidation are IrO2 and RuO2, but these are based on scarce and costly noble metals, and
replacing them with earth-abundant materials7 is an active area of research.8,9

Although the approach
of developing these electrocatalysts mostly
remains empirical, some attempts to explore theoretical guidelines
have also been made.13,14 In one such purely descriptive
approach,10 the intrinsic activity of the
mixed metal oxide films is correlated to the M–OH bond strengths
using volcano plots. The outcome of this approach is quite debatable15,16 as it describes neither the physical origin nor the nature of the
active sites in the metal oxide films. However, it approximates the
superior catalytic activity of films like NiFeOx and CoFeOx explaining that Ni and Co are located on different branches
of the volcano plot as compared to Fe, thereby benefiting from the
balancing of M–OH bond strengths for higher catalytic activity.
An even better performance has been shown by CoVOx catalysts,17−19 especially the ones having amorphous character, with V located at
the same branch of the volcano plot as Fe while Co located at the
exactly opposite branch, as depicted in Figure 1. Thus, a recent trend is the facile, low-temperature,
and fast fabrication of Co–V mixed oxide films20,21 having amorphous character to provide inherent abundant defects
in the distinctive molecular structure. Accordingly, Liardet et al.12 synthesized amorphous electrocatalysts based
on Co–V mixed oxides with different metallic ratios while approximating
their position on the volcano plots and showed the highly active nature
of the resulting materials (e.g., a-Co0.58V0.42Ox) when deposited over glassy carbon electrodes and nickel
foams. Liu et al17 have also shown a similar
catalytic activity of amorphous Co–V hydr(oxy)oxide ultrathin
films when supported on gold foams. This has made us interested in
developing a facile and time-efficient method of fabrication of the
amorphous Co–V mixed oxide films, anticipating them to work
on conductive glass substrates rather than metallic foams, so as to
make them more viable for large-scale applications. Additionally,
the target is to attain competitive catalytic activity in terms of
overpotential and current density for OER with long-term stability.

refs (11) and (12).

Typically, two strategies are implemented in the rational
design
of amorphous catalytic materials: (i) the solid-state reaction (SSR)
route22,23 using pure metals or metal salts and (ii)
the wet chemistry synthetic methods such as hydrothermal synthesis12,24 or coprecipitation techniques.17,25 The SSR routes
are limited by a high-temperature processing and long reaction times
because of the long diffusion distances.26 Still, the procedure has a lesser control on the size and morphology
of the final product. Typically, SSR for cobalt vanadate is performed
at high temperatures of >720 °C for as many as 40 h using
vanadium
oxides and hydrated cobalt oxalates. On the other hand, the wet chemical
methods provide controllable synthesis and intriguing morphologies
with product formation occurring at relatively low temperatures, yet
requiring long reaction times and expensive instruments such as high-pressure
reactors. Further adding to this laborious work is the coating of
resulting products onto the substrates in separate manipulation steps.
Therefore, the scale up of the final product becomes a limiting factor
for these processes. An alternative and efficient strategy in this
regard can be aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD),
which can combine the benefits of both worlds, utilizing solution-based
precursors like wet chemistry and the deposition of the required materials
on preheated substrates of various kinds like SSR. AACVD is highly
effective in constructing bi-/multicomponent materials with precise
elemental stoichiometry and ensures the homogeneous coupling of the
bi- or triphases in a single step. During deposition via AACVD, the
particle growth and sintering processes simultaneously occur on the
substrate surface to develop well-interconnected morphological features
and produce adhesive film electrodes in a matter of minutes. Various
metal/metal oxide films have thus been fabricated for a range of applications
with time-dependent morphologies and enhanced photo/electrocatalytic
performance.27−29 Thus, it was envisaged that a similar protocol can
be followed to generate films of Co–V mixed oxide for effective
and stable water oxidation reaction.

For an experimental demonstration
of the hypothesis, the solution
of double precursors, i.e., cobalt(II) acetylacetonate and vanadium(III)
acetylacetonate, was used in AACVD and the growth patterns of Co–V
mixed oxide films were observed on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)
substrate as a function of time up to 60 min. The resulting films
were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, whereas
the catalytic performance of the film electrodes was evaluated toward
water oxidation using established protocols.

Results and Discussion
Scheme
of Synthesis with Structural and Morphological Analyses
The
schematic description for the fabrication of mixed metal oxide
films of cobalt and vanadium is provided in Figure S1. This fabrication was performed using an AACVD protocol,
the operation of which is critically related to the solubility of
the precursors in common organic solvents. Moreover, the precursor
solutions must be homogeneous, clear, and precipitation-free, especially
in the case of mixed metal oxides. Therefore, for the fabrication
of Co–V films, we chose acetylacetonate precursors of both
metals, which are commercially available and known for their higher
solubility in methanol without using any solubility-enhancing reagents
such as trifluoroacetic acid. With this selection of the same ligand
system for both metals, we ruled out the possibility of exchange reactions,
which may cause solution inhomogeneity with the passage of time. This
results in a superior particle–particle or particle–conducting
layer connection during direct deposition to force well-adhered films,
possibly on a variety of available substrates. The deposition of these
films was done directly on the FTO electrodes at a relatively low
temperature of 475 °C without any need of further immobilization
as in the case of hydrothermal synthesis, colloidal approaches, or
other wet chemistry protocols.31 Three
different films were prepared at deposition times of 20, 40, and 60
min, and this time is multiple orders lesser than that required for
wet chemistry protocols often needing 24–48 h for the reaction
to complete. These films were correspondingly named as CoVOx-20, CoVOx-40, and CoVOx-60.

Surface
morphology and the corresponding cross-sectional images of the prepared
films were investigated by FESEM, and the data is provided in Figure 2. Large-area analysis
of all of the films (a1, b1, and c1) shows a uniform and homogeneous
surface character, even for the extended deposition time up to 60
min. However, the morphology of the surface is getting varied as the
time of deposition increases. It is clearly seen that the CoVOx-20 film attains a spongy character with growth in all dimensions
(a1), which appeared to be a network of interwoven nanofibers stacked
over each other in a higher-resolution scan (a11). The pore size in
this case was found to be 3–4 nm with extremely homogeneous
distribution. Such a porous and high-surface-area structure provides
a higher access of the active sites to the reacting substrates and
is extremely useful for the electrocatalytic reactions. In the CoVOx-40 film, the networked surface structure has transformed
into nanoflakes (b11), which with further growth in the case of CoVOx-60 has changed into a thick continuous film with flakes protruding
out of it (c11). However, the imprints of the networked CoVOx-20 structure remained visible in other two films, showing a coalesced
growth. This growth pattern is consistent with our previous report32 highlighting the coalescence of structures over
the course of deposition times, forming larger entities. Therefore,
it can be concluded that the porous womblike structure self-propagated
into a dense thick layer of CoVOx. The cross-sectional
image of CoVOx-20 shows that a 1 μm thick film (a12)
has already been fabricated in just 20 min, which was then grown into
films of 3 and 4 μm thicknesses for CoVOx-40 (b12)
and CoVOx-60 (c12), respectively. However, this growth
pattern has not disrupted the homogeneity of the formed films, as
shown by continuous thickness of all of the cross sections.

min, (b) represents 40 min, and (c) represents 60 min of deposition
time, and low-resolution surface images (50 KX) are shown as (a1,
b1, c1), high-resolution surface images (100 KX) are shown as (a11,
b11, c11), and cross-sectional images (20 KX) are shown as (a12, b12,
c12).

Figure S2 demonstrates the XRD analysis
of all CoVOx films prepared on FTO substrates at 475 °C.
The diffractogram reveals the amorphous nature of all of the films
even for the extended deposition time of 60 min. Although the FTO
substrate is highly crystalline in nature, its crystalline peaks are
suppressed due to the noncrystalline profile of the prepared materials
in all cases. To confirm the amorphous nature of CoVOx,
the pristine films of CoOx and VOx were also
prepared under similar AACVD conditions using the individual precursors
(i.e., Co(acac)2 and V(acac)3) and their diffraction
patterns were obtained (Figure S3). These
patterns show crystalline peaks of individual CoOx and
VOx in pure forms. It is an indication that the mixed films
thus prepared are free of crystalline impurities of Co oxide and V
oxide besides proving that only the mixed material is amorphous in
nature. At the same time, this is quite in accordance with the previous
reports that present amorphous Co–V mixed oxide materials prepared
by hydrothermal methods and the coprecipitation technique,12,17 although the materials were synthesized at more vigorous conditions
of pressure or temperature. Thus, it can be concluded that being amorphous
is the inherent nature of mixed Co–V oxides, although the synthetic
schemes in all of the reports including our work are absolutely different.

The composition and elemental stoichiometry of all the films were
evaluated by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and the resulting spectra
are shown in Figure 3. This figure also contains the values of percentage atomicity for
both the metals in the films, and the Co/V ratio found in each case
is nearly equal to unity. These data are provided in tabulated form
in Table S1. Further, the presence of both
cobalt and vanadium elements in the film was ascertained by conducting
EDX mapping. Figure S4 indicates the uniform
distribution of Co and V elements in all of the films.

mixed oxide films fabricated in different
deposition time durations of (a) 20 min, (b) 40 min, and (c) 60 min
with higher-resolution images obtained via SEM.

The amorphous CoVOx-20 film was further characterized
by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to find out the oxidation
states of the constituent elements. The survey spectrum thus obtained
indicated the presence of Co 2p, V 2p, and O 1s in the film. The atomic
ratio of cobalt to vanadium (Co/V) determined by XPS is approximately
16.56: 15.95 (1:1) and is consistent with the metallic ratio of both
elements from EDX analysis. The high-resolution deconvoluted spectra
of these individual elements are provided in Figure 4. The binding energy of 781.1 eV of Co 2p
spectra can be fitted to Co+2 (Figure 4a). Moreover, two satellite peaks are indicated
at binding energies of 786 and 788 eV, which are characteristic of
high-spin Co2+. Contrarily, the V 2p spectrum has a peak
observed at 2p 3/2 (517.5 eV), which indicates the V+4 oxidation
state (Figure 4b).
Furthermore, the unsymmetrical O 1s peak can further be split into
three peaks. The high-resolution signals at binding energies of 531.5
eV and 530.0 eV in the O 1s spectrum represent oxygen atoms in the
hydroxyl group and oxide group, respectively, demonstrating a characteristic
feature of O that is bonded to a metal in metal oxides. The binding
energy peak at 532.3 eV is again a feature of oxygen atoms in the
carbonate group (Figure 4c). Although the XRD studies could not exactly reveal the chemical
formula of the deposited material due to the noncrystalline nature
of the fabricated material, on the basis of XPS studies, we can clearly
demonstrate the oxidation state of Co and V atoms existing in the
binary oxide system. These XPS studies also show a good agreement
with the CoVOx materials fabricated by other synthetic
strategies.12,18

Electrochemical Water Oxidation Studies
Directly deposited
amorphous catalytic films of CoVOx on the FTO substrates
were used for water oxidation studies without any further modification.
FTO substrates are much less conductive than the reported glassy carbon
electrode, nickel foam,12 carbon foam,18 and gold foam17 materials
used for CoVOx immobilization, but are less costly, easily
available, and scalable for large-area applications. The water oxidation
experiments were performed in 0.5 M KOH using a three-electrode configuration
under forward potential sweeps, and the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)
profiles were obtained. Figure 5 indicates these profiles for all three Co–V films
at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec. All of the data was compared at a current
density of 10 mA/cm2, which is often considered as a reference
for providing 10% efficiency in water-splitting reactions. Here, the
CoVOx-20 film showed a remarkable performance in terms
of the onset overpotential (i.e., 270 mV), overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 (i.e., 310 mV), and current density reaching a value of 160
mA/cm2 only at an overpotential of 410 mV. This catalytic
performance of CoVOx-20 is even higher compared to that
of other two films, which both show a similar onset potential but
have different overpotentials at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. A comparison of overpotential at a current density of 100
mA/cm2 indicates even better performance, as described
by Table S2. In our case, the curve rises
very quickly, obtaining this current density at just 370 mV of overpotential.
The octahedral cobalt vanadate material reported by Thorat et al.18 has this current density at about 550 mV. The
same work reported this current density to be obtained by RuO2 at 520 mV. Many other studies involving cobalt–vanadium
oxides have shown higher overpotentials for such high current density
as compared to materials proposed herein. Better performance of CoVOx-20 can be justified on the basis of the porous nanofiber
film structure indicated by SEM topography (Figure 2a,a1). This porous structure with spongy
appearance facilitated higher number of catalytic sites to be accessible
for the reaction to proceed. As a consequence, the overpotential is
reduced and the current density jumps to higher values at lower potentials.
With an increase in deposition time, the porosity of the film starts
deteriorating and the surface structure becomes more compact, as evident
from Figure 2b11. Thus,
less porous flakes of the material are formed, with an increase in
overpotential (i.e., 350 mV and 369 mV for CoVOx-40 and
CoVOx-60, respectively, as shown in the inset of Figure 4). The current densities
of these films were also shifted toward lower values. The performance
of the CoVOx-20 film was also compared to that of the materials
used for its formation and to that of the film structures reported
using other fabrication strategies. The overpotential for the CoVOx-20 film is much smaller than the reported values of individual
metal oxides of the combination and receeds many cobalt–vanadium
oxide catalysts, such as Co2V2O7 (340
mV),21 Co3V2O8 (359 mV),33 and Co3V2O8 nanoroses (391 mV).34 This value is also comparable to the values reported for
amorphous cobalt–vanadium oxide on glassy carbon (330 mV),12 nickel foam (260 mV),12 and gold foam (215 mV),17 although the
substrate used in here is FTO, which is much less conductive than
metallic foams. A notably higher current density is also achieved
without a substantial increase of overpotential in our case, which
makes this AACVD strategy much more simple and viable for catalyst
production.

Figure 5 Forward potential sweeps for fabricated mixed oxide electrocatalytic
materials in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution at the scan rate of 10
mV/sec. The inset shows the bar graph for the overpotential values
of the same films at a current density of 10 mA/cm2.

An effect of change in the scan
rate was also studied, which is
depicted in Figure 6 as subjected to the CoVOx-20 film. It was found that
the increasing scan rate from 1 to 100 mV/sec shifts the onset potential
to more negative potential values. However, there is no substantial
change in the overpotential for 10 mA/cm2 current density
as this value shifted from 310 mV at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec to 308
mV at a scan rate of 1.0 mV/sec. Notable here is that the current
densities are higher at low scan rates, reaching a value of 175 mA/cm2 for 1 mV/sec at an overpotential of just 380 mV. With a facile
and rapid synthetic strategy taking only minutes for the whole preparation
process, and keeping in view the less conductive behavior of the FTO
substrates, this water-splitting performance is quite remarkable.

Inset: a zoom-in for the water oxidation reaction at a scan rate of
1 mV/sec.

To study the sustainability and
the consistent rate of water oxidation
reaction, Tafel plots were drawn for all of the prepared catalyst
films within the linear regions of the current voltage curves at a
scan rate of 10 mV/sec and were fitted into the Tafel equation. This
analysis provides an indication whether the catalyst can operate over
a narrow potential range while producing high current density. A small
Tafel slope is an expression of well-balanced kinetics during catalysis.35 These plots with their slope values are shown
in Figure 7. All three
catalytic films presented here demonstrated the enhanced kinetics
while displaying an appreciably low value of Tafel slopes; however,
the film formed with 20 min deposition has a very large linear range
with a low slope of 75 mV/dec. The CoVOx-40 film also showed
a similar linear range but with a higher value of the slope (i.e.,
84 mV/dec). The CoVOx-60 film, on the other hand, starts
deviating from the linear range at a log value of 1.4 with a slope
of 149 mV/dec. The Tafel slope value for the CoVOx-20 film
at a scan rate of 1.0 mV/sec was even shifted to 62 mV/dec with a
linearity of response even beyond a logarithmic value of 2.2. This
indicates that the catalytic performance is dependent upon the porosity
and surface structure of the material and so is the kinetics of the
reaction, which is more visible at lower scan rates. An open structure
and porous morphological features of the CoVOx-20 film
catalyst support the fast mass transfer and boost electron transfer
without undergoing any scattering losses, as higher number of accessible
catalytic sites are readily available.

Figure 7 Tafel plots for different
films at a scan rate of 10 mV/sec as
well as the CoVOx-20 film at a scan rate of 1.0 mV/sec
in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution.

For a quantitative analysis of the film properties, mass
activities
of the catalytic films were determined at 1.55 V vs reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE), as provided in Table S2. This data is also corroborating to the Tafel plots where the smaller
Tafel slopes are linked to the higher mass activity in the same order.
The higher mass activity of the CoVOx-20 film (i.e., 43.4
A/g) as compared to the other two films further demonstrates the high
mass performance of 20 min deposition of the material. Here, a longer
deposition and higher mass loading is not creating the catalytic activity;
rather, the microstructure of the film and the available catalytic
sites are responsible for the OER. For an estimation of the available
catalytic sites, the measurement of the active surface area can be
regarded as an important factor, which was numerically assessed from
the double-layer capacitance measurements. For that purpose, charging
current density differences in a potential window of the non-Faradaic
region were plotted against scan rates (Figure S5) and the slopes were divided with the electrode area to
get estimated electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) values
in mF/cm2. A significantly higher linear slope value of
the CoVOx-20 film (i.e., 16.87 mF/cm2) as compared
to that of CoVOx-40, which has a value of 10.12 mF/cm2, and of CoVOx-60, which has a value of 7.06 mF/cm2, indicates that the prior film has a higher number of active
sites available, thereby making the catalytic reaction kinetically
favorable.

The conductivities of the sample films were estimated
using impedance
spectroscopy, showing a characteristic depressed semicircle of an
OER charge-transfer reaction for all of the films. However, it was
found that the CoVOx-20 film exhibits highest conductivity,
which is an indication of its lowest charge-transfer resistance compared
to other two films, as detailed in Figure S6. If we compare this resistance to that of the materials immobilized
on gold foam (i.e., 10–25 Ω),17 nickel foam (i.e., 1.0–1.4 Ω),12 glassy carbon (i.e, 0.6–0.8 Ω),12 and carbon foam (4.0–8.0 Ω),18 it is at least 10 times higher because of direct deposition
on the FTO substrate. The conductivity of the substrate plays a hugely
significant role in the electrocatalysis reactions such as water oxidation
in our case by facilitating or hindering the transport of electrons.
Metallic substrates can be very easy to work with, in such cases,
thereby resulting in a low overpotential and higher electron density.
This was actually the reason we selected this FTO substrate to indicate
that the prepared materials can provide a comparable electrocatalytic
performance even with lesser conductive substrates. When it comes
to the cost of the materials, FTO substrates are again beneficial,
and the cost is at least 10 times lesser than that of the Au-foam
and Ag-foam-based substrates or other precious metal substrates. It
is even much less than that of many non-noble metal foam substrates
such as those of Co-foam, Cu-foam, Ti-foam, graphene foam, or carbon
foams. It is also a bit lower than that of cheaper metal foams such
as Ni-foam, which can be used for further studies of these catalytic
materials. Thus, the method of AACVD can be regarded as highly efficient
for water oxidation chemistry. Among the three AACVD films, the higher
conductivity of the CoVOx-20 film may have been originated
from its thinner structure with a network of fibers having an enhanced
number of active sites available. The larger number of catalytic sites
transform more and more of the cobalt species into their active form,
in real time during the catalysis, thus promoting the charge-transfer
process. Consequently, the conductivity as well as the catalytic performance
of this film is highly improved.

In addition to the enhanced
catalytic activity with low conducting
substrates, the CoVOx films also exhibited highly desirable
catalytic durability and stability. For more than 5 h constant anodic
polarization in each case of 20 and 100 mA/cm2 current
density, only a moderate increase in the overpotential of 10–30
mV was required for all three fabricated films (Figure 8). This nominal shift in the overpotentials
is caused by the accumulation of very high density of oxygen covering
the active sites at the electrode surface. Bubbles in the form of
a rich continuous stream of oxygen was also visible during the electrocatalytic
experiments owing to the high rate of oxygen production at these electrodes.
Moreover, the CoVOx-20 electrode exhibited only a little
loss of activity after 500 CV cycles as shown in the inset of Figure 8. All of these performance
parameters of the fabricated films can only be attributed to their
excellent catalytic activity under the employed conditions.

tests of the prepared films at constant current
densities of 20 and 100 mA/cm2. Inset: the first and 500th
scan of the LSV measurement with no apparent changes in overvoltage
and current density.

All of the above measurements as well as the previous knowledge
of our own work29 and work of others17,19 assisted us in proposing a plausible mechanism of the catalytic
process, which defines the role of vanadium moieties in the system.
As shown in Figure 9, whether V is present or absent, the first few steps of the process
are same, which involve the activation of Co sites in the alkaline
medium. The reaction may begin with the adsorption of water and discharge
of hydrogen and electrons to form adsorbed hydroxyl groups on the
surface. These hydroxyl groups may react with more hydroxyl ions under
the forward potential sweep, thereby leaving the oxygen atoms adsorbed
onto the film substrate. In the absence of V, the reaction continues
with the generation of OOH groups at the surface, which is considered
as the rate-limiting step. Then, in the next step, a water molecule
detaches from the surface, leaving behind an oxygen molecule adsorbed on the surface.
This oxygen is then removed, completing the oxygen evolution reaction
in the last step. However, in the presence of V, which is capable
of switching its ground state, thereby modifying metal–metal
and antibonding interactions in the catalytic cluster, the adsorbed
oxygen species on the surface can form oxobridged entities among the
neighboring oxygen atoms. This scheme of operation benefits the catalytic
reaction in two ways. First, this oxobridged state is relatively more
active, which leads to a thermodynamically facile generation of a
hydroperoxo intermediate and kinetically faster O–O bond formation,
although it still remains a rate-limiting step. Second, the oxobridged
entities can also act as a catalyst, facilitating the reactions forming
adsorbed hydroxyl and isolated oxygen species on the catalytic site.
Thus, a favorable catalytic cycle is achieved, leading to a better
performance of mixed oxide films. The presence of V in Co-oxide materials
has also been shown to have a decreased overpotential at Co-active
sites adjacent to V. However, the V-active sites show an increased
overpotential. This is exactly corresponding to the volcano plots
described earlier that a mixed oxide configuration can stabilize the
bond strength and decrease the overpotential. This enhanced catalytic
impact of V on the neighboring Co atoms can be ascribed to the coordination
environment of the Co atom and its modification caused by the lattice
mismatch when V atoms are also present nearby. In this manner, the
Co-active sites can attain optimal water oxidation energies and enhanced
activity of OER catalysis is achieved.

Conclusions
Amorphous
CoVOx films fabricated in this work have shown
a highly efficient catalytic character as predicted by the descriptive
approach using the volcano plot while proving our hypothesis that
the acetylacetonate precursors of both the component metals would
generate a homogeneity in solution and in the final product formed
via AACVD. Further, the target of obtaining well-adhered and uniform
films of all of the materials was achieved directly on the substrate
surfaces with changing morphological and catalytic characters with
variations in deposition times. The CoVOx-20 film due to
its peculiar networked structure exposing a larger number of catalytic
sites, its high mass activity, larger ECSA, and low charge-transfer
resistance demonstrated lower overpotential, higher current density,
and lower Tafel slope as compared to CoVOx-40 and CoVOx-60. These numbers were also comparable to a couple of CoVOx materials yet reported, however, a clear advantage was the
formation of easily scalable films in just 20 min with one-step procedure
without any immobilization required. Moreover, the deposition of CoVOx films on less conductive FTO substrates with such a high
catalytic activity is unprecedented, which will pave the way for building
and understanding new catalytic materials, using them in various applications
besides water-splitting reactions, and then moving toward commercial
products.

was achieved through the AACVD method. All chemicals were obtained
from Sigma Aldrich and were used as received: cobalt(II) acetylacetonate
(Co(acac))2 and vanadium(III) acetylacetonate (V(acac)3) methanol (99.9%), and nitrogen gas (99.99%). The synthesis
of Co/V oxide films in 1:1 stoichiometry was achieved by dissolving
500 mg (0.19 mmol) of Co(acac)2 and 500 mg (0.14 mmol)
of V(acac)3 in methanol (20 mL) in a Schlenk tube connected
with a vacuum line. The transparent dark brown solution was kept stirring
for 30 min, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure
to give a brown solid, which was re-dissolved in methanol (10 mL).
The transparent solution was further stirred for 10 min and was used
in AACVD for film deposition. Prior to the deposition, the FTO glass
substrate was cut to an area of 1.0 × 2.0 cm2 (W ×
L) and sequentially washed using soapy water, acetone, and ethanol.
The substrate was then laid horizontally inside the reactor tube and
heated up to the deposition temperature of 475 °C for 10 min
to stabilize the temperature before carrying out the deposition. An
aerosol mist of the precursor solution was generated using a piezoelectric
ultrasonic humidifier. Nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas to transport
the aerosol to the heated substrate at a rate of 120 cm3/min. The reactor exhaust was vented into a fume hood. When the precursor
solution and associated aerosol mist had been completely emptied from
the flask, the coated substrate was cooled under a continuous flow
of N2 gas, until the temperature was below 40 °C before
it was removed from the reactor. The deposition experiments were carried
out for different time periods such as 20, 40, and 60 min, and resultant
film electrodes are named CoVOx-20, CoVOx-40,
and CoVOx-60, respectively.

Film Characterization
The structural properties of
cobalt–vanadium oxide thin films were analyzed by recording
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns using a PANanalytical, X’PertHighScore
diffractometer with primary monochromatic high-intensity CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. The surface micrographs of
the films were examined using Lyra 3 Tescan, field emission gun (FEG)-SEM
at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV and a working distance of 10 mm.
The Co/V atomic ratios were determined by an energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX, INCA Energy 200, Oxford Inst.) spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using ULVAC-PHI Quantera II with
a 32-channel spherical capacitor energy analyzer under vacuum (1 ×
10–6 Pa) using monochromatic Al Kα radiation
(1486.8 eV) with a natural energy width of 680 meV. The carbonaceous
C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as a reference to calibrate the binding
energies.

Electrochemical Measurements
All of the electrochemical
measurements were performed on a computer-controlled AUTOLAB potentiostat
employing CoVOx thin film electrodes as the working electrode.
A Pt wire shaped into a spiral (thickness = 0.25 mm) was used as the
counter electrode, and saturated silver–silver chloride (Ag/AgCl
in saturated solution of KCl) was used as the reference electrode.
For long-term electrocatalysis, a saturated calomel (Hg/HgO) reference
electrode was employed in 0.5 M KOH solutions. However, all of the
potentials are referred to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
following the Nernst equation.  Before placing into the electrochemical cell,
the platinum wire was cleaned by immersing in a 20% solution of HNO3 for few minutes following washing with Milli-Q water. All
of the glassware and electrochemical cells were cleaned by boiling
in a 1:3 mixtures of H2SO4 and HNO3 followed by boiling in water. They were then carefully rinsed with
acetone and dried by keeping in an oven at 100 °C for 1 h as
described previously.30 Electrochemical
investigations such as cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS), and controlled potential bulk electrolysis experiments
were performed in 0.5 M KOH electrolyte solution having the pH ≈
13.6. Water used to make all of the solutions for electrochemical
studies was distilled and deionized using the Milli-Q system from
Millipore. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to find the overpotentials
and current density profiles of the films during the water oxidation
reaction, whereas the charge-transfer resistances were determined
by EIS. The details of measurement parameters such as the calculation
of mass activity and the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)
are provided in the Supporting Information.
