Currently, biochar
(BC) has shown promising potential in groundwater
and surface-water remediation. In this work, Trapa
natans husks based biochar (TBC) was prepared and
modified with aquatic animal waste (shrimp and crab) to produce shrimp-modified
biochar (SBC) and crab-modified biochar (CBC), respectively. The as-prepared
BCs (TBC, SBC, and CBC) were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning
electron microscopy, elemental analysis, Boehm titration, Fourier
transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. SBC and
CBC had more developed nitrogen-containing functional groups than
TBC, which indicates that the crude proteins in shrimp and crab have
successfully achieved in situ nitrogen doping. Results of batch experiments
showed that SBC and CBC had larger groundwater pollutants (2,4-dichlorophenol
(2,4-DCP) and Ni(II)) adsorption capacities than TBC. According to
batch adsorption experiment and characterization analysis results,
the proposed adsorption mechanism of 2,4-DCP includes hydrogen bonding
and π–π electron–donor–acceptor interaction,
while the mechanism for Ni(II) adsorption are proposed to be surface
complexation, ion exchange, and electrostatic attraction.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
increasingly developed industrial and agricultural production
has not only brought a more convenient life to human beings but also
led to worldwide environmental pollution, among which water pollution
has become a major concern. The rapid growth of population, along
with the worldwide water crisis, has made the preservation of groundwater
and surface-water vital issue. Ni(II) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP)
are both typical pollutants in groundwater and surface-water. As one
of the most widely distributed heavy metal pollutants in the environment,
Ni(II) mainly comes from industries including machine manufacturing,
ceramic pigment, and electronic remote control. The compounds of Ni(II)
are carcinogenic to humans, so the international agency for research
on cancer of the World Health Organization has added Ni(II) compounds
to its list of carcinogens in 2017.1,2 2,4-Dichlorophenol
(2,4-DCP), as herbicide synthetic precursor, has been widely used
in agricultural production. It can cause the disorder of bilayer phospholipid
structure of human cells, further leading to cancer and mutagenesis,
so the maximum allowable concentration of phenol in water source is
0.093 mg/L.3,4 Herein, the development of a highly efficient
adsorption technology for both pollutants has become a focus of groundwater
and surface-water remediation research.

Biochar (BC) is a kind
of porous carbonaceous solid produced by
thermal or hydrothermal pyrolysis of biomass (natural plant materials,
industrial and agricultural waste, etc) at anaerobic atmosphere and
relatively low temperatures (<700 °C) for environmental applications.5,6 BC could be used as soil conditioner, reductant, carrier of slow
release fertilizer, carbon dioxide fixing agent, etc.7,8 Some studies have been done to evaluate the application of biochar
as an adsorbent in water treatment to remove various pollutants, including
heavy metals and organic pollutants.9 However,
the high cost remains a major obstacle to the large-scale application
of biochar in wastewater treatment. Thus, it is necessary to develop
an affordable and green absorbent with excellent physicochemical properties.
Biochar contains plenty of polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl,
carboxylic, and amino groups,10 thus providing
a good potential for its modification. So far, the discussed modification
methods of biochar include (1) the loading of metal ions, oxides,
or ions;11,12 (2) mixing with reducing or oxidizing salt;13 and (3) modification with other specific organic
functional groups.14 Modification of plant-based
biochar by aquatic animal waste could change the number and types
of oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing surface functional groups
of the biochar, leading to improvements of its performance for the
adsorption of pollutants. Moreover, the utilization of aquatic animal
waste as an economical and green material will provide an alternative
way for the large-scale production of modified biochar.15

Trapa natans is a widely distributed
aquatic plant in China, whose husks contain a large amount of lignin
and cellulose. Tons of T. natans husk
were burned or discarded annually just in the Taihu Lake area in China,
causing great threat to the growth of the local aquatic organisms.16 The carbon content of T. natans husk is approximately 50%, offering an ideal basis for biochar preparation. T. natans husks based biochar (TBC) with developed
specific surface area, pore structure, and surface functional groups
has been extensively studied.17,18 By this means, the
abundantly existing biomass material could be better utilized and
the relative environmental impacts caused by burning could be avoided
as well.

Shrimp and crab powder are both common aquatic animal
wastes with
a large output. China produces about 60,000 tons of shrimp annually,19,20 of which chitin and crude protein are the main components. To the
best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted so far using shrimp
bran and crab powder to modify T. natans husks based biochar to explore the performance and removal mechanism
of typical groundwater pollutants.

The overall objectives of
this study was to prepare modified T. natans husks based biochar from aquatic animal
waste (shrimp and crab) and evaluate its efficiency in removing 2,4-DCP
and Ni(II) from aqueous solution. The specific objectives are as follows:
(1) to prepare and characterize SBC (shrimp modification), CBC (crab
modification), and TBC (pure T. natans husks based biochar); (2) to determine the effects of pH, contact
time, and initial pollutant concentration on pollutant removal; and
(3) to further discuss the pollutants removal mechanisms of SBC and
CBC through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), and batch adsorption experiment.

2 Results
2.1 Doping Ratio Optimization of Animal Waste
As displayed in Figure 1, for both biochar samples, the adsorption capacities on 2,4-DCP
first increased and then decreased with the increasing doping ratio
of shrimp bran and crab. The biochar samples for experiments were
selected according to the maximum adsorption capacity of 2,4-DCP in
this experiment, so the TBC, SBC-1.0 (referred to as SBC in the following
discussion), and CBC-1.0 (referred to as CBC in the following discussion)
were selected for subsequent experiments.

Figure 1 Optimization of doping
ratio (animal wastes: TH).

2.2 Textural Characteristics of Biochar
The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of BCs are shown in Figure S1. According to Figure S1, the surfaces of BCs were rough and had developed pores
of different sizes and irregular structures, which is conducive to
improving their adsorption characteristics.21 The pore density of SBC and CBC is higher than that of TBC, resulting
in a higher SBET and Vtot (cm3/g) of the two samples, which is in
accordance with the data in Table 1. Table 1 also shows that Smic/Stot (%) and Vmic/Vtot (%) of TBC were higher than that of SBC and CBC, which
is possible because animal waste calcination and collapse resulted
in smaller micropores ratio in SBC and CBC.22Figure 2a shows that
the main distribution range of the pore size was 1–5 nm. For
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm in Figure 2a, inset, capillary condensation
and hysteresis of isotherms (in higher P0/Ps) shows that the isotherm is of I
and IV hybrid according to the IUPAC, so the pore size distribution
was dominated by the microporous structure.23 In general, doping with a small amount of animal waste did not change
the physical properties of biochar in a large area but slightly improved
its physical adsorption properties.

CBC	1415.43	417.86	29.52	1.541	0.162	10.51	
The XRD patterns of
the BC samples are shown in Figure 2b. No obvious diffraction peak
is detected in the whole range, indicating that the BCs is of amorphous
structure. Additionally, the greater peak strength of SBC and CBC
in the 0–25° range was attributed a higher crystallinity
than that of TBC.24 In general, the physical
characteristics of SBC and CBC were similar to those of TBC, implying
that the doping of animal wastes did not lead to a remarkable change
in biochar.

2.3 Chemical Characteristics
of Biochar
The infrared spectra (400–4000 cm–1) of
BCs are presented in Figure 3a. All the three samples exhibited 5 similar peaks: peak (I)
represents the characteristic peak related to aromatic structure (600–800
cm–1); peak (II) is related to C–O (epoxy,
hydroxyl and carboxylic groups), C–N, and C–C (1020–1300
cm–1); peak (III) is the typical characteristic
peak of C=O (conjugated carbonyl group) and C=N (amide
group) (1420–1480 cm–1); peak (IV) corresponds
to C=O (carboxyl or lactone groups) (1510–1615 cm–1); and peak (V) is related to −OH (hydroxyl
groups) and −NH2 (3415–3442 cm–1).25,26 The transmittance corresponding to different
peaks indicated that the doping of shrimp bran and crab obviously
changed the chemical properties of biochar.

before (a) and after (b) 2,4-DCP adsorption.

Boehm titration was used for further quantitative analysis of functional
groups, and the results are shown in Table 2. The total base amount of SBC and CBC were
higher than that of TBC, indicating that the doping of shrimp bran
and crab improved the chemical properties of biochar.27 The results of elemental analysis (Table 2) further confirmed that the doping of animal
crude protein increased the N content of SBC and CBC. Table 2 also shows that the total amounts
of acid groups in BCs were higher than that of the base groups, which
agreed well with the results of isoelectric point analysis that the
isoelectric points of SBC and CBC were lower than that of TBC (Figure 4a), suggesting that
SBC and
CBC are more suitable for ion-exchange adsorption than TBC.28

XPS was employed to
identify the surface functional groups of BCs
as shown in Figure S2. C 1s (284 eV) and
O 1s (532 eV) were major peaks of BCs, and N 1s (400.52 eV) was also
introduced to the surface of SBC and CBC. C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s were
fitted to the peaks by XPS-PEAK software; the peak numbers and relative
content of the surface functional groups determined by C 1s, O 1s,
and N 1s spectra from XPS for BCs before and after Ni(II) and 2,4-DCP
adsorption are shown in Table 3. The major C 1s peak could be fit to three curves from the
following groups (Figure S3a,c,e): C-I
represents the sp2 imaging carbon peak (C–C or C–H)
(284.6–285.1 eV); C-II represents phenolic hydroxyl, alcoholic
hydroxyl, and ether groups (C–O) (286.31–286.5 eV);
and C-III represents −COOH (288.6–289.42 eV). The major
O 1s peak could be fitted to three curves from the following groups
(Figure 5a,c,e): O-I
represents carbonyl and quinone (C=O) (531.1 ± 0.3 eV);
O-II represents hydroxyl, ether, ester, and anhydride (532.3 ±
0.3 eV); and O-III represents carboxyl (−COOH) (535.1 ±
0.3 eV). The major N 1s peak could be fitted to two curves from the
following groups (Figure 6a,c): N5 represents pyrrole-like N (C-NH2, 400.3
± 0.3 eV) and NX represents pyridine-N-oxynitride
(C-NO2, 402.5–402.6 eV).29

For the TBC sample, the doping of shrimp bran and
crab improved
its chemical properties, namely, the introduction of nitrogen functional
groups, the increase in the total functional groups, and the decrease
of the isoelectric point value.

2.4 Adsorption
Kinetics
Figure S4 shows that
the adsorption capacity of 2,4-DCP and
Ni(II) on BCs increased with the extension of time. The adsorption
capacity increased rapidly in the initial stage of reaction, then
the increase became slow, and finally reached a dynamic equilibrium. Figure S4 and Table S1 show that the R2 for the pseudo-second-order equation were
larger than those for the pseudo-first-order equation, and Qcal is basically consistent with Qexp for the pseudo-second-order equation. Therefore, the
pseudo-second-order equation was more suitable to simulate the adsorption
of pollutants by BCs, indicating that the adsorption was a chemical
process.30

2.5 Adsorption
Isotherms
For the 2,4-DCP
adsorption in Figure S5a–c and Table S2, the R2 for the Freundlich isotherm
model were larger than those for the Langmuir isothermal model, and
the Qexp was more consistent with Qcal. The better fit of the Freundlich isotherm
model implied that the adsorption of 2,4-DCP by the BCs was mainly
a heterogeneous adsorption of multimolecular layers. Additionally, Qm, K1, and K2 all decreased with the increasing temperature,
which indicated that the adsorption of 2,4-DCP by BCs was an exothermic
process, and the increase of temperature hindered the decomposition
of organics by oxygen-containing functional groups.31

For Ni(II) adsorption, the Langmuir isothermal model
was more suitable for describing the thermodynamic properties of Ni(II)
adsorption, as displayed in Figure S5d–f and Table S2. The result showed that the Ni(II) adsorption
on BCs was mainly a monolayer specific site adsorption. In addition,
adsorption of Ni(II) by BCs was an endothermic process.32

Table S2 displays
the maximum adsorption
capacities of BCs, among which SBC (863.24 mg/g for 2,4-DCP and 44.78
mg/g for Ni(II)) has a higher adsorption capacity than CBC (728.69
mg/g for 2,4-DCP and 39.40 mg/g for Ni(II)) and TBC (589.35 mg/g for
2,4-DCP and 26.269 mg/g for Ni(II)) for both Ni(II) and 2,4-DCP.

2.6 Effect of pH on 2,4-DCP/ Ni(II) Adsorption
To explore the adsorption performance of pollutants on biochar
at different pH values, a certain amount of biochar samples was added
into a conical flask (150 mL) containing 50 mL of the pollutant solution
(2,4-DCP (200 mg/L); Ni(II) (30 mg/L)) with different pH values (2,4-DCP
(pH = 2–12); and Ni(II) (pH = 2–8)).

The ionization
degree of 2,4-DCP under different pH values conforms to eq 1(33,34) 1  where C0 is the
concentration of unionized 2,4-DCP, CT is the total concentration of 2,4-DCP, pH is the pH value after
adsorption equilibrium, and the value of pKa is 7.85.

Ni(II) can potentially exist as the species of Ni2+ (pH
< 8), Ni(OH)+, Ni(OH)20, Ni(OH)3–, and Ni(OH)42–, depending on the pH value.35

The
solution pH is one of the most important parameters influencing
the adsorption process, as pH not only affects the adsorbent surface
charge, functionalities, and adsorption site but also the ionization
degree and the existing form of pollutants.

For 2,4-DCP adsorption
in Figure 4b, the removal
efficiency of 2,4-DCP by BCs decreased
with the increasing pH value and the same results have been reported
in other literatures refs (31, 36). When the pH value of the solution was lower than pKa, most of the adsorption sites on the surface of BCs
were protonated and exhibited positive charges. In this case, 2,4-DCP
was neutral and there was attraction between the surface of biochar
and 2,4-DCP, thus the removal rate of 2,4-DCP was relatively high.37 As the pH of the solution increased, the ionization
degree of 2,4-DCP and 2,4-DCP anions increased, and the surface of
biochar was neutral or negatively charged, so the electrostatic repulsion
reduced the removal rate of 2,4-DCP. In addition, 2,4-DCP anions are
more water-soluble and likely to form stronger bonds with water molecules
in solution, so the removal efficiency of 2,4-DCP by biochar in an
alkaline medium was lower than that in the acidic medium.38

As shown in Figure 4c, the adsorption capacity for Ni(II) of
BCs increased rapidly in
the pH value range of 2.5–4.0 and then slowly increased in
the range of 3.5–8.0. In a medium of low pH value, the positive
charge of biochar is not conducive to the adsorption of Ni(II). On
the contrary, when the pH was high, biochar with a higher degree of
dissociation had a higher negative charge on the surface, and electrostatic
attraction promoted the adsorption process.39

2.7 Pollutant Adsorption Mechanism
Based
on the above results, although the textural performances of SBC and
CBC are not much different from that of TBC, the former two have better
adsorption capacities for Ni(II) and 2,4-DCP in comparison of TBC,
suggesting that the chemical properties of biochar (including surface
charges, functionalities, and adsorption sites) played an important
role in the adsorption process.

Figure 3 illustrates the FTIR spectra of the BCs
(TBC, SBC, and CBC), 2,4-DCP-adsorbed BCs (TBC-2,4-DCP, SBC-2,4-DCP,
and CBC-2,4-DCP). The appearance of peak (new peak) and changes in
transmittance indicate that 2,4-DCP has been loaded on the surface
of 2,4-DCP-adsorbed BCs. The transmittance corresponding to peaks
(II, III) of SBC-2,4-DCP and CBC-2,4-DCP slightly reduced as compared
with those on BC-2,4-DCP, which indicated that C–O (epoxy,
hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups) and C=O (conjugated carbonyl
group) participated in the adsorption reaction of biochar to 2,4-DCP.
The change of peak (V) also explained that the amino group may increase
the removal of 2,4-DCP. Possible reasons are proposed to explain this
phenomenon: (1) hydrogen bonding (H-bonding existed between 2,4-DCP
and O/N groups) and (2) π–π electron–donor–acceptor
(EDA) interaction (2,4-DCP and protonated C–O/C=O).40,41

Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the XPS spectra of the BCs (TBC, SBC,
and CBC) and Ni(II)-adsorbed BCs (TBC-Ni(II), SBC-Ni(II), and CBC-Ni(II)). Figure 5 shows that the binding
energy of peaks (C-II, C-III, O-II, and O-III) of TBC- Ni(II), SBC-Ni(II),
and CBC-Ni(II) had larger values than those on original BCs, and the
decrease of the relative content of the peaks after Ni(II) adsorption,
which indicated that O atom acted as an electron donor for Ni(II)
adsorption.42,43 This result can be explained
by the following equation reactions (2)–(5)44 2   3   4   5  As
shown in Figure 6,
the binding energies for the photoelectron
peaks appearance of N5 and NX increased and the relative content decreased,
which indicated that N acted as an electron donor during the Ni(II)
adsorption. This conclusion can be explained by the following equations
(6)–(8)32,45 6   7   8  The adsorption mechanism mainly involves
(1)
surface complexation (O/N atoms and Ni(II)); (2) ion-exchange (O/N
functional group protons and Ni(II)); and (3) electrostatic attraction
(deprotonated carboxylic and phenolic and Ni(II)) and chemical interactions.46

The maximum Ni(II) and 2,4-DCP adsorption
capacity of different
adsorbents found in the literature are shown in Table 4. Generally, SBC exhibited higher Qmax-Ni(II) and Qmax–2,4-DCP than other adsorbents,
which reflected that SBC could be a promising biochar for Ni(II) and
2,4-DCP removal. The cost of preparation of BCs is shown in Table S3.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the adsorption capacities (2,4-DCP and Ni(II)) of
the three biochars derived from T. natans husks are compared and the adsorption mechanism is proposed. The SBET and quantity of total functional groups
increased upon modification by shrimp and crab. The kinetics data
demonstrated that modification on BC by animal waste could enhance
the pollutant removal. For the three biochar samples, the Freundlich
model was the best to describe the equilibrium data. The adsorption
mechanism of 2,4-DCP mainly includes hydrogen bonding and π–π
EDA interaction, and the adsorption mechanism of Ni(II) mainly lies
in surface complexation, ion exchange, and electrostatic attraction.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
Plant
waste (T. natans husks, TH) was collected
from the Mata
Lake Constructed Wetland (Zibo, Shandong Province, China). Aquatic
animal waste (shrimp and crab) was collected from a seafood booth
in Shanghai, China. The plant and animal wastes were thoroughly cleaned
with distilled water and then dried at the oven (80 °C) to constant
weight. The dried wastes were crushed to 100 mesh. All the chemical
reagents used in this work were of analytical grade and purchased
from Guangdong Xilong Chemical Co., Ltd (China). The standard 2,4-DCP
and nickel chloride stock solution of 10 mmol/L were prepared by dissolving
the specific quality pollutants (2,4-DCP and nickel chloride) in distilled
water. Experimental solutions of desired concentration were configured
by diluting the stock solution with distilled water.

4.2 Preparation and Modification of Biochar
The preparation
method of biochar has been described in our previous
work. The TH (20.00 g) was mixed with aquatic animal waste (shrimp
(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 g) and crab powder (0, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 g)) at a specific doping ratio (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0, 2.5, 3.0%) and used as precursor samples for biochar production.
The precursor samples were impregnated in H3PO4 solution (85 wt.%) in a 500 ml vessel at a mass ratio of 1: 2.2
(precursor samples: H3PO4) for 12 h, where H3PO4 was used as an activator. Then, the mixed samples
were calcined at 500 °C for 1 h in a N2 atmosphere
(heating rate = 10 °C /min, flow rate =12 L /min).50 The obtained samples were subsequently soaked
in tap water (80–90 °C) and rinsed with purified water
to neutral (pH = 7). Finally, the samples were dried at 120 °C
for 6 h and crushed into powder (160–200 mesh). The unmodified
biochar samples and biochar samples modified with shrimp bran or crab
are denoted as TBC, SBC-r, or CBC-r, respectively, where r represents
the doping ratio (%).

4.3 Characterization of As-Prepared
Biochar Samples
(BCs)
The surface morphology of BCs was observed by SEM (Zeiss
Supra 40, Germany). Automatic specific surface area and pore size
analyzer (GEMINT VII 2390) was used to determine the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and pore structure of BCs. The crystal phase structure
was presented by an XRD diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance, Germany).
The surface functional groups were analyzed and quantified by FTIR
(Nicolet-460, Thermo Fisher) and Boehm titration (Supporting Information).27 The
elemental contents of C, N, O, and H in BCs were determined by elemental
analysis (Flash 2000, Thermo Fisher).51 Point of zero charge (PZC) is used to determine the surface charge
of BCs.28 XPS analysis (Nicolet 460, Thermo
Fisher) was conducted to determine the binding energy between electrons
and characterize the elements on the surface of BCs.

4.4 Adsorption Experiments
4.4.1 Solution Configuration
and Measurement
The concentration of 2,4-DCP was determined
by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (UV-5100, Shanghai) at the wavelength of 281 nm.52 The concentration of Ni(II) was determined by
an ICP-OES analyzer (iCAP6300, Thermo).53 The adsorption capacity Qe (mg/g) and
removal rate (%) of BCs were calculated by 9   10  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial concentration of the pollutants, Ce (mg/L) is the equilibrium solution concentration, V is the volume of solution (L), and M is
the mass of BCs (g) employed.

4.4.2 Adsorption
Kinetics Experiments and Kinetic
Model
Pollutant solutions with specific concentration (2,4-DCP
(200 mg/L) and Ni(II) (30 mg/L)) were configured in a 2 L beaker and
stirred with a magnetic stirrer (400 rpm). Certain amounts of BCs
were added to the solution (2,4-DCP (0.60 gBCs) and Ni(II) (1.00 gBCs))
and the time was set as the starting point of the kinetic experiments.
Then, 20 mL of solution samples were taken at a desired time interval
within the set time range (0–24 h). The solution sample was
filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane, and the residual concentration
of pollutants was detected using the method described in Section 4.4.1.

The pseudo-first-order eq 11 shows that the adsorption rate is affected by the concentration
of the solution and the adsorption capacity, while mass transfer resistance
is the limiting factor of adsorption.54 The pseudo-second-order eq 12 shows that the limiting factor of adsorption is the adsorption
mechanism rather than the mass transfer within particles.55 11   12  where qe and qt are the amounts of
pollutants adsorbed at
equilibrium and time t (mg/g), respectively, and k1 (1/h) and k2 (g/(mg
min)) are the rate constants of the pseudo-first-order equation and
pseudo-second-order equation, respectively.

4.4.3 Adsorption
Isotherm
A certain amount
of BCs was added into a conical flask (150 mL) containing pollutant
solution (50 mL) with different concentration gradients (2,4-DCP (80–130
mg/L), Ni(II) (80–130 mg/L)). The conical flask was then shaken
for 24 h in the oscillator under different temperatures (288.15, 303.15,
and 318.15 K). Finally, the concentration of the remaining pollutant
solution was determined.

The Langmuir isotherm equation (13)56,57 describes the monolayer adsorption
of the adsorbent. The Freundlich isotherm equation (14)58 considers that adsorption is
multilayer adsorption and there are many interactions between adsorbents
and adsorbents 13   14  where qe (mg/g)
and Ce (mg/L) are the solid-phase and
aqueous-phase concentrations, respectively. At adsorption equilibrium, Q0 (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity. KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant. KF (mg1–1/n L1/ng–1) and n are
the Freundlich constants related to the adsorption capacity and intensity,
respectively.
