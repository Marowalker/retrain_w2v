Bis(2-aminoethyl)terephthalamide,
an amide-containing diamine,
was obtained from the aminolysis of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate)
bottles. This diamine reacts with various aromatic dianhydrides to
form novel polyamideimides (PAIs). The formation of amic acid or ammonium
carboxylate salt intermediates depends strongly on the substituents
of the dianhydrides. The electron-withdrawing substituents promote
the creation of an ammonium carboxylate salt, whereas the electron
donors assist with the amic acid intermediate formation. These salts
and amic acids were further converted into polyimides by thermal treatment.
The structures of the intermediates and PAIs were characterized by
Fourier transform infrared, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), and 13C NMR spectroscopies, and their thermal properties
were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry.
X-ray diffraction patterns and inherent viscosity values of these
PAIs were also reported. By using these chemical transformations,
waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) bottles were converted into high-performance
PAIs. These PAIs can be used as membrane-modifying agents for industrial
separation applications.

1 Introduction
Polyimide
(PI) is one of the high-performance polymers. It exhibits
excellent thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, and consequently,
it has been widely used in aerospace, electronics, and other industries.1−9 PI can be copolymerized with a polyamide. The commercial polyamideimide
(PAI) with the brand name of TorlonVR 4000TF has the superior properties
of both polyamides and PIs, such as high mechanical strength, thermal
resistance, and wide chemical resistance; hence, there are many developments
for its application, including gas separation, nanofiltration, osmotic
power generation, pervaporation, and so forth.10 PAI (Torlon) can also be used as the modification agent
for cellulose acetate membranes11 or polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) fibrous porous membranes.12 The
prepared PAI-reinforced membranes have potential in industrial separation
applications. In addition, PAI was used in composites, such as Nylon-12/PAI
composite coatings.

Some key methods are used to prepare PAI:
(i) condensation of an
imide-containing diacid with a diamine,13−21 (ii) condensation of an amide-containing diamine with a dianhydride,22−24 and (iii) thermal imidization of a polyamide–amic acid (AA).25

Bis(2-aminoethyl)terephthalamide (BAET)
is a diamine containing
a terephthalamide moiety. This diamine was prepared by the aminolysis
of waste poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles with ethylenediamine.26 This is a short and cost-effective approach
to prepare an amide-containing diamine compared to the two-step22 or four-step23 methods
from monomers.

In this study, by the transformation of BAET
into a novel PI, we
can use waste PET bottles as a source of materials and hence contribute
to the chemical methods of recycling waste materials. Therefore, the
outcome of this study is the finding of a new environment-friendly
approach to recycle PET into novel monomers/oligomers that are potential
raw materials for preparing other new polymers (PIs) to attain useful
products with special performance and properties.

2 Results and Discussion
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectrum of BAET (Figure 1a) is identical to
the published data.26 This diamine was
used for PI preparation.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) BAET, (b) AC-BAET-PMDA,
and (c) PI-BAET-PMDA.

When an input molar ratio
of BAET-pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA)
of 1:1 or 2:1 was used in dried dimethyl acetamide (DMAc), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or
glacial acetic acid, the same intermediate was isolated and characterized
by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy techniques. The common absorption bands
of AA could not be found in the FTIR spectrum of the intermediate
(Figure 1b), but only
the existence of an ammonium carboxylate (AC) salt was observed. For
example, the comparison of the FTIR spectra of BAET (Figure 1a) with AC-BAET-PMDA (Figure 1b) showed that the
weak band at 1577 cm–1 in BAET became stronger.
This band is characteristic for the asymmetric CO2– stretch. In addition, the C=O amide stretching
band of BAET at 1632 cm–1 shifted to a lower wavenumber
at 1623 cm–1 because of the existence of the NH3+ asymmetric deformation band that used to appear
in the range of 1625–1560 cm–1.27

The structure of the AC salt (Scheme 1) obtained from BAET
and PMDA was also confirmed
by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. DMSO-d6 was used as a good solvent for this intermediate. The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S1) shows
two triplets at 3.03 and 3.53 ppm of four symmetrical methylenes,
one singlet at 7.95 ppm of four aromatic terephthalate protons, and
one singlet at 8.95 ppm of two aromatic pyromellitic protons. The
difference in the resonance signals of the methylene protons of AC-BAET-PMDA
is 0.50 ppm. Two methylene triplets of the BAET reactant appear at
3.41 and 3.83 ppm in CD3COOD,26 and the difference is 0.42 ppm. If an AA intermediate was formed,
the methylene protons of the BAET moiety would appear at very close
chemical shifts because these methylene protons were alpha hydrogens
of the amide.

Such as PMDA,
BTDA, and OPDA, to Form the AC Salt, AA Intermediates, and PI Final
Product
In addition, 13C
NMR of AC-BAET-PMDA in DMSO-d6 (Figure S2) shows
the carbon signals of the bisethylene terephthalamide part at 167.4
(C=O), 135.8 (ipso C), 127.3 (arom C–H), 38.7, and 37.3
ppm (CH2) and of the pyromellitic part at 166.3 (C=O),
137.6, and 136.4 ppm (arom CH and ipso C).

The thermal properties
of AC-BAET-PMDA were investigated by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG). The first heating
curve of DSC (Figure 2a) shows an endothermic peak at 274 °C. After cooling to room
temperature (RT) and reheating, this peak disappears. This means that
an endothermic chemical reaction occurred at 274 °C.

Figure 2 DSC curves
of AC-BAET-PMDA: (a) heating from RT to 320 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min and holding for 5 min at 320 °C;
(b) cooling to RT at 50 °C/min; and (c) heating from RT to 320
°C at 10 °C/min.

The derivative thermogravimetric (dTG) curve of AC-BAET-PMDA (Figure 3) shows two well-defined
decomposition steps with the peaks at 262 and 503 °C. By comparison
with the DSC endothermic peak at 274 °C (Figure 2), the first decomposition step is assigned
to water elimination of the AC salt to form a PI. The second step
is due to the decomposition of the newly formed PI.

Figure 3 TG and dTG curves of
AC-BAET-PMDA heating from RT to 800 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min.

The theoretical mass loss by the removal of four molecules of water
from AC-BAET-PMDA (Scheme 1) to form the corresponding PI can be calculated by the following
equation  

On the contrary, the formation of PI from AA requires the loss
of only two water molecules or 7.7%.

From RT to 200 °C,
the TG curve (Figure 3) shows an initial loss of 1.1%, which is
due to moisture. In the temperature range of 200–290 °C
with a dTG peak at 262 °C, the mass loss because of condensation
and imide ring formation is 14.8%. These experimental and theoretical
values are identical, and therefore, this is additional evidence for
the structure of AC salt and its conversion into PI.

The newly
formed PI begins to decompose at approximately 350 °C
and reaches a maximum decomposition rate at 503 °C with a total
weight loss of 64.8%.

From the above FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DSC,
and TG analyses, we can conclude that under the reaction conditions,
by using various solvents, such as dried DMAc, NMP, DMSO, and glacial
acetic acid, BAET reacts with PMDA to form an AC salt but not an AA.
The required temperature for thermal treatment to convert this AC
salt into PI is from 262 to 300 °C.

A patent of Kikuchi28 has also reported
that when highly basic diamines are used, a salt is produced by the
neutralization reaction before forming a poly(amic acid) at the point
that the alicyclic diamines are mixed with acid dianhydrides and precipitated.
BAET is an aliphatic diamine that is a stronger base than an aromatic
diamine, and therefore, an AC salt is formed.

The transformation
of the solid salt AC-BAET-PMDA into the corresponding
PI was performed by stepwise heating from 100 to 300 °C with
20 °C increments, and the duration of each step was 30 min. The
FTIR spectrum of the obtained PI-BAET-PMDA (Figure 1c) exhibits absorptions at 1775, 1712 cm–1 (C=O of N-aliphatic imide), 1396 cm–1 (aliphatic C–N), 1156, and 727 cm–1 (imide
ring deformation). The terephthalamide moiety is observed at 3405
cm–1 (stretching of amide N–H), 1640 cm–1 (stretching of amide C=O), and 1540 cm–1 (deformation of amide N–H).

The TG and
dTG curves (Figure 4) show that the obtained PI is stable from RT to 400
°C with a maximum degradation temperature Tdm at 514 °C.
At 800 °C, the residue is 10.1%. This Tdm is not different
from the one of the second decomposition step of AC-BAET-PMDA (Figure 3). This Tdm value is
much higher than that at 410 °C of the N-aliphatic arimide prepared
by Mallakpour et al.29 from N,N′-(pyromellitoyl)-bis-l-leucine
diacid chloride and aromatic diamine.

Figure 4 TG and dTG curves of PI-BAET-PMDA heating
from RT to 800 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min.

The presence of short aliphatic ethylene in diamine does not significantly
reduce the thermal stability of PI-BAET-PMDA, but the existence of
an imide moiety in the chain increased its thermal stability compared
to the corresponding polyamide. The decomposition peak of poly(ethylene
terephthalamide) was reported at 44126 or
430 °C.30

The PAI preparation
procedure and characterization, as described
above, were also applied similarly to prepare PIs from BAET and 3,3′,4,4′-benzophenonetetracarboxylic
dianhydride (BTDA) or 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (OPDA).
The 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S3) of the intermediate isolated from the reaction of BAET with BTDA
in DMSO showed complex structures that were identified as a mixture
of AA and AC. The methylene protons appear as two pairs of peaks at
(i) 3.51 and 3.01 ppm of AC and (ii) 3.48 and 3.40 ppm of AA. The
signals of the methylene protons of AA are very close (the difference
is only 0.08 ppm), as discussed above. In addition, the integrals
of AC and AA protons are almost the same; therefore, this is an AC/AA
mixture of 1:1.

Contrary to PMDA and BTDA, the reaction of BAET
with OPDA produces
a mixture of AA and AC intermediates and PI, as indicated by the bands
at 1713 and 1776 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum. In the
3–4 ppm range of the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S6) of the intermediate, two pairs of
peaks were also observed; however, the signals of AA or PI methylenes
were much stronger than that of AC. Quantitative determination by
taking the integrals of these peaks is not accurate because they are
overlapped by the H2O signal, even after D2O
treatment (Figure S7). Hence, the intermediate
isolated from the BAET–OPDA reaction contains principally AA,
PI, and a minor quantity of AC. This AA intermediate easily eliminates
water to transform into PI.

The formation of different intermediates
from BAET and dianhydrides
is explained by the reaction mechanism and electrophilic effects of
substituents. In the first step of the reaction, an electron pair
of the amine, acting as a Lewis base, attacks a carbonyl carbon in
the anhydride group, acting as a Lewis acid center. The electron-withdrawing
substituents in the dianhydride will enhance the acidity of this carbonyl
carbon center and vice versa. As a consequence, the acidity of the
carbonyl carbon in anhydrides decreases according to the order PMDA
(two C=O as electron-withdrawing substituents) > BTDA (one
C=O substituent) > OPDA (O-ether as an electron-donating
substituent).
In addition, PMDA is more soluble than BAET in any solvent; therefore,
PMDA reacts at first with trace water or moisture to form carboxylic
acid, and then, this acid reacts with BAET to form an AC salt. Because
of its low acidity, OPDA is less sensitive to water and can react
with BAET to form an AA intermediate.

The intermediates isolated
from the reactions of BAET with BTDA
or OPDA were also further transformed into PAIs by thermal treatment.
The existence of the imide and amide structures of the final PAI products
was confirmed by the corresponding pairs of peaks at 1775/1712 and
1640/1540 cm–1 in the FTIR spectra (Figure 5).

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of (a) PI-BAET-PMDA,
(b) PI-BAET-BTDA, and (c) PI-BAET-OPDA.

From the TG curves (Figure 6) and Table 1, the thermal stability of PAIs prepared from BAET and dianhydrides
was according to the order of PI-BAET-PMDA > PI-BAET-BTDA >
PI-BAET-OPDA.
This reduction of thermal stability is clearly because of the rigidity
of benzene > C=O > −O– in the structure
of the
dianhydride moieties. The same order of the PI thermal stability with
dianhydrides was also reported.31 PI-BAET-BTDA
and PI-BAET-OPDA with more aromatic rings yield more char residues
at 800 °C compared to PI-BAET-PMDA.

The morphology of the obtained PAIs was also studied by wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (XRD) on powder specimens (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Wide-angle XRD patterns of (a) PI-BAET-PMDA,
(b) PI-BAET-BTDA,
and (c) PI-BAET-OPDA.

The broad peaks centered
at 2θ = 13.5° on each XRD pattern
indicated that they were almost amorphous and attributed to the average
intersegmental distance of polymer chains. The average d-spacing was
calculated based on Bragg’s law: nλ
= 2d sin θ, where d is the
dimension spacing, θ is the diffraction angle, λ is the
X-ray wavelength (1.54184 Å), and n is an integral number (1,
2, 3, ...). Therefore, the d-spacing values of our PAI samples were
calculated as 6.6 Å.

Another series of PAIs was prepared
from an aromatic amide-containing
diamine, N,N′-bis(4′-amino-4-biphenylene)isophthalamide,
and PMDA, BTDA, or OPDA23 by the bulk thermal
imidization of AAs. The XRD patterns of these PAIs showed broad peaks
at 2θ = 20° or d = 4.4 Å. These aromatic
PAIs have a slightly tighter chain packing compared to our N-aliphatic
PAI samples. Of course, the aliphatic chain is more flexible than
the aromatic moiety, and this higher flexibility to some extent disrupts
the order of the PAI chains and eventually leads to a higher d-spacing.

The thermal properties of PIs were investigated
by DSC. After the
first heating experiment (Figure 2a), the AC salt was converted into PI. The cooling
(b) and heating (c) curves (Figure 2) of PI showed a smooth, straight line as evidence
of no thermal occurrence, and Tg was not
detected, or this was a semicrystalline material. An independent DSC
analysis of the PI-BAET-PMDA sample after thermal treatment in a furnace
to 300 °C also showed similar curves. Figure S9 shows a very weak baseline shifting at approximately 160
°C before a large endo peak at 178 °C while heating for
the first time. The same weak baseline shifting was also seen in the
cooling and reheating curves. These weak changes could be assigned
to the Tg transition of PI-BAET-OPDA.
The PI-BAET-BTDA sample (Figure S8) showed
a clear Tg at 219 °C (midpoint when
cooling) or 231 °C (midpoint when heating).

The presence
of a flexible ether group in the PI-BAET-OPDA structure
makes it transform into a glass state at a lower temperature compared
to the PI-BAET-BTDA sample with the stiff carbonyl group in the main
chain.

These DSC results are comparable to the XRD analysis.
PI-BAET-BTDA
showed only a broad peak centered at 2θ = 13.5° of a more
amorphous structure, whereas PI-BAET-PMDA revealed one more peak at
20° (Figure 7a),
and PI-BAET-OPDA showed three more peaks at 18, 19.5, and 26°
for crystalline structures. The crystallinity of PI-BAET-PMDA was
derived from the strong inter- and intramolecular interactions of
the flat symmetrical pyromellitimide rings. In contrast, the crystallinity
of PI-PMDA-OPDA was acquired from the PI ring formation in solution.
The lower crystallinity of PI-PMDA-BTDA is ascribed to the PI formation
by the thermal treatment of AA and AC intermediates and the unsymmetrical
benzophenone ring.

In addition, the heating curves of PAI-BAET-BTDA
(Figure S8) and PAI-BAET-OPDA (Figure S9) showed endothermic peaks at 184 and
178 °C, respectively.
Combined with the TG curves (Figure 6b,c), this thermal occurrence could be because of a
physical transition without mass loss. These endothermic peaks could
be assigned to the transition of terephthalamide crystalline segments.

The novel PAIs are only soluble in phosphoric acid. The interaction
between PI and phosphoric acid was investigated by FTIR analysis.32 This PI was prepared from OPDA and 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl
ether. The FTIR results show that phosphoric acid interacts with PIs
mainly by hydrogen bonds rather than by the protonation of PI at RT.

The inherent viscosity (IV) in 85% H3PO4 solution
(0.5 g/dL at 30 °C) of PAIs was determined by using an Ostwald
viscometer of Cannon-Fenske, size no. 450. The IV values of PI-BAET-PMDA,
PI-BAET-BTDA, and PI-BAET-OPDA are 0.466, 0.204, and 1.15, respectively.
PI-BAET-OPDA showed the highest IV, whereas PI-BAET-PMDA and PI-BAET-BTDA
have lower IV values or lower molecular weights (MWs). This higher
MW of PI-BAET-OPDA could be the result of the direct formation of
PAI and AA in solution instead of the formation of AC intermediates.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, novel PAIs were prepared
from the reactions of BAET
with PMDA, BTDA, and OPDA. When PMDA was used, even in dried solvents,
the intermediate was isolated and identified as an AC salt. BTDA reacted
with BAET to form a mixture of AC and AA. In the case of OPDA, the
AA intermediate was mainly formed. These intermediates were converted
into PAIs by thermal treatment. This nonsolvent dehydration process
shows environmental advantages; however, the obtained PIs possess
noncrystalline structures. The N-aliphatic imide PI-BAET-PMDA shows
a high thermal stability compared to the fully aromatic PI. The presence
of carbonyl (BTDA) and ether (OPDA) groups in the dianhydrides enhances
their stability to moisture compared to the presence of a benzene
ring (PMDA); however, these groups exhibit a detrimental effect on
the thermal stability of the corresponding PAIs. The DSC and XRD characterizations
of the obtained PIs showed that PI-BAET-BTDA has lower crystallinity
than PI-BAET-PMDA and PI-BAET-OPDA. Among the three PIs, PI-BAET-OPDA
exhibits the highest inherent viscosity. BAET is an inexpensive, low
toxic, and nonvolatile diamine; therefore, its application in PAI
synthesis is valuable. These PAIs can be used as membrane-modifying
agents for industrial separation applications.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
BAET was prepared from
waste PET bottles.26 PMDA, BTDA or carbonyldiphthalic
anhydride, and ODPA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany).
PMDA was recrystallized from acetic anhydride. NMP, DMAc, DMSO, glacial
acetic acid, and other solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Munich, Germany).

4.2 Reaction of BAET with Dianhydrides
BAET (0.5000 g) was added to a 50 mL round bottom-flask containing
5 mL of solvent, and then, an equimolar quantity of dianhydride was
added slowly to the reaction mixture. The heterogeneous reaction mixture
gradually turned into a transparent solution and then became more
viscous and opaque.

The intermediate was isolated by treating
the transparent viscous solution with 60 mL of cool methanol. The
formed solid was filtered and further rinsed with 20 mL of methanol
for six times and then rinsed with acetone and finally dried under
a vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h. The isolated intermediate or reaction
mixture was converted into a PI by a stepwise thermal treatment in
an oven.

4.3 Characterization of the Product
An
FTIR-TENSOR II Bruker spectrometer (Bruker Optik GmbH, Ettlingen,
Germany) was used in transmission mode to record the spectra from
KBr pellets. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded with a Bruker ARX-500 NMR spectrometer operating at
500 MHz (1H) and 125 MHz (13C).

DSC was
performed with a METTLER STARe SW 11.00 instrument (Mettler-Toledo
Ltd., Thailand). The samples were heated from RT to 400 or 450 °C
with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. TG
analysis was carried out on Q500 Universal V4.5A (TA Instrument, NewCastle,
DE, USA) by heating from RT to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10
°C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Wide-angle X-ray diffractograms
were obtained by a D8-ADVANCE Bruker
X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (40 kV,
40 mA). The scanning rate was 0.01°/0.2 s. The samples were measured
as fine powders on a silicon sample holder.
