Metal clusters with
specific number of valence electrons are described
as superatoms. Super valence bond (SVB) model points out that superatoms
could form the superatomic molecules through SVBs by sharing nucleus
and electrons. The existence of superatom–superatom bonding
was verified by the shape of their orbitals in former studies. In
this paper, another important evidence—bond energy is studied
as the criterion for the SVBs using the density functional theory
method. In order to get the reliable values of bond energies, the
series of Zn–Cu and Mg–Li superatomic molecules composed
of two tetrahedral superatoms which do not share their nucleus are
designed. Considering the number of the valence electrons in one tetrahedral
superatomic unit, (Zn4)2/(Mg4)2, (Zn3Cu)2/(Mg3Li)2, (Zn2Cu2)2/(Mg2Li2)2, and (ZnCu3)2/(MgLi3)2 clusters are 8e–8e, 7e–7e, 6e–6e,
and 5e–5e binary superatomic molecules with super nonbond,
single bond, double bond, and triple bond, respectively, which are
verified by chemical bonding analysis depending on the SVB model.
Further calculations reveal that the bond energies increase and the
bond lengths decrease along with the bond orders in Zn–Cu and
Mg–Li systems which is in accordance with the classical nonbond,
single bond, double bond, and triple bond in C–H systems. Thus,
these values of bond energies confirm the existence of the SVBs. Moreover,
electron localization function analysis is also carried on to describe
the similarity between the superatomic bonds and atomic bonds in simple
molecules directly. This study reveals the new evidence for the existence
of the superatom–superatom bonding depending on the bond energies,
which gives the new insight for the further investigation of the superatomic
clusters.

1 Introduction
The metal clusters with
specific valence electrons could be described
by a nearly confined free electron gas in a spherically symmetric
potential which is defined as the spherical shell Jellium model,1−8 and these novel clusters are named as the superatoms.9−20 The electronic states in superatoms are proposed to bunch into several
superatomic orbitals of |1s2|1p6|1d10|2s21f14|2p61g18|2d103s21h22|..., where the resulting magic
numbers are 2, 8, 18, 20, 34, 40, 58, 68, and 90... This theory of
superatom has achieved great success in discussing the electronic
structures of spherical metal clusters.21−27 Taking the Al13– cluster as an example,
it could be viewed as a superatom with an icosahedral motif, which
has the closed electronic shell with 40 valence electrons (|1s2|1p6|1d10|2s21f14|2p6|).28−33 However, this model meets some difficulties when discussing the
clusters with a nonspherical structure. In 2013, Cheng and Yang34 proposed the super valence bond (SVB) model,
which gives the new insight into the electronic structure of superatomic
clusters. In this model, a prolate cluster is divided into two spherical
blocks sharing nucleus and valence pairs to achieve electronic closed
shell.35−41 This bonding pattern between superatoms is defined as the SVB which
has the similar characteristics as the bonding pattern between simple
atoms.

The SVB model has been successfully applied in understanding
the
electronic structures of variety superatomic clusters, especially
in some nonspherical clusters. For example, the prolate double-core
Li14 could be viewed as the union of two 10c–7e
(ten-center seven-electron) spherical superatoms sharing a six-nucleus
octahedron, which is the analogues of F2 with the single
covalent bond.34 Another example is Li20Mg3 (26 super valance electrons), it is formed
by two 13c–13e (thirteen-center thirteen-electron) superatoms
and has the similar electronic structure as V2, where the
super quintuple bonding exists.36 In addition
to the super covalent bonds between superatoms, the superatomic orbitals
could also hybridize to form the super hybrid bonds in the ligand
field.34,42,43 The super
orbitals of the Au6 core in the ligand-protected gold clusters
could compose the sp3, sp2 and, sp hybrid to
interact with the peripheral atoms to form the super hybrid bonds,
which are similar as CH4, NH3, and H2O molecules with tetrahedral, trigonal pyramidal, and angular shapes.44,45 Moreover, the sp2 Au6 superatomic unit could
compose the Au42 cluster with π aromaticity.46 Another example is the Au20 cluster,
in which the superatomic orbital of the truncated tetrahedron Au16 core undergo the d3s hybridization to interact
with the four apical Au atoms.47−51 A recent study reveals the 8e ligand-protected [Au12(SR)6]2 cluster with the sp3 core, which
exhibits the special bonding and optical properties.52

The SVB model reveals various bonding patterns between
superatoms
depending on the shape of orbitals. However, bond energy corresponding
to the bond order is another key parameter for chemical bonding which
has not been discussed for superatomic molecules before. In this paper,
bond energies between superatoms are calculated and compared with
the atomic bonds to verify the existence of SVBs. As the bond energies
between superatoms sharing nucleus are hard to evaluate in the superatomic
molecule, we design a series of Zn–Cu and Mg–Li metal
clusters composed of two tetrahedral superatoms in which superatoms
are just sharing electrons to form the SVB for our study. AdNDP (adaptive
natural density partitioning) chemical bondings are investigated to
reveal the superatomic bonding patterns in these superatomic molecules.
The calculated bond energies of the superatomic bonds are compared
with the nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple bond between
simple atoms. Further electron localization function (ELF) analysis
is carried out to ensure the existence of these kind of SVBs from
the strength of the electronic interaction.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Geometric Modeling
The superatoms
with the tetrahedral structure are popular in ligand-protected metal
clusters,48,53−60 such as (Au6) the core of [Au6(Ni3(CO)6)4]2– cluster,44 and (Ag4) core in Ag4X4 (X = H, Li, Na, K, Cu, Ag, Au, and F, Cl, Br) clusters.61 Therefore, two tetrahedral 8e superatoms Zn4 and Mg4 with the electronic shell filled as |1s2|1p6| are chosen as the objects in our study. Take
the Zn4 cluster as the example, two Zn4 superatom
compose the prolate (Zn4)2 superatomic molecule,
then Zn atoms in contraposition of two separate units are gradually
replaced by Cu atoms with one less valence electron and the similar
electronegativity, in order to obtain the superatomic molecules of
(Zn3Cu)2, (Zn2Cu2)2, and (ZnCu3)2 with the different valence
electrons. All the structures are optimized at the PBE0/def2-tzvp
level of theory, and the optimized structures are plotted in Figure 1a–e. As shown
in Figure 1a, Zn4 is a Td superatom
with the large highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) energy gap of 4.12 eV. The (Zn4)2 cluster composed of two Zn4 units
in Figure 2b has the D3d symmetry and the HOMO–LUMO
gap of 2.96 eV. In Figure 1c, two vertex atoms of the (Zn4)2 cluster
are replaced by Cu to form the D3d (Zn3Cu)2 cluster in order to ensure
that the electronic density is more concentrated in the waist of the
cluster which indicates a strong interaction. This cluster has a more
compact structure compared to (Zn4)2 and the
large HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.65 eV. When another two Zn atoms in
contraposition of the cluster are replaced by Cu, the (Zn2Cu2)2 cluster gets a better symmetry of C2h and the HOMO–LUMO
gap of 2.00 eV, of which the triplet state is more stable. Finally,
the (ZnCu3)2 cluster is obtained by replacing
the other two Zn atoms by Cu. This cluster has the C2h symmetry with HOMO–LUMO gap
of 2.35 eV. Moreover, the bond lengths and the distances between the
centers in back faces of two tetrahedral units for each structure
are also labeled in the Figure 1. The structures of this series of clusters are becoming more
compact from Figure 1b–e as their bond lengths and face–face distances are
getting smaller, which indicates the increasing Zn–Cu interaction.
The Mg–Li binary clusters undergo the similar structural evolution
as the Mg atoms are gradually replaced by Li atoms, as shown in Figure 2.

in Angstrom (Å) are labeled.

2.2 Chemical Bonding Analysis
As mentioned
above, Zn4 cluster could be viewed as the superatom of
the 8e close shell electronic structure. Thus, it could be inferred
that (Zn4)2 is composed of two Zn4 superatoms through the 8e–8e super nonbond. As the Cu atom
has one less valence electron than Zn, (Zn3Cu) unit could
be viewed as a 7e superatom, which would form the single SVB when
composing the (Zn3Cu)2 cluster. Similarly, (Zn2Cu2)2 is composed of two 6e (Zn2Cu2) units through the double SVB, and (ZnCu3)2 is formed by two 5e (ZnCu3) units
through the triple SVB. The Mg–Li binary clusters would follow
the similar rule in their chemical bonding systems. In order to verify
our inference, electronic characters of these clusters are discussed
depending on the SVB model using the AdNDP method. This method was
developed by Zubarev and Boldyrev62−65 and wildly used to analyze the
multicenter bonding systems in carbon, boron, and metal clusters.

As shown in Figure 3, AdNDP analysis reveals that there are four 4c–2e super lone
pairs (LPs) in each tetrahedral Zn4/Mg4 unit
with ON (occupied number) = 2.00 |e| (s), 1.92 |e| (px,y),
1.84 |e| (pz) in (Zn4)2, and 2.00 |e| (s), 1.96 |e| (px,y),
1.92 |e| (pz) in (Mg4)2. Therefore, the Zn4/Mg4 unit could be viewed as the 4c–8e superatom, which form the
(Zn4)2/(Mg4)2 superatomic
molecule through the 8e–8e super nonbond just as two inert
gas atoms or two CH4 molecules.

(b) (Mg4)2. Occupied
numbers are labeled below the structures.

In Figure 4a, (Zn3Cu)2 could be viewed as the union of
two 4c–7e
(Zn3Cu) superatoms. AdNDP analysis reveals that there are
three 4c–2e super LPs in each (Zn3Cu) unit (ON =
1.97 |e| for s, 1.83 |e| for px,y) and one 8c–2e
pz–pz σ bond between two (Zn3Cu) units (ON = 2.00 |e|). The (Mg3Li)2 also has three LPs
at each side of the superatomic molecule (ON = 2.00 |e| for s, and 1.95 |e| for px,y) and one 8c–2e pz–pz σ bonds (ON =
2.00 |e|), as shown in Figure 4b. These clusters have the similar bonding
pattern as F2 and CH3–CH3 molecules
and the Li14 superatomic molecule,34 which indicate the existence of a super single bond.

(b) (Mg3Li)2. Occupied
numbers are labeled below the structures.

The AdNDP chemical bondings of (Zn2Cu2)2 are shown in Figure 5a. The result indicates that there are two 4c–2e
LPs
(s, px) in each (Zn2Cu2) unit with ON = 1.98 |e|, 1.83 |e|, respectively. Moreover, the other p orbitals of two
(Zn2Cu2) units form the 8c–2e pz–pz σ bond
and py–py π bond with ON = 2.00 |e|. Similarly,
the (Mg2Li2)2 also has two LPs at
each side of the superatomic molecule (ON = 2.00 |e| for s, and 1.94 |e| for px) and two 8c–2e bonds (pz–pz σ, py–py π) (ON = 2.00
|e|), as shown in Figure 5b. These clusters have the similar bonding
pattern as O2 and CH2=CH2 molecules,
which could be viewed as the super double bond.

numbers are labeled below the structures.

As shown in Figure 6a, there is one 4c–2e LP (s) in each (ZnCu3) unit
with ON = 1.96 |e|. The p orbitals in two (ZnCu3) units of the (ZnCu3)2 cluster form
one 8c–2e pz–pz σ bond and two 8c–2e π bonds
(px–px, py–py) with ON = 2.00 |e|. (LiMg3)2 also has one LPs at each side of the superatomic molecule (ON =
1.99 |e|) and three 8c–2e bonds (σ,
2π) (ON = 2.00 |e|), as shown in Figure 6b. These clusters have the
similar bonding pattern as N2 and CH≡CH molecules,
which could be viewed as the super triple bond.

2.3 Comparison of Bond Energies
AdNDP
chemical bonding analysis verifies that non bond, single bond, double
bond and triple bond have also existed in the superatomic molecules
depending on the SVB model. Furthermore, bond energy is another key
parameter for chemical bonding. Thus, the bond energies of these super
non bond, single bond, double bond and triple bond are calculated
and compared with the corresponding atomic bonds in the following
part.

As these superatomic molecules are formed by the two tetrahedral
superatomic units which do not share the atomic nucleus, their bond
energy is defined as Eb(superatomic molecule)
= E(superatomic molecule) – 2E(superatoms) in our discussions, such as Eb(Zn4)2 = E((Zn4)2) – 2E(Zn4). The
bond energies for Zn–Cu, and Mg–Li systems with different
superatomic bond orders and their variation trend are obtained in Figure 7. Moreover, the bond
energies of the classical nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple
bond in C–H systems of CH4·CH4,
CH3–CH3, CH2=CH2 and CH≡CH molecules are also calculated for comparison.

Figure 7 Bond energies
vs bonder orders in C–H, Zn–Cu, and
Mg–Li systems.

As shown in Figure 7, the bond energies in Zn–Cu/Mg–Li superatomic
molecules
gradually increase along with their bond orders, which is similar
as hydrocarbon molecules. Thus, the superatomic bonds are getting
more intense from nonbond to triple bond, but still a little weaker
than the corresponding atomic bonds. This similar variation trend
between the molecules and superatomic molecules indicates their similar
bonding characters, which confirm the existence of the super nonbond,
single bond, double bond, and triple bond. Moreover, by comparing
Zn–Cu with Mg–Li systems, we found that their bond energies
are almost the same in single bond (σ bond) systems, whereas
in double and triple bond (σ + π, σ + 2π)
systems the differences increase. Thus, the differences of bond energies
are derived from the delocalized π bonds, which are stronger
in Zn–Cu systems probably because of their more compact geometric
structures and Cu–Cu metallophilic interaction.

Furthermore,
in order to compare the detailed characteristics of
super nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple bond, the variation
trends of bond energies versus the face–face distance between
two tetrahedral units in Zn–Cu and Mg–Li systems with
different bond orders are calculated respectively. The lowest point
in the energy curve represents the equilibrium structure of the cluster,
of which the corresponding R (face–face distance) is the bond
length. The result in Figure 8 indicates that the bond lengths decrease and the bond energies
increases along with the bond orders, which is in accordance with
the classical atomic non bond, single bond, double bond, and triple
bond.

between two tetrahedral units in (a) Zn–Cu and (b) Mg–Li
systems, respectively.

2.4 Electron Localization Functions
Electron
localization functions (ELFs) are studied in this part to further
reveal the electronic characters for the superatomic bondings discussed
above. ELF results indicate electronic density distribution in the
cross section of the clusters in color and shape. It is the relative
value within the range of (0, 1), in which highest value of 1.0 with
red color represents the full delocalization of strong interaction,
whereas smallest values of 0.0 with blue color represents no delocalization
of the weak interaction.

In order to make the results of ELFs
comparable, all Zn clusters (Zn4)2n+ with different valence electronic numbers n are chosen as the objects in our study to represent the
superatomic bonding systems with different bond orders, and their
structures are built without optimization to keep the same geometry
(the distance between the centers in back faces of two tetrahedral
units is 3.18 Å). Specifically, beside (Zn4)2 with super non bond, (Zn4)22+,
(Zn4)24+ (singlet and triplet), (Zn4)26+ are isoelectronic cluster of (Zn3Cu)2, (Zn2Cu2)2 and (ZnCu2)2 which contain the super single,
double, and triple bond, respectively.

The ELF scan is carried
on the middle cross section of these clusters
as shown in Figure 9. Moreover, the Ne2 with nonbond, F2 with a
single bond, O2 (singlet and triplet) with a double bond
and N2 with a triple bond are also investigated for comparison.
The shape and color of the ELF results indicate the similarity between
the simple bonds and the corresponding superatomic bonds with the
same bond order. In general, the ELF values increase and the color
gradually becomes vivid along with the bond orders, which indicates
that the strength of interactions increases. It is worth noting that
the shape of the super double bond in singlet and triplet (Zn4)24+ has the similar electronic characters
as O2. The singlet state is composed of one σ bond
and one π bond, whereas the circular triplet pattern contains
one σ and two 1/2 three-electron π bond exhibiting a magnetic
property, of which the latter pattern is more stable. Moreover, the
singlet-triplet energy gap of (Cu2Zn2)2 is 0.46 eV at PBE0/def2-tzvp level of calculation, and bond energies
of singlet and triplet Cu2Zn2–Cu2Zn2 cluster are 80.89 and 106.66 kcal/mol, respectively.
This result of ELFs confirms the superatomic bonding characters existed
in superatomic molecules.

double bond (Zn4)24+ (singlet and
triplet) and triple bond (Zn4)26+ compared with Ne2, F2, O2 (singlet
and triplet), and N2 in color and shape. The scale is labeled
aside.

3 Conclusions
In summary, series of Zn–Cu and Mg–Li superatomic
molecules with double tetrahedral structures are designed and their
bond energies are discussed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation.
Depending on the SVB model, AdNDP analysis reveals that there are
super nonbond in 8e–8e (Zn4)2/(Mg4)2, single bond in 7e–7e (Zn3Cu)2/(Mg3Li)2, double bond (Zn2Cu2)2/(Mg2Li2)2, and triple bond in 6e–6e (ZnCu3)2/(MgLi3)2, which have the similar characters
as the corresponding atomic chemical bonds. Moreover, bond energies
are calculated as the key evidence to confirm the bonding characters
of these SVBs. The results indicate that the bond energies increase
and the bond lengths decrease along with the bond orders in Zn–Cu
and Mg–Li systems which is in accordance with the classical
nonbond, single bond, double bond, and triple bond in C–H systems.
Finally, ELF analysis is carried on to give the direct description
for the strength of the electronic interaction to reveal the similarity
between the superatomic bonds and the atomic bonds in simple molecules
with different bond orders, which confirms the existence of the superatom–superatom
bonding systems.

Our study gives the new evidence for the existence
of the superatom–superatom
bonding depending on bond energies, which would give reference for
the further study and design of superatomic clusters.
