Wet-electrospun (WES) polymer micron
and submicron fibers are promising
building blocks for small, flexible optical fiber devices, such as
waveguides, sensors, and lasers. WES polymer fibers have an inherent
cylindrical geometry similar to that of optical fibers and a relatively
large aspect ratio. Furthermore, WES fibers can be produced using
low-cost and low-energy manufacturing techniques with large-area fabrication
and a large variety of materials. However, the high propagation loss
in the fibers, which is normally on the order of tens or thousands
of decibels per centimeter in the visible light region, has impeded
the use of these fibers in optical fiber devices. Here, the origin
of propagation losses is examined to develop a comprehensive and versatile
approach to reduce these losses. The excess light scattering that
occurs in fibers due to their inhomogeneous density is one of the
primary factors in the propagation loss. To reduce this loss, the
light transmission characteristics were investigated for single WES
polymer fibers heated at different temperatures. The propagation loss
was significantly reduced from 17.0 to 8.1 dB cm–1 at 533 nm wavelength, by heating the fibers above their glass transition
temperature, 49.8 °C. In addition, systematic verification of
the possible loss factors in the fibers confirmed that the propagation
loss reduction could be attributed to the reduction of extrinsic excess
scattering loss. Heating WES polymer fibers above their glass transition
temperature is a versatile approach for reducing the propagation loss
and should be applicable to a variety of WES fibers. This finding
paves the way for low-loss WES fiber waveguides and their subsequent
application in small, flexible optical fiber devices, including waveguides,
sensors, and lasers.

Introduction
Wet electrospinning is a simple, versatile,
and widely used technique
for producing submicron and micron polymer fibers. This technique
has considerable potential for low-cost and low-energy manufacturing
with large fabrication area, providing high material utilization ratios
and high positional accuracy.1,2 The electrospinning
technique can instantaneously and continuously produce fibers with
lengths of more than tens of centimeters that have an inherent cylindrical
geometry similar to that of optical fibers.3 Furthermore, wet-electrospun (WES) fibers can be produced from a
wide variety of spinnable polymers and composites, including highly
transparent polymers and optically active composites.4−6 Thus, WES fibers are promising building blocks for small, flexible
optical fiber devices, such as waveguides, sensors, and lasers.6−11 However, high propagation loss in WES fibers, normally on the order
of tens or thousands of decibels per centimeter in the visible light
region,6,7,9−15 has impeded their widespread use.

Fasano et al. reduced the
propagation loss caused by the surface
morphology of WES conjugated polymer fibers by producing the fibers
in a precisely controlled nitrogen atmosphere,14 but this approach could only be applied to specific materials.
We previously reported that the high propagation loss in WES fibers
could be attributed to (i) excess light scattering in the fibers resulting
from their inhomogeneous density and (ii) loss at the interface between
the fiber core and cladding, originating from nonuniformity of the
fiber diameters.7

In this study,
we reduced the propagation loss in WES polymer fibers
by reducing excess light scattering in the fibers by a versatile heat
treatment approach. The light transmission characteristics of single
WES polymer fibers treated at different post-electrospinning temperatures
revealed that the propagation loss was reduced significantly by 5.9
dB cm–1 at 532 nm wavelength when the fibers were
heated above their glass transition temperature (Tg).

Experimental Details
Fiber Fabrication and Morphological
Characterization
Amorphous poly(lactic acid) composed of
a racemic mixture of d- and l-lactic acid units
(PDLLA) was used as the
fiber material because it exhibits high transparency in the visible
ranges16 and has a lower Tg than other well-known amorphous transparent polymers
such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS).17 The lower Tg value
enables easier investigation of the thermal properties of samples
in this initial study. The as-received PDLLA pellets (Mw = 300 000–600 000, Polysciences,
Inc.) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (99.0%, Wako Pure Chemicals
Industries, Ltd.) with a concentration of 16 wt %. The solution was
then loaded into a glass syringe equipped with a 0.18 mm-diameter
stainless-steel needle and was supplied continuously at a rate of
0.02 mL h–1 using a syringe pump (KDS-100, KD Scientific,
Inc.). A high-voltage power supply (HVU-30P100, MECC Co., Ltd.) was
connected to the needle at 4.8 kV. The alternating biased-collector
electrospinning method18 was used to fabricate
single-aligned PDLLA fibers. Two stainless-steel collectors with 3
cm separation were placed 8 cm below the tip of the needle, one of
which was biased with a negative voltage (−800 V) using a high-voltage
power source (HJPM-1N3, Matsusada Precision Inc.). The electrospinning
experiments were performed in air at temperatures of 24–25
°C with a relative humidity of 53–63%. The single-aligned
electrospun PDLLA fibers were collected in two lengths. One length
was placed on a silicon substrate to characterize the shape of each
fiber before heating. The other length was attached to two tapered
optical silica fibers (Fine Glass Technologies Co., Ltd.) to conduct
waveguiding measurements (see Figure 1, STEP 1). The morphology of the single-aligned fibers
was investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, SU8000, Hitachi) operating at 5.0 kV after a 4 nm-thick Os
coating was applied. The mean diameter of each fiber was determined
by averaging diameters taken from FESEM images at more than 12 800
positions along the 250 μm-long fibers using image analysis.
A number of aligned WES PDLLA fibers were prepared by collecting the
fibers for 30 min using a 15 cm-diameter gear-shaped rotating collector
to conduct thermal, X-ray, and spectroscopic characterizations. The
rotating speed of the collector was maintained at 100 rpm to prevent
the as-spun fibers from being stretched by the collector.

the experimental setup for measuring the propagation
loss and transmitted light intensity in a single PDLLA fiber.

Waveguiding Measurements
First, a collimated 532 nm
laser (LCM-T-111, Laser-Export Co. Ltd.) beam with a 440 μm
radius was irradiated to each fiber at different positions [Figure 1, STEP 1] to investigate
the propagation loss in single WES PDLLA fibers. The laser beam was
applied at a 43° angle to the fiber axis, and the polarization
direction of the beam was perpendicular to the fiber axis. A portion
of the laser beam was coupled to a guiding mode in the PDLLA fiber
and collected via a right-tapered optical fiber after being guided
through the PDLLA fiber. The intensity of the collected light was
measured with a spectrometer (USB4000, Ocean Optics, Inc.). Then,
a 632.8 nm He–Ne laser (GLG5370, NEC Corp.) beam was introduced
to the PDLLA fiber from the left tapered optical silica fiber, and
the intensity of the guided light collected via the right tapered
optical fiber was monitored while using different heating temperatures
(see Figure 1, STEP
2). After cooling of the heated PDLLA fibers by stopping the heating,
the measurement performed in STEP 1 was repeated in STEP 3 (see Figure 1, STEP 3). After
the measurement, each fiber was placed on a silicon substrate to characterize
the fiber shape. The propagation loss was also investigated at the
following wavelengths using collimated laser diode modules in the
same manner as that in STEP 1 and STEP 3: 450 nm (CPS450, Thorlabs
Inc.), 521 nm (CPS520, Thorlabs Inc.), 639 nm (CPS635, Thorlabs Inc.),
and 849 nm (CPS850, Thorlabs Inc.). Each collimated laser beam was
irradiated to the single PDLLA fiber though a 1.0 mm-diameter pinhole.

Thermal, X-ray, and Spectroscopic Characterization
The thermal
properties of the WES PDLLA fibers and PDLLA pellets
were investigated with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC-60,
Shimadzu Corp.) under a nitrogen gas flow at a rate of 50 mL min–1. Each sample of the WES PDLLA fibers (1.6 mg) or
PDLLA pellets (3.0 mg) was heated at a rate of 10 °C min–1 from ambient temperature to 200 °C.

The
molecular structure of the PDLLA in the WES fibers was investigated
using an X-ray diffractometer (RINT-2500, Rigaku Corp.) with a Cu
Kα source (wavelength of 1.5418 Å), which was operated
at 40 kV and 200 mA.

The specific optical rotation of the PDLLA
was measured in chloroform
at a concentration of 10 g L–1 at 25 °C using
a polarimeter (P-2100, JASCO) with a wavelength of 0.589 μm.

The ultraviolet (UV)–visible (Vis)–near infrared
(NIR) attenuation spectra were measured using a UV–Vis–NIR
spectrophotometer (U-4100, Hitachi). A fused glass cell with a 1.0
cm path length was used to measure the transmittance spectra of pure
PDLLA, chlorobenzene, and 16 wt % PDLLA solution in chlorobenzene.
The pure PDLLA sample was prepared by filling the PDLLA pellets into
the cell and melting them at 120 °C for 12 h.

The polymer
chain orientation in the WES PDLLA fibers was evaluated
using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer (Thermo Nicolet
6700, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) equipped with a wire grid polarizer
(KRS-5 Wire Grid Polarizer, S. T. Japan). The FT-IR spectrometer resolution
was 4 cm–1, and 128 scans were collected and averaged.
In parallel polarization, the direction of the oscillating electric
field of the incident IR beam is parallel to the aligned fiber axis;
in perpendicular polarization, it is perpendicular to the fiber axis.

Results and Discussion
The specific optical rotation of
the used PDLLA was measured to
be approximately zero, while the optical rotations of poly(lactic
acid) composed of pure optical isomers, namely poly(l-lactic
acid) (PLLA) or poly(d-lactic acid), are reported to be −156
and 156° dm–1 g–1 cm3, respectively.19 This result confirmed
that the PDLLA used in this study was comprised of equivalent amounts
of l- and d-lactic acid20 to form an amorphous polymer. The X-ray diffraction patterns of
the WES PDLLA fibers were also measured, but no obvious diffraction
peaks were found at 2θ between 15° and 20°, even though
crystallized PLLA exhibits diffraction peaks within this angle range.21 This result confirmed that the WES PDLLA fibers
were amorphous.

Five single-aligned WES PDLLA fibers, which
were approximately
3 cm long, (Fibers A–E) were fabricated. One part of each fiber
was placed on a silicon substrate to investigate the fiber morphology. Figure 2a shows an FESEM
image of a single-aligned PDLLA fiber (Fiber A). The fiber was obtained
with a smooth surface. The mean and standard deviation of the fiber
diameters of each fiber are summarized in Table 1. The mean diameter ranges from 1.60 to 1.76
μm.

from the left tapered fiber to the PDLLA fiber.

 	standard deviation (μm)	0.14	0.13	0.22	0.23	0.20	
Then, a part of each fiber was attached to two tapered
optical
silica fibers, as shown in the bright-field microscopy image in Figure 2b. The PDLLA fibers
were manually attached to the facing tapered fibers without much difficulty
because electrostatic attraction appeared to act between the charged
electrospun PDLLA fibers and tapered fibers. As shown in the bright-
[Figure 2b] and dark-field
[Figure 2c] microscopy
images, a red laser beam with 632.8 nm wavelength was coupled to the
PDLLA fiber from the left tapered fiber, although part of the laser
beam was radiated at the tip of the left tapered fiber. The thin red
line observed in Figure 2b,c along the PDLLA fiber position demonstrates that the light was
guided in the fiber. Relatively bright dots observed along the PDLLA
fiber in Figure 2c
could be attributed to scattering of the guided light at the points
with locally inhomogeneous morphology.

Figure 3 shows dependence
of the transmitted light intensity, normalized by the peak intensity,
on the fiber temperature, using the same setup as that illustrated
in Figure 1 STEP 2.
The fiber temperature was increased from room temperature by 1.1–1.4
°C min–1 until the PDLLA fiber was broken.
Even at room temperature (25–28 °C), the transmitted light
intensity was more than 160 times higher than that after the PDLLA
fiber was broken, which confirmed that direct light coupling from
the left-tapered silica fiber to the right-tapered silica fiber, which
was primarily caused by the radiated light at the tip of the left
fiber, was negligible. Consequently, the introduced laser beam was
mainly guided in the PDLLA fiber and was collected via the right-tapered
optical fiber. The transmitted light intensity increased with increasing
temperature, showing significant increases at around 45–55
°C. Moreover, the intensity showed peaks at around 55–60
°C. Over this temperature range, the intensity showed a saturated
and/or unstable value until the intensity drop occurred because of
the break of the PDLLA fiber. The transmitted light intensity was
3.5 times higher after heating than that before heating. These results
indicated that the propagation loss in the PDLLA fibers was reduced
by heating, but reduction of the connection loss between the PDLLA
fiber and the tapered silica fibers remained a possible reason for
the increased transmitted light intensity because the connection area
was also heated in the present setup, as shown in Figure 1 STEP 2.

Figure 3 Normalized intensity
of the 632.8 nm light after transmission through
each PDLLA fiber attached to the tapered optical fibers with increasing
temperature. The different colored plots correspond to the different
single fibers.

The thermal properties
of the WES PDLLA fibers and the as-received
PDLLA pellets were investigated using DSC, as shown in Figure 4. The Tg value was determined to be 49.8 °C for the fibers (first
heating), 53.1 °C for the fibers (second heating), and 53.5 °C
for the pellets (second heating). Both samples from the second heating
showed approximately equivalent Tg values
because their erased thermal history allowed the thermal properties
of the PDLLA material to dominate; however, the Tg value for the first heating fibers showed a slight decrease.
Similar Tg decreases were previously reported
for WES PDLLA fibers22 and thin polymer
films.23,24 The evaluated Tg of the WES fibers corresponded to the temperature range of 45–55
°C, where the transmitted light intensity significantly increased.
Excess light scattering loss in PMMA bulks has been reduced by polymerization
or by heating the material above Tg;25,26 thus, the increase in the transmitted light intensity near and above
the Tg value could be partially attributed
to the reduction of excess light scattering loss in the PDLLA fibers.

of WES PDLLA fibers and as-received PDLLA pellets.

To understand the change in propagation loss in
each WES fiber
due to heating and avoiding the effects of the connection loss, we
measured the propagation loss before and after heating using the procedure
shown in Figure 1.
Here, the maximum heating temperature was determined to be around
55 °C because this temperature was above Tg of the WES PDLLA fibers and where the transmitted light intensity
showed the maximum intensity (Figure 3).

The propagation loss was determined by measuring
the guided light
intensity with different propagation lengths (l)
using the procedure explained above. Here, l was
determined as the length from the center of the spot at which the
collimated laser was irradiated to the tip of the right tapered silica
fiber. Figure 5a shows
the normalized guided light intensity with different l, measured for a single WES PDLLA fiber (Fiber A) before and after
heating. The wavelength of the irradiated light was 532 nm. The intensity
decreased with increasing l, and the plots adequately
fit the function e–al [solid lines
in Figure 5a], where a is the loss coefficient. The propagation loss was evaluated
using the following formula: −10 log(e–al|l=1cm/e–al|l=0cm) = 10a log(e) [dB cm–1]. Figure 5b summarizes the evaluated propagation loss
of each PDLLA fiber before and after heating. The propagation loss
was significantly reduced after heating for all five PDLLA fibers.
For example, the propagation loss of Fiber A was reduced from 17 to
8.1 dB cm–1, which corresponded to an 8.2-fold increase
in the transmitted light intensity when the light is guided through
1.0 cm of the fiber. These results demonstrated that heating of the
WES PDLLA fibers above Tg significantly
reduced the propagation loss in the fibers. The propagation loss of
Fiber E was reduced to 5.9 dB cm–1, which was the
lowest propagation loss reported for WES polymer fibers.6,7,9−15 Increase in fiber diameters normally decreases the propagation loss
in the fibers,27−29 but significant increase in the mean diameter was
not observed after heating, as shown in Table 1, although the propagation loss was significantly
reduced for all five fibers. This result shows that some other loss
factors were reduced after heating.

propagation lengths before and after heating, where the wavelength

losses of the five single PDLLA fibers, evaluated before and after

The possible loss factors for
WES fibers (from refs30−32) are summarized in Figure 6, separated into intrinsic
and extrinsic factors.

To investigate the absorption loss in the WES PDLLA fibers,
UV–Vis–NIR
measurement was conducted. Figure 7 shows the UV–Vis–NIR attenuation spectra
of pure PDLLA, chlorobenzene, 16 wt % PDLLA solution in chlorobenzene,
and water in a 1.0 cm path-length fused glass cell. Each attenuation
spectrum was converted from the transmittance spectrum of the respective
sample; thus, the measured attenuation included attenuation due to
light reflection and scattering at each interface including that between
air and the fused glass cell. Unique attenuation peaks due to the
electronic transition absorption or molecular vibration absorption
of materials were observed at wavelengths shorter than 450 nm and
longer than 700 nm for pure PDLLA, chlorobenzene, and PDLLA solution.
On the other hand, in the wavelength range from 450 to 680 nm, the
attenuation spectra decreased with increasing wavelength as a result
of the light reflection and scattering at each interface and the light
scattering inside each filled material. Consequently, the intrinsic
absorption loss in the wavelength range of 450–680 nm was estimated
to be less than 0.02 dB cm–1 from the attenuation
spectrum of pure PDLLA, by subtracting the gradually decreasing attenuation
and considering the 1 cm pass length. The extrinsic absorption loss
caused by transition metals and organic contaminants was estimated
to be less than 0.02 dB cm–1 from the attenuation
spectrum of the pure PDLLA, chlorobenzene, and PDLLA solution because
no peaks exceeding 0.02 dB were observed at this wavelength range.
Although the attenuation spectrum of water indicated that its absorption
loss was less than 0.5 dB cm–1 in the wavelength
range of 450–680 nm, as shown in Figure 7, the absorption loss of WES PDLLA fibers
could decrease to less than 0.05 dB cm–1 if the
fibers contained 10% water relative to the fiber volume. These results
confirmed that the intrinsic and extrinsic absorption losses were
much lower than the propagation loss in the WES PDLLA fibers.

Figure 7 UV–Vis–NIR
attenuation spectra of pure PDLLA, chlorobenzene,
16 wt % PDLLA solution in chlorobenzene, and water, which were placed
in a 1.0 cm path-length fused glass cell.

The intrinsic scattering loss originating from the intrinsic
density
inhomogeneity of the materials was the lower limit of scattering loss
inherent to each material that remained even after the extrinsic scattering
loss, namely the excess light scattering loss.33 Thus, the intrinsic scattering loss was not significantly
reduced by the heat treatment. By roughly estimating the intrinsic
loss from the measured attenuation spectrum of pure PDLLA [Figure 7], the intrinsic
scattering loss was estimated to be less than 0.8 dB cm–1. However, this value of the intrinsic scattering loss should be
an overestimation because both the light reflection loss and extrinsic
light scattering loss were included in the measured attenuation spectrum.
Moreover, the intrinsic scattering loss for other amorphous polymers,
namely PMMA and PS, has been estimated to be less than 1 × 10–3 dB cm–1 at wavelengths of around
533 nm.32,34

Extrinsic scattering due to dust in
the environment may occur during
the measurements for transmitting light intensity and propagation
loss; however, no large dust particles were observed in the bright-field
microscope image of the PDLLA fiber [Figure 2b]. The dark-field microscope image of the
fiber [Figure 2c] indicated
relatively bright scattering points because of small dust particles
or other factors not visible in the bright-field image, and the plots
of the guided light intensity showed some variation [Figure 5a]. However, the variation
was smoothed by fitting the plots with a single exponential function
before the propagation loss was determined. Therefore, the local scattering
loss due to dust should be negligible for the measured propagation
loss. Moreover, the heat treatment could not reduce the scattering
loss due to dust; thus, other factors caused the propagation loss
reduction after heating. Additionally, the extrinsic radiation loss
due to bends in the PDLLA fibers was negligible because the PDLLA
fibers were kept straight during the optical measurements [Figure 2b].

The extrinsic
scattering loss and radiation loss due to fluctuations
in the fiber diameter are possible factors influencing the propagation
loss in the WES PDLLA fibers, as previously indicated for WES PMMA
fibers.7 Higher fluctuations in the fiber
diameter cause higher propagation loss.29 To discuss the fluctuations before and after heating, the root-mean-square
roughness (RRMS) for each fiber was calculated
using the FESEM images of each 250 μm long PDLLA fiber; more
than 12 800 readings for each fiber were recorded using image
analysis. The RRMS was calculated using
the following formula 1  where D, Dave, and l are the measured diameter
of the fibers, the mean diameter of each fiber, and the position where
the diameter was measured, respectively. Figure 8 summarizes RRMS of each fiber before and after heating. No clear reduction of the RRMS was observed after heating even though all
five WES PDLLA fibers demonstrated reduced propagation loss [Figure 5b]. This result confirmed
that extrinsic scattering loss and radiation loss due to the fluctuations
in the fiber diameter must be excluded from the factors for propagation
loss reduction due to heat treatment.

Figure 8 RRMS of each
PDLLA fiber before and
after heating.

Extrinsic scattering
loss due to the extrinsic density inhomogeneity
resulting from microvoids, microscopic density variation, and birefringence
is the only possible remaining loss factor for the propagation loss
reduction because of post-fabrication heat treatment. Consequently,
extrinsic scattering loss must be the primarily reduced loss factor
to account for the observed propagation loss reduction. Extrinsic
density inhomogeneity causes excess light scattering, including Rayleigh,
Mie, or geometric scattering, so that excess light scattering results
in extrinsic scattering loss. Moreover, excess light scattering was
recently reported to be one of the main factors for propagation loss
in WES PMMA fibers,7 and the excess light
scattering in PMMA bulks was reported to be reduced by heating them
above Tg.25,26 These reports
support the present reduction of propagation loss in WES PDLLA fibers
because of heat treatment. Figure 9 shows the measured propagation loss in an WES PDLLA
fiber with different wavelengths before and after heating. The propagation
loss significantly decreased with the increasing wavelength, which
was also observed in the as-WES PMMA fibers.7 This result confirmed that the propagation loss in the PDLLA fiber
included extrinsic scattering loss. The propagation loss was significantly
reduced after heating, especially at shorter wavelengths, which indicated
that the enhanced excess light scattering at shorter wavelengths,
for example, enhanced Rayleigh scattering35 proportional to (wavelength)−4, was significantly
reduced after heating.

Figure 9 Propagation loss of the PDLLA fiber with different wavelengths
before and after heating.

To investigate birefringence in the WES PDLLA fibers, polarized
FT-IR spectra of aligned PDLLA fibers were measured, as shown in Figure 10a. The peak at
1755 cm–1 was assigned to C=O stretching,
and the peaks at 1186 and 1090 cm–1 were assigned
to C–O–C stretching.36,37 These stretchings
are parallel to the polymer backbone. The main chains of PDLLA in
the as-electrospun PDLLA fibers were modestly aligned along the fiber
axis because the absorbance was higher with parallel polarization
at around 1090, 1186, and 1755 cm–1 than that with
perpendicular polarization. The dichroic ratio was calculated to be
2.14 by integrating the polarized absorbance in the range from 1650
to 1850 cm–1. The alignment of the PDLLA chains
was relaxed after heating because the dichroic ratio after heating
decreased to 1.35, as shown in Figure 10b. This alignment relaxation should reduce
the birefringence in the PDLLA fibers and partially decrease the extrinsic
scattering loss. The effects of microvoids and microscopic density
variation are still unclear, but wet-electrospinning produces fibers
with rapidly evaporating solvents so that microvoids and microscopic
density variation are generated. Several papers reported inhomogeneous
inner structures of polymers in WES fibers,5,38 and
the WES PDLLA fibers in the present study showed higher propagation
loss at shorter wavelength, reflecting the extrinsic density inhomogeneity.
A previous work reported that PMMA bulks without heat treatment above Tg included inhomogeneous structures with a dimension
of about 100 nm, which caused excess light scattering and increased
scattering loss.25,26 Additionally, the inhomogeneous
structures disappeared after heat treatment above Tg, and the scattering loss was reduced. On the basis of
these results, inhomogeneous structures in the WES PDLLA fibers, microvoids,
and microscopic density variation, should be reduced after heat treatment
above Tg.

of the aligned PDLLA fibers (a) before
and (b) after heating. Here, parallel and perpendicular represent
the polarized directions of the oscillating electric field of the
incident IR beam to the fiber direction.

We demonstrated that heating amorphous WES fibers above Tg is a versatile approach for reducing their
propagation loss. This technique should be applicable to a variety
of WES fibers composed of amorphous polymers. Moreover, optimizing
the heating conditions should reduce the propagation loss below the
loss observed in this study (lower than 5 dB cm–1 at 533 nm wavelength).

Conclusions
We demonstrated a comprehensive
and versatile approach for reducing
propagation loss in WES polymer fibers by heating the fibers above
the glass transition temperature of PDLLA. This heat treatment significantly
reduced the propagation loss in amorphous WES PDLLA fibers from 17.0
to 8.1 dB cm–1 at a wavelength of 533 nm. The propagation
loss reduction could be attributed to the reduction of extrinsic excess
scattering losses due to the extrinsic density inhomogeneity in the
fibers. These findings pave the way for low-loss WES fiber waveguides
and their application in small, flexible optical fiber devices such
as waveguides, sensors, and lasers.
