A general
method for highly functionalized 2-pyrones via a base-mediated
sequential vinylogous addition and cyclization of γ-phosphonyl/sulfonyl
crotonates and ynones are described. An exclusive E-geometry with
respect to the newly generated olefin substituent at C3 of pyrone
was observed. Imino glyoxalates and glycine imines similarly reacted
with ynones to deliver 3-imino pyrones.

Introduction
2-Pyrone not only occurs
very frequently in natural products isolated
from plants, animals, marine sources, and microorganisms but also
appears quite often in biologically and pharmaceutically active synthetic
molecules.1−6 A 2-pyrone skeleton with different substitution patterns is known
to possess a wide range of biological activities such as antimicrobial,2 antifungal,3 anti-inflammatory,4 anti-HIV,5 and anticancer.6 Further, with its unique electronically biased
unsaturated cyclic system, it has been utilized as a versatile building
block in organic synthesis especially as a diene component in Diels–Alder
reactions.7 As a result, considerable attention
has been devoted to access diversely functionalized pyrone compounds
by employing different methods.8 Despite
the fact that these methods made processes more facile and efficient,
there still exists a vast need to develop the new methodologies to
broaden the diversity of the pyrone compounds. There have been several
efforts made in recent times addressing various limitations associated
with traditional methods. One of the most convenient methods found
in such efforts is the use of alkyne as the substrate.9 Electrophilic iodo cyclization of yne-enoates by Yao and
Larock,9a rhodium-catalyzed oxidative coupling
of substituted acrylic acids with alkynes by Miura et al.,9b ruthenium-catalyzed intermolecular homo and
heterodimerization of substituted propiolates by Manikandan and Jeganmohan,9c sequential alkyne activation of terminal alkynes
and propiolic acids by gold(I) catalysts by Schreiber et al.,9d palladium-catalyzed one-pot regioselective 6-endo
cyclization and alkylation/alkenylation of enynoates by Loh et al.,9e,9f and Pradasani et al.,9g were the prominent
examples. Another interesting method is the conjugate addition and
cyclization of active methylene compounds and ynones.10 Surprisingly, the pioneering work by Baddar’s group10a using alkyl aryl acetates (Scheme 1a) has not been much elaborated
to other active methylene substrates. An effort by Shimizu et al.10b with β-keto esters led to rearranged
products (Scheme 1b)
often as a mixture of compounds with decarboxylated congeners.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2-Pyrones from Ynones
Herein, as a part of our ongoing efforts of unearthing the novel
reactivities of activated alkynes,11 we
describe the synthesis of uniquely functionalized 2-pyrones based
on a concept of sequential allylic γ-carbon conjugate addition
and cyclization of γ-phosphonyl/sulfonyl crotonates and ynones
(Scheme 1c). Further,
imino glyoxalates and glycine imines were found to similarly react
with ynones to deliver 3-imino pyrones (Scheme 1d). This later result is quite contrasting
to the findings by Deng et al.12 to access
five-membered adducts from same substrates under silver catalysis
(Scheme 1e).

Results
and Discussion
We initiated our investigation (Table 1) using readily available ynone 1a and phosphonyl crotonate 2. When NaH was used
as the
base in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), we obtained the desired product 3a but in 30% yield (entry 1). NaOH and NaOEt also afforded
the desired product but in moderate yield (entry 2, 3). Other inorganic
base CS2CO3 was not found to be suitable for
this transformation (entry 4). Pleasingly, when KOtBu was employed as the base, the product was obtained in 60%
yield whereas no product was observed in the absence of the base (entry
5, 6). Other solvents like dimethylformamide (DMF), 1,4-dioxane, toluene,
tetrahydrofuran (THF), and MeCN were screened with KOtBu and DMF was found to be the most suitable for
the transformation with a product yield of 70% (entry 7–11).

With the optimization conditions
in hand, we set out to investigate
the generality of this vinylogous Michael addition and concomitant
cyclization reaction with various ynones and initially with phosphonyl
crotonate 2a as depicted in Table 2. At first, we investigated the reactivity
against electronic variation in ynones. Like 1a, various
alkylated phenyl ynones (1b–f) smoothly reacted
with 2a, irrespective of the group (Me, Et, tBu, and nPent) and position
(m or p), to give the corresponding products 3b–f in excellent yields of 70–76%. Higher electron rich counterparts 1g and 1h with methoxy groups at the meta or
para position cleanly underwent the transformation, giving expected
adducts 3g–h in anticipated products in good yields
(67%). Halogenated phenyl groups with Cl, Br, and F (1i–k) smoothly underwent in standard conditions and delivered the desired
products in good yields (3i–k in 68–72%)
and the structure of 3i was unambiguously confirmed by
X-ray crystallography. Ynones with other aryl and heteroaryl groups
like naphthyl and pyridyl (1l–m) showed similar
reactivity to afford the products (3l–m) with
equal ease and with no loss in the geometry selectivity of the olefin
substituent.

Table 2 Scope of Ynones
Setting a limitation, the
aliphatic ynones 1n and 1o proved to be
unproductive in the transformation (a). The
extended conjugation from the aryl group to
ynone thus remains essential for this transformation. a  

We next studied the effect of the substitution at the ketone
terminus
of ynone (Table 3).
Toluoyl ynone 1p showed excellent reactivity (3p in 77% yield) whereas electron deficient halo-aryl ynones 1q–s with F or Cl, and nitro aryl ynone 1t were found to be slightly less productive giving the corresponding
products 3q–t in 61–70% yields. Further,
heteroarylated (furanyl and thiophenyl) adducts 3u and 3v were smoothly obtained from relevant substrates (1u–v) in 66–69% yields.

b Isolated yields.

Our attention was next turned
to check whether sulfonyl crotonates
with analogous active methylene groups participate similarly in the
above transformation. Pleasingly, 4a reacted with ynone 1a smoothly under standard conditions to afford 5a in 67% yield (Table 4). Geometry of the newly generated olefin tether was trans as usual
and was highly exclusive and the structure was unambiguously confirmed
by X-ray crystallography. The toluene sulfonyl substrate was also
found to similarly participate in the addition/cyclization sequence
to produce the corresponding 2-pyrones 5b in 70% yield
with E-vinyl sulfonyl tether at C3.

Table 4 Scope of Sulfonyl Crotonates
We thereafter became curious to know the
fate of glyoxyl benzyl
imine 6 (Table 5), which structurally closely resembles 2 and 4, in the above addition/cyclization sequence. They are supposed
to produce 2-pyrones with iminyl substitution at C3. Gratifyingly, 1a smoothly underwent the proposed transformation with 6a to give anticipated iminyl-substituted pyrone 7a in 67% yield. Similarly, imine formed from fluoro benzyl amine 6b was found to successfully deliver the corresponding pyrone 7b in 62% yield. Steric congestion in the imines formed from
secondary benzyl amines did not affect the reaction during the synthesis
of pyrones 7c–f (68–72%). Structure of 7c was also further confirmed by the X-ray crystallography
study.

Table 5 Scope of Benzyl Imines
Glycenimene 8 upon deprotonation is supposed to straightly
give the stable carbanion stabilized by ester unlike in the above
case 6 where a delocalization occurred to reach the same.
Hence 8 would in principle deliver the same products
(7). As expected, 8a–c when exposed
to the standard conditions in the presence of ynone 1a cleanly formed the pyrones 7a–c, respectively,
in 64–70% yields (Scheme 2). Thus, the same products are available from either
way as both the starting materials are easily accessible from commercially
available chemicals unlike in the case of crotonates 2 and 4 whose other isomers are difficult to be assembled.

Scheme 2 Scope of Glycenimenes
A plausible mechanism for the γ-carbon vinylogus Michael
addition/cyclization13 of EWG tethered
crotonates with ynones is depicted in Scheme 3. Base-mediated deprotonation of 2/4/6 gave carbanion A which
is delocalized to give ester-stabilized carbanions that underwent
Michael addition with ynone 1 to give B.
Conjugation-based stability incurred E-geometry to the migrated olefin.
Second deprotonation adjacent to the ester led to demethoxylative
cyclization through C and D to afford the
pyrone 3/5/7.

Scheme 3 Plausible
Mechanism
In conclusion, we achieved
an efficient access to novel, densely
functionalized pyrones from readily available EWG attached crotonates
and ynones via a base-mediated sequential vinylogus conjugate addition
and concomitant cyclization. A huge variety of substrates were converted
to the corresponding pyrones to show the generality of the method.
Imino glyoxalates and glycine imines, having structural resemblance
to these crotonates, were also shown to be successful substrates for
the transformation to give 3-iminylated 2-pyrones.
