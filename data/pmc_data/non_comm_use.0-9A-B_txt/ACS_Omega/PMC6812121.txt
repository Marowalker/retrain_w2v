A new adsorbent derived
from the naturally occurring biopolymers,
chitosan (CS) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) was prepared by cross-linking
them using EDTA. EDTA having high affinity for metal ions can be used
to enhance the chelation properties of the adsorbent enormously. The
product obtained (chitosan-EDTA-CMC, CSECM) was characterized by different
techniques: FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDAX, TGA, and XPS. The parameters for
evaluation of the adsorption properties for removal of Cu(II) ions
from the aqueous solution were determined using the batch adsorption
method by studying the effect of pH, contact time, initial ion concentration,
and temperature on adsorption. Pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order,
and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models were applied to study the
kinetics of the adsorption process, whereas Langmuir, Freundlich,
Temkin, and D-R models were applied to evaluate the thermodynamics
of the adsorption process. The kinetic adsorption parameters were
in best agreement with the pseudo-second-order model, while thermodynamic
parameters best fitted to the Langmuir isotherm at different temperatures for adsorption of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solution with a maximum
adsorption capacity of 142.95 mg/g at pH 5.5. CSECM showed excellent
regeneration capability and recovery of the Cu(II) ion up to five
cycles without the loss of the adsorption efficiency, which is the
best characteristic to select the appropriate choice of the adsorbent.
The adsorbent was also employed in batch experiments to evaluate the
adsorption of hardness, producing common metal ions in single and
real wastewater solutions.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Increasing industrialization
has led to serious ecosystem concerns
due to intake of excessive toxic pollutants into either underground
or exposed water bodies. Toxic pollutants in large quantities such
as heavy metal ions (copper, cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury),
dyes, etc., are discharged into the water bodies on a daily basis,
all of which are highly toxic to all forms of living systems at higher
concentration above the permissible limits proposed by the WHO. The
permissible limits of Cu(II) from industrial effluents is 0.25 mg/L,
whereas the permissible limit in the drinking water is 1.3 mg/L. Cu(II),
being the low-cost metal ion and with its extensive application in
various industries, is the most discharged heavy metal pollutant from
industries. Hence, degradation or removal of these toxic heavy metal
ions from wastewater is essential to save the biological life on Earth.1−5 Copper in bonded form, however, is essential as a cofactor for many
enzymes in low concentrations including cytochromes and in ceruloplasmin
(the major copper-carrying protein in blood), which reduces oxidative
stress, but it is toxic in its unbounded form. When its concentration
increases slightly, it results in impairment of zinc homeostasis,
which further causes disruption of antioxidant enzyme function and
finally increases oxidative stress.6 Deposition
of copper in hepatic parenchyma cells, brain, periphery of the iris,
and kidneys excessively causes serious disorders, such as Wilson’s
disease.7,8

Several methodologies have been implemented
for copper removal
such as professionally installed reverse osmosis,9 backwashing media filtration systems or an ion exchange
system,10−14 precipitated materials,15 carbon nanotubes,16 and biopolymeric membranes.17,18 Moreover, the electrochemical precipitation19 and adsorption are the most significant methods.20−25 Adsorption is one of the most cost-effective and environmentally
sustainable approach for decontamination of wastewater at a low concentration.26−28 Numerous materials ranging from inorganic composites to nature-derived
activated charcoal from various biomass have been evaluated for removal
of toxic pollutants dyes, heavy metal ions, organic pollutants, etc.
Although these materials have comparable removal efficiencies, however,
there are more disadvantages such as the source from which adsorbents
are derived, environmental sustainability, cost efficiency, regeneration
ability, and source renewability, which force the researchers for
further investigation and development of new adsorbent systems. Biopolymers
from natural resources, which are nontoxic, environment-friendly,
and renewable, provide an extensive ability to undergo chemical transformation
through simple cross-linking and condensation reactions due to the
presence of a large number of functional groups.29,30

All the techniques cited above compel toward the engineering
of
polymeric systems that are contacted with water for everyday functions
for the handling of wastewater for a variety of pollutants as researchers
are striving to improve the favorable surface interaction of polymers
with water bodies. Biopolymers provide an alternative by which surface
hydrophilicity and biodegradability can be introduced for acquiring
the environmental sustainability.

Among biopolymers, chitosan
and carboxymethyl cellulose have heteroatoms
such as nitrogen and oxygen in their backbones, which are exercised
for surface modification to increase the adsorption efficiency.31 In the present work, chitosan-carboxymethyl
cellulose-based adsorbent is synthesized through single-pot synthesis
in the presence of EDTA to modify the surface of the biopolymers,
which simultaneously increases the adsorption efficiency and mechanical
properties while decreasing their swelling on contact with wastewater.
Besides adsorption of Cu(II) ions, CSECM, furthermore, effectively
decreases the hardness of water by chelating the calcium and magnesium
ions. To fulfill the gap of knowledge, different studies were carried
out: (i) effect of pH, contact time, initial ion concentration, and
temperature; (ii) thermodynamics and kinetics, which were carried
out by using different models; (iii) applicability of data fit on
the basis of error analysis; and (iv) regeneration of CSECM and recovery
of the Cu(II), which are important characteristics to justify the
selection of the material; biodegradability test was also further
investigated by burying the worn-out samples into the soil.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Methods
Carboxymethyl
cellulose (low viscosity) was purchased from Sigma Lifescience, chitosan
(degree of deacetylation, ≥75%) was provided by HiMedia India,
and p-toluene sulfonyl chloride (TsCl) was purchased
from SDH Fine Chemicals (India). Copper nitrate was obtained from
Fisher Scientific India. EDTA (dipotassium salt), sodium hydroxide,
glacial acetic acid (99–100%), and phenolphthalein were purchased
from Merck India. Throughout the experiment, doubly distilled water
was used.

2.2 Preparation of Chitosan-EDTA-CMC (CSECM)
An effective protocol for waste-minimized, environmentally benign
thermal condensation of carboxylic acids with amines has been identified.32 One gram of chitosan (2 × 10–3 mol) was dissolved in 0.01 M acetic acid solution until a clear
solution was obtained; the solution was centrifuged several times
to remove the impurities. Similarly, solutions of CMC (0.524 g, 2
× 10–3 mol) and EDTA (1.168 g, 4 × 10–3 mol) were prepared in doubly distilled water. Initially,
the EDTA solution was mixed with TsCl in the molar ratio of 1:2 to
obtain the tosylated form of EDTA in a three-necked round-bottom (RB)
flask. The solutions of CS and CMC were added simultaneously to the RB
flask containing the tosylated EDTA solution, at one drop per 30 s. The contents of the RB flask were kept on continuous stirring for
72 h at 80 °C until the reaction was complete as slightly higher
temperatures are required for challenging the starting materials.
The product was precipitated out as such in the reaction vessel due
to intense intramolecular hydrogen bonding, washed several times with
distilled water, and dried in oven at 50 °C. The approach leads
to the corresponding esters in good yields (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Representative Reaction Pathway
2.3 Characterization of Materials
2.3.1 Degree of Epoxy Content
The number
of epoxy groups formed in the product was determined by the titration
method using acetone/hydrochloride (1:1) solution.33 HCl reacts with the adsorbent and causes the protonation
of the epoxy groups. The remaining H+ concentration is
determined by titration of the solution with NaOH using phenolphthalein
as an indicator. The number of equivalents of H+ reacted
is equal to the number of epoxy groups in the adsorbent. 1  where V0 (mL) and Vf (mL) is the volume
of NaOH consumed by acetone/HCl solution before and after reaction
with the adsorbent, respectively, CNaOH (M) is the concentration of NaOH used in the titration, and Wg is the weight of the adsorbent in grams.

2.3.2 Characterization of CSECM Product
FTIR
was carried out by using a Bruker Tensor 37 spectrophotometer
by scanning the product in the wavelength range from 4000 to 500 cm–1. SEM micrographs were obtained by using an FEI Quanta
200 FESEM (50–50K X). XRD analyses were carried out with a
D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker) with Cu target ƛ = 0.154
nm at 40 kV, and 2θ was 10°–80°.

The
crystallinity index was calculated using the equation 2  where I200 is the intensity at 2θ ≈ 20.72°,
and Im is the intensity of baseline at
2θ ≈
70.5°.

3 Results and Discussions
Adsorption parameters such as the effect of pH, initial ion concentration,
contact time, temperature, and rate of adsorption were evaluated through
the batch adsorption method. To maintain the criterion of optimality,
an entire set of the experimental parameter(s) were varied individually
one by one, keeping the remaining ones as fixed. A series of solutions
with concentrations varying from 100 to 200 ppm, an adsorbent dose
of 100 mg, temperature ranging from 303 to 323 K, contact time of
10 to 80 min, and pH from 3 to 8 were prepared; 10 mL of each solution
was used for the adsorption study; and thus, effective optimization
of each parameter is achieved for the best results.

Both naturally
occurring and synthetic compounds widely consist
of the amide bond linkages. There is considerable interest in the
development of new approaches to direct amidation. In the presented
work, there is a focus on the development of novel, atom-economic,
environmentally benign methods for this process in engineering newer
combinations of biopolymers for designing the technologies for wastewater
treatment. An important consideration here is the direct thermal amide
formation from the naturally occurring amines present in chitosan
and carboxylic acid in CMC (Scheme 1). Importantly, a solid-phase purification procedure
is reported that enables the product to be obtained without aqueous
workup or chromatography, henceforth, the simplicity in separating
the reagents from the resulting products. The overall synthetic procedure
follows a maximum criterion toward green technology developments.

The presence of amine and hydroxyl groups both in chitosan and
CMC is responsible for the adsorption feature in the polymer backbone.
EDTA had been reported to have strong chelation with the metal ions
as a hexadentate ligand34,35 and generally employed
in the determination of hardness of water by complexometric titrations
among the crude experiments.36 Thus, as
a result of chelation of heavy metal ions, the CSECM can effectively
remove the hardness of water via coordination with calcium and magnesium
ions from their salts responsible for hardness. CSECM hypothetically
must show strong affinity for positively charged heavy metal ions.
This procedure is more convenient for general use and could be potentially
used in establishing its employment in removing not only copper but
the other common ions from the wastewater discharges (Table 1).

3.1 Structure Characterization
3.1.1 Quantitative
Estimation of Epoxy Content
The titration used for determination
of epoxy groups using HCl/acetone
solution was carried out three times simultaneously under similar
laboratory conditions. Calculations using eq 1 revealed that the epoxy groups in the product
were ∼0.15 mmol g–1.

3.1.2 FTIR Characterization
FTIR spectra
of chitosan, CMC, CSECM, and metal-loaded adsorbent are shown in Figure 1. The major differences
in the FTIR spectra of CS, CMC, and CSECM among the appearance of
the bands are at 1705 cm–1, 1686 cm–1, 1157 cm–1, 897 cm–1, and other
bands in the fingerprint region. The peak at 1705 cm–1 can be assigned to C=O due to stretching vibration of the
ester group formed by reaction of the carboxyl group of EDTA and the
hydroxyl group of CMC, while the bands appearing at 1399, 1580, and
1650 cm–1 appear due to C–N stretching, N–H
bending, and C–O stretching of amide vibrations, respectively.49 Absorption bands appearing at 1624 and 1481
cm–1 are likely due to asymmetrical stretching of
C–O of the carboxylate group.50,51

Figure 1 FTIR spectrum
of (a) CS, (b) CMC, (c) CSECM, and (d) metal-loaded
CSECM.

Furthermore, the bands appearing
in the fingerprint region, particularly
at 1152 and 899 cm–1, are attributed to the glycosidic
bridge. The bands appearing at 1036, 1020, 1052, and 1036 cm–1 are the characteristic C–O–C stretching vibrations
of the glucopyranose ring. Besides, the bands at 3400, 3200, 3000,
and 2850 cm–1 are the characteristic peaks of −NH2, −OH, C−H, and α C-H (next to carbonyl
group of ester) stretching vibrations appearing in all the FTIR spectra,
respectively. However, a slight shift toward lower frequency in the bands of the
metal-adsorbed adsorbent can be assigned to the adsorption of metal
ion, leading to slight reduction in frequency.35,52−54

3.1.3 SEM and EDAX Characterization
The
surface morphologies of all the reactants and products are reported
in Figure 2a. As observed
from the figure above, both CMC and chitosan have smooth and nonporous
surfaces; however, the surface of the adsorbent appears to be porous
and granular with increased surface area, which certainly enhances
the adsorption.

Figure 2 (a) SEM micrographs of (i) CMC, (ii) CS, (iii) CS-ES-CMC,
and (iv)
CSECM-Cu(II) (2000× magnification) and (b) EDX micrographs of
(i) CSECM and (ii) CSECM-Cu(II).

The elements present in the adsorbent CSECM were detected by EDAX,
as shown in Figure 2b. The peak heights resemble the relative concentrations of metals.
The EDAX spectrum confirms the presence of copper ions on the surface
of the adsorbent besides C, N, and O, which are the main constituents
of the adsorbent.

3.1.4 XRD Characterization
The XRD patterns
of chitosan, CMC, and CSECM are given in Figure 3. In chitosan, the diffraction maximum at
2θ = 20.25 is characteristic of the crystalline form of chitosan
with a crystallinity index of ∼76.57%, while that of CMC at
20.45 is 81.36% due to the lesser crystalline nature of CMC. However,
in CSECM, the diffraction maximum at 2θ = 21.05 has a crystallinity
index of 94.89%, which indicates the higher crystallinity of CSECM. The higher crystallinity
index indicates the ordered structure of the CSECM probably due to
cross-linking.

3.1.5 Thermal Stability of
CS, CMC, and CSEM
Figure 4 shows the
thermogram of the cross-linked adsorbent (CSECM) and the biopolymers
CS and CMC from which it was synthesized; as evident from the figure,
the adsorbent CSECM is thermally more stable than the corresponding
biopolymers from which it was synthesized. The degradation of chitosan
begins at 10 °C with 30% loss, whereas that of CMC starts at
250 °C with 60% degradation. In comparison, the degradation of
CSECM starts at 170 °C with just 10% loss, making it thermally
more stable than the native material from which it is synthesized.55,56

3.1.6 XPS Analysis
XPS analysis was carried
out on the adsorbent before and after adsorption to account for the
adsorbent surface, as shown in Figure 5. The high-resolution full survey spectrum of the adsorbent shows
the peaks at 40.5, 289.9, 399.6, and 534.17 eV, which correspond to
O2s, C1s, N1s, and O2s, respectively; however, the spectrum of the
adsorbent after copper adsorption shows an extra peak at 932.5 eV,
which corresponds to Cu2p.57 The peaks
of Cu(II) in the XPS spectrum confirm its surface deposition on the
adsorbent. The binding energy peaks of O1s at 531.60 and 534.09 eV
in the high-resolution XPS spectrum correspond to C=O and C–O
of the carbonyl and hydroxyl moieties in CSECM, respectively. Furthermore,
a slight shift in these peaks can be observed clearly in the XPS spectrum
after Cu(II) adsorption, which suggests the involvement of these functional
groups in the Cu(II) adsorption.58,59

3.1.7 Surface Charge Analysis by Zero Point Charge
Zero point charge (ZPC) is the pH at which the net charge on the
surface of the adsorbent is zero. Below the pHZPC, the
surface of the adsorbent becomes positively charged, whereas above
pHZPC, the adsorbent surface is negatively charged. The
mechanism of adsorption however does not depend only on pHZPC, but there are other factors that affect the adsorption of species
onto the adsorbent. To determine the pHZPC of CSECM, salt
addition method60 was used in which a series
of 10 mL flasks containing 0.5 mg of CSECM were filled with 50 mL
of 0.1 M KNO3 and the initial pH was adjusted from 1 to
12 using 0.1 M HCl and 0.1 M NaOH. The flasks were kept on a constant-temperature
water bath and left for 24 h. The supernatant solution was filtered,
and final pH was determined using a pH meter. The pH of the solutions
affects the ionization of the different pollutants as well as the
surface of the adsorbent. The pHZPC was obtained to be
5.4 from the plot of ΔpH versus initial pH (Figure 6).61

Figure 6 Zero
point charge plot of CSECM.

3.2 pH Effect on Adsorption of Cu(II) Ions
The pH of a solution is the main factor that affects all other parameters
of adsorption behavior by influencing the surface properties of the
adsorbent as well as association/dissociation of the adsorbate molecules.62 The variation of adsorption of Cu(II) ions on
CSECM with pH is shown in Figure 7a. As clearly shown from the plot, initially, when
pH is increased from 3 to 5.5, the H3O+ ion
concentration decreases in the solution, rendering the surface of
the adsorbent more negative as depicted by zero point charge, thereby
increasing the vacant adsorption sites, which results in increased
adsorption of Cu(II) ions onto the adsorption sites, attaining maximum
adsorption at pH 5.5. However, increasing the pH beyond 5.5 does not
yield an increase in adsorption of metal ions probably due to equilibrium
as well as competition between metal ions and H3O+. Increasing pH above 7.0 leads to formation of metal hydroxides,
which are highly stable and preferentially formed, resulting in decreased
adsorption.63

Figure 7 Effect of (a) pH {contact
time: 60 min; temperature: 303 K; CSECM;
100 mg}, (b) contact time {pH: 5.5; temperature: 303 K; CSECM; 100
mg}, and (c) initial concentration on adsorption of Cu(II) ions on
CSECM {pH: 5.5; CSECM; 100 mg}.

3.3 Contact Time Effect on Adsorption of Cu(II)
Ions
The variation of adsorption with contact time is shown
in Figure 7b. Contact
time is the major parameter used for the evaluation of the kinetics
of the adsorption process.64 Initially,
all the sites on the adsorbent are vacant, and hence, with increasing
contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate, the interactions
result in an increase in the uptake of Cu(II) ions until the adsorption
equilibrium is reached at 40 min. After 40 min, there is no net increase
in adsorption as the amount of Cu(II) ions adsorbed equals the amount
of Cu(II) ions desorbed.65

3.4 Initial Concentration Dependence of Adsorption
Initial
concentration of adsorbate plays an important role in studying
the kinetics of adsorption. For studying the effect of initial concentration
of the adsorbate, different concentrations of Cu(II) ion, 50, 100,
150, and 200 ppm, were taken at different temperatures: 303, 313,
and 323 K. It was observed that, with higher initial concentration,
the higher quantity of Cu(II) ion was adsorbed by the adsorbent at
equilibrium (Figure 7c). This can be attributed to the fact that, with higher initial
ion concentration, the probability of the adsorbent–adsorbate
interaction increases exponentially, thereby resulting in increased
adsorption.66

3.5 Kinetic
Study
For understanding the
kinetic behavior of the adsorption of Cu(II) ion onto CSECM, different
models were used to correlate the adsorption process. Generally, linear
forms of the models are used for obtaining the plots of pseudo-first-order,
pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion models (eqs 3–5; Figure 8) from which
the maximum adsorption capacities and other parameters are calculated.67−69 The model that explains the adsorption in the best way is obtained
by comparing the correlation coefficients (R2), as shown in Table 2. 3   4   5  where qe and qt (mg g–1) are the adsorption capacities at equilibrium and at time t, respectively, k1 and k2 (g mg–1 min–1) are the first- and second-order rate constants, and Kid(mg g–1 min1/2) and C are the intraparticle diffusion rate constants. The results
of the plots are summarized in Table 2. On comparing R2 values,
the adsorption of Cu(II) ions onto CSECM is best explained by the
pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.993,
0.999, and 1.000 at temperatures of 303, 313, and 323 K, respectively)
than the other two models, suggesting that the adsorption of Cu(II)
ions follows the second-order kinetics.

pseudo-first-order, (b) pseudo-second-order,
and (c) intraparticle diffusion models for adsorption of Cu(II) ion

constant and equilibrium adsorption capacity, respectively.

3.6 Adsorption Isotherms
For establishing
the relation between the amounts of adsorbate molecules adsorbed at
constant temperature, different models are used. In the present study,
four models, Langmuir model, Freundlich model, Temkin model, and D-R
model, were applied to interpret the results for the adsorption of
Cu(II) ions onto CSECM in the best possible way (Table 3).

The Langmuir model70 is given as eq 7 (Figure 9a) and assumes that one molecule is adsorbed
per site of the adsorbent and the energy of adsorption is constant. 7  where qe (mg g–1) and qm (mg g–1) are
the adsorption capacity at equilibrium
and maximum adsorption capacity, respectively, while Ce (mg L–1) is the concentration at equilibrium. KL (L mg–1) is the Langmuir
constant determined from the slope of the plot between  and , also known
as the binding energy of adsorption.

Figure 9 Plots of (a) Langmuir, (b) Freundlich,
(c) Temin, and (d) D-R isotherms
for adsorption of Cu(II) ions at temperatures of 303, 313, and 323
K.

Freundlich adsorption is based
on the concept of nonuniform distribution
of heat of adsorption over a heterogeneous surface and multilayer
adsorption. The linear form of the Freundlich model (Figure 9b) is given as71 8  where Ce (mg L–1) and qe(mg g–1) are the concentration
and adsorption capacity
at equilibrium, respectively. The constants KF and n represent the adsorption capacity
and adsorption intensity, respectively.

The Temkin isotherm72 (Figure 9c) also describes the adsorption
behavior of the heterogeneous systems and is given as 9  where qe and Ce have the usual meaning
as noted earlier, and bT (J mol–1) and AT (L mg–1) are
the Temkin constants for binding energy and heat of adsorption, respectively.
The adsorption potentials AT calculated
from the intercept of the plot qe versus
ln Ce are 0.640, 0.649, and 0.653 at temperatures
of 303, 313, and 323 K, respectively, indicate lower binding constants.
The values of bT at temperatures of 303,
313, and 323 K are 2.601, 1.846, and 1.745 kJ mol–1, respectively, as determined from the slope, are directly proportional
to the heat of adsorption, indicating the physisorption characteristics
of the sorption. The positive values of bT correspond to the exothermic nature of the adsorption process.

Relation between the porous structure and adsorption by the adsorbent
is explained by the Radushkevich and Dubinin model (Figure 9d) given in linear form73,74 as 10  where qe, qm, and Ce have the usual meaning
as noted earlier, and β (mol2 kJ–2) is the constant related to the mean
free energy of adsorption E (kJ mol–1) as 11  

The constants
β and qm were determined
from the slope and intercept, respectively. The values of E between 8 and 16 kJ mol–1 suggest the
occurrence of physisorption, while the values higher than 16 kJ mol–1 correspond to chemical adsorption. In the current
study for adsorption of Cu(II) onto the CSECM adsorbent, the values
of E are calculated as 1.207, 1.303, and 0.950 at
temperatures 303, 313, and 323 K, respectively. The best fit model
cannot only be decided from the linearization of the plots, but various
error analysis parameters (Table 4) are also used for choosing the best fit model. In
this study, the Langmuir model best fits the adsorption of Cu(II)
ion on the CSECM adsorbent with R2 equal
to 0.991 and the lowest values for statistical error analyses. Furthermore,
the experimental values calculated for qm have the highest value for the Langmuir isotherm, as shown in Figure 9b.

3.7 Adsorption
Thermodynamics
The feasibility
and the physiochemical characteristics were determined by evaluation
of thermodynamic parameters. The change in free energy, enthalpy,
and entropy on the adsorption of Cu(II) ions onto the adsorbent was
evaluated by using the van’t Hoff equation75 12   13   14  where ΔGo, ΔHo, and ΔSo are the standard free energy, enthalpy, and
entropy of adsorption respectively, R is the gas
constant (∼8.314 J K–1 mol–1), T is the temperature, and KC is the equilibrium constant, while qe and Ce are the adsorption capacity
at equilibrium and equilibrium concentration, respectively.

The values of ΔHo and ΔSo were determined from the slope and intercept
of the van’t Hoff plot of ln KC versus  (Figure 10 and Table 5). The increasing negative values of Gibbs free energies obtained
at different temperatures correspond to the spontaneous nature of
the adsorption process, whereas the increasing negative ΔGo values with increasing temperature suggest that adsorption
of Cu(II) ions increased with temperature. As reported in the literature,
the ΔGo values up to −20
kJ mol–1 for the adsorption process are usually
assigned to the physisorption process that usually occurs due to electrostatic
interaction between the groups on the adsorbent and the adsorbate
molecules/ions.68,76 In the current study, the values
of ΔGo are −12.33, −12.82,
and −13.32 kJ mol–1 at temperatures of 303,
313, and 323 K, respectively, suggesting the physisorption of Cu(II)
ions onto the adsorbent. The positive value of ΔHo (2.732 kJ mol–1) corresponds to the
endothermic nature of the adsorption process, which is further supported
by the increase in negative ΔGo values
with temperature. The positive value of ΔSo (49.718 J mol–1 K–1)
indicates the interaction of adsorbate molecule/ions at the interface
of solid–liquid junction.

3.8 Mechanism of Cu(II) Ion
Adsorption
The adsorption of metal ion onto the adsorbent
can occur through
a number of possible interactions at the interface of the adsorbent,
which include coordination of metal ion by the functional groups (−OH,
−NH2, −SH, and COO–), electrostatic
interactions, or ion exchange. Biopolymers contain high density of
functional groups such as −OH, −NH2, and
−COO–, which can be further increased by
cross-linking two different biopolymers using an appropriate cross-linker.
In the current work, the adsorption of Cu(II) ion onto CSECM can be
explained properly by FTIR (Figure 1) and XPS (Figure 4) analysis. From the FTIR spectrum of the CSECM before
and after adsorption in Figure 1, it is clearly evident that there is only a slight change
in the stretching vibrations of −NH2 and −OH
bands, which indicates that there are no coordination linkages between
−NH2/–OH and Cu(II) ion, negating the removal
of Cu(II) ions through complexation. Furthermore, slight changes in
the stretching frequencies of −NH2/–OH indicate
the strong electrostatic interaction of these groups with the Cu(II)
ions.77 These results were further supported
by the data of XPS analysis. The increase in the binding energy of
−NH2 before and after the adsorption of Cu(II) ion
by CSECM shows the strong interaction between −NH2 and Cu(II) due to the fact that the electron density on the N atom
decreases on interaction with Cu(II) ion.78 Similar changes in binding energies can be noticed in the XPS spectra
of C–C, C–O, and C=O.58

3.9 Desorption Studies
The adsorption–desorption
behavior is an important factor to evaluate the efficiency, regeneration
capacity, recovery, reusability, and the economic benefits of the
synthesized adsorbent.79,80 To evaluate the reusability,
0.01 M EDTA solution was used for desorption characteristics of CSECM.
The adsorbent with maximum Cu(II) ions adsorbed on it was treated
several times with 0.01 M EDTA solution, and complete desorption of
Cu(II) ions was obtained in just five adsorption–desorption
cycles shown in Figure 11. The results were verified in three concurrent measurements,
and it was found that the adsorbent was regenerated completely.

cycles of Cu(II) ion onto CSECM.

3.10 Soil Biodegradability Test
For testing
the soil degradability of the synthesized adsorbent, it was buried
under the soil for 50 days, and the samples were characterized by
SEM analysis, as shown in Figure 12a,b. It was observed that the synthesized adsorbent
began to decompose within 20 days from burial under the soil. The
weight of the sample was taken every second day, and the graph (Figure 12c) plotted shows
the degradation behavior.

and (b) after burial.

4 Conclusions
In the present study, a biodegradable-cum-compostable
EDTA-modified
CS-CMC biopolymer-based adsorbent has been prepared. The exquisiteness
of the designed polymer as an adsorbent for copper(II) removal is
a one-pot approach in synthesizing it. Further, the distinctive addition
is the lessening of the hardness of the water under assessment. CSECM
is prepared from natural biopolymers chitosan and CMC by cross-linking
them with EDTA and characterized by FTIR, XRD, and SEM/EDX. The adsorption
parameters were evaluated by using the batch adsorption method, and
adsorption equilibrium was obtained in 40 min at pH 5.5 with a removal
efficiency of 142.95 mg/g. The kinetics of the experimental values
were fitted with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model
for understanding the thermodynamics of the adsorption process with
a higher adsorption of 142.86 mg/g for Cu(II) than the other adsorbents.
Adsorption–desorption studies showed that CSECM was completely
regenerated up to five cycles using 0.01 M EDTA with the loss of adsorption
efficiency to a larger extent. Keeping in view the economic perspective
as well as the environmental sustainability, CSECM can be efficiently
used for removal of Cu(II) ions from wastewater. This material extracts
the copper out of wastewater, thereby helping the environment sustainability
toward generating reusable water and producing fertilizers, increasing
the soil fertility post-use dump. It is assumed that the material,
by treating the copper containing hard water, will help in protecting
the water resources, spurring toward the appropriate, cost-effective,
and easily available solutions.
