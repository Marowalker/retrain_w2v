To improve the properties
of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), a series of poly[(butylene succinate)-co-poly(tetramethylene glycol)]s (PBSTMGs) with different
poly(tetramethylene glycol) (PTMG) contents were successfully prepared
by the catalyzed melt polycondensation process. The effect of introducing
flexible PTMG segments on the properties was investigated, and they were compared
to those of PBS. The differential scanning calorimetry results indicated
that the melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and crystallinity
of PBSTMG copolymers were slightly lower than those of PBS. Furthermore,
these thermal parameters decreased gradually with the increase of
PTMG content. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that there was a
significant decline of storage modulus (E′)
in the overall temperature range of copolymers compared to that of PBS. The incorporation of PTMG
did not modify the crystal lattice of PBS according to the wide-angle
X-ray diffraction analysis. Because of copolymerization, the size
of the spherulites was reduced at high PTMG contents. The soft domain
in the copolymers might contribute to the enhanced tear strength of
PBSTMG. The elongation at break and impact strength of PBSTMG copolymers
were greatly improved as a result of the phase separation structure
and lower degree of crystallinity. Especially, when the PTMG content
was 10 mol %, the impact strength of the copolymer reached up to 4.5
times that of PBS. In addition, with more soft segments introduced,
the biodegradability of the copolymers became much better than that
of PBS.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In
recent years, the environmentally friendly and biodegradable
polymers have aroused wide concern because of their potential to substitute
nonbiodegradable materials. Biodegradable polymers can be degraded
into small molecules, water and carbon dioxide, by microorganisms
and therefore diminish the problem of environmental pollution caused
by the disposal of common plastics.1 On
the other hand, with the current increasing demand of global energy
and petrochemical products, polymer materials obtained from renewable
biomass resources have attracted more and more attention.

A
variety of biodegradable polymers,2 such
as poly(lactic acid) (PLA),3 polycaprolactone
(PCL),4 and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB),5 have already been found to be widely applicable
in the fields of packaging, agriculture, and drug delivery.6 Nevertheless, the applications of aliphatic polyesters
are limited7 owing to their poor mechanical
properties; thus, chemical and physical modifications are particularly
important. Among these polymers, poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is
a typical biodegradable polyester that can be derived from biomass-based
resources and exhibits balanced performance in thermal and mechanical
properties.8−11 However, its high crystallinity, slow crystallization rate, and
low melt strength and tear strength are the main shortcomings during
processing and usage. To meet the different requirements of industries,
PBS can be copolymerized with other diacids and diols to regulate
the properties.12−17

Some prior reports have18,19 revealed that the biodegradability
of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) became
worse with the incorporation of aromatic units. Among the factors
affecting biodegradability,20−22 the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
balance is influenced by the chemical structure and composition of
repeating units; thus, the biodegradability of polyesters will be
enhanced by increasing the hydrophilicity. One approach is to introduce
hydrophilic segments such as polyethers into the molecular backbone
to form block copolymers. The mechanical properties of the block copolymers
will be affected by unit types, compositional proportions, and soft
segment lengths. Kricheldorf et al.23 blended
PCL with polyamide and polyethylene so as to improve the mechanical
properties. In addition, Albertsson et al.24 have applied poly(ether sulfone)–PTMG copolymers as surgical
sutures and drug carriers for their excellent performance.

Copolymerization
is an effective modification method to achieve
the purpose of reducing the crystallinity, adjusting the degradation
rate, and increasing the ductility of PBS. The comonomers can be diacids
and diols, including adipic acid, terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol,
1,3-propanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and so on. The crystallinity of copolymers
upon introducing
these comonomers is lower than that of PBS, leading to higher ductility.

Djonlagic et al.22 synthesized poly(butylene
adipate-co-butylene succinate) by melt polycondensation
and studied the impact of copolymerization on the mechanical properties
and biodegradability. The toughness and biodegradability of the copolymers
enhanced with the increasing content of adipic acid, whereas the melting
temperature and crystallinity decreased. Tsutsumi et al.25 investigated poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene terephthalate) by introducing terephthalic acid.
The highest degradation rate was observed with 20 mol % terephthalic
acid added to succinate acid. A conclusion was drawn in the work that
with more terephthalic acid added the glass-transition temperature
(Tg) and the mechanical properties of
the copolymer were improved and the melting temperature declined when
the molar ratio of terephthalic acid to succinate acid was less than
30%.

It has been reported that the biodegradability will be
reduced
when aliphatic polyesters copolymerized with nonbiodegradable polymers,
such as aliphatic–aromatic random copolyesters,26 but will not be significantly reduced with polyethers.
Nagata et al.27 synthesized PBS and poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) copolymers, where PEG molecular weight was in the range
from 200 to 2000 g/mol. With an increase in the PEG content, the hydrolysis
rate of the copolymer enhanced, whereas the melting temperature, crystallinity,
and elongation decreased. Although the biodegradability of the copolymer
was improved after the introduction of PEG, the material containing
the PEG component was unstable in nature, particularly when exposed
to sunlight.

Because of the high degree of crystallinity and
the molecular structure
of PBS itself, the tear strength and toughness of polyester materials
leave much to be desired for films, as well as the low impact strength,
seriously affecting the processability and mechanical property.28,29 For expanding the applications, it is very important and necessary
to strengthen the tear strength and toughness of PBS, while maintaining
the biodegradability. In this work, poly[(butylene succinate)-co-poly(tetramethylene glycol)] (PBSTMG) copolymers were
synthesized by melt polycondensation. PBS was used as the hard segment
and PTMG as the soft segment to prepare biodegradable polymers with
improved properties. By introducing PTMG, the tear resistance and
the impact strength of the copolymer were enhanced as a result of
the phase separation and lower degree of crystallinity. The relationship
between the properties of the copolymers and molar fraction of the
soft segments was evaluated, and their behavior was
compared to that of PBS.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Composition and Structure of PBSTMG Copolymers
The
synthesized PBSTMG copolymers with 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50,
60, and 70 mol % PTMG in the total diols were denoted PBSTMG-5, PBSTMG-10,
PBSTMG-15, PBSTMG-20, PBSTMG-30, PBSTMG-40, PBSTMG-50, PBSTMG-60,
and PBSTMG-70, respectively. The structural formula of PBSTMG and
the 1H NMR spectrum of PBSTMG-5 are presented in Scheme 1 and Figure 1. Figure 1 shows the proton peaks (c, δ = 1.62–1.71
ppm; b, δ = 4.12 ppm) originating from the methylene group of
1,4-butanediol. The peaks at δ = 2.62 ppm corresponded to the
protons (a) in the methylene group of succinic acid (SA), and the
methylene protons (d) in PTMG linked to the ether bond showed the
peaks at δ = 3.41 ppm. On the basis of these results, the molecular
structure of PBSTMG was determined adequately.

of the copolymer with 5 mol % PTMG in
the total diols (PBSTMG-5).

Scheme 1 Structural Formula of PBSTMG
The composition of the copolymers was calculated from
the relative
intensities of the characteristic peaks of the SA repeating unit and
the methylene groups attached to the ether oxygen of PTMG. Thus, the
molar fraction of PTMG units in the synthesized copolymers was calculated
and the efficiency of the synthesis reaction could be obtained by
comparing with that of the initial feed ratio. The
calculation formula is as follows  where Ad and Aa are the integral peak areas of the corresponding
peaks. Nd = 52.56 and Na = 4 are the numbers of protons in the corresponding
units.

The theoretical and experimental PTMG molar fractions
of the synthesized
copolymers under different feed ratios are presented in Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, the molar content
of the PTMG unit in the copolymer was approximately the same as that
in the initial feed ratio. The ratios of PTMG/1,4-butanediol (BDO) were
slightly larger than those in the feed ratio, which was
due to the partial volatilization of the butylene glycol and the formation
of by-product tetrahydrofuran in the reaction.

The molecular weight
information of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers is
also listed in Table 1. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of all investigated copolymers indicated that the copolyesters
of high molecular weights were obtained by the synthetic method described
in this article.

2.2 Thermal Properties of PBSTMG
Copolymers
2.2.1 Melting and Crystallization Behavior Analysis
After the chemical structure of the PBSTMG copolymer was confirmed,
the melting and crystallization properties of PBS and PBSTMG were
studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Figure 2 shows the first cooling curves
and second heating curves of the copolymers. The thermodynamic parameters
are summarized in Table 2. Compared to that of PBS, the melting temperature of PBSTMG copolymers
decreased from 114.1 °C for PBS to 78.8 °C for PBSTMG-20.
The experimental data indicated that with the increasing PTMG content,
the melting temperature, crystallization temperature, and crystallinity
of PBSTMG declined gradually.

curves at a cooling rate of 10 °C/min and (b) second heating
curves at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

Table 2 Thermal Properties and Crystallinity
of PBS and PBSTMG Copolymers
sample	Tm (°C)	Tc (°C)	Tg1 (°C)a	Tg2 (°C)a	ΔHm (J/g)	ΔHc (J/g)	Xc (%)b	
PBS	114.1	75.7	–22.9	 	66.9	62.3	60.5	
PBSTMG-5	105.6	61.8	–42.9	 	57.5	51.2	52.0	
PBSTMG-10	101.1	58.0	–56.7	–26.0	50.3	49.7	45.5	
PBSTMG-15	82.1	47.2	–63.8	–26.7	24.6	27.7	25.1	
PBSTMG-20	78.8	47.1	–67.4	–31.4	20.0	16.1	14.6	
a The glass-transition temperature
(Tg) was adopted from the tan δ
peak measured by dynamic thermal analysis.

b The degree of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated from the DSC results.

When the molar fraction of the PTMG
component reached 20%, the
crystallization peak became less obvious, with the corresponding melting
peak inconspicuous, and the crystallization ability was greatly weakened,
which implied that the copolymerization affected the crystallinity
of the polymers to a great degree. As the PTMG content increased,
the crystallinity was reduced considerably.

For a typical PBS-based
copolymer, the introduction of the third
monomer resulted in a significant impact on the melting point and
crystallinity. Through copolymerization, the sequence length of crystallizable
segments became shorter and the foreign units were excluded from the
crystal lattice. The lamella thickness of PBS turned to be thinner
with the incorporation of more comonomers. Thus, the melting point
and crystallinity of copolymers decreased gradually with the increasing
content of the third monomer.

2.2.2 Thermal
Stability Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was used to study the thermal stability, which is very
important for manufacture and application. Figure 3 presents the typical TGA curves of PBS and
PBSTMG copolymers in a nitrogen atmosphere.

Figure 3 TGA curves of PBS and
PBSTMG copolymers in a nitrogen atmosphere
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

From Figure 3, it
could be found that the classic one-step degradation curves were obtained
for all samples. The TGA curves of PBSTMG copolymers and PBS were
quite similar in shape, indicating that there was no significant difference
in the mechanism of thermal degradation. The series of decomposition
temperatures of PBSTMG were not much different from those of PBS,
which meant that copolymerization had no serious impact on the thermal
stability of copolymers.

2.3 Crystalline
Structure Analysis
2.3.1 Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction
Analysis (WAXD)
To get further information on the factors
affecting the physical
properties of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers, WAXD was adopted to confirm
the crystalline structure and crystallinity of the samples. It has
been reported30 that PBS shows monoclinic
α-form crystals with unit cell: a = 0.523 nm, b = 0.908 nm, c = 1.079 nm, β = 123.87°,
and the diffraction peaks of crystal planes appear at 19.4° (020),
21.5° (021), 22.5° (110), and 28.8° (111). The X-ray
diffraction diagrams of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers showed diffraction
peaks at 19.6, 21.8, 22.7, and 29.1°, as revealed in Figure 4. Both PBS and PBSTMG
copolymers exhibited almost the same positions of the peaks in the
diffractograms. These results confirmed that copolymerization with
PTMG did not modify the type of the crystal lattice, characteristic of PBS,
and PBSTMG crystallites had a monoclinic crystal structure similar
to that of PBS.

Figure 4 X-ray diffraction diagrams of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers
with different
contents of PTMG.

As the PTMG content increased,
the peaks at each position became
less conspicuous. The WAXD analysis indicated that the crystallinity
of copolymers decreased gradually with the incorporation of more PTMG,
which was in correspondence with the results of DSC.

2.3.2 Polarizing Microscope Analysis
Polarizing optical microscopy
(POM) was performed to investigate
the spherulite morphology of all copolymers. Figure 5 shows the optical micrographs of the isothermally
crystallized PBS and PBSTMG copolymers. There were obvious differences
between the spherulite morphologies of PBS and PBSTMG. In addition
to the obvious Maltese Cross, POM images of PBS revealed the larger
size of spherulites, which consisted of circular bright and gray birefringent
bands. Banded spherulites were ubiquitous in polyesters and generally
thought to be the result of regular twists of the lamellar crystals.11

PBSTMG-15,
and (e) PBSTMG-20 isothermally crystallized at the degree of undercooling
of 40 °C.

The phenomenon of banded
spherulites was more pronounced in PBSTMG-5
crystals. With the increasing PTMG content, the size of spherulites
became increasingly smaller, as presented in Figure 5. Finally, PBS hard segments dispersed in
the amorphous phase at 20 mol % PTMG content and the hard segments
played a role of physical crosslinking.

2.4 Dynamic
Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
DMA was utilized to study the viscoelastic
properties of PBS and
PBSTMG copolymers. Storage modulus (E′) and
damping factor (tan δ) of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers are
plotted in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Temperature dependence of the (a) storage modulus and (b) damping
factor of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers.

The change of the PTMG content had a great influence on the
storage
modulus and glass-transition temperature. In the glassy state, the
molecular motion was restricted and hence the values of E′ for all copolymers were higher. The glass-transition temperature
could be obtained from Figure 6b. As the PTMG content increased, the loss peaks shifted to
the lower temperature and the shape of peaks became narrower. The
glass-transition temperature (Tg) of PBSTMG
copolymers decreased from −42.9 to −67.4 °C, as
shown in Table 2. The
curves of PBSTMG-10, PBSTMG-15, and PBETMG-20 all showed two loss peaks
in Figure 6, which
indicated the existence of phase separation in the copolymerization
system.31

2.5 Phase
Separation Structure Analysis
The phase separation structure
of the copolymer was due to the components
being thermodynamically immiscible or the crystallization of a certain
component. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images
in Figure 7 provided
convincing evidence of the phase separation structure, which was consistent
with the POM and DMA results. The spherulitic morphology observed
by POM demonstrated that the crystals still exhibited a continuous
phase even at a high PTMG content. When the PTMG content reached 10
mol %, the film formed two different phases in nanoscale. The bright
portion represented the crystalline regions, that is, PBS hard segments,
and the dark portion represented the amorphous phase, that is, PTMG
soft segments. The appearance of phase separation visually revealed
that PTMG indeed affected the crystallization kinetics of PBS and
the distribution of the particular structure would also influence
the mechanical properties to some extent.

2.6 Mechanical
Properties
Mechanical
property was one of the most important and basic performance of biodegradable
polyester materials. Table 3 illustrates the mechanical properties of PBS, PBSTMG copolymers,
and PBS-PBSTMG blends. PBS blended with 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt % PBSTMG,
which consisted of the same mass fraction of PBSTMG-5, PBSTMG-10,
PBSTMG-15, and PBSTMG-20, are denoted PBS-5%PBSTMG, PBS-10%PBSTMG,
PBS-20%PBSTMG, and PBS-30%PBSTMG, respectively. The tensile strength
of the PBSTMG copolymers was reduced compared to that of PBS. When
the content of PTMG was 10 mol % or less, the tensile strength of
materials still reached more than 30 MPa. In addition, the elongation
at break and impact strength of PBSTMG were greatly improved with
an increase in the PTMG content. Especially, when the PTMG content
was 10 mol %, the impact strength of the copolymer was about 4.5 times
that of PBS.

Table 3 Mechanical Properties of PBS, PBSTMG
Copolymers, and PBS-PBSTMG Blends

PBSTMG-5	30.5	505	22.2

PBS-30%PBSTMG	34.4	379	16.7	
a Specimens cannot be ruptured.

There was a significant increase
in toughness, elongation, and
impact strength of PBSTMG. The results indicated that an appropriate
copolymerization ratio could reduce the size of spherulites and crystallinity
of polyesters, promote the formation of the phase separation structure,
and consequently enhance the toughness and ductility of copolymers,
as well as improving the impact strength of materials.

Furthermore, Table 3 also shows the mechanical
properties of PBS and PBSTMG blends. By
simply blending PBS with PBSTMG, the elongation at break and the impact
strength of PBS-PBSTMG blends were all improved to a certain extent
compared to those of PBS and the toughness of the blends was much
better as well.

PBS films and PBS-PBSTMG blend films were prepared
by the film
blowing process, the longitudinal direction along the blown film was
denoted the MD direction, and the transverse direction perpendicular
to the blown film was denoted the TD direction. As shown in Table S1, the mechanical properties of the PBS-PBSTMG
blend and PBS films were also studied. Except for the tensile strength
of PBS-10%PBSTMG (TD), all PBS-PBSTMG films had higher transverse
and longitudinal tensile strengths than those of PBS films, and the
elongation was also significantly improved. These results indicated
that the blending of PBS and PBSTMG greatly reinforced the mechanical
properties of films.

The tear strengths of PBS and PBS-PBSTMG
blend films are presented
in Table S2. From the data, it was found
that the blend films possessed a much better tear strength that PBS
films and especially the tear strength of PBS-30%PBSTMG films was
about 1.76 times that of PBS films. The films prepared by blending
PBS with PBSTMG showed excellent tear resistance property. These results
illustrated that the phase separation structure and the lower degree
of crystallinity present in copolymers hindered the growth of cracks
and thus the tear strength was improved macroscopically.

2.7 Biodegradation Properties
Biodegradability
is one of the most attractive and promising properties of PBS. The
chemical structure, morphology, and degradation conditions of PBS
and its copolymers had a great influence on the biodegradation rate.
To investigate the effect of the chemical structure of aliphatic copolyesters
on biodegradability, enzymatic degradation experiments were performed
with PBS and PBSTMG films (5 mm × 5 mm × 0.15 mm). The biodegradability
of the copolymers was characterized by the weight loss of the films
in a lipase solution, using the pure phosphate buffer for the blank
control tests.

The relationship between the content of PTMG
segments and the weight losses of PBS and PBSTMG films after both
enzymatic degradation and hydrolytic degradation (without lipase)
for 4 days is presented in Figure 8a. During the test time, the weight losses of PBS films
in the lipase solution and phosphate buffer were almost the same and
the presence of lipase only slightly promoted the degradation of PBS.
It could be observed that all PBSTMG films containing hydrophilic
soft segments showed a higher weight loss in both types of degradation
experiments and the biodegradation rates were significantly improved
compared with those of PBS. The introduction of PTMG resulted in the
increase of the hydrolysis rate of the copolymers, and the degradation
rate accelerated steadily with the addition of more PTMG. In the case
of enzymatic degradation, the weight loss was increased from 2.26%
of PBSTMG-5 to 14.00% of PBSTMG-20. Meanwhile, the degradation rates
of the copolymers in the lipase solution were higher than those in
the pure phosphate buffer. The above results could be attributed to
the introduction of soft segment PTMG, and the copolymers became more
flexible, which led to decreased crystallinity and improved hydrophilicity.
Therefore, the degradation rate of PBSTMG turned to be faster than
that of PBS. Among the comprehensive impacts on the biodegradability
of copolymers, the crystallinity was the main factor affecting the
degradation rate.

Figure 8 Weight losses of (a) PBS and PBSTMG films with different
contents
of PTMG after enzymatic degradation and hydrolytic degradation (without
lipase) for 4 days at 35 °C and (b) PBS and PBSTMG films in enzymatic
degradation tests for different days at 35 °C.

To gain more insight into the degradation behavior
of PBSTMG, the
enzymatic degradation experiments of PBS and PBSTMG films were carried
out for different days. It could be observed from Figure 8b that the weight losses of
the copolymers were all larger than those of PBS at different degradation
periods. On the one hand, for each sample, there was a distinct increase
in the weight loss when the degradation time was prolonged and later
the curves in Figure 8b became relatively flatter, which illustrated the decreased degradation
rate. On the other hand, when more content of PTMG was copolymerized,
the weight loss of PBSTMG was increased obviously and the enzymatic
degradation rate was improved. The results showed that with the introduction
of more soft segments, the biodegradability of the copolymers became
better. After 8 days of enzymatic degradation, the PBSTMG-20 films
had been partially decomposed into small pieces. The biodegradability
of the copolyesters was influenced by the hydrophilic–hydrophobic
equilibrium, and the degradation usually began in the amorphous region.
Because of the increase of the PTMG content, the flexibility and hydrophilicity
of the copolymer segments were gradually enhanced.

3 Conclusions
In this work, PBSTMG copolymers with different
PTMG contents were
successfully synthesized via introducing PTMG segments in PBS by melt
polycondensation. The chemical structure and composition of PBSTMG
obtained were confirmed by 1H NMR. The incorporation of
PTMG slightly reduced the melting temperature, crystallization temperature,
glass-transition temperature, and storage modulus of the copolymers
compared with those of PBS. Moreover, crystallinity of PBSTMG decreased
gradually with the increase of PTMG content. Phase separation of hard
segments and soft segments visually revealed that the introduction
of PTMG reduced the size of spherulites and crystallinity of polyesters
and indeed affected the mechanical properties of polymers. Regulated
by PTMG content, the elongation at break, impact strength, and flexibility
of the copolymers were significantly improved. Especially as films,
the tear strength of PBSTMG was greatly enhanced, which might be attributed
to the lower degree of crystallinity and the phase separation structure
that hinder the further growth of cracks. The increased hydrophilicity
and decreased crystallinity of the copolymers also resulted in the
accelerated biodegradation rate compared to that of PBS. To summarize,
all of the analyses on the thermal and mechanical properties and biodegradability
demonstrated that the PBSTMG copolymers could be used as biodegradable
polyesters for various applications.

from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd., China. All materials were used as received.

4.2 Synthesis of PBSTMG Copolymers
The
PBSTMG copolymers were prepared by melt polymerization in the bulk,
including esterification and polycondensation. The diol component
was used in a 20 mol % excess over the diacid component. As a result,
the polyester chains after esterification were terminated with diol
groups, and in the following polycondensation step, the terminal butanediols
would be removed by vacuum to form high-molecular-weight copolymers.
In addition, some butanediols would be partially volatilized and form
by-product tetrahydrofuran during the reaction. As an example, the
synthesis of PBSTMG with 10 mol % PTMG in the total diols was described.
A three-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet tube, a condenser,
and a mechanical stirrer was charged with 11.8 g (0.1 mol) of SA,
9.72 g (0.108 mol) of 1,4-butanediol, and 12.0 g (0.012 mol) of PTMG.

4.2.1 Esterification Step
The whole reaction
system was placed in a well-controlled-temperature oil bath, and the
system was purged with nitrogen. The reaction was carried out at 135
°C for 30 min to ensure that the reactants were fully dispersed
and melted and then the temperature was increased gradually to 215
°C (20 °C per 30 min). Finally, the system was maintained
at 225 °C for 4 h until there was no liquid distillated.

4.2.2 Polycondensation Step
At the second
stage, the system was cooled to 150 °C. The water separator and
the condenser were removed, 0.5 wt % Ti(OBu)4 was added
as a catalyst to the system, and the temperature was increased to
225 °C with continuous stirring. The system was then evacuated
to a pressure below 100 Pa for 4 h. The amount of PTMG soft segments
in the poly(ether–ester) chains varied between 5 and 70 mol
%.

4.3 Preparation of Blend Samples and Blowing Films
The samples were removed in a drying oven at 70 °C for 24
h before mixing. The blending mixing module of a Haake torque rheometer
was used, and the temperatures of three mixing stages were set at
150, 180, and 140 °C. The rotation speed was set as 20 min–1, and the mixing time was 20 min. After mixing, the
blends were stored at room temperature.

The film blowing process
was operated with the extrusion module of the Haake torque rheometer,
connected with a flat film extrusion head (die lip size: 0.75 mm ×
50 mm) and drafting roll device. The temperatures of the feed zone,
screw zone, die, and winding roll were 150, 180, 140, and 30 °C,
respectively. The rotation speed was 20 min–1, and
the speed of winding roll was about 150 cm/min. The blowing films
had an average width of 50 mm, and the thickness was in the range
of 0.035–0.075 mm.

4.4 Characterizations
1H NMR
(400 MHz) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution by a
Varian-Gemini-200 instrument with tetramethylsilane as the reference
standard. The concentration of each sample was about 5 wt % in the
solvent. Chemical shifts were presented in parts per million.

Thermal properties of PBSTMG copolymers were analyzed by Shimadzu
DSC-60 (Japan). Samples (3–5 mg) were placed in sealed aluminum
crucibles for the DSC tests. Each sample was first heated from room
temperature to 150 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, kept
at 150 °C for 3 min to eliminate thermal history, then cooled
to 30 °C at a cooling rate of 10 °C/min, held at 30 °C
for 3 min, and then reheated at the same rate to 150 °C. The
crystallinity of PBS and copolymers was calculated by the following
function: Xc = (ΔHm/ΔHθm) × 100%, where ΔHm is the
melting enthalpy of the sample and ΔHθm is the melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline PBS (ΔHθm = 110.5 J/g).32

TGA was performed on a Shimadzu DTG-60
thermogravimetric analyzer
(Japan) in a N2 atmosphere with the flow rate of 40 mL/min.
Each sample (3–5 mg) was placed in a sealed aluminum crucible
and heated from 30 to 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min,
using an empty aluminum crucible as reference.

WAXD analysis
was carried out at room temperature on a Rigaku SmartLab
X-ray diffractometer (Japan), using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 0.154 nm). Scanning was operated with 2θ from 5 to 40°
at a rate of 4°/min and a step interval of 0.02°.

The spherulitic morphology and nucleation behavior of samples were
observed under an Olympus BX41P POM (Japan). The samples were pressed
between two glass slides and melted at 160 °C for 5 min to erase
any thermal history and then quickly cooled to the crystallization
temperature for isothermal crystallization.

DMA was conducted
by the Anton Paar MCR301 stress/strain-controlled
rheometer (Austria) from −80 to 70 °C at a heating rate
of 4 °C/min, with the strain of 0.02% and a frequency of 1 Hz
in the tensile configuration.

AFM (Shimadzu SPM-9700) was utilized
to characterize the phase
separation and micromorphology of PBSTMG copolymers under the tapping
mode. The AFM specimens were prepared by casting 50 μL solution
of the centrifuged mixture on silicon and dried in a vacuum oven for
12 h to remove the residual solvent.

The tensile properties
of PBS and PBSTMG copolymers were tested
by a TS-2000 Gotech tester (Taiwan) at room temperature and at a crosshead
speed of 100 mm/min. The impact strength of the samples was measured
by a Jinjian XJUD-5.5 izod impact machine (China). All specimens were
stored at room temperature for 12 h before measurement.

The
tear strength is one of the important properties of films.
The GB/T 16578-1996 test method was applied in the experiment. The
film samples (Figure 9) prepared were of 150 mm × 50 mm with a 75 mm incision in the middle,
and the two edges of the trouser-like sample were clamped in the fixture
and then tear along the direction of the incision at a speed of 200
mm/min.

Figure 9 Schematic diagram of the tear strength test.

PBS and PBSTMG films for the enzymatic degradation test were
prepared
by hot pressing and stored at room temperature. The amano lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens was dissolved in the phosphate
buffer (pH 7.2–7.4) to obtain a 1 mg/mL enzyme solution, and
the enzyme-free phosphate buffer solution was used for blank control
experiments. The films (5 mm × 5 mm × 0.15 mm) were immersed
in degradation solutions and placed in a 35 °C shaking incubator.
The samples were removed from the degradation solution every 4 days,
rinsed with deionized water, and dried in a vacuum oven for 12 h at
room temperature. The degradation test was quantified as the weight
loss, and the degradation solution was changed with a freshly prepared
one after each measurement.
