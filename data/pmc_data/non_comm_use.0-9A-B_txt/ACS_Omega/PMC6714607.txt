Efficient
delivery of nucleic acids into cells still remains a
great challenge. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are DNA analogues with
a neutral backbone and are synthesized by solid phase peptide chemistry.
This allows a straightforward synthetic route to introduce a linear
short peptide (a.k.a. cell-penetrating peptide) to the PNA molecule
as a means of facilitating cellular uptake of PNAs. Herein, we have
devised a synthetic route in which a cyclic peptide is prepared on
a solid support and is extended with the PNA molecule, where all syntheses
are accomplished on the solid phase. This allows the conjugation of
the cyclic peptide to the PNA molecule with the need of only one purification
step after the cyclic peptide–PNA conjugate (C9–PNA)
is cleaved from the solid support. The PNA sequence chosen is an antimiR-155
molecule that is complementary to mature miR-155, a well-established
oncogenic miRNA. By labeling C9–PNA with fluorescein
isothiocyanate, we observe efficient cellular uptake into glioblastoma
cells (U87MG) at a low concentration (0.5 μM), as corroborated
by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and confocal
microscopy. FACS analysis also suggests an uptake mechanism that is
energy-dependent. Finally, the antimiR activity of C9–PNA
was shown by analyzing miR155 levels by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction and by observing a reduction in cell viability and
proliferation in U87MG cells, as corroborated by XTT and colony formation
assays. Given the added biological stability of cyclic versus linear
peptides, this synthetic approach may be a useful and straightforward
approach to synthesize cyclic peptide–PNA conjugates.

Introduction
Downregulation
of RNA by chemically modified oligonucleotides (ODNs)
has shown great promise in the clinic with recent FDA approvals of
several ODN-based drugs for the treatment of rare orphan diseases.
One such drug is Eteplirsen;1 a phosphorodiamidate
morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based exon-skipping drug (EXONDYS 51) that
is administered to children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD). Surprisingly, Eteplirsen is simply modified with a short polyethylene
glycol (PEG) linker and exerts therapeutic activity after systemic
administration. In recent years, there has been considerable effort
put forth to improve the therapeutic potential of PMOs by conjugating
specific cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (peptide–PMO conjugates).2 PMO is a DNA mimic that consists of a morpholine
ring that replaces the natural ribose. It has a neutral backbone and
therefore avidly binds complementary RNA as the electrostatic repulsion
between both strands (PMO and RNA) are nonexistent. Another DNA mimic
that has a neutral backbone is PNA (peptide nucleic acid).3

PNA is synthesized by peptide chemistry,
and therefore the introduction
of a CPP to either the C- or N-terminus of the PNA sequence is straightforward.4 In addition, as CPPs are typically positively
charged, there is less concern of electrostatic interactions between
the CPP and the PNA (as opposed to negatively charged ODNs).

In the context of cancer therapeutics, PNAs have been shown to
target cancer cells by (1) modulating splicing at the pre-mRNA level5 and by (2) sequestering oncogenic miRNAs6 and mRNAs.

In vivo, a guanidium backbone-modified
PNA was shown as an effective
antisense molecule targeting EGFr mRNA.7 In addition, a pH-responsive PNA conjugate (pHLIP) was shown as
an effective anticancer agent targeting the oncogenic miR-155 (antimiR
PNA).6a

CPPs are widely used for
the cellular delivery of therapeutic agents.
Peptides, however, are prone to degradation by peptidases and proteases.
To increase peptide stability, several approaches have been utilized,
such as the use of unnatural amino acids, d-amino acids,
and peptide cyclization.8 Peptide cyclization
for PNA delivery was recently reported by forming a hairpin structure
of a gamma-PNA–Tat peptide–gamma-PNA extended with a
gamma-PNA overhang. Using this approach, one may design other CPPs
on such a hairpin scaffold, thus avoiding the need for covalent peptide
cyclization.9 In an earlier study, PNA–cyclic
peptide conjugates were obtained on the solid support by the formation
of an S–S bond by designing peptides with selected positions
of cysteines on the peptide sequence.10

Herein, we have devised a synthetic methodology to synthesize
a
cyclic peptide (C9) that is conjugated to the PNA via a
classical amide bond where all syntheses are carried out on the solid
support. This cyclic CPP was reported in the literature as the one
that permeates cells by endocytosis and is by far more effective for
cellular delivery than classical CPPs such as Tat and nona-arginine
(R9).11 We have conjugated C9 to a PNA sequence that targets the mature form of oncogenic
miRNA-155. In this report, we have studied the cellular uptake and
biological activity of C9–PNA in glioblastoma cancer
cells (U87MG).

Results and Discussion
Peptide cyclization
on the solid support followed by on-resin PNA
synthesis was accomplished as described in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Solid-Phase Synthesis of C9–PNAs
The peptide of choice is 9-mer that is designed
in the following
manner: the amino acid at the C-terminus is l-lysine with
its ε-amine protected with a trityl group. This allows the extension
of the peptide via the α-amine and post on-resin cyclization,
the introduction of the PNA monomers at the ε-amine following
trityl group deprotection. The remaining 8-mer peptide is the peptide
that is then cyclized on the solid support. This cyclic peptide has
several features: (1) it has a hydrophobic (FfΦ, where Φ
= l-2-naphthylalanine, F = l-phe, and f = d-phe) and a hydrophilic (RrRr, four arginines with alternating chirality
of L and D) region; (2) it contains both natural and unnatural amino
acids (e.g., l-2-naphthylalanine); and (3) it has been reported
to be about 20-fold more efficient as a CPP in comparison to classical
CPPs such as Tat and nona-l-arginine (R9).11 Cyclization on the solid support is achieved
after selectively deprotecting the α-amine (Fmoc-protected)
of l-phe (F) and the α-carboxylic acid (allyl-protected)
of l-glu (E); both protecting groups are orthogonal to the
trityl group on the ε-amine of l-lys. Once these functional
groups are revealed, cyclization on the resin is carried out using
standard coupling reagents (2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl
uronium hexafluorophosphate methanaminium (HATU), hydroxybenzotriazole
(HOBT), and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA)).

As a PNA sequence,
we chose the one that is fully complementary
to the mature miR-155 oncogenic miRNA. In addition, we designed a
scrambled sequence to serve as a control (Table 1). This scrambled sequence consists of the
same amount of four PNA monomers (as anti-miR155 PNA) and the sequence
was found not to have a full complementarity to any human transcript,
as verified by BLAST analysis. An additional control was synthesized
that consisted of four d-lysines as the CPP. There were two
criteria for this choice: (1) this peptide has four positive charges
in physiological pH as does the cyclic C9 peptide (four
Arg); (2) this peptide is also stable in biological medium because
of the chirality (D) of all four amino acids. As an additional control,
dK4–PNA was also prepared with the scrambled PNA
sequence (Table 1).
dK4–PNA conjugates have also been previously reported
as cancer cell-permeable at a 1 μM concentration.12 Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling at
the N-terminus of both C9–PNA and dK4–PNA was carried out to allow us to follow the cellular uptake
of both PNAs that differ only in their peptide sequence (Table 1).

miR-155 is highly expressed in a variety of cancers.13 We chose glioblastoma cells (U87MG) as the means
to follow antimiR activity and cellular uptake of the PNA conjugates.
These cells express high levels of miR-155 and are not easy to transfect.14 To evaluate the antisense (antimiR) activity
of the PNA conjugates, we followed the effect of PNA conjugate incubation
with U87MG cells by following the expression levels of miR-155. As
shown by Gait and co-workers,15 PNA antimiRs
sequester mature miRNA in cells. Thus, isolating miRNAs from cells
after PNA treatment is anticipated to result in low levels of isolated
miRNA because of PNA sequestration (and not miRNA degradation). This
is related to the chemistry of PNA that does not evoke RNAse H activity.

U87MG cells were treated with either C9–PNA or
dK4–PNA (0.5 μM). Scrambled PNAs were also
tested as controls (C9–PNA-Scr or dK4–PNA-Scr). After 24 h, total miRNA was isolated and cDNA was
prepared from 1 μg of total miRNA using the qScript microRNA
cDNA Synthesis Kit. The expression of miR-155 was then evaluated by
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(in triplicates, Figure 1).

Figure 1 miR-155 expression following incubation of PNA conjugates (0.5
μM) in U87MG cells for 24 h at 37 °C. miR-155 is shown
in comparison to scrambled PNA controls. **P value
< 0.01.

In comparison to scrambled controls,
both PNA conjugates were shown
to sequester miR-155, with the C9–PNA conjugate
showing over 80% decrease in miR-155 in comparison to the scrambled
control.

Next, we examined cell viability by the XTT assay after
treating
U87MG cells with 1 μM of PNA conjugates (Figure 2). U87MG cells were incubated with PNA conjugates
for 72 h at 37 °C in triplicates in 96-well plates. As shown
in Figure 2a, over
an 80% reduction in cell viability was observed for cells treated
with C9–PNA in comparison to the C9–PNA-Scr
control. Both C9–PNA and C9–PNA-Scr
had negligible effects on the viability of THESCs uterus (immortalized
fibroblast) cells (Figure 2b) as well as on normal uterus human fibroblast cells produced
from a patient (Nf08 uterus, Figure S9).

the XTT assay. (a) U87GM cells were treated with 1 μM PNA conjugates
for 72 h at 37 °C (in triplicates in 96-well plates). Viability
is shown in comparison to scrambled PNA controls. *P value < 0.05, ***P value < 0.001. (b) THSCs
cells were treated with 1 μM PNA conjugates for 72 h at 37 °C
(in triplicates in 96-well plates). Viability is shown in comparison
to scrambled PNA controls. *P value < 0.05.

To examine the effect on cell survival and proliferation,
we seeded
U87MG glioblastoma cells in six-well plates, in the presence of either
dK4–PNA and C9–PNA or the scrambled
control PNAs (1.0 μM) for 24 h. After 2 weeks, the cell colonies
were counted (Figure 3). The graph represents colony numbers in the triplicate plates.
A substantial decrease in colony formation was observed for C9–PNA providing further support for the anticancer activity
exerted by C9–PNA in comparison with dK4–PNA and the scrambled controls.

cells. Colony formation assay of cells treated with 1.0 μM of

After 2 weeks, the plates were fixed and stained, and the colonies
were counted (in triplicates). *P value < 0.05.

To explore the cellular uptake and distribution,
both FITC-labeled
PNAs (C9–PNA–FITC and dK4–PNA–FITC)
were incubated (0.5 μM PNA for 3 h) with U87MG cells. Live cell
images of both PNAs are shown in Figure 4A. Clearly, C9–PNA–FITC
shows a dominant fluorescence in the cytoplasm which is significantly
higher than that of dK4–PNA–FITC. Some punctate
green fluorescence is also observed for C9–PNA–FITC;
these foci are inside cells, as verified by the cross-sectional confocal
images (Supporting Information, Figure
S7). To further quantify the PNA–FITC uptake into U87MG cells,
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis for both PNAs
was performed after a 2 h incubation period at the same PNA concentration
(0.5 μM). A clear and dominant change in FITC fluorescence is
seen for C9–PNA–FITC (Figure 4B), whereas almost no change in fluorescence
is seen for dK4–PNA–FITC. These results coincide
with the confocal images presented in Figure 4A.

Figure 4 C9–PNA–FITC shows efficient
cellular uptake
into U87MG cells. (A) Confocal images of C9–PNA–FITC
and dK4–PNA–FITC (at 0.5 μM) after

(at 0.5 μM) cellular uptake into U87MG cells after 2 h of incubation

The cyclic peptide used in this
study was reported by Qian and
co-workers11 to enter cells via an energy-dependent
endosomal mechanism. It is not clear, a priori, whether or not the
introduction of the PNA sequence affects the uptake mechanism of this
cyclic peptide. To answer this question, a series of flow cytometry
experiments were performed. U87MG cells were incubated for 2 h with
0.5 μM C9–PNA–FITC in the presence
of either 10 mM NaN3/10 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose at
37 °C or at 4 °C. Both conditions deplete ATP that is required
for endocytosis.11 As shown in Figure 5, in both conditions,
a clear decrease in cellular uptake was observed. These results suggest
that the cyclic peptide retains its energy-dependent cellular uptake
mechanism even after PNA conjugation.

uptake is energy-dependent.

incubation (A) at 4 °C or (B) at 37 °C with 10 mM NaN3/10 mM 2-deoxy-d-glucose.

To further elaborate on the cellular uptake into U87MG cells, we
stained the cells with Lyso-Tracker Red (staining lysosomes) and Hoechst
(staining nuclei), following a 3 h incubation with C9-PNA–FITC
or dK4–PNA–FITC, to follow the cellular localization
of FITC-labeled PNAs. As shown in Figure 6, there was a negligible uptake of dK4–PNA–FITC. In contrast, we observed strong punctate
green signals of C9–PNA–FITC that are predominantly
found in lysosomes and, to a lesser extent, in nuclei.

Figure 6 C9–PNA–FITC
cellular uptake is predominantly
in the cytoplasm. Confocal microscopy images of U87MG glioblastoma
cells incubated with C9–PNA–FITC or dK4–PNA–FITC (at 0.5 μM) after an incubation

lysosome (C); overlay of PNA–FITC (green) with Hoechst (blue)
staining of nuclei; and (D) overlay of both stains with PNA–FITC.

The cross-sectional confocal images (Supporting Information, Figure S8) further confirm the presence of C9–PNA–FITC inside cells. These results further
support the endocytosis-dependent mechanism of uptake for C9–PNA–FITC.

In this study, we have shown efficient
blocking of miR-155 by C9–PNA conjugates. We designed
and synthesized the C9 peptide from a solid support followed
by PNA–antimiR-155.
C9–PNA shows effective cellular uptake in comparison
to the dK4–PNA conjugate, which results in higher
bioavailability of PNA–antimiR-155 in the cytoplasm. Indeed,
a higher effect was achieved on sequestering miR-155 as well as in
inhibiting cell proliferation by C9–PNA in comparison
to dK4–PNA.

We have shown that the cyclic
peptide retains its energy-dependent
cellular uptake mechanism even after PNA conjugation. Using this synthetic
strategy, one may covalently link the C9 peptide to any
PNA sequence, thus providing the PNA–peptide conjugate with
high stability and cellular uptake.

Experimental Procedure
Materials
Fmoc-PNA monomers were purchased from PolyOrg,
Inc. (USA) and used as received. Amino acids (Fmoc-Lys-(BOC) (K),
Fmoc-Lys(MTT)OH (K), Fmoc-d-Arg(pbf)-OH (r), Fmoc-Arg(pbf)-OH
(R), Fmoc-l-2-naphthylalanine (ϕ), Fmoc-d-phenylalanine
(f), Fmoc-phenylalanine (F)), and N-9-fluoromethoxycarbonyl chloride
were purchased from GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. N-Fmoc-l-glutamic
acid 1-allyl ester, 98%, was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Ahx was purchased
from Acros Organics. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) was purchased from
Strem Chemicals. Phenylsilane was purchased from Merck. FITC was purchased
from Chem-Impex Int’l Inc. Solvents and reagents for peptide
chemistry were purchased from Bio-lab (Israel).

Solid-Phase
Synthesis of Linear PNA–Peptide Conjugates
PNAs (as
anitimiR-155 and scrambled sequence) with a short dK4 peptide
were synthesized on the solid phase (as full constructs
of peptide and PNA, with/without FITC) in a continuous manner.5 NovaSynTGA resin (Merck, Germany, 0.25 mmol/g)
was used as the solid support material, and PNA cleavage leads to
the free carboxylic acid at the C-terminus. For FITC labeling, Fmoc-Ahx
was introduced on the N-terminus of the PNA, followed by Fmoc deprotection
and addition of 20 μmol FITC and 40 μmol DIEA in 0.2 mL
dimethylformamide (DMF) for 48 h (×2). The addition of a linker,
Fmoc-Ahx-OH, between the PNA and FITC prevents its binding to the
α-NH position, thereby avoiding its elimination during sequence
cleavage.16

C9–PNA
Conjugate Synthesis and FITC Labeling
The linear version
of the C9 peptide was synthesized
as described above (linear form). After the addition of the last amino
acid (Phe, F), the allyl group of (Glu, E) on the C-terminal was removed
by the treatment of the resin-bound peptide with Pd(PPh3)4 and phenylsilane (0.1 and 24 equiv, respectively) in
0.02 M anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) (2 × 20 min). The N-terminal
Fmoc group (Phe, F) was then removed by treatment with 20% piperidine
in DMF, and the peptide was cyclized on the solid support by treatment
with HATU (6 equiv), HOBT (6 equiv), and DIPEA (10 equiv) in 0.15
M DMF for 3 h. To allow the introduction of the PNA sequence to the
cyclic peptide on the solid support, the first amino acid on the C-terminus
(N-α-Fmoc-N-ε-trityl-l-lysine) was used as a
handle (Scheme 1).
After the on-resin cyclization of the peptide, the trityl group was
selectively deprotected using 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
in dry DCM, followed by the addition of Fmoc-PNA-monomers as previously
described.5

Cleavage of PNAs from Resin
The antimiR-155 peptide–PNA
conjugates and antimiR-155 PNA labeled with FITC were deprotected
and released from the resin (as a free acid on C-terminus) by treatment
with 90:10 (v/v) TFA/m-cresol for the dK4–PNAs and
with 82:5:5:5:5:2.5 (v/v) TFA/thioanisole/water/phenol/ethanedithiol
for C9–PNAs for 3 h. The PNA conjugates were triturated
with cold ethyl ether, and the precipitate was collected. The PNA
samples were analyzed on RP-HPLC (Shimadzu LC2010), using a semipreparative
C18 reverse-phase column (Phenomenex, Jupiter 300 Å) at a flow
rate of 4 mL/min. Mobile phase: 0.1% TFA in H2O (A) and
acetonitrile (B) (see Supporting Information, Figures S1 and S5). The authenticity of each peptide–PNA
conjugate was confirmed by using a ThermoQuest Finnigan LCQ-Duo ESI
mass spectrometer (Table 1, and Supporting Information Figures
S2, S3, and S6). The final solutions were measured at 260 nm and calculated
based on the extinction coefficients of the nucleobases.

Cell Culture
All cell lines (U87MG, Nf08 uterus, and
THESCs uterus) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS),
penicillin, and streptomycin.

miR-155 Reverse Transcription
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total microRNA was isolated from
cells using the mirPremier microRNA
Isolation Kit from Sigma, and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg
RNA using the qScript microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit in a final volume
of 20 μL according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Quantabio). Real-time PCR was performed on a real time-PCR Connect
ST System BioRad, and PCR parameters were adjusted as recommended
by the manufacturer (PerfeCTa SYBR Green SuperMix, Quantabio). Primers
for miR-155 were purchased from Hylabs (See Supporting Information, Table S1)

Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells [U87MG glioblastoma
cells, THESCs uterus cells, and Nf08 uterus cells (3 × 103)] were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h for
cell attachment. Next, dK4–PNA (and its scrambled
control) and C9–PNA (and its scrambled control)
were added after medium replacement and incubated (37 °C, humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2) for 72 h. Cell proliferation
was then measured using the XTT (sodium 3-[1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)
benzene sulfonic acid hydrate)] proliferation assay, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Biological Industries, Israel).

Clonogenic Assay
After 24 h of transfection, 1000 and
500 U87MG cells were seeded in triplicates in six-well plates with
2 mL of medium (DMEM, 10% FCS). After 14 days, the cells were fixed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 10 min, stained with 1% methylene
blue solution, and counted.

Live Cell Imaging
Twelve hours prior
to FITC-labeled
PNA conjugate addition, U87MG cells were plated on an eight-well chamber
removable microscope-sterilized glass slide (NBT New Bio Technology
Ltd.). The cells were grown until reaching 70–80% confluence.
Before adding the PNAs, the medium was replaced and the cells were
incubated (37 °C, humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2) with 0.5 μM of dK4–PNA–FITC
or C9–PNA–FITC in complete medium, over a
period of 3 h, followed by two washings with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). For negative control, untreated cells were used. Cell fluorescence
analysis was performed using a confocal laser scanning microscope,
Olympus FV300.

Cell Staining for Colocalization Studies
The initial
procedure was carried out as described for live cell imaging. For
lysosome staining, a solution of 50 nM Lyso-Tracker Red (LysoTracker
Red DND-99 1 mM Eugene, Oregon USA) was prepared in a cell culture
medium and was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for
20–30 min. To achieve nuclear staining, the cells were washed
twice with PBS and incubated with 0.01 mM Hoechst (bis-benzimide H
33342 trihydrochloride, Merck) at 37 °C for 15 min. Thereafter,
the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (Biolab, Israel) and washed
three times with PBS prior to imaging. Cell fluorescence analysis
was performed using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning system
(Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging GmbH, Jena, Germany).

FACS Analysis
of FITC-Labeled PNA Conjugates
Flow cytometry
studies were performed by plating 2.0 × 105 U87MG
cells/well prepared in six-well plates, and the cells were allowed
to adhere overnight under normal culture conditions. The medium (DMEM,
10% FCS) was replaced and the cells were incubated (37 °C, humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2) with 0.5 μM of dK4–PNA–FITC or with C9–PNA–FITC
in a complete medium, over 2 h. The medium with the PNA conjugate
was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Then, the cells were
detached from the wells with 400 μL of 0.25% trypsin–
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution for 5 min at room temperature.
The cells were collected into 1.5 mL polypropylene vials and then
sedimented for 5 min at 4.186g at room temperature.
The supernatant was discarded. The samples were resuspended with 800
μL cold PBS, filtered by Falcon cell strainers, 70 μm
nylon, and analyzed by a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX flow cytometer (488
nm excitation laser), with gating based on normalized fluorescence
of untreated cells to evaluate the percentage of cells which internalized
the fluorescently labeled PNA conjugates. To assess the endocytosis-dependent
uptake of C9–PNA–FITC, the cells were pretreated
with endocytosis inhibitors. U87MG cells were treated with C9–PNA–FITC (0.5 μM) for 2 h at 37 °C in the
presence of 10 mM NaN3 and 2-deoxy-d-glucose or
at 4 °C prior to flow cytometry analysis. Control cells were
incubated with C9–PNA–FITC (0.5 μM)
without the addition of endocytosis inhibitors or incubation at low
temperature (4 °C). The cell treatment and uptake mechanism were
followed by FACS analysis as mentioned above, using two repeats for
each experimental condition.
