By
means of computer modeling, the self-organization of densely
grafted macromolecules with amphiphilic monomer units as a function
of macromolecular polymerization degree and solvent quality was studied
and a diagram of state was constructed. The diagram contains fields
of disordered distribution of monomer units and of prolonged aggregates,
regions of lamellae with small and big domain spacing, and transition
region. Within the transition region, the lamellae with different
spacing coexist: the lamellae with big domain spacing are on the top
of the grafting layer and the lamellae with small domain spacing are
close to the grafting surface. The lamellae are connected with each
other and form bicontinuous parking garage structure joining all side
groups into a single cluster. The domain spacing of lamellae does
not depend on the macromolecular length, but the width of the transition
region decreases with the decrease of polymerization degree until
total vanishing at relatively short macromolecules. The sharp switch
between lamellae and bicontinuous structure opens the perspective
for practical applications of densely grafted layers with amphiphilic
monomer units.

Introduction
The brush surfaces, decorated by responsive
macromolecules, could
change their properties on demand of external stimuli, and thereby
they are able to control adhesion and wetting, to operate as sensors,
to form a coating with changeable pattern, and so forth.1−3 Responsive brush surfaces occur in nature.3−5

The self-assembly
of grafted macromolecules is a complex process
sensitive to many factors, among which are grafting density and solvent
quality, architecture and chemical composition of macromolecules,
availability of groups with different affinity to solvent and their
relative content, interaction with substrate, and so forth.6−8

In a good solvent with the increase of grafting density, the
macromolecules
undergo a smooth transition from coil to almost a fully stretched
state.9,10 The macromolecules start to stretch perpendicular
to the grafting surface when the distance d between
grafting points becomes comparable with macromolecular radius of gyration, Rg. It is accepted that the grafting layer is
in the so-called mushroom regime when the parameter of reduced grafting
density  is less than
unity: Σ < 1; in
brush regime at Σ > 5; and in the intermediate regime when
1
< Σ < 5.11 The macromolecular
size Rg and grafting density for mushroom–brush
transition depend on the solvent quality. Also, in a poor solvent,
the increase of grafting density causes a sequence of transformations:
single globule—compacted micelles of few polymer chains—fused
micelles or stripes—reverse micelles—homogeneous layer.12−16 The homogeneous layers are literally uniform. However, different
macromolecules are unequally stretched perpendicular to the substrate,
and their free ends can be distributed over the whole layer.17 Such a distribution significantly increases
the cumulative conformational entropy of grafted macromolecules and
thus decreases the total elastic force acting on all grafted polymer
chains.17−19

Diblock copolymers could repeat the above-described
sequencing
of morphological transformation with the growth of grafting density
in case of strongly incompatible blocks and solvent being selectively
poor for internal, grafted to the substrate, blocks.20−28 In other cases (relative compatibility of blocks, strong hydrophilicity
or explicit hydrophobicity of external blocks, and so forth), much
more complex structures are observed. There could be micelles with
one or few hydrophobic cores covered by hydrophilic monomers, structured
stripes, and domains oriented perpendicular to the substrate.20−28 The latter structures are formed in nonselective solvents by external
blocks bent inward. Depending on their relative lengths, the external
blocks can join into semispherical, cylindrical, or layered domains.
These domains are deepened to the matrix of internal blocks and have
no contacts with the substrate. To stress this fact, ref (28) proposes to call them
“golf holes”, “stalactites”, and “ridges
and gullies”, correspondingly.

Grafted layers of amphiphilic
homopolymers consisting the identical
and amphiphilic monomers including both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
groups were addressed in refs.29−31 The presence of groups having an affinity to different solvents
implies surface activity of such monomer units32,33 accounted for by the dumbbell model of monomer units.34 This model represents an amphiphilic monomer
unit as two A and B beads linked with each other by covalent bonds.
Some beads, for example, A, form a backbone and other beads, B, are
pendants.34 It was shown that such a model
allows to describe the unique conformations adopted by macromolecules
with amphiphilic monomer units in dilute and concentrated solutions,34−39 to reconstruct their specific ordering in the bulk40,41 and near interface.42−44 In selective solvent, amphiphilic homopolymers sparsely
grafted onto a flat substrate can form an ultrathin coating having
the width of about two monomer units.29 Domains oriented perpendicularly to the substrate are observed in
densely grafted amphiphilic homopolymers.30,31 Depending on the solvent selectivity, they can be strands of few
macromolecules,30,31 lamellae with different periods,
and parking garage structures,31 joining
lamellae with different periods by screw ramps.

This article
addresses the influence of macromolecular length on
the structure formed in densely grafted layers of macromolecules with
amphiphilic monomer units.

Simulation Model
The studied polymer
brush is depicted in Figure 1. It comprises n identical
macromolecules, each consisting of N amphiphilic
monomer units. The amphiphilic monomer is represented as an A-graft-B dumbbell of two A and B beads linked together by
a covalent bond. A beads form the polymer backbone, and B beads are
side pendants. The macromolecules are tethered to the solid substrate
through the fixation of A beads of the first monomer of each macromolecule
in sites of square lattice with side d. The polymer
brush is placed into the selective solvent being athermal for backbone
A groups and poor for side B groups.

Figure 1 Schematic presentation of studied amphiphilic
homopolymer brush.

The calculations are
performed at a coarse-grained level using
the molecular dynamic technique with the LAMMPS software package45 and resources of the Supercomputing Center of
Lomonosov Moscow State University.46

The excluded volume of beads is accounted for by the shifted and
truncated repulsive branch of the 12–6 Lennard-Jones (Weeks–Chandler–Andersen)
potential, Ev 1  where r is the distance between
two particles; σ refers to the bead diameter; and ε defines
the strength of the interaction in units of temperature kBT (kB is
the Boltzmann’s constant). We take the diameter σ ≡
1 as the unit of length, the energy ε ≡ 1 as the unit
of energy, and subsequent results are presented in terms of these
natural units.

The bonded beads interact via finitely extensible
nonlinear elastic
(FENE) potential, EFENE, acting between
the beads adjacent along the backbone and between two beads forming
A-graft-B monomer unit 2  where K = 30 is the spring
constant, and bmax = 1.5 is the maximum
bond length. An equilibrium bond length b determined
by the interplay of elastic (2) and excluded volume (1) interactions
with the selected K and bmax values is a little less than unity: b = 0.97.

The nonbonded monomer units interact via Yukawa-type potential, EIJ(r), accounting implicitly
the solvent quality 3  where k = 1.2 is the inverse
screening length, and characteristic energies εIJ are different for different groups (I, J = A, B).

In a simulation
presented here, εAA = 0, εAB >
0, and εBB ≤ 0. There are no any,
except excluded volume, interactions between backbone A groups, and
the solvent is selectively good for them. The positive parameter εAB promotes segregation of A and B groups and ensures the surface
activity of amphiphilic A-graft-B monomer units.
The negative parameter εBB provides attractive interaction
between side B groups and reproduces poor solvent conditions for monomer
pendants: −10 < εBB < 0.

The substrate
is modeled as a flat wall located at z = 0 and interacting
with each bead via truncated repulsive branch
of the 9–3 Lennard-Jones potential, Es(47) 4  where z is a distance
normal
to the surface.

As usual, temperature T was
maintained by a Langevin
thermostat with a friction term and a Langevin uncorrelated noise
term Ri related to the
viscosity of the solvent through the fluctuation–dissipation
theorem48 5  where δ is the Dirac delta function;
α = x, y, and z are the coordinates, i = 1, ..., nN; and parameter Γ = 0.01 in all calculations.

In each
computer experiment, the polymer brush contains n = 169 macromolecules and the distance between grafting
points d = 2. The degree of polymerization N changes from N = 10 to N = 100 monomer units. Thus, the reduced grafting density  varies
from Σ ≈ 8.2 to Σ
≈ 82, where RG0 is the gyration
radius of macromolecule in the melt. Our calculations show that although
the backbone A–A bonds experience excessive tension, even at
the highest grafting density, the average bond length was not more
than 1% longer than its equilibrium value: b = 0.97.

In the initial configuration, the polymer chains were extended
in the direction of the z-axis; then, the polymer
brush was equilibrated for a long time with εAA =
0, εAB = 0, and εBB = 0. After that,
the energy εBB was gradually increased to εBB = −10 in steps of ΔεBB = −0.25.
For each value of εBB, simulations were performed
during prolonged time with the integration step of 0.01τ ( is the unit of time) to ensure system equilibration.
After that, the production stage was committed. The relaxation and
production times were fitted to ensure a complete system equilibration
and a rational result justification, which were checked by standard
procedures.31 The full calculation time
varied from 10 000τ to 60 000τ steps depending
on the macromolecular length and interaction energy εBB.

The results of the calculations are discussed in the next
section.

Results
Typical structures distinguished in computer
experiments are shown
in Figure 2. There
are totally mixed state with a homogeneous distribution of A and B
groups (A), prolonged aggregates (B and C), and lamellae with different
domain spacing (D–F).

As it was shown recently,31 the segregation
of A and B groups is accompanied by limitation of possible directions
of bond vectors r⃗AB connecting
A and B groups of the monomer unit. Numerically, this effect could
be accounted for by calculations of circular distribution  of bond vectors r⃗AB(i) over orientation
angle Ωi which was determined, for
definiteness,
as an angle between the bond projection Prxy[r⃗AB(i)] on the grafting plane XY and the axis oX: Ωi = arctan(yAB(i)/xAB(i)), where i = 1, ..., nN. The distribution  averaged over time for different energies
εBB, and polymerization degrees N are shown in Figure 3. The distributions are presented in polar coordinates  with angle Ω changing in the interval
0 ≤ Ω ≤ 360° and radius  showing the
fraction of A–B bond
vectors with given angle .

Figure 3 Distribution  of bond vectors r⃗AB over angle Ω
for different energies
εBB. N = 75 (left) and N = 15 (right). Dashed red lines indicate main directions of bond
vectors at high values of |εBB|.

It is seen that at low values of |εBB|,
the distribution  is an almost perfect circle with the center
at the origin point and negligible fluctuations in radius . Growth of
B–B attractive interaction
|εBB| leads to visible deformation of : fraction  increases
for some angles Ω and simultaneously
decreases for others. In case of N = 75, at εBB > −4, the distribution  looks similar to a flattened
oval. Within interval −8 < εBB < −4, the
long axis of this oval is placed parallel to oX axis.  has a maxima at Ω
≈ 0°
and 180° and minima at Ω ≈ 90° and 270°.
The  oval becomes thinner
with the increase
of |εBB|, and also at εBB = −8,
it changes orientation: the long axis rotates by about 14°.  rotation indicates the
rotation of lamellae
and also implies the changes of periodic structures. Lamellae of shorter
macromolecules (N = 15) are arranged first parallel
to oX: the bond vectors are mostly perpendicular
to oX. Then, they turn by about 14° as well.
We would like to mention that the size of the cell was chosen as a
commensurate size of lamellae with a small domain spacing. It contains
an integer number of domain spacings of such lamellae and ensures
their spontaneous arrangement parallel to cell sides.49

The circular distribution  is characterized by dispersion
σΩ calculated
as50 6  

The dispersion
σΩ allows estimating quantitatively
the range of available bond vectors r⃗AB orientations. In case of a totally free orientation
of A–B bonds, the dispersion σΩ is maximal
and equals unity: σΩ = 1. Any limitation on
the position of A–B bonds leads to σΩ decrease.

The dependences σΩ(εBB)
for different N are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Dispersion σΩ as a function
of εBB for different polymerization degree N.
Dashed vertical lines indicate critical points of transition from
ordered to disordered state for N = 100.

In the absence of energetic interactions between
B groups (εBB ≈ 0) and at a relatively weak
B–B attraction,
the dispersion σΩ is close to unity. It reflects
that in this field, the bond vector r⃗AB could accept any directions. The dispersion σΩ decreases with the increase of |εBB|. First, it drops sharply; after that, it smoothly goes to plateau.
The amplitude of the drop as well as its position depend on the macromolecular
length N. For macromolecules with N = 100, the sharp drop of dispersion σΩ from
σΩ ≈ π to σΩ ≈ 0.69π proceeds within the interval ΔεBB ≈ −1.5 ÷ −2.5. For macromolecules
with N = 25, the interval of sharp drop shifts toward
larger |εBB|: ΔεBB ≈
−3.0 ÷ −4.0; within this interval, the dispersion
σΩ changes from σΩ ≈
1 to σΩ ≈ 0.6. Inflection points of
σΩ(εBB) dependence can be
referred to as critical values ε1cr of transition from disordered to ordered
state with prolonged aggregates. It is seen that the longer is macromolecular
length N, the smaller is |ε1cr|.

Figure 5 shows the
structure factor S(q⃗) calculated according to the procedure of ref (49)  where r⃗ij is the vector between groups (i, j = 1, ..., 2nN); ei is −1 for A groups
and +1 for B groups.

Figure 5 Structure factor S(q) as a function
of wave vector q for different energy εBB at N = 10 (A); 20 (B); and 50 (C).

Defined in that way, the structure
factor S(q⃗) allows detecting the lamellar
ordering and determining their domain spacing as: λ = 1/q*, where q* is the wave vector of the
maximum of the structure factor.

It is seen in Figure 5 that the structure factor S(q⃗) can have
pronounced maximum at two different values q1* ≈ 0.195
and q2* ≈ 0.23 indicating the existence
of two types of lamellar structures with big λ1 ≈
5 and small λ2 ≈ 4.35 domain spacing. The
lamellae with small domain spacing are observed at the weaker εBB attraction. The availability and height of the maxima depend
on the energy εBB and polymerization degree N.

In case of macromolecules with N = 10, the structure
factor S(q) has the only maximum
at q ≈ 0.235. This maximum appears at |εBB| ≈ 5.5 and demonstrates steady growth with the increase
of |εBB|. For N = 20, one can distinguish
three characteristic regions. At |εBB| ≤ 4,
the structure factor S(q) has no
extreme point; within interval 4 ≤ |εBB| ≤
7.5, the structure factor S(q) has
a well-pronounced maximum at q2* ≈ 0.23. At |εBB| ≥ 7.75, the structure factor S(q) also has the only maximum located at a lower wave vector: q1* ≈ 0.195 (see Figure 5B and insert). Thus, within interval 7.5 <|εBB| < 7.75, the period of lamellae structure increases from
λ2 ≈ 4.35 to λ1 ≈
5. In case of longer macromolecules (N = 50), the
transformation of lamellae proceeds within a much wider interval from
|εBB| = 6.5 to |εBB| = 7.75. Within
this interval, the structure factor has a broad maximum covering both q1* and q2* area and indicating the coexistence of lamellae with different
domain spacing. Also, here the maximum value of the structure factor
is much lower. Thus, the analysis of structure factors allows us to
distinguish the field of lamellae with small spacing (the only distinct
maximum at q2*), the field of lamellae with big period (the
only distinct maximum at q1*) and the transition region. For a given
degree of polymerization N, the field of lamellae
with a small period is limited by an energy interval εs–bcr <
εBB < εscr, where plot S(q) demonstrates the only maximum at the big wave vector. The boundary
εbcr of
lamellae with a big domain spacing field is determined as the maximum
value of energy εBB having a structure factor with
the only maximum at the small wave vector. The interval from εs–bcr to εbcr is the transition
region which includes both lamellae structures joined with each other
to single structure referred as the parking garage structure.31

The results are summarized as a diagram
of states in Figure 6. There, regions without segregation
of A and B groups and with aggregates from few macromolecules, fields
of lamellae with small and big domain spacing, and parking garage
region are shown. The boundaries between different regions are calculated
according to the procedures described above.

One can see that longer macromolecules undergo disorder-aggregates
transition at the lower attraction between side groups. Curve, indicating
the boundary between aggregates and region of lamellae with small
domain spacing, is increasing function of N only
at small polymerization degree (N < 20); then,
it goes to plateau and remain constant. Another curve, limiting the
region of lamellae with small domain spacing at high values of |εBB| also is parallel to N axis at N > 25. At smaller N (N < 25), it drops sharply. Our calculations show that macromolecules
with N < 15 keep small domain spacing even at
extremely high attraction εBB. Longer macromolecules
join to lamellae with a small domain spacing at relatively small B–B
attractive interaction (Figure 7, εBB = −6.25) and form lamellae with
a big period at high attraction (Figure 7, εBB = −8). Boundary
of the region of lamellae with a big domain spacing is shown by green.
The shaded spacing between red and green curves is the transition
region. It is extremely narrow for short macromolecules and broadens
with the increase of polymerization degree N. In
this transition region, the lamellae with different periods are piled
one over the other (Figure 7, εBB: = −6.75 and −7): lamellae
with big domain spacing are in the top of the brush and lamellae with
small domain spacing are close to the grafting surface. In fact, they
form a system of parallel layers mutually connected by bridges which
are similar to the ramps in the multistorey parking garage31 (first, the term “parking garage structure”
was employed to name a similar ordering in the endoplasmic reticulum
with stacked membrane sheets and twisted membrane connection51).

Figure 7 Instant snapshots taken from different angles
Ω at different
energies εBB. N = 50. Only side
B groups are shown.

The formation of a parking
garage structure embarks as the appearance
of a thin layer of the lamellae with big domain spacing on the top
of the brush (Figure 7). This layer is turned with respect to the bottom lamellae on an
angle of 14°. To make it clear, we present instant snapshots
in the front projection (Ω = 0) and in projection rotated by
Ω = 14°. One can see that the bottom layer contains six
lamellae which are parallel to the oX. Upper layer
includes five lamellae. With the increase of |εBB|, this layer becomes thicker, it shifts closer to the grafting surface,
and finally spreads to the whole grafting layer.

Short macromolecules
(N < 25) pass through
the parking garage structure within an extremely narrow interval of
εBB. Long macromolecules with N =
100 persist parking garage structure even at a rather strong attractive
interactions: εBB < −10.

Figure 8 Fraction ⟨M⟩ of B groups at the
biggest aggregate as a function of εBB. N = 50.

To reveal bicontinuous properties
of the parking garage structure,
the fraction ⟨M⟩ of B groups belonging
to the largest aggregate was calculated. Aggregate is defined as a
set of B groups, each within the distance rag = 1.3 from one or more other groups in the cluster. By definition,
⟨M⟩ changes within the interval 0 <
⟨M⟩ ≤ 1 and reaches its maximum
value when all B groups are joined into a single cluster. It is seen
(Figure 8) that ⟨M⟩ is a complex function of εBB.
First, it monotonously increases up to ⟨M⟩
≈ 0.7, then drops to ⟨M⟩ ≈
0.3, abruptly goes to ⟨M⟩ ≈
1, and finally undergoes a sharp transition to ⟨M⟩ ≈ 0.2. It is seen that sharp changes in ⟨M⟩ are the consequence of structure reconstruction.
The boundaries of structure are shown by a dashed line colored in
accordance with the state diagram in Figure 6. Aggregation number ⟨M⟩ reaches its largest possible value in the region of the
parking garage structure where ⟨M⟩
= 1. In that way, we numerically confirm the bicontinuous character
of parking structure with all B groups joined in the single cluster.

Figure 9 Backbone
tension ΥAA as a function of bond index l for N = 50 and different energies εBB.

The significant stretching of
macromolecules caused by their dense
grafting leads to substantial backbone tension ΥAA.52,53 Backbone tension ΥAA(l) of the l bond (l =
1, ..., N – 1) is a total force acting between l and l + 1 monomer units and determined
by excluded volume (1) and FENE (2) potentials. The backbone tension
ΥAA(l), averaged over chains and
time, is shown in Figure 9 for different εBB.

It is seen that
one could distinguish two characteristic scenarios
of ΥAA(l) dependencies. In the absence
of attractive interaction and for relatively weak attraction (−4
≤ εBB ≤ 0), the backbone tension ΥAA(l) is high. It is almost constant for the
initial, closest to the grafting surface, part of macromolecules,
and sharply declines with the increase of l for the
ending part of the chain. It is seen here that the tension of starting
part of macromolecules decreases with the increase of B–B attraction
(the increase of absolute value |εBB|), and that
even bonds in the external part (l = 47 and 48) are
exposed to significant tension. In contrast, at stronger attractive
interaction εBB ≤ −6, the backbone
tension ΥAA(l) sharply decreases
at the initial part of the chain, and then it stays as a constant.
Here also, the backbone tension ΥAA(l) decreases with |εBB| growth. At εBB ≈ −10, the backbone tension ΥAA takes
zero and negative values.

It means that in this case, the A–A
bonds could be stretched
(ΥAA > 0), shrunken (ΥAA <
0),
or have precisely an equilibrium length (ΥAA = 0).
It is seen that in fact only the initial part (l <
15) is stretched (ΥAA > 0), and the tension in
the
ending part (l > 15) fluctuates around zero. Our
calculations reveal that even at the highest overall tension (εBB = 0), the average bond length expands by less than 1% from
its equilibrium value: b = 0.97. In case εBB ≈ −10, fluctuations in the length of bond
with index l > 15 are about 0.05%, and one can
conclude
that at εBB = −10, the bonds of ending part
of macromolecules are close to their basic states with b = 0.97. Thus, the self-organization in densely grafted layers relieves
the bond tension and diminishes the corresponding energy.

Conclusions
By means of computer modeling, we study the self-organization of
macromolecules densely grafted to plane (polymer brushes) with surface-active
monomers and different polymerization degree. The surface activity
of monomers was accounted for by representing them as an A-graft-B “dumbbells” of two beads. A and B
beads repel each other and selectively interact with the solvent.
The solvent being athermal for backbone A groups and poor for pendant
B, graduate worsening of the solvent quality, modeled by the increase
of attractive B–B energy εBB, leads to aggregation
of B groups and transformation of polymer brushes from the state with
homogeneous A and B distribution to prolonged aggregates and lamellae
structures. The plane of the lamellae is perpendicular to the grafting
surface. The lamellae could have two different domain spacing: smaller
in a less poor solvent and bigger in a more poor solvent. The domain
spacings of both lamellae structures, if they arise, do not depend
on the polymerization degree. In the transition region, these lamellae
coexist but reside at different heights. Lamellae with small domain
spacing are closer to the grafting surface and lamellae with large
domain spacing are on the top. They are turned with respect to each
other and are connected by twisted bridges to form the parking garage
structure. The results are presented as a state diagram with five
different regions: disorder, aggregates, lamellae with small domains
spacing, transition region, and lamellae with big domain spacing.
The boundaries were determined qualitatively through the calculations
of the structure factor function, the circular distribution of A–B
bond vectors, and its dispersion.

The boundary between disorder
region and aggregates is monotonically
an increasing function of polymerization degree: the longer are the
macromolecules, the poorer is the solvent quality of aggregate formation.
The position of the border between the region of aggregates and the
region of lamellae with a small period does not depend on the polymerization
degree for a sufficiently long chain (N > 25)
and
shifts toward poor solvent quality with the decrease of chain length N for shorter chains (N < 25). The width
of the transition region between lamellae with different spacing depends
on the polymerization degree: it is the widest for long macromolecules,
narrows down with the decrease of macromolecular length, and totally
disappears for relatively short macromolecules (N < 15). The reduced density of macromolecules was quite high (from
8.2 to 82), and macromolecules are stretched perpendicular to the
grafting surface. This stretching is a result of excluded volume interaction
with neighbor chains and induces sufficient backbone tension which
is distributed over chains and depends on solvent quality. In the
absence or at the relatively weak B–B attraction (disordered
or aggregates regions in state diagram), the dependence of bond tension
on bond index looks similar to a step function: the bond tension is
constant which does not depend on the bond index for the whole chain
except short outer piece, where tension drops sharply. At strong B–B
attraction (lamellae and parking garage structure), the repulsive
excluded volume interactions are screened and bond tension as a whole
is smaller, and maximum tension is imposed on the bond next to grafting
surface. It can be explained by larger scale of emerging structures
that leads to stretching of the beginning pieces of chains, the so-called
legs. The stretching is balanced by energetic gains because of stronger
aggregation of B groups and formation of sufficient room for A–B
segregation. In short macromolecules, legs could comprise a significant
part of the chain, and the shorter the chain, the larger interaction
energy εBB is needed to counterbalance the stretching
of legs. In extremely short macromolecules, such balance is unreachable
at least for an investigated range of interaction energy εBB; thus, lamellae with a larger domain spacing do not appear
at all.

The formation of different structures is accompanied
by the change
of B–B aggregation number which exhibits sharp jump in the
region of “aggregates-lamellae” and “lamellae-parking
structure-lamellae” transitions. For the parking garage structure,
the aggregation number, measured as a fraction of monomer units entering
the biggest clusters, is close to unity. It is the maximum possible
value indicating the merge of all B groups to the only cluster and
the formation of the bicontinuous structure. The ability to pass rapidly
from bicontinuous to lamellae structure could be interesting for practical
applications which require a quick change of connectivity, such as
molecular switches, elements of electrical circuits, the system for
controllable catalysis, and so forth.54 We believe that such types of reconstruction (lamellae—parking
garage—lamellae) could be observed in other polymer systems,
where self-organization is accompanied by the conformation changes
of their constituent parts.
