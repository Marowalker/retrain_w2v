Mononuclear gold(I) acyclic diaminocarbenes
(ADCs) were prepared
by the reaction of 1,2-cyclohexanediamine with the corresponding isocyanide
complexes [AuCl(CNR)] (R = Cy, tBu). The
three-component coupling of aldehydes, amines, and alkynes was investigated
by using these gold(I) ADC complexes. The new gold(I) metal complexes
are highly efficient catalysts for the synthesis of propargylamines
and indolizines in the absence of solvent and in mild conditions.
This method affords the corresponding final products with excellent
yields in short reaction times. Additionally, chiral gold(I) complexes
with ADCs have been prepared and tried in the enantioselective synthesis
of propargylamines.

Introduction
The chemistry of gold
has attracted the interest of many research
groups because of the properties presented by its complexes covering
different areas of investigation, such as in medicine as anticancer
agents,1−10 in materials chemistry for their optical properties,11−13 or in catalysis because gold is able to promote several organic
transformations.14−23

In this field, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)24,25 are a kind of privileged scaffolds efficiently employed as ligands
in gold compounds with applications in catalysis,26,27 medicine,28,29 and optical materials.30 However, some of these NHCs still present some
drawbacks. Nowadays, acyclic diaminocarbenes (ADCs) have become a
promising alternative to NHCs for transition-metal-catalyzed organic
transformations.31 ADCs are free of some
disadvantages that are present in the NHCs, such as the difficulty
in their preparation when NHCs are unsymmetrically substituted or
chiral, or when NHCs are used as ligands with steric hindrance. Remarkably,
among them, gold(I) ADC complexes have received less attention in
comparison with their cyclic analogues. Therefore, the search for
new interesting examples is still an open challenging area of research.32,33

Multicomponent (MC) processes are of great interest because
of
their atom efficiency, affording structural diversity and complexity
in a single reaction step. Their development has attracted the attention
and efforts of many research groups over the years for obtaining numerous
compound libraries with combinatorial chemistry. Moreover, MC reactions
(MCRs) have played an important role in the progress for drug discovery.34,35 Among these processes, the formation of propargylamines via a three-component
coupling procedure, commonly called A3-coupling reaction,
is an interesting approach center of continuous investigations.36−40 Propargylamines are versatile building blocks for the synthesis
of nitrogen-containing molecules. The structural core of the resulting
amine derivatives is present in many natural products and drug candidates
(Figure 1).41−45 Some examples such as pargyline,46 rasagyline,47 and selegiline48 have
found applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases,
such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.49,50

factor.

Therefore, the development of
a new synthetic procedure to obtain
propargylamines is a very attractive aim because they are useful intermediates.
Interestingly, the use of gold-based catalysts in these A3-coupling procedures has been shortly explored.51−61

The synthesis of indolizines in a tandem reaction involving
an
MC approach is also an interesting active goal.62,63 Indolizines, one of the most important N-fused
heterocyclic skeletons, are found in a variety of biological active
compounds (Figure 1). Indolizines display a broad spectrum of potential pharmacological
activities and are used in a variety of applications for drug discovery.64

Gold-based catalysts have been scarcely
used for the preparation
of indolizines.65−70 It is worth mentioning that only one example where the authors carry
out a tandem multicomponent strategy has been described.67 Because of the scarce background found in the
literature for this process using gold catalysts along with the interesting
biological properties exhibited by indolizines, the search for novel
efficient and eco-friendly protocols using benign catalysts still
remains a challenging task.

With all these ideas in mind, we
planned the preparation of new
and challenging gold(I) ADC complexes. Moreover, the resulting carbenes
could be promising catalysts in different organic processes. Here,
we report on the synthesis of such ADC gold derivatives and the study
of their applications in the synthesis of propargylamines and indolizines
through MCRs.

Results and Discussion
The common
synthesis of metal acyclic carbenes is based on the
nucleophilic attack of an amine over a metal isocyanide complex. This
procedure does not proceed easily for all the amines, and in some
cases with aryl or less activated amines, the reaction does not work.71 (±)-1,2-Cyclohexanediamine (2a), as a racemic mixture of trans isomers, has been
employed by the first time for the preparation of gold ADCs 3a and 3b using isocyanides 1a and 1b following the reaction depicted in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of ADC Gold Carbene Complexes
Acyclic carbenes 3a and 3b were easily
prepared via the reaction of the isocyanide chloride gold(I) compound
and the racemic mixture of 1,2-cyclohexanediamine (2a) at room temperature, giving rise to very good yields in both cases.
It is remarkable that the mononuclear complexes are also obtained
even in the case where a 2:1 molar ratio is used. Probably, the high
insolubility of compounds 3a and 3b in dichloromethane
is a driving force to solely produce the mononuclear species. Complexes 3a and 3b are sparingly soluble in common organic
solvents. The 1H NMR spectrum of complex 3b carried out in methanol-d4 shows the
expected resonances for the cyclohexyl skeleton, with two multiplets
for the −CH– protons, four multiplets for the −CH2– protons, and a singlet for the tert-butyl protons. The amine protons are not observed as they interchange
with the deuterium of the solvent. In the 13C-attached
proton test (APT) NMR spectrum, all the signals can be easily assigned
(Figure S4) and corroborate the inequivalence
of all the carbons in the cyclohexyl moiety, thus indicating that
only one gold center has formed the ADC unit. The resonance due to
the carbene carbon atom appears at 192.0 ppm.

In contrast, in
complex 3a because of the higher steric
hindrance of the substituents and also because the carbene C–N
bond shows a considerable multiple character in this type of complexes,
an important restriction to rotation is produced, giving rise to stereoisomers
or rotamers (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Different structural conformations for ADCs.

For this reason, complex 3a shows a very complicated 1H NMR spectrum, and the resonances of the −CH2– protons at the cyclohexyl ring appear as multiplets. It
is possible to observe the resonances of the cyclohexyl −CH–
protons in the less congested area in three different rotamers, with
two of them in higher proportion. In the 13C-APT NMR spectrum,
two resonances with different intensities are observed for the carbene
carbon atoms, which are probably due to the two major rotamers. The
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra show the
cationic peak arising at the loss of the chlorine ligand for complex 3a at m/z = 420.1759 [M
– Cl]+ and both the molecular peak [M + H]+ at m/z = 430.1327 and the cationic
[M – Cl]+ at m/z = 394.1524 for complex 3b. Additionally, the analytical
data for these complexes also agree with the proposed formulation.
In the infrared (IR) spectra, the most significant absorptions are
the ν(Au–Cl), which appears at around 320 cm–1, and the ν(N–H) in the range 2600–3000 cm–1.

With both gold complexes in hand and in the
context of our research
program focused on the development of new catalytic processes, we
first centered our attention in the preparation of propargylamines 7 via the A3-coupling reaction following an easy
and straightforward procedure. To test the efficiency of our precatalytic
structures 3a,b, the viability of the reaction
model illustrated in Table 1 was initially explored.

AgNTf2 (0.0025 mmol), and solvent 0.7 mL.

b The conversions of the reactions
are given by 1H NMR using mesitylene as the internal standard.

c Without addition of AgNTf2.

In the first screening
of solvent at 60 °C, encouraging results
were found with MeOH-d4 for 1 mol % of
the catalyst (Table 1, entry 1) after short reactions times (5 h). In contrast, with CD3CN and toluene-d8, better conversions
were only achieved when the temperature of the reaction was increased
until 70 °C for the same reaction time (entries 3 and 5). Interestingly,
a complete conversion was observed when the reaction was performed
in the absence of solvent at 60 °C after 5 h of the reaction
(entry 6). It is worth noting that the gold precatalyst3a does not promote the reaction in the absence of
the Ag species (entry 7). The same is observed when the reaction was
performed only with the cocatalyst AgNTf2 (entry 8). A
good result was obtained using catalyst 3b (entry 9),
although a slight lower conversion was observed in comparison with
catalyst 3a. With the best reaction conditions found,
different aldehydes 4a–c, acetylenes 5a,b, and amines 6a–f were explored
to extend the scope of the reaction. The results are shown in Table 2.

Table 2 Catalytic Synthesis of Propargylamines 7 via the Three-Component
Addition Reaction
Very good results were obtained for the complete scope
of the reaction
using different cyclic secondary amines such as piperidine (6a), morpholine (6b), or pyrrolidines (6c and 6e) and even noncyclic secondary amines
such as Et2NH (6d) and Bu2NH (6f). Good results were also achieved for the use of different
aldehydes (4a–c) and acetylenes (5a and 5b). For aldehydes 4b,c, which are solids, the addition of a small amount of 100 μL
CH3CN was needed prior to the reaction. Otherwise, the
crude mixture becomes very dense, and the stirring is really difficult.
It is remarkable that our work is one of the scarce examples in which
a gold catalyst is used to promote this process, in addition of using
very low catalyst loading (1 mol %) and short reaction times (5 h).
Our reaction represents an improvement in the synthesis of propargylamines
in comparison with other reported examples where several metal complexes
or metal salts such as Ag(I),72 Cu(I),73 Zn(II),74,75 or Ir(II)76 have been employed, among others, because in
our case lower catalyst loading, shorter reaction times, and lower
temperature were able to promote the process. Moreover, this is one
of the scarce examples where Au(I) has been used against the examples
reported with Au(III) and even in the absence of solvent and without
inert atmosphere. Additionally, in many cases, the authors only used
their catalysts to obtain propargylamines. In contrast and encouraged
by these results, following this simple and effective method, our
next step was to apply this catalytic system in the synthesis of indolizines 8 (Table 3).

Table 3 Scope for the Gold(I)-Catalyzed Multicomponent
Synthesis of Aminoindolizines 8
a Results obtained with catalyst 3b.

Under the same optimized reaction
conditions, the corresponding
1-aminoindolizine products 8 were obtained with very
good yields in short reaction times. The generality of the protocol
was evaluated by the synthesis of differently substituted 1-aminoindolizines 8. Thus, the reaction between pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde (4d) and 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde (4e) with various
secondary amines and terminal alkynes 5a,b affords the desired product in all cases using 1 mol % of catalysts 3a. Interestingly, less studied alkynes 5c and 5d also provided the corresponding final products with moderate
yields, although the starting material remained unreacted. Maybe longer
reaction times would afford better yields. When the process was performed
with aldehyde 4d, the reactions worked with cyclic secondary
amines 6a–c and even noncyclic secondary amines 6d,f, more scarcely employed until now in this
process. Interestingly, 2-quinolinecarboxaldehyde (4e) was also efficiently employed in the reaction with piperidine 6a and different noncyclic secondary amines 6d,f,g, giving rise to the corresponding
aminoindolizine products 8 with very good results. On
the other hand, when aldehyde 4e was used, the final
products were obtained with yield values that were a bit lower compared
with those achieved with 4d. In order to check the effectiveness
of catalyst 3b, we tested some model reactions, and in
all of them, very good results were obtained (Table 3).

The formation of the propargylamines 7 and the corresponding
indolizines 8 can be explained by a plausible mechanism
depicted in Scheme 2 and based on the chemistry of gold14−23 (routes a and b). In both cases, the aldehyde initially reacts with
the secondary amine to generate the iminium ion A. Because
the bases present in the reaction are not able to deprotonate the
terminal alkyne by themselves, the formation of an intermediate π-metal–alkyne
complex is envisioned, involving a C–H activation of the alkyne
by the gold catalyst. Complex B should make the alkyne
proton more acidic for further abstraction. The in situ generated
metal acetylide C reacts with the iminium ion A, giving rise to the formation of the propargylamines 7, releasing the gold catalyst for the subsequent catalytic cycle
(Scheme 2, route a).
Otherwise, if we have a pyridine aldehyde derivative (Scheme 2, route b) once the corresponding
propargylamine D is generated, it undergoes a cyclization
(5 endo-dig) affording intermediate E. In this step,
a plausible activation of the alkyne by the metal to allow the cyclization
is assumed. A subsequent isomerization of E and final
protodeauration of F would release the gold catalyst
to start with the catalytic cycle.

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanistic Reaction
At this stage, we planned to
synthesize chiral-related catalysts
following the same synthetic procedure (Scheme 3). For such a purpose, chiral amines 2b and 2c were selected. Chiral symmetric carbene 3c and nonsymmetric carbene 3d were easily prepared
via the reaction of isocyanide 1a and the chiral amines 2b and 2c, affording the chiral ADCs in very
good yields.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Chiral Gold ADCs
Surprisingly, the chiral complex 3c, which
is analogous
to the racemic mixture 3a, was obtained as the dinuclear
species. As this compound has a greater solubility in dichloromethane,
it does not precipitate from the reaction media, and then the reaction
proceeds to the complete nucleophilic attack of both amine units.
To shed more light on this matter, we have measured the optical rotation
of compound 3a in methanol, which interestingly has a
slightly different value from zero ([α]D20 −1.12), whereas the optical
rotation of complex 3c is [α]D20 −26.07. Therefore, we
propose that there was a slight enrichment in one of the enantiomers
(1S,2S) because of the high insolubility
of this mononuclear species compared to that of the dinuclear 3c, which is the 1R,2R enantiomer.

The analytical data and the mass spectrum corroborate the proposed
formulation. Complex 3c shows NMR spectra with a different
integral ratio for the cyclohexyl protons, similar to that of the
racemic mixture 3a, with the presence of rotamers. In
this case, three resonances for the carbene carbon atom are clearly
observed at 190.9, 185.9, and 185.8 ppm, indicating the presence of
three different rotamers. For complex 3d, three rotamers
are also clearly observed in the 1H NMR spectrum for the
resonances of the tolyl group. The ν(Au–Cl) and ν(N–H)
absorptions are also observed in the IR spectra of these compounds.
The analytical data for both complexes agree with the proposed formulation.

Interestingly, with these two chiral structures, we have demonstrated
the possibility to easily obtain chiral or unsymmetrically substituted
ADCs, also using substituents with steric properties, which is still
a challenging task in the preparation of NHCs. Furthermore, we set
out on the exploration of the reactivity of these promising structures
to generate propargylamines 7aaa and 7aab. Although at this point only <10% of enantiomeric excess has
been reached in a model reaction between benzaldehyde 4a, phenylacetylene 5a, and morpholine 6b, more efforts are necessary to improve these values and they are
currently ongoing in our lab.

Conclusions
In summary, new gold(I)
ADCs have been synthesized following a
straightforward protocol. This synthetic method of the ADC metal complexes
offers a great versatility for the synthesis of gold(I) species with
different scaffolds, including chiral derivatives. These precatalysts
have resulted to be efficient for the preparation of propargylamines
and indolizines. These interesting scaffolds have been achieved following
an easy and green protocol by a three-component coupling of carboxaldehydes,
secondary amines and terminal alkynes. The potential of our procedure
is reflected by the substrate scope, the operational simplicity, short
reaction times, and good to excellent isolated yields. We believe
that these MCRs demonstrate the strong capacity of our complex to
act as an efficient catalyst. In addition, the reactions were performed
under solvent-free conditions, an important feature from a sustainable
point of view, without inert atmosphere and in the presence of light,
in contrast to previous reported examples. The chiral version of these
catalysts has also been synthesized, and the asymmetric catalysis
in the reaction of propargylamines has been tried. The results were
not good probably because the chiral center is far from the catalytic
site of the complex. We cannot discard that the free single bond rotations
in the chiral catalysts, leading to multiple transition states, would
also be responsible for the low ee. Further studies to improve the
design of the catalysts are ongoing in our laboratory.

Experimental
Details
Instrumentation
Purification of reaction products was
carried out by column chromatography using silica gel (0.063–0.200
mm). Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on 0.25 mm
silica gel 60-F plates. 1H and 13C{1H}-APT NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker
AVANCE 400 spectrometer (1H, 400 MHz; 13C, 100.6
MHz) or on a Bruker AVANCE II 300 spectrometer (1H, 300
MHz; 13C, 75.5 MHz), with chemical shifts (ppm) reported
relative to the solvent peaks of the deuterated solvent. CDCl3, CD2Cl2, CD3COCD3, and CD3OD were used as the deuterated solvents. Chemical
shifts were reported in the δ scale relative to residual CHCl3 (7.28 ppm), CH2Cl2 (5.32 ppm), CH3COCH3 (2.05 ppm), and CH3OH (3.31) for 1H NMR and to the central line of CDCl3 (77 ppm),
CD2Cl2 (54 ppm), CD3COCD3 (29.84 ppm), and CD3OD (49.0 ppm) for 13C-APT-NMR.
Mass spectra were recorded on Bruker ESQUIRE 3000 PLUS, with the electrospray
ionization technique. The attenuated total reflection (ATR)–Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of solid samples were recorded on
a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer equipped with a universal ATR sampling
accessory.

Starting Materials
All reactions
were performed under
air atmosphere and solvents were used as received without further
purification or drying. The starting materials [AuCl(CNR)] were prepared
according to published procedures.77−79 Starting materials,
yields, and spectroscopic data for compounds 7abf, 8dad, 8dbf, 8ead, 8eag, and 8ebd are described in the Supporting Information. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra for compounds 7aaa,807aab,817aac,817aad,817aba,827abb,837abc,847abd,857baa,867cac,878daa,678dab,678dac,678daf,888dba,888dbb,898eaa,67 and 8eaf(90) are consistent with the
values previously reported in the literature.

room temperature for 24 h (3a,b,d) or 4 days (3c). Complexes 3a and 3b precipitated as white solids and were filtered off. For
compounds 3c and 3d, the volume was reduced
