Developing Nonenzymatic glucose biosensors
has recently been at
the center of attention owing to their potential application in implantable
and continuous glucose monitoring systems. In this article, nickel
telluride nanostructure with the generic formula of Ni3Te2 has been reported as a highly efficient electrocatalyst
for glucose oxidation, functional at a low operating potential. Ni3Te2 nanostructures were prepared by two synthesis
methods, direct electrodeposition on the electrode and hydrothermal
method. The electrodeposited Ni3Te2 exhibited
a wide linear range of response corresponding to glucose oxidation
exhibiting a high sensitivity of 41.615 mA cm–2 mM–1 and a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.43 μM.
The hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2, on the
other hand, also exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 35.213 mA cm–2 mM–1 and an LOD of 0.38 μM.
The observation of high efficiency for glucose oxidation for both
Ni3Te2 electrodes irrespective of the synthesis
method further confirms the enhanced intrinsic property of the material
toward glucose oxidation. In addition to high sensitivity and low
LOD, Ni3Te2 electrocatalyst also has good selectivity
and long-term stability in a 0.1 M KOH solution. Since it is operative
at a low applied potential of 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl, interference from
other electrochemically active species is reduced, thus increasing
the accuracy of this sensor.

Introduction
In the current society,
diabetes has rapidly grown to be one of
the leading causes of death on a global scale. Diabetes stems from
abnormal blood glucose level, and frequent self-monitoring and continuous
testing of physiological glucose concentration are key to controlling
the advancement of the disease. Continuous blood glucose monitoring
allows for better glycemic control, resulting in lesser fluctuation
of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. By better monitoring
of the glucose concentration in blood, patients are more likely to
prevent the occurrence of diabetic emergencies such as hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia, as well as to avoid long-term complications associated
with the disease, such as kidney failure, blindness, and high blood
pressure.1−4 The conventional approach for monitoring the spread of the disease
and controlling it involves regular sampling of the blood glucose
level via finger pricking, which causes anxiety, tension, and additional
pain to the patients. Also, relying on blood samples collected at
various times throughout the day under different physiological conditions
will provide sporadic results of glucose levels, making this approach
less reliable for the purpose of administering insulins.5,6 Therefore, researchers are trying to develop more convenient glucose
sensors, capable of continuously and reproducibly measuring glucose
levels at different concentrations.

With the advent of modern
monitoring devices, a highly sensitive
and accurate glucose measuring system should be able to reliably detect
glucose from the blood, as well as alternative biofluids, including
saliva, urine, sweat, etc. If diabetic patients are provided with
such noninvasive and convenient glucose sensors, they are more likely
to measure frequent glucose levels, which will allow them to optimize
their insulin injections.7,8 However, glucose concentrations
in these body fluids are as low as 0–0.8 mmol L–1 for urine,9 0.03–0.08 mmol L–1 for saliva,10 and 0.02–0.6
mmol L–1 for sweat,11 requiring the glucose sensors to be highly sensitive with extremely
low limit of detection (LOD) and better selectivity. The rapid response
time and precise measurements achievable by electrochemical sensing
methods have made glucose detection possible from body fluids other
than blood.12 However, conventionally used
enzyme-based glucose sensors still fall short of these requirements
since their efficiencies are influenced by changes in pH and variation
of temperature in addition to the difficulty of immobilizing fragile
enzyme on the electrode surface. The efficiency of enzymatic glucose
sensors can also be affected by the presence of other interfering
compounds in blood.13−16 Due to the high working potential required for electron transfer
between thick enzyme layer and glucose molecules, other redox-active
species present in blood can also oxidize/degrade, thus affecting
the accuracy of glucose sensing.17 According
to recent research developments, all of the crucial parameters including
sensitivity, selectivity, LOD, and stability can be improved by employing
the next-generation glucose sensing modules, namely, the nonenzymatic
glucose sensors.18,19 While enzyme-based sensors are
dependent on thick enzymes to mediate electron transfer, in nonenzymatic
glucose biosensors, on the other hand, the process of glucose oxidation
takes place directly on the electrode surface. Specific glucose oxidation
electrocatalysts anchored on the electrode surface facilitate electron-transfer
process at the electrode–analyte interface, thereby decreasing
the operating potential for glucose oxidation and improving efficiency
of the sensor.20−25

Among nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors, noble
metals
such as Au-based,26−30 Pt-based,31,32 or Pd-based33,34 and their alloys exhibit an enhanced conductivity with an accelerated
electrochemical redox process for glucose biosensing. However, the
scarcity and high cost of these precious metals inhibit their
large-scale usage in practical implementations.35−40 To mitigate this issue, nanocatalysts based on earth-abundant transition
metals have received great attention in virtue of their excellent
redox behavior, natural abundance, lower cost, functional stability
in alkaline medium, and satisfactory biocompatibility.41−43 Among transition metals, Ni-based catalysts are of interest for
electrochemical nonenzymatic glucose sensing owing to their low cost
and remarkably high catalytic activity arising from the facile transformation
of Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple in alkaline medium,
which facilitates the electrooxidation of glucose on the electrode
surface.44−47

Recent studies by several researchers have shown that nickel
chalcogenide-based
electrocatalysts possess unprecedented electrochemical activity toward
several energy conversion processes such as full water splitting48−54 and supercapacitors.55,56 Such enhancement of electrocatalytic
activity of the Ni chalcogenides compared to that of their oxide analogue
is caused by the facile electrochemical redox of the active Ni center,
as well as decreased band gap and increased metallicity of the chalcogenide
lattice compared to that of the oxides, which are higher band-gap
insulators. The higher conductivity of the lattice also enhances electron-transfer
efficiency within transition-metal selenide and telluride composites
compared to that in the corresponding oxides. The trend in catalytic
activity from the oxides to the other chalcogenide series (sulfides,
selenides, and tellurides) can also be explained through their gradual
change in the electronegativity of the chalcogen atom. As the electronegativity
of the chalcogen atom decreases down the series, the degree of covalency
in metal–chalcogen bond increases. Since the electrocatalytic
efficiency is enhanced by a higher degree of covalency in metal–anion
bonding, it is expected that the catalytic efficiency will increase
in the chalcogenide series from oxide to telluride.48,56 Moreover, the higher applied potentials required for nickel-based
oxides decrease the efficiency of these electrodes toward glucose
biosensing. Ni chalcogenides, on the other hand, being electrochemically
active at a much lower applied potential can significantly increase
the catalytic efficiency for direct glucose oxidation.57,58

In this study, the electrocatalytic activity of nickel telluride
nanostructures with the molecular formula of Ni3Te2 has been reported for direct glucose oxidation in an alkaline
medium. The Ni3Te2 electrocatalyst composite
has been synthesized by two approaches: direct electrodeposition and
one-step hydrothermal synthesis. Both of these catalyst composites
show similar activity toward the oxidation of glucose to gluconolactone,
indicating that it is indeed an intrinsic property for Ni3Te2 independent of the synthesis method. High sensitivity
and low LOD were obtained with the Ni3Te2 electrocatalyst
at low applied potentials for glucose oxidation, making this compound
promising for nonenzymatic glucose biosensors.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
and Composition
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of the as-grown electrodeposited films shows randomly
oriented nanoflakes on the surface of Ni foam, as shown in Figure 1a. Such a nanoflake
geometry expectedly increases the active surface area of the electrocatalyst
composite leading to better exposure of the catalytic sites to the
analyte present in the electrolyte, thus improving catalytic interaction.
SEM image of the hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2, on the other hand, shows leaflike dendritic nanostructures on the
electrode surface (Figure 1c). It is worth mentioning that Ni3Te2 grown on Ni foam both by electrodeposition and by hydrothermal methods
shows high surface area amenable for superior catalytic activity.
The Ni3Te2 nanostructures were also analyzed
through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results have
been included in our previous publication.48 TEM images show granular particle-like and flake-like morphologies
for the hydrothermally synthesized and electrodeposited Ni3Te2, respectively.

(d) PXRD analysis of hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 catalysts along with the reference (PDF #04-014-3418) pattern.

The PXRD patterns of the electrodeposited
Ni3Te2, as well as the hydrothermally synthesized
Ni3Te2 on Ni foam (NF), show the presence of
pure Ni3Te2, where the diffraction peaks matched
with those
reported for standard Ni3Te2 (PDF #04-014-3418),
as shown in Figure 1b,d. Both PXRD patterns show that the product formed was a pure phase
with no other evident impurity peaks. It was also observed that the
relative peak intensities and peak widths were different between the
hydrothermally synthesized and electrodeposited Ni3Te2. Such differences can be explained by the smaller nanostructures
in the electrodeposited sample, which causes broadening of the diffraction
peak, and possible oriented growth in the electrodeposited film, which
has been previously observed for NiSe2.51

Electrochemical Measurements
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV)
and chronoamperometry measurements were performed with an Iviumstat
potentiostat under continuous stirring in a three-electrode electrochemical
setup, where Ni3Te2–NF served as the
working electrode, while a platinum mesh and Ag|AgCl electrode were
selected as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. An
aqueous 0.1 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte.

The
limit of detection (LOD) was calculated according to the following
equation (eq 1)59−61 1  where SD is the standard deviation of the
analyte concentration calculated from the current response of the
consecutive addition of glucose into the electrolyte and N is the slope of the calibration curve, which indicates the sensitivity
of the electrode with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.

The electrochemical
active surface area (ECSA) was estimated by
measuring the double-layer charging current at different scan rates
based on the following equation (eq 2)49 2  where Cs is the
specific capacitance (0.040 mF cm–2) in a N2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and CDL is the double-layer capacitance calculated from the slope of the
plot of capacitive current (iDL) in a
nonfaradic double-layer region against scan rate v (V s–1). The ECSA was measured to be 13.0 cm2 for electrodeposited
Ni3Te2 and 20.2 cm2 for hydrothermally
synthesized Ni3Te2, as shown in the Supporting
Information (Figures S1 and S2, respectively).

Electrochemical Behavior of Electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF Electrode
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is known
to be useful for investigating the electrochemical behavior of the
electrode. The CV plots and influence of the scan rate on the current
density of electrodeposited Ni3Te2 in 0.1 M
KOH in the absence of glucose are provided in Figure 2a. As shown in Figures 2a and S1, by increasing
the scan rate from 10 to 80 mV s–1, the current
density changes proportionally with the square root of scan rate,
implying a typical diffusion-controlled electrochemical process at
the surface of the electrode.

Ni3Te2 at different scan rates. The inset shows
the cathodic peak

vs square root of scan rate. (b) Response of electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF electrode in 0.1 M KOH containing

low glucose concentration. (e) Corresponding calibration curve of
the response current density as a function of glucose concentration.
(f) Response time of the sensor to achieve steady-state current density
upon the addition of glucose.

The CV response of electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF electrode in the presence of different concentrations
of glucose in the electrolyte is presented in Figure 2b. It can be seen from this figure that an
explicit oxidation peak located at 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl was observed
in the presence of glucose with concentrations ranging from 1 to 4
mM. The enhancement of anodic peak current densities was more obvious
with the increase of glucose concentration, suggesting high electrocatalytic
activity of electrodeposited Ni3Te2 toward glucose
electrooxidation. It is worth mentioning that upon the addition of
1.0 mM glucose, bare Ni foam did not show any oxidation peak corresponding
to glucose oxidation in the working potential ranging from 0 to 0.5
V vs Ag|AgCl (Figure S3), confirming that
the substrate by itself was not an active electrocatalyst for glucose
oxidation.

The large current densities achieved by electrodeposited
Ni3Te2 electrode in the presence of a 4 mM glucose
concentration, reveal another potential application of this electrode
in a nonenzymatic glucose fuel cell.62 Currently,
the development of implantable medical devices has been limited due
to the slow improvements in lithium-ion battery technology. Glucose
fuel cells are potential candidates to replace the lithium-ion batteries
due to their superior long-term stability, sufficient power density,
and abundance of glucose in the body to generate a continuous and
stable power output. However, the main challenge for enzymatic glucose
fuel cells is the poor anode selectivity toward glucose oxidation
in the presence of oxygen in the body tissue.63−65 Nonenzymatic
glucose fuel cell with a high current response and excellent selectivity
can be a feasible solution for improvements in power generation for
implantable medical devices. It can be concluded from Figure 2b that electrodeposited Ni3Te2 can be a potential choice for this technology,
as it shows a high current density of about 45 mA cm–2 in the presence of 4 mM glucose.

Electrocatalytic Oxidation
of Glucose on Electrodeposited Ni3Te2
A high amperometric current response
during detection of glucose can be strongly affected by the applied
potential. Large applied potential can trigger oxygen evolution reaction
at the anode, which leads to a large background anodic current and
dwindling of the active surface area.66 Therefore, to determine the optimum working potential for glucose
sensing, the amperometric response of the Ni3Te2–NF electrode was recorded at different applied potentials.
As Figure 2c shows,
with the successive addition of 0.01 mM of glucose into a 0.1 M KOH
solution, the catalytic current of electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF electrode elevated with the increase of
applied potential from 0.30 to 0.35 V but then decays at 0.40 V potential.
Therefore, 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl was selected as the optimal applied potential
for electrodeposited Ni3Te2 electrode, which
enables the best sensing performance for glucose oxidation. It should
be noted here that this is one of the lowest potentials reported for
electrocatalytic glucose oxidation and is much lower than that of
oxide-based sensors. The onset of electrocatalytic glucose oxidation
at such low working potential validates our initial hypothesis and
confirms that replacing oxides by chalcogenides such as selenides
and tellurides enhances electrode activation at lower potential and
will result in a high selectivity of the electrode.67 Additionally, the reduced band gap in selenides and tellurides
also leads to better electrical conductivity and charge transfer in
the catalyst composite, leading to high current densities at low applied
potentials.

The mechanism of glucose oxidation is believed to
be initiated by the hydroxyl attachment on the catalytically active
transition-metal site, Ni(III), which is generated in situ through
local site oxidation of Ni(II) (catalyst activation). The electron
transfer is then initiated between the glucose molecule and the hydroxyl-activated
catalytic site, leading to glucose oxidation to gluconolactone and
further redox of the transition-metal catalytic site.68 Since the catalytically active transition-metal site undergoes
a reversible oxidation–reduction cycle during the mechanism
of glucose oxidation, the redox potential for the transition-metal
sites can have a large influence on the catalytic efficiency for glucose
oxidation, especially the applied potential value. Previous research
from our group has shown that the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox
potential can be shifted to more cathodic potential in Ni3Te2 compared to Ni oxides,48 thereby reducing the applied potential for catalyst activation.

The amperometric response of the electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF was measured at a constant applied potential
of 0.35 V with successive addition of different concentrations of
glucose into the alkaline solution under continuous stirring and is
shown in Figure 2d.
The inset shows the magnified version of the amperometric response
at low glucose concentrations. As can be seen from these plots, the
current response illustrated a high sensitivity of the electrode to
glucose concentration as low as 0.01 μM, which can easily be
detected by electrodeposited Ni3Te2 electrode.
The calibration curve shown in Figure 2e, obtained by plotting the steady-state current density
values vs the glucose concentrations, reveals two linear regions.
In the low-glucose-concentration ranges from 0.01 μM to 0.8
mM, the response is linear with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 41.615
mA mM–1 cm–2 (R2 = 0.9977). While the second linear region between 1
and 4 mM shows a sensitivity of 9.26 mA mM–1 cm–2 (R2 = 0.9975). For the
linear range from 0.01 μM to 0.8 mM, based on eq 1, the LOD was estimated to be 0.43
μM with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3).

As can
be seen from Figure 2f, a rapid current response was achieved upon the addition
of glucose, reaching the steady-state current in less than 2 s. The
fast response time demonstrates competent activity of electrodeposited
Ni3Te2 electrode toward glucose sensing.

Figure 3a shows
the amperometric responses of electrodeposited Ni3Te2 to stepwise injections of 0.01 mM of glucose to 0.1 M KOH
at 0.35 V, wherein current response from different batches of
electrodes were measured under identical experimental conditions.
It was observed that the addition of a similar concentration of glucose
resulted in almost identical jumps in current density. This repeatability
of the results confirms the reliability of Ni3Te2 as a sensor, as well as its functional stability in an alkaline
medium, along with reproducibility of the results.

addition of 0.01 mM glucose at 0.35 V.
(b) Interference assessment performance of the electrodeposited Ni3Te2 upon the addition of 0.1 mM glucose and 0.01
mM of interfering species, as identified in the diagram. (c) Long-term
stability check of the electrode measured for 7 days. (d) Prolonged
chronoamperometry test with the addition of 0.1 mM glucose to 0.1
M KOH.

For an electrochemical glucose
sensor, selectivity is a crucial
feature to assess the ability of the electrode to be utilized in practical
applications. Normally, certain biomolecules such as ascorbic acid,
fructose, sucrose, and lactose coexist with glucose in human blood.
These interfering species may
also undergo electrochemical oxidation, thus producing background
current signal at high applied potentials, which will affect the accurate determination
of glucose concentration. Hence, an experiment was conducted for examining
the selectivity of the electrodeposited Ni3Te2–NF electrode, where the amperometric current response of
electrodeposited Ni3Te2 to the sequential addition
of 0.1 mM of glucose and 0.01 mM of a number of interfering compounds
including ascorbic acid, dopamine, lactose, fructose, sucrose, uric
acid, KCl, and NaCl was measured at an applied potential of 0.35 V
vs Ag|AgCl, and the results are shown in Figure 3b. It is clearly seen that the electrochemical
signals from interferant species are negligible compared to the significant
jump of current density observed with the addition of glucose, confirming
superior selectivity of Ni3Te2 electrode towards
glucose oxidation.

Long-term stability and repeatability of
the Ni3Te2–NF electrode towards glucose
sensing were estimated
by checking the electrode response to the addition of similar concentration
of glucose over a week where the electrode was stored under ambient
conditions and reused. Figure 3c shows the results of these tests, and it can be clearly
seen that the electrode produced similar response throughout, indicating
stability and repeatability of the sensor. Even after being exposed
to air for 7 days, electrodeposited Ni3Te2 retained
at least 96% of its original current response.

The reproducibility
of the electrode toward glucose oxidation
was also tested by adding 0.1 mM of glucose to 0.1 M KOH under constant
stirring. After almost 3 h, electrodeposited Ni3Te2 completely oxidized all of the added glucose, reducing the
current density to nearly zero. Fresh addition of 0.1 mM of glucose
at this point immediately increased the current density to a value
almost similar to the previous value, as shown in Figure 3d, confirming the reproducibility
of the current response of the sensor.

Electrochemical Behavior
of Hydrothermally Synthesized Ni3Te2
Hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 was assembled
on the electrode surface, as
discussed above. Similar to electrodeposited Ni3Te2, hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 was
also tested for glucose sensing in 0.1 M KOH by collecting CV scans
in the absence and presence of glucose. The CV plots shown in Figure 4a represent the current
response in the absence of glucose and were performed in the potential
range from 0 to +0.45 V vs Ag|AgCl with scan rates increasing from
10 to 80 mV s–1. The cathodic current measured was
proportional to the square root of scan rate, as shown in the inset,
suggesting a typical diffusion-controlled process for the hydrothermally
prepared Ni3Te2 electrode.

Figure 4 (a) CVs of the hydrothermally
synthesized Ni3Te2 in a 0.1 M KOH medium at
various scan rates (10–80
mV s–1). The inset shows the cathodic peak currents
of hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2–NF
electrodes as a function of the square root of scan rate. (b) CVs
of the hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrode
with glucose concentration increased from 1 to 4 mM. (c) Amperometric
responses at different working potentials ranging from 0.30 to 0.40
V to the successive addition of 0.1 mM glucose to 0.1 M KOH. (d) Amperometric
response of the hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 at 0.35 V to the stepwise addition of different concentrations of
glucose. The inset shows the zoomed-in response of the electrode at
lower glucose concentration. (e) Corresponding calibration curve of
response current density vs glucose concentration. (f) Response time
of the electrode to glucose oxidation.

Upon the addition of different concentrations of glucose
ranging
from 1 to 4 mM, a notable enhancement of the anodic current density
was observed, while the peak oxidation potential stayed at almost
the same position, demonstrating the electrode’s activity toward
glucose oxidation. It is well established that the enhancement of
the oxidative current is attributed to the electrooxidation of glucose
in the presence of Ni(III).69

The
high current density of almost 30 mA cm–2 is achieved
by the hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 in the
presence of 4 mM glucose. This result shows that the
hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrodes, similar
to those made through electrodeposition, have the potential of being
used in devices for energy conversion from glucose.

Glucose Oxidation
with Hydrothermally Prepared Ni3Te2
As mentioned above, applied potential can
strongly affect the magnitude of current response for the glucose
sensor. Therefore, we have analyzed the current response with respect
to variations in the applied potential to select an optimal potential. Figure 4c shows the amperometric
responses of hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 to the sequential addition of 0.1 mM of glucose at different applied
potentials ranging from 0.30 to 0.40 V. Based on the observed current
response, the optimal potential for amperometric detection of glucose
was selected to be 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl, which aligns with CV results
mentioned above.

Amperometric response upon successive
addition of different concentrations of glucose into a constantly
stirred 0.1 M KOH solution was measured at 0.35 V and is shown in Figure 4d. In this figure,
distinct increases in amperometric currents were observed with the
stepwise increase of added glucose concentration, demonstrating superior
catalytic ability of hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrode for glucose electrooxidation. The inset shows current
response of the sensor in the region of low added-glucose concentrations,
confirming the ability of the sensor to reliably detect even minute
amounts of glucose, which leads to high sensitivity of the electrode
toward glucose electrooxidation.

The amperometric current response
with the addition of varying
amounts of glucose was used to obtain the calibration curve, as shown
in Figure 4e. It was
observed that there were two linear regions in the calibration curve,
one at the lower glucose concentration (up to 0.8 mM) and the other
at the higher glucose concentration (1–4 mM). The linear fit
in the low-glucose-concentration region (0.01–0.8 mM) showed
an ultrahigh sensitivity of 35.213 mA mM–1 cm–2 (R2 = 0.9957). The LOD
was as low as 0.38 μM, based on the signal/noise value of 3
(S/N = 3). The sensitivity in the higher glucose concentration from
1.0 to 4.0 mM was calculated to be 9.802 mA mM–1 cm–2 (R2 = 0.9966).
At higher glucose concentration, the amperometric current density
gradually reaches a saturation due to the presence of adsorbed reaction
intermediates on the electrode surface covering the available active
sites. This may lead to insufficient active sites to oxidize the incoming
glucose on the electrode surface. The addition of glucose in the vicinity
of the electrode produces a sharp increase in current density with
a response time of less than 4 s, as can be seen in Figure 4f. Such low response time verifies
the high catalytic activity of hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 toward glucose oxidation. The Ni3Te2 electrodes were also analyzed through electroimpedance spectroscopy
(EIS), and from the fitting of the EIS spectra (as shown in Figure S4), the Rct (charge-transfer resistance) values were estimated to be 45.38 Ω
for electrodeposited Ni3Te2 and 45.98 Ω
for hydrothermal Ni3Te2. Such small charge-transfer
resistances are indicative of fast charge-transfer kinetics at the
electrode–electrolyte interface and low contact resistance.

The reproducibility of the results, as well as the reliability
of these measurements, was tested by measuring the electrochemical
response from several electrodes assembled from different batches
of hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2. It was
observed that the different electrodes showed an almost identical
jump in current densities with the addition of same concentrations
of glucose (0.1 mM) in 0.1 M KOH at 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl, as shown in Figure 5a. Such an identical
current response between different electrodes and different addition
events confirmed the excellent stability and reproducibility of these
electrodes.

Figure 5 (a) Amperometric response of different batches of hydrothermally
synthesized Ni3Te2–NF electrodes to the
stepwise addition of similar concentrations of glucose in an alkaline
solution. (b) Amperometric response of the electrode to the addition
of glucose (0.1 mM) and other interfering species (0.01 mM), as mentioned
in the diagram. (c) Extensive stability check of the Ni3Te2–NF electrode measured for 7 days. (d) Continuous
chronoamperometric test to the addition of identical concentrations
of glucose, as well as the complete oxidation time.

One of the major challenges in nonenzymatic glucose
sensing, as
mentioned above, is to eliminate the interference from biomolecules
coexisting in the blood such as dopamine, ascorbic acid, urea, salts,
fructose, etc. In physiological conditions, the level of glucose is
much higher than that of these interfering species (<0.5 mM).64,66 Hence, the selectivity of the hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2–NF electrode was determined toward glucose
oxidation in the presence of added interferent species by measuring
the current response upon the addition of 0.1 mM of glucose followed
by successive additions of 0.01 mM of ascorbic acid, dopamine, lactose,
fructose, sucrose, uric acid, KCl, and NaCl, as shown in Figure 5b. It was found that
the hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrode
provides remarkable response only for glucose electrooxidation, while
the addition of other species had a negligible effect on the anodic
current.

The long-term stability of this nonenzymatic sensor
was also evaluated
through amperometric response for the specific concentration of glucose
recorded for over a week (Figure 5c). The hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrode was stored in air when not in use and was reused
for this study. The results indicate that the sensor retained more
than 94% of its initial current response, suggesting favorable long-term
stability and reproducibility of this nonenzymatic glucose sensor.

To investigate the cyclability of the hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2 electrode, a chronoamperometry experiment was
carried out, where 0.1 mM glucose was injected into 0.1 M of KOH at
0.35 V and the oxidation current was allowed to decay down, indicating
full oxidation of the added glucose. This electrode needed almost
5 h to convert all of the added glucose to gluconolactone. Glucose
solution (0.1 mM) was added again to this electrolyte, which resulted
in similar current density as the initial addition of glucose (Figure 5d), confirming data
reliability and reproducibility for long-term tests.

The Ni3Te2 electrode was also analyzed through
SEM and PXRD to investigate the structural and compositional stability
after a prolonged period of glucose oxidation. SEM analysis showed
that both hydrothermally synthesized and electrodeposited Ni3Te2 maintained their respective morphologies after chronoamperometric
test, as shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting
Information. The compositions of the electrodes were also found to
remain unchanged as evidenced by PXRD patterns after chronoamperometric
tests, as shown in Figure S6. These studies
further confirmed that the Ni3Te2 electrodes
were indeed stable for long-term glucose oxidation with no structural
or morphological degradation.

Human Blood Glucose Determination
To verify the possibility
of the Ni3Te2 sensor in practical application,
Ni3Te2–NF electrode was used to test
human blood glucose concentration. As provided in Table S1, Ni3Te2 sensor shows excellent
performance toward glucose detection in physiological blood samples.
To quantify the glucose level in blood samples, first, the human
blood samples obtained from three participating volunteers were tested
with the commercially available glucometer (ReliOn). The electrochemical
test was then carried out by initially adding 100 μL of
1 mM glucose solution 2 times to the electrolyte (0.05 M KOH) to
stabilize the system’s current response. Then, 100 μL
of the human blood sample was directly injected into the 0.05 M KOH
followed by two more additions of 1 mM glucose. The current response
for each of the standard glucose additions (i.e., 1 mM glucose solution)
was recorded and plotted as a function of concentration producing
a linear plot, as shown in Figure S7. The
level of the glucose present in the blood sample was estimated from
the linear fit of the plot (after subtracting the background glucose
concentrations).64 As shown in Table S1, the glucose concentration measured
with Ni3Te2-based sensor, regardless of the
fabrication method, was in good agreement with the results obtained
from the commercial glucometer, confirming the possibility of Ni3Te2 as a promising sensor for human blood glucose
testing.

Another growing emphasis for nonenzymatic glucose,
especially with respect to the continuous glucose monitoring system,
is to develop sensors that can detect very low amounts of glucose
present in other bodily fluids such as sweat, urine, tears, tissue
fluid, etc. Detecting sudden spikes in glucose levels is also important
to control diabetes. Hence, to demonstrate the capability of the Ni3Te2 electrode for testing low concentrations of
glucose, such as those that might be present in tissue and other biological
fluids, different solutions containing low concentrations of glucose
were prepared, and the level of glucose was tested with a commercially
available glucose biosensor. Then, the glucose solutions were added
to our three-electrode system to measure the current responses. As
shown in Table S1, the results from both
electrodeposited Ni3Te2 and hydrothermally synthesized
Ni3Te2 were in good agreement with the results
obtained from ReliOn glucometer. The relative standard deviation below
3.5% verified the superior electrochemical performance of Ni3Te2 as a promising candidate for an effective glucose
sensing platform.

Moreover, the possibility of detecting small
changes in glucose
level in a glucose-enriched solution was tested. Figure 6a,d shows the injection of
0.1, 1, and 5 μM of glucose to 0.1 M KOH and the corresponding
changes in current density for electrodeposited Ni3Te2, as well as hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2, respectively. Then, 5 mM of glucose was added to a 0.1 M
KOH solution to resemble the normal glucose level in blood. Figure 6b,c demonstrates
the effect of injection of 5, 1, and 0.1 μM of glucose to this
alkaline solution containing 5 mM glucose for electrodeposited and
hydrothermally prepared Ni3Te2, respectively.
It should be noted here that small change in glucose level was detected
reliably even in the presence of high glucose concentration. The difference
between the current response measured from glucose addition to an
alkaline medium with zero initial concentration of glucose and the
injection of similar concentrations of glucose to an electrolyte containing
5 mM of glucose is compared in Figure 6c,e. It can be concluded from these figures that the
standard deviation in detecting small glucose concentration reliably
was small in the lower concentration range. In the higher-glucose-concentration
range, detecting an accurate concentration of glucose was challenging
due to the considerable background current generated by the presence
of the excess amount of glucose, which reduced the availability of
the active sites for a new analyte on the catalyst surface. However,
Ni3Te2 electrode can successfully detect even
minute amounts of increase in glucose concentration in a glucose-rich
medium to a reliable extent. Such capabilities will be extremely useful
to detect spikes in glucose concentrations under physiological conditions.

To the best of our knowledge, the functional parameters for
this
nonenzymatic sensor based on Ni3Te2 including
sensitivity, LOD, and working potential are considerably better than
the previously reported sensors, as can be seen from the comparison, Table S2. It can be concluded from this table
that the extremely low working potential along with ultrahigh sensitivity
of Ni3Te2 validated our initial hypothesis that
replacing oxides and selenides with tellurides can lower the band
gap, enhance the redox activity of the Ni site, and consequently lower
the applied potential to 0.35 V vs Ag|AgCl. From our previous research,
it was also observed that Ni3Te2 surface exhibited
favorable −OH adsorption kinetics on the Ni site, leading to
catalyst activation at lower potential.48 Since glucose oxidation follows catalyst activation and initiates
at the S–OH site (S = catalytically
active transition-metal ion), improved catalyst activation at low
applied potential will have a positive influence on enhancing the
glucose oxidation catalytic activity. The low working potential can
overcome one of the biggest challenges associated with these nonenzymatic
sensors, which is the selectivity of the electrode toward glucose
oxidation. This modest working potential will make Ni3Te2 an ideal candidate for smaller, economical, and energy-efficient
glucometers.

Conclusions
In this study, two convenient
electrochemical synthesis processes
of electrodeposition and hydrothermal synthesis were employed to prepare
Ni3Te2 nanostructures on Ni foam. The morphology,
composition, and electrocatalytic performance of the binder-free electrodes
were carefully characterized by various techniques. Both developed
nonenzymatic sensors showed a superior catalytic activity toward the
electrochemical oxidation of glucose. For electrodeposited Ni3Te2, an extremely high sensitivity of 41.615 mA
mM–1 cm–2 with a low LOD of 0.43
μM in a range between 0.01 and 0.8 mM and 9.26 mA mM–1 cm–2 for the range of 1.0–4.0 mM was measured
along with the other advantages associated with this electrode such
as fast response, excellent selectivity, and long-term stability and
repeatability. The hydrothermally synthesized Ni3Te2 electrode also provides a high sensitivity of 35.213 mA mM–1 cm–2 from 0.01 μM to 0.8
mM with an LOD as low as 0.38 μM and 9.802 mA mM–1 cm–2 from 1 to 4 mM. Excellent selectivity, reproducibility
of current response, and long-term functional stability of this electrode
verified the intrinsic properties of Ni3Te2 toward
glucose sensing through direct electrooxidation. It can be concluded
that Ni3Te2 is a potential material for the
development of an enzyme-free sensor for reliable glucose determination.

Experimental
Section
All chemicals used in this research were used as
purchased, without
further purification. Nickel sulfate (NiSO4·6H2O) was purchased from Fisher Scientific, and tellurium dioxide
(TeO2) and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) were purchased from Acros Organics. Dextrose
and dopamine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, ascorbic acid, sodium
chloride, potassium chloride, and lactose were obtained from Fisher
Scientific, and fructose from Sigma-Aldrich. Ni foam was employed
as a substrate in both electrodeposition and hydrothermal synthesis.
Deionized water (DI water) was used to prepare all of the solutions.
Ni foam was rinsed with dilute HCl and DI water prior to the preparation
of Ni3Te2 electrode.

Electrodeposition of Ni3Te2
Direct
electrodeposition was carried out in a conventional three-electrode
system using an IviumStat potentiostat, with Ni foam as the working
electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag|AgCl as the reference
electrode. The electrolyte contained 15 mM of nickel sulfate and 3
mM of tellurium dioxide and was maintained at 80 °C with a pH
of 2.5 by the addition of dilute HCl. Ni3Te2 was deposited on precleaned Ni foam at −1.05 V (vs Ag|AgCl).

Hydrothermal Synthesis of Ni3Te2
NiSO4·6H2O (9.0 mM) was dissolved in 15.0
mL of deionized water under vigorous magnetic stirring. Then, TeO2 (6.0 mM) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for
20 min to form a homogeneous solution. Finally, N2H4·H2O (3.0 mL) was added to the mixture and
stirred continuously for another 10 min. The resulting solution was
transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. Precleaned
Ni foam was placed inside the autoclave, which was sealed and maintained
at 185 °C for 20 h. Later, it was naturally cooled down to room
temperature. The prepared electrode was washed several times with
DI water to remove impurities. The product was dried in a vacuum oven
at 60 °C for 24 h.

A detailed description of the synthesis
procedure and morphological and structural studies has been reported
in our previous work.48

Characterization
Powder
X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)

a Philips X-Pert X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands,
λ = 1.5418 Å). The PXRD pattern was collected from 2θ
values of 10–90°.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
SEM images of Ni3Te2 were acquired
using an FEI Helios NanoLab 600
FIB/FESEM operating at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a working
distance of 5.0 mm to study the morphology of the product.
