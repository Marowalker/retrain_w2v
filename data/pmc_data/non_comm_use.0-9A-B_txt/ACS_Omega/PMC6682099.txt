The
organophosphate scale inhibitor (HEDP)-containing C–P
bond is an agent widely used in the circulating cooling system to
ensure the safe operation. In order to explore the effects of its
decomposition and migration transformation in the system on the system
security, it is necessary to carry out the quantitative and qualitative
analysis of organic phosphorus in fouling. According to the Ivanoff
method, with the organic phosphorus extraction rate as an indicator,
the types and concentrations of extractants, extraction time, and
mass of the extracted scale were optimized. When the mass of the extracted
scale was 0.4 g, the extraction rates of active organic phosphorus
and moderately active organic phosphorus were, respectively, 46.53
and 47.14%, and there was no inactive organic phosphorus and residual
phosphorus. The total extraction rate of organic phosphorus was up
to 94.32%. The optimum extraction conditions of various organic phosphorus
components were determined as follows: 10 h extraction in 0.5 mol/L
KHCO3 for active organic phosphorus and 3 h extraction
in 1.0 mol/L HCl solution for moderately active organic phosphorus.
The optimized extraction process only involves two steps: acid extraction
of active organic phosphorus and acid extraction of moderately active
organic phosphorus. The optimized method is characterized by the simple
operation and good extraction effect and can be applied in the detection
and analysis of organic phosphorus in the fouling of the circulating
cooling system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phosphorus affects scaling,
corrosion, and microbial growth in
circulating cooling systems as well as the safe operation of the system.1−4 At present, the organic phosphorus scale and corrosion inhibitors
are the dominant water quality stabilizers with good performance and
low price. As shown in Figure 1, HEDP, ATMP, and EDTMP with −C–PO3H2 functional groups can protect the system for safe operation.5−10 However, the degradation or transformation of organic phosphorus
agents in the system may generate various phosphorus forms, which
affect the inhibition performance of the agents.11−14 Therefore, the migration mechanism
of organic phosphorus in the system is the important basis for ensuring
the operation safety. The extraction method of organic phosphorus
in fouling is the primary prerequisite for studying the migration
mechanism.

Figure 1 Formula and structures of HEDP, ATMP, and EDTMP.

The current methods for the continuous extraction
of organic phosphorus
mainly include the Ivanoff method,15 the
Bowman–Cole method,16 and the Golterman
method.17 These methods were initially
established for the extraction of organic phosphorus in the soil and
then optimized and applied in the studies on the migration and transformation
of phosphorus in the water–sediment interface of rivers, especially
phosphorus forms in riverbed sediments.18−21 However, the extraction method
of organic phosphorus in the scale of the circulating cooling system
was not reported. In the study, based on the comparative analysis
of various methods, according to the Ivanoff method, the extraction
process was optimized based on the organic phosphorus storage system
(soil and sludge). Then, the conditions for the continuous extraction
of organic phosphorus in the fouling, including the type and concentration
of the extractant, extraction time, and mass of the extracted scale,
were optimized in terms of the extraction efficiency of organic phosphorus
(active organic phosphorus and moderately active organic phosphorus).
The established optimization method lays a foundation for studying
the migration and transformation of organic phosphorus in the system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Extraction Step Optimization
It can
be seen from Table 1 that the extraction procedure of active organic phosphorus in the
fouling of the circulating cooling system is simplified as one-step
extraction with KHCO3 because there is no biologically
active organic phosphorus in the residues.

The extraction steps
of moderately active organic phosphorus are
significantly different. The soil phosphorus analysis involves acid
extraction and alkali extraction. Acid extraction (HCl) aimed to eliminate
the effect of inorganic phosphorus on the extraction of organic phosphorus.
The inorganic phosphorus and moderately active organic phosphorus
were extracted with HCl. The components of the fouling were minerals,
and the content of inorganic phosphorus was low. After the fouling
was extracted with HCl, there was no residue and alkali extraction
was not required, indicating that only active organic phosphorus and
moderately active organic phosphorus (extracted with acid) existed
in the fouling. Po-HCl is moderately active organic
phosphorus (extracted with acid) without inactive organic phosphorus
and residual phosphorus. The optimization method had two steps. First,
KHCO3 solution was used to extract active organic phosphorus,
and HCl was used to extract moderately active organic phosphorus from
the residues. However, the existence of inorganic phosphorus in the
fouling reduced the apparent extraction rate of HCl.

In view
of the fact that there was little inorganic phosphorus
in the fouling, we attempted to extract organic phosphorus directly
with NaOH. Moderately active organic phosphorus and inactive organic
phosphorus were obtained. It was also found that there was no inactive
organic phosphorus in the extracts, but the residues still existed.
The residues were treated according to the Ivanoff method, and the
total phosphorus was measured to be close to zero. Energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicated
the presence of trace inorganic phosphorus. The analysis further verified
that the organic phosphorus in the fouling only contained active organic
phosphorus and moderately active organic phosphorus (extracted with
alkali). The residual phosphorus was inorganic phosphorus. The optimized
extraction method is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Organic phosphorus extraction optimized method.

The extraction conditions for
active organic phosphorus, moderately
active organic phosphorus extracted with acid, and moderately active
organic phosphorus extracted with alkali were, respectively, optimized,
and the optimal method was determined according to the total extraction
rate of organic phosphorus.

2.2 Optimization of Active
Organic Phosphorus
Extraction
2.2.1 Extractant Type
Under the experimental
conditions of 0.3 g of the extracted scale, 10 h extraction, and centrifugation
(8000 rpm, 10 min), the effects of the extractant type on the extraction
rate of active organic phosphorus are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Effects of the extractant type on the extraction
rate of active
organic phosphorus.

The type of extractant
had a great influence on the extraction
rate of active organic phosphorus, and the extraction rate of the
strong alkali weak acid extractant was significantly higher than that
of the neutral extractant (Figure 3). When KHCO3 was used as the extractant,
the extraction rate of active organic phosphorus was the highest,
46.16%, whereas the extraction rate of H2O was only 11.76%.
Therefore, KHCO3 was the optimal extractant for active
organic phosphorus.

2.2.2 Extractant Concentration
Under
the experimental conditions of 0.3 g of the extracted scale, 20 mL
of KHCO3 solution as the extractant, 10 h extraction, and
centrifugation (8000 rpm, 10 min), the effects of KHCO3 concentration on the extraction rate of active organic phosphorus
are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effects of KHCO3 concentration on the extraction rate
of active organic phosphorus.

The extraction rate increased with the increase in the concentration
of extractants, Figure 4. The variation might be interpreted as follows. When the extractant
concentration increased, the number of extractant molecules per unit
volume was increased, and the effective collisions between extractant
molecules and active organic phosphorus molecules were increased.
Therefore, the extraction process was more complete. When the extractant
concentration increased to 0.5 mol/L, the extraction rate tended to
be stable at 45.66%. After the concentration was increased above 0.5
mol/L, the extraction rate did not increase significantly. When the
extractant concentration was 1.0 mol/L, the extraction rate was only
1.32% higher than that at 0.5 mol/L. Considering the consumption of
the agent and the extraction efficiency, we determined the optimum
concentration of KHCO3 as 0.5 mol/L.

2.2.3 Extraction Time
Under the experimental
conditions of 0.3 g of the extracted scale, 20 mL of 0.5 mol/L KHCO3 solution as the extractant, and centrifugation (8000 rpm,
10 min), the effects of extraction time on the extraction rate of
active organic phosphorus are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Effects of extraction time on the extraction
rate of active organic
phosphorus.

The extraction rate generally
increased with the extension of extraction
time, but the increase was not significant (Figure 5). At the beginning of the shaking extraction
stage, the extractant reacted with the scale rapidly, and a large
amount of active organic phosphorus was extracted. With the extension
of extraction time, the extraction agent had a higher contacting probability
with active organic phosphorus, so the extraction rate continued to
increase. After 10 h extraction, the extraction rate of active organic
phosphorus reached 46.53% and tended to be stable, indicating that
the extraction process was completed. In order to ensure that the
active organic phosphorus could be fully extracted, the optimal extraction
time was selected as 10 h.

2.3 Optimization
of Moderately Active Organic
Phosphorus Extraction
The extraction method of moderately
active organic phosphorus was optimized by the acid method (HCl solution
as the extractant) and alkali method (NaOH solution as the extractant).

2.3.1 Extractant Concentration
Under
the experimental conditions of 20 mL of HCl/NaOH solution as the extractant,
extraction time of 5 h/20 h, and centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min),
the effects of extractant concentration on the extraction rate are
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Effects
of extraction concentration on the extraction rate of moderately
active organic phosphorus.

The extraction rates of the two extractants gradually increased
with the increase in the extractant concentration (Figure 6). HCl solution achieved the
better extraction effect of moderately active organic phosphorus than
NaOH solution. When the extractant concentration was 1.0 mol/L, the
extraction rate of the acid method reached 47.52%, whereas the extraction
rate of the alkali method was only 36.88%. When the extractant concentration
was higher than 1.0 mol/L, the extraction rate did not increase significantly
and tended to be stable, indicating that the moderately active organic
phosphorus had been completely extracted. Therefore, the optimum extractant
concentration of the acid or alkali method was determined as 1.0 mol/L.

2.3.2 Extraction Time
Under the experimental
conditions of 20 mL of 1.0 mol/L HCl/NaOH solution as the extractant
and centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min), the effects of extraction time
on the extraction rate of moderately active organic phosphorus are
shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Effects
of extraction time on the extraction rate of moderately
active organic phosphorus: (a) HCl extractant; (b) NaOH extractant.

In the acid method, the reaction
between HCl and moderately active
organic phosphorus was faster (Figure 7a). After 3 h, the extraction rate of moderately active
organic phosphorus reached a stable value of 47.14%. In the alkali
method, the extraction rate of the moderately active organic phosphorus
was only 36.88% after 15 h (Figure 7b), indicating that the effect of moderately active
organic phosphorus in acid extraction was better than that in the
alkali method. In addition, as the extraction time increased, the
extraction rate of the acid method or the alkali method did not increase
significantly, indicating that the extraction process was completed.
Therefore, optimum extraction time was 3 h for the acid method and
15 h for the alkali method.

2.4 Residual
Residue Characterization Analysis
The residues of the alkali
method were extracted with 1.0 mol/L
H2SO4, and no inactive organic phosphorus was
detected. The residues were characterized by EDS and XRD (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Residue characterization
results: (a) EDS; (b) XRD.

The residues contained trace phosphorus (Figure 8a), indicating that phosphorus-containing
substances, which had not been completely extracted, still existed.
Phosphorus-containing substances in the residue were inorganic phosphates
(Figure 8b). Organophosphorus
was the only source of phosphorus in the system, indicating that partial
organic phosphorus was decomposed into inorganic phosphorus in the
circulating cooling system.

2.5 Effects of the Mass of
the Extracted Scale
on Total Organic Phosphorus Recovery
The total extraction
rates of organic phosphorus under different masses of the extracted
scale are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Effects of the mass of the extracted scale on total organic phosphorus
recovery.

The total extraction rates under
different masses of the extracted
scale were higher (Figure 9). Under 0.2 g of the extracted scale, the total organic phosphorus
extraction rate was significantly lower than that under 0.4 g of the
extracted scale. When the mass of the extracted scale was 0.4 g, the
extraction rate reached the highest value, 94.32%. When the mass of
the extracted scale was more than 0.4 g, the total organic phosphorus
extraction rate tended to decrease. The decrease might be interpreted
as follows. Partial organic phosphorus was covered by the excessive
scale, and the extractant could not fully contact with the internal
phosphorus in the fouling, thus resulting in incomplete extraction.
The optimum mass of the extracted scale was determined as 0.4 g.

3.3 Extraction Method Optimization
3.3.1 Active Organic Phosphorus
Scale
samples were weighed in 25 mL centrifuge tubes. Then, 20 mL of extractant
(different concentrations) was added, shaken for a certain time, and
centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 20 mL of deionized water
was added for 1 h extraction under the same conditions, and the extracts
were combined together. The total phosphorus content and inorganic
phosphorus content in the extracts were determined by ammonium molybdate
spectrophotometry. The difference between the total phosphorus content
and inorganic phosphorus content was the content of active organic
phosphorus. Three measurements were made and averaged. The extraction
rate of active organic phosphorus E1 was
determined according to eq 1.

3.3.2 Moderately Active Organic
Phosphorus
First, 20 mL of HCl or NaOH solution (different
concentrations) was
added into the above residue, shaken for a certain time, and centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. Then, 20 mL of deionized water was added for
1 h extraction under the same conditions, and the extracts were combined
together. The total phosphorus content and inorganic phosphorus content
of the extracts were determined, and the difference between the total
phosphorus content and inorganic phosphorus content was the content
of the moderately active organic phosphorus. Three measurements were
made and averaged. The extraction rate of moderately active organic
phosphorus E2 was determined according
to eq 1.

3.3.3 Inactive Organic Phosphorus/Residual Phosphorus
The
inactive organic phosphorus was not extracted by the alkali
method, indicating that the content of inactive organic phosphorus
was zero. The residues obtained after alkali extraction and burning
were extracted with 1.0 mol/L H2SO4, and then
the total phosphorus in the residue could not be detected, indicating
that the residual phosphorus content was close to zero. Therefore,
EDS and XRD were used to characterize the phosphorus form in the residues. 1  where m1 and m2 are total phosphorus mass and
inorganic phosphorus
mass in the supernatant, mg; M1 is the
total scaling mass, mg; S is the mass of the extracted
scale, mg; and M is the organic phosphorus dosage,

The total organic phosphorus extraction rate E was determined according to eq 2 2  

4 Conclusions
In this
study, the organic phosphorus extraction process and conditions
in the fouling of the circulating cooling system were optimized according
to the Ivanoff method. The optimal extraction conditions of active
organic phosphorus were determined as follows: 0.4 g of extracted
scale, 20 mL of 0.5 mol/L KHCO3 solution, and 10 h extraction.
In the extraction of moderately active organic phosphorus with the
acid method, the optimal extraction conditions were determined as
follows: 20 mL of 1.0 mol/L HCl and 3 h extraction, and the total
organic phosphorus extraction rate reached was 94.32%. In the extraction
of moderately active organic phosphorus with the alkali method, the
optimal extraction conditions were determined as follows: 20 mL of
1.0 mol/L NaOH and 15 h extraction, and the total organic phosphorus
extraction rate was 83.31%. For moderately active organic phosphorus,
the acid method realized the efficient and fast extraction, so the
acid method was the optimal extraction method for the moderately active
organic phosphorus. The organic phosphorus in the fouling mainly included
active organic phosphorus and moderately active organic phosphorus,
and there was no inactive organic phosphorus or residual phosphorus.
Therefore, the extraction process is simplified to a two-step extraction
procedure, namely active organic phosphorus extraction with KHCO3 solution and moderately active organic phosphorus extraction
with the acid method. The optimized method is characterized by the
simple operation and the good extraction effect and can be used as
a quantitative and qualitative analysis method for organic phosphorus
in the scale of the circulating cooling system.
