The
preparation of superhydrophobic textiles with high mechanical
and chemical durability is challenging. Here, facile and fluorine-free
methods, using alkali and plasma-etching treatments, followed by the
addition of silica nanoparticles and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS),
were used to prepare superhydrophobic cotton surfaces. With different
input variables and etching techniques, superhydrophobic cotton fabrics
with high chemical and mechanical durability were successfully prepared,
with contact angles up to 173°. A control of the surface architecture
at the nanoscale in combination with a homogeneous repellent layer
of TEOS in the cotton surface was achieved. The repellent properties
of the as-prepared cotton remain stable under accelerated laundering
and abrasion test conditions. The etching pretreatment by alkali or
plasma plays a key role in obtaining superhydrophobic cotton surfaces.

1 Introduction
Superhydrophobic
surfaces and coatings have received great attention
from both industrial manufacturers and scientists because of a wide
range of applications due to their anticorrosion,1−3 antiwear,4,5 antibacterial,6−11 antifungal,12−14 self-cleaning,15−20 solar-reflective21−23 and photocatalytic properties.24−31 Superhydrophobic textiles32,33 with self-cleaning
properties have been generated by making a double structure at two
different scales, characterized by the surface roughness of their
microstructures and nanostructures, covered by hydrophobic substances
on the top surface.34−36

These approaches have led to the formation
of surfaces that exhibit
large contact angles (greater than 150°) or low-contact-angle
hysteresis (lower than 10°) for use in specific applications.33,37 Water drops deposited on superhydrophobic surfaces are not absorbed,
but they move on the surface, carrying away residual matters on their
way, like dust and contaminants. Wenzel38 and Cassie–Baxter39 suggested
that hydrophobic properties are related to the presence of a microstructure
at the surface. More specifically, Cassie–Baxter’s law
considers that the water droplets form spheres and reside on the surface
of the fibrous microstructure, remaining at the top of the asperities,
forming air pockets between the water droplet and the surface.40

The incorporation of nanomaterials in
textiles can provide new
and unexpected properties such as antistaining, water repellence,
wrinkle freeness, static elimination, electrical conductivity, and
antibacterial characteristics without compromising their comfort and
flexibility.41 For water-repellent properties,
most recent approaches are mainly based on covering the textile surface
by nanoparticles42−46 followed by a chemical treatment with water-repellent agents.47 Rough surfaces have been obtained by introducing
inorganic nanoparticles such as SiO2,48 TiO2,49 and ZnO50 by the sol–gel methods. Fluorinated materials
have been coated on textile fibers due to their low surface energy
and repulsive properties to oil and water.41,51 Cotton has often been used in the manufacture of clothing fabrics
due to its characteristics including softness, comfort, flexibility,
hydrophilicity with high absorption capacity, and low cost.52 Thanks to the large number of hydroxyl groups
on its surface,53 cotton can be readily
colored and modified by physical54 and
chemical methods.55

We report, here,
facile and fluorine-free methods to prepare superhydrophobic
cotton fabrics by a dip-coating technique using chemical and physical
etching treatments of the fiber followed by the deposition of silica
nanoparticles and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). By controlling
the etching conditions and input variables, superhydrophobic cotton
fabrics were successfully prepared with contact angle values up to
173°. These fabrics display excellent resistance to chemical
and mechanical aggressors due to the covalent bonds formed between
the cotton surface and TEOS. The morphology of the as-prepared superhydrophobic
cottons was revealed by using mainly the scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (SEM–EDXA) technique. These treated cotton fabrics
exhibit improved performance compared to existing ones where either
durability or superhydrophobicity is lacking.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Wettability
Table 1 describes the conditions
of the preparation
of the samples reported in this article, whereas Figure 1 shows the corresponding water
contact angles (WCA) measurements. First, SiO2 (8 wt %)
and TEOS (10 wt %) one-step dip-coating treatment was applied to a
fabric that had not been subjected to a chemical or plasma-etching
pretreatment (but they were washed with water and ethanol). As shown
in Table 1, line a,
and Figure 1a, this
process gives a low WCA of 91°.

a Exceptionally,
solution B was prepared
in benzene instead of toluene.

Upon chemical pretreatment with NaOH, followed by dip-coating in
solution A with 8 wt % SiO2 and in solution B with 10 wt
% of TEOS, Table 1,
line b and Figure 1b, there is a jump of the WCA to 147°, indicating that etching
is required to retain sufficient SiO2 and TEOS on the fiber
to improve the hydrophobicity. Similar processes with slightly higher
amounts of SiO2 (10 and 12 wt %) (Table 1, lines c and d, and Figure 1c,d) lead to a slight improvement in WCA
of 152 and 160°, respectively.

Another experiment, Table 1, line e and Figure 1e, was developed
keeping the SiO2 concentration
at 12 wt % but increasing the TEOS concentration to 15 wt %; this
content further improves the values of WCA to a high value of 173°.
A second set of experiments was developed by etching the fabric by
plasma treatment, instead of chemicals. When keeping the SiO2 and TEOS concentrations at the same value as in Figure 1e, Table 1, line f and Figure 1f, a similar value of WCA of 173° is
obtained, indicating that the chemical and plasma treatments are equally
effective.

Finally, etching again by plasma, keeping the SiO2 and
TEOS concentrations at 12 and 15 wt %, respectively, as in the previous
case, but adding this time 2 wt % of an acrylic resin to solution
A, Table 1, line g
and Figure 1g, a small
decrease of the contact angle from 173 to 167° is observed.

These exceptionally high values of WCA, particularly under conditions
1e and 1f, can be attributed to the fact that the pretreatment of
the fiber surface by etching with NaOH solution or plasma creates
a rough microstructure. Then, a homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles
at the submicrometer level, covered by a thin layer of TEOS, leads
to the super repellent properties of the cotton fibers.

2.2 Surface Morphology and Self-Cleaning Properties
To
better understand the superhydrophobicity behavior observed
in the previous section, high-resolution SEM images were obtained
from the fiber surface. Figure 2 shows examples of the SEM images of untreated and treated
cotton fibers by different methods. It can be seen that untreated
fibers are smooth (Figure 2a). However, the etching pretreatment with sodium hydroxide
leads to an increase of the rugosity of the cotton fibers (Figure 2b) due to the extraction
of low-molecular-weight materials and lignin present in them. A similar
rough cotton surface is observed after plasma treatment (Figure 2c) due to the electron
bombardment, also leading to the removal of impurities and low-molecular-weight
species.

Figure 2 SEM images of (a) untreated cotton, (b) chemically treated cotton,
and (c) plasma-treated cotton.

The SEM images after the deposition of SiO2 nanoparticles
and repellent TEOS are shown in Figure 3. A SEM image of cotton treated by the one-step procedure
is used as a reference (Figure 3a). It can be seen that this process leads to a large number
of aggregates of SiO2 on the cotton surface. These aggregates,
with dimensions of the order of several microns, are more clearly
observed at the lower-magnification image (red arrows). Figure 3b presents the SEM image of
cotton treated with 8 wt % SiO2 nanoparticles as described
in Table 1, line b.
The increase of the nanoparticles content in solution A leads to a
higher density of nanoparticles on the cotton surface (Figure 3c–e). The pretreatment
with plasma (Figure 3f), followed by nanoparticles and TEOS depositions, also leads to
aggregates having similar density to those obtained with chemical
treatment (Figure 3e). In all cases, there is a homogeneous distribution of nanoparticles
on the fiber surface. The addition of acrylic leads to homogeneous
nanoparticles on the cotton fiber surface, and the acrylic resin can
be observed from the SEM image (Figure 3g). The chemical or plasma pretreatments create a rough
surface and, presumably, functional groups to enhance the reaction
between cotton surface and SiO2 nanoparticles.

Figure 3 SEM images
of treated cotton by the one-step (a) and two-step (b–g)
procedures. Details of the treatment conditions are shown in Table 1, i.e., pictures (a–g)
correspond to lines a–g of Table 1. Figure (a1) show an example of SiO2 agglomeration of cotton fiber treated by the one-step approach.

The semiquantitative elemental
analysis of a plasma-treated cotton
is shown in Figure 4. This figure first shows by SEM (Figure 4a) a relatively homogeneous distribution
of silicium nanoparticles on the cotton fiber surfaces, as it was
found in Figure 3a. Figure 4b, and confirmed
by elemental analysis, shows the presence of nanoparticles on the
whole fiber surface, mainly distributed at the submicrometer scale.
A separate mapping image for silicium (Figure 4c) provides a direct observation of the distribution
of this element on the treated cotton surface; SiO2 nanoparticles
are found on the whole cotton surface, and they are well distributed
without aggregation. In other words, the concentration of nanoparticles
used is suitable to form a homogeneous layer of SiO2 on
the surface of cotton.

Figure 4 NaOH-treated cotton fabric (sample e, Table 1): (a) SEM image, (b) elemental
analysis
image, and (c) silicium mapping of a cotton fiber surface.

The repellent behavior of treated cotton fabric
to different liquids
that have lower values of surface tension than pure water,56−58 including coffee, ice tea, diluted ketchup, Coca-Cola, and dyed
water, was also investigated. Figure 5a,b shows the photos of different liquids sitting on
the treated cotton surface. They have a spherical form and have not
penetrated the treated cotton structure, meaning that the cotton exhibits
a superhydrophobility not only for water but also for these liquids.
The self-cleaning properties of the cotton were verified with a natural
colorant (turmeric nanopowder): 2 g of turmeric powder was deposited
on 2 cm2 nontreated (Figure 5c) and alkali-treated cotton surfaces (Figure 5d). They were then wetted by
2 mL of distilled water drops for 30 s. In the case of untreated cotton,
the water drops are rapidly absorbed by the cotton fabric, carrying
the colorant inside the fabric structure (Figure 5e). However, in the case of the alkali-treated
cotton, the water droplets were not absorbed by the fabric, and they
carry the colorant away from the cotton surface as can be seen in Figure 5f.

deposited on a NaOH-treated cotton
surface (sample e, Table 1): (a) coffee, tea, diluted ketchup, and Coca-Cola; (b) water
+ dye (5 wt %); (c–f) photos of a natural colorant of turmeric
nanopowder deposited on an untreated cotton and alkali-treated cotton
(d). Before adding water drops in (c) and (d), the colorant is seen
sitting on the fabric; after adding water drops, in (d), it is carried
inside the fabric, whereas, in (f), it is washed away from the surface
by the nonabsorbing water.

2.3 Mechanical and Laundering Durability
For reuse purposes, treated cottons should be resistant to laundering
conditions. The laundering of the treated cottons was carried out
in hot water (60 °C) with and without detergent (2%). The subsequent
measurements of contact angles as a function of laundering times of
cotton treated with different methods are shown in Figure 6a. This figure shows that the
contact angle decreases slightly after 40 h of treatment from 173°
(±1) to 165° and from 172° (±1) to 167° with
dip-coating and plasma-treatment methods, respectively, indicating
the stability of the treatment. The sample pretreated with plasma,
followed by an acrylic resin treatment, shows a stable WCA after 40
h of laundering.

Figure 6 (a) Contact angle as a function of laundering times (2
wt % detergent,
hot water) and (b) abrasion cycles after different methods of treatments:
chemical treatment (sample e, Table 1); plasma treatment (sample f, Table 1); and plasma treatment + acrylic resin coating
(sample g, Table 1).

The mechanical durability of the
superhydrophobic coating on the
fiber surface was investigated with an abrasion test, as described
in the experimental section: the variation of the contact angle was
followed during the abrasion cycles ranging from 1 to 40 (Figure 6b). The cotton shows
a reduction of 10% of WCA after 30 abrasion cycles in the case of
alkali-treated (blue curve, Figure 6b) and plasma-treated cotton fabrics (red curve, Figure 6b). The pretreatment
of the cotton with plasma, followed by the addition of acrylic resin
(sample g, Table 1),
leads to a slightly lower WCA, but the cotton exhibits higher resistance
to abrasion compared to those without resin because their WCA value
remains unchanged after applying 30 abrasion cycles (green curve, Figure 6b).

2.4 Discussion
The contact state of a
liquid droplet on a textured surface can be described by Wenzel38 and Cassie–Baxter59 theories. In the first case, it is considered that the
structure can be wet by the liquid droplets due to their deep penetration
of the textured surface. In contrast, the Cassie–Baxter model59 supposes that there are air pockets between
the deposited liquids and the material surface, leading to a reduction
of contact area and an increase in contact angle.

Figure 7 shows the high-resolution
SEM images of the surface of cotton fibers pretreated with alkali
(Figure 7a) and plasma
(Figure 7b), followed
by the addition of dip-coated silica nanoparticles and TEOS layers.
It can be seen that both pretreatment methods lead to the formation
of rugosity surface with a large quantity of cavities (holes) (Figure 7). These holes were
found on the whole sample surface, with various dimensions ranging
from several ten to a hundred nanometer (red arrows). This structure
supports the contacting liquid droplets in the Cassie–Baxter
approach.

Figure 7 High-resolution SEM images at the surface of cotton fibers treated
by (a) NaOH (sample e, Table 1) and (b) plasma (sample f, Table 1). Red arrows show the presence of air pockets
on the surface of treated cotton fiber.

In nature, lotus leaves are repellent to liquids because
they possess
a double hierarchical structure with bumps called papillae, covered
by hydrophobic tubes at a scale of 100 nm.60 In the literature, similar artificial superhydrophobic textures
are usually obtained in two steps: the first step involves an etching
process by chemical or physical methods, followed by the addition
of layered hydrophobic compounds.

In this work, two different
approaches were used to obtain superhydrophobic
surfaces. In the first step (step 1, Figure 8), the cotton fibers were etched by chemical
or physical means. It is well known that the cotton fibers are mainly
composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and some impurities.61,62 The alkali pretreatment partially removes lignin and impurities
on the fiber surface63 and, thus, enhances
the surface rugosity (Figure 2b). The plasma etching leads to the removal of impurities
from the fiber surface, resulting in a rough surface, as shown in Figure 2c. In the second
step (step 2, Figure 8), a homogeneous deposition of silica nanoparticles by dip-coating,
followed by the addition of a layer of superhydrophobic agent (TEOS),
leads to a rough surface and water-repellent properties by creating
covalent bonds between the silane groups of TEOS and the hydroxyl
groups of the silica nanoparticles (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Schematic illustration of the preparation of
superhydrophobic cotton
fabric by alkali or plasma pretreatments.

Moreover, the used cotton fabric is formed by a large number
of
knitted fibers with dimensions of 10–20 μm (Figure 3a–g), which
are comparable with bumps on a lotus leaf at the scale of 10–20
μm.60 The choice of homogeneous and
small nanoparticles (7 nm) and suitable dip-coating conditions (concentration
of nanoparticles and immersion time) leads to a homogeneous distribution
of nanoparticles with a double hierarchical scale of textures, as
proven by SEM images (Figure 3e,f). This structure enhances the contact angle of liquid
droplets as schematically shown in Figure 9. In other words, the liquid droplets exhibit
higher apparent contact angles on a double hierarchical structure
compared with surfaces with a single scale texture56 (nontreated or treated only with nanoparticles). This is
because air is trapped at a double length scale in a hierarchical
structure, whereas it is trapped only at one length scale in the surfaces
with a single texture.56

cotton.

3 Conclusions
Superhydrophobic cotton fabrics with contact angles up to 173°
were successfully prepared using 7 nm silica nanoparticles and a silane-based
water-repellent agent, TEOS, in combination with two etching pretreatment
methods dealing with alkali and plasma approaches. This exceptionally
high value of contact angle can be explained by several reasons: (i)
the alkali and plasma pretreatments lead to a homogeneous rough surface
that enhances the hydrophobicity of the cotton fibers and (ii) the
use of ultrasmall 7 nm silica nanoparticles leads to the creation
of a double hierarchical scale on the cotton surface, which confines
the contact liquid droplet on the surface without penetration to the
cellulose substrate. The two etching methods used are equally effective.

Our finding shows that the amount of silica nanoparticles and TEOS
are key parameters that directly affect the superhydrophobility behavior
of the treated cottons and, thus, display a high resistance to both
laundering and abrasion tests. The contact angle remains stable after
30 cycles of abrasion and 40 h of washing in hot water with a detergent.
These cotton fabrics exhibit potential applications in various fields
such as oil/water filtration and functional protective clothing with
self-cleaning and repellent properties to contaminants such as chemicals
or aqueous pesticides.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials
Tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS, 98%), silica nanoparticles (7 nm in diameter), absolute ethanol,
sodium hydroxide, toluene, acetic acid, and acetone of analytical
grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. They were used as received
without further purification. A white commercial cotton fabric was
kindly provided by a local tissue store (Montreal, Canada). Acrylic
emulsions (Primal AC-261), having a solid content of 50 wt %, and
texanol (2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate) as a coalescing
agent were obtained from the Dow Chemical Company. The pink dyes were
supplied by Brother International Corp. (Canada). The natural colorant
(turmeric nanopowder) was kindly provided by the Institute of Chemistry,
Hanoi, VietNam.

All cotton samples were initially cleaned with
deionized water to remove impurities after a period of 10 min under
vacuum at 60 °C. Some of the fabrics were then immersed in a
sodium hydroxide solution (0.5 M) for 10 min for etching the cotton
surface by removing low-molecular-weight components and lignin. Alternatively,
the cotton surface can be etched using a plasma radiation (LEICA EM
ACE600) in the presence of oxygen for 20 min; a plasma power of 19
W/min was used. This leads to a rough surface and multifunctional
groups, ions, and radicals.

4.2 Preparation of Superhydrophobic
Textiles by
Dip-Coating
The cotton fabrics, previously etched with NaOH
or by plasma treatment, were dip-coated into solution A [solution
A was prepared by adding silica nanoparticles (8, 10, or 12 wt %)
to a mixture of distilled water (200 mL), ethanol (100 mL), and acetic
acid (2 mL)] at a rate of 500 μm/s for 10 min before retraction.
This process provides a uniformly thin layer of nanoparticles on both
sides of the cotton fabric (step 1). Then, the cotton fabric was submersed
in solution B for 24 h [solution B was prepared by adding 12 or 15
wt % TEOS to toluene with the Stöber et al. method64], dried, and thermally treated to create covalent
bonds between the cotton and repellent agent (step 2). In some cases,
an AC-261 acrylic resin (2 wt %) was added to solution B to improve
the adhesion and enhance the durability of the superhydrophobic cotton
surface.

4.3 Characterization
4.3.1 Contact
Angle Measurements
Contact
angle measurements were carried out on the FTA200 Dynamic Contact
Angle Analyzer at room temperature using a 10 μL water droplet.
All contact angles were measured in ten different areas of the cotton
fabric, and the reported values are averages.

4.3.2 SEM and EDXA
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7400F) was used to observe the morphology
of original and treated cotton fibers. Since the samples are not conductive,
a gold layer of 10 nm was coated on the sample surface using a LEICA
EM ACE600 sputter coater. In addition, the SEM coupled with an energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDXA) apparatus was used to characterize the distribution
of SiO2 nanoparticles on the fiber surfaces.

4.3.3 Laundering and Mechanical Stability
The stability of
the superhydrophobic fabrics to accelerate laundering
was investigated in which coated cotton samples were immersed in a
mixture solution of detergent (2 wt %) and distilled water; they were
then continuously stirred using a magnetic stirrer at a rate of 100
rpm while the temperature was maintained at 60 °C during treatment.
The samples were removed at different periods of time (10, 20, 30,
and 40 h) to measure the changes of WCA. To determine the resistance
of the superhydrophobic cottons to mechanical aggressors, abrasion
tests were carried out using a homemade device in which a 5 ×
5 cm2 treated fabric was dragged between a weight of 200
g and 180 grits sandpaper. The treated cotton was then moved at a
constant rate (0.25 cm/s) before evaluating the changes in contact
angles generated by this test. The tests were repeated 20 times, and
the reported results are averages.

fabric with only with SiO2 nanoparticles (Figure S1) shows

treatment (Figure 4b); this is because the TEOS contains also Si element (PDF)
