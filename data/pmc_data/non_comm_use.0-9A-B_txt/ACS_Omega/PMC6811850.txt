Magnetic
mesoporous CoFe2O4/SiO2 (Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2) composites
were simply synthesized. On the basis of previous studies, optimum
preparation conditions of their structure and physical properties
can be readily determined. CoFe2O4 nanocrystals
and their mesoporous structure were authenticated by low-angle and
wide-angle X-ray diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, element mapping, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and so on. They were
applied to degrade chlorpyrifos where Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites provide a mesoporous microenvironment
and combined with ultrasonic treatment can enhance heterogeneous activation
of persulfate. Research findings showed that the system can be conducive
to remove quickly chlorpyrifos and the removal ratios reached 99.99%.
The results provided a strategy for the chlorpyrifos degradation and,
similarly, pollution control of pesticide wastewater.

1 Introduction
Advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective in removal of
organophosphorus pesticides.1−3 Chlorpyrifos is one of the organophosphorus
pesticides around the world with high toxicity, persistence, and refractoriness,
causing serious harm to the waterbody environment.4−7 Therefore, the use of efficient
processes to remove this pesticide from aquatic environments is necessary.

Sulfate-radical-based AOPs (SR-AOP) were considered to possess
a similar standard reduction potential (2.5–3.1 V) as the hydroxyl
radical (·OH) (2.8 V).8,9 Persulfate,
with a high oxidative potential and wide adaptability, can overcome
the drawbacks of traditional Fenton processes, such as a narrow pH
range,10,11 excessive iron sludge,12 and intensive storage and transportation costs.13 Activation technologies are applied to strengthen
the oxidation ability of persulfate, including heating, UV irradiation,
transition metal ions, and metal oxides.14−20 Major advances and challenges in heterogeneous catalysis have been
deeply concerned.21 The research focus
was on utilization of metal, metallic oxide, and biochar to enhance
activation of peroxysulfate for PCB degradation.22−25 However, many shortcomings of
these methods have emerged, such as toxic metal leaching, poor recyclability,
and high energy consumption. Therefore, the search for activation
methods that are efficient, environmentally friendly, and economical
has attracted considerable attention.

Further, ultrasonic treatment,
as a clean, safe, and energy-saving
technology, has high potential to enhance persulfate activation for
the destruction of recalcitrant organic contaminants26 and enhance the production of free radicals (·OH and SO4–·) by providing
ultrasonic cavitation bubbles.27,28 Among the transition
metals, Co2+ is reported to be the most effective in the
activation of persulfate to generate SO4–·.29−31

In this study, a mesoporous microenvironment
was combined with
ultrasonic treatment to enhance chlorpyrifos degradation. Magnetic
CoFe2O4 nanocrystals embedded in the mesoporous
SiO2 framework were simply synthesized, creating a mesoporous
microenvironment to effectively prevent cobalt ion leakage. More specifically,
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites were
considered as promising candidates due to their high efficiency, low
cobalt leaching, and ferromagnetic nature for convenient separation
from aqueous solution. They were applied as activators of persulfate
enhanced with ultrasonic treatment for degradation of chlorpyrifos,
a typical organophosphorus pesticide. Their key parameters such as
catalyst dosage, persulfate concentration, and ultrasonic frequency
were studied.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS),
hydrochloric acid, cobalt(II) nitrate hexahydrate [Co(NO3)2·6H2O], ferric(III) nitrate nonahydrate
[Fe(NO3)3·9H2O], ethanol (CH3CH2OH), and sodium persulfate (PDS) were purchased
from Southwest Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. Triblock copolymer
F127 (EO106PO70EO106) came from J&K
Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd., China. All reagents with analytical purity
were used as received without further purification. Methanol and dichloromethane
were chromatographic purity levels from Southwest Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd., China. Simulated pesticide wastewater with chlorpyrifos
was purchased from Qingdao DuPont Chemical Group Co. Ltd., China.

2.2 Preparation and Characterization of Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites were in situ synthesized
by organic template assembly on the basis of the preliminary research.32 We made use of the following reactants: TEOS
as the silica source, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O as active
components, and F127 and octane as templates. In a typical experiment,
first, F127 and octane were dissolved in hydrochloric acid (0.5 M)
for 2 h. Second, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O were added
under stirring for 2 h. Finally, TEOS was added under stirring to
get a homogeneous mixture for 24 h at 38 °C. The molar compositions
of the mixture obtained were 1TEOS:83H2O:0.138octane:0.004F127:0.2Fe(NO3)3·9H2O:0.1Co(NO3)2·6H2O:0.75HCl. The mixture was heated by water
for 24 h at 100 °C, evaporated, and dried in a well-ventilated
space by heating. The dried powder was heated up to 550 °C at
a 10 °C·min–1 heating rate and calcined
at this temperature for 6 h. The resulting powder sample was marked
as OFE. A contrastive sample such as the magnetic nanoparticle was
marked as Fe3O4.32

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were taken on
a Tecnai F30 TEM (FEI, the Netherlands) at a 300 kV working voltage.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77
K using an AUTOSORB-1 analyzer (Contador American). Specific surface
areas were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. Pore size distribution was usually calculated from desorption
branches of nitrogen isotherms using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) model. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained at room
temperature on an X’Pert MPD pro diffractometer (Panalytical,
the Netherlands) using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5418 nm) at 40 kV and 10 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images were taken with a JEOL JSM-6700F field-emission SEM at 20 kV.
Magnetic performance was carried out using a vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM, Lakeshore 7407, America) with 20000 Oe fields and at room temperature.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi)
measurements were performed with an Al Kα source. All binding
energies were referenced to the C1s peak at 284.6 eV.

2.3 Experimental Process
Catalytic degradation
experiments were performed in a chlorpyrifos wastewater treatment
process. On the experimental stage, the catalyst was directly added
to the reactor filled with chlorpyrifos solution, stirred, and adsorbed
for 0.5–1 h. Then a certain amount of persulfate was added
to degrade chlorpyrifos. The reactor, such as a beaker, was placed
in an ultrasonic cleaner. To study the changes of various parameters,
typically, 2 g·L–1 catalyst and 4 mM sodium
persulfate were added into 200 mL of 100 mg·L–1 chlorpyrifos solution. To study the treatment effect of chlorpyrifos
wastewater with high concentration, the pH value of the solution was
adjusted. After 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 40 min intervals,
10 mL of sample was taken out. The degradation reaction between free
radical and chlorpyrifos was quenched with several drops of methanol.
Chlorpyrifos concentration was determined. The changes of various
parameters such as catalysts (0.05, 1, 2, 5, 8 g·L–1), sodium persulfate (0.5, 2, 4, 8, 14 mM), and ultrasonic frequency
(20, 40, 60, 80 kHz) were studied. To study the treatment efficiency
of the arbitrary degradation system combined with or without ultrasonic
treatment, each experiment was repeated three times. Maximum and minimum
values were recorded for each experiment. Its average values were
taken. Standard deviation was generally within the allowable range
of experimental error.

2.4 Analysis Method
Radical types were
confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR spectrometer, JES-FA200)
using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolidine-N-oxide (DMPO) as
a spin-trapping agent. The chlorpyrifos was analyzed by gas chromatograph–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS, Agilent 7890A-5975C). A C18 column (30
m × 0.25 × 0.25 μm) was employed. The carrier gas
was high-purity helium (99.999%), the flow rate is 1 mL·min–1, and C18 was infiltrated with 1 μL of methanol
and eluted with 1 μL of dichloromethane. The elution phase was
a mixture of helium/methanol or dichloromethane (20:1, v/v). Under
these conditions, the retention time of chlorpyrifos was 3 min. The
metal leakage was obtained using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS, Optima 5300DV). The concentrations of persulfate residuals
were determined by the spectrophotometric method.33 The ions released from the chlorpyrifos degradation were
determined by an ICS-5000 ion chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
America). A dual-beam ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer (UV-1900PCS,
Shanghai Spectrum Co. Ltd., China) was further used to correct the
concentration of chlorpyrifos.

and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2
HRTEM
images of OFE
are shown in Figure 1. A mesoporous structure is displayed in Figure 1A,B.34 As shown
in Figure S1, magnetic performance was
determined in which coercive force was 135828 A·m–1 of OFE and the saturation magnetization value was 8.58 emu·g–1, far below those of Fe2O3,
Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3,
and CoFe2O4.35,36 However, below
saturation magnetization will be more favorable for particles uniformly
dispersed in the solution. In Figure 2, the SEM micrograph of OFE is shown. The materials
exhibited irregular shapes. Moreover, Fe, Co, O, and Si element maps
are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S2. The active component was
uniformly dispersed and embedded in the mesoporous frameworks. Element
percentage contents are shown in Table S1.

In Figure 3, small-angle
and wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns for Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites are shown. Figure 3A exhibited one broad, relatively
weak peak, implying a mesostructured phase, which basically was in
good agreement with the three-dimensional channel shown by HRTEM images.
The crystalline phase was determined by wide-angle XRD patterns and
is displayed in Figure 3B. Eight diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 18.31, 30.13,
35.47, 36.87, 43.12, 54.11, 57.00, and 62.59°, which were indexed
to the (111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), and (440)
diffractions consistent with face-centered cubic spinel CoFe2O4 nanocrystals (space group: Fd3m, JCPDS card no. 03-0864).36 Nitrogen adsorption measurements were used to confirm cube-like
mesoporous structure characteristics of OFE.37−41 It was in good agreement with the results of transmission
electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 4, the isotherms of OFE were classified as
IV type close to the hysteresis loop between H1 and H2. It is very
consistent with Xie and Zhang.37 The pore
system was uniformly distributed with most probable pore size around
7.2 nm. The BET surface area was 331.74 m2·g–1, and the pore volume was 0.963 mL·g–1. These
results manifested that the mesoporous structure could be successfully
constructed by this method.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was one of the most powerful
tools to confirm the species and valence states of the elements on
the catalyst surface in order to understand their catalytic activity. Figure 5 shows XPS full spectra,
Fe2p, Co2p, and O1s spectra of OFE before use and after use. Si2p
and O1s spectra were attributed to the framework of the mesoporous
SiO2 in Figure 5A. Peak positions of Fe2p3/2 and Fe2p1/2 were 711.6 and 725 eV, respectively, in Figure 5B. Each peak possessed a broadened satellite
peak. Relatively weak Co2p3/2 and Co2p1/2 peaks
were observed at 781.9 and 797.7 eV in Figure 5C, respectively.42−44 The peak intensity
of OFE after use was weaker than that before use in Fe2p and O1s XPS
spectra, suggesting partial leakage of ferric oxide. The Co2p XPS
spectra implied that the extremely small Co element on the surface
was relatively stable and almost no leakage as shown in Figure 5C.

3.2 Enhanced
Activation of Persulfate by Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 with Ultrasonic Treatment
To test the chlorpyrifos
degradation mechanism, the EPR technique
was used to confirm radical types with DMPO as a spin trap agent.
DMPO can trap the free radical ·X in aqueous solution
to form the DMPO-X adduct. As shown in Figure 6, slight EPR signals were exhibited without
ultrasonic treatment. Strong characteristic signals of DMPO-OH (special
hyperfine coupling constants of αN = αH = 1.49 mT) and
DMPO-SO4 (special hyperfine coupling constants of αN
= 1.38 mT, αH = 1.02 mT, αH = 0.14 mT, αH = 0.08
mT) were observed in the EPR spectrum of 3 min of ultrasonic treatment,
suggesting that ultrasonic irradiation can activate greatly persulfate
to promote ·OH and SO4–· generation based on eqs 1 to 3.45,46 Owing to nucleophilic substitution, DMPO-SO4 adducts
transformed rapidly into DMPO-OH adducts, with the assistance of ultrasonic
treatment.47 Therefore, as shown in Figure 6, the dominant radical
of this reaction should be the hydroxyl radical. Based on the results
obtained and the literature,45,48 the mechanism based
on enhanced activation of persulfate by Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 with ultrasonic treatment to degrade chlorpyrifos
was proposed. Chief equations of reaction were as follows:46 1   2   3   4  

Figure 6 Electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectra of OFE/PDS systems

M, initial T ≈ 25 °C, initial pH ≈
7.0, ultrasonic frequency = 40 kHz.

3.3 Chlorpyrifos Degradation Performance
3.3.1 Preliminary Comparison of Various Systems
The enhanced
oxidation was studied through persulfate, Fe3O4/PDS, OFE/PDS, Fe3O4/PDS/US, and
OFE/PDS/US systems. Figure 7 illustrates the highest chlorpyrifos removal percentage of
pesticide wastewater treated by ultrasonic irradiation as a function
of reaction time in the presence of OFE/PDS/US. As it is noted, without
ultrasonic treatment, the removal percentage increased very slowly
with increasing reaction time, indicating a slower chlorpyrifos degradation
ratio. Obviously, oxidation with only OFE/PDS systems was not qualified
as a perfect removal of the chlorpyrifos from water. There was about
55.4% chlorpyrifos removal percentage when the aqueous solution was
not exposed to the ultrasonic environment after 40 min of reaction.
These results suggest that collaborative ultrasonic application could
considerably enhance the removal of chlorpyrifos in a short time.

Figure 7 Removal
profiles of chlorpyrifos on different systems enhanced
with ultrasonic treatment; [chlorpyrifos]0 = 0.285 mM, C(Fe3O4/OFE) = 2 g·L–1, [persulfate]0 = 4 mM, initial T ≈
25 °C, initial pH ≈ 7.0, ultrasonic frequency = 40 kHz.

Further, the role of Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 in the acoustic catalysis of ultrasonic irradiation
was studied.
The following mechanistic steps may describe the interactive reaction
between CoFe2O4 nanocrystal and persulfate under
the assistance of an ultrasonic field as shown in eqs 1–8. This suggests that the Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2/PDS/US process combining the synergistic
effects of acoustic cavitation and mesoporous structure showed a further
enhanced removal activity over any of the other studied AOPs and the
chlorpyrifos removal percentage reached 99.99% within 40 min of reaction.
However, chlorpyrifos removal percentage was only 55.4% in 40 min
of reaction without ultrasonic treatment, while the chlorpyrifos decomposed
percentage of the PDS/US process reached 70%. Owing to nucleophilic
substitution, DMPO-SO4 adducts transformed rapidly into
DMPO-OH adducts in OFE/PDS systems with increasing ultrasonic time
based on eq 3.44 As shown in Figure 6, moreover, ultrasonic cavitation bubbles
could enhance to generate more free radicals for oxidative cleavage
of chlorpyrifos.47,49 In other words, the ultrasonic
irradiation could also enhance the oxidation reaction by S2O42– in mesoporous cavitation where
the transformation of Co3+ to Co2+ (Fe3+ to Fe2+) (eqs 5 and 6) was increased and consequently
the generated Co2+ (Fe2+) catalyzes to produce
SO4–· radicals on eqs 1 and 2. It is clear from Figure 7 that the approximate complete removal of 100 mg·L–1 chlorpyrifos occurred by the synergistic system of
ultrasonic treatment and OFE/PDS in 40 min of reaction. 5   6   7   8  

The persulfate was activated to divide into
two circulatory systems.
The first was the ≡Fe cycle to generate free radicals on eqs 1 and 5. The second was the ≡Co cycle to produce free radicals on eqs 2 and 6. Persulfate free radicals were very active and unstable due to their
very high oxidation properties. Therefore, it has been speculated
that the persulfate radical would decompose into sulfate ions as soon
as it was formed on eq 7, with ultrasonic irradiation, so there was no such radical in the
EPR spectrum.44

Based on our experimental
removal percentages, it can be inferred
that the OFE/PDS/US system possesses the best catalytic activity for
SO4–·-AOPs. Thus, the
degradation effect of chlorpyrifos with the OFE system was higher
than that with Fe3O4. It might be due to the
composition and content in difference on the catalysis surface, also
to the mesoporous structure, specific surface area, the dispersity
of active components, and so on. Specially, the cobalt active component
produced radicals to improve the degradation efficiency of chlorpyrifos.
Finally, chlorpyrifos were effectively mineralized on eq 4.

3.3.2 Two
Key Parameters and Kinetics for Chlorpyrifos
Degradation
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 activated persulfate to remove chlorpyrifos. Removal efficiency
of chlorpyrifos in the influences of various parameters was studied. Figure 8A shows the relationship
between removal time and chlorpyrifos residual ratio in the condition
of various catalysts dosages. It was apparent that higher catalyst
dosage was favored to form more radicals in quantity for chlorpyrifos
removal.29,30 When the catalyst dosage exceeded 2 g·L–1, there was no significant change in the degradation
effect with increasing catalyst dosage. Therefore, the optimum catalyst
dosage for degradation was selected as 2 g·L–1. When the catalyst dosage was constant, the reaction system conforms
to the first-order kinetic equation: ln Ct/C0 = kt. K is the ratio constant of chlorpyrifos degradation. As shown in Figure 8B, it was a nearly
linear relationship between catalyst dosage and ratio constant Kapp of chlorpyrifos degradation. At the same
catalyst dosage, degradation ratio constant Kapp of the OFE system was larger than that of the Fe3O4 system. Figure 8C shows that higher persulfate concentration will lead to
a lower chlorpyrifos residual ratio. This could be that higher persulfate
concentration will produce more reactive oxygen species to remove
quickly the chlorpyrifos molecules. However, when the persulfate concentration
exceeded 4 mM, the chlorpyrifos removal ratio did not change significantly.
Similar to the behavior of catalyst dosage, degradation ratio constant Kps also linearly increased as persulfate concentration
was augmented for 0.5 to 14 mM in Figure 8D. The above conclusion showed that the specific
surface area, surface active species, and mesoporous structure of
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 and reactive active
species were positively correlated with the degradation efficiency
of chlorpyrifos.

persulfate concentration and reaction ratio constants (D); [chlorpyrifos]0 = 0.285 mM, initial T ≈ 25 °C,
initial pH ≈ 7.0, ultrasonic frequency = 40 kHz.

3.3.3 Effect of Ultrasonic Frequency on Chlorpyrifos
Degradation
The ultrasonic parameters related to the phenomena
of cavitation are very important factors to enhance activation systems.
Further, ultrasonic frequency is a very important factor. Therefore,
it is essential to investigate the effect of various ultrasonic frequencies
on the performance of the OFE/PDS/US system. Figure 6 shows that ultrasonic treatment can efficiently
promote persulfate activation to generate sulfate radicals and hydroxyl
radicals. As discussed in Section 3.3.1, ultrasonic treatment can also promote
chlorpyrifos molecular transfer and accelerate chlorpyrifos degradation.
Further, it can also be seen that the increase in the degradation
ratio from 20 to 40 kHz was more obvious than that from 60 to 80 kHz
in a 40 min short time, which could be that too large ultrasonic frequency
decreases chemical effects, slowly increases thermal effects, and
reduces removal potential of the chlorpyrifos, as shown in Figure 9A. The degradation
of chlorpyrifos accorded with the first-order kinetic equation. Based
on the experimental results, the ultrasonic frequency was selected
as 40 kHz, which was sufficient to remove more than 99% of chlorpyrifos
in 40 min. Figure 9B shows the maximum of the degradation ratio constant when ultrasonic
frequency was 40 kHz in OFE/PDS systems. This was due to the fact
that the cavitation generated by the ultrasonic treatment can be optimized
to activate persulfate and the formation and collapse of cavities
may generate chemical effects in extremely short timeframes (milliseconds).
The reaction ratio constant of the OFE/PDS system was greater than
that of Fe3O4/PDS systems due to chemical effects
of ultrasonic treatment in mesoporous channels and surface chemical
composition.

pH ≈ 7.0.

3.3.4 Study
on Mineralization Performance and
Degradation Mechanism
Leakage of the active component of
the catalyst directly affected the whole treatment process. As shown
in Figure 10, the
Co2+ leakage concentration was 0.001 mg·L–1 in OFE/PDS/US systems. However, in these systems, the Fe3+ leakage concentration of OFE was far lower than that of Fe3O4, and persulfate displayed higher efficiency utilization.
It may be that CoFe2O4 nanocrystals were inlaid
or embedded in the framework of mesoporous SiO2 to effectively
prevent from metal leakage, in good agreement with those of Figure 5 XPS spectra. Mesoporous
channels contributed to persulfate transfer and enhanced oxidation
ability. Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites
were reused 10 times, and the removal percentage of chlorpyrifos remained
above 90%, as shown in Figure S3. Furthermore,
metal leakages were far below the maximum allowable discharge standard
of “integrated wastewater discharge standards” (GB 8978-1996).

Figure 10 Values
of several important parameters involved in two different
systems enhanced with ultrasonic; [chlorpyrifos]0 = 0.285
mM, C(OFE/Fe3O4) = 2 g·L–1, [persulfate]0 = 4 mM, initial T ≈ 25 °C, initial pH ≈ 7.0, ultrasonic
frequency = 40 kHz.

The goal of the chlorpyrifos
degradation would complete mineralization
and nontoxicity. That was thoroughly mineralized into CO2, H2O, and inorganic ions. Chemical oxygen demand (COD)
and various ion concentrations in the OFE/PDS/US system are displayed
in Figure 11. Further,
only 92.4% COD removal ratios in the OFE/PDS/US system was higher
than 65% in the MMS/PS system.48 The active
component, mesoporous structure, and ultrasonic cavitation improved
more effectively the surface reaction to mineralize the chlorpyrifos.50,51 The concentration of various ions in the solution was determined
by ion chromatography. The results showed that organic chlorine of
chlorpyrifos was almost thoroughly transformed into chlorides and
a small amount of organic nitrogen was completely converted into ammonia
nitrogen or nitrate nitrogen. Taking predominant hydroxyl radicals
as an example, the possible degradation mechanism was elucidated.
In the OFE/PDS/US systems, the removal mechanism of chlorpyrifos might
be separated into two possible degradation pathways, as shown in Scheme 1. The first possible
degradation pathway of chlorpyrifos was α-site dechlorination
of three chlorines: the pyridine molecular fragment, attacked by hydroxyl
radicals. The diethyl thiophosphate molecular fragment, attacked by
hydroxyl radicals, was converted into the thiophosphate molecular
fragment. The second possible degradation pathway was the breakdown
of oxygen and phosphorus bonds, attacked with hydroxyl radicals, on
the pyridine ring to form three chlorpyridines and diethyl thiophosphate,
which further oxidizes into sulfur phosphoric acid. The intermediates
of these two possible degradation routes were in good agreement with
the molecular fragments of chlorpyrifos in Figure S4. That is, the chemical bond that was most likely to break
has a certain correlation with the molecular fragment in the mass
spectrometry analysis of chlorpyrifos. As shown in Scheme 1, chemical bond fission was
initiated by ·OH or SO4–·; chlorpyrifos would be decomposed into these intermediates,
further mineralizing into CO2, H2O and inorganic
ions, confirmed indirectly by the COD removal ratio and inorganic
ions generated. Especially, it was pointed out that CO can easily
react with two hydroxyl radicals to form carbonic acid, which overflows
from the system in the form of carbon oxide when carbonic acid was
in excess in the reaction system.

3.4 Discussion
From
dispersity of the
active component and ordering of the mesoporous structure, magnetic
mesoporous composite materials were prepared. First, F127, octane,
TEOS, [Fe(OH)x]n, and [Co(OH)x]n were dispersed in hydrochloric acid (0.5 M). Second, during the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic colloidization, a large amount of surface
OH– group induced [Fe(OH)x]n and [Co(OH)x]n clusters “adsorbed”
on the silicon polymer chains, which then assembled with the micelles
made of F127 and octane. Finally, the [Fe(OH)x]n and [Co(OH)x]n clusters and silicon polymer chain
were oxidized when mixed surfactant micelles were removed by calcination.
Most cobalt iron oxide was dispersedly embedded or inlaid in the silica
framework of the cubic mesoporous structure, which enhanced to activate
persulfate in ultrasonic cavitation. At the same time, the OFE/PDS/US
system could prevent metal leakage and generate a lot of SO4– and ·OH to mineralize completely
chlorpyrifos.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 composites
have been successfully synthesized for heterogeneous activation of
persulfate enhanced with ultrasonic treatment for chlorpyrifos degradation.
Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 displayed excellent
activation performance of persulfate. The chlorpyrifos degradation
ratio in the OFE/PDS/UV system was up to 99.99%. According to the
results of EPR analysis, the introduction of ultrasonic treatment
can activate persulfate to generate more free radicals than that without
ultrasonic treatment in this paper. The degradation efficiency of
chlorpyrifos was dependent on ultrasonic frequency, catalyst dosage,
and persulfate concentration. Using an ultrasonic frequency of 40
kHz, catalyst dosage of 2 g·L–1, and persulfate
concentration of 4 mM, the removal ratio of chlorpyrifos was optimized
to be 99.99%. Meso-CoFe2O4/SiO2 combined
with ultrasonic treatment showed favorable chlorpyrifos removal performance.
CoFe2O4 nanocrystals were inlaid or embedded
in the mesoporous framework to leak lower in the OFE/PDS/US system.
As shown in Figure 5 XPS, its catalytic performance remains good after repeated use.
This might make it an ideal technology for pesticide wastewater treatment.
