Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity
and have performed as powerfully predictive tools in various areas
of academic and industrious activities. In comparison, their application
in catalysis has been underdeveloped. Relying on the rapid development
of different algorithms and their implementation, it is the right
timing to harvest the potential of ML in catalysis across academy
and industry spectra. Herein, we discuss the current applications
in the field of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis by using various
ML approaches. To the best of our knowledge, modern statistical learning
techniques will be a strong tool for computational optimization and
discovery. This in turn will accurately extract the underlying mechanism
in the model that converts readily available data and precatalysts
into their promising and useful ones.

Introduction
The past decade has experienced a rapid
growth in the capability
of network and computing devices to gather, store, and transport a
huge amount of data, which is usually referred to as “Big Data”.
Regarding data mining and data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI)
is penetrating and tends to be remarkable in various fields of science
and technologies for developing a practical algorithm and software
for computer vision, language processing, image recognition, and others.
One of the most powerful strategies within AI is machine learning
(ML), which uses algorithms to learn from data, detect patterns, and
make fast and accurate prediction.1 Actually,
ML is not a new field of research in chemistry, and several seminal
studies mark the initiation of ML which can be tracked back as early
as the 1940s, but the peak in ML tools as a practical technology has
only been attained in recent years.2 The
increasing attention for the application of ML signifies its vast
acceptability and potential in resolving future scientific challenges.
Despite the growing trends of ML in various domains, its application
in the field of catalysis is still at the early stage of development.
Typically, catalysts are designed and synthesized by trial and error
with chemical intuition, which conventionally is a time-consuming
and high-cost resource. It is found that the automated machine-learning
process has been assisting in building better models, understanding
the catalytic mechanism, and providing an insight into novel catalytic
design.3,4 This has been facilitated by the development
of the latest algorithms and theory, the easy availability of experimental
data, as well as low computational cost. Herein, we discuss current
applications by using ML in the field of catalysis.

General Methods of Machine Learning
ML is an interdiscipline
field of study combining computer science,
statistics, and various subjects in data science. It is concerned
with an automated learning process which progresses over time through
decision making even under uncertainty. ML approaches can be classified
in a variety of ways based on the particular task employed for solving
practical problems. One of the wide classifications distinguishes
supervised and unsupervised learning. The different definitions between
the two methods are dependent on the type of output layer even when
used for the training model. The supervised learning method is the
most widely used ML method, and much of the practical success in deep
learning has evolved from supervised learning methods for discovering
a predictive model. According to the algorithm, the ML can be categorized
into regression and classification types, including linear regression,
artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs),
random forest, and various forms of decision tree methods.5 We chose three common methods to demonstrate
the different methodologies of ML as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram for common machine learning
methods, including
(a) linear regression, (b) artificial neural network, and (c) random
forest.

Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) is the
simplest ML method
based on the property (Y) to be modeled by a linear
combination of the descriptors (xi), as shown in Figure 1a. The advantage of linear regression is the ease of
explanation and interpretation of the modeled relationship between
independent and dependent variables. The artificial neural network
(ANN) as the name implies is a technological design to mimic the working
principle of the biological neurons in the human brain. The method
is the most popular algorithm of ML and is widely used in both regression
and classification analysis. Generally, it includes input, hidden,
and output layers as depicted in Figure 1b. Each layer consists of a certain number
of neurons, receiving a signal from the input layer, and transmits
a response in a forward direction across the different layers, with
the treatment of nonlinear activation function such as LOGSIG and
TANSIG, and finally to produce a reliable output.

Regarding
random forest (RF), the principle is on the basis of
constructing a training set and building a predictor tree that maps
out observation of a given variable to obtain accurate and stable
prediction of the target. It classifies a data point, starting from
the top of the tree to different branches down through the several
nodes and reaching the terminal leaf, as the decision flow in green
color is depicted in Figure 1c. RF is easier to interpret relative to ANN due to its simplicity
and clarity. In addition, they give more insights into the relative
importance of descriptors on how they influence the target.

In addition, different ML methods have their corresponding advantages
and disadvantages, and the selection of an individual method depends
on the size and feature of the database. Generally speaking, for a
small data set, the linear regression and classification methods can
handle such tasks, including Logistic and Naive Bayes methods. On
the other hand, for the big data set, the nonlinear method is preferable,
such as ANN and K nearest-neighbor (KNN) methods. To begin with the
ANN method, huge data usually yield better model performance due to
its easy learning approach. Furthermore, there are also some methods
that can be used for both linear and nonlinear analysis, such as SVM,
which is easier to interpret than ANN, but its disadvantange is sensitivity
to the selection of parameters and functions. If the database lost
the attribute value and there is no correlation for characteristics,
the decision tree may be a better consideration, while it tends toward
overfitting compared with that of RF. Regarding unsupervised learning,
clustering is the most common technique, and the K-means method is
a good choice, which is simple and fast to deal with the big data
set to find a hidden pattern in unlabeled data.

Although the
early studies by ML were reported more than half a
century ago, important applications of ML techniques have been reached
just in the past several years in different branches of chemistry
science, such as organic and inorganic chemistry.6−8 As far as the
field of catalysis is concerned, ML is making an impact on homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysis research.

Applications of ML in Homogeneous Catalysis
In terms
of homogeneous catalysts, most of the reported studies
apply linear regression analysis to establish the quantitative relationship
between the structural descriptors and catalytic activity and/or other
properties. For example, a multiple linear regression algorithm was
applied to predict the catalytic activity of different analogues of
bis(arylimino)pyridine metal complexes.9 Seven descriptors were extracted from the electronic and steric
effects, including the Hammett constant, effective net charge, HOMO–LUMO
energy gap, energy difference, open core angle, and bite angle. Different
combinations of descriptors were tried to get better fitting results
by using as few descriptors as possible. The results revealed that
the combination of effective net charge and bite angle shows correlation
coefficient values over 0.9 for both Fe and Co analogue systems, and
the variation of catalytic activity is mainly determined by the effective
net charge.

There have been a small number of reports of quantitative
structure–activity/properties
relationship (QSA/PR) studies of olefin polymerization using metallocene
catalysts by Cruz and co-workers. They investigated the polymerization
activity and molecular weight of the resulting polyethylenes for a
series of biscyclopentadienyl Zr(IV), bisdimethylsilane-indenyl Zr(IV),
bisindenylHf(IV) metallocene, and bis(imino)pyridine iron complex
catalyst systems, respectively.10 The results
illustrate that the catalytic activities are affected by the charge
distribution around the aromatic ligands and the steric hindrance
around the active site; meanwhile, the steric effect during the reaction
of monomer insertion influences the molecular weight of the product.
Recently, both 2D- and 3D-QSPR modeling were utilized to analyze various
catalytic performances of a data set of 55 bis(imino)pyridine Fe/Co
complexes as shown in Scheme 1A, including the catalytic activity, molecular weight, and
melting temperature of the product.11 The
results revealed that the descriptors favorable to catalytic activity
are unfavorable to the molecular weight of product. This may explain
the reason why the high activity hardly exists with high molecular
weight, at the same time regarding the catalytic performance of one
catalyst.

Scheme 1 Structures for the Catalysts of (A) Bis(imino)pyridine
Fe/Co Complexes,
(B) Cycloalkyl-Fused Bis(arylimino)pyridine Metal Complexes, and (C)
Suzuki–Miyaura C–C Cross-Coupling in References (11−13), Respectively
Furthermore, the catalytic performance of cycloalkyl-fused
bis(arylimino)pyridine
metal precatalysts toward ethylene polymerization is investigated
to explain the effect of different sizes of fused rings.12 The size of fused member rings is changed from
five to seven, as listed in Scheme 1B. It is found that the number of aromatic bonds in
the complex accounts for over 50% of catalytic activity, indicating
that in addition to the ring strain the degree of conjugation in the
complex is the main responsibility for the catalytic activity. This
work illustrates the mechanism of the higher catalytic activities
by seven-membered fused-ring Fe derivatives compared with that of
six-membered fused-ring analogues.

Although the data set for
organometallic catalysts (∼50)
in the latest studies is comparably increased, it is still relatively
small. Therefore, all the reports mentioned above were conducted by
the linear regression analysis method. The linear relationship between
each descriptor and the properties of interest, which characterize
the linear fitting model, makes it meritorious for a clear relationship
and easy interpretation. However, if more accurate quantitative prediction
was necessary, a larger data set for training would be desirable.
Unfortunately, homogeneous catalysis studies usually involve small-scale
batch experiments. Each individual reaction is an independent experiment
and not directly related to others. Particularly for organometallic
catalysis, experimental studies on catalytic reactions are time-consuming
and require a large amount of resources; therefore, it is a great
challenge to build the big data set from the kinetic studies. Furthermore,
the catalytic properties are influenced by too many experimental reaction
variables.

Cross-coupling reactions have also been the subject
of several
studies. Lilienfeld and Corminboeuf applied kernel ridge regression
machine learning models to predict the energy of the oxidative addition
process for organometallic catalysts for Suzuki–Miyaura C–C
cross-coupling reactions indicated as reaction 1 in Scheme 2.13 The huge library of catalysts was comprised of the different combinations
of 6 metals and 90 ligands, as indicated in Scheme 1C. The energy values can be used as a descriptor
to estimate the activity of catalysts via molecular volcano plots,
which were obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculation
instead of experiments. The trained ML models were subsequently exploited
to predict the energy-based descriptor of 18 062 potential
out-of-sample catalysts with negligible computational cost. More importantly,
Dreher and Doyle reported the ML work on 4600 palladium-catalyzed
Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling reactions as shown in reaction
2, which were obtained via high-throughput experimentation, in order
to predict the performance of the synthetic reaction in multidimensional
chemical space.14 The atomic, molecular,
and vibrational descriptors were computed and extracted as input variables.
By contrast, a random forest algorithm and a single-layer neural network
provide significantly improved predictive performance for predicting
the reaction yield over linear regression analysis, support vector
machines, and k-nearest neighbors. By evaluating
the relative importance of descriptors, the proposed resource of deleterious
side reactivity was verified by further experiments, suggesting its
value in facilitating the adoption of synthetic methodology.

Scheme 2 Catalytic
Reactions for Cross-Coupling in References (13) and (14) and Regio-/Enantioselectivities
in References (15) and (16), Respectively
How to predict and control various forms of
selectivities, such
as enantio- and/or regioselectivities, has been a long-term goal in
chemical catalysis. For the regioselective difluorination catalytic
reaction of alkenes as reaction 3, Sunoj investigated the reaction
outcome by using various ML tools.15 The
neural networks accurately predicted the different difluorinated product.
The chemical insights were deciphered by a combination of decision
tree and the random forest for more rational choices of the reactant
alkene for the desired regioisomeric product. Sigman and co-workers
presented a holistic, data-driven workflow for deriving statistical
models by the linear regression algorithm of one set of enantioselectivity
reactions in asymmetric catalysis.16 The
reaction of BINOL-based phosphoric-acid-catalyzed nucleophilic additions
to imines was chosen as a general reaction as indicated in reaction
4. The obtained linear fitting models revealed the general interactions
that impart asymmetric induction and allow the quantitative transfer
of this information to new reaction components.

Applications of ML in Heterogeneous Catalysis
In contrast
to homogeneous catalysis, heterogeneous catalysis involves
the interaction of a molecule with a substrate, giving heterogeneous
catalysis unique features. In heterogeneous catalysis, the data set
is generally generated from continuous operation. This provides the
chance for the variation of a limited number of parameters and makes
it easier to directly generate a huge data set. Therefore, there are
more reports in the field of heterogeneous catalysis compared with
that of homogeneous catalysis.17,18 The combination of
ML with quantum mechanics (QM) calculations has aided researchers
to accelerate the discovery of catalyst candidates in combinatorial
big spaces, such as bimetallic alloys. Bimetallic catalysts are good
candidates for the most complicated thermal and electrochemical reactions,
but modeling the diverse active sites on polycrystalline samples is
a topic of discussion. Undoubtedly, high-level quantum-chemical calculations
can be used to accurately obtain reactivity descriptors, but the expensive
computational cost is its limitation. The ML method, on the contrary,
provides an alternate pathway to model the reactivity of catalysts
on the basis of the correlations between structural descriptors and
reactivity properties.

For example, Xin reported a holistic
machine-learning framework
for rapid screening of bimetallic catalysts toward methanol electro-oxidation.19 The adsorption energies of *CO and *OH on {111}-terminated
metal surfaces and fingerprint features of active sites were used
as the output and input variables, which were calculated from density
functional theory calculations. For around 1000 idealized alloy surfaces,
the trained ML models show good predictive power in exploring the
immense chemical space of bimetallic catalysts. Hundreds of possible
active sites exist for every stable low-index facet of a bimetallic
crystal. In order to systematically search for the active sites, Nørskov
utilized a new approach using ML neural network potentials to model
the nickel gallium bimetallic surface for the electrochemical reduction
of CO2, as illustrated in Figure 2.20 The estimated
results of activity by ML was present with an order of magnitude fewer
explicit DFT calculations. The results show that the most promising
active site motifs are isolated nickel atoms with surrounding gallium
atoms, rationalized by recent experimental reports of nickel gallium
activity.

and predict adsorption energies for small molecules. The local region
around each atom is used to generate a geometric fingerprint, which
is fed through a neural network to provide an atomic contribution
to the adsorption energy. The predicted adsorption energy is a summation
over these atomic contributions. Reprinted with permission from reference (20). Copyright 2017 American

Furthermore, Jinnouchi used a ML-based Bayesian
linear regression
method to predict the direct decomposition of NO on the Rh Au alloy
nanoparticles (NPs) using a local similarity kernel, which allows
interrogation of catalytic activities based on local atomic configurations,
as shown in Figure 3. The proposed method can efficiently predict the binding energies
of atoms and molecules with the NPs and formation energies of NPs
using DFT data on single crystals.21

and composition-dependent catalytic activities. Reprinted with permission

Later, Rappe investigated the catalytic activity
of the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) on Ni2P(0001) nanoclusters as
a function of diverse adsorption site structures.22 The influence of surface nonmetal doping, as shown in Figure 4A, on the surface
structure, charge states, and HER activity, was calculated by DFT.
The regularized random forest machine learning algorithm was used
to discover the relative importance of structure and charge descriptors,
indicating the robust descriptor of the Ni–Ni bond length in
determining the HER activity of Ni2P(0001) as in Figure 4B.

Ni3P2(0001) surface
of Ni2P showing the () R30° supercell.
The Ni3-hollow sites, which bind H, are shown. The indices
on P atoms indicate the preferred sequence of substitution with dopants.
(B) The discovered Ni–Ni bond length is the most important
descriptor of HER activity, which suggests that the nonmetal dopants
induce a chemical pressure-like effect on the Ni3-hollow
site, changing its reactivity through compression and expansion. Reprinted

Activation energy is an important index for understanding
how a
chemical reaction would proceed and behave. ML is employed to find
the underlying variation trends and regularity within multidimensional
space in order to detect the key descriptors for the activation energy.
Takahashi estimated the activation energies for a data set of 788
catalytic reactions constructed using first-principle calculations
with the implementation of ML. Activation energy can be instantly
predicted by chosen descriptors with over 90% accuracy using various
methods, such as linear regression, random forest, and support vector
machine.23 Nøskov applied both the
linear and nonlinear regression machine method to investigate the
reaction barrier of 315 dissociation reactions of an assortment of
molecules on a variety of surfaces.24 The
results indicated that the accuracy can be improved up to 2∼3
orders of magnitude by adding up to 7 additional descriptors beyond
the traditionally used descriptor reaction energy.

In addition
to the reaction properties, the reaction conditions
play a crucial role in most reaction optimization studies, while rational
solvent selection remains a significant challenge in process development.
By using the Gaussian process surrogate model ML on a library of 459
solvents for Rh(CO)2(acac)/Josiphos-catalyzed asymmetric
hydrogenation, Lapkin demonstrated that it is possible to treat them
algorithmically without resorting to expensive high-throughput experimentation.25 The promising solvents had better reaction outcomes.
Additionally, the composition of solvent mixtures and optimal reaction
temperature were found using a black-box Bayesian optimization.

Conclusions
The application of machine learning (ML)
has seen a rapid explosion
in recent years. Despite its huge success in other fields, ML remains
a young field particularly in catalysis with many underexplored research
opportunities. This mini-review provides a platform for an integrated
ML technique toward design and development in the area of homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysis, which is expected to shake the paradigm
of catalysis by lowering the cost associated with the initial discovery.
With the progressive increase in number of applications, we anticipate
the method to accelerate dramatically in the near future and become
the hallmark of a high-level computational tool in the catalytic community.
