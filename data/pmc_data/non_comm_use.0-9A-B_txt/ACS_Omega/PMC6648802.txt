Rhodium
(Rh) is the most expensive platinum group metal (PGM) and
is of great industrial importance. Although the recycling of PGMs
from secondary sources is in high demand, the preferential and selective
separation of Rh from PGM mixtures remains a great challenge. Here,
a selective Rh separation method involving the precipitation of Rh
from an HCl solution containing palladium (Pd), platinum (Pt), and
Rh is reported. 4-Butylaniline and 4-hexylaniline were used as precipitants
for Rh, and selective Rh precipitation was achieved at high HCl concentrations.
We revealed that Rh in HCl selectively forms a unique and highly stable
ion-pair complex comprising [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio. The formation and high
stability of the Rh complex were found to play important roles in
the selective recovery of Rh from PGM mixtures.

Introduction
Platinum
group metals (PGMs) are industrially important elements
because of their extensive use in electrical devices, dental materials,
catalysts, and jewelry.1,2 Currently, rhodium (Rh) is the
most expensive of the PGMs and is mainly used in automobile catalysts
alongside palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt).3−5 The recycling
of PGMs from secondary sources, such as waste streams or postconsumer
scrap, is essential because of their high cost and scarcity, and besides
these factors, the selective and preferential recovery of Rh from
PGM mixtures is desirable in terms of economic efficiency.

Solvent
extraction methods have been widely applied in the separation
and recovery of PGMs from metal-containing aqueous solutions.6−10 For example, Pd(II) and Pt(IV) can be extracted from hydrochloric
acid (HCl) solutions using di-n-hexyl sulfide11 and tri-n-butyl phosphate12 as extractants, respectively. However, there
have been no practical Rh extraction methods reported to date, meaning
that Rh is recovered from raffinate after solvent extraction, even
in widely used industrial processes, such as the process used by Vale’s
refinery in Acton in the United Kingdom.13 The difficulty in Rh extraction can be explained in the context
of the extractability of PGMs, which can be performed via two different
extraction mechanisms: ligand–metal coordination and ion-pair
formation.14 The order of the ligand–metal
mechanism extractability of the PGMs has been reported to be Pd(II)
≫ Rh(III) ≫ Pt(IV), and Rh(III) and Pt(IV) are regarded
to be kinetically inert.15 In the case
of the ion-pair mechanism, the order of extractability of PGM chloro-complexes
formed in aqueous HCl solutions is [MCl4]2– ≅ [MCl6]2– > [MCl6]3– > aqua species (such as [MCl4(H2O)2]− and [MCl5(H2O)]2–).16 [RhCl6]3– and aqua chloro-complexes
of Rh are
nearly impossible to extract via the ion-pair mechanism, even though
chloro-complexes of Pd(II) and Pt(IV), such as [PdCl4]2– and [PtCl6]2–, can be
easily extracted in this way. Although several Rh extractants have
been reported, the reported extraction methods for Rh also involve
the coextraction of Pd and Pt.17,18 The precipitation approaches
to separation and recovery of PGMs have been also reported. The separation
of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) has been achieved by selective precipitation
via ligand–metal coordination19 or
ion-pair formation.20 However, the selective
precipitation of Rh(III) has not been achieved yet. Therefore, the
preferential and selective separation of Rh remains one of the most
challenging issues in the recycling of PGMs.21 However, it cannot be achieved with conventional extension technology.

Herein, a new Rh separation method involving the preferential precipitation
and selective separation of Rh(III) from HCl solutions containing
Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) using 4-alkylanilines is described. We
developed a new strategy for Rh-selective separation based on the
formation of a unique and highly stable ion-pair complex comprising
[RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in
a 1:6:3 ratio.

Results and Discussion
Precipitation Behavior
of Rh(III)
An overview of the
metal separation experiments is shown in Figure 1. The precipitant, 4-butylaniline or 4-hexylaniline,
was added to HCl solutions containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III)
(1.0 mmol/L each), and then the mixtures were vigorously shaken. The
precipitates formed in the mixtures were separated by centrifugation,
and the percentages of the metals in the precipitates were evaluated
by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES)
of the supernatant. Figure 2a,b shows the relationship between the metal precipitation
percentages and the HCl concentrations. 4-Butylaniline was hardly
able to precipitate Pd and Pt (<10%) in a wide range of HCl concentrations
(1–8 M). On the other hand, it was observed that Rh was successfully
precipitated and that the Rh precipitation percentages increased upon
an increase in the HCl concentration. 4-Hexylaniline was also used
as a metal precipitant. Most of Pd and Pt (>90%) were precipitated
using 4-hexylaniline in 1–2 M HCl, and their precipitation
percentages were found to drastically decrease upon an increase in
the HCl concentration. In contrast, over 85% of Rh in the solutions
was precipitated at high HCl concentrations (3–8 M). As a result,
a high Rh precipitation of over 85% and a high Rh selectivity (the
Pd and Pt precipitation was <5%) were achieved at high HCl concentrations
(6–8 M) using either 4-butylaniline or 4-hexylaniline as the
precipitant. As shown in Figure 1, the resulting precipitate in 8 M HCl has a pinkish
color, which corresponds to the color of the HCl solution of Rh(III).

Figure 1 Scheme
of the experiments on Rh precipitation from HCl solutions
containing Pd, Pt, and Rh. The photographs show the procedure under
the following experimental conditions: 8 M HCl, 4-butylaniline/Rh
molar ratio of 30:1, and 3 h of shaking.

shaking time on the metal precipitation using 4-hexylaniline (8 M

In order to optimize the Rh precipitation conditions, metal
precipitation
experiments using 8 M HCl solutions were performed by changing the
loading amounts of 4-alkylanilines used and the shaking time. The
precipitation percentages of Rh after 3 h of shaking were observed
to increase upon an increase in the 4-alkylaniline loading and reached
a plateau at 4-butylaniline/Rh and 4-hexylaniline/Rh molar ratios
of 20:1 and 9:1, respectively (see Figures 2c and S1 in the Supporting Information). In contrast, the precipitation percentages of
Pd and Pt were found to be consistently below 5%, even at a high 4-alkylaniline/Rh
molar ratio of 50:1. The optimized ratio of 4-alkylaniline/Rh for
the Rh precipitation seems to depend on the hydrophobicity of 4-alkylanilines;
the use of a smaller amount of 4-hexylaniline than 4-butylaniline
results in the precipitation of more Rh. The effect of the shaking
time on the metal precipitation was also investigated under the conditions
with a 4-hexylaniline/Rh molar ratio of 30:1 in 8 M HCl (Figure 2d). The Rh precipitation
was completed after just 10 min of shaking. Furthermore, the composition
of the precipitated metals remained unaltered and was found to be
independent of the shaking time.

Characterization of the
Rh-Containing Precipitate
To
elucidate the structure of the Rh-containing precipitate, single-crystal
X-ray structure analysis was performed. Single crystals were prepared
by the slow evaporation of a 1 M HCl solution of the precipitate prepared
from a Rh-containing 8 M HCl and 4-hexylaniline solution. The structure
determination revealed that six anilinium cations surround each Rh
chloro-complex anion ([RhCl6]3–) and
three chloride anions coexist to balance the total charge (see Figure 3a,b and the Supporting Information). Each anilinium cation
faces a triangular face of the [RhCl6]3– octahedron, and the distance between each anilinium cation and central
Rh atom is almost constant at Rh···N 3.99–4.04
Å. In other words, one [RhCl6]3– complex anion forms an ion-pair complex with six anilinium cations
and three chloride anions. This result was not anticipated, as the
trivalent [RhCl6]3– anion is generally
expected to form an ion-pair complex with three anilinium cations
in terms of charge balance. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first report on unique ion-pair formation between Rh, anilinium,
and chloride ions in the form of [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio.

(c) Chemical structure based on the single-crystal structure of the
Rh-containing precipitate with 4-hexylaniline.

In order to determine whether the structure of the bulk Rh-containing
precipitate was the same as its single-crystal structure or not, powder
X-ray diffraction measurements were performed in the 2θ range
of 5°–25° on a pristine precipitate prepared from
8 M HCl using 4-hexylaniline. As shown in Figure 4a, all of the peaks present in the measured
patterns closely match the simulated pattern generated from the single-crystal
diffraction data. This result indicates that the bulk pristine precipitate
is made up of aggregated microcrystals comprising [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio. The
formation of the 1:6:3 complex in the bulk precipitate was further
supported by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopic (XPS) analysis.

under an air flow of 200 mL/min. (c) XPS spectrum of the Rh-containing
precipitate prepared from 8 M HCl using 4-hexylaniline.

In the TGA, a weight loss was observed in the range
of 150–480
°C because of the decomposition and volatilization of 4-hexylaniline
and chlorine, and the amount of ash at 750 °C was found to be
8.6% (Figure 4b). It
is known that the combustion of RhCl3 in an oxidative atmosphere
yields Rh2O3 below a temperature of 900 °C.22 The expected weight fraction of Rh2O3 after combustion of the 1:6:3 complex was calculated
to be 8.5%, which corresponds to the actual weight residue of the
pristine precipitate measured.

XPS measurement was performed
on the pristine precipitate, and
the XPS spectrum was found to exhibit N 1s, Rh 3d, C 1s, Cl 2s, and
Cl 2p signals, indicating that the precipitate is a complex made up
of Rh and 4-hexylaniline (Figure 4c). The N/Cl/Rh atomic ratio calculated from the XPS
peaks was 6.1:8.8:1.0, which confirmed that the Rh-containing precipitate
comprises one [RhCl6]3– complex ion,
six anilinium cations, and three chloride ions, in good agreement
with the results of the powder X-ray diffraction measurements. The
elemental analysis result of the pristine precipitate was also found
to support the formation of a 1:6:3 complex (Table 1). It is noteworthy that the same unique
complex with the same ratio of ions also formed when 4-butylaniline
was used as the precipitant (see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This means that various aromatic
primary amines have possibilities of working as Rh precipitants based
on the formation of the unique Rh complexes.

Effect of the Structure of Rh Chloro-Complex
Anions
It is well-known that Rh(III) forms chloro-complex
anions such as
[RhCl4(H2O)2]−,
[RhCl5(H2O)]2–, and [RhCl6]3– in HCl solutions and that their compositions
change according to the HCl concentration used.21,23 The distribution of Rh chloro-complex anions in various HCl concentrations
was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy (Figures 5 and S3 in the Supporting Information).23,24 The predominant specie in high
HCl concentrations was found to be [RhCl6]3–, whereas the amount of [RhCl5(H2O)]2– present in the solution was observed to increase upon a decrease
in the HCl concentration, until it became the major component of the
solution at low HCl concentrations.

Figure 5 Distribution of Rh chloro-complex anions
at different HCl concentrations
determined by UV–vis spectroscopy.

As previously mentioned, the Rh-containing precipitate prepared
from 8 M HCl formed a 1:6:3 complex of [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions. In order to examine the structure of the
Rh-containing precipitate prepared from low-concentration HCl solutions,
where [RhCl5(H2O)]2– is the
major component, powder X-ray diffraction, TG, and XPS measurements
were performed on the precipitate prepared from 2 M HCl using 4-hexylaniline.
All of the obtained results, the diffraction patterns, the amount
of weight residue, and the atomic ratio, were found to correspond
to those of the precipitate from the 8 M HCl solution, indicating
that the precipitate obtained from the 2 M HCl solution also has an
ion-pair complex structure comprising [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). On the basis of the
above results, it was concluded that 4-alkylanilines selectively precipitate
[RhCl6]3– by forming an ion-pair complex,
regardless of the HCl concentration used.

Figure 6a shows
the composition of [RhCl6]3– determined
by UV–vis spectroscopy and the precipitation percentages of
Rh using 4-hexylaniline at different HCl concentrations. As shown
in Figure 6a, the precipitation
percentages of Rh exceed the abundance ratio of [RhCl6]3– at low HCl concentrations, even though only [RhCl6]3– can form a precipitate. The influence
of the shaking time on the Rh precipitation from 2 and 8 M HCl using
4-hexylaniline was examined, and the results are shown in Figure 6b. The Rh precipitation
from the 8 M HCl solution was completed after a mere 10 min of shaking.
On the other hand, the precipitation percentages of Rh from the 2
M HCl solution were found to gradually increase upon an increase in
the shaking time and reached 78% after 24 h of shaking, despite the
composition ratio of [RhCl6]3– in 2 M
HCl being only 7.5%. This precipitation behavior from 2 M HCl is considered
to be the result of an equilibrium shift from [RhCl4(H2O)2]− and [RhCl5(H2O)]2– to [RhCl6]3–.

time on metal precipitation using 4-hexylaniline (4-hexylaniline/Rh
molar ratio of 30:1).

Mechanism of Selective Precipitation of Rh(III)
It
is widely recognized that Rh(III) in HCl cannot be extracted using
conventional solvent extraction methods15,16 and that the
extremely low extractability of Rh(III) via the ion-pair mechanism
is considered to be due to the large hydration shell of [RhCl6]3–.25 Generally,
conventional extractants, containing secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
ammonium cations, show hydrophobic behavior because the hydrophilic
ammonium cations are generally surrounded by hydrophobic aromatic
rings or long alkyl chains.6−12 As a consequence, they cannot overcome the large hydration shell
of [RhCl6]3–, resulting in the failure
to form an ion pair. 4-Alkylanilines used in this study are primary
amines and show amphiphilic behavior. The successful ion-pair formation
of 4-alkylanilines and [RhCl6]3– is considered
to be due to the primary ammonium cation being hydrophilic enough
to overcome the large hydration shell of [RhCl6]3–.

The selective precipitation of Rh from HCl solutions containing
Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) was achieved and was found to be particularly
successful at high HCl concentrations. In our previous work, it was
found that chloro-complexes of Pd(II) and Pt(IV), such as [PdCl4]2– and [PtCl6]2–, and primary aromatic amines can form ion pairs comprising one chloro-complex
anion and two anilinium cations.20,26 Although ion
pairs of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) were precipitated using 4-hexylaniline
below 6 M HCl concentrations, no precipitation of these metals was
observed at high HCl concentrations. This fact indicates that Pd(II)
and Pt(IV)/4-alkylaniline ion pairs are not stable in high concentrations
of HCl, which is a result of the anilinium cations in the ion pairs
being exchanged with protons from HCl, leading to Pd(II) and Pt(IV)
being dissolved in the HCl solution. In fact, the Pd(II) and Pt(IV)
precipitates prepared from 2 M HCl using 4-hexylaniline were completely
dissolved in 8 M HCl (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). In contrast, Rh(III) was precipitated using 4-alkylanilines
at high HCl concentrations, indicating that Rh/4-alkylaniline ion
pairs are stable even in high HCl concentrations. Consequently, the
preferential and selective precipitation of Rh was successfully achieved
based on the unique Rh-containing ion-pair structure that results
in peculiar high stability of the Rh/4-alkylaniline ion pairs in high
HCl concentrations. It is worth noting that our strategy concept for
Rh-selective separation based on the formation of a unique and highly
stable ion-pair complex has the possibility of the selective recovery
of industrially important Ru(III) and Ir(III) from the other PGMs
because the structures of chloro-complexes of Ru(III) and Ir(III),
[RuCl6]3– and [IrCl6]3–, are similar to that of [RhCl6]3–.14,15 The investigation of applicable metals and
amines as well as the detailed analysis on the stability of the ion-pair
complexes is still in progress.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a new way of separating Rh from the HCl solutions
containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) based on the preferential and
selective precipitation of Rh(III) using 4-alkylanilines has been
developed. Selective Rh precipitation was achieved at high HCl concentrations
using either 4-butylaniline or 4-hexylaniline. Structural analysis
of the resulting Rh-containing precipitates revealed the formation
of a unique ion-pair complex comprising [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio. Rh-selective precipitation
at high HCl concentrations is due to the unusual high stability of
Rh/4-alkylaniline ion pairs. It is hoped that this method will be
promising for use in practical Rh recovery processes and will open
up the field of PGM recycling.

Materials and Methods
Materials
4-Butylaniline
and 4-hexylaniline were purchased
from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. and used as received. Pd(II) and
Pt(IV) standard solutions (1000 ppm in 1 M HCl) were purchased from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Rh(III) standard solution (1000
ppm in 1 M HCl) was purchased from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.

Metal
Precipitation Experiments Using 4-Butylaniline and 4-Hexylaniline
To HCl solutions (1 mL) containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III)
(1.0 mmol/L each) were added 4-butylaniline or 4-hexylaniline, and
the mixtures were vigorously shaken at room temperature. The resulting
solid was separated by centrifugation (7200g, 10
min), and the metal concentration in the supernatant was determined
by ICP–AES. The metal precipitation experiments were carried
out by varying the concentration of HCl, the amount of precipitating
agents, and the shaking time.

Isolation of the Rh-Containing
Precipitate
To a HCl
solution (2 or 8 M, 10 mL) containing Rh(III) (2.0 mmol/L) was added
4-hexylaniline (35 mg, 0.2 mmol) or 4-butylaniline (30 mg, 0.2 mmol),
and the mixture was vigorously shaken for 3 h at room temperature.
The resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed five times
with a 3 M HCl solution. The solid was dried at room temperature for
48 h under vacuum.

Preparation of a Single Crystal
The Rh-containing precipitate
(10 mg) prepared from 8 M HCl using 4-hexylaniline was dissolved in
1 M HCl (ca. 50 mL), and the resulting solution was left to stand
for 1 month. The single crystal was obtained as a red-colored crystal.

Measurements
The metal concentrations were measured
on an ICP–AES instrument (SPS5510, SII Nanotechnology Inc.).
XPS measurements were conducted on an AXIS-Ultra X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd.). The relative sensitivity factors
supplied with the instrument control software were used for element
quantification (N 1s: 0.477, Cl 2s: 0.493, Rh 3d: 4.822). UV–vis
absorption spectra were collected using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Model V-550, Jasco co., Tokyo, Japan). TGA measurements were carried
out using a STA7300 (Hitachi High-Tech Science Co., Tokyo, Japan)
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under air flow (200 mL/min). The
powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out with a Rigaku
Ultima IV. Elemental analysis was conducted on an elemental analyzer
(CE-440M, Exeter Analytical Inc., North Chelmsford, MA). The single-crystal
X-ray diffraction data were collected using a Rigaku Saturn 724 charge-coupled
device (CCD) diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ =
0.71075 Å). The crystal data and structure refinement are listed
in Table S1. Data collection, cell refinement,
and data reduction were conducted using the CrysAlisPro software.27 The structure was solved by direct methods using
the program SHELXT28 and refined by full-matrix
least-squares methods on F2 using SHELXL2014.29 All materials for publication were prepared by Yadokari-XG 2009
software.30 Tables of positional and thermal
