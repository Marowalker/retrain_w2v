Because
of high crystallinity and natural abundance, the crystal
structures of the native cellulose allomorphs have been theoretically
investigated to elucidate the cellulose chain packing schemes. Here,
we report systematic structure optimization of cellulose chain sheet
models isolated from the cellulose Iα and Iβ crystals
by density functional theory (DFT). For each allomorph, the three-dimensional
chain packing structure was partitioned along each of the three main
crystal planes to construct either a flat chain sheet model or two
stacked chain sheet models, each consisting of four cello-octamers.
Various combinations of the basis set and DFT functional were investigated.
The flat chain sheet models constituting the cellulose Iα (110)
and Iβ (100) planes, where the cellulose chains are mainly linked
by intermolecular hydrogen bonds, exhibit a right-handed twist. More
uniform and symmetrical sheet twists are observed when the flat chain
sheet models are optimized using a basis set with diffuse functions
(6-31+G(d,p)). The intermolecular interactions are more stable when
the chain sheet models are optimized with the two hybrid functionals
CAM-B3LYP and M06-2X. Optimization of the two stacked chain sheet
models, where van der Waals interactions predominated between adjacent
chains, gave differing results; those retaining the initial structures
and those losing the sheet appearance, corresponding to the cellulose
Iα/Iβ (010)/(11̅0) and (100)/(110) chain sheet models,
respectively. The cellulose Iβ (11̅0) chain sheet model
is more stable using the M06-2X functional than using the CAM-B3LYP
functional.

Introduction
Cellulose ((1 →
4)-β-d-glucan), the most
abundant biopolymer, is the main component of plant cell walls. Cellulose
does not exist in a single molecular chain in organisms, but several
cellulose chains assemble into high-crystallinity microfibrils.1−3 In addition to the conventional uses of cellulose, it is expected
that cellulose can potentially act as an advanced material.4−7 In particular, cellulose nanofibers prepared from wood by refinement
techniques have attracted attention as a next-generation material
because of their high strength, high elasticity, light weight, and
low environmental impact.8−13 Such increasing attention has evoked interest in the atomistic details
of the higher order structure of cellulose.

Cellulose forms
various crystalline allomorphs derived from the
two native crystalline phases: cellulose Iα and Iβ.14−16 One important physical aspect of these allomorphs is that the Iα
phase is metastable and can be converted into the Iβ phase by
hydrothermal treatment17 or high-temperature
treatment in organic solvents or even helium gas.18 It has been suggested that cellulose Iβ is the more
stable form of the two native allomorphs. In the crystal structures
of the native allomorphs, all of the molecular chains are aligned
with the same polarity, which is known as parallel chain packing.19−21 Cellulose IIII can be obtained by treatment of cellulose
Iβ with liquid ammonia or amines,22 and it readily converts back to cellulose Iβ by hot-water
treatment23 while retaining the parallel
chain polarity.24 In contrast, the unit
cell of cellulose II has chains oriented in opposite directions.25−28 The native crystal forms are irreversibly converted into cellulose
II by either mercerization or regeneration processes, which is accompanied
by a complete change in the cellulose chain polarity from parallel
to antiparallel.29

In the crystalline
form, the cellulose molecular chains have a
flat ribbonlike conformation with twofold helical symmetry and amphiphilic
nature, where the polar functional groups mostly align along the side
of the flat ribbon and the ribbon face consists of pyranose faces
with hydrophobic nature. The amphiphilic nature two-dimensionally
expands as the cellulose chains assemble into the flat chain sheet
that characterizes the chain packing manner of native cellulose crystals.30,31 The cellulose chains are bound together by O3···O6
intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the representative intermolecular hydrogen
bond observed in both cellulose Iα and Iβ allomorphs in
common, in the chain sheets, and the O2 and O3 hydroxyl groups participate
in intramolecular hydrogen bonds to stabilize the twofold helical
molecular structure (see Figure 1).24,32−34 Each allomorph
involves the two alternative hydrogen bond networks that are correlated
to the diverse rotational positions of O2 and O6 hydroxyl groups.32,33 The polar functional groups are neutralized by hydrogen bond formation,
whereas van der Waals interactions may dominate at the interface of
the chain sheets,35 as can be seen from
the ab projection of the native crystal model in Figure 2. The multiple weak
hydrogen bonds were also suggested between adjacent chain sheets.
Cellulose Iα and Iβ have similar chain sheet structures,
but the chain packing structures differ in the relative displacement
of the chain sheets along the chain axis.16 Adjacent chain sheets are displaced with a quarter fiber repeat
length, which is called one-quarter chain staggering.19,20 In the cellulose Iα crystal,33 one-quarter
chain staggering progressively occurs in one direction to give a triclinic
unit cell, whereas every other chain sheet is displaced with quarter
staggering in the monoclinic unit cell of the cellulose Iβ crystal32 (see Figure 2). Jarvis suggested the unique features of these hydrogen
bonding networks in the native cellulose crystals in comparison with
the other biopolymers.34 The zigzag, repeating
O–H···O–H··· networks
from the stringed hydrogen bonds running continuously along the fiber
axis, which, coupled with the interconversion between the two alternative
networks, may serve a proton conducting path in the crystal.

Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations of the native cellulose
crystal structures have been performed to analyze the hydrogen bond
networks,36,37 intermolecular forces,38 vibrational spectra,39,40 NMR spectra,41,42 and electronic properties,43,44 where supercell models
consisting of one to several unit cells were subjected to DFT optimization.
Recently, we proposed an alternative strategy to conventional supercell
models for DFT modeling of the cellulose crystals, in which the structures
of cellulose chain sheet models isolated from the parent crystal structures
were optimized until the calculations reached convergence.45,46 In contrast to supercell calculations to reproduce the original
crystal structures and physical properties, we intended to observe
the sheet structure deformation resulting from DFT optimization and
assess the structural stability of the target chain sheet model from
its deformation behavior. Generally, if one wants to evaluate intermolecular
interactions with respect to each dimension, the interactions will
be decomposed along a lower dimensional fragment, whereas the energy
decomposition may have less physical legitimacy in the strict sense.
It is likely that the chain sheet in isolation, free from the crystal
packing force along the other dimension, is on the slope of the potential
energy landscape. The structure would be deformed toward lower potential
surface by DFT optimizations, revealing the intrinsic stress involved
in the chain sheet. In addition to the cellulose Iα and Iβ
chain sheet models, two chain sheet models from cellulose IIII and three from cellulose II were investigated.46 The most striking result was that both of the
native chain sheet models developed a right-handed twist while retaining
the sheet form. A similar sheet twist was observed for the two sheet
models derived from the cellulose II crystal with parallel chain polarity.
The remaining cellulose II sheet model with antiparallel chain polarity
deformed from the initial sheet form. In the two cellulose IIII sheet models, one essentially retained and the other lost
its initial structure. Deringer et al. reported a DFT-D study of isolated
building blocks corresponding to the molecular chain sheets constituting
α-chitin, and they proposed a building block bundled with strong
intermolecular hydrogen bonds to elucidate the nature of the hydrogen
bonding network.47 In their study, the
concept of chain sheets was extended to a stacked molecular chain
sheet in which the chains stacked through the pyranose ring faces.

The plans of the present study are as follows: (1) DFT optimization
of the stacked chain sheet models along the (100) and (010) planes
of the Iα crystal and (110) and (11̅0) planes of the Iβ
crystal and re-investigation of the two flat chain sheet models along
the Iα (110) and Iβ (100) planes (see Figure 2) and (2) benchmarking of the
various levels of theory defined by different DFT functional/basis
set combinations for the present supermolecular systems. As mentioned
above, different interactions dominate at the molecular chain interfaces
for flat and stacked chain sheets, where polar interactions (represented
by hydrogen bonds) mainly contribute to chain sheet formation and
van der Waals interactions are the most significant at the interfaces
between adjacent pyranose faces, respectively. A different DFT functional/basis
set combination could be suitable for the two types of chain sheet
models.

Computational Methods
The six types of molecular chain
sheet models, the (110), (100),
and (010) chain sheets of cellulose Iα and the (100), (110),
and (11̅0) chain sheets of cellulose Iβ, were constructed
based on the set of atomic coordinates reported by X-ray and neutron
diffraction studies.32,33 Each molecular chain sheet model
consists of four cello-oligomers with the degree of polymerization
of 8. As mentioned above, we classified the Iα (110) and Iβ
(100) chain sheet models as the flat chain sheet model and the Iα
(100), Iα (010), Iβ (110), and Iβ (11̅0) chain
sheet models as the stacked chain sheet model.

The positions
of the hydrogen atoms were initially optimized by
classical mechanics calculations using the Glycam 06 parameters,48 followed by quantum mechanics optimization of
all of the atom positions. The level of theory for full optimization
of the flat chain sheet models was either Hartree–Fock (HF)
or DFT with either the B3LYP,49,50 CAM-B3LYP,51 LC-ωPBE,52 or
M06-2X53,54 functional coupled with either the 6-31G(d),
6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), or 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. The stacked chain
sheet models were optimized using either the CAM-B3LYP or M06-2X functional
coupled with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The single-point energy calculations
for all of the optimized models were performed with the 6-311+G(d,p)
basis set.

The binding energy (ΔEbind) between
adjacent oligomers is defined as the difference between the DFT energy
of the total model (Etotal) and its separate
parts (E1 and E2)  where E1 and E2 are the
energies of an interior oligomer and
the remainder of the chain sheet, respectively. Because the four-chain
sheet models contain two interior oligomers, the two ΔEbind values were averaged to give the final
ΔEbind value. The basis set superposition
error (BSSE) for the binding energy was estimated by counterpoise
correction55,56 with either the 6-311+G(d,p)
basis set or the same basis set as those used for the optimizations.

The classical and quantum mechanics calculations were performed
with the AMBER14 program57 and Gaussian
09 program package,58 respectively. The
images were generated with PyMOL software (version 1.7.0.1, Schrödinger,
LLC).59

In the flat chain sheet models,
the degree of twisting deformation
was estimated. As shown in Figure 3, the virtual bonds connecting the gravity centers
of the residues define the torsion angle θ, which represents
the twisting angle of the chain sheet along the fiber axis.46,60,61 The θ value is the average
of the θ values between the positive and negative residue positions.
Obviously, θ depends on the residue position along the fiber
axis. The largest θ value is expected at either of the terminal
ends (θ±4), and θ decreases to nearly
0° on approaching the middle position, or θ±1 if an overall uniform twist occurs. When the chain sheet twists
in the clockwise direction to give a right-handed twist, the θ
value is defined as positive.

Figure 3 Molecular chain sheet and residue position labeling.
The sheet-twist
torsion angles are defined by the virtual bonds connecting the centers
of gravity (G) of the residue(s): θ+4 = G(a,+4) – G[(b,+4), (c,+4)] – G[(b,–4), (c,–4)]
– G(d,–4), θ–4 = G(a,–4)
– G[(b,–4), (c,–4)] – G[(b,+4), (c,+4)] – G(d,+4), and so forth.

Results and Discussion
Optimized Structures of the Chain Sheet Models
Figure 4 shows a
comparison
of the superimposed structures of the initial and CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)-optimized
four cello-octamer chain sheet models along with the root mean square
deviation (RMSd) values between the initial and DFT-optimized structures.
In the case of the stacked chain sheet models, the neighboring chains
slide by one-quarter staggering along the fiber axis (1/4c). Coupled with the twofold helical symmetry of the finite length
cellulose oligomer, this gives the four edge patterns of the chain
sheet models. These variations of the edge structures were also examined
for the Iβ (110) and (11̅0) chain sheet models, and their
CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) DFT-optimized structures are shown in Figure S1.

Figure 4 Superimposed structures of the crystal
(blue) and CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
DFT-optimized (red) four cello-octamer chain sheet models of cellulose.
The RMSd value between the initial and DFT-optimized structure is
shown below each chain sheet model.

In Figure 4, the
chain sheet models can be classified into three types with respect
to their optimized structures: (1) the Iα (110) and Iβ
(100) flat chain sheet models with a right-handed twist, (2) the Iα
(100) and Iβ (110) stacked chain sheets with disordered deformation,
and (3) the Iα (010) and Iβ (11̅0) stacked chain
sheet models that essentially retain their initial structures. The
differences in the edge structures do not have a significant effect
on the optimized structures in terms of the above three classifications
(see Figure S1). Movies S1–S3 show the DFT-optimization
processes of chain sheet models (1)–(3), respectively. The
right-handed twist of the flat chain sheet models was observed in
our previous DFT studies, and we discussed the relation to the similar
right-handed twist of the parent crystal models.46,60,61 A right-handed fiber twist is a significant
issue in real cellulose microfibrils,62 and it has been observed by atomic force and transmission electron
microscopy observations of native cellulose microfibrils.63 Twisted cellulose ribbons have been observed
in vivo during biosynthesis of bacterial cellulose.64−66 In a wide-angle
X-ray scattering study, Fernandes et al. suggested that the twisted
cellulose microfibrils may decrease the distance along the fiber axis
with their coalescence at the crystal faces of spruce wood.67 The present results thus confirm that the fiber
twist of the native cellulose crystal is driven by the inherent twisting
stress in the flat chain sheet.

The deformed stacked chain sheet
models can also be distinguished
by their large RMSd values (>2 Å). When comparing the ab projection structures of the stacked chain sheet models,
the molecular chains overlap more in the retained stacked chain sheets
than in the deformed stacked chain sheets. We have reported similar
DFT optimization behavior in the cellulose IIII (100) and
(11̅0) chain sheet models, where all chains are connected by
hydrogen bonds.45,46,68 The latter chain sheet model has a more overlapped chain arrangement
and retains the initial structure, whereas the former loses the sheet
structure. From both X-ray diffraction measurements23 and our previous molecular dynamics (MD) calculations,45,69 the lines of cellulose chains comprising the cellulose IIII (11̅0) chain sheet are conserved in the cellulose Iβ
crystal during crystalline conversion. In this respect, conservation
of the cellulose Iβ (11̅0) chain sheet structure in the
present study seems to be reasonable. In crystalline conversion to
the cellulose I–ammonia complex, ammonia molecules penetrate
between the (11̅0) chain sheets, leaving the cellulose chain
arrays in the complex phase.70−72 An MD study of the cellulose
Iβ crystal models dissolved in imidazolium-based ionic liquids
found similar diffusion behavior of the solvent molecules, where the
(11̅0) chain sheet resisted penetration of the ionic liquid
from the dispersion in the early stage of dissolution.73−75 It should be also noted that, when comparing the retained stacked
chain sheet models between the two allomorphs, the Iα (010)
chain sheet gives larger RMSd values than those of the Iβ (11̅0)
chain sheet, which may have partly resulted from less stable interactions
between the adjacent chains in the former chain sheet.

Effect of the
DFT Functional/Basis Set Combination on the Flat
Chain Sheet Twist
Figures 5 and 6 show the variation of
the sheet twist angle (θ) with respect to the residue position
for the Iα (110) and Iβ (100) chain sheet models optimized
with different DFT functional/basis set combinations, respectively
(see Tables S1 and S2 for the θ values).
For comparison, the results of HF combined with different basis set
optimizations are shown. Increasing the basis set size leads to a
smoother and more symmetrical sheet twist angle curve, suggesting
that a symmetrical chain sheet twist is indicative of a good description
of the intermolecular interactions. The twist angle curves calculated
with different functionals mostly coincide when using the basis set
with diffuse functions (6-31+G(d,p)). Without diffuse functions, the
DFT optimizations with the M06-2X functional tend to show an asymmetric
sheet twist. The RMSd and difference in the sheet twist angle per
cellobiose unit (Δθ) values for the two optimized flat
chain sheet models are listed in Table S3. The results show that the larger the basis set, the more twisting
there is of the flat chain sheet model. The twist is increased (from
the least to most) in the order of HF, B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, LC-ωPBE,
and M06-2X. The cellulose chain conformations essentially retained
the initial twofold helical symmetry (see Tables S4 and S5 for the glycosidic rotation angles of the optimized
chain sheet structures), indicating that the apparent sheet twist
has been mostly resulted from rearrangement of the cellulose chains.
On the basis of the representative value of Δθ, 7°/cellobiose
unit, the length of the complete fiber twist is estimated to be about
50 nm. On the other hand, the twist lengths of real cellulose crystalline
fibers were observed to be the order of several hundreds of nanometers63,67,76 and even a few micrometers for
tunicin whiskers.77 Possible interpretations
for this difference may be twofold: (1) the chain sheet structures
were optimized in vacuum where electrostatic interactions, especially
hydrogen bonding interactions, were more emphasized than in the crystalline
environment and (2) the interactions between the chain sheets should
have restrained excess sheet twisting in the crystal packing. We have
proposed in the earlier MD studies that the crystal fiber twist was
depressed with increasing
dimensions of the crystal models.60,61

The ΔEbind and BSSE values
between
adjacent oligomers of the optimized Iα (110) and Iβ (100)
flat chain sheet models are given in Table 1. These values were evaluated by single-point
calculations of the optimized structures with the 6-311+G(d,p) basis
set. The ΔEbind values obtained
using the M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP functionals are the lowest for all
of the basis sets, followed by those calculated with the B3LYP functional
and HF. All of the HF energies are weaker than the DFT energies because
of the poor estimation of the electron correlation energy in HF. Marom
et al. and Kruse et al. suggested that the B3LYP functional alone
cannot accurately estimate weak dispersion interactions.78,79 Functionals with long-range correction, such as CAM-B3LYP and LC-ωPBE,
and dispersion correction, such as the M06 family, have thus been
developed,51−54 and they enable relatively good estimation of the noncovalent interactions
for weakly bonded molecular systems.80−84 In the present cellulose chain sheet systems, the
weak intermolecular interactions between the cellulose chains are
well-estimated by the CAM-B3LYP and M06-2X functionals, giving the
lowest ΔEbind values, followed by
those obtained with the LC-ωPBE functional. Unlike the ΔEbind values, the choice of the basis set seems
to have less effect on the BSSE irrespective of the functional. The
ΔEbind and BSSE values derived from
single-point calculations using the same basis sets as those used
for the optimizations are given in Table 2. The BSSE values account for 24.3–34.4%
of the uncorrected ΔEbind values
without diffuse functions and 9.8–14.5% for the 6-31+G(d,p)
optimizations. Allinger et al. reported that that hydrogen bonding
energies between a water dimer and monosaccharides are overestimated
using a basis set without diffuse functions.85 In DFT calculations of carbohydrate molecules, although diffuse
functions on the hydrogen atoms appear to be necessary, the 6-31+G(d)
basis set is sufficient for geometry calculations and the 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set gives good energy values when combined with pure or hybrid
density functionals.86−89 The intermolecular interactions of the present flat chain sheet
models, which are dominated by hydrogen bonds, are more accurately
estimated using basis sets with diffuse functions. It should be noted
that the 6-31+G(d,p)-optimized flat chain sheet models also exhibit
more symmetric twisting, as shown in Figures 5 and 6.

Effect of the DFT Functional/Basis Set Combination on Optimization
of the Iβ (11̅0) Stacked Chain Sheet Model
In
addition to the CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) calculations,
DFT optimization of the four Iβ (11̅0) stacked chain sheet
models, which differ in their edge structures, was performed with
the M06-2X functional. There is no significant difference between
the optimized structures obtained with CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and M06-2X/6-311G(d,p).
The ΔEsheet and BSSE values derived
from single-point calculations using the same basis set (6-311G(d,p))
and those with diffuse functions (6-311+G(d,p)) are listed in Table 3. As observed in the
previous DFT-optimized flat chain sheet models, introduction of diffuse
functions lowers the ΔEsheet values
and effectively reduces the BSSE from 49–73 to 28–39%
of the uncorrected ΔEsheet values.
This indicates a certain contribution of the hydrogen bonding interactions
between the stacked cellulose chains. In fact, O6–H···O5
intermolecular hydrogen bonds are present in both the B3LYP-optimized
Iα (010) and Iβ (11̅0) stacked chain sheet models.
The same hydrogen bond is present in the MD structures of cellulose
Iβ, but it is less frequent.90 The
ΔEsheet values are considerably
stronger using the M06-2X functional compared with the corresponding
CAM-B3LYP calculations. Dispersion interactions (i.e., van der Waals
interactions) are more significant between the cellulose chains in
the stacked chain sheets, so the M06-2X functional effectively corrects
the dispersion interactions in the present DFT calculations.

different edge structures.

Conclusions
In previous theoretical calculations of cellulose crystals, their
structural stability has been mostly assessed on the basis of the
thermochemistry, such as the binding and lattice energies, and their
changes during crystalline transformations.36−44 In these calculations, structure optimization was performed to refine
the initial structures, resulting in slight adjustments of the atomic
positions, such as the exocyclic group conformations. In the present
study, the native cellulose crystal structures were dimensionally
decomposed into three chain sheet models of finite sizes and each
of the models was optimized by DFT with various DFT functional/basis
set combinations. Being isolated from the original crystalline environment,
the chain sheet models often exhibit large structural deviations from
the initial structures and a large amount of computational resources
is required for the optimizations to reach convergence. However, this
has been found to be worthwhile because the present results shed light
on the unusual aspects of native cellulose crystal packing features.
The twist of the flat chain sheet models, which was first reported
in our previous DFT studies,45,46 is reproduced for both
the cellulose Iα (110) and Iβ (100) chain sheet models
by DFT calculations using various functionals and basis sets. Conley
et al. attributed the fiber twist of cellulose crystals to the intrinsic
propensity of a cellulose chain to deviate from the flat ribbon conformation
of exact twofold helical symmetry.91 In
contrast, the present DFT calculations reveal that the cellulose chains
essentially retain the twofold helical symmetry. The higher the level
used for description of the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions,
the more symmetrical and larger the sheet twist of the chain sheets
and the lower the binding energy, suggesting that the intermolecular
interactions may cooperatively contribute to the chain sheet twist.
We should emphasize that the inherent twisting of the chain sheet
is likely to be a main cause of the parent crystalline fiber twist.
In the stacked chain sheet models, a slight difference in chain overlap
results in the optimized structures either retaining the initial chain
structures or losing the sheet appearances. The cellulose Iα
(010) and Iβ (11̅0) chain sheet models with more overlap
retain the initial chain sheet structures, whereas the initial sheet
appearance is lost in the DFT-optimized Iα (100) and Iβ
(110) chain sheet models. It should be noted that the cellulose chain
array constituting the cellulose Iβ (11̅0) chain sheet
has been found to be conserved during crystalline conversions of the
real crystalline phases.70−72 Similarly, the cellulose IIII (11̅0) chain sheet has also been suggested to be “a
conserved chain sheet” in crystalline conversion from the cellulose
IIII phase to the Iβ phase.23,45,46 We thus conclude that the chain sheet twist
and the self-support of the conserved chain sheet are inherited from
the parent crystals. As a future DFT study, the chain sheet models
can be reunited to build a three-dimensional supercell model. For
example, the two-layered flat chain sheet models are expected to twist
with smaller extent owing to the intersheet interactions. Similarly,
the two retained stacked chain sheets are combined to estimate collective
interactions of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

In the present
study, we used the thermochemical properties (herein,
the binding energy) to perform a benchmark test of different levels
of theory rather than for assessing the stability of the crystal packing.
Inclusion of diffuse functions in the basis set appropriately describes
the hydrogen bonding interactions in the flat chain sheet models.
The results of 6-31+G(d,p) optimization are independent of the choice
of the DFT functional and mostly give similar results in terms of
the chain sheet geometry, whereas CAM-B3LYP and M06-2X calculations
give lower values of the binding energy. In contrast, the use of diffuse
functions is likely to decrease the effective convergence of the self-consistent
field calculation and geometry optimization cycles (the 6-31+G(d,p)
optimizations of the stacked chain sheets required a large number
of minimization cycles only to result in convergence failure). It
should be noted that M06-2X calculations coupled with basis sets without
diffuse functions tend to result in less symmetrical twists in the
flat chain sheet models. Single-point calculations with the 6-311+G(d,p)
basis set slightly improve the binding energy values of the optimized
structure over those obtained using the basis set without diffuse
functions, but they are accompanied by relatively large BSSE correction
errors. The above factors are more obvious for DFT optimization of
the cellulose Iβ (11̅0) stacked chain sheet model, where
van der Waals interactions (dispersion forces) are dominant between
the cellulose chains. Single-point calculations with the 6-311+G(d,p)
basis set greatly improve the final binding energy values. DFT calculations
with the M06-2X functional, which has been suggested to well describe
the dispersion forces and hydrogen bonds in the cellulose crystal
models,37 give much lower binding energies
than those with the CAM-B3LYP functional, whereas the binding energies
obtained with both functionals are essentially the same for DFT calculations
of the flat chain sheet models.

It seems likely that the energy
landscapes for the present chain
sheet models consist of a shallow potential well including multiple
local minima. Especially, optimizations of the flat chain sheet models,
while displaying exclusively a right-handed twist, may have been partly
trapped in one of the local minima. Therefore, we were unwilling to
describe the further details of the optimized structures such as the
hydrogen bonding geometries and the side group orientations. To discuss
structural details of the native cellulose crystal of a fiber twist,
the DFT results of the chain sheet and three-dimensional models should
be integrated with those of thorough and systematic calculations of
the related small molecules along with the experimental results.92
