Here,
we control the surface hydrophobicity and the adhesion of
water droplets by electrodeposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole)
(PEDOP) and poly(3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole) (PProDOP) with branched
alkyl chains placed preferentially on the bridge to favor the formation
of nanofibers. Branched alkyl chains of various sizes from very short
(C3) to hyperbranched (C18) are studied because
they have lower surface hydrophobicity than long alkyl or fluoroalkyl
chains (preferable for parahydrophobic properties). The electrodeposition
is much more favored with the PEDOP derivatives because the ProDOP
films are more soluble. However, the formation of nanoparticles is
favored with the PEDOP polymers in contrast to the formation of fibers,
resembling the wax nanoclusters observed on lotus leaves, with the
ProDOP polymers. With both these PEDOP and PProDOP derivatives, it
is possible to reach parahydrophobic properties characterized by a
sticking behavior toward water droplets. This kind of surfaces could
be used in the future in water harvesting systems, for example.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
need to control surface-wetting properties is very important
for various applications, where interfaces are present such as separation
membranes, water harvesting apparatus, nonstick pans, anti-icing windows,
or antifouling paints.1−4 There are numerous examples in nature, where species have special
wettability.5 For example, the superhydrophobic
(both high hydrophobicity and low water adhesion) properties of lotus
leaves are a combination of surface structuration at both micro and
nanoscale and also the surface energy because the nanoclusters present
on these surfaces are composed in a part of hydrophobic waxes.6−8 Other species are also capable to attract small water droplets and
even fog in hot environments.9−12 These properties are known in the literature as parahydrophobic
properties, and these surfaces have both high hydrophobicity and high
water adhesion. These species include red roses and geckos, for example.
For parahydrophobic properties, it is preferable to have surface structuration
at only one scale (micro or nano) and also materials of higher surface
energy. In particular, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures such as
nanofibers or nanotubes are excellent candidates to control the surface
hydrophobicity and water adhesion because these properties are dependent
on their length, diameter, orientation to the substrates, and their
spacing, for example.12−17 Conducting polymers are often used to obtain 1D nanostructures.18−20 In the literature, the polyaniline has been extensively studied
as a polymer model for the understanding of nanostructure formation,
thanks to intra- and intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen
bonds and π-stacking.21−25 In particular, Wang et al. used a theoretical model from aniline
trimers formed at the beginning of aniline oxidation. This trimer
being asymmetric can lead to various assemblies including nanofibers
(1D-growth), nanosheets (2D growth), flowerlike or urchinlike structures
(3D growth), depending on the experimental conditions (pH, reaction
time, etc.).25

For various applications,
it is necessary for the growth of nanostructures
directly on substrates.14 In the case of
conducting polymers, different processes are possible such as vapor-phase
polymerization, plasma polymerization, electropolymerization, or electrografting.26,27 Among them, the electropolymerization, also called electrochemical
polymerization or conducting polymer electrodeposition, was demonstrated
as a fast technique with fine tuning of the surface nanostructures
by playing with both electropolymerization parameters (solvent, substrate,
concentrations, electrolyte, and deposition method) and the monomer
chemical structures.28−31 In this process, a monomer is electrochemically oxidized on a working
electrode to induce the polymerization and the growth of polymer nanostructures.
The electropolymerization is performed on a conductive working electrode
not easily oxidizible such as gold, platinum, stainless steel, titania,
or transparent indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass. For example, aluminum
is not a suitable substrate because of the presence of an oxide layer.
The polymer growth can also be controlled with the deposition charge/time
or the number of deposition scans. Another advantage is that the process
is possible whatever the shape of the substrate such as mesh, textile,
foam, or tube. Hydrophobic substituents can also be grafted to change
the surface energy even if the substituent can also affect the surface
structures. For example, fluorinated and linear alkyl chains were
used to obtain superhydrophobic properties, whereas branched alkyl
chains and aromatic groups (substituents of lower hydrophobicity)
to obtain parahydrophobic properties.32

The monomers of the 3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole family such as
3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole
(EDOP) and 3,4-propylenedioxypyrrole (ProDOP) were now sufficiently
studied in the literature.33−35 The resulting polymer films are
expected to have exceptional optoelectronic properties such as high
conductivity, electrochromism, and rapid redox switching.

For
the formation of nanofibers, it is preferable to keep amino
(NH) groups free, favoring hydrogen bonds. Indeed, it is possible
to place the substituent on the 3,4-ethylenedioxy bridge.36,37 Fortunately, it was reported that a very interesting way to synthesize
both EDOP and ProDOP derivatives with hydroxyl groups on the bridge
is through the reaction with epibromohydrin.38 The formation of nanofibers was found to be possible using fluorinated
chains.

Here, to obtain parahydrophobic nanofibers, branched
alkyl chains
of various sizes from very short (C3) to hyperbranched
(C18) have been grafted on the 3,4-alkylenedioxy bridge
of EDOP and ProDOP. Figure 1 shows the different EDOP-br-R and ProDOP-br-R monomers studied, where different Rs are shown in this
figure. The aim is to study their influence on both the formation
of nanofibers and the resulting hydrophobic properties. Such materials
have potential applications in water harvesting or in water/oil separation.39 In water-harvesting systems, for example, it
is important to have as possible both the highest apparent contact
angle while having the strongest water adhesion. The aim is to capture
water droplets and to release them such that their size becomes higher.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Electrodeposition
First of all, the
monomer oxidation potential (Eox) was
determined by cyclic voltammetry and is between 0.90 and 1.08 V versus
saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for the EDOP derivatives and between
1.08 and 1.14 V for the ProDOP derivatives, as a function of the substituent.

Then, cyclic voltammograms were performed to have information of
the polymer growth. The cyclic voltammograms are given in Figures 2 and 3. The most significance is the intensity of the peaks, which
is much more important using the EDOP monomers, indicating especially
higher polymer insolubility and as a consequent a higher amount of
polymer on the working electrode (confirmed later in the article).
However, the oxidation potentials of the polymers are very low (below
0 V vs SCE), which shows that the polymer chain lengths are long.

voltammograms of the EDOP derivatives (0.01 M) in anhydrous
acetonitrile with Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M); scan rate:
20 mV s–1.

Figure 3 Cyclic voltammograms of the ProDOP derivatives (0.01 M) in anhydrous
acetonitrile with Bu4NClO4 (0.1 M); scan rate:
20 mV s–1.

To better characterize our polymers, we performed UV–vis
absorption spectra. For that, the polymers were electrodeposited on
2 cm2 ITO substrates but at a constant potential (E = Eox) because it is a better
polymerization method for these monomers. A deposition charge of 200
mC cm–2 was selected for this characterization.
Only the EDOP series was chosen because it was not possible to obtain
polymer films with all of the ProDOP monomers. For the UV–vis
measurement, it was also necessary to dedope the polymers (for 15
min at −1 V vs SCE) before measurement. The spectra are given
in Figure 4. This figure
shows that the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) is approximately the same λmax ≈ 414–416
nm for the polymers with branched alkyl chain from C3 to
C11, whereas it increases a little to ≈432 nm for
the longest branched alkyl chains (C15 and C18), which may indicate longer polymer chains. Moreover, all of the
spectra display also strong absorption in the long wavelength region,
which indicates that these polymers were still in the heavily doped
state. This is not surprising because it is known that the polymers
of the poly(3,4-alkylenedioxypyrrole) and poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene)
are extremely stable in their doped state, and as a consequence, it
is extremely difficult to fully reduce them.33−35

spectra of the dedoped PEDOP polymers.

For the surface characterization, the polymers were electrodeposited
on 2 cm2 gold plates at a constant potential (E = Eox) but using different deposition
charges (Qs from 12.5 to 400 mC cm–2) to control the polymer growth.

With the ProDOP
monomers, the deposition was possible only with
ultralong branched alkyl chains (ProDOP-br-C15 and ProDOP-br-C18). Hence, the
high hydrophobicity of these long branched alkyl chains facilitates
their deposition even if they induce important steric hindrance. Hence,
using ProDOP-br-C3, even if a peak was
present in the cyclic voltammetry curve, the polymer is soluble and
cannot form insoluble film on the working electrode. By contrast,
using ProDOP-br-C18, a thin film is formed
but is less soluble.

With the EDOP derivatives, all of the polymers
could be deposited
because of the higher polymer insolubility, as observed by cyclic
voltammetry. To better understand their solubility, solubility tests
in acetonitrile were performed (Table 1). It was observed that all of the PEDOP polymers are
more insoluble than the PProDOP polymers whatever the branched alkyl
chain. By contrast, the increase in the branched alkyl chain increases
the polymer insolubility.

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images are given in Figures 5 and 6. For the EDOP derivatives,
a very significant change was
observed in the surface morphology from smooth to spherical nanoparticles
because the branched alkyl chain increases (Figure 5). Moreover, this change is observed from
C15 branched alkyl chain. This change in the surface morphology
confirms previous works showing that it is possible to change the
surface morphology from smooth to rough, if there is a huge change
in the polymer solubility.40 Compared to
previous works,37 it should also be noticed
that when linear alkyl chains are used, this change takes place with
a shorter chain, and even shorter using fluorinated chains showing
that the main parameter is the substituent hydrophobicity.

Here, the presence of nanoparticles induces a high
increase in
the surface hydrophobicity with θw up to 135°
for Qs = 400 mC cm–2 (Table 2). Moreover,
these surfaces are completely sticky (parahydrophobic),11 as shown in Figure 7. Water droplets placed on these surfaces
remained completely stuck on them whatever the surface inclination,
as observed on rose petals.10 Indeed, for
applications in water-harvesting systems, the best is to have the
highest apparent contact angle while being completely sticky.

In
the case of ProDOP derivatives, crystal-like structures are
obtained with ProDOP-br-C15 (Figure 6). Interestingly,
the crystal-like structures look similar to the structures observed
on lotus leaves.6 This is not surprising
because the structures are in part composed of hydrocarbon waxes,
which are composed of esters with very long alkyl chains. Using ProDOP-br-C18, both large wrinkles and spherical nanoparticles
are observed leading also to a high increase in θw up to 128° for Qs = 400 mC cm–2 (Table 3).

3 Conclusions
Here, we chose to investigate the electrodeposition
of PEDOP and
PProDOP films with branched alkyl chains [from very short (C3) to hyperbranched (C18)] grafted on the 3,4-alkylenedioxy
bridge with the aim to favor the formation of nanofibers with parahydrophobic
properties. It was easier to obtain insoluble polymer films with PEDOP
polymers, whereas the polymer insolubility increased with the branched
alkyl chain length. The formation of nanoparticles was more favored
with the PEDOP polymers, whereas with the ProDOP polymers, it was
possible to obtain nanofibers, resembling wax nanoclusters observed
on lotus leaves. Moreover, with both these PEDOP and PProDOP polymers,
it was possible to reach parahydrophobic properties with extremely
high water adhesion. These surface properties are extremely interesting
and could be applied in the future for water harvesting systems, for
example.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis
Way for the Monomers
As
shown in Scheme 1,
the monomers were synthesized in nine steps by adapting a procedure
reported in the literature.38 The key molecules
were ProDOP-OH and EDOP-OH obtained by reaction with epibromohydrin,
followed by nitrogen deprotection, saponification, and decarboxylation.
Then, branched alkyl chains purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or TCI were
grafted by simple esterification. More precisely, an absolute dichloromethane
solution was prepared containing 1.2 equiv of alkanoic acid, 1.2 equiv
of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride, and N,N-dimethylaminopyridine
as the catalyst. The solution was stirred for 30 min, and an acetonitrile
solution with 1 equiv of ProDOP-OH or EDOP-OH was added and the mixture
was stirred for 1 day. Then, crude products were purified by column
chromatography using tetrahydrofuran/petroleum ether at a ratio of
60:40 as the eluent. Triethylamine (10%) was added in silica gel to
protect the very sensitive products.

4.2 Surface
Preparation
Electropolymerizations
were realized with an Autolab potentiostat (Metrohm) and a three-electrode
system. A glassy carbon rod was used as the counter electrode, and
a SCE was used as the reference electrode. A platinum tip was first
used as the working electrode to study the electropolymerization,
whereas 2 cm2 gold plates were used for surface characterization.
Anhydrous acetonitrile (10 mL) was inserted inside the electrochemical
cell and 0.1 M of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) and 0.01 M of monomer were added.

4.3 Surface
Characterization
The surface
properties were investigated using different equipment. The surface
morphology was obtained by SEM using a 6700F microscope (JEOL). The
arithmetic (Ra) and quadratic (Rq) surface roughness were determined with a
WYKO NT1100 optical profiling system (Bruker). The measurements were
realized with the working mode high-mag phase-shift interference,
the objective 50×, and the field of view 0.5×.

For
the surface-wetting properties, a DSA30 goniometer (Krüss)
was used. Here, 2 μL of 0water droplets were slowly placed on
the substrate. Thanks to a camera, the apparent contact angles are
taken at the triple point. To characterize the adhesion behavior,
6 μL of water droplets was slowly placed on the substrate and
the substrate was inclined until the droplet moves (tilted-drop method).
The inclination inducing a deformation of the water droplet, the advanced
and receding contact angle, and as a consequence, the hysteresis were
taken but just before the droplet moves. If the droplet does not move
whatever the surface inclination, then the surface is called sticky.
