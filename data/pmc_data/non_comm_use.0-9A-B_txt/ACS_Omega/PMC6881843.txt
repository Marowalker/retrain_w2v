Okra stem biochar
(OSBC) and black gram straw biochar (BGSBC) were
prepared by slow pyrolysis at 500 and 600 °C, respectively. OSBC
and BGSBC were characterized using SBET, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy, SEM–energy
dispersive X-ray, and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. High carbon
contents (dry basis) of 66.2 and 67.3% were recorded in OSBC and BGSBC,
respectively. The OSBC surface area (23.52 m2/g) was higher
than BGSBC (9.27 m2/g). The developed biochars successfully
remediate fluoride contaminated water. Fluoride sorption experiments
were accomplished at 25, 35, and 45 °C. Biochar-fluoride adsorption
equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, Temkin,
Koble–Corrigan, Radke and Prausnitz, Redlich–Peterson,
and Toth isotherm models. The sorption dynamic data was better fitted
to the pseudo-second order rate equation versus the pseudo-first order
rate equation. The Langmuir sorption capacities of QOSBC0 = 20
mg/g and QBGSBC0 = 16 mg/g were obtained. Biochar fixed-bed
dynamic studies were accomplished to ascertain the design parameters
for developing an efficient and sustainable fluoride water treatment
system. A column capacity of 6.0 mg/g for OSBC was achieved. OSBC
and BGSBC satisfactorily remediated fluoride from contaminated ground
water and may be considered as a sustainable solution for drinking
water purification.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Excessive fluoride in drinking water has been reported in different
parts of the world.1 Bureau of Indian standard
(BIS) recommended 1.5 mg/L as the permissible limit for fluoride in
drinking water.2 Fluoride shows health
benefits at low concentrations (0.5–1.0 mg/L). But at concentrations
>1.5 mg/L, fluoride is toxic and can cause dental and skeletal
fluorosis.3,4 Fluoride-bearing minerals include cryolite,
sellaite, fluorspar,
fluormica, fluorapatite, topaz, biotite, epidote, and tremolite are
the major fluoride contamination sources in groundwater. Groundwater
fluoride concentration is controlled by the physical, chemical, and
geological properties of the source aquifer including its depth, porosity,
acidity, and temperature of the surrounding soil and sediments, action
of chemical elements, and weathering intensity.5,6 Fluoride
anthropogenic sources include effluents from metallurgy, fertilizers,
semiconductors, and glass manufacturing industries.7

Approximately twenty developing and developed nations
are endemic
to fluorosis.1 India, China, and African
countries of the rift valley region are the most severely affected.1 In India, fluorosis is prevalent in many states.1,8−10

Precipitation,11 ion-exchange,12,13 adsorption,14,15 membrane separation,16 nanofiltration,17 reverse osmosis,18,19 and electrodialysis,20 were used for water defluoridation. Adsorption
is considered to be a sustainable method due to its low operational
cost, better adsorption capacity, adsorbent regeneration and reuse,
and excellent water quality without any sludge generation.1

Several adsorbents including activated
and impregnated alumina,21 activated carbon,15 bone char,22,23 zeolite,24 bauxite,25 calcite,26 calcined clay,27,28 activated
fly ash,29 biosorbent,30,31 and biochar32,33 were applied for water defluoridation.
Many other suitable adsorbents
for the fluoride remediation have been reviewed.1,34 The
biochar use for water decontamination is a relatively new approach.35 Biochar is characterized by a high surface area
which plays an important role in contaminant removal. Micropores in
biochar contribute toward most of the biochar’s surface area.36 Biochar is characterized by plenty of surface
functional groups which are also responsible for contaminants removal.37 In the present investigation, fluoride was successfully
eliminated using okra stem biochar (OSBC) and black gram straw biochar
(BGSBC) derived from okra stem (OS) and black gram straw (BGSs), respectively.
Large availability of these agricultural residues makes them suitable
candidates for biochar development and application in fluoride removal.
Biochars were also successfully applied in actual groundwater defluoridation.
The possible adsorption mechanisms are also elucidated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
OSBC and BGSBC were
obtained via the slow pyrolysis of OSs at 600 °C and BGSs at
500 °C for 30 min (Figure 1). These biochars were used for water defluoridation without
any further modification.

Figure 1 Experimental set-up for biochar preparation
and fluoride sorption.

The physicochemical properties32,38 of OSBC and
BGSBC are summarized in Table 1. OSBC and BGSBC were characterized by 66.2 and 67.3% carbon,
respectively. OSBC is characterized by higher nitrogen (6.55 wt %)
than BGSBC (1.71 wt %). Slightly lower oxygen content (calculated
by difference) was recorded in OSBC (21.99 wt %) than BGSBC (24.67
wt %). The surface area of OSBC (23.52 m2/g) was higher
versus BGSBC (9.27 m2/g). The total pore volume at P/P0 = 0.97 of OSBC (0.0156
cm3/g) was more than BGSBC (0.0083 cm3/g). The
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) adsorption average pore
diameter of OSBC (29.83 nm) was higher versus BGSBC (16.70 nm). The
average pore size indicates that both biochars are mesoporous in nature.

a Oxygen was determined by difference.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
of BGSBC and OSBC show a sharp
peak at 2θ = 29.3° with d value = 3.03
Å indicated the calcite (CaCO3) presence (Figure 2).39,40 The presence of carbonate minerals is possibly due to the reaction
of cations (K+, Ca2+, and Na+) in
feedstock with carbon during pyrolysis.41 Quartz (SiO2) presence in BGSBC (Figure 2) is shown by a sharp and small peak at 2θ
= 26.64° (d = 3.33 Å). The peak at 2θ
= 72.61° in OSBC and BGSBC is also assigned to SiO2.42 The small peak at 2θ = 43.6°
corresponds to periclase (MgO) in both the biochars.43

Figure 2 XRD spectra of OSBC and BGSBC.

Various peaks were present in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of OSBC and BGSBC. Both OSBC and BGSBC exhibit almost similar
FTIR spectra (Figure 3). The peaks at 3630 and 3337 cm–1 correspond to
the −OH stretching vibration of phenolic and/or alcoholic groups.44,45 The peak at 1575 cm–1 in both biochars indicates
alkene stretching vibrations.46 However,
this peak is slightly diminished in OSBC (Figure 3). The band at 1454 cm–1 in both biochars is assigned to methyl C–H bending vibrations.47 However, this peak shows a little shifting toward
left in OSBC. A sharp peak around 875 cm–1 assigned
to strong bending of C–H phenyl rings.48 The peaks at 755 and 619 cm–1 in OSBC correspond
to aromatic C–H vibrations.49−51

and BGSBC.

Surface morphology plays an important
role in solid–liquid
interactions.32 The surface morphology
of OSBC and BGSBC was examined using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging at different magnifications (Figures 4 and 5). Both biochars
show the presence of highly porous structures. Surface canals are
clearly visible in OSBC [Figure 4b]. Honeycomb-like structures are visible in BGSBC
[Figure 5c]. Partially
melted structures also appear [Figure 4c] which may be due to the exposure to higher temperatures.32 The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis provides
proportionate elemental composition of biochars [Figure S2a,b]. Both OSBC and BGSBC are characterized by carbon
and oxygen as a major element with traces of calcium, magnesium, sodium,
and potassium. OSBC and BGSBC show gold peaks at ∼2 and ∼10
keV which are due to gold coating on the biochar’s surface
to make it conductive. The distribution of calcium, oxygen, and silica
on the surfaces of OSBC and BGSBC is shown in EDX mapping images (Figures 6 and 7).

Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis results
obtained
for OSBC and BGSBC is compiled in Table S1. Calcium, chlorine, potassium, phosphorus, and sulfur were present
in both the biochars. Other elements were found in traces. OSBC has
relatively higher concentrations of magnesium, aluminum, calcium,
phosphorus, and sulfur versus BGSBC.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of OSBC and BGSBC
at different magnifications are shown in Figure 8a–d. The primary particles of OSBC
are globular in shape having a diameter in the range of 64–228
nm at 15 000× magnification [Figure 8b]. The shape of primary BGSBC particles
is polygonal flakes with a diameter of 78–170 nm at 30 000×
magnification [Figure 8d].

2.2 Equilibrium and Dynamic
Studies
Batch
equilibrium sorption studies at different pHs, contact time, temperature,
and liquid to solid ratios were conducted. Sorption dynamics and equilibrium
uptake isotherms are explained in subsequent sections.

2.2.1 Effect of pH
These experiments
were conducted at a pH of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (initial fluoride concentration
= 10 mg/L and biochar dose = 0.5 g/L) (Figure 9). Fluoride sorption decreased with the rise
in the solution pH (Figure 9). Best fluoride adsorption was recorded at pH 2.0 followed
by a sudden decrease at pH > 2.0. Similar results were reported
for
fluoride adsorption on other biochars.32,33,52 Biochar exhibits hydrophobic and hydrophilic, acidic
and basic properties which are dependent on feedstock types, pyrolysis
temperature, and residence time.32 Hydroxyl,
carboxylic acid, anhydride, ketone, ether, quinone, lactone, catechol,
pyrone, and hydroxyl ketone were reported on the surface and subsurface
of biochar.53 Oxygenated functional groups
in biochar contain lone pair electrons which do not participate in
the adsorption of negatively charged fluoride ions due to repulsion.
However, at low pH (<2.5), protonation of these basic active sites
takes place on the biochar’s surface.32 This protonation creates a net positively charged surface resulting
in the electrostatic attraction of negatively charged fluoride ions.32 Moreover, protonated groups can hold fluoride
by electrostatic attractions as shown below54

Figure 9 Effect
of initial pH on fluoride uptake on OSBC and BGSBC [initial
F– conc = 10 mg/L; biochar concentration = 0.5 g/L;
temp = 25 °C].

At lower pH, an electrophilic
carbon is formed by the protonation
and dehydration of hemicelluloses or cellulose residue if any remains
on the surface of biochar (Figure 10a). The empty p-orbital on carbon overlaps with the
filled p-orbital on an adjacent oxygen stabilizing the carbocation.
This electron deficient cation reacts with the fluoride ion (Figure 10a). The ion exchange
mechanism can also play a role in fluoride removal. The ion exchange
occurs though quaternary ammonium sites (if available) on biochar
surfaces (Figure 10b). The fluoride ion is strongly exothermically solvated by water.
Thus, it needs strongly acidic groups to directly protonate. H-bonding
by COOH to the solvated anion assists electrostatic attraction of
fluoride (Figure 10c). Figure 10c shows
how carboxyls and phenols might compete with H2O to solvate
fluoride (Figure 10c). As this occurs on surfaces and within the swollen bulk of oxygen-rich
pyrolysis biochars. An outside chance also exists for fluoride ion
to react with SiO2 present in biochar (Figure 10d). These possible interactions
are shown in Figure 10a−d.

Figure 10 Possible fluoride sorption mechanisms on OSBC and BGSBC
(a) fluoride
substitution onto protonated biochar at low pH, (b) ligand exchange
mechanism, (c) hydrogen bonding onto biochar, and (d) fluoride ion
reaction with SiO2.

At high pH, fluoride uptake decreased which can also be explained
due to an increase in the competition between negatively charged hydroxyl
and fluoride ions.55 The equilibrium solution
pH shifts toward neutral to alkaline as shown in Figure 9. Therefore, all the kinetic
and equilibrium studies were carried out at an optimum pH of 2.0.

2.2.2 Effect of the Adsorbent Dose
The
adsorbent concentration effect was studied at 1.0–2.5 g/L for
OSBC and 0.5–2.5 g/L for BGSBC (pH = 2.0; fluoride concentration
= 10 mg/L and equilibrium time = 24 h). The OSBC concentration effect
on fluoride sorption is shown in Figure S3a. The fluoride uptake increases substantially from 70 to 85% with
an increase in OSBC concentration from 1.0 to 2.0 g/L. However, fluoride
uptake rises by only 6% on additional increase in the biochar concentration
from 2.0 to 2.5 g/L. The time required by an adsorbent to reduce 50%
of the initial adsorbate concentration is known as half-life (t50). The t50 of
fluoride uptake decreased with the rise in the biochar concentration.
The half-life values are provided in Table 2 [t50 = 0.5 h
(at 2.5 g/L), t50 = 1 h (at 2 g/L), and t50 = 2 h (at 1 g/L)]. The BGSBC concentration
effect on fluoride sorption is shown in Figure S3b. Fluoride sorption increases from 40 to 95% when the BGSBC
concentration increases from 0.5 to 2.5 g/L. The half-life (t50) obtained for fluoride uptake on BGSBC at
different doses is summarized in Table 2 [t50 = 0.5 h (at 2.5 g/L); t50 = 1 h (at 1.25 g/L); and t50 = 3 h (at 0.5 g/L)]. Thus, t50 values for BGSBC decrease with increasing adsorbent concentration.

2.2.3 Kinetic Modeling
Kinetics studies
along with thermodynamic parameters are important to determine adsorbent
performance and sorption mechanism. The kinetic performance of an
adsorbent is of great significance in determining pilot scale applications
of an adsorbent. With the kinetic data, solute uptake rate can be
determined. Thus, adsorption kinetics can be considered as the foundation
for fixed-bed studies.56 Fluoride kinetic
data were modeled to the pseudo-first and pseudo-second order rate
equations [Figure 11a,b].57−59 All pseudo-first and pseudo-second order parameters
are compiled in Table 2. Excellent regression coefficients [0.981, 0.997, and 0.998 for
OSBC (adsorbent dose 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 g/L) and 0.980, 0.987, and
0.996 for BGSBC (adsorbent dose 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 g/L)] were obtained
for the pseudo-second order rate equation. The theoretical qe values calculated by the pseudo-second order
equation are also very close to experimental qe values. Thus, fluoride adsorption on biochars is controlled
by pseudo-second order rate kinetics. Thus, electrostatic attractions
between the fluoride ions and adsorbent can be assumed to be the rate
controlling step.54

equation (a) OSBC and (b) BGSBC [initial F– conc

2.2.4 Isotherm Modeling
Fluoride adsorption
isotherm studies on OSBC and BGSBC were performed at 25, 35, and 45
°C (pH of 2.0). The sorption data were modeled to Langmuir,60 Freundlich,61 Koble–Corrigan,62 Redlich–Peterson,63 Sips,64 Radke and Prausnitz,65 Toth,66 and Temkin67 isotherm equations using SigmaPlot 12.0 software.
Discussions about isotherms with their equations are provided in the Section S3. All the fluoride adsorption isotherms
for OSBC and BGSBC are positive and regular in shape (Figures 12 and S4–S10). Fluoride uptake is independent of temperature.
Isotherm parameters along with their regression coefficients (R2) are compiled in Table 3.

Koble–Corrigan and Sips models
better fitted the isotherm
data versus other models for OSBC as shown by the regression coefficient
(R2) values (>0.91). In the case of
BGSBC,
Koble–Corrigan, Langmuir, Redlich Peterson, and Sips isotherms
better fitted the sorption data. Furthermore, isotherm models better
fitted the fluoride adsorption data obtained for BGSBC versus OSBC.
The maximum Langmuir adsorption capacities (Q°)
of 19.95 mg/g (at 35 °C) and 16.05 mg/g (45 °C) were obtained
for OSBC and BGSBC, respectively. Fluoride is better removed by OSBC
than BGSBC. Both OSBC and BGSBC performed better or comparable to
reported sorbents applied for aqueous fluoride removal (Table 4).

2.3 Defluoridation
of Groundwater Samples
Details of the groundwater samples
are summarized in Table 5. The groundwater of the study
area is moderately alkaline with a mean pH of 8.23 (range 7.61–8.51).
The mean value of total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity are
1771 mg/L (range 145–3683 mg/L) and 3614 μs/cm (range
295–7500 μs/cm), respectively. The mean fluoride concentration
in the groundwater samples is 2.0 mg/L (range 0.1–5.9 mg/L).
About 45% of the total groundwater samples exceed a BIS permissible
limit of 1.5 mg/L. Therefore, the groundwater samples are characterized
by high fluoride require defluoridation before consumption.

Thus, groundwater defluoridation
was carried out using OSBC and
BGSBC. The adsorption experiments were performed at 25 °C [dose
= 2.5 g/L, pH 2.0 and contact time = 24 h]. Both initial and final
fluoride concentrations after adsorption are given in Figure 13a,b. After adsorption, the
fluoride concentration in almost all groundwater samples decreased
to <1.5 mg/L of the permissible limit.2 This clearly demonstrates that developed OSBC and BGSBC have the
potential to successfully remediate fluoride from the groundwater.

defluoridation using (a) OSBC and (b) BGSBC at pH =
2.0; adsorbent dose = 2.5 g/L and temp = 25 °C [*sample number
location is provided in Table 5].

2.4 Fixed-Bed
Studies
OSBC was used in
fixed-bed studies to evaluate Vb, Vx, Cb, Cx, tb, tf, tx, tδ, δ, f, percent saturation, breakthrough capacity, and the capacity
at exhaustion point (Table 6). The fluoride removal breakthrough curve for OSBC is shown
in Figure 14. The
shape of this curve is the “S” type.

Figure 14 Breakthrough curve at
an initial fluoride concentration = 5 mg/L;
flow rate = 4 mL/min; pH = 2.0; bed depth = 8 cm and temperature =
25 °C.

The total time (tx) taken by the primary
sorption zone for moving downward out of bed is 3594 min. The (Vx – Vb) value of 9.08 mg/cm2 indicates additional
fluoride adsorbed per unit OSBC area. The primary adsorption zone
length (δ) is 5.78 cm. The time required for initial formation
(tf) of PAZ is 612 min. Breakpoint was
achieved after time (Tb) 997 min. The
time, tδ, required for the PAZ downward
movement in the column after its formation is 2155 min. An empty bed
contact time of 6.28 min and char usage rate of 1.39 g/L were obtained.
The fractional capacity “f” at the
breakpoint to continue in the adsorption zone of the column for fluoride
removal from the solution is ∼0.54. The percent saturation
at a breakpoint is 66.57. A laterite fixed-bed percent saturation
range of 72–92 for fluoride removal was reported earlier.68

The breakthrough and column (exhaustion)
capacities of 2.6 and
6.0 mg/g were obtained. Lower column capacity (6.0 mg/g) than batch
sorption capacity (19.7 mg/g) was observed. This may be due to the
short contact time of fluoride with OSBC, which require more time
to be absorbed. These column parameters may be useful in designing
a large scale fixed-bed reactor for aqueous fluoride removal.

3 Materials and Methods
All chemicals used in this study
were of general or analytical
grade. SPADNS, sodium fluoride (NaF) (99%), HCl (35%), NaOH, HNO3 (69%), and zirconium(IV) oxide chloride octahydrate were
purchased from Merck India Pvt. Ltd. Fluoride (1000 mg/L) stock solution
was made by taking 2.21 g of sodium fluoride and dissolving in double
distilled water. All fluoride solutions (2−100 mg/L) were freshly
prepared from the stock solution. The pH of working solutions was
maintained using 0.1 N NaOH and 0.1 N HNO3.

3.1 Adsorbents Preparation
Okra (Abelmoschus
esculentus) stems (OSs) and black gram
(Vigna mungo) straws (BGSs) were used
for biochar preparation. Both feedstocks (OS and BGS) were collected
from the agriculture field. These were chopped into small pieces,
sun dried, and used for biochar preparation. OS and BGS were slow
pyrolyzed for 30 min in the absence of oxygen at 600 and 500 °C,
respectively. Pyrolysis temperatures and residence time were decided
after performing preliminary fluoride sorption studies on different
biochars obtained at (300, 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C). The detailed
optimization results are summarized in Section S1. Prepared biochars were grinded, sieved, and different sizes
were stored in air-tight containers. Biochars of 30–50 B.S.S.
mesh sizes were used for further sorption experiments.

3.2 Characterization of Developed Biochars
3.2.1 Proximate
and Ultimate Analysis
Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were
determined using a CHNS analyzer
(model LECO CHNS-932). The ash content, moisture content, and volatile
matter were estimated according to the American Society for Testing
and Materials method (ASTM D-1762-84). The oxygen content in biochar
is evaluated by the difference. The surface area, average pore size,
and total pore volume of OSBC and BGSBC were determined using a surface
area analyzer (model Micromeritics ASAP 2010). The OSBC and BGSBC
samples were degassed for 12 h at 250 °C and <10–3 Torr pressure prior to surface area measurements. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method was used to quantify the specific surface area at a relative
pressure P/P0 of 0.2.69 The pore size distribution was measured using
the BJH method.70 The total micropore volume
(W0) of the biochars was measured using
the Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) equation (eq 1).71 1  where, W is the micropore
volume, W0 is the total micropore volume, P/P0 is the relative pressure,
and D is the adsorbent’s characteristic constant.

3.2.2 Powdered X-ray Diffraction
The
XRD spectra of OSBC and BGSBC were obtained by a PANalytical X-ray
diffractometer (X’Pert PRO) through Cu Kα (λ =
1.54 Å) X-ray irradiation@40 mA and 45 kV. The biochar samples
were scanned at a 2θ range of 5.025–89.975° with
2° per min scan speed and 0.33° step size.

3.2.3 FTIR Spectroscopy
The functional
group’s presence in OSBC and BGSBC were identified using a
FTIR spectrometer (model Spectrum Two PerkinElmer). Biochar was homogeneously
mixed using a pestle–mortar with potassium bromide in a 1:20
ratio and its pellets were developed by applying 10 ton pressure through
a hydraulic press (model PCI Analytics, CAP 15T). FTIR spectra of
OSBC and BGSBC were obtained from 500 to 4000 cm–1 in the transmittance mode.

3.2.4 Scanning
Electron Microscopy and Energy
Dispersive Analysis
The surface morphologies of OSBC and
BGSBC were investigated using SEM (model Zeiss, EVO40) at 20 kV/mA.
The powdered biochar sample was mounted on a copper stab with carbon
tape and was gold coated to make its surface conducting. The sample
surfaces were examined at different magnifications. A Bruker EDX system
conjugated with same SEM was used for biochar elemental composition
analysis.

3.2.5 Transmission Electron
Microscopy
TEM, model JEOL 2100F (200 kV potential) was employed
to examine
biochar samples. The biochar sample was suspended and ultrasonicated
for 10 min in ethanol. A suspension drop was put up on the copper
grid and dried. This sample-loaded grid was observed using TEM at
various magnifications.

3.2.6 Energy Dispersive X-ray
Fluorescence Spectroscopy
A EDXRF spectrometer (model PANalytical
Epsilon 5) was used for
analyzing biochar’s chemical composition. The powdered biochar
sample (∼1.0 g) was uniformly spread and sealed in a plastic
cup using transparent mylar foil and analyzed.

3.3 Sorption Experiments
Batch sorption
experiments were performed to determine kinetic and isotherm parameters.
Sorption experiments were conducted at different temperatures, pH
values, adsorbent doses, and contact times. Sorption isotherms were
in a 2–100 mg/L fluoride concentration range. Fluoride concentrations
were determined by the SPADNS method.72 The fixed biochar dose was mixed in a 50 mL fluoride solution and
the suspension was agitated in a water bath shaker (model MSW275,
Macro Scientific, India) for a specific time (up to 48 h). The solutions
were filtered and analyzed at 570 nm using a UV/vis spectrophotometer
model Lamda 35, PerkinElmer. Fluoride uptake on biochar was determined
using eq 2. 2  where, qe (mg/g)
is the amount of fluoride adsorbed by per gram biochar, V (L) is the fluoride solution volume, M (g) is the
biochar amount, and Co and Ce (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium fluoride concentrations,
respectively.

3.3.1 Effect of pH
Solution pH is a crucial
factor in fluoride adsorption. About 0.025 g of biochar was added
into 50 mL fluoride solution (10 mg/L). Fluoride adsorption was carried
out at a pH of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The pH adjustment of fluoride solutions
was made using 0.1 N HNO3 and 0.1 N NaOH. The adsorption
study was conducted at an equilibrium time of 48 h and at 25 °C
under constant stirring in a water bath shaker. The percent fluoride
uptake was determined using eq 3. 3  where, Co and Ce (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium fluoride
concentrations.

3.3.2 Effect of Adsorbent Dose
To optimize
the adsorbent concentration, different biochar doses (0.5, 1.25, 2.5
g/L for BGSBC and 1, 2, 2.5 g/L for OSBC) were added to the 50 mL
fluoride solution (10 mg/L and pH 2.0) at 25 °C. An optimum biochar
dose was determined by calculating the percent fluoride removal at
different time intervals.

3.3.3 Sorption Equilibrium
Experimentations
Sorption equilibrium experiments are necessary
to determine the
adsorption capacity required for designing a fluoride removal system.
Adsorption isotherm gives the relation between adsorbent capacity
and fluoride concentration at a constant pH and temperature.73 The equilibrium sorption experiments were performed
at 25, 35, and 45 °C (initial fluoride conc = 2–100 mg/L;
equilibrium time = 48 h).

3.3.4 Groundwater Defluoridation
Many
cations and anions are present in actual groundwater.74−78 These ions may affect the biochar adsorption capacity determined
using simulated water in lab conditions. The presence of these ions
may decrease, increase, or do not change the adsorption of a desired
contaminant.79 Therefore, interference
due to the coexistence of ions on fluoride sorption on developed biochars
was investigated. Finally, biochar suitability was investigated by
applying it to the groundwater samples collected from fluoride contaminated
areas.

Amadalpur village (28° 27′ 12.52″N
and 76° 39′ 58.45″E), Haily Mandi town (28°
20′ 50.72″N and 76° 45′ 33.45″E),
Kulana village (28° 25′ 31.18″N and 76° 39′
32.94″E), and Patauda town (28° 24′ 12.34″N
and 76° 40′ 38.80″E) in Haryana, India were chosen
for the defluoridation study. Eighteen groundwater samples were taken
in precleaned and sterilized 2 L capacity polyethylene bottles from
hand-pumps or tube wells. Physicochemical parameters of the groundwater
samples were determined using the following standard methods.72 Both OSBC and BGSBC were applied for groundwater
defluoridation. Fluoride sorption studies were conducted in a similar
fashion as discussed in Section 3.3.3.

3.3.5 Fixed-Bed
Studies
A glass column
with an internal diameter of 2 and 40 cm height with a feed reservoir
of 10 000 mL capacity at the top of the column was used (Figure 1). Hot double distilled
water was used to make a biochar slurry. The slurry was then poured
into the glass wool supported column to prepare a biochar fixed bed.
A fluoride solution of 5 mg/L (pH 2.0) was fed into the column at
a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The column was operated in a downward flow
mode at 25 °C. Eluent was collected at an interval of 30 min.
The absorbance was determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a UV/vis
spectrophotometer following the SPADNS method.72

Fixed-bed parameters were determined using a mass
transfer model developed by Weber and later used previously in many
sorption studies.46,80−82 The column
performance can be explained by means of a breakthrough curve.81−83Figure S11 shows an ideal breakthrough
curve, where C and Ve are the fluoride concentrations in the effluent and volume of fluoride
free water passing through 1.0 cm3 of the biochar, respectively.
Column breakthrough point was selected at a low effluent concentration, Cb and exhaustion point at Cx close to Co (influent concentration). The fixed-bed parameters including total
time (tx), mass flow
rate (Fm), time required for PAZ movement
(tδ), depth (δ), time needed
for initial PAZ formation (tf), amount
of fluoride adsorb (Ms), column fractional
capacity (f), percent saturation, empty-bed-contact-time
(time required for influent to be in contact with biochar bed), and
biochar usage rate were calculated using eqs 4–10.46,80−84 4   5   6   7   8   9   10  

4 Conclusions
OSBC
and BGSBC were successfully prepared by the slow pyrolysis
of OS and BGS at 600 and 500 °C, respectively. These biochars
were characterized and successfully applied for groundwater defluoridation.
The surface area of OSBC (23.52 m2/g) was smaller than
that of BGSBC (9.27 m2/g). OSBC and BGSBC are characterized
by carbon and oxygen as main elements and calcium, magnesium, sodium,
and potassium in traces. The oxygen content of OSBC (21.99 wt %) was
lower than that of BGSBC (24.67 wt %). For both biochars, maximum
fluoride sorption was obtained at a pH of 2.0. The pseudo-second order
rate expression better fitted the kinetic data as compared to the
pseudo-first order rate expression, suggesting that chemical sorption
is the dominating mechanism for fluoride adsorption on biochar. Langmuir
adsorption capacities of QOSBC0 = 20 mg/g (pH 2.0; 35 °C; biochar
dose 2.5 g/L) and QBGSBC0 = 16 mg/g were obtained (pH 2.0; 45
°C; biochar dose 2.5 g/L). OSBC and BGSBC adsorption capacities
are comparable to the adsorption capacities of other adsorbents used
for fluoride removal (Table 4). Column study was performed with OSBC to determine the necessary
parameters for a fixed-bed rector design. A column capacity of 6.0
mg/g for OSBC was achieved. Thus, developed biochars may be considered
as effective adsorbents for fluoride removal from water.
