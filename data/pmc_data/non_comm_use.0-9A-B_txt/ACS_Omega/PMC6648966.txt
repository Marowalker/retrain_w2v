Using
density functional theory calculations, we investigated the structure
and electronic properties of cyclooctatetraene (C8H8, COT)-ligand mono- or bi-transition-metal (M) sandwich clusters,
Mn(COT)n+1 (M = Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, n = 1, 2) or (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT), as well as their one-dimensional infinite
molecular wires. All the sandwich M–COT clusters and molecular
wires are rather stable with their binding energies ranging from 3.20
to 7.48 eV per transition-metal atom. Superior to MnBzn+1 complexes, most sandwich
M–COT complexes are in their high spin states with ultrahigh
magnetic moments. Moreover, one-dimensional infinite molecular wires,
[Cr(COT)]∞, [(COT)V(COT)Ti]∞ and
[(COT)Sc(COT)Cr]∞, are predicted to be ferromagnetic
half-metals. Our findings suggest that such M–COT sandwich
complexes may be potential candidates for applications in spintronics.

1 Introduction
Since
the synthesis of ferrocene, Fe(C5H5)2, in 1950s,1 organometallic sandwich compounds,
composed of transition-metal (M) atoms and organic hydrocarbon ligands,
have attracted great attention because of their extraordinary electronic,
magnetic, and optical properties, which have potential applications
in catalysis, spintronic devices, biosensor, and so on.2−22 To date, various organometallic sandwich compounds have been identified,
the metal elements cover alkali (alkaline-earth) metals, 3d-transition-metals,
4(5)f-lanthanide (actinide)-metals, and so forth, and the organic
ligands include Bz (benzene, C6H6), Cp (cyclopentadienide,
C5H5), COT (cyclooctatetraene, C8H8), Np (naphthalene, C8H10), and
so forth. It should be noted that the Bz- and Cp-ligand organometallic
sandwich compounds are the most studied. For example, size-dependent
magnetic moments (MMs) have been found for VnBzm,5 particularly, replacing the Bz by Cp can bring one more net spin
into the clusters.8 One dimensional (1D)
infinite molecular wires, for example, [VBz]∞, [MnBz]∞, [NbBz]∞, and [TcBz]∞, as well as the Cp-ligand analogues like [FeCp]∞, [VCp]∞, and [CrCp]∞, were proved
to be robust ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals (HMs).6,7,9,23 Interestingly,
the HM feature of 1D [VBz]∞ can be kept even under
the elongation up to 12%.7

Additionally,
the lanthanide (Ln) atoms-COT ligand sandwich compounds, LnnCOTm (Ln = Ce, Nd, Eu,
Tb, Ho, Tm, and Yb, et al.), have also attracted great interest because
of their ultrahigh MMs and large thermodynamic stability.10,16 Zhang et al. found that the MMs of EunCOTn+1 increase linearly with the size
of the cluster, under the law of (7n + 2)μB.11 Unfortunately, the FM and antiFM
(AFM) states of these clusters are energetically competitive,11,24 which largely blocks their applications in spintronic devices. Compared
with the extensively studied Bz- and Cp-ligand sandwich complexes,
people’s attention on M–COT sandwich compounds are relatively
scarce.14,27 Experimentally, the transition-metal (e.g.,
Ti, V, Fe, Ni, and Ag)–COT compounds have been produced by
the laser vaporization method;25,26 therefore, it is curious
to know the structure, electronic and magnetic properties, and bonding
characteristics of these M–COT compounds. On the other hand,
sandwiching bi- or multiple-metal atoms between hydrocarbon cyclic
ligands has been proven to be an effective way to modulate the electronic
and magnetic properties28−34 and determine what the effects to the clusters as well as the molecular
wires by sandwiching different transition-metal atoms between COT
ligands are. In this work, we systematically investigate the structures,
electronic, and magnetic behaviors of M–COT sandwich clusters,
Mn(COT)n+1 (M = Sc, Ti, and Cr, Mn, n = 1, 2), as well as
their 1D infinite molecular wires. Besides, the structure analogues
having bimetal atoms, (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT) and
[(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞, are also
explored. Our results show that all the studied M–COT clusters
and molecular wires are very stable and most of them are FM with ultrahigh
MMs. Besides, three one-dimensional infinite molecular wires, [Cr(COT)]∞, [(COT)V(COT)Ti]∞, and [(COT)Sc(COT)Cr]∞ are found to be FM HMs.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Mn(COT)n+1 (n =
1, 2, M = Sc, Ti, Cr, and Mn) Sandwich Clusters
Most of the
Mn(COT)n+1 (n = 1, 2) clusters with normal sandwich configurations
have D4h symmetry (Table 1), except Cr(COT)2 and Mn2(COT)3 which have C8v and D8h symmetry, respectively. The geometric structures
of Mn(COT)n+1 are shown in Figure 1, in which Ti2(COT)3 cannot form a stable sandwich
structure with three COT ligands tilted in some degree (see Figure 1f). The structure
parameters of all the sandwich complexes are summarized in Table S1
in the Supporting Information. The C–H
bonds of COT rings are 1.09 Å and the C–C bonds are in
the range of 1.38–1.45 Å, close to those of Fen(COT)n+1 (1.39–1.42
Å).27 For Sc(COT)2, Ti(COT)2 and Mn(COT)2, the spacing between transition-metal
atom and two terminal COT rings (RM–COT) are uniform.
A different case is found for Cr(COT)2, wherein nonequivalent
distances of 1.41 and 2.13 Å are identified. While in the case
of M2(COT)3, the distance of the transition-metal
atom to the internal COTs are around 1.78–2.28 Å, a bit
larger than that to the terminal ones, ∼1.37–1.65 Å.
Such distinct geometric characters can be ascribed to the nonequilibrium
charge distribution in the COTs as discussed below.

Figure 1 Top and side view of
the optimized structures for M(COT)2 (a–d) and M2(COT)3 (e–h), M = Sc, Ti, Cr, and Mn, respectively.
The distances between transition-metal atoms to the COT ligands are
shown in the figures.

The stabilities of these sandwich compounds can be
evaluated by calculating the binding energy (Eb), which is defined by the following equation 1  where EM, ECOT, and EMn(COT)n+1 are the energies of transition-metal atom, COT ring, and Mn(COT)n+1 clusters,
respectively. Our results show that all the studied systems are rather
stable with their binding energies varying from 3.30 to 7.04 eV per
TM atom (see Table 1), greater than those of Eun(COT)m clusters (∼3.82–5.70 eV).11 Except Ti(COT)2 which has the small
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)–lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) gap of 0.03 eV, all the other systems have
the gaps ranging from 0.18 to 0.37 eV (see Table 1), showing that they are kinetically stable
and can act as building blocks for larger M–COT clusters. Moreover,
the charge density difference (CDD) calculations show that significant
electrons are accumulated on the M–C bonds, indicating the
coordinate covalent bonds between transition-metal and COT rings (see Figure S1). Different from Sc(COT)2, Ti(COT)2, and Mn(COT)2, in which a nearly
equivalent amount of electrons are transferred to the two COT ligands,
the electrons transferred to the two COTs for Cr(COT)2 are
0.67 and 0.52 e, respectively, which is the cause for their nonequilibrium
Cr–COT distances. For M2(COT)3, the charges
transferred from transition-metal atoms to the terminal COTs are much
larger than those of the internal ones. Taking Sc2(COT)3 as an example, the electrons donated from Sc atoms to two
terminal COT ligands are 0.86 and 0.87 e, respectively, while those
transferred to the internal ones are only 0.57 and 0.55 e, respectively,
such distinct charge distribution is responsible for the aforementioned
different M–COT bonding characters.

Comparable to the
mono-metal Mn(COT)n+1 clusters, five types of bimetal compounds, (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT) with (M1, M2) = (V,
Ti), (Sc, Cr), (Cr, Fe), (Mn, Fe), and (Cr, Mn), are also explored
(see Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Similar with Mn(COT)n+1s, all the studied bimetal isomers are rather stable with
high binding energies of ∼3.20–6.54 eV per transition-metal
atom. Moreover, all the bimetal complexes have nonequilibrium M–COT
distances (see Figure S2 and Table S2 in Supporting Information) due to the nonequilibrium charge transfer among
them. As shown in Table S3 in Supporting Information, the charges transferred from the transition-metal atom to the neighboring
COT ligands for M = Sc, Ti, Mn, and Fe atom are very close. Differently,
the charges gained on the two neighboring COT rings from one transition-metal
atom is largely enlarged in the case of M = V and Cr, which is in
accordance with the fact that for the (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT)s with V and Cr, the distance difference between them
and two neighboring COTs are the largest.

Interestingly, rich
magnetic properties are identified for these Mn(COT)n+1 and (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT) clusters. Except Ti(COT)2 which
is nonmagnetic and Ti2(COT)3 which is AFM, the
other three Mn(COT)n+1 (M = Sc, Cr, and Mn) systems are FM (see Figure S3 in Supporting Information), in which the MMs of
TM2(COT)3 are almost doublet of that in their
M(COT)2 counterparts (see Table 1). Besides, all the bimetal (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT) clusters studied here are found to be FM
(see Figure S4 in Supporting Information). The total MMs of these bimetal systems are nearly half of the
sum of MMs of (M1)2(COT)3 and (M2)2(COT)3. As shown in Table 2, the MMs of Sc2(COT)3, Cr2(COT)3, Fe2(COT)3,27 and Mn2(COT)3 are 2, 8, 10, and 12 μB, respectively, while
those of the mixed (COT)Sc(COT)Cr(COT), (COT)Cr(COT)Fe(COT), and (COT)Mn(COT)Fe(COT)
are 5, 10, and 11 μB, respectively (see Table 2).

The origin of such magnetic behaviors can be well understood from
the orbitals plots (see Figures 2 and S5 in Supporting Information). The MM of Sc(COT)2 is contributed from the C-pz state from COT rings, while that of Sc2(COT)3 come mainly from two dz2 states from Sc atoms. For Ti(COT)2,
the electrons occupy equally on two spin channels, while for Ti2(COT)3, the dz2 electrons from two Ti atoms couple antiferromagnetically (see
Figure S3 in Supporting Information), as
a result, the total MMs of these two clusters are zero. Moreover,
we noted that the COT rings on two ends of Ti2(COT)3 couples antiferromagnetically. Particularly, the spins of
the middle COT ligand displays two types (positive and negative) of
spin directions to make sure their better interaction with two-side
Ti atoms. As a result, such electron configuration in Ti2(COT)3 makes the middle COT ring inclined to interact
with Ti atoms, and the same is true for the end rings. In the case
of Cr2(COT)3, Mn2(COT)3, and bimetal (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT), the transition-metal
atoms in the clusters are ferromagnetically coupled, and the MMs are
chiefly provided by d electron states of transition-metal atoms, a
fraction of them comes from the p orbitals of
C atoms (see Figures S3–S5 in Supporting Information).

2.2 One-Dimensional
Infinite Organometallic Sandwich Molecular Wires, [M(COT)]∞ & [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞
The optimized structures of all the 1D mono-metal [M(COT)]∞ (M = Sc, Ti, Cr, and Mn) and bimetal [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ infinite organometallic sandwich
molecular wires (IOSMWs) are shown in Figure S6a–d in Supporting Information. To confirm the magnetic
ground states of the molecular wires, 1 × 1 × 2 supercells
containing two transition-metal atoms are considered (see Figure S6
in Supporting Information). The lattice
constants (L) of these 1D mono-metallic [M(COT)]∞ wires follow the orders of L(Mn)
> L(Cr) > L(Sc) > L(Ti), namely, it is 7.50, 7.46, 6.96, and 6.90 Å for
[Mn(COT)]∞, [Cr(COT)]∞, [Sc(COT)]∞, and [Ti(COT)]∞, respectively. In
addition, for the 1D bimetal [(COT)Ti(COT)V]∞ and
[(COT)Sc(COT)Cr]∞ IOSMWs, their lattice parameters
are 7.30 and 7.58 Å, respectively. In contrast, heavy structural
distortion happened for 1D [(COT)Cr(COT)Mn]∞, [(COT)Cr(COT)Fe]∞, and [(COT)Mn(COT)Fe]∞, which is
recovered to normal sandwich structures on injecting one electron
(see Figure S6g–i in Supporting Information). The lattice constants for sandwich [(COT)Cr(COT)Mn]∞–, [(COT)Cr(COT)Fe]∞–, and [(COT)Mn(COT)Fe]∞– are
7.76, 7.58, and 7.84 Å, respectively.

The binding energies
of the 1D IOSMWs are defined by eqs 2 & 3 2   3  where EM, ECOT, E[M(COT)]∞, and E[(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ are the energies of
transition-metal atom, COT ring, [M(COT)]∞, and
bimetal [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ molecular
wires, respectively. The binding energies of these molecular wires
are in the range of 2.36–6.58 eV (see Tables 2 and S4 in Supporting Information). Based on the Bader charge analysis, the electrons
transferred from TM atoms to COT ligands in 1D [M(COT)]∞ IOSMWs are 1.37, 1.27, 1.14, and 1.27 e for Sc, Ti, Cr, and Mn,
respectively. Such significant charge transfer is responsible for
the stable planar structure of COT ligands. Besides, five 1D bimetal
molecular wires, [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞, with (M1, M2) = (V, Ti), (Sc, Cr), (Cr, Fe),
(Mn, Fe), and (Cr, Mn) are also extended. It is found that 1D [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ with (M1, M2) = (V, Ti) and (Sc, Cr) combinations have stable
linear sandwich configurations at high spin states, for example 5.0
and 5.0 μB per unit cell. Bader charge analysis shows
that every COT ring capture about 1.25 e from transition-metal atoms,
and the lessened electrons for Sc, Ti, V, and Cr are 1.52, 1.37, 1.12,
and 1.02 e, respectively. Furthermore, for the electron-injected [(COT)Cr(COT)Mn]∞–, [(COT)Cr(COT)Fe]∞–, and [(COT)Mn(COT)Fe]∞– systems, the electrons donated from every transition-metal
atom are around 1 e.

The band structures and partial density
of states (PDOS) for these 1D molecular wires are displayed in Figures 3 and 4. In the crystal field of COT, the five degenerated d orbitals
are split into one single-occupied dz2 and two degenerated (dxy, dx2–y2)/(dxz, dyz) orbitals. It is found that 1D [M(COT)]∞ is NM metal, FM metal, FM HM, and AFM semiconductor for M = Sc,
Ti, Cr, and Mn, respectively (see Figure 3). For 1D [Ti(COT)]∞, it
is the dz2 and dx2–y2 electrons from Ti atom contributes to the MM (Figure 3a). The AFM state of [Mn(COT)]∞ is favorable than the FM state by 0.15 eV lower in energy, in which
the local MMs on Mn atoms are +4.28 and −4.28 μB, respectively. 1D [Mn(COT)]∞ is direct gap semiconductor
with the band gap of 1.08 eV. While 1D [Cr(COT)]∞ is robust FM HM with a direct gap of 2.02 eV in the spin down channel.
Moreover, four d electrons (dz2, dx2–y2, dxy, and dxz) in spin up channel results in the total MM of
4 μB. Interestingly, the 1D [(COT)Cr(COT)Mn]∞–, [(COT)Cr(COT)Fe]∞–, and [(COT)Mn(COT)Fe]∞– IOSMWs are all quasi-HMs with the quasi-half-metallic
band gaps ∼1.0 eV (Figure 4f).

for all the systems are also shown. (f) Summary of the MMs and half-metallic

3 Conclusions
By first-principles calculations,
the structure, bonding characters, electronic and magnetic behaviors
of M–COT sandwich clusters, Mn(COT)n+1 (n = 1, 2), and infinite
molecular wires, [M(COT)]∞, are investigated. Except
Ti2(COT)3, all the structures have high geometric
symmetries with high spin states. Besides, all the sandwich clusters
and molecular wires are energetically stable with high binding energies.
For the bimetal (COT)M1(COT)M2(COT) sandwich
clusters, combination of two different metal atoms can effectively
modulate the electronic properties, and the metal atoms in all the
clusters are ferromagnetically coupled with high MMs. Furthermore,
the 1D infinite [M(COT)]∞ and [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ molecular wires, (M1, M2) = (V, Ti) and (Sc, Cr) are stable HMs. Besides,
injecting one electron in [(COT)M1(COT)M2]∞ molecular wires at (M1, M2)
= (Cr, Fe), (Mn, Fe), and (Cr, Mn) can help stabilize the sandwich
structures and all the systems exhibit quasi-half metallic properties.

4 Computational Methodology and Models
All the calculations
were performed within the framework of spin-polarized density functional
theory implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package.35,36 We adopted the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerholf37 generalized gradient approximation as the exchange–correlation
potential and the electron-ion interaction was described by the projector-augmented
wave potential.38 To evaluate the correlation
effects of d orbitals of transition-metal atoms, we tested the influence
of different on-site Hubbard parameters, U (U = 0–3 eV), for sandwich Mn(COT)n+1 (n =
1–2) clusters. Our results show that the MMs of sandwich Mn(COT)n+1 are
insensitive to different U values. Thus, our results are without considering
the on-site correlation effects. The electronic wave functions were
expanded on a plane-wave basis with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. Periodic
boundary conditions were applied along the molecular wire with the
unit cell containing two metal atoms and two ligands. The vacuum region
between wires was larger than 10 Å, all the atoms were fully
relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman force on each atom was less
than 0.01 eV/Å. The reciprocal space was sampled by 1 ×
1 × 11 grid meshes using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme39 for geometry optimization. A denser k-point grid (1 × 1 × 45) was used for electronic
structure calculations. It should be noted that, most systems are
largely deformed after full optimization because of the insufficient
charge transferred to the COT ligands. However, the structures can
be well recovered to normal sandwich configurations in high spin states.
Here, we chose the normal sandwich structures to explore the bonding
characters, electronic and magnetic properties of these compounds.
