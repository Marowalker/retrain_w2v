In this study, a
quadratic cavity is simulated using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD). The simulated cavity includes nanofluids containing
copper (Cu) nanoparticles. The L-shaped thermal element exists in
this cavity to produce heat distribution along with the domain. Results
such as fluid velocity distribution in two dimensions and the fluid
temperature field were generated as CFD simulation results. These
outputs were evaluated using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system
(ANFIS) for learning and then the prediction process. In the training
process related to the ANFIS method, x coordinates, y coordinates, and fluid temperature are three inputs, and
the fluid velocity in line with Y is the output.
During the learning process, the data have been classified using a
clustering method called grid clustering. In line with the attempt
to rise ANFIS intelligence, the alterations in the number of input
parameters and of membership structure have been analyzed. After reaching
the highest level of intelligence, the fluid velocity nodes were predicted
to be in line with y, especially cavity nodes, which
were absent in CFD simulations. The simulation findings indicated
that there is a good agreement between CFD and clustering approach,
while the total simulation time for learning and prediction is shorter
than the time needed for calculation using the CFD method.

1 Introduction
The past few decades have witnessed an increase in the attention
of fluid flow in the industrial domain size in different engineering
applications including lubrication technology, nuclear reactors, pharmaceuticals,
cooling of electronic devices, processing foods, and membrane sequestration.1−7 A large number of research studies has been carried out to study
the flow field and thermal distribution in different shapes of lid-driven
cavities, while the main area of concern has been fluids with a thermal
performance which is relatively low.8−11 Still, there is an increasing
demand for cooling systems with high performance which require a specific
agent with a high heat transfer rate. Choi12 introduced nanofluids as highly effective coolant fluids that outperformed
standard pure fluids as to heat exchange performance. Given the highly
sophisticated thermal and fluid behavior of nanofluids, different
models have been introduced for estimating the specifications of nanofluids,
including thermophysical properties.13−15 The design of the models
is based on heat transfer, Brownian dynamics, and nanoparticle geometry
along with the interaction of pure fluid and nanoparticles.15−20

There are recent reports about thermal distribution in lid-driven
cavities which states that nanofluids can change the thermal behavior
of fluid in the domain. Authors in ref (21) examined the thermal behavior of Cu-water nanofluids
in the cavity by using the numerical method. The authors concluded
that with increasing amounts of nanoparticles, the heat transfer rate
increases. Moreover, they demonstrated that the direction of sliding
walls and Richardson number were effective in the performance of the
cavity in terms of heat transfer. In a similar study by Muthtamilselvan
et al.,22 a lid-driven cavity filled with
Cu-water nanofluids was examined in terms of the transport mechanism
of mixed convection in a numerical way. The numerical results supported
that adding pure water with Cu nanoparticles improved the thermal
performance of the cavity. The laminar mixed convection flows were
examined numerically by Talebi et al23 using
the Cu-water nanofluid fed into a cavity. The results showed that
when Reynolds numbers are fixed, the flow field and thermal distribution
of the nanofluid are affected by the amount of solids in the fluid,
particularly at very high Rayleigh numbers.24,25

It is notable that improving heat transfer using nanofluids
is
still a complicated problem. According to ref26 and,3 the augmentation or decrease in
heat transfer was because of the changes in the models employed to
find the properties of nanofluids. Therefore, there is a need for
further studies on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model nanofluid
properties in a more reliable manner. Such modeling, still, is time-consuming
and needs more funding. The recent development in the field is more
emphasized on the learning process with an artificial neural cell
algorithm called the artificial neural network (ANN) and integration
of this method with the fuzzy system27−30 for solving engineering problems
with shorter computation time. Still, the application of these methods
in studies on thermal energy distribution is highly limited.31,32 The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is known as a
reliable method because it includes the ANN superior features and
the neuro-fuzzy architectures.33−35

The ANFIS structure represents
the ANN and fuzzy logic methodologies.
A key feature of the ANFIS is its capability to train complex relationship
using the pattern data.15,28,36,37 For nonlinear system modeling,
the input space is divided by the ANFIS into several local regions.
A simple local model is created for each local region using linear
functions of adjustable coefficients. Therefore, ANFIS utilizes fuzzy
membership functions (MFs) for dividing each input dimension.38 It is possible to activate many local regions
at the same time to cover the input space by overlapping MFs. A critical
role is played by the resolution of partitioning of the input space
to determine ANFIS ability for approximation. This is carried out
based on the MF count in the ANFIS and the number of layers.

It is critical to find an effective and comprehensive pattern set
for training the ANFIS.39−41 In the case where an incomplete
set (where not every possible condition is met) is chosen as the ANFIS
training set, the network’s capability to deal with an unknown
condition will be attenuated. To improve the capability, a learning
set of the ANFIS must be as wide as possible over the whole space
of the input–output data set. Here, the results of the CFD
simulation are obtained as a part of the study for training the models.
In this study, with the subtractive clustering method, the flow field
and thermal field in the cavity domain are categorized. For better
accuracy of the method, different function structures and input parameters
are used during the learning process. After the learning process,
the CFD results and the ANFIS method are compared with the standard
deviation (StD) method, and then, the CFD and ANFIS flow field and
thermal distribution are compared with each other. The multiphase
flow modeling is used to show the behavior of the nanofluid in the
matrix phase. This type of modeling enables us to analyze the hydrodynamics
between nanoparticles and the primary fluid/phase. In this study,
as a novelty, the interaction between phases is simulated with the
CFD method. After modeling of nanofluids in the domain, a machine-learning
method, such as the ANFIS method, is used to model nanofluids with
a faster modeling algorithm. The machine-learning method is the interface
modeling between CFD and the optimization process to reduce the time
of optimization during process engineering.

2 Methodology
2.1 CFD Method
As shown in Figure 1, a vertical square enclosure
with relevant physical parameters is provided. Constant temperature
conditions are considered for the right and left vertical boundaries.
The value of one is considered for their various dimensionless values
between them.42,43 The temperature of the left boundary
is higher than the right one and is considered to be a hot boundary.20 The solid boundaries are exposed to constant
conditions, and adiabatic conditions are considered for the bottom
and top boundaries. The interaction of nanoparticles with the matrix
phase is simulated by the cubic-interpolated pseudo particle (CIP)
method, and different nanoparticles are used during validation of
the CFD study with the existing analytical solution. In the cavity,
the shear flow can appear in the domain and the shear mechanism can
be changed, and the break-up process during mixing can be defined
and modeled. Therefore, we use simple geometry to define the heat
source or shear mechanism for simulation of the mixing process. In
this work, for the first time, the nanofluid contains Cu in water.
CIP is employed for minimizing the numerical diffusion of a high-order
Navier–Stokes equation for two-dimensional problems.

Figure 1 Schematic and
boundary condition of the cavity.

The equations of vorticity and energy have been obtained based
on the dimensionless analysis16 in which
the thermal diffusivity is calculated as follows20 1  

According to a reference temperature,
the following relation is
considered for the effective density of a fluid with suspended particles44 2  where φ, ρf, and ρs stand for the volume fraction of suspended
particles, pure
fluid density, and particle density, respectively. The effective viscosity
for a nanofluid is provided by Brinkman. This nanofluid includes pure
water with viscosity μf. Brinkman also provided a
dilute suspension of spherical, solid, and small particles45 3  

Wasp developed the effective stagnant thermal
conductivity for
the solid–liquid mixture as follows46 4  

The CIP model is applied for solving the advection term, which
is necessary for solving vorticity, and further details can be found
in ref (16). Several
factors including the thermal conductivity as well as the heat capacity
of both the ultrafine particles and the pure fluid, the nanofluid
viscosity, the flow arrangement, and the volume fraction of solids
particles are the key factors affecting the Nusselt number of the
nanofluids. The nanofluid local Nusselt number is derived as follows44 5  and 6  

The mean
Nusselt number is defined as follows 7  

2.2 ANFIS
Method
The ANFIS is an effective
fuzzy system designed to predict how complicated nonlinear systems
behave.47,48 The ANFIS method is a combination of neural
network and fuzzy system.7,49,50 The learning part is the responsibility of neural cells because
of the great ability of this method in learning different phenomena.
After the learning process, the method transfers all information of
learning to the fuzzy structure system, and the fuzzy system can predict
the process behavior.20,32,51−53 There are three different fuzzy reasonings in which
if-then rules were proposed by Takagi and Sugeno. These were used
in the ANFIS structure.23Figure 2 illustrates the structure
used by the ANFIS method to predict hydrodynamic specifications in
the cavity. Here, X coordinate, Y coordinate, and nanofluid temperature were adopted to achieve nanofluid
velocity (in Y coordinate) as the output. At the
first layer, the inputs were divided into different numbers of MFs.
Then, at the second layer, the input signals generated by the first
layer were multiplied using AND rule and the node function. For example,
the ith rule’s function is as follows 8  where wi stands for
the outcoming signal of the node at the second
layer and μAi, μBi, and μCi represent
the input signals generated from implemented MFs on inputs, X coordinate (X), Y coordinate
(Y), and nanofluid temperature (T), to the node of the second layer, respectively. At the third layer,
the relative value of the firing strength of each rule is obtained.
The total size of all rules’ firing power is as follows 9  where w̅i represents the called
normalized firing strengths.
The fourth layer uses the function of a consequence according to the
if-then rule introduced in ref (54). Therefore, the node function is as follows 10  where pi, qi, ri, and si (known as consequent parameters)
stand for
the if-then rules’ parameters.

Figure 2 Schematic of the ANFIS structure.

3 Results and Discussion
In this article, the CFD method outputs were analyzed as inputs
and outputs of learning processes of ANFIS methods in different requirements
considering the number of inputs and MFs.

Some hypothesizes
have been created in order to start the ANFIS
method which are as follows:In heat transfer, Grashof number (Gr) is dimensionless
in which GR is 71,000.

In nanofluids,
the value shows the nanoparticle percentage
which is 20%.

The P-value
conveys the data percentage
in the ANFIS training process.

The Epoch
frequency is 750.

Generalized bell-shop
MF (gbellmf) is an MF and has
been used in this study.

At the beginning
of the learning process, the x coordinate is considered
as the first input, while velocity
in y is considered as the output, and the number
of MFs equals to 2 in the training process.



Figure 3a,b
shows
the StD error training and testing processes equal to 0.0355. Next,
the learning process occurs with the increase in MFs from 2 to 3 and
4. In this process, the change in the StD value was low which demonstrates
a slight increase in ANFIS intelligence. According to this failure
in increasing MFs of the system intelligence, the number of inputs
changed from 1 to 2, and also, the y coordinate was
considered to be the second input.

Figure 3 (a) Training process errors (one input),
type of MFs is gbellmf,
variety number of MFs, max iteration = 750. (b) Testing process errors
(one input), type of MFs is gbellmf, variety number of MFs, max iteration
= 750.

The learning process is fulfilled
by fixing the number of MFs to
2. Considering Figure 4a for the training process and Figure 4b for the testing process, the StD value in training
and testing processes equals to 0.03422 and 0.034749, respectively.
Considering the previous condition, the StD value did not change a
lot. Hence, the number of MFs increases from 2 to 3 and 4. Then, testing
and training processes were performed once again. The results showed
an appropriate change and increase in the StD value, where MFs equal
to 4. An increase in the StD value for training and testing processes
equals to 0.012898 and 0.012855, respectively. Then, in order to attain
higher intelligence in the ANFIS method, the number of input effects
from 2 to 3 was analyzed; also, the fluid temperature was considered
to be the third input. The learning process was completed separately
for number of MFs 2, 3, and 4. The results are shown in Figure 5a for the training process
and in Figure 5b for
the testing process.

Figure 4 (a) Training process errors (two inputs), type of MFs
is gbellmf,
variety number of MFs, max iteration = 750. (b) Testing process errors
(two inputs), type of MFs is gbellmf, variety number of MFs, max iteration
= 750.

Figure 5 (a) Training process errors (three inputs),
type of MFs is gbellmf,
variety number of MFs, max iteration = 750. (b) Testing process errors
(three inputs), type of MFs is gbellmf, variety number of MFs, max
iteration = 750.

The input numbers increased
from 2 to 3, while the number of MFs
equaled to 2, but there was no significant difference when MFs equal
to 4. However, there is an increase in StD. Now, if MFs change from
3 to 4, there is a significant increase in StD. Therefore, in the
training and testing process, we have 0.015964 and 0.0016816, respectively.
Considering these two numbers, the chances of error are less and we
can see complete intelligence in the ANFIS method (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 Learning process (three
inputs), type of MFs is gbellmf, number
of MFs = 4, max iteration = 750.

In Figure 7, the
degree of membership can be seen. Using the appropriate intelligence
in ANFIS, the absent points in ANFIS learning would be predicted and
also compared with the CFD results, in which, the appropriate correspondence
between the CFD output and ANFIS method can be illustrated (see Figure 8).

Figure 7 Degree of membership
(three inputs), grid partition clustering,
gbellmf, number of MFs = 4, max iteration = 750.

Figure 8 Validation
process (three inputs), gbellmf, number of MFs = 4,
max iteration = 750.

Another ability of the
ANFIS is to predict points that are absent
in the CFD simulation of fluid flow, and it can provoke appropriate
ability in stopping complex CFD method calculations (see Figure 9).

Figure 9 Prediction (three inputs),
type of MFs is gbellmf, number of MFs
= 4, max iteration = 750.

4 Conclusions
In this study, the ANFIS method has been
employed to train the
thermal and fluid field in the cavity calculated by the CFD method.
The grid partition clustering method was used for clustering the fluid
and thermal field in the domain. The flow and thermal distribution
in the cavity were simulated with the clustering method and then compared
with the CFD results. Additionally, the effects of changing parameters
such as the number of inputs and MFs were analyzed in ANFIS intelligence.
We have reached complete intelligence by changing ANFIS intelligence
parameters. We finally predicted the velocity in the domain and compared
the results with CFD outputs. The positive effect of combining ANFIS
and CFD methods in nanofluid studies in a cavity shows that smart
modeling can be a good alternative to predict the flow and thermal
distribution in the industrial domains with inexpensive computational
time.
