The interaction of
protein and surfactant yields protein–surfactant
complexes which have a wide range of applications in the cosmetics,
foods, and pharmaceutical industries among others. Ionic and nonionic
surfactants are known to interact differently with the protein. The
interplay of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions governs the
resultant structure of protein–surfactant complexes. The present
study enlightens the paramount role of the hydrophobic interaction,
tuned by the hydrophobic tail length of ionic surfactants, in the
unfolding of anionic bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein. The unfolding
of BSA in the presence of four different tail-length cationic surfactants,
that is, C10TAB, C12TAB, C14TAB, and C16TAB, has been investigated
by small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering. All
cationic surfactants unfold the protein at a certain concentration
range. The propensity of protein unfolding increases with increasing
the hydrophobic tail length. The denatured structure of BSA upon addition
of cationic surfactants is characterized by the random flight model
representing a beads-on-a-string chain-like complex. The unfolded
protein binds the surfactant micelles in the protein–surfactant
cluster. The micelles get elongated with the increasing concentration
of cationic surfactants, whereas the number of micelles per cluster
is decreased. In the final stage, the protein–surfactant cluster
merges to one large micelle with unfolded protein wrapping the micelle
surface. The pathway of protein unfolding is described in terms of
the changes in the micellar size, the number of micelles formed per
cluster, the separation between the micelles in the cluster, the aggregation
number of micelles, and the number of proteins per cluster. The protein–surfactant
interaction is further examined in the presence of a nonionic surfactant,
that is, C12E10. The nonionic surfactant significantly suppresses
the interaction of BSA protein with ionic surfactants by forming mixed
micelles. As a result of the mixed micelles formation by ionic–nonionic
surfactants, the ionic surfactant moves out from the unfolded BSA
protein, and this enables the protein to refold back to its native
structure. The propensity of mixed micelle-driven refolding of proteins
is significantly changed with changing the tail length of the ionic
surfactant.

1 Introduction
Proteins
and surfactants are among the most important entities
of the soft matter, which, by combining, lead to several interesting
applications in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries.1−3 Bovine serum albumin (BSA), one of the most investigated proteins,
shows a very rich phase behavior with surfactants in the aqueous solution
because of their common amphiphilic nature.4−6 From the viewpoint
of surface activity, both the proteins and surfactants are individually
surface active. It is a firmly established fact that ionic surfactants
such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(DTAB) could denature proteins at low concentrations relative to other
denaturants such as urea or guanidinium chloride.7−11 On the contrary, nonionic surfactants only play a
minor role in the denaturation of some proteins.12,13 The emerging scientific interest consists of the detailed understanding
of protein–surfactant interactions to follow the pathway of
unfolding and refolding of the protein.

Ionic surfactants can
interact with the protein because of the
site-specific interaction of surfactants on the oppositely charged
patches of the protein.14−16 On the contrary, nonionic surfactants
can have only a hydrophobic interaction with the protein.15,17 The differences in the interaction of the protein with ionic and
nonionic surfactants suggest that the protein–surfactant interaction
is primarily driven by their electrostatic interaction. The electrostatic
interaction between the protein and an individual ionic surfactant
occurs at the surface of the protein, which is usually not sufficient
to perturb the native structure of the protein.6,18,19 We identify by dynamic light scattering
(DLS), an optimal concentration up to which CnTAB
(n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) molecules are attached individually
to the protein surface or stay free in the solution. Above this optimal
concentration, which is known as critical aggregation concentration
(CAC), surfactant molecules form micelle aggregates and initiate protein
denaturation. In reality, CAC can be significantly below the critical
micelle concentration (cmc).20 As the process
of denaturation induced by ionic surfactants proceeds, the protein
unfolds extensively, and thus, the internally directed hydrophobic
regions become exposed on the outside of the molecule. This situation
is entropically unfavorable because the hydrophobic segment of protein
molecules is not stable in the aqueous environment.21 The entrapment of water leads to the micelle-like cluster
formation of protein–surfactant complexes.7,22 These
protein–surfactant complexes can be described by the random
flight model representing a beads-on-a-string.7,22,23 As the surfactant concentration is increased,
the protein-decorated micelles start elongating, mostly in one direction,
and therefore, the number of micelles per cluster is decreased. In
the final stage, a large micelle with a very high aggregation number
is formed, and the cluster formation disrupted. In principle, the
number of proteins per micelle becomes too small to allow extension
of the cluster. The unfolded protein wraps the large micelle through
its surface. Thus, the interplay of electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions governs the resultant structure of the protein in the
protein–surfactant complexes. There is another widely used
model called the “bead-necklace” model to define the
protein–surfactant complexes.9,24,25 However, the bead-necklace model does not include
the scattering from the protein, which limits its use to explain the
scattering from protein–surfactant complexes in the absolute
scale.

In this study, we have considered tuning of the protein–surfactant
interaction to modify the resultant structure by varying the hydrophobic
tail length of ionic surfactants. The work reveals that the hydrophobic
interaction, which is responsible for protein unfolding, can be controlled
by the hydrophobic tail length of the ionic surfactant. It is found
that the protein–surfactant complexes with longer tail-length
surfactants reach more rapidly the final stage of the unfolding process,
where the cluster formation is disrupted. The results suggest that
the propensity of protein unfolding induced by the ionic surfactant
is increased with increasing the hydrophobic tail length of the ionic
surfactant. Taking the benefit of the absence of the electrostatic
interaction between proteins and nonionic surfactants and the presence
of strong hydrophobic interaction between the ionic and nonionic surfactants,
an innovative way is proposed to refold back the unfolded protein
or prevent the protein unfolding.11,13,26,27 The hydrophobic interaction
between the protein and the ionic surfactant, and in the ionic–nonionic
surfactant mixed micelle complexes, is examined by changing the hydrophobic
tail length. The dominance of the hydrophobic interaction between
ionic and nonionic surfactants over the electrostatic interaction
of protein and ionic surfactants interrupts the cluster formation.
In the process of refolding, initially large micelles but small in
number are formed at a lower nonionic surfactant concentration. The
number of micelles increases, whereas the size is decreased with increasing
C12E10 concentration. At a higher C12E10 concentration, the interaction
of the BSA protein with ionic surfactants is completely suppressed
by the ionic–nonionic mixed micelle formation. The withdrawal
of ionic surfactants from the protein–surfactant complexes
allows them to refold back to their native structure. The propensity
of mixed micelles-driven refolding of protein is significantly changed
with changing the tail length of the ionic surfactant.

The interaction
of BSA with different cationic surfactants with
increasing hydrophobic tail length, decyltrimethylammonium bromide
(C10TAB), DTAB (C12TAB), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C14TAB),
and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB) with and without nonionic
polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10) is studied by small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) and DLS. The unfolding of the protein structure
in the presence of cationic surfactants is examined with varying concentrations
of surfactants, whereas the refolding of the same is studied in the
presence of combined cationic and nonionic surfactants at varying
nonionic surfactant concentrations while keeping the cationic surfactant
concentration fixed. The detailed structural analysis of the above
protein–surfactant complexes is reported using SANS data and
supported by DLS measurements.9,11,13,27,28

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Unfolding
of Protein: Role of Surfactant Tail
Length
In the protein–surfactant complexes, some significant
concentrations of the monomeric CnTAB are present,
which can interact with BSA in ways that are different from the micelle
formation. The surfactant molecules, which do not participate in the
micelle formation, are quantified by DLS measurement by finely tuning
the ionic surfactant concentration and tracking the changes in the
hydrodynamic size at the same time. The interactions of 1 wt % BSA
with differently concentrated CnTAB are presented
in Figure 1. The numbers
of free or monomerically attached CnTAB in the BSA–CnTAB complexes are different for different hydrophobic tail-length
ionic surfactants because of their dissimilar hydrophobic interaction
strength with the protein. Below CAC, the ionic surfactants either
remain free or molecularly attached to BSA, and the overall size of
the complexes is marginally increased. At CAC, a sharp rise in the
hydrodynamic size of the BSA–CnTAB complexes
is observed, which indicates the micelle formation. The hydrodynamic
size of BSA–CnTAB stayed almost constant with
further increasing the surfactant concentration. Interestingly, a
drop in the critical micelle concentration (cmc) is observed for each
surfactant, which is more prominent for the shorter tail-length cationic
surfactants. The CAC is obtained as 1.0, 1.5, 5.5, and 40 mM for C16TAB,
C14TAB, C12TAB, and C10TAB, respectively (cmc for C16TAB, C14TAB,
C12TAB and C10TAB are 1.0, 3.5, 15.0, and 61.8 mM, respectively).29 The decreased CAC compared to cmc results from
the interaction of anionic BSA with adsorbed oppositely charged surfactants,
which act as a driving force to increase the hydrophobicity of the
BSA–CnTAB complexes.15,20

size variation of 1 wt % BSA with differently concentrated
CnTAB (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) in
20 mM phosphate buffer of pH 7 at 25 °C.

SANS measurement is carried out for pure BSA and along with
ionic
surfactants having different tail lengths and at varying concentrations.
The data are presented in Figure 2. No interparticle interaction (i.e., S(q) ≈ 1) is observed in the scattering data
of 1 wt % BSA protein; hence, the scattering data fitted with the
form factor alone. The analysis of SANS data yields an oblate ellipsoid
(ε < 1) having semimajor axes 39.7 Å and semiminor axes
14.6 Å, which are in good agreement with the published result.30 SANS data from individual components of 1 wt
% ionic surfactants (C10TAB, C12TAB, C14TAB, and C16TAB) and nonionic
C12E10 are shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Micelles containing ionic CnTAB (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) are found to have the prolate ellipsoidal
core–shell structure.31 The concentration
of each of the surfactants is varied from 0 to 80 mM. Because of the
very high CAC (CACC10TAB = 40 mM), C10TAB molecules mostly
remain free or weakly bound as monomers to the protein up to ci = 40 mM (Figure 2A). Above ci =
40 mM, C10TAB forms micelles with the BSA protein and unfolds its
native structure. At ci = 80 mM, the indirect
Fourier transformation (IFT) of SANS data shows the appearance of
the second maximum, which indicates the formation of such a micelle-like
cluster of the protein–surfactant complexes. The peak at lower-r is related to the intramicelle scattering and revealed
the size of the micelles, whereas the peak at larger-r comes from the intermicellar interaction and reveals the center-to-center
distance of one micelle to the next nearest micelle.32,33 However, the complexes formed by the protein and the surfactant
are more complicated and other intermicellar correlations may come,
which is hard to model through the p(r) function.

0–80
mM (A) C10TAB, (B) C12TAB, (C) C14TAB, and (D) C16TAB. (Right) Pair
distance distribution functions p(r) obtained from the fits of the experimental data.

The tail-length-dependent structural changes of
the BSA–CnTAB (n = 12, 14,
and 16) complexes can
be explained from the shape of p(r). The formation of the micelle-like clusters in the protein–surfactant
complexes for all the surfactants is indicated by the appearance of
multidomain aggregates. The similarity of the p(r) function of 1 wt % BSA + 5 mM C12TAB complexes with 1
wt % BSA demonstrates that 5 mM C12TAB is unable to perturb the native
structure of BSA because of insufficient hydrophobic force to form
micelles. The appearance of the second maximum of 1 wt % BSA + 10
mM C12TAB complexes suggests the micelle-like cluster formation. This
length scale as already mentioned is related to the correlation between
two nearest micelles in the cluster. Another interesting feature is
obtained from p(r) that the amplitude
of oscillation at the first bump increased with increasing surfactant
concentration, which reflects the occurrence of a better-defined micelle
structure or an increased concentration of free micelles in solution.
In addition, the cluster size decreases systematically with increasing
C12TAB concentration (see the values of Dmax in Table 1). Thus,
a higher surfactant to protein ratio enables the formation of the
smaller cluster. A similar trend is observed in the p(r) function of BSA–C14TAB and BSA–C16TAB
complexes. However, the second maximum appears in the p(r) even at the lowest added surfactant concentration
(ci = 5 mM) with C14TAB and C16TAB. This
is a clear indication of the micelle formation of 1 wt % BSA + 5 mM
CnTAB (n = 14 and 16) complexes.
At ci = 80 mM, the first maximum is raised
to the highest amplitude, whereas the second maximum is almost disappeared
in the p(r) function of BSA–CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and 16) complexes. The
disappearance of the second maximum suggests the change in the morphology
of the cluster. IFT fit of SANS data are presented in Figure S2 (Supporting Information).

The detailed modeling of SANS data obtained from BSA–CnTAB complexes at different concentrations is shown in Figure 2 (left). It is observed
that the scattering profiles of BSA–C10TAB complexes at the
concentrations ranging from 5 to 40 mM have behavior similar to that
of pure protein and confirmed by p(r) measurement of the scattering intensity (Figure 2A(ii)). The SANS profiles of BSA–C10TAB
clearly suggest the absence of the micellar structure in the sub-CAC
concentration range of C10TAB, and therefore, the native structure
of BSA remains unperturbed. The interparticle interaction is clearly
visible in the SANS data on further increasing the C10TAB concentration
(ci = 80 mM). Therefore, S(q) of the micelles organized in a cluster using
the random flight model along with P(q) of ellipsoidal core–shell micelles is employed to extract
the information from SANS data. The fitted parameters of the protein
with different tail-length surfactants are given in Table 1.

The scattering profile
of BSA–C12TAB complexes shows behavior
similar to that of native protein solution at ci = 5 mM. The scattering profiles of protein–surfactant
complexes above CAC (5.5 mM) of C12TAB have a completely different
feature to those below CAC. At ci = 10
mM, the linearity of the scattering profile in the intermediate-q range is increased, and a strong change in the scattering
profile in the low-q range is also observed. The
fitting of SANS data by a random flight model as described in eq 4 yields that as the number
of C12TAB molecules is increased, the micelles get elongated in one
direction and the axial ratio (ε) is also increased. On the
other hand, the thickness of the shell is decreased while the scattering
length density of the shell increased at higher C12TAB concentration.
With increasing the C12TAB concentration from 10 to 80 mM, the number
of micelles per cluster (NCLU) is decreased
from 13.5 to 1.2, clearly suggesting that the cluster is replaced
by a single elongated micelle. Following a similar trend, the number
of proteins per cluster is also decreased and finally reduced to ∼1
at a higher C12TAB concentration. By contrast, the distance between
the micelles is increased from 41 to 64 Å (see Table 1). At the beginning of the unfolding
process, micelles with an aggregation number of 63 C12TAB molecules
are formed, which jumped to 85 to stabilize the elongated micelle
at the final stage of the unfolding process. The present analysis
suggests that the beads-on-a-string-type structure disappeared at
a higher C12TAB concentration, and the protein molecules go through
a structural redistribution and wrap the single micelle through the
surface.

SANS data of 1 wt % BSA protein with increasing concentration
of
C14TAB and C16TAB ranging from 0 to 80 mM are shown in Figure 2C,D, respectively. The scattering
features of the BSA–CnTAB (n = 14 and 16) system at different concentrations significantly differ
from each other. Because of the very low CAC of C14TAB and C16TAB,
they have displayed strong hydrophobic interaction with BSA through
micelle formation. The concentration window, in which the protein–surfactant
interaction is totally electrostatic, is not observed for BSA–CnTAB (n = 14 and 16) complexes in the measured
concentration range. In fact, at the lowest added surfactant concentration
(5 mM), the scattering profile is already significantly different
from the native BSA structure. This suggests that the denaturation
of BSA starts at the lowest added concentration of C14TAB and C16TAB
(ci = 5 mM). The analysis depicts that
the micelle size, micellar anisotropy (ε), and the aggregation
number increased with increasing the surfactant concentration and
thus enhance the denaturation of BSA. In addition to that, the shell
thickness is decreased while the scattering length density of the
shell increased at higher C14TAB and C16TAB concentration. On the
other hand, the number of micelles per cluster (NCLU) and the number of proteins per cluster are decreased,
whereas the distance D increased with increasing
the surfactant concentration. Similar to the BSA–C12TAB system,
at the highest added concentration (ci = 80 mM) of C14TAB and C16TAB, the analysis yields the merging of
smaller micelles in the cluster to a single elongated micelle (NCLU = 1).

A very significant trend revealed
from this study is that with
increasing the tail length of the ionic surfactant, the hydrophobic
interaction of BSA–CnTAB complexes gets stronger,
and thus the protein is unfolded at lower concentrations of surfactants.
To draw a more detailed picture of the hydrophobic tail-length effect
in the protein–surfactant interaction, the SANS profile of
1 wt % BSA with 40 mM surfactants is compared in Figure 3. The scattering features of
BSA with different tail-length ionic surfactants are significantly
different from each other. The p(r) function of 1 wt % BSA + 40 mM C10TAB complexes has a behavior
similar to 1 wt % BSA. The second maximum which is related to the
micelle-like cluster formation is clearly missing in this system.
The SANS data of BSA with 40 mM C10TAB are interpreted as a site-specific
electrostatic binding of monomeric surfactant molecules on the oppositely
charged patches of BSA. It is observed that with increasing the hydrophobic
tail length, the amplitude of the first oscillation is increased and
its position is shifted to larger-r in the p(r) function (Figure 3B). This is an indication of the bigger micelle
structure formation by BSA with higher tail-length surfactants. The
increase in the micelle size is consistent with the position of high-q cutoff, which is shifted to lower-q value
with increasing the surfactant tail length. The appearance of the
second maximum at higher tail-length surfactants corresponds to the
micelles-decorated protein clusters. The number of micelles per cluster
and the distance between the micelles are compared to see the propensity
of protein unfolding with increasing hydrophobic tail-length of the
ionic surfactant (Figure 3C,D). At ci = 40 mM, the biggest
but least micelles are obtained for BSA–C16TAB complexes (Table 1). These results suggest
the higher propensity of the unfolding of C16TAB compared to other
surfactants. As the number of micelles per cluster is decreased more
rapidly, the distance between two micelles gets larger for BSA + 40
mM C16TAB complexes compared to others (Figure 3D). The higher aggregation number of C16TAB
in the protein–surfactant complexes is also responsible for
the higher propensity of unfolding by this surfactant. On the contrary,
the higher number of micelles with low aggregation number suggests
the weaker denaturation of BSA in the BSA–C12TAB complexes
compared to other systems having longer tail-length surfactants. These
results thus show that the hydrophobic interaction between the protein
and surfactants is enhanced with increasing the hydrophobic tail length
of ionic surfactants.

DLS is used to support the conclusions
from SANS for the BSA–CnTAB complexes. The
differences in the decay of the intensity
autocorrelation function g2(τ) are
related to the different diffusion coefficients of these systems.34 DLS data of 1 wt % BSA–CnTAB complexes at ci = 40 mM and 1 wt
% BSA with ci C16TAB (ci = 5–80 mM) are presented in Figure 4. The decay of the intensity
autocorrelation function of the native protein is faster compared
to BSA–CnTAB complexes except for n = 10. The superposition of intensity autocorrelation function
of BSA–C10TAB complexes with the native protein indicates that
no unfolding of BSA takes place in the presence of 40 mM C10TAB, which
is also observed from SANS. On the contrary, the slower decay of the
intensity correlation function of BSA–CnTAB
complexes (except n = 10) indicates micelles’
formation because of the strong hydrophobic interaction of the protein
and surfactants.9,35 The hydrodynamic radii are calculated
using the Stokes–Einstein relation presented in eq 5 (Table S1, Supporting Information). The increase in the hydrodynamic
size of protein–surfactant complexes supports the unfolding
of BSA being determined by the protein–surfactant hydrophobic
interaction. The hydrodynamic sizes obtained from the intensity autocorrelation
can be compared to the maximum dimension of the BSA–CnTAB complex derived from the p(r) function obtained by IFT. The trend observed from DLS
is in good agreement with the results obtained from SANS analysis
for the structural evolution of protein–surfactant complexes
with varying concentrations and tail lengths of the surfactant. DLS
data of 1 wt % BSA + ci C16TAB yields
that the size of protein–surfactant complexes is decreased
at higher surfactant concentrations (ci > 10 mM). SANS analysis shows that with increasing surfactant
concentration,
lesser micelles are formed, which might be the reason for smaller
sizes in DLS at higher surfactant concentrations. A similar trend
is also observed in the p(r) function
at higher surfactant concentrations (Figure 2). The DLS results of BSA–CnTAB (n = 10, 12, and 14) complexes at
different surfactant concentrations are presented in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).

2.2 Effect
of Mixed Surfactants: Refolding of
BSA Protein
It is observed that the interactions of BSA with
ionic and nonionic surfactants are dissimilar from each other. The
presence of ionic surfactants in the protein–surfactant complexes
electrostatically and hydrophobically interact with proteins and denature
its native structure. On the contrary, the nonionic surfactants do
not interact with the protein, whereas they form mixed micelles with
ionic surfactants through the hydrophobic interaction. In a recent
study, it is shown that the presence of nonionic C12E10 in the BSA–C12TAB
complexes reinforces the refolding of BSA.11 In another study, the pathway of nonionic surfactant-dependent refolding
of protein unfolded by the ionic surfactant has been introduced.13 In the present study, it is demonstrated that
in the protein–ionic surfactant complexes, the propensity of
the unfolding of protein can be modified through the hydrophobic interaction
by changing the hydrophobic tail length of the surfactant. The role
of a nonionic surfactant for refolding of unfolded protein with different
tail-length ionic surfactants is further examined. For this purpose,
ternary systems consisting of BSA, nonionic surfactant, C12E10, and
a series of ionic surfactants with different tail lengths are investigated.

(n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) in the presence of C12E10
with different concentrations are presented in Figure 5. The figure also shows p(r) of some of the selected concentrations of C12E10.
It is already shown that the presence of 40 mM C10TAB is unable to
denature the native structure of BSA. Therefore, the scattering features
of BSA–C10TAB complexes with C12E10 are defined by the sum
of the scattering contributions from pure protein and ionic–nonionic
surfactant mixed micelles. The argument is supported by the absence
of the second maximum in the p(r) function of 1 wt % BSA + 40 mM C10TAB + cni C12E10 (cni = 5–40 mM)
complexes. On the contrary, the scattering features obtained for BSA
with 40 mM CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and
16) and 5 mM C12E10 are different from the 1 wt % BSA + 40 mM C10TAB
+ 5 mM C12E10 system but similar to those of protein–ionic
surfactant systems. Above 5 mM concentration of C12E10, the scattering
features of protein with mixed surfactants are very different from
the unfolded protein–ionic surfactants complexes. Four possible
scenarios are considered for the interaction of BSA with the mixed
surfactant system. First, it is assumed that only the ionic surfactant
interacts with BSA, which leads to the formation of the ionic surfactant-induced
unfolded BSA that coexists with noninteracting nonionic micelles (model
1). Second, both ionic and nonionic surfactants interact with the
protein and yield mixed surfactant-induced protein unfolding (model
2). Third, the ionic surfactant-induced unfolded protein coexists
with the ionic–nonionic mixed surfactant micelles (model 3)
and finally, none of the surfactants interact with the protein and
the scattering profile becomes a sum of scattering contributions from
native BSA and mixed surfactants (model 4). The simulated data of
these four scenarios are presented in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).

Figure 5 (Left) SANS data of 1 wt % BSA with 40
mM CnTAB
(n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) with varying concentrations
of C12E10 and (right) pair distance distribution functions p(r) obtained from the fits of the experimental
data of native BSA, BSA with 40 mM CnTAB (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16), ionic–nonionic mixed micelles,
and BSA with ionic–nonionic mixed micelles.

At a lower concentration of C12E10 (cni = 5 mM), the analysis of SANS data and the calculated p(r) function show less BSA unfolding for
1 wt %
BSA + 40 mM CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and
16) + 5 mM C12E10 compared to the reference complexes [1 wt % BSA
+ 40 mM CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and 16)].
A fraction of ionic surfactants is extracted out from the protein–surfactant
complexes because of the hydrophobic interaction between the ionic
and nonionic surfactants, which reduces the propensity of unfolding.
Therefore, the coexistence of mixed micelles with unfolded protein
(model 3) gives good agreement between the measured scattering and
the constructed model. The hydrophobic interaction increases with
increasing the concentration of C12E10 in the protein–surfactant
complexes. The stronger hydrophobic force extracts more and more ionic
surfactants and results in the increasing of the number of micelles
in the cluster, whereas the size and the spacing between the micelles
decrease significantly (Figure 6). This is completely reverse to the case of protein unfolding,
where the number of micelles per cluster decreased and the micelle
spacing increased with increasing concentration of ionic surfactants.
At cni = 40 mM C12E10, the scattering
data fitted well to model 4, where the refolded BSA coexists with
mixed micelles of ionic and nonionic surfactants. The second maximum
in the p(r) function, which is related
to the formation of micelle-like complexes, disappeared in this concentration.
In contrast, the huge difference between the experimental data and
the constructed model rules out the possibility of noninteracting
nonionic micelles’ coexistence with ionic micelles-induced
unfolded protein and mixed surfactant-induced protein unfolding (model
1 and model 2).

micelles in the cluster for BSA + 40 mM CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and 16) + cni mM
C12E10 (cni = 0, 5, 10, and 20) complexes.

The second conclusion is that
irrespective of the tail length of
ionic surfactants, C12E10 changes them from interacting to noninteracting
with protein. The phenomena can be understood based on the competition
of electrostatic binding of the ionic surfactant with protein with
that of the hydrophobic interaction of the ionic surfactant with a
nonionic surfactant. At the initial stage of C12E10 addition, the
weak interaction of ionic and nonionic surfactant is unable to overcome
the electrostatic binding of BSA–ionic surfactants. However,
a significant fraction of ionic surfactants is extracted from the
protein–surfactant complexes. With increasing C12E10 concentration,
the hydrophobic interaction between ionic and nonionic surfactants
increased and above a certain concentration of the nonionic surfactant,
the hydrophobic interaction gets total control over the electrostatic
binding of ionic surfactants with protein. As a result of the dominance
of hydrophobic interaction over the electrostatic one, BSA regained
its native structure.

These scenarios are modeled through the
increasing number of micelles
per cluster, decreasing the separation between micelles and anisotropy
in the micelle structure (Figure 6). It is noteworthy that as the interaction between
the ionic and nonionic micelles gets stronger, the micellar shell
thickness is also increased. In contrast, the scattering length density
of the shell is decreased. It is observed that the pathway of refolding
of BSA consisting of different cationic surfactants is more or less
the same. However, the propensity of refolding significantly decreases
with the increase in the tail length of the ionic surfactant. C16TAB
shows the lowest refolding efficiency by combining with C12E10 compared
to other ionic surfactants because of its stronger interaction with
BSA protein. The analyses of SANS data of 1 wt % BSA + 40 mM CnTAB (n = 12, 14, and 16) + cni mM C12E10 (cni = 5, 10,
20, and 40) are given in Table 2.

The
refolding of unfolded BSA protein in the presence of nonionic
C12E10 is further confirmed by DLS measurements. Figure 7 shows the variation in the
intensity autocorrelation function with increasing concentration of
C12E10 in the BSA–C16TAB complexes. The intensity autocorrelation
function decays faster with increasing concentration of C12E10. At cni ≈ 120 mM of C12E10, the refolding
of BSA is completed and the intensity autocorrelation function exactly
overlapped with the autocorrelation function of the native BSA one.
This suggests the coexistence of refolded BSA with ionic and nonionic
surfactant mixed micelles in the system. The hydrodynamic diameter
of protein–surfactant complexes with increasing C12E10 concentration
is presented in the inset. The hydrodynamic size decreases with C12E10
up to 120 mM and thereafter remains constant and equal to that of
the folded protein. The effect of the addition of C12E10 to BSA–C12TAB
and BSA–C14TAB complexes is also found similar to that of BSA–C16TAB
(Figure S5, Supporting Information). It
is to be mentioned that the size of the ionic–nonionic surfactants’
mixed micelles is marginally smaller than the size of the native protein
(Figure S6, Supporting Information). Therefore,
it is really difficult to extract the contributions of individual
components by DLS.

Figure 7 DLS data of 1 wt % BSA and 20 mM C16TAB with varying concentrations
of C12E10. The inset shows the variation of the hydrodynamic radius
with the change in the concentration of C12E10.

The present study demonstrates the nonionic surfactant-dependent
refolding of ionic surfactant-induced unfolded protein through mixed
micelles formation. The combined study of SANS and DLS in BSA protein
unfolding and refolding experiments allows us to probe the overall
features of the protein. In general, the transitions from folding
to unfolding and back to refolding are reversible and easy to follow.
The ability to refold BSA at a low concentration of C12E10 to form
micelle-free structures demonstrates the advantage of transferring
CnTAB (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) molecules
into mixed micelles with a very favorable mixing entropy. This clearly
indicates that BSA proteins are not kinetically trapped in the unfolded
state. The redistribution of cationic surfactants into mixed micelles
with the nonionic surfactant makes it possible to withdraw sufficient
amounts of CnTAB (n = 10, 12, 14,
and 16) from the complexes to allow the proteins to refold back.

3 Conclusions
The emerging perspective from
the current study is that the unfolding
and refolding of BSA protein can be controlled by the hydrophobic
interaction between protein and surfactants via changing the hydrophobic
tail length of the ionic surfactant. The anionic protein interacts
differently with cationic and nonionic surfactants. The ionic surfactant
binds to the protein by site-specific electrostatic interaction and
forms beads-on-a-string chain-like complexes along the unfolded peptide
chain of protein. With increasing hydrophobic tail length of the ionic
surfactant, the BSA protein unfolds even at lower concentrations through
the micelle formation, which reveals that the propensity of BSA unfolding
increases with increasing the hydrophobic tail length of the ionic
surfactant. It is noteworthy that the addition of a nonionic surfactant
results in folding back of the unfolded protein. The interplay of
the hydrophobic interaction of mixed surfactants with the electrostatic
interaction of the ionic surfactant and the protein determines the
pathway of the refolding process. It is easier to overcome the interaction
of BSA with shorter tail length ionic surfactants by adding nonionic
C12E10 because of their weaker interaction. This implies that the
propensity of refolding decreases with increasing the hydrophobic
tail length of the ionic surfactant. The present study thus shows
that it is possible to regulate the unfolding and refolding of BSA
by changing the hydrophobic tail length of the ionic surfactant. The
idea remains to be consolidated by more extensive future studies with
a series of nonionic surfactants with different carbon chains as well
as multimeric proteins.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
BSA with 99% purity was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without any purification. The
received protein was a lyophilized powder with the molecular weight
of ∼66 kDa. Cationic C10TAB, C12TAB, C14TAB, C16TAB, and nonionic
C12E10 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Samples were prepared in
D2O (99.9 atom % D) to ensure sufficient contrast for SANS
experiments,36 whereas they were prepared
in H2O for DLS measurements. In the first step, the individual
components (BSA and ionic and nonionic surfactants) were dissolved
in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH = 7.0. They were kept at room temperature
overnight to allow them to mix properly. For the unfolding study,
the measurements were carried out for a fixed concentration of protein
(1 wt %) and varying concentrations of surfactants (ci) in the range of 0–80 mM. The tail length of
CnTAB was varied from n = 10 to
16. For the refolding study, the C12E10 concentration (cni) was varied from 0 to 40 mM while keeping the BSA and
ionic surfactant contents fixed. In the first step of sample preparation,
the stock solution of the ionic surfactant was mixed with the protein
solution to denature the protein. In the next step, the stock solution
of the nonionic surfactant was added to the protein–ionic surfactant
complexes to refold back the unfolded protein.

4.2 Small-Angle
Neutron Scattering
SANS
experiments were carried out on the SANS-I facility at the Swiss Spallation
Neutron Source SINQ, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland.37 All the measurements were performed at λ
= 8 Å and the wavelength resolution (Δλ/λ)
was about 10%. Samples were put in a 2 mm HELLMA quartz cuvette and
aligned using the thermostatic sample holder with a fixed temperature
of 25 °C. A two-dimensional (96 × 96 cm2) 3He gas detector was used to detect the scattered neutrons.
Two sample-to-detector distances of 2 and 8 m were used to cover the q-range from 0.007 to 0.30 Å–1. The
raw data were radially averaged, corrected for electronic background
and empty cell, and normalized by water scattering using the BerSANS
software.38

In the first step of
data treatment, an IFT is applied to the scattering data to obtain
some model-independent information of the scattering objects in the
real space.39 The IFT of scattering data
yields a pair distance correlation function (p(r)), which provides the information about particle shape,
the radius of gyration (Rg), and the maximum
size Dmax of the scattering objects (p(r) goes to zero at r = Dmax). In the next step, a model for
protein–surfactant complexes is constructed depending on the
result obtained from the IFT of scattering data. A model for a beads-on-a-string chain is adapted for
the surfactant-induced denaturation process of BSA protein. According
to this model, the micelles are organized in clusters, which constitute
a random flight string of polypeptide chain with a fixed step size
between the centers of micelles.22

In general, the differential scattering cross section per unit
volume (dΣ/dΩ) as a function of q for
monodisperse interacting particles is given by 1  where Np is the
particle number density, P(q) and S(q) are the form factor and structure
factor, respectively, and B is the incoherent background
arising mainly because of the presence of hydrogen in different components. P(q), the form factor of a micelle, is
assumed to be a prolate ellipsoidal core–shell structure. P(q) of the prolate ellipsoidal core–shell
particle with semiminor axis R, axial anisotropy
ε, and thickness t can be written as 2  where  with , , and  where ρc, ρshell, and ρs are, respectively, the scattering
length densities of the particle core, shell, and solvent. V1 (=4πεR3/3) and V2 (=4πε(R + t)3/3) are the volumes of
the core and the core along with the shell, respectively. β
is the angle between the directions of the semimajor axis and wave
vector transfer and j1(x) is a first-order spherical Bessel function.

The structure
factor of the random flight model with a constant
step size can be expressed as40 3  Here, NCLU is
the random flight steps or particularly the number of micelles per
cluster and D is the step size or the distance between
the centers of two micelles. NCLU is calculated
in the same way as mentioned by Giehm et al.22 as the weighted linear combination [NCLU] and [NCLU] + 1, with the [NCLU] largest integer smaller than NCLU.

By combining eqs 1–3 and using the decoupling
approximation,
the differential scattering cross section per unit volume (dΣ/dΩ)
for micelles with random flight structure can be expressed as31 4  where Nmic is
the number density of micelles and calculated by Nmic = NA × (Ctot – CCAC)/Nagg. NA is the Avogadro
number, Ctot is the total surfactant concentration,
and CCAC is the CAC of the surfactant. Nagg is the aggregation number of the micelle
and determined by ratio of the volumes of the micellar core to the
tail length of the surfactant. The volume of the tail length of the
surfactant is calculated from Tanford’s formula.41 CAC is an important parameter to get the exact
number of micelles formed by the protein–surfactant complexes,
which is determined by the DLS measurement.15 The concentration below CAC is assumed not to participate in the
micelle formation. The information about the micelle size (R), axial anisotropy in the size of the micelle (ε),
thickness (t) of the micelle shell, and scattering
length density of the shell (ρshell) are extracted
from the P(q) of SANS data fitting.
The scattering length density of core ρc is taken
as the scattering length density of the hydrophobic tail of ionic
surfactants (−0.23 × 1010 cm–2), and ρs is the scattering length density of D2O (6.37 × 1010 cm–2). The
independence of the fitted parameters is verified by the fitting of q-dependence of data and comparing scattering intensity
on the absolute unit. The fitting of SANS data by the random flight
structure factor gives the information about the number of micelles
per cluster (NCLU) and separation between
two nearest micelles (D). The number of proteins
per micelle (Nprot/mic) is calculated
from the known protein concentration divided by Nmic. The product of the number of proteins per micelle
and NCLU yields the number of proteins
per cluster. All the data were fitted using SASfit analysis software.42

4.3 Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS experiments
were carried out using an SZ-100 particle size analyzer (HORIBA, Japan)
at a wavelength of 532 nm. The scattering angle was kept fixed at
173° during the measurements. All the samples used for DLS measurement
were dispersed in H2O and measured without dilution. The
backscatter detection ensures the minimization of any contamination
from dust particles and multiple scattering from the sample. The DLS
measures the temporal fluctuation in scattering light intensity at
a specific angle using a monochromatic light. The signal generated
by diffusing particles can be analyzed by the intensity autocorrelation
function. The diffusion coefficient (Da) and polydispersity index are calculated using the cumulant analysis
method. The effective hydrodynamic size (dh) is calculated from Da using the Stoke–Einstein
equation35 5  where kB is Boltzmann’s
constant, η is the viscosity of the solvent, and T is the absolute temperature. The details of DLS theory are presented
in the Supporting Information.
