In the last decade,
researchers have been searching for innovative
platforms, methods, and techniques able to address recurring problems
with the current cancer detection methods. Early disease detection,
fast results, point-of-care sensing, and cost are among the most prevalent
issues that need further exploration in this field. Herein, studies
are focused on overcoming these problems by developing an electrochemical
device able to detect telomerase as a cancer biomarker. Electrochemical
platforms and techniques are more appealing for cancer detection,
offering lower costs than the established cancer detection methods,
high sensitivity inherent to the technique, rapid signal processing,
and their capacity of being miniaturized. Therefore, Au interdigital
electrodes and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to
detect telomerase activity in acute T cell leukemia. Different cancer
cell concentrations were evaluated, and a detection limit of 1.9 ×
105 cells/mL was obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
was used to characterize the telomerase substrate (TS) DNA probe self-assembled
monolayer on gold electrode surfaces. Atomic force microscopy displayed
three-dimensional images of the surface to establish a height difference
of 9.0 nm between the bare electrode and TS-modified Au electrodes.
The TS probe is rich in guanines, thus forming secondary structures
known as G-quadruplex that can be triggered with a fluorescence probe.
Confocal microscopy fluorescence images showed the formation of DNA
G-quadruplex because of TS elongation by telomerase on the Au electrode
surface. Moreover, electrodes exposed to telomerase containing 2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate
(ddGTP) did not exhibit high fluorescence, as ddGTP is a telomerase
inhibitor, thus making this device suitable for telomerase inhibitors
capacity studies. The electrochemical method and Au microchip device
may be developed as a biosensor for a point-of-care medical
device.

==== Body
Introduction
The development of
microchips or electrochemical devices to detect
and monitor diseases has been well studied and implemented in recent
years. These electrochemical platforms are modified with biomolecules
to guaranty fast and efficient detection of a specific analyte, target,
or biomarker; offering additional advantages in terms of cost and
lab-on-a-chip technology. For example, development of electrochemical
devices that monitor glucose levels,1 detect
cardiac attacks,2 viral3 and bacterial infections,4 and
cancer,5 among other diseases, has been
reported in the literature. Intriguingly, the development of biosensors
that detect cancer has been one of the most challenging because of
the complexity of the disease. As a critical matter, in the Review
of Antimicrobial Resistance, for 2050, O’Neill projected 8.2
million diseases each year.6 This alarming
number can be changed by ensuring the success of cancer treatment
regularly achieved with early disease detection.7,8 Therefore,
there is a need of low-cost devices that detect early stages of these
lethal diseases in a fast and efficient way.

In prior efforts,
biomarkers have played an important role in cancer
research.9−12 Telomerase activity serves as a cancer biomarker because it is responsible
for the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells in 80–90% of cancers.13,14 This enzyme is a ribonucleoprotein complex that synthesizes telomeres
at the end of the chromosomal DNA, avoiding them to reach the Hayflick
limit (maximum number of cell division) and thus cell apoptosis.15 Telomerase uses its components, the RNA matrix
(TR) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), to perform telomerase
substrate (TS) elongation. The structure of the catalytic subunit
of telomerase bound to its RNA template and the telomeric DNA has
a diameter of 10.6 nm.16 In addition, telomerase
needs deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) to synthesize the
telomere. If the nature of the nucleotides is changed, the enzyme
activity is affected. As it has been previously reported, the nucleotide
2′,3′-dideoxyguanosine-5′-triphosphate (ddGTP)
is one of the molecules that have a better potential to inhibit telomerase
activity.17 This type of inhibitor acts
on TERT by stopping the telomere elongation because of the absence
of the 3′-hydroxyl group (compared with the deoxyribonucleotide,
dGTP). Telomerase inactivation is important because of its impact
in cancer therapy.18 The implementation
of this antitelomerase therapy has been challenging. Until 2016, just
two antitelomerase drugs were used in clinical trials.19 Therefore, identification of new substances
for cancer therapy and methods to determine their capacity are needed.

Currently, the assay used to detect telomerase activity in biological
samples is the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay, commercially
called TRAPeze. This biological test cannot be miniaturized, is time-consuming,
not sensitive, expensive, and requires careful handling.20,21 Opportunely, in the last years, few electrochemical studies have
achieved telomerase detection using its recognition biomolecule, DNA
(TS probe or telomere sequence).21−24

Telomere-modified electrodes
have been used to detect telomerase
activity.25−28 Since 1994, telomerase activity has been associated with cancer
cells.29 Cancers such as breast,30 colorectal,31 bladder,32 cervical,33 leukemia,33 ovarian,34 among
others, have shown high telomerase activity; thus, it has become a
common biomarker for these types of cancers. Recently, a detection
method for circulating tumor cells, using the telomerase-specific
adenovirus OBP-401, has been presented.35 The development of electrochemical biosensors has been driven by
considerable efforts in cancer sensing and monitoring.36,37 In spite of all achievements, it is still necessary to develop an
electrochemical platform that can be implemented as a medical device.

Common DNA sensors are based on the correlation between surface
modifications and the changes in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements.22−24,38 EIS provides advantages
in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, and fast response.39 EIS is usually combined with surface analysis
techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic
force microscopy (AFM) to characterize these sensors.40,41 Additionally, fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy
are the techniques that can identify nucleic acid secondary structures.42−44 As the telomere repeat sequence is rich in guanine, a large fragment
of this DNA forms a G-quadruplex. This secondary structure can intercalate
positively charged electrochemical indicators, cationic porphyrins,
and/or fluorescent dyes, allowing its detection by the spectroscopic
techniques mentioned above.45−47

Previous research by our
group has described the use of label-free/nonfaradaic
methods to sense DNA hybridization, but this innovative report extends
it to miniaturized sensors. Rivera-Gandía et al.48 managed to detect the double-layer capacitance
of self-assembled monolayer hairpin probes before and after exposure
to complementary strands at two distinct potentials: zero charge potential
(PZC) and a higher potential to PZC. They noted that the ssDNA hairpin
showed a lower Cdl, whereas dsDNA showed
a higher Cdl at an applied potential versus
PZC. On the other hand, our group has worked with DNA sensors based
on single-wall carbon nanotube-modified Au surfaces using label-free
EIS.41,49 Recently, Cunci et al.23 were able to develop this concept further by looking at
DNA elongation in the presence of telomerase in a custom-made Au interdigital
electrode device. Currently, our research group is focused on the
development of an in situ, label-free, cost-effective, and less time-consuming
DNA biosensor that can detect telomerase activity in Jurkar T-lymphoblastic
leukemia cells. These cancer cells are responsible for acute lymphocytic
leukemia, the most common cancer in children.50 In this work, a label-free electrochemical sensor for telomerase
activity detection in real time, using an already scaled-up fabricated
and disposable Au interdigital platform, was developed. Moreover,
the investigation of TS modification on the electrode surface and
the presence of enzyme in nuclear protein extraction is done by surface
analysis and biochemical techniques, respectively. To the best of
the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that the telomerase
inhibitor capacity is studied by label-free EIS. Others have used
this electrochemical technique to measure telomerase activity, however,
employing [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– as the redox probe in the supporting electrolyte solution.22 Additionally, this is the first time that TS
elongation process on a surface is confirmed using confocal microscopy.
The methods and equipment developed by our group in this and previous
investigations are promising tools that hopefully merge in the development
of a lab-on-a-chip technology that could be used at a point-of-care
location.

Results and Discussion
Surface Analysis
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Comparing the XPS
binding energy spectra obtained (Figure 1a–d) for the bare Au electrode and
for the TS probe-modified electrode, a decrease in Au 4f binding energy
peak intensity was observed because of the attachment of TS30 to the
Au electrode surface (Figure 1a). This is due to the reduction of the Au sites exposed to
the surface.51 Moreover, DNA characteristic
XPS peaks were identified. Specifically, when thiol (S) on the 5′-terminal
of the TS30 probe was immobilized forming a self-assembled monolayer
on the Au electrode surface, a wide S 2p peak (from around 162 to
164 eV) appeared on the XPS spectra (Figure 1b).52 This is
due to the formation of Au–S-DNA interaction and the remaining
unbound sulfur possibly generated with the reduction of the disulfide
bonds. Furthermore, N 1s and P 2p XPS peaks (Figure 1c,d) were observed, confirming the presence
of the TS probe as phosphorus and nitrogen are the main components
of the DNA structure. Therefore, the Au microchip surface modification,
with the TS probe, was confirmed.

and DNA-modified (dashed
line, Au-TS) Au electrodes for (a) Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 (b) S 2p, (c) P 2p, and (d) N 1s binding energy regions.

Atomic Force Microscopy
The AFM image of the bare Au
electrode (Figure 2a) showed a minor surface height than the one of TS30-modified Au
electrode (Figure 2b). This change in height is due to the formation of DNA self-assembled
monolayers.53 Particularly, the roughness
factor (Rq) or the standard deviation
of the height attained for the bare electrode was 50 nm and for that
for the modified Au electrode was 59 nm. This 9.0 nm height difference
is attributed to the arrangement of the TS probe on the Au electrode
surface that has a length of approximately 9.24 nm (CalcTool: DNA
Strand Length Calculator). This tool assumes 3.3 Å as the distance
between the nucleotides.

Au electrodes.

Electrochemical Analysis
Biosensor
Characterization
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
technique was employed to characterize the immobilization of the TS30
probe at the Au microchip surface. Figure 3a shows the voltammograms of the bare and
TS30 probe-modified Au electrode surfaces in 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) at pH 7.0. A notable current decrease in the cathodic
and anodic peaks occurs because the immobilization of ssDNA blocks
the electron transfer, forming a barrier.22−24 Clarifying,
the increased negative charge produced by the DNA probe hinders the
charge transfer to the negatively charged redox molecules in solution.
This causes a change in the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) measured using EIS because of its sensitivity (Figure 3b). As anticipated,
the charge-transfer resistance increased with Au surface modification
with the TS30 probe. The TS30 immobilization at the Au microchip was
electrochemically confirmed. Au microchip exposition to enzyme extracts
was followed.

(solid
line, Au) and DNA-modified (dashed line, Au-TS) electrodes.

Electrochemical Telomerase
Detection
EIS was used as
a sensing technique for telomerase in situ detection. To achieve a
label-free detection, electroactive molecules contained in buffer
C and in the nuclear extract (Supporting Information, Figure S1) were used, avoiding the use of the redox couple additive. Figure 4a showed changes
in the charge-transfer resistance ((Rct(telo) – Rct(DNA))/Rct(DNA) or ΔR) for different extract
concentration solutions and heated extract fraction (negative control)
at various incubation times. The charge-transfer resistance was obtained
performing a fitting for the equivalent electrical circuit model (R1 + Q2/R2).

(E) heated extract.

Enzyme-assisted telomere
elongation process is not instantaneous;
it takes time for the enzyme to bind to the telomeres, synthesize
it, relocate, and continue with replication.10 The elongation process was studied by changing the reaction time,
and substantial changes in ΔR were observed,
as shown in Figure 4a. At 0 min of exposure, there was no change for any concentration.
On the other hand, more incubation time means synthesis of more telomere
units, compacting the surface, resulting in an impedance increase.
Generally, each concentration studied displayed an increase in ΔR as the enzymatic reaction time increased. Variations in
the impedance are attributed to the possibility of DNA nonspecific
adsorption and the interference of other nuclear extract residues.

Time study also showed a change, after 30 min, but for small concentrations,
overlapping was observed. This result is in accordance with that of
Cunci et al. in which they reported that for the Jurkat nuclear extract,
20 min was enough time to observe a quantitatively different change
in label-free impedance measurements.23 Therefore, using the presented system, 30 min is enough time to
make qualitative telomerase detection. Other modification times, 60,
120, and 180 min, showed more differences in ΔR, 3 h being the most accurate modification time for fundamental analysis.

Additionally, the change in ΔR for all the
extract samples increased as the enzyme concentration increased. This
occurs because more telomerase is able to synthesize DNA bases on
the telomere-modified electrode surface contributing to the obstruction
of the electron-transfer kinetics. As expected, there was no significant
variation in ΔR for the electrodes incubated
with negative control (heated extract). The detection limit attained
from this calibration curve was 1.9 × 105 cells/mL.
The detection limit was calculated according to the 3Snc/m criterion, where m is the slope of the linear range of the respective calibration curve
(Supporting Information, Figure S2) and Snc is the standard deviation of the negative
control. To the best the of the authors’ knowledge, there is
no other EIS calibration curve for the nuclear extract of cancer samples
to target telomerase, as reported in the literature.

Using Figure 4a
data, ΔR/Δt for each
cell concentration was obtained to acquire Figure 4b. As the cell concentration is raised, the
related time sensitivity of detection increases. Therefore, telomerase
activity was detected in a reliable way.

The nucleotide effect
on telomerase activity was also evaluated
in this study. Figure 5 shows the results for different extract solutions; when dNTPs are
added to the extract or telomerase solution, an increase in ΔR and sensitivity is observed. Moreover, to confirm the
reliability of the sensor, immobilization studies of the enzyme in
the presence of the inhibitor nucleotide, ddGTP, were done. The observed
results indicate a decrease in ΔR. This finding
could be attributed to the possibility of an elongation process that
is hampered when ddGTP is incorporated, thus, preventing the addition
of further nucleotides.54

resistance (R)

Nuclear Extraction: Western
Blot
Immunoblotting analysis
confirmed the presence of telomerase in the commercial positive control
(Supporting Information, Figure S3a) and
in the Jurkat nuclear cell protein extraction (Figure S3b) using Anti-hTERT antibody. The difference in signal
intensity is attributed to the variations in telomerase concentration
for these two samples. Detectable telomerase in the nuclear extract
cytoplasmic fraction (Figure S3c) was not
found, suggesting that telomerase is mostly present in the nuclei.
GAPDH was used as a positive control, as it is a protein that can
be found in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Collectively, the
results demonstrated the presence of telomerase in the nuclear protein
extracts that were used for electrochemical assays.

G-Quadruplex
Formation: Emission Spectroscopy
Telomerase
fluorescent light-up probes have been presented in the literature
recently.32,44,55−57 This type of mechanism was used to confirm the formation of G-quadruplex
structures in our systems by emission spectroscopy. Organic and/or
pyridine (Py)-based molecules have been used to aim fluorescence in
biological samples by aggregation-induced emission effect.56,57 Therefore, TMPyP4 was used as a ligand to intercalate in the G-quadruplex,
thus acting as a fluorescence probe. Figure S4 shows two fluorescence peaks around 655 and 720 nm for TS30 and
TS60; according to the literature, they are formed due to the splitting
of the broad fluorescence band of the ligand.42 As expected, the spectra for the TS complementary probe (TSC; do
not contain guanines) showed one broad peak (TMPyP4 fluorescence peak),
suggesting that the intercalation did not occur. To confirm these
results, fluorescence spectra for TS30, TSC, TS60 without TMPyP4 intercalation,
and TMPyP4 itself were obtained (Supporting Information, Figure S4). Peaks for TS probes were not observed because there
was no intercalation and thus no fluorescence emission. In TMPyP4
itself, the spectra show a broad fluorescence peak.

Confocal
Microscopy
Confocal microscopy fluorescence
was used to confirm the formation of TS G-quadruplex on the Au/TS30
electrode surface after being exposed to telomerase. Figure 6a corresponds to the Au electrode
modified with the TS30 probe. Here, fluorescence of thiazole orange
(TO) was not visible because the number of bases contained in the
TS30 probe is not enough to achieve a noticeable TO intercalation
[mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) = 94.35]. However, a TO MIF of
261 was observed when the TS30 probe was elongated and G-quadruplex
was formed on the electrode surface (see Figure 6b). This phenomenon was expected because
according to Zhuang et al. TS fluorescence increases as the telomerase
concentration increases.32 In this direction, Figure 6b shows that compact
modification of TS and the immobilization of the enzyme occur uniformly
on the Au electrode surface. TO intercalation was confirmed using
a larger TS probe (TS60) that, as can be observed in Figure 6c, exhibited a slightly more
fluorescence than TS30 (MFI = 123). On the other hand, as expected,
when the nature of the nucleotides (dNTPs) was changed, the enzyme
activity was affected. Consequently, a less MFI (157) was observed
when the TS30 electrode was exposed to the nuclear extract with ddGTP
(Figure 6d). The negative
control (Figure 6e)
showed a slight fluorescence, probably because of the interaction
of the 30 base probes with the extract components (MFI = 121).

Figure 6 Confocal microscope
images of the modified device with (a) TS30
(mean intensity fluorescence (MIF): 94), (b) after 3 h incubation
with telomerase and dNTPs (MIF: 261), (c) TS60 (MIF: 123), (d) TS-30
after 3 h incubation with telomerase and ddGTPs (MIF: 157), (e) TS30
after 3 h incubation with negative control and dNTPs (MIF: 121).

A closer look into the images
show a few noticeable dots (spots)
of high fluorescence. This may be because of the nonspecifically absorbed
residues of the nuclear extract (DNA and nuclear proteins) on the
gold electrode surface that intercalate TO. In summary, the TS G-quadruplex
structures were identified using confocal microscopy, confirming that
the elongation process happens on the electrode surface. These results
are in excellent agreement with the biosensor response, which show
differences in ΔR; both are attributed to the
telomerase-assisted DNA elongation.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, the presence of telomerase in the nuclear protein
extract of acute T leukemia cells using biochemical and electrochemical
techniques was confirmed. To the best of authors’ knowledge,
this is the first time that confocal microscopy is used to confirm
the formation of G-quadruplex on an electrode surface after telomerase
exposure. Moreover, specific telomerase label-free detection in real
time was achieved using an electrochemical platform and EIS technique.
Additionally, the developed telomerase activity-sensing microchip
can be used to test the telomerase inhibitor capacity. This biosensor
device offers several advantages over the existing technologies such
as robustness, low cost, disposability, flexibility, compactness,
and is less complicated than the existing technologies for telomerase
detection. Enhancement of the sensitivity and clinical trial implementation
should be the next steps for this system. All these features can have
a tremendous impact on biomedical science as it will fill the existing
gap of methods that can detect telomerase activity in a direct readout
at the point-of-care location.

Biosensor Construction
The disposable interdigital
Au electrode microstrips were modified following the steps shown in Figure 7. First, 1 μM
TS30 was dissolved in an immobilization buffer (I-buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl,
0.1 M NaCl, and 10 μM TCEP at pH 7.5) and incubated for 30 min
at room temperature to reduce the disulfide bonds. Then, 10 μL
of the reduced TS30 solution was placed on a cleaned microchip strip
overnight (Supporting Information, Figure
S5) at 4 °C. Finally, the sensing strip was carefully washed
with Nanopure water and 0.05% SDS for 5 min to desorb nonspecific
adsorptions and dried with N2. Nanopure water is treated
with DCEP and autoclaved to inactivate RNase and DNase enzymes.

elongation process at Au interdigital electrodes.

Surface Analysis
XPS was done using a PHI 5600ci spectrometer
with an Al K X-ray source at 15 kV and 350 W. The pass energy used
was 187.85 eV for the survey analysis and 58.7 eV for the high-resolution
studies. Binding energies were corrected with respect to the aliphatic
hydrocarbon C 1s binding energy signal at 285.0 eV. A Nanoscope IIIa-Multimode
atomic force microscope from Digital Instruments, with a scanning
probe microscope controller equipped with a He–Ne laser (638.2
nm) and a type E scanner, was used for the AFM analysis. All samples
were analyzed in tapping mode using a phosphorous-doped Si cantilever
from Veeco Instrument, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA).

Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical measurements
were done using a BioLogic Science Instruments VMP3 model. The Au
microchip surface was electrochemically cleaned by cycling between
a 0 and 1.5 V versus Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M sulfuric acid solution at a
scan rate of 100 mV s–1 until a reproducible cyclic
voltammogram was obtained. CV was done in a solution of 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 in 0.1
M PBS at pH 7.0 from −0.3 to 0.3 V versus an open-circuit potential
(OCP) at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. EIS experiments
for the characterization of the Au microchip surface were performed
from 1 × 106 to 0.1 Hz, taking 40 measurements in
logarithmic scale, with an amplitude of 10 mV at 0 V versus OCP. EIS
experiments to detect telomerase in cancer cells were performed from
2 × 105 to 0.1 Hz taking 40 measurements in logarithmic
scale, with an amplitude of 10 mV at 0 V versus OCP every 5 min for
3 h. CV was done every hour from −0.3 to 0.3 mV versus OPC
at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 to remove nonspecific
absorptions of molecules from the remaining extract. During the experiment,
the microchip was incubated for 3 h in an Eppendorf Thermomixer C
to keep the temperature at 37 °C with the desired extract sample
supplemented with 0.2 mM dNTPs or ddGTPs.

Cell Culture and Nuclear
Extraction
Jurkat T Cells
(from the American Type Culture Collection of Manassas, VA, USA) were
incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic
that consisted of 100 units/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin,
and 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B. Nuclear cell extraction was performed
following an established protocol.23 Briefly,
cells were collected in the exponential phase of growth and washed
twice with ice-cold PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4). Then, the
pellet was resuspended in buffer A [10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM protein-sparing modified fast
(PMSF)], incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm
for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, buffer A was added to the cell pellet
and lysed in a cold 7 mL Dounce homogenizer (Kontes). The lysate was
centrifuged at 6500 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C to separate the nuclei
from the cytoplasm. The pellet (nuclei) was then resuspended in buffer
C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.05, 0.42 M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1.5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 1 mM PSMF) and placed under ultrasound
six times for 10 s at maximum power. The nuclear fraction was centrifuged
at 15 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Finally, the nuclear
fraction (supernatant) was stored at −80 °C. The reproducibility
of the extraction protocol was confirmed by obtaining the average
protein concentration of 3118 ± 147 μg/mL for different
extractions. Negative controls were obtained by heating the samples
for 30 min at 100 °C.

Western Blot
Nuclear and cytoplasmic
cell fractions
were concentrated using centrifugal filter units. Approximately 40
μg of proteins was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis using a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred
onto a 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes
were cut into segments to allow immunoblotting with different antibodies.
After blocking in Tris buffered saline containing 10% nonfat milk
and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature, the blots were
incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution with an appropriate
dilution of the primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies
were used: antitelomerase reverse transcriptase antibody (rabbit polyclonal,
ab191523; dilution 1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and anti-GAPDH
antibody GA1R (mouse monoclonal, ab125247; dilution 1:1000; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). The blots were then washed three times for 5
min each in TBS-T and then incubated with the appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.
The following secondary antibodies were used: goat antirabbit IgG
H&L (HRP) (ab205718; dilution 1:10000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
and goat antimouse IgG H&L (HRP) (12349; dilution 1:10000, EMD
Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). As positive control, Jurkat whole cell
lysate (ab30128; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used. After incubation
with the secondary antibodies, the blots were again washed three times
for 5 min with TBS-T, and the protein–antibody complexes were
detected by WesternBright Sirus (K-12043-C20; Advansta, Menio Park,
CA, USA) and visualized on a UVP Biospectrum Motorized Darkroom (Upland,
CA, USA).

Emission Spectroscopy
To assess the formation of TS30,
TS60, and TSC G-quadruplex and their binding affinity for the TMPyP4
solution (Tosylate ab120793; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), fluorescence
emission spectra were collected using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro Microplate
Reader, from 550 to 800 nm in energy wavelength. The 1 μM TMPyP4
solution was excited at 433 nm in the presence of 1 μM TS30,
TS60, and TSC in buffer C. As negative control, the emission spectra
of the ssDNA probes were collected without the TMPyP4 ligand.

Confocal
Microscopy
Images were collected on a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon A1 confocal
laser microscope system. First, modified biosensor Au microchips with
TS30 and TS60 were incubated with Jurkat nuclear cell fractions (5
× 105 cells/mL) with 0.2 mM of dNTPs or ddGTPs for
3 h at 37 °C to initiate the elongation process. Then, these
sensor microchips were incubated in 10 μM TO solution for 1
h at room temperature. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 485
and 520 nm, respectively, were used to visualize the fluorescence.
As negative control, we used the treated nuclear cell fraction.
