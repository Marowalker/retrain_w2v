The
main aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in
vivo efficiency of the polyaspartic acid- and acrylic acid-based superabsorbent
polymer. The synthesized polymer was first investigated to check the
blood compatibility by protein adsorption and blood clotting tests.
Further, the GHK-Cu peptide was incorporated within the polymer and
release studies were performed to evaluate the drug-delivery efficiency
of the superabsorbent polymer. The polymer with best peptide release
results were further used for in vivo analysis for wound healing.
The healing efficiency of polymer with and without peptide was analyzed
using wound closure, biochemical assay, histopathological, and toxicity
studies.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Human
body has strong immune system with self-healing ability.
The skin protects the body from the external environment.1 Wound healing is an active process that comes
in action once the protective barrier is broken.2 Severe burns and associated wounds can cause pathological
stress response and also large scars influencing patient’s
life.3 Different levels of burns require
different care and attention; for example, firstdegree burns, also
known as superficial burns, cause minimum damage.4,5 They
are usually treated with homemade remedies and require less healing
time. Second- and third-degree burns are severe and carry the most
risk for compilation such as infection and blood loss, resulting in
chronic wounds.6,7 Wound management has gained importance
in recent years. The healing techniques have improved over time. Modern
healing techniques overshadow the traditional methods. In the early
1980s, the traditional wound care products involved like gauze, cotton,
and sponge, which were replaced with advanced wound care products
like bioactive materials after 2000.8 These
materials posses an active component which delivers during wound healing.
The main property of bioactive material is their ability to combat
bacterial infections, which promoted wound healing. These severe burn
wounds are treated with different biomaterials like hydrogels, superabsorbent
polymer (SAP), scaffolds, and skin grafting.9−11

Superabsorbent
polymers are three-dimensional cross-linked polymeric
chains with high fluid absorption capacity.12 These special absorbing materials are used in a variety of applications
ranging from personal hygiene products and agriculture to tissue engineering
and other biomedical products.13 Due to
these applications, these polymers are now being used in the medical
field, including wound healing. Global SAP market size was estimated
at 2.07 million tons in 2014 and is projected to exceed 3.1 million
by 2023.

The majority of synthesized SAPs are based on petroleum-based
monomers
like acrylic and acrylamide because of good mechanical strength and
absorption property.14 The drawback of
using this kind of monomer is that they lack biocompatibility and
biodegradability. Thus, scientists today have changed their focus
from synthetic SAPs to bio-based SAPs synthesized from starch, cellulose,
natural gums, chitin, chitosan, alginates, and polyaminoacids.15−18 Bio-based SAP provides environmentally sustainable alternatives
to fossil-based material. These biopolymers are potent applicants
for synthesizing biocompatible polymers but lack mechanical and absorption
properties. Natural polymers are like poly(amino acids), polysaccharides,
and protein have been known to exhibit biochemical and biological
properties.19,20 Poly(amino acids) can serve as
an alternate to petroleum-derived polymers because of their biocompatibility
and biodegradability. Different poly(amino acids), namely, polyaspartic
acid (PASP), polyglutamic acid, and poly(lysine) are widely being
studied, resulting in bioactive polypeptides.20−22 These polypeptides
have biofunctionality, which separates them from other synthetic polymers,
and because of this, they are now being used in tissue engineering,
regenerative medicine, drug delivery, gene delivery, and wound healing.22−24 Different synthetic and natural materials are being used for SAP
synthesis. Today research is more focused on hybrid polymers where
natural and synthetic polymers cross-link to form hydrogels with high
absorption and good mechanical properties. Furthermore, the potential
applications of these hybrid polymers in medical, healthcare, and
pharmaceuticals are also expected to benefit the growth of SAP market.25,26

SAPs are also referred to as stimuli-responsive polymer as
they
respond to change in external stimuli like pH, temperature, moisture,
and magnetic or electric field. These polymers produce changes on
micro- or nanoscale like change in morphology, molecular bonding,
and molecular motion.27,28 Recently, stimuli-responsive
polymers have attracted great interest because of in vivo applications.
These polymeric gels are being used to store, protect, and release
drug at the target site.29 Not only gels
but also peptides, metalloprotein carriers, and cross-linked self-assembled
peptide-based materials are being used as drug carriers.30−32

Wound healing is a complex process that involves sequential
deposition
of extracellular matrix deposition like collagen and fibronectin.
This deposition of matrix molecules helps in the formation of new
tissue. GHK is a tripeptide complex that has been used in the cosmetic
industry since 1973. GHK complex exhibits high affinity for copper(II)
ions forming GHK-Cu.33 This metal–peptide
complex promotes tissue regeneration and acts as copper delivery agent
required for cellular functions. Use of GHK-Cu instead of GHK has
more potent application as this copper peptide complex elevates copper
deficiency with no oxidative damage.34 This
copper tripeptide complex in wound healing plays an important role
as it stimulates the production of collagen and helps in resuming
the blood flow into damaged tissue. It also aids in improving the
expression of basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial
growth, which forms blood vessel.35

In our previous work, we discussed the synthesis of the superabsorbent
polymer using polyaspartic acid as natural polymer and acrylic acid
(AA) as synthetic monomer, which were cross-linked with ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA)
to form superabsorbent polymer. The swelling characterization of the
polymer was done by exposing them to different physiological fluids
like water, saline, glucose solution, and in solutions of different
pH values. The synthesized polymers were evaluated by physiochemical
techniques like Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric
analysis, and scanning electron microscopy.36

However, our present study is an extension to our previous
work,
which explained the in vitro and in vivo study of superabsorbent polymer
synthesized from polyaspartic acid and acrylic acid. Our current study
focuses on encapsulation and release studies of GHK-Cu peptide. GHK-Cu
peptide has been used for wound healing (in vivo studies) and has
produced satisfactory results.37 In our
research work, we focus on using GHK-Cu as drug moiety and will evaluate
the peptide release on burn wounds. The polymer with and without peptide
was then further evaluated for in vivo studies. The in vivo study
includes wound closure, biochemical assay, histopathological examination,
and toxicity studies.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 In Vitro Blood Compatibility of the Polymer
2.1.1 Blood Clotting Test and Bovine Serum Albumin
(BSA) Adsorption/Protein Adsorption
The blood compatibility
of the polymeric material has been evaluated by studying the blood
clotting and protein adsorption test. The blood clotting analysis
explains the antithrombic property of the polymer, whereas the bovine
serum adsorption helps in explaining thrombosis. Both these studies
help in choosing the polymer to be used further for in vitro and in
vivo studies.

The bar graph in Figure 1 clearly shows the blood clotting index and
protein adsorption values of the superabsorbent polymers synthesized
by using two different cross-linkers EGDMA and TMPTA.

Figure 1 (a) Blood clotting index
and (b) protein adsorption of polymer
samples.

The superabsorbent polymers were
synthesized with polyaspartic
acid and neutralized acrylic acid using different cross-linkers and
initiator. The cross-linkers used for this study were ethylene glycol
dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA),
a difunctional and trifunctional, respectively. The main objective
of synthesizing superabsorbent polymer was to use a polymer with moisture-retaining
capacity. As moisture accelerates wound healing, the polymers used
for wound healing should be designed in such a manner that it has
good absorption and high biocompatibility. The biocompatibility is
explained by BCI and protein absorption value in terms of thrombogenicity.
Biocompatibility studies were performed to evaluate the biocompatibility
properties of polyaspartic acid- and acrylic acid-based polymer with
EGDMA and TMPTA cross-linkers. The synthesized polymer should have
a high BCI (%) value and a low BSA absorption, which means the material
has high thrombotic effect. Considering Table 1 and Figure 1a, the EGDMA-based polymer shows higher BCI and lower
protein absorption values than TMPTA (Figure 1b). Among all six samples, EGDMA (1:1) polymer
gave the best blood compatibility. Therefore, it was concluded that
EGDMA-based SAP possesses better biocompatibility than TMPTA-based
SAP, which can be further evaluated for in vitro and in vivo studies.
Blood biocompatibility studies have shown that EGDMA samples are more
biocompatible.

2.1.2 Peptide Release Study
The in vitro
analysis was carried out to study the efficiency of the polymer material
with peptide. The peptide GHK-Cu was incorporated in the polymer with
optimized swelling and biocompatibility. The PASP:AA ratio with best
efficiency was observed to be 1:1 in the case of EGDMA as cross-linker
and 1:5 in the case of TMPTA as cross-linker. The polymers have been
further used for analyzing the release and encapsulation efficiencies
of peptide, i.e., GHK-Cu.

Figure 2 explains the GHK-Cu release from polyaspartic acid
and acrylic acid polymer with two different cross-linkers (Figure 2a,b). The peptide
loading was further confirmed by FTIR and energy-dispersive spectrometry
(EDX) analyses to confirm the presence of GHK-Cu Figure 3 (SI3). Among all four models, the peptide release from EGDMA- and TMPTA-based
sample follows first-order model (Table 2). The peptide encapsulation was confirmed
by FTIR and EDX analyses to confirm the presence of GHK-Cu Figure 4.

The in vitro studies were performed to evaluate the
polymer material
for drug/peptide-delivery application. The peptide GHK-Cu was used
as a drug moiety for the study. The encapsulation efficiency of the
polymer/monomer ratio 1:1 with EGDMA as cross-linker has been found
to be 78.36%. Drug releases at time intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4, 20, and
24 h are 15.75 ± 2.01, 38.12 ± 3.38, 45.17 ± 4.72,
59.22 ± 2.78, 84.91 ± 4.06, and 92.61 ± 3.10%, respectively.
This release of peptide from polymer was further studied using four
mathematical models to investigate the mechanism and model of release.
The release kinetics from EGDMA-based polymer followed first-order
kinetics. The encapsulation efficiency of the polymer with TMPTA was
66.01%. Figure 2b depicts
the drug releases (%) at predetermined time intervals of 1, 2, 3,
4, 20 and 24 h to be 30.20 ± 4.14, 42.77 ± 4.89, 48.26 ±
3.25, 55.58 ± 2.75, 69.25 ± 4.89, and 75.32 ± 3.67%,
respectively. Furthermore, the release mechanism was evaluated using
four models, viz., zero-order, first-order, Korsmeyer Peppas, and
Higuchi. This release kinetics of peptide release from TMPTA-based
polymer followed the Korsmeyer Peppas model. The peptide encapsulation
was confirmed by FTIR and EDX analyses to confirm the presence of
GHK-Cu (Figures 3 and 4). The EGDMA-based polymer with 1:1 ratio (PASP:AA)
was further evaluated on animal models (in vivo studies) as this polymer
showed good peptide release efficiency.

2.2 In Vivo
Analysis
The in vitro analysis
was performed on two samples, one with EGDMA as cross-linker with
polymer/monomer ratio 1:1 and other with TMPTA as cross-linker with
polymer/monomer ratio 1:5 represented as PASP:AA (E) (1:1) and PASP:AA
(T) 1:5, respectively. The superabsorbent polymer with EGDMA as cross-linker,
which showed better blood compatibility and peptide release results,
was further evaluated for in vivo studies. The polymer encapsulated
with peptide was used for evaluating the healing potential on the
wound bed. The in vivo studies include wound closure, biochemical
assay, histopathological examination, and toxicity studies.

The animals were arranged as:

Group I = control.

Group
II (model) = burned wound (untreated).

Group III (A) = polymer
(polyaspartic acid (PASP) and acrylic acid).

Group IV (A″)
= polymer-encapsulated peptide (GHK-Cu).

2.2.1 Wound
Closure Study
Wound contraction
of a wound shows the effect on wound healing. Wound healing is a complex
process that is hindered by different factors. Histopathology images
helped us to predict the wound healing process on 8th day and 15th
day, as shown in Figure 8. The wound contraction area on application of peptide-encapsulated
polymer, polymer, and control was measured on 0th, 8th, and 15th days.
On 0th day, wound was created using a thermocouple with 26 mm diameter.
On 0th day, wound was created using thermocouple with 26 mm diameter.
The wound contraction using peptide-encapsulated polymer showed fastest
wound closure compared to polymer and control. On 8th day contraction
was observed from 26 to 10 mm with polymer-encapsulated peptide (A″),
while for polymer sample (A), the wound area was found to be 15 mm.
A wound healing of 61.53% was observed with GHK-Cu-encapsulated polymer
and 42.30% with polymer alone. On 15th day, the wound contraction
recorded was 4 mm for peptide -encapsulated polymer (A″) and
10 mm for polymer (A). Thus, 84.61 and 61.58% of healing were observed
with peptide-encapsulated polymer (A″) and with only polymer,
respectively. The release of GHK-Cu on the wound showed remarkable
improvement in wound with hair growth observed on wound bed on 15th
day. For model (Group II), the wound areas were measured to be 26,
23, and 25 mm (infection) on 0th, 8th, and 15th days, respectively.
The wound closure analysis explains that wound treated by the peptide-incorporated
polymer (A″) shows fast recovery of epidermal layer on 15th
day. The wound contractions (%) from peptide-encapsulated polymer
(A″) on 8th day and 15th day were found to be 61.53 and 84.61%,
respectively. However, the wound contractions (%) of polyaspartic
acid and acrylic acid polymer (A) on 8th and 15th days were found
to be 42.30 and 61.53%, respectively. The control (group I) shows
unaltered inflammatory cells, epithelial layer, and appendages on
healthy skin. The model rat (group II) showed inflammatory cells,
ruptured tissues, and proliferation of epidermis with hyperkeratosis
on 8th day, whereas on 15th day, it showed decrease in inflammation
but no epithelial layer growth. The polyaspartic acid and acrylic
acid polymer (group III) were able to accelerate epithelial layer
growth on the 15th day and partial epithelialization on 8th day. The
peptide-incorporated polymer (group IV) (A″) showed increase
in epithelial layer from 8th day to 15th day. Increased angiogenesis,
few blood vessels, fibroblast proliferation, and appendages present
at 15th day confirm rapid healing of the wound. Histopathological
examination also confirmed the fastest healing found in peptide-encapsulated
polymer. The toxicity tests showed that polymer with and without peptide
did not cause any toxicity to the animal model used (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Wound closure on 0th,
8th, and 15th days using polymer with and
without encapsulated GHK-Cu (n = 6) (p < 0.05).

2.2.2 Biochemical
Assay
This study indicates
the biochemical changes on the 8th and 15th days. Granulation tissues
were collected on the 8th and 15th days for biochemical and antioxidant
evaluation. Quantitative estimation of the biochemical parameters
of wound tissue is presented in Table 3, whereas graphical representation is shown in Figure 6. The wound contraction
is further supported by biochemical assay, histopathology, and toxicity
studies. Significant (p < 0.05) increases of DNA,
protein, hexosamine, and hydroxyproline contents observed for peptide-encapsulated
polymer (A″) after 8th day were 47, 34, 28, and 29%, respectively,
and after 15 days, they were 64, 43, 50, and 38%, in comparison to
model (group II). Hydroxyproline is a marker of collagen biosynthesis,
whereas hexosamine reflects the effect on granulation tissue as well
as stabilization of the collagen molecules by electrostatic and ionic
interactions. The estimation of DNA and protein content in wounds
indicates the mitotic potential of the wound tissue.

2.2.2.1 Antioxidant Evaluation
The activities
of the antioxidant enzymes—catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase
(SOD), gluthatione, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) groups, were
studied as an important indication of treatment process, and the values
are reported in Table 4. Enzymatic activities were calculated using skin of all of the six
rats in each group taken as an average and including standard deviation.
On introduction of PASP, AA polymer, and polymer with GHK-Cu, these
levels further changed, indicating tissue repair and normalization
of enzymes and proteins concentration. Significant increase in CAT,
SOD, and glutathione and decrease in ROS concentration were observed
prominently for groups IV (A″) compared to group II (model).
This shows enhanced mitigation of the wound with the polymer with
GHK-Cu. A 25–50% improvement in concentration levels was observed
with polymer with GHK-Cu on 15th day (Table 4). Significant increase in the catalase,
superoxide dismutase, and glutathione and decrease in ROS concentration
were observed prominently for peptide-encapsulated polymer samples.
Wound condition, of group II animals (untreated wound), showed reduced
levels of CAT, SOD, and gluthatione and increased levels of ROS in
the case of control samples.

The maximum healing effect was seen for polymer with GHK-Cu, which
attained the desired values in comparison to model. The wound healing
was observed to follow the following trend as: model < PASP:AA
< polymer with GHK-Cu (Figure 7).

2.2.3 Histopathological Examination
Wound
contraction in a wound shows the effect on wound healing. Wound healing
is a complex process that is hindered by different factors. Histopathology
images helped us in predicting the wound healing process. The wound
contraction areas on application of peptide-encapsulated polymer,
polymer, and control were measured on 0th, 8th, and 15th days as shown
in Figure 8. On 0th day, wound was created using thermocouple
with 26 mm diameter. The control (group I) shows unaltered inflammatory
cells, epithelial layer, and appendages on healthy skin. For model
(Group II), the wound areas were 26, 23, and 25 mm (infection) on
0th, 8th, and 15th days, respectively. The model rat (group II) showed
inflammatory cells, ruptured tissues, and proliferation of epidermis
with hyperkeratosis on 8th day, whereas on 15th day, there was decrease
in inflammation but no epithelial layer growth. On 8th day, contraction
was observed from 26 to 10 mm with polymer-encapsulated peptide (A″),
while for polymer sample (A), the wound area was found to be 15 mm.
A wound healing of 61.53% was observed with GHK-Cu-encapsulated polymer
and 42.30% with polymer alone. On 15th day, the wound contraction
recorded was 4 mm for peptide-encapsulated polymer (A″) and
10 mm for polymer (A). Thus, 84.61 and 61.58% of healing were observed
with peptide-encapsulated polymer (A″) and with only polymer,
respectively. The polyaspartic acid and acrylic acid polymer (group
III) was able to accelerate epithelial layer growth on 15th day and
partial epithelialization on 8th day. The peptide-incorporated polymer
(group IV) (A″) showed increase in epithelial layer from 8th
day to 15th day. Increased angiogenesis, few blood vessels, fibroblast
proliferation, and appendages present at 15th day confirm rapid healing
of the wound. The release of GHK-Cu on the wound showed remarkable
improvement in wound with hair growth observed on wound bed on 15th
day. Histopathological examination also confirmed the fastest healing
found in peptide-encapsulated polymer. The wound contraction using
peptide-encapsulated polymer showed fastest wound closure than polymer
and control. The wound closure analysis explains that wound treated
by the peptide-incorporated polymer (A″) shows fast recovery
of epidermal layer on 15th day.

2.2.4 Toxicity Tests
The toxicity tests
were performed to analyze the toxicity effect of the polymeric material
and peptide-encapsulated polymer material on the liver and kidney.
The tests were performed on serum separated from blood. The procedure
for these tests is explained in detail in the Supporting Information
(SI2). There is a standard reference range
for all mentioned toxicity tests in Table 5. From Table 5, it is clear that all toxicity tests performed were
in series. The control and model animals did not show any toxicity
due to application of the polymeric material (Figure 9).

3 Conclusions
To conclude, we have synthesized biocompatible polyaspartic acid-based
superabsorbent polymer. This synthesized superabsorbent was loaded
with a peptide possessing healing properties. Peptide-encapsulated
polymer (A″) is more efficient for wound healing compared to
polymers alone (A). GHK-Cu has been found to produce effective wound
healing. The remarkable healing using peptide-encapsulated polymer
was confirmed by wound closure, biochemical assay, histopathological
examination, and toxicity studies.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation of Polyaspartic Acid- and Acrylic
Acid-Based Polymer
The synthesis of polyaspartic acid- and
acrylic acid-based superabsorbent polymer has been discussed in detail
in our previous work.36 Different polymers
were synthesized by varying the ratio of polyaspartic acid (PASP),
acrylic acid (AA) with initiator, and cross-linker (EGDMA and TMPTA)
at constant temperature range 80–85 °C. The polymer with
the highest swelling in water was further studied as explained in
our last research. The synthesized polymer was placed in dialysis
bag (mesh size) 10 kDa in water for 7 days to remove the unreacted
monomer.

4.2 In Vitro Studies
4.2.1 In
Vitro Blood Compatibility of the Synthesized
Polymers
4.2.1.1 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Adsorption/Protein
Adsorption
The amount of protein adsorbed (mg/g) was calculated
using the following equation38,39 (SI1) 1  where

C0 = BSA concentration before adsorption (mg/mL).

Ca = BSA concentration after adsorption
(mg/mL).

W = weight of the swollen hydrogel
(g).

V = volume of BSA solution used (mL).

All measurements were done in triplicate and the averages of these
values together with their standard deviation have been reported.

4.2.1.2 Blood Clotting Test
The blood
clotting index (BCI) has been calculated by using the following equation38,39 (SI2): 2  where

ODt = optical density
of the test sample.

ODc = optical density of the
control sample.

All measurements were done in triplicate and
have been reported
taking the average and calculating the standard deviation.

4.2.2 Peptide Encapsulation
The encapsulation
efficiency was measured by comparing the UV absorption spectra of
peptide-loaded polymeric sample using calibration curve of peptide40,41 (SI3).

The encapsulation efficiency
was calculated using the following equation 3  

4.2.3 Peptide Release Studies
The amount
of peptide release was measured at 605 nm using UV spectrophotometer
at predetermined time intervals, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h. Aliquot
(3 mL) was used for absorbance measurement. Volume of the solution
was maintained by returning back aliquots after measurement40,41 (SI4).

4.3 In Vivo
Studies
4.3.1 Animal Grouping and Dosing
A total
of 24 wistar rats of weight 220 ± 20 g were used. The animal
experiments were performed according to ethical approval (949/IAEC/16)
and guidelines of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi,
India. The animals were separately kept in clean cages and were divided
into three groups(i) Group I = control.

(ii) Group II (model) = burned wound (untreated).

(iii) Group III (A) = polymer (polyaspartic
acid (PASP) and acrylic acid).

(iv) Group IV (A″) = polymer-encapsulated
peptide (GHK-Cu).



The in vivo experiments
were performed in triplicate
with six animals in each group II, III, and IV and three animals in
control group.

4.3.2 Excision Burn Wound Model
Wistar
rats (220 ± 20 g) were anesthetized, and dorsal hairs were shaved
and sanitized using ethanol. A cylindrical stainless rod of 35 mm
diameter with insulated rubber handle was used for burns. The temperature
was maintained by the instrument according to the feed. The temperature
for second-degree burn was 100 °C. The duration of burn on wistar
rat was 30 s. After creating the burn wound, the polymeric materials
were applied on the wound bed.42

4.3.3 Measurement of Wound Area
Wound
contraction was measured on 8th and 15th days using a vernier caliper.
The comparative healing rate was evaluated by comparing mean wound
contraction in comparison to control.43 The percentage wound contraction was calculated using the following
equation 4  where

W0 = wound area on
zero day.

Wn = wound area on nth day (n = 8, 15).

4.3.4 Biochemical Analysis
The tissues
were collected on 8th and 15th days for biochemical assay. The granulation
tissues were assessed for DNA, protein, hydroxyproline, and hexosamine.44 The antioxidant levels in tissue were evaluated
by studying the levels of glutathione, catalase, superoxide dismutase,
and reactive oxygen species. All methods are described in the Supporting
Information (SI5).

4.3.5 Histopathological Evaluation
For
histopathological evaluation, the animals were sacrificed on 8th and
15th days as wound tissues were fixed with 10% formalin solution.
Tissue blocks in paraffin were prepared and sectioned using Microtome
(RM 2235, Germany). The sectioned tissues were collected on glass
slides, stained using hematoxylin and eosins, and evaluated using
a microscope. Hematoxylin and Eosin stains were used to visualize
and differentiate between control, model, polymer, and peptide-incorporated
polymer tissues. All morphometric parameters were recorded using an
image analyzer (Olympus microscope BX61, Japan). The epidermal and
dermal regions were evaluated. Digital photomicrographs were captured
and wounds were evaluated for new blood capillaries formation and
regeneration.45

4.3.6 Toxicity
Tests
The toxicity tests
were performed to investigate the effect of polymer and peptide-incorporated
polymer on liver and kidney. Blood samples were collected from cardiac
puncture of rats. The serum separated from blood was used for performing
liver and kidney tests. These liver tests include SGOT, SGPT, ALP,
and Billirubin, whereas blood urea nitrogen and creatinine tests are
to evaluate the toxicity content present in rat.46−48 The detailed
explanation of toxicity tests is presented in the Supporting Information
(SI6).

4.3.7 Statistical
Analysis
All of the
values are presented as mean ± standard deviation using GraphPad
Prism software. Statistical analysis were performed using t-test. P values < 0.005 were considered
significant.
