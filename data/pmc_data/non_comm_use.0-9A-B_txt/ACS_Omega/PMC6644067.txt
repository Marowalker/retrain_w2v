In
this paper, we present a new synthetic route to produce optically
active nanofibers of poly[2-(sec-butyl) aniline]
(PSBA). Optically active PSBA nanofibers were produced by in situ
chemical oxidative polymerization of a racemic monomer, (±)-2-sec-buthylaniline, in the presence of 1.5 M (+)- or (−)-camphor
sulfonic acid (HCSA) with a monomer concentration of 0.025 M at 0
°C. The mirror-imaged circular dichroism spectra of both PSBA/(+)HCSA
and PSBA/(−)HCSA show that the two polymers are optically active
enantiomers, and in this condition, the chemical oxidation of 2SBA
is enantioselective polymerization. The produced polymer has a uniform
nanofibrillar morphology with an average diameter of 55 nm according
to scanning electron microscopy and a number average molecular weight
of 4680 g/mol as determined by gel permeation chromatography.

Introduction
Chirality in polymers arises from helical
conformations of polymer
chains. A helical chain has two forms: one right-handed and the other
left-handed, which together are known as enantiomers. If one of two
helix forms is more prevalent, then the polymer becomes optically
active.1

Conductive polymers have
attracted a great deal of attention from
many researchers because of their wide range of applications.2,3 Among conductive polymers, polyaniline (PANI) is attractive because
of its low cost, easy production, high environmental stability, and
potential for use in many applications such as sensors, printable
electronics, actuators, supercapacitors, electromagnetic shielding,
corrosion protection, biocomposites, filtration membranes, and electro-optical
applications among many others.4−12

In recent decades, chiral PANI has been extensively investigated
and suggested for use in applications such as chiral recognition and
enantiomeric separations.13,14 Chirality in conductive
polymers can be obtained either by polymerizing a chiral monomer or
by doping an achiral polymer with a chiral acid.15,16 The first report for optically active PANI was presented by Wallace
and co-workers wherein the optically active polymer was prepared through
the enantioselective electropolymerization of aniline in the presence
of either (+)- or (−)-camphor sulfonic acid (HCSA).16 This same group then demonstrated that doping
the emeraldine base form of PANI with a chiral acid in an organic
solvent can also produce an optically active polymer.17−20 Next, they prepared optically active PANI by in situ chemical oxidative
polymerization of aniline and its derivatives in the presence of chiral
acids in aqueous solution.21−24 Kuramoto and co-workers synthesized optically active
PANI and its derivatives in organic solvents via oxidative polymerization
using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzenquinone in the presence of either
(+)- or (−)-HCSA.25−27 Goto prepared a new optically
active PANI derivative via polymerization of an optically active monomer.15 The effect of copolymerization of aniline with
substituted aniline on the conformation and optical activity of the
generated nanofibers was further investigated.28−30 The presence
of substituted aniline in the polymer backbone causes a change in
optical activity and in some cases a reversal of the helical form
of the nanofibers. Therefore, the helical form and chiroptical properties
of this polymer can be controlled to some extent.28−30

Because
solubility of PANI in most organic solvents is low, its
applications are limited.31 Therefore,
PANI derivatives (ortho, meta, and N-substituted) have often been
studied for practical purposes because of their higher solubility
compared to the parent polymer.22,31 One of these PANI derivatives
is poly[2-(sec-butyl) aniline] (PSBA) which has good
solubility in organic solvents and was first synthesized and characterized
in our laboratory.32−34 PSBA intrinsically is a chiral polymer because its
monomer is chiral [(±)-2-sec-buthylaniline].
Therefore, there are two ways to prepare optically active PSBA: (1)
polymerization of the racemic monomer in the presence of a chiral
dopant (as reported here), and (2) the resolution of the monomer into
two enantiomers followed by polymerization of each enantiomer separately
(currently under study).

For the generation of an optically
active polymer, a single-handed
helical conformation is needed.1,19 In conjugated polymers
placing a chiral anion dopant closer to the polymer backbone can facilitate
the formation of a single screw helical conformation.17,35

For substituted PANI, a chiral dopant cannot approach the
polymer
chain as easily as it can the parent PANI, so that the formation of
a one-screw helical conformation becomes more difficult when increasing
the bulkiness of substituents from a hydrogen atom to a bulky substituent
such as 2-sec-butyl.17,18

As shown
in Scheme 1, as the
bulkiness of the substituent (R) becomes larger, the ring-torsion
angle of adjacent phenyl rings increases because of increased steric
hindrance. This has a determinative effect on the preparation of a
one-screw helical chain and also causes reduction in the basic strength
of the polymer.22,31

Scheme 1 Ring-Torsion Angle
in PANI Derivatives because of Steric Hindrance
of the R Substituent
Kaner and Epstein with their co-workers separately have
demonstrated
the general template-free synthetic methods for making nanofibers
of PANI and its derivatives by either interfacial polymerization or
by rapidly mixing aniline, acid, and oxidant as well as a dilute polymerization
method.36−45 They reported the formation of substituted PANI nanofibers such
as polychloroaniline, polymethylaniline, and polyethylaniline.44,45 Until now, no published studies have reported on the formation of
nanofibers from substituted PANI with bulky substituents such as propyl
or butyl. In addition, attempts to prepare PSBA nanofibers via either
interfacial polymerization or rapid mixing of aniline, acid and oxidant,
have not been successful. In this study, we report the first successful
synthesis of a nanofibrillar structure of PSBA as a bulky substituted
PANI, by using a new method under special conditions. Because 2-sec-butyl is a bulky substituent, it causes the reactivity
of the monomer to decrease which in turn complicates the creation
of the nanofibrillar structure. Scheme 2 indicates the polymerization of 2SBA in the presence
of HCSA and the different structures of PSBA.

Scheme 2 Polymerization of
2-sec-Butyl Aniline in the Presence
of Camphor Sulfonic Acid and the Formation of the Polaron, the Bipolaron,
and the Base Form of PSBA
Results and Discussion
The generation of nanofibers
through oxidation in aqueous acidic
solution is an intrinsic property of PANI.46,47 However, despite the parent PANI readily forming nanofibers, this
is not the case with PANI derivatives under the same polymerization
conditions and in most cases result in spherical structures.44 This has been attributed to the lower rate of
the polymerization reaction in substituted aniline relative to the
parent aniline because of steric hindrance and electronic effects
of substituents on the ring or on the nitrogen atom. It has been suggested
that the low rate of the polymerization reaction leads to heterogeneous
nucleation, causing the nuclei to grow in all directions and form
agglomerated structures.44,48,49 Therefore, in order to synthesize nanofibers of PANI derivatives,
homogeneous nucleation must be induced. For this purpose, the introduction
of initiators such as N-phenyl-1,4-phenylendiamine
(NPPD) (aniline dimer) or 1,4-benzendiamine is needed. Initiators
increase the rate of the reaction leading to homogeneous nucleation
that can produce nanofibrillar structures.41−49

In the present study, 2.5 mol % of NPPD was added as an initiator
and the polymerization reaction of 2-sec-butyl aniline
(2-SBA) was carried out by two different procedures in aqueous solutions
of either (+)- or (−)-HCSA at a constant temperature of 0 °C
via chemical oxidation with ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) under various
conditions such as different molar ratios of oxidant to monomer and
different acid concentrations. In all polymerization reactions, the
monomer concentration was 0.025 M.

In Method 1, according to
previous reports,36−38 scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images indicated that when the reaction vessel was
agitated for 15 s, nanofibers did not form, instead various structures
including microspheres and/or amorphous structures were created because
of agglomeration of the PSBA nuclei (Figure 1, polymers a, b, and c).

Figure 1 SEM images of polymers
formed using Method 1 which was agitated
for 15 s at 0 °C under conditions of (a) [HCSA]/[2SBA] = 40 and
[APS]/[2SBA] = 1, (b) [HCSA]/[2SBA] = 40 and [APS]/[2SBA] = 0.25 and
(c) [HCSA]/[2SBA] = 2 and [APS]/[2SBA] = 0.25.

In contrast, employing Method 2 resulted in nanofibers with
an
average diameter of 55 nm (Figure 2, polymers C and D). In order to study the effects
of the HCSA to monomer molar ratio on morphology and optical activity
of the polymer, the polymerization reaction of 2-SBA was carried out
by Method 2 under different acid concentrations including 0.025, 0.05,
1, 1.5, 2, and 3 M. In other words, an [HCSA]/[2-SBA] ratio of 1,
2, 40, 60, 80, and 120. With HCSA concentrations of 2 and 3 M, no
precipitated polymer was observed; after 24 h the solution simply
turned dark violet because of the presence of short oligomers. This
can be related to the high viscosity of the solution with an acid
concentration of 2 M or higher. Under these conditions, the lower
diffusion of reagents and monomer prohibits the growth of polymer
chains.29

Figure 2 SEM images of polymers formed in Method
2 at a temperature of 0
°C and [APS]/[2SBA] = 0.25 with different ratios of [HCSA]/[2SBA],
(A) =1, (B) =2, (C) =40, and (D) =60.

Figure 2 shows
SEM
images, in the cases of A to D, the polymers were obtained in different
molar ratios of [HCSA]/[2SBA] as 1, 2, 40, and 60, respectively. At
a low ratio of HCSA to monomer (lower than 5), HCSA acts as an emulsifier,
which causes the formation of micelles that fill with monomer. The
micelles act as soft-templates, so oxidation leads to the formation
of microtubes and/or microspheres29 (Figure 2, A and B polymers).
However, in higher ratios of [HCSA]/[2SBA], such as 40 or 60, HCSA
plays the role of a protective agent and prevents heterogeneous nucleation
which leads to the formation of nanofibrillar structures (Figure 2, C and D polymers).29

Figure 3 shows images
of reaction vessels at the end of polymerization. As can be seen at
a 2 M concentration of HCSA no precipitated polymer was observed;
however, at 1 and 2 M acid concentrations, nanofibers were produced
which dispersed in solution, whereas at 0.025 and 0.05 M acid concentrations,
the produced polymer precipitated to the bottom of the vessel.

The circular dichroism (CD)
spectra of these polymers dispersed
in deionized water are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen, only one polymer is optically active—the
one prepared in 1.5 M HCSA solution (entry 7 in Table 1). Although in the 1 M HCSA solution the
nanofibrillar structure was obtained, these nanofibers do not exhibit
optical activity (Figure 4, entry 6 in Table 1).

Figure 4 CD spectra of PSBA/(−)HCSA dispersed in water generated
by Method 2 with [APS]/[2SBA] = 0.25 in different dopant acid concentrations.

In all CD spectra, the absolute
magnitude of the CD bands could
be estimated approximately from the mass of the polymer dispersed
in water or dissolved in the organic solvent.

Figure 5 shows the
CD spectra of the nanofibers (entry 7 in Table 1) dispersed in deionized water that were
generated by Method 2 in 1.5 M aqueous solutions of both (+)- and
(−)-HCSA. The mirror-imaged CD spectra for both PSBA/(+)-HCSA
and PSBA/(−)-HCSA indicate that the two polymers are optically
active enantiomers. Each CD spectrum possesses five absorption bands
at 200, 291, 335, 380, and 440 nm. The Cotton effect at 200 and 291
nm is related to the presence of the CSA anion in the polymer, whereas
the bands at 335, 380, and 440 nm are associated with the optical
activity in the polymer backbone. In addition, the peaks at 335 and
380 nm can be attributed to the bisignate exciton-coupled bands which
are related to the benzenoid π–π* absorption band
that one pair of this band partly overlaps with the CD band of the
CSA anion. Moreover, the peak at 440 nm that partly overlaps corresponds
to the low wavelength polaron absorption band.26,29,50 This indicates that the chemical oxidation
of 2-SBA is an enantioselective polymerization in the presence of
either (+)- or (−)-HCSA with an acid concentration of 1.5 M
and a molar ratio of [HCSA]/[monomer] of about 60.16,29,30 At lower acid concentrations, there does
not appear to be sufficient acid dopants to produce a chiral polymer
as has been observed in previous studies.29,30

Figure 5 CD
spectra of both PSBA/(+)HCSA and PSBA/(−)HCSA dispersed
in deionized water generated in a 1.5 M HCSA aqueous solution with
a 0.25 molar ratio of oxidant to monomer produced using Method 2 (entry
7 in Table 1).

The polymer chains formed under
these conditions have a helical
conformation. As mentioned above, the helical chain conformation has
two forms: a right-handed form and a left-handed form, for which one
of the two forms has been produced in a greater concentration than
the other leading to the observed optically activity. When 2-(sec-butyl)aniline is dissolved in an HCSA aqueous solution
under the proper conditions given above, the salt of anilinium camphor
sulfonate is produced, in which the aniline molecules are surrounded
by acid molecules. When the aniline is polymerized to produce the
polymer chains, enantiopure HCSA causes the polymer chains to rotate
primarily in one direction, forming a helical structure that leads
to a chiral, optically active polymer.18,19 This helical
structure is preserved by electrostatic bonds of the sulfonate oxygen
to polymer –HN•+– centers and hydrogen bonding of the CSA carbonyl
groups to the –NH– sites of the polymer
backbone (Scheme 2).18,19

In order to obtain a pure optically active polymer, the optically
active salt form was dedoped with NH4OH 1 M aqueous solution
both for PSBA/(−)HCSA and PSBA/(+) HCSA. Figure 6 presents the CD spectra of the nanofibers
dispersed in deionized water after dedoping. The mirror-imaged CD
spectra for the two polymers [PSBA/(−)HCSA and PSBA/(+) HCSA]
after dedoping, indicate that the two polymers are optically active
enantiomers. For comparison, CD spectra of the base form together
with the salt form are shown in Figure 7.

deionized
water in the base form after dedoping with 1 M aqueous NH4OH of both (a) PSBA/(+)HCSA and (b) PSBA/(−)HCSA.

Figure 7 CD spectra of the optically active polymer in both the
base form
and the salt form [PSBA/(−)HCSA].

In addition, we obtained the optically active polymer in
the salt
form with an achiral acid after dedoping the optically active PSBA/HCSA
with a NH4OH solution and redoping with a 1 M HCl aqueous
solution. The CD spectrum of this polymer is shown in Figure 8, indicating that the polymer
is optically active with an achiral anion (Cl–).

Figure 8 CD spectra
of the optically active polymer dispersed in deionized
water after dedoping by NH4OH 1 M aqueous solution (base
form) and after redoping by HCl 1 M aqueous solution (PSBA/HCl).

To study the chiroptical properties
of the optically active nanofibers
in organic solvents, the nanofibers were dissolved in aprotic polar
solvents including N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP),
dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The results
demonstrate that the optical activity of the nanofibers is completely
lost after dissolving in these solvents. This is evident in the CD
spectra taken in organic solvents where there is no longer any Cotton
effect in the region corresponding to the polymer backbone except
for the CD band observed at 291 nm which is associated with the CSA
anion (Figure 9). In
the case of NMP and DMF, because of the basic strength of these solvents,
when PSBA in its emeraldine salt form is dissolved in these solvents,
it becomes deprotonated and immediately produces the emeraldine base
form. As a result, the chiral dopant leaves the polymer chains that
in turn cause a racemization in the polymer backbone because the emeraldine
base rapidly rearranges to an achiral conformation. Bulky substituents
will cause a reduction in polymer basicity strength that arises from
torsional strain in the polymer backbone.31,45,49 This phenomenon is demonstrated by UV/vis
spectra and the change in polymer color from green to blue (Figure 10). Moreover, NMP
and DMF are hydrogen bond acceptors via their carbonyl oxygen which
cause the hydrogen bond of the camphor sulfonate anion to the polymer
backbone to be replaced by this new H-bond. The effect of NMP molecules
on the structure of PSBA/HCSA is illustrated in Scheme 3. As can be seen, the basic strength of NMP
causes the salt form of the polymer changing to the base form (Figure 10).

active PSBA/(+)HCSA nanofibers dissolved

Figure 11a,b shows
UV/vis spectra of the polymers in their salt and base forms in both
NMP and DMF. Both spectra of the salt and base forms exhibit two absorption
bands around 310 and 610 nm associated with π–π*
and n−π* absorptions, indicating similar structures in
which the polymer is deprotonated.26−30 Even when adding HCSA to the polymer solution in
NMP, the color of the solution did not change to green; however, in
DMF when adding HCSA the solution turned green, yet this only lasted
for a few minutes after which the color changed back to blue.

Figure 11 UV/vis spectra
of PSBA/HCSA nanofibers in base and salt forms dissolved
in organic solvents: (a) NMP, (b) DMF, (c) DMSO, or (d) dispersed
in water.

However in DMSO, despite the preservation
of the emeraldine salt
form (as confirmed by the green colored solution and the UV/vis spectrum, Figures 10 and 11c, respectively), the optically active PSBA/HCSA
losses its chiral helical conformation as is evident in the CD spectrum
(Figure 9). In fact,
the CSA anion linkage with the –HN•+– site on the polymer maintains the emeraldine
salt form of the polymer but H-bonding of the CSA carbonyl group to
the polymer –NH– center is completely destroyed
and replaced by H-bonding of the DMSO oxygen atom. This is related
to the strong interaction of DMSO toward CSA because of the steric
hindrance of the 2-sec-butyl group and the DMSO molecule
being smaller than the HCSA molecule.

In Figure 11c,
the UV/vis spectra of the PSBA salt and base forms are shown in DMSO.
In contrast to prior solvents, the UV/vis spectrum of the salt form
in DMSO exhibits a polaron band at 785 nm along with two lower wavelength
absorption bands at 310 and 425 nm that can be attributed to the benzenoid
π–π* transition and a second polaron band, respectively.
In addition, the UV/vis spectrum of the base form indicates two absorption
bands at 310 and 610 nm associated with the benzenoid and quinoid
rings (π–π* and n−π* transitions),
respectively.

Figure 12 indicates
UV/vis spectra with CD spectra together in the base and the salt forms
of the optically active polymer.

Figure 12 UV/vis and CD spectra of the optically
active polymer both in the
salt and the base forms.

Previous reports indicated optically active substituted PANI
such
as poly(o-methoxyaniline), poly(o-ethylaniline), poly(o-toluidine), and poly(o-ethoxyaniline) preserve their optical activity in polar
organic solvents such as DMF, NMP, and DMSO so that the UV/vis spectra
of these polymers exhibit the emeraldine salt form.22,25−27 However, the 2-sec-butyl substituent
in PSBA is too bulky so that it causes a reduction in the basic strength
of the polymer.31 Even with the addition
of HCSA to the solution of the polymer in DMF and NMP, the emeraldine
salt is not formed and the polymer therefore retains its base form.
Consequently, the base form cannot retain a one-handed helical conformation
in the solution and must racemize.

Figure 11d exhibits
the UV/vis spectra of the optically active nanofibers in base and
salt forms dispersed in deionized water. As can be seen, the exciton
band at 638 nm indicates that the polymer is dedoped. In contrast,
the nanofibers in their salt form dispersed in deionized water show
two bands at 324 and 416 nm associated with the benzenoid transition
and the low-wavelength polaron band. A broad absorption band from
higher than 800 nm to the near IR region indicates a delocalized polaron
free-carrier tail absorption because of the formation of the highly
expanded coil chain polymer in a nanofibrillar structure. This causes
the conjugation length to increase leading to higher electrical conductivity
for the polymer in the nanofibrillar form than in a spherical morphology.51,52

Comparing the UV/vis spectra of the nanofibers that have been
dispersed
in deionized water with those dissolved in an organic solvent indicates
a significant difference in the conformations of the polymer chains.
In fact, the polymer chains in the nanofibrillar structure possess
expanded coil conformations, whereas in the solution they exhibit
compact coil conformations.51,52

Despite what
is observed with PSBA/HCl, when the green emeraldine
salt form of PSBA/HCSA is dispersed in deionized water, it maintains
its color and the UV/vis spectrum indicates the doped form of the
polymer. In contrast, when PSBA/HCl in the salt form is dispersed
in deionized water it dedopes immediately. The UV/vis spectrum confirms
this along with the color turning from green to blue. Moreover, the
PSBA/H2SO4 doped form is stable in deionized
water because the CSA– and SO42– anions connect to the polymer chains via two bonds; a hydrogen bond
to –NH– sites and an electrostatic bond
to –HN•+– centers. In contrast, Cl– attaches to the polymer
backbone with only an electrostatic bond and this bond is disturbed
by water (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Connection of CSA–, SO42–, and Cl– to the PSBA Backbone in the Emeraldine
Salt Form of the Polymer
Molecular weight and its distribution of the optically
active nanofibers
were obtained via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The Mn, Mw, and polydispersity
index of this polymer are 4700, 4800, and 1.02, respectively, and
the data are consistent with previous reports for PANI derivatives.15,45

In the current study to investigate the effects of the molar
ratio
of APS (oxidant) to monomer on the degree of oxidation of the polymer
chain, the polymerization reaction was carried out in oxidant molar
ratios of 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.25 using Method 2 at a
constant concentration of monomer and acid (0.025 and 1 M, respectively).
The results indicate that the oxidation degree of the polymer chains
is highly dependent on the molar ratio of the oxidant, which for a
ratio of 0.5 M or higher, the polymer is in its blue (salt) form,
indicating that the polymer is more oxidized than the ideal emeraldine
oxidation state (half-benzenoid/half-quinoid units).

Therefore,
the UV/vis spectra of the dedoped polymers (base form)
in water were studied45 (Figure 13). In Table 2, n → π* absorptions of these
polymers are shown. It is clear that upon increasing the molar ratio
of oxidant above 0.375, the excitonic transition occurs at a lower
wavelength indicating that the oxidation state of the polymer is higher
than the ideal emeraldine oxidation state. This demonstrates that
in this condition, the oxidation state of the polymer is closer to
the pernigraniline or nigraniline oxidation states. Moreover, a qualitative
test for the estimation of the oxidation state of the polymer was
performed. In this test, a small amount of the polymer in its base
form was dissolved in a solution of 0.1 M HCSA and DMSO. If the polymer
is in its ideal emeraldine oxidation state, it will appear deep green
in the solution, whereas if it is in an overoxidized state, it will
appear deep blue in the solution. The results of this test are shown
in Table 2. As can
be observed for oxidant molar ratios of 0.5 and higher, the color
in the solution is blue implying that the polymer is over oxidized
whereas at molar ratios of oxidant less than 0.5, the polymer is in
its ideal emeraldine oxidation state because the color of the solution
turns green.

Figure 14 indicates
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the polymers in base
and salt forms, created under different conditions. As can be seen
in the doped forms, the absorption peak at 1150 cm–1 indicates the presence of the camphor sulfonate anion in the polymer
matrix, whereas this peak is not observed in the base form. In addition,
the peak at 1315 cm–1 indicates that the polymer
chain conformation is cisoid, providing further evidence for a helical
conformation. The absorption intensity of the two peaks at wavelengths
of 1588 and 1495 cm–1 associated with the quantity
of quinoid and benzenoid rings in the polymer chains, respectively,
indicates that the polymers are in their emeraldine or pernigraniline
oxidation states.

are three bands at 2872, 2928, and 2960 cm–1 associated
with stretching vibrations of aliphatic C–H bonds corresponding
to 2-sec-butyl substitution. A peak that appears
about 1450 cm–1 is associated with the methylene
C–H bond. An important peak at about 1138–1142 cm–1 can be attributed to the doped form of the polymer.
The latter peak is accompanied by a peak around 1290 cm–1 that can be assigned to the C–N•+ form, thus confirming the polaron state of the polymer chain
in the doped form. The lack of an absorption peak from about 1620
to 1650 indicates that cyclic phenazine has not been produced because
the presence of the bulky substituent, 2-sec-butyl
likely prevents cyclic phenazine production.33

The electroactivity of the polymer is evident from its cyclic
voltammogram
(Figure 15). The electrochemical
properties of PSBA were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in solution
of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in the presence of a small
amount of acetonitrile. The polymer in its base form was dissolved
in chloroform and cast onto a platinum electrode and tested against
an Ag/Ag+ electrode as working and reference electrodes,
respectively. The two anodic peaks at +0.13 and +0.718 V can be related
to the conversion of the fully reduced form to the emeraldine and
the emeraldine to the fully oxidized form, respectively. The reverse
peak in the reduction scan demonstrates that the polymer has quasi-reversible
redox properties.

Conclusions
Unlike parent PANI,
substituted PANI generates spherical structures
because the substituents increase the polymer chain flexibility. The
generation of nanofibers from PANI derivatives is possible through
homogeneous nucleation via increasing the rate of the polymerization
reaction by use of an initiator with a low redox potential. The production
of nanofibers even for aniline derivatives with bulky substituents
such as 2-sec-butyl aniline is possible via the addition
of a proper ratio of oxidant to monomer without any agitation by a
new method reported here for the first time. In addition, optically
active PSBA is created by tailoring the polymer chain helical conformation
in the presence of a chiral dopant under conditions of zero temperature,
an acid dopant to monomer molar ratio about 60 and 2.5% molar initiator.
Because PSBA is a bulky substituent, its basic strength is lower so
that when dissolved in an aprotic polar organic solvent, the emeraldine
salt form turns into the emeraldine base form and immediately loses
its optical activity. UV/vis spectroscopy displays a free-carrier
tail absorption band from the nanofibrillar structure, when it is
dispersed in deionized water, indicating that the polymer chains have
an expanded coil conformation. In contrast, in solution due to the
high flexibility of the chains, the polymer adopts a compact coil
conformation. In addition, CV analysis indicates that the polymer
is electroactive.

Methods
Materials
All
materials used in this research including
2-SBA, NPPD, HCSA, APS, and other inorganic reagents as well as solvents
were purchased from Merck Company and used as received except for
2-SBA which was distilled under vacuum prior to use.

Methods of
Polymerization
Chemical oxidative polymerization
of 2-SBA was carried out at 0 °C in the presence of either (+)-
or (−)-HCSA as a chiral dopant by two methods (Method 1 and
2). In a typical reaction, 0.5 mmol of the monomer was dissolved in
10 mL of a (+)- or (−)-HCSA 1.5 M aqueous solution, then 2.5
mol % (0.0125 mmol) of NPPD as the initiator was dissolved in a minimum
amount of methanol and added to the monomer solution. In another beaker,
0.5 mmol of APS was dissolved in 10 mL of the same aqueous solution.
The two solutions were put in a refrigerator and cooled to 0 °C.
Next, the two solutions were mixed together using one of the two methods.
In Method 1 (according to previous reports36−38), after rapidly
mixing the two solutions, the vessel was agitated vigorously for 15
s and then kept at a constant temperature of 0 °C without stirring.
However, in Method 2 (that we report here for the first time), the
oxidant solution was injected by a pipette on the sidewall of the
monomer vessel (within a few seconds) so that it did not cause turbulence
in the monomer solution. The vessel without any agitation or stirring
was placed at a constant temperature of 0 °C. After 24 h, the
crude product was separated by filtration and then washed adequately
with deionized water. The crude polymer was dried at room temperature
under vacuum for 24 h.

Dedoping and Redoping
The PSBA/HCSA
powder was deprotonated
to give the base form of the polymer via deprotonation in the NH4OH aqueous solution. For this purpose, 40 mg of polymer salt
was dispersed in 10 mL of 1 M NH4OH and stirred for 1 h
and then filtered and washed with deionized water. Finally, it was
dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature for 24 h.

Redoping
of the basic polymer was carried out in an organic solvent (DMSO)
as well as in an acidic aqueous solution. In this regard, 1.5 mg of
deprotonated polymer was dissolved in 5 mL of 0.1 M HCSA solution
in DMSO and separately 10 mg of de-protonated polymer was dispersed
in 5 mL of 1 M HCSA or 1 M HCl aqueous solution and stirred for 1
h.

Characterization
FT-IR spectra of the doped and dedoped
polymers were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm–1 from KBr pellets using a JASCO spectrophotometer. UV/vis spectra
of the dedoped and the redoped polymer were recorded in organic solvents
(NMP, DMF, and DMSO) or deionized water at room temperature using
an HACH DR 5000 spectrophotometer with concentrations of 0.03–0.08
mg/mL for solutions in organic solvents and 0.5–1 mg/mL for
those dispersed in water using a 1 cm cuvette. CD spectra of both
PSBA/(+)HCSA and PSBA/(−)HCSA, as well as its base form, were
obtained using a JASCO J-715 spectropolarimeter in either an organic
solvent or deionized water. These samples were run at concentrations
of 0.05–0.1 mg/mL for solutions in an organic solvent and 0.5–1
mg/mL for those dispersed in water using a 0.1 cm cuvette. The morphologies
of the polymers synthesized under various conditions were assessed
by the use of a VEGA3 TESCAN scanning electron microscope. The polymer
samples were covered with a thin coat of gold to improve the resolution.
The molecular weight of the polymer was determined by GPC. A solution
with a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL of the polymer in its base form
in tetrahydrofuran was provided, then 20 μL of the solution
was injected into the column at 25 °C. CV analysis was performed
in a range of −1.5 to +2 V with a scan rate of 5–500
mV/s. The electrochemical properties of PSBA were studied by CV in
a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate in the presence
of a small amount of acetonitrile. The polymer in its base form was
dissolved in chloroform and cast onto a platinum electrode and tested
against an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the working and reference
electrodes, respectively.
