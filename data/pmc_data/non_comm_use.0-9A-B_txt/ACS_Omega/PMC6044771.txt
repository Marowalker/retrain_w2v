Breast cancer is the most devastating
disease among females globally.
Conventional chemotherapeutic regimen relies on the use of highly
cytotoxic drugs as monotherapy and combination therapy leading to
severe side effects to the patients as collateral damage. Moreover,
combining hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs create erratic biodistribution
and suboptimal medicinal outcome. Hence, packaging multiple drugs
of diverse mechanisms of action and biodistribution for safe delivery
into tumor tissues with optimal dosages is indispensable for next-generation
breast cancer therapy. To address these, in this report, we describe
a unique cisplatin-triggered self-assembly of linear polymer into
3D-spherical sub 200 nm particles. These nanoparticles comprise a
hydrophobic (paclitaxel) and hydrophilic drug (cisplatin) simultaneously
in a single particle. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed hydrophilic–hydrophilic
interaction and interchain H-bonding as underlying mechanisms of self-assembly.
Confocal microscopy studies evidently demonstrated that these novel
nanoparticles can home into lysosomes in breast cancer cells, fragment
subcellular nuclei, and prevent cell division, leading to improved
breast cancer cell death compared to free drug combination. Moreover,
3D-breast tumor spheroids were reduced remarkably by the treatment
of these nanoparticles within 24 h. These dual-drug-loaded self-assembled
polymeric nanoparticles have prospective to be translated into a clinical
strategy for breast cancer patients.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, breast cancer has emerged as the most frequently
diagnosed cancer and foremost reason of casualties among females,
with ∼1.7 million new cases and 0.6 million deaths per year
globally.1 Traditional treatments involve
surgical removal of tumor (or breast) along with radiation therapy,
hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy.2 In
adjuvant, neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and advanced stages of breast
cancers, several small molecule cytotoxic drugs [paclitaxel (PTX),
cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil, and doxorubicin] are widely used
in clinics.3−8 Unfortunately, because of tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance
mechanisms (intrinsic and extrinsic), most of the cancer cells evade
single drug treatment, leading to resort on combination therapy for
improved efficacy.9−12 Drug combination regimens are exploited extensively in clinics for
the treatment of breast cancer.13−16 However, cytotoxic drug combinations generate severe
augmented dose-limiting toxic side effects to the patients as collateral
damage. Moreover, combination of drugs with entirely different water
solubility (hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs) leads to inconsistent
biodistribution, hence poor accumulation in appropriate dose in the
cancerous tissue preventing desired therapeutic outcome. Nanotechnology-based
tools exhibit the promise to address these issues.

In the last
decade, nanoscale platforms have changed the direction
of cancer chemotherapy.17−20 Myriads of different nanovectors have been developed
to package multiple therapeutic materials (small molecule drugs, antibodies,
siRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins).21−27 Nanoscale platforms can specifically accumulate into tumor tissues
by unique dysfunctional leaky vasculature as well as receptor-mediated
active targeting.28,29 Several nanovectors containing
cytotoxic drugs are already in clinics or in clinical trials for the
treatment of different types of cancers including breast cancer.20,30 Despite having tremendous advancement in nanotechnology-based tool
kits for monodrug or combination drug delivery, amalgamating hydrophobic
and hydrophilic drugs in a single nanoplatform with controlled loading
and release profile remained a major challenge to overcome the erratic
biodistribution and improve therapeutic efficacy.31−34

To address this, herein,
we illustrate a simple and robust synthesis
of CDDP-mediated self-assembled poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMAn) nanoparticles to inhibit cancer cell division
leading to a significant reduction in 3D-breast cancer spheroids.
These polymeric nanoparticles can comprise the hydrophobic, microtubule-stabilizing
drug PTX by ester linkage. However, upon reaction with hydrophilic
CDDP [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anticancer drug],
a remarkable morphological conversion from 2D-structures into 3D-spherical
nanoparticles was observed. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation confirmed
that the hydrophilic–hydrophilic interaction and interpolymer
chain H-bonding triggered CDDP-mediated self-assembly of linear polymers
into spherical nanoscale particles. The hydrophobic–hydrophilic
dual-drug-loaded polymeric NPs were compartmentalized into subcellular
lysosomes followed by nuclear fragmentation and stalled cell division
directing to a significant reduction in breast cancer spheroid formation.
In this study, we have chosen PTX and CDDP because of their (i) highly
hydrophobic and hydrophilic nature, respectively, causing different
biodistribution, (ii) extensive use as monotherapy and combination
therapy in clinics because of FDA approval despite having severe toxic
side effects to the patients, and (iii) different mechanisms of action.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of the Polymer–Drug
Conjugate
and Self-Assembly
Sequential conjugation of hydrophobic–hydrophilic
drugs to polymer and self-assembly are depicted in Scheme 1a,b. First, PMAn35,36 (1) was completely hydrolyzed into poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic acid) (PMAc) (2) followed by conjugation
of hydrophobic drug PTX (PMAc/PTX = 1:5 molar ratio) through ester
linkage with the 2′-OH group of PTX to form the PMA–PTX
conjugate (3) (Scheme 1a). CDDP was further conjugated with PMA–PTX
(PMA–PTX/CDDP = 1:20 molar ratio) to obtain the PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate (4). The hydrolyzed PMAc (2),
PMA–PTX conjugate (3), and PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate (4) were characterized by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (Figures S1–S3). We
further calculated the number of PTX molecules conjugated in each
polymer chain by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The number of CH3 protons in the polymer and PTX and the ortho-protons in aromatic
ester and aromatic amide moieties in PTX were calculated from the 1H NMR spectra in Figure S3. The
ratio of CH3 protons and aromatic protons confirmed that
nearly five PTX molecules were conjugated in each polymer chain. PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate (4) was further confirmed by 195Pt NMR having a characteristic peak at δ = −2572.6 ppm
(Figure S4).

To visualize the shape and morphology, the PMA–PTX
conjugate
(3) was subjected to field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM). From the FESEM image in Figure 1a, it was confirmed that the PMA–PTX
conjugate exhibited a polymeric 2D-sheet-like structure. Interestingly,
a remarkable transformation of morphology was observed in the PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate (4). Electron microscopy [FESEM, atomic force
microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)] images
(Figures 1b,c and S5c) clearly demonstrated that the reaction with
the hydrophilic drug CDDP to PMA–PTX transformed its shape
into spherical nanoparticles of sub 200 nm diameter. We further confirmed
the self-assembled particle nature of the PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate in water by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the Tyndall
effect (Figure S5a,b). The critical aggregation
concentration (CAC) at which the PMA–PTX–CDDP conjugate
self-assembled into nanoparticles was determined by conventional fluorescence
emission spectroscopy of pyrene encapsulation and was calculated to
be 60 μg/mL (Figure 1d). The loading of PTX and CDDP in the nanoparticle was determined
by UV–vis spectroscopy through the absorbance versus concentration
calibration graph at characteristic λmax = 273 and
706 nm, respectively. PTX and CDDP loading was found to be 202.9 ±
8 μM and 1563.0 ± 3 μM, respectively (Figure S5d). Finally, the presence of CDDP in
PMA–PTX–CDDP-NP was further validated by energy-dispersion
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) (Figure S6).

2.2 CDDP-Induced
Self-Assembly
2.2.1 Electron Microscopy (FESEM
and AFM)
To understand the role of CDDP in inducing the self-assembly,
we
reacted PMAc (2) with aquated CDDP in a ratiometric manner
(PMAc/CDDP = 1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 molar ratio) to obtain PMAc–CDDP
conjugates with different CDDP contents (Figure 2a). The morphological transformation of PMAc–CDDP
conjugates were further visualized by FESEM and AFM. FESEM images
in Figure 2b evidently
confirmed that CDDP induced the self-assembly of linear polymer PMAc
into spherical shaped nanoparticles in PMAc/CDDP = 1:10 molar ratio.
The same observation was further validated by AFM images (Figure 2c) which confirmed
that CDDP is the responsible agent for self-assembly of polymeric
PMAc. The presence of CDDP in PMA–CDDP-NPs was further confirmed
by EDXS (Figure S7).

of PMAc with different molar ratios of CDDP.
(b,c) FESEM and AFM images of PMA–CDDP-NPs in different molar
ratios to evaluate CDDP-mediated self-assembly, respectively.

2.2.2 Molecular
Dynamics Simulation
To
evaluate the mechanism of self-assembly, MD simulation was performed
on the PMA–PTX–CDDP polymer chain having the PTX/CDDP
molar ratio of 1:4 using GROMACS-4.6.3 package.37 The initial energy minimized structure and self-assembled
structures after 500 ns of simulation (Figure 3a,b) showed that PTX, CDDP, and polymeric
carboxylic acid (−COOH) groups were distributed throughout
the whole self-assembled structure. To understand the structural arrangements
between hydrophobic PTX, the center of masses (COM) between PTX monomers
were calculated over last 10 ns of simulation trajectory. The small
peak near 1.3 nm (Figure S8) indicated
that PTX units tend to aggregate near each other, although because
of other predominant interactions (H-bonding), hydrophobic aggregation
was not enhanced as expected.

Figure 3 (a) Structure of energy-minimized PMA–PTX–CDDP
polymer
chains dispersed in water. (b) Snapshot of self-assembled chains of
the PMA–PTX–CDDP conjugate after 500 ns simulation time.
Water is not shown for clarity. (c,d) RDFs between similar types and
different types of residues averaged over 10 ns of simulation time,
respectively. (e) Distribution of the number of interchain hydrogen
bonds in the polymer over last 10 ns of simulation time. (f) Distribution
of number of different types of polymer–water hydrogen bonds
over last 10 ns of simulation time.

To evaluate the interaction between hydrophobic (PTX) and
hydrophilic
(CDDP, COOH) residues near each other, the radial distribution function
(RDF) between similar types as well as different types of residues
were calculated (Tables S1–S3). Figure 3c clearly delineated
that polymeric COOH groups remained closest to each other (within
0.5 nm), whereas CDDP residues remained more distant from each other
(∼0.6 nm and higher). By contrast, as expected hydrophobic
PTX residues were not found to be aggregated. On the other hand, RDF
between different types of residues showed sharp peaks between hydrophilic
CDDP and COOH groups (Figure 3d). Additionally, hydrophobic PTX showed interactions to a
lesser extent with hydrophilic COOH and CDDP residues because of their
hydrophobic mismatch and steric bulk. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding
interaction between polymer chains may play a role in the process
of self-assembly. The different types of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor
sites like −OH, −NH, and −C=O are present
in the polymer chain. This gives rises to the possibility of formation
of hydrogen bonds in between different monomers of the same polymer
chain (intramolecular) and in between different chains (intermolecular).
The distance distribution was calculated between different possible
H-bonding donor and acceptor sites (−OH, −NH–,
and −CO−), which showed that H-bonds formed only in
between −OH and −CO– groups (Figure S9). Further calculation over
10 ns of simulation time revealed six interchains, an insignificant
number of intrachains, and a high number of H-bonds to be formed with
water molecules (Figure 3e,f). This MD simulation study illustrated the self-assembly of the
PMA–PTX–CDDP polymer into nanoparticles through the
interpolymer chain H-bonding and hydrophilic–hydrophilic interaction
between COOH and CDDP residues.

2.3 Cellular
Internalization and Drug Release
2.3.1 Cellular
Internalization
For effective
delivery of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs together, the nanovector
needs to be internalized inside the cancer cells. To visualize the
self-assembled polymeric nanoparticles inside the cells, red fluorescent
rhodamine-isothiocyanate (RITC) was tagged with PMAn through the ethylenediamine
(ED) linker. First, the anhydride moiety of PMAn (1)
was opened up using the ED linker [PMAn/ED = 1:5 molar ratio] to obtain
the PMAn–ED conjugate (5) (Figure S10). RITC (6) was further reacted with
free amine moiety of the PMAn–ED conjugate (5)
to obtain the RITC-labeled PMAn–RITC conjugate (7) (PMAn–ED/RITC = 1:5 molar ratio). Both conjugates 5 and 7 were characterized by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (Figures S11 and S12). The
anhydride moieties of the PMAn−RITC conjugate (7) were opened up by using dimethyl formamide (DMF)/water mixture
(1:1) at 60 °C for 48 h to obtain the PMAn−RITC conjugate
(8), which was further conjugated with PTX and CDDP sequentially
(PTX/CDDP = 1:4 molar ratio) to afford the PMAc−RITC−PTX−CDDP
conjugate (9) (Figure S10).
Expectedly, the PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP conjugate (9) self-assembled into the nanoparticles, which was confirmed
by FESEM and AFM images along with energy dispersive analysis of X-rays
for the confirmation of CDDP in the nanoparticles (Figures S13 and S14). MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated
with PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs in a time-dependent
manner (0, 3, 6 h) followed by staining nuclei and lysosomes with
Hoechst 33342 (blue) and LysoTracker DND-26 (green), respectively.
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images clearly showed that
internalization of red fluorescent PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs
was almost negligible in MCF7 cells at 0 h (Figure 4, topmost panel) having an undetectable red
fluorescence signal. However, with time, PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs
internalized into MCF7 cells and localized into lysosomes in 3 and
6 h yielding merged yellow regions from LysoTracker green and red
fluorescent nanoparticles observed in CLSM images (Figure 4, middle and lowermost panels).
Hence, from these CLSM images it was confirmed that RITC-labeled PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
were taken up by the breast cancer cells within 3 h and homed into
acidic lysosomes. We further quantified the red fluorescence signals
inside the cells at 0, 3, and 6 h using confocal microscopy. The quantification
revealed that the red fluorescence intensity increased significantly
at 3 h compared to 0 h (Figure S15). However,
we found a negligible change in the subcellular red fluorescence intensity
at 6 h compared to 3 h. This quantification corroborated that PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs
internalized into MCF7 cells within 3 h.

Figure 4 Confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM) images of MCF7 cells
treated with PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs (red) in a
time-dependent manner (0, 3, and 6 h). Nucleus and lysosomes were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) and LysoTracker DND-26 (green),
respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.

2.3.2 Drug Release
The acidic environment
inside lysosomes would lead to release the active hydrophobic and
hydrophilic drugs by cleavage of the acid labile ester and Pt–O
coordination chemical linkages in PTX and CDDP, respectively.38,39 To evaluate the release of active drugs, the nanoparticles were
incubated into pH = 5.5 buffer (lysosome mimic) and dual drug release
was quantified by UV–vis spectroscopy in different time points
at characteristic λmax = 273 and 706 nm for PTX and
CDDP, respectively, from the absorbance versus concentration calibration
graph. It was observed that 79.9 ± 4.1% and 54.9 ± 6.5%
of PTX and CDDP were released slowly from the nanoparticles after
72 h, respectively (Figure 5a). Ideally, the nanoparticle should not release its payload
under physiological conditions before reaching the targeted tumor
tissues. To evaluate the dual drug release under physiological conditions,
we incubated PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs into phosphate buffer
saline (PBS, pH = 7.4) and quantified the release of PTX and CDDP
by UV–vis spectroscopy. It was observed that only 29.5 ±
2.4% and 50.0 ± 6% of CDDP and PTX were released even after 72
h at pH = 7.4 (Figure 5b). From these release studies, it was evident that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
released payload in the acidic environment in much improved quantities
compared to physiological conditions in a slow and controlled manner
over 3 days, which would be ideal for successful delivery of PTX and
CDDP into tumor tissues for augmented therapeutic outcome.

active PTX and CDDP from PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
at (a) acidic pH = 5.5 (mimicking subcellular lysosomes) and (b) physiological
pH = 7.4 in a time-dependent manner over 72 h.

2.4 Targeting Nucleus and Microtubules
2.4.1 Nuclear Fragmentation
Acidic environment-mediated
cleavage of PTX and CDDP from nanoparticles would target subcellular
microtubules and DNA residing in nuclei, respectively.40−43 We evaluated the ability of PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs to damage
subcellular nuclei. MCF-7 cells were treated with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
temporally (6, 24, and 48 h), followed by staining tubulin and nuclei
with α-tubulin antibody (green) and Hoechst 33342 (blue), respectively.
As control, MCF-7 cells were treated with free PTX and CDDP cocktail
having the same ratio in nanoparticles. CLSM images in Figure 6 clearly revealed that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
induced nuclear fragmentation in a time-dependent manner (Figure 6). In comparison,
the free drug cocktail also fragmented the nuclei of MCF7 cells in
a manner very similar to the nanoparticle treatment (Figure S16). We further quantified the fragmented cellular
nuclei induced by the free drug cocktail or nanoparticles using confocal
microscopy in different incubation times. It was observed that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
induced a similar nuclear damage (20.4 ± 8.8% and 43.4 ±
2.8%, respectively) compared to free drug cocktail treatments (16.7
± 5.4% and 34.36 ± 5.8%, respectively) (Figure S17) at 24 and 48 h postincubation.

Figure 6 CLSM images of MCF7 cells
after treatment with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
showing nuclear fragmentation at 6, 24, and 48 h. Nucleus and tubulin
were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) and Alexa Fluor-labeled tubulin
antibody (green), respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.

2.4.2 Stalled Cell Division
by the Microtubule
Damage
Moreover, PTX binds with microtubules to stabilize
them leading to the inhibition of cell division in the mitosis stage.44,45 To evaluate the effect of PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs on cell
division, MCF-7 cells were treated with nanoparticles at 6 and 24
h. Nucleus and tubulin were stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) and
α-tubulin antibody (green), respectively, followed by visualization
through fluorescence confocal microscopy. CLSM images in Figure 7 showed the characteristic
damaged microtubule and stalled cell division in the mitosis stage
leading to the accumulation of genomic materials in the nucleus after
treatment with the nanoparticles at both 6 and 24 h. We have observed
a similar microtubule damage and accumulation of genomic materials
in the central part of cells in free PTX and CDDP cocktail treatment
(Figure S18). We further quantified the
number of cells with stalled cell division using confocal microscopy.
It was revealed that 24 h of nanoparticle treatment induced stalled
division in 22% of the cells whereas only 7% of cells that were treated
with free PTX and CDDP cocktail exhibited stalled division (Figure S19).The remarkable increase in the stalled
cell division upon nanoparticle treatment compared to free drug combination
can be attributed to the simultaneous improved cellular internalization
of PTX and CDDP through nanoparticles. By contrast, free PTX and CDDP
have vastly different aqueous solubility leading to the erratic cellular
internalization in right dosages to interact with their respective
subcellular targets.

Figure 7 CLSM images of MCF7 cells after treatment with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
showing stalled cell division at 6 and 24 h. Nucleus and tubulin were
stained with Hoechst 33342 (blue) and Alexa Fluor-labeled tubulin
antibody (green), respectively. Scale bar = 20 μm.

2.5 Reduction of 3D-Breast
Cancer Spheroids
Nanoparticle-mediated fragmentation of nucleus
and inhibition of
cell division lead to cellular death. To assess the effect of nanoparticles
on the cancer cell death, MCF-7 cells were incubated with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
in a dose-dependent manner for 24 h, and cell viability was measured
by the MTT assay. As control, MCF7 cells were treated with free PTX
and CDDP combination. Interestingly, PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
induced cell death with IC50 = 0.29 μM (Figure S20a). By contrast, free drug combination
showed much higher IC50 = 4.06 μM compared to nanoparticle
treatment. For successful translation of the nanoplatforms having
multiple drugs as payload, the vector should not show any toxicity
profile itself. To investigate the toxicity profile of our polymer
vector PMAn, we treated MCF7 cells with PMAn in a dose-dependent manner
for 24 h and evaluated the cell viability with the MTT assay. Interestingly,
PMAn showed negligible cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells even at 10 μM
concentration after 24 h (Figure S20b).
This cell viability assay clearly indicated that PMAn has potential
for further translation to clinics.

Finally, we evaluated the
effect of the nanoparticles in 3-dimensional cultures as in vivo mimic.
MCF7 cells were grown over Matrigel to develop 3-dimensional spheroids
over 8 days. 3D-MCF7 spheroids were treated with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
for 24 h, and the spheroids were allowed to grow for 16 more days.
Finally, the nuclei and actin in 3D-MCF7 spheroids were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (blue) and Alexa Fluor-labeled phalloidin 568 (red),
respectively. The spheroids were visualized by CLSM. Figure 8 evidently showed that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
reduced the size of the MCF7 spheroids significantly compared to non-nanoparticle-treated
MCF7 spheroids. We further quantified the 3D-MCF7 breast tumor spheroids
by measuring the surface area and volume of the acini. It was observed
that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs remarkably reduced the surface
area and volume of 3D-MCF7-spheroids (Figure S21). The reduction in the size of the acini can be attributed to either
cell death or inhibition of cell division. Thus, taking into consideration
the results of the cytotoxicity assay as well as the 3D spheroid assay,
it can be concluded that PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs killed the
MCF7 breast cancer cells extraordinarily with no significant toxicity
for the starting polymeric vector used for dual drug conjugation.

Scale bar = 50 μm.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, this present
work demonstrates the unique CDDP-induced
self-assembly of linear polymers into spherical nanoparticles which
can encompass hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs simultaneously. The
essential mechanism for self-assembly was determined by MD simulation
and found to be the interaction between hydrophilic moieties as well
as interpolymer chain H-bonding. These hydrophobic–hydrophilic
drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles were taken up by the breast cancer
cells into lysosomes, leading to nuclear fragmentation and stalled
cell division in mitosis by inhibiting microtubule formation. The
nanoparticles demonstrated a remarkable cell death in vitro as well
as a 3D-tumor spheroid model. We foresee that our new approach of
polymeric nanoparticles has an immense potential for future translation
into clinics for combination therapy in breast cancer.

with EDC (1.83 mg, 0.0096 mmol) and DMAP (0.77 mg, 0.00064 mmol) for
30 min at room temperature. PTX (2.7 mg, 0.0032 mmol) was added in
the reaction mixture and stirred for 24 h. The reaction was quenched
with 4 mL of water followed by dialysis (MWCO = 3.5 kDa) against water
for 24 h. The PMA–RITC–PTX conjugate was obtained as
a solid powder after lyophilization. The PMA–RITC–PTX
conjugate (10 mg, 0.00069 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL DMF and aquated
CDDP (3.5 mg, 0.00138 mmol) was added into the reaction mixture. The
reaction was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The reaction was
quenched with 4 mL of water and PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP
conjugate 9 was purified by dialysis against water for
24 h followed by lyophilization to afford the solid product.

4.9 Size, Shape, and Morphology of the Self-Assembled
Nanoparticles
The size, shape, and morphology of the nanoparticles
were determined by DLS, FESEM, AFM, and TEM. Sample preparation was
performed by the protocol mentioned in ref (47).

4.10 Determination of the Critical
Aggregation
Constant (CAC)
Pyrene (2.5 × 10–5 mol
L–1) in acetone was added to 10 different vials,
and acetone was evaporated. Different amounts of PMA–PTX–CDDP
conjugate 4 were added to the above vials followed by
the addition of 2 mL of water. The vials were subjected to sonication
for 10 min. The fluorescence emission spectra of all samples were
recorded on an LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Co.)
at 337 nm excitation wavelength and 4 nm slit width. The I3/I1 values of all solution
were recorded and plotted against concentration.

4.11 Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The
polymer chain considered for MD simulation consists of three different
monomers. Two substituting groups of different hydrophobicity are
attached to the backbone PMA chain with 1:4 molar ratio resulting
in three types of monomers. These three monomers are designated as
A in which the substituting group is hydrophobic PTX, B where the
square planar ammonia, oxo-platinum complex which is hydrophilic in
nature attached through its oxygen atoms, and C where there is no
substitution.

4.11.1 Preparation of the Polymer
Chain
Geometry-optimized (using Gaussian 09 for quantum chemical
QM calculations48) individual monomers
are taken for building
the polymer chain. Monomer A and monomer C are QM-optimized using
B3LYP functional and 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The optimization of monomer
B is performed by using B3LYP functional and mixed basis set of 6-311G(d,p)
for nontransition metal atoms and LANL2DZ with MWB60 core potential
for Pt atoms. These QM-optimized monomers are randomly connected to
build the polymer chain.

4.11.2 Force Field for the
Polymer
The
bonded and nonbonded parameters of the PMA backbone are taken from CHARMM36 force field.49,50 The force field parameters of PTX are collected from the work of
Kulkarni et al.,51 which is CHARMM-based
force field. However, because of the unavailability of parameters
for the square planar Pt-complex in CHARMM force field, the bonded
parameters of square planar Pt [(NH3)2–O)2] group taken from the work on the
oxaliplatin complex by Cundari et al.52 We have calculated parameters which were not available in the literature.
The harmonic angle constant (Kθ)
of N–Pt–O, was calculated by performing QM calculations
with varying angles. As the parameters of Pt–coordinated O–carbonyl
C angle are corresponding to C (alkane)–X–Y parameter, these are taken from CHARMM36 force field.
The dihedral angle potential parameters associated with Pt were taken
from Cundari et al.52 The dihedral parameters
for coordinated ammine H–coordinated N–Pt–coordinated
ammine N were calculated by QM. All the calculated parameters are
given in the Tables S2 and S3. The other
dihedrals which are not associated with Pt atoms were taken from CHARMM36
force field. The nonbonded Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential parameters
(σii and εii) for Pt and coordinated
N were taken from the work of Scheeff et al.53 The partial charges of atoms in monomer B were calculated by QM
using the Marciniak and Kuczynski (MK) method using the same basis
set as mentioned above and given in Table S1.54

4.11.3 Solvation
of Polymer Chains in Water
All the MD simulations were carried
out using GROMACS-4.6.3 package.37 Each
polymer chain consists of A5B20C15 monomers. The polymer chains were solvated
in water and energy minimized using the steepest descent algorithm
to avoid overlaps of the atomic coordinates. Then, simulated annealing
steps (SA) were performed in the temperature range of 300–550
K to reach energetically lower conformation of polymer chains. The
conformation obtained after 6 cycles of SA was taken for randomly
packing nine such polymer chains into a simulation box of lengths
9.9, 9.55, 9.02 nm in X, Y, and Z directions. Then, the polymer chains are solvated with
an extended simple point charge model55 of water molecules so that the weight ratio of polymer and water
becomes 1:3.2. Then, the system is energy-minimized using the steepest
descent method. Pressure was maintained at 1 bar with Berendsen Barostat56 by applying coupling constant of 1 ps. A Berendsen
thermostat was employed to keep the temperature at 300 K by using
the coupling constant value of 0.1 ps. The van der Waals interaction
between nonbonded atoms were evaluated using the LJ 12-6 potential
up to a cut-off distance of 1.2 nm. The electrostatic interaction
was calculated with a cut-off value of 1.2 nm. Long-range electrostatic
interactions were treated by the particle-mesh Ewald method.57 Then, the polymer–water system was energy-minimized
and the NPT simulation was carried out for 500 ns. The last 10 ns
of trajectory was analyzed for calculating the distance distribution
between the COM between PTX monomers and the RDF between the COM of
similar and different types of monomers and the number of interchains
and polymer–water hydrogen bonds. The MD simulation was performed
on self-assembled polymers in water. We have analyzed the reason behind
the self-assembly of polymer in water.

4.11.4 Determination
of Hydrogen Bonding Interaction
Sites
The distances between the hydrogen bond and hydrogen
bond acceptor sites are calculated for different possible hydrogen
bonding sites present in the polymer chain. These distances are calculated
over the last 10 ns of trajectory and converted into their histograms,
normalized with the number of frames (Figure S13a). The −OH···O=C pair of interaction
only falls under the distance criteria for the hydrogen bond formation
(<0.26 nm) and is shown in Figure S13a. The angle distributions corresponding to these pairs have been
calculated (Figure S13b), which shows that
the hydroxyl O–hydroxyl H–carbonyl oxygen O angle falls
under the criteria (>130°) of hydrogen bonding. The number
of
these hydrogen bonds are calculated and described in the main text.

4.12 MTT Cytotoxicity Assay
MCF7 cells
were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. MCF7 cells were seeded
at a density of 0.5 × 104 cells per well in a 96-well
flat-bottomed tissue-culture-treated plate in DMEM. The cells were
maintained for 16 h at 37 °C. Varying doses of the PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs
were added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. Media was aspirated
and freshly prepared 0.5 mg/mL of MTT solution diluted in DMEM was
added to cells. Following 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium
was aspirated and the formazan crystals formed were dissolved by adding
100 μL of DMSO. Absorbance was measured on a Varioskan Flash
multimode plate reader (Thermo Scientific) at 570 nm.

4.13 Internalization Studies
MCF7 cells
were seeded on coverslips at a density of 5 × 105 cells
per well of a 6-well dish and incubated overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were treated with PMA–RITC–PTX–CDDP-NPs
for 0, 3, and 6 h. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min
at 4 °C. Lysosomes were labeled by incubating the cells with
LysoTracker Green DND-26 at 37 °C for 45 min. This was followed
by three washes with PBS, and the nuclei were counterstained with
Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. SlowFade Gold antifade
was used to mount the slides, and the images were captured in a LSM710
laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, GmbH) using a 63×-oil
objective.

4.14 3D Cultures
MCF7
cells were seeded
in 8-well chambered coverglass coated with 50 μL of Matrigel
at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well.58,59 The cultures were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C
in DMEM supplemented with estradiol (0.1 nM), insulin (250 ng/mL),
and hydrocortisone (1.4 μM). The culture was replenished with
fresh media every 4 days. PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs were added
to the spheroids on day 8 for 24 h, and then the culture was further
maintained till day 16.

4.15 Immunofluorescence
MCF7 cells treated
with PMA–PTX–CDDP-NPs and free PTX–CDDP cocktails
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min
followed by permeabilization at 4 °C using 0.5% Triton-X 100.
Blocking was done in the IF buffer containing 10% goat serum. α-Tubulin
antibody was added in 1:5000 dilution, and the cells were incubated
overnight at 4 °C. Following washes, Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary
antibodies were added. After 1 h of incubation, nuclei were counterstained
with Hoechst 33342, and coverslips were mounted using SlowFade Gold
antifade mounting media and visualized under a 63× objective
of the LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, GmbH).

Fragmented nucleus and unfragmented nucleus were observed and manually
classified into the two groups. The percentage was calculated taking
into consideration the number of cells showing fragmented nucleus
as well as the total number of cells imaged from randomly selected
fields.

16 day 3D cultures were subjected to immunofluorescence
as per
standard protocols. Briefly, the cultures were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilizing with 0.5%
Triton-X at 4 °C for 10 min. This was followed by blocking and
incubation with Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin 568, and the nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. Images were captured with
the LSM710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, GmbH) using
a 25×-oil objective.

The confocal images were analyzed
for volume of acini using Huygens
Professional Software (SVI, Hilversum, Netherlands). Graphs were plotted
and statistical analysis was done using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
