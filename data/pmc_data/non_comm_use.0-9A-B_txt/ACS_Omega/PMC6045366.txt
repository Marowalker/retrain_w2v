The
present work describes the improved photocatalytic activity
of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-assisted Bi2WO6 (CBTH) toward the synthesis of bioactive benzazoles. X-ray
diffraction analysis of CBTH suggests that crystal growth has occurred
along the (200) plane, whereas field-emission scanning electron microscopy
images confirm two-dimensional rose bud morphology and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy analysis suggests the formation of
thin nanosheets possessing an orthorhombic structure. Temperature-programmed
desorption of ammonia and Py-IR measurements indicate substantial
acidity with the generation of Brønsted acid sites on the surface
of CBTH. Raman spectra of CBTH also corroborate these observations
with the formation of defects within [Bi2O2]2+ layers, resulting in decreased thickness and shapes of nanoplates.
These beneficial properties are explored toward the photochemical
synthesis of benzazoles using a 35 W tungsten lamp and a CBTH photocatalyst,
resulting in better yields at lesser exposure time. It is observed
that the catalytic activity is retained up to five consecutive cycles
with marginal decrease in % yield. Such a feature can be ascribed
to the photostability of the photocatalyst even after continuous exposure
to light, implying that the surface active sites remained unaltered
as evident from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of pre-
and post-characterization of CBTH. Moreover, decrease in the surface
hydroxyl groups after five catalytic cycles also accounts for the
generation of enhanced Brønsted sites owing to the presence of
Bi–O on the surface of CBTH. It exhibits better catalytic activity
as compared to other photocatalysts employed for the synthesis of
benzazoles. Thus, CBTH serves as a robust photocatalyst for the facile
synthesis of these heterocycles in a sustainable manner.

Introduction
Photocatalysis is a
process that involves effective utilization
of light for various applications such as environmental remediation,
solar energy absorption, H2 generation, sequestering of
CO2, biomass conversion, and green synthesis of commodity
chemicals.1 This phenomenon is manifested
by a photocatalyst that efficiently absorbs the radiation, thereby
generating an electron–hole pair which is responsible for the
oxidation or reduction of substrates in an eco-friendly manner. Various
semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been explored for this purpose
with major emphasis on the utilization of their potentiality under
visible light.2 For example, TiO2 is one of the most promising photocatalysts that has been employed
for photocatalytic processes including organic transformations.3 Primarily, photoactivation of organic substrates
is a key step in light-driven photochemical transformations using
semiconductor-based photocatalysts that efficiently bring about chemical
conversions with high selectivity. Benzazoles are one such chemical
moiety that have been synthesized via a photochemical route with excellent
yields under either UV or visible light.

Classically, azoles
are synthesized by the condensation of aryl
aminophenol/α-diamine/aminothiophenol with acids or aldehydes
in an oxidizing atmosphere. Although these methodologies are effective,
serious environmental concerns such as generation of secondary waste,
use of hazardous reagents, and tedious workups have restricted their
potential applicability at the industrial scale. Catalytic processes
have gained prominence owing to their effectiveness, selectivity,
and sustainability. Among them, heterogeneous catalysis is found to
be a viable alternative that can overcome lacunas of both conventional
and homogeneous catalytic routes.4 One
of the offshoots of the heterogeneous catalyst focuses on the absorption
of light via the photocatalytic process involving a photocatalyst
that efficiently transfers the absorbed energy for organic conversions.
For example, various homogeneous photocatalysts have been explored
for the synthesis of heterocycles under visible light that has resulted
in moderate to excellent yields, although catalyst separation and
its successive usage are some of the demerits.5−8 On the other hand, heterogeneous
photocatalysts have recently been considered as the better alternative
that can overcome these shortcomings. TiO2, a prominent,
UV-active, and environmental benign photocatalyst, yielded substituted
benzimidazoles using nitroaniline and aldehyde; however, the reaction
proceeds under UV light and the yields are comparatively poor.9 Doping of noble metals such as Au, Ag, and Pt
shifts the band gap in the visible light which is beneficial for the
preparation of substituted benzazoles. Nanocomposites, such as Pt/TiO2,10,11 Ag/TiO2,12 and Au/TiO2,13 exhibit better
photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles.
The potentiality of metal chalcogenides such as CdSe, CdTe, ZnS, 
CdS etc. is well-explored as photocatalysts in various reactions such
as dye degradation, water splitting, and organic transformations.14 For example, Das et al. demonstrated that CdS
nanospheres can be effectively used for the synthesis of 2-substituted
benzothiazoles.15

Azoles are a key
moiety in the core structure of many pharmacophoric
molecules that act as a precursor for a variety of drugs exhibiting
a wide range of biological activities such as anticancer, bactericidal,
fungicidal, analgesic, and antiviral properties. Some of these derivatives
possess therapeutic usages against cardiovascular diseases.16 Among azoles, imidazoles are common scaffolds
for different biomolecules such as biotin, a key amino acid histidine,
histamine, the pilocarpine alkaloids, and other alkaloids,17 whereas 5,6-dimethyl-1-(α-d-ribofuranosyl)
benzimidazole is an important biological building block of vitamin
B12.18 Esomeprazole and lansoprazole
are well-known derivatives of benzimidazoles, which act as proton-pump
inhibitors whose mode of action involves pronounced and long-lasting
decrease in gastric acid production.19 Besides
the medicinal/biological applications, benzimidazole derivatives such
as 2-methylbenzimidazole and 2-mercaptobenzimidazole have also been
used as corrosion inhibitors.20 Some of
the derivatives of benzothiazoles act as enzyme inhibitors21 and plant growth regulators.22 Benzimidazoles23,24 and benzothiazoles25 are also used in fluorescent materials such
as organic light-emitting diodes.

Considering these aspects,
an attempt has been made toward the
visible-light-induced facile synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothioazoles
using robust CTAB-assisted Bi2WO6 (CBTH) as
a photocatalyst. This mixed metal oxide belonging to Aurivillius oxide
family26 is well-explored for its photocatalytic
activity toward water splitting.27 It
also exhibits excellent property toward light-driven remediation of
organic pollutants via the oxidative mechanism28−30 and selective
oxidation of aromatic alcohols.31 Compared
to other photocatalysts, this material is resistant to photocorrosion
as well as harsh reaction conditions that enable its effectiveness
as a photocatalyst for organic synthesis with better conversion and
excellent reusability.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization
of the Photocatalyst
The
X-ray diffraction pattern of hydrothermally synthesized Bi2WO6 (BTH) and CBTH is shown in Figure 1. Comparison of these two patterns suggests
that there exist dissimilarities for the intensity and broadness of
the individual peak. For example, the peak at 32.89° corresponding
to (200) is broadened with increased intensity at the expense of decrease
in the intensity for the (131) plane observed at 28.27°. It implies
that the epitaxial growth of BTH along the latter plane is arrested
with concomitant expansion along the former plane owing to the addition
of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). A similar feature is also
found to be associated with other peaks appearing at 47.09°,
55.93°, 58.60°, 68.77°, 75.92°, and 78.37°
corresponding to (202)/(260), (133)/(331), (262), (400), (102), and
(204) crystallographic planes, respectively. It resembles a perovskite-like
structure indexed to an orthorhombic Bi2WO6 phase
with lattice parameters a = 5.461 Å, b = 5.431 Å, and c = 16.422 Å.
The morphology and microstructure of BTH and CBTH are investigated
by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and TEM analyses.
The FESEM image of BTH (Figure 2a) displays nanoplates that are arranged in two dimensions
with the thickness of about 200 nm, whereas high-magnification FESEM
image (Figure 2b) clearly
reveals the formation of thin nanoplates displaying very thin and
two-dimensional (2D) microstructures. On the other hand, when Bi2WO6 is coated with CTAB, layers of nanoflakes are
formed (Figure 2c)
that are arranged in a manner similar to the tip of the rose bud (Figure 2d). This observation
is further supported by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images of both nanocrystals (Figure 3). The formation of elongated cubical morphology
such as a nanochip is seen in the absence of CTAB, whereas its presence
has significantly modified the shape of BTH nanocrystals into 2D nanosheets
with smaller thickness. Such a feature has already been noted for
the CTAB-assisted hydrothermal synthesis of Bi2WO6 where the monolayer formation of Bi2WO6 nanocrystals
is achieved by controlling the amount of CTAB added during the hydrothermal
synthesis.32 In our case, the top-down
approach seems to be feasible as CTAB has resulted in the formation
of 2D nanosheets.

d value [inset selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern];

The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) analysis provides the total acidity in terms of NH3 desorbed on the surface of the photocatalyst (Figure 4). It is observed that the
total acidity
of BTH has increased from 0.06529 to 0.10462 mmol/g with CTAB coating.
Such a two-fold enhancement can be ascribed to the formation of thin
layers of BTH that are well-separated from each other in a dispersed
manner. Furthermore, these nanosheets with proper edges may account
for improved acidity. Also, broad peaks at higher temperature signified
the generation of Brønsted acidic sites on the surface of CBTH.
These observations are further substantiated with Py-IR absorption
analysis of both catalysts (Figure 5). The Py-IR spectra of BTH exhibit multiple peaks
in the region of 1450–1650 cm–1 with prominent
bands at 1640 and 1596 cm–1 owing to Brønsted
acidity, whereas Lewis acidic sites are observed at 1539 and 1487
cm–1. Upon interaction with CTAB, the number of
peaks have decreased; however, the nature and positions of peaks corresponding
to Brønsted sites remained almost the same, whereas there exists
a slight change in the nature and position of the peaks corresponding
to Lewis sites. It implies that functionalization of surface hydroxyls
present on BTH has occurred as a consequence of interaction with CTAB
without altering the Brønsted sites. This observation is further
corroborated with IR spectra (Figure S1) where it is observed that CBTH exhibits distinct peaks in the region
of 1500–3000 cm–1 owing to the coating of
CTAB on the surface of Bi2WO6.

CBTH.

Figure 5 Py-IR of (a) BTH, (b) CBTH, and (c) reused CBTH.

The Raman spectra of BTH exhibit
a characteristic broad peak (Figure 6) at 791 cm–1 with a small hump at
821 cm–1 attributed to symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibrations between planar W and O atoms.33 Interestingly, the former peak is retained in
CBTH with decreased width, whereas the latter band splits into two
resolved peaks. A similar feature is also observed for the peak at
716 cm–1 that exhibits a splitted pattern due to
the distortion in W–O interaction owing to size reduction.34 A band at 635 cm–1 due to
the stretching mode of [Bi2O2]2+ disappeared
upon interaction with CTAB, which clearly suggests that the nanosheets
are situated within the framework of WO6 octahedrons.35 Similarly, vibrations in the region of 100–450
cm–1 for BTH are mainly attributed to stretching
or bending modes of WO6 octahedron and BiO6 polyhedron,
and Bi–O peaks split into more prominent bands as a consequence
of addition of CTAB.36 Furthermore, it
is observed that CTAB induces decrease in the thickness as well as
disordered morphology for Bi2WO6 sheets. Thus,
it may be argued that CTAB is indeed responsible for structural modifications
that has resulted in the formation of defects within WO6 octahedron with decrease in the thickness and shapes of nanoplates.

Catalyst Screening
The photocatalytic efficiency of
BTH and CBTH photocatalysts is explored toward the photochemical synthesis
of substituted benzothiazoles and benzimidazoles under visible light.
For this purpose, optimized reaction conditions are evaluated for
the synthesis of benzazoles using o-aminothiophenol
and benzaldehyde (Table S1). It is interesting
to note that CBTH exhibits an enhanced photocatalytic activity as
compared to BTH. For example, there is a significant improvement in
the yield with lesser exposure time for CBTH, implying that surface
modification has resulted in better reaction rates. It is reported
that CTAB coating reduces the band gap of BTH by about 0.2 eV generating
holes on the active surface and electrons that are situated in
the middle layer of the photocatalyst. This induces effective charge
separation and both these moieties are responsible for better catalytic
activity. Thus, CBTH is selected for further studies toward the synthesis
of benzazoles. Studies on the variation in the amount of CBTH, viz.,
3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg, suggest that an increase in the yield of
the product with concomitant increase in the catalyst amount with
maximum yield (94%) is obtained at 15 mg of the photocatalyst. The
solvent study carried out using an optimum amount (15 mg) of the catalyst
indicates that acetonitrile is the most suitable solvent for this
particular reaction as it is observed that acetonitrile can stabilize
photogenerated radicals during exposure to light (Figure S2). Thus, 15 mg of the photocatalyst with a 35 W tungsten
lamp and acetonitrile solvent are found to be optimum conditions for
the photochemical conversion of o-aminothiophenol
and benzaldehyde to corresponding benzothiazoles, and similar conditions
are adopted for the synthesis of benzimidazoles.

Adopting these
optimized conditions, the scope of the present investigation is evaluated
toward the photochemical synthesis of 2-substituted benzothiazoles
(Table 1) and 2-substituted
benzimidazoles (Table 2) under identical experimental conditions. It is observed that the
formation of benzothiazoles takes place at considerably lesser exposure
time (30–90 min) as compared to their benzimidazole analogues
(3–5.5 h). Also, the yields are significantly higher (89–96%)
for thiazoles, whereas comparatively lower yields (81–96%)
are obtained for imidazoles. These variations can be attributed to
the easier homolytic cleavage of the S–H bond as compared to
that of the N–H bond, which leads to the facile generation
of radicals on the sulfur center. Within the individual series, there
seems to be the influence of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
substituents on the exposure time and yield. For example, nitro and
fluoro substituents favor better yields at faster reaction rates,
whereas hydroxyl and methoxy derivatives induce comparatively lower
yields at longer exposure time for both the series. This occurs because
of the increased electrophilic character of the carbonyl group of
the aldehyde, resulting in its stronger adsorption on the catalyst
surface and thereby lowering the activation energy.

Reusability Studies
It is observed that the photocatalytic
activity of a catalyst may be hampered after its continuous exposure
to light owing to photocorrosion that results in the lowering of yield
of the product during successive cycles. To assess this hypothesis,
longevity studies of the CBTH catalyst are evaluated toward the synthesis
of 2-phenyl benzimidazoles for five successive cycles (Figure 7). After each cycle, the catalyst
is centrifuged, washed with acetone or ethanol to remove traces of
any adsorbed organic molecule, and subsequently used for the next
cycle. Interestingly, % yield of the 2-phenyl benzimidazoles remains
almost constant after five cycles, suggesting that the catalyst remains
active even after it is continuously exposed to visible light. This
also infers to the robustness and photostability of the photocatalyst
under severe reaction conditions involving active reactants as well
as its surface that remained almost unchanged during chemical transformation.
To substantiate these assumptions, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis is carried out for fresh and used CBTH catalyst after
five cycles (Figure 8). Inspection of this figure reveals that there exist two regions
corresponding to Bi3+ and W6+ constituents of
CBTH. The peaks at 159.12 and 164.41 eV are assigned to 4f(7/2) and 4f(5/2) spin states, respectively, originating from
the Bi3+ ion (Figure 8a), whereas the spin states at the W6+ region
(Figure 8b) displayed
the peaks at 35.36 and 37.50 eV for the fresh CBTH catalyst. On the
other hand, these peaks are shifted to higher binding energy by ∼0.45
eV for the used catalyst that may be ascribed to the formation of
oxygen vacancies.37 Such a minor shift
in the binding energy for Bi3+ and W6+ ions
may arise due to continuous exposure to light, generating small defects
on the surface of CBTH. This observation is further corroborated with
O 1s spectra of the fresh and used CBTH photocatalyst (Figure S3). Three-peak patterns for this region
are observed at 530.11, 531.97, and 533.39 eV which are assigned to
W–O, surface hydroxyl, and Bi–O moieties, respectively.38 Interestingly, these peaks are shifted to higher
energy by about 0.4 eV for the used catalyst, a feature noted for
Bi3+ and W6+ ions. Also, the peak intensity
of surface hydroxyl is found to be decreased with concomitant increase
in the intensity for the Bi–O peak for the used catalyst, although
the intensity of the W–O peak remains almost constant. These
changes may be ascribed to the increase in the contribution from Bi–O
toward the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the CBTH
catalyst. Further, it also substantiates the structural arrangement
of Bi2WO6 where the surface vacancies are generated
because of [Bi2O2]2+ sheets present
on the surface while WO6 octahedron functions as the source
of electron.32 This aspect is indeed responsible
for the improved photocatalytic activity of CBTH because of its nanosheet
morphology as compared to flake-like morphology for BTH.

Figure 7 Reusability
studies of the CBTH photocatalyst toward the synthesis
of 2-phenyl benzimidazoles.

Figure 8 XPS spectra of the fresh and used CBTH photocatalyst: Bi region
(a,c) and W region (b,d).

To further corroborate these findings, NH3-TPD
and Py-IR
(Figure 5c) spectral
measurements are carried out for the recovered catalyst. It is interesting
to note that there is absence of lower temperature peaks (Figure 4c) corresponding
to weak acidic sites, implying that CTAB coating may have disappeared
with an appearance of a broad peak at higher temperature owing to
the generation of strong Brønsted sites as evident from the enhancement
in the total acidity by almost 2.5 times (0.2803 mmol/g) after its
successive usage. Moreover, such an increase in the total acidity
is found to be beneficial as it accelerates the Schiff base formation,
a key step in the synthesis of benzazoles that has resulted in retaining
the photocatalytic activity of CBTH even after five successive cycles.
Significantly, Py-IR measurements also confirm the presence of broad
unresolved peaks at a higher wave number for CBTH as a result of lowering
in the Lewis acidic sites. It can also be inferred that the increased
surface hydroxyl groups are responsible for the enhanced Brønsted
acidity as evident from the enhanced intensity for the O 1s peak evaluated
from the XPS analysis of the used catalyst (Figure S3).

Plausible Mechanism
Bi2WO6 being
a metal oxide plays a dual role of a Lewis acid as well as a photocatalyst
during the course of photocyclization. The first step involves the
formation of Schiff’s base which is followed by photocyclization
of the imine intermediate, yielding the desired product in a sequential
manner (Figure 9a).
The Lewis acidity of CBTH is responsible for the formation of Schiff’s
base, whereas the photoconducting nature of the catalyst generates
a radical on the heteroatom that initiates the cyclization process.
Adsorption of the aldehyde on the catalyst surface increases the electrophilicity
of the carbonyl group, followed by the nucleophilic attack of the
amino group on the electron-deficient carbonyl center. The photogenerated
radical then cleaves the double bond homolytically, giving a diazole
ring that further aromatizes in the presence of molecular oxygen,
yielding 2-alkyl benzazoles. It is reported that molecular oxygen
is necessary for both generation of OH• radical
and inhibition of the electron–hole recombination process occurring
on the surface of Bi2WO6.31 In our case, this feature is also observed when the reaction
is carried out under inert atmosphere by continuously bubbling N2 during the benzazole synthesis, implying that cyclization
and subsequent aromatization do not occur in the absence of molecular
oxygen. Generation of more Brønsted sites at the expense of decrease
in the Lewis sites does not hamper the photocatalytic activity of
CBTH even after five successive cycles as the first step of Schiff’s
base formation is manifested by the presence of strong Brønsted
acidic sites, resulting in almost similar yields of benzazoles (Figure 9b).

reaction pathway for the synthesis of
2-alkyl benzimidazoles with fresh catalyst and (b) Brønsted acid
initiated reaction pathway for the synthesis of 2-alkyl benzimidazoles

Comparative Account
To highlight the potentiality of
CBTH, a comparative account of semiconducting nanocomposites is tabulated
that are employed toward the synthesis of benzimidazoles and benzothiazoles
(Table 3). Inspection
of this table suggests that the majority of the catalysts exhibit
excellent catalytic activity toward the benzazole synthesis; however,
in some cases, harsh conditions are required to achieve better conversion.
For example, TiO2-based catalyst involves either a UV lamp
(entries 4–8) or heating at elevated temperatures (entries
2, 4, 5, and 10) with a comparatively large amount of the catalyst.
Reusability is another parameter that has been considered where lower
yields are obtained after certain cycles, implying that the number
of active sites on the catalyst surface is reduced because of synthetic
conditions used for benzazoles as observed for Fe3O4@SiO2/collagen catalyst (entry 1).39 Interestingly, this is the first report of the Bi2WO6 photocatalyst that has been used for light-induced
organic synthesis involving a low light energy source. Also, CBTH
exhibits an excellent recycling capability up to five cycles with
constant yield. These facets certainly can be ascribed to the excellent
photocatalytic activity of CBTH owing to the formation of monolayer-like
morphology that accounts for better absorption of light and brings
about conversion in an efficient manner.

Conclusions
In
the present work, we have demonstrated that the morphology of
Bi2WO6 indeed influences its beneficial photocatalytic
activity. For example, thin nanosheets of CBTH possess better efficiency
toward the photochemical synthesis of benzazoles when compared to
thick nanoplates of the uncoated Bi2WO6. Such
an improved activity can be attributed to increased acidity because
of the formation of distinct Lewis and Brønsted sites as well
as structural modifications that have occurred on the surface of CBTH.
Moreover, generation of oxygen vacancies within [Bi2O2]2+ sheets has significantly contributed toward
improved photocatalytic activity through increased Brønsted acidity
as a consequence of enhanced oxygen content through the formation
of Bi–O linkage. The acidic sites of CBTH favor the formation
of Schiff’s base while photocyclization via the radical process
is manifested by the WO6 octahedron of the perovskite-like
structure of Bi2WO6. Thus, it can be argued
that the CBTH catalyst efficiently harvests visible light because
of the nanosheets of the photocatalyst which is responsible for better
yields of benzazoles in a sustainable manner. Compared to other photocatalysts,
CBTH exhibits superior catalytic activity toward the synthesis of
benzazoles under eco-friendly conditions with excellent yields.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
All analytical reagent-grade chemicals were
used as received without any further purification or treatment. Bismuth
nitrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and
sodium tungstate (Na2WO4·2H2O; Loba Chemie, UK), nitric acid (Qualigens), aldehydes, CTAB, o-aminothiophenol, and o-phenylenediamine
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Precoated aluminum thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) plates (silica gel 60 F254) and silica gel for column chromatography
(mesh 60–120) were purchased from Merck, India.

Synthesis of
BTH
Bi2WO6 nanoparticles
were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis,
0.60 g of Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved
in 5 mL of deionized water and stirred for 15 min. In another flask,
1.94 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was
dissolved in 5 mL of (4 M) nitric acid, and it was then added dropwise
to the above solution under vigorous stirring so as to obtain a white
precipitate. This white precipitate was stirred for 1 h, and then
the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7 using 1:1 NH3.
The precipitate was then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave, and it was then heated in an oven at 180 °C for 14
h. The oven is cooled naturally and allowed to attain room temperature.
Pale yellow-colored residue thus obtained was filtered, washed with
deionized water, and then dried at 80 °C for 6 h.

Synthesis of
CBTH
In a typical preparation, 0.60 g
of Na2WO4·2H2O and 0.02 g of
CTAB were added in 50 mL of deionized water, and 1.94 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O was added in 5 mL of (4
M) HNO3 separately. These solutions were mixed, stirred
for 1 h, and then the pH was adjusted to 7 with 1:1 NH3. The whole mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave, and it was then heated in an oven at 180 °C for 14
h. Finally, the off-white product was filtered, washed with ethanol
to remove excess of surfactant, and then dried at 80 °C for 6
h.

Characterization
The X-ray powder diffraction data was
collected on Shimadzu Lab-X 6100 series using Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm). The powdered samples were placed on a silicon
zero-background sample holder, and the X-ray diffraction patterns
were recorded. The catalysts were subjected to FESEM analysis using
an FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument. The powdered catalyst was placed
on a carbon tape, coated with Pt, and then used for the analysis.
HRTEM images were acquired from an FEI Tecnai G2, F30, 300 kV instrument.
HRTEM images were taken by placing a drop of the nanoparticles dispersed
in methanol onto a carbon-film-supported copper grid. NH3-TPD was performed on a Micromeritics Chemisorb 2720 instrument.
The catalyst (0.05 g) was taken in a U-shaped quartz tube. Earlier,
the catalyst was pretreated in He (25 cm3/min) at 200 °C
for 2 h, and the mixture of NH3 in He (30%) was passed
(25 cm3/min) at 50 °C for 1 h. TPD measurements were
carried out in the temperature range of 50–700 °C with
a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The concentration of NH3 was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector. Py-IR spectra
were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR 8000 attached with DRIFT assembly.
The sample was placed in the DRIFT cell and heated to 400 °C
under the flow of inert gas (N2) for 1 h. It was cooled
to 100 °C, and pyridine was adsorbed on the sample. Physisorbed
pyridine was removed by flushing the cell with N2 for 60
min at 100 °C, and the spectra were recorded after maintaining
the temperature for 60 min. Raman spectra were obtained on a Horiba
JY LabRAM HR 800 micro-Raman spectrometer operating at 17 mW and an
excitation wavelength of 632.8 nm. The XPS analysis was carried out
on a PHI 5000 Versa probe II instrument (Physical electronics, ULVAC
PHI) system equipped with Al Kα (λ = 1486.6 eV) and deconvoluted
using XPSPEAK 4.1 software. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 solvents using a
500 MHz spectrometer (AVANCE 500, Bruker, Bremen, Germany). The 1H and 13C spectra were recorded at radiofrequencies
of 500 and 400 MHz and 125 and 100 MHz, respectively.

General Procedure
for the Photochemical Synthesis of 2-Alkyl
Benzothiazoles
To a solution of aldehyde (1 mmol) in acetonitrile
(5 mL), 15 mg of the photocatalyst was added and stirred for 15 min.
After addition of o-aminothiophenol (1 mmol; dissolved
in 10 mL of acetonitrile), the reaction mixture was transferred to
a 50 mL double-walled quartz photoreactor (Figure S4). The reaction mixture was then exposed to visible light
using a 35 W tungsten lamp, and the temperature of the reaction was
maintained by water circulation. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by TLC. On completion of the reaction, the catalyst was
separated by centrifugation and the filtrate was concentrated under
vacuum. The product was purified by a filtration column on silica
gel (60–120 mesh) using hexane/ethyl acetate (85:15) to yield
pure compounds. The products were characterized using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S5–S20).

General Procedure for the Photochemical Synthesis
of 2-Alkyl
Benzimidazoles
A procedure similar to that for the photochemical
synthesis of 2-alkyl benzothiazoles was adopted for the synthesis
of 2-alkyl benzimidazoles using o-phenylenediamine
(1 mmol; dissolved in 10 mL of acetonitrile) instead of o-aminothiophenol. The product was purified by a filtration column
on silica gel (60–120 mesh) using hexane/ethyl acetate (90:10)
to yield pure products. These pure products were further characterized
using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S21–S36).

Longevity Studies
Recycling experiments were carried
out with the CBTH-catalyzed photochemical synthesis of 2-phenyl benzimidazoles.
After the completion of the reaction, the filtrate was separated from
the catalyst by simple decantation, and the catalyst was washed successively
with acetonitrile, ethanol, and acetone so as to remove adsorbed moieties.
It was then used for the subsequent cycle by adding an appropriate
amount of reactants and illuminated with a tungsten lamp for the same
amount of time. This procedure was repeated for five cycles, and the
recovered catalyst was subjected for further analysis.
