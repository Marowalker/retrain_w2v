Simple
and readily available iron(III) triflate turned out to be
a cheap, environmentally benign, and efficient catalyst for the direct
etherification of alcohols. The use of ammonium chloride as an additive
(5 mol %, 1 equiv relative to catalyst) suppressed the side reactions
completely and ensured the selective ether formation even on challenging
substrates containing electron-donating substituents. This method
allows the selective synthesis of symmetrical ethers from benzylic
secondary alcohols and unsymmetrical ethers directly from secondary
and primary alcohols. Moreover, transetherification of symmetrical
ethers using primary alcohols is attained. The reaction progress of
symmetrical ether and unsymmetrical ether formation followed zero-order
and first-order kinetics, respectively. Electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) measurements of the reaction mixture and simple iron(III) triflate
clearly indicated that oxidation state of the metal center remains
same throughout the catalysis. Mechanistic studies confirmed that
the unsymmetrical ether formation occurs via the in situ formed symmetrical
ethers.

==== Body
Introduction
Ethers have widespread
applications as solvents, plasticizers,
disinfectants, herbicides, drug intermediates, fragrances, and precursors
for polymers.1 Etherification is an important
transformation in organic synthesis, which traditionally employs sodium
alkoxide and alkyl halides as originally devised by Williamson (Scheme 1a).2 Although this method is particularly useful for the preparation
of unsymmetrical ethers, it suffers from drawbacks such as generation
of stoichiometric amount of inorganic waste and requirement of alkyl
halides, which are derived from alcohols, making the ether synthesis
an ultimate multistep process.3 Transition-metal-catalyzed
methods are developed for the synthesis of ethers from diverse functional
groups to circumvent these shortcomings. For example, aryl-substituted
ethers are derived from aryl halides and alcohols using Pd- and Cu-catalyzed
Ullmann-type synthesis.4 Mitsunobu-type
etherification reactions,5 reductive deoxygenation
of esters,6 oxidation–reduction
condensation of alcohols via alkoxydiphenylphosphines,7 hydroetherification of alkenes using alcohols,8 and oxidative etherification of aryl C–H
bonds are reported.9 However, these methods
have limited scope and also suffer from poor atom economy.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Ethers: Catalytic vs Conventional Methods
Direct coupling of alcohols to ether is attractive as
it offers
the atom economical and environmentally benign method with eliminated
water as the only byproduct (Scheme 1b).10 However, due to poor
ability of the hydroxyl functionality as a leaving group, hydroxide
activation is challenging, particularly for the nucleophilic substitution,
which is recognized as an important topic in green chemistry.11 Thus, dehydration of alcohols developed for
the ether synthesis became an important transformation in organic
synthesis with widespread use.12 Ethers
are produced in large scale using heterogeneous acid or strong Brønsted
acid catalysts.13 Efficient synthesis of
unsymmetrical ethers directly from two different alcohols is also
achieved using transition-metal catalysts (Scheme 1b).14 Recently,
a radical pathway for the dehydrative O-alkylation reaction between
alcohols has been reported, albeit at elevated temperature.15 Iron is an earth abundant, less toxic, and environmentally
benign metal that can potentially provide economical advantage and
poised to emulate the catalytic activities of noble metals.16 Iron-catalyzed dehydrative etherification is
scarcely investigated in the literature with limited substrate scopes.17 Thus, development of a simple, readily available
iron catalyst that can catalyze the selective formation of both symmetrical
and unsymmetrical ethers directly from alcohols is a desired goal.

Herein, we report a highly selective dehydrative formation of symmetrical
and unsymmetrical ethers of two different alcohols. This catalytic
method can tolerate wide range of functional groups by generating
water as a sole byproduct under mild conditions. These reactions proceed
via activation of secondary benzylic alcohols to form symmetrical
ethers and subsequently unsymmetrical ethers formed in the presence
of primary alcohols.

Results and Discussion
At the outset
of our studies, we focused our attention to optimize
the reaction conditions for the synthesis of symmetrical ethers. Thus,
1-phenylethanol was reacted with iron(III) salts in different solvents.
When FeCl3·6H2O (5 mol %) was reacted with
1-phenylethanol in dichloromethane (DCM) at 0 °C, oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl)dibenzene
(1a) formed in 65% yield together with an alkene side
product 2 in 15% yield (entry 1, Table 1). Further, Fe(NO3)3 was screened under similar reaction conditions, which did not provide
the desired product (entry 2, Table 1).17f Upon employing Fe(OTf)3 as a catalyst, the desired ether product was obtained in
only 10%, whereas the formation of alkene was observed in 70% yield
(entry 3, Table 1).
Perhaps, the enhanced acidity in the reaction medium due to the use
of iron(III) triflate resulted in promoting the formation of alkene
side product, which we envisaged to suppress by the use of ammonium
salts as an additive. Direct catalytic etherification of 1-phenylethanol
was performed with Fe(OTf)3 (5 mol %) and NH4Cl (5 mol %, 1 equiv relative to catalyst) to obtain the desired
oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl)dibenzene (1a) in 81% yield (entry
4, Table 1). Gratifyingly,
no formation of the alkene side product was observed. Further increase
of NH4Cl load to 20 mol % made almost no impact on catalysis
(entry 5, Table 1).
Notably, the direct etherification of alcohols catalyzed by iron(III)
triflate is very sensitive to the solvent medium. When other polar
solvents (such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and acetone,
entries 6–8, Table 1) and nonpolar solvents like toluene (entry 9, Table 1) were used, no reaction occurred.
Further, control experiments in dichloromethane without catalyst or
only with NH4Cl provided no product, clearly indicating
that direct ether formation from alcohols is essentially a catalytic
process (entries 10 and 11, Table 1). Remarkably, the reaction conditions are very simple
and require no inert atmosphere.

a Reaction
conditions: 1-phenylethanol
(0.5 mmol), solvent (2 mL), Fe(OTf)3 (0.025 mmol, 5 mol
%), and NH4Cl (0.025 mmol, 5 mol %) were stirred at 0 °C
to room temperature (rt) for 0.5 h in open air.

b Isolated yield.

Using the optimized conditions, an assortment of 1-substituted
secondary benzyl alcohols was subjected to iron(III) triflate-catalyzed
direct etherification reactions. 1-Phenylpropanol provided the corresponding
product in 67% yield (entry 2, Table 2). However, alcohols having electron-donating substituents
on the aryl ring displayed enhanced reactivity and the corresponding
products 1c–f were isolated in very
good yields (87–93%, entries 3–6, Table 2). Although all of these reactions completed
in 30 min, the secondary benzyl alcohols having electron-withdrawing
fluorine substituent required prolonged reaction time (3 h) to provide
the product 1g in 81% yield (entry 7, Table 2). The catalyst was also effective
in promoting the reaction of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol, and the
corresponding ether 1h was obtained in 65% yield (entry
8, Table 2). When the
sterically more demanding diphenylmethanol and bromo diphenylmethanol
were subjected to catalysis, the corresponding symmetrical ethers 1i and 1j were isolated in 82 and 91% yields,
respectively (entries 9 and 10, Table 2). Representatively, a single-crystal X-ray structure
of diphenylmethyl ether 1i was solved,18 which clearly established ether formation from the dehydrative
coupling of diphenylmethanol.

Symmetrical Etherification

a Reaction conditions: 1-phenylethanol
derivatives (0.5 mmol), DCM (2 mL), Fe(OTf)3 (0.025 mmol,
5 mol %), and NH4Cl (0.025 mmol, 5 mol %) were stirred
at 0 °C to rt in open air.

b Isolated yield.

Next,
we investigated the formation of unsymmetrical ethers using
two different alcohols (Table 3). When 1-phenylethanol was reacted with 1-propanol in the
presence of iron(III) triflate (5 mol %), ammonium chloride (5 mol
%) at 0 °C to room temperature incomplete reaction was observed
and the reaction mixture contains both symmetrical and unsymmetrical
ether products. Thus, upon carrying out the similar experiment of
direct catalytic etherification at 45 °C, the unsymmetrical ether 3a was obtained in 88% yield after 12 h. Further to verify
the efficiency of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, catalytic reaction was performed under optimized condition, which
resulted in no formation of unsymmetrical ether 3a.17f Secondary alcohols like 1-substituted benzyl
alcohols containing electron-donating substituents on the aryl ring
were reacted with linear primary alcohols. All of these reactions
completed within 2–12 h, and the unsymmetrical ethers 3a–g were isolated in good yields. The
unsymmetrical ether formation was sensitive to the steric hindrance
on the secondary alcohols. Thus, reaction of 1-mesitylethanol with
1-pentanol provided the corresponding unsymmetrical ether 3h in 45% yield. Notably, when 1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol was reacted
with methanol, the reaction completed in 10 h to provide the unsymmetrical
ether 3i in 91% yield. Further, primary benzyl alcohols
were reacted with secondary benzyl alcohols; reaction of 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol with benzyl alcohol and 4-methyl benzyl
alcohol provided the corresponding unsymmetrical ethers 3j and 3k in excellent yields. However, upon employing
the primary benzyl alcohols containing electron-withdrawing groups,
reactions occurred for more than 24 h (3l–n) and the 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol provided the product 3n only in 45% yield. Gratifyingly, reaction of 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol with hept-2-yn-1-ol delivered the ether
product in excellent yield 3p of 95%, without generating
any side product under this mild experimental condition. Reaction
of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol with tetrahydrofurfural provided only
40% product 3q. Interestingly, tertiary alcohol also
underwent unsymmetrical etherification with nonbenzylic aliphatic
primary alcohol. Reaction of tert-butanol and 3-phenylpropanol
provided 40% 3r upon heating at 70 °C.

Etherification of Two Different Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: secondary alcohol
(0.5 mmol), primary alcohol (0.5 mmol), Fe(OTf)3 (0.025
mmol, 5 mol %), and NH4Cl (0.025 mmol, 5 mol %) in DCM

b Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.025 mmol, 5 mol %) was used as catalyst.

c Reaction was carried out at 70 °C.
Reported yields correspond to isolated product after column chromatographic
purification.

Next, we investigated
the formation of unsymmetrical ethers using
symmetrical ethers and alcohols (Table 4). As the unsymmetrical ethers are more thermodynamically
stable than the symmetrical ethers, the reverse formation of symmetrical
ethers does not occur. All of these transetherification reactions
completed within 1–12 h, and the unsymmetrical ethers 3b and 4a–f were isolated
in good yields. Gratifyingly, reactions tolerate alkene and alkyne
functionalities. (Oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene (1a) was reacted with 1-pentanol, but-3-en-1-ol, hex-3-yn-1-ol, and
(2-fluorophenyl)methanol in the presence of iron(III) triflate (5
mol %) and ammonium chloride (5 mol %) at room temperature, which
provided the corresponding unsymmetrical ethers 3b, 4a–c, respectively, in very good yields.
Further, the unsymmetrical ethers 4d–f were also obtained from transetherification of (oxybis(methanetriyl))tetrabenzene
(1i) with but-3-en-1-ol, 2-ethylbutan-1-ol, and 3-methoxybutan-1-ol,
respectively.

Table 4 Iron(III)-Catalyzed Transetherification
of Symmetrical Ethers with Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: symmetrical
ether (0.5 mmol), primary alcohol (1 mmol), DCM (2 mL), Fe(OTf)3 (0.025 mmol, 5 mol %), and NH4Cl (0.025 mmol,
5 mol %) were stirred at rt in open air.

The mechanistic insights for the iron(III)-catalyzed
direct etherification
of alcohols are deciphered by performing elementary reactions and
in situ analysis of the reaction progress. 1-(p-Tolyl)ethanol
was reacted with 1-pentanol for 2 h at three different temperatures;
at 0 °C, no formation of unsymmetrical ether 3f was
observed, whereas reactions performed at room temperature and 35 °C
provided 3f in 75 and 80% yields (Scheme 2a). Moreover, the reaction progress of the
symmetrical and unsymmetrical etherification processes was monitored
using the gas chromatography (GC) to study the kinetics. The reaction
progress for self-etherification of 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol
catalyzed by Fe(OTf)3/NH4Cl followed a linear
line, indicating a zero-order kinetics (Figure 1a). When the reaction progress for cross-etherification
of 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol with 1-pentanol was monitored
by GC (which followed first-order kinetics), the formation and disappearance
of the symmetrical ether (1c) intermediate, concomitantly
transforming to the ultimate unsymmetrical ether product 3f, was observed in the reaction mixture (Figure 1b). These observations confirm that the formation
of unsymmetrical ether goes via in situ formed symmetrical ether and
subsequent nucleophilic attack by a primary alcohol. To study the
chemoselectivity and electronic influence of primary alcohols on the
unsymmetrical ether formation, an equimolar mixture of 4-methylbenzyl
alcohol and 4-cyanobenzyl alcohol was reacted with 1-(p-tolyl)ethanol to afford 3k and 3o in a
ratio of 1.15:1, respectively. This observation indicates that the
electron-rich benzylic alcohol is slightly more reactive than the
electron-deficient primary alcohols (Scheme 2b). To confirm the role of ammonium chloride,
further experiment with tetraethyl ammonium chloride under similar
reaction condition was performed and no conversion of 1-phenylethanol
was noted, which ruled out the possible involvement of Cl– counter anion in catalytic cycle. Therefore, active participation
of NH4+ ion in the catalytic cycle is anticipated
(Scheme 2c). Moreover,
to investigate the reversibility from symmetrical ether to alcohol,
reaction was performed with two different symmetrical ethers under
similar reaction condition. Reaction of (oxybis(ethane-1,1-diyl))dibenzene
(1a) with (oxybis(methanetriyl))tetrabenzene (1i) in the presence of iron(III) triflate (5 mol %) and ammonium chloride
(5 mol %) at room temperature provided the corresponding alkene 5 in 71% yield (Scheme 2d). However, in this case, reaction did not stop at the formation
of unsymmetrical ether and proceeded to the formation of corresponding
alkene 5. These studies indicate reversibility between
intermediates I and II during the progress
of the reaction. Further, 1-phenylethanol was reacted with 1-pentanol
in the presence of Fe(OTf)3 (5 mol %), ammonium chloride
(5 mol %), and molecular sieves (3 Å) at 45 °C for 12 h,
which provided 75% conversion of 1-phenylethanol and 55% unsymmetrical
ether (Scheme 2e).

and (b) unsymmetrical ether formation.

recorded at room temperature in DCM solution under microwave frequency
(9.85 GHz).

Scheme 2 Mechanistic Studies
for the Catalytic Etherification and Transetherification
Electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) measurements were carried
out at room temperature (298 K) in dichloromethane to investigate
the change in oxidation state of iron(III) triflate during the course
of reaction. The EPR measurements of the reaction mixture (3a, Table 3) were carried
out at room temperature for the reaction of 1-phenylethanol and 1-propanol.
The reaction mixture was monitored from 0 to 40 min at regular interval
to observe the catalytically active species for the etherification
of alcohol (Figure S74). The corresponding g value (g = 2.016) of the reaction mixture
is almost similar to that of iron(III) triflate in dichloromethane
(g = 2.013), which clearly indicates that the oxidation
state of the metal center remains same during catalysis. Moreover,
EPR graph of the reaction mixture shows fine structure (Figure 2), which indicates spin value S = 5/2 (d5, high spin) attributing to iron(III)
species. However, the width between corresponding extreme slopes of
reaction mixture (at 40 min) and iron(III) triflate EPR signals are
45G and 224G, respectively. This difference between line width of
EPR signals is perhaps due to change in the chemical environment around
the metal center during the reaction progress.

On the basis
of these experimental observations, the mechanism
of the iron(III)-catalyzed dehydrative etherification of alcohols
was proposed as described in Scheme 3. The reaction of iron(III) catalyst with secondary
benzylic alcohols leads to the formation of zwitterionic intermediate I. Upon reaction with another molecule of secondary alcohol
via dehydration (self-condensation), intermediate I is
transformed to II. This reaction involves the C–O
bond cleavage and in situ formation of benzylic carbocation. The stability
of benzylic carbocation is well documented in the literature and has
been the subject of theoretical and experimental studies.17g At low temperature, the symmetrical ether dissociates
from the intermediate II to regenerate the catalyst.
In the presence of primary alcohols in the reaction mixture, a second
intermolecular nucleophilic attack by primary alcohol occurs at slightly
elevated temperature (45 °C), leading to the formation of unsymmetrical
ether product and intermediate I. The selective formation
of unsymmetrical ether product from the symmetrical ether is due to
the reversible formation of intermediate II from the
symmetrical ethers and higher nucleophilicity of primary alcohols
over the secondary alcohols.

Catalytic Etherification of Alcohols
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient
method for the selective
synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical benzylic ethers from different
alcohols using Fe(OTf)3 and ammonium chloride. The use
of ammonium chloride as an additive completely suppressed the side
reactions and ensured the selective formation of ethers. As these
reactions proceeded under mild experimental conditions and in open
air, a variety of functional groups are well tolerated. An assortment
of symmetrical and unsymmetrical ether derivatives was synthesized
by dehydration of benzylic alcohols. Remarkably, by transetherification,
unsymmetrical ethers were also synthesized using symmetrical ethers
and alcohols in very good yields. Mechanistic studies clearly indicated
that oxidation state of the catalyst remains same throughout the catalysis
and that the formation of unsymmetrical ethers occurs from the in
situ formed symmetrical ethers. The use of ligand-free, simple, cheap,
and readily available iron(III) triflate as a catalyst makes this
protocol highly attractive and environmentally benign.

Experimental
Section
General Experimental Procedure
All catalytic reactions
were performed under open atmosphere. Iron catalyst was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Dry solvents were prepared according to standard
procedures. 1H and 13C spectra were recorded
at 400 MHz (1H: 400 MHz, 13C: 100.6 MHz) and
700 MHz (1H: 700 MHz, 13C: 176 MHz) NMR. 1H and 13C {1H} NMR chemical shifts were
reported in ppm downfield from tetramethyl silane. Multiplicity is
abbreviated as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets;
t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplate. IR spectra were recorded on
an Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Mass spectra were recorded
on a micrOTOF-Q II spectrometer. EPR spectra were recorded on a QCW–EPR
bridge X band spectrometer.

GC Method
Gas chromatography analyses
were performed
using a gas chromatograph equipped with a SH-Rtx-1 capillary column
(30 m × 250 μm). The instrument was set to an injection
volume of 1 μL, an inlet split ratio of 100:1, and inlet and
detector temperatures of 250 and 280 °C, respectively. Ultrahigh
purity-grade nitrogen was used as carrier gas with a flow rate of
120.9 mL/min. The temperature program used for all of the analyses
is as follows: 50 °C, 1 min; 12 °C/min to 250 °C, 10
min. Response factor for all of the necessary compounds with respect
to standard n-dodecane was calculated from the average
of three independent GC runs.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Symmetrical Ether
Benzyl alcohol (0.5 mmol),
ammonium chloride (1.3 mg, 0.025 mmol),
and Fe(OTf)3 (12.6 mg, 5 mol %) in dichloromethane (2 mL)
were charged in a round-bottom flask with a stirrer bar under open
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C and allowed
to warm at room temperature. After completion of the reaction (monitored
by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and GC), analytically pure product
was isolated by column chromatography on silica gel (100–200
mesh, petroleum ether/EtOAc = 100:0–10:1).

General Procedure for Synthesis
of Unsymmetrical Ether
Using Two Different Alcohols
Benzyl
alcohol (0.5 mmol),
aliphatic alcohol (0.5 mmol), ammonium chloride (1.3 mg, 0.025 mmol),
and Fe(OTf)3 (12.6 mg, 5 mol %) in dichloromethane (2 mL)
were charged in a sealed tube with a stirrer bar under open atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 45 °C for specified time.
After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC and GC), analytically
pure product was isolated by a column chromatography on silica gel
(100–200 mesh, petroleum ether/EtOAc = 100:0–10:1).

Using Ether and Alcohol
Symmetrical ether (0.5 mmol),
primary alcohol (1.0 mmol), ammonium chloride (1.3 mg, 0.025 mmol),
and Fe(OTf)3 (12.6 mg, 5 mol %) in dichloromethane (2 mL)
were charged in a 20 mL vial with a stirrer bar under open atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for specified
time. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC and GC),
analytically pure product was isolated by column chromatography on
silica gel (100–200 mesh, petroleum ether/EtOAc = 100:0–10:1).
