Applicability of Hammett parameters
(σm and σp) was tested in
extended π-systems in gas phase. Three different model graphene
systems, viz. 5,5-graphene (GR), 3-B-5,5-graphene (3BGR), and 3-N-5,5-graphene (3NGR), were designed
as extended π-systems, and interactions of various nitrobenzene
derivatives (mainly m- and p-substituted
together with some multiple substitutions) on such platforms were
monitored using density functional theory (M06/cc-pVDZ, M06/cc-pVTZ,
M06/sp-aug-cc-pVTZ) and Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation
(MP2/cc-pV-DZ) theory. Offset face to face (OSFF) stackings were found
to be the favored orientations, and reasonable correlations were found
between binding energies (ΔEB) and
the ∑|σm| values of the substituted
nitrobenzenes. It was proposed previously that |σm| contains information about the substituents’
polarizability and controls electrostatic and dispersion interactions.
The combination of ∑|σm|
and molar refractivity (as ∑Mr)
or change in polarizability (Δα: with respect to benzene)
of nitrobenzene derivatives generated statistically significant correlation
with respect to ΔEB, thereby supporting
the hypothesis related to the validity of |σm| correlations. The |σp| parameters also maintain similar correlations for the various p-substituted nitrobenzene derivatives together with several
multiply-substituted nitrobenzene derivatives. The correlation properties
in such cases are similar to the |σm| cases, and the energy partition analysis for both the situations
reveled importance of electrostatic and dispersion contributions in
such interactions. The applicability of Hammett parameters was observed
previously on the restricted parallel face to face orientation of
benzene···substituted benzene systems, and the present
results show that such an idea could be used to predict ΔEB values in OSFF orientations, if the scaffolds
are designed in such a way that substituted benzene systems cannot
escape their π-clouds.

1 Introduction
Noncovalent
interactions of aromatics are important in a wide range
of chemical and biological processes.1−7 These include enzyme–substrate recognition,4,8 protein structure and function,9−11 DNA/RNA base stacking12 and intercalation,13,14 organic reaction development,15 and organic
materials.16−19 Arene–arene interactions play a key role in enzyme–substrate
reactions. A significant number of experimental4,20−28 and theoretical investigations29−36 are available in this connection explaining the role of such interactions.
High-level theoretical investigation demonstrated that dispersion
forces primarily dominate the observed binding,30−39 although the initial studies of Hunter and Sanders40 in this direction indicated the major force of interactions
to be electrostatic in origin.

Computational study of interactions
between benzene and monosubstituted
benzenes in parallel face to face (PFF) orientation showed that there
exists a correlation of binding energies (ΔEB) with Hammett σm values
of monosubstituted aromatics.41 The results
were interpreted as support to the proposed domination of the dispersion
and electrostatic interactions in such cases. Still the Hammett constants
σm or ∑σm for multisubstituted aromatics were not found to
be sufficient to predict the arene–arene binding energies.
More recently, Watt et al.42 have shown
a good correlation between the ΔEB of arene–arene complexes and the ∑|σm| values of the substituted arenes. These studies
were carried out under constrained geometric conditions to keep the
interacting molecules in strict PFF orientations. Obviously, such
an orientation was chosen to maximize π–π (origin
of most of the dispersive forces) and electrostatic interactions.
The authors also found the contribution of both electrostatic and
dispersion energies as important guiding factors to impose good correlation
with the ∑|σm| parameters.
The importance of ∑|σm| parameters
was also demonstrated by Cormier and Lewis for the interactions of
Li+ and Na+ with cyclopentadienyl anions.43

No reasonable explanation exists as to
why Hammett constant (σm) and related
parameters like ∑σm, and
∑|σm| should have any correlation
with ΔEB. The origin of the idea
of using Hammett constants to predict
arene–arene attraction was explored in numerous experimental
studies.8−10,12 The main assumption
here is that such an attraction is largely electrostatic in nature
(Hunter and Sanders),40 and a parameter
that describes the electronic effects of substituents on benzoic acid
acidity,44 the Hammett constant, should
work to model such electronic/electrostatic arene–arene interactions.
Several investigations in recent times have, however, found that this
assumption is not correct. Watt and co-workers42 carried out detailed analysis in this respect and proposed
that the ∑|σm| values contain
information that regular Hammett paramers σm and ∑σm are lacking.
They concluded that it is probably the dispersion contribution to
the overall binding. The hypothesis did originate from the results
of multiple regression analysis correlating ΔEB with ∑σm and
∑Mr (Mr: refractivity of molecules) parameters. The correlation was very
promising, and because Mr implicitly involves
polarizability of molecules, the hypothesis of the involvement of
dispersion effect in ∑|σm| was qualitatively substantiated. A recent review by Lewis and co-workers45 summarized the different ideas related to this
problem, but their explanations are not yet conclusive and the authors
still supported their earlier conclusion.42

The Hammett constant σp had
also
been found to correlate with ΔEB in arene–arene interactions for multiply-substituted benzene
systems. Wheeler and Houk41 suggested that
the correlation of σp with ΔEB in such cases relates to the polarization
of the π-system of the substituted ring. Subsequent investigations
of Watt et al.42 also suggested that ∑σp and ∑Mr (replaced
further by lipophilicity parameter ∑π) for substituted
benzenes in PFF orientations of the arene–arene systems show
similar correlation to ΔEB as discussed
for the σm parameter cases, although
the correlations were not as good.

There are two other orientations
in arene–arene interactions,
viz. offset face to face (OSFF) and edge to face (ETF). The interacting
moieties in OSFF orientations were more stable than the rest of the
geometric orientations.36 In the case of
benzene–benzene dimers, OSFF and ETF orientations were almost
equally stable.29−35 There could be, of course, an infinite number of OSFF and ETF arene–arene
dimer orientations. The OSFF orientations can vary by how offset the
two arenes are with respect to each other (in an infinite number of
directions), and the ETF arene–arene dimer orientations can
vary in the angle between the two aromatics and whether the vertical
aromatic has an edge, a C atom, or some intermediate orientation,
interacting with the horizontal aromatic. So, there is no unique orientation
for the most stable benzene···substituted benzene interactions.
The interacting systems (OSFF) were not considered in most of the
previous studies of Hammett correlations with ΔEB, as face to face π–π interactions
would be lost and Hammett constant correlation might not be that important.
There have been, of course, several arene–substituted arene
interaction studies in recent times to show the importance of OSFF
orientation of the interacting systems in explaining structural aspects
of different π–π stackings.46,47 Now, if one changes the scaffold to a larger conjugated π-system
like graphene (instead of benzene), the substituted benzene moieties
in parallel orientations (either in PFF or OSFF) cannot escape π–π
stacking. Thus, the hypotheses of the correlations of Hammett constants
with ΔEB could be valid here, regardless
of the nature of the parallel orientations of the substituted benzenes
against the graphene scaffold. Moreover, it will also be interesting
to monitor the effect of doping on the graphene sheet for such interactions.
Controlled doping of the single-walled carbon nanotubes by boron atoms
does not have marked change in the π-character44 of the system and it is expected to be the same for the
graphene sheet also. In the present situation, it will be interesting
to see if such doping has any effect on the Hammett correlations as
discussed above.

The work presented here addresses the idea
of Hammett constants’
(σm, σp, and related parameters) correlation with the ΔEB of various nitrobenzene derivatives on model
graphene scaffolds. The nitrobenzene derivatives were chosen because
of the availability of the experimental Gibbs free energy of binding
of a few of such compounds with the graphene systems in OSFF orientation
(discussed in detail in Section 2). These experimental values are useful to calibrate
the computed binding energy data. The model graphene system was designed
from 5,5-graphene. Singly B- and N-doped graphenes were also designed
from this model for further use as scaffolds with graphene-like π-orbital
character. The B- and N-doped graphene materials are quite well known,48−50 and previous theoretical studies also showed that they preserve
the properties of the pristine graphene materials.50 The singly doped model B- and N-graphenes in the present
studies are thus expected to influence the nature of interactions
with nitroaromatics (due to the influence of B and N atoms) without
disturbing the π-character of the whole system with respect
to pristine graphene. The preservation of π–π stacking
character was observed in case of interactions between N-doped graphene
systems.51,52 The size of the graphene systems was chosen
such that the nitrobenzene derivatives retain OSFF orientations during
interactions avoiding edge effect. It would be shown that dispersion
forces together with electrostatic interactions play important roles
in such binding, as was suggested in arene–arene interactions.
Although the Hammett σ-parameters of nitrobenzene derivatives
show good correlations in terms of ∑|σx| (x: m or p) during their interactions with 5,5-graphene, two variable equations
with a combination involving ∑σx (x: m or p) and ∑Mr are found to be more
convincing. Moreover, because the parameter Mr involves polarizability, the computed shift of polarizabilities
(Δα) of nitrobenzene derivatives (with respect to benzene)
in combination with ∑σx (x: m or p) parameter also
shows convincing correlation in this respect. Although doped 5,5-graphenes
show similar interactions to nitrobenzene derivatives, the correlations
with Hammett parameters are not as good as the 5,5-graphene cases.
Probably, change of electrostatic interactions with respect to pristine
graphene system plays a role here. Energy decomposition analysis has
been carried out to account for the role of electrostatic and dispersion
interactions in such complexes. The results will also show their influence
in correlating the binding energies to Hammett σ-parameters.

2 Methods of Computation
The model 5,5-graphene (GR) system is shown in Figure 1. The system is designed
in such a way that it has a mirror plane with respect to the x-axis. Thus, full optimization of the system does not disturb
the overall symmetry (D2h) of this model graphene unit. The edges of the graphene unit are
terminated with H-atoms to avoid edge effect during interactions with
the chosen nitrobenzene systems. The B- and N-doped model systems
were designed by substituting C3 of the central ring (C2v-symmetry), as shown in Figure 1, and we designate
them as 3-B-5,5-graphene (3BGR) and 3-N-5,5-graphene
(3NGR), respectively. The substituted nitrobenzene dimers
(X–C6H4–NO2) were chosen
to have X = H, CH3, OCH3, OC2H5, Cl, Br, I, OH, CN, and NH2 substituents at m- and p-positions. Moreover, three compounds
with substituents 3-NO2-4-OH, 3,5-di-NO2-4-OH,
and 3,5-di-NO2-4-CH3 (with respect to the NO2 group of nitrobenzene) were also considered for investigating
the interaction properties. The interaction geometries between the GR and substituted nitrobenzene molecules were computed, allowing
the systems to relax fully from initial PFF orientation. A similar
approach was adopted for the interactions with 3BGR and 3NGR scaffolds. There could be more than one local minimum
in such optimizations, but we have located the desired minima through
optimizations from different starting parallel OSFF orientations.
Geometry optimizations of nitroaromatics, graphene scaffolds, and
their complexes were carried out using density functional theory (DFT)53 with M06 functional54 and cc-pVDZ basis set of atoms (cc-pVDZ-PP ECP (effective core potential)
basis set was used for iodine). The M06-2X functional54 could have been another choice here, but because both M06
and M06-2X generate similar results for such noncovalent interactions,
we have used the M06 functional only. M06-2X was used for the initial
calibrations. The minimum-energy structures in the respective cases
were confirmed through frequency calculations. These results were
used to compute the binding energy (ΔEB), enthalpy (ΔHB°),
and Gibbs free energy (ΔGB°)
of binding (at 298K) of the complexes. The calculations included counterpoise
(CP) and zero-point energy (ZPE) corrections. Calculations of thermodynamic
properties were carried out by applying the ideal gas, rigid rotator,
and harmonic oscillator approximations.55

The various colored regions on the surfaces are deep blue (highly
positive, >0.1 au), light blue (<0.1 and >0.05 au), green

geometries of GR (G), 3BGR (H), and 3NGR (I) (DFT/M06/cc-pVDZ level) are also added for more clarity
of the scaffold structures.

The computed ΔEB values
(ΔEBs) were further refined using
higher-level
cc-pVTZ and sp-aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets at the DFT/M06 level. There
were convergence problems in using aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets directly
in the energy calculations of the GR/3BGR/3NGR···nitrobenzene (and nitrobenzene
derivative) complexes (probably because of linear dependence). The
higher-angular-momentum diffuse functions (d and f) of the main atoms and the hydrogen diffuse functions
were causing such problems, and these diffuse functions were eliminated
in the final sp-aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets to achieve energy convergence.
In the case of iodine, the cc-pVTZ-PP and sp-aug-cc-pVDZ-PP ECP basis
sets were used for energy calculations. Single-point calculations
were carried out on the optimized geometries at the DFT/cc-pVDZ level
to estimate the CP corrections. The ZPE and the energies for the individual
components were obtained from the frequency analysis of the optimized
structures at the DFT/cc-pVDZ level for the computations of ΔEBs. The ΔEBs from all of these computations, and ΔHB° and ΔGB° at
the DFT/cc-pVDZ level as well, were further corrected through inclusion
of dispersion energy of interactions (ΔEdisp). The magnitude of ΔEdisp was estimated at the DFT/cc-pVTZ level (using optimized geometries
from the DFT/cc-pVDZ calculations) through inclusion of Grimme’s
empirical dispersion (GD3)56 and obtained
as the difference of interaction energies (with CP corrections) with
and without the dispersion effects. The computed ΔEdisp values were added to the estimated binding energies.
This is a valid approximation as the geometries are the same at all
of these basis set levels. We have further estimated the ΔEB (CP- and ZPE-corrected) through single-point
Møller–Plesset second-order perturbation (MP2)57 calculations (cc-pVDZ basis sets) using the
geometries and ZPE corrections from the DFT/cc-pVDZ results. The results
generated a direct estimation of ΔEdisp and used in energy partitioning analysis.

Energy partitioning
analyses were carried out to estimate the contribution
of electrostatic interactions in such complex formations. These were
computed using a hybrid variational–perturbational interaction
energy decomposition scheme.58 The SCF
interaction energy is partitioned into first-order electrostatic (Eel(10)), Heitler–London exchange (Eex(10)), and higher-order
delocalization (ΔEdelHF) energy terms. 1  The MP2 calculations
generate an estimation
of ΔEdisp, which could be designated
as EMP(2). It includes the dispersion and correlation contributions
to the Hartree–Fock components, and is calculated using the
supermolecular approach as the difference of MP2 energy corrections
of the supermolecule and the monomers (eq 2). 2  The energy terms on the right-hand
side of eq 2 represent
the difference
between the MP2 and Hartree–Fock energies of the supermolecule
(AB) and the monomers (A and B). All of the interaction energy terms
are calculated consistently in the dimer-centered basis set and are
therefore free from the basis set superposition error (BSSE) due to
the full counterpoise correction. The contribution of the multipolar
electrostatic interactions in the cation−π complexes
has been calculated using the distributed atomic multipolar expansion
of the charge distributions of monomers.59 The multipolar expansion technique is based on the numerically equivalent
spherical harmonic formulations of Stone et al.60,61 The optimized structures at the DFT/B3LYP/cc-pVDZ level were used
for such calculations. The results of such energy decomposition calculations
are not rigorous and would be valid for interpretation purposes only,
as there is an element of arbitrariness in any of such decomposition
schemes. All of the computations were carried out using Gaussian 09
code.62 The interaction energy decomposition
scheme implemented in the GAMESS code63 was used for energy partitioning analyses and computation of the
multipolar components of the total electrostatic interaction energies.64 Molecular graphics have been generated using
the GaussView05 software.65

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Comparison of the Binding
Energies of Nitroaromatics
with GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR Scaffolds
The π-orbitals of GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR (Figure 1) show that the π-network of these systems are capable of holding
the nitroaromatics through long-range π–π interactions.
The optimized structures of such stackings are available in Figures S1–S4 (Supporting Information),
and a general model of such interactions, depicting distance between
the two π-systems, is shown in Scheme 1. As expected, all of the optimized structures
show OSFF arrangements and the aromatic nitro compounds do not get
out of the GR/3BGR/3NGR platforms
due their extended π-network. The binding energies (ΔEB, ΔHB°,
and ΔGB°) were initially computed
(as discussed in Section 2) at the DFT/M06/cc-pVDZ level. The higher basis set (cc-pVTZ
and sp-aug-cc-pVTZ) and MP2/cc-pVDZ calculations were carried out
to monitor the accuracy of the ΔEB values through higher electron correlation effects. These strategies
to compute ΔEB error limits are
essential, as the primary objective is to use such results to monitor
the validity of Hammett correlation in such interactions. The binding
energy values for various interactions at the DFT/cc-pVDZ level are
shown in Tables 1 and 2 for the m- and p-substituted nitrobenzenes, respectively, together with di- and tri-substituted
nitrobenzenes. The ΔEB at higher
basis sets and at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level, for the similar cases, are
shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Distance (d) between Nitrobenzene Derivatives and

The distance is measured between
the center of mass (CM) of the aromatic ring of the nitrobenzene derivatives
and the graphene systems. The whole graphene systems were not considered
to compute CM. The part over which the aromatic ring of the interacting
nitrobenzene derivatives were lying (almost in parallel orientation)
was used to compute the CM of the graphene systems.

The ΔEB’s computed at
different levels are more or less similar, although the computed values
at higher basis sets and at the MP2 level are slightly lower than
those at the DFT/cc-pVDZ computations. This could be due to the fixed
geometry (from DFT/cc-pVDZ results) used in such calculations. All
of these binding energies (DFT levels) are dispersion (ΔEdisp)-corrected, as discussed in Section 2. The approximation used in
dispersion correction (Section 2) could be justified by computation of binding energies through
full-geometry optimizations with the inclusion of the empirical GD3
function. The results for the GR···p-nitrophenol (DFT/cc-pVDZ level) case is included in Table 2, and the computed
binding energies do not differ from those using the approximation
as discussed. The Gaussian code actually performs such geometry optimization
through the inclusion of GD3 empirical dispersion energy to the nuclear
repulsion term in each optimization cycle. Thus, in the case of fully
optimized geometry (without dispersion correction), addition of dispersion
energy at the final stage is almost equivalent to the full-geometry
optimization technique, including dispersion effect, and thus the
empirical approach for dispersion correction for binding energies
is fully logical.

There are not too many experiments to justify
the computed binding
energies for the present systems. In recent years, experiments have
been carried out to estimate adsorption energies (ΔGad) of nitrobenzene, m-dinitrobenzene,
and p-nitrotoluene on graphene surface.66 The adsorption isotherm was computed using Freundlich
and Langmuir techniques. The experimental equilibrium binding constants KF and KL from Freundlich
and Langmuir isotherms, respectively, could be used to compute ΔGad values (ΔGads) for these systems. The magnitudes of ΔGads for nitrobenzene, m-nitrobenzene,
and p-nitrotoluene are −5.3, −5.8,
and −5.8 kcal/mol, respectively, using KF (7247.34 ± 228.49 19195.1 ± 752.0, 18645.5 ±
737.6 [(mg/kg)/(mg/L)N; N = 1 here] for the respective cases),66 whereas they are, respectively, −4.2, −5.1, and −5.4
using KL (0.0118 ± 0.00216, 0.0569
± 0.0128, 0.0939 ± 0.0176 (L/mg) for the respective cases).66 Our computed ΔGB° values (Tables 1 and 2) show that they are not very different
from the experiment (−2.6, −3.7, and −5.8 kcal/mol
for the respective systems). The exact matching is not possible, as
the computed values are in the gas phase. The overestimated CP correction
through double-ζ basis set could also contribute to such deviation
from experiment. The computed values, of course, maintain the same
trend in ΔGB° with respect
to the experiment, and the results thus give us confidence that the
computed binding energies could be used for Hammett correlation analysis.

3.2 Binding Energies and Hammett Correlation
There are several interesting features related to the binding energies
of aromatic nitro compounds on GR, 3BGR,
and 3NGR. The binding energies for o- and p-substituted nitroaromatics cases are more
or less similar on all of these scaffolds. The ΔEB values of the nitroaromatics are much higher than the
interactions of benzene with GR, BGR, and NGR. These values are available in Table 1, and it should be noted that the positive
ΔGB° values predict the benzene···GR/BGR/NGR interactions to be relatively
unstable. The general trend is that the ΔEBs (ΔHB° and ΔGB° values as well) increase with the increase
of the number of substituents in the nitroaromatic ring. It should
be noted that regardless of the ortho or meta orientation of the group
X in the nitroaromatics, ΔEB is
always greater than that for the nitrobenzene···GR/3BGR/3NGR interactions. The computed
ΔEBs for the various disubstituted
nitroaromatics (Tables 1–4) further show that it increases
with various m- and p-substituents
depending on their electron redistribution effect on the aromatic
ring, although the changes of distance (Table 5) between the interacting systems are not
very significant. These distances were measured as the distance between
the center of mass of the aromatic rings of the nitroaromatics and
the GR/3BGR/3NGR scaffold,
as shown in Scheme 1. With further increase of substituents in the nitroaromatics (Tables 1–4), there are further increment in the ΔEB values. These trends were also observed previously
by several authors in the case of benzene···substituted
benzene dimers.41,42 The molecular electrostatic potential
(MEP) maps for three representative cases are shown in Figure 1. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the MEP maps of several more
of such interactions together with the corresponding nitroaromatic
components. The pictures show that the individual MEPs of the nitroaromatics
do not show any significant change with respect to the composite system.
This particular feature indicates that these π–π
interactions are mostly dominated by dispersion and the electrostatic
contributions for stabilizing effect.

It is customary to plot ΔEBs
against Hammett σ-parameters44 to
investigate the validity of Hammett correlation in cases of π–π
stacking. Several authors did such analysis for the benzene-substituted
benzene interactions, and a brief account of the validity of ∑|σm| parameters instead of ∑σm was given in Introduction in relation to the previous findings.42 In the present cases also, the plots of ΔEBs versus ∑σm and ∑σp parameters (Table S1) do not produce decent linear correlations,
although the correlations between ΔEB and ∑σm are somewhat better
than those of the corresponding ∑σp cases (Figure S6, Supporting
Information). These types of correlations could be partly successful
if only electron-withdrawing monosubstituted cases are considered,
as was done by Houk and Wheeler in their earlier studies on benzene···substituted
benzene dimers.41 Because in the present
investigations we are studying only the cases of aromatic nitro-derivatives,
the consideration of such specific features is out of scope here.

The plots of ΔEBs versus ∑|σm| (Table S1) for
the nitroaromatics produce reasonably good linear correlations for
all of the interacting dimers of nitroaromatics with GR/3BGR/3NGR (r: correlation
coefficient > 0.92 for all three scaffolds). ΔEBs at various levels, viz. DFT/M06 (cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ,
and sp-aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets) and MP2/cc-pVDZ, show more or less
similar correlations. Only the correlations through DFT/M06/cc-pVDZ
calculations are shown here (Figure 2), and the others are documented in the Supporting
Information (Figure S7). This policy is
also adopted for the other analysis throughout the manuscript (considering
the total amount of analyzed data). The plots of ΔEBs versus ∑|σp| (Table S1) for the nitroaromatics are
not as impressive as the ∑|σm| cases, but they still show reasonable correlation in the present
molecular domain (Figure 2, cc-pVTZ). The best r value in most of the
cases is >0.9. The linear correlation is slightly weaker for these
nitrobenzene interactions with 3NGR. The results of such
correlation using other basis sets and MP2/cc-pVDZ are shown in Figure S8 (Supporting Information), and they
also indicate that linear correlation exits in such cases.

nitrobenzene derivatives (Tables 1 and 2) at the DFT/M06/cc-pVDZ
level. (A) Correlations of GR (blue line and black dots;
ΔEB = −4.22∑|σm| – 12.92, n = 14, r = 0.9), 3BGR (red line; ΔEB = −3.85∑|σm| – 13.84, n = 14, r = 0.91),
and 3NGR (green line; ΔEB = −4.04∑|σm| –
13.69, n = 14, r = 0.87) (r: correlation coefficient) interacting with m-substituted and other higher substituted nitrobenzene derivatives.
(B) Correlations of GR (blue line; ΔEB = −4.26∑|σp| – 11.98, n = 14, r = 0.91), 3BGR (red line; ΔEB = −3.86∑|σp| – 13.45, n = 14, r = 0.91), and 3NGR (green line; ΔEB = −3.92∑|σp| – 12.90, n = 14, r = 0.80) interacting with p-substituted
and other higher substituted nitrobenzene derivatives. Similar correlations
through M06/cc-pVTZ, M06/sp-aug-cc-pVTZ, and MP2/cc-pVDZ calculations
are shown in Figures S6 and S7 (Supporting
Information).

The Hammett equation44 usually predicts
a linear correlation of ΔGB°
against the σ-parameters from the relation 3  where KB should
be taken as the binding constant for the interactions between the
graphene (and doped graphene) and the substituted aromatic system
(substituted nitrobenzenes for our specific cases) and K0 is the same constant for any reference system. From eq 3, one can easily show by
multiplying both sides with RT (R: universal gas constant, T: absolute temperature)
that 4  This is a linear relation between ΔGB° and σ. Because ΔG = ΔH – TΔS (H: enthalpy and S: entropy), one can generate
similar relation between ΔHB°
and σ (eq 5). 5  We have neglected
the difference (TΔSB – TΔS0), as it is too small.
The plots of ∑|σm| parameters
of nitrobenzene derivatives versus ΔGB°/ΔHB° generate linear
correlations, which are shown in Figure S9 (Supporting Information) as predicted in eqs 4 and 5. Linear correlations
were observed for all of the three scaffolds, viz. GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR. Similar correlations
were also observed with respect to the ∑|σp| parameters (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The ΔG0°/ΔH0° terms in eqs 4 and 5 are absorbed in the correlation equations in the intercept parameters
and the prefactor term of σ. Because ΔHB and ΔEB are more or
less similar, the use of ΔEB to
monitor the validity of Hammett correlation is justified.

One
can compare the strength of such Hammett correlations from
the slopes of the linear correlations (called ρ values) as shown
in the caption of Figure 2. If ρ > 1, it could be interpreted as a measure
of
strong Hammett correlation (following the original interpretation
of ρ as reaction constant for the reactions of various m- and p-substituted benzene derivatives).67 The slopes of Hammett correlations of ΔEBs versus both ∑|σm| (slopes for GR: 4.22, 3BGR: 3.85, 3NGR: 4.04) and ∑|σp| (slopes for GR: 4.26, 3BGR: 3.86, 3NGR: 3.92) are available in Figure 2. According to the concept
of ρ, the Hammett correlation is quite strong in such cases
and the strengths are more or less equivalent, although correlations
in the case of GR are always slightly stronger. Such
analysis could be extended for other correlations also (as presented
in Figures S7–S9, Supporting Information).
The comparison of such ρ values with arene···arene
interactions is not straightforward, as a few results are available
with σm correlation only. Wheeler
and Houk41 presented the correlation equation
between the interaction energies and σm values of benzene···substituted benzene complexes.
The computed ρ value for this case is 2.72, which indicated
a strong correlation comparable to our cases.

The logic behind
the use of ∑|σm|/∑|σp| parameters
in such correlations has been discussed earlier (Introduction section), and it was proposed that these parameters
might take into account the contribution of electrostatic interactions
because ∑σm/∑σp parameters together with ∑Mr (Mr: molecular
refractivity) correlate jointly with ΔEB. Because Mr implicitly contains
molecular polarizability α through the relation Mr = 4/3(πNα) (N: Avogadro number), the contribution of electrostatic interactions
was indirectly predicted through such correlations. In the present
cases, we have found that ΔEB could
be satisfactorily correlated with the ∑|σm|/∑|σp|
and ∑Mr values of various nitroaromatics68 (Table S2) through
multiple correlations, as shown below (eqs 6–11).

GR···nitroaromatics (M06/cc-pVDZ) 6   7  3BGR···nitroaromatics
(M06/cc-pVDZ) 8   9  3NGR···nitroaromatics
(M06/cc-pVDZ) 10   11  The F statistics in the above
correlations show that correlations are significant and most satisfactory
for the GR···nitroaromatics interactions.
The deviations observed in the 3BGR and 3NGR could be attributed to the slight deviations of these scaffolds
from ideal π-characters, but still the correlations are significant.
The correlations using other basis sets (cc-pVTZ and sp-aug-cc-pVTZ)
and MP2/cc-pVDZ are shown in Table S3 (Supporting
Information). It should be noted that all of the M06 level correlations
are more or less similar. The correlations at the MP2/cc-pVDZ level
are somewhat weaker, but still show that the correlations at the M06
level are validated in such analysis. The somewhat weaker correlations
at the MP2 level are not unexpected, as the geometry of the complexes
was not optimized at this level.

The implicit contribution of
α in Mr has further prompted us
to investigate the direct effect
of this parameter (as Δα with respect to benzene) in such
correlations. The parameter α is directly available in quantum
chemical calculations in isotropic form [α = 1/3(αxx + αyy + αzz)], and is an experimentally
observable quantity. Moreover, because Δα represents the
effect of electronic redistribution due to substitution of various
functional groups in benzene, correlation with Δα will
directly indicate the role of electrostatic and dispersion contributions
in the present interactions. The correlation presented below (eqs 12–17) shows that ΔEB correlates
satisfactorily with ∑|σm|/∑|σp| and Δα (Table S2).

GR···nitroaromatics
(M06/cc-pVDZ) 12   13  3BGR···nitroaromatics
(M06/cc-pVDZ) 14   15  3NGR···nitroaromatics
(M06/cc-pVDZ) 16   17  Table S4 (Supporting
Information) contains correlations using other basis sets (cc-pVTZ
and sp-aug-cc-pVTZ) at M06 and MP2 (cc-pVDZ) levels. The correlations
in most of the cases are impressive (r > 0.9),
although
in a few cases, the MP2 results are not as good as the M06 cases.
The situation is similar to that of ∑|σm|/∑|σp|, ∑Mr multiple correlations with ΔEB. Although the parameters, viz. r and F statistics, show impressive correlations,
reproducibility of ΔEB from the
above correlations need to be further tested. Figures S10–S13 (Supporting Information) show the correlations
of ΔEB with the predicted ΔEB from the multiple correlation equations, as
discussed above. The linear correlations using various basis sets
and techniques (M06 and MP2) are quite satisfactory in our present
molecular domain. The MP2 calculations in some cases (mostly in p-substituted compounds) have shown slightly weaker correlations
(r < 0.9, Figures S10–S13). These deviations were mostly observed during interactions of such
compounds with 3BGR and 3NGR. Previously,
lipophilicity parameter π (instead of Mr) was tried as ∑π in the correlation analysis
of benzene···substituted benzene interactions.42 We did not take into account such correlations,
as we are only studying the gas-phase situations.

3.3 Energy Decomposition Calculations
The success of ∑σm/∑σp, Mr/Δα
parameters correlating ΔEB’s
in the multiple correlations eqs 6–17, shows that the contribution
of the dispersion of electrostatic interactions is important in such
correlations and also generates the logic behind the intrinsic contributions
of such interaction terms in the correlations of ΔEB’s with ∑|σm|/∑|σp|. Such correlations
also generate further need to quantitatively analyze the contributions
of various interactions terms in such complex formation. Tables S5 and S6 (Supporting Information) show
the interaction energy components for m- and p-substituted nitrobenzenes, respectively (together with
derivatives with multiple substituents) at the Hartree–Fock
(HF) level, as discussed in eq 1, and the contribution of the dispersion interactions (ΔEdisp) ( EMP2(2) in eq 2). As it could be seen from Tables S5 and S6, the total interactions are repulsive at
the HF level. The attractive electrostatic (Eel(10)) and delocalization
(ΔEdelHF) are offset by the repulsive Heitler–London
exchange term (EexHL). The main stabilization arises from the
contribution of the ΔEdisp term,
which is actually contribution from dispersion and higher-order correlations
with the HF components.

Figure 3 represents a bar chart representation of the contributions
of the attractive Eel(10) and ΔEdisp terms in the interactions between GR/3BGR/3NGR and the various m-substituted
nitrobenzenes as well as the derivatives with multiple substituents
(as shown in Table S5). Although ΔEdisp shows substantial contribution in stabilization
of the complexes in MP2 calculations, Eel(10) also plays
an important role here. This is evident from the magnitude of the
repulsive EexHL term in such calculations. If the ΔEdisp, EexHL, and ΔEdelHF terms are added, the total stabilization coming out through such
contributions becomes almost equal to the contribution from Eel(10). Figure 3 also contains
the contribution of empirical ΔEdisp term in the DFT calculations. These contributions are much smaller
than ΔEdisp in MP2 calculations
(EMP2(2)). This is quite obvious from the fact that the DFT calculations
already include electron correlation effects to show some stabilization
of the complexes. The empirical ΔEdisp here is only the unaccounted dispersion effect in such calculations.
This effect (empirical ΔEdisp) actually
makes the ΔEB values in DFT calculations
more or less similar with respect to the MP2 results (Tables 1–4), although the MP2 values are somewhat lower. Interaction energy
components for the p-substituted nitrobenzenes are
shown in Table S6 (Supporting Information).
Similar to the cases for m-substituted compounds,
the p-substituted nitrobenzene derivatives also show
that the interactions with GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR are mostly due to Eel(10) and ΔEdisp contributions.

Figure 3 Bar chart graphs comparing the contributions
of Eel(10) and
ΔEdisp in GR (A)/3BGR (B)/3NGR (C) interactions with various m-substituted and several di- and tri-substituted nitrobenzene
derivatives (Table 1) through energy decomposition analysis. The red and blue bars, respectively,
represent ΔEdisp (MP2) and Eel(10) contributions. The empirical dispersion contributions at the M06/cc-pVDZ
level (green bars) are also included for comparison. The magnitudes
of these parameters with other decomposition energy components are
available in Table S5 (Supporting Information).
The nitrobenzene derivatives (a–n) are same in all of the three
panels and are in the same order (from the top) as in Table 1. The results for p- and higher nitrobenzene derivatives are available in the Supporting
Information (Table S6).

The symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT)
analysis69 of the interactions between
benzene and substituted
benzenes at the DFT level42 indicated that
the sum of the energy components ΔEdisp + ΔEex + ΔEind (ΔEex: exchange
component; ΔEind: induction component)
is more or less constant for such interactions. The ΔEex in SAPT and the EexHL component in
our present study are more or less similar, but the ΔEind and ΔEdelHF components
are not totally similar. Although ΔEdelHF is associated
with the relaxation of electron densities of monomers upon interaction
restrained by the Pauli principle,58,59 (charge delocalization
together with charge-transfer interactions), ΔEind is associated with the interactions associated with
interactions arising from the charges due to the deformation of the
monomer units. Hence, ΔEdisp + EexHL + ΔEdelHF is not constant and varies depending on the
associated charge-transfer terms in ΔEdelHF. The Eel(10) term increases the binding for both the strong electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating substituents and makes almost equal contribution
with respect to ΔEdisp + EexHL + ΔEdelHF (Tables S5 and S6). Thus, ∑σm (or ∑σp) together with ∑Mr or Δα terms is needed to predict ΔEB in the present cases. This observation also
concurs with the results of previous SAPT analysis on the benzene···substituted
benzene interactions.42

It is to
be remembered that these results hold for the gas-phase
cases. Because our computed ΔGB°
have close resemblance with several experimental results for molecules
adsorbed on graphene (as discussed earlier), the propositions for
the correlations, as suggested, could also hold for condensed phase.
No comments could be made regarding the solvent effect as the GR systems chosen do not have any solubility information.
Thus, the proposition of Cockfroft and Hunter regarding70 the absolute dominance of the electrostatic
term (in benzene···substituted benzene interactions)
cannot be tested here. But it is obvious that Eel(10) is one of
the dominating factors in stabilizing such interactions. The Eel(10) term has some more features in such interactions, and it was also
the primary observation of Hunter and Sanders40 in relation to the benzene···substituted benzene
interactions. Our analysis showed that the stabilizing effects in Eel(10) are mostly coming from charge–charge interactions. But the
dipole–dipole, dipole–quadruple, and quadruple–quadruple
terms also have contributions. The contribution of the other contributing
terms are not very significant. Because the nitrobenzene derivatives
chosen for such interactions mostly have appreciable dipole moments
(Table S2) and polarizabilities, these
contributions of higher-order electrostatic terms in Eel(10) are
justified. The exceptions in the present cases are p-dinitrobenzene, p-cyanonitrobenzene, and a few
other nitrobenzene derivatives with multiple substitutions, where
the dipole moment is either zero or very low (Table S2). In such cases, the contribution of the Eel(10) component is also low (Tables S5 and S6). The charge–charge and dipole–quadruple terms mostly
contribute to the stabilizing Eel(10) component.

4 Conclusions
We have investigated the applicability of Hammett
parameters in
extended π-systems, where geometry restrictions were not needed.
Three different model graphene systems, viz. GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR, were designed as extended π-systems,
and interactions of various nitroaromatics were monitored using M06/cc-pVDZ,
M06/cc-pVTZ, M06/sp-aug-cc-pVTZ, and MP2/cc-pVDZ levels of calculation.
The applicability of Hammett substituent constants (σm or σp) to
predict binding energies for π–π interactions has
been investigated previously on various benzene···m- and p-substituted benzene complexes.

There were several viewpoints regarding the validity of such an
approach, but later it was shown that the sum of the absolute values
of σm (∑|σm|) did reasonably good job in such prediction. The
∑σp parameters also did show
similar linear correlations to ΔEB, although such correlations were weaker with respect to ∑|σm| parameters. The ∑|σm| parameters were assumed to contain the effect of
dispersion (or polarizability) as these parameters together with ∑Mr parameters showed good correlations with ΔEB. The geometry of the complexes in such studies
were restricted to PFF orientation to enforce π–π
interactions for the applicability of the Hammett parameters. The
optimized structures (M06/cc-pVDZ level), in our present investigation,
showed these structures to be in OSFF orientation, but because of
the extended π-systems of GR, 3BGR, and 3NGR, the nitroaromatics were always experiencing
π–π interactions. The ΔEB in all of the three different interactions showed good
correlations with ∑|σm| and
∑|σp| parameters. Moreover,
the convincing multiple regression analysis using ∑σm and ∑σp and Mr and Δα showed that,
like benzene···substituted benzene cases, these interactions
have contributions from dispersion and electrostatic components.

The energy decomposition analysis for the interactions showed that
electrostatic interactions together with ΔEdisp are important factors in such interactions. The Eel(10) components in such interactions have almost equal stabilizing contribution
with respect to the ΔEdisp + EexHL + ΔEdelHF interaction energy components, and this contribution
varies depending on the ∑|σm| and ∑|σp| values. Furthermore, Eel(10) always shows stabilizing effect regardless of the nature of substituents
of the nitrobenzene derivatives. A further analysis of the Eel(10) terms indicated the contributions of the dipole–dipole, dipole–quadruple,
and quadruple–quadruple terms in shaping up the total electrostatic
contributions in such interactions and thereby giving some physical
background to the importance of ∑Mr and Δα multiple regression equations to predict ΔEBs. Most of these observations are more or less
similar to the conclusions of the previous investigations on benzene···substituted
benzene systems, which indicates the applicability of Hammett correlation
constants to predict ΔEB in OSFF
orientations, if scaffolds are designed in such a way that substituted
benzene systems cannot escape their π-cloud. The present observations
are valid in a limited domain of molecules, and a much wider range
of benzene derivatives are to be investigated to achieve a general
validity of such hypothesis.
