Being
a unique, simple, and inexpensive approach, continuous development
on the fluorescence-based technologies remains active in fluorescent
anticounterfeiting. A number of polymeric, nano-, carbon dot, and
rare-earth oxide materials were preferably explored for such applications,
but the complex synthesis, purity, and high cost are the major concerns
to make these materials accessible for commercial applications. To
address these difficulties, we herein report simple mono-carbazole-linked
anthranyl π-conjugates that are synthesized in a gram scale
via an inexpensive and convenient route. These unsymmetrically substituted
new π-conjugates are found to be promising blue-shifted aggregation-induced
emission-active fluorogens (AIEgens) having a distinct color on varying
substituents with electron-rich (−NEt2) and electron-poor
(−CN) functionalities. The direct link of a single carbazole
unit with an anthracenyl π-conjugate possibly enforces the achievement
of a highly twisted molecular structure, accountable for the AIE characteristics.
The π-conjugate with −NEt2 substituents is
established to be highly sensitive under protonation–deprotonation
stimuli by a sharp and rapid fluorescence color change [yellow (Φf = 37%) to green (Φf = 39.4%)] in the solid
state (no fluorescence on/off). Upon the exposure of the base vapors
(deprotonation), the original emission color (yellow) comes back.
Such reversible and also repeatable acidchromism is demonstrated to
be perfectly suitable for anticounterfeiting applications by marking
the AIEgen on the paper that shows the bright image of the AIEgen
under the UV torch (365 nm). Almost equal efficiencies by fabricating
on different surfaces such as polythene paper and a fresh leaf are
observed. While these spots can be duplicated with typical yellow
fluorescent dyes, our AIEgen can easily be differentiated with the
acid key. The emission color change of this AIEgen from yellow to
green under acid stimuli is distinctly defined compared to other dyes
and vividly recognized by naked eyes. Thus, one can combat the counterfeiters
with the acid key. The reversible color-changing behavior on the paper
remains intact even after six consecutive days of exposure to sunlight,
and the AIEgen is thermally stable up to 445 °C. Further, this
compound is also utilized as ink (10 μM 1,4-dioxane solution)
where a pigeon feather is used as a quill pen. The mechanistic insights
behind these facts have also been proposed and validated wherever
possible.

Introduction
The economic growth
of a society is largely hampered by the counterfeiting
business on a variety of products even related to health and security.1 The overall impact brings a high risk to mankind,
and a potential strategy needs to be implemented to prevent it. Development
of effective and permanent anticounterfeiting methods is practically
challenging. There are numerous existing methods, and nevertheless,
counterfeiters keep finding the alternative path to break the tricks.1,2 The chemical method is identified as one of the developing cost-effective
tools for anticounterfeiting applications that can generate easily
detectable chemical tags.2 In this context,
the luminescent materials are significantly explored in anticounterfeiting
applications as a most convenient and low-cost approach.3 Many such fluorescent materials are available
in the literature, but most of them have quite limited access and
a complex nature that restrict the scope for real and commercial uses.4,5 The luminescent materials are visible under a UV torch of a specific
wavelength. However, tagging a new fluorescent dye will not solve
the problem because the counterfeiters can easily find similar duplicate
fluorescent dyes that are available in the market. To avoid such an
issue, stimuli-responsive fluorescent materials would be beneficial
where stimuli will act as a key. In this context, we herein report
a mono-carbazole-linked anthranyl π-conjugate as a small and
easily accessible stimuli-responsive AIEgen. Notably, both anthracene6,7 and carbazole8−13 were individually identified with their unique properties in the
field of optoelectronics. The thorny obstacle with anthranyl derivatives
was to experience fluorescence quenching in the aggregate state due
to the flat and rigid framework.14 Thus,
the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) property of anthracene was
detrimental to execute real-world applications.15 Later, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) for anthranyl
compounds was detected mainly for distyrylanthracene (DSA) derivatives.16 Also, much smaller anthracene-based AIEgens
were reported by us.17−19 Being a hole transporter, luminescent, thermally
stable, and electronically rich, single or multiple carbazole units
were linked with various conjugated systems such as triarylethylene20,21 and polymers.22 In fact, covalently linked
anthracene-carbazole fluorophores (1a and 1b, Chart 1) were reported
to be efficient blue-emitting materials and used for organic light-emitting
diode (OLED)-based applications.23

Chart 1 Reported
Anthracene-Carbazole compounds and Their Applications
The modified DSA (1c, Chart 1) carrying oligocarbazole units was developed
as a promising AIEgen,24 while the compound 1d was unable to exhibit the AIE property due to the lack
of molecular symmetry.25 However, the synthetic
paths to access these directly linked anthracene-carbazole compounds
including 1c are relatively expensive. The remarkable
applications of such molecules and a variety of light-emitting properties
with a subtle change in the molecular structure encouraged us to generate
new carbazole-linked anthranyl π-conjugates in a metal-free
simple synthetic route and study their AIE properties. With our current
interest,26 we introduce the tertiary amine
functionality to the fluorophore to make it useful in exhibiting a
sharp reversible change in the solid-state emission behavior under
protonation and deprotonation stimuli. Such luminescent materials
are tagged in the paper tagged with other fluorescent materials and
are found differences under the acid key. It was found to be very
much unique compared to the previously existing fluorescent marks.
Further, 10 μM 1,4-dioxane solution is utilized as a multicolor
ink to write with a quill pen (pigeon feather) on a piece of filter
paper where there were clearly readable yellow letters under the UV
torch, and the letters are reversibly changed to green under acid/base
vapors. Moreover, the reversible emission color-changing behaviors
under protonation–deprotonation stimuli facilitate the reusability
of the fluorophore.

Results and Discussion
As a suitable
precursor for olefination reactions, carbazole-linked
anthranylphosphonate (CBZP) is easily synthesized by a methanesulfonic
acid-mediated Friedel–Crafts-like reaction of α-hydroxyphosphonate
(2) with only N-heptylcarbazole (without
further functionalization, Scheme 1). The phosphonate was isolated with high purity and
characterized by different spectroscopic methods.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Carbazole-Linked
Anthranyl π-Conjugates
Subsequently, CBZP was utilized to access the π-conjugates 3a (with an electron-withdrawing group, −CN) and 3b (with electron-donating NEt2). In spite of being
a traditional route, the access of such unsymmetrically substituted
π-conjugates with high yields in a straightforward and cost-effective
path is advantageous. The yield is very much comparable for both electron-withdrawing
and -donating substituents. Thus, the use of expensive metals is completely
avoided to make a direct link between carbazole and anthracene. Although
characterized by FT-IR, NMR, and mass spectroscopy, these compounds
are amorphous in nature, and therefore no single crystals could be
grown in spite of several attempts.

Owing to the typical ACQ
tendency of the fluorophore, generating
new small AIEgens is always a challenge7 as shown in Chart 1 (1c: AIEgen; 1d: non-AIEgen), we focus
on studying the AIE behaviors for these two π-conjugates 3a and 3b. The absorption maxima are found at
∼400 nm for both 3a and 3b due to
π–π* transitions (Figure S1: for all absorption and emission spectra of 3a and 3b), and emission maxima are identified around ∼530
nm in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetonitrile (MeCN, Figure 1). However, there is not much
a significant difference in the absorption spectra by changing the
solvent polarity as expected,19 and the
solvatofluorochromic behavior was observed for these compounds (a
23 nm shift for 3a and 51 nm shift for 3b in emission λmax, Figure 1) by varying the solvent polarity of hexane
to MeOH.

Figure 1 Normalized emission spectra for (a) 3a and (b) 3b (10–5 M) in different solvents (λex = 405 nm). The images of (c) 3a and (d) 3b under a 365 nm UV lamp (10–5 M) in the
following solvents: (i) cyclohexane, (ii) hexane, (iii) CCl4, (iv) dioxane, (v) tetrahydrofuran (THF), (vi) CHCl3,
(vii) CH2Cl2, (viii) acetonitrile (MeCN), and
(ix) MeOH.

The photophysical parameters for
compounds 3a and 3b are tabulated in Table S1. Both
these compounds fluoresce more in a relatively nonpolar solvent such
as hexane and CCl4 (Table S1) possibly by emitting from locally excited (LE) states, while the
more polar solvent facilitates decay from intramolecular charge transfer
(CT) states. The twisted intramolecular charge transfer in the excited
state is well recognized as a possible origin for such fluorosolvatochromism.27,28 The pronounced solvent effect with a 51 nm shift for compound 3b indicates that this compound is comparatively more suitable
to emit from the CT state in a polar solvent. Thus, the compound 3b is a better donor–acceptor fluorophore than 3a, although 3a with the −CN functionality
would have better CT character. The cyano group for such systems was
found to be not in the plane of the aromatic ring,19 and eventually, the impact of the electron-withdrawing
effect for the cyano group is subtle.

However, with our main
focus to search new AIEgens, acetonitrile
is preferred as a solvent because the fluorophores are almost nonfluorescent
[quantum yield (Φf) for 3a: 1.1% and 3b: <1%, Table S1]. Upon gradual
addition of water (as a poor solvent) to the acetonitrile solution
(10 μM) of 3a and 3b independently,
a sudden enhancement in the relative fluorescence (Fl.) intensity was observed at fw = 50–70%
(fw = fraction of water (v/v%), in acetonitrile; Figure 2).

Figure 2 AIE studies for (a) 3a and (b) 3b; (10–5 M in MeCN)
with different fw values in MeCN. λex = 365 nm. The colored
images of the aggregates are shown as insets.

Interestingly, the compound 3a exhibited a green emission
maximum (λmax = 526 nm) at fw = 70% with 20 times fluorescence intensity enhancement compared
with that in the solution state, and 3b showed a yellow
emission (λmax = 553 nm) maximum at fw = 50% with 10 times the increment. Thus, the change
of the electronic effect could display a difference in the emission
wavelength for this series of compounds. (Figure S2 for UV–vis for AIE studies). Typically, the origin
of the AIE properties is proved to be the restricted intramolecular
motions (RIM) along with slight red shifts.29 Interestingly, the observed blue-shifted emission maxima (29 nm
prominent in the case of 3b, while for 3a, 7 nm) on aggregation compared with the molecular state indicate
the lack of conjugation in the aggregate state due to the nonplanarity
of the molecular structure. When the molecules form aggregates with
each other due to poor solubility in water, the polarity effect surrounding
the molecules is reduced to result in a blue shift in emission.30 The average particle sizes at the emission maxima
were measured by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) study, which exhibited
the sizes of 120 nm for 3a and 111 nm for 3b (Figure S3). The formation of such nanoaggregates
is also supportive of such AIE behavior.29 To find the role of the carbazole unit in exhibiting AIE behavior,
the analogous π-conjugate 4 (without a carbazole
link) is synthesized as shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of the Carbazole Unsubstituted
π-Conjugate
The compound 4 is recognized as fluorescent in the
solution state and almost nonemissive in the aggregate state (Figure 3), which is established
as a non-AIE-active molecule.

Figure 3 UV–vis and fluorescence spectra of 4 in MeCN
and fw = 99%, a non-AIE compound.

Hence, the presence of carbazole perhaps is a key
factor to make
the molecule AIE-active. Such an observation also confirms the twisted
molecular conformations for 3a and 3b, which
possibly originated from the linked carbazole. The twisted conformations
restrict the intramolecular motion (RIM) in the solid state to facilitate
the molecular relaxation from the excited state through the radiative
pathways.30 The molecule 4 is expected to have strong intermolecular π–π
stacking among anthracene rings in the aggregate state, suppressing
the radiative decay. The amorphous features of these carbazole compounds
are very much disadvantageous to grow a single crystal to study the
molecular packing. However, with support from the literature,8−15 we speculate that the carbazole ring is considerably twisted for
both the compounds. To support our speculation, the molecular structure
of compound 3b is optimized using DFT (density functional
theory) studies where the carbazole ring is twisted almost 80°
with the anthracenyl core (Figure 4). It specifies significantly weak electronic conjugations
between the anthracenyl ring and carbazole unit. The olefinic part
is in a 56° torsion angle with the anthranyl core, indicating
a better electronic conjugation with the arylamine part. Such a twisted
conformational structure can only enhance the fluorescence property
in the solid state by RIM, and thus we explain the fluorescence property
in the solid state.

Figure 4 Optimized molecular geometry of 3b (in the
gas phase)
based on DFT studies (CAMB3LYP/6-31G). The dihedral angles (°)
are also shown.

Both the π-conjugates 3a and 3b are thermally and photochemically stable
in both solution and solid
states (verified by observing the sample for four months). The thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA, Figure S4) reveals the Td (decomposition temperature) for compound 3a (350 °C) and 3b (445 °C), whereas
compound 4 decomposes at only 124 °C. Thus, the
attached carbazole unit not only governs the AIE properties but also
contributes to achieving a high Td. Notably,
the carbazole unit is known to enhance the thermal stability of the
compounds.22

Being yellow in fluorescence
in the solid state (Φf = 37%), 3° amine-containing
compound 3b is utilized
as a platform for reversible acidchromism. The fluorometric detection
of acid vapor in the solid state would be operationally simple, cost
effective, and convenient. Upon exposure to acid vapor (2.5 M aqueous
solution of HCl), the yellow fluorescence of 3b peaked
at 565 nm is rapidly changed to green fluorescence peaked at 524 nm
with marginally enhanced intensity (Φf = 39.4%) (Figure 5a,b). Moreover, the
emission color change due to the deprotonation is reversible in the
presence of triethylamine (TEA)/ammonia vapor. The emission maximum
at 565 nm is reverted from 524 nm (Figure 5a,b). The 41 nm blue shift and the reversibility
nature of such materials are thought to be utilized in anticounterfeiting
applications, which can be vividly examined with the naked eye by
using a simple 365 nm UV torch.

Figure 5 (a) Reversible color change of 3b on HCl/TEA treatment
on a glass surface and repeatability for multiple cycles; (b) corresponding
solid-state Fl. spectra (λex = 405 nm). The absolute
quantum yield is measured using a calibrated integrating sphere with
an error limit of ± 5%. We have diluted 12 M HCl to 2.5 M HCl
in an aqueous solution as it could also generate the acid vapor at
room temperature.

Several acids inclusive
of H2SO4, HNO3, CF3SO3H, and CF3CO2H are tested and a similar
reversible color change is noticed
by exposing to basic vapors (NH3 or TEA). Such reversibility
in color change was sustainable by protonation–deprotonation
treatment for multiple times (see the inset plot, Figure 5a). Thus, the performance of
this material is validated with two important parameters, that is,
reversibility and repeatability. Notably, the reports on reversible
acidchromism in the solid state are limited with tetraphenylethylene-spiropyran31 and pyridinyl fluorophores32,33 that could be accessed only by multistep Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions.
In most of the cases, the fluorescence switching on–off was
observed on deprotonation–protonation,26,34 while the change in the emission color reported herein is sparse
in the literature.

Anticounterfeiting Applications
Based on the above
discussion, this fluorescence probe looks to be appropriate for the
anticounterfeiting applications in many ways. The luminescent material 3b can be tagged in different shapes to any commercial packaging
or cover and can be detected under a UV torch. However, there are
many such molecules that can be utilized for this purpose, and duplication
might be a serious concern. In such a case, the stimuli-responsive
materials are advantageous as the stimuli will act as the key that
may not be available with counterfeiters. With this awareness, we
have made a hexagon shape on a piece of paper (earlier tagged with
few other fluorescent materials) using 10 μM solution of 3b, which was not visible under the normal light (Figure 6a) but was prominent
under the 365 nm UV torch as a yellow hexagon (Figure 6b) along with many other hitherto existing
yellow and red fluorescent marks (Figure 6b); however, the yellow hexagon could be
easily recognized. Upon exposure to an acid vapor, the yellow hexagon
is changed to green, while other fluorescent marks remain unaffected.
Thus, even if it is a fake yellow fluorescent color, it can be easily
identified with the help of acid vapors acting as a key to combat
counterfeiters. The fluorescent color on the paper was intact even
by exposing to strong sunlight (with an environment temperature of
42 °C) for six consecutive days. The reversible and repeatable
acid-chromic nature also helps to reuse the material for multiple
times.

under the 365 nm UV torch, (c) and fumed with HCl vapor (2.5 M aqueous
solution of HCl) and reversible chromism using NH3 vapor
under a 365 nm UV torch.

In addition, we have
also explored the possibility of fabrication
on different surfaces to expand the scope of utility. As polythene
is exorbitantly used for multiple purposes, we have tested the AIEgen 3b on a surface of polythene, and the molecule shows a prompt
emission color change from yellow to green under acid stimuli (Figure 7). With our curiosity,
compound 3b is tested on a surface of a fresh green leaf
that shows yellow emission with almost equal efficiencies to other
surfaces, and yellow-to-green color change upon acid exposure becomes
prominent as shown in the Figure 7d–f.

light, (b) under
a 365 nm UV lamp, (c) fumed with HCl vapor (2.5 M aqueous solution

in ambient light, (e) under a 365 nm UV lamp, and (f) fumed with HCl
vapor (2.5 M aqueous solution of HCl) under a 365 nm UV lamp on a
green leaf surface.

Application as a Multicolor
Ink for a Quill Pen
This
fluorescent material 3b (10 μM in 1,4-dioxane)
has further been used as a multicolor ink that helps to write on paper
or any other surface, visible as yellow letters under a UV torch.
This writing can be easily monitored or prevented from counterfeiting
as the letters will be emitting green upon exposure to acid vapors
(Figure 8).

colors on a TLC plate under protonation–deprotonation stimuli.
The writing is performed by a cotton swab with a 10–5 M solution of 3b in 1,4-dioxane. The photograph was
taken under a 365 nm UV torch.

To expand further, we attempt to use quills (pigeon feathers) to
write the letters on a piece of Whatman filter paper using the 10
μM 1,4-dioxane solution of 3b as ink. As a primary
writing instrument, quills were used to write scripts, and it was
one of the most cost-effective and easily accessible natural tools
in the ancient age. Hence, the solution of 3b is used
as ink for a quill pen to write on a piece of Whatman filter paper
as pictured in Figure 9. Nowadays, such a quill pen can be seen only in a museum or sometimes
as a gift item to save the origin of writings in the Stone Age.

writing using the quill and (b) writing completed under ambient light,
(c) under a 365 nm UV lamp, (d) fumed with HCl vapor, and (e) exposed
with NEt3 vapor under a 365 nm UV lamp.

Mechanism on Acidchromism
As earlier stated, the solid-state
emitting property can be ascribed by the twisted molecular structure
that suppresses the ACQ behavior and activates the fluorescence enhancement
in the solid state. To give mechanistic insight into the observation
on reversible fluorescence color change under protonation–deprotonation
stimuli, the protonation of the tertiary amine is crucial. The protonation
has been confirmed by the 1H NMR studies (Figure 10) with a sharp broad peak
at δ 14.0 for the protonated amine (Figure 10b), which disappeared on the treatment of
triethylamine (Figure 10c). The expected proton shifts in the N–CH2CH3 group have been identified where the quartet
at δ 3.47 is shifted almost ∼0.3 ppm downfield with an
expected splitting pattern (Figure 10b). The reversibility is demonstrated by adding TEA
that brings the original spectrum back. Being conjugated with an electron
donor (amine) and acceptor system (anthracene), intramolecular charge
transfer upon photoexcitation (PCT) can take place for such a molecule,
which can induce the decay partly in a nonradiative pathway. However,
overall radiative decay governs the Φf = 37%, and
that is significant enough to visualize and utilize this material
to these applications. On protonation, the electron-donating ability
is reduced and leads to a blue-shifted emission. Thus, we can explain
the reversible color change from yellow to green by the protonation
and deprotonation method. The enhancement in the Φf on deprotonation could be due to the blockage of PCT that is very
well established in the literature.35,36

Figure 10 The reversible
protonation–deprotonation of 3b is proven by 1H NMR titration. The 1H NMR
spectra in CDCl3 of (a) the compound 3b, (b) 3b + 1equiv HCl, and (c) 3b + 1equiv HCl + 1equiv
TEA. The 12M HCl solution is used and maintained of the equivalency.
Commercially available anhydrous triethylamine (TEA) is used without
further purification.

Conclusions
The
monocarbazole-linked unsymmetrical anthranyl π-conjugates
are synthesized in a simple and cost-effective route and established
as promising blue-shifted AIEgens. The variation on the electronic
effect for this fluorophore leads to the emission at a different wavelength
(green or yellow) in the nanoaggregate state. The monocarbazole unit
is found to be sufficient to make the fluorophore AIE-active by attaining
a twisted molecular structure and thermally stable up to 445 °C.
The designed fluorophore with a stimuli-responsive property in the
solid state is judiciously placed for the development of an easily
accessible, convenient, cost-effective, and reusable solution to combat
counterfeiters. It has also been demonstrated on paper that is already
tagged with a few other fluorescent materials. The fabrications in
different surfaces such as polythene and the green leaf display the
range of the scope of this material. We have also utilized the molecule
as multicolor ink that can be written on a piece of filter paper using
a quill pen, and the fluorescence emission is changeable reversibly
under protonation–deprotonation stimuli. The protonation on
amine reduces the conjugation within the molecule that results in
the blue shift in emission and relatively enhanced fluorescence intensity
possibly by blocking the PCT.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All experiments were carried out in
hot air oven-dried glassware under a nitrogen or argon atmosphere.
Diethyl (anthracen-9-yl(hydroxy)methyl)phosphonate (2) was prepared following the literature procedure.17−19 All aldehydes,
carbazole, and alkyl bromide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium t-butoxide and methanesulfonic acid were purchased from
Alfa Aesar. THF was redistilled from a violet solution of a sodium
metal and benzophenone mixture. All other reagents were purchased
from common suppliers and used without further purification. Column
chromatography was performed by using silica gel of 100–200
mesh. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on precoated
silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck & Co.) and were visualized by
UV (mainly 365 nm). The 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution using Bruker
Advance DRX (400 and 500 MHz). The signals were referenced to TMS,
and the solvent used was deuterated chloroform (7.26 ppm in 1H NMR and 77.2 ppm in 13C NMR). Chemical shifts are reported
in parts per million, and multiplicities are indicated by s (singlet),
d (doublet), t (triplet), and dd (doublet of a doublet). High-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) is performed using Agilent infinity 1260.
The method used for sample monitoring is 10–100% B in 30 min
with 3 min equilibration at 10% B (A = water with 0.1% TFA (triflic
acid); B = acetonitrile with 0.08% TFA), and the column used for monitoring
is Agilent ZORBAX SB-C3, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm. The electronic
absorption spectra were recorded with UV 3600 Plus (Shimadzu). The
fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Hitachi spectrofluorometer
(F7000) using a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The DLS studies for
the sample were done using a Malvern particle size analyzer (Zeta
sizer Nano-ZS). APCI-LCMS was done in Shimadzu LCMS-2020. TGA was
carried out on a Shimadzu DTG-60 simultaneous DTA-TG apparatus with
a rate of temperature rising of 10 °C/min. All data were plotted
using Origin Pro 8.5 software.

AIE Studies
The
AIE study is performed using MeCN and
H2O mixture. The 10 μM concentration of the solution
is kept constant throughout the studies. The samples are prepared
as follows: fw = 90% (MeCN 200 μL
+ 1800 μL H2O), fw =
80% (MeCN 400 μL + 1600 μL H2O), and so on
(Table 1).

Absorption and Fluorescence
Studies
Absorption studies
are performed taking the sample (2 mL, 10–5 M) in
a quartz cuvette keeping the wavelength range of 550 to 250 nm. Emission
spectra are simultaneously recorded with the same sample used for
absorption. The excitation wavelength limit was kept from 415 to 750
nm with the excitation slit/emission slit 5.0 and a PMT voltage of
400 eV.

Solid-State Emission Study and Absolute Quantum Yield
The solid-state emission spectra were recorded placing the sample
in between two quartz slides. The absolute quantum yield is done for
the same sample using a calibrated integrating sphere. After that,
the sample was exposed to HCl vapors for 2 min and TEA vapors for
another 2 min, and the absolute quantum yields were measured.

DLS Study
The DLS samples were prepared by taking our
sample (10–5 M) in the aqueous solution in a reusable
plastic cuvette fitted with a cap.

NMR Titration
Compound 3b (0.010 gm) was
dissolved in CDCl3 (500 μL) followed by addition
of 1 equiv of 12 M HCl and 1 equiv of TEA to the same NMR tube.

Theoretical Section
DFT calculations are performed
in the gas phase using Gaussian 09 software with the CAMB3LYP exchange
correlation functional. For the ground-state geometry optimization,
all of the atoms were treated with the 6-31G basis set. The snapshot
of the geometry is generated using Mercury CSD 2.0 software.

Synthesis
and Characterization of CBZP
In a 25 mL round-bottom
flask, diethyl (anthracen-9-yl(hydroxy)methyl)phosphonate
(2) (1.000 g, 2.904 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of dry
dichloroethane in ice temperature followed by the addition of methanesulfonic
acid (0.398 mL, 5.808 mmol) and N-heptyl carbazole
(0.863 g, 2.904 mmol). The reaction was allowed to stir for 4 h. The
completion of reactions was monitored by a TLC plate. The reaction
mixture was quenched by water and extracted with dichloromethane (20
mL × 3). The organic layer was filtered and dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure. The compound
CBZP was purified by column chromatography using 40% ethyl acetate

(3a)
CBZP (0.500 g, 0.845 mmol) was subjected
to vacuum in a 50 mL round-bottom flask and was dissolved in dry THF
(10 mL) under an argon atmosphere (a standard balloon) at room temperature.
Next, t-BuOK (0.284 gm, 2.535 mmol) was added and
stirred for 4–5 min. 4-Formylbenzonitrile (0.121gm, 0.929 mmol)
was carefully added to the solution. The reaction was allowed to stir
for 3 h, and completion of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The
resulting reaction mixture was quenched with water, extracted with
ethyl acetate (20 mL × 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate,
and concentrated under a rotary evaporator. 3a was purified
by column chromatography using ethyl acetate and petroleum ether (5%
ethyl acetate in petroleum ether). HPLC purity: 89%. Compounds 3b and 4 were synthesized in a manner similar
to that of 3a, varying the aldehydes only. Yield: 0.800
