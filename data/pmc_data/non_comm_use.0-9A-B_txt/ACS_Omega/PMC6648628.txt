In the paper, graphene oxide (GO)
and two kinds of styrenic resins,
poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] (SEBS) and maleic anhydride (MA) grafted SEBS
(MA-g-SEBS), were utilized to explore the interfacial
interaction of carbon-based materials and block copolymers as layer-by-layer
(LBL) assembly films. The details of the interlayer interaction of
the two kinds of composite films were investigated through the analysis
of the mechanical properties and internal structure of the composites.
For the SEBS/GO composite film, the “interlock” structure
tended to form between the GO sheets and SEBS resin, and the physical
“interlocking effect” could make full use of the excellent
mechanical properties of GO nanosheets. As a result, both failure
strength and elongation at break of the SEBS/GO composite film were
enhanced by 50 and 25%, respectively. On the other hand, some different
structures were found in the MA-g-SEBS/GO composite
film, where the GO sheets stacked onto the resin closely because of
the chemical interaction between them and no obvious “interlocks”
was found within the interface, and the chemical interface interaction
was strong enough to prevent the slide of GO nanosheets under tension
after the graphene sheets were highly oxidized, so the mechanical
properties of the MA-g-SEBS/GO composite film could
be also enhanced. Based on an overall consideration of the research
results of these LBL assembled composites, choosing more perfect materials
and structures is needed, which should use physical and chemical interfacial
interactions more efficiently, to obtain better mechanical properties
of inorganic carbon–organic resin composites.

1 Introduction
Composites
have been designed to obtain stronger and tougher materials
in various fields since the very early time.1,2 Many
studies have been done on inorganic fillers and organic resin matrix.3,4 Among them, the interfaces between the filler and matrix is still
the key to improvement of the properties of the composites. In most
cases, the stronger the interfacial interaction is, the better some
properties of the composite are. Therefore, enhancing the interfacial
interaction of composites is the common strategy to produce composites
with excellent properties through chemical ways such as covalent bonding5 and hydrogen-bonding interactions.6 Zhao et al.7 fabricated
ultrathin PVA/GO composite films in which the existence of oxygen
functional groups located on both edges and basal plane of GO and
the hydroxyl groups in PVA chains makes it possible to apply LBL self-assembly
by hydrogen-bonding interaction. Furthermore, the covalent bonding
interaction was found in graphene-based nanocomposites.8−10 On the other hand, physical interfacial interaction has considerable
effect on the composite properties, which is, however, usually overlooked
by many researchers.11−13 Yang et al.14 reported
the presence of interlocks between platelets of nacre, and the physical
interaction was proved to be the key mechanism for the high toughness
and strength of nacre. In this report, we first fabricated LBL assembled
GO-based hybrid films using two kinds of styrenic block copolymer
(SBC) resins, aiming to study the effects of both chemical and physical
interfacial interactions, and to find out the key factor of improving
the properties of composites with the sandwich structure.

In
recent years, graphene, an atom-thick sheet carbon material,
has attracted tremendous scientific interests due to its unique structure
and novel electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties.15−21 With extremely high value of Young’s modulus, fracture strength,
and elastic modulus, graphene has great potential in the field of
composites.18,19,22 However, its high specific surface area and strong π–π
stacking have made it an intractable trouble to disperse homogenously
in the composite matrix. Besides, with no functional groups on the
planar, graphene can hardly form interfacial interaction with the
polymer matrix, which is undoubtedly disadvantageous to the properties
of composites. In order to achieve homogenous dispersion of graphene
and prevent the restacking of the flat sheets, surfactants can be
used to stabilize the suspension,23−26 but the surfactants may give
rise to other problems such as property decrease. Also, we can optimize
the polymer matrix with graphene prior to the chemical reduction27 in risk of damaging the construction of the
materials or the graphene sheets. Obviously, it will remain as a challenge
to make full use of graphene’s properties in the field of composites.
As a derivative of graphene, GO has emerged as a suitable alternative
nanomaterial, bonded to oxygen in the form of hydroxyl and epoxy groups
on the planar, as well as carboxyl groups on the edge.28−31 There has been extensive researches on GO-based composites that
could be applied in various fields. Negatively charged functionalized
graphene oxide layers were incorporated into polyelectrolyte multilayers
(PEMs) to fabricate LBL assembled membranes, and micromechanical measurements
showed enhancement of the elastic modulus by an order of magnitude,
from 1.5 GPa for pure LBL PEM membranes to approximately 20 GPa for
only 8.0 vol % graphene oxide encapsulated LBL membranes.32 Bao et al.33 used
cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and GO to produce flexible,
transparent high-barrier composite films, which exhibited excellent
properties and prospect for applications in flexible electronics.
Despite some decline of properties, the low-cost synthesis and superior
solution processability have made GO more possible for applications
in material science and composites.

It is also important to
choose an appropriate matrix to obtain
composites with high mechanical performance. Styrenic block copolymer
(SBC) is a good choice as a kind of thermoplastic elastomer with favorable
processability and recyclability, extensively used in many fields,
including protective materials.34 However,
as the requirement for strength and modulus grows fast, modification
of SBC is necessary to fabricate qualified material, and it is absolutely
a promising choice to be incorporated with GO. There has been a few
reports on GO/SBC nanocomposites. Cao et al.35 proposed a general and effective methodology to covalently functionalize
graphene oxide sheets (GOSs) with SEBS by taking advantage of click
chemistry, and the GOSs-c-SEBS could be applied as
the filler to enhance polymer composites. Grigorescu et al.36 fabricated the composite with graphene and MA-g-SEBS, improving the compatibility of graphene and the
polymer matrix. Esterification reaction took place by a “grafting
to” method between maleic anhydride group of MA-g-SEBS and the residual hydroxyl of graphene, enhancing the tensile
strength by 69%. Both researches effectively handled the problem of
dispersion of the filler through chemical modification, but in order
to prepare composites with highly protective properties, both effects
of the chemical and physical interfacial interactions between GO and
SBC should be made into full utility to optimize the mechanical properties,
which remains a challenging problem beyond the previous researches.
Therefore, it is meaningful to determine which kind of interfacial
interaction holds an advantage in improving the mechanical properties
in different cases, and the answer should be of great importance in
the future for the applications of the novel material GO in the field
of composites.

With keen interest, we started from investigating
the relationship
between the interface and mechanical properties within the GO/SBC
LBL assembled composite. The two kinds of resins used were poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] (SEBS) and maleic anhydride grafted poly[styrene-b-(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-styrene] (MA-g-SEBS), the latter of which could
form the chemical interfacial interaction with GO due to the grafted
maleic anhydride. LBL assembly has been an extensively accepted method
of fabricating organic–inorganic nanocomposites due to its
simplicity for assembling functional building blocks with controlled
type, morphology, internal organization, and molecular structure.37,38 As shown in Figure 1, it was applied to orient the GO nanoplatelets parallel to the surface
of the resin to maximize the attractive energy within the interface.

blending method and (b) GO-based hybrid composite fabricated by LBL
assembly.

2 Results and Discussion
SEM image of the cross section of the MA-g-SEBS/GO
hybrid film shown in Figure 2a proves that the expected sandwich structure was fabricated.
Samples for tensile tests are displayed in Figure 2b,c. As the number of the GO layer increases,
the color of the hybrid films turns from colorless to dark brown.
All the film samples for the tensile test were tailored into the shape
of rectangle with the size of 40 × 5 mm2 and a gauge
length of 20 mm. Filter paper was pasted onto both ends of the samples
to prevent the films from slipping out the fixture during tensile
tests.

hybrid film with three layers of GO. (b) Hybrid films containing
0/1/3/5/7 layers of GO. (c) Hybrid film with the size of 40 ×
5 mm2 and a gauge length of 20 mm.

Due to the limited amount of GO in hybrid films prepared
by the
LBL assembly method and the
fact that the oxygen-containing groups of GO will undergo pyrolysis
as the temperature increases, it is difficult to obtain the mass fraction
of GO in hybrid films by thermogravimetric analysis. In the preparation
process of hybrid films, the surface density of the GO film did not
change during the transfer process, and namely, the surface density
of the GO film formed on the surface of deionized water was the same
as that of the single layer of GO in the hybrid films. The culture
dish with a diameter of 17 cm was used to measure the surface density
of the GO film formed on the surface of deionized water. When the
water surface is completely covered by the GO film, the required GO
solution is 2.5 mL (5 mg/mL). The surface density of the single layer
of GO in the hybrid films is calculated as follows: 1  

Every hybrid film sample with the size of 5 × 40 mm2 and a thickness of 100 μm was weighed 20 ± 0.5
mg, and
the surface area was 2 cm2. Hence, it is concluded that
in the hybrid films containing 0/1/3/5/7 layers of GO, the mass fractions
of GO are 0, 0.53, 1.59, 2.65, and 3.71 wt %, respectively. For the
hybrid film with the maximum seven layers of GO, the content of GO
is only less than 5 wt %.

SEBS is a tri-block copolymer without
functional groups on the
molecular chains, and therefore, there is almost no chemical interfacial
interaction within its GO-based nanocomposite. However, the mechanical
properties of the SEBS/GO hybrid film improve a lot compared with
the pure SEBS film, as shown in Figure 3, which probably is due to the physical interaction
within the interface, namely, the as-mentioned interlock effect. Grafted
maleic anhydride is the only difference between the two kinds of resins,
which makes it possible to react with the oxygen-containing functional
groups on the planar of GO. Esterification reaction can take place
between maleic anhydride groups of the MA-g-SEBS
resin and the hydroxyl groups of GO. In addition, the polar groups
of the resin can improve the compatibility. Generally speaking, the
chemical interaction would enhance the interface and thus improve
the mechanical properties of the composite. However, it is interesting
that we do not see that the properties of the MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film were enhanced as expected from Figure 3.

curves of the pure SEBS film and SEBS/GO
hybrid film with four resin layers and three GO layers. (b) Stress–strain
curves of the pure MA-g-SEBS film and MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film with four resin layers and three GO
layers. (c) Tensile strength of SEBS/GO hybrid film samples with different
layers of GO. (d) Tensile strength of MA-g-SEBS/GO
hybrid film samples with different layers of GO.

The stress–strain curves of the pure SEBS film and
SEBS/GO
hybrid film with four resin layers and three GO layers are shown in Figure 3a, from which we
can see that compared with the pure SEBS film with the fracture stress
of 37 MPa and the elongation of 626% at break, the two tensile properties
indexes of SEBS/GO film are markedly improved, reaching 58 MPa and
796%, respectively. Tensile tests of SEBS/GO hybrid film samples with
different layers of GO were carried out, and the results are exhibited
in Figure 3c, from
which we can see that with the increase of GO layers, the fracture
stress of the SEBS/GO hybrid film is enhanced first, and when the
number of the GO layer reaches three, the value of the fracture stress
tends to be constant. The stress–strain curves of the pure
MA-g-SEBS film and MA-g-SEBS/GO
hybrid film with four resin layers and three GO layers are shown in Figure 3b. Tensile strength
of MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film samples with different
layers of GO is shown in Figure 3d. From the tensile test results of the MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film in Figure 3b,d, we do not see the properties of the
MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film were enhanced as expected.

Besides, from Figure 3, it can be seen that in comparison with the MA-g-SEBS-based hybrid films with the fracture stress of less than 10
MPa, the fracture stress of the SEBS-based hybrid films is far higher
than that of the MA-g-SEBS-based hybrid films with
the fracture stress of more than 10 MPa.

Surface profiler and
AFM were used to observe the morphology of
the interface in order to find out the key to the 58% enhancement
of fracture stress and 27% improvement of elongation at break for
SEBS-based hybrid films and the constant fracture stress and elongation
at break for MA-g-SEBS-based hybrid films. Figure 4 shows the macroscopic
surface morphology of SEBS, SEBS/GO, MA-g-SEBS, and
MA-g-SEBS/GO in a string of line, emerging like successive
peaks and valleys; therefore, the height of peaks (h, Å) and
the distance between them (l, μm) can be used to represent the
macroscopic roughness of the surface.

Figure 4 (a) Surface roughness of SEBS and SEBS/GO
films and (b) MA-g-SEBS and MA-g-SEBS/GO films measured
by a profile meter.

From Figure 4a,
we can see that the surface morphology of the SEBS changed little
after incorporation of GO, with the average height of the peaks increases
slightly from 17.0 to 18.4 nm, and the average distance decreases
a bit from 2.50 to 2.27 μm. While the AFM image in Figure 5a,b exhibits a considerable
increase of Ra from 0.781 to 1.458 nm.
Both the alteration of surface roughness can be explained by the reactive
inertness of SEBS polymer chains, and the mechanism is briefly explicated
in Figure 6. Due to
the lack of functional groups, not enough interfacial interaction
exists to make the GO platelets stack closely to the SEBS resin, so
that the platelets distribute onto the resin surface randomly, and
only few of them parallels to the surface. On one hand, the general
morphology changed little. On the other hand, the loose stack of wrinkled
GO platelets gives rise to the formation of interlocks between the
platelets and resin, which is in favor of taking advantage of the
super mechanical properties of GO to make the hybrid film stronger
and tougher.

(c) MA-g-SEBS, and (d) MA-g-SEBS/GO
films.

and (b) MA-g-SEBS/GO films.

For the constant stress of the MA-g-SEBS/GO
films,
strangely but interestingly, the phenomenon also can be explained
reasonably through the careful observation of the interface of the
composites. Figures 4b and 5c,d exhibit macroscopic and microscopic
surface roughness alteration, respectively. After incorporation of
GO, the surface roughness decreases obviously. As to macroscopic surface
roughness, the average height of the peaks goes down from 17.7 to
14.0 nm, and the distance between them narrows down from 2.91 to 1.83
μm. This may be attributed to the chemical interfacial interaction
between the resin and GO platelets, which induces the GO platelets
to align parallel to the resin surface. Therefore, the valleys are
likely to be filled by the GO platelets, resulting in the decrease
of the macroscopic surface roughness. In the meanwhile, close stack
between the GO platelets and resin makes the interface smoother, so
interlocks within the interface are unlikely to form. As a result,
the GO platelets and the resin tend to slide apart under tensile force,
without making full and best use of the ultrahigh mechanical properties
of GO. Even if there exist chemical bonds within the interface, the
lack of interlocks plays a leading role to the disadvantage of the
mechanical properties of MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid films.
Schematic image of the mechanism is shown in Figure 6. Of course, after the graphene sheets were
highly oxidized, the chemical interface interaction was strong enough
to prevent the slide of GO nanosheets under tension, leading to a
slight increase of the mechanical property of the MA-g-SEBS/GO film (Table S1).

Besides,
dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA) is indirectly
utilized to illustrate the effect of the super mechanical properties
of GO on the improvement of the hybrid SEBS/GO films, as shown in Figure 7. It is obvious that
the introduction of the GO endows the SEBS films with the improved
mechanical properties in Figure 7b (the E′ of the SEBS/GO films
is higher than the E′ of the SEBS films, especially
in the temperature range below 0 °C). From the results of the
dissipation factor (tan δ) characterization in Figure 7a, a distinct difference can
be seen with the greater tan δ value of the SEBS/GO films in
comparison with that of the SEBS films, indicating that there is better
load dissipation capacity for the SEBS/GO films. This better load
dissipation capacity is very useful for the loaded materials, effectively
dispersing energy and preventing the target materials from breaking.
That is to say that compared with the SEBS films, the SEBS/GO films
show better mechanical performance, and this result is in accordance
with Figure 3.

Figure 7 Hybrid films
with four resin layers and three GO layers for the
DMA test. (a) tan δ of SEBS and SEBS/GO films; (b) E′ of SEBS and SEBS/GO films.

The tan δ−T curves of the SEBS/GO hybrid films
with
different GO layers are all shown in Figure 8. The −50 °C is the Tg of the EB segment in the copolymer SEBS, and after the
introduction of GO, there is no apparent change for the Tg of the EB segment in the copolymer SEBS with different
GO layers. It is attributed to the absence of chemical reaction or
hydrogen bonding effect between the SEBS resin and GO sheet. Hence,
the intermolecular force of the EB segment in the copolymer SEBS is
not enhanced, leading to the constant Tg of the EB segment. This also illustrates the absence of the chemical
interfacial effect between the SEBS resin and GO sheet.

Figure 8 Effects of
temperature on tan δ of SEBS/GO hybrid film samples
with different layers of GO: (a) −100–120 °C; (b)
−70 to −25 °C.

Similarly, dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA) is also
utilized
to demonstrate the effect of the super mechanical properties of GO
on the improvement of the hybrid MA-g-SEBS/GO films,
as shown in Figure 9. As can be seen from the Figure 9, we do not see the properties of the MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film were enhanced as expected, and this result is
also consistent with the stress–strain curve of MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid films in Figure 3.

Figure 9 Hybrid films with four resin layers and three
GO layers for the
DMA test. (a) tan δ of MA-g-SEBS and MA-g-SEBS/GO films; (b) E′ of MA-g-SEBS and MA-g-SEBS/GO films.

The tan δ−T curves of the MA-g-SEBS/GO
hybrid films with different GO layers are shown in Figure 10. As can be seen from the
figure, with the introduction of more GO layers, the Tg of the EB segment in the copolymer MA-g-SEBS/GO increases from −64 to −52 °C. This is
ascribed to the esterification reaction between the modified MA-g-SEBS resin and GO sheets, leading to stronger intermolecular
forces of the EB segment. The stronger intermolecular force makes
the motion of the EB segment more difficult, giving rise to the increase
of Tg of the EB segment. This also illustrates
that there exists chemical interfacial effect between the MA-g-SEBS resin and GO sheets.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have studied
the effect of both physical and chemical
interfacial interactions on the static and dynamic mechanical properties
(DMA) between the GO and two kinds of SBC resins through the systematic
investigations of the morphology observation of the interfaces. After
incorporation of GO, mechanical properties of the SEBS/GO hybrid film
markedly improved, with the fracture stress reaching 58 MPa and elongation
at break increasing to 796%, which was attributed to the interlocks
formed between the resin and GO layers. However, it is interesting
that the property of the MA-g-SEBS/GO hybrid film
was not improved as expected because of the decrease of interface
roughness and the weakening of the physical interaction, even though
the esterification reaction could take place between maleic anhydride
groups of the MA-g-SEBS resin and the hydroxyl groups
of GO. Therefore, we draw the conclusion that with regard to SBC/GO
LBL assembled composites, the physical interfacial interaction plays
a more important role than the chemical interfacial interaction in
enhancing the mechanical properties. The synergistic effect of interlocks
within the interface is significant for the improvement of composites,
especially for those which expect dramatic enhancement from low content
addition of fillers such as GO and graphene. Moreover, we believe
that the conclusion is not only applicable to LBL assembled hybrid
composites but also of considerable reference value for extensive
composites incorporated with sheet-shaped or particle-shaped fillers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Graphite
with an average
particle size of 800 mesh and a purity of >99% were supplied from
Aladdin Industrial Corporation (Shanghai). SEBS (FG1650M) and MA-g-SEBS (FG1901X) with 1.0–1.7 wt % MA were purchased
from Kraton Performance Polymer Inc. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.

4.2 Preparation of GO
Graphene oxide
was prepared with Hummers’ method.39 Natural graphite (3 g) and concentrated H2SO4 (69 mL) were added into a three-neck flask and stirred in an ice
bath until the temperature dropped to 0–4 °C, then KMnO4 (18 g) was slowly added into the flask to keep the temperature
below 20 °C. After stirring for 2 h, the solution was heated
to 35 ± 3 °C and maintained for 45 min. Then, deionized
water (145 mL) was added into the flask very slowly with the temperature
below 70 °C, followed by heating the solution to 95 ± 3
°C and maintaining for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by
adding deionized water (350 mL) and H2O2 (20
mL). The mixture was washed successively with 10% HCl aqueous solution
and deionized water until the pH was nearly neutral. At last, GO was
obtained after vacuum drying.

4.3 Fabrication
of LBL Assembled Hybrid Film
SEBS and MA-g-SEBS solution used for LBL assembly
were prepared by dissolving 20 g resin into 100 mL of THF. GO was
dispersed into DMF with the concentration of 5 mg/mL, emerging yellow-brown
suspension after sonication. First, the resin was coated onto a glass
slide using the wet coating technique that has been widely applied
in industry and dried in an oven to form a thin layer of resin. Second,
the GO suspension was spread over the surface of deionized water drop
by drop gradually until the GO platelets covered the entire surface,
followed by sonication to form an ultrathin layer of GO, which was
adsorbed at air–water interface with highly oriented two-dimensional
(2D) structure.40 Then, the GO layer was
transferred onto the glass slide with a resin layer by dip-coating.
After slight rinse with deionized water, the glass slide was dried
in an oven to finish the second step. Alternate repetition of the
two steps above was conducted to fabricate hybrid films with the structure
of sandwich, the top and bottom of which were resin layers. Hybrid
films containing 0/1/3/5/7 layers of GO were fabricated with SEBS
and MA-g-SEBS resins. By tuning the resin layers,
the thickness of each film was controlled almost the same, about 100
μm.

4.4 Characterization
The Fourier transformed
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) test of SEBS, MA-g-SEBS,
and their nanocomposites were conducted on a Perkin-Elmer 1000 FTIR
spectrometer. Raman spectra were measured on a ThermoFisher/DXR. The
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement was carried out on a Rigaku D/Max
2550 (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å) with a 2θ scan configuration
in the range of 5°–40°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) experiment was performed on a Shimadzu-Kratos (AXIS Ultra).
Typical tapping-mode atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were
taken on a SIINT NanoNavi E-Sweep, with which not only the single-layer
GO platelets were observed but also the microscopic surface roughness
of the hybrid films was measured. Macroscopic surface roughness of
the films was obtained from a Bruker DektakXT Surface Profiler. The
sandwich structure of the LBL assembled films was observed using a
JEOL JSM-7401F scanning electron microscope at an acceleration voltage
of 5 kV, and all the samples were fractured after immersion in liquid
nitrogen for a few minutes. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was
carried out using a NETZSCH DMA 242 C/1/G instrument. The tensile
tests were conducted on a MTS Criterion Model 43 universal testing
machine, with a crosshead speed of 500 mm/min at the temperature of
25 °C.
