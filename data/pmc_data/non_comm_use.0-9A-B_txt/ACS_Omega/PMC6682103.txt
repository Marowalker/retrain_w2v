Dry
coal beneficiation has played a vital role during the initial
stage of coal cleaning in recent years. Successful utilization of
a gas–solid fluidized bed for >6 mm coal cleaning motivates
scholars to explore the possibility of fine coal cleaning using dry
beneficiation methods. In this study, pulsed flow was introduced into
a fluidized bed to optimize bubble behavior, thus improving the density
stability. The equation of minimum fluidization velocity (Umfp) in a gas-vibro fluidized bed for coal preparation
was investigated theoretically. An equation has been proposed for
predicting Umfp while considering changes
in the friction coefficient (Cf) in the
gas-vibro fluidized bed. Based on two-phase theory, the correlation
of bed density was determined by analyzing the bubble behavior in
the gas-vibro fluidized bed. The theoretical bed density was then
compared with experimental data of the bed density and separation
density. The predicted bed density in monodisperse and binary dense
medium systems was found to be consistent with the experimental results.
Overall, the equation of bed density is suitable for estimating the
separation density in the gas-vibro fluidized bed.

1 Introduction
Coal is the largest energy resource in China, accounting for about
63% of total energy consumption in 2017.1 It is noted that combustion of raw coal generally produces amount
of ash, which causes serious air pollution, e.g., fog and haze. Coal
beneficiation technologies are commonly used to remove gangue during
the initial stage of coal cleaning. Traditionally, coal and gangue
are often segregated, depending on the difference in their densities,
surface properties, and dielectric constants.2 Gravity methods, such as cyclone and dense medium separation system,
still play a crucial role in coal cleaning.3−6 However, water shortage is an
important problem in the western arid regions of China. In addition,
investments are another factor for consideration when evaluating the
technical feasibility. Thus, dry beneficiation methods have drawn
the scholars’ attention in recent years because of the advantages
of no water consumption and lower investments. At present, different
technologies have been put into production in the industry.7,8 An air-jig separator, FGX separator, and air dense medium fluidized
bed (ADMFB) are representative beneficiation technologies. It is worth
noting that the separation principles of air-jig and FGX separators
are primarily based on differences in the settling velocity of coal
and gangue.9,10 It is noticeable that the settling
velocity is directly related to the particle size and density. It
is difficult to remove gangue if coal and gangue have the same settling
velocity. ADMFB primarily relies on the bed density for segregation
of coal and gangue. In the separation procedure, magnetite powder
is suspended by gas in the bed and the fluidized bed has pseudofluid
properties with stable density. The gangue density is higher than
the bed density; thus, gangue sinks to the bottom of the bed while
coal floats to the surface.11−14 In recent years, ADMFB has been used for >6 mm
coal
separation on an industrial scale.15

The successful use of ADMFB for >6 mm coal separation motivates
scholars to explore its possible use for fine coal separation with
dry beneficiation methods. Because additional energy can reduce the
bubble size and increase the bubble residence time in the fluidized
bed, the bed density fluctuation decreases significantly. Other scholars
have attempted to introduce additional energy, such as vibration and
pulsed flow energy, into the bed to optimize bubble behavior and improve
density stability.16−20 It is important to point out that the gas-vibro fluidized bed was
widely studied in recent years, including its separation mechanism,
density distribution, separation theory, and its use for fine coal
separation. However, many density models are mainly based on the empirical
methods through the separation experiments. A few studies have been
conducted on the theoretical analysis of bed density in a gas-vibro
fluidized bed. Compared to the previous models, the density model
based on the two-phase theory can generally predict the bed density
well in the fluidized bed. Therefore, minimum fluidization velocity
and the fluid mechanics in the gas-vibro fluidized bed were initially
investigated in this study. The equation of the minimum fluidization
velocity was also proposed by analyzing the relationship between the
friction coefficient (Cf) and the frequency
of gas flow. During the second stage, the theoretical bed density
models were put forward depending on the two-phase theory in a gas-vibro
fluidized bed. The theoretical density was then compared with experimental
data on the bed density and separation density to verify the accuracy
of the model.

2 Experimental System and Materials
2.1 Experimental Apparatus
Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus
of the gas-vibro fluidized bed. The apparatus includes a gas supply
system, a gas flow control system, a pulsed flow generator system,
a fluidized bed separator, feedstock, and a data acquisition system.
The fluidized bed system includes an air chamber, a distributor, and
a cylindrical column. The pore size of the distributor is 5 mm, and
the cylindrical column is made of organic glass with 120 mm inner
diameter and 400 mm height. Pulsed gas flow was provided by installing
a butterfly valve driven by an electric motor, and an inverter was
used to control the speed of the motor corresponding to the pulsed
frequency of gas flow. A pressure transducer was used to measure the
pressure drop in the fluidized bed. During the separation process,
fine magnetite powder, coal powder, and quartz sand powder were used
as dense medium in the fluidized bed. Raw coal was then placed in
the fluidized bed from feedstock. Coal with lower density floats to
the surface, while gangue with a higher density sinks to the bottom.

2.2 Dense Medium and Coal Sample Properties
Because magnetite powder can be easily recovered and reused, it
is primarily used for coal beneficiation in the gas-vibro fluidized
bed. The bed density normally ranges from 1.8 to 2.3 g/cm3 if magnetite powder is used as the dense medium. As shown in Figure 2, due to the high
bed density in a monodisperse particle system, it is necessary to
investigate a method for decreasing separation density in the gas-vibro
fluidized bed. Traditionally, a mixture of binary particle is an effective
method to decrease the separation density and broaden the range of
density adjustment. As shown in Table 1, magnetite powder, fine coal, and quartz sand powder
were used to investigate the fluidization characteristics and conduct
separation experiments in the gas-vibro fluidized bed. One should
note that magnetite powders with average sizes of 232 and 110 μm
were used to investigate the fluidization characteristics in a single
dense medium system. The mixture of magnetite powder and fine coal
powder or quartz sand powder were used to study the fluidization behavior
in a binary dense medium system. To apply fluidization theory in the
binary particle systems, it is important to define the particle diameter
and density of the binary particles. In this study, an effective density
and effective diameter of mixture are defined as21 1   2  where
ρ̅ is the equivalent density
of binary particles, w1 and w2 are the proportions of each type of particle, and d̅ is equivalent diameter of the binary particles.

In this study, a −6 + 3 mm
coal sample from Xinjiang, China
was used for separation experiments. Table 2 shows the density distribution and ash content,
which were determined through float-and-sink experiments. The ash
content exhibits an increasing tendency as the density increases,
and the average content of raw coal is 25.13%. Meanwhile, the average
ash content of coal with −1.6 g/cm3 is 4.30%. In
addition, coal with a density of −1.6 g/cm3 accounts
for the highest proportion, 72.53% of all samples. The aim of coal
separation is to decrease the ash content to about 5%, while
the separation density should be maintained near 1.6 g/cm3. Therefore, we also attempted to explore the possibility of separation
at a lower density in the gas-vibro fluidized bed.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Minimum Fluidization Velocity in the Gas-Vibro
Fluidized Bed
The minimum fluidization velocity (Umf) is a crucial parameter for identifying the
transition from a fixed bed to a fluidized bed. When the gas velocity U < Umf, the particles are
in a quiescent state and the pressure drop increases linearly as the
gas velocity increases. In contrast, the particles are suspended in
the gas, the pressure drop remains constant, and the bed enters a
fluidized state when U > Umf. In a laboratory scale, experimental methods are used to
determine Umf using pressure drop and
gas velocity data.
However, one should note that exploring Umf on an industrial scale using experimental methods is difficult due
to difficulty in data collection. Thus, theoretical analysis is necessary
to determine correlations in the experimental data when predicting Umf. In a traditional gas–solid fluidized
bed, researchers consider particles in the fluidized bed like an inclined
pipe.22 Through an analysis of the relationship
between the friction coefficient (Cf)
and Reynolds number (Re), the pressure drop (ΔP) in a fluidized bed can be described as shown in eq 3 3  where μ
is the gas viscosity, L is the height of particles
in the bed, d is the particle size, U is the gas velocity, ε
is the particle voidage, and λ is a constant.

Carman considered
λ = 180 in a traditional fluidized bed.23 However, Ergun proposed that Cf in eq 3 can be used to calculate
ΔP at lower Re values and
modified the friction coefficient is as follows24 4  Thus, ΔP in a fluidized
bed becomes 5  The gravity and drag are
balanced when U = Umf, namely, the weight
of particles is equal to the pressure drop in the fluidized bed, as
shown in eq 6 6  where ρs is the particle
density, εmf is the particle voidage in the minimum
fluidization state, and g is the gravitational acceleration.
Therefore, Umf can be calculated by combining eqs 3 and 6, or eqs 5 and 6.

Compared to a traditional fluidized bed,
a gas-vibro fluidized
bed relies on variations in gas flow to encourage gas vibration, which
produces variations in Cf. It was found
in previous studies that Umf varies with
different gas pulse frequencies in the fluidized bed.20 Traditional equations of Umf do not work well in a gas-vibro fluidized bed. It is necessary to
determine a new equation of Umf in a gas-vibro
fluidized bed. For particles in a gas-vibro fluidized bed, the force
balance is defined as 7  where FD is the
drag force and Fm is the weight of the
particles. Kozeny’s method can be used at lower Re to simplify Cf in a gas-vibro fluidized
bed. Thus, combining eqs 3, 6, and 7 yields 8  where Umfp is
the minimum fluidization velocity in the gas-vibro fluidized bed.

Due to disturbances in the pulsed gas flow, λ is directly
related to the frequency of the pulsed gas flow as follows 9  Thus, eq 8 can written
as follows 10  Finally, Umfp can
be written as follows 11  Table 3 shows detailed information about Umfp with different particles and λ at
different gas pulsed frequencies. Figure 3 shows a curve for
fitting the value of k(f), where
the equation is defined as 12  One should notice that λ is about 180,
as proposed by Carman,23 when the gas pulse
frequency is 0. Meanwhile, values of λ are similar at the same
gas pulse frequency, proving the credibility of the assumption of
λ in the gas-vibro fluidized bed. Meanwhile, error analysis
yields an overall R2 value of 80.65% compared
with the experimental data, showing higher precision in the gas-vibro
fluidized bed. Based on theoretical Cf values, experimental data on Umfp were
compared with theoretical Umfp values,
as shown in Figure 4. The results show that the predicted minimum gas velocities are
consistent with the experimental data, with a relative deviation of
less than 10%. This means that the new equation of Umfp is consistent with the experimental data. Therefore,
equations of Umfp are suitable for predicting
the minimum gas fluidization velocity in a gas-vibro fluidized bed
when considering pulsed gas flow. Meanwhile, the new equation has
wide applications, which can be accurately used to predict Umfp for monodisperse and binary particle systems.

3.2 Estimation
of Bed Density Based on Two-Phase
Theory in the Gas-Vibro Fluidized Bed
Traditionally, for
Geldart B particles, bubbles begin to arise in the fluidized bed when U > Umf. Two phases (bubble
phase and emulsion phase) appear in the fluidized bed simultaneously,25 as shown in Figure 5. Generally, it is considered that bubbles
carry extra gas away from the bed. Thus, the bubble phase volume can
be described as follows 13  where Q is the extra gas
flow, A is the cross-sectional area of the fluidized
bed, and ΔU is the extra gas velocity. The
bubble holdup at one certain bed height can calculated using eq 14 14  Thus, the bed height occupied by bubbles is 15  The total bed height is 16  When the bubbles are stable and Ub exhibits
little variation at a certain height, eq 16 simply becomes 17  In the gas-vibro fluidized bed, the bubble
size and diameter are important parameters for understanding the distribution
of the bubble and emulsion phases. Many researchers experimentally
investigated the bubble behavior in gas-vibro fluidized beds.26−31Regarding the bubble size, Sobrino et al. and Dong et al. observed
the variation of bubble size in gas-vibro fluidized beds and found
some difference in the bubble size between a traditional fluidized
bed and a gas-vibro fluidized bed.26,27 In addition,
Sobrino et al. proposed the bubble size equation in the gas-vibro
fluidized bed26 18  where rbd is the
initial bubble radius, A0 is cross-sectional
area per hole in the distributor, and ω is the angular velocity
of the butterfly valve.

Figure 5 Schematic diagram of two-phase theory of fluidization.

Thus, the bubble diameter becomes 19  For estimating the bubble size, Bizhaem et al. attempted to use Mori and Wen’s bubble
size equations in a gas-vibro fluidized bed.31,32 The equations can be described as follows 20   21  where deq,m is
the maximum equivalent bubble diameter of a bubble and D is the fluidized bed diameter.

Regarding the bubble size,
Köksal et al. found that the
bubble velocity in a gas-vibro fluidized bed is lower than that in
a traditional fluidized bed,29 which increases
the bubble residence time and bed expansion in a gas-vibro fluidized
bed. The equations can be described as follows 22  The
total bed height is 23  Thus, average bubble holdup, , can be calculated as 24  The bed density in a fluidized bed at a given
height is 25  Thus, combining eq 24 with eq 25, the bed
density in a fluidized bed at a given height
is 26  For high-density separation of coal
in a gas-vibro
fluidized bed, magnetite powder is only used as the dense medium with
the separation density ranging from approximately 1.8 to 2.2 g/cm3. In this study, 232 and 110 μm magnetite powders were
chosen for density analysis. Dong previously used the 232 μm
magnetite powder and reported the effect of the gas pulse frequency
on density variations at a fluidization number, N, of 1.2.20 Thus, for the former particles,
data were collected from the previous study for comparison. For the
110 μm magnetite powder, the bed density was analyzed at different
pulse frequencies and gas velocities. As shown in Figures 6 and 7, experimental data for the 110 and 232 μm magnetite powders
were compared with the theoretical value calculated by eq 26 in the fluidized bed, respectively.
One should note that the error between the theoretical density and
the experiment data are approximately ±0.1 g/cm3,
which meets the required density prediction accuracy in an industrial
process. Thus, the equation can be used to estimate the density in
monodispersed particle systems. The small difference may arise due
to errors in estimating the bubble behavior and gas exchange between
the emulsion and bubble phases.

powder (110 μm).

Figure 7 Prediction for the bed density of magnetite powder (232 μm).

For a binary particle system in
a gas-vibro fluidized bed, magnetite
powder (110 μm) was mixed with fine coal (400 μm) and
quartz sand (250 μm). Figures 8 and 9 show that the theoretical
bed density calculated with eq 26 is consistent with the experimental data in a binary particle
system. In most cases, the error between the theoretical density and
experimental data are within ±0.1 g/cm3, which shows
that the bed density model provides very accurate density predictions
in a binary particle system. Therefore, the equation can also be used
to estimate the bed density in a binary particle system.

(110 μm) and 40% quartz sand (250 μm).

Figure 9 Prediction for the bed density of mixture of magnetite
powder (110
μm) and 10% fine coal (400 μm).

Figure 10 shows
the error between the experimental data and predicted values. The
relative deviation between the theoretical and experimental data is
within ±10%. It is worth noting that better agreement can be
found between the calculated and experimental values with a relative
deviation of less than 15%. Thus, the theoretical bed density determined
from two-phase theory is consistent with the experimental data. Based
on the above analysis, the proposed equation is suitable for predicting
the bed density in the gas-vibro fluidized bed.

3.3 Comparison between Bed Density and Separation
Density
Traditionally, the bed density can be measured with
pressure transducers and calculated by analyzing the distribution
of the bubble and dense phase in the fluidized bed. The separation
density is determined through coal beneficiation experiments. Because
the bubble behavior or dense medium can affect the coal movement,
the separation density may be slightly different from the bed density.
To analyze the relation between the bed density and separation density,
fine coal separation experiments must be conducted to explore the
reliability of eq 26. At present, much work on coal separation using a high-density gas-vibro
fluidized bed has been conducted.18−20,27,30 Separation density data were
collected for comparison. For low-density separation of fine coal,
magnetite powder (110 μm) and quartz sand (200 μm, 40%)
were mixed to decrease the separation density in the study.

A partition curve is often used to analyze the separation density
in an industrial process during actual coal separation experiments.15,17,20 The X-coordinate
is the density and the Y-coordinate is the mass fraction
of the misplaced coal, whose density is lower than the density corresponding
to the X-coordinate value. The partition coefficient,
δ50, refers to the separation density when the partition
coefficient is 50%. Figures 11 and 12 show the separation density
at different gas velocities and gas pulse frequencies. The results
show that the separation densities are approximately 1.6 g/cm3, which are very close to the theoretical bed density in the
gas-vibro fluidized bed.

Figure 11 Separation results at different gas velocities.

Figure 12 Separation results at different frequencies
of pulsed gas flow.

The separation densities
from many publications were then collected
for comparison with the theoretical bed density determined using the
above equations, as shown in Table 4. The error between the separation densities and theoretical
values is compared in Figure 13. It is worth noting that the predicted bed densities are
consistent with the experimental data with a relative deviation of
less than 10%. In addition, fairly better agreement can be found between
the calculated and experimental values with a relative deviation of
less than 15%. The agreement between the experimental and predicted
values further illustrates the reliability of the predicted density.
Based on above analysis, the theoretical bed density based on the
two-phase theory can be used to predict the separation density in
a gas-vibro fluidized bed.

A theoretical analysis of the minimum fluidization velocity and
bed density is necessary to establish relative equations. It is noted
that the gas pulse frequency influences Umfp. An equation for predicting Umfp that
considers changes in the friction coefficient (Cf) in the gas-vibro fluidized bed has been proposed. The predicted
minimum gas velocities are consistent with the experimental data with
a relative deviation of less than 10%. The bed density was defined
in terms of the bubble size and velocity in the gas-vibro fluidized
bed based on the two-phase theory. Compared with the experimental
bed density, prediction density errors are less than 0.10 g/cm3 in major situations, which illustrates accurate bed density
prediction in monodisperse and binary particle systems. Compared with
the separation density, the theoretical values are consistent with
the experimental data with a relative deviation of less than 15%,
illustrating the reliability of the theoretical density. Thus, the
predicted bed density determined from two-phase theory can be used
for predicting the separation density in a gas-vibro fluidized bed.
