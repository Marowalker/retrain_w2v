A multifunctional
nanosystem was synthesized to be used as a dual
sensor of UV light and temperature. NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) were synthesized
and coated with a silica shell to which a europium(III) complex was
incorporated. The synthesis of NaGdF4 UCNPs was performed
via thermal decomposition of lanthanide ion fluoride precursors in
the presence of oleic acid. To achieve sufficient water dispersibility,
the surface of the hydrophobic oleate-capped UCNPs in the hexagonal
phase was modified by a silica coating through a modified Stöber
process through a reverse microemulsion method. An Eu(tta)3 (tta: thenoyltrifluoroacetonate) complex was prepared in situ at
the silica shell. A dual-mode nanothermometer was obtained from a
near infrared to visible upconversion fluorescence signal of Er3+ ions together with UV-excited downshifting emission from
the Eu3+ complex. Measurements were recorded near the physiological
temperature range (293–323 K), revealing excellent linearity
(R2 > 0.99) and relatively high thermal
sensitivities (≥1.5%·K–1). The Eu(tta)3 complex present in the silica shell was tested as the UV
sensor because of the Eu3+ luminescence dependence on UV-light
exposure time.

1 Introduction
The rapid advance in nanotechnology
has enabled the development
of materials that integrate multiple functions, each one related to
their components that act synergistically. A large number of composite
nanomaterials have been created, which exhibit excellent chemical,
physical, and biological properties with strong potential in biomedicine,1 catalysis,2 sensors,3 energy conversion,4 and so forth. Incorporation of luminescent species in such materials
gives rise to additional applications in photonics, medicine, sensing,
and imaging as well. In fact, lanthanide-based materials possess special
luminescence properties such as narrow photoluminescence peaks, tunable
photostability, relatively high emission quantum yields, and emission
lines spanning the electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to
the infrared region, allowing high-technology applications.5−8

One interesting application of the luminescent properties
of lanthanide
ions consists of thermometry on the nanoscale because of a strongly
temperature-dependent effect.9−11 Temperature is a fundamental
variable that governs diverse intracellular chemical and physical
interactions in the life cycle of biological cells.12 Measuring the temperature of cancer cells at the cellular
level, for example, allows the optimization of therapeutic processes
(e.g., hyperthermal tumor treatment).13,14 Another current
interest in nanothermometry is monitoring temperature in micro- or
nanoelectronics “hot spots”.15,16 Fundamental properties such as the instantaneous ballistic velocity
of suspended Brownian nanocrystals have been measured with nanothermometers
as well.17 Temperature variations may induce
different effects on the luminescence of lanthanides, including (i)
redistribution of the electronic state population due to Boltzmann
statistics, (ii) quenching mechanisms that result in decreasing emission
intensity, and (iii) nonradiative transition because of electron–phonon
interactions.18

Several dopant ions have been used in
lanthanide-based thermometers.
Er3+-containing materials present a strong temperature
dependence on the relative intensity of its two green luminescence
bands. This effect is associated with the thermal equilibrium in the
population of excited states 2H11/2 and 4S3/2.19 An interesting
point relates to the fact that the green emission can be observed
with excitation either in the UV or in the infrared region. In the
latter case, the so-called upconversion emission is treated. It is
a well-known feature observed for many different lanthanide ions,
being used in several different fields.20−22 Concerning the UV-excited
downshifting emission of Eu3+ complexes with organic ligands,
a temperature probe with a highly temperature-dependent emission is
related to the thermal deactivation of the 5D0 excited state.23−26 Eu3+ complexes may also present an additional issue that
is related to their reduced photostability under UV irradiation. Because
UV light detection is of great interest in environmental and biological
fields, among others, the low photostability may be well explored
for UV dose sensing.27−34 Therefore, dual-modal temperature sensors may be obtained from two
active centers with different temperature-sensitive luminescence features.
Such thermometers may combine two lanthanide ions.35−37 The second
probe may be an organic dye,38 a quantum
dot,39 or a transition metal ion.40−46

Lanthanide-based upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are a
promising
solution for biological systems as they can be excited in the near
infrared (NIR) region within the biological transparency window and
emit NIR photons or higher energy (visible) photons. High penetration
depths and low autofluorescence are some of the unique advantages
related to the use of low-energy NIR excitation photons compared with
conventional luminescent nanomaterials, such as organic dyes and quantum
dots, which require an excitation source in the UV–visible
region.47

This work proposes a multifunctional
nanoplatform that combines
two independent luminescent probes. NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+@SiO2–Eu(tta)3 nanoparticles
were prepared as a temperature sensor in the vicinity of the biological
range (293–323 K) and a UV-light detector.

2 Methods
2.1 Materials
Lanthanide oxides (gadolinium
oxide, ytterbium oxide, and erbium oxide), europium(III) chloride
hexahydrate, trifluoroacetic acid, sodium trifluoroacetate, oleic
acid, 1-octadecene, IGEPAL CO-520, ammonium hydroxide (28–30%),
tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta)
were all purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA).

2.2 Synthesis of Yb3+/Er3+ Co-Doped
NaGdF4 UCNPs
The synthesis of colloidal
NaGdF4 upconverting nanoparticles doped with the ions Yb3+/Er3+ was performed via thermal decomposition
of fluoride precursors of lanthanide ions. The method described previously
by Hemmer et al.48 is a two-pot synthesis.
In the first step of the synthesis, the lanthanide trifluoroacetate
precursor was prepared. A 10 mL mixture of trifluoroacetic acid and
water (1:1) was added to a 50 mL three-neck round bottom flask containing
gadolinium oxide (353.4 mg, 0.975 mmol), ytterbium oxide (98.5 mg,
0.250 mmol), and erbium oxide (9.6 mg, 0.025 mmol) to obtain a molar
ratio of Gd:Yb:Er = 78:20:2. The solution was refluxed at 353 K for
12 h until a clear solution was obtained. The temperature was then
lowered to 333 K, and the flask was opened to let water and trifluoroacetic
acid evaporate to dryness for 5 h. In the second step, 340 mg of sodium
trifluoroacetate was added to the flask in which the precursor lanthanide
trifluoroacetate was previously prepared, followed by the addition
of 7.5 mL each of oleic acid and 1-octadecene. In a second flask (a
three-neck round bottom flask of 100 mL), 12.5 mL each of oleic acid
and 1-octadecene were added. The flasks were connected to a Schlenk
line to remove moisture and oxygen for 30 min at 125 °C under
vacuum and magnetic stirring. Subsequently, the flask containing oleic
acid and 1-octadecene was heated to 583 K under argon flow at a heating
rate of 10 K/min. A few minutes after reaching this temperature, the
precursor solution at 398 K was collected with a glass syringe and
injected dropwise to the reaction vessel. A pump system was used at
an injection rate of 1.5 mL min–1. The solution
was maintained at 583 K for a further 60 min under stirring and argon
flow. After this period, the heating source was removed. When the
solution reached room temperature, the obtained nanoparticles were
precipitated by the addition of ethanol and centrifuged at 5350 RCF
for 10 min. The nanoparticles were washed twice by dispersing in hexane,
followed by precipitation with ethanol (1:5 v/v), and then recovered
using centrifugation. The resultant oleate-capped NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ nanoparticles were finally redispersed
in hexane for further characterizations.

2.3 Silica
Coating of NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ UCNPs
The obtained UCNPs were coated
with a silica shell using a reverse microemulsion method.49 First, 32 mg of UCNPs were dispersed in 10 mL
of cyclohexane, and then 0.4 g of the surfactant IGEPAL CO-520 was
added. After 10 min of stirring, 1.6 g of IGEPAL CO-520 and 80 μL
of ammonium hydroxide were added to form a water-in-oil microemulsion.
The emulsion was sonicated for 30 min. TEOS (40 μL) was then
added and the solution was stirred at 300 rpm for 48 h. The nanoparticles
were precipitated by adding acetone and washed twice with ethanol/water
(1:1). Centrifugation was performed to recover the particles at 1590
RCF for 20 min. The UCNP core–silica shell (UCNPs@SiO2) was finally stored in water.

2.4 Preparation
of NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+@SiO2–Eu(tta)3
First, europium was incorporated
in the silica shell by adding europium(III)
chloride hexahydrate solution in ethanol (1.5 mL, 20 mM) to UCNPs@SiO2 (10 mg). The mixture was placed in an ultrasonic bath for
1 h and then 24 h under stirring in a vortex mixer. The nanoparticles
were separated using centrifugation (1590 RCF/20 min). Afterward,
the ligand tta was added in a 3:1 molar ratio tta/Eu. An ethanolic
tta solution (1.5 mL, 60 mM) was added to the recovered particles
and then dispersed using ultrasound followed by the addition of ammonia
solution (75 μL). Stirring was continued for 24 h in a thermomixer
(Eppendorf) at 800 rpm and 281 K. The particles were centrifuged (1590
RCF/20 min) and washed once with ethanol and once with hexane and
finally suspended in ethanol (1.5 mL).

2.5 Characterization
A Tecnai G2 Spirit
BioTwin (120 kV) transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to
analyze the particle size and structural morphology. The crystal phase of the UCNPs was investigated by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) using a Siemens D5000 Kristalloflex diffractometer using nickel-filtered
Cu Kα radiation. The processing software was JADE version 2.1
coupled with the JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards)
database of ICDD (International Centre for Diffraction Data) 2001
version. UV-excited visible photoluminescence and NIR-excited upconversion
emission spectra were measured using a FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorimeter
(model 322) from HORIBA Jobin Yvon. A Xenon lamp and an external 980
nm continuous wave diode laser JDS Uniphase (model S26-7602-340) were
used as excitation sources. The excitation power densities at the
sample position were estimated by using a power meter (Newport 2935-C).
To obtain the thermal calibration curves, the emission spectra were
measured at different temperatures in a Peltier-based temperature-controlled
cuvette holder coupled to the fluorometer. A period of 10 min was
given to allow the temperature to stabilize. For upconversion emission
spectra measured at different temperatures, the laser power at the
sample position was 81 mW. The calibration measurements for the UV
light sensor were recorded at room temperature with a power density
of 1.35 mW/cm2.

3 Results
and Discussion
UCNPs were obtained as oleate-capped NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ via thermal decomposition
of lanthanide trifluoroacetate.
TEM images of NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ (Figure 1a) show that monodisperse
nanocrystals (size 26.2 ± 1.7 nm) with hexagon-shaped morphology
were obtained. The oleate-capped UCNPs are dispersible only in nonpolar
solvents, such as hexane. The surface modification by a silica coating
rendered the particles dispersible in water, which is important for
biological applications. Additionally, silica is known to be highly
stable, biocompatible, and optically transparent and to present abundant
Si–OH active bonds available for surface functionalization;
moreover, depending on the preparation method, high pore volumes may
be obtained where different species may be stored.50 TEM images of silica-coated UCNPs (Figure 1b) show a thin (approximately 7 nm thick)
and uniform silica shell at the nanocrystal surface. An XRD pattern
of oleate-capped NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ and their corresponding phase reference graph of NaGdF4 are presented in Figure 1c. The pattern is in accordance with the hexagonal phase (JCPDS
file 27-0699), which is well known for its higher upconversion efficiency
versus the cubic phase.51Figure 1d shows the upconversion emission
spectrum (λexc 980 nm) of silica-coated UCNPs in
water at two different temperatures (293 and 323 K). The bands observed
in the spectral regions of 510–536 and 536–575 nm correspond
to the Er3+ transitions 2H11/2 → 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, respectively. As the temperature increases,
the relative emission intensity at approximately 523 nm was observed
to increase with respect to the emission at 543 nm because of a thermally
driven population increase in the higher energy level (2H11/2), to the detriment of the lower energy level (4S3/2). This effect is in accordance with the Boltzmann
distribution as defined by eq 1 1  where FIR is the fluorescence intensity ratio
between the integrated intensities of the emission bands at 523 and
543 nm, represented by I523 and I543, respectively; C is a constant
that depends on the degeneracies and spontaneous emission rates of
the emitting states and photon energies; and ΔE is the energy gap between the two excited states.

Figure 2 shows
the
photoluminescence excitation spectrum (PLE—Figure 2a) and photoluminescence emission
spectrum (PL—Figure 2b) obtained for NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+@SiO2–Eu(tta)3 nanoparticles. Two spectra
of the well-known complex [Eu(tta)3(H2O)2] and the compound [Eu(tta)3–U] (U stands
for an ureasil organic–inorganic hybrid host) adapted from
Molina et al.52 are also shown for comparison
purposes. The broad excitation band (with maximum at 352 nm) covering the
region of the UV-A (400–315 nm) and UV-B (315–280 nm)
in PLE spectra accounts for the antenna effect because of the presence
of tta ligands. Similarities in spectra allow us to propose that the
Eu(tta)3 compound is formed at the silica nanoshell of
the new nanoparticles. As already mentioned, the strong UV absorption
cross section and efficient energy transfer make these Eu3+ complexes strong red light emitters. The well-known PL spectrum
obtained for [Eu(tta)3(H2O)2] shows
emission arising mainly from the Eu3+5D0 to the 7FJ manifold
(J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), with the 5D0 → 7F2 dominating the general intensity.
When incorporated either in the organic–inorganic hybrid studied
before or in the silica nanoshell of the present nanoparticles, broadening
is observed because of the inhomogeneous distribution of sites in
the two hosts.

spectra
for the complex [Eu(tta)3(H2O)2]
(black), the compound [Eu(tta)3–host] (red), and
UCNPs@SiO2–Eu(tta)3 (blue). Spectra of
[Eu(tta)3(H2O)2] and [Eu(tta)3–host] were adapted from Molina et al.52

The drawback that could hinder
the practical application of these
luminophores refers to low photostability of the β-diketonates
under UV light.27 However, one can take
in advantage that property that can be useful for application as a
sensor UV after exposure to sunlight.

Figure 3a shows
nanoparticle emission spectra obtained in the temperature range of
293–323 K under UV irradiation. The inset shows a photograph
of the cuvette under UV illumination. A decrease in the Eu3+ emission intensity is observed with the increase in temperature
because of a competition between emission and nonradiative energy
transfer from the Eu3+ ion to the ligand (Figure 3a). As mentioned in the Introduction, the utilization of the Eu3+/tta species in temperature measurements based on intensity changes
is well known.23−26Figure 3b shows the
upconversion spectra in the same temperature range. The inset shows
a photograph of the cuvette under 980 nm illumination. Here, again,
the temperature-dependent variation of the emission lines can clearly
be observed. Figure 3c,d show the linear correlations that can be obtained for both Eu3+ (λexc 352 nm, R2 = 0.99965) and Er3+ (λexc 980 nm, R2 = 0.99776) emission bands upon temperature
variations. The integration ranges used to compute the integrated
areas are 510–536 and 536–565 nm for Er3+ emissions and 603–643 nm for Eu3+ emission. For
each temperature, the average of five measurements were calculated;
the error bars in the plots represent standard deviation. A dual-mode
temperature sensor is therefore proposed here. The energy gap between
the 2H11/2 and 4S3/2 states
of Er3+ was estimated from the slope of Boltzmann plot
(Figure 3d), which
gives the parameter ΔE/kB (eq 1). The
value calculated from the slope (724 cm–1) is similar
to the energy difference between the barycenters of the emission bands
(694 cm–1) within the experimental resolution used
in obtaining the spectra (1 nm). This ΔE value
for Er3+ in different host materials ranges from 700 to
800 cm–1.14,53

K): under (a) UV and (b)
NIR excitation. Insets: Corresponding luminescent photographs. Thermal
calibration curves: (c) fluorescence intensity (integrated area) vs
temperature (λexc 352 nm) and (d) ln(FIR) vs inverse
temperature (λexc 980 nm).

The thermometric performance in the calibration temperature
range
was evaluated by analyzing several metric parameters. Table 1 presents the calibration parameters
of the dual-mode thermometer under UV and NIR excitation. The calibration
linearity was evaluated using the regression coefficient (R2), which was larger than 0.99. Temperature
uncertainty (∂T), the smallest temperature
change that can be detected in a given measurement, was determined
from temperature readouts performed at different reference temperatures
(displayed by the Peltier-based temperature controller). Temperature
values were calculated from the calibration curves. The standard deviation
of the resultant temperature is the experimental ∂T of the luminescent thermometer. Repeatability refers to the variability
between measurements. High repeatability was observed for both probes,
as the relative standard deviations (RSD) among measurements values
were found to be lower than 0.3%.

Thermometer under UV and NIR Excitations

slope	–2.15 × 105 (±1.65 × 103)	2.16 (±0.06)

repeatability (RSD)	0.32%	0.33%	
relative
sensitivity (Sr) at 303 K	2.67%·K–1	1.48%·K–1	
In addition, the accuracy was estimated to evaluate the performance
of the proposed nanothermometer. For each temperature, the average
value for five replicate measurements was calculated and then compared
with the reference temperature. The linear function between the real
and the calculated temperature revealed excellent linearity (R2 > 0.99), indicating the closeness between
the measured value and the true value.

The relative thermal
sensitivity (Sr) is the parameter that
describes the performance of a luminescent
thermometer and allows the comparison of different types of thermometers.9Sr gives the variation
of the experimental parameter (Q) per degree of temperature,
which corresponds to (i) the FIR, for the ratiometric thermometer
and (ii) the integrated intensity for the nonratiometric thermometer. Sr can be expressed as eq 2 2  Sr values were
estimated from the calibration data (Figure 3c,d). The relative sensitivity at 303 K was
2.67%·K–1 for the Eu3+ emission
and 1.48%·K–1 for the Er3+ emission.
Therefore, both techniques present high relative thermal sensitivities
(>1%·K–1).54

To further investigate the behavior of NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+@SiO2–Eu(tta)3 nanoparticles
under UV-light exposure (λ = 352 nm, with a
power density of 1.35 mW/cm2), emission spectra were measured
at room temperature (Figure 4a) and 980 nm after different periods of exposure to UV light.
The Eu3+ emission intensity at 615 nm (integrated area)
decay with exposure time is presented in Figure 4b. Er3+ emission intensities at
approximately 523 and 543 nm are also represented in Figure 4b. They remained constant,
showing that the upconversion thermometer was not affected by UV-light
irradiation. The ratio between the Eu3+ and Er3+ emission intensities presents an exponential decay (Figure 4b) with exposure time (R2 = 0.98294). The ratio of the Eu3+ downshifting emission intensity to the upconverted emission intensity
is therefore sensitive to the UV exposure dose.

(λexc 352 nm) of UCNPs@SiO2–Eu(tta)3 after different periods of exposure

(352 nm) and NIR (980 nm) excitation and fluorescence intensity ratio

solid line represents the exponential fit curve).

4 Conclusions
NaGdF4:Yb3+:Er3+ upconverting
nanocrystals were obtained in the hexagonal phase by using the thermal
decomposition method. The hydrophobic oleate-capped nanocrystals were
coated with a thin silica shell through a reverse microemulsion route
to achieve water dispersibility. The silica shell was also useful
as a matrix for the incorporation of the europium(III)–tta
complex. Thermal dependences of the Eu3+ and Er3+ luminescence were investigated under ultraviolet and infrared excitations.
The optical thermometers so obtained presented suitable properties
for use as a temperature sensor close to the physiological range (293–323
K) with excellent linearity (R2 > 0.99).
The ability to detect temperature was estimated by the calculation
of thermal sensitivity. Both systems presented high thermal sensitivities
(>1.5%·K–1). In addition, the europium(III)
complex incorporated in the silica shell of UCNPs was found to be
sensitive to ultraviolet light, which leads to its application as
a UV-light sensor with no influence on the thermometer operation based
on the upconversion emission. The results presented in this work stimulate
the study of multifunctional materials for sensing applications based
on lanthanide luminescence. The material shows potential for application
in light-activated therapies, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and
photothermal therapy (PTT). These therapies typically require UV or
blue light for excitation. The control of light dose released to the
tissue is of great importance in these therapeutic procedures to avoid
photodamage to the surroundings. Moreover, as temperature is a fundamental
parameter in events that occur in cells, the thermometer function
is useful to guide such therapeutic processes (PDT and PTT) synergistically
with the UV dosimeter.
