Herein, we report water-soluble mitochondria-selective
molecules
that consist of a target-specific moiety conjugated with a near-infrared
(NIR) imaging agent through variable spacer length. The presented
NIR fluorescent cyanine-5 (Cy-5) chromophore exhibits excellent photostability,
narrow NIR absorption and emission bands, high molar extinction coefficient,
high fluorescence quantum yield, and long fluorescence lifetime. The
biological compatibility and negligible cytotoxicity further make
the dye an attractive choice for biological applications. Confocal
fluorescence microscopic studies in the fixed human lung carcinoma
cell line (A549) stained with the targeting NIR Cy-5 dyes (Cy-5a and
Cy-5b) at 700 nM concentration show their cellular uptake and localization,
which is compared with the nontargeting Cy-5c. Mitochondrial target
specificity is demonstrated by colocalization experiments using the
mitochondrion-tracking probe, MitoTracker Red and lysosome-tracking
probe, LysoTracker Green. Multicolor imaging of cellular organelles
in A549 cells is achieved in combination with suitable target-specific
dyes with distinct excitation and emission, such as green emitting
FM 1–43FX to selectively image the plasma membrane, blue-fluorescent
DAPI to stain the nucleus, and the synthesized NIR Cy-5 to image the
mitochondria. Higher accumulation of the dye inside the cancer cell
mitochondria compared to the noncancerous cell is also demonstrated.

Introduction
Selective targeting
and staining of particular cellular organelles
such as nucleus, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum,
and so forth is an emerging field of current research.1 However, it is exigent to work on cellular environment
due to the intricacy in biological systems. Among the different cellular
organelles, mitochondria are widespread targets for all cancer cells.2 Mitochondria play a fundamental role in programmed
cell death such as apoptosis.3 Mitochondrial
targeting, incorporation, and imaging are the critical steps for new
drug design and development processes. Inner mitochondrial membrane
(IMM) of normal healthy cells maintains a strong negative membrane
potential [(ΔΨm)normal −150
to −180 mV].4 Amendment in ΔΨm is an imperative feature of cancer [(ΔΨm)cancer ≈ −220 mV].4b This high negative ΔΨm of mitochondria is
unique and is not present in any other cellular organelle (plasma
membrane potential, ΔΨp −30 to −60
mV), which offers a design scope for selective targeting and tracking
of mitochondria. Fluorescent probes are handy for monitoring a variety
of biological processes in cells using confocal microscopy and flow
cytometry. However, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dyes (650–900
nm) have a significant advantage over the visible fluorescent dyes.5 Cellular or tissue components have negligible
absorption and minimal autofluorescence in the NIR region; hence,
highly sensitive, less scattered, and precise detection is possible
when exogenous NIR dyes are incorporated. However, it is challenging
to construct an organelle-selective organic NIR imaging agent because
most NIR dyes are restricted within their biological applications
due to photobleaching, propensity to aggregate in the buffer solution,
low quantum yield, fast fluorescence decay, and insufficient stability
in biological systems. Moreover, less target selectivity and broad
absorption/emission band of most NIR probes limit its application
to multicolor imaging of cells. Multicolor imaging and tracking of
distinct cellular organelles inside the same cell is crucial for understanding
complex biological processes.6 Our strategy
is to exploit the extraordinary biophysical membrane property of mitochondria
to target IMM, as cationic molecules should attract and accumulate
preferentially within the negatively charged mitochondrial matrix.4 In addition to the cationic character, adequate
lipophilicity is also necessary to accomplish a significant uptake
in mitochondria.7 Methodical explorations
of the target-specific cationic moiety conjugated to an NIR cyanine-5
(Cy-5) chromophore through a relatively flexible linker with variable
length have been conducted for selective targeting and staining of
mitochondria. In this article, the synthesized NIR fluorescent molecules
(Cy-5a and Cy-5b) exhibit excellent photophysical properties, exceptional
photostability, narrow NIR absorption and emission band, high molar
extinction coefficient, long fluorescence lifetime with high fluorescence
quantum yield, bright NIR fluorescence with negligible background
signal, good water solubility, outstanding biocompatibility, and low
cytotoxicity. We envision that—(1) targeting functionality
containing NIR molecule (Cy-5a and Cy-5b) should lead to a more selective,
greater, and faster uptake by mitochondria than nontargeting Cy-5c
molecule. Therefore, there is a need to inspect their mitochondrial
uptake; (2) because of narrow NIR absorption and emission band of
mitochondria-targeting Cy-5, acquisition of multicolor imaging of
cellular organelles in the same cell could be possible using a combination
of suitable dyes with distinct excitation and emission characteristics;
(3) because of more hyperpolarized ΔΨm of cancer
cells compared to normal healthy cells, the dye should accumulate
more in the cancer cell mitochondria than noncancerous cell mitochondria;
(4) cancer cell mitochondrial incorporation of the triply positive
charged Cy-5 dye is expected to depolarize mitochondrial membrane
potential. Therefore, its effect on malignant mitochondrial targeting,
incorporation, staining, membrane potential depolarization, and multicolor
imaging application is investigated using human carcinoma cell lines.

Results
and Discussion
The heterocyclic 2,3,3-trimethylindolenine
molecule is synthesized
by Fischer indole synthesis and the N of the indolenine residue is
covalently conjugated with the mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphonium
(TPP+) moiety using alkylating agents 2 and 3 (Scheme 1).8 The synthesis of Cy-5a [two −(CH2)4– spacer] and Cy-5b [two −(CH2)6– spacer] involves the condensation of heterocyclic
compounds containing an activated methyl group (4 and 5) with malonaldehydebis(phenylimine)monohydrochloride
(1), which is prepared from the commercially available
1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (Scheme 1). Cy-5a and Cy-5b (dark blue powder) are characterized
by 1D (1H, 13C, and 31P) NMR, 2D
(1H–1H DQF COSY) NMR, and high-resolution
ESI-MS (Figures S2–S7). Both the
symmetric molecules Cy-5a and Cy-5b consist of two P atoms and exhibit
one 31P NMR peak at ∼24 ppm (Figures S3a and S6a). A control dye lacking the mitochondria-targeting
TPP+ moiety (Cy-5c) is also synthesized and characterized
(Scheme 1, Figures S8 and S9).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Cy-5a,
Cy-5b, and Cy-5c Dyes
The synthesized Cy-5a and Cy-5b are small molecules with excellent
solubility in aqueous solutions (5.65 × 10–5 mol L–1 for Cy-5a and 8.15 × 10–6 mol L–1 for Cy-5b in H2O, Figures S11e, S13c) due to triply positive charge.
Moreover, they dissolve well in organic solvents. The absorption and
emission features of Cy-5a and Cy-5b are examined in various solvents
[H2O, DMF, DMSO, CH3OH, CH3CN, CHCl3] including phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer solutions (Figures 1, S10–S13). The absorption
spectra exhibited an intense peak (λmax) at 660 nm
in CHCl3 due to π → π* transitions with
large molar extinction coefficient of ca. 1.90 × 105 M–1 cm–1 for Cy-5a as well as
Cy-5b (Table S1). For both the probes,
the fluorescence maximum (λem) is observed at ca.
685 nm in CHCl3 (λex = 660) with ca. 25
nm Stokes shift (Table S1). Cy-5a and Cy-5b
exhibit modest solvatochromism in the absorption and emission with
∼20 nm bathochromic shifts being observed by decreasing the
solvent polarity from H2O to CHCl3, which is
probably due to combined effects of dielectric constant and refractive
indices of the solvents (Table S1, Figures S10, S12). The absorption and emission
spectra, shapes, and λex/λem of
Cy-5a and Cy-5b in PBS and HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, 37 °C) are comparable
to those observed in H2O (Figure S12e,f). Cy-5a and Cy-5b exhibit narrow absorption and emission bands,
which is extremely important for the multicolor imaging process, where
a combination of various dyes is frequently applied. Additionally,
no evidence of aggregation in aqueous buffer and organic solvents
is observed for Cy-5a and Cy-5b (Figures S11 and S13a), which is a crucial issue for most NIR cyanine molecules
that absorb in this range. The lack of aggregation is due to the presence
of two cationic TPP+ residues, which provide electrostatic
repulsion between molecules. Fluorescence quantum yields, Φf = 0.30 and Φf = 0.24 are observed in DMSO
for Cy-5a and Cy-5b, respectively, which are higher than that of NIR
dyes zinc phthalocyanine (Φf = 0.20 in DMSO), oxazine
1 (Φf = 0.141 in EtOH), cryptocyanine (Φf = 0.012 in EtOH), IR-125 (Φf = 0.132 in
EtOH), and comparable with other Cy-5 dyes (Table S2). Fluorescence lifetimes (τ) of Cy-5a and Cy-5b are
determined in various solvents by the time-correlated single photon
counting (TCSPC) technique. Values of τ ≈ 1.948 ns for
Cy-5a and τ ≈ 1.769 ns for Cy-5b in DMSO are found (Figures 1e, S14 and Table S3). Cy-5a and Cy-5b
dyes also exhibit modest solvatochromism in their fluorescence lifetime,
and τ is longer in CHCl3 than in H2O (Table S3).

absorption (solid line) and emission spectra (dashed line) of Cy-5b

The lipophilicity of Cy-5a and Cy-5b is determined by octanol/PBS
partition coefficient measurements using Poctanol/PBS = [C]octanol layer/[C]PBS layer.8 Cy-5b with two −(CH2)6– linkers is found to be more lipophilic (P = 7.12, log P = +0.85) than Cy-5a with two −(CH2)4– linkers (P = 2.88,
log P = +0.46) (Figure S15). To scrutinize biocompatibility and cellular localization of the
dyes, biological experiments are designed and performed.

UV/vis
experiment shows that Cy-5a and Cy-5b are highly stable
in PBS (pH 7.4, 37 °C) over 24 h (Figure S16). Moreover, these dyes are stable over a wide range of
pH (Figure S16d,e).The probable interferences
of a range of biological analytes are examined. The fluorescence experiment
of Cy-5b is performed in the presence of different crucial metal ions
(Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+,
Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ as their chloride
salts) and redox substances related with oxidative stress, including
glutathione under physiological conditions (PBS, pH 7.4, 37 °C)
(Figure S17). No obvious changes are observed
in the fluorescence spectra of Cy-5b in the presence of biological
interferents. As a proof of concept for transportation of the Cy-5
dye from aqueous buffer to lipid membrane, we prepared large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs) made of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(DOPC)/cholesterol (80:20) in HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 using the extrusion
technique (hydrodynamic diameter = 168 nm, PDI = 0.115) (Figure S18a). λem of Cy-5b is
observed at 661 nm in the HEPES buffer at pH 7.4, and when this buffer
solution of the dye is added to the LUVs, a 14 nm red-shift in λem is observed which indicates transportation of the dye from
the buffer to the lipid membrane (Figure S18b).

Cell viability studies using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay shows that the probe Cy-5a and Cy-5b have negligible
cytotoxicity against human noncancerous [peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), human embryonic kidney (HEK293), and lung fibroblast
(WI38)] and cancerous [human pancreatic (MIA PaCa-2) and lung (A549)]
cell lines at different concentrations over 24 h (Figure S19). Flow cytometric titration using Cy-5b at various
concentrations for A549 cells indicates cellular uptake and internalization
(Figure S20). Cellular imaging experiments
are carried out using confocal microscopy at 0.7 μM concentration
of the Cy-5 dye with short incubation time (10 min) on fixed A549
carcinoma cell line, resulting in bright NIR fluorescence and fast
cellular internalization (Figures 2 and S21). Both Cy-5a and
Cy-5b dyes corroborate good photostability and allow prolonged confocal
imaging without significant photobleaching. In order to confirm the
mitochondrial target specificity, colocalization experiments involving
Cy-5a and Cy-5b (λex/λem 650/675)
are performed in the fixed A549 carcinoma cell line using a commercially
available mitochondrion-tracking probe, MitoTracker Red (λex/λem 579/599) (Figure S22).9 The fluorescence image produced
using Cy-5b (log P = +0.85) exhibits high levels
of colocalization with that of MitoTracker Red [Pearson’s correlation
(PC) coefficient: 0.91 in A549 cells] (Figure 2). For Cy-5a (log P = +0.46),
PC coefficient: 0.86 in A549 cells is found (Figures 2, S21A). The observed
high PC coefficient established the mitochondrial specificity of the
two probes. Cy-5a and Cy-5b are compared with a control dye Cy-5c
(λex/λem 650/671 in DMSO, Figure S13D), lacking the mitochondria-targeting
TPP+ moiety and exhibit weaker and nonselective staining
in confocal microscopy (PC coefficient: 0.56 in A549 cells) (Figure S21B). In order to confirm the mitochondrial
selectivity of Cy-5a and Cy-5b over lysosome, colocalization experiments
are performed using a commercially available green-fluorescent lysosome-tracking
probe, LysoTracker Green DND-26 (λex/λem 504/511), which exhibits poorer overlap in confocal microscopy
(PC coefficient: 0.25 and 0.24 in A549 cells for Cy-5a and Cy-5b,
respectively) (Figure S23). This suggests
that tethering to target-specific lipophilic TPP+ cation
with NIR Cy-5 chromophore is an efficient strategy for selective mitochondrial
targeting and staining.

Figure 2 Confocal microscopic images of (a) Cy-5a and
(b) Cy-5b colocalized
with MitoTracker Red (MTR) in fixed A549 carcinoma cells. DAPI, MTR,
and Cy-5 dyes are recorded using laser excitation wavelengths at 405,
559, and 635 nm, respectively. Colocalization scatter plots of the
overlay pictures show PC: 0.86 for Cy-5a and PC: 0.91 for Cy-5b.

The TPP+ containing Cy-5 dyes can target
mitochondria
of both normal cells and cancer cells. The flow cytometric experiment
demonstrates that the Cy-5b dye penetrates both the human lung cancer
cells, A549, as well as the noncancerous WI38 cells (Figure S24). However, a 2-fold enhancement in the fluorescence
intensity of Cy-5b is found inside the A549 cancer cells compared
to WI38 noncancerous cells (Figure S24).
Flow cytometric analysis corroborates our hypothesis that the dye
is more attracted and accumulated in the mitochondria of cancer cells
compared to normal healthy cells due to higher potential gradient
of the former.4b

The tricationic
Cy-5b is expected to depolarize mitochondrial membrane
potential after internalization. To decipher our hypothesis of mitochondrial
targeting and depolarization by tricationic Cy-5b dye, mitochondrial
membrane potential changes are examined using a JC-1 dye.10 A considerable depolarization in the mitochondrial
membrane potential in A549 cells is observed after treatment with
Cy-5b. At 0.5 and 0.7 μM concentration of Cy-5b, the percentage
of cells with depolarized mitochondria increases to 21.7 and 26.2%,
respectively, without noticeable leakage of Cy-5b dye from mitochondria
(Figures 3, S25).

(c) JC-1 staining of A549 cells after incubation with Cy-5b at 0.7
μM concentration. The percentage of cells with depolarized mitochondria
increases from 6.63% (control) to 21.7% (0.5 μM Cy-5b) to 26.2%
(0.7 μM Cy-5b).

Multicolor imaging and
tracking of cellular organelles in the same
cell remains challenging because of the lack of suitable target-specific
fluorescent probes with well-separated excitation and emission bands.
Narrow NIR absorption and emission bands of mitochondria-targeting
Cy-5 prompted us for the multicolor imaging of cellular organelles
using a combination of suitable targeting dyes with distinct excitation
and emission.6 Three-color fluorescence
A549 cell staining highlighting the plasma membrane (green color),
nucleus (blue color), and mitochondria (red color) is achieved by
using lipophilic green emitting styryl dye, FM 1-43FX to selectively
stain the plasma membrane, blue-fluorescent DAPI to label the nucleus,
and Cy-5b to selectively target and stain the mitochondria of A549
cells (Figures 4, S26).

lipophilic green emitting FM 1-43FX (laser ex/em 473/590 nm) to stain
the plasma membrane (green color), blue-fluorescent DAPI (laser ex/em
405/461 nm) to target nucleus (blue color), and NIR Cy-5b (laser ex/em
635/668 nm) to selectively stain mitochondria (red color). This multicolor
imaging of cellular organelles in the same cell is acquired using
appropriate filter sets in confocal microscopy.

Conclusions
In summary, we report some unique design concepts for the development
of NIR Cy-5 molecules that have the ability to selectively target
and stain mitochondria. Submicromolar concentration of the targeting
dye is enough to localize and stain mitochondria within minutes. Narrow
absorption and emission bands permit the acquisition in multicolor
imaging application of the cells. Currently, further development of
cellular organelle-selective targeting and multicolor imaging for
targeted theranostic applications are under way in our lab. Moreover,
in vivo targeting of NIR Cy-5 dye in tumors will be explored in future.

1H–1H DQF COSY
The full 1H NMR
assignments including 1H–1H correlation
of Cy-5a, Cy-5b, and Cy-5c dyes were performed using
the 1H–1H DQF COSY experiment (Figures S4, S7, and S9b).

Methods
NMR Spectroscopy
1H, 13C, 31P NMR, and 1H–1H DQF COSY spectra
were recorded on Bruker DPX400 MHz and Bruker DPX500 MHz spectrometers
at 25 °C in suitable deuterated solvents.

HRMS (ESI)
High-resolution
electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (HRMS-ESI) result was obtained using a Q-Tofmicro
(Waters Corporation) mass spectrometer.

Absorption Spectroscopy
Absorption spectra were recorded
in various solvents on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrometer. All measurements
were carried out in a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Stabilities
of the Cy-5a and Cy-5b dyes were measured in PBS at pH 7.4, 37 °C,
over 24 h using a Peltier temperature controlling unit attached with
the UV/vis instrument.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
experiment was
performed on a HORIBA Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer in
various solvents.

Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting Experiment
Fluorescence
lifetimes of the probes were measured in various solvents using the
TCSPC technique on a HORIBA DeltaFlex lifetime instrument (HORIBA
Jobin Yvon IBH Ltd, Glasgow, Scotland, UK). A 650 nm delta diode laser
excitation source (model: DD-650L, HORIBA Scientific) was used to
measure fluorescence lifetimes of Cy-5a and Cy-5b. Data analysis and
lifetime measurements were carried out using the HORIBA EzTime decay
analysis software.

pH Meter
A Mettler Toledo pH meter
was used to prepare
PBS and HEPES buffer solutions at pH 7.4.

Calculation of Relative
Quantum Yield of Cy-5a and Cy-5b Dyes
Fluorescence quantum
yields (Φf) of Cy-5a and
Cy-5b dyes were measured by the relative method.12 Here, the integrated fluorescence intensities of the samples
were compared with fluorescence intensities of a reference compound
according to the following equation  Φf(st) and Φf(x) are fluorescence
quantum yields of the reference and sample compounds
respectively; Ast and Ax are absorbance of reference and sample at the excitation
wavelength, respectively. Fst and Fx are the integrated fluorescence areas under
the corrected fluorescence spectra for the reference and sample compounds,
respectively. ηst and ηx are the
refractive indices of the solvent in which the reference and sample
compounds are measured, respectively [here, both the reference and
sample compounds were dissolved in DMSO; therefore, (ηx2/ηst2) = 1]. “st”
stands for the standard and “x” refers to the unknown
sample. Φf(st) of zinc pthalocyanine in DMSO is 0.20,
which is used as the reference.

The relative quantum yields
(Φf) of Cy-5a and Cy-5b were measured as 0.30 and
0.24, respectively, in DMSO.

Water Solubility of Cy-5a and Cy-5b Dyes
Cy-5a and
Cy-5b dyes were separately dissolved in water with the maximum known
amount, and the solubility was determined by the UV/vis spectroscopic
method. With the known concentration of Cy-5a and Cy-5b, an absorbance
versus concentration calibration curve was plotted for both dyes.
Then, the absorbance of the saturated solution of both dyes with proper
dilution was measured and using the absorbance versus concentration
calibration curve, corresponding concentration of the dyes was determined.
This gave the measure of solubility of the Cy-5a and Cy-5b dyes in
water. Cy-5a and Cy-5b are small molecules and soluble in water because
of triply positive charge.

Determination of Octanol/PBS Partition Coefficient
Values of
Cy-5a and Cy-5b Dyes
Octanol/PBS partition coefficient values
of Cy-5a and Cy-5b were measured according to the literature procedure.8 To measure the partition coefficient of Cy-5
dye, 1 mg of each Cy-5a and Cy-5b was separately dissolved in 2 mL
octanol. Absorbance of the stock solution in octanol for Cy-5a and
Cy-5b was determined separately by UV/vis spectroscopy using proper
dilution. PBS (pH 7.4, 1 mL) and equal volume of stock solution in
octanol were mixed and vortexed for 1 m, and kept at 37 °C for
1 h to achieve equilibrium. The mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm
for 10 m to separate the organic and aqueous layers. After centrifugation,
absorbance of the organic (Ao) layer was
determined by UV/vis spectroscopy with appropriate dilution. The ratio
of absorbance in organic layer (after mixing) to that of an aqueous
layer (determined from difference in absorbance value of organic layer
before and after mixing with PBS) gives the partition coefficient
value and it is expressed as Ao/Aw.  where (Ao)i and (Ao)f are initial
and final absorbance in the octanol layer, respectively.

Partition
coefficient (P) values of Cy-5a and Cy-5b were found
to be 2.88 and 7.12, and log P values were 0.46 and
0.85, respectively.

Preparation of Lipid Film
DOPC (10
mg mL–1) and cholesterol (10 mg mL–1) were dissolved in
CHCl3. Appropriate quantities were mixed to get a defined
composition of DOPC/Ch = 80:20. The solvent (CHCl3) was
removed by N2 stream for 20 min, and the residual solvent
was removed under high vacuum for 2 h to form DOPC/Ch lipid film on
the test tube walls. The lipid films were rehydrated with an appropriate
amount of HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).

Multilamellar
Vesicles
After 1 h of incubation at T > tm, the hydrated lipid films
were subjected to five freeze/thaw cycles (immerse the sample in liquid
N2 followed by 40 °C water bath) to detach the lipid
film from the wall of the test tube, while also dispersing the vesicles.
The dispersed multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) were incubated at T > tm for 5 min and vortexed.

Large Unilamellar Vesicles
The MLV suspensions were
extruded 31 times through a polycarbonate membrane (200 nm pore size,
19 mm diameter) using a LiposoFast extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada)
at T > tm to produce
unilamellar vesicle suspension.

Dynamic Light Scattering
Dynamic light scattering experiments
were performed using a Malvern instrument (UK) to examine the hydrodynamic
diameters of the liposomes in HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. All measurements
were conducted at a backscattering angle 173° and a temperature
of 25 °C. Three runs were conducted per measurement and the average
values were taken. A monodisperse population of the liposome with
hydrodynamic diameter = 168 nm and PDI = 0.115 was observed in HEPES
buffer.

Cell Culture
Human pancreatic cancer cells (MIA PaCa-2),
lung carcinoma (A549) cells, noncancerous PBMC, human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells, and lung fibroblast (WI38) cells were cultured in
DMEM media (pH 7.4) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotic-antimycotic
solution 100× (containing 10 000 units penicillin, 10
mg streptomycin, and 25 μg amphotericin B per mL in 0.9% normal
saline). The cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in an air-jacketed
5% CO2 incubator and were routinely passaged.

MTT Assay
for Cell Viability
All cells were separately
plated at a density of ∼100 cells in a 96-well plate separately
using DMEM media with a 24 h incubation to allow appropriate cell
growth. The cytotoxic effects of Cy-5a and Cy-5b on the various cancerous
and noncancerous cell lines were determined by MTT assay. After the
24 h incubation, Cy-5 dye was treated at specified concentrations
(0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 μM) for 24 h at 37 °C. The cells were
then treated with 10 μL of MTT solution (5 mg mL–1 in PBS) for 4 h in darkness at 37 °C. Dark blue formazan crystals
was formed which were dissolved in DMSO, and the absorbance (A) was measured at 575 nm using an ELISA plate reader. The
results were expressed as the percentages of the viable cells by the
following equation:  

Flow Cytometric Analyses
Flow cytometric analyses were
carried out by a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA), and the data were analyzed by BD Cell Quest software (BD
Biosciences).

Cell Penetration Dose Determination
A549 cells (104 in number) were treated with different
doses of Cy-5 dyes
for 10 m in darkness. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended
in 400 μL PBS. The samples were subjected to flow cytometric
analysis using BD FACSVerse instrument. The overall fluorescence intensity
of dye-positive cells was measured, and the optimal concentration
was calculated from the titration.

Confocal Microscopy
Fluorescence confocal microscopic
images were acquired with an Olympus Instrument (model IX81) equipped
with a 60× and 100× oil plan apochromatic objective with
numerical aperture = 1.49. Colocalization experiments involving Cy-5a
and Cy-5b (λex/λem 650/675) were
performed in the fixed A549 carcinoma cell line using a mitochondrion-tracking
fluorescent probe MitoTracker Red (λex/λem 579/599).13 The A549 cells were
seeded on the cover slip and grown in DMEM media. Cells were fixed
for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to confocal microscopic
studies. Fixed cells were incubated with 0.7 μM solution of
Cy-5 dye at 37 °C for 10 m in darkness and then washed twice
using 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated with 0.2 μM MitoTracker
Red in darkness for 15 m, washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated
with DAPI for 15 m. After washing, following the same procedure, cells
were mounted with antiquench agent n-propyl gallate
for microscopic slide preparation and detected by a confocal fluorescence
microscope. High-resolution images were analyzed by Olympus FV1000
software.

For DAPI: laser wavelength = 405 nm, excitation wave
length = 405 nm, emission wavelength = 461 nm, BF range = 50 nm, BF
position = 425 nm. For MitoTracker Red: laser wave length = 559 nm,
excitation wave length = 559 nm, emission wavelength = 598 nm, BF
range = 55 nm, BF position = 570 nm. For Cy-5 dye: laser wavelength
= 635 nm, excitation wave length = 635 nm, emission wavelength = 668
nm, BA name = 655–755.

Mitochondrial Selectivity
of Cy-5a and Cy-5b Over Lysosome
Colocalization experiments
were performed using a green-fluorescent
lysosome tracking probe, LysoTracker Green DND-26 (Figure S1). Fixed cells were incubated with 0.7 μM solution
of Cy-5 dye at 37 °C for 10 m in darkness and then washed twice
using 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated with 50 nM LysoTracker
Green in darkness for 15 m, washed twice with 1× PBS, and incubated
with DAPI for 15 m. After washing with the same method, cells were
mounted with n-propyl gallate for microscopic slide preparation and
detected by confocal fluorescence microscope. High-resolution images
were analyzed by Olympus FV1000 software.

For LysoTracker Green
DND-26: laser wave length = 473 nm, excitation wave length = 473 nm,
emission wavelength = 519 nm, BF range = 100 nm, BF position = 485
nm.

Multicolor Confocal Imaging
Multicolor imaging of cellular
organelles in the same cell was achieved using a combination of suitable
targeting dyes with distinct excitation and emission bands. Lipophilic
green emitting FM 1-43FX was used to selectively label the plasma
membrane, blue-fluorescent DAPI to stain the nucleus, and Cy-5 to
target and stain the mitochondria of A549 cells. Multicolor confocal
imaging of cells was acquired by using appropriate filters for FM
1-43FX (laser ex/em 473/590 nm), DAPI (laser ex/em 405/461 nm), and
Cy-5 dye (laser ex/em 635/668 nm). Fixed cells were incubated with
0.7 μM solution of Cy-5 dye at 37 °C for 10 m in darkness
and then washed twice using 1× PBS. Cells were then incubated
with DAPI for 15 m followed by incubation with 8 μM FM 1-43FX
in darkness for 1 m. After washing, following the same process, cells
were mounted with n-propyl gallate for microscopic
slide preparation and detected by confocal fluorescence microscope.
High-resolution images were analyzed by Olympus FV1000 software.

Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Using JC1
Dye
Alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential was determined
with JC-1 dye (mitochondrion membrane potential assay kit) using a
FACS flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed by Cell Quest software
(BD Biosciences).10 When the potential
of mitochondria was high, JC-1 was entered from the cell membrane
to the cytosol to the mitochondria and the J-aggregates of JC-1 were
formed. However, in case of membrane depolarization, the J-aggregates
leak out from the mitochondria to the cytosol as monomers. The λex for JC-1 was 494 nm and the λem was observed
at 535 nm (green fluorescence for JC-1 monomers) and at 595 nm (orange-red
fluorescence for JC-1 aggregates). Then, the fluorescence emission
ratio of monomers to aggregates (535/595) was evaluated. The higher
value of this ratio indicates higher membrane depolarization. A549
cells were stained with JC-1 dye for 15 min with 1 mg mL–1 JC-1 in the culture medium at 37 °C in darkness; then, mitochondrial
membrane potential was determined using the FACSVerse flow cytometer
and the data were analyzed by Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences).
After cellular staining with JC-1 dye, the fluorescent signal was
analyzed in the FITC and PE channels using a 494 nm laser.
