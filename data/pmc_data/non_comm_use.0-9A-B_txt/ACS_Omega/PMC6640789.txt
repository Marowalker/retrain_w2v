The effects of sodium thiocyanate, sodium chloride, and
sodium sulfate on the ribonuclease barnase were studied using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) and NMR. Both measurements reveal specific
and saturable binding at low anion concentrations (up to 250 mM),
which produces localized conformational and energetic effects that
are unrelated to the Hofmeister series. The binding of sulfate slows
intramolecular motions, as revealed by peak broadening in 13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy. None of the
anions shows significant binding to hydrophobic groups. Above 250
mM, the DSC results are consistent with the expected Hofmeister effects
in that the chaotropic anion thiocyanate destabilizes barnase. In
this higher concentration range, the anions have approximately linear
effects on protein NMR chemical shifts, with no evidence for direct
interaction of the anions with the protein surface. We conclude that
the effects of the anions on barnase are mediated by solvent interactions.
The results are not consistent with the predictions of the preferential
interaction, preferential hydration, and excluded volume models
commonly used to describe Hofmeister effects. Instead, they suggest
that the Hofmeister anion effects on both stability and solubility
of barnase are due to the way in which the protein interacts with
water molecules, and in particular with water dipoles, which are more
ordered around sulfate anions and less ordered around thiocyanate
anions.

Introduction
Solutes are known
to influence the physical properties of water, such as surface tension
and viscosity.1 They are also known to
influence the properties of biological molecules, in particular their
solubility and stability.2−5 The mechanisms underpinning solute
effects have attracted the attention of researchers for over a century.
The field was initiated by Franz Hofmeister who demonstrated the ability
of various salts to influence the solubility of protein ensembles
found in hen egg white.2,6 These effects were found to be
consistent for a range of proteins, which allowed the salts to be
ordered by the extent of their effect on solubility into the “Hofmeister
Series”, given in Scheme 1 for the anions. Cations have much less effect compared
to anions.3,7 In the 1960s, von Hippel demonstrated that
protein stability was affected by the same Hofmeister ordering.3,4 Hofmeister effects have been shown to occur at moderate to high
salt concentrations (100–2000 mM).2,7,8

Scheme 1 Hofmeister
Series
A number of models have been developed
to explain the molecular mechanism by which salts influence protein
solubility and stability, but there is still no universally accepted
model.5a,5c,6,9 Understanding these mechanisms is particularly important
for companies in the biotechnology sector who aim to develop formulations
that maintain the stability, solubility, and activity of their biotherapeutics
for prolonged periods.10 Hofmeister originally
described the effects of salts on solubility in terms of their ability
to “withdraw” water from the protein.2,6 Salts
that withdrew water from the protein decreased solubility and those
that were less able to withdraw water increased solubility. This developed
into the water structure maker/breaker theory in the 1930s, in which
the higher charge density anions at the left of the series (kosmotropes)
enhance the ordering of water and the lower charge density anions
on the right (chaotropes) break it, leading to effects on both solubility
and stability.1a This hypothesis has been
challenged on the grounds that the large effects seen on protein solubility
and stability could not be caused just by effects of the anions on
the solvent, and that the expected effects on bulk solvent have not
been observed, and the three most popular current theories are the
preferential interaction, preferential hydration, and volume excluded
effect models.11 In the first model, solubilizing/destabilizing
solutes (chaotropes) are described as preferentially interacting with
the protein surface, which leads to a decrease in stability and an
increase in solubility.5e,12,13 The other two models are similar to each other: precipitating/stabilizing
solutes (kosmotropes) are said to be preferentially excluded from
the protein surface (i.e., preferentially hydrated) where they exert
an excluded volume effect, essentially by removing “free”
water, thereby increasing stability and decreasing solubility.5a,13 Low charge density anions have been shown to associate with protein
surface charges and screen protein–protein interactions more
effectively than high charge density anions.5a The extent to which low charge density anions prevent protein–protein
interactions was found to correlate with their position in the Hofmeister
series, adding support to the preferential interaction model. Low
charge density (poorly hydrated) anions such as thiocyanate are believed
to interact with surface-exposed hydrophobic residues and induce protein–protein
interactions between positively charged proteins. It is believed that
these interactions could explain Hofmeister effects for such anions,
in contrast to the high charge density anions which have been shown
not to interact with hydrophobic groups.14 NMR spectroscopy has been recently employed to study interactions
between various Hofmeister salts, proteins, and synthetic peptides.9f,13,15,16 Findings
from these experiments have suggested that low charge density anion
(destabilizing/solubilizing) effects are mediated by their ability
to interact with areas on the peptide backbone. The high charge density
anion (stabilizing/precipitating) effects are said to be caused by
an excluded volume effect as these anions were not observed to interact
with the peptide backbone.9f,13 On the other hand, it
is noteworthy that the Hofmeister effect is not noticeably affected
by protein concentration,17 which would
be expected for the preferential interaction model.

Here, we
studied the effects of three Hofmeister series salts: sodium thiocyanate
(destabilizer/solubilizer), sodium chloride (neutral), and disodium
sulfate (stabilizer/precipitator) on a catalytically inactive mutant
of the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease
barnase.18 Sodium was used as a common
monovalent cation because it is generally considered to be a “neutral”
ion, in the center of the cation Hofmeister series, and is observed
to have little effect on protein solubility or stability.7,19 We used differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to look at the effects
on thermal stability, and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy to probe
site-specific effects at backbone amides and carbonyls, as well as
backbone and side chain CH groups. The results indicate that none
of the three popular models is able to provide a satisfactory explanation
of the data. We show that the anions, regardless of their position
in the Hofmeister series, do interact with the protein surface, in
similar places, but only at low concentrations (<250 mM) where
Hofmeister effects are still small and not dominating. Therefore,
the preferential interaction model is invalid. At higher concentrations
of up to 1 M, there is no observable increase in interactions with
the protein surface for any of the anions, and there is no preferential
interaction with hydrophobic groups, even for thiocyanate. This suggests
that all of the anions exert their effects by altering the interaction
of the protein with water: in other words, the preferential hydration
and excluded volume effect models have elements of truth but are not
fully consistent with the data. We propose a refinement of the structure
maker/breaker model, based on a three-stage mechanism for the effects
of anions previously proposed by the authors,7,8 in
which at low concentrations, anions interact with the protein surface
but have relatively small and site-specific effects on stability,
whereas the Hofmeister effects at high anion concentrations are due
to the stabilizers/precipitators organizing water dipoles around themselves
and thus reducing the ability of water to solvate protein surfaces,
whereas the destabilizers/solubilizers disrupt the organization of
dipoles within bulk water and therefore allow the protein to be better
solvated.

Experimental Section
Protein Expression, Purification, and Sample Preparation
All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. The
catalytically inactive H102A mutant of B. amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease (barnase) was overexpressed in Escherichia
coli M15 [pRep4] cells transformed with a pQE-60 plasmid
using M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose (NMR sample) and was purified
using Q-sepharose and SP-sepharose ion exchange chromatography, as
described.20 To minimize the presence of
solutes, the samples were dialyzed extensively against ultrapure high-pressure
liquid chromatography-grade water and the buffering capacity of barnase
itself was used to maintain the pH of the sample, which was checked
before each experiment and no substantial changes were observed. For
the DSC experiments, the stock solution contained 1 mg/mL unlabeled
barnase, 100% H2O, pH 6.5, and for the NMR experiments,
the stock solution comprised 0.5 mM 15N,13C
barnase, 10% D2O/90% H2O, pH 6.5. Both samples
were stored at −80 °C until required.

DSC Experiments
DSC experiments were conducted
in a TA Instruments differential scanning calorimeter (Nano DSC; TA
Instruments, New Castle, DE). The sample cell contained 40 μM
(0.5 mg/mL) barnase, pH 6.5, in the presence of 0–1000 mM NaSCN,
NaCl, or Na2SO4 with the reference cell containing
the corresponding salt concentration with no protein. All samples
were degassed on a degasser from TA Instruments for 60 min at 20 °C
before loading into the DSC. The DSC was equilibrated
until the heat difference between the sample and reference cells was
changing by <0.003 μW/s. All samples were run with
a temperature range of 20–90 °C and heating rate of 1.5
°C/min; the sample and reference cell pressures were set to 3
atm, and another prescan equilibration phase of 600 s occurred before
heating. Data analysis was conducted with the NanoAnalyze software
provided by the manufacturer. Ultrapure water baselines were subtracted
from sample data using NanoAnalyze. The melting temperature (Tm) of barnase was taken to occur at the temperature
with the maximum heat capacity. The reversibility of barnase unfolding
was assessed under the experimental conditions given above, and it
was found that barnase unfolding cannot be considered to be a two-state
unfolding as only 60% of barnase refolded. For this reason, we did
not include enthalpy and entropy data in the analysis.21 All concentrations for each salt tested were
run in duplicate apart from the 50 and 750 mM points.

NMR Experiments and Data Processing
All
NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on an 800 MHz Avance I Bruker
spectrometer equipped with a room-temperature 5 mm probe and triple-axis
gradients. Proton chemical shifts were referenced to 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-(2H4) propionate (TSP, Sigma Aldrich) at 0.0 ppm. 15N and 13C chemical shifts were calculated relative
to TSP by using the gyromagnetic ratios of 15N, 13C, and 1H nuclei (γ(15N)/γ(1H) = 0.101329118 and γ(13C)/γ(1H) = 0.251449530). Chemical shift values were obtained from
entry 4964 in the BioMagResBank22 and were
used to confirm resonance assignment of barnase using 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), 1H,13C HSQC, three-dimensional (3D)-HNCO, 3D-HNCA,
3D CCH-total correlation spectroscopy, and 3D HCCH-TOCSY experiments.
The salt titration experiments were carried out separately in 3 mm
NMR tubes (Norell) and used 0.5 mM (0.33 mM for the NaCl titration) 15N,13C barnase, 10% D2O/90% H2O, pH 6.5, and TSP at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250,
500, 750, and 1000 mM NaSCN, NaCl, or Na2SO4. Use of a 3 mm tube proved essential to avoid large losses in sensitivity
and increases in pulse widths, which were recalibrated for each measurement.
Barnase 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical
shifts were monitored by the acquisition of 1H,15N HSQC, 1H,13C HSQC, and two-dimensional (2D)
HNCO spectra using TopSpin 2.1 at each salt addition. Spectra were
processed and peaks were assigned using the FELIX software (Felix
NMR, Inc., San Diego, CA), and data were analyzed using home-written
scripts running under Linux. Peak intensities were measured using
the peak intensity (rather than the volume, which proved less reproducible),
using identical acquisition and processing parameters (except pulse
lengths). The solvent-accessible surface area was calculated from
the PDB file 1a2p using the program naccess. Fitting to eq 1 followed a two-stage procedure.
Chemical shift changes were first fitted to a simple linear equation
(the first term of eq 1). Nuclei that fitted were classified as having linear shift changes.
Nuclei that had poor fits (a χ2 value >20) were
then fitted to the complete equation, using a home-written implementation
of the Levenburg–Marquardt nonlinear least-squares fitting
routine. Any nuclei that gave a χ2 value <20 in
this fitting were classified as having both curved and linear shift
changes, while the rest were rejected.

Results
DSC
The effect
of thiocyanate on the thermal stability of H102A barnase was investigated
using DSC (Figure 1) and has two distinct stages. The first stage occurs at concentrations
<100 mM where thiocyanate anions have a slight but significant
stabilizing effect on the protein. At around 100 mM, there is a clear
transition as thiocyanate promotes significant destabilization at
higher anion concentrations, as expected from the Hofmeister series
(DSC thermograms for each thiocyanate concentration tested are shown
in Figure S1). The effects of chloride
and sulfate on the thermal stability of barnase were also investigated
(Figures S2 and S3). The thermograms at
high chloride concentrations (≥100 mM) and all concentrations
of sulfate displayed signs of barnase aggregation. The profiles were
less reproducible than that for thiocyanate, which is likely due to
aggregation occurring before Tm is reached,
and showed asymmetry with the downward slope after Tm having a steeper gradient than the upward curve (Figure S4). Protein aggregation is a characteristic
of anions at the left end of the Hofmeister series, such as sulfate,
and therefore this result is not surprising. Sulfate has a two-stage
effect: at concentrations <100 mM, there is no significant effect
on Tm, whereas above 100 mM, it has a
significant stabilizing effect, in line with the Hofmeister series.
Chloride effects a small but significant stabilization of barnase
by about 0.7 °C up to 100 mM, but it has almost no effect at
higher concentrations, as expected from its position in the Hofmeister
series. In summary, although the DSC results have limited scope, we
can conclude that the effects of thiocyanate, chloride, and sulfate
on barnase stability and probably also on solubility follow the Hofmeister
series, but only at anion concentrations >100 mM. Similar conclusions
were reached in our previous studies.7,8

(NaSCN) concentration in ultrapure water at pH 6.5. Error bars are

NMR Titrations: Overview
NMR chemical shifts
of H102A barnase with increasing concentrations of thiocyanate, chloride,
or sulfate were measured for backbone 15N and 1HN nuclei (using 1H,15N HSQC spectra),
backbone 13C carbonyl nuclei (using 2D HNCO spectra), and
aliphatic 1H and 13C nuclei (using 1H,13C HSQC spectra). Approximately linear chemical shift
changes with anion concentration were observed for most nuclei at
concentrations from 250 mM upward. However, many nuclei also showed
curved chemical shift dependences at concentrations below about 250
mM, which display a variation in magnitude at different locations
within barnase. Typical curves for a selection of amide protons (Y24,
A30, A32, L42, A43, I51, R83, D86, K98, and T100) in the presence
of thiocyanate, chloride, and sulfate are shown in Figure 2. The curved parts of the chemical
shift profiles have the appearance of typical binding saturation curves,
and we therefore hypothesized that the curved responses arise from
anion binding, being either a direct effect of binding or an indirect
conformational or dynamic change induced by anion binding (discussed
in more detail below). We therefore fitted the data at each site to eq 1(23) 1  where Δδi is
the observed change in chemical shift, m is the gradient
for the linear chemical shift change, Δδmax is the maximum change in chemical shift upon saturation, Kd is the dissociation constant, and [P]i and [L]i are the
total concentrations of protein and ligand, respectively. The first
term in the equation corresponds to the linear chemical shift change,
whereas the second is a standard ligand-binding saturation curve,
also known as a binding isotherm. Similar equations have been used
previously.5a,9f This equation models the observed
chemical shift change as being the sum of a linear term plus one resulting
from anion binding. It assumes that the chemical shift change observed
at each nucleus is affected by a single binding event, which seems
a reasonable approximation given that the chemical shift effects due
to binding of anions are likely to be very localized. Most nuclei
could be fitted well to this equation. We first tried fitting the
shift changes to a simple linear chemical shift change versus anion
concentration (the first term in eq 1). Nuclei that fitted poorly to this were then fitted
to the complete eq 1.
This resulted in three groups of nuclei: those that fit to a linear
equation; those that do not fit well to the linear equation but do
fit to the full equation (and therefore have fitted Kd and Δδmax as well as gradient);
and those that do not fit well to either, and were ignored. Fitted
parameters are summarized in Tables S1–S18, and some examples and further details are presented in Figure S5.

(■), or (C) Na2SO4 (▲). Symbols

to eq 1; Y24 (aqua),
A30 (orange), A32 (brown), L42 (black), A43 (yellow), I51 (green),
R83 (red), D86 (blue), K98 (pink), and T100 (purple).

The good quality of the fitting
suggests that this simple model is appropriate, and thus that the
three anions studied all show a two-stage effect: site-specific binding
with a variable magnitude of chemical shift change and a more generalized
linear anion effect at higher concentrations. This result compares
well with the DSC results and suggests that the linear effect is the
one likely to correspond to the Hofmeister series.

The fitted Kd values cover a wide range of values: 35 ±
26, 52 ± 33, and 18 ± 20 mM for NaSCN, NaCl, and Na2SO4, respectively, over all atoms that fitted to eq 1 (Tables S1–S18). These values report on the binding affinity
of the anions at different sites on the protein surface, and a wide
range of affinities is expected, varying according to the shape and
charge of the protein surface. Barnase is a ribonuclease that attacks
RNA phosphate esters and has two surface-exposed binding sites for
phosphate ester groups.24 One would therefore
expect to see some sites with a reasonably high affinity as well as
sites with a much lower affinity. With binding affinities in the tens
of mM, the binding sites should be saturated by 100–200 mM,
explaining the change in the shift patterns in this range (Figure 2). We now analyze
the results from different nuclei in more detail.

1H,15N HSQC Experiments
Figure 3 shows an
enlargement of an area within the 1H,15N HSQC
spectra recorded in the presence of increasing concentrations of thiocyanate,
chloride, and sulfate (overlays of the complete spectra are given
in Figures S6–S8 for thiocyanate,
chloride, and sulfate, respectively). The spectra show that for thiocyanate
and to a lesser degree for chloride, backbone amide groups are sensitive
to anion concentrations, with some peaks (e.g., L42 and R83) moving
quite considerably, whereas for sulfate the peaks do not generally
show large positional changes. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the locations of solvent-exposed
amide protons in barnase with amide protons that exhibit nonlinear
chemical shift changes with increasing thiocyanate, chloride, or sulfate
concentration. Most amide groups with nonlinear relationships are
solvent exposed and reach saturation at around 100–250 mM salt,
with fitted Kd values in the range 1–100
mM. It is therefore likely that the nonlinear chemical shift changes
arise from the binding of anions to the protein surface. It is noteworthy
that the three anions studied caused similar relative magnitudes of
nonlinear changes in chemical shift (Tables S1, S3, and S5), suggesting that all three interact with the protein
backbone and/or affect its conformation in similar ways. This is not
the behavior expected in the preferential interaction model.

(C) Na2SO4. Concentrations: 0 (black), 10 (red),

and 1000 mM (black).

(i.e., protons
with a surface-accessible surface area >0 Å2) and
the positions of amide protons exhibiting a nonlinear relationship
between chemical shift and (B) NaSCN, (C) NaCl, and (D) Na2SO4 concentration.

The nonlinear chemical shift changes have very variable magnitudes
at different sites (Tables S1, S3, and S5). For some amide groups, the changes are so large as to produce
excessive line broadening resulting in signal disappearance. Very
large changes are seen for L42 and R83, with all three anions. These
residues are close to the active site, which is set up to bind and
stabilize the negative charge of ribonucleotide phosphates, and have
a high density of positively charged side chains. It is therefore
not surprising that anions should bind preferentially here. It is
not possible to position a single anion so that it can bind simultaneously
to the backbone amides of both L42 and R83, which are over 7 Å
apart. Thus, the large chemical shift changes at both positions suggest
either that two anions are binding or that the shift changes are caused
by a conformational change rather than by direct binding.

The
buried amide protons with nonlinear responses to anion concentration
are from residues A30, A46, I51, and I88 for thiocyanate, residue
I51 for chloride, and residues Y13, I25, A30, A46, I51, G53, D54,
F56, E73, D75, R87, I88, and L89 for sulfate. It is striking that
most of these residues are close to the active site and define the
same regions for all three anions, implying that anion binding causes
similar changes in the structure and/or dynamics of barnase. The effects
of sulfate are, however, much more extensive. Sulfate is a large high
charge density anion with highly directional electron density, which
means it will have a greater ability to distort the structure and
dynamics of barnase.

The nonlinear chemical shifts discussed
so far arise from anion binding at specific locations in barnase with
some additional consequential changes in conformation and/or dynamics
at low anion concentrations (<250 mM) and are unrelated to the
Hofmeister series. Hofmeister effects are suggested to be associated
with the linear shifts seen at higher anion concentrations. For the
amide protons, the linear chemical shift changes with increasing anion
concentration are largely downfield for thiocyanate and upfield for
chloride and sulfate (Figure 5). This is consistent with a relationship between the fitted
gradients and Hofmeister effects because sulfate and chloride both
stabilize proteins, and thiocyanate at the opposite end of the Hofmeister
series destabilizes proteins.7,8,13 We suggest that because the chemical shift changes observed are
linear and are not saturable, they arise from interactions of the
amide groups with solvent rather than with the anions themselves.
Moreover, linear effects are observed for nearly all exposed amide
groups, and there are not enough anions in solution to produce a general
effect such as this. However, the most powerful evidence that the
chemical shift changes arise from interactions with solvent comes
from a per-residue comparison of the linear shifts caused by the different
anions. There is a weak but clear correlation across the protein between
the shifts caused by one anion and shifts caused by another (Figure 5), showing that the
origin of the shifts is similar for all anions. Downfield chemical
shifts in amide protons are normally interpreted as resulting from
stronger hydrogen bonding. It therefore appears that thiocyanate causes
an increased hydrogen bonding interaction between exposed amides on
the protein and solvent, whereas chloride and sulfate both cause a
decreased interaction. This is what would be expected if thiocyanate
decreases the strength of interactions between one water molecule
and another, thereby freeing water molecules to hydrogen bond to protein,
whereas chloride and sulfate both strengthen interactions between
the water molecules, thereby leaving less free water to hydrogen bond
to protein.

each salt plotted for all amide protons:
(A) chloride vs sulfate gradients, (B) thiocyanate vs sulfate gradients,
(C) thiocyanate vs chloride gradients. Black points represent solvent-inaccessible
amide protons, and red points represent solvent-accessible amide proteins
as calculated by the naccess software. In (A)–(C),
Pearson correlation coefficients ρ are 0.26, 0.30, and 0.57
for buried amide protons, and 0.45, 0.08, and 0.43 for solvent-exposed
amide protons. In the majority of cases, these translate into statistically
significant correlations using the Fisher transformation.

HNCO Experiments
Figure 6 shows an
expansion of an area within the HNCO spectra recorded in the presence
of increasing concentrations of thiocyanate, chloride, and sulfate
(overlays of the complete spectra are given in Figures S9–S11). The results show that backbone carbonyl
groups are sensitive to anion concentrations: some peaks move considerably
for thiocyanate and chloride although they do not move as much for
sulfate. The results are similar to those obtained for the 1H,15N HSQC experiments, in that residues display both
linear and nonlinear chemical shift components (Figure 7), and the locations of residues with nonlinear
components are similar for the three anions and are mainly on the
surface (Figure 8).
The fitted binding affinities are consistent with those measured for
the 1H,15N HSQC data. Detailed results are presented
in Tables S7–S12.

Carbonyl
carbon chemical shifts may change because of cation binding to the
carbonyl group, anion binding to the amide group within the same peptide
bond, a perturbation in the hydrogen bonding interaction either at
the carbonyl oxygen or amide proton, or a conformational change of
the backbone. Previous experiments have suggested that sodium cations
are excluded from backbone carbonyl groups, making the first explanation
unlikely.25

We note that the residues
showing the largest carbonyl carbon shifts are the same as those showing
the largest amide proton shifts, in particular L42 and R83. This makes
the second explanation unlikely and strongly suggests that these chemical
shift changes are in both cases due to conformational changes and
not to direct anion binding.

1H,13C HSQC Experiments
1H,13C HSQC spectra with the three anions (Figures S12–S14) show a combination of linear and nonlinear
effects, similar to the 1H,15N HSQC and HNCO
spectra (Tables S13–S18). The results
are less complete than for the 1H,15N HSQC and
the HNCO data because of greater peak overlap and interference from
the water signal. We have not attempted to measure signals from aromatic
groups. Chemical shifts for C–H groups were most sensitive
to thiocyanate and chloride and least sensitive to sulfate. Many of
the chemical shift changes observed in the thiocyanate and chloride
titrations were linear, that is, the curvature was too small to be
significant (Figure 9). Exceptions to this trend occurred for aliphatic groups at residues
Q2, K27, Q31, V36, A37, N41, L42, D44, I51, S57, and F82 for thiocyanate
and Q2, L14, V36, A37, G40, N41, I51, N77, T79, and D93 for chloride.
The majority of these residues are close to the active site of barnase,
as seen for the amide proton and carbonyl carbon data, confirming
preferential binding of the anions close to the positively charged
active site. In contrast, the sulfate anion caused widespread nonlinear
chemical shift changes.

extensive peak broadening, and thus a loss in signal intensity, in
both exposed and buried residues, to a much greater extent than seen
for chloride or thiocyanate. Figures S1, S16, and S17 show the intensity ratio between HSQC peaks at 0 and
1000 mM NaSCN, NaCl, and Na2SO4, respectively.
The largest losses in intensity occurred for Na2SO4, whereas NaCl and NaSCN showed much smaller decreases in
intensity during the titration. Site-specific peak broadening during
NMR titrations can arise from a number of factors, which have in common
a slowing down of a dynamic exchange process so that it becomes comparable
in rate to the chemical shift changes produced by the exchange.26 Most commonly, the exchange process is detachment
of the ligand. This is very likely to be the reason for the line broadening
observed for a small number of highly shifted resonances in the 15N HSQC titrations discussed above: the off-rate of the ligand
becomes comparable to the difference in chemical shift between free
and bound species. However, this is unlikely to be the explanation
for the peak broadening seen during the sulfate titration because
sulfate in general causes the smallest shift changes of the three
anions (Figure 9C).
Furthermore, the peak broadening induced by sulfate is seen not just
for surface residues but also for a large number of buried residues,
implying that the explanation is not limited to a surface phenomenon
but extends into the interior of the protein. Instead, we propose
that the peak broadening is likely to arise from a restriction of
internal motions in the protein induced by sulfate. To appear as peak
broadening, the dynamics must be slowed to a range similar to the
carbon chemical shift differences, which approximates to around 103 s–1. The intramolecular motions in barnase
that are closest to this timescale are collective motions typified
by interdomain fluctuations.27
Thus, we propose that addition of sulfate slows interdomain fluctuations
in barnase, this effect being much larger than that caused by chloride
or thiocyanate.

A particular interest in the 1H,13C HSQC titrations was whether the low charge density anion
thiocyanate (SCN–) interacts preferentially with
hydrophobic regions. It has been proposed that this could explain
Hofmeister effects for such ions,28 in contrast to the high charge density
anions, which have been shown not to interact with hydrophobic groups.1−3 From our experiments, there is
no evidence to support this idea. Although nonlinear relationships
were seen for methyl groups with thiocyanate, they were also observed
for both chloride and sulfate at the same positions. Similarly, the
linear chemical shift changes fit the pattern seen for amide proton
and carbonyl carbon nuclei in the 1H,15N HSQC
and HNCO spectra. This constitutes strong evidence against the preferential
interaction model.

Discussion
The DSC and NMR results presented here provide a consistent atomic
resolution picture of the interactions of anions with barnase. At
low concentrations (up to about 250 mM), all three anions bind at
similar sites, particularly in and around the active site, with affinities
in the 1–100 mM range. The interactions are mainly with the
protein backbone (and presumably with polar side chains, not studied
here) and not with hydrophobic regions. These interactions have small
effects on protein stability unrelated to the Hofmeister series. Hofmeister
effects are manifested at concentrations in the range 100–1000
mM and arise from changes in the way barnase interacts with solvent,
which is altered by anion concentration. These findings suggest that
the Hofmeister effect cannot be explained in terms of preferential
interaction/hydration or an excluded volume effect and make it unlikely
that any explanation based on specific interactions of the protein
surface with anions can be valid. The nonlinear relationship between
anion concentration and chemical shift observed in this work has been
previously reported for thiocyanate with elastin-like polypeptide
and the thermoresponsive polymer poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide).9f,15 The two-phase behavior characterized
here (specific non-Hofmeister binding at low concentration, with Hofmeister
effects at high concentration) was described previously by us in DSC
studies on lysozyme, where we showed that the onset of Hofmeister
behavior occurs at different concentrations for different anions (550,
210, and 120 mM for sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and sodium phosphate,
respectively).7,8

We propose that the effect
of Hofmeister anions on cosolute stability and solubility is due to
the ability of the anions to modulate the properties of water around
the protein. Kosmotropes (e.g., sulfate) have high charge density.
They are therefore effective in ordering water molecules around themselves.
It is well established that bound water molecules have very short
residence lifetimes, even at the surface of proteins.29 Kosmotropes therefore are unlikely to bind individual water
molecules for significant lifetimes, but they do lead to an increased
ordering of water molecules in their vicinity. In particular, they
order the dipoles of water molecules around themselves.30 This statement can be rephrased in the language
of thermodynamics: The structure of water is a balance between enthalpy
(hydrogen bonds, i.e., dipole–dipole interactions), which tends
to increase the degree of local order, and entropy, which tends to
decrease it. Kosmotropes shift the balance toward an increase in local
order, organized around the kosmotrope. The surface of a protein
consists of multiple charged/polar and nonpolar chemical species.
Optimal solvation of these species requires the surrounding water
molecules to be oriented in certain energetically preferred ways.
The protein is thus competing with cosolutes (and bulk water) to organize
water molecules optimally (an idea originally proposed by Hofmeister).2,6 If the cosolute is a kosmotrope, then the protein is outcompeted,
with the result that the protein is more poorly solvated. The protein
therefore becomes less soluble. A consequence of the poorer solvation
is that intramolecular interactions are strengthened, and the protein
becomes more stable. (Note that Figure 5 shows that solute concentration affects the chemical
shifts not only of exposed amides but also of buried amides to a similar
extent: a reflection that a protein in solution is part of a single
thermodynamic system and that perturbation of the solvent-exposed
face affects the entire protein.) Protein stability and solubility
are delicate balances between two large opposing energies. As the
concentration of the kosmotrope increases, its effects become stronger.
At a salt concentration of 1 M, there are roughly 28 water molecules
per dissociated ion for salts such as NaCl and NaSCN and 19 for Na2SO4. Thus, there will be many water molecules that
are not in the direct solvation sphere of either protein or cosolute.
Nevertheless, the overall thermodynamic balance is enough to affect
the solubility and stability of the protein markedly.

Chaotropes
(e.g., thiocyanate) have the opposite effect. They have low charge
density, and thus organize water molecules poorly. In fact, a chaotrope
organizes water molecules less effectively than water itself, which
results in the hydrogen bonding network around a chaotrope being less
defined than it is in pure water.31 Therefore,
a protein is better able to organize water molecules around itself
in ways that match its solvation requirements when in the presence
of chaotropes than in pure water. Chaotropes therefore lead to increased
solubility and (following the argument above) decreased stability.

There is another explanation for the effects of Hofmeister anions
on protein stability. Protein stability can be expressed as the difference
in free energy between a folded protein and an unfolded protein. An
unfolded protein has a much larger surface area than a folded protein,
and therefore has many more interactions with solvent. Kosmotropes
make water dipoles less available for interaction with proteins. They
therefore increase the free energy of unfolded proteins more than
they do for folded proteins, and so preferentially stabilize folded
proteins. These two explanations are different aspects of the same
balance of free energies.

The discussion above presents the
effect of cosolutes on protein stability as a thermodynamic competition
between the hydration of the anion and the hydration of the protein
surface. Figure 10 presents data extracted from the literature, showing the relationship
between the free energy of anion hydration and protein stability (measured
as the change in melting temperature obtained from DSC measurements),
for the proteins lysozyme, protein L, protein L K28Q, and ribonuclease
A.3,7,8,13,32 The relationship is remarkably
consistent, further supporting the argument that the Hofmeister effect
on stability is due to the ability of anions to modulate water structure
and not due to specific interactions of the ions with protein surfaces
or through an excluded volume effect. It has been calculated that
anions (particularly the kosmotropes) are preferentially excluded
from a protein’s apolar surfaces, but the molecular mechanism
of the effect has been elusive.33b The
discussion here provides a simple explanation, namely, that the anions
have lower free energy when fully hydrated by water than they do when
bound to the protein. Thus, it is not that they are actively excluded
from the protein surface, more that they have a lower free energy
when they do not interact directly with the protein. However, as discussed
here, the anions do make a number of specific interactions with proteins,
with affinities in the millimolar range. Thus, we agree with the thermodynamic
analysis of Record’s group33 and
others,5 although we see the exclusion
of ions from the protein surface as a consequence of rather than an
explanation for the Hofmeister effects. However, we find no evidence
for specific interactions with hydrophobic side chains, which calls
into question a common model for the effect of osmolytes on protein
stability.34 Our proposals have features
in common with the theories of Lo Nostro and Ninham,35 which focus on ion polarizability in the interactions among
ions, water, and protein, and with many recent studies that focus
on interfacial effects.9b

(red), nitrate (black), bromide (brown), iodide (orange), perchlorate

sodium.

The advent
of terahertz spectroscopy
at the turn of the millennium, the increased sensitivity of calorimetric
techniques, and improved computing power have expanded the toolbox
of techniques available to researchers to study protein and ion hydration.
These studies have suggested that hydration layers surrounding ions
and proteins are more complicated and extend further than originally
determined.36,37 Terahertz spectroscopy experiments
have highlighted an extended population of water molecules around
a number of different proteins that are distinctly different from
water molecules in the bulk.38 Pressure
perturbation calorimetry (PPC) has recently suggested that some ions
have hydration layers up to two molecules thick.37 All of this work continues to add weight to the argument
that it is the modulation of water molecules around proteins that
causes the Hofmeister effect.

Conclusions
In summary, we have used DSC and NMR to analyze the ability of
three Hofmeister anions (thiocyanate, chloride, and sulfate) to modulate
barnase thermal stability and to interact with solvent-exposed groups
of barnase. NMR experiments showed that all Hofmeister anions were
able to interact with barnase at low anion concentrations, and DSC
studies showed that at these low concentrations, protein stability
is influenced to a small degree that did not follow the Hofmeister
series. In fact, the effects are consistent with an “inverse
Hofmeister series”.5a Once these
sites were saturated, the anions exert their effects by interacting
with water rather than interacting with the protein. High charge density
anions restrict the ability of water molecules to reorientate their
dipole moments. As water reorientations become more restricted with
increasing anion concentrations, the protein is less able to be effectively
hydrated because the water orientations needed to keep the protein
soluble become too high in energy to be populated. This effect reduces
protein solubility and increases protein stability. Low charge density
anions increase the conformational freedom of water molecules, allowing
the protein surface to be hydrated more effectively, which increases
protein solubility and decreases protein stability. We suggest that
Hofmeister anions exert their effect on protein stability and solubility
by altering the ability of water molecules to solvate the protein,
rather than through a preferential interaction, preferential hydration,
or excluded volume effect.
