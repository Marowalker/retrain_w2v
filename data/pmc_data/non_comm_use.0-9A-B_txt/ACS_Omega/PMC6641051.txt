We demonstrated time-dependent
mass transport mechanisms of Au-assisted
chemical etching of Si substrates. Variations in the etch rate and
surface topology were correlated with catalyst features
and etching duration. Nonlinear etching characteristics were associated
with the formation of pinholes and whiskers. Variable rates of mass
transport as a function of whisker density accounted for the nonlinear
etch rates of Si. Nanopinholes on Au catalysts facilitated the vertical
mass transport of reactants and byproducts, which dramatically changed
the etch rate, surface topology, and porosity of Si. The suggested
transport models describe the transient mass transport and the corresponding
chemical reactions.

Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D) semiconductor architectures
are being adapted
to multiple electronic and photonic applications to address technical
challenges that are associated with performance and power reduction.1−4 To fabricate high-aspect-ratio semiconductors, dry etching is conventionally
used to produce anisotropic vertical profiles. Dry etching exposes
a semiconductor surface to ion bombardment in vacuum chambers that
are equipped with gas supply systems and a radio frequency generator.
Plasma ions dislodge the semiconductor and inevitably cause crystal
defects.5 Various types of defects frequently
occupy the mid-gap level in the bandgap energy and act as recombination
and generation sites. Coulombic scattering decreases carrier mobility,
and transient charge trapping and detrapping increase, which tends
to compromise both device performance and reliability. As the features of Si integrated circuits have been consistently
scaled to the nano level over the years in 3D architecture, researchers
have noted that crystallographic defects adversely affect the control
of electrostatic potential over highly scaled Si devices. For compound
semiconductors, process-induced defects are a more challenging issue
because of their elemental stoichiometry.6 Moreover, other challenges associated with dry etching are that
the achievable etch depth is limited by the bottling effect and the
etch rate is dependent on the aspect ratio. The etch rate of dry etching decreases substantially as a function
of etch depth because of low gas flow and the limitations in the etching
species arriving at the bottom of the feature.7 As an alternative to the conventional dry etching technique, metal-assisted
chemical etching (MACE) was first proposed by Li and Bohn.8 This etching is a wet-based process that increases
the rate of chemical reaction through a metal catalyst. A metal catalyst
deposited onto the semiconductor decreases the activation energy required
for chemical etching.9 MACE can be conducted
in a conventional semiconductor wet bench at atmospheric pressure.
In the absence of plasma-induced charges in vacuum chambers, damage-free
3D semiconductor structures can be fabricated at a low manufacturing
cost. Subsequent studies have confirmed MACE by varying the processing
conditions of semiconductor materials,10−12 doping level,13−15 etchant composition,16−18 and catalyst features.19−22 For example, the porosity of
Si substrates and etch rates were controlled via variation in the
volumetric ratio of HF:H2O2 etchant. In MACE,
these ratios are expressed as ρ = [HF]/([HF] + [H2O2]), and the lower the ρ value, the greater the
amount of excessive hole h+ produced by H2O2 during etching. This affects etch rate and etching morphology
as well as porosity.23−25 This ratio, however, did not affect the stability
of the metal catalyst.18 Furthermore, etchant
temperature has been demonstrated to determine the etching direction
at the interface of metal catalysts and semiconductors. At low temperatures,
MACE of GaAs occurred outside of the catalyst; however, at relatively
high temperatures, etching occurred directly under the catalyst.26 As the temperature increases, the etch rate
became faster.27 Catalyst thicknesses are
known to substantially affect the mass transport of reactants and
byproducts. As the thickness of the Au catalyst decreased, vertical
mass transport became dominant via pinholes in the catalyst. Enhanced
mass transport rates of reactants and byproducts resulted in feature-independent
etching characteristics of the catalyst.19 When thin metal catalysts were deposited onto Si substrates using
physical vapor deposition systems, nanoscale Si whiskers were observed
after MACE.20,28,29 A number of Si whiskers were locally formed in the metal catalyst
via nanopinholes. After etching, a porous Si was frequently observed
with whisker formation. In general, the porous Si regime was attributed
to the excess electronic holes, which were not completely consumed
directly under the catalysts.30 However,
one did not attempt to correlate these physical characteristics (i.e.,
the porous Si regime and the Si whiskers) with mass transport in chemical
etching. In this study, variations in the etch rates as a function
of catalyst thickness and etch duration were correlated with the formation
of a porous Si regime and the localized Si whiskers. Time-dependent
mass transport models were used to describe the nonlinear etch rates
during MACE.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
tilted scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of Si substrates
after MACE for 10 min with various Au thicknesses. Au catalysts were
dot-mesh patterns (4 μm diameter opening and 3 μm space
covered with metal) with thicknesses of (A) 20, (B) 30, (C) 40, and
(D) 50 nm. The insets show the lateral and vertical dimensions in
an enlarged image after etching. Chemical etching with dot-mesh patterns
occurred under Au catalysts and formed an array of Si pillars. Reverse
chemical etching did not occur. Au catalysts with various thicknesses
exhibited substantial differences in the etch rate and surface topology.
When relatively thin (20 and 30 nm) Au catalysts were used, as shown
in Figure 1A,B, high-aspect-ratio
Si pillars were fabricated at an etch rate of approximately 1.3 μm/min.
Certain Si whiskers were observed on the Si substrates, as shown in
the insets. When the catalyst thickness was increased to 40 nm (Figure 1C), relatively short
Si pillars were fabricated at a reduced etch rate of 1 μm/min.
When the Au catalyst thickness was further increased to 50 nm (Figure 1D), the etch rate
was substantially reduced to 0.2 μm/min, the Si pillars were
not shaped correctly, and the topology of the Si was severely deformed.
The results show that as the thickness of Au increases, the lateral
etch rate increases while the vertical etch rate decreases. In Figure 1A,B, with a thin
Au catalyst, a conical shape appeared at the top of the Si pillar
after etching. During the etching process, initially, lateral etch
was more active than vertical etch for a short period of time. Afterward,
vertical etching rate increased, surpassing the lateral etching rate,
and a Si pillar structure was formed. Figure 1D, in which a thick Au catalyst was used,
shows a tapered conical Si shape. This shows that the lateral etch
with a thick Au catalyst is more active than the lateral etch with
a thin Au catalyst.

Figure 1 Tilted SEM images of Si after MACE for 10 min. Au catalysts
were
dot-mesh patterns (4 μm diameter opening and 3 μm space
covered with metal) with thicknesses of (A) 20, (B) 30, (C) 40, and
(D) 50 nm.

Figure 2 shows the
SEM images of the cross section of Si substrates after Au-assisted
chemical etching with Au catalysts of various thicknesses for 15 min.
To compare the etch characteristics more clearly, chemical etching
of Si was conducted on solid-stripe-patterned Au catalysts (8 μm
wide metal stripes and 6 μm spaces between stripes) with thicknesses
of (A) 20, (B) 30, (C) 40, and (D) 50 nm. A cross section was made
on the trenches. Note that Si whiskers were grown in the trenches
after chemical etching and the density of the whiskers varied with
the thickness of the metal catalyst. Dense Si whiskers were formed
on a smooth bottom trench when a thin 20 nm Au catalyst was used,
as shown in Figure 2A. In the case of the 30 nm Au catalyst, the etch rate was almost
identical and the density of Si whiskers was slightly reduced compared
with that of the Si whiskers formed with the 20 nm Au catalyst. Porous
Si was observed on the top and gradually decreased, where Si whiskers
were present. As shown in Figure 2C, when thick 40 nm Au catalysts were used, the Si
etch rates substantially decreased and etching did not occur uniformly
under the Au catalysts; moreover, the Si whisker formation was negligible.
The 50 nm thick Au catalysts severely deformed the Si substrates,
as shown in Figure 2D, and resulted in a rough Si surface topology. Thick catalysts tend
to cause a rough surface topology, particularly in the case of micron-scale
MACE, because of nonuniform etch rates at the edge and center of the
metal catalysts.19,30−32 Long diffusion
path during the lateral mass transport causes this phenomenon. Therefore,
we attribute the dramatic difference in surface topology and etch
rates as functions of the Au catalyst thickness to mass transport
through the nanopinholes of the Au catalyst. The dominant transport
mechanism switched from lateral to vertical mass transport, with decreasing
metal catalyst thickness.

Figure 2 SEM images of the cross section of Si substrates
after etching
for 15 min on solid-stripe patterns of Au catalysts (8 μm wide
metal stripes and 6 μm spaces between stripes) with thicknesses
of (A) 20, (B) 30, (C) 40, and (D) 50 nm.

Figure 3 shows
the
etch-rate variation as a function of etching time for Au catalysts
of various thicknesses. The etch depths in the inset were measured
after chemical etching of dot-mesh Au catalysts. The thin Au catalysts
exhibited faster and more uniform etch rates than the thick Au catalysts.
The wide error bars for the thick Au catalysts in the inset reflect
the nonuniform and rough surface topology. Note that the chemical
etch rates of Si were nonlinear as MACE proceeded. The nonlinearity
of the etch rate was more clearly observed for thinner Au catalysts.
In the case of the 20–30 nm thickness, the etch rates rapidly
increased in the early stage of MACE. After the highest
etch rates were achieved, chemical etching diminished and then saturated.
This stage is presumably mass transport-limited because reactants
and byproducts cannot diffuse from the etchant to the Au catalysts
faster than the chemical reaction. With 40 nm Au catalysts, the etch
rate was reduced compared with those achieved with the 20 and 30 nm
Au catalysts. The time required to reach the highest etch rate increased.
In the case of the 50 nm Au catalysts, the etch rates substantially
decreased over the entire range of etch duration and did not exhibit
a distinct variation in etch rate.

Figure 3 Etch-rate variation as a function of etch
time for Au catalysts
of various thicknesses. Etch depths shown in the inset were measured
after chemical etching of solid-stripe patterns of Au catalysts.

The variable etch rates observed
for the thin Au catalysts are
related to the mass transport of reactants and byproducts via the
metal catalyst nanopinholes. When only lateral mass transport occurred
for thick metal catalysts, undesirable outcomes such as metal catalyst
bending, low etch rates, and porous Si were observed. By contrast,
when vertical mass transport occurred with lateral mass transport
in the case of the thin metal catalysts, high diffusivity of reactants
and byproducts dramatically enhanced the etch rates, micron-scale
uniformity, and the surface topology of the Si substrates.19,33 The formation of whiskers indicates that vertical mass transport
rates were enhanced through the nanopinholes. The porous Si remaining
on the top surface after etching is related to the whisker formation,
which will be discussed in detail later.

Figure 4 shows the
progress of whisker formation on the recessed Si substrates in the
cross-sectional SEM images after 20 min of etching with 30 nm Au catalysts.
As shown in Figure 4A, different heights of whiskers were grown on the recessed Si substrates,
which suggests that the rate of whisker formation was time-dependent.
High-density whiskers were observed on the bottom Si substrates. Because
whiskers were formed via locally distributed nanopinholes in the Au
catalysts, this phenomenon was more prominent for the thinner Au catalysts.
Another notable feature is the porous Si on the top surface. The voids
in Si decreased as chemical etching proceeded along the trench depth.
Si tends to be porous because of the lateral diffusion of electronic
holes to the other regions of catalysts. The formation of porous Si
is related to the amount of excessive holes that cannot be used for
etching. In this experiment, a solution of high ρ value was
used and the amount of holes produced by H2O2 was not very large. However, in the initial stage of etching, mass
transport did not occur smoothly and etching did not proceed well.
This resulted in the formation of excessive holes and porous Si despite
the small amount of holes generated. Figure 4B compares the densities of whiskers calculated
from Figure 4A using
ImageJ, which is a two-dimensional image-processing software program.
The whisker density increased as a function of etch depth, which supports
the etch-rate variation, as shown in Figure 3. Initially, the rate of whisker formation
was low, but then it increased sharply and finally saturated. At low
rate of whisker formation, lateral mass transport was the dominant
mechanism for the diffusion of reactants and byproducts, which resulted
in low and nonuniform etching. As chemical etching proceeded, many
whiskers were formed through nanopinholes via short-range MACE; moreover,
long-range MACE under the catalysts occurred simultaneously.

Figure 4 (A) Progress
of whisker formation on the recessed Si substrates
in the cross-sectional SEM images after 20 min of etching with 30
nm Au catalysts and (B) variation in the density of whiskers as a
function of etch depth.

Figure 5 shows
the
mass transport models of nonlinear Au-assisted chemical etching and
the corresponding whisker and void distributions. At the initial stage
of MACE (A, incubation), short-range MACE in the Au catalyst for whisker
formation did not occur. Mass transport for chemical reaction occurred
only in the lateral direction of the Au–Si interface.

Figure 5 Mass transport
mechanisms of nonlinear Au-assisted chemical etching
and the corresponding whisker and void distributions: (A) incubation,
(B) formation, (C) acceleration, and (D) saturation.

The porous Si tended to form because of the limited
diffusivity
of the reactants and byproducts. After the incubation stage, nanopinholes
began to form in the Au catalysts (B, formation). The mass transport
path of the reactants and byproducts required for chemical etching
became short via nanopinhole sites, which increased the etch rate
and uniformity. Si whiskers grew through the pinholes simultaneously.
As the number of pinholes continued to increase, the etch rate increased
sharply with enhanced mass transport at the interface of the Au catalysts
and Si substrates (C, acceleration). When vertical mass transport
drove the redox processes under the Au catalysts, the chemical etching
rate dramatically increased. Electronic holes were completely consumed
during chemical etching under the catalysts, and a porous region did
not appear in the Si substrates. After the acceleration, MACE rate
was reduced, presumably because the diffusion of reactants and byproducts
was limited at the bottom. Another possible explanation is that the
pinholes that improved the mass transport have now weakened the durability
of the Au catalysts, reducing the catalytic activity for complete
chemical reactions (D, saturation).33

Conclusions
We demonstrated the nonlinear characteristics of Au-assisted chemical
etching of Si substrates. The variability in the MACE rate was interpreted
as four characteristic stages according to the Si whisker formation
and mass transport. The incubation stage represented low and nonuniform
etch rates of porous Si. In the formation stage, whiskers were generated
via nanopinholes. Vertical mass transport facilitated the chemical
reactions, which substantially increased the etch rate of Si. As the
density of whiskers increased sharply, the etch rate reached its highest
value in the acceleration stage. After prolonged etching, the Au catalyst
was subject to deformation, which eventually reduced its catalytic
activity in the saturation stage.

Experimental Methods
Boron-doped p-type Si(100) substrates with a resistivity of 5–10
Ω·cm were used for MACE. The substrates were precleaned
with conventional acetone, isopropanol, and deionized (DI) water.
Dot (4 μm diameter and 3 μm spaces) and stripe arrays
(8 μm width and 6 μm spaces) were photoresist-patterned
using image-reversal optical lithography. Organic residues were descummed
using a plasma asher after photolithography. Native oxide was removed
using a buffered oxide etchant, and Si substrates were rinsed with
DI water before metallization. Au catalysts were thermally evaporated
onto the Si substrates at a 2 Å/s deposition rate under a 10–6 Torr pressure. Various thicknesses (20, 30, 40, and
50 nm) of Au catalysts were deposited onto the Si substrates after
the liftoff process. For MACE, a mixture containing 0.47 M hydrogen
peroxide as an oxidant and 5.65 M hydrofluoric acid was stirred into
the DI water for 20 min. The solution temperature was maintained at
50 °C in a water bath, and the samples were then etched in the
solution for various times (4, 7, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, 20, 25, 30,
and 35 min) and the etch rates were monitored accordingly. Etching
was stopped by thoroughly rinsing the sample with DI water and drying
it in an N2 stream. The height of the etched structure
was measured using field-emission SEM, and the etch rate was calculated
based on the pillar height.
