Accurate prediction and modeling of an enzyme’s
active site
are critical for engineering efforts as well as providing insight
into an enzyme’s naturally occurring function. Previous efforts
demonstrated that the integration of constraints enforcing strict
geometric orientations between catalytic residues significantly improved
the modeling accuracy for the active sites of monomeric enzymes. In
this study, a similar approach was explored to evaluate the effect
on the active sites of homomeric enzymes. A benchmark of 17 homomeric
enzymes with known structures and a bound ligand relevant to the established
chemistry were identified from the protein data bank. The enzymes
identified span multiple classes as well as symmetries. Unlike what
was observed for the monomeric enzymes, upon the application of catalytic
geometric constraints, there was no significant improvement observed
in modeling accuracy for either the active site of the protein structure
or the accuracy of the subsequently docked ligand. Upon further analysis,
it is apparent that the symmetric interface being modeled is inaccurate
and prevented the active sites from being modeled at atomic-level
accuracy. This is consistent with the challenge others have identified
in being able to predict de novo protein symmetry. To further improve
the accuracy of active site modeling for homomeric proteins, new methodologies
to accurately model the symmetric interfaces of these complexes are
needed.

Introduction
Enzymes are proteins that carry out specific
chemical reactions
that have been utilized in various industries, such as pharmaceuticals,
agriculture, and biofuels. Their high specificity, high catalytic
efficiency, and nontoxic and ecofriendly characteristics are some
reasons that enzymes have gained interest in their use in industrial
applications.1,2 Even with these advantages, enzymes
are hindered in industrial applications when it comes to stability,
catalytic efficiency, and specificity.2 There have been different approaches taken within the field of enzyme
engineering to combat these issues, and one of those is computational
protein design. This approach is dependent on structure–function
relationships and therefore requires a structure of the enzyme of
interest.2

Experimentally determined
structures of proteins have been obtained
with the progress of structure elucidation techniques, such as X-ray
crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryogenic electron
microscopy, but these techniques have not been able to keep up with
the sequencing efforts made over the years. An alternative to these
experimental structure elucidation techniques is the computational
structure prediction method homology modeling. Homology modeling allows
for the determination of a three-dimensional model of a protein sequence
(target) using the information of experimentally determined structures
of homologous proteins (templates). Previous studies have demonstrated
that homology modeling pipelines can result in higher accuracy structures
when supplemented with additional information, such as sparse NMR
distance constraints, low-resolution cryo-electron microscopy, mass
spectrometry-derived cross-linking, and evolutionary relationships
derived from sequence homology.3−12

Our lab recently demonstrated that utilizing the knowledge
of an
enzyme’s reaction mechanism to serve as additional information
resulted in significant improvements in the accuracy of the modeling
of monomeric enzyme active sites using homology modeling.13 However, many enzymes have multiple, symmetric
chains, and therefore it is critical to also evaluate if the integration
of knowledge from the enzyme’s reaction mechanisms can improve
the active site modeling to atomic-level accuracy for symmetric enzymes.
To evaluate symmetric enzymes, a highly curated benchmark of 17 homomeric
enzymes was developed in order to examine if both symmetry and catalytic
geometric (CG) constraint information would enable an atomically accurate
modeling of the enzyme active site.

Results and Discussion
Catalytic Residue Conservation within the Homomeric Enzyme Benchmark
Homomeric enzymes that varied in sequence length, symmetry, and
performed different chemical reactions based on enzyme commission
(EC) classification were chosen to ensure a diverse set of enzymes
were tested with this benchmark (Table 1). The interatomic distances between the catalytic
residues serve to define the CG constraints used in modeling each
enzyme family. In order to analyze the structural conservation of
the catalytic residues used in the modeling of the target sequences
for the benchmark, the Cα root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) for the catalytic residues as well as all residues was calculated
(Figure 1A).

crystal structures and their templates used in the benchmark. The

As expected, the rmsd of all the residues within the
enzyme increased
as a function of percent identity between the template and the target
(Figure 1A). However,
the rmsd of the catalytic residues remained relatively consistent
and did not change as a function of the percent identity of the template.
The catalytic residues of an enzyme family are well known to be highly
conserved across enzyme families in terms of sequence as well as structure.14,15 The Thornton group investigated the relationship between the rmsd
values of Cα and Cβ atoms of the
catalytic residues of structures within a family versus the percent
identity. They also showed that no matter what the percent identity
of the structure within an enzyme family, the rmsd was between 1 and
5 Å, with 80% having an rmsd below 1 Å for three and four
catalytic residues.15 The trend that is
seen with the catalytic residues for this benchmark supports the relationship
seen from the work done by the Thornton group and the monomeric benchmark
from our group.13

With the analysis
showing that the CG constraints for this benchmark
were consistent with the previous observations of the structural conservation
of catalytic residues, the standard deviations for the atom pairs
Cα–Cα, Cβ–Cβ,, and Cα–Cβ were determined to provide bounds to use with CG constraints
(Figure 1B–D).
The histograms of each of the atom pairs show a Gaussian distribution
with standard deviations of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.7 among the Cα–Cα, Cβ–Cβ, and Cα–Cβ pairs of the
catalytic residues, respectively. These standard deviations were on
par with the standard deviations seen for monomeric enzymes, where
the standard deviation was 0.5 for all the three atom pairs.13

Homology Modeling
The target sequences for the 17 enzymes
in the benchmark were modeled with the information from symmetry definition
files derived from the top template of each target and in the presence
and absence of additional CG constraints (Table S3). When applying the CG constraints, weights of 1, 10, 100,
and 1000 were evaluated between the Cα–Cα atom pairs (Figure S3).
There was only a modest difference in the change in modeling among
the four weights; therefore, models generated with a weight of 1 were
used for all further analyses as they had the smallest average rmsd
and standard deviation.

The Cα rmsd values
of the two sets of models described above were compared in three categories:
all residues, catalytic residues, and active site residues (Figure 2A–C). The
graphs pertaining to the rmsd values of all the residues and the active
site residues show that on average there is no improvement to the
models as a whole with the addition of the CG constraints. This does
not hold true though when looking at the rmsd values of the catalytic
residues when the CG constraints were implemented. For 12 out of 17
models, there was an improvement resulting in an rmsd of less than
1 Å between the models and crystal structures when the constraints
were used. The five where improvement was not seen can be attributed
to the use of the low percent identity of the template used to dictate
the symmetry when modeling was done.

Figure 2 Analysis of the Cα rmsd
of the lowest five models
for each enzyme in the benchmark with and without the incorporation
of the CG constraints with a weight of 1. The rmsd was determined
by comparing the target crystal structure to the models that were
generated. Each point represents the average rmsd of the lowest five
models, and the color of each point in the graphs represents the percent
identity of the top template used for modeling. Any point seen below
the line was seen as an improvement in modeling, on the line there
was no change, and above the line, it was seen as a lack of improvement.
(A) All residue rmsd. (B) Active site rmsd (residues within 8 Å
of the ligand). (C) Catalytic residue rmsd.

Even with the improvements seen in the modeling
of the catalytic
residues with this homomeric benchmark set, as was the case with the
monomeric benchmark from our lab, a global analysis of the models
highlighted a consistent shift of the symmetric units. Analysis of
global protein structures are highlighted in Figure 3, where four representative models are aligned
on one chain with the target crystal structure. Qualitatively, it
is seen that there is a high level of accuracy for one chain and a
systematic error in the atomic details for the placement of symmetric
units. This shift could be attributed to the use of symmetry definition
files when modeling as it dictates how to generate the initial configuration
of the symmetry of all the units within a protein and how the system
may be perturbed while maintaining symmetry.5 The exact orientation of the subunits is kept constant throughout
the homology modeling simulations, and therefore if this initial placement
is not atomically accurate, the subsequent models generated will never
be modeled at atomic accuracy.

symmetry definition files represented in cartoon and ribbon forms.
The crystal structure is depicted in a deep purple color with the
models overlaid on top. (A) Model for 2o4p is depicted in blue (chain A) and dark
gray (chain B). (B) Model for 3mng is depicted in blue (chain A) and dark

(chain D).

This occurrence is similar to the results obtained
with the oligomeric
structure prediction done by Park et al.16 Using symmetry definition files for modeling oligomeric proteins,
they found two similar results. The first was an improvement in the
structure quality of the monomeric state when modeling the oligomeric
state. The second was that the oligomeric state was correctly identified,
but the model was not as accurate as other structure prediction methods.
The reasons they provided why this occurred were due to poor template
selection and incorrect sequence alignment.16 The template selection can be the case here. By choosing the top
template’s symmetry definition file to dictate the model’s
symmetry, the subtle angstrom difference from the target enzyme symmetry
can equate to the shifts seen in modeling. The ribbon images of the
models for the four enzymes represented in Figure 3, and the others seen in Figure S7, provide us with a qualitative analysis that supports
the results found by Park et al.16

To determine quantitatively if the monomeric modeling with the
enzymes in our benchmark also improved when modeling the homomeric
state, we examined the rmsd of all the residues and active site residues
for the single chain and multiple chains of our models. In addition
to the homomeric benchmark, we also examined the rmsd of the monomeric
benchmark to determine if the difference came from lower accuracy
templates in the homomeric benchmark or if it is specifically from
the symmetry information. The all-residue rmsd with the incorporation
of CG constraints is seen in Figure 4A and the active site rmsd with the incorporation of
CG constraints is seen in Figure 4B. When looking at the active site rmsd for the models
from the monomeric benchmark, we can infer that all the machinery
is in place with the homology modeling pipeline to improve monomeric
models with the use of CG constraints. To provide a critical comparison
between the accuracy of the models of the two benchmarks, a two-tailed t test was performed. A p value of significance
in Figure 4A was only
found between the monomeric versus multiple chain comparison, and
there was no significant difference observed between the monomeric
versus single chain and single chain versus multiple chain unit comparisons.
A significant p value in Figure 4B is seen between the monomeric versus homomeric
benchmarks. In addition, the modeling accuracy of the enzyme active
sites in monomeric enzymes was found to be significantly higher than
what was achieved for homomeric enzymes (Figure S5C). Overall, from this analysis, we can infer that the low
accuracy of active site modeling of homomeric enzyme active sites
is derived from modeling the symmetric units.

rmsd values between the monomeric and homomeric
benchmarks. Each point in (A,B) represents the average rmsd for the
lowest five models. The single chain represents the rmsd of only the
single chain (chain A) between the crystal structures and models within
the homomeric benchmark. The multiple chain represents the rmsd analysis

by performing a two-tailed t test. (A) Analysis between
the target crystal structure and models with catalytic constraints

chain was 0.37, monomeric-multiple chains was 0.037, and single chain–multiple
chain was 0.081. (B) Analysis between the target crystal structure
and models with catalytic constraints for active site residues. The p value between the monomeric and homomeric benchmarks was
0.035.

This result identified a direct avenue for future
method development,
specifically in methods that will further refine the exact positioning
of relative subunits within a symmetric protein. Computational methods
to sample rigid body orientations within the defined symmetric space
could potentially improve the modeling accuracy of homomeric enzymes.
Computationally intensive methods to sample rigid body positioning
have been highly successful in the design of atomically accurate symmetric
proteins and should be explored for how to integrate into the homology
modeling pipeline as a potential approach to increase the modeling
accuracy of homomeric proteins.17,18

Docking Analysis
Although the active sites of the modeled
symmetric enzymes did not achieve atomic accuracy with or without
CG constraints, it was still pertinent to evaluate the current docking
methods to understand the current performance in these modeled systems.
From the homology models generated with and without CG constraints,
the respective ligand conformational library was docked into the active
site using enzymatic constraints. The enzymatic constraints used in
the docking protocol were the distance and angle information that
need to be satisfied between the catalytic residues and the ligand
in order for the chemical reaction to take place. The rmsd values
of the heavy atoms of the ligand were calculated between the two sets
of models to evaluate the docking accuracy (Figure 5). The docking simulations carried out for
all the enzymes in the benchmark can be seen in Figure S6. The data in Figure 5 show that the rmsd of the ligand showed improvement
for about half of the docking runs, whereas the other half did not,
with the incorporation of CG constraints during homology modeling.
This is not unexpected as there was no significant change observed
in the modeling of the active site between these two methods. The
five points that have the rmsd greater than 4 Å seen in Figure 5 correspond to the
enzymes with PDB codes 1ctu, 1dqx, 1qin, 2o4p, and 4hgo. The zinc metal
where catalysis occurs is in close vicinity of the crystal structure
ligand even though the ligand rmsd for 1ctu resulted in a higher rmsd when the CG
constraints were implemented (Figure S6A). The high rmsd in the ligand for 1dqx can be attributed to the fact that there
is one catalytic residue, lysine, interacting with the ligand for
the chemical reaction to take place. The limited amount of chemical
information added to the docking coupled with the low-accuracy active
site modeling of this protein makes this a particularly challenging
enzyme to model (Figure S6B). The high
rmsd of the ligands for 1qin (Figure S6E), 2o4p (Figure S6F), and 4hgo (Figure S6O) is likely because of the high degrees of freedom present for these
ligands. The average number of ligand conformations among the three
enzymes was 39 690, whereas the average number of ligand conformations
for the other 14 enzymes was 541 (Table S6). This could also highlight the need to apply a filter for ligands
that are larger and have many rotatable bonds that are not cofactors,
as with thiamine pyrophosphate, to reduce the sample space when docking
is performed. This was not used here, and so there was no bias of
one conformation over another in the libraries when the docking protocol
was carried out.

Figure 5 Analysis of the ligand rmsd of the 17 enzymes from the
benchmark
when docking was performed on the lowest five models with and without
the incorporation of the enzymatic constraints. The rmsd was determined
by the heavy atoms of the ligand and comparing the target crystal
structure ligand to the docked ligand of the models. Each point represents
the average rmsd of the lowest five models, and the color of each
point in the graphs represents the percent identity of the top template
used for modeling.

The average rmsd of ligands for models generated
without and with
CG constraints is 3.26 and 3.47, respectively. For the models without
the implementation of CG constraints, roughly 30% had an rmsd less
than 2 Å and 70% had an rmsd greater than 2 Å when docking
was performed. For the models where CG constraints were implemented,
47% had an rmsd less than 2 Å and 53% had an rmsd greater than
2 Å when docking was performed. Therefore, using current protocols
in situations where atomic accuracy is needed, homology modeling has
the potential to be useful for enzyme families with a highly conserved
placement between symmetric units or monomeric enzymes.

Conclusions
The results obtained from the models generated
in this study are
in agreement with previous studies which identified the challenges
in interfacial modeling between the subunits of symmetric proteins.16 Work pertaining to the improvement of rigid
body sampling involved with the symmetry definition files within Rosetta
may help to obtain atomic resolution models that could then be used
in downstream applications, such as small-molecule docking and design.19,20 An additional factor not taken into consideration in our modeling
efforts is the dynamic and flexible nature of protein states. From
this arises the question as to what the best route for comparison
of our models is, as we could very well be modeling an accurate state
of the protein that is not reflected by the crystal structure, which
is a known challenge in the field.21−23

The ability to
rapidly generate models with atomically accurate
active sites of symmetric proteins is of the utmost importance for
understanding a protein’s function and our ability to modulate
a protein’s functional properties for industrial and medical
applications. Although significant strides have been made in recent
years at improving the modeling for monomeric proteins, atomically
accurate modeling of symmetric proteins remains a significant challenge.19,20,23−25

Methods
Construction of Benchmark Set of Homomeric Enzymes
The benchmark set consists of 17 homomeric enzymes (Table 1). These 17 enzymes were picked
on the basis that they ranged from different EC classes, the active
sites were at the enzyme interface, and the target crystal structure
contained a mechanistically relevant ligand in the active site. The
mechanistically relevant molecule served the purpose of ensuring that
the residues involved in catalysis for the target crystal structure
are geometrically oriented in the correct positions for the chemical
reaction associated with that enzyme to occur.

Integration of the Enzyme Reaction Mechanism: CG Constraints
The classification of the catalytic residues that were used for
the CG constraints for modeling was the same as those described by
the Thornton group: direct chemical role in the mechanism, effect
on another residue that is directly involved in the mechanism, stabilization
of a transition-state intermediate, and aid in the catalysis by having
an effect on the substrate or cofactor.26 The catalytic residues were obtained by performing a literature
search for each of the 17 enzymes. These catalytic residues were then
checked against the mechanism and catalytic site atlas online database.
The ones available on the database matched with what was determined
in the literature (Table S1).27

The analysis for the generation of the
CG constraints to be utilized during modeling was performed as described
previously.13 Briefly, the templates that
were used for the modeling of their respective target sequences all
belong to the same enzyme family and were all aligned to their respective
target crystal structures. The Euclidean coordinates of the Cα and Cβ carbons were extracted to perform
the analysis of Cα rmsd and Cα–Cα, Cβ–Cβ, and
Cα–Cβ distance deviations.
The calculations of the distances derived between the catalytic residues
within an enzyme family were performed from the target crystal structure
to get all combinations of Cα–Cα, Cβ–Cβ, and Cα–Cβ distances and applied as CG constraints
during homology modeling (Figure S2).

Homology Modeling
Three-dimensional models of the 17
targets in the benchmark were generated using the RosettaCM protocol.28 The templates for the generated models were
identified using HMMER, and the matches that were chosen were those
with the lowest e values, had a percent identity
of 80% or below, and had a biological unit available (Table S2).29 The cutoff
for the templates was set to 80% to ensure that the target crystal
structure, or highly related homologs, was not used as one of the
templates. To correlate the sequence position to structure position,
PROMALS 3D was used to generate a multiple sequence alignment from
the sequences of these templates and the target sequence.30 To fill in the unaligned regions during molecular
modeling, structural fragment sets were generated using standard methods31 Evolutionary constraints were used to enhance
sampling during multitemplate fragment-based modeling through RosettaCM.10 A weight of 1 was used when modeling was performed
with the added CG constraints. One hundred decoys were generated of
the target sequence with the lowest five energy models selected to
perform docking. The version of Rosetta used for modeling was: 17be250fab3b65d60d806025d7219a5373754924.

Symmetry
The symmetry information of the models was
dictated by a symmetry definition file that was generated using a
perl script make_symmdef_file.pl found within the
Rosetta modeling suite. The script was applied to all the biological
units of the templates in the benchmark to generate a symmetry definition
file and an input PDB. The input PDB corresponds to a single chain
from the template complex and was used in symmetry modeling within
the RosettaCM protocol. The symmetry definition file of the top template,
defined as the template with the highest sequence homology, for each
target sequence was used in modeling (Table S3).

Docking
The ROSETTALIGAND protocol was used for the
docking of the ligand into the models of the 17 targets.32,33 The ligand structures for the benchmark were pulled from the crystal
structure available from the PDB Web site. The structures were loaded
onto GaussView 5.0 to complete the valence of the atoms, and then
a conformation library of the ligands was generated using the Spartan’16
suite semiempirical method.34−36 The atoms in the ligands are
allowed to sample all conformer spaces, with the exception of those
described in Table S4. The conformation
library of the ligands generated was used to dock into the models
generated. The docking protocol used enzymatic constraints pertaining
to the distance and angle information needed to be satisfied between
the catalytic residues and the ligand in order for the chemical reaction
to take place. The lowest five apo models from the homology modeling
protocol described before were used to generate 1000 docking decoys,
which gives a total of 5000 docking decoys for each target. A pool
of the lowest 10% structures was filtered based on their total score
from each of the five apo models. These pooled docked models were
then filtered on the basis of their constraint score and interface
binding score between the ligand and enzyme. With these criteria,
the lowest five docked models were compared to the target crystal
structure ligand to calculate the ligand rmsd of the heavy atoms.
The version of Rosetta used for docking was: eb376c9763fb0fcbc2d45692a80e423cb7d474f0.
