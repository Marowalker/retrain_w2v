Self-assembly characterizes the fundamental
basis toward realizing
the formation of highly ordered hierarchical heterostructures. A systematic
approach toward the supramolecular self-assembly of free-standing
guanine nucleobases and the role of graphene as a substrate in directing
the monolayer assembly are investigated using the molecular dynamics
simulation. We find that the free-standing bases in gas phase aggregate
into clusters dominated by intermolecular H-bonds, whereas in solvent,
substantial screening of intermolecular interactions results in π-stacked
configurations. Interestingly, graphene facilitates the monolayer
assembly of the bases mediated through the base–substrate π–π
stacking. The bases assemble in a highly compact network in gas phase,
whereas in solvent, a high degree of immobilization is attributed
to the disruption of intermolecular interactions. Graphene-induced
stabilization/aggregation of free-standing guanine bases appears as
one of the prerequisites governing molecular ordering and assembly
at the solid/liquid interface. The results demonstrate an interplay
between intermolecular and π-stacking interactions, central
to the molecular recognition, aggregation dynamics, and patterned
growth of functional molecules on two-dimensional nanomaterials.

Introduction
Molecular self-assembly
represents a “bottom-up”
approach in controlling the growth and fabrication of biointegrated
materials with the desired functionality within nanometer precision.1,2 The self-assembly and molecular ordering from a random (disordered)
to well-patterned (ordered) structure is paramount in the large-scale
fabrication of three-dimensional structural motifs and hierarchical
architectures.3−5 Recent examples include self-assembled DNA motifs,6 which find applications in DNA-based microarrays
(i.e., DNA chips),7 the detection of proteins
involved in cell signaling (i.e., protein chips),8 sensing for the rapid detection of functional molecules
and pathogens, and biomolecular recognition at the solid/liquid interface.9−11

Of the four DNA nucleobases, guanine (G) has drawn considerable
research interest over the past few years. The low ionization potential
coupled with strong electron–donor characteristics12 facilitates charge transport within G molecules.13,14 In addition, three H-bond acceptor (N7, N3, and O6) and two H-bond donor (N1 and N2) sites simultaneously behave as Brønsted acid and base
and exhibit an exquisite internal H-bonded motif.15 Also, G-rich moieties demonstrate a high propensity to
fold into hierarchical motifs and self-assembled nanostructures like
quadruplex (G4’s),16 honeycomb arrangements,
nanowires,17 and sheetlike structures.18−20

In general, the supramolecular self-assembly of functional
molecules
is mitigated in the presence of an inorganic substrate, which serves
as a template for the growth. In most cases, an array of diverse polymorphic
structures is observed and the efficacy of a molecule to a substrate
governs the nature of the molecular orientation and assembly.21,22 The self-assembly of DNA nucleobases and its derivatives on two-dimensional
(2D) substrates like graphene,23 highly
ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG),24−26 MoS2,25,27 hexagonal BN (h-BN),28,29 Au (111),30,31 and SrTiO3 (100)32 substrates
has been reported.33 Scanning tunneling
microscopy imaging of the ordering of G nucleobases on MoS2 reveals distinct isolated structureless blobs with parallel rows
of alternating intermolecular H-bridge bonds.28 An anisotropic patterned assembly of single- and double-stranded
DNA on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) was ascribed to the donor–acceptor
interactions, wherein electric dipole and van der Waals (vdW) coupling
facilitates the charge transfer between DNA and GNRs.34 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of G molecules on
freshly cleaved HOPG35 showed that G molecules
condense in small nuclei without the formation of an ordered assembly.
Likewise, molecular packing of adenine on a (0001) graphite surface
was found to be commensurate with the graphite surface.36 In contrast to the preferential π-stacking
on graphene, the ionic nature of the h-BN sheet results in stronger
bioconjugated complexes with high sensitivity toward the DNA/RNA nucleobases.28,29

Graphene is a versatile 2D nanomaterial and an ideal candidate
for the fabrication of novel biointegrated structures,37 due to its atomically flat surface together
with unique physical, optical, and electronic properties. In our recent
theoretical work based on the dispersion-corrected density functional
theory (DFT-D2), we highlighted the role of graphene in stabilizing
the physisorption of Gn bases.38 We have demonstrated a substrate-induced structural
transition in Gn bases and a preference
of alignment over the stacked configurations on graphene. Realizing
that first-principles calculations were limited to a small number
of bases along with the fact that the solvation effect was treated
via the implicit polarizable continuum model, we consider a larger
set of Gn oligomers, thereby replicating
the properties at longer length/time scales. Herein, with the help
of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we investigate the self-assembly
of free-standing noncanonical Gn nucleobases
and the role of graphene in mediating the monolayer self-assembly
of the bases as a function of the surface coverage. Specifically,
our goal is to elucidate the crossover mechanism of base–base
and base–substrate interactions that will help establish systematic
pathways toward realizing molecular recognition and self-assembly
under the given physiological conditions.

Results and Discussion
Self-Assembly
of Gn Bases with n =
2–6
Figure 1 depicts the snapshots of free-standing Gn bases in the gas phase. Conformational flexibility
and the availability of donor/acceptor sites within the G base facilitate
multiple modes of interaction, wherein the bases tend to aggregate,
stabilized predominantly by intermolecular H-bonds, as shown in Figure 1a. The diad configuration
is predicted to be nonplanar, whereas the triad configuration stabilizes
in a semicage-like structure through bifurcated and intermolecular
H-bonds. The quartet, pentad, and hexad configurations are stabilized
via intermolecular H-bonds, and an increase in the number of homomers
leads to aggregation (clustering) of the bases. The calculated binding
energy, defined as the difference in the potential energy between
the system and the constituents, increases with the number of bases,
although the binding energy/base attains saturation from G4 onward, suggesting a net stabilization of Gn complexes (Figure 1b).

Figure 1 (a) Snapshots of Gn bases (for n = 2–6) and (b) binding energy and binding energy/base
of Gn bases in the gas phase.

The snapshots of free-standing Gn bases
in solvent (Figure 2a) illustrate a disruption of intermolecular H-bonds within the base
pairs; in the diad configuration, the bases are randomly dispersed
with no preference for dimerization. With an increase in the number
of bases, noncovalent π–π interactions lead to
the stacked configurations, as highlighted by the black circles in Figure 2a, via the formation
of a water hydration sphere around the bases. A close observation
of the arrangement of water molecules around a guanine suggests a
uniform ordering of water dipoles, and a maximum of nine water molecules
constitute the first hydration sphere (Figure 2c,d) at an average H-bond distance of ∼1.90
Å. As water is a polar molecule with a high dielectric constant
of 79.36, it introduces electrostatic screening of H-bonded interactions
between the bases, thereby leading to the preference for π stacking
in the solvent.

Figure 2 (a) Solvent-phase snapshots of Gn (for n = 2–6) bases, (b, c) water hydration
sphere and
ordering of water molecules along the guanine molecule, and (d) approximately
nine water molecules constituting the first water hydration sphere.

The number of H-bonds further
supports the extent of H-bonded interactions
stabilizing the Gn complexes in gas and
solvent phases. The diad configuration is stabilized by two H-bonds
(Figure S1, shown in green), as also predicted
by the dispersion-corrected DFT results.38 With an increase in the number of bases, the H-bond count increases
to a maximum of seven for the hexad configuration in the gas phase,
whereas the disruption of the intermolecular H-bond is substantiated
in the solvent (Figure S1, shown in red).
In gas phase, the average intermolecular H-bond distance is calculated
to be <2.0 Å (Figure S2), although
a fluctuation in the intermolecular H-bond distance is observed for
the triad configuration. The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) demonstrates
significant fluctuation over the trajectory in the solvent compared
to that in the gas phase (Figure S3) and
can be accounted to the conformational variations within the Gn complexes (average RMSD is calculated to be
<1.5 Å).

To provide a detailed understanding on the
nature of molecular
aggregation and self-assembly of free-standing Gn bases, we extended the simulation to larger Gn bases, namely, G12 and G36, as discussed in the following section.

Self-Assembly of G12 and G36 Bases
In the gas phase, the
free-standing G12 bases aggregate
in a cagelike structure stabilized by intermolecular H-bonds along
the outer cage and π stacking along the core, as depicted in Figure S4a. It is important to note that approximately
nine G bases constitute the intermolecular H-bonded network within
the cage structure (Figure S4b). The average
binding energy and binding energy/base for G12 in the gas
phase are calculated to be −13.2 and −1.1 eV, respectively.
In the solvent, the preference for π–π stacking
between the bases with a disruption of intermolecular H-bonds is highlighted
(Figure S4c).

The RMSD suggests an
overall stability of the G12 configuration, with the normalized
RMSD values of ∼2.2 and ∼1.3 Å in the gas phase
and the solvent, respectively (Figure S5a). In the solvent, fluctuations in RMSD over the trajectory are attributed
to the random orientations and disruption of intermolecular interactions
between the G12 bases. Similar to the trends observed in Figure 1, self-assembly of
G12 leads to an increased H-bond count (average of ∼12
H-bonds in the gas phase), whereas in the solvent, the disruption
of intermolecular H-bonds leads to a reduced H-bond count of 1–2
(Figure S5b).

The radial distribution
function (RDF) serves as a valuable tool
to compute the nearest neighbors and the formation of water hydration
spheres around G bases. The RDF between the oxygen atom of water molecules
and the G base (red spline) depicts two characteristic peaks, one
below 2.0 Å (peak 1) and the other close to 4.0 Å (peak
2), corresponding to the two ordered water hydration spheres. In the
total RDF (green spline), contributions from the H-atom (black spline)
overlay with the combined system (Figure S5c).

Likewise, the G36 bases aggregate in a highly
compact
network like G12, stabilized via π–π
stacking along the core and intermolecular H-bonds along the outer
cage in the gas phase (Figure 3a). We find that an increase in the number of bases facilitates
an enhanced interaction within the complex, with binding energy and
binding energy/base of −46.65 and −1.30 eV, respectively.
In the solvent, screening of the intermolecular interactions leads
to the formation of distinct π–π stacked domains
(black circles in Figure 3b) and ∼17 water molecules constitute the water hydration
sphere around the stacked bases (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 Snapshots of G36 bases in (a) gas
phase and (b) solvent.
(c) Schematic illustration of the water hydration sphere and ordering
along the three stacked bases.

To substantiate the two modes of noncovalent interaction
stabilizing
the G36 configuration, we compared the dynamic evolution
of π–π and intermolecular H-bond distances, as
illustrated in Figure 4a. The average π-stacking distance between the base pairs is
calculated to be approximately 3.5–4.0 Å. It is important
to note that for the first 10 ns, no π stacking between the
bases was realized (Figure 4a, shown in blue), as most of the bases that have aggregated
are stabilized by an intermolecular H-bonded network. The average
intermolecular H-bond distance is <2.5 Å, which falls within
the intermolecular H-bond regime. The results agree with our previously
reported dispersion-corrected DFT-D2 calculations, where the average
intermolecular H-bond distance in Gn bases
was calculated to be approximately 1.8–1.9 Å.38

intermolecular
H-bond distances in gas phase, (b) normalized RMSD, (c) number of
H-bonds, and (d) normalized center of mass (COM) distance of G36 bases in gas and solvent phases.

The evolution in the structure and conformational stability
of
G36 bases can be considered from the analysis of the normalized
RMSD over the trajectory, as depicted in Figure 4b. In the gas phase, the two break points
around 5 and 10 ns (shown in green) are correlated to the change in
the configuration, in which the tail portion of G36 assembles
to a completely globular network beyond 10 ns. The RMSD in the solvent
increases in the beginning and then saturates around ∼1.0 Å,
suggesting an overall stability of the system. The average H-bond
count of ∼23 in the gas phase reduces to ∼2 in the solvent,
which substantiates to the substantial screening of intermolecular
bonds by water molecules (Figure 4c). In the gas phase, the normalized COM remains nearly
constant at ∼0.35, with no structural variation (Figure 4d), whereas in the solvent,
substantial fluctuations in the COM is attributed to the random dispersion
of the bases.

Figure 5a illustrates
the pairwise RDF of O–H, O–O, and H–H bonds in
water molecules, and the inset depicts the RDF profile of water simulation
in the absence of G molecules. The corresponding RDF of the solvated
system is shown in Figure 5b, wherein the RDF of the O–H bond at 1.0 Å corresponds
to the calculated O–H bond length in water. Likewise, the H–H
(O–O) bond length is calculated to be 1.6 (2.75) Å, which
is in excellent agreement with the reported RDF of TIP3P water using
the CHARMM force field.39 In the combined
system (Figure 5b),
the RDF of the oxygen atom of G bases depicts two characteristic peaks,
one at ∼1.8 Å (peak 1) and the other close to 4.0 Å
(peak 2), which correspond to the two ordered hydration spheres. The
H-atom contributions to the total RDF overlays with the combined system
(black spline). The RDF of G36 in the gas and solvent phases
is provided in Figure S6a,b.

Self-Assembly of Gn Bases on Graphene
with n = 6, 12, and 36
The dynamics of Gn bases in the presence of graphene was considered
to elucidate the role of the substrate in regulating the monolayer
assembly, as the free-standing bases prefer to aggregate (cluster)
rather than form a self-assembled monolayer. The snapshots of Gn/graphene complexes (for n =
6, 12, and 36) in the gas phase demonstrate the monolayer assembly
on graphene, stabilized primarily by the base–base intermolecular
H-bonds and base–graphene π-stacking interactions (Figure 6a–c). At a
low surface coverage (i.e., for n = 6 and 12), the
bases are aligned in a linear array, whereas at a high surface coverage
(i.e., n = 36), the bases aggregate in a highly condensed
network with no well-defined patterned array. The polar nature of
G molecules coupled with the possibility of interaction via donor/acceptor
sites facilitates myriad polymorphic arrangements within the complex,
as described by the arrow notation corresponding to the dipole orientation
in Figure 6d–f.
Notably, we observed the G-quartet domains within the base alignment,
as illustrated in the top images of Figure 6a–c.

Figure 6 (a–c) Snapshots of Gn bases
(n = 6, 12, and 36) adsorbed on graphene monolayer
in gas phase. (d–f) Dipole alignment of G molecules.

In the solvent, screening of the
intermolecular bonds by water
molecules leads to a high degree of immobilization of the bases on
graphene (Figure 7a).
With an increase in the number of physisorbed bases, aggregation leads
to base dimerization, overcoming the base–water dipolar interactions,
and the base–substrate π–π stacking predominates
the base–base intermolecular interactions (Figure 7b). The interplanar distance
between graphene and Gn bases is calculated
to be ∼3.4 Å, which agrees with the reported π-stacking
distance of aromatic molecules adsorbed on graphene.40,41 For the G36/graphene complex (Figure 7c), an increase in the number of homomers
facilitates intermolecular H-bonded interactions along graphene. Given
the fact that G bases can exhibit multiple interacting modes facilitated
by the acceptor–donor sites along with the competing steric
hindrance induced by the water molecules, random dispersions were
observed with a reduced affinity between the bases, especially at
a low surface coverage.

(d–f) Dipole alignment of G molecules.

The interaction energy of Gn/graphene
complexes together with variations in the corresponding vdW and electrostatic
energies is depicted in Figure S7a–c. For a single guanine nucleobase adsorbed on graphene, the interaction
energies in the gas and solvent phases are calculated to be −0.25
and −0.77 eV, respectively. The free-standing Gn bases in the gas phase have a comparatively higher
interaction energy than the bases adsorbed on graphene. At the level
of dispersion-corrected DFT, a similar trend in the interaction energy
was predicted for free-standing and graphene-supported Gn bases. With an increase in the number of bases physisorbed
on graphene, the interaction energy is calculated to be about −0.5
eV in the gas phase, whereas in the solvent, it increases to about
−7.0 to −11.3 eV, which may be attributed to the water
molecules stabilizing the adsorption of Gn complexes on graphene and favors base–base dimerization over
base–base aggregation into clusters in the gas phase. Thus,
graphene facilitates the monolayer dispersion of the Gn bases in the gas and solvent phases, as opposed
to the self-aggregation of free-standing bases in the gas phase and
π-stacked domains in the solvent. The vdW energy increases as
a function of the surface coverage (Figure S7b) due to the increase in the π–π stacking interactions
with an increase in the number of molecules. On the other hand, the
electrostatic energy decreases with an increase in the surface coverage
(Figure S7c), suggesting an enhanced intermolecular
H-bonded interaction and a net weakening of the electrostatic interactions
between the Gn bases at a high surface
coverage. The base–base stacking interaction energy and the
base–substrate interaction energy have been investigated at
the level of DFT42,43,38 and ab initio MD simulation.44 At the
level of dispersion-corrected DFT,38 we
have discussed that in the presence of explicit waters base–base
stacking is energetically favored over the aligned configuration,
with more water molecules solvating the bases with the formation of
water hydration spheres in the former configuration. This implied
that graphene helps to disperse the guanine bases and favors the monolayer-aligned
configuration over the stacked mode of adsorption.

The normalized
RMSD values for G6/graphene and G12/graphene
in the gas and solvent phases were further compared,
as depicted in Figure S8. In the gas phase,
the RMSD of G12/graphene shows a break at ∼38 ns,
which is associated with the reorientation of G12 on graphene,
as shown in the adjoining schematic of Figure S8b. In the solvent, the average RMSD is calculated to be <1.5
Å, and screening of the intermolecular interactions by water
molecules results in random fluctuations over the trajectory. The
average RMSD of G36/graphene at <1.0 Å (Figure 8a) suggests a higher
degree of stability introduced by graphene, signifying the substrate-induced
self-assembly of the bases at a high surface coverage. For free-standing
G36 bases and in G36/graphene in the solvent
phase, the normalized RMSD of about 1 Å suggests that the base–base
self-aggregation in free standing is likely in the solvent phase for
a higher number of bases and that the bases assume to aggregate in
stacked configurations. In the presence of graphene, monolayer adsorption
of the G36 bases facilitates the base–base aggregation
in an aligned configuration on graphene, whereas, at a highly saturated
base coverage, the base–base aggregation is mediated via both
aligned and stacked configurations.

Figure 8 (a) Normalized RMSD for G36/graphene in gas (green)
and solvent (red) phases, (b) RDF of G36/graphene and the
constituents in solvent, (c) mass density profile of water molecules
along graphene, and (d) extrapolation of the inset in (c) depicting
a cross section of the orientation of water molecules on graphene.

The number of H-bonds in the Gn/graphene
complex increases with an increase in the number of physisorbed bases,
as shown in Figure S10. Relative to the
cases of free-standing Gn bases (Figures 1 and 2), the increase in the H-bond count suggests that the incorporation
of graphene facilitates the base aggregation in both gas and solvent
phases. For example, the presence of graphene leads to an increased
H-bond count, with an average of ∼5 and ∼10 H-bonds
for G12/graphene and G36/graphene, respectively,
compared to an average of 1–2 H-bonds for the free-standing
counterparts. The simulation results thereby suggest a correlation
of the extent of surface coverage density on the overall stability
and self-assembly/aggregation of Gn bases
on graphene.

High Surface Coverage of G Bases on Graphene:
G72/Graphene
The high surface coverage simulated
with 72 bases
was considered to provide additional insights into the competitive
interactions that govern the self-assembly process. It is important
to note that, at a highly saturated surface coverage, molecular and
steric constraints in the packing of G polymorphs render stacking
patterns between the bases in addition to the aligned configurations,
as illustrated in the snapshot in Figure 9a. We find that ∼48 bases can fully
saturate the graphene surface, as depicted in Figure 9b, and apart from the monolayer assembly,
π stacking between the bases is observed for the bases not in
close proximity of graphene. An enhanced H-bond stabilization is observed
with an average of ∼18 H-bonds between the bases (Figure 9d). The RMSD of G72/graphene suggests an overall stability of the system in
the solvent at an average value below 1.25 Å, as depicted in Figure S11a. The average H-bond distance between
the bases is calculated to be ∼2.0 Å, which correlates
well with the intermolecular H-bond distance in free-standing Gn bases, whereas the π-stacked distance
between the base and the substrate is ∼3.55 Å (Figure S11b).

Figure 9 Snapshots of G72/graphene in
solvent: (a) side view,
(b) front view, and (c) dipole alignment of the G bases. (d) Number
of H-bonds and (e) normalized COM between graphene and G bases in
G36/graphene and G72/graphene complexes.

A comparison of the normalized
COM in the G36/graphene
and G72/graphene complexes is shown in Figure 9e. The fluctuations in G36/graphene at an average value of 1.25 can be attributed to
the conformational flexibility in orientations of guanine bases physisorbed
on graphene. On the other hand, a highly saturated surface corresponding
to G72/graphene exhibits a nearly constant COM throughout
the trajectory at around 1.0. This is because an almost complete surface
coverage of graphene restrains the free rattling of the physisorbed
bases. Relative to a high degree of fluctuations in COM for free-standing
Gn bases (Figure 4d), the presence of a graphene substrate
also mitigates base–base intermolecular interactions, thereby
stabilizing the molecular assembly, especially at a high surface coverage
in the solvent.

To understand the energetics of the base–base
stacking interaction
and the base–substrate interaction for Gn/graphene, calculations were using the vdW dispersion-corrected
DFT.38 In these calculations, G2 base was taken to represent the case of a lower surface coverage
on graphene. The gas-phase interaction energies of the stacked and
aligned G2 bases on graphene were calculated to be −1.04
and −1.72 eV, respectively. The DFT results therefore suggest
preference for the aligned base configurations on graphene, wherein
the aligned geometries facilitate a maximum π-orbital overlap
associated with the interacting moieties. It is important to note
that the gas-phase interaction energies of the free-standing G2 bases in the stacked and aligned configurations are calculated
to be −1.01 and 1.48 eV, respectively. The MD results are therefore
in agreement with the DFT results for the low surface coverage of
the bases on graphene.

The preference of Gn bases to assimilate
in disordered aggregates with no well-defined arrays on the monolayer
graphene agrees with previous AFM studies of Gn bases adsorbed on HOPG in the presence of water solvent
media at high and fully saturated surface coverages.35 The preference of the bases to assimilate in disordered
aggregates on the monolayer graphene is also in agreement with the
observed stacked polymeric arrays of G bases on the underlying Au(111)
substrate.45,46 Our simulation results predict
distinctive trends under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and in water
solvent media, suggesting that the solvent polarity (polar vs nonpolar)
contributing to the dipolar interactions between water/G bases and
water molecules renders conformational flexibility toward the assembly
process. Free-standing graphene with its inherent rippling characteristics
determines the nature of the assembly and flexibility of G bases to
adopt various polymorphs and packing structures, as opposed to forming
perfectly aligned arrays on the HOPG substrate. Although graphene
mitigates the monolayer assembly of G bases, the formation of disordered
aggregates especially in solvent phase can be described as a collective
noncovalent interaction of intermolecular H-bond, π–π
stacking, cooperative, and hydrophobic interactions in predicting
the molecular stability and self-assembly at the solid/liquid interface.

Summary
The self-assembly of free-standing and graphene-supported
noncanonical
Gn nucleobases is investigated by employing
the MD simulation method. We find that the molecular aggregation and
self-assembly are governed by the interplay of the base–base
and base–substrate interactions. The base–substrate
interactions mainly determine the formation of the self-assembled
monolayer on graphene, whereas the base–base interactions govern
the nature of aggregation of the free-standing G molecules.

In the gas phase, the free-standing Gn bases prefer to aggregate, stabilized by intermolecular H-bond and
π-stacking interactions along the core. In the solvent, the
stacking mode is preferred due to screening of the intermolecular
interactions. The substrate-induced effect is substantial in driving
the monolayer assembly, thereby regulating the growth and stabilization
of the bases. The Gn bases adopt random
dispersion on graphene, rendered from the inherent polarity and the
availability of donor/acceptor sites facilitating myriad polymorphic
arrangements. In the solvent, a high degree of immobilization of the
bases on graphene occurs at a low surface coverage. On the other hand,
at a high surface coverage, steric constraints in the packing of Gn polymorphs render stacking patterns between
the bases in addition to the monolayer coverage, competing with the
water molecules toward the self-assembly on graphene. In the solvent,
the preference of Gn bases to assimilate
in disordered aggregates with no well-defined arrays on graphene agrees
well with previous AFM studies of Gn bases
adsorbed on HOPG. The calculated results help provide a comprehensive
yet succinct understanding of the dominant interactions governing
the self-assembly of free-standing noncanonical Gn nucleobases and the role of the 2D material substrate toward
realizing self-assembled hierarchical structural motifs. The future
direction which we foresee is the application of the assembled heterostructures
as templates for the growth and fabrication of DNA-based sensors,
sequencing of DNA oligonucleotides, translocation through nanopores,
and in DNA-based nanoelectronic devices.

Computational Details
The MD simulations were performed using the isothermal–isobaric
(NPT) and NVT ensembles in both gas (vacuum) and solvent phases using
the NAMD code.47 The all-atom CHARMM27
force field48 was employed for graphene,
which includes bonded and nonbonded parameters.49 The simulations were performed at room temperature (298.15
K) using the Langevin dynamics, and the Langevin piston Nosé–Hoover
method was employed to maintain the pressure at 101.3 kPa. The particle
mesh Ewald50 summation was used to calculate
the periodic electrostatic interactions with a long-range cutoff of
12.0 Å. For the solvent phase, the water molecules were represented
by the TIP3P water, with constraints applied to the bond lengths and
angles of the water molecules using the SETTLE algorithm. Except for
the water molecules, all other atoms were relaxed during the simulation
to capture the dynamics of interaction.

The free-standing Gn bases (for n = 2–6,
12, and 36) were simulated in a periodic
supercell of (50 × 50 × 50) Å3. Calculations
incorporated 2000 steps of energy minimization using the conjugate
gradient algorithm, followed by 1.5 ns of production run in the gas
and solvent phases using the NVT and NPT ensembles, respectively.
For larger Gn homomers (i.e., n = 12 and 36), we proceeded with 50 ns of the production
run in the gas and solvent phases, with the other variables remaining
unchanged, to have a detailed understanding on the dynamic evolution
of molecular complexes. It has been previously established that MD
simulations with time scales of ∼50 ns are sufficient to attain
stable molecular complexes for similar systems in both gas and solvent
phases.51

The graphene sheet was
constructed in a periodic supercell having
a dimension of (61.6 × 62.4) Å2 comprising 1500
carbon atoms. The MD simulation of the Gn/graphene complex incorporated 2000 steps of energy minimization,
followed by 50 ns of production run at a timestep of 1.0 fs. In the
solvent, we also performed simulated annealing with a gradual increment
of temperature from 298 to 700 K at an interval of 50 K and quenching
the complex to 298 K with a decrement interval of 50 K. To determine
the preferred orientation of the adsorption of G bases on graphene,
we considered both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the
adsorption. Quite interestingly, the Gn bases that were initially aligned perpendicular at ∼7 Å
away from the graphene basal plane reverted to a parallel stacked
configuration within 1 ns of the simulation, suggesting the preference
for interaction via a parallel stacked mode.

The convergence
of the simulation in terms of the measure of the
variation of the average distance between the atoms was examined by
analyzing the RMSD over the trajectory. For the last 1 ns of the 50
ns trajectory, additional components of the analysis, namely, the
RDF, normalized COM distance between the Gn bases, Gn/graphene, and water density
profile, were calculated. The RMSD is an indicator of the overall
stability of the system over the trajectory, and a uniform RMSD suggests
no major fluctuations in the system. The RDF or the pair correlation
function denoted by g(r) represents
the correlation between atom pairs or the probability to find an atom
at a distance r from another atom chosen as the reference.
At short distances (less than atomic diameter), the value of g(r) is zero, which corresponds to the
strong repulsive forces. The first large peak demonstrates the likeliness
of two molecules to be found at this separation. At long distances, g(r) approaches the value of one, which
indicates that there is no long-range order. The number of H-bonds
was calculated with the help of the VMD52 plugin over the trajectory between the Gn bases. The number of H-bonds provides a qualitative estimate of
the average number of H-bonds stabilizing the Gn configurations in the gas and solvent phases. The normalized
RMSD, RDF, and COM plots were obtained using the VMD plugin. GaussView
within the Gaussian09 suite of programs and VMD were utilized to construct
the initial configurations of Gn bases,
graphene, and Gn/graphene complexes.

The interaction energy of the Gn/graphene
complex was calculated using a two-box method, given by 1  where Eclose and Eaway are the potential energies corresponding
to the configurations of Gn/graphene when
Gn molecules are close and away from graphene
surface, respectively. The away configuration mimics an isolated system,
where Gn bases are about ∼30 Å
separated from graphene.
