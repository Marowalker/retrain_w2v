The drying of nanocolloidal
polymers is governed by the interplay
among surface tension, evaporation, and contact-line pinning, among
other phenomena. Here, we describe the sequential evolution of poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) through two distinct regimes evidenced by annular
or radial cracking and show that the cracking dynamics and solvent-retention
postdrying and postcracking are mediated by wetting to the substrate
surface. The corresponding changes in the PEDOT:PSS morphology are
also observed to relate to the radial or cracking dynamics. It is
suggested that the wetting-dependent effect offers a route to control
morphology, understand solvent retention, and reduce cracking in polymer
latex films. This study highlights the importance of substrate choice,
an underexplored area of investigation in the study of colloidal materials.

Introduction
Cracking phenomena are observed in practically
every colloidal
solid, from the largest mudflats1 to small
blood traces in medical diagnosis2 to the
almost-microscopic trails deposited in inkjet printing.3,4 Most interest in cracking behavior aims to eliminate cracks to improve
electrical,5 optical,6 or other material performance, but the same dynamics can
also be harnessed as a tool for self-assembly, for example, toward
large-area transparent conductive nanostructures.7 This study describes crack patterns observed in dropcast
poly-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)
toward improved lab-to-lab repeatability and predictive control of
the complex polymer dynamics. The aim of this study is to provide
a cogent description of the trends to mediate the surface dynamics
and point to morphological issues related to surface wetting. We intend
to advance specific understanding of this conducting polymer and to
contribute to the study of colloidal drying in general.

There
are several useful properties of PEDOT:PSS, including high
electrical conductivity,8 good optical
transparency,9 mechanical flexibility,10 and coating stability over time.11 Moreover, because PEDOT:PSS films simultaneously
exhibit high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity,
progress is being made in the application of PEDOT:PSS as a thermoelectric
material.10,12 Cracking behavior compromises these useful
properties. Internal stresses built up during the drying process also
reduce material performance, even if cracking does not occur.13−15 This study examines the accumulation of tensile and compressive
stresses at different points in the drying process, mediated by the
contact angle with the substrate.

Specific cracking and deposition
phenomena have been identified
in drying colloids.16−19 Research continues to investigate both basic drying mechanisms and
the effects the drying process has on the properties of the resulting
film.17,19−23 One of the most intensively studied is the coffee-ring
effect,17,23−25 in which solids are
deposited in a ring when the contact line between the droplet and
the substrate is pinned. As a result of this pinning, liquid flows
toward the outer edge of the droplet to replace the liquid lost through
evaporation, carrying with it the suspended particles.24

The Marangoni flow is another well-known
effect: a concentration
or temperature gradient within a droplet leads to a surface energy
gradient, resulting in fluid flow toward the region of higher surface
tension. This effect has been found to oppose and even reverse the
coffee-ring effect to yield a film with maximum thickness at the center.26 The interplay between the coffee-ring and Marangoni
effects is not yet fully understood.17,24,26,27

Colloids have
been found to dry in a four-stage process,21 with flow effects like those mentioned above
dominating in the “submerged phase”. During the “wet”
and “moist” phases, after the liquid has receded below
the level of the solid material surface, drying behavior is largely
determined by capillary forces on the solid–liquid interfaces.21,28 In this paper, we clearly observe the existence of the submerged
and wet phases in a drying colloid. We characterize the cracks that
form in each phase both on the centimeter scale and by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).

One important type of colloid is the latex
(plural: lattices),
defined as an aqueous colloidal dispersion of polymer particles.4 It is a conductive polymer latex that is studied
in this paper. Lattices have a number of advantages compared to other
polymer forms for industrial applications: they can be processed at
room temperature and using a variety of inexpensive processes, including
inkjet printing,3 silkscreening,12 and spin-coating.29 Using aqueous dispersions also avoids the safety and health issues
associated with volatile organic solvents.4 Many different polymers can be produced in latex form by emulsion
polymerization.4 Nanoparticle lattices
are particularly exciting because they allow for nanomaterial self-assembly,
using simple bottom-up processes.30 Nanoparticle
lattices have been used to generate plasmonic nanomaterials,31 photonic crystals,32 and various kinds of metamaterials.33 PEDOT:PSS is one of the most widely used conducting polymers, in
part because it is available as a latex and therefore has the processing
advantages described above.11 Nanopatterned
PEDOT:PSS films have already shown some promise as photonic materials34,35 and as improved anodes for solar cells.36 Our knowledge of the self-assembly dynamics of PEDOT:PSS nanostructures
advances the feasibility of nanotechnology in optical and electronics
applications.

In this paper, we report on the drying behavior
observed in dropcast
PEDOT:PSS films, on glass slides and on flexible polymer substrates.
The different wetting properties of the substrate surfaces are found
to have a strong effect on the evaporation and film formation processes.
The percentage mass lost after drying is found to be lower on less
wettable surfaces, indicating higher water retention. Annular and
radial cracking regimes are observed. Annular cracks are found to
predominate on the more wettable glass substrate and at higher evaporation
rates. Radial cracks, propagating from the edge of the film to the
center, are found to dominate on the polymer substrate and in thicker
films. The radial cracks are hypothesized to be the result of mud-cracking
when the film thickness exceeds the maximum crack-free thickness (hmax). The annular cracks are attributed to the
stick-slip motion of a pinned contact edge.

We provide several
guides relevant to crack prevention in PEDOT:PSS
films during colloidal deposition: higher temperatures and humidities
are found to prevent annular cracking; film thickness, which varies
with contact angle, mediates the cracking, particularly with high
thicknesses; and radial cracking occurs largely with high contact
angles. Modification of the substrate surface and alteration of the
drying conditions are feasible techniques for altering or preventing
cracking behavior. Corresponding differences in the PEDOT:PSS morphology
are also observed with varied drying dynamics. The dependence of cracking
on wetting shows the importance of substrate choice in colloidal deposition
experiments, an underexplored factor in self-assembly investigations.

Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
a subset of the crack patterns observed in dropcast PEDOT:PSS films. Figure 1a–c are prepared
under ambient conditions, whereas Figure 1(d) is dried in vacuum. The evolution of
these patterns and stress dynamics associated with surface wetting
will be described in the Summary and Conclusions Section. The cracks propagate distinctly: the radial cracks are
first seen near the film edge and propagate toward the center, whereas
the annular cracks propagate around the film at a consistent distance
from the film edge: 4.3 ± 0.8 mm. The width of the outer deposit
is found not to vary with the overall film radius.

and drying rates, illustrating (a) radial, (b) radial and annular,
(c) annular, and (d) concentric annular striping patterns. Droplet
profiles on (e) poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) substrate (contact angle:

Evaporation rate data and time-lapse
images obtained for distinctly
radial and circular cracking processes are shown in Figure 2. Insets show the representative
propagation of cracks on more than two dozen film samples. Cracks
occur at short intervals in the evaporation curve. Drying occurs more
rapidly on the more wettable substrate: droplets deposited on glass
reach equilibrium after approximately 180 min, whereas similarly sized
droplets deposited on vinyl reach equilibrium after 270 min. The substrates
also influence the moisture content retained: the total mass loss
is lower when the samples are deposited on vinyl substrate as compared
to that on glass: 58 versus 97% for the plotted samples. Higher moisture
retention is attributed to the lower surface-area-to-volume ratio
of the droplets at higher contact angles. The thicker film may also
result in an outer, dried layer, which seals the film surface, preventing
further evaporation.

Figure 2 Plot of evaporation mass loss rate versus percent mass
loss for
the annular (blue) and radial (red) cracking processes. Inset: images
illustrating the annular and radial cracking processes. Notice that
the cracks form at different regions of the evaporation curve.

In the case of radial cracking,
the evaporation rate or mass flux
curve exhibits two distinct regimes. Initially, the mass flux decreases
linearly with time as the liquid volume decreases. In a second stage,
there is a rapid drop in the evaporation mass flux, which we observe
in the radially cracked samples after 55% drying (Figure 2). When the film reaches equilibrium
with its environment, the mass flux drops to 0. Time-lapse images
of this sample show macroscopic contractions of the liquid meniscus
between the initial deposition time and 55% drying (225 min). The
meniscus then recedes beneath the surface of the deposited polymer
film, and cracks propagate from the edge of the film to the center.
These stages are consistent with the submerged, wet/moist, and “dry”
phases of a drying latex film described by Roberts and Francis.21

The trend in the mass loss rate for circular
cracking is discontinuous,
with roughly linear periods of drying punctuated by sudden drops in
the mass loss rate. The sharp drops in mass loss rate occur when the
contact lines move. A steep fall is seen after 90% drying, corresponding
to the contraction of the meniscus to the surface of the solid film.
The circular cracks form earlier in the drying process than do the
radial cracks. The circular cracking process is not observed at temperatures
above 22 °C or at humidities above 85%.

A comparison of
the radial and annular cracks under SEM (Figures 3 and 4) crucially
reveals differing polymer morphologies associated
with the two cracking processes. The radial cracks, which occur on
a more hydrophobic surface, appear as sharp discontinuities in a thick
polymer film. In contrast, the circular cracks, formed on a more hydrophilic
surface, exhibit a thin PEDOT:PSS film separating two thicker films
around a circular crack. The high-magnification image in Figure 3 shows a distinct
granularity to the radially cracked film, with flattened PEDOT:PSS
grains, which is not apparent in the high-magnification image in Figure 4 with the circularly
cracked PEDOT:PSS.

in orange and green). Note the sharp edges of the PEDOT:PSS, the thickness
of the film compared to that of the other sample, and the strained
PEDOT:PSS grains visible on the edges of the film under high magnification.

along
with a photograph showing the location of the SEM images (highlighted
in orange and green). The gradual diminution of the PEDOT:PSS film
thickness in these cracks is in contrast with the sharp edges of the
film in Figure 3. Note,
also, that shrinkage cracking has caused partial delamination of the
thinner film. The dark region in the top left of the central image
is an artifact of the SEM instrument. Scale bars from left: 2 cm,
1 mm, and 200 μm.

In analyzing these results, we describe the evolution of
the radial
and annular cracks as separate processes and relate these processes
to the results described above. We connect our investigation with
prior work and conclude with a description of the crack patterns shown
in Figure 1. Our observations
indicate that radial cracking occurs via shear stress in a more compact,
rigid film, whereas the stress underlying the annular striping occurs
over a longer duration via tension in a more humid and pliable film.
Because the morphology of the PEDOT:PSS grains is influenced by polymer
stress far before cracking, our investigation shows different nonlinear
regimes of stress in the polymer film that are solely influenced by
substrate or surface wetting, which deserves further study.

The radial cracking process is a strain-limited process, as illustrated
in Figure 5. As the
meniscus of the droplet contracts, the polymer particles are displaced
by van der Waals and capillary forces and form a random close-packed
structure. As the meniscus contracts further, capillary forces build
up between the particles. The response of the particles to this force
depends on their shear modulus:28 hard
particles remain in place to form films with significant void fraction,
whereas soft particles deform to occupy the space vacated by the moving
meniscus. Previous studies on PEDOT:PSS structures indicate that soft
particle deformation does occur in the drying of PEDOT:PSS,37,38 where the PSS material merges together to fill voids,39 which we also observe in our SEM images (Figures 3 and 4). Once the particles are strained completely, filling the
void space, the contraction force acts to rupture the film, forming
cracks. Because the meniscus contracts toward the center of the droplet/film,
the particles at the outside edge are the first to deform completely.
Hence, the cracks would be expected to propagate from the edge of
the film toward the center, as we observed in Figure 2. Because the deformation of the particles
reduces the void fraction of the film, the moist and wet phases are
less distinct than in a film composed of hard particles.21

Figure 5 Illustration of the radial cracking process. (a) Meniscus
contracts
through evaporation. PEDOT:PSS particles are closely packed by capillary
forces (direction indicated by orange arrows). (b) When the area of
the meniscus can no longer be reduced by particle motion, the particles
deform as the meniscus contracts. (c) Particles toward the edges of
the film deform completely, reaching the strain limit if the film
thickness exceeds the critical cracking thickness. Yellow arrows show
the direction of propagation. (d) Cracks emerge and propagate around
the surface of the film to relieve capillary stress.

Figure 6 Illustration of the circular-ring formation process. (a)
Initial
equilibrium droplet has a low contact angle. (b) Evaporation leads
to diminishing droplet volume. Because the contact line is pinned,
this manifests as a flattening of the droplet from the equilibrium
shape. Polymer particles deposit at the contact edge. Marangoni flows
(orange curves) compete with the particle motion due to the coffee-ring
effect (red arrows). (c) Surface-area-to-volume ratio increases with
flattening, and the surface energy (green) that opposes the pinning
force (red) increases. (d) Surface energy acting on the contact edge
exceeds the pinning force. The contact line contracts to a new position
with the same initial contact angle. As the contact line contracts,
PEDOT:PSS particles are deposited on the substrate to form a thin
film. (e) Coffee-ring effect and Marangoni flow again predominate
in the central droplet, whereas the dryer outer edge is now in the
wet drying phase. It is possible for the contact line to depin again,
forming concentric rings (Figure 1d). (f) Contraction of the thick outer and inner films
produces stress on the thin film. (g) Thin film ruptures and yields
an annular crack. Shrinkage may result in a contorted, delaminated
film (Figure 4).

By understanding the competing
dynamics, radial cracking may be
reduced by controlling the drying conditions, like temperature and
humidity, or changing the substrate wetting, which affect the coffee-ring
and Marangoni effects and subsequently limit the film thickness. A
relation for the critical cracking thickness of low-shear-modulus
particle lattices is derived by Tirumkudulu and Russel28,40 1  where γ is the liquid surface
tension, G is the shear modulus of the particles,
and M and ϕrcp are, respectively,
the coordination number
and particle volume fraction of spheres in random close packing. Equation 1 indicates the maximum
thickness at which radial cracks are not observed. Radial cracking
dominates in the hydrophobic case because the smaller droplet radius
gives rise to thicker polymer films. The cracks propagate from the
edge to the middle partially because the edge of the film is the thickest,
which is attributed to the coffee-ring effect. Radial cracking can
coexist with circular cracking if the outer ring grows beyond hmax before contact-line depinning occurs. In
this investigation, the film thickness is primarily determined by
substrate–droplet interactions, with higher contact angles
leading to increased droplet heights and therefore thicker films.
Substrate surface modification offers a route for the production of
crack-free dropcast films by modification of the film thickness by
tuning the contact angle. However, our results also show that cracking
can occur in thin films by tension-mediated processes that are not
explained by eq 1, as
seen in the circular cracking and the propagation of radial shrinkage
cracks from thinner parts of the film in Figure 1b.

In contrast to the radial cracking
dynamics, there is not a clear
relation governing pinning and cracking as there is for radial cracking,
that is, eq 1. A few
recent works highlight the importance of drying-mediated dynamics
in annular rings,22,23 and the drying dynamics at the
coffee ring can lead to strong self-assembly. We infer that a new
relation would need to be derived to describe a different cracking
transition, which is observed in Figure 6. We observe that annular cracking is a tension-limited
process and occurs in the submerged phase, as illustrated in Figure 4. The droplet edge
is pinned by frictional forces between the latex and the substrate.
As evaporation occurs, the droplet flattens, increasing the surface
area. The surface energy increases, opposing the pinning force. The
surface energy can eventually exceed the pinning force, resulting
in stick-slip motion of the contact line toward the center. This stick-slip
motion leads to the formation of an annular outer deposit and a circular
inner deposit, connected by a minimal PEDOT:PSS film deposited during
the motion itself. Shrinkage of the inner and outer deposits then
results in the formation of the circular crack. Partial circular cracks
are observed in some samples. This is observed to be the result of
uneven pinning behavior: in some samples, surface contaminants led
to inhomogeneous pinning. In other cases, substrates placed on slightly
sloping surfaces are found to crack preferentially on the elevated
side; gravitational forces can depin the contact line. On the hydrophobic
substrate, the forces of repulsion between the droplet and the surface
are sufficient to prevent pinning, thereby preventing the formation
of circular cracks. The crack spacing is dependent on surface wetting
and increases when the substrate is more hydrophilic. This can be
interpreted from volume conservation considerations.

Summary and Conclusions
We have demonstrated that the radial and annular crack morphologies
are the result of two separate evolving colloidal processes. Both
of these cracking behaviors can occur simultaneously during drying
and depend on droplet morphology and evaporation behavior and therefore
are mediated by the droplet–substrate and droplet–atmosphere
interfaces. Alternately, the environmental parameters such as aggregation
and aging, which influence latex viscosity, can arrest cracking.

The two cracking regimes occur in two different drying phases and
result in different cracking patterns (Figure 1b–d). In Figure 1b, the coffee-ring effect results in the
thickness at the edge that exceeds the maximum crack-free thickness,
where radial shrinkage cracks occur after the formation of an annular
crack.

Figure 1d shows
a film prepared under vacuum. In this case, the stick-slip motion
occurs multiple times, resulting in a concentric structure of alternating
thick and thin stripes. This modulation and the resulting striped
structures may be of interest for the generation of patterned PEDOT:PSS
films. Contact-line pinning results from microscopic surface roughness
on the substrate. The mechanisms of contact-line pinning are yet to
be fully understood.41

Although radial
cracking may be well understood, the annular cracking
behavior is less scrutinized and also less commonly observed; the
interplay between the Marangoni, drying, and pinning dynamics is more
certainly complex. The morphology of PEDOT:PSS, which is related to
the capillary forces and surface tension of and between the latex
particle, not only varies with batch, but also evolves during drying,
influencing the cracking process. Nevertheless, a more thorough evaluation
of the effects shown here, probing the drying conditions on the contact-line
motion, could provide new routes for self-assembly toward the generation
of patterned films, such as multilayer bands separated by monolayers,
of PEDOT:PSS or other dropcast-able materials, as shown in Figure 1d. Theoretical modeling
of the Marangoni dynamics would be essential in future research efforts
to these ends.

The cracking dynamics studied here are relevant
to our understanding
of the morphology of PEDOT even when cracking does not occur. Here,
we have also shown that the liquid retention in the drying behavior
changes depending on the surface wetting. Moreover, the direction
or alignment of the grains of the PEDOT:PSS and their morphology appear
to be influenced by the shear or tension-related stress. Future research
may compare the influence of surface wetting on the grain morphology
further, with particular attention to the potential for modulated
self-assembly that occurs via competing nonlinear complex drying dynamics.

Experimental
Section
The PEDOT:PSS films are prepared by dropcasting on
clean glass
(Globe Scientific 1405-10, 24 × 24 × 0.21 mm3) and plastic coverslips (Pella 2225, 22 × 22 × 0.18 mm3, poly(vinyl chloride)). The coverslips are rinsed thoroughly
with acetone, methanol, and isopropyl alcohol and blown dry with nitrogen.
The PEDOT:PSS (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5% PEDOT, 0.8% PSS in water) is placed
in a 3 mL cuvette, sealed with parafilm, and sonicated for 10 min
prior to dropcasting.

The substrates are placed on the pan of
a digital balance (Torbal
AGCN200) and the measurement is tared. A fine-tip plastic transfer
pipette is used to deposit approximately 0.25 g of latex on the center
of the substrate. A webcam and Chronolapse software are used to take
time-lapse images of the substrate and for mass readout at regular
intervals throughout the drying process. Droplet profiles are imaged
immediately after deposition with a digital camera. To investigate
drying under vacuum, the droplet is deposited on a substrate placed
in the vacuum chamber of a plasma cleaner (Harrick PDC-326). The use
of this apparatus precluded the collection of mass flux data or time-lapse
images.

The annular cracking behavior is found to be sensitive
to aging
of the PEDOT:PSS material, as well as to ambient temperature and humidity.
Circular cracking is not observed at humidities above 85% and is not
consistently observed when ambient temperatures exceeded 27 °C.
Several weeks after the PEDOT:PSS bottle is opened, aging of the PEDOT:PSS
prevents the circular cracking.

Scanning Electron Microscope
