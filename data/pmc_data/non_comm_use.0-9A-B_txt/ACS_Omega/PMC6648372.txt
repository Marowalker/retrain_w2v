A ceria (CeO2) promoted Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst supported
on SiO2 (Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2) was prepared
and evaluated for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of vanillin.
Silica supported monometallic Cu and Ni catalysts and bimetallic Cu-Ni
catalyst (Cu/SiO2, Ni/SiO2, and Cu-Ni/SiO2), without a ceria promoter, were also synthesized and tested
for the same application. The highest conversion of vanillin was achieved
with the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. Vanillyl
alcohol was the sole product in the initial 2 h, followed by the formation
of 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol, which was observed. Characterization
of the synthesized catalysts revealed the presence of overlapping
crystalline phases of CuO, NiO, and CeO2 on the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 surface. We extended our study to find out
the results of using CeO2 as the support of the Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalyst (Cu-Ni/CeO2). Partial incorporation of Cu and
Ni cations into the ceria lattice took place, leading to the decrease
of specific surface area and a concomitant compromise in the conversion.
In the case of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst,
the higher conversion was accredited to the facile formation of Cu+ active centers by the synergistic interaction between Ce+4/Ce+3 and Cu+2/Cu+ redox
couples and the incorporation of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst
surface.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Lignocellulose
biomass derived bio-oil is recognized as a green
sustainable energy resource against the limited fossil fuel stock.
The lignin fraction of the lignocellulose biomass has a heterogeneous
composition and can be potentially utilized for the production of
biofuel and other fine chemicals.1,2 However, the
lignin-derived pyrolysis oil is high in oxygen content, which significantly
compromises the quality of bio-oil by imparting some undesirable properties,
like difficulty in mixing with conventional fuels, less volatility,
high viscosity, corrosive properties, and unstable nature during long-time
storage.3−5 Deoxygenation of lignin-derived pyrolysis oil is
a challenging task due to its complex structure compared to cellulose-derived
pyrolysis oil. Several approaches have been introduced for the reduction
of the oxygen content of the bio-oil.6,7 Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
(HDO) is considered to be one of the most important and feasible strategies
due to its high conversion efficiency and less energy penalty.8 A considerable research focus could be found
in the literature on the catalytic HDO using different lignocellulosic
model compounds.9−11

Vanillin is an important chemical obtained
by depolymerization
of lignin, presently being carried out on an industrial scale.12 The major products formed during HDO of vanillin
are vanillyl alcohol and 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol. Under H2 gas pressure, the formyl group of vanillin reduces to the corresponding
alcohol producing vanillyl alcohol. Subsequent hydrogenolysis of the
C–O σ bond of the −CH2OH group in the
vanillyl alcohol produces 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol.4 The occurrence of the whole process on a heterogeneous
catalyst surface requires two types of active sites, one for activation
of the gas phase molecular hydrogen and the other for the C–O
bond activation and rupture. Verma and Kishore13 have studied the mechanistic aspects of the catalytic conversion
of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde over the Pd(111) surface through DFT. Deoxygenation
reaction of 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde via alternative routes involving
cleavage of the −OH group and the formyl group was considered.
Cleavage of the formyl group through the formation of a phenol intermediate
was energetically more feasible than the cleavage of the −OH
group. Literature reports also reveal a large control of the catalyst
surface on the product selectivity.14 For
example, the repulsion between the Cu surface and the aromatic ring
of furfural leads to a vertical η1 (−O) orientation
of furfural over the Cu surface via the formyl O. This results in
preferential hydrogenation of the formyl group, forming furfuryl alcohol
as the major product. On the contrary, Ni catalyzed HDO reaction of
furfural leads to decarbonylation to furan and the ring opening to
C4 products. Banerjee and Mushrif15 showed an energetically more favorable flat η2 (C–O)
orientation of the formyl group and parallel alignment of the furan
ring over the Ni(111) surface in a DFT study of furfural HDO.

The reported catalysts active for the HDO of lignin model compounds
include Mo-based sulfides, base metals, noble metals, supported noble
metals, metal phosphides, carbides, and bifunctional catalysts.16−20 An anion vacancy may serve as the active site for interaction of
the O atom with the catalyst surface.21 In Mo-based sulfide catalysts, a sulfur vacancy acts as the active
site for interaction with the O atom lone pair. The catalytic activity
increases with the surface acidity, though catalyst poisoning is a
problem.14 With the base metal catalysts,
undesirable side reactions are commonly observed.22,23 Noble metal nanoparticles are excellent catalysts for hydrogenolysis,
though the cost is high.24−29 Ni is a cheaper substitute of noble metals for efficient dissociative
chemisorption of gas phase H2, but Ni also promotes the
aromatic ring hydrogenation.4,30 However, Ni-based bimetallic
catalysts show a better performance.31 Heeres
et al.32 investigated the catalytic hydrotreatment
of fast pyrolysis oil of lignocellulose biomass employing a δ-Al2O3 supported Cu-Ni catalyst. Seemala et al.33,34 have also reported recently the application of Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalysts for HDO of furfural. Cu-Ni bimetallic catalysts are also
known for several other catalytic applications, like selective hydrogenation
of aldehydes,35 ethanol steam reforming,36,37 water–gas-shift reaction,38 hydrogen
production via steam reforming of glycerol,39 and hydrochlorination reaction.40 The
Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst exhibits several advantages over the monometallic
catalysts like suppression of unwanted side reactions, coke formation,
sintering, deactivation of the catalyst, and so on.38,39,41

In the present study, we have explored
the promotional effect of
CeO2 in the HDO activity of the SiO2 supported
Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst employing vanillin as a model lignocellulosic
compound. The reaction has been carried out in aqueous medium, the
obvious green solvent, under H2 gas pressure. As is known,
the anion vacancy acts as the active site for adsorbing phenol/ aldehyde;
hence, the prepared catalyst has been pretreated under a H2 gas atmosphere to ensure higher density of O vacancies on the catalyst
surface. Ceria is a well-known catalyst or catalyst promoter in numerous
industrial redox processes, three-way catalysis, and so on. The easy
interconversion between +4 and +3 oxidation states of cerium makes
CeO2 a perfectly suitable candidate for redox catalysts.
These facts provoked our interest to take up the present investigation.
In this study, the CeO2 promoted and SiO2 supported
Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst (Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2)
and CeO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic (Cu-Ni/CeO2) catalyst were prepared by a deposition–coprecipitation method.
SiO2 supported monometallic Cu and Ni catalysts and bimetallic
Cu-Ni catalyst were also prepared (Cu/SiO2, Ni/SiO2, and Cu-Ni/SiO2, respectively) for comparison.
All the prepared catalysts were thoroughly characterized by different
techniques and subjected to hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization Studies
The X-ray
diffraction patterns of the bimetallic catalysts Cu-Ni/SiO2, Cu-Ni/CeO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 are furnished in Figure 1. The NiO, CuO, and CeO2 XRD profiles are also
provided for reference purposes. The diffraction pattern of the Cu-Ni/SiO2 sample clearly showed the peaks related to the fcc NiO (111),
(200), and (220) planes at 2θ values of 37.2, 43.2, and 62.7°,
respectively (JCPDS card no. 47-1049), and the CuO (002), (111), and
(022) planes at 2θ values of 35.5, 38.5, and 49.2°, respectively
(JCPDS card no. 80-1916). No characteristic peaks for SiO2 were found due to its amorphous nature. The broad nature of concerned
peaks indicates good dispersion of NiO and CuO over the amorphous
SiO2 support. The Cu-Ni/CeO2 sample, on the
other hand, showed only the peaks related to the reflection from the
(111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) planes of cubic fluorite CeO2 (JCPDS card no. 81-0792). The peaks pertaining to CuO were
not observed. At around 43°, a low intensity peak can be seen
due to the NiO (200) plane. Few unidentified low intense peaks are
visible in the pattern, which could be indicative of alloy formation.
This signified a higher efficiency of the SiO2 support
in stabilizing the CuO and NiO phases than CeO2 support.
The Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 XRD pattern displayed characteristic
peaks pertaining to the reflection from the CeO2 (111),
(200), (220), (311), and (222) planes, NiO (111), (200), and (220)
planes, and CuO (002), (111), and (022) planes. This indicated existence
of well dispersed cubic CeO2, NiO, and CuO phases on the
amorphous SiO2 support. No evidence of the alloy formation
was apparent.

SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst (Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2), CeO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalyst
(Cu-Ni/CeO2), SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalyst (Cu-Ni/SiO2), pure CeO2, NiO, and CuO.

The Raman spectra of bimetallic
catalysts are presented in Figure 2. The Cu-Ni/SiO2 showed a high intense broad
hump between 385 and 587 cm–1 (approx.) with a maximum
at around 501 cm–1. Another low intense broader
hump appeared in between 955 and 1102
cm–1 with a maximum around 1040 cm–1. The broadness and the asymmetry on both sides of the first peak
indicate merging of peaks. According to the literature, the Raman
spectrum of cubic NiO shows several bands above 400 cm–1.42 The first four bands in the lower
wavelength region have vibrational origin and correspond to one-phonon
(1P) TO and LO modes (at ∼570 cm–1), two-phonon
(2P) 2TO modes (at ∼730 cm–1), TO + LO (at
∼906 cm–1), and 2LO (at ∼1090 cm–1) modes. A strong band at ∼1490 cm–1 appears due to two-magnon (2M) scattering. Monoclinic CuO with a C2h6 space group,
on the other hand, exhibits only three Raman active modes (Ag + 2Bg) at around ∼282, 330, and 616 cm–1.43 By comparing with the literature reports,
the first Raman peak between 385 and 587 cm–1 in
the present study has been assigned to Bg Raman mode of
CuO and one-phonon light scattering of NiO. The hump at the higher
wavelength is ascribed to 2LO vibrational mode of NiO. The Cu-Ni/CeO2 catalyst shows only a sharp peak at 440 cm–1. This peak is ascribed to the F2g vibrational mode of
fcc CeO2. In accordance with the XRD pattern, the Raman
spectrum of Cu-Ni/CeO2 exhibited only a Raman peak related
to CeO2 F2g mode. A low intense broad and asymmetric
hump can be observed around 550 to 600 cm–1, which
can be ascribed to the presence of oxygen vacancies in CeO2. The Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst shows a very
broad hump extending from 356 to 590 cm–1 with two
maxima at around 432 and 512 cm–1. The first maximum
could be ascribed to the fcc lattice of CeO2, and the second
maximum would arise due to the presence of CuO and NiO, as in the
Cu-Ni/SiO2 sample, and the oxygen vacancy defects of CeO2. Another low intense broad hump in the spectrum with a maximum
around 1051 cm–1 was correlated with the NiO 2LO
vibrational mode. Interestingly, the Raman spectra of all the catalysts
corroborated very well with their respective XRD patterns.

(Cu-Ni/SiO2).

The influence of different supports on the surface areas
of the
materials was investigated by N2-sorption studies, and
the corresponding results are shown in Figure 3. According to the IUPAC classification,
all the samples exhibited a type-IV isotherm pattern with obvious
hysteresis loops, showing that the materials were essentially mesoporous
in nature. However, the hysteresis loops of the samples were distinctly
different. It can be seen that the hysteresis loop for Cu-Ni/SiO2 is an H2-type and H1-type for the Cu-Ni/CeO2 and
Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts. According to the
literature, H1-type is characteristic of mesoporous materials having
uniform nearly cylindrical channels, whereas H2-type is frequently
associated with solids consisting of “ink-bottle” shaped
pores.44 Further, the position in terms
of relative pressure and size/volume of the N2 hysteresis
loop of each sample is also different. It can be clearly seen from
the figure that the larger hysteresis loop was observed in the isotherm
for Cu-Ni/SiO2 at P/Po of 0.58 to 0.88 while Cu-Ni/CeO2 and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 have narrow hysteresis loops at almost equal P/Po of 0.71 to 0.95, which
is comparable to the BET surface area. In addition, as shown in Figure 3, the displacement
of the hysteresis loops in Cu-Ni/CeO2 and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 toward the higher P/Po might be an indication of the porosity’s evolution.
The specific surface areas of Cu-Ni/SiO2, Cu-Ni/CeO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts are
estimated by the BET method, and the corresponding values were 209,
79, and 142 m2/g, respectively. The variation in surface
areas of the samples can be due to the different interaction of Ni-Cu
species with the used supports. Among all the prepared catalysts,
the Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalyst exhibited the highest surface area
of 209 m2/g. The high surface area of Cu-Ni/SiO2 could be mainly attributed to the use of colloidal silica and the
high dispersion of more active Ni-Cu species over its surface.45 Nonetheless, all our prepared catalysts exhibit
satisfactory surface areas with mesoporous nature.

Figure 4a,b
and Figure S1 represent the TEM, HRTEM,
and EDX images
of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. The TEM image
showed almost spherical shaped particles. In the HRTEM image, overlapping
phases of NiO, CuO, and CeO2 were observed. The appearance
of the NiO (200), CuO (002), and CeO2 (111) planes with d-spacing values of 2.09, 0.25, and 0.301 nm, respectively,
was visible. The corresponding XRD pattern also showed peaks related
to reflection from those planes. The EDX pattern showed the actual
presence of all the elements including Cu, Ni, Ce, Si, and O. The
surface morphology of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2, Cu-Ni/SiO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2 catalysts was studied by FESEM
and is presented in Figure 5 and Figures S2 and S3. The mesoporous
nature of the samples was revealed from these images. Nearly spherical
morphology was observed in line with the TEM analysis. The particles
of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst had an average
diameter of 25 nm.

The oxidation state of the active
metal site has critical control
over its catalytic performance.46,47 The best performing
Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst was subjected to XPS
analysis in the energy window of (a) Cu 2p, (b) Ni 2p, (c) Ce 3d,
and (d) O 1s, which are represented in Figure 6a–d. As shown in Figure 6a, the Cu 2p3/2 and
Cu 2p1/2 peaks for Cu+ appeared at 933.3 and
953.2 eV, respectively, with the splitting energy of 19.9 eV, characteristic
of Cu+. The Cu2+ peaks of 2p3/2 and
2p1/2 were located at 935.2 and 955.5 eV, respectively.
Hence, the spectrum indicated the presence of both +1 and +2 oxidation
states of Cu.48 The Ni 2p spectrum (Figure 6b) showed the presence
of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks along with satellite
peaks. The Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks were
deconvoluted into two peaks each at binding energies of 854.8 and
856.8 eV and 872.2 and 873.7 eV, respectively. The spectrum showed
characteristic features of Ni+2.49Figure 6c represents
the Ce 3d XPS spectrum. The complex spectrum was assigned to two sets
of spin-orbital multiplets, corresponding to the 3d3/2 and
3d5/2, labeled u and v, respectively. The u and v peaks
were deconvoluted into 10 peaks. The peaks denoted as v, v″,
v‴, u, u″, and u‴ were attributed to the Ce+4 and v′, v0, u′, and u0 to the Ce3+ contribution.50 The O 1s core level spectra illustrated in Figure 6d were broad and asymmetric in nature and
deconvoluted into two peaks. The peak observed around 530.2 eV was
attributed to lattice oxygen (Oα), while the non-lattice
oxygen was assigned to the peaks observed at around 531.9 eV, which
included surface adsorbed oxygen (Oβ).51

2.2 Catalytic
Activity
The HDO of vanillin
in aqueous solution was investigated as a model catalytic reaction
for biofuel upgradation. Two main products, that is, 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol
(MC) and vanillyl alcohol (VA), were obtained during the HDO of vanillin
under mild conditions, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Hydrodeoxygenation of Vanillin
We have investigated the catalytic
performance of monometallic
Ni/SiO2 and Cu/SiO2 and bimetallic Cu-Ni/SiO2, Cu-Ni/CeO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin under the optimized
reaction conditions of 25 bar H2 pressure and 160 °C
temperature. The percentage conversions of vanillin after 12 h of
reaction are presented in Figure 7. The monometallic catalysts, Ni/SiO2 and
Cu/SiO2, exhibited much lower conversion compared to the
bimetallic catalysts. On the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, facile dissociation
of H2 takes place, but preferential coordination with the
aromatic ring also happens resulting in poor conversion. On the other
hand, Cu is known to selectively interact with the aldehyde group,
but exhibits a very low rate of H2 dissociation, resulting
in lower conversion over the Cu/SiO2 catalyst. On the supported
Cu-Ni bimetallic catalysts, dissociation of molecular H2 readily takes place at the catalytically active Ni sites and spillover
of atomic H occurs on the Cu sites.33,34 Consequently,
facile hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin takes place exploiting the inherent
catalytic properties of Cu. The influence of varying Cu/Ni (2:1, 1:2,
1:1) ratios in the presence of the CeO2 promoter (20 wt
%) was also investigated. The best conversion was achieved with the
Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst with a 1:1 ratio of
Cu and Ni. This indicated a better synergism between Cu and Ni when
present in equal proportions.

Figure 7 Conversion (%) of vanillin in hydrodeoxygenation
reaction over
SiO2 supported Ni (Ni/SiO2), SiO2 supported Cu (Cu/SiO2), CeO2 promoted SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst (Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2), CeO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst
(Cu-Ni/CeO2), and SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalyst (Cu-Ni/SiO2).

The conversion of vanillin and selectivity of the products
on the
best performing Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst were
checked with time and are presented in Figure 8. Samples were withdrawn every 2 h and analyzed.
In the initial 2 h of the reaction, VA was the sole product. After
that, the selectivity of MC started increasing gradually with a steady
decrease in VA selectivity. In the initial stages of the reaction,
vanillin was converted to VA at a moderate rate, and more than 75%
conversion was achieved within 8 h. When the reaction time was prolonged
up to 12 h, the conversion percentage enhanced to almost 96%. The
reusability of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst
was verified for 10 consecutive cycles and is presented in Figure S4. During the initial six cycles, a nominal
loss of conversion was noticed, which could be due to the loss of
catalyst during the recovery process after each cycle. After the sixth
cycle, a considerable decrease of the activity was noticed. In order
to check the stability of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst on longer duration, the reaction was continued for 25 h
at 160 °C and 25 bar H2 gas pressure. Subsequent gas
chromatographic (GC) analysis confirmed the formation of a number
of over-hydrogenated products with decreased concentrations of VA
and MC, as shown in Figure S5. The leaching
test was also performed with hot filtration (experimental details
provided in page S9 of the Supporting Information, Figure S6), which confirmed the heterogeneous nature of the
Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst. No detectable leaching
of the catalyst was found in the AAS analysis.

and product selectivity against reaction

The influence of varying
reaction temperature and pressure was
also checked over the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst
and is shown in Figure 9a,b, respectively. The influence of reaction temperature was investigated
within the 100–160 °C temperature range under 25 bar pressure
for 12 h. At 100 °C, the conversion was less than 50%. With rising
temperature, the conversion started increasing gradually and reached
a steady state around 150 °C. At a lower temperature range, the
selectivity of VA was much higher than that of MC. Around 115 °C
temperature, the selectivities of VA and MC were equal. With a further
increase in temperature, the VA selectivity showed a sharp decrease
with a gradual rise in the MC selectivity. Beyond 120 °C, over-hydrogenated
products started forming. The influence of pressure was studied by
varying the H2 pressure from 10 to 40 bar at 150 °C
for 12 h. Figure 9b
apparently shows that, with increasing pressure, the conversion gradually
increases and reaches a steady state at around 25 bar. The selectivity
of MC also gradually increased with pressure and reached a maximum
at 25 bar H2 pressure. On further increase of pressure,
the selectivity of MC sharply decreased with a concomitant increase
in the selectivity of other products.

2.3 Promotional
Role of CeO2
The vanillin conversion and the product
selectivity were studied
after 12 h of reaction over the bimetallic catalysts, namely, Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2, Cu-Ni/SiO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2, under the optimized conditions (Figure 10). The vanillin conversion was higher over
the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst than that of Cu-Ni/SiO2, despite lower surface area. This was a clear indication
of the promotional role of CeO2 in the catalytic HDO of
vanillin over the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst.
In the literature, the CeO2 supported CuO catalyst (CuO/CeO2) has been deeply investigated for several catalytic applications.
The CO oxidation bears special importance among them.52−54 Liu and Flytzanistephanopoulos55 proposed
the formation of Cu+ species in CuO/CeO2 due
to the interaction of Cu clusters with CeO2. Jia et al.56 also demonstrated facile
reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ in the CuO/CeO2 due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox process.
The Cu2+ in contact with the CeO2 gains electrons
from Ce3+ → Ce4+ oxidation giving rise
to Cu+. Another recent study57 related to the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation application
of the Cu-Ni/CeO2 nanotube has also confirmed that the
Cu metal strongly interacts with CeO2, resulting in the
electron transfer between Ce4+ and Cu facilitating the
formation of Cu+. The Cu+ enhances the adsorption
of CO by forming Cu+-carbonyl species.58,59 Interestingly, Tan et al.57 have also
demonstrated that the higher oxygen vacancies are formed due to the
strong interaction between Cu-Ni alloy and CeO2 and participate
in the activation of CO2. The formation of CuO/CeO2 interfacial sites plays a vital role in the creation of such
synergistic redox properties.60 In the
present study, the promotional effect of CeO2 can be attributed
to similar synergism between the Ce4+/Ce3+ and
Cu2+/Cu+ redox couples. Existence of Cu+ was evident from the XPS study. The Ce4+/Ce3+ redox process facilitated the reversible formation of Cu2+ ↔ Cu+, which assisted the adsorption of
the reactant molecule through the formyl group and desorption of the
product molecule from the catalyst surface. Based on this, a reaction
scheme has been proposed as shown in Figure 11. Moreover, the catalysts were pretreated
in H2 flow, which ensured the abundance of O vacancies
on the catalyst surface. The O vacant sites might also play an important
role in the activation of the carbonyl/hydroxyl groups of vanillin/VA.21 Interestingly, in the Cu-Ni/CeO2 catalyzed
reaction, over-hydrogenation of the product MC was arrested. The use
of CeO2 as support provides ample oxygen vacancies, which
might stop the over-hydrogenation of the product MC. However, the
conversion percentage was much lower than that of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst, which can be reasonably justified
from the low surface area of the catalyst.

3 Conclusions
The present study was focused
on the promotional effect of CeO2 on the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin over the
Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst supported on SiO2. Bimetallic
catalysts Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2, Cu-Ni/SiO2, and Cu-Ni/CeO2 were prepared, characterized, and tested
for their catalytic activity. SiO2 supported monometallic
Cu and Ni catalysts were also prepared and evaluated for their catalytic
activity. All the bimetallic catalysts exhibited better activity than
the monometallic catalysts. The SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic
catalyst showed significantly improved catalytic activity on the use
of the CeO2 promoter. The XRD results and Raman spectra
of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst revealed the
presence of crystalline phases of NiO, CuO, and CeO2 over
the amorphous SiO2 support. Meanwhile, in the CeO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst, the Cu and Ni ions were partially
incorporated into the CeO2 lattice. Traces of alloy formation
were also observed. TEM/HRTEM, EDX, FESEM, and XPS studies were carried
out on the best performing Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 catalyst.
Surface morphology showed the presence of nearly spherical shaped
nanoparticles. The HRTEM image displayed the overlapping phases of
CuO, NiO, and CeO2. XPS analysis revealed the presence
of +1 and +2 oxidation states of Cu, +3 and +4 oxidation states of
Ce, and +2 oxidation state of Ni over the catalyst surface. The Ni+2 served as the active site for dissociative adsorption of
H2, and the Cu+ ions served as active centers
for hydrogenation of the formyl group. The Ce+4 →
Ce+3 processes facilitated the formation of Cu+ species. The reaction pathway followed the initial reduction of
the formyl group yielding VA, as can be understood from the sole formation
of VA in the first 2 h of the reaction, followed by deoxygenation
of the −CH2OH group of VA forming MC. The better
catalytic activity of the Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 was
accredited to the synergism between the Cu+/Cu+2 and Ce+3/Ce+4 redox couples and the incorporation
of oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface by CeO2. A
plausible reaction mechanism has been proposed based on the synergism
between the Cu+/Cu2+ and Ce3+/Ce4+ redox cycles. The observations made in the present study
indicate a promotional role of CeO2 in the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin on the SiO2 supported Cu-Ni bimetallic catalyst.
Nevertheless, further investigations should be followed for a deeper
understanding of the promoting effect of CeO2.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
Monometallic
catalysts Cu/SiO2 (10 wt % Cu) and Ni/SiO2 (10
wt % Ni) and bimetallic catalysts Cu-Ni/SiO2 (10 wt % each),
Cu-Ni/CeO2 (10 wt % each), and Cu-Ni/CeO2-SiO2 (10 wt % each and 20 wt % CeO2, optimized) were
prepared by the conventional deposition–coprecipitation method
(details provided in the Supporting Information, page S2), calcined at 500 °C, and subsequently treated
in the H2 gas flow in the temperature range of 500–550
°C.

4.2 Characterization
The prepared materials
were characterized employing X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy,
N2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM)/high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray
(EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS) techniques. The details of the catalyst characterizations
are provided in page S3 of the Supporting Information.

4.3 Catalytic Activity
The catalytic
HDO of vanillin was performed in a sealed autoclave. In a Teflon lined
50 mL stainless steel autoclave, 20 mg of the catalysts was dispersed
in 10 mL of DI water. Subsequently, 228 mg of vanillin was added to
it. Then the autoclave was sealed, and the reactor was thoroughly
purged with N2, followed by H2. Next, the reactor
was pressurized with H2 to 25 bar and heated to 150 °C
under magnetic stirring at 1000 rpm. Cold water was used to cool down
the autoclave quickly after the reaction. The organic compounds present
in the reaction mixture were extracted in ethyl acetate. The aqueous
phase was centrifuged to recover the catalyst, which was washed with
water and ethanol several times. The reaction solutions were analyzed
by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu 2010) equipped with a flame ionization
detector using a capillary column (diameter: 0.25 mm, length: 30 m)
in the presence of 1,4-dichlorobenzene as the internal standard. The
products were also identified by GC–MS (Shimadzu, GCMS-QP2010S)
analysis.
