The negative thermal expansion (NTE)
material Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 has been investigated for the
first time within the framework of the density functional perturbation
theory (DFPT). The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties
of this material have been predicted using the Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof
for solid (PBEsol) exchange–correlation functional, which showed
superior accuracy over standard functionals in previous computational
studies of the NTE material α-ZrW2O8.
The bulk modulus calculated for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 using the Vinet equation of state at room temperature
is K0 = 63.6 GPa, which is in close agreement
with the experimental estimate of 61.3(8) at T =
296 K. The computed mean linear coefficient of thermal expansion is
−3.1 × 10–6 K−1 in
the temperature range ∼0–70 K, in line with the X-ray
diffraction measurements. The mean Grüneisen parameter controlling
the thermal expansion of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is negative below 205 K, with a minimum of −2.1
at 10 K. The calculated standard molar heat capacity and entropy are CP0 = 287.6 and S0 = 321.9 J·mol–1·K–1, respectively. The results reported in this study demonstrate the
accuracy of DFPT/PBEsol for assessing or predicting the relationship
between structural and thermomechanical properties of NTE materials.

1 Introduction
Negative
thermal expansion (NTE) materials have received considerable
experimental and theoretical attention over the past few decades.1−9 In contrast to most materials, which expand on heating due to anharmonic
lattice dynamics,10 NTE materials contract
as the temperature rises, owing to mechanisms ranging from structural/magnetic
phase transitions to anomalous vibrational modes (e.g., transverse
vibrational modes or rigid unit modes).3,5,7,8 Well-known examples
of NTE materials include silicon, germanium, uranium, β-quartz,
elastomers, as well as some framework-structured ceramics and zeolites.1,3−6,8 NTE materials are often used as
thermal-expansion compensators in composites designed to have overall
zero or tunable thermal expansion.7 Precise
control of the thermal expansion of materials is critical, for example,
in high-precision optical systems, nanoscale semiconductor devices,
fuel cells, or high-performance thermoelectric converters.4,7,8

Several phases in the Zr/W/O,
Zr/V/P/O, and Zr/W/P/O systems have
been identified as low or negative thermal expansion materials.11−28 Among crystalline phases of the Zr/W/P/O system, Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 was the first reported structure
featuring coexistence of WO4 and PO4 coordination.
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 was originally
synthesized by Martinek and Hummel29 as
the ternary compound 2ZrO2·WO3·P2O5 and characterized by Tsvigunov and Sirotinkin.30 Using room-temperature powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) data, Evans et al.31 fully solved
the structure of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, which crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Pbcn (IT no. 60, setting no. 3 Pnca (c, a, b); a = 9.35451(9), b = 12.31831(9), and c = 9.16711(8) Å; Z = 4), with corner-sharing
ZrO6 octahedral and WO4 and PO4 tetrahedral
coordination units. This structure is related to the phases A2(MO4)3 (with M = Mo, A = Al, Sc, Cr,
Fe, Y, In, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu, or with M = W, A = Al, Sc, Fe,
In, Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Yb, Tm, Yb, and Lu) which adopt the orthorhombic Pbcn/Pnca or monoclinic P21/a arrangements.

As shown in
dilatometer and XRD studies, orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 exhibits unusual NTE
over a broad temperature range from below room-temperature up to ∼1373
K, without phase transition at atmospheric pressure.32−37 As discussed by Evans et al.,32 NTE in
both A2(MO4)3- and ZrW2O8-type structures stems from the transverse thermal motion
of bridging O atoms in A–O–M or Zr–O–W
linkages. Owing to its remarkable thermal stability, Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is often combined with
other NTE materials in the fabrication of a variety of NTE composites
(e.g., Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2/ZrW2O8 or Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2/ZrV0.6P1.4O7).38−40

However, synthesis of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 with consistent and well-controlled NTE properties
has revealed to be challenging. Evans et al.32 reported mean linear coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of
−6 × 10–6 and −3 × 10–6 K−1 using dilatometer and XRD measurements,
respectively, in the temperature range ∼50–450 K. Cetinkol
and Wilkinson34 obtained a value of −5
× 10–6 K−1 from neutron diffraction
data between 60 and 300 K and Isobe et al. measured a value of −3.4
× 10–6 K−1 in the range ∼300–875
K. Recently, values of −2.36 × 10–6 and
−2.61 × 10–6 K−1 were
estimated by Liu et al. in the temperature range ∼300–1000
K for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 samples
sintered at 1573 and 1673 K, respectively. Such differences in CTE
can be ascribed to the different porosities or average grain sizes
resulting from sintering conditions and synthesis reactions32−37 as well as to possible pressure-induced phase transformations41 during sample fabrication. Apart from these
CTE experimental estimates, very limited information is available
on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, and no computational studies
of this NTE material have been conducted, to the best of our knowledge.

In this work, the orthorhombic phase of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 has been investigated for the first
time within the framework of the density functional perturbation theory
(DFPT). Specifically, the structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic
properties of this material have been predicted using the exchange–correlation
(XC) functional parameterized by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof for
solids (PBEsol),42 which showed superior
accuracy over standard functionals in recent density functional studies
of the NTE material α-ZrW2O8.43,44 As demonstrated in previous studies, lattice dynamics simulations
using density functional theory (DFT) approaches can provide invaluable
information on the structure–properties relationship of NTE
materials.43−46 As limited experimental data exist on the mechanical and thermodynamic
properties of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, results predicted in this study have also been systematically compared
to measured and calculated properties of α-ZrW2O8.

Analysis and discussion of our results are given in Section 2, followed by a
summary of
our findings and conclusions in Section 3. Details of our computational approach are
provided in Section 4.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal
Structure
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern simulated
from the relaxed crystal structure optimized with DFT in this study,
along with the room-temperature powder XRD pattern of the orthorhombic
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 structure
(space group Pbcn) characterized by Evans et al.31 (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å).
Excellent overall agreement is achieved between the simulated and
measured XRD patterns, without noticeable peak shift of 2θ values.

structure optimized with DFT at the GGA/PBEsol level of theory. Major
observed reflections are indexed in the hkl representation.

The orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 structure optimized
with generalized gradient approximation
(GGA)/PBEsol at T = 0 K possesses crystal unit-cell
parameters of a = 9.432, b = 12.432,
and c = 9.250 Å (b/a = 1.318, c/a = 0.981; V = 1084.59 Å3). Owing to NTE and to the
fact that GGA functionals typically overestimate bond distances, the
unit-cell volume predicted in the athermal limit is ∼2.3% larger
than the estimate of V = 1059.34(4) Å3 (a = 9.3640(3), b = 12.3243(4),
and c = 9.1793(3) Å; b/a = 1.3161, c/a = 0.9803)
obtained at T = 60 K by Cetinkol and Wilkinson34 using neutron diffraction data. As reported
in Table 1, these predicted
lattice constants remain close to neutron data34 at T = 296 K [a = 9.3462(3), b = 12.3313(4), and c = 9.1606(3) Å; b/a = 1.3194, c/a = 0.9801; V = 1055.77(4) Å3], and the powder XRD data measured by Evans et al.31 at T = 300 K [a = 9.35451(9), b = 12.31831(9), and c = 9.16711(8) Å; b/a = 1.3168, c/a = 0.9800; V = 1056.34 Å3].

As described by Evans and coworkers,31 the orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 phase is made up of corner-sharing
ZrO6 octahedral
and WO4 and PO4 tetrahedral coordination units.
Each ZrO6 octahedron is connected to four PO4 and two WO4 units. Unlike α-ZrW2O8 which features two distinct WO4 tetrahedral coordination
units, all WO4 units in Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 are crystallographically equivalent. W atoms
occupy 4c Wyckoff sites (0.2 symmetry), whereas Zr,
P, and O atoms are all positioned on 8d Wyckoff sites
(1 symmetry). The average O–Zr, O–W, and O–P
bond distances are predicted to be 2.085, 1.783, and 1.537 Å,
respectively, which are in good agreement with the XRD estimates of
2.087, 1.767, and 1.500 Å (see Table 2). These values are also in line with the
average O–Zr, O–W1, and O–W2 bond distances of
2.084, 1.799, and 1.787 Å, respectively, calculated for α-ZrW2O8 using PBEsol.44 The
large difference between coordination distances at the W and P sites
directly reflects the difference in cation ionic radii. Both calculated
and measured tetrahedral O–W–O and O–P–O
and octahedral O–Zr–O angles are close to the ideal
values of 109.5 and 90.0°, respectively. The optimized (measured)
ZrO6 octahedral units have a volume of 11.979 (11.995)
Å3, a bond length distortion index of 0.022 (0.026),
a quadratic elongation of 1.006 (1.008), a bond angle variance of
20.4°2 (24.4°2), and an effective
coordination of 5.87 (5.83). The calculated (measured) WO4 and PO4 tetrahedral units are characterized by volumes
of 2.909 (2.820) and 1.863 (1.731) Å3, bond length
distortion indices of 0.000 (0.022) and 0.002 (0.018), quadratic elongations
of 1.000 (1.003) and 1.000 (1.001), bond angle variances of 0.5°2 (8.6°2) and 0.4°2 (3.6°2), and effective coordinations of 4.00 (3.93) and 4.00 (3.93),
respectively. These values indicate that polyhedral distortion in
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 occurs
mostly through angular distortion of the ZrO6 octahedral
units, which exhibit the largest bond angle variance, whereas the
smaller WO4 and PO4 tetrahedral units remain
nearly ideal (bond length distortion indices close to zero and bond
angle variances of ≤0.5°2). In addition, the
systematically larger values of bond angle variances and bond length
distortion indices in the observed structure, compared to the present
PBEsol results, suggest that some minor residual (micro)stresses or
imperfections might persist in the crystal structure characterized
in the room temperature powder XRD experiments.

By comparison,
in α-ZrW2O8, the optimized
(measured) ZrO6 octahedra have a volume of 12.115 (11.952)
Å3, a bond length distortion index of 0.014 (0.018),
a quadratic elongation of 1.001 (1.001), a bond angle variance of
3.7°2 (3.3°2), and an effective coordination
of 5.96 (5.92). The computed (measured) W1O4 and W2O4 tetrahedra are characterized by volumes of 2.872 (2.815)
and 2.925 (2.759) Å3, bond length distortion indices
of 0.019 (0.016) and 0.010 (0.017), quadratic elongations of 1.028
(1.021) and 1.000 (1.001), bond angle variances of 77.6°2 (61.0°2) and 0.0°2 (0.0°2), and effective coordinations of 3.91 (3.94) and 3.98 (3.94),
respectively.

2.2 Thermodynamic Properties
Phonon calculations
were conducted within the quasi-harmonic approximation (QHA) to predict
the isobaric thermal properties of the orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2. As a part of the anharmonic
effect,47 a volume dependence of phonon
frequencies was introduced within the QHA. A temperature effect was
added to the total energy U(V) of
the system through the phonon contribution, Fphonon, calculated at constant volume as a function of the
temperature T, that is, 1  where v and q are the band index and wave vector, respectively,
ℏ is the
reduced Planck constant, ℏωq,v is the energy of a single phonon with angular frequency
ωq,v, T is the temperature of the system, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and β = (kBT)−1.

The thermal
variation of the U(V) + Fphonon(T;V) energy as a function of the orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 unit-cell volume calculated
with DFPT in the temperature range T = 0–950
K is displayed in Figure 3. The variation of the locus of points corresponding to the
local free energy curve (represented by red circles at 10 K intervals
in Figure 3) shows
a slight initial contraction in unit-cell volume as the temperature
increases, followed by typical thermal expansion at higher temperature.

Figure 3 Variation
of the total energy with phonon contribution, U(V) + Fphonon(T;V), of orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 as a function of the
unit-cell volume calculated with DFPT at the GGA/PBEsol level from T = 0–950 K, at 50 K intervals. Local free energy
minima are indicated by red circles, at 10 K intervals.

A volume dependence of the thermodynamic functions
needs to be
introduced through a transformation to determine the thermal properties
of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 at constant
pressure. This is achieved by defining the Gibbs free energy at constant
pressure as follows 2  where minV [function
of V] corresponds to a unique minimum of the expression
between brackets with respect to the volume V, and U and P are the total energy and pressure
of the system. Fphonon(T;V) and U(V) were
computed with DFPT/DFT, and the thermodynamic functions of the right-hand
side of eq 2 were fitted
to the integral form of the universal Vinet48 equation of state (EoS). The Vinet EoS is defined as 3  where P corresponds to the
uniform hydrostatic pressure, V0 and V are the reference and deformed cell volumes, respectively,
and where K0 and K0′ are the
bulk modulus and its first derivative with respect to the pressure,
expressed as 4  with 5  

The bulk modulus values for
single-crystal Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated using the Vinet EoS
[eqs 3–5] at T = 0 and 300 K are K0 = 62.9 and 63.6 GPa, respectively, close to
the experimental estimate of 61.3(8) at T = 296 K,
reported by Cetinkol and Wilkinson34 using
a 3rd order Birch–Murnaghan (BM) EoS to fit measured unit-cell
volumes. However, these predicted values appear significantly larger
than the other experimental value of 49(2) GPa estimated by Cetinkol
et al.41 using a BM EoS (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Thermal evolution of the bulk modulus, K0, for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated
using the Vinet EoS with DFPT/PBEsol. The experimental estimate from
Cetinkol and Wilkinson (ref (34)) at T = 296 K is also depicted.

For the sake of comparison, the
bulk modulus for polycrystalline
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 was estimated
to be 75.0 GPa within the Voigt–Reuss–Hill (VRH) approximations.
As described in Supporting Information,
this value was obtained from the elastic constants calculated at T = 0 K with DFPT as the second derivative of the energy
with respect to the strain. The nine independent elastic constants
in the stiffness matrix calculated with DFPT/PBEsol for the orthorhombic
Zr2(WO4)(PO4) structure are: C11 = 150.0 GPa, C22 = 100.9 GPa, C33 = 139.4 GPa, C44 = 31.4 GPa, C55 = 51.6 GPa, C66 = 29.8 GPa, C12 = 39.4 GPa, C13 = 76.6 GPa, and C23 = 39.0 GPa. The
orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4) structure
appears to be mechanically stable because the Born stability conditions49,50 are satisfied (cf. Supporting Information). As shown in Table 3, these values are relatively close to the elastic constants predicted
for cubic α-ZrW2O8 at T = 0 K with DFPT/PBEsol. Let us note that, although the VRH polycrystalline
bulk modulus is slightly larger than its corresponding single-crystal
value for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, it remains appreciably smaller than the VRH value of 105.7 GPa
obtained at the same level of theory for polycrystalline α-ZrW2O8.

In addition, the VRH shear (G) and
Young’s
(E) moduli, Poisson’s ratio (ν), Vickers
microhardness (Hv), and Debye temperature
(θD) for polycrystalline Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 were computed from elastic constants
(see Table 3 and Supporting Information). The predicted shear
modulus of G = 37.2 GPa is close to the value of
34.4 GPa obtained for α-ZrW2O8 with DFPT/PBEsol.43 The calculated Young’s modulus—representing
the ratio of stress to strain—of E = 95.7
GPa is also close to the computed43 and
measured24 values of 93.2 and 98.8 GPa
for α-ZrW2O8, although it is ∼29%
larger than the experimental estimate of 74 GPa determined by Isobe
et al.33 Such a large discrepancy might
stem in part from the density (95% of the theoretical density) and
the presence of MgO additive contained in the Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 samples characterized experimentally
by Isobe et al.33 Nevertheless, the calculated
Poisson’s ratio of ν = 0.287 and Vickers microhardness
(i.e., the material’s ability to resist plastic deformation)
of Hv = 4.3 GPa are in good agreement
with the experimental values of 0.25 and 4.4 GPa, respectively, reported
by Isobe et al.33 Poisson’s ratio
provides a measure of the malleability of crystalline compounds;51 the Poisson’s ratio is close to 1/3 for
ductile materials, whereas for brittle materials, it is generally
much less than 1/3. Therefore, Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 can be considered ductile, although slightly
less ductile than α-ZrW2O8, which features
larger computed and measured Poisson’s ratios of 0.353 and
0.342, respectively. The Debye temperature for polycrystalline Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is predicted
to be θD = 413 K, suggesting a higher microhardness52 than α-ZrW2O8, which
exhibits lower calculated43 and measured24 Debye temperatures of 337 and 333 K, respectively.

Figure 5 shows the
variation with temperature of the linear CTE of orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 computed with
DFPT/PBEsol within the QHA, along with the mean linear CTE values
for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 from
the dilatometer and XRD measurements in the range 50–450 K32 and from neutron diffraction data in the range
60–300 K.34 Previous DFPT linear
CTE results43 for single crystal α-ZrW2O8 and linear CTE estimates from high-resolution
neutron diffraction data18 for polycrystalline
ZrW2O8 are also represented for comparison.
As discussed in our previous DFPT/PBEsol study of NTE α-ZrW2O8, the linear CTE results obtained with DFPT/PBEsol
within the QHA depart significantly from the experimental data above
∼70 K, therefore the calculated linear CTE results for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 are shown for
only up to room temperature (see ref (43) for details). The linear CTE was calculated
using the expression αL = V0–1/3Δ(V1/3)/ΔT, where the reference crystal cell volume, V0, corresponds to the temperature T = 0 K and Δ(V1/3)/ΔT is the variation of the cell volume with temperature.
As discussed above (see Figure 3), the volume dependence of the phonon free energy varies
with temperature, resulting in a temperature-dependent equilibrium
volume of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, which can be assimilated into thermal expansion within the QHA
approach. As depicted in Figure 5, the computed linear CTE for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 reaches an extremum of −5.6
× 10–6 K−1 at ∼70
K, and NTE persists below 207 K. Similar behavior was predicted with
DFPT/PBEsol for single-crystal α-ZrW2O8, reaching an extremum of −7.7 × 10–6 K−1 near ∼70 K and exhibiting NTE below
242 K.43 In previous studies of α-ZrW2O8, discrepancies were found above ∼60–70
K between experimental NTE data for polycrystalline samples18 and DFT/B3LYP or DFPT/PBEsol calculations of
ideal single-crystal α-ZrW2O8 models43,46 (see Figure 5). Such
differences were attributed in part to the creation of thermally induced
defects in real samples and might also be ascribed to inherent limitations
of the QHA approach, which fails to accurately account for explicit/true
anharmonicity. The mean linear CTE calculated here for orthorhombic
single-crystal Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is −3.1 × 10–6 K−1 in the temperature range ∼0–70 K. This value is in
good agreement with the mean linear CTE of −3 × 10–6 K−1 measured by Evans et al.32 using XRD measurements in the temperature range
∼50–450 K, although only half of the value of −6
× 10–6 K−1 reported by these
authors using dilatometer data was over the same temperature range
and smaller than the estimate of −5 × 10–6 K−1 as reported by Cetinkol and Wilkinson34 from neutron diffraction data between 60 and
300 K. Other recent experimental mean linear CTE estimates above room
temperature are consistent with the value calculated in this study
at low temperature. For example, Isobe and coworkers33 measured a value of −3.4 × 10–6 K−1 in the range ∼300–875 K, and
Liu et al.36 reported values of −2.36
× 10–6 and −2.61 × 10–6 K−1 in the temperature range ∼300–1000
K for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 samples
sintered at 1573 and 1673 K, respectively. It is important to note
that, as mentioned in the Introduction section,
differences in the CTE for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 can be attributed to different porosities or average
grain sizes resulting from sintering conditions and/or synthesis reactions
and to possible pressure-induced phase transformations during sample
fabrication.

Figure 5 Linear CTE of orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 computed with DFPT at the GGA/PBEsol
level within
the QHA. Mean linear CTE values for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 from the dilatometer and XRD measurements in
the range 50–450 K (ref (32)) and from neutron diffraction data in the range 60–300
K (ref (34)) are displayed
as horizontal lines. DFPT results for single crystal α-ZrW2O8 (ref (43)) and linear CTE estimates (circles) from high-resolution
neutron diffraction data for polycrystalline ZrW2O8 (ref (18))
are also represented for comparison.

The vibrational theory of thermal expansion formulated by
Grüneisen53,54 was utilized to calculate the
thermal evolution of the mean Grüneisen
parameter γ of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2, as well as the mode Grüneisen parameters as
functions of frequency, represented in Figure 6. Within this theoretical framework, the
thermal expansion of materials is given by αL = ∑iαi = γCV/3K, where CV is the specific heat capacity, K is the bulk modulus, and γ is the mean Grüneisen
parameter expressed as γ = ∑iγici/∑ici, where the mode Grüneisen parameters
given by γi = −∂ln
ωi/∂ln V represent the relative change of mode frequencies, ωi with crystal cell volume V and ci are the contributions of
these vibrational modes to the total specific heat CV.

Figure 6 Thermal evolution of the mean Grüneisen
parameter, γ,
of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated
using DFPT at the GGA/PBEsol level within the QHA. Corresponding GGA/PBEsol
results for α-ZrW2O8 (ref (43)) are also displayed. Calculated
Debye temperatures, θD, are represented by vertical
dashed lines. Inset: Calculated mode Grüneisen parameters of
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 as functions
of frequency.

In the expression of
the thermal expansion αL =
γCV/3K, both the bulk modulus and the specific heat are positive, therefore,
the mean Grüneisen parameter, γ, is the parameter controlling
the positive or negative thermal expansion, with the NTE originating
from vibrational modes with γi <
0. As shown in Figure 6, the mean Grüneisen parameter of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated with DFPT/PBEsol is negative
below 205 K, with a minimum of −2.1 at 10 K. At the same level
of theory, γ was predicted to be negative below 245 K for α-ZrW2O8, with a minimum of −6.56 at 10 K. Despite
being positive above 205 K, γ for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 remains close to zero up to its Debye
temperature of 413 K, which is the temperature above which most vibrational
modes of the crystal are fully excited. Therefore, phonon modes have
little to no net effect on the lattice expansion between ∼205
and 413 K. Similarly, David et al.18 observed
that phonon modes play a very limited role in the lattice expansion
of α-ZrW2O8 in the temperature range of
∼300–550 K. A closer examination of the computed mode
Grüneisen parameters of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 (see inset in Figure 6) reveals that the two lowest-frequency optical
phonons at 24 cm–1 (γ1 = −17.7)
and 38 cm–1 (γ2 = −6.8)
contribute mainly to NTE, along with numerous phonon modes with γi < 0 below ∼300 K. Although a full
analysis of the phonon modes is beyond the scope of the present study
and will be the focus of a forthcoming investigation, preliminary
analysis suggests that both the lowest-temperature modes are characterized
by variations of intrapolyhedral bond angles O–M–O (M
= W, Zr), with relatively limited M–O bond distance variation.
These results are consistent with the findings for α-ZrW2O8 showing that both the lowest-frequency optical
phonons, predicted at 36 cm–1 (Tirrep) and 37 cm–1 (Eirrep) with PBEsol,43 are responsible
for most of the low temperature NTE, that is, up to ∼70% of
the CTE in the vicinity of 30 K according to the Debye–Einstein
QHA calculations.46 Intrapolyhedral bond
angle O–M–O variations for these lowest-frequency vibrational
modes of α-ZrW2O8 were achieved through
libration/translation of WO4 building blocks.

Lattice
vibration contributions from phonon calculations were used
to derive thermodynamic functions fitted to the Vinet EoS. The electronic
contribution to the thermodynamic properties is negligible because
the band gap computed with PBEsol for orthorhombic Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is 3.20 eV, that is, comparable
to the value of 3.45 eV obtained for α-ZrW2O8 at the same level of theory.43 Within the QHA, the molar isobaric heat capacity, CP, was calculated as a function of temperature
and pressure according to 6  where V(T,P) is
the equilibrium volume
at T and P, and the pressure is
set to the reference
ambient pressure for the standard state adopted in calorimetric data,
that is, P = 1 bar and where the molar entropy, S, is expressed as 7  with the molar isochoric
heat capacity, CV, given
by 8  where
the remaining variables in eqs 6–8 have been defined in eqs 1 and 2. The molar isochoric capacity
and isobaric heat capacity calculated at constant atmospheric pressure
for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 are
displayed in Figure 7, along with CP lattice
dynamics results for α-ZrW2O8 calculated
up to ∼431 K (i.e., the temperature corresponding to the α
→ β structural phase transition in ZrW2O8) using DFPT/PBEsol within the QHA.43 The computed standard molar heat capacity of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 at T = 298.15
K is CP0 = 287.6 J·mol–1·K–1, which is significantly larger than the
corresponding value of CP0 = 192.2 J·mol–1·K–1 calculated for α-ZrW2O8. At 960 K, the highest temperature considered
in this study for CP,
the difference between the calculated CP and CV remains small, that is, only ∼4 J·mol–1·K–1. At this temperature, CP is only ∼6% below its theoretical
Dulong–Petit asymptotic value of CP = 3nR = 424.0 J·mol–1·K–1, where n is the number
of atoms per formula unit and R (8.314 J·mol–1·K–1) is the universal gas
constant.

Figure 7 Molar isochoric (CV) and isobaric (CP)
heat capacities of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated at constant atmospheric pressure using DFPT at
the GGA/PBEsol level within the QHA. CP results for α-ZrW2O8 calculated with GGA/PBEsol (ref (43)) are also displayed for comparison.

Figure 8 shows the
thermal evolution of the molar entropy of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 calculated at equilibrium volume with eq 7 using DFPT/PBEsol. The
calculated molar entropy features the typical logarithmic increase
according to the Boltzmann’s entropy formula, S = kB·log(W), where W is the number of microstates in the system. The standard
molar entropy is predicted to be S0 =
321.9 J·mol–1·K–1 at T = 298.15 K, that is appreciably larger than the corresponding
value of 229.2 J·mol–1·K–1 predicted for α-ZrW2O8 at the same level
of theory.

at the same level of theory is represented (ref (43)).

3 Conclusions
Using DFPT with the PBEsol
XC functional, the crystal structure,
phonon, and thermomechanical properties of the orthorhombic NTE material
Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 have been
investigated computationally for the first time. The results obtained
for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 with
this approach have been systematically and extensively compared with
the available experimental data for this material, as well as with
previous results for the notorious α-ZrW2O8 NTE compound.

The Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 structure
optimized with GGA/PBEsol at T = 0 K possesses crystal
unit-cell parameters of a = 9.432, b = 12.432, and c = 9.250 Å, with a unit-cell
volume ∼2.3% larger than the estimate of V = 1059.34(4) Å3 obtained at T =
60 K by Cetinkol and Wilkinson using neutron diffraction data.

The bulk modulus predicted for Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 using the Vinet EoS is K0 = 63.6 GPa at room temperature, which is in close agreement
with the experimental estimate of 61.3(8) at T =
296 K. At T = 0 K, the nine independent elastic constants
in the stiffness matrix calculated with DFPT/PBEsol for the orthorhombic
Zr2(WO4)(PO4) structure are: C11 = 150.0 GPa, C22 = 100.9 GPa, C33 = 139.4 GPa, C44 = 31.4 GPa, C55 = 51.6 GPa, C66 = 29.8 GPa, C12 = 39.4 GPa, C13 = 76.6 GPa, and C23 = 39.0 GPa. The
VRH shear and Young’s moduli, Poisson’s ratio, Vickers
microhardness, and Debye temperature for polycrystalline Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 were computed from elastic
constants, that is, G = 37.2 GPa, E = 95.7 GPa, ν = 0.287, Hv = 4.3
GPa, and θD = 413 K, respectively.

The computed
mean linear CTE is −3.1 × 10–6 K−1 in the temperature range ∼0–70
K, in line with the mean linear CTE of −3 × 10–6 K−1 measured by Evans et al. using XRD measurements
in the temperature range ∼50–450 K. The mean Grüneisen
parameter controlling the thermal expansion of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 is negative below 205 K, with
a minimum of −2.1 at 10 K. The calculated standard molar heat
capacity and entropy are CP0 = 287.6 and S0 = 321.9 J·mol–1·K–1, respectively.

Results reported in this study
show that the DFPT/PBEsol computational
approach is sufficiently accurate for assessing or predicting the
relationship between structural and thermomechanical properties of
NTE materials.

4 Methods
4.1 Computational
Methods
First-principles
calculations were performed using DFT/DFPT implemented in the Vienna
Ab initio Simulation package55 (VASP).
The XC energy was computed using the GGA with the Perdew, Burke, and
Ernzerhof parameterization revised for solids (PBEsol).42 The PBEsol XC functional showed superior accuracy
over standard functionals, such as PBE, in previous computational
studies of the NTE material α-ZrW2O8.43,44 The accuracy of our DFT/DFPT computational approach was extensively
tested in previous lattice dynamics studies.52,56−60

The projector augmented wave (PAW) method61,62 was utilized to describe the interaction between valence electrons
and ionic cores. The O(2s2,2p4), P(3s2,3p3), W(6s2,5d4), and Zr(4p6,5s2,4d2) electrons were treated explicitly
as valence electrons in the Kohn–Sham (KS) equations, and the
remaining core electrons together with the nuclei were represented
by PAW pseudopotentials. The KS equation was solved using the blocked
Davidson63 iterative matrix diagonalization
scheme. The plane-wave cutoff energy for the electronic wavefunctions
was set to 500 eV, ensuring the total energy of the system to be converged
to within 1 meV/atom.

A 3D-periodic unit-cell approach was utilized,
with the orthorhombic
crystal unit cell of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 [space group Pbcn, IT no. 60, setting
no. 3 Pnca (c, a, b); Z = 4] solved by Evans et
al.31 chosen as the initial structure in
relaxation calculations. Because of the large size of the unit cell
(68 atoms, V0 = 1056.34 Å3), a k-point mesh of 5 × 5 × 5 was utilized
to sample the Brillouin zone using the Monkhorst–Pack k-point scheme.64 Unit-cell relaxation
calculations were initially carried out until the Hellmann–Feynman
forces acting on atoms were converged within 0.01 eV/Å, without
symmetry constraints imposed. The structure optimized from total-energy
minimization was then relaxed with respect to Hellmann–Feynman
forces with a convergence tolerance set to 0.001 eV/Å, and DFPT
linear response calculations were carried out with VASP to determine
the phonon frequencies and elastic properties. Using the QHA—which
introduces a volume dependence of phonon frequencies as a part of
the anharmonic effect47—the thermal
properties of Zr2(WO4)(PO4)2 were derived from phonon calculations. This computational approach
was validated in previous studies to successfully predict the properties
of various Zr-containing compounds and crystalline materials.52,56−58,65−68
