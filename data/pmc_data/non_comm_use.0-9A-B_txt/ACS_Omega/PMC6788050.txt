The
oily wastewater generated in the industrial field is adversely
affecting the environment, while the current methods for oil–water
separation are complex and costly. Therefore, it is significant to
use low cost and environmentally friendly materials to prepare a smart
responsive superhydrophobic coating for the effective separation of
oil–water mixtures. In this paper, a fluorine-free copolymer
with pH responsiveness was fabricated by a solution impregnation method,
and it was compounded by silica nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxane
to prepare a superhydrophobic coating on the paper and cotton fabric.
The prepared superhydrophobic coating remained in the superhydrophobic
state after the alkali treatment, while it would be converted into
the hydrophilic state after the acid treatment. Therefore, the pH-responsive
superhydrophobic coating will be applied in controlled selective oil–water
separation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A lot of oily wastewater is produced in the fields of printing,
textile, food processing, leather, and petrochemical industries. The
separation of oil–water mixtures has become an urgent problem
to be solved in industrial production, so it is very important to
design materials for effective separation of oil–water mixtures.1−4 The current methods for oil–water separation are complex,
time-consuming, costly, and prone to secondary pollution. In addition,
there is no switchable wettability in these materials, which limits
their practical and commercial applications to some extent. Therefore,
it is significant to design smart materials with switchable surface
wettability.5−8

Smart response materials refer to the materials whose surface
energy
and surface microstructure will be changed under the stimulation of
pH, temperature, light, electric potential, and so on, resulting in
transition in surface wettability.9−18 These materials can be used in the separation of oil–water
mixtures via single-phase selective absorption or filtration. Therefore,
the development of smart response materials has become a hotspot of
present research. Liu et al. prepared a ZnO nanorod/epoxy composite
membrane which achieved reversible transition of wettability by the
UV-induced photocatalytic effect.19 Geissler
et al. developed superhydrophobic paper with temperature response
characteristics using cellulose stearoyl ester solutions and nanoparticles.20 Zheng et al. fabricated a nanostructured polyaniline
that can induce oil–water separation by electrical selective
penetration.21 However, most of these smart
response surfaces require high cost and complicated processes, which
limit their applications. The pH responsiveness is more favored because
of easy operation, fast response, and there is no need for additional
equipment. There are protonatable groups including carboxyl groups,
pyridines, and amines in usual pH-responsive materials. Xu et al.
fabricated a superamphiphobic coating using coordination chemistry,
showing a special capability to control oil–water separation
and remove water from bulk oil selectively.22 Wang et al. successfully prepared pH-responsive fabrics by in situ-growing
Ag nanocrystals on the fabric and modifying them with a mixture of
methyl-terminated thiol and carboxyl-terminated thiol.23 However, most of these coatings are prepared
using precious materials such as Ag or fluorine-containing substances
which are considered to be harmful to the environment. Therefore,
it is an inevitable trend to use environmental friendly materials
with low cost to prepare smart responsive superhydrophobic coatings.

In our work, a random copolymer is synthesized by solution-processable
free radical polymerization using inexpensive fluorine-free monomers.
Silica nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxanes (SiO2 NPs/PDMS)
are compounded to build a high-roughness surface because of the strong
interaction between SiO2 NPs/PDMS and the covalent linkage
of the triblock copolymer. The paper and cotton fabric are then selected
as the substrate for the superhydrophobic coating because of their
low cost, environmental friendliness, and permeability, and they are
coated with the prepared pH responsive copolymer to obtain a smart
response superhydrophobic capability. The test of surface wettability
proves that the coating is superhydrophobic in both neutral and alkali
environments. In an acidic environment, the coating will change from
a superhydrophobic state to a hydrophilic state, which can be used
for efficient selective oil–water separation to meet the demand
in different environments. The superhydrophobic coating prepared by
the method in this paper is considered to have a good application
prospect.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Surface
Morphology Analysis
In order
to study the effect of the prepared copolymer and SiO2 NPs
on the surface morphology of the samples, the surface morphologies
of the original samples, the samples coated with the copolymer, and
the samples coated with copolymer and SiO2 NPs/PDMS are
observed and analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images.
For the original samples (Figures 1a–c and 2a–c),
it can be intuitively seen that the native striations of the fiber
structure are obvious and the surface is flat without an uneven structure.
For the samples coated with a pH-responsive copolymer (Figures 1d–f and 2d–f), it can be seen that the surface of the fiber
is covered with a thin coating of copolymer with certain roughness,
which is conducive to enhancing the hydrophobic properties of the
substrate.24−26 For the samples modified by the copolymer compounded
by the SiO2 NPs/PDMS (Figures 1g–i and 2g–i),
it can be clearly observed that SiO2 NPs and pH-responsive
copolymer coating are deposited on the surface, showing a state of
unevenness. Compared with the above two kinds of samples, the surface
roughness is greatly promoted after adding SiO2 nanoparticles
into the copolymer.

In addition, the effects of acid and alkali on the surface morphology
of fibers are also studied, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. It can be
seen from the figures that there is no significant change in the surface
structure of modified paper and cotton fabric treated by the acid
and alkali. The original rough structure is still maintained. It turns
out that different pH solutions have no obvious effect on the surface
of modified paper and cotton fabric.

2.2 Structure Characterization
The molecular
structure of pH-responsive copolymer was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) (Figure 5a). The −CH2 peak of poly(butyl methacrylate) (PBMA) was observed at 1.4 ppm.
The −N–(CH3)2 and −N–CH2 peaks of poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)
were located at 2.23 and 2.3 ppm. The groups appeared at 3.97 ppm
were contributed to −CH2OH and −CH2 linked to an ester group of PDMAEMA. The Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FT-IR) studies (Figure 5b) were carried out on the copolymer monomers, prepared
copolymer, SiO2 NPs/PDMS, and copolymer compounded by SiO2 NPs/PDMS to identify the chemical structure of the synthesized
products. The band around 3427 cm–1 was contributed
to the stretching vibration of −OH in poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)
(PHEMA). The absorption at 2954 cm–1 was ascribed
to the C–H stretching of PBMA. The peaks at 1720 and 1166 cm–1 corresponded to the C=O and C–N stretching
peaks in PDMAEMA segments, respectively. All the characteristic absorption
peaks could be observed in the spectra of the corresponding monomers
with the same wave numbers.27,28 For SiO2/PDMS, C–H bond was observed at around 2958 cm–1. The characteristic peak assigned to Si–CH3 of
PDMS was located near 800 cm–1. The Si–O–Si
stretching vibration appeared at 1087 cm–1. All
of the above characteristic absorption peaks were found in the spectrum
of pH-responsive copolymer compounded by SiO2 NPs/PDMS.
The 1H NMR and FT-IR results showed that the copolymer
was synthesized successfully and SiO2 NPs was introduced
into the pH-responsive copolymer.29

2.3 XPS Analysis
X-ray
photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) shown in Figure 6 was analyzed to verify the successful loading of the
copolymer on the paper and the mechanism of pH responsiveness. For
original paper, Figure 6a showed that only C and O elements emerged at 283 and 530 eV, respectively.
Compared with the original paper, the N 1s peak at 399.1 eV appeared
on the surface of copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated
paper, which was ascribed to the tertiary amine of PDMAEMA. After
immersing in a pH 1 solution, a distinctive peak was attributed to
Cl 2p. The N 1s peaks at 399.1 and 401.3 eV (Figure 6c) corresponded to the tertiary amine and
the quaternary amine, indicating that the PDMAEMA chain was protonated.
When treated by using alkali, the Na peak appeared. The N 1s peak
was only observed at 399.1 eV (Figure 6d), which was due to the deprotonation of PDMAEMA.30−32 In terms of atomic content, the N atom content of the modified paper
without the acid/alkali treatment was 0.11%. After the acid treatment,
the N atom content on the surface of the paper increased to 0.55%.
This was caused by the quaternary amines produced by the protonation
of PDMAEMA. After the alkali treatment, the content of the N atom
on the surface of the paper did not substantially change, corresponding
to the tertiary amine in the PDMAEMA segment. This result further
demonstrated that the wettability of the paper could be altered by
the protonation and deprotonation processes of the PDMAEMA segment
in different pH solutions.

Figure 6 (a) XPS spectra. N 1s core level of (b) copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated paper, (c) modified paper treated by using
acid, and (d) modified paper treated by using alkali, respectively.

There are ionizable tertiary amine groups in PDMAEMA,
which can
be protonated and deprotonated, leading to changes in the wettability
of pH-responsive coatings as shown in Figure 7. When in an acidic environment, the tertiary
amine groups in PDMAEMA will be protonated to form positively charged
ammonium groups. Molecular hydrogen bonds between the groups bind
to surrounding water molecules, turning the coating into a hydrophilic
state. When in a neutral or alkaline condition, tertiary amine groups
will be deprotonated and Cl– in the quaternary ammonium
will be removed, which will keep the coating in a superhydrophobic
state.

Figure 7 Mechanism of pH-responsive coating. At low pH values, the coating
transitions to a superhydrophilic state. At high pH, the coating remains
in a superhydrophobic state.

2.4 TG Analysis
It could be seen from Figure 8 that the original
paper lost approximately 90% weight within the temperature range.
The weight loss of the copolymer-coated paper and copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated paper was about 80 and 76%, respectively,
indicating that the paper was modified successfully. The amount of
the copolymer and SiO2 NPs/PDMS was about 10 and 4 wt %,
respectively. This phenomenon demonstrated that the copolymer interacted
with the micro–nanostructure to create a superhydrophobic surface.31,33,34

Figure 8 TGA curves of original paper, copolymer-coated
paper, and copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated paper.

2.5 Surface Wettability and
pH-Responsiveness
The water contact angle (WCA) of the coating
was measured by selecting
several points of the same sample randomly at ambient temperature.
To observe the superhydrophobic stability and pH response of the coating,
methylene blue-dyed deionized water was randomly dropped on the surface
of the modified paper, acid-treated paper, and alkali-treated paper.
As shown in Figure 9, the paper treated differently was initially in a superhydrophobic
state. The surface of the acid treated paper was gradually infiltrated
by the droplets, indicating that the paper was converted to a hydrophilic
state. However, for the modified paper and alkali-treated paper, the
shape of droplets remained unchanged after 30 min.

Figure 9 Photographs of the droplets
from the (a) front view and (b) top
view on the surface of modified paper, acid-treated paper, and alkali-treated
paper.

As shown in Figure 10, the WCA of the modified
paper and alkali-treated paper reached
above 150° and remained substantially constant. The WCA of the
acid-treated paper was initially larger than 150°, but it began
to decrease until it become 0° after 30 min. The modified paper
was affected by amine protonation and deprotonation, resulting in
the change of surface wettability. In addition, a graph describing
the change of WCA with time was also drawn in Figure 11. The coated paper still remained superhydrophobic
after 3 h. The result further illustrated the stability and pH responsiveness
of the prepared superhydrophobic coating.35−37

of the water droplets on the modified paper.

of WCA of different paper with time.

2.6 Mechanical Durability Test
The mechanical
durability was characterized by the abrasion test. The superhydrophobic
paper was placed face-down to the sandpaper with a weight of 200 g
and pulled 20 cm back and forth along the horizontal line as a cycle,
which was shown in Figure 12a. The paper was dragged at different cycles to determine
the change in the contact angle. Figure 12b demonstrated that the WCA of the superhydrophobic
surface changed with the increase of the pulling cycles. It could
be seen that the contact angle ranged from 165° to 151°
and it still was more than 150° after 30 cycles. The result indicated
that there was a strong bonding force between the superhydrophobic
coating and the substrate.

as-prepared paper. (b)
Plot of the WCA after abrasion cycles.

2.7 Oil–Water Separation
The oil–water
separation experiment was carried out on a device as shown in Figure 13 to verify the
function of superhydrophobic paper. The copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated paper was fixed in the middle of two glass containers.
A mixture of methylene blue-dyed water and oil red O-dyed oil (hexane,
1,2-dichloroethane, and toluene) was poured into the upper half of
the glassware. Taking 1,2-dichloroethane as an example, because of
the hydrophobic and lipophilic nature of the modified paper, the bottom
heavy oil 1,2-dichloroethane rapidly penetrated the paper into the
lower half of the glassware while the water remained on the responsive
paper.38

Figure 13 Oil–water separation process of
copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated paper (taking 1,2-dichloroethane
as an example).

It can be concluded
that the separation efficiency of the superhydrophobic
paper can reach more than 98.5% for various oil–water mixtures,
indicating that the superhydrophobic paper possesses excellent separation
performance for oil–water mixtures (Figure 14a). Separation flux is also a key parameter
to characterize the separation performance of superhydrophobic paper.
The separation fluxes of as-prepared paper for various mixtures are
between 39 and 74 L·m–2·h–2 through calculation (Figure 14b). The recycle performance of superhydrophobic paper
was tested. As shown in Figure 15, after 30 separation cycles, the separation efficiency
of superhydrophobic paper can still reach more than 98%.39−42

Figure 14 (a) Separation efficiency and (b) separation flux of superhydrophobic
paper for various oil–water mixtures.

Figure 15 Separation
efficiency of superhydrophobic paper varies with the
number of cycles.

In order to further
investigate the effect of pH on the performance
of oil–water separation, the test of oil–water separation
was conducted on acid-/alkali-treated paper. For the acid-treated
paper, a mixture of methylene blue-dyed water and oil red O dyed hexane
was poured into the upper of the glass container. Because the modified
paper was converted to the superoleophobicity state under the acidic
condition, water permeated through the paper into the lower glass
vessel, while hexane was collected in the upper vessel (Figure 16a). A mixture of
1,2-dichloroethane (oil red O dyeing) and water (methylene blue dyeing)
was used to verify the oil–water separation ability of the
alkali-treated paper (Figure 16b). It could be found that the wettability of the paper treated
by using alkali was completely in contrast to that treated by using
acid. When the coated paper was treated by using alkali, 1,2-dichloroethane
passed through the paper driven by gravity while water was retained.
Therefore, the selective oil–water separation was achieved
by altering the wettability of the pH-responsive coating.

separation process of (a) acid-treated paper and

3 Conclusions
In this paper, a pH responsive
random copolymer is prepared by
a simple solution impregnation method, and it is compounded by SiO2 NPs/PDMS to prepare a fluorine-free superhydrophobic coating.
The results of characterizations such as SEM and FT-IR show that the
prepared copolymer compounded by SiO2 NPs/PDMS is successfully
coated on the substrate. The tests of WCA and oil–water separation
show that the prepared coating successfully obtains pH-responsive
superhydrophobic capability. The WCA of pH-responsive coating reaches
more than 150° in both neutral and alkali environments. After
the acidic treatment, the coating transitions to a superhydrophilic
state because of the protonation of the responsive monomer PDMAEMA.
The pH-responsive superhydrophobic coating prepared in this paper
can be applied well to both paper and cotton fabric. Therefore, it
has a good application prospect in effective oil–water separation
in industries.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Butyl methacrylate (BMA),
2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate
(DMAEMA) were all purchased from Ivkeyan Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.,
Shanghai, China. PDMS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All the above
regents were used as received. 2,2-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) obtained
from Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, Tianjin, China was recrystallized
from ethanol for further use. The paper and cotton fabric used for
modification were purchased from a local store.

4.2 Synthesis of pH-Responsive Copolymer
As shown in Scheme 1, the copolymer was
prepared by polymerization under anhydrous and
oxygen-free conditions. BMA (5.68 g, 0.04 mol), HEMA (0.52 g, 0.004
mol), and DMAEMA (6.28 g, 0.04 mol) were dissolved in anhydrous toluene
(30 g) and then AIBN (0.1 g) was added as the initiator. The mixture
was placed in a three-necked round-bottom flask. Nitrogen gas was
introduced into the flask for 40 min to get rid of the oxygen to facilitate
the polymerization. The sealed reaction flask was placed in a 70 °C
constant temperature oil bath with stirring for 6 h. Then, the obtained
solution was cooled to room temperature and purified by rotary evaporation
to remove the solvent. The resultant copolymer was dissolved in acetone
and precipitated in hexane several times and dried under vacuum at
50 °C.

methacrylate-co-2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)
(PBMA-co-PHEMA-co-PDMAEMA)
4.3 Preparation of pH-Responsive
Coating Solution
Silica nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs)
were first dissolved
in 20 g of anhydrous toluene with subsequent addition of PDMS and
the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min. Then, the prepared pH-responsive
copolymer was added and the solution was dispersed under ultrasonic
conditions for 30 min to form a uniform and stable solution.

4.4 Fabrication of pH-Responsive Paper
The preparation
of the pH-responsive paper is illustrated in Scheme 2. The paper and cotton
fabric to be used were cut into a size of 3 cm × 3 cm and washed
with acetone, absolute ethanol, and distilled water, respectively,
to remove impurities. The clean paper and cotton fabric were separately
immersed in the prepared copolymer solution and the pH-responsive
solution containing SiO2 NPs/PDMS for 30 min. After the
completion of soaking, the paper and cotton fabric were dried in an
oven at 100 °C for 1 h to complete the cross-linking reaction.

4.5 Selective Oil–Water
Separation Experiments
Different oil–water mixtures
were prepared to test the selective
oil–water separation function of the pH-responsive coating.
The separation performances of the superhydrophobic paper were characterized
by the separation efficiency, separation flux, and cycle usage. The
separation efficiency is calculated by formula 1 as follows 1  where V1 is the
volume of oil collected in the oil–water separation experiment
and V0 is the volume of oil before the
separation experiment. Separation flux can be obtained from formula 2 2  where V is the volume
of
oil passing the superhydrophobic paper in time t and S is the effective contact area between the oil–water
mixture and the superhydrophobic paper.

4.6 Characterization
The surface morphologies
of all the coated paper and cotton fabric were examined by a SEM (SU-8010,
Hitachi, Japan). FT-IR was recorded using an infrared spectrometer
(8400S, Shimadzu, Japan) at room temperature. The structure of the
copolymer dissolved in CDCl3 was analyzed by 1H NMR (AVANCE III HD 600 MHz, Bruker, Germany) and all chemical shifts
were recorded in ppm. XPS (Axis Ultpa, Kratos analytical, UK) with
an Al Kα X-ray source at 10 kV and 10 mA was conducted to determine
the surface element of samples. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Q600SDT,
TA Instruments, USA) was performed on the original sample, copolymer-coated
sample, and copolymer–SiO2 NPs/PDMS-coated sample
under nitrogen gas with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and scanned
temperature ranging from ambient temperature to 700 °C. The surface
wettability and pH responsiveness of the coating were characterized
by WCA measured on goniometer (SDC-200, Sindin, China). The bonding
force between the coating and substrate was tested by measuring the
change of the contact angle after the abrasion test on the surface
of superhydrophobic paper.
