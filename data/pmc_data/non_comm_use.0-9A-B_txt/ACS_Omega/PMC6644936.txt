A simple, easy, and rapid process of fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces on magnesium alloy
AZ31 by a one-step immersion at room temperature was developed. The
myristic acid-modified micro-/nanostructured surfaces showed static
water contact angles over 150° and water contact angle hysteresis
below 10°, thus illustrating superhydrophobic property. The shortest
treatment time for obtaining the superhydrophobic surfaces was 30
s. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that crystalline
solid myristic acid could be formed on a Mg alloy using a suitable
molar ratio of Ce ions and myristic acid. The contact angle hysteresis
was lowered with an increase in the immersion time. Potentiodynamic
polarization curve measurements revealed that the corrosion resistance
of AZ31 treated by the immersion process improved considerably by
the formation of superhydrophobic surfaces. The chemical durability
of the superhydrophobic surfaces fabricated on AZ31 was also examined.
The static water contact angle values for the superhydrophobic surfaces
after immersion in aqueous solutions at pHs 4, 7, and 10 for 12 h
were estimated to be 90 ± 2°, 119 ± 2°, and 138
± 2°, respectively, demonstrating that their chemical durability
in a basic solution was high.

1 Introduction
Many
superhydrophobic plant leaves are found in natural world,
such as those of lotus, rice, and taro plants. Superhydrophobic surfaces
have a static water contact angle over 150° and a sliding angle
below 10°. Such natural systems can guide the construction and
design of artificial superhydrophobic surfaces. Studies on these leaves
revealed that a superhydrophobic surface with a large contact angle
requires the cooperation of hierarchical micro- and nanostructures.1 The hierarchical structure requires to be covered
by hydrophobic groups having a low surface energy, such as −CH3 or CF3 groups. The existence of hydrophobic functional
groups on such hierarchical structures results in superhydrophobicity.2−4 Fabrication methods and potential applications on the superhydrophobic
surfaces are attracting much interest.5−12 Thus, superhydrophobic surfaces have been artificially fabricated
on various material surfaces such as polymers,13 metal oxides,14,15 and metals16−18 and are of special interest in both scientific and industrial fields
owing to their superior characteristics such as self-cleaning,19−21 antisticking,22−25 anti-icing,26,27 antifogging,28 and oil–water separation properties.29,30

Recently, the corrosion resistance performance of superhydrophobic
coatings fabricated on various metals and alloys has attracted much
attention31−34 because information in this regard can provide a solution to the
long-standing issues on corrosion of metals and metal alloys.35−37 Thus, to improve the corrosion resistance of them, formation of
superhydrophobic surfaces on various metal surfaces, such as steel,
copper, zinc, and aluminum38−41 by various methods such as the sol–gel process,42 electrodeposition,43 electrospinning,44 hydrothermal techniques,45 chemical vapor deposition,46 and spray coating,47 has been
developed. Liu et al. reported the fabrication of a superhydrophobic
surface on a copper substrate by a simple technique of immersion
into methanol solution containing perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane [CF3(CF2)5(CH2)2SiCl3] and revealed that its corrosion resistance performance in
3 mass % NaCl aqueous solution was improved by the formation of a
superhydrophobic coating.37 Zhang et al.
demonstrated that anticorrosive superhydrophobic surfaces were formed
on an Al alloy substrate by a facile one-step electrochemical deposition
and revealed that the corrosion resistance performance was improved
considerably by the superhydrophobic coating.48

Magnesium (Mg) is one of the lightest engineering metals among
the practically applied metals. Thus, Mg and its alloys can be applied
in aerospace engineering, as well as in airplanes, trains, and automobiles.49−52 The greatest advantage of Mg alloys is their light weight, which
has enabled us to achieve energy saving in the abovementioned applications
through the use of steel-based hybrid materials. In such transportation-related
applications, Mg has more superior density and specific strength than
those of aluminum (Al) and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer, but it
shows a much lower corrosion resistance. Corrosion of Mg alloys occurs
when they come into contact with water. Therefore, it is essential
to prevent such alloys from contacting with aqueous environments to
prevent the corrosion
reaction. A superhydrophobic coating would enable Mg alloys to improve
the corrosion resistance performance because it would hinder the contact
of surfaces with aqueous environments.

Jiang et al. developed
a method for introducing superhydrophobic
surfaces on a Mg–Li alloy by combining the process of chemical
etching to fabricate micronanoscale hierarchical structures and the
immersion process using fluoroalkylsilane (FAS) molecules to impart
low surface energy to the hierarchically structured surfaces.53 The corrosion resistance of the Mg–Li
alloy was improved greatly by the formation of a superhydrophobic
surface. However, this is a multistep and time-consuming process that
requires about 14 h for completion. In our previous work, a time-saving
method for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces on Mg alloy AZ31
was developed.54 The procedure involved
two-step immersion using cerium oxide, FAS molecules, and a catalyst54 and required less than 1 h. Detailed electrochemical
and immersion tests revealed that the corrosion resistance of the
superhydrophobic Mg alloy was improved due to its superhydrophobicity
and inhibitory effect of cerium oxide against corrosion.55 However, from an industrial viewpoint, the treatment
time should be further reduced. Myristic acid can be one of the candidate
materials to impart hydrophobicity to alloy surfaces in short time
because it has hydrophobic and carboxyl functional groups in the molecular
framework and the carboxyl groups as the anchor group can bind to
metal oxide surfaces for 1 h.56 In addition,
the cost for this process is high because of the use of the perfluoro
reagent and the catalyst. Low-cost, easy, and high-efficiency procedures
suitable for mass production are desirable for industrial applications.
Thus, the development of an effective one-step fabrication method
for the production of superhydrophobic surfaces without using the
perfluoro molecule and the catalyst is highly desirable. By controlling
the composition and concentration of the precursor solution, we can
realize a metal coating having micronanoscale roughness and hydrophobicity,
i.e., superhydrophobicity, in a short time. In addition, we demonstrated
for the first time that crystalline solid myristic acid could be formed
on a Mg alloy using a suitable molar ratio of Ce ions and myristic
acid.

In this article, a rapid, simple, easy, and low-cost approach
for
fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces composed of CeO2 having
an inhibitory effect against corrosion and crystalline solid myristic
acid showing hydrophobicity on a Mg alloy at room temperature is discussed.
The procedure is facile and does not require special equipment for
operation. Moreover, it can be executed without heat treatment or
using perfluoro molecules, and the shortest process time could be
below 1 min. The corrosion resistance of superhydrophobically treated
Mg alloy AZ31 was investigated. Moreover, the chemical durability
of the superhydrophobic surfaces fabricated on the Mg alloy was demonstrated.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
static water contact angles of the AZ31 surfaces after immersion for
180 s into the mixed solutions prepared with different volume ratios
of solutions A and B. The sample (a180) fabricated from the solution
containing only Ce(NO3)3 showed a static water
contact angle of 80.7 ± 2°, demonstrating the hydrophilic
property. On the other hand, when solution A was added to the solution,
the static water contact angle increased. The static water contact
angles tended to increase with an increase in the volume ratio of
solution A in the mixed solution. When the myristic acid content in
the mixed solution was 0.7, the static contact angle was found to
be 156.2 ± 2° (characteristic of a superhydrophobic surface),
the highest value among those for all samples. When the ratio of solution
A to solution B was more than 0.8, the static water contact angles
of the sample surfaces decreased gradually. The static water contact
angle of the sample (k180) prepared from only solution A (myristic
acid) was estimated to be 116.7 ± 2°, which was higher than
a previously reported value for myristic acid on a smooth surface.57 The pristine AZ31 surface was not smooth and
showed some degree of roughness. According to the Wenzel equation,1 the relationship between the surface roughness
factor and the measured static water contact angle is described as
follows 1  where r is
the roughness
factor, defined as the ratio between the real and projected contact
areas at the solid–liquid interface, and θc and θ show the contact angles on the rough and smooth surfaces,
respectively. The ideal water contact angle of the flat Si surface
covered with a −CH3 group-terminated monolayer is
in the range of 105–109°. Given that θc = 116.7° and θ =109°, r is found
to be 1.38 using the Wenzel equation. When a water droplet was dropped
on the AZ31 surface covered with the myristic molecules, the actual
contact area at the solid–liquid interface was 1.38 times of
the projected area. Thus, the static water contact angle of the sample
(k180) surface is considered to be slightly higher than the previously
reported value.

Figure 1 Static water contact angles of AZ31 surfaces after immersion
for
180 s into mixed solutions prepared with different volume ratios of
myristic acid–ethanol (solution A) and cerium nitrate aqueous
solution (solution B). All plots show the averaged values of water
contact angles measured at five different points on the same samples.
The error bars for each plot indicate the maximum and minimum water
contact angles.

Figure 2a–j
shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the different sample
surfaces. Figure 3a–j
shows an enlarged version of Figure 2a–j. When the ratio of the volumes of solution
A to solution B is in the range 0.1–0.4, as shown in Figure 2a–d, the surfaces
are covered with films that have some cracks. These relatively large
cracks divide the whole surface coating into pieces. Several small
microcracks exist within each piece. These cracks in the coating film
might have been formed by shrinkage in volume due to evaporation of
water molecules contained in the coating film, thereby allowing cracks
to form. The shrinkage could occur by introduction of the samples
into the vacuum chamber of SEM. Figure SI1a,b shows SEM images of the film surfaces fabricated from an aqueous
solution containing Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, that is, only solution B, by the immersion process. The film also
had some cracks, and the film denseness was not high. On the other
hand, when the volume ratio is 0.4–0.7, the surface morphologies
change considerably. Many nanoplates formed at fairly tilted angles
with respect to the surface are observed on the surfaces. The occurrence
of vertically aligned nanoplates becomes predominant as the ratio
increases up to 0.7. The nanoplates exhibited a thickness below 100
nm and an edge length in the range 200–1000 nm. Moreover, several
individual crystals having a length over 1 μm were also observed.
The agglomeration of the nanoplates could result in an irregular surface
morphology with nanoscale spaces composed of concavity and convexity.
Such surface morphology is better suited for fabricating a superhydrophobic
surface. In the case of the volume ratio of solution A to solution
B being 0.8 and 0.9, partial aggregation of the nanoplates was observed
on the sample surfaces, as shown in Figures 2h and 3h. As shown
in Figure 3h,i, the
shapes of the nanoplates in the aggregations were almost same as those
in Figure 3g. When
the volume ratio was 1.0, i.e., when only myristic acid was used,
no nanoplates were observed. The formation of several fine particles
was observed on the surface. Figure 4 shows the relationship between the surface roughness, Ra, of the sample and the volume ratio of solutions
A and B. When the ratio was in the range 0.5–0.8, the surface
roughness was found to be in the range 2.0–2.5 μm, which
was relatively high compared to those for other samples. SEM observations
suggested aggregation of nanoplates on their surfaces. Thus, the aggregation
of nanoplates results
in an increase of the surface roughness. From these results, it can
be concluded that the volume ratio of solution A to solution B that
is the most suitable for fabricating the superhydrophobic surface
is 0.7, i.e., samples (h60) and (h180).

To investigate the effect of the
immersion time on the water contact
angles on sample (h), some samples (h) were fabricated for different
immersion times. Changes in the static water contact angles on samples
(h) as a function of immersion time are shown in Figure 5a. The field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FESEM) images and topographic images of the sample
surfaces for (h10), (h30), (h60), (h180), (h300), and (h600) are shown
in Figures SI2 and SI3, respectively. When
the immersion time was 10 s, the static water contact angle value
for the surface of sample (h10) was found to be 147.5 ± 2°,
characteristic of a highly hydrophobic surface. As shown in Figures SI2a and SI3a, the surface was rough
and showed a root mean roughness, Rrms, of 158.8 nm. Such a rough structure can increase the hydrophobicity.
When the immersion time was more than 30 s, the static water contact
angle for each sample was over 150° and all surfaces became superhydrophobic.
This means that the shortest immersion time required for obtaining
the superhydrophobic surface is 30 s. As shown in Figures SI2b–f and SI3b–f, the roughness of
the sample surfaces seemed to increase with an increase in the immersion
time and hierarchical structures on the micro- and nanometer scale
could be realized, leading to the fabrication of a superhydrophobic
surface. The advancing (θA) and receding (θR) water contact angles of the samples (h) as a function of
immersion time are shown in Figure 5b. The surfaces of all of the samples (h) showed advancing
water contact angles of more than 150° but receding water contact
angles in the range of 143–150°, depending on the immersion
time. The surfaces treated for 5 and 20 min showed low contact angle
hysteresis (<5°), although they were rough, indicating that
the treated surfaces gained water-repellent properties. On the other
hand, the surfaces treated for less than 3 min showed contact angle
hysteresis in the range of 5–10°. One plausible cause
of the increase in water contact angle hysteresis might be an increase
of the surface roughness. The motion of the water drop on the rough
surface could be pinned by the surface roughness. As mentioned above,
the Wenzel model can interpret the relationship between the surface
roughness and the water contact angle.58 According to the Wenzel model, it can be considered that on the
rough surface the free energy at the interface per unit area increases
depending on the change in surface area due to the morphological changes;
thus, the contact line between a rough surface and a liquid could
increase. Consequently, the liquid can get completely in contact with
the surface, wetting the rough surface completely. This leads to a
large contact area between the liquid and the surface, thus resulting
in pinning of the water droplet on the rough surface. Another cause
could be that the surface could not be treated uniformly because of
the short immersion time.

AZ31 surfaces after
immersion as a function of immersion time. (b) Advancing (θA) and receding (θR) water contact angles

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
of sample (h) surface fabricated
by immersion for 30 min is shown in Figure 6. The thickness of the superhydrophobic film
prepared for 30 min was estimated to be in the range of 400–800
nm from the cross-sectional SEM image, as shown in Figure SI4. Some sharp and broad peaks are clearly observed.
The sharp peaks are assigned to the Mg alloy substrate, whereas the
broad peaks are attributable to myristic acid, with a monoclinic system;
the peaks are indexed according to ICDD-PDF data (Card No. 00-008-0786).
The several broad peaks at approximately 2θ = 6.6, 8.9, 11.3,
14.4, 18.6, 20.7, 22.1, and 22.9° were assigned to the 002, 003,
004, 005, 012, −113, 110, and −2010 reflections of myristic
acid, with a monoclinic phase. These broad peaks corroborate the presence
of nanosized grains on the surface. However, no peak originated from
crystalline myristic acid could be detected in the XRD pattern of
sample (a) surface prepared using only solution A, indicating that
crystalline myristic acid could not be formed without Ce ions, as
shown in Figure SI5a. This means that Ce
ions or CeO2 would be required to fabricate crystalline
solid myristic acid by the immersion process. Because of the existence
of Ce ions or CeO2, myristic acid might be arranged orderly
and three-dimensionally through the hydrogen bond between carboxyl
groups and/or hydrophobic interaction between methyl groups. However,
at present, the detailed formation mechanism is not clear. Further
studies would be required to elucidate the formation mechanism of
crystalline solid myristic acid. On the other hand, no peak attributable
to CeO2 could be observed in the XRD pattern. According
to our previous study,54 a crystalline
CeO2 film was formed on AZ31 by an immersion process at
room temperature in an aqueous solution containing only Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. Figure SI5b shows the XRD pattern of the film fabricated from an aqueous
solution at pH 2 containing only Ce(NO3)3·6H2O. Five peaks at 2θ ∼28.5, 33.0, 43.6, 56.3,
and 68.4°, assigned to the 111, 200, 220, 311, and 400 reflections
of cubic CeO2, can be clearly observed in the XRD pattern
of Figure SI5b. This indicated that the
crystalline CeO2 film was formed on AZ31 by immersion in
an aqueous solution containing only Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, that is, using only solution B. However, no
crystalline CeO2 film could be fabricated on AZ31 by immersion
in the mixed solution of A and B at room temperature. An amorphous
or very thin CeO2 film might be formed on AZ31. This difference
in the crystallinity of the CeO2 film is possibly due to
the presence of myristic acid in the solution.

treated for 20 min in the mixed solution
at a volume ratio of 0.7.

To reveal the chemical composition of the superhydrophobic
surface
fabricated by the immersion process, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements were conducted. Figure 7a–c shows the C 1s, O 1s, and Ce 3d
XPS spectra of sample (h). The peak in the C 1s spectrum in Figure 7a can be deconvoluted
into three peaks at 282.5, 285.0, and 288.5 eV. The peaks at 285.0
and 288.5 eV are attributed to −CHx and O–C=O, respectively. Although details of the peak
* at 282.5 eV are unknown, this peak might be related to the chemical
bond between C and CeOx. The O 1s spectrum
of sample (h) is deconvoluted into four peaks corresponding to CeO2 at 528.3 eV, C=O at 530.5 eV, O–C=O
at 531.5 eV, and O–C–OH at 532.4 eV. The two Ce 3d peaks
contain nine components originating from the Ce oxidation states (Ce3+ and Ce4+) and their 4f configurations.59 Characters u and v are related to Ce3+ and Ce4+, respectively. Liu et al. reported the possibility
of the formation of cerium myristate (Ce(CH3(CH2)12COO)3) in an aqueous solution containing
Ce ions and myristic acid.60 Thus, the
chemical bonding states of Ce4+ and Ce3+ can
be attributed to the formation of CeO2 and cerium myristate,
respectively.60 The atomic compositions
of C, O, Ce, and Mg obtained from XPS are estimated to be 82.9, 14.6,
1.9, and 0.6 atom %, respectively. These results indicate that the
surface could be composed of myristic acid, cerium myristate, and
CeO2 and the outermost surface is mainly composed of myristic
acid with a low surface energy, which contributes to the fabricated
superhydrophobic surface. The chemical bonding states of the superhydrophobic
surface are further investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
measurements. Figure SI6 shows the FT-IR
spectrum of the superhydrophobic surface. The absorption peaks at
approximately 2851 and 2916 cm–1 are attributed
to C–H asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations in CH2 groups, respectively.61 The weak
peak at approximately 2955 cm–1 is assigned to asymmetric
stretching vibrations in CH3 groups. The broad band in
the range 3400–3000 cm–1 is attributable
to the O–H stretching vibration in −COOH. The two weak
peaks at approximately 1412 and 1659 cm–1 can be
attributed to the O–H bending and C=O stretching modes
of COOH dimers.62 The two peaks at around
1526 and 1445 cm–1 can be assigned to cerium myristate.63 The two peaks at approximately 1109 and 721
cm–1 are attributed to the C–H wagging and
twisting vibrations in the CH2 groups.62 The two weak peaks at around 542 and 881 cm–1 can be assigned to the Ce–O stretching mode.64 The FT-IR spectrum also indicates that the surface could
be composed of myristic acid, cerium myristate, and CeO2.

AZ31 surface.

Surface wettability is
known to be controlled by two factors, i.e.,
the surface energy and surface roughness.65 The water contact angle of a smooth surface can reach a maximum
value of approximately 120° by lowering the surface energy. On
the other hand, on a rough surface with hierarchical structures, the
static water contact angles can reach a maximum value of ∼178°,66 indicating that the fabrication of micro-/nanostructures
is essential for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces.67 The surfaces we fabricated by the immersion
process had many micro-/nanostructures, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. Such surfaces could trap a large fraction of air within the grooves
fabricated between the nanoplates. The trapped air can prevent the
water droplets from penetrating into the grooves of the surfaces.
The superhydrophobic surface fabricated in this study had an advancing
water contact angle of more than 150° and contact angle hysteresis
of less than 10°. These results support the fact that the existence
of the minute spaces created between nanoplates prevents water droplets
from penetrating into the grooves of the surfaces. Therefore, the
micro-/nanostructures composed of CeO2 and myristic acid
can enhance surface hydrophobicity and decrease contact angle hysteresis
by lowering the continuity of the three-phase contact line at the
solid–liquid interface and the contact area between solid and
liquid at their interface. It should be noted that the surface obtained
on our sample after immersion for 30 s showed an advancing water contact
angle over 150°, indicating that our process can impart superhydrophobicity
to the Mg alloy surface in below 1 min.

The formation mechanism
of the superhydrophobic film is as follows.
When the AZ31 Mg alloy was immersed in an acidic solution at pH 2,
Mg dissolved as Mg2+ via the following redox reactions 2   3  Through eq 2, the AZ31
surface could be etched and the surface
roughness could be increased. The formation of OH– could result in an increase in the local solution pH, leading to
a critical value at which Ce(OH)3 could exist steadily,
so that Ce3+ could deposit on the surface through reaction 4 4  The deposited Ce(OH)3 could be
oxidized by H2O2 and/or NO3– because H2O2 and/or NO3– can act as an oxidant. As a result, CeO2 could be formed
through the following electrochemical reactions 5   and/or
6  The formation of CeO2 film on AZ31
could also increase the surface roughness. In addition, CeO2 can act as an effective inhibitor.68 The
increase in the surface roughness due to the formation of a CeO2 film on AZ31 by immersion for less than 60 s in the aqueous
solution containing only Ce(NO3)3 has been reported.54 In addition, crystalline myristic acid was formed
on the AZ31 surface, as shown in Figure 6. The formation of crystalline myristic acid
on the rough CeO2 film fabricated on the AZ31 surface could
further increase the surface roughness, resulting in the formation
of a hierarchical micro-/nanostructured surface. Moreover, the presence
of crystalline myristic acid on the outermost surface could induce
the lowering of the surface energy. These synergic effects could contribute
to the formation of the superhydrophobic surface.

The corrosion
resistance of the superhydrophobic samples (h) fabricated
by the immersion process for 1–30 min was investigated using
potentiodynamic polarization curve measurements. The corrosion potential
(Ecorr) and corrosion current density
(icorr), which are important parameters
for estimating the corrosion resistance, can be obtained from the
polarization curves using Tafel extrapolation. In general, better
corrosion resistance indicates a lower corrosion rate, corresponding
to a lower icorr or a more positive Ecorr.69 Polarization
curves of the superhydrophobic samples (h) fabricated by immersion
for 1–30 min and pristine AZ31 in an aqueous solution of 5
mass % NaCl are shown in Figure 8. The Ecorr value of pristine
AZ31 was −1.49 V versus Ag/AgCl. On the other hand, Ecorr values for the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples
treated for 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min are estimated to be approximately −1.48, −1.19, −1.38,
−1.45, −0.61, and −0.43 V, respectively. Ecorr values of the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples
treated for 1 and 10 min are almost the same as those of pristine
AZ31, whereas the values of the samples treated for 3, 20, and 30
min are more positive than those of pristine AZ31. This indicates
that the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples treated for 3, 20, and 30 min
have a lower corrosion potential than that of pristine AZ31. The icorr of pristine AZ31 was found to be 3.46 ×
10–5 A/cm2. In contrast, the icorr values of the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples
treated for 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min were found to be 1.95 ×
10–5, 1.21 × 10–5, 1.08 ×
10–6, 4.71 × 10–7, and 4.41
× 10–7 A/cm2, respectively. The icorr values of the superhydrophobic AZ31 surfaces
are lower than those of pristine AZ31. The increase in the immersion
time leads to lower icorr values, indicating
improvement of the corrosion resistance. The corrosion inhibition
efficiency, ηp, of the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples
treated for 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min was calculated from polarization
measurements according to the relationship given below  where icorr(untreated AZ31) and icorr(treated AZ31) are the
corrosion current densities for the untreated and treated AZ31, respectively.
The ηp values of the superhydrophobic AZ31 samples
treated for 1, 3, 10, 20, and 30 min were found to be 43.6, 65.0,
96.9, 98.6, and 98.7%, respectively. The icorr and ηp values of the superhydrophobic AZ31 surface
fabricated by immersion for 30 min are the lowest and highest among
those obtained for all samples (h), respectively, indicating that
superhydrophobic AZ31 samples fabricated for 30 min show the best
corrosion resistance among all of the samples tested. In addition,
the superhydrophobic AZ31 sample shows a long passive region on the
anodic branch with no pitting corrosion. The presence of this long
passive region could be due to effective corrosion inhibition characteristics
of CeO2 or the Ce ions.69 Thus,
the protective ability of the superhydrophobic AZ31 surface against
the NaCl aqueous solution is considered to be high. The main reasons
for the improvement of the corrosion resistance are as follows: One
is the presence of CeO2 or Ce ions having effective corrosion
inhibition characteristics in the film and the other is superhydrophobicity
of the film. It has been reported that superhydrophobicity could be
effective in minimizing or reducing the wetted area on a solid surface
because of the presence of many roughness structures, such as grooves,
which could trap air at the solid–liquid interface. The wetted
area on a solid surface could be minimizing or reducing if an air
layer could be present stably in the grooves on the superhydrophobic
surface. Therefore, the corrosion rate of the superhydrophobic film
containing CeO2 or Ce ions would then be much lower than
that of the bare substrate in the corrosive NaCl solution.

by immersion for 1–30 min and bare AZ31 in 5 mass % NaCl aqueous
solution.

To utilize the superhydrophobic
surface in industrial sectors,
it is very useful to clarify the chemical durability of the superhydrophobic
surface against acidic, neutral, or basic aqueous solutions.54 The chemical durability of the superhydrophobic
surface for sample (h) was investigated by measuring the static water
contact angles of the superhydrophobic surfaces before and after immersion
in aqueous solutions at different pH values for predetermined times. Figure 9 shows the relationship
between the static water contact angles of the sample (h1800) surface
and the immersion times in aqueous solutions at pHs 4.0, 7.0, and
10.0. After immersion in the acidic solutions at pH 4.0, the static
water contact angles of the superhydrophobic surfaces gradually decreased
with an increase in the immersion time, indicating that the molecular
density of myristic acid with the hydrophobic functional groups on
the surface could be lowered by immersing the samples in an acidic
solution. The static water contact angles decreased from 150 ±
2° to 113 ± 2° within 80 min after immersion in the
acidic solution. However, the static water contact angles after immersion
for 80–180 min were kept almost constant. Furthermore, when
the immersion time was extended beyond 180 min, the static contact
angles for water lowered to 90 ± 2°, as shown in Figure 9a. In the case of
immersion in the neutral aqueous solution (pH 7.0), the static contact
angles of the superhydrophobic surfaces gradually decreased to 130
± 2° within 80 min. When the immersion time was prolonged
to 720 min, the static contact angle of the superhydrophobic surface
was 119 ± 2°, as shown in Figure 9b. In the case of immersion in the basic
solution at pH 10, the static contact angles of the superhydrophobic
surfaces slightly lowered to 140 ± 2° within 180 min. The
static contact angle was estimated to be 138 ± 2° after
immersion for 720 min, indicating minimal decrease. The averaged static
contact angle values of the superhydrophobic surfaces after immersion
in the aqueous solutions at pHs 4, 7, and 10 for 12 h were found to
be 90 ± 2°, 119 ± 2°, and 138 ± 2°,
respectively. These results indicate that although our superhydrophobic
surface shows high chemical durability in the basic aqueous solution
its chemical durability in the acidic environment is low. This may
be due to dissolution of Ce(CH3(CH2)12COO)3 on the AZ31 sample through pits or defects on the
coating in the acidic environment. The roughness fabricated on the
AZ31 surface may be destroyed as a result of dissolution.

Figure 9 Changes in
static water contact angles of sample surfaces as a
function of immersion time in aqueous solutions at pHs (a) 4.0, (b)
7.0, and (c) 10.0. The superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated by
immersion for 30 min. All of the plots show the averaged values of
water contact angles measured at five different points on the same
samples. The error bars for each plot indicate the maximum and minimum
water contact angles.

Our superhydrophobic surface fabricated by the immersion
process
was exposed to air for 1 year, after which the water contact angles
remained consistent, with values greater than 150°, as shown
in Figure 10a,b, showing
that the superhydrophobic surfaces presented here were highly stable
for a long time. These results imply that our superhydrophobic surfaces
have superior characteristics regarding hydrophobicity and durability. This supports the claim that the
one-step immersion process presented here is a promising strategy
for the cost-effective and rapid fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces
with corrosion resistance.

3 Conclusions
A simple,
easy, and rapid process to impart superhydrophobicity
to the AZ31 Mg alloy surfaces via one-step immersion in a mixed solution
of myristic acid and cerium nitrate was developed. The myristic acid-modified
micro-/nanostructured surface fabricated by the one-step immersion
process was found to have a static contact angle over 150°, resulting
in the formation of superhydrophobic surfaces. The most suitable volume
ratio of myristic acid–ethanol and cerium nitrate aqueous solutions
for fabricating superhydrophobic surfaces was found to be 0.7. When
using the mixed solution, the shortest processing time for the fabrication
of the superhydrophobic surface was 30 s. In addition, XRD patterns
revealed that crystalline solid myristic acid could be formed on a
Mg alloy using the suitable molar ratio of Ce ions and myristic acid.
The formation mechanism of the superhydrophobic surface was discussed.
The contact angle hysteresis decreased with an increase in the immersion
time. The corrosion resistance of the superhydrophobic AZ31 surface
was revealed to be excellent by potentiodynamic polarization curve
measurements. The chemical durability of the superhydrophobic AZ31
surface was also investigated. The average static water contact angles
of the superhydrophobic AZ31 surfaces after immersion in solutions
at pHs 4, 7, and 10 for 12 h were found to be 90 ± 2°, 119
± 2°, and 138 ± 2°, respectively. We believe that
the immersion process presented here would be promising for the large-scale
industrial production of a superhydrophobic Mg alloy having new applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Fabrication of Superhydrophobic
Surfaces
A commercial AZ31 Mg alloy (composition: 2.98 wt
% Al, 0.88 wt
% Zn, 0.38 wt % Mn, 0.0135 wt % Si, 0.001 wt % Cu, 0.002 wt % Ni,
0.0027 wt % Fe, and balance Mg) with dimensions of 10 mm × 10
mm × 1.5 mm was used as the substrates. Each substrate was ultrasonically
cleaned in absolute ethanol for 10 min. Solution A was prepared by
introducing 5.03 g of myristic acid into 100 mL of ethanol. Solution
B was prepared by introducing 1.15 g of cerium nitrate hexahydrate
(Ce(NO3)3·6H2O) into 100 mL
of ultrapure water. Solutions A and B were mixed in volume ratios
of (a) 0:10, (b) 1:9, (c) 2:8, (d) 3:7, (e) 4:6, (f) 5:5, (g) 6:4,
(h) 7:3, (i) 8:2, (j) 9:1, and (k) 10:0. The pH of each mixed solution
was adjusted to 2.0 using nitric acid. The cleaned Mg alloy substrates
were immersed for 10–1800 s in each mixed solution at room
temperature without stirring. After immersion, the AZ31 substrate
was extracted from the mixed solution and then rinsed with ethanol,
followed by drying in inert N2 gas. Hereafter, we refer
to the AZ31 samples obtained by immersing in each mixed solution for
60 and 180 s as sample (a60) and (a180), (b60) and (b180), (c60) and
(c180), (d60) and (d180), (e60) and (e180), (f60) and (f180), (g60)
and (g180), (h60) and (h180), (i60) and (i180), (j60) and (j180),
and (k60) and (k180), respectively.

4.2 Surface
Characterizations
The surface
morphologies of the obtained samples were observed using field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; JSM-7610, JEOL Corp.). The composition
of the samples was quantitatively determined using energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis (FESEM-EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS,
JPS-9010MC). Charge correction for each spectrum was performed using
the standard binding energy of the C 1s peak (284.6 eV) as a reference.70 Crystal phases of the films fabricated on the
surfaces were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku Ultima
IV). The XRD pattern was measured at a scanning rate of 4°/min
and the accelerating voltage of 40 kV in the range of 2θ = 5–80°.
The chemical bonding states of the samples were acquired by FT-IR
(IR Prestige-21, Shimadzu Co.). FT-IR spectra were recorded at a resolution
of 4 cm–1 in ATR mode within the range 400–4000
cm–1 with 256 scans.

Static water contact
angles of the fabricated surfaces were evaluated with a contact angle
meter (DM-501, Kyowa Interface Science) based on a sessile drop measuring
method. The water drop volume for the static contact angle measurements
was 5 μL. The advancing and receding water contact angles of
the fabricated surfaces were measured using ultrapure water that was
added and withdrawn from the drop. The chemical durability of the
superhydrophobic surfaces against aqueous solutions at pHs 4.0, 7.0,
and 10.0 was evaluated by examining the relationship between the changes
in the static water contact angles and the immersion time of the samples
in solutions with different pH levels. All of the water contact angles
were measured at five different points and were averaged. All error
bars for each plot mean the maximum and minimum water contact angles.
All contact angle measurements were carried out at room temperature
in air. The mean roughness (roughness average: Ra) of the fabricated surfaces was estimated using a digital
microscope (KH-1300-S, Hirox Co.). Ra means
the roughness average of a surface composed of microscopic peaks and
valleys and was calculated using the following equation: , where z(x) is
the ordinate of the roughness profile.

All electrochemical measurements
were performed in an aqueous solution
of 5.0 mass % NaCl at room temperature using a computer-controlled
potentiostat (VersaSTAT3, Princeton Applied Research). Potentiodynamic
polarization curves were obtained at a scanning rate of 0.5 mV/s from
−100 to +800 mV with respect to the open-circuit potential
after immersing the treated AZ31 into the NaCl aqueous solution for
30 min. The treated AZ31 and a platinum plate were employed as the
working and counter electrodes, respectively. An Ag/AgCl-saturated
electrode was used as the reference electrode.
