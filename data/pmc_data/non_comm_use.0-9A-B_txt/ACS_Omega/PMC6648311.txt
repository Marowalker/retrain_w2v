Nanometer
triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN) with mean size of 218.7
nm was fabricated, and its structures were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, IR, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analyses. As an energetic accelerator for thermal decomposition
of ammonium perchlorate (AP) and ammonium nitrate (AN), 10% nano TAGN
blended with AP and AN, and samples “[90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)]”
and “[90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)]” were obtained, respectively.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses were employed to
investigate the decomposition kinetics and thermodynamics of the samples.
The results indicated that [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] presented a
higher activation energy (152.34 kJ mol–1) than
pure AP (117.21 kJ mol–1) and [90% AN + 10% (nano
TAGN)] possessed a lower activation energy (147.51 kJ mol–1) than pure AN (161.40 kJ mol–1). All activation
free energies (ΔG≠) were
positive values. This means that activation of the molecules was not
a spontaneous process. The decomposition peak temperature of AP decreased
from 478.5 °C (for pure AP) to 287.2 °C (for [90% AP + 10%
(nano TAGN)]). The decomposition peak of AN also advanced via doping
with nano TAGN. Using DSC-IR analysis, the decomposition products
of nano TAGN, pure AP, [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)], pure AN, and [90%
AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] were investigated, and their decomposition mechanisms
were proposed. The key factors, i.e., the formation of hydrazine in
the decomposition of nano TAGN, were speculated, which substantially
promoted the consumption of HNO3, HClO4, and
their decomposition products in kinetics. Additionally, the energy
performances of AP- and AN-based propellants doping with TAGN were
evaluated. It is disclosed that the introduction of TAGN would not
result in improvement in the energy performance of propellants, but
due to its energetic property and high hydrogen content, proper introduction
of TAGN will not reduce the energy performance of propellants in a
large degree compared with the introduction of inert catalysts.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ammonium perchlorate (AP) is an oxidizer that is extensively used
in composite solid propellants. AP is of almost the highest effective
oxygen content among the oxidizers, i.e., its oxygen balance (OB)
is up to +34%, which results in the oxidization of Al and the binder
in combustion of propellants. Meanwhile, another advantage of AP lies
in its high content of hydrogen. Higher hydrogen content means higher
energy conversion efficiency, i.e., the same heat energy, released
from combustion of propellants, will do more work. Today, with the
emergence of new oxidizers, such as ammonium dinitramide (ADN), the
inferiority of AP is obviously exposed. For example, its formation
enthalpy (−2536 kJ kg–1) is considerably
lower than that of ADN (−1218 kJ kg–1); its
gas production (0.929 m3 kg–1) is somewhat
lower than that of ADN (0.992 m3 kg–1); and its combustion heat (4587 kJ kg–1) is lower
than that of ADN (5145 kJ kg–1); moreover, the kinetic
characteristic of its combustion is much inferior to that of ADN because
of its much higher decomposition temperature (>400 °C) compared
to the decomposition temperature of ADN (∼160 °C). Based
on these data, it seems that it is time to completely replace AP by
ADN or other high-energy oxidizers just like hydrazinium nitroformate
(HNF); however, for most countries, it is unrealistic because they
have not addressed the issue of mass production of ADN and HNF, let
alone some severe defects of ADN and HNF, which have not been solved
yet. Thus, now, AP is still the most ideal oxidizer used in various
propellants. For the most powerful propellant, i.e., nitrate ester
plasticized polyether propellant, there is 7–15% AP in the
formula, which is needed to regulate the burning rate, optimize the
oxygen balance, and lower the combustion pressure exponent. Hence,
now it is too early to give up AP. So, in the past two decades, there
are dozens of works reporting on how to improve the decomposition
property or combustion performance of AP or AP-based propellants.
For metal oxides, nano Fe2O3,1,2 nano
CuO,3,4 nano NiO,5 etc.
were recruited to accelerate thermal decomposition of AP. In addition,
metallic nanoparticles such as nano Fe,6 nano Zn,7 nano Cu,8−10 nano Ni,11,12 etc. were also prepared to promote thermolysis of AP. Besides these,
there were still too many nanomaterials fabricated to give positive
effects on thermolysis of AP and AP-based propellants.13−16

In fact, the most fatal defect of AP is the high chlorine
content
in its molecules (30.2 wt % Cl). Hydrogen chloride is the main combustion
product of AP-based propellants, and it destroys the ozone layer.
Due to this, the alternative oxidizer, which is halogen-free and easily
available, comes to our sight, i.e., ammonium nitrate (AN). Combustion
products of AN-based propellants do not contain hydrogen chloride
and other chlorinated compounds. The AN-based propellants have the
feature of low combustion signature because the combustion does not
produce white smoke or white fog. The second advantage of AN lies
in its super low sensitivity. AN cannot burn at ambient pressure and
also when the pressure is up to 100 MPa.17 Moreover, AN will not explode or decompose under any external impact
and friction action. Hence, AN is a kind of ideal insensitive energetic
material. Notwithstanding, it is unexpected that no propellant formula
uses AN as the main oxidizer and only few gas-generation agent formulas
try to use AN as the main oxidizer.18−20 This is because AN and
AN-based propellants show poor energy and combustion performance.
The heat formation of AN is low to −4600 kJ kg–1, and the value of AP is −2536 kJ kg–1.
Especially, the explosion heat of AN is only 1450 kJ kg–1 and the value of AP is 3720 kJ kg–1. Thus, the
energy performance of AN-based propellants is obviously lower than
that of AP-based propellants. For combustion performance, the burn
rates of AN- and AP-based propellants are about 1 mm s–1 (at 7 MPa) and 10 mm s–1, respectively. Meanwhile,
unlike AP-based propellants, AN-based propellants cannot burn at low
pressure. Some researchers try to improve the combustion performance
of AN-based propellants by adding some catalysts, but with little
success. For example, Naya finds that thermal decomposition of AN
doped with 4 wt % MnO2 does not change compared to pure
AN, and the propellant does not burn when the pressure is less than
1 MPa.21 Moreover, some nanometer materials,
such as nano Al, nano γ-Al2O3, nano CuO,
nano TiO2, nano LiF, etc., also have no obvious effects
on thermal decomposition of AN.22,23 High-nitrogen compounds
like bis-(1H-tetrazolyl) amine ammonium salt (BTA·NH3) are also employed to promote the combustion performance
of AN-based propellants.24 The propellant
doped with BTA·NH3 burns at 1 MPa pressure. This is
a substantial improvement for AN-based propellants. But it is regretful
that the burn rate is still very low, i.e., only 1–2 mm s–1 at 7 MPa. The effect of high-nitrogen compound on
the combustion of AN-based propellant was also studied by Miyata,
and the result is similar to that of BTA·NH3.25 Additionally, it is widely accepted that chloride
compounds have obvious effects on the combustion of AN and AN-based
propellants. In Sinditskii’s work, addition of 7 wt % NaCl
makes AN/glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) propellant burn at 0.5 MPa pressure,
but the burn rate is still less than 1 mm s–1.2626 Therefore, it can
be seen from previous studies that increasing the burning rate of
AN and AN-based propellants is a very difficult task. For this purpose,
the used catalyst must be able to remarkably promote thermal decomposition
of AN in mechanism.

Regardless of the studies of AP or AN, the
reported catalysts are
almost inert materials, which cannot decompose accompanying with the
decomposition of AP or AN. This will result in a penalty on the energy
performance of propellants. In addition, some metallic powders were
also used as catalysts on the decomposition or combustion of propellants.
These metallic particles are different from metal oxides because they
can react with the oxidizer and release some heats. Especially, when
the particle size of metallic particles falls into nanometer scale,
they are fleetly oxidized and act as many active centers due to the
extremely high exothermic rate. The high exothermic rate will greatly
promote the decomposition or combustion of AP and AN. However, despite
this, adding metallic powders into a formula will also obviously deteriorate
the energy performance of propellants. Thus, it is desired to find
a material that can not only quickly release many heats to support
the decomposition of AP or AN but also does not negatively affect
the energy performance of propellants. However, please note that it
does not mean that traditional explosives are capable or competent
of accelerating the decomposition of AP and AN. For example, introduction
of explosives, such as trinitrotoluene, hexogen (hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine,
RDX), octogen (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane, HMX), etc.,
could not affect the decomposition of AP and AN. When they are mixed
with AP or AN, they decompose individually. Hence, we need a catalyst
whose decomposition product must be able to strongly induce thermolysis
of AP and AN at low temperature, so it promotes decomposition of AP
and AN in kinetics. Therefore, it is very necessary to master the
decomposition feature of the catalyst. To achieve this objective,
nanoscale triaminoguanidine nitrate (TAGN) was fabricated, and the
thermal behavior and decomposition mechanism of AP and AN doped with
nano TAGN were investigated here.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Nano
TAGN
Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of nano TAGN are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1a–c shows that the particle
size of nano TAGN is very small. The particles are not spherical and
have a certain aspect ratio. The length-to-diameter ratio is about
2–3. Via measuring the diameter of the particles, the particle
size distributions of nano TAGN are given in Figure 1e,f. The frequency distribution shows obvious
normal distribution. Volume distribution is obtained by integrating
the curve of frequency distribution. Then, the median diameter of
nano TAGN, i.e., d50 = 218.7 nm, is obtained.

Figure 1 SEM images
(a–d) and size distribution (e, f) of nano TAGN.

The crystal phases of TAGN before and after milling
were analyzed
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and the XRD patterns are shown
in Figure 2a. It is
obvious that nano TAGN has almost the same diffraction peaks as raw
TAGN. The peak intensity of raw TAGN is 70 times higher than that
of nano TAGN, which attributes to the nanometer size of nano TAGN.
IR spectra are illustrated in Figure 2b. The IR spectrum of nano TAGN is consistent with
that of the raw TAGN. Specifically, peaks at 3317 and 3214 cm–1 relate to the stretching vibration of the N–H
bond; the peak at 1680 cm–1 corresponds to the stretching
vibration of C=N bond; the peak at 1607 cm–1 corresponds to the in-plane bending vibration of N–H bond;
the peak at 1381 cm–1 refers to the stretching vibration
of N–O bond in NO3–; the peak
at 1126 cm–1 attributes to the in-plane swaying
vibration of NH2; the peak at 950 cm–1 ascribes to the out-plane bending vibration of N–H bond;
the peak at 828 cm–1 corresponds to the deformation
vibration of N–O bond in NO3–;
and the peak at 602 cm–1 relates to the out-plane
swaying vibration of NH2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) images of nano TAGN are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3a indicates that only three elements O, N, and C are
detected, which is consistent with the elements in the molecule of
nano TAGN. Figure 3b indicates that N 1s splits into two peaks. One relates to the N
atom in NO3–; another corresponds to
N atom in N–H.

2.2 Thermolysis
of AP Doped with Nano TAGN
To probe the catalysis effect
of TAGN on thermolysis of AP, 0.9 g
AP is homogeneously mixed with 0.1 g of nano TAGN, and the sample
named “[90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)]” is obtained. Thermal
analyses are carried out for both pure AP and [90% AP + 10% (nano
TAGN)] at different heating rates, and the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) traces are illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4a shows the DSC traces of pure AP. In each curve, an endothermic
peak appears at 244 °C relating to phase transformation of AP.
The exothermic peaks located at 431–479 °C relate to thermolysis
of AP. Please note that no low-temperature decomposition peak exists
in the curve. Usually, there are two exothermic peaks in the DSC curve
of AP: one corresponds to its low-temperature decomposition; another
ascribes to its high-temperature decomposition. Herein, because the
samples did not perform a tablet pressing before testing, there was
only one exothermic peak in the curve. However, due to the same test
condition for all samples, the experimental results are comparable
and persuasive. Figure 4b shows the DSC curve of [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)]. A small exothermic
peak appears at 190–208 °C, which should relate to thermal
decomposition of nano TAGN. At elevated temperature, an endothermic
peak appears relating to phase transformation of AP. The main exothermic
peak, which attributes to the decomposition of AP, locates at 267–287
°C. By comparing Figure 4a with Figure 4b, it is obvious that decomposition temperature of AP decreases remarkably
when 10% nano TAGN are doped. In fact, in most of the references that
reported the catalysts (or accelerator) for thermal decomposition
of AP, it is very rare that the decomposition temperature of AP can
be reduced to less than 300 °C. As an exceptional case, an active
catalyst was reported by Guo, in which an energetic ionic salt K2Pb[Co(NO2)6] was prepared and employed
to promote thermal decomposition of AP.27 Therein, the decomposition temperature of AP decreased to 295.9
°C when K2Pb[Co(NO2)6] was doped.
K2Pb[Co(NO2)6] decomposed first at
272.8 °C, and its decomposition products induced thermolysis
of AP.

and (d) kinetic compensation effect.

For a further investigation in catalysis effect of nano TAGN
on
thermolysis of AP, the thermodynamic kinetic parameters are calculated
with eqs 1–5,28 and the results are
listed in Table 1. EK of pure AP is 117.2 kJ mol–1 and EK of [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)]
is 152.34 kJ mol–1. This is an abnormal result because
decomposition of [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] should be easier to initiate
than the decomposition of pure AP. Thus, I do not think these data
are correct. But the date of rate constant (k) is
representative. The k value of [90% AP + 10% (nano
TAGN)] is 20 times larger than the value of pure AP. This means that
nano TAGN considerably promoted thermal decomposition of AP. AP will
not decompose spontaneously. Its initiation needs some heats (i.e.,
ΔH≠). According to the ΔH≠ values in Table 1, [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] needs more heats
to be activated. As similar as the case of EK, this result also fails to elucidate the acceleration effect
of nano TAGN on the decomposition of AP, in comparison with the substantial
advance of decomposition peak showed in DSC traces. All ΔG≠ are positive values, which confirms
that the decomposition of AP will not be initiated spontaneously.
The values of activation entropy (ΔS≠) are calculated using eq 5. We could find that all ΔS≠ are positive values. This makes the −TΔS≠ term in eq 5 a negative value. Meanwhile, a positive value
for ΔS≠ corresponds to an
increase in the randomness or disorder of the system when the activation
of the molecules occurs 1   2   3   4   5  where Tp is the
peak temperature, K; KB and h are the Boltzmann (KB = 1.381 ×
10–23 J K–1) and Plank constants
(h = 6.626 × 10–34 J s–1), respectively; β is the heating rate; EK and AK are the
activation energy and preexponential factor, respectively; ΔH≠ is the activation enthalpy, J mol–1; ΔG≠ is
the activation free energy, J mol–1; and ΔS≠ is the activation entropy, J mol–1 K–1.

To probe the decomposition mechanism
of AP doped with nano TAGN,
DSC-IR analyses were conducted, and results are shown in Figure 5. In Guo’s
work, he had confirmed that decomposition products of K2Pb[Co(NO2)6] react with decomposition products
of AP, which resulted in a substantial promotion in thermal decomposition
of AP.27 Thus, herein, we first study the
decomposition mechanism of nano TAGN. Figure 5a,b illustrates the DSC trace of nano TAGN,
synchronously displaying the curve of total absorbance of gas products.
At different temperatures (or time lapses), the IR spectra are extracted
and illustrated in Figure 5c. The main products for thermal decomposition of nano TAGN
are NH3, N2O, and CO2; few C–N–H
and N–H fragments are also detected. We know that there is
no NH4+ cation existing in TAGN molecules. Hence,
the formation of NH3 would not ascribe to the movement
of proton from NH4+ cation to anion just like
the dissociation of AP or AN. Via carefully observing Figure 5c, we find that the appearances
of NH3, C–N–H, and N–H do not coincide
with the appearances of N2O and CO2. Well, I
mean NH3, C–N–H, and N–H fragments
form first, corresponding to the low-temperature decomposition in Figure 5b; the N2O and CO2 produce at elevated temperature, relating to
the high-temperature decomposition in Figure 5b. This result agrees with Kubota’s
work.29 Therein, he also found that there
are two exothermic stages in the thermal decomposition of TAGN: one
stage corresponds to splitting of •NH2 radicals from TAGN molecules, which is a very quick process accompanying
with 27% weight loss (accessing to the theoretical value of 30%);
another stage relates to the decomposition of the remainder. I consider
that Kubota’s proposal is correct; otherwise, we cannot explain
where the massive NH3 comes from. Two •NH2 radicals combine with hydrazine (H2N–NH2). The hydrazine is oxidized by HNO3 to generate
N2 and few N2O. Meanwhile, many H2N–NH2 also decompose to NH3, and the
NH3 is oxidized by HNO3 at elevated temperature
to form substantial N2O. Thus, the decomposition mechanism
of nano TAGN is suggested as eqs 6–12. In Figure 5c, it is obvious that, at a time lapse of
1416.3 s (233.1 °C in Figure 5b), there are no CO2 and N2O
formed, i.e., the first exothermic stage is independent of eqs 7–12. The split of •NH2 radicals
from TAGN (i.e., eq 6) molecules solely accounts for the first exothermic stage. Now,
based on the decomposition mechanism of nano TAGN, let us come into
subject to discuss the decomposition of AP doped with nano TAGN 6   7   8   9   10   11   12  Figure 5e,f shows the DSC trace of pure AP, synchronously illustrating
the curve of total absorbance of gas products. In the DSC trace, it
is clear that there are two exothermic processes. At 303–330
°C, the exothermic process is very broad, which relates to low-temperature
decomposition of AP; at 378–421 °C, the main exothermic
peak appears, which attributes to high-temperature decomposition of
AP. In Figure 5e, it
is clear that both processes have gaseous products formed. We extract
the IR spectra of these gaseous products and illustrate them in Figure 5g. The main decomposition
products of pure AP are N2O, NO2, HCl, H2O, and NOCl, and few NO and HClO4 were also detected.
The signal of CO2 in Figure 5g results from an unexpected introduction of organics
contamination in DSC analysis, but this does not affect the experimental
results. Please note that no NH3 gas was detected in low-
or high-temperature decomposition of pure AP. This result is in accordance
with the common decomposition mechanism of AP;30 i.e., NH4ClO4 first dissociates to
NH3 and HClO4 by a proton transfer, and HClO4 rapidly decomposed to • ClO2 and •HO2 radicals; then, the NH3 is quickly oxidized by HClO4, •ClO2, and •HO2 to produce
N2O, HCl, H2O, NOCl, etc. In the decomposition
of AP, the rate-limiting step is not the decomposition of HClO4 but rather the consumption of the decomposition products
of HClO4.31 At low temperature,
NH3 reacts with decomposition products of HClO4 slowly. The excessive ammonia coated on the surface of AP particles
results in the cease of the decomposition. However, at low temperature
(303–330 °C), we still did not find any signal of NH3. There are two possibilities accounted for this phenomenon:
(i) much ammonia is adsorptively captured by particle surface of AP
and (ii) oxidation of ammonia is very easy to occur at low temperature,
which results in complete oxidation of ammonia. Just like most authors,
I prefer the first speculation because the redox reaction between
NH3 and the oxidizing gases continues at elevated temperature.31 I suggest that just because the reaction rate
and the heat release are too low to sustain the redox reaction at
low temperature, the decomposition of AP ceases. Therefore, an acceleration
of HClO4 consumption and its decomposition products at
low temperature is very important because a violent redox reaction
will produce more heats to break the “NH3 prison”.
Obviously, it is hard to change the decomposition and the products
of perchloric acid. However, we can introduce some materials whose
decomposition products can be more easily oxidized than NH3 by the oxidizing gases at low temperature. Decomposition of nano
TAGN makes the idea satisfied. Figure 5a–d indicates that nano TAGN decomposes earlier
than AP to produce many •NH2 radicals
and •NH–C– (or •N–C−) fragments. These amine radicals would combine
to produce hydrazine, which would instantaneously react with perchloric
acid and its decomposition products at low temperature to produce
many heats (see Figure 5h,i). The sample [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] decomposed at very low
temperature, which is consistent with the result of DSC analysis in Figure 4b. Figure 5j,k indicates that in the temperature
range of 200–209 °C, only a less amount of NH3 gas is generated, which is derived from the decomposition of hydrazine
as the intermediate. In Figure 5j, we can find that the main decomposition products of [90%
AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] are very different from those of pure AP. At
a temperature of 284–304 °C, the main products are just
N2O and HCl, and very little CO2 is detected.
The intermediate products (such as NO2, NOCl, and HClO4), which are produced by the decomposition of pure AP, do
not appear in the decomposition of [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)]. These
oxidizing gases have reacted with hydrazine, amine radicals, and NH3 with considerable heat release at low temperature, which
strongly induces the decomposition of AP.

2.3 Thermolysis
of AN Doped with Nano TAGN
The catalysis effects of nano
TAGN on thermal decomposition of AN
are also investigated here. AN (0.9 g) is homogeneously mixed with
0.1 g of nano TAGN, and the sample is named “[90% AN + 10%
(nano TAGN)]”. DSC analyses are performed, and the results
are shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a, each
DSC curve contains four small endothermic peaks and a large endothermic
peak. The peaks located at 48.8, 85.8, and 128.9 °C correspond
to the phase transformation of AN. The peak located at 169 °C
represents the melting point of AN. The large peak at elevated temperature
relates to thermal decomposition of AN. In the case of [90% AN + 10%
(nano TAGN)] (in Figure 6b), the phase transitions, which are located at 58.6 and 129.2 °C,
still exist; phase transition at 85.8 °C disappeared; the melting
point advanced to 155.3 °C compared to 169 °C of pure AN;
and the peak temperature of decomposition also advanced about 5 °C
compared to pure AN. Meanwhile, the DSC analyses of raw and nano TAGN
are also performed, and the results are shown in Figure 6c,d. The decomposition process
of nano TAGN is similar to the process of raw TAGN. Regardless of
whether raw or nano TAGN, there are two or three exothermic peaks
in the DSC curves. This is consistent with the result in Figure 5a. Thermal decomposition
of TAGN releases many heats. This may not be important in the case
of AP because decomposition of perchloric acid is easier and more
exothermic. The reaction kinetics of chlorine oxides (from HClO4) and ammonia is superior to the reaction kinetics of nitrogen
oxides (from HNO3) and ammonia.17 Hence, in the case of AN, the excess heats from the decomposition
of nano TAGN are very important because the initiation of the decomposition
of AN is substantially endothermic.

(e) kinetic plots; and
(f) kinetic compensation effect.

In fact, in Sinditskii’s work, he considered that
there
were two major factors that determined whether the catalyst particles
could become active centers in the combustion of propellants.32 First, the best situation is the catalyst can
decompose and release many heats to support the condense-phase decomposition
of the propellant; second, the decomposition rate of the catalyst
must be significantly higher than the decomposition rate of propellants.
Just like ammonium dichromate, it easily decomposes at low temperature
and quickly releases many heats. Thus, the AN-based propellant doped
with 8 wt % ammonium dichromate burns sustainedly at 0.5 MPa.33 The exothermic decomposition of nano TAGN is
confirmed in Figure 6c,d. In addition to this, the maximum heat flow (Qmax) of nano TAGN is also obviously larger than the Qmax of pure AN. The value of heat flow characterizes
the rate of heat release of the measured sample in DSC analysis. Moreover,
in Table 2, the kinetic
calculation indicates that the activation energy (EK) for thermal decomposition of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)]
is lower than the EK of pure AN, and the
rate constant (k) of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] is
somewhat higher than k of pure AN. This means that
[90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] decomposed easier and faster than pure
AN. However, in Table 2, please note that the EK for nano TAGN
almost equals EK for pure AN. But the k-values for nano and raw TAGN are higher than those of
pure AN. These results reluctantly confirm the superiority of the
decomposition of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] beyond the decomposition
of pure AN in kinetics. Figure 6f shows the plot of ln AK vs EK, i.e., the kinetic compensation
effect. Except the point of pure AN, other points present good linear
relationships. This implies that the decompositions of raw TAGN, nano
TAGN, and [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] have similar kinetic mechanisms.
At least, in mathematics, thermolysis of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)]
is similar to that of TAGN. Although kinetic mechanism cannot be equated
with chemical mechanism, we could also conclude that there is a great
similarity between thermolysis of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] and TAGN.
To disclose the relationship, DSC-IR analyses are conducted, and the
results are shown in Figure 7. Other thermodynamic parameters, such as ΔH≠, ΔG≠, and ΔS≠, show the same
meaning and change rules as the parameter in Table 1, and I will not repeat it here.

In Figure 7a–c,
the spectra indicate that a large amount of gas evolves in the temperature
range of 238.7–322.1 °C, attributing to thermal decomposition
of pure AN. The main decomposition products are N2O, HNO3, and H2O. According to the radical mechanism for
thermal decomposition of AN (eqs 13–15), ammonium nitrate
first dissociates to NH3 and HNO3 with 2.18
kJ g–1 heat absorption; at elevated temperature,
HNO3 decomposes to •OH and NO2 with a molecular homolysis; •OH reacts with NH3 to produce •NH2 and H2O, and •NH2 is oxidized by NO2 to form N2O and H2O. In Figure 7c, there is no signal of NH3,
which means that all NH3 is oxidized by decomposition products
of nitric acid. This also implies that NH3 reacts with
decomposition products of HNO3 instantaneously, which is
not the rate-limiting step. The controlling step for thermolysis of
AN is the homolysis of nitric acid.34 Because
of the positive oxygen balance of AN (+20%), the remaining nitric
acid does not decompose and is detected as a product of thermolysis
of pure AN. 13   14   15   16  Decomposition
of [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)]
is very different from the decomposition of pure AN. Its main products
are N2O, CO2, and H2O, and few NH3 are detected. Please note that as mentioned above, herein,
the key factor is the formation of NH3. These NH3 are derived from the decomposition of TAGN rather than from the
decomposition of AN because no NH3 is detected in the decomposition
of pure AN. Just like eqs 6–9, •NH2 radicals splitting from TAGN combine with H2N–NH2. Hydrazine has quite high reactivity as a fuel. In fact,
hydrazine ignites instantaneously when it comes in contact with an
oxidizer like nitric acid.35 Thus, in Figure 7f, no HNO3 is detected, and all HNO3 directly reacts with hydrazine
and ammonia, i.e., HNO3 can be consumed directly without
having to be decomposed. This changes the rate-limiting step of the
decomposition of AN. The remaining hydrazine decomposes to NH3, N2, and H2 as eq 9. N2 and H2 are nonpolar
molecules, which cannot be detected by infrared spectrometer, but
NH3 is detected. This is the proposed mechanism of how
thermolysis of TAGN affects thermolysis of AN.

2.4 Energy
Performance
In this work,
to clearly study the catalysis mechanism of nano TAGN more clearly,
the introduction of nano TAGN is up to 10 wt %. Thus, the evaluation
of energy performance is very important. Herein, using AP or AN as
the oxidizer and glycidyl azide polymer (GAP) as the binder, we calculate
the energy performance of propellants doped with different catalysts,
and the results are listed in Table 3; meanwhile, the combustion products and their molar
ratio for some propellants are also calculated, and the results are
shown in Figure 8.
For formula of AP0.8/GAP0.2, its standard specific
impulse (Isp) is 2438.3 N s kg–1. When 10% AP is replaced by TAGN, the Isp value increases to 2498.0 N s kg–1. This is not
because TAGN is a high-energy material, but rather due to the change
of the oxygen balance from positive value to negative value. Figure 8a discloses that
AP0.8/GAP0.2 is a formula with positive oxygen
balance because 2.7 mol % O2 exists in its combustion products.
The propellants with positive oxygen balance and zero oxygen balance
usually are of low energy performance.36 Other than AP0.8/GAP0.2, the combustion of
AP0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 produces some
CO and H2, which confirms that it is a negative oxygen
balance formula. The oxygen balance, formation heat, and explosion
heat of TAGN are −33.4% (OBCO2), −280.6,
and 3472 kJ kg–1, respectively. Thus, it is not
counted as a high-energy material just like hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
(RDX) and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane (HMX). Formulas of
AP0.7/RDX0.1/GAP0.2 and AP0.7/HMX0.1/GAP0.2 show somewhat higher energy
performance than AP0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2. But TAGN should not be devoid of any merit for energy performance.
The contribution of TAGN to energy performance results from its higher
hydrogen content (5.4 wt % of TAGN to 3.4 wt % of AP). Increasing
hydrogen content is very effective for enhancing the specific impulse
of propellants due to the increase of energy conversion efficiency
in combustion process of propellants. The higher energy conversion
efficiency means that the same heat energy, released from combustion
of propellants, does more works. Roughly, an increase of 1.0 wt %
hydrogen is equivalent to an increase of 2000 kJ kg–1 formation enthalpy when the oxygen balance is similar. However,
increase of hydrogen content also means decrease of combustion heat
of propellants. Hence, despite lower hydrogen content (2.7 wt % of
RDX and 2.7 wt % of HMX), RDX and HMX have a greater contribution
to energy performance when the oxygen balance is similar because they
are of very high explosion heats. Additionally, introduction of catalysts
such as Fe2O3, CuO, NiO, Fe, Cu, and Ni, which
could promote the decomposition or combustion performance of AP or
AP-based propellants, results in a remarkable penalty on the energy
performance of propellants.

a The superscripts
(0.1, 0.2, 0.7,
and 0.8) in propellant formulas represent the mass fraction of the
corresponding ingredients. Isp is the
standard specific impulse; C* is the characteristic
speed; Tc is the combustion chamber temperature; Mc is the average molecular weight of combustion
products; and Qp is the explosion heat.
All of the parameters for energy performances were calculated by means
of software ProPep 3.0 at a condition of Pc/Pe = 70:1 and T0 = 298 K, in which Pc is the pressure
of combustion chamber (Pc = 7 MPa), Pe is the pressure of the nozzle (Pe = 0.1 MPa), and T0 is the
initial temperature of propellants.

The case of AN-based propellants shows a similar situation
to AP-based
propellants. First, note that other than AP-based propellants, the
formula AN0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 is of
lower energy performance than AN0.8/GAP0.2.
Because the oxygen balance of AN (+20%) is lower than the OB of AP
(+34%), AN0.8/GAP0.2 is a negative oxygen balance
formula in comparison with the positive oxygen balance formula AP0.8/GAP0.2. The chemical energy and the energy conversion
efficiency reach a balance, at which the propellant shows high combustion
temperature (Tc) and low average molecular
weight of products (Mc). When replacing
10 wt % AN with TAGN, oxygen balance is more negative, which does
not benefit from the release of chemical energy. Meanwhile, due to
the low explosion heat of TAGN (3472 kJ kg–1), the Tc and Qp of AN0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 are obviously lower
than those of AN0.8/GAP0.2. However, because
the hydrogen content of TAGN (5.4 wt %) is slightly higher than that
of AN (5.0 wt %), Mc of AN0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 is lower than that of AN0.8/GAP0.2. Figure 8c,d illustrates that the combustion of AN0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 produces more H2, CO, and N2 and less CO2 and H2O, which is beneficial to the increase of energy conversion efficiency
of propellants. But the improvement of energy conversion efficiency
still cannot offset the reduction of chemical energy. Thus, Isp of AN0.7/TAGN0.1/GAP0.2 is still lower than Isp of
AN0.8/GAP0.2. For formulas of AN0.7/RDX0.1/GAP0.2 and AN0.7/HMX0.1/GAP0.2, despite the lower hydrogen content,
they have higher specific impulse because of their very higher explosion
heat of RDX (6192 kJ kg–1) and HMX (6317 kJ kg–1). Hence, it almost concludes that the introduction
of TAGN would not render some improvement to the energy performance
of propellants, but due to its energetic property and high hydrogen
content, proper introduction of TAGN will not reduce the energy performance
of propellants too much. Moreover, similarly to AP-based propellants,
doping with inertia catalysts such as Fe2O3,
CuO, NiO, Fe, Cu, and Ni greatly reduces the energy performance of
AN-based propellants.

3 Conclusions
Herein,
as an accelerator for thermal decomposition of AP and AN,
nano TAGN with high reactivity and energetic property was fabricated
by mechanical milling method. Samples [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)] and
[90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] were prepared via doping nano TAGN with
AP and AN, respectively. The decomposition temperatures of [90% AP
+ 10% (nano TAGN)] and [90% AN + 10% (nano TAGN)] advance obviously
compared to pure AP and AN, i.e., nano TAGN promoted thermolysis of
AP and AN.

Another investigation lies in the disclosing of decomposition
mechanisms
of nano TAGN, pure AP, [90% AP + 10% (nano TAGN)], pure AN, and [90%
AN + 10% (nano TAGN)]. It is found that there are many NH3 formed in the decomposition of nano TAGN. TAGN does not contain
the group such as NH4+, which could dissociate
to NH3 at decomposition temperature. Thus, we suggested
that radicals •NH2 splitting from TAGN
molecules combine with each other to form hydrazine (H2N–NH2). Hydrazine was oxidized by HNO3 and HClO4 spontaneously and quickly. The process releases
many heats and accelerates thermolysis of AP and AN in kinetics. Meanwhile,
some hydrazine decomposed to NH3, N2, and H2 at high temperature simultaneously, which was detected by
an infrared spectrometer. This is the key mechanism of how nano TAGN
promotes thermolysis of AP and AN, and the speculation was also confirmed
by the IR spectra for other decomposition products of samples.

Third, using AP or AN as the oxidizer, GAP as the binder, and TAGN
as the catalyst, the energy performances of the propellants were calculated.
It almost concludes that the introduction of TAGN would not render
some improvement to the energy performance of propellants, but due
to its energetic property and high hydrogen content, proper introduction
of TAGN will not reduce the energy performance of propellants too
much. Moreover, the combustion temperature of the propellants doped
with TAGN is much lower. Therefore, nano TAGN is expected to be used
as a coolant in propellants, which should not only improve combustion
performance but also ensure a relatively high energy performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Ammonium
perchlorate (AP),
ammonium nitrate (AN), ethanol (EtOH), and hydrazine hydrate (80%)
are bought from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co., Ltd. Guanidine nitrate
is bought from Zibo Nano Industry and Trade Co. Ltd., China (http://www.xiaosuangua.com/).

4.2 Fabrication of Nano TAGN
Materials
of 60 g of guanidine nitrate, 50 g of AN, 125 mL of hydrazine hydrate,
and some deionized water are added into a 200 mL round-bottom flask.
The flask is heated to 90–100 °C, and the temperature
is maintained for 15 min. A lot of bubbles (ammonia gas) generated
at this time. When there are no bubbles generating, heating is stopped,
and the reaction is complete. After the temperature of the flask decreases
to ambient temperature, the flask is put into an ice–water
bath (0–5 °C). Gradually, a lot of white crystals precipitate
out. After filtrating, washing (by EtOH), and freeze drying, raw TAGN
is obtained. The raw TAGN is pulverized to nano TAGN upon a high-energy
ball mill (YXQM-1L) manufactured by Changsha MITR Instrument and Equipment
Corporation, China.

4.3 Characterization
Surface morphology
of nano TAGN particles is investigated with a scanning electron microscope
(JEOL JSM-7500). Crystal phase of nano TAGN is studied using an X-ray
diffractometer (Bruker Advance D8). The molecular structure of nano
TAGN is probed with an infrared spectrometer (Nicolet 6700). Surface
elements of nano TAGN are studied with an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope
(ULVAC-PHI). DSC analysis (TA Q600) is employed to investigate thermal
decomposition of samples. DSC-IR analysis (Mettle Toledo) is recruited
to investigate the decomposition products of samples.
