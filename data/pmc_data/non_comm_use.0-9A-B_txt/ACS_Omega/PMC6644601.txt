We report a theoretical study on
the impact of native defects present
in CuVO3 material on its conductivity using first-principles
calculations based on density functional theory. We find a low and
direct band gap of 1.4 eV for the pristine cell together with relatively
high solar absorption efficiency, high macroscopic dielectric constant,
and delocalized orbital characters of photogenerated charge carriers.
This result highlights CuVO3 as a good candidate for photovoltaic
application. Among the various explored native defects (including
vacancies, interstitials, and antisites), we demonstrate that only
those associated with O vacancies are shallow donors and with Cu vacancies
are shallow acceptors, leading respectively to n-type and p-type conductivities
under O-poor and O-rich growing conditions.

Introduction
Designing new potential absorber semiconducting
materials used
in photovoltaic solar cells requires the appropriate determination
of different components that will be assembled in the final device.
In addition to the required low band gap in the 1.1–1.5 eV
range to reach the maximum solar energy efficiency,1 other specific intrinsic parameters directly involved in
the processes must be properly tuned. They include the solar light
absorption intensity, exciton binding energy, and possibility of charge
carrier diffusion throughout the crystal structure to the surface.

Experimentally, previous works on semiconductors widely used in
photovoltaic devices revealed that a higher dielectric constant value
than 10 is enough to obtain a good ability for exciton dissociation
into free holes and electrons at room temperature.2−7 Moreover, they have also shown that the delocalization orbital character
of photogenerated charge carriers is required to give low effective
masses and help for their good transport to the surface by minimizing
the electron–hole pairs recombination.2,8,9

To design and characterize new materials
for solar energy conversion
applications, the density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a
valuable computational tool to quantify these key intrinsic parameters
because of the difficulties to their direct experimental measurement.
Achieving accurate DFT computations is thus particularly relevant,
and this is known to be in strong relationship with the type of the
exchange–correlation functional used for describing the various
electron–electron interactions.

Previous theoretical
studies10−20 on largely utilized semiconducting materials in photocatalytic water
splitting and photovoltaics showed that the intrinsic parameters mentioned
above can be predicted with good accuracy using DFT along with the
screened Coulomb hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)
functional. Following this robust computational protocol, we have
recently investigated the electronic, optical, dielectric, and transport
properties of the monoclinic vanadium(V) oxynitride, VON (namely,
γ-phase) and the orthorhombic mixed tin(II) and tungsten(VI)
oxide, pristine SnWO4 (namely, α-phase), semiconductor
crystals and predicted suitable behaviors for photovoltaic applications.16,18 A few years earlier, we have also predicted a suitable band gap
of the mixed copper(I) and vanadium(V) oxide material, pristine CuVO3, within the hexagonal crystal structure for photovoltaics.13

Last, we mainly focused on deeply understanding
the essential fundamental
properties of CuVO3 for solar energy conversion applications
for the main reason summarized in Figure 1. By comparing the absorption intensity of
pristine CuVO3 with those acquired for VON and pristine
SnWO4 crystals, we show that the solar light absorption
efficiency of CuVO3 is the highest one in the zone covering
the whole region of visible light. This result highlights this material
as a very good absorber of solar energy.2,6,9,13,16,18 Nevertheless, relevant information
about the possibility for exciton separation to free electrons–holes
and mobility of charge carriers using the pristine CuVO3 needed to be clarified. Although CuVO3 is a ternary compound
and should experience lesser intrinsic defects than CZT(S,Se),21 at least Cu and O vacancies as well as cationic
antisites are required to be taken into consideration to fully characterize
the optoelectronic properties of this compound. These fundamental
aspects will be provided in detail in the present work.

VON (b), and SnWO4 (c) crystals, as obtained
using DFT/HSE06 calculations.

In this paper, we present a systematic first-principles computational
study on native defects in CuVO3 using DFT to understand
how they can impact the conductivity of this material in direct correlation
with its potential for solar energy conversion. Besides the electronic
structure and the visible-light absorption coefficient spectrum of
the pristine cell, we computed the imaginary and real parts of photon
energy-dependent dielectric function along the three main light polarization
vectors in its crystal lattice, the electronic (including local field
effects) and ionic contributions to its macroscopic static dielectric
tensor, and the hybridization characters of its band edges in terms
of partial charge density maps to give an overall picture on its optoelectronic
properties. Then, we calculated the transition and formation energies
of the various explored native defects (including vacancies, interstitials,
and antisites) with different charge states together with Fermi level
pinning positions. Among all of them, we found that only those corresponding
to Cu vacancies are shallow acceptors and those corresponding to O
vacancies are shallow donors, leading, respectively, to p-type and
n-type conductivities under O-rich and O-poor/Cu-rich growing conditions.

Results
and Discussion
Optoelectronic Properties of Pristine CuVO3
The crystal lattice of CuVO3 is hexagonal
(space group
is rhombohedral R3) with an ordered ilmenite structure
made by layers of Cu+ ions in octahedral O2– environment. The CuO6 octahedra are shared by edges with
Cu–O bonds in between 2.02 and 2.22 Å and interconnected
by corners and edges with other layers of V5+ ions in octahedral
O2– environment, VO6, characterized by
V–O bonds going from 1.80 to 2.06 Å (see Figure 2). The calculated lattice constants
(a = b = 4.93 Å and c = 13.98 Å, α = β = 90° and γ
= 120°) well reproduced the measured ones (a = b = 4.96 Å and c = 14 Å,
α = β = 90° and γ = 120°).22

Figure 2 DFT-optimized crystal structure (based on 2 × 2 ×
1 supercell)
of pristine CuVO3. Cu are shown in blue, V in green, and
O in red.

Figure 3a displays
the computed total and partial electronic density of states of pristine
CuVO3 using HSE06 functional. The electronic structure
analysis indicates a relatively small band gap of 1.4 eV, which mainly
comes from electronic excitations involving filled Cu 3d10 orbitals and unoccupied V 3d0 orbitals. The obtained
band gap for this material is found to be either indirect from Γ
to M point in the first Brillouin zone or direct
at Γ point, as shown in Figure 3b. Interestingly, our predicted band gap of 1.4 eV
for CuVO3 is in line with the main required property for
developing new and suitable semiconductors for photovoltaic devices.
Note that our computed band structure using Perdew–Burke–Emzerhof
(PBE) is in good agreement with that previously reported13 using HSE06 with only minor discrepancy. Apart
from the difference in the functional, the use of more reliable model
(2 × 2 × 1 supercell) together with an expanded cutoff energy
(up to 600 eV) for electron wave functions as adopted here is expected
to give more reliable data.

of states (based
on HSE06 functional) and (b) electronic band structure (based on PBE
functional) of pristine CuVO3.

We have then studied the absorption features in pristine
CuVO3 crystal structure from the computed imaginary part
of complex
dielectric function in the three main incident light polarization
vectors versus energy of photon using HSE06 functional. A relatively
small optical anisotropy is obtained from the weak dependence on the
polarization vector (see Figure 4a). If light is polarized along either ⟨100⟩
or ⟨010⟩ direction of the hexagonal lattice, the absorption
edge occurs at 1.4 eV, which gives the band gap of this compound.
For a polarization of light in the ⟨001⟩ direction,
the onset of absorption becomes slightly higher in energy.

imaginary part and (b) real part of photon energy-dependent
dielectric function in the three main ⟨100⟩, ⟨010⟩,
and ⟨001⟩ light polarization vectors (based on HSE06
functional) of pristine CuVO3.

By computing the real-part of the photon energy-dependent
complex
dielectric function along the three principal light polarization vectors
of pristine CuVO3 crystal structure using HSE06 functional,
we have examined the dielectric behavior inside the crystal lattice
of this material. Figure 4b highlights (in black dots) the optical part of the dielectric
tensor for this material, which was deduced from each plot at the
corresponding electronic band gap energy. The dielectric analysis
shows a kind of anisotropic nature related to the direction of light
polarization, in particular around the electronic band gap energy
zone of this material. A dielectric constant of 10 is obtained for
a light polarization along either the ⟨100⟩ or ⟨010⟩
direction of the crystal lattice, while a higher value of 21 is found
when the light is polarized along the ⟨001⟩ direction.

We have also calculated the electronic part of dielectric tensors
of pristine CuVO3 crystal using another approach based
on the self-consistent response upon the application of an external
static electric field together with HSE06 functional. In principle,
this method is supposed to be more accurate, as it takes into account
the induced local field effects. The ionic contribution to the dielectric
tensor of each material is calculated using the linear response approach
through density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) with PBE functional. Table 1 reports the computed
nonzero values of optical, vibrational, and total dielectric constant
tensors of this material along the three principal directions. We
obtained macroscopic dielectric constants of 39.2, 39.2, and 22.3
along the ⟨100⟩, ⟨010⟩, and ⟨001⟩
directions, respectively, with a relatively high averaged dielectric
constant of 33.5. This is expected to lead to an excellent dielectric
behavior using this material. The higher contribution to the macroscopic
dielectric tensor in this material originates from the vibrational
part (see Table 1).
This is due to the important Born effective charges in the material
originated from the important electronegativity of oxygen. As the
computed macroscopic dielectric constant for pristine CuVO3 is notably high, the capability for photoexciton dissociation to
free carriers using this material is expected to be easy. Note that
the obtained electronic part of dielectric constant in the case of
pristine CuVO3 is very close to that previously obtained
using the independent particle approximation (see Figure 4b and Table 1). This result highlights the fact that both
approaches can give reasonable optical dielectric constants of 3D
semiconductors, in which the excitonic effect is relatively weak.

To understand
the electron and hole mobilities tendency throughout
the crystalline structure of pristine CuVO3 material, we
have analyzed the hybridization character of electronic orbitals involved
in the band edges of this semiconductor. Figure 5 displays the distribution of charge densities
over the ac plane of the valence (left) and conduction
band (right) edges of pristine CuVO3 using HSE06 functional.
The valence band map indicates an important role of d-orbitals on
all Cu with lower role of p-orbitals on all O (Figure 5a). The 3D delocalization of the electronic
states on all Cu and O species located near each other in pristine
CuVO3 could help for the migration of holes throughout
its crystal structure to surface. The conduction band analysis highlights
important involvements of d-orbitals on all V with minor contribution
of p orbitals on all O inside the crystal lattice (Figure 5b). The delocalized character
of electronic states on all V and O species spatially located close
to each other tends to lead to a good ability for the excited electrons
to move throughout the CuVO3 crystal structure to surface.

(right) edge electronic states located within 0.2 eV range (based

Energetic and Conductivity Properties of
Native Defects in CuVO3
Several types of native
defects were considered
in this study, namely, Cu vacancy (labeled by Cuvac), V
vacancy (labeled by Vvac), O vacancy (labeled by Ovac), Cu-interstitial (labeled by Cuint), V-interstitial
(labeled by Vint), O-interstitial (labeled by Oint), Cu antisite on V (labeled by CuV), and V antisite on
Cu (labeled by VCu), and were modeled. Cation and anion
antisites like Cu or V on O site and O on Cu or V site were not discussed
here because of their high formation energies. In principle, Cuint, Vint, VCu, and Ovac should
be donor-like defects, whereas CuV, Cuvac, Vvac, and Oint should be accepter-like defects. The
calculated energy levels with respect to conduction band minimum (CBM)
for donors and with respect to valence band maximum (VBM) for acceptors
of native defects in CuVO3 with various charge states are
reported in Table 2. Positive or negative values for donors will mean that the donor
level is located below or above CBM. Similarly, positive or negative
values for acceptors will mean that the acceptor level is located
above or below VBM. Among the four explored donor-like defects, Cuint, Vint, VCu, and Ovac,
only Ovac is found to be a shallow donor. Its (0/+2) transition
energy level is even above the CBM of CuVO3. Besides, among
the four explored acceptor-like defects, CuV, Cuvac, Vvac, and Oint, only Cuvac is
found to be a shallow acceptor. As a result, we found that the creation
of a Cuvac does not significantly perturb the lattice upon
relaxation around the Cu-vacancy site. The relaxation led to only
0.03 Å reduction on V–O bond length for V and O species
located around the vacancy site. Such small relaxation is expected
to make relatively small perturbation in the valence band states and
therefore leads to a shallow acceptor level. A similar trend was also
found in the case of Ovac because of the small lattice
relaxation around the O-vacancy site, giving relatively weak perturbation
in the conduction band states. As a consequence, the formation of
shallow acceptors (like Cuvac) and shallow donors (like
Ovac) are at the origin of the p-type and n-type conductivities
in this material.

In general, the conductivity of a semiconducting material is not
only dependent on the donor/acceptor transition energy levels but
also on their formation energies. To give rational insights into the
impact of native defects on the conductivity of CuVO3,
the positions of Fermi-level pinning are needed to be addressed. Figure 6a,b displays the
computed formation energies of native defects as a function of Fermi
level positions under Cu-rich/O-poor and O-rich growth conditions,
respectively. The results for Cuint are not displayed because
they reveal much higher values as compared to other defect types.
For CuV and VCu, the high formation energies
can be understood by the ionic radius difference between V5+ and Cu1+. Overall, the donor formation energies are much
lower under O-poor/Cu-rich condition, whereas the acceptor formation
energies are much lower under O-rich condition. Under O-poor condition,
the Ovac formation energy of is the lowest one, and this
means that n-type conductivity of this material can be obtained from
the Ovac formation. The Fermi level was pinned at around
0.30 eV below the CBM through the Cuvac formation (dashed
vertical line in Figure 6a). The Cuvac formation energy was the lowest one under
O-rich condition enabling for the p-type conductivity of this material.
The Fermi level was pinned at around 0.40 eV above the VBM through
the Ovac formation (dashed vertical line in Figure 6b). Therefore, our calculations
demonstrate that CuVO3 needs to be prepared under O-poor/Cu-rich
condition to get n-type conductivity, and it is required to be grown
under O-rich condition to obtain p-type conductivity.

Conclusions
We performed a systematic first-principles
computational study
on native defects remaining in the CuVO3 semiconductor
material lattice using DFT to understand how they can impact the conductivity
of this material in direct correlation with its potential for solar
energy conversion application. First, we investigated the optoelectronic
properties investigated for the pristine cell such as electronic structure,
visible-light absorption coefficient spectrum, electronic and ionic
contributions to its macroscopic dielectric tensor, and the hybridization
characters of its band edges. Second, we calculated the transition
energies and formation energies of the various explored native defects
together with Fermi level pinning positions.

As for the optoelectronics
of the pristine CuVO3 material,
our calculations predicted a low and direct band gap of 1.4 eV, in
line with the required zone for developing new semiconductors for
photovoltaic devices. In addition, we have shown that this material
exhibits relatively high solar light absorption efficiency, high macroscopic
dielectric constant, and delocalized orbital characters of photogenerated
charge carriers throughout its crystal structure. These results highlighted
CuVO3 as a good candidate for photovoltaic application.

Regarding the various possible explored native defects (including
vacancies, interstitials, and antisites), we found that only those
corresponding to Cu vacancies are shallow acceptors and those corresponding
to O vacancies are shallow donors, leading, respectively, to p- and
n-type conductivities under O-rich and Cu-rich/O-poor growth conditions.

These data could be very useful for understanding the material
properties and open good perspectives for the highly crystalline CuVO3 material within a single phase to be carefully prepared and
adopted as a new class of materials for solar energy conversion applications.

Computational
Methods
The hexagonal crystalline phase of copper vanadate,
CuVO3, was considered for structural modeling based on
the experimental
determination and refinement by full-matrix least-squares procedures
using automatic diffractometer data.22 To
examine the various possible native defects in pristine CuVO3, we considered the 2 × 2 × 1 supercell model of the hexagonal
structure of pristine CuVO3, which consists of two unit
cells stacked both along the a- and b-axes (24 functional units Cu24V24O72 or 120 atoms). All crystal structures considered in this work were
fully optimized by means of the spin-polarized DFT with the PBE exchange–correlation
functional23 and the frozen-core projector
augmented-wave approach24 using VASP software.25−28 The configurations of valence electrons taken explicitly into account
in our calculations are 3d104s1 for Cu, 3p63d44s1 for V, and 2s22p4 for O. In all cases, the first Brillouin zone was modeled
with 5 × 5 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack grid29 and kinetic energy of 600 eV for electron wave functions.
Relaxation run was considered converged when the force components
on each species were less than 1 meV·Å–1, the stress was less than 0.01 GPa, energy change per species was
less than 1 meV, and displacement was less than 1 × 10–4 Å. Because each type of defect might generate a particular
magnetic state, various possible multiplicities of spin were taken
into account to identify the most favorable spin configuration.

The electronic structure of each material was optimized by DFT
through VASP package using the HSE06 functional,30,31 where the standard mixture of 25% Hartree–Fock and 75% PBE
was taken into account at short range interaction with the default
value of 0.2 Å for range separation. The optical dielectric tensor
(ε∞)ij of pristine
CuVO3 was determined using the HSE06 functional with VASP,
either from the real part of the dielectric function ε1(ω) plot in terms of incident photon energy at the band gap
energy or by investigating the self-consistent interaction of the
material with an external electric field, which includes the local
field effects.32 The use of HSE06 functional
is needed to more accurately describe (ε∞)ij based on the good description of the obtained
band gap energy. This contribution directly correlated with the electron
density polarizability of the material. The ionic dielectric tensor
(εvib)ij was acquired
using the linear response approach with the PBE functional through
DFPT. This contribution is directly dependent on the polarization
induced by the softest vibrational frequencies. The macroscopic dielectric
tensor (ε0)ij was quantified
through the summation of both parts.

The steady production of
CuVO3 under thermal equilibrium
growth conditions is given by the following expression33,34 1  where μCu, μV, and μO are the Cu, V, and O chemical potentials,
respectively. ΔHf is the enthalpy
of formation for CuVO3 per functional unit.

For native
defects formation energy calculation, we followed the
mixing scheme taking into account the benefits of specific k-point and Γ-point approach that has been successfully
applied to a large variety of semiconductors.33−37 For a native defect δ with a charge q, the enthalpy of formation ΔHf(δ,q) is dependent on the relative
Fermi-level position (EF) to the VBM,
on the transition level ε(0/q), as well as
on the chemical potential μi as
follows 2  where ΔHf(δ,0) is given by 3  E(bulk,0) and E(δ,0) are
the respective total energies of systems without
and with a neutral defect. Ei is the energy per atom of each element. For an acceptor (q < 0), the relative transition energy to VBM determines
how shallow or deep the defect level is and can be written as follows 4  

The single-electron
defect level was calculated using only Γ-point
and the structural and Coulomb relaxations were calculated using special k-points. The relative electron ionization energy to the
CBM for a donor (q > 0) determines how shallow
or
deep the defect level is and can be written as follows 5  

As displayed in eqs 2 and 3, the computed
formation energies for
charged native defects are dependent on μCu, μV, and μO values as well as on the Fermi-level
positions. We presented here results under two representative growing
conditions such as Cu-rich/O-poor and O-rich.
