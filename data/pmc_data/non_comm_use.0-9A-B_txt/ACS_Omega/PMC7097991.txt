A series
of excellent works have demonstrated that high-nitrogen-content
metal pentazolate (cyclo-N5–) compounds could be stabilized by high pressure. However, under
ambient conditions, low stability precludes their synthesis and application
in the field of high-energy-density material. In this work, by using
a constrained structure search method, we predicted two new structures
as P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 containing cyclo-N5– with strong N–N and Cu–N bonds. In both structures, cyclo-N5– form four coordination
with the Cu+ ligand, which increases the structural stability
by lowering the disturbance to the aromaticity of cyclo-N5–. The calculated results show that
the P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 structures exhibit high dynamic and thermal stability up
to 400 K, indicating that they can be stabilized under ambient conditions.
The decomposing energy of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 can reach up to 2.40 and 2.42
kJ/g, respectively. Strikingly, the detonation velocity and the pressure
of P212121-CuN5 is predicted to be up to 10.42 km/s and 617.46 kbar, respectively,
indicating that they are promising high-energy candidates in the field
of explosive combustion.

1 Introduction
The
pentazolate anion (cyclo-N5–), behaving like a five-membered ring solely composed
of nitrogen atoms, has attracted great interest because of its great
potential application as a high-energy-density material.1−4 Because of the large energy difference between triple-bond dinitrogen
(N≡N, ∼954 kJ/mol) and single (N–N, ∼160
kJ/mol) or double (N=N, ∼418 kJ/mol) nitrogen, an enormous
amount of energy could be released during the unique transformation
of N–N bonds in cyclo-N5– to N≡N bonds. Moreover, the carbon- and hydrogen-free products
(nitrogen only) make it a potential eco-friendly superior explosive
material. However, the low stability of the metastable structure of cyclo-N5– compounds under ambient
conditions impedes their synthesis and application.5,6

Recently, tremendous experimental and theoretical efforts have
demonstrated that high pressure can be used to stabilize the pentazolate
anion. Many metal pentazolate compounds (e.g., LiN5, NaN5, CsN5, AlN15, and MgN10)
have been synthesized and predicted by high pressure, but few metal
pentazolate compounds could be quenched down to ambient conditions.7−15 On the other hand, a ligand effect plays an important role in pentazolate
compounds under ambient conditions.16 In
previous studies, Xu et al. and Zhang et al. successfully synthesized
some metal and metal-free pentazolate hydrates by H+ or
a sole metal ligand, such as [Na(H2O)(N5)]·2H2O and (N5)6(H3O)3(NH4)4Cl salts.17−19 Lu et al. reported hydrogen
bonding network pentazolate compounds.20−23 Wang et al. successfully obtained
Na20N60 and Na24N60 nanocages
in the zeolitic architecture.24 Although
the produced compounds exhibit good thermal stability, the amount
of redundant ligand (such as H2O) used to stabilize them
would weaken their explosive performance. Therefore, further works
are needed to find new, water-free, stable, and high-performance pentazolate
compounds under ambient conditions.

Cu+ is an excellent
ligand in many compounds Li et al.
reported a simple route for the synthesis of CuN5 compounds
via compressing CuN6 at 50 GPa.25 Lu et al. obtained three-dimensional (3D) framework Cu(N5)(N3) compounds by chemical synthesis.26 Motivated by this, by directly using a constrained structure
search method, here, we predicted that Cu+ could coordinate
with cyclo-N5– in different
coordinated configurations; two new phases such as P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 are more
stable under ambient conditions compared with others, owing to forming
more coordination bonds. These two stabilized CuN5 structures
exhibit lower energy and high dynamic, optical, and thermal stability
(up to 400 K). The bond analysis reveals that cyclo-N5– maintains its strong N–N
bonding while it binds with Cu under ambient conditions. The decomposing
energy of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 can reach up to 2.40 and 2.42 kJ/g, respectively.
Strikingly, the detonation velocity and pressure of P212121-CuN5 is predicted
to be up to 10.42 km/s and 617.46 kbar, respectively, indicating that
they are promising eco-friendly and high-energy candidates as high-power
energetic materials.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure and Stability
Through
a direct constrained structure search at 0 GPa, as summarized in Table 1, here we reported
two CuN5 compounds, named as P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5, possessing much
lower energy than that in the previously reported CuN5 (P21/m-CuN5, obtained
at high pressure),25 as illustrated in Figure 1. The lattice constants
and atomic coordinate positions are shown in Table S1. Compared with P21/m-CuN5, each Cu atom in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 binds with four
different cyclo-N5– rings
and forms a tetrahedron linked by Cu–N coordinative bonds.
The lengths of Cu–N bonds are 1.79, 2.02, 2.03, and 2.10 Å
in the P212121-CuN5 phase, while 1.98, 2.02, 2.03, and 2.11 Å in the P21/c-CuN5 phase.
In comparison with the bond length of Cu–N in known Cu(N5)(N3) (2.03 and 2.54 Å),26 the Cu+ in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 forms a stronger coordination
bond with N atoms. The four N atoms in a planar cyclo-N5– are bonded with the neighboring
Cu atom. The bond length of N–N on average is around 1.33 Å
in both P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 phases, which is between the N–N single bond (1.45
Å) and the N=N double bond (1.25 Å), and close to
that in P21/c-LiN5 (1.32 Å), [Na(H2O)(N5)]·2H2O (1.33 Å) and [Mg(H2O)6(N5)2]·4H2O (1.32 Å),13,17 indicating its uniqueness for cyclo-N5– rings.

ambient condition, respectively.

Table 1 The Coordination Unit and Energy of
CuN5 Compounds
compounds	coordination
unit	energy (meV/formula)	
P212121-CuN5	Cu tetrahedron, η4-N5	0.00	
P21/c-CuN5	Cu tetrahedron, η4-N5	25.78	
P4/1-CuN5	Cu triangle, η3-N5	63.72	
P21/m-CuN5	Cu linear, η2-N5	424.53	
As shown in Table 1, the coordination numbers of the Cu+ ion in P41-CuN5 and P21/m-CuN5 (Figure S1) are 3 and 2, respectively, which are
both smaller than the coordination
number of the Cu ion in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5. Although the length of Cu–N
bonds in P41-CuN5 and P21/m-CuN5 is 0.08
and 0.17 Å shorter than P212121-CuN5 on average, respectively, the
energy of P41-CuN5 and P21/m-CuN5 is 63.73
and 424.53 meV per formula, respectively, higher than that of P212121-CuN5. Moreover, P21/c-CuN5 are composed of a similar coordination unit and show different
atomic configurations with P212121-CuN5; the energy of P21/c-CuN5 is 25.78 meV per formula,
higher than P212121-CuN5, and still lower than P41-CuN5 and P21/m-CuN5. We could conclude that the high coordination number
and right coordination configuration would lower the energy of CuN5 compounds, and the ligand effect could play an important
role in stabilizing CuN5 under ambient condition.

The dynamic stabilities are further evaluated by calculating their
phonon spectra. Figure 2a,b shows the calculated phonon dispersion along high-symmetry directions
and phonon density of states (DOS) for P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5, respectively. All
acoustic branch frequencies are positive, ensuring that both the structures
of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 are dynamically stable. For both structures, we can see that
the atomic motions are separated in phonon PDOS and the metal atom
modes are right below the cyclo-N5– ring modes; the high-energy modes (>20 THz) consist
of N–N vibrations modes, which indicates that the cyclo-N5– ring is stable by the strong N–N
bonds. The overlaps between Cu atom modes and N–N modes show
lower energy modes (<10.6 THz), which are resulted from the translational
motion of the Cu atom and cyclo-N5–.

respectively. Evolution of total energy as a function of time step
at 400 K and snapshots of the initial and final structures of (c) P212121-CuN5 and (d) P21/c-CuN5 in AIMD simulations at 0 and 10 ps, respectively.

Since the stability under ambient conditions is one of the
key
factors for potential high-density-energy materials, we further examined
the stability of the P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 structures at a fine temperature by molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. The calculations were performed at 300,
400, 600, and 800 K for 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs. Both predicted
structures of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 did not suffer a large shape change up to 400 K,
which is more stable than P21/m-CuN5 (300 K).25 The
closest averaged lengths of the N–N, Cu–N, and Cu–Cu
bonds in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 (Figure S2) are statistically
analyzed from the last 4 ps, estimated to be around 1.34(1.34), 1.97(1.99),
and 3.712(3.71) Å. The bond lengths have just a small shift from
the calculated results at 0 K, indicating their good structural stability.
When temperature increases up to 600 K, the Cu–N bonds start
to decompose (Figure S3), which is different
from the decomposition path of phenylentazoles (PhN5).
In the latter case, the decomposition starts from the breaking of
the N5– ring.27,28

The synthesis method is optional, especially since the pentazolate
salts ([Na(H2O)(N5)]·2H2O and
Cu(N5)(N3)) are now available, we need not to
break the C–N bond in PhN5, P212121-CuN5, and P21/c-CuN5, which could be
directly synthesized via removing the N3– group from Cu(N5)(N3). The high-pressure and
laser heating are also very popular synthesis methods, which have
been successfully applied to the synthesis of CsN5 and
LiN5.12,14 Li et al. reported that P21/m-CuN5 could
be synthesized via compressing CuN6 at 50 GPa; here we
calculated the enthalpy of P212121-CuN5-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 by setting known P21/m-CuN5 as the
reference zero point. The results indicate that both the enthalpy
of P212121-CuN5 and that of P21/c-CuN5 have negative values when pressure increases up
to about 40 GPa (Figure S4), which indicates
that these compounds have the possibility to be synthesized by releasing
pressure from P21/m-CuN5.

2.2 Optical Stability and Decomposition Route
Here, we further explored their optical stability and decomposition
mechanism. The electronic structures and DOS for P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 were calculated
at the HSE06 level and are depicted in Figure 3, P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 were both insulators with a band
gap of 4.12 and 3.98 eV, respectively. The N 2p orbit makes main contributions
to the conduction band minimum (CBM) by partial DOS calculations,
whereas the Cu 3d electron mainly contributes to the valence band
maximum (VBM). This is similar to many conventional semiconductors
such as GaN in which the VBM states mainly consist of the p orbitals
of the anions and the CBM states mainly consist of the s and p orbitals
of the cations. The band gaps of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 are both large and the
bands near the VMB and CMB are both flat, which indicates a large
electron effective mass and that the electron transition from the
valence band to the conduction band is difficult. Combined with our
optical calculations and analysis, the large band gap induces weak
optical absorption above 300 nm along each direction, indicating their
high optical stability. Furthermore, as shown in Figure S5, the band gap decreases when pressure increases,
so P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 have higher optical stability at lower pressure.29

The decomposition route is important for P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5. The electron localization
function (ELF) projected on the cycle-N5– plane (Figure 4a,b) demonstrates that valence electrons strongly localize
on N–N bonds and the lone pairs are around nitrogen atoms,
but weaker electrons localize between Cu–N bonds, which indicates
that the strength of Cu–N bonds might be much weaker than that
of N–N bonds. The Bader charge analysis30 shows that there are 0.78 electron transferred from each
Cu atom to neighbor cycle-N5– rings, which indicates that cycle-N5– is stabilized by the ligand effect of Cu atoms.
As shown in Figure 4c,d, the charge distribution on cycle-N5– in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 is more homogeneous than P21/m-CuN5 and P41-CuN5 (Figure S6a,b), indicating that P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 with more Cu coordination
numbers have lower disturbance to the aromaticity of cyclo-N5–. To further characterize the chemical
bonds in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 more quantitatively, we calculated the crystal orbital
Hamilton population (-pCOHP) curves implemented in the LOBSTER program.31 The calculations results (Figure 4e,4f) indicate that
the nitrogen p-wave electrons make contributions to the strong covalent
bonding interaction in cycle-N5– rings, but for the Cu–N bond, the electron occupation part
exists on a small antibonding orbital. The integrated COHP values
of N–N bonds in P212121-CuN5, P21/c-CuN5, P41-CuN5, and P21/m-CuN5 are −14.27, −14.22, −13.12, and −13.15,
respectively. Comparing the COHP of the N–N bond in P21/m-CuN5 and P41-CuN5 (Figure S6c,d), the lower disturbance to the aromaticity of cyclo-N5– in P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 makes
less electron occupation on the antibonding orbital and shows more
stable properties. Combined with the calculated results of ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD), we can conclude that the decomposition
of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 first occurs at Cu–N bonds, and the more coordinal
bonds of Cu–N would enhance the stability of pentazolate salts
by increasing the aromaticity of cycle-N5– ring.

lines represent the energy level of the top of the valence bands.

2.3 Explosive Performance
The lower energy
of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 increased the stability of P21/m-CuN525 but decreased explosive properties. Here, we
calculate the chemical energies when they dissociate into stable Cu3N2 solid and dinitrogen gas under ambient conditions.
Taking into consideration the energy reduction for dinitrogen gas
relative to the α nitrogen phase (around 0.25 eV/atom),32 the chemical energy densities (Ed) of dense P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 are estimated to be about 2.40
and 2.42 kJ/g in the dissociation of CuN5 (s) →
Cu3N (s) + N2 (g) by referring the energy of
their most stable phase at 0 GPa.33,34 As shown in Table 2, we further use the
empirical Kamlet–Jacobs equation9,15,35 by Vd = 1.01(NM0.5Ed0.5)0.5(1 + 1.30ρ)
and Pd = 15.58ρ2NM0.5Ed0.5 to calculate
the detonation velocity and pressure (Vd, Pd) to evaluate the explosive performance.
The release energies of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 are a bit lower than those of
TNT and HMX, but the Vd and Pd (10.42 km/s and 617.46 kbar for P212121-CuN5, 9.72 km/s and
517.46 kbar for P21/c-CuN5) are higher than those of TNT, HMX32,35 and even recently reported MgN10.9 These high performances indicate the potential application of P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 in high explosives.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we reported two novel stable CuN5 structures
under ambient condition, named as P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5. Both ab initio MD and
phonon spectrum simulations confirm their stability under ambient
condition. By the chemical bond analysis, we reveal that the stability
of cycle-N5– is benefited
from a ligand effect by a higher Cu+ coordination number.
These nitrogen-rich salts show high energy density (2.40 kJ/g for P212121-CuN5 and 2.42 kJ/g for P21/c-CuN5), while they are decomposed into stable Cu3N2 and nitrogen gas. Both P212121-CuN5 and P21/c-CuN5 have higher detonation
velocity and pressure than those of TNT or HMX. In particular, the
detonation velocity and pressure of P212121-CuN5 are about twice those
of TNT, indicating good application prospects in the field of eco-friendly
powerful explosives.

4 Calculational Methods
To explore the most stable structures of pentazolate compounds
under ambient conditions, a molecular crystal search method was carried
out to search those high-energy compounds using the particle swarm
optimization (PSO) algorithm as implemented in the CALYPSO code.36−39 Through this method, the bond connectivity of N atoms in cyclo-N5– rings could be restrained
during the evolution of the structures. Using this method, we directly
searched the most metastable structures of CuN5 compounds
under 0 GPa with four to six times CuN5 units; the total
1400 structures were considered and ranked according to their calculated
energy.

The local structural relaxations and electronic structures
calculations
are carried out in the framework of density functional theory (DFT),
implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40,41 The projector augmented wave method42 is used to describe the pseudopotential. The exchange-correlation
function in DFT calculations is implemented by generalized gradient
approximation using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional.43 In the electron–ion interaction, 3s23p63d9 and 2s22p3 are treated as valence electrons for Cu and N atoms, respectively.
A plane-wave basis cut-off energy is set to 700 eV for the span of
the one-electron wave function. The conjugate gradient scheme is used
to optimize the atomic positions and lattice constants until the residual
Hellmann–Feynman forces on each atom were less than 0.01 eV/Å,
and the energy is converged until the change is smaller than 1.0 ×
10–5 eV/atom. Brillouin zone integrations were sampled
using a Monkhorst–Pack44 k-point
mesh with a resolution of 2π0.03Å–1.
To get an accurate electronic structure, we used hybrid functional
implemented by the framework of Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof
(HSE06).45 The absorption spectrum could
be calculated by  where E is the energy
of
the incident light, and  and  are the real and imaginary part of the
frequency-dependent dielectric function, respectively.46 The expensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations were performed at a finite temperature at the NVT ensemble
to analyze the dynamic properties. The phonon spectrum calculations
were also carried out using a finite displacement approach with the
PHONOPY code.47,48 The qvasp was used to pre- and
postprocess VASP calculated data.
