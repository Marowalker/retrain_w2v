Aromatic
foldamers possess well-defined cavity that can be stabilized
by discrete intramolecular interactions including hydrogen bonding,
solvophobicity, electrostatic repulsion, or coordination. Long foldamers
can form dynamic deep helical tubular architectures that are not only
structurally attractive but also useful hosts for guest encapsulation,
chirality induction, delivery, and catalysis. This kind of helical
tubular structures can be formed by single molecules or macromolecules
or by connecting short-folded or helical segments through noncovalent
or covalent forces. This perspective summarizes the recent advances
on the construction of helical tubes and their properties and functions.

1 Introduction
Tubular structures are attractive targets in chemical and materials
sciences because they are important scaffolds for the development
of new functions and applications.1−3 For carbon nanotubes
and many other kinds of inorganic or composite nanotubes that exist
only in the solid state, studies on their properties and functions
are mainly limited to surfaces or interfaces. In contrast, molecular
and supramolecular tubular structures are relatively flexible and
more processible, and their cavity size can also be regulated much
more easily. Moreover, modification and functionalization can be carried
out from both inside and outside of the tubes. Therefore, in the past
2 decades, the construction of such family of “soft”
tubular structures has received great attention. One classic family
of such molecular tubes is that formed by covalent connection of cyclodextrins
in the presence of linear templates.1−3 However, the cavity of
this kind of tubular structures is defined by the macrocycles which
does not allow for further modulation. Uni(macro)molecular and multicomponent
self-assembly on the basis of folded and helical conformations of
their backbones provide another efficient approach for the generation
of tubular structures. The diversity of the repeat segments and/or
molecular components and accurate design of the backbones well enable
the regulation and variation of the cavity diameter and depth of such
kind of tubular structures. As a result, a large number of helical
molecular and macromolecular tubes have been developed in the past
decades.

α-Helix is the most important secondary structure
of natural
peptides and proteins. In 1974, Nolte et al. reported that polyisocyanides
could form rigid helical conformations.4 In 1980s, Seebach and co-workers developed efficient methods to
synthesize chiral β-amino acids from which they could build
short unnatural peptides that formed defined secondary structures.5,6 Subsequent works by Gellman on β- and α/β-peptides
revealed the formation of many elaborate artificial helical structures,7,8 which led to the research field of foldamer chemistry.8 However, because of their intrinsic structural
nature, helical backbones formed by either natural or unnatural aliphatic
amino acids are not able to generate hollow conformations. In contrast,
aromatic backbones are more rigid to allow for the formation of hollow
cavities.9,10 In 1997, Moore et al. demonstrated this
concept by using oligo(meta-phenylene ethynylene)s which formed a
well-defined tubular conformation of ca. 0.7 nm diameter.9 In 2001, Gong proposed that larger hollow cavity
could be generated from folded aromatic amide oligomers by hybridizing
meta- and para-substituted benzene rings in the backbones.11 These seminal works remarkably inspired extensive
studies for the construction of helical molecular tubes.

Long
molecular tubes not only are structurally fascinating and
important but also may exhibit new unique functions because they can
produce microenvironments that are different from those formed by
short foldamers or macrocycles of the identical repeat segments. Currently,
such long helical tubes have been generated by single long oligomers
and polymers or by the self-assembly of short oligomers driven by
intermolecular noncovalent interactions. Many of these molecular and
polymeric tubes have been revealed to display interesting properties
or functions in, such as, molecular recognition and entrapment, chirality
induction and transfer, ion transport, and reaction promotion or catalysis.
This perspective summarizes the advances that concern the sequences
that have more than one turn.

2 Helical Single Molecular
Tubes
Aromatic oligomers can fold into helical conformations
driven by
intramolecular π–π stacking driven by solvophobicity
or intramolecular hydrogen bonding.12−15 Long oligomers can produce helices
with ≥1 turn that form a deep tubular cavity for hosting guests
of various sizes and shapes. Since 1997, several aromatic systems
have been designed and developed as long helical foldamers. Their
cavity diameter is typically well-defined, but the depth may vary
considerably, depending on the backbone length and units per turn.

2.1 Oligo(arylene ethynylene) Backbones
Oligo(m-phenylene ethynylene)s developed by Moore
et al. represent the first series of aromatic backbones that folded
into helical conformations driven solvophobically in polar media,
typically acetonitrile.9 For this kind
of backbones, at least seven repeat phenylene ethynylene units are
required to allow for folding into one turn, i.e., the two benzene
rings at the ends can stack each other intramolecularly. Thus, for
the formation of stable helical conformations, relatively long backbones
(≥10-mer) are required, which means that at least four stacking
interactions are needed to stabilize the helical conformation. Given
the rigidity of the backbones, this kind of helical tubes has a fixed
inner diameter of approximately 0.7 nm. For 18-mer oligomer 1 (Figure 1), the compact helical state produces a tubular structure of ca.
1.1 nm depth. The triglyme monomethyl ether group provided good solubility
in organic solvents of discrete polarity. In benign chloroform of
low polarity, aromatic stacking was very weak, and thus, the oligomers
were conformationally flexible. Chiral triglyme monomethyl ether group
induced 18-mer 2 to exhibit a strong Cotton effect with
an exciton couplet in acetonitrile,16 indicating
a highly ordered helical conformation in which the chiral side chains
biased the handedness of the backbone. In contrast, in chloroform
an 18-mer analogue that bore no chirality centers showed no optical
activity, pointing to a random conformation. Moore et al. also demonstrated
that the hydrophobic cavity of helical oligo(m-phenylene
ethynylene)s are good receptors for monoterpene guests. For rod-like
chiral guests like 3a and 3b, the helices
showed significant length- and shape-dependence.17 In 40% aqueous acetonitrile, 3a had a complementary
length to the cylindrical cavity of 20-mer 4a and 22-mer 4b, whereas for 3b, these two oligomers displayed
even higher specificity. In contrast, longer 24-mer 4c was found to have a lower affinity for 3b relative
to 4a and 4b because of the steric hindrance
of the triphenylmethyl capping groups of 3b.

Figure 1 Helical conformation
of the aromatic backbone of 18-mer 1, highlighting an
inner diameter of 0.7 nm and depth of 1.1 nm. The
side chains and end groups have been removed.

The benzene subunits of the above oligomers have been replaced
with pyridine, (bi)indole, or indolocarbazole segments, which led
to the generation of several new sequences.18−20 In this category,
Inouye and Abe had prepared oligo(m-ethynylpyridine)s 5a and 5b that had 18 and 24 repeat units,18 respectively, which corresponded to three and
four turns of their respective helical backbone. In solution, this
kind of aromatic sequences has been revealed to adopt unfolded conformations
because the pyridine nitrogen atoms are favorably located on the opposite
sides of the C≡C bonds which could attenuate the dipoles of
the pyridine rings. Both 5a and 5b showed
induced circular dichroism (CD) through binding chiral monosaccharides
in less polar organic solvents such as dichloromethane, whereas shorter
analogues did not, showing that these long oligomers possessed stronger
binding affinity through forming helical conformations, which exhibited
helicity bias due to the induction of the chiral guests. Compared
with that of the benzene- and pyridine-based oligomers, the repeat
degrees of the larger indole (6a and 6b)
and indolocarbazole (7a and 7b) oligomers,
all developed by Jeong et al., are lower. Both series of backbones
are inherently flexible. However, their high aspect ratio still enabled
deep helical conformations. Thus, in acetonitrile, sulfate anion-induced 6a and 6b to fold into helical conformations
that had 2 or 2.5 turns.19 The carboxylate
group of 7a and 7b provided solubility in
water.20 In water, the two oligomers could
encapsulate chloride anion through helical conformation that had 1
or 1.5 turns.

2.2 Oligo(aromatic amide and
hydrazide) Backbones
Hydrogen bonding-driven aromatic amide
and hydrazide oligomers
constitute another large family of molecular tubes which have a cavity
of different inner diameters. Compounds 8–15 are
the longest oligomers of the representative sequences in this category.11,21−27 Chen et al. reported that the two adjacent amide units of 12 did not form intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Instead,
they produced large torsion but still allowed the formation of intramolecular
five-membered N–H···N hydrogen bonding, which
induced the backbone to stack compactly to produce a helix of four
turns with no cavity (Figure 2).26 All other oligomers are induced
by successive intramolecular hydrogen bonding to form a tubular helical
conformation. One of us found that in chloroform the cavity of 9 and 15 could bind alkylated chiral saccharides
by forming intermolecular multiple N–H···O hydrogen
bonding, which also led to important helicity bias of the hosts.21,27 As expected, the binding of 13-mer 15 toward saccharide
guests was stronger because of its deeper cavity (ca. 2.5 turns).
We also found that the cavity of 10 and 11 was smaller but could still host aliphatic ammoniums.22,23 Zeng reported the crystal structure of 13 and 14 which revealed that the contractive geometry of the pyridine
ring and the intramolecular hydrogen bonding caused that a little
more than four repeat units formed one turn.24,25 In this helical conformation, the two farthest pyridine rings underwent
partial stacking to produce a small cavity that hosted water molecules
stabilized by intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Figure 3).25 Pyridine-derived
amide oligomers can also form double, triple, or quadruple helices.
However, these more complicated helical structures typically produce
even smaller cavity which is not able to host any guest.14,28−30 8-Aminoquinoline-2-carboxylic acid-derived amide
oligomers can produce one turn with only three repeat units, and a
13-turn helix has been constructed from this segment, which has a
length of 5.1 nm.31

oligomer 12, showing the small
cavity of the helical conformation that hosts water molecules through
intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Figure 3 Crystal structure of oligomer 14, showing no cavity
of the helical conformation.

Huc and co-workers introduced a general approach of designing
hollow
helical tubes by incorporating different heterocycles, including pyridine,
quinoline, pyrido[3,2-g]quinoline, 1,8-naphthyridine, or pyridazine,
into one sequence.32 The resulting single
molecular capsules are able to entrap small solvents, alkali and alkaline
earth metal ions, or organic acid guests.33−35 With rationally
designed linear molecules as templates, a number of single and double
helices have been induced to form long tubular structures to thread
the guests to form unique dynamic interlocked supramolecular systems.32

2.3 Oligo(aromatic triazole)
and Hybrid Backbones
The C5–H atom of 1,2,3-triazole
is a weak hydrogen
donor because of the electron-withdrawing effect of the three nitrogen
atoms. Thus, 1,2,3-triazole can form both intermolecular and intramolecular
hydrogen bonding. The intermolecular hydrogen bonding has been used
to induce benzene-triazole-alternate oligomers to fold into helical
conformations.36 For example, Craig et
al. reported that 16 folded into one-turn helix by forming
intermolecular multiple C–H···Cl– hydrogen bonds.37 With halide anions
as the template, longer oligomers incorporating benzene and pyridine
units formed tubular helices with deeper cavity, and the binding may
occur in organic and aqueous media, as demonstrated by Hecht and Jiang
et al.38−40 We found that intramolecular C–H···OR
or C–H···F hydrogen bonding can also induce
the same kind of oligomers to fold into helical conformations.41,42 This kind of foldamers has a cavity of approximately 1.8 nm, and
oligomer 17 is the longest one that forms more than one
turn of helical conformation.41 All the
N-2 and N-3 atoms of the triazole rings are orientated inward and
they were revealed to form intermolecular N···ICF2 halogen bonds with organohalogens, such as triiodide 18, in dichloromethane or its mixture with n-hexane.

In the absence of intramolecular and intermolecular
hydrogen bonding, aromatic triazole oligomers are usually conformationally
flexible. Our group illustrated that when one or two such inherently
flexible segments were attached to a hydrogen-bonded folded amide
segment of at least four repeat units, the resulting hybrids, such
as 19–21, underwent folding-inducing-folding to
give rise to a new kind of hybridized tubular helices in apolar solvents
like benzene and n-hexane (Figure 4).43 However,
in benign chloroform or dichloromethane, this process did not occur.
Thus, we attributed this induction process to solvophobically driven
intramolecular stacking between the folded amide segment and the attached
triazole segment(s). Moreover, for enantiomers R-20 and S-20, the chiral group
was able to induce the whole framework to generate strong helicity
bias, suggesting the formation of chiral helical tubes. Molecular
dynamic modeling showed that the longest oligomer 21 produced
a helical tube that has about four turns with a depth of 1.1 nm.

of oligomers 19, chiral R-20 and 21.

3 Helical Single Macromolecular Tubes
The preparation of long oligomers requires multistep synthesis
and is usually time-consuming. Linear polymers are much easier to
obtain by one-step coupling of rationally designed bifunctional precursors
and thus have attracted great attention of chemists for the generation
of macromolecular tubes of deep cavity.44 Reported macromolecular backbones have been developed on the basis
of their oligomeric analogues. However, the driving forces for the
formation of helical conformations may be different.

3.1 Poly(arylene
ethynylene) Backbones
Hecht and Khan developed the first
example of polymeric tubular helices
from m-phenylene ethynylene-based backbones.45 Pd-catalyzed coupling of diiodine 22 and ethynyltrimethylsilane afforded polymer P23 (Scheme 1), which has a number-average
degree of polymerization (DP) of 60 and a typical polydispersity index
(PDI) of 1.3. As expected, this polymer folded into the dynamic helical
state in polar acetonitrile, as observed for its oligomeric analogues.
Solvent denaturation experiments in binary chloroform and acetonitrile,
by monitoring the population of random-coiled and helical conformations
through differences in the transoid and cisoid absorptions, revealed
the cooperative folding behavior of the backbone, and the helical
conformation was more stable than that of shorter oligomers. Cross-chain
[2 + 2] photodimerization of P23 in acetonitrile led
to the formation of side chain-cross-linked helix P24 (Scheme 1). The absorption
spectrum of P24 in acetonitrile revealed no significant
changes with the addition of increasing amount of the chloroform denaturant,
which indicated that its locked helical conformation was stable and
the addition of chloroform did not cause de-folding. By assuming one
that turn had six repeat units, a DP of 60 suggested that polymeric
helices P23 and P24 should have about ten
turns and thus a depth of approximately 3.5 nm.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Polymers P23 and P24 (DBU
= 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene)
Hecht et al. also prepared poly(propylene oxide)-poly(m-phenylene ethynylene) blocks and graft copolymers P25 that had a low DP of 8–11 for the
aromatic backbone.46 These polymers were
found to partially fold
into helical conformation in methanol. Their CD spectrum in methanol
or chloroform all exhibited a positive signal in the region of the
polyethylene glycol backbone absorption. However, no bisignate exciton
couplet was observed related to the helical conformation of the helical
poly(m-phenylene ethynylene) segment, indicating
that chirality transfer to the helical aromatic backbone did not occur,
probably because of the fact that the backbones were too short.

Inouye and Abe and co-workers found that, as its oligomeric analogues
(5a and 5b), poly(m-ethynylpyridine) P26 was also conformationally flexible in chloroform.18 Upon binding chiral alkylated saccharides, both
oligomers and polymer were induced to produce helicity bias for the
resulting tubular helices. P26 could extract native monosaccharides
into less polar organic solvent such as chloroform. By introducing
hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) chains, the resulting polymers were
found to be water-soluble and complex-native saccharides.47 The complexation should take place also through
forming helical conformations. Because this binding was relatively
weaker, enhanced intramolecular π stacking might make greater
contribution in stabilizing the helical conformations. When chiral
hydrophilic side chains were introduced, the resulting water-soluble
polymers R- and S-P27, which had different molecular weights and sizes depending on the
fractions obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), displayed
different induced CD signals which related to the aromatic backbones,
depending on,48 while the heaviest fractions
exhibited CD responses to chiral mannose, cyclodextrins, and polysaccharides,
which was attributed to the formation of the single helix and its
conversion to more complicated entangled intramolecular duplex. Polymer S-P28, which bore both chiral and achiral hydrophilic
side chains, was soluble in both polar and apolar organic solvents.49 This polymer could complex metal salts in water
or aqueous ethanol. This binding led to positive Cotton effect and
hypochromism around 360 nm, which had been ascribed to the coordination
of the cations to the amide side chains. This coordination was proposed
to enhance the intramolecular aromatic stacking and consequently the
helicity bias.

3.2 Poly(aromatic amide) Backbones
and Analogues
Arylamide-based helical polymers represent
a large family of backbones
that can form helical tubes with tunable diameter and depth. The condensation
of isophthalic acid and benzene-1,3-diamine has been studied in solution
and the solid state,50,51 which afforded poly(m-phenyleneisophthalamide). However, their insolubility did not allow
any studies on the conformations of the backbones. As the extension
of oligomer 11,23 Guan and
one of us designed the preparation of polymer P30 from
the self-coupling reaction of 29 in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) (Scheme 2).52 Nevertheless, the reaction
actually afforded polymer P30′ as a result of
the decomposition of the methoxyl groups to hydroxyl groups (71%)
during the reaction. Treatment of P30′ with methyl
sulfate led to the formation of polymer P30. The molecular
weight of P30 (Mn = 2.43
KD, PDI = 1.47) was lower than that of P30′ (Mn = 3.75 KD, PDI = 1.72). This difference was
attributed to the flexible conformation of P30′ because of the changed hydrogen bonding motif of the hydroxyl groups
and the helical conformation of P30, which displayed
an underestimated molecular weight.53 Polymer P30 was estimated to have about three helical turns, which
corresponded to a cavity depth of 1.1 nm. This helical conformation
possesses a very small cavity, whose binding for chiral 1-phenylethan-1-amine
induced the polymer to exhibit an excess of one particular helical
handedness through intermolecular hydrogen bonding.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Polymers P30′ and P30
Zhu and Gong and co-workers also prepared polymers P31a–c to study the effect of the solvent on the folding
of the backbones.54 The two alkoxyl groups
on the isophthalamide
units formed stable intramolecular O–H···N hydrogen
bonding to favor the helical state, whereas the 3,5-diaminobenzamide
moieties could not. The Mn’s of P31a–c were determined to be 10.2, 18.6, and 35.1 KD,
which corresponded to helical tubes having roughly 5, 9, and 18 turns,
respectively. All of the polymers had low molecular weight dispersity
(1.02 to 1.03) and thus very narrow distributed lengths. The side
chain amide units were evidenced to form cross-turn hydrogen bonding
to stabilize the helical conformation, whereas the chiral side chains
transferred the chirality to the backbones to induce helicity bias
in chloroform. Notably, the intensity of the resulting Cotton effects
was correlated with their respective helix length, indicating that
induction of the chiral side chains displayed cooperativity.

Typically, aromatic amide-based oligomers and polymers need to
use intramolecular hydrogen bonding to stabilize their folded or helical
conformations. Our study showed that in the absence of such intramolecular
hydrogen bonding, oligomeric backbones prefer to form intermolecular
hydrogen-bonded duplexes.55 To further
explore the possibility of using aromatic stacking to induce the folding
of aromatic amide backbones, we also prepared polymer P32a.56 This polymer had Mn and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 32.0 and 59.0 KD, respectively, which corresponded
to a weight dispersity of 1.8 and a 9-turn helix with a depth of ca.
3.1 nm. Molecular dynamics modeling showed that the cavity had a size
of 1.3 nm (Figure 5). P32a was found to form tubular helices in water and
many organic solvents of varying polarity. It was proposed that in
water or polar organic solvents, solvophobicity was the main driving
force, whereas in less polar organic solvents, both solvophobicity
and cross-turn hydrogen bonding made important contributions. N-Methylated polymer P32b was not soluble in
water and only formed the helical conformation in polar organic solvents
such as methanol, supporting that solvophobicity played a key role
in inducing the formation of the helical conformation. When the 1,8-naphthalimide
unit was replaced with smaller naphthalene, the resulting polymer
did not spontaneously fold into helical conformation. However, chiral
natural amino acid anions could induce the formation and helicity
bias of the helical conformation in chloroform through forming multiple
intermolecular hydrogen bonding.57 With
2,2′-bipyridine being introduced into the backbones, its binding
toward Ni2+ could lead to the formation of two different
helical tubes through the configuration overturn of the bipyridine
units.58

Figure 5 (a) Side and (b) top views of the optimized
right-handed helix
formed by polymer P32a of 9 turns with a cavity diameter
of 1.3 nm. The tetra(ethylene glycol) chains were replaced with methyl
groups for clarity.

Our group has prepared
aromatic hydrazide oligomers and polymer
(P33) that bear amphiphilic short peptide chains which
could enhance the membrane-inserting ability.59,60 The polymer had an Mn of 15.8 KD, which
corresponded to the polymerization degree of about 10 and 3.5 helix
turns. Both oligomers and polymer were found to insert lipid bilayers
to form uni(macro)molecular channels (Figure 6). The polymer exhibited an NH4+/K+ selectivity that was higher than that
of gramicidin A as well as long open duration. Moreover, its different
components could generate a trace of multiple currents because of
their varying length.

Figure 6 Schematic presentation of the transmembrane channel formed
by helical
polymer P33.

Polymers P34a–c have Mn of 14.4, 12.2, and 7.2 KD and Mw of 31.2, 31.1, and 2.1 KD.61 The Mn values corresponded to 26, 24, and 14 aromatic
subunits and 4.3, 4.0, or 2.3 turns for the designed helical conformation.
The polymers were soluble in water because of the attachment of hydrophilic
oligo(ethylene glycol). Their repeated benzene rings bear three, two,
or one chiral centers. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds formed by
one of the repeated two isophthalamide units had been demonstrated
to favor the formation of helical conformations.27 In polar organic solvents such as methanol or acetonitrile,
all the polymers folded into helical conformations, which, however,
did not exhibit helicity bias. In more polar water, helicity bias
was displayed, as evidenced by the formation of induced CD signals.
This helicity bias was comparable for P34a and P34b, indicating that their chiral side chains on the 5-position
of one of the repeated two benzene rings did not considerably contribute
to the helicity induction.

Meijer et al. also prepared polymers P35a–c from the corresponding diamines and diisocyanic
acids that bore
chiral side chains.62 Stable intramolecular
six-membered C=O···H–N hydrogen bonding
and the rigidity of the aromatic urea units enabled helical conformations
for this kind of polymers that had a cavity of 1.4 nm. Crude polymer P35a had been separated by GPC into high, intermediate, and
low Mw fractions. In THF, only the high Mw fraction (n = ∼30)
folded into a stable chiral helical conformation, which was consistent
with the formation of a deep tubular structure (ca. 5 turns). Polymer P35b, with a DP of about 20, could form chiral helical conformation
in water.63 The intramolecular hydrogen
bonding should be weaker because of the competition of water molecules.
Thus, cross-turn intramolecular π–π stacking would
make important contribution for the formation of the helical conformation.
The large oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPC) chromophores
of polymer P35c was found to enhance backbone stacking.64 CD studies of the long-chain fraction of P35c revealed induced Cotton effect for the OPV chromatophores
in THF but not in chloroform, again showing that π–π
stacking played a key role in the formation of the helical conformation
in a more polar medium.

3.3 Poly(aromatic triazole
and oxadiazole) Backbones
Hecht and Meudtner prepared polymers P36a and P36b that consisted of alternating pyridine-triazole-benzene-triazole
units.65 It was found that the triazole-pyridine
segments adopted an anti–anti configuration because of electrostatic
repulsion of their nitrogen atoms,66 which
led both polymers to form a helical conformation even in the absence
of anionic templates, although the rotation of the benzene-connected
C–N bonds was not controlled. Moreover, the chiral side chains
could induce helicity bias. Even though no molecular weights were
given, both polymers should be obviously longer than previously developed
oligomeric analogues.66 Thus, π–π
stacking should also be an important stabilizing factor for the helical
conformations.

Klumperman et al. prepared polymers P37 and P38,67 which were found
to exist as random coils in DMF. In more polar binary DMF and water
(9:1, v/v), S- and R-P37 formed helical conformations with helicity bias becasuse of the
induction of the chiral side chains. Molecular modeling showed that
the helical conformation had 14.5 repeat units per turn. Thus, the
helices possessed a very large cavity of approximately 30.6 Å
in diameter (Figure 7). With the increase of the water content, the helices stayed intact
but also further aggregated into tertiary nanotubes. Adding rigid
and hydrophobic poly(γ-benzyl-l-glutamate) (PBLG) α-helix,
which has a diameter of about 1.6 nm, to the solution of P38 caused the polymer to undergo coil-to-helix transition through threading
into the helical cavity of the polymer. Again, this threaded helix
exhibited helicity bias because of the chirality induction of PBLG.

Figure 7 Calculated

a large cavity diameter.

Dong and Liu and co-workers prepared polymers P39a and S- and R-P40 which
consisted of alternating 1,3,4-oxadiazole and pyrido[3,2-g]quinolone segments.68P39a had a molecular weight of up to 12000, which was evidenced by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry, and DP of up to 30. Its Mn and PDI were evaluated to be 6000 and 1.16, respectively.
Scanning tunneling microscopy images confirmed that all of the polymers
formed helical structures, with the diameter being only ca. 0.55 nm,
and S- and R-P40 exhibited
helicity bias in dichloromethane. Moreover, the helical structures
could further bind to form double helices, which had been observed
before only for heterocyclic amide-derived backbones.28,29 The same group further prepared polymers P39b and P39c, which were more soluble in organic solvents because
of the introduction of longer n-dodecyl chains.69P39b had Mn of 18700 and PDI of 1.21. Again, both polymers were found
to form helical conformations in organic solvents. Molecular modeling
predicted that this series of backbones had the helical pitch of 0.36
nm and 3.2 units per turn. Thus, the helix of P39b was
estimated to have a depth of ca. 3.3 nm. P39b was revealed
to insert into lipid bilayers to form unimacromolecular channels,
which could mediate the transport of protons and cations. The shorter P39c also could form transmembrane channels but worked through
a dimeric tubular structure. Mechanism studies supported that both
channels transported ions through the interior of the helices.

4 Macromolecular Backbones Formed Through End-to-End
Dynamic Covalent Bonding and Coordination
Partial replacement
of the ethynyl linkers of the oligo- or poly(meta-phenylene
ethynylene) backbones with imine units does not break the tendency
of the backbones to stack into helical conformations. However, the
dynamic nature of the imine bond allows for the study for the equilibrium
distribution of different imine-derived backbones when multiple amine
and aldehyde precursors are used as precursors for building the helical
backbones. To test this, Moore and co-workers prepared oligomers 41 and 42 to study their imine metathesis, which
would result in the formation of polymers of different lengths.70,71 It was found that in benign solvents such as chloroform, equilibrium
constants for different polymer products was close to unity. However,
in polar media like acetonitrile, long polymer products could fold
into more stable helical conformations through stacking-promoted nucleation,
which caused the shifting of the equilibrium to longer, high-molecular
weight products. Through this imine metathesis, long polymeric helical
tubes can be produced under mild reaction conditions. The melt condensation
of the corresponding diamine and dialdehyde only gave rise to polymers
of low molecular weights,71 indicating
that no stacking-promoted nucleation event took place.

Moore and Wackerly also prepared short dipyridines 43a–c which themselves adopted flexible conformations.72 In acetonitrile, their pyridines could be coordinated to
Pd2+. The coordination of hexamer 43b gave
rise to a 1 + 1 macrocycle which could aggregate into columnar tubes.
In contrast, for 43a and 43c, this binding
led to the formation of new coordination polymers that could fold
into helical conformations (Figure 8). As expected, a paralinked control oligomer only
exhibited simple isodesmic step-growth polymerization. The introduction
of imine bonds or Pd2+ ions should cause just a small deformation
of the resulting helical tubes. Thus, these dynamic supramolecular
tubular structures are also potentially useful hosts for studying
molecular recognition for linear guests.

Figure 8 Pyridine-Pd2+ binding of 43a–c forms
metal–ligand complexes to generate coordination supramolecular
helical polymer or π-stacked columnar polymer.

Dong and Liu and co-workers prepared polymer P44a through
the condensation of the corresponding dialdehyde and diacylhydrazine
precursors.73 Its Mn and PDI were estimated by GPC to be 31 KD and 1.46, respectively.
The intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the pyrido[3,2-g]quinoline
and the hydrazone units, together with the electrostatic repulsion
between the imine and connected pyridine nitrogen atoms, forced the
backbone to produce a tubular helix of approximately 1.0 cavity diameter
in dichloromethane. Interestingly, the tubular helix could catalyze
the oxidation of benzenethiol into diphenyldisulfide in the presence
of hydrogen peroxide through the polar microenvironment inside the
tube. The aldehyde units at the end of the backbone could be converted
into imine units by treating with amines. When chiral 1-phenylethan-1-amines
were used, the resulting polymers P44b and P44c exhibited induced CD signals, indicating the formation of chiral
helical tubes.

5 Macromolecular Backbones Formed Through End-to-End
Hydrogen Bonding
Although a large number of aromatic amide-derived
oligomers and
polymers have been developed to form tubular structures, the stacking
of the tubular structures into long one-dimensional (1D) supramolecular
structures has been a challenge. Orthogonal end-to-end noncovalent
interactions would help to promote such 1D stacking. However there
have not yet efficient approaches to realize this in solution.

Zeng and Huo developed a “sticky” strategy for short
pyridine amide-based helices to form column-like aggregates in the
solid state through end-to-end hydrogen bonding, which may be N–H···O
or N–H···O motif.74 For example, compound 45 formed such 1D tubes which
entrapped methanol in the cavity (Figure 9).75 Water or
dichloromethane molecules might also be entrapped in the cavity, depending
on the conditions for growing the single crystals. For example, pentamer 46 afforded similar 1D supramolecular tubes which hosted a
hydrogen-bonded water line (Figure 10).76 Tetramers generally
could not form such column-like structures because they cannot produce
a full helical turn. One hexamer of the same sequence was also found
to be unable to produce stacking columns. Moreover, many pentamers
that bear different end groups and/or side chains did not stack in
a similar way. Clearly, the formation of such end-to-end intermolecular
hydrogen bonding needs, among others, subtle balance of the length
of the backbones, the size and electronic nature of substituents at
different positions, and the steric effect of different segments.

structures of 45·MeOH. The neighboring
helices were linked through end-to-end C=O···H–C(Bn)
hydrogen bonding to produce column-like tube that hosted methanol
molecules.

complementary end atoms
each containing two H atoms in gray and one O atom in red that participate
in forming two weak intermolecular H-bonds of C=O···H–C
type. These H-bonds help to create (c) 1D chiral helical stacks consisting
of helices of the same handedness and (d) chiral aquapores of ∼2.8
Å across for accommodating (e) H-bonded 1D water chains.

6 Conclusion and Outlook
In this perspective paper, we have summarized the advance of using
helical molecules or macromolecules to build tubular structures. The
tubes may be formed by one or multiple molecules which are connected
by dynamic covalent bonding, coordination, and intermolecular hydrogen
bonding. The cavity size and depth of yet reported (macro)molecular
tubes can be tuned from less than 1 nm to several nm. Currently, their
functions have been investigated mainly in the category of molecular
recognition. Moreover, examples of transmembrane transport and catalysis
or reaction promotion have also been reported. We believe that further
exploration of new structures for the development of new properties
or functions will be crucially important in the future. As for the
development of new structures, systems with a very large cavity size
should be attractive for the design of unimolecular tubes, which would
allow for the introduction of functional groups in the cavity for
exploiting new functions such as catalysis. Up to now, many polymeric
tubes have been reported. However, efficient methods for the preparation
of very long polymeric backbones are still not available. As a result,
the length of the macromolecular tubes reported yet is still limited.
For the purpose of increasing the DP, it is necessary to find the
ways to overcome the increasing stacking-initiated steric hindrance
during the polymerization.77 Extension
of large tubular helices, particularly those driven by hydrogen bonding,
is expected to produce tremendous deformation and impose great stress.78 Suitable operation of this process may be utilized
to modulate the mechanic property of new smart materials.
