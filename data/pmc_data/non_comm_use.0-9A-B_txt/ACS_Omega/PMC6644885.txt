Layered
oxides are promising cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries
because of their high theoretical capacities. However, many of these
layered materials experience severe capacity decay when operated at
high voltage (>4.25 V), hindering their practical application.
It
is essential to design high-voltage layered cathodes with improved
stability for high-energy-density operation. Herein, nano P2-Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) materials are synthesized using a modified Pechini
method as a prospective high-voltage sodium storage component without
any modification. The changes in the local ionic state around Ni,
Mn, and Co ions with respect to the calcination temperature are recorded
using X-ray absorption fine structure analysis. Among the electrodes,
NCM fired at 850 °C (NCM-850) exhibits excellent electrochemical
properties with an initial capacity and energy density of 148 mAh
g–1 and 555 Wh kg–1, respectively,
when cycled between 2 and 4.5 V at 160 mA g–1 along
with improved cyclic stability after 100 charge/discharge cycles.
In addition, the NCM-850 electrode is capable of maintaining a 75
mAh g–1 capacity even at a current density of 3200
mA g–1. In contrast, the cell fabricated with NCM
obtained at 800 °C shows continuous capacity fading because of
the formation of an impurity phase during the synthesis process. The
obtained capacity, rate performance, and energy density along with
prolonged cyclic life for the cell fabricated with the NCM-850 electrodes
are some of the best reported values for sodium-ion batteries as compared
to those of other p2-type sodium intercalating materials.

Introduction
Energy storage devices
for large-scale applications require power
packs fabricated with environmentally friendly raw materials.1 When taking into consideration the benefits of
sodium such as low cost, natural abundance, and low toxicity, sodium-ion
batteries (SIBs) can serve as an excellent alternative to lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs), which contain toxic and expensive materials.1,2 In recent times, several materials have been identified as potential
candidates for application in SIBs.3−7 Among them, layered oxides with different structural types (O3 or
P2 types) show high electrochemical activity and are capable of delivering
high-rate performance.8 Since P2-type materials
exhibit high sodium-ion diffusion rates and low phase changes during
the charge/discharge process as compared to those of O3-type materials,
intensive research has been conducted to develop high-performance
P2-type layered materials.8−16

Although parent P2-type layered NaMO2 (M = Fe,
Co, Ni,
Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) has already been studied extensively for decades
and exhibited reasonable Na-ion intercalation/deintercalation properties,
toxicity and inherent electrical conductivity of these materials resulted
in poor cycling performance at high current rates.7,14,17 Hence, constructing layered materials with
multitransition metal oxides has been demonstrated to improve the
electrochemical performance of parent NaMO2.3,4,9,11,12 Numerous multitransition materials have
been adopted as energy-storage hosts for SIB applications.2−4,8−12,15,16,18−27 All of the aforementioned electrodes had showed stable cyclic behavior
at a lower cutoff voltage; however, these materials have shown poor-rate
performances even at a low cutoff voltage.3,8,9,11,16,19−27 In contrast, P2-type layered materials possess large capacity fading
at high-voltage cycling.28 This capacity
fading is attributed to the irreversible phase transition and dissolution
of active species into the electrolyte, restricting the complete utilization
of cathode materials for energy storage reactions.8−10 Very few studies
on the charge/discharge performance of P2-type layered materials at
high cutoff voltage over 4.4 V have been conducted.8−10,28 None of these reports display stable performance
at high-voltage cycling. Of late, Wang et al. studied the cyclic performance
of P2-Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2, which yielded a capacity of ∼140 mAh g–1 at 0.1 C rate when cycled between 2.0 and 4.5 V along with capacity
retention of 29% after 100 cycles.28 Lu
et al. achieved a discharge capacity of 161 mAh g–1 for P2-Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 at a very low current rate of C/85 within the 2–4.5 V cycling
range.8 Guo et al. prepared P2- and O3-type
composite electrodes as high-performance electrode materials for SIBs
within a potential range of 4.5–1.5 V. Despite delivering a
discharge capacity of ∼190 mAh g–1, they
exhibited low-rate performance.26 It was
proposed that doping of other transition metals such as Ti, Mg, Zn,
and Al into the structure could improve the structural stability of
sodium-based P2-type cathodes.10,16,18,29 Nevertheless, such compounds
have shown poor-rate performance, which is one of the prerequisite
for large-scale energy storage devices.

Recently, it was reported
that the design of cathode materials
with off-stoichiometry could deliver better structural and cycling
behavior than that with their stoichiometric counterparts.30,31 By keeping this concept in mind, we synthesize P2-type Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) as high-performance cathode materials for SIB applications.
In our previous work, we succeeded in developing NCM by the sol–gel
method with excellent electrochemical stability by tailoring the surface
of NCM through atomic layer deposition.30 However, the sol–gel-based NCM displayed a low capacity value
(120 mAh g–1 at 1 C rate) as well as poor electrochemical
rate performance.32 Generally, the low
electrochemical rate capability of the P2-type cathode results from
its poor morphological and structural properties.9,11,12,23 It is well
known that morphological factors such as particle size and distribution
have great impacts on enhancing electrochemical storage behavior.30,31 Nevertheless, the synthesis of nanoscale sodium-based layered materials
with even size distribution is scarce because of particle agglomeration
at high-temperature calcination. Recently, the modified Pechini method
(PM) has been widely utilized to synthesize oxide nanocrystals.33 The method involves an intensive blending of
positive ions in a solution and controlled transformation of the mixed
metal solution into a polymer gel. This is followed by the removal
of the polymer matrix at a desired temperature for the development
of an oxide precursor with a high degree of homogeneity.33 In addition, the coupling of the polymer and
nanoparticle during the synthesis has great advantages over the conventional
sol–gel method. The polymeric materials can tailor the nanoparticle
surface to enhance the contact between the particles, which assists
in enhancing the electrochemical sodium storage performances.33

In this study, we have made a novel attempt
to design nanostructured
NCM with enhanced electrochemical performance using PM (Scheme 1). Because the Na-ion diffusion
in micrometric materials larger than 1 μm has very low rate
capability, the utilization of nano-NCM reduces the ion migration
path, thereby increasing the ability to storing more ions within the
structure.10,16,23,29−31 In this article, high-performance
nano-NCM with high energy density is prepared and studied for its
Na-ion storage ability within 2–4.5 V at various current rates
ranging from 0.16 to 3200 mA g–1 (1 C = 160 mA g–1). Moreover, the impact of temperature on the structural
and electrochemical performance of nano-NCM is simultaneously studied
using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and charge/discharge
studies, respectively, and discussed in detail.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Nano-NCM
Using PM
Preparation of Nano-NCM
Powders
Nano-NCM powders were
prepared using a PM in which appropriate amounts of metal acetates
are dissolved in 50 mL of distilled water in one beaker. In another
beaker, 2.5 g of poly(ethylene glycol) (nonionic surfactant) and 5.72
g of citric acid are dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol. Then, the two
solutions are mixed together and stirred at 110 °C to encourage
the esterification reaction. Ethylene glycol (2 mL) and concentrated
nitric acid (2 mL, 68–70%) were slowly added into the above
solution during the esterification process. It can be seen that the
solution quickly turns clear pink during mixing. After evaporating
excess water and ethanol, the resultant precursor is decomposed at
400 °C for 4 h to remove organic moieties. Finally, the black
powders obtained are calcined at different temperatures ranging from
800 to 900 °C for 12 h in air. The nano-NCM powders obtained
at 800, 850, and 900 °C are labeled as NCM-800, NCM-850, and
NCM-900, respectively.

The structural characterization of NCM
nanomaterials was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu Kα
radiation using a Bruker D8 Discover Diffractometer. The morphological
features such as particle size and distribution are observed by field
emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800) coupled
with energy-dispersive spectroscopy. The influence of temperatures
on structural integrity was investigated using X-ray adsorption fine
structure (XAFS) measurement at the Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan, Canada. XAFS measurements are taken using a 06ID superconducting
wiggler sourced hard X-ray microanalysis beamline with a premirror–double
crystal monochromator–postmirror configuration by Si(111) crystals
and Rh mirrors. The monoenergy calibration has been done using Co,
Ni, and Mn foils at their corresponding edges. The beamline current
and wiggler were running at 250 mA and 1.9 T, respectively. All of
the XAFS measurements are taken at room temperature in transmission
and fluorescence modes using a 32-element Ge detector.

The cathodes
with desired size are punched out from the slurry
containing 70% active material (nano-NCMs), 20% acetylene black, and
10% poly(vinylidene fluoride) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
coated on Al foil. The cells for electrochemical testing are constructed
in an argon-filled glove box using CR2032 configuration. The cells
are fabricated by sandwiching a slurry-coated cathode, a polypropylene
separator (Celgard 2400), and a Na-foil anode. NaClO4 (1
M) dissolved in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (1:1, v/v)
is used as the electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Nyquist
plots are recorded in an electrochemical analyzer (Biologic SP-150,
France). The charge/discharge measurements are conducted in an Arbin
BT-2000 Battery Test System between 2 and 4.5 V at different current
densities ranging from 16 to 3200 mA g–1 (1 C =
160 mA g–1).

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the XRD patterns of nano-NCM powders prepared using the PM at different
calcination temperatures. All diffraction peaks can be assigned to
the hexagonal structure with a P63/mmc space group (JCPDS PDF No: 194).11,12,23 Small, unindexed peaks associated with spinel
NiMn2O4 impurity (PDF 01-1110) could be observed
between 2θ = 35 and 38° in the XRD pattern of the NCM-800
sample.34 However, the impurity phases
are gradually suppressed as the calcination temperature is increased.35,36 The suppression of impurity phase with the increasing temperature
also concludes that the mixed phase turns into the hexagonal layered
rock-salt phase.30 In addition, lattice
parameters (ah and ch) are also increased with the increasing calcination temperature,
as shown in Table 1, which is an ideal indication of increasing structural integrity
and particle size of the nano-NCM material with respect to the firing
temperature. Because the lattice content is strongly related to the
atomic distribution, differences in lattice content reveal that the
samples are synthesized with different structural integrity.31 The integrated intensity ratio I(002)/I(104) is an identification
of cation mixing between the transition metal oxide and alkali metal
sites.13 The I(002)/I(104) ratios for NCM-800, NCM-850,
and NCM-900 are calculated as 3.41, 4.03, and 1.60, respectively.
Higher ratios suggest that there is low cation mixing between the
sites.13 Among the samples synthesized,
NCM-900 materials show a lower I(002)/I(104) intensity ratio, implying high cation
mixing in the NCM-900 sample and hence poor electrochemical performance
could be expected from the NCM-900 sample. It is believed that fractional
cation mixing and highly crystalline nature of cathode materials are
essential characters for exhibiting good electrochemical cycling performance
and structural stability during cycling.13,30,31 The Rietveld refinement patterns of samples
are presented in Figure S1, and their crystallographic
data are listed in Table S1. As seen in Figure S1, the difference between experimental
and calculated patterns is very small. Moreover, the low reliability
factor values in Table S1 (Rwp and Rp) demonstrate a successful
refinement.

The morphologies of the NCM samples are presented
in Figure 1. All particles
are appearing
to consist of aggregates of sub-micrometer-sized particles with different
morphologies. As expected, the particle size and crystallinity are
increased with the increasing temperature. It can be observed from Figure 1 that the particle
sizes gradually increased from 150 to 650 nm with unchanged particle
shapes. However, particle sizes rapidly increased at 900 °C and
their shapes changed greatly, which may be due to the agglomeration
of particles during high-temperature calcination.10,13,19,31,37 In addition, the lattice and I(002)/I(104) intensity ratio parameters
are listed in Table 1, clearly showing some structural changes when the calcination temperature
reached 900 °C. It has been reported that electronic migration
and ionic migration are significantly influenced by the morphological
features of the cathode materials.10,17,22,28 Because the nanostructured
materials with uniform distribution can minimize the pathway for Na-ion
diffusion, enhanced Na-ion storage is expected for the NCM-850 sample.30,31 Although the cathode powder calcined at 900 °C displays the
best layered hexagonal structure and crystallinity as observed from
the XRD patterns, it is not the best material in terms of energy storage
capability, which will be discussed in the following sections. The
inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-atomic emission spectroscopy results
of NCM samples are presented in Table S2, implying that the experimental values are close to the calculated
values.

X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis
is used
to demonstrate the changes of the local ionic state around the Co,
Mn, and Ni atoms in nano-NCM powders calcined at various temperatures,
and the corresponding K edges together with Li(Ni0.33Mn0.33Co0.33)O2 (LNMC) standard compounds
are illustrated in Figure 2. All spectra display a pre-edge (denoted #) weak adsorption
peak, corresponding to the electronic excitation of the 1s core to
unoccupied 3d orbitals of the transition metal ions. This is also
ascribed to the orbital mixing between 3d and 4p, which results from
the uneven centrosymmetric nature of the distorted octahedral 3a site
in the rhombohedral R3m space group.38 Consequently, information about the site symmetry,
degree of distortion in the octahedra, and the oxidation state of
the core atoms could be attained from these pre-edge peaks.39,40 The main absorption peaks in Figure 2 (denoted *) are from dipole-allowed transitions of
1s core electrons to unoccupied 4p states without any shakedown processes.
As seen from Figure 2b, Co K edge spectra of all samples are unchanged and almost identical
to the Co3+ standard LNMC spectrum. This states that the
local ionic structure around the Co atom is unchanged greatly with
the calcination temperature and mostly exists in the +3 state.40 Similarly, the Mn K edge peak position of nano-NCM
powders in Figure 2a does not shift much and predominantly consists of Mn4+ ions.41,42 However, it can be seen that the pre-edge
intensity (inset in Figure 2b) slightly increased for the samples calcined at 900 °C,
signifying increased local structural distortion in the Mn–O6
octahedra for the NCM-900 sample.11,39

Figure 2 XANES of (a)
Mn K edge, (b) Co K edge, and (c) Ni K edge peaks
of NCM materials before the cycling process. The spectrums are compared
with standard LNMC spectrums.

In contrast to the Co and Mn K edge spectrums, the Ni K edge
spectra
of NCM-800 and NCM-900 powders show an obvious peak shift toward higher
energy, whereas the spectrum of NCM-850 does not exhibit any energy
shift compared with the standard spectrum. The shift in energy demonstrates
that the oxidation state of Ni in NCM-800 and NCM-900 electrode materials
is slightly increased at high temperatures.40,42 Moreover, an obvious increase in the pre-edge peak for the sample
calcined at 900 °C is observed, which results from increased
local structural distortion of the Ni–O6 octahedra because
of the increased amount of Jahn–Teller active Ni3+ ions. On the other hand, powders calcined at 850 °C have a
low pre-edge intensity and exhibit lower cation disordering among
other samples, as shown in Figure 2a–c. This outcome is correlated well with the
data obtained from XRD analysis. The XANES results reveal that the
sample prepared at 900 °C would deliver low discharge capacity
because of the higher initial oxidation state of Ni ions and high
structural disorder, which limit the use of the Ni2+/4+ redox couple during the charge/discharge process.39−42

To study the Na-ion storage
mechanism, CV studies of nano-NCM electrodes
have been carried out between 4.5 and 2 V at a 0.1 mV s–1 scan rate, and the curves are presented in Figure 3a. All CV curves display three redox peaks
at around 2.3, 3.6, and 4.3 V, which can be attributed to the oxidation/reduction
reaction of Mn3+/4+, Co3+/4+, and Ni2+/4+ couples, respectively.11,20 This confirms that
the valence states of Co, Ni, and Mn in NMC powders would be at +3,
+2, and +4, respectively, which will also be confirmed in charge/discharge
experiments.

V at 0.1
mV s–1 scan rate, (b) Nyquist plots of nano-NCM
electrodes measured at open circuit voltages, and (c) equivalent circuit
that was used to fit the Nyquist plots presented in (b).

Furthermore, half-cells fabricated with the NCM-850
electrode have
strong current response and capacity, whereas the NCM-900 electrode
shows poor electrochemical storage behavior. In addition, NCM-800
electrodes show a predominant peak shift during positive and negative
sweeps because of the polarization of the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple. Consequently, the NCM-900 electrode displays suppressed
peaks associated with the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox reaction,
as presented in Figure 3a. This restricts full participation of the Ni2+/Ni4+ redox couple in the electrochemical reaction, thereby decreasing
Na-ion storage capability, agreeing well with the XAFS studies.13 The superior electrochemical behavior of the
NCM-850 electrode originates from the small particle size with large
exposed reaction sites as well as negligible cation mixing during
the preparation process.30,31 On the other hand,
uniform distribution of NCM-850 particles increases the contact at
the particle–particle and the particle–current collector
interfaces and hence charge storage characteristics are improved.9,13,31,37

Figure 3b illustrates
the Nyquist plots of nano-NCM electrodes recorded between 200 kHz
and 10 mHz frequency range at open circuit voltage. The Nyquist plots
are fitted according to the equivalent circuit presented in Figure 3c, and the parameters
are listed in Table 2. As seen from Figure 3b, the Nyquist spectrum contains three predominant regions including
two semicircles and an inclined line. The semicircle in the high-
and intermediate-frequency regions is related to the Na-ion migration
resistance (Rsf) through the electrode–electrolyte
interfacial (EEI) film and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the EEI film, respectively. An inclined
line in the low-frequency region is related to the Na-ion diffusion
in the bulk of the electrode active material. It is clear that the
NCM-900 electrode has high Rsf compared
to that of other materials, which may be due to the change in the
interfacial structure that influences the properties of the EEI layer
such as thickness and density.30 Among
the electrodes, NCM-850 exhibits a lower Rct value of 406.05 Ω, as shown in Table 2. This is owing to its uniform morphological
feature, facilitating faster ionic migration. It is worth mentioning
here that the electrode with a lower Rct value would have exhibited excellent electrochemical performance.43 Because lowering the resistance directly increases
the current flow on the electrode surface, the diffusion rate of Na
ions toward the electrode is enhanced and thus improves the sluggish
kinetic behavior and increases the charge/discharge properties of
NCM-850 electrodes.30,43

The initial charge/discharge curves of nano-NCM electrodes
conducted
within the 2–4.5 V window at a current density of 160 mA g–1 are presented in Figure 4a. The curves show three redox plateaus during
the charge and discharge processes. The plateaus around ∼2.3,
3.6, and 4.2 V are ascribed to the redox reaction of Co3+/4+, Mn3+/4+, and Ni2+/4+ couples, correlating
well with CV results.12,15 It can be seen that irreversible
capacity losses of 75, 22, and 30 mAh g–1 could
be observed for the NCM-800, NCM-850, and NCM-900 electrodes, respectively.
This demonstrates the pre-existence of metal ions in the Na ion layer,
which leads to the formation of inactive regions during the first
charge/discharge process.13,26,31 However, the columbic efficiency of all cells reach more than 99%
after 100 cycles (Figure S2). As seen from Table 2, the NCM-900 electrode
delivers low capacity value of 88 mAh g–1 at 160
mA g–1 current density because of the large charge
transfer resistance, as listed in Table 2. On the other hand, NCM-800 and NCM-850
electrodes exhibit discharge capacities of 108 and 148 mA g–1 under the same testing conditions. The discharge capacity obtained
from the NCM-850 electrode is one of the highest reported values for
layered P2-type cathodes in SIBs, especially at high current values.11,12,15,16,21,23,26,39,40,44 The enhanced electrochemical
behavior of the NCM-850 electrode results from the uniformity of the
nanostructured material, which enables faster ionic movement and also
enhances the contact between the active materials, thereby improving
the capacity value.30,43

Figure 4 (a) Charge–discharge studies and
(b) cycle life of nano-NCM
materials at a current density of 160 mA g–1 within
2–4.5 V and (c) rate performance of the electrodes at different
current densities ranging from 16 to 3200 mA g–1 (1 C = 160 mAh g–1).

The cycling performance of Nano-NCM electrodes recorded at
160
mA g–1 is presented in Figure 4b. Although all electrodes show a linear
decrease in capacity value during the initial few cycles, the cyclic
performance becomes stable during subsequent cycles. This capacity
fading during initial cycles is mainly associated with small structural
distortion and/or side reactions during the charge/discharge process.13,26,31 It is clear from Figure 4b that the NCM-850 electrode
has enhanced cyclic stability along with high capacity compared to
those of other nano-NCM electrodes. It is apparent that the electrochemical
stability is irrevocably linked with the particle size and the degree
of agglomeration. Suryanarayana et al. reported that nanocrystalline
materials prepared with uniform grain size and distribution could
demonstrate enhanced ion diffusivity and higher thermal coefficients
than those of conventional materials.45 The cell fabricated with NCM-800 suffers from significant capacity
fading at 160 mA g–1, whereas the sample calcined
at 900 °C possesses much better cycle retention. The enhanced
electrochemical performance of the NCM-850 electrode even at high
cutoff operation can be assigned to its improved structural integrity
with low cation mixing.13,30 The difference in cycling
performance results from the cation mixing as well as from the degree
of crystallinity, as determined from the XRD and XANES studies. Although
the NCM-900 electrode delivers low capacity of 88 mAh g–1 at 160 mA g–1, it shows the highest capacity retention
rate. This is because of its well-developed layered structure and
highly crystalline nature, which assist in maintaining the structural
stability during charge/discharge studies.

Figure 4c shows
the rate performance of the cells at various current densities. The
NCM-850 electrode delivers excellent rate performance with the capacities
of 168, 145, 115, 95, and 66 mAh g–1 at 0.16, 160,
800, 1600, and 3200 mA g–1 current densities, respectively.
On the other hand, the NCM-800 and NCM-900 electrodes deliver only
about 25 and 14 mAh g–1 at 3200 mA g–1 current densities, respectively. In addition, when the current density
is reverting to 16 mA g–1, almost 95% of original
capacity is retained, as presented in Figure 4c. It is clear that the NCM-850 electrode
is capable of achieving more than twice the capacity values of the
other nano-NCM electrodes, especially at high current density. The
comparison of the discharge capacity of NCM-850 with that of various
P2 layered materials is presented in Figure S3. To the best of our knowledge, the electrochemical behaviors such
as cycling stability and rate performance at high cutoff voltage obtained
from nano-NCM in this study are the best among those reported thus
far for sodium-based P2-type intercalation electrodes.2−4,8−13,15,16,19,23,24,28,38,46−48 A maximum capacity
of ∼185 mAh g–1 at C/30 was obtained from
the layered NaNi0.5Mn0.5O2 electrode
along with 16% capacity retention after 20 cycles.49,38 P2-Na2/3[Ni1/3Mn2/3]O2 (1/3 < x < 2/3) material delivered 161 and
141 mAh g–1 at C/85 and C/30 C within 2–4.5
V and experienced large capacity fading after the cycling process.8,28 Interestingly, the capacity achieved for nano-NCM at high current
densities (75 mAh g–1 at 3200 mA g–1) in the present investigation has also outperformed the rate performance
of Al-, Ti-, Mg-, and Zn-doped P2-type layered cathode materials.
For instance, layered materials such as NaxMg0.11Mn0.89O2 (35 mAh g–1 at 610 mA g–1), Na0.67[Mn0.65Co0.2Ni0.15]O2 (65 mAh g–1 at 400 mA g–1), Na2/3Co2/3Mn2/9Ni1/9O2 (60 mAh g–1 at 252 mA g–1) Na0.45Ni0.22Co0.11Mn0.66O2 (59 mAh g–1 at 610 mA g–1), Na0.66Ni0.33–xZnxMn0.67O2 (55 mAh g–1 at 748 mA g–1), and Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/2Ti1/6O2 (93 mAh g–1 at 484 mA g–1) had exhibited lower rate performance compared to that in the present
investigation.9−11,15,16,50 In addition, the NCM-850 electrode
delivers an energy density of 555 Wh kg–1 (calculated
on the basis of an average voltage of 3.75 V), which is much higher
than by many other SIB cathode materials and also surpasses the energy
density of commercial lithium-ion battery cathodes like LiFePO4 (530 Wh kg–1) and LiMn2O4 (450 Wh kg–1).9,40,51,52,25

The outstanding electrochemical Na-ion storage
behavior of NCM-850
can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the highly crystalline
nature and structural integrity along with low cation disorder of
the NCM-850 material, which can facilitate the ionic and electronic
migration especially at high current densities; (ii) the nanoparticles
with preferred surface morphology enhance the availability of electrochemical
reaction sites and the contact between the particles and the particles/current
collector, improving the electrical conductivity and capacity; (iii)
evenly distributed particles also shorten the diffusion length for
Na-ion diffusion, stabilize the EEI layer, and enhance its stability;
and (vi) highly interconnected particles can accommodate more electrolyte
within its structure and eliminate the inherent mechanical stress
during the electrochemical process, thus improving the rate performance.
This justification is well agreed with the results obtained from the
charge/discharge and rate performance studies. These results clearly
demonstrated that the PM could significantly improve the electrochemical
reaction kinetics, energy density, and cyclic stability of the P2-NCM
cathode material for high-performance SIB applications.

Conclusions
Nanostructured Na2/3(Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13)O2 (NCM) electrode materials with improved
sodium-ion storage capability have been prepared by a modified Pechini
method. XAFS and XRD results reveal that the NCM material calcined
at high temperatures has high structural disorder as well as higher
Ni oxidation states, which results in poor electrochemical performance.
Of the samples tested, NCM prepared at 850 °C delivers the highest
capacity of 147 mAh g–1 along with a stable cyclic
performance at 160 mA g–1 in the 2–4.5 V
range. Although the material prepared at 900 °C exhibits a lower
capacity of 88 mAh g–1 at 160 mA g–1, it displays good capacity retention during charge/discharge studies
because of its superior structural integrity. We observed that the
P2 cathode fabricated through the modified Pechini method shows favorable
sodium-ion storage performance with much alleviated degradation.
