Small-molecule inhibitors
of HDACs (HDACi) induce hyperacetylation
of histone and nonhistone proteins and have emerged as potential therapeutic
agents in most animal models tested. The established HDACi vorinostat
and tubastatin-A alleviate neurodegenerative and behavioral conditions
in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders restoring the neurotrophic
milieu. In spite of the neuroactive pharmacological role of HDACi
(vorinostat and tubastatin-A), they are limited by efficacy and toxicity.
Considering these limitations and concern, we have designed novel
compounds 3–11 as potential HDACi
based on the strategic crafting of the key pharmacophoric elements
of vorinostat and tubastatin-A into architecting a single molecule.
The molecules 3–11 were synthesized
through a multistep reaction sequence starting from carbazole and
were fully characterized by NMR and mass spectral analysis. The novel
molecules 3–11 showed remarkable
pan HDAC inhibition and the potential to increase the levels of acetyl
H3 and acetyl tubulin. In addition, few novel HDAC inhibitors 4–8, 10, and 11 exhibited significant neurite outgrowth-promoting activity with
no observable cytotoxic effects, and interestingly, compound 5 has shown comparably more neurite growth than the parent
compounds vorinostat and tubastatin-A. Also, compound 5 was evaluated for possible mood-elevating effects in a chronic unpredictable
stress model of Zebrafish. It showed potent anxiolytic and antidepressant-like
effects in the novel tank test and social interaction test, respectively.
Furthermore, the potent in vitro and in vivo neuroactive compound 5 has shown selectivity for class II over class I HDACs. Our
results suggest that the novel carbazole-based HDAC inhibitors, crafted
with vorinostat and tubastatin-A pharmacophoric moieties, have potent
neurite outgrowth activity and potential to be developed as therapeutics
to treat depression and related psychiatric disorders.

Introduction
Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) are enzymes involved in the deacetylation
of histone and nonhistone proteins and are implicated in diseases
as diverse as cancer to the nervous system disorders.1 Interestingly, small-molecule inhibitors of HDACs (HDACi)
have shown therapeutic effects in preclinical models as well as in
clinical observations;2 the HDACi vorinostat
(SAHA, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) and romidepsin (depsipeptide)
have been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.3 In addition to their robust anticancer activity,
HDACi is involved in diverse in vitro neuroactive functions such as
neuroprotection,4−7 neurogenesis,8−11 neurite growth,12−14 and in amelioration of conditions in rodent models
of psychiatric and neurological disorders.15−17 However, many
of these HDACi have failed at various levels of preclinical and clinical
trials for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, mostly limited
by efficacy and nonspecific toxicity.1 This
necessitates the design and development of novel HDAC inhibitors or
modulators with the intention of overcoming these limitations, which
ultimately would lead to potential therapeutics for treating diverse
neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Vorinostat is a highly
effective pan class I and class II HDAC
inhibitor18,19 (Figure 1). Mounting evidence shows vorinostat as a potent anticancer
agent for monotherapy and also in combination with other agents in
treating hematological and solid tumors.3,18,20 Interestingly, it has been in the clinic for treating
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In addition, vorinostat crosses the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) and shows remarkable therapeutic effects in animal models
of various neurological21,22 and psychiatric disorders,23,24 but with nontargeted side effects.25 Tubastatin-A,
a selective HDAC6 inhibitor, has been shown to provide neuroprotection
in homocysteine-induced in vitro stress model.26 It has also demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in rodent
models of cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders.27−30 In addition, tubastatin-A shows minimal toxic effects, unlike other
HDACi, including vorinostat. However, its low BBB permeability and
sparse distribution in brain parenchyma limit its potential to become
a central nervous system (CNS) therapeutic (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of the FDA-approved drug vorinostat
and tubastatin-A
as HDAC inhibitors.

Considering the individual
therapeutic benefits of HDACi vorinostat
and tubastatin-A, and limitations in their use for developing a drug
for the treatment of diverse neurological and psychiatric disorders,
in particular depression, anxiety, and related mood disorders, we
embarked upon the development of a novel HDACi. Here, we have crafted
novel small molecules based on the hybridization of key pharmacophoric
features of vorinostat and tubastatin-A, to get new molecules that
would effectively inhibit the HDAC activity with potential in vitro
and in vivo neuroactive properties and low toxicity, unlike the vorinostat.
These active novel molecules were further screened in Zebrafish stress-induced
anxiety and depression model for assessing their antidepressant and
anxiolytic activities.

Results and Discussion
Design Strategy
In general, HDAC inhibitors consist
of zinc-binding bidentate functional group (e.g., hydroxamic acid)
and an alkyl chain or aromatic group as a linker and a cap group.
It is evident from the literature that “cap group” plays
a crucial role in selective inhibition of various HDAC isoforms. One
such selective HDAC6 inhibitor reported was tubastatin-A. Its selectivity
for HDAC6 could be due to a slightly wider carboline group in the
“cap” region. We, therefore, envisaged that carbazole
with a similar tricyclic architecture like carboline core could be
a choice for the “cap group” for an investigative purpose.
Further merging of carbazole unit derived from tubastatin-A with the
pharmacophoric features of vorinostat could give envisaged diverse
analogues 3–11 for their biological
evaluation. Schematic representation of the design strategy for the
generation of new molecules is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Schematic representation for design of new molecular
entities 3–11.

The first set of designer molecules 3 and 4 (Figure 3) have a
carbazole cap with N-benzyl group (a pharmacophoric
feature similar to tubastatin-A) and an alkyl linker with hydroxamic
acid (a pharmacophoric feature similar to vorinostat). Molecule 5 is crafted by replacing aniline cap of vorinostat with carbazole,
linking through C–C bond retaining all other pharmacophoric
features (alkyl chain and hydroxamic acid). Molecules 6 and 7 (Figure 3) have an additional oxime group in the cap region. Designer
molecules 8 and 9 are analogues of 3 with additional hydroxamic acid replacing benzyl group,
and 10 and 11 are N-alkylhydroxamic
acid derivatives of carbazole. These designer molecules were varied
in such a way as to obtain chemical entities to effectively inhibit
HDAC activity for potential use in the investigation for neuroactive
functions.

Chemistry
Initiating synthesis, the required key starting
compounds 9-benzyl-9H-carbazole (12),
ethyl 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)acetate, (13) and 9-tosyl-9H-carbazole (14) were
prepared by reacting carbazole with benzyl bromide, ethyl bromoacetate,
or p-toluenensulfonyl chloride in the presence of
a base (Scheme 1),
using literature procedures. The products 12–14 were characterized by NMR and mass spectra analyses and were correlated
with reported data.31

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Carbazole
Derivatives 12–14
Having 9-benzyl-9H-carbazole (12)
in hand, it was treated with anhydrides (gluteric, adipic, and suberic)
in the presence of AlCl3 under Friedel–Crafts acylation
conditions to form keto acids (15–17) in good yields (Scheme 2). The keto group was further reduced using Wolff–Kishner
reduction conditions (hydrazine hydride in the presence of KOH) to
give reduced acid compounds 18 and 19. Esterification
of acids with thionyl chloride in methanol followed by condensation
with hydroxylamine hydrochloride resulted in 5-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxypentanamide (3) and 6-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxyhexanamide (4) in 92 and 89% yields,
respectively. Similarly, 9-tosyl-9H-carbazole (14) gave 8-(9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxyoctanamide 5 in 90% yield (Scheme 3). Keto acids 16 and 17 were esterified with methanol in the presence
of thionyl chloride and then reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride
in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form 6-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxy-6-(hydroxyimino) hexanamide
(6) and 8-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxy-8-(hydroxyimino)octanamide (7) in
excellent yields (Scheme 4). All of the new compounds 3–7 were fully characterized by their NMR and mass spectral analyses.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of New Molecules 6 and 7
Ethyl 9H-carbazole-9-carboxylate
(13) was treated with gluteric anhydride in the presence
of aluminum
chloride to give 5-(9-(2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-5-oxopentanoic
acid (27). Esterification with methanol in the presence
of thionyl chloride gave methyl 5-(9-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-5-oxopentanoate (28). Diester 28 was reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence
of sodium hydride to produce trihydroxamide, N-hydroxy-5-(9-(2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-5-(hydroxyimino)pentanamide (9) in 89% yield. Wolff–Kishner reduction of 27 gave 5-(9-(carboxymethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pentanoic
acid (29). Esterification of diacid to form methyl 5-(9-(2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pentanoate (30), followed by
derivatization with hydroxylamine amine hydrochloride in presence
of sodium hydroxide, gave N-hydroxy-5-(9-(2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethyl)-9H-carbazol-3-yl)pentanamide (8) in 82% yield
(Scheme 5). Friedel–Crafts
acylation of carbazole with glutaric anhydride in the presence of
aluminum trichloride resulted 5-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-5-oxopentanoic
acid (31) in 65% yield. Methyl 5-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-5-oxopentanoate (33), obtained after
esterification of 31, was reacted with hydroxylamine
hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide to give 5-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-N-hydroxy-5-(hydroxyimino)pentanamide
(10) in 90% yield. Similarly, 6-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-N-hydroxy-6-(hydroxyimino)hexanamide (11) was
also synthesized from carbazole in very good yield (Scheme 6). All of the new products 8–11 were fully characterized by their
NMR and mass spectral analyses. The purity of all final products 3–11 was determined to be >97% by analytical
HPLC analysis.

Biology
HDACi vorinostat, tubastatin-A, and inspired
derivatives 3–11 were screened for
pan HDAC inhibition activity. Interestingly, these novel small molecules
have shown potent pan HDAC inhibition (IC50 0.6–1.2
μM) similarly to vorinostat (IC50 0.8 μM) and
tubastatin-A (IC50 1.32 μM) (Figure 4).

Figure 4 IC50 values of novel HDACi (7, 6, 3, 4, 9, 5, 8, 10, and 11), vorinostat, and
tubastatin-A. All of the novel small molecules have shown potent pan
HDAC inhibition (IC50 # 0.6–1.2 μM) similarly
to vorinostat (0.8 μM) and tubastatin-A (1.32 μM).

Furthermore, we validated the effect of novel small
molecules 3–11 on acetyl H3 and acetyl
tubulin levels,
as HDACi are involved in diverse cellular functions by inhibiting
HDACs and inducing hyperacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins.32,33 All of the novel compounds (3–11) at 10 μM concentration showed increased levels of acetyl
H3 and acetyl tubulin levels in GL-261 cells; similar changes were
observed in vorinostat- and tubastatin-A-treated cells (Figure 5A–C). These results
support the finding that novel compounds 3–11 induce HDAC inhibitory activity and associated downstream
changes, i.e., increased levels of acetyl H3 and acetyl tubulin.

densitometry values of acetyl H3/β-actin ratio (B) and acetyl
tubulin/tubulin ratio (C); *p < 0.05 (one-way
ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software) compared to no inhibitor treatment.

Interestingly, HDACi has been widely reported for
diverse in vitro
neuroactive functions (neurite outgrowth-promoting activity, neural
differentiation, and neuroprotection).34−39 Thus, all of the novel HDACi were screened for the neurite outgrowth
activity in differentiated Neuro2A cells. Compounds 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11, as well as vorinostat and tubastatin-A,
have shown significantly more neurite outgrowth promotion compared
to no inhibitor (Vehicle) treatment group (Figure 6). Interestingly, evaluation of optimum neuritogenic
concentrations revealed that compound 5 showed remarkably
more neurite outgrowth than vorinostat and tubastatin-A treatments
(Figures 6 and 7A,B). However, above the optimum neuritogenic concentration,
novel small molecules (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11) and standard HDACi (vorinostat, tubastatin-A) have shown reduced
neurite growth activity and viability. The potent neurite outgrowth
activity of compound 5 compared to vorinostat and tubastatin-A,
despite a similar level of pan HDAC inhibition and acetyl H3 and acetyl
tubulin induction levels, led us to anticipate possible HDAC selectivity
in compound 5.

μM)) at optimized concentrations. **p <
0.01, ***p < 0.001 (one-way ANOVA using GraphPad
Prism software) compared to no inhibitor (vehicle)-treated cells.

In addition, the potent neuritogenic compound 5 was
assessed for its effect on cell viability (cytotoxicity). Compound 5 and the parent entities, i.e., vorinostat and tubastatin-A,
were studied at different concentrations (10, 1.0, and 0.1 μM)
on Neuro2A cell line for cell viability using MTT assay. Compound 5 (10 μM) does not show any observable toxicity unlike
vorinostat-treated cells (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Bar graph shows the percentage of viable Neuro2A cells
after 72
h incubation with novel HDAC inhibitor (5), V (vorinostat),
and T (tubastatin-A) at 10, 1, and 0.1 μM concentrations (assessed
by MTT assay). *p < 0.05 (Student’s t-test).

The dose (1 μM)
at which compound 5 showed potent
neuritogenic activity was used to check its effect on the levels of
acetylation of histones H3, H4, and tubulin in Neuro2A cells. Compound 5 could induce a significant increase in acetylated H3 (Figure 9A,B), acetylated
H4 (Figure 9A,C), and
acetylated tubulin (Figure 9A,D) in Neuro2A cells compared to vehicle treatment.

In light of the remarkable neuritogenic activity
of novel HDACi
compound 5, compared to vorinostat and tubastatin-A,
and correlative evidence of the mood-elevating role of classic neurotrophic
HDAC inhibitors,40−42 we investigated the anxiolytic (in novel tank test)
and antidepressant effects (in social interaction test) of compound 5 in Zebrafish chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model43 (Figure S72 A–D, S73 A–C). First of all, it was imperative to test whether
the compound crosses the BBB. The intraperitoneal injection of the
compound resulted in its crossing the BBB, as evident from the results
shown in Figure S74. We also had obtained
the prediction results for its possibility to cross the BBB, using
in silico method, as shown in Figure S75.

In the novel tank test, our novel HDAC inhibitor compound 5 at doses 10 mg and 25 mg/kg showed significantly lower latency
to upper zone in comparison to the vehicle-treated group, and a similar
trend was observed in the fluoxetine (standard antidepressant used
as positive control)44,45-treated group (p-value < 0.05) (Figure 10A). In addition, compound 5 also induced an increase
in time spent in the top zone (Figure 10B) and in the number of crosses (Figure 10C) compared to
the vehicle-treated group (p-value < 0.05), with
a trend of decreased freezing duration (Figure 10D). Fluoxetine also induced an increase
in time spent in the top zone and in the number of crosses. The fluoxetine-treated
group also showed a trend in reduced freezing behavior (Figure 10B–D).

and 50 mg/kg)- and fluoxetine (15 mg/kg)-induced behavioral changes

Compound 5 was assessed at different
doses (10, 25,
and 50 mg/kg) for its antidepressant efficacy using the social interaction
test. The compound-induced changes in latency to social interaction,
total time spent in interaction zone, and freezing behavior were recorded.
Like fluoxetine, compound 5 at 10 and 25 mg, but not
at 50 mg dose, has shown remarkably less latency in interaction and
more time spent in the interaction zone compared to the vehicle-treated
group (p-value < 0.05) (Figure 11A,B). Furthermore, compound 5-treated animals have shown a trend of decreased freezing duration
(change is not significant), similar to that observed in the fluoxetine-treated
group (Figure 1).

Further, the potent in vitro and in vivo neuroactive compound 5 was used to study the HDAC (Class I, Class IIa, and Class
IIb) selectivity studies. The results show compound 5 selectivity for class II (class IIa-HDAC4 and class IIb- HDAC6)
over class I (HDAC8). Thus, the neuroactive and class II selective
compound 5 scaffold can be used for developing more selective
and efficient neuroactive HDAC inhibitors (Figure 12).

I), HDAC4 (class IIa), and HDAC6 (class IIb) enzymes with different
concentrations of compound 5 (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001
μM).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, our results demonstrated the biological activity
of novel small molecules 3–11 designed
by crafting pharmacophoric functional groups of vorinostat and tubastatin-A
into a single molecular entity. These carbazole-based new molecules
were synthesized from carbazole in three to five steps, as depicted
in scheme 1–6. In addition, all of the new compounds 3–11 have shown the potential pan HDAC inhibition activity with
increased levels of acetylated histone and tubulin. In addition, the
most potent neuroactive compound 5 has shown selectivity
for class II over class I HDACs. Furthermore, novel HDAC inhibitors 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 exhibited potent neurite outgrowth
activity, and interestingly, one of the novel HDAC inhibitors, 8-(9H-carbazol-3-yl)-N-hydroxyoctanamide (compound 5), has shown significantly more neurite outgrowth compared
to vorinostat and tubastatin-A and also better antidepressant- and
anxiolytic-like activity in chronic stress-induced Zebrafish model.
However, further studies are required to assess the efficacy of this
novel HDACi in rodent models and the toxicity, if any, after its long-term
in vivo administration. Thus, these results suggest that the novel
HDAC inhibitors crafted with vorinostat and tubastatin-A pharmacophoric
moieties can be developed as potential therapeutics to treat anxiety,
depression, and related psychiatric disorders.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All of the reagents and solvents
used were analytically pure. Carbazole was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The progress of chemical reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on precoated silica gel GF254 plates. The TLC plates were then
visualized under UV illumination at 254 nm. For further visualization,
the TLC plates were stained with phosphomolybdic acid and charred
on a hot plate. Column chromatography was carried out using silica
gel finer than 200 mesh. The columns were packed in hexane and equilibrated
with appropriate solvent/solvent mixture prior to use. The Fisher–Johns
melting point apparatus was used for measuring the melting points.
Analytical HPLC (SPD-M20A, Shimadzu, Japan) was used for determining
the purity of all compounds (>96%). Infrared (IR) spectra were
recorded
as neat liquids or KBr pellets, and the absorptions are reported in
cm–1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were
recorded at 400 MHz (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) spectrometers in appropriate
solvents. We used tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard;
the chemical shifts are shown in δ scales. 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a 100 MHz spectrometer. Multiplicities of 1H NMR signals were designated as s (singlet), d (doublet),
t (triplet), q (quartet), br (broad), m (multiplet, for unresolved
lines), etc. High-resolution mass spectra were recorded using ESI-QTOF
mass spectrometry.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 15–17
A mixture of glutaric anhydride (21.40
mmol) and anhydrous
AlCl3 (21.40 mmol) in dichloromethane (25 mL) was added
slowly to a stirring solution of 9-benzyl-9H-carbazole 12 (5.0 g, 19.45 mmol) in dichloromethane (25 mL) at 0 °C
and then refluxed for 3 h. After completion (TLC), it was cooled to
0 °C and excess AlCl3 was quenched with 1 N HCl, organic
layer was separated, washed with water, dried over anhydride Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Crude
residue was purified over silica gel column chromatography and eluted
with ethyl acetate to give 5-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-5-oxopentanoic
acid (15) as a semisolid (4.75 g, 62%). Similarly, adipic
anhydride and suberic anhydride gave 6-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-6-oxohexanoic acid (16) and 8-(9-benzyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-8-oxooctanoic acid (17) in
60 and 55% yields, respectively.

Cell Culture Maintenance
Neuro2A
(mouse neuroblastoma)
and GL-261 (mouse glioblastoma) lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Neuro2A and GL-261 cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gibco), penicillin/streptomycin (1×), Non-Essential
Amino Acids Solution (1×), and sodium pyruvate (1×) at 37
°C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2.

HDAC Inhibition Assay
The HDAC inhibitory activity
was measured using Epigenase HDAC activity/inhibition direct assay
colorimetric kit from Epigentek (catalog- P4034). The nuclear extract
of GL261 cells was used as an enriched source of HDAC enzyme. The
protocol was followed according to the user guide provided with the
kit. Vorinostat (SAHA) and tubastatin-A have been used as a positive
control. All of the compounds were screened for HDACi activity at
10, 1, 0.1, and 0.01 μM concentrations, and IC50 values
are calculated for all of the small molecules.

HDACi Selectivity
Assay
Human cervical cancer, HeLA,
cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1× Pen-strep solution
and 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C. The cells were subcultured
twice a week. The cells were harvested when 80% confluent and lysed
in IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,
0.5% Triton X-100, 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) to isolate
total proteins. Antibody (2 μg) (HDAC8, HDAC4, and HDAC6) is
incubated with 60 μL of Dyna beads for 30 min on rotation. Then,
100 μg of total protein was added to the bead–antibody
complex and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C on rotation. The beads
were washed with lysis buffer and used as enzyme source for the activity
assay. For HDAC activity assay,46 the bead-bound
enzyme was incubated with HDAC substrate, Fluor-de-lys (Enzo Life
Sciences), and different concentrations (10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001
μM) of compound 5 for 15 min, followed by addition
of developer solution according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Enzo Life Sciences), and the fluorescence was measured at 360 and
460 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The % HDAC
enzyme activity is calculated as a ratio to vehicle-treated control.

Neurite Outgrowth Assay
Neurite outgrowth activity
assay was performed as reported.47 Briefly,
mouse neuroblastoma cells Neuro2A were seeded at 8000 cells/cm2 in six-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were induced to
differentiate using serum-deprived media (DMEM + 1% FBS). After 6
h, the cells were incubated with different concentrations of compounds
and were observed for neurite outgrowth activity 48 h after the treatment.
Bright-field images of Neuro2A cells treated with different concentrations
of compounds were used to measure the neurite outgrowth activity.
The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS
in preparation for the immunocytochemical reaction. To determine how
neurite outgrowth was affected by different concentrations of compounds,
the average neurite length was measured (using ImageJ software) on
60 neurons from six microscopic fields randomly captured as two images
per well, from three independent experiments.

Cell Viability
Assay
Neuro2A cells were seeded at a
concentration of 10 000 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates.
After 24 h, the cells were induced to differentiate with serum deprivation
(1% FBS) and incubated with different concentrations of compounds
for 72 h. The percentage of cell viability was measured by MTT assay,
as described previously by us.47 MTT [(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide] (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells in the
culture medium at a concentration of 5 mg/mL and incubated for 2 h
at 37 °C. Formazan crystals were solubilized in DMSO, and the
absorbance was measured at 562 nm. Data were analyzed as relative
activity in comparison to the vehicle treatment group.

Immunocytochemistry
Neuro2A cells, incubated with different
concentrations of compounds, were processed for the immunostaining
following our earlier protocol.47 Briefly,
the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature
for 15 min, and permeabilization was done with 0.5% Triton X-100 and
0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS, followed by incubation in blocking
buffer (2% bovine serum albumin + 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS)
for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibody against β-III
tubulin (1:200, Millipore) was used. Samples were incubated with the
primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. The samples
were washed with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with
goat antimouse IgG conjugated to antirabbit cy5 (1:1000). Images were
captured using a MoticAE31 microscope.

Immunoblotting
Cells in wells were incubated with compounds,
vehicle, with and without inhibitor treatment, washed with 1×
PBS, and harvested in 1× Laemmli buffer. Protein estimation was
done with the amido black method, and an equal amount of protein was
loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE gel, followed by transfer onto the PVDF membrane.
The blocking was done for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation
with primary antibodies acetyl tubulin (1:1000), tubulin (1:2000),
acetyl H3 (1:1000) (Millipore), and actin (1:5000) (Sigma) at 4 °C
overnight. Incubation with secondary antibody antirabbit (1:5000),
antimouse (1:10 000) was done at room temperature for 2 h.
The blots were developed with Vilber Lourmat chemdoc instrument using
super signal west dura luminal/enhancer solution (Thermo).

Animals
and Housing
Adult Zebrafish (Danio rerio) were
bred and raised in captivity. All of the animals were raised in large
tanks with a natural daylight/dark cycle and two feedings until they
arrived in the laboratory. In the fish laboratory, the animals were
acclimatized to the experimental room conditions by maintaining them
at 28 ± 2 °C, 14/10 h light/dark cycle, three feedings,
and constant aeration. After the habituation period, the animals were
grouped as control and test sets, and the test animals were subjected
to two different stressors per day for a period of 7 days. Fish which
exhibited stress-induced phenotypic changes, assessed by novel tank
test and social interaction test, were treated intraperitoneal with
compound 5 at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, with fluoxetine at
15 mg/kg, for about 3 days. Following behavioral testing (before and
after drug treatment), all of the fish were euthanized and the brain
was immediately dissected out for further analysis. All animal procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC/IICT/Protocol
No. 26/2016).

Chronic Unpredictable Stress (CUS) Paradigm
in Zebrafish
CUS paradigm was performed with appropriate
minor modifications to
our previously published protocol.43 Briefly,
for a period of 7 days, the fish were subjected to a variety of chronic
stressors, two stressors per day (forenoon and afternoon), such as
restraint stress (RS), heat stress (HS), cold stress (CS), social
isolation (SI), overcrowding (OC), predator stress (PS), dorsal body
exposure (DBE), tank change (TC), chasing (C), and alarm pheromone
stress (APS). In restraint stress (RS), each animal was restrained
for an hour in a 2 mL micro-centrifuge tube with perforations at both
the ends for free water flow; for heat stress (HS) and cold stress
(CS), the animals were transferred to new tanks maintained at 33 and
23 °C, respectively, for 30 min; social isolation (SI) was given
in separate beakers for 60 min; overcrowding (OC) with 10 animals
in a 250 mL beaker containing only 150 mL of water for 60 min; in
predator stress (PS), the test animals were exposed to predator (cichlid
fish) encounters (chases and attacks) for 1 min; in dorsal body exposure
(DBE), the animals were housed in tanks with the low water level to
expose the animal’s dorsal body for 2 min; in tank change (TC)
stress, fish were transferred from one tank to another about six consecutive
times; in chasing (C), fish were chased with a net for 8 min; in alarm
pheromone stress (APS), the test fish was exposed to water containing
the washing of epidermal cells from euthanized/sliced Zebrafish, for
30 min. To avoid habituation to stressors, unpredictability was maintained
by changing the time and sequence of stressors daily during the 7-day
stress paradigm. Aeration and temperature were controlled during the
presentation of each stressor, except during heating and cooling stress.
The nonstressed control group was maintained in the same room during
the 7-day stress period.

Behavior
Tests
The events were first recorded by a video camera (Sony
Handycam)
and later scored manually by two independent blinded observers and
analyzed together.

Novel Tank Test (NTT)
NTT was performed
as our previously
reported protocol.43 Briefly, Zebrafish
were placed individually in a narrow 15 × 12 × 25 cm3 tank with a water depth of 18 cm divided into three equal,
virtually horizontal sections and demarcated by a line on the outside
of the tank wall. In the 2 min novel tank test, the time spent by
the fish in different levels of the tank (bottom, middle, or upper
level) was measured to assess the level of anxiety. A preference for
the bottom and less frequent venturing into the middle and upper levels
of the tank is suggestive of increased anxiety. Similarly, longer
latency to enter the middle and upper levels, greater numbers of freezing
bouts and longer durations in freezing mode indicates the anxious
phenotype, as does the increased locomotor activity (number of crosses
in the swim area).

Social Interaction Test
Depression
has been well reported
to affect the social behavior of the subjects exposed to chronic stressful
conditions, as reported in mice.48 The
social avoidance behavior of the stressed Zebrafish at the end of
the stress paradigm was assessed by the social interaction test based
on the approach and interaction fervor with an unfamiliar conspecific
target (pink Zebrafish) as described by us.49 Briefly, experimental Zebrafish were introduced into the tank with
the target in the interaction box for 120 s and a conspecific pink
Zebrafish served as a target in the interaction zone. The entire test
was video recorded with a Sony Handycam Camcorder 200E in HD mode
and later analyzed using manual scoring. The socializing ability of
the fish was individually assessed by interaction parameters like
latency, interaction time, and freezing duration.

Tissue Extraction
and Sample Preparation for Thin-Layer Chromatography
(TLC)
To know the ability of compound 5 to cross
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), Zebrafish were divided into
two groups. The first group was treated with compound 5 at 25 mg/kg dose, and the other was treated with DMSO (vehicle).
For the detection of compound 5 in the brain samples,
a protocol reported by Woo et al. with minor modifications was adapted.50 Zebrafish from both the groups were anesthetized
by placing them on ice, and complete brain was taken out and freeze-dried
in liquid nitrogen. To these samples, HPLC-grade ethyl acetate was
added, finely ground, and subjected to sonication, followed by centrifugation
(10 000 rpm for 20 min) and incubation for 20 min to allow
the separation of brain tissues and their ethyl acetate extracts.
Later, the supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.22 μ
filters. The filtered extracts (E1, E2) were vacuum-dried by rota
evaporation and dissolved in HPLC-grade methanol. On the other hand,
compound 5 was also dissolved in HPLC-grade methanol
to use as a standard (S). The TLC profiling was performed with a solvent
system of methanol:chloroform (5:95) with S, E1, and E2. After running
on TLC, observations were made by iodine staining and visualization
under a UV transilluminator.

Statistical Analysis
The results
were expressed as
mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Data were subjected
by either two-tailed paired Student’s t-test
or ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis, depending
on the number of samples to compare, using GraphPad Prism software.
A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
