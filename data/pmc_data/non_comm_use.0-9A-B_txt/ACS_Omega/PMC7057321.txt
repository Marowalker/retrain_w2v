Gold nanostructures have always been a subject of interest
to physicists,
chemists, and material scientists. Despite the extensive research
associated with gold nanoparticles, their actual formation mechanism
is still debatable. The nanoscale rearrangements leading to the formation
of gold nanostructures of definite size and shape are contradictory.
The study presented in here details out a mechanism for gold nanoparticle
formation in the presence of a biological template. The kinetics of
gold nanostructure formation was studied using glycated hemoglobin
as a biological template as well as the reducing agent. Particle formation
was studied in a time- and temperature-dependent manner using different
biophysical techniques. Here, we report for the first time spontaneous
formation of gold nanoflowers which gradually dissociates to form
smaller spherical particles. In addition, our experiments conclusively
substantiate the existing postulations on gold nanoparticle formation
from relatively larger precursor structures of gold and contradict
with the popular nucleation growth mechanism.

Introduction
Gold nanostructures find application in
a range of fields of biological,
physical, chemical, and medical sciences.1−5 The in situ synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs)
involve two major reactions, reduction of gold ions to atomic gold
and the stabilization of the resultant structures.6 A number of chemical as well as biological agents are reported
to be capable of synthesizing GNPs when used as a template or reducing
agent. Among them, trisodium citrate is well studied and frequently
employed owing to its use as both reducing agent and stabilizer for
the fabrication of a range of gold nanostructures.7−9 Recently, biological
agents have gained popularity toward their use in GNP synthesis, principally
for applications in the field of medical sciences because of its superior
cytocompatibility and biocompatibility compared to other chemical
reducing agents.10−12

In the
bottom-up chemical synthesis of metallic nanomaterials,
the post-reduction growth kinetics of nanostructures has drawn particular
attention from scientists all over the world, ever since Turkevich
studied the nucleation and growth in gold colloids.12 Studying the growth kinetics of gold nanostructures is
important owing to its versatile application potentials.

Biological
and chemical sensing is an emerging application of GNPs
considering its unique physical and optical properties. Taking into
account the use of GNPs for sensing applications, the mechanism of
sensing differs either by synthesis, aggregation, or interaction.13−15 Here, aggregation and interaction studies are based on the already prepared
GNPs, and sensing enabled through synthesis depends on the growth
of GNPs from a template which is the target molecule. Different proteins
are reported to carry out the formation of gold nanoclusters based
on their activity towards the reduction of gold salt.16,17 Extracts from different plant species’ known to be rich in
proteins, sugars, amino acids, and secondary metabolites including
flavonoids and alkaloids can direct the growth of GNPs of different
sizes and shapes.18 Leng et al. in 2016
suggested that synthesis of GNPs using different proteins such as
hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin can be used as a means for sensing of
proteins on the basis of colorimetric profile of the formed GNPs.13 GNPs which are found to be able to differentiate
among structural and conformational alterations in proteins are also
reported to be capable of sensing the protein conformational changes
associated with glycation.15,19−22 Nonenzymatic glycation is an important physiological phenomena having
clinical significances in diabetes and associated complications. The
products of nonenzymatic glycation are known to possess high reducing
properties because of the formation of resultant molecules of a large
number of functional groups.23−26

In a previous study, it was demonstrated that
the color of colloidal
GNPs when synthesized using the glycated Hb (HBF) template varied
among differentially glycated samples.27 The present study discusses the biological synthesis of GNPs using
a glycated Hb template. Glycated proteins are capable of synthesizing
stable gold nanostructures in combination with a chemical reducing
agent28 owing to their higher reactivity
post glycation. Also, in a previous study, we have found that advanced
glycation end products (AGEs) produced as a result of glycation provide
a good reducing environment required for the synthesis of GNPs.29 Here, we have performed in vitro glycation of
human hemoglobin A0 (Hb) at 37 °C by using fructose as a reducing
sugar and synthesized GNPs from glycated Hb (HBF) without the use
of any additional reducing agents. Unlike the conventional methods
reported for chemical or biological syntheses of GNPs, our method
was performed at room temperature (RT) (25 °C).30 Here, the formation of GNPs is postulated to be mediated
by the AGEs produced as a result of the nonenzymatic glycation reaction.
The HBF_GNPs thus formed were characterized in detail, and the kinetics
of formation of the particles were studied using absorption spectroscopy
and electron microscopy. Our kinetically controlled approach for the
synthesis of GNPs enabled greater understanding of the growth kinetics
of GNPs from a biological template along with identification of predominant
intermediates in HBF-mediated GNP synthesis.

Results
Characterization of Hemoglobin Glycation and AGE Formation
At first, HBF was characterized for the formation of AGEs and the
development of reducing properties, prior to GNP synthesis (Figure 1A). HBF showed significantly
higher fluorescence emission at 450 nm (p = 0.0000338)
compared to its nonglycated counterpart (HBC), confirming the formation
of AGEs as a result of nonenzymatic glycation.31 HBC showed a minimal reducing property as measured by the
ferric ion reduction test (Materials and Methods), whereas HBF showed significantly higher reducing activity (p = 0.000000793). Once AGE formation was confirmed, this
was used as a template to synthesize GNPs.

Formation of GNPs from Glycated Hb (HBF)
Consistent
with the reducing properties and presence of AGEs, only HBF produced
stable GNPs in colloidal solution (Figure 1B inset). GNPs produced from HBF showed surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) peak centered around 525 nm (marked red) (Figure 1B). The HBF_GNPs
were found to be stable with a negative zeta potential of −33.8
mV. The size and morphology of the particles were analyzed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The population of particles was nearly
spherical in shape except for a few elongated structures (Figure 1D). The elongated
structures marked in Figure 1D are expected to be the intermediates formed during the synthesis.
A single gold particle with the 111 plane marked is shown in the Figure 1D as inset. The mean
particle size was calculated to be 16.824 with a standard deviation
of ±2.998 nm (Figure 1E) which was also confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS)
size measurements (Figure S1A). The polycrystalline
nature of the synthesized particles was confirmed by X-ray diffraction
(XRD) (Figure 1C) and
selective area electron diffraction (SAED) (Figure 1C inset) and confirmed the growth of particles
in 111, 200, 220, and 311 planes of the fcc lattice. The elemental
composition of the synthesized particles was analyzed using energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. The presence of gold was confirmed in HBF_GNPs
and traces of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen substantiated the capping
of synthesized GNPs with the products of glycation of Hb (Figure S1B). Thus, the use of HBF for the synthesis
of GNPs was established, and it was found to direct the synthesis
of particles of less than 20 nm diameters with a negative zeta potential.

Mechanism of Formation of HBF_GNPs
The kinetics of
the reaction involving the synthesis of HBF_GNPs was studied in detail
till stable GNPs were formed. After the addition of gold salt and
HBF at 25 °C, the reaction was monitored upto 303 hrs. Initially,
the color of the gold colloid changed from colorless to black and
later to purple and finally stabilized as pink (Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B, the SPR peak for the colloidal GNPs increased
in intensity and the absorption maxima shifted to the left as the
reaction proceeded, suggesting an increase in the particle number
accompanied by a reduction in particle size.32 As evident from Figure 2C, the intensity of the gold colloid which is a measure of
the number of particles present at a distinct time point increased
slowly at the start of the reaction followed by a steady enhancement
till 50 h followed by its stabilization at around 80 h. Similarly,
the SPR peak centered around 545 nm at the start of the reaction first
shifted slightly to higher wavelengths and then steadily dropped to
525 nm post 50 h, showing a reduction in particle size with time.
The observed nature is in agreement with the color transitions of
colloidal solutions over time. The spectroscopic study of the kinetics
of GNP synthesis from HBF indicated a mechanism that involves the
generation of larger structures of gold which gradually dissociates
to smaller spherical structures which is in contrary to the LaMer’s
model of nucleation and growth.33

HBF_GNP formation, (B) absorption profile of HBF_GNPs, and (C) absorption
maxima profile for HBF_GNPs from the start of the reaction (0H) to
303H.

In order to support this notion, TEM analysis was
carried out for
the gold colloids at different time points during the course of the
reaction. Aliquots were taken out at regular intervals and were drop-casted
onto carbon-coated copper grids for performing TEM. Figure 3 outlines the maturation of
GNPs during the synthesis mediated by HBF. Figure 3A–G represents the morphology of the
nanostructures as viewed under TEM at 1, 12, 18, 36, 44, 65, and 180
h from the start of the synthesis, respectively.

respectively.

Table 1 summarizes
the morphological features of these nanostructures along with the
histogram plots of mean diameters. As the reaction progresses, the
irregularly shaped slightly elongated nanostructures reshapes into
regular particles which are predominantly spherical, whereas the crystallinity
of particles at all the time points remained the same, corresponding
to a polycrystalline particle with lattice points of an fcc crystal
(Figure S2). As observed in here, the diameter
of the particles remained more or less the same even though the color
of the colloidal solutions was distinct at these time points (Figure 2A). The morphological
differences in the gold nanostructures from HBF as observed under
the electron microscope hints at a transformation of structures during
the course of the reaction rather than growth and maturation of a
preformed nuclei.

Table 1 Particle Size Distribution of HBF_GNPs
with Time
Structural Evolution of HBF_GNPs
In order to investigate
the insights into the structural transformations associated with GNP
synthesis from HBF, we lowered the rate of the reaction by reducing
the HBF concentration. This allowed us to carefully analyze the structures
formed at the start of the reaction. Figure 4 represents the transmission electron micrographs
of gold nanostructures with 0.3 mg/mL (Figure 4A–C) concentration of HBF. At this
significantly lower concentration of HBF, we observed concurrent occurrence
of large networks of gold nanochains with diameters less than 10 nm
and gold nanoflowers of 100 nm diameter with each petals having a
diameter less than 10 nm (Figure 4D). It is to be noted that at this concentration where
larger structures of gold were observed, the colloidal solution of
gold remained colorless or grayish in appearance. The inset of Figure 4D shows the electron
micrograph of a single flower. With the increase in concentration
of HBF, the morphology of particles changed from large networks of
gold/gold nanoflowers to irregularly shaped particles to regular spheres
(Figure 5A–C)
and the size of the particles reduced (Figure 5D,E).

distribution of flower-like particles (inset: a single flower of gold,

by using (A) 0.6, (B) 0.8, and (C) 1 mg/mL of HBF, and (D–F)
the respective particle size distributions.

Because HBF_GNPs with the lowest concentration
of HBF (0.3 mg/mL)
had both chains and flowers, it was difficult to elucidate if the
chain evolved from the flowers or chains transformed into flowers.
Either way, it was confirmed that the particles formed at the end
of the reaction with HBF were generated as breakdown products of the
larger structures as the reaction proceeded. Here, as the larger structures
broke down, initially, the particles formed were around 12 nm in size
(Figure 5D,E), which
later rearranged to form spherical particles (Figure 5F). Throughout the concentrations used, the
polycrystalline nature of the gold nanostructures remained consistent
(Figure S3). Thus, here, we established
that in HBF-mediated GNP synthesis, the reaction starts with the formation
of large networks of gold which periodically disintegrates to form
stable spherical nanoparticles. Although the intermediates during
the synthesis ultimately rearranges to form spherical particles, these
intermediates were found to be stable for longer periods when stored
at 4 °C.

Resolving the Structural Transformations in HBF_GNPs
The results discussed previously confirm the formation of large networks
of gold from the HBF template which gradually dissociates to form
small spherical particles. In order to differentiate between the stages
of formation of gold nanochains and gold nanoflowers during the synthesis,
we performed the GNP synthesis at lower temperatures while keeping
the concentration of HBF the same and compared the particle formation
at two different temperatures. As demonstrated in Figure 6, reaction performed at 25
°C generated only flowers (Figure 6A) and the one performed at 37 °C formed both
nanoflowers and nanochains (Figure 6B). Flowers formed at 37 °C in which the reaction
was kinetically faster had a denser core compared to the one formed
at 25 °C. These results suggested that the formation of nanoflowers
must have taken place at the start of the reaction which then unfolds
to form networks of gold nanochains that further breaks down to form
smaller spherical particles.

synthesized at (A) 25 and (B) 37 °C. Insets showing the TEM image
of a single gold nanoflower (scale bar = 20 nm).

To further confirm this notion, we took three different
samples
of HBF generated by decreasing the concentration of protein (2, 1,
and 0.5 mg/mL) and used them for the synthesis of GNPs. Although the
samples differed in the concentration of the protein (Figure 7A), the amount of AGE was kept
the same as indicated in Figure 7B. The reducing property of the three samples also
remained more or less the same with 0.5 mg/mL being slightly less
reducing in nature (Figure 7C). Figure 7D–F represents the TEM image of nanostructures synthesized
from the three different HBF samples. The sample with a higher protein
concentration (2 mg/mL) generated both nanoflowers and nanochains
(Figure 7D), whereas
the samples with lower protein concentrations (1 and 0.5 mg/mL) generated
only nanoflowers (Figure 7E,F). Here, the density of the core of the nanoflower and
the diameter decreased as the protein concentration decreased. Here,
although reducing power was a constant, the amount of protein in each
samples determined the kinetics of the reaction, wherein availability
of higher number of templates (2 mg/mL protein) enhanced the rate
of reaction considerably.

concentrations.

of (D) 2, (E) 1, and (F) 0.5 mg/mL.

In all, these results confirmed the formation of
spherical nanoparticles
from larger structures of gold when HBF was used as a template as
well as the reducing agent. Evident from the TEM studies, HBF seeds
the gold atoms and are self-assembled to form bulky flowers of gold
which gradually unfolds into long networks of nanochains which further
dissociates to form regular spherical GNPs.

Discussion
According to the LaMer nucleation growth
model, in a typical citrate
reduction approach, nuclei are formed as a result of random collision
of gold atoms, and the nucleus grows progressively till the size of
the particles is stabilized.33 Polte et
al. in 2010 studied the mechanism of GNP formation in the classical
citrate reduction method using coupled in situ X-ray absorption near-edge
spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray spectroscopy (SAXS) and proposed
a model in which coalescence of nuclei and further attachment of monomers
result in particles of desired size.34 But the development of colours during
the reaction of GNP synthesis cannot be explained by this.

Our
results substantiate the presence of larger intermediates during
the reaction of GNP synthesis (Figures 2–4). Even at different
concentrations of the HBF used, network-like structures of gold were
observed which entitles the same as an intermediate during the reaction
rather than being produced at a particular concentration of the HBF
used. For the first time, we here report the spontaneous formation
of gold nanoflowers with the use of HBF as a template as well as the
reducing agent. These structures were stable for longer time periods
and do not undergo any structural alterations when stored at 4 °C.
Although the flower is formed as an intermediate during the reaction,
the seeds formed at the start were anisotropic in nature which is
highly unlikely in a typical GNP synthesis approach.

In 2004,
in an attempt to synthesize 2D networks of gold, Pei et
al. showed that once the nucleus was formed, gold atoms were found
to be attached to the nucleus in a strong manner, forming elongated
chain like structures of gold and as the reaction proceeded, particles
were formed from the chains.35 Although
subsequent studies substantiated this observation, the phenomenon
could not be explained in a unified manner36−38 and it was
only in 2017 that Jakhmola et al. confirmed the formation of networks
of gold as an intermediate during GNP synthesis involving lower reaction
rates.39 In 2018, Lee et al. reported the
spontaneous formation of gold nanostructures in aqueous microdroplets.
In this kinetically controlled reaction, linear nanowires and aggregated
structures of gold were observed. However, rather than referring it
to as an intermediate of GNP formation, this study reported the spontaneous
formation of different nanostructures.40 Also, recently, Yan et al. reported the controlled synthesis of
branched structures of gold with the use of engineered peptoids, which
are structurally similar to what we obtained as an intermediate in
our work.41 A number of perspectives still
remain unanswered regarding the kinetics associated to GNP formation.
Taking into account the enormous reports published in this area, scientists
were able to confirm the presence of large intermediates during the
formation of GNPs using TEM, atomic force microscopy, and DLS, whereas
in situ SAXS and XPS failed to catch the intermediates or these techniques
captured the progressive growth of nanoparticles in size during the
reaction. Our study clearly established the presence of mesoscale
structures of gold during the synthesis, proving the formation of
smaller spherical nanoparticles from larger intermediates. The parameters
to control the growth of nanoparticles were kept the minimum as in
the synthesis was performed at RT, and no external mixing was provided.
The entire synthesis was dependent on the concentration of the reactants
used.

From what we observed in our study and what is already
available
in the literature, the evolution of mesoscale structures of gold can
be regarded as an intermediate during GNP synthesis when carried out
at extremely low reaction rates. In this study, the low reaction kinetics
was obtained by using HBF, which acts as both reducing agent and template.
Earlier reports suggest that the mesoscale gold nanostructures can
be obtained with the commonly used reducing agent trisodium citrate
as well; hence, the evolution of such structures must be dependent
on the rate of reduction of gold ions to gold atoms which in turn
relies on the concentration of the reactants and temperature. In a
report published in 2008 by Ji et al., pH of the reaction mixture
was found to be a determining factor for the particle formation through
nucleation growth or nucleation aggregation.37 Though conclusive reports are not available stating whether particle
formation occurs through nucleation growth or breakdown of mesoscale
structures or it is a combination of both, using HBF as a template,
we could prove important aspects involved in the mechanism of GNP
formation that could add to the long debated postulations on GNP synthesis.

Conclusions
Studying the mechanism of GNP formation
from different templates
is an important aspect owing to the ever growing applications of gold
nanostructures in biological, physical, and chemical sciences. Our
study aimed at studying the general route of GNP formation using a
biological reducing agent. In order to draw any similarities or differences,
we compared the synthesis with that from the commonly used reducing
agent TSC as well. Our results substantiated the existence of mesoscale
structures of gold during the synthetic route for particle formation,
which was clearly established using electron micrographs and spectroscopic
studies. This study contradicts the well-known LaMer model of nucleation
and growth33 which states that gold atoms
fuse to form nuclei and combines to form particles until a stable
size is approached. Several studies later were able to prove that
a typical synthetic protocol for the synthesis of GNPs involves the
formation of larger intermediates of gold which gradually breaks down
to form stable GNPs.36,38,39,42 Although our results clearly explains the
presence of mesoscale structures during the formation of GNPs, we
observed the formation of anisotropic nuclei at first which grows
into a marigold-like gold nanoflower. These larger structures of gold
had diameters of more than 100 nm, which further unfold into linear
networks and finally break down to particles of around 20 nm in diameter.
These mesoscale structures of gold formed during the synthesis of
GNPs can find applications in sensing, catalysis, and drug delivery
owing to their distinct structural aspects. Also, results from this
study is assumed to contribute to the many of the quests that still
remains unclear in the colloidal synthesis of GNPs.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Hemoglobin A0 (Hb) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
India Pvt. Ltd. Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III)trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) was purchased from Loba Chemie. Fructose,
potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate (KH2PO4),
dipotassium hydrogen orthophosphate (K2HPO4),
sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate (NaH2PO4),
disodium hydrogen orthophosphate (Na2HPO4),
potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]), trichloroacetic
acid (TCA), ferric chloride (FeCl3), and hydrochloric acid
(HCl) were of analytical grade purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific
India Pvt. Ltd and used without further purification. Milli-Q ultrapure
water (>18 MΩ) was used for all of the experiments.

Methods
Glycation of Hemoglobin (Hb)
Glycation of Hb was performed
under sterile conditions, and all of the glassware and plastic ware
were autoclaved before use. Stock solutions of Hb and fructose were
prepared in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For glycation,
1 mg/mL Hb was incubated with 100 mM fructose in an incubator set
at 37 °C. The concentration of reactants for the preparation
of glycated Hb (HBF) was kept a constant unless mentioned. Samples
were taken after 0 and 10 days of incubation and stored at −20
°C until used. The formation of AGEs in the HBF samples was confirmed
using UV–visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence emission
spectroscopy. The controls for the glycation experiment consisted
of the physical mixture of fructose and Hb without incubation (HBC)
and fructose alone (F).

Evaluation of Reducing Properties of HBF and HBC
The
reducing property of HBF was determined by the method described by
Gu et al. with slight modifications.43 HBF
was mixed with 1 mL of 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7 and
1 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide following which it was incubated
in a water bath set at 50 °C for 20 min. The mixture was brought
back to RT and mixed with 1 mL of 10% TCA. To 1 mL of this, 1 mL of
distilled water and 200 μL of 0.1% ferric chloride were added.
The light absorbance of the resultant mixture was measured at 700
nm in a 1 mL quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length using PerkinElmer,
LAMBDA 25 UV–visible Spectrometer. For comparison, the reducing
property of HBC was measured and 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
of pH 7.4 served as the negative control. A higher absorbance at 700
nm indicates a higher reducing property.

Synthesis of GNPs from HBF (HBF_GNPs)
All of the glassware
used for GNP synthesis were washed with 1 N HCl and rinsed with ethanol
and ultrapure water. Briefly, 32 μL of aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (1% w/v) was added to 3.868 mL of Milli-Q water. HBF (100
μL ) (1 mg/mL) was then added to the gold salt solution and
mixed for 1 min. The reaction mixture was left at 25 °C and the
color change of the gold colloid from gray to purple to pink was observed
till it stabilized. As a negative control, synthesis was also attempted
with HBC.

Physical Characterization of GNPs
The extinction profile
for the synthesized HBF_GNPs was obtained from the UV–visible
absorption spectra performed using the LAMBDA 25 UV–visible
spectrometer, PerkinElmer. Spectra were obtained by performing a scan
from 200 to 700 nm in a 1 mL quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. The
gold colloids were diluted with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
of pH 7.4 before performing the scans.

The size and morphological
features of the HBF_GNPs and SAED pattern were obtained by performing
electron microscopy using the transmission electron microscope, JEOL
2100F, with an incident energy of 200 keV. Prior to viewing, the GNPs
were concentrated by centrifugation of the colloidal gold solutions,
and the concentrated samples were drop-casted onto copper grids of
300 mesh size.

The crystallinity of the HBF_GNPs was investigated
using X-ray
diffraction (PANalytical X’pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54 Å). For this, thin films of HBF_GNPs were prepared
on clean glass slides by repeated drop-casting. The elemental analysis
of GNPs was performed using the scanning electron microscope coupled
with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Zeiss EVO40). Zeta potential
and particle size analysis using DLS were carried out with Zetasizer
Nano Z from Malvern Panalytical.
