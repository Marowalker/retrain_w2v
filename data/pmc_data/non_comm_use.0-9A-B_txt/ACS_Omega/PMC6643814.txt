Silicon (Si) and
composites thereof, preferably with carbon (C),
show favorable lithium (Li) storage properties at low potential, and
thus hold promise for application as anode active materials in the
energy storage area. However, the high theoretical specific capacity
of Si afforded by the alloying reaction with Li involves many challenges.
In this article, we report the preparation of small-size Si particles
with a turbostratic carbon shell from a polymer precoated powder material.
Galvanostatic charge/discharge experiments conducted on electrodes
with practical loadings resulted in much improved capacity retention
and kinetics for the Si/C composite particles compared to physical
mixtures of pristine Si particles and carbon black, emphasizing the
positive effect that the core–shell-type morphology has on
the cycling performance. Using in situ differential electrochemical
mass spectrometry, pressure, and acoustic emission measurements, we
gain insights into the gassing behavior, the bulk volume expansion,
and the mechanical degradation of the Si/C composite-containing electrodes.
Taken together, our research data demonstrate that some of the problems
of high-content Si anodes can be mitigated by carbon coating. Nonetheless,
continuous electrolyte decomposition, particle fracture, and electrode
restructuring due to the large volume changes during battery operation
(here, ∼170% in the voltage range of 600–30 mV vs Li+/Li) remain as serious hurdles toward practical implementation.

Introduction
The demands imposed
on battery materials with respect to energy
storage capacity, durability, cost, and so forth are ever increasing.
State-of-the-art high-energy-density Li-ion cells are based on layered
lithium transition metal oxides LiMO2 (M = Ni, Co, and
Mn or Al) as cathode active materials (≈150–200 mAh
g–1 usable discharge capacity)1−4 and graphite, with a theoretical
specific capacity of 372 mAh g–1, as an anode active
material.4,5 Incorporating some fraction of silicon (Si)
(3579 mAh gSi–1 for Li15Si4) into the negative electrode has been shown to be an effective
strategy to further improve the specific energy.6−8 For example,
Yim et al. prepared and tested anodes with a polyetherimide binder
using composites made of graphite and Si powder (5 wt %). The best
performing electrodes showed a specific capacity of 514 mAh g–1 after 350 cycles which, according to the authors,
was 1.6 times higher than commercial graphite anodes.7 However, achieving stable cycling performance of “high-content”
and “high-loading” Si anodes is very challenging.

The most severe drawbacks of Si as the anode active material are
(i) the large irreversibilities, especially during the first couple
of cycles, because of side reactions with the electrolyte for instance
and (ii) the large volume changes upon alloying with Li, leading to
particle fracture and anode self-pulverization.9−13 Note that all of these adverse effects not only cause
significant impedance build-up during battery operation, but also
result in Li consumption from the cathode. Furthermore, it has been
shown that the contact loss of Si particles from the conductive carbon
black/binder network and/or current collector leads to accelerated
capacity degradation.13,14

In recent years, many attempts
have been made to overcome the main
problems of Si anodes by testing of novel and/or improved electrolytes,
additives, and polymer binders.11,13,15−17 In addition, the focus was on the preparation of
advanced Si-based redox-active materials. From these studies—only
some of which have been considered here—it seems that especially
Si and SiOx materials and composites thereof,
preferably with nanoscale carbons, hold promise in future energy storage
applications.18−21 For example, Breitung et al. produced a composite made of Si particles
and carbonaceous nanofibers, showing around two times higher specific
capacity than electrodes with pristine Si particles after hundreds
of cycles.18 Hu et al. demonstrated improved
capacity retention for carbon-coated Si particles, which were obtained
by hydrothermal carbonization of glucose in the presence of Si.19 Inspired by these studies, in the present work,
we aimed at preparing nanoscale Si/C composites with a core–shell-type
structure from polymer precoated Si particles.

The powder samples
after carbonization at temperatures ranging
from 700 to 900 °C were characterized by a combination of electron
microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy, and their Li-storage
properties were investigated by galvanostatic cycling experiments
in half-cells. In addition, the volume expansion, gassing behavior,
and mechanical deformation/degradation of practical electrodes using
the Si/C composite particles were analyzed via in situ pressure, differential
electrochemical mass spectrometry, and acoustic emission measurements,
respectively.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
After
polymerization—details of which
are given in the Experimental Section—the
precursor material, containing ≈20 wt % Si (see thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) in Figure S1), was heated
under an argon atmosphere at temperatures of 700, 800, or 900 °C
to convert the organic shell into carbon. However, in this article,
we primarily show data for the Si/C composite particles obtained at
700 °C, as there were no significant differences between the
materials. The Si content after carbonization was determined by TGA
to be ≈60 wt % (Figure S1).

Structure
and Composition
The Si/C composite particles
after synthesis and subsequent heating at 700 °C were investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 1a shows a typical bright-field image, indicating
that the particles are polydisperse. The average particle size from
counting ≈300 particles was (28 ± 9) nm (Figure S2a). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM, Figure 1b) revealed an amorphous-like
shell covering the Si particles. Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) mapping
using the Si K and C K absorption edges (Figure 1c) confirmed the presence of a relatively
homogeneous, nanometer thick layer, which is carbonaceous in nature.
High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-scanning TEM (STEM) coupled
with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis was also
performed, demonstrating that apart from both Si and C, O is also
present in the sample (Figure 1d). Such oxygen is likely due to the native oxide layer on
the Si particles. The integrated EDX spectrum of the acquired data
indicates that the oxygen content is below 3 wt % (Figure S2b).

box in (a). (c) EFTEM image indicating the presence of a carbon shell.
Si and C are shown in red and green, respectively, in (c). (d) HAADF-STEM
image and EDX maps of Si, C, and O for the area denoted by the solid
red box.

For further characterization of
carbon coating, Raman spectroscopy
was used (Figure S3a). Pristine Si particles
produced a distinct band at ≈515 cm–1 and
a series of weaker multiphonon bands in the range of 200–1000
cm–1. The same Raman bands were also observed for
the Si/C composite particles. In addition, there were broad bands
at ≈1350 and 1600 cm–1, which can be clearly
assigned to the D and G modes of turbostratic carbon from the surface
shell. The lateral extent of the graphene layers can be estimated
from the ratio of the integrated band intensities.22,23 Consistent with expectations, the degree of carbonization, and thus
also of crystallinity, increased with heating temperature (Figure S3b,c).

Furthermore, the pristine
Si and Si/C composite particles were
analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S3d). The patterns obtained are basically identical, displaying reflections
typical of cubic Si with space group Fd3®m. Overall, this means that coarsening and grain growth effects can
be ruled out. Besides, the fact that no carbon features are visible
in the pattern of the Si/C composite sample corroborates the disordered
(low crystalline) structure of the polymer-derived carbon shell.

Cycling Performance
Electrodes with areal loadings
ranging from 1.2 to 2.2 mgSi cm–2 were
prepared using both the Si/C composite particles and pristine Si particles
for comparison. Because fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) has been shown
in the past to have a positive effect on the cycling performance of
especially alloying and conversion-type electrode materials, 1 M LiPF6 in a mixed solvent of FEC and ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)
was used as the electrolyte in the electrochemical testing of Li cells
or, in other words, half-cells with a Li counter electrode. After
two formation cycles at a rate of C/20 (1C = 4008 mA gSi–1) in the potential range of 1000–10 mV
and another three cycles at C/10 between 600 and 30 mV were completed
(constant current–constant voltage (CCCV) cycling to electrochemically
address the bulk of the electrode and to form a proper solid electrolyte
interface (SEI) layer), the cells were cycled at C/2 in the CCCV mode
in the latter potential range. A rate performance test was implemented
after every 25 cycles (CCCV lithiation at C/2 and constant current
(CC) delithiation at different rates of 1C, 3C, and C/10). A detailed
description of the cycling protocol used can be found in Table S1.

Figure 2a shows a comparison of the capacity retention
between the Si/C composite particles and the pristine Si particles
at an average loading of 1.2 mgSi cm–2. During the first lithiation cycle, specific capacities of >4200
mAh gSi–1 were achieved for both the
coated and noncoated Si-based electrodes, exceeding the theoretical
specific capacity of Li15Si4 (3579 mAh gSi–1) and Li21Si5 (4008
mAh gSi–1). This is probably due to SEI
formation and side reactions with the native oxide layer, both of
which (irreversibly) consumes a fair amount of active Li, and thus,
is a major problem, especially in the full-cell where the cathode
is usually the Li source. Over the first 20 cycles, the cells exhibited
comparable cycling behavior, but then capacity degradation was observed
in the case of pristine Si particles. Though we do not have direct
evidence, we suspect that mechanical degradation and detachment of
Si particles, carbon black, and polymer binder from the electrode
lead to loss of electrochemical activity. The core–shell-type
structure of the Si/C composite particles apparently has a stabilizing
effect on the cyclability. The corresponding electrode retained a
specific (lithiation) capacity of ≈1800 mAh gSi–1 at the 100th cycle, compared to only ≈1250
mAh gSi–1 for the pristine Si particles.
As can be also seen from Figure 2a, the cell using the Si/C composite particles showed
much improved rate capability from the second rate performance test
(after 42 cycles) onwards. This is particularly evident at 1C (see
specific delithiation capacities in Figure S4)—the Si/C composite-containing cell delivered specific capacities
of about 2 times higher than with the pristine Si particles. By contrast,
the overall performance at the 3C rate was similar. The specific capacity
dropped immediately to below 200 mAh gSi–1, indicating that the materials employed here are not suited for
high-power applications, as somewhat expected.

Figure 2 Electrochemical cycling
performance of half-cells with the FEC-based
electrolyte. (a) Specific lithiation capacity of pristine Si particles
(black) and Si/C composite particles (orange). The areal loading was
1.2 mgSi cm–2. (b) Areal capacity achieved
with electrodes using Si/C composite particles of different loading:
1.2 (orange), 1.9 (light brown), and 2.2 mgSi cm–2 (dark brown).

Furthermore, electrodes
with a higher loading of the Si/C composite
particles were tested. The areal capacities achieved over the first
200 cycles are shown in Figure 2b. The electrode with the highest loading exhibited an initial
(lithiation) capacity of >9 mAh cm–2. However,
in
this case, more pronounced fading was observed with prolonged cycling.
After 80 cycles, the electrodes with 1.9 and 2.2 mgSi cm–2 revealed similar areal capacities of ≈3 mAh
cm–2, and after ≈180 cycles, the low-loading
electrode even outperformed the high-loading one. This finding demonstrates
that the capacity decay rate is strongly dependent on the active material
loading.

The effect of carbonization temperature on the cyclability
is shown
in Figure S5. Interestingly, the Si/C composite
particles after heating at 700, 800, and 900 °C exhibited very
similar cycling performance during the first 100 cycles, delivering
more or less the same specific capacities. However, slightly better
capacity retention and kinetics were observed in the later cycles
for the 900 °C sample (e.g., ≈180 mAh gSi–1 difference in specific lithiation capacity between
the Si/C composite-containing cells at the 200th cycle), which seems
to be due to subtle changes in the properties of the carbon shell,
caused by progressive carbonization.

Volume Expansion
One of the key challenges of Si as
a negative electrode material is to effectively accommodate the volume
changes during battery operation. The large expansion and contraction
with alloying and dealloying, respectively, leads to accelerated mechanical
degradation (anode self-pulverization) and SEI instability (continuous
electrolyte decomposition), and therefore ultimately to cell failure.
The volume changes have been studied in the past using various methods
such as XRD—by comparing the unit cell volume of cubic Si and
Li15Si4—resulting in a total expansion
of ≈280%.24,25 XRD, in particular, is well suited
to evaluate structural differences between crystalline phases, but
it cannot be used to determine volume changes of practical electrodes,
containing carbon black additive and polymer binder in addition to
the Si anode active material. The volume changes of Si nanopillars
with a height of 100 nm and diameters ranging from 100 to 1000 nm
were analyzed via atomic force microscopy (AFM).26 For pillars of diameter >200 nm, a total volume expansion
of ≈300% was observed, whereas 100 nm diameter pillars showed
volume changes below 200%. This study focused on the basic properties
of Si upon alloying with Li, but again, it did not consider the effect
of other electrode constituents or architectures on the “breathing”
behavior. By contrast, Breitung et al. conducted in situ AFM measurements
on practical Si electrodes,27 revealing
a strong increase in electrode thickness (height) during the initial
lithiation cycle. With further cycling, only minor volume changes
were observed. In fact, it might well be that the electrode height
remains largely unaffected after the first cycle, whereas the Si particles
in the bulk of the electrode still undergo volume changes, which cannot
be detected by AFM, though. Further results were obtained by Tranchot
et al. by measuring thickness variations using dilatometry. They found
that electrodes with 85 nm Si particles experience much larger expansion
(>300%), with higher irreversibility of the volume changes after
the
initial cycle, than electrodes with 230 nm Si particles (<150%).28 However, a drawback of the method is that the
measurement itself is confined to changes in only one dimension. This
is unfavorable, especially when considering that the volume expansion
of Si particles is accommodated to some extent by the electrode’s
porosity.29

In situ pressure measurements
are a viable alternative for monitoring three-dimensional volume changes
over many cycles.5,30 Here, a pressure sensor is connected
to a custom cell of known headspace volume. Upon cycling, the volume
changes of the Si electrode affect the headspace volume, thus leading
to periodic pressure changes—after subtraction of irreversible
contributions due to gassing. The measured pressure changes are ultimately
the sum of the individual contributions of anode and cathode. For
this reason, in the present work, (prelithiated) Li4Ti5O12 (LTO), a well-known “zero-strain”
material, served as the counter electrode.31 In addition, a lithium reference was used to precisely determine
the potential of the Si working electrode. For some unknown reason,
the FEC-based electrolyte interfered with the lithium reference, which
is why the experiments were performed using the LP57 electrolyte. Figure 3 depicts the volume
changes of the Si/C composite-containing electrode (after a couple
of cycles in the CC mode when the capacity had leveled off), with
lithiation capacities of 1850 mAh gSi–1 on average. As is evident, the total volume expansion amounts to
≈170%. Interestingly, the ΔV versus t curve is rather featureless and has a zigzag shape, with
the maxima and minima at the cut-off potentials, consistent with expectations.
Taken together, this indicates that the volume expansion/contraction
varies relatively linearly with specific capacity or, in other words,
Li content. More details and results can be found in Figures S6 and S7 as well as in Appendix S1, including potential profiles and pressure changes over
20 cycles, specific lithiation/delithiation capacities and corresponding
Coulombic efficiencies, and calculation of volume changes.

Figure 3 In situ pressure
analysis of a cell with three-electrode configuration
using prelithiated LTO, Si/C composite particles, and LP57 as the
cathode, anode, and electrolyte, respectively. Both the potential
profile of the Si working electrode vs Li reference at a rate of C/10
(light blue) and the corresponding volume changes (dark blue) are
shown for the 9th–11th cycles.

After cycling the cell for 20 cycles, the Si/C composite-containing
electrode was harvested in the delithiated state (≈650 mV)
and washed with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to remove any electrolyte
residues. Cross-sectional SEM images obtained on the electrodes before
and after cycling are shown in Figure S8. Apparently, the thickness did not change much (≈26 μm,
compared to ≈21 μm before cycling), but there are significant
differences in morphology and composition (Figure S9). Prior to cycling, the electrode had a rough and grainy
appearance, whereas it was relatively smooth with larger pores after
cycling. Besides, the electrode constituents were clearly covered
by an SEI layer. EDX mapping indicated that, in addition to O and
C, which were also present before cycling, the SEI consists of P and
F species from reductive decomposition of the supporting salt and
carbonate solvents at low potential.

Gas Evolution
Volume change effects during cycling
are always accompanied to some extent by the formation of new reactive
surfaces, leading to continuous electrolyte decomposition and thickening
of the SEI layer. As discussed previously, such processes cause gas
evolution, which was monitored in situ by means of differential electrochemical
mass spectrometry (DEMS). Figure 4 shows the potential profile of a half-cell with the
LP57 electrolyte using the Si/C composite particles and the gas evolution
profile of H2, C2H4, and CO2 detected with DEMS during the first five cycles (see also zoomed-in
view in Figure S10). The cell was cycled
in the CC mode at a rate of C/10. After the initial cycle with upper
and lower cut-off potentials of 1.0 V and 10 mV, respectively, was
completed, the cell was cycled in the range of 600–30 mV. The
main gaseous species evolved were H2 (m/z = 2) and C2H4 (m/z = 26). However, small amounts of CO2 (m/z = 44) were also detected.
For clear identification of C2H4, mass signal m/z = 26 was used. The reason is that m/z = 28 may be affected by fragments of
CO2, CO, and/or N2. The highest evolution rates
of H2 and CO2 were observed in the first 3 h
of lithiation, during which the Si electrode potential decreased rapidly
from ≈3.0 V to below 100 mV. The main source of H2 formation is probably the reduction of trace H2O, originating
from the electrode, electrolyte, separator, and the different cell
parts. In later cycles, H2 was always detected during lithiation,
with a subtle maximum around 110 mV, whereas virtually no H2 evolution took place during delithiation. C2H4 evolution usually accompanies ethylene carbonate (EC) reduction
and is indicative of SEI formation on graphite.32−34 The highest
evolution rate of C2H4 was observed in the first
lithiation cycle when the major part of the SEI is formed. After the
first full cycle, slightly higher rates were detected upon lithiation
than delithiation. The increase in the C2H4 evolution
rate was nearly linear until a potential of ≈70 mV was reached
(close to that of the H2 maximum), and then, it leveled
off and finally decreased rapidly with beginning of the delithiation
cycle. CO2 evolution was detected as well, with rates an
order of magnitude lower compared to C2H4. After
the initial cycle, the highest evolution rates were seen at the upper
and lower cut-off potentials. Some (minor) CO2 was identified
in the past as a side product of the reductive decomposition of EC/EMC-
and EC/DMC-based electrolytes on graphite.33,35 We believe that similar, if not the same, processes occur in the
case of Si, especially when considering the comparable operating potential
range. Note that details about the gassing of FEC-based cells are
provided elsewhere.36,37

Figure 4 Cell potential at C/10 (light blue) and
evolution rates of H2 (yellow), C2H4 (green), and CO2 (red) during DEMS measurement on the
Si/C composite-containing
electrode. The cell was assembled with the Li metal and LP57 as the
counter electrode and electrolyte, respectively.

Particle Fracture/Mechanical Degradation
As mentioned
above, a direct result of the large volume changes of Si during Li
insertion/extraction with cycling is particle fracture and anode self-pulverization,
both of which can be studied by acoustic emission (AE) measurements.
To this end, half-cells with the LP57 electrolyte using the Si/C composite-containing
electrode were built and then cycled for five cycles. The cycling
protocol was similar to that used in the DEMS measurement, except
that the initial (formation) cycle was performed at a rate of C/20.
As is evident from Figure 5, the rate of events shows strong variations with cell potential.
Most hits were detected in the first cycle. Interestingly, there was
higher acoustic activity during delithiation than lithiation. This
finding is in contrast to studies by Tranchot et al.28,38 and Rhodes et al.,39 where more acoustic
events were observed upon lithiation. The high event rate during delithiation
may suggest high tensile stress. However, it should be noted that
the mechanical properties depend on the composition of the electrode
and the morphology and microstructure of the active material.13 With further cycling, a relatively weak peak
in the AE hit rate was observed at low potential in the lithiation
cycles (starting at ≈60 mV). During delithiation, hits were
detected more or less over the entire potential range, with the highest
rate close to the upper cut-off potential. Nonetheless, it can also
be seen from the data in Figure 5 that the AE activity decreased significantly with
cycling, indicating that most of the mechanical degradation (including
electrode restructuring) occurs in the first couple of cycles. Unfortunately,
data interpretation is nontrivial, as many different processes may
contribute to the measured AE such as particle fracture, electrode
cracking and delamination, or gas evolution to name a few.

Figure 5 Cell potential
(light blue) and AE hit rate (gray) during AE measurement
on the Si/C composite-containing electrode. The cell was assembled
with the Li metal and LP57 as the counter electrode and electrolyte,
respectively. The region close to the lower cut-off potential is highlighted
for clarity.

To evaluate the effect
of gas evolution on the measured acoustic
activity, cells using electrodes made of only Super C65 carbon and
polymer binder were studied in the chronoamperometry mode using DEMS
and AE measurements. The upper potential was set to 1.5 V and the
lower potential was controlled between 500 and 100 mV, while monitoring
gas evolution and acoustic activity, respectively (Figure S11). Both H2 and C2H4 evolution was observed at low potential, clearly originating from
electrolyte decomposition and trace H2O reduction. However,
potential-dependent acoustic activity was not seen in any of the experiments.
Thus, we conclude that, in the present case, gassing has no notable
effect on the measured AE activity. Additional experiments carried
out by cyclic voltammetry in the potential range between 3.0 V and
10 mV corroborate this (Figure S12).

Although AE measurements are very sensitive to mechanical deformation,
gassing seems to have negligible influence on the data acquired. This
result is in agreement with other studies, indicating that effects
related to gas evolution, if detected, exhibit significantly longer
rise times (up to 200 μs) than mechanical processes.38,40,41 Finally, we note that to distinguish
between different mechanical degradation mechanisms, the waveforms
and frequencies of all acoustic hits would need to be analyzed in
detail. This, however, is outside the scope of this article.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the successful preparation of
small-size Si/C composite particles from a novel polymer-coated precursor
material. Detailed evaluation through microscopic and spectroscopic
analysis showed that the powder sample after carbonization at 700
°C exhibits a kind of core–shell structure, with the surface
layer being turbostratic in nature. Despite the relatively low crystallinity
of the carbon shell, the Si/C composite outperformed battery cells
with pristine Si particles/Super C65 carbon blended electrodes in
terms of electrochemical cycling stability. Long-term cycling experiments
resulted in an ≈1.5 times higher specific capacity for the
Si/C composite particles after 200 cycles. The volume changes of the
Si/C composite-containing electrode during alloying and dealloying
with Li were studied in situ by pressure measurements. A total volume
expansion of ≈170% was observed when cycling in the voltage
range between 600 and 30 mV (with Qlith ≈ 1850 mAh gSi−1). Notably,
the volume varied virtually linearly with specific capacity. The associated
mechanical degradation was analyzed via acoustic emission measurements,
indicating a higher rate of events during delithiation than lithiation,
with most hits detected in the initial cycle. Furthermore, differential
electrochemical mass spectrometry revealed the evolution of H2, C2H4, and CO2 over several
cycles, thus providing indirect evidence of solid electrolyte interface
instability. The gas evolution rates showed different features, which
were thoroughly analyzed. Pronounced surface layer formation as well
as changes in the electrode structure and morphology during cell operation
were also confirmed by ex situ electron microscopy imaging and elemental
mapping analysis. Overall, the data presented in this work demonstrate
that core–shell structures of Si or SiOx composites hold promise for future energy storage applications,
possibly especially in combination with graphite.

Experimental
Section
Materials Synthesis
Si-based precursor material was
produced by heating a 1 L glass reactor equipped with a mechanical
stirrer, thermometer, and condenser in an oil bath. Monomer and initiator
solutions were added via two separate dosing units. Specifically,
Si particles (10 g, APS ≤ 50 nm; Alfa Aesar) were dispersed
in a 1:1 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate (227.5 g) under a N2 atmosphere and heated to 65 °C. N-Vinylpyrrolidone
(29.9 g), acrylic acid (13.0 g), 1-vinylimidazole (1.5 g), stearyl
poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate 1100 (SPEGMA 1100, 5.5 g), and
pentaerythritol triallyl ether (0.21 g) were dissolved in hexane/ethyl
acetate (187.5 g) and fed over a period of 3 h. Radical initiators
(Wako V65, 0.2 g and tert-butyl peroctoate, 2.3 g)
were dissolved in hexane/ethyl acetate (22.5 g) and fed over a period
of 5 h, and then, the polymerization was continued for 15 h at 75
°C. The reaction mixture was dispersed in acetone (500 mL), filtered,
and the solid product was washed several times with acetone to remove
residual hexane/ethyl acetate. Finally, the polymer-coated Si powder
sample was heated under an Ar atmosphere at temperatures of 700, 800,
or
900 °C in a tube furnace (RT 50-250/11 W/B410; Nabertherm). The
temperature profile of the heating process is depicted in Figure S13.

Electrode Preparation
Si electrodes were prepared by
water-based slurry coating of 75 wt % Si/C composite particles, 10
wt % carbon black additive (Super C65; Timcal), and 15 wt % poly(vinyl
alcohol) binder (Selvol 425; Sekisui) onto 18 μm-thick Cu foil
(Gould Electronics). Reference Si electrodes were prepared with 50
wt % pristine Si particles, 35 wt % carbon black, and 15 wt % polymer
binder. Super C65 electrodes were prepared with 50 wt % carbon black
(≈0.4 mgC cm–2) and 50 wt % polymer
binder.

Electrochemical Testing
All cells were assembled in
an Ar-filled glovebox ([O2], [H2O] < 1 ppm;
MBraun). Electrochemical testing was performed on coin-type cells
with the Li counter electrode (Ø13 mm, 600 μm thickness;
Albemarle Germany GmbH), glass fiber separator (Ø17 mm, Whatman
GF/D; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), Si working electrode (Ø13
mm, 1.2–2.2 mgSi cm–2), and 250
μL of 1 M LiPF6 (Kanto Denka Kogyo Co., Ltd.) in
a 1:1 weight mixture of FEC (Solvay) and EMC (BASF SE) as the electrolyte.

DEMS and pressure measurements were performed on custom cells.33,42 For DEMS, cells containing the Li counter electrode (Ø40 mm,
600 μm thickness), glass fiber separator (Ø42 mm, Whatman
GF/A), and Si working electrode (Ø40 mm, 0.7 mgSi cm–2) were used. Pressure analysis was performed on cells
with a Si anode (Ø40 mm, 0.56 mgSi cm–2), glass fiber separator (Ø40 mm, Whatman GF/A), and prelithiated
LTO cathode (Ø40 mm, 14.4 mgLTO cm–2; Sigma-Aldrich). In both cases, 600 μL of LP57 electrolyte
(1 M LiPF6 in a 3:7 weight mixture of EC and EMC; BASF
SE) were used. Note that both the LTO and Si electrodes had a hole
(Ø4 mm) in the middle for gas extraction reason, and a Li reference
electrode was used in these experiments.

AE measurements were
performed on CR2032 coin cells (Hohsen Corp.)
containing the Li counter electrode (Ø14 mm, 600 μm thickness),
glass fiber separator (Ø17 mm, Whatman GF/D), Si working electrode
(Ø12 mm, 0.7 mgSi cm–2), and 250
μL of LP57 electrolyte.

Prior to use, all electrodes were
dried under vacuum at 100 °C
for more than 10 h. The water content of LP57 and EMC was determined
by Karl Fischer titration to be <10 ppm. According to the supplier
(Solvay), the water content of FEC was <10 ppm.

Instrumentation
DEMS and pressure measurements were
performed using a BioLogic VSP-300 potentiostat. The open-circuit
voltage before cycling was recorded over a time period of 6 h. For
DEMS, a constant carrier gas flow (2.5 mLHe min–1, 6.0 purity) was used and the evolved gasses were analyzed by a
mass spectrometer (GSD 320, OmniStar Gas Analysis System; Pfeiffer
Vacuum GmbH). After each run, a calibration gas of known composition
was introduced into the mass spectrometer to convert ionic currents
into molar ppm values. More details can be found elsewhere.33,42 For pressure measurements, PAA33X-V-3 pressure sensors (Omega) were
used.

Electrochemical cycling was performed using a MACCOR Series
4000 (Tulsa) battery tester. For AE measurements, a BAT-SMALL battery
cycler (Astrol Electronic AG) was used. The AE device consisted of
a sensor, preamplifier, and data acquisition system (USB-AE Node with
AEwin software; MISTRAS Group, Inc.). A differential wideband sensor
(MISTRAS), with the operating frequency range between 125 and 1000
kHz and resonant frequency of 125 kHz, was fixed with silicon grease
on the current collector of the working electrode. A preamplifier
gain of 40 dB, an analog filter of 20–1000 kHz, and a sample
rate of 5 MHz were used. AE activity was registered when a hit signal
exceeded the threshold of 27 dB. AE signals of less than two counts
or with a peak frequency lower than 80 kHz were considered background
noise events, and thus, eliminated.

TGA data were collected
on a TG 209 F1 Libra (NETZSCH).

Raman spectroscopy was performed
at a wavelength of 532 nm using
an inVia confocal Raman microscope (Renishaw).

A Mo Kα1,2 diffractometer with a Pilatus 300K-W
area detector (DECTRIS) was used for powder XRD.

Specimens for
TEM were prepared by powder dispersion in EtOH using
an ultrasonic bath. The suspended powder was deposited on a Cu grid
with a holey carbon support film. TEM was performed using an FEI Titan
80–300 Cs-corrected microscope operated at 300 keV and equipped
with a Gatan 863 Tridiem imaging filter system.
