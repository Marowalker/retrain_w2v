Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a majority reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and acts as an essential role in pathological
and physiological processes. Therefore, the development of quantitative
detection of methods for H2O2 is necessary.
Here, we constructed of a novel simple fluorescence probe for detection
of H2O2 based on the excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer process. The probe utilized a phthalimide derivative
as the fluorophore and selected phenylboronic acid as the recognition
site for H2O2. In response to H2O2, the probe exhibited 63-fold fluorescence intensity enhancement,
a low detection limit (8.4 × 10–8 M), and large
Stokes shift (111 nm). In addition, the probe displayed high selectivity
for H2O2 over other ROS. Moreover, the probe
was successfully employed for imaging of H2O2 in living cells.

1 Introduction
As
a major member of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) family,
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays a key role in
host defense, proliferation, cell growth, and signaling pathways in
the physiological process.1−4 However, excessive H2O2 generation
results in certain diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, cardiovascular
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and inflammatory disease.5−8 On the other hand, H2O2 is also widely applied
to industry and day-to-day life including bleaching and disinfection.
However, the significant concentration of H2O2 in wastewater can be involved in severe oxidative damage in organisms.9 Therefore, the development of quantitative monitoring
methods for H2O2 is very meaningful.

Currently,
there is a lot of analytical approaches for detection
of H2O2, such as the electrochemical method,10 colorimetric method,11 mass spectrometry,12 high-performance
liquid chromatography.13 Though the above
methods work well for detection of H2O2, most
of them require destruction of cells or tissues and complicated preparation.
Thus, they are not suitable for application to the live cells. As
powerful tools for monitoring analytes, fluorescent probes are desirable
for detection of analyte biological samples because of their fast
response, high selectivity, good compatibility for biosamples, and
nondestructive analysis.14−23 To date, many fluorescent probes for monitoring H2O2 have been constructed, such as metal complexes,24 catechol,25 and boronate
ester.26 However, some of these fluorescent
probes are not satisfactory for detection of H2O2 because of their detection sensitivity.27 In addition, some of them have small Stokes shifts (<70 nm)28,29 that is a significant limitation toward biological applications
due to the interference from autofluorescence. The large Stokes shifts
can minimize self-quenching and thereby improve the detection accuracy.30,31 Thus, it is a great necessity to develop a simple fluorescent probe
with large Stokes shifts that avoided self-quenching for quantitative
detection of H2O2.

Phthalimide derivatives
with a typical excited-state intramolecular
proton transfer (ESIPT) process have been recognized as ideal fluorophores
in the design of probes owing to the large-fluorescence Stokes shift,
high quantum yield, good photostability, and biocompatibility.32 Herein, we presented a phthalimide-boronate
as the ESIPT-process fluorescence probe for detection of H2O2. The probe used 3-hydroxyphthalimide as the fluorophore
and boronate ester as the H2O2 recognition group.
In this probe, the ESIPT process would be blocked and thus could result
in fluorescence to be efficiently quenched due to the protection of
the OH moiety with benzyl boronic pinacol ester. However, oxidation
of the phenylboronic pinacol ester mediated by H2O2 would release the OH moiety and would recover its ESIPT process
in the molecule, which caused a fluorescence increase. Notably, the
probe displayed a large Stokes shift toward H2O2. Furthermore, the probe exhibited high selectivity and sensitivity
for detection of H2O2 over other ROS under mild
conditions. Moreover, the probe was successfully applied for fluorescence
H2O2 imaging in living cells with satisfactory
results, suggesting its value for practical application.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optical Properties
The spectroscopic
analysis of the probe BBD was carried out in PBS (pH 7.4, 50 mM, 50%
CH3CN as a cosolvent). In the presented absorption spectra
(Figure S1), no obvious absorption was
observed at 401 nm, but upon the addition of H2O2, one could find prominent changes in absorption at 401 nm, which
suggested the H2O2-triggered cleavage reaction
between H2O2 and probe BBD. Then the fluorescence
spectra of the probe for H2O2 also were investigated
in the absence and presence of H2O2. As expected,
the probe BBD displayed weak fluorescence due to the EISPT process
being blocked from the boronate ester moiety. With the introduction
of H2O2, the solution of probe BBD appeared
to have a strong green fluorescence at 512 nm (Figure 1). When the solution of probe BBD was incubated
with different concentrations of H2O2, the fluorescence
spectra of probe BBD exhibited changes. The fluorescence intensity
of probe BBD increased with the gradual addition of H2O2, and a plateau appeared when 4.5 equiv of H2O2 was added. Meanwhile, a wonderful linearity was exhibited
based on the plot between the fluorescence intensities at 512 nm and
H2O2 concentrations (0.0–45.0 μM),
and the detection limit was estimated to be 8.4 × 10–8 M, suggesting that the probe BBD has sensitivity for detection of
H2O2 (Table S1).
Furthermore, the probe BBD displayed a large Stokes shift (111 nm)
toward H2O2. The good linear relationship and
low detection limit demonstrated that the probe BBD was suitable for
quantitative detection of H2O2 in aqueous media.

addition of H2O2 in PBS (pH 7.4, 50 mM, 50%
CH3CN as a cosolvent); (b) linear relationship between
the fluorescence intensities at 512 nm and H2O2 concentrations (0.0–45.0 μM). Excited at 401 nm.

2.2 Selectivity Studies
To determine
its selectivity for H2O2, fluorescence responses
of probe BBD to other relevant species were investigated including
reactive oxygen species (H2O2, tBOO–, –O2, ·OH, ONOO–,ClO–, NO, and HNO) and ions (NO3–, NO2–, Fe3+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and
Ca2+). As shown in Figure 2, only the existence of H2O2 could
induce a significant fluorescence enhancement of probe BBD. However,
the other species resulted in negligible fluorescence changes. Those
results suggested that the probe BBD could be used for high-selectivity
detection of H2O2.

(b) and presence (a) of 45 μM H2O2 in
PBS (pH 7.4, 50 mM, 50% CH3CN as a cosolvent). Excited
at 401 nm.

2.3 Kinetic
Studies
The dynamic behavior
of probe BBD was recorded in the absence or presence of H2O2. As depicted in Figure 3, the probe BBD displayed negligible fluorescence changes
at 512 nm emission along with the time, which illustrated that the
probe BBD was stable in solution. Upon addition of 4.5 equiv of H2O2, the fluorescence enhancement was observed and
the maximum fluorescence value appeared at 26 min. These results indicated
that probe BBD has a fast response for H2O2.

(red) H2O2 (45 μM). Excitation at 401

2.4 Effect
of pH
In order to evaluate
the practicability of probe BBD under physiological conditions, the
effect of pH on the fluorescence response of probe BBD in the absence
and presence of H2O2 in various pH were examined
(Figure 4). It could
be seen that fluorescence intensities of probe BBD scarcely changed
in the pH range from 2.00 to 11.00. In the presence of H2O2, negligible fluorescence changes were observed at pH
2.00–5.00. However, there were notable changes for fluorescence
of probe BBD in the pH range from 6.00 to 11.00, which indicated that
the probe BBD could be used for monitoring H2O2 under physiological conditions.33

incubation with different species.

2.5 Response Mechanism
To further confirm
the sensing mechanism of probe BBD for H2O2,
the isolated product of probe BBD reacting with H2O2 was demonstrated by 1H NMR spectra (Figure S5). From the 1H NMR spectrum,
it could be seen that the reaction product of probe BBD with H2O2 was in good agreement with that of compound 1. On the other hand, when H2O2 was
added into the probe BBD, a mass peak at 277.1183 m/z was observed, which was consistent with that
of compound 1 ([M + H]+ = 277.2878) (Figure S6). Thus, according to these results,
the sensing mechanism of the probe BBD with H2O2 was confirmed in Scheme 1.

2.6 Cellular
Imaging
To inquire into
practical application of probe BBD, we first investigated its cytotoxicity
to HeLa cells with MTT assays. As shown in Figure S7, the survival of cells was more than 85% when the cells
were treated with the probe BBD (10 μM), which illustrated that
probe BBD has low cytotoxicity in living cells. Then the H2O2 imaging of probe BBD was carried out in living cells
(Figure 5). When cells
were pretreated with probe BBD (10 μM), weak fluorescence was
exhibited inside the cells. After addition of H2O2 for 30 min, a strong green fluorescence signal appeared. The results
suggested that probe BBD was able to image H2O2 in the living cells.

min. (c) Bright-field and (d) fluorescence images of HeLa cells preincubated

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple novel phthalimide-based
ESIPT-process fluorescent probe BBD for detection of H2O2. The probe is able to qualitatively detect H2O2 with an excellent linearity in a concentration range
from 0.0 to 45.0 μM through H2O2-induced
hydrolysis of aromatic boronic ester. Furthermore, the probe exhibits
a large Stokes shift, high selectivity, and sensitive response to
H2O2, which are beneficial for biological application.
Importantly, the probe has potential to detect H2O2 in living cells.
