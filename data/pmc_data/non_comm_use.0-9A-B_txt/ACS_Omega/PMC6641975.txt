Synthesis and studies of single crystals
of hybrid perovskite are
important for achieving a better understanding of the optoelectronic
phenomena occurring in this material and for improving ongoing applications.
Here, we report on the growth of micrometer-size single crystals of
methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) using the spin coating
deposition method on a quartz substrate. We studied the influence
of the rotation speed and the use of three different additives N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and 4-tert-butylpyridine on the crystal size and shape. The introduction
of an additive in the precursor solution is revealed to be very useful
for obtaining crystals with well-defined geometries and for decreasing
the amount of defects. In this way, high-quality single crystals that
sustain optical resonating modes were obtained and characterized by
transmittance and photoluminescence measurements.

1 Introduction
In
the last years, hybrid perovskites1,2 have attracted
a great interest because of their potential application in the field
of photovoltaics, where, in a reduced period of time, they reached
efficiencies over 22%,3 a value that exceeds
other emerging technologies, such as quantum dots, dye-sensitized
solar cells, or organic solar cells.4,5 These materials
have some advantages, such as ease of processing and low fabrication
cost. Their synthesis can be attained through various routes like
those based on solution1 and vapor-assisted6 methods. However, they also have some limitations,
such as poor stability or toxicity of the components. In this context,
delicate control over the crystal formation has been shown to play
a key role in the physical properties and therefore in the reproducibility
and efficiency2 of perovskite-based solar
cells. Here, we study the formation and the properties of hybrid lead
bromide perovskite single crystals. There are several methods for
the synthesis of single crystals, such as inverse temperature crystallization,7 antisolvent-assisted crystallization techniques,8 and top-seeded solution growth method9,10 among others. In this work, we used the spin coating method11−13 because it is fast, versatile, reproducible, inexpensive, and finally
it requires moderate amounts of reactant. Although the size of the
obtained crystals is in the micrometer range, they are large enough
to study their physical and chemical properties and could be used
to develop photovoltaic devices with appropriate grain size. In contrast,
most of the studies in this respect have been done in large single
crystals with millimeter size, which require long preparation time
and several processing steps.8,14

Although there
are many parameters of the spin coating method influencing
the formation of perovskites, such as rotation speed, annealing, concentration
of precursors, solvents, and atmosphere,15 among others, here we focus on the influence of the speed of rotation
and the admixture of three different additives to the basic precursor
compounds. Recent studies have shown that the use of highly miscible
low-vapor-pressure additives is very effective for improving perovskite
crystallization2,15,16 because they decrease the rate of evaporation of the precursor solution
solvent. On the basis of previous results concerning the preparation
of active layers of perovskite in photovoltaic devices, we selected
dimethylformamide (DMF) as the main solvent and three different additives
for the synthesis of single crystals. In general, all of the additives
have in common both the ability to be coordinated with the precursors
and a high boiling point. The first additive is N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP),2 which
at low concentration induces homogeneous crystal nucleation and growth,
favoring high reproducibility. It has a particularly high boiling
point (284 °C) and low vapor pressure. The second investigated
additive is 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP). Shi et al.
added this compound in the precursor solution, resulting in a better
crystallinity and a more homogeneous orientation of the crystals.
This is probably due to the coordination of such compound with the
Pb2+ atoms and its role as dispersing agent, which avoids
the formation of aggregates.16 Finally,
we consider dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as an interesting additive because
it can coordinate easily to the PbBr2 precursor.17

Optical properties are closely related
to the performance of photovoltaic
devices. Therefore, we have undertaken as a characterization strategy
of the crystals the study of their optical properties, particularly
photoluminescence and transmittance, at the single-crystal level,
using for that purpose a homemade setup7 that allows us to test their behavior as optical cavities.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Influence of Rotation Speed
and Additive
The synthesis procedure based on the spin coating
process, under
the specified conditions detailed in Section 4, produces well-isolated single crystals. Figure 1 shows the variation
of the average size of the obtained crystals (black dots) with the
speed of the spin coater under different conditions: (a) without additive
(NA) and with different additives (b) CHP, (c) DMSO, and (d) TPB.
The error bars correspond to the standard deviation of each value
obtained by statistical means (see Section 4). The as-synthesized crystals are polydisperse
in size, in some cases with a dispersion value of about 50%, regardless
of the rotation speed and precursor solution. However, in general,
the average size of the crystals decreases as the rotation speed increases,
following a law (gray curves) like (∝1/speedγ) with different values of the exponent γ, which are indicated
in the caption of Figure 1. Such law is typical for the thickness of a deposited layer
by spin coating, but with γ = 1/2. We think that the distinct
values of γ obtained for the crystal size stem from the fact
that the growth of the crystals includes different stages, where the
removal of the excess of solvent as a consequence of the centrifugal
force is followed by an evaporation process that increases the viscosity
and the precursors concentration. Nevertheless, the experiments indicate
that the quicker the solvent evaporation, the larger the number of
crystal nucleation points, which results in a reduced average crystal
size.

Figure 1 Average crystal size (dots) as a function of the spin coater rotation
speed for a precursor solution without additive (A) and with (B) CHP,
(C) DMSO, and (D) TBP as additive. The error bars correspond to the
standard deviation provided by statistical methods. The gray lines
correspond to fits of experimental data to functions like (∝1/speedγ), and the fitted values of γ are 1.3, 1.2, 1.2,
and 0.9 for (A)–(D), respectively.

We did not find any clear relation between the size of the
crystals
and the physical properties of the additives (Table 1, Section 4). Nevertheless, those solutions containing DMSO as
additive produced the largest crystals, specially at low rotation
speeds, whereas solutions with TBP as additive yielded the smallest
ones. It can be explained by considering the different ability of
coordination with Pb2+ and the solubility of the precursors.
Shi et al.16 indicated that the nitrogen
atom on TBP favors the coordination with Pb2+ with respect
to the oxygen atom on DMF, thus hindering the formation of large bulks
and aggregates and favoring, therefore, the formation of small crystals.
All of the above is relevant to the preparation of highly efficient
photovoltaic solar cells, considering that there is an optimum crystal
size depending on the device configuration, and in general, large
crystals are desired due to lower J–V hysteresis and less charge trapping and recombination
at the grain boundaries.18,19

Table 1 Properties of the Solvent and Additives
Used in the Present Study
Figure 2a–d
shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of methylammonium
lead bromide (MAPbBr3) crystals grown on quartz substrates
by spin coating at 1000 rpm, corresponding to samples NA, CHP, DMSO,
and TBP respectively. All of the samples contain well-isolated single
crystals that are pyramid-shaped in general. However, crystals having
other shapes, namely, rods and plates, grow as well, at the same time.
Plate-shaped structures are particularly interesting for testing the
properties of the crystals as photonic microcavities, as we will see
below. We found that, in general, the use of an additive in the precursor
solution produces crystals with better-defined geometries and with
less defects (Figure 2b–d) compared to those obtained without any additive (Figure 2a). This effect is
even more pronounced for the CHP additive, and it should be taken
into account for the study of the optical properties, which can be
strongly influenced by the geometry and structural defects of the
crystals.

corresponding to samples NA (a), CHP (b), DMSO (c), and TBP (d).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
(Figure 3) show that
all of the synthesized samples
have in fact a crystalline nature with a characteristic cubic structure
finger print (Pm3̅m).20 In contrast to samples NA and TPB, samples DMSO
and CHP show the appearance of (110) and (210) peaks, suggesting that
the crystals are highly oriented8,21 with the planes parallel
to the substrate. This feature occurs for all of the rotation speeds.
It is very interesting because it is well demonstrated that more oriented
domains of perovskites in photovoltaic devices increase their photocurrent
and therefore their final performance.22

and (d)TBP samples.

The photoluminescence
properties of the synthesized crystals were
found to be influenced by the type of additive used in the precursor
solution rather than by the rotation speed. Figure 4a–d shows optical microscopy images
at 40× magnification of samples NA, CHP, DMSO, and TBP, respectively,
for a rotation speed of 1000 rpm, and Figure 4e–h shows their corresponding photoluminescence
images. Optical microscopy images of all of the samples for all of
the studied rotation speeds can be seen in the Supporting Information
(Figures S1–S4).

The scale bars correspond to 200 μm.

Samples CHP and TBP yield a bright green photoluminescence
signal,
whereas samples NA and DMSO give, in general, less intense signals.
We attributed this effect to the amount of surface states produced
during the crystallization process, which act as nonradiative recombination
centers. This is an important result to be considered in future developments
because such centers are strongly influenced by environmental conditions
of moisture and light.23Figure 5A shows the optical absorbance
and Figure 5B shows
the normalized photoluminescence spectra of the sample areas of Figure 4. They are similar
to those of previous reports of hybrid lead bromide perovskites,24−26 but slight differences in the position of the peak maximum and the
asymmetry have arisen. Although samples NA and TBP yielded a quite
symmetric peak, with the maximum position at 535 nm, the peak maxima
for samples CHP and DMSO were red-shifted to 540 nm and they showed
some asymmetric features, which consist of shoulders placed at about
552 nm and in the range of ca. 555–600 nm. Although a complete
elucidation of these effects has not been achieved yet, we think they
are related to the aging of the surface or structural inhomogeneities
in the crystals24,26,27 and to light reabsorption mechanisms.28,29

2.2 Synthesis
of Rod-Shaped Crystals
Rod-shaped single crystals were found
in small amounts in sample
CHP, especially at low rotation speeds. We studied the influence of
the concentration of this particular additive in the precursor solution
on the crystal formation. Figure 6 shows representative optical microscopy images of
the obtained crystals for different CHP concentrations, from 5 to
60% v/v in DMF. Moreover, Figure 7B shows the variation of the average size of the crystals
and the ratio of rod/cuboid-shaped crystals with respect to the CHP
concentration. At low concentrations, square-like plates are dominant.
However, for increasing values of the CHP content, the formation of
wirelike structures is favored and the size of the plates is reduced.
This was attributed to the fact that CHP contains a significant apolar
region because of the cyclohexyl ring, thus inducing a preferential
direction of growth probably due to screw dislocation defects.30 A similar trend has been discussed for the preparation
of other 1D structures.31,32 On the other hand,
no significant variation in crystal growth has been observed in the
case of DMSO and TBP additives when their concentration was increased.

concentrations of CHP additive: (a) 5, (b) 15, (c) 25, (d) 50, and

where crystals grow differently: in rod- or cuboid-like shapes. (B)
Curves of average crystal size (black line) and rod/cuboids ratio

bars correspond to the standard deviation provided by statistical
methods.

The influence of the rotation
speed on the formation of rod-shaped
crystals was studied for the 5% CHP vol/vol concentration in DMF precursor
solution. As mentioned above, the growth of rod-shaped crystals is,
in general, favored by low rotation speeds. This indicates that low
evaporation rates of the solvent are required for them to be able
to grow. Such a formation process has been observed by using low evaporation
rates in the drop casting method (see video in the Supporting Information). Moreover, we have found a threshold
rotation speed, at about 1000 rpm, which defines two main regions
where crystals grow differently (Figure 7A,B). Most of the crystals, say 80%, grow
either in rod- or cuboid-like shapes depending on the rotation speed
region, low or high, respectively, where they were synthesized. An
explanation of this threshold value constitutes currently an object
of research.

2.3 Optical Properties of Single
Crystals
A good proof for testing the quality of a crystal
is its ability
to sustain optical resonant modes because such modes can be strongly
influenced by crystal defects. In general, the better the quality
of a crystal, the more pronounced are its optical resonances. However,
they also depend on other factors like the coupling of light, the
absorption of the material itself, and more importantly the geometry
of the crystal, particularly the size of the crystal compared to the
wavelength of light, and how its faces are orientated each other.
Resonant conditions should allow a kind of feedback cycle of light
inside the crystal, which is produced by multiple reflections at the
crystal faces and finally leads to an interference phenomenon. In
this way, a pyramid-shaped crystal is not expected to sustain any
resonance because of its intricate geometry. However, the parallel
faces of a plate-shaped crystal are optimum for producing Fabry–Perot-type
resonances.27Figure 8a shows the photoluminescence (black curve)
and the optical transmittance (red curve) spectra of a plate-shaped
crystal, which was synthesized at 800 rpm by using CHP as additive. Figure 8b shows an image
of the measured crystal obtained by optical microscopy. It has well-defined
parallel faces with dimensions of 20.64 × 21.62 μm2 in area and 1.5 μm in depth, as deduced from a modeling
process.33 As expected, interference ripples
appear in the transmittance spectrum in that range from where the
absorption of the material somehow diminishes, say about 550 nm to
longer wavelengths, thus confirming that the crystal itself can work
as an optical microcavity, and it has a good structural quality. The
photoluminescence spectrum shows ripples as well, coinciding with
those of the transmittance spectrum, but they are less pronounced
because of differences between the envelope curves.33Figure 8c shows for comparison the transmittance and photoluminescence spectra
of a pyramid-shaped crystal (Figure 8d), where no resonances could be detected. In any case,
it is interesting for future developments to take into account these
resonant effects at the single-crystal level, which in our opinion
could help increase the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells.

3 Conclusions
We have described the synthesis and characterization of single
crystals of MAPbBr3 prepared by a spin coating method at
different rotation speeds. In addition, we studied the influence of
three different additives previously used in high-performance inorganic–organic
hybrid perovskite solar cells. We observed that the use of additives,
particularly CHP, produces crystals with a better-defined geometry
and with less defects, compared to crystals obtained without any additive,
and at the same time, CHP and DMSO additives have a tendency to produce
more oriented crystals. Also, we showed that increasing the concentration
of CHP additive results in the formation of rods of MAPbBr3. Finally, we demonstrated that single crystals of MAPbBr3 prepared by this methodology can behave as resonating cavities.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The
precursors lead bromide
(PbBr2) and methylammonium bromide (MABr); the main solvent
dimethylformamide (DMF); and the three additives N-cyclohexyl-2-pyrrolidone (CHP), 4-tert-butylpyridine
(TBP), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
They were used as received. Table 1 summarizes the physical properties of the solvent
and additives.

4.2 Synthesis of MAPbBr3 Perovskite
Single Crystals
Precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving
stoichiometric mixtures of 1 M MABr and 1 M PbBr2 in DMF,34 namely, 120 mg of MABr and 370 mg of PbBr2 in 2 mL of DMF. In the case of solutions containing an additive
(CHP, TBP, or DMSO), 20 μL thereof was added into 380 μL
of the precursor solution, resulting in a concentration of about 5
vol %. In addition, for CHP, the concentration was increased to obtain
solutions with 15, 25, 50, and 60 vol %.

MAPbBr3 crystals
were grown by a spin coating process on quartz substrates of area
≈ 1 cm2. To increase the hydrophilicity of the surface,
the substrates had been previously treated with hydrochloridric acid
and cleaned with acetone and isopropanol, followed by exhaustive rinsing
with distilled water. The spin coating process was performed at room
temperature and in a controlled nonoxidizing atmosphere at different
spin speed rates, in the range of 600–5000 rpm. In all of the
synthesis experiments, a volume of 20 μL of precursor solution
was dropped in the middle of the substrate before the rotation process
had started. Then, the spinner was turned on, producing a homogeneous
distribution of the precursor solution through the substrate, thus
favoring the efficient removal of the solvent and giving rise to the
formation of crystals. We kept the rotation process on for 2 min,
and after that, the substrates containing the as-grown crystals were
annealed for further 2 min at 90 °C so as to remove completely
any rest of solvent.

4.3 Optical Microscopy and
Photoluminescence of
Polycrystalline Samples
General views of the as-grown crystals
were obtained at different magnifications by an optical microscope
(Leica DM4000). It includes a module for fluorescence characterization,
which consists of a mercury lamp and a Leica bandpass filter (340–380
nm) as illumination source, and an Avantes AvaSpec-2048 Fiber Optic
Spectrometer, which provides a resolution better than 0.5 nm. Photoluminescence
of sample areas containing many crystals were obtained by using this
setup.

4.4 X-ray Diffraction Experiments
X-ray
polycrystalline film diffraction patterns of the samples were collected
by a Bruker D8 Advance A25 X-ray diffractometer operating at 45 kV
and 80 mA Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) equipped
with a LYNXEYE XE 1-D detector. It records the diffraction signal
of an area of 3 mm × 3 mm. No signals from the quartz substrate
were detected.

4.5 Optical Characterization
of Single Crystals
The optical properties, specifically photoluminescence
and transmittance,
of single crystals were obtained by means of a homemade setup (see Figure 9). Basically, it
includes two branches, one for excitation and the other one for collection
purposes, both focused by 20× Mitutoyo objectives at the same
spot, with a typical size of about 1 μm. In the experiments
reported here, both branches were oriented so that the collected light
was in forward direction with respect to the incident or exciting
light. The collection branch includes an iris, where the spot is focused.
It allows selecting the signal from a sample area of micrometer range
and even submicrometer range. After the iris, a motorized mirror drives
the signal either to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, by means
of which, the exact part of crystal being examined can be visualized,
or to a spectrometer (iHR320-HORIBA), which is equipped with a liquid
nitrogen refrigerated Si-CCD, and it is used for measuring the spectrum
of the collected light.

Figure 9 Schematic representation of the setup used for
measuring the OT
and PL spectra, where the different acronyms are lens (L), beam splitter
(BS), spectrometer, and camera (CAM).

White light of a halogen lamp was used for transmittance
experiments,
whereas excitation light of 405 nm wavelength, provided by a solid-state
laser, was used for photoluminescence experiments. In all of the cases,
we worked with a moderate intensity of about 0.1 mW for avoiding fast
crystal degradation.

Two types of crystal geometries were measured:
pyramid- and plate-shaped
samples. In both cases, the crystal was oriented so that the largest
face of the crystal was perpendicular to the incident or collected
light.

4.6 Crystal Size Measurement Procedure
An optical microscope (Leica DM4000) was used to obtain a general
overview of the crystal size and shape. Three samples were synthesized
and studied for each speed/additive condition. Once the uniformity
of each sample had been guaranteed by analyzing different sample areas,
60–80 crystals therein were measured by using the ImageJ software.
We considered for each single crystal the sample area, which is parallel
to the substrate, and measured the length of one of its sides. In
those cases, where the area had a rectangular shape, like, for instance,
in rods, we measured the longer dimension. Histograms for each synthesis
condition were obtained by considering all of the measurements of
the three corresponding samples, which showed good reproducibility
without significant differences in any case. The crystal size parameter
was divided into five ranges in the histograms, and the obtained mode
and standard deviation values are plotted in Figure 1. Also, they are detailed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information.
