Because
of the antioxidant activity of vitamin C (Vit C) polar heads, they
can be used as a protective agent for fatty acids. Hence, the study
on the growth of Vit C/stearic acid (SA) mixed binary films at air–water
interface (known as Langmuir monolayer) and air–solid interface
(known as Langmuir–Blodgett films) is of paramount interest.
Although Vit C is situated at subsurface beneath SA molecules and
interacts via hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of Vit
C and SA, several Vit C molecules may infiltrate within SA two-dimensional
matrix at the air–water interface. The increased mole fraction
of Vit C (0.125–0.5) and the reduction of temperature (from
22 to 10 °C) of the subphase water result in an increase in the
amount of adsorbed Vit C at the air–water interface. The surface
pressure (π)–area (A) isotherms illustrate
that such inclusion of Vit C provokes a spreading out of Vit C/SA
binary monolayers, which leads to an alteration of different physicochemical
parameters such as elasticity, Gibbs free energy of mixing, enthalpy,
entropy, interaction energy parameter, and activity coefficient. However,
being polar in nature, the transfer of pure Vit C on substrates gets
affected. It can be transferred onto substrate by mixing suitably
with SA as confirmed by infrared spectra. Their structures, extracted
X-ray reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy (topography and phase
imaging) are found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the substrate
(hydrophilic and hydrophobic).

==== Body
Introduction
In animal body, vitamin
C (Vit C) acts as an important nutrient.1 Besides, it plays a vital role in the production of collagen, an
important cellular component of tissue, muscles, teeth, bones, and
skin. Being an antioxidant, Vit C inhibits skin impairment triggered
by free radicals. In addition, Vit C has a detoxifying effect on liver.2 It also endorses healthy cell development, proper
calcium absorption, and cell restoration. However, it is well known
that Vit C is extremely unstable.1 For
example, it is highly sensitive to heat and degrades on illumination
of light, storage in unsuitable containers, and in the presence of
preservatives.3 Degradation of Vit C was
recognized by Yuan and Chen.4 Vit C is
destroyed throughout the food engineering and storage processes.3 To stop this degradation, Vit C is conjugated
with biocompatible fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid (SA)).1 Corvis et al. proposed that stearic acid (SA)
can protect Vit C from chemical reactions and thermal degradation.5 Hence, exploring the mechanism of binding Vit
C with SA is a lucrative topic of research. However, a proper and
reliable model of these interactions is not well established.

Molecules mixing at air–water interface experienced in a Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) trough provides a model system to explore the interactions involved
within the binary mixture.6 Notably, Vit
C is water-soluble, and hence, addition of hydrocarbon chains to the
ring results in amphiphilic molecules that show strong surface activity.7−9 Several works were performed on the interactions between Vit C derivatives
and various biomolecules.7,9−14 Mottola et al. reported an enhanced adsorption of ascorbyl palmitate
at air–water interface in the presence of a lipid monolayer.15 Zhang et al. reported the electrocatalytic activity
of self-assembled multiwall carbon nanotubes toward Vit C and dopamine.11 Vit C was found advantageous for selective and
sensitive determination of dopamine. It is established that pure Vit
C cannot make a stable monolayer at the air–water interface,
but its derivative of amphiphilic structure can produce a stable monolayer
and penetrate lipid membrane.9 Surprisingly,
the interaction of pure Vit C with fatty acid is less reported. Although
Vit C is surface-inactive at the air–water interface, our study
suggests that in the presence of fatty acids (such as SA), it forms
a stable monolayer at the air–water interface. Therefore, we
are interested to study the interaction involved in this interesting
phenomena and surface orientation of Vit C/SA mixture during the process.

In this paper, we explored the interactions of Vit C with SA at
the air–water interface by studying the pressure–area
(π–A) isotherms and their thermal stability.
This study is accomplished with a special focus on how Vit C can alter
the conformation of the SA Langmuir monolayer at various temperatures.
For a better understanding of temperature effect, we calculated the
physicochemical parameters such as elasticity, Gibbs free energy of
mixing, enthalpy, entropy, interaction energy parameter, and activity
coefficient of Vit C and SA, which have not been reported so far.
In addition, we reported the structure of Vit C/SA binary mixture
after transferring onto hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates forming
LB films. The structures of these binary films are determined using
X-ray reflectivity (XRR) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Results
and Discussion
Interaction at Air–Water Interface
Surface
Pressure–Area Isotherm of Pure Vitamin C and Stearic Acid
Figure 1 depicts
the typical surface pressure (π)–area (A) isotherm of pure SA and Vit C monolayers. SA provides a typical
condensed monolayer with a limit area (Alim) of 22 Å2/molecule and a threshold area of the condensation
(A0) (the area per molecule at π
= 1.5 mN/m) of 28 Å2, both values in agreement with
the values reported by Seoane et al.16 and
Parra-Barraza et al.17 The monolayer of
SA displays an appreciable change in slope at π = 24 mN/m, manifesting
a transition from the liquid condensed state to the solid state. We
recorded the isotherm beyond collapse pressure (πc). The collapse pressure of SA is found to be πc = 59 mN/m. The surface pressure of pure Vit C starts to increase
after a long compression. It implies that, because of its solubility
in water, Vit C exhibits a very small surface activity. With many
Vit C molecules immersed in subphase water, the apparent area per
molecule (<0.016 nm2) is found bizarre. To check the
reproducibility of the isotherm of pure Vit C, the π–A isotherm measurements were taken three times, which show
identical behavior.

Figure 1 π–A isotherm of pure vitamin
C (Vit C) and pure stearic acid (SA).

Surface Pressure–Area Isotherm of Vit C/SA Binary Monolayer
To study the adsorption behavior of Vit C with SA monolayer at
the air–water interface, we examined the π–A isotherms of SA by mixing different amounts of Vit C (XVit C = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50) at 22 °C,
which are depicted in Figure 2a. Phase transitions from gas phase to liquid phase and liquid
phase to condensed phase at πG–L = 1–1.5
mN/m and πL–S = 20–24 mN/m, respectively,
are observed. The collapse pressure πc decreases
appreciably with increase of XVit C (see Figure 2b).
This might be ascribed to the adsorption of Vit C with SA monolayer,
where Vit C propagates from the subphase water to the air–water
interface. Wydro et al.18 reported similar
results. Likewise, Gargallo et al.19 stated
that πc of poly(maleicanhydride-alt-stearyl methacrylate) reduced from 52 to 31 mN/m with the addition
of chitosan (3 g/L) in acetic acid solution (0.3 mol/L). But unsaturated
acids (e.g., oleic acid, linoleic acid, etc.) display the opposite
behavior. The drop of the slope of isotherms (see Figure 2) with Vit C mole fraction
indicates that SA becomes more fluidic or flexible with the incorporation
of Vit C. This can be attributed to the alteration of the orientation
of SA monolayers from perpendicular to lean as a result of a strong
interaction with Vit C. Such alteration provokes early collapse. Additionally
enhanced adsorption of Vit C with SA due to rise in mole fraction
from 0 to 0.5 initiates shifting of isotherm toward greater molecular
areas and inferior surface pressure values. Such expansion ratifies
that Vit C is proficient enough to absorb onto an SA monolayer. Vit
C is not completely ejected to the bulk water, rather it interacts
with SA polar heads at the subphase. However, several Vit C molecules
may attach with the polar carboxyl (−COOH) group of SA, which
modifies isotherm characteristics. A similar phenomenon was encountered
in our previous study on chitosan–fatty acid mixed monolayer.6

C/stearic acid (SA) as a function of mole fraction. (b) Evolution
of collapse pressure (πc) with Vit C mole fraction

Excess area and excess Gibbs free energy at certain surface
pressures are calculated to explore the interactions between Vit C
and SA molecules in the mixed monolayer. The plot of ideal area/molecule, Aid, and the experimentally determined area/molecule, A, with increasing mole fraction of Vit C in SA is shown
in Figure 3a. There
is a considerable deviation of A from the ideal case.
The excess area can be deduced from the difference between the experimentally
determined area/molecule (A) and the ideal area/molecule
(Aid),20,21 that is 1  where  Molecular interactions between two constituent molecules within a
binary system can be realized by studying the departure from the ideal
mixing line. Usually, Aexc can be used
for elucidating different molecular interaction and lateral packing
as an important physical parameter as well. Figure 3 shows the molecular area as a function of
Vit C mole fraction for binary Vit C/SA monolayers on water subphase
at representative surface pressure. The solid lines show that the
two components are mixed with effective states. The dash-dotted lines
present that the two kinds of components are “ideal mixtures”
with theoretical area or immiscible. As linearity between experimental
molecular area and mole fraction does not hold, Vit C/SA monolayers
are considered to be miscible and interact with each other, the nonideal
monolayers formed at the interface. The excess area Aexc takes its highest value for 0.5 mole fraction of Vit
C (shown in Figure 3a). It varies from 24 to 26 Å2 with increase in pressure
from 1 to 5 mN/m. However, the excess Gibbs free energy, ΔGexc, for the mixed monolayer at a certain surface
pressure is evaluated by integrating the total excess area over pressure
as follows22 2  where Na is Avogadro’s number. A minus sign
of ΔGexc for a mixed monolayer suggests
that the interactions are attractive in nature, whereas a positive
value corresponds to repulsive interactions. Figure 3b illustrates ΔGexc for various mole fractions of Vit C. The mixed monolayer
exhibits positive values for all of these cases with maximum at XVit C = 0.5. It implies that repulsive
interactions are dominant among Vit C and SA in the mixed monolayer.
Hence, these two components may find difficulty in mixing homogeneously.
The extent of interaction increases with the increase of mole fraction
of Vit C.

ideal area per molecule Aid (dash-dotted
line) with mole fraction of Vit C in Vit C/SA binary system at π

To characterize and elucidate the details of the influence
of Vit C on the physical state of fatty acid monolayer, the compression
modulus Cs–1, which
is inverse of the compressibility (Cs),
of the binary films was calculated. From π–A isotherms, we obtained Cs–1, which is defined as 3  It is also known
as equilibrium in-plane elasticity. Cs–1 is obtained by numerical calculation of the
slope of the π–A isotherms23,24 and plotted against area A (see Figure 4a) and surface pressure π
(see Figure 4b). The
modulus is zero, corresponding to clean air–water interface,
and increases with the mole fraction of Vit C present at the interface.
In addition, the value of compression modulus depends on the state
of the film, being larger for more condensed monolayers. The presence
of Vit C is found to affect the elasticity/compressibility of SA monolayers,
as depicted in Figure 4. The pure SA monolayer yields a large elasticity with compression.
But a radical drop of elasticity after mixing with Vit C is encountered.
Elasticity attains its maximum value around 30–50 mN/m for
pure SA, whereas in binary monolayer, the maximum is observed in the
pressure range of 25–50 mN/m. At low surface pressures (i.e.,
large area/molecule), the elasticity is similar for pure and mixed
monolayers, whereas at high pressure, they differ from each other
significantly. Therefore, the effect of Vit C on the in-plane elasticity
of Vit C/SA mixed layer is substantial. So, an effective interaction
of Vit C with fatty acid is encountered at the air–water interface
even though Vit C has less surface activity. Furthermore, hysteresis
(i.e., compression–decompression cycle) measurements (see Section S1, Supporting Information) were performed
to explore the reversibility. A very small hysteresis is detected
for the monolayer having a higher concentration of Vit C. It implies
that the monolayers are irreversible to some extent.

mole fractions of Vit C.

Temperature-Dependent Isotherm of Mixed Monolayer
Isotherms
of Vit C/SA mixed monolayer are measured with varying temperature
from 22 to 10 °C keeping the other experimental parameters same
as shown in Figure 5a. The depression of the temperature of subphase water makes a very
little expansion of area/molecule. The limit area (Alim) is increased from 23.4 to 24.3 Å2/molecule, and πc decreases from 53 to 48 mN/m.
The elasticity (shown in Figure 5b) is found to drop from 4800 to 3202 mN/m, indicating
the incorporation of additional soft Vit C molecules. However, the
incorporation of Vit C facilitates the subtle expansion of binary
monolayer (of 1 Å2 only) and the small reduction of
πc and Cs–1. This expansion can be attributed to the change in the solubility
of Vit C with temperature. A similar expansion along with enhanced
surface activity and elasticity of pure Vit C is observed (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). An analogous
phenomenon was encountered by Neto et al.25 and Shalmashi et al.26 They proposed
that the mole fraction solubility N of Vit C varies
with temperature (T in kelvin) as follows: ln N = A + BT, where A and B are the parameters dependent on
solvent nature. For water subphase, it was found that the values of A and B are ≈−11.7 and ≈0.028, respectively.
Therefore, substituting these values, one can extract the values of N at different temperatures. The calculated values of solubility
are found to be ≈0.032, 0.027, and 0.023 at T = 22, 16, and 10 °C, respectively. This implies that the cooling
down of subphase water minimizes the solubility of Vit C in water.
Essentially, Vit C molecules are expelled from the bulk and reside
near the air–water interface to take part in the evolution
of the surface pressure–area isotherm.

Vit C/SA (XVit C = 0.125) mixture

elasticity of Vit C/SA mixed monolayer.

For spreading of monolayers, the Gibbs free energy of spreading,
ΔGs (kJ/mol), and surface entropy,
ΔSs (kJ/(mol K)), can be calculated
according to the formulas 4   5  where π0 is the
maximum pressure at which the integral is calculated. Furthermore,
if ΔGs and ΔSs are known, then surface enthalpy ΔHs (kJ/mol) can be easily determined as 6  The calculated values of ΔGs, ΔSs, and ΔHs for mixed binary monolayers are tabulated in Table 1 for three different values of π and A. Notably, ΔGs values
are always positive irrespective of temperature and surface pressure,
mimicking repulsive interactions between Vit C and SA molecules at
the air/water interface. ΔGs increases
monotonically with the decrement in T. The ΔSs and ΔHs values
regularly increase with the decrement in temperature as a result of
the higher flexibility of Vit C/SA binary monolayer at low temperatures.
However, the entropy remains constant at higher area/molecule.

The interaction energy parameter ξ and activity
coefficient γi (i = Vit C, SA) of Vit C and SA in
the binary monolayer can be evaluated as well from the values of ΔGexc. Both ξ and γi are
two important parameters for quantitative analysis of the thermodynamic
properties and stability of monolayers. According to Kodama et al.,27,28 ξ can be obtained using the following equation 7  whereas activity
coefficient γi can be evaluated using the Margules
equations28 for given binary monolayer
systems as follows   8  where ξ is the
interaction parameter, which is ascribed to cohesive interaction between
dissimilar molecules.29 The negative sign
of ξ indicates that the molecular interactions of the films
are more attractive than those of single component monolayer, whereas
the positive sign of ξ means phase separation and repulsion
force between SA and Vit C.30 The calculated
values of interaction parameter ξ for the binary systems are
depicted in Figure 5. The ξ values are found to be positive as ΔGexc values are positive. Generally, the interaction parameters
increase with surface pressures at all mole fractions, which implies
the intermolecular interactions between constituent molecules reinforced
with the improvement of surface pressure. Specifically, the higher
value of ξ corresponds to the stronger interaction, and its
composition dependence is related to the packing of one molecule surrounded
by other molecules.31 The interaction energy
parameter ξ values at 5 mN/m progressively increase with XVit C, indicating that the increase of
Vit C molecules produces a strong repulsive interaction with SA molecules.

In thermodynamics, activity coefficient is used to determine the
nonideal behavior of a mixture or departure from ideality as predicted
by Raoult’s law.32 Physically, it
describes the escaping tendency of the constitutive molecules from
the mixture. So, if the activity coefficient is less than 1.0, it
indicates that the molecules have strong attractive force, and therefore,
a high energy is required to isolate them. Conversely, when the activity
coefficient is greater than 1.0, it implies that the molecules have
a strong repelling force. In this case, lesser energy is needed to
separate the constituent molecules. However, it is evident from Figure 6 that γSA increases with XVit C,
whereas γVit C decreases with XVit C. The values of γVit C decrease from 1.62 to 1.35 with the increase of XVit C from 0.125 to 0.5, particularly at π
= 5 mN/m, whereas γSA increases from 1.01 to 1.35
at π = 5 mN/m. So, all of the values of the activity coefficient
(shown in Figure 6b)
lie above 1, which suggests that repulsive interactions exist in Vit
C/SA binary system irrespective of Vit C mole fractions.

Structure of Langmuir–Blodgett Films
LB films of mixed monolayer were grown on hydrophilic native oxide-covered
Si and hydrophobic H-terminated Si in one (up) and two (down–up)
strokes, respectively, at a surface pressure (π) of ≈30
mN/m. As native oxide is polar in nature,33 deposition was made in upstroke (one stroke) sequence starting from
the bottom of water subphase. In contrast, we followed reverse sequence,
that is, down–up (two strokes) for apolar H-terminated Si.

X-ray
Reflectivity Study
To analyze the structure of LB films of
Vit C/SA hybrid monolayer, we performed XRR measurements, which provide
electron density profile (EDP) along depth. By knowing this structure,
one can understand the growth mechanism and find the way of relocating
Vit C on solid surfaces of different kinds. XRR data and analyzed
curves for three binary LB films deposited on hydrophobic and hydrophilic
surfaces are shown in Figure 7. A layered structure is evident for all of the films on both
the surfaces, but their height and coverage differ drastically. However,
to get the quantitative information about the layering, all of the
XRR data were fitted by considering a truthful model structure and
the corresponding EDPs are given in their insets. For the fitting,
each film is divided into different boxes or layers. Each box or layer
has a constant density, and roughness is incorporated at each interface.

Figure 7 XRR data
(different symbols) and analyzed curves (solid line) of Vit C/SA hybrid
LB films on (a) hydrophilic and (b) hydrophobic Si(100) substrates,
deposited by one and two strokes (shown by arrow), respectively, at
the surface pressure π = 30 mN/m (the curves are shifted vertically
for clarity). Inset: corresponding EDPs showing possible model structures
of LB films.

EDP indicates a drastic
density variation along depth, which leads to an overall two-layered
structure in all of the LB films. The bottom layer (designated as
Lbot) adjacent to the interface is found denser than the
top overlayer (designated as Ltop). The density profile
illustrates that the electron densities of the bottom layer (ρbot) and the top layer (ρtop) of binary films
grown on hydrophilized Si vary around 0.40 and 0.30 e/Å3, respectively. The high density of Lbot can be attributed
to the presence of a largely dense Vit C (mass density ≈1.65
g/cm3) compared to SA (mass density ≈0.94 g/cm3). These layered structures are not expected from pure SA
on hydrophilic Si in one stroke (up) at π = 30 mN/m, rather
a homogeneous monolayer is likely to be formed.7 Although bilayer structures of pure SA are expected to
be formed on hydrophobic Si in two strokes, their densities would
not differ much and the quality would be good. Hence, in the present
study, the interaction between Vit C and SA provokes the bilayer formation.
On the other hand, it proves the adsorption of Vit C within the Langmuir
monolayer and LB films. However, the thickness of high density of
Lbot is ≈1.0 nm, whereas the thickness of Ltop is ≈1.5–2.0 nm. By looking at the thickness
of Ltop, it is evident that it does not correspond to a
layer solely, rather it represents a part of it. It is well known
that the thickness of an LB monolayer film made of pure SA is around
2.5 nm.34 The total thickness of the film,
Lbot + Ltop, is itself around 2.5–3.0
nm. Essentially, these two apparent layers are residing adjacent to
each other, otherwise the thickness of the film would be greater than
3.0 nm. Probably, Lbot corresponds to both Vit C and SA,
whereas Ltop corresponds to only SA. Notably, the excess
density (i.e., ρtop – ρbot = 0.1 e/Å3) appears due to the incorporation of
Vit C within the SA monolayer. It suggests that the thickness of Lbot is determined by the transferred Vit C molecules on Si
surfaces. On the other hand, a completely different EDP is encountered
for the LB film deposited on hydrophobic Si in two strokes (down–up
sequence). The thickness and density of Lbot are found
to be ≈2.5 nm and 0.34 e/Å3, respectively,
whereas the thickness and density of Ltop are ≈2.5–3.5
nm and 0.3–0.8 e/Å3, respectively.

Atomic Force
Microscopy Study
These structural information are also in
agreement with the AFM results. Two different features having different
heights constituting the bilayer structure are evident in the surface
topography images (shown in Figure 8a–f), although their morphologies are different
on polar and apolar surfaces. But these morphologies do not alter
appreciably with the mole fraction of Vit C. The basic difference
between the structures on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces is
that the two features reside side by side and one by one vertically
on the former (Figure 8d–f) and the latter ones (Figure 8a–c), respectively. The phase images
(see Figure S3, Supporting Information)
confirm these structures. Two distinct phase contrasts manifesting
Vit C and SA are observed in all of the films deposited on hydrophilic
Si. Heights and coverages obtained from AFM images (height as well
as phase images) are in good agreement with the EDP of the films.
Nevertheless, coverage of the films or layers is calculated from the
bearing plot of AFM images using Windows Scanning x Microscope (WSxM)
software. These results obtained from XRR and AFM eventually lead
to the model structure shown schematically in Figure 9.

Infrared Spectroscopy Study
To confirm the existence
of Vit C within binary films, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study
was carried out using Jasco FT/IR-6300 in the wavelength range of
350–4000 cm–1. Pure Vit C (drop-cast), pure
SA, and Vit C/SA (XVit C = 0.5) mixed
LB films on Si substrates displayed FTIR spectra (shown in Figure 10) featuring typical
bands of SA and Vit C. The assigned FTIR adsorption bands derived
from Figure 10 are
tabulated in Table 2. In the normalized transmission spectrum of Vit C, the absorption
bands appearing at 1762 and 1675 cm–1 are related
to C=O stretching of the five-membered lactone ring and C=C
stretching vibrations combined with the neighboring vibrations. Other
vibrational bands are detected in the wavelength range 1200–1500
cm–1, which originate from CH2 scissoring,
twisting, and wagging and the C–H deformation modes, which
are similar to those reported by Panicker et al.35 Particularly, the weak band at 1463 cm–1 is attributed to CH2 scissoring. The band at 1277 cm–1 is generated from C–O–C stretching.
In addition, very strong C–O–C stretches are visible
at 1142, 1113, and 1077 cm–1. Also, the C–O–H
band probably has contribution to the bands in the region 1046–1081
cm–1. The bands in the range 990–1027 cm–1 correspond to the deformation of lactone ring. The
peaks at 3526 and 3411 cm–1 are due to O–H
stretching. The strong peak at 3031 cm–1 is due
to C–H stretching. Intense bands in the region 3216–3529
cm–1 are assigned to O–H stretches due to
the presence of humidity in the sample.36 Two strong bands at 1706 and 721 cm–1 appearing
in the transmission spectra of SA are attributed to the stretching
vibration of C=O and the bending vibration of the hydrogen
bond (OH···H) of carboxylic acid. Both bands are characteristic
bands of carboxylic acid. In the transmission FTIR spectra of Vit
C/SA mixture, the transmittance dip gets broader in the range of 3153–2623
cm–1 in comparison to pure SA, probably due to the
effect of strong bands of O–H in the 3216–3526 cm–1 region of Vit C.

C, pure SA, and hybrid Vit C/SA films. The curves are shifted vertically

In the range
of 1000–1400 cm–1, the transmittance dip
is sharper than pure SA probably due to the presence of lactone ring
deformation bands of Vit C in 990–1027 cm–1. In comparison with the IR spectra of pure Vit C and SA, the Vit
C/SA spectrum showed some changes in the band spectrum and intensity,
although their positions remain fixed. Additionally, due to the presence
of Vit C, the bands at 1463, 1321, 1113, and 1023 cm–1 appear in the spectrum of mixture. Intense dips at 3526, 3410, and
3318 are vivid in the IR spectra of Vit C/SA, which can be attributed
to the stretching vibration of O–H of pure Vit C. Notably,
the sharp dip of pure SA at 1705 cm–1 gets shifted
to 1693 cm–1 and gets broadened due to the presence
Vit C. All of these results suggest that Vit C is present in the mixed
LB films.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that when Vit C ratio increases in Vit C/SA mixture,
it employs an in-plane compression-induced lateral displacement of
the SA molecules at air–water interface. This incorporation
leads to an expanded state that exhibits less compressibility and
collapse pressure. Existing literature only reports on the structure
and the mechanical properties of mixed monolayers encompassing Vit
C derivatives in the vicinity of room temperature. The present study
prolongs these properties of pure Vit C toward low temperatures (down
to 10 °C). Suppression of temperature of subphase permits added
number of Vit C molecules to populate the air–water interface.
Accordingly, a small increment in the average area per molecule is
observed. Additionally, the temperature drop leads to a rise in entropy,
enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy. On the other hand, thorough structural
information of transferred films on hydrophobic and hydrophilic Si
surfaces obtained from XRR and AFM shows that a bilayer film is formed
on the former substrate, whereas a monolayer is formed on the latter
surface. Although no appreciable difference in the structure and morphology
of monolayer films is observed with Vit C mole fraction, in the case
of bilayer films, the coverage of the top layer tends to decrease
with the increase of Vit C. Perhaps its random orientation in the
first monolayer of SA grown at the time of downstroke inhibits the
further attachment of SA molecules at the time of upstroke. The presence
of Vit C within binary LB films is confirmed from IR study. However,
the structures of films at several conditions are important to replicate
the ordering of the predeposited films at the air–water interface,
which essentially have insinuations in the biological applications
of human body.

Experimental Section
Stearic acid
(SA) (CH3(CH2)16COOH, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., 99%) and Vit C (l-ascorbic acid C6H8O6, Acros Organics, 99%, molecular weight ∼176.12
g/mol) solutions of concentration 50 mM were prepared in ethanol,
whereas Vit C/SA mixed solutions were prepared by mixing SA with Vit
C solutions homogeneously at three different mole fractions of Vit
C (XVit C = 0.125, 0.25, and 0.50).
Langmuir monolayer and LB film were prepared in a double-barrier Langmuir–Blodgett
trough (Apex Instruments, model no.: LBXD-NT). In the center of the
trough, a Wilhelmy plate was partially immersed in aqueous phase to
measure the change in surface tension with surface pressure. Before
proceeding any kind of experiment in an LB trough, it was thoroughly
cleaned with ethanol, followed by Milli-Q water (resistivity ∼18.6
MΩ cm) to make the trough totally dirt-free. For hybrid monolayer
study, three homogeneously mixed solutions having different mole fractions
of Vit C were spread dropwise using a Hamilton syringe (precision
of 2.5 μL). After pressure stabilization, surface pressure (mN/m)
versus area per molecule (nm2) (π–A) isotherms were recorded beyond collapse pressure (πc) at a constant compression speed of 10 mm/min. For thermal
stability study, the temperature of subphase water was decreased to
10 °C from room temperature using a chiller (FirstSource Company).
For comparison, the measurements were also performed on pure SA and
Vit C solutions. Furthermore, LB films were transferred at a constant
pressure π = 30 mN/m on hydrophilic and hydrophobic Si(100)
substrates in a single stroke (upstroke) and double strokes (down–upstroke),
respectively. During film deposition, the barrier compression speed
and the dipping/lifting speed of substrates were maintained at 8 and
5 mm/min, respectively.

Before LB deposition, Si(100) substrates
were cleaned extensively following Radio Corporation of America (RCA)
and hydrofluoric acid (HF) treatment methods.37 In the RCA treatment, Si surfaces (each piece size ≈22 ×
12 mm2) were boiled in a mixture of ammonium hydroxide
(NH4OH, Sigma-Aldrich, 25%), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Acros Organics, 39%), and Milli-Q water (H2O/NH4OH/H2O2 = 2:1:1, by volume)
for 10 min at 100 °C, which makes the surfaces hydrophilic due
to the incorporation of hydroxyl group (−OH) in the Si dangling.
In HF treatment, the RCA-cleaned dry Si were vertically dipped into
10% HF solution (every time volume was kept constant at 50 mL) for
3 min. The substrates were washed immediately in Milli-Q water for
removing the residues (if any) and dried by spinning them at a high
rpm (5000) in a spin coater. The qualities of hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity
were tested by water contact angle measurements, which yield ∼14
and 79°, respectively.33

XRR
measurements of all prepared films were performed at the beamline
MCX38 at Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste (selected
energy = 8 keV and wavelength λ = 1.54 Å). The beamline
is equipped with a high-resolution four-circle diffractometer (θ
– 2θ) and a three (X, Y, and Z) translational stage. Scattered intensities
were detected using a scintillator detector. XRR data were recorded
in a specular condition, that is, the incident angle is half the detector
angle and both are in a scattering plane. From the fitting of XRR
data, an average electron density (ρ) profile (EDP) along depth
(z) can be built.39 Notably,
EDP provides film thickness, electron density, and interfacial roughness
of films.39,40 Analysis of XRR data was carried out using
the matrix technique.39

Surface morphologies
of the films were imaged by an atomic force microscope (Asylum Research
MFP-3D) in noncontact mode, and scans (different scan ranges) were
executed at different positions on the films’ surface for good
statistical information. A sharp needlelike tip residing at the edge
of a silicon cantilever (Olympus RC-800 PSA, spring constant = 0.76
N/m, resonant frequency = 71 kHz) was used for scanning. For image
processing and analysis, Windows Scanning x Microscope (WSxM, where
x is force, tunneling, near-optical, etc.) software41 and Gwyddion software were used. The presence of Vit C
in binary LB films was confirmed by transmission Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements with a Jasco FT/IR-6300
spectrometer.
