A one-pot
greener methodology has been adopted for the synthesis
of a simple 4H-chromene core-based fluorescent tag
of (S)-2-amino-4-(anthracen-9-yl)-7-hydroxy-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (AHC), and its structure has been
analyzed using NMR spectroscopy. The physicochemical properties of
AHC were well-studied by UV–vis and fluorescent spectroscopy
techniques. As a result of excellent emitting property (ϕ ≈
0.75), it has been coupled with anti-AH through amide linkage, and
the AHC-tagged anti-AH has been used as an immunoassay for the selective
detection of Aeromonas hydrophila in
the presence of interfering pathogens. Under optimized conditions,
immunosensors could successfully quantify A. hydrophila from 4 to 736 CFU/mL, and the LOD was 2 CFU/mL. Saliently, the immunoassay
has been successfully demonstrated for the analysis of A. hydrophila in the organs of Oreochromis
mossambicusfingerlings, and results have shown a very
good agreement with our optimized neat AH fluorimetric titration results.

==== Body
Introduction
Genus of Aeromonas mainly consists
of oxidase-positive, facultative, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria;
among these disease-causing pathogen community, Aeromonas
hydrophila (AH) is noted as an important motile Gram-negative
bacillus pathogen which is mostly found in water sources, and it is
more pathogenic, especially for fish and other cold-blooded species.1 It is also pathogenic for both humans and animals.2−5 On the basis of the physiological and host properties, they are
mainly divided into two major groups. The first group which mainly
includes the motile aeromonads with AHas, a typical representative,
and the other group consists of nonmotile species, which is represented
by Aeromonas salmonicida.6Aeromonas species
are said to be pathogenic because of the production of a wide range
of extracellular enzymes and possess all of the requirements of pathogenic
bacteria through the production of flagella, pili, and adhesins.7,8 The main isolation source for the AH is food materials such as fish,
meat products, milk, and vegetables, which ranges from 102 to 105 CFU/g.9 The amount
of Aeromonas percentage in some food
products such as meat and poultry (3–70%), dairy products (4%),
and vegetables (26–41%) has also been reported. However, the
sea food (31–72%) is the major source for the isolation of Aeromonas-positive samples.10

The motile aeromonads with AH possess some virulence factors
including
hemolysins, aerolysins, proteases, adhesins, enterotoxins, phospholipases,
and lipases; simultaneously, the infections caused by this could lead
to gastroenteritis, septicemia, meningitis, respiratory, and hemolytic
uremic. As a consumer, human community has been receiving gastroenteritis
because of the intake of stressed or illn fish, and those who are
easily affected with this AH will also undergo hemorrhagic septicemia.11−15 In humans, the gastrointestinal tract carries the Aeromonas species in both of their symptomatic and
asymptomatic individuals. For nondiseased conditions, the rate of
fecal carriage ranges from 0 to 4%,16 whereas
for diarrheal illness, it ranges from 0.8 to 7.4%.17 Because of these adverse effects, people undergo so many
clinical diagnosis procedures to detect the pathogenicity of Aeromonas species, but it requires both sensitivity
and specificity.18,19

Culture-based detection
methods are generally used to grow Aeromonas species in differential isolation media,
and it has been developed for the recovery of Aeromonas species from the environment samples such as foods and clinical
specimens.20 EPA method 1605, membrane
filtration method, and culture enrichment have also been authenticated
for the isolation of AH from drinking water samples, foods, and so
forth.21,22 These methods are only focused on the isolation
of Aeromonas species from food and
water samples.

From the detection point of view, till date,
only polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) method has been mainly addressed for the recognition
of AH. A simple PCR method has been reported for the detection of
AH in raw milk within the limit of 2 log10 CFU/g, and the
detection rate was found to be 23% for this method and 14% for culture
method.23 In addition, some microarray-based
method is constructed using DNA probes to study the population dynamics
of microbial communities, such as marine bacteria in coastal waters
in which aeromonads were found to make up a large proportion of the
microbial flora.24 Another microarray method
has also been reported for the detection of AH cytotoxic enterotoxin-inducing
genes in macrophages.25−27 Some researchers have developed probes for the detection
of various Aeromonas species.28,29

The chromene moieties often appear as an important structural
component
in both biologically active and natural compounds. Chromene fragments
occur in alkaloids, flavonoids, tocopherols, and anthocyanins. Moreover,
functionally substituted chromenes have played increasing roles as
promising compounds in the field of medicinal chemistry.30−33

On the basis of deep tunneling of all reports for AH, let
us conclude
that no immunosensor has been reported so far for the detection of
AH in laboratory as well as in real samples. Among the already-reported
PCR techniques, DNA probe methods are used only for isolation and
to find the detection rate of AH and not for precise quantification.
These methods are costly, more time-consuming, and a lot of steps
have to be taken care of. On the basis of this, we assure that our
group is reporting for the first time about a fluorescent-based immunoassay
for the very selective and ultrasensitive detection of A. hydrophila. The 4H-chromenecore(S)-2-amino-4-(anthracen-9-yl)-7-hydroxy-4H-chromene-3-carbonitrile (AHC) was specially designed via a one-pot
greener approach using ultrasonication method with high yield in a
short time, that is, 20 min, and it was applied as a tag for the qualitative
and quantitative detection of A. hydrophila from 4 to 736 CFU/mL with an LOD of 2 CFU/mL, and the immunoassay
developed has been applied for the quantification of AH in the organs
of Oreochromis mossambicusfingerlings.

Results
and Discussion
Conformation of Tagging of AHC with Anti-AH
by UV–Vis
Spectra
In general, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) reagent
offers a very good coupling platform for the immunosensors based on
the amide linkage between antibodies and sensing materials.34−36 In this aspect, UV–vis spectral analysis assists us to confirm
the tagging of anti-AH with our synthesized AHC. The normal amide
formation in EDC/NHS coupling generally occurs based on the reaction
between −COOH and −NH2 group.37,38 In our case, the amide formation occurred between the −COOH
group of anti-AH and −NH2 group of our AHC probe
in MES buffer at optimized condition.39 First, absorption maxima of AHC were recorded in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) working buffer, and it showed two major absorption maxima
at 218 and 277 nm because of the existence of π–π*
and n−π* transitions, respectively (Figure 1a). We optimized the equivalents
of AHC with respect to the number of −COOH group present in
the anti-AH by UV–vis spectral analysis at lower and higher
concentrations of AHC. Two equivalents (2 mL, 0.001 M) and four equivalents
(4 mL, 0.001 M) of AHC were treated with one equivalent of anti-AH
(containing four −COOH group).40 The corresponding absorbance changes were recorded, and it was clearly
shown that 4 equiv of AHC at lower concentrations (0.001 M) containing
four −NH2 groups may be allowed to form amide link
with four −COOH groups of anti-AH, thereby leading to maximum
absorbance (Figure 1b). Whereas at higher concentration of AHC (0.01 M), the absorbance
intensity was lower which may be because of the poor solubility of
AHC. Hence, the precipitate was obtained. Initially, AH has showed
a maximum absorbance because of twisted international critical table
(ICT) state of the AH structure. After the formation of amide linkage,
the peaks at 218 and 277 nm were blue-shifted to 212 and 269 nm, respectively,
which may be because of the inhibition of initial twisted intramolecular
charge transfer as a result of complex formation between anti-AH (acceptor)
and AHC (donor) via amide linkage (Figure 1c), and hence decrement in absorbance was
absorbed. We have also cross-checked if any unbound AHC was present
in the resulting anti-AH–AHC. Briefly, the settled anti-AH–AHC
was washed with phosphate-buffered solution for 5 min and then centrifuged.
The resulting supernatant solution was analyzed by UV–vis spectra.
No peak corresponding to free AHC appeared for supernatant solution
in the UV spectra. This seems to be that all of the 4 equiv of AHC
were utilized for the amide linkage. Therefore, the UV–vis
spectral shift has clearly evinced and supported the completion of
anti-AH tagging with our AHC probe. The corresponding UV data are
shown in Figure 1d.

amidation through washing (d) [concentration of AHC is 0.001 M; bulk

is 0.002 μg/2000 μL in PBS buffer pH = 7.4, incubation
temperature is 4 °C for one night].

Confirmation of Tagging of AHC with Anti-AH by Emission Analysis
The tagging was further studied with the help of fluorescent emission
analysis. Precisely, the initial emission maximum of AHC was analyzed
at the absorption maxima of 277 nm in PBS buffer, and the corresponding
emission was occurred at 390 and 505 nm. As a result of amide coupling,
the emission maxima at 505 nm was blue-shifted to 485 nm along with
a drastic decrement in the emission intensity as in the case of UV–vis
absorption spectra which may once again confirm the existence of inhibited
twisted ICT mechanism during the coupling of AHC with anti-AH. In
general, antibody-fluorescent tagging protocol may lead to a blue
shift and decrement in fluorescent intensity because of amide coupling.41,42 First, the AHC has shown maximum fluorescence because of the twisted
ICT state mechanism.43 After the coupling
of anti-AH via amide bond, the initial twisted ICT was inhibited,
and the repulsive interaction between the donor–NH2 and −COOH of anti-AH may rise the energy level of anti-AH/AHC
and hence shift to the lower wavelength was observed (blue shift)
The Stoke’s shift of the AHC was found to be 228 nm which shows
very excellent luminescent properties of AHC.44 After the anti-AH was tagged with AHC, the Stoke’s shift
was calculated as 216 nm. Generally, proteins, bacterial-based tagging,
will give a large Stoke’s shift greater than 200 nm-based.45−47 Likewise, our anti-AH tagged with AHC has shown excellent Stoke’s
shift, and the respective emission spectra are shown in Figure 2.

for one night].

Development of Fluorescent
Immunoassay for A.
hydrophila Using Anti-AH–AHC
Generally,
we have to be more aware on Aeromonas colonization as human pathogens because of its association with
gastrointestinal diseases. Our developed simple fluorescent immunoassay
will be a better analytical tool to quantify the colonies of A. hydrophila. Although varying the concentration
of AH from 10–1 to 10–12 CFU/g,
the emission intensity of peaks at 390 and 485 nm was increased with
increasing AH concentrations without any peak shift; however, at higher
concentration of AH, the above peaks were merged into a single new
peak at 411 nm with increment in intensity. The Stoke’s shift
of 208 nm from its excitation wavelength was observed during this
interaction. The respective emission data along with the linear regression
plot are shown in Figure 3. The sensitivity of the developed immunoassay was analyzed
using colony counting method based on the dilution of stock culture
of A. hydrophila, and the corresponding
linear range of detection was found from 4 to 736 CFU/mL with the
LOD of 2 CFU/mL.

Selectivity Study of Anti-AH–AHC Immunoassay toward A. hydrophila
The important aspect of any
immunoassay is its selectivity toward the targeted pathogen among
all possible interfering pathogens. The antibody-tagging technology
opens a new pathway for the most selectivity toward particular pathogens.40,47 The fluorescent labeling has been keynoted as a very good immunoplatform
without using any blocking agents as in the case of electrochemical
immunoassay.48 In our present immunoassay,
we have tagged the AHC with anti-AH, and hence there is no doubt that
the resulting anti-AH–AHC will be attached with its pathogen
more specifically. To check the selectivity of the above immunoassay, the pathogens that
have an analog behavior to AH, such as Escherichia
coli, Bacillus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus
aerus were analyzed. There was a slight decrease in
the emission intensity of the peaks at 390 and 485 nm and was noted
for all other pathogens instead of increase in intensity as in the
case of AH. Therefore, the results firmly support the selectivity
of anti-AH–AHC toward A. hydrophilaand shown in Figure 4.

in the presence of other pathogens (a) and the corresponding bar diagram
(b) [concentration of AHC is 0.001 M; bulk concentration of anti-AH
is 100 μg/100 μL and anti-AH–AHC is 0.002 μg/2000
μL; AH and other pathogens is 10–1 CFU/g in
PBS buffer pH = 7.4; incubation time is 5 min].

Competitive Performance of the Immunoassay in the Presence of
Other Interfering Pathogens
The selective immunosensing of
anti-AH–AHC was proved via a selective recognition study and
firmly confirmed the immunocomplex formation only between AH and anti-AH–AHC
(Figure 2). The selective
nature was again confirmed by performing the competitive analysis
using other possible interfering pathogens such as E. coli, Bacillus, P. aeruginosa, and S.aerus (Figure 5). Interaction
of all of these pathogens slightly quenches the initial fluorescent
intensity of anti-AH–AHC which may be because of nonfluorescent
complex formation via FRET quenching.45 The competitive test was performed by incubating 1 equiv of 2 mL
of anti-AH–AHC with 1 equiv (10 μL, 10–1 CFU/g) of AH and 1 equiv (10 μL, 10–1 CFU/g)
of all interfering pathogens, and the corresponding fluorescent intensity
changes were recorded. Remarkably, there was no quenching in the fluorescent
intensity for anti-AH–AHC. Hence, the designed immunoassay
has proved to be very selective only for the AH in the presence of
other interfering pathogens.

PBS buffer pH = 7.4; incubation time is 5 min].

Observation of Fluorescent and Naked Eye Color Changes Using
UV–Vis Trans Illuminator
Generally, fluorescent sensors
show excellent color changes toward various analytes such as biomolecules,49 metal ions,50 and
pathogens, specifically.51 In our case,
we have used AHC as a fluorescent tag because of its excellent quantum
yield of 0.90 which is comparable with the standard rhodamine 6G dye.
First, the AHC has exhibited orange fluorescent color under UV–vis
lamp in MES buffer medium (pH 5.4). After the amide coupling with
anti-AH, the initial color was diminished and changed slightly into
yellowish green. Finally, after the formation of an immunocomplex
between the AH and anti-AH–AHC, a bright-green fluorescent
color change was observed, and images are given in Figure 6a. Under naked eye condition,
initially, the AHC was deep orange in color; after coupling with anti-AH,
it became slightly yellow in color, and then, finally, it turned into
deep-bright-green fluorescent after binding with AH (Figure 6b). These results supported
the utility of AHC as a fluorescent tag for the detection of AH.

changes observed during the development of immunoassay: (a)
fluorescent color changes (a) and naked eye visualization (b) [(1)
AHC, (2) anti-AH–AHC, and (3) AH/anti-AH–AHC].

The accumulation of AH in the
organs of fish grown in contaminated
water (where they were grown for different days) was analyzed through
imaging the color change of anti-AH–AHC during binding with
AH using a transilluminator. The fluorescent color of anti-AH–AHC
increases with the increasing growing time and is shown in Figure 7. All of these observations
also supported the accumulation of AH in the fish organs and selectivity
of immunoassay toward AH pathogen.

Figure 7 Fluorescent color changes observed in
fish organs at different
day intervals (a) and at the extract of the corresponding dissected
samples in buffer solution (b).

Sensing Mechanism of the AH/Anti-AH–AHC Fluorescence
Immunoassay
Among all fluorescent-sensing mechanisms, intra/intermolecular
charge-transfer-based mechanism has been commonly existing in various
fluorescent sensing assays.52−54 After tagging, the formation
of amide linkage between anti-AH and AHC may be responsible for the
spectral shift in both UV–vis as well as fluorescence emission
spectra with decrement in absorbance/emission intensity. On the basis
of the blue shift, it is confirmed that the synthesized AHC has shown
maximum absorbance/emission which may be because of the twisted ICT
mechanism among the molecule itself from donor −NH2 to acceptor anthracene moiety.55 After
tagging with anti-AH, the initial twisted intramolecular charge-transfer
mechanism among AH molecule was inhibited because of the amide coupling
between donor −NH2 of AHC and −COOH of anti-AH.
Therefore, the donating nature of −NH2 to anthracene
moiety was arrested. As a result, a blue shift was observed which
may be because of the electronic charge repulsion between the two
strong electron charge entities of the −NH2 group
in AHC and −COOH group in anti-AH via amide bond formation,
and this repulsion finally might increase the energy levels of the
anti-AH–AHC, which results in the blue shift. Interestingly,
when the pathogen AH was incubated with the anti-AH–AHC, the
fluorescent intensity was increased enormously. This phenomenon may
be because of aggregated induced emission (AIE) of the resulting immunocomplex
formation. After the incubation with pathogen, all of the AHC molecules
in anti-AH–AHC might come closer to each other, and thereby
the antharacene moiety in AHC can undergo dimerization or aggregation.
In general, fluorescent intensity of anthracene-containing molecules
will be enhanced in solution/solid phase because of the aggregation-induced
phenomenon.56−58 Therefore, the fluorescent intensity of the immunoassay
was increased.51,59,60 Therefore, based on these UV–vis and emission spectral changes,
it is confirmed that two interesting mechanisms such as inhibition
of twisted ICT and AIE are existing during the formation of anti-AH–AHC
and AH/anti-AH–AHC immunocomplexes, respectively, under optimized
conditions (Scheme 1).

Formation
of Anti-AH–AHC and AH/Anti-AH–AHC Complex in the Immunoassay
Determination of Quantum
Yield (ϕ)
Using the
emission data, the fluorescence quantum yield (ϕ) at various
steps were estimated by integrating the area under fluorescence curves
using the following equation.46 The absorbance
value of AHC, anti-AH, and AH/anti-AH–AHC was chosen from Figure 1. The integrated
area under the emission spectra of AHC and its complexes were calculated
at the excitation wavelengths of 505 nm (AHC), 485 nm (anti-AH–AHC),
and 411 nm (AH/anti-AH–AHC), respectively, in a phosphate buffer
(pH = 7.4) and compared with quantum yields of rhodamine 6G in ethanol.61  where, ϕ is the quantum yield; I is the integrated
area under the corrected emission spectra; A is the
absorbance at the excitation wavelength; λex is the
excitation wavelength; η is the refractive
index of the solution; and the subscripts u and s refer to the unknown
and the standard, respectively. The quantum yield of rhodamine 6G
dye was calculated as 0.94 in absolute ethanol medium at an excitation
wavelength of 470 nm.62 The quantum yield
of AHC, anti-AH–AHC, and AH/anti-AH–AHC was calculated
as 0.80, 0.328, and 0.90, respectively, and calculations were given
at the end of the section. The aggregation may lead to an increment
in quantum yield after binding with AH.56−58,63,64

Analysis of Accumulation
of A. hydrophila in Organs of O. mossambicusFingerlings
The fingerlings
of O. mossambicuswere grown in A. hydrophila contaminated
water for 7 days and the images of growing vessels are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The detailed
protocol was given in the above Materials and Methods section. The accumulation of AH in three different organs such as
guts, liver, and tissue of O. mossambicusfingerlings and the remaining portion of AH in growing medium were
analyzed. In addition, the photo images of the organs dissected from O. mossambicus fingerlings for 7 days are shown in
the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

After dissection, the organs of the fish were collected for each
day, and samples were prepared as per the procedure given in Materials and Methods section and analyzed for the
AH accumulation using the emission method (Figure 8a–c). Among these organs, higher accumulation
of AH was found at guts than at liver and tissue. The results obtained
were compared and also confirmed using the colony counting method.
The colony formation of AH on a disc was also analyzed at the biologically
simulated conditions of fish guts (Figure S3). The calculated CFU values are given in Table 1 and compared with the plate count method.

For cross-checking, the amount of
AH in contaminated water was
also tested using emission method for each day. The concentration
of AH was found higher in the medium on the first day, and it started
to decrease as the day goes up to fifth day, whereas in fish organs,
a reverse trend was observed. However, after the fifth day, the amount
of AH found in fish organs and the medium attained saturation (Figure 8d). Meanwhile, we
have also performed the control experiments (Figure 8e). The results obtained from emission and
colony-forming techniques have shown very good agreement. No doubt,
the real potent application and the other main theme of our work are
successfully demonstrated in fish samples.

Conclusions
Hence,
a very first fluorescent-based immunoassay is developed
for the specific and ultrasensitive detection of A.
hydrophila. We have designed a natural 4H-chromene core-based, AHC, as a fluorescent tag via the one-pot greener
approach using ultrasonication method. Then, it was tagged with the
anti-AH successfully and applied for the qualitative and quantitative
detection of A. hydrophila from 4 to
736 CFU/mL with the LOD of 2 CFU/mL. To further enhance the application
of our developed immunoassay, it was applied for the real-time quantification
of A. hydrophila accumulation in organs
of O. mossambicusfingerlings. Results
have shown excellent agreement with the plate-counting method, and
we assure that it would be a better immunoanalytical tool for the
quantification of A. hydrophilain fish
and some food samples.

Materials and Methods
We have used
analytical grade solvents and double distilled water
throughout the studies. Malononitrile, resorcinol, anthracene-1-carboxaldehyde,
HCl, disodium mono hydrogen phosphate, monosodium dihydrogen phosphate,
glacial acetic acid, ammonium acetate, sodium acetate, absolute ethanol,
high-performance liquid chromatography methanol, ammonium chloride,
liquid ammonia, piperidine, NaOH, and KCl were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemical Company. The acetate salts of metal ions analyzed were purchased
from Merck and Avra Chemicals. Anti A. hydrophila IgG fraction monocolonal antibody [Clone 6B10/A5] was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, California, via dealers from Synergy
Scientific Services Pvt. Ltd., India. Bacterial strains such as A. hydrophila (MTCC1739), Salmonella
paratyphi A (MTCC 735), Bacillus (MTCC 430), S. aureus (MTCC96), E. coli (MTCC 448), and P. aeruginosa (MTCC 2534) were originally obtained from Microbial Type Culture
Collection Centre, Institute of Microbial Technology, Chandigarh,
India. Pure culture of all bacterial strains was procured from MTCC,
Pune, and maintained in Luria Bertani medium at 37 °C for 16
h.

NMR studies were carried out using Bruker-400 MHz spectrometer
for 1H and 13C NMR analysis using CDCl3 and DMSO-[d6] as solvents containing
a trace quantity of tetramethylsilane as the internal standard, and
the chemical shifts are reported in parts per million at 25 °C.
UV spectra were recorded using Shimadzu single-beam UV–vis
spectrophotometer. Finally, fluorescent measurements were done with
the help of Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer having a 450 W xenon lamp.
Bandwidths of 5 and 2.5 nm were maintained as excitation and emission
slit widths, respectively, throughout the experiments.

Ethical Statement
Fish were maintained in accordance
with the guidelines of the American fisheries society (Guidelines
for the use of fish, 2014) and approved by the institutional ethical
committee of Madurai Kamaraj University [Internal Research and Review
Board (IRB), Ethical Clearance (EC), Biosafety and Animal Welfare
Committee].

One-Pot Greener Synthesis of AHC
4H-chromene derivative was synthesized via one-pot
greener approach
using ultrasonication method. In brief, antharacene-1-carboxaldehyde
(1.0 mmol), malononitrile (1.0 mmol), and resorcinol (1.0 mmol) were
dissolved one by one in 5 mL of absolute ethanol and stirred for 2
min. Then, catalytic amount of piperidine (300 μL) was added
with constant stirring. Then, the resulting solution mixture was kept
in an ultrasonication bath (1.5 Hz) and was sonicated for 20 min (Scheme S1). In between the reaction times, the
crude reaction mixture was analyzed for the completion of the reaction
by using TLC (by observing a single spot). After the confirmation
of reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water,
and a light yellow precipitate was obtained. This solid was filtered
and washed thoroughly for three times with diethyl ether and absolute
ethanol, and finally, it was dried over anhyd. CaCl2. It
was further separated through organic separation method using diethyl
ether and water mixture as a solvent. The ether layer was separated,
evaporated, and then the obtained yellow color solid was recrystallized
using absolute hot ethanol to obtain a pure product. The yield was
calculated to be 98.5% (1.92 g). The structure of the synthesized
4H-chromene derivatives (1a–d) was thoroughly
characterized by NMR technique, and the corresponding coupling constant
values are given below.

Protocol for the Tagging of AHC with the AH Antibody
The
AHC was tagged with anti-AH via standard EDC/NHS coupling protocol.30−32 In briefly, 1 equiv of anti-AH (1 mL, 100 μg/μL) in
MES buffer and 4 equiv (4 mL, 0.001 M) of AHC were mixed, and then
100 μL of each solution of EDC and NHS were added one by one
to the above solution. It was gently stirred for 1–2 h and
then kept for incubation at 4 °C for 1 day. Then, the resultant
tagged anti-AH/AHC (0.002 μg) was allowed to stand at room temperature
for 5–10 min, and then it was completely centrifuged at 30 000
rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were collected
and washed thoroughly with PBS buffer for five times. The unbound
AHC was removed by simply washing with PBS buffer and confirmed by
analyzing the supernatant solution using UV–vis spectra until
the disappearance of standard UV–vis peak of AHC. The final
anti-AH/AHC in buffer solution was stored at 4 °C for further
studies (Scheme S2).

Bacterial Cultivation
Pure culture of AH bacteria was
procured from MTCC1739 strain, Pune, India. It was grown initially
in tryptic soya broth and maintained in Luria Bertani medium at 30
°C for 16 h for further studies. The bacterial cells were then
separated through centrifugation (6000 rpm, 20 min) and then rinsed
thrice with PBS. The culture was serially diluted with physiological
saline solution, and the viable cell number was determined via the
most probable number method.

Development of Immunosensor (AH/Anti-AH–AHC)
Under optimized conditions, 2 mL of AHC/anti-AH (0.002 μg)
was mixed thoroughly with 10 μL of AH pathogens diluted in different
CFU, and then they were incubated at 4 °C for 25 min. The major
absorption maxima at 277 nm were fixed as excitation wavelength, and
the corresponding fluorescence spectra were recorded at 411 nm, and
all of these experiments were carried out in the phosphate buffer
(PBS, pH = 7.4) medium throughout the studies.

Fish Maintenance and Treatment
Procedure
Fingerlings
of O. mossambicus were grown in artificial
condition (plastic turf in laboratory condition) for 1 month, subsequently;
they were transferred in to 250 mL conical flask in the presence of
sterile water (200 mL) and kept for acclimatization for 15 days inside
the sterile laminar hood. After acclimatization, AH was inoculated
in seven different conical flasks along with fingerlings of O. mossambicus, and 100 μg/mL concentration
of filter-sterilized glucose was added to enhance the growth of AH.
From first day to seventh day, fingerlings were sacrificed using sterile
dissection apparatus in sterile condition, and liver, guts, and tissues
samples were collected in sterile PBS (pH = 7.4), and a loop-full
suspension was inoculated in the AH growth-specific media to check
the increasing number of bacterial colony. O. mossambicus in sterile water without AH was used as a control, and the experiment
was performed thrice in a triplicate manner.
