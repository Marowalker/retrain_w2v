Herein, we report
the design, synthesis, and cyanide-scavenging
behavior of circularly arranged sextuple molecule 4. The six syringaldehyde
units carrying equal number of dimethoxyphenolic moieties projecting
at the periphery make the molecule highly efficient for cleaning up
cyanide from the aqueous solution. The stoichiometric data 1:6 showed
that six units of cyanide interact with one unit of compound 4. The
association constant of the compound for cyanide was 2.5 × 104 M–1, and its detection limit for cyanide
was 10 nM. The compound was also found to remove cyanide bound to
cytochrome c oxidase.

1 Introduction
The affinity of CN– for Fe2+ of cytochrome c (Cyt c) makes it one of the highly toxic
anions1−6 because Cyt c–CcOX (cytochrome c oxidase) complex is the last enzyme in the respiratory electron
transport chain and the blockage of this pathway limits the oxygen
supply that ultimately proves lethal.7,8 In addition
to the available reports on cyanide sensing9−18 and sequestering compounds such as hydroxocobalamin,19−24 dicyanocobalt(III) porphyrins,25−28 vitamin B12 analogues,29,30 and hexahydrated dichlorides of cobalt(II),31−34 it was found recently that compounds 1–3 (Chart 1) were capable of removing cyanide from the aqueous medium
and human blood serum35,36 through the more prevalent keto-form
of their phenolic moiety and disposing it off in the form of COOH.
Hence, it was logically hypothesized that the presence of more such
phenolic groups in the molecule may increase its cyanide-sensing capacity
and that the capturing of cyanide per molecule of the receptor becomes
more effective. Therefore, it was planned to introduce six 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)indolin-2-one
units on the benzene core, and consequently, compound 4 (Chart 2) was designed.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
Compound 5 was obtained by the methylation of syringaldehyde, and it
was made
to react with oxindole by heating at 145 °C to obtain compound 6 (Scheme 1). Compound 6 was procured as inseparable E- and Z-isomers
in the ratio 4:1. For the synthesis of compound 8, first
mesitylene was treated with formaldehyde and HBr–AcOH to get
compound 7 and then compound 7 was refluxed
with Br2 in 1,2-dibromoethane wherein compound 8 was obtained. Further reaction of compounds 6 and 8 in acetonitrile (ACN) in the presence of K2CO3 resulted into the replacement of all the six Br of compound 8 with compound 6, and consequently, compound 9 was procured. Selective demethylation of compound 9 was achieved by using AlCl3 in dichloromethane
(DCM) providing desired compound 4 (Scheme 1). The energy-minimized geometry
of compound 4 indicates circular shape of the molecule
with the six 3-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzylidene)indolin-2-one units
projecting alternatively upward and downward of the benzene plane.
All the six phenolic units are directed outward from the central hydrophobic
core (Chart 2).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Compound 4
2.2 Cyanide-Scavenging Studies
Addition
of compound 4 [1 μM, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–H2O (1:9) v/v] to the aqueous solutions of different anions
changed the color of the solution containing cyanide (Figure 1). The UV–vis spectrum
of compound 4 [1 μM, DMSO–H2O
(1:9), pH 7.0] showed an absorption maximum at 373 nm. Incremental
addition (1 μL at each step) of cyanide (1 μM in H2O) to the solution of compound 4 resulted in
the decrease in intensity of the absorption band at 373 nm with concomitant
emergence of a new band at 535 nm (Figure 2). The spectral changes were observed until
the addition of 16 equiv of cyanide (very small changes after the
addition of 10 equiv CN–). The band at 373 nm was
diminished, and the other one at 535 nm was highly intense. At this
stage, the compound–cyanide solution was dark orange in color.
Apparently, the compound interacted with CN– and
consequently resulted in the change of the UV–vis spectrum
as well as the color of the solution of compound 4. The
selective and competitive binding of the compound with cyanide was
ascertained with the help of appropriate experiments, and the results
are depicted in Figure 3. The stoichiometry of compound–cyanide, found through Job’s
plot of continuous variation, was 1:6 (Figure 4), and the association constant (Ka) was 2.5 × 104 M–1 (Supporting Information). The detection
limit of compound 4 for cyanide was 10 nM (Supporting Information). It was observed that
in comparison to compounds 1–3, compound 4 was more effective in the detection of cyanide even at lower
concentration than that of compounds 1–3 (Table S1).

Figure 1 Color change of compound 4 (1 μM, DMSO–water,
1:9 v/v) in the presence of anions (10 equiv): CN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, AcO–, SCN–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, HCO3–, and CO32–.

Assisted removal of compound 4 of cyanide from
an
aqueous solution was demonstrated with a physical experiment. Addition
of 10 μL of 1 μM cyanide to 1 mL of 10 nM solution of
compound 4 in acetone–water (1:9) turned the color
of the solution to orange, indicating that 10 nM CN– is detected by the compound (Figure 5A). The aqueous part of this solution left after repeated
(4–5 times) extraction with ethyl acetate did not respond to
the addition of compound 4 (Figure 5A), indicating that all the cyanide was bound
to the compound and extracted with ethyl acetate. The observations
were confirmed by performing a control experiment (Figure 5B) in which the aqueous solution
of cyanide was extracted 4–5 times with ethyl acetate, but
still the aqueous part responded to compound 4, indicating
that cyanide was not removed with ethyl acetate. Similar experiments
with compounds 1 and 3 required, respectively,
10 μM and 200 nM compound for the removal of 10 μM and
10 nM cyanide from the respective aqueous solution (Table S1).

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the experiment showing extraction
of
cyanide from the aqueous solution with the help of compound 4.

Therefore, in consistent with
the design of the molecule, compound 4 was capable of
selective and competitive detection of CN–. The
mass spectrum of the solution of compound 4 with cyanide
(solution obtained after the last addition
of cyanide in the UV–vis experiment) showed peaks at m/z 2081 and 2230 supporting the addition
of cyanide to the compound and subsequent hydrolysis of the CN group
to COOH (Figure 6, Supporting Information).

Figure 6 Mass spectrum of the
solution of compound 4 and cyanide
showing the reaction of cyanide with compound (m/z 2081 calcd m/z 2081
[M + H]+) and subsequent hydrolysis of CN to COOH (m/z 2230 calcd m/z 2230 [M + Na]+).

The compatibility of compound 4 with the CcOX
pathway
as well as the removal of Cyt c–CcOX bound
cyanide was screened through enzyme immunoassay. Complementing the
enzymatic activity of CcOX, Cyt c–Fe2+ was oxidized to Fe3+ in the presence of CcOX, and hence,
the absorbance intensity at 550 nm gets decreased (Figure 7A). Incremental addition of
cyanide to CcOX was made, and the resulting solution was added to
the solution of Cyt c. A stepwise increase in the
absorbance intensity at 550 nm (Figure 7B) was observed, which indicated the blockage of CcOX
with CN–. Further addition of compound 4 to the above solution of Cyt c–CcOX–CN– decreased the absorbance intensity at 550 nm (Figure 7C). Apparently, the
compound removed cyanide from CcOX, and the latter oxidized Cyt c–Fe2+ to Fe3+, resulting in
the decrease of intensity at 550 nm. The binding of cyanide to compound 4, in preference to CcOX, was checked by adding cyanide solution
to the solution of Cyt c–CcOX–compound 4: the absorbance intensity at 550 nm remains minimum up to
the addition of 160 μM cyanide. However, addition of more cyanide
to the above solution led to the increase in the absorbance intensity
at 550 nm (Figure 7D). All these observations indicated that (i) 160 μM cyanide
was accommodated by compound 4 and (ii) the cyanide preferred
compound 4 over CcOX for interaction. Therefore, the
compound under present investigation may act as an effective antidote
of cyanide poisoning.

Figure 7 Working of the compound with cytochrome c oxidase:
(A) UV–visible absorbance of 5.5 μM cyt c in assay buffer was monitored at a wavelength of 550 nm on incremental
(10 μL) addition of CcOX (diluted in enzyme buffer). Decrease
in absorbance was due to the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ of Cyt c by CcOX. (B) Change in absorbance
at 550 nm of Cyt c on addition of CcOX solution along
with 0–3 μM CN–, showing decrease in
the enzymatic activity of CcOX in the presence of cyanide. (C) Absorbance
intensity of solution obtained at step “B” was decreased
on addition of 2 μM compound 4, indicating removal
of cyanide from CcOX by the compound. (D) (a) No absorbance at 550
nm in the presence of compound 4 (10 μM) and 160
μM CN– and (b) addition of more CN– increased the absorbance intensity at 550 nm.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, the rational
modification of compounds 1–3 to compound 4 has significantly improved its cyanide-scavenging
capacity. Supporting the design of the molecule, in comparison to
compounds 2 and 3, the present compound
was capable of removing cyanide from the aqueous solution and CcOX
at much lower concentration than that of compounds 2 and 3. Detailed studies with the compound using animal models
will be reported in the near future.

4 Experimental
Section
1H and 13C NMR spectra were
recorded on JEOL
400 MHz and Bruker 500 MHz NMR spectrometers, respectively, using
CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical shifts are given in parts
per million with tetramethylsilane as the internal reference. Both 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compounds 9 and 4 were recorded by keeping the relaxation time
5–7 s. It seems that the CH2 and central benzene
signals are buried inside the molecule and hence difficult to pick
up though the integration in 1H NMR spectrum and number
of carbons are correct. Mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF-Q
II mass spectrometer. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on glass plates coated with silica gel GF-254. Column chromatography
was performed with 60–120 mesh silica. Infrared (IR) and UV–vis
spectral data were recorded on FTIR Agilent CARY 630 and BIOTEK Synergy
H1 Hybrid Reader instruments, respectively.

4.7 UV–Vis
Titration of Compound 4 with CN–
Stock solution of compound 4 (1 × 10–3 M) was diluted to 1 μM
concentration by using DMSO–H2O, 1:9 v/v. Stock
solution of NaCN (1 × 10–3 M, water) was prepared.
The absorbance of the compound solution was noted, which shows absorption
maxima at 373 nm. Incremental addition (1 μL) of cyanide solution
to the compound solution was made. The absorption intensity at 373
nm gets decreased, and the intensity of new band at 535 nm goes up.

4.8 Selectivity of Compound 4 for
CN–
Stock solutions of CN–, Br–, F–, AcO–, H2PO4–, HCO3–, SCN–, CO32–, Cl–, and I– (10–3 M in water) were prepared. Each anion (170 μL, 17 equiv) was
added to the compound solution one by one, and UV–vis spectrum
was recorded. Decrease in the absorption band at 373 nm and emergence
of a new band were observed only in the case of cyanide solution.

4.9 Experiments Showing Removal of CN– from Water by Compound 4
Removal of CN– from its aqueous solution with the help of compound 4 was ensured. Cyanide (10 μL, 1 μM) and compound
(10 μL, 1 μM) were taken in acetone–water (1:9,
1 mL). This orange colored solution was extracted with ethyl acetate
(4 × 25 mL). Addition of compound 4 (10 μL,
1 μM) to the aqueous part (obtained after extraction with ethyl
acetate) did not change the color of the solution, indicating absence
of cyanide in the aqueous part. As a control experiment, cyanide (10
μL, 10 μM) was taken in acetone–water (1:9, 1 mL),
and the solution was extracted was ethyl acetate (4 × 25 mL).
Treatment of the aqueous part (left after extraction with ethyl acetate)
with compound 4 (10 μL, 10 μM) turned the
color of the solution orange, indicating the presence of cyanide in
the aqueous part.

4.10 Working of Compound with
Cytochrome c Oxidase
The preparation of
assay buffer, enzyme
buffer, and other reagents was as per the protocol available with
the assay kit. The absorbance of cyt c (5.5 μM)
at 550 nm was noted. To the solution of cyt c (5.5
μM having 25 μL cyt c and 975 μL
assay buffer), 0.5 μL dithiothreitol (0.1 M) was added and kept
for 15 min. Incremental addition (10–50 μL) of CcOX (5
μL CcOX diluted with 45 μL enzyme dilution buffer) was
made, which led to a decrease in the absorbance intensity at 550 nm.
Addition of cyanide (1–3 μM) to the solution of CcOX
was followed by the transfer of each of this solution (CcOX–1
μM CN–, CcOX–2 μM CN–, CcOX–3 μM CN–) to the vial containing
cyt c, and absorbance at 550 nm was noted. Last,
compound 4 (10 μM) was added to the solution containing CcOX–3
μM CN– and cyt c.

Alternatively,
500 μL of solution containing cyt c (5.5 μM,
25 μL) and CcOX (5 μL CcOX diluted with 45 μL enzyme
dilution buffer) in assay buffer was mixed with 500 μL acetone–water
(1:9 v/v) solution containing compound 4 (10 μL,
10 μM in acetone) and CN– (62.5 μL,
160 μM in water). UV–vis spectrum of the above solution
was recorded. More cyanide (up to 185 μM) was added to the above
solution, and UV–vis spectra were recorded.
