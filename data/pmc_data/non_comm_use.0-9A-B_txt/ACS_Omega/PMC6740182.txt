Stainless
steels can become contaminated with radionuclides at
nuclear sites. Their disposal as radioactive waste would be costly.
If the nature of steel contamination could be understood, effective
decontamination strategies could be designed and implemented during
nuclear site decommissioning in an effort to release the steels from
regulatory control. Here, batch uptake experiments have been used
to understand Sr and Cs (fission product radionuclides) uptake onto
AISI Type 304 stainless steel under conditions representative of spent
nuclear fuel storage (alkaline ponds) and PUREX nuclear fuel reprocessing
(HNO3). Solution (ICP-MS) and surface measurements (GD-OES
depth profiling, TOF-SIMS, and XPS) and kinetic modeling of Sr and
Cs removal from solution were used to characterize their uptake onto
the steel and define the chemical composition and structure of the
passive layer formed on the steel surfaces. Under passivating conditions
(when the steel was exposed to solutions representative of alkaline
ponds and 3 and 6 M HNO3), Sr and Cs were maintained at
the steel surface by sorption/selective incorporation into the Cr-rich
passive film. In 12 M HNO3, corrosion and severe intergranular
attack led to Sr diffusion into the passive layer and steel bulk.
In HNO3, Sr and Cs accumulation was also commensurate with
corrosion product (Fe and Cr) readsorption, and in the 12 M HNO3 system, XPS documented the presence of Sr and Cs chromates.

1 Introduction
The
development of a low carbon-based energy economy is a global
priority, and nuclear power is an efficient, low-carbon energy source.
However, the unavoidable generation of large amounts of solid radioactive
waste and its costly management provide significant concerns.1,2 A major source of waste arises from the accumulation of radioactive
species from aqueous solution onto the surfaces of nuclear plant materials.3 This “plate-out” process, if not
controlled or mitigated, creates challenges for final material disposal
as many of the materials are voluminous, can be hard to decontaminate,
and are difficult to compress. The advancement of reliable and cost-effective
decommissioning and decontamination strategies is consequently of
great importance to minimize waste volumes, which, in turn, provides
cost savings.

The widespread use of austenitic stainless steels,
such as AISI
Type 304L, as structural and storage materials4 at civil nuclear sites mean that these alloys become an important
source of radioactive waste over a site’s lifetime. Reliable
current estimates of the global amounts of nuclear industry radioactive
stainless steels are not available, but they are a significant waste
form (millions of tonnes).5 The selection
of stainless steel in the nuclear industry is based on a combination
of high radiation stability and excellent corrosion resistance, the
latter afforded by the spontaneous formation of a nanometer-scale
passivating Cr-oxide layer at the steel surface.6 It has been assumed that deposited radioactivity becomes
bound to/impregnated within this passive layer during the accumulation
process,7,8 although these phenomena have not been fully
demonstrated. However, to make informed decisions regarding the design
and optimization of effective decontamination treatments for these
materials, an understanding of the principal chemical interactions
driving radionuclide uptake onto or into the steel is critical.

The contamination phenomena witnessed during transport and storage
of radioactive materials and liquors are not completely understood.
It is known that, upon contact with aqueous solution, the passivating
surface oxide layer of stainless steel, like many natural sorbents,
is charged and interacts electrostatically with dissolved ions.9 On this basis, surface complexation models for
radionuclide groundwater transport (e.g., Carrol et al.10) have been applied to describe the sorption
properties of stainless steels.11,12 However, recent investigations
on the contamination of pressurized water reactor (PWR) materials
have shown sorption phenomena to be more complex, where complete characterization
is not possible by utilization of charge principles alone.13 Here, the elemental composition and morphology
of the passive layer were considered to provide chemical control of
the accumulation process, which may facilitate sorption from boric
acid coolant despite repulsive electrostatic interactions with the
surface. The importance of the passive layer condition for the character
of contamination strongly suggests that sorbent properties of stainless
steels are inherited from this surface oxide film. It is clear that
an assessment of the passivation state of the steel material is essential
in understanding radionuclide sorption. However, the elemental composition,
structure, and thickness of the surface oxide layer vary with the
composition and potential of the passivating medium, complicating
issues.14 Accordingly, the derived sorbent
properties are expected to reflect both steel composition and environment
chemistry, and therefore, “plate-out” phenomena must
be investigated on an individual basis under the specific conditions
of contamination.

Spent nuclear fuel storage and subsequent
reprocessing to recover
U and Pu are major activities at the back-end of a closed nuclear
fuel cycle. Spent fuels are also stored for long periods prior to
disposal in open fuel cycles. These activities have been implicated
in stainless steel contaminant plate-out processes.15 Initially, spent fuels are stored in fuel ponds to facilitate
the decay of short-lived fission products and to permit the dissipation
of heat. The water in spent fuel ponds becomes contaminated with radionuclides,
and in turn, the radionuclides can contaminate structural and storage
materials (including steels) used in the ponds. After sufficient cooling,
U and Pu recovery is then achieved in a closed cycle using solvent
extraction in HNO3 via the PUREX process (or derivates
of PUREX).16 The high acidity and strong
oxidizing power of the reprocessing liquors likely modify the passivation
state of steels used in the plant so that contamination processes
here cannot be reasonably expected to be comparable with those described
for PWR cooling circuit steel.13,17 However, this has not
been investigated, and many uncertainties surrounding the mechanisms
of fission product contamination for reprocessing plant materials
also remain. To address these issues (contamination of spent fuel
pond and reprocessing plant steels), it is necessary to characterize
the surface chemistry of the steel materials in contact with the pond
waters/HNO3 and identify the chemical processes that promote
radionuclide uptake and accumulation on steel materials.

In
this work, we seek to better understand 90Sr (t1/2 = 28.8 years) and 134+137Cs (t1/2 = ∼2 and 30.2 years, respectively)
uptake onto and distribution in AISI Type 304 stainless steel surfaces
across a range of solution chemistries representative of those found
in the U.K. spent fuel storage and reprocessing streams. Strontium
and cesium are high-yield fission products that are present in appreciable
amounts in fuel pond waters and reprocessing stream liquors.18,19 Further, they comprise a significant fraction of the total activity
deposited onto steels used for spent fuel storage and in reprocessing
plants.3 Model contamination systems were
used to simulate documented nuclear site conditions, and contamination
was subsequently characterized using solution uptake data and analysis
of the contaminated steel surface and near surface. A series of HNO3 matrices were used to model PUREX reprocessing streams, and
1 mM NaOH was used to simulate the conditions found in U.K. spent
fuel ponds, where steel pond furniture is used to store spent fuel
under alkaline conditions.19 The resulting
data provide critical information to aid in decision-making regarding
the cleaning and management of contaminated nuclear industry steels,
where the ultimate goal is to remove these materials from radioactive
waste sentencing and costly management.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Steel and Contamination Matrices
AISI Type 304 stainless steel was used in this study, and its composition
is detailed in Table S1. This type of stainless
steel is widely used in the nuclear industry (e.g., in reactors, reprocessing
plants, storage facilities, etc.)4 and
is considered to be the baseline stainless steel for research purposes.
The procedure for achieving contamination of the stainless steel used
in this study is fully described in our previous work.20 Briefly, solutions of 3, 6, and 12 M HNO3 and 1 mM NaOH (Aristar grade), which included 500 mg L–1 stable Sr and Cs, were used as the contaminant-bearing
matrices to simulate reprocessing waste streams and alkaline fuel
storage ponds at the Sellafield site. The stainless steel samples
were reacted in these solutions for 30 days with the temperature of
the solutions maintained at 60 °C.

2.2 Electron
Microscopy
Steel surface
morphology after immersion in the Sr- and Cs-bearing solutions was
characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI Quanta
200 SEM at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

2.3 Glow
Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy
Elemental depth analysis
of steel coupons was performed with glow
discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) using a GD-Profiler
2 (Horiba Jobin Yvon). The area being sputtered during GD-OES analysis
was 4 mm in diameter (see Section S2);
thus, the elemental depth profiles created by this technique represent
an averaged signal across an area of ∼0.13 cm2.
The applied power used during analysis was 35 W, and the Ar gas pressure
was 635 Pa. The elemental emission lines used for detection were 371.999
nm (Fe-I), 425.439 nm (Cr-I), 341.482 nm (Ni-I), 130.223 nm (O-II),
460.739 (Sr-II), 455.529 nm (Cs-I), and 396.157 nm (Al-I). The photon
detector was calibrated using a 1 mm Al sheet prior to analysis and
operated at a polychromator focal length of 500 mm and with 30 optical
windows. To maintain the vacuum seal at the O-ring–sample interface,
304 stainless steel coupons of dimensions of 20 mm × 20 mm ×
13 mm (l × w × t) were used for analysis.

2.4 Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
Strontium and cesium uptake
onto the steel surfaces was tracked
by removing 1 mL aliquots of solution from exposure experiments at
the following time intervals (0.17, 1, 6, 24, 168, 336, 504, and 672
h) followed by centrifugation (13,150g, 45 min).
Thereafter, 500 μL of the resulting supernatant was withdrawn
and diluted into 2% HNO3. Strontium, cesium, and alloying
elements (Fe, Cr, and Ni) were analyzed using an Agilent 7500cx ICP-MS.
Each uptake experiment was performed in triplicate, and the average
values are provided. The amount sorbed to the steel at time t, qt (g m–2), was calculated as follows  where c0 and ct are the
solution concentrations at time =
0 and t, respectively (g L–1), V is the volume of solution (L), and A is
the surface area of the exposed steel surface (m2).

2.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The composition of
the surface oxide layer and the chemical environments
of the contaminants were assessed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS). High-resolution scans were recorded using a Kratos AXIS Ultra
DLD XPS with a monochromatic Al X-ray source (1486.69 eV). The relative
fractions of Cr and Fe in the passive film were calculated as the
relative mass ratio (Croxide/(Croxide + Feoxide)) using the Cr 2p peaks at ∼575 and 584 eV and
the Fe 2p peaks located at ∼710 and 723 eV. Spectra were recorded
in duplicate, and the resulting surface Fe/Cr ratios were averaged.
Peak positions were charge-corrected by normalization with the C 1s
ubiquitous hydrocarbon peak at 284.6 eV.

2.6 Time-of-Flight
Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
The elemental distribution
of the contaminants and the alloying
elements on the steel surface were measured with an IONTOF TOF-SIMS5
of the reflectron type. Measurements were carried out using a pulsed
Bi/Mn liquid metal ion gun (30 keV) operated at a 0.8 μA emission
current. A 30 ns pulse width of the primary ion bunch at a 100 μs
cycle time enabled a mass resolution of secondary ions in excess of
8000 amu. High-resolution imaging was performed on scanning areas
of 50 μm × 50 μm. The most abundant isotopes were
selected for characterization.

2.7 Laser
Confocal Microscopy
GD-OES
crater depths were quantified with a Keyence VK-X200K 3D laser confocal
microscope at superfine resolution (2048 × 1536 pixels). Operating
at a 200× magnification and a 0.5 μm step size, the area
analyzed by the laser confocal microscope of the GD-OES crater was
∼6.0 mm × 6.5 mm.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Physical and Chemical Alteration
of Steel
Surfaces
To better understand the steel contamination mechanism,
it is necessary to first study the physical state and elemental composition
of the steel passive layer and its resulting corrosion state after
exposure to the solution matrices.

SEM analysis (see Section S1 and Figure S1) revealed no discernible
features of the surface morphology after immersion in the alkaline
and less concentrated acid contaminating matrices (3 and 6 M HNO3) at 60 °C for 30 days. The uniform and low corrosion
rate under moderately oxidizing solution conditions is associated
with the formation of a protective Cr2O3 surface
film that leaves the underlying steel material in a passive (unreactive/corrosion-resistant)
state. In contrast, in the 12 M HNO3 matrix, the solution
is sufficiently oxidizing to transform insoluble Cr(III) (present
as Cr2O3) into soluble Cr(VI) species. The subsequent
depletion of Cr in the passive layer deteriorates the film’s
protective capabilities and may result in material failure.24 The breakdown of the passive layer under strongly
oxidizing conditions is known as transpassive behavior and is characterized
by the initiation of corrosion phenomena at the sites most susceptible
to Cr depletion, for example, defects, interfaces, or grain boundaries.22,23 This was observed in the 12 M HNO3 matrix by the preferential
corrosion attack at the grain boundaries (Figure S1C). Type 304 stainless steel also typically contains a small
volume fraction of remaining δ-ferrite,21 and corrosion at these ferrite interface regions was also apparent.
Depth analysis of the contaminated steel was then undertaken using
GD-OES (Figure 1).
The data are expressed as a function of “sputtering time”
and estimated “sputtered depth” (see Section S2 for further details). Here, the O signal was initially
intense, and the overlapping of the O and Cr maximum signals after
a short sputtering time coincides with the steel passive layer. Further
sputtering results in the complete loss of the O signal, thus corresponding
to the bulk material. Of note, the O signal rapidly diminished after
treatment in 12 M HNO3 (Figure 1C and Figure S3), which suggests that a stable surface oxide layer cannot be maintained
under such strongly oxidizing conditions. The reduced signal of the
protective passive film is expected to greatly increase the steel’s
susceptibility to various forms of corrosive attack, a result confirmed
by SEM analysis (Figure S1C).

contamination in (A) 3 M (B) 6 M, and (C) 12 M HNO3 and (D) 1 mM NaOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for 30 days,
with Sr and Cs as added contaminants. The O and Sr signals are scaled
by factors of 10 and 100, respectively, for clarity. (A) and (D) have
been redrawn from data presented by Lang et al.20 The x axis is expressed as sputtering
time and estimated sputtered depth. For details on the conversion
of time to depth, please see Section S2. Note that the x axis of (C) is different to the
other panels. Data from (C) (12 M HNO3 sample) is also
presented in Figure S3, with a redrawn x axis to allow better comparison of the oxygen data across
all samples.

After reaction in the alkaline
solution, the passive layer became
substantially thicker than those grown under acidic conditions. This
is shown by the increased persistence of the O signal in Figure 1D, which is accompanied
by a significant Fe signal at this early sputtering stage. The growth
of thicker films in alkaline media is related to the bilayer model
that is generally accepted for the steel passive layer structure.
The passive layer has been shown to be composed of an outer layer
rich in various Fe oxides and an inner layer composed of Cr2O3.25,26 While this outermost oxide layer
is relatively stable in neutral and alkaline solution, dissolution
rapidly occurs in highly acidic solutions owing to Fe’s high
solubility at acidic pH.27 Accordingly,
in 12 M HNO3, the passive film will contract as the Fe
oxide component is selectively leached into the solution. This behavior
was confirmed by solution analysis (Figure 2A) that recorded a significant increase of
Fe within 6 h of commencing Sr and Cs uptake studies. Thereafter,
the solution Fe concentration decreased, which may be indicative of
readsorption and/or reprecipitation of Fe corrosion products onto
the steel surface. The dissolution of Cr into 12 M HNO3 may also be considered a characteristic of the transpassive behavior
as it is known that effectively no Cr is released under passivating
conditions.28 Chromium readsorption and/or
reprecipitation was also observed (Figure 2A) during experimentation in 12 M HNO3. In the 3 and 6 M HNO3 experiments, Cr was not
detectable, likely due to the formation of a stable Cr-rich passive
layer at the steel surface in these solutions (Figure 1).

in 3,
6, and 12 M HNO3 during the Sr and Cs uptake study onto
type 304 stainless steel at 60 °C and (B) variation in the surface
layer oxide content of type 304 stainless steel as a function of passivation
treatment as determined by XPS (see the Supporting Information for details). Error bars are standard deviations
expressed at 2σ.

Another important effect
of selective Fe dissolution in acidic
solution is the enrichment of Cr in the passive layer relative to
the air (polished)- and alkaline-passivated specimens, as shown by
XPS measurements (Figure 2B). On the other hand, the low solubility of Fe in alkaline
solution yields a surface composition that is similar to the air (polished)-passivated
material. According to the literature, the slight increase in surface
Fe concentration at alkaline pH is due to the higher Cr solubility
under basic conditions,26,29 although in this work,
the presence of Cr in solution could not be detected (note that Cr
could not be reliably detected below a concentration of several hundred
μg L–1 in the alkaline samples due to the
dilution required for analysis). An examination of the binding energy
positions of the Fe and Cr 2p photoelectron peaks to identify the
chemical forms of the passive layer components is provided in the Supporting Information.

3.2 Sr and
Cs Kinetic Studies
In all
solution matrices studied, Sr and Cs accumulation on the steel surface
was reasonably rapid (Figure 3) with significant uptake of both elements occurring within
24 h. Uptake then continued but at a lower rate before an apparent
steady state was reached at 30 days. Other radionuclide sorption studies
have reported fast deposition rates onto austenitic stainless steel
materials from acidic and alkaline pH solution matrices,13,15 suggesting that plate-out is an inherently fast process.

onto type 304 stainless steel during reaction in
3, 6, and 12 M HNO3 and 1 mM NaOH solution at 60 °C.
Error bars are standard deviations expressed at 2σ.

In an effort to describe the Cs and Sr behavior over time,
the
solution data were analyzed with the Ho pseudo-second-order,30 Lagergren pseudo-first-order,31 and Elovich32 kinetic models.
As these models have previously been used to describe the removal
of low-valence metal ions from aqueous solution by solid substrates,33−35 it was postulated that the adsorption of Sr and Cs onto stainless
steel may also be governed by similar kinetic descriptions. The pseudo-second-order
kinetic model is based on the adsorption capacity of the sorbent and
is expressed as follows30,36  and  where qe is the
equilibrium sorption capacity (g m–2), k2 is the pseudo-second-order rate constant (m2 g–1 h–1), and h is the initial sorption rate (g m–2 h–1) as t → 0.

When the
left-hand term is plotted against t,
a linear plot of gradient 1/qe and a y-intercept of 1/k2qe2 are obtained. The adsorption pseudo-second-order
kinetic plots from the Ho model are shown in Figure S5 for all for systems studied, where the values of qe and k2 can be
calculated from the slope and intercept of the fits, respectively.

As per Figure S5, for all solution compositions
investigated, consistently high correlations (R2 ≥ 0.99) were obtained for this pseudo-second-order
kinetic model. In comparison, poorer correlations were obtained when
the experimental data were analyzed with the other models (see Section S4 and Table S2). On the basis of these
findings, it may be concluded that Sr and Cs contamination largely
follows pseudo-second-order kinetics over the entire reaction period.
In addition, the theoretical qe values
(Table S3), obtained from the gradients
of the pseudo-second-order kinetic plots (Figure S5), were found in all instances to be in excellent agreement
with the experimental values, further supporting the model selection.
It should be noted that experimental equilibrium sorption capacities
were determined by taking an average of the qt values measured at the last three time intervals (336, 504, and
672 h). In all instances, low standard deviations (≤10 %) were
calculated, supporting our assumption that equilibrium uptake had
been reached within 336 h.

A comparison of the theoretical equilibrium
sorption values showed
a marked influence of contaminating solution composition on the extent
of Sr contamination (Table S3), where uptake
increased with HNO3 molarity and was greatest under alkaline
conditions. In contrast, the amount of Cs reacting with the steel
surface was found to be largely independent of solution composition
and was only marginally higher at alkaline pH (Table S3). The effect of solution pH on metal ion uptake onto
austenitic stainless steel surfaces has previously been rationalized
by electrostatic surface complexation models based on the acido-basic
properties of the surface hydroxyl groups of the passive layer.11,12 The pH point of zero charge for austenitic stainless steels is known
to be acidic, reportedly within the pH range of 3–4.37 Accordingly, in the alkaline matrix, the steel
surface will acquire an overall negative charge that will interact
favorably with accumulating metal ions. As might be expected from
the difference in charge density, the adsorption behavior of Cs+ is less sensitive to electrical forces, and hence, the increased
affinity for sorption at alkaline pH is more apparent for Sr2+. In the case of the HNO3 solutions, the steel surface
now exerts a positive potential that acts to inhibit cationic sorption.
The steel’s higher affinity for Sr uptake under increasingly
acidic conditions (3 to 12 M HNO3) cannot be accounted
for by charge principles and suggests that additional processes are
controlling sorption behavior at acidic pH. This result is consistent
with one of the principal assumptions of the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model, which states that the sorption mechanism includes a chemical
sorption process.30,36 The inconsistent sorption capacities
may suggest that Sr uptake is more sensitive to surface speciation
changes derived from variations in the exact steel passivation condition
or to other chemical effects, for example, coprecipitation of Sr with
the products of steel corrosion. Finally, there was a marked increase
in the rate of Cs uptake onto the steel surface in 12 M HNO3 (Table S3). This too may reflect changes
in the steel passivation state or other chemical effects. Such reaction
pathways for Sr and Cs were further tested using surface-sensitive
techniques (see below).

3.3 Contaminant Depth Distribution
In
addition to alloy depth profiling analysis, the depth distribution
of Sr and Cs within the steel matrix was also evaluated with GD-OES.
Under passivating conditions (alkaline and 3 and 6 M HNO3), Sr was contained at the steel near the surface (upper 10–20
nm; Figure 1). Alignment
of the Sr maximum signal with the corresponding O and Cr signals (Figure 1) demonstrated enrichment
of this contaminant within the Cr2O3 passive
layer, irrespective of the composition of the passive film (in the
alkaline system, the passive layer had an outer layer rich in Fe that
then transitioned to a Cr-rich layer). These results collectively
suggest that, under passivating conditions, the depth of Sr contamination
is not significantly impacted by the composition of the passive layer
or the contaminating solution.

The Cr2O3 component, which is traditionally considered the source of corrosion
resistance, was observed to also afford protection of the underlying
material from contamination phenomena. On this basis, it is not surprising
that Sr bulk material diffusion was prominent after contamination
in 12 M HNO3 (Figure 1C), where breakdown of the Cr2O3 passive layer was a characteristic feature for this specimen. It
was determined by measurement of the GD-OES crater depth (Figure S2) that the Sr penetrating depth in 12
M HNO3 was ∼150 nm (Figure 1C).

For Cs depth characterization,
no signal could be detected for
any of the acidic systems investigated. This is likely due to the
small amounts of Cs accumulating on the steel surface and the insensitivity
of optical techniques for Cs detection.38 In contrast, when the steel was reacted under alkaline conditions
in the presence of Cs, Cs uptake was higher, and this resulted in
Cs concentrations that permitted GD-OES analysis. As shown in Figure 4, this showed that
Cs enrichment was only observed to ∼15 nm, within the Cr-enriched
oxide layer of this sample, in a similar fashion to Sr (Figure 1). Collectively, these depth
profiling results demonstrate that a stable Cr2O3 film is an adequate barrier against the mobilization of contaminants
into the bulk material.

stainless steel contaminated
in 1 mM NaOH aqueous solution at 60 °C for 30 days, with Sr and
Cs added as contaminants. The O and Cs signals are scaled by factors
of 10 and 100, respectively, for clarity. The x axis
is expressed as sputtering time and estimated sputtered depth. For
details on the conversion of time to depth, please see Section S2.

3.4 Spatial Distribution
Time-of-flight
secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) data from type 304 stainless
steel after contamination in 12 M HNO3 (Figure 5) clearly show the presence
of numerous Fe and Cr hotspots of ∼2 μm in diameter on
the steel surface. These features were not found at the steel grain
boundaries and may be formed by readsorption/reprecipitation of once
dissolved Fe and Cr (Figure 2A) onto the steel surface. The remarkably similar morphology
and locations of Sr enrichment with Fe and Cr hotspots are noteworthy
and suggest that Sr contamination may occur due to coadsorption and/or
coprecipitation with Fe/Cr species. Similar findings have been reported
in a previous radionuclide/stainless steel sorption study.39 The possibility that coadsorption/coprecipitation
reactions control Sr uptake here is also consistent with the observed
time dependence of Fe and Sr sorption as both solution profiles exhibit
a significant decrease after 6 h to reach an equilibrium state within
30 days. Further, after the first day of reaction, Cr was also readsorbed
onto the steel commensurate with Sr (Figures 2A and 3A). On this
basis, the increasing Sr uptake under more acidic conditions may,
in part, be rationalized by the higher Fe and Cr solution concentrations
that are available to participate in a coadsorption/coprecipitation
process. This inference is further supported by Sr XPS measurements
(see Section 3.5 for
further details), although the XPS data implicate Cr in Sr uptake
and not Fe. Finally, due to the spatial limitations of the GD-OES
analysis (which sputters ∼0.13 cm2 of the sample),
the impact that the micrometer-sized hotspots could have on Sr depth
penetration into the steel (Figure 1C) cannot be assessed. Their role thus warrants further
investigation.

(B–H)
the corresponding TOF-SIMS maps. The type 304 stainless steel specimen
was contaminated in 12 M HNO3 for 30 days at 60 °C.
Arrows show the positions of the grain boundaries.

TOF-SIMS data from the 12 M HNO3 Cs system showed
that
Cs accumulation on the steel surface was more homogeneous, with no
obvious correlation evident with Fe and Cr (Figure 5) or accumulation at the grain boundaries.
As such, sorption may be the dominant control facilitating Cs reaction
with the steel surface at acidic pH; however, XPS analysis (see Section 3.5 for details)
of this sample indicated that Cs reaction with Cr could also be a
factor governing Cs uptake.

Under the passivating conditions
of the alkaline pH system, as
expected, the decreased Fe and Cr solubility resulted in a marked
reduction in the extent of alloying element readsorption to the steel
surface (Figure 6).
Nevertheless, correlation of Fe, Cr, and Sr hotspots was still apparent
(although not as pronounced as for the 12 M HNO3 sample
(Figure 5)). Cesium
was also correlated with hotpots of Fe and, to a lesser extent, Cr.
The exact role of readsorption of Fe and Cr species in facilitating
Sr and Cs adsorption/coprecipitation in the alkaline system is not
clear, but XPS analysis again implicated Cr as a factor governing
Sr uptake to the steel. Unfortunately, Cs XPS analysis was not possible
for this sample (see Section 3.5 for further details).

area and (B–H)
the corresponding TOF-SIMS maps. The type 304 stainless steel specimen
was contaminated in 1 mM NaOH for 30 days at 60 °C. Arrows show
the positions of the grain boundaries.

For the 12 M HNO3 and alkaline samples, it is also interesting
to note that there was no preferential accumulation of either Sr or
Cs along the grain boundaries (Figures 5 and 6). These findings (from
stainless steel reacted at 60 °C) contradict the proposed Cs
contamination mechanisms for stainless steel at the elevated temperatures
found in nuclear reactors (∼650 °C).40 Here, Cs preferentially accumulates at the steel grain
boundaries and then penetrates into the steel subsurface. The contrast
between the two studies suggests that temperature plays an important
role in steel contamination mechanisms at nuclear sites and, for our
study, further implicates the hotspots as possible vectors allowing
contaminant penetration into the steel subsurface. Depth analysis
collected at a micrometer spatial scale is required to confirm this.

Finally, the solution, GD-OES, and TOF-SIMS data indicate that
minimization of corrosion product solution concentrations by frequent
renewal of the reprocessing streams and storage pond solutions may
prove to be an effective method to limit the extent of Cs and Sr contamination
of stainless steel.

on the steel surface was characterized by the corresponding Sr 3d3/2 and Sr3d5/2 XPS photoelectron peaks located
at ∼135 and 133 eV, respectively. The surface concentrations
obtained from contamination in 3 and 6 M HNO3 were too
low to detect the Sr 3d lines. As a result, data are only presented
for the 12 M HNO3 and 1 mM NaOH solution matrices (Figure 7), where Sr uptake
was higher. For the 12 M HNO3 system, deconvolution of
the Sr 3d core electron bands into the 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 components at 135.4 and 133.6 eV reveals the most probable
bonding environment as SrCrO4.41,42 This assignment is based on the fact that other plausible chemical
forms, such as Sr(NO3)2 and SrO, have significantly
different 3d5/2 binding energy positions, reported at 134.0
and 132.6 eV, respectively.43 In combination
with the GD-OES depth profiling and TOF-SIMS observations, this local
bonding environment may be interpreted as the coadsorption and migration
of Sr2+ into the Cr oxide passive layer. A comparison of
the XPS spectrum obtained from the alkaline pH contamination reveals
an additional component at 135.0 and 133.2 eV, corresponding to strontium
carbonate.44 This result suggests that
the coadsorption/coprecipitation of Sr with components of the contaminating
solution occurs across a large pH range and may be an inherent feature
to the Sr contamination process.

Figure 7 High-resolution XPS spectra of the Sr
3d photoelectron lines for
type 304 stainless steel contaminated in (A) 12 M HNO3 and
(B) 1 mM NaOH at 60 °C for 30 days and (C) for the Cs 3d photoelectron
lines for after contamination in 12 M HNO3 at 60 °C
for 30 days.

With regard to Cs, after the reaction
at alkaline pH, the Cs 3d
photoelectron lines could not be detected from the steel due to spectral
interference with the Fe 2p photoelectron peaks associated with the
Fe-rich passive layer (see the Supporting Information for further information). Similarly, as previously described for
GD-OES characterization, XPS analysis of Cs contamination under acidic
conditions could not reliably be performed; as a result, data are
only presented for the 12 M HNO3 matrix. Figure 7 shows the high-resolution
XPS spectrum associated with the Cs 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectron peaks, which are observed at 723.9 and 737.8 eV, respectively.
An examination of the literature suggests that the most probable chemical
state is Cs2Cr2O7,45 which, analogous to the Sr assignment, may be interpreted
as Cs complexation to the steel passive layer. It is not clear if
coprecipitated species remain associated during Sr and Cs migration
into the passive film since XPS cannot provide detailed information
on the local arrangement of atoms around the central atom. Rather,
the XPS technique can only distinguish different chemical environments
by significant variation in the electron densities of the absorbing
atomic species. On that basis, it is expected that the highly electron-withdrawing
chromate and carbonate complexes observed in this study will dominate
the Sr and Cs photoelectron line positions.

4 Conclusions
The results show that the extent and character
of type 304 austenitic
stainless steel contamination with the high-yield fission products
Sr and Cs are intimately related to the corrosion state of the steel
surface. Under alkaline conditions and in 3 and 6 M HNO3, the stainless steel is passivated, and contamination with Cs and
Sr was identified as a surface-based phenomenon in which selective
deposition in the Cr2O3 passive layer occurs.
However, in 12 M HNO3 under transpassive conditions, the
dissolving passive layer was found to be an ineffective barrier against
Sr diffusion into the bulk material. Further, the partial dissolution
of the steel surface directly led to an enhanced removal of Sr from
the solution, with higher concentrations of Sr colocated with Fe and
Cr hotspots, suggesting coprecipitation of the contaminants with Fe
and Cr that had initially dissolved from the steel. Interestingly,
the coincidence of Cs enrichment with Fe and Cr hotspots was also
observed under basic conditions, but not for the HNO3 matrices.
This would indicate that coprecipitation is not the dominant mode
of Cs uptake at low pH and that alternative contamination pathways
become available under acidic conditions. Future work should focus
on whether other confounding factors present in spent fuel reprocessing
and storage facilities (e.g., the presence of the other contaminant
radionuclides, dissolved metals, and/or organics) would affect Cs
and Sr contamination of steels.

This work has clear implications
for the design and implementation
of reprocessing schemes and subsequent decommissioning and post-operational
clean-out (POCO) at nuclear licensed sites. If contaminant diffusion
into the bulk material can be effectively inhibited during reprocessing
or spent fuel storage, then removal of surface bound contaminants
(e.g., via chemical washing) will likely prove to be a reliable decontamination
technique. As such, these contaminated steels could be easily removed
from radioactive waste sentencing. In contrast, chemical decontamination
techniques may not be effective if the Sr/Cs penetrates into the steel
passive layer or material bulk and/or coprecipitates with steel matrix
elements. In these circumstances, more aggressive physical decontamination
approaches may be required (e.g., shot blasting or ultrahigh pressure
water jetting) to remove the upper layers of the material’s
surface.
