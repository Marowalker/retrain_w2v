Glycerol carbonate
(GLC) was synthesized from glycerol and dimethyl
carbonate (DMC) over sodium aluminate (NaAlO2) catalysts.
The catalysts were prepared using a spray-drying method and compared
with those prepared using the conventional hot-air drying method.
Polyvinylpyrrolidone and glycerol were used as a catalyst template
to increase the surface area and porosity of the catalysts. Additionally,
different operating conditions were investigated such as the catalyst
concentration, glycerol-to-DMC ratio, reaction temperature, reaction
time, and catalyst reusability. The NaAlO2 catalyst prepared
using the spray-drying method with 30 wt % glycerol as the template
yielded the maximum GLC (85%) with 100% GLC selectivity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Glycerol
or glycerin is largely produced from biodiesel that commonly
involves the hydrolysis, saponification, or transesterification of
plant or animal oils.1 It has been estimated
that for every 9 kg of biodiesel produced, 1 kg of glycerol is produced.2 Glycerol can not only be used in the pharmaceutical,
food, and cosmetic industries but also as a chemical feedstock in
the production of several value-added chemicals such as glycerol carbonate
(GLC), polyesters, propanol, and formic acid, which can be used in
many industrial fields such as fuels, chemicals, and plastics.1,2

GLC is an environmentally friendly, high value-added product
that
has low toxicity and is biodegradable.2,3 It has a variety
of applications, being used in surfactants, pharmaceuticals, and paints.
Moreover, it can be used as an electrolyte, a solvent in lithium-ion
batteries, a monomer for polyurethane production, or a chemical feedstock
for synthesizing polycarbonates, polyamides, polyesters, etc.3−6 GLC can be synthesized in different ways, including: (i) using glycerol
as an alcohol source to react with carbon dioxide (CO2),
carbon monoxide (CO), or phosgene as a carboxylation source;3,7−11 and (ii) using glycerol to react with ethylene carbonate. However,
these processes pose challenges in terms of the toxicity of the reactants,
formation of unfriendly byproducts, and/or difficulty in purification.8,9,12−14 Among the various
methods of producing GLC, the transesterification of glycerol using
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is one of the most promising, direct, and
industrially possible pathways to produce a large volume of GLC.7,15 DMC is nontoxic and eco-friendly, and this process produces only
methanol as a co-product.16−20 However, highly active catalysts at relatively low reaction temperatures
are required on an industrial scale.

It has been reported that
various homogeneous or heterogeneous
catalysts can be used for the transesterification of glycerol with
DMC to produce GLC. However, using homogeneous catalysts has several
disadvantages, such as poor activity, a long reaction time, and difficulty
in separation.3,16,21−26 Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts have been more broadly used for
this reaction. It should be noted that solid base catalysts, such
as CaO,27 KF modified hydroxyapatite,28 Sr/Al mixed oxides,17 Mg–Ce mixed oxides,29 K2CO3/MgO,30 Mg1+xCa1–xO2 mixed oxides,31 sodium aluminate (NaAlO2),32 and NaOH/γ-Al2O333 are crucial for the reaction.
NaAlO2 is one of the most promising catalysts because it
is economical, easy to synthesize, and gives a high GLC yield,32 but it has a low surface area (∼1–3
m2/g) and lacks porosity. Therefore, it is of great interest
to develop a NaAlO2 catalyst with a larger surface area
and with high porosity.

In this study, we synthesized NaAlO2 catalysts using
two different drying methods: the conventional hot-air drying method
and a spray-drying method. The spray-drying method is of interest
in this work because this technique has many advantages for catalyst
preparation. For example, it creates controllably small particles
and distributes them uniformly and reduces the time for drying the
catalyst.32,34 Glycerol or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was
used as a pore-generating agent (template) to increase the surface
area of the NaAlO2 catalyst and to create different pore
sizes on the NaAlO2 catalyst. All the prepared catalysts
were then carefully evaluated for GLC production via the transesterification
of glycerol with DMC. The surface morphology of each catalyst was
characterized and then correlated with catalyst activity. The most
promising catalyst was then used to intensively investigate the effects
of the operating conditions on the catalyst activity and was repeatedly
recycled to examine its reusability.

2 Experiment
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
The required
quantity of NaAlO2 was dissolved in deionized water at
a weight ratio of 1:20. Following this, PVP or glycerol was added
to the solution at 0 and 30 wt % based on the weight of NaAlO2. At room temperature, the mixture was stirred using a hot
plate magnetic stirrer at 1500 rpm until it was well mixed. After
that, the mixture was divided into two portions—one for the
conventional drying (hot-air) method (denoted as HA) and the other
for the spray-drying method. For the conventional drying method, the
mixture was stirred and heated at 100 °C until the slurry was
obtained, which was then heated in an air oven at 110 °C overnight.
Subsequently, it was calcined in an air furnace at 700 °C for
6 h at a heating rate of 1 °C/s. A white-solid material was obtained,
which was ground and used as the catalyst. For the spray-drying method
(denoted as S), a spray dryer (LabPlant, SD-05) was used. The spray
dryer was operated by setting the inlet temperature at 180 °C
with a feeding rate of 1.5 mL/min and an air flow rate of 10 m3/h at the outlet. A white fine powder was gathered in a collector.
The sample was then calcined using the same conditions as the conventional
drying method. Before use, each prepared catalyst was sieved using
a standard mesh number of 100 (149 μm).

2.2 Catalytic
Activity Studies
The transesterification
reaction of glycerol with DMC to produce GLC by using each prepared
catalyst was conducted as follows. In a 25 mL glass container, 5 mmol
of glycerol (C3H8O3, 99.5%, QReC)
was mixed with 15–35 mmol of DMC (C3H6O3, 99%, Alfa Aesar). Then, a catalyst (5–40% of
the weight of glycerol used) was added to the mixture. The desired
temperature (T) in the range of 30–75 °C
was set for a heater-stirrer. The mixture was stirred at 1500 rpm
and heated to the setting point temperature. A thermocouple was immersed
into the mixture and the reaction container was covered with a lid.
Immediately after attaining the setting point temperature, the reaction
time was started. The reaction time (t) for each
batch was 1–5 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.6 mL
of ethanol and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 min.
The reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the catalyst, and
the liquid phase was analyzed using a gas chromatographer (GC-14A,
SHIMADZU, Japan) with a flame ionization detector and a DB-5 capillary
column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). Catalyst reusability
was also investigated using the method described above, unless an
alternative detail is provided. The product selectivity, glycerol
conversion, and glycerol yield were calculated using eqs 1–3 1   2   3  

2.3 Catalyst Characterization
The surface
morphology of each catalyst was imaged using a field emission scanning
electron microscope fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer
[field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)/energy-dispersive
system, FE-SEM: JEOL JSM7600F]. The surface area and pore volume of
each catalyst were analyzed using an N2-physisorption analyzer
with a Quantachrome Autosorp-1C instrument and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda methods at −196
°C. The thermal decomposition behavior under a nitrogen atmosphere
of each catalyst sample was assessed up to 1000 °C using thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA, PerkinElmer). The crystalline information of each catalyst
was examined using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD; JEOL JDX-3530
and Philips X-Pert, with Cu Kα radiation at 45 kV and 40 mA).
The basicity of each catalyst’s surface was measured using
the CO2-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) technique.
Each catalyst (0.20 g) was pretreated under an Ar flow at 500 °C
for 1 h and cooled to 50 °C. Following this, 10% CO2 in He was passed over the catalyst for 90 min. After that, the excess
CO2 was flushed out by allowing Ar to flow at 50 °C
for 3 h. Then, the temperature was increased to 900 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min while Ar was passed over the catalyst. In every
step, the gas flow rates were 30 mL/min. The CO2 desorption
was continuously monitored using a TCD-equipped GC (Shimadzu GC-2014).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Activity
of Prepared Catalysts for Transesterification
of Glycerol
All the prepared catalysts were investigated
for the transesterification of glycerol to GLC. The results are plotted
in Figure 1 which shows
that the GLC yield of 0-S (10.4%) was slightly higher than that of
0-HA (9.4%). However, the overall activity of 0-S and 0-HA was significantly
lower than that of the catalysts prepared using PVP or G as the template,
which yielded GLC in the range 13.0–26.5%. Additionally, a
commercial NaAlO2 catalyst was investigated for the reaction,
achieving a GLC yield of 14.3%. It was interesting to notice that
the commercial catalyst had a GLC yield greater than that of the catalysts
with 0% template. Moreover, when comparing the catalysts prepared
using different preparation techniques with an identical template
and the wt % of the template, all GLC yields of the prepared catalysts
using the spray-drying method were relatively greater than those of
the catalysts using the hot-air method. When comparing the catalysts
prepared using different templates with identical preparation techniques
and wt % of template, all GLC yields of the catalysts prepared using
the G template were higher than those using the PVP template. It was
also evident that with increasing amounts of the template, the GLC
yields increased until reaching a maximum yield at 30 wt % for both
templates and both preparation techniques. With further increases
in the amounts of the template (50 and 70 wt % of template), the activities
of the catalysts gradually decreased. The superior catalyst was 30G-S,
yielding GLC at 26.5%. It should be noted that every catalyst tested
under the operating conditions achieved 100% GLC selectivity. The
reasons for these results were associated with the physicochemical
properties of the catalysts, which are discussed in the next section.

molar ratio = 1:3, T = 30 °C, t = 120 min.

3.2 Characterization
of NaAlO2 Catalysts
Prepared by Different Methods
The selected catalysts, including
the catalysts prepared using the spray-drying method and the conventional
hot-air method with 0 and 30 wt % of G or the PVP template and the
commercial catalyst, were characterized using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), N2-physisorption, TGA analysis, XRD, and CO2-TPD. The characterization results in relation to the catalytic
activity are discussed in this section. Note that only the necessary
selected catalysts were chosen to be characterized using the characterization
techniques mentioned above. The catalysts with 0 wt % of template
represented the reference catalysts without a template for the hot-air
and spray-drying methods and the catalysts with 30 wt % of each template
represented the optimal catalysts for each preparation method.

The surface morphologies of NaAlO2 catalysts prepared
using the spray-drying method and the conventional hot-air method
with and without a template are displayed in Figure 2. PVP or glycerol was mixed with the NaAlO2 solution at 30 wt % of the weight of NaAlO2. PVP
or glycerol was expected to provide different pore sizes after removing
the templates through calcination. It can be clearly seen from the
figure that 0-S is spherical with a diameter of about 10 μm
without small pores on its surface, whereas 0-HA is irregular in shape
and highly nonuniform in size with a particle size ranging from approximately
2 μm to 6 μm. Moreover, it can be seen that 30PVP-S and
30G-S were spherical and their sizes were approximately identical—about
10 μm. What was most interesting was that each spherical particle
had a similar porous structure. However, the pores of 30PVP-S were
clearly larger than those of 30G-S because PVP, unlike glycerol, is
a type of polymer, and a PVP molecule is much larger than one of glycerol.
Thus, any catalyst that is prepared using PVP as the template has
substantially larger pores than those prepared using glycerol. Both
30PVP-HA and 30G-HA were irregularly shaped, but the internal pore
sizes of 30PVP-HA were larger than those of 30G-S, as was the case
with 30PVP-S and 30G-S, mentioned above.

Figure 2 SEM images of NaAlO2 catalysts prepared using conventional
hot air (HA) or spray-drying (S) methods with and without PVP or glycerol
(G) as a template.

The measurements of the
BET surface area and average pore diameter
of each prepared catalyst compared with those of the commercial catalyst
are presented in Table 1. As expected, the BET surfaces of 0-HA and 0-S were relatively low—approximately
1–3 m2/g. Their pore diameter was also very low,
as they are a nonporous material, as suggested by the SEM images in Figure 2. The highest BET
surface area was recorded for 30G-S (9.5 m2/g), owing to
its high porosity. The commercial NaAlO2 catalyst had a
BET surface area of 4.0 m2/g. The ranking from the highest
to the lowest of the BET surface area was: 30G-S, 30PVP-S, 30G-HA,
30PVP-HA, commercial, 0-HA, and 0-S. These results indicated that
using templates successfully increased the surface area of pure NaAlO2 (the commercial NaAlO2 catalyst) by creating pores
after calcination. Moreover, the catalysts prepared using the spray-drying
method with a template were able to slightly increase the surface
area of NaAlO2, compared to the catalysts prepared using
the conventional hot-air method. By contrast, the catalysts with 0
wt % of template had the lowest surface areas, probably due to the
formation of large particles without pore formation after drying and
calcination of pure NaAlO2, thereby producing the lowest
activities as presented in Figure 1.

analysis (see Figure S1a–d).

Although the BET surface areas of
the catalysts prepared using
the conventional hot-air method did not substantially improve the
surface area, this process was highly beneficial from various aspects.
For example, it took much less time to dry the catalyst, thereby saving
energy and cost. Furthermore, the homogeneity of the mixture vastly
improved, and the catalyst could be produced at a high rate. Moreover,
a uniform particle size and shape could be obtained, and the particle
size of the catalyst can be controlled. In addition, a uniformly spherical
particle is usually more resistant to attrition compared to an irregularly
sized and shaped particle.35 Lastly, the
number of steps required for catalyst preparation was reduced as there
was no need for grinding.

The thermal decomposition behaviors
of the two selected NaAlO2 samples (the uncalcined 30G-S
and the uncalcined 30PVP-S)
were compared with that of the uncalcined 0-S using TGA, as presented
in Figure 3. The thermogram
profile of the uncalcined 30G-S exhibited two stages of weight loss.
An initial weight loss was detected in the temperature range of 100–190
°C; this loss was attributed to the removal of residual water
from the sample. The second weight loss was detected at 340–400
°C and was attributed to the decomposition of the glycerol template.
Similarly, the thermogram profile of the uncalcined 30PVP-S also exhibited
four stages of weight loss. The first stage (100–240 °C)
was attributed to the removal of residual water, whereas the second
and third stages (300 and 380 °C) were attributed to the removal
of the low molecular weight oligomers. The last stage occurred at
670 °C, representing the composition of PVP.36 Following this, no weight loss was recorded for either
sample. For the uncalcined 0-S, only the first stage was seen in the
temperature range 100–190 °C because of the loss of residual
water. The results from these thermograms confirmed that the templates
could be completely eliminated from the catalysts after they had been
calcined at 700 °C. In addition, coke formation of 30PVP-S and
30G-S after calcination was investigated using the TGA–differential
thermal analysis (DTA) technique as presented in Figure S2. There was no clear DTA peak in the temperature
range of 400–600 °C37, indicating the decomposition of carbonaceous materials such that
the coke in both catalysts was also removed after the calcination.

Figure 3 TGA (solid
lines) and DTA (dashed lines) thermogram profiles of
uncalcined 30G-S, uncalcined 30PVP-S, and uncalcined NaAlO2 without the template.

The XRD diffraction patterns of the selected catalysts shown
in Figure 2 are shown
in Figure 4. All the
selected
catalysts consisted mainly of a crystalline phase of NaAlO2 and Na2CO3, as evidenced from the characteristic
peaks of 2θ = 20.8, 21.2, 30.4, 33.3, 34.4, 35.0, 42.4, 46.6,
48.7, 52.0, 57.7, 62.0, 63.8, and 68.9 (ICDD = 00-033-1200) and 2θ
= 33.3, 37.8, 46.6, and 62.0 (ICDD = 00-001-1166), respectively. Moreover,
0-HA exhibited high-intensity peaks of NaAlO2·1.25H2O (2θ = 18.8 (ICDD = 00-044-0430)), but these characteristic
peaks of the NaAlO2·1.25H2O phase were
barely observed in other catalysts, indicating that using the template
method to prepare the catalysts was able to largely reduce the NaAlO2·1.25H2O phases. This was probably because
after 0-HA was calcined, the sample totally collapsed into only large
and nonporous particles, and it had to be ground before being used.
Thus, the phase transformation probably does not occur throughout
the material, especially well inside the bulk material. Unlike the
catalysts prepared by using templates and/or a spray-dryer, many porous
spaces using templates or small particles from using a spray-dryer
are obtained; thus, the heat distribution and diffusion of gases during
the calcination process potentially enhance the phase transformation.

Figure 4 XRD patterns
of Na2AlO2 catalysts prepared
using different methods.

The basicity of the selected catalysts, shown in Figure 1, was assessed using
CO2-TPD, as presented in Figure 5. As can be seen, each catalyst had one large
peak
around 600–850 °C. This peak was classified as a strong
basic site, which could be related to the generation of O2-species. The estimated peak area of the strong basic site of each
catalyst was determined as shown in Table S1, with the relative ranking as: 30G-S > 30PVP-S > 30G-HA >
30PVP-HA
> 0-HA > 0-S. This related well to the ranking orders of surface
area
and catalytic activity and suggested that the increases in the NaAlO2 catalysts resulted from the increases in the amount of adsorbed
CO2 or the number of basic sites, thereby increasing the
activity of the catalysts.

Figure 5 CO2-TPD patterns of Na2AlO2 catalysts
prepared using different methods.

In summary, the SEM image (Figure 2), the BET surface area analysis (Table 1), and the CO2-TPD
(Figure 5) measurements
of 30G-S indicated that 30G-S is commonly spherical with a particle
diameter of approximately 10 μm, possessing mesopores with an
average pore diameter of 39.6 nm. Moreover, it had a surface area
of 9.5 m2/g—the highest among the prepared catalysts.
More importantly, the surface basicity of this catalyst was relatively
greater than those for the other catalysts. These results indicated
that the surface area and the surface basicity of the catalyst strongly
influenced the catalytic activity, which is consistent with a previous
report.29 However, the difference in particle
shape had a weak effect on the GLC yield. Moreover, it was found that
the catalysts prepared using the spray-drying method had a slightly
higher yield of GLC than those prepared using the conventional hot-air
method probably because the diffusion limitation of the reactants
and the products for the uniformly spherical particles was of less
concern compared to that of the irregularly shaped particles. Thus,
both 30G-S and 30PVP-S were selected to further study the effects
of the operating conditions on the reaction.

3.3 Effects
of Operating Conditions on GLC Production
of 30G-S and 30PVP-S
Before the effects of operating conditions
were examined, the effect of calcination temperature in the range
500–700 °C for 30G-S on the catalyst performance were
predetermined, to ensure that no other calcination temperatures could
result in a much greater GLC yield. This range of the calcination
temperature was chosen because the glycerol template was completely
removed above 500 °C (see Figure 3) and so there was no need to investigate the effect
of the calcination temperature on the catalyst performance in this
range for 30PVP-S because the PVP template required a temperature
greater than 670 °C. The results (see Figure S3) showed that no substantial change or improvement of the
GLC yield was achieved and the highest GLC yield was obtained at 700
°C. Thus, the results of 30G-S and 30PVP-S presented in this
section were determined using a calcination temperature of 700 °C.
The operating parameters of catalyst weight, reactant molar ratio,
reaction temperature, and reaction time are discussed in detail below.

3.3.1 Catalyst Concentration
The effect
of catalyst concentration on the transesterification of glycerol over
30G-S and 30PVP-S is illustrated in Figure 6. The concentrations of each catalyst varied
from 5 to 40 wt % of glycerol. As can be observed from the figure,
the GLC yields steadily increased for both catalysts from 5 to 30
wt %. Both catalysts achieved the maximum GLC yield at the same concentration
(30 wt %)—26.5% GLC yield for 30G-S and 21.3% yield for 30PVP-S.
Above 30 wt % catalyst concentration, the GLC yields decreased. This
phenomenon can be simply explained by the increase in the catalyst
concentration providing more active sites for the reaction. However,
an excessive concentration of the catalyst resulted in the mass transfer
resistance in the liquid–solid phase system,15,29 thereby reducing the GLC yield.

Figure 6 Effect of the catalyst amount on transesterification
of glycerol.
Reaction conditions; glycerol/DMC molar ratio = 1:3, T = 30 °C, t = 120 min.

3.3.2 Glycerol/DMC Molar Ratio
The catalysts
30G-S and 30PVP-S for the transesterification of glycerol were further
investigated by varying glycerol—the DMC molar ratio was altered
from 1:3 to 1:7. The results are presented in Figure 7. The maximum glycerol/DMC molar ratios of
30G-S and 30PVP-S were 1:4 and 1:5, producing GLC yields of 32.3 and
29.2%, respectively. At higher glycerol-DMC molar ratios, the GLC
yields slowly decreased.

Figure 7 Effect of glycerol to the DMC ratio on transesterification
of glycerol.
Reaction conditions: catalyst amount = 30 wt %, T = 30 °C, t = 120 min.

Generally, the stoichiometric ratio of glycerol to DMC for
the
transesterification reaction is 1 mol of glycerol to 1 mol of DMC
to produce 1 mol of GLC. Because of the immiscibility between hydrophilic
glycerol and hydrophobic DMC and the reversibility of the transesterification
reaction, the operation of the reaction normally requires an excess
amount of DMC to increase the conversion of glycerol and the GLC yield9,15,38 because using an excessive amount
of DMC compared to glycerol (more than two times) can help in preventing
the two-phase formation between the two reactants.15,29,39 However, at a relatively high glycerol/DMC
molar ratio, DMC produced a dilution effect on the reaction.

3.3.3 Reaction Temperature
The effect
of reaction temperature on the activity of the transesterification
of glycerol over 30G-S and 30PVP-S is presented in Figure 8. An increase in the reaction
temperature from 30 to 75 °C increased the GLC yield for both
catalysts—from 32.3 to 86.1% for 30G-S and from 29.2 to 78.4%
for 30PVP-S—because increasing the reaction temperature led
to a decrease in the viscosity of the glycerol/DMC mixture and increased
the miscibility of the reactants.17,38,40 More importantly, the reaction temperature strongly
affected the kinetic rate of the reaction. As this reaction is an
endothermic reaction, more products are obtained when the reaction
temperature is increased. Moreover, it can be noticed from the figure
that the GLC yields of 30G-S for every temperature increase was higher
than that for 30PVP-S, probably because of the diffusion and porosity
effects, described in Section 3.2. It is important to note that when the reaction was
carried out above 75 °C, the DMC evaporated rapidly (even in
the reflux setup), maybe because the reaction temperature was too
close to the boiling point of DMC (90 °C). Consequently, a reaction
temperature below 75 °C is preferred.

Figure 8 Effect of reaction temperature
on the transesterification of glycerol.
Reaction conditions: glycerol/DMC molar ratio = 1:4 for 30G-S and
1:5 for 30PVP-S, glycerol: catalyst amount = 30 wt %, t = 120 min.

3.3.4 Reaction
Time
Reaction time is
an important parameter for the transesterification of glycerol. Figure 9 shows the effect
of reaction time on the transesterification of glycerol using 30G-S
and 30PVP-S for 5 h. It can be seen from the figure that both 30G-S
and 30PVP-S yielded the maximum GLC at 2 h, (85.3 and 76.0%, respectively).
At 3 h, the GLC yields and selectivities of both catalysts minimally
changed from the maximum values, and then remained stable until the
last hour. Importantly, the GLC selectivity remained 100% to the last
hour, which was confirmed using 1H NMR (see Figure S4).

of glycerol.
Reaction conditions: glycerol/DMC molar ratio = 1:4 for 30G-S and
1:5 for 30PVP-S, catalyst amount = 30 wt %, T = 70
°C.

3.4 Catalyst
Reusability of 30G-S
Catalyst
reusability is an important factor that should be considered when
using the catalyst for commercial purposes. Figure 10 shows the reusability of 30G-S for the
transesterification of glycerol over five cycles. After each cycle,
the catalyst was washed in methanol and dried at 115 °C for 1
h. As can be observed from the figure, the GLC yield slowly decreased
after each consecutive reaction. After five cycles, the GLC yield
had reduced from 85.3 to 69.0%. The surface morphology of the catalyst
used for five cycles was examined using SEM and the crystalline phase
using XRD, as illustrated in Figures 11 and 12. The analyses revealed
that the crystalline phases of the catalyst changed minimally, but
the surface morphology changed greatly from spherical particles to
the irregular ones with lower observed porosity. Consequently, possibly
the change or the collapse of the catalyst structure slowly deactivated
the catalyst. The BET surface area of the catalyst used for five cycles
was 5.7 m2/g, which was lower than that for the fresh catalyst.
This confirmed that the pores in the catalyst had collapsed.

of 30G-S for the transesterification of glycerol. Reaction
conditions: glycerol/DMC molar ratio = 1:4 for 30G-S, catalyst amount
= 30 wt %, T = 70 °C, t = 120
min.

Figure 12 XRD spectra of fresh and used 30G-S.

In addition, another experiment
was used to investigate catalyst
reusability to see if it was possible to maintain the original catalytic
activity41 by repeating the first cycle
experiment under identical conditions as shown in Figure 9, followed by reducing the
reaction time to 5 min in the experiments of cycle numbers 2–5.
Note that the catalyst was not washed with any solvent after each
cycle and was only separated from the crude by centrifugation before
drying in a hot-air oven at 115 °C for 1 h. The results are shown
in Figure S5. The activity of the catalyst
dropped quickly in the second and the third cycles of the experiment,
perhaps because the pores in the catalyst were blocked by residual
reactants or as a result of collapsing as observed in Figure 11. For the fourth and the fifth
cycles of the experiment, the GLC yields were virtually unchanged
at approximately 35%, or 2.4 times lower than the initial activity
of 30G-S.

Furthermore, the catalyst leaching of 30G-S was determined
using
a hot filtration test. The test was undertaken using the reaction
conditions shown in Figure 10 (the first cycle of the experiment). After 120 min, the solid
catalyst was separated from the liquid using a filter paper (Whatman
No. 1), then washed with warm ethanol (70 °C). The solid catalyst
was dried at 115 °C for 1 h followed by calcination at 700 °C
for 6 h. The weight of the leftover catalyst was 3.7% lower than the
weight of the catalyst before the reaction. Moreover, analysis of
the liquid part by stirring at 115 °C overnight and then burning
it in an air furnace at 700 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of
1 °C/min produced a small amount of a white solid powder. XRD
analysis of the powder (Figure S6), showed
there were similar XRD peaks to those presented in Figure 12, indicating that leaching
of the catalyst occurred during the reaction.

4 Conclusions
A NaAlO2 catalyst was developed using
PVP or G as the
catalyst template to increase its surface area. In addition, the effects
of the conventional hot-air and spray-drying methods on the transesterification
of glycerol to GLC were investigated. PVP and G increased the surface
area of the bulk NaAlO2. The 30PVP-S and 30G-S catalysts
possessed uniform spherical particles with internal porous structures,
whereas 30PVP-HA and 30G-HA exhibited irregular porous particles and
were highly nonuniform in size and shape. More importantly, the catalysts
prepared using the spray-drying method produced a relatively higher
GLC yield than those prepared using the conventional drying method.
Furthermore, the surface area, pore size, and size distribution substantially
influenced the formation of GLC. The GLC yield was optimized with
30G-S having maximum activity at 30 wt % of the glycerol used with
a glycerol/DMC ratio of 1:4 at 70 °C for 2 h, resulting in a
GLC yield of 85% with 100% GLC selectivity. Compared with the other
catalysts, (see Table S2), 30G-S had a
promising GLC yield at a relatively low reaction temperature, although
a relatively high catalyst loading was used. Nevertheless, the catalyst
encountered leaching, which requires further investigation so that
it can be prevented before practical applications. In short, this
work has proposed a green route to transform glycerol into a high
value-added chemical using a spherical, porous NaAlO2 catalyst.
Using the spray-drying technique to prepare the catalyst proved to
be highly advantageous; moreover, it is more convenient compared to
the conventional hot-air drying method and is practical for industrial
uses.
