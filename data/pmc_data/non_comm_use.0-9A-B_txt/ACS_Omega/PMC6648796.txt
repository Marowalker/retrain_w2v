Anticounterfeiting materials are
neo-advanced materials with utility
in covert and security strategies. In this context, a photoluminescent,
mechanically robust, and thermally stable hyperbranched polyurethane
(PU) nanocomposite was fabricated with oxygeneous-graphitic carbon
nitride nanodots. The nanocomposite was characterized using infrared,
ultraviolet–visible, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray
diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric
analysis. The processed nanocomposite demonstrated improved physico-mechanical
stability as well as enhanced thermal stability than the pristine
PU. The nanocomposite displayed remarkable photoluminescence under
long ultraviolet light (365 nm), courtesy of dispersion of oxygeneous-carbon
nitride nanodots in the polymer matrix, without any solid-state quenching.
The nanocomposite was consequently employed as an ultraviolet light-detectable
anticounterfeiting ink material having reinforcing ability.

==== Body
Introduction
Polyurethanes (PUs) have come a long way
since their initial development
by Bayer and co-workers in the 1930s.1 PUs
display the hallmarks of an ideal polymer matrix, owing to their lightweight
nature, better mechanical strength, and chemical resistance than most
of their polymeric counterparts.2 This
has led to a diversity of PUs being developed for common applications
such as coatings, paints, adhesives, and foams. However, in the last
few decades, the focus of PU synthesis has welcomingly shifted from
petrochemical-based precursors to biobased precursors, making them
more economically feasible and environmentally benign.3 Further, new innovations in the field of PUs have been
ushered by the development of hyperbranched PUs (HPUs). In recent
times, HPUs have received significant attention because of their unique
attributes such as three-dimensional architecture, low solution and
melt viscosity, high solubility, high reactivity, good compatibility
with others, and so forth,4 which gives
them distinct edge over the linear PUs in terms of structural versatility,
processability, and material properties. Also, the fact that HPUs
can be designed using biobased precursors makes them an inexpensive
and ecofriendly commodity.5,6 However, insufficiencies
in achieving the desired material properties have restricted their
exploitation in advanced applications. There have been various concepts
such as blending7−9 and interpenetrating networks10−12 with aromatic
or similar polymers to improve the material properties of HPUs, although
with complicated procedures and processing difficulties. Therefore,
improving the material properties of HPUs by simple and inexpensive
techniques is a lucrative challenge before their utilization for advanced
applications.

Recent studies have confirmed that the material
properties of pristine
polymers can be drastically improved by the formation of polymer nanocomposites
with suitable nanomaterials.13−16 In addition, these nanomaterials can also impart
special properties to the polymers, which may not be otherwise achieved
by the pure polymeric material alone.16−18 Especially, carbon-based
nanomaterials with their myriad properties have carved out a niche
for themselves that can be exploited to build polymeric nanocomposites
for various applications.19−21 In this context, graphitic carbon
nitride is a new emerging nanomaterial that has attracted considerable
interest in recent years because of its similarity to graphene.22 Graphitic carbon nitride consists of a prebonded
C–N core motif that imparts unique features, viz., thermal
stability, chemical stability, optical property, electrochemical property,
surface property, etc.23 Variants of graphitic
carbon nitride in the form of nanosheets and nanodots have found widespread
applications as photocatalysts, electrochemical sensors, energy storage
devices, environmental remediators, and so forth.22,23 From this perspective, graphitic carbon nitride due to its uncanny
structural similarity to graphene can be thereby utilized as a nanoreinforcing
agent for improving the properties of polymers. However, until date,
there have been very few reports on their use in polymer nanocomposites.
For instance, Zhu et al. reported the development of graphitic carbon
nitride nanosheet-reinforced polyimide nanocomposites with enhanced
mechanical and tribological properties.24 Xu et al. demonstrated graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet-reinforced
poly(urea-urethane) nanocomposites with self-healing and anticorrosive
properties.25 Thus, there is plenty of
scope for graphitic carbon nitride with its unique structural features
and attractive set of properties to be applied as reinforcing materials
for polymer nanocomposites.

Again, in the current times, counterfeiting
has become a rising
issue worldwide for industries, governments, and customers. With the
recent development and generalization of high-end equipment, counterfeited
items have become more common, creating problem for the society.26 For example, the circulation of counterfeited
paper currency leads to serious socioeconomic problems as well as
undervalued authentic currency;27,28 production and distribution
of counterfeited drugs pose severe health hazard, as they may contain
unknown or incorrect amount of chemicals.29,30 In this context, anticounterfeiting has become a vital innovation
for protecting important and valuable items that should not be replicated
such as currency, documents, certificates, brands, luxury items, and
tickets.31 During the past decade, an array
of anticounterfeiting technologies have been developed to tackle counterfeiting.
However, the counterfeiters have been successful in adapting to the
current methods, which makes it imperative to develop new materials
and innovative tools to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In this
perspective, functional materials having distinct physical, chemical,
or optical properties can be expected to provide anticounterfeiting
measures because of difficulties associated with reproduction of their
unique functions.32 Especially, photoluminescent
materials with specific excitation and specific mode emission properties
are considered to be good strategy for anticounterfeiting applications.
Photoluminescent anticounterfeiting appliances based on optical materials
such as semiconductor quantum dots,33 carbon
quantum dots,34 lanthanide-doped materials,35 and so forth have been developed recently. In
this context, graphitic carbon nitride nanodots, with their excellent
optical and photoluminescent properties, can serve as an ideal material
for constructing anticounterfeiting materials that show specific excitation/emission
properties. These photoluminescent nanodots combined with the unique
attributes of biobased HPUs can forge a suitable material that is
not only robust and ecofriendly but also intricate in its design.
The design of such high-performance photoluminescent nanocomposites
can be a prototype for coatings, labelings, and ink-jet printing with
anticounterfeiting measures.

Thus, the current work describes
the development of nanocomposites
of bioderived HPU with oxygeneous-graphitic carbon nitride nanodots
acting as a nano-reinforcing material. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on the fabrication of HPU nanocomposite with
graphitic carbon nitride nanodots. The influence of the oxygeneous-graphitic
carbon nitride nanodots as a reinforcing agent on the mechanical and
thermal properties of the nanocomposite was studied. In addition,
the performance of the nanocomposite as an anticounterfeiting tool
was demonstrated.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
of Oxygeneous-Graphitic Carbon
Nitride Nanodots (Oxy-gCNDs)
Oxy-gCNDs were prepared by microwave
pyrolysis of guanidine hydrochloride and sodium citrate in basic aqueous
medium as illustrated in Scheme 1. In recent times, guanidine hydrochloride has emerged
as a popular choice for the synthesis of graphitic carbon nitride
because of its low cost, nitrogen-rich, and highly reactive nature.31 Consequently, guanidine hydrochloride was chosen
as the principal precursor. Sodium citrate played the role of surface
passivating and stabilizing agent, as it contains ample carboxylic
groups and hydroxyl group that helps in controlling the size and morphology
of carbon nitride nanodots. Further, microwave pyrolysis offers the
benefit of simultaneous, homogeneous, and expeditious heating, leading
to uniform size distribution of the nanodots.31 As reported in the earlier work, the mechanism of formation of carbon
nitride nanodots is presumed to follow a rapid pathway of cyclization
and polymerization involving the precursors to give the graphitic
carbon nitride core made up of tri-s-triazine motif.20,21

Scheme 1 Preparation of Oxy-gCNDs
Preliminary investigations revealed that oxy-gCNDs possess
a yellow
amorphous appearance and hygroscopic nature. These oxy-gCNDs were
found to have high dispersibility (nano-level) in water but very poor
dispersibility in most of the organic solvents. The hygroscopic nature
and high aqueous dispersibility indicated proper surface passivation
or functionalization of graphitic carbon nitride core by oxygeneous
functional groups. Remarkably, these oxy-gCNDs exhibited high stability
and good dispersibility in water even after exposure to ambient conditions
for several months, without any signs of agglomeration. Similar to
most carbon quantum nanodots, these highly water dispersible oxy-gCNDs
displayed bright cyan photoluminescence under long UV light (365 nm
wavelength) with good photostability even after several months on
benchtop. UV–visible spectral analysis of oxy-gCNDs showed
an intense absorption band centered at 235 nm, corresponding to π
→ π* electronic transition of the tri-s-triazine motif of graphitic carbon nitride.31 Additionally, a broad continuous absorption was observed in the
range of 280–490 nm, which can be attributed to n →
π* electronic transitions originating from surface passivating
functional groups of oxy-gCNDs. Photoluminescence (PL) study of oxy-gCNDs
showed a narrow and symmetrical maximum PL emission peak centered
at 445 nm upon excitation at 360 nm, which can be held responsible
for the bright cyan PL emission. Notably, the quantum yield of oxy-gCNDs
(λex = 360 nm) was measured to be 19% using quinine
sulfate as a standard.32 The PL emission
peak was observed to be red-shifted relative to the maximum absorbance
band of oxy-gCNDs (Figure 1a). Furthermore, oxy-gCNDs revealed notable variations in
PL emission, as the PL emission peak was red-shifted from 435 to 475
nm, while its intensity increased and then decreased gradually upon
varying the excitation wavelength from 320 to 420 nm (Figure 1b). These results suggested
that oxy-gCNDs exhibited excitation wavelength-dependent PL behavior,
owing to the effects of optical selection of differently sized nanoparticles
(quantum confinement effect) and considerable distribution of emissive
trap sites on the oxy-gCND surface, similar to most of carbon quantum
dots.36 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis showed that the as-prepared oxy-gCNDs were monodispersed
and possessed spherical morphology. Statistical analysis showed that
these nanodots were distributed in the range of 1–3 nm with
an average diameter of 2.2 nm (Figure 1c). Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared
(ATR–FTIR) spectral analysis showed the characteristic band
at 815 cm–1 corresponding to the tri-s-triazine motif of graphitic carbon nitride31,37 and prominent bands around 1535, 1451, and 1390 cm–1 attributed to typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles.37 Additionally, occurrence of an intense sharp
band at 1627 cm–1, corresponding to asymmetric stretching
vibration of carboxylate anions, and two nearby bands at 3277 and
3150 cm–1, corresponding to N–H stretching
of the primary amine group, coupled with O–H stretching of
hydroxyl groups, further suggested the passivation of carboxylic and
hydroxyl groups on the surface of oxy-gCNDs (Figure 1d).

Fabrication and Characterization of Bioderived HPU/Oxy-gCND
Nanocomposite (HPUNC)
HPUNCs were fabricated by an Ax + By (x,y ≥ 2) polymerization
technique using castor oil-modified polyol (COMP) as the branching
moiety and varying loadings of oxy-gCNDs as the nano-reinforcing agent
as shown in Scheme 2. Formation of the HPU nanocomposite depends on several factors,
most notably the concentration of reactants and dispersion of the
nanomaterial in the polymer matrix.38

Scheme 2 In Situ Fabrication of  HPU/Oxy-gCND Nanocomposite
The concentration of the reactants,
especially the branching moiety,
was maintained by dilution with solvent during the polymerization
reaction. This strategy allowed the smooth completion of the reaction
without any gel formation, which is a usually encountered problem
during the formation of a hyperbranched polymer. Further, uniform
dispersion of the nanomaterial in the polymer matrix is an important
condition for the formation of a polymeric nanocomposite.38 The nano-reinforcing agent was properly dispersed
in solvent by ultrasonication prior to its addition in the polymerization
reaction. Oxy-gCNDs, by virtue of their surface passivating functional
groups, formed a stable dispersion in dimethylformamide (DMF) for
a short time, allowing timely addition in the reaction. Moreover,
the nano-reinforcing agent was judiciously added to the prepolymer
in the beginning of the second step with vigorous mechanical shearing
force. This tactic aided the formation of a uniformly dispersed nanocomposite.

A comparison of the ATR–FTIR spectra of the initial prepolymer,
HPU, and HPUNC revealed key changes in chemical functionalities, which
suggested the formation of the PU linkages, as illustrated in Figure 2a. The FTIR of the
prepolymer revealed the appearance of bands of −NH stretching
at 3421 cm–1 and free −C=O band at
1736 cm–1 prominently, along with free isocyanate
(−NCO) band at 2260 cm–1, indicating the
formation of the isocyanate-terminated PU prepolymer as depicted in
the first step of the fabrication process in Scheme 2. The bands of PU further became more conclusive
and prominent in the FTIR of HPU and HPUNC after the second step of
the fabrication process in Scheme 2. The broad band centered at 3362 cm–1 was attributed to N–H stretching vibration of the urethane
linkage, coupled with O–H stretching vibration. The sharp band
at 1724 cm–1 juxtaposed with the weak band at 1640
cm–1 was alluded to free C=O and H-bonded
C=O stretching vibration of urethane linkage, respectively.
Further, the medium intensity band at 1530 cm–1 was
attributed to the coupled vibrations of N–H bending and C–N
stretching of the urethane linkage, whereas the medium intensity band
at 1240 cm–1 was ascribed to the C–O–C
stretching vibrations of the urethane linkage. At the same time, the
medium intensity band at 1045 cm–1 was ascribed
to the C–O stretching vibration of the urethane linkage. Additional
bands were observed prominently at 2938 and 2865 cm–1 corresponding to the asymmetric and symmetric C–H stretching
vibrations of −CH2 and −CH3 groups
of the PU chain segments. Other C–H modes of vibrations, resulting
from the chain segments of HPUNC, were also observed distinctly in
the spectra at 1465 cm–1 (−CH2 scissoring coupled with −CH3 asymmetric deformation),
1366 cm–1 (−CH3 symmetric deformation),
1295 cm–1 (−CH2 wagging), and
730 cm–1 (−CH2 rocking in long
aliphatic chains). Most notably, the band observed for free −NCO
group at 2260 cm–1 disappeared completely, suggesting
complete and quantitative formation of HPUNC.

HPUNCs; (c) high-resolution transmission electron microscopy of HPUNC1.0
at the magnification of 5 nm.

X-ray diffractograms of HPUNCs as shown in Figure 2b clearly indicated the presence
of crystallinity.
Two strong diffractions peaks were observed at 2θ = 21.5°
(calculated d-spacing of 4.12 Å) and 2θ
= 23.8° (calculated d-spacing of 3.73 Å)
because of (110) and (200) planes of the crystalline poly(ε-caprolactone)diol
(PCL) moiety,39 respectively. In addition,
enhancement in the peak intensity of the PCL moiety with incorporation
of a nano-reinforcing agent was observed. This enhancement can be
attributed to the good nano-reinforcing effect of the oxy-gCNDs. This
nano-reinforcing ability was reflective of the strong physico–chemical
interactions between the near-graphitic nanomaterial and the crystalline
segments of the polymer chains. Further, the nanocomposites displayed
slight enhancement of peak intensity upon increasing the loading capacity
of the nano-reinforcing agent. Calculation of % crystallinity of HPUNCs
using peak integration function in Origin 8.5 affirmed this observation
with corresponding values of 22.1% (0.5 wt %), 22.6% (1.0 wt %), and
23.5% (2.0 wt %) compared to that of 21.95% of only pure HPU. Hence,
it can be stated that as the loading of oxy-gCNDs increased in the
polymer matrix, the extent of these physico–chemical interactions
also increased, imparting better reinforcement of HPUNC. TEM images
of HPUNC in Figure 2c revealed the consistent dispersion of oxy-gCNDs (red circles) in
the HPU matrix.

Mechanical Properties of HPUNCs
The mechanical properties
of HPUNCs were evaluated and demonstrated in Table 1. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength,
elongation at break, toughness, scratch hardness, and impact strength
were significantly improved even at very low nanomaterial loading.
Further, the nanocomposites displayed loading-dependent improvement
of mechanical properties. The stress–strain profile of HPUNCs
and HPU shown in Figure 3a, as well as the effect of nanomaterial loading on tensile strength,
elongation at break, and toughness, shown in Figure 3b–d, highlighted the reinforcing effect
of oxy-gCNDs.

c Calculated by
converting into energy
unit as per thickness between 0.43 and 0.45 mm.

The tensile strength of the nanocomposite
improved gradually on
increasing the nano-reinforcing agent loading from 0.5 to 2.0 wt %,
showing maximum enhancement up to 1.9-fold. At the same time, elongation
at break of the nanocomposite also improved slightly on gradual increase
of nano-reinforcing agent loading, displaying maximum enhancement
up to 1.2-fold. The values of toughness, calculated by integrating
the area under curve from the stress–strain profile of HPUNCs,
also showed improvement up to 2.5-fold with increasing nano-reinforcing
agent loading. Further, the nanocomposite displayed improved values
of scratch hardness and impact resistance, which could not be precisely
quantified as they exceeded the maximum limit of the instruments.
This improvement in the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites
can be solely attributed to the presence of the oxy-gCNDs in the HPU
matrix and strong interfacial interactions existing between them.
At this juncture, it is pertinent to know that carbon nanostructures
can act as a very good reinforcing material for polymers because of
their structural stability and compatibility.40 In this context, oxy-gCNDs served the role of a suitable nano-reinforcing
agent, as they possess a formidable semi-carbonized structural motif
as well as various surface passivating functional groups which provided
rigidity and flexibility to the polymer matrix by participating in
various physico–chemical interactions within the polymer matrix.
These oxy-gCNDs reinforcing the HPU matrix hence contributed to its
high performance.

Recent state-of-art literature endorses the
reinforcing role of
such carbon quantum nanodot-like materials with various polymeric
materials. For example, Gobi and co-workers showed that incorporation
of 2.5 wt % of graphene quantum dots in an epoxy resin led to a 2.25-fold
increase in tensile strength, 1.18-fold increase in nominal strain
at break, and 2.6-fold increase in toughness.41 In another instance, Zhang and co-workers reported that inclusion
of 2 wt % carbon quantum dots in an epoxy resin polymer resulted in
1.39-fold increment in tensile modulus.42 Seminal works done by the author’s group toward the development
of high-performance hyperbranched polymer nanocomposites with carbon
quantum dot nanomaterials are also noteworthy. For instance, a hyperbranched
epoxy resin nanocomposite with 1 wt % carbon dots showed improvement
of 1.22-fold in tensile strength, 1.21-fold in elongation at break,
and 1.17-fold in toughness;43 a hyperbranched
waterborne PU nanocomposite containing 1 wt % of carbon dots displayed
enhancements of 1.8-fold in tensile strength and 1.41-fold in elongation
at break;44 a hyperbranched waterborne
polyester nanocomposite containing 1 wt % carbon dots demonstrated
very high enhancements of 6.02-fold in tensile strength and 2.8-fold
in toughness.45 In overall, these reports
reiterated the role of carbon quantum nanodots as capable reinforcing
agents for polymers and substantiated the results observed for HPUNCs.

Thermal Properties of HPUNCs
The thermal properties
of HPUNCs were evaluated by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The TG
curves of HPUNCs along with HPU and oxy-gCNDs are shown in Figure 4. The nanocomposites
displayed slight and gradual improvement in thermal degradation temperature
at a very low loading of nano-reinforcing agent. In addition, all
the nanocomposites displayed enhancement of degradation temperatures
corresponding to the loading of the nano-reinforcing agent (Table 2). This enhancement
in thermal degradation temperatures can be mainly attributed to the
presence of oxy-gCND nano-reinforcing agent in the HPU matrix and
their reinforcing effect on the matrix. Here, it is pertinent to mention
that graphitic carbon nitride possesses a host of unique properties
including excellent thermal stability, owing to it near-graphitic
core structure.22 Therefore, the dispersion
of oxy-gCNDs in the polymer matrix imparted a stabilizing effect on
the polymer matrix by absorbing the thermal energy in its core. In
addition, reinforcement of the HPU matrix by oxy-gCNDs led to occupation
of free volume available in the matrix, thereby restricting the arbitrary
motion of the polymeric chains under thermal energy. This reinforcement
ultimately imparted resistance to the degradation of the polymer matrix.

Anticounterfeiting
Application
HPUNC was dispersible
in polar aprotic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF),
dimethylsulfoxide, and so forth, displaying a light yellow transparent
solution. This solution transparency can be attributed to both the
aliphatic nature of the HPU matrix and quantum size effect of the
oxy-gCNDs. In addition, the dispersed nanocomposite was found to exhibit
bright cyan photoluminescence, owing to the presence of oxy-gCNDs
in the polymer matrix. The transparency and photoluminescent property
of HPUNC make the corresponding dispersion an attractive material
for anticounterfeiting, as such materials are hard to replicate and
process. As shown in Figure 5a, the HPUNC dispersion in xylene is light yellow in
color in daylight but emits bright cyan emission under long UV light
(365 nm). This dispersion can be loaded into a gel/sketch pen refill
and used directly as ink. To demonstrate the performance of HPUNC
as an anticounterfeiting ink, the characters “TU” and
“APNL” were written on a commercially available filter
paper and the characters “HPUNC” written on a sheet
of ordinary plastic using a sketch pen filled with the HPUNC ink.
The characters were not observed by the naked eye in the normal daylight
but were clearly visible in PL mode (bright cyan color) under illumination
of a 365 nm UV lamp, as visualized in Figure 5a (top and bottom). Most importantly, this
ink was stable for several months in ambient conditions and applicable
on different surfaces such as paper and plastic. Moreover, the HPUNC
ink also exhibited reinforcing effect on the coated material. This
reinforcing effect was confirmed by evaluating the mechanical property
of the commercial filter paper coated with the HPUNC ink. As evident
from the stress–strain profile in Figure 5b, the tensile strength of HPUNC-coated paper
manifolded by 2.14 times, while the elongation at break drastically
improved by 3.82 times, signifying excellent reinforcing ability of
the HPUNC ink. This improved physico-mechanical property of the nanocomposite
ensured stability of the nanocomposite and protection of the coated
material and its content toward any external forces or any kind of
wear or tear to some extent. Moreover, the bioderived nature of the
nanocomposite and its intricate design and processing endowed eco-friendliness
and exclusivity, respectively. These observations reiterated the potential
utility of HPUNC dispersion as a high-performance anticounterfeiting
ink that can be used for loading important information for secret
communications and security features.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a photoluminescent high-performance
HPU nanocomposite
with oxygeneous-graphitic carbon nitride nanodots can be developed
by simple in situ prepolymerization technique. The incorporation of
oxygeneous-graphitic carbon nitride nanodots in the polymer matrix
manifolded the mechanical and thermal properties of the nanocomposite.
The dispersed nanocomposite demonstrated promising potential as an
anticounterfeiting ink with additional benefit of reinforcing ability.
Such attractive features would be tedious to replicate and hence can
be useful for anticounterfeiting applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
Guanidine hydrochloride (Alfa
Aesar, USA), sodium citrate (SRL, India), PCL (number-average molecular
weight = 2000 g/mol, Sigma–Aldrich, USA), and isophorone diisocyanate
(IPDI, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were used as received. Xylene (Merck, India)
and THF (Merck, India) were vacuum-distilled and kept in 4A-type molecular
sieves before use. Monoglyceride of sunflower oil (MGE) and COMP were
prepared as reported elsewhere6 and vacuum-dried
at 50 °C prior to use. Other chemicals and solvents were of reagent
grade and used without further purification.

Preparation of Oxygeneous-Graphitic
Carbon Nitride Nanodots
(Oxy-gCNDs)
Oxy-gCNDs were prepared by microwave pyrolysis
of guanidine hydrochloride and sodium citrate with slight modification
of an earlier report.31 Briefly, guanidine
hydrochloride and sodium citrate in the mol ratio of 9:1 were homogenized
together in deionized water, and the pH of the mixture was adjusted
to 12 using 25% aqueous NH3. Subsequently, the reactants
were subjected to microwave irradiation for 8 min in a domestic microwave
oven, operating at the power output of 600 W. After cooling, the as-obtained
dark brown residue is dissolved in deionized water and filtered to
separate the coarse residue. The filtrate is further centrifuged to
separate any suspended particulates, and the light yellow supernatant
is collected to give highly water dispersible oxy-gCNDs (concentration
of 22 mg mL–1).

Fabrication of Bioderived
Aliphatic HPU/Oxy-gCND Nanocomposite
(HPUNC)
HPUNC nanocomposite was fabricated by an in situ
polymerization technique using oxy-gCNDs as the nanoreinforcing agent.
In a typical prepolymerization process, PCL (0.0015 mol), IPDI (0.0025
mol), and MGE (0.001 mol) were reacted together at 130 ± 5 °C
for 3 h in xylene as the solvent under N2 atmosphere in
the first step. The highly viscous fluid obtained in the first step
was considered as a prepolymer. The prepolymer was cooled to room
temperature and subsequently was further reacted with COMP (0.0006
mol), IPDI (0.0010 mol), and a stable dispersion of oxy-gCNDs (in
DMF) at 130 ± 5 °C for 3 h in xylene as the solvent under
N2 atmosphere in the second step. The formation of the
nanocomposite was indicated by highly viscous mass obtained at the
completion of the reaction and confirmed by the absence of free isocyanate
band at 2260 cm–1 in the ATR–FTIR spectrum.

Different compositions of HPUNC were prepared by varying the loading
of a nanoreinforcing agent, oxy-gCNDs (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %), and
encoded as HPUNC0.5, HPUNC1.0, and HPUNC2.0. Similarly, pure HPU was
prepared following the same technique, without addition of oxy-gCNDs.
All of these compositions were collected and stored in glass vials
at ambient conditions.

Sample Preparation
For mechanical
analysis, all HPUNC
compositions were processed into thin films by solution casting upon
glass slides and metal plates, followed by complete drying for 24
h under ambient conditions. The dried films were peeled off from glass
slides and used for various testings. For anticounterfeiting applications,
dispersions of the HPUNC nanocomposite were prepared in xylene and
used directly as the ink material.

Characterization
ATR–FTIR spectra of the samples
were acquired from an IR spectrophotometer (model: Frontier MIR-FIR,
PerkinElmer, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples
were obtained using a small-angle XRD machine (model: D8 FOCUS, Bruker
AXS, Germany) operating with Cu Kα as the irradiation source.
The UV–visible spectra of the samples were recorded on a spectrophotometer
(model: Evolution 3000, ThermoScientific, USA). The PL spectra of
the nanodots were acquired by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model:
Fluorolog-3, Horiba, USA). The shape, size, and distribution of the
nanomaterial and nanocomposite over the polymer matrix were visually
investigated by using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope
(model: JEOL, JEMCXII, Japan). The thermal stability of the nanocomposites
was studied with the help of a thermogravimetric analyzer (model:
TGA 4000, PerkinElmer, USA) in the temperature range of 32–720
°C at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min under an atmosphere of
nitrogen gas. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength and elongation
at break were measured with a universal testing machine (model: WDW-10,
Jinan, China) with a 0.5 kN load cell and a crosshead speed of 0.05
m/min with sample dimensions of 5 cm × 1 cm × 0.04 cm. Scratch
hardness was evaluated by a scratch hardness tester (model: 705, Sheen
Instrument Ltd., UK) operating at a travel speed of 30 mm/min, and
impact resistance was calculated with an impact tester (S. C. Dey
& Co., India) by the falling weight method (using a weight of
0.84 kg), as per standard ASTM D 1037.
