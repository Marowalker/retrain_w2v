In the work, sulfur-containing
sorbents were employed to remove
elemental mercury (Hg0) from coal-fired flue gas. The work
used the thermogravimetric analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy,
X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to characterize
the physicochemical properties of the sorbents. The Hg0 removal performance of these used sorbents from the simulated coal-fired
flue gas was evaluated by a bench-scale fixed-bed reactor. The results
indicated that a generous amount of elemental sulfur covered the surface
and pore structure of the used sorbent. With the rise of H2S selective oxidation temperature, both the sulfur content and specific
surface area decreased rapidly. Used-Fe/SC120 could achieve the mercury removal
efficiency of above 90% at 90 °C. The high temperature was not
conducive to the mercury capture due to the release of surface elemental
sulfur. The presence of O2 and SO2 inhibited
Hg0 removal in different degrees because of the decreased
active sulfur sites and competitive adsorption. Meanwhile, NO promoted
the Hg0 removal efficiency by enhancing the Hg0 oxidation. The further
analysis showed that the surface elemental sulfur was vital to capture
the Hg0 from coal-fired flue gas, which reacted with Hg0 to form HgS.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Mercury is one of the
most considerably concerned pollutants in
the environment because of its persistence, toxicity, and bioaccumulation
in the ecosystem.1,2 The anthropogenic mercury sources
emitted to the atmosphere environment have been investigated, considering
the coal-fired power plant as the main anthropogenic mercury emission
source.3 Generally, there are the three
forms of mercury in coal-fired flue gas: particulate mercury (Hgp), oxidized mercury (Hg2+), and elemental mercury
(Hg0). The Hgp and Hg2+ can be easily
removed by existing convention air pollution control units, such as
wet flue gas desulfurization, fabric filters, or electrostatic precipitators.
However, the current air pollution control devices have little effect
on capture Hg0 due to its high volatility, low water solubility,
and low reactivity.

In recent decades, several technologies
have been developed to
remove Hg0 from flue gas. Among these technologies, activated
carbon injection has been regarded as a promising approach for Hg0 removal, which obtained more than 90% mercury removal efficiency.4,5 However, high maintenance, operation cost and low reproducibility
still hinder its industrial application in the developing countries.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop the cost-effective alternative
materials for elemental mercury removal from coal-fired flue gas.

Sulfur-impregnated carbons and sulfide minerals show a great potential
for elemental mercury adsorption.6−10 Korpiel et al.11 reported that the sulfur-impregnated
activated carbons exhibited the enhanced Hg0 removal efficiency
due to the easy and stable formation of mercuric sulfide on the carbon
surface. Compared with traditional active carbon and chars, the sulfur-impregnated
activated carbon was an effective sorbent. The reaction temperature
and oxygen content had great influence on mercury removal performance,
while SO2 and NO had no impact on adsorption processing.12

Li et al.13 reported that the Nano-ZnS
showed an excellent Hg0 adsorption capacity due to the
abundance of surface sulfur sites. The activated carbon sorbents modified
by metal sulfide were prepared, and their Hg0 adsorption
capacity increased several times than the activated carbon, with the
predominance of chemisorption.14 The mercury
removal performance always depended on the preparation parameters,
such as the method of sulfur impregnation, impregnation temperature,
and impregnation time. The distribution of elemental sulfur was considered
to be the key to develop an effective sorbent. However, the traditional
preparation method of the sulfur-impregnated sorbents was complicated
and time-consuming, resulting in the obvious increase of Hg removal
cost.

More recently, many researchers have committed to investigate
on
removing mercury from coal-fired flue gas using industrial wastes
or byproducts. Li et al.15 reported that
the pyrolyzed biochars from an industrial medicinal residue modified
by microwave activation and NH4Cl impregnation captured
the elemental mercury efficiently in flue gas. It was considered to
be a promising alternative to the commercial activated carbon sorbent
for capture of elemental mercury from coal-fired flue gas. Xiao et
al.16 found that petroleum coke, a waste
byproduct of petroleum refining, exhibited the excellent mercury removal
performance after being modified by chemical–mechanical bromination.
In addition, high sulfur and low cost made the petroleum coke a suitable
raw material for mercury capture from coal-fired flue gas. More and
more industrial wastes or byproducts, containing elemental sulfur
or sulfur compounds, have drawn a substantial amount of attention
and are used to remove the mercury from coal-fired flue gas.17,18

At present, land fill is the main processing method to dispose
the waste iron oxide desulfurizer. However, there are lots of problems
for the method, such as high treatment cost and serious waste of sulfur
resource. The work employed a series of used sulfur-containing sorbents
for capturing elemental mercury from coal-fired flue gas at low temperatures.
The physicochemical properties of samples were characterized by thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method,
scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Besides, the effects of temperature and atmosphere on Hg0 removal efficiency were investigated. The possible mechanism and
reaction processing for Hg0 removal were proposed based
on the experimental results and characterization analysis.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Sample Preparation
The Fe/SC catalysts
were prepared by the hydrothermal impregnation method. The Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was used as a Fe2O3 precursor with semicoke as a supporting material. Table 1 shows the proximate
analysis and ultimate analysis of semicoke. The 40–60 mesh
SC and the 7wt % Fe(NO3)3 solution were placed
in an autoclave with hydrothermal impregnation at 200 °C for
5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the samples were filtered
and dried at 110 °C for 12 h. Finally, the samples were calcined
at 500 °C for 4 h.

The H2S selective catalytic oxidation experiments
were
evaluated on a fixed-bed reactor in a set period at different reaction
temperatures (120, 150, 180, and 210 °C). The concentration of
H2S was 2000 ppm with 0.5 L/min gas flow rate, and the
ratio of H2S to O2 in volume content was 2:1.
Then, the sorbents were obtained to capture the elemental mercury
from simulated coal-fired flue gas. The fresh and used sorbents were
denoted fresh-Fe/SC, used-Fe/SC120, used-Fe/SC150, used-Fe/SC180,
and used-Fe/SC210.

2.2 Sample Characterization
The total
sulfur content in samples was tested by 5E-IRS3600 (CKIC, China).
The phase structure of samples was determined by an X-ray diffractometer
(Bruker, Germany) using Cu kα radiation in the range of 10–80°
(2θ) with a step size of 0.02°. The specific surface area,
pore volume, and average pore size were measured by the physical adsorption/desorption
of N2 at 77 K by employing an automatic surface analyzer
(ASAP2460). The surface morphology and microstructure of the sorbents
were obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS,
Germany), and the surface elemental components was tested by energy-disperse
spectroscopy (EDS). The thermogravimetric (TG) analysis of samples
was recorded on a TGA/DSC 1 instrument (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland).
For each test, the sample was heated from 30 to 600 °C at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min under an Ar atmosphere (99.999%). The surface
atomic states of the sorbents were analyzed by a Kα X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Kratos, U.K.) with an Al Kα X-ray source at room
temperature. The binding energies were calibrated by setting the C
1s peak at 284.8eV.

2.3 Hg0 Adsorption
and Desorption Experiments
The Hg0 removal tests
were carried out on a fixed-bed
reactor device under atmospheric pressure. Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental
system. The test system contained five parts: a simulated flue gas
system, a Hg0 vapor generator, a fixed-bed reactor, a temperature-controlled
tubular furnace, and a continuous online Hg0 analyzer (Thermo
Scientific CEMS). The fixed-bed reactor (inner diameter of 20 mm,
length of 50 mm, Quartz glass) was loaded with 500 mg of sorbent samples
and placed vertically in a tubular furnace. All of the pipe connecting
joints and containers were made of Teflon and covered with heating
tapes, so Hg0 could not be adsorbed on the solid surfaces
at a constant temperature of 100 °C. The total flow rate of simulated
flue gas was 1.0 L/min, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity
of 15 000 h–1. The initial gaseous Hg0 concentration in the flue gas was about 60.0 μg/m3, which was provided by a Dynacal Hg0 permeation
device (VICI Metronics). To guarantee the constant permeating concentration,
the Hg0 permeation was placed in a U-shape glass tube,
immersed in a 45 °C water bath.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the experimental
system.

A series of tests were designed
to explore the suitable used sorbent
and the impact of different operational parameters on Hg0 removal. The designed experimental conditions are summarized in Table 2. The running time
of each experiment was 90 min. The adsorption test was repeated 3
times with their average values reported. The Hg0 concentration
in the inlet and outlet of the reactor were monitored by CEMS 80i,
denoted Hgin0 and Hgout0, respectively. The exhaust gas from the mercury analyzer was immediately
introduced into the activated carbon trap before discharging into
the atmosphere. The Hg0 removal efficiency, Et, was defined as 1  Here, Hgin0 and Hgout0 are the concentrations in the inlet
and outlet
of the reactor, respectively.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterizations of Samples
TG technology
was employed to identify the sulfur forms in the used Fe/SC sorbents. Figure 2a,b shows the TG
curves for fresh and used sorbents and for the reaction product sulfur,
respectively. The initial mass loss below 150 °C was generally
ascribed to the loss of physically and chemically adsorbed water.
With the increase of temperature, the weight loss of samples was obviously
observed at 200–310 °C. The variation curves of used Fe/SC
in Figure 2a were significantly
different from those of the fresh one because of elemental sulfur
and sulfides in them. The weight loss of used samples was coincident
with the mass loss change of the reaction product sulfur exhibited
in Figure 2b. The results
showed that the weight loss of used Fe/SC should be mainly attributed
to the release of elemental sulfur.

Figure 2 TG curves of (a) the fresh and used Fe/SC
and (b) catalytic product
sulfur.

The total sulfur contents of the
samples fresh-Fe/SC, used-Fe/SC120,
used-Fe/SC150, used-Fe/SC180, and used-Fe/SC210 were 0.270, 6.289,
5.715, 5.526, and 5.425%, respectively, which are summarized in Table 3. The contents of
sulfur in the used samples were slightly reduced with the increase
of reaction temperature. When the reaction temperature was low (e.g.,
less than 120 °C), a generous amount of reaction product elemental
sulfur was left in the samples. As the reaction temperature increased,
it was more conducive to the reaction of H2S with Fe2O3 to form FeS, resulting in decrease of sulfur
selectivity. Simultaneously, sulfur product released into the gas
in the form of gaseous sulfur more easily.

The
BET surface areas, pore volumes, and average pore diameters
of different samples are presented in Table 3. The specific surface area of fresh-Fe/SC
was 321.281 m2/g. The specific surface areas of used-Fe/SC120,
used-Fe/SC150, used-Fe/SC180, and used-Fe/SC210 decreased to 153.645,
101.217, 47.096, and 32.339 m2/g, respectively.

Figure 3 illustrates
that micropores dominated in the fresh-Fe/SC derived from lignite
semicoke and the pore sizes were mainly distributed in the regime
of 0.4 ≤ d ≤ 1.5 nm. With the increase
of catalytic oxidation temperature of H2S, the specific
surface area of used sorbent decreased rapidly. In addition, the content
of micro-mesoporous structure and the N2 adsorption capacity
in the used sorbents decreased obviously. The reasons accounting for
this phenomenon might be due to the elemental sulfur deposition, channel
plugging, and the growth of FeS particle size after the reaction.

isotherms of sorbents (a, used-Fe/SC120; b, used-Fe/SC150; c, used-Fe/SC180;
d, used-Fe/SC210; e, fresh-Fe/SC).

To reveal the surface structures of used sorbents at different
reaction temperatures, the texture and morphology of used-Fe/SC120
and used-Fe/SC210 were investigated by SEM, which are illustrated
in Figure 4a,b. Figure 4 shows that the surface
morphology of used-Fe/SC120 was different from that of used-Fe/SC210.
The pore structures of the used-Fe/SC120 did not block the pores and
channels as serious as that of used-Fe/SC210, on the surface of which
the FeS particle agglomeration occurred. Therefore, the specific surface
area of used-Fe/SC120 was much larger than that of used-Fe/SC210.

(a) used-Fe/SC120, (b) used-Fe/SC210, and detailed sections
of used-Fe/SC120 (c, d) and (e) SEM-EDS of used-Fe/SC120.

Figure 4c,d
shows
that the surface of used-Fe/SC120 was covered with the generated sulfur,
which appeared irregular with a needlelike morphology. The sulfur
was attached to the sorbent surface, which provided more S active
sites to facilitate Hg0 absorption. However, the elemental
sulfur was just attached to the surface of the sorbent with poor interface
combination ability. Nevertheless, the EDS analysis in Figure 4e showed that the S content
of used-Fe/SC120 was consistent with that in Table 3.

The XRD technique was employed to
explore the types of fresh and
used Fe/SC sorbents, and the XRD spectra are shown in Figure 5. The diffraction peaks of
Fe2O3 were found at 24.2, 33.2, 35.7, 40.9,
49.5, 54.1, 62.5, and 64.0° for the fresh and used Fe/SC sorbents,
which were recognized by matching JCPDS 87-1165. Compared with that
of fresh sorbent, the diffraction peak intensity of Fe2O3 on the used sorbents decreased obviously after the
H2S selective catalytic oxidation reaction, indicating
that partial Fe2O3 had participated in the reaction
to form FeS. Besides, the EDS analysis in Figure 4e indicated that partial Fe existed in the
form of FeS. However, the diffraction peaks corresponding to FeS and
elemental sulfur did not stand out. This result was attributed to
the fact that FeS and elemental sulfur were in an amorphous or poorly
crystalline state.

3.2 Hg0 Adsorption Performance
3.2.1 Comparisons of Hg0 Removal Performance
of Fresh and Used Fe/SC
Figure 6 shows the Hg0 removal efficiency
of different used sorbents at 120 °C. It could be observed that
the Hg0 removal performance of sorbents decreased in different
degrees. The Hg0 removal performances of fresh-Fe/SC, used-Fe/SC180
and used-Fe/SC210 were similar. The instantaneous Hg0 removal
efficiency was about 80%, and then decreased gradually to about 63.3%.
The removal performance of used-Fe/SC120 was slightly higher than
that of used-Fe/SC150 and significantly much higher than that of the
other three. The mercury removal efficiency of used-Fe/SC120 decreased
slowly from 93.2 to 79.6% within 90 min. This might be attributed
to the fact that used-Fe/SC120 had quite rich pore structure and more
S active sites on the surface of the sorbent. Due to the higher specific
surface and the developed pore structure, the fresh-Fe/SC exhibited
good mercury removal performance. The Hg0 removal over
used-Fe/SC occurred through chemical adsorption, while the Hg0 removal over fresh-Fe/SC occurred through physical adsorption.
Thus, it could be concluded the higher surface area and more S active
sites were both essential for a better Hg0 removal performance.

efficiency of different sorbents. Reaction condition: 4%
O2, 10% CO2, N2 balance, 120 °C,
and 60 μg/m3 Hg0 concentration.

3.2.2 Effect of Adsorption
Temperature
Used-Fe/SC120 was chosen to investigate the impact
of the reaction
temperature on mercury removal performance. Figure 7a displays the Hg0 removal efficiency
of used-Fe/SC120 at the temperature range from 60 to 150 °C. Figure 7a shows that temperature
had great influence on the Hg0 removal efficiency and that
Hg0 adsorption significantly weakened with the increase
of temperature. The mercury removal efficiency was stable within 90
min at 60 and 90 °C, with the average efficiencies of 92.4 and
89.5%, respectively. However, the Hg0 adsorption performance
of used-Fe/SC120 decreased with the temperature increasing to 120
°C. At 150 °C, the Hg0 adsorption efficiency
dropped sharply from the initial 88.5 to 44.4% within 90 min. It might
be attributed to the fact that a lower temperature was more suitable
for the reaction between S active sites and Hg0. Nevertheless,
the decrease of Hg0 removal efficiency at 150 °C was
due to the desorption of Hg0 adsorbed on the surface of
sorbent.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of reaction temperature on Hg0 removal performance
and (b) sulfur content of the sorbent (proportion of total sulfur
after and before reaction). Reaction condition: 4% O2,
10% CO2, N2 balance, 60 μg/m3 Hg0 concentration, and used-Fe/SC120.

The inhibition of Hg0 adsorption at 150 °C
might
be interpreted by another possible reason: The release of elemental
sulfur from the sorbent decreased the surface sulfur coverage. The
effect of adsorption temperature on surface sulfur content was displayed
in Figure 7b. Some
surface sulfur released from sorbents after experiment at 60 and 90
°C. The release of surface sulfur occurred and become more serious
with the adsorption temperature increasing to 150 °C. The reason
was that the high temperature promoted the reaction of S and O2. As a result, the decrease of surface sulfur content reduced
the S active sites.

3.2.3 Effect of Flue Gas Components
Figure 8 shows that
in the
absence of O2 the Hg0 removal average efficiency
was about 91.27%, while the average efficiency decreased to about
86.9% with 4% O2 being introduced into the reaction system.
With the O2 concentration increasing to 8%, the average
efficiency decreased to about 82.8%. This suggested that O2 had a slight adverse effect on Hg0 adsorption over used-Fe/SC120
at 90 °C. A small amount of unstable surface sulfur reacted with
O2 to form SO2, resulting in the decrease of
the amount of active sites. SO2 played an inhibitive role
in Hg0 adsorption as well. The Hg0 removal average
efficiency decreased from 86.9 to 83.1 and 80.8% with the addition
of 500 and 1000 ppm SO2 into a 4%O2 + N2 + 10%CO2 atmosphere, respectively. This could
be attributed to the competitive adsorption between SO2 and Hg0 on the surface of sorbents. When 300 ppm NO was
added into the 4%O2 + N2 + 10%CO2 atmosphere, the average efficiency decreased slightly from 86.9
to 85.9%. Then, it increased NO concentration to 600 ppm, with the
Hg0 removal efficiency improved slightly. The results suggested
that there was a possible reaction route between NO2 and
Hg0 to produce HgO and NO.

Figure 8 Effect of flue gas components on Hg0 removal performance.
Reaction condition: 90 °C, 60 μg/m3 Hg0 concentration, and used-Fe/SC120.

The stability experiment of the used-Fe/SC120 sorbent for Hg0 removal was carried out, and Figure 9 shows the results. The Hg0 removal
efficiency decreased from 93.3 to 79.5% within 360 min, implying that
the used-Fe/SC120 sorbent was an effective sorbent for Hg0 capture.

4% O2, 10% CO2, N2 balance, 90 °C,
100 μg/m3 Hg0 concentration, and used-Fe/SC120.

3.2.4 Mechanism of Hg0 Removal
XPS analysis was employed to explore the chemical
state and the relative
portion of Fe, S, and Hg on the surface of sorbents before and after
Hg0 removal, and the results are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 XPS spectra of used-Fe/SC120
before and after Hg0 removal
test for (a) Fe 2p, (b) S 2p, and (c) Hg 4f.

It can be seen from Figure 10a that the Fe 2p spectra for fresh and used sorbents
showed three peaks at 710.5, 711.7, and 713.0 eV, corresponding to
Fe2+ species bonded with S22–, Fe3+species bonded with O2–, and Fe3+ species bonded with SO42–,
respectively.19−21 The Fe 2p peaks for the surface of the fresh and
used sorbents were basically the same, suggesting that Fe had not
participated in the Hg0 adsorption process.

The S
2p spectra of the fresh and used sorbents are shown in Figure 10b. The peaks at
164.0, 164.9, and 168.9 eV were assigned to polysulfur and S species
in S2– and SO42–, respectively.22,23 The sulfate was not supposed to participate in the process of mercury
removal, taking the peak area of sulfate at 168.9 eV as a reference
point. The peak area of polysulfur in the sorbent decreased significantly,
with the ratio of polysulfur/sulfate decreased from 1.696 to 0.611.
This might be ascribed to the fact that surface sulfur reacted with
Hg0 to form HgS.

Figure 10c shows
the XPS spectrum of Hg 4f for used-Fe/SC120 after Hg0 removal
tests. The peak at 100.9 eV was ascribed to HgS,24,25 which formed from the reaction of elemental mercury and sulfur.
This further confirmed that chemical adsorption occurred on the surface
S active sites of the sorbent.

The method of temperature-programmed
decomposition (TPD) was widely
used to identify the occurrence modes of Hg in coals.26−28 Hg-TPD was used to identify the mercury species in the used sorbent,
and Figure 11 shows
the desorption profiles of Hg. There was a well-resolved peak at about
200 °C, which could be ascribed to the release of β-HgS.29,30

Figure 11 Hg-TPD pattern of the used-Fe/SC120 after the Hg0 removal
experiment.

Therefore, the possible mechanism
for Hg0 removal over
the used-Fe/SC120 at low temperatures may be described as 2   3   4  

4 Conclusions
The
elemental mercury adsorption experiments were operated over
the used-Fe/SC120 sorbent at low temperatures by a waste sulfur-containing
catalyst. The results showed that the used-Fe/SC120 sorbent achieved the
elemental mercury average removal efficiency of about 90% in a N2 + 4%O2 + 10% CO2 atmosphere at 90 °C.
The high temperature inhibited the Hg0 removal performance
due to the release of surface elemental sulfur. The presence of O2 obviously was not conducive to Hg0 removal. SO2 played an inhibitive role in Hg0 removal due to
the competitive absorption of pore structure, while NO had almost
no influence on the removal efficiency.

Based on the results
of tests and characterization analysis of
fresh and used sorbents, the surface elemental sulfur was critical
to elemental mercury removal. Elemental sulfur had the advantage of
the formation of stable β-HgS on the sorbent surface. The used-Fe/SC
sorbent was a cost-effective material for removing elemental mercury
from coal-fired flue gas at a low temperature.
