Aimed
at further exploring the hosting properties of cucurbit[7]uril
(CB7), we have exploited the spectroscopic and photophysical properties
of a known fluorescent label as the guest molecule, namely, 3-cyano-6-(2-thienyl)-4-trifluoromethyl
pyridine (TFP), in neat solvents. The formation of an inclusion host–guest
complex with CB7 was checked by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
and the value of binding constant (9.7 × 105 M–1) was extracted from the spectrophotometric data.
The modulation of keto–enol equilibrium in TFP by the local
environment is governed by the interplay between dimerization through
intermolecular hydrogen bonding between individual solute molecules,
favoring the enol form, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
TFP and the surrounding solvents, favoring the keto form. Time-resolved
fluorescence results established that the macromolecular CB7 host
stabilizes preferentially the neutral enol form over the keto form
of TFP. Unprecedentedly, our results reveal a linear dependence of
the amplitudes of the extracted decay-associated spectra from the
time-resolved fluorescence spectra of TFP on the sum of polarity/polarizability
and hydrogen bonding parameters of the local environment, confirming
that TFP at micromolar concentration in the CB7 complexes is experiencing
a methanol-like environment. The results rationalized the 42-fold
enhancement in the solubility of TFP in water media by complexation
in CB7.

1 Introduction
The
modulation of emission properties, including emission maxima
and lifetimes, of the guest molecules utilizing host–guest
chemistry has become a popular approach in the literature, with applications
in biomedicine, chemical sensing, and energy conversion,1−4 being a straightforward and inexpensive approach that bypasses the
synthetic burdens associated with covalent modifications of potential
guest molecules. For example, sequestration of several fluorophores’
“isolation” into macromolecules, such as cucurbiturils
(CBs)1,2 and cyclodextrins (CDs),3,4 was
exploited to prevent fluorescence quenching by dimer dissociation
and protection against molecular aggregation.5,6 This
has also led to alleviation of the solubility of potential guests
in water at neutral pH and enhancement in their thermal and photochemical
stability.7,8

The present study was specifically
conducted to explore the effects
of hydrogen bonding of excited states in CB host–guest inclusion
complex molecules on the fluorescence of the guest molecules by analogy
to those interactions in CD complexes.9 Fluorescence enhancement in several CB host–guest complexes
has already been rationalized through the effects of host-induced
polarity and rigidity (confinement) effects, assuming mostly electrostatic
and hydrophobic non-covalent intermolecular interactions,10−16 yet rarely hydrogen bonding effects were mentioned.17,18 Our research group, among others,10−21 has exploited non-covalent supramolecular interactions to enhance
the emission of several guests inside the CDs and CBs in water, such
as derivatives of coumarin drugs through hydrogen bonding interactions,19 benzimidazole drugs through ion–dipole
interactions,20 and luciferin bioluminescent
fluorophores through dipole–quadrupole interactions.21 We have also, among others, published other
examples on fluorescence enhancement upon which the CB has suppressed
photoinduced electron transfer22 or twisted-intramolecular
charge transfer in some dyes.11,13,23

In the present work, 3-cyano-6-(2-thienyl)-4-trifluoromethyl
pyridine
(TFP)24 was specifically selected as a
model dye that displays keto–enol equilibrium, with the aim
of further exploring the hosting potential of cucurbit[7]uril (CB7)
macrocycles (Figure 1) for enhancing the emission of the selected tag and consequently
its water solubility. Supramolecular shifting of keto–enol
equilibrium by CBs toward the keto forms was reported to be governed
by either polarity21,25 or polarizability effects.26 However, the role of CB hydrogen bonding interactions
in modulating keto–enol equilibria in the excited states has
never been addressed to the best of our knowledge. Not only CB7 shifts
the keto–enol equilibrium in TFP toward the enol forms, but
also it enhances both its emission and water solubility. Thus, our
findings in the present work offer TFP as a probe to unfold more information
on the structure and dynamics of different biological media, such
as luciferase.21 Moreover, the TFP fluorophore
itself has been employed to stain the mitochondria surface,27 to inhibit metallo-β-lactamase thus restoring
the function of carbapenem antibiotics in the treatment of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria,28 and to inhibit hepatitis C
virus.29 The very low water solubility
of TFP has limited its use because of formation of dots in the microscope.27

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Interaction of TFP with
CB7 and pKa Determination in Water
The inclusion of TFP
by CB7 is evidenced by absorption and emission spectroscopic measurements
in pure water. The acid-dissociation constant (pKa) value for TFP was extracted from the evolution of the
UV–vis absorption spectra of TFP as a function of pH (Figure 2; Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). The value
has shifted by 1.3 units in the presence of CB7 (pKa = 5.82 vs 7.11), because of the preferential binding
of CB7 toward the neutral species over the anion forms.

by monitoring the UV–vis absorption bands of
TFP (λmon = 420 nm, in water) in the absence (filled
circles, 40 μM) and presence of 1 mM CB7 (empty circles, 22
μM).

The formation of an inclusion
host–guest complex with CB7
at pH 3 was checked by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, and
the value of binding constant (9.7 × 105 M–1) was extracted from the spectrophotometric data (Figure 3). Contrarily, a very weak
binding was observed between CB7 and TFP at pH 11 (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), confirming the preferential
binding of CB7 toward the neutral species over the anion forms. Upon
the addition of CB7 to neutral TFP, the absorption band around 400
nm was broadened and red-shifted (from 399 to 402 nm), while the emission
intensity increased by 1.5-fold with no peak shift at about 465 nm
(excitation at 395 nm). TFP has partially entered the cavity of CB7
from its thiophene ring in a 1:1 ratio as confirmed by the NMR titration
of TFP by CB7 in 50% DMSO in water at pH 3 (Figure 4). All NMR peaks were shifted to lower ppm,
except H-a proton, which remained unchanged.

TFP with CB7 at pH 3: Panel (A) shows the
evolution of the UV–vis absorption spectra of TFP (22 μmol/L)
with the addition of CB7. The inset shows the nonlinear fitting according
to a 1:1 binding model (solid line, see the Experimental Section). Panel (B) shows the effects of binding to CB7 (0–300
μmol/L) on the emission spectra of TFP (22 μmol/L) at
the same pH, λexc = 395 nm. OD = optical density

2.2 Spectrophysics of TFP in Neat Solvents and
CB7
Table 1 summarizes the collected major absorption and emission maxima for
keto and enol structures (see Figure 5 and Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), along with the corresponding Stokes shifts in
different neat solvents and inside the CB7 cavity. While the keto
species absorbs and emits around 400 and 450 nm, the enol form has
its absorption and emission bands centered about 365 and 400 nm. The
results confirmed that a non-hydrogen bonding solvent, such as chloroform,
stabilizes the enol form, whereas DMSO stabilizes the keto form. The 1H-NMR spectra were also measured for TFP at different concentrations
in DMSO-d6 (Figure S6). Assignments of the major peaks are fully explained in
the Experimental Section. It transpires that
TFP exists mainly in its keto form in this solvent, regardless of
the concentration. Contrarily, the concentration-dependent NMR measurements
in CDCl3 (Figure S7) confirm
that TFP’s structure has shifted mostly from enol to keto form
upon lowering the concentration. Specifically, the singlet-broad peak,
which belongs to proton H-a, appears to be most sensitive to the structure
of the individual form. In CDCl3 at high concentration,
the NMR resonance of this proton appears at 6.9 ppm. However, the
peak shifts to higher ppm, when the concentration of TFP was lowered
in CDCl3. The new position at 7.6 ppm was also observed
in the NMR spectrum of TFP in DMSO-d6,
confirming the partial conversion of enol to keto form when the concentration
of TFP is lowered in CDCl3 because of dissociation of the
enol dimer. Noticeably, neither the absorption/emission peak positions
nor their intensities were sensitive to solvent properties, such as
polarity, polarity/polarizability, and rigidity, which are manifested
by several solvent parameters in Table 2, such as orientational polarizability (Δf), Kamlet and Taft (π*), and viscosity (η)
parameters. The measured absorption and emission spectra were also
not correlated with the hydrogen bonding donating (α) or accepting
abilities (β) of the solvents. This means that any of these
solvent parameters—polarity, polarizability, confinement, or
hydrogen binding effects—does not alone play a role in affecting
the photophysical properties of TFP.

We turned to time-resolved emission studies
being more useful for
better understanding the origin of luminescence and assessing which
solvent property controls the keto–enol equilibrium in TFP
in the excited states at micromolar concentration. In the present
study, the emission decays were measured every 10 nm across the entire
emission spectra for each sample when excited at 375 nm. In the global
analysis, the data measured at all wavelengths are fitted simultaneously
by the sum of exponential decays convoluted with the instrument response
function (IRF). The lifetimes are assumed to be the same across the
whole data set, while the pre-exponential factors are left free. The
estimated pre-exponential factors/amplitudes represent the estimated
spectra, with a lifetime given by the inverse of the rate constant
of the exponential decay. The global analysis of the present data
was performed utilizing Edinburgh FAST software, which uses a model
of a number of parallel decaying components, assuming no kinetic growth.
In this case, the estimated amplitudes at each wavelength are termed
decay-associated spectra (DAS), representing the true spectra for
each species originating from a different ground state. Specifically,
DAS (Figure 6 and Figure S5 in the Supporting Information) were
constructed from the extracted intensity-contribution fraction (fi) calculated from the pre-exponential amplitudes
(Bi) (see the Experimental Section). All emission traces were globally fitted to a triexponential
model function after being convoluted with an IRF of ∼30 ps.
The measurements were carried out under nitrogen purging. The fluorescence
lifetime experiments were repeated several times. The estimated experimental
error was 4%.

TFP (25
μM) in C2H5OC2H5 (A) and water (pH 3) (B) upon excitation at 375 nm and room temperature.
The corresponding steady-state spectra of each solution are also shown
for comparison (see the Experimental Section).

Excited-state lifetimes alongside
amplitudes and maxima of the
extracted DAS are listed in Table 3. All observed DAS amplitudes were positive, confirming
no sign of evolution in the excited state. The enol species emits
at about 400 nm (DAS peak), whose excited-state lifetime is about
1–3 ns, whereas the keto form shows long and short-lived components
with lifetimes of about 1–3 (DAS peak at 440 nm) and 0.1–0.5
ns (DAS maximum around 470 nm), respectively, both originating from
a separate ground state. Further experiments are needed to explore
the origin of the two transient keto species, yet the average lifetime
was calculated in Table 4 (see the Experimental Section). To get an
insight into the effect of solvent on the photophysical properties
of TFP, the radiative (kr) and nonradiative
(knr) rate constants (Table 4) were compared to the solvent
parameters listed in Table 2, yet no correlation was observed. However, DAS amplitudes,
not maxima, were strongly solvent-dependent (Table 3), in which the population of the keto forms
was calculated from the DAS amplitudes. Figure 7 gives a linear plot of the reading signal
represented by the DAS amplitudes and local environment effects represented
by the sum of three solvent parameters—α, β, and
π*. It can be said that non-hydrogen bonding solvents favor
the enol form, because of their inability to dissociate its dimer,
while those solvents with hydrogen bonding accepting or donating abilities
can then shift the equilibrium toward the keto form. The measured
NMR spectra for TFP in different organic solvents, such as methanol,
DMSO, benzene, chloroform, and toluene (Figure 8 and Figure S8), support the results in Figure 7 at millimolar concentration, in which a linear correlation
was also obtained between the relative NMR resonance for proton H-a
and the combination of the three solvent parameters α + β
+ π*. In calculating the keto percentage, two values were assumed
for the NMR resonance of proton H-a, which are 8 and 6 for the 100%
keto and 100% enol form, respectively. This result is also not surprising
and agrees with previous findings on similar keto–enol systems.30 However, to correct the effects of concentration
on the keto/enol ratio, we have used the data in Figure S7 to create Table S1 in the Supporting Information, in which the relative integral values for H-a
protons at peak positions 7.6 and 6.9 ppm were used to estimate the
keto/enol ratio at different TFP concentrations in CDCl3. The ratio at 0.05 mM in Table S1 in the Supporting Information matches the ratio from the DAS experiment in Table 3 at 0.025 mM (41 versus
31%). The slope of the plot of this keto percentage as a function
of TFP concentrations (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information) was used to extrapolate the calculated keto/enol
ratio in Figure S8 for the 0.05 mM concentration.
The data in Figure S8 were corrected and
replotted in the same graph for comparison. It transpires that the
keto/enol ratios from the NMR analysis at micromolar concentrations
match the ratios obtained from DAS experiments in Figure 7 and Table 3 within 14% error (for example, 56 versus
41% at 0.05mM in CDCl3), which is plausible considering
that the two different approaches for calculating keto/enol ratios
from NMR data would have different accuracies.

b Average lifetime for keto species
was calculated at 455 nm (see the Experimental Section).

c ND = not determined.

Despite the high binding affinity
between TFP and CB7, only 1.5-fold
fluorescence enhancement was observed upon complexation to CB7. This
can be explained by the NMR titration results in Figure 4 that the fluorescent tag in
the complex is partially exposed to water.

From the correlation
in Figure 7, it appears
that the sum of polarity/polarizability
and hydrogen bonding interactions experienced by the probe in CB7
is equivalent to that in methanol. In the present study, this conclusion
was implemented on enhancing solubility of TFP in water (Figure 9). Notice the fluorescence
enhancement is attributed to the confinement effects by complexation
in CB7, which has reduced the nonradiative rate constant in the free
fluorophore more significantly than the radiative rate constants (compare
values in CB7 to that in water in Table 4). This conclusion is supported by observing
no shift in the emission peak position at 465 nm upon complexation
(Figure 3B).

spectra measured at pH 3 for the free TFP drugs in the
absence (red lines) and presence of CB7 (3.7 mmol/L, orange lines).
The solubility enhancement factors are indicated along the arrows.
Note that the UV absorption spectrum of TFP in the presence of CB7
was obtained for a solution diluted seven times to obtain an OD value
inside the instrumental range.

2.3 Implication for Solubilization of TFP in Water
by CB7 and Other Applications
The effect that the addition
of CB7 has on the solubility of the guests was determined by UV spectrophotometry
(see Figure 9) at pH
3. In the presence of 3.7 mmol/L CB7, the solubility of TFP increased
by a factor of 42. In terms of absolute solubilities (these were determined
from the OD values), they increased upon complexation from 0.18 to
0.65 mmol/L. It is plausible to assume the enhancement is governed
by the methanol-equivalent solvent effects (see above). The use of
macrocycles for solubilization in aqueous solutions is consequently
particularly promising for TFP fluorescent tags.

The results
in the present work can be extrapolated so that the TFP probe can
be used to decipher the microenvironment effects of other biological
receptors that can be considered a mimic of the microenvironment,
size, and shape of CB7. Certainly, the position of the functional
groups and their location in the complex with respect to the receptor
may put some limitation on the potential benefits of TFP as a fluorescent
probe. From another perspective, one could expect that different probes
report contrasting properties for the CB7 receptor, that is, while
TFP “is experiencing a methanol-like environment” in
CB7, other probes could experience other solvent-like environments,
and the extrapolation of the results here for other probes must be
treated with caution.

3 Conclusions
It is
concluded that time-resolved emission measurements evaluated
by a global analysis method while assuming an appropriate kinetic
model are more useful in understanding the local environment effects
(represented here by CB7) on the water solubility and emission properties
of some fluorescent tags (such as TFP) that belong to the pyridone
family. Inclusion of TFP in the CB7 cavity has led to a 1.5-fold enhancement
in its fluorescence quantum yield and an increase by 45-fold in its
water solubility. The observations were rationalized on the basis
of the spectrophysical behaviors of TFP in neat solvents. The emission
signals of TFP were found to be well correlated with the sum of solvent
hydrogen bonding abilities and polarity/polarizability parameters,
establishing that CB7 has solvent properties equivalent to those in
the methanol solvent. This methanol-like microenvironment enables
CB7 to stabilize preferentially the enol form over the keto form at
the ground state regardless of the concentration of TFP whether in
micromolar (DAS results) or millimolar (NMR results).

purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. However, the host
was assumed to contain 20% water in the calculation of concentrations
as notified by the supplier. Millipore water was used (conductivity
less than 0.05 μS).

4.2 Synthesis of TFP
A mixture of 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(thiophen-2-yl)butane-1,3-dione
(10 mmol, 2.22 g), 2-cyanoacetamide (11.0 mmol, 0.92 g), and potassium
hydroxide (12.0 mmol, 0.67 g) in ethanol (50 mL) was heated under
reflux for 6 h. The mixture was cooled, and the resultant mixture
was acidified with 0.1 M HCl. The precipitate formed was crystallized
from an appropriate solvent and dried to give the desired 2-pyridone.

4.3 Spectroscopy33,34
The
UV–vis spectra were measured using a Cary-300 instrument (Varian).
Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Cary-Eclipse instrument
with slit widths of 2.5 and 5 nm for the excitation and emission monochromator
in all experiments. In the titration experiment, the total concentrations
of the guest were kept constant and that of the host was gradually
increased. The optical spectra were plotted as a function of the host’s
total concentrations at a given wavelength. The intermolecular interaction
between CB7 and TFP may be quantified by the affinity constant referred
to as the association equilibrium (K)   1   2   3  where CTFP and CCB7 mean the total concentrations
of TFP and CB7, respectively. It can be written as: 4  Using eqs
11–4, we
obtain 5  where ΔY is the optical changes at a given
λ, Δ(constant) is
the difference between the molar absorptivity of free and CB7-complexed
TFP, and K is the binding constant. The binding constants
(K) were then evaluated by using the nonlinear formula
of eq 5. Constant 2 was
left as a floating parameter in the analysis by the Levenberg–Marquardt
algorithm, which was provided by SigmaPlot software (version 6.1;
SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All NMR spectra were performed on a
Varian 400 MHz spectrometer in D2O. All 1H-NMR
spectra are referenced in ppm with respect to a TMS standard. The
pH values of the solutions were adjusted (±0.2 units) by adding
adequate amounts of HCl or NaOH and recorded using a pH meter (WTW
330i equipped with a WTW SenTix Mic glass electrode).

4.4 Photochemistry35
The fluorescence
lifetimes were measured by time-correlated
single-photon counting on a LifeSpec II spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments)
by using an EPL-375 picosecond diode laser (λex =
375 nm, repetition rate = 20 MHz, and instrument function = 30 ps)
for excitation. The time-resolved emission (intensity of ∼1000–3000
counts/s) was collected (with a constant dwell time of 10 s) every
10 nm across the entire emission spectrum by a red-sensitive high-speed
PMT (Hamamatsu, H5773-04) detector. The data were analyzed by the
iterative reconvolution method using the instrument’s software
that utilizes the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize
χ2. The fluorescence decay was analyzed in terms
of the multiexponential model 6  where τi are the lifetimes with
amplitudes αi and ∑αi = 1.0. The contribution of each component to
the steady-state intensity
is given by 7  where all the decay times
and amplitudes are over the their sum in the denominator. The mean
decay time (average lifetime) is given by 8
