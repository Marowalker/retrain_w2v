A rhodamine-based
smart probe (RHES) has been developed
for trace-level detection and discrimination of multiple cations,
viz. Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in a ratiometric manner involving photo-induced electron
transfer–chelation-enhanced fluorescence–fluorescence
resonance energy transfer processes. The method being very fast and
highly selective allows their bare eye visualization at a physiological
pH. The optimized geometry and spectral properties of RHES and its cation adducts have been analyzed by time-dependent density
functional theory calculations. RHES detects as low as
1.5 × 10–9 M Al3+, 1.2 × 10–9 M Zn2+, 6.7 × 10–9 M Cd2+, and 1.7 × 10–10 M Hg2+, whereas the respective association constants are 1.33 ×
105 M–1, 2.11 × 104 M–1, 1.35 × 105 M–1, and 4.09 × 105 M–1. The other
common ions do not interfere. The probe is useful for intracellular
imaging of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in
squamous epithelial cells. RHES is useful for the determination
of the ions in sea fish and real samples.

Introduction
A
smart probe that converts a highly selective molecular recognition
of multiple ions into easily detectable signals is very attractive
in the present scenario. The techniques to visualize bioactive and
environment-relevant cations have immense importance in biomedical
analysis and environmental monitoring.1,2 The techniques
like inductively coupled plasma mass/atomic emission spectroscopy,
atomic absorption spectroscopy,3 colorimetry,4 spectrophotometry,5−7 and voltammetry8 generally require sophisticated expensive equipment,
tedious time-consuming sample preparation procedure, and trained skilled
operator. In contrast, fluorescence spectroscopy is very useful to
provide instantaneous detection, visual perception, and inexpensive
methodology that excludes sample pretreatment. A single probe capable
to sense multiple ions is cost-effective and highly desirable for
practical applications.9 Particularly,
a probe that selectively and specifically detects and discriminates
elements belonging to the same group in the periodic table through
the photo-induced electron transfer–chelation-enhanced fluorescence–fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (PET–CHEF–FRET) processes
in a ratiometric manner is highly demanding as well as difficult to
achieve10 because it rules out the adverse
environmental effects like pH, polarity, probe concentration, and
excitation power on the emission intensity via built-in correction
to the signal ratio of emission intensities at two different wavelengths.11−13

Although Al is extensively used in food packaging, cookware,
antiperspirants,
drinking water supplies, bleached flour, deodorants, antacids, manufacturing
of cars, and computers,14−16 it may cause neurotoxicity, disorders
of homeostasis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), microcytic hypochromic
anemia, myopathy, and anemia.17−22 It also inhibits plant growth by increasing
the acidity of the soil.23

Zinc,
the most biocompatible metal,24−27 is present in all forms of life28 and plays a vital role in numerous biological
processes including brain activity, gene transcription, immune function,
etc.29 Zn2+-based compounds
are used as radioprotective agents,30 tumor
photosensitizers,31 antidiabetic insulin-mimetic,32 antibacterial, antimicrobial, and anticancer
agents.33 It also reduces cardio- and hepatotoxicity
induced by some anticancer drugs.34 Its
abnormal metabolism causes health problems like prostate cancer, delayed
sexual maturation and impotence, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ALS, Wilson’s
diseases, age-related macular degeneration,35−37 AD,38 cerebral ischemia,39 epilepsy,40 and acrodermatitis enteropathica.41

On the other hand, Cd occupies the seventh
position among the top
20 hazardous substances in the priority list prepared by the Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the US Environmental
Protection Agency.42 The World Health Organization
allows a maximum of 3 ppb Cd2+ in drinking water.43 Cd released from Ni–Cd batteries, phosphate
fertilizers, pigments, and semiconducting quantum dots/rods44 causes renal dysfunction, calcium metabolism
disorders, reduced lung capacity, risk of cancer, and health disorders.45 Thus, the determination of trace-level Cd2+ in environmental and biological samples has great significance.

Finally, it is well-known that Hg damages kidney, skin, respiratory
system, central nervous system, and other organs.46,47 It is observed in the literature that most of the reported probes
relevant to these cations either detect one or dual cations.48−50

Moreover, very few fluorescence probes detect and discriminate
Zn2+ and Cd2+. In most cases, Cd2+ interferes with Zn2+ sensing.51a A simple turn-on probe51b for the detection of both Zn2+ and
Cd2+ suffers limitations such as narrow difference in emission
wavelengths (λEm for Zn2+, 572 nm and
λEm for Cd2+, 565 nm) and low detection
limit. An amino-terpyridine-based probe51c detects both Zn2+ and Cd2+ with an incremental
enhancement of emission intensity at 535 nm but fails to discriminate
Zn2+ and Cd2+. Chen et al.51d have reported a turn-on fluorescence probe for Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ that also fails to discriminate
them.

It is to be noted that the molecular arithmetic that converts
a
chemically encoded analysis (input) into an optical signal52,53 (output) is potentially an interesting research area in modern unconventional
computing system54 that insisted us to
construct a scientific logic gate using our present probe.

Rhodamine
derivatives possess excellent photophysical properties,
viz. high quantum yield,55 photostability,
bioavailability, excitation, and emission in the visible region,55 and undergo an equilibrium between the nonfluorescent
“spirolactam ring” and fluorescent “ring-open”
forms to allow analyte sensing through “off–on”
switching.56 Herein, a smart probe is being
reported that selectively detects and discriminates Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, utilizing
their significantly different emission wavelengths and eye-catching
colors under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light. The ratiometric sensing
mechanism involves PET–CHEF–FRET processes. The ability
of RHES for imaging intracellular Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ have been demonstrated in live cells.

Results
and Discussion
Colorless RHES displays a very
weak emission at 397
nm (λEx, 306 nm, Scheme 1, Figure S1, Supporting Information). In the presence of Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, RHES turns pink
(Al3+), green (Zn2+), sky blue (Cd2+), and intense bloodred (Hg2+) (λEx,
306 nm) (Figure 1).
Additionally, for Al3+ and Hg2+, the solution
looks pink and red in bare eye (Figure 1). Interestingly, out of all the common ions tested,
the emission intensity enhances for Al3+ (51-fold along
with 176 nm red shift from 397 to 573 nm), Zn2+ (29-fold
along with 85 nm red shift from 397 to 482 nm), Cd2+ (36-fold
along with 2 nm blue shift from 397 to 395 nm), and Hg2+ (89-fold along with 180 nm red shift from 397 to 577 nm) (Figure 2).

and under UV light (right) in the presence of Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ (20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES)-buffered MeOH/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4)).

of RHES (the same media and pH mentioned above) in the
presence of the common
metal ions (λEx = 306 nm).

Scheme 1 Synthetic Protocols of RHES and R1
The spectroscopic properties
of RHES depend on the
pH of the media as it contains pH-susceptible donor sites. Moreover,
the biological application of RHES demands its efficiency
at a physiological pH. Hence, RHES is mixed with Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in
different sets at different pH values (pH 3.0–12.0). The difference
in emission intensities between the free RHES and its
metal ion adducts is highest near the physiological pH 7.4, and hence
chosen for the entire study (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

Figures 2 and 3a demonstrate the selectivity
of RHES for Al3+ (λEm = 573
nm). Figure S3 (Supporting Information)
indicates no interference
from the common cations. Upon a gradual addition of Al3+ (from 0.005 to 1600 μM), the colorless RHES slowly
turns sky blue, whereby the emission intensity increases at 362 nm.
After 25 min, the emission intensity gradually increases at 573 nm.
Further, with increasing time, the emission intensity at 362 nm remains
unaltered, whereas it increases at 573 nm. It is proposed that the
initial coordination of phenol −O and imine N to Al3+ is responsible for the weak emission at 362 nm. Subsequent coordination
by the −O donors from the carbonyl functionality of the spirolactam
moiety to Al3+ leads to fluorescence enhancement at 573
nm along with the opening of the spirolactam ring resulting in pink
coloration57 (Figure S4, Supporting Information). The time-dependent color changes
of the RHES–Al3+ system under a handheld
UV lamp are presented in Figure S4 (Supporting Information). Figure 3b shows the fluorescence titration of RHES by
Al3+. RHES detects as low as 1.5 × 10–9 M Al3+ (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Figure 3c shows the [Al3+] versus emission
intensity plot at 573 nm (red balls) and 362 nm (inset, sky blue balls).
The red shift of the emission band is accompanied by a 51-fold fluorescence
enhancement (λEm, 573 nm; Φ, 6.6-fold enhancement).
Moreover, in the presence of Al3+, 1.5-fold increase of F573/F362 is observed
(Figure S6, Supporting Information). The
plot of fluorescence enhancement versus [Al3+] at different
wavelengths is shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The UV–vis titration of RHES with Al3+ shows the appearance of two new bands at 406
and 555 nm (Figure 3d), indicating the interaction of RHES with Al3+. Job’s plot supports a 1:1 stoichiometry (mole ratio) between RHES and Al3+ (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The mass spectrum of the [RHES–Al3+] adduct also affirms this composition. The binding constant
of RHES for Al3+ is 1.33 × 105 (Figure S8, Supporting Information).

and 1600 μM) (λEx = 306 nm); (c) plot of emission
intensities of RHES vs [Al3+] at 573 nm (red
balls) and at 362 nm (sky blue balls, inset), λEx = 306 nm; (d) changes in the absorption spectra of RHES in the said media upon the gradual addition of Al3+ (same
as (b)).

In the presence of Zn2+, RHES experiences
a red shift of the emission band to bright green along with a 29-fold
fluorescence enhancement (λEm, 482 nm; λEx = 306 nm; Φ, 5.02-fold enhancement, Figure 4a) without any interference
from the other common cations (Figure S9, Supporting Information). With an increasing [Zn2+], the emission
intensity at 342 nm decreases in a ratiometric manner with an isoemissive
point at 419 nm (Figure S10, Supporting Information). The plot of emission intensities versus [Zn2+] at two
different wavelengths is shown in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). The fluorescence titration and emission
intensities versus [Zn2+] plots are shown in Figure 4b,c. The absence of bands at
573 nm/577 nm, responsible for bare eye pink/red color, indicates
the noninvolvement of the rhodamine moiety to coordinate to Zn2+. RHES efficiently detects Zn2+ at
the physiological pH of 7.4 (Figure S2, Supporting Information) and forms a 1:1 (mole ratio) complex at a low
[Zn2+], whereas a 1:2 (mole ratio) complex is formed at
a higher [Zn2+], as revealed from Job’s plot (Figure
S12, Supporting Information) and the mass
spectrum. The binding constant of 2.11 × 104 M–1 is indicative of a fairly strong interaction between RHES and Zn2+ (Figure S13, Supporting Information). The UV–vis titration of RHES versus Zn2+ is presented in Figure 4d. RHES can detect
Zn2+ as low as 1.2 × 10–9 M (Figure 4c, inset).

MeOH/H2O, 4/1, v/v, pH 7.4) with increasing [Zn2+] (0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 200, 300,
500, 1000, and 1600 μM); (c) plot of emission intensities of RHES with added Zn2+ (0.05–1600 μM)
at 482 nm (red balls); (d) changes in the absorption spectra of RHES with increasing [Zn2+] (same as (b)).

In the presence of Cd2+, RHES shows a sky
blue fluorescence (λEm = 395 nm, λEx = 306 nm, Figure 5a) without any interference from the common cations (Figure S14, Supporting Information). A gradual addition of
Cd2+ enhances the emission intensity at 395 nm, while it
decreases at 347 nm in a ratiometric manner with an isoemissive point
at 368 nm (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The plots of emission intensities versus [Cd2+] at
two different wavelengths are shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information). The fluorescence titration with Cd2+ (0.05–1600 μM) and concentration versus fluorescence
intensity are shown in Figure 5b,c. The absence of the fluorescence bands at 573 nm/577 nm
at fluorescence titration and at 555 nm at UV titration of RHES with Cd2+ also confirm that there is no coordination
with the rhodamine ring (Figure 5d). At a physiological pH (pH = 7.4), RHES is also efficient to detect Cd2+ (Figure S2, Supporting Information). RHES forms a 1:1 complex with Cd2+ at a low Cd2+ concentration
and a 1:2 at a higher concentration, which is confirmed from Job’s
plot (Figure S17, Supporting Information) and the mass spectra of the RHES–Zn2+ complex. The blue shift of the emission band is accompanied by a
36-fold fluorescence enhancement for Cd2+ at its emission
point (λEm, 395 nm; Φ, 4.3-fold enhancement).
The binding constant between RHES and Cd2+ is also high enough to form a stable complex (1.35 × 105 M–1) (Figure S18, Supporting Information). RHES can detect Cd2+ as
low as 6.27 × 10–9 M (Figure 5c, inset).

100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 1200, and 1600 μM) (λEx = 306 nm); (c) plot of the emission intensities of RHES (20 μM) as a function of externally added Cd2+ (0.05–1600

of RHES (20 μM) in 20 mM HEPES-buffered MeOH/H2O (4/1, v/v, pH 7.4) upon the gradual addition of Cd2+ (same as (b)).

In the presence of Hg2+, the emission band of RHES undergoes a red
shift with an 89-fold fluorescence enhancement
(λEm, 577 nm; λEx = 306 nm; Φ,
6.5-fold increase; Figure 6a while its solution color turns intense bloodred under UV
light and bare eye (Figure 1). Upon a gradual addition of Hg2+, the emission
intensity at 375 nm decreases in a ratiometric manner with an isoemissive
point at 526 nm (Figure S19, Supporting Information). The plot of emission intensity versus [Hg2+] at two
different wavelengths is shown in Figure S20 (Supporting Information). The fluorescence titration spectra
and the plot of emission intensity versus [Hg2+] are shown
in Figure 6b,c. The
UV–vis titration of RHES versus [Hg2+] is presented in Figure 6d. The optimum pH for the entire study has been determined
from Figure S2 (Supporting Information)
as 7.4. Figure S21 (Supporting Information) reveals that the common cations do not interfere with the determination
of Hg2+. Similar to Al3+, Hg2+ also
forms a 1:1 (mole ratio) adduct with RHES, realized from
Job’s plot (Figure S22, Supporting Information) and supported by the mass spectrum. The strong interaction between RHES and Hg2+ is indicated from the binding constant,
4.09 × 105 M–1 (Figure S23, Supporting Information). RHES detects
as low as 1.7 × 10–10 M Hg2+ (Figure 6c, inset).

presence of Hg2+ and other common metal ions (λEx = 306 nm, λEm = 577 nm, red bar); (b) changes
in the emission spectra of RHES with increasing [Hg2+] (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10, 50, 100,
200, 500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, and 1600 μM); (c) plot of emission
intensities of RHES as a function of added Hg2+ (0.005–1600 μM, red balls); (d) changes in the absorption
spectra of RHES with increasing [Hg2+] (same
concentration as (b), along with some more such as 20, 30, 75, 150,
and 250 μM) (same media as mentioned earlier).

As the literature suggests, probably the present
study is the first
report of a single sensor that detects and discriminates Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ through the
generation of different colors upon irradiation of UV light and also
observable in bare eye (Figure S24, Supporting Information).

Al3+ shifts the emission maxima
of RHES from 397 nm (characteristic of PET, from the
imine N-to the conjugated
3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde moiety) to 573 nm (characteristic of rhodamine
B, FRET) via an intermediate CHEF process having a characteristic
emission at 362 nm. Al3+ being a hard acid prefers an “O”
donor from 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde. The absorption at 406 nm also
indicates the interaction between Al3+ and the “O”
donor from 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde (Figure 3d). Thus, upon excitation at 306 nm, the
fluorescence at 362 nm enhances because of the CHEF process which
subsequently transfers energy to excite the rhodamine moiety.

However, Hg2+ being a soft acid does not prefer the
hard “O” donor, and hence the CHEF process is absent.
Rather, a significant overlap between 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde emission
(donor) and rhodamine absorption (acceptor) has been observed (Figure
S25, Supporting Information). Upon the
addition of Hg2+, the emission maximum of free RHES is red-shifted from 397 to 577 nm (λEx, 306 nm),
indicating an energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor.

The slow interaction between RHES and Al3+ allows the intermediate CHEF process visible. With time, the intensity
at 573 nm gradually increases, and finally it moves over to 362 nm.
Hence, an intense pink fluorescence and bare eye pink coloration are
observed (Figure S26, Supporting Information). The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the interaction has been
estimated as 0.0413 min–1 by monitoring the changes
in the emission intensity at 573 nm (Figure S27, Supporting Information). The proposed binding mechanism is
further substantiated by a control experiment using a model compound R1 that lacks −OH functionality. In the presence of
Al3+/Hg2+, the emission spectra of R1 are significantly different (Figures S28, S29, Supporting Information) while their QTOF–MS spectra
support the formation of the adduct (Figures S30, S31, Supporting Information). On the basis of these
facts, a probable interaction mechanism of RHES with
Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ is shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Proposed Binding Mechanism
As far as the emission profile is concerned (Figure S32, Supporting Information), Zn2+/Cd2+ do not show any significant interaction with R1, suggesting the necessity and involvement of the phenol −OH
for their sensing. For a deeper understanding of the binding mode
of RHES and to strengthen the proposed sensing mechanism, 1H NMR titration has been conducted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6. After the addition of 1 equiv Al3+/Hg2+ to RHES, the alkane protons downfield-shifted
from 3.45 to 3.50 ppm, indicating the interaction of the adjacent
O donors with the cations. Upon the addition of more Al3+/Hg2+ (2.0 and 3.0 equiv), these protons further downfield-shifted
to 3.54 ppm. Moreover, the ring protons upfield-shifted from 7.0 to
6.95 ppm, which indicates the opening of the spirolactam ring. Interestingly,
after the addition of 1 equiv Al3+/Hg2+ to RHES, the “p” proton downfield-shifted
from 8.6 to 10.2 ppm (Al3+) and 10.3 ppm (Hg2+) because of the close proximity of the rhodamine B unit through
the Al3+/Hg2+-induced folding of RHES. A further addition of Al3+/Hg2+ (2.0 and
3.0 equiv) shifts the “p” proton more downfield.
The position of the “v” proton of RHES remains unchanged upon the addition of Hg2+, indicating the noninteraction of the −OH group with Hg2+, whereas it shifts downfield from 12.01 to 12.44 for Al3+, confirming the interaction of the −OH group with
Al3+ (Figures S33, S34, Supporting Information).

Similarly, the addition of 1 equiv of Zn2+/Cd2+ to RHES shifts the alkane protons
downfield from 3.5
to 3.6 ppm, indicating the interaction of the adjacent O donors to
the metal ions. These protons are further downfield-shifted upon the
addition of more Zn2+/Cd2+ (2.0 and 3.0 equiv).
Moreover, the CH=N proton (“p” proton)
is downfield-shifted from 8.75 to 10.25 ppm, whereas the “v” proton shifts downfield from 12.0 to 12.37, indicating
the involvement of the −OH group to Zn2+/Cd2+ binding (Figures S35, 36, Supporting Information).

To further support the sensing mechanism,
fluorescence lifetime
measurement is carried out. The average lifetime (τ) of RHES is 0.3852 ns, whereas the corresponding values for RHES–Al3+ (λEm = 573 nm)
and RHES–Hg2+ (λEm = 577 nm) systems are 1.7497 and 1.7257 ns, respectively. The τ
values for the RHES–Zn2+ (λEm = 482 nm) and RHES–Cd2+ (λEm = 395 nm) systems are 1.2791 and 1.5333 ns, respectively
(Table S1, Supporting Information). The
τ value of [RHES–Al3+] at 362
nm is 0.8399 ns (Table S1, Figure S37, Supporting Information). The fluorescence lifetime decay curves along
with data fitting are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Fluorescence lifetime decay of RHES and (a)
[RHES–Al3+], (b) [RHES–Zn2+], (c) [RHES–Hg2+], and (d)
[RHES–Cd2+] adducts at the corresponding
emission wavelengths.

Interestingly, the higher affinity and association constant
of RHES for Cd2+ allows easy replacement of
Zn2+ from the [RHES–Zn2+] adduct
to form a more stable [RHES–Cd2+] adduct
(Scheme 3). Thus, the
[RHES–Zn2+] adduct turns out to be
a better Cd2+ sensor that functions via the displacement
approach. The gradual addition of Cd2+ to the [RHES–Zn2+] system results in a blue shift of the 482
nm emission band to 395 nm along with a fluorescence enhancement (Figure 8).

Figure 8 (a) Changes in the fluorescence
spectra of the [RHES–Zn2+] adduct upon
the addition of Cd2+; (b) changes in the absorbance spectra
of the [RHES–Zn2+] adduct upon the
addition of Cd2+.

Scheme 3 Easy Replacement of Zn2+ by Cd2+ from
the [RHES–Zn2+] Adduct
It is worth mentioning that the simultaneous
presence of Al3+ and Hg2+ can be visualized
(Scheme 4) using KI
to mask Hg2+, while KI does not interfere with the emission
profile of RHES (Figure S38, Supporting Information). This fact is also supported from the mass spectrum
of the resulting
mixture (Figure S39, Supporting Information). Figure S40 (Supporting Information)
pictorially represents the reversibility of the probe toward Hg2+ detection. After the addition of the mixture of Al3+ and Hg2+ to RHES, the characteristic emission
of the [RHES–Hg2+] adduct at 577 nm
is observed, attributed to the higher affinity of Hg2+ for RHES. The higher binding constant of [RHES–Hg2+] over [RHES–Al3+] also supports
the observation (Figures S8, S23, Supporting Information). Figure S41 (Supporting Information)
also indicates the formation of the [RHES–Hg2+] adduct (m/z, 1007.86)
when the mixture of Al3+ and Hg2+ is added to RHES. Moreover, after the addition of I– to this system, the emission shifts to 573 nm, which is characteristic
of the [RHES–Al3+] adduct. After the
addition of I–, it captures Hg2+ while
only Al3+ binds to RHES, showing an emission
at 573 nm. The I–-assisted reversible interaction
between the probe RHES and Hg2+ is also established
from the 1H NMR titration (Figure S42, Supporting Information). Upon the addition of 1 equiv Hg2+ to the [RHES–Al3+] adduct,
the “V” proton of RHES upfield-shifted
from 12.34 to 12.15 ppm, indicating the noninteraction of the −OH
group with Hg2+ and the replacement of Al3+ by
Hg2+. Upon further addition of I– (1
equiv) to the resulting solution, the “V” proton is
downfield-shifted from 12.15 to 12.34 ppm, indicating the interaction
of the −OH group of RHES. This is due to the interaction
of Al3+ present in the system with the free RHES. The formation of this [RHES–Al3+] adduct is also demonstrated from its Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrum (Figure S43, Supporting Information).

Scheme 4 Role of the Masking Agent (KI) for Simultaneous Detection of
Al3+ and Hg2+
Table S2 (Supporting Information) compares
the present probe with the available probes in the literature, although
it is not truly a comparison because none of the available single
probes can detect all the four cations simultaneously as demonstrated
in the present report.

To obtain the energy-optimized geometries
of RHES and
its Al3+, Hg2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ adducts (Figure S44, Supporting Information), density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations57 have been performed. The Gaussian-09 revision C.01 program
package is used for all calculations. The geometries in gas phase
are fully optimized without any restrictions of symmetry in singlet
ground states for RHES and its adducts, viz. [Al(RHES)(NO3)3], [Zn(RHES)(CH3CH2OH)2(CH3OH)(NO3)]+, [Cd(RHES)(CH3CH2OH)(CH3COO)], and [Hg(RHES)(NO3)]+, along with the gradient-corrected DFT level with
the three-parameter fit of exchange and correlation functional of
Becke (B3LYP), which includes the correlation functional of Lee, Yang
and Parr (LYP).57b The basis set LanL2DZ
along with an effective core potential is employed for Al, Zn, Cd,
and Hg atoms following the associated valence double-ζ basis
set of Hay and Wadt57c along with the 6-31++G**
basis set, chosen for hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. The highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) of RHES and its adducts are shown in Figure
S45 (Supporting Information). It is clear
that the Al3+, Hg2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ adducts are stabilized by 0.06227, 0.03886, 0.0721, and
0.07823 eV, respectively. In [RHES–Al3+] and [RHES–Hg2+], the HOMOs are found
to be majorly localized on the rhodamine moiety, whereas these are
localized on the aldehyde moiety in the case of the [RHES–Zn2+] and [RHES–Cd2+] adducts. The corresponding LUMOs are found to be minorly localized
on the rhodamine moiety. Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations have
been performed on the excited state based on the optimized ground-state
geometry in the Conductor-like Polarizable Continuum Model (CPCM).
The electronic transition energies are calculated by the TDDFT method
in methanol and gas phase (Tables S3–S7, Supporting Information). The outcomes are in good agreement
with our experimental data. The results reveal that the energy gap
between HOMO and LUMO of its adducts is reasonably lower than that
of the free RHES, leading to a more stable species.

Considering the emission wavelengths of Zn2+ and Cd2+ and the displacement of Zn2+ by Cd2+, a binary logic gate has been constructed.58 There are two input signals, viz. input X (Zn2+) and
input Y (Cd2+), whereas the output signals correspond to
the turn-on emission at 482 nm for Zn2+ and 395 nm for
Cd2+. For input, Zn2+/Cd2+ is defined
as the “1” state and absence of any as the “0”
state. Our system uses the OR gate and the combination of OR and NOT
gates along with a switch that describes the situation clearly. When
the input is applied through an individual, both ions follow the OR
gate, and when both Zn2+/Cd2+ are the inputs,
the pathway is changed (Figure 9).

emission intensity as the output.

Imaging Studies
Imaging System
The imaging system
is composed of an
inverted fluorescence microscope Leica DM 1000 LED, a digital compact
camera Leica DFC 420C, and an image processor Leica Application Suite
v3.3.0. The microscope is equipped with a 50 W mercury arc lamp in
a 25 min interval after incubation with the said ions to RHES.

Staining with RHES
The slides are deparaffinized
in xylene, hydrated through a graded series of ethanol, equilibrated
in 1 mL Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO2,
incubated with RHES for 2 min, washed several times with
2% DMSO, and observed under a fluorescence microscope.

Image Analysis
RHES efficiently images
Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in squamous
epithelial cells under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 10). The cells are cultured
in a 35 mm culture plate at a seeding density of 40 × 104 cell/35 mm in 1 mL DMEM with 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5%
CO2. To explore the suitability of RHES for
the bioimaging of Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, the cells are incubated in the presence or absence of 20 mg mL–1 of RHES for 2 h at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 in a culture medium. Before this, the cells are subcultured
using 0.25% trypsin–0.53 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
solution in a 60 mm plate. The cells are washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (×2), and after washing with PBS (×3), the
remaining compounds are removed, and the cells are incubated with
the said ions and observed under a fluorescence microscope equipped
with a UV filter at ambient temperature. No fluorescence is observed
in the cells (Figure 10, RHES) that are not previously exposed to the metal
ions, whereas after the addition of the said ions, the nonfluorescence
gradually turns green with time for Zn2+, sky blue for
Cd2+, and red for Hg2+. Moreover, RHES can easily permeate through the tested living cells without causing
any harm (as the cells remain alive even after 2 h of exposure to RHES). The cells treated only with the said ions have no fluorescence.
This intracellular imaging clearly shows that RHES has
good cell permeability and is efficient for imaging of the said cations.

Application
Real Sample
Analysis
To evaluate the practical feasibility
of RHES for the determination of Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, analyses of the real
samples have been performed.9,58 The results are summarized
in Tables 1–4, respectively. Table 1 indicates the excellent
recovery of metal ions from both water and the antacid samples, opening
a new avenue for the determination of Al3+ in pharmaceutical
formulations and water samples. The method has also been employed
successfully for the determination of Zn2+ in water and
commercially available antacid-suspension supplements (Table 3). Tables 2 and 4 indicate the
determination of Hg2+ and Cd2+ ions in sea fish
samples, respectively. The results indicate excellent recoveries of
the said cations from the real samples.

Fish
Assays
Collection and Storage
The fish samples are collected
from the coastal areas of West Bengal (Digha), India, during January,
2016. Eight fishes, namely subgenus Thunnus, Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Loligoduvauceli, Setipinna sp, Johnieopsvogleri, Stolephorusindicus, Pampus argenteus, and Parupeneusindicus are collected
from the coastal areas. The body weight and length of the fishes are
measured prior to dissection. The muscle sample is collected and stored
in sterile polythene bags and kept in the laboratory deep freezer
(−20 °C) to prevent deterioration till further analysis.

Analysis
The developed method is used to determine
Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions quantitatively in sea fish
samples. To obtain the samples in the form of dry powder, the fishes
are lyophilized using a Virtis freeze mobile 6EL lyophilizer (UGC-DAE
CSR, Kolkata). As the accumulated Cd2+ and Hg2+ in the fish samples are in covalent form, they are not suitable
for fluorescence measurements. Hence, the fish samples are digested in a minimum volume of concentrated
HNO3 to obtain Cd2+ and Hg2+ in salt
form. The sample preparation and analysis procedures are presented
in the Supporting Information. The concentrations
of Cd2+ and Hg2+ are measured by the standard
addition method using the linear plot, as in Figure S46 (Supporting Information). The emission intensity
is measured at pH 7.4.

Recovery Studies of Zn2+ and Al3+
RHES is also used
for the determination of Al3+ and Zn2+ in real
samples following the standard addition
method described above through spiking the known amounts of these
two metal ions at different concentration levels. The results are
summarized in Tables 1 and 3. The sample preparation and analysis
procedures are presented in the Supporting Information. Using the calibration graph (Figure S47, Supporting Information), the amounts of unknown Al3+ and Zn2+ have been determined.

Conclusion
The
synthesis, characterization, and application of a very simple
fluorescence and colorimetric probe, RHES, is described. RHES is exploited for the detection of nanomolar Al3+, Zn2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ ions in a
ratiometric manner involving the PET–CHEF–FRET processes.
The method allows their bare eye visualization at a physiological
pH. It detects as low as 1.5 × 10–9 M Al3+, 1.2 × 10–9 M Zn2+, 6.7
× 10–9 M Cd2+, and 1.7 × 10–10 M Hg2+. Furthermore, RHES successfully images the cations that belong to the same group of
the modern periodic table, viz. Zn2+, Cd2+,
and Hg2+, in living cells. The developed method is useful
for the determination of the said ions in real and sea fish samples. RHES, a multi-ion sensor, has been used to construct a binary
logic gate. The DFT studies support the experimental findings.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
High-purity HEPES buffer, rhodamine
B, 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde, 4-formylbenzonitrile, and 2-[2-(2-amino-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethylamine
have been purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (India). Hg(NO3)2·6H2O, Al(NO3)3·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and
Cd(AcO)2·4H2O are purchased from Merck
(India). Spectroscopic grade solvents are used. All metal salts used
are of either nitrate or acetate form. The other chemicals are of
analytical reagent grade and used without further purification. Ultrapure
Milli-Q Millipore 18.2 MΩ cm–1 water is used
whenever required. A Shimadzu Multi Spec 2450 spectrophotometer is
used for recording the UV–vis spectra. The FTIR spectra are
recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR (model IRPrestige 21 CE) spectrophotometer.
The mass spectra are recorded with a QTOF 60 Micro YA 263 mass spectrometer
in ES-positive mode. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra are measured with Bruker ADVANCE 400 (400 MHz) and 300 (75
MHz) spectrometers. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements
are performed with a picosecond-pulsed diode laser-based time-correlated
single-photon counting spectrometer (IBH, UK, λex = 380 nm) coupled to an MCP-PMT detector. The data are fitted to
multiexponential functions after the deconvolution of the instrument
response function by an iterative reconvolution technique using the
IBH DAS 6.2 data analysis software. The steady-state emission and
excitation spectra are recorded with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorimeter.
A digital SYSTRONICS pH meter (model 335) is used for pH measurement.

Synthesis of RHE
2-[2-(2-Amino-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethylamine
(7.0 mL, 12.42 mmol, ρ = 1.015 g mL–1) is
added dropwise to 1.1 g rhodamine B (2.29 mmol) in methanol (30 mL)
under stirring condition at room temperature. The mixture is refluxed
for 4 days at 60 °C (Scheme 1). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using
a rotary evaporator. Then, HCl (1 mol L–1) is added
until the solution becomes clear. The pH of the solution is adjusted
to 9–10 using NaOH (1 mol L–1). A red precipitate
that appeared is filtered, washed with water, dried under a vacuum,
and assigned as RHE, 2-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)-3′,6′-bis(diethylamino)spiro[isoindoline-1,9′-xanthen]-3-one
