Decabromodiphenyl
ether (BDE-209/decaBDE) is a high-production-volume
brominated flame retardant in China, where the decaBDE commercial
mixture is manufactured in Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province, even after
the prohibition of penta- and octaBDE mixtures. The demand for flame
retardants produced in China has been increasing in recent years as
China not only produces electronic devices but also has numerous electronic
waste (e-waste) recycling regions, which receive e-wastes from both
domestic and foreign sources. High concentrations of BDE-209 have
been observed in biotic and abiotic media in each of the different
areas, especially within the decaBDE manufacturers and e-waste recycling
areas. BDE-209 has been viewed as toxic and bioaccumulative because
it might debrominate to less brominated polybrominated diphenyl ethers
(PBDEs) (lower molecular weight and hydrophobicity), which are more
readily absorbed by organisms. The highest concentration of PBDEs
in dust within urban areas reached 40 236 ng g–1 in the Pearl River Delta, and BDE-209 contributed the greatest proportion
to the total PBDEs (95.1%). Moreover, the maximum hazard quotient
was found for toddlers (0.703) for BDE-209, which was close to 1.
This suggests that exposure to BDE-209 might lead to increased potential
for adverse effects and organ harm (e.g., the lungs) through inhalation,
dust ingestion, and dermal absorption, especially for the group of
toddlers compared to others. In daily food and human tissues, the
amount of BDE-209 was also extensively detected. However, the toxicity
and adverse effect of BDE-209 to humans are still not clear; thus,
further studies are required to better assess the toxicological effects
and exposure scenarios, a more enhanced environmental policy for ecological
risks regarding BDE-209 and its debrominated byproducts in China.

1 Introduction
Polybrominated
diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are used as brominated flame
retardants (BFRs) in textile, plastic, and electronic industries and
are organobromine compounds consisting of up to 10 bromine atoms.
However, many PBDEs have multiple congeners, and typically, commercial
PBDE products are a mixture of congeners rather than a single compound.
Three of these mixtures, pentaBDE, octaBDE, and decaBDE, were 14,
6, and 80%, respectively, of the estimated 67 000 t PBDE produced
annually worldwide.1 The major constituents
of pentaBDE are BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-100, with lesser contributions
from BDE-153, BDE-154, and BDE-85. The major congener found in octaBDE
is BDE-183 with minor contributions from BDE-203 and several octa-
and nonaBDEs.2 DecaBDE consists predominantly
of the congener BDE-209 (≥97%), with low levels of other brominated
diphenyl ether congeners such as nonaBDE (0.3–3%) and octaBDE
(0–0.04%).3 The physicochemical
properties of BDE-209 are summarized in Table S1. The global demand for flame retardants has been rising
over the past decade, especially considering the growth in consumption
of electronics and electrical products, which are continually being
replaced with new and more innovative products. BDE-209 is widespread
and one of the most prevalent PBDEs in the global environment.3 Furthermore, it is estimated that Asia accounted
for approximately half of the consumption of flame retardants in the
world, and China is considered to have the highest demand for flame
retardants in Asia.4

As an additive
flame retardant, decaBDE is not chemically bound
to the product or the material in which it is used. Therefore, it
has the potential to “leak” into the surrounding environment,
although low water solubility (<20–30 μg L–1) and vapor pressure (<10–6 mmHg at 20 °C)
of BDE-209 retard its release and limit mobility.5 The distribution of BDE-209 in environmental matrices across
China is shown in Figure 1. In spite of long environmental half-life and persistence
of BDE-209 in air, soil, and sediments, there exists substantial evidence
that BDE-209 can debrominate to lesser brominated PBDEs that range
from mono- to nonaBDEs in abiotic environment and biota. Mono- to
nonaBDEs include listed persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such
as tetra- to heptaBDEs and bromophenols,3 which are more readily taken up by organisms because of their lower
molecular weight. Additionally, some environmental conditions favor
debromination, likely forming congeners with greater toxicity and
bioaccumulation.5 For example, when BDE-209
bounds with artificial and natural soil, sediment, and sand, photolytic
debromination of BDE-209 can occur.6−8 Ahn et al. observed that
BDE-209 absorbed more readily to matrices consisting of clay minerals,
metal oxides, and sediments that can debrominate to tri- to nona-PBDEs
under exposure of 14-day sunlight irradiation.8 Some studies have revealed the biotransformation of BDE-209. Rainbow
trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and common
carp (Cyprinus carpio) were fed cod
spiked with BDE-209; BDE-209 was not detected in the fish, but hexa-
to nonaBDE congeners were.9 Metabolic debromination
of BDE-209 occurs in the roots and shoots of aquatic plants from a
wastewater receiving stream.5 Deng et al.
observed that a significant proportion of pentaBDE and octaBDE was
debrominated from decaBDE in the roots of aquatic plants through simulated
pot experiments.10 The same phenomenon
was observed in the soil–plant system under a greenhouse pot
experiment.11 DecaBDE was also proven to
be labile, forming debromination congeners photolytically in natural
matrices by using artificial sunlight.7 These reports demonstrate that penta- and octaBDE might have a greater
potential to bioaccumulate and cause toxicity.

water, and biota (terrestrial, aquatic, and human) in China.19,20,25−27,39,40,42−44,47,49,55,56,63,66,67,69,70,72,74,75,78−81,84,87,89,90,92−96,98−101,105,107,108,110−113,115,118,120,128,141−146

Because of widespread persistence
and toxicity of PBDEs in the
environment, as well as the potential hazard to humans, the manufacturing
and utilization of PBDEs have been strictly regulated and have been
partially prohibited for the last 12 years. In addition, the POPs Review Committee examined a proposal by Norway to list decabromodiphenyl
ether under the Stockholm Convention on POPs and concluded that it
met the screening criteria specified in Annex D.3 Currently, BDE-209 is in the process of being added to
Annex A. The phasing out of PBDE production has been primarily voluntary,
whereas the phasing out of decaBDE was expected to be completed by
2012 in the United States.12 The European
Union decided to ban the use of mixtures of penta-, octa- (2004),
and decaBDE (2008) in electronic devices.13 In 2009, octaBDE and pentaBDE were added to the list of POPs, and
at a later stage, the decaBDE formulation.14 In China, commercial mixtures of pentaBDE were banned from production
in 2004, and octaBDE was never produced.4 In 2008, Albemarle Corporation (US) and Dead Sea Bromine Company
(Israel) started to produce decaBDE in China. Chemtura Corporation
(US) also produced decaBDE in China later. In 2016, several corporations
in China produced decaBDE, including Everkem, ICL-IP Europe, Tosoh
Corporation, Shouguang Weidong Chemical, Jinan Shangshan Chemical,
Shouguang Jinyingtai Chemical, Yuancheng Technology, Shouguang Tianyi
Chemical, Shandong Haiwang Chemical, and Jiangyin Suli Chemical.15 However, production volumes currently remain
unknown. Moreover, the demand for BFRs has reflected an increased
trend, exhibiting rapid increases in production (8% annually)16 while decaBDE accounted for approximately 45%
of total BFRs produced in 2006 with 36 000 t.17 The domestic manufacturing of decaBDE soared to approximately
41 500 t in 2005, which was substantially greater than the
26 000 t produced in 2000 but decreased to 20 500 t
in 2011.4 However, decaBDE continues to
be in use without any restrictive policy until now in China. The domestic
decaBDE manufacturing facilities of China are primarily situated in
Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province.18 China
is the second largest consumer in the world regarding the electronics
market, and it was assumed that it might even replace America as the
number one consumer in 2016. In 2005, consumption of the
decaBDE commercial mixture in China amounted to approximately 30 000
t.19 This figure was estimated to be 70 000
t by 2016, based on the increasing rate of approximately 8% annually
in domestic demand for BFRs, which were primarily taken over by decaBDE.20 Moreover, there are a considerable number of
electronic waste (e-waste) recycling regions, especially in southern
and southeastern China, where Guiyu (GY), Qingyuan (QY), and Taizhou
(TZ) have become renowned worldwide as industrial e-waste dismantling
regions.21−23 In fact, many covert family-run workshops in those
areas engage in disassembling electronic components by primitive methods
such as acid washing and open burning, which has been banned by the
Chinese government, thereby causing a substantial amount of PBDE emissions
from heating printed wiring boards.24 BDE-209
is a high-production-volume flame retardant added to appliances in
China. Therefore, numerous investigations throughout various different
environmental matrices in e-waste recycling areas in China have shown
that BDE-209 was the dominant PBDE congener and major BFR pollutant
in recent years.25−28

At present, China is the largest producer and supplier of
decaBDE
mixture.29 BDE-209 continues to be the
dominant congener in an ambient medium and still continues to be manufactured.
The half-life of BDE-209 in human blood from Swedish works engaged
in recycling process was estimated to be in the range of about a week,
whereas the corresponding value for BDE-183 was estimated to be of
3 weeks,30,31 which indicates that decaBDE is likely to
undergo rapid metabolism. Therefore, the excessive number of electronic
devices in China might pose the primary potential risk to the extensive
number of people who work with electronic devices nowadays. Human
exposure to BDE-209 has become a concern in the past decades, and
there are several studies regarding human exposure to BDE-209 in China,
where BDE-209 has been detected in breast milk, hair, and blood serum.32−37 Taking into account the above-mentioned decaBDE, particularly in
China, this article reviews the pollution status and distribution
of decaBDE as well as the debromination and other metabolites in the
biological and abiotic environment of China; the potential risk of
human exposure to decaBDE is also discussed. On the basis of the abundance
of data available, the most recent reports have been utilized to depict
the impact of decaBDE contamination on the environment centered on
its production or use.

2 Review Strategy
We systematically utilized the electronic databases, for example,
Web of Knowledge, ScienceDirect, ACS Publications, Google Scholar,
and so forth from 2005 up until February 2017, using the following
search terms: PBDEs, BDE-209, decaBDE, and decabromodiphenyl oxide,
China. Moreover, broad search terms, such as fire retardant and BFRs,
were also applied to ensure that there was no loss of any publications.
Scientific journals, official reports, conference proceedings, and
news reports that were discovered on the Internet were obtained. Our
search was not confined to the English language but included Chinese
as well. The references including the occurrence of BDE-209 in different
types of areas in China, information about decaBDE/BFR production
in China, human exposure of BDE-209, and degradation of BDE-209 were
selected. We classified the areas where different pollution levels
of BDE-209 in the biotic and abiotic environment of China were discovered,
according to 126 identified references.

3 BDE-209
Pollution Status in Different Regions
of China
3.1 e-Waste Recycling/Dismantling Areas
Environmental decaBDE is associated with the disposal of BDE-209-treated
electrical and electronic equipment that are composed of products
that have reached their end-of-life cycle. In China, it was estimated
that the generation of e-waste could reach up to 3.66 million metric
tons in 2010.4 The decaBDE content within
e-waste in China was estimated to be 1867 t.38 Of that amount of e-waste flow, 12% accounted for deserted consumer
electronics recovered for recycling, and only this small fraction
of e-waste flow will be sorted and treated for reuse or recovery of
base materials.38 From the reports, so
far, Guangdong Province appears to be the most contaminated area by
e-waste, including the three regions of Guangzhou (GZ), GY, and QY.
TZ in Zhejiang Province, where e-waste recycling activities have been
prominent since the late 1970s, has also been reported on extensively.
The levels of BDE-209 in the air, soil, and biota within these three
areas are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Concentrations of BDE-209 in air, soil, and biota in e-waste recycling/dismantling
areas of QY, GY, and TZ.25−27,39,40,42−44,47,56,63,66,67,147,148

3.1.1 Qingyuan
QY
county is located in
the Guangdong Province, 50 km north of GZ city, where more than 1300
dismantling and recycling workshops exist.26 About 700 000 t of e-waste are disposed off annually, within
an area of 330 km2, where it is processed primarily by
primitive methods (open burning, acid processing, and mechanical shredding).39 Moreover, abundances of total BDE-209 and nonaBDE
among PBDEs were discovered in muscle samples of free-range chickens
(78–82%) and ducks (70–81%) purchased from local farmlands
in QY. Additionally, when comparing the level of those fed with grain
and the soil where PBDE exposure to poultry could occur, the biodebromination
of BDE-209 might occur in chickens and ducks.26 However, the grain feed might not be a significant contributing
factor to BDE-209 or other PBDE congeners because of the apparent
difference in the concentrations of BDE-209 between chickens (2.7
ng g–1 lipid weight average) and ducks (0.35 ng
g–1 lipid weight average), which have diverse living
and feeding habits. Thus, it would appear that more polluted land-associated
characteristics such as dust and insects might be attributable to
the higher burden of BDE-209 in chickens.26 Luo et al. investigated the relationship between the concentrations
of BDE and five waterbird species near the e-waste recycling workshops
in QY, which revealed that the Chinese pond heron (Ardeola bacchus) and ruddy-breasted crake (Porzana fusca) were enriched with BDE-47, BDE-99,
and BDE-100, whereas the white-breasted waterhen (Amaurornis
phoenicurus) and common snipe (Gallinago
gallinago) accumulated BDE-153, BDE-183, and BDE-154
and slaty-breasted rail (Gallirallus striatus) showed a significantly different congener profile that pronounced
the accumulation of BDE-209, followed by BDE-153, and a higher nonaBDE
than other species.40 The considerable
level of nonaBDE in these species could be due to the preferential
uptake of nonaBDEs compared to that of decaBDEs because of the differences
in bioavailability and partitioning or also because of the biotransformation
from BDE-209. This was also discovered in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris).41 A
higher concentration of BDE-153 might also be closely linked to different
metabolic behaviors among different species, from BDE-209 or other
high brominated PBDEs. Evidence suggests that direct exposure to BDE-209
or its metabolites in the food chain, such as the consumption of insects
for birds and poultry, facilitates contact with BDE-209-contaminated
soil, especially at e-waste dumping and recycling sites, and is also
exposed to humans via diet. BDE-209 also showed a higher accumulation
in the liver of frogs (Rana limnocharis) sampled from e-waste-contaminated areas in QY than tri- to heptaBDE
congeners.42 The high fat content of the
liver might explain the deposition of BDE-209 because of its large
molecular size and low hydrophobicity, restricting it from crossing
membranes.42 Moreover, maternal transfer
of PBDEs has also been discovered in frogs whereas decaBDE transferred
less than tri- to heptaBDE, which might be due to its relatively large
molecular size.42

From the air samples
collected from QY by Tian et al., it was discovered that BDE-209 was
the most dominant congener in almost all air samples, accounting for
47 ± 17 and 59 ± 16% of the total PBDE congeners in e-waste
and rural areas, respectively.43 Using
equilibrium gas/particle partitioning theory, highly brominated BFRs,
such as BDE-209, are mainly formed as particle-bound BFRs that could
originate from the burning and shredding of e-wastes, resuspending
oil and dust, and the formation of secondary aerosols in the air.43 However, e-waste recycling in QY (low-latitude
areas) is a significant source of less brominated PBDEs because of
the emission being strongly temperature-dependent; thus, weak temperature
dependence at the rural site implies that they are likely to undergo
global transport.43 In comparison to the
relationship between concentrations of PBDEs in plant leaves and those
in the gaseous phase, particle phase, and leaf surface particle, PBDEs
in plants showed no clear correlation with particle-bound PBDEs in
the atmosphere; however, there is an exception where BDE-209 in eucalyptus
leaves exhibited a significant negative relationship (r = −0.67, p < 0.05).44 Highly brominated PBDEs (nona- and decaBDE) reflected a
lesser relationship within the same plant species, as compared to
less brominated BDEs, which might result from the high uptake rates
of highly brominated BDEs from leaf surface particles into leaves,
influencing the concentration of BDE-209 within leaf surface particles.44 The uptake mechanism is also connected to the
relationship between the log KPA (log
plant/air partition coefficient) and log KOA (log octanol/air partition coefficient) for BDE-209.44 This has also been proven by increasing cuticular
permeability with octanol/air partition coefficient (KOA) of semivolatile organic compounds.45 BDE-209 contributions in the plants of QY (60 and 50% average
of the total PBDE burden in eucalyptus leaves and pine needles, respectively)
were comparable to those in spruce needles in Ottawa, Canada (66%),
and tree bark in North America (60%).46

Wang et al. investigated the PBDEs in soils and plants in
QY (Longyang
and Shijiao, two administrative towns) and determined that BDE-209
was the predominant congener in all soil samples, accounting for 53.2–37.7%
of the total PBDE contents, whereas only relatively low levels of
BDE-209 were detected in woody plant roots [ranging from 0.3 ±
0.03 to 5.3 ± 0.6 ng g–1 dry weight (dw)],
accounting for 19.7% of the total PBDEs, while lower brominated PBDEs
(mono- through pentaBDE) account for 90.2% in the roots and 97.7%
in the leaves on average.47 This could
result from preferential root uptake and translocation for lower brominated
PBDEs and also metabolites from the debromination of higher brominated
PBDEs in plants.47 Moreover, the concentration
of BDE-209 in the soil ranged from 28.8 ng g–1 (paddy
field, 10–20 cm) to 468 ng g–1 (e-waste site,
0–10 cm) in QY, suggesting that the soil in QY has been polluted
by BDE-209, via e-waste recycling activities.48 Moreover, the concentration of BDE-209 was about 4-fold higher in
the surface soil from a peanut field than that in the paddy field,
which can be extrapolated by a different tillage or irrigation frequency
that might contribute to the different concentrations and account
for the transfer of PBDEs in the paddy and peanut fields in spite
of the similar proximity (<1 km) to the e-waste.48 The paddy field is more irrigated than the peanut field
because rice is a semiaquatic plant requiring more watering during
growth, which could cause increasing inputs of contaminant via irrigation
water. However, this paper showed lower concentration of BDE-209 in
the peanut field than that in the paddy field, indicating that the
fate of BDE-209 in the humid soil of the paddy field might be different
from that in the dry soil. Because of very low volatility of BDE-209,
low concentrations of BDE-209 in the topsoil of paddy field might
be mainly due to adsorption of particles linked with runoff and leaching.
In the sediment collected from a pond in QY, BDE-209 was also the
predominant congener with 65% of the total PBDEs.28 Wang et al. detected soil and plant samples from intensive
uncontrolled e-waste recycling sites near QY and agricultural fields
in close proximity to it.49 In this study,
among the total PBDEs, BDE-209 accounted for 36–91% as the
dominant congener in soil; this result was also consistent with the
fact that the commercial decaBDE mixture is frequently added to plastic
products used in high-tech and other electrical appliances in China
and accounts for the key contaminant in this region as previously
reported.49,50 This pattern was also detected in vegetables,
reflecting that BDE-209 was still the most predominant congener, followed
by BDE-47, in all plant samples, and the highest concentration of
BDE-209 was found in Brassica alboglabra L.49 The tissue-to-soil ratio of vegetables
(Cvegetable/Csoil) in these sites showed that the ratio of PBDEs without BDE-209 was
much higher than the ratio of BDE-209, which means that lower brominated
PBDEs were easier to be removed than the higher brominated PBDEs,
and the ratios of roots or tubers were lower than the ratios of shoots
in various vegetables. This suggests that PBDEs (including BDE-209)
in shoots might generally be derived from the atmosphere rather than
the soil. Another interesting finding is that B. alboglabra L. had the highest tissue-to-soil ratio of BDE-209, whereas Lactuca sativa L. had the highest tissue-to-soil
ratio of other congeners without BDE-209. This indicates that the
accumulation potential differs between the two species, which might
pose diverse potential risks to the vegetables planted in this ambient
area.49

3.1.2 Guiyu
GY is situated in Chaoyang
district, Shantou city, GZ Province, Southeast China, with a total
area of 52 km2 and a population of 150 000. This
town has been involved in e-waste dismantling/recycling (processes
about 70% of the exported e-waste of world) for approximately 20 years.22,25,51 According to reports on e-waste
treatment in GY, approximately 30 000 to 40 000 people
are involved in e-waste treatment, treating over 1 million tons of
e-waste annually.52 In the e-waste recycling
workshops of GY, the total concentration of suspended particulates
(TSP) in the air depicted a sustained growth throughout the working
period, suggesting a continuous TSP emission from all workshops.51 BDE-209 was the dominant congener at all sampling
sites relevant to TSP in off-site and on-site e-waste dismantling
workshops, which is likely to be particle-associated BDE-209 that
can adsorb fine particles more readily when compared to other low
brominated congeners. Despite the fact that BDE-209 is not influenced
by high temperature as much as low brominated congeners during the
process of incineration because of its high melting point (290–306
°C), these particles can easily volatilize.51,53,54 Although BDE-209 is associated with large
particles that might not be inhaled into human lungs, on-site e-waste
dismantling workshops continue to be the area that reflects the highest
exposure of all workshop employees according to the exposure assessment.51 Deng et al. also investigated TSP and particles
with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 μm (PM 2.5) at an e-waste
recycling site in GY and measured concentrations of 124 and 62.1 μg
m–3, respectively.22 The
same result was reflected with higher concentrations of PBDE observed
in the air because of the heating and open burning of e-waste when
plastics containing PBDEs were heated, whereas BDE-209 was not investigated.22 During both daytime and nighttime, the air samples
were collected from an e-waste recycling site in GY and BDE-209 was
found to be the predominant congener of all PBDEs (only in particle
phase, associated chemicals were detected), whereas the concentration
of BDE-209 did not show as high a concentration as in the Swedish
recycling plant in which commercial decaBDE was the most abundant.55 Moreover, when compared to the commercial decaBDE
mixture, BDE-209 exhibited a lower concentration (9.4–23% in
summer and 29.1–41.0% in winter).55

The surface soil exposed during e-waste recycling for an extended
period of time and the residue after combustion of e-waste from GY
were analyzed for PBDEs. The most dominant congener was BDE-209 that
accounted for 35–82%, indicating that the commercial decaBDE
was prevalent.25 The concentration of BDE-209
was statistically higher in soil samples at the acid leaching, riverbank,
and the printer roller dump site and was greater than that discovered
at the rice field, reservoir, and duck pond.25 The concentration of BDE-209 was approximately 3-fold to 5-fold
higher than the total concentration from mono- to nonaBDE in the duck
pond, rice field, riverbank, and reservoir, which suggested that the
commercial decaBDE mixture is highly prevalent in GY and thus represents
tremendous inputs into the environment.25 However, it is uncertain whether decaBDE debrominated to low bromine
BDE (i.e., BDE-47 and BDE-99). An analysis of Pearson’s correlations
revealed no significant correlations between BDE-209 and BDE-47 (probability
levels of 0.05) and between BDE-209 and BDE-99 (probability levels
of 0.01) at the printer roller dump site, rice field, duck pond, and
the reservoir, suggesting that BDE-47 and BDE-99 did not come from
the debromination of BDE-209. Huang et al. studied the dissipation
of PBDEs and plant uptake in soil from e-waste recycling sites in
GY, where higher proportions of low brominated PBDEs such as BDE-47,
BDE-66, and BDE-99 in plant roots were found much more than those
in the soil, whereas BDE-209 was found to have lower proportions in
plant roots than those in the soil.56 This
illustrates that higher brominated PBDEs such as BDE-209 are not easily
absorbed by plants from the soil. In comparison to lower and higher
brominated PBDEs, there are higher eradication rates (16.1–34.8%)
in lower brominated PBDEs (9.4–17.7%), irrespective of plant
or soil species.56 The contribution for
dissipation of BDE-209 might be due to plant uptake, and losses might
be caused by volatilization and degradation by the microorganisms
in the soil. The low dissipation for BDE-209 is
ascribed to higher partition coefficients, and BDE-209 is strongly
bound to the soil (particularly soil organic matter), thereby becoming
less degradable by the microorganisms in the soil. Moreover, the hydroxylated
PBDEs (OH-PBDEs) were found in aerosol samples from a printed circuit
board’s recycling workshop in GY when waste printed circuit
boards were heated with temperatures ranging from 250 to 300 °C,
in which the most abundant congener was 6-OH-BDE-47 (0.32 ng m–3).57 However, if BDE-209
could decompose to low brominated PBDEs at high temperature, then
OH-PBDEs (i.e., OH-BDE-47 and OH-BDE-99) would be formed by the oxidation
reaction of PBDEs, which appears to be even more toxic than PBDEs
themselves and reportedly disrupts thyroid hormone homeostasis, neurotoxicity,
sex hormone steroidogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation.58−60

3.1.3 Taizhou
TZ is a prefecture-level
city in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China. e-Waste recycling activities
have been conducted in several towns of TZ, where e-waste has been
illegally dismantled and recycled, along with an annual production
exceeding 2.2 million tons, via primitive methods (i.e., open burning
and acid picking) carried out in small-sized family workshops since
the late 1970s.27,61,62 Collected tree samples from the town of Luqiao, TZ, revealed that
BDE-209 was the most abundant homologue, accounting for 56.9–87.2%,
and the analytical results calculated by a least-square procedure
showed that the commercial decaBDE mixtures were the main source of
PBDEs in tree bark. The results from the same area in other environmental
matrices also showed the same pattern, which was revealed from sediment
and soil samples.63,64 PBDEs can be released from plastics,
which also contain BFRs in heating, because they are not chemically
bound to products. Thus, open burning of e-waste might be a significant
source of BDE-209, through which BDE-209 can be emitted into the ambient
environment in this area. In another town (Fengjiang)
of TZ, BDE-209 was detected in 27 snail samples with the highest concentration
of 45 040 ng g–1 dw.27 The same patterns were reflected in other reports on biological
samples in e-waste recycling areas.63,65,66 BDE-209 was distributed widely in snails, which indicates
that high brominated congeners could be transported to the ambient
environment and can be bioavailable in TZ as well. Fu et al. also
speculated that the usage of decaBDE in electrical equipment was the
primary source for BDE-209 in this region.27 Moreover, Shang et al. found that major PBDE congeners could be
utilized by earthworms from TZ, even if the molecular size of some
congeners such as BDE-209 is larger than 9.5 Å, which was considered
to be the maximum effective molecular cross section of organic chemicals
to penetrate biological membranes.61 These
studies have all suggested the bioavailability of BDE-209 in terrestrial
animals in e-waste recycling areas of TZ, which might cause potential
harm to the ecosystem of this region.

Furthermore, 10 kinds
of locally produced staple foods, for example, meat, fish, and eggs,
were analyzed and estimated with regard to dietary intakes of PBDEs
for inhabitants living in the areas of TZ. The study found that BDE-209
was the most abundant congener in chicken, including samples of chicken
livers and eggs, and BDE-47 was the most significant contributor in
fish.67 The median estimate of exposure
of BDE-209 in children and adults was not beyond the reference dose
(RfD) value calculated by the U.S. EPA (7000 ng kg–1 day–1).67,68 However, the principal
component analysis (PCA) revealed that food samples collected from
TZ, which is near e-waste recycling areas, are severely affected by
pollution from the activities of e-waste recycling and disposal.67 However, the metabolic process of BDE-209 is
still not clear, but BDE-209 exposure to humans and other organisms
still has a potential adverse effect on ecosystems in TZ.

3.2 Areas of DecaBDE Manufacturers
Most
of the commercial decaBDE mixtures in China are manufactured in the
areas of Laizhou Bay, Shandong Province, Bohai Sea, and Northeast
China. High abundance of BDE-209 in total PBDEs has been found in
environmental media in this area (illustrated in Figure S1). Furthermore, the levels of BDE-209 (with a median
concentration of 4.0 ng/sample) were observed around Laizhou Bay,
Shandong Province, which contributed to 31% of BDE-209, thereby indicating
that the manufacturing base is a significant source for total PBDEs
in the atmosphere of North China. This was established through gridded
field observations with passive air sampling.69 Jun et al. detected the concentrations of PBDEs in soil and sediment
near the manufacturers of decaBDE mixtures in the vicinity of Laizhou
Bay and determined that BDE-209 had the highest concentrations (ranging
from 58.2 to 7190.7 ng g–1 dw), accounting for 74.81–99.01%
of the total PBDEs.70 The concentration
of BDE-209 in the production area and its adjacent area in Shandong
Province exhibited a relatively high level and appeared to decrease
gradually toward the surroundings (Figure 3). The coefficient of correlations between
BDE-209 and the other BDE congeners (BDE-183, BDE-154, BDE-100, and
BDE-99) was negative, whereas the positive relationship with BDE-99,
BDE-153, BDE-154, and BDE-183 might be attributable to the debrominated
degradation products of BDE-209.70 Some
studies also support the assumptions that highly brominated PBDEs
in a solvent of water/methanol can be photodegradable to low brominated
congeners under natural light,6 and Gerecke
et al. posited that BDE-209 could be anaerobically degraded to low
brominated congeners in sewage sludge.71 However, the studies for the degradation of BDE-209 still require
further in-depth research. Moreover, BDE-209 is emitted into the air
via the factories; however, the air–soil conversion rate of
BDE-209 in Laizhou Bay is still not clear. Pan et al. reported that
BDE-209 ranged from 0.01 to 53 ng g–1 dw with a
mean value of 54 ng g–1 dw and from 0.66 to 12 ng
g–1 with a mean value of 5.1 ng g–1 dw in riverine and marine sediments, respectively, which are located
close to the manufacturing base of BFRs in Laizhou Bay.72 This finding also suggested the strong influence
of pollution discharges from local BDE-209 manufacturers. Pan et al.
observed that the mean concentration of BDE-209 (7 ng g–1 dw) in 44 surface sediments collected from the Bohai Sea was 1 order
of magnitude greater than those of the other congeners.73 Laizhou Bay is the location surrounded by the
Bohai Sea, which proves that the input generated by manufacturing
activities is one of the major sources of BDE-209 in this area. This
conclusion is also supported by another investigation, in which concentrations
of BDE-209 generally decreased from the coastal areas toward the outer
sea.74 In the air samples from Laizhou
Bay, the total concentrations of PBDE (range of 75–240 ng m–3 and mean of 140 ng m–3) were even
much higher than those in ambient air from e-waste dismantling areas
in southeastern China (0.900 ng m–3).75,76 BDE-209 was the dominant congener, accounting for 99.96% of the
total congeners in the air, suggesting that it was caused by the extensive
local production of BDE-209.75 In 2016,
Zhen et al. determined that Dalian Bay, which is located in the intersection
of the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, exhibited a concentration (3.94–103
ng g–1 dw) of BDE-209 as was observed in surface
sediments.77 This is likely due to the
presence of the electronics industry in Dalian city since the 1980s,
and BDE-209 could also have been transported from the manufacturing
bases in Laizhou Bay.

Figure 3 Concentration of BDE-209 in biota and abiotic media from
the areas
of decaBDE manufacturers in China.70,72,74,75,77−80,108 The corporations in the production
area (Bohai Chemical Industry Park, Yangkou town, Shouguang, Shandong
Province; N 37°07′31.3″, E 119°51′2.88″),
which manufacture commercial decaBDE mixture, include Shandong Brother
Sci. & Tech. Co. Ltd (http://www.oceanchemical.com/), Shandong Tianyi Chemicals Co.
Ltd (http://www.tychemical.com.cn/ in Chinese), and Shandong Futong Chemical Co. Ltd (http://en.futongchem.cn/).

In the BDE-209 production area,
the most abundant congener of PBDEs
in human serum from operators (36 samples) was BDE-209 (ranging from
90.2 to 4181.0 ng g–1 and 69.8% on average), and
it was also ascertained that the thyroid indexes for those operators
are abnormal compared with normal ranges (specific data can be seen
in Table S2), which raises concern of a
health risk concerning the people in production areas or those working
inside of the factories.78 He et al. discovered
that the increased BDE-209 in human serum in this region, between
2007 and 2011, might be due to the reason that penta- and octaBDE
mixtures were banned from production during this period.79 In biological samples, BDE-209 was still the
predominant congener in plants and shellfish in these areas, which
is consistent with the fact that the decaBDE mixture is the only PBDE
product in Laizhou Bay at present.80 By
combining the high concentration of BDE-209 in sediments, those sediment-dwelling
organisms might take up BDE-209 from sediments and amplify in food
webs.

All above studies confirmed that BDE-209 was dominant
in environmental
media and organisms, which indicates that the production of commercial
decaBDE products might be the primary source in Laizhou Bay including
all Bohai seas. Whether BDE-209 belongs to POPs is still undecided;
however, more concerns and regulations should be established toward
these areas.

3.3 Wastewater Treatment Plant
BDE-209
exists in various consumer products, which could be emitted during
usage and disposal and eventually transported into municipal wastewater
treatment plants (WWTPs). The concentrations of BDE-209 and nonaBDE
are found in three typical WWTPs in China, as depicted in Table S3. Manifestations of BDE-209 have been
found in conventional WWTP in Shanghai, ranging from 27.9 to 49.1%
in effluents and as high as 85.4% in dewatered sludge.81 High fractions of nonBDE were also unexpectedly
discovered from the samples of wastewater, accounting for 13.1–
30.4%, whereas only less than 10% was present in commercial PBDE products.81 This discrepancy might be explained owing to
the fact that the primary solar photodegradation products of BDE-209
appeared to be two nonaBDE congeners (BDE-206 and BDE-207) that further
debrominate to less brominated PBDE congeners.82 Gerecke et al. also confirmed that BDE-209 can debrominate
in sewage sludge under anaerobic conditions.71 Therefore, it is concluded that some of the nonaBDE might originate
from BDE-209 and nonaBDE in WWTPs, which is a significant indicator
for BDE-209. The source of BDE-209 in this WWTP was considered to
be in-house dust because of the high concentrations of PBDEs observed
in Shanghai (up to 3886.7 ng g–1) and GZ (up to
9654 ng g–1). These are two of the largest cities
in China, and BDE-209 exceeded 85%, which is comparable to the congener
patterns in the influent.83

In Hefei
city (population of 4.3 million), Anhui Province, East China, Wang
et al. investigated WWTP in the city’s oldest and largest wastewater
facility of the surrounding Chaohu Lake Basin and determined that
BDE-209 accounted for more than 90% of the total PBDEs in the wastewater,
where the BDE-209 abundance is the highest as compared with those
in Shanghai and Hong Kong (Figure S2).84 The predominant congener of BDE-209 might be
from the car dust because Hefei city boasts a great number of car
manufacturing plants that are associated with a considerable amount
of car accessories that contain BFRs, and BDE-209 was also found to
be the dominant congener in the Nanfei River.84 The car dust might be one of the most predominant sources of contaminant
in WWTP in Hefei by air transport. Wang et al. discovered an interesting
result in which the removal rate of BDE-209 is indistinctive (around
20%) during the treatment process, which might reflect the special
characteristics of the wastewater or the treatment conditions.84 However, a reasonable or distinct explanation
is still unknown. Den and Tam ascertained that isolated microalgae
(Chlorella, Parachlorella, Nitzschia palea, and Mychonastes) from WWTP exhibited a high removal rate
of BDE-209 (82–90%) with a high tolerance (spiked up to 600
μg L–1 for 7 days).85 In spite of BDE-209 being regarded as the lowest bioavailability
of PBDEs, BDE-209 can be adsorbed by microorganisms (on microalgae
cell surfaces) because of their high hydrophobicity, which leads to
the high removal of BDE-209.86 WWTPs in
Hong Kong receive both domestic and industrial wastewaters; therefore,
the congener profile in the influent indicated an enormous usage of
penta- and decaBDE commercial mixtures because the predominant congeners
were BDE-209, followed by BDE-47.87 In
WWTPs, the concentration of BDE-209 in the treated effluent was especially
lower than that in the influent, and BDE-209 and BDE-47 in fluents
switched to BDE-47 and BDE-99.87 The same
shift in the partitioning of PBDEs was also validated by Kim et al.
because of a higher water partition coefficient (Kow) of BDE-209 than that of BDE-47 and BDE-99; thus, there
is a higher rate of BDE-209 as compared to that of the solid particles.88

3.4 Urban and Rural Areas
BDE-209 appeared
to be the most abundant congener in urban areas and to have a low
abundance in rural and remote areas where the economics are relatively
undeveloped and where the utilization of products containing flame
retardants was lower. However, reports showed a very low abundance
no matter whether in urban or rural areas (Figure S3). The air (gaseous and particulate phase) in the urban areas
of GZ exhibited 100 and 150 m above the ground in the daytime and
during the night, between August and December 2010, whereas over 60%
of the particulate PBDEs was found in particles collected by an aerodynamic
diameter below 1.8 μm. Of the targeted gaseous and particulate
PBDEs, BDE-209 was the predominant congener with a percentage of 72.2
± 8.3 and 78.5 ± 6.9 among congeners by weight in the summer
and winter, respectively, indicating that BDE-209 has the tendency
to affiliate with the particles in the air, suggesting that BDE-209
has the potential of long-range transport.89 The diurnal variability of meteorological factors has also proved
to affect the dry deposition velocities of BDE-209 because the mean
daily particle dry deposition fluxes of BDE-209 ranged from 88.6 ng
m–2 day–1 in August to 122 ng
m–2 day–1 in December.89 Yang et al. utilized high-volume air samples
to collect air samples during September 2008 to August 2009 throughout
China (11 urban, 1 suburban, and 3 background/rural) and determined
that BDE-209 took up 64 ± 23% of the total 12 congeners, followed
by BDE-47 (8 ± 8%) and BDE-99 (6 ± 5%) at all urban and
suburban sites, whereas BDE-209 only accounted for 11 ± 2%.90 This diversity is likely a result of BDE-209
tending to bind to particles so that less BDE-209 migrates with the
air mass movement to the background/rural sites as compared with low
brominated PBDEs.90 The ratio of BDE-209
to the total PBDEs in both urban and background/rural sites of China
was higher than that of the air in the United States, indicating a
larger usage of commercial decaBDE mixture in China.90 Tian et al. found that the atmospheric deposition profile
in the urban areas of southern China was dominated by current-use
halogenated flame retardant (BDE-209), whereas the profile at e-waste
sites reflects that a massive amount of BDE-209 was used in the past.
Moreover, the deposition source of BDE-209 within the rural sites
was mainly attributable to the contribution of urban (45%) and e-waste
(38%) sources, which was estimated by PCA with a multiple linear regression
analysis.39 On the basis of the ratio of
vapor pressure and KOA (15.3) of BDE-209
(<1), BDE-209 might undergo degradation during transportation,
which was also supported by exceptionally high ratios of BDE-202 taken
as a marker of environmental debromination of BDE-209.39,91 This finding is consistent with other results stating that the photodegradation
of BDE-209 might occur during long-range atmospheric transport (LRAT)
on mineral aerosol, which is a significant fate process for BDE-209
in the environment.8,39 The same pattern was also validated
by Tian et al. in rural sites of southern China with 59 ± 16%
BDE-209 of total PBDEs.43 A significant
concentration of BDE-209 was observed in the atmosphere (an arithmetic
mean concentration of 478 pg m–3) in urban areas
within the city of GZ, southern China, accounting for 48 to 79% among
the total PBDEs, which was similar to the profile in Japan but much
higher than the abundance in North America and Europe.92 This implies that different PBDE formulas were
predominantly utilized in different regions. In other urban areas
of Chaohu city, BDE-209 was detected with concentrations ranging from
3.9 to 262.3 pg m–3 (58.5 pg m–3 on average), whereas significant low concentrations of BDE-209 (ranging
from 2.2 to 72 pg m–3, 15.4 pg m–3 on average) were measured in rural areas (117°27′56″
E, 31°34′55″ N) and in the town of Zhongmiao, which
is 40 km west of Chaohu city. Moreover, there were no significant
differences for most of the congeners between the urban and rural
areas in the gaseous (p = 0.0509–0.906) and
particle phases (p = 0.077–0.802) except for
BDE-209 (p = 0.002) in the particle phase, based
on the results of an independent t-test analysis,
pointing to different sources of BDE-209 in urban and rural areas.93 Zhang et al. estimated the annual dry deposition
of BDE-209 to be 1340 kg/year in southern China (within a combined
area of GZ, Dongwan, and Shunde cities), and the annual wet deposition
rates of BDE-209 were estimated to be 490 kg/year, which is an important
mode to remove BDE-209 from the atmosphere in urban areas.94 These reports mean that BDE-209 is a major potential
source in both northern and southern China; the air mass back-trajectory
analysis reflected that BDE-209 is widely distributed in urbanized
and industrialized areas in tropical Asia.95

Because of large sorption capacity, soil is an important reservoir
and sink for BDE-209 and further plays an important role in the distribution
and the biogeochemical cycling of BDE-209. The concentrations of BDE-209
in the surface soil from the Pearl River Delta, South China, ranged
from 2.38 to 66.6 ng g–1 with a mean concentration
of 13.8 ng g–1, of which a range of 25.7–102
ng g–1 registered in the point-source contaminated
soils.19 The mass inventory of BDE-209
in soil was estimated to be 44.4 t, which was comparable to that in
the sediments from the Pearl River Estuary. This suggests that surface
runoff and soil erosion are the important modes to transport BDE-209
from soils to oceans in this region.19,96 Wang et al.
discovered the highest concentrations of BDE-209 (58 445 ng
g–1 dw) in soil of the e-waste dismantling industrial
park from 65 sampling sites investigated from diverse industrial characteristics
in Zhejiang Province, South China, which are similar to the levels
measured in floor dust (5560–80 600 ng g–1 dw) from the e-waste dismantling workshop from this area.97 BDE-209 was reported to be the predominant congener
in both soil and dust in Shanghai city, whereas the contribution of
BDE-209 was much lower in dust as compared with that in soil.98 This is perhaps due to extreme hydrophobicity
of BDE-209, and it has been considered to possess low bioavailability
and tendency to bind with soil and sediment tightly.

3.5 Lakes, Rivers, and Oceans
In abiotic
media from lakes, rivers, and oceans in China, BDE-209 was the dominant
congener, whereas the fish species in fresh and sea water revealed
a very low abundance of BDE-209 (Figure S4). Air and water samples were collected from Lake Taihu, East China,
in 2004 for analyzing PBDEs, and BDE-209 was the dominant congener
in all assessed PBDE congeners, constituting 41 ± 21% on average
of the total gaseous and particulate-bound PBDEs.99 BDE-209 was measured in riverine runoff samples from major
outlets within the Pearl River Delta with concentrations varying from
0.335 to 65.2 ng L–1, which was the dominant congener
with an annual input of 1960 kg/year.100 Massive PBDEs imported to China in the form of e-waste were estimated
to be 35 000 t/year, which is higher than the annual production
of BFRs (about 10 000 t/year), and the annual riverine input
of total PBDEs from the Pearl River Delta, indicating that the main
inventory of BDE-209 might constitute accumulated imported e-wastes.100

BDE-209 was detected in river sediments
from Shanghai with a median concentration of 45.7 ng g–1 dw as the most abundant BDE congener.101 This result could be due to the increased usage of the commercial
decaBDE mixture in Shanghai, which hosts several coal-fired power
plants and municipal solid waste incinerators that might contribute
to BDE-209 in these sediments.101 Wang
et al. investigated PBDEs in water and sediment samples from Liushi
town, Zhejiang Province, South China, across different areas, in which
water samples were dominated by BDE-209, BDE-47, and BDE-153 with
BDE-209 accounting for roughly 50% of the total PBDEs, and the same
profile was also found in most sediments (up to 58 445 ng g–1 dw),97 which was similar
to those in other areas in China79,102 but much
higher than those in other freshwater sediments such as the Spanish
River, Vero (12 500 ng g–1 dw),102 and the Lake Maggiore Basin in Italy and Switzerland
(15 ng g–1 dw).103 This
might be the reason for the small dilution in the river systems in
this area.97 PBDEs were extensively investigated
by Wang et al. in samples of sediments from several major river basins
around China.104 Among these PBDEs, BDE-209
was found in all samples from the Yangtze River Basin and Pearl River
Basin with concentrations up to 61 500 ng g–1 dw in the Yangtze River Delta, whereas BDE-209 contributed to over
60% of the total PBDEs in the Yellow River Basin. This suggests that
the commercial decaBDE mixture might have been ubiquitously utilized
in most cities of China.104 The concentration
of the most abundant BDE congener in surface sediments in the Beijiang
River, Guangdong Province, South China (the concentration was up to
1558 ng g–1 dw) was much lower than that in the
Yangtze River, lower than the Zhujiang River (up to 3580 ng g–1 dw) and the Dongjiang River (up to 7340 ng g–1 dw) in the same region.105

From the coastal areas toward the outer sea, BDE-209 registered
a decreasing concentration because of the influences of anthropogenic
activities.106 BDE-209 accounted for 60.6–97.9%
(a mean value of 87.0%) of the total detected PBDEs in the Bohai Sea,
which indicated that commercial decaBDE was widely utilized within
the coastal cities of China.106 This result
was also validated by another report of BDE-209 in the sediment (75–99%)
and mussels (61–99%) in the Bohai Sea.107 The mean concentration of BDE-209 in coastal sediments
(0.68 ng g–1 dw) collected from the Yellow Sea,
North China, was lower than the level found in the Bohai Sea (2.29
ng g–1 dw), East China Sea, and Xiamen offshore
area (14.94 ng g–1 dw); it was comparable to the
level found in the Yangtze River Delta (0.41 ng g–1 dw).107−110 These high levels of BDE-209 were found around BFR manufacturing
areas, urbanized cities, and areas with numerous electrical factories.108 In all mangrove sediments in Hong Kong, the
concentrations of BDE-209 (ranged from 1.53 to 75.9 ng g–1 dw) were 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than those of other
congeners in the same sediment, and the mangrove swamps are severely
influenced by the pollution from the Pearl River Delta.111 From the coastal East China Sea, extending
about 1000 km from the Yangtze River Estuary to the south, the levels
of BDE-209 were 0.3 to 44.6 ng g–1 dw, which were
consistent with the current and historical usage of the decaBDE mixture
in China. The compositions and distribution of BDE-209 suggest that
BDE-209 in the coastal East China Sea could be primarily from coastal
waste dismantling/recycling and Yangtze River input.112 Wang et al. studied the depth profile of BDE-209 in a sediment
core P01 from the Yangtze River and revealed that the input of BDE-209
increased gradually from 1930 to 2010.113 The same profile, which was also found in the Pearl River Estuary,
South China, illustrated that the concentration of BDE-209 in sediment
cores remained until 1990 and exponentially grew afterward with a
doubling time of 2.6 ± 0.5 to 6.4 ± 1.6 years, and the inventory
of BDE-209 in sediments was 386.2 ng cm–2.96 Moreover, the flux of BDE-209 into the Pearl
River Estuary was evaluated to be 29.7 ng cm–2 year–1 and increased annually with corresponding values
in the annual industrial gross output of manufacturing electronics
in this area. This suggests that the rapid growth of the electronics
industry in the Pearl River Estuary since the early 1990s contributed
to the sharp increase in BDE-209 fluxes during the past two decades.96 This result in the Pearl River Estuary was also
determined by Mai et al. who posited that the waste discharges from
the cities adjacent to the Pearl River Estuary (such as GZ, Dongguan,
and Shenzhen) were the major sources of BDE-209.20 In addition, Chen et al. proffered that obvious elevated
sediment concentrations of BDE-209 in the rural areas of the Pearl
River Estuary were due to e-waste dismantling and that more lower
brominated PBDEs might be from the biological or photolytic debromination
of BDE-209 in the environment.114 There
is also an interesting observation that alternative BFR (decabromodiphenyl
ethane) to PBDEs has exceeded the concentrations of BDE-209, which
might also be a need for concern.114 Although
BDE-209 was considered to be input mostly by LRAT in remote areas
such as the Tibetan Plateau, Yuan et al. suggested that the small
account of the local source in the Central Tibetan Plateau is based
on the detection of BDE-209, which might be due to the sampling areas
that are in close proximity with the two biggest cities in Tibet (Lhasa
and Shigatse).115

4 Human Exposure
No direct studies of BDE-209 absorption in
humans were reported.
Human absorption was derived from the measurements of BDE-209 in human
biological media after anthropogenic exposure. PBDEs, such as BDE-209,
are capable of accumulating in tissues of organisms and are magnified
via the food chain, and then they finally pose adverse effects on
human health. BDE-209 in marine sediments represents an exposure path
to fish, and the consumption of fish is a significant exposure pathway
for humans.113 Wang et al. estimated the
potential cancer risk of human exposure at a 95% confidence level
to BDE-209. The cancer risk was estimated based on the following equations    where HI represents noncancer risk, DIi represents the daily intake of congener i by consumption of fish (mg kg–1 day–1), RFDi is the reference
dose of congener i (mg kg–1 day–1), and CSFi is the cancer
slope factor of congener i (mg day kg–1). For BDE-209, CSFi is 0.0007 m day
kg–1116 and RFDi is 0.007 mg kg–1 day–1.117

However, the concentrations
of BDE-209 in fish and sediments were
3.09 × 10–7, 1.67 × 10–7, and 8.86 × 10–7 for children, teens, and
adults, respectively, which are significantly lower than the level
of the threshold (10–6); the calculation of the
hazard index for noncancer risk was also much less than 1 for the
three groups, suggesting a no-cancer risk.113 This result was also proven by Man et al. who employed the same
method to calculate the cancer risk values of soils, based on the
total concentration of BDE-209 from six sites of agricultural soils
from Hong Kong, which were below 1 in a million people at 5th, 50th,
and 95th centiles.118 Because of the continuous
use of the commercial decaBDE mixtures, it is expected that the levels
of BDE-209 will still be found in human samples.37

4.1 Inhalation Exposure
Inhalation or
ingestion of indoor dust has been identified to be the main pathway
of PBDE exposure for people, especially children.119 Settled workplace dust collected from several places (e.g.,
shopping malls, hospitals, and electronic factories) and home dust
in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and GZ around the Pearl River Delta were measured
for PBDEs with the highest levels (2122–40 236 ng g–1), dust from homes ranged from 685 to 18 385
ng g–1, and the predominant congener was BDE-209
in both workplace dust and home dust, which is the same level as the
outdoor dust from Shanghai.32,33 There were no significant
correlations found between the concentrations of BDE-209 and the number
of electronic appliances (p > 0.05), and the decaBDE
mixture is likely to undergo photolytic degradation owing to the ratio
of BDE-209/(BDE-207 + BDE-206) of the workplace dust samples, which
revealed a range from 12 to 30.32 Wang
et al. found the most significant contributor to PBDEs in household
dust sampled from GZ and Hong Kong (PM2.5 and TSP) where
PM2.5 contained the highest BDE-209.120 Wang et al. considered that dust ingestion was the predominant
PBDE exposure pathway for toddlers, whereas no exposure route for
BDE-209 exposure was provided.120 The median
hazard quotient of dust ingestion in China (samples collected from
23 provinces across China) for BDE-209 observed for infants, toddlers,
children, teenagers, and adults ranged from 2.51 × 10–6 to 7.83 × 10–4, which is far less than 1,
which suggests a low risk to humans.33 However,
the maximum hazard quotient of BDE-209 was observed with the value
of 0.73 for toddlers, which was close to 1.33 In southern China, Ding et al. observed positive correlations between
the indoor and outdoor dust samples for BDE-209, suggesting the exchange
of BDE-209 between the two compartments.121 Ni et al. observed that the ingestion of dust and soil constituted
the major exposure routes for BDE-209, whereas contribution of other
congeners (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154, and
BDE-183) could be ignored.116 For instance,
BDE-209 contributed to more than 90% of the total PBDEs’ daily
intake via soil ingestion or indoor dust exposure, and they also thought
that indoor dust should not always be the most important exposure
route for PBDEs.116

4.2 Dietary
Exposure
BDE-209 was not
always considered to be bioavailable because of its high molecular
weight; therefore, the premise arose that it is not harmful to organisms
and humans.122 However, the occurrence
of BDE-209 was discovered in several organisms, that is, roaches,
gray seals, sharks, and so forth.122−124 In southern China,
the area with the heaviest PBDE contamination, the presence of BDE-209
in several seafood products (shrimp, crab, and shellfish) was found
in 44.4% of the total samples, which suggested that BDE-209 appears
to be more bioavailable than previously thought.65 In this study, BDE-209 levels ranged from nd (not detected)
to 3.21 ng g–1 dw, which were lower than those from
South Korea (0.23–14.8 ng g–1 dw), Hong Kong
(0–14.3 ng g–1 dw), and the Netherlands (4.9
ng g–1 dw).63,65,125−127 Wu et al. (2008) found PBDE congener profiles
in rice frogs (Rana limnocharis), in
which BDE-209 only constituted 2–14%, with BDE-99 and BDE-153
being the largest contributors, which were different from those in
organisms from aquatic (predominance of BDE-47) and terrestrial sources
(predominance of BDE-209).128 This is attributed
to the feeding habits of frog, which combine aquatic and terrestrial
circumstances. A relatively lower BDE-154 (5–9%) was also observed.128 Wu et al. suggested that BDE-154 might be from
the biotransformation of BDE-209, which is also consistent with other
reports that BDE-154 is a metabolic product of BDE-209 in fish.128−130 In July 2016, Su et al. detected PBDEs from selected food items,
including seven aquatic foods (Mandarin fish, catfish, Chinese snakehead,
Black bass, crucian carp, and white Amur bream), purchased from different
markets in Nanjing city, South China, and BDE-209 was not detected
in fish or other food.131 This observation
could be due to the fact that lesser brominated BDEs are more easily
accumulated than high brominated congeners, which also have higher
molecular weights. In addition, BDEs with higher molecular weights,
such as BDE-209, are more easily biotransformed than those with lower
molecular weights. Those biotransformed lower brominated congeners
might form MeO-PBDEs and OH-PBDEs that are more likely to cause adverse
effects, because analogues of PBDEs exhibited dioxin-like potency
such as 6-OH-BDE-47 and 6-MeO-BDE-47, which have been quantified in
various environment media and marine organisms.132 Ni et al. also estimated that the cancer risk for BDE-209
exposure in adults ranged from 5.8 × 10–23 to
5.5 × 10–21 (far less than 1) and that hazard
quotients for BDE-209 were 1.2 × 10–5, which
was based on the daily intake from food consumption in Shenzhen, China,
which suggested that the low deleterious risk regarding BDE-209 and
BDE-209 exposure via food is very low for adults.116

Duck eggs, as a common dietary component, were collected
from TZ city, which has many e-waste recycling sites in eastern China
and in the majority of samples (duck yolk), and BDE-209 was the most
abundant congener (62%), with a mean concentration of 500 ng g–1 lipid weight (lw), and it was also detected in feed
samples (0.19–5.12 ng g–1 dw) from the printed
circuit board’s recycling location.133 Exposure estimates for duck eggs did not exceed the reference values
by the U.S. EPA, though BDE-209 was not estimated.133

4.3 Burdens of the Human Body
BDE-209
was suspected to be low in human serum because of the short half-life
of 15 days or being less bioaccumulative because it exhibits the largest
molecular size and the highest octanol–water partition coefficient
of the total PBDEs.134,135 However, Wang et al. found that
BDE-209 was the most abundant congener in all serum samples by weight,
which accounted for 40–68% of the total PBDEs. These were collected
from Zhejiang Province, South China, through blood samples from 194
Chinese injection workers from electrical appliance factories and
205 catering workers, leather factory workers, infertile men, and
umbilical cords. The injection workers apparently showed higher concentrations
of BDE-209 than others without obvious PBDE exposure.36 This finding was consistent with another report regarding
the Chinese resident population, indicating that the population in
China are continuously exposed to high levels of BDE-209 in blood
serums because of its short half-time (fast turnover rate).136 However, another study depicts a different
pattern, where BDE-209 was detected at relatively low concentrations
in all samples taken from umbilical cord blood from South China. Some
levels of BDE-197 detected were due to the debromination of BDE-209,
as was also found in human bodies and laboratory studies.35,37,137,138

Moreover, breast milk has been taken for a biomarker to evaluate
the extent of human exposure to PBDEs in the studies of numerous countries,
which is of significant concern, as contamination is passed on to
the next generation.34,35 BDE-209 was reported in breast
milk from the United States and Spain, which varied from 0.1 to 48%.139,140 In China, BDE-209 was not the dominant BDE congener in breast milk,
and few studies reported the detection of BDE-209 in breast milk.17 However, a Chinese study showed that BDE-28,
BDE-153, and BDE-183 were predominant components in human breast milk
from mothers because of the high exposure rate in the decaBDE production
areas, suggesting that high decaBDE exposure might lead to increasing
levels of low brominated BDEs in the human body.136 Therefore, more research regarding BDE-209 congeners in
human breast milk should be conducted in further studies.

5 Future Recommendations
On a regional scale, the levels
of BDE-209 in the environment of
China are relatively high as the predominant congener among other
congeners. Although more safe nonhalogen flame retardant has appeared
in the market, BDE-209 will be still mainly used based on its much
cheaper price. Because the proposal for BDE-209 listed to POPs was
submitted to POPs Review Committee, Stockholm Convention in 2013,
now BDE-209 is under the review for Annex A.3 BDE-209 still needs continuous attention in the next few decades,
especially because pentaBDE was banned in 2004 and octaBDE was banned
from China and was never produced in China. However, China continued
to accept e-wastes from other countries, and thus, more and more e-waste
containing BDE-209 will continue to be generated. Therefore, BDE-209
in several e-waste recycling areas still needs to be continually monitored,
especially for the operators and residents living in the region. Eco-friendly
approaches such as feedstock recycling, mechanical recycling, and
bromine recovery should also be utilized for e-wastes so as to reduce
the emission of BDE-209. In addition, BDE-209 emission occurs in the
life of products impregnated with this flame retardant or at the ultimate
disposal stage. The emissions from product life cycles vary over the
life cycle of products, which cannot be accurately monitored. Thus,
regulatory measures regarding the management of BDE-209, such as monitoring
and production control, are urgently made in China.

The high
occurrence of BDE-209 in several different recycling areas
has caused a potential exposure risk for organisms and humans. High
concentrations of BDE-209 emitted from the manufacturing areas to
the surrounding environments continue to grow at an alarming rate.
However, commercial decaBDE mixtures are not presently controlled
by any regulations. There is an urgent need for further consideration
and studies regarding regulations, policies, and standards with respect
to the usage and production of decaBDE mixtures. Although a considerable
amount of information is available on PBDEs, it is somewhat difficult
to draw a clear conclusion regarding BDE-209 exposure in humans because
BDE-209 was not detected in many studies. However, the consumers of
fish and duck eggs were heavily exposed to BDE-209. Studies on breast
milk and blood from individuals residing or working in e-waste recycling
areas (QY, GY, and TZ) and Laizhou Bay revealed a high level of BDE-209
when compared to other areas. Home dust is also a primary inhalation
exposure of BDE-209 to adults. The current exposure estimates of BDE-209
from different areas in China are below the RFDs of the U.S. EPA,
and the cancer risk is below 1. However, the high levels of BDE-209
in workers in e-waste sites and the decaBDE mixtures sites should
encourage more research to be conducted, with an overall and accurate
risk assessment of BDE-209 for laws and regulations of use and production
for decaBDE mixture in China.
