A precise
determination method of azilsartan solubility between
293.15 and 333.15 K in several ordinary solvents and some of their
aqueous mixtures was established by high-performance liquid chromatography.
In all tested solvents, its solubility shows exponential growth with
the increase in temperature. This trend is especially pronounced in
methanol and ethanol. The order of solubility of azilsartan can be
expressed as ethanol > tetrahydrofuran > ethanol/water (8/2,
v/v)
> methanol > methanol/water (8/2, v/v) > n-propanol
> isopropanol > ethanol/Water (5/5, v/v) > acetonitrile.
The solubility
data of azilsartan were well correlated by the λh model. Moreover, the thermodynamic data including the dissolving
enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy of azilsartan in each solvent
were calculated which is crucial to its preparation technology study.

1 Introduction
Azilsartan
(2-ethoxy-1-([2′-(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl)-1H-benzimidazole-7-carboxylic acid) (Figure 1), as a hypotensive drug, is a novel angiotensin
II receptor antagonist that competitively blocks the binding of angiotensin
to the AT1 receptor.1,2 It was first synthesized in 1995
by Kohara and approved for sale in Japan in 2012.3 Because of its high efficiency and less adverse effects
such as dry cough compared to the similar products, azilsartan is
widely applied clinically4−7 in recent years. It is reported that there are four
kinds of crystalline forms of this chemical,8−10 and the crystal
form, size distribution, and polymorphism could influence its pharmaceutical
quality and effectiveness.11 Despite sufficient
studies on its polymorph,12 the solubility
information of this drug has been ignored. Indeed, multiple solvents
were applied in its crystallization and recrystallization process
such as isopropanol, dimethylformamide, methanol, and acetonitrile.
In addition, ethanol was used as the washing solvent in the synthesis
process of azilsartan to achieve the desired purity.13,14

structure of azilsartan.

It is known that the
choice of the solvent and its dissolving capacity
have a huge impact on the drug manufacturing process efficiency.15 Technically, the solubility information of drugs
is essential in all steps of drug discovery and development processes
such as crystallization, separation, liquid extraction, and drug formulation.

In this study, the solubility of azilsartan in methanol, ethanol,
acetonitrile, n-propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran,
methanol/water (8/2, v/v), ethanol/water (8/2, v/v), and ethanol/water
(5/5, v/v) was obtained based on the chromatographic method. The thermodynamic
parameters, such as dissolved enthalpy, were calculated according
to the van’t Hoff equation.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 High-Performance Liquid
Chromatography
The purity of azilsartan was 99.84% determined
by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with the optimized condition (Figure 2).

Figure 2 HPLC chromatogram of
azilsartan. Inset: linear relationship between
the chromatogram peak area (Y) and the concentration
(X) of azilsartan in methanol.

A calibration curve for the concentration of azilsartan was prepared
by using a standard solution which was prepared from 1.357 ×
10–3 to 1.357 × 10–1 mg·mL–1 in methanol. All experiments were repeated three
times at each temperature. The peak area was considered the average
measured by HPLC. The calibration curve was obtained based on the
chromatogram (Figure 2).

The linear equation between the mass concentration and the
peak
area of azilsartan sample solution is Y = 330.2X – 0.3387, while correlation coefficient R2 = 0.9998. The linearity range is from 4.1
× 10–4 to 1.4 × 10–1 mg·mL–1.

2.2 Correlation
Data of Azilsartan
The
melting point of azilsartan was obtained by the differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) study shown in Figure 3. The abscissa and ordinate of the graph
is the absolute temperature and the heat flow, respectively. It can
be observed that the melting point of this solute is 463.28 K, and
the melting enthalpy is 137.23 J/g.

Figure 3 The DSC curve of azilsartan.

The solubility of azilsartan in the calibration curve is
expressed
by the mass concentration detected by HPLC. The mole fraction of the
solute can be calculated by eq 1. 1  wherein xA is
the mole fraction of the solute azilsartan; m0 is the mass of the solution; mA is the mass of the solute; MA is the
molar mass of the solute azilsartan; and MB is the molar mass of the solvent. At 95% confidence level, the experimental
measurement uncertainty is approximately 5.0%.

The solid–liquid
equilibrium was described by the λh model which
is one of the thermodynamic models proposed
by Buchowski et al.,16 presented as eq 2. 2  Here, x is the mole fraction
of the solute; T is the experimental temperature
corresponding to x; Tm is the melting point of the solute; λ and h are the parameters of the equation.

In order to verify the
uncertainty of the data, the relative deviation
(δ) was introduced according to eq 3. Moreover, the deviation between xAcalc and xA was estimated by mean deviation (MD), measuring
the correlation degree of the mathematical model. 3  where xA is the
mole fraction of solute azilsartan; xAcalc can be calculated
from eq 2. 4  here N is the number
of experimental
data; xA and xAcalc are the experimental
and calculated values of solubility, respectively.

The solubility
data of azilsartan in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, n-propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, and mixed solvents
in the temperature range from 293.15 to 333.15 K are listed in Table 1 and graphically presented
in Figure 4.

a Standard uncertainties u are u(T) = 0.1 K, u(p) = 0.05 MPa, and related standard uncertainty ur(x) = 0.05 (0.95 level of
confidence).

The data of
molar fraction (xA) of
the solubility are close to the theoretical molar fraction xAcalc, indicating that the solubility experimental data have good reliability
and particularly instructive.

The equation parameters, the determination
coefficient R2, and the MD values obtained
by fitting with
the λh model are listed in Table 2.

Table 2 Parameters
of λh Model in Different Solvents
solvent	λ	h	R2	MD	
methanol	36.07	89.05	0.9927	1.596	
ethanol	37.35	88.90	0.9848	1.568	
acetonitrile	3.365	991.2	0.9998	6.077	
n-propanol	36.22	124.5	0.9789	6.029

ethanol/water (8/2, v/v)	39.00	93.40	0.9950	1.843	
ethanol/water (5/5, v/v)	17.93	287.6	0.9524	10.98	
This shows that the λh model
fitted the
data well because the value of determination coefficient R2 was between 0.9524 and 0.9998, while the value of MD
was between 1.218 and 10.98. Besides the λh model, polynomial empirical equation, Apelblat model, and Wilson
model were also used to correlate the solubility of azilsartan. However,
when the polynomial empirical equation was used for fitting, the calculated
solubility was significantly different from the experimental value.
Moreover, when the Apelblat model and the Wilson model were used for
fitting, the determination coefficient R2 is negative, which means the fitting cannot converge.

The
solid phase of azilsartan in equilibrium with the saturated
solutions was also characterized by X-ray powder diffraction analysis,
and significant differences were observed among the diffraction patterns.
According to the characteristic diffraction peak, three kinds of crystalline
forms were definitely distinguished. Six strong diffraction peaks
between 9.183°–23.808° were observed in the X-ray
powder diffractograms obtained in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, n-propanol, methanol/water (8/2, v/v), ethanol/water (8/2,
v/v), and ethanol/water (5/5, v/v), which was defined as crystalline
form I, while 10 strong diffraction peaks together with the characteristic
diffraction peak at 2θ = 7.834° in isopropanol as crystalline
form II and seven strong diffraction peaks together with the characteristic
diffraction peak at 2θ = 22.420° in tetrahydrofuran as
crystalline form III (Supporting Information).

2.3 Thermodynamic Properties for Azilsartan Dissolution
In order to have an insight into the azilsartan dissolve process
in each solvents, the Gibbs energy (ΔsolG°), the dissolving enthalpy (ΔsolH°), and the dissolving entropy (ΔsolS°) were further studied.

The chemical potential
of the solute azilsartan in the solid and liquid phases is equivalent
when the dissolution equilibrium is achieved.17 It can be expressed as eq 5. 5  here, μΑ° is
the chemical potential of solute
azilsartan when the atmospheric pressure is 0.1 MPa; αΑ is the activity of the real solution, which is defined as αΑ = γΑxΑ; γA is the activity coefficient of the solute;
and xA is the mole fraction of solute
azilsartan.

Therefore, the relationship between the mole fraction
of solute
azilsartan xA and the Gibbs free energy
change in the dissolution process was established when the two phases
reached equilibrium at any certain temperature (T) as eq 6. 6  where ΔsolGΑ°(T) is the Gibbs energy of dissolution of the solute
azilsartan at temperature T.

Generally, the
Gibbs energy of dissolution at temperature T is given
by eq 7. 7  

Therefore,
the mole fraction of solute azilsartan xA can be associated with the changes of entropy and enthalpy
in the dissolution process as eq 8. 8  

The activity coefficient (γA) goes to 1 when the
mole fraction of the solute (xA) goes
to zero in an ideal dilute solution. Equation 8 was simplified as eq 9. Moreover, the relative contributions of
enthalpy % ζH and entropy % ζTS in
the dissolution process were introduced to measure the contribution
of enthalpy and entropy to the change of the Gibbs free energy during
the dissolution process, as eq 10 and 11. 9   10   11  

The dissolving thermodynamic data of azilsartan obtained are
shown
in Table 3.

in Different Solvents

ethanol/water (5/5, v/v)	34.8772	90.548	6.580	55.208	44.792	
The
dissolution of azilsartan in the selected solvents was an endothermic
and entropic increase process. In the aqueous solution, the heat absorption
and entropy increased with the increase in the water ratio during
the dissolution process.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, the liquid chromatographic method was introduced
to measure the solubility of azilsartan in methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, n-propanol, isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, methanol/water
(8/2, v/v), ethanol/water (8/2, v/v), and ethanol/water (5/5, v/v).
In the single organic solvents, the molar fraction of azilsartan in
methanol, ethanol, and tetrahydrofuran is much greater than it in
acetonitrile, n-propanol, and isopropanol. In the
mixed solvents, azilsartan has the highest solubility in ethanol/water
(8/2, v/v) aqueous solutions. Moreover, its solubility decreased when
the proportion of water in the mixed solvents increased. The solubility
of azilsartan in nine solvents definitely increases with the increasing
temperature, and the largest solubility change happened in methanol
and ethanol, which could provide the theoretical basis in its recrystallization
process.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Azilsartan used in this
work was provided by Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Methanol,
ethanol, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran (chromatographic grade)
were purchased from the Beijing Bellingway Technology Co., Ltd. without
further purification. n-Propanol and isopropanol
were obtained from Beijing Guangtong Fine Chemical Company without
further processing. Deionized water (18.25 MΩ·cm–1) was obtained from a Millipore Mili-Q Plus water system. All solution
was filtered through 0.22 μm membranes before use.

4.2 Liquid Chromatographic Conditions
The purity and content
analysis of azilsartan were performed on an
UltiMate 3000 HPLC and UHPLC system (America). The stationary and
mobile phase were TechMate C18 ST-II (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm,
100 Å) and acetonitrile/water (57/43, v/v, 1 wt % glacial acetic
acid), respectively. The detection wavelength was 251 nm; the flow
rate was 1.0 mL·min–1; and the injection volume
was 10 μL.

4.3 Measurement of Azilsartan
Solubility
An excess of azilsartan was taken in a glass vial
and mixed with
10 mL of methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, n-propanol,
isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, methanol/water (8/2, v/v), ethanol/water
(8/2, v/v), and ethanol/water (5/5, v/v) to get a supersaturated solutions,
respectively. Sequentially, the vial was incubated in temperature
thermostatic water bath stirring at 293.15, 303.15, 313.15, 323.15,
and 333.15 K for 12 h until the dissolution equilibrium was obtained,
respectively. The temperature was determined by a pure solvent bottle
with a thermometer inside. The uncertainty of the temperature was
±0.1 K. After another 12 h standing at the corresponding temperature,18,19 aliquots of 1.0 mL of supernatant of each vial was withdrawn by
a syringe with a 0.22 μm membrane. The solution was transferred
to a dried, weighed double dish, and the dish was weighed quickly
to determine the mass of the solution (m0) with an uncertainty of ±0.1 mg. After the solution was completely
dried under nitrogen, the residue was dissolved in methanol and exactly
diluted to 10 mL. Then 10 μL of the reconstituted samples was
taken for HPLC analysis. All of the experiments were carried out three
times simultaneously and analyzed by HPLC.

Meanwhile, the solid
phase in the equilibrium with the saturated solutions was characterized
by the X-ray powder diffraction at 296(2) K under Moka ray (λ
= 0.71073 Å) and ω-scanning method.
