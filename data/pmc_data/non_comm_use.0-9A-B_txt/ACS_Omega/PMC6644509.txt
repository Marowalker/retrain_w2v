We report new dual acidic pH/reduction-responsive
degradable amphiphilic
block copolymers featured with dual acidic pH-labile acetal linkage
and a reductively-cleavable disulfide bond at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
block junction as well as pendant disulfide bonds in the hydrophobic
block. Centered on the use of a macroinitiator approach, three strategies
utilize the combination of atom transfer radical polymerization and
reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization in
a sequential or concurrent mechanism, along with facile coupling reactions.
Combined structural analysis with dual-stimuli-responsive degradation
investigation allows better understanding of the architectures and
orthogonalities of the formed block copolymers as a diblock or a triblock
copolymer. Our study presents the development of effective synthetic
strategies to well-defined multifunctional amphiphilic block copolymers
that exhibit dual-stimuli-responsive degradation at dual location
(called the DL-DSRD strategy), thus potentially promising as nanoassemblies
for effective drug delivery.

Introduction
Block copolymers consist
of two or more covalently linked blocks,
each characterized with different properties such as polarity. Of
particular interest is an amphiphilic block copolymer (ABP) designed
with hydrophilic (or water-soluble) and hydrophobic blocks. Because
of the amphiphilicity, well-defined ABPs are capable of self-assembly
to form nanoassemblies and nanostructured materials in aqueous solutions
and films.1−4 Further to the amphiphilic nature, an introduction of additional
functionalities into the design of ABP-based nanoassemblies offers
versatility and multifunctionality toward various applications in
pharmaceutical and materials science.5−10 Particularly, stimuli-responsive degradation (SRD) utilizes unique
dynamic covalent chemistry with labile linkages that can be cleaved
in response to external stimuli (or triggers).11,12 Acidic pH, light, and ultrasound as well as reductive, oxidative,
and enzymatic reactions are typical stimuli that have been extensively
explored. The stimuli-responsive cleavage of the dynamic linkages
causes the degradation of ABPs and their nanoassemblies, and thus,
changes their physical, chemical, and spectroscopic properties.13−20 These unique properties have prompted stimuli-responsive degradable
ABPs to be useful as effective building blocks in constructing multifunctional
nanoassemblies, not only as drug delivery nanocarriers,21−26 but also as biosensors, smart films, and surfaces.27−31

Numerous approaches have been explored to develop stimuli-responsive
degradable ABPs and their nanoassemblies. Most of the approaches can
be classified with the numbers and locations of stimuli-responsive
cleavable linkages. Early approaches involve the incorporation of
single-type cleavable linkages into one location of ABPs, namely as
in the backbone, in the pendant chain of hydrophobic blocks, or at
the junction of hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks.32,33 This single location strategy creates single-stimulus-responsive
nanoassemblies with the cleavable linkages located either in the micelle
cores or at core/corona interfaces. Furthermore, the incorporation
of multiple distinct stimulus-responsive linkages has been explored
for the synthesis of dual or multistimuli-responsive degradable nanoassemblies
that can be triggered by two or more stimuli. However, most systems
have been designed with the concept of a single location strategy;
thus dual or multiple linkages are positioned predominantly in hydrophobic
blocks.34−36 A few sheddable systems have also been synthesized
with dual cleavable linkages at block junctions by coupling reactions.
Typical examples include a combination of acetal/o-nitrobenzyl (acid/light),37 disulfide/o-nitrobenzyl (reduction/light),38,39 and disulfide/thioketal (reduction/oxidation).40 Further to the design through the single location strategy,
most approaches to synthesize sheddable micelles present drawbacks
including low coupling efficiency and difficulty in the purification
of homopolymers from targeted ABPs.41

Recently, the development of a new strategy has allowed the synthesis
of robust ABPs and their nanoassemblies with single disulfide or dual
cleavable linkages positioned at dual locations (core, interlayer,
and core/corona interface).42−45 This dual location dual-stimuli-responsive degradation
(referred to as DL-DSRD) strategy could offer versatility in that
dual-stimuli responses to each stimulus can independently and precisely
regulate the release of encapsulated biomolecules at dual locations,
as both the micellar core and the core/corona interface.46 Given the promising features, several DL-DSRD-exhibiting
ABPs have been synthesized, particularly for endogenous and exogeneous
responses to dual-stimuli including acidic pH/reduction,47 reduction/acidic pH,48−50 and light/reduction51,52 at dual locations (micellar core/interface). Despite these advances,
most of the DL-DSRD ABPs present the block junctions with single-stimulus-responsive
linkages. Developing novel DL-DSRD ABPs designed with dual-stimuli-responsive
degradable block junctions (i.e., core/corona interfaces of nanoassemblies)
is highly demanded.

Atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)
and reversible addition
fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization have been viewed
as the most successful controlled radical polymerization (CRP) techniques.53,54 They enable the synthesis of well-defined block copolymers including
SRD-exhibiting ABPs with predetermined molecular weight and narrow
molecular weight distribution.55,56 In addition to the
utilization of the single CRP technique, the combination of two distinct
CRP techniques is a highly appealing approach to synthesize the arrays
of multifunctional ABPs.57−59 Furthermore, the interplay of
ATRP and RAFT polymerization in the presence of RAFT mediators such
as dithioesters, dithiocarbamates, and trithiocarbonates allow the
synthesis of orthogonal polymers.60−63 As such, the rational selection
of the synthetic pathways can allow the control over morphology, architecture,
orthogonality, and functionality of the resulting ABPs.

Herein,
we report facile strategies to synthesize new DL-DSRD-exhibiting
ABPs designed with the dual acidic pH-labile acetal linkage and reductively-cleavable
disulfide bond at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic block junction as well
as pendant disulfide bonds in the hydrophobic block. The block copolymers
consist of a hydrophilic poly(oligo(ethylene oxide) monomethyl ether
methacrylate) (POEOMA) block and a hydrophobic polymethacrylate block
having multiple disulfide pendants (PHMssEt). As a consequence, the
copolymer could form nanoassemblies exhibiting dual acidic pH/reduction
responses at interfaces and single reduction response in micellar
cores, thus attaining DSRD at dual locations. Our synthetic pathways
center on the use of a new hetero-functional bromine initiator labeled
with both acetal and disulfide groups (A2 in Scheme 1). By employing a novel macroinitiator approach,
three strategies utilizing a combination of ATRP and RAFT polymerization
by their sequential or concurrent (or interplay) mechanism were established.
Dual acidic pH/reduction-responsive degradation was systematically
investigated to understand not only site-specific responses but also
the architectures and orthogonalities of the formed block copolymers
as diblock or triblock copolymers.

(A2)
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of the Br–AC–SS–OH Initiator
(A2)
Three different strategies that have been explored in
this work, focusing on the synthesis of a novel A2 initiator functionalized
with an acetal, a disulfide, a hydroxyl, and a bromine group. Scheme 1 depicts its synthetic
approach in two steps. The first step was the esterification of ethylene
glycol vinyl ether with bromoisobutyryl bromide (Br-iBuBr) in the
presence of triethylamine (Et3N, base) as described elsewhere.64 This step enabled the synthesis of A1 at as
high as 90% yield. The second step was the coupling reaction of the
purified A1 with 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide in the presence of pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS). A 1:1 mole equivalent ratio of
A1 to 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide was designed to minimize the formation
of a dibromide side product and facilitate the isolation of A2 from
unreacted 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide. The product (A2) was purified
by column chromatography at 42% yield. The structures of A1 and A2
were confirmed by NMR spectroscopy analysis: 1H (Figure 1), 13C
(Figures S1 and S2), and COSY (Figure S3) NMR spectra.

of A1 (a) and A2 (b) in CDCl3.

Strategies I and II to Synthesize Diblock Copolymers
Given
the successful synthesis and characterization of A2 as an ATRP
initiator, two strategies were explored to synthesize well-controlled
diblock copolymers that consist of POEOMA and PHMssEt blocks. As illustrated
in Schemes 2 and 3, they differ with the utilization
of both ATRP and RAFT polymerization techniques for strategy I and
only ATRP for strategy II. To achieve this multifunctional/orthogonal
block copolymers, the strategies require employing facile coupling
reactions to convert the P1 precursor to either a macroRAFT agent
or an ATRP macroinitiator.

Synthesis of P1 and Investigation of ATRP Kinetics
The first
step for both strategies I and II is the ATRP of OEOMA
in the presence of A2 initiator to synthesize a well-controlled POEOMA–AC–SS–OH
(P1) homopolymer (here, AC: acetal and SS: disulfide). Here, activators
regenerated by electron transfer process for ATRP was employed since
the process is facile and robust as well as allows for a 2–3
orders of magnitude reduction on the amount of the mediator required
down to ∼102 ppm levels.65,66 The initial mole ratio of [OEOMA]o/[A2]o can
be defined as the degree of polymerization (DP) of POEOMA when monomer
conversion is complete. Here, the ratio was varied with 20:1, 50:1,
and 100:1 (P1-20, P1-50, and P1-100, respectively) under similar conditions
for ATRP. To investigate their kinetics, aliquots were taken periodically
during polymerization to determine monomer conversion by 1H NMR and molecular weight and dispersity by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC). As seen in Figure 2a, all three polymerizations were first order, indicating
a constant concentration of active centers during polymerizations.
Polymerization was faster in the order of [OEOMA]o/[A2]o = 20:1 > 50:1 > 100:1, which is consistent with the
increasing
order of the A2 initiator concentration. Note that the rate of ATRP
is proportional to the concentration of the ATRP initiator. As can
be seen in Figure 2b, the molecular weight increased monotonically with conversion,
and dispersity (Đ) remained as low as Mw/Mn < 1.2 up to 65% monomer
conversion. GPC traces evolved to a high molecular weight region over
time (Figure S4). Molecular weights of
P1 homopolymers determined by GPC appeared to deviate from theoretically
calculated ones over conversions. Such difference is due to the different
hydrodynamic volume of POEOMA from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
standards.

Figure 2 First-order kinetics plot over time (a) and evolution of molecular
weight and molecular weight distribution over conversion (b) for ATRP
of OEOMA in the presence of the A2 initiator, with various initial
mole ratios of [OEOMA]o/[A2]o = 20:1, 50:1,
and 100:1. The straight lines in (b) are theoretically calculated Mn values at conversion. Conditions for ATRP:
[A2]o/[Cu(II)Br2]o/[TPMA]o/[Sn(II)EH2]o = 1:0.05:0.15:0.4 in anisole
at 40 °C, OEOMA/anisole = 0.23 w/w.

These results with first-order kinetics, linear increase
of molecular
weight, and narrow dispersity over conversion suggest that the ATRP
of OEOMA in the presence of A2 is well-controlled, enabling the synthesis
of well-defined P1 polymers with various DPs and narrow molecular
weight distributions.

The formed polymers were purified by passing
through a basic aluminum
oxide column to remove Cu and tin species, followed by precipitation
from hexane to remove unreacted OEOMA monomers. As seen in Figure 3a, 1H
NMR spectrum of the purified P1-20, as an example, shows the peaks
at 4.8 ppm (e) corresponding to a methine proton of the acetal group,
2.9 ppm (f and g) corresponding to four methylene protons adjacent
to disulfide linkage, and 0.8–1.1 ppm (a) corresponding to
the backbone methyl protons. Their integral ratio allows the determination
of the DP of the POEOMA block to be 14 for P1-20. GPC analysis indicates
that the purified P1-20 had Mn = 6.7 kg/mol
and Mw/Mn =
1.14 (Figure S5). Other two P1 polymers
(P1-50 and P1-100) were also characterized in similar ways and the
results are summarized in Table 1. Note that the DPs of POEOMA blocks determined by 1H NMR analysis are close to the theoretically calculated values.

Strategy
I (ATRP–RAFT)
Given the synthesis of
well-defined P1-20 by ATRP, the next step for strategy I, as illustrated
in Scheme 2, is the
EDC-mediated coupling reaction to synthesize P2, a POEOMA-based macroRAFT
agent (EDC: 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-HCl salt).
The terminal hydroxyl (OH) group of P1-20 reacted with the carboxylic
acid of 4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoic acid (CPTP, a
RAFT agent) in the presence of Et3N as the catalyst. The
product was precipitated from a mixture of hexane/diethyl ether to
remove excess CPTP from P2. 1H NMR in Figure 3b shows the appearance of the
new peaks at 7.3–7.9 ppm (h) corresponding to aromatic protons
in CPTP moieties. Combined with a change in color from white to pink,
the 1H NMR analysis suggests the successful conjugation
of CPTP to P1. Then, the purified P2 was used as a macroagent for
RAFT polymerization of HMssEt, initiated with 2,2′-azodi(2-methylbutyronitrile)
(AMBN, an azo-type initiator) to synthesize POEOMA–AC–SS–PHMssEt
block copolymer (P3). With the initial mole ratio of [HMssEt]o/[P2 macroRAFT agent]o = 50/1 in anisole at 70
°C, the polymerization was stopped at 79% monomer conversion.
After being purified by precipitation from hexane, the product was
analyzed by 1H NMR and GPC. 1H NMR of P3 in Figure 3c shows the presence
of pendant methylene groups adjacent to disulfide linkages at 2.9
ppm (l,m) and the pendant OEO moieties at 3.4–3.7 ppm (EO).
Using the integral ratio of the peaks (c, p) with the DP of the POEOMA
block = 14, the DP of PHMssEt block was determined to be 48. GPC analysis
indicates that the GPC trace evolved to a high molecular weight region,
with Mn = 14.0 kg/mol and Mw/Mn = 1.24 (Figure S5). The characteristics and properties of the P3 block
copolymer are summarized in Table 2.

by GPC with PMMA standards.

The RAFT polymerization kinetics of HMssEt in the presence of the
P2 macroRAFT agent was studied. As can be seen in Figure 4, the polymerization was well-controlled.
Polymerization was first order after an induction period for 30 min,
which is due to the slow establishment of RAFT equilibrium. Molecular
weight evolved to the high molecular region over conversion, and dispersity
remained low (Mw/Mn < 1.2) during polymerization. Furthermore, the possible
activation of bromine end groups of the P2 macroRAFT agent under RAFT
polymerization conditions at 70 °C could be insignificant due
to polymethacrylate radicals.59,61

Figure 4 First-order kinetics
plot over time (a) and evolution of molecular
weight and molecular weight distribution over conversion (b) for RAFT
polymerization of HMssEt, initiated with AMBN in the presence of the
P2 macroRAFT agent. Conditions for RAFT polymerization: [HMssEt]o/[P2]o/[AMBN]o = 50:1:0.3 in anisole
at 70 °C, HMssEt/anisole = 0.6 w/w.

These results suggest that strategy I composed of three steps
in
the order of (1) ATRP, (2) carbodiimide-coupling reaction, and (3)
RAFT polymerization enables the synthesis of well-controlled block
copolymers consisting of a POEOMA block covalently linked to a PHMssEt
block through a spacer functionalized with dual acetal and disulfide
linkages, thus POEOMA–AC–SS–PHMssEt diblock copolymer.

Strategy II (ATRP–ATRP)
Given the successful
synthesis of well-defined P1-20 by ATRP, the second step for strategy
II was the azidation (Scheme 3). This reaction enables the conversion of the terminal bromine
group of P1 to the corresponding azido group; more importantly, the
azidation could eliminate the ability of P1 toward ATRP for the next
steps. Adopted from the literature,52 azidation
used excess sodium azide (25 mole equivalent to Br groups of P1),
yielding an azido-terminated P4 homopolymer. An attempt to quantify
azidation with end group analysis by 1H NMR was not straightforward
due to the bulkiness of POEOMA (Figure S6). GPC analysis shows no significant change in molecular weight after
azidation (Figure S7). Promisingly, Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy could be used to follow azidation as
the FT-IR spectrum of P4 shows the presence of terminal azido groups
at 2117 cm–1 (Figure S8). Then, the third step was a base-catalyzed coupling reaction of
the terminal OH group of P4 with Br-iBuBr, yielding a bromine-terminated
P5 macroinitiator for ATRP. To prevent the possible cleavage of the
acetal group by HBr (a strong acid) formed during the reaction, a
large excess of Et3N (12 mole equivalent to polymer) was
used. 1H NMR analysis indicates >95% coupling efficiency
(Figure S9a).

The last step was the
ATRP of HMssEt in the presence of the purified P5 macroinitiator.
The polymerization of HMssEt in the presence of P5 was well-controlled
with first-order kinetics, a linear increase in molecular weight,
and narrow molecular weight distribution (Figure S10). After being purified at monomer conversion = 85%, the
P6 copolymer was characterized (see Table 2). 1H NMR in Figure S9b shows the presence of pendant disulfide linkages
at 2.9 ppm (l and m) and pendant OEO moieties at 3.4–3.7 ppm
(EO). Using their integral ratio with the DP of the POEOMA block =
14, the DP of the PHMssEt block was determined to be 30. GPC analysis
shows that molecular weight distribution of the copolymer clearly
evolved to a high molecular weight region with no evidence of a significant
amount of residual P5 ATRP macroinitiator. Copolymer P6 had Mn = 19.1 kg/mol and Mw/Mn = 1.25 (Figure S7).

These results suggest that strategy II composed
of four steps in
the order of (1) ATRP, (2) azidation, (3) base-catalyzed-coupling,
and (4) ATRP enables the formation of well-controlled POEOMA–AC–SS–PHMssEt
diblock copolymer.

Strategy III Exploring Concurrent ATRP/RAFT
to Synthesize Triblock
Copolymer
As illustrated in Scheme 4, strategy III began with RAFT polymerization
of OEOMA initiated with AMBN in anisole at 70 °C. The polymerization
was mediated with CPTP as being designed with [OEOMA]o/[CPTP]o = 25:1. As seen in Figure S11,
the RAFT polymerization of OEOMA was well-controlled; the polymerization
was first order with an induction period for 40 min and GPC traces
evolved to a high molecular weight region over conversion. After purification
at monomer conversion = 71%, the formed POEOMA homopolymer bearing
terminal RAFT moieties and a COOH group (P7) was analyzed. 1H NMR in Figure 5a
shows the presence of aromatic groups at 7.3–7.9 ppm (g) and
pendant OEO groups at 4.2 ppm (b) and 3.4–3.7 ppm (EO). Using
their integral ratio, the DP of POEOMA block was determined to be
24, which is 6 units greater than the theoretically calculated DP
(DP = 18). GPC analysis indicates that Mn = 5.1 kg/mol with Mw/Mn = 1.2 (Figure S12).

Scheme 4 Strategy III to Synthesize Triblock
Copolymer (P9) Consisting of
POEOMA and PHMssEt Blocks
The second step was the carbodiimide-mediated coupling
reaction
of the carboxylic acid group of P7 with excess A2 (5 mole equivalent
to COOH groups in P7) in the presence of Et3N. 1H NMR spectrum in Figure 5b shows the appearance of new peaks corresponding to protons
in A2 species (d–h). Their integral ratio to aromatic protons
in RAFT species confirms a quantitative coupling efficiency (>98%),
suggesting the successful synthesis of a POEOMA bearing a terminal
bromine group (P8). The third step was the ATRP of HMssEt in the presence
of the P8 macroinitiator. Monomer conversion increased over time;
however, the polymerization rate slowed down after 1 h (Figure S13). This is presumably due to the loss
of the terminal bromine groups or Cu(I) active centers. After being
purified at 65% monomer conversion, 1H NMR spectrum in Figure 5c shows the presence
of pendant OEO units at 3.4–3.7 and 4.2 ppm, and pendant disulfide
species at 2.9 ppm. Their integral ratio with the DP of POEOMA = 24
allows the determination of the DP of the PHMssEt block to be 30,
which is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated value
(DP = 26). Furthermore, the spectrum shows the aromatic protons (q) presented in the terminal RAFT species, suggesting the
occurrence of concurrent mechanism. GPC analysis indicates that the
resulting block copolymer had Mn = 10.5
kg/mol with Mw/Mn = 1.2 (Figure S12).

P8 is
functionalized with both phenyl dithioester and bromine groups
at the chain ends. Under ATRP conditions, the dithioester group acts
as an alkyl pseudo-halide for the ATRP mechanism.60 Consequently, the P8 macroRAFT agent could facilitate the
polymerization of HMssEt to form PHMssEt blocks through the concurrent
ATRP/RAFT mechanism, thus yielding PHMssEtx–AC–SS–POEOMA24-b-PHMssEty triblock copolymer (where x + y = 30). The formation of triblock
copolymer is further supported with our stimuli-responsive degradation
study in the next section.

Stimuli-Responsive Degradation and Structural
Investigation
of Block Copolymers
The formed block copolymers contain both
acetal and disulfide linkages at the block junction as well as pendant
disulfide linkages in the PHMssEt block. These labile linkages can
be cleaved in the presence of a reducing agent (to disulfide) or acidic
pH (to acetal). Here, reduction- and acidic pH-responsive degradation
of the three copolymers (P3, P6, and P9) were examined in organic
solution. Their aliquots dissolved in an organic solvent (either dimethylformamide
(DMF) or chloroform) were treated with either hydrogen chloride for
72 h or 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) as a typical reducing agent (5 mole
equivalent to disulfide linkages in the copolymers) for 24 h.

The degradation of P3 copolymer synthesized through strategy I was
first investigated and Figure 6a shows the degraded products of P3 in response to acidic
pH and reduction. Figure 6b compares the GPC traces of P3 before and after treatment
with stimuli (DTT or HCl), compared with the P1 precursor (POEOMA–AC–SS–OH
homopolymer). Upon the cleavage of a junction acetal linkage with
acid treatment, the possible degraded products include POEOMA–OH,
acetaldehyde, and OH–SS–PHMssEt. The GPC trace of degraded
products shows two peaks with a decrease in the Mn from 14.0 kg/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.2) to 9.9 kg/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.2). A peak shown in the
lower molecular weight region overlapped with that of the P1 POEOMA
precursor, suggesting the presence of POEOMA–OH species. To
analyze the nature of the other peak shown in the higher molecular
weight region, the degraded products were precipitated from methanol
(MeOH). 1H NMR analysis indicates that the precipitate
is mainly PHMssEt homopolymer (Figure S14) and its GPC trace overlapped with the peak in the high molecular
weight region (Figure S15). These results
confirm the presence of HO–SS–PHMssEt species. In addition
to GPC analysis, 1H NMR analysis of degraded products shows
the presence of acetaldehyde at 9.6 ppm (corresponding to aldehyde
proton) as a consequence of the cleavage of the junction acetal linkage
of the P3 copolymer (Figure S16). Upon
the cleavage of disulfide linkages with DTT, the degraded products
include POEOMA–AC–SH, HS–PHMSH, and Et–SH.
The GPC trace of the degraded products show two peaks with a decreasing Mn from 14.0 to 9.2 kg/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.2). Similarly, the
peaks correspond to POEOMA and PHMSH species. These results confirm
that P3 is a diblock copolymer consisting of POEOMA and PHMssEt blocks
as strategy I is designed to synthesize the diblock copolymer. During
the RAFT polymerization in the presence of P2 (containing both bromine
and RAFT groups), the bromine group in P2 did not appear to be activated
toward ATRP.

Figure 6 Schematic illustration of degradation (a) and GPC traces
(b) of
P3 before and after treatment with acid and DTT, compared with P1
precursor (POEOMA homopolymer).

Figure S17 compares the GPC traces
of
the P6 copolymer synthesized through strategy II before and after
the treatment with acid and DTT. Similar to P3, the GPC traces of
degraded products significantly overlapped with that of the P1 POEOMA
homopolymer, with a decrease in molecular weight. These results suggest
that P6 synthesized through strategy II is the diblock copolymer consisting
of POEOMA and PHMssEt blocks. This means that the conversion of bromine
to an azido group could be very quantitative; otherwise, the triblock
copolymer could be formed as a result of the chain extension of HMssEt
at both end chains of POEOMA (P6).

Next, the degradation of
the P9 triblock copolymer synthesized
through strategy III was examined. Figure 7a shows the possible degraded products in
response to acidic pH or DTT. Figure 7b compares the GPC traces of P9 before and after treatment
with acid. The molecular weight of the degraded products decreased
from Mn = 10.5 to 9.2 kg/mol; however,
unlike P3 and P6, their GPC trace did not overlap with that of its
P7 POEOMA precursor. Considering that the copolymer contains 41 wt
% of OEOMA units (DP = 24 for OEOMA units and 30 for HMssEt units),
the GPC analysis suggests no presence of the POEOMA homopolymer block
in the P9 copolymer. When P9 was incubated with DTT, similar results
from GPC analysis were observed for reduction-responsive degraded
products: decrease in molecular weight and no overlap with the P7
precursor. Combined with the reported results that dithioester species
can be activated under ATRP conditions for styrene and methacrylate
monomers,60 our dual-stimuli-responsive
degradation results support that strategy III enables the synthesis
of a triblock copolymer consisting of POEOMA and PHMssEt blocks.

Conclusions
Well-defined
ABPs featured with the dual acetal/disulfide linkage
junction at hydrophilic POEOMA and hydrophobic PHMssEt blocks were
synthesized. Three strategies exploring the combination of ATRP and
RAFT polymerization techniques in sequential or concurrent mechanisms
were established with a dual acidic pH/reduction-responsive initiator
having terminal hydroxyl and bromine groups. Two strategies I and
II employing sequential ATRP–RAFT and ATRP–ATRP mechanisms
resulted in the synthesis of diblock copolymers of POEOMA–AC–SS–PHMssEt
(P3 and P6) with similar sequence and architecture, but with different
chain end groups. Furthermore, two strategies allow for excellent
control over the chain length of both blocks as well as exhibit similar
extent of dual-stimuli-responsive degradation. Strategy III utilizing
RAFT polymerization followed by ATRP in the presence of a dithioester-labeled
ATRP macroinitiator resulted in the synthesis of a triblock copolymer
of PHMssEt–AC–SS–POEOMA-b-PHMssEt
(P9) through a concurrent mechanism of ATRP and RAFT polymerization.
Further investigation into dual-stimuli-responsive degradation provided
additional confirmation to the structural analysis of the synthesis
of diblock and triblock copolymers.

Experimental Section
Instrumentation
1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a 500 MHz Varian spectrometer. The CDCl3 singlet
at 7.26 ppm was selected as the reference standard. Spectral features
are tabulated in the following order: chemical shift (ppm); multiplicity
(s-singlet, d-doublet, t-triplet, m-complex multiple); number of protons;
position of protons. For the synthesis of (co)polymers, monomer conversion
was determined by 1H NMR analysis. Molecular weight and
molecular weight distribution of the (co)polymers were determined
by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). An Agilent GPC was equipped
with a 1260 Infinity Isocratic Pump and a RI detector. Two Agilent
PLgel mixed-C and mixed-D columns were used with DMF containing 0.1
mol % LiBr at 50 °C at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Linear poly(methyl
methacrylate) standards from Fluka were used for calibration. Aliquots
of the polymer samples were dissolved in DMF/LiBr. The clear solutions
were filtered using a 0.40 μm PTFE filter to remove any DMF-insoluble
species. A drop of anisole was added as a flow rate marker. Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was recorded on a Nicolet
iS5 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).

Materials
Most
reagents including triethylamine (Et3N, 99.5%), bromoisobutyryl
bromide (Br-iBuBr, 98%), pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate
(PPTS, 98%), 4-cyano-4-(phenylcarbonothioylthio)pentanoic
acid (CPTP), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), and deuterium chloride (DCl)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, except for 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide-HCl
salt (EDC) from Matrix Innovation and 2,2′-azodi(2-methylbutyronitrile)
(AMBN) from Wako chemicals. Solvents include ethyl acetate (EA), hexane
(HE), dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform (CHCl3), methanol (MeOH), and diethyl ether (Et2O). All
chemicals and solvents were used as received. Oligo(ethylene glycol)
monomethyl ether methacrylate (OEOMA) with Mw = 300 g/mol purchased from Sigma-Aldrich was purified by
passing through a column filled with basic aluminum oxide to remove
the inhibitor. Tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (TPMA)67 and a methacrylate having a pendant disulfide linkage (HMssEt)68 were synthesized.

Synthesis of Vinyl Ether–Br
(A1)
Br-iBuBr (17.2
g, 74.9 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution containing vinyl ether
ethylene glycol (6.0 g, 68.0 mmol) and Et3N (8.2 g, 81.7
mmol) dissolved in DCM (60 mL) in an ice bath for 20 min. The resulting
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 h. After the removal
of the formed by-products (Et3N–HBr adducts) by
vacuum filtration, additional DCM (150 mL) was added. The mixture
was washed with brine (150 mL) five times, and then dried over sodium
sulfate. The evaporation of the solvent yielded the product, a dark
yellow residue (14.5 g, 90%); Rf = 0.93
on silica (6:4 v/v HE/EA). 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm):
6.46 ppm (dd, 1H, CH2OCH−),

g, 38.9 mmol) was added dropwise to a clear solution containing
2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (6.0 g, 38.9 mmol), PPTS (0.97 g, 3.9 mmol),
and anhydrous DCM (150 mL) in an ice bath for 20 min. The reaction
mixture was stirred vigorously for 6.5 h at room temperature, and
then quenched by the addition of Et3N (1 mL). After being
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH = 7.4, 100 mL) three
times, the product was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using HE/EA (6:4 v/v). The product, yellow oil, was collected as the
second of the total four bands off a silica gel column, yielding 6.4
g (42%); Rf = 0.33 on silica (6:4 v/v
HE/EA). 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): 4.82 ppm (m, 1H,
−OCH(CH3)O−), 4.33
ppm (m, 2H, (−CH2CH2OC(O)−), 3.85 ppm (m, 4H, −CH2OCH(CH3)OCH2−), 3.73 ppm (t, 2H, −CH2OH), 2.89 ppm (m, 4H, −CH2SSCH2−), 1.94 ppm
(s, 6H, C(CH3)2Br), 1.34
ppm (d, 3H, −OCH(CH3)O−).

91%).

Synthesis of P4
A mixture containing the purified P1-20
