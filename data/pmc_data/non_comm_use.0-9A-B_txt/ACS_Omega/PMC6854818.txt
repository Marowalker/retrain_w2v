The nanocarbon particles and diesel
are used as hydrophobic solid
particles and the liquid phrase to produce the mixture collector for
the flotation separation of unburned carbon (UC) particles from gasification
ash. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectrometry and
mercury porosimeter measures were used to prove the filling of nanocarbon
particles in the pores of UC particles. Mercury porosimeter results
illustrate that the pores of the UC particles after the action of
the mixture of nanocarbon particles and diesel are reduced compared
with that after the action of diesel. The number of >4000 nm pore
was significantly reduced, and the number of <250 nm pore nearly
disappeared. The results of the flotation tests found that the use
of the mixture of nanocarbon particles and diesel as a collector resulted
in not only increasing the concentrate yield but also reducing the
ash of the concentrate. Throughout this investigation, the filling
of nanocarbon particles in the UC holes/pores plays an important role
in the enhancement of flotation recovery of UC particles. The filled
pores in the UC particle surface can increase the contact area between
bubbles and UC particles, thereby increasing the adhesion of bubble–particles,
reducing the probability of particle detachment, and ultimately improving
the flotation recovery of UC.

1 Introduction
Coal gasification ash
as an important proportion of fly ash and
its comprehensive utilization become an important factor in achieving
circular economy in the coal chemical project. Unburned carbon (UC)
is one of the resources in the gasification ash.1 Most of the UC entrained in the syngas produced by the
gasifier have high carbon content and strong water absorption. Matjie
et al. studied the basic characteristics of gasification ash and its
residual carbon,2−4 which found that the UC is porous and mostly has
a sponge-like structure. If the gasification ash is directly blended
into the boiler, the calorific value of the coal powder will greatly
reduce.5 If it is directly used as cement
or concrete and other materials, these UC particles will reduce the
strength of concrete because of its strong water absorption.6 When preparing concrete products as aggregates
or admixtures, the consistency of the slurry can be increased, the
setting time is prolonged, and the strength is then lowered. Furthermore,
the durability of concrete products is affected, if the gasification
ash is effectively separated into two products: UC and ash particles.
The UC can be directly blended into the boiler while the high ash
particles can be used in the production of cement, concrete, and masonry.
Therefore, the gasification ash needs separation to recover low ash
carbon particles, which greatly improves the energy utilization efficiency
and benefits the potential value of these secondary resources.

Froth flotation was invented in 1905 for mineral separation.7 Froth flotation is carried out on the basis of
surface chemistry, and fine mineral particles are separated on the
basis of their hydrophobicity difference.8,9 Recently,
the candle soot has been found to be super-hydrophobic. They can be
prepared through spraying of nanocarbon particles collected by incomplete
combustion of the candle.10 At present,
the preparation methods of nanocarbon particles mainly include arc
discharge, synthesis, pyrolysis organic, laser ablation, ultrasonic-assisted,
microwave-assisted, and microwave hydrothermal-assisted method, and
so forth.11 These methods were costly.
In industrial production, carbon particles in the mixture collector
can be prepared by collecting incomplete combustion products of waste
incineration and coal power plants, carbonaceous waste generated by
petrochemical plants, and cracking of natural gas and coalbed methane.
This is also a way to recycle waste resources. Xia et al. enhanced
the coal flotation by the mixture of nanocarbon particles and n-dodecane as an efficient flotation collector.12 They found that nanocarbon particles can adsorb
on the coal surface and increase the surface roughness of coal particle.13 The nanocarbon particles can improve the hydrophobicity
of coal surface and they can accelerate the rupture of liquid film
during the attachment of bubbles and hydrophobic particles. The conventional
flotation of UC from gasification ash is difficult because the pores
of the UC particles may be filled with water causing the difficulty
in the attachment of UC particles and bubbles.14

In this paper, nanocarbon particles with diesel create
a kind of
mixture collector for gasification ash flotation. The nanocarbon particles
were filled in the pores of UC particles during the condition and
flotation of gasification ash. In this paper, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and mercury porosimeter measurement were used to illustrate
why the mixture collector can improve UC flotation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Gasification Ash Flotation
Results
The flotation results of gasification ash using different
collectors
are shown in Figure 1. The mixture of diesel and nanocarbon particles is used as the collector,
and the yield of floated UC particles is significantly higher than
that of diesel. However, the ash content of floated UC using diesel
is higher than that using the mixture collector as the collector.
This represents that the mixture collector of diesel and nanocarbon
particles enhances the recovery of UC particles from gasification
ash. The floated UC particles can be used as the pulverized coal because
it only has about 18–21% ash content. In order to evaluate
the flotation effect of two collectors on UC particles in gasification
ash, the combustible recovery rate was calculated from the following
equation.15  where YC is the
yield of the clean coal (%); YF is the
yield of the feed (%), 100%; AC is the
ash content of the clean coal (%); and AF is the ash content of the feed (%).

Figure 1 Flotation results of UC particles using
the diesel and mixture
collector.

As is shown in Figure 2, regardless of the dosage
of collector, the mixed collector
has better recovery effect on UC (combustible) in the gasification
ash than diesel.

mixture

2.2 Mechanism
Analysis
2.2.1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Results
As is shown in Figure 3, Xia et al. found that the atomic content of C 1s is nearly
93% of the surface of nanocarbon particles through the fitting results
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.12 However, that of O 1s is nearly 7%.

Figure 3 XPS result of nanocarbon
particles, (a) is the wide energy spectrum;
(b) is the C 1s peak.12

For C 1s peaks, they found that the content of C=C
and C–C
on the nanocarbon particle surface is nearly 82 and 13%, respectively.
However, the proportion of C–O group on the surface of nanocarbon
particles is about 6%. It means that the nanocarbon particles are
very hydrophobic. In our previous study, the contact angle of nanocarbon
particles is also very higher, nearly 136°.12

Figure 4 shows the
XPS wide energy spectrum and the fitting results of C 1s. The surface
of fly ash is 83% C 1s and 17% O 1s. It is found that most of the
elements on the surface of gasification ash are C and O by XPS wide
energy spectroscopy. In addition, the XPS wide energy spectrum results
of the gasification ash showed that the UC particle surface did not
adsorb lots of harmful elements such as mercury and chloride and could
be directly recovered as a fuel for the boiler.

Figure 4 XPS result of gasification
ash, (a) is the wide energy spectrum;
(b) is the C 1s peak.

For C 1s peaks, C–C/C–H,
C–O, C=O,
O–C–O, COOH, CO32–, and
COO– bonds correspond to the following binding energies
284.8, 285.5, 286.6, 287.8, 289.1, 290.7, and 292.0 eV, respectively.16−18 The content of C–C/C–H on the gasification ash surface
is 65.22%, while the C–O is 8.39%, and the content of C=O
is 10.28%. The content of O–C–O is 3.75%. The COOH is
4.98%. However, the content of CO32– is
4.08%. The content of COO– is 3.29%. The C–C/C–H
functional groups are hydrophobic while the functional groups of C–O,
C=O, O–C–O, COOH, CO32–, and COO– are hydrophilic. The gasification ash
surface is relatively much more hydrophilic than the nanocarbon particle
surface. If the nanocarbon particles can adsorb on the UC particle
surface, the floatability and hydrophobicity of the UC particles should
be enhanced and hence its flotation recovery will also be increased.
Further investigations are given through porosimeter analysis and
SEM/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) analysis.

2.2.2 Porosimeter Analysis
Figure 5 illustrates the porosity of
the UC particles after the action of the diesel and mixture collector.
The porosity of the UC particles by the mixture collector is generally
reduced compared with that of the UC particles by the diesel, especially
the micropores smaller than 250 nm are substantially disappeared,
and the pores larger than 4000 nm are significantly reduced. Also,
the reduction in these pores indicates that the nanocarbon particles
can effectively fill in the pores of UC particles. Some chemical bonds
of atoms on the solid surface are in an unsaturated state. This feature
causes an adsorption field on the solid surface. Under the action
of the adsorption field, the external molecules aggregate on the solid
surface19 because the surface area of the
pores is larger, and the surface residual energy is higher than the
outside surface of the particles.20 Therefore,
the nanocarbon particles are more easily adsorbed by the inner surface
of the pores, thereby filling the pores.

Figure 5 Pore distribution of
UC particles using the diesel and mixture
collector.

2.2.3 SEM/EDS
Analysis
Figure 6 is the scanning electron microscope
results of the UC after the action of the diesel and mixture collector. Figure 7 is the EDS results
of UC particle surface using the diesel and mixture collector. The
particles adsorbed on the surface of UC particles using diesel are
less than that using the mixture collector. In addition, the pores
of UC particles using diesel have fewer filled particles than the
UC particles using the mixture collector as shown in the rectangle
in Figure 6. The large
flocs of nanocarbon particles in the mixed collector filled the macropores
in the UC particles and the small flocs filled the micropores, eventually
leading to the pore reduction. As well known, nanocarbon particles
adsorbed on the coal surface can accelerate the rupture of liquid
film during the attachment of particles and bubbles.12 Furthermore, Chen et al. found that the coal surface hydrophobic
gradually increased with the decrease of roughness.21

Figure 6 SEM pictures of UC particles using the diesel (a) and mixture collector
(b).

Figure 7 EDS results of the UC particle surface using
the diesel and mixture
collector.

As shown in Figure 8, the surface of UC particles has pore filled
by water during the
flotation process. The filling of water in the UC particle pores forms
the “water pocket”.22,23 However, the
pores in hydrophobic surface usually entrap the air which forms the
“air pocket”.16 The water
pocket reduces the solid contact area for the bubble–particle
adhesion. The UC particles after the filling of hydrophobic nanocarbon
particles in pores can increase the hydrophobic solid area for the
adhesion of bubble–coal surface. In addition, the adhesion
probability of particles and bubbles can be enhanced because the pores
will be filled with the hydrophobic solid nanocarbon particles instead
of the water. This ultimately leads to an increase in the attachment
and decrease in the detachment because the contact area between coal
surface and bubble is enlarged.24 Therefore,
the yield of the floated UC particles is higher for the mixture collector
than diesel.

particle
pores increasing the bubble–particle adhesion area.

3 Conclusions
The
flotation recovery of UC particles from gasification ash with
the diesel and nanocarbon particle mixture is better than that with
diesel as the collector. The mixture collector not only increases
the yield of floated UC particles significantly but also decreases
its ash content. Nanocarbon particles can effectively fill in the
pores of the UC particles, increasing the hydrophobic solid area for
the adhesion of bubble–coal surface and enhance the adhesion
probability of particles and bubbles. This ultimately leads to an
increase in the attachment of UC particles onto the bubble surface
and the decrease in the detachment of UC particles from bubbles. Therefore,
the yield of the floated UC is higher for the mixture collector compared
to the diesel.

4 Experiment and Methods
4.1 Gasification Ash Samples and Experiment Materials
The
gasification ash comes from the Shell coal gasifier of Datong
Coal Mine Group, Shanxi, China. The coal reacts with steam and oxygen
in a gasifier to produce crude syngas and ash. The gasification ash
entrained in the crude syngas contains partially UC. The UC forms
gasification ash through the condensing purification system. The proximate
analysis (on air dry basis) of gasification ash (<0.5 mm) is shown
in Table 1. The ash
content of this gasification ash sample is low, which means that the
gasification ash samples contain amounts of combustible matter.

The gasification ash sample size
composition (on dry basis) is
listed in Table 2.
In addition, the ash content and yield of <0.045 mm is more than
those of other size fractions. Tap water was used in the flotation
experiments. The properties of tap water are shown in Table 3.

4.2 Preparation
of the Novel Flotation Collector
The recovery procedure of
nanocarbon particles (candle soot) is
similar to that of Qahtan et al.10 The
experimental operation is displayed in Figure 9a. Place a 250 mL glass beaker upside down
on top of four candle flames so that the incompletely burned area
hits the inside of the beaker for some time. Finally, the nanocarbon
particles are collected as in Figure 9b.

Figure 9 Nanocarbon particle recovery apparatus (a), nanocarbon
particles
(b) and mixture of diesel and nanocarbon particles (c).12

The novel flotation collector
preparation method is the same as
that published by Xia et al.12 The candle
soot (1 g) was added into 150 mL diesel. Figure 9c shows that the mixture of nanocarbon particles
and diesel was presented. Figure 10 shows that the nanocarbon particle flocs were distributed
in the mixture collector. The average size of the nanocarbon particle
floc-diesel droplet in the flotation pulp was about 10–20 μm
indicated by the focused beam reflectance measurement.

Figure 10 Dispersion
state of nanocarbon particles in the mixture collector.

4.3 Flotation Experiments
In this paper,
the 1.5 L cell of XFD flotation experimental machine was used for
gasification ash flotation. The pulp concentration was 4%. The mixture
of nanocarbon particles and diesel or diesel was used as the collector.
Their dosages were 5000, 7000, 9000, and 11 000 g/t gasification
ash. Sec-octyl alcohols of 4000 g/t were used as the frother. The
impeller rotation was 1900 rpm.

First, adding the gasification
ash sample and water to the flotation cell and mixed for 1 min. Then,
the water-gasification ash pulp was conditioned for 2 min with the
collector. After then, the pulp was conditioned for 0.5 min after
adding the frother. Finally, the air flow (15 L/h) was given for 10
s. Collect flotation concentrate for 3 min. Drying at 90 °C and
weighing tailings and concentrates. Evaluation of the difference of
gasification ash flotation performance using the diesel or the mixture
of nanocarbon particles and diesel by concentrate (floats) yield and
ash content.

4.4 XPS Tests
XPS
tests of nanocarbon
particles and UC particles were performed in an ultra-high vacuum
system using the surface analysis system (ESCALAB 250 Xi, USA) at
room temperature. XPS peak fitting software was used for data processing
(peak fitting).

4.5 SEM/EDS Tests
The SEM test for floating
UC at the collector dosage is 9000 g/t. SIGMA 500 SEM (Carl Zeiss,
Germany) was used to analyze the filling of nanocarbon particles in
the pores of UC particle. A layer of gold is sprayed on the surface
of sample to increase conductivity before the SEM/EDS tests.

4.6 Mercury Porosimeter Tests
Mercury
porosimetry is a very useful pore size of material testing technique.
The pore can be investigated between 500 μm and 3.5 nm. Mercury
porosimetry can provide the pore size distribution, the porosity,
and total pore volume.25−28 The mercury porosimeter tests for floated UC particles of the collector
dosage are 9000 g/t. Using the Autopore IV 9500 high-performance automatic
mercury intrusion instrument produced by Micromeritics in the United
States, the filling of nano-carbon particles in UC particle pore was
analyzed.
