The formation process
of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM)-based ionic microgels was investigated in this work. Different
from the traditional formation process of covalent bond cross-linked
PNIPAM-based microgels, a disassembling and reassembling process for
PNIPAM-based ionic microgels was observed. During the formation process,
loose microgels were first formed in a short time, and then, these
loose microgels disassembled into smaller nanogel pieces. Meanwhile,
the nanogel pieces reassembled into microgels by electrostatic interaction.
After reassembling, large amounts of nanogels could be seen clearly
in the interior of PNIPAM-based ionic microgels. The thermo-sensitivity
and composition of the final prepared microgels were characterized
by dynamic light scattering, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.

Introduction
Microgels as soft materials have been
applied in many areas such
as drug delivery systems,1,2 catalysts,3,4 and nanotechnology.5,6 Owing to their wide applications,
many types of microgels are prepared including polyacrylamide,7,8 poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM),9−11 and poly(acrylic acid) microgels.12,13 Among them,
the most studied is PNIPAM-based microgels for their thermo-sensitivity.
Generally, they are covalent bond cross-linked with the cross-linker N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAA).
However, sedimentation always occurs during the formation process.
This is because the cross-linker MBAA also participates in the polymerization
as a co-monomer and copolymerizes with NIPAM. However, with the development
of polymer science, a new type of PNIPAM-based microgel is reported
without the participation of MBAA.14−16 A second tertiary amine
monomer which provides cross-linking sites and a dibromoalkane compound
which is used as a cross-linker are applied in this system. The cross-linker
here does not participate in the polymerization process. The cross-linking
reaction is quaternarization of the tertiary amine monomer and the
dibromoalkane compound, which happens after the polymer chains are
formed. Thus, ionic bonds are produced which differ from the traditional
covalent ones. Considering that the mechanism for forming PNIPAM-based
ionic microgels is quite different from the traditional covalent bond
cross-linked ones, to study the formation process of PNIPAM-based
ionic microgels becomes necessary and significant.

As far as
we know, kinetic study of the microgel formation process
is rare in these years. Understanding the essence of the formation
process for a new material will provide us robust evidence for further
scientific research. As a fundamental study, we investigated the formation
process of the recently reported PNIPAM-based ionic microgels in this
work. Different from the traditional covalent bond cross-linked PNIPAM-based
microgels,17−19 the formation process for PNIPAM-based ionic microgels
was a disassembling and reassembling process. In this process, loose
microgels were first formed in a short time and then disassembled
into nanogel pieces. Meanwhile, reassembling of these nanogel pieces
occurred. After the disassembling and reassembling process, the final
microgels containing numerous of nanogel pieces within their interiors
were obtained.

Results and Discussion
PNIPAM-based
ionic microgels (encoded as PNI microgels) were prepared
by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization as shown in Scheme 1. The formation process of
PNI microgels has been presumably reported in Du’s group.14 Their description for the formation process
gave us a brief impression, which was easy to understand, as shown
in the following. Because of the existence of NIPAM units, the early
formed poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-1-vinylimidazole) (p(NIPAM-co-VIM)) polymer chains
in the polymerization process were thermo-sensitive and aggregated
into hydrophobic nanospheres. As the cross-linker was also hydrophobic,
it penetrated into these nanospheres and chemically cross-linked them
by quaternization. With the polymerization going on, the latter formed
p(NIPAM-co-VIM) polymer chains adsorbed onto the
surface of the chemically cross-linked nanospheres and then were cross-linked
by the cross-linker. The nanospheres grew larger and larger until
monomers were exhausted. After microgels were formed, they became
smaller and smaller in size on a small scale because of the further
penetration of the cross-linker (Scheme 2, route 1).

Scheme 1 Reaction Equation
of PNI Microgels
Scheme 2 Illustration of the Formation Process of PNI Microgels
However, the detailed formation
process for PNI microgels was quite
different from the above reported ones. We investigated the formation
process in detail as shown in Figure 1. According to our investigation, the formation process
of PNI microgels could be divided into two stages: (i) PNI microgels
were first formed in a loose state within 1 h. They were in a loose
state as they could change their shape after dehydration (Figure 1a). This was because
only a small amount of cross-linkers penetrated into microgels in
this state, resulting in a low degree of cross-linking. Then, the
diameter of PNI microgels became smaller and smaller in a short time
(Figure 1b). This was
due to the further penetration of cross-linker into PNI microgels.
They became hard with cross-linking, so that they were in a spherical
shape after dehydration. In this stage, there were still linear p(NIPAM-co-VIM) polymer chains forming and aggregating into nanospheres
outside these early formed PNI microgels. However, most of the cross-linker
had already penetrated into the early formed microgels because of
the hydrophobic interaction. Concentration difference of cross-linkers
existed between the early formed PNI microgels and the latter formed
nanospheres. Thus, redistribution of cross-linker happened between
them. The redistribution of cross-linker led to the disassembling
of PNI microgels which entered into stage (ii) as show in Figure 1c,d. In this stage,
PNI microgels split into smaller nanogel pieces gradually with the
exudation of cross-linker from PNI microgels to nanospheres. Meanwhile
the nanogel pieces became smaller and smaller due to the penetration
of cross-linker. As could be seen in Scheme 1, cross-linking was a reaction of quaternization
in which organic salt was formed. Thus, negatively charged bromide
ions could dissociate from the nanogel pieces. Similarly, nanogel
pieces were positively charged after dissociation of bromide ions.
So, these freely charged ions and nanogels reassembled into microgels
with the disassembling of PNI microgels as shown in Figure 1e,f. During the whole process,
disassembling and assembling were simultaneous. This investigated
process was depicted in the route 2 of Scheme 2.

Figure 1 Formation process of PNI microgels investigated
by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) at different time points. (a) 60 min; PNI
microgels were first formed but in a loose state. (b) 90 min; cross-linker
penetrated into these loose PNI microgels and enhanced the hardness
of PNI microgels. (c) 120 min; because of the competing for cross-linker
between the early formed PNI microgels and the latter formed nanospheres,
PNI microgels began to be split as the cross-linker oozed from them.
(d) 150 min; nanogel pieces reassembled into PNI microgels. (e) 180
min; in the process of disassembling and reassembling, the nanogel
pieces became smaller and smaller because of the penetration of the
cross-linker. (f) 240 min; finally, PNI microgels were formed after
the disassembling and reassembling process.

To verify our investigation, confirmatory experiments were
performed
by controlling the monomer concentration. As had been reported,14 with increasing the monomer concentration, the
diameter of PNI microgels increased. This conclusion did not conflict
with our results as shown in Figure 2. However, according to our proposed formation process,
stage (ii) could disappear by lowering the monomer concentration.
In this situation, once the PNI microgels were formed in the early
stage, monomers were consumed immediately when the monomer concentration
was super low. Thus, no latter formed linear p(NIPAM-co-VIM) polymer chains appeared and competed for the cross-linker with
the early formed loose PNI microgels. As verification, the diameter
of the PNI microgels prepared at low monomer concentration increased
dramatically as shown in Figure 3. In fact, some nanogel pieces were formed outside
the PNI microgels as shown in Figure 4a. But they could not split the PNI microgels at the
early stage by forming concentration difference as they were in a
small amount. They just adsorbed onto the surface of PNI microgels
as shown in Figure 4b.

Figure 2 PNI microgels with different diameters prepared by varying the
monomer concentrations. (a) Monomer concentration: 60 mM of NIPAM,
9 mM of VIM, and 9 mM of DBB. (b) Monomer concentration: 40 mM of
NIPAM, 6 mM of VIM, and 6 mM of DBB. (c) Monomer concentration: 20
mM of NIPAM, 3 mM of VIM, and 3 mM of DBB.

Figure 3 Comparison of the hydrodynamic diameter of PNI microgels formed
at different monomer concentrations. For each recipe, the concentration
of VIM and DBB relatively increased or decreased in proportion compared
to NIPAM (black line: 20 mM of NIPAM, 3 mM of VIM, and 3 mM of DBB;
red line: 40 mM of NIPAM, 6 mM of VIM, and 6 mM of DBB; blue line:
60 mM of NIPAM, 9 mM of VIM, and 9 mM of DBB; green line: 10 mM of
NIPAM, 1.5 mM of VIM, and 1.5 mM of DBB).

Figure 4 PNI microgels were formed when the monomer concentration was low
enough. Monomer concentration: 10 mM of NIPAM, 1.5 mM of VIM, and
0.75–3 mM of DBB. (a) Nanogel pieces could be seen clearly.
(b) Nanogel pieces adsorbed onto the surface of PNI microgels.

In the formation process of PNI
microgels, monomers could not be
consumed in a short time when the initial monomer concentration was
relative high. In this situation, the latter formed p(NIPAM-co-VIM) polymer chains could split the PNI microgels for
the concentration difference existed. We carefully examined the scope
above which the concentration difference was strong enough to split
PNI microgels. This scope was in the range of 10–15 mM based
on the concentration of NIPAM. It was understandable that the diameter
of PNI microgels increased with increasing the monomer concentration
when it was higher than 15 mM. By controlling the molar ratio of monomers
between NIPAM and VIM, no obvious difference of the formation process
was observed. But no microgels were obtained when the molar percentage
of VIM was higher than 25% compared to NIPAM. This was due to the
fact that p(NIPAM-co-VIM) lost their thermo-sensitivity
when the content of VIM was too high, which prevented the cross-linking
process.

In a statistic analysis of the formation process of
PNI microgels
characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), the diameter variation
of PNI microgels was in accordance with TEM (Figure 5). The PNI microgels were first formed in
a loose state within 1 h. Then, the diameter decreased for the penetration
of cross-linkers in a short time. However, a jump of the diameter
at 120 min could be seen clearly. This was the time point when the
PNI microgels began to disassemble. During this time, cross-linker
began to ooze from the PNI microgels, which led to the increase of
diameter of the PNI microgels. As had been mentioned above, disassembling
and reassembling was a dynamic process. During this process, the cross-linking
reaction happened all the time which made the diameter of PNI microgels
smaller and smaller as a whole.

Figure 5 Variation of the diameter during the formation
process of PNI microgels
investigated by DLS.

The inner structure of the prepared ionic microgels was investigated
by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) as shown
in Figure 6. As could
be seen, lots of nanogels existed within the PNI microgels which further
verified our hypothesis mentioned above. It meant that the formation
process for PNI microgels was related to a process of disassembling
and reassembling. However, nanogels could not be seen when the monomer
concentration was low enough. This indicated that it could not go
through the disassembling and reassembling process when the monomer
concentration was very low.

Figure 6 Inner structure of PNI microgels.

The thermo-sensitivity of the prepared PNI microgels
was characterized
by DLS, as shown in Figure 7. Because of the large amount existence of NIPAM units in
the backbone, the prepared PNI microgels were thermo-sensitive. With
increase of the temperature, the diameter of PNI microgels decreased.
However, because of the insertion of co-monomer VIM in the PNIPAM
polymer chains randomly, the thermo-sensitivity of PNI microgels was
quite different from the reported ones which had a sharp transition
temperature at about 31 °C.20 It was
in a wide temperature transition range from 35 °C to 60 °C.
In addition, the thermo-sensitivity also verified that the nanogel
pieces within the PNI microgels were cross-linked by cross-linker
during the reassembling process, because the PNI microgels were stable
when increasing or decreasing the temperature.

Figure 7 Thermo-sensitivity of
PNI microgels characterized by DLS in water.

According to the DLS data, we could see that both NIPAM and
VIM
existed in the backbone of PNI microgels. However, to further demonstrate
the composition of PNI microgels, infrared spectroscopy (IR) and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the
detailed composition of PNI microgels, as shown in Figure 8. The peak of νC=O at 1645 wavenumbers demonstrated the existence of NIPAM as shown
in Figure 8a. The overlapped
peaks of νC=C and νC=N at 1453 wavenumbers indicated the existence of VIM. The appearance
of the Br element in XPS data demonstrated that the cross-linker of
DBB also existed in the PNI microgels, as shown in Figure 8b.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the formation process of PNI
microgels was observed
and discussed for the first time in our work. Different from the formation
process of the covalent bond cross-linked microgel system, a disassembling
and reassembling process was revealed for PNI microgels. This process
was related to their cross-linking mechanism in which cross-linking
happened in a hydrophobic environment. During this process, redistribution
of the cross-linkers from the early formed PNI microgels to the latter
formed p(NIPAM-co-VIM) polymer chains (they aggregated
into nanospheres) was the driving force in disassembling of PNI microgels
for the existence of concentration difference of the cross-linker.
This discovery would provide us guidance for the future study relating
to PNI microgels.

Experiments
Materials
N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAM), 1, 4-dibromobutane
(DBB), and 1-vinylimidazole (VIM) were purchased from Adamas Co. 2,2′-azodiisobutyramidine
dihydrochloride (AIBA) was purchased from Accela Co.

Instrumentation
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was
used to detect the particle size of PNI microgels (Malvern Instruments
Ltd, ZS90). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) was used to
characterize the morphology of PNI microgels (120 kV, FEI, Tecnai
G2 Spirit Biotwin). High resolution transmission electron microscope
(HR-TEM) was used to characterize the inner structure of PNI microgels
(Talos F200X/TALOS F200X). Infrared spectrometer (IR) was used to
characterize the composition of PNI microgels (Spectrum 100, PerkinElmer,
Inc). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize
the elements of PNI microgels (AXIS UltraDLD).

Preparation of PNI Microgels
PNI microgels were synthesized
by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. 2 mmol of NIPAM, 0.3 mmol
of VIM, and 0.3 mmol of DBB were added into a 100 mL three-necked
round-bottom flask containing 45 mL of water. This flask was equipped
with a magnetic stirrer, a condenser, and a nitrogen gas inlet. The
above solution was bubbled for 15 min with nitrogen gas to purge the
oxygen. Then, the temperature of this solution was increased to 70
°C with stirring. After the temperature was stable, 25 mg of
AIBA was dissolved in 5 mL of water and then injected into the above
solution to initiate the polymerization. The stirring speed was kept
at 750 rpm during the whole reaction process. This reaction was allowed
to proceed for at least 6 h and then stopped by cooling down to room
temperature. The obtained solution of PNI microgels was centrifuged
at 9000 rpm for 30 min to remove uncross-linked p(NIPAM-co-VIM) macromolecules. The centrifuged PNI microgels were redispersed
into water by ultrasonic treatment. This centrifugation/redispersion
process was repeated for at least three times. The final purified
PNI microgels were stored in water for further characterization.

Investigation of the Formation Process of PNI Microgels
During the formation process of PNI microgels, 0.5 mL of the solution
was sampled at preset time points. The sample was rapidly cooled down
by putting the vial containing the sample into liquid nitrogen to
stop the reaction. After the sample was restored to room temperature,
they were characterized by TEM and DLS directly, without any purification
process.

Characterization
For characterization by TEM and HR-TEM,
the solution of PNI microgels was first diluted by 100× (adding
10 μL of this solution into 990 μL of water). Then, 20
μL of this diluted solution was added on one side of Formvar-coated
copper grids. After drying the grids at room temperature, they were
used for observation by TEM. The samples were not stained before observation.
For characterization of diameter of PNI microgels, the solution of
PNI microgels was diluted by 10× (adding 100 μL of this
solution of PNI microgels into 900 μL of water). After dilution,
1 mL of this diluted solution was used to characterize the size by
DLS. For characterization by IR and XPS, purified PNI microgels were
freeze-dried before characterization.
