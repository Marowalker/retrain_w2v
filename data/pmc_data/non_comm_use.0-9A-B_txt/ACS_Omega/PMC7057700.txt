Mixed-ligand
oxidovanadium(IV) β-diketonates having NNN-donor dipicolylamine-conjugated
to boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY in L1) and diiodo-BODIPY
(in L2) moieties, namely, [VO(L1)(acac)]Cl (1), [VO(L2)(acac)]Cl (2), and [VO(L1)(dbm)]Cl (3), where acac and dbm are monoanionic
O,O-donor acetylacetone and 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione, were prepared,
characterized, and tested for their photoinduced anticancer activity
in visible light. Complexes 1 and 2 were
structurally characterized as their PF6– salts (1a and 2a) by X-ray crystallography.
They showed VIVN3O3 six-coordinate
geometry with dipicolylamine base as the facial ligand. The non-iodinated
BODIPY complexes displayed absorption maxima at ∼501 nm, while
it is ∼535 nm for the di-iodinated 2 in 10% DMSO–PBS
buffer medium (pH = 7.2). Complexes 1 and 3 being green emissive (λem, ∼512 nm; λex, 470 nm; ΦF, ∼0.10) in 10% aqueous
DMSO were used for cellular imaging studies. Complex 3 localized primarily in the mitochondria of the cervical HeLa cells
with a co-localization coefficient value of 0.7. The non-emissive
diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 showed generation of singlet
oxygen (ΦΔ ≈ 0.47) on light activation.
Annexin-V assay showed singlet oxygen-mediated cellular apoptosis,
making this complex a targeted PDT agent.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy
(PDT) and photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) together have emerged
as two new non-invasive treatment modalities of cancer to reduce the
toxic side effects and to avoid drug resistance resulting from conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin and its analogues.1−10 In PDT, photosensitizers with minimal dark cellular toxicity, after
getting accumulated in the cancerous tissue, get activated on light-irradiation
to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage the cancer cells
while leaving the light unexposed normal tissue intact. Although beneficial
compared to the chemotherapeutic drugs, prolonged use of the FDA (Food
and Drug Administration)-approved PDT drug photofrin is known to cause
severe skin sensitivity and acute hepatotoxicity due to generation
of bilirubin on oxidation of the porphyrin core.11,12 In addition, the macrocyclic porphyrin- and phthalocyanine-based
photosensitizers in general have poor aqueous solubility, thus reducing
their bioavailability. To address the solubility and tumor selectivity
issues, transition metal-based PDT agents with desirable photochemical
and photophysical properties are reported as potential alternatives
to photofrin and its analogues.13−20 Structurally simple β-diketonates derived from different derivatives
of acetylacetone (Hacac) are suitable toward designing a variety of
metal-based anticancer agents.21−25 The first non-platinum metal-based anticancer compound to enter
clinical trials was budotitane, specifically, [cis-diethoxy(1-phenylbutane-1,3-dionato)titanium(IV)], in which the
β-diketonate ligand was used to enhance the lipophilicity of
the complex.26,27 Appropriate hydrophilic–lipophilic
balance (HLB) is necessary for an anticancer agent to be accumulated
inside the tumor cells in preference to the normal cells.28

The present work stems from our interests
to design oxidovanadium(IV) β-diketonates as targeted PDT agents
with ancillary dipicolylamine-based photosensitizers in a mixed-ligand
structure. The BODIPY (boron-dipyrromethene)-based ligands are suitable
as photosensitizers-cum-cellular imaging agents due to their tunable
photophysical properties that allow the emissive BODIPY moiety for
cellular imaging to probe the accumulation of the complex in any particular
organelle, while its non-emissive derivative can be used to produce
singlet oxygen as the reactive oxygen species in a high yield for
PDT activity.29,30 In addition, BODIPY dyes are
well documented for their mitochondrial localization ability.31−33 Even in hypoxic condition of tumor cells, BODIPY units with their
very high molar extinction coefficient values are efficient photosensitizers
inducing apoptotic cell death.34,35 The BODIPY dyes are
also well known to possess low dark toxicity as they are redox stable
within the biological potential window.29,35 Besides the
high molar extinction coefficient values, these dyes have sharp emission
bands with minimal Stokes shift and excellent photostability. They
can be synthetically fine-tuned to be either an imaging agent or as
a PDT agent. However, to enhance their aqueous solubility and tumor
selectivity, transition metal complexes with desirable photochemical
and photophysical properties are reported as the potential PDT agents.
With these characteristics, the highly emissive BODIPY complexes are
extensively used for cellular uptake and imaging studies, while other
complexes having BODIPY units with heavy atom(s) as photosensitizers
are used for PDT activity in visible light (400–700 nm).

Herein, we report the synthesis, structural characterization, and
PDT activity in cancer cells of a series of mixed-ligand oxidovanadium(IV)
complexes of β-diketones having a tridentate dipicolylamine
(dpa) ligand with pendant non-iodinated (L1) and di-iodinated
(L2) boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moieties, specifically,
[VO(L1)(acac)]Cl (1), [VO(L2)(acac)]Cl
(2), and [VO(L1)(dbm)]Cl (3),
where acac and dbm are monoanionic forms of acetylacetone and 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione
(dibenzoylmethane), respectively (Figure 1). The choice of 3d1-oxidovanadium(IV)
moiety as a linker of the photosensitizer and the diketonate group
is based on its redox inactivity within the biological potential window
when compared to its redox active 3d9-Cu2+ analogue,
which is known to display undesirable dark cellular toxicity.36 The salient features of this work are as follows:
(i) structural characterization of two mixed-ligand BODIPY complexes
by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, (ii) significant mitochondrial
localization of the complexes, and (iii) remarkable PDT activity on
photoinduced generation of singlet oxygen (1O2) in visible light of 400–700 nm, causing apoptotic cell death.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The oxidovanadium(IV) complexes 1–3 were synthesized in good yield (∼75%)
from a general method in which vanadyl sulfate was reacted initially
with barium chloride in aqueous ethanol (1:5 v/v), and the filtrate
on removal of insoluble barium sulfate was subsequently treated with
an ethanol solution of the deprotonated β-diketone ligand followed
by treatment of a solution of the tridentate dpa derivative (L1 or L2) in dichloromethane to obtain a dark precipitate
of the product (Figure 1). The complexes were characterized from spectral and analytical
data. Selected physicochemical data are given in Table 1. The mass spectra of the complexes
showed respective single ion peak assignable to [M – Cl]+ in MeOH (Figures S1–S3).
The complexes are 1:1 electrolytic giving molar conductivity values
of ∼68 S cm2 mol–1 in DMF at 25
°C.37 They are one-electron paramagnetic
with effective magnetic moment values of ∼1.65 μB at 298 K, indicating the 3d1 electronic configuration
of the metal. Characteristic C=O stretching (from β-diketonate)
and V=O stretching were observed in the FT-IR spectra of the
complexes at ∼1592 and ∼972 cm–1,
respectively (Figures S4–S6). Aromatic
C=N stretching was at ∼1610 cm–1.
The B–F stretching was also identified for the complexes at
∼1523 cm–1 assignable to the BODIPY core.
Cyclic voltammetry of the complexes showed irreversible reductive
response within −1.0 to −1.3 V versus SCE (saturated
calomel electrode) in DMF with 0.1 M [Bun4N](ClO4) (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte
assignable to the V(IV)–V(III) reduction couple (Figures S7–S9). Additionally, a BODIPY-based
reduction peak was observed near −1.06 V for 1 and 3, while the diiodo-BODIPY based peak appeared
near −0.80 V in complex 2. The dbm ligand in 3 showed a reduction peak at −1.63 V. The complexes
did not show any oxidative responses, indicating the redox stability
within the biological potential window. This is expected to reduce
any dark toxicity arising from the chemical nuclease activity of the
complexes in the presence of glutathione (GSH) inside the cells.

The oxidovanadium(IV) complexes
displayed weak and broad d-d transition band near 735 nm in 10% DMSO–DPBS
medium (pH = 7.2) (Figure S10).38 The BODIPY-based intense π → π*
transition band was observed for complexes 1 and 3 at ∼501 nm, and a similar transition for complex 2 from the diiodo-BODIPY core appeared at a longer wavelength
of ∼535 nm (Figure 2a). The bands within 350–400 nm were originated from
both the β-diketonate ligand and from the LLCT (ligand–ligand
charge transfer) transitions.39 The non-iodo-BODIPY
complexes 1 and 3 were green emissive in
10% aqueous DMSO, giving emission maxima at ∼514 nm with a
moderate fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF) value of
∼0.1 on excitation at 470 nm (Figure 2b).40 Complex 2 having the diiodo-BODIPY unit was essentially non-emissive
(λF ≈ 557 nm) with a low ΦF value of ∼0.01 (λex = 510 nm) due to facilitated
effective intersystem crossing (ISC) in the presence of heavy iodine
atoms that has resulted in a shift of the weak emission band to the
longer wavelength.41 The emissive complexes 1 and 3 were suitable for cellular uptake and
co-localization studies using their emission spectral property in
flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. Complex 2 in the presence of the diiodo-BODIPY unit as a photosensitizer
was used for the PDT study in visible light (400–700 nm). The
complexes having the oxophilic oxidovanadium(IV) core are known to
bind strongly to the O,O-donor β-diketonate ligands.29a Mixed-ligand complexes 1 and 3 were found to be fairly stable in 10% DMSO–DPBS medium
(pH = 7.2) up to 48 h. The diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 was
observed to be relatively less stable than its non-iodo BODIPY analogues.
This instability is ascribed to the attachment of two iodine atoms
in ligand L2 which was found to be less photostable than
the non-iodo ligand L1 (Figures S11–S15). Overall, the complexes exhibited good photostability with >70%
even for complex 2 for a photoirradiation duration of
1 h in broad band visible light of 400–700 nm (Luzchem Photoreactor,
10 J cm–2 power). The diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 was found to be more photostable than the ligand (L2) itself under same experimental conditions.

medium (pH = 7.2). (b) Emission spectra of the complexes 1–3 in 10% aqueous DMSO (λex =

X-ray Crystallography
Two BODIPY complexes, namely, [VO(L1)(acac)](PF6) (1a) and [VO(L2)(acac)](PF6) (2a) as PF6 salts, were structurally characterized
by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method.42−44 ORTEP views
of the cationic complexes are shown in Figure 3. Selected bond distances and angles of the
complexes are given in Table 2. Complex 1a crystalized in orthorhombic space
group Pbca with eight molecules (Z = 8) in the unit cell, while complex 2a crystallized
in triclinic space group of P1̅ with a Z value of 2. The mixed-ligand structures of the complexes
have a distorted octahedral geometry with a VO3N3 core. The tridentate chelating ligands L1 for 1a or L2 for 2a, using their N,N,N-donor dipicolylamine
(dpa)-based binding sites, are bonded to the oxidovanadium(IV) unit
in a facial manner, and the enolic tautomeric form of the monoanionic
acetylacetonate (acac) ligand is attached in a O,O-bidentate chelating
binding mode. The complexes are mono-cationic with the hexafluorophosphate
acting as a counteranion. The V–O(acac) bond distance is ∼1.98
Å. The V–N bond lengths are longer, ranging within 2.10
to 2.36 Å. The V=O bonds are of 1.599(2) and 1.625(13)
Å in 1a and 2a, respectively. The central
amine nitrogen of the dpa moiety of L1 and L2 with sp3 hybridization is positioned trans to the V=O
moiety, giving a longer V–N distance of ∼2.36 Å
due to the trans effect. The structural data are similar to other
reported mixed-ligand oxidovanadium(IV) complexes with V=O
distances ranging within 1.56–1.63 Å in a distorted octahedral
geometry and a VIVO3N3 core (vide Table S1 for details).29a,45,46 The angular disposition of the BODIPY unit
with the −C6H4– linker reduces
the effective conjugation between two units.

The boron atom was found to lie within the dipyrrin
plane and adopts a tetrahedral geometry in both 1a and 2a giving the N–B–N angles of 107.02(3)°
and 110.49(14)°, respectively, while the respective
F–B–F angles are 108.57(3)° and 107.29(14)°,
respectively. The dihedral angles between the BODIPY unit and the
phenyl ring were 76.86° and 91.41° for 1a and 2a, respectively. The angles between two moieties linked by
CH2 involving the dipicolylamine (dpa) and 4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (for 1a) or 4,4-difluoro-2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4
bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (for 2a)
units were observed to be 115.89° and 111.98°, respectively.

Theoretical Studies
Time-dependent density functional theory
(TD-DFT) and DFT studies were made to understand the electronic spectral
data of the complexes 1–3 using the
B3LYP level of theory with 6-311G+* (for C, H, N, O, B, and F) and
Lanl2DZ (for V and I atoms) basis sets by the Gaussian 09 program
(Tables S2–S4).47−49 The coordinates
obtained from the crystal structures of 1a and 2a were used for the geometrical optimization of the complexes.
The optimized structures and the FMOs (frontier molecular orbitals)
are shown in Figure 4. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) is exclusively situated
on the BODIPY core for complexes 1 and 3 and on the diiodo-BODIPY core for 2. In contrast, the
LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) is located on the VO2+ moiety and the β-diketonate ligand (acac for 1 and 2 and dbm for 3). The difference
in energy between the FMOs for the complexes is ∼2.22 eV. The
VIV–O distances of ∼1.98 Å and VIV=O distance of ∼1.61 Å are in good agreement
with the bond distances obtained from the crystal structures.

Figure 4 Optimized structures
of the complexes 1–3 and the FMOs.

TD-DFT (solvent model: IEFPCM; solvent: DMSO) calculations
for the complexes indicate a BODIPY-based strong transition (HOMO
→ LUMO+1) at ∼475 nm for 1 and 3 with oscillator strength values of 0.83 and 0.55, respectively (Tables S5–S7). A similar transition for
the diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 was obtained at ∼496
nm with an oscillator strength value of 0.52. These transitions correspond
to the experimentally observed band at ∼501 nm for 1 and 3 and at ∼535 nm for 2. The
transitions within 350–380 nm were found to be originated from
the β-diketonate ligand and BODIPY → β-diketonate
ILCT transitions. Amolev’s rule (intersystem crossing quantum
yield, ΦISC = 1 – ΦF) predicts
that the complexes 1 and 3 should possess
an ΦISC of ∼0.90, while complex 2 having heavy iodine atoms is expected to have the value of ∼0.99.50 The presence of diiodo-BODIPY ligand L2 in complex 2 favors spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a
significant manner and hence enhanced the triplet state population
due to “heavy atom effect”.51

Moreover, the energy difference between the ground doublet
(D0) and the first excited triplet (T1) state
of the complexes 1–3 were found to
be 1.59, 1.76, and 1.59 eV, respectively, which are considerably higher
than the required excitation energy of molecular oxygen (3Σg– → 1Δg, ΔE = 1.06 eV) to generate singlet oxygen (1O2). The complexes thus have the potential to act as type-II PDT agents
in visible light.

Singlet Oxygen as a ROS
Singlet
oxygen (1O2) as a reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generated from a type-II mechanistic pathway is of importance in PDT.1,2,7 Other ROS, like hydroxyl radical
(·OH), superoxide (O2·–) or peroxide (O22–), generated by a type-I and/or photo-redox pathway,
could be scavenged under physiological conditions by different enzymatic
systems, namely, by superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and peroxidase.
Since 1O2 could not be degraded in enzymatic
pathways in the human body, it is considered as the most lethal cytotoxic
agent. To ascertain the formation of singlet oxygen (1O2), titration experiments using 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF)
as a scavenger of 1O2 were performed. The decay
in the absorbance intensity value at the DPBF-based λmax of ∼417 nm, due to endoperoxide formation, was examined with
different photoirradiation times in the light of 400–700 nm
(dose = 10 J cm–2) in the presence of constant concentration
of the complexes (molar ratio of DPBF:complex = 50:1). The self-degradation
possibility of DPBF was overruled as the control experiments in the
absence of the complexes did not show any significant change in the
absorbance value of DPBF. It was observed that in the presence of
the complexes, the intensity at the absorption maximum at ∼417
nm gets reduced in a linear fashion with respect to the photoirradiation
time (Figure 5). No
thermal recovery of DPBF was noticed within the time span of the experiment.

Figure 5 (a) Absorption
spectral traces of DPBF and complex 2 on exposure to
light (400–700 nm, 10 J cm–2) for each exposure time of 15 s. (b) Plot showing changes in absorbance
of DPBF at 417 nm with time on light exposure with 1–3 (color code: 1, black; 2, red; 3, blue). A higher slope for complex 2 indicates a significant
quantity of singlet oxygen (1O2) generation.

The first-order decay constants
were evaluated in the presence of different complexes, and the values
are 6.31 × 10–4, 7.93 × 10–3, and 1.11 × 10–3 for 1–3, respectively, giving an order 2 ≫ 3 > 1. The half-life time for the decay was also estimated
to be 1098, 87, and 624 s for 1–3, respectively
(Figure S16). The singlet oxygen quantum
yield (ΦΔ) values for the complexes were measured
using Rose Bengal (RB) as a standard (ΦΔ =
0.76 in DMSO) and keeping the optical density (O.D.) for RB or the
complexes very low (O.D. of ∼0.1) to avoid any quenching of 1O2 by RB or the complexes.29,30 Singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ) values
for the complexes are 0.14, 0.47, and 0.18 for 1–3, respectively, while the values are 0.20 and 0.88 for L1 and L2, respectively.52 Complex 2 with a diiodo-BODIPY unit with a moderately high quantum
yield (ΦΔ) generates a significant quantity
of singlet oxygen (Figure S17). Having
medium (for 1 and 3) to high (for 2) singlet oxygen generation efficiency, complex 2 is a potential type-II PDT agent, while the non-iodo BODIPY complexes
with relatively low ΦΔ values are suitable
for cellular imaging study.

Lipophilicity
Lipophilicity of a
drug molecule is important for its absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (ADME) profile for being absorbed by gastrointestinal
tract (GIT) and hepatocytes.53 In addition,
it is known to support passive diffusion through blood–brain–barrier
(BBB). To estimate lipophilicity of the complexes, octanol–water
partition coefficients (P) were determined using
the shake-flask method. Complex 3 having a 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedionate
ligand was found to be the most lipophilic with a log P value of 1.56(±0.06). The observed order of lipophilicity for
the complexes is 3 > 2 > 1 (Table 1 and Figures S18 and S19). Since BODIPY-appended L1 ligand is invariant for 1 and 3, the difference in their log P values is attributed
to the lipophilicity difference in the β-diketonate ligands.
The log P values for the diketonate ligands follow
the order dbm > acac. As expected, complex 2 having
the diiodo-BODIPY unit is found to have a log P value
greater than complex 1 with a non-iodo-BODIPY moiety.
The most lipophilic complex is 3 with a dibenzoylmethane
ligand with two pendant phenyl groups, that is, a ligand with high
lipophilicity is found to possess a high log P value.

Cell Viability
The efficacy and selectivity of the complexes 1–3 as anticancer agents were verified
by in vitro cell viability assay, viz., MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) assay, using cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells in the absence
of light and on photoexposure with a visible light source (400–700
nm; Luzchem photoreactor, total dose = 10 J cm–2; irradiation time of 1 h). The complexes were incubated for 4 h
and then exposed to visible light. Another set was used as dark controls
to compare the effect of light activation on the complexes. The complexes
were generally less toxic (half maximal inhibitory concentration,
IC50 > 100 μM for 1 and 3; ∼60 μM for 2) when kept in the dark,
whereas they show significant photocytotoxicity on light activation
(Figure S20). The IC50 values
of 1–3 in HeLa cells are 12.5, 1.1, and 6.3 μM,
respectively, giving an order [VO(L2)(acac)]Cl (2) > [VO(L1)(dbm)]Cl (3) > [VO(L1)(acac)]Cl (1) (Table 3).29a,d,54,55 The diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 was found
to give a good phototoxic index (PI) value of >50. A comparison
of the activity between complexes having L1 and L2 ligands indicates that the diiodo-BODIPY ligand acts as a better
photosensitizer-cum-lipophilic moiety than the non-BODIPY ligand.
The difference between complexes 1 and 3 is due to the higher lipophilic nature of dpm than acac.

The pathway of cell death
for HeLa with complex 2 (1 μM) was found to be
apoptotic in nature from the Annexin V-FITC and PI assay (Figure S21). HeLa cells treated with complex 2 with subsequent 1 h photoirradiation showed ∼33%
apoptotic death of total population (18% in early apoptotic stage
and 15% in late apoptotic stage), while the necrotic death population
was found to be ∼21%. Again, when one set of the HeLa cells
was incubated with the non-emissive diiodo-BODIPY complex 2 (1 μM) for 4 h in the dark, confocal microscopic images with
nuclear straining Hoechst 33342 dye did not show any abnormal morphological
changes. However, when HeLa cells were incubated for 4 h with complex 2 (1 μM) and photoirradiated for 1 h (400–700
nm, Luzchem photoreactor, total dose = 10 J cm–2), it showed significant nuclear membrane blebbing, indicating its
fragmentation, which corresponds to initiation of apoptosis (Figure S22). To analyze the trend in the IC50 values, the cellular uptake of the emissive complexes 1 and 3 in HeLa cells was estimated using flow
cytometry. It was found that incorporation of complex 3 having the dbm ligand was higher as compared to that of the acac
complex 1 (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Flow cytometric overlay plot showing the uptake of the complexes 1–3 in HeLa cells after 4 h incubation.

The higher cellular uptake of dbm complex 3 is mainly due to its lipophilicity property. Hence, the
IC50 values of 1 and 3 are in
good agreement with their rate of incorporation inside the cancer
cells. However, the non-emissive complex 2 was found
to supersede the rest of the complexes in its photocytotoxicity probably
due to its distinctly higher singlet oxygen generation efficiency
with a high singlet oxygen quantum yield (ΦΔ) in addition to its lipophilicity as mentioned above.

Subcellular
Localization
The HeLa cells were incubated with the emissive
dbm complex 3 (2 μM, ΦF = 0.09)
for 4 h in the dark after which the cells were processed, and confocal
microscopic images were captured. To ascertain any nuclear localization
of complex 3, confocal microscopic images were taken
using a nuclear staining Hoechst 33342 dye, which displayed blue fluorescence
(λex = 350 nm; λem = 460 nm) in
contrast to the green emissive BODIPY complexes (λex = 470 nm; λem = 514 nm). The results showed predominant
cytoplasmic localization of the complexes from the overlay of the
images (Figure 7).
Further organelle specific localization study was performed using
Mito Tracker Deep Red (MTR) as a mitochondrion staining dye. The merged
images revealed significant mitochondrial localization of the complex
with a co-localization coefficient value of ∼0.7.

DNA Binding and Cleavage
Since the complexes were found
to significantly localize in the mitochondria of the cells, mito-DNA
could be their probable target. Thus, the binding propensity of the
complexes 1–3 with calf thymus (ct)
DNA was studied from UV–visible absorption spectral experiments.
The complexes showed partial intercalative mode of binding with ct-DNA
with intrinsic binding constant (Kb) values
in the order of ∼105 M–1 in 5%
DMF–Tris buffer (pH = 7.2). The binding strength follows the
order [VO(L1)(dbm)]Cl (3) > [VO(L1)(acac)]Cl (1) > [VO(L2)(acac)]Cl (2) (Table 1 and Figures S23 and S24). DNA binding
properties of the complexes were also studied from competitive ethidium
bromide (EB) displacement assay using the emission quenching method.
The Kapp values of the complexes 1–3 gave a similar order as observed from
the Kb values (Table 1 and Figures S25 and S26). Binding propensity of the complexes with ct-DNA was studied
in DMF–Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 7.2) using the viscometric titration
method at 37 °C, and (η/η0)1/3 versus [Complex]/[DNA] plots were compared with standard DNA intercalator
ethidium bromide and standard groove binder Hoechst dye (Figure S27). The binding trend of the complexes
was found to be similar to the one observed by other methods.56,57

DNA photocleavage activity of the complexes 1–3 and the ligands (L1 and L2) was studied using 10 μM concentration of each sample with
appropriate dark controls using supercoiled (SC) pUC19 DNA (30 μM,
0.2 μg) in Tris-HCl/NaCl (50 mM, pH = 7.2) buffer (Figure S28).58,59 Gel electrophoresis
in agarose gel was carried out to estimate the amount of nicked circular
(NC) DNA generation from the SC DNA on treatment of the complexes
and the BODIPY ligands. A monochromatic green light source of 532
nm was used from a CW (continuous-wave) diode laser (100 mW laser
power) for light irradiation. The wavelength selection for this study
was based on the presence of the electronic spectral bands at ∼501
nm for 1 and 3 and 535 nm for 2. Each sample was subjected to 1 h photoirradiation after treatment
with the DNA solution in Tris-HCl buffer and incubation for 1 h in
the dark. The complexes and ligands (10 μM) exhibited negligible
DNA cleavage activity (≤10% NC) in the absence of light, while
generation of ∼15 and ∼50% of NC DNA was detected in
the photoirradiated complexes having L1 and L2, respectively. However, the β-diketone ligands alone did not
show any apparent DNA photocleavage activity. Complexes 1 and 2 showed ∼45% and 3 as ∼30%
of NC DNA, thus giving an order 2 ≈ 1 > 3 (Figure S28). The DNA photocleavage activity of the non-iodo
BODIPY complexes is similar to the diiodo-analogue, indicating the
importance of the bulk of the BODIPY ligands in DNA cleavage activity.
The ROS generation by complex 2 in the photo-triggered
condition was also verified in HeLa cells by DCFDA assay (Figure S29).

The nature of ROS was ascertained
from the DNA photocleavage mechanistic data using the diiodo-BODIPY
complex 2 (10 μM) and different singlet oxygen quenchers and
hydroxyl and other radical scavengers (Figure S30). A marginal enhanced percentage of NC DNA was observed
in D2O in which singlet oxygen has a longer lifetime. In
contrast, addition of TEMP and NaN3 as singlet oxygen quenchers
significantly reduced the percentage of NC DNA. Addition of DMSO,
KI, or catalase as a radical scavenger did not show any apparent change
in the NC DNA percentage. A similar result was obtained on addition
of SOD. The percentage of NC DNA diminished to a negligible value
when the experiment was carried out in an argon atmosphere, thus indicating
involvement of oxygen (3O2) for the DNA photocleavage
activity. The mechanistic data indicate generation of singlet oxygen
as the sole reactive oxygen species (ROS). This observation is of
importance as photofrin is also known to generate only singlet oxygen
as the ROS in the PDT process and not any other radical species.

Conclusions
Mixed-ligand oxidovanadium(IV) complexes of
monoanionic β-diketone and dipicolylamine (dpa) ligands having
two pendant photoactive BODIPY moieties are designed and prepared
for targeted PDT activity with the complexes showing significant visible
light-induced (400–700 nm,10 J cm–2) cytotoxicity
in HeLa cervical cancer cells while being less active in the dark.
Two BODIPY complexes are structurally characterized by single-crystal
X-ray crystallography. The complexes having a green-emissive BODIPY
moiety exhibited predominant subcellular mitochondrial accumulation
and considerable uptake inside the cancer cells. The non-emissive
diiodo-BODIPY complex as a photosensitizer showed a high singlet oxygen
quantum yield and remarkable PDT activity. Apoptotic cell death of
the HeLa cancer cells in presence of complex 2 was due
to the formation of singlet oxygen species as evidenced from the annexin-V
assay, and the nature of ROS was evidenced from the mechanistic data
from the pUC19 DNA photocleavage study and DPBF titrations. Complex 2 having a diiodo-BODIPY ligand is found to be an excellent
PDT agent with a good photocytotoxic index (PI) value of >50 (IC50 in the dark: 58.0 μM, IC50 in the light:
1.1 μM). Vanadium being a biocompatible metal ion, complex 2 having a lipophilic diiodo-BODIPY unit as a photosensitizer
is a potential metal-based photodynamic therapy agent.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Methods
The chemicals and reagents were
purchased from standard commercial sources. Solvents used were purified
and distilled by standard methods.60 Synthesis
of the complexes was carried out in a N2 atmosphere utilizing
the Schlenk technique. The chemical reagents, trackers, dyes, DNA,
and buffer for DNA binding, photocleavage, and cellular experiments
were also procured from standard commercial sources (vide ref29a for details). The BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)-appended dipicolylamine (L1) and
diiodo-BODIPY (4,4-difluoro-2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene)-appended dipicolylamine (L2) were
prepared by literature procedures.61,62 Acetylacetone
(Hacac) and 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione (Hdbm) were procured from
Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was synthesized
using tetrabutylammonium bromide and perchloric acid. TBAP was used
in a small quantity with care (caution!).

Electrospray ionization
(ESI) mass spectral measurements and elemental analysis data of 1–3 were obtained using a model 6538 UHD
Accurate-mass Q-TOF LC/MS ESI mass spectrometer from Agilent Technologies
and Thermo Finnigan FLASH EA 1112 CHNS analyzer, respectively. The
electronic spectra (UV–vis) and infrared spectra were recorded
with Perkin-Elmer spectrum one 55 and Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 spectrometer,
respectively, at ambient temperature. Fluorescence measurements were
performed using a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer. A
relative method, as described in the literature, was used to measure
the fluorescence quantum yield values of the compounds.63 A Control Dynamics (India) conductivity meter
was used for molar conductivity measurements. Magnetic susceptibility
was obtained using a magnetic susceptibility balance (Sherwood Scientific).
Diamagnetic corrections were done using a literature report.64 Electrochemical measurements were performed
at room temperature using an EG&G PAR model 253 VersaStat potentiostat/galvanostat.
Electrochemical analysis software 270 was used. A three-electrode
setup of a glassy carbon working, platinum wire auxiliary, and a saturated
calomel reference electrode (SCE) in DMF–0.1 M TBAP was used.
Flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopic measurements were
carried out using FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) Calibur
Becton Dickinson (BD) cell analyzer at FL2 channel (595 nm) and ApoTome.2
fluorescence microscope, respectively.

Synthesis of [VO(L1/L2)(acac/dbm)]Cl (1–3)
To prepare the complexes, vanadyl sulfate (0.16
g, 1.0 mmol) and barium chloride (0.24 g, 1.0 mmol) were initially
dissolved in 18 mL of aqueous ethanol (EtOH:H2O = 5:1 v/v).
The mixture that was stirred at room temperature for 3 h in a nitrogen
atmosphere was filtered to discard the white barium sulfate as the
precipitate. The blue colored filtrate was deaerated and then saturated
with N2. A deaerated ethanol solution (10 mL) of Hacac
(0.10 g, 1.0 mmol) was slowly added to this filtrate for complexes 1 and 2 and Hdbm (0.22 g, 1.0 mmol) for 3, which was previously deprotonated with Et3N
(0.10 g, 1.0 mmol) for the enolic forms. A deep green solution thus
formed, after stirring the mixture for 30 min, was reacted with the
CH2Cl2 solution (10 mL) of L1 (0.54
g, 1.0 mmol) for 1 and 3 or L2 (0.79 g, 1.0 mmol) for 2. The product got precipitated
out of the solution spontaneously on stirring for 2 h. The reddish
brown solid was filtered and then isolated followed by washing with
cold EtOH, CH2Cl2, and Et2O. It was
finally dried in vacuum in a desiccator over P4O10.

Solubility
The complexes showed good solubility in common
organic solvents, namely, EtOH, MeOH, MeCN, DMSO, and DMF. They were
moderately soluble in chlorinated solvents (chloroform and dichloromethane)
and insoluble in hydrocarbon solvents and diethyl ether. The complexes
as their chloride salts showed good aqueous solubility (∼150
μM in 99:1 v/v DPBS:DMSO) and hence were suitable for anticancer
activity studies.

X-ray Crystallographic Method
The
methanol solution of [VO(L1)(acac)]Cl (1)
and the acetonitrile solution of [VO(L2)(acac)]Cl (2) were treated with NH4PF6 to isolate
the complexes as their hexafluorophosphate salts (1a and 2a) in crystalline forms as attempts to isolate the single
crystals of the chloride salts were unsuccessful. The crystal structures
of [VO(L1)(acac)]PF6 (1a) and [VO(L2)(acac)]PF6 (2a) were obtained by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction method.46−48 Single crystals
of 1a were obtained upon slow evaporation of the 1:3
MeOH/CHCl3 (v/v) solution of the complex, whereas single
crystals of 2a were obtained from diethyl ether vapor
diffusion into the acetonitrile solution of the complex. Among the
crystals, a crystal of suitable quality and dimensions was mounted
on a crystal mounting loop with paratone oil. The intensity data were
collected using graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (0.7107
Å) at 100 K for 1a and 293 K for 2a. The structures of 1a and 2a were solved
in Pbca and P1̅ space group
of orthorhombic and triclinic crystal system with Z values of 8 and 2, respectively. The structures solved by direct
methods using SHELXL-2014 incorporated in WinGX (Version 1.63.04a)
exhibited no abnormality in the core molecular structure of the complexes.
The high R-indices (all data) for 2a were due to poor quality of the diffraction data. Reflections collected/Unique
are 8862/5563 for complex 1a and 8784/2608 for complex 2a (vide Table S8 in the Supporting Information). All atoms barring the hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically
for complex 1a. Due to a low data-to-parameter ratio,
only few nonhydrogen atoms for 2a were refined anisotropically.
The hydrogen atoms were refined using a riding model. An analysis
of the data indicated that the reduced number of unique reflections
for 2a was due to photodegradation of its crystals on
exposure to X-ray radiation during data collection (vide Figures S12 and S14 in the Supporting Information). The data-to-parameter ratio for this structure was not suitable
enough to refine all nonhydrogen atoms anisotropically. This constraint
led to the A-alert in the checkCIF(PLATON) file for 2a. The molecular structure obtained from the available data did not
show any abnormal structural features and compare well with that of 1a. The atomic coordinates were successfully used to obtain
the energy minimized structure of this complex for the photophysical
studies to interpret the spectral data. Selected crystallographic
parameters are given in Table S8. The CCDC
deposition numbers are 1815715 and 1815716.

Theoretical Method
The geometric optimization of the complexes were performed by hybrid
density functional theory (DFT) using the B3LYP level of theory with
6-311G+* (for C, H, N, O, B, and F) and Lanl2DZ (for V and I) basis
sets by the Gaussian 09 program.51−53 The coordinates were
initially acquired from the crystal structures of the complexes 1a and 2a. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) was employed
to obtain the electronic transitions. The optimized coordinates and
the electronic transitions are given in Tables S2 and S4–S7 (see the Supporting Information).

Partition
Coefficient Determination
The shake-flask method was used
to perform the experiment. At first, the absorbance calibration curve
was prepared for the complex under examination using different concentrations
of the complexes in the aqueous medium. Then, known concentrations
of the aqueous solutions of the complexes were mixed in vessels with
the same volume of analytical grade n-octanol. After
shaking the mixture well at room temperature for 4 h, it was allowed
to settle down. Two phases got separated, and the remaining concentration
of the complex in the aqueous phase was determined by using the previously
prepared calibration curve.

DNA Binding and Cleavage Experiments
UV–visible spectral studies were performed to measure the
DNA binding constants of the complexes using calf thymus (ct) DNA
following reported methods.56,57 DNA binding by the
ethidium bromide (EB) displacement method and viscosity method were
also carried out (vide the Supporting Information). A Schott Gerate AVS310 automated viscometer fitted with a thermostatic
bath of 37 °C was used. The details on photocleavage experiments
are given in the Supporting Information.
