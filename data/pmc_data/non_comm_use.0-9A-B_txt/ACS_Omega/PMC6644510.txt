Degrading organic dyes via catalytic
processes for waste water purification is an important research topic
from the environmental conservation point of view. Herein, the catalytic
performance of tungsten blue oxide (WOx) nanoparticles was investigated systematically by varying the reduction
temperature. The optimum reduction temperature to obtain the most
stable WOx phase was obtained when plasma-synthesized
WO3 nanoparticles were thermally reduced at 425 °C.
The as-synthesized nanoparticles had an average diameter of 10 nm
and a calculated band gap of 2.37 eV, which is lower than that of
the WO3 nanoparticles (2.61 eV). The WOx nanoparticles exhibited an excellent performance in degrading
rhodamine B under dark conditions and visible light irradiation, with
a reaction rate constant 93 times higher than that of the WO3 nanoparticles.

Introduction
In the
past decade, tungsten oxide (WO3) nanoparticles (NPs) have
attracted much attention as an efficient material for photocatalysis,
phototherapy, and electrochemical applications, due to their favorable
physical and chemical properties.1−4 Their relatively narrow
band gap of 2.6–3.0 eV allows for excitation by visible wavelengths,
which is desirable for photocatalysis applications.5,6 The
favorable surface interaction between tungsten oxide and organic dye
molecules also makes it a good adsorbent.7 The interaction between dye molecules and WO3 nanosheet
surfaces has been reported previously. WO3 NPs in the form
of films or nanosheets were used as adsorbents, and exhibited selective
adsorption properties, though the amount of adsorbed material was
not high.8 Another report proposed the
structuration of WO3 NPs to enhance their surface area,
which improved their adsorption properties and photocatalytic performance.9,10

A nonstoichiometric phase of WO3 known as tungsten
blue oxide (WOx) NPs has recently received
much interest. The presence of oxygen vacancies within its structure
provides several advantages compared to WO3.11,12 For example, oxygen vacancies in the transition-metal oxide figuratively
act as dopants, which decreases the band gap in a way similar to the
addition of Pt onto TiOx NPs.13,14 Hence, an intrinsic semiconductor can be converted to a hypothetically
extrinsic semiconductor with a donor activation energy at 0.01 eV.11 WOx NPs also have
the ability to generate free electrons (N ∼
1021 cm–3).12

Numerous approaches have been developed for synthesis of WOx NPs, including approaches based on supercritical
fluid, sol gel, hydrothermal, and chemical vapor deposition methods.15−17 WOx particles can reportedly be produced by heating ammonium paratungstate
[(NH4)10(H2W12O42)·4H2O] for several hours, which is feasible for
industrial-scale applications.18 The use
of WOx particles in various forms and
morphologies, such as Ag/WOx nanorods,
WOx–TiO2 composites,
WOx/C nanocomposites, and WOx nanorods, for photocatalytic application has been
previously reported.12,19−21 Such reports have shown that other than
the presence of an additional dopant or cocatalyst, increasing the
amount of oxygen vacancies inside the crystal structure could improve
the photocatalytic performance. However, most resulting products were
reportedly larger than 100 nm. Nanosized particles (i.e., smaller
than 100 nm) are preferred because higher specific surface area gives
them higher activity. To the best of our knowledge, there are still
no reports on synthesis of WOx NPs smaller
than 100 nm via thermal reduction methods at reduction temperatures
in the range of 300–700 °C. Furthermore, there are also
no reports regarding the effect of reduction temperature on their
catalytic performances under dark condition and light irradiation
for organic dye degradation.

In the current study, WOx NPs were synthesized from plasma-synthesized
WO3 NPs (average diameter of 6 nm) via a thermal reduction
process under 100% H2 gas inside an electric furnace. The
effect of the reduction temperature on the physicochemical properties
of the resulting WOx NPs, including size,
specific surface area, and band gap value, was investigated systematically.
The degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) under dark conditions and visible
light irradiation was studied to evaluate the adsorption and photocatalytic
performance of the as-synthesized WOx NPs.

Results and Discussion
Effect of Reduction Temperature
Figure 1 shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and
digital photographs of the plasma-synthesized WO3 NPs and
WOx NPs synthesized under reduction temperatures
ranging from 100 to 700 °C for 1 h. The XRD pattern of the pale
green WO3 NPs could be assigned to the monoclinic crystal
structure based on PDF no. 43-1035. The main diffraction peaks at
2θ = 24.2, 26.7, and 34.0° corresponded to the ⟨020⟩,
⟨200⟩, and ⟨202⟩ planes, respectively.
Similar XRD patterns were observed for the WOx NPs reduced at 100–300 °C. However, the color of the
WOx NPs gradually changed from green to
bluish green to teal blue. The change in color was caused by oxygen
loss within the crystal structure, which led to a change in the W
valence state. During reduction, some of the initial W6+ were reduced to W5+ and W4+, which were responsible
for the color change of the NPs.5,22−24

Figure 1 XRD patterns and digital photographs of the WO3 NPs
and WOx NPs reduced at different temperatures
for 1 h under a H2 gas atmosphere.

WO2.9 NPs with
a navy-blue color were obtained when the WO3 NPs were reduced
at 400 °C. The XRD pattern was consistent with PDF no. 05-0386
of the monoclinic WO2.9 crystal structure. As discussed
above, the darkening of the WOx NP color
was associated with an increase in the amount of oxygen deficiencies.
More oxygen vacancies within the crystal structure resulted in darker
particles. When the reduction temperature was increased to 500 °C,
the dominant phase of the WOx NPs was
WO3 monoclinic crystal structure. A weak peak of WO2.9 monoclinic crystal structure was still observed, as well
as new broad peaks at 2θ of 40–55°. The color of
the WOx (500 °C) NPs was peacock
blue violet. The broad peaks could be assigned to a set of complex
structures of different phases of WOx NPs
that were hard to distinguish. WO3 monoclinic peaks were
observed because the NPs had a very active surface, which rapidly
oxidized when exposed to the atmosphere. When reduced at 700 °C,
NPs with a black color were obtained. The XRD pattern showed that
the WOx (700 °C) NPs were pure W
metal, and that the WO3 NPs had been over reduced.

Figure 2 shows transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the WO3 NPs and WOx NPs synthesized under different reduction temperatures
for 1 h. Figure 2a
shows the pristine WO3 NPs, which had an average diameter
(dp) of 6 nm. Increasing the reduction
temperature from 100 to 500 °C yielded monodisperse WOx NPs with dp values
of 7–11 nm, respectively, as shown in Figure 2b–f. Figure 2g shows a TEM image of the sample prepared
at 700 °C, in which the NPs were sintered with a dp of approximately 20 nm.

WO3 NPs and
WOx NPs reduced at (b) 100 °C, (c)

(g) 700 °C. (h) Summary of the effect of reduction temperature
on particle size and specific surface area (SBET) of the WOx NPs. The particle
size and SBET of the WO3 NPs
were 6 nm and 71 m2 g–1, respectively.
The average particle diameters (dp) were
derived from topological measurements of more than 300 particles.

WO3 NPs reportedly
readily sinter at annealing temperatures higher than 300 °C.25 It was reported that when pure WO3 was reduced without hydrogen, the agglomeration of small tungsten
crystals occurred. However, during the reduction of WO3 to WOx in the current study, the crystal
transformation of WOx occurred simultaneously
with the depletion of oxygen from the surface layer. Oxygen vacancies
readily formed during the reduction of tungsten oxide under the hydrogen
atmosphere because the chemical potential of oxygen decreases significantly
at high temperature and low oxygen partial pressure.11 As a result, the size and shape of the original WO3 NPs were maintained in the WOx NPs. Specific surface areas (SBET) of
the NPs were calculated to further investigate the effect of reduction
temperature on sintering. SBET values
are shown in Figure 2h. The SBET of the WOx NPs was not significantly affected by reduction at temperatures
up to 500 °C. However, the SBET of
the WOx (700 °C) NPs was lower than
the others, further suggesting that the NPs sintered during heat treatment
at 700 °C.

The above results suggested that the reduction
of WO3 was a very sensitive process. WO3 NPs
were reduced to W metal at a relatively low temperature (700 °C)
and short reduction time (1 h). According to a previous study, the
phase transformation pathway is: WO3 → WO2.9 → WO2.7 → W.26,27 However, the
exact reduction temperature and time required to obtain these phases
depend on the synthesis method. In the current study, the reduction
temperature played an important role in producing WOx NPs. Though the change in crystal structure was not readily
apparent from the XRD patterns, differing amounts of oxygen vacancies
within the WOx structure were apparent
from the different colors of the NPs.

To further investigate
the effect of the reduction temperature on the WOx crystal structure, the reduction temperature was varied
over a narrower range of 400–475 °C. XRD patterns of WOx NPs synthesized under these reduction temperatures
are shown in Figure 3. A slight increase in reduction temperature changed the crystal
structure of the WOx NPs. As discussed
above, the crystal structure of the intermediate Magnéli phase
WO2.9 was observed following reduction at 400 °C.
NPs with a mixed WO2.0 (PDF no. 48-1827) and WO2.7 (PDF no. 36-101) structure were obtained following reduction at
425 °C. The WO2.0 phase was obtained following reduction
at 450 °C.

Figure 3 XRD patterns
of WOx NPs reduced at 400–475 °C
for 1
h under a H2 gas atmosphere.

After reduction at 475 °C, the surface
of the WOx NPs reoxidized when exposed
to open air. This was evidenced by the XRD pattern of the resulting
NPs corresponding to the WO3 monoclinic crystal structure.
This occurred because at this temperature the reduction proceeded
deeper into the bulk of the NPs, compared with reduction at lower
temperature. The high amount of oxygen vacancies and free electrons
made the NPs highly unstable and reactive to open air. TEM images
of WOx NPs synthesized at 400–475
°C are shown in Figure S1 (see Supporting
Information). The dp values of these NPs
were approximately 10–11 nm. This confirmed that the reduction
temperature affected the crystal structure more than the particle
morphology and size.

WO2.7 is the most stable phase
of WOx for many applications.11 However, it is difficult to obtain NPs of pure
WO2.7 phase because the conversion from WO3 to
WO2.0 is an extremely rapid reaction. In published studies,
identification of the WO2.7 phase was carried out solely
by observations of color.2,28

To understand
better about the crystal structure of the as-synthesized WOx NPs, a high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) imaging
analysis was carried out for several samples, and the obtained images
are shown in Figure 4. Figure 4a,b, which,
respectively, shows a lattice spacing of 3.92 Å for the WOx (300 °C) NPs and 3.91 Å for the WOx (400 °C) NPs, confirms that WO3 monoclinic crystal structure is still the dominant phase inside
the nanoparticles. However, WOx NPs reduced
at 425 °C (Figure 4c) were observed to have a narrower lattice spacing of around 3.59
Å and several displacements (marked by the green rectangle in
the picture), which confirmed the presence of WOx crystal structure as modeled in a previous study.29 When the WO3 NPs were reduced at
500 °C, the obtained crystal structure was irregular compared
to the other WOx NPs. This indicates that
the NPs were on their way to form another crystal structure because
of the increased amount of oxygen deficiencies compared to when reduced
at lower temperatures. However, it was not perfectly structured for
a reduction time of 1 h. This irregular structure might also be one
of the causes for the highly reactive behavior of the WOx (500 °C) NPs when exposed to open air.

Figure 4 High-resolution TEM (HR-TEM)
images for WOx NPs reduced at (a) 300
°C, (b) 400 °C,
(c) 425 °C, and (d) 500 °C.

The behavior of the W–O bonding under different reduction
temperatures was investigated by Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Figure S2. The results were in good agreement
with the XRD results (Figure 1), in which the WO3 NPs and WOx (300 °C) NPs had similar crystal structures from the
XRD patterns, but differed visually by their color. Furthermore, they
also confirmed that the number of oxygen deficiencies increased as
the reduction temperature increased. Detailed analysis of the Raman
spectroscopy results is available in the Supporting Information S2.

To investigate further the presence of
oxygen deficiencies inside the NP crystal structure, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out for binding energies
around O 1s orbital, and the results are shown in Figure S3 (Supporting Information). The peak intensity of
W–O bonding for WOx (300 °C)
was only 32.3% (relative to the total area for three peaks), which
is pretty small concerning the fact that the XRD result for this sample
showed a dominant WO3 phase. This indicates the presence
of oxygen deficiencies inside their structure. The intensity of the
W–O bonding peak became smaller for NPs reduced at 400 and
425 °C, which indicates that more oxygen deficiencies are present
inside their structure. However, the peak intensity for the W–O
bonding increased significantly for the WOx (500 °C) NPs, confirming that the particle surface was reoxidized
back to WO3 when exposed to ambient air.

Diffuse
reflectance measurements were carried out for the WO3 NPs
and WOx NPs reduced at 300, 400, 425,
500, and 700 °C, and the results are shown in Figure S6a. From each spectrum, a Tauc plot was derived using
the Kubelka–Munk correlation to calculate the band gap.30 The Tauc plot results are shown in Figure S6b, and the calculated band gaps are
summarized in Table 1. A detailed explanation of the method to estimate the band gap value
from the diffuse reflectance spectrum is available in the Supporting Information S4.

Table 1 Calculated Band Gaps of the WO3 NPs and WOx NPs Reduced at Different Temperatures
sample	band gap (eV)	
WO3	2.61	
WOx (300 °C)	2.62	
WOx (400 °C)	2.58	
WOx (425 °C)	2.37	
WOx (500 °C)	2.51	
WOx (700 °C)	nonea	
a The WOx (700 °C) NPs had no band gap because of their
complete reduction to W metal.

Table 1 shows that the reduction process
did not significantly change the band gap, except when the NPs were
reduced at 425 °C. The WOx (300 °C)
NPs had a band gap similar to that of the initial WO3 NPs.
The band gap of the WOx (400 °C)
NPs was slightly lower, and the value became much narrower when the
reduction temperature was 425 °C. This indicates that the band
gap became narrower due to the presence of free electrons in the d
orbitals of the reduced ions (W5+ or W4+), which
formed a band tail from the bottom of the conduction band. In the
case of the WOx (700 °C) NPs, no
band gap existed because the NPs were completely reduced to W metal,
whereas the band gap value of the WOx (500
°C) NPs was bigger than that of the one reduced at 425 °C
because their surface was oxidized back to WO3 as observed
before.

Degradation of RhB
Figure 5 shows the
degradation of RhB solution with an initial concentration of 12 mg
L–1 as a function of time over the WO3 NPs and WOx NPs reduced at different
temperatures. The degradation process of RhB, which includes adsorption
and photocatalysis processes, is shown in Figure 5a. Figure 5b shows a plot of their corresponding −ln(C/C0) values against the visible
light irradiation time. C and C0 represent the concentration of RhB solution at any given
time and its initial concentration, respectively.

Figure 5 (a) Degradation profiles
of RhB over the WO3 NPs and WOx NPs reduced at different
temperatures, in dark conditions and under visible light irradiation.
(b) Corresponding −ln(C/C0) versus irradiation time plots for measurements under
visible light irradiation. (c) Repeatability check for WOx (425 °C) NPs. Both measurements were carried
out with a time gap of 12 months. (d) Amount of RhB loss per catalyst
weight over three cycles of measurement. For each measurement, initial
concentration of RhB was 12 mg L–1 and observation
was carried out in dark conditions (3 h) and under visible light irradiation
(2 h).

Figure 5a shows that the adsorption–desorption
equilibriums of RhB in dark conditions over the WO3 NP
and WOx (300 °C) NP surfaces occurred
after approximately 10 min. The RhB concentration after measurement
for 3 h in dark conditions and 2 h under visible light irradiation
over the WOx (300 °C) NPs decreased
only slightly from that over the WO3 NPs. The corresponding
RhB concentrations were 93 and 96%. The rate constant (k) for the photodecomposition of RhB under visible light irradiation
by each sample was evaluated using simplified Langmuir–Hinshelwood
kinetics,30 and the results are shown in Figure 5b. The k values for the WO3 NPs and WOx (300 °C) NPs were 0.08 × 10–3 and 0.28
× 10–3 min–1, respectively.
These results were in good agreement with the XRD, Raman spectroscopy,
and band gap evaluation results, which showed no significant change
in the crystal structure and absorption properties when the WO3 NPs were reduced at 300 °C.

The WOx (400 °C) NPs showed higher adsorption and photocatalytic
performance, with remaining RhB concentrations of 74 and 66% after
measurement in dark conditions for 3 h and under visible light irradiation
for 2 h, respectively. The k value for this sample
was 1.48 × 10–3 min–1. The
degradation of RhB increased significantly when the WOx NPs were reduced at 425 °C. The remaining RhB
concentrations for these NPs were approximately 30 and 19% after measurements
in dark conditions and under visible light irradiation, respectively,
and the k value was 7.5 × 10–3 min–1. This k value was 93 times
higher than that for the WO3 NPs.

The above results
indicated that the amount of RhB adsorbed on the particle surface
increased as the reduction temperature increased. The adsorption process
reached equilibrium after several minutes, which indicated the formation
of a monolayer of adsorbed molecules on the particle surface.20 The adsorption ability of the WOx NPs can be evaluated using the following equations31 1   2  where γ is the adsorption
percentage relative to the initial concentration, C0 is the initial RhB concentration, C is the final RhB concentration after adsorption, V is the volume of RhB solution (L), m is the mass
of the WOx NPs (g), and Qc is the amount of adsorbed RhB. A summary of the calculation
results is shown in Table 2. All measurements were carried out inside a waste model solution
of RhB,32 with an initial concentration
at 12 mg L–1. The highest Qc among the four samples (WOx NPs
reduced at 500 °C are excluded) was 16.16 mg g–1 for the WOx (425 °C) NPs, whereas
the lowest Qc was 0.75 mg g–1 for the WOx (300 °C) NPs. The amount
of adsorbed RhB on the surface of the WOx (425 °C) NPs was 14 times higher than that on the surface of
the WO3 NPs. A repeatability analysis for a time gap of
12 months and a recyclability analysis for three cycles were carried
out for the WOx (425 °C) NPs, and
the results are summarized in Figure 5c,d. The WOx NPs reduced
at 425 °C were able to maintain their performance for 1 year
and to retain about 90% of their initial performance in the third
cycle, indicating a pretty good particle stability. The different
adsorption profiles of the WOx NPs after
one year (Figure 5c)
might be due to a partially oxidized surface that led to different
stabilities and amount of oxygen vacancies inside the NPs.

Table 2 RhB Adsorption Percentage (γ) and Amounts of Adsorbed RhB (Qc) over the WO3 NPs and WOx NPs Reduced at Different Temperatures
sample	γ (%)	Qc (mg g–1)	
WO3	4.96	1.19	
WOx (300 °C)	3.13	0.75	
WOx (400 °C)	25.34	6.08	
WOx (425 °C)	67.34	16.16	
Figure 2g shows that the SBET values of the WOx NPs were smaller than that of the WO3 NPs. Therefore,
the significant increase in adsorption was not attributable to the SBET. Instead, the higher adsorption showed that
the WOx NPs had a greater number of surface
active sites than the WO3 NPs. The surface charge of WO3 NPs at pH 7 was negative (about −60.1 mV), and they
could retain their negative surface charge after being reduced to
WOx NPs (about −49.7 mV for NPs
reduced at 425 °C). The interaction between the surface of the
WO3 NPs and cationic RhB was driven by electrostatic attraction.
The oxygen vacancies within the crystal structure of the WOx NPs stimulated electron discharge to the NP
surface, which enhanced the RhB–WOx attraction. Therefore, the WOx NPs have
good potential as an adsorbent for cationic dyes. The presence of
free electrons inside the structure of the WOx NPs allows them to begin degrading RhB prior to visible light irradiation.

In photocatalysis, the band gap plays a crucial role in the absorption
of visible light. The WOx NPs had narrower
band gaps than the WO3 NPs, so exhibited better photocatalytic
performance. The presence of oxygen vacancies created a band tail
from the initial conduction band.33 As
a result, the lifetime of electron–hole separation was longer,
which induced more excited electrons (e–) to be
generated according to15 3   4   5   6  After photoexcitation,
the photocatalytic reaction occurred. In general, the formation of
superoxide anions (O2•–) was induced
by the reduction of O2 by electrons, whereas hydroxyl radicals
(OH•) were generated from the reaction between H2O and unstable O2•–.34 In the final step, OH• as
the dominant active species decomposed the RhB (see Figures S7 and S8 in the Supporting Information). A detailed
mechanism of the photocatalytic process was proposed in our previous
research.35 Unfortunately, the edge of
the WOx conduction band was higher than
the energy of the H2/H2O reaction, and the presence
of different oxidation states resulted in rapid electron transport.
This meant that the electron–hole pairs tended to recombine
rapidly.36 This was evident from the results
where the decomposition rates of RhB under visible light irradiation
were lower than those in dark conditions.

Compared with the
adsorption process, the photocatalytic performance of the current
WOx NPs requires improvement. Nevertheless,
the results provide new information and possibilities for creating
adsorbents or catalysts, which can be activated with or without visible
light and without using any expensive cocatalyst material, such as
Ag and Pt.

Conclusions
Tungsten blue oxide (WOx) NPs were prepared
via the reduction method under a hydrogen gas atmosphere. The presence
of oxygen vacancies in the WOx NPs could
be controlled by varying the reduction temperature. XRD indicated
that the crystal structure of the WOx NPs
did not significantly change when they were reduced at temperatures
lower than 400 °C, despite their change in color. XRD peaks corresponding
to the WO2.9, WO2.7, and WO2.0 phases
were observed when the NPs were reduced at 400–500 °C.
The optimum reduction temperature was considered to be 425 °C,
as evidenced by the presence of WO2.0 peaks in the XRD
pattern of the resulting WOx NPs. The
band gap of the WO3 NPs (2.61 eV) decreased to 2.37 eV
for the WOx (425 °C) NPs. Oxygen
vacancies played an important role in surface active sites. This resulted
in the RhB adsorption of the WOx NPs being
higher than that of the WO3 NPs. The WOx (425 °C) NPs decomposed RhB, with up to 32% of RhB
remaining in dark conditions and 12% of RhB remaining under visible
light irradiation. The corresponding reaction rate constant was 7.5
× 10–3 min–1. The ability
to adsorb cationic RhB by the WOx NPs
was 93 times higher than that of the WO3 NPs. Thus, these
findings open new possibilities for fabricating adsorbents and catalysts
for various applications. Further study of the physical and chemical
properties, including the nanostructuration of the WOx NPs, to improve the photocatalytic performance is
ongoing.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of WOx Nanoparticles
WOx NPs were synthesized from plasma-synthesized
WO3 NPs (used as received from Nishin Engineering Inc.,
Japan without any additional treatment) with an average particle size
of 6 nm. Synthesis was carried out via a thermal reduction process
inside a 40 cm long electric vacuum furnace with a diameter of 4 cm.
In a typical process, 0.5 g of plasma-synthesized WO3 NPs
were loaded into ceramic boats, which were placed in the center of
the furnace. Before heating, the furnace chamber was purged several
times with high-purity He gas. The reduction temperature was varied
from 100 to 700 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1, and reduction was carried out for 1 h. Throughout
the entire process, high-purity H2 gas was flown into the
furnace chamber at a rate 1 L min–1.

Characterization of Physicochemical Properties
The phase compositions of the particles were identified by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer, equipped
with Cu Kα radiation and a LinxEye detector. XRD patterns were
collected for 10° < 2θ < 70°. The morphologies
of the particles were investigated using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis (JEM-3000F, JEOL, Japan) at an operating voltage of
297 kV. Specific surface areas were calculated from N2 adsorption
isotherms measured at 77.15 K, using the Brunner–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method (BELSORP 28SA, Bel Japan). Prior to surface area determination,
the powder samples were dried for 2.5 h at 200 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The composition of chemical bonding was investigated
with a Raman spectrophotometer (T64000 coupled with a He–Cd
laser and CCD detector, HORIBA-Jobin Yvon, Japan). XPS measurements
(ESCA-3400 with Mg Kα as an X-ray source, Shimadzu Corp., Japan)
were carried out to observe the binding energies around O 1s orbital.
The XPS results were adjusted to C–C binding energy at 285
eV. To estimate the band gaps of the samples, diffuse reflectance
measurements were recorded using an ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectrophotometer (UV-3150, Shimadzu Corp., Japan).

Adsorption and Photocatalytic Performance Analysis
The adsorption and photocatalytic performance of the WOx NPs were evaluated based on the degradation
of RhB. A photoreactor system equipped with a solar simulator (PEC-L11,
Peccell Technologies Inc., Japan) was used as the visible light source.
In a typical degradation experiment, 100 mg of WOx NPs was dispersed in 200 mL of RhB solution (12 mg L–1; Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan). The
adsorption process was monitored under dark conditions for 3 h before
starting the photocatalytic activity measurements. The photocatalytic
activity was observed for 2 h under visible light irradiation.

During the photocatalytic activity measurements, O2 gas
was fed into the solution at a rate of 0.2 L min–1, to maintain a constant concentration of dissolved oxygen. The reaction
mixture was subjected to continuous stirring (400 rpm) at ambient
temperature (25 °C). Aliquots (2 mL) of solution were removed
at certain times, which were then centrifuged at 15 000 rpm
for 5 min. The supernatant was used to observe the change in RhB concentration
over time. For this analysis, a UV–vis absorption spectrophotometer
(UV-3150, Shimadzu Corp., Japan) was used to obtain the absorption
spectra of samples at given times.

To check the stability of
this material, a recyclability analysis was conducted using WOx NPs reduced at 425 °C. As an initial amount,
100 mg of WOx (425 °C) NPs was dispersed
into 200 mL of RhB solution. The analysis was carried out for three
cycles. For each cycle, the initial concentration of the RhB solution
was maintained at 12 mg L–1, and the remaining RhB
concentration was checked after stirring for 3 h in dark conditions
and 2 h under visible light irradiation. Between cycles, a washing
treatment to remove all RhB molecules from the catalyst surface was
done several times using ultrapure water followed by centrifugation
at 15 000 rpm for 15 min. After the RhB molecules were completely
removed, the NPs were dried inside a vacuum furnace at 130 °C
