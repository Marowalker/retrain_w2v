In
this work, nanoporous carbon (NPC) was synthesized by direct
carbonization of MOF-5 (a famous metal–organic framework).
The structure and morphology of the prepared MOF-derived nanoporous
carbon (MOF-NPC) were investigated by X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and scanning electron microscopy methods. The MOF-NPC was
then used to adsorb copper ions from aqueous solutions. To evaluate
the performance of the prepared MOF-NPC to remove copper ions, both
adsorption kinetics and adsorption equilibrium experiments were carried
out and then the obtained data were modeled with various models. Also,
the efficacy of temperature and the pH of the solution on the removal
efficiency were checked. The results show that the prepared MOF-NPC
is a superadsorbent for the removal of copper ions from aqueous solutions.
Finally, the removal percentage of copper ions by the prepared MOF-NPC
was compared with other activated carbon adsorbents to show its incredible
efficiency.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, the soil and water pollution by different contaminants
is a serious threat to the environment. Among these pollutants, there
are heavy metal ions, such as copper ions, which are released from
various industries including mining, electroplating, extracting, and
pigments.1,2 Heavy-metals ions are not biodegradable.
Copper ions is an indispensable element for the health of the human
body; however, it is toxic at high uptakes and may cause serious problems
to humans, such as memory loss, kidney and liver damage, schizophrenia,
and hypertension.3

Up to now, different
methods have been allocated to remove copper
ions from aqueous solutions, including membrane processes, electrodeposition,
reverse osmosis, ion exchange, nanofiltration, and adsorption.4−6 Among the above-mentioned methods, adsorption is preferred due to
its high efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and convenience.7 So far, a great number of adsorbents have been
reported to adsorb copper ions, such as Ag-doped ZnO,8 microstructured zinc oxides,9 γ-alumina,10 graphene oxide–chitosan
aerogel,11 natural manganese dioxide,12 metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived
nanoporous carbon (NPC),13 and nanoporous
MOF-5.14

New materials, such as nanoporous
carbon, with features like high
pore volume and specific surface area, good mechanical/thermal stability,
and fast kinetics, exhibit a very high potential for use as catalyst
supports, electrode, and gas storage and adsorbent materials.15−19 Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are ordered
crystalline structure, have been used as a precursor to fabrication
of nanoporous carbon.13,20−29 In our recent work,14 we have synthesized
MOF-5, which shows excellent efficiency, and used it as an absorbent
for copper ions.

In this research, we selected MOF-5 as a precursor.
Then, it was
directly carbonized to fabricate a nanoporous carbon (MOF-NPC) and
employed to adsorb the copper ions from aqueous solutions. The adsorption
of Cu ions was investigated by MOF-NPC under different conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization
Morphology of the
obtained MOF-5 and MOF-NPC were illuminated by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images at different magnifications (Figure 1a–d). These images indicate that the
morphology of MOF-NPC with cubic texture is similar to the parent
MOF-5 structure.30 Thus, the carbonization
process does not change the morphology of the precursor at 530 °C.

Figure 1 Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of (a, b) MOF-5 and (c,
d) MOF-NPC with different magnifications.

To determine the structural properties of MOF-NPC, N2 adsorption–desorption experiment was carried out,
and the
results are shown in Figure 2a,b. The MOF-NPC displays a type IV isotherm with a hysteresis
loop, which demonstrates the presence of mesopores. The obtained hysteresis
loop for MOF-NPC is similar to the simulated hysteresis loop (isotherm
7 in ref (31)), which
corresponds to a porous solid with the following structural parameters:
very low ratio of macropore surface area to the total surface area
and also medium ratio of micropore volume to total pore volume. The
structural properties of the MOF-NPC are listed in Table 1.

The X-ray
diffraction (XRD) schema of the MOF-NPC is shown in Figure S1. A board peak centered at 2θ
= 21° approves the formation of graphitic carbon structures.

The structure of nanoporous carbon derived from MOF-5 was investigated
using Raman spectroscopy. In Figure S2,
the spectra shows two main peaks related to carbon; the D band at
1375 cm–1 and G band at 1581 cm–1 correspond to the structural imperfections and tangential vibrations,
respectively. The relative ratio of the “D” to “G”
peak intensity (ID/IG) is commensurate to the number of imperfections in nanoporous
carbon; because this ratio is <1, it is clear that the graphitic
structure is dominant in the prepared adsorbent.

Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) for the investigation of decomposition
behavior of MOF-5 was performed under argon atmosphere with a heating
rate of 10 °C/min from ambient temperature to 600 °C. The
observed TGA curve of MOF-5 (Figure S3)
is similar to the previously reported curves.32 As the figure shows, the main mass loss due to carbonization occurs
between 420 and 510 °C.

2.2 Adsorption Kinetics
Generally, the
kinetics investigations can reveal important information about the
adsorption process. So, the performance of the adsorbent for the elimination
of copper ions was determined by the kinetics studies of adsorption. Figure 3 shows that the adsorption
of copper ions is a function of time. In Figure 3, it is clear that the uptake of copper ions
into the MOF-NPC is sharp in the early moments and reaches an equilibrium
after few minutes. The reason for these observations is that the number
of available sites for absorption in the initial stages is high.

Figure 3 Adsorption
of copper ions (300 ppm) by MOF-NPC as a function of
contact time.

To model the adsorption
kinetics data, different kinetic models
(Table 2) have been
used. Table 3 demonstrates
the results of modeling with various models. According to the values
obtained for r2 (correlation coefficient)
and root-mean-square (RMS) error, it is obvious that the pseudo-n-order (PnO) model represents the best
fitting to the experimental kinetics data. The fitting of this model
to the adsorption kinetic data reveals that the surface of the MOF-NPC
as an adsorbent is heterogeneous for the adsorption of copper ions.

2.3 Adsorption Isotherm
How to interact
adsorbent with adsorbate when the process achieves an equilibrium
condition is indicated by the adsorption isotherm. In Figure 4, the data related to the equilibrium
adsorption of copper ions by the prepared MOF-NPC is shown. By increasing
the initial concentration of copper ions, the qe value increases up to the saturation value.

Figure 4 Adsorption isotherm of
copper ions by MOF-NPC.

To calculate the maximum adsorbent absorption capacity, the
equilibrium
adsorption data were fitted to the modified Langmuir (eq 1) and the modified Langmuir–Freundlich
(eq 2) models, which
have been recently presented for the adsorption from the liquid phase.39 1   2  where qe is the
amount of adsorbate per unit mass of the adsorbent at equilibrium
time and qm is the monolayer adsorption
capacity. KML and KMLF are the equilibrium constants of modified Langmuir and
modified Langmuir–Freundlich, respectively. Ce is the equilibrium concentration and Cs is the saturation concentration of the solute (for the
present system, the Cs value for CuSO4·5H2O is 184 g/L40) and n is the surface heterogeneity constant. The
results of the fitting are listed in Table 4.

Table 4 Obtained Constants
of Various Isotherms
for the Adsorption of Cu Ion onto MOF-NPC
isotherm	qm (mg/g)	KML	KMLF	n	r2	RMS	
modified Langmuir	824.58	17 215	 	 	0.9608	56.42	
modified Langmuir–Freundlich	1071.67	 	7781.83	0.52	0.9915	28.03	
Due to the obtained r2 (correlation
coefficient) and the RMS error values, the modified Langmuir–Freundlich
model demonstrates better the adsorption of copper ions by adsorbent.
The modeling of adsorption equilibrium data with modified Langmuir–Freundlich
model demonstrates that the adsorbent surface is heterogeneous and
provides various adsorption sites for adsorption. This result is consistent
with the conclusion gained from kinetics modeling.

The maximum
adsorption capacity (qm) of the prepared
MOF-NPC for copper ions based on modified Langmuir–Freundlich
model is almost equal to 1071 mg/g. This amount is much higher than
the maximum adsorption capacity of the other activated carbons that
have been used for adsorption of copper ions. Very high adsorption
capacity of the prepared MOF-NPC indicated that this is a superadsorbent
for copper ions.

The percentage removal (Re% = 100 × (C0 – Ce)/C0) of copper ions by the prepared MOF-NPC was
compared
with several commercial activated carbons such as granular activated
carbon, activated carbon cloth, powdered activated carbon, MOF-NC13,
and MOF-514 as adsorbents. Figure 5 shows the results of the removal
percentage after 45 min and also 6 h. As can be seen, the efficiency
of MOF-NPC to remove copper ions is much more than that of other absorbents
used (about 10 times higher than commercial activated carbons). And,
this suggests that the prepared adsorbent (MOF-NPC) is an efficient
superadsorbent.

ppm)
by MOF-NPC and other adsorbents.

2.4 Effect of Temperature
Because temperature
is the main factor in the adsorption process, the effect of temperature
(25, 35, 45, and 55 °C) on the removal percentage of Cu ion by
MOF-NPC was investigated. Figure S4 represents
the percentage removal of copper ions by the prepared adsorbent at
several temperatures. It is obvious that as the temperature rises,
the elimination efficiency also increases. This result indicates that
the adsorption of copper ions from the aqueous solution by MOF-NPC
is endothermic (ΔHad > 0).

2.5 Effect of Solution pH
To evaluate
the effect of solution pH onto the performance of adsorption, first,
the point of zero charge pH (pHpzc) of adsorbent was specified.
As shown in Figure S5, the pHpzc of MOF-NPC is about 7.8; this means that, at pH < 7.8, the surface
charge is positive, whereas at pH > 7.8, the surface charge is
negative.

Due to the precipitation of copper ions at pH >
6, the removal
efficiency of the MOF-NPC for copper ions was evaluated within the
range of 3.0 < pH < 5.2. These results are shown in Figure 6. It is obvious that
with increasing pH, the removal efficiency increases. In this pH range,
the absorbent surface charge is positive. So, a decrease in hydrogen
ion concentration (increasing of pH) leads to a reduction in the positive
charge of surface, and thereby, the repulsion between the surface
and Cu2+ reduces. Also, in solutions with low pH, the competition
between hydrogen and copper ions leads to a decrease in the efficiency
of MOF-NPC to adsorb Cu ions from the aqueous solution.

Figure 6 Effect of initial
pH of the solution on the percentage removal
of copper ions by MOF-NPC.

2.6 Recycling Capability
The recycling
capability of the used adsorbent was investigated by utilization of
deionized water, H2SO4 (0.1 M), and HNO3 (0.1 M). Figure S6 illustrates
the results of this study. As this result shows, about 40% of copper
ions adsorption capacity of MOF-NPC can be recovered after exposure
to sulfuric acid.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, heterogenic nanoporous carbons were prepared by carbonization
of MOF-5, and the morphology of the prepared adsorbent did not change
during carbonization. The obtained nanoporous carbon (MOF-NPC) indicated
great adsorption efficiency for the removal of copper ions compared
with commercial activated carbons. Both kinetic and equilibrium experimental
data indicated that MOF-NPC provides heterogenic surface for the adsorption
of copper ions with different adsorption active sites.

The adsorption
investigation at different temperatures shows that
with increasing temperature, the removal efficiency of MOF-NPC for
copper ions increases. The maximum percentage of copper ions removed
by MOF-NPC was obtained at pH 5.2.

4 Experimental
Methods
4.1 Preparation of MOF-5 and Nanoporous Carbon
MOF-5 was prepared according to our previous report.14 Briefly, 0.82 g of terephthalic acid (BDC) and
3.86 g of zinc nitrate tetrahydrate were added to 112.8 mL of dimethylformamide
and then the resultant mixture was mildly stirred until whole of solids
were dissolved at ambient conditions. The reaction mixture was heated
under a reflux for 4 h at 130 °C. After about an hour, a white
powder (MOF-5) appeared. The resultant sample was cooled to ambient
temperature. The precipitate was detached and carefully washed. The
obtained white powders were dried for 3 h at 60 °C in a vacuum
oven.

For the fabrication of porous carbon, about 500 mg of
MOF-5 was loaded in a ceramic crucible and then, to remove the solvent
molecules, the sample was placed into the vacuum oven and degassed
at 200 °C for 3 h. Afterward, the sample was heated at a constant
heating rate of 5 °C min–1 in a tube furnace
to 530 °C for 8 h under the protection of nitrogen flow. Finally,
the sample was cooled to ambient temperature.

4.2 Adsorption
Experiments
For the determination
of the residual concentration of copper ions, the complexometric method
was applied. In this method, Zincon41 (in
a buffer solution, at pH = 7) and UV/visible spectrophotometer (at
600 nm) have been used. The performances of the MOF-NPC as an adsorbent
to eliminate copper ions were evaluated from both equilibrium and
kinetics viewpoint.

The kinetics experiments were performed
using various samples of 2 mg of adsorbent and 10 mL of copper ions
solution with a constant initial concentration (300 ppm). The samples
were stirred in water bath shaker with 150 rpm at room temperature
(25 °C). After centrifugation, they were sampled to measure the
residual concentration of copper ions at different time intervals.

The equilibrium experiments were accomplished by adding 4 mg of
MOF-NPC into 10 mL of several solutions with different concentrations
of copper ions (10–1000 ppm). The samples were placed in a
shaker at 150 rpm and 25 °C. After 24 h, the adsorbent was separated
by centrifugation and the equilibrium concentration of copper ions
measured.

The adsorption capacity (amount of copper ions adsorbed
per unit
mass of adsorbent) was obtained by using eq 3 3  where qt and qe are the amount of adsorbate
per unit mass of the adsorbent at time t and equilibrium,
respectively. C0, Ct, and Ce are
the concentrations of copper ions in the solution at initial, any
time, and equilibrium, respectively. V is the volume
of the solution and M is the mass of the adsorbent.

Using a method conducted by Faria et al.,42 pHpzc (pH of point of zero charge) of MOF-NPC has been
obtained.
