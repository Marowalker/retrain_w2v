The
With-No-Lysine (WNK) kinase is considered to be a master regulator
for various cation-chloride cotransporters involved in maintaining
cell-volume and ion homeostasis. Here, we have investigated the phosphorylation-induced
structural dynamics of the WNK1 kinase bound to an inhibitor via atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations. Results from our simulations show
that the phosphorylation at Ser382 could stabilize the
otherwise flexible activation loop (A-loop). The intrahelix salt-bridge
formed between Arg264 and Glu268 in the unphosphorylated
system is disengaged after the phosphorylation, and Glu268 reorients itself and forms a stable salt-bridge with Arg348. The dynamic cross-correlation analysis shows that phosphorylation
diminishes anticorrelated motions and increases correlated motions
between different domains. Structural network analysis reveals that
the phosphorylation causes structural rearrangements and shortens
the communication path between the αC-helix and catalytic loop,
making the binding pocket more suitable for accommodating the ligand.
Overall, we have characterized the structural changes in the WNK kinase
because of phosphorylation in the A-loop, which might help in designing
rational drugs.

Introduction
Hypertension or high
blood pressure is a common disorder affecting
billion people worldwide.1 It leads to
various other disease conditions, such as myocardial infarction, renal
failure, and congestive heart failure. Although available antihypertensive
drugs help to control blood pressure, the emergence of the drug-resistant
variant has created a global challenge in treating hypertension. Further,
the molecular pathogenesis mechanism of hypertension is poorly understood.
Gene mutations involved in the pathway of renal salt reabsorption
could affect the blood pressure. The first link between the With-No-Lysine
(WNK) signaling pathway and hypertension came into the picture with
the discovery of an inherited form of hypertension, known as Pseudohypoaldosteronism
type II (PHA II), or Gordon’s syndrome, caused by the WNK mutation.2 Intron deletion in the WNK1 gene as well as the
missense mutation in the WNK4 gene cause PHAII.3 The WNK signaling pathway that is involved in regulating
blood pressure participates in the activation of its downstream kinases,
such as oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related
proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) being phosphorylated by WNK1 and
WNK4, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the Na+/Cl– cotransporter (NCC).4,5 The inhibiting
function of WNK is considered as an effective approach for controlling
blood pressure.

One of the largest groups of a gene family in
eukaryotes involving
cell growth and differentiation is the protein kinases (PKs), which
carried out phosphorylation reaction by transferring γ-phosphate
of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a peptide substrate.6 The catalytic domain of these PKs is highly conserved7,8 and forms a gene superfamily except few including WNK, sterile serine/threonine
kinases (STE), and tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) family.9 The name of WNK comes from the characteristic feature of
the unique placement of catalytic lysine present in the β2 strand,
instead of β3 strand as found in other kinases. The WNK kinase
domain (KD) comprises an N-terminus (residue 218–483) and two
coiled-coil domains in the C-terminus (residue 563–597 and
1814–1841).9 Along with the KD,
it has an autoinhibitory domain between residues 490 and 550 that
suppresses kinase activity as well as other different protein-motif
interactions. WNK undergoes autophosphorylation at Ser382 and becomes active. It is known as a major autophosphorylation site
as the mutant (S382A) yields ∼1–3% of wild-type activity.
Further, the residue Ser378 located in the activation-loop
is also found to be autophosphorylated to enhance the kinase activity.10 It is a minor phosphorylation site. The mutant
S378A showed ∼50% of the activity of wild-type WNK1. Overall,
the major phosphorylation site is Ser382, which is essential
for the activity of WNK1.11

The overall
architecture of WNK resembles other kinases consisting
of dual domains: the small N-lobe comprises β strands and an
α-helix (αC-helix), whereas the C-lobe comprises an α-helix
and a hinge region that acts as a bridge between N- and C-lobes by
accommodating ATP and ATP-competitive inhibitors12 (see Figure 1). There is a unique N-terminal domain consisting of six β-sheets
forming a full β-barrel. On the contrary, five β-strands
are seen in other kinases. This additional β0 forms a hydrogen
bond with β1. The N-lobe comprises a glycine-rich loop (GXGXXKXV)
from the first two β strands that place the unique catalytic
lysine of WNK (Lys233). Various conserved sites near phosphate
transfer including a glycine-rich loop (G-loop) and an αC-helix
in N-lobe, and the activation loop (A-loop) and catalytic loop (C-loop)
in the C-lobe perform the crucial catalytic function. A critical catalytic
triad Asp-Leu-Gly (DLG) (residues 368–370) motif is present
in the activation segment (residues 360–390) in the C-lobe.13 The usual salt-bridge between Lys72 and Glu91 (residue numbers corresponding to protein kinase
A, PKA) has been observed in many kinases, and this Lys72 interacts with α and β phosphates of ATP and involves
in protonating ADP or related acid–base reactions.14−16 However, in WNK1, Cys250 occupies this position in subdomain
II (β3 strand) although its side chain is positioned away from
the active site. Instead, Lys233 in β2 strand of
subdomain I reaches the active site and plays the role of catalytic
lysine (see Figure 1). Previously, mutagenesis study has demonstrated that the mutation
at Lys233 abolishes the catalytic activity of WNK1.9 For most of the kinases, primary regions involved
in controlling the activation process are the Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif,
A-loop, and the αC-helix.17,18 For many kinases, such
as IGF-1RK, it has been observed that the autophosphorylation of A-loop
leads to an extended conformation for accommodating ATP and substrate
and thus forms the catalytically active kinase.19,20 It implies that the kinases interconvert between an active and an
inactive conformation because of phosphorylation at the A-loop site.21−23

Recently, Yamada and co-workers have resolved the crystal structure
of unphosphorylated WNK1 complexed with an inhibitor, WNK463 (PDB
code: 5DRB).24 The 3-D structure of the inhibitor is shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
They have found that the A-loop and αC-helix lie away from the
hinge region compared to apo-WNK1 to accommodate
the inhibitor and adopts a DLG-in and an αC-helix-out (i.e.,
inactive) conformation. Previously, many experimental and theoretical
studies have been conducted elucidating the effects of ligand binding
and mutation on kinase activities, dynamics, and conformational changes.25−28 However, the molecular mechanism and impact of autophosphorylation,
that is, A-loop phosphorylation on its structure and dynamics, is
not known from the crystal structure alone. Therefore, we conducted
microsecond long unbiased MD simulations to elucidate the effect of
phosphorylation on structural dynamics of WNK kinase and investigated
the biophysical basis of binding of WNK463 to the unphosphorylated
and phosphorylated WNK.

Results and Discussion
Structural Stability and
Flexibility Analysis
First,
root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) of Cα atoms from
the initial structure were computed to find the overall stability
and convergence of simulations. From Figure 2A, it is observed that rmsds of uWNK and
pWNK fluctuate initially, and then become stable from 400 ns onward,
indicating the trajectory convergence. It is evident from the figure
that in the case of uWNK, the system drifts from its initial structure
till 100 ns and again there is a sudden jump in rmsd at 360 ns, and
then slowly it reaches a plateau after 480 ns. On the contrary, the
pWNK system reaches equilibrium soon after 200 ns and remains stable
after that. The average rmsd values of uWNK and pWNK are found to
be 2.5 and 1.7 Å, respectively. An intermediate rmsd of 2.1 Å
is obtained for 2pWNK (see Table 1). However, a similar trend in Cα rmsd
is observed in cases of u-Apo and p-Apo systems (see Figure S2).

The structural compactness
can be analyzed by calculating the radius
of gyration (Rg) of the WNK complexes.
The average Rg calculated for pWNK and
2pWNK were found to be the same (∼18.7 Å), whereas in
the case of uWNK, a slightly higher value of 18.9 Å was obtained
(see Table 1). The
frequency distribution of Rg for the complexes
are shown in Figure S3. Further, we superimposed
the final structural coordinates from the simulations of uWNK and
pWNK using Superpose server29 to observe
the structural changes as shown in Figure 2b and found that major changes have occurred
in the A-loop only. The atomic positional fluctuations or root-mean-square-fluctuations
(RMSFs) describe the flexibility of an individual residue. RMSFs of
protein Cα atoms of uWNK and pWNK during the simulations
are shown in Figure 2c. It is evident from Figure 2c that the activation segment in uWNK is more flexible than
in pWNK. Furthermore, loop regions between β4−β5
and β7−β8 show higher flexibility in uWNK compared
to pWNK. A higher degree fluctuation regions in the complexes indicate
that it may be involved in the inactivation mechanism and substrate
binding.30

Structural Changes in the
Activation Segment
The time
evolution of the Cα rmsds of A-loop from the initial
structure is shown in Figure 3A. From Figure 3A, uWNK shows drifting in the initial period of simulation with a
sudden jump at 380 ns, which then converges to an equilibrium state
and reaches a plateau after 400 ns. In contrast, for pWNK, the rmsd
reaches an equilibrium immediately after 150 ns and then stays stable
thereafter. The average Cα rmsd of the A-loop for
uWNK and pWNK are determined as 4.7 and 2.3 Å, respectively,
that is, the average rmsd of uWNK is twice that of pWNK. rmsd values
show a massive configurational change in the A-loop after phosphorylation.
Similarly, in the 2pWNK system, the average Cα rmsd
of A-loop is found to be 3.2 Å, which falls between that of uWNK
and pWNK systems.

systems. (D) Position of conserved Thr386 in uWNK (green
cartoon) and pWNK (pink cartoon) and the average distance between
Thr386-Ser382 in both complexes.

Furthermore, to extract the predicted structures from the
simulated
trajectories and to see structural variations in the A-loop, we have
performed clustering analysis using k-means clustering
algorithm.31,32 Clustering was done based on
the Cα rmsd distance metric. A representative frame
in a cluster is defined as the smallest average distance from other
frames that also belongs to that cluster. As the number of clusters
in k-mean clustering is defined arbitrarily, and Figure 3A suggests three
possible distinct states in uWNK, we have chosen three clusters for
the k-means clustering analysis for both uWNK and
pWNK. The size of the cluster with respect to the total trajectory
represents the percentage of the dominant conformations of the A-loop
out of three clusters for both the systems and is shown in Figure 3B,C for uWNK and
pWNK, respectively. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 in uWNK correspond to 58.6,
27.8, and 13.6%, respectively. Similarly, for pWNK, clusters 1, 2,
and 3 correspond to 82.4, 10, and 7.6%, respectively. It suggests
that the unphosphorylated A-loop undergoes dynamic fluctuations, resulting
in more distinct conformations; on the other hand, phosphorylation
has stabilized the A-loop into a single distinct conformation. The
dominant conformation of uWNK is outwardly displaced compared to the
activation segment of pWNK. Overall, the phosphorylation at Ser382 stabilizes the A-loop significantly compared to uWNK and
2pWNK. However, a similar trend in Cα rmsd of the
A-loop for u-Apo and p-Apo was observed as seen in Figure S4. A similar observation was made in other kinases,
such as IRAK30 and IGF-1RK,33 suggesting that upon phosphorylation in A-loop,
it may allow substrate access and activate the kinase.34 Furthermore, the conformational changes in the
A-loop are described by the free energy landscape (FEL) of rmsd versus Rg of the A-loop region and is shown in Figure S5. The FEL described the conformational
space covered by the A-loop. It shows that in uWNK there are two major
conformational states characterized by rmsd ∼4.5 Å/Rg ∼9.5 Å and rmsd ∼2.1 Å/Rg ∼10 Å, whereas for pWNK there
is a single broad conformational space explored with rmsd ≈
2.2 Å/Rg ≈ 9.7 Å, indicating
that more deviation is observed in the A-loop of uWNK compared to
pWNK. Also, another FEL as a function of rmsd of A-loop versus rmsd
of αC-helix is drawn and shown in Figure S6. This again supports the above observation.

To further
characterize the induced structural variation because
of phosphorylation, the Cα–Cα distance between Ser378 and Ser382 is calculated
for all systems and found to vary between 6.2 and 12.5 Å (see Table 1). For u-Apo, an average
distance of 6.2 Å is obtained, whereas 10.4 Å is obtained
for the p-Apo system. Similarly, a relatively higher distance is obtained
for pWNK (12.5 Å) compared to uWNK (9.6 Å). A similar trend
is observed for the Cα–Cα distance between Ser382 and Thr386 (see Table 1). Overall, this suggests
that the A-loop adopts an extended conformation upon phosphorylation
at Ser382. Furthermore, we have estimated the solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA) of Ser378, Ser382, and Thr386 for all systems, and the corresponding average value is
reported in Table S1 (Supporting Information). It is evident from Table S1 that the
average SASA of Ser382 and Thr386 increases
significantly because of phosphorylation at Ser382. This
may explain the extended conformation of the A-loop because of phosphorylation.

Dynamics of Regulatory and Catalytic Spines
The regulatory
spine or R-spine, also known as the hydrophobic spine, consists of
hydrophobic residues between N- and C-lobes and forms a conserved
motif including Leu299, Leu272, His347, and Leu369 from the β5 strand, αC-Helix
of N-lobe, HRD, and DLG motifs from the C-lobe. This spine is least
exposed to the solvent and arranged contiguously in the case of an
active kinase, whereas in an inactive kinase, the structure disintegration
occurs in part formed by the αC-Helix and A-loop.35 In Figure S7, the
probability distribution of Cα rmsd from the initial
structure is shown. The average Cα rmsd for uWNK
and pWNK over the simulations were estimated as ∼1.0 and ∼0.6
Å, respectively. An intermediate Cα rmsd of
0.8 Å was obtained for the 2pWNK system (see Table 1). Again, a slightly lower rmsd
was obtained for pWNK compared to uWNK and 2pWNK, suggesting that
the unphosphorylation causes slight destabilization to the R-spine.

There is another stretch of hydrophobic residues between N and
C-lobes (such as Val235, Ala248, Leu313, Ile355, Ile357, Leu413, and Ala416), known as catalytic spine or C-spine, which forms an interaction
with ATP. The distribution of Cα rmsd of the C-spine
(see Figure S8) is quite stable in both
the uWNK and pWNK complexes with an average rmsd of ∼0.5 Å.
A similar average rmsd of 0.5 Å was obtained for 2pWNK (see Table 1), which suggests
that in contrast to the R-spine, the C-spine remains unaffected because
of phosphorylation.

Salt-Bridge between the αC-Helix and
Catalytic Loop
The WNK kinase does not have a usual Lys–Glu
ion pair between
the αC-helix and β3 strand, which is evident from Figure
S9 (Supporting Information). The average
distance between NZ atom of Lys233 and CD atom of Glu268 was found to be 17.2 and 15.7 Å for uWNK and pWNK,
respectively. It is in agreement with a previous observation24 where this distance was found to be ∼13
Å for uWNK. However, a different ion pair between Glu268 of the αC-helix and Arg348 of the catalytic loop
was observed, and it was formed transiently in uWNK as shown in Figure 4a, which was also
seen in other kinases, such as IGF-1RK33. On the contrary,
this salt-bridge was quite stable throughout the simulations in case
of pWNK. Average distances of 7.8 and 3.5 Å were found for uWNK
and pWNK, respectively (see Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows the probability of occurrence of the salt-bridge throughout
the simulations, and it was observed that pWNK has a higher probability
of maintaining the salt-bridge compared to uWNK and 2pWNK. Hence,
our simulation results suggest that phosphorylation at Ser382 only forms the stable salt-bridge and helps to activate the kinase.
Also, the interactions between Glu268 and Arg348 for various atoms are shown in Figure S10, suggesting a close hydrogen bond interaction in case of the pWNK
compared to the uWNK system.

Figure 4 (A) Salt-bridge distance calculated between
CD of Glu-268 and CZ
of Arg-348 from the simulations of the complexes uWNK (red), pWNK
(blue), and 2pWNK (gold). (B) Probability distribution of the salt-bridge
distances of the complexes.

Further, we have calculated the native contacts between the αC-helix
and catalytic loop. Residues 265–271 from the αC-helix
and residues 345–352 from the catalytic loop are considered
for the calculation of native contacts and the results are shown in Figure S11. It is evident from Figure S11 that the number of native contacts obtained in
the case of pWNK is relatively higher than in uWNK. Further, it is
evident from Figure S11 that the fraction
of native contacts between Glu268-Arg348 is
also higher in pWNK (∼71%) than in uWNK (∼21%).

To complement the above results, we studied the effect of phosphorylation
on the size and shape of the ATP binding pocket using CASTp,36 and Chimera tool,37 and the last configurations were used for this purpose. The calculated
volumes for uWNK and pWNK were found to be 640.9 and 586.9 Å3, respectively. Overall, it signifies that the A-loop phosphorylation
alters the ATP binding pocket (see Figure S12) by contracting the pocket volume, thus signifying that salt-bridge
formation decreases the pocket size and alters the structure and function
of the kinase.

Interactions Affecting the Dynamics of the
A-Loop and αC-Helix
We have identified several interactions
(see Table 2) affecting
the dynamic behavior of the A-loop
and αC-helix. Critical electrostatic interactions between the
phosphoserine residue of the A-loop with the adjacent charged residues
affect the folding of A-loop and help in positioning substrate binding.
Besides the Arg348-Glu268 salt-bridge interaction
discussed above, other interactions that were affected after phosphorylation
at Ser382 in the A-loop were studied. From the interaction
index graph (see Figure S13), it can be
suggested that in the case of pWNK, the interaction between pSer382 and charged residues of the HRD motif (Arg348 and Asp349) decreases significantly after phosphorylation.
However, the interaction of pSer382 with the Arg255 and Lys256 increases after phosphorylation near the αC-helix
(see Figure 5a,b).
Also, different atoms involved in the interaction between pSer382 and Arg255 as well as other interactions from
A-loop regions were calculated and are shown in Figure S14, correlating well with the observation that phosphorylation
imparts electrostatic effects on nearby residues, resulting in a conformational
change. Overall, it suggests that in the WNK kinase, the interaction
between the A-loop and αC-helix contributes more toward the
stability of its active conformation and influences the orientation
and dynamics of the αC-helix. In addition to interactions with
pSer382, other interactions such as the interaction between
Glu268 and Arg264 also influence the orientation
of the αC-helix. They form an intra-helix salt-bridge in uWNK
(see Figure 5c). After
phosphorylation, Arg264 disengaged from the Glu268, and Glu268 then reoriented toward the active site (see Figure 5d), and formed a
salt-bridge with Arg348, leading to the proper location
of catalytic residues and substrate for the phosphoryl transfer reaction.
Further, it explained the association of the αC-helix with the
A-loop in pWNK. Similar conserved interactions were observed in other
kinases,33,38,39 supporting
the role of interactions of the αC-helix with the A-loop for
the catalytic activity of the kinase.

Structural
Network Analysis
Protein stability or protein
function relies on interactions between residues. In protein contact
network (PCN), amino acids are considered as nodes and edges between
these nodes can be drawn in terms of distance or interaction energy
that depicts the interactions between the residues. Previously, various
structural network approaches have been reported that provide the
structure–function relationship of proteins.40−42 These topological
studies revealed the important residues involved in protein stability,43 protein dynamics,44 allosteric regulations,45 and signal
transduction.45 Different parameters such
as shortest path distance in the network analysis of different proteins
could depict the influence of binding of the inhibitor in the binding
pocket of different systems and deduce the structural significance
of the induced-fit mechanism in protein-inhibitors.46 Similarly, in the WNK kinase, to study how the αC-helix
and catalytic loop communicate in uWNK and pWNK and how the communication
affects the different interactions were studied via network analysis
of protein structures (NAPS).47 The shortest
distance path on the protein network structures was analyzed by considering
the salt-bridge interaction between Glu268 (αC-helix)
and Arg348 (at catalytic loop) and used as a terminal residue
for calculation of the shortest path in NAPS and shown in Figure 6. The shortest path
distance between Glu268 and Arg348 in uWNK spanned
three residues (Pro343, Ile345, Ile346) (Figure 6a); however,
in pWNK it spanned two residues (Gly370 and Ala372) (Figure 6b). This
result suggests that the phosphorylation modifies the shortest communication
path between the αC-helix and catalytic loop, making a region
suitable for accommodating the ligand. Furthermore, the betweenness
parameter was used to study the correlation between residues in the
protein network, and the betweenness values of uWNK and pWNK are shown
in Figure S15A. Residues showing higher
betweenness centrality (BC) values in both systems are reported in Table 3. It is evident from Figure S15A that the betweenness of residues
in pWNK show higher values compared to uWNK, especially in the N-terminal,
αC-helix, and catalytic and A-loop, indicating that upon phosphorylation
the binding pocket regions rearranged and made more related residues
more connected. A similar observation was found in u-Apo and p-Apo
(see Figure S15B) with higher residue–residue
relevance in the case of p-Apo compared to u-Apo. Wilson et al.48 suggested that drug binding leads to conformational
changes via an induced-fit process. On the basis of the betweenness
value, it reflects that the ligand interacts with the residues of
the pre-organized pocket, and phosphorylation causes the stabilization
of the binding pocket through the induced-fit mechanism.

Cooperative
and Anti-Cooperative Motions
To investigate
how phosphorylation affects the domain motions, we generated cross-correlation
maps using Cpptraj module(49) of AMBER tools from the conformations obtained by the molecular
dynamics simulations. In the apo systems, Figure 7A,B), more correlated motions were observed
in u-Apo compared to p-Apo and interestingly when the inhibitor binds
the anti-correlated motions increase, whereas upon phosphorylation
again it diminishes the anti-correlated motion and increases the correlated
motions. In case of uWNK and pWNK (Figure 7C,D), the regions (i) β1−β3,
(ii) hinge, (iii) αEF, (iv) αG-helix, and (v) C-terminal
tail (Ala448-Gln480) are highly correlated.
In uWNK, the interdomain correlated motions were observed in different
regions, such as the R1 region in Figure 7C showed correlated residue interaction between
the catalytic loop with the A-loop and near catalytic residue (HRD
motif, residues 348–350) with a hinge region (residues 303–307).
The anti-cooperative interactions were observed with the catalytic
loop region (residues 348–350) with the A-loop (residues 376–384
in R2 region) as well as with the αC-helix region (R3 region)
as supported above with the higher fluctuation and more considerable
distance among these residues. When WNK KD was phosphorylated at Ser382 (Figure 7D), the observed highly anti-correlated motions seen in R2 and R3
regions of uWNK was diminished and transformed toward correlated motion.
Overall, correlated as well as anti-correlated domain motions were
modified after the phosphorylation at Ser382 of A-loop
and affect the functional dynamics of WNK. In particular, all the
interactions explained in the previous section were justified by the
cross-correlation map such as the salt-bridge between the catalytic
loop (Arg348) and αC-helix (Glu268), as
well as the distance between different residues that control the stability
within the αC-helix (Glu268-Arg264), and
Ser382 with Arg255 and Lys256.

Figure 7 Cross-correlation
matrices of the fluctuations of the coordinates
for Cα atoms around their mean positions for Apo
and complexes are shown in (A) u-Apo, (B) p-Apo, (C) uWNK, and (D)
pWNK, respectively, from simulations. The extent of correlated and
anticorrelated motions are color-coded (1 = highly correlated; 0 =
no correlated; −1 = anticorrelated).

Principal Component Analysis
The principal component
analysis (PCA) results in terms of eigenvalues (3N, 3 × 273 = 819) versus eigenvectors obtained after the diagonalization
of the atomic fluctuations covariance matrix for uWNK and pWNK are
shown in Figure S16. The corresponding
eigenvalues of each eigenvector were plotted in decreasing order.
The first few eigenvalues depict the collective motions of the localized
fluctuations. Comparing the two systems, it indicates that the first
few principal components that described the properties of motions
were not the same, and in uWNK, the magnitudes of the eigenvalues
were higher compared to pWNK. The first few 20 eigenvectors describe
the collective motions approximately, and, the first 10 eigenvectors
account for ∼85, and ∼79% overall motions in uWNK and
pWNK, respectively. Similarly, the first two eigenvectors capture
∼47 and ∼32% of the total motions in uWNK and pWNK,
respectively. Our result suggested the correlated motions were higher
for uWNK in agreement with the cross-correlation results. FEL of the
complexes for the first two principal components is represented in Figure 8. The pattern of
a basin on the FEL is different in both the complexes, as is evident
from Figure 8. In the
case of uWNK, the conformational space showed a multiple dispersed
basin, whereas in the case of pWNK, it showed a single broad and stable
global minimum confined within a particular basin on the free energy
surface. It suggests that for the structural disparity in both complexes,
uWNK attains more conformations compared to pWNK.

Figure 8 FELs generated by projecting
the principal components, PC1, and
PC2 of uWNK (A) and pWNK (B) complexes in MD simulations at 300 K.
The free energies are represented by −KBT ln PPC1,PC2 with PPC1,PC2 being the probability
distribution.

Furthermore, the direction of
motions and magnitude of selected
eigenvectors can be visualized by using “porcupine plots”50 to illustrate the effect of phosphorylation
at the A-loop on the WNK kinase conformation. Porcupine plots, as
shown in Figure 9,
were generated using VMD,51 corresponding
to the first mode that shows the largest concerted motions of Cα
atoms which had been mapped onto the average structure. For easy visualization,
the cutoff was set to 4 Å. Figure 9 shows that the overall direction of motions of uWNK
changes after phosphorylation of the A-loop in pWNK, which agrees
with the PCA plot (Figure 8) and RMSF plot (Figure 2C). Overall, it is observed that the mobility is higher
for uWNK compared to pWNK as can be ascertained from the length of
the eigenvectors (see Figure 9).

the direction of prominent motions for uWNK and pWNK, respectively.
Length of the eigenvectors represents the magnitude of the motions.

Dihedral Principal Component Analysis
As compared to
cartesian coordinates based PCA, which may not provide fully the correct
internal and overall motions, hence to get more detail picture about
the internal motions and dynamic conformations of the A-loop region
after phosphorylation, we performed the dihedral principal component
analysis (dPCA) (see Figure 10). Figure 10 depicts
that in both complexes, dPCA exhibits a large number of minima showing
the different specific conformations. In agreement with PCA results,
a large number of local conformations separated by minima was observed
for uWNK, whereas two major populated conformations were found in
pWNK.

dPCA. Representative structures are also shown.

Energetics of Ligand Binding
To understand the biophysical
basis of molecular recognition of WNK463 by the WNK kinase, all individual
contributions to the total binding free energy were calculated for
both uWNK and pWNK complexes using the molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area (MM-PBSA) scheme. A summary of the contributions of the
binding interactions of the inhibitor (WNK463) with the kinase is
shown graphically in Figure S17, and data
are provided in Table 4. It is evident that the binding is favored by the van der Waals
and intermolecular electrostatic interactions. This was already shown
in our previous study.52 Polar solvation
energy and the configurational entropy mainly disfavor the complex
formation. Results showed that the slightly higher binding affinity
for pWNK compared to uWNK is due to lesser contributions from the
disfavorable components of the binding free energy, such as polar
solvation energy and entropy. Moreover, the overall polar contributions
from the sum of electrostatic and polar solvation energy show positive
results depicting that the van der Waals interaction is highly dominant
for the complex formation. To ensure the above results, we have also
calculated the H-bond occupancy of both the systems throughout the
simulations, shown in Figure S18. It was
in agreement that higher electrostatic interactions in uWNK compared
with pWNK were supported by the higher percentage of H-bond occupancy
between kinase inhibitor (KI) and particular residues of protein such
as Met304@N-KI@N37, Lys233@N-KI@O42, and Asp368@N-KI@H312, respectively. Subsequently, we have also performed
the decomposition of the free energy of individual residues for both
the systems, shown in Figure S19. In uWNK,
the remarkable residues contributing to the binding free energy comes
from Lys233 (−3.0 kcal/mol), Phe283 (−2.4
kcal/mol), Met304 (−2.3 kcal/mol), Phe356 (−2.3 kcal/mol), Val235 (−2.2 kcal/mol),
and Leu369 (−1.0 kcal/mol), and in pWNK major contributions
come from the residues Phe283 (−2.3 kcal/mol), Met304 (−2.3 kcal/mol), Val235 (−2.2
kcal/mol), Phe356 (−2.1 kcal/mol), Lys233 (−1.6 kcal/mol), and Leu369 (−1.3 kcal/mol),
respectively.

WNK–Ligand Interactions
One
of the important
interactions between a ligand and protein is the hydrogen bond that
gives specificity for ligand recognition by proteins. For hydrogen-bond
analysis, the acceptor to donor distance cutoff was taken as 3 Å,
and angle cutoff was set to 135°. To understand these interactions
between kinase and the ligand (WNK463), the lowest energy structures
obtained from the MD simulations were considered. Kuenemann and Fourches53 had observed various hydrogen bond and hydrophobic
interactions such as between imidazole nitrogen of ligand and backbone
Met304 and with Asp368 and Leu369, as well as multiple hydrophobic interactions such as Val235, Ala248, Phe256, Leu272, Leu299, Leu371, and Phe356. We also have
observed the similar interactions between imidazole nitrogen and the
backbone Met304. Interestingly, we also found the hydrogen
bond between amide nitrogen of Lys233 with the oxygen of
WNK463 from our MD simulations, suggesting that conservation of these
hydrogen bonds is crucial for the binding of ligand and designing
of WNK463 analogs against WNK could be reinforced by increasing the
conservation of the interactions with the catalytic residue Lys233 and gatekeeper residue Met304. Common hydrophobic
interactions observed in complexes as shown in Figure S20 were calculated from the LigPlot,54 which include Phe283, Leu369, Gly367, Val281, Asp368, Glu302, Val235, Ala248, Gly228, Thr301, and Phe356. Also, we have found the conserved
π–π stacking interaction (see Figure S21) between Phe283 and oxadiazole group
of WNK463 throughout our simulations as shown in Figure S22 and were seen as constant in both systems with
an average distance of ∼4.3 Å in accordance with the experimental
structure.24

Conclusions
In
this work, 1 μs long MD simulations were performed to
investigate the effect of phosphorylation on the structural dynamics
of the KD by phosphorylating Ser382 of the A-loop. Simulation
results suggest that the phosphorylation leads to the stabilization
of the flexible A-loop by the formation of multiple side-chain interactions
and affects the protein motions in different segments of the KD, such
as the αC-helix, catalytic loop, and A-loop. Stable salt-bridge
interaction between Glu268 and Arg348 was observed
in pWNK. Other interactions such as between Glu268 and
Arg264 was formed only in the case of uWNK, which after
phosphorylation, Arg264 disengaged from Glu268, and the side chain of Glu268 reoriented toward the active
site, and formed a salt-bridge with Arg348, for the appropriate
phosphoryl transfer reaction. Structural network analysis reveals
that the phosphorylation causes structural rearrangements and shortens
the communication path between the αC-helix and catalytic loop,
making binding pocket more suitable to accommodate ligand. Free energy
basin clearly showed there was no conformation selection for uWNK
compared to pWNK. Our simulations’ study also predicts that
the monophosphorylation at Ser382 significantly stabilizes
the structure compare with the other systems and makes the WNK kinase
active in agreement with the experimental findings.10,55

We have also computed and compared the binding affinity for
the
pWNK and uWNK systems. Electrostatic energy and van der Waals interactions,
as well as nonpolar components, always favor the binding, on the other
hand, polar solvation energy and entropy component always disfavor
the binding. Here, the higher binding affinity of pWNK than uWNK is
due to the fewer contributions from the disfavor components of binding
free energy such as polar solvation energy and entropy energy. Moreover,
the overall polar contributions from the sum of electrostatic and
polar solvation energy show positive results, depicting that the main
driving force for the complex formation is provided by the van der
Waals interaction. Overall, this kind of computational study helps
us to understand the structure to function relationship of proteins
to know more about the mechanisms that aid in drug development.

Materials
and Methods
Summary of the WNK Systems
In the present study, WNK1
KD with WNK463 was taken from the crystallographic structure (PDB
ID: 5DRB),24 while keeping all the crystal water molecules.
The following systems were investigated: (i) unphosphorylated complex,
designated as uWNK (ii) phosphorylated complex, where Ser382 was modified to phosphorylated form, designated as pWNK, and (iii)
double-phosphorylated system, where Ser382 and Ser378 were phosphorylated and designated as 2pWNK. Also, Apo-unphosphorylated
(u-Apo) and Apo-phosphorylated (p-Apo) systems were studied. To understand
the phosphorylation-induced conformational changes, we have simulated
the above systems for 1 μs and also investigated the ligand-binding
onto the structural conformation.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations
of all the systems were carried out using Amber16 MD package.56 All simulations were performed using GTX-1070
GPU. Amber ff14SB force field57 was used
to describe proteins. The phosphorylated serine was described using
phosaa10 force field.58 Generalized Amber
force field59 was used for the ligand,
and AM1-BCC60 atomic charges were calculated
using the antechamber61 module of Amber.56 Each system was placed in an octahedron periodic
box with a distance of 10 Å from the walls and solvated using
a TIP3P62 water model. Then, the systems
were neutralized by adding an appropriate number of Cl–/Na+ ions. SHAKE63 algorithm
was used to constrain the hydrogen atoms. The system’s temperature
was maintained at 300 K using a Langevin thermostat.64 The long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated
using the particle-mesh Ewald65 scheme
involving nonbonding interactions cutoff at 10 Å. Simulations
of all the systems were performed as follows: first, minimization
was run for 500 steps with the steepest descent and then 500 steps
of a conjugate gradient algorithm restraining the solute. Then, the
second minimization was run without any restraint for 100 steps using
the steepest descent followed by another 900 steps using the conjugate
gradient method. Further, equilibration was performed with positional
restraint of 5 kcal mol–1 Å–2 under NVT ensemble at 300 K for 50 ps. Then, under NPT ensemble simulations were performed for 50 ps at 1 atm
using Berendsen barostat.66 Subsequently,
without any restraint, the systems were equilibrated for 1 ns. Finally,
the production run was performed for 1 μs under NPT at 300 K and 1 atm without any restraint. We have used a time-step
of 2 fs. Coordinates were saved every 10 ps, leading to 100 000
configurations.

MM-PBSA Calculation
The binding
affinity in terms of
binding free energy of the complexes was evaluated in explicit water
using the MM-PBSA method.67−73 For the free energy calculation, 10 000 frames from the last
200 ns of simulations were taken for the calculation of binding free
energy using the following equation 1  where Gcomplex, Greceptor, and Gligand in eq 1 represent the
average Gibbs free energy for the complex, receptor,
and ligand, respectively. Summation of the molecular mechanic’s
free energy (ΔEMM), the solvation
free energy (ΔGsol), and the entropy
(TΔS) describe the Gibbs free
energy as 2  

Molecular mechanic’s energy
(EMM) can further be decomposed into 3  where Ecov, Eelec, and EvdW represent
the covalent, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions, respectively.
Further, the covalent component includes the bond energy (Ebond), the angular vibrational energy (Eangle), and the dihedral angle energies (Edihedral). The solvation free energy (ΔGsol)71,74 comprises polar as
well the nonpolar free-energy component given by 4  

The polar contributions (Gpol) are
obtained from the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation with dielectric
constants of 1.0 and 80.0 for the solute and solvent, respectively.
The nonpolar solvation free energy Gnp is estimated from the solvent-accessible surface area or SASA as
given by 5  where γ = 0.00542 kcal·mol–1 Å and b = 0. SASA was calculated
with a probe radius of 1.4 Å by using a fast–linear combination
of pairwise overlap algorithm.75 The normal
mode analysis76 was used to calculate the
entropy (SMM) part and for which 20 configurations
were taken from the last 200 ns simulations.

Structural Network Analysis
The structural network
was constructed via the NAPS portal.47 The
last trajectory of the simulations was used for the representative
structures. NAPS provides an interactive visualization of the PCNs.
The construction of networks can be done based on Cα, Cβ, atom pairs, centroid network, or interaction-strength
network. Here, in the network, the nodes are represented by the Cα atom of the amino acid residues and the edge between
Cα–Cα pair of residues is
drawn with a threshold distance taken as Rc (∼7 Å). Floyd–Warshall algorithm77 was used to calculate the shortest path between the residues
in the network. The parameter of the shortest path is considered to
describe the long-range interactions in proteins,78,79 whereas the shortest path is defined by the minimum number of nodes
required to reach from one node to other. The betweenness of a node
represents the global/local centrality of the node represented by
the number of shortest paths passing through the given node in a network.
The residue connectivity for uWNK, pWNK, as well as for apo systems
is shown by the betweenness parameter to show the structural rearrangements
of the binding pocket induced upon phosphorylation as well as by the
inhibitor binding.

Principal Component Analysis
PCA80 describes the functional significance of correlated
motions.
The covariance matrix from the atomic fluctuations of protein is diagonalized
and represented in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues that represent
the sets of principal components which could be used to describe the
motions.81 The direction of motions is
represented by the eigenvectors, and the amplitude of motions is given
by the corresponding eigenvalues. Our analysis yielded 3 × N, 3 × 273 = 819 eigenvectors.

Dihedral Principal Component
Analysis
It is a modified
form of PCA which employs internal coordinates, such as dihedral angles
(φ, ψ) instead of cartesian coordinates.82 For the biomolecular study, considerations of dihedral
angles are more appealing than bond angles and bond lengths as they
do not undergo much change. Previously, Mu et al.82 had shown that the Cartesian coordinate based PCA would
not provide an appropriate FEL as it would not differentiate between
internal and overall motions. On the other hand, dPCA considers the
dihedral angles of proteins that help to distinguish the motions between
the internal and overall dynamic motions and would construct the FEL
involving large structural changes. The free energy surface is described
with the first two eigenvectors (v1,v2) as 6  where P(v1,v2) represents
the probability distribution obtained from the
MD simulations and Pmax denotes the maximum
of distribution, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the temperature (300 K).
