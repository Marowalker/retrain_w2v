The difficulty of
processing two-dimensional (2D) transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) materials into working devices with any scalability
is one of the largest impediments to capitalizing on their industrial
promise. Here, we describe a versatile, simple, and scalable technique
to directly grow self-contacted thin-film materials over a range of
TMDs (MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2), where predeposited bulk metallic contacts serve as the
nucleation site for the TMD material to grow, forming naturally contacted
device structures in a single step. The conditions for growth as well
as optical and physical properties are reported. Because the material
grows controllably around the lithographically defined patterns, wafer
scale circuits and complex device geometries can be envisioned, including
lateral heterostructures of different TMD materials.

Introduction
In the monolayer limit,
some of the most studied transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), including MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, display a direct band gap,
large spin–orbit coupling, and broken inversion symmetry. These
characteristics, in addition to enhancing its linear and nonlinear
optical and electronic properties, may provide novel material-enabled
functionality in emerging areas such as spintronics or valleytronics.1−7 Early devices such as ultrasensitive photodetectors and high-mobility
transistors have shown promising results;8−12 however, nearly every seminal result in two-dimensional
(2D) material-based device fabrication has followed a standard procedure,
which is to isolate the monolayer material, often through mechanical
exfoliation and produce a one-off device using e-beam lithography
and metal deposition, an extremely challenging process to scale. Chemical
vapor deposition (CVD), which had been successfully used for large-scale
graphene production,13 has emerged as one
of the most promising and preferred processes for TMD synthesis.14−21 Typically, because of random nucleation, the location, number, and
size of the crystals grown are not controllable. However, CVD growth
of continuous thin films has been reported using different techniques,
such as seeding the substrate with aromatic molecules, which has been
found to produce high-quality, large-area, monolayer growth on a variety
of substrates.16,18,20,22−27 Another promising technique involves the deposition of thin films
of metal or metal oxide, which are then sulfurized directly or in
the presence of an additional oxide precursor.15,21,28−33 The predeposited films may be patterned, providing a degree of control
over the TMD film location; however, the predeposited metal or metal
oxide films are completely consumed during the growth, leaving an
isolated, and uncontacted, TMD layer where the film had been. Therefore,
even using CVD techniques, devices are fabricated postgrowth and almost
always in a manner which is neither straightforward nor scalable,
typically involving a combination of etching, transfer, lithography
and metal deposition, and often requiring further processing to obtain
good metal–semiconductor contacts.

We have reported a
versatile, simple, and scalable method for reproducibly
creating as-grown 2D material-based devices.34 However, the process demonstrated a moderate yield of around 50%
for complete thin-film coverage between patterns and had only been
confirmed for sulfur-based TMDs. We report here a study of modifications
that result in a higher-yield, large-area process to grow mono-to-few
layer MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, where the shape, size, and location of the TMD material
are determined by the predefined transition metal patterns. We also
report the observation that, under specific conditions, the growth
is selective regarding the type of transition metal used for the contact,
for example with MoS2 growing only on Mo and WS2 on W. The materials produced display strong luminescence and monolayer
Raman signatures, indicating high optical quality 2D material deterministically
and selectively over large regions. While the primary focus of this
work is describing the process for producing thin films over a range
of TMDs and presenting the optical and physical characterization of
the films, basic current-versus-voltage (IV) measurements
show conduction through the material, indicating a path to producing
as-grown metallic contacts for simple device fabrication and large-scale
production. In the following sections, we present details of the growth
process and materials characterization for the four most prominent
TMDs, MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, produced using this technique.

Growth Process
Metallic patterns of either Mo or W
were produced using direct current sputtering (thickness of 160 ±
10 nm) and a basic lift-off lithography process. After removal of
the photoresist, the samples were cleaned using de-ionized water,
acetone, and isopropanol. The TMD material growth was performed using
a one-inch tube furnace at atmospheric pressure,34,35 and a summary of the parameters used for the growths characterized
in this work is displayed in Table 1.

MoSe2	0.5	30	5	3	780	(15% H2)/Ar

A mass of
0.5 mg or less of MoO3 (1 mg or less of WO3)
powder was placed on a graphite holder along with the target
substrate, which was placed with the metallic pattern facing down
on the same holder 1–2 cm downstream from the powder. The graphite
holder was placed in the center of the furnace, while a boron nitride
boat containing the chalcogen was positioned just outside the furnace.
The furnace was ramped up to the growth temperature in three stages:
first to 550 °C where it remained for 5 min, then to 650 °C
for 10 min, and finally to the growth temperature, 780 °C for
Mo-based TMD growth and 850 °C for W-based TMD growth. When the
furnace reached the growth temperature, the tube was shifted such
that the chalcogen boat was at a predetermined distance from the edge
of the furnace where the temperature was measured to be 200 °C
for sulfur or 400 °C for selenium. A continuous flow of argon
was maintained at 50 sccm during the first 5 min temperature ramp,
and the flow was then lowered to 3 sccm until the sample is removed.
For the selenide-based growth, a mixture of H2/Ar was used
during the low flow period of the process. The growth time, which
was typically between 5 and 10 min, was measured from when the selenium
or sulfur started to melt. At the conclusion of the growth, the furnace
was turned off and allowed to cool naturally back to room temperature.

This process is based on a typical CVD reaction involving a chalcogen
and transition metal oxide-based precursor. For example, when utilizing
an oxide precursor for growth of MoS2, the process relies
on the reduction of MoO3 to the suboxide MoO3–x, followed by the replacement of oxygen by vaporized
sulfur. This multistep reaction is shown in eqs 1 and 2 below.36 1   2  

Interactions between the initial reactants in eq 1 take place after both are heated from their
solid form, after which an inert gas delivers the reactants to each
other. It has been theorized that there are two possible and perhaps
simultaneous deposition scenarios taking place: one in which the MoO3–x suboxide is adsorbed on the substrate
prior to their sulfurization and another in which the suboxide vapor
and sulfur vapor react while being delivered to finally adsorb and
nucleate on the substrate. While the exact ratio is difficult to predict,
the relative prevalence of both processes is affected by the temperature
and location of the substrate and reactants.37 Presumably, it is also affected by the rate at which the reactants
are delivered to each other and the substrate. One advantage of using
bulk metallic patterns is that despite the complex nature of thin-film
TMD growth via CVD, consistent and reproducible materials growth is
achievable. After refining the process, over 90% of the growth runs
resulted in mono-to-few layer material deterministically localized
between, and attached to, the metallic patterns. Though there have
been reports of using patterned graphene electrodes in a similar manner,
to nucleate 2D TMD material,38−40 here we observe that the specific
metal deposited has an additional effect on the growth process. Though
the details are still being investigated, the metallic patterns are
playing an active role beyond simply serving as a nucleation site.

Results and Discussion
Optical images in Figure 1 provide a comparison of the
four TMD material growths done
following the parameters outline in Table 1. For MoS2, shown in Figure 1a, optical contrast
indicates a region of monolayer material roughly 5 μm out from
the molybdenum contacts with few-to-multilayer material near the metallic
contacts as well as at the edge of the material. For WS2 and WSe2, the optical images [Figure 1b,d] show two tungsten contacts separated
by 16 and 20 μm, respectively, with films of WS2 and
WSe2 extending out and joining. In these two tungsten-based
growths, significant monolayer regions are seen with multilayer material
becoming predominant near the contact and spreading out. Similarly,
for MoSe2, shown in Figure 1c, a significant amount of monolayer material is observed
with multilayer material forming near the contacts and spreading outward.
A pixel-by-pixel analysis of the optical contrast for the images in Figure 1 gives ratios of
monolayer-to-multilayer material of 21% for MoS2, 32% for
WS2, 56% for MoSe2, and 30% for WSe2. Qualitatively, the ratio of the monolayer-to-multilayer material
is consistent for multiple samples grown under the described conditions.
The competing processes of lateral versus vertical growth of the TMD
material is still under investigation; however, for different growth
parameters (not shown here), such as shorter growth time or different
contact separations, a predominantly monolayer region between the
contacts is achievable as is observed in the WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2 growths. Polarization-resolved second
harmonic generation on samples grown under similar conditions has
shown that the films are polycrystalline with domain sizes on the
order of a few microns squared.34 As seen
in Figure 1, for all
the growths, the material grows out from the contacts and merges in
the middle. Though the atomistic details of this interface are currently
under investigation, optically they often appear continuous. Simple IV measurements, discussed below, also indicate that they
are electrically connected and support transport through the as-grown
film.

Figure 1 Optical images for the four TMD growths. (a) MoS2 grown
on Mo contacts display a region of monolayer material approximately
5 μm out from the contact. (b) WS2 grown on W contacts,
(c) MoSe2 grown on Mo contacts, and (d) WSe2 grown on W contacts all show large areas of continuous monolayer
material between the contacts where the material meets, unlike the
MoS2 example shown. All images show multilayer material
growing out from the contacts. The scale bars are all 10 μm.

In bulk form, TMDs have an indirect
gap with energy in the near-infrared.
As the number of layers is reduced, the indirect gap shifts to higher
energy with an indirect-to-direct gap crossover occurring in the monolayer
limit with two distinct excitonic features, A and B, which arise from
the large spin–orbit splitting in the valence band. This results
in the excitonic photoluminescence (PL) intensity increasing, typically
by at least an order of magnitude, when comparing monolayer material
to multilayer material. Additionally, certain Raman modes of each
TMD are highly affected by the number of layers; therefore, both PL
and Raman are widely used for quantifying the layer number. PL and
Raman measurements taken in representative areas are shown in Figure 2 and were performed
using a Witec confocal Raman system using a 532 nm laser with the
power held at ∼0.5 mW. The PL intensity is plotted on a log
scale to reveal any relatively weak exciton peaks, such as the B exciton
for MoS2. The PL for the monolayer regions of MoS2 shows strong PL with a very low B/A intensity ratio indicative of
a high-quality growth with low defect density.41,42 The A1g and E2g1 lines in the Raman spectra show an absolute
separation of 21 cm–1 for the monolayer regions
consistent with other CVD grown monolayer material.43,44 For WS2, the intense PL for the A exciton is located
at 630 nm while the B exciton is higher in energy than our excitation
laser (532 nm).18,45 Monolayer WS2 displays
a strong 2LA Raman mode at 351 cm–1 and a weak A1g mode at 417.5 cm–1, where, with increasing
number of layers, the 2LA mode is red-shifted while the A1g mode is blue-shifted, causing the separation between the two modes
to increase from 66.5 cm–1 for monolayer to 69 cm–1 for multilayer.46 The
PL spectrum of MoSe2 [Figure 2a] shows the characteristic A excitonic state
for different numbers of layers. The low energy A exciton is typically
the most intense peak, centered around 821 nm, and shows a more than
1 order of magnitude increase in intensity when comparing a few-layer
region to a monolayer region. For MoSe2, Figure 2b displays the out-of-plane
A1g Raman mode located around 240.5 cm–1 in the case of monolayer, which is blue-shifted to 241.3 cm–1 for few-layer material, and the in-plane E2g1 mode (287 cm–1 for monolayer) with weaker intensity that is red-shifted
to 285.8 cm–1 for few-layer material, in agreement
with previous studies.47 Finally, for WSe2, the A exciton is located at 760 nm for the monolayer, while
the B exciton around 600 nm is significantly weaker. The Raman signal
displays the expected modes for monolayer WSe2, namely
E2g1 at 250
cm–1 for monolayer that blue-shifts for 2 layers
and A1g at 260 cm–1 for monolayer which
shows a small red shift for 2 layers.48

confocal Raman instrument with 532 nm excitation held at ∼0.5
mW.

Unlike traditional device fabrication
where the material synthesis
and contact formation are separate processes, here both are produced
concurrently. This provides a potentially significant advantage for
large scale production; however, it does make isolating the contact
versus material properties a challenge. For example, it is likely
that oxidation of the transition metal pattern during the process,
along with the potential formation of other transition metal complexes,
adds complexity to the contact structure. Additionally, with the current
sample structures, the metallic patterns in the regions with thin-film
growth extend out to large (50 μm × 50 μm) contact
pads, all consisting of the same transition metal, and it is found
that layers of semiconducting TMD form on the metallic contacts. This,
along with the possible formation of a transition metal-based silicide
under the patterns, make it difficult to produce gated devices and
to isolate the metal–TMD contact. We are currently investigating
the incorporation of a diffusion barrier and methods to maintain pristine
surfaces using nonreactive metals in selective areas for external
contacting along with systematically studying the formation of oxides
on the transition metal patterns. Despite these complications, simple
current versus voltage (IV) measurements clearly
show current passing through the material, confirming that electrical
contact is being made between the deposited patterns of transition
metal and the subsequently grown thin-films. These measurements were
performed on a set of materials grown on quartz substrates to eliminate
the possibility of leakage current through the SiO2 to
the doped silicon substrate. Though all the samples displayed a general
Schottky contact, metal–semiconductor–metal, type of
behavior as shown in Figure 3, given the unique nature of this growth/contacting method,
further consideration of contact formation and device structure, beyond
the scope of the current work, are necessary to fully understand the
electrical properties.

Figure 3 Current vs voltage (IV) measurements
demonstrate
a Schottky contact, metal–semiconductor–metal, behavior.
Though the absolute variation between the various types of TMD is
large, variations within a specific type are typically within a factor
of 10.

An intriguing prospect for this
technique is the ability to produce
complex device architectures, including lateral heterostructures.
An example of this is shown in Figure 4, where separate Mo and W contacts were produced using
a two-step lithography process [Figure 4a inset]. This structure was subjected to a hybrid
growth process, where MoO3 and WO3 precursors
were simultaneously placed in the furnace along with the substrate
and sulfur in a configuration like that described in the above Experiment
section. With a growth temperature of 850 °C, used for W-based
materials, it was found that lateral heterostructures would form [Figure 4a]. PL and Raman
measurements indicate that the material around the Mo contact, such
as at Position 1 in Figure 4b, is purely MoS2 and around the W contact, such
as at Position 3 in Figure 4b, is WS2. The transition region, where both MoS2 and WS2 Raman peaks appear [Position 2 in Figure 4b], occurs over a
length comparable to our experimental resolution (∼1 μm),
so we are currently unable to determine the details of the junction.
However, the fact that only MoS2 (WS2) grows
around the Mo (W) implies that there is selectivity with regard to
the nucleation and growth process. In a previous study, under different
growth conditions, it was demonstrated that using one type of transition
metal contact, W for example, with a different transition metal oxide,
MoO3 for example, would result in the formation of vertical
heterostructures.34 These results indicate
that complex structures may be selectively grown through systematic
control of the metal, precursors, and growth conditions.

Figure 4 (a) Lateral
heterostructure formed from two different transition
metal patterns. Here, Mo and W contacts were subjected to growth parameters
used for a typical WS2 growth but with both MoO3 and WO3 precursors present. (b,c) Raman and PL spectra
indicate an abrupt transition, where the spatial separation between
the three positions indicated is 1 μm.

Conclusions
In summary, we report a versatile, simple, and
scalable technique
to directly grow self-contacted thin-film devices for TMD materials
including MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2, where the shape, size, and location of the TMD material
are determined by the predefined transition metal patterns. The materials
produced display strong luminescence and monolayer Raman signatures,
indicating high-quality materials with significant percentages of
monolayer coverage. The material grows out from the metallic contacts
with large crystal domains, merging and forming a continuous film
as determined optically and electronically. It was also observed that,
under certain conditions, the growth is selective regarding the type
of transition metal used for the contact, with MoS2 growing
only on Mo and WS2 on W, opening the possibility for complex
device geometries including heterostructures of different TMD materials.
