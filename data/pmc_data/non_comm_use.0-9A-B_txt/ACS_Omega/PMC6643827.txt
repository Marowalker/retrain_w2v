Third-order
liquid chromatographic data were generated online for
the simultaneous quantitation of six organic environmental pollutants.
The employed strategy consists in reducing the linear flow rate at
the column outlet. A postcolumn UV reactor and a fluorimetric detector
allowed to properly record both photoinduced and native excitation–emission
fluorescence matrices (EEPIFMs and EEFMs, respectively). The obtained
third-order liquid chromatography data were chemometrically processed
with the multivariate curve resolution–alternating least-squares
model. The sensitivity of the overall analytical method was enhanced
by a very simple solid-phase extraction with C18 membranes, to be
able to successfully apply it to natural water samples tested as real
matrices. Favorable detection limits for the investigated pollutants,
ranging from 0.02 to 0.27 ng mL–1, were attained,
with relative prediction errors between 2 and 7%. Since the studied
samples contain uncalibrated interferents, the applied strategy achieves
the second-order advantage. Implications regarding the potential achievement
of the third-order advantage are discussed.

Introduction
Relevant advantages
of multiway calibration from different types
of analytical signals have been widely discussed in the literature.1−5 It is worth mentioning the following benefits: (1) analytes can
be quantitated in the presence of uncalibrated interferents (second-order
advantage),6 (2) sample pretreatment is
greatly simplified, and only pure analyte calibration sets are needed,
and (3) selectivity and sensitivity are significantly increased.7 Specifically, third-order/four-way calibration
possesses the additional benefit of the so-called “third-order
advantage”, which refers to its ability of resolving compounds
with collinear profiles.8−10 Third-order/four-way data can
be obtained, for example, from excitation–emission fluorescence
matrices (EEFMs) as a function of liquid chromatographic (LC) elution
time.11 Although different strategies have
been proposed to record this type of data, an easy way for generating
EEFMs during the chromatographic run (e.g., online measurement) has
been recently proposed.10 The approach
consisted in reducing the linear flow rate (LFR) to increase the width
of each chromatographic peak. Thus, EEFMs were measured without significant
variations of the local analyte concentration when changing the excitation
wavelength for EEFM collection. This reduction of the LFR, without
modifying the volumetric flow rate (VFR), was achieved by fitting
a larger diameter connecting tube between the column outlet and the
fluorimetric detector.10 Consequently,
many matrices per chromatographic peak, without dependence between
the data in the excitation and time modes, were successfully registered
online.11

In the present work, following
this concept and with the purpose
of measuring excitation–emission photoinduced fluorescence
matrices (EEPIFMs) of contaminants that do not exhibit native signals,
additionally to a larger diameter connecting tube, a postcolumn photoreactor
constituted by a tube coiled to a UV lamp was introduced.

The
studied analytes included agrochemicals and emerging pollutants
representative of therapeutic drugs, which are potentially present
in environmental samples and with adverse ecological and human health
effects.12−16 The investigated agrochemicals, whose structures are shown in Figure 1, were rimsulfuron
[RIM; 1-(4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-3-(3-ethylsulfonyl pyridin-2-yl)sulfonylurea;
herbicide], fuberidazole [FBZ; 2-(2-furyl)-1H-benzimidazole;
fungicide], and carbaryl [CBL; 1-naphthyl methylcarbamate; insecticide].
The emerging pollutants were represented by naproxen [NAP; (S)-(+)-6-methoxy-α-methyl-2-naphthalene acetic acid;
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory], albendazole [ALB; methyl-[(5-propylthio)-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl] carbamate; antihelminthic agent] and
tamoxifen [TAM; trans-1-(4-β-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenyl-1-butene;
anticancer agent].

Figure 1 Structures of the studied analytes.

Some of the selected compounds display native fluorescence,
whereas
others only show emission signals upon UV irradiation; these properties
were useful in the present context for their quantitation. As will
be demonstrated, the obtained LC-EEFM and LC-EEPIFM third-order data
could not be arranged as a four-way array complying with the quadrilinearity
condition, and thus multivariate curve resolution–alternating
least squares (MCR–ALS)17 was applied
for data treatment.

The challenges presented by the selected
system within the framework
of green analytical chemistry are analyzed and discussed, namely,
(1) the simultaneous quantitation of pollutants with different spectroscopic
properties, (2) the optimization of the experimental conditions considering
the analytical goals, (3) the correct measurement of proper online
third-order chromatographic data, and (4) the successful resolution
of a system with severe spectral overlapping and high collinearity
in the chromatographic profiles.

Results and Discussion
Luminescent
Properties of Analytes
Among the studied
analytes, RIM and TAM exhibit virtually no native fluorescence. However,
both show fluorescence bands upon irradiation. The sulfonylurea bridge
in the RIM molecule is photochemically cleaved on both sides of the
carbonyl group yielding a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and an aryl
sulfonamide, which are thought to be responsible for the observed
fluorescence, although the structures of breakdown photoproducts have
not been yet characterized (Figure 2A).18 On the other hand,
after UV irradiation of TAM, a main fluorescent phenanthrene derivative
is formed by photocyclization, with maxima at ca. 365 and 390 nm (Figure 2B).19,20

Figure 2 Photoinduced
reactions suggested for RIM (A) and TAM (B).

The remaining four analytes are naturally fluorescent, presenting
specific behaviors after UV irradiation. As has already been reported,
the strong fluorescence of both NAP and FBZ decrease after being photoirradiated,21,22 and the photochemical decomposition of CBL in acetonitrile (ACN), induced by continuous UV radiation,
follows a degradation pathway different from that reported in aqueous
medium producing phthalic anhydride, 1,4-naphtalenedione, and 1-naphthol.23 However, the fluorescence intensity of these
latter three analytes does not change over time in our experimental
conditions, indicating that they are not being degraded, at least
to a significant degree. Depending on the solvent, ALB displays fluorescence
with maxima in the range of 440–470 nm,24 and after irradiation under the studied conditions a photoproduct
is formed, emitting at 310 nm.

In conclusion, RIM, TAM, and
ALB were evaluated through the EEPIFMs
collected for their photoproducts, whereas for NAP, FBZ, and CBL the
native fluorescence signals were employed.

Optimization of Experimental
Conditions
The most relevant
experimental variables affecting both chromatographic and spectroscopic
profiles are interdependent. They were optimized to achieve the following
goals: (1) a certain resolution in a relatively short time, (2) a
minimum solvent consumption, and (3) promotion of photoproduct formation
without affecting the signals of the analytes whose native fluorescence
could decrease with irradiation.

Furthermore, a suitable number
of excitation–emission matrices should be registered during
the elution of the sample (e.g., 6–8 matrices for each chromatographic
band), and they should have a proper number of excitation and emission
data points for adequate processing. In fact, in a typical experiment,
when trying to measure EEFMs of a moving sample, the excitation spectrum
of each analyte changes in shape as a function of measurement time.11 As previously demonstrated, this mutual dependence
between excitation and time profiles can be avoided by decreasing
the LFR through the increase of the flowing tube diameter connecting
the column outlet with the detector.10 In
the present work, a postcolumn photoreactor and an additional tube
between the photoreactor and the cell were inserted. In this way,
the LFR was decreased at a constant VFR, allowing the collection of
a suitable number of EEFMs without significantly increasing the total
analysis time.

The photoreactor dimensions and the VFR were
modified with the
purpose of achieving maximum intensities of the PIF signals, taking
into account that (1) the signal for the nonfluorescent analytes RIM
and TAM increased with the irradiation time and then remained approximately
constant and (2) the irradiation time depends on the photoreactor
length and the VFR. Two photoreactor lengths (250 and 500 cm) and
VFRs in the range 0.4 and 1 mL min–1 were probed.
It was corroborated that a 500 cm photoreactor length and a VFR of
0.7 mL min–1 produced the most sensitive signals
without altering the signals of the remaining analytes. Different
lengths, from 10 to 50 cm, of the additional tube of 1.6 mm internal
diameter, were tested, and the final dimensions were set for obtaining
a time width at least of 2 min.

The composition of the
mobile phase (solvents and pH) has an influence
on the retention time as well as on both the extension of the photoreaction
and the fluorescence intensity.25 Because
the fluorescence signals of the studied analytes in methanol were
less intense than in ACN, mobile phases containing different ratios
of ACN and buffer solution were tested. The selected buffer was an
acetate/acetic acid solution of pH = 5.5, since our exploratory experiments
proved that a slightly acidic pH produced satisfactory signals.

A schematic diagram of the employed equipment is shown in Figure 3, and a summary of
the experimental conditions applied for the determination of the evaluated
analytes is given in Table 1. Notice the additional connecting tube having an internal
diameter, which is larger than the remaining tubes, and the presence
of a back-pressure regulator, which prevents bubbles and improves
baseline stability.

Figure 4A shows
the excitation and emission spectra of the analytes after photoirradiation
and their chromatographic behavior under the selected working conditions.
The spectral overlapping and co-elution among the calibrated analytes
are clear in this figure. It is apparent that the situation would
be further complicated in real samples with unknown constituents.

The increasing complexity from a pure analyte sample and
a real
matrix can be visualized in Figure 5 through the contour plots of selected EEFMs at different
chromatographic elution time.

(A) and for a river sample added with the studied analytes (B).

Validation Samples
In addition to the mutual dependence
between excitation and time profiles of LC-EEFM and LC-EEPIFM third-order
data measured in real-time with a single equipment, elution time shifts
or shape changes may occur between successive chromatographic runs.11 In the present system, loss of quadrilinearity
due to lack of reproducibility in elution times was detected, and
therefore MCR–ALS was conveniently applied with matrix superaugmentation
in the temporal direction.17

For
MCR–ALS data processing, superaugmented matrices were built
with the three-dimensional data arrays for each of the 12 validation
samples and all of the calibration samples, after unfolding them to
matrices whose modes were (1) the elution time mode and (2) the concatenations
of excitation and emission modes, as explained in the Supporting Information. Baseline correction of
each submatrix of the superaugmented matrix was performed using a
homemade routine based on asymmetric least-squares.26 Nine components, corresponding to the six analytes and
three background signals, were estimated by applying principal component
analysis.17 The profiles employed as initial
approximations for starting MCR–ALS were estimated as the purest
variables in the concatenated excitation–emission spectral
domain. Non-negativity in both augmented and nonaugmented modes, unimodality
constraint in the time profile, and area correlation and correspondence
between components and samples were applied.27 After convergence of the ALS optimization, the nonaugmented profiles
were refolded to retrieve individual excitation and emission profiles,
which are adequate for spectral interpretation. Analytes were then
identified by their spectral profiles, and quantitation was performed
using each of the univariate calibration curves. The latter was built
from analyte scores (areas of the elution time profiles) for the calibration
samples. The test analyte score was then interpolated in the calibration
line (see Supporting Information for additional
details).

The good quality of the MCR–ALS-recovered spectral
and temporal
profiles can be appreciated in Figure 4B, and Figure 6 displays the satisfactory prediction results for the evaluated
analytes in validation samples. The latter figure also shows the elliptical
joint confidence region for the slope and intercept of the plot, predicted
as a function of nominal concentrations, allowing for a statistical
analysis of the predictions.28 Because
the obtained elliptical domains include the theoretically predicted
values for the slope and the intercept (slope = 1 and intercept =
0), the accuracy of the methodology is confirmed.

as a function of the nominal values in validation samples and the
corresponding elliptical joint region (at 95% confidence level) for
the slope and intercept of the regression of the data. The red cross
marks the theoretical (intercept = 0, slope = 1) point.

A relevant challenge of the analyzed system is
the almost complete
co-elution between the pairs FBZ–NAP and CBL–ALB (Figure 4A). However, this
high degree of collinearity was successfully overcome by the applied
MCR–ALS model (Figure 4B). As in other similar systems processed by third-order/four-way
models, the resolution of highly collinear profiles supports the achievement
of the third-order advantage.8−10 Figures of merit, calculated
according to the suggestion of Bauza et al.,29 and statistical indicators for validation samples are shown in Table 2. The good resolution
achieved is in agreement with the reasonably high selectivity values
quoted in the latter table.

It is important to notice that
in second-order chromatographic
data with fluorescent detection at a constant excitation wavelength,
the latter should be selected as a compromise among the excitation
maxima of the various analytes. In contrast, in the presently discussed
third-order calibration process, the excitation wavelength is scanned
in an appropriate range during the measurements. This increases the
method sensitivity because each analyte is irradiated at a number
of wavelengths, including its spectral maximum.

Real Samples
The usefulness of the proposed method
was tested by analyzing natural water susceptible to contamination
by organic pollutants. Although collection proceeded near urban areas,
the analytes were not detected in these samples, and a recovery study
by spiking them with the studied analytes at four different fortification
levels was performed.

The European Community has stated that
maximum admissible concentration levels for each pesticide and for
the total amount in drinking water are 0.1 and 0.5 ng mL–1, respectively.30 On the other hand, although
the presence in natural water of NAP, TAM, and ALB is not regulated
by international agencies, levels in the order of sub-part-per-billions
are frequently found for these compounds in aquatic bodies, reaching
parts per billion in contaminated areas. NAP is one of the most commonly
found pharmaceutical pollutants in water and as recent examples we
remark NAP levels up to 0.55 ng mL–1 and up to 6.3
ng mL–1 detected in surface water and sewage treatment
plants, respectively, of urbanized zones of Italy, Spain, USA, and
Canada.13,15,21 Although information
related with environmental concentrations of ALB is limited,16 it is known that levels of anthelmintics in
water samples are mostly in the ng L–1 and ng mL–1 range.31 Very low concentrations
of TAM have been measured in different surface water (<0.07 ng
mL–1),15,32,33 but higher levels have been found in sewage treatment plants of
China (0.224 ng mL–1)34 and in a river water of the U.K. (0.212 ng mL–1).35 On the basis of the above considerations,
the sensitivity of the present method for water real samples was improved
using a preconcentration step by employing C18 membrane solid-phase
extraction (SPE).

Table 3 displays
the recovery results after spiking water samples with different analyte
amounts at four concentration levels. The significance was tested
employing the Student t-test: the null hypothesis
corresponds to the ideal 100% recovery.28 The obtained t values for n –
1 degrees of freedom (n is the number of concentration
levels) at a p value of 0.05 for the degree of confidence
are lower than the corresponding critical values, implying that the
proposed method is suitable for the analyte quantitation in the studied
samples.

Table 3 also includes
the statistical results corresponding to quantitation in real water
matrices. Limits of detection and quantitation reflect the benefits
of the preconcentration and the possibility of determining the studied
analytes at sub-part-per-billion levels. Besides, the relative error
of prediction is not affected by the fact that real matrices are being
studied. The advantages of the proposed method in comparison with
traditional chromatographic ones are especially noticeable in these
real samples, where both simple experimental and chemometric treatments
are required for obtaining high-quality results.

Conclusions
This work reports a novel strategy to obtain online third-order
chromatographic data for the simultaneous quantitation of fluorescent
analytes and those with fluorescent photoproducts.

The introduction
of both a photoreactor and a connecting tube of
large diameter between the column and the spectrofluorimeter allowed
the efficient collection, in parallel with the chromatographic procedure,
of excitation–emission fluorescence and photoinduced fluorescence
matrices. Thus, chromatographic third-order data are obtained online,
in less than 10 min, with the concomitant advantages of this type
of data. Due to the favorable characteristics of high sensitivity,
selectivity, collinearity resolution, and saving of experimental time,
the method represents a better alternative than both univariate- and
second-order calibration. It may also be preferable to offline chromatographic
third-order calibration methods. According to the properties of the
studied data, MCR–ALS was selected for chemometric processing.
This latter model showed a very good performance to quantitate the
analytes even in the presence of unknown constituents. Finally, this
report is a new example of the power and applicability of high-order
calibration in complex system, maintaining the principles of the green
analytical chemistry.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Materials
RIM and NAP were obtained from
Fluka (St. Louis), and FBZ was purchased from Riedel-de Haën
(Seelze, Germany). CBL, ALB, and TAM were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis). Acetic acid was provided by Sintorgán (Buenos
Aires, Argentina) and sodium acetate by Cicarelli (San Lorenzo, Argentina).
ACN was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Milli-Q water (Millipore,
Bedford) was used in all experiments. Stock solutions of analytes
in the range 200–500 mg L–1 were prepared
in ACN. From these solutions, more diluted ACN solutions (around 5–25
mg L–1) were obtained.

Instrumentation and Procedure
Chromatographic measurements
were performed on an Agilent 1200 liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies,
Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a quaternary pump and a thermostated
column compartment set at 35 °C. A Rheodyne valve with a 50.0
μL loop was employed to inject the sample on to a Restek Pinnacle
II-C8, 5 μm particle size, 30 mm length, 4.6 mm internal diameter
column (Restek, Bellefonte). A photoreactor, consisting of a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) tube network (5 m × 0.5 mm i.d.) coiled around a tubular
8 W low-pressure mercury lamp, was used for the postcolumn photoirradiation.
This light source emits the known mercury spectrum, including the
most intense line in the UV region at 254 nm, and because of the low
power rating of this light source, no cooling in the photoreactor
was required. A PTFE tube (16 cm) of 1.6 mm i.d. was used to connect
the photoreactor with the detector. PTFE tubing of 0.3 mm i.d. was
used for all of the remaining connections. The data were collected
using the software HP ChemStation for LC Rev. HP 1990–1997.

The chromatographic analysis was performed using a mixture of 20
mmol L–1 of sodium acetate/acetic acid buffer pH
5.5 (solvent A) and ACN (solvent B) as mobile phase. An elution gradient
program was employed: linear gradient from 65% A:35% B to 100% B,
0–4.5 min, isocratic elution with 100% B until 12 min. The
mobile phase composition was brought back to the initial conditions,
and after a reconditioning period of 4 min, the next sample was injected.
Samples were filtered through 0.22 μm nylon membranes before
injection. The VFR was maintained at 0.7 mL min–1. An Agilent Cary-Eclipse luminescence spectrometer (Agilent Technologies,
Waldbronn, Germany) was used as detector, employing an 8 μL
quartz flow cell (Starna, CA) of 1 mm optical path. The excitation
and emission slit widths were, respectively, 10 and 20 nm, the photomultiplier
sensitivity was 900 V, and spectral scanning speed of 19 200
nm min–1 was applied. The cell temperature was regulated
at 20 °C using a thermostatic bath (Cole-Parmer, IL).

Chromatographic
data were collected from 2 to 12.5 min each 0.28
min, and EEFMs were recorded from 310 to 402 nm each 4 nm (emission)
and from 227 to 277 nm each 2.5 nm (excitation). The reading of each
EEFM required a time of approximately 17 s, allowing to register 38
EEFMs for each sample. In this way, data arrays of size 38 ×
24 × 21 for temporal, emission spectral, and excitation spectral
modes were, respectively, generated.

Calibration and Validation
Samples
A calibration set
of 19 samples was prepared (Table S1).
Some (12) of these samples corresponded to the concentrations provided
by the Plackett–Burman design, one sample was a blank solution,
and the remaining six samples included each pure analyte at the mean
concentration. The analytes were evaluated at the following concentration
ranges: 0–1000 ng mL–1 for both RIM and ALB,
0–500 ng mL–1 for TAM, 0–250 ng mL–1 for both FBZ and CBL, and 0–100 ng mL–1 for NAP. A validation set was prepared employing
concentrations different than those used for calibration and following
a random design (Table S2). Calibration
and validation samples were prepared immediately before their use
by taking appropriate aliquots of diluted ACN solutions, placing them
in 5.00 mL volumetric flasks, drying the solvent under nitrogen, and
completing to the mark with buffer (sodium acetate/acetic acid, pH
5.5)/ACN (65:35, v/v) solution.

Water Sample Procedure
Well and river water samples
were prepared by spiking them with standard solutions of the studied
analytes, obtaining concentration levels in the range 0.2–3
ng mL–1. These samples were filtered through 0.45
μm pore size nylon membranes. Samples were subjected to SPE
with C18 disks. Each disk was previously conditioned with 0.5 mL of
methanol and 1 mL of ultrapure water. Aliquots of 100 mL were passed
through the disks. After elution of the retained organic constituents
with methanol, the solvent was evaporated with nitrogen, the residue
was reconstituted with 400 μL of mobile phase, and the obtained
solutions were subjected to the same chromatographic analysis as the
validation samples. The preconcentration factor was 1:250.
