Oligonucleotides serve as important
tools for biological, chemical,
and medical research. The preparation of oligonucleotides through
automated solid-phase synthesis is well-established. However, identification
of byproducts generated from DNA synthesis, especially from oligonucleotides
containing site-specific modifications, is sometimes challenging.
Typical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry
(MS), and gel electrophoresis methods alone are not sufficient for
characterizing unexpected byproducts, especially for those having
identical or very similar molecular weight (MW) to the products. We
used a rigorous quality control procedure to characterize byproducts
generated during oligonucleotide syntheses: (1) purify oligonucleotides
by different HPLC systems; (2) determine exact MW by high-resolution
MS; (3) locate modification position by MS/MS or exonuclease digestion
with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight analysis;
and (4) conduct, where applicable, enzymatic assays. We applied these
steps to characterize byproducts in the syntheses of oligonucleotides
containing biologically important methyl DNA adducts 1-methyladenine
(m1A) and 3-methylcytosine (m3C). In m1A synthesis, we differentiated
a regioisomeric byproduct 6-methyladenine, which possesses a MW identical
to uncharged m1A. As for m3C, we identified a deamination byproduct
3-methyluracil, which is only 1 Da greater than uncharged m3C in the
∼4900 Da context. The detection of these byproducts would be
very challenging if the abovementioned procedure was not adopted.

Introduction
Oligonucleotides synthesized
chemically are widely used as drugs
and research tools in biology, chemistry, and medicine. Solid-phase
synthesis of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides has been well-developed,
and the automated phosphoramidite-based chemical process has become
highly efficient.1−3 Phosphoramidites of regular and some modified nucleotides
are commercially available, and certain oligonucleotide strands could
be readily obtained from commercial sources.4−7 Besides the great development
in the synthesis of oligonucleotides, the differentiation of byproducts
from the product oligonucleotides, especially on those containing
site-specifically modified structures, is sometimes ignored by the
end users. If those byproducts or small impurities were not identified
and removed, it could have devastating consequences for the corresponding
biological assays and medical treatments.8,9 For
certain instances, it is challenging to identify some byproducts generated
in the synthesis and deprotection steps, especially the byproduct
that has a molecular weight (MW) identical or very similar to the
desired product oligonucleotide.

We have synthesized various
oligonucleotides containing modified
structures in the past, focusing on alkyl or aryl DNA adducts, by
using solid- and solution-phase DNA synthesis.10−14 In the syntheses of oligonucleotides containing 1-methyladenine
(m1A) and 3-methylcytosine (m3C), we observed byproducts in a neutral
context that are either regioisomer (identical MW) to the product
or have 1 Da in MW greater than the product in a ∼4900 Da context
(Figure 1a). m1A and
m3C are formed by exogenous and endogenous alkylating agents mainly
in single-stranded DNA and have been detected both in vitro15−21 and in vivo.15,20,22−29 Both adducts are cytotoxic and block DNA replication and are the
best substrates for the AlkB family DNA repair enzymes (Figure 1b).30−34 m3C has also been proposed as an epigenetic biomarker
for cancer.35

and byproducts studied in this work. (a)
Structures of adducts and byproducts from chemical syntheses and (b)
the alkyl adduct m1A, as an example, is repaired in the presence of
the AlkB enzyme and necessary cofactors.

Most of our DNA syntheses successfully provided target oligonucleotides.
However, some oligonucleotides contained side reaction contaminants
generated during the synthesis or deprotection steps, requiring further
purification and identification. To that end, we applied a rigorous
quality control process which entails the following steps: (i) synthesize
an adduct-containing oligonucleotide from the corresponding phosphoramidite;
(ii) purify the product oligonucleotide by both reverse-phase and
anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); (iii)
measure the exact MW of the oligonucleotide by high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HR-MS), certain impurities can also be detected by HR-MS;
(iv) determine the modification position by either MS/MS or exonuclease
digestion with matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis; and (v) test the biological activity
of the adduct-containing oligonucleotide by appropriate enzymatic
assays. We are assuming that the modified nucleotide has been extensively
investigated for its stability under solid-phase chemical synthesis
and deprotection beforehand; however, the strategy outlined above
should confirm this. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR; 1H, 13C, and 31P) is a powerful tool for structural
integrity studies of the phosphoramidite on the milligram scale.36−38 However, NMR becomes impractical for characterizing minor impurities
within the modified structures in synthetic oligonucleotides because
of increasing spectral complexity, as well as the final amount of
material available (e.g. on a micro-mole or less scale). Below, we
report the detailed characterization of byproducts in the syntheses
of oligonucleotides containing m1A and m3C. The characterization and
separation of those byproducts provide confidence in the quality of
oligonucleotides used in further biological experiments.

Results
Identification
of the 6-Methyladenine Byproduct from m1A Synthesis
We were
trying to incorporate m1A into an oligonucleotide as a
substrate for the AlkB repair reaction.34,39 A 16mer oligonucleotide
containing m1A was prepared by using the commercially available phosphoramidite
of m1A (Figure 1a).
The final product was deprotected under standard conditions by treating
the crude oligonucleotide with ammonium hydroxide at 80 °C for
3 h. The oligonucleotide was then tested by both reverse-phase and
anion-exchange HPLC (see the Experimental Section for detailed conditions). The resulting chromatograms showed a single
peak under both conditions (retention time 10.2 min in Figure 2a and 4.0 min in Figure S22). HR electrospray ionization-time
of flight (ESI-TOF) MS analysis of the sample exhibited m/z at 1224.715 at its −4 charge state, which
is in good agreement with the theoretical m/z 1224.711 expected of the product oligonucleotide (Figures 3a and S1 and Table 1).

a For m1A and m3C syntheses, the sequence
of the 16mer was 5′-GAAGACCTXGGCGTCC-3′, where X indicates
the position of the modified bases.

Collision-induced dissociation (CID) MS/MS analysis
was used to
determine the location of the alkyl adduct in the synthesis of m1A-containing
16mer oligonucleotide (Figure 4). The MS/MS results, presented in detail in the Supporting Information (Figure S5 and Table S1),
confirmed that modification occurred at the eighth position from the
3′ end of the oligonucleotide, and the modified base had the
same MW as m1A. Analysis of 3′ end fragmentations indicated
that w15 to w8 fragments all contain an extra
methyl modification (Figure 4, Table S1, and Figure S10). On the other hand, w7 to w1 ions showed only standard DNA sequences without methyl modification
(Table S1). These results suggested that
the modification is located between w8 and w7, which is the eighth position from the 3′ end of the 16mer
oligonucleotide. From the 5′ fragmentations, we observed the
methyl modification in ions from (a15-C) to (a10-G), but no such modification in ions from (a9-X) to (a2-A) (Figures 4 and S9 and Table S1). These results suggested that the modification is located
between (a10-G) and (a9-X), which is the ninth
position from the 5′ end (Figure 4). The fragmentation patterns from both the
5′ and 3′ ends are consistent with the proposed m1A-containing
DNA sequence (Figure 4).

products from the m1A and m3C syntheses. X denotes the modified nucleotides.

To further confirm the location
of the modified base, we performed
enzyme digestion coupled with MALDI-TOF MS analysis.11−13,40,41 The procedure has been widely used to confirm the location of lesion
positions by determining the mass changes after partial digestion
from the 3′ end by the exonuclease snake venom phosphodiesterase
(SVP).42−44Figure 5 shows the positive ion MALDI-TOF MS spectra of the 3′ to
5′ SVP exonuclease digestion of the product oligonucleotide
at different time intervals. The m/z of 4904.2 at 0 min (before digestion, as a control) indicated that
the 16mer DNA sequence contained a methylated DNA base ([M+H]+ theoretical m/z = 4903.9
Da; herein theoretical m/z values
are shown in parentheses after the observed m/z values). After 1 min SVP digestion, while the product
ion disappeared, three new lower masses appeared at m/z = 4615.7 (4614.8), 4326.7 (4325.8), and 4022.7
(4021.7), which correspond to the 15, 14, and 13mer fragments generated
from 3′ cleavage, respectively (Figure 5). The signal intensity of three new peaks
were significantly increased with the disappearance of the original
product oligonucleotide ion at m/z = 4904.2.

Figure 5 Time-course MALDI-TOF analyses of SVP digestion products of the
16mer product oligonucleotide (containing m6A) generated from m1A
synthesis. Theoretical masses are listed in the inset. The theoretical
monoisotopic mass at 2745.5 is highlighted in red because it is the
smallest digestion product containing the modification.

Further digestion resulted in a number of smaller
fragments. In
the 3 min digestion (Figures 5 and S17), the signal of m/z = 3075.1 (3074.6) matches the sequence
for the fragment that was cleaved one base before the lesion. The m/z = 2746.4 (2745.5, containing a methyl
modification) represents the digestion occurring on the 3′
side of the modified adenine position (Figure 5), which also persisted in the 5 min digestion
spectrum. The signal at 2419.1 (2418.5, no methyl modification) in
the 3 and 5 min digestions represents the fragment generated after
liberation of deoxymethyladenosine 5′ monophosphate. Digestions
practically stopped at m/z = 1223.6/8
(1222.3), which represents the m/z of a 4mer nucleotide of the 5′ end. Taken together, these
results confirm that the modified structure is a methylated adenine
and it is at the ninth position of the proposed oligonucleotide from
the 5′to 3′ direction.

The chromatographic and
mass spectral evidence presented above
indicates that the product oligonucleotide could have the MW expected
for a 16mer containing the m1A adduct in the correct position. We
then tested the repair of this product by the AlkB protein, which
is an enzyme that repairs various alkylated DNA adducts (Figure 1b).32,34 The result showed the repair efficiency of this oligonucleotide
by AlkB was very low, even when 2.5 μM of AlkB was incubated
with the 5.0 μM product oligonucleotide (Figures 6b and S24). This
observation was in contrast to the report that m1A is a good substrate
of AlkB (e.g. 0.2 μM of AlkB is able to repair 5.0 μM
m1A completely in 1 h).10 We suspected
that the structure in the product oligonucleotide may not be m1A,
even though it had a MW identical to m1A. The reverse-phase HPLC results
also showed an anomalous phenomenon. For example, the positively charged
m1A nucleobase34 should be more polar than
the natural base adenine and thus have a shorter retention time on
a C18 column. However, the opposite was observed: adenine has a shorter
retention time than the product (Figure 2a,c).

Figure 6 HPLC profiles of the AlkB repair reactions
on different alkyl substrates.
The three chromatograms within each panel represent one set of repair
reaction including the oligonucleotides of starting material, reaction
mixture, and product. For example, in the panel containing chromatograms
a–c, (a) represents the starting material m6A, (b) represents
the repair reaction of m6A by AlkB, and (c) represents the pure product
adenine synthesized separately. Chromatograms shown in a–c
relevant to m6A repair and in j–l relevant to m3U repair were
analyzed under reverse-phase conditions. Chromatograms shown in d–f
relevant to m1A repair and in g–i relevant to m3C repair were
analyzed under anion-exchange conditions (see the Experimental Section for detailed information). (a) m6A; (b)
m6A + AlkB; (c) A; (d) m1A; (e) m1A + AlkB; (f) A; (g) m3C; (h) m3C
+ AlkB; (i) C; (j) m3U; (k) m3U + AlkB; and (l) U.

It has been reported that 6-methyladenine (m6A)
could be generated
from a Dimroth rearrangement of m1A under basic conditions (Figure 1a and Table 1).34,45 We therefore conducted a new batch synthesis of m1A under a milder
deprotection condition (25 °C for 16 h). The product oligonucleotide
was eluted as a single peak in both HPLC columns (Figure 2b for C18 and Figure 6d for anion-exchange). The
HPLC retention time in reverse-phase HPLC exhibited a shorter retention
time (8.5 min, Figure 2b) than the unmodified control adenine (9.0 min, Figure 2c) or the previous product
(10.2 min, m6A, Figure 2a), which is in good agreement with the theory that m1A should be
more polar than both A and m6A.

The MW of the new product was
characterized by HR-MS and had the
correct m/z of m1A at 1224.715 (1224.711)
(Figures 3b and S2 and Table 1). The MS/MS results (e.g., the w7, w8, a9-X, and a10-G ions, Figures 4, S6, S11, and S12, and Table S2) demonstrated
that the modification is at the ninth position from the 5′
end and it is a methylated adenine. The exonuclease digestion with
MALDI-TOF analyses (Figures S18 and S21a) also confirmed the location and identity of the adduct. For example,
the 2746.1 (before the adduct) and 2418.8 (after the adduct) peaks
at 3 min digestion in Figure S18 were present.
Finally, incubation with AlkB showed an excellent repair efficiency
against the new product oligonucleotide: 5.0 μM adduct was mostly
repaired in 1 h with the 0.2 μM enzyme (Figure 6e).10 Taken together,
these results confirmed the newly synthesized product as a 16mer oligonucleotide
containing m1A at the ninth position from the 5′ end (Figure 1a).

Identification
of the m3U Byproduct from m3C Synthesis
We also wanted to
synthesize an oligonucleotide containing m3C as
the substrate for the AlkB family DNA repair reactions within the
same sequence context as for the m1A oligonucleotide (Figure 1a).34,39 After automated synthesis and standard deprotection (80 °C
for 3 h), the HPLC chromatogram from a C18 column showed two peaks
with similar intensities (9.5 and 11.6 min, Figure 2d), which were readily separated (Figure 2e,f). HR-MS analysis
showed that the early eluting peak (9.5 min, Figure 2e) had an m/z value of 1218.703 at its −4 charge state (Figures 3c and S3), which is in agreement with that of the m/z of the target m3C-containing oligonucleotide
(theoretical m/z 1218.709, Table 1). The second species
at 11.6 min (Figure 2f) showed an m/z of 1218.957 at
its −4 charge state (Figures 3d and S4). Compared to the
9.5 min peak, the m/z value of the
second species was 0.254 unit higher at the −4 charge state,
indicating that the MW (4879.850 Da) of the second species is 1.016
Da higher than the first one. This is consistent with the m/z value of an oligonucleotide containing
3-methyluricil (m3U) at its −4 charge state (1218.955, Table 1). m3U could potentially
be generated from deamination of m3C under basic conditions (Figure 1a).46 The MS/MS results of the two oligonucleotides (e.g., the
w7, w8, a9-X, and a10-G
ions, Figures 4, S7, S8, and S13 to S16, Tables S3, and S4) demonstrated that the modifications are at the
ninth position from the 5′ end. The exonuclease digestion with
MALDI-TOF analyses (Figures S19, S20, and S21b) also confirmed the location and identity of the adducts. At 7 min
digestion, signature peaks were 2722.2 (before the adduct) and 2418.8
(after the adduct) for m3C (Figure S19);
and 2723.3 (before the adduct) and 2418.7 (after the adduct) for m3U
(Figure S20). The C18 HPLC retention time
of the two species showed an m3C-containing oligonucleotide had a
shorter retention time (9.5 min, Figure 2e) than m3U (11.6 min, Figure 2f). This result indicated that m3C is more
polar than m3U, which supports that m3C is positively charged at pH
7.0 (Figure 1a).34 The AlkB reaction (0.2 μM) on the m3C-containing
oligonucleotide showed a good repair efficiency: 5.0 μM m3C
adduct was mostly repaired to cytosine after 1 h (Figure 6h). This was not the case for
m3U-containing oligonucleotides under a similar condition, which showed
almost no repair to m3U (Figure 6k). These observations were consistent with the observations
that m3C is a strong substrate but m3U is a weak substrate for AlkB
under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.34,47

To avoid the formation of m3U, we carried out a second batch
synthesis of m3C-containing oligonucleotides under a milder deprotection
condition (25 °C for 16 h). This time we observed only the m3C-containing
species in the HPLC chromatogram (similar to Figure 2e). The identity of the newly synthesized
m3C was confirmed by the aforementioned spectroscopic and enzymatic
tests. These results indicate that the formation of the byproduct
m3U was from deamination of m3C catalyzed by harsh deprotection conditions
(high temperature and alkaline).46,47 Serendipitously,
the formation of m3U/m6A in the first batch of synthesis (80 °C
for 3 h) provides a new method for chemically preparing m3U/m6A-containing
oligonucleotides.

Discussion
For the synthesis of
m1A, we observed a byproduct m6A, which exhibited
identical MW and location to m1A. It is difficult to differentiate
m1A and m6A without conducting bioassays and careful HPLC retention
analysis. As for m3C, it was the m3U byproduct that showed a 1 Da
difference in the ∼4900 Da context (Table 1). The two oligonucleotides could be eluted
as a single species in HPLC under certain conditions; thus, it is
imperative to perform HR-MS analysis and enzymatic reaction to distinguish
the two products. For HPLC analysis of modified oligonucleotides,
we used a combination of two different separation systems, such as
reverse-phase (e.g. C18) and anion-exchange chromatography. For example,
it is not easy to find a suitable condition for fully separating 16mer-containing
m1A and A with C18 columns (Figure 2b,c). However, it is relatively easy to separate them
with an anion-exchange column because m1A is positively charged at
neutral pH but A is not (Figures 1a, 6d and 6f).34 On the other hand, it is not easy
to distinguish m6A and A under anion-exchange conditions (Figures S22 and S23) because of their neutrality
at pH 7.0, but it is possible to separate them on the C18 column (Figure 2a,c).

The MW
of the oligonucleotide can be determined by HR-MS, and the
location of the modification can be identified by MS/MS or exonuclease
digestion with MALDI-TOF analysis. To further confirm the identity
of the oligonucleotide from a biological activity perspective, we
recommend running enzymatic reaction on the product. In this work,
we used SVP exonuclease to digest all oligonucleotides formed in the
syntheses. A specific enzyme for certain types of modification could
greatly help elucidate the structure of modification. Therefore, we
tested the repair efficiency of m1A and m3C and their byproducts by
the AlkB repair enzyme.32,34 The AlkB protein in Escherichia coli is an α-ketoglutarate/Fe(II)-dependent
dioxygenase that repairs various alkyl DNA adducts, including m1A
and m3C (Figure 1).30−32,39,48−50 We found that m1A and m3C are good substrates but
m6A and m3U are weak substrates of AlkB.34,47,48 For other modified structures, it is highly
recommended that a biological or enzymatic assay should be adopted
for identifying the product. The reason for adopting an enzymatic
test is because a byproduct (e.g. m6A) may have an MW identical to
the target product (e.g. m1A), which may be hard to differentiate
by LC and MS analyses, including the MS/MS and exonuclease digestion
with MALDI-TOF analysis.

Conclusion
Chemical synthesis of
oligonucleotides is important for conducting
various biological, chemical, and medical research including oligonucleotide
drug development. The field of oligonucleotide synthesis has progressed
such that DNA and RNA containing standard bases can be ordered from
commercial sources. Most of these oligonucleotides are in high quality,
but it is a good practice to perform quality control to confirm that
the products have the correct sequences in high purity. A simple HPLC/MS
analysis should be sufficient for most applications. However, a more
rigorous and stringent quality control procedure51−53 should be adopted
for site-specifically modified oligonucleotides, such as epigenetic
marks, DNA adducts, and drug candidates. In some cases, byproducts
are generated from side chemical reactions during standard automated
synthesis and deprotection steps. For this reason, specific deprotection
conditions may be required for preparation of oligonucleotide-containing
modifications, such as epigenetic biomarkers 5-hydroxymethyl-dC, 5-formyl-dC,
and 5-carboxy-dC.54,55 After synthesis and deprotection,
it is even more important to carry out a thorough purification and
characterization procedure to ensure (1) complete removal of protecting
groups, (2) product having high purity, and (3) modification having
the correct position and identity. In this study, we used a reliable
and robust procedure to characterize byproducts from m1A and m3C syntheses.
The protocol used here could be helpful for identifying byproducts
generated from other oligonucleotide syntheses.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of Oligonucleotides Containing m1A and m3C
Oligonucleotides
(16mer) with the sequence 5′-GAAGACCTXGGCGTCC-3′
containing the lesions at the X position were made by using solid-phase
phosphoramidite chemistry on a MerMade-4 Oligonucleotide synthesizer.10,34,56 The phosphoramidites were purchased
from ChemGenes. N1-Methyl deoxyadenosine
(n-fmoc) phosphoramidite was used for m1A synthesis. N3-Methyl deoxycytidine (n-bz) phosphoramidite was used
for m3C synthesis. The final cleavage and deprotection step was usually
carried out by treating the oligonucleotide with concentrated aqueous
ammonium hydroxide (28%) at 80 °C for 3 h. The modified cleavage
and deprotection step for minimizing the byproduct formation was at
25 °C for 16 h. The concentration of an oligonucleotide was determined
by measuring UV absorbance at 260 nm. The extinction coefficient (ε)
of a certain adduct is calculated as its unmodified counterpart because
of the negligible variation between the values in the context of a
16mer DNA.

Purity Test of Oligonucleotides Containing
m1A and m3C and Related
Byproducts by HPLC
The purity of oligonucleotides was tested
by both reverse-phase (C18) and anion-exchange HPLC methods. For the
reverse-phase test, liquid chromatographic separation was performed
by using a Phenomenex Luna Semi-Preparative C18 column (9 × 250
mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Solvent A was 100 mM triethylammonium
acetate in water, and solvent B was 100% acetonitrile. A solvent gradient
was carried out under the following conditions: 2.0% of B for 0.2
min, 2.0 to 9.0% of B over 0.3 min, 9.0 to 9.4% of B over 16 min,
9.4 to 70.0% of B over 0.5 min, 70.0% of B for 3 min, 70.0 to 2.0%
of B over 0.5 min, and 2.0% B over 4.5 min. The column oven was set
at 40 °C. The UV signal at 260 nm was used to detect the oligonucleotide
absorbance. For the anion-exchange LC analysis, oligonucleotides were
purified and tested by using a Thermo DNAPac PA-100 anion-exchange
column (4 × 250 mm, 13 μm) with solvent A as water and
solvent B as 1.5 M ammonium acetate in water. A solvent gradient was
carried out under the following conditions: 50.0% of B for 1 min,
50.0 to 52.0% of B over 2 min, 52.0 to 75.0% over 1 min, 75.0% of
B for 2 min, 75.0 to 50.0% of B over 0.5 min, and 50.0% of B for 4.5
min. The flow rate was at 4.0 mL/min.

HPLC/MS Analysis
HR-MS analyses of oligonucleotides
were performed on AB Sciex triple quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometers
(ABI4600 and ABI5600). ESI was conducted by using a needle voltage
of 4.0 kV in a negative ion mode. A heated capillary was set at 600
°C. The nebulizer gas pressure was 40 psi; the heater gas pressure
was 40 psi; the curtain gas pressure was 25 psi; the declustering
potential was −220 V; and the collision energy was −10
V. Liquid chromatographic separation was performed using a Phenomenex
Luna C18 column (4.6 × 100 mm; 5 μm) at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/min. Solvent A was 10 mM ammonium acetate in water, and solvent
B was 100% acetonitrile. A solvent gradient was carried out under
the following conditions: 2.0% of B for 0.5 min, 2.0 to 17.4% of B
over 11 min, 17.4 to 60.0% of B over 0.1 min, 60.0% of B for 2 min,
60.0 to 2.0% of B over 0.1 min, and 2.0% B over 3.3 min.

MS/MS Analysis
Oligonucleotide fragmentation analyses
were performed by manually injecting the oligonucleotide samples of
100 pmol/μL into AB Sciex triple quadrupole-TOF mass spectrometers
(ABI4600 and ABI5600). The syringe flow rate was set at 10 μL/min.
ESI was conducted by using a needle voltage of 4.5 kV in a negative
ion mode. A heated capillary was set at 400 °C. The nebulizer
gas pressure was 75 psi; the heater gas pressure was 25 psi; the curtain
gas pressure was 25 psi; the declustering potential was −100
V; and the collision energy was −15 V. The parent ion m/z for m6A, m1A, m3C, and m3U were selected
as 816.14 (−6 charge), 816.14 (−6 charge), 974.77 (−5
charge), and 974.96 (−5 charge), respectively. Data analyses
were performed with the AB Sciex Analyst TF software 1.7.

Exonuclease
Digestion with MALDI-TOF Analysis
The modified
oligonucleotides were characterized by 3′–5′exonuclease
digestion followed by MALDI-TOF analysis. In general, 1.0 μL
of sample containing 200–250 pmol of a modified oligonucleotide
was used for digestion. SVP (0.2 unit) was added together with 6.0
μL of ammonium citrate (100 mM, pH 9.4) and 6.0 μL of
water for the 3′ to 5′ digestion.11 For the MALDI-TOF analyses, 1.0 μL of the mixture
was used at a certain time point until the digestion was almost finished;
the digestion was quenched by mixing with 1.0 μL of the MALDI
analysis matrix (3-hydroxypicolinic acid and diammonium hydrogen citrate
in a 1:1 ratio). Samples were analyzed by a Shimadzu Axima Performance
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer using a 50 Hz laser with a power setting
of 90 in a positive ion reflection mode with 500 shots collected.13

Enzymatic Reaction with the AlkB Protein
and HPLC Analysis
All reactions were performed at 37 °C
for 1 h in a reaction
buffer containing 70.0 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O, 0.93 mM α-ketoglutarate,
1.86 mM ascorbic acid, and 46.5 mM HEPES (pH 8.0).10 The reactions were quenched by adding 10.0 mM EDTA followed
by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Typically, 0.25 μM of the
purified AlkB protein was incubated with 5.0 μM m6A and m1A
in the presence of all cofactors in a 20 μL reaction volume.
For m3C and m3U, 0.18 μM of AlkB was incubated with 5.0 μM
of oligonucleotides. Samples were then analyzed under an HPLC condition
that was able to separate the substrate and the product.

To
separate the starting material and the product of the enzymatic reactions
for the four lesions, different HPLC conditions were optimized by
using either C18 or anion-exchange columns. The UV detection was set
at 260 nm. Specifically, (1) m6A and its repaired product A were analyzed
by using a Phenomenex Luna Semi-Preparative C18 column (10 ×
150 mm, 5 μm) under the following conditions: solvent A was
100 mM triethylammonium acetate in water, and solvent B was 100% acetonitrile.
A solvent gradient was carried out under the following conditions:
2.0% of B for 0.2 min, 2.0 to 9.0% of B over 0.3 min, 9.0 to 9.4%
of B over 16 min, 9.4 to 70.0% of B over 0.5 min, 70.0% of B for 3
min, 70.0 to 2.0% of B over 0.5 min, and 2.0% B for 4.5 min. The flow
rate was at 3.0 mL/min. The column oven was set at 40 °C. This
protocol was also used to analyze m3U and its repair product U. (2)
m1A and its repaired product A were analyzed by using a Thermo DNAPac
PA-100 anion-exchange column (4 × 250 mm, 13 μm) with solvent
A as water and solvent B as 1.5 M ammonium acetate in water. A solvent
gradient was carried out under the following conditions: 50.0% of
B for 1 min, 50.0 to 52.0% of B over 2 min, 52.0 to 75.0% over 1 min,
75.0% of B for 2 min, 75.0 to 50.0% of B over 0.5 min, and 50.0% of
B for 4.5 min. The flow rate was at 4.0 mL/min. (3) m3C and its repaired
product C were analyzed with a similar protocol to m1A/A analysis,
except that the solvent gradient was changed to the following conditions:
50.0% of B for 1 min, 50.0 to 57.0% of B over 1 min, 57.0% of B for
2 min, 57.0 to 50.0% of B for 0.5 min, and then 50.0% of B for 4.5
min.
