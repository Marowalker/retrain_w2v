We have investigated the structural stabilities and electronic
properties for AA and the Bernal-stacked AB bilayer zigzag graphene
nanoribbons (ZZGNRs) using first-principles calculations within density
functional theory. The AB-stacked ZZGNR exhibits the spin-polarized
state, while the AA-stacked ZZGNR has the nonmagnetic ground state,
being more energetically stable than the AB-stacked one. For the AA-stacked
ZZGNR, the interaction between the so-called edge states rather than
the van der Waals (vdW) interaction plays an important role: the occupied
up-spin and the unoccupied down-spin states at one end of ZZGNR interact
with each other, and vice versa at the other end, forming the non-spin-polarized
bonding and antibonding states at the zigzag edge. Thus, the structural
stability for the AA-stacked ZZGNR is dominated by the trade-off between
the edge–edge interaction and the vdW interaction of the basal
plane of GNRs.

Introduction
Graphene, a two-dimensional (2D) sheet
of sp2-bonded
carbon atoms in a honeycomb arrangement, has attracted enormous attention1 because of its extraordinary electronic2,3 and thermal4−6 properties. However, graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor,
and thus, many attempts have been made to modulate the electronic
properties with an external electric field7−10 and heteroatoms11−13 for future applications in carbon-based nanoelectronic devices.

Dimension reduction, a fabrication of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs),
has also been thought as one of the methods for the modulation of
electronic properties of graphene. While in recent years, GNRs have
been realized experimentally,14−20 over the past few decades, a considerable number of theoretical
studies have been made on the remarkable structural and electronic
properties of GNRs.21−23 GNRs have two basic shapes with armchair and zigzag
edges. It has been well known that the electronic properties of GNRs
depend strongly on edge shapes. Armchair graphene nanoribbons can
be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their widths.24,25 On the other hand, for zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZZGNRs), there
does not exist a distinct bandgap, and two degenerate flat bands (FBs)
appear just at the Fermi level (EF) within
the tight-binding approximation.24,26 However, ab
initio calculations have shown that ZZGNRs have spin-polarized, antiferromagnetic
ground states and that especially a narrow ZZGNR has a finite bandgap.27 Therefore, ZZGNRs are expected to be magnetic
materials28−30 and materials for spintronic devices.31,32 Such peculiar electronic structures are attributed to the localized
state near the zigzag edge, the so-called edge state consisting of
nonbonding pz orbitals.24−34

Recently, the successful fabrication of van der Waals (vdW)
heterostructures
has opened new ways for band-structure engineering.35−37 Very recently,
it has been reported that even homostructures like bi- and few-layer
graphenes possess peculiar electronic structures38−40 such as superconductors.41 Furthermore, research studies regarding the
interaction between edges as well as interplanar interaction have
also been conducted for GNRs, one-dimensional (1D) architectures of
graphene. For ZZGNRs having the spin-polarized edge state, the presence
of a peculiar stacking structure has been confirmed: two possible
stacking fashions, AA and AB stackings, whereas graphite or bilayer
graphene has the Bernal stacking.42 AB-stacked
bilayer ZZGNRs are further classified into two types, ABα and ABβ,38 depending
on the relative position of their edges, as shown in Figure 1a,b. From the viewpoint of
energetics, the AA- and the ABα-stacked ZZGNRs are
more stable than the ABβ-stacked one.43 The AA- and ABα-stacked ZZGNRs
have the nonmagnetic ground states,43,44 while for
the ABβ-stacked ZZGNRs, the antiferromagnetic ground
state remains unchanged in each constituent layer.43 It has been shown by density functional theory (DFT) and
tight-binding calculations that the ABα- and the
AA-stacked ZZGNRs become semiconductiong43,45,46 and metallic,47,48 respectively.
It is noted that AA- and ABα-stacked ZZGNRs have
the characteristic structures: the interlayer distance at the edge
is quite shorter than that in the central region, whereas the ABβ-stacked one maintains a planar structure, indicating
the presence of some edge–edge interaction for the AA- and
ABα-stacked ZZGNRs.49,50 This means
that the structural stability of bilayer ZZGNRs is dominated by not
only the vdW interaction in central region but also the edge–edge
interaction at the edge.

Figure 1 Initial structures for (a) ABα, (b) ABβ, and (c) optimized structure for ABα, that is,
the AA′-stacked bilayer ZZGNRs with the ribbon width, N = 6. The white and brown balls indicate H and C atoms,
respectively.

However, it has not been clarified how the edge–edge
interaction
is associated with the disappearance of magnetism. In this work, we
have investigated the structural and electronic properties of bilayer
ZZGNRs and have revealed the stabilization mechanism of the nonmagnetized
bilayer stacked ZZGNRs using first-principles DFT calculations in
view of the direct interaction between the spin-polarized states at
the edges.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1c shows
the optimized structure of bilayer ZZGNRs for the initial structure
of ABα with the ribbon width, N =
6. This structure has no longer the Bernal stacking, rather an AA-derived
one, as described later. On the other hand, the ABβ-stacked ZZGNR maintained the Bernal stacking even after structural
optimization. Thus, we hereafter refer to the optimized structures
for ABα and ABβ as AA′ and
AB, respectively.

Figure 2 shows EC for bilayer ZZGNRs as
a function of the ribbon
width, N. The values of EC calculated for the bilayer graphenes with the AA (−26.2 meV)
and AB (−29.9 meV) stackings are also shown by horizontal dashed
lines. The AB-stacked ZZGNR decreases with increasing ribbon width
and approaches that for the bilayer AB graphene monotonically, because
the effective number of carbon atoms involved in the interlayer vdW
interaction increases with increasing N. On the other
hand, it can be seen that the values of EC for the AA- and the AA′-stacked ZZGNRs take minimum values.
Such peculiar behavior in EC is attributed
not only to the vdW but also to the edge–edge interaction.

The circles, stars, and triangles represent AA, AA′, and AB
stackings, respectively. The dashed horizontal red and blue lines
indicate the values of EC for bilayer
AA and AB graphenes, respectively.

It has been well known that the monolayer ZZGNR
has the so-called
edge state localized near the edge. To reveal the stabilization mechanism
of the AA and the AA′ stackings, we revisit the electronic
structure of monolayer ZZGNRs with a width of N =
6 as an example. It has been shown that the antiferromagnetic ground
state is more stable than the nonmagnetic and the ferromagnetic states
by 61 meV and 53 meV per unit cell, respectively, which agrees well
with the previous theoretical results.29Figure 3a,b shows
the band structures of the nonmagnetic and the antiferromagnetic monolayer
ZZGNRs, respectively. For the nonmagnetic monolayer ZZGNR, the degenerate
flat bands lie just at the EF in the vicinity
of the X point. These flat band states which are degenerate at EF can gain the exchange interaction energy,
resulting in the lifting and the splitting into two bands above and
below EF near the X point (ΔEFBGNR). As a result, the ground state becomes antiferromagnetic. The spatial
distribution of the spin densities, Δρ(r)
= ρup(r) – ρdown(r), are shown in Figure 4a for the antiferromagnetic ground state of the monolayer
ZZGNR with N = 6. As clearly shown in this figure,
one sublattice sites are occupied by up-spin electrons and the other
ones are occupied by down-spin ones. These states consist of the pz orbital of carbon atoms and localized near
the zigzag edge.

ZZGNRs, and (e) nonmagnetic AA- and (f) nonmagnetic AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs with the ribbon width of N = 6. Red and blue
lines indicate up- and down-spin states, respectively. The dashed
line indicates the Fermi level, EF. ΔE represents the energy difference between the occupied
and the unoccupied flat bands (FB) at the X point.

and (c) inter-antiferromagnetic AB-stacked ZZGNRs, and (d) AA- and
(e) AA′-stacked ZZGNRs with the ribbon width of N = 6. The white and brown balls indicate H and C atoms, respectively.
Yellow and blue colors correspond to the positive and negative values
of Δρ(r).

Figure 4b,c shows
the optimized atomic structures and spin-density distributions of
AB-stacked ZZGNRs (N = 6). We can confirm the two
types of magnetic arrangements between the layers, ferromagnetic (Figure 4b) and antiferromagnetic
(Figure 4c). The energy
difference between these states is negligibly small (∼3 meV
per unit cell); there is no magnetic interaction between the layers.
The interlayer distance is 3.50 Å, which is slightly larger than
that of bilayer AB graphene (3.47 Å). Figure 3c,d shows the band structures for the AB-stacked
ZZGNRs with interferromagnetic and inter-antiferromagnetic interactions
between the layers. As clearly seen in these figures, the degeneracy
of flat bands is lifted because of the two types of edges, inward
and outward edges. On the other hand, the AA- and AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs have peculiar structural and electronic properties. Figure 4d,e shows the optimized
atomic structures of the AA- and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs, respectively.
Interestingly, these ZZGNRs no longer maintain planar structures unlike
the AB-stacked one: the interlayer distance at the edge becomes shorter
than that at the center of GNRs and is also quite shorter than those
of bilayer graphene and AB-stacked ZZGNRs. This means that the edge
carbon atoms between the layers strongly interact with each other.
It is noted that the edge-localized state characteristic of ZZGNRs
disappears and thus the nonmagnetic state becomes the ground state.
The magnetic ground state for bilayer ZZGNRs with each stacking remains
unchanged regardless of the ribbon width. Figure 3e,f shows the band structures of the AA-
and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs, respectively. It can be seen in these
figures that two degenerate flat bands are maintained below and above EF in the vicinity of the Brillouin zone (BZ)
boundary just like the antiferromagnetic monolayer and the AB-stacked
ZZGNRs, indicated by “FB1” and “FB2” in Figure 3e,f. In addition,
for the AA-stacked ZZGNRs, two metallic bands pass across EF and are accidentally degenerate just at EF like the so-called Dirac point, indicated
by “MB” in Figure 3e. For the AA′-stacked ZZGNRs, the band structure
is similar to those of the AA-stacked ones except for the metallic
band, where a slight bandgap appears, which is caused by the asymmetric
edge states.

To explore the origin of such singular electronic
structures, we
investigate into the probability densities of the wave functions for
FB1 and FB2. Figure 5a,b shows the probability densities of the flat bands for the AA-
and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs at the X point, respectively. We can
see that the FB1(X) and FB2(X) states consist of the pz orbitals localized at the edge carbon atoms. For
FB2(X), pz orbitals overlap each other
at the interlayer region, while a nodal plane exists between the layers
for FB1(X). The most likely explanation is that pseudochemical bonds
comprised of the edge-localized pz orbitals
are formed, leading to the bonding and the antibonding states between
GNRs. Figure 5c shows
the schematic of interlayer interaction between edge states. The occupied
up-spin and the unoccupied down-spin states at one end of GNRs are
eligible to interact with each other, and vice versa at the other
end of the GNRs, resulting in the non-spin-polarized bonding and antibonding
orbitals. The existence of the pseudochemical interaction between
the edge states is supported by the following fact: the energy differences
between the occupied and unoccupied flat bands, 1.23 and 1.06 eV at
the X point for the AA- and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs, respectively,
become large compared to that for the monolayer ZZGNR, 0.73 eV. The
decrease in the interlayer distance at the edge for the AA- and AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs also corroborates the formation of pseudocovalent bondings
between the edge-localized pz orbitals.
It must be noted that the resonance energy between the pz orbitals at the edge is not so large compared with
a value for a typical covalent bonding. Indeed, the stacking energies
for the AA- and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs (N = 6)
are merely lower than that for the AB-stacked one by 0.109 and 0.116
eV per unit cell, respectively.

Figure 5 Probability densities for wave functions
of FB1 and FB2 at the
X points, indicated in the band structures of (a) the AA- and (b)
AA′-stacked ZZGNRs. The light-green shadowed area indicates
the isosurface of probability densities. (c) Schematic of the interaction
between spin-polarized pz orbitals for
the AA-stacked ZZGNRs.

We are now ready to consider the difference in
the EC profile: a minimum EC exists
for the AA- or AA′-stacked ZZGNRs, while EC decreases monotonously as a function of the ribbon width N for the AB-stacked ones. For the AA- or AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs, the value of EC is determined
not only by the vdW interaction but also by the edge–edge interaction.
Since the edge states at opposite edges are weakened mutually for
a narrower ZZGNR, the amplitude of the edge state progresses with
increasing N. Therefore, the edge–edge interaction
becomes large and then EC lowers with N. On the other hand, the EC value of the AA- or AA′-stacked ZZGNRs increases and approaches
that of bilayer graphene, because the relative contribution of the
edge–edge interaction with respect to the total interaction
between GNRs decreases with increasing N. Viewed
in this light, the stabilities of the AA- and AA′-stacked ZZGNRs
are dominated by the trade-off between the vdW interaction of the
basal plane of GNRs and the edge–edge interaction attributed
to the edge-localized states. This is the reason why the EC profile have minimum values for the AA- and AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs.

Conclusions
The structural stabilities and electronic
properties of AA-, AA′-,
and AB-stacked bilayer ZZGNRs have been investigated. For AB-stacked
ZZGNRs, each constituent layer maintains the planar structure and
exhibits the spin-polarized state, that is, antiferromagnetic state
as with the monolayer. On the other hand, for AA- and AA′-stacked
ZZGNRs, the interlayer distance at the edge becomes shorter than that
in the central region and the nonmagnetic state becomes the ground
state. Such changes in the structure and the magnetic ground state
are attributed to the pseudochemical bondings between the edge-localized
pz orbitals: the occupied up-spin and
the unoccupied down-spin states at one side of GNRs interact directly
with each other, and vice versa at the other side. The resonance energy
between the pz orbitals is not so large
compared with a value for a typical covalent bond; thus, the trade-off
between the edge–edge interaction and the vdW interaction of
the basal plane of GNRs dominates the structural stabilities for the
AA- and the AA′-stacked ZZGNRs. Various terminal functional
groups can be available as joining couplers between layers. Our insights
will open up a new paradigm in the edge-engineered stacking of 2D
materials.

Computational Methods
We investigated the structural
stability of bilayer ZZGNRs with
AA, AA′, and AB stackings (see Figure 1), which have widths of N zigzag chains (N = 2–12) of carbon atoms.
Edges of each GNR were terminated by hydrogen atoms. We employed the
lattice constant optimized for graphene (2.472 Å) as a unit cell
length along the ribbon axis. To avoid interaction between adjacent
GNRs in a supercell geometry, GNRs were separated by 15 Å along
the other axes. The structural stability of the bilayer system was
evaluated on the basis of the stacking energy, EC 1  where EBL and EML are the total energies for the bilayer and
monolayer systems, respectively. nC is
the number of carbon atoms per unit cell.

We employed the first-principles
calculations based on DFT using
the Vienna ab initio simulation package51 code with the nonlocal vdW correction.52 The opt-PBE scheme developed by Klimeš et al.53 was adopted as the exchange and correlation
energy functional. The cutoff energy of plane wave expansion was taken
to be 550 eV. Integration over the 1D (2D) BZ was carried out using
84 k (24 × 24 k) point sampling for ZZGNRs (graphenes). For all
models, structural optimization was performed until each component
of the interatomic force became less than 5.0 × 10–3 eV/Å.
