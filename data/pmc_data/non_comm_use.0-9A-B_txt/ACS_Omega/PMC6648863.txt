The resource utilization of waste plastic
can not only control environmental pollution but can also ease up
the problems of lack of energy resources. In this study, molybdenum
carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles have been synthesized by utilizing
waste polyvinyl chloride as a carbon source in a stainless-steel autoclave
at 600 °C. X-ray diffraction pattern indicates that the product
is orthorhombic phase Mo2C. Electron microscopy photographs
show that the obtained Mo2C product consisted of crystalline
nanoparticles with an average size of 50 nm. The possible formation
mechanisms of Mo2C have been also briefly discussed on
the basis of the structures of the products synthesized with different
reaction times. The effects of reaction temperature on the crystallinity
and microstructure of the obtained products have been investigated.
The results show that higher reaction temperature promotes the formation
of Mo2C with high crystallinity.

1 Introduction
Molybdenum carbide is an important ceramic
material because of its unique properties, such as high melting point
(2770 K), extreme hardness, and high chemical stability.1−4 Moreover,
molybdenum carbide exhibits excellent catalytic properties on ammonia
synthesis, H2 production, and alcohol synthesis.5

Up to now, several methods have been developed
to synthesize molybdenum carbides, such as direct pyrolysis of molybdenum
hexacarbonyl,6 molten salt method,7 electrochemical method,8 solution route,9 carbothermal reduction
of molybdenum oxide with carbon at high temperature,10,11 chemical vapor deposition (CVD),12−14 solid-state metathesis,15 thermal reduction of molybdenum chloride and carbon (graphite or
carbon nanotube) with metallic sodium,16 and co-reduction of carbon tetrabromide and molybdenum pentachloride
with metallic sodium in benzene.17 Mo2C nanoparticle-decorated graphitic carbon sheets have been
synthesized via a solid-state reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and sodium alginate
under Ar at 900 °C.18 Recently, Geng
and co-workers have synthesized Mo2C/graphene heterostructures
by molten copper-catalyzed CVD.19

Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) materials have been widely used in the daily
life because of their excellent properties such as transparence, chemical
stability, and low density.20 However,
the waste PVC in the environment generates a toxic compound dioxin
which is very harmful to humans and animals.21 Developing an effective method of waste PVC disposal can help to
reduce the dioxin emissions, which is good for environment protection.
Up to now, many treatment methods for waste plastic have been reported.22−35 Zhang and his co-workers have synthesized carbon-based
materials by utilizing waste plastic as a carbon source.28−33 We have developed
a method to synthesize silicon carbide and transition-metal carbides
from waste plastic.34−36 In
this study, we have reported a facile method for synthesizing Mo2C nanoparticles through the reactions between metallic sodium,
molybdenum sulfide, and waste PVC at relatively low temperature. This
work is aimed not only to develop a simple method to synthesize molybdenum
carbide but also to explore an effective method of waste PVC disposal.

2 Results and Discussion
The crystal structures of the obtained products are investigated
by X-ray diffraction (XRD). A typical XRD pattern of the obtained
product via our designed route is shown in Figure 1. All the peaks in the Figure 1 can be indexed to orthorhombic phase molybdenum
carbide (Mo2C). The calculated lattice parameters a = 4.7311 Å, b = 6.0258 Å, and c = 5.2105 Å are almost consistent with the reported
data (JCPDS no. 79-0744, a = 4.7350 Å, b = 6.0250 Å, and c = 5.2100 Å).
No other diffraction peaks of byproducts such as MoS2 and
metallic Mo are found in the XRD pattern, which indicates that the
conversion of waste PVC to molybdenum carbide has been completed via
our designed route.

Figure 1 XRD pattern of the obtained Mo2C product.

The field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained
Mo2C product are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. It can be seen that the
Mo2C nanoparticles are agglomerated in the obtained product.
The average size of Mo2C nanoparticles is about 50 nm.
A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the obtained Mo2C product is presented in Figure 2c. The neighbor lattice interplanar spacing is about
0.24 nm, which is very close to the distance between two (200) planes
in orthorhombic phase Mo2C. A typical energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrum is shown in Figure 2d, which displays that the obtained product
consists of Mo and C.

Figure 2 (a) FESEM image,
(b) TEM image, (c) HRTEM image, and (d) EDX of the obtained Mo2C product.

Magnetization on the obtained Mo2C product is investigated with a superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID) at 10 Oe. Zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling
(FC) temperature dependencies of magnetization M for
the obtained Mo2C product are present in Figure 3. From Figure 3, the diamagnetism has been observed under
the ZFC and FC conditions. The onset of the strong Meissner effect
at about 9.80 K has been observed, which indicates the existence of
superconductivity in the Mo2C product. The observation
is almost consistent with the results of the previous reported work.37

of magnetization for
the obtained Mo2C product.

The effect of reaction time on the formation
of Mo2C nanoparticles has been investigated. Figure 4a shows the XRD pattern of
the product obtained from the reaction of molybdenum sulfide, metallic
sodium, and waste PVC at 600 °C for 10 min. The diffraction peaks
labeled as “●”in Figure 4a can be indexed as hexagonal phase MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 87-2416), and the other three diffraction
peaks labeled as “▼” can be indexed as cubic
metallic molybdenum (JCPDS card no. 89-4896). From the XRD result,
we found that the product (obtained from the reaction for 10 min)
is the mixture of MoS2 and metallic molybdenum, which proves
that part of the raw material (MoS2) has been reduced to
metallic molybdenum by metallic sodium. The reaction of reducing MoS2 can be expressed as eq 1 1  

Figure 4 Typical XRD
patterns
of the products obtained at 600 °C with different reaction times:
(a) 10 min, (b) 30 min, (c) 60 min, and (d) 5 h.

According to the calculations of free energy, the reaction 1 at 600 °C is highly exothermic (ΔrHm = −454.3 kJ/mol) and
thermodynamically spontaneous (ΔrGm = −384.5 kJ/mol). Meanwhile, waste PVC could
be reduced by metallic sodium to activated carbon, which can be expressed
as follows 2  

The diffraction peaks of carbon cannot be detected
in the XRD pattern (Figure 4a), probably because the carbon is amorphous. Because of the
poor thermal stability of PVC, the waste PVC has been reduced to produce
carbon in this process.

Figure 4b,c shows the XRD patterns of the products obtained
from the reaction of molybdenum sulfide, metallic sodium, and waste
PVC at 600 °C for 30 and 60 min. The three diffraction peaks
labeled as “▼” in Figure 4b,c can be indexed as cubic metallic molybdenum
(JCPDS card no. 89-4896), and the other diffraction peaks labeled
as “★” can be indexed as orthorhombic phase Mo2C (JCPDS card no. 79-0744). The results of XRD analysis show
that MoS2 has been completely reduced to metallic molybdenum
by metallic sodium. Meanwhile, part of the newly formed molybdenum
has reacted with the newly formed carbon (produced from Na thermal
reduction of waste PVC) to produce Mo2C, which can be expressed
as 3  

Figure 4d shows the XRD pattern of the obtained product from
the reaction of molybdenum sulfide, metallic sodium, and waste PVC
at 600 °C for 5 h. All the diffraction peaks in Figure 4d can be indexed as orthorhombic
phase Mo2C (JCPDS card no. 79-0744), which reveals that
the MoS2 can completely convert into Mo2C under
the present experimental conditions for 5 h.

On the basis of
the abovementioned experimental results, the chemical reaction of
synthesizing Mo2C nanoparticles can be represented as follows 4  

Because the ΔfHm values of Na2S (−364.8
kJ/mol) and NaCl (−411.2 kJ/mol) are much negative, a large
amount of heat generated in the process may promote the formation
of Mo2C. Besides, the excess metallic sodium could melt
(melting point of sodium is 97.8 °C) at the reaction temperature,
providing liquid medium for the formation of Mo2C.

Moreover, the effect of the reaction temperature on the formation
of Mo2C nanoparticles has been investigated. The reaction
temperature is a key factor in the formation of Mo2C. When
the temperature is 550 °C, the main product is Mo2C with poor crystallinity (Figure 5a). When the temperature is below 500 °C, the
product is amorphous (Figure 5b). Therefore, the optimum temperature for synthesis of Mo2C is about 600 °C.

Figure 5 (a) XRD pattern
of the
product obtained at 550 °C and (b) XRD pattern of the product
obtained at 500 °C.

Three typical XRD patterns of
the Mo2C products obtained at different temperatures (650,
700, and 800 °C) are shown in Figure 6A. Curves (a–c) are the XRD patterns
of the products obtained at 650, 700, and 800 °C, respectively.
All the XRD patterns in Figure 6A indicate that the obtained products are highly crystalline
Mo2C. Along with the reaction temperature increasing, XRD
peaks become sharper and the intensities of XRD peaks increase. These
results indicate that the higher reaction temperature promotes the
formation of molybdenum carbide of high crystallinity. TEM images
of the obtained products are shown in Figure 6B–D. From the TEM images, all the
obtained Mo2C products consist of nanoparticles. The sizes
of the obtained Mo2C products increase along with the increase
of the reaction temperature.

at different temperatures (B) 650, (C) 700, and (D) 800 °C.

3 Conclusions
In this article, Mo2C nanoparticles
have been prepared by using waste PVC as a carbon source at 600 °C
in an autoclave. The effect of reaction temperature on the crystallinity
of the obtained product has been studied. This synthetic method may
be hopefully used to synthesize other transition-metal carbides at
low temperature.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Chemicals
Waste PVC used in the experiment was collected from waste PVC hose
and cut into foils. Molybdenum sulfide and metallic sodium were purchased
from Shanghai Chemical Reagents Company without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Molybdenum
Carbide
Typically, molybdenum sulfide (0.32 g), waste PVC
(0.10 g), and metallic Na (1.80 g) were put into a stainless-steel
autoclave of 20 mL capacity. After the autoclave was sealed and put
into an electronic furnace, the electronic furnace was heated from
room temperature to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min
and kept at 600 °C for 10 h, and then cooled to room temperature
naturally. The product collected from the autoclave was washed with
dilute HCl (1.0 mol/L), distilled water, and alcohol to remove the
byproducts. Finally, the obtained product was dried under vacuum at
60 °C for 5 h.

4.3 Characterization
The obtained products were investigated
by XRD (Philips X’Pert diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation
λ = 1.54178 Å), FESEM (JEOL-JSM-6700F), and HRTEM (JEOL-2010,
200 kV). The magnetization measurement was investigated by using a
SQUID magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) in the temperature range
of 3–25 K with an applied field of H = 10
Oe.
