A GeNi alloy diffusion barrier for
contacts on bismuth antimony
telluride is proposed. Multiple gold contact diffusion barriers were
tested at different thermal aging conditions in air and reducing atmospheres.
Among all diffusion barriers, the GeNi alloy barrier shows the best
performance for bulk samples with no substantial degradation of the
contact resistance, no contact color change, and no change of thermoelectric
properties. We observed DAu–GeNi = (9.8 ± 2.7) × 10–20 m2/s
within the GeNi alloy barrier, which is 4 times smaller than DAu–BiSbTe. The presence of the initial
Ge layer also proves to be effective in reducing nickel diffusion
yielding DNi–BiSbTe = (8.57 ±
0.49) × 10–19 m2/s. During GeNi
alloy formation, Ge diffusion into BiSbTe produces GeTe, which apparently
blocks the van der Waals gaps eliminating Au and Ni fast diffusion
pathways. Thermal aging of BiSbTe nanowires shows that Au and Ni diffusion
degrades the thermoelectric power factor, whereas the GeNi alloy barrier
sample is mostly preserved. The GeNi alloy barrier is a reliable solution
to long-term thermal applications of BiTe-based materials.

Introduction
BiTe- and BiSe-based materials have a
unique crystal structure
with large spacing between the group VIa (Te or Se) atoms along the c-axis direction because of bonding by relatively weak van
der Waals forces. Bi2Te3,1−5 Bi2Se3,3 and BixSb2–xTe34 are examples of
group V–VI materials containing van der Waals gaps. These materials
are known as topological insulators6−8 with great potential
for thermoelectric applications.3,9−12 The stability and performance of electrical and thermal contacts
for long-term thermoelectric applications are one of the most important
topics for research and industrial devices. Gold is a desirable metal
contact because of its chemical inertness and high electrical and
thermal conductivities. However, a large contact resistivity (∼10–8 to 10–9 Ω m2)
between Au and BiTe-based materials is reported.13,14 This limitation is also observed for other common metal contacts
such as Ag and Cu. In addition, these metals diffuse along the direction
of the van der Waals gaps15−18 limiting high temperature or thermal contact annealing
applications.19−25

Although Au solubility in BiTe-based materials is low, its
fast
diffusion causes material loss, resulting in contact degradation proportional
to the operating temperature.18 BiSbTe
and BiTe-based thermoelectrics have their largest dimensionless figure
of merit (ZT) from 45 to 200 °C.26−29 For example, nanocrystalline p-type BixSb2–xTe3 has a peak ZT of 1.4 at 100 °C.27 To
ensure the best thermoelectric performance, a large temperature gradient
is preferred, so that the operating temperature at the hot end would
be higher than the temperature at peak ZT. Thermoelectric
devices operating at such a high temperature must have insignificant
contact diffusion to be reliable in long-term applications.19

Contact diffusion barriers such as nickel
and cobalt have been
employed to prevent Au diffusion, but they are still permeable to
Au, resulting in contact material loss and electrical contact degradation.19,30,31 In fact, Ni strongly diffuses
into BiTe-based materials,30,32 so it is not a desirable
choice for long-term high-temperature thermoelectric applications.
In this work, a GeNi alloy barrier for Au contacts on BiSbTe is explored.
We found that the GeNi alloy barrier does not alter the electrical
contact characteristics and it preserves the contact appearance even
after long-term thermal aging studies.

Experimental Methods
The electrical contact resistance
for bulk samples was evaluated by the transfer length method33 (Figure 1A). E-beam contact evaporation through a shadow mask was employed
to make electrical contacts on Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 bulk polycrystalline samples. The diffusion barrier test
was carried out by first evaporating the barrier material, immediately
followed by 1000 nm Au evaporation. Ni (100 nm), W (100 nm), Ge (100
nm), or Ge (80 nm)/Ni (100 nm) were tested as diffusion barriers.
The Ge/Ni barrier was rapid thermal annealed (RTA) at 350 °C
for 3 min in forming gas in order to produce a germanium–nickel
alloy (GeNi).34 The resistances of the
samples were measured right after contact deposition (the GeNi/Au
sample was annealed at 350 °C for 3 min before resistance measurement)
and kept at ambient conditions for 5 days. After that period, bulk
samples were tested before and after thermal aging at 250 °C
in forming gas (N2 95%, H2 5%) up to 5 h, or
at 200 °C in air up to 2 weeks. The 5 day waiting period ensured
that any contact resistivity change after thermal aging is the result
of material diffusion rather than contact degradation due to ambient
exposure. Energy-dispersive system (EDS) was carried out on an FEI
dual-beam focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope and the atomic
ratios were analyzed by EDAX genesis software. EDS concentration profile
studies for thermally aged contacts were carried out on thermal-evaporated
BiSbTe on silicon samples.

For BiSbTe nanowires (NWs), we
measured 4-probe electrical resistivity,
contact resistivity, and Seebeck coefficient from 25 to 310 K to evaluate
the influence of thermal aging for Au, Ni/Au, and GeNi/Au contacts.
The thermoelectric measurement platform was patterned by a combination
of photo- and electron-beam lithographies35 on a ⟨100⟩ silicon wafer with 1 μm thermal silicon
dioxide on the surface. Contacts were patterned on the substrate by
photolithography followed by the sequential deposition of 5 nm Cr
and 50 nm Au. An e-beam lithography (EBL) procedure was carried out
to pattern a thin line perpendicularly crossing the bottom contact
lines of about 400 nm wide and 23 μm long for BiSbTe NW evaporation
(Figure 1B left inset,
blue line). After e-beam resist development, oxygen plasma at 30 W
for 3 min was carried out, and the exposed gold contacts at the patterned
regions were etched with I2/KI aqueous solution for 20
s (Figure 1B left inset)
followed by deionized (DI) water rinse. Then, the sample was exposed
to 1:6 buffered oxide etch solution for 10 s followed by DI water
rinse. The sample was placed in a thermal evaporation unit to deposit
about 300 nm BiSbTe from Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 source material. After lift-off in acetone, a second EBL step was
carried out again to pattern the four top contact lines on the NW
(Figure 1B left inset,
yellow lines). The following metal recipes were e-beam evaporated
for the top contacts: 5 nm Cr (adhesion layer)/300 nm Au (referred
to as Au contact sample), 100 nm Ni/250 nm Au, or 80 nm Ge/100 nm
Ni/250 nm Au. The thermally evaporated BiSbTe NW has an elemental
composition of Bi (8.84%), Sb (61.38%), and Te (29.78%) (Figure 1C). These NW devices
were thermally aged under vacuum in forming gas (N2 95%,
H2 5%) for various lengths of time.

The thermal and
electronic properties of the samples were measured
from 25 to 310 K in a helium closed-loop cryostat. The electrical
resistivity, ρ, was calculated from 4-probe resistance data
at each temperature using the dimensions (cross-sectional area and
length) measured by SEM. The Seebeck coefficient (S = −ΔVth/ΔΤ) was extracted by measuring ΔVth when a dc current was applied on the heater producing
a temperature gradient ΔT between the two middle
contacts.35 Electrical contacts were confirmed
to be Ohmic for Ni/Au and GeNi/Au contact samples within the entire
temperature range while the Au contact sample was not Ohmic below
140 K. Measurements were taken on the same sample before and after
thermal aging to determine the changes caused by contact diffusion.

Contact Thermal Aging Studies for Bulk Samples
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Au resistances for bulk devices
are shown in Figure 1D for samples before and after thermal aging. After thermal aging,
the slope of the linear regression does not appreciably change, indicating
that the resistance of bulk Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 is not affected. However, the intercepts are different because
of a change of contact resistance. Au diffuses into the Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 crystal matrix through the van der
Waals gaps during thermal aging.15,19 A consequence
of Au diffusion into the Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 material is electrical contact degradation, and contact and substrate
color change. The contact resistivity for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Au bulk sample increased from (3.39 ± 0.17) ×
10–9 to (4.88 ± 0.91) × 10–9 Ω m2 after thermal aging (Table 1).

Table 1 also shows
the contact resistivity for several barrier recipes before and after
thermal aging in forming gas at 250 °C for 5 h. The Ni/Au sample
data yielded a smaller slope after thermal aging (Figure 2) because of a decrease of
bulk Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 resistance. Although
Ni is commonly used as a diffusion barrier for contacts on BiTe-based
materials, Ni actually diffuses into the substrate forming NiTe compounds.19,30 Ni diffusion in BiTe-based materials was reported by Lan et al.30 with a Ni diffusion coefficient at 500 K of
1.8 × 10–17 m2/s in p-type BiSbTe,
while in n-type BiSeTe, the Ni diffusion coefficient was found to
be 3.1 × 10–14 m2/s. The smaller
contact resistivity and bulk resistance for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Ni/Au sample after thermal aging is probably
due to a relatively large Ni diffusion.

Figure 2 Resistances for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/GeNi/Au
and Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Ni/Au samples before
and after thermal aging in forming gas at 250 °C for 5 h.

After thermal aging, the Ge/Au
sample was not electrically conductive,
and it presented contact discoloration without substrate discoloration
(Figure 3D). Ge and
Au form an eutectic mixture at 361 °C in nanostructured and bulk
materials.36,37 The Ge–Au eutectic has
a relatively small electrical conductivity, and it is commonly used
for Schottky diode contacts.38−41 The diffusion of Au in Ge is considered relatively
slow.42 The diffusion length calculated
by 2√(DAu–Get) (where DAu–Ge = diffusion coeff.
of Au in Ge, t = time) is ca. 13 nm after thermal
aging assuming DAu–Ge = 1.6 ×
10–21 m2/s.42 Thus, the Ge layer acted as an effective diffusion barrier for Au,
but it is not practical for thermoelectric applications.

forming gas. (A) Ge/Ni before thermal aging. (B) No barrier. (C) 100
nm Ni. (D) 100 nm Ge. (E) 80 nm Ge/100 nm Ni. All the devices before
thermal aging had the same Au contact color appearance.

Among all samples subjected to thermal aging, the
GeNi/Au contact
showed an insignificant increase of electrical contact resistivity,
no apparent contact color change, and no appreciable degradation of
the Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 bulk resistance
(Table 1, Figures 2 and 3E). The Ni/Au and the Ge/Au contacts do not perform as well
as the GeNi/Au contact. During RTA, GeNi is formed in the Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Ge/Ni/Au sample.34 The GeNi layer is expected to have a relatively low electrical
resistivity. A contact resistivity of about 2 × 10–11 Ω m2 for a GeNi contact on n-type Ge substrate
was reported.34 We conclude that the initial
RTA step for the Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/Ge/Ni/Au
sample is fundamental for achieving a small contact resistivity.

During thermal aging, the GeNi barrier restricted the Au diffusion
into bulk Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 based on
the results shown in Figures 2 and 3. The concentration depth profiles
measured by EDS after thermal aging for Au and GeNi/Au contacts on
thermal evaporated BiSbTe samples are shown in Figure 4. Au diffusion reached to about 600 nm without
the GeNi barrier (Figure 4A). Assuming that the EDS intensity (I) is
directly proportional to the concentration, the diffusion coeff. of
Au in BiSbTe can be found by (I(x,t) – I∞)/(IS – I∞) = erfc(x/(2√Dt)), where t is time, D is the diffusion
coefficient, x is the distance from the BiSbTe/Au
interface, I(x,t) is the Au EDS intensity as a function of x and t, IS is the Au EDS intensity
at the BiSbTe/Au interface (assumed to be constant), and I∞ is the residual Au EDS intensity far from the
BiSbTe/Au interface. We found DAu–BiSbTe = (4.28 ± 0.02) × 10–19 m2/s, which is considerably smaller than the Ni diffusion coeff. in
BiSbTe.

Figure 4 EDS line profile after 5 h at 250 °C in forming gas. (A) BiSbTe/Au
without barrier. (B) BiSbTe/GeNi/Au.

The Au concentration profile shown in Figure 4B (BiSbTe/GeNi/Au sample) turned out to be
different. For practical purposes, the GeNi layer is assumed to be
located where Ge and Ni are observed in the EDS spectrum (Figure 4B). Within the GeNi
layer, the Au concentration is not proportional to erfc(x/(2√Dt)). In fact, the Au concentration can
be represented by the diffusion transport in a two-layer media (eq 1), where L is the thickness of the first layer from the Au interface and k is the Au equilibrium concentration ratio at the two-layer
interface. In principle, it is reasonable to assume that only two
layers are present (GeNi and BiSbTe layers) and that the diffusion
coeff. of Au in those layers are different. 1  

On the basis of the Au EDS profile shown in Figure 4B, L is observed to be ca.
125 nm, so DAu–GeNi = (9.8 ±
2.7) × 10–20 m2/s was obtained,
assuming that DAu–BiSbTe remained
the same as observed in Figure 4A. It seems that the initial RTA step resulted in a substantial
diffusion of Au into the entire sample while the GeNi layer was produced.
During thermal aging, the slower diffusion of Au in the GeNi layer
reduces the amount of Au diffusing into the BiSbTe. 2  

From Figure 2, nickel
diffusion in BiSbTe/GeNi/Au seems insignificant because the contact
resistance did not decrease and the overall resistance of bulk BiSbTe
did not change as observed for the BiSbTe/Ni/Au sample. No appreciable
Ni is observed beyond ca. 200 nm from the BiSbTe/GeNi interface (Figure 4B). Ni diffusion
in the BiSbTe can be modeled by the Gaussian drive-in diffusion equation
(eq 2), where γ
is a fitting constant. DNi–BiSbTe = (8.57 ± 0.49) × 10–19 m2/s was obtained from eq 2, which is about 20 times smaller than the previously reported DNi–BiSbTe value.30 GeTe alloy can be produced in situ during RTA.43 Unlike BiTe-based materials, there are no van der Waals
gaps between the Te planes in GeTe, thus Ge-rich bismuth telluride
materials should have a similar crystalline structure.44 GeTe could have formed at the interface of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/GeNi closing the van der
Waals gaps along the [001] direction and preventing a path for the
fast diffusion of Au and Ni.

Long-term thermal aging studies
carried out in air revealed that
the GeNi barrier is also effective in avoiding contact discoloration
and contact resistivity degradation (Figure 5). The GeNi barrier is further tested for
nanoscale thermoelectric devices. Nanoscale devices should magnify
any change of the thermoelectric properties because contact diffusion
would occur in a relatively large portion of the BiSbTe NW. Thus,
the influence of contact diffusion in BiSbTe NW could be measured
in a substantially shorter time compared to the one for bulk samples.

resistivity change as a function of aging time in air

h. Discoloration is only observed for the BiSbTe/Au sample.

Contact Thermal Aging Studies
for Nanometer-Scale Devices
To better understand the influence
of Au diffusion and the performance
of Ni and GeNi barriers on contact thermal aging, studies on NW devices
were carried out. Figure 6A shows the 4-probe resistance of the BiSbTe NW samples. None
of the samples have electrical contact before annealing. The GeNi/Au
sample achieved Ohmic contact after RTA (3 min. at 350 °C) because
of the formation of GeNi alloy45−49 while the Ni/Au and Au contact samples achieve Ohmic contacts only
after 1 h of thermal aging in forming gas at 250 °C. Au and Ni/Au
contacts absorbed into the BiSbTe NW if annealed at 350 °C for
3 min in forming gas. This observation supports the fact that GeNi
alloy is a superior diffusion barrier for Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3.

Figure 6 (A) Resistivity and (B) contact resistivity vs temperature.
Au
resistivity data in (A) are multiplied by 0.6 and contact resistivity
data in (B) are multiplied by 5 × 10–4. The
negative contact resistivity values for Ni/Au sample result from experimental
error being larger than the value of the resistivity.

The contact resistivity of GeNi/Au and Ni/Au contacts
are more
than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the one for Au contact (Figure 6B). The contact resistivity
of the Ni/Au sample decreased from 1 to 8 h thermal aging conditions.
On the other hand, the contact resistivity of the GeNi/Au sample does
not present any detectable change after the first annealing. The Au
sample after 1 h of annealing has the largest electrical resistivity,
so Au diffusion not only degraded the contact but also negatively
influenced the electrical conduction of the NW. By comparing 1–8
h thermal aging, the resistivity of NW for the Ni/Au device increased
about 10% while the resistivity of NW for the GeNi/Au device has no
significant change. It is reasonable to assume that the contact metal
diffusion in Ni/Au degraded the NW, resulting in an increased 4-probe
resistivity. For GeNi/Au sample, the electrical resistivity of the
NW increased after 1 h aging, but it remained essentially the same
after 8 h of aging. Au diffusion into the NW could degrade the electrical
conductivity of the NWs for both Ni/Au and GeNi/Au. However, the fact
that after 1 h aging the 4-probe resistance did not change for the
GeNi/Au sample implies that the NW degradation process should have
stopped.

The Seebeck coefficient versus temperature (Figure 7) shows the dependences
of the three samples
at the different aging conditions. The Seebeck coefficient at 300
K of the Ni/Au sample decreased nearly 60% after 8 h of thermal aging
while the GeNi/Au sample has almost the same Seebeck coefficient.
The Seebeck coefficient peaks at about 100 K for the GeNi/Au sample
annealed for 3 min at 350 °C in forming gas. This peak is associated
with the presence of a small band gap conduction channel in the BiSbTe
NW, and it is reduced after thermal aging for the other GeNi/Au samples.
The surface states in BiTe-based materials are influenced by doping.50 Our BiSbTe NWs are Te depleted, which may have
different surface state bands and unpredictable influence on Seebeck
coefficient, especially at lower temperature.

Figure 7 Seebeck coefficient vs
of BiSbTe samples with Au, Ni/Au, and GeNi/Au
contact at different thermal aging conditions.

At 300 K, the power factor (S2/ρ)
shows a clear trend between metal diffusion and thermal aging (Table 2). Contact metal doping
could create centers that quench charges and degrade both electrical
conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. The power factor drastically
decreased for the Ni/Au sample after 8 h of thermal aging while S2/ρ for GeNi/Au sample is nearly constant
(Table 2). ZT is one of the lead parameters associated with the performance
of thermoelectric materials. ZT is directly proportional
to S2/ρ and inversely proportional
to the thermal conductivity (k). The small k values reported for BiTe-based materials are mainly dictated
by phonon scattering at the van der Waals gaps.1−5 Au and Ni diffusions in BiSbTe/GeNi/Au are greatly
reduced by the formation of GeTe at the BiSbTe/GeNi interface resulting
in the blocking of van der Waals gaps close to the interface (Figure 4B). Thus, the thermal
conductivity for the BiSbTe should remain unchanged because of the
preservation of bulk van der Waals gaps.

Conclusions
Contact degradation of BiSbTe-based materials is observed due to
the diffusion of Au. In BiSbTe NWs, the diffusion of Au contacts caused
a degradation of thermoelectric properties. Ni/Au forms Ohmic contact
with small contact resistivity, but Ni is not a diffusion barrier
to prevent Au diffusion during long-term thermal aging. For Ni/Au
contacts, the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient decrease
because of Ni diffusion into the bulk BiSbTe. Ge/Ni/Au contact becomes
Ohmic after short thermal annealing because of the formation of GeNi
alloy. We observed that the GeNi layer prevents Au and Ni diffusion
into the BiSbTe. We suspect that the formation of GeTe at the BiSbTe/Ge
interface blocks the van der Waals gaps limiting contact diffusion.
Our studies on BiSbTe NWs show that GeNi alloy preserves the NW electrical
resistivity and Seebeck coefficient, hence it is a superior option
for high-temperature operations.
