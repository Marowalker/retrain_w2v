A series
of nanocomposites based on polyamide (NL16, PA) filter
membranes containing metal nanoparticles (NPs) have been prepared
by filtration under reduced pressure of the metal colloids. The ensuing
materials were then investigated as substrates for surface-enhanced
Raman scattering (SERS) imaging studies envisaging the spectroscopic
detection of vestigial organic pollutants dissolved in contaminated
water. The organic dye crystal violet (CV) was used here as a model
pollutant because it is a hazardous compound present in certain effluent
waters. Moreover this compound is well-known for its strong SERS activity,
which is clearly advantageous in the context of material development
for SERS. Indeed, several preparative strategies were employed to
prepare PA-based composites, and the impact on SERS detection was
investigated. These include the use of chemical and morphological
distinct plasmonic NPs (Ag, Au), a variable metal load and changing
the order of addition of the analytical specimens. These studies demonstrate
that the parameters employed in the fabrication of the SERS substrates
have a strong impact on the Raman signal enhancement. The use of Raman
imaging during the fabrication process allows establishing improvements
that translate to better performances of the substrates in the analyte
detection. The results have been interpreted by considering an integrated
set of operational parameters that include the affinity of CV molecules
to the substrate, amount and dispersion of NPs in the PA membranes,
and the detection method.  Noteworthy the use of SERS analysis
assisted with Raman imaging allowed achieving a detection limit for
CV as low as 100 aM in ultrapure water and 10 fM in real samples.

Introduction
The contamination of
natural waters with organic dyes has been
of general concern because these compounds are potentially harmful.1−3 In natural waters, such organic dyes can reduce sunlight penetration
and deplete the dissolved oxygen. Also, mutagenic and carcinogenic
intermediates can be produced by hydrolysis or oxidation of such organic
dyes, with impact in aquatic organisms as well as animals and humans.1,2,4,5

Crystal violet (CV) is a synthetic basic cationic dye of the triarylmethane
type that imparts a beautiful violet color to aqueous solutions.5 CV is widely used for dyeing textiles and used
as a component of printing inks and paints.5 In addition, for many years, CV was used in veterinary medicine
for the treatment of fungal infections in aquacultures; in consequence,
vestigial traces of CV have been found in aquaculture products, namely,
in fish.7 Currently, the presence of CV
in food is not allowed in the European Union.

Environmental
monitoring on a routine basis and in end user local
points might mitigate pernicious effects, but there is need of effective
and easy implementation methods to detect vestigial amounts of CV
in effluent waters. In the past decades, analytical techniques based
on the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect have emerged
as an alternative strategy for the detection of specific water pollutants
because of its relevant features, such as high sensitivity associated
with unique spectroscopic fingerprints of selected compounds. SERS
can also be regarded as a complementary tool to other  techniques,
namely, in analytical protocols employed in field analysis that use
portable Raman equipment.6 Our own interest
in this topic has been guided by the development of reproducible substrates
that are sensitive to target analytes, which is a crucial aspect in
SERS analysis.

Progress has been made for the fabrication of
stable, low-cost,
and active SERS substrates with large-area uniformity that allows
reproducible signal Raman enhancements.7−10 Moreover, metal nanoparticles (NPs) assembled
on paper or other flexible materials offer new possibilities for developing
low-cost and facilely handled SERS sensors.11−17 An interesting advancement in the fabrication of filtering sensors
has been reported by Yu and White, which used a straightforward method
to fabricate handy SERS substrates composed of polyamide (PA) membranes
and Ag NPs.12 Briefly, the colloidal NPs
were retained in the PA membrane via syringe filtration and then the
sample solution was passed through the metal-loaded filter membrane.
The same authors have demonstrated that the PA/Ag filters could detect
low concentrations of rhodamine 6G (R6G), melamine, and malathion
in water but without exploring Raman imaging. Here, we have prepared
PA-based composites loaded with metal NPs by filtering under reduced
pressure the respective colloids. These nanocomposites were prepared
by using colloids (Ag, Au) having different particles’ morphologies
(spheres and stars) and variable metal load. Using Raman imaging coupled
with SERS analysis, our studies demonstrate that the variation of
such parameters has a strong impact on the Raman signal enhancement.
Also, we wish to demonstrate that by employing both Raman imaging
and SERS analysis, not only the substrate fabrication can be optimized
but also lower detection limits can be achieved.

Results and Discussion
Aqueous solutions of CV have strong absorption in the visible because
of a band peaked at 586 nm that extends to a spectral window that
includes the excitation wavelength (532 nm) used for acquiring the
Raman spectra (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1-1). The Raman spectrum of CV aqueous solution (0.1 M)
is presented in Figure S1-2 (see the Supporting Information). Because the excitation wavelength is within the
wavelength region of absorption for CV, there is a Raman resonance
effect that can be explored together with the surface-enhanced Raman
effect for detecting CV molecules close to plasmonic metal surfaces
(surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering).

The metal NPs
used in this research have been prepared using distinct
colloidal syntheses. The colloidal NPs employed in the preparation
of PA-based composites were selected based on their facile loading
into the PA membranes and because they are known to have good SERS
activity. Figure 1 illustrates
the visible spectra of the metal NPs with distinct nature and morphologies
together with the corresponding transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
images of the colloids. A solution of 20 mL divided by four portions
of 5 mL (4 × 5 mL) of each colloid sample was passed through
a PA membrane and dried at room temperature overnight, to obtain the
respective NPs/PA substrate.

Figure 1 Visible spectra and TEM images of the metal
colloids: (a) Ag nanospheres
(Ag NPs), (b) Au nanospheres with 10 nm average size (Au-10 NPs),
(c) Au nanospheres with 30 nm average size (Au-30 NPs), and (d) Au
nanostars (Au NSs).

In the first stage, Raman
imaging of the NPs/PA substrates was
performed after dropping an aliquot (10 μL) of an aqueous solution
of CV (100 μM), to assess the respective SERS response to CV. Figure 2 shows the average
Raman spectra of CV (100 μM) in the NPs/PA substrates, obtained
from the spectral data acquired in Raman imaging. First, it is observed
that the SERS spectra in Figure 2a–d are similar to the conventional Raman spectra
of a CV aqueous solution (0.1 M, presented in Figure S1-2). Control experiments recording the Raman spectra
of aqueous solutions with the same concentration in the CV analyte
(100 μM) did not give a Raman signal. Also, the Raman spectra
of neat PA membranes, that is, without metal NPs, with the addition
of the same amount of CV, did not give Raman bands that could be ascribed
to CV, in all areas analyzed over the PA substrate (Figure 2e).

Figure 2 Average Raman spectra
of CV (100 μM) obtained from the spectral
data acquired in Raman imaging using the following samples as substrates:
(a) Ag/PA; (b) Au-10/PA; (c) Au-30/PA; (d) Au NSs/PA; and (e) PA (excitation
at 532 nm, 40 × 40 μm, 150 points per 150 lines, one acquisition
with 0.05 s each point, 15 μW).

These results demonstrate that there is a SERS effect for
CV in
the NPs/PA nanocomposites because of the presence of the metallic
NPs incorporated within the PA matrices. For comparative purposes,
the conventional Raman spectra of both PA filter membranes and Ag/PA
composites are also presented in Figure S2 (see the Supporting Information). Moreover, the spectra were considered
as representative after analyzing several areas of the substrate using
Raman mapping and also by randomly selecting points on the substrate
(10 000 μm × 10 000 μm) and recording
the corresponding SERS spectra (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Although these results show slight changes in
the Raman intensities, it is clear that at this scale the SERS signals
are always observed regardless the region analyzed. Figure 2 also shows that under the
conditions used, there are no significant differences in the SERS
spectra of CV recorded with the different substrates.

The assignment
of the CV Raman bands was based on literature reports
including vibrational spectroscopic data for this organic dye.18−20 In brief, there are three different groups of vibrational modes;
those associated with the central carbon atom (C+-phenyl
vibrations—up to 450 cm–1), nitrogen atoms
(N-phenyl stretching—between 1350 and 1400
cm–1), and phenyl rings (skeletal ring vibrations
and ring C–H deformations—between 400 and 1300 cm–1 and ring stretching modes—above 1400 cm–1). Raman bands were observed for C+-phenyl
bending at 437 cm–1, ring C–H bending at
1171 cm–1, ring skeletal vibration of radical orientation
at 915 cm–1, N-phenyl stretching
at 1371 cm–1, and ring C–C stretching at
1531 and 1620 cm–1. The N-phenyl
stretching band at 1371 cm–1 and the ring C–C
stretching band at 1620 cm–1 were used to perform
Raman imaging (obtained with the integrated intensity of the respective
band), with the last one often used to calculate the enhancement factors
in reported SERS studies.20,21 This result also indicates
that the substrate containing Ag NPs presents the best SERS activity
among the substrates tested; thus, in the subsequent experiments,
the substrates loaded with Ag NPs have been preferentially used.

The commercial membranes used in this research are made of pure
PA and normally employed as filters for water clarification and sterile
filtration. These membranes are relatively cheap and mechanically
robust during colloidal filtration, which make them suitable to fabricate
the SERS substrates described here. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images presented in the supporting
information (Figure S4) show that the PA
membranes have a fibrous microstructure that result from a network
of interlaced PA microfibers. The root mean square surface roughness
of a typical PA membrane was 282 nm over 15 × 15 μm2 area, as determined by AFM. The SEM images of the Ag-loaded
PA samples (Figure 3a) show that the metal NPs can be supported by the fibrillar structure,
thus providing regions with a high density of SERS-active NPs. The
homogeneity of SERS-active solid substrates, in particular at the
nanoscale, has been a challenging topic, which is crucial to implement
such materials as analytical platforms.17,23−26 To assess the homogeneity of the metal-loaded PA substrates, the
Raman image showing the spatial distribution of CV molecules (100
μM) on the Ag/PA membrane surfaces was acquired and is presented
in Figure 3b for the
best SERS operational conditions. High-resolution Raman imaging was
performed using 22 500 spectra by raster-scanning the laser
beam over a surface area of 40 × 40 μm, providing a spatial
resolution of approximately 0.27 μm. The integration of the
absolute area underneath the band at 1371 cm–1 (N-phenyl stretching) was used to establish the color intensity
and create the Raman image. Thus, the brighter colors in the image
indicate regions with stronger SERS signal because of the presence
of CV molecules adsorbed on the Ag NPs, simultaneously indicating
the distribution of the Ag NPs over the membrane. The Raman image
in Figure 3b shows
that the Ag NPs are evenly dispersed over the surface of the PA membrane,
which is in agreement with the SEM results discussed above.

Figure 3 (a) Backscattered
SEM images of Ag/PA; (b) Raman image obtained
using the integrated intensity of the band at 1371 cm–1 in the SERS spectrum of CV (100 μM) using the Ag/PA membranes
as substrates; (c) selected SERS spectra of CV collected at different
points as shown by the arrows.

To develop reproducible SERS substrates based on these PA
nanocomposites,
it is important to evaluate the in-depth dispersion of the metal NPs
in the PA matrix. In this context, three-dimensional (3D) Raman images
are of great interest because they provide information about the distribution
of the Ag NPs throughout the analyzed substrate (surface and interior).
Thus, 3D Raman images of the Ag–PA filter membrane (4 ×
5 mL) probed with a CV aqueous solution (10 μL, 100 μM)
were built by the acquisition of a series of two-dimensional (2D)
images along the z-direction (down to −5 μm).
The 2D Raman images with 2.5 μm apart in the z-direction are shown in Figure 4. The 2D images were then combined into a 3D image
stack (Figure 4-bottom).
The resulting 3D image provides information about the bulk distribution
homogeneity of assemblies comprising Ag NPs and CV molecules in the
PA filter membranes. The white arrows in Figure 4 show positions in the substrate where the
Raman signal of CV was not observed at z = 0 μm
(surface of the substrate) but where it was clearly detected down
at z = −5 μm (in spots marked by green
arrows, vertically aligned with the surface ones). This result confirms
the homogeneous distribution of Ag NPs inside the PA matrix. During
the filtration of the metal colloid under reduced pressure, a certain
amount of Ag NPs are attached to the PA fibers at the surface but
others migrate through the porous matrix and are retained within the
interior of the PA membranes. Therefore, when a drop of CV is placed
on the top of the substrate, the CV molecules (∼1.4 nm) diffuse
through the porous matrix and interact with the Ag NPs distributed
inside the PA membrane. Results reported by Kudelski have shown that
relatively large molecules, such as those of CV, can interact with
SERS-active sites formed by rearrangement of the metal NPs (likely
mechanism in metal sols) and also after diffusion toward already arranged
SERS-active sites.25

Figure 4 In-depth Raman images
obtained using the integrated intensity of
the Raman band at 1371 cm–1 in the SERS spectrum
of CV using the Ag/PA filter membrane as substrate; values of the
respective depth are shown on the top of each image and the vertical
bar on the left shows the color profile and the relative Raman intensity
scale. A 3D Raman image of the nanocomposite is shown (bottom-right),
created with stacked in-depth Raman images.

The dark regions indicated by the white arrows in the 2D
Raman
image taken at z = 0 μm (surface) can be associated
with the deformation of the membrane because of the filtration method
under reduced pressure used for the substrate preparation. PA filter
membranes with a porous microstructure of 800 nm (instead of the 200
nm used in this work) were also tested and gave the same type of dark
regions in the Raman image. Using a similar preparation method, but
with a PA filter membrane (200 nm) that is coated with Ag NPs without
filtration under reduced pressure, the Raman images did not present
those dark regions on the surface, and the Ag NPs can only be detected
at the surface (Figure S5).

It has
been reported that SERS activity in a solid substrate is
highest in metal nanojunctions (hotspots), because of a strongly enhanced
local electromagnetic field when irradiated with laser light.12,26−31 In principle, for the PA membranes investigated here, the formation
of such hotspots can be tuned by adjusting the amount of metal NPs
and aggregation state in the matrix. This can be simply assessed by
varying the volume of the Ag colloid that passes through the PA filter
membrane, in distinct filtering steps, keeping the total volume constant.
Thus, let us consider a total volume of 20 mL in the Ag colloid, used
in each of the following filtration procedures (under reduced pressure):
1 × 20, 2 × 10 and 4 × 5 mL. Figure 5 shows the SERS images of the spatial distribution
of CV molecules in different Ag/PA membranes, prepared as described
above, after dropping an aliquot (10 μL) of an aqueous solution
of CV (100 μM). Raman images were generated using the intensity
of the Raman band at 1371 cm–1 from 22 500
spectra. The brighter yellow areas at the surface of the substrate,
corresponding to the strongest SERS signal of CV, decreased from the
Ag/PA substrate obtained by filtering the Ag colloid in a single step
(1 × 20 mL) to the Ag/PA substrate obtained after multistep filtration.
The results shown previously in this paper were obtained with Ag/PA
substrates prepared using a 4 × 5 mL Ag colloid filtration (Figure 5c corresponds to Figure 3, presenting a different
color intensity scale).

Figure 5 Raman images obtained using the integrated intensity
of the Raman
band at 1371 cm–1 in the SERS spectra of CV using
the distinct Ag/PA substrates prepared after passing a total of 20
mL of the Ag colloid in different portions (a) 1 × 20, (b) 2
× 10, and (c) 4 × 5 mL. (d) Plots of the intensity of the
1370 and 1620 cm–1 CV Raman bands for Ag/PA substrates
prepared with 20 mL of Ag NPs using different volumes of Ag NPs (n = 22 500 spectra).

Figure 6a,b
shows
the 2D Raman images along the z-direction (down to
−5 μm) for both substrates prepared by filtration of
Ag NPs in 1 × 20 and 2 × 10 mL steps, respectively. For
the substrate obtained after filtration in a single step, the SERS
signal of CV is strongest at the surface of the substrate (z = 0 μm) (Figure 6a), decreasing in intensity as the SERS analysis is
performed in depth (along z).

Figure 6 In-depth Raman images
obtained using the integrated intensity of
the Raman band at 1371 cm–1 in the SERS spectra
of CV 100 μM using the Ag/PA prepared with (a) 1 × 20 and
(b) 2 × 10 mL of Ag NPs as substrates. Values of depth are shown
on the top. The vertical bar on the right shows the color profile
and the relative intensity scale.

The tendency shown in Figure 6a, and less in Figure 6b, of decreasing of the SERS signal of CV along the z-direction, is not observed for the Ag-loaded PA membranes
obtained in multistep filtrations. A plausible explanation for such
differences relates to the influence of the filtration method applied
to the colloid on the aggregation state of the Ag NPs entrapped in
the PA membranes. A single step filtration under reduced pressure
induces the formation of Ag
aggregates mostly at the solid/liquid interface over the membrane,
whereas the same amount of colloidal Ag NPs will be better distributed
within the PA bulk matrix when the same volume of Ag colloid is divided
in smaller portions for multistep filtration. It should be noticed
that this behavior was also observed for Ag/PA prepared with 4 ×
5 mL (Figure 4), in
which a similar SERS intensity of CV was observed along the z-direction, indicating a better distribution of the Ag
NPs inside the PA filter membrane.

This result was also confirmed
by SEM, where Ag NP aggregates are
observed for the substrate using a single step filtration, and a better
distribution of the Ag NPs is shown on the substrate in which the
volume of the Ag colloid was divided two times (Figure S6, Supporting Information).

To have additional evidence for the dependence of the SERS
activity
on the aggregation state of the Ag NPs in the composite membranes, distinct
total volumes of the Ag colloid have been employed in their fabrication.
Thus, Ag colloid was passed through the PA filter membranes in single
steps, using the following volumes in each: 20, 10, 5, and 2 mL. The
as-prepared Ag-loaded PA membranes were then evaluated as SERS substrates,
after the addition of CV solution (100 μM, 10 μL), by
monitoring the band of CV at 1371 cm–1 to generate
a Raman image (Figure 7). The plot of the average intensity of the N-phenyl
stretching mode at 1371 cm–1 and the C–C
stretching of the ring at 1620 cm–1 are also presented
in Figure 7e, for the
respective substrates. The SERS intensity for CV decreased from the
Ag/PA substrate obtained using 20 mL of the Ag colloid to the Ag/PA
substrate obtained by using the smallest volume of 2 mL. It should
be highlighted that the SERS intensity for CV using the Ag/PA substrate
with 20 mL of Ag colloid is slightly higher than the Ag/PA substrate
with 10 mL of Ag colloid; thus, in the subsequent experiments, the
substrates loaded with 10 mL of Ag colloid were used, which is a compromise
between SERS intensity and the Ag colloid used.

Figure 7 Raman images obtained
using the integrated intensity of the Raman
band at 1371 cm–1 in the SERS spectra of CV (100
μM, 10 μL) using Ag/PA substrates prepared with (a) 20,
(b) 10, (c) 5, and (d) 2 mL of the Ag colloid. (e) Plots of the intensity
of the 1370 and 1620 cm–1 CV Raman bands, respectively,
for Ag/PA substrates prepared with different volumes of Ag colloid
(average Raman intensity calculated from n = 22 500
spectra).

A great advantage in using the
PA membrane-based SERS substrates
is the ability to preconcentrate the analyte under study, similarly
to what happen in a solid-phase extraction method.12,22 The platforms presented here combine two important assets for chemical
analysis, the fast collection of the specimen and the in situ detection,
in this case by SERS.23 To collect the
analyte, two simple procedures can be employed, either by filtering
the sample solution or by just dropping some aliquots on the top of
the membrane. Figure 8a,b illustrates the results when the SERS performance of the filter
membranes was evaluated using both methods for sample preparation.
Hence, the Raman signal intensity was far better by filtering 10 mL
CV (aqueous solution 100 μM) than by dropping 10 μL of
solution with the same concentration over the membrane, which is line
with a better diffusion and extraction of the analyte within the matrix. Figure 8c also shows the
SERS spectrum of CV retained in the PA filter membranes prior to loading
of the colloidal Ag NPs (10 mL). In the latter case, less CV molecules
were retained in the PA membrane and available for adsorption in the
Ag NPs deposited afterward. Although the latter method is less SERS
effective, a detection limit for CV as low as 1 nM was still reached.
The focus here was to evaluate this method to detect organic dyes
in water, by selecting CV as a pollutant model because of their relevance
as potential contaminants in industrial effluents. Following this
objective, two other organic dyes were preliminarily analyzed in similar
conditions as those employed in the analysis of CV. Figure S7 shows that good SERS spectra were also obtained
for methylene blue (MB) and R6G (100 μM concentration) by using
the Ag/PA filter membranes as substrates.

Figure 8 SERS spectra of CV upon
(a) filtration under reduced pressure of
CV aqueous solution 100 μM), (b) drop and evaporation of the
same CV solution, and (c) addition of the CV solution before adding
the Ag NPs by filtration.

The usefulness of the Ag/PA filter membranes was also evaluated
as SERS platforms for monitoring vestigial CV in more complex matrices.
Thus, Ag/PA filter membranes (prepared by filtration of 10 mL of Ag
colloid in one step) were used in the extraction and SERS detection
of CV previously dissolved (at 100 μM concentration) in seawater
collected from Aveiro Estuary.

Figure 9 presents
the Raman images obtained with the integrated intensity of the characteristic
band of CV at 1370 cm–1 using Ag/PA as SERS substrate
for samples of CV-spiked Aveiro Estuary water. The SERS images show
the spatial distribution of CV molecules on the Ag/PA substrate, using
different CV concentrations. The detection limit of CV in the Aveiro
estuary water samples was 10 fM. The Raman spectra obtained for the
detection limits determination are presented in Figure 9d, and all characteristic Raman bands of
CV were clearly observed in such diluted samples. Plots of the intensity
of the 1370 and 1620 cm–1 CV Raman bands for various
CV concentrations are also presented in Figure 9e.

Figure 9 Raman images obtained with the integrated intensity
of the band
at 1371 cm–1 of CV recorded using Ag/PA membranes
as the SERS substrate for samples of CV spiked on Aveiro Estuary water
using different CV concentrations: (a) 1 μM; (b) 10 nM; and
(c) 10 fM. The vertical bar shows the color profile in each image,
with the relative intensity scale. d) Single SERS spectra of CV taken
from the Raman images in Aveiro Estuary water with several CV concentrations;
(e) Plots of the intensity of the 1371 and 1620 cm–1 CV Raman bands for various CV concentrations, using five different
samples (Ag/PA) for each concentration.

It should be highlighted that such lower SERS detection limits
for CV molecules could only be achieved using Raman imaging coupled
with SERS. Figure 9c shows the Raman image of the 1371 cm–1 vibrational
mode collected from the Ag/PA filter membrane with the lowest CV concentration
(10 fM) on Aveiro Estuary water. The Raman image demonstrates that
the SERS signal of CV is highly localized, corresponding only to a
few active Raman scattering sites on the Ag/PA filter membrane. The
brighter areas observed in Figure 9c clearly reveal that these hotspots promote a higher
enhancement of the CV Raman signal, making possible the detection
of CV molecules even from such a low analyte concentration. The SERS
spectra in Figure 9d are single Raman spectra taken from the brightness spots observed
in the respective Raman images (1 acquisition, 0.05 s).

For
the same experiment but using ultrapure water, the achieved
detection limit was 100 aM (Figure S8).
This result demonstrates that the Ag/PA filter membrane can be used
as a SERS substrate for CV detection in real samples, is not limited
to SERS analysis in ultrapure water CV solutions, and show extreme
SERS sensitivity and good reproducibility.

Conclusion
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated the potential of Raman imaging
methods to monitor the fabrication process of SERS substrates based
on PA filter membranes and loaded metal colloidal NPs. Raman imaging
coupled with SERS allows for adjusting operational parameters such
as the amount and dispersion of NPs in the PA membranes, the sample
preparation method, and also for monitoring the formation of active
SERS sites in distinct regions of the membranes. Because of the increasing
number of technologies requiring flexible SERS substrates, this approach
might give a new impetus for a better understanding of how the Ag
NPs incorporated in the matrix affect the SERS performance of the
substrates.

A number of advantages can be identified for the
use of these platforms
instead of conventional SERS substrates, namely, their flexibility,
efficient extraction of chemical compounds, low cost, and high surface
area, making these filter membranes excellent platforms for trace
detection of chemicals and water pollutants. In addition, the fabrication
process demonstrated here can be easily scaled up and large amounts
of contaminated water can be used for in field measurements.

Experimental
Section
PA filter membranes (NL16, PA), 47 mm diameter, 0.2
μm pore
sizes, were purchased from GE Healthcare Life Science (Whatman) for
performing the filter SERS assay. The following chemicals were used
as purchased: hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich), silver nitrate
(AgNO3, 99.9%, J. M. Vaz Pereira), trisodium citrate dihydrate
(Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich), CV (C25H30ClN3, Merck), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, wt 10 000, Sigma-Aldrich),
ethanol (C2H5OH, absolute anhydrous, Carlos
Erba) and N,N-dimetylformamide (DMF,
Carlos Erba), MB (C16H18N3SCl, Riedel-De
Haën), and R6G (C28H31N2O3Cl, Sigma-Aldrich).

Silver spherical NPs: The Ag colloids
were prepared by reduction
of aqueous AgNO3 with sodium citrate.32 An aqueous solution (400 mL) of AgNO3 (1 mM)
was boiled under reflux (90 °C). Then, a sodium citrate solution
(100 mg) was added dropwise to the boiling silver nitrate solution,
under vigorous stirring. The mixture was then refluxed for more 10
min and then cooled at room temperature.

Gold spherical NPs:
The Au colloid with 10 nm diameter was prepared
via reduction of a gold(III) salt with trisodium citrate as follows.33 An aqueous solution containing 10 mL trisodium
citrate (38.8 mM) was mixed with 100 mL of tetrachloroauric(III) acid
solution (1 mM) previously brought to a rolling boil under vigorous
stirring. The colloidal Au nanospheres were placed in a bottle, and
this was kept in the dark at a temperature of 5 °C. Gold NPs
with 30 nm were also prepared via reduction of a gold(III) salt with
trisodium citrate, using different amounts of HAuCl4 (200
mL, 0.3 mM) and sodium citrate (1.8 mL, 38.8 mM).34

Gold nanostars: The capping of the as-prepared Au
NPs with 10 nm
diameter was modified with PVP by the method elsewhere and then used
as seeds for nanostar growth.35 Nanostars
were prepared by adding PVP-coated gold seeds ([Au]: 9.29 × 10–4 M) in ethanol to a mixture of HAuCl4 (2.73
× 10–4 M) and PVP (monomer concentration: 10
mM) in DMF under rapid stirring at room temperature. Within 20 min,
the color of the solution changed from pink to blue, indicating the
formation of gold nanostars.36

To
perform the SERS filter membranes, we used two different methods:
in the first method, the PA filter membrane was placed into a filter
Millipore holder and then the plasmonic nanostructures were passed
through the filter membrane by filtration under reduced pressure.
In the case of Ag NPs, two filtering steps were used for distinct
amounts of colloids. For instance, for the same initial volume of
the Ag colloid added to the PA filter membrane, the Ag NPs were filtered
(under reduced pressure), using the following procedure: 1 ×
20, 2 × 10, and 4 × 5 mL. In a second approach, the total
volume of the Ag colloid employed was also varied. Thus, PA composites
were prepared by one-step filtration of the collods by using the following
volumes: 20, 10, 5, and 2 mL.

The membrane traps the NPs, forming
a SERS-active substrate. The
PA filter membranes loaded with NPs were then removed from the filter
Millipore and dried at room temperature. The filter assays were investigated
as SERS substrates for the detection of CV using different procedures:
preconcentration by filtration under reduced pressure method and drop/evaporation,
respectively. In the former, an aqueous solution of CV with 100 μM
concentration has been prepared and 10 mL of the solution was filtered
through the Ag/PA substrate. For the latter procedure, an aliquot
of the aqueous solution of CV (100 μM, 10 μL) was added
to the different metal/PA substrates and let to dry at room temperature.

In the last method, an aqueous solution of CV (10 mL, 100 μM)
was passed through the filter membrane contained in the filter Millipore
holder. After being dried at room temperature, the CV/PA filter membranes
were placed again in the filter holder and then the colloidal Ag NPs
(1 × 10 mL) were passed through the filter membrane. The composites
were dried at room temperature.

For the detection of CV in real
samples spiked with CV, a solution
of CV (0.1 mM) was prepared in Aveiro Estuary water (seawater) and
diluted from 100 μM to 100 aM, by sequential dilutions of a
factor of 100, followed by filtration under reduced pressure. For
the experiments with ultrapure water, aqueous solutions of CV with
varying concentrations (from 100 μM to 1 aM) have been also
prepared to establish the lower detection limit concentration. For
all SERS measurements, the pure PA filter membrane was also used as
the control sample. SERS measurements have been performed in different
areas of the nanocomposites to check the reproducibility of the measurements.

Raman images obtained using the WITec alpha300 RA+ were produced
by taking 150 × 150 Raman spectra in a uniform 40 × 40 μm
grid. A laser wavelength of 532 nm with a laser power of 15 μW
was used. A 100× objective was used to view samples, and the
integration time for each spectrum was 0.05 s. The times required
to create Raman images using each integration time were 22 min. The
plot for Raman intensity in relation to the CV concentration was generated
by monitoring the band at 1371 cm–1, assigned to
the N-phenyl stretching mode and at 1620 cm–1, assigned to the ring C–C stretching mode, using five different
samples for Aveiro Estuary water and three samples for ultrapure water
samples. Each point on the calibration curve represents the average
value of two identical Raman measurements for each sample with error
bars representing the standard deviation for each set of measurements.

A Jasco V 560 UV/visible (UV/vis) spectrophotometer was used for
recording the UV/vis spectra of the samples. TEM was carried out on
a Hitachi H-9000 TEM microscope operating at 300 kV. The TEM samples
were prepared by placing a drop of the diluted colloid on a carbon-coated
copper grid and the solvent was left to evaporate in air. SEM images
were obtained using a Hitachi SU-70 SEM. Raman spectral imaging and
AFM was performed in a combined Raman-AFM-SNOM confocal microscope
WITec alpha300 RAS+ at CICECO, in the Chemistry Department of the
University of Aveiro. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm was used.
Raman imaging experiments were performed by raster-scanning the laser
beam over the samples and accumulating a full Raman spectrum at each
pixel. Raman images were constructed by integrating over specific
Raman bands using WITec software for data evaluation and processing.
The average Raman spectra were obtained for the average of all data
taken to create the SERS images (22 500 spectra for each image).
AFM in tapping mode (AC-AFM) was carried out using a tip-cantilever
silicon reflex-coated with a spring constant of k = 42 N/m and 285 kHz of resonance frequency.
