The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) tests based
on the assumptions
of determined observations in the sample have been popularly applied
for the analysis of the data. The existing K–S tests for one
sample and two samples cannot be applied when the data contains neutrosophic
observations measured from the complex system or under uncertainty.
In this paper, we propose the generalization of the existing K–S
tests under the neutrosophic statistics. The proposed tests are known
as neutrosophic Kolmogorov–Smirnov (NK–S) tests. We
present the necessary measures and procedures to perform the proposed
tests. An example and advantages of the proposed NK–S tests
are given in the paper.

1 Introduction
The statistical methods/techniques
have been commonly used in all
fields for the analysis of the data, estimation, and forecasting purposes.
The data obtained from the system always follows some statistical
distribution, which is unknown in advance. Usually, it is assumed
that the data follows the normal distribution. However, in practice,
it is not always necessary that the data in hand follows the normal
distribution. Therefore, statisticians designed several tests to test
some hypotheses about the distribution of the data under investigation;
see ref (1). As mentioned
by Massey,1 “Attempts have been
made to find test statistics whose sampling distribution does not
depend upon either the explicit form of or the value of certain parameters
in, the distribution of the population. Such tests have been called
non-parametric or distribution-free tests.” The Kolmogorov–Smirnov
(K–S) test is an alternative non-parametric test, which uses
the cumulative distribution to decide about the specific distribution
of the data. The K–S test is found to be efficient for goodness
of fit purposes. Many authors worked on the K–S test; see,
for example, refs (1−8).

The K–S test under classical statistics is applied
when
all observations in the data are determined, precise, and sure. However,
in real situations, it may happen that the data cannot be represented
by statistical terms or the data may be in an interval or imprecise
data. For example, the ecology data, soil data, ocean data, and censored
data may be fuzzy data rather than exact data. Therefore, several
authors developed the K–S test for the analysis of fuzzy data;
see, for example, refs (9−16).

The fuzzy logic is a special case of neutrosophic logic.
The neutrosophic
logic is considered the measure of indeterminacy in addition to the
fuzzy logic; see ref (17). More
applications of the neutrosophic logic can be seen in refs (18−23). The neutrosophic statistics was developed by Smarandache24 using the neutrosophic logic. The neutrosophic
statistics is an extension of classical statistics, which considers
the measure of indeterminacy. The neutrosophic statistics is applied
when the observations in the data are neutrosophic numbers. Chen et
al.25,26 discussed the advantages of methods based
on neutrosophic numbers. Previous work27,28 introduced
several basic concepts for the neutrosophic statistics. Recently,
another previous work29 proposed the neutrosophic
ANOVA test.

The existing K–S test under classical statistics
and a fuzzy
approach cannot be applied when the measure of indeterminacy is needed.
By exploring the literature on classical statistics and the fuzzy
approach, we did not find any work on the K–S test under the
neutrosophic statistics. In this paper, we propose neutrosophic Kolmogorov–Smirnov
(NK–S) tests for a single sample and two samples. It is expected
that the proposed NK–S tests will effectively analyze the imprecise,
vague, and uncertain data compared to the existing K–S test
under classical statistics.

2 Results
For a radioactive source model,
radioactive engineering is interested
in testing the assumption that the count rate per second follows a
neutrosophic Poisson distribution. The count rate per second has the
neutrosophic mean [5,7] counts per second. To test the assumption,
radioactive engineering collected a large number of count data. The
neutrosophic Poisson distribution from ref (18) is given by  and  where Cu(XiN) is the neutrosophic commutative values, λNϵ[5,7] and nNϵ[78,92].

The neutrosophic count
data and neutrosophic statistics are shown
in Table 1. Suppose
the level of significance for this test is 0.01. The critical neutrosophic
value from ref (32) is . According to eq 4, the statistic in the indeterminacy interval
can be written as 0.1594 + 0.4032I; INϵ[0,0.6046]. The neutrosophic statistic from Table 1 is DNϵ[0.4032,0.1594]. Note here that the lower value of the indeterminacy
interval denotes the determined part. By comparing the values of DN with D0.01,14,
we note that the determinate part follows the Poisson distribution,
but the indeterminate part of the data does not follow the Poisson
distribution.

3 Discussion
In this section, we compare
the performance of the proposed NK–S
test over the K–S test under classical statistics. According
to refs (25) and (26), a method that provides
the results in the indeterminacy interval when the data have the neutrosophic
numbers is said to be more adequate and effective than the method
that provides the results in the determined form. To compare the proposed
NK–S test with the existing NK test, we will use the same data
that are given in Table 1. Note here that the data given in Table 1 reduces to the determined part under classical
statistics if no observations of uncertainty are recorded. For example,
for sample 1, the first value, which is 1, represents the indeterminate
part of the indeterminacy interval. The second value of this sample
represents the determinate part of the interval. From Table 1, we note that the proposed
test provides the results in the indeterminacy interval rather than
the determined values. Using eq 4, the values of the statistic in the indeterminacy form can
be written as 0.1594 + 0.4032I; INϵ[0,0.6046].
Note here that the proposed test provides a good measure of indeterminacy.
At a level of significance 0.01, the probability that the null hypothesis
will be accepted is 0.99, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis
when it is true is 0.01, and the probability of indeterminacy is 0.60.
For example, in the statistic DNϵ[0.4032,0.1594],
the value DL = 0.1594 presents the determined
part under the classical statistics, and the value DU = 0.4032 shows the indeterminate part under the uncertainty.
By comparing both tests, we note that DL < 0.1845, which shows that the existing NK test indicates that
the sample belongs to the Poisson distribution. However, the indeterminate
part shows that under uncertainty, the sample does not come from the
Poisson distribution. From this comparison, we conclude that the values
of the statistic DN can be from 0.1594
to 0.4032 under uncertainty. Hence, the theory of the proposed NK–S
test concurs with the theories of refs (25) and (26).

4 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we
presented the modifications of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
(K–S) test under the neutrosophic statistics. We proposed the
neutrosophic Kolmogorov–Smirnov (NK–S) tests, which
are the generalization of the K–S tests. The proposed NK–S
test under the neutrosophic statistical interval method is more adequate,
informative, and effective to be applied when the data have neutrosophic
numbers. The proposed test provides the results in the indeterminacy
interval, which is desirable under uncertainty or when the data is
measured from the complex system. We presented an example and found
that the proposed test is better than the existing K–S test.
We recommend applying the proposed NK–S tests for the analysis
of the data in biomedical sciences, big data analysis, engineering,
and statistics. More properties using the simulation data and/or the
development of software for the analysis of the proposed NK–S
tests can be considered for future research.

5 Computational Methods
Assume that XN = aN + bNIN be a neutrosophic
number (NN) where aN is the determinate
part and bNIN; INϵ[IL, IU] is the indeterminate part of the NN. Let XN = X + INX; XNϵ[XL, XU] be a random variable based on the
NN where XL and XU are lower and upper values of the indeterminacy interval.
Note here that the NN and XNϵ[XL, XU] reduce to
a number and a variable under classical statistics if IL = 0 or XL = XU, respectively. The neutrosophic variable XNϵ[XL, XU] presented the NNs in a sample selected from the population
having imprecise, uncertain, and indeterminate values or parameters.
More details about neutrosophic statistics can be seen in ref (17). The main aim is to propose
the K–S tests under the neutrosophic statistics to determine
the specific distribution of the data in the presence of neutrosophy.

5.1 Neutrosophic Kolmogorov–Smirnov Tests
The Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test was originally
derived by Kolmogorov30 and Smirnov31 and has been used in nonparametric testing of
the hypothesis. In classical statistics, the K–S test has been
commonly used to test whether the sample under study belongs to a
specific distribution or not. In other words, the K–S test
is applied to decide whether the observed distribution significantly
differs from the specified population distribution.32 The existing K–S test is applied under the assumption
that all observations/parameters in the observed sample and in the
population are determined and precise. The data that came from complex
systems such as the ocean, the human brain data, and power grid or
under uncertainty may not have all determined observations. In these
situations, the K–S test under classical statistics cannot
be applied for testing whether the data belong to a specific distribution.
We modify the existing K–S test under classical statistics
using the neutrosophic statistics. The proposed neutrosophic Kolmogorov–Smirnov
(NK–S) test is the generalization of the existing K–S
test proposed by Kolmogorov30 and Smirnov.31 The proposed NK–S test will be applicable
under the following assumptions:1. The data consists of uncertain, imprecise,
and indeterminate values.

2. The two neutrosophic samples should
be mutually independent.



The K–S test can be applied independent of the
cumulative distribution function. Woodruff et al.33 used it for the Weibull distribution. Papadopolous and
Qiao34 and Frey35 presented the K–S test for the Poisson distribution.

Suppose that X1N, X2N, ..., XnN be a neutrosophic random sample from a neutrosophic population
having a neutrosophic cumulative frequency distribution function,
say F0N(xn). By following ref (1), the null hypothesis that the neutrosophic sample
came from the specified neutrosophic distribution is rejected if the
neutrosophic cumulative frequency distribution function is not close
to the specified neutrosophic distribution function. Suppose now that F0N(xn); F0N(xnN)ϵ[F0L(xnL), F0N(xnU)] and SnN(xnN); SnN(xnN)ϵ[SnL(xnL), SnU(xnU)] be the neutrosophic population cumulative distribution
function and the observed neutrosophic sample distribution function,
respectively. Then, the neutrosophic maximum difference statistic
based on F0N(xn); F0N(xnN)ϵ[F0L(xnL), F0N(xnU)] and SnN(xnN)ϵ[SnL(xnL), SnU(xnU)] is given by 1  

The proposed test in
the indeterminacy interval can be written
as 2  Note here that AN and BNIN are
the determined and indeterminate parts of the test. The proposed test
reduces to the tests in refs (30) and (31) if no indeterminacy is found in the data. Also, note here that the
proposed NK–S test reduces to the tests in refs (30) and (31) when DL = DU. The neutrosophic null
hypothesis that the sample came from the neutrosophic specified population
is accepted if DNϵ[DL, DU] > DαN where DαNϵ[DαL, DαU] is a neutrosophic critical
value and can be selected from ref (32).

5.2 NK–S Test for Comparing Two Populations
Kolmogorov30 and Smirnov31 also extended the K–S test for comparing
two populations. Like the K–S test for a single population,
this test is also based on the assumption that the observations/parameters
of two populations should be determined and precise. In this section,
we present the NK–S test for comparing two neutrosophic populations.
Let X1N, X2N, ..., Xn1N and Y1N, Y2N, ..., Yn2N be two neutrosophic independent samples of
sizes n1Nϵ[n1L, n1U] and n2Nϵ[n1L, n1U] from a specified
population, respectively. Let Sn1N(xn1N)ϵ[SnL(xn1L), SnU(xn1U)] and Sn2N(yn2N)ϵ[SnL(yn2L), SnU(yn2U)] be neutrosophic sample cumulative distribution functions. Then,
the neutrosophic maximum difference statistic based on Sn1N(xn1N)ϵ[SnL(xn1L), SnU(xn1U)] and Sn2N(yn2N)ϵ[SnL(yn2L), SnU(yn2U)] is
given by 3  

The proposed test for
two populations in the form of indeterminacy can be written as 4  Note here that CN and ENIN are
the determined and indeterminate parts of the test. The proposed test
reduces to the tests in refs (30) and (31) if no indeterminacy is found in the data. Note also here that the
proposed NK–S test reduces to the tests in refs (30) and (31) when SnL(xn1L) = SnU(xn1U) and SnL(yn2L) = SnU(yn2U). The neutrosophic null hypothesis that two samples came from the
same neutrosophic specified population is accepted if DNϵ[DL, DU] > DαN where DαNϵ[DαL, DαU] is a neutrosophic critical value.
