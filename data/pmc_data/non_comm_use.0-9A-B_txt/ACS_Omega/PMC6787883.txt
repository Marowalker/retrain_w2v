It has been a challenge to achieve
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
metallization and mass production with a high quality. The main aim
of this study was to develop a large-scale production method of metal-ion-coated
DNA hybrid fibers, which can be useful for the development of physical
devices and sensors. Cetyltrimethylammonium-chloride-modified DNA
molecules (CDNA) coated with metal ions through self-metallization
exhibit enhanced optical and magnetic properties and thermal stability.
In this paper, we present a simple synthesis route for Cu2+-coated CDNA hybrid fibers through ion exchange followed by self-metallization
and analyze their structural and chemical composition (by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), high-resolution field emission transmission electron microscopy
(FETEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)) and optical
(by ultraviolet (UV)–visible absorption, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS)), magnetic
(by vibrating-sample magnetometry), and thermal (by a thermogravimetric
analysis) characteristics. The XRD patterns, high-resolution FETEM
images, and selected-area electron diffraction patterns confirmed
the triclinic structure of Cu2+ in CDNA. The EDS results
revealed the formation of Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with
a homogeneous distribution of Cu2+. The UV–vis,
FTIR, and XPS spectra showed the electronic transition, interaction,
and energy transfer between CDNA and Cu2+, respectively.
The Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers exhibited a ferromagnetic nature
owing to the presence of Cu2+. The magnetization of the
Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers increased with the concentration
of Cu2+ and decreased with the increase in temperature.
Endothermic (absorbed heat) and exothermic (released heat) peaks in
the differential thermal analysis curve were observed owing to the
interaction of Cu2+ with the phosphate backbone.

1 Introduction
The development of flexible
fibers with hybrid nanostructures consisting
of organic and inorganic components is important for various applications
in physical, chemical, and biological sciences, as well as materials
engineering. The selection of organic and inorganic components is
crucial to fabricate the hybrid nanostructures and utilize them for
the development of novel devices and sensors. The main aim of this
study was to develop a large-scale production method of unique hybrid
nanostructures, which can be useful for the development of spintronic
and optoelectronic devices and sensors. Naturally available biomolecules
might be useful to replace the conventional inferior materials in
various applications in both physical and biological sciences.1−3 Among the various biomolecules, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules
are promising owing to their intrinsic physical properties such as
absorption at a specific target wavelength, transparency in the visible-light
range, and biodegradable and flexible structure with efficient scaffold
characteristics for the alignment of functional nanomaterials.4−8 DNA molecules modified with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium
chloride (CDNA) through an ion-exchange process can be dissolved in
organic solvents and thus are intensively studied owing to the increased
applicability of organic materials in target solvents.

Among
the various nanomaterials such as ions, nanoparticles, carbon-based
materials, and proteins, metal ions (e.g., Cu2+) exhibit
promising electrical, optical, and magnetic characteristics, which
can be helpful in enhancing the DNA characteristics. Although thin
films of metal-doped and lanthanide-ion-doped DNA duplexes have been
fabricated, hybrid fibers of CDNA metallized with ions synthesized
in a large-scale production in a powder form have been rarely discussed.9−15 Metal (e.g., Ag, Au, and Pd)-coated DNA nanowires fabricated by
chemically derivatized and seeding growth methods were reported; however,
the DNA metallization method was complex and the mass production of
samples with a high quality was quite limited.16−19 CDNA fibers metallized with Cu2+ are formed as core (CDNA)–shell (Cu2+)
structures by self-metallization, which can easily alter the electrical,
optical, and magnetic characteristics of the samples.

In this
study, we developed a novel simple methodology to synthesize
CDNA fibers metallized with Cu2+. The simple fabrication
methodology is advantageous for the mass production of Cu2+-coated CDNA hybrid fibers by ion-exchange and self-metallization
processes. The synthesized Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers were
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution field-emission
transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze their crystal structures and chemical
compositions with elemental mapping. In addition, ultraviolet (UV)–vis
spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating-sample magnetometry (VSM),
and thermal analysis were carried out to evaluate the absorption characteristics,
chemical interactions, spin states and chemical bondings, magnetic
properties, and thermal properties of the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers, respectively.

2 Experimental Methods
First, 3 g of DNA obtained by an enzyme isolation process (Marine
Salmon P/No. DPO 1405787, GEM Corporation, Shiga, Japan) is dissolved
in 1000 mL of deionized (DI) water followed by magnetic stirring (1000
rpm for 24 h at room temperature). Subsequently, 6 mL of cetyltrimethylammonium-chloride
(Sigma-Aldrich, Seoul, Korea) is diluted in 1000 mL of DI water in
another beaker followed by magnetic stirring. The diluted cetyltrimethylammonium-chloride
solution is then slowly added into the DNA solution while stirring
to achieve a homogeneous mixture of DNA and cetyltrimethylammonium-chloride.
This process enables the attachment of the CTMA surfactant onto the
surface of the DNA phosphate backbone through ion exchange, yielding
a white precipitate of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride modified DNA
(CDNA). The precipitate is further stirred for 5 h followed by filtering
and washing with excess amount of DI water to remove the residues
of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride and NaCl. Finally, white CDNA fibers
are obtained by drying for 2 days at a temperature of 40 °C.

For the CDNA solution, 0.5 g of CDNA fibers is dissolved in 50
mL of methanol, followed by magnetic stirring at 1000 rpm for 24 h
at room temperature to obtain the final solution with 1 wt % of CDNA.
To prepare a copper-ion (Cu2+) solution (1 M), appropriate
quantity of copper nitrate [Cu(NO3)2] powder
(Sigma Aldrich, Seoul, Korea) is dissolved in methanol by vortexing.
For the Cu2+-coated CDNA (denoted as Cu-CDNA), proper amounts
of Cu2+ solution (0, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 mM) are slowly
added dropwise into the CDNA solution while stirring. Consequently,
the Cu2+ ions are attached onto the surface of the CDNA
phosphate backbone through self-metallization. The solution containing
the fibers is further stirred for 3 h, followed by incubation at 50
°C for 2 days for drying, yielding the Cu-CDNA fibers.

A high-power powder XRD (D8 Advance, Bruker, MA) is used to analyze
the structural characteristics of the Cu-CDNA fibers. High-resolution
FETEM (JEM-2100F, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200 kV is used for
imaging and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of the Cu-CDNA
fibers. The state-of-the-art EDS (Oxford Instruments 80 TLE detector
system, Abingdon, U.K.) equipped with the FETEM enabled an efficient
and fast elemental mapping of the Cu-CDNA fibers at the nanoscale.
A UV–vis–near-infrared spectrophotometer (V-670, JASCO,
Tokyo, Japan) is employed to analyze the optical absorption of the
Cu-CDNA fibers in the wavelength range of 200–900 nm. A FTIR
spectrometer (TENSOR 27, Detector: MIR-ATR (ZnSe), Bruker Inc., MA)
is employed to analyze the chemical interaction between Cu2+ and CDNA fibers in the wavenumber range of 600–3700 cm–1. XPS (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Scientific, Winsford,
U.K.) is used to analyze the spin state, composition, and charge transfer
associated with the binding energy of the Cu-CDNA fibers. The XPS
spectrum is acquired using an Al Kα X-ray source
in the binding energy range up to 1350 eV.

VSM (PPMS-9, Quantum
Design, CA) is used to analyze the magnetic
characteristics, i.e., the magnetic field (H)-dependent
magnetization (M) and temperature (T)-dependent M of the Cu-CDNA fibers. Thermal analyses
(TG/DTA7300 Seiko Instruments, Chiba, Japan) including a thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential
thermal analysis (DTA) are carried out to characterize the thermal
properties of the Cu-CDNA fibers.

3 Results
and Discussion
Schematics and photographs of the DNA fibers,
CDNA fibers prepared
through the ion-exchange process, and Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers prepared through self-metallization are shown in Figure 1. During the self-metallization,
the positively charged Cu2+ ions were coordinated on the
CDNA phosphate backbone group through the electrostatic interaction
followed by formation of a polycrystalline structure. Finally, CDNA
fibers metallized with Cu2+ were formed as core–shell
structures. The synthesis of the CDNA fibers metallized with Cu2+ was explained in detail in experimental methods.

through the ion-exchange process, and (c) Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers obtained through self-metallization.

XRD was carried out to analyze the characteristic crystal structure
of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers (Figure 2a). The diffraction pattern of the pristine
CDNA fibers showed a broad peak at 2θ of 20°. The characteristic
diffraction peaks of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers at 2θ
of 16.5, 19.4, 20.6, 21.8, 22.7, 23.8, 24.9, and 25.6° corresponded
to the (021), (221̅), (220), (13̅0), (222̅), (022̅),
(11̅2), and (221) planes, respectively, which mostly matched
with those of the triclinic copper phosphate (Joint Committee on Powder
Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) card no. 52–1346). The triclinic
phase of copper phosphate was an indirect evidence of the Cu2+ binding on the DNA phosphate backbone. The diffraction peak intensity
increased with [Cu2+] on CDNA owing to the increased relative
amount of Cu2+ on the CDNA fiber.

Figure 2b–d
shows the typical high-resolution FETEM images and SAED pattern of
the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers having 10 mM of Cu2+ (denoted as Cu (10)-CDNA) to verify the crystalline structure of
the sample. Relatively thinner and thicker CDNA bundles coated with
Cu2+ (inset) are observed in Figure 2b. The magnified FETEM image shows the highly
crystalline structure of the sample with an interplanar lattice spacing
of 0.39 nm, which corresponds to the (222̅) planes of copper
phosphate in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers. The copper phosphate
was well-crystallized on the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers, which
provides a direct evidence of the Cu2+ binding on CDNA.
The SAED pattern shows the polycrystalline structure of the sample
(Figure 2d), which
could be indexed to the reflection of the triclinic copper phosphate,
consistent with the above XRD results. The chemical composition of
the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers was determined by the EDS technique,
as shown in Figure 2e–j. The EDS spectrum confirmed the presence of the core elements
of O, P, N, and C as well as Cu in the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers. To analyze the distributions of the elements, EDS elemental
mapping was performed (Figure 2f–j). In the elemental maps, O, P, N, C, and Cu elements
in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers are presented in yellow,
pink, blue, green, and red, respectively, which demonstrate the uniform
distributions of the elements throughout the Cu2+-coated
CDNA fiber.

To understand the interaction between CDNA and Cu2+,
UV–vis absorption spectra of the Cu2+-coated CDNA
powders with various [Cu2+] were acquired (Figure 3a). The characteristic absorption
peaks of the pristine CDNA were in the UV region attributed to the
electronic transitions between occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals.20−22 Upon the addition of Cu2+, the characteristic absorption
peak of Cu2+ in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers
was observed at around 730 nm. The Cu2+ characteristic
peak intensity increased and the peak shifted toward larger wavelengths
upon the increase in [Cu2+], which might be attributed
to the d–d electronic transition and surface plasmon resonance
generated by Cu2+ in the sample.23 The characteristic absorption peak position shift of Cu2+ and the band edge shift of CDNA in the Cu2+-coated CDNA
as a function of [Cu2+] are presented in Figure 3b. The inset in Figure 3b shows the intensity variation
of the Cu2+ characteristic peak as a function of [Cu2+] in the sample. The Cu2+ absorption peak position
exhibited a red-shift from 732 to 792 nm with the increase in [Cu2+] from 5 to 15 mM. Similarly, with the increase in [Cu2+] from 0 to 15 mM, the band edge attributed to the shift
in the CDNA from 384 to 539 nm. This implies that the optical band
gap of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers decreased upon the addition
of Cu2+ by a factor up to ∼1.4.

fibers. (a) Absorption spectra of the
CDNA fibers coated with various [Cu2+]. (b) Shifts in the

the presence of Cu2+ in CDNA. (d) Characteristic FTIR peak
intensities of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers at fixed wavenumbers
(1060 and 1335 cm–1) as a function of [Cu2+].

The FTIR spectra of the CDNA fibers
coated with Cu2+ were measured to demonstrate the characteristic
peaks of CDNA and
Cu2+ (Figure 3c). The characteristic absorbance bands of the CDNA fibers in the
spectral range of 600–3700 cm–1 can be categorized
into four regions.24,25 Region 1 (700–1350 cm–1) involves the sugar puckering mode, phosphodiester
backbone, and deoxyribose. Region 2 (1350–1750 cm–1) consisted of bands sensitive to the base pairing and stacking interaction.
Region 3 (2850–2950 cm–1) included the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching modes of CH2 owing to the modification
of DNA with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride. Region 4 (3100–3500
cm–1) included the water molecular vibrations. It
is worth noting that the characteristic FTIR absorbance peak of Cu2+ at ∼1335 cm–1 was observed in the
spectra of Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers. This peak corresponded
to Cu–O–P; its intensity was proportional to [Cu2+].

To evaluate the influences of CDNA and Cu2+ in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers at specific wavenumbers,
we analyzed
the FTIR characteristic peaks of deoxyribose in CDNA and Cu2+ at 1060 and 1335 cm–1, respectively. Figure 3d shows the variations
in the peak intensities as a function of [Cu2+] at the
fixed wavenumbers of 1060 and 1335 cm–1, associated
with the C–O deoxyribose stretching mode and Cu–O–P,
respectively. The absorbance peak intensity at 1060 cm–1 gradually decreased with the increase in [Cu2+] owing
to the reduction in the relative amount of CDNA upon the addition
of Cu2+. In contrast, the peak intensity of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers at 1335 cm–1 increased
with [Cu2+] owing to the electrostatic interaction between
the phosphate backbone in CDNA and Cu2+.

We carried
out XPS to analyze the chemical compositions and oxidation
states by the photon energy, which was used to probe the chemical
binding energies of the samples. The XPS spectra of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with 7 and 15 mM of Cu2+ are shown
in Figure 4. The overview
XPS survey spectra showed the elemental characteristic peaks of C,
O, N, P, and Cu. They were consistent with the EDS data, which confirmed
the existence of the core elements in the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers. The peaks at binding energies of 284.8, 531.8, 406.2, 133.4,
and 934.7 eV were attributed to the C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, P 2p, and Cu
2p orbitals, respectively, which confirmed the anchoring of Cu2+ on the CDNA fibers.26−29Figure 4b–d shows the changes in atomic weight, full width at half-maximum
(FWHM) values, and the binding energy shifts of the core elements
in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with varying [Cu2+]. The concentration of C was higher at a lower [Cu2+]
coated on the CDNA fibers, while the concentrations of O, N, P, and
Cu increased with [Cu2+] on the CDNA fibers. However, the
changes in the FWHM values of the C and N elements were negligible,
while significant changes in the FWHM values of the O and P elements
were observed. These results suggested the Cu2+ coating
onto the phosphate backbone in CDNA through self-metallization. The
small changes in the binding energies of the core elements between
Cu (15)-CDNA and Cu (7)-CDNA (Figure 4d) were attributed to the charge transfer between CDNA
and Cu2+.

CDNA.

High-resolution XPS spectra with
deconvoluted curves of C 1s, O
1s, N 1s, P 2p, and Cu 2p for the Cu2+-coated CDNA hybrid
fibers are shown in Figure 4e–i, respectively. The deconvolution of the C 1s peak
in the XPS spectrum showed two types of carbon bonds, C–C/C–H
(at 284.8 eV) and C–O/C–N (at 286 eV). The deconvolution
of the O 1s peak showed one type of oxygen bond (C=O/P=O
(531.9 eV)) for Cu (7)-CDNA and two types of oxygen bond (C=O/P=O
(531.9 eV) and C–C–P/C–C–C (533.1 eV))
for Cu (15)-CDNA. The N 1s peak after the deconvolution corresponded
to three types of nitrogen bonds (C–NH2/C=N–C/N=C
(399.5 eV), N–C (402.3 eV), and N–H (406.2)). The P
2p peak after the deconvolution corresponded to one type of phosphorus
bond (P 2p3/2 (133.5 eV)) for Cu (7)-CDNA and two types
of phosphorus bonds (P 2p3/2 (133.2 eV) and P–O
(134.1 eV)) for Cu (15)-CDNA. The high-resolution Cu 2p XPS spectra
of both Cu (7)-CDNA and Cu (15)-CDNA included peaks around 935.1 and
954.4 eV, which corresponded to Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, respectively. These results confirmed the presence of
Cu2+ on CDNA in the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers.
Additionally, for Cu (15)-CDNA, shake-up satellite peaks of Cu 2p
at 941.6, 944.9, and 951.6 eV were observed. The satellite peaks at
a higher [Cu2+] are well-known characteristics of Cu 2p.30

Remarkable changes in the O 1s and P 2p
XPS spectrum peaks with
[Cu2+] were observed, which revealed the additional deconvoluted
peaks of Cu (15)-CDNA compared to Cu (7)-CDNA. The blue shift of the
binding energies of O 1s and P 2p for the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers (compared to the pristine CDNA) indirectly confirmed the formation
of O···Cu and Cu–O–P bonds (oxygen-containing
molecules prefer to coordinate metal ions). These results suggested
that the Cu2+ ions interacted with CDNA as the phosphate
backbone in CDNA contained P and O in the form of PO2–.

The magnetic characteristics of the Cu2+-coated CDNA
hybrid fibers, including the magnetization (M) and
susceptibility (χ), were analyzed using VSM (Figures 5 and 6). The M values of the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers with varied [Cu2+] as a function of applied magnetic
field (H) in the range of −20 to +20 kOe were
recorded at 300 K (Figure 5a). The pristine CDNA fibers exhibited the inherent diamagnetic
characteristic reflected in the ratio of M and H (i.e., χ = M/H) in the M–H curve (which
shows a negative slope (−χ)). In contrast, the CDNA fibers
with Cu2+ exhibited an increased M, corresponding
to a ferromagnetic behavior with smaller coercive field (Hc) and remanent magnetization (Mr). The Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers exhibited the saturation
magnetization (Ms) up to 10 mM of Cu2+, owing to the spin alignment of Cu2+ in CDNA
at a relatively high applied H. Above 10 mM of Cu2+, the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers did not exhibit Ms even at a higher applied H owing to the excess Cu2+ at a given [CDNA], which led
to noncollinear spin alignment and canted spins of Cu2+.31 The inset in Figure 5a shows the average χ of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers as a function of [Cu2+], which
revealed the negative and positive χ values of the pristine
CDNA and Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers, respectively.

fibers. (a) M–T curves of
the CDNA fibers with Cu2+ measured

χ and χ–1 of the pristine CDNA fibers
as a function of T. (b–d) χ–T and χ–1–T curves
for the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with various [Cu2+].

Figure 5b,c shows
the M–H curves of the pristine
CDNA and Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers, respectively, with 15
mM of Cu2+ (Cu (15)-CDNA) measured at three different temperatures
(T) of 5, 100, and 300 K. The pristine CDNA fibers
at 100 and 5 K exhibited diamagnetic and ferromagnetic behaviors,
respectively, whereas Cu (15)-CDNA at 100 and 5 K exhibited a strong
ferromagnetism. M of Cu (15)-CDNA (pristine CDNA)
was increased from 0.02 to 1.5 emu/g (from −0.01 to 0.04 emu/g)
at a fixed applied H of 20 kOe upon the decrease
in T from 300 to 5 K. At 5 K, the spins were easily
aligned by the external applied H, leading to a higher M than that at the high T.

Figure 5d–f
shows the χ values of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers
with various [Cu2+] as a function of applied H at 300 K and changes in χ of the CDNA fibers without and with
15 mM Cu2+ measured at 5, 100, and 300 K. χ gradually
decreased with the increase in the applied H and
increased with the decrease in T. The change in χ
between the pristine CDNA and Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers was
significant owing to the presence of Cu2+, which strongly
influenced M of the sample through the applied H. The values of χ (negative for the diamagnetic behavior
of the pristine CDNA and positive for either para- or ferromagnetic
behavior of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers) provided valuable
information on the magnetic characteristics of the samples. Owing
to the ferromagnetic characteristic and feasibility for mass production,
the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers could be used in memory devices
and flexible magnets.

In addition, we studied the T-dependent magnetic
characteristics (M, χ, and χ–1) of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers at a constant applied H of 1000 Oe and used them to estimate the Curie temperature
(TC) (Figure 6). The M values of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with [Cu2+] of 0, 5, 10, and
15 mM measured in the T range of 2–300 K are
shown in Figure 6a.
For the CDNA fibers with Cu2+, we observed a significant
increase in M particularly at a low T (≤30 K). We observed nonzero M of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers up to 300 K, which suggested that no
magnetic transition occurred in the measured T range.
This implies that TC of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers was above 300 K. For practical application, ferromagnetic
materials having TC higher than 300 K
(e.g., Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers) are useful to prevent thermal
damage.

Figure 6b–d
shows the χ–T and χ–1–T curves of the Cu2+-coated CDNA
fibers with various [Cu2+]. Although the M–H curve of the pristine CDNA fibers reveals
a negative χ, which indicates a diamagnetic behavior of the
sample (Figure 5a),
the nonzero M with a positive χ for the pristine
CDNA fibers suggested a weak ferromagnetism at a low applied H of 1000 Oe (inset in Figure 6a). The [Cu2+]-dependent χ
of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers exhibited a gradual increase
with [Cu2+] in CDNA. The values of χ–1 were used to differentiate the magnetic structure. For the paramagnetic
structure, the slope (=Δχ–1/ΔT) was roughly constant in the entire T range, while for the ferromagnetic structure, the slope was significant
at a low T. Consequently, the Cu2+-coated
CDNA fibers were ferromagnetic as a large slope change was observed
at a low T compared to that at a high T.

The thermal stabilities of the pristine CDNA and Cu (15)-CDNA
fibers
were analyzed by a TGA through the weight loss and DTG and DTA through
heat flow. The T-dependent weights (W), derivative weights (−ΔW/ΔT), and heat flows of the fibers at a heating rate of 10
°C/min in the range of 30–600 °C under nitrogen atmosphere
are shown in Figure 7. The weights slowly decreased with the increase in T up to 220 °C; weight losses (−ΔW) of 11% for the pristine CDNA and 19% for the Cu (15)-CDNA fibers
were observed at 220 °C. These weight losses were attributed
to the volatilization of water molecules from the DNA.32 In the T range of 220–325
°C, the weights of the pristine CDNA and Cu (15)-CDNA fibers
rapidly decreased to 35 and 38%, respectively (at 325 °C) owing
to the degradation of the DNA backbone. Finally, the weights reached
24% for the pristine CDNA and 28% for the Cu (15)-CDNA fibers at the
relatively high T of 600 °C owing to the decomposition
of molecules. Owing to the Cu2+ coating around CDNA, a
smaller weight loss than that of the pristine CDNA was observed at
a high T. Figure 7b shows the DTG curves obtained using the slope (−ΔW/ΔT) in the TG curve during the
heating of the samples. Significant peaks are observed around 265
°C for both pristine CDNA and Cu (15)-CDNA fibers. This indicated
that the weight was severely influenced up to a certain critical T (i.e., 265 °C).

(a–c) TGA, DTG, and DTA curves of the Cu2+-coated
CDNA fibers measured in the T range of 30–600
°C, respectively.

The heat flows of the
samples as a function of T (DTA curve) exhibited
local minima and local maxima related to the
endothermic (absorbed heat) and exothermic (released heat) reactions
(Figure 7c), respectively.
We observed endothermic peaks at 207, 260, and 308 °C and exothermic
peaks at 225 and 290 °C for the pristine CDNA fibers. Similarly,
the Cu (15)-CDNA fibers exhibited endothermic peaks at 95, 193, and
278 °C and exothermic peaks at 181 and 215 °C. Considerable
endothermic and exothermic peaks of the Cu (15)-CDNA fibers were observed
owing to the interaction between Cu2+ and CDNA fibers,
which helps prevent thermal damage up to a certain T; hence, the thermal stability is increased with the Cu2+ coating.

4 Conclusions
Ferromagnetic Cu2+-coated CDNA hybrid fibers were synthesized
by ion-exchange and self-metallization processes. The fibers exhibited
a polycrystalline triclinic crystal structure of copper phosphate,
uniform distribution of elements, surface plasmon resonance effect
in the visible region, preferential interaction of Cu2+ with DNA, O···Cu and Cu–O–P bondings
confirmed by the blue shifts of O 1s and P 2p, ferromagnetism even
at room temperature, and thermally stable characteristics. The core–shell
structure of the Cu2+-coated CDNA fibers with enhanced
structural, optical, magnetic, and thermal properties is feasible
for use in various applications such as flexible magnets, memory storage,
electromagnetic shielding, and optoelectronics in the future.
