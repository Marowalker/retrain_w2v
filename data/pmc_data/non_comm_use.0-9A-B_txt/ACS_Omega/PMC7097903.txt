We developed a novel, simple, sensitive, accurate, and precise
method for the determination of calcitonin in different serum samples
with medullar thyroid carcinoma. The designed flower-like thin film
gold nanoparticles doped in a sol–gel/polyethylene glycol mold
are used as an optical biosensor for the efficient determination of
calcitonin. The sensor was characterized by transmission electron
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive
X-ray microanalysis, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.
The efficiency of the considered bio-sensor is done using the quencher
calcitonin of the emission band at 360 nm of biomarker obtained at
λex = 333 nm in acetonitrile solvent. The sensing
mechanism was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The
remarkable quenching of the fluorescence intensity at 360 nm of optical
sensor by various concentrations of calcitonin was successfully used
as an optical biosensor for the assessment of calcitonin for different
serum samples of patients with medullar thyroid carcinoma. The calibration
plot was prepared for the concentration range 0.01–1000 pg/mL
of calcitonin with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and a detection
limit of 0.707 pg/mL. The suggested method augments the sensitivity
of calcitonin as a useful biomarker for the early diagnosis of medullar
thyroid carcinoma. This method is considered as a gateway for the
construction of a new prototype for the follow-up of thyroid cancer
in the spinal cord during and after treatment.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The calcitonin (thyrocalcitonin) protein is a hormone present in
humans and other mammals. This protein is secreted by parafollicular
cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland. It consists of 32 amino acids,
as shown in Figure S1.1 Calcitonin withdraws calcium from the blood when the calcium
concentration increases above the normal range. This occurs in different
ways, such as (1) by reducing the activity of osteoclasts in bone
tissues, thus preventing the desorption (breakdown) of bones. (2)
By inhibiting the re-absorption of calcium by kidney cells, which
in turn increases calcium secretion in urine.2 An additional function of calcitonin is the reduction of the concentration
of phosphorus in the blood when its level exceeds the normal value.
Calcitonin is an excellent biomarker for medullar thyroid carcinoma
(MTC).3−6 The normal range of calcitonin is less than 18.2 pg/mL in males
and 11.5 pg/mL in females.7 Many methods
are used to assess human serum calcitonin, such as radioimmunoassay,8 time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay,9 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),10 two-site immunofluorometry,11 high performance liquid chromatography,12 room-temperature phosphorescence immunoassay,13 immunocytochemistry for calcitonin (ICC-calcitonin),14 and electrochemical technique.15 However, these methods have some disadvantages, such as
the radioactive material contamination in radioimmunoassay is harmful
to human health cell. Other immunoassay techniques necessitate a long
time for analysis. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are a good biosensor
for the early diagnosis of diseases because of their distinct physical
and chemical properties.16 Accordingly,
Au NPs can be used as a sensor according to different measured phenomena,
such as electrochemical response,17 photofluorescence,18−21 UV–vis absorption,22 and Raman
scattering.23 The interactions between
Au NPs and some biomolecules are always very effective and specific.24,25 Therefore, a highly selective and sensitive assessment method was
obtained. Recently, we used them as a novel tool for the detection
of pathogens26 and unamplified Aeromonas hydrophila DNA.27 We have witnessed the use of many sensitive NPs for cancer therapy.28 In this work, the optical biosensor gold nanoflowers
[AuNFs] doped in a sol–gel/polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix
draws our attention toward the sensitive determination of calcitonin
medullar thyroid cancer biomarker in human serum because of its high
sensitivity, simplicity, low cost, being relatively free from interference
with coexisting substances, and relatively short analysis time than
other methods. Using multi-branched NPs as an optical biosensor like
AuNFs has more advantages in contrast to spherical NPs, such as strong
plasmon resonances from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) regions
which open the window to various biological applications. The roughened
surface of the AuNFs increases the total surface area of the particle;
therefore, the number of molecules that are able to attach to its
surface have been increased. This property is used in surface-sensitive
applications such as catalysis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) because of its possible high-index facets. We have developed
a three-dimensional (3D) AuNF film with high yield and good size monodispersity
in the presence of a HEPES agent. The 3D AuNF film was used to detect
calcitonin by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the nano-biosensor
with various calcitonin concentrations in acetonitrile.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Absorption Spectra
Figure 1a shows the UV–vis absorption
spectrum of a AuNF colloidal solution in acetonitrile at 296 K. The
observed spectrum has three absorption peaks in the ultraviolet, visible,
and NIR regions. The first characteristic peak at 330 nm in the UV
region represents the 5d–6sp transition, which is called the
interband transition29 that results from
the absorption of higher energy photons. This phenomenon took place
in gold because the outermost orbitals d and s might have hybridized
together to form six energy levels, five of which are flat and lie
below the Fermi level, which are called d bands, and the sixth one
lie above the Fermi level, which is called the conduction band or
SP band (Figure 1b).30 The second peak at 575 nm in the visible region
might be due to the surface plasmon resonance effect,31 which is caused by the collective oscillation of free electrons
in the conduction band that resonated with the electromagnetic field
of the incident light giving rise to intraband transition within the
conduction band. The presence of two absorption bands in the visible
and NIR regions is a characteristic feature of anisotropic AuNFs,
which resulted from the free electrons in the conduction band oscillating
on the short axis forming a transverse peak at 575 nm and on the long
axis forming a longitudinal peak at 720 nm.32−36

2.2 Emission Spectra
Figure 2a shows the emission spectrum
of the AuNF colloidal solution, in which an intensity peak is observed
at 360 nm because of electron transition from the SP band to holes
in the d band, leading to a recombination of high-energy electrons
with high-energy holes producing high-energy photons. Other visible
multiple emission peaks are due to different transitions from the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels to the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO levels) in the SP band. Figure 2b shows that the doped AuNFs in the sol–gel
matrix have the same emission spectrum as the AuNF colloidal solution,
which indicates that Au retains its morphology and size in the silica
network, as shown in Figure 2c.

matrix at λex = 333 nm, and (c) AuNFs embedded in
sol–gel.

2.3 Characterization of AuNFs
Figure 3a shows the high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of AuNFs. The observed
images of the synthesized particle are flower-like, which consist
of a solid gold core with an average size of 48 ± 6 nm and irregular
tips with an average size 10 nm. Figure 3b shows that selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) is an important technique to determine the crystal structure
of various materials. It is a complementary technique for TEM, in
which the electrons are diffracted at a selected area, and bright
spots with a dark background are observed as a result of that. From
the SAED pattern, we obtain important information about the crystallinity
of AuNFs with a polynanocrystalline shape (small spots making up rings,
with each spot arising from the Bragg reflection of an individual
crystallite). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of AuNFs,
as shown in Figure 3c, show the morphology and the roughness of the AuNF surface with
a high surface area linking a large number of calcitonin molecules.

image of AuNFs.

2.4 Characterization of the Thin Film Optical
Biosensor
The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of
the thin film of AuNFs doped in a sol–gel/PEG matrix are shown
in Figure 4a. The spectrum
of the thin film contains two bands centered at 1100 and 952 cm–1, which are assigned to the (Si–O–Si)n and Si–OH stretching modes, respectively.
This confirms the formation of polymeric silica as a result of hydrolysis
and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). Also, the presence of
vibration modes at 526 cm–1 of M–O bonds
(M = Au, Si) indicates the bonding between metallic ions and oxygen
atoms in the xerogel network.37 The vibration
modes with energies at 2100 and 456 cm–1 are assigned
to the Si–H stretching and Si–O–Si bending modes,
respectively. As can be seen from Figure 4a, a comparison between the FTIR spectrum
of thin film doped AuNFs with the spectrum of the film immersed in
calcitonin solution shows that the intensities of some peaks are decreased.
This is attributed to the adsorption of calcitonin onto the thin film
surface.

thin film, (b) XRD pattern of AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG
matrix thin film, (c) (1) SEM image of the thin film with PEG only,
(2) SEM image of the film of AuNFs/sol–gel/PEG matrix, (3)
SEM image of the film of AuNFs/sol–gel/PEG matrix + calcitonin,
and (d) EDX spectrum of AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG matrix
thin film.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the thin film of AuNFs doped
in the sol–gel/PEG matrix is shown in Figure 4b. The XRD spectrum indicates the presence
of gold in a face-centered cubic phase and revealed that AuNFs corresponded
to the crystalline gold. The diffraction peaks at 2θ = 38°
(111), 44.13° (200), 64.35° (220), and 77.6° (311)
are identical with those reported for the standard gold metal (Au0).38 The observed four intense
peaks corresponding to the NPs are in agreement with the Bragg’s
reflections of gold identified with the diffraction pattern. Another
diffraction peak at 2θ = 25° (100) is assigned to SiO2 of the matrix. The SEM image of the thin film with the PEG
matrix does not show any detectable particle on the film, as shown
in Figure 4c1. However,
a remarkable number of particles with a uniform distribution are observed
on the SEM image of the thin film of AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG
matrix, as shown in Figure 4c2. In addition, for the thin film of AuNFs doped in sol–gel/PEG
matrix + calcitonin, the SEM image shows that calcitonin molecules
are physically adsorbed onto the surface of the gold sensor, as shown
in Figure 4c3. The
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis using the SEM method was carried
out to gain an insight about the elemental composition of the synthesized
material. Figure 4d
shows a typical EDX spectrum of AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG
matrix with C (46.5), O (45), Si (6.2), Au (2.3) wt % and C (55.05),
O (39.72), Si (3.1), Au (2.13) wt %.

2.5 Analytical Parameters
Figure 5a shows the solvents’
effect on the fluorescence intensity of the AuNF biosensor. The results
revealed that the fluorescence intensity is significantly influenced
by the solvent polarity, especially for acetonitrile, because acetonitrile
has a moderate polarity between water and ethanol (protic solvents)
and dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide (aprotic solvents). Therefore,
acetonitrile protects the excited state of the AuNFs from any quenching
sources. The effect of calcitonin concentration on the fluorescence
intensity of AuNF biosensors was studied under the optimum conditions
and is shown in Figure 5b. The detection process was found to be the quenching of the fluorescence
intensity of the AuNF biosensor by increasing the calcitonin concentration
up to 1000 pg/mL. The mechanism of sensing depends on the energy transfer
from the nano-optical AuNF biosensor in the excited state [surface
plasmon resonance effect,31 which is caused
by the collective oscillation of free electrons in the conduction
band that resonated with the electromagnetic field of the incident
light giving the intraband transition within the conduction band]
to the p-orbitals of NH2 and CONH2 terminal
groups in the calcitonin protein, as shown in Figure 5c. This indicates a probable involvement
of the dynamic quenching mechanism via energy transfer between the
quencher and the optical sensor through electrostatic collision. This
agrees well with the SEM and XRD results. The selectivity and the
validity of the proposed method were examined by studying the effect
of different interfering proteins, for example, CEA, CA 125, CA 19-9,
CA 15-3, albumin (0.7 g L–1), NaCl, KCl (2.0 ×
10–3 mol L–1), uric acid (0.08
g L–1), total protein (0.01 g L–1), urea (0.06 g L–1), glucose (0.08 g L–1), triglyceride (0.06 g L–1), on the fluorescence
spectrum of the AuNF biosensor thin film after the addition of [calcitonin].
The tolerable limit is the concentration of the added species individually
causing a deviation lower than 3% of the fluorescence intensity under
the optimum conditions of the biosensor. The results indicated no
significant observed effect on the intensity, Figure 5d.

3 Method Validation
3.1 Dynamic Range
The effect of calcitonin
concentrations on the fluorescence intensity of the AuNF optical biosensor
is shown in Figure 5b. From the Stern–Völmer plot, the critical concentration
of the quencher and the effective distance between the quencher and
the biosensor are C0 = 1/Ksv = 6.003 pg/mL and R0 =
7.35/C0–1/3 = 13.3 Å,
respectively. From the R0 value [>10 Å]
in the expected dynamic quenching mechanism, we can infer that an
energy transfer has occurred between the quencher and the biosensor
via electrostatic collision, which is consistent with the SEM and
XRD results. Data are obtained from the Stern–Völmer
plot of [(F0/F) –
1] versus [calcitonin], as shown in Figure S2. The fluorescence intensity at 360 nm decreases linearly with the
concentration of calcitonin above the range 0.01–1000 pg/mL
with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The limit of detection (LOD)
and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated, as shown in Table S1, according to ICH guidelines.39 Comparing the results obtained by the proposed
AuNF biosensor with other reported methods,14,40−46 the proposed method is found to have superior sensor stability,
lower LOD (0.707 pg/mL), and applied wide linear range (0.01–1000
pg/mL).

3.2 Accuracy and Precision of the Method
The accuracy and precision of the suggested method were evaluated
by carrying out the assessment three times in a day to determine the
intraday precision and three times in different days to determine
the average values for verifying the interday accuracy and precision
of the method. These measurements were performed on four control and
six test samples of the serum of patients with MTC. The results of
this study are summarized in Table 1. The percentage relative standard deviation (% RSD)
values of the proposed method were ≤0.006–1.1% (intraday)
and ≤0.104–1.1% (interday). These results approved the
high precision of the proposed method. Accuracy was assessed as percentage
relative error (% RE) between the measured mean concentrations and
the taken concentrations of calcitonin. Bias was calculated for each
concentration {bias % = [(concentration found – known concentration)
× 100/known concentration], and these results are also presented
in Table 1. % RE values
of ≤−2.50–3.77 (intraday) and ≤−2.50–4.17
(interday) demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed method.

3.3 Application
The calcitonin (thyrocalcitonin)
protein is a hormone present in humans and other mammals. This protein
is secreted by parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland.47 Calcitonin withdraws the calcium from the blood
when the calcium concentration increases above the normal range.

The analytical utility and applicability of the proposed method were
tested by the assessment of calcitonin concentration in various serum
samples (four samples of healthy persons and six samples of patients
with MTC in the age range of 25–70 years). The obtained average
values by the proposed method (4.16 ± 0.1 pg/mL) and (34.16 ±
0.02 pg/mL) match well with those obtained by the standard method
(4.86 ± 0.17 pg/mL) and (35.16 ± 0.24 pg/mL) for serum samples
of persons in the healthy state and patients with MTC, respectively,
as shown in Table 1.

4 Conclusions
In this work, we developed a new method for assessment of calcitonin,
which opens an excellent opportunity for a high-quality biomarker
for the early diagnosis of MTC. The calcitonin was determined by doping
the AuNF biosensor in the sol–gel/PEG matrix. The method depends
on measuring the fluorescence intensity quenching of the thin film
of the AuNF biosensor matrix under the optimized conditions. The established
method is more sensitive because of its lower LOD of 0.707 pg/mL compared
to the standard approach.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Apparatus
All the equipment used
in the present study are available in the Lab. of Prof. Dr. M. S.
Attia at Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Ain Shams University
and Institute of Nanoscience & Nanotechnology, Kafrelsheikh University.
The absorption spectra of the samples were measured in the range of
200–800 nm with a Shimadzu UV-2450 double-beam spectrophotometer.
All luminescence measurements were recorded on a Shimadzu RF5301PC
spectrofluorometer in the range (200–800 nm). The FTIR spectra
were measured with a JASCO FTIR-6800 in the range 400–4000
cm–1 using KBr pellets. The separation of protein
from samples was carried out by centrifuging the sample for 15 min
at 3000 rpm. The high-resolution imaging for the morphological investigation
of the samples was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron
microscope, Tokyo, Japan, with a resolution of 200 kV. A scanning
electron microscope (Sirion from FEI) equipped with an EDX detector
(S-3400N II, Hitachi, Japan) was used for the morphological investigation.
The crystallinity and the phase structure of the materials have been
studied using an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu 6000-XRD) using Cu
Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å).

5.2 Materials and Reagents
The starting
materials HAuCl4 (extra pure, about 51% Au, SLR, Fisher)
and HEPES (≥99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as received. TEOS
and PEG (MW 20,000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Calcitonin
tumor marker was purchased from Alfa-Aesar. NaCl, KCl, albumin, uric
acid, urea, and glucose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. High-purity
distilled water obtained using a Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore Corp.,
Bedford, MA, USA) was used throughout for all measurements. All the
other solvents were of high purity and obtained from Aldrich Chemical
Company (USA). A stock solution of 0.5 mg/mL calcitonin was prepared
by dissolving 0.5 mg of calcitonin in 1 mL deionized distilled water.
Working solutions (0.001–1000 pg/mL) of calcitonin were prepared
by accurate dilution of the stock solution with acetonitrile. Stock
and working solutions were stored at 0–4 °C. The luminescence
intensity was measured at λex/λem = 333/360 nm. Stock and working solutions were stored at 0–4
°C. The presence of CEA (130 U mL–1), CA 19-9
(130 U mL–1), CA 15-3 (130 U mL–1), and CA 125 (150 U mL–1) in combination with
calcitonin in the serum sample of patients with MTC is considered
a major problem in the assessment of calcitonin in the serum sample.
To solve this problem, the microplate containing the calcitonin antibody
was mixed with the serum sample of patients affected by MTC followed
by washing with phosphate buffer to obtain only the calcitonin. The
ΔF (ΔF is the subtraction
of the luminescence intensity of the optical sensor without and with
interfering species) value was calculated to determine the effect
of the interfering species on the competence of the optical biosensor
toward calcitonin. Human samples were obtained from the New Al Kasr
El Aini Teaching Hospital, Cairo University and Ain Shams Specialized
Hospital, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in accordance with the
WHO (World Health Organization)-approved protocol for human specimen
collection and for the use of these materials and related clinical
information for research purposes. All patients consented and approved
the use of their clinical samples in the research work.

5.3 General Procedures
5.3.1 Preparation of the Nano-Optical Sensor,
AuNFs Doped in Sol–Gel/PEG Matrix
3D branched AuNFs
with a solid core and more than 10 tips on their surface were synthesized
by the limited ligand protection (LLP) strategy using a simple, template-free,
and one-pot synthesis method with high yield and good size monodispersity
at room temperature. The size of the AuNFs could be adjusted by controlling
the molar ratio of HAuCl4 to HEPES. A common Good’s
buffer, HEPES, was used as a weak reducing agent and a particle stabilizing
agent to keep the growth of the AuNFs in 3Ds. AuNFs were synthesized
by the following method.48 In a typical
experiment, 0.25 mL of 20 mM HAuCl4 was added to 10 mL
of a 20 mM HEPES solution (pH 7.4) without shaking. The formation
of AuNFs was observed when the initial light-yellow mixture changed
to pink and then to a turbid blue colloidal solution at room temperature
within approximately 30 min, which can be used after 1 h. AuNFs were
synthesized through a three-step mechanism: reduction of Au(III) ions
to primary Au nanocrystals (step 1), agglomeration of the primary
Au nanocrystals into intermediate agglomerates (step 2), and anisotropic
growth of the agglomerates into gold flowers (step 3), Figure S3.

The AuNFs doped in sol–gel
using the method reported in our previous work was then prepared.49−57 The mixture consisting of TEOS, C2H5OH, and
H2O in a molar ratio of 1:5:1 was stirred for 15 min to
obtain a homogeneous solution, and then 5 mL of AuNF precursor was
added to the mixture with stirring for 5 min. Then, a few drops of
diluted HCl solution were added as a catalyst. The mixture was refluxed
for 1 h at 100 °C to obtain a precursor-dispersed sol solution,
which was cast into a glass cup and kept at 25 °C until it cooled
and then heated at 150 °C for 45 min to obtain a solidified and
transparent composite, as shown in Figure S4.

A solution of the thin film was prepared by dissolving 0.1 g of
the solidified and transparent sol–gel composite in 3 mL ethanol
and then adding 10 mL of PEG with stirring for 1.0 h until a homogenous
solution was obtained. A thin film was fabricated by spin-coating
on a small quartz slide (width 8.5 mm, height 25 mm) to outfit the
cuvette of the spectrofluorometer. First, the substrate slide was
cleaned with distilled water and surfactant, then ultrasonically for
30 min in distilled water and surfactant, followed by ultrasonic cleaning
for 10 min in acetone, and finally it was boiled for 10 min in 2-propanol.
Before spin-coating, the substrate was washed with 2-propanol and
spun until the film was fully dry. Then, the sol–gel solution
was dropped onto a cleaned substrate with a micropipette and was spun
at 3000 rpm for 30 s.

5.3.2 Recommended Procedure
An appropriate
volume (200 μL) of various standard concentrations of calcitonin
should be diluted to 10 mL with acetonitrile. The dilute solution
was mixed with a thin film of optical sensing AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG
matrix in the quartz cell of a spectrofluorometer. The luminescence
spectra were recorded at the excitation wavelength λex = 333 nm. The optical sensor was washed with acetonitrile after
each measurement and the calibration curve was built by plotting the
luminescence intensity at λem = 360 nm on the y axis versus the calcitonin concentration on the x axis.

5.4 Assay Principle
5.4.1 Standard Method for Calcitonin
The calcitonin immunoassay is a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay for the measurement of the biologically intact 32 amino acid
chain of calcitonin.58−60 It uses two different mouse monoclonal antibodies
to human calcitonin specific for well-defined regions on the calcitonin
molecule. One antibody binds only to calcitonin 11–23, and
this antibody is biotinylated, while the other antibody binds only
to calcitonin 21–32, and this antibody is labeled with horseradish
peroxidase [HRP] for detection. This method based on patient and control
samples should be read using the 450 nm wavelength for calcitonin
concentrations up to 300 pg/mL and using the 405 nm reading with calcitonin
concentrations above 300 pg/mL. The results obtained from calibrator
measurements are plotted as the curve of absorbance versus concentration,
so the concentration of calcitonin in human serum samples is determined
from this curve.

5.4.2 Assay Protocol
Calibrator, control,
and sample (100 μL each) were put in appropriate wells, and
then 50 μL of the working anti-CT–HRP conjugate was added
to all the wells and incubated for 18 ± 1 h at 2–8 °C,
and washed. The chromogenic solution (100 μL) was added to each
well within 15 min following the washing step. The microliter plate
was incubated for 30 min at room temperature avoiding direct sunlight,
and then 100 μL of the stop solution was added to each well.
The absorbance was read at 450 nm (reference filter, 630 or 650 nm)
within 1 h, and the results were calculated.

5.4.3 Proposed Method for Calcitonin
A 0.2 mL portion of each human serum sample was mixed with 10 mL
of acetonitrile and then centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to remove
serum proteins, and then the supernatant was collected. The optical
biosensor, AuNFs doped in the sol–gel/PEG matrix thin film,
was immersed in 2 mL of each serum solution in the measuring cuvette,
and the emission intensity was measured at 360 nm against the reagent
blank before and after serum addition, and the optical biosensor thin
film is washed with acetonitrile after each measurement. Therefore,
the calcitonin concentration can be determined by comparing the measured
intensity with the calibration plot. This method is used for further
measurements of the MTC patient samples.
