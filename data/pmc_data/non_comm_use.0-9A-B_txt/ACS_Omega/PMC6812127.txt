Interactions between
charges play a role in protein stability and
contribute to the energetics of binding between various charged ligands.
Ionic surfactants are charged molecules, whose interactions with proteins
are still rather poorly understood despite their wide applications.
Here, we show by isothermal titration calorimetry that cationic alkylammonium
surfactants bind to negatively charged polyaspartate and polyglutamate
homopolymers stoichiometrically, i.e., one surfactant molecule per
charged amino acid. Similarly, negatively charged alkyl sulfates (e.g.,
sodium dodecyl sulfate) and alkane sulfonates bind stoichiometrically
to positively charged polylysine, polyornithine, and polyarginine
homopolymers. In these reactions, the interacting counterparts form
ion pairs and the resulting electrostatically neutral complex coprecipitates
from solution. The enthalpies and heat capacities are determined for
various pairs of ionic surfactants and charged amino acid homopolymers.
These results show the energetic contributions of ionic headgroups
and the CH2 group to surfactant interactions with proteins.

Introduction
Interactions
between surfactants and proteins are governed by ionic,
hydrophobic, and van der Waals forces, but it is difficult to dissect
their energetic contributions in protein–ligand binding. The
interacting system may be simplified by instead performing the binding
reaction with amino acid homopolymers. The homopolymers made of charged
amino acids are highly soluble and may resemble the role of this amino
acid in real proteins and dissect the contributions of ionic and hydrophobic
interactions.

Mixtures of charged polymer and oppositely charged
monomer surfactant
molecules have broad technological applications.1−4 Interactions between polymers
and ionic surfactants have been studied by various techniques. For
example, nonionic water-soluble polymer interactions with ionic surfactants
in solution have been investigated by means of conductance, surface
tension, dye solubilization, viscosity, and dialysis equilibrium.5−9 Protein precipitation by detergents10−13 and more general studies of cationic
polymer interactions with anionic detergents14 were performed exploiting similar techniques to the ones used for
nonionic polymers. The circular dichroism technique was used to investigate
the detergent-initiated structural rearrangements of poly(amino acid)s
from a random coil to an α-helix or β-sheet.15−21 Light-scattering studies revealed that, for example, cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide binding to poly(acrylic acid) is governed by both electrostatic
attraction and hydrophobic interactions.22

The knowledge about the thermodynamics of polymer–surfactant
interactions increased with the development of microcalorimeters,
which directly determine the enthalpy of interaction in aqueous solution.
Early microcalorimetry studies examined the binding of ionic surfactants,
such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), to various globular proteins.23−25 Later, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to study
interactions between SDS and electrically neutral polymers, such as
poly(ethylene glycol)26 and poly(propylene
glycol),27 and other polymer–surfactant
systems.28,29 Wang et al.30 used ITC to study the adsorption of nonionic, cationic, and anionic
surfactants onto polymer lattices with a negative surface charge density.

Li et al.31 described the role of electrostatic
forces by investigating SDS and tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide
interactions with polymers that possess negatively charged groups.
Later Wang and Tam32 have investigated
cationic detergent (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide) binding to anionic
polymers, such as neutralized poly(acrylic acid) and methacrylic acid/ethyl
acrylate copolymers, using ITC. The authors concluded that electrostatic
binding of ionic headgroups to the charged sites on the polymer is
enthalpy-opposed and driven by entropy.

Li and Wagner33 have reported a semiempirical
relationship for the cooperative binding in oppositely charged, salt-free
polyelectrolyte–alkyl surfactant mixtures for a broad range
of systems. The authors have summarized that the cooperative binding
affinity of surfactants to oppositely charged polymers is determined
by two main factors—hydrophobicity of the surfactant and the
charge density of the polymer. In a comprehensive review on such interactions,
Khan and Brettmann34 concluded that the
binding of charged polymers to ionic surfactants is driven by both
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The authors also reviewed
many experimental factors that affect the strength of interaction,
but the effects of temperature were not discussed.

Despite numerous
applied techniques and various investigated surfactant–polymer
systems, full assignment of the energies involved in the recognition
between these molecules to molecular functional groups is uncertain.
The results here dissect the energetic contributions of binding of
several ionic surfactants to polyamino acids and show the additivity
of ionic and hydrophobic interactions.

Results and Discussion
For the study of binding between oppositely charged ionic surfactants
and ionic amino acid homopolymers by ITC, two surfactant–polymer
systems were chosen:1. Anionic alkyl sulfates (sodium octyl
sulfate, decyl sulfate, undecyl sulfate, dodecyl sulfate, octyl sulfonate,
nonyl sulfonate, and decyl sulfonate) with cationic poly(amino acid)s
(polyarginine, polylysine, and polyornithine hydrochlorides) (Figure 1A);

2. Cationic alkylammonium chlorides (decylammonium,
undecylammonium, dodecylammonium, and tridecylammonium) and anionic
poly(amino acid)s (polyaspartate and polyglutamate) (Figure 1B).

and poly(amino acid) systems used in this work. (A)
Anionic alkyl sulfates and cationic poly(amino acid)s (polyarginine,
polylysine, and polyornithine); (B) cationic alkylamines and anionic
poly(amino acid)s (polyaspartate and polyglutamate).

Titration of poly(amino acid)s bearing charged side chains
with
oppositely charged surfactants shows that the binding occurs only
until the charge neutralization point is reached, at approximately
one surfactant molecule added per amino acid of the polymer, meaning
that one surfactant molecule is bound to each amino acid. The interaction
strength depended on both the electrostatic attraction between charged
groups of the surfactant and polymer, and the hydrophobic interaction
between aliphatic tails of surfactants. ITC experiments at different
temperatures revealed that constant-pressure heat capacity (ΔCp) values were negative for these interactions.
The increase of a surfactant’s aliphatic tail by one CH2 group gives a constant negative contribution to the interaction
enthalpy.

Figure 2 shows the
raw ITC data (left panels) and isotherms (right panels) of (A,B) SDS
binding to poly(Arg+) and (C,D) dodecylammonium binding
to poly(Glu–) at T = 25 °C.
At this temperature, alkyl sulfate binding to poly(Arg+) is exothermic, whereas dodecylammonium binding to poly(Glu–) shows an endothermic profile. The isotherm of poly(Arg+) binding to SDS contains a distinct dip in the enthalpy at
the charge neutralization point (when one surfactant molecule is bound
to one amino acid monomer). A similar isotherm shape of SDS titration
into polyethyleneimines was observed by Wang et al.35 The first injection datapoints in Figure 2B,D are of lower accuracy because of the
time needed for thermal equilibration and partial diffusion of the
surfactant from the syringe to the cell prior to the first injection.
Here, we prefer not to remove the first datapoints, but it should
be kept in mind that their accuracy is lower than that of the later
datapoints.

Figure 2 Raw ITC data and isotherms of SDS binding to poly(Arg+) (A, B) and dodecylammonium binding to poly(Glu–) (C, D) at neutral pH. The syringe contained 5 mM surfactant solution
that was titrated into 0.5 mM (expressed per amino acid) solution
of poly(amino acid) at 25 °C.

Stoichiometry
and Dependence on Ionic Strength
ITC
data analysis revealed that in all reactions between the surfactant
and poly(amino acid), the heat is absorbed or released until the charge
neutralization point is reached. Further titration produces only dilution
heat. This leads to the conclusion that the binding stoichiometry
is 1:1; i.e., one molecule of the surfactant binds to a single amino
acid moiety of the polymer. We observed the same binding stoichiometry
in the majority of the investigated pairs of the surfactant and oppositely
charged poly(amino acid), similar to those in Figure 2, shown in later figures.

The reactions
between surfactants and poly(amino acid)s were investigated at various
ionic strengths by changing the NaCl concentration. The data in Figure 3 show that 50 mM and 200 mM concentrations of sodium
chloride diminished the binding stoichiometry, possibly by blocking
access to the charged groups of poly(amino acid). NaCl concentrations
of 1 M and higher completely terminated the binding of SDS to poly(Arg+) (see Figure S1 in the Supplementary
material). Dodecylamine binding to poly(Glu–) was
almost completely stopped by a 25 mM concentration of NaCl (Figure S2 in the Supplementary material). Such
differences in the concentration of NaCl that prevent poly(Glu–) and poly(Arg+) interactions with the surfactant
can be explained by the high affinity of the guanidinium group to
sulfates.36 Electrostatic interactions
between a surfactant and a poly(amino acid) were diminished at an
increased ionic strength of solution. High concentration of added
salt lowers the critical micelle concentration of ionic surfactants,
and micelles may become a dominating state of the surfactant in solution,
thus affecting the thermodynamics of binding.

Figure 3 Raw ITC data and isotherms
of SDS binding to poly(Arg+) at various concentrations
of added NaCl: (A, B) 0 mM, (C, D) 50
mM, and (E, F) 200 mM. Curves in (B, D, F) were obtained using the
1:1-binding model that yielded the stoichiometry parameter, n.

Binding Enthalpy as a Function
of Aliphatic Chain Length
To address the role of aliphatic
chain length in the binding process,
we conducted a series of experiments with various aliphatic tail lengths
of surfactants.

The beginning of the titration of poly(Lys+) and poly(Orn+) with alkyl sulfates exhibited
endothermic peaks at room temperature if the alkyl chain of the surfactant
was up to 10 carbon atoms (Figure 4E). Continuation of the titration followed one of two
possible scenarios: either the reaction remained endothermic, e.g.,
C8H17SO4––poly(Lys+), or the enthalpy began to decrease as the titration approached
the charge neutralization point and the reaction enthalpy became exothermic,
e.g., C10H21SO4––poly(Lys+). This phenomenon of endothermic-to-exothermic
reaction enthalpy change (and hence a change in the sign of enthalpy)
was absent in the poly(Lys+) and poly(Orn+)
systems if the surfactants had 11 or more carbon atoms in their aliphatic
chain and also in all of the investigated RSO4––poly(Arg+) systems (Figure 4C). However, the sign of enthalpy is dependent
on temperature due to heat capacity change upon binding as shown later.

Figure 4 Enthalpies
of surfactant–poly(amino acid) interactions as
a function of the aliphatic chain length at T = 25
°C. Linear alkyl sulfates and alkylamines were used to measure
their binding enthalpies to (A) positively and (B) negatively charged
poly(amino acid)s, respectively. Panels (C) and (E) show isotherms
of RSO4– binding to poly(Arg+) and poly(Lys+), and (D) and (F) show that of RNH3+ binding to poly(Glu–) and poly(Asp–), respectively.

In most cases, the titration of the negatively charged poly(Glu–) and poly(Asp–) with alkylammonium
also followed one of the two above-mentioned reaction enthalpy scenarios
(Figure 4D,F). A distinct
pair in the negatively charged poly(amino acid)s was C13H27NH3+–poly(Asp–) – its entire titration had exothermic peaks.

In panels
A and B of Figure 4, the measured ΔH values of surfactant–poly(amino
acid) interactions are plotted as a function of the total number of
carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain, m. Surfactants
with longer hydrophobic tail had a more negative contribution to the
interaction enthalpy. These dependencies showed a linear behavior
with the enthalpic contribution of the CH2 group for various
surfactant–poly(amino acid) systems varying from −2.7
kJ mol–1 to −0.92 kJ mol–1 per CH2 group at 25 °C.

The experimental ITC
data are summarized and presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Temperature Dependence of Interaction Enthalpy
Charged
surfactant binding to a poly(amino acid) of an opposite charge was
increasingly more exothermic at higher temperatures. The decrease
in interaction enthalpy (increase in its absolute value) was observed
in all of the tested systems (Figures 5–7). The data show that at higher temperatures the above-described
positive enthalpies at the beginning of titrations disappeared. For
example, in a RNH3+–poly(Glu–) system at 37 °C, the endothermic reaction profiles were observed
only for aliphatic chains of 10 and 11 carbon atoms, whereas in a
RNH3+–poly(Asp–) system
at 37 °C, they were seen only for decylammonium. The reactions
were already fully exothermic in all of the tested systems at 49 °C.

of temperature on the binding enthalpies. The lines fitted to the
data yielded the values of ΔCp.

Panel (B) shows the same data plotted as enthalpy versus the length

Figure 7 Enthalpies

at different temperatures. Panel (A) shows the effect of temperature
on the binding enthalpies. The lines fitted to the data yielded the
values of ΔCp. Panel (B) shows the
same data plotted as enthalpy versus the length of the surfactant
aliphatic chain at different temperatures yielding the methyl group
contribution to the interaction enthalpy. Panels (C)–(F) show
integrated ITC curves for binding of various alkylammonium surfactants
at different temperatures.

The plots of enthalpy as a function of temperature were used to
calculate the constant-pressure reaction heat capacities (ΔCp) by applying linear fits and assuming that
the heat capacity is temperature-independent. In the poly(Glu–) and poly(Asp–) systems, the ΔCp values were increasingly negative for the
alkylamines of longer aliphatic chains (Table 2). Slightly different tendencies were observed
in the RSO4––poly(Arg) system.
We determined ΔCp = (−0.18
± 0.04) kJ mol–1 K–1 for
C8H17SO4––poly(Arg+). The increased chain length resulted in an increase in the
absolute value of ΔCp and, within
an error range, it remained similar for other longer chain alkyl sulfate
series (Table 1).

Sulfonate and Sulfonic Acid Binding to Poly(amino acid)s
The enthalpies of alkyl sulfate binding to poly(Arg+)
were more negative than those of sulfonic acid bearing aliphatic chains
of the same length. The data show that the interaction enthalpy between
poly(Arg+) and alkyl sulfonic acid containing m carbon atoms in the aliphatic chain is approximately equal to the
interaction enthalpy between poly(Arg+) and alkyl sulfate
containing m – 1 carbon atoms (Figure 8). This suggests that the oxygen
atom between the sulfur and carbon atoms of the sulfate plays a similar
role to a CH2 group in the aliphatic chain.

Figure 8 Comparison between enthalpies
of alkyl sulfate (filled symbols,
continuous lines) and alkane sulfonate (open symbols, dashed lines)
binding to poly(Arg+), poly(Lys+), and poly(Orn+). The enthalpy as a function of chain length plots yielded
the CH2 group contribution to the interaction enthalpy.
The slopes were quite similar except for the short-chain alkane sulfonate
binding, where the enthalpy values were positive and small, thus difficult
to determine accurately.

The slope was not confirmed
in experiments of sulfonate binding
to other cationic poly(amino acid)s, where the enthalpies of binding
to either poly(Lys+) or poly(Orn+) seemed to
increase with longer alkyl chains, contrary to all of the other systems
studied in this paper. It appears that the slopes may still be similar
if longer chain surfactants had been tested. In these experiments,
enthalpies were close to zero and, therefore, were difficult to determine
accurately by ITC.

Heat Capacity of Surfactant Binding to Poly(amino
acid)s
The temperature dependencies of the enthalpy changes
upon binding
allowed estimating the constant-pressure heat capacities (ΔCp) of such binding reactions.

Figure 9 shows the heat capacities
obtained by applying linear fits to the enthalpy dependencies on temperature
under the assumption that the heat capacity is independent of temperature
and thus the slope remains constant within the studied 13–61
°C temperature range. All measured heat capacities were negative
in sign and increased in absolute value upon increasing the surfactant
chain length. With a possible exception of poly(Arg+),
the dependencies of the heat capacity on chain length were linear,
yielding the ΔCp of the CH2 group equal to (−0.092 ± 0.018) kJ mol–1 K–1 (Figure 9). In our opinion, the model is consistent with a case
when the slopes are identical, but additional data may be necessary
to confirm this conclusion.

Figure 9 ΔCp values
of varied-length alkyl
sulfate surfactant binding to poly(Arg+) and alkylammonium
surfactant binding to poly(Asp–) and poly(Glu–). The dependencies on alkyl chain length were approximated
as linear yielding the values of the ΔCp of the CH2 group equal to −0.061 kJ mol–1 K–1 for poly(Arg+),
−0.075 kJ mol–1 K–1 for
poly(Asp–), and −0.10 kJ mol–1 K–1 for poly(Glu–). The average
was (−0.092 ± 0.018) kJ mol–1 K–1.

Figure 10 shows
an alternative way of obtaining the heat capacity by plotting the
temperature dependencies for the enthalpies of CH2 group
contribution to the binding to poly(amino acid). The obtained average
value of the ΔCp of the CH2 group was similar to the average value from Figure 9 and was equal to (−0.064 ± 0.006)
kJ mol–1 K–1.

Figure 10 Enthalpy contributions
of the CH2 group for alkyl sulfate
surfactant binding to poly(Arg+) and alkylammonium binding
to poly(Asp–) and poly(Glu–),
at different temperatures. The values were obtained from the slopes
of linear fits shown in panels (B) of Figures 5–7. The slopes
yielded approximate ΔCp values for
the CH2 group equal to −0.056 kJ mol–1 K–1 for poly(Arg+), −0.062 kJ
mol–1 K–1 for poly(Asp–), and −0.071 kJ mol–1 K–1 for poly(Glu–). The average was (−0.064
± 0.006) kJ mol–1 K–1.

In this paper, we described ITC data obtained for
two systems of
oppositely charged molecules: (1) cationic poly(amino acid)s–anionic
surfactants and (2) anionic poly(amino acid)s–cationic surfactants.
The ITC data showed that surfactants bind stoichiometrically to the
oppositely charged moieties of poly(amino acid)s with a charge ratio
of 1:1. The small discrepancies from this stoichiometry ratio can
be attributed to the deviations in the concentration of both the poly(amino
acid) and surfactant solutions. Previous elemental analysis of the
poly(amino acid) showed that up to 20% of water could be present in
these batches,37 which could also affect
the binding stoichiometry.

The majority of surfactant–poly(amino
acid) isotherms had
a dip (decrease) in enthalpy at the charge neutralization point. This
additional enthalpy might be a result of aggregate formation or structural
transitions of the polymer. McCord et al.38 have determined that SDS induces the formation of an ordered polyarginine
with an α-helix structure at the charge neutralization point.
The values for enthalpy of an α-helix formation were in the
range of −2 to −0.9 kcal mol–1 per
residue,39−41 which is in agreement with our results.

The
CH2 group contributed almost two times less enthalpy
to the systems of poly(Orn+) and poly(Glu–) if compared to all of the other surfactant–poly(amino acid)
systems at 25 °C. According to the literature,17,18,21,38 poly(Orn+), poly(Glu–), and poly(Arg+)
undergo a coil-to-helix transition after the neutralization point
is reached. Poly(Lys+) undergoes a coil-to-β-sheet
transition with all of the tested surfactants except octyl sulfate,
whereas poly(Asp–) does not undergo a transition
to the more structured state. There seems to be no clear correlation
between the CH2 group contributions to the enthalpy and
the transitions in the secondary structure. Some of these transitions
may also be too slow to be observed in an ITC experiment.42

We also considered the counterion condensation
effect in these
systems. As discussed previously,37 the
charge density parameter in the poly(amino acid) systems was less
than a critical value, which marks the initial point of counterion
condensation. Thus, the counterion condensation effect was negligible
and did not interfere with the binding in the investigated surfactant–poly(amino
acid) systems.

The negative ΔCp values in this
study were similar to those of hydrocarbon transfer from water to
an organic solvent,43 suggesting that the
hydrophobic tail interaction between bound surfactants was a plausible
explanation for the observed enthalpies. A linear increase in the
absolute value of the binding enthalpy with the chain length of a
surfactant means that longer chain surfactants are more prone to binding.
This increase in enthalpy was present in all surfactant–poly(amino
acid) pairs, even those with endothermic interaction profiles. However,
the CH2 group contributions to the interaction enthalpy
were similar in various systems. The highest increased-tail surfactant
contribution was in the RSO4––poly(Arg+) system. The strong affinity between sulfate and guanidinium
groups36 is also accompanied by a more
strict geometry of the salt bridge, which seems to be also related
to the higher surfactant’s tail contributions to the binding
enthalpy.

Our previous studies have shown that the enthalpy
of aliphatic
chain interaction between themselves can indicate whether the chains
aggregate to a liquid phase or a solid phase. The difference in the
enthalpies of binding can match the enthalpy of fusion.44−47 The enthalpy of the CH2 group binding into a liquid form
yielded the value of −1.25 kJ mol–1, whereas
upon binding into the solid form, the absolute value was greater and
was equal to −5.2 kJ mol–1 per CH2 group.46 Here in this study, the value
was in the range of −2.7 to −0.92 kJ mol–1 per CH2 group, and the absolute magnitude indicates that
the phase of the poly(amino acid)–surfactant complex may be
liquid or solid, but only part of the contacts have formed between
the aliphatic chains in the solid because poly(amino acid)s are quite
bulky and would not enable a conformation where surfactant aliphatic
chains fully bind to each other. Therefore, it is most likely that
the chains only partially interact with each other and the remaining
length of the chains interacts with the amino acids of the polymer.
Furthermore, all of these interactions occur in aqueous solution,
and thus are highly dependent on hydration-related effects. Charged
ionic groups are strongly hydrated, whereas the aliphatic chains are
poorly hydrated resulting in opposite effects upon binding.

Conclusions
The stoichiometry of charged surfactants binding to oppositely
charged linear poly(amino acid)s is one molecule of surfactant per
amino acid moiety of the polymer. The high ionic strength of the solutions
diminishes the electrostatic interactions between the surfactants
and the poly(amino acid)s. The increased length of surfactant’s
aliphatic chain results in a more favorable interaction enthalpy.
The observed enthalpy gain per CH2 group in longer aliphatic
chains is similar in various surfactant–poly(amino acid) systems.

nonylamine, decylamine, undecylamine, dodecylamine, and tridecylamine—were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics, either as hydrochloride
salts or as amines. The following anionic surfactants were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and Acros Organics as sodium salts: 1-decanesulfonic
acid, 1-nonanesulfonic acid, 1-octanesulfonic acid, dodecyl sulfate,
undecyl sulfate, decyl sulfate, and octyl sulfate. Poly(l-glutamic acid) sodium salt, poly(l-aspartic acid) sodium
salt, poly(l-arginine) hydrochloride, poly(l-lysine)
hydrochloride, and poly(l-ornithine)
hydrochloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Alamanda Polymers.
Polyamino acids were of variable length, ranging from 50 to 700 amino
acids per polymer molecule. Solutions were prepared by dissolving
substances in distilled Milli-Q water. Solutions from pure amines
were prepared by dissolving them in Milli-Q water and titrating with
HCl until the pH value of 5 was reached and amines were visibly dissolved.
Polyamino acid stock solutions were prepared as 50 mM, their concentration
expressed per amino acid. Concentrations of the surfactant stock solutions
ranged from 5 to 20 mM. Polyamino acid solutions were stored at 4
°C, whereas surfactants and salts at 20 °C. The ITC experiments
were performed a large number of times (e.g., poly(Arg+)with SDS over 10 times) using the surfactants of different producers
to avoid their purity-related effects.

ITC Experiments
Concentrations of poly(amino acid)s
were determined by weighing and were expressed per amino acid monomer
in the ITC experiments. The purity of the poly(amino acid)s and their
elemental analysis were described previously.37 The majority of experiments were performed with a Nano ITC calorimeter
(TA Instruments) with cell and syringe volumes of 1.00 mL and 250
μL, respectively. Some experiments were repeated using a Microcal
(Northampton, MA) Micro-Calorimetry System calorimeter with cell and
syringe volumes of 1.4 mL and 250 μL, respectively. Calorimeter
measurements were validated by performing the measurement of electrical
pulses of known applied power and also by titrating Tris base with
nitric acid.48

The calorimeter cell
was usually loaded with a (0.5–2) mM solution of the poly(amino
acid), expressed per amino acid, and the syringe was loaded with a
(3.75–20) mM solution of the oppositely charged surfactant.
The majority of experiments were performed with a 1 mM polymer solution
(per amino acid) in the cell and a 10 mM surfactant solution in the
syringe. This setup is assumed as a default in this article unless
stated otherwise. The distribution of poly(amino acid) size varied
from 50 to 700 amino acids per polymer molecule.

The usual titration
at a constant temperature was carried out in
25 injections of 10 μL at time intervals of at least 4 min and
with a syringe stirring speed of 200 rpm. Data for at least 3 min
were collected prior to the first injection to ensure the stability
of the baseline. Before an experiment, the calorimeter cell was washed
with Milli-Q water and pre-rinsed with the solution for the cell.
Experiments were performed in the temperature range from 13 °C
to 61 °C.

Calculation of Reaction Enthalpies
One binding site
model, which is commonly used in the ITC data analysis, was not suitable
to accurately analyze most of the experimental data. Therefore, we
calculated enthalpies of surfactant binding to poly(amino acid)s by
integrating areas under the isotherm curve. Isotherms were obtained
using NITPIC software,49 which generated
a noise-filtered baseline and integrated the experimental peaks according
to the new baseline. Reaction enthalpies were determined by calculating
the area under the isotherm using a numerical trapz function from
the SciPy package for Python 3.50 The dilution
heats of the titrants were essentially negligible as compared to the
poly(amino acid)–surfactant reaction heats, and they were subtracted
from the isotherms prior to integration.
