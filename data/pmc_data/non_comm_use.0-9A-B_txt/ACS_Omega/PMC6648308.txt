Four
different samples of ordered mesoporous silica powders (MCM-41
and SBA-15) and amino-functionalized mesoporous silica (MCM-41-NH2 and SBA-15-NH2) were used to prepare modified
glassy carbon electrodes coated with ion-exchange polymer Nafion to
be used for the electrochemical detection of Cd(II). The mesoporous
silica samples were characterized through transmission electron microscopy,
small-angle X-ray scattering, and N2-adsorption/desorption
isotherms. The electrodes were characterized by using square wave
anodic stripping voltammetry. The effect of pH and of the silica type
on the electrodes’ response was investigated. The influence
of amino functional groups grafted on the silica surface toward Cd(II)
ion detection was also examined. The detection limits determined with
the new silica-modified electrodes [between 0.36 and 1.68 μM
Cd(II)] are slightly higher than those reported in the literature,
but they are lower than those stipulated in the European legislation
[45 μM Cd(II)] and, consequently, the electrodes could be successfully
used to detect Cd(II) in aqueous solutions.

1 Introduction
Cadmium ion detection
is of great interest because of their long
half-life and accumulation in tissues and organs, mainly in kidneys
and liver.1 Cd(II) is essentially a cumulative
poison exhibiting carcinogenic activity, and for these reasons, the
measurement of cadmium is important in clinical and toxicology laboratories.
Electrochemical detection of Cd(II) has great potential for environmental
monitoring of toxic metal ions because of the portability of electrodes
and their excellent detection limits (DLs). The detection can be carried
out by using mainly anodic stripping voltammetry with different modified
electrodes: carbon paste electrodes modified with zirconium-phosphated
silica,1 diacetyldioxime,2 zeolites,3,4 carbon nanotubes,5 conducting polymers,6 and so
forth; bismuth-modified carbon electrodes;7−13 silica-modified electrodes;14−17 and many others.18,19

Ordered
mesoporous silica (OMS) materials have widely been investigated
for several applications. Since their discovery in the 1990s,20 they have been used for catalysis,21,22 biocatalysis,23−26 adsorption,27,28 and as drug delivery carriers.29−32 The main goal of these materials is due to their large specific
surface area and highly uniform pore size. Despite their low conductivity,
OMSs can be used for electrode material preparation because of their
high adsorption capacity and large specific surface area, which could
be advantageously exploited in the preconcentration of electroactive
analytes before their electrochemical detection.33 As nonconductors, OMSs do not contribute to the charging
current when they are used as electrode modifiers, thus leading to
low background.34 On the other hand, silica-based
mesoporous materials can be grafted with a large variety of organic
functionalities, which prevent their leaching from the electrode surface,
leading to a good stability of the electrodes, or facilitate the electrode
reaction. In this context, we recently compared SBA-15 and MCM-41
as matrices for the modification of glassy carbon (GC) electrodes
for the voltammetric detection of malachite green.35

In this work, four different OMS powders belonging
to two different
classes (MCM-41 and SBA-15) were used to prepare modified GC electrodes
coated with Nafion to be used for the electrochemical detection of
Cd(II) ions. The influence of the silica type and their characteristics
on the electrochemical response of the modified electrodes was investigated
by using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) at two pH
values (6 and 4.4). In order to better understand the differences
between the electrochemical behavior of the electrodes fabricated
with different types of silica, the role of amino functional groups
grafted on the silica surface in the Cd(II) ion detection was also
examined.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of OMS Samples
The synthesized mesoporous
silica materials, MCM-41 and SBA-15,
were functionalized with aminopropyl-triethoxysilane to obtain the
aminopropyl-functionalized MCM-41-NH2 and SBA-15-NH2 samples. The four samples were then characterized through
N2-physisorption isotherms, small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The N2-physisorption isotherms of MCM-41, SBA-15, and the relative amino-functionalized
samples are shown in Figure 1A. MCM-41 and MCM-4-NH2 (type IV) isotherms show
an increase of N2 volume adsorption at a relative pressure
between 0.2 and 0.4 p/p0. The isotherms are reversible and do not show any appreciable hysteresis
loop. SBA-15 and SBA-15-NH2 also exhibit a type IV isotherm,
with a sharp increase of N2 volume adsorption at the relative
pressure of p/p0 = 0.6–0.7,
as expected considering their wider pores with respect to those of
MCM-41-based materials. In this case, a H1 hysteresis cycle due to
the capillary condensation of nitrogen into the mesopores occurs.
The SBA-15-NH2 curve is shifted toward low adsorbed nitrogen
volumes with respect to that of SBA-15. Indeed, the functionalization
step with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) brings to a decrease
of the pore volume and of the pore size. Figure 1B shows the pore size distributions for the
four mesoporous silica samples. The obtained values of the surface
area, pore volume, and the maximum of the pore size distribution are
all reported in Table 1. The SAXS patterns of all mesoporous silica samples, shown in Figure 1C, have the typical
pattern of hexagonal structures, that is an intense peak because of
the reflection of the (100) plane and two weaker peaks because of
the reflection of the (110) and (200) planes, respectively. The peaks
for SBA-15 and SBA-15-NH2 samples fall at lower q values
than those of MCM-41 and MCM-41-NH2 as a result of larger
lattice parameter (a) values (Table 1). TEM micrographs confirm that both MCM-41
(Figure 1D) and SBA-15
(Figure 1E) are constituted
by parallel channels organized according to an ordered hexagonal array.
Moreover, TEM images clearly show that MCM-41 particles are quasispherical
with a diameter of around 80–100 nm, whereas SBA-15 particles
have a hexagonal shape and a size of about 500 nm.

2.2 Influence
of pH and of Silica Type
The effect of the nature of the
silica types on the voltammetric
response of the silica-modified electrodes toward Cd(II) detection
was investigated at two pH values (4.4 and 6). By anodic stripping
voltammetry (SWASV), the analyte of interest is electrodeposited on
the working electrode during a reduction step and then oxidized from
the electrode during the stripping step, the resulting current being
measured.36 Thus, for Cd(II) detection
by SWASV, a first step of preconcentration was operated at −1.3
V versus Ag/AgCl,KClsat during an accumulation time of
120 s, which was chosen after preliminary experiments as the optimal
deposition time. The performance of each silica type in the same experimental
conditions was evaluated and discussed. The SWASV responses are presented
in Figure 2.

Figure 2 SWASV measurements
for GC/Nafion and GC/silica/Nafion electrodes
in 4 μM Cd(II) solution at pH 6 (A) and 4.4 (B). Experimental
conditions: electrolyte, 0.1 M phosphate buffer; starting potential,
−1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl, KClsat; frequency, 25 Hz; amplitude,
0.005 V; step potential, 0.004 V; deposition potential −1.3
V vs Ag/AgCl, KClsat; deposition time, 120 s; equilibration,
10 s; electrode conditioning, 0 V vs Ag/AgCl, KClsat; duration,
60 s, deoxygenation using Ar for 5 min before measurements and 30
s between each measurement.

It can be observed that at both pH values, the peak currents
increase
significantly at silica-modified electrodes. This is certainly due
to the increase of the electrode-specific surface area in the presence
of silica and to its ability to adsorb electroactive species during
the accumulation step. Additionally, a broadening of the peaks is
noticed, especially at higher concentrations of Cd(II) (Figure 3). A possible explanation could
be a sluggishness of the electrode kinetics or interactions between
adsorbed species that may be expected to become more significant as
the surface coverage increases.37 There
is also a slight difference in oxidation potential between electrodes
at the two pH values illustrated in Table 2 for SBA-15 and SBA-15-NH2-modified
GC electrodes, suggesting that at more acidic pH values the electron
transfer takes place more easily.

buffer of pH 6 (left) and

0.004 V; deposition potential −1.3 V vs Ag/AgCl, KClsat; deposition time, 120 s; equilibration, 10 s; electrode conditioning,
0 V vs Ag/AgCl, KClsat; duration, 60 s, deoxygenation using
Ar for 5 min before measurements and 30 s between each measurement.
The error bars correspond to the mean of three successive measurements
with three different electrodes.

GC/SBA-15/Nafion	–0.751	–0.809	
GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion	–0.728	–0.778	
As expected, the height of the oxidation peak of Cd
increases with
its concentration, leading to a calibration curve where a linear domain
at low concentration of Cd(II) can be identified (see as example Figure 3 for the GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion electrodes at pH 6).

2.3 Calibration
Curves and Electroanalytical Parameters
The calibration curves
corresponding to all modified electrodes
at the beginning of their linear domain are presented in Figure 4. In fact, the different
modified electrodes showed different linearity ranges, which depend
on both the OMS sample and the operational pH, as reported in Table 3. Table 3 also reports other electroanalytical
parameters as, for example, the DLs, which were calculated for a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3, using the formula: , where the slope and standard
deviation
(SD) correspond to the parameters of the fitting equation.

All silica
powders have a good impact on the detection of metal
ions because of their adsorption properties. At both tested pH values,
the DL is smaller for GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion than for GC/SBA-15/Nafion
electrodes, which suggests a better efficiency to detect Cd(II) of
the first ones. The effect is more pronounced at pH 6. It is probable
that amino groups bind metal ions, increasing their concentration
at the interface38 and hence lowering the
DLs.

The effect of pH is less remarkable in the case of GC/MCM-41-NH2/Nafion and GC/MCM-41/Nafion electrodes. A decrease of DL
at the GC/MCM-41-NH2/Nafion electrode is noticed at pH
6, but no significant differences of sensitivities and DLs were noticed
between MCM-41 and MCM-41-NH2 at pH 4.4. It should also
be mentioned that despite its smaller specific surface area, the SBA-15-NH2 sample was proven to be more performing than MCM-41-NH2 in which the DL is concerned. From data listed in Table 3, we also observe
that the electrode sensitivity depends both on the type of silica
and on the solution pH. SBA-15-NH2 has a higher sensitivity
at both pHs than the unmodified SBA-15 (approximately four times higher
at pH 6 and three times higher at pH 4.4). This could be due to the
fact that at pH 6, the coordination of Cd(II) by amino groups is the
driving mechanism and, at pH 4.4, the protonation of −NH2 groups may decrease cadmium coordination. Even if the DL
values are higher than those reported by other authors,1 the proposed electrodes could be successfully
used to determine Cd(II) in industrial sources of heavy metals, such
as industrial wastewater and sewage sludge, where the concentration
of Cd(II) could be relatively high.39

2.4 Reproducibility and Repeatability
Reproducibility
of the GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion electrode
was assessed at pH 6 on four consecutive measurements of 10 μM
solution of Cd(II) and the mean value of the obtained peak current
was 1.828 × 10–5 A, with a relative SD (RSD)
of 5.87%. Repeatability was tested on three different electrodes in
the same 4 μM Cd(II) solution and the mean value of the obtained
peak current was 6.304 × 10–6 A, with an RSD
of 1.90%.

2.5 Real Sample Analysis
Determination
of Cd(II) concentration was performed by SWASV, with the GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion electrode, on a natural underground water sample,
collected by drilling from a site situated in Salaj district (Romania).
The peak height value, measured three times (with the same electrode)
and mediated, was interpolated on a premade calibration curve, and
the concentration was determined. The calibration curve was done on
a 0.5–10 μM Cd(II) concentration range, at pH 6 (considering
that the pH of the water sample was 5.5, determined before the SWASV
measurement), under the same working conditions as all SWASV measurements
before (for experimental conditions, see Figure 3).

The performances of the proposed
electrochemical method of detection for Cd(II) were compared against
the standard F-AAS method, with results presented in Table 4. As observed, the agreement
between the results obtained by the two methods was very good. By
using the silica-modified electrode, the Cd(II) concentration was
found to be 98.09% from the standard method.

3 Conclusions
Four different mesoporous silica powders
were used to prepare modified
GC electrodes coated with ion-exchange polymer Nafion to be used for
the electrochemical detection of Cd(II). The silica powders have a
good impact on the detection of metal ions because of their adsorption
properties. The large specific surface area of silica powders certainly
plays a key role in their performance, but in some cases, the most
important is the effect of the −NH2 groups, which
have a beneficial influence, most probably because of the complexation
possibility of cadmium ions. Other characteristics could also be taken
into consideration. The electrodes’ analytical performances
increase in the series: GC/SBA-15/Nafion (pH 4.4 and 6) ≅ GC/MCM-41/Nafion
(pH 6) < GC/MCM-41/Nafion (pH 4.4) ≅ GC/MCM-41-NH2/Nafion (pH 4.4 and 6) ≅ GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion (pH
4.4) < GC/SBA-15-NH2/Nafion (pH 6). Even though the
DL values determined with the new silica-modified electrodes are slightly
higher than those reported in the literature, the electrodes are easy
to prepare and could successfully be used to detect Cd(II) in real
aqueous solutions.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Tetraethoxysilane (98%),
hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, >99%), Pluronic copolymer
123 (EO20-PO70EO20), sodium hydroxide,
anhydrous toluene (99.8%), APTES (>98%), triethylamine (>99%),
and
hydrochloric acid (37%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan).
A 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution was prepared from NaH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
The pH of the buffer solutions was adjusted to the desired values
by adding H3PO4 solution (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Nafion (5% in ethanol)
solution were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Distilled water was used
for preparing all solutions. All reagents were of analytical degree
and were used without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis,
Functionalization, and Characterization
of OMS Samples
MCM-41 and SBA-15 samples were synthesized
according to the procedures reported in refs (39) and (40), respectively. The organic
surfactants, either CTAB or Pluronic 123, were removed by calcination
at 550 °C for 5 h. The functionalized MCM-41-NH2 (SBA-15-NH2) was prepared by adding 1 mL of APTES to a suspension of
1 g of MCM-41 (SBA-15) in 30 mL of anhydrous toluene. The mixture
was heated under reflux for 15 h. The resulting solid was filtered
and washed with acetone and dried overnight under vacuum at room temperature.31 Textural analysis was carried out on an ASAP
2020 instrument by determining the N2-adsorption/-desorption
isotherm at 77 K. Before analysis, MCM-41 and SBA-15 samples were
heated at 250 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min under vacuum for
12 h, whereas MCM-41-NH2 and SBA-15-NH2 were
heated at 110 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min under vacuum for
24 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)41 and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)42 methods were used to calculate the specific
surface area and pore size distribution (from the desorption branch),
respectively. SAXS patterns were recorded by means of a S3-MICRO SWAXS
camera system (HECUS X-ray Systems, Graz, Austria). Thin-walled 2
mm glass capillaries were filled with the sample for the scattering
experiments and analyzed under the same conditions reported in ref (26). TEM images were obtained
on a JEOL 100S microscope, and finely ground samples were placed directly
onto formvar-coated electron microscopy nickel grids.

4.3 Preparation of GC/Silica/Nafion-Modified Electrodes
Before conducting any measurements, the GC working electrode was
cleaned thoroughly on a piece of felt with γ-alumina paste until
mirror-like shine was obtained. It was subsequently washed in an ultrasound
bath with distilled water to rinse off any trace of alumina. Mesoporous
silica suspensions were stabilized by means of sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS),35 which allowed to obtain a homogeneous
suspension and to prevent precipitation and aggregation of silica
particles. The suspensions (5 μL) were applied by drop-casting
on the electrode’s active surface and dried. To improve stability,
a coating with 5 μL of 0.5% Nafion was created using the same
method.

4.4 Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical experiments were performed on a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT
302N, electrochemical workstation (Eco Chemie, The Netherlands). A
three-electrode system was used, composed of an Ag/AgCl, a KClsat reference electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode,
and a GC working electrode, bare or modified. The electrolyte solution
was 0.1 M phosphate buffer (adjusted at pH 4.4 and 6). The two pH
values were selected, according to literature data,43,44 in order to find the best working conditions, taking into account
that the behavior of −NH2-containing silica powders
is influenced by the acidity of the buffer solution. pH values above
6.0 can decrease the electrode signal noticeably, as Cd(II) ions would
precipitate as hydroxide sediments.19 All
experiments were performed at room temperature. Square wave voltammetry
measurements were performed using a preconcentration time of 120 s
at −1.3 V, followed by a potential stripping from −1.3
to −0.4 V, with a frequency of 25 Hz.

4.5 Real
Sample Analysis
The real underground
water sample was analyzed by F-AAS (atomic absorption spectroscopy
in flame) with a contrAA 800 F atomic absorption spectrometer. The
analysis was repeated three times, and the results were mediated for
comparison with the electrochemical method.
