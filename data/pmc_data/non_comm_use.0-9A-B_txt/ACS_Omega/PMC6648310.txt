This work comprises
the shape- and facet-dependent
catalytic efficacies of different morphologies of CeO2,
namely, hexagonal, rectangular, and square. The formation of different
shapes of CeO2 is controlled using polyvinyl pyrrolidone
as a surfactant. The surface reactivity of formation of differently
exposed CeO2 facets is thoroughly investigated using UV–visible,
photoluminescence, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies.
A correlation between the growth of a surface-reactive facet and the
corresponding oxygen vacancies is also established. Considering the
tremendous contamination, caused by the textile effluents, the present
study articulates the facet-dependent photocatalytic activities of
pristine CeO2 for complete degradation of methylene blue
within 175 min. The observed degradation time deploying pristine CeO2 as a catalyst is the shortest to be reported in the literature
to our best knowledge.

Introduction
Synthetic
dyes are found in a wide range of products such as clothes,
leather accessories, and furniture. However, a side effect of their
widespread use is that up to 12% of these dyes are wasted during the
dying process and about 20% of this wastage enters the environment
(mainly into water supply). Water contamination from the textile industries
is one of the major threats in the present time as a side effect of
the widespread use of dyes which are hugely wasted and reportedly
20% of that wastage comes to the environment directly via water.1 It
is a terrifying fact that during the dying process, about 15% of the
total world production of dyes are released as textile effluents which
irreparably damage the eco system and which is a dangerous source
of nonaesthetic pollution, eutrophication, and agitation in aquatic
life.2 Especially for the third-world countries,
the purification of dye-contaminated water is one of the most challenging
environmental problems. The existing conventional treatments like
chemical coagulation or adsorption do not serve the purpose satisfactorily
as they convert the dyes from the liquid to the solid phase which
requires further treatment and the effective cost of the process increases
as well.3 In the last few years, photocatalysis
has come up to be a promising and widely accepted method for the treatment
of waste water-containing dyes.4,5 The dyes that come from
the textile wastage are majorly azo-dyes in nature and prone to photocatalytic
degradation under UV irradiation where the semiconductor metal oxides
or sulphides provide oxidizing radicals causing the degradation. Among
all the available materials, cerium oxide semiconductor metal oxides
are of high choice because of their highest abundance in nature and
tunable oxidizing property, resulting from facile transition between
Ce4+ and Ce3+.6,7 The surface
redox efficacies of ceria are greatly dependent on their surface defects
which are highly influenced by their crystallographic structures and
morphologies. Different shapes expose different active planes of ceria,
differing in their performance in surface catalysis. (100), (110),
and (111) are the three low-index lattice planes of ceria, and according
to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, their reactivity
order follows the order (100) > (110) > (111).8−11 It
implies that the generation of oxygen vacancies, favorable for catalytic
activity, is higher in the structures where the (100) plane is exposed
than that in (110) and (111).12 The exposure
of different planes depends on the shapes of nanoparticles. Reportedly,
formation of octahedral or truncated octahedral shapes is associated
with most stable exposed (111) facets,13 whereas the nanocube-like structures correspond to the most surface
active (100) plane.14 In the last few years,
there are numerous reports on the photocatalytic degradation of textile
dyes using doped, undoped, or composites of ceria.15 Pouretedal et al. described the process of methylene blue
(MB) degradation using bare CeO2 at different pH values,
though complete degradation was not obtained in their case.16 Upto 70% degradation of MB is investigated using
three-dimensional ordered macroporous CeO2 prepared on
the fluorine-doped tin oxide substrates.17 Channei and his group reported the catalytic efficiency of Fe-doped
ceria quenching of the band gap after doping.18 The complete degradation time of MB is reduced from 23 to 14 h using
samarium- and gadolinium-doped CeO2 nanoparticles instead
of bare ceria.19 Besides the doped CeO2 materials, many mixed oxides, nanohybrids, and composites
of cerium are widely ventured for the dye degradation purpose.20−22 The present article delineates
the shape-controlled synthesis process of ceria nanostructures with
three different exposed low-index facets, resulting in hexagonal,
rectangular, and cuboidal shapes. The formation mechanism is detailed,
explaining the plausible role of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a structure-directing
additive. The semiconducting features of the crystallographic structures
are well corroborated with their respective shapes and analyzed in
the light of their photoluminescence (PL) property. The effect and
influence of different morphologies, dominated by different crystallographic
planes, are thoroughly investigated for their photocatalytic degradation
efficiency of MB.

Results and Discussion
Crystallographic and Morphological
Analysis
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of synthesized
materials Ce-1,
Ce-2, and Ce-3 indicated the formation of a fluorite cubic structure
(FCC) phase (JCPDS card no. 34-1394), provided in Figure S1. The crystallite size and lattice parameters of
the samples were calculated using Scherrer eq 1 1  where K is a constant equal
to 0.89, λ is
the X-ray wavelength equal to 0.154 nm, β is the full width
at half maximum, and θ is the half diffraction angle. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images reveal the morphology of the prepared
CeO2 materials. Figure 1a–c shows the formation of hexagonal, rectangular,
and cuboidal type structures in Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3, respectively.
The corresponding high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs [with inset
showing fast Fourier transform (FFT)] of Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3 are
presented in Figure 1d–f, respectively. The occurrence of different morphologies
plays a pivotal role regarding the catalytic efficiency of the material.
Again, the evolution of a morphology or shape of a material highly
depends on the growth and orientation of crystallographic planes.
Among the three low-index lattice planes of CeO2, according
to DFT calculations, the stability order follows the sequence (111)
> (110) > (100), while the activity follows the reverse. In
correlation with surface activities, the formation oxygen vacancies
are also of paramount importance and the associated energy is different
for differently exposed planes of CeO2.8−11 As shown in Figure 1, the different shapes
of CeO2 expose different lattice planes. In the case of
Ce-1, a hexagonal structure, the (111) plane is exposed; for the rectangular
Ce-2, the (110) plane is exposed; and for cuboidal Ce-3, the most
surface-active (100) plane is found to be exposed. To minimize surface
energy of the material, the formation of most stable exposed facet,
(111) is highly favored. The individual TEM images of different shapes
of different samples are also included in Figure S2. Performing the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm
study and determining Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area of the CeO2 materials of different shapes, the Ce-3
nanostructures are found to possess the highest surface area of 897
cm2/g among all (Figure 2). The respective isotherms of Ce-1 and Ce-2 are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S3),
and the details are summarized in Table 1. The addition of more amount of PVP during
synthesis of Ce-3 than that of in Ce-1 (5.04 times) and Ce-2 (2.52
times) may have played a vital role in making cuboidal CeO2 a porous one upon evaporation and providing higher surface area
than the rest two. CeO2 has a fluorite structure and three
commonly observed CeO2 facets, (100), (110), and (111).
The coordination states of the surface cation (Ce4+) and
anion (O2–) differ on each surface. Generally, in
CeO2, the coordination numbers of Ce and O are 8 and 4,
respectively. However, depending on the formation or predominant exposure
of different facets, surface defects are developed. Reportedly,22 for Ce4+, the coordination numbers
are 7, 6, and 6 for (111), (100), and (110), respectively, and for
anions, they are 3, 2, and 3, respectively. The different surface
atom arrangements and degrees of surface-coordinative unsaturation
of the cations and anions lead to the differences in oxygen vacancy
formation energy, interaction strength with surface adsorbates, and
different surface areas. Though the matter is still under debate,
recently, a strong correlation between the surface area and the number
and size of surface defects are suggested involving classic Weibull
statistics.23 The appreciable high surface
area of Ce-3 is
definitely a boosting parameter behind its superior catalytic activity.24 The growth of preferential planes controls the
formation of different shapes of nanocrystals.25 The formation of exposed facets with higher surface energies
may provide the active sites for catalytic reactions. The surface
energies play an important part in the controlled synthesis of different
shapes. Here, the desired shape is obtained using PVP as a surfactant.
Tuning the amount of PVP in the reaction mixture, the formation of
cubical CeO2 is obtained instead of its intrinsic hexagonal
shape with exposed {111} facet. The change in the amount of PVP is
found to be highly influential in formation of CeO2 nanocrystals.
Initially, the NO3– ions from the precursor
to the solution react strongly with (100) planes which results in
anisotropic growth of (110) crystal planes. Here, PVP plays an important
role by preferentially interacting with the (111) plane to (100).
With the increase in the concentration of PVP in the reaction mixture,
the preferential interaction of the PVP molecules with the ceria 001
planes slows the growth of {001} facets relative to {111} faces, leading
to the formation of cube-like structures in Ce-3. It is reported that
the cube-like structures of CeO2 with exposed (100) planes
contain higher oxygen defects which is a key factor behind the better
catalytic activity. The percentages of exposed {100} facets of Ce-1
(27%), Ce-2 (32%), and Ce-3 (78%) are determined from their corresponding
morphological characteristics. Oxygen vacancy is inversely proportional
to the crystallite size of the material.26 Surface catalytic activity also depends on the lattice strain of
the material. With the increase in lattice strain, catalytic activity
increases. It can enhance the performance of the catalyst by decreasing
the strength of the metal–oxygen bond.27 In Table 2, it is
seen that for Ce-3, the crystallite size is lowest, while the lattice
strain is highest. It concurs with the better performance of Ce-3
than Ce-1 and Ce-2 toward MB degradation.

Spectroscopic
Analysis
The prepared CeO2 materials are then
spectroscopically analyzed to investigate their
catalytic performances. Figure 3a presents the UV–visible absorption characteristics
of Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3 where a bathochromic shift is observed for
Ce-3. The shifting of absorption edge to longer wavelength often has
a correlation to alternation in the band gap of the respective material.28 The band gap energies of the CeO2 materials of different shapes were then obtained by plotting Schuster–Kubelka–Munk
absorption function, (αhν)1/n against the photon energy (hν) according
to eq 2 2  where A is a proportionality constant, h is Planck’s constant, n (n = 2 here for direct transition) is the frequency of vibration (hence hν is photon energy), and α is an absorption
coefficient. The band gaps are determined from the straight line x-intercept as presented in Figure 3b, showing that the band gaps are 3.17, 3.08,
and 1.93 eV for Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3, respectively. In general, the
band gap of CeO2 is ≥3 eV, while in cuboidal CeO2, Ce-3, the band gap is found to be highly reduced. The greater
oxygen vacancies in Ce-3 result in narrowing band gap and thus increase
the light absorption of the Ce-3, which is simultaneously found to
be more efficient toward MB degradation than Ce-1 and Ce-2. The characteristic
major UV–visible peak of CeO2 is seen at 363 nm
in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 (a) UV–vis
spectroscopy and (b) Schuster–Kubelka–Munk
absorption function of CeO2 nanostructures, showing the
band gap energies of different shapes of ceria.

A hump-like absorption peak around 640 nm for Ce-3 corresponds
to
its narrow band gap too [Figure 3a]. Oxygen vacancy has also a strong influence in narrowing
of band gap in CeO2. The presence of oxygen vacancies is
confirmed using PL spectroscopy in Figure 4 using excitation wavelength 320 nm. The
formation of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 is represented by
Kroger–Vink equation,29, where Oxo is the O2– ion on the oxygen lattice site. CeCex and CeCe′ are Ce4+ and
Ce3+, respectively, and  is doubly charged oxygen vacancy
and releases two free electrons. These free electrons are captured
by Ce4+ and become Ce3+ ions. The resulted oxygen
vacancies generating Ce3+ ions lead to a lattice distortion
which has a direct correlation with the narrowing of band gap of the
sensing material. Reportedly, the emission energy is 3.0–3.38
eV for the de-excitation of the electrons to the valence band (VB)
in cerium oxides. The PL emissions are thus expected to be the transition
from the 4f band of Ce to the 2p band of O, and the emission peaks
ranging from 350 to 575 nm, observed in Figure 4, are assigned to the results of defects
including oxygen vacancies.30−32 The surface reactivity of CeO2 nanostructures can also
be warranted in the light of their PL spectroscopic analysis. In Figure 4, the emission peaks
for all the samples, Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3, were found to be near the
same region and the order of separation efficiency of photoexcited
holes and electrons was found to be Ce-3 > Ce-2 > Ce-1. The
energy gap between the VB and conduction band (CB) is different for
different facets. The electronic structure, especially the oxygen
vacancies, determines the efficiency of photon absorption. The increase
in catalytic activity of cuboidal CeO2, that is, Ce-3,
may be assigned to the charge separation efficiency between an electron
and hole pair.33 Because the PL emission
spectra deal with the recombination of excited electrons and holes,
a higher PL intensity indicates a higher recombination rate of electron–hole
pairs under the irradiation. In Figure 4, Ce-1 and Ce-2 possessed much higher intensity indicating
the fastest recombination rate of electrons and holes in the materials,
while for Ce-3, the PL emission intensity is highly decreased. It
supports the better catalytic efficiency of cubical ceria. As discussed
previously, the high oxygen vacancies present in Ce-3 facilitate the
charge carrier localization and hence prolonged separation by trapping
at energy levels close to the conduction or VBs. As a consequence,
the lifetime of the electron–hole separation is increased.
In support of the PL study, Raman spectroscopic analyses also site
justification for the better catalytic performance of Ce-3 than Ce-1
and Ce-2, presented in Figure 5 where the characteristic band around 460 cm–1 is observed for all the CeO2 samples. The 460 cm–1 band is indexed to the Raman-active vibrational mode
(F2g) of the FCC structure. It arises because of a symmetrical
stretching vibration of the oxygen atoms around cerium ions.34 The higher full width at half-maxima and lower
intensity of the Raman peak at 460 cm–1 for Ce-3
are associated with smaller crystallite size which is also consistent
with the crystallite size calculation from XRD (Figure S1). The decrease in the intensity for cuboidal CeO2 and shift toward lower frequency (inset right down Figure 5) may be corroborated
as a result of asymmetry induced by randomly oriented oxygen vacancies,
which in turn increases the catalytic activity. A weak band around
600 cm–1 (inset right up Figure 5) belongs to defect-induced (D) mode of CeO2 nanostructures. Reportedly,35 the
ratio of the intensities of the D and F2g bands, that is, ID/IF2g values, bears
a directly proportional relation with oxygen vacancies. Here, the
greater values of ID/IF2g of Ce-3 than those of Ce-2 and Ce-1 support again
the presence of higher oxygen vacancies in cuboidal ceria nanostructures.
To envisage the enhanced electron–hole separation and catalytic
activity of the materials, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was performed. Figure 6a–c shows the core-level Ce 3d spectra of Ce-1, Ce-2, and
Ce-3, respectively. They show the characteristic peaks of Ce3+ at 885.7, 899, and 904.3 eV and the other peaks at 882.2, 901.1,
and 916.1 eV, could be assigned to the +4 oxidation state of CeO2.36 The materials are found to
contain the mix valence states. In FCC-type CeO2 nanostructures,
a Ce4+ ion is always surrounded by eight O2– ions.37 As reported by Voskanyan et al.,
the existence of the oxygen vacancies and the accompanying Ce3+ reduces the coordination number of cerium from eight to
seven which causes the change in the Ce–O bond length and overall
lattice constant. Their study reveals a quantifiable approach regarding
the XPS results showing that CeO2 containing higher percentage
(34.9%) of Ce3± ions shows better catalytic activity.
In our case, the cuboidal CeO2 [Figure 6c] is calculated to have much higher percentage
of Ce3+ (∼32%) than rectangular (∼16.54%)
and hexagonal (∼14.01%) CeO2 nanostructures, as
presented in Figure 6b,a and respectively. XPS profiles of O 1s are presented in Figure 7 where two Gaussian
peaks represent a low binding energy peak at ∼531 eV (lattice
oxygen) and a high binding energy peak at ∼533 eV (chemisorbed
oxygen). Chemisorbed oxygen is directly proportional to the oxygen
vacancies.38−41 Here, in Figure 7a,b, the representative plot of chemisorbed oxygen
of Ce-1 and Ce-2 are 10.17 and 13.03%, respectively, while it is greater
for Ce-3 (29.53%). Therefore, besides the appreciable percentage of
Ce3+, a greater amount of chemisorbed oxygen species reconfirms
the evolution of higher oxygen vacancies in Ce-3, making it more potential
toward superior catalytic activity than Ce-1 and Ce-2.

Catalysis
As discussed in the catalytic
activity test, photocatalytic degradation of MB was performed deploying
Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3 under irradiation with UV light, as shown in Figure 8a–c. Figure 8a,b shows the catalytic
performance of Ce-1 and Ce-2 for degradation of MB at pH∼3
under the UV light irradiation of wavelength ∼253 nm. The peak
intensity at 663 nm does not change significantly even after 200 min
of UV light irradiation for both the cases. In Figure 8c, the excellent photo catalytic performance
of Ce-3 is observed resulting in complete degradation of MB within
175 min. The same set of catalytic experiments was performed under
dark using catalysts and without using catalysts. The corresponding
results are presented in Figures 9 and 10, respectively. The enhanced
catalytic performance of Ce-3 than Ce-1 and Ce-2 is explained on the
basis of different electronic configurations which is the key factor
behind the rapid degradation of MB. It is already mentioned and discussed
that the greater oxygen vacancies in Ce-3 may have decreased the gap
between VB and CB. Thus, in the presence of UV light, the electrons
of Ce-3 are easily being excited to the CB from the valence band to
react with the surface O2 and H2O of CeO2 to generate superoxide anions (O2•–) and hydroxyl ions (OH•) respectively which are
responsible for degradation of MB. The photodegradation mechanism
of MB over the different facets of CeO2 is mainly governed
by the surface reactivity of different facets. Reportedly, two pathways
of photodegradation of MB may be proposed.19 Under the photo-excitation of the VB, electrons hop to the band
gap, CB, generating holes in the VB. Now, these holes upon reaction
with water molecules, or hydroxide ions, will generate OH•. These radicals cause the degradation process MB.42 Additionally, the oxygen vacancies associated with metal-oxide
nanoparticles are also held responsible indirectly for the degradation.
The availability of oxygen vacancies plays the key role behind the
adsorption of water molecules as oxygen atom creates two bridging
OH– groups per initial vacancy, resulting in a transfer
of proton to that water molecule. Therefore, oxygen vacancies in the
CeO2 structures can be assigned as the active sites for
water dissociation. Therefore, oxygen vacancy is directly proportional
to MB degradation. Again, oxygen vacancy on different facets of CeO2 is different. According to XPS, PL, and Raman spectroscopic
results, it is very much evident that cube-like Ce-3 nanomaterial
bearing exposed (100) facets contain the greater oxygen vacancies
than Ce-2 and Ce-1. As discussed previously,
according to DFT calculations,43,44 the required amount
of energy to form oxygen vacancies on (111) is greater than that on
(110) and (100).45 Subsequently, the facet
bears more oxygen vacancy and will cause better degradation of MB.
Thus, being governed by the availability of oxygen vacancies, the
experimentally proved efficiency of different facets of CeO2 follows the order (100) > (110) > (111). Thus, CeO2 having more exposed (100) will show better photodegradation of MB.
Here, cube-like Ce-3 nanostructures bearing the predominantly exposed
(100) facet shows better photodegradation efficiency than Ce-2 and
Ce-1. In order to understand the photodegradation rate of MB in the
presence and absence of CeO2, we have plotted the relative
concentration (Ct/C0) against the UV irradiation time in Figure 11a. We have found
that the complete discoloration of MB in the presence of UV light
takes place exponentially with a first-order rate equation with a
calculated kinetic rate constant (κ) of 1.21 × 10–2 min–1. To understand the stability of Ce-3 without
losing its activity, we conducted three consecutive cycles without
further addition of the sample which is shown in Figure 11b. It shows that the photocatalytic
efficiency of the sample remains almost the same after three consecutive
cycles which indicates the high stability of the Ce-3 sample. As the
catalytic efficiency remains almost constant after each cycle, it
may be applied many times in the textile industry for the purification
of MB contaminated water. The proposed mechanism is as follows

Besides the degradation of
MB, it is very much important to envisage the corresponding degradation
pathway of the same under the catalytic condition. The mass spectra
before and after MB degradation is presented in Figure 11a,b, respectively. The decolorized
solution, decreased peak intensity of MB, and the appearances of new
peaks of different molecular weights (m/z ratios) in post-degradation mass spectra reconfirm the photodegradation
of MB. Corresponding to the respective molecular weights, found in
post degradation spectra Figure 11b a plausible set of compounds are identified.19 The degraded fragmented moieties, providing
a plausible degradation mechanism of MB according to their decrease
in molecular weight, are included in Figure S4. For better manifestation of
the developed catalyst, Ce-3, a comparative analysis is presented
in Table S1, showing the MB degradation
efficiency of different CeO2 based materials (Figure 12).

Conclusions
An environmentally benign
synthesis method of CeO2 nanoparticles is reported highlighting
the contribution of PVP as an additive behind the formation of the
most surface-reactive {100} facet which results in cube-like CeO2 structures of high surface area (∼900 cc/g). Tailoring
the crystallographic structures of CeO2, narrowing of band
gap upto 1.93 eV is achieved and the oxygen vacancies are also spectroscopically
investigated which resulted in a notable change in the corresponding
catalytic activity toward the MB degradation. Besides the development
of an undoped CeO2 material for MB photodegradation with
appreciable efficiency, the effect of different facets of CeO2 is thoroughly studied for the same.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate [(NH4)2Ce(NO3)6,≥98.5%] is purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PVP ≥99.8% and ethylene glycol (EG) (anhydrous, HOCH2CH2OH, ≥99.8%) were procured from Loba Chemie Pvt.
Ltd., India. Deionized water was used throughout the synthesis and
washing. For photocatalysis, MB is purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
the reagents are of analytical grade.

Methods
In a typical
procedure, CeO2 was synthesized
via the precipitation method taking ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate as
the precursor material. Solution of (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (0.009 mol %) was prepared in 30 mL EG, and
it was kept under a vigorous stirring condition till the solution
became clear. Then, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.26 g PVP were added to the solution
differently and marked as Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3, respectively. After
the addition of PVP, the solution was refluxed at 190 °C for
4 h under a vigorous stirring condition. For each case to collect
the sample, the mixture was centrifuged and washed with deionized
water. Finally, the collected samples were dried overnight under vacuum.

Characterization Techniques
The structural morphology of
the synthesized materials was investigated
using high-resolution TEM (model: TECNAI G2 30ST; manufacturer: FEI
Company, The Netherlands). Crystallographic characteristics of the
materials were examined using an X-ray diffractometer with the Cu
Kα line (model: D8 ADVANCE; manufacturer: Bruker Corporation,
MA, USA) and XPS (model: PHI 5000 Versa probe II XPS system) having
a source of Al Kα and charge neutralizer at room temperature.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the materials
are measured using Quantachrome Instruments version3.0. The base pressure
was maintained at 6 × 10–10 mbar with an energy
resolution of 0.6 eV. The Raman spectroscopic analysis was performed
using Renishaw Raman System 1000 calibrated using a silicon standard.
Mass spectroscopic results were obtained using liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (Waters 2695, USA) spectrometer.

Catalytic Activity Test
With the decrease in absorbance
of the target analyte, MB was monitored using UV–vis spectroscopy
where the peak at 663 nm was the characteristic peak of MB. The comparative
photocatalytic degradation of MB using Ce-1, Ce-2, and Ce-3 had been
carried out using an 8 W UV lamp of wavelength 253 nm. Three different
samples were mixed with MB in a 1:1 ratio (4.6 μM each) separately
in a continuously stirring condition for 30 min in a quartz cuvette,
maintaining pH ≈ 3. Then, the cuvette was placed at ∼2
cm apart from the UV light source and the UV light was turned on.
The absorbance of MB was measured at a certain interval of time in
a UV–vis spectrophotometer and the absorbance at 663 nm was
monitored for each sample to measure the comparative photocatalytic
degradation efficiency. Getting the complete degradation of MB using
the Ce-3 sample, we added the same amount of MB (4.6 μM) to
the solution mixture after completing every cycle without further
addition of our sample for recyclability test.
