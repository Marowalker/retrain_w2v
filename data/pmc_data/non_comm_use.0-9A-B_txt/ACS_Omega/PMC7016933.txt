Skin burn wounds
are a crucial issue that could reduce life quality.
Although numerous effective
skin products have invaded the biomedical market, most of them still
demonstrate some limitations regarding their porosity, swelling and
degradation behaviors, antibacterial properties, and cytotoxicity.
Thus, the aim of this study is to fabricate novel trilayered asymmetric
porous scaffolds that can mimic the natural skin layers. In particular,
the fabricated scaffold constitutes an upper electrospun chitosan–poly(vinyl
alcohol) layer and a lower xerogel layer, which is made of effective
skin extracellular matrix components. Both layers are fixed together
using fibrin glue as a middle layer. The results of this study revealed
promising scaffold swelling capability suitable for absorbing wound
exudates, followed by a constant degradable weight over time, which
is appropriate for a burn wound environment. Scanning electron microscopy
images revealed an average pore diameter in the range of 138.39–170.18
nm for the cross-linked electrospun mats and an average pore size
of 2.29–30.62 μm for the fabricated xerogel layers. This
further provided an optimum environment for fibroblast migration and
proliferation. The electrospun nanofibrous layer was examined for
its antibacterial properties and showed expressive complete bacterial
inhibition against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains (log reduction = 3 and 2.70, respectively). Next,
mouse embryonic fibroblast cytotoxicity and migration rate were investigated
against the developed asymmetrical composite to assess its biocompatibility.
Tissue culture experiments demonstrated significant cell proliferation
and migration in the presence of the constructed scaffold (P < 0.0001). A complete wound closure was observed in
vitro in the presence of the three scaffold asymmetrical layers against
the mouse embryonic fibroblast. The results of this study proved superior
biological characteristics of the innovative asymmetrical composite
that could further replace the burned or damaged skin layers with
promising potential for clinical applications.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Skin plays a substantial
role in the protection process against
the surrounding external environment. Loss of healthy skin integrity
leads to a lack of the physiological homeostasis of the whole body.
In the past decade, burn wounds were increased dramatically, with
about 180 000 global deaths annually. The majority of these
burn cases took place in low- and middle-income countries, according
to the World Health Organization.1 Moreover,
the Center for Disease Control in the USA determined the annual statistics
in the USA to about 1.1 million people who experienced burn injuries
and demanded intensive medical care. Roughly, 50 000 of these
patients required hospitalization and 20 000 underwent major
burns with around 25% loss of their skin body surface. Unfortunately,
this in most cases could lead to disability-adjusted life years and
cause of death. Almost 4500 patients with severe burns are most likely
to die and 10 000 could die because of burn-related infections.
These data are alarming for the distressing consequences of burn injury
burden to patients and the responsible authorities worldwide.2

Chronic burn wounds, especially the third-degree
burns, have more
harmful consequences on affected patients than other wound types.
This difference is mainly related to their specific related three
distinctive zones, which are known as Jackson’s burn wound
zones.3 The first zone is the coagulation
zone, which experiences the maximum point of tissue damage with permanent
loss of its tissue due to the coagulation of the constitutive proteins.
After that, it is followed by the zone of stasis, which is encircling
the coagulation zone and acts as a salvageable.3,4 Thus,
effective management of burns is important here to help increasing
tissue perfusion and hinder any possibility of irreversible tissue
loss. The third outward zone is the zone of hyperemia, in which the
tissue perfusion is high and tissue repair is constantly taking place
in the absence of unfavorable factors like sepsis or hypoperfusion.
These zones are three dimensional, and the most critical one is the
zone of stasis, as inappropriate resuscitation would increase the
severity of the burn wound.3 The perfect
scaffold should connect the living tissues that lay on the burn wound
edges and act as a bridge for epithelial migration. Besides that,
it should protect against bacterial pathogens and absorb wound exudates.
Meanwhile, it must be biodegradable, biocompatible, and comprise an
optimum microspore structure.5

From
old days, applications of saline-soaked gauzes and split-thickness
or full-thickness skin grafts have been the golden standard techniques
according to the underlying burn wound condition. The primary aim
of burnt area treatment is to avoid infection and provide a rapid
healing process in as shorter time as possible. However, those conventional
methods may display unpleasant outcomes that can result in late wound
closure and high bacterial invasion.6−8 Several artificial skin
products have invaded the market, either by combining with the standard
grafting procedure or being embedded with cultured cells to enhance
the treatment of chronic burn wounds. Nevertheless, such complex biological
skin equivalents result in improved burn wound healing; however, they
demonstrate a wide range of drawbacks in terms of cytotoxicity, invasion
of pathogens, and their high cost of production.9,10

Biopolymers are being used in diverse biomedical applications,
as they provide a favorable and natural environment for cell proliferation
and migration. Moreover, it is critical to utilize biodegradable and
biocompatible components when it comes to the fabrication of artificial
skin substitutes alongside seeding of the main skin cell types (e.g.,
fibroblasts and keratinocytes), which can result in rapid skin regeneration
in case of burn wounds. Numerous experiments have been conducted on
the potential biomaterial-based scaffolds in skin tissue engineering.11 One contemporary study has fabricated a porous
collagen scaffold using different variants of lyophilized type I collagen
solution; meanwhile, different ratios of a collagen–agarose
mixture solution have been used to fabricate the other three comparable
scaffolds.

The morphological characterization showed a microporous
structure
with a porosity of 99.15% for the collagen scaffold and more than
98% in all other tested variants. The scaffolds showed considerable
biocompatibility and biodegradability when tested on fibroblast cell
lines with excellent cell morphology and viability with enhanced structural
properties upon the addition of agarose. The previous examples could
explain the potential of collagen-based scaffolds in the engineering
of various organs including the skin.12

In this study, polysaccharides [chitosan (Cs) and alginate]
and
proteins [collagen, gelatin, elastin (El.), and fibrinogen] were used
due to their high cytocompatibility and biodegradability, nontoxicity,
and antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties.12−17 These biopolymers involve proteins such as collagen type I, which
demonstrates around 80–85% of the skin extracellular matrix
(ECM) and provides favorable cell interactive properties. Elastin
represents around 1–2% of the total dermal proteins and exhibits
a vital role in providing unique physiological elasticity for several
connective tissues including skin, lungs, and blood vessels.18 Fibrin glue, which plays a definitive role in
the blood coagulation cascade, besides its golden ability to act as
a hemostatic barrier, serves as a scaffold for cell migration and
has been used as a tissue adhesive for a variety of human surgical
procedures.19−21 Gelatin illustrates significant properties that are
close to those of collagen type I since it contains the typical amino
acids present in collagen, besides its ability to form a gel at decreased
temperatures in the range of 20–30 °C.13,22−24

In addition, polysaccharides including alginate
and chitosan have
been used in this research, as they are naturally occurring polysaccharides
and display numerous characteristics associated with their hemostatic,
antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, antifungal, analgesic, and
hypocholesterolemic properties.15,25−30 Moreover, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was used as a synthetic polymer
in this study to facilitate the electrospinning process, besides its
various significant and promising characteristics including elevated
degrees of swellability, elasticity, a rubberlike structure, bioadhesiveness,
noncarcinogenicity, and ease of handling properties. In addition,
PVA is nontoxic due to its very limited acute oral toxicity.31−33

According to the unique properties of the utilized proteins
and
polysaccharides, a smart combination of these components would result
in the rapid healing of burn wounds by providing an imitative environment
of normal skin layers that could support cell migration and proliferation.

2 Results and Discussion
The engineered design of the
trilayered asymmetric porous biocomposite
scaffold is illustrated in Figure 1. This figure shows the composition of the human skin
layers and their thickness, which was found to differ from one site
to another and mainly based on the specific function of each layer.
It is worth mentioning that several studies reported on the average
epidermal thickness to be 0.08–0.1 mm and the average dermal
thickness to be 1.5 mm.34−36 However, the whole engineered
scaffold prepared in this study was optimized to a thickness of 0.4
mm to facilitate the uptake capacity of the recipient burnt skin region.37,38

2.1 Morphological Characterization of Cs/PVA Nanofibrous
Scaffolds
SEM micrographs of non-cross-linked and cross-linked
Cs (2%)–PVA (10%) and Cs (3%)–PVA (10%) showed an optimum
morphological structure at the nanoscale regarding their random orientation,
smooth surface, and bead-free structure, as shown in Figure 2. The average diameter of cross-linked
Cs (2%)–PVA (10%) and Cs (3%)–PVA (10%) was considerably
higher than that of the non-cross-linked ones. The mean diameter of
Cs (2%)–PVA (10%) increased from 131.01 to 138.39 nm, and the
mean fiber diameter of Cs (3%)–PVA (10%) increased from 155
to 170.18 nm.

their (2D) typical histogram (the average fiber diameter is 170.18
nm; n = 50).

This might be attributed to the dispersion of glutaraldehyde molecules
into the nanofiber structure homogeneously during the cross-linking
process that resulted in shifting the fiber diameter to higher values
without forming beads.39 Furthermore, Cs
(3%)–PVA (10%) showed a significant increase in fiber diameter
than Cs (2%)–PVA (10%), which was related to the increased
Cs concentration that led to the higher viscosity of the electrospun
polymeric solution by raising the polymeric chain entanglement and
affected the mean size of the fabricated nanofibers. PVA was chosen
to achieve a typical nanofibrous scaffold due to its numerous perfect
properties such as nontoxicity, biodegradability, biocompatibility,
nonionogenic properties, and primary antimicrobial properties for
skin tissue regeneration. Since PVA is a nonionogenic polymer, it
enhances the charge density of the blended solution and improves the
stretch forces of the ejected jet, leading to the formation of smooth,
ultrafine, and defect-free nanofibers.40

2.2 Morphological Characterization of Xerogel
Scaffolds
During the fabrication of the xerogel scaffolds,
two similar formulas were used: Alg. (3%). Gel. (6%). El. (11%) (abbreviated
to X1) and Alg. (3%). Colg. (0.3%). El. (11%) (abbreviated to X2)
at a fixed ratio of (3:7:1.5) (w/w). Elastin was used to provide natural
elasticity to the fabricated xerogel scaffolds that could mimic the
normal skin elasticity, as elastin represents around 1% of the dermis
components and is responsible for the unique elasticity of the normal
healthy skin. SEM morphological characteristics of each xerogel sample
are presented in Figure 3. For X1, the sample showed quite different morphology compared to
that for X2 with a heterogeneous structure and a greater average of
pore size (30.62 μm), suggesting that the internal xerogel morphology
is affected by its specific composition. However, X2 represented a
spherical, macroporous shape with a smooth surface and an average
pore size of 2.29 μm.

2.3 Swelling and Degradation Capacity
The swelling
and degradation capability of the fabricated cross-linked
NFs and xerogels using the phosphate buffer solution (PBS) immersion
method are illustrated in Figure 4. For NFs, it has been observed that swelling behavior
of cross-linked PVA at 15 mg reached its peak altitude at 332% after
2 h of swelling and then decreased to 268% after 24 h. However, Cs-PVA
NF mats showed a considerable decrease in swelling behavior for Cs(2%)–PVA(10%)
15 mg of 99.83%, which slightly increased to 99.89% after 24 h. Moreover,
Cs(3%)–PVA(10%) 15 mg exhibited a minor swelling increase of
0.16% after 2 h and then the percentage was lowered to 0.09% after
24 h, indicating the very similar water uptake behavior of Cs at two
close concentrations (2 and 3%).

and xerogel scaffolds.

All samples were significantly comparable (P <
0.0001). (2A) Xerogel swelling capacity (P < 0.0001).
(2B) Xerogel degradation capacity (P < 0.01).

Examined NF scaffolds at a lower weight of 10 mg
demonstrated the
same swelling behavior but with lower values due to a decrease in
polymer contents. The stable manner of water uptake and mass loss
of the Cs-PVA NFs mats is due to the chemical interaction between
the Cs amine groups and PVA polar hydroxyl groups and the aldehyde
groups of glutaraldehyde, which ends up by stable and firmly mechanical
features that could control swelling and degradation ability.41

Clearly, samples that contained a higher
Cs content of 3% expressed
a lower degradation rate and slightly higher swelling percentages
compared to samples made of 2% Cs. Also, the visibly elevated swellable
and degradable manner of single PVA mats was noticed. These two observations
could be related to the higher cross-linking density that occurred
with the presence of or increased Cs content, due to the more chemical
cross-linking between Cs amine groups and GA, which slowed the depolymerization
state of NFs containing Cs compared to individual PVA mats.42

On the other hand, fabricated xerogels
were tested for their swelling
and degradation behavior to evaluate their mechanical properties to
be further applied to burn wound areas (Figure 4). After 2 h of xerogel immersion in PBS,
swelling behavior of X1 xerogel reached up to 650%, while X2 xerogel
showed a greater swelling manner that reached its peak after 6 h (952%)
and then roughly decreased to 949% after 24 h. Due to the remarkable
capacity, X2 xerogel expressed very low degradation rate after 2 and
4 days (16 and 30%), which then reached up to 85% after 8 days compared
to that of X1 xerogel, which was completely softened and fragmented
in the stimulated media and totally degraded (100%) after 8 days.
This could be explained by the presence of alginate as an elementary
material in both xerogels, which contained Ca2+ ions. When
alginate-based xerogels were immersed in PBS media containing monovalent
ions such as Na+, these ions could compete with original
Ca2+ ions and start to degrade the xerogels over time due
to an ion exchange reaction between Ca2+ ions and Na+ ions.43 Besides that, it is recognized
that collagen, gelatin, and elastin could be readily degraded by proteolytic
enzymes.44

Surprisingly, collagen
is known for its weak mechanical properties;45,46 however, as mentioned above, X2, which included (Alg. Colg. El.),
expressed a low degradation rate, indicating that X2 xerogel is well
stabilized by physical cross-linking between functional groups of
alginate and collagen.47 Eventually, low
degradation behavior of fabricated NFs and high rate in xerogels made
the prepared designed scaffolds ideal in enhancing burn wound healing,
as the high degradable rate of xerogels would help their vital components
to be easily transported to the burnt area and accelerate the healing
process by the formation of new skin tissue. At the same time, lower
degradation behavior of prepared NFs is favorable, since the NF layer
mats express antibacterial properties, which are crucial in preventing
the bacterial invasion to the burnt area. This guarantees the ability
of this layer to cover and preserve the burnt area until reaching
significant healing.

2.4 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) Spectroscopy
Functional and chemical groups of the
applied pure components and
blended nanofibers were investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy. Figure 5 demonstrates the
pure Cs and PVA spectrum along with the electrospun non-cross-linked
Cs and cross-linked (2%)–PVA (10%) and Cs (3%)–PVA (10%)
NFs. Pure Cs absorption peaks of O–H and N–H stretching
vibrations were identified at 3433 cm–1. In addition,
the C–H stretching was observed at 2875 cm–1. The band at 1654 cm–1 is attributed to amide
I, while the band at 1592 cm–1 is associated with
the N–H bending (amide II) and at 1376 cm–1 to amide III. The typical weak peak of the amino group was observed
at 1255 cm–1, which was linked to the O–H
bending vibration. The Cs saccharide and wagging structure were identified
at 1153 and 895 cm–1, respectively.48,49

along with their fabricated composite NFs (1B and 1A). (2) FT-IR absorbed
peaks of fabricated xerogels: (2B) X1 xerogel and (2A) X2 xerogel.

Likewise, characteristics peaks of pure PVA were
confirmed by FT-IR
spectroscopy by determining the O–H stretching vibrations observed
at 3440 and 1430 cm–1, which were attributed to
the O–H stretching and bending vibration of the PVA hydroxyl
group, respectively. The stretching vibration of the asymmetric vibration
of the CH2 group was observed at 2923 cm–1 (alkyl groups). Moreover, PVA C=C stretching was found at
1633 cm–1, while C–O stretching was observed
at 1104 cm–1 and the C–C stretching vibration
was observed at 845 cm–1 (PVA acetate group residues
during its saponification reaction).42 FT-IR
spectra of non-cross-linked and cross-linked Cs (2%)–PVA (10%)
and Cs (3%)–PVA (10%) nanofibers were investigated, and the
typical characteristic peaks are shown in Figure 5.

FT-IR spectra of the fabricated xerogels
showed a shifting of the
three characteristic protein peaks of amide I, II, and III to lower
wavenumber frequencies upon blending of the different xerogel components,
as shown in Figure 5. Moreover, the OH stretching vibration signal becomes broader and
is shifted to higher wavenumbers. Additionally, a slight decrease
of the absorbed alginate carboxylate groups at 1618 and 1467 cm–1 to lower wavenumbers of 1612 and 1461 cm–1, respectively, was observed. Peaks at 1128 cm–1 (X1) and 945 cm–1 (X2) were related to the CN
stretching combined with the NH bending upon mixing of the used xerogel
components together. Also, the alginate acid peak observed at 720
cm–1 was deceased to lower frequencies, while the
pyranose ring peak was shifted to 945 cm–1.50−52

2.5 Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET) Analysis
of Xerogels
The method of Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET)
was used to evaluate the pore area and pore size distribution in the
fabricated xerogel porous networks. Chart 1 shows the isotherm linear plot and the pore
volume distribution of the fabricated xerogels. Apparently, xerogels
exhibited two different types of porosities: mesopores (2–50
nm) and macropores (more than 50 nm), according to IUPAC classification.53 Specifically, X2 xerogel exhibited sharp peaks
between 48.42 and 126.23 nm, indicating the presence of a large number
of mesopores along with a small quantity of macropores. Meanwhile,
X1 displayed a lower quantity of pores identified between 11.13 and
17.68 nm, as well as between 48.44 and 124 nm, demonstrating its mesopores
and macropores. Additionally, the total pore surface area (m2/g) against the pore diameter (nm) of the fabricated xerogels was
determined as follows: as shown in Table 1: X1(1.05 m2/g) and X2 (1.04 m2/g).

2.6 Mechanical Properties
The tensile
strength of fabricated trilayered asymmetric scaffolds was tested
using the Tensile Stage TS-1500-llI instrument. Scaffold mats were
cut into dog-bone-shaped strips and then held by two-sided grips,
and a tensile force was applied. Figure 6 shows the force–displacement curve
of the trilayered asymmetric scaffold, which reveals that the fabricated
scaffold is flexible. In the beginning, the whole scaffold kept extending
up to an applied force of 2.4 newton (N) with a displacement of 3800
μm. The lower xerogel layer (X2) was cracked, while the upper
Cs(3%)–PVA(10%) 15 mg kept elongating until reaching the final
displacement of 6500 μm.

2.7 Antibacterial Activity
of Nanofibrous Scaffolds
Cs antibacterial activity was evaluated
at two concentrations (2
and 3%). The fabricated composite nanofibrous scaffolds were tested
at two different weights (10 mg and 15 mg). Interestingly, NFs composed
of 15 mg of Cs (3%)–PVA (10%) showed a significant activity
against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (log reduction = 3 and 2.70, respectively),
while Cs (2%)–PVA (10%) showed lower activity against both
tested bacterial strains (log reduction = 2.61 for S. aureus and 2.50 for E. coli). Meanwhile, the antibacterial effect of both tested samples was
slightly decreased when tested at the weight of 10 mg. Cs (3%)–PVA
(10%) log reduction value was 2.86 against S. aureus and 2.26 against E. coli, while Cs
(2%)–PVA (10%) expressed a value of 2.45 for S. aureus and 2 for E. coli, as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Antibacterial activity of PVA NFs and Cs-PVA NFs against (A) S. aureus and (B) E. coli at weights of 10 mg and 15 mg. All samples showed a significant
decrease in the number of colonies in comparison to control (P < 0.0001).

Obviously, the number of bacterial colonies decreased with increasing
Cs concentration. These results agree with other comparable published
results54 that showed a significant reduction
rate in bacterial growth upon increasing the surface area of the utilized
Cs nanofibers from 1 to 2.5 cm2. The reduction rate elevated
from 99.93 to 100% in the case of E. coli and from 99.14 to 99.98% in the case of S. aureus, indicating the greater Cs capability against bacterial colonies
at higher concentrations.

The Cs antibacterial activity against
both bacterial strains was
quite different and had a direct association with the assigned bacterial
structure. Generally, Gram-negative bacteria consist of a thin peptidoglycan
cell wall with the absence of teichoic acids and the presence of a
high-permeability outer membrane (lipopolysaccharides, proteins),
which makes them more resistant to antibiotics and more pathogenic.
In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria lack the presence of an outer
membrane but exhibit a thicker peptidoglycan cell wall with the presence
of teichoic acids, which makes them more susceptible to antibiotics.55 Our fabricated Cs-based nanofibers showed greater
bacterial inhibition against S. aureus than against E. coli since Cs is
a polymeric macromolecule and there is an eternal opportunity to pass
to the E. coli intracellular molecules;56 instead, it attaches to its negative outer membrane
surface (specifically to the anionic components; lipopolysaccharides
and proteins) due to its polycationic structure that causes membrane
rupture and leakage of the intracellular components.57

However, PVA is not widely known with its trivial
antibacterial
properties, as noticed in this study and the other contemporary study.58 PVA NFs alone showed more antibacterial activity
against S. aureus than against E. coli, which might be attributed to the expressive
degradation capacity of the Gram-negative bacteria than that of Gram-positive
bacteria, as most PVA degraders are Gram-negative bacteria.59 Apparently, PVA at the low tested weight (10
mg) showed a quite increase in E. coli bacterial growth (−0.09) than at a higher weight that showed
very slight bacterial inhibition (0.04), indicating that E. coli has a significant depolymerization effect
on lower weights of PVA. Likewise, PVA decreased S.
aureus growth at 15 mg (0.37) than at 10 mg (0.2),
indicating the easy degradation behavior of PVA at low weights and
the presence of more alcoholic groups at elevated PVA weights. Table 2 shows the minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration
(MBC) of the Cs-PVA NFs against both bacterial strains.

2.8 Cell Culture Assays
2.8.1 Cytotoxicity Assay
The proliferation
capacity of wild-type (wt) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) on the
prepared electrospun NFs and fabricated xerogels was determined by
the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. The yellow tetrazolium MTT molecule could be
reduced by the active metabolic cells upon the action of dehydrogenase
enzymes and secrete the intracellular purple formazan into the examined
extraction media. In this study, the developed change in the medium
color was determined by spectrophotometric means after 24 and 48 h
for all tested samples.60 PVA nanofibrous
and alginate xerogel mats were used as a positive control for the
tested nanofibrous and xerogel samples, respectively, while seeded
MEFs in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) media
without fetal bovine serum (FBS) were treated as a negative control
and expressed as 100% cell viability.

2.8.1.1 Nanofibrous
Scaffolds
MEF optical
density (OD) on all tested NF samples increased during both assigned
interval times, i.e., 24 and 48 h. This indicates that the wt MEF
cells were metabolically active in the presence of the fabricated
NF and xerogel scaffolds. For NF scaffolds, the difference in cell
proliferation was observed between 24 and 48 h. The percentage increase
in the proliferation rate from 24 to 48 h was observed in both Cs(2%)–PVA
(10%) and Cs(3%)–PVA(10%) NF samples, unlike PVA NFs alone,
which showed less cell viability in 48 h. This might be attributed
to the slower degradation rate of Cs-PVA NFs mats compared to that
of PVA NFs mats alone, as previously mentioned in the biodegradability
study. All examined NF samples ensured significantly their biocompatibility
and nontoxicity (P < 0.0001) toward MEF by demonstrating
the percentage of cell viability above 50% with closer or higher proliferation
values compared to those of the control, as shown in Figure 8.

mat cytotoxicity tested on seeded wt
MEF cells at (A) 24 h and (B) 48 h. The spectrophotometric OD of 570
nm was used. All tested NFs samples expressed significant cell viability
(P < 0.0001).

xerogel scaffolds demonstrated remarkable and great cell viability
rates when incubated for 24 and 48 h. All examined samples showed
a significant elevation in cell reproduction rate (P < 0.0001) compared to the untreated control samples, as shown
in Figure 9. In the
first 24 h, the MEF cell viability rate increased dramatically and
reached 243% in the case of X2 and decreased to (200%) when tested
with X1, in contrast to that of the control (100%). After 48 h, the
metabolic activity of live cells noticeably decreased to 106 and 188.4%
for X1 and X2, respectively. These results were in conformity with
the biodegradable study (Figure 4), which revealed the highly degradable rate of the
xerogel components within 8 days. This could signify the correlation
between the biodegradability of the produced xerogels and cell viability.

Figure 9 MEF cell
viability percentage against the fabricated xerogels:
alginate, X1, and X2 (A) at 24 h and (B) at 48 h. All samples showed
a significant increase in cell viability (P <
0.0001).

As anticipated, the percentage
of cell viability was higher in
the presence of collagen and elastin together, as shown in X2 compared
to the control sample. It is widely known that collagen plays a definitive
and critical role in managing cell biological functions and behaviors,
as it could regulate cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and
differentiation. This is attributed to the existence of three unique
amino acids in collagen that are arranged together in a specific configuration
and direct the proliferation of targeted cells. Most importantly,
the used collagen in this study is type I, which constitutes around
80–85% of fibroblasts; thus, there might be some cell signaling
between the cultured mouse fibroblast cells and the X2 xerogel condition
medium, which is rich in collagen.61−65

Gelatin differs from collagen in its configuration
shape that changes
the recognition sites for cell binding, as it expresses a less ordered
macromolecular structure than collagen. Both molecules own E (glutamate)
or D (aspartate) residues necessary for cell attachment, but collagen
varies from gelatin by having the attracted triple helical GxOGER
sequences (G is glycine; O is hydroxyproline; R is arginine; and x
is hydrophobic, represented by phenylalanine, F). Meanwhile, gelatin
substitutes this highly affinitive molecule by a linear cell adhesive
ligand, RGD. Subsequently, this alters the typical order of cell binding
sites, leading to variation in cell behavior in the presence of each
molecule separately. This explains how X2 xerogel showed high cell
viability (243%) compared to X1 (141.14%) that contained gelatin along
with elastin and alginate.66

Similarly,
as mentioned above, elastin includes about 3–9
short repeated amino acid sequences that regulate it to its determined
arrangement. One study has proven that GAGs could bind to the bovine
tropoelastin C-terminal region, while another study has reported the
tropoelastin cell interactive site to be situated in the central domain
17–18 domain region, more specifically, in the 18-sequence
domain. It has been detected that GAGs and integrins, which are present
on the cell surface, can identify this sequence distinctly from the
total tropoelastin molecule. Since elastin represents around 1–2%
of the total dermis layer, the integration of elastin with collagen
or gelatin enhances the cell viability, as shown in X1 and X2 xerogels.67

2.8.2 In
Vitro Scratch Assay
The NFs
and xerogels along with their individual condition medium were evaluated
for their capability of enhancing MEF cell migration in a 96-well
plate, which is a crucial assessment in this study to comprehensively
determine the samples that could significantly close the wounded area
rapidly.

2.8.2.1 Nanofibrous Scaffolds
Figure 9 shows the artificially
induced wt MEF gap for the negative control sample at 0 h, which showed
a significant cell migration of 35% after 48 h. In contrast, Figure 11 shows Cs(3%)–PVA(10%)
at 15 mg with an expressive cell migration of 45.04%, making it highly
biocompatible and efficient in wound closure compared to both negative
and positive control samples.

The positive control PVA (10%)
NFs are shown in Figure 10 at two examined weights of 10 mg and 15 mg. Surprisingly,
PVA mats at the weight of 10 mg demonstrated very negligible cell
migration (1%), while at a higher PVA weight (15 mg), the cell migration
elevated up to 30.05%, which was very close to the percentage of the
control negative sample, demonstrating the nontoxicity of PVA.68−70 This may be attributed to the low weight of 10 mg used at the beginning,
as PVA is reported to lack the presence of cell binding sites that
encourage the cell migration, while at the higher PVA weights, it
improved the cell migration capacity. These results are in agreement
with the results of the cytotoxicity study that showed higher cell
viability at 15 mg PVA than at 10 mg PVA (Figure 7).

(0 h and 48 h) of
(A) negative control MEFs in DMEM media. (B) PVA (10%) in 10 mg/mL
condition media. (C) PVA (10%) in 15 mg/mL condition media.

Similarly, the same results were observed with
Cs (3%)–PVA
(10%) 10 mg that expressed a wound closure percentage of 4.86% compared
to the Cs(3%)–PVA(10%) 15 mg sample that expressed an elevated
wound closure percentage of 45.04%, as shown in Figure 11. Despite the naturally found polysaccharide properties of
Cs and its mimicking structure for the ECM GAGs along with its numerous
benefits such as biodegradability, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility,
the Cs degree of deacetylation in some cases could affect the cell
migration, as observed during this study. A comparable research study
has observed a rounded shape of adult human bone marrow-derived stem
cells when implanted in pure Cs. DNA investigation of this cell line
revealed a lower DNA content of the examined cells over 3 weeks of
up to 50%, indicating the occurrence of cell death.65 Other study produced Cs gels embedded with rat-muscle-derived
stem cells in β-GP, which demonstrated a similar round shape
when cultured for 4 weeks in vitro and in vivo.62

Figure 11 In vitro scratch assay at 0 and 48 h against (A) Cs(3%)–PVA(10%)
10 mg/mL condition media and (B) Cs(3%)–PVA(10%)15 mg/mL condition
media. (C) Wound closure percentage of all tested nanofibers samples
after 48 h using Image J.

In our study, the NF samples did not show rounded cell morphology
and instead expressed low migration rates in the case of Cs(3%)–PVA(10%)
NFs at low weight (10 mg). This could mainly relate to the high Cs
deacetylation degree (89.9%) that could negatively affect the cultured
cell behavior. More clearly, wt MEF cells were migrated in the presence
of a higher sample weight (15 mg) rather than a lower weight (10 mg),
indicating that the cells were able to migrate just at the elevated
content of PVA-Cs-combined NFs mats since Cs and PVA are polymers
that do not require specific ligands for cell affinity.

2.8.2.2 Xerogel Scaffolds
Figures 12 and 13 show the
induced artificial wound at 0 and 24 h for the produced
X1 and X2, which revealed accelerating wound healing of 65.63 and
80.74% for each one, respectively. This data is in agreement with
the MTT assay results, which identified the highest cell viability
in X2. According to the above-mentioned observation, the addition
of gelatin to collagen significantly decreased the cell viability
and cell migration. Following that, the less specificity of the gelatin
RGD ligand led to lower cell growth and migration compared to collagen
that exhibited higher and more specific binding sites, which aided
in targeting cell growth.66,71 Moreover, Figure 13 shows that numerous
mitotic cells were attached to the established monolayer sheet and
appeared as rounded cells, indicating the healthy state of the cultured
wt MEF cells in both X1 and X2 samples. X2 sample after 48 h shows
migrated cells expressing a spindle-shaped morphology, which resembled
collagen fibers, indicating a cellular reaction between the cells
and collagen matrix. These findings are pointing to cellular interaction
events between collagen-specific integrins and cell migration that
might need further investigation.

2.9 Migration Capability of MEF in the Presence
of the Designed Asymmetrical Trilayered Scaffold
The layers
of the typical trilayered scaffold were chosen based on the efficacy
of the characterized nanofibrous and xerogel samples, separately.
At this stage, Cs(3%)−PVA(10%) 15 mg NF mats and the X2 mat-containing
sample (Alg. Colg. EL) were selected to act as upper and lower layers,
consequently. These two asymmetrical layers in morphology and function
were fixed together using fibrin glue, ending up with three different
structural layers. Collagen, gelatin, elastin, and fibrin glue possess
cell-binding-specific ligands that could interact and direct cell
migration. This was observed for the wt MEF cell migration capacity,
which improved when tested against the asymmetric trilayered scaffold
compared to the individual tested scaffold layers. To the best of
our knowledge, there is no reported study on the influence of fibrin
glue on wt MEF cells regarding their growth and migration; instead,
multiple studies have reported its effect on other examined cell lines
including bone marrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells, vascular
smooth muscle cells, and adipose-derived stem cells.72−74 Apparently, the migrated cell morphology in Figure 14 after 48 h represents the healthy spindle-extended
morphology of the newly migrated cells, which covered the artificial
wounded gap without experiencing cell stress or death according to
their healthy morphology.

arrow indicates complete healing.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we successfully
developed an innovative, highly
biocompatible, and biodegradable asymmetric trilayered scaffold for
skin regeneration. The scaffold expressed unique antibacterial properties
with log reduction values of 3 and 2.70 in the case of 15 mg Cs (3%)–PVA
(10%) (as an upper layer) against both S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. Stable
and high swelling behavior over time was observed for the upper layer
15 mg Cs(3%)–PVA(10%) (99.98%), with a degradable rate of 14%
compared to PVA(10%) and Cs(2%)–PVA(10%) tested samples. A
similar observation was noticed in the case of the X2 xerogel sample,
which showed swelling behavior of up to 949% and a degradation rate
of 85% after 24 h compared to the X1 sample, which presented 441 and
100%, respectively. This optimum swelling capability is essential
in absorbing wound exudates, especially in the first 24 h, besides
the great biodegradability over time of the sample. Furthermore, NF
average diameter and xerogel pore size distribution were determined
using SEM and BET. The upper Cs(3%)–PVA (10%) showed an NF
average diameter of 170.18 nm, while X2 expressed a pore size distribution
in the range of 48.42–126.23 nm with a pore volume of 0.00188
cm3/g. The findings of this study showed the capability
of the fabricated polymer-based ECM artificial composite in favoring
and supporting fibroblast migration and proliferation without significant
cytotoxicity. This was demonstrated in vitro when the MEF cell migration
capacity leveled up to 95% compared to the control sample, which showed
only 35% of cell migration after 48 h. Since the majority of the used
components resemble or naturally exist in the skin ECM, they tremendously
assist and reinforce the induced in vitro artificial wound healing.
The reported results are inspiring in the domain of skin tissue engineering,
making the created asymmetric composite ideal and superior for promoting
skin regeneration after chronic skin burns.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Chitosan (Cs) of low molecular
weight (89.9% degree of dealkylation) was purchased from Primex ehf,
Chitoclear, Iceland. Glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) was
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Sodium alginate (Protanal
LF 10/60 NF) was supplied by FMC BioPolymer, Philadelphia. Gelatin
was purchased from Honeywell Fluka Research Chemicals, Germany. MTT
reagent (3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Serva Electrophoresis,
Heidelberg, Germany. Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was obtained
from Lonza, Switzerland. Fibrinogen type I-S (65–85% protein)
from bovine plasma, thrombin from bovine plasma (40–60% protein,
40–300 NIH units/mg protein), elastin from bovine neck ligament,
collagen type I solution from bovine skin, Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) (Mw = 125 000 kDa), calcium sulfate dihydrate salt
(CaSO4. 2H2O), and glutaraldehyde solution (25%)
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Germany. E. coli (ATCC 8739) and S. aureus (ATCC 6538)
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.

4.2 Preparation of Cs/PVA Nanofibrous Scaffolds
Two different
concentrations of Cs were prepared (2% and 3% wt)
in 1% glacial acetic acid. PVA was prepared at concentrations of 9
and 10% wt in highly purified hot distilled water (D.W; 80 °C).
Cs-PVA blends were prepared in two different weight ratios (1:9 and
2:8). To obtain a well-blended polymeric mixture, the Cs-PVA solutions
were left to mix for 4 h on a continued stirrer.

The resulting
beadless nanofiber mesh was chosen to be used within the asymmetric
scaffold structure and for further characterization tests. The electrospinning
process was started by inducing the prepared blends into a 10 mL plastic
syringe placed in a syringe pump and connected to a silicone tube,
which allows solutions to flow with a flow rate of 0.8 mL/h through
the stainless steel needle of the syringe. The electrical voltage
was fixed to 18 kV applied to the needle tip, and the tip-to-collector
distance was settled at 12 cm. The produced nanofiber meshes were
collected on a flat stationary copper plate collector covered with
an aluminum foil. The resultant nanofibers were cross-linked in a
sealed desiccator using 25% of aqueous glutaraldehyde solution and
left for 12 h and then dried in a vacuum oven for 2 h at a temperature
of 60 °C to dispose of glutaraldehyde residual remnants.28

4.3 Xerogel Synthesis
Elastin (El.) powder
with a concentration of 11% was dissolved in DMSO and added to collagen
(Colg., 0.3%) and alginate (Alg., 3%) (to develop X1 xerogel) or to
gelatin (6%) and alginate (3%) (to develop X2 xerogel). The (Alg.
Gel. El., X1) solution was fixed to the weight ratio of 3:7:1.5, while
the (Alg. Colg. El., X2) solution was fixed to the ratio of 7:1.5:1.5.
Alginate polymeric solution was prepared at a concentration of 3%
to develop single alginate xerogel mats. The X1 and X2 xerogel scaffolds
were synthesized using the internal gelation method and freeze-drying
technique. All polymeric solutions were mixed overnight to ensure
perfect homogenization at 37 °C. The obtained mixtures were further
poured in 83 mm glass Petri dishes and then cross-linked in 3% CaSO4.2H2O at room temperature to allow gelation for
1 h, followed by lyophilization for 12 h to produce the dry form of
a hydrogel, which is the xerogel. The fabricated samples were kept
at room temperature for further use.

4.4 Scaffold
Characterization
Xerogel
scaffolds were examined for their porosity, pore surface area distribution,
and pore diameter dispersion using a mercury intrusion porosimeter
under elevated pressure from 100 kPa to 207 MPa. Washburn mathematical eq 1 was used to determine
the mean pore size for each sample 1  where (P) is referring to
the applied pressure, (D) to the pore diameter, (γ)
to the mercury surface tension (484 mN/m), and (θ) is the mercury
pore wall contact angle measured as 141.31 °C.

Fabricated
NF and xerogel scaffolds were tested for their swelling and degradation
behavior in a stimulated PBS medium (37 °C) at certain time intervals
(2, 6, 12, and 24 h). The scaffold weight was measured before and
after immersion in PBS swelling medium to calculate the swelling ratio
as per eq 2. The process
was performed in triplicates for each investigated sample and continued
until reaching a steady weight, and the measurements were demonstrated
as ± mean standard deviation. 2  where Mb represents
the weight of the samples before immersion in the swelling buffer
and Ma indicates the weight of the samples
after immersion for specific time intervals (t).

The scaffold degradation rate (mass loss %) was evaluated by drying
the samples at room temperature under vacuum until reaching a fixed
weight and re-weighting at 2, 4, and 8 days, according to eq 3 3  where Mb represents
the weight of the samples before immersion in PBS buffer and Md refers to the weight of the samples after
complete dehydration (%).

4.5 Evaluation of in Vitro
Antibacterial Activity
Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) were used to assess the antibacterial
capacity of the created nanofiber
scaffolds. The nanofiber mats (Cs 2%–PVA10%, Cs 3%–PVA10%,
and PVA10%) were investigated at fixed concentrations (10 mg and 15
mg/mL) of each sample using the broth dilution method. The bacterial
inoculum was prepared by preculturing the Gram-negative and -positive
bacteria in Difco nutrient broth (NB) at a temperature of 37 °C,
which then was left overnight on a rotating shaker at 225 rpm. The
optical density (OD600) of the bacterial overnight culture was standardized
spectrophotometrically to be 0.1 × 108 CFU/mL. Afterward, the
test tubes including the examined nanofiber samples were incubated
overnight (14–18 h) at 37 °C on a rotating shaker at 225
rpm. Following that, a stepwise dilution was done for each overnight
cultured sample until reaching a dilution of 10–5 for E. coli and 10–7 for S. aureus using nutrient broth
media. Then, the diluted samples were plated on Difco nutrient agar
plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

CFU per mL of
the overnight culture was calculated according to eq 4(75) as
follows 4  where N = CFU/mL, C = the number
of colonies per plate, and D = the number of the
1:10 dilution.

The MIC of the tested samples were first identified
manually by
visual observation at a dilution factor of 10–5 for E. coli and 10–7 for S. aureus when diluted in sterile Eppendorf tubes.
This observation was then confirmed by stepwise dilution of each sample
using NB media in a sterile 96-well microtiter plate. Then, the MIC
was read using the microplate reader 65 (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG LABTECH,
Germany) after overnight incubation of the culture at 37 °C.75

Moreover, the MBC of the tested NF samples
was evaluated visibly
by subculturing the broths used for MIC determination onto fresh agar
plates and incubating overnight at 37 °C. The MBC was determined
by visual observation of the lowest broth dilution that was successful
in restraining the growth of each examined E. coli and S. aureus bacterial strains separately
on the agar plates.76

The test was
done in triplicates for each tested sample, and the
conventional plate count was used to identify the number of viable
bacterial colonies.

4.6 Cell Culture Assay
Wild-type (wt)
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured as a monolayer in
DMEM media complemented with 4500 mg/L glucose, l-glutamine,
sodium pyruvate, sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. wt MEF cells were passaged three
times every week in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks and incubated
in a 5% CO2 incubator (Heracell incubator, Thermo Scientific)
at 37 °C. Trypsin (0.25%) containing 0.1% ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid was used in cell detachment before passaging or before the specified
assays. Trypan blue was used in cell counting using a hemocytometer.

All examined scaffold specimen mats were sterilized for 1 h (for
each side) using UV radiation. Thereafter, all samples were neutralized
using PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 min to remove any acidic or glutaraldehyde
traces. Following that, submerging in DMEM with different weight concentrations
(10 mg and 15 mg/mL for nanofiber mats and 25 mg/mL for hydrogel mats)
and incubation overnight at 37 °C were done to produce condition
media with various examined concentrations. Seeded wt MEF cells with
conventional DMEM media were used as a negative control, while cultured
wt MEF cells with PVA nanofibrous or alginate xerogel mat condition
media were used as a positive control for nanofiber mats and xerogels,
respectively.

The samples were investigated in triplicates,
and the average of
results was plotted as mean ± standard error.

4.6.1 Indirect
Cytotoxicity Assay
Fabricated
scaffolds were tested for their cytotoxicity against wt MEF cell lines
according to the ISO10993-5 standard-based procedure. wt MEF cells
were cultured in a 96-well plate at a density of 3000 cells/well to
reach semiconfluency after 24 h, and then the medium was exchanged
with the different concentrations of the incubated condition media
and reincubated once for 24 h and once for 48 h. After treatment,
the condition solutions were replaced by 100 μL of 1 mg/mL MTT
reagent for each well and left for 4 h. Following that, the cells
were washed with PBS twice after removing the MTT medium and 100 μL/well
of a 100% DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals formed
in living cells. Cell viability was identified using the microplate
reader 65 (SPECTROstar Nano, BMG LABTECH, Germany) at an absorbance
(ABS) of 570 nm. The viability of negative control samples was recognized
as 100% and calculated according to eq 5 as follows 5  

4.6.2 In
Vitro Two-Dimensional Wound Healing Assay
(Mechanical Wounding)
The scratch assay was used to evaluate
the capacity of the fabricated nanofibrous and xerogel scaffolds in
enhancing cell migration. wt MEF cells were seeded at 5000 cells/well
in a 96-well plate to reach confluency after 24 h. A straight line
was produced in the middle of each sample well to create a scratch
using the p10 pipette tip. The wound was induced before replacing
the DMEM conventional media with the prepared condition ones and washed
with PBS two times to remove any cell debris and soften the wound
edges and then 100 μL/well of each sample condition medium was
added. The closure of the different created wounds was examined periodically
at specific time intervals (0, 24, and 48 h) using the Olympus IX70
fluorescence microscope. Image J analysis software was used to assess
the wound closure behavior of each induced scratch beginning from t = 0 to the last interval point, and the wound recovery
(%) was calculated according to eq 6 6  where XT0 refers
to induced wound area at t = 0 and XTx is the wound area at a specific time interval point.
