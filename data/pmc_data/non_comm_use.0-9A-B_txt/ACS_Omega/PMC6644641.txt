To
obtain a new type of biodegradable material with high toughness
and strength used for fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing, a
series of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS)-based polymer materials was
prepared via blending with polylactide (PLA). The rheological, thermal,
and mechanical properties as well as FDM printing performances of
the blends, such as distortion, cross section, and the interlayer
bond strength, were characterized. The results show that with increasing
PLA content, the blends possess higher melt viscosity, larger tensile
strength, and modulus, which are more suitable for FDM printing. Especially,
when the content of PLA is more than 40%, distortion due to residual
stress caused by volume shrinkage disappears during the printing process
and thus products with good dimensional accuracy and pearl-like gloss
are obtained. The results demonstrate that the blend compositions
with moderate viscosity, low degree of crystallinity, and high modulus
are more suitable for FDM printing. Compared with the low elongation
upon breaking of commercially FDM-printed material, the PBS/PLA blend
materials exhibit a typical ductile behavior with elongation of 90–300%.
Therefore, besides biodegradability, the PBS/PLA blends present excellent
mechanical properties and suitability as materials for FDM printing.
In addition, our study is expected to provide methods for valuating
the suitability of whether a thermoplastic polymer material is suitable
for FDM printing or not.

Introduction
Three-dimensional (3D) printing, also
known as additive manufacturing,
is a rapid prototyping technology that directly produces three-dimensional
entities under the control of computer-aided design software.1,2 Compared with the traditional processing methods such as injection
molding, 3D printing demonstrates some unique advantages, such as
individual customization, lack of need of molds, and much shorter
time from design to production.1,2 Therefore, it has been
widely applied in automotive, construction, clothing, health care,
and other industries, especially where there are requirements for
individual customization.3,4 Among the various types
of 3D printing, fused deposition modeling (FDM) has been recognized
as the cheapest and the most widely adopted prototyping technology,
where a thermoplastic filament is heated to melt, then extruded from
the nozzle and deposited layer by layer on a support platform.3,4 According to the above-mentioned principles, there are several requirements
for a matrix material that could be used in FDM. First, its melt should
have proper viscosity and strength so that it can be consistently
extruded out of the nozzle without breakage or buckling. Once the
melt-breaking happens, not only will the time-consuming processes
be interrupted but also the already started printing process cannot
be continued, which will cause trouble in commercial applications.
Second, when the surface of one layer touches another, the consolidation
and thermal shrinkage happen simultaneously, which may lead to unfavorable
distortion.4 Considering the filaments
would shrink after extruding from the nozzle, the volume shrinkage
rate of materials would determine the dimensional accuracy of printing.
It has been shown that the crystallization of material is the main
factor that affects molding shrinkage.4 Finally, mechanical properties of the finished parts largely depend
on the interfacial adhesion between two neighboring layers.5,6

In the past few decades, researchers have been devoted to
develop
new polymer materials to obtain FDM products with both good mechanical
properties and high dimensional accuracy. Polylactide (PLA), a bio-based
and biodegradable aliphatic polyester, has attracted much attention
and been widely used in the FDM printing.7−11 With monomers obtained from the fermentation of starch,
PLA can be completely degraded into carbondioxide and water under
natural conditions. Moreover, during printing, compared with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
(ABS) copolymers and polyamides, the PLA filaments can be melted at
lower temperature with little awful smell and the support platform
can be set at room temperature.5 However,
although having a relatively high tensile strength, PLA is a typical
brittle material with extremely low elongation at break (≤3%),
which has limited its applications.12,13 Considering
most 3D printing filaments are brittle,14 it is necessary to develop new ductile materials for different application
requirements.

Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), a semicrystalline
aliphatic polyester,
has demonstrated excellent processability, thermal stability, and
biodegradability.15 Due to its excellent
ductility and relatively low melting point (less than 120 °C),
it is considered to be a candidate for use as FDM filament. However,
there are few published studies on 3D printing with PBS. One reason
is that its low melt strength makes it difficult to continually form
monofilament when extruded, which makes printing fail halfway. Moreover,
the distortion caused by the relatively large volume shrinkage during
cooling probably happens after crystallization, thus resulting in
defective products. Therefore, modification of PBS is quite necessary
to solve the drawbacks mentioned above and make the material suitable
for FDM printing.

Blending can combine the advantages of the
two components, which
is thus one of the most commonly used modification methods for polymer
materials.16 PBS has been blended with
starches, wood flours, and other biodegradable polymers.17−21 Chieng at al. blended PBS with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) and organomodified montmorillonite to improve the
strength and modulus.17 Similarly, Okamoto
et al. reported that PBS/layered-silicate nanocomposites had significantly
improved the modulus but with decreased tensile strength.18 In addition, Qiu et al. prepared PLA/PBS blends
with the aim of improving the ductility of PLA and the results showed
that the crystallinity of PLA/PBS blends increased with the addition
of PBS content. The ductility of PLA can be improved but with a compromise
of stiffness and strength.19 Notably, Zhang
et al. found that the tensile properties of PLA/PBS blends were higher
than the anticipated values and a synergistic effect was proposed
to explain this phenomena.20 Although there
have been a few reports on PBS blends, there is still little research
done on the application of PBS blends in FDM 3D printing.

The
main goal of this research is to prepare PBS/PLA blends with
different compositions and validate their suitability as filaments
for FDM printing. The rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties
of the blends were investigated, and different specimens were printed
with these filaments to evaluate their suitability for FDM system.
Interlayer bond strength in the printed products was also measured.
Furthermore, we expect to find a relationship between the properties
of materials and the performance of FDM printing so as to give a reference
for judging whether a thermoplastic polymer material, not limited
to polymer blends, is suitable for FDM printing or not.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of PBS/PLA Blends
Rheological Properties of Different Blends
Since viscosity
is an important parameter for both filament extrusion and FDM printing,
we first measured the shear viscosity of the polymer blend melt in
a rotary rheometer, with the results shown in Figure 1. In general, the complex viscosity of the
PBS/PLA blends increases with the addition of PLA, since PLA melt
has a much higher zero-shear viscosity than that of PBS at the measured
temperature. In the low-frequency range, both the virgin PBS and its
blends exhibit a Newtonian plateau, whereas they demonstrate shear
thinning in the high-frequency range. Moreover, with the increasing
content of PLA, the shear thinning behavior becomes more significant,
representing a typical characteristic of the pseudoplastic fluid behavior.21 On one hand, the proper increase of complex
viscosity is expected to be favorable for the FDM printing process
based on extrusion. As reported in the literature, the modulus/viscosity
ratio of FDM-printed filaments before heating zones should be in a
range of (3–5) × 105 s–1 to
ensure the continuous convey of polymer filament without buckling.22 On the other hand, a very high viscosity of
the polymer melt would result in swelling of the extruded rod and
poor adhesion of the neighboring layers, which can directly cause
the failure of printing.23 Therefore, the
shear viscosity of the melt should be in a proper range. The dynamic
shear storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus
(G″) of the polymer blends with changed frequencies
were measured, as presented in Figure 1b,c. Obviously, it can be seen that all polymer blends
exhibit a typical viscoelastic behavior (G″
> G′) in the whole frequency range. The
storage
modulus of PBS/PLA blends is higher than that of the virgin PBS, which
mainly attributes to the incorporation of PLA hindering the motion
of molecules. Power law model of the viscosity is described by eq 1 1  where K is a constant prefactor, n is the power law exponent, and γ̇ is the shear
rate. The parameters calculated by the power law model are summarized
in Table 1. With addition
of PLA, the n value of the blends drops compared
with the virgin PBS, indicating a stronger trend of shear thinning.
Meanwhile, the melt viscosity has been improved, which is consistent
with the analysis of complex viscosity mentioned above.

complex viscosity (η*) (a), storage modulus

shear rate. The number after PBS indicates the weight percentage of
PBS in PBS/PLA blends.

We have estimated the shear rates in filament extrusion
and FDM
printing according to eq 2 2  where v̅ and D represent the average extrusion rate of the melt and the
inner diameter of the rod die, respectively. For filament extrusion,
the extrusion rate was around 1.8 m min–1, namely,
0.03 m s–1. The inner diameter of the extrusion
die was 0.003 m. The estimated shear rate for filament extrusion was
approximately 40 s–1. For FDM printing, the material
was extruded at a rate of 0.04 m s–1 through a nozzle
with inner diameter of 0.0004 m so the shear rate was around 400 s–1. The shear rate during preparation of the filaments
is in the range of oscillatory rheology measurements and that in the
later FDM printing using the filaments is out of the range and can
be measured by a capillary rheometer.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) Analysis of the Polymer
Blend Filaments
Thermal properties such as the glass transition
temperatures of the blends were measured via DSC. The thermograms
during the first heating scan are plotted in Figure 2. The PLA used in this work is an amorphous
polymer with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 54 °C. The used PBS is a semicrystalline polymer
with Tg around −35 °C and
melting point about 114 °C. The melt temperature (Tm) of PBS in the blends is lower, but the crystallization
temperature (Tc) during cooling is slightly
higher than that of pure PBS, which indicates that PLA or the interface
of the two components may show a nucleation effect on the crystallization
of PBS. Moreover, all blends demonstrate only one endothermal melting
peak, which belongs to PBS crystalline phase. The degree of crystallinity
of the PBS phase (XC,PBS) is determined
by eq 3 3  where ΔHm is the enthalpy of melting and ΔHc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization. ΔH100 is the enthalpy of fusion for a 100% crystalline polymer,
which is 110.3 J g–1 for PBS.16 The thermal properties of PBS/PLA blends and their FDM-printed
parts are summarized in Table 2. Since PLA used here is nearly amorphous, the apparent crystallinity
in the blends decreases with the addition of PLA. Recrystallization
of PBS crystals during heating is clearly observed in the blends with
PBS content larger than 60%, which agrees with our previous DSC results.24 To present the difference of crystallinity in
the polymer blends, the Y-axis of all thermograms
in Figure 2a is in
the same scale of W g–1 and the curves are vertically
offset to separate and show them clearly. Figure 2b shows the enlarged view of the thermograms
at around the glass transition temperature of PLA. The endothermal
peak accompanying the glass transition in PBS40/PLA60 and PBS20/PLA80
blends probably results from enthalpic relaxation of the aged PLA
component in the blends after storage.

Mechanical Properties of
the Injection-Molded Bars of the Blends
The pellets of polymer
blends were injection-molded in a microinjection
machine to prepare dumbbell-shaped and cuboid bars for tensile and
impact tests, respectively. The mechanical properties of these bars
are presented in Table 3. The tensile modulus of the materials increases with introduction
of PLA. Significantly, the tensile modulus has been improved by 2.88
times when the PLA content reaches 80%. With the increasing content
of PLA from 0 to 80 wt %, the tensile strength of PBS increases from
41.5 to 55.6 MPa and the elongation at break decreases. It is of particular
interest that the PBS80/PLA20 blend exhibits the maximum elongation
at break. This phenomenon can be attributed to the effect of rigid
filler toughening.20,25 When a small amount of brittle
polymer (e.g. PLA) is dispersed in a ductile polymer matrix (PBS),
the dispersed phase acting as a point of stress concentration can
absorb energy by mechanical deformation. Other possible mechanisms
of toughening may result from more microvoids and larger shear yielding
in the matrix in presence of the dispersed phase.25 The tensile properties of the commercially available filaments
produced by the company Stratasys are listed in Table 4 for comparison.15 Obviously, the elongation at break of PBS/PLA blends prepared in
this work is much higher than that of commercially available filaments
listed in Table 4.
At the same time, the polymer blends exhibit acceptable tensile strength
and modulus, with tensile strength higher than that of most of the
commercially adopted materials listed in Table 4. More specifically, the impact strength
of PBS/PLA blends is significantly improved when the weight percent
of PLA reaches 20%, which means that the blend PBS80/PLA20 is toughened
and strengthened simultaneously due to the above-mentioned synergistic
effect. Notably, the Izod impact strength values of the studied blends
are all higher than that of the pure PBS. Compared with pure PLA,
the studied polymer blends, especially PBS20/PLA80, PBS40/PLA60, and
PBS60/PLA40, possess high impact strength and elongation at break
as well as not much decreased tensile strength and modulus so they
are good candidate materials for FDM printing.

FDM Printing Using PBS/PLA Blend Filaments
Appearance and Fracture
Surfaces of the FDM-Printed Bars
After extrusion of the blend
pellets into filaments, the samples
printed by FDM are presented in Figure 3. The cuboid model is used to show the distortion,
which is a major obstacle for FDM printing. For PBS/PLA blends, the
printed samples exhibit a pretty white luster and no observable distortion
when the PBS content is not more than 60%. However, when the weight
ratio of PBS is more than 80%, serious distortion can be observed.
The distortion may be attributed to the thermal stress caused by volume
shrinkage during cooling. The blends with more PBS have a higher degree
of apparent crystallinity (Table 2) and lower modulus (Table 3), thus leading to higher distortion. Printing
with pure PBS fails due to the serious warping and distortion, proving
that the modification of PBS is necessary for its application in FDM
printing.

After being quenched in liquid
nitrogen, the FDM-printed PBS/PLA
bars were fractured and the cross sections were observed in scanning
electron microscope (SEM) after being sputtered with gold, as shown
in Figure 4. The layer
structure is quite obvious when the PBS content is less than 60%.
Due to lower melt viscosity (Figure 1a), the PBS80/PLA20 and pure PBS bars exhibit better
interlayer bonding, as demonstrated in Figure 4d,e.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) Analysis of FDM-Printed
Parts
During FDM printing, the previously printed layer is
reheated by the new printing layer on top, which leads to recrystallization
in the former. Thus, the different parts of printed articles probably
possess different degrees of crystallinity. Moreover, the printing
parameters, such as the temperature of the printing nozzle and the
support platform, were reported to have a considerable effect on the
crystallinity of printed specimens.7,9 To investigate
the effect of FDM printing process on the crystallization behavior
of the PBS/PLA blends, thermal analysis of the printed bars was performed
on a DSC. Samples used for DSC analysis were all obtained from their
bottom almost at the same position, since the crystallization behavior
might not be the same at the different heights of FDM-printed parts.7 The thermograms of the specimens from the printed
bars during the first heating run could indicate the initial crystallization
information during processing, which are compared with the thermograms
of the raw filaments, as summarized in Table 5. The degree of crystallinity in the FDM-printed
parts of PBS100, PBS80/PLA20, and PBS60/PLA40 is higher than that
in the raw filaments. Considering that all printing was conducted
with a support platform at room temperature and its effect on crystallization
was negligible, this phenomenon might be attributed to the fact that
cooling of the printed bars was slow and recrystallization probably
happened when the new printing layer on top reheated the bottom layer
in contact.

Optimal Composition and Nozzle Temperature
for PBS/PLA Blends
Used in FMD Printing
From the above results, PBS40/PLA60
blend with moderate melt viscosity, a high modulus, and a low degree
of crystallinity (thus low volume shrinkage) is more suitable as filaments
for FDM printing in terms of the final product performance of good
interlayer bonding and low distortion. Since the interlayer bonding
during FDM printing occurs almost quiescently, the zero-shear viscosity
of melt is an important factor. To find a suitable printing temperature
range for the blend, the zero-shear viscosity of PBS40/PLA60 under
different temperatures was tested and the results are shown in Figure 5. The zero-shear
viscosity increases sharply when the melt temperature drops from 190
to 160 °C. Referring to the size accuracy and smoothness of the
printed parts, the optimal nozzle temperature for PBS40/PLA60 should
be set above 190 °C, for example, at a temperature range of 200–230
°C.

Figure 5 Variation of the zero-shear viscosity of PBS40/PLA60 melt with
temperature.

Interlayer Bond Strength
of the FDM-Printed Specimens
In a typical FDM system, specimens
are usually prepared track by
track and layer by layer. Such a printing process generates a large
amount of voids and gaps inevitably, resulting in worse mechanical
performances when compared with those made by the traditional processing
method.26 To characterize the bond strength
in the vertical direction between two neighboring layers of FDM-printed
parts, we printed the specimens according to the type V in ASTM D638
standard and two rectangular thin sections on the bottom of each specimen
were designed to assure firm attachment on the platform, as shown
in Figure 6. The specimens
were printed with different blend filaments without a preheated support
platform or any adhesive. Then, the tensile strength of these specimens
was measured. We chose PBS40/PLA60 with both good mechanical properties
and printing performance, as a reference material to evaluate the
effect of printing temperature on the interlayer bond strength. The
results are summarized in Table 6. With the increasing content of PLA, the tensile strength
of the printed parts decreases, which can be attributed to weaker
interlayer bonding due to higher zero-shear viscosity of the melt
(as shown in Figure 1a). For the fixed blend composition, when the nozzle temperature
becomes higher, the interlayer bond strength decreases in the studied
temperature range, which is out of expectation. Usually, the materials
extruded at higher temperature should show lower melt viscosity and
thus better interlayer adhesion so as to improve the bond strength.
However, this expectation contradicts the experimental results here.
We propose that the decreased bond strength at higher printing temperature
may arise from thermal degradation of PLA when the nozzle temperature
is higher than 190 °C. The considerable thermal degradation of
PLA 2002D after thermal processing at 170–200 °C was previously
reported.27

Models of PBS/PLA Blends Printed by FDM
Two 3D-printed
models, a rabbit printed with PBS60/PLA40 and a tower printed with
PBS40/PLA60, are shown in Figure 7a,b. The smooth printing process and the nice appearance
of the models indicate that the two blends are suitable as FDM filaments.
For each blend, the optimal processing conditions are defined, such
as the temperature of nozzle, infill degree, and layer thickness.
The prepared PBS/PLA blends can be used to print not only thick-walled
but also thin-walled hollow structures without observable distortion
and defects. Furthermore, the platform to support the printed models
can be set at room temperature during the whole printing process and
no other support structure or adhesive is necessary, endowing these
blend materials with ease of FDM printing and better mechanical properties.

Conclusions
In this work, PBS/PLA blends used for FDM printing were prepared.
All blends exhibit excellent processing properties and can be extruded
as monofilaments with 1.75 mm diameter via a single-screw extruder.
With increasing PBS content, the elongation at break and impact strength
of the blends arise. However, distortion of the printed bars increases
due to larger volume shrinkage resulting from the higher degree of
crystallinity in the blends. In addition, the interlayer bond strength
improves due to the decreased melt viscosity. When PLA content in
the blends is not less than 40 wt %, FDM printing can proceed smoothly
with neither observable distortion nor detachment from the platform
at room temperature. PBS60/PLA40 and PBS40/PLA60 are the optimal blend
compositions, considering both material toughness, distortion of printed
bars, and interlayer bond strength. Models with porous structure can
be successfully printed using PBS60/PLA40 and PBS40/PLA60 filaments,
and good dimensional accuracy and gloss appearance of the printed
models have been obtained. Compared with the commercial printing materials,
the blends are proved to possess both high stiffness and excellent
ductility. Moreover, with a relatively low printing temperature and
no need for heating of the support platform, these materials appeal
for meeting energy-saving and environmentally friendly requirements.
Therefore, with pearl-like gloss and good mechanical properties as
well as dimensional accuracy, the bio-based PBS/PLA blends are new
promising materials for producing FDM filaments for applications in
many fields, especially for architectural design. Furthermore, our
study is expected to provide methods for evaluating whether a thermoplastic
polymer material is suitable for FDM printing or not.

Experimental
Section
Materials
The PLA (2002D, with melt flow rate (MFR)
of 6 g/10 min under a 2.16 Kg load at 210 °C) was purchased from
Nature Works Co. Ltd. Its number-average molecular weight (Mn) and the polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) were reported to be
120 000 and 1.75, respectively.27 PBS (TH803S, with MFR of 8 g/10 min under a 2.16 Kg load at 190
°C) was provided by Xinjiang Blue Ridge Tunhe Polyester Co. Ltd.
(China). Mn and Mw/Mn of PBS were measured to be
83 000 and 2.68, respectively.

Sample Preparation
PBS and PLA pellets were dried at
65 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven before processing to ensure the
removal of any absorbed moisture. Subsequently, PBS and PLA with different
feeding ratios were added into a twin-screw extruder (Nanjing Hass
Extrusion Equipment Co., Ltd. China). Temperatures at the four heating
zones (from hopper to extruder die) were set at 150, 170, 180, and
185 °C, respectively. Then, the extrudate cooled in a water bath
was pelletized using a granulator. Dried again in vacuum, the pellets
of the blends were homogenized through mixing and finally re-extruded
into 1.75 ± 0.02 mm monofilaments via a single-screw extruder
(Haake Polylab OS, Thermo Fisher). Temperatures of the heating zone
1–3 in the single-screw extruder were 130, 150, and 160 °C,
respectively. The die temperature was 150 °C, and the speed of
the screw was 10.0–30.0 rpm, which varied with the blending
ratio. After being dried again in vacuum, a portion of the monofilament
was pelletized again and molded into different specimens with a specified
size for various measurements.

Monofilaments of different blends
were used to print different specimens and models with an FDM printer
(AOD Dreamer, Qingdao Autolay 3D printing Co., Ltd. China). A typical
FDM printing process is as follows: First, digital models were predesigned
in a computer with the software and then exported as standard triangle
language (STL) file types. Second, the STL files were modified with
the printer software and exported as g-code files. The g-code files
were exported into the FDM printer. Third, a 1.75 mm monofilament
was fed into the FDM printer via two pinch rollers. The nozzle diameter
of the FDM printer was 0.40 mm, and the nozzle temperature was set
at 190 °C if not specified. The printer platform was placed at
room temperature without heating or using any adhesives. The printing
head speed was maintained at 1.5 m min–1 for all
layers. The layer height was set as 0.1 mm. Then, the specimens were
printed layer by layer. The first layer was printed with a deposition
orientation of 45°, and the second layer was printed with an
orientation of 135°. The other layers were printed with the two
orientations alternatively. To obtain the optimal mechanical properties,
the infill ratio was set as 100%.

Characterization
The thermal transition temperatures
of the materials were examined via differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) on a DSC-60 apparatus from Shimadzu, Japan. For each blend,
a 2.0–3.5 mg sample was sealed in an aluminum pan and the blank
pan was used as the reference. The thermograms during the first heating
run were obtained during heating from room temperature to 160 °C
at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under nitrogen
flow of 45 mL min–1. The DSC curves during the following
cooling run from 160 to 50 °C at a cooling rate of 10 °C
min–1 were recorded as well. Rheology of the samples
was measured on a rotary rheometer (MCR301, Anton Paar, Austria).
The samples were tested in the oscillation mode with small amplitude,
using a parallel-plate geometry with a diameter of 25 mm. The gap
between plates was set at 2.0 mm. The strain was set at 1.0% and the
testing temperature was 160 °C, if not specified. The frequency
sweep range was from 628.3 to 0.06283 rad s–1. Testing
samples for rheology were compression-molded at 210 °C under
a pressure of 8 MPa. Tensile tests were performed with dumbbell-shaped
samples with dimensions of 10.0 mm (length) × 4.0 mm (neck width)
× 2.0 mm (thickness) by using an UTM-1432 tensile testing machine
from Chengde Jinjian Testing Instrument Co., Ltd. at a crosshead speed
of 50 mm min–1. The Izod impact strength of the
notched specimens was measured on an XJUD-5.5 impact tester (Chengde
Jinjian Testing Instrument Co., Ltd.), according to the Chinese Standards
GB/T 1043. The sample size for the impact tests was 80 mm × 10
mm × 4.0 mm (L × W × H). Blend samples for mechanical
tests were prepared by injection molding using a microinjection molding
machine (Wuhan Qien Sci. Tech. Ltd., China). The barrel and mold temperature
were set at 210 °C and room temperature, respectively. The injection
pressure was 800 bar, and the dwell time was set as 15 s. At least
five samples were tested to obtain the average value of mechanical
properties and the standard error for each blend composition or printing
temperature. The cross section of the printed bars was examined by
a JSM-7401F scanning electron microscope (SEM, SBH-EasyProbe) at an
accelerating voltage of 10 kV. All of the samples were fractured after
being quenched in liquid nitrogen. The fractured surfaces were then
gold-sprayed before the SEM observation. Samples used to test interlayer
bond strengths were designed as shown in Figure 6 according to the type V specimen in the
ASTM D638 standard. Tensile testing of the specimens was conducted
at a crosshead speed of 10 mm min–1. The distance
between clamps was set at 25.0 mm and that between the gauges was
13.0 mm.
