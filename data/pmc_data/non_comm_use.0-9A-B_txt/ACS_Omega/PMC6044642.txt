This
study presents a novel spinel-type zinc aluminate nanometer
catalyst and is applied in catalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment.
The zinc aluminate (ZnAl2O4) catalysts were
synthesized by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and coprecipitation methods,
and their characteristics were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission
electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum, Fourier transform
infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. 5-Sulfosalicylic
acid (SSal) was selected as the typical pharmaceutical and personal
care product and used to evaluate the catalytic activity of ZnAl2O4. Compared to ozonation, an obviously higher
removal efficiency for the SSal degradation was achieved with the
nanocatalyst addition in catalytic ozonation. The removal of SSal
and chemical oxygen demand reached 64.8 and 46.2%, respectively, after
60 min in the presence of ZnAl2O4, whereas it
was only 49.4 and 33.2%, respectively, in ozonation. The comparison
of catalysts showed that the ZnAl2O4 prepared
by the hydrothermal method presented a better catalytic activity in
ozonation. The effect of radical scavenger experiment results and
the characterization of XPS implied that •OH was
the main active oxidative species in catalytic ozonation. The reusability
results showed that the ZnAl2O4 catalyst possessed
a high stability and could be widely used in catalytic ozonation for
wastewater treatment.

1 Introduction
The pharmaceutical and
personal care products (PPCPs) are widespread
in aquatic environments, and the pollution of PPCPs has received much
attention by the environmental workers. 5-Sulfosalicylic acid (SSal)
is a typical PPCP and widely used as the medical intermediate and
fine chemical material.1 Because of the
poor chemical oxidability and biodegradability, the industrial wastewater
containing SSal is difficult to be treated by the conventional biological
system. Thus, the effective removal of SSal from wastewater has a
significant impact on the environment.

In recent decades, advanced
oxidation processes (AOPs) such as
ozonation, electrooxidation, photooxidation, and Fenton have been
intensively investigated.2−6 AOPs could deal with organic pollutants in water through the formation
of •OH (redox potential = 2.8 V ev, SHE), which
could react rapidly and nonselectively with nearly all types of organic
compounds.7−9 As one of the AOPs, ozonation has been widely applied
in wastewater treatment for its strong oxidizing, simple operation,
and environmental friendly properties.10 In general, organics degradation by ozonation includes two pathways:
direct molecular ozone oxidation and indirect reaction via the decomposition
of ozone to generate the hydroxyl radicals (•OH)
to attack target pollutants. The direct oxidation with ozone is relatively
slow and selective, so it could not remove the pollutants completely,
especially some refractory organic compounds.11 Also, direct ozonation may require higher energy and cost in water
treatment.12,13 Therefore, catalytic ozonation
through indirect oxidation reaction has received considerable research
attention.

As compared to homogeneous catalytic ozonation, heterogeneous
catalytic
ozonation could recycle the catalyst from the reaction solution without
producing secondary pollution with solid catalysts, such as metal
oxides (e.g., Al2O3, MnO2, CeO2, and TiO2) or supported metal oxides (e.g., Ni/CeO2, Co/Al2O3, and TiO2/Al2O3).12,14,15 Compared with other conventional catalysts, ZnAl2O4 is considered to be a promising ozonation catalyst with the
advantages of being nontoxic and inexpensive and possessing good diffusion,
high thermal stability, excellent activity, and relatively wide surface
area.16−19 These characteristics make it very suitable for the application.

In this work, the ZnAl2O4 catalyst was prepared
by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and coprecipitation methods and used
in catalytic ozonation of wastewater. SSal was selected as the model
pollutant to explore the catalytic performance of three different
catalysts. The crystal structure, texture, morphology, size, and chemical
form of the surface element and the atomic ratio of catalysts were
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX), Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition,
the stability and reusability of the ZnAl2O4 catalyst was also discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of ZnAl2O4
The
crystallization phases of prepared catalysts
were identified by XRD, which are presented in Figure 1. ZnAl2O4–C,
ZnAl2O4–S, and ZnAl2O4–H exhibited the characteristic XRD peaks corresponding
to (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (4 0 0), (3 3 1), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), (4 4 0),
(6 2 0), and (5 3 3) planes reflection of ZnAl2O4 with a spinel cubic structure (JCPDS no. 05-0669). No impurity phases
were observed. After comparison of the three catalysts, the diffraction
peaks of ZnAl2O4–S were more intensive
and sharper, which demonstrated higher crystallization. On the other
hand, the wider peaks of ZnAl2O4–C indicated
its smaller particle size. On the basis of Scherrer’s formula,20 the average crystallite sizes of ZnAl2O4–C, ZnAl2O4–H, and
ZnAl2O4–S were calculated to be ca. 12,
14, and 25.3 nm, respectively, by full width at half-maximum intensity
of the (3 1 1) plane of the ZnAl2O4 phase.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of ZnAl2O4 samples.

TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis are effective
methods to identify the morphologies of the catalyst, whose results
are in good accordance with XRD results.21Figure 2a–d
showed the TEM micrographs of ZnAl2O4. It could
be seen that the particle size distribution of three catalysts was
very narrow, and the size was measured by a digital micrograph.22 The nanoparticle sizes of ZnAl2O4–C, ZnAl2O4–H, and ZnAl2O4–S varied from 11–14, 14–23,
and 18–28 nm, respectively. A high-resolution TEM micrograph
(inset in Figure 2d)
of ZnAl2O4–H showed a lattice fringe
of distance of about 0.247 nm corresponding to the (3 1 1) plane of
the cubic zinc aluminate structure from XRD. Furthermore, the SAED
pattern, presented in Figure 2e, exhibits the diffraction rings with d-spacings
about 0.284, 0.247, 0.203, 0.156, and 0.142 nm, which are assigned
to (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of the spinel phase,
respectively. The same conclusion was drawn from ZnAl2O4–C and ZnAl2O4–S. EDX
was used to analyze the element or chemical characterization of the
catalyst qualitatively.10Figure 2f gave the EDX pattern of ZnAl2O4 samples. Clearly, the prepared catalyst samples
were composed of Zn, Al, and O.

The pHpzc could be used to determine the catalytic
property.
In this work, we obtained the pHpzc by the pH drift method.
When pH < pHpzc, the hydroxyls groups at the surface
of the catalyst become protonated and has a positive charge. On the
contrary, when pH > pHpzc, the hydroxyl groups at the
surface
of the catalytic become deprotonated and have a negative charge. From Figure 3, the pHpzc values of 8.00, 7.13, and 7.00 for ZnAl2O4–H, ZnAl2O4–S, and ZnAl2O4–C were obtained, respectively. The surface hydroxyl
groups were analyzed, which could promote the generation of •OH from aqueous ozone.23 For ZnAl2O4–H, ZnAl2O4–S,
and ZnAl2O4–C, the densities of surface
hydroxyl groups were 3.2, 2.5, and 2.3 mmol/g, respectively.

Figure 3 pHpzc of ZnAl2O4 samples.

2.2 Catalytic Activity of ZnAl2O4
SSal was used to be the target pollutant to evaluate
the catalytic activity of ZnAl2O4 samples. The
removal of SSal and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was investigated
by ozonation degradation of SSal, and the results are presented in Figure 4. Figure 4a showed the efficiency of
SSal removal in ozonation and catalytic ozonation with ZnAl2O4–H. After 60 min, the removal rate of SSal reached
64.8% in catalytic ozonation with ZnAl2O4–H,
while it was only 49.4% in ozonation. Almost no pollutant was adsorbed
on the ZnAl2O4–H surface with the results
of adsorption experiments. Figure 4b showed the SSal removal in the presence of different
ZnAl2O4 samples. All the three prepared samples
demonstrated good catalytic activity for degradation SSal. The removal
rate of SSal was 59 and 61.7% in catalytic ozonation for ZnAl2O4–C and ZnAl2O4–S,
respectively.

Figure 4 SSal degradation efficiency with different processes (a)
and with
different catalyst samples (b), COD removal rate with different catalyst
samples and the insertion shows the fitting results (c). Experimental
conditions: initial SSal concentration: 500 mg/L, initial pH = 7.0,
ozone dose: 5.0 mg/min (a,b) and 10.0 mg/min (c), catalyst dose: 0.2
g/L.

Figure 4c shows
the results of COD removal using various ZnAl2O4 samples. It could be found that the COD was removed only by 33.2%
with ozonation after 60 min, while it reached 36.6, 38.8, and 46.2%
in the presence of ZnAl2O4–C, ZnAl2O4–S, and ZnAl2O4–H,
respectively. On the basis of kinetic analysis, it was found that
the results of COD removal were followed the pseudo-first order reaction.11 When ZnAl2O4–H
was added, the pseudo first-order rate constants increased from 6.3
× 10–3 to 10.4 × 10–3 min–1 compared with ozonation (inset in Figure 4c). The results demonstrated
that ZnAl2O4 displayed a good catalytic performance
compared to ozonation for the degradation of SSal. Moreover, the effect
of ZnAl2O4–H was better than ZnAl2O4–C and ZnAl2O4–S
for both the removal of SSal and COD. According to the characterization
results of ZnAl2O4 with the surface properties,
it was found that the catalytic activity of ZnAl2O4 was positively related to the density of surface hydroxyl
groups. Therefore, surface hydroxyl groups would be the critical factor
to investigate active oxidative species in catalytic ozonation.

2.3 Investigation of Active Oxidative Species
The active oxidative species played an important part in the catalytic
ozonation of SSal with ZnAl2O4, which enhanced
the SSal removal and mineralization of organics. On the basis of the
reaction mechanism of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation,10 a stronger hydroxyl radical scavenger of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, 50 mmol/L) was used to verify the
formation of •OH because of aqueous ozone decomposition
in the presence of ZnAl2O4 and participated
in the reaction with catalytic ozonation.24 TBA reacted with •OH rapidly and suppressed the
chain reaction.25Figure 5 shows that the removal rate of SSal was
decreased greatly in the ozonation/ZnAl2O4 when
TBA was added. The result indicated that more •OH
was formed in the presence of ZnAl2O4, and it
played a crucial role as the active oxidative species for degradation
of SSal.

Figure 5 Effect of radical scavenger TBA on catalytic ozonation of SSal.

Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectra of
the synthesis of ZnAl2O4 by the three methods.
FT-IR is an appropriate technique to investigate the chemical adsorption
or interaction.26 The band could be seen
at around 3451 cm–1 corresponding to the stretching
vibrations of −OH groups, which was contributed by the coordinated
water.27,28 As the −OH group’s peak of
ZnAl2O4 prepared by the hydrothermal method
(ZnAl2O4–H) was stronger than the other
two, which indicated that the ZnAl2O4–H
had a higher density of surface −OH groups. The band at around
1632 cm–1 was present in all the samples, which
could be assigned to the H–O–H bending vibrations of
the adsorbed water molecule. The band at 1382 cm–1 was presented in the ZnAl2O4–H alone,
which was the OH group in the metal alkoxides.29 In all the samples, the bands at around 666, 558, and 506
cm–1 were assigned to stretching and bending modes
of the Al single bond O of octahedral AlO6 units; this
suggested that the normal spinel-type ZnAl2O4 structure was formed.

Figure 6 FT-IR patterns of ZnAl2O4 samples.

The chemical composition and relative
content of the surface element
for environmental material are important to the effects in application
of wastewater treatment.30−32 Therefore, XPS analysis was carried
out to explore the characteristics of the ZnAl2O4 surface (Figure 7). The wide XPS spectra of ZnAl2O4 contained
elements of Zn, Al, O, and C (Figure 7a), in which the presence of the carbon C 1s peak at
284.6 eV was mainly used to calibrate the binding energies of other
elements. Figure 7b–d
presents the O 1s spectra of the three catalysts with high resolution.
In addition, they were fitted by Gauss–Lorentzian peak shapes
with the nonlinear least-squares fit program. The results displayed
three peaks with binding energies at about 530.0, 531.1, and 532.5
eV. The signal at 530.0 eV possibly comes from AlOx (Osite1, Al in the AlO6 octahedral site
or AlO4 tetrahedral site).33 The peak at 531.1 eV can be ascribed to lattice oxygen (Osite2) in the ZnAl2O4 crystal lattice.34 Notably, the peak at 532.5 eV was assigned to
surface-adsorptive hydroxyl oxygen species (Osite3). The
relative content of Osite3 of catalyst samples can be calculated
by the fitted peak area presented in Table 1.30 It was shown
that the percentage of Osite3 for ZnAl2O4–H was 11.57%, which was higher than those of ZnAl2O4–S (8.6%) and ZnAl2O4–C (8.18%). Also, the Osite3 is taken as the initiators
for •OH generation,35 and it plays an important role in the ozonation process. Thus, the
analysis of XPS demonstrated that •OH could be the
active oxidative species in the presence of ZnAl2O4. Furthermore, the ZnAl2O4–H
which possesses the most percentage of Osite3 has a better
catalytic activity.

2.4 Catalyst Reusability
The reusability
of the catalyst is an important parameter for the consideration of
practice application in the future.36 To
investigate the reusability of catalyst samples, a specific experiment
was carried out to recycle the ZnAl2O4–H
three times under identical conditions. The catalyst particles were
separated with reaction solution by sediment and centrifugation, and
then they can be collected for a new cycle. As shown in Figure 8, the removal efficiency of
SSal was found to be 64.8–59.7% after being reused three times of catalyst, which
indicated that the catalytic activity of ZnAl2O4–H was not significantly changed after cycling. The results
suggested the high reusability and stability of ZnAl2O4 catalysts in the water treatment.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, nanocrystalline ZnAl2O4 was
prepared by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and coprecipitation methods.
In addition, the catalysts were applied in ozonation for the degradation
of pollutants. In the presence of three catalyst samples, the degradation
of SSal was significantly enhanced compared to ozonation alone. Furthermore,
the ZnAl2O4–H which was prepared by the
hydrothermal method possessed the simplest operation with one step
and displayed better catalytic activity in catalytic ozonation. Notably,
some characterizations of ZnAl2O4, such as FT-IR
and XPS, indicated that the surface of hydroxyl groups was the key
during the degradation experiments. In addition, surface hydroxyl
groups of the catalyst were regarded as the active sites for the generation
of •OH. Accordingly, the experiment of adding TBA
was done, which demonstrated that •OH was the active
oxidative species in catalytic ozonation with ZnAl2O4. On the other hand, ZnAl2O4–H
showed good recyclability by reusing the catalyst samples. This study
could provide a method for novel catalyst preparation and determine
the potentially promising applications of ZnAl2O4 in catalytic ozonation of wastewater treatment.

was selected as the
model pollutant, and it was obtained from J&K scientific Co.,
Ltd. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O] and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate [Al(NO3)3·9H2O] were purchased from Aladdin Reagent

Co., Ltd. Other reagents used in the work were of analytical grade.
Ultrapure water was used in the research from Mili-Q water (18.2 MΩ
cm in resistivity).

4.2 Preparation of ZnAl2O4
Three nanocrystalline ZnAl2O4 catalysts were synthesized
by hydrothermal, sol–gel, and coprecipitation methods.

Hydrothermal
Method
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (8 mmol), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (16
mmol), and urea (0.16 mol) were added into a 160 mL of mixture
solvent of water and ethanol (v/v = 1:1) with magnetic stirring. After
dissolving completely, the clear solution was transferred into a 200
mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and heated at 180 °C for
24 h. When it cooled to room temperature, the supernatant catalyst
was filtered by centrifugation, and then it was washed with ethanol
and ultrapure water until the pH value got to neutral. The obtained
catalyst was dried at 80 °C and denoted as ZnAl2O4–H.

Sol–Gel Method
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (8 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (16 mmol) were dissolved
in 80 mL of ultrapure
water, and then a mixture of metal nitrate (M1) was obtained. Then,
the citric acid was dissolved in ultrapure water (M2), with the molar
ratio of citric acid and the metal ions being 2:1. Then, M1 was added
dropwise into M2 while stirring continuously. After 10 min of stirring,
the solution was heated at 70 °C in a water bath until the sols
were formed. The transparent thick gels were formed and then maintained
at 150 °C for 2 h to obtain a fluffy polyporous powder. After
grinding, the abovementioned powder was calcined at 700 °C for
8 h in the muffle furnace and then annealed at 400 °C for 3 h;
it is denoted as ZnAl2O4–S.37

Coprecipitation Method
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (8 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (16 mmol) were dissolved
in 10 mL of ultrapure
water, wherein the molar ratio of Zn/Al was 1:2, and the two solutions
were mixed sufficiently. Then, the aqueous ammonia solution (25 wt
%) was dropped into the abovementioned solution, and the mixture was
stirred fully until complete precipitation. The precipitate was filtered
by centrifugation, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and dried
at 80 °C. Then, the dry product was calcined at 700 °C for
8 h and denoted as ZnAl2O4–C.

4.3 Characterization of ZnAl2O4
The composition and phase of samples were determined
by XRD with Cu Kα radiating (Rigaku D/MAX 2500 PC) under the
condition of 40 kV voltage, 300 mA tube current, and continuous scan
mode sampling. The scan speed was 4° min–1 with
a range of 10°–90°. The morphologies and size of
catalysts were characterized by TEM. For preparing the samples of
TEM, the powder of the catalyst need to be dispersed by ethanol and
then drops of each samples placed on a copper grid. Element composition
of samples was investigated by EDX. The FT-IR spectrum was recorded
on a Nicolet Magna-IR 6700 infrared spectrometer. The XPS was analyzed
using a PHI5700 spectrometer.

The density of surface hydroxyl
groups of catalysts was measured by a saturated deprotonating method.38 The procedure was as follows: 0.3 g of ZnAl2O4 was added to 50 mL of 2–100 mmol/L NaOH
solution, and the suspensions were shaken at 25 °C for 24 h.

The pH at the point of zero charge (pHpzc) of catalysts
was determined by a pH drift method.39 The
0.1 M NaCl solution was prepared as an electrolyte, and N2 was bubbled through the solution to expel the dissolved CO2. Then, the pH was adjusted to successive initial values by NaOH
and HNO3 as pHi. After that, the ZnAl2O4 (0.1 g) was added to the solution. These suspensions
were shaken for 24 h with the temperature at 25 °C. The final
pH was measured by a pH meter called pHf and using the
equation of ΔpH = pHf – pHi to
calculate a series of ΔpH. ΔpH was plotted against the
initial pH. The pH at which the curve crosses the X-axis is taken as the pHpzc.

4.4 Experimental
Procedures
The degradation
experimental equipment of SSal consisted of a cylindrical pyrex glass
reactor, an ozone generator (CFY-3, Hangzhou Rongxin Electronic Equipment
Co., Ltd., China), a mass flowmeter, and an exhaust treatment system.
The ozone reactor consists of three parts with inner pipe, outer pipe
and pedestal, and an ozone diffuser fixed in the bottom. When the
reaction started, as ozone was diffusing, the wastewater and catalyst
were flowed circularly between the two pipes, which formed a system
of a circulating fluidized bed. The initial concentration of SSal
is 500 mg/L, 1.5 L of SSal solution, and 0.30 g of catalyst was added
into the reactor, and then ozone was bubbled from the bottom continuously.
To test the performance of ZnAl2O4, other experiments
were carried out without the catalyst and absorption on the catalyst
under the same condition. In addition, x, the dosage of ozone, was
controlled by adjusting the mass flowmeter, the pH of SSal solution
was adjusted by HCl and NaOH, and pH was adjusted in 7.0 with ozonation
and catalytic ozonation. All the tests were performed three times,
and the final results were averaged.

The concentration of SSal
was analyzed by adding ferric ion in excess, for SSal can react with
the ferric ion to form the colored metal complex of [Fe(SSal)]3+, which presents characteristic absorbance at 500 nm.40 Before measuring, the pH value of samples was
adjusted to lower than 2.5 by 0.01 mol/L HClO4. The absorbance
of [Fe(SSal)]3+ was measured via a Hach UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Hach DR6000, USA).

The COD is CODcr and it was
analyzed by the fast digestion
spectrophotometric method. The samples were digested at 150 °C
for 2 h, and the absorbance was determined at 440 nm by the Hach UV–vis
spectrophotometer.
