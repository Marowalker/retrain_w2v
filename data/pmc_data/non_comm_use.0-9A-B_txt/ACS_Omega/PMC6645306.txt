Development
of advanced materials for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic
water splitting is the key in utilization of renewable energy. In
the present work, we have synthesized MoS2 nanoparticles
embedded over the graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)
layer for superior catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution process
(HER). The nanocomposite materials are characterized using different
spectroscopic and microscopic measurements. A Tafel slope of ∼40
mV/decade suggested the Volmer–Heyrovsky mechanism for the
HER process with MoS2/GO composite as the catalyst, which indicated that electrochemical
desorption of hydrogen is the rate-limiting step. The small Tafel
slope indicates a promising electrocatalyst for HER in practical application.
MoS2/GO composite material has shown superior catalytic
behavior compared to that of MoS2/rGO composite material.
The HER catalytic activity of the catalysts is explored using scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) using the feedback and redox competition
mode in SECM. The activation energy for HER activity was calculated,
and the values are in the range of 17–6 kJ/mol. The lower value
of activation energy suggested faster HER kinetics.

1 Introduction
The
limitation of petroleum fuels and global environmental pollution
encourage the researchers to think about an ideal, clean, and efficient
alternative source to traditional sources of energy. Hydrogen serves
as one of the important alternatives for replacing petroleum fuels
for the future. Traditional ways of production of hydrogen involve
release of the greenhouse gas CO2 and a high temperature
reaction, and the production of hydrogen through such processes are
being phased out.1 Generation of hydrogen
through electrochemical and photoelectrochemical splitting of water
is being considered as the favored route for the generation of hydrogen.
Such processes require a good electrochemical catalyst which should
be cost effective, environment friendly, efficient, and useful in
prolonged generation of hydrogen from the splitting of water. As an
electrocatalyst, the most important aspect is to decrease the overpotential
of splitting water.2 In acidic solution,
Pt group metals are most effective catalysts for the generation of
hydrogen but due to the high cost of the Pt group metal elements,
large-scale application using these elements is not feasible.3 Because of the earth’s abundant nature,
different transition metal alloys, carbides, polymeric carbon nitrides,
and transition metal chalcogenides have been investigated for the
hydrogen evolution process (HER) catalysis.4 Molybdenum di-sulfide has been preferred as a catalyst for HER due
to the low cost and high chemical stability.5 The HER catalytic activity of MoS2 has been discussed
comparing the activity of its 1T and 2H phases. The catalytic activity
of 2H phase is mostly through the edges of the catalytic system, and
this has been supported using experimental and theoretical studies,6 and the basal plane was found to have no significant
catalytic activity. Therefore, to improve the catalytic activity using
2H-MoS2, it is essential to have a higher percentage of
active edge sites and there has been some report about the catalytic
HER reaction using 2H-MoS2 phase.7 The activity of the MoS2 has also been investigated to
improve the catalytic activity by making nanophase-based materials.
Electrical conductivity of the material has been improved by incorporating
Co, Ni, or Fe into nanoscaled MoS2.8 Incorporation of Au,9 activated carbon,10 carbon paper,11 or
graphite12 has also been reported to have
improved catalytic activity.

There has been tremendous improvement
in the electrical conductivity
of 1T-MoS2 compared to 2H-MoS2, and this has
been reflected in the improvement of the HER activity.13 Even the basal plane of the 1T-MoS2 is quite electrochemically active for the HER catalytic activity.13 Therefore, if 1T phase of MoS2 is
formed, there should not be any limitation of its use only through
the edge planes. Conductivity of graphene is well understood and accepted
for the fabrication of nanophase composite materials of high conductivity.14 The growth of the catalyst nanophases all over
the graphene substrate has further improved the charge-transport property
of the catalysts and hence enhanced the HER activity.4a

In a previous report, good charge-transfer property
between the
adjacent layers of MoS2 and graphene has been reported,15 which has been the key point in making MoS2 graphene composites as HER catalysts. Therefore, 1T-MoS2, with a highly conducting basal plane, when forming composite
with graphene, would be the favorable combination for effective transformation
into an HER catalyst. Under the present investigation, 1T phase of
MoS2 has been synthesized through the hydrothermal route
and the improvement in the catalytic activity of the 1T phase when
forming a composite with graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) has been investigated. Because the entanglement of MoS2 between the GO and rGO substrate would have some differences,
it would be interesting to observe the possible differences in their
catalytic activities. The scanning probe electrochemical technique
and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) experiments have been
employed to map the catalyst substrate using the redox completion
mode, and this has reflected the difference in the catalytic behavior
between the two composite materials. Probe approach plots at different
applied potentials and their transformation from the positive to the negative feed due to the introduction of the redox competition
mode between the tip and the substrate has been investigated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the
Materials
MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO samples
were characterized
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the diffraction patterns are shown
in Figure 1A,B, respectively.
Three diffraction peaks 2θ = 12, 43, and 57.5° correspond
to (002), (006), and (110) planes of MoS2, respectively
[powder diffraction file (PDF no. 37-1492)], which is due to the metallic
1T structure of MoS2.16 The
intensity corresponding to the (002) plane of MoS2/GO is
much lower than that of MoS2/rGO, which suggests that the
lower stacking height is along Z-axis with more exposure
of its active sites. The 1T phase of MoS2 with a trigonal
crystal structure and octahedral orientation is shown to have significant
difference in the electronic property compared with the hexagonal
2H phase.17

diffraction (SAED) patterns of (D–F) pristine MoS2 and (G–I) MoS2/rGO. TEM and SAED patterns of MoS2/GO are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

Raman spectroscopy was
used for further characterization of phases
of MoS2. The three peaks at 283, 365, and 414 cm–1 correspond to the hexagonal vibration modes E1g, 1E2g, and A1g of MoS2, respectively.
The in-plane 1E2g and out-of-plane A1g vibrational mode resulted from the opposite vibration of the S atom
with respect to the Mo atom, and out-of-plane vibration of only S
atom to Mo atom18 suggests the formation
of pure MoS2 phase. The two bands at 1357 and 1577 cm–1 corresponding to the D and G band are clear evidence
of graphene sheets in the nanocomposite. As shown in Figure 1C, the ID/IG ratios of graphene oxide and
reduced graphene oxide composite were calculated as 0.92 and 1.07,
respectively, which confirmed that GO is reduced to rGO.19 No significant change in the vibrational mode
was observed with the MoS2 phase during the reduction of
GO to rGO. The surface area was measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method, and the values for MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO
were obtained as 65 and 79 m2/g, respectively.

The
morphology and lattice parameters were characterized by SEM
and TEM images. Figure 1D,G shows the SEM micrograph of the pristine MoS2 and
the MoS2/rGO composite materials. The granular nature
of the composite for the MoS2 and sheet-type nature of
composite for the MoS2/rGO composite were observed. TEM
images of pristine MoS2 and MoS2/rGO are shown
in Figure 1E,H, respectively,
and the TEM images of MoS2/GO are shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information; both
the composite materials have shown a layer type of structure. The
selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) of MoS2 has shown
the (002) plane and the (110) plane of MoS2. The random
interconnection between the GO or rGO and MoS2 network
and random stacking of the (002) plane is vulnerable in MoS2 for the decrease in the catalytic activity.20 The clear observation of the (002) plane from the SEM and TEM measurements
rule out the random stacking of the MoS2 network. The TEM
and SAED of the MoS2/GO nanocomposite materials shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information showed
nanostructural characteristics similar to those of the MoS2/rGO.

The SEM images with EDS results of both the materials
are shown
in Figure 2. The presence
of Mo and S along with C and O is observed. The surface morphology
of the catalyst-modified substrate was examined using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) measurements using the MoS2/GO-modified
substrate. The morphology has shown a regular granular pattern of
the catalyst embedded all over the GO substrate, and the morphology
of MoS2/rGO is shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. The average particle size (diameter)
for MoS2/GO was obtained as 60 nm (the corresponding histograms
are shown in Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information).

2.2 Electrocatalytic HER Activity
The
electrochemical HER activity of the catalyst was investigated in 0.5
M H2SO4 solution by depositing catalyst ink
on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) using the three-electrode system,
as discussed in the Experimental Procedures. In the polarization curve, the potential is corrected with iR drop and with the potential with respect to the reversible
hydrogen electrode (RHE). The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic
voltammetry (CV) plots for both the catalysts along with the commercially
available Pt/C catalyst are shown in Figure 3. The LSV plots of both of the composite
materials have shown a sharp increase in the catalytic hydrogen evolution
current after the onset potential. The onset potential for the MoS2/GO is lower by ∼0.13 V than that for MoS2/rGO; however, when compared with the Pt/C catalyst, both the materials
have shown good electrocatalytic properties and the onset potential
is not so inferior to that of the commercially available Pt/C catalyst
materials. As seen from Figure 3A, the catalytic activity of the only GO and only rGO-modified
electrode has shown no reduction current due to the reduction of proton.
Therefore the GO and rGO played only a synergistic role in catalyzing
the hydrogen evolution process along with MoS2. The onset
position of the LSV plots was zoomed and shown as the inset of Figure 3A,B; the reduction
current in both the composite materials started increasing at 0.2
V and separated from the base line current of the GO and rGO composite-modified
substrates. A peak shape was generated at −0.027 V, just before
the onset potential for the hydrogen evolution process. This reduction
peak is the partial reduction of MoS2 at the Mo4+ center; later, it was oxidized back to its original oxidation state.21

image
at lower current density is shown as the inset. (B) Polarization curve
of catalysts with and without the hydrodynamic effect. The magnified
image at lower current density is shown as the inset. (C) Effects
of the scan rate on current density. (D) Effect of hydrodynamic conditions
on the catalytic activity.

The LSV plots were further recorded under hydrodynamic conditions,
and corresponding results in comparison with the data under static
condition are shown in Figure 3B. At 1500 rpm, the onset potential was improved in both the
composite materials compared to that in the static condition. However,
the catalytic current at higher applied potential, beyond −0.15
V, remained the same at static and hydrodynamic conditions. Interestingly,
the peak current for the peak observed just before the onset potential
was increased under hydrodynamic conditions. LSVs were also compared
at two different rotation speeds, as shown in Figure 3C, the onset potential of the hydrogen evolution
process was improved in both the materials when the rotation speed
was increased from 500 to 3000 rpm. The improvement in the catalytic
activity at the low-current region due to the hydrodynamic conditions
is due to the enhanced mass transfer attained by the hydrodynamic
mass flow.

From the LSV measurements, as discussed in the previous
section,
the MoS2/GO has shown better catalytic activity for the
hydrogen evolution process in terms of the better onset potential
and the high catalytic current density. To delineate the better catalytic
activity of the MoS2/GO composite, the electrochemical
surface area of the catalyst surface was measured from the double-layer
capacitance (Cdl) measurements. CV experiments
were carried out at different scan rates, as shown in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information, and
the current sampled at three potentials 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 V, where
no significant redox process observed, was plotted with respect to
the applied scan rates. The results are shown in Figure 3C; from the slope of the linear
plot, the double-layer capacitance was determined and tabulated in Table 1. The “Cdl” value was calculated from the slope
of the current density and scan rate plot.22

0.15	5.58 × 10–4	9.3

The Cdl values of MoS2/GO
and MoS2/rGO are obtained as 0.34 and 0.72 mF, respectively.
The effect of hydrodynamics on the Cdl value shows that the Cdl value increases
for MoS2/rGO from 0.72 to 0.87 mF; however, the Cdl value decreases for MoS2/GO from
0.34 to 0.27 mF. The roughness factor was calculated from the double-layer
capacitance using the following equation 1  where, the value “60” represents
the specific capacitance of a smooth surface in μF cm–2.23 As seen from Table 1, the Rf value
for MoS2/rGO is higher than that of MoS2/GO,
so it is HER activity should have been higher than that of MoS2/GO; however, the polarization curve shows that MoS2/GO has better catalytic activity. This contradicts the above observation.
Therefore, the observation of higher catalytic activity in the case
of MoS2/GO compared to that in the case of MoS2/rGO indicates that the higher catalytic current in the case of MoS2/GO is not related to the surface area of the materials and
has something to do with the inherent characteristics of the HER process
over the catalyst’s substrate.

The improvement of the
onset potential due to the introduction
of the hydrodynamic conditions has been mentioned with the discussion
of the results in Figure 3. Hydrodynamic conditions were further discussed by determining
the kinetic parameters. As shown in Figure 3D, no significant effect of rotation on catalytic
activity was observed at the higher overpotential range but at lower
overpotential the catalytic current is modified significantly. At
2 mA/cm2 current density, the applied potential was improved
by 13.1 mV in the case of MoS2/GO and improved by 7.4 mV
in the case of MoS2/rGO when the rotation speed was increased
from 500 to 3000 rpm. Detailed kinetic information about the contribution
from the mass flow and the charge-transfer kinetics was investigated
by introducing the Koutechy–Levich analysis24 using the equations as follows   2  where ik = nFAkC0 and B = 0.2nFC0D2/3ν–1/6 and, i, ik, and il are the measured current, kinetic current,
and limiting current, respectively. ω is the rotation rate of
the electrode in rpm. k is electron-transfer rate
constant; n is the number of electron transfers; F = 96 500 C/mol; A is the surface
area of RDE in cm2; C0 is the
concentration of H+ in bulk solution in mol/cm3; D is the diffusion coefficient of proton in 0.5
M H2SO4, and its value corresponds to 9.3 ×
10–5 cm2 s–1; and ν
is the kinematic viscosity of 0.5 M H2SO4, and
its value is 0.01 cm2 s–1.25 Currents were sampled at different applied potentials
of the LSV plot (Figure 4) during the Koutechy–Levich analysis, and the corresponding
kinetic parameters for both the composite materials are shown in Table 2. At a lower applied
potential below the onset potential, the number of electrons transferred
was obtained as close to one, at a higher applied potential (at −0.21
V) the number of electrons transferred increased significantly. Such
an unreasonably high value of the number of electrons transferred
for the HER process is accounted for by the enhanced mass flow which
resulted in the increased surface concentration of the H+ compared to its bulk concentration. The electron-transfer rate constant
of the HER process in MoS2/rGO catalyst was marginally
higher than that in the MoS2/GO catalytic system (Table 3).

Temperature-dependent electrochemical measurements
were carried
out in a custom-made cell, in which water can be filled in the outer
jacket for temperature control; corresponding results for the MoS2/GO materials are shown in Figure 5A. The reference electrode was corrected
for temperature using the following equation.26 3  LSVs at different temperatures varying from
5 to 70 °C were recorded. The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was
calibrated for different temperatures using the above equation. Figure 5A shows the temperature-dependent
LSV for the MoS2/GO catalyst, and the results indicated
the improvement of the onset potential for the HER process with rise
in temperature. Corresponding results for the MoS2/rGO
composite materials are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information. To evaluate and extract the activity
of the electrocatalysts, the apparent activation energy for hydrogen
evolution (Eaapp) is estimated
using the following equation.27 4  where Eaapp is evaluated at different applied potentials, i is the current density at a given applied potential, T is the absolute temperature, and R is the universal
gas constant. After recording the LSVs at different temperatures,
the observed currents were sampled at three different applied potentials
and ln i versus 1/T plots
at three different applied potentials are shown in the inset of Figure 5A. It was observed
that the slopes of the plots were decreased with the application of
more cathodic potential, indicating potential-dependent apparent activation
energy for the overall process. The apparent activation energy for
MoS2/GO composite material is relatively lower than that
of the MoS2/rGO at all applied potentials. Because the
activation energy is calculated from the change in the overall current
with the change in temperature of the process (mass transfer and charge
transfer), the effect of
the change in temperature will be reflected in the activation energy
calculation. Therefore, the relatively low activation energy in MoS2/GO material might be due to the enhanced mass transfer compared
to that of MoS2/rGO.

Tafel plot of the two-catalyst
system in comparison with that of the standard Pt/C catalyst; (C)
stability test using chronopotentiometry; and (D) stability test using
chronoamperometry of MoS2/GO catalyst.

Tafel treatment was applied to the LSV plot, and the linear
portion
of the Tafel plot in Figure 5B was fitted using the Tafel equation, η = a + b log j, where j is the current density and b is the Tafel
slope. The Tafel slopes for the corresponding catalyst materials MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO are obtained as ≈ 40.6
and ≈ 71.8 mV/decade, respectively. The overpotential is iRs-corrected and on the scale of the RHE value,
as shown in eq 9. The
Tafel slope is used to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the HER
process. There are three possible reaction steps in acidic aqueous
medium for the HER process.28 First, the
discharge step (Volmer reaction) 5  where the Tafel
slope, b =
2.3RT/α, F ≈ 120 mV/decade, R is the universal gas constant, T is the
absolute temperature, α = 0.5 is the symmetry coefficient, and F is the Faraday constant. The second step is the combination
step (Tafel reaction) 6    The third step is the electrochemical desorption
step (Heyrovsky reaction) 7    The Tafel slope is an inherent property of
the catalyst that is determined by the rate-limiting step of the HER
process. Generally, the fast-discharging step 5 is followed by either the combination step 6 or electrochemical desorption step 7. If the
fast-discharging step 5 is followed by the rate-limiting
combination step 6, the Tafel slope will be
∼30 mV/decade; in this case, the overall mechanism of the process
would be the Volmer–Tafel mechanism. If the fast-discharging
step 5 is followed by slow electrochemical desorption
step 7, the Tafel slope will be ∼40 mV/decade
and in that case, the HER mechanism would be the Volmer–Heyrovsky
mechanism. When the electrochemical discharging step is the rate-limiting
step, the Tafel plot will be ∼120 mV/decade and the mechanism
will be through the Volmer step as the rate-determining step.28,29

The observed Tafel slope of ∼40.6 mV/decade in the
present
case, as seen from Figure 5B for the MoS2/GO hybrid catalyst, suggests that
the electrochemical desorption step would be the rate-limiting step
of the present system. In the case of the MoS2/rGO hybrid
catalyst, the Tafel slope was observed as 71.8 mV/decade. The mechanism
of the hydrogen evolution process over the MoS2 catalytic
system is such that the discharge step predominates over the Mo center
and S and graphene centers are responsible for the adsorption and
further recombination process for liberating hydrogen gas out of the
catalytic system. Mo centers are similar in both the catalytic systems,
and the major difference would arise due to the difference in the
GO and rGO in the catalysts. The significantly higher Tafel slope
in the case of the MoS2/rGO hybrid catalyst system is indicative
of mixed mechanism operating across the catalyst substrate. A part
of the catalyst substrate having Mo centers would have a fast discharge
process, whereas the rest of the surfaces result in the slow discharge
kinetics making the overall Tafel slope high.7c,30 In the case of the MoS2/GO hybrid catalyst system, there
are plenty of exchangeable H+ ions all over the matrix;
because of such exchange of H+ ions between the solution
and the −COOH and −OH groups present over the catalytic
substrate, the discharge step would be quite fast.31 The electrochemical reduction of H+ has been
consolidated and presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism of the HER Process over the MoS2/GO
Substrate
Furthermore, the stability
of the catalyst was tested by the chronopotentiometry
and chronoamperometry method. Chronopotentiometry experiments were
carried out at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 for 4 h.
As seen from the results in Figure 5C, the MoS2/GO catalyst is quite stable
at the experimental time period and the applied potential remained
below −0.25 V for the chosen current density. Chronoamperometric
experiments were carried out at an applied potential of −0.20
V, and it was observed that after an initial drop in current, it remained
stable for the experimental time period of 4 h. Even though the 1T
phase of MoS2 is said to be in the metastable phase, composites
of 1T-MoS2 have been stable even after long-term testing.13a GO and rGO might have an important role in
stabilizing the 1T-MoS2 phase on prolonged HER catalysis.

The catalyst-modified electrode was examined using AFM measurements
after the stability test, that is, the chronoamperometric experiments,
for 4 h. As seen from Figure 2D, the general morphology of the materials remained similar
to that of what there was before the electrochemical test. From the
histogram and AFM micrograph (Figures S3 and S4 of the Supporting Information), the average particle size was decreased
from 60 to 40 nm after the electrochemical test. The layered structure
of composite materials well appears after the electrochemical test.
Because of the energetic changes during the electrochemical test,
the materials might have relaxed, which has resulted in the minor
modification in the morphology of the composite materials. A similar
observation was reported previously on the Mo oxide materials, where
in prolonged electrochemical cycles, the size of the Mo oxide nanoparticles
was decreased; such decrease in the size of the nanoparticles and
the morphological change were described due to the redox activities
at the catalytic center in prolonged electrochemical cycles.32

2.3 Electrochemical Impedance
Measurements
The charge-transfer efficiency of the electrocatalyst
was investigated
by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using the CH Instrument
by applying an alternating current voltage of 10 mV amplitude in a
frequency range of 100 000–0.1 Hz. Corresponding results
in the form of the Nyquist plot and the circuit used for fitting the
Nyquist plot are shown in Figure 6. The zoomed portion of the high-frequency region of
the Nyquist plot is shown as the inset of Figure 6. The Nyquist plot was characterized with
two semicircular regions, one at a high frequency and the other at
the low frequency. The Nyquist plots were fitted with the equivalent
circuit model, as shown in Figure 6. Here, Rs represents solution
resistance, R1 is the charge-transfer
resistance, and R2 is the resistance incorporated
to account for the second semicircle.30a,33 The total
resistance for the Faradaic process of HER is the sum of R1 and R2. From Figure 6A, the R1 value for MoS2/GO is 6 Ω, which is lower
than that of MoS2/rGO, 8 Ω. The value of R2 in the case of MoS2/GO (32 Ω)
is significantly lower than that in the case of MoS2/rGO
(120 Ω). Corresponding to the mechanism of the overall process,
as discussed in the Tafel analysis, the resistance R1 corresponds to the Volmer step and the resistance at
the low-frequency region R2 corresponds
to the desorptive charge-transfer process, the Heyrovsky step. A smaller
value of R1 in both the materials suggests
a better charge-transfer possibility. The semicircular loop at the
low-frequency region corresponds to the desorptive charge-transfer
process, and this process has a dominant role in the overall HER kinetics.
A considerably low value of this desorptive resistance in the case
of MoS2/GO composite material compared to that in the case
of MoS2/rGO material has indicated that the difference
between the HER activity between these two materials is due to the
difference in this adsorption resistance.34 The Bode phase plot is shown as the inset of Figure 6A, and it has been observed that at 0.215
V of overpotential, the phase angle maxima value is 37° for GO
composite, which is smaller than that of the rGO composite at 44°.
The lower phase angle maxima suggests an improved Faradaic process
in the case of GO composite materials compared to that in the case
of rGO composite materials.35 Similar to
the CV measurements, the roughness factor (Rf) was determined from the capacitance value obtained from
the impedance measurements and the values are obtained as 4.33 and
11.5 for MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO composite materials,
respectively.

and the corresponding Bode plot at the entire frequency range. (B)

Additionally, the phase angle
maxima for the relaxation process
associated with surface intermediates falls in the range of 10–100
Hz. The relaxation frequencies for MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO composites are 100 and 20.89 Hz, respectively. This relaxation
process is due to the nonhomogeneous charge transfer by the surface
species. Above the onset potential of hydrogen evolution, the relaxation
due to nonhomogeneous charge distribution dominates, with a minor
contribution from the double-layer capacitance and charge-transfer
components, as shown in Figure 6A. However, the phase angle maxima for the GO composite being
at a higher frequency than that of the rGO composite suggests that
there is significant masking due to the double-layer capacitance on
the HER activity in the case of the GO composite. This double-layer
masking effect should limit the performance of MoS2/GO
composite but the performance of MoS2/GO is better than
that of rGO, as shown in Figure 6A. This anomalous property can be explained through
the functionalized GO with hydroxyl and carboxylic acid groups that
might increase the double-layer masking and at the same time increase
the mass flow of protons through the exchange mechanism from the acidic solution, as shown in Scheme 1.

2.4 Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy Measurements
Scanning
electrochemical microscopy (SECM) was employed to characterize
the charge-transport processes and to obtain the local electrochemical
activity of the substrates. A Pt ultramicro electrode (UME) of diameter
10 μm was used as the working electrode (probe or tip electrode),
Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, the saturated Ag/AgCl electrode
as the reference electrode, and the glassy carbon electrode (GCE)
modified by the catalyst was used as the substrate electrode. The
approach of probe to the surface of the catalyst was performed by
the probe approach curve (PAC) technique, in which a constant potential
of −0.075 V versus RHE was applied to the probe and different
potentials in the range from 0.225 to −0.175 V were applied
to the substrate. Electrochemical signals were measured by measuring
the current at the UME tip as a function of the precise tip position
over the substrate at the approach distance, and the SECM imaging
was obtained. The steady-state probe current is given by36 8  where Id is the
diffusion-limited current, n is the number of electrons transferred at the electrode tip, F is Faraday’s constant, C is the
concentration of H+ ions in solution, D is the diffusion coefficient, and a is the radius
of the UME disk. In bulk solution, H+ ions got reduced
at the UME tip and produced a steady-state current limited by hemispherical
diffusion. As the tip approached the substrate, the hydrogen atom
formed after reduction of the H+ ions at the tip oxidized
at the substrate, when the potential applied at the substrate is more
positive than the tip potential and a positive feedback response was
observed;36b although the catalyst substrate
was not meant for the oxidation of hydrogen to proton, at an applied
positive potential it should oxidize hydrogen to proton. Feedback
responses at different substrate potentials are shown in Figure 7, where the normalized
current, the tip current during approach (iT), is divided by the steady-state tip current when the tip was in
the bulk solution (iTinf), which is plotted
with respect to the normalized distance L (d/a), where d is the tip-to-substrate
distance and “a” is the radius of the
tip electrode. Positive feedback response was obtained when the substrate
potential was more positive or equal to the tip potential, and negative
feedback responses were obtained when substrate potentials were more
negative than the tip potential. This is due to the enhanced mass
flow of H+ to the tip at a relatively positive applied
potential at the substrate. The negative feedback response was due
to the redox competition between the tip and the substrate. When the
potential at the substrate was same or more negative, reduction of
H+ ions became prominent at the substrate; hence, negative
feedback responses were obtained. Therefore, at the same applied potential
to the tip and the substrate, the substrate could impose a negative
feedback response to the tip due to the introduction of the redox
competition mode into the system. This is essentially due to the higher
surface area of the substrate and also the good catalytic activity
of the substrate. The feedback responses were fitted with standard
models, as seen from Figure 7, where most of the positive feedback responses could be fitted
reasonably well; however, the negative feedback responses could not
be fitted due to the redox completion mode operating between the tip
and the substrate.

catalyst

V, (D) −0.075 V, (E) −0.08 V, (F) −0.125 V, and
(G) −0.175 V, keeping a constant probe potential at −0.075
V.

After the probe approached the
substrate, the catalyst-modified
substrate was scanned for the electrochemical imaging of the substrate
by SECM using the steady-state current response from the tip.36a The SECM scanning was carried out in the constant
height mode, where the distance between the probe and the substrate
was kept constant at the approach distance of 1.1 μm and the
probe was scanned in the X–Y plane. The SECM scans for the MoS2/GO materials are shown
in Figure 8. It was
observed that at the relatively positive substrate potential, the
overall probe current was high all over the substrate; there were
some high-current regions spread across the whole substrate. With
a shift in the applied potential toward more negative direction, the
spread of the high-current regions were decreased and only a few high-current
inlands were observed at the substrate potential of 0.025 V. At −0.075
V, the transition potential between the positive and the negative
feedback response, the entire substrate was covered with low current
response. At further negative applied potential to the substrate,
the probe recorded very low negative currents across the substrate
with some inlands of positive current, as seen in Figure 8E. The positive current response
from the probe was further increased at even more negative applied
potential to the substrate (cf. Figure 8F). The probe approach plots and the SECM scans for
the MoS2/rGO materials are shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. A nearly similar
observation as that for the MoS2/GO hybrid material was
observed in the probe approach plot and SECM scan at different potentials.
When the corresponding figures of Figure 8E,F were compared with Figure S7E,F, it was observed that the positive current response
from the tip was higher in the case of MoS2/GO than in
the case of MoS2/rGO. Thus, the more prominent positive
current response at the substrate potentials of −0.125 and
−0.175 V in the case of MoS2/GO hybrid materials
compared to that in the case of the MoS2/rGO hybrid material,
indicates a better catalytic hydrogen evolution process over the MoS2/GO. SECM was used previously for the investigation of HER
processes and it was reported that the strained S vacancy of MoS2 has much higher HER activity than an unstrained one.37 The present result on SECM revealed that both
the composite materials have imposed the oxidation reaction at the
Pt tip at an applied substrate potential of −0.075 V; however,
the oxidation process at the tip due to the redox competition process
is induced predominantly by the MoS2/GO composite materials
than the MoS2/rGO composite materials. Both the materials
have shown good catalytic activity for the HER process, with relatively
higher activity for MoS2/GO composite material, which has
been revealed from the LSV measurements and supported by the impedance
and hydrodynamic measurements. Previous investigation on SECM with
surface interrogation has revealed the Mo–H bond formation
during the HER catalysis process using MoS2 catalyst.38 This Mo–H bond formation might be facilitated
due to the presence of adjacent exchangeable protons in MoS2/GO composite materials.

V, (C) 0.025 V, (D) −0.075 V, (E) −0.125 V, and (F)
−0.175 V.

The difference in the
work function between graphene and MoS2 has been favorable
for the electron to flow from MoS2 toward the graphene
sheet; good coupling between the MoS2 and the graphene
sheet would always make this flow of electron
fast for an efficient HER process.15

The present observation of the enhanced HER process in the case
MoS2/GO composite materials is explained from the direction
of the electron flow from MoS2 to the graphene sheets.
The electron would transfer from the electrode to MoS2,
which will further be transferred to the graphene sheet, from which
the electron will be transferred to H+ ions, and the charge-transfer
reaction will take place for the HER catalytic reaction. Because there
are exchangeable protons already present in the graphene sheet of
GO, the overall charge-transfer process would always be favored in
the case of MoS2/GO composite materials compared with MoS2/rGO composite materials.39

3 Conclusions
The composites of GO ad rGO with the MoS2 have been
synthesized. Material characterization has revealed the 1T phase of
MoS2. Both the composite materials have shown very good
catalytic activity for HER process and their catalytic activities
are not so inferior to the commercially available Pt/C catalyst. Electrochemical
investigations with Tafel analysis have indicated the Volmer–Heyrovsky
mechanism for the HER process in the MoS2/GO catalytic
system. LSV experiments were carried out in the hydrodynamic mode
and the results are shown to have a marginally higher electron-transfer
rate constant for MoS2/rGO composite materials, where the
current density and the onset potential for the HER process was comparatively
favorable in the case of MoS2/GO. Such anomaly in the observation
has indicated the enhanced mass transfer process for MoS2/GO; such enhanced mass transfer has been ascertained from the exchange
of proton at the functional group over the GO matrix and the bulk
acidic solution. Electrochemical impedance measurements have shown
to have high desorptive charge-transfer resistance for MoS2/rGO composite material responsible for the comparatively low HER.
SECM experiments were carried out using the catalyst-modified substrate,
and the probe approach plot has shown the transformation of the composite-modified
electrode as the substrate from oxidation of proton to the efficient
HER catalyst with the modulation of the applied potential. The SECM
substrate scan has shown the enhanced oxidation current from the tip
electrode at a cathodic applied potential to the MoS2/GO
composite-modified substrate compared to that in the MoS2/rGO composite-modified substrate.

4 Experimental
Procedures
4.1 Preparation of MoS2 Nanoparticle
MoS2 was synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Ammonium
molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.44 gm) was dissolved in 5 mL of deionized
water and then hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O, 86%, 4 mL) as the reducing agent was added dropwise under
stirring condition. The reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 h, and
then sodium sulfide (Na2S, 1.32 g) dissolved in 5 mL of
deionized water was added into it; then, the mixture was left for
10 min for incubation; 5 mL of 2 M HCl was added dropwise to that
mixture. Then, the reaction mixture was left for 10 min again for
incubation. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was transferred into
a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C
for 24 h. After 24 h, the autoclave was allowed to cool at room temperature
and then black product was washed with distilled water several times
and then with ethanol. The product, as obtained, was dried at 60 °C
for 12 h in the vacuum oven. The mole ratio of the reactants was kept
at Mo/N2H4/Na2S of 1:357:48 during
the synthesis process.

4.2 Synthesis of Graphene Oxide
Graphene
oxide was synthesized using the modified Hummer’s method.40 Concentrated H2SO4 (300
mL) and H3PO4 (40 mL) were taken in a round-bottomed
(RB) flask of 1 L capacity. The RB flask was kept in an ice bath at
0–5 °C. The whole setup was kept in a magnetic stirrer;
then, graphite (2 g) powder was added into the RB flask slowly and the mixture was kept for stirring
for 2 h. Then, KMnO4 (12 g) was added slowly to this mixture
under stirring condition; this reaction mixture was stirred for 3
days at room temperature. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was kept
in an ice bath; H2O2 (20 mL) was added slowly
to terminate the reaction, followed by washing with HCl (10%) and
then distilled water several times to achieve the neutral pH. The
graphene oxide thus obtained was dried in a vacuum oven and used for
further experiments. Graphene oxide was reduced by treating GO suspended
aqueous solution using hydrazine monohydrate by stirring for 1 h,
and then the solution mixture was kept under hydrothermal conditions
at 180 °C for 12 h. The rGO thus obtained was washed and dried
for further use.

4.3 Procedure of Electrochemical
Studies and Instrumentation
MoS2 and GO or rGO
were mixed in mortar (in 1:4 ratios).
Then, 1 mg of the sample mixture was suspended in ethanol and water
solution (in a 1:1 ratio) and kept in stirring conditions for 24 h.
The suspension was sonicated for 1 h, and then 100 μL of nafion
(5 wt %) was added and again sonicated for 30 min. After sonication,
a homogeneous mixture was formed and then 5 μL of catalyst ink
was drop-casted onto the glassy carbon (GC) electrode, which then
dried under an IR lamp. Electrochemical measurement for the hydrogen
evolution catalysis process was carried out using the CH Instrument
model 920D. Electrochemical studies were performed in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using a typical three-electrode setup
using the catalyst-modified electrode as the working electrode, Pt
wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference
electrode. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV)
were performed to evaluate HER performance. The glassy carbon electrode
was polished to a mirror finish using alumina powder of 0.05 μm
size and ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water for 10 min, followed
by drying in an IR lamp. The electrolyte solution was purged with N2 gas for
30 min prior to the electrochemical measurements to remove dissolved
oxygen. Before measurements, the samples were cycled at a scan rate
of 10 mV s–1 50 times to refresh the catalytic surface.
All of the electrochemical measurements are reported against the potential
versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as the reference electrode.
The Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated in a three-electrode
system using a cleaned Pt electrode as the working electrode and Pt
wire as the counter electrode. H2SO4 solution
(0.5 M) was used as electrolyte which is purged using high purity H2 gas before and during measurements. LSVs were recorded at the scan
rate of 1 mV s–1, and the potential where the current
was zero is taken as the reference potential of the hydrogen electrode
and was found to be −0.2246 V from Figure S8. All of the electrochemical potentials applied and measured
using the Ag/AgCl reference electrode were converted to RHE using
the following equation; in addition to conversion of the potential
with respect to RHE, potentials were also corrected for the iRs drop. 9  where, EAg/AgCl is the Ag/AgCl electrode potential, 0.2246 V is the corrected potential, Rs is the resistance of solution, iRs is the potential drop due to solution resistance that
is measured using electrochemical impedance measurements reported
in the later section of this article.

All of the measurements
were iRs-compensated in the present study, and the values of Rs were found by conducting impedance measurement in 0.5
M H2SO4 and were in the range of 6–7
Ω for both MoS2/GO and MoS2/rGO composite
materials. The temperature during electrochemical measurements was
25 ± 1°C. The overpotential “η” for
hydrogen evolution was calculated using the following equation 10  Atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was
used for the chemical quantification of the
catalyst; the Mo content was determined using the AAS instrument model
Contra AA-300 from Analyticjena, Germany. The Mo content in both the
samples were quantified at 20% (wt %). The presence of GO and rGO
in the composite was determined by measuring the total carbon content
in the sample using a carbon sulfur analyzer from Eltra. The GO and
the rGO contents of the sample were kept the same, and the percentage
composition of GO and rGO in the catalysts sample were determined
at ∼60%.
