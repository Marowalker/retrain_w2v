Appropriately functionalized pillar[n]arenes are elegant supramolecular hosts
for ion and molecule sensing. A water-soluble decaamine derivative
of pillar[5]arene (APA) bearing triazole and amide moieties
is synthesized. The ion and molecular recognition properties of APA are studied by fluorescence, UV–visible, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The APA selectively detects Fe3+ among 11 studied ions,
which are important in several biological processes. Moreover, the
in situ prepared Fe3+ complex of APA (FeAPA) exhibits the highest responsiveness toward F– (∼12-fold) among 11 anions and cysteine (∼120-fold)
among the 20 naturally occurring amino acids by a fluorescence turn-on
mechanism.

==== Body
Introduction
Detection of ions and molecules is paramount in biology because
of their involvement in various physiological processes. Owing to
the existence of more than one oxidation state, transition-metal ions,
such as iron, the most important trace element in the human body,
are involved in a number of electron transfer as well as oxidoreductase
processes.1,2 Both deficiency and excess accumulation
of iron are harmful to life and lead to a number of diseases in humans.3,4 Similarly, fluoride ions have several advantages, especially in
preventing tooth decay as well as in the treatment of osteoporosis,
while their excess intake may be detrimental to life.5,6 Being the fundamental unit of proteins and an integral part of numerous
biological processes, amino acids play vital roles in biology. Among
the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, l-cysteine plays
an important role in living systems, and its deficiency may cause
several medical conditions, such as lethargy, liver damage, skin lesions,
weakness, etc.7−9 Hence, easy detection of biologically relevant ions
and molecules have gained increasing attention among researchers.

Several macrocycles such as crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes,
cucurbiturils, and pillararenes are known for selective sensing of
ions and molecules in both organic and aqueous solvents.10−16 Their unique shape, ease of synthesis, versatile functionalization,
tunable solubility, and ability to form host–guest complexes
account for their significance in supramolecular chemistry.17−20 Pillararenes are relatively new additions into the family of macrocycles,
and their unique pillarlike shape and the presence of two reactive
phenolic groups at the para positions rendered them
inevitable in molecular recognition and in the fabrication of supramolecular
systems.19,21 Recently, pillararene-based systems have
found excellent applications in the areas of sensors, supramolecular
polymers, molecular devices, drug delivery, etc.21−29 Recent studies demonstrated the detection of Fe3+ by
a 2-mercaptobenzothiazole derivative of pillar[5]arene, and in another
case, the sensing was achieved by a supramolecular host–guest
complex of a water-soluble pillar[5]arene conjugate and a perylenediimide
derivative.30,31 Huang and co-workers reported
the selective sensing of Fe3+ with an anthracence-appended
copillar[5]arene in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution using different
spectral techniques.32 Wei and co-workers
demonstrated dual sensing of Fe3+ and F– in H2O/DMSO (1:9) by a copillar[5]arene and its iron
complex, respectively.33 Similarly, Zhang
and co-workers have shown the sequential fluorescence sensing of Fe3+ and F– in DMSO/H2O (8:2) using
an imine derivative of pillar[5]arene.34 Although there are several pillararene-based receptors to recognize
Fe3+ and F–,35−39 to the best of our knowledge, the receptors for amino
acids are limited to methionine, tryptophan, arginine, and lysine.40−45

Sequential sensing of cations and anions by pillar[5]arene conjugates
has been reported in the literature, while a single pillar[n]arene derivative capable of detecting multiple ions and
amino acids is rather rare.46 In addition
to this, it is important to note that the majority of biological and
environmental processes occur in an aqueous system. Hence, the host
system used for the detection of ions and molecules should be water
soluble. Other challenges remaining in developing a selective sensor
molecule are the interference by other guest ions and the high hydration
enthalpy of guest species in water, which, in turn, reduces the binding
between the host and guest species. We have successfully overcome
all of these challenges, and herein, we report the synthesis of a
novel triazole-linked amino derivative of pillar[5]arene, APA, and its selective sensing of Fe3+ among 11 biologically
relevant ions in aqueous solution. Further, we have used an in situ
prepared Fe3+ complex of APA for the selective
sensing of F– among 11 halides and cysteine among
the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.

Results and Discussion
A pillar[5]arene bearing 10 primary amine groups through a triazole
and amide linkage has been synthesized by a four-step reaction procedure
(Scheme 1). In the
first step, hydroquinone, a commercially available starting material,
was treated with propargyl bromide and potassium carbonate in acetone
under refluxing conditions, leading to the formation of a disubstituted
derivative of hydroquinone, 1a. The cyclized pillar[5]arene
derivative, 1b, was obtained by reacting 1a with paraformaldehyde and BF3·OEt2 in
dichloromethane. A 1,3-diploar cycloaddition reaction was carried
out using 1b and ethyl azidoacetate in the presence of
CuSO4·5H2O and ascorbic acid in dimethylformamide
(DMF) to afford a decaester derivative of pillar[5]arene, 1c. Finally, the fluorescent probe, APA, was synthesized
by the reaction of 1c with an excess amount of ethylene
diamine at 80 °C. The structure of the decaamine derivative, APA, and its precursors was confirmed by 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and elemental analysis
(Figure S1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Decaamine Derivative of Pillar[5]arene, APA
APA is decorated with three different functional groups,
such as amide, triazole, and primary amine, on each of its arms. Hence,
the decaamine-functionalized APA provides a flexible
binding core during its interaction with various ions and molecules.
The ion and amino acid detection of APA was carried out
by fluorescence and UV–visible spectroscopy in water. We excited APA at 290 nm and studied its fluorescence emission from 300
to 420 nm. The sensor molecule, APA, exhibited fluorescence
quenching upon interaction with Fe3+, while no change in
the fluorescence intensity was observed upon titration with other
ions, viz., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ (Figure 1). APA showed
fluorescence quenching of ∼265-fold during the titration with
Fe3+, indicating the selectivity of APA toward
Fe3+ over other studied metal ions. The detection limit
of the sensor, APA, for Fe3+ was 689 ppm.

of APA with increasing concentrations of Fe3+, (b) plot of relative fluorescence intensity (I/I0) of APA versus mole
ratios of Fe3+, and (c) histogram representing the fluorescence
quenching (I0/I) obtained
during the titration of APA with 11 metal ions.

UV–visible spectral titrations were also carried out to
support the binding of Fe3+ with APA. During
the titration, the concentration of APA was kept constant
at 10 μM and the concentration of Fe3+ was increased
gradually from 2 to 100 equiv. When APA was titrated
against Fe3+, a marginal increase was observed in the absorbance
band at 290 nm, indicating the complex formation of APA with Fe3+. Plots of absorbance versus wavelength and
absorbance versus mole ratio, [Fe3+]/[APA],
are given in Figure 2.

Figure 2 (a) Absorption spectra obtained for the titration of APA by Fe3+, and (b) plot of absorbance versus mole ratio,
[Fe3+]/[APA].

The interaction between APA and Fe3+ was
studied by 1H NMR titrations in D2O/CD3OD (9.2:0.8). During the titration, the concentration of APA was kept constant and the concentration of Fe3+ was varied
to afford mole ratios, [Fe3+]/[APA], of 0.5,
1.5, and 3.0 (Figure 3). The 1H NMR signals of aliphatic protons (protons 7
and 8) exhibited a marginal downfield shift during the titration with
Fe3+, implying the interaction of Fe3+ with
the terminal groups of APA. A minimal or no change in
chemical shift was observed for the other protons of APA during the titration with Fe3+. A similar kind of chemical
shift was reported in the literature for the interaction of pillar[n]arene conjugates with metal ions during complexation.47 Hence, in addition to the fluorescence and UV–visible
titrations, 1H NMR studies further supported the interaction
of Fe3+ with APA.

1.5, and (d) 3.0. The asterisk denotes the solvents.

Further, we explored the secondary sensing properties of an in
situ prepared Fe3+ complex of APA (FeAPA) with anions and amino acids. The initial fluorescence intensity
of APA was quenched by the addition of 50 equiv of Fe3+. During the titration of FeAPA with anions,
the fluorescence intensity of FeAPA was increased by
a gradual addition of F–, and it showed a fluorescence
enhancement of ∼12-fold (Figures 4 and S2). None
of the other anions, viz., Cl–, Br–, I–, CO32–, HCO3–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, OAc–, NO3–, and SO4–, produced any change in the fluorescence intensity of FeAPA even after the addition of 200 equiv of anions. The titration results
clearly indicated the selectivity of FeAPA to F– over other studied ions. The fluorescence enhancement observed during
the titration of FeAPA with F– was
caused by the displacement of Fe3+ from the FeAPA complex, leaving free APA in the titration solution.
Hence, upon complete removal of Fe3+ by F–, the initial fluorescence intensity of APA was restored,
as indicated by the fluorescence enhancement (Figure 4). The minimum concentration of F– that can be detected by FeAPA in water was found to
be 434 ppm. The secondary sensing ability of FeAPA with
F– was further confirmed by absorption spectral
titrations. During the titration, the absorbance of the in situ prepared FeAPA was monitored by increasing the concentration of F–. It was found that the initial absorbance of the FeAPA complex was decreased by the addition of F–, and finally, the absorption spectrum showed characteristics similar
to that of free APA (Figure S3). These results support the displacement of Fe3+ from
the FeAPA complex and the formation of free APA with higher equivalents of F– in the solution.

Figure 4 (a) Plot of relative fluorescence intensity (I/I0) of FeAPA versus mole
ratio ([F–]/[FeAPA]) of added F– in water, and (b) histogram representing the fluorescence
response of FeAPA after the addition of 200 equiv of
F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, CO32–, HCO3–, HSO4–, H2PO4–, OAc–, NO3–, and SO4– in water.

In addition to the selective sensing of FeAPA toward
F–, we further explored the secondary sensing ability
of FeAPA upon interaction with the 20 naturally occurring
amino acids. The in situ prepared complex, FeAPA, was
prepared by mixing APA and Fe3+ in a ratio
of 1:100 in water. During the titration of FeAPA with
amino acids, the fluorescence intensity of FeAPA increased
exponentially with the addition of cysteine and the maximum intensity
was obtained at 80 equiv of cysteine (Figures 5 and S4) with
a fluorescence enhancement of ∼112-fold. The regeneration of
the fluorescence intensity of FeAPA during the titration
with cysteine is attributed to the displacement of Fe3+ from the binding core of FeAPA and the formation of
free APA. We also tested the interaction of all remaining
19 amino acids with FeAPA and found that none of the
amino acids brought about any significant change in the fluorescence
intensity of FeAPA. Hence, our result demonstrates the
efficacy of FeAPA in detecting cysteine over other naturally
occurring amino acids by fluorescence enhancement. The detection limit
of Cys by FeAPA was estimated to be 1740 ppm. The displacement
mechanism during the detection of Cys was further established by absorption
spectral titration of FeAPA with Cys. The initial absorbance
of the in situ prepared FeAPA complex was gradually decreased
upon the addition of Cys. Finally, the absorbance of the complex was
found to be almost the same as that of free APA. This
result suggests the disruption of the FeAPA complex followed
by the removal of Fe3+ by Cys, leaving free APA in the solution (Figure S5).

ratio of ([Cys]/[FeAPA]) of added Cys in water, and (b)
histogram representing the fluorescence of FeAPA after
the addition of 200 equiv of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids.

In summary, a novel functionalized pillar[5]arene, APA, was synthesized and its ion and amino acid sensing capability was
demonstrated using fluorescence, absorption, and 1H NMR
spectroscopy. Water-soluble APA could act as a sensor
for Fe3+ among 11 biologically relevant ions with a minimum
detection limit of 689 ppm. The in situ prepared ensemble, FeAPA, could act as a turn-on sensor for fluoride among the 11 anions
studied by fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The sensitive
and selective sensing of cysteine among the 20 naturally occurring
amino acids was achieved by FeAPA through fluorescence
enhancement (∼120-fold) in water. The minimum detection limits
of FeAPA for F– and Cys were 434 and
1740 ppm, respectively. Selective detection of F– and Cys was achieved by the displacement mechanism where Fe3+ was dechelated from the binding core of FeAPA, leaving APA alone.

General Procedure for Fluorescence Experiments
All
fluorescence titrations were carried out in HPLC grade water. The
bulk solution of APA (6 × 10–4 M) was prepared in water/DMSO, and the total concentration of DMSO
present in the final solution used for titration studies was 0.6%.
The salts of cations and anions, and the amino acids, were dissolved

of APA was kept at 20 μM and the concentration
of metal salts was increased gradually to get the required mole ratios
of APA/Mn+. The final concentration
of APA was kept at 10 μM for UV–visible
spectral titrations. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated using
the equation, LOD = 3σ/m.46
