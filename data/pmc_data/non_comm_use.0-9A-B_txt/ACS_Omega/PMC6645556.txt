Because of the existence of anisotropic surface energy with respect to the
hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice structure, magnesium alloy dendrite
prefers to grow along certain crystallographic directions and exhibits
a complex growth pattern. To disclose the underlying mechanism behind
the three-dimensional (3-D) growth pattern of magnesium alloy dendrite,
an anisotropy function was developed in light of the spherical harmonics
and experimental findings. Relevant atomistic simulations based on
density functional theory were then performed to determine the anisotropic
surface energy along different crystallographic directions, and the
corresponding anisotropic strength was quantified via the least-square
regression. Results of phase field simulations showed that the proposed
anisotropy function could satisfactorily describe the 3-D growth pattern
of the α-Mg dendrite observed in the experiments. Our investigations
shed great insight into understanding the pattern formation of the
hcp magnesium alloy dendrite at an atomic level.

Introduction
Magnesium alloys are
extensively applied in the industry because
of their light weight, high specific strength, and environmental friendliness.1,2 The α phase or α-Mg dendrite is one of the most important
microstructures;3,4 the dendritic size, orientation,
and morphological distributions significantly influence the mechanical
properties of the magnesium alloys.5−7 Therefore, understanding
the dendritic growth pattern, in particular determination of the preferred
growth orientation-related three-dimensional (3-D) morphology, is
of crucial importance in controlling the solidification microstructure
and the associated properties of the alloys. The α-Mg dendrite
with an hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattice structure usually prefers
to grow along the highly symmetrical directions,8−10 resulting in
a 6-fold symmetry on the basal plane. In this respect, recent experimental
investigations have confirmed that the α-Mg dendrite exhibits
an 18-primary-branch pattern in 3-D, with 6 along the ⟨112̅0⟩
directions on the basal plane and the other 12 along the ⟨112̅x⟩ directions on the nonbasal planes, such as ⟨112̅3⟩
and ⟨224̅5⟩ (i.e., ⟨112̅ 2.5⟩).11−13

During solidification, both thermodynamic and kinetic effects
at
the solid–liquid interface play crucial roles in determining
the microstructure pattern formation.14−20 For a dendritic microstructure, however, the growth orientation
and pattern formation are mostly determined by the thermodynamic factors
related to the anisotropic surface energy in light of the underlying
lattice structure.4,6,8,9 Meanwhile, the atomic stacking based on
the lattice configuration can also be interpreted and understood in
terms of the anisotropic surface energy21 and accordingly understanding the 3-D growth pattern formation of
the α-Mg dendrite requires a quantitative investigation of the
anisotropic surface energy at the atomic level. Relevant studies have
revealed that additional elements could also affect the anisotropic
surface energy and thus the dendritic growth pattern, leading to complex
dendritic microstructures that are not fully understood.22,23

It is well established that dendrite tends to grow along those
directions with the maximum surface energy or the minimum surface
stiffness.24−26 To quantify this, an explicit surface energy function
must be formulated as a prior. For the metallic alloy dendrite with
an face-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice structure, such formulation has
been well established and extensively employed.5,25 However,
this is not the case for the magnesium alloy dendrite with an hcp
lattice structure. One of the available models for the hcp α-Mg
dendrite was17,27 1  where γ0 is the average surface
energy and ε20, ε40, ε60, and ε66 measure the anisotropic strength
along different directions. Equation 1 could perfectly describe the 6-fold symmetry of the
α-Mg dendrite at the basal plane, but it could not characterize
the dendritic pattern at the nonbasal planes. Consequently, the simulated
dendritic growth pattern deviated significantly from that observed
in the experiment.12,22 Therefore, it is necessary to
develop an anisotropic function to describe the practical pattern
formation of the hcp magnesium alloy dendrite. According to the experimental
findings on the 3-D growth pattern of the α-Mg dendrite, in
this work, we first presented an anisotropy function by combining
certain terms of the spherical harmonics. Relevant atomistic simulations
based on the hcp lattice structure and density functional theory (DFT)28 were then performed for the first time to quantify
the associated anisotropic strength along different directions. The
influence of both solute type and solute concentration on the anisotropic
parameters was also investigated and discussed.

Results and Discussion
According to the experimental observations, the α-Mg dendrite
exhibits an 18-primary-branch pattern in 3-D.12,13 A typical way of characterizing such a growth pattern is by formulating
an anisotropic function on the basis of spherical harmonics17,29 2  where flm is the expansion coefficient, ylm(θ, φ) is the spherical harmonics function,
and θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π]
are the spherical coordinate angles. We employed the y20-square and y53-square terms
to describe the 18-primary-branch pattern of the α-Mg dendrite 3   4   5  where α20 and α53 are the anisotropic
parameters and 6  where nx, ny, and nz are the
components of surface
normal unit vector n⃗ along the x, y, and z directions, respectively,
as shown in Figure 1a. It is worth stressing that the y53-square term could satisfactorily illustrate the 18-primary-branch
pattern (including both basal and nonbasal directions) of the magnesium
alloy dendrite observed in the experiments.12 Accordingly, eqs 4 and 5 can be written as 7   8  On substituting eqs 7 and 8 into eq 3, the resultant surface
energy formulation is expressed as 9  where εi’s (i = 1, 2, and 3) are the anisotropic
parameters weighing the anisotropic strength along different directions.
In particular, ε1 relates to dendritic growth along
the direction normal to the basal plane (i.e., ⟨0001⟩),
whereas ε2 and ε3 relate to that
along both the basal plane and nonbasal plane directions (i.e., ⟨112̅x⟩ and ⟨112̅0⟩).

of the spherical and Cartesian coordination
systems (a) and the atomic lattice structure of hcp magnesium (b),
showing the correlation between the indexes of crystallographic planes
and the corresponding orientations.

The magnitudes of ε1, ε2, ε3, and γ0 in eq 9 were quantitatively determined
via the DFT-based atomistic
simulations by constructing a slab model with a periodic boundary
condition. The surface unit cell repeats along the crystallographic
orientation normal to crystallographic plane {hkil}.28,30 For the hcp lattice structure,31,32 the indexes of the crystallographic plane and the perpendicular
orientation (e.g., ⟨112̅k⟩ ⊥
⟨112̅x⟩) are correlated via k = 2x(c/a)2/3 (see Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 2a, this model includes a vacuum region and a slab with several
atomic layers; the bottom atomic layers in the slab were fixed, whereas
the top ones were relaxed during optimization. Accordingly, the surface
energy along 12 crystallographic directions related to the preferred
growth orientations of the magnesium alloy dendrite, including {0001},
{101̅0}, {101̅1}, and {112̅k} with k ranging from 0 to 8 (see Supporting Table SI), was first determined. These values were then used
to calculate the magnitude of ε1, ε2, ε3, and γ0 on the basis of the
least-square regression method.8,33 The atomic structure
of binary Mg-based alloys was simulated using the solid solution model,
where a certain number of solvent atoms was replaced by the solute
atoms.34,35 It has been confirmed that the position
of additional atoms does not affect significantly the variation trend
of the calculated surface energy with respect to the surface orientations.36,37 The concentration of the additional elements for the magnesium alloys
was chosen on the basis of their solubility in the solid or the maximum
solute concentration in the Mg matrix.36 We optimized the atomic structure of bulk materials and then constructed
the surface slab model with respect to the growth orientations of
the α-Mg dendrite. In terms of an n-layer surface
slab model with respect to the {hkil} plane, the
surface energy can be obtained via30,33 10  where Eslabn is the total
energy per primitive slab unit cell, Ebulk is the total energy per primitive bulk unit cell, S is the surface area per primitive slab unit cell, and the factor
of 2 accounts for two equivalent surfaces of a particular slab model.
Details on the construction of the atomic structure model and surface
energy calculations for these magnesium alloys can be found elsewhere.37 Accordingly, the surface anisotropic parameters
were deduced from these calculated data of orientation-dependent surface
energy.

of the Mg–1.56 atom % Al alloy. (Note that the red spheres
and the blue spheres denote the aluminum atoms and the magnesium atoms,
respectively.)

The atomistic simulations
in this work were performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package within the DFT framework.28,38 The exchange and correlation interaction was described by local
density approximation with projector-augmented wave potentials.39 After convergence tests, a plane-wave cutoff
energy of 450 eV was used for pure Mg and 420 eV for binary Mg-based
alloys, including Mg–Al, Mg–Ba, Mg–Sn, Mg–Ca,
Mg–Y, and Mg–Zn. The k-point separation
in the Brillouin zone of the reciprocal space was set as 0.01 Å–1 for each surface unit cell.40 Meanwhile, the total energy was converged to 5 × 10–7 eV/atom with respect to electronic, ionic, and unit cell degrees
of freedom. The anisotropic surface energy was obtained from accurate
calculations in accordance with our representative slab models. Figure 2b,c shows the typical
atomic structures corresponding to the ⟨101̅0⟩
and ⟨112̅0⟩ surface orientations of Mg–1.56
atom % Al alloy, respectively. The calculated surface energy along
different orientations is listed in Supporting Table SI. The estimated surface energy of the {0001} basal
plane, that is, the most close-packed crystallographic plane, was
minimum, which agreed well with the previous reported results.17,27 It is worth mentioning that the method for the anisotropic surface
energy calculation of hcp Mg-based alloys could be employed for other
alloy systems as well. However, a specific slab model must be developed
to accommodate the influence of the lattice structure for other alloys,
for example, the fcc lattice structure for Ni-based alloys.

Depending on the DFT-based calculations and the least-square regression
according to eq 9, the
γ0, ε1, ε2, and
ε3 were evaluated and the corresponding values are
listed in Table 1,
together with those from the literature. The results indicated that
for all considered alloys, ε1 was always negative,
indicating that the α-Mg dendrite preferred not to grow along
⟨0001⟩, which agreed well with the experimental observations.11,12,23 On the contrary, ε2 was positive, signifying that the α-Mg dendrite preferred
to grow along both ⟨112̅0⟩ and ⟨112̅x⟩. Moreover, the value of ε3 was
either negative or positive, indicating that the growth tendency of
the α-Mg dendrite along ⟨112̅0⟩ changed
according to local conditions. Figure 3a,b shows the scope and distribution of anisotropic
parameters ε1, ε2, and ε3 for binary Mg–Al and Mg–Zn alloys, respectively,
and the insert maps show the corresponding polar diagrams of anisotropic
surface energy. The orientation-dependent surface energy of the other
Mg-based alloys, including Mg–Ba, Mg–Sn, Mg–Ca,
and Mg–Y, exhibited similar behavior as that of the Mg–Al
and Mg–Zn alloys, as shown in Supporting Figure S1. The average value of γ(θ, φ)
for these Mg-based alloys was ∼0.8 J/m2 and changed as the additional solute elements.

For all considered Mg–Al
alloys, ε1 varied
from −0.0467 to −0.0629, ε2 from 0.0736
to 0.1344, and ε3 from −0.1688 to 0.0594,
as shown in Figure 3a. This result signified that the Mg–Al alloy dendrite tended
to grow along ⟨112̅0⟩ in the basal plane and along
⟨112̅x⟩ in the nonbasal planes
and the growth tendency along the ⟨112̅x⟩ direction was dependent on the magnitude of Al concentration.
For different Mg–Zn alloys, ε1 changed from
−0.0331 to −0.033, ε2 from 0.0715 to
0.0765, and ε3 from −0.5014 to −0.4284,
as shown in Figure 3b. In comparison to that for the Mg–Al alloy dendrite, the
value of ε3 for the Mg–Zn alloy dendrite tended
to be more negative, indicating a weaker growth tendency along ⟨112̅0⟩
in the basal plane. The growth tendency along ⟨112̅x⟩ in the nonbasal planes of the Mg–Zn alloy
dendrite was comparable to that of the Mg–Al alloy dendrite.
The underlying reason behind such difference can be understood by
comparing the atomic interaction between the solvent and solute, as
indicated by the enthalpy of mixing, (ΔH).41 The predicted growth tendency of the α-Mg
dendrite according to eq 9 in terms of the anisotropic parameters was in agreement with previous
experimental findings.13,22

Figure 4a,b shows
typical graphic illustrations of the surface anisotropy function of
the Mg–1.56 atom % Al alloy and the Mg–2.0 atom % Zn
alloy dendrites, respectively. In Figure 4a, ε1 = −0.0547,
ε2 = 0.0805, ε3 = 0.0594, and γ0 = 0.8011 J/m2, and in Figure 4b, ε1 = −0.0317,
ε2 = 0.0757, ε3 = −0.4284,
and γ0 = 0.8094 J/m2, that is, according
to the DFT-based calculations and the least-square estimated values
shown in Figure 3a,b,
respectively. Then, the 3-D growth pattern of the hcp α-Mg dendrite
can be quantitatively determined with the evaluated anisotropic parameters.
However, the present surface anisotropy function is still limited
in terms of evaluating the angle between the ⟨112̅0⟩
and ⟨112̅x⟩ directions, that
is, it could never exceed 45°, which is different from some of
the values measured in the experiments.12,13 Further investigations
are thus required to resolve this uncertainty. Nevertheless, the proposed
anisotropy function is still able to capture the 18-primary-branch
pattern of the hcp α-Mg dendrite observed in the experiments,
which has not been achieved by other models.

for the surface anisotropy function of the
(a) Mg–1.56 atom % Al alloy dendrite and (b) Mg–2.0
atom % Zn alloy dendrite. The anisotropic parameters determined via
the DFT-based calculations and the least-square regression are (a)
ε1 = −0.0547, ε2 = 0.0805,
and ε3 = 0.0594 and (b) ε1 = −0.0317,
ε2 = 0.0757, and ε3 = −0.4284,
respectively.

The DFT-based atomistic
simulations in the present work were performed
under equilibrium conditions, which is different from the practical
experimental cases. During solidification, the way the atoms are absorbed
from the liquid phase to the solid phase is highly dependent on the
lattice structure of the formed crystal, and the atoms tend to attach
these locations with either the minimum surface stiffness or the maximum
surface energy,42−45 both being more concerned with the lattice structure rather than
the kinetic behavior at the liquid–solid interface. Accordingly,
we believed that the crystallographic lattice structure is the most
fundamental factor that determines dendritic pattern formation. Remarkably,
even with such difference, the predicted results on the growth pattern
of the magnesium alloy dendrite agreed quite well with the experimental
findings.36,37 However, more investigation, in particular
relevant atomistic simulations at elevated temperatures, should be
performed to explore the exact influence of temperature on the dendritic
growth pattern.

On the basis of the quantified anisotropic parameters,
the growth
pattern of the α-Mg dendrite was simulated by incorporating eq 9 into the phase field model. Figure 5 shows the simulated
morphology of a Mg–Sn alloy dendrite and a comparison with
those reported in ref (12) where the anisotropic parameters were guessed values. The results
confirmed that the proposed anisotropy function could reasonably describe
the 3-D growth pattern of the α-Mg dendrite. It is noted that
these guessed anisotropic parameters in ref (12) were significantly larger
than the ones determined on the basis of DFT calculations, and such
difference could generate artificial effects on the predictions of
the 3-D dendritic morphology. Besides the anisotropy function, meaningful
simulations of the hcp α-Mg dendrite also require a thorough
investigation of other important parameters, including partition coefficient,
supercooling, release of heat of fusion, and so on. Relevant studies
along these directions are still in progress, and the detailed results
will be reported in a forthcoming paper.

Conclusions
In summary, an anisotropy function based on
the spherical harmonics
and experimental findings was proposed to describe the 3-D growth
pattern of the hcp magnesium alloy dendrite. Relevant atomistic simulations
in light of density functional theory and the hcp lattice structure
were performed to quantify the surface energy along different growth
directions. Accordingly, the anisotropic parameters in the surface
energy formulation and the average values of surface energy (∼0.8
J/m2) for different Mg-based alloys were predicted via
the least-square regression method. The results showed that the proposed
surface anisotropy function in terms of the anisotropic parameters
could satisfactorily describe the practical 3-D morphology of the
magnesium alloy dendrite observed in the experiments. The present
work offers an important insight for a better understanding on the
3-D growth pattern of the hcp magnesium alloy dendrite and thus provides
a theoretical guidance for further exploring the microstructure formation
of those metallic alloy dendrites with a hexagonal symmetrical structure.
