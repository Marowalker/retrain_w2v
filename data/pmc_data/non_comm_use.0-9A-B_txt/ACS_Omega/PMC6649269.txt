The
present investigation elucidates a simple hydrothermal method
for preparing nanostructured bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) and carbon quantum dot (CQD) composite using spoiled (denatured)
milk-derived CQDs. The formation of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite was confirmed by UV–vis absorption, steady-state
emission, and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy studies. The
crystal structure and chemical composition of the composite were examined
by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The surface morphology
and the particle size distribution of the CQD–Bi2O3 were examined using field emission scanning electron
microscope and high-resolution transmission electron microscope observations.
As an anode material in lithium-ion battery, the CQD–Bi2O3 composite exhibited good electrochemical activity
and delivered a discharge capacity as high as 1500 mA h g–1 at 0.2C rate. The supercapacitor properties of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite electrode revealed good reversibility
and a high specific capacity of 343 C g–1 at 0.5
A g–1 in 3 M KOH. The asymmetric device constructed
using the CQD–Bi2O3 and reduced graphene
oxide delivered a maximum energy density of 88 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 2799 W kg–1, while the power
density reached a highest value of 8400 W kg–1 at
the energy density of 32 Wh kg–1. The practical
viability of the fabricated device is demonstrated by glowing light-emitting
diodes. It is inferred that the presence of conductive carbon network
has significantly increased the conductivity of the oxide matrix,
thereby reducing the interfacial resistance that resulted in excellent
electrochemical performances.

Introduction
In recent years, spike
in the industrial activities and the quest
for a sophisticated lifestyle have resulted in a huge demand for energy.
Currently, most of the energy demands are met by combustion of nonrenewable
fossil fuels that has resulted in the emission of toxic greenhouse
gases into the environment.1,2 Owing to the shortage
of the fossil fuel reserves and the imminent threat of global warming,
the pursuit for developing new technologies for clean energy production
has become indispensable. The use of renewable resources such as solar
and wind power could mitigate several energy and environmental issues.
As a result, reliance on renewable resources is on the rise, and subsequently,
there is an increasing need to store this energy for longer duration.1−5 Electrochemical energy-storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors
(SCs) offer an attractive way to store energy obtained from renewable
resources for sufficient time, to achieve a sustainable and pollution-free
environment.1−5

Among the various battery technologies, lithium-ion battery
(LIB)
is considered as a viable energy-storage device to fulfill the current
energy needs of the consumer electronics.6 LIB possesses several unique features such as high energy density,
high voltage, and reasonably longer lifespan. A typical commercial
LIB consists of an anode material made of graphite (theoretical capacity:
372 mA h g–1) and lithium transition-metal oxide
(e.g., doped LiCoO2 or LiFePO4; theoretical
capacity: 170 mA h g–1) as cathode material. A nonaqueous
solution of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethylene
carbonate is used as electrolyte.7−10 Despite the appreciable performances of
the LIBs in low-power portable electronic gadgets, large improvement
in electrode materials has to be made to achieve higher energy density,
larger gravimetric/volumetric capacity, and better cycling performances.6−10 In addition, to meet the future needs of electric vehicles and grid-scale
energy storage, researchers have devoted arduous efforts to develop
alternative anode materials for the LIBs to replace the current low-capacity
graphitic anode that works solely on the basis of the intercalation
process.6,9 In particular, metal oxides and sulfides
have attracted significant attention due to their stable chemical
states and high theoretical capacity in the range of 600–1000
mA h g–1, which is significantly higher than that
of the conventional graphite anode material.6−10

Recently, bismuth oxide (Bi2O3), owing to
its high theoretical capacity of 690 mA h g–1, has
been proposed as a potential anode material for LIB.11 For instance, Fiordiponti et al. examined Li-storage features
of Bi2O3 and reported a capacity of 660 mA h
g–1.12 Nearly two decades
later, Li et al. grew nanostructured Bi2O3 on
nickel foam using a polymer-assisted solution approach and demonstrated
its use as an anode material in LIBs with a capacity of 668 mA h g–1.13 Nevertheless, the cycling
stability was limited and required further improvements. To realize
higher capacity and long cycle life, various composites have been
proposed. For example, Li et al. demonstrated the preparation of macroporous
Bi2O3 using poly(methyl methacrylate) spheres
as colloidal crystal template and observed a reversible capacity of
500 mA h g–1 at 0.2C rate.14 Fang et al. synthesized the Bi2O3/graphene
composite and reported significant enhancement in capacity with cycling
stability.15 The same research group prepared
the polypyrrole-coated Bi2O3 to improve the
electron transport properties and used it in the LIB.16 Quite recently, Bi2O3/reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) nanocomposite has been generated via chemical bonding
as an anode material for LIB and shown to exhibit enhanced electrochemical
performance with appreciable capacity of 900 mA h g–1 at 0.1C rate.17 In another case, Liu
et al. designed Bi2O3–Bi2S3 heterostructure through partial sulfurization of Bi2O3 nanosheets and demonstrated a coulombic efficiency
of 83.7%.18

In contrast to LIBs,
supercapacitors can store charge by either
nonfaradic or fast faradic reactions at the electrode surface.1,4 It is well known that a typical supercapacitor releases energy rapidly
due to its ability to provide high power, long cycle life, and fast
charge–discharge processes. Subsequently, the performance of
the supercapacitor is highly dependent on the nature of the electrode
material in terms of its morphology, size, porosity, etc.1,4 Recently, nanostructured Bi2O3 has been also
examined as electrode material for supercapacitor application.1,4,19,20 For example, Li et al. prepared a freestanding nanocomposite of
Bi2O3–carbon nanofiber electrode by electrospinning
and reported a capacitance of 50 F g–1 for the asymmetric
supercapacitor with an energy density of 25 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 786 W kg–1.21 Shinde et al. showed that the Bi2O3–Ni-foam-based asymmetric supercapacitor device achieved a
high capacitance of 557 F g–1 with an energy density
of 80 Wh kg–1.22 Gujar
et al. electrochemically deposited Bi2O3 thin-film
electrode for supercapacitor to exhibit high electrochemical reversibility.23 Tong’s group reported the preparation
of Bi2O3 nanobelts, which exhibited a specific
capacitance of 250 F g–1.24

We have currently reported that the metal-oxide-embedded carbon
matrix could facilitate charge and ion transports, leading to improved
electrochemical performance for lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor
applications.25 Recently, carbon quantum
dots (CQDs) and graphene quantum dots have found their uses in several
energy-storage applications, namely, supercapacitors and Li- and Na-ion
batteries.26,27 In our recent work, we have established
that the CQDs present in the MnO2 nanocomposite improved
the accessibility of the charged ions and facilitated efficient charge
transport during the charge–discharge processes.28 To the best of our knowledge, there have been
no reports on the CQD-embedded nanostructured Bi2O3 for energy-storage applications. Thus, in the present study,
we have endeavored CQD-mediated synthesis of nanostructured Bi2O3 by a simple hydrothermal method and evaluated
its electrochemical performances in LIBs and supercapacitors.

Results
and Discussion
Spectral Characterizations of CQD–Bi2O3
Figure 1a shows the absorption profile of the aqueous dispersion
of
CQD–Bi2O3 recorded in the wavelength
range of 200–800 nm. It is obvious from Figure 1a that the UV–vis absorption spectral
response of CQD–Bi2O3 exhibits a broad
band in the range of 350–450 nm, which is attributed to the
intrinsic band gap absorption of the Bi2O3.
It has been reported that the band structure of the Bi2O3 is composed of Bi6p atomic orbitals, which are separated
into occupied and unoccupied parts.29,30 The former
hybridizes with the O2p band and contributes to the valence band,
while the latter is the main component for the conduction band, thereby
leading to the formation of narrow band gap in Bi2O3.29,30 Interestingly, the distinctive yellow color
of the as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 complements
the observed broad absorption band. The strong band centered at 290
nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of the
graphitic structure of the CQDs.28 This
clearly indicates that the CQD has been embedded inside the grains
of Bi2O3. Liu et al. reported a similar optical
absorption behavior in the case of Bi2O3–rGO
composite, in which the band in the range of 300–400 nm is
attributed to Bi2O3 and a weak band at 268 nm
is ascribed to the excitation of π-plasmon of the graphitic
structure.31 To substantiate the formation
of composite, the emission spectral profiles of the CQD and the CQD–Bi2O3 composite were recorded and the resulting spectra
are displayed in Figure 1b. It is seen that the CQD dispersion exhibits an emission maximum
at 425 nm upon excitation at 360 nm. Undoubtedly, in the case of the
yellow-colored CQD–Bi2O3 dispersion,
the emission intensity is quenched drastically with a very weak fluorescence.
The formation of weakly fluorescent CQD is attributed to the adsorption
of the CQD onto the surface of the formed Bi2O3 grains. Such quenching behavior has been reported for the CQD-metal
oxide composites.27,28

and (c) time-resolved
fluorescence profiles recorded for the pristine CQD and the CQD–Bi2O3 composite. Inset: Enlarged view of the emission
profile of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite.

Time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
analysis was carried out
to delineate the exact quenching mechanism in the CQD–Bi2O3 composite. Figure 1c shows the decay profiles of CQD and the
CQD–Bi2O3 composite. It is apparent from
the figure that the decay profiles are best fitted to a triexponential
decay curve with average lifetimes of 8.96 and 8.26 ns, respectively.
The negligible difference in the fluorescence lifetimes of the CQD
and the CQD–Bi2O3 composite clearly suggests
the formation of nonfluorescent ground-state complex and involvement
of static quenching mechanism.32 It is
well known that the formation of a ground-state complex between the
fluorophore and metal oxide materials cannot induce changes in the
fluorescence lifetimes of the fluorophore.33 Thus, it is believed that the observed emission quenching in the
case of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite is primarily
due to the static quenching mechanism. Moreover, this inference is
consistent with the steady-state emission studies. From the absorption,
emission, and time-resolved spectral analyses, it can be inferred
that the hydrothermal treatment of the bismuth nitrate in aqueous
CQD dispersion resulted in the formation of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite.

Crystal Structure and Morphology
The crystal structure
of the as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 composite
was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and the resultant
XRD pattern is displayed in Figure 2a. It is obvious that the XRD pattern of the sample
consists of well-defined characteristic diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 and carbon. The peaks located at 11.21, 14.12,
and 23.31° pertaining to CQD could be indexed to the standard
card of carbon (PDF # 46-0870).34 The set
of other Bragg peaks at 28.81, 31.23, 33.52, 47.08, and 54.93°
are indexed to the (201), (002), (220), (222), and (203) Bragg planes
of Bi2O3, respectively. The obtained Bragg peaks
are in good agreement with the JCPDS PDF # 65-1209.35 In addition, sharp Bragg peaks with narrow full width at
half-maximum imply large grain size and high crystallinity of the
sample. During the formation of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite, the ultrafine CQD seems to be agglomerated into
the larger grains. It has been reported earlier that the Bragg peaks
of the Bi2O3 obtained using PMMA template synthesis
were broad owing to the ultrafine grain size of the material.14 In a recent report, Deng et al. reported the
nearly amorphous nature of the Bi2O3/rGO nanocomposite.17 Undoubtedly, in the present instance, the presence
of sharp Bragg peaks for Bi2O3 clearly indicates
its highly crystalline nature.

Figure 2 (a) XRD, (b) Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR), and (c) Raman
spectral profiles of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite.

The chemical composition and the
surface functional groups of the
as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 were investigated
by FT-IR and Raman spectral analyses. The FT-IR profile of the CQD–Bi2O3 displayed in Figure 2b exhibits a band at 3386 cm–1, which is attributed to O–H and N–H stretching vibrations.
The sharp bands centered at 1612 and 1375 cm–1 are
ascribed to C–O stretching and C–H bending vibrations,
respectively. All of these peaks are indicative of the presence of
the CQD in the Bi2O3 sample.28 The peaks located at 464 and 510 cm–1 are characteristic of Bi–O vibrations, which is in agreement
with the previous reports.35 As shown in Figure 2c, the Raman spectrum
of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite exhibits a
broad band at 443 cm–1, which arises due to the
Bi–O Raman stretching frequency.36 The observed peak broadening in the Raman spectrum of the Bi2O3 in the lower-frequency region is attributed
to the atomic disorder resulting from the random orientation of the
lone-pair orbitals of Bi atoms.36

To quantify the amount of carbon present in the CQD–Bi2O3 composite, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was
performed in the temperature range of 30–700 °C under
N2 atmosphere. The TG profile shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information) exhibits a decrease in
the weight at 100 °C owing to the dehydration of the water molecules
that are trapped within the grains. In the temperature range of 250–450
°C, an appreciable weight loss of about 25% was observed, which
could be attributed to the complete decomposition of the CQD present
in the CQD–Bi2O3 nanostructure. It is
noted that the weight loss remained constant beyond 600 °C, implying
clearly that the nanocomposite is composed of 25% carbon. The TG profile
of the pristine CQD was also recorded, and the obtained profile is
shown in Figure S2. It is seen that the
CQD has a large weight loss as high as 85% due to decomposition of
carbon, confirming that the CQD is predominantly composed of carbon
moieties.

The formation of CQD–Bi2O3 involves
several steps.28,37 In the initial step, under hydrothermal
condition, the reaction between nitrate ion (NO3–) and water produces NH3 and hydroxyl ion (OH–) (eq 1). In the subsequent
steps, the hydration of NH3 leads to generation of ammonium
ion (NH4+) and OH– (eq 2). The formation of abundant
OH– increases the pH of the solution to yield unstable
bismuth hydroxide (Bi(OH)3) (eq 3). The unstable (Bi(OH)3) undergoes
decomposition to form stable Bi2O3 (eq 4). Prior to the formation
of (Bi(OH)3), the addition of Bi3+ precursor
to CQD solution resulted in the formation of CQD–Bi3+ intermediates, owing to the electrostatic interaction between the
positively charged Bi3+ and negatively charged CQD. The
negatively charged CQD seems to be displaced by OH– to form Bi(OH)3. We have recently reported a similar
strategy to prepare nanostructured MnO2 and NiO, as reported
elsewhere.28,37 The reactions leading to the
formation of CQD–Bi2O3 are shown below 1   2   3   4  Figure 3a shows the
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite acquired
at different magnifications. It is obvious that the morphology of
the prepared material is characterized by uniform spherical particles
of Bi2O3 grains with sparsely intertwined CQDs.
The morphology of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite
has the pore size in the range of 50–100 nm. Energy dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis was carried out to establish the elements present
in the sample, and the resultant EDX profile is depicted in Figure 3b. It is obvious
that the peaks pertaining to bismuth, oxygen, and carbon are present.
From the peak intensities of the EDX profile, the computed amounts
of Bi, O, and C are 51.67, 30.25, and 18%, respectively. The determined
amount of C in the sample almost agrees with the findings derived
from TG analysis albeit with a slight difference. It is pertinent
to note that the FE-SEM observations were performed by coating the
sample onto a noncarbon substrate to get the exact amount of the carbon
content in the material. The data obtained from the EDX analysis were
further corroborated by elemental mappings as shown in Figure 3c−f. The elemental mappings
clearly indicate the presence of all of the three elements (Bi, O,
and C) with uniform distribution. Notably, the intensities of Bi and
O are higher, implying that the prepared sample is primarily composed
of Bi2O3.

(inset), (b) EDX profile,
and (c–f) elemental mappings performed on the surface of the
CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) images
and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite are shown in Figure 4. It is apparent that nanosized
quasi-spherical Bi2O3 grains are enclosed within
the carbon matrix with a clearly visible boundary separating both
the Bi2O3 grains and the carbon (Figure 4a,b). The lattice fringe patterns
of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite sample
are shown in Figure 4c. The presence of two-dimensional lattice fringes indicates the
crystalline nature of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite.
As evidenced from Figure 4c, the calculated d-spacing values from the
lattice fringes 0.30, 0.26, and 0.16 nm are consistent with the (201),
(220), and (222) planes of the Bi2O3, respectively
[JCPDS PDF # 65-1209].34 However, the d-spacing values of 0.78 and 0.38 nm conform to the (100)
and (002) planes of the carbon [JCPDS PDF # 75-1621], respectively.35 As shown in Figure 4d, the SAED pattern is characterized by well-defined
spots and rings. The presence of well-defined spots and rings in the
SAED pattern further substantiates the crystalline nature of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite. The computed d-spacing values from the SAED pattern are in good agreement with
the d-spacing values of the Bi2O3 [JCPDS PDF # 65-1209] and carbon [JCPDS PDF # 75-1621], and this
further complements the findings derived from the XRD analysis.

Performance of CQD–Bi2O3 as Anode
for LIB
The Li-ion storage properties of the CQD–Bi2O3 anode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies. Figure 5a shows the CV profiles obtained
for the CR2032-type coin cell comprising the CQD–Bi2O3 as the anode and pure Li as the counter and reference
electrodes in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V at a scan speed
of 0.1 mV s–1. It is apparent that in the first
cycle, three prominent cathodic peaks are observed at 0.58, 1.3, and
1.5 V. The sharp peak at 0.58 V could be ascribed to the alloying
reaction of Bi with Li to from Li3Bi composition and the
formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI).13−17,37−39 The cathodic peak at 1.3 V is attributed to the reduction of the
Bi2O3 and Li+ leading to the formation
of metallic Bi and Li2O, whereas the peak centered at 1.5
V could be assigned to the reduction of tetragonal Bi2O2.33.13−17,38−40 The anodic
part of the first cycle CV exhibits peaks at 1, 1.71, and 2.3 V. These
peaks are attributed to dealloying of LiBi and Li3Bi reactions
and the subsequent oxidation reaction of Bi with Li2O resulting
in the regeneration of Bi2O3.13−17,37−39 In the successive cycles, i.e., second and third cycles, it is pertinent
to note that an additional peak appears at 0.74 V. The appearance
of peaks in this region is associated with the simultaneous alloying
reactions of Bi with Li to yield LiBi and Li3Bi.13−17,38−40 It should be
noted that in the first cycle, the cathodic peaks pertaining to the
instantaneous alloying reactions are not observed owing to the formation
of SEI near 1.0 V. Notably, the anodic peak observed at 1.71 V during
the first cycle disappeared in the subsequent cycles, indicating that
only a partial conversion has taken place between Bi2O3 and Bi.13−17,38−40 The CV curves
showed an appreciable overlapping as we move from the second to the
third CV sweep, indicating an excellent reversibility of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanostructure toward alloying and dealloying.
The various reactions that are associated with the Li storage in the
CQD–Bi2O3 composite could be given as
follows13−17

coin cell containing the CQD–Bi2O3 anode.

Discharging 5   6   7   8  Charging 9   10  The observed CV characteristics
of the CQD–Bi2O3 nanostructure are in
good agreement with the previously reported works.13−17 Thus, it can be inferred that the as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 nanostructure is electrochemically active and
it has undergone simultaneous two-step alloying and conversion reactions
with Li+ during the electrochemical reactions.

The
charging and discharging performances of the CQD–Bi2O3 anode material were investigated in the potential
range of 0.01–3.0 V at different current rates for 50 cycles.
The representative charge–discharge profiles obtained on the
coin cell at the 0.2C rate are displayed in Figure 5b. The obtained charge–discharge profiles
are in good agreement with the above-discussed cyclic voltammetry
studies of the CQD–Bi2O3 material. It
can be noted that the initial discharge capacity of the CQD–Bi2O3 anode is about 2700 mA h g–1. Such higher discharge capacity has been usually reported for the
alternative anodes such as Si, Sn, Co3O4, etc.9,10 The higher discharge capacity could be ascribed to the formation
of different lithiated phases as well as the simultaneous occurrence
of conversion reaction and contribution from carbon (CQD).13 In the subsequent cycles, the discharge capacity
dropped to 1500 mA h g–1. Owing to the presence
of the conductive carbon network, the as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 anode material has retained a discharge capacity
of 1200 mA h g–1 after three cycles, which is much
higher than the previously reported values for the bare Bi2O3, Bi2O3/rGO, and 3DOM β-Bi2O3 anode materials.14,17 Clear plateaus
are observed during charging/discharging at potentials where redox
peaks appeared in the CV curves, authenticating the occurrence of
alloying/dealloying process. To examine the rate capability of the
CQD–Bi2O3 anode material, cycle life
data were acquired at different C rates, and the resultant data are
shown in Figure 5c.
The columbic efficiency was also noted at each C rate, and the calculated
values are shown in Figure 5. It is observed that the increase in current rates has resulted
in the decrease of discharge capacities. Such a decrease in discharge
capacity arises due to rapid charge–discharge process and inefficient
utilization of the active material. Remarkably, it can be seen from Figure 5c that the CQD–Bi2O3 anode exhibits discharge capacities of 2700,
935, 599, 394, and 298 mA h g–1 at 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
0.8, and 1C rates, respectively. Notably, at each C rate, a nearly
stable discharge capacity is retained. For instance, at 0.6C rate,
the discharge capacity is 599 mA h g–1 and this
capacity is nearly stable. The cycling stability recorded at 1C rate
is separately given in Figure S4. It is
seen that the CQD–Bi2O3 composite exhibits
a stabilized discharge capacity of 300 mA h g–1 for
the examined 30 cycles with nearly 100% columbic efficiency.

It is noted that the preparation of CQD-anchored Bi2O3 composite resulted in a highly intertwined carbon network.
The presence of carbon matrix around Bi2O3 grains
could ensure excellent structural stability and offset the undesirable
cracking of the electrode material by effectively accommodating the
volume change associated with alloying/dealloying. Further, the presence
of conductive carbon matrix could result in seamless electron/ion
transportations across the electrode/electrolyte and help in achieving
stable SEI.41−43 Thus, the carbon nanonetwork has a profound influence
on the overall electrochemical performance of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite.

To get further insight into
the charge-transfer kinetics, impedance
analysis was carried out on the as-assembled and cycled coin cells.
The corresponding Nyquist plots in the frequency range of 400 kHz
to 50 mHz are shown in Figure 5d. It is obvious that the impedance plot is characterized
by the presence of a semicircle in the high-frequency region corresponding
to electrode resistance and a straight line in the low-frequency range
representing the Warburg element arising due to the diffusion-controlled
charge-transfer process.9 It is apparent
from Figure 5d that
the diameter of the semicircle is almost invariant for the as-assembled
and cycled coin cells. Interestingly, the presence of a steep slope
in the low-frequency region indicates a rapid diffusion of Li+ ions into the anode material.9 Thus, from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it
can be inferred that the carbon matrix acted as a conductive network
as well as a good support during the volume expansion of the metal
oxide.

Supercapacitor Performances of CQD–Bi2O3
Initially, the supercapacitor characteristics of
the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode were analyzed
using CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies in a three-electrode
configuration. Figure 6 shows the CV profiles recorded at different scan rates of 10, 20,
30, 50, and 100 mV s–1 in 3 M KOH in the potential
range of 0–0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl. It is obvious from Figure 6a that all of the CV profiles
exhibit redox peaks, confirming the pseudocapacitance feature. The
anodic peaks located at −0.12 and −0.32 V are ascribed
to the oxidation of Bi to Bi2+ to form Bi2O2 metastable phase and oxidation of Bi2+ to Bi3+, while the prominent cathodic peak at −0.38 V is
due to the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi2+ and subsequent
formation of Bi (i.e., Bi2O3 ↔ intermediate
Bi2+ (Bi2O2) ↔ Bi).21−23,44 It can be noted that at a higher
scan speed, the CV profiles are characterized by increased current
response along with a notable shift in the anodic and cathodic peak
positions, which could be ascribed to structural changes or the IR
drop.21−23 The increase in the peak current with increase of
the scan rate signifies that the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode possesses excellent rate capabilities, which could result
in fast quasi-reversible faradic reactions.21−23,25,28 The electrochemical
reactions that are responsible for the appearance of redox peaks in
KOH are given below21−23 11   12   13  Galvanostatic charge–discharge
profiles
were recorded out to get further insights into the capacity characteristics
of the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode. Figure 6b shows the charge–discharge
profiles recorded in the potential range of −0.8 to 0 V at
different current densities, 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5, and 1.6 A g–1. It is pertinent to note that the obtained charge–discharge
curves are nonsymmetric. The voltage drop at the initial stage of
discharge is ascribed to the internal resistance of the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode. The plateau observed in the range
0.4–0.6 is ascribed to the faradic process owing to the CQD–Bi2O3.21−23 It is noted that the charge–discharge profiles
are disproportionate, especially at lower current density. This results
in a lower coulombic efficiency. Such lower coulombic efficiency at
low current density could be due to phase change of Bi2O3 in CQD–Bi2O3, as has been
reported previously by Shinde et al.22 In
the subsequent cycling, Bi2O3 seems to be stabilized.
It can be seen that at higher current density, the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite has high coulombic efficiency.

capacity on current density.

The specific capacity of the CQD–MnO2 electrode
was calculated from the charge–discharge profiles using the
following formula28 14  where C is the specific capacity
(C g–1), I is the discharge current
(A), Δt is the discharge time (s), and m is the active mass of the electrode (g). The dependence
of specific capacity on the applied current density is given in Figure 6c. It can be inferred
that with the increase of current density, the specific capacity showed
a considerable decrease. At high current density, the rapid charging–discharging
process would result in poor utilization of the active material, thereby
resulting in low capacity. Such trends are often observed for battery-type
materials.

The specific capacity of the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode estimated at 0.5 A g–1 was
as high as
343 C g–1. It is observed that the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode exhibits a specific capacity of about
61 C g–1 even at a higher current of 1.6 A g–1. The specific capacitance value in the range of 75–300
F g–1 has been reported for the Bi2O3-based electrodes, as shown in Table S1. Notably, the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode exhibits
better specific capacity compared to the reported values, indicating
that the CQD–Bi2O3 can be a potential
electrode for supercapacitor application.39,45 It is pertinent to note that the CQDs used in the preparation of
the CQD–Bi2O3 composite resulted in an
agglomerated intertwined carbon network across the Bi2O3 matrix, as has been confirmed by SEM and TEM. The absence
of isolated CQD grains in the HR-TEM images further supports that
the CQDs are composited with Bi2O3. In the composite,
the diffusion path between the Bi2O3 grains
are filled by the conductive CQD. Hence, the overall conductivity
of the composite is enhanced by reducing the interfacial as well as
grain boundary resistances that resulted in better electrochemical
performance. To substantiate this, conductivity measurement was done
for each of the CQD, Bi2O3, and CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite. The obtained conductivity profiles
of the samples are displayed in Figure S3. It is seen that the frequency-independent dc conductivity is the
lowest for the Bi2O3 and the highest for the
CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite. The CQD exhibits
higher conductivity than the Bi2O3. This observation
clearly confirms that the CQD–Bi2O3 nanocomposite
has resulted in much better electrochemical performance owing to the
high conductivity, surface area, and quick electron/ion transportations.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried
out on freshly prepared electrode as well as at the end of the 1000
charge–discharge cycles, and the obtained Nyquist plots are
given in Figure 7.
It is seen that both the plots comprise a depressed semicircle in
the high-frequency region and an extended spike (Warburg element)
in the low-frequency region. It is apparent that the Nyquist plot
of the cycled electrode showed a significant decrease in the diameter
of the semicircle and the Warburg element shifts to a lower resistance
value. Remarkably, the resistance of the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode cycled up to 1000 cycles increased significantly,
which may be due to degradation of the electrode material upon cycling.
The presence of Warburg element suggests the existence of diffusion-controlled
faradic reactions.25,28 Moreover, the inclination of
the Warburg element to 45° toward x-axis clearly
implies the dominance of the diffusion-controlled process.

Performance of Asymmetric Supercapacitor Device
To
evaluate the practical applicability of the prepared CQD–Bi2O3 composite, asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed
using the CQD–Bi2O3 as positive electrode
and the rGO as negative electrode in 3 M KOH. The electrochemical
behavior of the fabricated asymmetric device was evaluated in the
potential range of 0–1.4 V. The CV curves of the asymmetric
device at various scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 50, 100, and 200 mV s–1 are shown in Figure 8a. It is evident that the CV profiles of the asymmetric
device displayed a quasi-rectangular shape with redox peaks, and the
operating cell voltage can be as high as 1.4 V. Such an enhanced operating
voltage could significantly enhance the energy density of the device.
It is to be noted that at all scan rates, the CV curves displayed
both faradic (peak at 0.5 V) and nonfaradic contributions, confirming
the perfect asymmetric supercapacitor behavior. With the increase
of the scan rate, the anodic and cathodic currents showed a significant
increase, which is characteristic of an ideal supercapacitor. Besides
the obvious redox peaks in CV profiles, even at a higher scan rate
of 200 mV s–1, the electrode exhibits excellent
rate capability in the fabricated device. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
curves for the asymmetric device acquired at various current densities
in 3 M KOH are shown in Figure 8b. It can be seen in Figure 8b that the charge–discharge profiles exhibit
a clear plateau in the voltage range of 0.6–0.4 V, substantiating
the aforementioned CV data. The energy density and power density of
the device were calculated using the following equations25,28 15   16  where E is the energy density
(Wh kg–1), C is the specific capacitance
(F g–1), V is the potential window
(V), P is the power density (W kg–1), and t is the discharge time (s). Figure 8c shows the Ragone plot obtained
for the asymmetric device. It is seen that the fabricated asymmetric
device achieved a maximum energy density of 88 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 2799 W kg–1, while the power
density reached the highest value of 8400 W kg–1 at the energy density of 32 Wh kg–1. Such a high
power density has not been reported for the Bi2O3-based device. Table 1 shows the reported energy and power densities for the Bi2O3-based asymmetric device.21,22,46−49 So far, Bi2O3-based asymmetric
device exhibited energy density in the range of 13–130 Wh kg–1 with power density in the range of 700–1600
W kg–1. In the present work, it is evident that
the fabricated asymmetric device consisting of the CQD–Bi2O3 delivers passable energy density with the highest
power density. These results clearly imply that the fabricated asymmetric
device hold great potentials for application in practical energy-storage
systems. An ideal supercapacitor device must possess good long-term
cycling stability. Thus, the cycle life data of the fabricated asymmetric
device were tested over 2500 cycles at 3 A/g (shown in Figure 8d). The charge–discharge
profiles of the device obtained for the first and the last three cycles
are displayed in the inset of Figure 8d. The unperturbed charge–discharge profiles
during the cycle life imply excellent cycling stability. The average
coulombic efficiency was as high as 95%. Remarkably, the fabricated
device works at a high operating voltage window of 0–1.4 V,
which is highly required for practical devices. Finally, the practical
applicability of the CQD–Bi2O3 electrode
was tested by fabricating an asymmetric device in the form of a coin
cell with CQD–Bi2O3 as positive electrode
and the rGO as negative electrode in 3 M KOH using Whatman filter
paper as the separator. The fabricated device was charged to a potential
of up to 1.4 V and discharged to glow commercial light-emitting diode
(LED), as shown in Figure 9.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated a simple and facile route to generate
nanostructured CQD–Bi2O3 composite. The
morphology of the composite consisted of uniform spherical particles
of Bi2O3 with sparsely intertwined CQDs. The
electrochemical studies revealed that the CQD–Bi2O3 anode has undergone simultaneous conversion and alloying
reactions reversibly with Li. The fabricated coin cell composing of
the CQD–Bi2O3 composite as anode material
achieved a discharge capacity of 1500 mA h g–1 at
0.2C with reasonable durability. The three-electrode supercapacitor
studies revealed a battery-type pseudocapacitance behavior with a
specific capacity of 343 C g–1 at 0.5 A g–1. The fabricated asymmetric device constructed using the CQD–Bi2O3 and rGO electrodes delivered excellent energy
and power densities with a wide operating potential window of 0–1.4
V. The fabricated device retained almost 100% coulombic efficiency
even in the 2500th cycle. We believe that the present study using
CQD mediator offers new strategies for the development of a simple
and multifunctional nanostructured carbon network metal oxide-based
electrode material for energy-storage applications. Further, the present
synthesis strategy can be explored for preparing other metal oxide
systems to use them in energy storage, photocatalysis, electrochemical
water splitting, and other applications.

Experimental Section
Material
Synthesis
The detailed preparation and characterizations
of the CQDs have been reported in our recent works.28,50 Briefly, 25 mL of denatured waste milk was added to 20 mL of distilled
water in a beaker. The resulting solution was transferred to a 50
mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 2 h to yield
CQD dispersions. The dark brown CQD dispersion was subjected to centrifugation (10 000 rpm) and subsequently
freeze-dried
to obtain CQD powder.

For preparation of CQD–Bi2O3, 1 g of Bi(NO3)3 was added to
3 mL of HNO3 and 12 mL of distilled water and sonicated
to dissolve the nitrate. To this solution, 0.1 g of solid CQD was
added and the solution was made up to 25 mL by adding 12 mL of distilled
water with brief sonication until the solution turns dark brown. The
solution was then heated at 170 °C for 2 h in a Teflon-lined
autoclave to yield a transparent yellow solution. The solution was
further heated to dryness at 120 °C to yield solid yellow powder
and used for further characterizations.

Material Characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern of the as-prepared CQD–Bi2O3 composite
was examined in the 2θ range of 10–75° at a scan
speed of 1° per minute using a diffractometer (Bruker D8 PXRD)
equipped with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5184 Å) radiation source.
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) profiles were acquired using Nicolet
6700 by means of the KBr pellet method. Raman spectroscopy measurements
were done using Witec Confocal Raman instrument with a 750 nm Ar ion
laser. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the as-prepared
material were analyzed by a field emission scanning electron microscope
(FE-SEM Carl Zeiss SUPRA55VP) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDAX) spectrometer. The particle size and morphology of the as-prepared
CQD–Bi2O3 was examined using a high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (JEOL JEM 2100) at an operating voltage
of 200 kV. The absorption spectral analysis was carried out using
a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Varian Cary-5000). The steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence decay profiles were recorded using
a spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-FL3-11). The excitation
source was a 450 W xenon lamp, and the samples were excited at a wavelength
of 360 nm. For lifetime studies, pulsed nano-LED was used to excite
the sample at 295 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis of the CQD–Bi2O3 was carried out in the temperature range of
30–700 °C in N2 atmosphere at a 10 °C
min–1 scan rate by using a thermogravimetric analyzer
(TG-DTA-Q 600 SDT). For conductivity measurement, each powder sample
was made into 10 mm diameter pellets with thicknesses of 0.9 mm (CQD–Bi2O3), 3.5 mm (CQD), and 0.92 mm (Bi2O3). Then, the pellets were placed in between current collectors
and impedance data were measured by using an impedance analyzer (Material
Mates M2-7260). From the impedance data, the conductivity of the samples
was estimated by using the following equation51 17  where l is the thickness
of the sample, A is the cross-sectional area of the
pellet, and R is the resistance.

Fabrication
of LIB and Electrochemical Characterization
The electrochemical
measurements of the CQD–Bi2O3 composite
were evaluated by fabricating CR2032-type
coin cells that were assembled inside an Ar-filled glovebox (Nichwell
α-1500u). Briefly, the anode was prepared by mixing 70 wt %
active material (CQD–Bi2O3), 20 wt %
super P carbon, and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder
in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent to yield a homogeneous
slurry. The obtained slurry was then coated onto the Cu foil (9 μm
thickness) by means of the doctor blade technique and subsequently
vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 12 h. The active material-coated copper
foil was cut into disks of 16 mm diameter and used as electrode. The
mass of active material loaded onto the Cu foil was 2 mg. Pure Li
disk was used as the counter and reference electrodes. LiPF6 (1 M) in ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate
(2:1:2 volume ratio) was used as the electrolyte, and Celgard was
used as the separator. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) were recorded
on the fabricated coin cell in the potential range of 0.01–3.0
V at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 using Biologic SP-150
workstation. The electrochemical impedance measurements were carried
out on the coin cell in the frequency range of 400 kHz to 50 mHz by
using the same electrochemical workstation. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
cyclings were done on the coin cells at each of the 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
0.8, and 1C rates using NEWARE (CT-3008) battery testing system.

Supercapacitor Fabrication and Testing
For the supercapacitor
studies, the working electrode slurry was prepared by mixing CQD–Bi2O3, carbon black, and poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(PVDF) binder in the weight ratio of 70:20:10 using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. The obtained homogeneous
slurry was pasted onto the carbon cloth (CC) substrate (1 × 1
cm2) and dried overnight at 70 °C. Prior to the slurry
coating, the CC was treated with conc. HNO3 to make it
a hydrophilic surface. A three-electrode cell was constructed using
the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode (area: 1 ×
1 cm2), and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All of
the electrochemical studies were done in 3 M KOH. The cyclic voltammetry
studies were done in the potential range of −0.75 to 0.0 V
vs Ag/AgCl at different scan rates of 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 mV s–1. The galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles
were recorded at different current densities of 0.5, 0.8, 1, 1.5,
and 1.6 A g–1 in the same potential range. The electrochemical
impedance of the electrode was obtained in the frequency range of
0.01–100 kHz with an excitation potential of 20 mV. All of
the electrochemical characterizations were carried out using the same
electrochemical workstation at room temperature (24 °C). The
masses of the coated CC and the uncoated CC were measured using an
electronic balance. From the difference in masses, the active mass
of the electrode was found to be 1 mg.
