A green
and environmentally friendly route of no thinning agent
was designed to prepare sebacic acid. Sodium ricinoleate was selected
as the raw material to carry out solid-phase cleavage in a tubular
furnace. The reaction parameters including catalyst, ratio of sodium
ricinoleate/KOH, reaction time, reaction temperature, and absolute
pressure were optimized to obtain a high yield of sebacic acid. A
satisfactory yield (70.2%) of sebacic acid was received in the presence
of 1% catalyst (Fe2O3) by weight (w/w), with
5:4 (w/w) ratio of sodium ricinoleate/KOH at 543 K under the absolute
pressure of 0.09 MPa in 60 min. Sebacic acid was identified by gas
chromatography analysis, and the purity (98.1%) of the product was
further assessed by its melting point (306.3 K). Alkaline enhancement
generates a better cracking effect. The yield of sebacic acid can
be improved by a certain absolute pressure as a result of avoiding
oxidation of sodium ricinoleate as well as reducing the residence
time of hydrogen.

==== Body
Introduction
Castor oil is a fatty oil obtained by
extracting and refining from
the mature seeds of the castor plant (Ricinus communis L.).1 Due to high content of ricinoleic
acid,2−6 it is used in a variety of applications including medicine, chemicals
industry, and other technologies.7 Alkali
fusion is one of the unit processes involved in converting castor
oil to chemical intermediates with 8–10 carbon atoms.8 Sebacic acid (C10H18O4) is the main product of alkali fusion. As a saturated aliphatic
dicarboxylic acid containing ten carbon atoms, with the chemical similarity
of saturated dibasic acid, this important chemical raw material9 has been widely used in producing high-temperature-resistant
lubricant, high-temperature lubricating oil such as isopropyl sebacate,
artificial perfume such as diethyl sebacate, high-quality engineering
plastics such as nylon-610, and biodegradable polyesters for the medical
industry.10−14

Sebacic acid remained the highest castor oil derivatives consumed
in 2015 and held more than 20% of the global market revenue.15 China is a major producer of sebacic acid, and
the production capacity of sebacic acid in some Chinese factories
including Hebei Kaide Biomaterials Co., Ltd. and Hebei Hengshui Jinghua
Chemical Co., Ltd. has reached over 40 000 tons per year.16 They produce sebacic acid by alkali fusion of
castor oil in a tank reactor using phenol as a thinning agent, which
is detrimental to the environment and hard to be separated.17 Although many new methods to prepare sebacic
acid have been developed recently, including microwave-induced18 and electrolytic adipic acid;19 these are too difficult to apply to large-scale industrial
production. Therefore, the improvement of the cracking process is
particularly important.

Different reactions occur as temperature
changes, which is accomplished
with NaOH or KOH at elevated temperatures and in the presence of catalysts
to split the ricinoleate molecule in either a batch or a continuous
process.20−24 For example, upon heating at 523 K in the presence of NaOH, sebacic
acid is produced.8 To explain the reaction,
a detailed reaction mechanism has been proposed (Figure 1).1

Figure 1 Mechanism
of preparing sebacic acid.

In this reaction, because alkaline soaps resulting from alkali
fusion are relatively hard, poor heat conductors, and practically
impossible to be mixed by mechanical agitation, it is common practice
to carry out the cracking process in the presence of a thinning agent.25 Logan et al. used certain isocarboxylic acids,
isoaldehydes, and isoalcohols as thinning agents in the alkali fusion
of ricinoleic acid.26 Dou et al. obtained
sebacic acid by using a multicomponent acid diluent containing more
than two types of organic C7–C14 acids.27 In addition, mineral oils have been used by Shen as thinning
agents.28

Splitting decomposition
can be carried out in a tubular furnace.
Compared with liquid-phase cleavage in a tank reactor, tubular furnace
can be used for the solid-phase cleavage to avoid the addition of
thinning agent, which generates better effect of heat preservation,
higher uniformity of temperature, and higher heat efficiency caused
by larger heat transfer per unit volume;29 as a result, temperature can be controlled precisely and stably
in the tubular furnace. So, a green reaction without the thinning
agent for preparing sebacic acid by solid-phase cleavage was carried
out in the tubular furnace.

The present study aims at designing
a green process without a thinning
agent for obtaining a high yield of sebacic acid and, simultaneously,
investigating and optimizing reaction parameters of solid-phase cleavage
including catalyst, ratio of sodium ricinoleate/KOH, reaction temperature,
reaction time, and absolute pressure. Furthermore, the effect of alkaline
strength on yield is also explored.

Results and Discussion
Calculation
of Theoretical Yield of Sebacic Acid
Ricinoleic
acid (82.8 wt %) was determined as the main fatty acid component of
castor oil by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Hence, after saponification,
sodium ricinoleate (82.8 wt %) was determined as the main content
of saponified castor oil. Theoretical yield of sebacic acid was calculated
according to the reaction mechanism (Figure 1) using the relative percent of sodium ricinoleate
content of the saponified oil.

Reaction Parameters of
Solid-Phase Cleavage
The function
of a catalyst is to oxidize the aldehyde of decanoic acid to form
more sebacic acid, thereby inhibiting the formation of 10-hydroxydecanoic
acid. Catalysts with different oxidizabilities were selected to investigate
their effect on the yield of sebacic acid.

Table 1 shows the effect of different
catalysts on the yield of sebacic acid using KOH/sodium ricinoleate
in the ratio of 5:4 at 563 K under 0.09 MPa absolute pressure in 60
min. As seen in Table 1, metal oxides of high chemical valence such as Pb3O4 generate better catalytic effect than the inferior counterparts
such as CuO. Although the color value of the product can be increased
by the bleaching effect of ZnO, a yield of just 62.2% was obtained.
Cu2O, as a metal oxide of intermediate valence, has both
oxidizability and reductibility and was mainly used for absorbing
hydrogen instead of catalyzing, thereby promoting the chemical equilibrium
transfer in the direction of forming sebacic acid. The reaction processed
in a certain absolute pressure; hydrogen, once generated, was extracted
by the pump immediately, and there was no obvious influence of adding
Cu2O on the yield. Although a higher yield of sebacic acid
can be obtained by using Pb3O4 compared with
Fe2O3 under the same cracking condition, the
improvement is limited. Compared with Fe, Pb is a highly polluting
heavy metal. Hence, Fe2O3, an environmentally
friendly and nontoxic oxide,30 is determined
as the environmentally friendly catalyst with satisfactory catalytic
performance. As the oxidizability of the catalyst increased, the yield
of the final product was improved. Fe2O3 was
considered to be the most optimum catalyst.

Cu2O	1.0	58.5	
According to Table 1, the yield was influenced by different additive amount
of Fe2O3. The yield of sebacic acid was improved
obviously
with the increase of additive amount and reached the peak at 1%, beyond
which the yield nearly remained stable (1.5 and 2%). Therefore, the
most suitable ratio of Fe2O3 was determined
(1%).

The results represented in Table 2 show the effect of sodium ricinoleate/alkali
ratio
on the yield of sebacic acid in the presence of 1% Fe2O3 at 563 K under 0.09 MPa absolute pressure in 60 min. The
yield of sebacic acid increased with the increase of KOH proportion
up to the ratio of 5:4 (sodium ricinoleate/KOH), beyond which it changed
little. Therefore, the ratio of sodium ricinoleate/KOH at 5:4 was
considered as the optimum use level.

5:2	18.6	
NaOH	5:4	52.1	
A control experiment with
the ratio of 5:4 (sodium ricinoleate/NaOH)
at the same condition was carried out to investigate the effect on
the yield of sebacic acid with different alkali, merely 52.1% of the
theoretical yield was obtained. Due to alkaline enhancement, the yield
of sebacic acid was improved obviously. KOH was selected to replace
NaOH due to its stronger alkalinity, which is beneficial for not only
isomerization but also the transformation of sebacic acid from C-10
aldehyde acid. Hence, potassium hydrate generates better effects than
the traditionally used sodium hydrate. The stronger the alkalinity,
the higher is the yield of sebacic acid.

Table 3 illustrates
the effect of reaction time on the yield of sebacic acid during the
solid-phase cleavage using ricinoleate/KOH ratio of 5:4, 1% Fe2O3, 563 K reaction temperature, and 0.09 MPa absolute
pressure. As presented in Table 3, 17.7% increase of sebacic acid was observed with
the increase of reaction time from 30 to 60 min because the reactants
cannot be completely pyrolyzed over a short period. The obtained result
showed that 60 min is the optimum reaction time, beyond which the
yield of sebacic acid gradually decreases, which may be attributed
to the degradation and volatilization of sebacic acid. Larger heat
transfer area of tubular furnace ensures a higher heat efficiency,
which makes reactants to react rapidly. Heat loss is avoided because
of better air tightness under vacuum system and no need of stirring.
Hence, tubular furnace has a better temperature-controlling system
compared with tank reactor, ensuring the stability of the reaction.
Because of higher heat efficiency and better heat transfer, reaction
time is reduced dramatically. The extension of reaction time causes
the mass formation of various side-products. Therefore, controlling
the reaction time is quite necessary to obtain a high yield of sebacic
acid.

Reaction temperature has an important influence on
the yield of
sebacic acid because different reactions occur in different temperature
ranges. Table 4 shows
the effect of reaction temperature using sodium ricinoleate/KOH ratio
of 5:4, 1% Fe2O3, 0.09 MPa absolute pressure,
and 60 min reaction time. Low reaction temperature such as 513 K cannot
obtain a high yield of sebacic acid due to the formation of large
amount of side product (10-hydroxydecanoic acid). The yield of sebacic
acid increased rapidly with the increase of reaction temperature up
to 543 K and changed little at a further increase of 20 K. With the
increase of temperature to 593 K, the yield of the final product decreased
to some extent. Charred and polymerized oil molecules are the possible
reasons for the decreased yield. Therefore, the most suitable reaction
temperature was determined to be 543 K.

To further
explore the effect of oxygen on the yield of sebacic
acid, solid-phase cleavage was carried out on the ratio of sodium
ricinoleate/KOH of 5:4 in the presence of 1% Fe2O3 at 543 K under standard atmosphere for 60 min; the yield was 61.1%
of the theoretical value. As shown in Table 5, compared with that, adding 1% antioxidant
MD-1024 at the same condition results in an obvious decrease of 7.7%.
Air is inevitably left in the furnace. The larger the amount of heat
needed for heating this air, the lower is the furnace efficiency;31 this results in a decrease of yield. Double
bonds in sodium ricinoleate (C=O and C=C) are easily
oxidized by residual oxygen in the tubular furnace, especially when
the temperature rises, and this circumstance can be prevented by adding
antioxidant or vacuum system. Since the addition of antioxidant may
cause an adverse effect on the quality of sebacic acid, vacuum environment
is a better choice.

The experiment concerning
different absolute pressures was carried
out on the ratio of sodium ricinoleate/KOH of 4:5 in the presence
of 1% Fe2O3 at 543 K in 60 min. As presented
in Table 5, with the
increase of the absolute pressure, the yield of sebacic acid improved
from 68.5% (0.03 MPa) to 70.2% (0.09 MPa). From Figure 1, after retro-aldol fission, C-10 aldehyde
acid can either react with hydrogen to form 10-hydroxydecanoic acid
or form sebacic acid under the action of excessive alkali. As the
absolute pressure increases, the residence time of hydrogen is shortened
because hydrogen generated by dehydrogenation of sodium ricinoleate
is removed by the vacuum pump in time, which inhibits the formation
of the side product 10-hydroxydecanoic acid, thereby promoting the
reaction to proceed in the desirable direction.

Identification
and Characterization
Sebacic acid was
confirmed by GC analysis, affording the purity of 98.1%. High purity
of sebacic acid was further assessed by its melting point (306.3 K).

Conclusions
The present study establishes a process of solid-phase
cleavage
without thinning agents to prepare sebacic acid using sodium ricinoleate
and KOH as raw materials, Fe2O3 as catalyst,
and tubular furnace as reactor. It is concluded that the optimum conditions
for cracking are 5:4 ratio of sodium ricinoleate/KOH and 1% Fe2O3 at 543 K reaction temperature under 0.09 MPa
absolute pressure and 60 min reaction time; this result in sebacic
acid of 70.2% yield with 98.1% purity.

Sodium ricinoleate was
selected as the raw material to replace
other oleochemicals such as castor oil or ricinoleate acid because
of its different physical property (solid at room temperature); this
enables reactants (sodium ricinoleate, alkali and catalyst) to be
ground into powder and premixed sufficiently to process solid-phase
cleavage, thereby avoiding using thinning agents. However, in this
process, the heat transfer is restricted to some extent, which means
that the yield of sebacic acid cannot be improved further.

Several
common metal oxides were used as catalysts, compared with
Pb3O4, Fe2O3 was determined
as a catalyst not only for high catalytic efficiency but also for
its nontoxicity, ensuring that the entire route is environmentally
friendly. Alkali plays an important part in the cracking reaction,
and potassium hydrate generates better effect on yield than sodium
hydrate due to stronger alkalinity. The reaction time was accelerated
due to higher heat efficiency of tubular furnace. The yield of sebacic
acid is further increased in the vacuum system, since the oxidation
of sodium ricinoleate is avoided. Different absolute pressure experiments
show that the process is influenced by the residence time of hydrogen,
removing H2 in time is beneficial for the formation of
sebacic acid.

Experimental Section
Materials
Castor
oil was purchased from Tian Xing biotechnology
Co., Ltd (Shandong, China) and saponified castor oil was used in experiments.
NaOH and KOH were purchased from Bodi chemical engineering Co., Ltd
(Tianjin, China). Antioxidant MD-1024 was purchased from Bailingwei
Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). All catalysts were purchased
from Zhiyuan chemical reagent Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China). All chemicals
used were of analytical grade.

Pyrolysis of Sodium Ricinoleate
Castor oil was presaponified
with triple molar amount of NaOH to prepare sodium ricinoleate. Sodium
ricinoleate, KOH (5:2, 5:3, 5:4, 5:5; sodium ricinoleate/alkali (w/w)),
and catalyst such as Fe2O3 (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5%)
were ground into powder. To prevent quartz (silicon dioxide) from
reacting with alkali, a homemade cylindrical hollow sleeve of stainless
steel (32 cm H × 3.2 cm D) was inserted in the quartz tube of
tubular furnace (GL-1200-3, Si Yang precision equipment Co., Ltd)
in which the reactants were placed. Two ends of tubular furnace were
connected to the water spray device and the condensation recovery
device, respectively. The vacuum pump was turned on before the furnace
was heated up. The temperature of the tubular furnace was increased
from room temperature to 373 K and maintained for 10 min to preheat
the reactants and then rapidly reached the reaction temperature in
5 min. Superheated water steam of 453 K was ejected into the tubular
furnace at a material flow of 0.5 g/min when reached reaction temperature,
and lasting for the whole cracking process. Different reaction temperatures
(513–593 K), reaction times (30–120 min), and absolute
pressures (0.03–0.09 MPa) were set up to investigate the optimal
parameters. After the reaction, the solid production was maintained
in the stainless steel sleeve, 2-octanol and excessive H2O were recovered by condensation, and a small amount of H2 was evacuated by vacuum pump. The cracking setup is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Cracking setup.

Separation of Sebacic Acid
The solid product was diluted
with hot water in a glass container and acidified to pH 6.0 with 3
mol/L H2SO4, some insoluble monosodium salt
of fatty acid suspended in the upper layer of the solution, and precipitated
10-hydroxydecanoic acid. After separation and filtration, the remaining
solution was first decolorized by activated carbon and then acidified
to pH 2.0 using 3 mol/L H2SO4. On the one hand,
solid product was precipitated at the bottom of the container, recovered
by filtration, and dried in an air-dry oven at 353 K for 12 h to obtain
the final sebacic acid. On the other hand, sulfate, the main content
of the filtrate, is collected by distillation. The flow chart is shown
in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Reaction flow
chart.

Characterization of Castor
Oil and Sebacic Acid
Fatty
acid composition of castor oil was determined by gas chromatography
(GC-9800, Shanghai Kechuang chromatographic instrument Co., Ltd.)
of fatty acid methyl esters prepared according to the AOAC method.32 An CBP capillary column (50 m × 0.25 mm
i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) was used with nitrogen as a carrier
gas (1.0 mL/min). The injection temperature was 553 K, the column
temperature was kept at 393 K for 5 min, and programmed to 513 K at
a rate of 5 K/min. The detector temperature was 553 K. Relative percentages
of the compounds were calculated by GC-FID, thereby calculating the
content of sodium ricinoleate in saponified castor oil. Theoretical
yield of the obtained product was calculated by the GC results.

The identification of sebacic acid was also confirmed by GC of its
methyl esters. For the GC analysis, an CBP capillary column (50 m
× 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) was used with nitrogen
as a carrier gas (1.0 mL/min). The injection temperature was 553 K,
the column temperature was started at 393 K and programmed to 513
K at a rate of 5 K/min, and the detector temperature was 553 K. High
purity of sebacic acid was further confirmed by its melting point.33
