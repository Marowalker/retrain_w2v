Medical cannabis
has been legally available for patients in a number
of countries. Licensed producers produce a variety of cannabis strains
with different concentrations of phytocannabinoids. Phytocannabinoids
in medical cannabis are decarboxylated when subjected to heating for
consumption by the patients or when extracted for preparing cannabis
derivative products. There is little understanding of the true chemical
composition of cannabis extracts, changes occurring during heating
of the extracts, and their relevance to pharmacological effects. We
investigated the extract from a popular commercial strain of medical
cannabis, prior to and after decarboxylation, to understand the chemical
profiles. A total of up to 62 compounds could be identified simultaneously
in the extract derived from commercial cannabis, including up to 23
phytocannabinoids. Upon heating, several chemical changes take place,
including the loss of carboxylic group from the acidic phytocannabinoids.
This investigation attempts to reveal the chemical complexity of commercial
medical cannabis extracts and the differences in the chemical composition
of the native extract and the one subjected to heat. Comprehensive
chemical analyses of medical cannabis extracts are needed for standardization,
consistency, and, more importantly, an informed employment of this
substance for therapeutic purposes.

Introduction
Cannabis spp. plant
and its products are controlled drug substances
across international borders, and their possession is illegal in many
countries. This species of plants produce a distinct group of chemicals
called phytocannabinoids.1,2 Due to the psychoactive
effects of few phytocannabinoids, Cannabis spp. plants and their derivative
products are either regulated or banned. In Canada, cannabis has been
available for medicinal purposes since 1999 to patients who obtain
a prescription for the same from a physician.3 In the recent years, commercial medicinal cannabis in Canada is
produced by licensed producers, who carry a variety of strains with
several variations in the phytocannabinoid content.

Cannabis
spp. contains a highly complex mixture of compounds, and
up to 568 unique molecules are identified in the cannabis to date.1,2 a Among these compounds, Δ9-THC, cannabinol (CBN), and cannabinodiol (CBND) are known
to be psychoactive.2 One must note that
the concentrations of all of these compounds may not even be at the
detectable levels or not present in many commercial cannabis strains;
hence, physiological significance of all of these compounds is irrelevant,
except those that can be detected. Other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol
(CBD) are nonpsychoactive compounds. Cannabinoids exert their physiological
effects through a variety of receptors including adrenergic receptors,
cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), and a variety of other recently
discovered GPCRs such as GPR55, GPR3, GPR5, among others.2,4 Patients consume medical cannabis, often with little medical evidence,
for the treatment of or to seek relief from a variety of clinical
conditions including pain, anxiety, epileptic seizures, nausea, appetite
stimulation, and so on.5−8 Chemical composition, pharmacological profiling, and complete physiological
effects of these medicinal plants, and more importantly the extracts
from cannabis, remain to be fully understood.9,10

A small group of commercial suppliers, typically able to produce
hundreds of kilograms of medical cannabis annually, are providing
medical cannabis to majority of patients, along with some home-grown
cannabis as well as some small-scale producers in Canada; a large
variety of cannabis plants with large variations in phytocannabinoids
content thus exists, and an online store lists up to 542 different
strains available as medical cannabis.11 This is a result of the existing legal medical marijuana regulatory
system, where each patient or even someone with a license to grow
could grow any varieties in small quantities, typically sufficient
for a handful of patients’ consumption. These are not necessarily
produced by large commercial manufacturers. Cannabis-derived extracts
(resins) are becoming popular commercially as well, and many patients
prefer to use these extracts, as they do not involve smoking.

Previous studies have analyzed cannabis extracts in the context
of understanding the chemical variations and classifying the Cannabis
spp. plants.12−14 In a study published by Hazecamp and Fischedick,
the authors compared two popular strains of cannabis samples from
the coffee shops dispersed geographically in the Netherlands. Samples
were collected and analyzed for 28 major compounds; extraction was
conducted with organic solvents such as hexanes and ethanol.12 Their data were analyzed by principal component
analysis to classify these cannabis samples into distinct chemovar
groups. In a separate study, 11 cannabis varieties grown under controlled
and similar environmental conditions were analyzed by gas chromatography
for 36 compounds and classified these varieties using these compounds
profiling.13 Elzinga et al. conducted chemical
analyses on 494 cannabis flower samples and 170 extracts, correlating
31 compounds including phytocannabinoids and terpenes.15 In this study, a continuum of chemical composition
was identified among various cannabis strains collected from patients
in California. There was also variability in the chemical composition
of the same strain.

Commercial medical cannabis, in its dried
form, is consumed by
patients in a number of ways including smoking, vaping, edibles, and
infused edible oils. Phytocannabinoids in the dried cannabis generally
carry a carboxylic acid moiety and undergo spontaneous loss of this
carboxyl moiety when subjected to high temperature (either direct
sunlight, smoking, hot oven, and similar heat sources) (Figure 1). Cannabinoid acids generally
bind at the cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, with weaker affinity
and exhibit weaker activity,16 but the
corresponding decarboxylated phytocannabinoids exhibit higher potency
at these receptors.17 Thus, dried cannabis
in general is subjected to activation (via decarboxylation) prior
to consumption by the patients for maximal in vivo efficacy. Cannabis
extracts, on the other hand, are typically produced by either direct
infusion into various edible oils at moderate temperatures or by employing
supercritical fluid extraction. However, very little is investigated
about the chemistry of commercial varieties, the effect of heating
on the chemicals in medical cannabis, and their effects on the physiological
systems. To understand the effects of heating, the extraction and
analytical tools must be also be able to adequately address the chemical
changes. To our knowledge, there is no study involving medical cannabis
in this context, including from the Canadian market, which is the
focus of this investigation. Overall, commercial medical cannabis
is significantly underexplored, and it is a potential source for novel
bioactive compounds as well.18

Figure 1 Biosynthesis
of major phytocannabinoids.19,20,24,26

During the biosynthesis of various phytocannabinoids, cannabigerolic
acid (1, CBGA) serves as the key branching point for
a number of cannabinoids such as Δ9-THC, CBD, cannabielsoin
(CBE), cannabichromene (CBC), and cannabicyclol (CBL) families of
phytocannabinoids (Figure 1).19−21 CBGA is synthesized from geraniol and C12-polyketides catalyzed by CBGA synthase in Cannabis.22,23 This biosynthetic pathway consists of four
types of reactions: enzyme catalysis, thermal reaction, oxidation,
and irradiation (Figure 1). The conversion of CBGA into Δ9-THCA, cannabidiolic
acid (CBDA), and cannabichromenic acid (CBCA) is catalyzed by the
corresponding synthases (Figure 1).19,20 CBCA (4) and CBC
(10) can be further converted to cannabicyclolic acid
(CBLA) (5) and CBL (11), respectively, when
exposed to UV light irradiation.24,25 Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) is transformed
into CBN (12) through an oxidative aromatization,19 and CBN can in turn be photochemically rearranged
into the catechol, cannabinodiol (CBND) (13).26

As Canada is poised to legalize marijuana
for recreational purposes
with the legislation pending in 2018, and hundreds of thousands of
Canadians consume commercially available cannabis strains for the
treatment of a variety of ailments, we sought to undertake a chemical
approach to investigate the constituents in one particular variety
of medicinal cannabis. Most common strains available in Canada tend
to carry high concentrations of Δ9-THC with minimal
or insignificant amount of CBD, or a balanced amount of Δ9-THC/CBD (approximately 6–12% of each), or high concentration
of CBD with insignificant amount of Δ9-THC. In the
current study, one of the most popular strains carrying 7–9%
(w/w) each of Δ9-THC and CBD in the dried cannabis
was considered and obtained from one of the largest commercial vendors
in the country. When both CBD and Δ9-THC are produced
by the plant, most of the biosynthetic pathway is actively functioning,
and one expects to find appropriate intermediates en route to these
final products (Figure 1). This is in contrast to a plant that is producing high amount of
CBD, where Δ9-THC-related intermediates would be
downregulated, and a similar rationale could be applied to a variety
that is high in Δ9-THC. In addition, most of the
current cannabis industry is focusing on plant extracts (cannabis
resin) and is expected to grow as medical cannabis attains more acceptance
in the healthcare community, warranting investigations on cannabis
resin. Thus, we were interested in identifying as many chemicals as
possible simultaneously, and pre- and post-decarboxylation,
laying the foundation for studies involving medical cannabis extracts,
and relating such changes to the pharmacological effects. Here, we
report the extraction of dried medical cannabis, its analyses, and
identification of the compounds potentially present in the extract.
In this context, biosynthetic pathway for phytocannabinoids is also
discussed to establish a relationship with the potential compounds
in the cannabis extract. These findings are a stepping stone for further
comprehensive chemical analyses of cannabis varieties that are currently
made available to the patients and for an objective analysis of their
pharmacological effects.

Results and Discussion
Most popular
methods for cannabis consumption, especially in the
context of decarboxylation and administration of phytocannabinoids
include the use of vaporizers with controlled heating or smoking medical
cannabis. It is not only very difficult to dose patients in this manner
because of the variabilities that might exist in the plant material,
but also how each patient inhales. Thus, the extracts of medical cannabis
are gaining popularity very quickly, especially in Canada, where a
pharmaceutical grade extract preparation is a potential possibility,
thus providing one the ability to prepare appropriate dosage forms
for administration by patients. Chemical experiments involving activation
or decarboxylation are very limited on the extracts, if any. There
is no standard process employed in the industry and still rudimentary
methods such as “industrial ovens” are widely used to
accomplish the decarboxylation. To the best of our knowledge, no true
chemical analyses-driven process has been implemented. Thus, we undertook
this investigation to consider a popular variety of
medical cannabis that produces Δ9-THC and CBD (hence,
all of the other intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway) to understand
the native cannabis resin and activated cannabis resin.

We extracted
dried cannabis for phytocannabinoids using supercritical
fluid extraction (SFE), which can be carried out at ambient temperature,
so that this native extract contains chemicals that are as close as
possible to their natural form in the dried cannabis. The cannabis
extract was also subjected to heat (up to 170 °C) to obtain the
corresponding decarboxylated cannabis extract. These extracts were
analyzed to compare and contrast the chemical changes before and after
decarboxylation. Although such decarboxylation and any chemical change
is not equivalent to the changes that occur during smoking or vaping,
these changes reflect the extraction processes and heat-induced decarboxylations
(industrial ovens, etc.) employed in the industry to prepare various
cannabis extracts and capsules filled with extracts.

Chemical
extraction and decarboxylation processes employed in this
study did not involve exposure to light and oxidative conditions (other
than the oxygen present in the reaction vessel and in the solvent),
thus limiting the potential for the formation of CBN and CBND. CBC
(10) is derived from cannabigerol (CBG) (6) in an oxidative cyclization reaction during the biosynthesis.19

Native Cannabis Extract
Native cannabis
extract was
obtained from dried cannabis employing SFE at 25 °C to minimize
spontaneous decarboxylation of cannabinoid acids, such as CBGA (1), Δ9-THCA (2), and CBDA (3), catalyzed by the extraction process and to obtain the
chemical composition as close as possible to that in the commercial
dried cannabis. This extract was analyzed on a ultra performance liquid
chromatography (UPLC) equipped with a mass detector in both the negative
(ES −ve) and positive (ES +ve) scan modes. Mass spectral analyses
revealed 23 unique signals (m/z):
301.15, 329.14, 331.24, 343.17, 357.20, 371.16, 373.26, 375.21, 389.25,
399.30, 417.31, 457.08, 473.50, 493.32, 509.45, 593.32 in the negative
mode ([M – H]−), and 220.14, 250.23, 315.33,
341.37, and 373.34 in the positive mode ([M + H]+) (Figure 2 and Table 1). The signals at 371.16 (m/z, ES −ve) and 373.34 (m/z, ES +ve) corresponded to the same molecular
weight, thus the total number of unique signals was concluded to be
22 after consolidating both scan modes.

resin and the corresponding compounds. Numbers in bold are the mass

Dried cannabis
contains a wide variety of compounds, including
cannabinoids, terpenoids, flavonoids, hydrocarbons, fatty acids, phenols,
and other miscellaneous classes of compounds and their metabolites.
A comprehensive literature analyses and the above chemical analyses
of mass spectral signals led us to identify up to 62 unique compounds
in the cannabis extract attributable to the above 22 unique signals
based on the corresponding molecular weights of the compounds or the
corresponding fragments (Figure 2 and Table 1).

Among these 62 compounds, β-caryophyllene oxide,
a sesquiterpene
found in cannabis, was observed with its molecular signal at 221.14
Da (m/z, [M + H]+). Roughanic
acid, stearidonic acid, and α-linolenic acid, which are polyunsaturated
fatty acids, were observed with the molecular weights 251.23, 277.27,
and 279.30 Da, respectively (signals 2–4 in Table 1). Stearidonic
acid is found in abundance in the seeds of Cannabis spp., and roughanic
acid is a component of storage lipids commonly found in a wide variety
of plants including cannabis.27 Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabiorcolic acid (C1-Δ9-THCRA), a lighter-chain phytocannabinoid than Δ9-THCA (2) due to its small hydrocarbon tail with
one carbon atom instead of five, was observed at 301.15 Da (m/z, [M – H]−).
The molecular peak at 301.15 Da (m/z) could also indicate the presence of flavonoid, quercetin, and noncannabinoid,
4,5-dihydroxy-2,3,6-trimethoxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (signal 5 in Table 1).

A low-intensity signal at 315.33 Da (m/z, [M + H]+) indicated the potential presence
of multiple neutral phytocannabinoids cannabicitran, Δ8-THC, Δ9-THC, CBC, CBD, and the degradation product
CBL in relatively small quantities (signal 6 in Table 1). Majority of the
phytocannabinoids in the extract were found in the form of C3- or C5-carboxylic acids and in the form of neutral phytocannabinoid
derivatives, as expected; these compounds were identified based on
the strong signals at 329.14, 331.24, and 357.20 Da (m/z, [M – H]−), corresponding
to the molecular weights of 20 cannabinoid derivatives (signals 7, 8, and 11, respectively, in Table 1). The signal at 341.37
Da (m/z, [M + H]+) is
due to the fragmentation of the C5-cannabinoid acids, namely,
Δ9-THCA, CBDA, CBCA, and CBLA after losing the hydroxyl
moiety of the carboxylic acid (mass transition from 357.37 →
340.37 Da; signal 9 in Table 1 and Figure 3). CBGA was not detected in its molecular form, but
two signals, at 331.24 Da and 343.13 (m/z, [M – H]−), attributed to the loss of an
ethyl group (360 → 331 Da) from the hydrocarbon tail and a
hydroxyl moiety from the carboxylic group (360 → 343 Da) of
CBGA, respectively, confirmed the presence of CBGA in the cannabis
extract (signals 8 and 10, respectively,
in Table 1 and Figure 2).

Figure 3 Fragmentation patterns
for (A) orientin (17), (B)
cannabisin A (18), (C) Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic
acid (19), and (D) cannabigerolic acid (20, CBGA).

Further mass spectral analyses
led to the identification of the
signal at 399.30 (m/z, [M –
H]−) and empirical formula for this molecular peak
was deduced to be C24H32O5,28 corresponding to the molecular weight of an
ethyl aldehyde or acetyl analogue of Δ9-THCA (Figure 2 and signal 16 in Table 1). On the basis of the known metabolism patterns for Δ9-THCA, one may conceive several possible structures for this
phytocannabinoid derivative, that is, Δ9-THCA + C2H2O, but further structural analyses will need
to be undertaken for further structural elucidation. This compound
with the empirical formula Δ9-THCA + C2H2O was first described in 2015 by Nascimento et al.28

In addition to these derivatives, we identified
one cannabinoid
monoethyl ether derivative, two derivatives of phytocannabinoid acids,
and three miscellaneous cannabinoids in the mass range of 371–399
Da (signals 12–16, ES −ve, Table 1). The mass spectral
signal (m/z) at 417.31 could not
be attributed to any molecular peak, but a fragment of the flavonoid,
orientin, is proposed as a candidate ion with the loss of −CH2OH moiety equivalent to 31 Da (448 → 417 transition, Figure 3A and signal 17 in Table 1). Molecules with m/z higher than
400 Da include acetyl stigmasterol, a terpenoid with a molecular weight
of 458.08 (signal 18 in Table 1). The mass spectral signal at 473.50 Da
(m/z, [M – H]−) matches the fragment of cannabisin A (signal 19 in Table 1), where the loss
of 4-ethylphenolic moiety generates this fragment (594 → 473
Da transition; Figure 3A). Four potential compounds corresponded to the signal at 493.32
Da (m/z, signal 20 in Table 1), where the conjugates
of Δ9-THCA with bulky fenchol, terpenol, and borneol
moieties resulted in these high-molecular-weight phytocannabinoids
derivatives. The signal at 509.45 (m/z, ES −ve) indicated the presence of decarboxylated chlorophyll
(signal 21 in Table 1 and Figure 2); such a decarboxylation could occur during the extraction
process (Figure 4).29 The mass spectral signal 22 (m/z = 594.52Da, [M – H]−; Table 1) corresponded
to the flavonoid derivative, apigenin-6,8-di-C-β-d-glucopyranoside, and the lignanamide derivative, cannabisin
A.

Several compounds have been identified
to be potentially present
in the cannabis (up to 568a) that were not detected
in the cannabis extract analyzed in this study, including some members
of terpenoids, spermidine alkaloids, amides, lignanamide derivatives,
flavonoids, fatty acids, additional cannabinoid esters, and noncannabinoid
phenols, in the molecular weight range of 112–815 Da. Part
of the reason is that, in our current analysis, we did not conduct
any
fractionation or enrichment of the extract, thus the natural abundance
of all of the compounds determined their detectability. For example,
the phytocannabinoid, Δ9-THCA-A-COOH,28 was not detected in the cannabis extract as
were lignanamide derivatives, grossamide (MW 624.68), and cannabisins
B–D (MW = 594.61–624.68). Similarly, cannabinoid heterodimers,
which were known to exist in the mass (m/z) range of 637–717 Da ([M – H]−) were also not detected.28

In this
native cannabis extract from the commercial dried cannabis,
the most intense signal (m/z) was
observed at 357.20 Da [M – H]−, which corresponds
to up to five phytocannabinoid carboxylic acids, Δ9-THCA, CBDA, CBCA, and CBLA; there were lower-intensity signals (m/z) at 315.33 Da [M + H]+ (corresponding
to Δ9-THC, CBD, CBC, CBL), 329.14 Da [M –
H]− (corresponding to CBE) and at 373.26 Da [M –
H]− (corresponding to cannabielsoic acid (CBEA)).
CBN and CBND were not detected; however, CBE and its acid precursor
CBEA appears to be in trace quantities in this native cannabis extract,
based on the peak intensities. These two later compounds could have
been derived from CBD and CBDA via either photo-oxidation or exposure
to heat within the plant tissue, as well.26

Five signals in the range of 371–399 Da (m/z, [M – H]−; peaks 12–16 in Table 1) may confirm up to 11 known phytocannabinoid
derivatives in the extract; these compounds are a result of common
modifications including hydroxylation, methoxylation, acetylation,
and epoxidation. Additional seven phytocannabinoids with relatively
low molecular weight potentially are present in the cannabis extract,
which correspond to the two signals in the range of 330–332
Da (m/z, [M – H]−; signals 7 and 8 in Table 1). Depending on the position and nature of
the modifications on the cannabinoid ring system, these molecules
could either be precursors or metabolites of the active phytocannabinoids.
For example, Δ9-THC and Δ9-THCA
are commonly modified at positions 8 and 11 (i.e., 11-hydroxy-Δ9-THCA, Δ9-THCA-8-one, and 8β,11-bis-hydroxy-Δ9-THCA),28 whereas CBG and CBGA tend to undergo epoxidation at their
6 and 7 positions (i.e., 6,7-cis/trans-epoxy-CBGA) (Figure 5).

Activated Cannabis Extract
(Post-decarboxylation)
Phytocannabinoids
such as compounds 1–3 are decarboxylated when
exposed to heat, and the rates of decarboxylation differ for different
phytocannabinoids. It is known that the decarboxylated phytocannabinoids
are more potent than the corresponding carboxylic acid forms (vide
supra). In the current environment, patients use cannabis either by
smoking (subjecting the material to higher than 200 °C) or using
temperature-controlled vaporizers, exposing cannabis to less than
200 °C in a controlled fashion, or baking, among other methods.
All of these methods are employed by the patients individually for
their own consumption; in addition, the extracts and resins are produced
in commercial settings where heating is employed disproportionately.
In either scenario, there is little understanding of the chemical
changes and the chemicals. In the current industrial setting in Canada,
there is no standard process employed, and still rudimentary methods
such as industrial ovens are used to accomplish the decarboxylation,
which is also not regulated. No true chemical analyses-driven process
is implemented to our knowledge in the commercial processes producing
medical cannabis extracts. Thus, decarboxylation (or activation) of
phytocannabinoids produced in the plant is an important step for the
full efficacy of cannabis extract. Due to the inherent chemical variations
in the commercial cannabis strains, one would anticipate quite varied
analytical results when the cannabis extracts are subjected to heat.
Thus, we were interested in exploring the effect of heat on various
chemicals in the native cannabis extract, in addition to the phytocannabinoids
carboxylic acids such as 1–3.

We conducted the chemical comparison of the same commercial medical
cannabis strain extract in its native form and after subjecting it
to heat to decarboxylate phytocannabinoids carboxylates into their
active form. Chromatographic separation with mass spectral detection
revealed the chemical composition of this activated cannabis extract
(Figure 6). Seventeen
unique mass spectral signals (m/z) were identified: 313.30, 329.28, 357.27, 373.33, 389.46, 401.32,
457.94, 509.38, and 593.32 Da in the ES −ve scanning mode,
and 221.21, 277.35, 287.33, 301.36, 311.34, 315.40, 329.43, and 385.41
Da in the ES +ve scanning mode (Table 2). The mass spectral signals at 313.30 Da ([M –
H]−) and that at 315.40 Da ([M + H]+)
were considered to be originating from a single compound, with a molecular
weight of 314.35 Da. Thus, 16 unique signals were identified to be
representing up to 58 compounds in the decarboxylated cannabis extract,
including various phytocannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenes, and miscellaneous
compounds.

(decarboxylated) cannabis resin and the corresponding compounds. Numbers

Among these potential
58 compounds, up to 36 compounds are found
to be in the native cannabis extract (prior to decarboxylation) as
well, and did not change due to the decarboxylation process (Table 1 vs Table 2). The remaining 22 compounds
in the decarboxylated cannabis extract were not present in the native
cannabis extract (prior to decarboxylation), and admittedly, most
of these new compounds are the decarboxylated forms of phytocannabinoid
acids (Table 3, right
column). Among the other categories of compounds in the activated
cannabis extract, sesquiterpene, β-caryophyllene oxide, corresponded
to the signal at 221.21 Da ([M + H]+; signal 1 in Table 2). Similarly,
stearidonic acid was found at 277.35 Da (m/z, [M – H]−; signal 2 in Table 2). Two
fatty acids, roughanic acid and α-linolenic acid, were observed
in the native cannabis extract but were absent after subjecting the
extract to heat for decarboxylation.

Three C3-cannabinoids,
cannabichromevarin (CBCV), cannabidivarin
(CBDV), and Δ9-THCV, were attributed to the mass
spectral signal ([M + H+]) at 287.33 Da (signal 3 in Table 2). These
compounds are structurally similar to CBC, CBD, and Δ9-THC (i.e., C5-cannabinoids), respectively, except that
the side chain is an n-propyl moiety (C3) rather than an n-pentyl group (C5).
Unlike C5-cannabinoids, which behave as agonists at CB1
and CB2 receptors, C3-cannabinoids such as Δ9-THCV act as antagonists at CB1 receptor.27 Although C3-cannabinoid acids (CBCVA, Δ9-THCVA, and CBDVA) could potentially be present in both native
and activated cannabis extracts, decarboxylated C3-cannabinoids,
that is, CBCV, Δ9-THCV, and CBDV were only found
in the activated cannabis extract, as expected.

C4-Δ9-THC, a butyl analogue of Δ9-THC, was observed at 301.36 Da (m/z, [M + H]+; signal 4 in Table 2), and its precursor,
C4-Δ9-THCA, was found only in the native
cannabis extract. The mass spectral signal at 301.36 Da (m/z, [M + H]+) can also be attributed
to another C4-cannabinoid, C4-CBD, but there
was no comparable precursor, that is, C4-CBDA in the native
cannabis extract (i.e., prior to decarboxylation); hence, the presence
of C4-CBD was discounted in the activated cannabis extract
from the current cannabis strain.

The molecular ion at 311.34
Da (m/z, [M + H]+; signal 5 in Table 2) corresponded to three potential
cannabinoids: cannabinol (12), cannabinodiol (13), and cannabifuran (28).30 The first two compounds, 12 and 13 (CBN
and CBND, respectively), are derivatives of Δ9-THC
(7) and derived from the oxidation and photochemical
conversion reactions, respectively (Figure 1). It is unlikely that the heating in alcohol
promoted oxidation and/or photochemical conversion of Δ9-THC into CBN and CBND. Also, cannabifuran (28; Figure 5) is derived
from the oxidative cyclization of cannabidiol (signal 5 in Table 2). On the
basis of the current data, any or all of these compounds might comprise
this mass signal. Additionally, (−)-7R-cannabicourmarone1 with a signal at 329.43 Da (signal 7 in Table 2) suggested
the decarboxylation of (−)-7R-cannabicourmaronic
acid in the cannabis extract (m/z, [M + H]+; signal 12 in Table 1 and Figure 5).1 Six additional
compounds, cannabichromanone D (a neutral cannabinoid), 10-oxo-Δ6a-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol monoethylether, sesquicannabigerol,
flavonoids kaempferol (an antioxidant), and luteolin, were identified
in the activated cannabis extract that were not present in the native
extract, and these were attributed to signals 5 (m/z = 311.34 Da, [M + H]+), 6 (m/z = 315.40 Da, [M +
H]+), and 9 (m/z = 357.27, [M – H]−) (Table 2). This is an interesting observation because
one would expect these compounds to be present in the native cannabis
extract; it could not have been due to the extraction process, but
it is possible that they were present in a derivative form in the
native extract and were released upon heating.

The identities
of the compounds matching the mass spectral signal
at 401.32 Da (m/z, [M – H]−; signal 13 in Table 2) could not be attributed to any known compound
in cannabis; however, the molecular weight (402.32 Da) corresponding
to this signal suggested the empirical formula C24H34O5. Interestingly, this empirical formula has
two additional hydrogens than a known compound described in the literature,
C24H32O5 (Δ9-THCA
+ C2H2O), and was also identified in the native
cannabis extract (signal 16 in Table 1).20 Its presence
in the native cannabis extract obtained through SFE suggested a chemical
structure akin to THCA derivative in the activated cannabis extract,
that is, Δ9-THCA + C2H4O. This
empirical formula suggests a previously unknown hydroxyethyl derivative
of Δ9-THCA. Such a transformation may have occurred
during the heating of cannabis extract (decarboxylation process) in
ethanol; however, we could not rule out the possibility that this
mass spectral signal could be that of a molecular fragment of a heavier
compound.

Upon comparison of the chemical composition of the
cannabis extracts
prior to and after decarboxylation, signals corresponding to the molecular
weights of 26 compounds were not found in the decarboxylated cannabis
extract (Table 3, left
column). Absence of these compounds in the decarboxylated cannabis
extract can be mainly attributed to the decarboxylation of acidic
cannabinoids, or the loss of an ester moiety from cannabinoid esters.
Likewise, cannabinoid acids and their derivatives could be susceptible
to degradation when heated, although most of their direct degradation
products were not observed in the decarboxylated cannabis extract
in the current experiments.

In this investigation, we considered
one popular cannabis strain,
and thus the chemical changes cannot be generalized to all of the
strains of medical cannabis; these are limited to those strains that
carry a balanced Δ9-THC and CBD compounds (7–9%
each of Δ9-THC and CBD). Overall, one must view the
extracts from each strain or variety of medical cannabis as unique
substances because many chemicals get concentrated in the extract.
The present study is limited by its use of only one variety of medical
cannabis, albeit it is a popular variety. To limit any process-related
bias, we employed the SFE method at ambient temperature for the extraction
to facilitate the identification of compounds prior to heat exposure.
We used supercritical fluid (liquid CO2) and ethanol as
co-solvents for the extraction of as many chemicals as possible. Analysis
using a liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectral identification
provided the ability to identify most of the compounds, including
those that do not carry a chromophore.

When one correlates the
above chemical changes, effect of controlled
heating, changes in the chemical composition in addition to decarboxylated
phytocannabinoids, and attempt to correlate the pharmacological effects,
it is imperative to think that inconsistency in the extracts and decarboxylation
could have profound effects for the patient. Additional research in
this direction is certainly warranted to lead toward safe products
derived from the extracts of medical cannabis. Here, we disclose the
simultaneous identification of up to 62 chemicals including phytocannabinoids,
terpenes, fatty acids, and other common phytochemicals from one commercial
strain of medical cannabis available in Canada. We also disclosed
the chemical changes that occurred when one subjects the cannabis
extract to controlled, common heating conditions, and its relevance
to the biosynthesis of phytocannabinoids. As medical cannabis gains
more acceptance in the society and healthcare practitioners become
comfortable with the therapeutic benefits of this plant product, the
need for standardization and consistency of the chemical constituents
beyond Δ9-THC and CBD in the medical cannabis strains
is immediate. Furthermore, basic and clinical sciences supporting
proper dosage forms yielding adequate pharmacological activity and
outlining the potential adverse effects and risks of cannabis consumption
are also urgently needed; but these are immensely dependent on the
chemical constituents of the extracts consumed by the patients. Healthcare
practitioners would benefit from predictable dosing, a better understanding
of the pharmacological activity and knowledge of the common adverse
events. Given the inconsistency and misrepresentation of cannabis
in the marketplace in general, including in Canada, new metered dosing
modalities would be welcomed by healthcare practitioners and patients.
The comprehensive chemical analyses such as those presented in the
current investigation, including the chemical profiling of activation
of phytocannabinoids and other chemical transformations in various
medical cannabis strain would help facilitate the adoption of medical
cannabis extract-based products by the wider medical community.

Experimental Section
General
Dried cannabis (50 g) was
obtained from a Canadian
licensed producer in a commercial package, and this supply was used
for all of the experiments. Supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) was
performed on a Jasco SFE/SFC system consisting of a fluid delivery
module (CO2 pump and two solvent pumps), photodiode array
detector (PDA), column oven, autosampler, fraction collector, and
an automated back-pressure regulator. Decarboxylation of the phytocannabinoids
in the cannabis extract was performed by heating it in a microwave
reactor. Carbon dioxide (SFE grade) was obtained from Praxair. Cerilliant
standards for CBD and Δ9-THC were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich as Certified Reference Standards. All of the samples
were analyzed in triplicate, and triple deuterated Δ9-THC was used as an internal standard. Water (Milli-Q) and methanol
(HPLC grade) were used in chromatography. All of the other solvents
were reagent grade and used as such without further purification.

Extraction
Dried cannabis (1.0 g) was macerated and
transferred to an SFE extraction vessel. This vessel was placed in
the extraction column in the SFE and subjected to extraction with
supercritical CO2 (solvent A) and ethanol (solvent B).
The PDA detector was set in the rage of 200–600 nm and the
back-pressure regulator was set to 12 MPa. The SFE conditions are
as follows: flow rate = 10 mL/min (CO2 and slave pumps)
and 1 mL/min (make-up pump); temperature = 25 °C; gradient conditions:
100–50% solvent A and 0–50% solvent B from 0 →
25 min. The extraction was performed in two additional cycles on the
sample, and all of the fractions were combined to afford 277 mg of
a green, sticky resin.

Decarboxylation
Decarboxylation
of phytocannabinoid
carboxylic acids was conducted by subjecting the cannabis extract
to high temperature. A 5 mL size vial was charged with cannabis extract
(27.7 mg) suspended in ethanol (2 mL). The vial was sealed and subjected
to microwave irradiation for 10 min at 140–170 °C. This
was concentrated to dryness at 35 °C to obtain the activated
(decarboxylated) cannabis extract as a resin (21.2 mg).31

UPLC–MS Analyses
Cannabis
extracts were analyzed
on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC H-Class System equipped with Quaternary Solvent
Manager, Sample Manager FTN, and Acquity UPLC BEH column (2.1 ×
50 mm2, C18, 1.7 μm particle size). The injection
plate and the column were maintained at 15 and 40 °C, respectively.
The sample injection volume was 2 μL, and the flow rate was
0.6 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% HCOOH/H2O) and solvent B (0.1% HCOOH/MeOH), and a gradient between
the two phases was established as follows: an initial gradient of
30% solvent A/70% solvent B to 100% solvent B from 0 to 4.5 min, 100%
solvent B from 4.5 to 5 min, change to 70% of B from 5 to 5.2 min
and then continued at 30% solvent A/70% solvent B till the end of
the run at 6 min. A Waters MS3100 mass spectrometer was used as the
detector and set to the m/z range
of 60–2000 Da. Unique mass spectral signals were identified
by comparing the mass spectrum for the blank solution and that for
the resin solution.
