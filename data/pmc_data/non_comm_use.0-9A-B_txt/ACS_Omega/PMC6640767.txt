Porous BiOBr/Bi2MoO6 (Br/Mo) heterostructures
were designed and successfully fabricated, in which BiOBr nanoparticles
were deposited on the surface of the secondary nanoplate of three-dimensional
porous Bi2MoO6 architectures through a deposition–precipitation
process. The as-prepared Br/Mo heterostructures were used as an adsorbent
to remove methylene blue (MB) from aqueous solution. The batch adsorption
results indicated that 50.0 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures show an enhanced
adsorption capacity compared with pure Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr. The effects of initial solution, initial concentration,
and contact time were systematically investigated. The optimum adsorbent
amount and the pH value were determined to be 0.8 g L–1 and 2, respectively. Meanwhile, the experiments also revealed that
porous Br/Mo heterostructures possess higher preferential adsorptivity
for MB than that for methyl orange (MO–) and rhodamine
B (RhB+). The dynamic experimental result indicated that
the adsorption process conforms to the pseudo-second-order kinetic
model. Weber’s intraparticle diffusion model indicated that
two steps took place during the adsorption process. Thermodynamic
analysis results showed that the adsorption is a physisorption process,
which conforms to the Langmuir isotherm model. Additionally, the possible
adsorption mechanism was also investigated. The present study implied
that Br/Mo heterostructures are promising candidates as adsorbents
for MB removal. Therefore, fabrication of semiconductor-based heterostructures
could be a strategy to design new efficient adsorbents for the removal
of environmental pollutants.

1 Introduction
Organic
dyes have been extensively used in various industries,
including the dyestuff, leather, cosmetic, and textile industries.1,2 Until now, treatment of dye wastewater has been difficult due to
its high stability and complicated compositions.3 Most of these dyes may have potential carcinogenic and
mutagenic effects to humans and aquatic organisms.4,5 Therefore,
the removal of organic dyes from wastewater is of great significance
to the environmental safety.6−9 To date, a lot of techniques have been developed
for removing dyes from aqueous media, such as photocatalytic degradation,
chemical oxidation, chemical precipitation, biodegradation, coagulation,
and adsorption.10−13 Among the numerous methods, adsorption is a simple, low-cost and
effective method.6,14,15 In this regard, the well-known adsorbents, such as activated carbon,
natural materials, agricultural waste materials, and so forth, have
been widely studied.16,17 However, most of these adsorbents
are not widely used due to their high cost, difficult disposal, and
low adsorption efficiency. Recently, much attention has been paid
to nanomaterial adsorbents, because it is possible to construct them
with controllable sizes, morphologies, and functional surface groups.18,19

Recently, BiOBr has been widely used to degrade toxic organic
pollutants
owing to its special layered structure,20,21 high photocatalytic
activity,22−24 good chemical stability, and eco-friendly nature.25−27 In addition, the special layered structure endows BiOBr with good
performance for separation of photogenerated electron/hole pairs.28,29 To date, many groups have devoted efforts
toward studying the use of BiOBr as a photocatalyst and an adsorbent
for the adsorption of organic dyes and heavy metal ions.30−34 According to previous investigations, the adsorption ability of
BiOBr is vital to treat wastewater.35 Therefore,
it is highly desirable to explore new BiOBr-based materials with enhanced
adsorption abilities.

Bi2MoO6 is a layered
Aurivillius-related n-type
semiconductor with a small band gap (2.5–2.8 eV); therefore,
it is a promising photocatalyst.36−40 However, to our knowledge, studies on the adsorption
properties of Bi2MoO6 for organic pollutant
removal have not been reported. It is believed that BiOBr particles
decorated on the surface of a Bi2MoO6 heterostructure
to form a novel heterostructure will be an excellent adsorbent by
utilizing the merits of BiOBr and Bi2MoO6.

In this work, porous BiOBr/Bi2MoO6 (Br/Mo)
heterostructures have been successfully fabricated via a facile deposition–precipitation
process. The Br/Mo heterostructure presents a hierarchical structure
with a relatively high specific surface area to adsorb organic dyes
and exhibits improved adsorption efficiency than pure BiOBr and Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the kinetics and thermodynamics
of the adsorption process were investigated. Moreover, on the basis
of the experimental results, the enhanced adsorption mechanism of
Br/Mo heterostructures was also discussed. The experimental result
reveals that the as-fabricated Br/Mo heterostructures could be a high-efficiency
adsorbent for the removal of MB from aqueous solution.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of BiOBr/Bi2MoO6 Heterostructures
Synthetic details
of the porous
BiOBr/Bi2MoO6 heterostructures are provided
in the Supporting Information. The Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of pure BiOBr, Bi2MoO6, and Br/Mo heterostructures are presented in Figure 1. The band at 1630 cm–1 in the spectrum of BiOBr corresponds to the bending vibrations of
O–H,41 which is ascribed to the
water adsorbed. The absorption band at 510 cm–1 is
ascribed to the Bi–O stretching mode.42 For the Bi2MoO6 sample, peaks at 3443 and
1636 cm–1 are ascribed to O–H vibrations.43 The absorption bands at 910–650 and 630–430
cm–1 are assigned to Mo–O stretching vibrations
and Bi–O stretching and deformation vibrations,44 respectively. The peak located at 734 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibrations
of the equatorial oxygen atoms of MoO6, whereas the peak
at 567 cm–1 corresponds to the bending vibration
of the MoO6 octahedron.45 The
FT-IR results indicate that the heterostructures contain two fundamental
components, BiOBr and Bi2MoO6, and that no appreciable
chemical reaction occurred between BiOBr and Bi2MoO6.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of the as-synthesized samples of BiOBr, Bi2MoO6, and 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructure.

Figure 2 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pure BiOBr, Bi2MoO6, and 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures. As shown in Figure 2, all of the characteristic
diffraction peaks of the Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr samples
are assigned to the orthorhombic phase of Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS card no. 76-2388) and the tetragonal phase of BiOBr (JCPDS
card no. 09-0393), respectively. For
the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures, all of the BiOBr diffraction peaks
correspond to Br/Mo heterostructures. The XRD analysis indicates the
coexistence of BiOBr and Bi2MoO6 phases in the
as-prepared Br/Mo heterostructures, and no other new phases are observed.
The characteristic peaks of BiOBr at 25.156° can be found at
Br/Mo heterostructures. The XRD patterns of other Br/Mo heterostructures
with the different mass ratios are listed in Figure S1. It can be seen that the diffraction peak intensities of
BiOBr become stronger with an increase in BiOBr content, whereas the
characteristic peaks of Bi2MoO6 decrease in
intensity. The XRD result is consistent with the FT-IR analysis.

of Bi2MoO6 (a), 50 wt % Br/Mo
heterostructure (b), and pure BiOBr (c).

To further investigate the chemical composition of the composites,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures
was carried out. The XPS survey spectrum (Figure 3a) clearly indicates that 50 wt % Br/Mo is
composed of Bi, O, Br, Mo, and C elements. The C 1s peak in the spectrum
of Bi2MoO6 originates from adventitious carbon.46Figure 3b–e shows the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Bi 4f,
Mo 4f, Br 3d, O 1s, and C 1s regions, respectively. In Figure 3b, two peaks with binding
energies of 159.0 and 164.4 eV are assigned to Bi 4f 5/2 and Bi 4f
7/2, respectively, which correspond to Bi3+.47 In Figure 3c, the peak with binding energy at 68.89 eV is assigned
to Br in the Br/Mo heterostructure.48 Peaks
at 235.44 and 232.29 eV, as shown in Figure 3d, corresponding to Mo 4f 5/2 and Mo 4f 7/2,
respectively, can be assigned to the Mo6+ species in the
MoO6 octahedron.49Figure 3e shows that two
different oxygen species are present on the surface of the Br/Mo heterostructures.
The binding energy of O 1s located at 529.8 eV is attributed to the
lattice oxygen, whereas the O 1s peak situated at 531.8 eV should
be attributed to the hydroxyl groups adhered onto the surface of Br/Mo
heterostructures.48 These results are consistent
with the result of FT-IR analysis. Hence, the XPS result further confirmed
that the Br/Mo heterostructures have been fabricated. Therefore, using
a combination of FT-IR, XPS, and XRD investigations, we can deduce
that both Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr species are present
in the Br/Mo sample.

(f) C 1s.

The morphology of the Br/Mo heterostructures
was investigated by
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), as shown in Figure 4. It can be seen
from Figure 4 that
pure Bi2MoO6 exhibits three-dimensional (3D)
sphere-like Bi2MoO6 architectures with a size
of 1–2 μm (Figure 4a). Interestingly, the 3D Bi2MoO6 microsphere
consists of numerous secondary nanoplates with a thickness of 20–50
nm (Figure 4b). Figure 4c–d shows
the morphology of 50 wt % Br/Mo, and it can be seen that when BiOBr
is deposited on the surface of the 3D Bi2MoO6 architectures, the resultant Br/Mo composite sample exhibits similar
morphology and size to those of pure Bi2MoO6. With increasing BiOBr content, the morphology of the as-fabricated
Br/Mo heterostructures is similar to that of the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructure
(Figure S2). Further information of Br/Mo
heterostructures was obtained from transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images (Figure 5). It can be seen that pure Bi2MoO6 architectures consist of a massive Bi2MoO6 nanoplate (Figure 5a,b). From Figure 5c, it is clear that BiOBr nanoparticles are loaded
on the surface of the Bi2MoO6 nanoplate. By
carefully measuring the lattice parameters, the (111) plane of Bi2MoO6 and the (101) crystallographic plane of BiOBr
can be found clearly. In addition, a selected-area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern clearly shows that the Br/Mo heterostructure has polycrystalline
subunits, which indicates that Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr
have coupled together to form the heterostructure (Figure 5d). Furthermore, the energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) analysis demonstrated that Bi, Mo, O, and Br elements
existed in the Br/Mo heterostructures (Figure S3). The molar weight ratio of BiOBr to Bi2MoO6 obtained from the EDS analysis was also close to the theoretically
calculated value of Br/Mo heterostructures (Table S1). Therefore, the XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM investigation results
confirmed that both Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr species
are there in the Br/Mo heterostructure.

wt % Br/Mo heterostructure (c, d).

To investigate the porous structure
of the Br/Mo heterostructure,
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the corresponding
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution
plots of the as-fabricated samples were obtained. The BET specific
surface areas of the prepared BiOBr, Bi2MoO6, 12.5 wt % Br/Mo, 25 wt % Br/Mo, 50 wt % Br/Mo, and 100 wt % Br/Mo
are 31.04, 50.78, 64.94, 55.43, 55.57, and 49.62 m2 g–1, respectively (Figure S4 and Table S2). As shown in Figure 6, the pore size distribution curves for the as-synthesized
50 wt % Br/Mo were obtained by the BJH method (the inset picture of Figure 6). The calculated
pore size distribution using the BJH method indicates that the size
of mesopores in Br/Mo heterostructures is not uniform, ranging from
2 to 100 nm. Furthermore, the size of mesopores in Br/Mo heterostructures
is much higher than that of pure Bi2MoO6 and
BiOBr (Table S2). The abundantly porous
structure can facilitate more efficient contact of Br/Mo heterostructures
with organic contaminants and thus improve their adsorptive performances.
Because of the hysteresis loop and the small mesopores predominant
in the pore size distribution of Br/Mo, it is very reasonably expected
that Br/Mo has the potential for high adsorptive removal of organic
dyes.

2.2 Adsorption
Properties of Br/Mo Heterostructures
2.2.1 Effect
of Initial pH on the Adsorption Efficiency
Figure 7 shows adsorption
capacities for MB adsorption onto the surface of Br/Mo heterostructures.
It can be seen that a negligible amount of MB is adsorbed on the surface
of pure BiOBr. In Br/Mo heterostructures, the adsorption capacity
of MB improves with increasing content of BiOBr and reaches a maximum
value for the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures (Figure 7b). The dye removal efficiencies of the 50
wt % Br/Mo heterostructures, Bi2MoO6 nanostructures,
and BiOBr are 72.21, 30.04, and 18.39%, respectively, which may be
attributed to their novel heterostructures, abundant porous structure,
and relatively large BET specific surface area (Figure S2). Therefore, a synergistic effect may exist between
Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr during MB adsorption. Similar
effects have been reported for BiPO4/BiOBr,50 Cu2O/BiOBr,51 g-C3N4/BiOBr, and BiOBr/BiOI heterostructures.52 MB+ adsorption on the Br/Mo heterostructures
reaches equilibrium after about 60 min, which is significantly higher
than that for some other adsorbents.53,54

Figure 7 (a) Effect
of Br/Mo heterostructures with different weight ratios
on MB adsorption onto Br/Mo microspheres (1: BiOBr, 2: Bi2MoO6, 3: 12.5 wt % Br/Mo, 4: 25 wt % Br/Mo, 5: 50 wt %
Br/Mo, 6: 100 wt % Br/Mo); (b) UV–vis absorption spectra of
MB+ after being adsorbed for 120 min with the initial concentration
of MB: 30 mg L–1; mass of adsorbent: 1.0 g L–1; temperature: 298 K, respectively.

The pH seriously affects the active sites of adsorbents
as well
as the dye speciation during the adsorption process.55−58 In addition, pH has a significant effect on the electrostatic charges
that are imparted by the ionized dye molecules between the adsorbent
and adsorbate. The experiments were conducted with methylene blue
(MB+), methyl orange (MO–), and rhodamine
B (RhB+) with initial concentrations of 30 mg L–1 and 0.8 g L–1 of the Br/Mo heterostructure. As
shown in Figure 8,
the removal amount of MB+, MO–, and RhB+ was highly dependent on the pH of the solution. The pH of
the solution affected the surface charge of the Br/Mo heterostructures
and the degree of ionization of the dyes. For cationic dyes MB+ and RhB+, with an increase in the initial pH,
the removal capacities decreased drastically. When the initial pH
of the MB+ solution was 2, the removal efficiencies of
MB+ and RhB+ reached up to 98.94 and 98.42%,
respectively. The maximum adsorption of MB+ and RhB+ at the initial pH of 2 was due to the electrostatic attraction
between the positive charge of the protonated MB+ and RhB+ and the negative surface of the Br/Mo heterostructure. However,
a different situation was observed for the anionic dye MO–. The maximum removal efficiency of MO– was 77.95%,
observed at pH 4. The results could also be well explained by electrostatic
interactions between the dye molecule and adsorbent. The maximum adsorption
of MO– at pH 4 was due to the electrostatic attraction
between the negatively charged deprotonated MO– dye
and the positively charged surface of the Br/Mo heterostructures,
whereas the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged
surface and MO– anionic dye molecules increased
with an increase in solution pH, thus decreasing the adsorption capacity.

of initial pH on the adsorption of different dyes onto
the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures. Removal and temporal evolution
of UV–vis absorption spectra of MB+ (a, b), MO– (c, d), and RhB+ (e, f).

To investigate the surface charge of the adsorbent,
the zero charge
(pHPZC) of the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures was tested
and added as Figure S5. Generally speaking,
the influence of the solution pH on dye adsorption can be explained
on the basis of the pH at point zero charge (pHPZC) of
the adsorbent. The pHPZC value of 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures
determined by the solid addition method was about ca. 2.23 and ca.
5.37 (Figure S5). Hence, the net charge
of the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures is positive at pH 2 and 4. However,
Bi2MoO6 is a layered oxide, consisting of [Bi2O2]2+ layers sandwiched between [MoO4]2– slabs. Hence, it exhibits both negative
and positive surfaces, which results in its ability to adsorb MB+/RhB+ and MO–. Although
the net charge of the 50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures is positive at
pH 2 and 4, the merit structure endows Br/Mo heterostructures with
superior adsorption capacity for MB+/RhB+ and
MO– in acidic solutions. From the above results,
it is suggested that the Br/Mo heterostructure can be a high-efficiency
adsorbent for the adsorption of MB+, MO–, and RhB+, and acidic solutions are beneficial for dye
adsorption.

On the other hand, the charge and size of the dye
affect the adsorption
efficiency.59 So, we have chosen three
kinds of organic dyes for this study: MB+, MO–, and RhB+. The geometrical optimization of the dyes was
carried out by using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G(d,p) basis
sets. The measured dimensions of the organic dye molecules from the
calculation are shown in Table S3. Firstly,
MB+ and MO– were chosen to investigate
the charge effect due to their similar size but different charges
(Table S3). As shown in Figure 9a, the absorption peak decreased
gradually and the color faded to become transparent (the inset picture
in the upper part of Figure 9a), suggesting that nearly all of the MB+ were
adsorbed by the Br/Mo heterostructures. Then, a MB+/MO– mixture solution was chosen to investigate the charge
effect on the adsorption efficiency. The results indicated that more
than 90% of MB+ were adsorbed in 120 min, whereas less
than 40% of MO– were adsorbed (Figure 9b,c,f). This revealed that
the Br/Mo heterostructures adsorbed MB+ more efficiently
than MO– (Figure 9b,c,f). Secondly, MB+ and RhB+ with the same charges but different molecular sizes were chosen
to further investigate the size effect on the adsorption efficiency
(Table S3). For the smaller sized MB+, the characteristic absorption peak at 664 nm decreased sharply
in the MB+/RhB+ mixture solution. However, for
the larger sized RhB+, the characteristic absorption peak
at 553 nm decreased only slightly (Figure 9d). The molecular dimensions of the MB+ dye are 4.00 and 7.93 Å along the x and y directions, respectively, which are much
smaller than the diameter of the channel of Br/Mo heterostructures.
Thus, MB+ can enter the channel of Br/Mo heterostructures.
For RhB+ molecules, the dimensions along the x and y directions are 10.89 and 15.72 Å, respectively,
and they are much larger than the diameter of the channel of Br/Mo
heterostructures (Table S3). Hence, the
RhB+ molecule is too large to diffuse into the channel
of the Br/Mo heterostructures, and the adsorption efficiency is low.
Therefore, both size and charge of the dye molecule are responsible
for the selective adsorption efficiency of Br/Mo heterostructures.

at different pH values, (d, e) MB+/RhB+ mixture
solution at different pH values, and the removal ratio of MB+/MO– at different pH values (f).

2.2.2 Effect of Adsorbent Dosage
The
values of qe and the removal percentage
of dye (R%) at different dosages of Br/Mo heterostructures
are presented in Figure 10. As the Br/Mo concentration was increased from 0.3 to 0.8
g L–1, the percentage of adsorbed MB increased from
39.28 to 99.50%. The increase in the removal rate of dye was due to
the increased adsorbent surface area and the availability of more
adsorption sites.60 However, the adsorption
capacity (qe) presented the opposite trend
with a further increase in adsorbent concentration. The decrease in qe from 53.52 to 18.72 mg g–1 with increasing adsorbent concentration from 0.3 to 1.6 g L–1 was attributed to the adsorption competition among
adsorbents and the split in the concentration gradient.61 When the dosage of Br/Mo heterostructures was
0.8 g L–1, qe and R% were 37.33 mg g–1 and 99.50%, respectively. When
the concentration of the Br/Mo heterostructures was higher than 0.8
g L–1, the equilibrium adsorption (qe) inversely turned to be very low, which resulted as
the adsorption of MB reached equilibrium.62 When the dosage of the adsorbent was above 0.8 g L–1, there was no significant increase in the removal rate of MB, but qe decreased rapidly. Therefore, considering qe and R%, an adsorbent dose
of 0.8 g L–1 was determined as the optimum adsorbent
dosage, which was used in other studies.

Figure 10 Effect of adsorbent
dosage on the removal of MB (C0 = 30 mg
L–1; contact time: 120 min;
pH = 2; temperature: 298 K).

2.2.3 Effect of the Initial Concentration of MB
It can be seen from Figure 11 that the adsorption rate of MB+ onto the
Br/Mo heterostructures is enhanced rapidly during the initial stage
and is then reduced and reaches equilibrium after 80 min. During the
adsorption process, the dye molecules rapidly reach the boundary layer
by mass transfer, and then they slowly diffuse from the boundary layer
onto the adsorbent surface and finally diffuse into the porous structure
of the adsorbent.63Figure 11 also showed that the equilibrium adsorption
(qe) capacity increased from 37.23 to
58.85 mg g–1 with the initial concentration of MB
increasing from 30 to 70 mg L–1. When the initial
concentration of MB increased, the driving force for mass transfer
became larger and the interaction between MB and the adsorbent was
enhanced, which resulted in a higher adsorption capacity.64

Figure 11 Effects of contact time on the adsorption capacity of
MB onto the
50 wt % Br/Mo heterostructures at different initial concentrations
(C0 = 30, 50, and 70 mg L–1; adsorbent concentration = 0.8 g L–1; initial
pH = 2; temperature: 298 K; contact: 160 min).

2.3 Adsorption Kinetics
Generally speaking,
the adsorption mechanism depends on the characteristics of the adsorbent
and the mass transport process.65 To investigate
the adsorption mechanism of MB+ adsorbed onto Br/Mo heterostructures,
several adsorption kinetic models were employed (Table S4). The pseudo-first-order model of Lagergren is proportional
to the difference in the equilibrium adsorption capacity and the adsorbed
amount.66 The pseudo-second-order model
is based on the assumption that the rate-limiting step involves chemisorption.67Figure S6a,b shows
the kinetics for the adsorption of MB+ onto Br/Mo heterostructures.
As can be seen from Table 1, the correlation coefficients (R2) of the pseudo-second-order model were higher than 0.9999 for all
concentrations and the qe (qcal) values perfectly agreed with the experimental values
of qe,exp. However, the correlation coefficients
(R2) obtained from the pseudo-first-order
model were low for all concentrations and the qe,cal values were much lower than the qe,exp values. The result further indicated that the adsorption
of MB onto Br/Mo heterostructures followed the pseudo-second-order
model well.

model and pseudo-second-order model, respectively. k1, k2: rate constant according
to the pseudo-first-order model and pseudo-second-order model, respectively.

According to the pseudo-second-order
model, it is important to
investigate the rate-controlling step of the adsorption process.68 Hence, the intraparticle diffusion model is
employed to investigate the diffusion mechanism between MB+ molecules and Br/Mo heterostructures, and the kinetic model is given
by eq 3 (Table S4),69,70 where ki (mg g–1 min–1/2) is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and c (mg g–1) is the intercept. The value
of c is related to the thickness of the boundary
layer. Figure S6c reveals that two steps
have taken place during the adsorption process. As shown in Figure S6c, the ki value of the film diffusion stage is larger than that of the intraparticle
diffusion stage, indicating that the intraparticle diffusion stage
is a gradual process, which is consistent with Weber’s intraparticle
diffusion model (Table 2). Moreover, as seen from Figure S6c,
the plot does not pass through the origin, indicating that the intraparticle
diffusion is not the rate-controlling step.71,72 The high c values indicate that external mass transfer
is significant in the adsorption process. Furthermore, R12 and R22 of the two stages imply the good applicability of Weber’s
intraparticle diffusion model in studying the MB adsorption process.

2.4 Adsorption
Isotherm
For solid–liquid
adsorption, the adsorption isotherm is significant for understanding
the adsorption behavior. In the present study, both Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm models were employed to simulate the experimental data.71,73 The models can be described in the linear form, as listed in Table S5, and the isotherms are shown in Figure S7. KL, q0, KF, and n can be determined from these two isotherms, and the results
are displayed in Table 3. The results indicated that the adsorption capacity calculated from
the Langmuir isotherm is 54.82 mg g–1, which is
similar to the experimental result (55.36 mg g–1). Besides, R2 of the Langmuir model
is much larger than that of the Freundlich model. Hence, it is suggested
that the adsorption of MB onto Br/Mo heterostructures follows the
Langmuir model. In addition, the Temkin, Khan, Redlich-Peterson, and
Sips isotherm models were also employed to simulate the experimental
data. Parameters obtained
using the four isotherm models are listed in Table S6. As seen in Tables 3 and S6, the Langmuir isotherm
model fits the experimental data better than the Freundlich model
and the other isotherm models, as evidenced by the correlation coefficients
(R2). When the three-parameter isotherm
is used to simulate the experimental data, such as the Khan, Redlich-Peterson,
and Sips isotherm models, the correlation coefficient (R2) is close to that of the Langmuir isotherm model, which
further demonstrates that the MB adsorption onto Br/Mo heterostructures
follows the Langmuir model well.74,75

2.5 Thermodynamic Studies of
Adsorption
Thermodynamic parameters were estimated to describe
the effect of
temperature on MB adsorption onto Br/Mo heterostructures and to provide
insight into the adsorption mechanism. They were determined by van’t
Hoff equations76 1   2  where KL is the
Langmuir equilibrium constant (L mg–1) and R (8.314 J K–1 mol–1) represents the gas constant. The entropy change (ΔS°) and enthalpy change (ΔH°)
are determined from the intercept and slope of the van’t Hoff
plots of In (KL) versus 1/T (Figure S8). The thermodynamic parameters
are shown in Table 4. The negative values of Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) (−11.99, −13.25, −13.96, and
−14.92 kJ mol–1 at 298, 303, 308, and 318
K, respectively) confirm the spontaneous nature of the adsorption
process. Besides, the decrease in ΔG°
with an increase in temperature suggests that the adsorption is more
favorable at higher temperatures. The value of ΔH° (21.58 kJ mol–1) indicates that MB adsorption
onto Br/Mo heterostructures is a physisorption process and that the
adsorption process is endothermic.77,78 Meanwhile,
the positive value of ΔS° (115.05 J mol–1 K–1) illustrates the structural
changes in the adsorbate and the increasing randomness at the solid–solution
interface during fixation of MB onto the active sites of the Br/Mo
heterostructures.79

of MB onto Br/Mo Heterostructures

298	–11.99	21.58	115.05	
303	–13.25	
308	–13.96	
318	–14.92	
2.6 Adsorption Mechanism
To further verify
the adsorption mechanism of the dye on the surface of Br/Mo heterostructures,
the FT-IR spectra of Br/Mo, MB+, and MB-adsorbed Br/Mo
heterostructures (Br/Mo-MB) were also investigated (Figure S9). It can be seen that the FT-IR spectrum of Br/Mo
slightly changed after the adsorption of MB in comparison to Br/Mo
heterostructures. The absorption bands of Br/Mo heterostructures at
567 and 835 cm–1, corresponding to Bi–O and
Mo–O, shift slightly to 549 and 843 cm–1,
respectively, indicating that Bi–O and Mo–O of Br/Mo
heterostructures play an important role in the adsorption process,
whereas after adsorption on the surface of Br/Mo heterostructures,
the absorption bands of MB at 1858, 1389, and 1319 cm–1 shift slightly to 1608, 1391, and 1322 cm–1, respectively.
These changes can be attributed to the following facts. First, the
negatively charged surfaces of the Br/Mo heterostructures can provide
adsorption sites for electrostatic interaction with MB+. Second, the porous Br/Mo heterostructures possess a regular hierarchical
structure, a relatively high specific surface area, and an abundant
pore structure, which can facilitate efficient contact of MB molecules
with Br/Mo heterostructures.80,81 These above-mentioned
aspects synergistically contribute to the high adsorption capacity
and removal efficiency of Br/Mo heterostructures for MB. The possible
adsorption mechanism is schematically illustrated in Figure S10.

In addition, the stability of the 50 wt
% Br/Mo heterostructure was also investigated to demonstrate its potential
performance. After adsorption of MB+, the 50 wt % Br/Mo
adsorbent was collected by centrifugation, washed with 0.4 mol L–1 NaOH to remove the adsorbed MB+, and finally
dried at 70 °C in air for another cycle. As
shown in Figure S11, the 50 wt % Br/Mo
heterostructure did not exhibit slight loss of adsorption activity
even after five cycles.

The equilibrium adsorption capacity
of Br/Mo heterostructures at
25 °C was 55.36 mg g–1, which was larger than
that of the reported adsorbents, such as Cu2Cl(OH)3 microspheres,82 chitosan/kaolin/Fe2O3,83 Y-Fe2O3/SiO2/chitosan composites,84 and other adsorbents (Table S7). The present study implied that the Br/Mo heterostructure is a
promising candidate as a low-cost adsorbent for MB dye removal.

3 Conclusions
Br/Mo heterostructures have been
successfully fabricated via a
facile in situ deposition–precipitation process. The experimental
results indicated that the as-fabricated Br/Mo heterostructures exhibit
enhanced adsorption performance for MB with respect to pure Bi2MoO6 and BiOBr, which we ascribed to the electrostatic
interactions and structural properties of Br/Mo heterostructures.
Adsorption of MB onto Br/Mo heterostructures followed a pseudo-second-order
model, and the intraparticle diffusion was not the rate-limiting step.
The selective adsorption of MB onto Br/Mo heterostructures followed
the Langmuir isotherm. MB adsorption onto Br/Mo heterostructures was
found to be spontaneous and endothermic. Br/Mo heterostructures could
potentially become a new class of adsorbents for removal of organic
dyes from wastewater.
