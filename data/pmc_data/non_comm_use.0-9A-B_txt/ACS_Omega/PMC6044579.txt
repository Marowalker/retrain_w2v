Self-labeled inhibitors (SLIs) are
promising for creating links,
ranging from cancer therapy and metastatic pathways to mechanistic
elucidation. In this study, a new category of “two-in-one”
fluorescent xanthone inhibitors was developed for the systematic evaluation
of anticancer activity and the selective imaging of cytoplasm in vitro.
These xanthone inhibitors presented high fluorescent brightness, working
over a wide pH range enabled by a “switchable reaction”
of the heterocyclic backbone. The strength and nature of fluorescence
were probed via spectroscopic methods and density functional theory
calculations on the molecular level, respectively. Along with the
potent anticancer activity, which was demonstrated using MTT and clonogenic
assays with high fluorescent brightness in the cytoplasm, SLI 3fd could be established as a modeled self-monitoring drug
in cancer therapy.

Introduction
Enabled by the advancement
of fluorescent spectroscopic and microscopic
technologies, monitoring the real-time behavior of drug molecules
inside of living cells has been well-established.1 Traditionally, tracking drug molecules and their corresponding
behavior (e.g., the alternation of the molecular structure and informational
feedback) was dependent on the output of signals from the fluorescent
label attached to the drug molecules.2−5 However, extraneous fluorescent labels or
drug delivery media could pose potential risks such as toxicity, residue,
and metabolism, which would interfere with the normal cellular function.6 Therefore, it is highly desired to design self-labeled
inhibitors (SLIs) that not only play the role of antagonists but also
report their own trace in cells and further potentially convey the
information of intracellular delivery, metastatic pathways, and even
mechanistic elucidation (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Functionalized SLIs.

Xanthones represent a valuable category of natural products7−12 because of their prominent pharmacological activities. They are
known to serve as inhibitors for various targets such as tumors,13,14 bacteria,15,16 viruses,17 fungi,18 and others.19−21 Recently, the
fluorescence of xanthones has been investigated for selective labeling
and recognition of multiscale chemical or biological species.22,23 For example, Maity et al. developed a two-photon probe based on
the xanthone framework for the selective detection of Cu+ in a physiologically reducing environment;24 Umemoto et al. used a series of xanthone and thioxanthone derivatives
to study the binding process of small molecules to RNA;25 and Gosh et al. used acetylated xanthones to
serve as fluorescent probes for embryonic stem cells.26 However, to the best of our knowledge, no information is
available about an SLI that couples at least two functions, viz.,
antagonism and fluorescence in one xanthone molecule, to inhibit cancer
cells, track drug delivery, and report the response of intracellular
homeostasis.

Given these considerations, we envisioned that
an SLI model can
be established based on a rational design, stepwise screening, and
functional combination. Herein, we report a sequential approach to
discover, characterize, and evaluate “two-in-one” fluorescent
inhibitors, which includes three stages: (i) xanthone derivatives
(3) were initially screened using fluorescent calorimetry,
after which the strength and nature of fluorescence were meticulously
probed using spectroscopic methods and density functional theory (DFT)
calculations; (ii) the screened fluorescent molecules and quenched
counterparts were subjected to MTT and clonogenic assays that shed
light on the anticancer activity both in the short- and long-term;
and (iii) in order to demonstrate the self-monitoring in cancer cells,
the potent inhibitor 3fd was investigated using cell
imaging to observe the subcellular localization.

Results and Discussion
In the first stage, synthetic efforts have been made to establish
xanthone-based fluorescent compounds (3) (Figure 2a). The remarkable tolerance
of the functional groups (R1 and R2) enabled
the facile transfer of electrons across the π-conjugated fused
rings, and different-sized diazaheterocycles (n)
modulated the flexibility of the molecular skeleton. Accordingly,
the rational preintroduction of electron withdrawing or donating groups
in synthons 1 and 2 should tremendously
affect the fluorescent performance of 3. Once the xanthone-based
compounds (3) have been constructed, first-stage screening
was carried out (Table S1). After rigorous
calorimetry, six molecules (Figure 2b) with the highest fluorescent intensity were selected
as candidates for the development of SLIs.

Figure 2 (a) Synthesis of xanthone-based
compounds; (b) candidates with
the highest light-emitting intensity; and (c) accidental discovery
of the pH-tuned, switchable reaction-dependent fluorescent molecules.

For the sake of maximally dissolving
the target compounds 3 in the deuterated solvent, a drop
of perchloric acid was
added when the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization was
carried out. Unexpectedly, we found that with the disappearance of
fluorescence, all of the compounds (3) were transformed
into the ring-opened counterparts (3′) (Figure 2c). Moreover, this
accidental phenomenon encouraged us to tackle at least two important
questions, viz.: (i) is the transformation reversible? and (ii) how
can the essential relationship and the mechanism between the structural
and fluorescent changes be demonstrated and confirmed?

As a
result, an integrated investigation of fluorescent molecules 3ac–3ae and 3fc–3fe, which included
spectroscopic properties, NMR, X-ray crystallographic analysis, DFT
calculations, and electrochemistry was conducted. Ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption spectra (Figure 3a and Table 1, col. 2) and calculated electronic transitions (Table 1, col. 3) revealed
that shifting the substitution groups (R2) from a more
to a less electron-withdrawing state (F → Cl → Br) and
increasing the size (n) of diazaheterocycles (1 →
2) lead to a small but a discernible red shift. At the same time,
the fluorescence of these molecules was also examined. Several solvents
were used to probe the effects of increased polarity on the emission
wavelengths (λem) of 3ae (Figure S2). It was found that an apparent red
shift will occur when the polarity of the solvents increases. The
best excitation wavelengths (λex) and λem ranged from 449–470 to 519–526 nm (Figure 3b and Table 1, col. 4), respectively (Figures S3–S8). Importantly, the combination
of electron donors and acceptors in the xanthone framework released
most of its potential fluorescent properties, for example, large Stokes
shifts (∼80 nm) (Figure 3c and Table 1, col. 5), high quantum yields (up to 0.671), and excellent fluorescent
brightness (up to 74.72 mL mg–1 cm–1) (Table 1, col. 7).
Consequently, these molecules could avoid self-quenching and enhance
the number of labels that can be attached to a biological entity.

Having completed this preliminary
study of spectroscopic properties,
it is time to point out the proposed fluorescence mechanism. A combined
method has been adopted to confirm the reversibility of the transformation
illustrated in Figure 2c. When two drops of KOH solution were dropped into compounds 3′, the disappeared fluorescence of 3 reproduced
in 10 s. The contrasting in situ 13C and 1H
NMR spectra (for original data, see Supporting Information) between 3fd and 3fd′ revealed that once the transformation occurred, the chemical shifts
of C1 (H1), C2, C4 (H4), C5, C7, and C8 moved to a lower field, whereas
those of C3 and C6 moved to a higher field. The newly generated hydroxyl
group (H9) introduced a chemical shift at 9.57 ppm (Figure 4a). These alterations in the
characteristic peaks could partially verify that the transformation
is reversible. In addition, clear evidence from the X-ray crystallographic
interpretation of 3cb and 3cb′ solidified
the previous deduction (Figure 4b).

compounds 3fd and 3fd′ and (b) X-ray
crystal structures of compounds 3cb and 3cb′. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 30% probability.

To demonstrate the essential relationship between
the structural
and fluorescent changes, we next sought to use the DFT calculation
of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) to elucidate the mechanism of
fluorescence quenching (Figure 5). For all molecules 3, an excellent agreement
between the experimental and theoretical maximal absorptions or emissions
was observed (Table 1, col. 3). The main absorption bands were due to three excitations
with a high oscillator strength (f ≈ 0.40),
viz., HOMO → LUMO, HOMO – 1 → LUMO, and HOMO
→ LUMO + 1, mainly of the π → π* or n → π* intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
characteristic. The emission band with a high oscillator strength
(f ≈ 0.45), which was responsible for the
fluorescence, lay on the π* → π ICT of LUMO →
HOMO. It was obviously reflected in the population of the FMOs. For
the ring-opening counterparts 3′, a higher energy
(∼0.25 eV) needed to be supplied for the absorption, but the
oscillator strength (f ≈ 0.20) was only half
that of 3. In addition, once the rigid molecular framework
was broken, the emission band of 3′ (LUMO →
HOMO) shifted to the longer wavelength region (∼690 nm) with
an extremely small oscillator strength (f ≈
0.0002); meanwhile, the flexible structure restricted the ICT. On
the other hand, the electrostatic potential also offered apparent
evidence for the direction of electron mobility (Figure 6a). Therefore, the fluorescence
quenching was caused by the ICT block, which was derived from a twisted
ICT (TICT) via the rotation of C–C single bonds (C1–C2,
C2–C3, and C4–C5) (Figure 6a). Afterward, the electrochemical property
was also tested using cyclic voltammetry (Figure 6b). For instance, 3fd presented
only one reversible reduction potential. The first onset of reduction
was at −1.04 V, with a reversible reduction wave at −1.19
V. It was revealed that the molecules are electron-deficient and therefore
can be considered as electron acceptors.

Having illustrated the fluorescent nature of the
selected molecules,
we next performed a second-stage screening. The anticancer activity
in MTT and clonogenic assays was evaluated to identify the most promising
fluorescent inhibitors in several human cell lines. For compounds
that showed >50% inhibition, half-maximal inhibitory concentrations
(IC50) were determined. For short-term treatment effects
(Table 2), we found
that except for 3ac, all compounds presented definite
cytotoxicity to many cancer cell lines (IC50 < 50 μM).
In particular, compounds 3fe, 3fc′, and 3fd′ demonstrated potent anticancer activity,
with IC50 < 10 μM in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells.
It is also worth noting that the cytotoxicity of all molecules for
embryonic lung fibroblasts MRC-5 is lower than that for the positive
control cisplatin (DDP) (Table 2, entry 10), indicating that the screened inhibitors are effective against cancer cells (e.g.,
T47D and U251), yet have lower cytotoxicity to normal cells (e.g.,
MRC-5).

To investigate the long-term
treatment effects of inhibitors 3fd and 3fd′, a clonogenic assay was also
performed in HepG2 liver carcinoma cells. This assay is used to determine
the ability of a cell to proliferate indefinitely. IC50 values of 3fd and 3fd′ were estimated
by dividing the mean number of colonies following compound treatment
by the mean number of colonies in the absence of a compound. Compared
with untreated controls, the number of colonies declined after treatment
with a series of concentrations of 3fd and 3fd′ (Figure 7a), with
IC50 values of 5.99 and 5.55 μM (Figure 7b), respectively. In any case,
the perfect match for short-term (MTT assay) and long-term (clonogenic
assay) treatments showed stable and continued activities in cancerous
resistance.

Figure 7 (a) Clonogenic assay for long-term anticancer activity and (b)
colony-forming ratio of inhibitors 3fd and 3fd′.

In view of the above scenario,
the assembly of potent anticancer
activity with inherent high fluorescent brightness in an inhibitor
shows promise. Hence, we finally proposed a cell imaging program to
validate the feasibility of inhibitor 3fd through the
observation of the subcellular localization in HepG2 cells. The experiment
was carried out with increasing concentrations of 3fd and staining of the nucleus with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). The results demonstrated that the accumulation
of blue fluorescence in the nuclear compartment contrasts with the
extensive green fluorescent inhibitor 3fd sequestered
in the cytoplasm (Figure 8). Increasing the incubation concentration of 3fd does not change its subcellular localization. Therefore, 3fd is preferentially localized to the cytoplasm. So far, as an antagonist, 3fd has presented extraordinary potency in several cancer
cell lines; as a fluorescein, it has afforded extreme brightness;
most importantly, as a model SLI, it lights up the way to the cell,
reports where it is, and ultimately kills the cancerous enemy.

images of HepG2 cells incubated with fluorescent
inhibitor 3fd (green) or DAPI (blue).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
successfully developed the first model of an
SLI in cancer therapy via an assembly line pathway that includes the
systematic screening of fluorescent xanthone derivatives, the multidimensional
evaluation of anticancer activity, and the functional embedment of
the two inherent properties. The present results with SLI 3fd indicate that the fluorescent properties can avoid self-quenching
and enhance the number of labels; simultaneously, the coherent short-
and long-term resistance can ensure excellent anticancer activity.
Importantly, the functional combination reveals a promising idea for
tracking drug molecules on the micron scale. Moreover, with the tunable
fluorescent intensity over a wide pH range, it also provides a new
impetus for probing the effects of homeostasis to antagonism. It is
worth pointing out that the SLI concept suggests in-depth insights
into the informational feedback of intracellular delivery, metastatic
pathways, mechanistic elucidation, and so forth. Further investigations
into the quantitative pH-fluorescence response for cancer cells and
the real-time imaging of an enzymatic target on the nanoscale are
currently under way.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All commercially available reagents
were purchased from Adamas Reagent Co. Ltd. and used without further
purification unless otherwise stated. Melting points were determined
using a melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. 1H
(13C) NMR spectra were recorded at 500 (125) MHz using
CDCl3, DMSO-d6, or their combination
as the solvent. The chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in parts
per million relative to the residual deuterated solvent signal, and
coupling constants (J) are given in hertz. Infrared
(IR) spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometer using KBr pellets. High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) data were obtained in the electron impact (EI) mode at 70 eV.
Anhydrous ethanol was used throughout the process of absorption and
fluorescence determination. All samples were prepared at room temperature.
Dilute hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide was used for tuning the
pH values. UV–vis absorption spectra were obtained using 1.0
cm quartz cells. An ethanolic solution of compounds 3 (25 μg mL–1) was added to a 10 mL volumetric
flask. The ethanolic solution was equilibrated for 2 min before measurement.
The excitation slit was set to 5.0 nm. Fluorescent emission spectra
were obtained using a xenon lamp and 1.0 cm quartz cells. An ethanolic
solution of compounds 3 (25 μg mL–1) was added to a 10 mL volumetric flask. After dilution with different
buffer solutions, the mixture was equilibrated for 2 min before measurement.
The excitation and emission slits were set to 5.0 nm. The quantum
yields of compounds 3 in anhydrous ethanol were determined
by comparing the integrated fluorescence spectra of the samples with
that of a standard (rhodamine 6G in anhydrous ethanol, 5.0 μg
mL–1).

Computational Methods
All calculations
were carried
out using the Gaussian 03 program.27 Geometry
optimizations were performed with the B3LYP functional28−30 and the 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set31 for
the ground states. UV–vis absorptions (vertical excitation)
were calculated using the TD-DFT method based on the optimized ground
state geometry (GS, S0 state). For fluorescent emissions,
the light emission was calculated based on the optimized excited states
(ES, S1 state). The default self-consistent reaction field
(SCRF) PCM was used with ethanol (dielectric constant ε = 24.852)
as the solvent, while universal force field (UFF) radii were chosen
as the atomic radii to define the molecular cavity. Vibrational frequencies
were calculated for all stationary points to verify that each was
a minimum (no imaginary frequencies) on the potential energy surface.

Cyclic Voltammetry
CVs were recorded on a Zahner IM6e
electrochemical workstation using a Pt foil as the working electrode,
a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/AgCl electrode as the
reference. Cyclic voltammetry curves run at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 in anhydrous ethanol with 1.0 × 10–4 M substrate and 0.1 M [NBu4]+[PF6]− as the supporting electrolyte. Fc/Fc+ couple was used as an internal standard.

MTT Assay
Four
carcinoma cell lines and one normal
cell line, that is, diploid fibroblasts (MRC-5), liver carcinoma cells
(HepG2), colorectal cancer cells (HT29), gastric carcinoma cells (SCG7910),
and cancerous alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cells were
incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and humidified air.
The growth inhibition of human cancer cells by compounds 3 (3ac–3ae and 3fc–3fe) was
assessed using the MTT assay, along with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
as a control. Different human cancer cell lines were treated with
compounds at various concentrations. After a 96 h incubation, MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] was
added to the wells (50 mL; 0.4 mg mL–1) and incubated
for another 4 h. The medium was aspirated, and DMSO (150 mL) was added
to each well. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a 2030 Multilabel
Reader (Perkin-Elmer Victor X5, US). Compound concentrations causing
50% growth inhibition (IC50) were calculated.

Clonogenic Assay
Exponentially growing HepG2 cells
were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well
in 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight; then, the cells
were exposed to different concentrations of 3fd and 3fd′ (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 18 h, whereas
control wells received the vehicle alone. Afterward, the vehicle and
the compound-treated cells were replated into 6-well plates (700 cells/well)
in triplicate. The plates were incubated for 10 days at 37 °C
in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were washed [three
times in ice–cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS)], fixed with
prechilled methanol (20 min), stained with 0.5% methylene blue for
30 min, washed thoroughly in distilled H2O, and air-dried.
Cell colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. IC50 values of 3fd and 3fd′ were estimated
by dividing the mean number of colonies following compound treatment
by the mean number of colonies in the absence of the compound.

In Vitro
Cell Imaging
The HepG2 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well)
were incubated at 37 °C with different concentrations
of 3fd (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 μM) and treated for
15 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed with ice-cold
PBS before the fixation with fixative (5% paraformaldehyde/sucrose/PBS
= 6:1:3) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the cells
were incubated with DAPI (1 mg mL–1) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. A drop of antifade
solution was added, and the treated portion of the slide was covered
with a glass coverslip. The fluorescence of the compound was detected
and localized using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000) with a
100 oil objective. The optical sections were obtained in the Z axis and stored in the computer with a scanning mode.

Noncommercially Available Compounds
Heterocyclic ketene
aminals (HKAs) 1 were prepared according to a procedure
described in the literature.32 The identity
of the materials was confirmed using 1H and 13C NMR and by their spectra from mass spectrometry.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Compounds 3
HKAs (1) (1.0 mmol) and 3-formylchromones
(2) (1.0 mmol) were combined and dissolved in acetone
(15 mL), followed by the addition of trimethylamine (10 mol%). Subsequently,
the reaction mixture was stirred in a round-bottom flask (25 mL) at
room temperature for 15 min. After the completion of the reaction
as indicated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), the mixture was filtered
and washed with ethanol (3 × 5 mL). The crude solid was then
dried and recrystallized from acetone to afford the pure products 3.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 3′
One to eight drops of pure acid were dropped
into compounds 3 (0.5 mmol). Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was stirred
in a round-bottom flask (5 mL) for 8–25 seconds (s) (Scheme 1). After the completion
of the reaction as indicated by TLC, the mixture was filtered and
washed in succession with H2O (2 × 5 mL) and EtOH
(2 × 5 mL). The residue was then dried to afford the pure products 3′.

washed in succession with H2O (2 × 5 mL) and EtOH
(2 × 5 mL). The residue was then dried to afford the pure products 3.
