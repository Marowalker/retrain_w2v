An organolithium
addition–intramolecular α-amidoalkylation sequence on N-phenethylimides has been developed for the synthesis of
fused tetrahydroisoquinoline systems using 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol
(binol)-derived Brønsted acids. This transformation is the first
in which activated benzene derivatives are used as internal nucleophiles,
instead of electron-rich heteroaromatics, generating a quaternary
stereocenter. Phenolic substitution on the aromatic ring of the phenethylamino
moiety and the use of binol-derived N-triflylphosphoramides
as catalysts are determinants to achieve reasonable levels of enantioselection,
that is, up to 75% enantiomeric excess, in the α-amidoalkylation
step. The procedure is complementary to the intermolecular α-amidoalkylation
process, as opposite enantiomers are formed, and to the Pictet–Spengler
cyclization, which allows the formation of tertiary stereocenters.

Introduction
Small-molecule chiral
hydrogen-bond donors, such as ureas/thioureas1 and chiral Brønsted acids,2 are
useful and versatile catalysts for many asymmetric
transformations because of their ability to activate an electrophilic
substrate toward nucleophilic addition. In this context, the development
of bifunctional thiourea catalysts has pushed forward N-acyliminium ion chemistry,3 especially
the enantioselective catalytic variant of intramolecular α-amidoalkylation
reactions,3e,3f,4 which
are formally asymmetric organocatalytic intramolecular Friedel–Crafts
reactions.5 In 2004, Jacobsen6 demonstrated for the first time the ability of
these catalysts to activate an acyclic N-acyliminium
ion in the enantioselective acyl-Pictet–Spengler reaction7 for indole alkaloid synthesis. Subsequently,
the intramolecular α-amidoalkylation reaction of indole and
pyrrole-tethered α-hydroxylactams catalyzed by a chiral bifunctional
thiourea was reported.8 Reactivity patterns
in these reactions were found to be consistent with a first-order
nucleophilic substitution-type mechanism, involving the formation
of a chiral N-acyliminium/chloride thiourea anion
pair. This anion-binding concept in thiourea-catalyzed reactions has
also led to the development of related cascade reactions for the construction
of polycyclic frameworks.9 However, this
mode of activation failed when the N-phenylethylamine
counterparts, required for dihydropyrroloisoquinoline synthesis, were
used.8b As the reactivity of thioureas
is limited because of their weak acidity and therefore their activation
capacity, chiral Brønsted acids, in particular, sterically demanding
1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (binol)-derived chiral phosphoric acids
(CPAs), independently introduced in 2004 by Akiyama10 and Terada,11 have proven to
be highly efficient catalysts for Mannich-type and related reactions.
Key aspects for their success include their capacity to form stable
ion pairs, their bifunctional character, and the facile chiral modulation
of their backbone, very close to the acidic moiety.2,12 Several
research groups have demonstrated that CPAs could promote enantioselective
Pictet–Spengler cyclization reactions, providing β-carboline
derivatives in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities.13 Analogous Pictet–Spengler reactions via
sulfeniminium ion intermediates have become an effective means of
preparing not only enantiopure β-carbolines14 but also tetrahydroisoquinolines, with a tertiary stereocenter
at C-1.15 In the latter case, the substitution
pattern of the aromatic ring in the N-phenethylamine
starting material and the ancillary substituent on the nitrogen atom
are crucial for achieving good reactions. Iminium ion stabilization
by the sulfenyl substituent was proposed to favor Pictet–Spengler
cyclization over undesired enamine formation.14 However, the successful application of CPA catalysis to intramolecular
α-amidoalkylation reactions was again limited to the use of
electron-rich heteroaromatics (indoles and pyrroles) as internal nucleophiles.
Thus, Dixon reported a direct enantio- and diastereoselective N-acyliminium cyclization cascade through binol-derived
phosphoric acid-catalyzed condensation of tryptamines with enol lactones16 (or the corresponding γ- and δ-ketoacid
derivatives)17 to provide architecturally
complex β-carboline derivatives, with control of the stereochemistry
of up to two contiguous stereogenic centers. On the other hand, related
cascade reactions via cooperative transition metal/CPA catalysis have
also been designed for the synthesis of enantioenriched tetrahydro-β-carbolines
in a highly efficient manner.18

Despite
these breakthroughs in enantioselective N-acyliminium
ion cyclizations, their application for the construction
of optically active tetrahydroisoquinolines,19 which are important structural motifs in biologically active compounds,
still remains a major challenge. Tetrahydroisoquinolines, having a
stereocenter at the C-1 carbon, are important scaffolds widely distributed
in natural alkaloids and pharmaceuticals and are also commonly used
as key intermediates in organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry
(Figure 1).20 For example, phenolic pyrrolo[2,1-a]tetrahydroisoquinolines21 as (−)-trolline
show antibacterial activity against respiratory bacteria and antiviral
activity against influenza viruses A and B,22 whereas (+)-oleracein E exhibits potent antioxidant properties;23 thus, it may serve as a neuroprotectant in the
prevention and treatment of Parkinson’s disease.24 Alkaloids with the isoindolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline skeleton,25 such as natural
products hirsutine, jamtine, and nuevamine or the synthetic derivative
CRR-271, also display significant pharmacological activity, that is,
anti-inflammatory properties.26 Therefore,
significant attention remains focused on the development of new synthetic
methods for the asymmetric synthesis of these heterocycles.

compounds that contain fused tetrahydroisoquinoline
frameworks.

Our research group has
maintained an interest in the α-amidoalkylation
reactions of N-phenethylhydroxylactams in both the
inter- and intramolecular variants for the synthesis of tetrahydroisoquinoline
derivatives.27 In a preliminary communication,
we demonstrated that a sterically demanding CPA catalyzed the intramolecular
α-amidoalkylation of tertiary N-acyliminium
ions with the methoxylated benzene ring as internal π-nucleophiles
to give pyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinolines, with promising
enantioselectivity (up to 74%), but in low yield (23%), due to low
conversion.28 Therefore, we decided to
get further insight into the enantioselective intramolecular α-amidoalkylation
reaction of cyclic α-hydroxylactams derived from N-phenethylimides using chiral Brønsted acids as catalysts to
construct the tetrahydroisoquinoline framework of fused isoquinoline
derivatives generating a quaternary stereocenter (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Enantioselective
Synthetic Approaches to Isoquinoline Frameworks
Because binol-derived phosphoric acids could
not be reactive enough
for the activation of these challenging substrates, N-triflylphosphoramides (NTPAs) would also be used. The introduction
of the triflylamide into well-known CPAs leads to a significant decrease
in pKa and to the formation of tighter
ion pairs.29 On the other hand, a general
strategy for enhancing the reactivity of aromatic rings toward SEAr (including Pictet–Spengler and N-acyliminium ion cyclizations) involves the introduction of strong
electron-donating groups, in particular hydroxyl groups.15 Besides, in some cases the formation of a hydrogen
bond between the phenolic OH and the basic site of the CPA could be
crucial for the enantioselection.30 In
a related approach, we have also studied the enantioselective intramolecular
α-amidoalkylation with bicyclic α-hydroxylactams for the
preparation of 12b-substituted isoindoloisoquinolines using binol-derived
Brønsted acids. In these cases, hydrogen-bonding interactions
between the phosphate ion-paired intermediate and the N–H group
in the nucleophile (indoles31 or enamides32) were invoked to explain the stereochemical
outcome. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of the activation
of the aromatic rings (methoxyl vs hydroxyl substitutents) on the
reactivity and the enantioselectivity of intramolecular α-amidoalkylation
reactions of N-phenethylhydroxylactams using both
binol-derived phosphoric acids and N-triflamides
as catalysts. We disclose here the full details of our investigations
that had led to the synthesis of enantioenriched fused isoquinoline
derivatives, through the generation of tertiary and quaternary stereocenters.

Results
and Discussion
For this study, we selected succinimides 1 that had
previously given the best results in terms of enantioselectivity.28 In addition, we selected phthalimides 2, which would lead to the formation of 12b-substituted isoindolo[1,2-a]isoquinolines (Scheme 2). The addition of an organolithium to the imide would
afford the corresponding hydroxylactam, which upon treatment with
a chiral Brønsted acid would be transformed into an N-acyliminium ion, generating chiral ion pair I. The N-acyliminium ion would be trapped by the aromatic ring,
and the cyclization reaction would afford the corresponding fused
isoquinolines with a new stereocenter. As stated above, we have previously
developed the enantioselective synthesis of 12b-substituted isoindoloisoquinolines
through a Parham cyclization–Brønsted acid-catalyzed intermolecular
α-amidoalkylation sequence.31,32 If an analogous
working model to explain the stereochemical outcome is assumed,12b in this case, it would be expected that the
intramolecular attack of the aromatic ring would lead to the opposite
stereochemistry on the new stereogenic center. Thus, these strategies
would constitute enantiodivergent approaches to fused isoquinoline
alkaloids.

Scheme 2 Organolithium Addition/N-Acyliminium
Cyclization
Sequence
We started our study
using succinimides as substrates. In our preliminary
communication,28 we had reported that methyllithium
(MeLi) addition to N-phenethylsuccinimide 1a led to the corresponding N-phenethylhydroxylactam,
which could be cyclized to the corresponding fused isoquinoline upon
treatment with a Brønsted acid. Different CPAs and a wide range
of organic solvents were tested. The reaction yields improved significantly
upon using more polar solvents, although pyrroloisoquinoline 3a was obtained almost in racemic form in all cases. The use
of sterically congested acid 5d was a determinant to
obtain good levels of enantioselection, and up to 74% enantiomeric
excess (ee) could be obtained using 5d (20 mol %) in
toluene, although with a low yield (Scheme 3). In view of these results, we tested more
activated imides 1b and 1c. Addition of
MeLi under the standard conditions afforded the corresponding hydroxylactams,
whose purity was checked by 1H NMR to make sure that there
were no byproducts that could interfere in the subsequent cyclizations.
However, they were not further purified or fully characterized, as
hydroxylactams are not stable under chromatographic conditions and
may lead to dehydrated products or tautomeric ketoamides,27a so they were immediately subjected to cyclization
reactions. As expected, both hydroxylactams derived from imides 1b and 1c showed higher reactivity than that
of 1a, obtaining moderate yields in shorter reaction
times. However, when the best conditions reported for 1a were used (catalyst 5d in toluene), the yields of pyrroloisoquinolines
were moderate (59% for 3b in 16 h; 38% for 3c in 64 h), but no enantioselectivity was observed (8% ee for 3b, 7% ee for 3c). Phosphoric acid 5d promoted the cyclization in various solvents (tetrahydrofuran (THF),
CH2Cl2, dimethylformamide, CH3CN,
EtOH, and dioxane), even at room temperature (rt), obtaining moderate
to good yields but poor enantioselection (14% ee in CH2Cl2). The use of 5a–c or 5e did not improve the results (see Table S1 in the Supporting Information (SI)).
Thus, although the use of more activated rings enhanced the reactivity,
the enantioselectivity was lost.

Scheme 3 Cyclization of Succinimides 1a–c
In view of these poor results, we decided to test phthalimides 2, expecting that the corresponding hydroxylactams would be
more stable than those derived from succinimides 1, and
would also lead to more stable N-acyliminium intermediates,
which could interact more efficiently with the CPA, as has been shown
for related structures in the intermolecular version.31,32

First, the reduction of imide 2a was performed
to
test the N-acyliminium ion cyclization for the formation
of a tertiary stereocenter (Table 1). Indeed, cyclization of the corresponding hydroxylactam
afforded isoindoloisoquinoline 4a, in the presence of
catalyst 5a, in toluene and acetonitrile in moderate
yield but low enantioselectivity (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). High temperatures (reflux)
were required to carry out the reaction in reasonable reaction times
with catalyst 5a, as at rt only low conversions were
achieved (entries 3 and 4). Once again, the best results were attained
with catalyst 5d in toluene, obtaining a good yield and
the highest enantioselectivity (25% ee, entry 7). Thus, although the
reactivity was enhanced, efficient control of the enantioselectivity
could not be achieved with 5a–e.

We then studied the generation of a quaternary stereocenter.
Thus,
addition of MeLi to imides 2a–c in
THF at −78 °C gave the corresponding hydroxylactams that,
after workup, were treated with corresponding CPA 5 without
further purification. As shown in Table 2, the hydroxylactam derived from imide 2a did not cyclize when treated with 5a and 5c in refluxing toluene (Table 2, entries 1 and 2), and only the formation of the corresponding
enamide resulting from water elimination could be observed by 1H NMR. Reaction conditions were optimized using the more reactive
hydroxylactam derived from imide 2b. Acids 5b and 5c did not show any catalytic activity in toluene
(entries 5 and 6), and again 5d gave the best enantioselectivity
(entry 7), although still low. Very low reactivity was shown at rt
(entry 4). With more polar solvents, the reactivity was enhanced,
obtaining good yields in shorter reaction times (entries 9 and 10),
but with no enantioselection. An increase of the steric bulk on the N-acyliminium intermediate (R4 = n-Bu, t-Bu) precluded cyclizations (entries 11 and
12). Hydroxylactam derived from imide 2c was not reactive
in toluene and gave similar low enantioselectivities in more polar
solvents (entries 13–15). Thus, although CPAs 5a–e have shown different catalytic activities,
the substitution pattern had almost no influence on the stereoselection.
To improve the results, stronger Brønsted acids, such as NTPAs 6a–g, were tested, reasoning that an increased
acidity may lead to a closer ion pair and increase the enantioselectivity.
Therefore, we selected imide 2b for the MeLi addition/intramolecular
α-amidoalkylation sequence in toluene, as it had given the best
results in terms of enantioselection. As shown in Table 3, NTPAs 6a–g were significantly more active catalysts than the corresponding
phosphoric acids, affording 4bb in good to excellent
yields even at low temperature. The best results were obtained at
rt with catalysts 6a and 6e (entries 2 and
7), but the ee could not be improved at lower temperatures (entry
3).

These results show that although
the reactivity could be efficiently
enhanced using the adequate substitution patterns in both the hydroxylactam
and the CPA the simple ion pairing was not effective enough to afford
good enantioselectivities, and additional interaction of the nucleophile
with the CPA would be required, as has been shown for intermolecular
reactions.12b,31,32 For that purpose, we decided to test phenolic imides 2d and 2e (Tables 4 and 5). With these phenolic imides,
four equivalents of the organolithium reagent were required to afford
the corresponding hydroxylactam with full conversion. Then, the cyclization
was studied using CPAs 5a–e as catalysts
in different solvents (Table 4). As shown, phenolic hydroxylactams derived from 2d and 2e were in fact much more reactive than the corresponding
methoxylated derivatives and cyclization took place in various solvents
(toluene, dichloromethane, THF, acetonitrile) at rt in high yield
using catalyst 5a. However, no enantioselection was achieved
(Table 4, entries 1–6).
Phosphoric acids 5b–e also efficiently
promoted the cyclization in toluene at rt, and once again, the substitution
pattern did not have a significant impact on the enantioselectivity,
which remained low (entries 7–14). The best results were obtained
in THF at rt with catalyst 5c providing isoindoloisoquinoline 4db with 28% ee (entry 15). A similar enantioselection was
observed at a lower temperature (entry 16).

Once again, NTPAs 6 were much more efficient
than
binol-derived phosphoric acids 5 both in reactivity and
enantioselectivity, so the reactions could be performed in THF at
−20 °C (Table 5). In this case, although NTPAs 6a–f promoted the cyclization of the hydroxylactam derived from 2d in high yield, significant differences in the enantioselection
were observed (Table 5, entries 1–7). Thus, using catalyst 6c in THF
at −20 °C, up to 63% ee for 4db was achieved,
which could be improved to 75% ee after a single crystallization from
dichloromethane. A further optimization of the reaction conditions
using phosphoramide 6c in different solvents and temperatures
was also attempted, but the enantioselectivity was not improved. In
addition, other related catalysts, such as binol-derived disulfonamide
and TADDOL or VAPOL-derived phosphoric acids, were also tested, leading
to racemic compounds (see Tables S2 and S3 in the SI). Different substituents (R2 = n-Bu, Ph) could be introduced at C-12b just by changing the organolithium
reagent used in the formation of the hydroxylactam, with similar levels
of enantioselection (Table 5, entries 8 and 10), although the introduction of a bulky
group (R2 = t-Bu) precluded cyclization
even at higher temperatures (entry 9). The reaction could also be
extended to imide 2e, showing that the removal of one
phenolic group has an effect on the reactivity, obtaining 4eb in moderate yield, but with the same level of enantioselectivity
(60% ee, entry 11).

The absolute configuration was unambiguously
assigned by single-crystal
X-ray analysis of 4db as S (Figure 2, Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Center (CCDC) 1510852 contains the supplementary crystallographic
data for 4db; see SI). The
configuration of the other pyrrolo- and isoindoloisoquinolines was
assigned assuming a uniform mechanism. This result is in consonance
with the sense of induction reported in other CPA-catalyzed intramolecular
α-amidoalkylation reactions with tryptamine derivatives,16,17 through the formation of an N-acyliminium intermediate/chiral
conjugate base ion pair as II (Figure 2). It would be also consistent with the related
model proposed for the intermolecular reactions, in which the coordination
of the nucleophile with the catalyst through hydrogen bonding plays
a crucial role.12b,31,32 Thus, the acid would generate the chiral ion pair by protonation
of the hydroxylactam. The N-acyliminium intermediate
would be oriented in such a way to avoid the steric interactions with
catalyst 3 and 3′R substituents, so the bulkiest substituent
(the activated aromatic ring) would be directed toward the empty side
of the catalyst oxygen and the attack of the nucleophile, in this
case the internal activated aromatic ring, would occur from the Si
face. In addition, in the case of phenolic hydroxylactams 2d and 2e, a dual activation of the substrate by the catalyst
could be proposed through ion pairing and hydrogen bonding of the
phenolic hydroxyl group and the oxygen of the phosphate (II, Figure 2). Afterward,
a 6-endo-trig cyclization reaction with loss of aromaticity of the
phenolic aryl ring and subsequent hydrogen elimination would lead
to isoindoloisoquinoline 4. This type of phenol activation
has been proposed in related intermolecular reactions.7d,33 The crucial role of the hydrogen-bonding activation in the stereochemical
outcome of the reaction is shown in the α-amidoalkylation reaction
of hydroxylactam 2b (Table 3). In this case, the cyclization position
is highly activated by two methoxyl groups; however, the directing
effect of the hydrogen bonding of the phenolic hydroxyl group with
the catalyst is no longer possible, resulting in high yields but with
much lower enantioselectivity.

α-amidoalkylation
and X-ray structure of 4db.

In conclusion, it has been shown that activated electron-rich
aromatic
rings can be efficient internal nucleophiles in the N-acyliminium cyclization of cyclic α-hydroxylactams derived
from N-phenethylimides, using binol-derived phosphoric
acids as catalysts. Thus, access to fused isoquinoline systems is
possible, generating a new quaternary stereocenter. However, stable
hydroxylactams, such as those derived from imides 2a–d, are required to obtain good reactivity. In addition, binol-derived
triflylphosphoramides 6 have been shown to be substantially
more reactive than the corresponding binol-derived phosphoric acids 5. Phenolic substitution on the aromatic ring is a determinant
to achieve reasonable levels of enantioselection. Thus, a N-acyliminium chiral ion pair is proposed to be involved,
in which the phenolic internal nucleophile would be activated through
hydrogen bonding. This dual activation has been shown to be decisive
for the enantioselectivity, as in the absence of phenolic groups,
although the reaction proceeds with high yields, the enantioselectivity
is lost. This way, C-12b-substituted phenolic isoindoloisoquinolines
can be obtained in good yields and enantioselectivities up to 75%.
The procedure is complementary to the intermolecular α-amidoalkylation
process, as opposite enantiomers are formed, and to the Pictet–Spengler
cyclization, which allows the formation of only tertiary stereocenters,
and provides further evidence on the importance of dual activation
between the catalyst and the substrate for these reactions.

General Experimental Methods
Melting points were determined
in unsealed capillary tubes and are uncorrected. IR spectra were obtained
in film over NaCl pellets or using an attenuated total reflection
(ATR). NMR spectra were recorded at 20–25 °C, at 300 MHz
for 1H, and 75.5 MHz for 13C, or at 500 MHz
for 1H, and 125.7 MHz for 13C in CDCl3 solutions, unless otherwise stated. Assignments of individual 13C and 1H resonances are supported by distortionless
enhancement by polarization transfer experiments and two-dimensional
correlation experiments (COSY, HSQCed, or HMBC). Mass spectra were
recorded under chemical ionization (CI) at 230 eV or with an electrospray
ionization (ESI+) source. The exact mass was obtained using
a time-of-flight (TOF) detector. Crystal 4db was measured
at 100 K using a Cu single-crystal diffractometer (omega scan mode)
using a charge-coupled device detector. The structure was solved using
SIR92 and refined with standard methods using SHELXL9 with anisotropic
parameters for the nonhydrogen atoms. All hydrogens were located on
the residual density map and were refined with the SHELXL97 riding
model. Analysis of the absolute structure using likelihood methods
was performed using PLATON (see SI for
details). Thin-layer chromatography was carried out with 0.2 mm thick
silica gel plates. Visualization was accomplished by UV light. Flash
column chromatography was performed on silica gel (230–400
mesh). Chiral stationary phase HPLC was performed using CHIRALCEL
OD3, IC, ADH, or OC columns (0.46 cm × 25 cm) in isocratic elution
mode, as indicated in each case. All solvents used in the reactions
were anhydrous and purified according to standard procedures.34 Organolithiums were titrated with diphenylacetic
acid or N-benzylbenzamide periodically prior to use.
Imides 1b–c,25e2a,27a and 2b–e35 were
prepared according to literature procedures. Phosphoric acids (R)-5a–e were used from
commercial sources with the following purities: 5a: 98+%; 5b: 95%; 5c: 95%; 5d: >97.5%;
and 5e: 95%. Phosphoramides 6a–g were prepared from the corresponding (R)-binols
according to literature procedures.29 All
air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were performed under argon; the
glassware was dried (130 °C) and purged with argon.
