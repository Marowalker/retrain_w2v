The gelation ability of 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)isophthalic
acid (click-TIA) in the presence of different metal acetates
has been studied in different solvents and ligand/metal ratios. This
manuscript is focused on the metallogel obtained from the combination
of click-TIA and copper(II) acetate, which has been used
as a model system in terms of characterization and gelation studies.
Sonication treatment of the initial mixture of compounds and the nature
of the counter anion were found to be critical factors for the supramolecular
assembly of the metal/click-TIA complexes and, hence,
for the formation of stable and homogeneous metallogels. The gel materials
have been characterized with a variety of techniques including infrared,
rheology, UV–vis spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and
scanning electron microscopy.

1 Introduction
Supramolecular
gels have gained great attention because of their
potential applications in diverse fields including, among others,
biomedicines,1−4 sensors,5,6 catalysis,7 environmental
remediation,8−10 and material synthesis.11−13 These viscoelastic
materials are made by self-assembly of either low-molecular weight
(LMW) molecules or polymers (so-called gelators), via noncovalent
interactions (e.g., hydrogen-bonding, van der Waals, π–π
stacking, charge-transfer, coordination interactions, etc).14−19 The solid-like appearance of these materials and their rheological
properties are the result of the immobilization of the liquid phase
(major component) in the interstices of an entangled self-assembled
solid matrix, usually by capillary forces and surface tension phenomena.20−25 Metallogels, containing often discrete metal coordination complexes
of LMW ligands or well-defined coordination polymers, are promising
materials for numerous applications in materials science because of
their redox, electronic, magnetic, and optical properties, providing
a variety of stimuli-responsive “smart” materials and
catalytic gels.26−34

Nevertheless, the logical design of new functional gels is
difficult
because of the lack of information about the molecular self-assembly
process, many of the systems reported so far being examples of accidental
discoveries. However, there are some general strategies to obtain
a more rational design route toward new metallogels, which are based
on either a molecular engineering approach or on structure–property
correlations.35

A few years ago,
we reported the preparation of 3D porous, crystalline
metal–organic frameworks as well as stable viscoelastic metallogels,
starting from the same organic ligand [i.e. 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)isophthalic acid (5-TIA)], divalent
metal ion (i.e. Ca(II)), and organic solvent [i.e. dimethylformamide
(DMF)].36 The system favored the formation
of a crystalline MOF in the presence of water, whereas the water-free
system induced gelation. A few years later, we demonstrated that the
isosteric replacement,37,38 a well-established paradigm in
medicinal chemistry, could be successfully applied to the synthesis
of new supramolecular gels with tailored functionality.39 Isosters40 have been
defined as compounds or groups that possess near-equal molecular shapes
and volumes, approximately the same distribution of electrons, and
exhibit similar physical properties.41 As
a first proof of concept, the gelation ability of a glutamic acid-based
gelator was compared with its isostere, where the amide moiety was
replaced by a 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole unit. The results of
that study indicated superior features in terms of gelation ability
and gel properties for the materials prepared with the click-isosteric
gelator in polar protic solvents, whereas the amide-based gelator
was the best system for nonpolar solvents.39 More recently, and in order to obtain new functional materials,
we decided to apply the isosteric replacement on 5-TIA and we demonstrated that the simple substitution of the 1,2,4-triazole
moiety by the 1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl unit enables
the preparation of a new gelator (i.e. click-TIA) that
can form hydrogels upon sonication, whereas 5-TIA alone
lacks the ability to gel water.42

In this manuscript, we demonstrate that click-TIA can
also be used to obtain new metallogels by combination with different
metal acetates and sonication treatment. These metallogels have been
characterized with different techniques, considering the gel prepared
from click-TIA and copper(II) acetate as a model system.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and X-ray Crystal
Structure of Click-TIA
Click-TIA was synthesized
in four steps starting from commercially available dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate
(1) following our previously described procedure.42 Briefly, the alkyne unit was introduced into
the aromatic ring by a classical Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction
using trimethylsilylacetylene and the corresponding aromatic trifluoromethanesulfonate
derivative of the starting dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate (i.e. dimethyl
5-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)isophthalate) (Scheme 1). Deprotection of the trimethylsilyl
group of the so-obtained alkyne 2 with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride afforded dimethyl 5-ethynylisophthalate
(3). Subsequent copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne
cycloaddition using azidotrimethylsilane as the azide source afforded
the expected dimethyl 5-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-5-yl)isophthalate
(4) in excellent overall yield (>95%). Finally, alkaline
hydrolysis of the ester groups yielded the desired click-TIA in nearly quantitative yield.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure for the Preparation
of Click-TIA
The X-ray crystal structure analysis of click-TIA further
confirmed its chemical structure and solid-state packing. Single crystal
of click-TIA was obtained from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
solution by slow evaporation. From X-ray crystallography, it is evident
that the asymmetric unit contains one molecule of click-TIA and one DMSO molecule. There is an O–H···O
hydrogen bond between click-TIA and DMSO molecule (Figure 1A). In higher order
packing, the individual subunits of click-TIA are themselves
regularly interlinked through multiple intermolecular hydrogen-bonding
interaction, O–H···N and DMSO-mediated hydrogen-bonding
interactions and thereby form a supramolecular sheet-like structure
along the crystallographic b and c directions (Figure 1B).

hydrogen bond is shown as dotted line. (B) Packing diagram of click-TIA showing DMSO-mediated supramolecular sheet-like
structure. O–H···O, N–H···O,
and O–H···N hydrogen bonds are shown as dotted
lines.

2.2 Preparation
and Characterization of Metallogels
Control experiments showed
that click-TIA alone does
not form any gel in organic solvents, even after sonication. However,
the combination of click-TIA with copper(II) acetate
monohydrate (CuA), Cu(OAc)2·H2O, and subsequent
sonication resulted in the formation of blue opaque gels (Figure S1). Note that, only sonication or stirring
is not enough to get a homogeneous gel. During initial experiments,
we found that the use of other metal acetates also enabled the formation
of metallogels under similar conditions (vide infra). At this point,
we decided to take the mixture [click-TIA + CuA] in DMF
as a model system to optimize the gelation ability and characterize
the corresponding metallogels. Thus, the critical gelation concentration
(CGC) for this system was established as 0.1 M in each component.
Interestingly, different concentrations and ratios between click-TIA and CuA also afforded the formation of stable metallogels (Table 1).

c Gelation overnight. Note: unless
otherwise indicated, gelation was observed immediately after sonication.

Moreover, a series of studies
were carried out to determine the
influence of the metal counter anion on the gelation phenomenon (Table S1). Interestingly, we found that only
acetate anions are able to form gels in DMF. Only in the case of silver,
triflate could be used as an anion to form a gel with click-TIA in toluene. Other anions such as nitrate, chlorate, fluoride, chloride,
and sulfate led to the formation of clear solutions upon sonication
at room temperature (RT). These results indicate that the counter
anion plays an important role in the supramolecular assembly of Cu/click-TIA complexes.

Furthermore, the gelation ability
of the gelator system [CuA + click-TIA] was evaluated
for various solvents upon sonication
at RT for 5 min. We found that stable gels could be obtained immediately
during sonication in at least three solvents: DMF, DMA, and pyridine.
In contrast, partial gelation was observed in DMSO and glycerin (Table S2). MeOH was able to form a green gel
after approximately one week. Interestingly, ethyl acetate and acetic
anhydride decolorized the CuA solution, presumably through forming
a Cu(I) species. Water afforded a clear solution of both the ligand
and the metal salt, whereas the gelator system was found to be insoluble
in the rest of the tested solvents (Table S1). It is important to emphasize that although click-TIA is able to form hydrogels in the absence of any metal salt,42 it is unable to gel organic solvents by its
own. The effect of water to form either MOFs or metallogels was previously
reported with 5-TIA,36 the
isostere of click-TIA. Therefore, we decided to check
the role of water in the gelation ability of our model system [CuA
(0.2 M) + click-TIA (0.2 M)] (Table S3). The results established a ratio H2O/DMF of
2:3 (v/v) as the maximum limit of water tolerance, above which neither
gelation nor MOF formation was observed (i.e. only precipitate was
obtained above this limit).

To gain additional insight into
the complexation process, metallogels
1–3 with 0.2 M click-TIA and varying amounts of
CuA (0.5–1.5 equiv) were prepared and further investigated.
Thus, metallogel-1 was prepared from the mixture click-TIA/CuA 0.2 M:0.1 M, metallogel-2 from click-TIA/CuA 0.2
M:0.2 M, and metallogel-3 from click-TIA/CuA 0.2 M:0.3
M.

Oscillatory rheological experiments were performed in order
to
confirm the viscoelastic gel state and to examine the mechanical differences
between metallogels 1–3 (Table 2 and Figure S2). First,
the storage modulus G′ and the loss modulus G″ were measured as a function of shear strain (dynamic
strain sweep experiment, DSS) and angular frequency ω (dynamic
frequency sweep experiment, DFS) to determine the linear viscoelastic
regime. Within the linearity limits of deformation, G′ was one order of magnitude higher than the loss modulus G″ in all three cases. Only for metallogel-1, a weak
frequency dependence was observed. With increasing CuA content, the
storage modulus was 13, 960, and 1810 Pa for metallogel-1, -2, and
-3, respectively. Interestingly, the highest dissipation factor, tan
δ (G″/G′) value,
was obtained for metallogel-1 (tan δ = 0.166) and the lowest
for metallogel-2 (tan δ = 0.100) (Table 2). Moreover, the obtained critical stress
or yield point (γ) was significantly high for metallogel-2 with
80%, whereas only 16 and 32% were achieved for metallogel-1 and -2,
respectively. These results suggest that metallogel-2 formed with
an equimolar mixture of click-TIA and CuA, which has
the greatest mechanical stability and damping coefficient.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the
xerogels obtained
from the corresponding metallogels 1–3 (Figure S3) showed a strong absorption band of the carboxylic
acid at 1640 cm–1, which lies between the frequencies
of the free ligand at 1707 cm–1 and that from CuA
at 1595 cm–1 because of metal-coordinated carboxylates.
This is in agreement with the formation of strong metal–ligand
complexes. Furthermore, free CuA typically shows two absorption bands
at 1438 and 1420 cm–1, corresponding to antisymmetric
νa(COO–) and symmetric versus(COO–) vibrations, whereas the xerogels displayed only one
peak, which is shifted to lower frequencies (1394 cm–1). The spectroscopic analyses showed that the intensities of the
peaks observed for the xerogels depend on the click-TIA/CuA ratio. Interestingly, the intensities decrease following the
order: metallogel-2 > metallogel-1 > metallogel-3, that is,
the xerogel
prepared with the highest CuA content displays the lowest intensities.
This can be explained considering that the increase of Cu2+ ion concentration facilitates more interactions with the carboxylic
groups, leading to less free vibration of the C=O stretching.
Furthermore, this observation suggests that the orientation between click-TIA and CuA is different depending on the molar ligand/metal
ratio.

The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern of the xerogels
obtained
by freeze-drying (FD) the corresponding metallogels 1–3 was
compared with that from pure click-TIA powder. The data
revealed a structural evolution of ligand/Cu aggregates with increasing
CuA concentrations (Figure S4). Specifically,
at 0.5 equiv, the pattern still resembles that of the pure ligand,
although the reflexes at 2θ = 21.9°, 25.7°, and 27.4°
disappeared. At the equimolar ratio between click-TIA and CuA, additional reflexes appeared at 2θ = 2.2°–19.9°,
which is in concordance with an aggregation process. With further
increase in CuA concentration to 1.5 equiv, only two reflexes at small
2θ (8.7° and 10.4°) were observed. The PXRD patterns
showed that there are different types of assemblies between click-TIA and CuA, which are ratio-dependent and was further
confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
(vide infra).

The UV–vis spectrum of the ligand in DMF
displayed a broad
absorption at ca. 305 nm and a clear peak at ca. 266 nm responsible
for π–π* transitions (Figure S5A). In contrast, pure CuA typically shows only one peak at
ca. 280 with a tail extended until ca. 400 nm. As expected, both the
absorption bands and the fluorescence band (ca. 350 nm) of the ligand
increased with increasing concentration (Figure S5B). As expected, spectral changes were observed upon the
addition of CuA aliquots to solutions of click-TIA (Figure S6). Interestingly, by increasing the
amount of CuA the peak at ca. 305 nm disappeared and the peak at ca.
266 nm shifted to ca. 270 nm, increasing until a ratio click-TIA/CuA 6:4 was reached. Further addition of CuA caused the decreasing
of this peak again. The existence of nonideal isosbestic points suggested
the formation of oligomers or polymers in the complexation process
between click-TIA and CuA. Thus, metal–ligand
interactions developed between click-TIA and CuA provide
not only thermodynamic stability but also kinetic liability to the
metastable gel phase. Therefore, the competing thermodynamic pathway
toward crystallization is slowed down with the help of additional
noncovalent interactions, such as hydrophobic interactions, π–π
interactions, and hydrogen bonding. All these noncovalent interactions
contribute to define the structure of the supramolecular gel, which
is partly governed by the kinetics of phase separation and the viscosity
of the system. On the basis of the X-ray analysis (vide supra), ligand–solvent
interactions may also play a key role in the association and stabilization
of the supramolecular aggregates involving multiple hydrogen bonds.

Additionally, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
images of the xerogels obtained from the metallogels 1–3 were
obtained in order to gain insights into the microstructure of the
materials (Figures 2, S7–S9). The images confirmed
that the CuA content remarkably influences the morphology of the xerogels.
Specifically, the xerogel obtained from metallogel-1 composes spherical
structures with sizes of ca. 5 μm (Figure 1A), which consist of entangled fibers resembling
hard corals with diameters below 0.5 μm (Figure S7). Spherical structures were also observed with xerogels
obtained from metallogel-2, that is, equimolar ratio between click-TIA and CuA, although in this case, they seemed to be
covered by a layer of ca. 2 μm (Figure 1C,D). Besides spheres and layers, twined
fibers were also observed in various specimens with a diameter of
ca. 1–2 μm and an inner cavity of ca. 200 nm, which seems
to be recoiled layers (Figure 1B). A porous material consisting of densed aggregates below
100 nm (Figure 1F)
was observed with xerogels obtained from metallogel-3, which is interspersed
with hollow tubes of ca. 4 μm (Figure 1E). Although, we have recorded representative
images of the bulk materials to recognize any possible artifact, it
should be stressed that significant changes in the microstructures
could take place during the preparation of the dried samples and,
hence, the interpretation of these images should always be done cautiously.

images of the xerogels of (A) metallogel-1, (B–D),
metallogel-2, and (E,F) metallogel-3.

Interestingly, the metallogels displayed different thermostabilities
at temperatures ranging from RT to 150 °C, which was accompanied
in all cases by a color change from greenish-blue to green (Figure S10). The highest thermostability was
observed for metallogel-1, whereas metallogel-2 lost about half of
the liquid phase during the ramp of temperature. In addition, metallogel-2
and metallogel-3 seemed to get inhomogeneous after heating to 150
°C, which needs to be further investigated in order to draw mechanistic
conclusions. It is worth mentioning that heating the metallogels for
prolonged time caused the formation of precipitates instead of gel-to-sol
transitions. The specific nature of these precipitates (presumably
metal organic frameworks) will be evaluated in future research.

Finally, preliminary experiments demonstrated that click-TIA is also able to form stable fibrillar gels with a variety of other
metal salts such as Pd(OAc)2 (brown gel), Zn(OAc)2 (ivory-colored gel), and Mn(OAc)3•4H2O (dark brown gel) (Figures S11–S13). These gels were obtained at RT both in DMF and DMSO, following
the same general procedure used for the preparation of the gel made
using copper acetate (vide supra). Initial UV–vis and fluorescence
measurements confirmed the formation of metal complexes (Figure S12). Further studies of these and other
potential metallogels based on click-TIA are currently
underway in our laboratories and the results will be reported in due
course.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
the compound 5-TIA (click-TIA) constitutes
a versatile ligand for the preparation of new metallogels
upon controlled combination with different metal acetates. The results
obtained from the study of the model system formed by the mixture click-TIA and copper(II) acetate have revealed a series of
critical factors that dominate the supramolecular assembly of the
metal complexes. Thus, sonication of the initial mixture, ligand/metal
ratio, nature of the solvent, and type of the counter anion play critical
roles in the formation of stable viscoelastic 3D networks with specific
morphologies, thermal, and mechanical properties.

4.1 Materials and Methods
Unless otherwise
noted, all reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used
as received without further purification. All solvents for synthesis
were dried by distillation. Compound 5-TIA (click-TIA) was synthesized and purified, following our previously reported
procedure.421H NMR (500 MHz,
DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) 8.43 (s, 1H),
8.63 (s, 3H), 13.44 (br s, 2H), 15.26 (br s, 1H); 13C NMR
(125 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ (ppm) 129.3
(d), 130.0 (d), 132.2 (s), 166.5 (s); mp 271–272 °C; HRMS
(ESI): m/z calcd for C10H6N3O4 [M – H], 232.0358;
found, 232.0357. Sonication treatments were done using a sonication
bath USC200th VWR, 45 kHz, 60 W. UV–vis spectra were obtained
on Ocean Optics DH2000-BAL UV–vis/NIR or on a PerkinElmer (Lambda
35) spectrophotometer using a 1 cm path length quartz cell. FT-IR
spectra were obtained with an Agilent Technologies Cary 630 FTIR spectrometer
equipped with Golden Gate Diamond ATR (attenuated total reflection).
Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer fluorescent spectrometer
(LS 55) using a 1 cm path length quartz cell. Slit widths 2.5/2.5
were used. Single crystal X-ray diffraction experiment was performed
on a Bruker APEX-2 CCD diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation.
Data were processed using the Bruker SAINT package and the structure
solution and refinement procedures were performed using SHELX97. The
nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters.
Crystallographic data of click-TIA: C10H7N3O4, C2H6O6, Mw = 311.31, space group P121/N1, a = 6.7758(7), b = 15.4192(11), c = 13.0681(11) Å,
α = 6.7758° β = 95.261° γ = 90°,
V = 1359.6(2) Å3, Z = 4, dm = 1.521 Mgm–3, T = 100 K, R1 0.1427 and wR2 0.3550 for 2274
data with I > 2σ(I). The
data
for click-TIA have been submitted at the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Center with reference number CCDC 1881063. PXRD experiments were
performed on a STOE STADI P powder diffractometer (Start Fragment
Transmission mode, flat samples, Dectris Mythen 1k microstrip solid-state
detector, Debye–Scherrer geometry) with Cu Kα1 radiation
(λ = 1.540598 Å) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The experiments
were measured in the range 2° ≤ 2 θ ≤ 90°.
Conditions: start fragment 0.0151°, time 60 s/step. Lattice spacings
were calculated from Bragg’s law. CGC, defined as the minimum
gelator concentration (both click-TIA and metal salt)
necessary for gelation, was estimated by weighting different amounts
of click-TIA and adding different amounts of the previously
prepared metal acetate stock solution, and applying the sonication
protocol as described above. Herein, CGC was established with respect
to the absence of gravitational flow. Dynamic oscillatory rheological
measurements of the gels (total volume = 2 mL) were performed with
an AR 2000 Advanced rheometer (TA Instruments) equipped with a Julabo
C cooling system. A 500 μm gap setting and a torque setting
of 5 × 10–4 N/m at 25 °C were used for
the measurements in a plain-plate geometry (40 mm, stainless steel).
Evolution of the storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli was studied as follows. DSS measurements
were first performed between 0.1 and 100% strain at 1 Hz frequency
to establish the strain value at which reasonable torque values were
given (ca. 10 times of the transducer resolution limit). Subsequently,
DFS measurements (from 0.1 to 10 Hz at 0.1% strain) and time sweep
measurements (DTS) within the linear viscoelastic regime (0.1% strain
and 1 Hz frequency) were carried out. Field-Emission Scanning Electron
Microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the bulk xerogels were obtained with
Zeiss Merlin, FE-SEM (accelerating voltage 10 kV) or with a JEOL scanning
microscope-JSM-6700F (accelerating voltage 5–7 kV). For visualization,
samples were prepared by the FD method as following: A 4 mL glass
vial containing the corresponding gel (total volume = 1 mL) was frozen
in liquid nitrogen and the solvent was immediately evaporated under
reduced pressure (0.6 mmHg) overnight at RT. The obtained fibrous
solid was placed on top of a tin plate and shielded with Au or Pt
(40 mA during 30–60 s; film thickness = 5–10 nm). Images
were taken at the University of Zaragoza (Servicio General de Apoyo
a la Investigación-SAI) and at the IISER Kolkata FE-SEM facility.

4.2 General Procedure for the Preparation of Metallogels
Typically, a weighted amount of click-TIA and an appropriate
amount of a metal acetate stock solution were placed into a screw-capped
glass vial (4 cm length × 1 cm diameter). The mixture was quickly
stirred with a spatula and then sonicated for ca. 5 min at RT until
everything was homogeneous. The resulting solution was maintained
at RT until the gel was formed. The material was preliminary classified
as the gel if it did not exhibit gravitational flow upon turning the
vial upside-down at RT to form a green-blue homogeneous gel. The gel
state was further confirmed by oscillatory rheological measurements.
Three model formulations with different click-TIA/CuA
ratios were used for further characterization: metallogel-1 (click-TIA/CuA 0.2 M:0.1 M), metallogel-2 (click-TIA/CuA 0.2 M:0.2 M), and metallogel-3 (click-TIA/CuA 0.2
M:0.3 M). The same general procedure was used to prepare metallogels
using other metal salts as indicated in the main text.
