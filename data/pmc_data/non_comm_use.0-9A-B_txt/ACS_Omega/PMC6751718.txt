Radical-scavenging activity of isorhamnetin
(1) and
its diglycosides, named isorhamnetin-3,5’-O-β-D-diglucoside (2) and isorhamnetin-3,7-O-β-D-diglucoside (3) extracted from Anoectochilus roxburghii, has been studied through three main antioxidant pathways: hydrogen
atom transfer (HAT), single electron transfer followed by proton transfer,
and sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET). All thermodynamic
parameters related to these radical-scavenging mechanisms were computed
at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory both in the gas phase and
in solution. The results suggest that HAT is the predominant mechanism
in the gas phase, while SPLET is supported in an aqueous environment.
In addition, the stability of radicals has also been explored by electron
spin density and intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The potential energy
profiles and kinetic calculations for the reactions between the selected
compounds and the CH3OO• radical were
calculated at 298.15 K. Among all investigated, compound 2 has the highest antioxidant activity with the lowest Gibbs free
energy (−4.05 kcal/mol) and the highest hydrogen atom transfer
rate constant (3.61 × 105 M–1 s–1). Substitution of the OH and OMe groups by two glucoses
at the 3 and 5′ sites of isorhamnetin has a significant impact
on its antioxidant activity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Human
body has natural immune systems to protect our health to
avoid the aging process and diseases. When the immune system gets
weaker, the development of numerous diseases increases through oxidative
stress. Oxidative stress is known as a “chemical silent killer”.1 This process arises from oxidative damage of
biomolecules (such as proteins, lipids, enzymes, and DNA) by the presence
of reactive free radicals.2 Oxidative stress
is caused by an imbalance between antioxidants and oxidants (free
radicals or reactive species) in favor of oxidants.3

Antioxidants play a significant role in oxidative
stress resistance,
also labeled as “free radical scavengers”. Recently,
antioxidants such as natural flavonoids have grown greatly due to
their high antioxidant activity, nontoxic effects on human beings,
and safety to the environment.4 They are
mainly found in vegetables, fruits, cereals, and medicinal plants.4,5

In natural compounds, Anoectochilus roxburghii is known as a good source of organic compounds, which are used as
traditional medicines for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, liver
diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and so on.6 Recent research has revealed that flavonoids and its glycosides
have been isolated from A. roxburghii that have remarkable bioactivities, allowing the scavenging of free
radicals.7 Water solubility of flavonoid
glycosides is better than that of flavonoids because sugar moieties
have a hydrophilic nature.8,9 Moreover, many studies
show that the presence of the glucosidic group at different positions
in flavonoids may affect the antioxidant activity and the mechanism
of their biological activities.10−12 For example, Zheng et al. demonstrated
that the presence of glucosidic group at the 4′ and 5 positions
of quercetin would enhance the antioxidant activity, while the substitution
on other sites would reduce the antioxidant activity.10 However, no data are available in the literature to predict
the radical-scavenging activity for diglycoside flavonoids at the
molecular level. Therefore, an understanding of the diglycoside substitution
effect on the antioxidative capability of flavonoids is important.

According to the literature, the radical-scavenging activity of
flavonoid antioxidants was analyzed via three of the most useful mechanisms
as follows:13−17 hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), single electron transfer followed
by proton transfer (SET-PT), and sequential proton loss electron transfer
(SPLET). All thermodynamic parameters descriptor for each step of
these mechanisms including bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE), ionization
energy (IE), proton dissociation enthalpy (PDE), proton affinity (PA),
and electron-transfer enthalpy (ETE) were used to elucidate the antioxidative
potential of the investigated compounds.

In this work, the antioxidative
activity of isorhamnetin (1) and its diglycosides, named
isorhamnetin-3,5′-O-β-D-diglucoside (2) and isorhamnetin-3,7-O-β-D-diglucoside (3) (Figure 1) that had been extracted
from A. roxburghii, were studied in
detail using the density functional theory (DFT).
Relying on the thermodynamic descriptors concerned to the mechanisms
of antioxidative action, the purpose of this study is to evaluate
their radical-scavenging capacity through three mechanisms as mentioned
above in the gas phase and in solution. Finally, the potential energy
surfaces and rate constants (k) of the reaction between
diglycosyl flavonoids and hydroperoxyl radicals (CH3OO•) were evaluated for an insight into their mechanism
of action.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermodynamic Calculation
The calculated
results of the reaction enthalpies for the investigated compounds
in gas and solvent phases related to three radical-scavenging mechanisms
(HAT, SET-PT, and SPLET) are presented in Tables 1 and S1 (Supporting
Information). Based on thermodynamic parameters (BDE, IE, PDE, PA,
and ETE), we can predict the most-active site for the radical-scavenging
reaction of the investigated compounds and the thermodynamically preferred
reaction pathway.

The different positions of OH and
glucosidic groups on A, B, and
C rings of the flavonoid skeleton will impact the radical-scavenging
potency of 1, 2, and 3 compounds.
The most-active OH group of the title compounds was determined by
the minimal sum of the enthalpies of the specific reaction pathways
including BDEmin, (IE + PDE)min, and (PA + ETE)min.18 Based on the BDEmin, (IE + PDE)min, and (PA + ETE)min values
shown in Tables 1 and S1, the preferred OH site of each of the title
compounds was the same in HAT, SET-PT, and SPLET mechanisms.

For specific compounds, the calculated BDEs of OH groups in the
gas phase and in solution are shown in Table 1 in the following order

No sugar group
at different rings of isorhamnetin (compound 1): 3-OH
≈ 4′-OH < 7-OH < 5-OH.

For sugar groups
at B and C rings of isorhamnetin (compound 2): 4′-OH
< 7-OH < 5-OH.

Sugar groups present at A and C rings of
isorhamnetin (compound 3): 4′-OH < 5-OH.

In compound 1, BDE(O–H)s at O4′ and
O3 positions are lower than one at other sites in the gas phase (Table 1). It means that H-atom-transfer
process from O4′ and O3 sites is more preferred than that from
other positions. From data in Table 1, it is seen that the difference between the BDEs for
4′-OH and 3-OH groups is quite low, about 1.1 kcal/mol, corresponding
to the gas phase. Many previous research works have also demonstrated
that the role of 3-OH site and C2–C3 double bond in the flavonoid
core has a significant impact on their antioxidant activity.19−21 The preferred site for compound 1 is 3-OH because the
3-O• phenoxyl radical is formed more stably by expanding
delocalization of electrons over the C ring via 4-keto, C2–C3
double bond. In both compounds 2 and 3,
the lowest BDEs are found for the 4′-OH group at B ring. Conversely,
BDE values for 5-OH of 1, 2, and 3 are remarkably larger than the BDE values of other OH groups. This
can be explained by the formation of hydrogen bonds between 5-OH of
A ring and −C=O of C ring. Especially, BDE for 4′-OH
of compound 2 (75.3 kcal/mol) is the lowest compared
to the BDE(O–H) values of compounds 1 and 3. This means that the H-atom donation ability to scavenge
the radical at the O4′ site of compound 2 is more
preferred than for other compounds. The high reactivity of this site
could be explained by the glycosyl substitution at O-5′ and
O-3 site decreases the negative charge on the oxygen atom at O-4′
and increases polarization of the O–H bonds. Additionally,
the 4′-O• phenoxyl radical of compound 2 is more stable by the intramolecular hydrogen bond because
of the presence of the glycosyl group. This will be further demonstrated
in Section 2.2.

The BDEmin is an important parameter to evaluate the H-atom-transfer
ability to scavenge the free radical.22,23 As shown in Table 1, the lowest O–H
BDE values for the investigated compounds in the gas phase can be
ranged in the following sequence: 2 < 1 < 3. On comparing the BDEmin value of compound 2 with those of 1 and 3, the value
decreases by 3.7 and 5.7 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the obtained
result shows that compound 2 has a higher radical-scavenging
potency than that of the compounds 1 and 3. In other words, the glycosyl groups present at the B and C rings
of isorhamnetin are better antioxidants than the one at A and C rings
of isorhamnetin.

In this work, the computed BDE in solution
(water and ethanol)
is due to the reason that these solvents are commonly used to extract
flavonoid glucosides from A. roxburghii.7 In the solvents, these BDE values tended
to slightly increase by 2–3 kcal/mol, except the 5-OH BDE.
Unlike other OH groups, the 5-OH BDE in the gas phase is higher by
1–3 kcal/mol than that in solution. This shift may be related
to the distortion of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between 5-OH
and C=O group in solvents. As can be concluded, substituting
the hydroxyl group by the glycosyl group in flavonoids has a strongly
influence on their antioxidant activity through the HAT mechanism.

For SET-PT and SPLET mechanisms including multiple steps, the first
step plays the most important role from the thermodynamic viewpoint.
Corresponding to the first steps of two these mechanisms, the lowest
IE and PA values indicate the predominant mechanism and reaction pathway
from the thermodynamic point of view.24 From Table 1, it
can be seen that the thermodynamic descriptors related to SET-PT and
SPLET are greatly impacted by the solvation enthalpies due to these
mechanisms involving charged species.19,25,26

For the SET-PT mechanism, IE is a key factor
showing the range
of electron donation. It is clearly from Table 1, the IEs of investigated compounds arranged
in the order of gas > ethanol > water. When there is a change
from
the gas phase to water, the IE decreased dramatically with an average
deviation of 56.3 kcal/mol. Thus, the electron-transfer process is
favorable in the solvent. Based on the IE values of the studied compounds,
the antioxidant activity can be ranged in the following order: 2 > 1 > 3. From the calculated
data
in Table 1, it is obtaining
that the trend of the IEs and BDEs is the same. However, the calculated
IE values are significantly larger than the corresponding BDE values,
thus indicating that HAT is a more thermodynamically favorable mechanism
than SET-PT in all of the studied environments.

In the case
of SPLET mechanism, the order of PA values in the studies
environments is gas > ethanol > water for the same molecules.
From
the gas phase to solution, the PA values decrease drastically because
of the relatively high enthalpies of proton and anion solvation. The
average deviation between the gas phase and water is 298.3 kcal/mol.
This means that the protonation process is more preferred to occur
in polar solvents. In the gas phase, the calculated PAs are extraordinarily
high compared to the BDE and IE values. On the other hand, in water,
PAs are significantly lower than BDEs and IEs, meaning that SPLET
is a more favorable mechanism than HAT and SET-PT. The antioxidant
activity of the studied compounds can be ranked according to the lowest
PA values in the following sequence: 2 > 3 > 1. Therefore, the substitution of the OH and OMe
groups by two glucoses at the 3 and 5′ positions would increase
the antioxidant ability of isorhamnetin via the SPLET mechanism in
solution.

Based on the analysis above, we can draw conclusions
that HAT is
the most predominant reaction pathway in the gas phase and SPLET is
the most preferred mechanism in water from the thermodynamic viewpoint.

2.2 Electron Spin Density and Atoms in Molecules
(AIM) Analysis
To further gain an understanding of the stability
of the radicals, the electron spin density and intramolecular hydrogen
bonds were investigated by AIM analysis. Since these are other important
factors that influence the radical-scavenging ability of studied compounds.
The more stable the free radical, the stronger the antioxidative capability.
Electron spin density can be used to explain the stability of formed
radical species. The more extended the electronic delocalization,
the more stable the formed radical.27,28 The data in Figure 2 shows that spin
density distributions in the O3 and O4′ sites of all of the
investigated compounds are 0.310, 0.320, 0.322, and 0.340, corresponding
to 2-O4′, 1-O3, 1-O4′, and 3-O4′ radicals, respectively.
This shows that the stabilization of formed radicals decreases in
the following sequence: 2-O4′ > 1-O3 > 1-O4′ >
3-O4′.
Therefore, the formation of 2-O4′ radical is more favorable
than other radicals.

Figure 2 Spin density distribution of radicals formed from compounds 1, 2, and 3 computed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level in the gas phase.

In addition, the AIM
topological analysis was selected to investigate
the characteristics of intramolecular bond for the formed radicals
(Figure 3). These intramolecular
hydrogen bond plays a more important role in stabilizing the radical.
To evaluate the stabilization effect of the radical, the topological
parameters of the bond critical points (BCPs) including electron density
(ρ), Laplacian of the charge density (∇2ρ(r)), local potential energy density (V(r)), local gradient kinetic energy density (G(r)), and total energy density (H(r)) are summarized in Table 2. According to the study of Rozas et al.,
the covalent nature of bonding in these systems is classified as a
weak hydrogen bond because of the positive values of ∇2ρ(r) (0.0098–0.0225 au), H(r) (0.0010–0.0027 au), and G(r)/|V(r)| (1.1429–1.1709) > 1.29 However,
the weak interactions of the radical of the studied compounds include
not only hydrogen bonding but also another interaction type called
“tetrel bonding”.30 The tetrel
bonding is defined as a subtype of the simple electrostatic interaction.
For instance, in the 3-O4′ radical, no hydrogen bond is formed
in which the O4′-BCP-C7′ path is dictated by the topology
of the electron density. Moreover, the sum of the E values of the contacts are more negative, the radicals are more
stable. Therefore, based on the total E, we can predict
that the order of stability for radicals is 2-O4′ > 1-O3
>
1-O4′ > 3-O4′, respectively. Substitution of hydroxyl
and methoxyl groups at 3 and 5′ sites by glucose has a significant
impact on the stabilization of 2-O4′ and thus the lower BDE.

2.3 CH3OO• Radical-Scavenging
Capability
The previous studies showed that the contribution
of the rate constants following the radical adduct formation (RAF)
mechanism between phenolic compounds and ROO• radicals
(i.e., HOO•) into the overall rate constants was
minor.31,32 Thus, in this study, our interest is focused
on the investigation of the interaction of the CH3OO• radical with the antioxidant molecules via the HAT
mechanism. Based on the calculated BDE values, the weakest O–H
bonds are found at O4′ position of compounds 1, 2, 3 and O3 position of compound 1. Thus, to better understand the H donation process, the
potential energy surfaces were calculated for the reaction between
CH3OO• and the studied compounds (Figure 4). All structural
optimizations were performed in the gas phase at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level. Cartesian coordinates and molecular enthalpies of all transition
states (TS) of the H-abstraction reaction are presented in Table S2, and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)
plots for these transition states are also shown in Figure S1.

Figure 4 Potential energy surface of the reaction between the selected
compounds
and CH3OO• radical.

As can be seen in Figure 4, the tendency for all reaction paths of the studied compounds
with CH3OO• is quite similar. This theoretical
observation is quite coherent with several previous studies.33−35 The first intermediates named Int1-1-O3, Int1-1-O4′, Int1-2-O4′,
and Int1-3-O4′ are formed and lying lower than the reactants
by an amount of −2.9, −1.6, −5.8, and −1.9
kcal/mol, respectively. Then, the channels of reactions through transition
states (TS) are characterized by relative energies of 1.9, 4.5, 2.1,
and 5.0 kcal/mol, corresponding to TS-1-O3, TS-1-O4′, TS-2-O4′,
and TS-3-O4′, respectively. In these transition states, the
H atom of the O3/O4′–H bond is located approximately
midway between the O3/O4′ and the O atom of the CH3OO• radical. The H···OOCH3 and O3/O4′···H distances are in the ranges
of 1.21–1.31 and 1.09−1.17 Å, respectively (as
shown in Figure 5).
In the next step, the relative energies of the second intermediates
named Int2-1-O3, Int2-1-O4′, Int2-2-O4′, and Int2-3-O4′
are predicted to be about −9.5, −6.0, −4.1, and
−4.9 kcal/mol in comparison to the reactants. Finally, the
products are formed with relative energies equal to −0.7, 0.5,
−4.3, and 1.4 kcal/mol, respectively.

Figure 5 Optimized geometries
of the transition state corresponding to the
selected compounds and the CH3OO• radical.
Distances are reported in Å.

Moreover, activation (ΔG≠) and reaction (ΔG) Gibbs free energies and
rate constants (k) calculated for the reaction between
the studied compound and the CH3OO• radical
are summarized in Table 3. Analyzing the data from Table 3 shows that the reactions of CH3OO• with the O4′–H bonds of compounds 1 and 3 are not favorable due to the high activation Gibbs free
energies at 13.8 and 14.7 kcal/mol, respectively, and the almost positive
values of Gibbs energies (−0.13 and 0.85 kcal/mol). However,
the reaction of 1-O3–H and 2-O4′–H with CH3OO• following the HAT mechanism is supported
by the lower ΔG≠ values (11.5
kcal/mol) and negative ΔG values from −1.08
to −4.05 kcal/mol. It is noticing that the rate constants of
the 1-O3–H + CH3OO• reaction (k = 9.64 × 104 M–1 s–1) are lower than that of the 2-O4′–H
+ CH3OO• reaction (k = 3.61 × 105 M–1 s–1) despite of the same ΔG≠ values of for both the reactions. That is because of the different
tunneling corrections (the κ for 1-O3–H site is 4.3,
compared with 15.6 for the 2-O4′–H) (Table S3). In Table 3, it is clearly observed that the reaction between 2-O4′–H
and CH3OO• has the highest rate constant
(k = 3.61 × 105 M–1 s–1). Comparing with the typical antioxidant butylated
hydroxytoluene (BHT) (k = 13.85 × 105 M–1 s–1), the radical-scavenging
efficiency of compound 2 is almost similar to that of
the BHT. From the above analysis, the results propose that compound 2 has the highest free-radical-scavenging activity in the
investigated compounds because of the lower Gibbs free energies and
higher rate constants.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, thermodynamic and kinetic calculations were applied
to explore the diglycoside substituent effect on the antioxidative
capability of isorhamnetin extracted from A. roxburghii. Several conclusions are drawn as follows

Thermodynamic descriptors
including BDE, IE, PDE, PA, and ETE have
been used to evaluate the radical-scavenging action of the studied
compounds through three main antioxidant pathways (HAT, SET-PT, and
SPLET) both in the gas phase and in solution. The achieved results
prove that the HAT action is thermodynamically preferred in the gas
phase and SPLET is more preferred in water.

The influence of
the diglycoside substituent on the stabilization
of radicals has been analyzed through electron spin density and intramolecular
hydrogen bond. The glucose groups in 3 and 5′ sites of isorhamnetin
have greatly impacted the stabilization of 2-O4′ radical and
thus the lower BDE (75.3 kcal/mol in the gas phase).

The potential
energy surfaces of reactions between the studied
compounds and the CH3OO• radical have
been investigated in detail. It is mentioned that reactions of CH3OO• into the O4′–H bonds of
compound 2 are more favorable than other reactions with
the lower Gibbs free energies (−4.05 kcal/mol) and higher rate
constants (3.61 × 105 M–1 s–1). Thus, this result suggests that compound 2 has the highest antioxidant activity in all of the studied
compounds.

4 Computational Methods
In this study,
all of the calculations were carried out using the
Gaussian 09 software package.36 The geometry
optimizations and the vibrational frequency calculations of the studied
compounds and their radicals, cationic radicals, and anions were performed
at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of the theory.37,38 The transition states, intermediates, and products of the reaction
between the CH3OO• radical and the studied
molecules were optimized and calculated at the same level of theory.
The transition state for each reaction was confirmed by having single
imaginary frequency. In addition, the intrinsic reaction coordinate
(IRC) calculation was also performed to ensure each transition state
connects to the expected reactant and product. To estimate the solvent
effect on the enthalpies, the integral equation formalism of the polarizable
continuum model was used for this system.39,40

The thermodynamic parameters related to the three major radical-scavenging
mechanisms were determined according to the following formula41,42 1   2   3   4   5  where H(ArOH), H(ArO•), H(ArO–), and H(ArOH•+) denote the enthalpy
of the neutral, radical, anion, and radical cation forms of flavonoids,
respectively. The enthalpy of the hydrogen atom (H•) was calculated at the same model chemistries. The enthalpy values
for protons (H+) and electrons (e–) in
the gas phase were taken from the literature.43−47 Proton and electron solvation enthalpies were calculated
according to an approach recommended in previous studies.48 All reaction enthalpies defined in eqs 1–5 were calculated at 298.15 K and 1.0 atmosphere pressure.

All
rate constants (k) were estimated in the gas
phase by the conventional transition state theory (TST) and 1 M standard
state as  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, h is the Planck constant, R is the gas
constant, ΔG# is the Gibbs free
energy of activation, σ is the reaction symmetry number that
represents the number of different but equivalent reaction pathways
that are possible, and κ accounts for tunneling corrections,
which are calculated through the Wigner49 and Eckart50 approaches. All kinetic
calculations were carried out with the Eyringpy code.51,52 The calculation of AIM analyses was carried out at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
level using the AIM2000 program.53
