Sustainable
synthesis of Ni–Al double-layered catalysts
by the coprecipitation method is described. Synthesized double-layered
catalysts have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier
transform infrared, and thermogravimetric analyses, which confirmed
a hydrotalcite-like structure. In addition, the impact of aging time
and temperature on the activity of catalyst has been investigated.
Furthermore, it has been confirmed by SEM and TEM analyses that the
recovered catalyst has retained its structure. It has also been observed
that the prepared material has potency to catalyze the reaction without
loss in the yield. To explore the reactivity of the material, the
catalyst has been examined in the synthesis of N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
under solvent-free conditions. The overall process afforded the product
with high purity and high yields within short time.

1 Introduction
Double-layered nanocatalysts consist of a cationic brucite layer
and anionic compounds in the interlayer1 with stable active sites. Double-layered nanocatalysts have unique
properties such as recyclability, effective dispersion, safe in handling, separability, and friendliness.2 Hydrotalcite (HT)-like materials have formula
[M(II)1–xM(III)x(OH)2]x+[(An–)x/n·yH2O]x− in which MII and MIII represent a divalent
metal cation and a trivalent metal cation, respectively, An– represents the interlayer anion, x is the molar ratio of MIII/(MII + MIII), and y is the molar volume of the intercalated water.3 Hydrotalcite-derived metal oxides have exhibited high thermal
stability, large metal surface areas, and uniformity of the active
species.4−7 Herein, the reasons for selecting Ni and Al are the lower price
and availability of nickel and aluminum compared to those of other
noble metals.8 In hydrotalcite-derived
materials, Ni–Al-like material having interaction between NiO
and Al2O3 resultant, NiO was reduced at
higher temperature.9

Benzamide derivatives
exhibit biological activities such as antihelmintic,
antifungal, antihistaminic, and antibacterial activities.10−14 Oxyclozanide (benzamide structure) was discovered in 1969 as an
antihelminthic agent for the treatment of liver fluke infection. For
the synthesis of benzamide, many catalysts are routinely used. Pasha
et al.15 have reported a trace amount of
zinc dust, and Moghadam et al.16 have reported
zirconyl triflate, pyridine, triethyl amine, and sodium hydride.17−20 However, catalysts that have been used for amide synthesis suffer
many drawbacks such as the requirements of harsh conditions, exclusive
reagents, long time duration, elevated temperature, and higher loading
of catalyst; unwanted impurity generation; and thermal and hygroscopic
unsteadiness of reagents. As a result, an efficient methodology is
required for the preparation of benzamide. Chemoselective access is
an alternative for cost reduction by preventing unwanted impurities,
which have an immense importance in organic reactions.21 However, the reaction of a particular functional
group selectively toward synthesizing highly reactive reagents is a challenging
endeavor.22

In the present work,
we describe the synthesis, characterization,
and catalytic activity of Ni–Al hydrotalcites as heterogeneous
catalysts in chemoselective synthesis of N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
with high yield under solvent-free conditions. In this study, we have
prepared and screened different hydrotalcites for chemoselective synthesis
of benzamide. This is the first report on the synthesis of benzamide
using Ni–Al hydrotalcite as a heterogeneous catalyst. The coprecipitation
method has been employed for the preparation of Ni–Al hydrotalcites
having molar ratio of 3.0 and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric (TG), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses.23−29

In continuation of these studies, herein, we report a sustainable
synthesis and characterization of a Ni–Al hydrotalcite material
with good catalytic activity and recyclability (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of N-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Catalyst
Figure 1 shows the
powder
XRD pattern of Ni–Al hydrotalcite (HT) after being reduced. The characteristic diffraction pattern of the
synthesized hydrotalcite (HTlc)-like layered structure has shown hydrotalcite
(HTlc) precursors, which were successfully synthesized. Apparent diffraction
peaks at 7.83, 3.90, and 2.61 Å are observed, which are corresponding
to the diffraction lattice planes (003), (006), and (009), respectively.30 Diffraction patterns have interlayer lattice
distance “c” of 23.93 Å, and basal
reflections are recorded at 8.11, 3.94, and 2.59 Å (c = 24.33 Å) for the hydrothermally treated sample NiAl-HT. On
the other hand, the diffraction is recorded at 1.530 Å (a = 3.06 Å) because of planes (110).

Figure 1 XRD pattern of the synthesized
double-layered nanocatalyst.

FT-IR spectra are depicted in Figure 2. FT-IR analysis of Ni–Al hydrotalcite
was performed to identify the interlayer anions. Ni–Al–NO3– exhibits a broad band at around 3480 cm–1, which is attributed to the OH-stretching. The band
at around 1380 cm–1 is assigned to the NO3– anion. A small band is observed at 1718 cm–1, which is assigned to the C=O vibration close
to the bending vibration of water at 1615 cm–1.30

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of the synthesized double-layered nanocatalyst.

The TG curve of Ni–Al hydrotalcite
shows mass loss in three
steps, corresponding to three endothermic peaks (Figure 3). TG analysis of the double-layered
Ni–Al nanocatalyst demonstrated 10% weight loss up to 150 °C,
corresponding to the broad endothermic effect with the elimination
of water, physically absorbed on the external surface of the particles.31 A further decrease in weight of about 7% observed
above 200 °C may be attributed to the removal of water from the
brucite layer.32 In the third peak, 9%
of mass loss was found up to 800 °C.

Figure 3 TG spectra of the double-layered
nanocatalyst.

Figure 4 shows the
typical SEM image of Al–Ni–NO3– hydrotalcite. It has been observed that the particles are found
with almost spherical aggregates of hexagonal plateletlike sheets.33 When XRD analysis of hexagonal (analyzed by
SEM) Ni–Al hydrotalcite was performed, XRD has shown characteristic
results, which confirmed the Ni–Al hydrotalcite-like structure.
This observation by SEM and XRD is in good agreement and confirmed
the hydrotalcite-like structure.34

Figure 4 SEM image of
the double-layered fresh
nanocatalyst (A) at 10 μm and (B) at 2 μm and of (C) recovered
catalyst at 10 μm.

The morphology of Ni–Al hydrotalcite was examined
by TEM
analysis, and micrographs are shown in Figure 5. Reduction of Ni–Al hydrotalcite results in round-shaped
nanoparticles of Ni, despite a higher loading of NiO. Size distribution
of Ni nanoparticles was narrow with a mean size of 4 nm obtained by
the Scherrer equation, which confirmed that the Ni–Al HT precursor
produced a well-dispersed Ni-HT catalyst.35 The crystallite size obtained by the Scherrer equation is listed
in Table 1. In the
XRD pattern, the characteristic diffraction peak at 48° (2θ
value) can be indexed to the (110) plane of face-centered cubic Ni.36 These observations by TEM and XRD are in good
agreement and confirm the Ni–Al hydrotalcite structure with
good dispersion of Ni. The literature has also confirmed the good
dispersion of Ni nanoparticles in Ni-containing solid catalysts by
TEM and XRD analyses.37

hydrotalcite fresh catalyst at (A)

Crystallinity of the catalyst can be affected by hydrothermal
aging.
Cavani et al. have discussed some aspects of the hydrothermal treatment
of hydrotalcite-like compounds.4 The hydrothermal
treatment was also applied to improve the crystallinity of some layered
double hydroxides (LDHs) containing nickel: Ni–Al and Ni–Cr,32 Ni–Al–Cr and Ni–Al–Fe,33 and Ni–Fe.34 The hydrothermal treatment of Ni–Al LDHs using microwave
heating was also reported.35,36 A longer aging time
was in favor of an increase in the crystallinity, resulting in good
catalytic activity.37 At different aging
times, crystallite size has been calculated using XRD. Results of
XRD analysis have been given in Table 1. Initially, at 0 h, poor crystallinity was observed,
which has improved at 3.0 h and at 110 °C. A marked increase
of the LDH crystallite size (calculated using Scherrer’s formula)
was observed after 6–9 h. To confirm the crystallinity, scanning
electron microscopy has also been carried out, which showed a well-defined
platelet and layered structure. As shown in Figure 6, crystallinity was low at 0 h aging time.
Increment in crystallinity was found further at 110 °C temperature
for 3 h (hydrothermal treatment temperature), which increased sharply
at 6–9 h. Results of the hydrothermal treatment have shown
increment in the crystallinity of the HTlc Ni–Al sample. From
the results, it is clear that the aging time and temperature have
an impact on the crystallinity of hydrotalcite because of the increase
in the crystallite size on increasing the aging time at 110 °C.
The catalyst that was aged at 9.0 h showed good catalytic activity
in chemoselective synthesis and was used in the present study. Results
showed that crystalline nature improved the catalytic activity of
the catalyst and showed excellent yield in chemoselective synthesis
of benzamide.

2.2 Chemistry
We report a study on the
reaction between benzoyl chloride and 2-aminophenol to obtain N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide in the presence of a double-layered
catalyst (Scheme 1).
Initially, to optimize the reaction conditions, the reaction of benzoyl
chloride and 2-aminophenol was carried out with different catalysts
(Table 2). The influence
of bases such as Al(OH)3, Ca(OH)2, Al(NO3)3·H2O, and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was examined. It is clear that excellent
yield was obtained with double nanocatalyst (Ni–Al–NO3–) (Table 2, entry 4). The catalyst Al–Co–Cl– showed moderate yield as compared to that with remaining
base catalysts.

Next,
to optimize the amount of catalyst, the reaction of benzoyl
chloride and 2-aminophenol was studied under solvent-free conditions
in the presence of the double-layered catalyst (Ni–Al–NO3–). Table 3 showed that when the concentration of catalyst was
increased from 0.02 to 0.1 g, the yield also increased (99%). However,
there was no significant impact of a higher concentration of catalyst
(0.15 g) on the yield and reaction time. Hence, it could be concluded
that 0.1 g of catalytic amount was optimal.

We also examined the effect
of temperature and time. As shown in Table 4, excellent yield
was obtained at 60 °C, which decreased at lower temperature.
It has been shown that a temperature of 60° is suitable to perform
the reaction. From Table 4, the best yield was observed at 30 min, which decreased with
reaction time. Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimum time
for completion of the reaction is 30 min. Substituted benzamides have
been synthesized under optimized reaction conditions with excellent
yield. The yield of target products (range 89–99%) has been
mentioned in Table 5, which shows no impact of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing
groups.

Substituted N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzamides
(3a–h) have been synthesized successfully.
Compounds 3a–d were characterized by reported
melting points and spectral data (mass, IR, 1H, and 13C NMR). The compound 3a is known in the literature,
and the identity of this compound was confirmed by the comparison
of melting point. The IR spectra showed a strong absorption at 1710
cm–1, which can be ascribed to the C=O group.
The IR band at ≈3300 cm–1 confirmed the O–H
stretch, and a stretch band has been found at 1516 cm–1 because of the N–H stretch of the amino group. The 1H NMR spectra showed a characteristic singlet of methoxy proton (−OCH3) at δ 3.81, and other protons of phenyl moieties appeared
in the aromatic region δ 8.11–6.96. The characteristic
peaks appeared at 10.65 and 9.52 ppm for O–H and N–H,
respectively. The wagging band at 1300 cm–1 has
confirmed a chlorine group in 3c, and the stretching
bands at 1517, 1347, and 852 cm–1 have been assigned
to the NO2 group in product 3b. The bands
at 2950, 2835, 1247, and 2000–1650 cm–1 (overtone combination region)
confirmed the methoxy group in compound 3d.

The
reusability and effectiveness are the key features of the catalytic
activity for industrial and commercial applicability. The catalyst
has been reused successfully without loss of significant yield of
the target product. The recovered catalyst has been characterized
by SEM (Figure 5C)
and TEM images (Figure 6C), which confirmed that the catalyst has retained its structure
after recyclability. XRD data of recovered hydrotalcite also showed
a profile similar to the one of the fresh catalyst, which confirmed
that the layered structure of hydrotalcite was maintained after the
reaction (Figure 7).

3 Conclusions
We have developed a Ni–Al
double-layered catalyst for the
chemoselective synthesis of N-2(hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
derivatives using 2-aminophenol and benzoyl chloride with excellent
yield in short reaction time under solvent-free conditions. The morphology
and characterization of the catalyst were confirmed by XRD, IR, TG,
SEM, and TEM analyses. XRD analysis demonstrated diffraction patterns
that confirmed the hydrotalcite structure. TG analysis (TGA) and IR
analysis have been performed to identify the interlayer anions and
confirmed the structure. The effect of aging time at 110 °C has
been investigated, and it was found that aging time has affected the
particle size of the nanomaterial and high crystallinity was achieved.
It was observed that crystallinity was increased after hydrothermal
aging, which was confirmed by SEM and XRD. Results have shown that
aging effect and cystallinity increased with increasing aging time.
The morphology of the Ni–Al catalyst has been confirmed by
TEM, which showed round-shaped Ni nanoparticles, despite higher NiO
loading. The results show good catalytic activity of the double-layered
catalyst in the synthesis of N-2(hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
derivatives as compared to that of simple metal catalysts. It was
found that the recycled catalyst retain its structure and activity,
which were also confirmed by SEM and TEM. The present protocol involves
the operational simplicity, short reaction time, simple catalyst system,
excellent yield, and solvent-free conditions.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 General
All reagents were of analytical
grade, and 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Avance II 400 NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 and
DMSO-d6 as solvent. The purity of the
compound was checked by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Melting points
were determined in an open capillary and are uncorrected.

4.2 Characterization Techniques
Prepared
catalysts were confirmed by FT-IR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),
SEM, and TG analyses. PXRD patterns were obtained using a Philips
X’Pert MPD system, operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. A PerkinElmer
FT-IR spectrometer (model FT-1730) has been used for recording FT-IR
spectra. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) has been performed on Mettler
TGA/SDTA 851e and the data was processed using STARe software under
60 mL/min nitrogen flow rate. Leo series VP 1430 SEM was used to obtain
high-resolution images of catalysts. Ni morphology was investigated
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a Philips microscope. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance II 400 NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvent.

5 Experimental
Section
5.1 Preparation of Hydrotalcites
Aluminum-
and nickel-containing double-layered nanomaterials (ratio 1:3) were
synthesized by charging 1 M solution of NaOH (1 mL/min charging rate)
in a mixture of 0.1 M AlNO3·H2O (2.31 g)
and 0.3 M NiNO3·6H2O (8.72 g) until the
pH was adjusted to a range of 10–11. Afterward, a slurry was
observed with crystallized particles at this pH, which was further
stirred for 2 h under heating. Then, the slurry was cooled and the
precipitate were filtered followed by washing with 500 mL of deionized
water. The wet solid was dried at 100 °C in air oven for 24 h.

5.2 Synthesis of N-(2-Hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
To a round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer were
added benzoyl chloride (0.108 g, 1 mmol), 2-aminophenol (0.15 mL,
1.3 mmol), and the prepared catalyst (0.10 g). The resulting mixture
was heated at 60 °C. Reaction completion has monitored by TLC
analysis (ethyl acetate/hexane as a solvent; 1:4 ratio, respectively).
After completion of reaction that was monitored by TLC, the reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature. Then, acetone was added followed
by filtration to obtain N-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide
as the target product.
