Chitosan–citric biomembranes Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0–3) were prepared
by a simple cross-linking. The dependence of mechanical property,
water-resisting capacity, microstructural characteristic, oxygen barrier
ability, and thermal properties of membranes on the content of glycerin
was investigated. The results revealed that vacuum drying at 80 °C
can lead to low-yield amidation and the Maillard reaction, thus affecting
the thermal stability and water resistance of biomembranes. Owing
to the ionic cross-linking and amidation, the chitosan–citrate
complex showed weaker compatibility when the glycerin content increased,
thereby leading to discontinuity of microstructure in the Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3) membranes, which
was in line with the weaker mechanical properties and water-resisting
abilities of membranes, compared to Ch-CA-G0. Chitosan
membranes showed interestingly high oxygen barrier capabilities under
40 and 80% relative humidity (RH) conditions, probably attributed
to the increased diffusion length arising from the hydrogen-bonding,
ionic, and covalent cross-linking. The oxygen transmission rates of Ch-CA-Gx were below 0.1 cm3 m–2 day–1 at 40% RH. The Ch-CA-Gx membranes showed a good elasticity assigned to
the reversibly cross-linked structure. The membranes presented strong
antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria, probably
owing to the citric acids. The results demonstrated that these materials
have potential applications as membranes or protecting coatings for
food packaging and successful cross-linking by means of amidation,
and the Maillard reaction under the condition of vacuum drying can
be probably applied as a green and alternative method for the fabrication
of mechanically tough and antibacterial membranes, fibers, and gels.

1 Introduction
Chitosan (Ch) has been intensively
investigated in the fields of biomedicines, elastic hydrogels, water
treatment, biomembranes, and active food packaging, owing to the nontoxicity,
biodegradation, biocompatibility, and the inherent antibacterial ability
against the pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.1−4 Antibacterial
packaging materials doped by chitosan have shown excellent thermosealability,
microwavability, optical properties, and antimicrobial activities
against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria.5,6 However,
the poor oxygen barrier property and weak water-resisting ability
limited the composite films consisting of chitosan as host material
in the development of commercial products as coated layer over foods
or packaging materials.7,8 The water- and oxygen-barrier
characteristics of packaging membrane were influenced by many factors
such as the macromolecular structure, morphology, additives, cross-linked
network, and so on. Recently, cross-linking by means of covalent and
salt bonds has been considered as an effective method to enhance the
water-resisting capacities of chitosan-based films.9−12 Glutaraldehyde,
genipin, and tripolyphosphate are generally used as cross-linkers.13

Recently, citric acid (CA) as ionic cross-linker
has been widely explored because of the excellent biocompatibility
in membranes, fibers, and micro/nanogels.14−16 Citric acid, which is used as a food flavoring
agent, presented excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant properties.
By means of thermocompression molding, chitosan biomembranes with
high strength and antibacterial ability can be successfully fabricated
by utilizing citric acid as a biodegradable plasticizer.17 Antibacterial membranes using chitosan and cholinium
citrate as materials were successfully prepared by Galvis-Sánchez
et al.18 Möller et al. fabricated
a series of antimicrobial chitosan–citric membranes by solution
casting methods, utilizing NaH2PO4 as amidation
catalyst.7 Guerrero et al. reported sustainable
chitosan films through thermocompression molding and utilization of
citric acid as a covalent linker.19 However,
covalent cross-linking by means of amidation was mainly assigned to
thermocompression at high temperature and chemical catalyst in the
above-mentioned film preparation, and the investigation of the catalyst-free
amidation reaction is still lacking in the cross-linked chitosan–citric
film preparation. Cui et al. reported an effective and catalyst-free
modification of chitosan films by means of citric acid for increased
water-resisting capacity in high-temperature drying.20 Nowakowska et al. demonstrated that water-soluble chitosan-Rose
Bengal photosensitizers can be successfully synthesized by means of
catalyst-free amidation reaction between amino and carboxyl groups
under the conditions of 80 °C and vacuum. Catalyst-free amidation
reaction provided a green and alternative method for cross-linked
chitosan films, fibers, and hydrogels using citric acid as cross-linker.21,22 The different processing methods for cross-linked films can probably
endow them with versatile physical properties in the aspects of mechanical
properties, water-resisting capabilities, and oxygen barrier characteristics.

For this purpose, the aims of the present research are (i) to explore
practicability of the temperature-dependent and catalyst-free amidation
in vacuum for the preparation of cross-linked chitosan–citric
film; (ii) to investigate the dependence of microstructure, mechanical
properties, water vapor permeability (WVP), thermal stability, and
oxygen barrier ability of chitosan–citric membranes on the
content of glycerin (G); and (iii) to assess the antibacterial capabilities
of chitosan–citric membranes against Staphylococcus
aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria for potential packaging applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization of Ch-CA-Gx Membranes
The interactions between the
citric acids and the primary amine groups of chitosan readily caused
the formation of chitosan–citrate complex.14 The general procedure to fabricate chitosan–citric
membranes Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0–3) is described in Figure 1. As reported in some previous works, acetic acid was
frequently utilized as a solubilizer for chitosan through ammonium
acetate in film preparation using citric acid as cross-linker.7 However, ammonium acetate and amides attributed
to the dehydration of ammonium acetate in film preparation under the
condition of thermocompression at high temperature or chemical catalyst
can probably reduce the possibility of ammonium citrate, thus leading
to lower ionic cross-linking and amidation. Therefore, citric acid
was utilized as the solubilizer and cross-linker in the absence of
acetic acid in our work, and the chitosan powder can be dissolved
thoroughly in water at the ratio of 2.5/4 (weight ratio, w/w). A vacuum
drying oven was set at temperatures of 100, 80, 60, and 40 °C
to evaluate the temperature dependence of amidation and the Maillard
reaction. To further confirm that citric acids were grafted to the
chitosan chain by means of the amide bonds, the model polymer was
synthesized for comparison with Ch-CA-Gx films. The model polymer was obtained as a white solid, which was
very well soluble in 1% acetic acid aqueous solution, and the synthesis
route is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1 Preparation process of cross-linked Ch-CA-Gx membranes.

Figure 2 Synthesized route of model polymer using 3-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC) as catalyst.

The bands assigned to the N–H bending vibrations
of unprotonated amines, amide II, and amide I for chitosan powder
peaked at around 1573, 1550, and 1648 cm–1, respectively,
as reported by Lawrie et al.23 The Ch-CA-Gx spectrum showed a broad band peaked
at around 3400 cm–1 attributed to the stretching
vibrations of O–H and N–H, and two small bands centered
at 2941 and 2878 cm–1 assigned to C–H stretching
vibration, as shown in Figure 3. Before vacuum drying at 80 °C, ionically cross-linked Ch-CA-Gx membranes represented the bands
centered at around 1615 and 1512 cm–1, which are
mainly attributed to the antisymmetric −NH3+ deformation and the symmetric −NH3+ deformation, respectively, as suggested by Lawrie et al.23 After vacuum drying at 80 °C, the amide
I band of chitosan powder without chemical modification at the peak
of 1648 cm–1 disappeared in the Ch-CA-Gx spectrum, and the bending vibrations of N–H
corresponding to unprotonated primary amines at around 1575 cm–1 were very obvious in the membranes. The shoulder
at around 1534 cm–1 probably corresponded to the
overlapping band between N–H bending vibrations of amide II
and the symmetric deformation of −NH3+. The shoulder at 1623 cm–1 was arising from the
bands for N–H bending vibrations of amide I and the antisymmetric
−NH3+ deformation. In addition, the small
bands peaking at 1374 cm–1 assigned to the C–N
of amide III were observed. The C=O stretching characteristic
bands with the peak at around 1700 cm–1 corresponding
to citric acid were also observed in the Ch-CA-Gx films. The spectrum indicated that no ester bonds peaked
at around 1730 cm–1. The 13C NMR measurements
of chitosan–citric films showed no signals corresponding to
the carbonyl groups of amide. In this work, Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy failed to clearly identify the possible amidation
between citric acid and chitosan, owing to the spectrum overlapping
between the bands corresponding to the −NH3+ deformation and amide. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) N 1s narrow scans of chitosan–citric membranes can probably
be utilized to evaluate the degree of amide bonds.23 From the XPS data of films shown in Figure 4, the amidation extent of amine groups after
the deduction of the degree of acetylation in raw material chitosan
(around 9%) was about 5%, indicating the occurrence of the amidation
reaction in Ch-CA-G0 and Ch-CA-G1 under
vacuum at 80 °C in low yield.

drying at 80 °C.

Figure 4 Curve fit of XPS N 1s narrow scans of chitosan
powder (a), Ch-CA-G0 (b), Ch-CA-G1 (c),
and model polymer (d).

The 1H NMR spectra
of model polymer showed the signals of citric acid in the range of
2.4–2.9 ppm, evidencing that CA was ionically or covalently
attached to the chitosan chains, as shown in Figure 5. XPS data showed about 19% acetylation degree
of amine groups, evidencing about 10% amidation. From the spectra
of model polymer, two peaks at around 1573 and 1530 cm–1 were observed, which was closely consistent with those of Ch-CA-Gx cross-linked membranes. The spectrum
of chitosan–citric membranes after extraction in methanol was
similar to that of the model polymer, indicating the existence of
amide bonds.24 The C=O stretching
band with a peak at around 1715 cm–1 corresponding
to citric acid and the band centered at about 1380 cm–1 corresponding to the C–N of amide III in chitosan–citric
membranes were observed after extraction.

model polymer in D2O containing 1% CD3COOD (b).

The transition from
colorless transparent to light brown membrane originated from the
temperature-dependent nonenzymatic Maillard reactions has been reported
by many researchers.18Ch-CA-Gx films will gradually change from colorless to light
brown when the temperature increased from 60 to 80 °C, then gradually
to dark brown at 100 °C, indicating the occurrence of the nonenzymatic
Maillard reactions. The ionic cross-linking by means of ammonium salt,
together with covalent cross-linking assigned to amidation and nonenzymatic
Maillard reactions, can probably enhance the water-resisting capabilities
of Ch-CA-Gx films.

2.2 Thermogravimetric Behaviors
The thermogravimetric
behaviors of Ch-CA-Gx membranes were
affected by plasticization and cross-linking, as shown in Figure 6. Normally, a weight
loss of the chitosan powder without chemical modification started
at around 250 °C because of the decomposition of crystallized
structures and the maximum rate of thermal decomposition occurred
at around 300 °C.17,18 The major peak for derivative
weight loss at around 300 °C corresponding to the decomposition
of crystalline structures nearly disappeared in the Ch-CA-G0 membrane. The interaction between citric acids and amino groups
of chitosan can disrupt the crystalline structure in chitosan. Three
major peaks were observed for Ch-CA-G0 at around 178,
216, and 366 °C in Figure 6, which probably corresponded to the decomposition of citric
acid and amorphous and cross-linked chitosan, respectively.18 However, with the increase in content of glycerol
in Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3),
the major peak at around 300 °C assigned to the degradation of
crystalline structures reappeared, probably reflecting the nonignorable
effect of glycerol on cleavage of chitosan crystalline structures
in the presence of citric acid. The weight loss at around 210–250
°C was associated with the weight loss of glycerol.24 The broad band in the range of 210–270
°C in Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3) was probably the overlapping band between decomposition
of glycerol and amorphous chitosan. The cross-linking improved the
heat-resisting capability of the chitosan, thus leading to around
50 °C higher maximum temperature of thermal decomposition for Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0–3),
in comparison to the original chitosan powder.

percentage and (b) derivative weight.

2.3 Mechanical Properties of the Cross-Linked
Films
Table 1 shows the tensile strength (TS) and elongation (E) of the cross-linked films. With the increase of glycerol concentration,
the TS and E decreased accordingly, and the films
became more extensible. The blend of G caused the decrease in mechanical
properties, probably due to the weakened hydrogen-bonding interaction
within the polysaccharide network. Concerning the Ch-CA-G0 film, the cross-linking structure assigned to the stronger hydrogen
bonding caused extensive interchain bonding and limited flexibility
of the film in the absence of glycerin.25−28

Strength; E, Elongation at Break), Water Vapor Permeability
(WVP), and Solubility Degree (S) of the Ch-CA-Gx Films Prepared by the in Situ Cross-Linking Strategy

The effect of
frequency on the storage modulus (G′) and
loss modulus (G″) of the membranes in the
range of 0.01–100 Hz is shown in Figure 7. The elastic behavior at low frequency (G′ > G″) and viscous behavior
(G′ < G″) at high
frequency can be observed in all samples, evidencing the occurrence
of a reversibly cross-linked network in membranes.29 Owing to the absence of glycerin in Ch-CA-G0, the values of G′ and G″ increased obviously in comparison to Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3), reaching the
maximum values of about 2 MPa (G′) and 1 MPa
(G″), respectively, and the crossover point
of G′ and G″ located
at lower frequency in Ch-CA-G0. The G′ and G″ values declined significantly
when the strain increased, as shown in Figure 7b. The strain-induced collapse was possibly
assigned to the breaking of physically or covalently cross-linked
points of the membranes. The G′ and G″ of the membranes decreased with increasing content
of glycerin, probably owing to the enhanced plasticization effect,
which is consistent with the change trend of the mechanical properties
as the glycerin loading increased.27 The
plateaus G′ of the membranes Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) are 4, 0.4,
0.2, and 0.05 MPa, respectively. When the materials were loaded, mechanical
responses of soft elasticity were observed. Figure 8 shows the shape recovery process of Ch-CA-G3. The original shape of membrane with a 9.5 cm length
was stretched to 14 cm (50% strain) at 23 °C, and the length
of the sample recovered instantly to 12.2 cm after removing the stress.
After 48 h, the length of the membrane recovered to 9.7 cm (2% strain).
Although the efficiency of elastic recovery is time dependent for
all samples, the recovery efficiency was around 100% under the condition
of one stretch. The cross-linked network arising from a large number
of hydrogen bonds and covalently cross-linked bonds was responsible
for the maintenance of the original shape in the stretched films.

membrane after 48 h (length = 9.7 cm) (d).

2.4 Water Vapor Permeability and Solubility Degree
The water vapor permeability (WVP) and solubility degree (S) of the films were considered as important indexes in
cross-linking degree and water resistance.30,31 The
WVP of Ch-CA-Gx membranes increased
with the loading concentration of glycerin. Increased G content in Ch-CA-Gx membranes caused a significant increase
in WVP, probably due to the stronger hydrophilicity of
G facilitating water migration through the membranes.7 The WVP value was 28.57, 35.87, 78.33, and 160.32 g m–2 day–1 for Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0–3), respectively.
According to previous reports,32 the chitosan
film and the cross-linked chitosan membranes using glutaraldehyde
and genipin as cross-linkers showed WVP values of around 835, 724,
and 684 g m–2 day–1, respectively,
using the ASTM method at 25 °C and 50% RH, which are higher than
the values of the Ch-CA-Gx composite
membranes. The water migration in packaging membrane is closely associated
with the hydrophilic and hydrophobic capacities of material and the
microscopic paths for the water migration. Compared to Ch-CA-G0, the higher WVP behavior of Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3) could be assigned to the modified
hydrophilic character of the film as well as the tortuous micropath
for the water migration in the presence of glycerin.33

Figure 9 shows the effect of dehydrated temperature on the solubility of
the Ch-CA-G0. The membranes dehydrated in 40 and 60 °C
under vacuum completely dissolved in water, but the membrane fabricated
at or above 80 °C retained about 45% weight after soaking in
water. These results indicated that the inter- and intramolecular
interactions by means of amidation and the Maillard reaction were
improved under vacuum drying at high temperatures, further affecting
the thermal stability and tensile strength of films, as suggested
by Coma et al.7 Water solubilities of composite
membranes are shown in Table 1. The solubility degree of composite membrane was 45.85, 52.65,
47.18, and 55.24 for Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0, 1, 2 and 3), respectively.

Figure 9 Effect of dehydrated temperature on the solubility degree
of Ch-CA-G0 (a) and the photo of the Ch-CA-G0 membrane (b).

Swelling degree
as high as 2000% has been reported for the pure chitosan in an acidic
environment. In comparison, chitosan microspheres grafted by poly(acrylamide)
or poly(acrylic acid) and cross-linked by means of glutaraldheyde
and tripolyphosphate exhibited swelling degree as low as 50%.12 The swelling degree was 18.77, 35.23, 83.87,
and 218.07% for Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3), respectively. This obvious difference was attributed
to the weaker intermolecular interactions with the increase of G concentration,
which was in line with the increased water vapor permeability when
glycerin content increased. The model polymer was completely soluble
in 1% acetic acid aqueous solution, but the Ch-CA-Gx membranes retained around 40% weight after 1 week soaking
in 1% acetic acid aqueous solution, further evidencing that the presence
of cross-linked bonds improved the water resistance of membrane matrix.

2.5 Film Morphology and Structure
The
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of membrane surfaces are
compared in Figure 10. When the percentage of glycerol increased in Ch-CA-Gx membranes, the distinctive morphological differences
were identified, indicating the non-negligible effect of the glycerol
content on microstructure. The nanoscale phase separation was clearly
observed in Ch-CA-G2 and Ch-CA-G3 samples.
The average roughness of surface in Ch-CA-Gx membranes (x = 1, 4.2 nm; x = 2, 8.5 nm; and x = 3, 16.9 nm) increased with
increasing glycerin content, as shown in Figure 11.

Figure 10 SEM images of Ch-CA-G0 (a1, a2), Ch-CA-G1 (b1, b2), Ch-CA-G2 (c1, c2), and Ch-CA-G3 (d1, d2) surface.

Figure 11 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) micrographs (80 × 80
μm2) of the surface of Ch-CA-G0 (a), Ch-CA-G1 (b), Ch-CA-G2 (c), and Ch-CA-G3 (d) membrane.

Citric acid was expected to form
ionically cross-linked chitosan–citrate complex. The particular
arrangement of chitosan chains can occur during vacuum drying, where
the hydrophobic polysaccharide skeleton oriented toward the surface
and the hydrophilic −NH3+ COO– groups oriented inward in the chitosan–citrate complex.7 Compared to the cationic chitosan acetate, the
relatively hydrophobic and cross-linked chitosan–citrate complex
was considered to have worse compatibility with glycerin, thus leading
to the discontinuity of membrane and obvious nanostructures in SEM.
The more serious phase separation with increased glycerin content
was in line with the change trend of the weaker mechanical and water-resisting
properties of membranes when glycerin content increased.

To
further visualize the microstructure, the Ch-CA-G0 sample
was immersed in water for 48 h. The sample got swollen and the unbound
citric acids got dissolved in water during the immersion. Nanoscale
chitosan–citrate particles consisting of cross-linked chitosan
chains were clearly observed on the surface and cross section part
of membrane, as shown in Figure 12. In addition, the freeze-died Ch-CA-G1 and Ch-CA-G3 samples after soaking in deionized water
for 48 h showed the obvious occurrence of nanoscale chitosan–citrate
particles. Recent studies associated with the micro- and nanoparticles
of chitosan concentrated on the application of the sodium tripolyphosphate
and sodium sulfate as cross-linkers.34 However,
few studies have explored the CA application in fabricating micro-
or nanostructure of chitosan in the fields of membranes, fibers, and
gels. Figure 13 shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Ch-CA-Gx membranes. The diffraction peak at about 19.6° corresponding
to the characteristic diffraction of crystallized chitosan without
chemical modification became very broad, indicating a decrease of
crystallinity. The results confirmed that the citric acid and glycerin
can efficiently reduce the crystallinity of chitosan–citric
membranes.24

section (b) of Ch-CA-G0. SEM images of freeze dying Ch-CA-G1 (c) and Ch-CA-G3 (d) surface after immersion

2.6 Oxygen Barrier Characteristics
The
oxygen permeability (OP) of cross-linked membranes was evaluated under
40 and 80% relative humidity, as shown in Table 2. The oxygen permeability of Ch-CA-G0 at 40% RH was 23.73 cm3 μm m–2 day–1, which slightly increased to 28.80 cm3 μm m–2 day–1 at
80% RH. In addition, the oxygen transmission rates (OTRs) for Ch-CA-G0 in different RH conditions showed similar values
(∼0.07 cm3 m–2 day–1), indicating that the cross-linked structure of unplasticized Ch-CA-G0 can reduce the moisture sensitivity. However, the
plasticized Ch-CA-Gx (x = 1–3) presented obvious moisture sensitivity with increase
of glycerin content. The OTR value of Ch-CA-G1 increased
from the value below detection limit to 0.07 cm3 m–2 day–1 when the RH raised from 40
to 80%. The OTR value of Ch-CA-G3 at 80% RH (∼0.79
cm3 m–2 day–1) showed
a significant improvement relative to the value at 40% RH (∼0.07
cm3 m–2 day–1). The
results were consistent with the dependence of WVP, swelling degree,
and mechanical properties on the glycerin extent. For Ch-CA-Gx membranes, their OTR results at 40% RH were comparable
to those of some high oxygen barrier membranes based on synthetic
polymers, such as polyamide (PA) and poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC)
(around 40 and 26.5 cm3 m–2 day–1 at 23 °C and 0% RH in 25 μm thickness, respectively).
High oxygen barrier capacities of membranes were probably assigned
to the strong attractive interactions occurring through hydrogen-bonding,
ionic, and covalent cross-linking, thus increasing the diffusion length
for oxygen,35−40 as shown in Figure 14. Xiang et al. successfully made a stretchable gas
barrier thin film by means of hydrogen-bonding assemblies between
poly(ethylene oxide) and tannic acid.41 The oxygen barrier and elasticity properties for the application
in food packaging and protecting coating can also be improved through
CA-involved hydrogen-bonding, ionic, and covalent cross-linking in
the polymer matrix.

2.7 Antimicrobial Activity
To explore
the potential antimicrobial activity of membranes, antibacterial measurements
against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria were assessed by using a reference
method.33 As illustrated in Figure 15, complete inhibition of the
growth of E. coli and S. aureus bacterial can be observed. The polycationic
chitosan and citric acids were probably the bioactive compounds assigned
to the antibacterial abilities of the films. Considering the large
number of citric acids used in the membranes, it was necessary to
evaluate the bioactive properties of membranes after removing citric
acids which were uninvolved in ionic and covalent cross-linking. The
unbound citric acids can be removed by immersing membranes in water
for 2 weeks. Toward S. aureus, the
biocide activities of membranes declined after soaking in water, evidencing
that the antibacterial activity from membranes could partially be
attributed to the free citric acids, as shown in Figure 16.7 Colony counting showed that the killing efficiency of Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0, 1, 2, 3) membranes was
approximately 65, 51, 95, and 82%, respectively.

3 Conclusions
Chitosan–citric
biomembranes have been successfully prepared by a simple cross-linked
strategy under the condition of vacuum drying at 80 °C. The successful
cross-linking by means of amidation and the Maillard reaction under
the condition of vacuum drying can be probably applied as a green
and potential method for the fabrication of mechanically tough membranes,
fibers, and gels. The results demonstrated that the mechanical properties,
water resistance, microstructure, and oxygen barrier capabilities
of membranes showed strong dependence on the content of glycerin.
The vacuum drying at 80 °C can facilitate amidation and the Maillard
reaction in the membrane matrix, thus further improving their water
resistance. Chitosan membranes showed an interestingly high oxygen
barrier capability under 40 and 80% RH conditions, probably attributed
to the cross-linked structure formed by the strong interactions occurring
through hydrogen-bonding and covalent cross-linking. The OTR values
of Ch-CA-Gx were below 0.1 cm3 m–2 day–1 under 40% RH. The Ch-CA-Gx membranes exhibited good elasticity,
indicating the existence of the reversibly cross-linked network. The
membranes presented effective antimicrobial activities against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria. The results demonstrated the potential application of
these cross-linked materials as membranes or coatings for food packaging.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
The commercial chitosan
(Mw, 176 kDa) was purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. The deacetylation degree of chitosan powder
at 91% was determined by 1H NMR and XPS methods. Glycerin
with a purity of 99.0% (Beijing Huayitai Biotechnology Co., Ltd.),
citric acid with a purity of 99.5% (J&K Scientific Co., Ltd.),
and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC,
J&K Scientific) were utilized without purification. S. aureus and E. coli used for the antibacterial experiments were obtained from the School
of Food Science and Technology in Beijing University of Agriculture.

4.2 Preparation of the Ch-CA-Gx Membranes
The abbreviation Ch-CA-Gx (x = the volume of glycerin) was
adopted for the chitosan–citric films. As shown in Figure 1, the general procedure
for the fabrication of Ch-CA-G1 membrane is as follows:
citric acid (4.0 g) and glycerin (1 mL) were dissolved in deionized
water (100 mL). After thorough mixing, chitosan (2.5 g) was added
to the mixed solution at 40 °C for 4 h to ensure the dissolving
of chitosan. Then, the mixture was poured into a glass plate for film
casting and dried at 25 °C for 2 days. The dried film was placed
in a vacuum-drying oven for 12 h under the conditions of 80 °C
and vacuum degree of 0.1 atm to obtain Ch-CA-G1 film.
The glycerol weight corresponded to 50% of the weight of chitosan.
The chitosan/citric acid ratio stayed the same for all membranes at
2.5/4 (weight ratio, w/w). The procedures for preparing other membranes
were the same as described for Ch-CA-G1. The glycerol
weight corresponded to 50, 100, and 150% of the weight of chitosan
for Ch-CA-G1, Ch-CA-G2, and Ch-CA-G3. The temperature of the vacuum-drying oven was also set at 100,
80, 60, and 40 °C to evaluate the temperature dependence of amidation
and the Maillard reaction. The Ch-CA-Gx (x = 0–3) membranes were kept at 25 °C
and 50% RH for 72 h before their characterization.

4.3 Synthesis of the Model Polymer
Citric
acid can be successfully attached to the chitosan backbone to fabricate
the model polymer, according to the reference method.42 EDC (4.0 g) dissolved in 50 mL of solution containing deionized
water and ethanol (1:1, v/v) was slowly dropped to the deionized water
solution (50 mL) containing chitosan (2.5 g) and citric acid (4.0
g). The reaction mixture was stirred with pH value maintained at 5.0
at room temperature. After 12 h, the solution was dialyzed (molecular
weight cutoff: 3500, union carbide) in deionized water (pH 5.0) for
2 days and in deionized water for 4 h to clean out unbound CA. The
dialysis ended until no CA residue was detected by means of the electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectrum. The degree of amidation
at about 10% was determined by XPS and 1H NMR.

4.4 Instrumentation and Methods
1H NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker (300 M) spectrometer.
Sample was dissolved in D2O solution containing 1% CD3COOD. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were acquired
by means of a Nicolet 6700 spectroscopy analyzer in the scanning range
of 4000–400 cm–1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) survey was performed by a Thermo Fischer XPS spectrometer (ESCALAB
250Xi) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source operating at
12.5 kV and 16 mA. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was collected
from a TGA (SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20) thermogravimetric analyzer at
a 20 °C min–1 heating rate in the range of
20–600 °C. The surface images of the membranes were recorded
on an atomic force microscope (Oxford Cypher VRS, U.K.). Wide-angle
X-ray diffraction (WXRD) measurements were carried out by means of
a Rigaku RINT-2200V diffractometer at 20 °C and in reflection
mode, and the intensity profiles of diffraction were collected in
the range of 5–40°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
was applied to investigate the morphologies of surface and cross section
of dry films by means of scanning electron microscopy (JEOL Tsm-6700F,
JP). Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) testing was carried out by means
of the Oxtran 2/21 ML apparatus at 23 °C and 40 or 80% RH. The
mechanical properties were investigated by means of a texture analyzer
(MTS Criterion model C43.104). A 500 mm min–1 strain
rate was used in all experiments, and data were collected in triplicate
for each sample. A micrometer was utilized to assess membrane thickness
with an accuracy of 1 μm, and the mean thickness was determined
by 10 measurements for each sample. Viscoelastic measurements were
carried out by means of a Physica MCR302 (Anton Paar) rotary rheometer.
The frequency sweeps in viscoelastic analysis were carried out in
the range of 0.1–100 rad s–1 at 60 °C
with 0.1% elongation. Water vapor permeability (WVP) tests were carried
out by W303 water vapor transmission rate tester (GBPI Packaging Test
Instrument Co., China). The film samples with the diameter of 80 mm
were sealed on a water-containing permeation cell. The cell was placed
on a balance in a cavity equipped with a desiccator facilitating water
absorbance. The cell was weighed at different time intervals, and
the WVP value (g m–2 day–1) was
evaluated by the equation of WVP = Δm/AΔt, where Δm is the weight reduction (g) and A is the exposed
area (m2) for the time Δt (day)
at 37 °C. Swelling measurements were carried out in water. Swollen
hydrogels were weighed after they were taken out from the water and
wiped dry. The swelling percentage was calculated according to the
following equation: DS = [(Weq – Wd)/Wd] × 100%,
where Wd is the initial weight of the
dried membrane and Weq is the saturated
weight of membranes. The solubility was determined by comparison between
the residual weight (W1) of membranes
after soaking in water for 48 h and starting weight (W2) of membranes according to the equation S = [(W1 – W2)/W2] × 100%. All experiments
were conducted in triplicate at room temperature.

4.5 Antibacterial Assessment
Both sides
of the Ch-CA-Gx (x =
0–3) films were respectively sterilized under UV for 15 min.
The membrane was cut into round films with a diameter of 14 mm, and
round films were placed at the bottom of each well in a 24-well plate.
Bacterial fluid (50 μL) was inoculated on the surface of membranes
(105 CFU mL–1, CFU: colony-forming unit).
The bacterial fluid cultured in the well in the absence of chitosan–citric
membrane was considered as a control sample. Then, the plate was placed
in a constant-temperature incubator at 37 °C for 4 h. The membranes
with bacterial inoculated were washed using phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, 1 mL, pH 7.4) under the condition of ultrasonic treatment for
75 s. A bacterial solution (50 μL) was incubated for 24 h at
37 °C by Lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates. Viable counts were
estimated by the plate count technique in colony-forming units (CFU
mL–1), and all antibacterial experiments were carried
out in triplicate. The antibacterial rate (I) was
evaluated by the following equation: I (%) = [(N1 – N2)/N1] × 100%, where N1 is the colony count (CFU mL–1) in control
experiment and N2 is the colony count
in the presence of membranes (CFU mL–1).
