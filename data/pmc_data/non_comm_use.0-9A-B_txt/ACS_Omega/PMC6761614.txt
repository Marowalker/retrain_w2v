The ability of ultrasound contrast
agents to enhance the cell membrane
permeability in response to an ultrasound pulse has unveiled avenues
to facilitate the delivery of a higher intracellular payload at target
sites. In light of the above, we report the development of submicron-sized
(528.7 ± 31.7 nm) nanobubble-paclitaxel liposome (NB-PTXLp) complexes
for ultrasound imaging and ultrasound responsive drug delivery in
cancer cells. With a paclitaxel entrapment efficiency of 85.4 ±
4.39%, the 200 nm-sized liposomes tethered efficiently (conjugation
efficiency ∼98.7 ± 0.14%) with the nanobubbles to form
conjugates. Sonoporation of MiaPaCa-2 cells upon treatment with nanobubbles
and ultrasound enhanced cellular permeability, resulting in 2.5-fold
higher uptake of liposomes in comparison to only liposome treatment.
This manifested into more than 300-fold higher anticancer activity
of NB-PTXLps in the presence of ultrasound in MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, MDA-MB-231,
and AW-8507 cell lines, compared to commercial formulation ABRAXANE.
Also, the NB-PTXLp conjugates were found to exhibit echogenicity comparable
to the commercial ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue. In addition,
the developed nanobubbles were found to exhibit more than 1 week echogenic
stability as opposed to 6 h stability of the commercially available
ultrasound contrast agent SonoVue. Hence, the NB-PTXLps developed
herein could prove to be a promising and minimally invasive theranostic
platform for cancer treatments in the future.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
basic prerequisite for an effective cancer therapy is an on-demand
availability of the chemotherapeutic agent at the target site and
a low to negligible level of systemic toxicity. The success of conventional
cancer chemotherapy is limited by the nonspecificity and poor bioavailability
of the chemotherapeutic drug, culminating in undesirable side effects.1−6 A paradigm shift toward the usage of biocompatible and biomimetic
nanocarriers for drug delivery over the past decades partially combated
the above limitations by shielding the drug and decreasing the systemic
toxicity.7−11 Despite the availability of a broad range of nanocarriers, their
poor pharmacokinetics fails to address the issue of site-specific
bioavailability limiting their translation from bench to bedside.

The pursuit of precision medicine led to the exploration of triggers
for on-site application that can be tuned to stimulate an on-demand
release of therapeutic from the nanocarriers, enhancing site-specific
bioavailability.12−19 A broad range of triggers like heat, NIR radiation, magnetic waves,
ultrasound (US), pH, and enzymes are currently being evaluated for
development of trigger-responsive drug delivery systems (DDS).20−24 Additionally, with an objective to enable clinicians to visualize
the nanocarrier accumulation and therapeutic release at the target
site, an array of imaging probes are currently being developed which
can be incorporated into the trigger-responsive DDS.25−29 The advancements in imaging technologies like optical imaging, X-ray,
computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and US can leverage the potential
of the image-guided DDS not only for drug delivery but also to monitor
the post treatment changes at the site of application to assess the
progress of the treatment regimen.

US imaging is the most common
diagnostic imaging modality because
it is safe, affordable, and noninvasive and there is no risk of ionizing
radiation. However since the past few decades, US is also being explored
for drug delivery applications in addition to imaging. The underlying
basis of US therapy is US contrast agents (UCA) or microbubbles (MB)
which are gas-filled spheres composed of lipid, polymer, protein,
or their combination, ranging in size from 1 to 8 μm.30,31 Upon US application, these MBs undergo a controlled contraction
and expansion referred to as cavitation, reflecting the incident US
waves that are captured by the transducer probe and converted to an
image. Because the gas-filled MBs exhibit higher compressibility than
biological tissues, they reflect US more effectively than the tissues.
This enhances the contrast of the region of interest, a property well
known as echo reflection or echo enhancement.32 There have been consolidated efforts to stabilize MBs by the introduction
of a stabilizing shell and plasma-insoluble gases (SF6 and
perfluorocarbons) to enhance their residence time in the body as well
as enhance the US-reflecting ability.33

On the therapeutic front, the US-induced cavitation of MBs
in the
vicinity of biological cells was found to induce the formation of
temporary sonopores, resulting in an enhanced permeability which could
be exploited for site-specific US-responsive drug delivery.34 Additionally, the MB cavitation was also found
to have other biological effects like localized temperature increase,
reactive oxygen species generation, and stimulation of receptor-mediated
endocytosis.35,36 Several studies have also reported
the local extravasation of macromolecules and nanoparticles induced
by MBs in response to US.37 These developments
inspired the use of physical mixture MBs and chemotherapy drugs for
anticancer treatments. Commercial UCA formulation SonoVue was used
in combination with gemcitabine HCL for the treatment of pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).38 With a
view to reduce the systemic toxicity, drug-loaded MBs were developed;
however, the low surface area-to-volume ratio attributed to the micron
size of MBs limited their drug loading capacity.39 This would require administering either a high dose of
MBs or increasing the dosage frequency, consequently elevating costs.
In an attempt to increase the therapeutic payload, the MBs were coated
with drug-loaded nanocarriers to form pendant-shaped complexes.40 However the limitation of such an approach was
the micron size of the complexes that limited their extravasation
to the tumor site, reducing the overall therapeutic efficacy. Therefore
size reduction of MBs is currently the need of the hour because there
have been studies reporting the uptake of MBs by the reticulo-endothelial
system (RES) in a size-dependent manner.41 A reduction in size of the above stated complexes would be beneficial
not only for an unhindered passage through the capillary bed but also
for efficient extravasation through the leaky vasculature of the tumor,
enhancing their accumulation in the tumor interstitium via the enhanced
permeability and retention effect.

With a view to address the
limitations of the US-responsive DDS
cited above, herein we report the development of submicron-sized nanobubble-paclitaxel
liposome (NB-PTXLp) complexes as the theranostic platform for US imaging
and drug delivery in cancer cells. We hypothesize that the US-induced
cavitation of nanobubbles (NBs) would enhance the cancer cell permeability,
increasing the uptake of drug-loaded liposomes (Lps). The subsequent
enhancement of the intracellular therapeutic payload would manifest
into higher anticancer activity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of NBs
NBs were
prepared by the thin-film hydration method, wherein the lipid vesicles
formed post hydration were subject to purging of SF6 gas.
The bubble layer was seen floating on the top of the tubes (Figure 1A). Vigorous mixing
of the stabilized NBs restored the milky appearance to the entire
suspension, which when allowed to stand reseparated into the top layer
of NBs and bottom layer of clear and transparent phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), indicating the formation of a stable layer of NBs. Physicochemical
characterization revealed hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, and polydispersity
index (PDI) of the NBs to be 320 ± 30.2 nm, 9.3 ± 1.47 mV,
and 0.261 ± 0.07, respectively. The hydrodynamic size of the
NBs was found to be significantly lower as compared to the size of
the UCAs reported in the literature.39 A
nanometer size range for UCAs is beneficial, as it can facilitate
unhindered passage through the capillary bed and efficient extravasation
into the tumor interstitium via the leaky vasculature, where the size
of the tight junctions is typically between 100 and 780 nm.42 Additionally, it can also confer a long circulating
time to the NBs by escaping the size-dependant uptake by the RES.
Zeta potential is a measure of the colloidal stability of the nanoparticulate
formulation, wherein a higher magnitude is an indicative of interparticle
repulsive forces that prevent particle aggregation. The NBs were found
to have a positive charge on the surface as indicated by the zeta
potential. PDI is a measure of the heterogeneity of the colloidal
particulate system, where lower PDI values are desirable for a monodispersity
of the particulate suspension. A PDI value of 0.261 ± 0.07 for
NBs was found to be significantly lower as compared to that of the
commercial UCA formulation SonoVue,43 indicating
a monodisperse suspension of NBs (Figure S1). Transmission electron micrographs revealed particles with a spherical
architecture, and the size of the NBs was in agreement with the DLS
size (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs also revealed
the presence of characteristic pocket-shaped cavities which could
be attributed to the gas pockets of SF6. A time lapse imaging
of the NBs under the 200 kV electron beam for 1 min revealed a dynamic
coalescence of the pocket-shaped cavities, indicating the deflation
of the NB architecture under the high-energy electron beam (Figure 1D).

micrographs of [B] freshly prepared NBs and [C] reconstituted NBs

Reconstituted NBs were prepared
by injecting PBS into the sealed
vial containing lyophilized vesicles in an SF6-purged headspace.
Following vigorous shaking for efficient redispersion, the vesicles
were found to rise and form a compact mass of reconstituted NBs, similar
to that of freshly prepared NBs. The hydrodynamic size, zeta potential,
and PDI of the reconstituted NBs was found to be 383 ± 41.6 nm,
8.7 ± 1.1 mV, and 0.395 ± 0.1. The hydrodynamic size and
PDI of the reconstituted NBs were found to be marginally higher than
that of freshly prepared NBs, whereas the zeta potential was marginally
lower; however, the difference was not statistically significant.
This indicates that the reconstitution of the NBs does not significantly
alter their physicochemical properties in comparison to the freshly
prepared counterparts. This is essential for the long-term storage
of the freeze-dried formulation that can be reconstituted just prior
to usage. Additionally, the biocompatibility of the NBs was evaluated
on murine fibroblast cell line (L929), wherein cell viability greater
than 90% was observed for NB concentration as high as 100 μg/mL
(Figure S2), rendering them suitable for
further studies.

2.2 Characterization of Lps
1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) (9:1) Lps were also
prepared by the thin-film hydration method. Physicochemical characterization
(Table 1) revealed
the hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, and PDI to be 163.1 ±
10.65 nm, −6.8 ± 4.1 mV, and 0.18 ± 0.02, respectively.
Moreover, transmission electron micrographs also showed a monodisperse
population of spherical particles with diameters lesser than 200 nm
(Figure 2A), which
was in agreement with the DLS data. The zeta potential of the Lp suspension
indicated a negative surface charge, a factor that could enhance their
coupling efficiency with the positively charged NBs via electrostatic
interactions, in addition to covalent coupling. Additionally, the
biocompatibility of the LPs was evaluated on murine fibroblast cell
line (L929), wherein cell viability greater than 90% was observed
for Lp concentration as high as 100 μg/mL (Figure S2), allowing safe usage for further studies.

2.3 PTX Entrapment and Drug Loading
Drug-loaded
Lps were prepared by incorporation of paclitaxel (PTX), a potent microtubule
stabilizing anticancer drug,4445−47 into the hydrophobic shell of the Lps. Batches of Lps were prepared
by varying the concentration of PTX (lipid/PTX ratios—10:1,
15:1, and 20:1), and the amount of PTX incorporated was quantified
by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Figure 2E). The 10:1 batch was found to have PTX
entrapment of 77.4 ± 9.15% with a drug loading of 4.29 ±
0.5%. However, a visible leaching of PTX was observed upon being allowed
to stand for 15 min negating its use for further studies. Amongst
the other two combinations, the 15:1 batch was found to have a higher
entrapment efficiency and drug loading of 85.4 ± 4.39 and 4.98
± 0.25%, respectively, and hence taken ahead for further developments.
The hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, and PDI of the 15:1 PTX-loaded
liposomal batch was found to be 190.1 ± 19.4 nm, −6.5
± 3.7 mV, and 0.19 ± 0.04, respectively. Though a marginal
increase in the hydrodynamic size was evident in comparison to the
nondrug-loaded Lps, the difference was not statistically significant.
Additionally, a monodisperse population with a spherical morphology
and size ∼200 nm was observed in the transmission electron
micrographs of the PTX-loaded Lps (Figure 2C).

2.4 Development of Nanobubble/Liposome
Conjugates
The NBs and Lps were conjugated via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxy succinimide
(NHS) coupling by leveraging the 1° amine group of DOPE in liposome
and carboxylate group of stearic acid in NBs toward the formation
of an amide linkage. Fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-labeled Lps
and Nile red-loaded NBs were subject to conjugation using different
NB/Lp ratios (1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:10), and the conjugation efficiency
was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis (Figure 3D). Quantification of the double fluorescent
population revealed an increasing trend in conjugation efficiency
from 91.5 ± 0.23% in 1:2 batch to 98.7 ± 0.14% in 1:10 batch.
Though a high degree of conjugation efficiency (>90%) was observed
for all the four batches, the difference was not statistically significant.
However, in order to develop a formulation with the maximum PTX loading,
the 1:10 (NB/Lp) batch was chosen for further studies. The hydrodynamic
size, zeta potential, and PDI of the nanobubble-PTXliposome conjugates
(NB-PTXLp) were found to be 528.7 ± 31.7 nm, −7.1 ±
2.5 mV, and 0.55 ± 0.1, respectively. An expected increase in
the size of the conjugates was observed to be attributed to the tethering
of Lps on the surface of NB’s. Transmission electron micrograph
showed 200 nm size PTX Lps latched onto the surface of NB (Figure 3C), providing a visual
proof toward the formation of NB-PTXLp conjugates. The heterogeneity
of the conjugate system was also found to have increased in comparison
to the NBs and Lps as indicated by the PDI values. Development of
the NB-PTXLp conjugates with a size ∼500 nm is an important
benchmark in comparison to the micron size conjugates. The submicron
size would not only enable unhindered passage through the capillary
bed but also facilitate efficient extravasation from the leaky tumor
vasculature (tight junctions: 100–780 nm) into the tumor interstitium.
Moreover a submicron size of NB-PTXLp would also facilitate their
better proximity to the cancer cells enhancing the effects of cavitation
which are distance dependent, to induce a cell membrane permeability
and subsequent increase in the intracellular therapeutic delivery.

2.5 In Vitro PTX Release
PTX being a
hydrophobic drug has been known to exhibit slow and sustained release
from nanocarriers. From the release profile (Figure 4), it is evident that in the absence of an
US pulse, a sustained release of PTX from the NB-PTXLp was observed
up to 24 h, with ∼33% of the total entrapped PTX released at
the end of 48 h. However, in the US-treated group, a burst release
of PTX was observed within the first 8 h, consequently releasing ∼42%
of the total entrapped PTX at the end of 48 h which was 1.3-fold higher
that the non-US-treated group. The results indicate the beneficial
role of the applied US trigger in enhancing the release of PTX from
the NB-PTXLp conjugates.

conjugates in the
presence and absence of US at 37 °C.

2.6 In Vitro Echogenicity
Echogenicity
of the formulations was evaluated in a tissue mimicking phantom composed
of 1% agarose gel48 with embedded cylindrical
wells for sample loading (Figure 5A). Post sample loading, the echogenic response was
recorded in B-mode and contrast enhancement (CE) mode in the Philips
EPIQ-7G US assembly by scanning the 12–3 MHz probe on the anterior
surface of the agarose phantom. B-mode displays a signal for any material/region
capable of reflecting US. However, a CE mode signal is a specific
indication of harmonic signals, wherein the US frequency reflected
by the UCAs is an integral multiple of the incident US frequency.
No signal was obtained for the blank (PBS) and PTXLps because of their
inability to reflect the US waves. However, a strong signal was obtained
for NB, NB-PTXLps in both B and CE mode and was found to be equivalent
to the signal obtained for the commercial UCA SonoVue (positive control)
(Figure 5C). Interestingly,
the reconstituted NBs exhibited a 1.25-fold stronger signal in comparison
to SonoVue which was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) (Figure 5D). The strong signal in the CE mode was indicative of the
harmonic cavitation exhibited by NBs, NB-PTXLps and reconstituted
NBs. The comparable signal exhibited by NBs and NB-PTXLps is an indication
that tethering Lps onto the surface of NBs does not compromise the
imaging potential on NBs in the conjugate. Hence, a preliminary echogenicity
evaluation confirmed the strong echogenic potential of NBs, NB-PTXLps,
and reconstituted NBs.

analysis of CE mode signal exhibited by SonoVue (+ve control), NB,
NB-PTXLp, and reconstituted NB (ns—not significant, **p < 0.01).

To get finer insights
into the stability and cavitation behavior
of NBs and NB-PTXLps, a continuous echogenic response was evaluated
over a time span of 10 min (Figure 6). It was observed that the NBs exhibited a strong
and unaltered signal in the B-mode over the 10 min span; however,
the CE mode showed a strong signal up to the 6 min mark, beyond which
the signal was found to decrease gradually. Loss of the signal in
the CE mode could be attributed to the gradual lipid shedding from
the NB surface and subsequent leakage of SF6 under constant
insonation that compromises on their ability to reflect the harmonic
signals. On the other side, retention of a strong signal in B-mode
up to 10 min indicated that though the NBs were stable and capable
of reflecting US till the 10 min mark, their ability to reflect harmonics
was gradually weakened beyond the 6 min mark. A similar time point
evaluation of NB-PTXLps revealed a strong signal up to 10 min not
only in the B-mode but also in the CE mode, which was in contrast
to the CE mode signal exhibited by NBs. This confirmed the results
obtained in the preliminary evaluation, where we observed that tethering
Lps onto the surface of NBs does not compromise their imaging potential.
Additionally, it is also an indication that decorating the bubbles
with Lps could have limited the lipid shedding of the NBs, thus restricting
gas leakage and allowing retention of strong signal in the CE mode
up to the 10 min mark. Hence, liposome conjugation was observed to
be a beneficial feature for enhancing the imaging potential of NB-PTXLps,
adding to its theranostic potential.

[A] NBs and [B] NB-PTXLp.
[C] Intensity analysis of CE mode signal exhibited by NBs and NB-PTXLp.

In order to have a head-to-head comparison with
the existing commercial
US contrast agent, the echogenic response of reconstituted NBs and
SonoVue was also evaluated over a 10 min time span (Figure 7). A strong and relatively
unchanged signal was observed in B-mode and CE-mode for over the span
of 10 min for both the samples. The reconstituted NBs were found to
exhibit a stronger signal in the CE mode at all time points in comparison
to SonoVue. Even at the 10th minute time point, the reconstituted
NBs exhibited a 1.5-fold stronger signal than SonoVue which was found
to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). This
improvement in signal strength would help significantly in improving
the sensitivity of contrast imaging used for current clinical applications.
Additionally the presence of a −COOH group on the NBs could
also be explored for attachment of ligands or biologicals toward the
development of targeted NBs for varying disease pathologies. Hence,
a strong imaging potential together with the targeting capability
would be a stepping stone toward the development of promising prognostic
systems for cancer, which is currently an unmet clinical need.

Development of theranostic platforms for cancer
has always remained
a challenge owing to the range of parameters that need to be addressed
while fabricating such platforms. The two predominant challenges amongst
many are the tumor location and the tumor microenvironment. As a well-established
fact, the presence of tumors in the body can vary from the surface
location like in breast cancer to deep-seated presence like PDAC.
Additionally, because of accumulation of multiple mutations over several
generations, the dedifferentiated tumor cells are heavily dependent
on glycolysis that renders the tumor microenvironment acidic (∼pH
6.5) in most of the cancers. Hence, in terms of the imaging potential,
it is necessary for the NBs and NB-PTXLps not only to access and allow
imaging of tumors at different locations but also to retain the imaging
capability in the acidic tumor microenvironment. The pH response of
NBs and NB-PTXLps was evaluated by suspending them in phosphate-buffered
saline of pH 5.5 and 6.5. NBs and NB-PTXLps were found to exhibit
a strong and comparable echogenic response at pH 6.5 prompting towards
their ability to exhibit echogenic signals in the acidic microenvironment
of the tumors (Figure 8A). Further, they were also found to display a strong and comparable
response at pH 5.5. An acidic pH of 5.5 is generally encountered in
the endosomal compartment of the cell. Though the study is not aimed
at addressing endosome related features, however if it were to address
them for future applications, the strong echogenic response of NBs
at pH 5.5 would be an added benefit for US imaging. In addition, in-depth
response of NBs and NB-PTXLps was evaluated using a modified tissue-mimicking
phantom (Figure 9B)
with sample wells embedded at different depths (2, 4, 6, 8 cm) from
the imaging surface. Strong echogenic signals were observed for NBs
and NB-PTXLps in both B mode and CE mode at all the four depths studied
(Figure 9A), and the
variation in the signal strength over multiple depths was not statistically
significant. Hence, the study proved the potential of NBs and NB-PTXLps
to exhibit not only a strong imaging signal at multiple depths but
also their stability and imaging capability post dispersion in the
acidic tumor microenvironment.

8 cm). [C] Intensity analysis of CE mode contrast exhibited by NB
and NB-PTXLp at variable depths.

2.7 Storage Stability of NBs
To determine
the storage conditions for maximum stability, the prepared NBs were
subjected to preliminary stability testing at 4 °C and room temperature
over a span of 1 week. Stability end points were retention and compactness
of the NB middle layer and subsequent echogenic response evaluation.
Physical observations revealed that under both the conditions of storage,
the layer of NBs was found to be compact and undisturbed over the
7 day period (Figure 10A). The echogenic response evaluation revealed strong intensity in
B-mode and CE mode from day 1 to day 7 for NBs stored at both 4 °C
and room temperature. The difference between day 1 and day 7 signal
intensity was not statistically significant. For comparison with the
commercial agent SonoVue which has a stability of 6 h post reconstitution,43 we evaluated the storage stability of reconstituted
NBs at 4 °C over a 1 week span. Strong echo intensity was observed
from day 1 to day 7, with the difference not being statistically significant
(Figure 10A). This
evidently prompted to a minimum 1 week stability of reconstituted
NBs, which was significantly higher in comparison to the 6 h stability
of SonoVue post reconstitution. In addition to the storage stability,
we also determined the minimum concentration of NBs that could give
a strong echogenic response for efficient clinical imaging. The NBs
were subjected to a dilution from 5000 to 1 μg/mL followed by
echogenicity evaluation (Figure S3). Strong
echogenic signal was obtained for concentrations up to 5 μg/mL,
followed by a 4-fold reduction in signal intensity for 1 μg/mL,
indicating that an NB concentration as low as 5 μg/mL could
be used for clinical imaging.

2.8 US-Triggered
Cellular Sonoporation
In order to determine the effect of
US on cellular morphology, a
preliminary evaluation was conducted on L929 murine fibroblast cells.
An US pulse of 1 W/cm2 and 75% duty cycle was applied to
a monolayer of adhered L929 cells for 30 s. In group 1, the cells
were formaldehyde fixed immediately post pulsing whereas in group
2, a recovery time of 4 h was allowed post US pulsing and followed
by fixing the cells. Both the treatment groups were then observed
under cryo-FEG-SEM (Figure S5). A total
of 100 cells were imaged for both the groups. In group 1, 87/100 cells
exhibited membrane disruptions on the surface known as sonopores.
However, in group 2, only 4/100 cells were found to have the sonopores,
indicating transient existence of sonopores that reseal with time.
US induces cavitation of dissolved gas pockets on the surface of the
cells which causes a directional fluid displacement on the surface
of the cells referred to the microjets. As a consequence of microjetting,
a shear force is exerted on the cell surface that results in localized
disruption of the membrane leading to the formation of sonopores.
These sonopores eventually act a physical passage for broad range
of micro/macromolecules in the vicinity of the pore to gain entry
into the cellular cytosol. To evaluate the role of NBs in sonopore
formation, a similar experiment was carried out with PDAC cell line
MiaPaCa-2 (Figure 11A). In the group treated with only US (1 W/cm2, 75% duty
cycle, 30 s), 85/100 cells scanned were found to exhibit the presence
of sonopores having an average size of ∼400 nm, and the average
number of pores per cell was found to be ∼2. However, in the
NB + US group, 96/100 cells were found to show the presence of sonopores
having an average size ∼550 nm and average number of pores
per cell was ∼4 (Table 2). Hence, it was evident that treatment with NBs in the presence
of US not only increased the pore size but also increased the number
of pores per cell. This overall enhancement in the extent of sonoporation
is attributed to the US-induced cavitation of NBs, which significantly
enhances the cell membrane permeability.

2.9 US-Triggered Cellular Uptake
The
effect of NBs and US on cellular uptake of external cargo was observed
in MiaPaca-2 cell line. On a general note, US-treated groups (1 W/cm2, 75% duty cycle, 30 s) were found to have higher uptake of
free R-6G and R-6G-loaded Lps in comparison to the non-US-treated
groups. The R-6G-Lp + US and the NB-R6g-Lp + US group showed a 1.5-
and 2.5-fold higher uptake of Lps, respectively, in comparison to
the non-US-treated R-6G-Lp group (Figure 11B). Higher fluorescence signal observed
in conjugate treatment could be attributed to the close proximity
of Lps to the NBs, resulting in higher uptake upon US application.
Hence, the cumulative analysis of sonoporation and internalization
data present a concrete evidence that US enhances the cell membrane
permeability by the formation of transient sonopores on the surface
of the cell, allowing a higher uptake of extracellular cargo. However
in the presence of NBs, the permeabilization effect is further enhanced
by increasing the number and size of sonopores, a property which can
be efficiently leveraged for an efficient and tunable US-triggered
intracellular drug delivery.

2.10 In Vitro
Cellular Cytotoxicity
The
anticancer effect of PTX, PTXLp, NB-PTXLp, and NB-PTXLp + US was evaluated
on MiPaCa-2, Panc-1, MDA-MB-231, and AW-8507 cell lines. Commercial
paclitaxel containing formulations ABRAXANE and PACLITAX were used
as positive controls. An increase in cytotoxicity (in terms of lowered
IC50) was observed when the PTX was incorporated into Lps
as compared to equivalent amount of free PTX (Table S1). This highlights the beneficial role of biomimetic
nanocarriers like Lps in enhancing the therapeutic bioavailability
by enveloping the drug moieties. Further, a several fold decrease
in IC50 was observed for the NB-PTXLp + US group as compared
to all other groups in the four cell lines (Figure 12). NB-PTXLp + US was found to have almost
1000-fold higher cytotoxicity in comparison to free PTX in MiaPaca-2,
Panc-1, and MDA-MB-231 and 100-fold higher toxicity in AW-8507 cell
line. Furthermore the NB-PTXLp + US also exhibited a 10-fold and 100-fold
reduction in IC50 in comparison to PTX liposome for Miapaca
and Panc-1 cell line, respectively. Also, in all of the four cell
lines, NB-PTXLp + US exhibited several fold higher cytotoxicity in
comparison to the commercial PTX formulations ABRAXANE and PACLITAX.
The result highlights the overall improvement in the anticancer activity
upon drug incorporation into a biocompatible liposomal nanocarrier
which is further enhanced upon application of an external trigger
like US. Reduction in IC50 not only helps to lower the
overall dosage of the drug thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy
of the formulation but also reduces the systemic side effects and
improves the patient compliance. However, validation of the formulation
in preclinical models is an essential feature prior to clinical usage.

3 Conclusions
Summarizing the above work, submicron-sized (∼500 nm) nanobubble-paclitaxel
liposome complexes (NB-PTXLp) were successfully prepared for US contrast
imaging and US-triggered drug delivery in cancer cells. Binding of
Lps on the surface of NBs did not compromise the imaging potential
of the NB-PTXLp theranostic system. Moreover, the US induced cavitation
of NBs resulted in the sonoporation of cancer cells enhancing their
permeability. This facilitated enhanced cellular uptake of PTX-loaded
Lps, resulting in several fold higher anticancer efficacy of NB-PTXLps
compared to the commercial formulations ABRAXANE and PACLITAX, confirming
our hypothesis. Although promising as a theranostic platform for in
vitro evaluation, a comprehensive preclinical study needs to be undertaken
to realize the theranostic potential of NB-PTXLps for clinical applications.

for Cell Sciences, (NCCS) Pune. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM), Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline 1×, Trypsin
EDTA solution, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from HIMEDIA.
Degassed water was used in the preparation of tissue mimicking agarose
phantoms for US echogenicity studies.

4.2 Preparation
of NBs
The NBs were prepared
by thin-film hydration method described as follows: Briefly, DPPC
and stearic acid were weighed in a molar ratio of 9:1, and a thin
film was prepared in a round-bottom flask using a chloroform/methanol
solvent mixture (2:1 by volume). The thin film was hydrated with PBS
1× pH 7.4 at 180 rpm and 45 °C in a rotary evaporator for
1 h, to achieve a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Post hydration,
the suspension was purged with SF6 gas and subsequently
allowed to stand in a tube for 30 min to allow the formation of NBs.
The hydrodynamic size of the NBs was determined by dynamic light scattering
(DLS). Surface charge/zeta potential was determined using Brookhaven
ZetaPALS. Additionally, the structural features of the NBs were visualized
by electron microscopy on a JEOL field emission gun—transmission
electron microscope (Feg-TEM). For a comparative study with the commercial
microbubble formulation, SonoVue, NBs were prepared as stated above
with 1% d-mannitol as a cryoprotectant to achieve a final
lipid concentration of 5 mg/mL in accordance with manufacturer instructions
for SonoVue, followed by freezing at −196 °C in liquid
nitrogen and subsequent freeze-drying in a lyophilizer for 48 h. The
freeze-dried powder was transferred to a glass vial and sealed followed
by purging of the headspace with SF6 gas. Prior to usage,
the vial was injected with 5 mL PBS 1× pH 7.4 and shaken vigorously
for 60 s to obtain a uniform suspension of reconstituted NBs.

4.3 Preparation of Lps
The Lps were prepared
by the thin-film hydration method described as follows: Briefly, DPPC
and DOPE were weighed in a molar ratios 9:1 to form a thin film using
chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1 by volume) in a round-bottom flask.
The thin film was hydrated with PBS 1× pH 7.4 at 180 rpm and
45 °C on a rotary evaporator for 1 h. The hydrated suspension
was subjected to sonication using a probe sonicator at a frequency
of 20 KHz and 40% amplitude for 3 cycles of 2 min each at an interval
of 1 min. The sonicated suspension was centrifuged at 15 000g, 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet was reconstituted
in PBS pH 7.4 to achieve a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. Paclitaxel-loaded
Lps were prepared in a similar manner using three different lipid/drug
ratios (10:1, 15:1, and 20:1), wherein PTX was added to the phospholipids
mixture during the preparation of the thin film. The hydrodynamic
size of the Lps was determined by DLS. Surface charge/zeta potential
was determined using Brookhaven ZetaPALS. The structural features
of Lps were visualized by electron microscopy on a JEOL Feg-TEM.

4.4 Evaluation of PTX Entrapment in Lps
Reverse-phase
HPLC was used for quantification of PTX. The C18 reverse-phase
HPLC column (LiChrosphere) was used as the stationary phase. Acetonitrile/Milli-Q
(60:40 ratio) was used as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1 mL/min
and total runtime of 10 min. Standard curve of PTX was prepared in
the range 5–15 μg/mL by dissolving the drug in methanol
and preparing the further dilutions in the mobile-phase mixture. After
the preparation of PTX Lps, the pellet obtained post centrifugation
was resuspended in the PBS/methanol mixture (3:7 v/v) and subjected
to the HPLC analysis. Post HPLC analysis, the % entrapment efficiency
of PTX was determined with the following equation.  where Cp—concentration
of PTX in the pellet and C0—concentration
of PTX in the hydrated-unsonicated formulation

4.5 Preparation
of Nanobubble/Liposome Conjugates
NBs and Lps were prepared
as described in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively,
and conjugated using the EDC/NHS coupling. Briefly, NBs were treated
with 0.07% EDC and 0.04% NHS followed by addition of Lps and gentle
mixing. The NB/Lp conjugation efficiency was determined by flow cytometry
analysis. Lps were labeled with 0.1 mg/mL FITC, and NBs were labeled
with 0.1 mg/mL Nile red. Conjugates were prepared as mentioned previously
with NB/Lp ratios 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, and 1:10. Unlabeled NBs and Lps were
used as negative controls. The percentage of double fluorescence positive
population was recorded as a measure of the conjugation efficiency.

4.6 In Vitro PTX Release
In order to
study the release kinetics of PTX upon application of US trigger,
NBPTXLp’s (group 1 and 2) were added to a dialysis membrane
with a size exclusion limit of 50 kDa. A PBS/methanol (70:30 v/v)
mixture was used as a sink to solubilize the released PTX. The sample-loaded
membrane capsule was suspended in a 20 mL sink comprising of PBS/methanol
(70:30 v/v) mixture in a 50 mL falcon tube. Group 2 was treated with
an US pulse of 1 W/cm2 and 75% duty cycle for 30 s, whereas
group 1 served as the non-US-treated control. The tubes were then
incubated at 37 °C in a shaker water bath at 60 rpm. One milliliter
aliquots of the sink were withdrawn at regular time intervals up to
48 h, with simultaneous replenishment with 1 mL of fresh PBS/methanol
(70:30 v/v) mixture. The amount of PTX released within the span of
48 h was quantified using HPLC as described in Section 4.4.

4.7 In Vitro
Echogenicity Evaluation
NBs, PTXLps, and NB-PTXLp conjugates
were prepared as described Sections 4.2, 2.3, and 2.5, respectively,
with a concentration of 5 mg/mL. For echogenicity evaluation, a tissue
mimicking phantom of 1% agarose was prepared with incorporated cylindrical
wells for loading samples. After loading samples into the phantom
wells, a 12–3 MHz probe was scanned on the anterior wall of
the phantom, and the signal was observed using Philips EPIQ-7G US
assembly in B-mode and CE mode. Degassed 1× PBS and PTXLps were
used as negative controls and commercial contrast agent SonoVue was
used as the positive control. Time point echogenic stability of the
NBs, NB-PTXLp conjugates, and reconstituted NBs was evaluated by monitoring
the echogenic signal over a span of 10 min under a constant US pulse.
In order to determine the sensitivity of imaging response, NBs were
subjected to dilution to achieve a concentration range from 5000 to
1 μg/mL and subjected to echogenic evaluation. To evaluate the
echogenic response of NBs and NB-PTXLp conjugates at multiple depths,
1% agarose phantom was prepared with wells casted at multiple distances
(2, 4, 6, 8 cm) from the scanning surface. pH stability of the NBs
and NB-PTXLp conjugates was determined by suspending them in 1×
PBS pH 5.5 and 6.5 then determining the echogenic response.

4.8 Storage Stability of NBs
To determine
the storage stability at different temperatures, NBs were prepared
as mentioned earlier with a final lipid concentration of 5 mg/mL and
stored at 4 °C and room temperature, and echogenic response of
the stored NBs was recorded after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days using the agarose
phantom assembly as described in Section 4.7.

4.9 Cell Culture
L929
murine fibroblast
cell line, Human PDAC cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and Panc-1), triple negative
human breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), and Human Head and Neck
cancer cell line (AW-8507) were purchased from NCCS, Pune. The cell
lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS (20% FBS for AW-8507)
and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic solution under incubation conditions
of 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an atmosphere of 70% relative
humidity.

4.10 US Triggered Cellular
Sonoporation
MiaPaCa-2 cells were seeded at a density of
105 cells/well
on a coverslip in a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C
in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 70% relative humidity. Post incubation,
spent media was discarded and replaced with freshly prepared NBs diluted
to 10 μg/mL in DMEM. US pulse of 1 W/cm2 and 75%
duty cycle was administered to individual wells using 1 MHz probe
of Sonidel SP 100 sonoporator for 30 s. After the US treatment, spent
media was immediately discarded followed by PBS washing and fixation
in 10% formaldehyde. Post fixation, the coverslip was PBS washed and
then subject to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. After freezing,
the coverslip was observed under a scanning electron microscope (Cryo-FEG-SEM),
and the cell surface was scanned for the presence of sonopores. Cells
untreated with US were used as negative controls.

4.11 US-Triggered Cellular Uptake
MiaPaCa-2
cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells/well on a coverslip
in a 24 well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 70% relative humidity. Post incubation, spent
media was discarded and replaced with 1 mL fresh DMEM containing R-6G,
R-6G-labeled LPs, or R-6G LP-NB conjugates in different test groups.
The relative concentration of R-6G was kept constant in all groups.
All groups were evaluated with and without exposure to US. The US-treated
groups were exposed to an US pulse of 1 W/cm2 and 75% duty
cycle using 1 MHz probe of Sonidel SP 100 sonoporator for 30 s. Post
treatment, the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 70% relative humidity. After 3 h, spent media
was discarded, followed by PBS washing and fixation in 10% formaldehyde
followed by PBS washes. The coverslips were glycerol mounted on glass
slides and visualized under 63× objective in a confocal laser
scanning microscope using excitation–emission wavelengths of
524/547 nm.

4.12 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
MiaPaCa-2,
Panc-1, MDA-MB-231, and AW-8507 cells were seeded at a density of
5000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C
in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 70% relative humidity. Post incubation,
spent media was discarded and replaced with 200 μL fresh DMEM
containing ABRAXANE (group 1), PACLITAX (group 2), paclitaxel API
(group 3), PTXLps (group 4), and NB-PTXLp conjugates (group 5 and
6). A PTX concentration range of 100 pM to 10 μM was used in
all groups. Group 6 was treated with an US pulse of 1 W/cm2 and 75% duty cycle using 1 MHz probe of Sonidel SP 100 sonoporator
for 30 s. Post treatment, the plates were incubated for 48 h at 37
°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere and 70% relative humidity.
After 48 h, spent media was discarded and MTT assay was performed
to determine the cell viability. IC50 values of PTX in
group 1–6 were determined using Graph Pad Prism 5.0.

4.13 Statistical Analysis
All experimental
studies were carried out in triplicates (n = 3),
and the data obtained are represented as a combination of mean and
standard deviation (mean ± standard deviation). Statistical significance
was determined by students t-test, and one way and
two way ANOVA using Graph Pad prism 5.0. p < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant for all of the data
sets.
