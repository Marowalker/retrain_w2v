To evaluate the role of atmospheric
heterogeneous reactions on
the ice nucleation ability of airborne dust particles, we investigated
the systematic study of ice nucleation microphysics with a suite of
atmospherically relevant metals (10), halides (4), and oxyhalides
(2). Within a minute, a kaolin–iron oxide composite (KaFe)
showed efficient reactions with aqueous mercury salts. Among the different
mercury salts tested, only HgCl2 reacting with KaFe generated
HgKaFe, a highly efficient ice nucleating particle (HEIN). When added
to water, HgKaFe caused water to freeze at much warmer temperatures,
within a narrow range of −6.6 to −4.7 °C. Using
a suite of optical spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and microscopy
techniques, we performed various experiments to decipher the physical
and chemical properties of surface and bulk. KaFe was identified as
a mixture of different iron oxides, namely, goethite, hematite, magnetite,
and ε-Fe2O3, with kaolin. In HgKaFe, HgCl2 was reduced to Hg2Cl2 and iron was
predominantly in maghemite form. Reduction of Fe2+ by NaBH4, followed by aerial oxidation, helped KaFe to be an exact
precursor for the synthesis of HEIN HgKaFe. Kaolin served as a template
for synthesizing iron oxide, opposing unwanted aggregation. No other
metal or metal halide was found to have more efficient nucleating
particles than HgCl2 with KaFe composite. The chelation
of Hg(II) hindered the formation of HEIN. This study is useful for
investigating the role of morphology and how inorganic chemical reactions
on the surface of dust change morphology and thus ice nucleation activity.
The understanding of the fundamentals of what makes a particle to
be a good ice nucleating particle is valuable to further understand
and predict the amount and types of atmospheric ice nucleating particles.

1 Introduction
Iron-rich kaolin is found in many places on Earth.1 Kaolin seldom possesses aluminum oxides or hydroxides.
Weathering and degradation of feldspars and other aluminosilicates
result in the formation of kaolin, transported by the wind in the
atmosphere. This process includes the elimination of various cations
and the product with contaminants.1 Fe
is a common contaminant of kaolin and often leaches from kaolin to
precipitate as oxide or oxyhydroxide.2 The
laminated limestones of the Late Triassic Mohila Formation (Makhtesh
Ramon, Israel) are interbedded with dolomite, gypsum, and some illite,
kaolinite (mostly Fe-rich), and mixed-layer clay.3,4 Various
mining and fossil fuel power generation activities have also shown
the concurrent emission of dusts containing iron and various clay
minerals like kaolin, as well as trace metals, such as mercury.5

Nanoparticles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere
and are known to
be of the utmost importance by both health and climate organizations.
Adams et al.6 vividly explained the role
nanoparticles play in climate change. Similarly, Gwinn and Vallyathan
demonstrated the pros and cons of nanoparticles on health.7 As a matter of fact, nanoparticle-induced ice
nucleation is an important field of study, in relation to climate
and health.8

The ice nucleation phenomenon
is something that we experience almost
regularly in a variety of scenarios, including climate change and
intracellular freezing.9−12 Pure supercooled water can be cooled to ca. −40 °C without
freezing.9 However, the ice nucleation
phenomena in nature occurs very often due to the nucleating substances,
ranging from nanoparticles and biological compounds to crystalline
surfaces. The remarkable diversity in nucleating compounds makes the
mechanism of ice nucleation by efficient ice nucleating particles
very complicated.13 Since the last few
decades, a great deal of experimental and theoretical research has
been undertaken to reveal the unequivocal driving force for efficient
ice nucleation. However, the understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation
is quite complex, and its physicochemical intricacy has yet to be
deciphered.

During the last five decades, several organic and
inorganic materials
have been suggested to contribute to ice nucleation.14−18 To date, the best ice nucleating particles have been selected bacteria,
including Gram-negative Pseudomonas syringae, which freeze at about −2 °C.14 Yet, due to the propensity of dust particles globally, the overall
impact of dust particles on ice nucleation has been considered to
be very important.

Mineral dusts are ubiquitous in the atmosphere
and contain various
metals and minerals, including a suite of metals, metal oxides, and
clay minerals, such as kaolin. Many studies related to the efficiency
of mineral dust and acid-coated mineral dust have been conducted for
heterogeneous ice nucleation at cirrus temperatures. Because of the
abundance in observed aerosols around the world, various types of
iron oxides have been employed as a surrogate for environmental mineral
dust particles.15 Furthermore, some studies
have provided identification of efficiency of ice nucleation by generating
active sites of clay particles, like feldspar, kaolin, and montmorillonite,
with or without metal particles.16−18

It has been increasingly
clear that atmospheric aerosols are mostly
not homogenous in composition or phase. Many studies indicate that
several ice nucleating particles in the atmosphere and at atmospheric
interfaces (air/snow/ice/water/soil) can be heterogeneous in composition
with multiphase configurations.19 Yet,
the impact of co-pollutants and the physical and chemical processes
leading to the change of nucleation processes are still unknown.

Along with the possible uptake of aerosols, mercury species may
partake in nucleation, leading to a phase alteration, from a less
condensed to a more condensed phase.20 Iron
particles in the nanoregime have been proven to be excellent platforms
to uptake many kinds of metal ions.21,22 Liu et al.23 demonstrated density functional theory (DFT)
as well as conducted experimental studies on the mechanism of elemental
mercury capture, in the presence of HCl on α-Fe2O3(001). Further experimental and theoretical works are yet
to be done to understand the effect of a toxic metal, like mercury,
on clay particles containing other metals.

In this study, we
investigated the ice nucleation ability of the
combination of a suite of metal and metal oxides as well as inorganic
halogenated compounds of relevance to the atmosphere and to atmospheric
surfaces. Among several freezing modes, we followed immersion freezing
mode using drop-freezing experiments to understand the ice nucleation
efficiency.24,25 We provide the evidence for a
kaolin–iron oxide composite (KaFe) that absorbs HgCl2 in water. Through a complementary suite of spectroscopic and microscopic
techniques, we provide physical and chemical insights of our observations
and a potential reaction mechanism.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of KaFe
and HgKaFe
We performed complementary synthesis, characterization,
and microphysics
studies. The following section explores all systematic steps that
led to the identification of effective ice nucleating particles. This
can expand the range of known ice nucleating materials, particularly
with more diverse emissions of emerging nanoparticle contaminants
in the atmosphere coming to light. The mean freezing temperature (MFT)
is a measure of the ice nucleation ability of nucleating particles.
Brooks et al. compared ice nucleation activity of soot and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons using the mean freezing temperature (MFT).26 For the purpose of clarity in describing the
relative ice nucleation temperature patterns of various ice nucleating
particles studied in this work, particles with a mean freezing temperature
<7 °C were classified as highly efficient ice nucleating particles
(HEINs), those with a mean freezing temperature in between −14
and −7 °C were termed as average ice nucleating particles,
and the particles with a mean freezing temperature in between −21
and −14 °C were termed as poor ice nucleating particles.

KaFe was a gray solid, synthesized from off-white kaolin and greenish
yellow FeCl2·4H2O, after treatment with
sodium borohydride. Our experiment showed that the freezing range
of KaFe was −20.2 to −8.8 °C (poor ice nucleating
particles with MFT of −16.7 °C) when HgKaFe (KaFe@HgCl2) was a HEIN. No other metal chloride, except HgCl2, demonstrated high ice nucleation ability with KaFe, as illustrated
in Figure 1. To comprehend
its ice nucleation efficiency, knowledge on its physicochemical state
is pivotal. Therefore, we characterized KaFe and HgKaFe via microscopic
and spectroscopic techniques to understand the drastic differences
of ice nucleation properties.

the mean freezing temperature of 3.69 × 10–3 M HgCl2 with different amounts of BHFe and KaFe in 10

To understand the surface morphology, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis was performed. Pure kaolin was found to be as a stacked
nanodish under a scanning electron microscope, whereas in KaFe, particles
were attached to the dish as spheres and long wires (made of a small
unit sphere of ca. 60–80 nm). However, in BHFe (HEIN), obtained
by NaBH4 treatment with FeCl2·4H2O, particles were arranged mostly as aggregated nanowire. Nanospheres
and nanowires in KaFe were converted to nanodots on the surface of
kaolin in HgKaFe. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis indicated
that HgKaFe had more oxygen than KaFe (Figures 2 and S1, Supporting
Information). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, discussed below, indicated
that KaFe possesses iron oxide. Thereby, iron was further oxidized
in HgKaFe. Also, HgCl2 was reduced to Hg2Cl2 in the presence of KaFe. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analysis supported BHFe to be more aggregated in comparison
to KaFe. From high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
analysis, it became evident that KaFe contained magnetite (Fe3O4) as well as goethite (FeOOH). A lattice fringe
of 0.29 nm corresponds to the (220) lattice plane of Fe3O4, whereas a lattice fringe of 0.47 nm corresponds to
FeOOH.27−29 Furthermore, a lattice fringe of 0.47 nm may likely
be due to the (002) plane of ε-Fe2O3 (reported
lattice fringe of 0.48 nm).30 On the other
hand, a lattice fringe of 0.47 nm was found at different regions of
HgKaFe for the (111) plane of maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), as depicted in Figure 3.27

XRD analysis indicated that KaFe contained ε-Fe2O3 (20.3%), hematite (16.1%), goethite (10.2%),
and magnetite
(4.6%). However, HgKaFe contained maghemite-C, syn (11.9%). Therefore,
HgKaFe predominantly possessed one type of iron oxide, i.e., maghemite. Figures 4 and S2–S4, in the Supporting Information,
represent the XRD spectra and structural fitting pattern details of
KaFe and HgKaFe. In HgKaFe, HgCl2 was reduced to Hg2Cl2. As such, during the in situ process, a maghemite–Hg2Cl2 composite was produced with HEIN characteristics.

obtained from XRD analysis.

From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we
found
that both KaFe (711.48 eV) and HgKaFe (711.38 eV) had similar oxidation
states to Fe(III) 2p3/2 oxide. Satellite peaks found in
both KaFe and HgKaFe indicated that neither compound contained only
magnetite.31 The HgKaFe peak for the binding
energy of Hg was 101.08–101.48 eV. This peak might be due to
the presence of some unreacted HgCl2, along with Hg2Cl2 (calomel).32 A shift
in binding energy of Hg(I) 4f7/2 toward a higher-energy
region was the result of the anchoring of Hg2Cl2 to electron-deficient iron oxide maghemite. The main components
of kaolin are Al and Si. A decrease in the binding energies of Al
2p and Si 2p in HgKaFe (75.20 eV for Al and 103.06 eV for Si) in comparison
to KaFe (75.37 eV for Al and 103.93 eV for Si) indicated that Al and
Si were electron-rich by further oxidizing magnetite (Fe3O4) to maghemite in HgKaFe. More metal–oxide interactions
(∼530.3 eV) in HgKaFe than in KaFe implied that a higher concentration
of iron(III) oxide was formed mainly in HgKaFe compared to KaFe.33 It is to be mentioned that Cl– 2p in HgCl2 did not alter its electronic state in HgKaFe
(binding energy, 199.53 eV)34 (Figures 5 and S5, Supporting Information).

The symbol ★ in A1 and B1 represents a satellite peak.

It is important to note that no
detectable Hg(0) was emitted from
HgKaFe, as determined by mass spectral analysis (shown in Figure 6) under our experimental
conditions. Instead of using NaBH4, the use of NH4OH during the preparation of KaFe resulted in HgKaFe, which is a
poor ice nucleating particle (MFT, −16.3 °C). As such,
the reduction of iron chloride with NaBH4, followed by
aerial oxidation of KaFe, produces HgKaFe (HEIN) with aqueous HgCl2, as illustrated in Figure S6 in
the Supporting Information.

from HgKaFe
and digital images of 10 μL water droplet on thin films (of
kaolin, KaFe, and HgKaFe).

Thin films of kaolin, KaFe, and HgKaFe were made from their
aqueous
suspensions via spin coating. Then, 10 μL of Milli-Q water was
dropped onto each of the films. Subsequently, using a goniometer,
we measured the contact angles of the drops. Kaolin and HgKaFe were
hydrophilic compounds with measured contact angles of 33 and 32°,
respectively. On the contrary, KaFe was very much hydrophilic and
its contact angle was 12°, as shown in Figure 6. However, HgKaFe was shown to be the HEIN.
A low contact angle generally refers to a higher affinity toward water.
Lupi and Molinero35 discovered that the
increment of hydrophilicity can exhibit adverse effects, due to the
incorporation of OH groups, reducing water–surface interaction
strength. The experiment performed by Whale et al.36 also supports the aforementioned proposition. Notwithstanding these data, contact angle measurement using thin
films should not be the sole conclusive measure to evaluate ice nucleating
potentials of particles.

2.2 HEIN HgKaFe
KaFe
in water was classified
as a poor ice nucleating material, as mentioned above. Similarly,
kaolin showed ice nucleation ability within the range of −20
to −12 °C (MFT, −16.2 °C). We subsequently
sonicated 0.0025 g of KaFe inside an aqueous solution of 10 mL of
3.69 × 10–3 M HgCl2 for 10 min.
Further ice nucleation experiments were carried out, and it was discovered
that water froze at much warmer temperatures (−6.6 to −4.7
°C; MFT, −5.6 °C). We note that pure HgCl2 (3.69 × 10–3 M) was also found to be a poor
ice nucleating material. An aqueous solution of 3.69 × 10–3 M HgCl2 froze within a range of −17
to −6 °C (MFT, −15.3 °C). HgKaFe, as HEIN,
was obtained when 0.0025 g of KaFe was sonicated with 10 mL of a 3.69
× 10–3 M aqueous HgCl2 solution
for 10 min. At this point, water froze very quickly within a narrow
temperature range of −6.6 to −4.7 °C. NaBH4-treated kaolin (BHKa) was a poor ice nucleating material
in water (−21 to −11 °C; MFT, −18.7 °C)
or an average ice nucleating material with aqueous HgCl2 (−20 to −8 °C; MFT, −13.5 °C). Interestingly,
it was discovered that NaBH4-treated FeCl2·4H2O (BHFe), without kaolin, was a poor ice nucleating material
(−22 to −12 °C; MFT, −17.4 °C). On
the contrary, BHFe was a HEIN in aqueous HgCl2 solution
(−7.5 to −4.8 °C; MFT, −5.8 °C). Thus,
the Fe–Hg composite was indeed a HEIN, whether kaolin was present
in the system or not, as depicted in Figure 7A.

× 10–3 M, i.e., 0.01 g) with 0.0025 g of KaFe;

g of KaFe; (E) 3.69 × 10–3 M Hg(NO3)2 with 0.0025 g of KaFe in the presence of different

and different iron oxide (0.0025 g) with HgCl2 (3.69 ×
10–3 M); and (I) HgKaFe (KaFe prepared from different
iron precursors).

Kaolin in KaFe was used
as a scaffold for the synthesis of Fe(0)
particles, formed initially after the addition of NaBH4. Then, rapid aerial oxidation took place, forming kaolin-passivated
iron oxide. It was previously reported that modified zero-valent iron
nanoparticles enhance the rapidity and efficacy of remediation.37,38 During the reduction of an aqueous iron salt, support materials
were introduced to prevent the usual aggregation of iron nanoparticles,
as have been previously reported by Ponder et al.21 and Zhang et al.37 Therefore,
the dispersion of kaolin-embedded iron oxide nanoparticles (KaFe)
exhibited a higher specific surface area. Consequently, a higher reactivity
of iron toward the aqueous HgCl2 was observed, and 0.0025
g of solid KaFe (containing less iron than 0.0025 g of solid BHFe)
showed improved ice nucleation ability with aqueous HgCl2, compared to 0.0025 g of BHFe with aqueous HgCl2 of a
similar concentration.

2.3 Impact of the Change of
Concentration and
Mixing Ratios of Composites on Ice Nucleation
In this study,
both KaFe and BHFe were HEIN, with HgCl2. Ice nucleation
efficiency was investigated at a wide range of concentrations of KaFe
and BHFe with HgCl2. It was discovered that the efficiency
of BHFe with HgCl2 as an ice nucleating particle decreased
rapidly with decreasing concentration, unlike KaFe. KaFe was a much
more efficient nucleating particle (−6.4 to −4.2 °C;
MFT, −5.4 °C when 0.0012 g of KaFe was employed) with
HgCl2 than BHFe (−11.9 to −7.4 °C; MFT,
−10.5 °C when 0.0012 g of BHFe was employed), when the
amount was <0.0025 g. This experiment provided evidence for the
importance of kaolin as a template and the importance of making KaFe
more efficient by protecting the rapid aggregation of iron particles.39,40 Thereby, under our experimental conditions, kaolin enhanced the
surface-to-volume ratio (and active sites at the surface) of iron
particles (Figures 1B and S7, Supporting Information).

During the synthesis of KaFe, we varied the concentration ratio of
kaolin to FeCl2·4H2O, keeping the amount
of kaolin and NaBH4 unchanged. KaFe, prepared from higher
[FeCl2·4H2O], was found to be a more efficient
ice nucleating particle with HgCl2 [KaFe from FeCl2·4H2O/kaolin = 0.125 with a freezing range
of −19.7 to −8.1 °C (MFT, −15.3 °C)
with HgCl2, whereas KaFe from FeCl2·4H2O/kaolin = 4.000 with a freezing range of −6.5 to −4.9
°C (MFT, −4.4 °C) with HgCl2]. This indicated
that the iron particle was the key player for ice nucleation and kaolin
was its template, as depicted in Figure 7B. Besides, change of surface area, morphology,
or size of the particles might be altered in KaFe (of altered iron-to-kaolin
ratio), resulting in altered ice nucleation ability.

2.4 Importance of HgCl2
Under
our experimental conditions, no other studied metal chloride except
mercury(II) chloride, namely, copper(II) chloride, sodium(I) chloride,
aluminum(III) chloride, nickel(II) chloride, cobalt(II) chloride,
chromium(II) chloride, potassium(I) chloride, calcium(II) chloride,
magnesium(II) chloride, or tin(II) chloride, could produce HEIN with
KaFe. In other words, the Fe–Hg composite was very selective
to produce efficient ice nucleating particles, as shown in Figures 1 and S8, in the Supporting Information.

When
we increased [HgCl2] gradually with a fixed amount of KaFe
(0.0025 g), it was observed that KaFe increased its efficiency as
an ice nucleating particle. When 0.0025 g of HgCl2 is used
in 10 mL of an aqueous KaFe suspension, the freezing range is −14.9
to −8 °C (MFT, −14 °C). On the other hand,
when 0.05 g of HgCl2 was employed in 10 mL of an aqueous
KaFe suspension, the freezing range was −5 to −3.5 °C
(MFT, −4.2 °C). This indicated that Fe–HgCl2 composites were responsible for HEIN. In other words, iron
oxide and HgCl2 were both pivotal to produce HEIN (Figure 7C).

The importance
of the chloride ion to form HEIN with KaFe was also
evaluated. The experiments above were repeated with other Hg salts,
like Hg(NO3)2, HgBr2, HgI2, Hg2(NO3)2, and HgBr. However,
they exhibited relatively poor ice nucleation ability with KaFe, as
shown in Figure 7D.
It is to be noted that insoluble HgI2 itself was an average
ice nucleating particle (−13.5 to −5.1 °C; MFT,
−10.6 °C), due to the remarkable size difference between
Hg2+ and I–, as shown in Figure S9 in the Supporting Information. HgI2 with KaFe was also found to be significantly efficient, but
not more efficient than HgCl2. The freezing range of KaFe–HgI2 (−9.3 to −4.7 °C; MFT, −7.4 °C)
was much wider than that of KaFe–HgCl2. However,
the improvement of the ice nucleation ability of HgI2,
after the association with KaFe, was not as impressive as with HgCl2. The small improvement in ice nucleation ability of HgI2 is attributed to the size difference between the cation and
anion in the compound, which is related to the ease of ionization.
Thus, both Hg and Cl were needed to generate HEIN with KaFe.

After the addition of Hg(NO3)2 to the aqueous
suspension of KaFe, the mixture was sonicated. Subsequently, different
sodium salts (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI, NaClO3, and NaIO3) were added individually and sonicated further for 10 min.
We found that only NaCl created HEIN, supporting the idea of the pivotal
role that Cl– has in the formation of HEIN. Interestingly,
NaClO3 did not produce a HEIN, indicating that the electronic
environment of Cl– was crucial, as shown in Figure 7E. Therefore, free
Cl– might also be a key player, along with Fe and
Hg, in the formation of HEIN.

We note that under our experimental
conditions, [Hg(NO3)2 + NaI] with KaFe was found
to be an average ice nucleating
material (−10.7 to −6.1 °C; MFT, −8.3 °C).
After further experiments, we observed that [Hg(NO3)2 + NaI] without KaFe produced a similar nucleation range of
−12.5 to −5.5 °C (MFT, −8.9 °C) (Figure S10, Supporting Information). However,
pure HgI2, due to its hydrophobicity, showed freezing points
from −13.5 to −5.1 °C (MFT, −10.5 °C).
The size discrepancy between Na+ and I– is much higher than that between Hg2+ and I–, facilitating ease of ionization and surface buckling for NaI.

2.5 Effect of Washing of the Precipitate of HgKaFe
HgKaFe (HEIN) was formed when 0.01 g of HgCl2 was added
to 10 mL of Milli-Q water, which contained 0.0025 g of KaFe. The precipitate
was then centrifuged and later washed several times with Milli-Q water.
Ice nucleation experiments were then performed in the presence of
10 mL of Milli-Q water, containing 0.01 g of HgCl2. The
efficiency of HgKaFe as an ice nucleating particle was reduced remarkably
after the first cycle. We observed freezing points within the range
of −6.6 to −4.7 °C (MFT, −5.7 °C) for
the first cycle, −14.6 to −8.7 °C (MFT, −12.4
°C) for the second cycle, −16.9 to −7.7 °C
(MFT, −12.5 °C) for the third cycle, and −20.5
to −13.3 °C (MFT, −13.8 °C) for the fourth
cycle. As such, we could confirm that there was a permanent change
in KaFe, after the treatment of HgCl2. Our results indicated
that there was an inactivation of the active sites of KaFe. Even after
several washes, the original KaFe, which produced HEIN with HgCl2, could not be obtained, as illustrated in Figure 7F.

We examined the ice
nucleation efficiency of the precipitate obtained in the HgKaFe solution.
The precipitate was washed several times with Milli-Q water and ice
nucleation experiments were performed in Milli-Q water. We found that
the precipitate (WHgKaFe) was frozen within the range of −23.5
to −13.3 °C (MFT, −19.5 °C). This indicated
that Hg was not strongly adsorbed in the precipitate, as illustrated
in Figure 7G. From
infrared spectra, we confirmed the existence of KaFe and WHgKaFe using
their fingerprinting spectral signatures, as depicted in Figure S11 in the Supporting Information. There
was no evidence for the presence of HgCl2 in WHgKaFe.41

2.6 Effect of Different Iron
Compounds with HgCl2 on Ice Nucleation
To examine
potential atmospheric
reactions of dust and mercury chlorides, commercially available iron
dust particles were used, as well as magnetite (Fe3O4), maghemite (γ-Fe2O3), and hematite
(α-Fe2O3), to evaluate their ice nucleation
efficiency in the presence of HgCl2. We observed the freezing
ranges of −12.9 to −6.1 °C (MFT, −11 °C),
−14.9 to −3.9 °C (MFT, −10.3 °C), −16
to −5.2 °C (MFT, −12.2 °C), and −15.2
to −5.1 °C (MFT, −10.5 °C) for iron dust particles,
magnetite, maghemite, and hematite, respectively. However, the reduction
of FeCl2·4H2O with NaBH4 (in
KaFe), followed by aerial oxidation, generated active sites for HgCl2 to sit on, producing HEIN, as illustrated in Figure 7H. From the XRD spectra, it
was evident that in KaFe, Fe is in both +2 and +3 oxidation states.
However, in HgKaFe, Fe was always observed to be at the +3 oxidation
state. Fe in KaFe was further oxidized (OKaFe) and thus completely
oxidized to its +3 oxidation state. When using a strong oxidizing
agent, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), OKaFe showed
a decrease in its ice nucleation ability (−20.1 to −9.2
°C; MFT, −16.5 °C), in the presence of HgCl2 (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

During the synthesis of KaFe, we altered the iron precursors, to
explore their impacts on ice nucleation processes. Instead of FeCl2·4H2O, we employed FeCl3·6H2O, ferrous ammonium sulfate, and ferric ammonium sulfate.
Our nucleation experiments indicated that FeCl3.6H2O also produced KaFe, which was capable of originating HEIN
with HgCl2 (−6 to −4 °C; MFT, −4.8
°C). Ferrous ammonium sulfate and ferric ammonium sulfate also
produced KaFe, KaFe from ferrous ammonium sulfate with HgCl2, and KaFe from ferric ammonium sulfate with HgCl2, nucleated
within the ranges of −12.4 to −4.3 °C (MFT, −9.7
°C) and −11.7 to −5.5 °C (MFT, −9.2
°C), respectively, as shown in Figure 7I. The decreased nucleation efficiency of
KaFe from ferric/ferrous ammonium sulfate with HgCl2 is
attributed to ammonium sulfate-induced aggregation of iron (rendering
lower surface area).

2.7 Absorption of HgCl2 in KaFe
To further provide physical insights into
the absorption of HgCl2 in KaFe, several UV–vis
spectroscopic experiments
were performed. First, we added different amounts of KaFe (0.0025–0.25
g) into 10 mL of 3.69 × 10–3 M HgCl2 and sonicated the solutions for 10 min. These solutions were then
centrifuged and diluted 13 times with Milli-Q water to record UV–vis
spectra. With increasing KaFe, the absorption of [HgCl2] was increased and an increasing amount of Hg(II) was removed from
the solution, as seen in Figure 8A. Again, for a fixed amount of KaFe (0.01 g), we repeated
a few experiments with varying concentrations of HgCl2,
as illustrated in Figure 8B. We discovered that the extent of absorption remains almost
unchanged with the variation of [HgCl2]. Figure 8C shows almost parallel lines
of absorbance for only HgCl2 and HgCl2+KaFe,
at different concentrations of HgCl2. Hg(NO3)2 and HgBr2 were also tested in the context
of absorption with KaFe. It was discovered that all Hg(II) salts were
absorbed significantly in KaFe, as illustrated in Figure S13. However, these Hg(II) salts, except for HgCl2, could not form HEIN.

different amounts of KaFe (spectra have been recorded after 13 times
dilution), [HgCl2] = 2.84 × 10–4 M. (B) UV–vis spectra of different amounts of HgCl2 in the presence and absence of fixed amount of KaFe (spectra have
been recorded after 13 times dilution). (C) Comparative study of absorbance
variation with different amounts of HgCl2 (with and without
KaFe) as mentioned in (B).

2.8 Impact of Other Metal Halides on the Absorption
in KaFe
We attempted to evaluate the impacts of different
metal chlorides [copper(II) chloride, sodium(I) chloride, aluminum(III)
chloride, nickel(II) chloride, cobalt(II) chloride, chromium(II) chloride,
potassium(I) chloride, calcium(II) chloride, magnesium(II) chloride,
tin(II) chloride] in the context of absorption in KaFe. We observed
from UV–vis spectral analysis that SnCl2, CuCl2, CrCl3, and AlCl3 were also absorbed
significantly in KaFe, like HgCl2. However, no metal chloride
(except HgCl2) could produce HEIN, as shown in Figure S14.

2.9 Effect
of Chelation
Hg(II) forms
a strong chelate with disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid
(Na2-EDTA).42,43 Having this idea in mind, we
prepared a Hg(II)–EDTA complex by mixing Na2–EDTA
and HgCl2 in a 1:1 molar ratio in Milli-Q water. Therefore,
the water solution containing [Hg(II)-EDTA]Cl2 and KaFe
resulted in an average ice nucleating material (−14.9 to −8.7
°C; MFT, −12.3 °C) compared to HgKaFe. Experimental
results indicated the necessity of having free Hg(II) in a solution
to produce HEIN. From the UV–vis spectroscopic data, it was
found that the absorption spectrum of [Hg(II)–EDTA]Cl2 was almost unaltered after sonication with KaFe, implying that [Hg(II)–EDTA]Cl2 would likely not be absorbed by KaFe (Figure 9).

KaFe = 0.01 g. The inset shows the comparison of the active-site density
per gram and temperature to show the effect of Na2–EDTA;
[Hg(II)] = 3.69 × 10–3 M, KaFe = 0.0025 g,
Milli-Q water = 10 mL.

2.10 Potential Reaction Mechanism
HgKaFe
is a HEIN and is more efficient than any mineral dust or metal particle,
which has been previously studied. The efficiency of HgKaFe, as an
ice nucleating particle, is very close to the most efficient, but
most rare ice nucleating particles in nature, biological particles.
It was found that maghemite and Hg2Cl2 were
the main constituents of HgKaFe, as mentioned below. However, it is
still being explored if the mixture of the final products together
or alone (in the presence of the other constituents, i.e., synergism)
or any secondary product is the potential ice nucleating particle.

The two highly conversed “criteria” for efficient
ice nucleating particles are the crystallographic match with respect
to bulk ice and the strength of the water–surface interactions.
As water–surface interaction is poorer for HgKaFe than for
KaFe (the contact angle is less for KaFe), the first criterion, in
this case, may be the dominant criterion. The arrangement of different
heights of atoms in the contact layer is called buckling, which is
a significant factor for efficient nucleation. It has been observed
that if the first water overlayer is not icelike, then efficient ice
nucleation is possible for pronounced buckling of the contact layer.
When the atomic arrangement in the contact region is similar, small
lattice mismatch (δ) is the pivotal factor for being an efficient
nucleating particle. Despite serious challenges from recent experiments
and simulations for validation and the generalization of the concept,
small lattice mismatch is still a primary cause of efficient ice nucleation.44−50 When the arrangements of atoms in the contact area are alike, δ
between the corresponding surface unit cells can be explained in a
more rationalized manner as 1  where ai and as represent the lattice parameters of a certain
face of ice and the surface unit cells of the substrate, respectively.

All of these factors individually or together generate HgKaFe to
be HEIN. The extraordinarily narrow freezing range of −6.6
to −4.7 °C is an indication of one kind of dominant ice
nucleating particle in HgKaFe. Further experiments and theoretical
studies are to be conducted, to design an unequivocal mechanism behind
the formation of the HEIN.

From the ice nucleation data, it
is evident that HgKaFe is an efficient
ice nucleating agent. The goal of the paper is to understand the physicochemical
properties of HgKaFe in the context of ice nucleation. We know that
iron/iron oxides in different forms (namely, magnetite,51,52 maghemite,52 hematite,52,53 Fe dust,52 etc.) are commonly available
in the atmosphere. Silver iodide (AgI) is a well-known cloud seeding
material.54 We measured ice nucleation
efficiency of iron oxides (Table 1, Figure S15, Supporting
Information) and AgI (Table 1, Figure S15, Supporting Information)
in comparison to HgKaFe. The efficiency of the HgKaFe nucleation rate,
with the same size and mass of droplet, is much better (>7 °C
warmer) than iron oxides and closer to AgI.

In this paper, we are unveiling
the formation of highly efficient
ice nucleating particles, where environmentally abundant iron oxide
has a key role in the presence of toxic mercury chloride. Moreover,
kaolin and iron oxide are very common ingredients in dust particles.
Mercury in different forms is being emitted every day, creating a
great threat to the environment.55 The
importance of the contact angle, surface sites, composition, and morphology
on ice nucleation efficiency and untangling these effects from each
other were the main theme of the work. These insights can be applied
to atmospheric particles.

3 Conclusions
and Future Directions
Maghemite and Hg2Cl2 were key players in
the preparation of highly efficient, completely inorganic ice nucleating
particles. This new heterogeneous highly efficient ice nucleus was
not associated with any biomolecule, which has been previously shown
to be an efficient ice nucleating particle. No other studied metal
ion was found to be able to make such an efficient ice nucleating
particle, except mercury. Chloride also showed to play a pivotal role
in ice nucleation. Kaolin–iron oxide composites absorbed HgCl2 in an aqueous medium, and as a corollary, highly efficient
ice nucleating particles were generated. Interactions of mineral dust
particles (containing mostly iron oxide) with water vapor may alter
heterogeneous reactivity toward toxic metals. Immersion freezing (ice
nucleation by particles immersed in supercooled water) is a crucial
route for creating ice in mixed-phase clouds. Immersion freezing experiments
with particles in microliter-sized water droplets are often used for
identifying very small numbers of nucleating particles. Additionally,
atmospheric heterogeneous and multiphase reactions may influence the
chemical compositions when mineral dust particles reach the troposphere.
Therefore, interactions of mineral dust particles with water vapor
are changed.

A complete and in-depth knowledge of the interactions
between dust
and dust containing toxic metals with water vapor will help us to
understand the role mineral dust aerosols have in many facets of atmospheric
chemistry. These important facets include the increasing threat of
climate change and airborne nanoparticles near emission sources, including
urban areas. These areas are major sites of important pollutants in
climate change and environmental health. To conclude, a better understanding
of nanoparticles in the atmosphere and ice nucleation may lead to
an improvement in climate change and public health knowledge.

4 Experimental Section
In this section, we describe the
synthesis methods, as well as
various analytical techniques for chemical and physical analyses.
Also, the materials and supplies required are discussed.

4.1 Synthesis
4.1.1 Synthesis of KaFe
FeCl2·4H2O (2.67 g) was fully dissolved
in a 4:1 ethanol/water
mixture (24 mL of ethanol and 6 mL of water). Consequently, 1.5 g
of kaolin was added to the solution, creating a muddy beige mixture.
This suspension was then placed in an ultrasonic shaker for 2 h to
disperse the kaolin particles. In the meantime, a 1 M NaBH4 solution was prepared by dissolving 3.05 g of the powder in 100
mL of ice-cold Milli-Q water. When the ultrasonic shaking was completed,
the freshly prepared sodium borohydride solution was added dropwise
into the suspension with vigorous shaking, showing an instant color
change from beige to black. When the entire NaBH4 solution
was transferred, the reaction mixture was shaken for 10 min and left
to settle for 1 day. After 24 h, the supernate was decanted, while
keeping the solid inside the container with a strong magnet, then
the solid was washed eight times with 200 mL of Milli-Q water and
twice with 200 mL of ethanol. The synthesized iron–kaolin composite
was then placed in a vacuum oven at 50 °C to dry completely.
Finally, when the drying process was complete, the solid was crushed
and mixed thoroughly using a mortar and pestle to obtain KaFe.

4.1.2 Synthesis of BHFe
BHFe was synthesized
using the same procedure as the KaFe synthesis; however, kaolin was
not used.

4.1.3 Synthesis of HgKaFe
KaFe (0.0025
g) was sonicated with 10 mL of a 3.69 × 10–3 M aqueous HgCl2 solution for 10 min to form HgKaFe.

4.2 Analytical Techniques for Physical and Chemical
Characterization
4.2.1 Drop-Freezing Assays
Drop-freezing
experiments are among the most common techniques to judge the ice
nucleation efficiency of a heterogeneous ice nucleating particle in
immersion mode.19,24 A better method for gauging immersion
freezing in large droplets over a wide temperature range has been
shown by Tobo.25 For each sample, droplets
were placed on a cooling plate (in-house-made copper plate) and the
plate (starting at ∼0 °C) was cooled at a rate of 1 °C/min.
The temperature at which each droplet froze was recorded. The samples
were loaded onto the plate as 10 μL droplets. Before adding
the droplets, a thin layer of petroleum jelly was spread on the copper
plate to minimize the reactions between the copper plate and the drops
and to maintain hydrophobicity.

We followed the Tobo protocol25 to plot ice nucleation data. It was assumed
that the ice nucleation process by immersed particles in a supercooled
drop was both a temperature-dependent and time-independent process.
So, the cumulative number of ice nucleation active sites per unit
volume of water (K) at a certain temperature (T) can be presented by the following equation (eq 2) 2  When the mass
of particles per unit volume
of water is known, the ice nucleation active-site density per unit
mass (nm) can also be expressed by eq 3 3  where Cm represents
the mass concentration of the particles in the initial suspension
and d represents the dilution ratio of the suspension
relative to Cm. We have performed background
corrections by subtracting the ice nucleation data of pure Milli-Q
water.

4.2.2 UV–Vis Spectroscopy
All
UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50
Bio UV spectrophotometer. The solutions were put into a 1 cm, well-stoppered
quartz cuvette. The spectra were recorded against a reference solvent.

4.2.3 Contact Angle
Thin films of kaolin,
KaFe, and HgKaFe were prepared on a glass slide using a spin coater.
The contact angle was measured by placing 10 μL of Milli-Q water
on the thin films using a Rame-Hart goniometer (model number 100-00115).

4.2.4 Scanning Electron Microscopy
Particle
morphology was examined using an FEI Helios NanoLab 660 DualBeam (focused
ion beam) extreme high-resolution scanning electron microscope. The
microscope contains Leica Microsystems EM VCT100 Cryo Transfer System,
MultiChem Gas Injection System, and EDAX Octane Ultra 100 mm2 SDD and TEAM 3D EDS Analysis System. Samples of kaolin, KaFe, BHFe,
and HgKaFe were vacuum-dried for 24 h before measurements were taken.
The compounds were then coated with Pt and put on carbon tape before
SEM studies were conducted.

4.2.5 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Samples of kaolin (0.0025 g in 10 mL
of Milli-Q water), KaFe (0.0025
g in 10 mL of Milli-Q water), BHFe (0.0025 g in 10 mL of Milli-Q water),
and HgKaFe (5 μL) were deposited on glow-discharged carbon film-coated
copper electron microscopy grids. The droplets were kept on the grids
for 1 min, followed by blotting off the excess liquid with the edge
of a piece of filter paper. The samples were imaged using an FEI Tecnai
12 Biotwin TEM microscope (FEI Electron Optics) equipped with a tungsten
filament at 120 kV, containing an AMT XR80C CCD Camera System.

4.2.6 X-ray Diffraction
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was performed with a Bruker D8 Discovery X-ray diffractometer
(VANTEC Detector Cu-Source λ = 1.5418 Å). XRD patterns
were recorded for 3° ≤ 2θ ≤ 80° with
increments of 0.005°. Samples of kaolin, KaFe, BHFe, and HgKaFe
were vacuum-dried at room temperature before measurements were taken.

4.2.7 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out
with a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron spectrometer.
The samples were loaded onto carbon tape to be placed on a grid for
the analysis. Samples of KaFe and HgKaFe were vacuum-dried at room
temperature before measurement.

4.3 Materials
and Supplies
All of the
reagents were of analytical reagent grade, and Milli-Q water was used
throughout the experiment. Kaolin, all metal salts, iron dust, all
iron oxides, disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (Na2-EDTA), and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Sodium borohydride was obtained from Alfa Aesar. All glassware was
cleaned with freshly prepared aqua regia, subsequently rinsed with
copious amounts of distilled water, and dried well before use. All
of the reagents were used without further purification.
