A new method has
been developed for the high-value utilization
of larch bark, which is regarded as a low-value byproduct of the logging
industry. Polymeric proanthocyanidins (PPCs) were extracted from the Larix gmelinii bark and depolymerized by catalytic
hydrogenolysis, using ruthenium/carbon (Ru/C) as the catalyst. The
method has been found that although the molecular weight of the depolymerized
product was significantly lower, the basic structural units were not
destroyed, and the product retained a condensed flavanol polyphenol
structure; the depolymerized product contains very little Ru metal
and thus complies with food safety standards; the antioxidant properties
of both the depolymerized products and PPCs were better than those
of the commonly used antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol.
The relative molecular weight and steric hindrance of the depolymerized
products were lower than those of the PPCs, leading to better antioxidant
performance. A new technical route for the depolymerization of PPCs
from the L. gmelinii bark is provided.
The route offers practical and commercial advantages, and the product
could have many applications as an antioxidant.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Kuzen., a
member of the Pinaceae family, is the principal tree species of coniferous
forests in China’s Greater and Lesser Xing’an Mountains,
Changbai Mountains, Tianshan Mountains, and Yunnan Mountains and is
also wide spread in the Siberian region of Russia.1 During the cutting and processing of L.
gmelinii in these regions, bark and branches, which
account for 8–15% of the volume of the logs and can amount
to 94 000 tons per year, are typically viewed as a low-value
resource and used as fuel.2 The L. gmelinii bark does, however, contain potentially
useful phenolic compounds, including polymeric proanthocyanidins (PPCs),
which can account for 10–16% of the bark weight, together with
gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid.3 PPCs contain 9–10 sub units of catechin and epicatechin.4 The molecular structure of PCCs from the L. gmelinii bark is shown in Figure 1a. The PCCs, which contain (−)-epicatechin
(Figure 1b) and (+)-catechin
(Figure 1c) structural
units,5 have an average molecular weight
of about 2800 and an average polymerization degree of 9–10.6 The ratio of 2,3-cis ((−)-epicatechin)
to 2,3-trans ((+)-catechin) sub units is about 6:4.7

Figure 1 Molecular structure of PPCs from the L. gmelinii bark (a) PPCs; (b) (−)-epicatechin; (c) (+)-catechin.

PPCs with polymerization degree >5 account for
about 70% of the
total mass of phenolic compounds from the L. gmelinii bark.8 Because of their high polymerization
degree and high molecular weight, these PPCs are unable to penetrate
biological membranes effectively, limiting both their biological activity
and range of applications.9 Shorter oligomers
(dimers, trimers, and tetramers), which are often referred to as oligomeric
proanthocyanidins (OPCs),4 are powerful
antioxidants and very efficient free-radical scavengers. OPCs have
been reported to have protective or preventative functions in eye
disease, aging, cancer, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.1,3,6 Because of this, they potentially
have many applications in fields including medicines, cosmetics, and
health foods.10−12 The ability to depolymerize PPCs into OPCs would
thus improve their value and is an important research objective.

At present, depolymerization of PPCs is mostly carried out using
either microbial or chemical methods. Research into microbial depolymerization
has focused largely on screening transformed strains of microorganisms.13 The transformation products of these reactions
are, however, highly uncertain and it is difficult to obtain oligomers
with a specific polymerization degree. Conditions for chemical depolymerization
have been extensively studied.14 Depolymerization
requires cleavage of the C4–A8 bond (see Figure 1), which can be broken by metal-catalyzed
hydrogenolysis, using metals such as Pd, Ni, Fe, and Pt. Although
Pd-catalyzed hydrogenolysis, especially, has been shown to cleave
the C4–A8 bond in high yield, giving easily separable products,15 the high cost of Pd is a problem. Deng et al.16 have found that Ru, another group VIII metal
that is much cheaper than Pd, can also catalyze hydrogenolysis of
C–C bonds. The ability to use Ru as the catalyst for depolymerization
of PPCs from the L. gmelinii bark would,
therefore, be of both practical and commercial significance.

Here, the reaction conditions for 5% Ru/C-catalyzed depolymerization
of PPCs from the L. gmelinii bark,
including temperature, time, and catalyst loading, were optimized.
The depolymerization products were characterized by UV–vis,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), and 1H NMR spectroscopy,
as well as gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and their antioxidant
properties were measured. Levels of Ru metal in the depolymerization
products were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A technical
basis for the low-cost depolymerization and exploitation of PPCs from
the L. gmelinii bark has been provided,
and ways to improve the value of an undervalued resource have also
been explored.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Proposed Mechanism of Catalytic Depolymerization
of PPCs
In typical molecules of L. gmelinii bark PPCs, the inductive effect of the hydroxyl group at the 3-position
of the C-ring reduces the density of the electron cloud on the C-ring.
This leads to a partial positive charge at the 4-position and formation
of an electrophilic center. The hydroxyl groups at the 5- and 7-positions
of the A-ring have unshared lone pairs on the oxygen atoms, which
form a p−π conjugated system with the π electrons
of the benzene ring. The conjugation effect dominates, and the electron
cloud shifts to the benzene ring. The electron cloud density on the
benzene ring is increased to a greater extent at the position para
to the hydroxyl group (8-position) than at the position ortho to the
hydroxyl group (4-position). The 8-position on the A-ring is thus
strongly negatively charged, forming a nucleophilic center. Under
the conditions of catalytic hydrogenolysis, the C4–A8 bond
is easily broken42 and the PPCs are depolymerized
to give OPCs, together with catechin/epicatechin. The proposed mechanism
is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Diagram showing proposed mechanism of Ru-catalyzed depolymerization
of PPCs from the L. gmelinii bark.

2.2 Optimization of Hydrogenolysis
Conditions
2.2.1 Effect of Temperature
C–C
bonds are generally high energy bonds and cleavage requires catalyst,
high temperature, and high pressure or other harsh conditions. The
depolymerization reaction was, therefore, carried out under 3 MPa
hydrogen, with a Ru/C loading of 1.5% (g/mL), at 90, 120, 150, or
180 °C for 1 h. The effect of temperature on the depolymerization
rate of PPCs is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Effect of temperature on the depolymerization rate of
PPCs (3 MPa
hydrogen, 500 rpm stirring, reaction time of 1 h, and 1.5% catalyst
loading).

The depolymerization rate of PPCs
first increased and then decreased,
with increasing temperature. The depolymerization rate was highest
(68.8%) at 150 °C. When the depolymerization temperature is lower
than 150 °C, there is insufficient energy to break all the C4–A8
bonds. As the temperature increases, the number of broken chemical
bonds and the depolymerization rate increase. When the temperature
increases above 150 °C, however, the structural units of the
OPCs or monomers may be damaged, resulting in an apparent decrease
in the depolymerization rate. At the same time, the depolymerization
product is accompanied by a polymerization reaction, resulting in
a further reduction in the depolymerization rate. Overall, the best
temperature for depolymerization of PPCs was found to be 150 °C.

2.2.2 Effect of Reaction Time
Reaction
times of 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 h were investigated using 3 MPa hydrogen,
a Ru/C loading of 1.5% (g/mL), and a reaction temperature of 150 °C.
The effect of reaction time on the depolymerization rate of PPCs is
shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effect
of reaction time on depolymerization rate of PPCs (3 MPa
hydrogen, 500 rpm stirring, 150 °C, and 1.5% catalyst loading).

The depolymerization rate of PPCs first increased
and then decreased,
with increasing reaction time. The depolymerization rate was highest
(68.8%) with a reaction time of 1 h. When the depolymerization time
is less than 1 h, there is insufficient energy to break all of the
C4–A8 bonds. As the reaction time is gradually extended, the
number of broken chemical bonds and the depolymerization rate increase.
As the reaction time is increased further, however, the OPC product
or monomer units are destroyed, resulting in an apparent decrease
in the depolymerization rate. Also the depolymerization product is
also be accompanied by a polymerization reaction, resulting in a further
reduction in the depolymerization rate. Overall, the best reaction
time for depolymerization of PPCs was found to be 1 h.

2.2.3 Effect of Catalyst Loading
Ru/C
loadings of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2% (g/mL) were investigated using a hydrogen
pressure of 3 MPa, a reaction temperature of 150 °C, and a reaction
time of 1 h. The effect of catalyst loading on the depolymerization
rate of PPCs is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Effect of catalyst loading on the depolymerization rate
of PPCs
(3 MPa hydrogen, 500 rpm stirring, 1 h, and 150 °C).,

The depolymerization rate of PPCs first increased and then
decreased,
as the catalyst loading was increased. The depolymerization rate was
highest (74.1%) with 1% catalyst loading.

During catalytic hydrogenolysis,
H2, enters the liquid
phase, is adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst, and decomposes
to H+ radicals under Ru catalysis. The newly formed H+ radicals then participate in the C4–A8 bond breaking
reaction. When the catalyst loading is less than 1%, the contact area
between the catalyst and the reaction system is small, and the amount
of adsorbed H2 is small. Fewer H+ radicals are
formed, and the reaction efficiency is low, resulting in less C4–A8
bond cleavage and a lower depolymerization rate. When the catalyst
loading exceeds 1%, too many H+ radicals are formed, and
a homogeneous system cannot be produced. Oligomers or monomers formed
by depolymerization of the PPCs are destroyed, resulting in a low
apparent depolymerization rate. Overall, the best catalyst loading
for depolymerization of PPCs was found to be 1%.

Li et al.15 used Pd/C to catalyze the
depolymerization of sorghum proanthocyanidins. Compared with Pd/C,
a higher temperature was needed for depolymerization using Ru/C, but
a lower catalyst loading and shorter reaction time were required.
The depolymerization rate was improved by using Ru/C rather than Pd/C,
demonstrating that the use of lower cost Ru/C for depolymerization
of proanthocyanidins has an important practical value.

2.3 Structural Characterization of Proanthocyanidins
The
OPCs described below were obtained using 3 MPa hydrogen, 150
°C, 1 h, and 1% (g/mL) catalyst loading.

2.3.1 Analysis
of UV–Vis Absorption Spectra
The UV–vis absorption
spectra of the PPCs, OPCs, and catechins
are shown in Figure 6. The spectra of the PPCs, OPCs, and catechins all show large characteristic
absorption peaks at 210 nm, together with smaller peaks at 280 nm.
Taking into account the theory of UV absorption and the typical structural
formula of proanthocyanidins, we have attributed the absorption peaks
at 210 nm to the three conjugated double bonds of the benzene ring
and those at 280 nm to the conjugated structure of the A- and B-rings
of the proanthocyanidins. The peak intensity of PPCs at 280 nm is
significantly lower than that of OPCs and catechin, indicating that
the steric hindrance of PPCs is higher in the case of higher degree
of polymerization, resulting in a benzene ring, and the conjugate
effect is not obvious, so the peak intensity is weak. The degree of
OPCs polymerization is low, similar to catechin, and the steric hindrance
is small, and the conjugation effect is obvious, so the peak intensity
is high.45

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of PPCs,
OPCs, and catechins.

The UV–vis absorption
spectrum of the OPCs is similar to
that of the PPCs because both have a condensed flavanol polyphenol
structure, with similar basic structural units. Because the basic
structural units of both OPCs and PPCs are catechin and epicatechin,
the spectra of the proanthocyanidins are also similar to that of catechin.
The UV–vis absorption spectra clearly demonstrate that Ru/C-catalyzed
depolymerization does not destroy the basic structural unit of proanthocyanidins.

2.3.2 Analysis of FTIR Spectra
The FTIR
spectra of the PPCs and the OPCs are shown in Figure 7. The spectra are very similar, demonstrating
that the main characteristic functional groups of the proanthocyanidins
are unchanged by the depolymerization reaction. The strong absorption
peak at 3389 cm–1 is caused by the stretching vibration
associated with phenolic hydroxyl groups in the proanthocyanidin molecule,
the absorption peak at 2920 cm–1 is caused by the
antisymmetric stretching vibration of −CH2 groups,
the four absorption peaks at 1600, 1580, 1500, and 1450 cm–1 are caused by ring breathing vibrations of the benzene ring skeleton
C=C bonds, and the absorption peak at 1050 cm–1 is the stretching vibration peak of C–O–C groups.
In the fingerprint region, the peaks at 920–980 cm–1 are bending vibrations of C–H bonds on the benzene ring,
and the characteristic absorption peaks around 800 cm–1 are caused by out-of-plane deformation vibrations of unsaturated
C–H bonds on the aromatic ring skeleton.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra of PPCs
and OPCs.

The FTIR spectra of the PPCs and
OPCs are very similar and show
feature characteristic of condensed tannins, in agreement with theoretical
predictions.9,43,44 The similarity of the FTIR spectra further demonstrates that the
depolymerization reaction breaks the linkages between monomers but
does not affect the basic structural units of the proanthocyanidins.

2.3.3 Analysis of 1H NMR Spectra
The 1H NMR spectra of the OPCs and PPCs are shown in Figure 8. The spectra indicate
that both are polyphenols, with absorption peaks at 1.0 ppm (−CH3, −CH2), 2.5–2.6 ppm (Ar-OH), 3.5
ppm (−OCH3), 6.0–7.0 ppm (Ar-H), and 8.0–9.0
ppm (catechin phenolic OH).

Figure 8 1H NMR spectra of OPCs (top) and
PPCs (bottom).

The peak at 1.0 ppm (−CH3, −CH2) is much larger after depolymerization
because C4–A8 linkages
in the PPCs are broken, increasing the number of C–H bonds.
This is consistent with the proposed mechanism for Ru/C-catalyzed
depolymerization of L. gmelinii bark
PPCs.

The intensity of the 8–9 ppm peak of OPC is decreased.
The
reason for the conjecture is related to the change of the degree of
polymerization. PPCs belong to a mixture consisting of proanthocyanidins
of different degrees of polymerization with an average degree of polymerization
greater than 5. When depolymerization occurs, macromolecules in PPCs
are destroyed into molecules with low degree of polymerization, while
small molecules like catechin components are destroyed to form smaller
molecules, and this result in a lower concentration of catechin phenolic
OH in the OPCs in the spectrum than in PPCs. This result also confirms
our conjecture that if the reaction time is too long or the temperature
is too high, the proanthocyanidin molecules will be destroyed.

2.3.4 Determination of Molecular Weight of Proanthocyanidins
The molecular weight distribution curves of OPCs and PPCs are shown
in Figure 9. The molecular
weight distribution of the PPCs is mainly in the range 800–1800
g/mol, and the molecular weight distribution of the OPCs is mainly
in the range 200–1400 g/mol. The molecular weight of the depolymerized
product is significantly lower than that of PPCs, indicating that
Ru/C has efficiently catalyzed the depolymerization reaction.

Figure 9 Molecular weight
distribution of OPCs and PPCs determined by GPC.

2.3.5 Determination of the Ru Metal Content in
OPCs by XPS and ICP–MS
Heavy metal residues must be
rigorously controlled in antioxidants for use in foods (NO 629/008,
EU. GB 5009.12-2010, GB/T 5009.15-2003, GB/T 5009.17-2003, GB/T 5009.11-2003,
GB/T 5009.16-2003, GB/T 5009.138-2003, GB/T 5009.123-2003, Chinese
National Standard). Specifically, heavy metal content must be <0.2
mg/kg. The Ru metal content in OPCs was, therefore, determined by
XPS and ICP-MS. The XPS spectrum of OPCs (Figure 10), shows only C and O, and no Ru metal was
detected.

Figure 10 XPS spectrum of OPCs.

The ICP-MS method, which
has a lower detection limit than XPS,
indicated that the Ru metal content of the OPCs is 0.105 mg/kg. The
amount of Ru metal in the OPCs thus complies with international food
standards, and the OPCs can be safely used as food additives.

2.4 Antioxidant Activity of Proanthocyanidins
The antioxidant activity of OPCs should be higher than that of
PPCs because they are richer in phenolic hydroxyl groups. In this
section, the antioxidant activities of OPCs and PPCs were compared
with the antioxidant activity of the commonly used antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT).

2.4.1 Reducing
Ability
Reducing ability
is an important indicator of antioxidant activity because stronger
reducing ability is associated with greater antioxidant capacity.
The Prussian blue method was used to measure the reducing ability
of the proanthocyanidins because the phenolic hydroxyl groups and
ortho hydrogen atoms of the proanthocyanidins can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ under certain conditions. The change in Fe3+ concentration thus reflects the reducing ability of the
proanthocyanidins. As shown in Figure 11, the reducing ability of the OPCs increases
with increasing mass concentration over the range 0.025–0.2
mg/mL. At a mass concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, the absorbance values
of BHT, PPCs, and OPCs were 0.449, 0.557, and 1.013, respectively.
Both the OPCs and PPCs thus have higher reducing ability than BHT,
largely because of the powerful ability of the phenolic hydroxyl groups
and ortho hydrogen atoms in the proanthocyanidin structure to reduce
Fe3+. OPCs have higher reducing ability than PPCs mainly
because the OPCs have lower relative molecular mass, increased numbers
of hydrogen atoms, smaller steric hindrance, and more easily loses
hydrogen atoms.

Figure 11 Reducing ability of OPCs, PPCs, and BHT at different mass
concentrations.

2.4.2 DPPH• Scavenging Capacity
The 1,1-diphenyl-2-trinitrophenylhydrazyl
radical (DPPH•) scavenging capacity of PPCs and
OPCs was compared with that of
BHT. As shown in Figure 12, over the concentration range 0.025–0.2 mg/mL, the
order of DPPH• scavenging capacity was OPCs >
PPCs
> BHT. Compared with BHT, both PPCs and OPCs showed better DPPH• scavenging capacity. The scavenging capacity also
increased with increasing mass concentration. The scavenging activity
is attributed to the fact that the phenolic hydroxyl group and ortho
hydrogen atoms on the A- and B-rings of the proanthocyanidin molecule
(see Figure 1) act
as hydrogen donors, which can combine with free radicals to form stable
intramolecular hydrogen bonds, semi-quinone free radicals, or structures
such as o-benzoquinones, thereby blocking the free
radical chain reaction. OPCs have better DPPH• scavenging
capacity than PPCs because of their lower molecular weight and smaller
steric hindrance, combined with the greater reactivity of the A- and
B-ring phenolic hydroxyl groups and ortho hydrogen atoms.

Figure 12 DPPH• scavenging capacity of OPCs, PPCs, and
BHT at different mass concentrations.

2.4.3 ABTS•+ Scavenging Capacity
ABTS•+ scavenging capacity is commonly used to
indicate the total antioxidant capacity of antioxidants. 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) is oxidized to produce the relatively
stable blue-green radical cation ABTS•+, which has
a maximum absorption peak at 734 nm. The addition of antioxidants
inhibits the production of ABTS•+, resulting in
a lighter colored solution and a decrease in absorbance. The more
marked the change in the color of the solution, the higher the scavenging
rate and the stronger the antioxidant capacity.

As shown in Figure 13, the ABTS•+ scavenging capacity of OPCs, PPCs, and BHT increased
with increasing mass concentration over the range 0–0.2 mg/mL.
Both OPCs and PPCs are good antioxidants, with higher ABTS•+ scavenging ability than BHT. At the same mass concentration,
the order of ABTS•+ scavenging capacity was OPCs
> PPCs > BHT. OPCs have better ABTS•+ scavenging
activity than PPCs because their molecular weight is smaller, and
the phenolic hydroxyl group and ortho hydrogen atoms on the A and
B rings are more reactive. When the mass concentration exceeded 0.1
mg/mL, the degree of ABTS•+ radical scavenging had
reached saturation, and the scavenging capacity of all three antioxidants
was essentially the same.

Figure 13 ABTS•+ scavenging capacity
of OPCs, PPCs, and
BHT at different mass concentrations.

Because ABTS•+ scavenging capacity is often used
to indicate the total antioxidant capacity of antioxidants, we measured
the concentration at which the scavenging capacity of each antioxidant
was half maximal (IC50 value). As shown in Figure 14, the IC50 values
are in the order OPCs < PPCs < BHT. The IC50 value
of the OPCs obtained by catalytic hydrogenolysis using Ru/C as the
catalyst was 0.032 mg/mL, demonstrating that the depolymerized product
has the best total antioxidant performance.

Figure 14 ABTS•+ scavenging activity: IC50 values
of OPCs, PPCs, and BHT.

3 Conclusions
In this study, PPCs were extracted from L. gmelinii bark and depolymerized by catalytic hydrogenolysis,
using Ru/C as
the catalyst. Under the operating conditions investigated, the highest
depolymerization rate at 3 MPa hydrogen and 500 rpm stirring was obtained
at 150 °C, 1 h, and 1% catalyst loading. The results analyses
showed that the molecular weight of the depolymerized products was
significantly lower than that of PPCs. Both OPCs and PPCs are condensed
flavanol polyphenol structures, containing catechin or epicatechin
as the basic structural units. OPCs contain very little Ru metal and
meet food safety standards. Both OPCs and PPCs had good reducing ability
and DPPH• and ABTS•+ scavenging capacity.
The antioxidant properties of both OPCs and PPCs were better than
those of the commonly used antioxidant BHT. The OPCs have lower molecular
mass, lower steric hindrance, and superior resistance to oxidation
compared with the PPCs.

In summary, this study provides a new
method, with high practical
value, for the depolymerization of PPCs from L. gmelinii bark. The depolymerization products, which have better antioxidant
activity than the commonly used antioxidant, are likely to have many
applications in fields such as medicine, cosmetics, health foods,
and food preservation.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Reagents
A L. gmelinii bark (Tianjin Grace Environmental Technology
Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) was pulverized to particles with diameter
0.5–1.0 mm. The 5% Ru/C catalyst was purchased from Shaanxi
Kaida Chemical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Ethanol, petroleum ether
(boiling range 60–90 °C), ethyl acetate, ZrOCl2·8H2O, concentrated ammonia solution, silver nitrate,
phosphotungstic acid, (+)-catechin, vanillin, acetic acid, methanol,
potassium bromide, potassium ferricyanide, disodium hydrogen phosphate,
sodium dihydrogen phosphate, trichloroacetic acid, ferric chloride,
BHT, DPPH•, ABTS, and potassium persulfate were
all of analytical grade.

4.2 Extraction of PPCs
PPCs from L. gmelinii bark were extracted
using ethanol solution.17,18 Briefly, crushed L. gmelinii bark
(30 g) and 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (300 mL) were refluxed for 3
h in a water bath held at 80 °C and then filtered. The filtrate
was extracted with an equal volume of petroleum ether (boiling range
60–90 °C) to remove the resin from the extract phase.
After removal of resin, the ethanol and petroleum ether were evaporated
at 45 ± 5 °C under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator.
An insoluble red material was removed by filtration, and the resulting
aqueous solution was extracted three times with equal volumes of ethyl
acetate until the ethyl acetate layer was colorless to provide an
aqueous solution of PPCs and an organic solution of OPCs.3 The volume of the aqueous solution was reduced
to 50 mL using a rotary evaporator at 55 ± 5 °C, and the
PPCs (4.103 g) were finally obtained by drying at 45 ± 5 °C
in a vacuum oven.

4.3 Catalytic Hydrogenolysis
of PPCs
Experiments to determine the effects of catalyst
loading, temperature,
and reaction time on the hydrogenolysis were carried out using solutions
of L. gmelinii PPCs (0.1 g) in 70%
(v/v) aqueous ethanol (20 mL). Solutions were treated with different
amounts of 5% Ru/C catalyst, and reactions were carried out under
3 MPa hydrogen and19 stirred at 500 rpm
in a high pressure reactor (type GCF-1, China First Heavy Industries
Dalian Hydrogenation Reactor Co., Ltd., Dalian, China). Reactions
were carried out at different temperatures and for different lengths
of time. Temperature and pressure were held constant during the reaction
using the temperature controller and inlet and outlet valves, respectively,
of the high pressure reactor. When the reactions were complete, the
catalyst was removed by filtration through a filter membrane with
a pore size of 0.45 μm. The filtrates were then dried at 45
± 5 °C in a vacuum oven to give the OPCs.

4.4 Characterization of Polymerization Degree
of Proanthocyanidins
4.4.1 Principle of Determination
of Average Polymerization
Degree of Proanthocyanidins by the Vanillin-Hydrochloric Acid Method
When the reaction between vanillin-hydrochloric acid solution and
proanthocyanidins is carried out in acetic acid, vanillin reacts only
with flavanol units at the end of the proanthocyanidins, and the absorbance
is approximately proportional to the concentration of flavanol end
groups, providing conditions for quantitative detection.20 Whereas the traditional vanillin-hydrochloric
acid method, which is carried out in methanol, can be used to determine
the quality of proanthocyanidins,21 the
reaction in acetic acid can be used to determine the molar amount
of the proanthocyanidin. The average polymerization degree of proanthocyanidins
can be determined using a combination of these two methods.22,23 This test method can be used to measure the change of polymerization
degree before and after depolymerization of proanthocyanidins. The
UV–vis absorption spectra of proanthocyanidins, catechins,
and vanillin-hydrochloric acid solution have no obvious absorption
peak at 500 nm. When the proanthocyanidins or catechins are reacted
with vanillin-hydrochloride solution, however, a maximum absorption
peak appears at 500 nm.24,25 Selecting 500 nm as
the detection wavelength thus effectively avoids interference by other
absorption peaks.

4.4.2 Determination of Mass
Concentration of Proanthocyanidins
by the Vanillin-Hydrochloric Acid Method: Establishment of Catechin
Mass Concentration–Absorbance Curve
An initial solution
was prepared by accurately diluting catechin (20.4 mg) to 50 mL with
methanol in a volumetric flask. Aliquots (1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and
8.0 mL) of this solution were transferred to 10 mL volumetric flasks
and accurately diluted to 10 mL with methanol to provide standard
solutions. The mass concentrations of these standard solutions were
40.8, 81.6, 163.2, 244.8, and 326.4 μg/mL, respectively. Aliquots
(1.0 mL) of solutions with different mass concentrations were placed
in 10 mL light-proof tubes and reacted with a solution of vanillin
(0.5% w/v) and hydrochloric acid (4% v/v) in methanol (5 mL) at 30
°C for 30 min. Using methanol as a blank control, the absorbance
was measured at 500 nm using an UV–vis dual-beam UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Beijing Puxi General Instrument Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China) to establish a catechin mass concentration–absorbance
curve.22,26 Over the linear range of 0–350 μg/mL,
the relationship between the proanthocyanidin mass concentration y
(μg/mL) and the absorbance Abs was: y = 2.68x + 0.0038, with a linear relationship R2 = 0.9998.

4.4.3 Determination of Molar
Concentration of
Proanthocyanidins by Vanillin-Hydrochloric Acid Method: Establishment
of Catechin Molar Concentration–Absorbance Curve
An
initial solution was prepared by accurately diluting a solution of
catechin (3.2 mg) in methanol (1 mL) to 50 mL with acetic acid in
a volumetric flask. Aliquots (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mL) of this solution
were transferred to 10 mL volumetric flasks and accurately diluted
to 10 mL with acetic acid to provide standard solutions. The molar
concentrations of these standard solutions were 0.022, 0.056, 0.111,
0.167, and 0.223 μmol/mL, respectively. Aliquots (1.0 mL) of
standard solutions with different molar concentrations were placed
in 10 mL light-proof tubes and reacted with a solution of hydrochloric
acid (4% v/v) and vanillin (0.5% w/v) in acetic acid (5 mL) at 20
°C for 5 min. Using acetic acid as a blank control, the absorbance
was measured at 500 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer to
establish a catechin molar concentration–absorbance curve.25,27 Over the linear range of 0–0.25 μmol/mL, the relationship
between the proanthocyanidin molar concentration y (μmol/mL)
and the absorbance Abs was: y = 4.753x + 0.007, with a linear relationship R2 = 0.9986.

4.4.4 Determination of Polymerization
Degree of
Proanthocyanidins
An initial solution was prepared by accurately
diluting proanthocyanidins (0.0109 g) to 25 mL with methanol in a
volumetric flask. An aliquot (0.5 mL) of this solution was diluted
to 10 mL with methanol in a volumetric flask. An aliquot (1 mL) of
the diluted solution was removed using a pipette and the absorbance
was measured as described in Section 4.4.2. The mass concentration of proanthocyanidins
was then calculated using the catechin mass concentration–absorbance
curve. A second aliquot (0.5 mL) of the initial solution was diluted
to 10 mL with acetic acid in a volumetric flask. An aliquot (1 mL)
of the diluted solution was removed using a pipette, and the absorbance
was measured as described in Section 4.4.3. The molar concentration of proanthocyanidins
was then calculated using the catechin molar concentration–absorbance
curve.23,28−30

The average polymerization
degree (DP) of the proanthocyanidins was calculated31,32 by formula 1 1  

In formula 1, m is the mass concentration of proanthocyanidins, μg/mL; n is the molar concentration of proanthocyanidins, μmol/mL; M is the relative molecular mass of monomeric catechin,
290.27.

The extent of proanthocyanidin depolymerization is generally
expressed
as the depolymerization rate,33,34 calculated according
to formula 2 2  

In formula 2, DP0 is the polymerization
degree of undepolymerized proanthocyanidins
and DPx is the polymerization degree of
proanthocyanidins after depolymerization.

4.5 Characterization of Proanthocyanidins
4.5.1 UV–Vis
Absorption Spectra
Proanthocyanidin samples were dissolved
in 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol
at a concentration of 40 μg/mL. Spectra were recorded over the
wavelength range 200–800 nm using a TU-1950 dual-beam UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Beijing Puxi General Instrument Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China). Aqueous ethanol [70% (v/v)] was used as the blank.

4.5.2 FTIR Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra
were recorded using the KBr method. Mixtures of proanthocyanidins
(2 mg) and KBr (200 mg) were thoroughly ground together in an agate
mortar under infrared light and then pressed into discs. Spectra were
recorded using an FTIR-650 spectrometer (Tianjin Gangdong Technology
Development Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China), over the wavenumber range
400–4000 cm–1, at 2 cm–1 resolution and with 16 scans.

4.5.3 1H NMR Spectroscopy
Proanthocyanidins (30 mg) were
dissolved in DMSO-d6 (0.6 mL), and 1H NMR spectra were recorded
using an AVANCE III HD 500 MHz spectrometer [Bruker (Beijing) Scientific
Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing].

4.5.4 Determination
of Molecular Weight of Proanthocyanidins
Proanthocyanidins
(25 mg) were dissolved in 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol
(10 mL), and the solution was filtered through a filter membrane with
a pore size of 0.45 μm. The molecular weight distribution of
proanthocyanidins was measured using an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system
(Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with
two gel columns (types 79911GF-084 and 79911GF-083) and a diode array
detector. The operating parameters were: injection volume, 50 μL;
column temperature, 30 °C; and detection wavelength, 270 nm.
The mobile phase was 50% (v/v) aqueous methanol with a flow rate of
1.0 mL/min. The monodispersed standard is polyoxyethylene standard,
and the molecular weight is 106, 194, 400, 620, 1010, 4020, 1900,
6450, 11 840, and 22 450.

4.5.5 Characterization
Using XPS
XPS
spectra of proanthocyanidins were recorded using a K-Alpha X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), with the following conditions:
Ag 3d5/2 resolution, 0.85 eV half peak width, 0–1350
eV binding energy range, Al target, X-ray maximum 12 kV, and 30 mA.

4.5.6 Characterization Using ICP-MS
Proanthocyanidins
(100 mg) and HNO3 (3 mL) were mixed in a pressure digestion
tank and covered overnight. The stainless steel jacket was then screwed
into place, and the samples were digested in a constant temperature
oven at 80, 120 or 160 °C for 2 h, until the solutions were clear
and transparent. After cooling, the solutions were removed from the
digestion tank, heated on a 100 °C hot plate for 30 min, and
then diluted to 10 mL with pure water. A blank test was necessary.

The heavy metal content of the digested solutions was measured
using a NexION 350D ICP-MS instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
The operating conditions were as follows: RF power, 1600 W; plasma
gas flow, 18.00 L/min; auxiliary gas flow, 1.20 L/min; nebulizer flow,
0.92 mL/min; sample cone, 1.1 mm; intercepting cone, 0.8 mm; amu (10%
peak height) resolution, 0.6–0.7; acquisition mode, jump peak
data; analysis time, 3 min; and number of repeat measurements, 3.

4.6 Antioxidant Properties of Proanthocyanidins
Initial solutions were prepared by accurately diluting proanthocyanidins
(10 mg) to 10 mL with 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol in a volumetric flask.
Sample solutions were prepared by transferring aliquots (0.25, 0.5,
1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mL) of the initial solution by pipette to 10 mL
volumetric flasks and diluting with 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. The
sample solutions prepared in this way had mass concentrations of 0.025,
0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mg/mL.

4.6.1 Reducing
Ability
Aliquots (1.0
mL) of proanthocyanidin sample solutions with different mass concentrations
were placed in centrifuge tubes. The samples were treated with 0.2
M sodium phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, pH 6.6) and 1% (w/v) potassium
ferricyanide solution (2.5 mL) and allowed to react in a water bath
at 50 °C for 20 min. A solution of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic
acid (2.5 mL) was then added, and the mixtures were centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 min. An aliquot (2.5 mL) of the supernatant was placed
in a light-proof tube and mixed thoroughly with deionized water (2.5
mL) and 0.1% (w/v) ferric chloride solution (1 mL). After standing
for 10 min, the absorbance was measured at 700 nm using a UV–vis
spectrophotometer.35−37 The reducing ability of BHT was measured using the
same method for comparison.

4.6.2 DPPH•-scavenging capacity
DPPH• (20 mg) was accurately diluted to 500 mL
with ethanol in a volumetric flask, and the resulting solution was
stored in the dark. Solutions of proanthocyanidins (0.25 mL) with
different mass concentrations were placed in light-proof tubes and
thoroughly mixed with DPPH• solution (4.75 mL).
After standing at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, absorbance
was measured at 517 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer, with
70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol as the blank control.38,39 The DPPH•-scavenging capacity of BHT was measured
using the same method for comparison. The DPPH• scavenging
rate was calculated according to formula 3 3  

In formula 3, A0 is the absorption
of the control solution at 517 nm and Ax is the absorption of the sample solution at 517
nm.

4.6.3 ABTS•+-Scavenging Capacity
A solution of ABTS (38.5 mg) in deionized water (10 mL) was treated
with potassium persulfate (6.6 mg) and allowed to stand at 30 °C
for 12 h in the dark to form a blue-green solution of the radical
cation ABTS•+. The ABTS•+ solution
was diluted with sodium acetate solution (20 mM, pH 4.5) to give an
absorbance of 0.70 ± 0.02 at a wavelength of 734 nm.

Aliquots
(0.25 mL) of proanthocyanidin solutions with different mass concentrations
were mixed with ABTS•+ (4.75 mL) in light-proof
tubes. After standing at room temperature for 6 min in dark, absorbance
was measured at 734 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer, with
70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol as the blank sample.40,41 The ABTS•+-scavenging capacity of BHT was measured
using the same method for comparison.

The ABTS•+-scavenging rate was calculated according
to formula 4 4  

In formula 4, A0 is the absorption
of the control solution
at 734 nm and Ax is the
absorption of the sample solution at 734 nm.
