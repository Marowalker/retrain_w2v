The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1
is correlated with the progression
of cervical cancer via regulating numerous oncogenic and tumor suppressor
pathways. p65 is a crucial regulator of tumorigenesis that is regulated
by Pin1, and p65 signaling suppression can enhance the antitumor efficacy
of doxorubicin (DOX). Here, we utilized a structural mimicry approach
to synthesize a series of dibenzothiophene analogues and evaluated
their ability to inhibit Pin1 activity. Compound 1a was
identified as a potent Pin1 inhibitor that inhibited p65 signaling
in vitro and in cervical cancer cells. Moreover, compound 1a enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX in cervical cancer cells via reducing
p65 nuclear accumulation and enhancing DOX uptake. These compounds
are promising scaffolds for developing more potent Pin1 inhibitors
against cervical cancer, either alone or in combination with anticancer
drugs such as DOX.

==== Body
Introduction
Cervical cancer is
the third most common malignancy among women
and the second most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide.1 Surgical resection and radiotherapy are the standard
of care for the treatment of cervical cancer, however, patients with
advanced tumors frequently fail to respond to treatments.2,3 Targeted therapy is an attractive approach to treat advanced tumors.
However, blocking only a single pathway is often insufficient to eradicate
advanced tumors, especially aggressive or drug-resistant tumors because
of the activation of redundant and/or alternative oncogenic pathways.4,5 In cervical cancer, the dysregulation of numerous oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes are often mediated through phosphorylation
events. Pin1 is a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that is correlated with
the progression of cervical cancer by regulating numerous signal pathways
via phosphorylation.6,7 In cancer cells, overexpression
of Pin1 promotes numerous tumor oncogenes, including the p65 subunit
of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), by catalyzing the cis–trans
isomerization of pSer/Thr-Pro motifs.8 This
has stimulated the development of Pin1 inhibitors for the potential
treatment of cancer, including cervical cancer.9 Examples of Pin1 small-molecule inhibitors reported in
the literature include a shikimic acid derivative discovered by virtual
screening,10 a naphthoquinone juglone derivative
found in walnut trees,11 and a covalent
Pin1 inhibitor KPT-6566.12PiB, a fused tetracyclic tetraone, inhibited Pin1 and suppressed the
growth of cancer cells.10,13,14 However, to date, existing Pin1 inhibitors are unable to efficiently
enter cells to inhibit Pin1 function in vivo. All-trans retinoic acid
is the only Pin1 inhibitor that has had some successes in clinical
use, being approved for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.5 Thus, new Pin1 inhibitors to treat cervical cancers
are urgently desired. In addition, Pin1 might be a potential target
for potentiating the potency of existing anticancer drugs. Knockdown
of Pin1 enhanced the sensitivity of HeLa cells to cisplatin, while
Pin1 overexpression led to an adverse effect.15 Other reports have shown that inhibition of p65 translocation can
enhance doxorubicin (DOX)-induced apoptosis in carcinoma cells by
the increase of intracellular DOX.16−19 DOX is a broad-spectrum antitumor
drug that is used for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. However,
the cardiotoxicity of DOX limits its clinical use.20−23 Therefore, the discovery of new
Pin1 inhibitors that can target Pin1 to inhibit p65 might be a potential
strategy to potentiate the activity of DOX in cervical cancer.

Results
and Discussion
A 3-fluorophenylalanine derivative containing
a benzothiophene
group inhibited Pin1 in vitro with nanomolar potency but was inactive
in cells.24 The benzothiophene motif was
also present in a non-natural peptide inhibitor of Pin1, which bound
to the Pin1 active site with high specificity and potency but yet
also showed no effect in cells.25 Although
benzothiophene motifs are frequently present in prodrugs, and the
benzothiophene core appears sufficiently hydrophobic that one might
expect that it would pass through cell membranes,26,27 and the phosphate group present in these two benzothiophene-containing
compounds might have impaired cellular permeability, leading to reduced
cellular activity. To overcome this issue, we considered the addition
of the imidazole motif, which is known to increase the cell permeability
of many existing drugs.28,29 The ionizable property
of the imidazole group confers favorable electronic characteristics
that mediates cell penetration as well as supramolecular interactions
with specific biological targets.30−39 Therefore, in our rational design strategy, three groups (1–3) of compounds containing the dibenzothiophene and
imidazole motifs (Figure 1) were synthesized through the carbon–nitrogen Ullmann
coupling reaction, followed by the oxidation of the benzothiophene
motif and subsequent quaternarization of the imidazole group. All
compounds 1a–e possess imidazole substituents
at the C4 position of the dibenzothiophene scaffold. Compounds 2a–c increase the aromatic bulk of the C4 group by
changing from imidazole to benzimidazole. Finally, compounds 3a–c have the imidazole substituent at the C2 position
instead of at C4.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of compounds 1a–3c.

These compounds were subsequently
tested at 100 μM for their
ability to decrease Pin1 activity using a PPIase activity assay. Based
on the PPIase activity assay results (Figure 2), a preliminary structure–activity
relationship (SAR) analysis could also be performed. Quaternarization
of compounds generally led to improved Pin1 inhibitory activity, except
in the case of the benzimidazole-substituent series where the neutral
compound 2a was most active. This suggests that electronic
properties may play an important role in guiding the compounds to
the active site of the protein. Compound 1a, bearing
a benzyl substituent on the imidazole group, was superior to compound 1b (methyl substituent) and 1d (ethyl substituent),
suggesting that the substitution pattern on the imidazole group was
important for activity. The C2-substituted compounds 3a–c (average inhibition: 49.5%) were generally inferior to the C4-substituted
compounds 1a–e (average inhibition: 70.4%), suggesting
that the steric effect of the imidazole motif was important for determining
bioactivity. Moreover, sulfoxides were generally superior to (e.g., 1b vs 1e, 2c vs 2b,
or 3a vs 3c), indicating that the oxidation
state of the dibenzothiophene scaffold is also important. Finally,
the methylimidazolium iodide salts were more active than the neutral
imidazole compounds (e.g., 1b. vs 1c, 3c vs 3b), with the exception of salt 2c which was slightly less potent than the neutral benzimidazole 2a.

activity assay. Error bars represent standard deviation of the means
of the results from three independent experiments.

Among the tested compounds, compound 1a was considered
to be the most promising Pin1 antagonist as it inhibited Pin1 activity
by 80% at 100 μM (Figure 2). A dose–response experiment indicated an EC50 value of ca. 5 μM for compound 1a, which was
comparable with PiB which showed an EC50 value
of ca. 10 μM under parallel conditions (Figure S2). The synthesis of compound 1a is shown
in Scheme 1. The compound
displayed high stability in DMSO-d6 for
up to 7 days as shown by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1).

Pin1 is overexpressed in several kinds of cancer, and
ablation
of Pin1 activity can reduce tumor growth.12 To evaluate the effects of compound 1a in cellulose,
we first explored whether Pin1 is engaged by 1a in HeLa
cell lysates. The cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) was performed
to quantify the extent of drug engagement to Pin1 within HeLa cell
lysates. After lysates of HeLa cells were incubated with compound 1a for 1 h, the aliquots were heated at different temperatures
ranging from 45 to 70 °C for 8 min. The level of Pin1 remaining
in the soluble fraction was determined by Western blotting. In the
results, compound 1a increased Pin1 stability compared
to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control (ΔTm: 1a: 8.8 °C), suggesting that compound 1a can engage Pin1 even in the complex biochemical environment
of the cellular lysates (Figure 3a,b). A dose experiment with compound 1a (0–100 μM) revealed a Kd value of 5.7 μM for Pin1 protein at 61 °C (Figure S3).

Figure 3 Compound 1a (100 μM)
stabilizes Pin1 in HeLa
cell lysates as determined by CETSA. (a) Pin1 content in the soluble
fraction as revealed by Western blotting. (b) Plot of band intensity
of Pin1 in the soluble fraction against temperature. The data were
normalized to the Pin1 level of the control group at 45 °C and
are expressed as the means ± SEM of three individual experiments.

Next, the effect of compound 1a against the proliferation
of cancer cells and normal cells was assessed. Cervical cancer (HeLa)
cells and normal liver (LO2) cells were treated with different doses
of compound 1a for 72 h. The results showed that compound 1a decreased the cell viability of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent
manner, with an IC50 value of 9.4 μM (Figure S4a), while it showed lower cytotoxicity
in normal cells with an IC50 value of 39.8 μM (Figure S5). To further explore whether the cytotoxicity
of compound 1a in HeLa cells was due to Pin1 inhibition,
Pin1 knockdown was performed using siRNA. Notably, compound 1a showed reduced cytotoxicity (IC50 > 100 μM)
in HeLa cells after Pin1 knockdown compared with normal HeLa cells
(Figure S4a). In addition, we transfected
Pin1 plasmid10 into embryonic kidney (293T)
cells to generate a Pin1-overexpressing cell line. Intriguingly, compound 1a showed higher cytotoxicity in transfected 293T cells compared
with nontransfected 293T cells (Figure S4b). Finally, compound 1a had no effect on the Pin1 content
in HeLa cells after 12 h (Figure S7), suggesting
that the inhibition of cell viability was not dependent on alteration
of Pin1 expression levels. Taken together, these results suggest that
compound 1a induces cell death, at least partly, due
to the inhibition of Pin1 activity.

In cancer cells, Pin1 regulates
numerous tumor suppressors and
oncogenes by catalyzing the cis–trans isomerization of pSer/Thr-Pro
motifs.8 p65, as a subunit of the transcription
factor NF-κB, is a crucial regulator of many physiological and
pathophysiological processes, including control of the adaptive and
innate immune responses, inflammation, proliferation, tumorigenesis,
and apoptosis.40 Although small-molecule
NF-κB inhibitors have been tested as anticancer drugs either
alone or in combination with classical chemotherapeutics to counteract-activated
NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic behaviors, most of these target
IKK, the negative regulator of NF-κB.40 It is not desirable to block NF-κB signaling for prolonged
periods of time because the transcription factor also plays an important
role in the maintenance of host defense responses. Therefore, intervening
selectively with p65 transcriptional activity without completely blocking
NF-κB activation might be a superior strategy for therapeutic
intervention.

The unique substrate specificity of Pin1 toward
specific pSer/Thr-Pro
motifs is controlled by its C-terminal PPIase domain and N-terminal
WW domain. Pin1 binds and isomerizes the pThr254-Pro motif of p65,
resulting in enhanced p65 stabilization and nuclear accumulation,
which is associated with human malignancies.41 Thus, we hypothesized that the inhibition of Pin1 activity to interrupt
the Pin1–p65 interaction may represent a potential anticancer
strategy. Encouragingly, 1a disrupted the binding of
Pin1 to p65 in HeLa cells as observed by an immunoprecipitation assay
(Figure 4a) and also
decreased the accumulation of phosphor-p65(Thr254) levels in the nucleus
(Figure 4b). Moreover,
a half-life assay was performed to evaluate p65 stability. After incubation
of HeLa cells with compound 1a (10 μM) for 12 h,
cells were treated with 50 mg/mL cycloheximide, an antibiotic that
inhibits new protein biosynthesis, for different time periods and
p65 protein levels were analyzed. The results showed that with compound 1a, the half-life of p65 was about 180 min, whereas only about
20% of p65 was degraded after 180 min in the absence of compound 1a (Figure S6). This result suggests
that compound 1a could reduce the stability of p65 and
promote its degradation in HeLa cells, which we presume is related
to its ability to target Pin1 activity.41 To expand our investigation beyond p65, we also measured the protein
levels of other Pin1 substrates including Erk1/2, c-Jun, and PKM2.
Compound 1a reduced Erk1/2, c-Jun, and PKM2 protein levels
in HeLa cells (Figure S7a), phenocopying
Pin1 ablation with Pin siRNA10 (Figure S7b). This result suggests that compound 1a could impact multiple oncogenic pathways controlled by
Pin1 in order to exert its anticancer effects.

Figure 4 Inhibition of Pin1–p65
interaction in cells: (a) 1a suppressed the Pin1–p65
interaction in HeLa cells as revealed
by co-immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were treated with the indicated
concentration of 1a for 12 h. Protein lysates were incubated
with antip65 and magnetic beads. The precipitated proteins were revealed
by Western blotting with anti-Pin1 antibodies. 20% protein lysates
were labeled as input were revealed by Western blotting with anti-p65
and anti-GAPDH antibodies. (b) 1a decreased the nuclear
phospho-p65 level and had no effect on the cytoplasmic p65 level in
HeLa cells.

The therapeutic efficacy
of many anticancer drugs is limited by
their adverse effects on healthy cells.15,42,43 Combination therapies may improve efficacy and lower
toxicity allowing anticancer drugs to be utilized as lower dosages.44,45 DOX, an anthracycline derivative, is used for the treatment of a
variety of malignancies including cervical cancer because of its broad
spectrum antitumor activity.20−22,46,47 Inhibition of NF-κB activation attenuates
resistance to DOX.22 Thus, we hypothesized
that compound 1a could be combined with DOX to improve
its efficacy and decrease adverse effects on healthy cells. Using
the MTT assay,48−50 compound 1a was found to improve DOX
efficacy in HeLa cells with combination index (CI) <1, suggesting
synergism between compound 1a and DOX (Figure 5). Considering Pin1 contributes
to cisplatin resistance in cervical cancer,15 we also measured the combination cytotoxicity of cisplatin with
compound 1a. However, no synergistic effect was found
(Figure S8). To further investigate the
mechanism of cytotoxicity efficacy enhancement of DOX by compound 1a, we monitored p65 accumulation in treated HeLa cells. DOX
increased p65 accumulation in the nucleus, while cotreatment with 1a reversed this effect (Figure S9). Moreover, 1a had no effect on the drug resistance-related
protein P-glycoprotein (Figure S9). This
suggests that the improvement of DOX efficacy by 1a may
be related to its ability to suppress nuclear accumulation of p65.
Additionally, 1a could increase the intracellular accumulation
of DOX in HeLa cells, as revealed by an increase of DOX autofluorescence
in cells cotreated with compound 1a and DOX (Figure S10). Flow cytometric analysis also showed
that compound 1a augmented the intracellular concentration
of Dox (Figure S11), suggesting that the
improvement of DOX efficacy in HeLa cells may also be attributed to
enhanced DOX accumulation by 1a. Overall, 1a acts as an enhancer of DOX efficacy in HeLa cells, which we presume
is related to its ability to enhance intracellular DOX accumulation
while lowering p65 accumulation in the nucleus. These findings suggest
that 1a, when combined with low doses of DOX, has the
potential to provide more efficient therapeutic effects against cervical
cancer with lower general toxicity.

Figure 5 1a enhances DOX efficacy.
HeLa cells were treated
with DOX in the presence or absence of 1a for 72 h, and
cell viability was measured using the MTT. CI values are calculated.
D1 and D2 are the concentrations of 1a and DOX used in
the combination, and DLX,1 and DLX,2 are the
concentrations of a single drug to produce the same effect.

Conclusions
In summary, this study
has identified compound 1a as
a Pin1 inhibitor for potential cervical cancer therapy. Compound 1a was identified using a preliminary PPIase activity screening
of an in-house library of 11 compounds (1a–3c)
containing benzothiophene and imidazole motifs. Preliminary SAR analysis
indicated that quaternarization of the imidazole group, the nature
of the imidazole substituent, and oxidation level of the dibenzothiophene
scaffold were all determinants of Pin1 activity. In terms of mechanism,
we demonstrated that compound 1a can interrupt the interaction
between Pin1 and p65, thus reducing p65 nuclear accumulation and inhibiting
the growth of HeLa cells. Moreover, compound 1a showed
synergistic activity with DOX via reducing p65 accumulation and enhancing
DOX uptake, which could allow the anticancer drug to be used at lower
and safer dosages. To our knowledge, 1a represents the
first Pin1 inhibitor for cervical cancer therapy. We anticipate that
compound 1a may function as a novel scaffold for further
development of more potent Pin1 inhibitors against Pin1-overexpressing
cancers such as cervical cancer.
