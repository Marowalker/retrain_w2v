Variability control over the resistive
switching process is one
of the key requirements to improve the performance stability of the
resistive random access memory (RRAM) devices. In this study, we show
the improvement of the variability of the resistive switching operation
in the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer RRAM devices. The achievement is based on the thickness
engineering of the Al2O3 layer. A thick Al2O3 dielectric actively takes part to control the
resistive switching behavior; on the contrary, the ultrathin layer
of Al2O3 behaves as the tunnel barrier in the
structure. At lower voltage, the low resistance state conductions
follow the trap-assisted tunneling and Fowler–Nordheim tunneling
for the thick and thin Al2O3 RRAMs, respectively.
Finally, the variation control in device forming, SET voltage distribution,
high resistance state, low resistance state, and resistance ratio
is achieved with the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer RRAM devices by interfacial band engineering
with an ultrathin Al2O3 dielectric material.

1 Introduction
Advancement
of nonvolatile memories in device scaling with amplified
performance adds to the prospect of enhancing the horizon of new applications.1,2 The physical and practical limitations are busting the distinct
and individual alternatives with exciting architectures.3−5 Attractive resistive random access memory (RRAM) in a simple metal–insulator–metal
form is an emerging device in which electrical resistance (R) can be rearranged within the high resistance state (HRS)
and the low resistance state (LRS).6 Several
features such as simple design, low power operation, excellent scalability,
and so forth make the RRAM an important candidate for future nonvolatile
memory technology.7 The RRAM devices are
equally useful for ultrahigh density memory application as well as
for a brain-inspired computing system.8−11 In any form of the application,
stable resistive switching (RS) is a basic need for the successful
implementation of RRAM devices in real life.12,13 So far, uniformity in RS operation or, in other words, variability
control of the RRAM devices is one of the major concerns. On the other
hand, the material is a vital part to design RS devices. There are
several established materials such as HfO2,14,15 Ta2O5,16,17 TiO2,18,19 Al2O3,20,21 and so forth that are
capable of executing good RS in the RRAM devices. These RS devices
are further categorized in the electrochemical memory type or valance
change memory (VCM) type following the conducting nanofilament (CNF)
formation in the RRAM based on cation migration or anion migration.22 It is really difficult to control the formation
of CNF at each RS operation. The RS variation over cycles is a common
phenomenon in RRAMs. Several reports show that the improvement of
switching uniformity is possible by structure engineering with external
doping,23,24 inserting nanocrystals (NCs) in the switching
stack,25,26 annealing the RRAM,27 and also by controlling proper operating conditions.28,29 Improvement of the TiO2 RRAM by inserting Ru–NCs
is possible by choosing proper thickness for the NCs for the right
location.30 Misha et al.24 had reported the improvement of the TaOx RRAM by nitrogen doping after going through several trial
and error processes with various doping concentrations. Annealing
can improve the variability control, but at the same time, it can
increase the thermal budget and the fabrication cost of the RRAM.
Banerjee et al.21 had reported that the
improvement of the RS operation is possible by choosing appropriate
polarity for the applied bias. Therefore, it is concluded that the
variability improvement is possible after going through heartfelt
efforts which is time-consuming and at the same time increasing the
overall fabrication and operation cost. The need of time describes
the fact that it is an important task to find out a simple way to
improve the uniformity of the RS behavior of RRAM devices with a simple
CMOS-friendly stack design which can be implemented for the further
nonvolatile memory applications.

In this work, we have investigated
the simple, cost-effective,
time-saving process to improve the variability of TiOx/Al2O3-based VCM-type RRAM
devices. As the name suggests, the CNF in the devices is based on
the oxygen vacancy (VO)-type anion migration process. In
our previous work, we have reported the high-compliance current-dependent
Magneli-type CNF formation in the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer.8 In this work, the design was started with an 8 nm thick Al2O3 film and ultimately scaled to an ultrathin 2 nm Al2O3 interfacial layer. The 8 nm thick Al2O3 film actively takes part in the RS process, but the
2 nm Al2O3 with a natural large barrier height
plays a major role as a tunnel barrier at the interface. The role
of Al2O3 as a tunnel barrier material is well-established.31,32 The variability control in device’s forming voltage, operation
voltage, HRS, LRS, and resistance ratio (ζ = HRS/LRS) has been
achieved with the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer RRAM devices by interfacial band engineering with
an ultrathin Al2O3 dielectric material.

2 Results
2.1 Effect of Interfacial Al2O3 Layer Thicknesses on the RS Performances
The bright-field
scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images of the TiN/TiOx/Al2O3/IrOx RRAM stack is shown in Figure 1a. The TiN layer is employed as a word line
(WL) and IrOx as a bit line (BL). The
elemental mapping of the RRAM is shown in Figure 1b–e for Ti, N, O, and Al, respectively.
Details of the device fabrication had been discussed in our previous
works.8,10 The interfacial Al2O3 layer was engineered with thickness variation. Three types of devices
can be identified as S1, S2, and S3 for 8, 5, and 2 nm of Al2O3, respectively. The stack design is confirmed by the
high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) analysis
using a JEOL JEM2100F TEM instrument. Figure 1f shows HRTEM images with different thicknesses
of Al2O3 layers. The thickness of TiOx is ∼8 nm for all structures. The thicknesses
of Al2O3 are found to be ∼8, ∼5,
and ∼2 nm, for S1, S2, and S3 RRAMs, respectively. Figure 1g shows the line
scan image and compositions of the S3 RRAM. Interdiffusion of Al2O3 in TiOx is observed
in the fabricated devices. The intermixing (TiOx + Al2O3) oxide is of the Magneli type.8 After the fabrication processes, the devices
were maintained in an initial HRS. Device forming is necessary for
the initial distribution of VOs in the RRAM devices. For
an easy understanding of the behavior, performance improvement, and
the effect of Al2O3 layer thickness, we discuss
electrical performances of different structures one by one. To initiate
the RS process, the 8 nm Al2O3-based S1 RRAM
devices need an initial forming voltage of ∼14 ± 2.731
V. The device-to-device statistical distribution of the forming voltage
is shown in Figure S1a. A positive voltage
was applied to the BL during the forming processes, and the current
level was fixed at 100 μA. After the initial forming, the continuous
RS cycles were measured. Figure 2a shows 100 consecutive RS operations with a positive
voltage sweep. The HRS of the S1 RRAM was swept to a comparative LRS
with applied voltage from 0 V → +7 V, and the switching process
is known as the SET process. The 1st cycle of the process is indicated
with a solid circle, and the 100th cycle is indicated with an open
circle. The RS direction is indicated with an arrow. After each positive
voltage operation, a negative voltage was applied to the BL. Figure 2b shows the 100 consecutive
RS operations with a negative voltage sweep. The LRS of the S1 RRAM
was swept to a comparative HRS with an applied voltage from 0 V →
−3 V and the switching process is known as the RESET process.
The arrow indicates the RS direction. The SET transition is possible
because of the formation of the VO CNF, and the RESET transition
is possible because of the rupture of the CNF. The continuous 100
RS cycles depict a nonuniform nature of the CNF in the S1 RRAM. The
difference in the 1st cycle and the 100th cycle is quite visible.
In the first cycle, the transition from the HRS to the LRS is dominant
with one jump from the HRS to the LRS. However, at the 100th cycle,
several intermediate jumps change the current from the HRS to the
LRS. To understand it more clearly, the cycle-to-cycle variations
from the HRS to the LRS are shown in Figure S2. The sudden jumps of resistances are marked with numbers such as
①, ②, ③, and ④. The probability of the
CNF broken in two or three places is higher than that of the CNF broken
in a single place. Before and after a certain jump, the current always
increases; that is, the resistance always decreases with increasing
voltages from the HRS to the LRS. Figure 3a shows the resistance versus voltage (R–V) plot of the 100th cycle. Before
reaching the LRS, the HRS arrives at several intermediate resistance
states at 8 MΩ, 1.5 MΩ, and 300 kΩ that are marked
with R1, R2, and R3, respectively. The inset of Figure 3a shows the continuous tunneling (CT) effect
at the R3 state of the S1 RRAM. After reaching a resistance of 180
kΩ, the final jump of the resistance switches the device to
its LRS at 50 kΩ. Different devices show a similar kind of nature. Figure 3b shows the 100th
cycle from 10 randomly chosen S1 RRAMs. All these measurements show
that the SET transitions of the S1 RRAM are possible by connecting
several broken (likely two to three) CNFs, where charges are transferred
by CT followed by discrete tunneling (DT) processes.

based on the
CT and DT for (a,b) S1 RRAM and (c) S2 RRAM. The broken pieces of
CNF are more prominent in the S1 RRAM. (d) S3 RRAM shows a CT nature.

The RS in S2 and S3 RRAMs is a
little different than the RS in
the S1 RRAM. However, the S2 and S3 RRAMs also need an initial forming
step. The device-to-device statistical distribution of the forming
voltage is plotted in Figure S1b,c for
the S2 and S3 RRAMs, respectively. Similar forming conditions were
maintained during measurements. On average, forming voltages of ∼12.3
± 2.002 and ∼9.6 ± 0.914 V are necessary for the
S2 and S3 RRAMs, respectively. After the forming process, the current–voltage
(I–V) switching of the S2
RRAM is shown in Figure 3c. The switching from the HRS to the LRS shows a jump at the voltage
of ∼+4 V, followed by a gradual increase in current to the
compliance level. In the inset of Figure 3c, the R–V plot of the sudden jump illustrates a change of the higher
resistance of 3 MΩ at point A to the lower resistance of 170
kΩ at point B. After B, the resistance further decreases to
the LRS of the device (∼50 kΩ). Unlike S1, S2 RRAM devices
might have fewer broken places of CNF. However, no such sudden jump
was observed for the S3 RRAM. As shown in Figure 3d, the I–V and R–V shows
the continuous increasing and decreasing nature of the I and R, respectively.

Apart from the switching
nature, the changes among different RRAM
structures are also observed in the device’s operating parameters,
resistance states, and resistance ratio. Figure 4a shows the voltage to SET (VSET) plotting to show the cycle-to-cycle variation and
also device-to-device variation within the same frame. Five devices
for each structure were measured for 103 cycles each. The VSET values are found to be ∼5.4 ±
0.92, 4.5 ± 0.40, and 3.5 ± 0.28 V, for S1, S2, and S3,
respectively. A large variation of the voltage is observed for the
8 nm Al2O3 S1 RRAM devices. The VSET of the device decreases with the decrease of the thickness
of the Al2O3 layer. A good control of the variation
is achieved for the S3 RRAM devices as compared to the S1 and S2.
The systematic study shows that the resistance states are also different
for S1, S2, and S3. Although the scaling symmetry was missing for
the LRS, the HRS changed in a fashion similar to that shown in Figure S3. On average, the lower LRS and HRS
variations of the S3 RRAM devices are due to the ultrathin 2 nm Al2O3 interface. The variability control can be observed
in the ζ, as shown in Figure 4b. The devices show ζ values of ∼21, 13,
and 10 for the S1, S2, and S3 RRAM, respectively. However, larger
variations of ζ dominate the S1 RRAM rather than the S3 RRAM.
This variability control might be due to the interfacial engineering
with the ultrathin Al2O3 dielectric layer, which
will be discussed in detail in the Discussion part.

2.2 Variability
and Endurance Dilemma
The performances of the S1, S2, and
S3 devices are listed in Table 1. On the basis of
the achievements, the performances are graphically represented in Figure 5a. The variability
of three parameters, that is, forming voltage (VFORM), VSET, and ζ are plotted
together. Figure S4 shows the surface plot
of the overall variability. Ignoring the larger cycle-to-cycle or
device-to-device nonuniformity in RS, the S1 RRAM is capable of showing
good endurance cycles as compared to the S3 RRAM. Figure 5b shows the pulse test data
of the cyclability of the S1 and S3 devices. A similar HRS degradation
trend is followed by the S1 and S3 RRAMs. During the SET process of
the S1 RRAM, the applied pulse was +5.5 V@500μs, and the RESET
pulse was −3.0 V@10 ms. In the S1 RRAM, the continuous cycles
increase the trapping probability of the TiOx/Al2O3 stack. Although Al2O3 was deposited by the atomic-layer-deposition method,
it still has some limitations in the performance. The continuous traps
decrease the HRS value toward the LRS side. After 105 cycles
of endurance, the HRS falls down rapidly. Because of the larger ζ
of the S1 devices, at least a ζ of ∼5 can be achieved
after 106 cycles of endurance.

different RRAM structures. (b) Endurance test shows better cyclability
of the S1 as compared to the S3 RRAM. (c) Uniformity and endurance
dilemma. Thicker Al2O3 shows better endurance,
and thinner Al2O3 shows excellent uniformity
of RS.

nm Al2O3-based bilayer design shows the best
uniformity control
over the thicker devices.

During the SET process of the S3 RRAM, the applied pulse was +3.0
V@500μs and the RESET pulse was −3.0 V—10 ms.
The LRS is very much controlled by the Al2O3 barrier layer thickness.20 In this case,
the LRS for the S3 is lower than that for the S1. In the S3 RRAM,
the CT of the high energetic charge carriers damages the quality of
the film and makes them leakier. The quick degradation of the HRS
can be observed after 104 cycles. Therefore, a clear dilemma
between endurance and switching uniformity is obtained as a function
of the Al2O3 thickness which is illustrated
in Figure 5c. The thicker
Al2O3 RRAM improves the endurance capability,
while switching uniformity is greatly enhanced by the ultrathin Al2O3 interfacial layer. Nevertheless, the endurance
of the S3 devices can be further improved by inserting another thin
Ti layer at the Al2O3/BL interface, the details
of which will be discussed in our next report.

3 Discussion
The basic structure of S1, S2, and S3 RRAMs consists
of similar
materials. The difference is only in the thicknesses of the Al2O3 layer. The band gap φband,
electron affinity χ, and dielectric constant ε of TiO2 are ∼3.2 eV, 4.2 eV, and 80, respectively; and for
Al2O3, they are ∼8.8 eV, 1.25 eV, and
9, respectively. The Gibbs free energies ΔG of TiO2 and Al2O3 are −889.1
and −1582.3 kJ/mol, respectively. The work function (φmetal) values of TiN and IrOx are
4.5 and 5.2 eV, respectively. Figure 6a,d,g shows the schematic structures of the S1, S2,
and S3 devices, respectively. No such peculiarities were found in
the forming behavior of the three types of RRAM devices. The VFORM decreases with decreasing thicknesses of
the Al2O3 layer. In the VCM-type devices, it
is well-expected that the VOs play a major role in controlling
the CNF. Because of the lack of oxygen species in the atomic-layer-deposited
Al2O3, higher energy is necessary to generate
a sufficient number of VO to form the CNF. Therefore, the
initial VFORM is large for the designed
RRAM devices, and the forming process is abrupt rather than gradual.
The ΔG suggests that the generation of VO is much difficult in Al2O3 as compared
to the TiOx layer; hence, the thicker
Al2O3-based S1 RRAM needs higher voltage as
compared to the thinner S3 devices. In addition, the applied voltage
on the BL suggests that the generation of VO is not so
easy, as the BL is not an oxygen-scavenging electrode. Hence, the
generation and migration of VO is completely dependent
on the structure design and can be controlled with the applied bias.
Another aspect of this interfacial band engineering with an ultrathin
Al2O3 layer is that it enhances the controllability
of the formation and rupture process of the CNF. During the RS operation,
the positive bias on the BL attracts the oxygen ions toward the top
and hence the generation of the CNF. It is easier to form VO in the TiOx layer than in the Al2O3 layer. As a result, a CNF based on VO migration forms in the reverse direction to the applied electric
field E, that is, from the WL to the BL. The density
of VO decreases from the TiOx to Al2O3 side. In our previous report, we
show that the metal–insulator–transition process can
be realized in the 8 nm thick TiOx film
under the higher compliance current of ∼500 μA.10 Here, we argue that at the 100 μA current
level, instead of the formation of a Magneli phase filament, a locally
enhanced VO-rich CNF is liable to perform the SET operation.
Below a critical density to form the Magneli phase filament, the VO defect formation is expected over the whole TiOx volume.33,34 Because of the higher
VO density, the connectivity in the TiOx side is more stable than in the Al2O3 side. To RESET the device, a negative voltage was applied to the
BL. With the applied negative bias, the oxygen ions repelled back
to the structure to rescue their positions in the lattice site by
capturing the VO defects. This process leads to the rupture
of the CNF and switches the device from the LRS to the HRS. The rupture
of the CNF is more likely to occur in Al2O3 because
of the less amount of VO defect density. To explore the
conduction mechanism, the experimental data of the devices were fitted
with the theoretical data. The LRS of the S1 RRAM was fitted nicely
with the trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) model at a voltage lower than
3 V, as shown in Figure S5a. Because of
the applied bias, discrete trap sites will be created in the switching
stack, and the charge conduction becomes possible by the trap-to-trap
tunneling process.35,36 The higher voltage range is fitted
to the Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) tunneling model, as shown
in Figure S5b. The tunneling phenomenon
is always assisted by E. High E can
decrease the width of the triangular barrier, and the charge carriers
can tunnel easily. The carrier conduction by F–N tunneling
is a general phenomenon of the flash memory devices.37,38 In the RRAM, it is one of the conduction process reported by several
studies.39,40 Although the tunneling phenomenon starts
at 1 MV/cm, the F–N tunneling probability always dominates
at the higher E > 10 MV/cm.41 The thickness of the modified Al2O3 tunnel
barrier (TBmodified) at higher E can be
approximated by the following equation  

Figure 6 Schematic model for RS in the RRAM with
variable Al2O3 thicknesses. (a–c) With
the applied positive
bias, oxygen ions move toward the BL to SET the device, and RESET
is possible with the negative bias. For the S1 devices, the VO distribution for a fully grown and broken VO CNF
is shown. (d–f) The similar behavior is picturized for S2 devices.
(g–i) Mechanism for S3 devices. The ultrathin Al2O3 layer at the TiOx/BL interface
acts as a tunnel barrier.

Considering E ≈ 10 MV/cm and the
F–N
tunneling at the lowest voltage of 2.7 V (Figure S5b), the approximated TBmodified thickness of Al2O3 in the S1 RRAM is found to be <2.5 nm. Therefore,
as shown in Figure S5c, the changes from
high E to low E change the conduction
mechanism from F–N tunneling to TAT.

When the voltage
is applied to the BL, the VO-defect
sites are generated and the charge carriers are transported through
the traps by the trap-to-trap tunneling process. Incomplete filament
formation is very much related to the tunneling model. In the TiOx/Al2O3 structure, it
is likely that there are more VO-defect sites in TiOx rather than in Al2O3. Therefore, during RESET, the cell switching from the LRS to the
HRS, a few oxygen ions can break the CNF in the Al2O3 side rather than in the TiOx side.
The cycle-to-cycle HRS to LRS switching indicates multiple breaks
in the CNF. The breaking points and numbers are varied with cycles.
Hence, the cycle-to-cycle rupturing processes of the CNF are nonuniform,
but it is more likely to happen in the Al2O3 layer only. The situation is schematically illustrated in Figure 6b. The broken parts
of the CNF provide an acting potential barrier for the carrier transmission
process. On the basis of the evolution of the CNF, the reliability
of the RRAM devices can be changed.42 In
our previous study, we have shown that tunnel resistance is very much
related to the gap length (δ).43 Considering
three resistance changes of Figure 3a, the zoom-in view of the broken VO-CNF
with three tunnel gaps (δ1 ≠ δ2 ≠ δ3)
is illustrated in Figure 6c. Before approaching any gap, the current continuously increases
with voltage, indicating a CT effect. The gap region is dominated
by the DT process. For the 5 nm thick Al2O3 layer
in the S2 RRAM structure, the probability of broken places is less
than in the S1 structure. On the basis of the experimental data, the
schematic illustration of the CNF in the S2 RRAM with one broken place
is shown in Figure 6e. The experimental R–V nature
of the inset of Figure 3c is illustrated in Figure 6f. The conduction follows the fashion similar to the S1 RRAM,
that is, CT followed by DT. However, DT in the S2 devices is less
than in the S1 devices.

When it comes to the S3 RRAM, no such
DT was observed. In this
case, the ultrathin 2 nm Al2O3 layer acts as
the tunnel barrier layer, as shown in Figure 6g. This can enhance the nonlinearity in the
TiOx/Al2O3 RRAM.8 The LRS conduction of the devices is fitted perfectly
with the F–N tunneling model, as shown in Figure S5b. Because of the higher E, the
electrons are able to tunnel through the triangular potential barrier
of Al2O3 and hence conduction. Unlike the 8
nm thick S1 devices, the F–N tunneling mechanism is dominated
by a comparatively lower voltage because of the ultrathin Al2O3 layer in S3 devices, which is another evidence of the
scaling of the interfacial layer thicknesses in TiOx/Al2O3-based RRAM devices. Figure 6h,i shows SET and RESET processes,
respectively. In this process, there is no probability of the broken
CNF in the Al2O3 layer. The suppression of the
oxygen-scavenging effect mainly follows the thicknesses of the Al2O3 layer. The thicker the Al2O3, the larger the asymmetry in VO-defect density, creating
more fluctuation in the RS process. Hence, the variability is greatly
affected with the thickness scaling of the Al2O3 layer.

Meanwhile, the S1 RRAM shows higher endurance cycles
than the S3
RRAM, as indicated in Figure 5c. However, HRS degradation dominates in both cases. The results
suggest that the number of trap sites increases with the number of
cycles, which degrades the quality of the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer stack with increasing
cycles. The thicker film of the S1 devices has a better sufferance
and trapping ability as compared to the S3 devices and hence the better
endurance. However, the endurance of the S3 RRAM can be improved further
by inserting a thin Ti layer in the Al2O3/BL
interface, which will be discussed in our next report.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the variability
improvement in
RS operation and cyclability in the TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer RRAM devices by interfacial
band engineering with an ultrathin ∼2 nm Al2O3 dielectric material, over the thick ∼8 nm Al2O3. The thicker film acts as a part of the RS switching
layer, but the thinner film behaves as a tunnel barrier layer. At
low field, the LRS conduction for the thick Al2O3 RRAM follows the TAT conduction and that for the tunnel barrier
Al2O3 RRAM follows the F–N tunneling
conduction model. The improvement has been achieved in the variation
control in device forming, SET voltage distribution, HRS, LRS, and
resistance ratio, with the ultrathin Al2O3-based
TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer
RRAM devices.

5 Experimental Section
The 0.24 μm2 RRAM devices consist of the TiN/TiOx/Al2O3/IrOx structure. The TiN layer is the WL and IrOx is the BL. The TiOx/Al2O3 bilayer is placed at each junction point of
the WL and the BL. The TiOx layer with
a thickness of 8 nm grew on the top of the WL with an oxidation plasma
treatment. In between TiOx and the BL,
the Al2O3 layer grew by the atomic-layer-deposition
technique with a thickness variation from 8 nm to a scaled one to
2 nm. The process steps are as follows: 200 sccm TMA@100ms →
N2 purge@5s → 200 sccm TMA@100ms → N2 purge@5s → 150 sccm H2O@100ms →
N2 purge@5s → 150 sccm H2O@100ms →
N2 purge@5s. In total, 24 cycles, 60 cycles, and 96 cycles
have done a 2, 5, and 8 nm thick Al2O3 layers.
During the electrical measurements, all voltages applied on BLs and
WLs were kept grounded.
