We address the electronically induced
anisotropy field acting on
a spin moment in a vibrating magnetic molecule located in the junction
between ferromagnetic metals. Under weak coupling between the electrons
and molecular vibrations, the nature of the anisotropy can be changed
from favoring a high spin (easy-axis) magnetic moment to a low spin
(easy plane) by applying a temperature difference or a voltage bias
across the junction. For unequal spin polarizations in ferromagnetic
metals, it is shown that the character of the anisotropy is essentially
determined by the properties of the weaker ferromagnet. By increasing
the temperature in this metal or introducing a voltage bias, its influence
can be suppressed such that the dominant contribution to the anisotropy
is interchanged to the stronger ferromagnet. With increasing coupling
strength between the molecular vibrations and the electrons, the nature
of the anisotropy is locked into favoring easy-plane magnetism.

Introduction
Magnetic interactions and anisotropies
are fundamentally important
for magnetic ordering and magnetic properties of both materials1,2 and molecular complexes.3−7 Recent demonstrations of stabilized ordered magnetic configurations
in clusters of magnetic adatoms deposited on metallic surface,3 low-frequency switching between degenerate ground
states,8 and magnetic remanence of single
atoms9 open for atomic and molecular scale
magnetism. Reports of electrical control of the amplitude of the magnetic
anisotropy10,11 show versatile functionality.
Moreover, the sign of the anisotropy is fundamentally important for
whether the spin assumes a high (easy-axis) or a low (easy-plane)
spin ground state. The general mechanisms that control the sign of
the anisotropy remain, nonetheless, an open question.12−19

Crucial for the demonstrations, for example, in refs,3,8−11 is that the effective anisotropy field acting on the local magnetic
moments is sufficiently strong to suppress rapid fluctuations between
degenerate and nearly degenerate magnetic configurations. However,
experiments of this kind are often performed at low temperatures because
the energy scale of the pertinent magnetic anisotropies is on the
order of sub-millielectronvolt and, thus, are not effective at high
temperatures.4,20,21

Another aspect of low-temperature measurements is that ionic
displacements
and vibrations can be subdued, thus quenching undesired configurational
fluctuations which may transfer angular momentum into the spin degrees
of freedom. It is well-known, however, that molecular vibrations may
have a severe influence on the electronic and magnetic properties
of molecular structures.21−25 The resulting modifications of the internal properties are then
conveyed over to, for example, the transport properties, which has
been shown both experimentally4,21,26,27 and theoretically.28−34

Thus far, issues related to ionic displacements and vibrations
have been studied separately from questions concerning magnetically
relevant quantities in molecular structures.30,35 At a phenomenological level, however, there have been several studies
in which effective coupling rates between vibrational and spin degrees
of freedom have been employed to account for thermal fluctuations
through molecular vibrations (see, e.g., refs21,33,36,37). On the
other hand, the coupling rates have been inserted by hand in an ad
hoc fashion and do not relate to the real microscopic nature of the
system. In this article, we consider the magnetic anisotropy acting
on a local magnetic moment, embedded in a molecular environment, which
is induced by the molecular electronic structure. In order to go beyond
the simple electronic picture of the anisotropy, we include a weak
coupling between electrons and molecular vibrations. We make contact
with a possible experimental setup by considering the molecular compound
to be inserted in the junction between ferromagnetic metallic electrodes,
as studied, for example, in ref (21). It is important to notice that the anisotropy
crucially depends not only on the molecular electronic and magnetic
structure near the chemical potential in the setup but also on the
occupied electronic density. The interplay between these components
and of the spin polarizations in the ferromagnets determines the sign
of the anisotropy. We, furthermore, find that the electronically induced
magnetic anisotropy strongly, in addition to the spin polarizations
of the leads, depends on the temperature difference and voltage bias
across the junction. In particular, the sign of the anisotropy field
can be deliberately switched, in junctions with different spin polarizations
in the two ferromagnets, by increasing the temperature in the ferromagnet
with weaker spin polarization. Furthermore, when inferring nonequilibrium
conditions by applying a voltage bias across the junction, the polarity
of the voltage determines the sign of the anisotropy. Of major importance
is that our results remain robust under the presence of molecular
vibrations weakly coupled to the electrons. This may not be expected
because the molecular vibrations tend to broaden the distribution
of the electronic density. However, because the contribution associated
with the electronic density at the chemical potential can be tuned
by external gating, it is feasible to vary both the sign and the amplitude
by external forces. For sufficiently strong electron–vibron
coupling, the sign of the anisotropy is locked into favoring easy-plane
ground state only.

Here, we build on the previous predictions
made in refs38,40 for dimers
of magnetic molecules in which the effective spin–spin interactions
are mediated by the properties of the delocalized electrons, especially
addressing the magnetic self-interactions or magnetic anisotropy acting
on the localized spin moment. Our setup pertains to, for instance,
M-phthalocyanine (MPc), M-porphyrins, where M denotes a transition-metal
atom,11,41−43 for example, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu, and also bis(phthalocyaninato)R (TPc2),44,45 where R denotes a rare earth element, for
example, Tb. Such molecules can be investigated in, for example, mechanically
controlled break junctions,45,46 carbon nanotube assemblies,44 and scanning tunneling microscope.11,42 Vibrational modes ranging from 0.1 to 100 meV have been observed
for various types of magnetic molecular compounds.21,26

Results and Discussion
Model
We consider the electronically
mediated magnetic
anisotropy in a single magnetic molecule embedded in the junction
between ferromagnetic or normal metallic leads (see Figure 1 for a sketch of the setup).
The molecule comprises a ligand structure, which provides the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) close to the Fermi level of the system as a whole, which is
connected to the leads via tunneling. Henceforth, we shall refer to
the HOMO/LUMO level as the localized level. Located in the molecular
structure is also a spin moment which interacts via local exchange
(Kondo coupling) with the localized level. Molecular vibrations are,
moreover, coupled to the localized level. All in all, the structure
is modeled using the Hamiltonian 1  Here,
the energies of the metallic leads are
given by , where χ denotes the left (L) and
right (R) leads, in which electrons are created (annihilated) by the
operator ckσ†(ckσ) at the energy εkσ with momentum k and spin σ = ↑,↓.
For convenience, we denote electrons in the left (right) lead with
the momentum k = p (k = q). Tunneling between the leads and the localized level is
described in terms of , where tkσ defines
the spin-dependent tunneling rate, whereas dσ denotes the electron annihilation in
the localized level. The molecular complex is, finally, described
through the Hamiltonian 2  where
ε0 denotes the spin-independent
energy of the localized level, U is the local Coulomb
repulsion, and nσ = dσ†dσ. The electron spin s = ∑σσ′dσ†σσσ′dσ′/2 in the localized level interacts with
the local spin with rate v, where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The local vibrational mode is described
by the bosonic operators b† and b and energy ω0 and is coupled to electrons
in the localized level with rate λ.

Figure 1 Sketch of the vibrating
magnetic molecule mounted in the junction
between ferromagnetic leads with different temperatures. Electrons
in the molecules, subject to the Coulomb repulsion U, are coupled to the vibrations with rate λ, the localized
spin moment with rate v, and the electrodes with
tunneling rates tχ, χ = L,R.
The applied voltage V across the junction shifts
the (electro)chemical potentials μχ of the
leads from the equilibrium chemical potential μ.

The coupling between the electronic and vibrational
degrees of
freedom is considered to be weak such that the local electronic structure
is only weakly modified by the vibrations. Although this assumption
limits the applicability of our conclusions, it nevertheless provides
qualitative information about some expected influences from the vibrations
on the local magnetic moment. For stronger couplings and more general
conclusions, one would have to employ self-consistent methods29,47 or coupled spin and lattice dynamics.48 However, under the assumption of weak coupling, we can employ the
Lang–Firsov transformation,49 which
leads to a diagonal formulation of  with respect to the effective fermionic
and bosonic degrees of freedom.

The Lang–Firsov transformation
is performed through the
canonical transformation , with the generating functional . The transformation leads to that
the localized
energy levels are shifted into ε̃0 = ε0 – λ2/ω0, while the
renormalized charging energy Ũ = U – 2λ2/ω0. The Hamiltonian
for the molecular structure is, accordingly, reduced to 3  

The tunneling rates in  are changed into tkσX, where X = exp{(λ/ω0)(b – b†)}. However, considering only weakly
coupled electrons and vibrations,29,30,50 the factor X ≈ 1 such that
we can replace the tunneling rates by tkσ. Hence, the remaining three contributions in
the Hamiltonian are considered to be unaffected by the transformation.
We also assume that the vibrations are considered to instantaneously
equilibrate,51−53 which is justified because we are merely interested
in how the magnetic anisotropy modifies with the presence of vibrations.
The back action of both the spin and the electrons on the vibrational
degrees of freedom is a topic which is beyond the present study.

Green Function Approach
We calculate physical quantities,
such as the electronically induced magnetic anisotropy acting on the
local spin moment and the density of electron states of the localized
level, in terms of the single electron Green function G(t,t′) = {(−i)⟨Tdσ(t)dσ′†(t′)⟩}σσ′, which is a 2 × 2-matrix in the
spin 1/2 space. For later purposes, we note that the Green function
can be decomposed into its charge and magnetic components G0 and G1, respectively,
according to G = G0σ0 + G1·σ, where
σ0 is the identity matrix. Hence, the nonequilibrium
density of electron states and the corresponding spin polarization
are obtained from 4a   4b  respectively.

Given that the leads are
aligned in either parallel or antiparallel to one another, we can
introduce a global spin-quantization axis, say, ẑ, along which all magnetic properties are given. It is, thus, justified
to assume that G1 = Gzẑ such that we can define G0(z) = ∑σσσ0(z)Gσ/2, where Gσ is the spin-projected Green function. Finally, we notice
that because we are interested in nonequilibrium properties, we calculate
all quantities in terms of the lesser and greater propagators G</>. For simplicity, however, and because
we
view the leads as source and drain reservoirs for electrons, the lesser/greater
Green functions will be calculated using the relation G</> = Gr∑</>Ga, where Gr/a is
the retarded/advanced forms of the Green function, whereas ∑</> is the lesser/greater self-energy. Here, we
shall
merely include the couplings Γχ to the reservoirs in this self-energy such that we can write ∑</>(ω) = (±i)∑χfχ(±ω)Γχ, where fχ(ω) = f(ω – μχ) is the Fermi distribution function for the electrons in the lead
χ with (electro)chemical potential μχ. The spin-resolved coupling parameters Γσχ = 2π∑k∈χ|tkσ|2δ(ω – εkσ) are parameterized such that Γσχ =
Γ(1 + σσσzpχ)/4, −1 ≤ pχ ≤
1, where Γ = ∑χσΓσχ, Γχ = ∑σΓσχ, and Γσ = ∑χΓσχ.

From the Lang–Firsov
transformation, it also follows that
the single electron Green function 5  where the propagators G̃σσ′(t,t′) = (−i)⟨Tσd̃(t)d̃σ′†(t′)⟩ and ⟨X(t)X†(t′)⟩ are defined in the model  such
that  and . The renormalization factor caused
by the
coupling between the electrons and the vibrations is calculated through
⟨X(t)X†(t′)⟩ = exp{−Φ(τ)},
where54 (τ = t – t′) 6  Here, nB = (exp{βω0} – 1)−1 is the Bose–Einstein
distribution with the inverse temperature β = 1/kBT in terms of the Boltzmann constant kB. Furthermore, we calculate the electronic
propagator G̃ in the mean-field approximation,
where the retarded components are given by G̃σσ′r = δσσ′G̃σr, where 7  and ⟨nσ⟩ = (−i)∫G̃σ<(ω)dω/2π.
This construction of the Green function requires a self-consistent
treatment, except for effectively noninteracting conditions, Ũ = 0. Here, we restrict our investigation to this
limit, in which the expression in eq 7 simplifies to 8  It is a straightforward calculation to obtain 9  where In(z) is the nth modified Bessel
function and .

We infer the
limitations of the present approximations50 on λ, ω0, and Γ,
given by λ/ω0 < 1 < (Γ/2ω0) exp{−(λ/ω0)2},
ω0 < |ε0 – λ2/ω0|, and 2λ2/ω0 < Γ. In order to fulfill these restrictions, we
require that λ/Γ ≤ 1/6 and 1/5 < ω0/Γ < 6/5.

We comment that the only source of
spin imbalance in the localized
level is generated by the spin-dependent coupling parameters Γσχ to
the left and right leads. While it is possible to imagine an induced
Zeeman split from the ferromagnetic leads, by assuming that the tunnel
junction is formed by, for example, a quantum point contact between
the leads, we can omit stray and fringing fields that otherwise may
generate this splitting.

Anisotropy Parameter
The influence
of the electronic
motion on the localized spin moment has been considered previously
in studies of, for example, the spin and transport dynamics in single
magnetic molecules55,56 and the interplay between magnetic
interactions, configurations, and transport in dimers of magnetic
molecules,38−40 as well as in general materials structures.48 Following the prescription formulated in these
publications, we here write the electronically induced magnetic anisotropy
acting on the localized spin moment according to38Izz = iv2∫–∞t⟨[sz(t),sz(t′)]⟩
exp{iω(t – t′)}
dt′. However, for the general interacting
model in the present setup, this propagator cannot be decoupled to
the form given in ref (38) but has to be treated with an additional care. Nevertheless, because
we restrict ourselves to effective noninteracting conditions, Ũ = 0, the expression 10  remains valid. While the anisotropy is generally
formulated as a second-rank tensor, it is here reduced to the zz-component only because all magnetic properties are aligned
with the global ẑ-direction. In the framework
of an effective model for the localized spin, where the surrounding
environment is parameterized into local interactions and anisotropies,48 we write the spin Hamiltonian as 11  where D and E are the uniaxial and transverse anisotropy
parameters, respectively.
In the present setup, where the spin direction is given along ẑ, the transverse anisotropy E = 0,
whereas the uniaxial anisotropy D ≡ Izz.

Within the scheme
presented above, we can derive a simplified expression for the anisotropy
parameter D in terms of the retarded Green function
for the localized level and the coupling parameters to the leads.
After some straightforward algebra, we obtain 12  Here, in the absence of both the coupling
between the electrons and vibrations (λ = 0) and the Coulomb
interaction (U = 0), the current approximations allow
for making the identification Γσ|Gσr(ω)|2/2 = −Im Gσr(ω). Thence, using the Kramers–Krönig
relations, it is straightforward to see that the bare anisotropy parameter D0 can be written
according to 13  where we have introduced the components 14a   14b  From this expression, it can be understood
that the anisotropy crucially depends on the spin imbalance (ln|G↑r| – ln|G↓r|) in the molecular electronic structure.
The specific details of the electronic structure near the chemical
potentials μχ of the leads are provided through
the contribution D0∼ because it involves the derivative
−∂fχ(ω)/∂ω.
The strength as well as the sign of the anisotropy energy is determined
by the interplay between the contributions D0∼ and D0T, manifest through their opposite signs. The former component is
large whenever there is a simultaneous large local electron density
and large local spin imbalance at the chemical potentials μχ. This follows from the presence of the derivatives
of the Fermi function, which pick out the value of the spin-resolved
density of electron states, −Im Gσr, at these
energies. The amplitude of the latter component (D0T) depends,
in addition to the magnitude of the spin imbalance, on the electronic
occupation. Trivially, this component vanishes identically when the
electronic density is completely empty, that is, in the limit μχ → −∞, for all χ. In the
opposite limit, however, there may be a finite value caused by, for
example, distinct occupation numbers of the molecular spin states.
The amplitude of the contribution D0T is, nevertheless, maximal when
the localized level is resonant with the chemical potentials. Henceforth,
we shall refer to D0∼ as Fermi surface effect and D0T as the volume or Fermi sea effect—in correspondence to a
terminology often employed in condensed matter physics. We thereby
allude to their intrinsic dependences on the electronic structure
at the chemical potentials and on the occupied electron density.

Concerning the realistic values of the parameters pertaining to
the molecular compounds for this modeling, the local (Kondo) exchange
coupling may vary in the range v ≈ 0.5–20
meV,57,58 molecular vibrations ω0 ≈ 0.1–100 meV.21,26 The on-site Coulomb
repulsion is often not known but can be, to a good approximation,
often taken as small, or negligible, for the s- and p-orbitals that
constitute the localized level. Therefore, we consider the case with
vanishing bare Coulomb repulsion in the absence of coupling between
the vibrations and the electrons and vanishing effective Coulomb repulsion
whenever this coupling is finite.

Zero Voltage Bias
The anisotropy has a nontrivial dependence
on the spin polarization both in the leads and locally in the molecular
structure as well as on the external conditions which may, or may
not, plunge the system into nonequilibrium. However, in a simple setup
with a spin-degenerate localized level, where the only spin dependence
is provided from the spin-dependent coupling parameters Γσχ, the
anisotropy is expected to be positive and large near resonance (ε0 – μχ ≈ 0) while it is
negative and small away from resonance. This behavior is verified
in Figure 2a, where
we plot D0 as function of the localized
level ε0 with respect to the equilibrium chemical
potential μ = 0 (μχ = μ). In the
simulations, we assumed pL = 0.6 and pR ∈ {0.6, 0.3, 0, −0.3}, TL/R = 3 K. The behavior of the anisotropy, varying
between negative and positive, opens for the possibility to switch
the localized spin moment between high and low spin configurations,
where a positive (negative) anisotropy leads to a low (high) spin
ground state.

Figure 2 Anisotropy as a function of the localized energy level
ε0 for different spin polarizations pR = 0.6, 0.3, 0, −0.3 at constant pL = 0.6 and different temperatures in the right lead:
(a) TR = 3 K, (b) TR =
8 K, and (c) TR = 13 K, at constant temperature TL = 3 K in the left, and (d) TL = 13 K and TR = 3 K. Other
parameters are Γ = 4 meV, λ = 0, U =
0, and μχ = 0.

Upon increasing the temperature in the right lead, the influence
of the thermal broadening becomes asymmetric, which has a dramatic
influence on the resulting anisotropy. In Figure 2b,c, we plot the corresponding D0 for two finite temperature differences (5 and 10 K,
respectively) at different spin polarizations pR. The most notable feature is that the sign of D0 changes in all setups with asymmetric spin polarizations
(pL ≠ pR) when the temperature difference increases.

We analyze this
property by resolving the Fermi surface and Fermi
sea effects into left and right components according to D0∼/T = D0L∼/T + D0R∼/T, which is a natural partitioning
given the summation over the left and right electrodes in eq 14. In Figure 3a, the total anisotropy D0 (black) is plotted along with its components (see the figure for
details), for spin polarizations pL =
2pR = 0.6 and vanishing temperature difference
between the leads. It is clear from the plots that the left and right
contributions are strongly asymmetric and that the right components
dominate the total anisotropy, in this case. Here, D0R∼ >
0 and D0RT < 0 near resonance, and because the amplitude
of the former is the larger one, the result is D0 > 0. This condition remains true under an increase of
the
temperature TL (see Figure 3b) because the increased thermal broadening
of the components D0L∼ > 0 and D0LT < 0 induced
from the left lead tends to equalize the sizes of their amplitudes
such that D0L∼ + D0LT ≈ 0. However, by increasing
the temperature TR, on the other hand,
likewise, the increased thermal broadening tends to equalize the amplitudes
of D0R∼ > 0 and D0RT < 0 instead such that the
overall
effect from the right lead vanishes (see Figure 3c). Hence, the properties induced from the
left lead begin to dominate, and in the setup depicted in Figure 3, the negative amplitude D0L∼ is larger than the positive amplitude of D0LT, which leads
to an overall negative anisotropy.

and right Fermi surface
(D0L∼—cyan and D0R∼—blue) and Fermi
sea (D0LT—orange and D0RT—magenta) components as
a function of the localized energy level ε0 for the
spin polarizations pL = 2pR = 0.6 at the temperatures (a) TL = TR = 1 K, (b) TL = 10TR = 10 K, and (c) TL = TR/10 = 1 K.
Other parameters are as in Figure 2.

Furthermore, consider
the simplified expression of the surface
component to the anisotropy in eq 14a at λ = 0, U = 0, and let the
temperature Tχ → 0 such that
the energy derivative of the Fermi function can be replaced by the
Dirac delta function δ(ω – μχ). Then, the value of the integrand is picked out at the chemical
potential μχ, which enables an analysis of
the voltage-dependent sign of the anisotropy at μχ. In fact, it is straightforward to show that this contribution is
positive whenever the spin polarization pχ satisfies the condition 15  Using this relation gives
a tool to design
and engineer the structure in terms of the ferromagnetic leads such
that the nature or sign of the anisotropy can be predicted.

The conclusion regarding the anisotropy at zero voltage bias is,
hence, that its sign can be switched under the application of a thermal
difference across the molecular junction provided that the spin polarizations
in the leads are unequal. This feature is strongly enhanced the stronger
the asymmetry of the spin polarizations of the leads is along with
a large temperature difference between the leads. The properties
of the anisotropy are dominated by the properties of the lead with
the lowest temperature. If both temperatures are equal or nearly equal,
the lead with the weaker spin polarization has the strongest influence.
In the asymmetric setup, the stronger spin polarization tends to generate
a negative anisotropy near resonance, whereas the weaker generates
a positive. Because the latter typically has the larger amplitude,
the overall anisotropy becomes positive. By increasing the temperature
in the lead with weaker (stronger) spin polarization, the effect of
the lead with the stronger (weaker) becomes increasingly important.

A compelling issue regarding the sign changes of the anisotropy
is whether these features remain under the influence of molecular
vibrations. In particular, one concern might be that the sign change
at resonance is suppressed by the broadening of the electron density
caused when vibrational fluctuations modify the electronic structure.
However, by investigating the anisotropy in the presence of the molecular
vibrations (λ > 0), we find that most of the features that
were
obtained in the absence of the vibrations are quite robust in the
sense that these are retained also when the coupling to the vibrations
is finite. In Figure 4, we plot the anisotropy for the spin polarizations and temperature
differences used in Figure 2. The most noticeable difference compared to the case without
molecular vibrations is the general decrease in amplitude near resonance.
Associated with this decrease is also a slight broadening of the anisotropy
around resonance. We attribute these features to the emergence of
several resonances in the electronic density caused by the coupling
between the electrons and the vibrations, which is visualized in Figure 5. In this figure,
we have plotted the spin-resolved densities of electron states for
varying coupling λ and temperature difference across the junction.
In particular, the emergence of vibrational side resonances with increasing
λ, and the temperature difference is clearly seen in the spin
channel corresponding to smaller couplings to the leads. The energy
shift of the resonant conditions, both in the anisotropy and the densities
of electron states, seen for finite λ, is due to the energy
renormalization ε̃σ = εσ – λ2/ω0 invoked by the
Lang–Firsov transformation.

8 K, (c) TR = 13, and (d) TR = 23 K, at constant temperature TL = 3 K in the left, ω0 = 0.8 meV, λ

K, at constant temperature TL = 3 K in

These observations for the anisotropy at zero voltage bias
and
finite temperature difference solidify our previous conclusion in
that the possibility to switch the anisotropy between negative and
positive values near resonance remains essentially unaffected by the
presence of molecular vibrations. We notice, nonetheless, that while
the lowered amplitude of the anisotropy decreases the effective temperature
range in which this anisotropy has a viable effect on the local spin
moment, its increased broadening around resonance makes it less susceptible
to fluctuations in the molecular environment. It is also important
to notice that the coupling to vibrations has a tendency to lock the
sign of the anisotropy, which is striking in the case of equal spin
polarizations in the leads. We discuss this effect in more detail
below.

Finite Voltage Bias
At zero bias, the amplitude and
sign of the anisotropy field results from a nontrivial interplay between
the Fermi surface and volume effects, on the one hand, and the relation
between the spin polarizations in the two leads, on the other. Under
finite temperature differences, the latter led to a ceased
net contribution to the anisotropy from the lead with higher temperatures.
Under finite bias voltages, the situation is slightly analogous, in
the sense that the anisotropy is dominated by the properties, for
example, spin polarization and temperature, of the lead that is resonant
with the molecular level, whereas the portion emerging from the other
lead is negligible. The result of this behavior is that the anisotropy
can become positive for one voltage bias polarity and negative for
the opposite, which may particularly occur under asymmetric spin polarizations
in the leads. This prediction is manifest in Figure 6, where the anisotropy is shown as a function
of the molecular level position for different couplings λ and
voltage biases (see the figure caption for details).

Figure 6 Anisotropy as a function
of the localized energy level ε0 for the spin polarizations pL = 2pR = 0.6, temperatures TL = TR = 10 K, and
different
λ/Γ = 0, 1/12, 1/8, 1/6 for voltage biases (a) Vsd = 0.1 mV, (b) Vsd = 1.1 mV, and (c) Vsd = 10 mV and (d)
for varying Vsd and λ = 1/10. Other
parameters are as in Figure 4.

Low voltage biases only slightly
alter the shape and nature of
the anisotropy from its zero voltage bias characteristics (see Figure 6a), which would be
expected from a linear response consideration. At higher voltage biases,
however, the individual properties of the ferromagnetic leads become
legible (see Figure 6b,c) in the signatures of the anisotropy. This behavior underscores
that it is the electronic density and spin polarization, as well as
their corresponding occupations, near the chemical potential that
determine the nature of the anisotropy. In the situations displayed
in Figure 6, the left
lead has the stronger spin polarization, |pL| > |pR|, and following the results
from
zero voltage bias, one would expect that the influence from this lead
is negative and weaker than the one from the right. A positive voltage
bias shifts the left (right) chemical potential μL (μR) to a higher (lower) energy by eV/2 > 0
(−eV/2
< 0), which leads to different resonant conditions between the
molecular level ε0 and the left and right chemical
potentials. As ε0 approaches μL (μR), only the spin polarization in the left (right) lead matters
to the resulting anisotropy, which, in the present case, becomes negative
(positive). The same, but opposite, characteristics are obtained for
negative polarity of the voltage bias, which can be seen in Figure 6d, which shows the
anisotropy as a function of the molecular level energy and voltage
bias. Finally, increasing the strength of the coupling λ tends
to lock the sign of the anisotropy to favor the low spin ground state,
analogous to the situation at zero voltage bias. The vibrationally
induced broadening of the density of electron states as well as lowering
its amplitude decreases the electron occupation, which quenches the
volume contribution and opens for the surface contribution to become
dominant. Hence, the net anisotropy assumes a positive sign for a
wide range of voltage biases.

Conclusions
We
have studied the electronically induced magnetic anisotropy
acting on a localized moment embedded in a molecular structure and
placed in the junction between ferromagnetic leads. The spin polarization
of the leads allows for a uniaxial anisotropy that can result in either
a high (easy axis) or low (easy-plane) spin ground state, depending
on the sign of the anisotropy. At zero voltage bias and for unequal
spin polarizations in the leads, we notice that the lead with the
weaker spin polarization tends to have the stronger influence on the
resulting sign of the anisotropy. By the influence of a temperature
difference across the junction, the anisotropy can, however, change
its sign provided that it is the temperature of the lead with lower
spin polarization that is increased. Under finite voltage bias and
unequal spin polarizations, the sign of the anisotropy changes upon
reversal of the polarity of the voltage bias. Our results are shown
to be robust under the influence of molecular vibrations weakly coupled
to the electrons. An increasing coupling strength between the electrons
and the molecular vibrations tends to lock the sign of the anisotropy
to become positive and hence favors a low spin (easy-plane) ground
state configuration.
