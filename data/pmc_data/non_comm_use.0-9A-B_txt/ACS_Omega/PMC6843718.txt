An approach to tailor the morphology
and sensing characteristics
of CuO nanoplatelets for selective detection of NO2 gas
is of great significance and an important step toward achieving the
challenge of improving air quality and in assuring the safety of mining
operations. As a result, in this study, we report on the NO2 room temperature gas-sensing characteristics of CuO nanoplatelets
and the underlying mechanism toward the gas-sensing performance by
altering the synthesis reaction base and time. High sensitivity of
∼40 ppm–1 to NO2 gas at room temperature
has been realized for gas sensors fabricated from CuO nanoplatelets,
using NaOH as base for reaction times of 45 and 60 min, respectively
at 75 °C. In both cases, the crystallite size, surface area,
and hole concentration of the respective materials influenced the
selectivity and sensitivity of the NO2 gas sensors. The
mechanism underpinning the superior NO2 gas sensing are
thoroughly discussed in terms of the crystallite size, hole concentration,
and surface area as active sites for gas adsorption.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
development and implementation of sustainable gas detection
systems, that can potentially safeguard the environment, have received
a great deal of attention. Gases such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide
(CO), ammonia (NH3), hydrogen (H2), and sulphur
dioxide (SO2) are detrimental to health, an explosion hazard
and can even be lethal. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of
the most common air pollutants from automotive and combustion emissions.1 It is toxic and harmful to human health in lower
concentrations causing serious diseases such as chronic bronchitis,
emphysema, and respiratory irritation.1b,1c Recently,
Greenpeace Africa has announced that the largest NO2 hotspot,
across the six continents, is currently located in South Africa. This
has reportedly led to numerous deaths and restricted workdays resulting
in a total loss greater than US$2.3 billion per year.2 Therefore, it is crucial to develop high-performance sensors
to detect NO2 gas swiftly and reliably.

For over
five decades solid-state metal oxide (MOX)-based gas sensors
have been developed and applied because they are small, highly sensitive
(detection of different target gases in the ppm to ppb range), and
cost-effective compared to classical instrumental analysis.3 The sensing performance of MOX-based gas sensors
strongly depends on the electrical conduction, which is affected by
the number of charge carriers and active sites available on the surface,
of the sensing material.4 Large specific
surface area and point defects, which promotes adsorption and desorption
of oxygen ions and gas atoms from the sensor materials, as well as
morphology and crystallographic structures, are factors reported to
have an influence on the gas-sensing performance.5 Most of the gas sensor research thus far was directed toward
using n-type MOX semiconductors, such as CeO2, SnO2, WO3, or ZnO for gas sensors.6 More recently, the focus has shifted to p-type semiconducting
and MOX nanocomposite gas sensors.7 Compared
to n-type materials, some p-type gas-sensitive materials have been
reported to have significant surface reactivity to oxidizing and reducing
gases at lower operating temperatures, which might lead to future
advances in low energy consumption gas-sensing devices.7a,7b,8 Cupric oxide (CuO) has attracted
a great deal of attention over the last decade because of its wide
range of potential applications,9 including
gas sensors.7f,10 Gas sensors based on CuO nanostructures
have exhibited superior sensing performances.7f,10f,10g Enhanced sensor response to
NH3, H2S, and NO2 gases have previously
been reported for CuO nanostructures below an operating temperature
of 200 °C, while sensitivity to volatile organic compound (VOC’s)
was found above 200 °C.10e,11

Previously, we
showed that the sensing performance of CuO nanomaterials
is dependent on the preparation conditions, that is, reaction temperature
and copper ion intermediate. By adjusting these conditions, the material
properties including point defects and surface area were advertently
changed, resulting in the enhanced sensitivity to NO2 gas
at room temperature.7f In this paper, we
report on the effect of prolonged reaction times on the subsequent
gas-sensing performance of the CuO nanoplatelets. A thorough study
on the gas-sensing performance of the nanoplatelet CuO-based gas sensors
to various gases, including NH3, CO, CH4, NO2, H2S, and isopropanol (IPA), at room temperature
is investigated. We demonstrate the underlying mechanism toward the
enhancement of gas-sensing response by modifying the synthesis reaction
base and time.

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Characterization of the CuO Gas-Sensing Material
CuO
nanoplatelets were prepared by the sonochemical method, and
the purified CuO products were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM). As confirmed by the XRD patterns and
indexed according to the JCPDS card no. 48-1548, all as-prepared CuO
products obtained after various reaction times (i.e., 45 and 60 min)
at 55 and 75 °C in the presence of various bases (C-NH4OH-45 and C-NH4OH-60 prepared from NH4OH at a reaction temperature of 55 °C; E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60, and E-Urea-45 and E-Urea-60 prepared, at a reaction temperature of 75 °C,
from NaOH and urea, respectively) were pure monoclinic-phase, as seen
in Figure 1a–c.
No characteristic peaks from the precursors and intermediates, such
as Cu2O or Cu(OH)2, was been observed, suggesting
that the Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Cu2(OH)2CO3 precursors have been completely
transformed into CuO. The average crystallite size of the synthesized
CuO nanoplatelets was calculated using the Debye–Scherrer formula12 and the lattice strain (ε), as shown in
the Supporting Information, Table S1. The
characteristic bands of CuO were observed in Raman spectra at ∼280,
330, and 610 cm–1, corresponding to the standard
Ag (297 cm–1) and two Bg (345
and 632 cm–1) modes, respectively, further confirming
the phase purity of the synthesized CuO nanoplatelets (see Figure
S1a–c in the Supporting Information).

The growth mechanism
of CuO nanoplatelet products can be explained
on the basis of the chemical reactions and nucleation. As previously
reported, three synthetic routes were followed to obtain the desired
CuO products.7f In all three cases, the
copper salt precursor, (Cu(NO3)2·3H2O), was dissolved in distilled water to form an octahedral
copper intermediate complex, [Cu(H2O)6]2+. The first and the most simple synthetic route included
the addition of a high concentration of NaOH solution to the reaction
mixture containing [Cu(H2O)6]2+ producing
square-planar complex [Cu(OH)4]2– ions
(ratio of ∼2.5:1, OH– to Cu2+),
which is easily transformed to CuO nuclei. During the second and third
synthetic routes, the [Cu(H2O)6]2+ ion complex was transformed to [Cu(NH3)4(H2O)2]2+ with the addition of NH4OH, and Cu2CO3(OH)2 with the addition
of urea, respectively. From these subsequent octahedral complex solutions,
the high concentration of OH– anions present from
the addition of NaOH mixture resulted in the formation of a [Cu(OH)4]2– ion complex which led to the formation
of the CuO nuclei. Thus, during each of these three synthetic routes,
NaOH operates as a pH buffer to control the pH value of the solution.
When the critical value of the concentration of the OH– and Cu2+ ions are achieved, the precipitation of CuO
nuclei begins. Initially, the CuO nuclei growth takes place by self-aggregation
to produce smaller crystallite size CuO nucleus. Further aggregation
leads to the formation of CuO nanoplatelets, corresponding to the
growth mechanism provided by Cao et al., where the addition of hydrazine
hydrate decreased the Gibbs free energy of the reaction system and
transformed the 2D nanoleaf to the 3D spherical morphology.11d

Figures 2a–f
and 3a–i show the SEM and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the platelet-like CuO nanostructures.
As shown in Figure 2, the size of the nanoplatelets decreased as the reaction mixture
was exposed to a longer reaction time, as seen for E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60, E-Urea-45 and E-Urea-60. The nanoplatelets structural units of C-NH4OH-45 and C-NH4OH-60 were arranged in flower-like structures
in the presence of NH4OH (see Figure 2e,f). The length of the nanoplatelets was
also affected (i.e., length decreases) with the increase in reaction
times. As shown in the size distribution of E-NaOH-60 and E-Urea-60 (Figure 3a,d insets), the length and diameter of the nanoplatelets
are affected by the change in base, displaying an average diameter
and length of approximately 8–12 and 40–80 nm, respectively.
More detailed crystallographic analyses on the CuO nanoplatelets were
performed by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and HR-TEM
analysis. The d-spacing of the CuO lattice was found
to be 0.23 and 0.25 nm corresponding to the (1̅11) and (111)
crystal planes of CuO crystal planes of CuO (see Figure 3b,e). The SAED patterns for E-NaOH-60 and E-Urea-60 show the diffused Debye
rings, denoting that the diameter of the platelets is small (see Figure 3c,f). The (1̅11),
(111), (110), and (200) crystal planes observed in the SAED pattern
confirm the monoclinic phase of the CuO nanoplatelet products. Because
of the large nature of the nanoplatelets of C-NH4OH-60, the SAED pattern predominantly
reveals brighter Debye rings with discrete spots, denoting that the
CuO flower-like structures are more polycrystalline in nature, as
seen in Figure 3g–i.
These observations are consistent with the XRD patterns showed in Figure 1a–c.

By varying the reaction times,
the surface areas and pore volumes
as determined by BET surface analyses were affected. Analyses confirmed
the surface area and pore volume of E-NaOH-60 was the
largest, compared to the other as-prepared CuO products (see Figure
S2 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information). As seen in Figure 4a–c, there is an inverse correlation between the BET surface
area and average crystallite sizes determined from the peaks associated
with the (111) and (1̅11) XRD planes, as a function of reactions
time. Experimentally, it was observed that extending the reaction
times to above 60 min led to a decrease in the surface area.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses
were employed to
understand the chemical state and shift of the oxygen and copper atoms
in the CuO products, as seen in Figures 5 and 6. The spectra, Figure 5a–f, reveal
doublet peaks located at around ∼933.1 and ∼953.3 eV
which can be assigned to the binding energies of Cu 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, characteristic to the values associated to
Cu2+. The two overlapping satellite shake-up peaks are
at ∼941.4 and ∼943.9 eV; and a strong satellite shake-up
peak is at ∼962.4 eV, further confirming the presence of Cu2+.13 Both CuO and Cu2O can be distinguished by the binding energy of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 in the Cu 2p XPS spectra because of the
difference of ∼1 eV for CuO and Cu2O.13a,13b,14 The O 1s core level spectra (see Figure 6a–f) of the
six samples contain three peaks: a main peak and smaller peak (blue
and light blue), Oi, at ∼529.3 and Oii, at 531 eV, where Oi is the O2– binding
with Cu2+ in the crystal lattice, the Oii peak
is caused by weakly adsorbed species, which include OH– or O22– species from the environment
and the smallest peak, and Oiii (light pink) at ∼532
eV is associated with weakly adsorbed oxygen species.15 The Oiv peak (light green) found at ∼533
eV is associated with the compensation of deficiencies in the subsurface
or oxygen-vacancy species.15

Photoluminescence (PL)
studies were conducted at room temperature,
with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm, to determine the amount of
point defects in the CuO products. The overlaid PL spectra of the
all six as-prepared products are shown in Figure 7a1–c1, with
the convoluted spectra of E-NaOH-60, E-Urea-60 and C-NH4OH-45 shown in Figure 7a–c2. The band at 410 nm (i.e., ∼3.0 eV)
corresponds to the band-edge emission. The defects peaks associated
with possible transition vacancy of oxygen (Vo) and interstitial
oxygen (Oi) in the blue-violet region (440–475 nm
or 2.61–2.82 eV) of the spectra are visible in the PL spectra,
as shown in Figure 7a–c2. The defect peaks related to singly ionized
oxygen vacancy (Vo+) and both O and Cu interstitial
(Oi and Cui) deficiencies are visible in the
green region (between 475 and 575 nm or 2.15 and 2.82 eV) of the PL
spectra. The peak located at the red region between 575 and 700 nm
(i.e., 2.15 and 1.77 eV) is associated with doubly ionized oxygen
vacancies (Vo++), for E-Urea-60.16

of the CuO products prepared in the presence of NaOH, NH4OH and urea, with the convoluted spectra of E-NaOH-75, C-NH4OH-45, and E-Urea-60 (a2–c2).

To further study the magnetic properties of the CuO products,
we
carried out magnetization measurements at 10 K under a maximum applied
magnetic field of 10 000 Oe with a by vibrating sample magnetometer
(VSM). Figure 8 displays
the magnetization versus magnetic field (M–H) curves for the CuO nanostructures. The small hysteresis
loop observed at lower field indicates the E-NaOH-45 containing
both ferromagnetic (FM) and paramagnetic (PM) features (see Figure 8a). Such behavior
is also observed for the C-NH4OH-60 (see Figure 8d). Although the FM contribution exists for the E-NaOH-60, a superimposed negative contribution turns out
to be dominant (see Figure 8b). This diamagnetic temperature-independent involvement may
originate from filled electronic d-shell of the Cu2O layer.
No peaks related to Cu2O were observed during XRD analyses
(see Figure 1a); however,
the presence of Cu2O was confirmed by XPS analyses (see Figure 5b). This diamagnetic
contribution to the total magnetization becomes dominant at higher
fields. A clear hysteresis loop is witnessed for C-NH4OH-45 (see Figure 8c). Strong PM signals are evident
for E-urea-45 and E-urea-60 (see Figure 8e,f); corresponding
to the XPS analyses where large amounts of Cu2+ ions are
observed in the products (see Figure 5c,d). C-NH4OH-45 showed the largest saturation magnetization of (i.e.,
0.1 emu/g), while saturation magnetization for the E-urea-60 was too small to detect.

2.2 Gas Sensing
Analyses of CuO Nanomaterials
2.2.1 CuO Sensing Performance
The performance
testing further include exposing the sensors to various concentrations
of preselected gases [test gases including NH3, CO, CH4, NO2, H2S and IPA] in dry air and humidity
conditions, at room temperature. These gases were selected as cross-sensing
gases because recent reports showed that South Africa is currently
one of the largest emitters of NOx, while
other gaseous emissions of concern include the presence of NH3, CO, and other sulphur-related compounds. Even though VOC’s
emissions in the South African atmosphere are currently limited, the
sensors were exposed to one VOC gas (i.e., IPA gas) for future reference.
The calculated response, S, is defined as ((Ra – Rg)/Rg) × 100%) in the oxidizing gas (i.e.,
NO2) atmosphere, where Ra and Rg are resistance of the sensor in air and in
testing gas atmosphere, respectively.17 For the initial gas selectivity screening, each gas concentration
was pulsed for 5 min, followed by synthetic air for 5 min.

Selectivity
is a vital parameter for gas-sensing application. Such selectivity
between NO2 and other interferences gases such as IPA,
NH3, H2S, CO, and CH4 remains the
fundamental challenges for practical NO2 MOX-based nanosensors.
The gas-sensing responses of the CuO nanostructures prepared using
various bases at different reaction times were tested toward various
gases at room temperature, and the results are presented in Figure 9. As displayed in
the histogram, the E-NaOH-45, E-NaOH-60,
and E-urea-60 show improved response to NO2 gases compared to other gases. Sensors E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60 showed response of values of approximately 2465
and 2498% to 40 ppm NO2 gas, respectively, at room temperature
in dry air conditions. These findings clearly show that the sensor
response to NO2 gas is reaction base and time dependent.
None of the sensors showed a response to H2S or CO gas.
All relevant sensors’ performance data related to CH4 sensing are showed in the Supporting Information (see Figures S7 and S8). To be specific, it is important to note
that large drifts in sensor current (i.e., sensor instability) were
observed in the presence of CH4 gas, which in turn made
it difficult to determine the maximum response values. By ignoring
the drift, the maximum response values of between 1700 and 2100 was
estimated for sensors E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60, to 40 ppm CH4.

2.2.2 NO2 Sensing in Various Atmospheres
The dynamic curves are provided in terms of resistance and are
displayed in logarithmic scale in order to allow for a better comparison
between the changes of the sensor signals (relative change of the
resistance). The high response of E-NaOH-45-, E-NaOH-60-, and E-urea-60-based gas sensors to NO2 gas
is attributed to the presence of weakly adsorbed oxygen species and
the higher relative concentration of point defects (confirmed by XPS
and PL analyses, see Figures 6 and 7, respectively) which act as
favorable adsorption sites for chemisorbed oxygen species to participate
in the reaction than that of other CuO nanomaterials. Our previous
work and that of other researchers have shown that defects have a
direct influence on the sensing performance of the materials.7f,18 The E-NaOH-60-based gas sensor is considered as the
superior performing NO2 gas-sensitive material because
it showed a response to lower concentrations (i.e., 5 ppm) of NO2 gas, compared to that of E-urea-60, as seen
in Figures 10 and 11. As expected, p-type conductivity was observed
for the E-NaOH-45-, E-NaOH-60-, and E-urea-60-based gas sensor products in NO2 gas
conditions (see Figures 10 and 11). A large drift in sensor resistance
(see Figure 10a,b)
was observed, which was can normally attributed to low rate of diffusion
of gas molecules away from the surface of the sensor at low operating
temperatures. However, at higher NO2 concentrations, the
sensors recover quicker than at lower concentrations, irrespective
of the operating temperature. The trend occurs irrespective of the
presence of humidity (see Figure 10b,c). The relationship between the sensor drift and
sensor response of E-NaOH-60 over a period of 12 h can
be seen in Figure S4, Supporting Information, thus leading us to conclude that at lower concentration the NO2 molecules chemically bond to the active sites on the surface
of the sensing layer. At higher concentrations, however, a combination
of chemi- and physisorption occurs because the NO2 molecules
are competing for the same active sites. Prolonging the duration of
the gas cycles (see Figure S5, Supporting Information) also proved to be ineffective. The interaction on the gas–solid
interface is dependent on the competition between the oxidizing gas
and the water vapor for the preadsorbed oxygen species.

cycles and (b,c) the dynamic resistance curve and calculated response

various (RH %) conditions at room temperature. *Note: the lines visible
in (d) are not experimental data; it is used to guide the reader.

During the exposure of sensor E-urea-60 to four cycles
of 40 ppm NO2, limited drift in sensor resistance is observed
compared to that of the sensor in varying concentrations (see Figure 11a,b). This can
be ascribed to the prolonged duration of the gas cycles which allowed
the gas molecules efficient time to diffuse away from the surface
of the sensor. A decline in sensor resistance was observed after the
sensor was exposed to NO2 in humid conditions (as seen
in Figure 11c). The
drift in resistance of the E-urea-60 sensor in the presence
of humidity can be attributed to the gradual formation of stable chemisorbed
OH-groups at the oxide surface for prolonged exposure.19 Compared to dry air condition, a decrease in
the sensor response for E-urea-60 was observed in testing
conditions with more moisture present (see Figures 9 and 11d).

2.2.3 Stability of Sensors in the NO2 Atmosphere
When exposing the E-NaOH-45, E-NaOH-60,
and E-urea-60 sensors to NO2 in dry air and
humidity conditions after aging for a year, more
complex gas-sensing performances are observed (see Figures 12 and S7 in the Supporting Information). An increase in initial
sensor resistance (i.e., before the target gas was introduced) was
observed for the sensors (see Figure 10a,b compared to Figure 12a,b), which can be ascribed to the presence
of additional adsorbed species, like H2O and O–, on the surface of the sensors leading to overall increase in sensor
conductivity. Under dry air conditions, a more pronounced drift in
both the sensors’ resistance was observed (see Figure 12a). The NO2 species
is most likely to now bond to the additional active sites on the surface
of the sensing layers. In the scenario where the sensing performance
is tested in dry air conditions (see Figure 12a), prolonging duration of the gas cycles
even more (i.e., 20 and 20 min: gas in and gas out) or heating the
sensors to above 100 °C between gas NO2 gas cycles
may remove the additional species, thus regenerating (restore) the
sensors to their original condition. However, enhanced sensing performance
for E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60 was observed
in the presence of humidity (see Figure 12b,c). Because of the likelihood of additional
adsorbed species present on the surface of the sensing layer, the
most likely scenario is the reaction of preadsorbed oxygen, namely
O–, with water resulting in the formation of terminal
hydroxyl groups (i.e., the cause of more distinct the sensor drift
in more humid atmosphere). Thus, the interaction mechanism is now
dependent on the competition between the oxidizing gas and the water
for the additional preadsorbed oxygen species.

2.2.4 Gas-Sensing Mechanism Arising from the Material
Properties
The manner in which the conduction occurs in the
MOX sensing layer is important for the magnitude of the sensor signal
(sensor response).20 The general sensing
mechanisms of the semiconductor gas sensors are based on the ionosorption
and oxygen-vacancy models.5b The adsorption
and desorption of test gas on the surface of the CuO-based gas sensor
leads to the changes of electrical resistance and directly affect
the response to the test gas. In general, the gas-sensing response
of MOX-based gas sensors can be described as follows 1  where a and b are
constants, S is the response of sensor, and C is the concentration of target gas. The value of b is normally from 0.5 to 1 which depends on the charge
of the surface species and stoichiometry of the elementary reactions
on the sensor surface. The b value is 0.5 when the
adsorbed surface oxygen ion is O2–, and the b value is between 0.5 and 1 or just above 1 when the adsorbed
surface oxygen ion is O–. Therefore, the oxygen
species adsorbed on the surface of the gas sensor can be deduced by
the b value. At a certain working temperature, eq 2 can be rewritten as 2  There is a linear relation between log(S –
1) and log(C), and b is the slope
of the linear function. Figure 13a shows the relationship between the response
of E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60- and E-NaOH-60-based sensors and the NOx concentration,
and the corresponding curve of log(S – 1)
≈ log(C) is shown in Figure 13b. The calculated b is
1.0 and 1.139, respectively, which signifies that O– species are adsorbed on the surface of the sensing layers.

Figure 13 Relationship
between (a) calculated response, S, of sensors E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60 and
the NO2 concentration at room temperature (22 °C)
and (b) corresponding log(S – 1)–log(C) curves.

It is suggested that
in the case of these CuO sensors, the NO2 firstly reacts
with the available adsorbed O– species forming NO2–(ads) species.
Then, a hole-accumulation layer is created at the boundaries of the
CuO nanograins by chemisorption of NO2. The generation
of holes makes the p-type CuO nanoplatelets more conductive. 3  

When the flow of NO2 gas is stopped, the adsorbed NO2–(ads) species evaporates, leaving behind
the captured electrons in the p-type CuO and decreasing the hole density
by electron–hole compensation, resulting in the change in resistance.
If however the NO2–(ads) species does
not evaporate or diffuse away from the surface, no electron is donated
back into the CuO bulk; thus, the hole density is not decreased (i.e.,
drift in sensor resistance is observed).

For the aged sensors,
the surface chemisorbed O–(ads) and NO2–(ads), as well as their
interactions, have a significant impact on the sensing properties
because there is more O–(ads), as illustrated by
the following reactions. 4   5   6  

As is known, the fundamental
principle of gas-sensing MOX materials
depends on the change in the resistance (or conductivity) in the sensor’s
circuit when exposing it to different atmospheres (i.e., different
gases). It is established that the gas-sensing performance is influenced
by many factors, such as the charge carrier concentration on the surface
of the sensing materials, morphology, and large surface-to-volume
ratio of the sensing materials.20,21 In the present study,
the variations in charge carrier concentrations and morphology were
found to change the gas-sensing characteristics of the CuO nanostructures.
To get a further indication of the factors that influenced the NO2 gas-sensing performance of E-urea-60, E-NaOH-45, and E-NaOH-60, in dry air conditions,
their calculated NO2 response at 40 ppm was compared to
the crystallite size, surface area, carrier concentration (as seen
in the Supporting Information, Figure S3:
Hall-effect analyses) and defects (determined by PL and XPS analyses)
as seen in Figure 14a–d. From this comparison, it is apparent that the enhanced
response of E-urea-60 and E-NaOH-45, to
NO2 gas, respectively, was mostly influenced by the crystallite
size, surface area, and the carrier concentration of the sensing materials.
To be specific, the largest surface area of 67.6 m2 g–1 by E-NaOH-60 showed an enhanced NO2 gas sensitivity with a response of 2498% at 40 ppm, followed
by E-NaOH-45 with a response of 2465% and a surface area
of 64.8 m2 g–1. As the crystallite sizes
decreased, the gas-sensing response toward NO2 gas decreases,
denoting that in this case (taking all of the material properties
into account) the optimum grain size contributing is 9.7 nm. A previous
report has disclosed that the performance of the sensing can be enhanced
by manipulating the size of the nanostructures to a critical value
of approximately 14 nm.22 The gas-sensing
performance of similar CuO nanostructures, such as nanoleaves and
platelet-like building blocks arranged as hierarchical structures,
were reported to be selective to VOC’s at higher operating
temperatures.10f,11d Selectivity to NO2 gas was reported for chromium-doped CuO nanorods at 250 °C,
by Lee et al.23 Limited cases were reported
where undoped CuO nanostructure-based gas sensors showed selectivity
to NO2 gas at room temperature;7f,24 however, other studies include the enhanced NO2 response
of NiO nanosheets5a,8b and at room temperature.8b

3 Conclusions
Various
CuO nanoplatelets were successfully prepared and characterized,
before being subjected to gas-sensing performance analyses at room
temperature (22 °C) in dry and humid conditions. Both CuO products,
prepared at 75 °C for 45 and 60 min in the presence of NaOH,
and urea (E-NaOH-45, E-NaOH-60 and E-urea-60), showed promise as NO2 gas sensors,
respectively. E-NaOH-60, with an average crystalline
size of 9.7 nm and largest surface area of 67.6 m2 g–1 and highest carrier concentration, showed an enhanced
response of 2498%, while E-urea-60 (i.e., crystallite
size of 7.7 nm and surface area of 56.1 m2 g–1) showed a smaller response of 469% to 40 ppm of NO2 gas
at room temperature in dry air. This could be attributed to the much
larger specific area, the more active sites and the more abundant
hole concentration provided by the E-NaOH-60 nanoplatelets.
This finding contributes to the research and development of NO2 selective p-type MOX-based gas sensor operating at room temperature.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All
reagents were of analytical
grade and used as purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The NH3, CO, H2S, NO2 and CH4 gases were
purchased from AFROX, South Africa.

4.2 Preparation
of CuO Nanostructures
As shown in ref (7f), the CuO powders, E-NaOH: 75 °C, C-NH4OH: 55 °C, and E-Urea: 75 °C,
were prepared under specific reaction conditions and
exhibited the best gas-sensing performance. During this study, the
same preparation method used in ref (7f) was followed, under the relevant reaction temperatures,
that is, 55 and 75 °C; however, the reaction times were prolonged
to 45 and 60 min in this case. Forgoing the chosen notation, resulting
CuO products were denoted as E-NaOH-45 and E-NaOH-60, according to the reaction temperature (75 °C), time, and the
base used (NaOH). Thus, in the cases where NH4OH was used
in the preparation of CuO nanostructures, the products were denoted
as C-NH4OH-45 and C-NH4OH-60, while the
products prepared in the presence of urea were denoted E-urea-45 and E-urea-60, respectively.

4.3 Characterization
The structural features
and phase purity of the synthesized CuO nanoparticles were investigated
using an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X′-pert PRO-PW 3040/60)
fitted with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.1541 nm) radiation source,a
HORIBA Jobin-Yvon HR800 Raman microscope at room temperature and transmission
electron microscope (Tecnai F20). XPS analyses were carried out using
a PHI 5000 Versaprobe-scanning ESCA microprobe. A low-energy Ar+ ion gun and low-energy neutralizer electron gun were used
to minimize charging on the surface. Monochromatic Al Kα radiation
(hν = 1486.6 eV) was used as the excitation
source. The morphology was characterized using a SEM (Zeiss). The
optical emission properties were characterized at room temperature
using a pulsed laser-PL spectrometer, equipped with a Kimmon He–Cd
laser. The surface area and pore size distribution were analyzed using
a N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm (Micromeritics
TRISTAR 300 surface area analyzer, USA). For magnetization measurements
at low temperature, the VSM platform of a Dynacool facility was used
(Quantum Design, USA). This platform enables measurement of magnetic
moment to an accuracy of ±0.5% and with a noise rejection rate
of better than 6H10–7 emu.

4.4 Fabrication
and Analyses of Sensing Layer
The gas-sensing properties
of the as-prepared CuO platelets powder
were analyzed using a KSGAS6S gas testing station (Kenosistec, Italy). Figure 15 shows the schematic
diagram of the gas testing station.

Figure 15 Schematic diagram of the gas testing
station used during the gas-sensing
analyses.

As we reported previously, prior
to gas-sensing analyses, the sensing
layers were fabricated by dispersing the as-prepared CuO powders in
ethanol before it was drop-coated onto alumina substrates (containing
a heater on the bottom side) and dried in an oven at 100 °C for
1 h. The average thickness of the sensing layers range between 15
and 20 μm (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3a,b).

The fabricated sensors were placed in an airtight
chamber and tested
for sensitivity toward NH3, CO, CH4, NO2, H2S, and IPA gases at room temperature. The fabricated
sensors were exposed to gas concentrations ranging from 5, 10 to 100
ppm with 10 ppm intervals. Dry air atmosphere (79% nitrogen and 21%
oxygen, i.e., 0% relative humidity) and relative humidity (RH) of
10–60% conditions were used to conduct the measurements. The
resistance of the device was measured using a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage
source meter.
