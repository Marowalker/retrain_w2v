The
current work reports the synthesis of carboxymethyl cellulose
(CMC) and xylan-based homopolymerized as well as copolymerized hydrogels
using an ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether cross-linker in alkaline
medium. The hydrogels are physically characterized by the swelling
ratio and gel fraction. The morphological observation of hydrogels
reveals the porous structure for the copolymerized gels. The rheological
behavior of the gels elaborates that the copolymerized CMC–xylan
gel synthesized in a 1:1 molar ratio has superior strain-bearing ability
and possesses the shortest gelation temperature and time. Vitamin
B12 here is used as the model vitamin to be loaded in the
hydrogels and subsequent studies involving the in vitro release in
artificial gastric fluid (AGF, pH = 1.2), artificial intestinal fluid
(AIF, pH = 6.8), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4). The
synthesized gels show a cumulative release of 19–28% in AGF,
80–88% in AIF, and 93–98% in PBS, independently. Further,
the highest cumulative release of 93–99% is recorded for all
gels when in vitro release is performed in successive buffers, that
is, first in AGF, followed by AIF and PBS.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Hydrogels are physical or chemical cross-linked three-dimensional
polymer networks which swell upon absorbing water but do not dissolve
in it. The network often mimics the extracellular matrix and is thus
widely used in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and other biological
applications.1 The shape and volume of
hydrogels can be reversibly changed upon various external stimuli
such as pH, temperature, light, electric and magnetic fields. Polysaccharides
are renewable natural polymers bearing the advantages which include
nontoxicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and natural abundance.
The ease of functionalization or chemical cross-linking of the hydroxyl
moieties present in the backbone of polysaccharides make them attractive
precursors for hydrogels.

Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is a
water-soluble derivative of
cellulose in which some of the hydroxyl moieties are replaced by carboxymethyl
moiety. It is conveniently produced by the alkali-catalyzed reaction
between cellulose and chloroacetic acid. It is widely used as thickener,
viscosity modifier, emulsion stabilizer, and water retention agent
in paint, cosmetic, and food industries. Low immunogenicity, high
biocompatibility, and biodegradability make it a potential carrier
for controlled release or site-specific drug delivery.2,3 For this, it got approval from FDA for biomedical applications.4 CMC is also used as a precursor for stimuli-responsive
hydrogels. The carboxymethyl group adds a negative charge to the pyranose
backbone, and it significantly increases the cross-linking points
and reactive sites. Thus, thermal radical reactions are often employed
with the cross-linker to prepare CMC-based homopolymer and copolymer
hydrogels.5,6 Overall, the CMC-based hydrogels are used
as carriers for drugs and biological macromolecules.7

Xylan is a heteropolysaccharide consisting of pentoses
and hexoses.
It belongs to the hemicellulose family and found in most abundant
quantity in the family. Xylan consists of 80–200 d-xylopyranosyl residues as backbone, which are connected by β-(1
→ 4) glycosidic bonds.8 The backbone
is linked with the O-acetyl, glucoronic acid side
groups.9 Xylan is obtained from hardwood
by the alkali extraction method. Like cellulose, hemicellulose as
well as xylan can be easily functionalized because of the abundance
of the hydroxyl moiety. The various subclasses of hemicellulose are
used as thickeners, emulsifiers, coatings, and additives in paper,
food, and pharmaceutical industries.10,11 Recently,
xylan-based hydrogels have gained attention because of the multiresponsive
behavior toward pH, organic solvents, and ions. A good number of literature
is available for the xylan-based hydrogels as carriers for drug and
biological macromolecules12 and sorbents
for heavy metal ions and organic dyes.13,14

Vitamin
B12 (VB12, cyanocobalamin) is the
largest and the most complex in the vitamin family. It is an organometallic
compound containing cobalt within a corrin ring. The main residues
are corrin ring, propyl side chain, ribose group, and dimethylbenzimidazole.
Because of its low bioavailability (recommended 1–5 μg
per day), it is considered as an essential nutrient. The different
chemical structures of cyanocobalamin and its derivatives are shown
in Figure 1. Two of
the major active forms are methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.
Methylcobalamin is needed by methionine synthase to produce the amino
acid methionine from homocysteine, whereas adenosylcobalamin is used
as a cofactor by methylmalonyl–coenzyme A to produce succinyl
coenzyme A, which is required to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle.15 Aquacobalamin bears a neutral ligand that results
in a positively charged molecule and is therefore always accompanied
by a counter anion.16 The deficiency of
cobalt in human is treated with the controlled release of VB12 which increases the concentration level of cobalt in blood serum
and liver. The ribose group plays an important role in the synthesis
of nucleic acids and the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides.
Jin et al. reported that VB12 is prescribed to alleviate
the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia, allergic asthma, and allergic
rhinitis.17 Further, the sustained level
of VB12 eases the pain associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
The deficiency can lead to weakness, fatigue, constipation, and other
neurological malfunctions.18

Figure 1 Structure of
VB12.15

A moderate number of literature is available for the controlled
release of various vitamins including VB12. To the best
of our knowledge, the earliest reported VB12 release was
by using cross-linked poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone)
polyacrylamide and acrylic acid-based hydrogels.19,20 A more recent investigation on the diffusion mechanism of VB12 was studied by Jin et al.17 using
poly(acrylic acid) and copolymeric acrylic acid and N-vinyl pyrrolidinone-based hydrogels. Further Maheswari et al. investigated
the release profile of VB12 using thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) hydrogels.21 CMC-based
hydrogels are recently being explored for the release of VB12. Boruah et al. reported the in vitro release of VB12 using
CMC-grafted poly(acrylic acid) and organophilic montmorillonite nanoclay
composite hydrogel.22 Further, Nath and
Dolui reported CMC-grafted poly(acrylic acid) and layered double hydroxide
(LDH) hydrogels for the in vitro release study of VB12.23 Multiresponsive xylan-based hydrogels are reported
by Cao et al. for the release of VB12.24 The hydrogel is formed with xylan-type hemicellulose methacrylate
and 4-[(4-acryloyloxyphenyl)azo]benzoic acid, using the free-radical
copolymerization method.

Herein, we have synthesized pure CMC,
pure xylan hydrogels, and
CMC–xylan hydrogels in different molar ratios. The interconnected
cross-linked structure is fabricated using an ethylene glycol diglycidyl
ether (EGDE) cross-linker. The hydrogels are characterized by Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and the morphology of the
hydrogels is viewed by an optical microscope and a field emission
scanning electron microscope. The rheological behavior of the as-synthesized
hydrogels is performed at 25 °C. By varying the shear rate in
a wide range, the viscosity of the gels is measured. Frequency sweep
is used to observe the detailed viscoelastic behavior of the gels
as well as to measure the gel point of the hydrogels. Thereafter,
temperature sweep is performed to identify the gelation temperature.
The time sweep then determines the gelation time. Swelling ratios
(SRs) at various pHs and gel fractions are measured to determine the
physical characteristics of the gel. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to prepare a chemically cross-linked cellulose–hemicellulose-based
hydrogel. VB12 is used as a model vitamin to be loaded
in the hydrogels. The in vitro release of VB12 is carried
out in artificial gastric fluid (AGF, pH = 1.2), artificial intestinal
fluid (AIF, pH = 6.8), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4).

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
The
CMC sodium salt and
beechwood xylan (xylan) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Auxiliary
chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, sodium chloride, potassium dihydrogen
phosphate, and hydrochloric acid (37 wt %) were purchased from Merck.
EGDE and vitamin B12 were purchased from TCI India. PBS
was purchased from HiMedia. All the chemicals were used as received.
Deionized (DI) water was supplied from the in-house Millipore water
synthesis unit (make: Millipore, model: ELix-3).

2.2 Preparation of Hydrogels
The synthesis
of hydrogels is divided into three distinct steps, namely (i) preparation
of precursors, (ii) synthesis of hydrogels by the addition of cross-linkers,
and (iii) purification of hydrogels. The schematic of the three steps
are given in Figure 2. In the first step, the precursor solutions of CMC and xylan were
separately dissolved in 1 mol L–1 aqueous NaOH solution.
After obtaining homogeneous solutions, xylan and CMC were mixed in
25:75 mol % (hereby denoted as XC25), 50:50 mol % (hereby denoted
as XC50), and 75:25 mol % (hereby denoted as XC75), respectively.
Next, the solutions were transferred into round-bottom flasks and
then heated to 50 °C to get homogeneous mixtures. The EGDE cross-linker
was added dropwise into the solutions. Gelation was seen to complete
within 15 min. After the formation of gels, they were thoroughly washed
with DI water to remove the unreacted monomers and the cross-linker.
Thereafter, they were neutralized with 0.1 M HCl solution and subsequently
lyophilized for further characterization (freeze dryer, make: Martin
Christ, model: Alpha 2-4 LD). In addition to the copolymerized CMC–xylan
gel, EGDE was also added dropwise into pure xylan and pure CMC solutions
to prepare pure xylan (hereby denoted as xylan gel) and pure CMC (hereby
denoted as CMC gel), respectively. The cross-linking scheme of the
hydrogels is given in Figure 3.

Figure 2 Schematic of hydrogel synthesis.

Figure 3 Reaction scheme of the hydrogel formation: (a) CMC gel, (b) xylan
gel, and (c) CMC–xylan gel.

2.3 Characterization
2.3.1 FT-IR
Spectroscopy
The hydrogels
were grinded and mixed with an excess amount of dried potassium bromide
(KBr). Later, the mixed powder was placed in a hydraulic press to
prepare transparent pellets. The pellets were placed in an FT-IR spectrometer
(make: Shimadzu, model: IRAffinity-1), and the transmission spectra
were recorded within the range of 400–4000 cm–1 using 30 scans per sample with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

2.3.2 Morphology
The morphology of the
hydrogels was observed with an optical microscope (make: Carl Zeiss,
model: Scope A1, AXIO, software: ZEN 2.3) and a field emission scanning
electron microscope (make: Carl Zeiss, model: GeminiSEM 300). For
optical microscopic images, the freeze-dried hydrogels were placed
on a glass slide and covered with a coverslip. For field emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images, the hydrogels were placed
on a carbon tape and placed on a stub. The stub was later sputter-coated
with gold. The measurement was carried out at a potential of 3 kV
at an optical zoom of 1 μm and 200 nm.

2.3.3 Rheology
The rheological studies
of hydrogels were performed on a rheometer (make: Anton Paar (Austria),
model: Physica MCR 301) using cone-and-plate geometry (diameter: 50
mm, angle: 1°, 0.1 mm gap) at 25 °C. The flow behavior of
the hydrogels was determined within a shear rate of 1 × 10–2 to 1 × 103 s–1.
To find the storage moduli (G′), loss moduli
(G″), and linear viscoelastic region (LVR)
profiles, amplitude test was performed at a constant angular frequency
of 1 Hz and within a strain of 1 × 10–1 to
1 × 103%. Frequency sweep test of the gels was performed
at a constant strain of 1% within a frequency of 1 × 10–2 to 1 × 103 Hz. The constant strain of 1% is obtained
from LVR. The loss tangent (tan δ) is determined from the loss
and storage moduli obtained from the frequency sweep test and is defined
as the ratio of viscous to elastic response. The expression is given
as 1  

The temperature
sweep of the precursor
solution was performed at a temperature range of 25–80 °C
with 1% of strain obtained from LVR and with 1 Hz frequency obtained
from the frequency sweep test. The time sweep of the precursor solution
was performed for 60 min at the corresponding gelation temperature
with 1% of strain obtained from LVR and with 1 Hz frequency obtained
from the frequency sweep test.

2.3.4 Equilibrium
Swelling Ratio
Swelling
determines the amount of water absorbed by the hydrogel within a certain
period. We determined the equilibrium SR of the hydrogel, that is,
the highest amount of water absorbed by the hydrogel after attaining
equilibrium weight. Briefly, a certain amount of freeze-dried hydrogel
was submerged into the pH buffer or DI water for 48 h at 25 °C.
The hydrogel was allowed to swell inside the buffer or DI water to
attain equilibrium. After 48 h, the hydrogel was filtered to remove
the excess water, after which the weight was measured. The equilibrium
SR is measured as 2  where Wi is the
weight of the freeze-dried hydrogel and Weq is the equilibrium weight of the hydrogel. The swelling was measured
in AGF (pH = 1.2), AIF (pH = 6.8), PBS (pH = 7.4), and DI water. The
pHs of the solutions were adjusted by a digital pH meter (make: Eutech
Instruments, model: EUTECH pH700).

2.3.5 Gel
Fraction
Gel fraction was calculated
as described in the literature.25 Fridge-dried
hydrogel was heated at 60 °C for 24 h, and the weight was measured
(W0). Therefore, the hydrogel was immersed
in DI water to remove the soluble parts and heated at 121 °C
for 4 h. The excess amount of water was filtered and further dried
at 60 °C for 72 h. The final weight was measured as W1. The gel fraction is then given by 3  

Both equilibrium SR and gel fraction
measurements were performed in triplicate, and the standard deviation
is represented in terms of error bars.

2.4 Loading
of VB12
Preweighed
amounts of freeze-dried hydrogels were immersed in 20 mL of VB12 solution (0.5 mg mL–1). The sample tubes
were kept in an orbital shaker (make: Daihan Labtech, model: LSI 3016R)
for 48 h at 25 °C (±0.5 °C) and 120 rpm under dark
conditions. After 48 h, the tubes were placed in a centrifuge at 10 000
rpm to obtain clear supernatants. Later, the samples were filtered
to separate the vitamin-loaded gels and the supernatants. Later, the
vitamin-loaded gels were freeze-dried. An appropriate volume of the
supernatant was collected and appropriately diluted to measure the
concentration of the remaining VB12 by UV–vis spectroscopy.
The amount of vitamin loaded in the hydrogel (VB12 loading)
is calculated by26 4  

2.5 Preparation of AGF and AIF
AGF was
prepared by adding 2.0 gm of sodium chloride and 7.0 mL of hydrochloric
acid (37 wt %) in a 1000 mL volumetric flask. The final volume was
made up to 1000 mL by adding DI water until the pH became 1.2. AIF
was prepared by dissolving 6.8 gm of potassium dihydrogen phosphate
in 500 mL of DI water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 6.8
and the final volume of the solution was made upto 1000 mL. Both the
preparation methods are duly adopted from the literature.27

2.6 Release of VB12
The release
of VB12 was carried out in three buffers, namely, AGF,
AIF, and PBS, respectively. The VB12-loaded dried hydrogels
were placed in buffers, and 20 mL of the buffer solution was added.
The solutions were placed in the same orbital shaker at 37 °C
(±0.5 °C) at 60 rpm. After each hour, 5 mL of the buffer
solution was collected and replaced by 5 mL of fresh buffer solution
to maintain equal volume. The method of collection of aliquots has
also been adopted from the literature.5 The collected aliquots were filtered to remove any fragment of the
hydrogel. The amount of VB12 in the aliquots was determined
by UV–vis spectroscopy.

2.7 UV–Vis
Spectroscopy
The concentration
of VB12 in the supernatant solutions and aliquots was measured
against the standard calibration curve. The calibration curve was
plotted with the absorbance values of VB12 solutions against
the known concentrations of VB12. The known concentrations
were prepared by appropriate dilutions of the stock VB12 solution (1 mg mL–1). Thereafter, the absorbance
of the supernatant solutions and aliquots were measured with a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (make: Shimadzu, model: UV-2600). Separate calibration
curves were plotted for AGF, AIF, PBS buffers (for the aliquots),
and DI water (for the supernatants).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 FT-IR Spectra
Figure 4 represents
the FT-IR characterization of
pure CMC, pure xylan, synthesized CMC gel, xylan gel, and CMC–xylan
gel. The major characteristic peaks of CMC and xylan are O–H
stretching, C–H stretching, C–O stretching, C–H
bending, C–C bending, skeletal vibrations of C–O and
C–C in the pyranose ring, antisymmetric β-(1 →
4) glycosidic linkage, and C–H glycosidic deformation. The
FT-IR spectra of pure CMC and pure xylan are shown in Figure 4a,b. The O–H stretching
of pure CMC and pure xylan are assigned at 3568 and 3449 cm–1, respectively. The C–H stretchings of both are assigned at
2900 cm–1. The stretching of C–O is assigned
at 1612 cm–1 for pure CMC and 1637 cm–1 for pure xylan. The bending of −CH2 is assigned
at 1420 cm–1 for both cases. The skeletal vibrations
are also observed at 1320 and 1338 cm–1, respectively.
For pure CMC, the bending of C–C is assigned at 1057 cm–1, and the same for pure xylan is assigned at 1042
cm–1.

Figure 4 FT-IR spectra: (a) pure CMC, (b) pure xylan,
(c) CMC gel, (d) xylan
gel, and (e) CMC–xylan.

The characteristic peaks in the FT-IR spectra of CMC gel,
xylan
gel, and CMC–xylan gel (Figure 4c–e) are found in similar positions. For the
hydrogels, the stretching of O–H varies in the range of 3392–3455
cm–1. A doublet peak of 2914–2920 and 2875–2881
cm–1 represents C–H stretching and bending,
respectively. C–O stretching is assigned at 1647 cm–1. The bending of −CH2 is assigned at 1454–1458
cm–1. The skeletal vibrations are shifted in the
range of 1338–1361 cm–1. Kono et al. report
the bending of C–C at 1064 cm–1,28 and Sekkal et al. report the antisymmetric β-(1
→ 4) glycosidic linkage at 1090 cm–1.29 For this, the broad peak at 1080–1088
cm–1 is collectively considered as the merger of
antisymmetric β-(1 → 4) glycosidic linkage and bending
of C–C. The glycosidic deformation of C–H with ring
vibration is assigned at 843–876 cm–1.

3.2 Morphology of Hydrogels
The morphology
of the hydrogels visualized by a field emission scanning electron
microscope and an optical microscope is shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. From the FESEM images (Figure 5), the microstructure of the xylan gel appears
to be coarse in nature with random elongations. The random elongations
create uneven pores and an increased surface area which may act as
possible complex formation sites for VB12. In contrast
to the xylan gel, CMC gel appears to have an uneven surface only.
The beads visible on the surface may be the sodium ions of the CMC
sodium salt. The presence of sodium ions on the surface reflects the
presence of carboxymethyl chains attached to the pyranose ring of
CMC, and for this reason VB12 easily binds with the CMC
gel. However, the copolymerized CMC–xylan gel has a porous
structure. The pores are well-attributed to absorb VB12 inside the pore wall, enabling a higher uptake of VB12. The hydrogels appear to be glossy and coarse in the optical microscopic
images (Figure 6a–c).
The VB12-loaded hydrogels are further visualized using
an optical microscope and are given in Figure 6d–f. Upon loading of VB12, the hydrogels do not lose their glossy appearance, and the vitamin
is seen to absorb throughout the surface.

3.3 Rheological Analysis
The rheological
behavior of hydrogels is displayed in Figure 7. The viscosity of the gels is measured at
25 °C within a shear rate of 0.01–1000 s–1 and is shown in Figure 7a. For all the hydrogels, with an increasing shear rate, the
viscosity decreases, referring to the shear-thinning behavior of the
hydrogels. At a high rate (>100 s–1), the viscosities
of all hydrogels are found in a similar region, although the distinct
nature of curves is visible at a lower shear rate. This is attributed
to the loosening of the cross-linking structure at a high shear rate.
The shear-thinning behavior of the hydrogels is further confirmed
by fitting the flow behavior in the power-law model.

Figure 7 Rheology of hydrogels:
(a) viscosity, (b) amplitude sweep, and
(c) frequency sweep.

The power-law equation in terms of apparent viscosity is 5  where
η is the viscosity, γ̇
is the shear rate, n is the power-law index, and m is the consistency index. The values of the parameters
of the power-law model are given in Table 1. The power-law index for all hydrogels is
less than unity, which mathematically confirms the shear-thinning
nature of gels with increasing shear rate. The goodness of fit is
expressed in terms of correlation coefficient (R2), the values of which are given in Table 1.

Table 1 Power-Law Parameters

hydrogel	M	n	R2	
CMC gel	5.23 × 104	0.422	0.96	
XC25	3.54 × 104	0.524	0.89	
XC50	8.64 ×104	0.451	0.94	
XC75	5.86 × 104	0.507	0.80	
xylan gel	6.75 × 104	0.454	0.95	
We further
carried out the amplitude sweep test of the hydrogels
to find out the storage and loss moduli of the gels. The amplitude
sweep is reported in Figure 7b within the strain range of 0.1–1000% at 25 °C.
For all gels, we observe a crossover at 500% of strain, and storage
modules dominate over the loss modulus. The LVR is determined with
1% strain, and to confirm the viscoelastic characteristics, we performed
the frequency sweep test, with a 1% strain constant. For the copolymerized
gels, the dominance of storage modulus over the loss modulus reflects
the solid-like behavior of the gels within the range of the strain
considered. Figure 7c represents the frequency sweep plot of the gels at 25 °C,
1% strain, and 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. For all the gels,
the dominance of storage moduli (G′) is observed
over the loss moduli (G″) until the crossover
point, which typically appears after 10 Hz. Among all the gels, XC50
(50 mol % xylan/50 mol % CMC) shows the highest crossover frequency
at 54.43 Hz which reflects that the structure of this gel can accommodate
larger deformations than the pure CMC and xylan gels. For all the
copolymerized gels, lesser values of storage and loss modulus have
been observed than for the pure CMC and xylan gels. We have further
calculated the loss tangent values of the hydrogels and plotted in Figure 8 as a log–log
plot with respect to the frequency. At higher frequencies (>10
Hz),
the loss tangent becomes greater than unity, that is, a phase transition
occurs. After the phase transition, the cross-linked structure breaks
down, and thereafter the liquid-like behavior of the gels is confirmed.

Figure 8 Loss tangent
of hydrogels.

Figure 9a represents
the temperature sweep measurement of the precursors of hydrogels within
25–80 °C, with 1 °C min–1 increment
of temperature, 1 Hz frequency, and 1% of strain. The gelation point,
gelation temperature, and gelation time of all the hydrogels are given
in Table 2. We observe
that the viscous nature of the precursors dominates until the gelation
temperature. The gelation temperature of all gels is observed within
317–324 K (43–51 °C). After the gelation temperature,
elastic nature is seen to be prominent, that is, the evolution of
network. During the evolution of network, a sharp rise in the storage
and loss moduli is observed. The formation of the network is completed
within 317–330 K (43–57 °C). The similar temperature
range is also observed during the synthesis of the hydrogels. Among
the five hydrogels, the XC50 gel has the narrowest temperature range
for the network evolution. For this, 1:1 molar ratio is concluded
as an ideal mixture to form the cellulose–hemicellulose hydrogel.
After gelation, the network stabilizes, and no new crossover is observed.
This implies that the stability of the network is up to 80 °C
at LVR. Figure 9b represents
the time sweep measurements of the precursor solutions measured at
the corresponding gelation temperatures with 1 Hz frequency and 1%
of strain. Like temperature sweep, the viscous nature of the precursor
dominates until the crossover point. The crossover point for every
hydrogel appears within 5–11 min, signifying the relative slow
nature of gelation after the addition of the cross-linker. However,
once it starts, the whole network is built up within 5–7 min,
and sharp changes in the storage and loss moduli are observed. Among
the five gels, XC50 provided the fastest gelation time of 5 min. After
the evolution of network, the network remains stable for a long duration,
which reflects its strong network formation and also confirms the
elastic behavior when compared to the viscous behavior.

3.4 Swelling Ratio and Gel
Fraction
Figure 10a represents the
SR of hydrogels measured in DI water, AGF, AIF, and PBS buffers. Both
CMC and xylan are linear polymers which create network gels by cross-linking.
The dominant charge species of polysaccharides, that is, the hydroxyl
moiety (in CMC and xylan) and carboxymethyl moiety (in CMC) repel
each other and expand the network structure in a suitable medium.
The SR is determined by the amount of water absorbed to the dry weight
of the hydrogel. Here, the order of swelling is CMC gel > XC25
> XC50 >
XC75 > xylan gel. The long-chain carboxymethyl moieties electrostatically
repel each other; therefore the SR increases with the increment of
the molar ratio of CMC in the hydrogel. Further, for all hydrogels,
a greater swelling is observed in DI water. For buffers, the available
free ions readily bind with the deprotonated hydroxyl and carboxymethyl
moieties and hinder swelling. For this, least SR is observed in the
AGF buffer. For all the hydrogels, the trend of SR observed in all
buffers and DI water is: DI water > PBS > AIF > AGF. Figure 10b represents the
gel fraction
of the hydrogels. The gel fraction follows the trend: CMC gel <
XC25 < XC50 < XC75 < xylan gel. As the gel fraction increases,
the degree of cross-linking in the network increases. Therefore, the
network has a less flexibility to swell and absorb more water. For
this, the gel fraction follows the opposite trend of SR.30

3.5 Loading
of VB12
Figure 11 represents the
VB12 loading in the hydrogels. The CMC gel and xylan gel
have 15.46 and 17.75% VB12 loading, respectively, whereas
the copolymerized gels have greater than 20% loading. XC50 has the
highest VB12 loading of 36.59% among the copolymerized
gels. The recorded loading is higher than that reported by Bajpai
and Dubey20 and Xu et al.31 It is presumed that the porous structures of the copolymerized
gels adsorb higher amounts of vitamin than the surface adsorption
by pure CMC and xylan gels.

3.6 In Vitro
Release of VB12
The in vitro release of VB12 from the hydrogel network
in AGF, AIF, and PBS buffers is shown in Figure 12a–c. AGF mimics the stomach fluid,
whereas AIF mimics the first zone of intestinal fluid.32 The pH of the colonic fluid is 7.4 which is
adequately represented by PBS.33 Thus,
the in vitro release of VB12 in these buffers will elucidate
the vitamin release behavior in simulated physiological fluids. Further, Figure 12d represents the
in vitro release of VB12 in consecutive buffers. The mean
gastric emptying time is 1.08 h (±0.11 h) and the mean colonic
arrival time is 2.83 h (±0.33 h), which reflect the transit time
through the small intestine as 1.75 h (±0.25 h).34 Therefore, the residence time of 2 h in the gastric fluid,
that is, AGF, 2 h in the intestinal fluid, that is, AIF, and 6 h in
the colonic fluid, that is, PBS would be a realistic effort to simulate
the in vitro release of VB12 in the gastrointestinal tract.33

Figure 12 In vitro release of VB12 in physiological buffers:
(a)
AGF buffer, (b) AIF buffer, (c) PBS buffer, and (d) AGF–AIF–PBS
buffer.

It is observed from Figure 12a–c that
the in vitro release of VB12 depends on the pH of the medium.
A cumulative release of less than
28% is observed in AGF compared to 80–88% in AIF and 93–98%
in PBS. The release of guest molecules (here VB12) from
the hydrogels depends on the available ions in the buffer as well
as the swelling nature of the hydrogels. The swelling of the hydrogels
occurs because of the repulsion of the charged moieties which allow
them to move away from each other, resulting in the loosening of the
matrix, thereby allowing the diffusion of water. However, a lower
swelling is observed if the negatively charged hydroxyl and carboxyl
moieties are quickly protonated. Therefore, for AGF, higher amounts
of the available H+ ions quickly occupy the unprotonated
sites and thus block the electrostatic repulsion and in turn lower
the released amount of VB12. The CMC and xylan gels release
19.05 and 19.27% VB12, respectively, in the AGF buffer
after 8 h, whereas the copolymerized gels release within 24–28%.
A flat plateau is observed for all the release profiles in AGF, which
reflects the tightly bound VB12 cannot be released in AGF.
Only the loosely bound VB12 is released in AGF. In AIF
and PBS, we observe an initial burst release of VB12 (Figure 12b,c). The burst
release is attributed to the swelling behavior of the gels and dominates
for the first 2 h for all gels. However, after the initial burst,
we observe a slow and gradual release of VB12. During this
time, the ions of the respective buffers bind with the hydroxyl moieties,
facilitating the release of VB12 into the medium. From Figure 12d, we observe a
similar amount of VB12 release in AGF in first 2 h as compared
to VB12 release in AGF only (Figure 12a). However, the burst releases
in AIF and PBS are not observed here as the unprotonated moieties
are already been occupied with H+ ions from AGF. The release
of VB12 will mainly depend on the available ions of the
AIF and PBS buffers. Therefore, we observe that a significant amount
of VB12 has been delivered in PBS, that is, the hydrogels
are capable to release VB12 in the colon. Further, the
hydrogels are also able to deliver VB12 for a longer duration
of 10 h if they are first exposed to AGF.

The in vitro release
study in the different physiological buffers
also defines the efficiency of hydrogels as effective carriers of
VB12. In all release media, the XC50 hydrogel is proven
to facilitate te highest cumulative release as compared to the other
gels. Although the CMC and xylan gels produce the highest and lowest
SRs in all buffers, respectively, the cumulative release is lower
than that of the copolymerized gels. This indicates that the mere
diffusion of water and the resulting relaxation of cross-linking are
not the prime factors for the delivery of VB12. The copolymeric
gels have porous morphology as observed from FESEM, providing the
ideal binding sites for VB12 both at the surface as well
as inside the pores. Further, these gels have a higher gelation point,
that is, they can withstand a high deformation strain than the pure
CMC and xylan gels. Thus, they can better hold the cross-linked structure.
Further, for longer duration, the VB12 molecules can be
attached to the binding sites.

3.7 Comparison
of In Vitro Release of VB12 with the Literature
The in vitro release of VB12 from the hydrogels in physiological
buffers is then compared with
the previously reported two CMC-based hydrogels and one xylan-based
hydrogel. The summary of comparison is given in Table 3. Boruah et al. reported a less than 35%
cumulative release of VB12 in pH 1.2 and less than 55%
cumulative release of VB12 in pH 7.4 after 10 h using CMC-grafted
poly(acrylic acid) and organophilic montmorillonite nanoclay composite
hydrogel.22 However, the cumulative release
increases to 76.2% after 10 h using a lower amount of cross-linker
in DI water at room temperature. Nath and Dolui reported VB12-loaded CMC-grafted poly(acrylic acid) and LDH hydrogel.23 The hydrogel released 66% VB12 in
pH 7.4 and 50% in pH 1.2 in 6 h. They further reported that the VB12-loaded hydrogel without LDH was seen to release a total
of 45% in pH 1.2 and 59% in pH 7.4 after 6 h. Cao et al. also reported
the in vitro release of VB12 from multiresponsive xylan
hydrogels in pH 2.2 and 7.4 at 37 °C for a period of 7 h.24 A cumulative release of 78.3% in acidic medium
and 89.3% in alkaline medium without UV irradiation has been reported,
whereas a higher amount of VB12 has been released in alkaline
medium in the presence of UV. Compared to the previous reports, the
CMC–xylan copolymerized hydrogels of this work have a higher
delivery capacity in AIF and PBS, respectively, for a longer duration.
However, a lesser amount of VB12 is delivered in the AGF
medium. Unlike the previous reports, we have studied the delivery
of VB12 in the consecutive physiological buffers of the
gastrointestinal tract. Overall, the hydrogels are capable of delivering
VB12 greater than 90% for 10 h.

4 Conclusions
EGDE-cross-linked CMC- and xylan-based homopolymerized
hydrogels
as well as copolymerized CMC–xylan-based gels are synthesized
in an alkaline medium. Among the five gels, the CMC gel
possesses the highest SR, and the xylan gel has the least SR in AGF,
AIF, PBS buffer, and DI water. The SR of the CMC gel is 146.58% in
AGF buffer which steadily increases to 659.34% in DI water. However,
the gel fraction follows the opposite trend of SR, that is, a highest
gel fraction of 98.63% is obtained with the xylan gel, whereas the
CMC gel produces 85.64% gel fraction. The morphologies of the CMC
and xylan gels appear to be coarse in nature, whereas the copolymerized
CMC–xylan gels are porous in nature. All five hydrogels produce
a shear-thinning behavior upon increasing the rate up to 1000 s–1. Further, the CMC–xylan gel (1:1 molar ratio)
gave a longer gel point than the CMC gel and xylan gel. The longer
gel point proves that the copolymerized structure can withstand more
stress than pure hydrogels. Further, the loss tangent values are less
than unity until the gel point, signifying the elastic nature of the
hydrogels which dominates over the viscous nature. The dominance of
the elastic nature concludes the successful cross-linking with EGDE,
whereby the hydrogels can relax the cross-linking structure up to
the gel point with an influence of the external stimuli. The CMC–xylan
gel (1:1 molar ratio) has the least gelation temperature of 317 K,
and the gelation process starts after 5 min. After gelation, a stable
hydrogel network is observed up to 80 °C. This hydrogel is further
proved to have a higher VB12 loading of 36.59%. Further,
the copolymerized gels release 24–28% VB12 in AGF,
82–88% in AIF, and 96–98% in PBS, which are higher than
that of the homopolymerized gels. The in vitro release profile reflects
the initial burst release of VB12 followed by the steady
release up to 8 h.
