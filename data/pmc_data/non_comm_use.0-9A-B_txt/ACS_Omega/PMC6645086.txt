This
study is an attempt to develop a theoretical methodology to
elucidate or predict the structural characteristics and the physical
properties of an isolated polymeric chain and its crystalline state
precisely and quantitatively. To be more specific, conformational
characteristics of a biobased and biodegradable polyamide, nylon 4,
in the free state have been revealed by not only ab initio molecular
orbital calculations on its model compound but also nuclear magnetic
resonance experiments for the model and nylon 4. Furthermore, the
crystal structure and solid-state properties of nylon 4 have been
elucidated by density functional theory calculations with a dispersion
force correction under periodic boundary conditions. In the free state,
the nylon 4 chain forms intramolecular N–H···O=C
hydrogen bonds, which force the polymeric chain into distorted conformations
including a number of gauche bonds, whereas nylon 4 crystallizes in
the fully extended all-trans structure (α form) that is stabilized
by intermolecular N–H···O=C hydrogen
bonds. The intermolecular interaction energy (ΔECP) in the crystal was accurately calculated via a counterpoise
(CP) method contrived here to correct the basis set superposition
error, and the ultimate crystalline modulus (Eb) in the chain axis (b axis)
direction at 0 K was also evaluated theoretically. The results were
compared with those obtained from the α and γ crystalline
forms of nylon 6, and, consequently, the superiority of nylon 4 to
nylon 6 in thermal stability and mechanical properties was indicated:
the ΔECP and Eb values are, respectively, −214 cal
g–1 and 334 GPa (nylon 4), −191 cal g–1 and 316 GPa (α form of nylon 6), and −184
cal g–1 and 120 GPa (γ form of nylon 6). In
conclusion, nylon 4 is expected to be put to practical use as a tough
environmentally friendly polyamide.

Introduction
In order to suppress
global warming, we are increasingly required
to replace chemical production based on fossil resources with manufacture
from carbon-neutral feedstock. Nylon 6 is produced by ring-opening
polymerization of ϵ-caprolactam,1 and its monomeric unit includes six carbon atoms originating from
the starting material, benzene, phenol, cyclohexane, or 1-cyclohexanol.
If the carbon sources were produced from plants, nylon 6 would become
a carbon-neutral material. Nylon 6 was suggested to be degraded by
a white rot fungi strain IZU-154, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and Trametes versicolor through
oxidation processes;2,3 however, the degradation is so
slow that nylon 6 is far from biodegradable.

Nylon 4 is produced
from 2-pyrrolidone, which has recently come
to be prepared by fermentation of biomass using Escherichia
coli from biobased γ-glutamic acid via γ-aminobutyric
acid;4 therefore, nylon 4 can be considered
to be biobased and carbon-neutral. Furthermore, it was found that
nylon 4 is hydrolyzed to γ-aminobutyric acid by Pseudomonas sp. ND-11 widely inhabiting activated
sludge and finally decomposed into CO2, H2O,
and NO3–.5−10 Besides, this polyamide is degraded in vivo.11

Nylon 6 is superior in mechanical strength, rigidity,
thermal stability,
and chemical residence.12 These favorable
properties are partly due to interchain N–H···O=C
hydrogen bonds. Nylon 4 also forms so strong interchain hydrogen bonds
as to exhibit melting points of 260–265 °C higher than
that (225 °C) of nylon 6.12−14 This means that, compared with
nylon 6, nylon 4 has an advantage of superior thermal resistance and
a disadvantage of higher energy costs in annealing and molding processes.
Despite the drawback, nylon 4 is expected to become a biobased and
biodegradable substitute for nylon 6.

In expectation of future
utilization of nylon 4, we have elucidated
its structural characteristics and physical properties by computational
chemistry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments as follows:
(chain characteristics) conformational analysis via molecular orbital
(MO) calculations and NMR experiments on its small model compound, N-acetyl-γ-aminobutyric acid N′-methylamide
(designated herein as ABAMA, Figure 1) and nylon 4; (crystal structure and properties) density
functional theory (DFT) calculations on the α crystalline form
of nylon 4 under periodic boundary conditions to optimize the crystal
structure, evaluate the interchain interaction energy via correction
for the basis set superposition error (BSSE), and calculate the crystalline
moduli. The solid-state properties of the α and γ forms
of nylon 6 were also evaluated in a similar manner to be compared
with those of nylon 4.

of carbon atoms (α, β, and ω) of nylon 4 and hydrogen
atoms (A, B, B′, C, C′, D, and D′) and bond numbers
(1–8) of ABAMA. (c) Nylon 6.

Herein, we describe details of the theoretical and experimental
methods, elucidate conformational characteristics, crystalline structure,
and properties of nylon 4, discuss the superiority of nylon 4 to nylon
6 in some physical properties, and finally conclude that nylon 4 will
be put to practical use as a tough environmentally friendly material.

Results
and Discussion
MO Calculations
It is well established
that small model
compounds with the same bond sequence as that of a given polymer can
represent conformational characteristics of the polymer;15 therefore, we have usually employed such model
compounds instead of polymers themselves. Here, we have adopted ABAMA
as a model for nylon 4.

As for the molecular geometry of ABAMA,
the following assumptions may be allowed: the C(=O)–NH
atoms lie on a plane, the C–N bond is not rotatable, and the
methyl terminal has a C3 symmetry. Therefore,
only internal rotations around bonds 3–6 have been considered
here (Figure 1), and
hence 81 (=34) staggered conformers (trans, gauche+, and gauche–) may be possible under the
rotational isomeric state (RIS) approximation. However, inasmuch as
the all-trans form of ABAMA has a Cs symmetry, the g+ and g– conformations
of each bond are equivalent in energy, and hence the number of its
independent conformers is reduced to 41. Although the 41 conformers
underwent the geometrical optimization at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level, only 15 conformers reached the local energy minimum (Table 1). Not all dihedral
angles of the 15 conformers stay within the standard values of well-defined
rotamers such as trans, gauche, and cis conformations. Dihedral angles
of the CH2–C(=O) bond (bond 6) in particular
are distributed widely and those of the HN–CH2 bond
(bond 3) are also scattered, whereas those of bonds 4 and 5 are found
to be normal. In the γ crystal of nylon 6, the adjacent bonds
of the amide group adopt a skew conformation.16 In fact, the B3LYP optimization with a dispersion force correction
(abbreviated as B3LYP-D) for the γ form rendered dihedral angles
of the HN–CH2 and CH2–C(=O)
bonds ±111.8° and ∓117.5°, respectively. Therefore,
these two bonds of aliphatic polyamides seem to be readily variable,
and their rotational flexibility allows the polyamides to lie in the
γ form. In the α form, the interchain hydrogen bonds are
suggested to be more efficient than in the γ form, whereas,
in the γ form, the optimum packing of the methylene units appears
to dominate over the hydrogen bond.17 Therefore,
nylons 4 and 6 prefer the α form, whereas nylons n (n ≥ 8) show the γ preference.

a The dihedral angle is defined here
according to the IUPAC recommendation:18 trans (t) ≈ 180 ± Δ°; gauche+ (g+) ≈ −60 ± Δ°; gauche– (g–) ≈ +60 ± Δ°, where
Δ stands for the allowance.

b The dihedral angles of bond 6 are
distributed too widely to be classified into a few RISs.

c At the MP2/6-311+G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level. Relative to ΔGk of the all-trans conformation.

d For the bond numbers, see Figure 1.

e Dimethyl sulfoxide.

f The
molecular geometry was optimized
with the dihedral angles fixed at 180° so that the all-trans
conformation would be the control for ΔGk and 13C NMR chemical shifts.

Figure 2 illustrates
some conformations with low ΔGk values, showing the formation of N–H···O=C
close contacts, that is, intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Here, ΔGk represents the free energy
difference of conformer k from that of the all-trans
form. For the conformer number k, see Table 1. The ΔGk values including solvation of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol
(TFE) and H···O distances were evaluated to be, respectively,
−3.92 kcal mol–1 and 2.00 Å (k = 15), −3.59 kcal mol–1 and 1.94
Å (k = 3), and −2.95 kcal mol–1 and 2.65 Å (k = 14). Therefore, it is obvious
that the low ΔGk’s are due to the intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

Figure 2 Stable conformers
of ABAMA with the electrostatic potential surface:
(a) k = 15, g+g–g–(∼g+); (b) k = 3,
tg+g–(∼t); (c) k = 14, g+g–g+(∼t). k is the conformer number (see Table 1), and approximate conformations of bond
6 are written within parentheses. The dotted lines represent intramolecular
N–H···O=C hydrogen bonds.

The trans fractions (pt’s) of
bonds 3–5 were calculated with the ΔGk data according to the conformational
classification shown in Table 1. All the pt values (see Table 3) are so small as
to indicate that ABAMA strongly prefers distorted shapes rich in gauche
conformations (Figure 2). Because the pt values tend to increase
with medium polarity, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds would be weakened
or cleaved by the polar solvents.

Figure 3 shows the 1H NMR spectra observed
from three kinds of methylene protons, BB′, CC′, and
DD′ (see Figure 1), of ABAMA and nylon 4. The gNMR simulations19 for ABAMA exactly reproduced the observed spectra to yield
the chemical shits and spin–spin coupling constants. Of the
NMR parameters, only vicinal coupling constants, used in the conformational
analysis, are listed in Table 2.

CC′, and DD′, for the proton designations, see Figure 1): (a) ABAMA dissolved
in chloroform-d at 45 °C; (b) ABAMA in TFE at
25 °C; (c) nylon 4 in TFE at 25 °C. The number-average and
weight-average molecular weights of the nylon 4 sample were determined
to be 10.3 and 67.7 kDa, respectively. The molecular weight distribution
is shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

The vicinal 1H–1H coupling constant
(3JXY) between protons X and
Y can be expressed as a function of trans (pt) and gauche (pg) fractions of
the centrally intervening bond as follows: between protons A and B
(B′) about bond 3 1  between protons B (B′)
and C (C′)
about bond 4 2  and 3  between protons C (C′)
and D (D′)
about bond 5 4  and 5  

By definition, the
following relation must always be fulfilled: 6  

The proton symbols and bond numbers
are defined in Figure 1. The coefficients (JC’s JE′, JG’s, and JT’s) of
the individual equations, illustrated in Figure 4, were obtained as follows: (set A) from
the Karplus equation for the same bond sequence as that of ABAMA;
(sets B, D, and F) from MO calculations for ABAMA itself at the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd)//B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)
level; (sets C and E) from experimental coupling constants of a ring
compound, 2-methylpiperidine or cyclohexane, which has a bond sequence
similar to that of ABAMA. The numerical values of the coefficients
are written in the footnotes of Table 3. Substitution of
the observed 3JXY values into
the above equations yields pt’s
and pg’s of the individual bonds,
and only the pt values are listed in Table 3 because of eq 6.

g Not available because the corresponding
vicinal coupling constant was not observed.

Compared with the pt’s
derived
from the MO calculations, those of sets D and F are somewhat larger,
whereas those of sets A, B, C, and E show good agreement with the
theoretical values (Table 3); in general, the agreement seems to be fully acceptable.
As discussed above, the MO calculations suggest that the small pt values result from the intramolecular N–H···O=C
hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the NMR data also indicate formation of
the hydrogen bonds in the solutions.

Inasmuch as both MO and
NMR data here suggest that ABAMA forms
the strong intramolecular N–H···O=C hydrogen
bond, it is probable that the isolated nylon 4 chain also includes
the hydrogen bonding. To prove this conjecture, we measured the 1H NMR spectra of nylon 4 itself and attempted to reproduce
the observed spectra using the same geminal and vicinal coupling constants
as derived from ABAMA. In Figure 3c, as an example, the measured and calculated spectra
of nylon 4 in TFE at 25 °C are compared. It can be seen that
both spectra are essentially identical. This fact indicates that nylon
4 has the 3JXY and pt values (i.e., conformational distribution)
close to those of ABAMA and hence supports the abovementioned conjecture.
All spectra observed from nylon 4 dissolved in TFE at different temperatures
were reproduced exactly.

13C NMR Chemical Shifts
Ando et al.23 measured solid-state 13C NMR of nylon
4 via the cross-polarization/magic-angle spinning (MAS), 13C pulse saturation transfer/MAS, and 13C low-power decoupling/MAS
techniques, determined the 13C chemical shifts of the crystalline
and noncrystalline chains separately, and plotted the chemical shift
differences (Δδi’s, i, carbon species) between the crystalline and amorphous
carbons against the carbon position as shown in Figure 5. The 13C chemical shift differences
of nylon 4 between in the crystallite and in a 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol
(HFIP) solution were also investigated. As seen from Figure 5, both Δδi values depend largely on the carbon position in
the backbone, and the two plots (open triangle and square) oscillate
similarly. It was suggested that the experimental data would be interpreted
in terms of the so-called γ and δ substituent effects.
The former and latter effects stem from the shielding or deshielding
caused by chemical species (atoms) separated from the observed carbon
atom by three and four bonds, respectively, thus depending on conformations
of the in-between bonds.24 On the basis
of these effects, conformational analyses of polymers have been carried
out:25,26 the δ and γ effect parameters
are appropriately assumed and weight-averaged over the possible conformations
to yield 13C chemical shifts, which are compared with the
corresponding experimental values.27,28 However, it
is too difficult to carry out conformational analysis of nylon 4 and
ABAMA in this manner, because, as discussed above, dihedral angles
of bonds 3 and 6 are variable to a large extent; therefore, it is
impossible to simulate the 13C chemical shifts with a small
number of δ and γ effect parameters.

shift differences of ABAMA and nylon
4: (●) ABAMA in the gas phase, from eq 8; (▲) ABAMA in TFE, from eq 8; (△) nylon 4 in the amorphous
phase, from Δδi = δcrystallinei – δamorphousi;23 (□) nylon 4 in the HFIP solution, from Δδi = δcrystallinei – δsolutioni.23i indicates
the carbon species (C=O, αCH2, βCH2, and ωCH2, see Figure 1a).

Instead, we calculated the chemical
shift differences (Δδi’s)
of ABAMA between in the all-trans
conformation and in the free state. The chemical shift ⟨δi⟩ of carbon i of
ABAMA in the free state can be calculated as the weight average over
all the possible conformations 7  where δki is
the 13C chemical shift of carbon i of
conformer k, ΔGk is given in Table 1, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The calculated δki and ⟨δi⟩ values are listed in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The Δδi value of ABAMA is defined as the difference from that (δall-transi) of the all-trans state 8  

The Δδi values, calculated
from the δki and ΔGk data on the gas phase (filled circle)
and TFE solution (filled triangle), are plotted in Figure 5. Because nylon 4 crystallizes
in the all-trans conformation, it is meaningful to compare the Δδi values between ABAMA and nylon 4. Figure 5 clearly shows that
the Δδi plots of ABAMA oscillate
analogously to the data of Ando et al.23 on nylon 4. This fact indicates that the model and polymer undergo
similar γ and δ effects and hence have analogous conformational
distributions. As shown above, ABAMA strongly prefers the bent conformations
because of the intramolecular N–H···O=C
hydrogen bonds (Figure 2); therefore, the nylon 4 chain also lies in such distorted conformations
in the free state (viz., melt, amorphous phase, and solutions). Both
vicinal 1H–1H coupling constants and 13C chemical shifts show that the free nylon 4 chain tends
to form the intramolecular hydrogen bonds.

This conclusion is
also based on Flory’s assertion:29−31 in the statistical thermodynamics
of polymer systems, the partition
function of polymer solutions can be factorable into intra- and intermolecular
parts, and each is independent of the other. The latter factor depends
on the composition, whereas the former is unaffected by dilution.
It follows immediately that the configuration of the chain should
be unperturbed (as if it were dissolved in a theta solvent) even in
the amorphous and molten states with other chains at a high density.
Configurational properties of polymers in the unperturbed state will
be influenced only by short-range intramolecular interactions.15 In fact, for example, the spatial configuration
of nylon 6,6 with hydrogen bonds was predicted under the RIS scheme
based on intramolecular interactions within the monomeric unit,32 being in good agreement with the experiment.33 Flory’s assertion has been demonstrated
by small-angle neutron-scattering experiments.31,34

Structure of the α Crystalline Form of Nylon 4, Optimized
by the B3LYP-D Calculation
The lattice constants optimized
at the B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p) level are as follows: α form of nylon
4, a = 9.50 (9.29) Å, b = 12.36
(12.24) Å, c = 7.39 (7.97) Å, β =
111.6° (114.5°); α form of nylon 6, a = 9.56 (9.56) Å, b = 17.48 (17.24) Å, c = 7.48 (8.01) Å, β = 68.0° (67.5°);
γ form of nylon 6, a = 8.89 (9.33) Å, b = 16.96 (16.88) Å, c = 4.80 (4.78)
Å, β = 125.4° (121°). Here, the experimental
data are written in the parentheses.16,35,36 The agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory.
Milani et al.37 also optimized the α
and γ structures of nylon 6 at the same level and derived slightly
different lattice constants from ours; however, the discrepancies
may stay within allowances of the structural optimization. Figure 6 shows the optimized
crystal cell of the α form of nylon 4. For the optimized fractional
coordinates, see Table S2 (Supporting Information). The calculated and experimental Cartesian coordinates (in Å)
of the atoms are compared in Table S3 (Supporting Information). The mean difference (⟨Δ⟩)
between the optimized and experimental Cartesian coordinates was calculated
from 9  to be
0.341 Å, where Nat is the total number
of atoms in the unit cell and,
for example, xcal,i and xexp,i represent the calculated
and experimental x positions of the i-th atom, respectively. In Table S4 (Supporting Information), the structure factors for X-ray diffraction are
listed. The reliability factor, R 10  was obtained as 0.253. Here, Fobs and Fcalc are the observed
and calculated structure factors, respectively. The original analysis
of the crystal structure by Fredericks et al.35 resulted in R = 0.273. Thus, the present DFT-D
calculations yielded somewhat better agreement with the observation.

level (R = 0.253 defined in eq 10): (above) top and (below) side views. The
hydrogen bond geometry (N–H···O=C, dotted
lines) of nylon 4 was calculated by the PLATON program:38 N–H = 1.02 Å; H···O
= 1.81 Å; N···O = 2.819 Å; N–H···O
= 168°. The crystalline moduli in the a, b (chain axis), and c axis directions were
evaluated to be 53.6, 334, and 16.8 GPa, respectively.

Intermolecular Interaction Energies of Crystals
of Nylons 4
and 6
The intermolecular interaction energy (ΔE) between molecules A and B may be simply estimated from 11  where EAB{AB} is
the energy of the complex of molecules A and B, calculated with basis
sets {AB} of both molecules, and EA{A} (EB{B}) is the energy of molecule A
(B) calculated with the basis set {A} ({B}). However, it is well known
that the ΔE value includes the so-called BSSE.
To eliminate the BSSE, the counterpoise (CP) method has often been
employed;39,40 on this basis, the interaction energy (ΔECP) is derived from 12  Here, for example, EA{AB} is the energy of molecule A, calculated with basis sets
{AB}; molecule B supplies only its basis set and hence is termed ghost. Therefore, the BSSE may be estimated from 13  

For three-dimensional
crystals in which
polymeric chains of innite length are packed densely, we have devised
a suitable CP method (Figure 7). The BSSE per repeating unit may be dened as 14  where ESC{Domain}(ng) is the energy of a single chain
(SC) located in a domain filled with the ng ghost chains, and ESC{SC} is the energy
of the single isolated chain. Both ESC{Domain}(ng) and ESC{SC} can be calculated under the one-dimensional periodic boundary condition
(in the chain axis direction). Therefore, the interaction energy per
repeating unit, based on the CP method, can be calculated from 15  where ECrystal is the total energy of
the crystal including Z repeating
unit, and ESC{SC}+D is the SC energy with
the dispersion force correction. The ESC{Domain}(ng), ESC{SC}, and ESC{SC}+D terms are evaluated per
repeating unit. In principle, the ΔECP(ng) value must become more reliable
(freer from the BSSE) with increasing domain size, that is, the number
(ng) of ghost chains (see Figure 7). Ultimately, the most reliable
BSSE can be derived from 16  

Figure 7 Schematic
illustration of the CP method proposed herein to correct
the BSSE of polymer crystals: (above) side and (below) top views.
(a) Target chain of infinite length. (b–d) Target chain surrounded
by ghost chains of infinite length. As the number (ng) of ghost chains increases (from b to d), the BSSE would
approach a certain value, BSSE(∞) (see Figure 8).

From BSSE(∞), we can obtain the ideal interaction
energy,
ΔECP(∞). In this study, the ESC{Domain} and ESC{SC} energies were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) and B3LYP/pob_TZVP
levels, and the ECrystal and ESC{SC}+D energies were evaluated at the same levels with
the dispersion force correction (B3LYP-D/6-31G(d,p) and B3LYP-D/pob_TZVP).

Figure 8 shows the BSSE (ng) versus ng plot for the α form of nylon 4, in which
the magnitude of BSSE (ng) increases with ng and finally converges on a horizontal line:
BSSE(∞) = −6.06 kcal mol–1 (B3LYP/6-31G(d,p))
or −5.24 kcal mol–1 (B3LYP/pob_TZVP). The
ΔECP(∞) energy was derived
from the BSSE(∞) with eq 15 as shown in Table 4. For more detailed numerical data, see Table S5 (Supporting Information). Similarly, the ΔECP(∞) energies of nylon 6 were evaluated.
Because nylon 4 is different from nylon 6 in monomer size, the ΔECP(∞) value was recalculated in two units:
kcal per mol of the skeletal bond; cal g–1. The
scaled values suggest that nylon 4 would be more thermally stable
than nylon 6. Actually, the melting point of nylon 4 has been observed
in the range of 260–265 °C,13 whereas the equilibrium melting point (Tm0) of nylon 6 was
determined to be 225 °C.14 However,
it should be noted that the ΔECP(∞) value at 0 K derived here is a measure of thermal stability,
because, strictly, Tm0 = ΔHu/ΔSu, where ΔHu and ΔSu are the enthalpy and entropy
of fusion, respectively.14

Figure 8 BSSE of the α form
of nylon 4 as a function of the number
(ng) of ghost chains. As ng increase, the BSSEs at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) (filled
circle) and B3LYP/pob_TZVP (filled square) levels approach −6.06
and −5.24 kcal mol–1 (horizontal dotted lines),
respectively. A function of A + B exp(−ng/C) (dotted
curve) was fitted to the calculated data, where A, B, and C are adjustable parameters
and A corresponds to BSSE(∞).

It is known that, for
nylon 6, the α form is more thermodynamically
stable than the γ form.16,17,37,41,42 The energy difference (Eα–γ = Eα – Eγ) between the two crystalline forms, corrected
for the BSSE by our CP method, is 0.09 kcal mol–1 (6-31G(d,p)) or −0.59 kcal mol–1 (pob_TZVP),
and other studies17,41,42 have also calculated the Eα–γ values of nylon 6 to be −0.29, −0.323, and −0.50
kcal mol–1.

Crystal Elasticity
As for polymers, mechanical properties
may be the most important characteristics especially from a practical
point of view. Inasmuch as semicrystalline polymers comprise crystalline
and amorphous regions, the crystalline modulus in the chain axis direction
at 0 K is, in principle, the largest modulus that the polymer can
exhibit.43 Shown in Appendix A (Supporting Information) are the stiffness and
compliance tensors calculated for the α form of nylon 4 and
the α and γ forms of nylon 6. The compliance tensor yields
Young’s moduli (Ea, Eb, and Ec, respectively) in the a, b (chain axis), and c axis directions
of the crystal. In Table 5, the calculated crystalline moduli at 0 K are compared with
other theoretical and experimental data. Most of the experimental
values were determined from X-ray diffraction measurements at room
temperature. Therefore, it is natural that the crystalline moduli
calculated here are larger than the experimental values, because the
crystalline modulus depends on the temperature (cf. Eb’s (100 and 270 GPa) of the α
form of nylon 6 at 18 and −150 °C, respectively, Miyasaka,
1980).44 Interestingly, other theoretical
data are, in general, similar to our calculations. Among the three
crystalline forms, the magnitude relation of Eb can be expressed as α of nylon 4 >
α of nylon 6 ≫ γ of nylon 6, and the modulus in
the hydrogen bond direction is also in the order of α of nylon
4 (Ea) > α of
nylon
6 (Ea) > γ of
nylon
6 (∼Ec). In the
α form, the hydrogen bond forms nearly in the a axis direction (see Figure 6), whereas, in the c axis direction, only
van der Waals interactions exist; therefore, Ea is expected to be larger than Ec, as the present calculations indicate.

Conclusions
The MO calculations
on the model compound, ABAMA, well reproduced
not only the bond conformations determined from NMR vicinal 1H–1H coupling constants but also the conformational
dependence of 13C NMR chemical shifts of nylon 4 existing
in the amorphous and solution environments. These facts show that
the nylon 4 chain in itself tends to lie in distorted conformations
rich in gauche states because of intramolecular N–H···O=C
hydrogen bonds. The DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level
including the dispersion force correction under the three-dimensional
periodic boundary condition reproduced the experimental crystal structures
of nylons 4 and 6. A CP method for correcting the BSSE of polymer
crystals has been devised and applied to the three crystalline forms
to yield the following interaction energies: −214 cal g–1 (α form of nylon 4); −191 cal g–1 (α form of nylon 6); and −184 cal g–1 (γ form of nylon 6). Therefore, nylon 4 is
suggested to be more thermally stable than nylon 6. The B3LYP-D calculations
also yielded the crystalline moduli parallel to the crystalline a, b, and c axes. As the
maximum stiffness, Young’s moduli in the chain axis (b axis) direction of the crystals at 0 K were predicted:
334 GPa (α form of nylon 4); 316 GPa (α form of nylon
6); and 120 GPa (γ form of nylon 6). These data suggest that
nylon 4 is also superior to nylon 6 in stiffness. Because of the potential
carbon neutrality and biodegradability, nylon 4 will be used for strong
environmentally friendly materials and, probably, also biomedical
materials left in human bodies, such as sutures for surgery, whereas
its biodegradability would be disadvantageous for the use of durable
materials kept long in the environment, for example, fishing lines
and nets. In conclusion, nylon 4 will be partly substituted for nylon
6 and open up the possibility of new functional materials. The computational
characterization developed here can also be applied to other polymers,
furthermore, for molecular design of new polymers.

Methods
Materials
Synthesis
of Model Compound, ABAMA
The model compound,
ABAMA, was, in principle, prepared by reference to previous studies.52,53 Aqueous solution of methylamine (40%, 40 mL) was added to ethyl
4-aminobutyrate hydrochloride (2.5 g, 15 mmol), stirred at 0 °C
for 15 min, and then condensed on a rotary evaporator. The residue
was dissolved in a small amount of methanol and added dropwise to
petroleum ether to yield a white precipitate. The precipitate was
collected by filtration, dissolved in methanol, and dropped into tetrahydrofuran
including 7% methylamine to separate out a white solid. After removal
of the precipitate, the filtrate was condensed and dried under reduced
pressure to yield a yellow oily product, which was identified as γ-aminobutyric
acid N-methylamide by 1H and 13C NMR (yield, 26%).

1H NMR (400 MHz, (CD3)2SO, δ): 1.53 (quin, 2H, CH2CH2CH2), 2.05 (t, 2H, CH2CH2C=O), 2.47 (t, 2H, NH2CH2), 2.54 (d, 3H, NHCH3), 2.9 (br s 2H, NH2), 7.71
(s, 1H, NHC=O); 13C NMR ((CD3)2SO, δ): 25.4, 29.5, 33.0, 41.3, 172.6.

Dry pyridine (0.87 mL, 11 mmol) was added to dry chloroform (10
mL) including the γ-aminobutyric acid N-methylamide
(0.44 g, 3.8 mmol) prepared as above. With the solution stirred at
0 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, acetyl chloride (0.57 mL, 8.0
mmol) was added slowly. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature
and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture underwent extraction with
0.1 M hydrochloric acid and 5 wt % NaHCO3 aqueous solution.
After the water layer was condensed, the residue was dissolved in
a small amount of methanol and added dropwise to tetrahydrofuran including
7% methylamine to yield a white precipitate. After filtration, the
filtrate was evaporated and dried in vacuo to yield a yellow solid,
which was identified as ABAMA by 1H and 13C
NMR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS).

Nylon 4
The nylon 4 sample was supplied by the Biomedical
Research Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).4,8,9,11 The
molecular weight distribution was measured by TOSOH Analysis and Research
Center Co., Ltd. on a TOSOH HLC-8220GPC system equipped with two TOSOH
TSKgel Super AWM-H columns and a refractive index detector under the
following conditions: eluting solvent, HFIP including sodium trifluoroacetate
(10 mM); polymer concentration, 1 mg mL–1; column
temperature, 40 °C; flow rate, 0.3 mL min–1; injection volume, 20 μL; molecular weight calibration, poly(methyl
methacrylate) standards. The number-average and weight-average molecular
weights were evaluated to be 10.3 and 67.7 kDa, respectively. The
size-exclusion chromatographic (SEC) differential curve is shown in
Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

1H NMR Measurements
1H NMR spectra
of ABAMA were recorded at 400 MHz on a JEOL JNM-ECX400 spectrometer
equipped with a variable temperature control unit in the Center for
Analytical Instrumentation of Chiba University. The typical conditions
were as follows: scan, 32; 90° pulse width, 12 μs; acquisition
time, 6.6 s; recycle delay, 5.0 s; temperature range, 15 or 25 °C
to 45 or 55 °C; temperature interval, 10 °C. The free induction
decay was zero-filled before the Fourier transform so as to yield
enough digital resolution for the subsequent spectrum simulation.

The model compound was dissolved at a concentration of 50 mM in chloroform-d, methanol-d4, or dimethyl-d6 sulfoxide, injected into a 5 mm NMR sample
tube, and underwent the measurement. However, the TFE solution was
prepared differently: ABAMA was dissolved in nondeuterated TFE and
injected into a 3 mm glass tube (coaxial insert), the tube was inserted
into a normal 5 mm one, and the space between the inner and outer
tubes was filled with chloroform-d. The spectra thus
obtained were simulated with the gNMR program19 to yield 1H chemical shifts and 1H–1H coupling constants. 1H NMR of nylon 4 was measured
and analyzed similarly.

MO Calculations of the Model Compound
MO calculations
of ABAMA were carried out with the Gaussian 09 program54 installed on an HPC Silent-SCC T2 workstation.
For each conformer, the molecular geometry was fully optimized at
the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level under tight convergence, thermochemical
energies at 25 °C and 1 atm were computed by the frequency calculation
at the same level, and an accurate electronic energy was calculated
at the MP2/6-311+G(2d,p) level. The Gibbs-free energy (ΔGk) of conformer k was evaluated from the MP2 electronic and B3LYP thermochemical energies,
being expressed herein as the difference from that of the all-trans
conformer. The solvation effects on the MP2 electronic energy were
also evaluated by the polarizable continuum model using the integral
equation formalism variant (IEF-PCM).55

DFT Calculations on Crystal Structures under Periodic Boundary
Conditions
DFT calculations under the periodic boundary condition
were carried out with the CRYSTAL1456,57 program installed
in an HPC 5000-XBW216TS-Silent workstation. The initial data (i.e.,
lattice constants and atomic positions) for the structural optimization
of the α form35 of nylon 4 and the
α36,58 and γ16 forms of nylon 6 were taken from the crystal structures determined
by X-ray diffraction, and the total energy was minimized under the
following conditions: DFT, B3LYP with a dispersion force correction
(B3LYP-D) described below; basis set, 6-31G(d,p) or pob_TZVP; space
group, P21 (α form) or P21/a (γ form); self-consistent
field (SCF) convergence threshold, 10–7; truncation
criteria for bielectronic integrals, 10–7, 10–7, 10–7, 10–7,
and 10–14; integration grid, 75 radial and 974 angular
points; Fock/Kohn–Sham matrix mixing, 80% (with the modified
Broyden method);57 shrinking factor, 4.

Dispersion
Force Correction
As often pointed out, the
DFT calculations tend to underestimate the dispersion force, thus
being combined here with the empirical function (Edisp) formulated by Grimme59,60 17  where EDFT-D is the corrected energy and EDFT is
the energy as derived from the DFT calculation. The Edisp energy is expressed as 18  where s6 is the
global scaling factor, Nat is the number
of atoms included in the system, C6ij is the dispersion coefficient for atom
pair ij, and Rij is the distance between atoms i and j. Here, the damping factor is given as 19  where d represents
the steepness
of the damping function and Rr is the
sum of van der Waals radii (RvdW’s)
of atoms i and j. For nylons 4 and
6, the dispersion force parameters optimized by Milani et al.37 were used: s6 =
1.00, C6H = 0.14, C6C = 1.75, C6N = 1.23, C6O = 0.70, d = 20.0, RvdW(H) = 1.3013 Å, RvdW(C) = 1.70 Å, RvdW(N) = 1.55 Å, and RvdW(O)
= 1.52 Å, where C6X and RvdW(X) are the dispersion force coefficient and van der Waals radius
of element X, respectively. The reason for adoption of the above values
is that, of some parameter sets proposed so far, Milani’s data
yielded the best results for nylon 617,37,61 and in our recent study43 on polyethylene, poly(methylene oxide), poly(ethylene terephthalate),
poly(trimethylene terephthalate), and poly(butylene terephthalate).

Crystal Elasticity
The stiffness tensor, C, is a 6 × 6 symmetric matrix defined in the orthogonal coordinates
(x, y, z), and
the elements are numbered according to the Voigt notation: 1 = xx, 2 = yy, 3 = zz, 4
= yz, 5 = xz, and 6 = xy.62 The monoclinic lattice (standard orientation)
of nylons 4 and 6 has the following C tensor 20  where the dot • represents null. The
element cuv of the stiffness
tensor can be calculated from 21  where u and v represent the numbers (1–6) of the
Voigt notation, ϵ
is the rank-2 symmetric tensor of pure strain, and ECrystal and V are the total energy and
volume per crystal cell, respectively.

The compliance tensor, S, is the inverse matrix of C, and the S tensor of the monoclinic lattice is expressed as 22  

Young’s moduli in the x, y, and z directions (Ex, Ey, and Ez) are given
by Ex = s11–1, Ey = s22–1, and Ez = s33–1, respectively. Young’s modulus E(l1,l2,l3) in an arbitrary direction
defined with the unit vector (l1, l2, l3) of the monoclinic
lattice can be calculated from 23  

The C and S tensors were calculated
with the ELASTCON routine63,64 built in the CRYSTAL14
program under a rigid threshold (10–8) for the SCF
convergence. The number of points for calculation of the numerical
second derivative and the strain-step size along a given deformation
were set equal to 5 and 0.005, respectively.
