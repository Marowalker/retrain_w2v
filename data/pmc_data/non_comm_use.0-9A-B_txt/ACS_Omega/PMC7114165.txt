Hofmeister
series (HS), ion specific effect, or lyotropic sequence
acts as a pivotal part in a number of biological and physicochemical
phenomena, e.g., changing the solubility of hydrophobic solutes, the
cloud points of polymers and nonionic surfactants, the activities
of various enzymes, the action of ions on an ion-channel, and the
surface tension of electrolyte solutions, etc. This
review focused on how ion specificity influences the critical micelle
concentration (CMC) and how the thermoresponsive
behavior of surfactants, and the dynamic transition of the aggregate,
controls the aggregate transition and gel formation and tunes the
properties of air/water interfaces (Langmuir monolayer and interfacial
free energy). Recent progress of the ion specific effect in bulk phase
and at interfaces in amphiphilic systems and gels is summarized. Applications
and a molecular level theoretical explanation of HS are discussed
comprehensively. This review is aimed to supply a fresh and comprehensive
understanding of Hofmiester phenomena in surfactants, polymers, colloids,
and interface science and to provide a guideline to design the microstructures
and templates for preparation of nanomaterials.

==== Body
1 Introduction
As a significant solution,
electrolyte solutions play vital roles
in human life and physicochemical science.1 When electrolytes dissolve in water, they dissociate into hydrated
ions. Water molecules rearrange themselves in the hydration shells
of the smaller ions due to the largely electric field around the small
ions.2 Adding salts to protein aqueous
solution affects the protein solubility and many other physicochemical
properties of a protein solution.3 More
than a century ago, Franz Hofmeister primary determined the capability
of different salts to stabilize proteins from water, which depends
on the types and concentration of the salts.4a At present, this effect is classified as the Hofmeister series (HS),
lyotropic sequences, or ion specificity series and is a very widespread
phenomenon.5 The difference of the influence
of positive ions on precipitating proteins is smaller than negative
charged ions.3 According to the ability
of salts to influence the solubility of proteins in aqueous solution,
ions can be divided into “salting-in” or “salting-out”
ions.6

In recent decades, the ion
specificity effects have aroused a new
research upsurge because of their high impact in biological and physicochemical
science, ranging from protein folding and precipitation to ordering
of metal–organic frameworks (MOF) and macromolecules in bulk
solutions.7 In addition, the HS is of great
influence on polymers, colloids, and interface science. Extensive
investigations have been carried out on macroscopic (bulk) thermodynamic
behaviors including the CMC, solubility, and phase
behavior of surfactants, the dynamic tansition of the aggregates,
the swelling behavior of gels, and the cloud points of polymers, surface
tension, and the interface property in the existence of different
kinds of salts. Although being widely studied, the explanation of
the underlying mechanism behind the effect is still under debating.1a,1d In this review, we presented a comprehensive explanation of the
underlying mechanism of the HS at the molecular level, summarized
the influence of specific ion effects in polymers, surfactants, gels,
and the air/water interface, and described the application of the
ion specificity effect, which aims to give a new insight of the HS
and thus to provide a guideline for design of microstructures and
templates for preparing nanostructure. The following parts are involved:
(i) The background of the HS and the explanation of its mechanism
(Supporting Information); (ii) the influence
of the HS in polymer, micelles formation, phase transition of surfactant
systems, gel property, lipid bilayers, and air/water interfaces, etc; (iii) the applications of ion specificity effects (Supporting Information).

2 Background
of the Hofmeister Series
In 1888, Franz Hofmeister first
reported that the salts to precipitating
proteins and macromolecules out of aqueous solution generally follow
a specific ions series, known as the HS, lyotropic sequences, or ion
specificity.4a,4c In accordance of the capability
of salts to stabilize proteins in solution, the classical Hofmeister
ion series could be ranked. The overall order of the anion series
is as follows: CO32– > SO42– > S2O32– > H2PO4– > F– > Cl– > Br– > NO3– > I– > ClO4– > SCN– (Figure 1).7 The series
include two different groups: strongly hydrated ions and weakly hydrated
ions. Anions on the left of Cl– are well hydrated,
classified as kosmotrope ions (water structure maker), and tend to
stabilize the native fold structure of proteins, leading to salting-out
behavior.8a Meanwhile, anions on the right
of Cl– are poorly hydrated, called chaotropes (water
structure breaker), and tend to facilitate protein denaturation and
unfolding, showing salting-in behavior. Cl– is the
borderline between the two different kinds of ions, which has no obvious
effect on protein stability.8b Recently,
the reported larger anions such as anion borate cluster compounds
(ABCCs, including dodecaborate anions, metallacarboranes, and carborane
cluster) and polyoxometalates (POMs) have the propensity to associate
with the hydrophobic and neutral polar phase, which is named the chaotropic
effect.9a Simultaneously, theses ions are
termed as superchaotropic ions,9b listed
on the right of the HS (Figure 1), which extends the traditional HS. The superchaotropic ions
do not exhibit hydrophobic properties but arouse special effects in
molecular recognition with macrocyclic hosts and biological interaction
with proteins,9c−9e which influence is much higher than the chaotropic
ions (e.g., SCN–) (detailed discussion shown in section 3). The HS order
for cations is N(CH3)4+ > NH4+ > Cs+ > Rb+ >
Na+ > Li+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Zn2+ > Ba2+ (Figure 1).1d The weakly hydrated cations
on the left tend to stabilize the protein, whereas the divalent cations
on the right can increase the solubility of protein and promote their
unfolding. As is known, the HS for anions is more obvious than cations,
and the position of cation in the HS is always changed in different
phenomena.

Figure 1 Conceptual sketch of the Hofmeister series (HS).

With the development of thermochemistry, many researchers
attempt
to decide the ion property (structure making or breaking), typically
anions, via thermochemical functions, such as entropy (ΔS) and heat capacity (ΔCp).1b Marcus summarized the value of water-structural
entropies of ionic hydration (ΔSstruc) based on the ion properties and judged the ion property (kosmotropic
and chaotropic) using the ΔSstruc.1b,1e In the chemometric sense, with the value
of ΔS > 60 (J·K–1·mol–1), the anions are classified as water
structure breaker,
while with the values <60 J·K–1·mol–1 the anions are constructed as water structure maker.
For Cl– the value of ΔS is
about 60, which is defined as the borderline. In the chaotropicity
scale, the water structure arrounding the anions decreases, which
can be transformed to the effective loss of hydrogen bonding in the
solvation shell around the ions (ΔHB). Nau et al. suggested
that the ΔHB provides an approach for assessment of ion chaotropic
property.1f The anions are qualified as
chaotropes, as ΔHB is lower than −1, and the anions are
termed as superchaotropic anions when ΔHB < −2.

3 Insights into Ion Specificity Effects from Assembly
of Amphiphiles and Interface Property
Numerous phenomenas
in surfactants, polymers, and interface science
that involved salt exhibit obvious HS law. When being added into the
surfactant solution, salts would influence the conformation, CMC, solubility, phase behavior of surfactants, and the
dynamic transition of the aggregates. Moreover, they can regulate
the self-assembly of surfactant systems and the swelling behavior
of gels and can regulate the property of the air/water interface.
Since the appearance of the HS in 1888, scientists have paid much
attention to explore the ion specificity latent in colloids and interface
science. Here we summarized these pieces of research and gave some
typical examples of the ion specific effect on conformational change,
aggregate transition of amphiphiles, gels, and air/water interface,
etc., aiming to unfolding the fantastic Hofmeister series in colloid
and surface science.

3.1 Insights from Polymers
The salts
have at least four aspects of influence on polymers: (i) the variation
of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity; (ii) the shift of cloud point (CP);
(iii) the change of molecule structure conformation; (iv) the alteration
of lower critical solution temperature (LCST) or upper critical solution
temperature (UCST).10a Well hydrated anions
can reduce the solubility of polymer in solution, causing a salting-out
effect, whereas the poorly hydrated anions increase the stability
of polymer in solution, leading to the salting-in effect.10a For the nonionic surfactants, oligoethylene
oxide oleyl ether (CnH2n+1(OCH2CH2)mH, CnEOm) is greatly influenced
by anions in a sequence of HS (SO42– >
HPO42– > CrO4– > CO32– > Cl– > Br– > NO3– > I– > ClO4– > SCN–).10b The
kosmotropic anions, e.g., SO42– and CO32–, make CnEOm more hydrophobic
and the chaotropic anions, such as NO3– and ClO4–, cause the nonionic surfactant
to be more hydrophilic to facilitate the solubility of CnEOm.

The solubility of CnEOm decreases with temperature through the dehydration of −(O–CH2–CH2)x–OH
(the hydrogen bonding vanishing between the −O–CH2–CH2– group and water) and conformational
change (polar–nonpolar) of the −O–CH2–CH2– group.10c A liquid–liquid phase transition would occur in CnEOm aqueous solution with heating, and the corresponding
temperature is known as the cloud point (Tc). The Tc would be shifted when added
salt to CnEOm solutions, which depends on the
salt types and property (kosmotrope or chaotrope). The Tc of C8EO4 at 60 mmol·L–1 is 313 K.11a The classical
trend of anions in Tc evolution is WO42– > Cl– > SCN–, WO42– with SCN– acting
as kosmotrope and chaotrope, by reducing and rising Tc of C8EO4 of ±5 °C, respectively.
As important nanometric metal–oxide anions, POMs have large
size of ∼1 nm, delocalization charge, and low charge density,
classified as superchaotropic anions. The addition of POMs gives rise
to a more pronounced increase in Tc than
chaotropic anions in the HS at only very low concentrations. The Tc phenomenon of CnEOm is
attributed to the change in micelle shape. Upon heating, a sphere
to rod-like transition would occur because of the dehydration of the
−(O–CH2–CH2)– group,
accompanied by an enhancement in intermicellar attractions, giving
rise to the phase demixion. The micellar size of nonionic surfactants
is hardly affected by the traditional ions.11b However, since the adsorption of POM on CnEOm micelles is driven by the increase in entropy, the intermicellar
repulsions and reduction in the micelles size appeared, leading to
the remarkable increase in Tc. Recently,
Pfitzner found that the emancipation of hydration water molecules
from POMs to bulk phase caused the major entropic contribution for
adsorption.9b During the adsorption, few
water molecules are released, thus, stronger anion hydration caused
a less efficient dehydration, i.e., lower entropy gain. The effect
of anion polarizability on POMs is small as they scale with the dominant
driven force in specific ion effect, dispersion forces.11c

The Hofmeister ion-specific effect on
the conformational change
of poly(3-alkoxy-4-methylthiophene) (PMNT), a water-soluble cationic
polymer, was studied by Xia’s group through UV–vis spectroscopy,
resonance Raman spectroscopy, and MD simulation.5a They found that the anions related to a bathochromic-shift
absorption of PMNT in the anion sequence: SO42– < F– < Cl– < NO3– < Br– < I– < SCN–. When SO42– and F– were added, the UV–vis
absorption of PMNT has no obvious variation, whereas when I– and SCN– were added, bathochromic-shift absorption
is clearly observed. The absorption spectra results indicate that
different anions addition could induce configuration changes of PMNT.
MD evidence shows that this change can be ascribed to the direct interactions
between anions and the PMNT backbone, as shown in Figure 2. The ab inito calculation
together with MD simulation demonstrates that the PMNT backbone of
PMNT would be more extended and ordered with bathochromic-shift absorption
due to the strong suppression of I– inducing the
hydrophobic collapse of the PMNT backbone. The results can be ascribed
to two factors: (i) the electrical repulsion between two adjacent
side chains of PMNT would be prevent, because the I- approaches the
positively charged side chain; (ii) I– easily combines
with the apolar moieties of PMNT. While for kosmotropic anions, e.g.
F–, there does not combine with polymer, and since
the hydrophobic collapse of PMNT moieties, a fold random-coiled arrangement
of backbone with hardly absorption changes is obtained. Main in-plane
skeleton Raman modes were performed to further confirm the backbone
configurations of PMNT with different anions.5a The results do not supply an exhaustive explanation of the perplexing
effect of the HS on cationic conjugated polymers, but they play a
basic role of the HS on the structure–function relationships
of biomacromolecules.

Thermoresponsive polymers have a reversible phase transition with
the change in temperature, which have captured the collective imagination
of researchers due to their important applications.10a,12a As a thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide),
PNIPAM, exhibits a hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition at the
LCST. Below the LCST, PNIPAM is soluble with an extended coil conformation.12b However, PNIPAM becomes insoluble with a folded
arrangement above the LCST, causing the aqueous solution to turn to
a cloudy state. The LCST of PNIPAM in water is 305 K.12b Bergbreiter and co-workers12c found that the Hofmeister anions have an obvious influence
on the LCST of PNIPAM via a temperature gradient microfluidic apparatus
and dark-field microscopy determination. Their study reveals that
the anion effect on the LCST of PNIPAM is ascribed to three types
of interactions of anions with polymer and its hydrated water molecules.
The salt effects on the LCST can be modeled by eq 1:12d 1  where T0 is the
LCST of PNIPAM in pure solution and [M] is the molar concentration
of salt. The constant c has units of temperature
divided by molar concentration. KA is the binding constant between anion and polymer. Bmax is the maximum increase in the LCST.

As shown in Figure 3, the ability of anions to decrease the LCST agrees with the HS sequence.
The salting-out anions present a linear relationship at low salt concentration.
When the concentration reaches a certain value, a two-step transition
is observed, and the phase transition point is plotted. While for
the chaotropic species such as ClO4– and
SCN–, the effect of anions on the LCST is nonlinear.
In Figure 3a, the data
calculated from eq 1 are
shown with dashed lines. The experimental data coincide with the theoretical
calculation. The values of c, Bmax, and KA also
fit the experimental data. Zhang et al. synthesized a novel thermoresponsive
polymer, 2-hydroxy-3-isopropoxypropyl starches (HIPS), and studied
the influence of sodium salts on its Tc.12a In the presence of kosmotropic salts,
the hydrogen bonding between polymer and water would be destroyed;
meanwhile, some water molecules released from the polymer chains,
resulting in a reduction of polymer solubility and a dropping of Tc. On the contrary, chaotropic anions would
increase the solubility of polymer and elevate the Tc with concentration, owing to the direct binding to polymer
chains. At larger chaotrope concentrations, the Tc goes over a peak and then drops, due to the main driving
force of hydrogen bonding between polymer and water, as shown in Figure 3b.

salts at different concentrations (0 to 1.0 M). The dashed lines are

Compared to wide investigations
of the specific anion effect in
aqueous solutions, the study of the Hofmeister effect in nonaqueous
solvent (organic or water–organic mixtures) has drawn little
attention. Li’s group first investigated the ion specificity
of the polymer system in water–organic solvent mixtures and
demonstrated that the ranking of ions in the mixed solvent also followed
the HS, which could be amplified by adding organic solvents (such
as alcohols (EtOH) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) to aqueous solution.
The tendency of amplification of a specific anion effect can be monitored
through the stability of the H2O–ethanol complex,
which greatly depends on the structure of alcohols.13a Recently, they systematically studied the anionic specificity
on LCST and UCST behavior of PNIPAM in mixed solvent (H2O–EtOH and H2O–DMSO).13b At low molar fraction of EtOH (xE) or DMSO (xD), PNIPAM has a LCST and
at relatively high xE or xD, presents a UCST behavior. Turbidity and DSC studies
showed that LCST for the anions is consistent with the HS at the molar
fraction of xE or xD of 6%, since the solubility of PNIPAM in mixtures is mainly
driven by the interactions among water, anion, and PNIPAM. Above the
UCST, PNIPAM is soluble, while below the UCST it becomes insoluble.
Thus, lower UCST suggested higher solubility. In H2O–EtOH
mixtures, at xE = 20%, the anionic specificity
on UCST follows the HS, since the dominant driving forces for the
UCST are consistent with the LCST behavior. In H2O–DMSO
mixtures, at xD= 70%, the anion sequence
for the UCST abides by the following series: SCN– < ClO4– < NO3– < Br– > Cl– > CH3COO–. The reason might be that
adsorption of the PNIPAM chain surface for anions and anionic polarization
of hydrogen bonding between DMSO and PNIPAM have a converse influence
on the ranking of HS for UCST. The results revealed that the combined
effect of polymer surface adsorption for anions and the anionic polarization
of hydrogen bonding between solvent and polymer has a significant
role in the anionic specificity on the phase transition of PNIPAM
in water–organic mixed solvent mixtures. Thus, we summarize
that one can controllably regulate the LCST or Tc of polymer solution by adding different salts to the solution.

As the superchaotropic ions, ABCCs have an intrinsic amphiphilic
nature, whose micellization is enthalpy-driven with dominant interactions
of hydrophobic (metallacarboranes) or chaotropic (dodecaborate) effect.
Due to the surface activity and aggregation mechanism, nanocomposites
would be formed when these clusters mixed with polymers.14a The polymeric composites are formed through
the spontaneous precipitation of a metallacarborane cluster with poly(ethylene
oxide), PEO, in salts.14b The solid NMR
results show that the spontaneous precipitation of cluster/PEO complex
is dominated by the interaction of dihydrogen bonding between the
B–H section of the cluster and the CH2 section of
the polymer backbone, assisted by the complexation of cations by PEO.
The nanocomposites have a distinct and highly ordered inner structure.
Subsequently, the amorphous composites are produced via the coassembly
of metallacarborane anion clusters and cationic poly(vinylpyridine)
(PVP), in which the orientation of the cluster is dominated by the
location of positive charges on the polymer chain.14c Recently, in the presence of Li+, Na+, and K+, the coassembly process of the metallacarborane
cluster and double-hydrophilic block copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(2-alkyl oxazoline) (PEO–POX) was studied,
aiming to estimate the preferred interaction of cluster with PEO or
POX segments of the polymer.14b In the
Na-medium, the ABCCs cluster has the same binding ability to PEO and
POX section, leading to the formation of homogeneous nanostructures.
Li+ has strong binding ability to the O-group in amidic
compounds, and the combination of Li+ and clusters with
POX is prioritized, which changes the equilibrium toward the complexation
of cluster–POX leading to an obvious compartmentalization of
POX segments within the hybrid nanoparticles. K+ can be
strongly interacted with the PEG section, and simultaneously the PEO-compartments
formed. The relatively simple self-assembly procedure of polymer and
ABCCs could be used for the preparation of novel polymer–ABCCs
complexes with desired functionalities, which provide an approach
to build sophisticated supramolecular systems. However, the study
of coassembly of ABCCs with polymers is in its infancy and requires
further investigation.

3.2 Insights from Micelle Formation
In
water, above the CMC, surfactants would spontaneously
aggregate to spherical micelles, and at a higher concentration they
grow to rodlike micelles. Packing parameter, P (P = v/a0l0, where v is the surfactant tail volume, a0 is
the area per headgroup, and l0 is the
surfactant chain length), can be used to predict the micellar shape.15a When P < 1/3, spherical
micelles would form, while for 1/3 < P < 1/2,
rod-like or worm-like micelles would be produced, and for P ∼ 1, a planar aggregate would form. The electrostatic
repulsions between charged headgroups can be screened by adding inorganic
salts to ionic surfactant solution, which is beneficial to aggregate,
leading to the decreasing CMC, the increasing micelle
size, and the transition from spherical to worm-like micelles.15b Sodium salts with simple anions to decrease
the CMC of ionic surfactants correlate well with
the HS law, because the large polarizability of anions enhances the
binding of counterions at the micellar surface and screens the electrostatic
repulsion among headgroups of surfactant.15bCMC variation dependence on the salt concentration
can be expressed by the empiric eq 2: 2  where A and K0 are empirical constants, Z is the valence
of counterions, and ci is the counterions concentration. Compared with the ionic surfactants,
upon introduction of salts to nonionic surfactants solution the CMC is hardly changed. Adding salts to nonionic surfactant
micellar solution mainly affects the “salting-out” or
“salting-in” action. The CMC is decreased
by “salting-out” anions and increased by “salting-in”
anions.15c

The size of micelles formed
by alklglycosides is systematically investigated by Ericsson et al.15d The decrease of micellar size follows the HS
sequence: SO42– > Cl– > Br– > NO3– > I– > SCN–. I– and
SCN– are chaotropic anions (salting-in) which cause
a decrease of micellar size. They found that the salts’ effect
on effective headgroup size has more influence on micellar shape than
unimer solubility.

Regulating micellar shape characteristics
is significant for surfactant
function. Abezgauz et al. utilize cryogenic transmission electron
microscopy (cryo-TEM), rheology, and scattering to investigate the
influence of salts on cetylpyridinium chloride (CPyCl) micelles solution.15a They found that the nature and concentration
of added anions and the place in the HS greatly affect the micellar
structure. The salting-out anions, Br–, NO3–, and Cl–, induce a sphere →
rod-like → worm-like micelles transition, whereas the salting-in
anions, CO32–, PO43–, OH–, and SO42–,
have no influence on the micellar shape and viscosity. The reason
might be that pyridinium headgroups of CPyCl are a chaotropic species
and fit the Collin’s law of matching affinities. The results
provide a method to methodically tune the self-assembly process of
cationic surfactants, including the micellar transition and micellar
growth.15e

3.3 Insights from Gels
Organic or inorganic
salts can greatly influence the solubility and the aggregates morphology
of amphiphiles (polymers, surfactants, or lipids) in aqueous solution.
Thus, the addition of sodium salts can effectively modulate the assembled
structures of gelators, which provides a powerful approach to control
the production of various aggregates from a single gelator. The influence
of anions on the hydrophobic interaction of gelators and the more
organized supramolecular structures decreases from kosmotrope to chaotrope,
causing the decreasing in critical gelation concentrations (CGCs), stability, and the mechanical strength of gels in
the order of the HS.16 Ulijn and co-workers
found that different morphologies can be produced in gels with different
sodium salts.17a Gels formed in PO43– consisted of a fibrous network corresponding
to a higher strength. While for SCN–, spherical
aggregates formed with a lower strength, for the chloride system,
fibers were obtained with similar dimensions to phosphate samples
but presented irregular and bendy morphology. The mechanism of an
ion-specific effect on the gels’ morphology is the combination
of electrostatic screening, ion binding, and hydrophobic interactions.
The results open a novel approach to regulate molecular assembly in
gel formation.

In addition, the anions in the HS have a strong
influence on the swelling behavior of polymer hydrogels and have been
extensively studied by Howse et al.17b The
swelling degree of polymer hydrogels can be expressed by the expansion
ratio (ER), defined as eq 3: 3  d is the equilibrium domain
spacing and d0 is the dry domain spacing.
The ER of ionic hydrogels depends on the balance
between osmotic pressure (ions inside and outside of hydrogels), polymer–solvent
combination, and elastic retractile force of polymers. Osmotic pressure
is dominant in these variables; thus, the effect of salts on the expansion
must be correlated with this interaction. The ion–water interactions
also cause the swelling behavior of polymer gels. The effect of sodium
salts on equilibrium ER of poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) gels is shown in Figure 4. The ER value would decrease with the increase
of salt concentration (Figure 4b). The decrease in swelling is attributed to the distribution
of anions between gels and solution, at fixed salt concentration.
The more chaotropic anions easily distribute in the gel, which increases
the local ionic strength and causes considerable collapse in gel structure.17b Thus, the decrease of ER induced
by anions is as follows: Ace– > Cl– > NO3– > Br– > I– > SCN–.

of counterions on ER of PMMA, (b) effect
of X– (Cl–, Br–, and I–) surface charge density on ER of PMMA at ionic strength of 0.1 mol·L–1 (black
circle) and 0.3 mol·L–1 (red square). Reprinted

The thermoresponsive gelation behaviors are mainly driven
by hydrogen
bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Adding salts could change the
hydrophobicity of gelators in water and shift the gel–sol transition
temperature (Tgel).17c The ionic specific effect on Tgel of gels follows the HS law. The kosmotropic anions (e.g., CO32–, SO42–,
F–) show a “salting-out” effect and
enhance the gel–sol transition, leading to a lower Tgel, while the chaotropic anions (e.g., I–, SCN–, ClO4–) exhibit salting-in behavior, causing a higher Tgel. Compared to anions, cations have a weaker effect
on the gel–sol transition, and the effect is ascribed to the
electrostatic interaction between cations and gelators.18a In the cation HS, divalent cations and gelators
have stronger electrostatic interactions than monovalent cations;
thus, divalent cations have a more remarkable effect on Tgel.18a Moreover, the addition
of X– into gels would form X . . .H hydrogen
bonding and break the original hydrogen bonding, resulting in the
disruption of gel and exhibiting a gel–sol transition. Thus,
the addition of F–, AcO–, Cl–, and Br– into the gels formed by
the low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs), d-gluconic acetal-based
molecules, induced a gel–sol transition within several hours,
while for the I–, a gel–sol transition was
not observed, even after 48 h.17c The influence
of anions on gel disruption also follows the HS: H2PO4– > F– > AcO– > Cl– > Br– > I–. The transition process was monitored
by 1H NMR spectroscopy
performed to monitor the transition process. Yin’s group explored
the influence of ions on the gelation of LMWGs, l-glutamic
acid Schiff base derives in nonaqueous solvent, DMSO. They found that
the gelation capability of anions and the Tgel followed the sequence of SO42–, H2PO4–, AcO–,
F–, NO3–, HSO4–, NO2–, which was
consistent with the HS.18b That is to say,
the gels produced with salting-out anions are more stable compared
to the gels formed by salting-in anions. As the effective hydrogen
bonding acceptors, anions are greatly competitive in the network structure
formation of gels; therefore, the anion specificity has aroused a
new research upsurge within the field of LMWGs gels.

3.4 Insight from Phase Transition
Because
of the charged headgroups of surfactants, the introduction of salts
has diverse influence on surfactant solution, such as aggregation
transition and phase separation. The addition of salts to cationic–anionic
surfactant systems would screen the electrostatic attractions between
oppositely charged headgroups of surfactant, which affects the effective
headgroup area and causes the aggregation transition.19

For the equimolar cationic–anionic surfactant
mixtures, decyltriethylammonium bromide (C10NE) and sodium
decylsulfonate (C10SO3Na), the HS anions shield
the electrostatic repulsion, increase a0, and decrease P, giving rising to an aggregate
transition from vesicle to micelle.19 The
influence of NaX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) on C10NE-C10SO3 mixtures is shown in Figure 5. The addition of NaF can increase the size
of C10NE-C10SO3 vesicles, and the
concentration of NaF increases to a value where phase separation would
occur. The surfactant–water interface can be stabilized by
Br– and I– through preferential
combination with surfactant, resulting in a “salting-in”
effect. Thus, a decreasing of the size of C10NE-C10SO3 aggregates and the vesicle-to-micelle transition appears
by the addition of NaBr or NaI. I– has higher ability
in decreasing the aggregate size than Br–, which
is consistent with the HS law. Since Cl– is the
intermediate anion in the HS, the effect of NaCl on the C10NE-C10SO3 vesicles is small.20

In cationic–anionic surfactant mixtures
with excess anionic
surfactant, the excess anions would compete with the headgroups, resulting
in less hydration of headgroups with increasing ionic strength.19 The weaker hydration caused a smaller effective a0, resulting in a higher P and amicelle-to-vesicle transition. In dodecyltrimethylammonium
bromide (DTAB) and excess sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mixtures, an
aggregate transition from rod-like micelles to vesicles occurred after
addition of salts into the mixtures.. After the formation of vesicles,
no anion specificity appeared upon adding salts. Whereas the nature
of the cations had strong influence on the critical salt concentration
of aggregate transition micelles-to-vesicles,21 the effect of cations on aggregate transition was studied by changing
the concentration of alkali chloride salts. As shown in Figure 6a, the mean hydrodynamic radius
(Rh) of micelles increases from 10 to
70 nm with increase in salt concentration. Based on the ability to
increase the Rh of the aggregates, the
cations can be ordered: Cs+ ∼ Rb+ ≥
K+ > Na+ > Li+. Cryo-TEM observation
further confirms the transition from ribbon-like micelle to vesicles
in the presence of salts (Figure 6b and c).21

Interfacial molarities
variation during the micelles to vesicles
transition in sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) solution
after adding salts was monitored by chemical trapping (CT).22a The transition from micelle to vesicle has
specificity to cation and obeys the HS (Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li+), no matter the
anion type. A great reduction in interfacial water molarity and an
increase in interfacial headgroup molarity concurrently appeared,
as shown in Figure 7. The added salts increase
the interfacial molarities causing an increase in P and resulting in a series phase transition (micelles to vesicles
to lamellar structures). When salts were added into the AOT micelles
solutions, an ion-pair would form in the interfacial regions and some
water would be released. Due to the diffusion of water molecules into
the bulk phase the solution entropy increases, which also contributes
to the micelle-to-vesicle transition.

Compared with the halogens and oxoacids in the HS, POMs are negatively
charged metal oxide clusters with large size of about 1 nm. Due to
strong electrostatic interaction, POMs can be strongly adsorbed onto
the zwitterionic or cationic lipid bilayer, causing fluid-to-gel phase
transition and structure breaking of the bilayer. POM adsorption on
the lipid bilayer could release energy, which comes from the enthalpy
related to gelation and the entropy relevant to local surface rebuilding
of the bilayer.22b The liposome shrinkage
and morphological breaking further confirmed the reconstruction of
the lipid bilayer induced by POMs.

Saha found that KClO4, KI, KCl, and KF could affect
the interaction between host and guest molecule.16 At a lower salts concentration, host–guest complexes
are more stable, and the fluorescence intensity enhances. The fluorescence
property can be regulated by adding different potassium salts. Regulating
the optical properties of the dye in β-cyclodextrin nanochannels
could promote researchers to synthesize more supramolecular materials.22c,22d

At a given temperature, adding anions can also induce aggregate
transition. Increase of kosmotropic anion concentration can decrease
the transition temperature, whereas increase of the chaotropic anions
concentration increases the transition temperature. Koynova and co-workers
derived a general thermodynamic equation to give a quantitative description
of the anions effect on transition temperature, which is similar to
the Clausius–Claperyron equation interrelating transition temperature
and pressure, as shown in eq 4:22e 4  where x is the fraction of
interfacial water per surfactant molecule, c is the
solute concentration in interfacial water, ΔH is the molar transition heat, and R is the gas
constant; the prime and second signs denote the high and low temperature
phase, respectively.

The specific anions effect on phase transition
temperature was
investigated by Zhang et al.8b PEO–PPO–PEO
polymer solution contains weakly hydrated anions and shows two different
phase transitions. The first phase transition involves the dehydration
of PPO block at lower temperature, which represents the critical micellization
temperature. The second phase transition refers to the dehydration
of PEO block, which exhibits cloud point temperature. The transition
temperature presents a complex dependence on salts nature and concentration.
The phase transition modulation of PEO–PPO–PEO by adding
salts can be described by eqs 1 and (5). In the presence of weakly
hydrated anions, the first phase transition is fit with eq 1. The second phase transition can
be described by eq 5: 5  where c, the value for strongly
hydrated and weakly hydrated anions, correlates with different properties
of anions.8b

3.5 Insights
from Langmuir Monolayer
Lenotids’s group studied the
effect of sodium salts on the
Langmuir monolayer of a zwitterionic lipid, 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine
(DPPC).23 Since DPPC is zwitterionic, the
interaction between DPPC and anions is not mainly driven by Coulomb
interactions. Adding salts to the subphase of the DPPC monolayer can
increase the pressure at fixed molecular area, which suggests the
stabilization of the liquid-expanded phase (LEP) of the monolayer.
The surface pressure–molecular area (π–A) isotherms
of DPPC on the water surface and 0.1 mol·L–1 sodium salt solutions are shown in Figure 8a. In the range between 80 to 90 Å2, the monolayer is in irregular LEP.24 In the area range of 80 to 90 Å2, all isotherms
are general parallel to water, which suggests that the change of π
is ascribed to the absorption of salts at the DPPC monolayer. Different
anions increase the π following the sequence: Cl– < Br– < NO3– < I– < BF4– < ClO4– < SCN–, coinciding with classical HS law. Figure 8b shows a direct illustration of different
anions on the DPPC Langmuir monolayer. A straight line is obtained
with the slopes being consistent with the HS law.

The surface hydrophobicity can be quantified by interfacial free
energy (γ). For macroscopic surfaces, γ is referred to
as the energy needed to increase the exposure area of water or solution
surfaces, which can be measured by the work of adhesion, Wad. The Wad is defined as
the energy required to divide the two surfaces surrounded with water
or aqueous solution. For two chemically identical surfaces: 6  Serafin and co-workers studied the
Hofmeister-type
anion effect on γ of hydrophobic monolayers through Wad determination in chemical force microscopy
(CFM).24,25 The selected anions span the range of the
HS, from kosmostropic Na2SO4 to chaotropic NaSCN.
The specific-ion dependence on the γ of aliphatic (terminal
methyl) and aromatic (terminal phenyl) monolayers was studied and
shown in Figure 9.
The general trend for the aliphatic monolayer agrees well with the
HS law: SO42– > Cl– > NO3– > I– > SCN–, i.e., chaotropic ions decrease γ,
whereas kosmotropic
ions increase it. However, for the aromatic monolayer, the specific-ion
behavior substantially deviates from the HS law. Especially, NaBr
and NaNO3 solutions present a great increase in γ
compared to water. The differences between aromatic and aliphatic
surface are attributed to the metal−π (or metal−π–π)
interactions and the “normal” hydrophobic specific-ion
effect. The specific ion effect on an aromatic surface provides novel
perception into the cosolvent effect on biologically relevant processes.25

4 Conclusions
and Outlook
Many physicochemical and biological phenomena
are relevant to the
electrolytes solution properties, especially water. Numerous phenomena
in colloids, polymers, and interface science that involved salts exhibit
dramatic ion specificity. At present, ABCCs and POMs greatly extend
the HS and promote the progress of the HS in colloid and interfaces
science. This review systematically described the counterions and
superchaotropic ions (ABCCs and POMs) effects on colloids and interface
field, including the thermoresponsiveness of polymers, the CGC and the swelling behavior of gels and gel–sol
transition, the phase transition of cationic–anionic systems,
the micelles formation, and the Langmuir monolayer, which aims to
provide a novel perception into ion specificity from the assembly
and the interface properties of amphiphiles. Two model mechanisms,
indirect and direct mechanisms of action, including the molecular
level explanation, were elaborately discussed to explain the mechanism
behind the Hofmeister effect. In general, the ions specific effect
on the variation of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, the shift of cloud
point, the alteration of LCST or UCST of polymers, on decreasing the CMC of surfactants and decreasing in CGCs, stability, the mechanical strength and the Tgel of gels, and the increase in surface pressure are coincident
with the direct HS. The variation of shift of cloud point, change
of molecule structure conformation of polymers, the decrease of ER and Tgel of gels, phase transition,
can be explained by the direct actions mechanism. The variation of
hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of polymers can be explained by the
indirect actions mechanism. The alteration of LCST or UCST of polymer
can be explained by the combination of indirect actions and direct
actions. However, the actual solution systems are inevitably complicated
by a delicate balance of all the interactions (water–water,
water–ions, water–solutes, ions–solutes, cations–anions),
which requires much more strenuous effort to give a molecular level
interpretation. Moreover, many experimental techniques should be developed
to determine the microscopic structures of solutes and solvents and
to provide deep insight into the involved mechanisms dominant in the
dynamics of water and ions.

In the past several decades, a number
of ion specific effects on
surfactant systems were reported. However, the investigation mainly
focused on the anion effect, and few cation effects were considered.
In order to give an overall understanding of the ion specific effect
in colloidal systems, the effect of cations on the amphiphile assembly
and air/water interface property should be undertaken in the next
investigation. The ion–dipole and nonelectrostatic interactions
play important roles in the Hofmeister effect; thus, the HS is not
restricted to aqueous solution but can exist in organic solvents,
e.g., ethanol, DMSO, and ethylene carbonate, etc., which should be
paid much attention in further research. In addition, since the Hofmeister
effect could modulate the aggregates transition via imparting different
salts, it is envisaged to be used for constructing microstructures
and templates for different practical applications in the future.
