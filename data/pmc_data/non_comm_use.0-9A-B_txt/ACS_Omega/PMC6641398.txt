Highly
uniform and hyper-cross-linked polyphenanthrene and polypyrene
microspheres were synthesized by Friedel–Crafts bromomethylation
of phenanthrene (Phn) and pyrene (Py) in the presence of zinc bromide
as a catalyst, followed by self-polymerization of bromomethylated
Phn and Py. The resultant 3-D carbon microspheres consisting of micro-,
meso-, and macropores bear peripheral unreacted bromomethyl groups,
which are directly utilized as catalysts to efficiently promote the
electrophilic substitution reaction of indoles with aldehydes to yield
a variety of bis(indolyl)methanes. The important features of this
catalysis are easy catalyst synthesis, high product yields, environmental
benignity, short reaction time, broad substrate scope, use of nontoxic
solvents, and recyclability.

Introduction
At present, several
researchers are focusing their efforts on developing
green chemical methods to decrease costs, hazards, waste, and energy
consumption using ecological reagents and reaction conditions for
chemical synthesis. The realization of several modifications in a
single process is consistent with the goals of green and sustainable
chemistry.1 In particular, the use of environmentally
benign solvents [e.g., water, glycerol, and ethylene glycol (EG)],
solvent-free conditions, or nontraditional methods (e.g., ultrasound,
grinding, and microwaves) represents a highly potent and green chemical
protocol for cost-effective synthesis.2

Bis(indolyl)methanes (BIMs) and their derivatives are promising
nitrogen-containing compounds that are present in a variety of natural
products and synthetic compounds.3 Furthermore,
BIMs and their analogues show a wide range of biological and pharmacological
activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial,
antibiotic, and analgesic properties.4 In
addition, BIMs reportedly exhibit anticancer activity, preventing
the growth of cancerous cells,5 including
those of colon,5c cervical, prostate,5a,5b pancreatic,5d,5e and lung.5f The most significant metabolite of indole-3-carbinol, dimeric
3,3′-bis(indolyl)methane, plays a significant role in inhibiting
breast cancer.5g,5h Indole–carbazole derivatives
are known to act as triplet energy materials,6 whereas oxidized BIMs are used as colorimetric sensors7,8 and dyes.9

Owing to their significant
biological and pharmacological properties,
there is an increasing interest in a facile route for the preparation
of BIMs. In general, the electrophilic substitution of indoles with
carbonyl compounds is usually mediated by Brønsted or Lewis acids,10,11 ionic liquids, or heteropolyacids.12,13 In general,
the use of toxic reagents, high catalyst loading, use of expensive
catalysts, and volatile organic solvents are among the drawbacks of
these methods. Hence, the search for methodologies to reduce the environmental
impact of the synthesis of BIMs is of great interest to the pharmaceutical
industry. The use of green chemicals or solvent-free conditions, including
nonclassical methods using grindstone, microwaves,14 ultrasound,15 and eco-friendly
reagents and catalysts,16 is among the
most viable alternatives being considered to improve the synthesis
of BIMs.

In the past few years, porous organic polymers have
attracted significant
attention for potential applications in gas adsorption,17 sensing,18 catalysis,19−21 proton conduction,22 and energy storage.23 As a result, researchers have attempted to produce
a number of novel porous materials such as covalent organic frameworks,24 metal organic frameworks,25 conjugated microporous polymers (MOPs),26 covalent triazine frameworks,27 hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs),28 and microporous organic polymers, in addition to traditional porous
materials such as zeolites and activated carbon. Among these porous
materials, HCPs and MOPs have been most widely studied because of
their unique properties such as large surface area, low skeletal density,
and high chemical stability. The HCPs have been synthesized mainly
by the hyper-cross-linking of small organic molecules by the Friedel–Crafts
alkylation reaction with an external cross-linker.29 Davankov resin is one of the styrenic polymers that are
hyper-cross-linked by the Friedel–Crafts reaction.30 However, tedious synthetic processes are required,
and the resultant resins bear nonuniform pores. Recently, we fabricated
highly uniform HCPs based on a simple Friedel–Crafts alkylation
of aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene
(Phn), pyrene (Py), and coronene, followed by self-polymerization,
as supercapacitor materials, gas absorption, and support for heterogeneous
catalysts.31

For several years, we
have developed new methodologies for the
synthesis of bioactive compounds by following the principles of green
chemistry, including the use of neat conditions,32 cheap and recyclable heterogeneous catalysts,33 grindstone method,34 ionic liquid catalysts, and energy-efficient protocols.35 On the basis of our studies on HCPs and the
synthesis of bioactive compounds, we found that the HCPs could be
a good candidate for the green synthesis of BIMs because HCPs are
characterized by easy synthesis and chemical and thermal stability
and contain unreacted halogen groups on their surface which can directly
catalyze the electrophilic substitution reaction of indoles with aldehydes
to yield a variety of BIMs. In this regard, we report the synthesis
of HCPs by Friedel–Crafts bromomethylation of Phn and Py in
the presence of zinc bromide as a catalyst, followed by self-polymerization
of bromomethylated Phn and Py. The resultant 3-D carbon microspheres
bearing unreacted bromomethyl functionality (Figure 1) on the surface contain micropores, mesopores,
and macropores and were directly used as a catalyst for the preparation
of biologically potent BIMs. Following green protocols, no solvents
were used at mild reaction conditions and catalyst recycle feasibility
was also examined.

spheres

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Polyphenanthrene and
Polypyrene
The HCP spheres were prepared by a one-pot protocol
without using
any templates. Highly uniform spheres of an average diameter of ∼1
μm began to form after 10 min of reactions of Phn or Py with
bromomethyl methyl ether (BMME) at 70 °C in the presence of the
ZnBr2 catalyst. This initial morphology was retained even
after 18 h of reaction. Figure 2d shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of polyphenanthrene
(PPhn) and polypyrene (PPy) spheres after 18 h of reaction. Friedel–Crafts
bromomethylation of Phn or Py followed by cross-linking produces energy-minimized
spherical particles in the 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) solvent bearing
micropores formed by interconnected −CH2–
bridges (see Figure 1). It is interesting to note that the HCP spheres intrinsically bear
unreacted bromomethyl groups on the surface. The unreacted bromomethyl
groups on the surfaces of PPhn (PPhn@CH2Br) and PPy (PPy@CH2Br) spheres were also traced using Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra (Figure 2a). The absorption peaks at 2892 and 2909 cm–1 clearly
represent the methylene bridge of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br, respectively. The absorption peaks at 1090, 741, 1099,
and 752 cm–1 correspond to the C–H wagging
and C–Br stretching vibrations, indicating the existence of
unreacted bromomethyl groups. The concentrations of unreacted bromine
groups of the PPhn and PPy samples estimated calorimetrically using
Hg(SCN)236 were 0.29 and 0.31
mg/L, respectively (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Most of this bromomethyl groups will be removed
by calcination at a high temperature. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
spectra of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br samples
(Figure 2b) show the
amorphous nature of the samples. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
curves of both PPhn and PPy spheres (Figure 2c) show a sharp weight loss at ∼500
°C; the overall weight loss at 800 °C is 28.6 and 34.8%,
respectively. The larger weight loss of PPy is presumably due to the
existence of a larger amount of organic components that can be calcined,
such as bromomethyl groups and loosely cross-linked aromatic rings.

spectra, (b) XRD patterns, (c) TGA thermograms, (d) SEM
images, (e) nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms, and (f)
pore size distribution of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br.

The PPhn@CH2Br and
PPy@CH2Br samples with
no thermal treatments were further investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
experiments. The nitrogen absorption–desorption isotherms of
both samples are type IV curves (Figure 2e), and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br are estimated to be 550 and 628 m2 g–1, respectively, indicating a highly porous structure bearing micro-,
meso-, and macropores.

PPy@CH2Br-Catalyzed Synthesis
of BIMs
The
synthesized PPy@CH2Br sample was tested as potential HCP-based
solid catalysts for the synthesis of BIMs. As shown in Table 1, 35 biologically potent BIMs
could be synthesized in high yields (83–96%) using PPy@CH2Br catalysts under neat conditions. Among the synthesized
BIMs, compounds 6–11 and 23–28 have not been previously reported in the literature. Accordingly,
the PPy@CH2Br-catalyzed synthesis of BIMs offers several
advantages in terms of easy operational procedure, high product yields,
good stability of the catalyst, and recyclability (vide infra). All
synthesized BIMs were confirmed by IR, 1H, and 13C NMR spectroscopies. In their 1H NMR spectra, the −NH
proton signals typically appeared as a singlet in the region of 10.81–7.41
ppm. The Ar–CH proton signal also appeared as a singlet in
the region of 6.48–5.56 ppm, confirming product formation,
and the remaining proton signals were observed in the expected regions.
In the 13C NMR spectra of the products, the Ar–CH
carbon signals were observed in the region of 54.1–32.2 ppm,
confirming the formation of BIMs (Supporting Information).37

For further investigations
into the effect of operational conditions,
a series of reactions of indole (1.0 mmol) with benzaldehyde (0.6
mmol) were performed under different conditions (Table 2). First, the reaction was performed
under neat conditions using 5 mg of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br as the catalyst with constant stirring at room temperature
(rt) for 1 h and under an open atmosphere. The target BIM (1) was obtained in 25 and 40% yields, respectively (entries 1 and
2). To increase the product yield, the amount of catalyst was increased
to 5 and 10 mg, resulting in 50 and 73% yields, respectively, of 1 (entries 3 and 4). Increasing the reaction temperature to
40 and 60 °C, BIMs were obtained in 75, 85, 90, and 96% yield
(entries 5–8). Phn and Py were tested as catalysts for the
reaction; however, the yield was only 20 and 25%, respectively (entries
9 and 10). It is worth noting that the carbonized PPhn (PPhn–C)
and PPy (PPy–C) samples of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br samples, respectively, show no catalytic activities at
rt (entries 11 and 12). To compare the effect of bromomethyl group
on the activity, we synthesized PPy@CH2OMe using dimethoxymethane
as a cross-linker bearing no bromomethyl groups on the periphery.
The PPy@CH2OMe sample shows reasonable but much lower catalytic
activities, 35 and 68% at 25 and 60 °C, respectively (entries
13 and 14), than those of the PPy@CH2Br sample obtained
at the same conditions. These results clearly demonstrate that the
bromomethyl moieties on the surface of PPhn@CH2Br and PPy@CH2Br samples play an important catalytic role in this reaction
medium. The higher catalytic activity of PPy@CH2Br than
PPhn@CH2Br is thus related with the higher concentration
of CH2Br groups of the PPy@CH2Br sample than
that of PPhn@CH2Br. The optimum yield (96%) of BIM 1 was achieved by reacting 1.0 mmol of the indole with 0.6
mmol of the aldehyde under neat condition at 60 °C for 1 h with
10 mg of the PPy@CH2Br catalyst (entry 8). Table 2 shows that the catalytic activity
of PPy@CH2Br for the electrophilic substitution of indole
is dependent on the reaction temperature. To further investigate the
kinetics, the yield versus time plots of this catalytic reaction are
prepared at 25, 40, 50, and 60 °C (Figure 3). At all temperatures, the yields increase
sharply at the early period of reaction and the extent of increment
falls as the time goes by. These kinetics are a typical case observed
for the heterogeneous catalytic reactions involving the adsorption
of reactants and surface reactions (vide infra).

Figure 3 Yield vs time plots of
the synthesis of BIM 1 in the
presence of PPy@CH2Br at different temperatures. The yields
were measured by comparing 1H NMR spectra of the samples
taken at specific reaction times.

Next, we aimed
to verify the effect of the neat method and different
solvents in accelerating the catalytic reaction. The effects of the
various solvents were compared, and the results are presented in Table 1 (entries 8 and 15–21).
The reaction conducted in water using PPy@CH2Br at 60 °C
for 1 h resulted in only a 50% yield of the target BIM. When the same
experiment was conducted at 100 °C, the product yield remained
unchanged. Therefore, water was replaced with other eco-friendly solvents
such as poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight = 400; PEG-400), glycerol,
and EG. These solvents also resulted in low product yields of about
50% (entries 17–19). When the same reactions were conducted
in the presence of toluene and benzene, the product yields were recorded
to be 88 and 86%, respectively, which indicates that the product yields
were low in protic solvents in comparison to those in nonprotic solvents.

To investigate the applicability and limitations of PPy@CH2Br catalysis, the protocol was extended to other examples
under optimized conditions. Initially, diverse aromatic/heterocyclic
aldehydes were reacted with indole with conventional heating and under
neat conditions, affording BIMs in good to excellent yields within
1 h. These results are summarized in the Experimental
Section (see also the Supporting Information). No remarkable reactivity differences were observed by the presence
of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups in the benzaldehyde
ring. As an exception, the heterocyclic substrate, 1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole carboxaldehyde, gave the respective BIM in a
lower yield (85%) compared to the other aldehydes. The fused aromatic
2-hydroxy naphthaldehyde gave a 96% yield within 1 h, and 2-methylindole
also reacted smoothly with all aldehyde derivatives, except for heterocyclic
1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole carboxaldehyde, which gave a
lower yield (83%).

The performance of PPy@CH2Br was
compared with that
of the reported catalysts for the synthesis of BIMs (Table 3). Recently, Wang and co-workers38 reported the use of graphene oxide for the synthesis
of BIMs in the presence of water. They used a large amount of catalyst
(150 mg) and used tedious flash chromatography for product isolation.
Sodium carbonate was also used for the synthesis of BIMs;39 however, harmful dichloromethane was used as
a cosolvent and flash chromatography was used for the separation of
the product. Sodium carbonate acts as an alkali because when dissolved
in water, it dissociates into the weak acid carbonic acid and the
strong alkali sodium hydroxide. Direct use of NaOH achieved an 85%
yield in 2 h.40 Kothandapani and co-worker
reported magnetically separable sulfonic acid (Fe3O4–OSO3H)-catalyzed one-pot synthesis of BIMs.41 Even though multistep synthesis of the catalyst
was involved, this catalyst gave stoichiometric yields of diverse
BIMs. Compared to the reported catalysts, the synthesis of PPy@CH2Br is straightforward, the catalyst gives high yield (96%)
in 1 h and is recyclable (vide infra), and laborious workup procedures
are not needed.

The
leaching components of the catalyst into the liquid medium
can be one of the crucial aspects regarding the deactivation of heterogeneous
catalysts in liquid media. There are several ways of accomplishing
the detection of the phenomenon of leaching, such as sampling of the
reaction liquid and chemical analysis, contacting the catalyst with
the reaction medium, activity measurement of the soluble species,
and careful characterization of the used solid. Here, we tested the
activity of the soluble species. The PPy@CH2Br catalyst
was separated out of the reactor by filtration after 20 min of reaction
during the synthesis of BIM 1 with the reaction conditions
given in entry 8 of Table 2. The reaction was kept for 4 h at 60 °C with the solution
mixture bearing no catalyst. The 55% yield obtained at 20 min of reaction
remained almost unchanged, that is, 56% after 3 h of reaction, demonstrating
that there was no remarkable leaching of active catalyst components.
The recyclability of PPy@CH2Br catalysis was also examined.
The catalyst was recovered by adding ethyl acetate (EA) (10 mL) to
the reaction mixture; the insoluble PPy@CH2Br was separated
by centrifugation, washed twice with EA (5 mL), and finally dried
under vacuum. The catalyst was recyclable up to five runs (Figure 4).The morphology
and chemical functionality of the recycled catalyst (see Figure S1, Supporting Information) were similar to those
of the fresh catalyst.

Figure 4 Effect of recycling the PPy@CH2Br catalyst
on the yield
of the compound 1.

The chemoselectivity of the reaction was also investigated.
Indole
(1 mmol) was reacted with benzaldehyde (0.6 mmol) in the presence
of acetophenone (0.6 mmol) at 60 °C for 5 h using 10 mg of the
PPy@CH2Br catalyst. The only product obtained was BIM 1 derived from benzaldehyde (96%), whereas BIM 1′ derived from acetophenone was not observed (Scheme 1). Standard free energies of formation (ΔGf°) of BIM 1 and BIM 1′ were computed each by a vibrational evaluation as
a function of temperature using DMol3 package. The calculations
for ΔGf° were performed using
the methodology of computing the total electronic energy of molecules
and their individual atomic constituents using the density functional
theory (DFT) method (BLPY).42 As shown
in Scheme 1, the resulting
computed ΔGf° values for BIM 1 and BIM 1′ are 24.69 and 38.46 kcal/mol,
respectively. The positive signs of the free energy indicate that
these reactions will not occur spontaneously at rt, and the ΔGf° value of BIM 1 is considerably
less than that of BIM 1′, indicating that BIM 1 must be formed first upon continuous reaction of a mixture
of 2 mol of indole and 1 mol of benzaldehyde and acetophenone.

Mechanistic Aspect of HCP-Catalyzed Synthesis of BIMs
To get insights on the driving force of the high efficiency of PPy@CH2Br-catalyzed synthesis of BIMs, the structure, electronic
properties, and chemical reactivity of pyrene, pyrene dimeric species,
and their derivatives bearing bromomethyl groups in different positions
and numbers were theoretically studied by using DFT calculations and
are illustrated in Figure 5. The energies of frontier orbitals, the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO), are also calculated, and the results are summarized in Table 4 together with computed
minimum energy values. Even though the PPy@CH2Br catalyst
contains a large number of CH2Br on the surface of the
highly cross-linked PPy matrix, the DFT studies may help to understand
the catalytic role of PPy@CH2Br. The ground-state geometry
optimizations of a pyrene molecule and its mono bromomethyl derivatives
1-(bromomethyl)pyrene (1-BrCPy), 2-(bromomethyl)pyrene (2-BrCPy),
and 4-(bromomethyl)pyrene (4-BrCPy) show that the computed minimum
energy is in the order of 2-BrCPy < 1-BrCPy < 4-BrCPy ≪
Py.

As shown in Figure 4, both HOMO and LUMO
are localized evenly on the entire pyrene and
1-BrCPy molecules. For 4-BrCPy, the HOMO spreads mainly on the Py
moiety, whereas the LUMO is evenly distributed to the entire molecule.
For 2-BrCPy, both HOMO and LUMO spread only on the Py moiety, not
the bromomethyl group. ESP-fitted charges of benzylic carbons for
1-BrCPy and 4-BrCPy are 0.792 and 0.796, respectively, and that for
2-BrCPy is 0.767. In addition, ESP-fitted charges of the two hydrogen
atoms on benzylic carbons are 0.291 and 0.291 for 1-BrCPy and 0.290
and 0.296 for 4-BrCPy, whereas they are 0.275 and 0.277 for 2-BrCPy.

These results demonstrate that the electrophilic substitution of
pyrene preferentially takes place at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 8-positions,
as reported based on both experimental result43 and DFT calculation.44 Both HOMO and
LUMO are localized evenly on the entire methylene-bridged pyrene dimer
(di(pyren-1-yl)methane; dPy) molecule like pyrene. For dPy bearing
a bromomethyl group, 1-(bromomethyl)-6-(pyren-1-ylmethyl)pyrene (BrC-dPy),
the HOMO spreads on entire molecules except for bromomethyl group,
whereas the distribution of the LUMO is about half of the BrCdPy molecule.
For the dPy derivatives bearing two and three bromomethyl groups,
1,3-bis(bromomethyl)-6-(pyren-1-ylmethyl)pyrene ((BrC)2dPy) and 1,3,6-tris(bromomethyl)-8-(pyren-1-ylmethyl)pyrene ((BrC)3dPy), respectively, HOMOs are mainly on the Py moieties bearing
no bromomethyl groups, whereas LUMOs are predominantly distributed
on the Py moieties bearing bromomethyl groups. In addition, the average
ESP-fitted charges of hydrogen atoms in the benzylic position of the
dPy derivatives are larger than those of monomeric BrCPy species,
suggesting that the dimeric species are more reactive for electrophilic
attack.

The HOMO/LUMO band gap can be used as a measure of chemical
reactivity
parameter. For example, chemical hardness (η = (ELUMO – EHOMO)/2), electronic
chemical potential (μ = −(ELUMO – EHOMO)/2), and electrophilicity
parameter (ω = μ2/2η) are useful parameters
to determine the relative stability and reactivity45,46 and are summarized in Table 4. For Py and its derivatives, the values of EHOMO decrease in the order Py > 2-BrCPy > 1-BrCPy
> 4-BrCPy,
whereas those of ELUMO decrease in the
order Py > 2-BrCPy > 4-BrCPy > 1-BrCPy. Thus, the band gap
decreases
in the order Py > 2-BrCPy > 4-BrCPy > 1-BrCPy. For dPy and
its derivatives,
the values of both EHOMO and ELUMO decrease as the number of bromomethyl substituents
increases. Thus, the same trend is seen for the band gap. Chemical
hardness (η) measures the resistance of a compound to electron
charge transfer.44 From Table 4, 1-BrCPy from monomeric species
and (BrC)3dPy from dimeric species have the lowest η
values, and therefore they are the most soft and the most reactive
compounds in each series. The similar interpretation is possible with
the value of ω, since the smaller the value of the more stable
is the compound.47 The value measures the
capacity of a species to accept electrons. Thus, 4-BrCPy is the strongest
nucleophile, whereas 1-BrCPy is the strongest electrophile among monomeric
Py species bearing a bromomethyl group. The electrophilicity increases
as the number of bromomethyl groups increases among dPy derivatives.
Thus, it is safe to assume that as the number of bromomethyl groups
increases, the number of active sites and the electrophilicity of
the hydrogen atoms on the benzylic positions increase, which influences
the catalytic activity in an affirmative way.

Considering the
experimental results and DFT calculations of the
model compounds, a plausible mechanism for the PPy@CH2Br-catalyzed
synthesis of BIMs can be proposed, as shown in Scheme 2. In the initial step, benzylic hydrides
on PPy@CH2Br activate the carbonyl group of the aldehyde,
making it liable to attack by indole. The nucleophilic attack of indole
to the activated carbonyl compound leads to the formation of an intermediate,
which undergoes elimination of water to form another intermediate.
The second molecule of indole then reacts with this intermediate,
which undergoes aromatization to form the BIM.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism
for the Synthesis of BIMs in the Presence of PPy@CH2Br
or PPhn@CH2Br as a Catalyst
Conclusions
Highly stable and reusable heterogeneous
organocatalysts were synthesized
by Friedel–Crafts bromomethylation of Phn and Py, followed
by self-polymerization of bromomethylated Phn and Py. The resultant
microspheres were intrinsically decorated with unreacted bromomethyl
groups on the surface. Using the electrophilicity of the benzylic
hydride, they were used as catalysts for the synthesis of a variety
of BIM compounds including 12 new compounds. All compounds were obtained
in 83–96% yield under neat conditions at 60 °C. The PPy@CH2Br- or PPhn@CH2Br-catalyzed protocol provided clean
reaction profiles based on readily available starting materials. The
easy preparation route, low toxicity, and recyclability of PPy@CH2Br and PPhn@CH2Br catalysts coupled to an atom-economic
reaction, and the use of neat condition is a feature that makes this
new HCP-based protocol a green alternative for the synthesis of BIMs.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Anhydrous zinc bromide (ZnBr2,
98%, Acros), iron trichloride (FeCl3, 99%, Daejung Chemicals,
Seoul, Korea), BMME (>95%, TCI), dimethoxymethane (>95%, TCI),
and
the aromatic hydrocarbons Phn (98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and Py (>98%,
TCI)
were used as received without further purification. DCE (>99%,
Daejung
Chem. Co., Seoul, Korea) was distilled before use. Indole, 2-methylindole,
and various other aromatic aldehydes were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Instrumentation and Measurements
The FTIR spectra were
recorded on a Shimadzu IRPrestige 21 spectrometer at rt. The samples
were measured as KBr discs in the range of 4500–500 cm–1. XRD was used to determine the crystallinity of the
electrode materials on an automatic Philips powder diffractometer
with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation. The XRD patterns were
recorded from 10° to 80°. The morphology, size, and microstructure
of the products were investigated by SEM (S-3000 and SU-70, Hitachi).
The BET and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda methods (NOVA
3200e system, Quantachrome Instrument, USA) were employed to investigate
the BET specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples. 1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were
recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 NMR spectrometer at rt. The chemical
shifts of the protons were relative to tetramethylsilane (Me4Si). The data are presented as follows: chemical shift (ppm), multiplicity
(s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet), and coupling
constant J (Hz). The elemental analysis of the BIMs
was performed with an Elementar Vario EL III element analyzer (Elementar
Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany) for C, H, N, and S determination at
Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan, Korea).

Computational Details
The all-electron DFT calculations
were carried out using the DMol3 code48 included in the Accelrys Materials Studio package.49 ESP-fitted charges were obtained from DFT calculations.
A DNP basis set was employed in all calculations, and the PBE exchange–correlation
functional was used.50 The DMol3 code uses the ESP method as proposed by Singh and Kollman.51 In the DMol3 code, the default grid
spacing corresponds to 0.5 Å. Default settings were used in all
calculations.

Synthesis of Hyper-Cross-Linked PPhn and
PPy Microspherical
Particles
Anhydrous ZnBr2 (1.3 g, 5.7 mmol) and
Phn (1 g, 5.6 mmol) were dissolved in 50 mL of DCE in a 100 mL flask,
and BMME (1.4 g, 11.2 mmol) was added to the solution under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The mixture was stirred for 18 h at 70 °C. Insoluble
and spherical PPhn particles started to form after 10 min of reaction.
The resulting microspherical polymer was washed thoroughly with water
and methanol. Extraction was performed with methanol using a Soxhlet
extractor for 24 h, and the sample was subsequently collected and
dried overnight under vacuum at 60 °C. Because the resultant
sample bears unreacted bromo methylene groups on the surface, we define
this sample as PPhn@CH2Br. The PPy@CH2Br sphere
was also synthesized by a similar procedure. The bromine content of
the unreacted part (−CH2Br) was determined by calorimetry.52 The PPy@CH2OMe sphere bearing unreacted
methoxy methyl groups instead of bromomethyl groups was synthesized
also by a similar procedure using dimethoxymethane as a cross-linker
and FeCl3 as a catalyst.

General Procedure of Synthesis
of BIMs
In a 10 mL reaction
flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 10 mg of PPhn@CH2Br or PPy@CH2Br spheres was added to a mixture
of indole, 2-methylindole (1 mmol), and aldehyde (0.6 mmol). The resulting
reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C until the completion of
the reaction was indicated by thin-layer chromatography. Subsequently,
the product was dissolved with 10 mL of EA, and the insoluble HCP
could be separated by centrifugation. The solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure, and the solid residue was washed with ether and
recrystallized from methanol to afford the desired product. The separated
HCP was washed twice with EA (5 mL) and then dried under vacuum before
reuse. All previously known products afforded spectral and physical
data consistent with those reported in the literature. The new products
were characterized by their melting points and IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectra and elemental analysis. The detailed descriptions
of the reaction times, yields, melting points, and spectral data for
the new compounds are given below, whereas those of the known compounds
are given in the Supporting Information.
