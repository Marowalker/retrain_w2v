We
report on the highly sensitive optical and colorimetric detection
of perfluorinated compounds in the vapor phase achieved by all-polymer
dielectric mirrors. High optical quality and uniformly distributed
Bragg reflectors were fabricated by alternating thin films of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) and Hyflon AD polymers as high and low
refractive index medium, respectively. A new processing procedure
has been developed to compatibilize the deposition of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) with the highly solvophobic Hyflon AD
polymer layers to achieve mutual processability between the two polymers
and fabricate the devices. As a proof of principle, sensing measurements
were performed using the Galden HT55 polymer as a prototype of the
perfluorinated compound. The Bragg stacks show a strong chromatic
response upon exposure to this compound, clearly detectable as both
spectral and intensity variations. Conversely, Bragg mirrors fabricated
without fluorinated polymers do not show any detectable response,
demonstrating that the Hyflon AD polymer acts as the active and selective
medium for sensing perfluorinated species. These results demonstrate
that organic dielectric mirrors containing perfluorinated polymers
can represent an innovative colorimetric monitoring system for fluorinated
compounds, suitable to improve both environmental safety and quality
of life.

Introduction
Nowadays, fluorinated
products and polymers offer a wide range
of materials with outstanding performances and technological solutions
for high demanding applications. These applications very often constitute
challenges in many key sectors like automotive, aeronautics, healthcare,
energy, storage, and many others. Properties related to performances
may include chemical inertness, thermal resistance, abrasion and weathering
protection, water and stain repellency, biocompatibility, transparency,
and many others.1,2 Usually, these materials are soluble
only in expensive fluorinated solvents, whereas their nonwettability
prevents the adhesion of overcoatings and makes them difficult to
manage together with nonfluorinated compounds. Moreover, the detection
of perfluorinated molecules (PFCs) is an important task, which makes
any progress to increase the capability to assess the presence of
these molecules highly interesting to monitor and preserve environmental
health and safety. In this respect, a simple method for the assessment
of air containing volatile PFCs using cost-effective sensors is of
great importance. Optical and chromatic measurements constitute a
class among simple methods and has been demonstrated in a variety
of structures including molecular systems,3 photonic crystals,4,5 and liquid crystalline nanostructures.6−8 In particular, polymer dielectric mirrors (or distributed Bragg
reflectors, DBR) proved to be a reliable and low-cost platform for
colorimetric sensing for both organic and inorganic analytes in the
vapor phase.9−13 These devices are made of polymer layers having a different refractive
index periodically alternated to generate dielectric submicrometric
lattices. The interaction between light and these dielectric lattices,
which are also known as monodimensional or planar photonic crystals,
induces frequency regions forbidden to photon propagation. These frequencies
are called photonic band gaps (PBGs) and are detectable as bright
colors with the naked eyes, and as maxima of reflectance in the DBR
spectrum. Polymer-DBR sensors are based on the intercalation of an
analyte within the polymer layers. This process swells the polymers
increasing their thickness, and thus, affecting the dielectric lattice.
Such swelling is reflected in the DBR spectra as a shift of the PBG.
The overall process can be driven by several analyte–polymer
interaction mechanisms. For instance, the kinetics of intercalation
of an analyte within the polymer DBR can be engineered by modifying
the free volume between the polymer chains using nanocomposite structures.2 Another mechanism exploits the formation of the
guest-induced crystalline clathrate domains in amorphous polymers.
This mechanism, combined with different chemical affinity for different
polymer–analyte pairs, plays a role in label-free molecular
recognition.4 Because the interaction between
the analyte and the polymers was demonstrated to be critical to govern
the sensitivity and the selectivity of the DBR sensors, here, we propose
the use of a perfluorinated polymer (PFC-P, copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene
and 2,2,4-trifluoro-5-trifluoromethoxy 1,3-dioxole, known commercially
as the Hyflon AD polymer, by Solvay Specialty Polymers) for the detection
of PFCs. In addition to its affinity for PFCs, this polymer possesses
a very low refractive index (∼1.33), which allows a remarkable
increase in the dielectric contrast with respect to polymer pairs
commonly used to grow DBRs. Indeed, this parameter usually suffers
from drawbacks related to the polymer mutual processability connected
to the requirement for high transparency.14 The large dielectric contrast implies that high reflectance values
can be obtained using a relatively small number of bilayers, thus,
saving materials and making the device fabrication faster.14 However, as any other PFC, these polymers are
highly solvophobic and scarcely wettable. This implies low mutual
processability with other polymers. As a consequence, despite their
optical transparency and low refractive index, very few examples of
DBRs made of PFC-P have been reported in the literature so far.15−18

In this work, we take advantage of our expertize in processing
PFC-P19,20 to design and fabricate relatively homogeneous
and large area Hyflon AD polymers (HY):poly(N-vinylcarbazole)
(PVK) DBRs as a proof of concept sensing devices. Galden HT55, perfluoropolyether
polymer, was used as a prototype analyte of PFCs. Our results offer
a simple colorimetric detection of PFCs in the vapor phase for the
first time, suggesting a new and simple approach to easy environmental
detection of PFCs.

Results and Discussion
Due to low
surface energy and solvophobicity, it is difficult to
implement HY films into multilayered structures. Indeed, for the growth
of DBRs, the deposition of polymer thin films need a tight control
of thickness and interface roughness, which should not exceed few
nanometers over large areas.21 To make
HY layers suitable for the deposition of PVK films, their surface
was activated by room temperature plasma treatment. Such treatment
results in improved adhesion properties.22−24 To develop
a routine for HY activation, we tested plasmas with different O2/N2 ratios.19 The surface
activation was assessed by water contact angle measurements for over
24 h after the plasma treatment. Figure 1 reports the contact angles measured before
and after the treatments. Before the treatment (black dot in Figure 1), the sample shows
a contact angle of 119 ± 1°. Supporting Information Figure S1 reports the value collected for nine
sample cast using different conditions, demonstrating the reliability
of the growth procedure. Upon surface treatment, the contact angle
dramatically decreases to an upper value of ∼103° for
O2 plasma, and a lower value of 97° for air-plasma
(colored dots in Figure 1). N2 and different O2/N2 mixtures
induce instead contact angles between these limit values. The surface
activation was then monitored for 24 h by storing the samples in a
petri dish in room conditions without any specific precaution. The
data in Figure 1 show
that only small variations occur when the samples are treated with
all the gas mixtures but air, where the contact angle further decreases
over the 24 h. These results indicate that the surface of the HY film
remains wettable over time, suitable for the preparation of multilayered
structures. In this regard, N2 plasma induces the lowest
contact angle stable on the longer time scale, and was then employed
as routine treatment during the DBR fabrication.25

Supporting Information Figure S1 (black
dot), and after 0, 1, 4, and 24 h since the plasma treatment with
different O2/N2 mixtures (colored dots).

DBRs were then grown on 1 in.2
glass substrate starting from the
deposition of a PVK layer. After PVK deposition and thermal annealing,
a layer of HY was cast on the latter and the surface activation was
performed. This operation was repeated seven times to grow the multilayer. Figure 2a,b show the photographs
and Figure 2c shows
the spectra of a DBR sample resulting from this routine. Figure 2a displays the sample
as cast on the glass substrate, which appears blue and highly relatively homogeneous. The photograph in Figure 2b reports instead a similar sample after
peeling-off from the substrate. The Figures demonstrate that highly homogeneous, free-standing, and flexible DBRs can
be fabricated with the method we propose. The DBR homogeneity was
also confirmed by the reflectance spectra of the sample collected
over six different spots of its surface. Indeed, Figure 2c shows that the peak intensity
and spectral position oscillates within 2 and 4%, respectively. The
spectra also show a well-defined interference pattern in the background,
demonstrating very high quality of the top and bottom surfaces of
the sample.2 The spectra show a prominent
reflectance peak at ∼900 nm assigned to the PBG and a second
order diffraction peak at ∼450 nm, responsible for the brilliant
blue color observed in the pictures reported in Figure 2a,b. The very high reflectance intensity
of the PBG is due to the large dielectric contrast achieved with HY
and PVK, which is the largest reported so far for polymer DBR grown
by commercial polymers.7 The experimental
spectra can be nicely reproduced with those calculated via a transfer
matrix method (dashed black line in Figure 2c)26,27 using layer thicknesses dHy = 102 ± 4 nm and dPVK = 196 ± 3 nm and refractive index values dHy = 1.3328 for HY and nPVK as retrieved in previously published data.26 The thickness uncertainty is comparable to the
interlayer roughness investigated in a previous work by X-ray reflectivity.21

Figure 2 (a, b) Photographs and (c) experimental (continuous lines)
and
calculated (dashed line) reflectance spectra of HY:PVK DBR.

The sensitivity of the HY:PVK
DBRs to fluorinated compounds was
assessed exposing the sample to the Galden HT55 polymer for 100 min. Figure 3a displays the contour
plot of the reflectance spectra collected as a function of the exposure
time. Here, the PBG is observed in red tones, whereas the spectra
background is in blue shades. In the initial stages of exposure, the
first and second order PBGs are detected at 900 and 450 nm respectively.
These spectral features remain unchanged for the first 20 min. According
to models reported in a previous work,2 this induction time is assigned to the analyte permeation across
the first PVK layer and can be increased or decreased, changing its
thickness. To demonstrate this statement, Supporting Information Figure S2 shows that when the DBR is capped with
HY layers instead of PVK, the induction time is reduced within the
time resolution of our system (few milliseconds). After the induction
time, the DBR spectrum undergoes a dramatic change. The first order
PBG quickly fades while shifting toward longer wavelengths. Upon 50
min of exposure, it is shifted at about 1100 nm. Upon longer exposures,
the feature keeps shifting deeper in the near infrared part of the
spectrum and inhomogeneously broadens. This behavior occurs until
90 min of exposure, when the PBG intensity decreases, and the feature
cannot be distinguished clearly from the background of the spectrum
anymore. The spectral details of the optical response of bare and
long time exposed DBRs are reported in Supporting Information Figure S3. These characteristics have already
been observed for different analyte/all-polymer DBR systems,2,4 and are assigned to the large intake of the analyte, which largely
swells the active polymer, until the order and the periodicity of
the sample get destroyed and the reflectance intensity of the PBG
is dramatically reduced. Concerning the second order PBG, at 450 nm,
the glass substrate and the PVK absorptions reduce the effects of
the analyte intercalation in the optical response. The diffraction
peak remains indeed unchanged for about 20 min of exposure, and then
its intensity fades indicating the loss of periodicity order of the
structure. The behavior just observed can be interpreted considering
a progressive intercalation of the analyte through the DBR surface
closer to the enriched environment,2 and
thus, a progressive and inhomogeneous swelling of the HY layers starting
from the one on the top of the DBR, which is closer to the analyte
environment, to the bottom one, which is closer to the glass substrate.
Under this assumption, we simulated the optical response of the sample
after 80 min of exposure considering the DBR layers to be closer to
the unswollen substrate, and a random normal distribution of the thicknesses
of the upper HY layers (295 ± 133 nm, see Supporting Information Figure S3 for details). The good agreement between
the experimental and calculated spectra (Supporting Information Figure S3) confirms the hypothesis that the analyte
intercalation generates a giant swelling of the HY layers combined
with a great amount of disorder. These data also agree with our previous
findings on different all-polymer DBR exposed to selected analytes,
and suggest that HY-based sensing devices may be suitable to reveal
and discriminate different vapor analytes with a lower detection limit
at the ppm level and sensitivity of ppb.2,4

Figure 3 Contour plot of the (a)
HY:PVK and (b) cellulose acetate (CA):PVK
DBR spectra collected during the exposure to Galden HT55 polymer saturated
vapors.

To prove the role of HY in the
detection of the perfluorinated
compounds, we compared the response to perfluorinated analytes of
CA:PVK DBRs, which are known to be very efficient in the analysis
of aromatic, heteroaromatic, or alcoholic species and water.2,4,6Figure 3b shows the response of CA:PVK DBR to Galden
HT55 polymer vapors. No effects, even minor, are observed on the spectral
position and the intensity of the PBGs over 100 min of exposure. This
demonstrates that the fluorinated analyte does not interact with the
CA and PVK.

The analysis of the combined optical response to
Galden vapors
clearly indicates that only the presence of a perfluorinated polymer
like the Hyflon AD polymer in the DBR allows the detection of the
PFC analytes as sketched in Figure 4. Here, the fluorinated Hy films undergoes strong swelling
upon intercalation of Galden HT55 (Figure 4a), inducing a strong bathochromic shift
of the PBG spectral position observed in Figure 3a. Conversely, when CA is used as a low index
medium, the chemico-physical interaction between the fluorinated analytes
and the hydrogen-based polymer forbid the polymer swelling, and thus,
the optical response (Figures 3c and 4b). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first report on optical detection of fluorinated persistent
volatile species by polymer photonic crystals.

of the sensing principle: (a) HY:PVK and
(b) CA:PVK DBR exposed to Galden HT55. PVK is represented in yellow,
CA in gray, and Hy in green. Galden HT55 representation is purely
indicative.

Finally, we would like
to comment on the design of the DBR sensor.
Commonly, DBRs applied to photonics for lasing or for light emission
control are designed to have layer thicknesses d1n1 = d2n2 = λPBG/4,29,30 where, n is the refractive index of each layer
and λPBG is the PBG spectral position. Such values
satisfy the lambda fourth conditions,31 where the even orders of diffraction are not detectable in the DBR
spectra, and odd PBGs with the highest reflectance and widest full
width half maximum are achieved. However, high reflectance and bandwidth
hinder the detection of small spectral variation.6 Besides this aspect, as previously reported by this group,2,4 the presence of a second order PBG tuned in the visible part of
the spectrum and coupled with a first order PBG tuned in the near
infrared region allows slower, and thus, more sensitive responses
due to the first order of diffraction. Nevertheless, the colorimetric
response due to the second order is maintained, allowing both simple
ON/OFF colorimetric detection and quantitative assessment of fluorinated
chemical species.

This work represents a proof of concept for
easy chromatic detection
of novel relevant analytes. However, a deeper investigation of the
figures of merit of the sensors, including the lower detection limit,
sensitivity, and selectivity is necessary to develop disposable sensors
easy to operate even without the use of a spectrometer by untrained
users. Indeed, analyte intercalation through the polymer films induces
a dramatic color change due to the PBG bathochromic shift. Then a
chemically switchable ON/OFF system can also be engineered. Moreover,
polymer DBRs are currently the only photonic crystals industrially
fabricable on the square meter scale by available technology already
used for food packaging, like co-extrusion or continuous melting.
These features, joined with the size of the present sensors, which
is down to few square millimeters, make low-cost disposable sensors
highly interesting.

Conclusions
We demonstrated the
fabrication of flexible and high quality all-polymer
DBR sensors with an area of 1 in.2 made by HY, a perfluorinated copolymer
with a very low refractive index, and the high refractive index PVK,
using a simple and cost-effective technique as spin-coating. The high
dielectric contrast achieved using these polymers allows very high
reflectance with less than 10 bilayers, thus, achieving highly sensitive
DBR sensors with a remarkable material saving. These DBRs show an
outstanding optical response to fluorinated species in the vapor phase.
For this purpose, the Galden HT55 polymer as a test molecule was used
to demonstrate for the first time that the PFCs can be easily and
selectively detected even by an untrained user and without complicated
laboratory equipment by a label-free photonic crystal. These characteristics
together with the possibility of mass production by established technologies,
provide a new class of disposable and functional polymer photonic
structures. Such DBR can be used to improve environmental safety and
human quality of life.

Experimental Section
The DBR sensors
were cast by spin-coating using PVK (Sigma-Aldrich, Mw = 135 000) as a high refractive index
material and HY as a low refractive index material. To demonstrate
the sensing mechanism, some reference sensors were also fabricated
replacing HY with cellulose acetate (CA, Sigma-Aldrich, Mn = 50 000) as the low index medium as reported
in previous works.27,32−35 PVK was dissolved in toluene
(35 g/L),26 CA was dissolved in 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone
(36 g/L), and HY was dissolved in the Galden HT110 polymer (30–42
g/L). Polymer solutions were then spun-cast at a rotation speed between
20 and 120 revolutions per second to obtain thicknesses in the range
100–200 nm. Due to the low surface energy of HY, after the
deposition of each HY layer, low power O2–N2 mixtures vacuum plasma treatment (15 W, 30 s) was performed
to improve PVK adhesion by using a Gambetti Colibri system.19 After deposition of each PVK layer, thermal
annealing at 80° C for 45 s was performed.

The sensitivity
of the DBR sensors to PCFs was assessed by exposing
them to a saturated environment of the Galden HT55 polymer (Pvapor = 0.27 kPa) and monitoring their dynamic
spectral response. Reflectance spectra were collected with homemade
setups previously described4 using an aluminum
mirror as a reference. For this reason, the reflectance intensity
(and not absolute reflectivity) can be slightly higher than 100%.
Contact angles have been measured by a Theta Lite optical tensiometer
by Biolin Scientific36 using the sessile
drop technique.37
