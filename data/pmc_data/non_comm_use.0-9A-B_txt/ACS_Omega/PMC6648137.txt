The water splitting activity of hematite
is sensitive to the film
processing parameters due to limiting factors such as a short hole
diffusion length, slow oxygen evolution kinetics, and poor light absorptivity.
In this work, we use direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering as a
fast and cost-effective route to deposit metallic iron thin films,
which are annealed in air to obtain well-adhering hematite thin films
on F:SnO2-coated glass substrates. These films are compared
to annealed hematite films, which are deposited by reactive radio
frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering, which is usually used for depositing
metal oxide thin films, but displays an order of magnitude lower deposition
rate. We find that DC sputtered films have much higher photoelectrochemical
activity than reactive RF sputtered films. We show that this is related
to differences in the morphology and surface composition of the films
as a result of the different processing parameters. This in turn results
in faster oxygen evolution kinetics and lower surface and bulk recombination
effects. Thus, fabricating hematite thin films by fast and cost-efficient
metallic iron deposition using DC magnetron sputtering is shown to
be a valid and industrially relevant route for hematite photoanode
fabrication.

Introduction
Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting has emerged as an attractive
route for environmentally friendly generation of chemical fuels, also
known as “solar fuels”.1 The
appeal of this strategy arises due to the need for an efficient, large-scale
storage of solar energy to fulfill the aim of a future low-carbon
energy economy. However, to compete with other hydrogen generation
techniques, such as methane steam reforming and electrolysis of water,
PEC water splitting has to be made more efficient. The main reason
for the limited efficiency is the four-electron oxygen evolution reaction
(OER), which is kinetically challenging compared to the two-electron
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, development of efficient,
stable, inexpensive, and abundant photoanodes that show high O2 production is a significant bottleneck for developing a viable
PEC system.2−4

Since the first demonstration of an operating
PEC cell in 1972
utilizing TiO2,5 many other
materials have been studied for their suitability as a photoanode.
Of these, hematite (α-Fe2O3) remains one
of the most widely studied materials for oxygen evolution reaction
due to an optimum band gap (2–2.2 eV), excellent chemical stability,
nontoxicity, abundance, and low cost.4,6−8 The band gap of hematite ideally provides a theoretical solar-to-hydrogen
(STH) efficiency of 12–16%.9 Yet,
the highest reported experimental STH efficiency for a hematite-based
device is 3.4% in tandem with a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell.10 This
discrepancy in efficiency stems from the intrinsic material properties
of hematite, such as poor light absorptivity due to an indirect band
gap transition, short minority carrier lifetime (10 ps), and low minority
charge carrier mobility (0.2 cm2 V–1 s–1), leading to a short hole diffusion length of ca.
2–4 nm.4,11 This leads to a large mismatch
in the requirements for the film thickness, with around 400 nm required
for complete light absorption (for light with a wavelength below 700
nm)12,13 on the one hand, and less than 20 nm for
efficient hole collection4 on the other
hand. Nanostructuring of hematite improves the performance compared
to planar thin films,14 but also increases
the complexity of understanding the effect of film deposition and
processing parameters on the PEC activity. Thus, in this work, hematite
thin films are used since they provide an ideal system to study the
impact of processing parameters on physical and chemical properties,
which are related to changes in the PEC processes during OER.

Various physical and chemical synthesis techniques have been used
to obtain efficient hematite photoanodes, such as sputtering,15−17 atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD),7 atomic layer deposition (ALD),18 ultrasonic spray pyrolysis,19 and hydrothermal synthesis.20 In the
case of sputtering, hematite films are usually deposited either from
a ceramic hematite target using a radio frequency (RF) power source15,16 or from a metallic iron target in a reactive oxygen ambient using
direct current (DC)21 or RF17 power sources. Sputtering from metal oxide targets
and reactive sputtering processes are known to suffer from rather
low deposition rates. DC magnetron sputtering from an iron target
and subsequent annealing to iron oxide offer various advantages. Deposition
rates of up to 3 Å s–1 are achieved in this
work for the sputtered Fe films, which is an order of magnitude faster
than typical RF sputtering processes from a ceramic target15 or reactive RF sputtering from an iron target.17 DC sputtering is also up to 3 orders of magnitude
faster than ALD22 while offering comparable
control over deposition parameters. Thus, reproducible thin films
with only minor variations in film properties between different batches
can be obtained quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, DC sputtering
is safer than chemical deposition processes, such as APCVD and spray
pyrolysis, which use toxic precursors. Thus, DC magnetron sputtering
offers a safe, cost-effective, and scalable deposition process for
thin-film fabrication at an industrial scale.

In this work,
we therefore use DC magnetron sputtering to deposit
Fe thin films and transform them by subsequent annealing to hematite.
We compare the PEC behavior of the DC sputtered films to hematite
layers obtained by reactive RF sputtering, which is the standard method
of fabricating metal oxide thin films, but is a much slower process
as discussed above. Extensive physical and electrochemical characterization
of these thin films allows us to relate the variation in the physicochemical
properties as a result of changes in the sputtering process to the
differences in the PEC activity.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Properties
Pure hematite phase is identified
from the structural characterization of both the DC and RF sputtered
thin films after annealing by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
(GI-XRD)15,21 (Figure 1). Both films are polycrystalline in nature, but differences
in the crystallographic orientation in the DC and RF films are seen.
While the ratio of the (110) peak to the (104) peak of unoriented,
polycrystalline hematite (ICDD catalogue number: 33-0664) is 1.429,
it is seen to be 2.168 for the DC film and 0.98 for the RF film. This
indicates a preferential growth of the hematite grains in the [104]
direction for DC and in the [110] direction for RF sputtered films.
It is known from the literature16 that
the electron mobility in hematite films is highly anisotropic and
the mobility along the (001) basal plane is up to 4 orders of magnitude
higher than in the perpendicular planes. This would suggest that the
RF film with a higher (110) peak intensity will have a higher conductivity
in the direction normal to the film compared to the DC film. This
should help facilitate the charge carrier transport between the hematite–electrolyte
interface and the FTO substrate in the RF film. It should be noted
that in grazing incidence configuration, the preferred orientation
for grains at angles equivalent to the incident angle (0.5° in
our case) is determined. Hence, the texture of the film nearly parallel
to the film surface is observed, but a quantitative analysis of the
overall texture of the hematite thin film is not possible with this
technique.

Figure 1 GI-XRD diffractograms of (a) DC and (b) RF sputtered hematite thin
films after annealing. Peaks corresponding to the different crystallographic
orientations for α-Fe2O3 (ICDD catalog
number: 33-064) are represented by blue lines in the spectra and are
labeled. The peaks corresponding to the FTO substrate are represented
as “S” in the spectra.

Thin-Film Morphology
The top-view morphologies of a
DC sputtered 20 nm thick iron film and an RF sputtered 50 nm thick
iron oxide film before annealing are illustrated in Figure 2a,b, respectively. Both DC
and RF films look similar prior to annealing, showing a rough morphology
similar to that of the underlying FTO (see Figure S1a in the Supporting Information). In both the cases, loosely
packed grains are observed with large variation in both shape and
size (40–200 nm).

Figure 2 Top-view SEM images of (a) DC and (b) RF sputtered
films before
annealing and (c) DC and (d) RF sputtered films after annealing in
air.

After annealing, the DC and RF
films demonstrate different morphologies.
The DC film (Figure 2c), which converts from iron to hematite, undergoes a dramatic change
in morphology. The film shows closely packed grains of 30–50
nm size with no voids between the grains and an underlying, large-scale
morphology due to the FTO substrate. In contrast, the RF film (Figure 2d), which was already
deposited as iron oxide (see Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information), displays only minor variations in its
morphology with slight coarsening of grains as well as disappearance
of smaller (<50 nm) grains. The grains are still loosely packed
with voids present between them.

The effect of the different
sputtering techniques on the morphology
of the thin films is further explored with cross-sectional high-angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM)
(Figure 3). The DC
film (Figure 3a) has
a thickness of 40 ± 4 nm after annealing (see also Figure S1d). Hence, the thickness increases by
100%, which is due to the uptake of oxygen during annealing and the
difference in density between Fe (7.86 g cm–3) and
α-Fe2O3 (5.26 g cm–3). The DC film consists of closely packed grains grown on top of
the FTO layer, as seen in the top-view SEM image (Figure 2c). The grain sizes are similar
to the film thickness and extend through the entire thickness of the
film. Furthermore, voids are observed at some positions at the interface
between hematite and FTO (marked “i” in Figure 3a), which is attributed to
the roughness of the FTO layer.

Figure 3 HAADF-STEM images of the (a) DC and (b)
RF sputtered iron oxide
thin films. All images were taken after annealing in air at 645 °C
for 10 min. Pt and C layers were deposited using EBID to protect the
iron oxide layer during sample preparation for TEM analysis. The yellow
dotted lines are added as visual guidelines to demarcate the Fe2O3 layer. The red dotted circles indicate pinholes
and voids.

On the other hand, the thickness
of the RF sputtered α-Fe2O3 film does
not change during annealing, having
a final thickness of 47 ± 6 nm (Figures 3b and S1e), which
is similar to the sputtered thickness. The discontinuous hematite
layer grows as separate grains on top of the FTO grains and are separated
by large pinholes (marked “ii” in Figure 3b). Furthermore, the TEM images show the
presence of voids within the hematite grains themselves, which could
not be observed by SEM imaging (marked “iii” in Figure 3b).

To understand
the formation of these voids within the grains of
the RF film, the changes occurring in the film morphology and crystal
structure during annealing were studied (see Figures S1b,c and S2, respectively). From Figure S1b (which is a higher-magnification image of the RF film shown
in Figure 2b), we observe
that the RF film is sputtered as grains of size 40–200 nm.
However, each grain consists of smaller nucleates of size 5–10
nm. After annealing, these nucleates grow and merge, leading to the
formation of smoother grains, as observed in Figures S1c and 2d. Thus, one factor behind the formation of the voids
is the merging of these nucleates when the RF film is annealed.

Another factor is the change in the hematite crystal structure
on annealing, as shown in the XRD spectra in Figure S2. The peaks corresponding to the (104) and (110) orientation
of the reactive RF sputtered hematite are observed to increase in
intensity and decrease in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM). The
increase in peak intensity is attributed to increased crystallinity
of the film, while reduced FWHM values represent an increase in the
crystallite size (also observed as the coarsening of the grains in Figure S1c). Furthermore, a shift of the hematite
peaks to higher 2θ values is observed. The shift in the peak
position occurs due to a change in the lattice constants of the hematite
crystal structure. Hematite crystallizes in a rhombohedral corundum
structure23 and has a hexagonal unit cell
with lattice constants “a” and “c”. Annealing leads to a reduction in these lattice
constants (see the Supporting Information), which could also lead to the coalescence of vacancies within the
thin film and hence the formation of the voids. Evidently, the manner
in which the hematite film growth occurs during reactive RF sputtering
and its evolution during annealing lead to the formation of voids
within the RF thin film.

Surface Composition
The surface
compositions of the
DC and RF sputtered hematite films were measured and analyzed by XPS
(Figure 4). The fitting
of the O 1s spectra for the DC and the RF films results in three peaks.
The peak at 530 ± 0.15 eV is assigned to hematite lattice oxygen.24 The second peak at 531.6 ± 0.1 eV is related
to either hydroxyl species (OH–) or oxygen vacancies
(Vo..) at the surface.25 The third peak at 532.6 ± 0.1 eV is attributed to adsorbed
organic compounds, such as CO and CHO.26 The peak intensity ratio of the O lattice peak and the OH–/ Vo.. peak for the RF film was found to be
2.6 times lower compared to the DC film. These findings prove that
the surface composition for hematite thin films varies depending on
the sputtering route, with the RF film exhibiting a higher amount
of either hydroxyl species or oxygen vacancies at the surface.

Figure 4 O 1s peak spectra
and identified peak fits for (a) DC and (b) RF
films. The black line is the measured spectrum, and the red line is
the fitted curve; the magenta, blue, and green lines represent the
individual peak fits. Peak fitting parameters are obtained from Beisinger
et al.23

This observation is supported by the peak fitting results
of the
Fe 2p3/2 spectra (Figure S3)
using the XPS parameters for α-Fe2O3,
as proposed by Biesinger et al.25 It is
observed that the fitting for the DC film is better than that for
the RF film based on the standard deviation values. However, a deviation
of the fit from the spectra is seen in the peak fitting at lower binding
energies (709–710 eV) and is especially pronounced for the
RF film. This is attributed to the presence of another species at
the surface, such as a defective oxide (due to oxygen vacancies) or
an oxy-hydroxide species. From the O 1s spectra, it is evident that
the aforementioned species are present for both films but in larger
quantities at the surface of the RF film compared to the DC film.
Quantification of the exact type and amount of mixed species present
at the film surface by fitting of the Fe 2p3/2 spectra
is complicated due to spectral overlap, resulting in a larger degree
of fitting error and, as such, is beyond the scope of this article.

Optical Properties
The optical absorption coefficient
and band gap calculation for the DC and RF thin films are illustrated
in Figure S4a,b, respectively. The absorption
coefficient is calculated by normalizing the absorption spectra to
the film thickness obtained from cross-sectional HAADF-STEM (Figure 3). RF films have
a lower absorption coefficient in the entire wavelength range compared
to DC films. This is related to the presence of voids and pinholes
in the RF film, thus leading to less material that can absorb light.
The indirect optical band gap is 2.1 eV for both the DC and RF films,
which is similar to literature values.4,6

Photoelectrochemical
Behavior
Figure 5 shows the current density versus applied
potential (J–V) characteristics
of the DC and RF thin films annealed in air at 645 °C. The effect
of varying annealing temperatures on the PEC behavior of the DC and
RF films is summarized in Figure S5 in
the Supporting Information. Figure 5 shows that the dark current (dotted lines) for both
the DC and RF sputtered film remains negligible until 1.5 V versus
RHE. The onset potential, Vonset, for
the DC film is 0.88 V versus RHE, compared to the Vonset of 1.22 V versus RHE observed for the RF film. A
higher onset potential (ΔVonset)
is related to slower OER kinetics and higher recombination in the
RF film; this is discussed in detail in the next sections.

Figure 5 Current density
versus applied potential (J–V) curves for DC (red) and RF (black) thin films annealed
in air at 645 °C for 10 min. All measurements are done in 1 M
NaOH in the dark (dotted lines) or under an illumination intensity
of 100 mW cm–2 (solid lines). The arrows represent
the direction of the CV cycle and is the same for all measurements.

The DC film demonstrates a photocurrent
of 0.36 mA cm–2 at 1.5 V versus RHE, which is 6
times higher than the photocurrent
of the RF film at the same potential (0.06 mA cm–2). The photocurrent of the DC film achieved herein is comparable
to other bare, unmodified hematite thin films of 40–50 nm thickness
prepared by various methods, such as sputtering or ALD.16,18,27 However, it is lower than the
hematite layer deposited by Jia et al. by RF sputtering from a ceramic
hematite target (1.3 mA cm–2 at 1.5 V versus RHE).15 The higher performance of the hematite films
deposited by Jia et al. is most probably related to less physical
defects in the bulk of the film. It should be noted, nevertheless,
that the deposition rate in the paper by Jia et al. was only 0.14
Å s–1, whereas the DC sputtered thin films
in our study were deposited with a rate of 2.27 Å s–1; this is 15 times faster.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
To study
the dynamics of the charge transfer and recombination processes occurring
in the DC and RF films, EIS measurements were performed between 0.8
and 1.6 V versus RHE. Representative impedance spectra in the form
of Nyquist plots are shown in Figure 6a for DC and RF films at 1.2 V versus RHE, respectively.
Two main features are observed: A high-frequency arc with a relaxation
frequency between 1000 and 5000 Hz (denoted by the green ★),
which is characteristic for bulk processes in the semiconductor,18 and
a low-frequency arc at relaxation frequencies between 1 and 10 Hz
(denoted by the magenta ◆), which is attributed to charge transfer
processes related to the OER at the semiconductor–liquid interface.28

Figure 6 (a) Nyquist plot at 1.2 V versus RHE for the DC (red ▼)
and RF (■) thin films, respectively. EIS was performed in the
frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz under an illumination intensity
of 100 mW cm–2. The star symbols (green ★)
and diamond symbols (pink ◆) represent the relaxation frequencies
for the bulk and interface processes, respectively. (b) Equivalent
circuit model (ECM) used for fitting of the EIS data. (c) Surface
recombination resistance (Rtrap) for DC
and RF films obtained from ECM fitting between 0.8 and 1.6 V versus
RHE; (d, e) Charge transfer resistances Rss (■) and surface state capacitances Css (red ▼) from ECM fitting between 0.8 and 1.6 V versus
RHE for DC and RF films, respectively.

To gain a quantitative understanding of the features observed
in
the EIS spectra, the data were fitted with the equivalent circuit
model (ECM) proposed by Klahr et al.18 for
hematite thin films. This model assumes that the OER occurs via surface
states present at the hematite–electrolyte interface. Various
studies have shown the existence of such surface states, as summarized
by Zandi et al.,6 and have also been recently
observed directly by in operando ATR-FTIR studies.29 The data were also fitted to other ECM models suggested
in the literature, such as the Le Formal et al.30 model, which states that the OER takes place via direct
transfer from the valence band and the surface states only act as
recombination centers. Fitting with the 2-R-CPE models as proposed
by Lopes et al.28 was also performed, which
takes into account the Helmholtz layer capacitance (assuming it as
a value similar to the space-charge layer capacitance). However, the
best fit (lowest χ2 value) and most realistic ECM
component values were obtained for the Klahr model.

The ECM
(Figure 6b) consists
of the contact resistance, Rs; the capacitance
of the space-charge layer in the hematite, Cbulk; the resistance associated with the charge
recombination at the surface states, Rtrap; the chemical capacitance associated with the density of charge
carriers trapped at the surface states, Css; and the resistance associated with the charge transfer from the
surface states to the electrolyte during the OER, Rss. All of the fitting results are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Constant
phase elements (CPE) are used in the ECM due to nonideal dielectric
behavior of the hematite thin films. The quality of fit (denoted by
χ2) of the impedance spectra using an ECM with CPEs
was 2 orders of magnitude better than with pure capacitors. The relation
between capacitance and CPE fitting parameters is31 1  where T is the capacitance
fitting parameter (F sp–1 cm–2), p is the constant phase exponent (0 < p < 1), Reff =  for CPEbulk (assuming surface
distribution of time constants),32 and Reff = Rss for CPEss (assuming normal distribution of time constants).31

Figure 6c shows
the Rtrap values for the DC and RF films
between 0.8 and 1.6 V vs RHE. The Rtrap values are approximately 4–5 times higher for the RF film
compared to the DC film below 1.5 V versus RHE. This points to faster
charge recombination at the surface states for the RF film and is
one of the reasons for its lower PEC activity.

To study the
charge transfer kinetics from the surface states to
the electrolyte, the charge transfer resistance (Rss) and surface state capacitance (Css) values for the two films are analyzed (Figures 6d,e). For the DC film (Figure 6d), the charge transfer
resistance (Rss) shows a decrease of more
than 1 order of magnitude as the potential increases above Vonset of 0.88 V versus RHE (denoted by the dotted
line) and then increases at more anodic potentials. This decrease
in the charge transfer resistance is followed by a concomitant increase
in the surface state capacitance (Css),
which has a very low value below the onset potential, Vonset. It increases swiftly as Vonset is reached, with a maximum at 1 V (Vonset + 220 mV) and then declines rapidly at more anodic
potentials.

These observations are explained by the fact that
below Vonset, the holes trapped at the
surface states
do not have enough energy to initiate OER. Thus, as the potential
increases, the holes accumulate at the surface states, leading to
a peak in the Css value close to Vonset. Above Vonset, Rss drops, since there is enough overpotential
for OER to take place via the surface states, and since the holes
are now consumed, the Css value decreases.
This behavior of the Css and Rss values for the DC film is a clear indication that the
water oxidation takes place via surface states, as predicted theoretically
by Bertoluzzi et al.33 and also observed
experimentally in the literature.18,27,34

For the RF film (Figure 6e), a different trend with potential for
both Rss and Css values is observed.
This is due to the highly anodic Vonset for RF film with a value of 1.22 V versus RHE. Css increases above 1.1 V and reaches a maximum at 1.3
V (80 mV above Vonset). However, the broad
peak of the Css exhibits high values up
to 1.5 V, unlike the sharp Css peak observed
at 1 V for the DC film. Rss first increases
up to just above Vonset and then starts
to decrease, but the slope is less pronounced compared to the DC films.
In addition, the higher Rss values for
RF films below 1.3 V versus RHE suggest slower OER kinetics. These
different trends for the Rss and Css for the DC and RF films and the much higher Vonset for the latter are attributed to different
types of surface states for the two films. The difference in the surface
states is related to higher peak intensity corresponding to the presence
of either hydroxyl species (OH–) or oxygen vacancies
(Vo..), as observed in the O1s spectra for the
RF film (Figure 4),
which can lead to lower OER activity in hematite thin films.35,36

Intensity-Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy (IMPS)
IMPS37,38 was used to further determine the rate constants
of the surface state recombination and charge transfer processes.
In this technique, the frequency response of the photocurrent is measured
with respect to the sinusoidal modulation of the light source. The
IMPS response is plotted in a Nyquist plot with the complex photocurrent
as a function of the light modulation frequency (see Figure S6). The high-frequency intercept (HFI) with the real
photocurrent axis corresponds to the hole current (jhole), since the recombination rate is much lower than
the rate at which the hole concentration changes. The low-frequency
intercept (LFI) represents the steady-state photocurrent (jphoto), which is the fraction of the hole at
the surface that undergoes charge transfer to the electrolyte. The
ratio of LFI to HFI gives the charge transfer efficiency (ηt)39 2  where kt is the
charge transfer rate constant and kr is
the surface recombination rate constant. Furthermore, the radial frequency
at the apex of the semicircle (ωmax) in the upper
quadrant of the plot is given by the combined rate of charge transfer
and surface recombination (kt + kr).37,40

Figure 7 shows the rate constants for
charge transfer (kt) and surface recombination
(kr) and the charge transfer efficiency
(ηt) obtained for DC and RF films between 1.2 and
1.6 V versus RHE. The values and trends for the obtained parameters
lie within the range expected for plain hematite films and are in
good agreement with previously reported IMPS analyses by Peter et
al.39 and Thorne et al.41

Figure 7 (a) Charge transfer rate constants (kt: solid symbols) and surface recombination rate constant (kr: open symbols) for DC and RF films between
1.2 and 1.6 V versus RHE. (b) Charge transfer efficiency (ηt) for DC (red symbol) and RF (black symbol) thin films between
1.2 and 1.6 V versus RHE. All measurements were done in 1 M NaOH under
illumination from a 405 nm LED (ThorLabs) with an illumination intensity
of 22 mW cm–2.

Figure 7a
shows
that the charge transfer rate constant kt (solid symbols) is higher for the DC film at all potentials below
1.6 V vs RHE, pointing to faster OER kinetics compared to the RF film.
Furthermore, the kt value for the DC film
saturates around 30 s–1, whereas it increases almost
linearly for the RF film. This can be understood from the fact that
as the bias is increased, the RF film with poor OER activity shows
a much larger improvement in charge transfer kinetics. This also explains
why photocurrent saturation is observed for the DC film, but not for
the RF film at potentials above 1.2 V versus RHE in the J–V curve (Figure 5).

Furthermore, the surface state recombination
rate constant (kr) (open symbols in Figure 7a) is up to an order
of magnitude higher
for the RF film in the entire potential window compared to the DC
film. This confirms that there is higher surface state recombination
in the RF film, which is also observed from the higher Rtrap values as found by EIS for the RF film (Figure 6c). Moreover, value
of kr decreases for both DC and RF films
with increasing potential, which is explained by the more efficient
charge carrier separation as the result of increase in band bending
with applied potential. The difference in magnitude- and potential-dependent
behaviors of kt and kr for the DC and RF films occurs as a result of difference
in the surface states for the DC and RF films, as observed from XPS,
with the latter showing a higher concentration of surface species
(either hydroxyl group or oxygen vacancies), which have been shown
to reduce the charge transfer kinetics in hematite.

The effect
of the large differences in the kt and kr values for the DC and
RF films is clearly reflected in the charge transfer efficiency curve
(Figure 7b). The DC
film has a charge transfer efficiency greater than 60% at 1.2 V and
almost reaches 100% efficiency at 1.6 V versus RHE. The RF film, in
contrast, has a minimal efficiency at 1.2 V, concomitant with the
very high Vonset of 1.22 V versus RHE,
while the efficiency at 1.6 V is still below 80%. This explains the
much higher photocurrent and lower Vonset for the DC films and reinforces the observations from the EIS showing
the faster OER kinetics and lower surface state recombination for
the DC film compared to the RF film, which points to differences in
the surface states for the two films.

Hole Scavenger Measurements
Apart from surface state
recombination and slow charge transfer kinetics, another important
factor affecting the PEC activity of hematite thin films is the bulk
recombination. This was studied by performing hole scavenger measurements
in a 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M H2O2 electrolyte. Hole
scavengers remove the effect of surface recombination and slow OER
kinetics and ensure that the photocurrent is solely limited by bulk
recombination within the hematite layer.42 The photocurrents obtained for DC and RF films annealed at 645 °C
are shown in Figure 8 (the corresponding hole scavenger measurements for films annealed
at 800 °C are shown in Figure S8).
It is observed that the photocurrent for the DC film is much higher
than that for the RF film in the entire potential range. This confirms
that DC films have lower bulk recombination than RF films, which is
attributed to the presence of voids in the RF film and contributes
to its poor PEC activity.

Figure 8 Chopped-light measurements performed for the
DC (red) and RF (black)
thin films (annealed at 645 °C) in 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M H2O2 electrolyte. The light was chopped with a frequency
of 0.5 Hz. The illumination intensity was 100 mW cm–2.

Summary and Conclusions
We used two sputtering routes, namely, DC and reactive RF sputtering,
to fabricate Fe and FeOx thin films, respectively. All
thin films were annealed in air after deposition to obtain 40–50
nm thick hematite films. The DC sputtered film had a 6 times higher
photocurrent at 1.5 V versus RHE as well as a lower onset potential
(0.88 V versus RHE) than the RF sputtered film (1.22 V versus RHE).

The schematic shown in Figure 9 summarizes the main factors contributing to the better
PEC activity of DC sputtered thin films and their relation to the
physicochemical properties of the DC and RF sputtered hematite films.
The first factor is the faster charge transfer kinetics (denoted by
(i) in the schematic) in the DC film compared to the RF film. This
is illustrated by the green arrows: the thicker the arrow, the faster
the charge transfer kinetics. Another factor is the lower recombination
rate of the electrons with the holes trapped at the surface states
(denoted by (ii)) in the DC film compared to the RF film. This process
is represented by red arrows; the slower the recombination, the thinner
the arrow. The differences in charge transfer kinetics and surface
state recombination rate are due to the differences in the type of
surface states for the DC and reactive RF sputtered films. This is
related to the higher peak intensity corresponding to either hydroxyl
species (OH–) or defective oxide (Vo..) at the surface of the RF film.

Figure 9 Schematic illustrating
the differences in the (i) charge transfer
kinetics, (ii) surface state recombination rate, and (iii) bulk recombination
rate of DC and RF hematite thin films and the relation to their physicochemical
properties. The black arrow represents hole transport from the valence
band to surface states. The thick lines represent the major process,
while the thin lines represent minor processes occurring in the thin
films.

The difference in concentration
of the hydroxyl species or defective
oxide on the surface of the DC and RF films could be related to the
difference in the crystallographic orientation at the surface due
to changes in the preferential growth of the grains for the two films.
Finally, the densely packed, homogeneous grain structure of the DC
films leads to lower bulk recombination (denoted by (iii)) compared
to the RF film, as represented by the yellow arrows; the thinner arrows
represent lower bulk recombination. This is related to the presence
of voids within the grains of the RF film, which occur as a result
of the distinctive iron oxide growth process during the reactive RF
sputtering process and the subsequent annealing step.

In conclusion,
DC magnetron sputtering was used to deposit metallic
Fe films on FTO-glass substrates, which after annealing led to well-adhered
and stable hematite films exhibiting good PEC activity. These films
were compared to hematite films obtained by reactive RF sputtering
with an order of magnitude lower deposition rate. On subsequent annealing
of the RF films, they demonstrated significantly lower PEC activity.
A detailed study of the physicochemical and photoelectrochemical properties
was performed, and the relation between the film properties and PEC
behavior was established. Thus, DC sputtering as a fast, low-cost,
and scalable method for depositing photoelectrodes was demonstrated
and provides superior films compared to reactive RF sputtering.

Experimental
Section
Thin-Film Preparation
Iron and iron oxide thin films
were deposited by DC and reactive RF magnetron sputtering, respectively,
on glass substrates (2 mm thick) coated with an F:SnO2 (FTO)
conducting layer of approximately 200 nm thickness and 15 Ω
sq–1 sheet resistivity (MTI TEC15). The dimensions
of the FTO-coated glass substrates are 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm. The FTO
substrates were cleaned following the method proposed by Malviya et
al.43 A sputter tool from Kurt J. Lesker
was used with a base pressure <10–7 mbar and
a target–substrate distance of 95 mm. Both DC and RF magnetron
sputtering experiments were carried out at room temperature using
a 2″ Fe sputter target. For DC sputtering, an Ar flow of 7
sccm at a deposition pressure of 1.25 × 10–2 mbar and power of 100 W was used. The films were sputtered for 88
s with a sputter rate of 2.27 Å s–1 to obtain
a Fe film with thickness of 20 nm. Reactive RF magnetron sputtering
was performed with mixed Ar and O2 flows of 7 and 2 sccm,
respectively, with a deposition pressure of 1.4 × 10–2 mbar and a power of 200 W. Sputtering was performed for 1515 s at
a sputter rate of 0.33 Å s–1 to obtain a 50
nm Fe2O3 layer. All films were annealed in air
at a temperature of 645 °C for 10 min or 800 °C for 5 min
to obtain crystalline hematite thin films. A ramp rate of 5 °C
min–1 was applied to reach the desired annealing
temperature.

Physicochemical Characterization
The top-view morphologies
of the thin films were examined by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) (Zeiss Sigma) with an in-lens detector and 5 kV accelerating
voltage. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron
microscopy (HAADF-STEM) of the thin-film cross sections was performed
using a JEOL ARM200F TEM setup operated at 200 kV. TEM cross sections
of the thin films were prepared using focused ion beam milling. Pt
and carbon protective layers were deposited using ion-beam-induced
deposition (IBID) and electron-beam-induced deposition (EBID) to preserve
the thin-film structure during the milling process.

Structural
characterization was performed using a Bruker D8 Eco X-ray diffractometer
(XRD) with a Cu Kα (λ= 1.5406 Å) source and a Lynx-eye
detector in a grazing incidence configuration (GI-XRD) at an incident
angle of 0.5° and in the 2θ range of 20–80°.
A Thermo Scientific Kα X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
setup equipped with a monochromated Al Kα source (hν = 1486.6 eV) was used for the chemical analysis. The binding
energy was corrected with respect to the adventitious carbon C 1s
peak at 284.8 eV. Peak fitting was done using the Casa XPS software.
The optical absorbance of the films was characterized with a PerkinElmer
1050 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300–900
nm.

Electrochemical Characterization
An in-house three-electrode
electrochemical cell fitted with a quartz window was used for electrochemical
characterization. An aqueous solution of 1 M NaOH was used as the
electrolyte. For hole scavenger measurements, a 1 M NaOH + 0.1 M H2O2 electrolyte was used. A coiled Pt wire and a
Ag/AgCl/Sat. KCl electrode (XR 300, Radiometer Analytical) were used
as the counter electrode (CE) and reference electrode (RE), respectively.
The geometric area of the working electrode exposed to the electrolyte
was 0.785 cm2. The potential of the electrode was controlled
with a BioLogic SP-150 potentiostat. All potentials reported are versus
RHE through the relation2 3  with Φ°Ag/AgCl vs RHE = 0.198 V versus RHE at 25 °C. Illumination was provided by
an AM 1.5 class A solar simulator (LCS 100, Oriel Instruments) using
a 100 W Xe lamp with a calibrated illumination intensity of 100 mW
cm–2 at the sample position (Reference cell 91150
V, Newport). All measurements were done at potentials between 0.6
and 1.6 V versus RHE. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed
at a scan rate of 20 mV s–1. The onset potential
was taken as the potential at which the first derivative of the photocurrent
density with respect to the potential (dj/dV) achieved 10 times the value observed for the first derivative
of the dark current measurement. This technique was adopted from Le
Formal et al.11 Transient photocurrent
measurements were obtained by chopping the incident light with an
externally controlled shutter at a rate of 0.5 s–1 while performing linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at a scan rate of
10 mV s–1.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was performed in a frequency range of 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz. The magnitude
of the modulation signal applied to the potential was 10 mV. The potential
at which the EIS scans were performed was increased stepwise by 0.1
V between 0.6 and 1.6 V versus RHE. Equivalent circuit fitting of
the EIS images was performed using the ZView software. A Solartron
ModuLab XM potentiostat with photoelectrochemical accessory was used
for intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements.
A 455 nm LED (ThorLabs) with an illumination intensity of 22 mW cm–2 was used as a light source. A 10% AC modulation intensity
was used for the measurements in the frequency range of 50 kHz to
0.1 Hz. The electrochemical cell, RE, and CE were the same as those
used for the other PEC measurements.
