In the current study,
a mediator-free solid-state BiVO4/pyridine-doped g-C3N4 nano-Z-scheme photocatalytic
system (BDCN) with superior visible-light absorption and optimized
photocatalytic activity was constructed via an in situ hydrothermal
method for the first time. The pyridine-doped g-C3N4 (DCN) nanosheets show strong absorbance in the visible-light
region by pyridine doping, and the BiVO4 (∼10 nm)
nanoparticles are successfully in situ grown on the surface of DCN
nanosheets by the controlled hydrothermal method. Under the irradiation
of visible light (λ > 420 nm), the BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite
photocatalysts efficiently degrade phenol and methyl orange (MO) and
display much higher photocatalytic activity than the individual DCN,
bulk BiVO4, or the simple physical mixture of DCN and BiVO4. The greatly improved photocatalytic ability is attributed
to the construction of the direct Z-scheme system in the BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite free from any mediator, which leads to
enhanced separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs,
as confirmed by the photocurrent analysis. The
possible Z-scheme mechanism of the BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite
photocatalyst was investigated by transient time-resolved luminescence
decay spectrum, active species trapping experiments, electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) technology, and hydrogen evolution test.

1 Introduction
Semiconductor-based
photocatalysis has attracted increasing attentions
as it has the potential to eliminate the environmental contamination
because of its low cost and eco-friendly nature.1,2 Photocatalysts
with efficient solar energy utilization capability and quantum efficiency
are necessary for applying the photocatalysis technology into practical
applications. Unfortunately, the limitation on practical applications
of the most applied semiconductor photocatalysts is that they can
only absorb ultraviolet (UV) light.3 As
a result, exploiting visible-light-driven photocatalysts with high
efficiency and good durability has been a hot spot in the field of
photocatalysis.

Recently, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has been regarded as a promising visible-light-driven
photocatalyst
because of its appropriate band gap and unique optical properties
with promising performance in the degradation of organic pollutants.4,5 The relatively very negative conduction band (CB) (−1.13
eV) enables a strong reduction potential of the photogenerated electron.
However, the photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is restricted by its insufficient visible-light absorbance, slow
charge-carrier transport, and high recombination of photogenerated
charge carriers. To overcome these inherent drawbacks of g-C3N4, various methods, including structure regulations,6,7 molecular doping,8−19 and heterojunction,20−28 have been developed to improve the photocatalytic activity and selectivity
of g-C3N4. Inspired by the thermal polymerization
process of the precursors during the fabrication of C3N4, Wang et al.8 exploited a molecular
doping strategy in which small organic molecules were incorporated
into the g-C3N4 network by a copolymerization
process, which can not only enhance the light absorbance of g-C3N4 but also create surface dyadic heterostructures
to promote the separation of the generated charge carriers on the
surface of the molecular-doped g-C3N4, thus
resulting in a higher photocatalytic activity. Latterly, various types
of monomer precursors with cyano and/or amino groups have been developed
for integrating organic molecules with different functional groups
into the CN frameworks.9−19 However, after modification by the organic molecular doping method,
the valence band (VB) position of g-C3N4 was
sharply shifted toward the negative potential position, which was
detrimental to its applications in the organic pollutant degradation
by dramatically decreasing the oxidizability of the organic-molecule-doped
g-C3N4.19,29 Therefore, it is highly
desired to develop a novel strategy to maintain or enhance the reducibility
and oxidizability of the organic-molecule-doped g-C3N4.

More recently, the construction of the g-C3N4-based Z-scheme system has been developed as another
feasible and
efficient method to promote the photocatalytic performance of g-C3N4 because of the fact that the Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer
channel can facilitate the separation and restrain the recombination
of photoinduced charge carriers.30−39 In the Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer channel, the photogenerated
electrons in the CB of oxidation semiconductor will recombine with
the photogenerated holes in the VB of reduction semiconductor through
the Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer channel rather than the vastly
reported heterojunction channel in the composites. Thus, the reducibility
of photogenerated electron in the CB of reduction semiconductor and
the oxidizability of photogenerated holes in the CB and VB of oxidation
semiconductor in the Z-scheme system were retain and enhanced. Therefore,
it enlightened us to enhance the reducibility and oxidizability of
the organic-molecule-doped g-C3N4 by the construction
of a mediator-free solid-state g-C3N4-based
Z-scheme system. The band gap of BiVO4 is 2.40 eV, which
is visible-light-responsive semiconductor and thus shows a great potential
in visible-light-driven Z-scheme photocatalysts.40 The relatively low VB position makes it a good candidate
in the construction of the Z-scheme photocatalytic system with g-C3N4. It is highly anticipated that combining the
enhanced light absorbance ability by the organic molecular doping
strategy and the preserved or enhanced reducibility and oxidizability
by the Z-scheme system strategy, our proposed BiVO4/organic-molecule-doped
g-C3N4 Z-scheme photocatalytic system will be
quite promising as an excellent photocatalytic system. To the best
of our knowledge, the combination of the organic-molecule-doped g-C3N4 by copolymerization and mediator-free solid-state
Z-scheme designation to synergistically achieve the enhanced photocatalytic
property has not been reported yet. Moreover, very few works have
focused on the geometry architectures of g-C3N4-based Z-scheme systems, such as size, spatial distribution, and
morphologies, which have critical influences on the light-harvesting
activity, charge-carrier separation, and photocatalytic activity of
the g-C3N4-based Z-scheme system.

In our
current work, a novel and mediator-free solid-state BiVO4/pyridine-doped g-C3N4 (BDCN) nano-Z-scheme
photocatalytic system with superior visible-light absorbance ability
and photocatalytic activity was demonstrated for the first time, which
was obtained by the successful in situ growth of BiVO4 nanoparticles
(∼10 nm) on the surface of pyridine-doped g-C3N4 (denoted as DCN) nanosheets via a controlled hydrothermal
method. The obtained BDCN nano-Z-scheme photocatalytic system was
characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
diffuse reflectance spectrum (DRS). Degradation of phenol and methyl
orange (MO) was performed to evaluate the photocatalytic activity
of the samples under visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).
Furthermore, the possible photocatalytic Z-scheme mechanism was investigated
and confirmed via active species trapping experiments, electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) measurement, and hydrogen evolution test, and the
stability and recyclability of the BDCN photocatalytic system were
also examined.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural and Optical Analysis
To
verify the successful doping of the pyridine ring into the carbon
nitride network in the DCN and BDCN samples, the solid-state 13C NMR spectrum measurement was recorded, and the obtained
results are shown in Figure 1A. Compared with the pure g-C3N4 (CN)
and the BiVO4/undoped g-C3N4 nanocomposite
(denoted as BCN, prepared by the same hydrothermal method, and the
mass percentage of g-C3N4 was optimized in terms
of the results of photocatalytic analysis), the DCN and BDCN4 (40%
mass percentage of DCN in BDCN) samples show an additional broad peak
centered at 115.8 ppm in the 13C NMR spectra, suggesting
that the pyridine ring was doped successfully into the carbon nitride
network in the DCN and BDCN4 samples. Moreover, the BDCN4 sample shows
the identical solid state 13C NMR spectrum before and after
photocatalytic reaction (Figure 1B), suggesting that the pyridine ring in the carbon
nitride network is stable under light irradiation.

Figure 1 (A) Solid-state 13C NMR spectra of CN, BCN, DCN, and
BDCN4 and (B) solid-state 13C NMR spectra of BDCN4 before
and after light irradiation.

The XRD patterns was taken to detect the crystalline and
chemical
structures of the samples, and the outputs are shown in Figure 2. Two pronounced peaks in the
DCN sample at 13.04° and 27.47° are observed, corresponding
to the (100) and (002) diffractions of DCN, respectively. The (100)
and (002) diffractions are attributed to the in-plane structural packing
mode and the interlayer stacking of aromatic networks, respectively.4,5 The diffraction pattern of the bulk BiVO4 sample shows
a series of peaks that can be indexed to the monoclinic shelties phase of BiVO4 (JCPDS card #14-0688). In the case of the BDCN nanocomposites,
the XRD pattern of BDCN shows both the characteristic diffractions
of DCN and the monoclinic shelties of BiVO4, implying that
the hydrothermal process leads to the successful in situ formation
of a BiVO4 structure and has no dramatic influence on the
structure of DCN. In addition, the intensities of DCN diffraction
peaks gradually increase from BDCN1 to BDCN5, corresponding to the
variation of DCN contents from 10 to 50%.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of DCN,
bulk BiVO4, and BDCN composites.

The FT-IR spectra of DCN, BiVO4, and BDCN1–5
samples are shown in Figure S1. The pure
BiVO4 sample shows the peaks at 839 and 745 cm–1, which correspond to ν1 symmetric stretching and ν3
asymmetric stretching vibrations of VO4, respectively.
The DCN sample shows typical peaks at 900–1500 and 809 cm–1, representing the typical stretching vibration of
CN heterocyclic and plane breathing and vibration of triazine units,
respectively. Moreover, the broad peak at 2800–3450 cm–1 is ascribed to the adsorbed O–H vibration
in water molecules and the N–H vibration because of the surface
uncondensed amine groups. For the BDCN composites, all BDCN samples
show the characteristic peaks of both DCN and BiVO4, further
confirming the composite structure between DCN and BiVO4. It also indicates that the hydrothermal treatment did not change
the C–N heterocycles and the chemical bond dramatically in
the carbon nitride structure.

The actual mass percent of DCN
in the composite photocatalyst was
determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DCN was decomposed
at 1000 K, whereas BiVO4 remained stable above 1000 K (Figure S2). Thus, the mass percent of DCN in
the composite photocatalysts was estimated by the mass loss between
300 and 1000 K, which was determined as 10.8, 19.9, 30.4, 39.9, and
49.7% for the samples BDCN1–BDCN5, respectively. This is in
good agreement with the theoretical mass percentages.

The optical
properties of the DCN, BiVO4, and BDCN composites
were monitored by DRS, as shown in Figure 3. Pure bulk BiVO4 shows a steep
absorption edge at around 524 nm, which reveals a band gap energy
of 2.37 eV. DCN has a broader absorption edge at 576 nm, relating
to a band gap energy of 2.16 eV. After combined with BiVO4, the obtained BDCN composites present a gradual shift to the red
edge of the absorption band as the DCN contents increase, indicating
that DCN has a significant light-harvesting ability in the BDCN composite
photocatalysts. From Figure S3, it can be found that both DCN and BDCN samples show much
wider light absorption range than the pure CN and BCN samples, suggesting
that the pyridine doping can efficiently extend the light absorbance
of the doped carbon nitride and BDCN samples.

(UV–vis) DRS of the samples and

The morphology of DCN, BiVO4, and BDCN
was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 4. DCN shows the crumpled layered
structure containing several stacking layers, indicating the planar
graphite-like structure of carbon nitride. The blank BiVO4 exhibits a decagonal shape with a size of 150–300 nm. Compared
with the morphology of DCN and BiVO4, the small-sized BiVO4 particles with a size of about 10 nm are found to disperse
on the crumpled DCN surface, which will be further confirmed by the
TEM images. Additionally, the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS)
was also adopted to analyze the elements in the BDCN4 nanocomposite,
and the result is given in Figure 4D. It can be clearly found that C, N, Bi, V, and O
elements exist in the BDCN4 samples, which further confirms the compositional
structure of the BDCN samples.

Figure 4 SEM images of DCN (A), bulk BiVO4 (B), BDCN4 (C), and
their corresponding EDS patterns (D).

Moreover, the morphology of DCN, BiVO4, and contact
interface between DCN and BiVO4 in the BDCN sample was
analyzed by TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), as shown in Figure 5. The typical graphite-like
structure of DCN is clearly evidenced in Figure 5A, as evidenced by the result of SEM. In
the absence of DCN, the BiVO4 particles obtained by the
hydrothermal route show the agglomerations with diameters ranging
from 150 to 300 nm, and no nanosized BiVO4 particles are
obtained (Figure 5B).
However, it is very interesting to note from Figure 5C that the BiVO4 nanoparticles
with the average size of approximately 10 nm were successfully in
situ synthesized and deposited on the surface of DCN uniformly in
the presence of DCN during the hydrothermal process after precise
control over the hydrothermal synthesis. Compared with the bulk BiVO4, the size of in situ synthesized BiVO4 decreases
obviously with the introduction of DCN. Bi3+ ions can be
bound on the surface of DCN by chemisorption between the Bi3+ ion and the heptazine rings of DCN, which successfully prevents
the overgrowth and agglomeration of the BiVO4 particles.
This demonstrates that the in situ hydrothermal method is a feasible
route to construct the uniform BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite
photocatalyst. The HRTEM image in Figure 5D shows that the lattice spacings of 0.292
and 0.308 nm correspond to the (040) and (121) planes of monoclinic
shelties of BiVO4, respectively, and the lattice spacing
of 0.324 nm corresponds to the (020) plane of DCN. Figure 5D also reveals the intimate
interface between DCN nanosheets and BiVO4 nanoparticles,
indicating that the BiVO4 nanoparticles are tightly attached
to the surface of DCN, which is beneficial to the transport of photoinduced
charge carriers.

(C), and
HRTEM image of BDCN4 (D).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technology was applied
to
further study the surface chemical composition and the oxidation state
of the elements in the BDCN4, as shown in Figure S4. The C 1s, N 1s, Bi 4f, V 2p, and O 1s are all found in
the survey XPS spectrum (Figure S4A). The
peak of C 1s at 284.6 eV can be attributed to the adventitious carbon
on the surface of g-C3N4, and the two peaks
at 286 and 288.2 eV both belong to the sp2-hybridized C
[C–(N)3] (Figure S4B).
The main features of N 1s include a broad and wide peak from 398 to
403.5 eV (Figure S4C), in which the existence
of the sp2-bonded DCN in the BDCN4 nanocomposites was verified
by the sp2-hybridized nitrogen (C=N–C) of
N 1s peak at 398.8 eV. The peak at 400.1 eV corresponds to tertiary
nitrogen N–(C)3 groups, and the peak at 401.3 eV
relates to the effects of charging reaction.17−19 The binding
energies of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 are 164.3
and 159.2 eV, respectively (Figure S4D),
and the two peaks at 516.6 and 526.1 eV can be attributed to V 2p
(Figure S4E). In the O 1s region (Figure S4F), one peak at 529.4 eV belongs to
the Bi–O bonds of (Bi2O2)2+ units and one minor peak at 530.1 eV is attributed to the −OH
groups on the surface. The XPS results further demonstrate the composition
of DCN and BiVO4 in the prepared BDCN nanocomposites.

2.2 Photocatalysis Analysis
The photocatalytic
activities of the as-prepared DCN, BiVO4, BCN, and BDCN
samples were examined by the photodegradation of phenol (Figure 6A,B) and MO (Figure 6C,D) under visible-light
irradiation (λ > 420 nm). Because of the poor oxidation ability
of DCN associated with the relatively high level of VB position, the
photodegradation of phenol is not quite efficient. The DCN sample
presents only 21.2% removal efficiency within 150 min (Figure 6A) on phenol. The bulk BiVO4 shows better oxidation ability because of its low level of
VB position, achieving 49.5% removal efficiency in the degradation
of phenol in 150 min. Interestingly, the BDCN nanocomposites demonstrate
much higher activities than pristine DCN or bulk BiVO4,
up to 69.8, 77.3, 87.4, 97.1, and 92.0% removal efficiency by BDCN1,
BDCN2, BDCN3, BDCN4, and BDCN5 nanocomposite photocatalysts, respectively,
which increase with the doping concentration of DCN from 10 to 40%
but levels off at 50%. This decreased photocatalytic activity was
due to the decrease in the light absorbance of BiVO4 and/or
the enhanced recombination of photoinduced charge carriers when the
mass percent of DCN is over 50%. In the presence of the BDCN4 nanocomposite,
which shows the best photocatalytic activity over all BDCN nanocomposite
photocatalysts, nearly 92% of phenol and 97% of MO molecules (Figure 6C) are photodecomposed
within 150 min under visible-light irradiation. Moreover, the apparent
rate constant for phenol photodecomposition obtained from the BDCN4
sample is 0.02202 min–1, which is about 13.7 times
higher than that of the DCN sample (0.0016 min–1) and 5.0 times higher than that from the BiVO4 sample
(0.0044 min–1) (Figure 6B). The apparent rate constant for the MO
decomposition obtained from the BDCN4 sample is 0.0215 min–1, which is about 6.3 times higher than that from the DCN sample (0.0034
min–1) and 4.2 times higher than that from the BiVO4 sample (0.0051 min–1) (Figure 6D). Moreover, the BDCN4 sample
shows a more effective photocatalytic activity than the pyridine-free
undoped BiVO4/g-C3N4-4 (the BCN nanocomposite
with the mass percentage of g-C3N4 at 40%),
a simple physical mixture of DCN and BiVO4 (40% of DCN
by mass), BiVO4/CN samples made by a mixing-calcination
method, and BiVO4/CN made by ultrasound-assisted41 and calcination methods,42 implying there occurred more efficient charge-carrier separation
and transfer in the BDCN nanocomposite than those in the simple physical
mixture, mixing-calcination-prepared sample, and much more efficient
visible-light-harvesting capability than the BCN sample (Figure S5).

Figure 6 Photocatalytic
activities of the samples on the photodegradation
and corresponding rate constants for phenol (A,B) and MO (C,D) under
visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).

The total organic carbon (TOC) analysis was also applied
to evaluate
the mineralization ratio of organic contaminant photodecomposition
in water over the photocatalysts. As illustrated in Figure 7, the TOC in the phenol and
MO solution during photodegradation decreases with the irradiation
time and down to 38.6 and 26.3% after 150 min irradiation, respectively,
indicating that about 73.6 and 61.4% organic carbon in phenol and
MO are photodegraded into inorganic carbon (CO2). The TOC
results indicate that phenol and MO are extensively degraded by the
photocatalytic process over the BDCN nanocomposites, rather than just
being decolorized to some organic intermediates, which may be still
hazardous to the environment. However, the TOC in the phenol and MO
solution did not decrease to zero, suggesting that there must be some
intermediate products in the final solution. The main intermediate
products and their distribution in the photodegradation of phenol
and MO in the presence of BDCN4 were detected by liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS), and the mass spectrum intensity variation
of the intermediate products is displayed in Figure 8. The m/z of phenol, MO, and the corresponding intermediate products in the
degradation process are presented in Figure S6. Under visible-light irradiation, phenol (m/z = 94) is directly oxidized into catechol (m/z = 110) and hydroquinone (m/z = 110) first. The peak intensities of catechol and hydroquinone
reach a maximum with the irradiation time, which then gradually transfer
to maleic anhydride (m/z = 98) through
the ring cleavage process and can be ultimately mineralized into carbon
dioxide and water. For the MO degradation, after visible-light irradiation,
the peak intensity of MO (m/z =
304) was oxidized to some fragment ions including [M – H –
SO2]− (m/z = 241), [M – H – C6H4SO3]− (m/z = 147), and [M – H – C6H4(CH3) SO2]− (m/z = 150), which increase and reach the maximum rapidly and
then decrease by decomposing them to a smaller molecule fragment,
such as [M – H – C6H5SO2]− (m/z = 162)
and [M – H – N2C6H4(CH3)2]− (m/z = 156).43

sample under visible-light irradiation.

The interfacial charge-carrier-transfer dynamics between
the DCN,
BiVO4, and BDCN photocatalysts were assessed by photocurrent–time
measurement, and transient photocurrent responses and the results
are shown in Figure 9A. Obviously, all BDCN nanocomposites exhibit a higher photocurrent
than DCN and BiVO4, indicating that the formation of the
BDCN nanocomposite by combining DCN with BiVO4 can facilitate
the separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. However,
BDCN5 shows a decreased photocurrent that is attributed to the excess
DCN that decreases the light absorbance of BiVO4 and enhances
the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. In
addition, a comparison of the photocurrent among CN, DCN, BCN, and
BDCN4 samples was made, and the results are shown in Figure 9B. The DCN and BDCN4 samples
show much higher photocurrent than CN and BCN because of the incorporation
of pyridine into the CN network, which can delocalize the aromatic
system. This enhances the separation of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.

2.3 Mechanism of Photocatalytic
Degradation
A series of active oxygen species, such as hole
(h+),
hydroxyl radical (•OH), and superoxide radical (•O2–), are hypothesized
to be involved in the current photocatalytic degradation of phenol
or dye.44 To investigate the photocatalytic
mechanism, ammonium oxalate (AO), isopropanol (IPA), and benzoquinone
(BQ) were introduced into the photocatalytic oxidation process separately
over the BDCN4 photocatalyst and acted as the scavengers for h+, •OH, and •O2–, respectively. The photocatalytic analysis results
(Figure 10A) indicate
that the addition of IPA and AO slightly hinders the MO degradation
rate but the addition of BQ strongly suppresses the MO degradation
rate, indicating that •O2– is the major oxygen active species, whereas •OH
is the minor oxygen active species in photodegradation. The addition
of IPA and AO shows a similar inhibition effect, which suggests that •OH is generated by the reaction between h+ and H2O. In the meanwhile, the photocatalytic experiments
over the BDCN4 photocatalyst were also performed under different atmospheres
(O2 and N2 gases) to investigate the active
oxy-radical, and the results are given in Figure 10B. It is found that the degradation rate
is suppressed under an N2 atmosphere but slightly improved
by bubbling O2, revealing that O2 dissolved
in the suspension acts as the electron trapper, thus resulting in
the generation of •O2–. For comparison, the photocatalytic activity of the BiVO4 and DCN samples after the addition of AO, IPA, and BQ was also investigated,
as shown in Figure 10B,C, from which a conclusion can be drawn that •O2– plays the most crucial role in the
oxidation process over DCN, whereas for the pure bulk BiVO4, •OH was the main active species during the photodegradation
process. Therefore, in general, the active species of the BDCN nanocomposite
in the degradation process is determined to be •O2– and •OH species.

activity of BDCN4 (A), BiVO4 (B), and
DCN (C) photocatalysts in the process of the MO photodegradation with
different scavengers existing under visible-light irradiation (λ
> 420 nm) and VB XPS of DCN (D).

For the sake of explaining the enhanced photocatalytic activity
and exploring the possible mechanism, the band edge positions of the
VB and CB of BiVO4 and DCN were determined by VB XPS and
the empirical equation (EVB = ECB + Eg), which
is shown in Figure 10D. The band gap energy of DCN was assumed to be 2.16 eV, as discussed
above in the results of DRS. According to the VB XPS and empirical eq 2, the VB and CB positions
of DCN were calculated as 1.81 and −0.35 eV versus the normal
hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively. For BiVO4, the
positions of the VB and CB were calculated by the following empirical eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  where EVB corresponds
to the VB edge potential; ECB corresponds
to the CB edge potential; χ corresponds to the electronegativity
of the semiconductor, which is the geometric average of the absolute
electronegativity of the constituent atoms (the χ value of BiVO4 is 6.15 eV); Ee corresponds to
the free-electron energy on the hydrogen scale (Ee ≈ 4.5 eV); and Eg corresponds to the band gap energy of the semiconductor. The band
gap energy of BiVO4 was calculated as 2.36 eV from the
result of DRS. Thus, the CB position of the BiVO4 was calculated
to be 0.47 eV versus NHE, and the corresponding VBs was calculated
to be 2.83 eV versus NHE.

To further investigate
the photocatalytic mechanism of BDCN, an
EPR spin-trap technique with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) was applied to further confirm the production of the
active species •O2– and •OH. Typically, DMPO acts as a radical scavenger
by the formation of the stable DMPO–•O2– or the DMPO–•OH adduct species. No obvious EPR signals of DMPO–•O2– and DMPO–•OH adducts in all MO solution were observed in the dark. Under the
light irradiation, the four characteristic peaks of DMPO–•O2– adducts (Figure 11A) are found in
the solutions of BDCN and DCN, and the six characteristic peaks of
the DMPO–•OH adducts (Figure 11B) are found in the solutions of BDCN and
BiVO4, suggesting that •O2– was produced as the active species only in DCN
and •OH was produced as the active species only
in BiVO4, whereas both the •OH and •O2– radicals were produced
as the active species in BDCN photoreaction systems.

over the BDCN4, DCN, and BiVO4 in the MO solution before
and after the photodegradation process.

If the transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs
of
BDCN follows a heterojunction pathway (shown in scheme 1A), because the CB and VB edge potentials
of DCN are more negative than the CB and VB edge potentials of BiVO4, the photogenerated electrons in the CB of DCN will migrate
to the CB of BiVO4, and the holes in the VB of BiVO4 will transfer to the VB of DCN. However, the electrons in
the CB of BiVO4 cannot react with the dissolved oxygen
molecule to produce •O2– as the active species because the CB position of BiVO4 is 0.47 V versus NHE, which is more positive than that of O2/•O2– (−0.33
V vs NHE). Similarly, the holes in the VB of DCN cannot react with
H2O to produce •OH because the position
of VB of DCN is 1.81 V versus NHE, which is more negative than that
of H2O/•OH (2.72 V vs NHE). Thus, •OH and •O2– cannot be detected as the active species in the photocatalytic reaction
systems if the transfer pathway of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs of BDCN follows a heterojunction pathway.

Scheme 1 Proposed Photocatalytic
Charge-Carrier-Transfer Mechanisms in the
BDCN Nanocomposite System under Visible-Light Irradiation: (A) Heterojunction
and (B) Z-Scheme
To further confirm this hypothesis, the transient time-resolved
luminescence decay and photoluminescence (PL) measurement experiment
was conducted, and the results are shown in Figure 12. These decay curves are well-fitted to
a double-exponential PL decay model, as shown in Figure 12A–C. The fast PL lifetime
component (τ1) and the slow PL lifetime component
(τ2) are ascribed to the surface-related nonradiative
recombination processes and the recombination of free exciton,45 respectively. Compared with BiVO4 (4.78 ns) and DCN (4.95 ns), the BDCN4 sample displays a longer
PL decay lifetime of 10.22 ns. Both the τ1 and τ2 and PL life times (τ) of BDCN are longer than those
of BiVO4 and DCN, suggesting that the separation of the
photogenerated charge carrier of BDCN is higher than those of BiVO4 and DCN.46,47 Moreover, the PL spectra show
that the PL intensities of BDCN are higher than those of DCN and BiVO4 (Figure 12D), suggesting a higher recombination probability of the photogenerated
charge carrier of the composites than that of DCN and BiVO4. If the charge-carrier transfer of BDCN4 is heterojunction, a faster
PL decay kinetics and a lower PL intensity should be observed. However,
BDCN4 shows a much slower PL decay process and weaker PL intensity,
and as shown in the result of photocurrent–time measurement
above, the charge-carrier transfer of BDCN is more efficient than
those of other photocatalysts, which are contradictory to traditional
heterojunction, suggesting that the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs between BiVO4 and DCN follow another transfer channel
than heterojunction. Furthermore, the photocatalytic hydrogen generation
experiment was carried out, and the result is shown in Figure S7. The average hydrogen generation rate
of BDCN is 26.3 μmol/h, which is about two times higher than
that of DCN (14.4 μmol/h), whereas BiVO4 cannot generate
hydrogen, revealing that the CB position of BDCN is more negative,
which is further against the heterojunction mechanism.

and (D) photoluminescence of BiVO4, DCN, and BDCN4 excited
by 450 nm in air at the normal atmospheric temperature.

Consulting the similar works reported by other
groups,36−40,45−48 the Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer
channel existing in natural photosynthesis appears to be more proper
for our BDCN photocatalysts, as shown in Scheme 1B. Under visible-light irradiation, both
DCN and BiVO4 can be excited and electron–hole pairs
are generated. The photoexcited electrons in the CB of BiVO4 are transferred to the VB of DCN quickly through the interface between
DCN and BiVO4 and then combine with the holes in the VB
of DCN, which leads to a slower PL decay process and a weak PL intensity
of BDCN than those of DCN and BiVO4. Consequently, the
most negative electrons in the CB of DCN reduce the molecular oxygen
dissolved in water to yield •O2–, and the most positive holes in the VB of BiVO4 generate
the active •OH radicals. The verification of •O2– ion and •OH radicals as the active species confirms the likely direct Z-scheme
mechanism of our photocatalytic system. Namely, the Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer
channel is favorable to preserve the strong reducing capacity of electrons
in the CB of DCN and the oxidizing capacity of holes in the VB of
BiVO4 for the production of •O2– and •OH reactive species, thus
leading to significantly efficient separation of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs and enhanced photocatalytic performance.

In general, the
much higher photocatalytic activity of BDCN than
that of DCN, bulk BiVO4, BCN, or physical mixture can be
ascribed to (1) the enhanced absorption ability by pyridine doping
method, (2) the in situ growth of small nanosized BiVO4 particles, and (3) the mediator-free Z-scheme charge-carrier-transfer
route between the doped DCN and BiVO4 nanoparticles, which
can not only preserve the high oxidation potential of the photogenerated
electrons and holes in the CB of DCN and VB of BiVO4 but
also reduce the recombination rate of electron–hole pairs.

The stability and reusability of the BDCN4 photocatalyst were assessed
by the recycling photodegradation experiment, and the result is shown
in Figure 13. Even
after five times of successive recycling photodegradation experiments,
the BDCN4 photocatalyst did not show obvious decrease in the photocatalytic
degradation activity under visible-light irradiation, implying that
the BDCN4 photocatalyst is sufficiently stable for photocatalytic
degradation. Moreover, the crystalline structure of BDCN4 photocatalysts
after photocatalytic experiments was examined by XRD, as shown in Figure S8. No obvious change in the crystalline
structure was observed, further demonstrating the superior stability
of our BDCN nanocomposite photocatalyst.

3 Conclusions
A direct
solid-state nano-Z-scheme BiVO4/DCN photocatalytic
system with a superior visible-light-harvesting ability and a photocatalytic
activity was synthesized via an in situ hydrothermal method in this
work. The BiVO4 nanoparticles were successfully in situ
deposited on the DCN nanosheets uniformly. All as-synthesized BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite photocatalysts showed photocatalytic activity
superior to those of the pristine DCN, bulk BiVO4, and
physical DCN/BiVO4 mixture under visible-light irradiation
(λ > 420 nm). •O2– and •OH are confirmed to be the oxygen active
species by the active species trapping experiments and EPR technology.
Moreover, the hydrogen evolution test, decreased PL decay process,
and increase in the PL intensity further verified that the Z-scheme
charge-carrier-transfer channel is more suitable to explain the mechanism
than that of heterojunction for the BDCN photocatalyst. The significantly
improved photocatalytic activity under visible-light irradiation of
our successful design of solid-state nano-Z-scheme principled BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite can be ascribed to the enhanced visible-light
absorption and largely reduced the recombination of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs. Moreover, the excellent stability and
the recycling ability of our BiVO4/DCN nanocomposite photocatalyst
ensure its practical applications in the environmental remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of DCN, BiVO4, and
BDCN
The DCN sample was synthesized via organic pyridine
doping approach and thermal copolymerization treatment, as reported
in our previous research.14 Briefly, 70
mg of 2,6-diaminopyridine (DPY) and 3.0 g of dicyandiamide were dispersed
into 15 mL of water, and the mixed solution was maintained at 100
°C under stirring to remove water. Finally, the obtained solid
precursor was put in a crucible and maintained at 550 °C for
4 h in a muffle furnace with the heating rate of 15 °C/min under
the air atmosphere. The obtained solid pyridine-doped g-C3N4 was denoted as DCN. The BDCN nanocomposite photocatalysts
were in situ synthesized by a controlled hydrothermal route. The Bi3+ ions were absorbed on the surface of g-C3N4 by a chemical bond49,50 because of the tri-s-triazine (heptazine) ring structure of g-C3N4, which benefited the growth and dispersion of BiVO4 nanoparticles on the surface of the DCN sheet. The controlled
in situ hydrothermal synthesis procedure of BDCN is described as follows:
1.81 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.435
g of NH4VO3, 1.16 g of urea, and different amounts
of DCN were mixed in 30 mL of deionized (DI) water. HNO3 (6 M) was used to adjust the pH of the mixture to 1, and the mixture
was stirred for 1 h at 25 °C. The obtained mixture solution was
sealed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL) and kept
at 180 °C for 4 h. After being cooled down to 25 °C naturally,
the precipitate was filtered, collected, washed by DI water, and finally
maintained at 60 °C for drying. The obtained BDCN nanocomposite
photocatalysts with different mass percentages of DCN varying from
10 to 50% were denoted as BDCN1, BDCN2, BDCN3, BDCN4, and BDCN5, respectively.
In the absence of DCN, only the bulk BiVO4 sample was obtained
by the same hydrothermal process. For comparison, the pure g-C3N4 was prepared by thermal polymerization (denoted
as CN). In addition, the BiVO4/undoped g-C3N4 nanocomposite was also prepared by the same hydrothermal
method (denoted as BCN, the mass percentage of g-C3N4 was optimized in terms of the results of photocatalytic analysis).

4.2 Characterization
Powder XRD measurement
was carried out on a D/Max-IIIA instrument by using Cu Kα radiation
(the scanning rate was 0.02°·s–1). The
FT-IR spectrum was recorded on a Vector 33 infrared spectrometer.
Thermal degradation was identified via TGA (TGA 92-18, Setaram, N2 atmosphere, 313–1173 K). DRS were recorded by a Shimadzu
U-3010 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as the reflectance
standard. XPS of the samples was obtained by an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer
equipped with a pre-reduction chamber. SEM and TEM images were obtained
by S-3700 scanning TEM and JEM 2100 field emission TEM. The solid-state 13C NMR spectra were measured by a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer.
The transient time-resolved luminescence decay spectra were recorded
by FLS980 series of fluorescence spectrometers. EPR measurements with
and without light irradiation were recorded using a Bruker model A300
spectrometer. Two filters, an IR cutoff (λ < 800 nm) and
a UV cutoff (λ > 420 nm), installed between the 300 W Xe
lamp
and the samples, filtered out the light, which were used as the visible-light
source. The TOC of the phenol or MO solution was tested by a high-temperature
TOC/TNb analyzer (Liqui TOC II, Elementar, Germany).

4.3 Photocatalytic Activity
Degradation
of the phenol and MO solution under visible-light irradiation was
performed to evaluate the photocatalytic activities of the catalysts.
The phenol compound is considered to be a direct threat to the health
of humankind because of its highly toxic, persistent, and biorecalcitrant
properties. In a typical experiment, 0.05 g of the as-prepared photocatalyst
was dispersed into 150 mL of the phenol or MO aqueous solution with
a concentration of 10 mg/L under stirring. Before light irradiation,
the suspension was stirred for half an hour in the dark with the light
turned off to get the adsorption–desorption equilibrium. After
light irradiation, about 5 mL of the suspension was taken every 0.5
h and centrifuged to remove the photocatalysts and get a clear solution
in the upper level, of which the absorption spectrum was obtained
by a Shimadzu UV-2050 spectrophotometer.

The experiments of
the active species trapping were carried out with the aim to explore
the active species involved during the degradation process and the
possible photocatalytic mechanism. A certain amount of AO, BQ, and
IPA was introduced into the reaction suspensions to capture the possible
active species, such as hole (h+), superoxide radical (•O2–), and hydroxyl radical
(•OH), respectively. N2 and O2 gases were also bubbled into the reaction system to further confirm
the active species. To test the stability and reusability of the BDCN
nanocomposite photocatalyst, the BDCN4 nanocomposite photocatalyst
was centrifuged and collected after the photocatalytic test experiment,
dried in 80 °C, and redispersed into the fresh phenol or MO solution.
The recycling photocatalytic reaction was repeated under the same
condition for successive five times, and the XRD pattern of the BDCN4
sample was recorded and compared with that of the original sample
to detect any degradation of the photocatalyst after each photocatalytic
run.

4.4 Electrochemical Analysis
An electrochemical
analyzer (CHI-660E, Chenhua, China) was used to test the electrochemical
properties of the samples in a conventional three-electrode cell.
The working electrodes were made by the doctor-blading method. A Pt
sheet was used as a counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl electrode was
used as a reference electrode. The Na2SO4 aqueous
solution (1.0 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The area exposed in the solution
and illuminated by the lamp was
0.25 cm2. With a voltage of 0.5 V bias versus Ag/AgCl and
a perturbation signal of 10 mV with a frequency at 1 kHz set, the
periodic on/off photocurrent response of the modified fluorine-doped
tin oxide glass (FTO) was measured.
