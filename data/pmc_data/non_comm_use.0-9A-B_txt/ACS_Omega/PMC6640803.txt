The
oxidative coupling of benzylamines proceeds efficiently using
salicylic acid derivatives as organocatalysts under an oxygen atmosphere,
affording the corresponding N-benzylidenebenzylamines
in high yields. Electron-rich salicylic acid derivatives such as 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic
acid and 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid exhibit excellent catalytic activities
for the oxidative coupling of benzylamines to give the corresponding
imines. This amine oxidation can also be applied to the synthesis
of nitrogen-containing heterocycles such as benzimidazole derivatives.
Furthermore, to recycle the catalyst, silica gel supported with 4.7
wt % of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid is prepared, which acts as a recyclable
catalyst, oxidizing benzylamine to imine four times successfully.

Introduction
Imines are of great
importance for the synthesis of industrial
materials and biologically active compounds such as amines, chiral
amines, amides, pyrrolines, oxaziridines, hydroxyamines, and nitrones.1−3 To synthesize imines, many useful oxidation methods have been developed,4 which include oxidation of primary or secondary
amines and oxidative condensation of amines with alcohols. Typical
strategies require transition metal catalysts including noble metals5−9 and non-noble biocompatible metals;10−14 however, contamination of the final products by these
metal residues becomes a serious problem in the synthesis of medicines
and functional materials. From the perspective of green chemistry,
chemists have shifted their attention to other, more eco-friendly
methods. Metal-free catalysts such as graphene oxide,15 4-tert-butyl-2-hydroxybenzoquinone (TBHBQ),16 and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN)17 can oxidize benzylic amines to secondary imines.
In biology, copper-containing amine oxidases (CuAOs) have high activity
and specificity toward the oxidation of primary amines. Thus, bioinspired
catalysts, electrogenerated ortho-iminoquinone species,18ortho-quinone,19 and other mimicry of monoamine oxidase compounds,20 were used. Visible-light-induced transformation
of amines to imines is also an alternative approach; allowing different
kinds of photocatalyses to be investigated.21−24 However, most of these metal-free
catalysts are of complex structure and high price. Therefore, the
development of more easily available metal-free catalysts for imine
synthesis is still desired strongly.

Recently, we have reported
a series of eco-friendly oxidations
of alcohols and amines using metal catalysts: for example, the vanadium
complex-catalyzed oxidation of benzyl alcohols25 or benzylamines with atmospheric O2 in water
or ionic liquid26 and the copper sulfate-catalyzed
oxidation of amines with H2O2 in water27 (Scheme 1, eqs 1 and 2, respectively). In the former catalytic oxidation,
3-hydroxypicolinic acid (H2hpic) or its analogues were
used as ligands for oxovanadium complexes. During these studies, we
were surprised to find that some of the ligands such as salicylic
acid and its derivatives themselves functioned as organocatalysts
and catalyzed amine oxidation (Scheme 1, eq 3).

Scheme 1 Catalytic Oxidation of Amines to Imines
Herein, we report a convenient,
salicylic acid derivative-catalyzed
oxidation of benzylamines to the corresponding imines under an atmosphere
of O2. Furthermore, this new metal-free oxidation method
can be applied to the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles
such as benzimidazole derivatives. Moreover, the recyclability of
the organocatalyst has been demonstrated successfully by supporting
4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid on silica gel.

Results and Discussion
Initially, H2hpic, which was used as a ligand for the
vanadium catalyst in our previous work, was used alone (in the absence
of metal catalyst) for the oxidation of benzylamine 1a under an O2 atmosphere; interestingly, the formation
of the desired product 2a was observed (Scheme 1, eq 3). Hence, we next explored
the functional subunits of H2hpic, such as the phenol and
benzoic acid groups, and their combinations, by using them as catalysts
for the amine oxidation (for details, see Table S1). Phenol and benzoic acid are ineffective for the transformation.
Surprisingly, salicylic acid is found to have great catalytic activity
for the oxidation of benzylamine under O2, affording N-benzylidenebenzylamine 2a in 80% yield. However,
2-methoxybenzoic acid or methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate is less effective
than salicylic acid itself. Introduction of a methylene group between
the carboxylic acid and phenyl groups also reduces the yield of 2a. On the other hand, simple Brønsted acids such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and acetic acid, which have recently
been reported to promote the oxidation of amines,28 are ineffective.

To optimize the catalyst for this
metal-free oxidation, the amine
oxidation was examined using several salicylic acid derivatives (Table 1). 4-Substituted salicylic
acids demonstrated almost the same reactivity as nonsubstituted salicylic
acid after 24 h (entries 1, 3, and 5). However, at a shorter reaction
time (12 h), 4-methoxysalicylic acid 3c showed higher
reactivity than the others (entries 2, 4, and 6). Further optimization
revealed that 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic acid 3d as a catalyst
was the most efficient in this metal-free oxidation, affording the
desired product in 95% yield (entry 9). To compare with other organocatalysts
that have been reported by other research groups, we examined the
amine oxidation using AIBN,17 TBHBQ,16 and ortho-quinone19 under our optimized reaction conditions. TBHBQ
and ortho-quinone indicated similar catalytic ability
with our catalyst 3d (entries 12 and 13), whereas a lower
yield of the corresponding imine was obtained in the case of AIBN
as the catalyst (entry 11).

Catalyzed
Using Salicylic Acid Derivatives
a Determined by 1H NMR
using 1,3,5-trioxane (isolated

on substrate 1a.

Using the optimized reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 9), the oxidation of different benzylamine
substrates was examined (Table 2). Benzylamine derivatives with electron-donating [1c (R = p-Me), 1f (R = p-OMe), and 1g (R = p-tBu)] or electron-withdrawing [1e (R = m-OMe), 1h (R = p-Cl), and 1i (R = p-CF3)] groups at the para- or meta-position can be oxidized
to the corresponding imines in high yields. It is noteworthy that
sterically hindered ortho-substituted benzylic amines 1b (R = o-Me) and 1d (R = o-OMe) undergo oxidative coupling efficiently. Besides,
similar oxidation of activated primary amines such as 1-naphthylmethylamine 1j, furfurylamine 1k, 2-pyridinemethylamine 1l, and 2-thiophenemethyamine 1m was examined.
1-Naphthylmethylamine and 2-thiophenemethyamine can be transformed
into the corresponding imines in good yields. By contrast, the oxidation
of secondary amines, aliphatic amines, and 4-hydroxybenzylamine was
difficult under these conditions. On the other hand, benzylamine featuring
primary or secondary alcohol underwent oxidative coupling to afford
the corresponding imines in moderate yield (for details, see Scheme S1).29

b Reaction time: 8 h.

The
successful synthesis of imine derivatives prompted us to apply
this method to the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives. The benzimidazole
skeleton is an important structural framework found in a large variety
of naturally occurring compounds and pharmaceutical agents. Conventionally,
numerous methods have been reported for the construction of benzimidazoles.
For example, several efficient methods for the synthesis of benzimidazoles
from alcohols,30 benzaldehydes,31 imines,32 β-diketones,33 and carboxylic acids34 as well as intermolecular condensation of 1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-ones35 have recently been
developed. Besides, examples of benzimidazole synthesis through the
cyclization of 1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives with benzylamines under
metal36,37 or metal-free24,38−42 oxidation conditions have also been reported recently. Owing to
the importance of developing a new metal-free oxidative system for
the synthesis of benzimidazoles, we applied our oxidation protocol
to the synthesis of benzimidazole derivatives (Table 3).

a Determined

using 1,3,5-trioxane as the internal standard (isolated yield); yield
of 5a is based on substrate 4a.

When the reaction of 1a with 1,2-diaminobenzene 4a (1 equiv) was performed
at 90 °C in the presence of
salicylic acid derivative 3d as the organocatalyst, the
desired product 5a was obtained successfully in 83% yield
(Table 3, entry 1).
Apparently, the use of 1.5 equiv of 1a at a higher temperature
can slightly improve the yield of 5a (entries 2 and 3).
However, a shorter or longer reaction time resulted in a decrease
in the yield of 5a (entries 4 and 5), and this oxidation
reaction could not proceed well at 60 °C (entry 6).

Under
the optimized conditions (Table 3, entry 3), the salicylic acid derivative-catalyzed
cyclization of several benzylamine derivatives 1 with
1,2-diaminobenzene 4a was demonstrated and the corresponding
benzimidazoles 5 were obtained in high yields (Table 4, 5a–h). Many substituents on the phenyl group of benzylamine, such as p-Me, o-MeO, m-MeO, p-MeO, m-Cl, p-Cl, and p-CF3, were tolerant to the oxidative cyclization.
Moreover, several 1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives 4 were
also screened. Electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on
the aromatic ring of 1,2-diaminobenzenes were well-tolerated under
these cyclization reaction conditions, and the desired benzimidazoles 5 were obtained in good yields (Table 4, 5i–n).

Benzylamine and 1,2-Diaminobenzene Derivativesa
a Yield of isolated
product is based
on 4 (1H NMR yield was determined using 1,3,5-trioxane
as the internal standard).

To clarify the mechanism of this oxidation reaction, we performed
several control experiments as shown in Scheme 2 (eqs 4–8). At first, as we suspected
that the oxidation of benzylamine proceeds following a radical pathway,
the radical scavenger TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl
free radical) was added to the reaction mixture under the standard
conditions (Scheme 2, eq 4). As a result, the yield of the desired imine 2a dramatically decreased to 5%. Moreover, the formation of 6 was confirmed using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) (m/z = 157 corresponding
to 6). These results strongly suggest that the oxidation
involves radical species. The findings in Table 1 clearly indicate that the salicylic acid
structure is important for this oxidation. To further clarify the
role of the salicylic acid derivatives, compound 7 was
prepared from benzylamine 1a and salicylic acid derivative 3d (Scheme 2, eq 5) and then subjected to the optimized oxidation conditions.
However, the imine product 2a was generated in only 6%
yield (Scheme 2, eq
6). Adding benzylamine 1a (1 equiv) improved the yield
to 43% (Scheme 2, eq
7), suggesting that the oxidation requires free amine 1a. Furthermore, the catalytic oxidation of 1a using 7 as a catalyst successfully afforded 2a in 97%
yield (Scheme 2, eq
7). In the absence of salicylic acid derivative 3d, the
oxidative coupling of benzylamine to imine could not proceed at all
(Scheme 2, eq 8).

Scheme 2 Control Experiments
On the basis of these results, a possible catalytic pathway
is
proposed in Scheme 3. First, benzylamine 1a and salicylic acid derivative 3d form the corresponding salt 7, which may be
oxidized by O2 to generate phenoxy radical 8 and HOO•. The hydrogen abstraction from benzylamine leads
to the formation of 9. Further hydrogen abstraction from
the amino group by HOO• affords phenylmethanimine 10 with regeneration of the catalyst 7; then intermediate 10 undergoes amino group exchange reaction with benzylamine 1a to afford 2a.

Scheme 3 Possible Pathway
for the Catalytic Oxidation of Benzylamine
In view of green chemistry, recyclability of the catalyst
is of
great importance. Hence, we examined the preparation of silica gel-supported
salicylic acid as a recyclable organocatalyst to develop the recyclable
amine oxidation method (Scheme 4). To obtain the silica gel-supported 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic
acid 3d catalyst, silica gel was treated with 3d. However, 3d could not be supported efficiently on
silica gel, and during the washing process of the silica gel with
ethyl acetate, most of 3d was removed from the silica
gel (Scheme 4, eq 9).
Considering the affinity with silica gel, 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e(43) was chosen as the organocatalyst.
As we expected, silica gel supported with 4.7 wt % of 3e (4.7 wt % 3e on silica gel) was obtained successfully
(Scheme 4, eq 10).
Then, the silica gel-supported catalyst (4.7 wt % 3e on
silica gel) was used for the oxidation of benzylamine 1a to imine 2a (Table 5). Compared with 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e itself, the silica gel-supported catalyst (4.7 wt % 3e on silica gel) showed a similar catalytic activity (entries
1 and 2). On the other hand, the silica gel itself did not indicate
any catalytic activity for the imine oxidation (entry 3).

using 1,3,5-trioxane as the internal standard; yield of 2a is based on substrate 1a; N.R.: no reaction.

Then, recyclability of the silica
gel-supported catalyst (4.7 wt
% 3e on the silica gel) was examined (Table 6). The oxidation of benzylamine 1a was conducted using silica gel-supported 3e, and the corresponding imine 2a was obtained in 84%
yield (first run). The resulting silica gel-supported 3e was recovered by filtration, and reused for the second oxidation.
The yield of 2a was 95% (second run). Similarly, third
and fourth oxidations were conducted, and the yields of 2a were 64% (third run) and 53% (fourth run), respectively. To confirm
the reproducibility of this recycling study, the same oxidation and
recycling were attempted; similar results were obtained, as indicated
in the second row of Table 6. In the second run, imine 2a was obtained in
a higher yield than in the first run. This is probably because some
of 1a and/or 2a was absorbed by the silica
gel in the first run and could not be washed away from the catalyst.
After the reaction, the surface of the silica gel-supported catalyst
was covered with an unidentified black compound that was hard to clean
up. As a result, the catalyst was deactivated to some degree, and
the yields of the third and fourth runs gradually decreased.

a Yield of 2a is based
on substrate 1a, and determined by 1H NMR

As can be seen from the recycling
experiments (Table 6), 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e is also an effective
catalyst for the oxidative coupling
of benzylamines to imines. Thus, we further investigate the oxidative
coupling of benzylamines using 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e as the catalyst (Table 7). Compared with 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic acid 3d, 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e indicated further excellent
catalytic activity and induced the oxidative coupling in a shorter
time (2 h).44 Although the reason why 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid 3e exhibits a higher catalytic activity compared
with 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic acid 3d is not clear, a better
electron-donating ability of the hydroxyl group [Hammett’s
σ value = −0.37 (p-OH)] compared with
that of the methoxyl group [σ value = −0.27 (p-OMe)] might contribute to the efficiency in the present
oxidation by increasing the electron density of the organocatalyst.
By using the catalyst 3e, the gram scale synthesis of
imine 2a was examined starting from 10 mmol of 1a (1.07 g), and 0.72 g (3.7 mmol, 74% isolated yield) of 2a was obtained successfully, as shown in Table 7.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have explored a novel metal-free oxidation method
to synthesize imines and benzimidazoles from benzylamine derivatives.
In this oxidative transformation, the products can be obtained under
an atmosphere of oxygen in good to high yields by using salicylic
acid derivatives as organocatalysts. Furthermore, the silica gel-supported
catalyst realized the oxidative coupling and could attain the recyclability
of the catalyst. This oxidation system is cheap, efficient, and eco-friendly
and can be easily operated. Further investigations of metal-free oxidations
are currently under way.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
Unless otherwise stated, all benzylamine
derivatives, analogues of H2hpic, salicylic acid derivatives,
and silica Q-10C (pore volume = 0.8 cm3/g; size = 0.85–1.76
mm) were obtained from commercial supplies. All solvents were distilled
and degassed with nitrogen before use. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded on a JEOL JNM-ECS400 (400 MHz) FT NMR system or a JEOL JNM-ECX400
(400 MHz) FT NMR system in CDCl3 and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-d6 with Me4Si as the
internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL
JNM-ECX400 (100 MHz) FT NMR system or a JEOL JNM-ECS400 (100 MHz)
FT NMR system in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Imine Derivatives 2
Benzylamine derivatives 1 (3.0 mmol),
4,6-dimethoxysalicylic acid 3d (5.0 mol %), and distilled
toluene (1.5 mL) were added into a two-neck flask, the reaction vessel
was connected to an O2 balloon at room temperature, and
the mixture was stirred at 90 °C under an O2 atmosphere
for 6 h. After the reaction was complete, the resulting mixture was
transferred into a round-bottom flask using ethyl acetate and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The residue was purified using gel permeation
chromatography (eluent: chloroform) to give the product 2.

General Procedure
for the Synthesis of Benzimidazole Derivatives 5
Benzylamine derivatives 1 (1.5 mmol),
1,2-diaminobenzene derivatives 4 (1.0 mmol), 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic
acid 3d (5.0 mol %), and distilled toluene (0.5 mL) were
added into a two-neck flask, and the reaction vessel was connected
with an O2 balloon at room temperature. The mixture was
stirred at 110 °C under an O2 atmosphere for 12 h.
After the reaction was complete, the resulting mixture was transferred
into a round-bottom flask using methanol (MeOH) and concentrated under
reduced pressure. The residue was purified using silica gel chromatography
[basified by Et3N (25 wt %)] {eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate
[added Et3N (1.0 v/v %)]} to give the product 5.

Experimental Procedure
for the Synthesis of 4.7 wt % 3e on Silica Gel
Silica Q-10C (5.0 g, pore volume = 0.8 cm3/g, size = 0.85–1.76
mm) was added into a Kugelrohr
distillation apparatus and dried at 150 °C (0.5 Torr) for 5 h
to give dried silica Q-10C (4.92 g). Then, the dried silica Q-10C
was mixed with 4,6-dihydroxy salicylic acid (3e, 493.6
mg, 10 wt % of dried silica Q-10C) and 10 mL of ethyl acetate in a
round-bottom flask, and the resulting mixture was kept static for
12 h. After concentration by vacuum, the catalyst was dried using
the Kugelrohr apparatus at 150 °C (1.1 Torr) for 5 h. The resultant
small brown ball was washed using ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3).
The filter cake was concentrated by vacuum and further dried using
the Kugelrohr apparatus at 150 °C (0.8 Torr) for 6 h to afford
4.7 wt % 3e on silica gel (5.16 g).

Experimental
Procedure for Recycling Study
Benzylamine 1a (321.4 mg, 3.0 mmol), catalyst 4.7 wt % 3e on silica
gel (542.9 mg, 0.15 mol), and distilled toluene (1.5 mL)
were added into a two-neck flask, and the reaction vessel was connected
with an O2 balloon at room temperature. After stirring
at 90 °C under an O2 atmosphere for 2 h, the reaction
mixture was filtered. The filter cake was washed using ethyl acetate
(5 mL × 3) and dried by vacuum to recover the catalyst 4.7 wt
% 3e on silica gel, which was used for the next run directly.
The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and detected
using 1H NMR to calculate the yield of product 2a (84% for the first run).

Recovery of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid 3e was also conducted using acid–base extraction.
After
the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was concentrated in
vacuo, the residue was added to a 15% NaOH aqueous solution, and the
product was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Evaporation of the
organic layer successfully afforded 2a in 71% yield.
In this treatment, the Na salt of 3e might be moved to
the aqueous layer. Thus, the aqueous layer was acidified with 3 N
HCl, and extraction with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) was performed. Unfortunately,
however, the organic layer did not contain 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid 3e, most probably due to the decomposition of the
catalyst 3e. Therefore, further detailed optimization
of reaction and extraction conditions is required for recovery of
the catalyst 3e.


The oxidative coupling of benzylamine to
the corresponding imine was conducted using 4-hydroxybenzoic acid
and the related hydroxyl substituted benzoic acids (2,4-dihydroxybonzoic
acid, 2,6-dihydroxybonzoic acid, and salicylic acid itself), and the
results are shown in Table S2 in the Supporting
Information. As can be seen from Table S2, these organocatalysts were all less effective compared with 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid 3e, clearly indicating that the present oxidative
coupling of benzylamines requires 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid 3e (or 4,6-dimethoxysalicylic acid 3d) as organocatalyst.
