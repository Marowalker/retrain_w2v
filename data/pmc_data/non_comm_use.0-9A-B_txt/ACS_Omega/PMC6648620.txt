Pyrazines
are renowned heterocyclic compounds that have played
an important role in drug design and are part of many polycyclic compounds
of biological and industrial significance. In this article, a novel
chitosan-immobilized ionic liquid, [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS, has been synthesized easily
at ambient temperature and used for catalyzing the synthesis of a
series of biologically relevant pyrazine derivatives. The catalyst
is well characterized by various techniques such as Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state 13C MAS nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive
X-ray, elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy, powder
X-ray diffraction, and thermal gravimetric analyses. The advantageous
features of the present energy-sustainable methodology include high

1 Introduction
Over
the last few decades, the popularity of ionic liquids (ILs)
has significantly increased because of their unique properties such
as non-inflammability, non-volatility, low vapor pressure, high chemical
and thermal stability, environmental compatibility, high selectivity,
potential recoverability, greater selectivity, and so forth.1 Because of these properties, ILs have been extensively
employed in organic synthesis as green solvents and reagents,2 catalysis,3 electrochemistry,4 and liquid–liquid extraction.5 Many ILs, having a Brønsted acidic character,
show useful characteristics of solid acids and mineral liquid acids.
Because of these properties, these ILs have been designed to replace
conventional mineral liquid acids, such as sulfuric acid and hydrochloric
acid, in a variety of organic transformations.6 Solvent-free synthesis using ILs has attracted considerable attention
from a green chemistry view point.7 Among
the ILs, sulfonic acid-functionalized imidazolium salts have been
used as homogeneous catalysts in various organic transformations such
as protection of hydroxyl groups,8 nitration
of phenols,9 synthesis of N-sulfonyl imines,10 bis(indolyl)methanes,11 benzimidazoles,12 and so forth.

One of the major drawbacks of homogeneous catalysis
using ILs is
the use of excess of ILs as a solvent or a catalyst producing a large
amount of waste materials. Moreover, disposal of these waste materials
is extremely difficult which makes the overall process unacceptable
from an environmental view point. To avoid the limitations of homogeneous
catalysis involving ILs, various ILs have been immobilized on solid
supports to combine the advantages of ILs and heterogeneous support
materials.13 For this, different support
materials such as chitosan,14 silica,15 graphene oxide,16 zeolite,17 and so forth have been used
so far to synthesize supported ILs as heterogeneous catalysts. Among
the solid support materials, chitosan, a natural biopolymer, is an
excellent support material because of its exclusive properties such
as unique three-dimensional structure, biodegradable nature, chemical
reactivity due to the presence of hydroxyl and amino groups, excellent
chelating and mechanical properties, and so forth.18 Particularly, IL-based catalysts have been widely used
in various organic reactions such as Baeyer–Villiger reactions,19 hydroformylation,20 hydrogenation,21 alkylations,22 nitration,20a and
acetal formation.23 Moreover, IL-based
materials have also found application in electrochemical detection
of atrazine in wastewater,24a determination of rutin,24b determination of ceftizoxime,24c electrochemical
sensing of ractopamine,24d sensing of raloxifene,24e and electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol.24f

Pyrazine constitutes an important class
of nitrogen containing
heterocyclic compounds that have been very much exploited for their
interesting pharmaceutical and biological activities such as anti-thrombotic,25 COX-2 inhibiting, and analgesic effects;26 relaxing cardiovascular and uterine smooth muscles;27 antifungal,28a antibacterial,28a antitubercular,28a anticancer,28b antimalarial,29 and
antimicrobial30 properties, and so forth.

In view of our ongoing research on supported heterogeneous catalysts,31 combining the advantages of IL and solid support
materials, we, herein, report an efficient method for the synthesis
of a chitosan-supported IL, [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS, at ambient temperature. The supported
IL has been studied for its catalytic activity by synthesizing a library
of biologically important pyrazines.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of the Catalyst
The catalyst, [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS, was synthesized as
outlined in Scheme 1 and well-characterized by
various techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
Raman spectroscopy, solid-state 13C MAS NMR, scanning electron
microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX), elemental mapping, transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal
gravimetric analysis (TGA).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS
FTIR spectra of pure chitosan,
disulfonyl imidazolium chloride
([DSIM]Cl–), [DSIM]AlCl4–, [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS, and recycled catalyst are shown in Figure 1. The spectrum of chitosan (Figure 1a) showed a characteristic
broad peak at 3421 cm–1 which corresponded to −OH
and −NH stretching vibrations of the chitosan framework, whereas
the −CH stretching mode of methylene groups of chitosan appeared
at 2923 cm–1. The other bands centered at 1589,
1381, and 1078 cm–1 corresponded to N–H bending,
C–N stretching, and C–OH stretching vibrations, respectively.31c In Figure 1b, a broad band at 3392 cm–1 indicated
the presence of two OH groups of a SO3H moiety in the IL
system.32 The bands at 1626 and 1588 cm–1 were assigned to C=C and C=N stretching
vibrations,32 respectively, whereas the
stretching band of the SO3H group appeared at 1192 cm–1.33 The other peaks at
1179, 1050, and 885 were assigned to S–O symmetric stretching,
S–O antisymmetric stretching, and N–S stretching vibrations,
respectively,32 whereas the band centered
at 576 cm–1 attributed to the bending vibration
of the SO3H group. When [DSIM]Cl– was
treated with AlCl3, no significant change in the FTIR spectrum
of [DSIM]AlCl4– was observed in the range
of 400–4000 cm–1 (Figure 1c). However, the presence of [(AlCl3)x–] was confirmed
by the Raman spectrum of the catalyst (Figure 2b). In the spectrum of [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS (Figure 1d), the characteristic peaks
for chitosan appeared at their appropriate values with some additional
bands at 1626, 1194, 1054, and 579 cm–1 which were
due to presence of IL {[DSIM]AlCl4–}.
The N–H bending mode of chitosan merged with C=N stretching
vibration of the IL and appeared at 1583 cm–1. The
band centered at 534 cm–1 was due to the Al–N
and Al–O bond (Figure 1d).34

Raman spectra of pure chitosan
and catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS were obtained
in the range of 150–1650 cm–1 and are shown
in Figure 2. The presence
of bands at 942.04, 1101.47, and 1142.29 cm–1 was
attributed to the out-of-plane vibration of the amine group,35 C–O–C stretching vibration,19 and C–N stretching vibrations36 of chitosan, respectively (Figure 2a). The strong band at 349.72
cm–1 was assigned to the (AlCl3)x– ion present in the catalyst37 (Figure 2b).

In the solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectrum
of the catalyst,
two signals at 56.45 and 61.07 ppm were assigned to C2 and
C6 carbons of chitosan, whereas other signals present at
74.98, 83.72, and 101.68 ppm were attributed to C3, C4, and C1 carbons, respectively (Figure 3). The two signals at 23.60
ppm and 175.14 were assigned to the N-glucosamine
unit of chitosan.38 The carbon atoms of
the imidazolium cation (Ca and Cb) appeared
at 120.79 and 135.64 ppm, respectively.39

The surface morphology of chitosan showed clean
surfaces (Figure 4a,b),
but a morphological
change was obtained when IL ([DSIM][AlCl4–) was supported on chitosan (Figure 4c,d). EDX analysis (Figure 5) confirmed the presence of C, N, S, O, Cl,
and Al elements, whereas elemental mapping of the catalyst indicated
the uniform distribution of these elements (Figure 6a–f) which confirmed the formation
of a desired catalytic system, that is, [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS.

TEM images of chitosan and the catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS are shown in Figure 7. The presence of
IL [DSIM]AlCl4– on the surface of chitosan,
clearly shown in Figure 7b, further ascertains the proper immobilization of the IL on chitosan
to form [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS.

TGA of the catalyst showed two-stage
decomposition. First thermal
decomposition at 244.94 °C (weight loss = 41.023%) was due to
depolymerization and decomposition of the glucosamine unit of chitosan
and absorbed moisture which was trapped during synthesis of the catalyst.40 Second thermal decomposition at 457.44 °C
(weight loss = 55.642%) was attributed to some other changes in the
catalytic system such as oxidative decomposition of the chitosan moiety41 and removal of the organic functional group
such as the sulfonyl group (SO3H) of IL incorporated in
the material framework (Figure 8).42

Figure 8 TGA of the catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS.

In the XRD spectrum of the catalyst,
the appearance of characteristic
broad peaks at 2θ = 10° and 20° was attributed to
the chitosan moiety (Figure 9a).43 The IL supported chitosan showed a similar XRD pattern to that of
chitosan which was due to the low amount and uniform distribution
of IL on the surface of the chitosan.

2.2 Catalytic Activity
In order to select
the most suitable reaction conditions, a reaction involving 1,2 diketone 1a (2 mmol) and diamine 2b (2 mmol) to give pyrazine 3a at room temperature was chosen as the model reaction (Scheme 2) for optimizing
different reaction parameters such as different catalysts, solvents,
catalyst loadings, and catalyst amounts. First, we investigated the
effect of different catalysts on the model reaction. It was observed
that chitosan alone could not catalyze the reaction effectively and
afforded low yield of the product in a longer reaction time (Table 1, entry 1). The reaction
was then tested with sulfonyl imidazolium ILs with different anions
such as [DSIM]Cl–, [DSIM]HSO4–, and [DSIM]CH3COO– (Table 1, entries 2–4). Among
these ILs, [DSIM]Cl– catalyzed the reaction more
effectively than others (Table 1, entry 2). To improve the yield and reduce the reaction time
period, [DSIM]Cl– was further treated with different
metal salts to form new IL systems such as {[DSIM]AlCl4–}, {[DSIM]FeCl4–},
{[DSIM]NiCl4–}, and {[DSIM]ZnCl4–} (Table 1, entries 5–8). It was observed that among the ILs
containing metal halide anions, best results were obtained with {[DSIM]AlCl4–} in terms of product yield and reaction
time (Table 1, entry
5).

The above results
showed that the rate of reaction was affected
by changing the anions of ILs and hence confirmed that the model reaction
was catalyzed by the synergic effect of both cations and anions present
in the catalysts (Table 1, entries 2–8). Furthermore, in order to choose an appropriate
support material, the model reaction was carried out with the IL supported
on SiO2, ZrO2, and chitosan (Table 1, entries 9–11). Among
these materials, chitosan was found as the best material for the said
reaction.

A pH test was performed for [DSIM]Cl–, [DSIM]AlCl4–, and [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS and pH
values were found to
be 1.2, 1.8, and 3.4, respectively. This confirmed that the final
catalyst was acidic in nature because of the presence of sulfonic
acid groups in the catalytic system. The exact role of the catalyst
composition can be to provide the synergic effects of cationic and
anionic parts leading to increased activity. Individually, the role
of the imidazolium cation was to provide enough acidity to the catalyst
(pH = 1.2) due to the presence of sulfonic acid groups which activated
the carbonyl carbons of diketones to facilitate the reaction,32 the presence of AlCl4– provided the lewis acidic sites to bind with hydroxyl and amine
groups of chitosan,20a and the role of
chitosan was to introduce heterogeneity into the catalyst.

We
then examined the model reaction with various green solvents
such as isopropanol, water, dimethyl sulfoxide, polyethylene glycols
(PEGs) (200 400 600), methanol, and ethanol (Figure 10) and also under solvent-free conditions.
It was found that moderate to good yields of the product were obtained
when the reaction was carried out with green solvents (Figure 10, entries 1–7). On
the other hand, solvent-free reaction conditions afforded excellent
yield in a minimum reaction time (Figure 10, entry 8).

the model reaction (reaction conditions: benzil 1a (2
mmol), o-phenylenediamine 2b (2 mmol),
[DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS (100 mg), T = 25 °C, and
stirring).

In order to find out
the optimum loading amount of {[DSIM]AlCl4–} on chitosan, the model reaction was carried
out with different loading amounts varying from 5 to 25% w/w (Figure 11). It was observed
that the maximum product yield was obtained with 25% w/w loading (Figure 11, entry 4).

[DSIM]AlCl4– loading on
the support for the model reaction (reaction conditions: benzil 1a (2 mmol), o-phenylenediamine 2b (2 mmol), [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS (100 mg), T = 25 °C, and
stirring).

The amount of the catalyst
suitable to catalyze the reaction was
checked by varying the amount of catalyst (30, 50, 60, 80, and 100
mg) in the model reaction. It was found that the yield of the product
increased on increasing the amount of the catalyst from 30 to 100
mg (Figure 12). Thus,
the optimum amount of catalyst required for the maximum conversion
of the reactant to product was found to be 100 mg (Figure 12, entry 5).

conditions: benzil 1a (2 mmol), o-phenylenediamine 2b (2 mmol), [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS (30–100 mg), T = 25 °C, and stirring).

After ascertaining optimized reaction conditions, a series
of pyrazine
derivatives were synthesized using an equimolar ratio of diamines
and diketones in the presence of the catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS under solvent-free
conditions at room temperature (Scheme 3).

Many efficient heterogeneous catalysts have been reported for the
synthesis of pyrazine derivatives. A comparison with these catalytic
systems reveals that the present catalyst was more efficient in terms
of time period and reaction temperature (Table 2).

2.3 Stability and Recycling
Study of the Catalyst
Furthermore, recycling capability of
the catalyst was tested by
choosing the model reaction of benzil 1a and o-phenylene diamine 2b in the presence of 100
mg of the catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS under solvent-free conditions at room
temperature. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was separated
from the reaction mixture by extraction with ethyl acetate. The catalyst
was found to be active up to six runs with insignificant changes (Figure 13). The FTIR spectrum
of the recycled catalyst after the sixth run showed a similar pattern
of peaks to that of the fresh catalyst showing characteristic bands
of chitosan and IL system at 3419, 1628, 1588, 1193, 1076, and 534
cm–1 (Figure 1e). The morphology of the recycled catalyst was almost similar
to that of the fresh catalyst (Figure 4e,f). An XRD pattern of the recycled catalyst was also
found to be similar to that of the fresh catalyst (Figure 9c).

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized an efficient chitosan-based IL
easily at ambient temperature. The catalyst shows good stability and
is found to be a suitable catalyst for the synthesis of six-membered
nitrogen heterocycles such as pyrazines. Simple operational procedure,
cost-effectiveness, high yield, and short reaction time period are
added features of the present energy sustainable protocol.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS
The IL, [DSIM]Cl–, was prepared by the reported
procedure.48 Imidazole (0.340 g, 5 mmol)
was taken in a round-bottom
(100 mL) flask containing 50 mL dry CH2Cl2,
and chlorosulfonic acid (1.1885 g, 10.2 mmol) was added drop-wise
over a period of 20 min at room temperature. After the complete addition,
the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h under inert atmosphere and
stood for 5 min. A viscous pale yellow oil, settled down at the bottom,
was separated using a separating funnel, washed with dry CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL), and dried under vacuum to get [DSIM]Cl– as a viscous pale yellow oil. In the second step,
AlCl3 was added to the prepared [DSIM]Cl– and the mixture was heated at 50 °C for 30 min to get [DSIM]AlCl4–. The final catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS was obtained
by employing an impregnation method. Chitosan powder was suspended
in the mixture containing IL [DSIM]AlCl4– in CH2Cl2 for 4 h. Excess solvent was evaporated
to dryness to give the catalyst [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS as yellowish brown powder.

4.2 General Procedure for Synthesis of Pyrazine
Derivatives 3a–n
A mixture of diketones 1a–e (2 mmol), diamines 2a–c (2
mmol), and [DSIM][AlCl3]x–@CS (100 mg) was stirred at room temperature for 1–2
min. The reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). After completion of the reaction, ethyl acetate was added to
the reaction mixture. The catalyst was filtered, washed with ethanol
thrice, and dried in an oven for reuse. The ethyl acetate solution
was concentrated and kept at room temperature to afford the products
(3a–n). Recrystallization of products was carried
out with ethanol.
