NiP
alloys are very often used in industry, due to their outstanding
performance in corrosion and wear. Alloys with high phosphorus content
(≥16 atom % P) are amorphous and show high corrosion resistance
in both neutral and acidic solutions irrespective of the presence
of chloride ions. The reason for this behavior is attributed to the
formation of a “P-enriched surface layer” whose exact
nature is still under debate. In this work, an iterative algorithm
based on the application of maximum entropy method on nondestructive
angle-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data has been applied
to the investigation of the surface layer grown on Ni18P alloys following
mechanical polishing and anodic polarization in sulfate solutions.
The results show that the outermost region of the examined alloy has
a complex layered structure: (1) an uppermost hydrocarbon contamination
layer about 1 nm thick, which includes also adsorbed water; (2) a
nickel (poly)phosphate layer of about 1 nm; (3) a highly phosphorus-enriched
interface being about 2 nm thick with a marked phosphorus concentration
gradient, from 70 to 20 atom %; and (4) bulk alloy with the stoichiometric
composition. These findings, together with the chemical state of the
different phosphorus compounds, allow us to conclude that the high
corrosion and wear resistance of NiP alloys might be ascribed to the
presence of a thin, self-repairing nickel (poly)phosphate layer grown
on a strongly P-enriched interface. Because the Auger parameter of
P at the interface is similar to that of elemental P, it might be
also concluded that the interface is enriched in elemental phosphorus.

Introduction
NiP alloys have been
exploited
as coatings to prevent corrosion on a commercial scale since the 1950s.1,2 The interest toward nanocrystalline NiP alloys is due to their properties,
such as hardness and good wear performance,3,4 low
friction coefficient, nonmagnetic behavior,5 and high electrocatalytic activity.6 These
alloys are currently used in electronic industry7,8 and
Ni-P/X composites, where X = SiC, WC, Al2O3,
and TiO29 have been developed
due to their improved wear and corrosion resistance. One of the most
important functional properties of NiP alloys is their outstanding
corrosion resistance in neutral and acidic solutions. In the potential
range, where pure Ni dissolves actively, NiP alloys with near-eutectic
composition of about 18–20 atom % P and an amorphous microstructure
exhibit suppression of the anodic dissolution.10−16

According to the literature, this high corrosion resistance
is
attributed to a P-enriched surface layer, whose exact chemical nature
and composition and especially the in-depth composition profile are
still controversial. The improved corrosion performance was related
by various authors to the presence of a nickel phosphate film,17,18 hypophosphites (called “chemical passivity”),19,20 phosphides,21 or a stable P-enriched
amorphous phase.21−24 There was agreement in stating
that this layer should be localized between the surface layer and
the bulk alloy.17−23

On the basis of a combined electrochemical10 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface analytical
study,25 the authors explained the corrosion
behavior
of NiP alloys, taking into account the “elemental” phosphorus
enrichment at the interface between the surface film and the bulk
alloy. However, no detailed mechanistic explanation of the formation
conditions, growth kinetics, and high stability of NiP alloys has
yet been provided, mainly because of the lack of in-depth composition
profile information of the thin surface film.

Ion sputtering
composition versus depth profiling yields good in-depth
resolution, but this is a destructive technique and may result in
artifacts, such as atom mixing, preferential sputtering of some of
the specimen components, and implantation of sputtered ions.26,27 These artifacts can at times be reduced by an appropriate choice
of the nature, energy, and incidence angle of impacting ions, as well
as by combining ion bombardment with sample rotation. However, if
sample damages have to be reduced and films of nanometer thickness
have to be characterized, nondestructive methods are preferable. Among
the nondestructive methods, the three-layer model approach18,28 requires a minimum of input data
(the acquisition of XPS image at only one angle), but the information
on film composition is averaged over the film thickness, thus assuming
the presence of an in-depth homogeneous film.

The in-depth distribution
of the elements present in surface films
might be also obtained exploiting the method developed by Tougaard.29 This method requires the acquisition of reference
spectra recorded on pure reference compounds, but it is limited to
a maximum of three reference spectra that can be used to simulate
the sample spectrum.28 The small numbers
of structures that can be verified and of the structural parameters
obtainable (six) represent the limit of this method when it is applied
to more complex systems.30

Angle-resolved
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) is considered
a very convenient method for determining in-depth composition profiles
of thin films,31 as it is nondestructive,
a particular advantage if chemical-state information is important.32 However, obtaining the concentration versus
depth information from the intensity versus angle XPS data requires
the inversion of a Laplace transform31 that
leads to more than one solution32 (ill-posed
problem). Furthermore, the noise of ARXPS data strongly affects the
results.31,32 The reconstruction is based on the assumption
of model profiles but, due to the presence of noise, many models matching
experimental data might exist.32,33 For this reason, it
is not possible to reconstruct the profiles by simply minimizing the
weighted sum-of-square differences between calculated and measured
data, especially if the surface layer is complex and consists of many
components. However, the reconstruction of the depth profiles from
ARXPS data is achievable by the maximum entropy method (MEM).26,33−38

The importance of MEM reconstruction starting by ARXPS data,
for
example, in semiconductors field, was highlighted in the last years
by Yonamoto39 who applied MEM data processing
not only to ARXPS data, but also to thermally stimulated current,
isochronal annealing (IA), and thickness-dependent CV (cyclic voltammetry)
data, proving that MEM allows an easy extraction of important information
for understanding the physics of devices.

The impact of the
noise in angle-resolved data31,32 can be controlled by
implementing a suitable algorithm.40 The
first MEM algorithm was developed by the
research group and applied to the nondestructive in-depth composition
profile of oxy-hydroxide layers on iron surfaces.38 Then, an MEM algorithm was developed and combined with
the previous version in a unique iterative protocol.40 A large number of numerical experiments were carried out
showing that the iterative protocol is suitable for reconstruction
of many different depth profile topologies with up to eight components.40 In this work, it has been applied to a real
case, the characterization of the P-enriched surface films grown on
a Ni18P alloy. The results of the in-depth composition profile enabled
the proposal of a new model for the mechanism of surface film formation
and the rationalization of the high corrosion and wear resistance
of the NiP alloys.

The main advantage of MEM reconstruction
starting from ARXPS data
is that it is possible to obtain the composition versus depth distribution
of all species optimizing the IMFP of the emitted electrons; in our
knowledge, there are no other examples that are based on the optimization
of the IMFP.

Results
Electrochemical Results
The electrochemical behavior
of the NiP alloy in near-neutral solutions was previously studied,10 and the results are here briefly summarized.
The high corrosion resistance of NiP alloys is confirmed by anodic
polarization curves and by the corrosion current densities ranging
between 0.5 and 0.7 μA/cm2; the inhibition of oxygen
reduction is inferred by dynamic cathodic polarization curves in deaerated
solutions. The potentiostatic polarization curves at 0.1 V saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) in deaerated 0.1 M sodium sulfate solution
showed that the current density decreased upon time according to a
square root law. This finding suggests a diffusion-controlled reaction.
Full results are provided in ref (10). In the present study, further investigations
have been carried out for detailing the in-depth composition profiles
of the Ni18P alloy exposed to solutions using ARXPS and applying an
MEM protocol presented in ref (40). This allows focusing on the structural chemistry at the
surface film–bulk alloy interface.

ARXPS Results
Figures 1–4 show the examples
of the high-resolution spectra of Ni 2p3/2, P 2p, O 1s,
and C 1s acquired in angle-resolved mode on a Ni-P sample polarized
at +0.1 V SCE in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution for
1 h. The changes in signal intensities and shape as a function of
the emission angle are plotted for 10 emission angles together with
an example of fitted spectrum. The curve fitting of the Ni 2p3/2 signal (Figure 1a) was performed using two components.8,18,25 The most intense peak, found at 853.1 eV
with its satellite at 860.4 eV, was assigned, in agreement with the
literature18 and on the basis of the results
published in a previous work of the authors,8,25 to
nickel in the bulk alloy, whereas the second peak at 857.0 eV and
its satellite at 863.2 eV were attributed to Ni2+ in nickel
phosphate or polyphosphates.8,18,25,41,42 The same parameters were adopted for fitting the high-resolution
spectra acquired in the standard mode (Figure S2) for validating the procedure. The relative intensity of
the two signals versus the emission angle (Figure 1b) shows some scatter due to the fact that
the spectra were acquired using the ARXPS acquisition lens mode. However,
a trend to a smaller value of the component “nickel bulk”
and an increase of the component “nickel phosphate”
can be observed at higher emission angle.

in ARXPS acquisition mode from Ni18P specimen polarized at +0.1 V
SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 for 1 h (with curve fitting)
and (b) relative intensity vs emission angle calculated from the ARXPS
data.

Similar trends were also confirmed
by the spectra acquired following
the mechanical polishing protocol and after 3 and 14 h of potentiostatic
polarization in sulfate solution.

P 2p Region
The
angle-resolved high-resolution spectra
of the P 2p signal (Figure 2a) were processed using three components, i.e., three doublets
with the P 2p3/2 at 129.5 (0.1) eV, 132.0 (0.1) eV, and
133.7 (0.1) eV (Figure 2a bottom) in agreement with literature results.18,20,25 Each doublet assigned to P 2p3/2 and P 2p1/2 was fitted constraining the area ratio to
2:127 and constraining the binding energy
difference to 0.81 eV. On the basis of the literature,18,20 other works of the authors,27 and high-resolution
spectra acquired in the standard mode (Figure S3), the doublet at 129.5 eV was assigned to phosphorus in
the bulk alloy. The doublet at 133.7 (0.1) eV, assigned to P in phosphate,
was shifted to about 0.3–0.4 eV toward high binding energy
values compared to the value measured on mechanically polished NiP
sample (133.3 eV). A similar binding energy shift was detected between
the reference pyrophosphate (133.6 (0.1) eV) and the orthophosphate
(133.3 eV).8

Figure 2 (a) P 2p high-resolution
spectra acquired with ThetaProbe in the
ARXPS acquisition mode from Ni18P specimen polarized at +0.1 V SCE
in 0.1 M Na2SO4 for 1 h (with curve fitting)
and (b) relative intensity vs emission angle calculated from the ARXPS
data.

As far as the intermediate BE
component is concerned, its chemical state has been
under discussion since a long time. The presence of P(I) and P(III)
in unidentified compounds and the possible formation of hypophosphite
were assumed19,20 at the interface between the
surface film and the bulk alloy. These assignments were based only
on the chemical shift of the photoelectron spectrum. In this work,
the modified Auger parameter α calculated as α = BE(2p)
+ KE(KLL)43−45 and the Wagner plot are used to identify the chemical
state of phosphorus. This approach allowed the authors, on the basis
of the results presented in a previous paper,25 to assign the doublet at 132.0 eV to phosphorus with a chemical
environment very close to that of elemental phosphorus and to confirm
the attribution of the lower and higher BE component.

The relative
intensity
of the peak assigned to P in the bulk alloy (129.5 eV) decreases at
high emission angle (Figure 2b), whereas the relative intensities of the other two phosphorus
components at 132.0 and 133.7 eV were found to increase (Figure 2b).

The same
tendency was exhibited by the spectra obtained on polarized
samples for 3 and 14 h as well as after the mechanically polished
sample.

O 1s Region
Figure 3a presents the angle-resolved high-resolution spectra
of O 1s together with the example of a fitted spectrum. Two components
were detected at binding energies of 531.5 and 532.9 eV. The former
was attributed to nonbridging oxygen and the latter to bridging oxygen
in polyphosphates. At this BE value, there might also be a small contribution
from adsorbed water. The presence of a contribution of organic contamination
at 531.5 eV due to the contact with the laboratory atmosphere cannot
be ruled out even if, after both mechanical polishing and electrochemical
tests, the samples were transferred in the vacuum chamber in less
than 3 min.

Figure 3 (a) O 1s high-resolution spectra acquired with ThetaProbe in the
ARXPS acquisition mode on a Ni18P specimen polarized at +0.1 V SCE
in 0.1 M Na2SO4 for 1 h (with curve fitting)
and (b) relative intensities vs emission angle calculated from the
ARXPS data.

The O 1s spectra obtained
on NiP alloys following mechanically
polishing (Figure S4) only two components
at 531.5 (0.1) eV and 533.4 (0.1) eV were revealed.8 The spectra acquired after 1 and 3 h of potentiostatic
polarization did not exhibit differences in the relative intensity
(Figure S5); on the contrary, polarization
for 14 h resulted in an increase of the most intense peak at about
531 eV, whereas the peak at 532.9 eV decreased.8

In the MEM calculations, only the total O 1s intensity
was considered
to not influence depth profile reconstruction on the basis of O 1s
curve fitting and assignments. This is justified by the relative intensities
of the two components that do not vary, within experimental error,
with emission angle (Figure 3b), and by the fact that the MEM protocol40 has proved to be able to properly work on an element present
in two adjacent layers with different concentrations.40

C 1s Region
C 1s spectra (Figure 4) are found to be the convolution of two signals: one at 284.8
(0.1) eV and the other at 286.6 (0.1) eV. Their binding energy values
as well as the relative intensities did not vary with the polarization
potential and time. The peak at 284.8 eV originates from aliphatic
carbon of the adventitious contamination. The peak at 286.6 eV might
be assigned to a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom. Figure S6 shows the high-resolution spectra obtained
in the standard lens mode.

Figure 4 C 1s high-resolution spectra acquired with ThetaProbe
in ARXPS
acquisition mode from Ni18P specimen polarized at +0.1 V SCE in 0.1
M Na2SO4 for 1 h.

The relative intensities of the two components remained constant
with the emission angle, and similarly to what was done for the oxygen,
it was decided to use the intensity of the whole spectral region in
MEM protocol application.

Application of the MEM
Protocol to Real NiP Samples
The MEM protocol was presented
in detail in a previous paper,40 where
it was emphasized that its novelty is
related to the possibility of calculating the thicknesses of the layers
and their composition versus depth optimizing the IMFP of the emitted
electrons. It was applied to mechanically polished Ni18P alloys and
the same alloys polished and polarized for 1, 3, and 14 h at +0.1
V SCE in neutral sulfate solution. Here, the specific case of the
Ni18P alloy, polarized for 1 h, is taken as an example. The details
of the data processing are provided in the Experimental/Data
Processing section. Figure 5a shows the experimental apparent concentration diagram
(ACD) calculated for emission angles from 25 to 57° on the basis
of the ARXPS data (Figures 1–4).

data (symbols) and starting hypothesis (dotted lines), (b) relative

data (symbols) and refined better layered structure (dotted lines).

Literature on NiP alloys with
phosphorus content higher than 16
atom % agrees on the statement that the observed high corrosion resistance
can be attributed to a “phosphorus-enriched surface film”
that strongly limits alloy dissolution and not to an oxide-type passivation.10,25 Despite different assignments of the phosphorus species in the literature,25 a layered structure of a phosphorus species
(hypophosphite,20 orthophosphate,18 phosphide,21 or phosphate25) on top of a P-enriched interface can be proposed
here as the starting model. Evidences derived from Auger electron
spectroscopy depth profiling19 and glow
discharge optical microscopy46 also support
the presence of this P-enriched interface.

The relative depth
plot RDP (Figure 5b)
shows the highest values for carbon and oxygen:
this suggests that a contamination layer is present at the outermost
surface. Looking at different phosphorus compounds, the sequence P-phosphate,
P-elemental, and P-bulk can be clearly observed. The same can be revealed
for nickel, where Ni-phosphate is external with respect to the Ni-bulk.

Application of Tougaard’s method to the same Ni-P samples8,25 resulted in an outer phosphate layer having a thickness of 1 nm
and a 1 nm thick intermediate P-enriched layer present at the interface
with the bulk alloy. The content of phosphorus at the interface resulted
to be about 55 atom %.

The starting hypothesis for the depth
profile was a layered structure
with an outermost contamination layer (thickness, 1 nm), a stoichiometric
nickel phosphate layer of 1 nm thickness, and a 1 nm thick P-enriched
interface on a bulk alloy with nominal composition (Table 1). On the basis of this initial
assumption, the ACD plot was calculated and is shown by the dotted
lines in Figure 5a.
It appears obvious that this hypothesis was not conforming to the
actual depth profile (root-mean-square difference (RMSD) was 9.1 atom
%). For instance, the thickness of the P-enriched interface appeared
to be too large because all calculated apparent concentrations for
P-elemental were higher than the experimental values. The bulk Ni
and P concentrations appeared too small at all of the emission angles.
Thus, the starting hypothesis had to be modified. As the ACD data
are normalized to 100% at each of the emission angles, during this
refinement, every modification would affect all of the other concentrations.
An iterative procedure (simulator routine40) was applied to find the best concentration–depth profile,
as described in Experimental/Data Processing section.

a The different phases of the MEM
protocol: starting hypothesis, best layered structure after refinement
in the simulator routine, and after application of the MEM algorithm.

The best layered structure
was found to be a contamination layer
of 0.8 nm thickness, a nickel phosphate layer of 1 nm thickness, and
a phosphorus-enriched interface of 1 nm thickness on the bulk alloy
(Table 1). The ACD
of this refined structure is shown in Figure 5c together with the experimental data. Compared
to Figure 5a, a clearer
improvement can be observed (RMSD decreased to 1.6 atom %).

As input for the application of the MEM algorithm to the experimental
ACD data (Figure 5a,c),
only the layer thicknesses of the best layered depth profile (Table 1) were used, whereas
the chemical composition of individual layers was not taken into account,
that is, each layer started with equal amount of all of the species
present. The only constrain was the known bulk composition of the
alloy (Ni18P). MEM reconstructed depth profile of the same alloy polarized
for 1 h at +0.1 V SCE is shown in Figure 6a, confirming the layered structure with
the sequence: contamination layer (1.0 nm), nickel phosphate layer
(1.2 nm) on top of the strongly phosphorus-enriched interface (2.0
nm), and the bulk. Compositions of the different layers are provided
in Table 1. The correspondent
apparent concentration diagram (Figure 6b) is in fairly good agreement with apparent concentration
versus emission angle ARXPS data, and the RMSD has the lowest value
of 1.2 atom %.

and recalculated MEM data (dashed lines).

The anomalous “peak” present in the P-bulk
curve
at the phosphate/bulk interface (Figure 6a) is not “real” but a systematic
artifact of the MEM algorithm: this particular feature appeared every
time when the algorithm tried to reproduce an interface enriched in
the lower-concentration component of the bulk, even in the numerical
experiments.8,40

Nevertheless, thickness
and composition of the enriched layer were
always reproduced within the expected accuracy8,40 as
the relative concentration of a certain species in a given layer is
obtained from the area (and not from the height) of the corresponding
curve in the depth profile.

Mechanically Polished Samples
Table 2 shows quantitative results of the MEM reconstructed
depth profile for mechanically polished samples. The sequence contamination
layer (1.0 nm), nickel phosphate layer (0.9 nm), and phosphorus-enriched
interface (1.0 nm) was found. Nickel phosphate layer on the mechanically
polished samples shows with good accuracy the stoichiometric composition
of Ni3(PO4)2 standard (23 atom %
Ni, 15 atom % P, 62 atom % O) formed as reaction product during mechanical
polishing. The thickness of P-enriched interface was found to be about
1 nm, with composition of 40 atom % phosphorus.

Polarized Samples
The quantitative results of MEM reconstructed
depth profile following the potentiostatic polarization for 1, 3,
and 14 h are reported in Table 2. The thicknesses of all of the three layers (contamination,
phosphate and P-enriched layer) do not significantly vary with polarization
time. The composition of the nickel phosphate layer is enriched with
phosphorus and depleted in nickel compared to the expected stoichiometry
of Ni3(PO4)2. For P-enriched interface,
a thickness of ca. 2 nm and a composition of nearly 50 atom % of P
was found; thus, exposure to an electrolyte and electrochemical polarization
leads to a strong alloy dissolution and associated P enrichment at
the interface.

Additionally, the MEM reconstruction revealed
that phosphorus at the P-enriched interface between the surface layer
and the bulk alloy of all samples is not present in a unique chemical
state, but present in the bulk alloy with chemical bonds to nickel
and at the interface as elemental phosphorus, meaning that phosphorus
appears here to be mainly surrounded by other phosphorus atoms.

Discussion
The present work reports for the first time
full quantitative information
on the composition of the layers in function of depth of NiP alloys.
These findings constitute the base for providing a rational model
of the mechanism of formation and of the nature of the P-enriched
surface layer and might also contribute to shed a light on the high
corrosion resistance of this peculiar alloy system.

Uncertainties on Concentration
and Depth Resolution
According to Cumpson,31 ARXPS inversion
is sensitive primarily to the precision rather than accuracy of peak
intensity measurement. This means that the accuracy of the final depth
profile will depend on the accuracy of elemental sensitivity factors,
primary beam variability, and others, no more than in ordinary “single
emission angle” XPS systematic uncertainties.

On the
other hand, signal-to-noise ratio was found to intrinsically affect
the relative depth resolution (Δz/z) of an MEM reconstructed depth profile.31 Experimental ARXPS data presented in this study have an S/N ratio
belonging to the range indicated by Cumpson31 as that achievable in “careful peak intensity measurements,”
i.e., region of practical significance for depth profiling.

The maximum expected uncertainty was found to be 20 and 30% for
thickness and concentration, respectively, for tests performed on
self-assembled monolayer on gold with known composition depth profile
(unpublished data). This result was also confirmed by large series
of numerical experiments, where a random error was introduced in the
data to take into account the influence of experimental error on MEM
protocol accuracy.40

Finally, another
possible source of uncertainty, especially on
overlayer thickness determination, is the roughness of sample surface.
In this work, this effect was neglected following investigations by
Gunter et al.47 and Oswald.48

According to Gunter and co-workers,47 an error lower than 10% affects the estimation
of thickness of overlayers
grown on rough substrates when the roughness is not taken into consideration.
Oswald48 evaluated the effect of surface
roughness by computer simulations, taking into account the presence
of islands on smooth overlayers. He concluded that, if the structure
size was smaller than the attenuation length of the photoelectrons,
the amount of the overlayer material or its thickness could be calculated,
with a systematic underestimation of the quantification in the range
up to 5%.

Concentration–Depth Profile of Ni18P Samples
The ACD diagram corresponding to the starting hypothesis of the depth
profile (Figure 5a)
showed an RMSD from experimental data of 9.1 atom %. After the application
of the simulator routine (Figure 5c), the RMSD of the calculated ACD data decreased to
1.6 atom %, indicating the efficiency of the routine itself to produce
a refined depth profile. When concentrations were removed from the
latter, i.e., the composition of all of the four layers was assumed
to be homogeneous and only layers thicknesses were used to build up
the initial profile, an increase of the RMSD up to 5.4 atom % was
observed. This is solely due to a deviation from real layers composition
because their thickness did not change. On the other hand, being this
last RMSD value only 60% of that corresponding to the starting hypothesis,
this result suggests that layer thicknesses were varied properly and
thus we obtained really improved starting conditions. Finally, after
MEM reconstruction, both layer thickness and composition were further
refined up to an RMSD equal to 1.2 atom %, i.e., lower than that corresponding
to the simulator profile.

Results of the concentration–depth
profile obtained from ARXPS data using the MEM protocol40 (Figures 1–4) show that after anodic polarization
at +0.1 V SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO4, as well as after
mechanical polishing, a nickel phosphate overlayer (thickness, ca.
1 nm) forms. A new result is that MEM depth profile reconstruction
also enabled to calculate the stoichiometry of this phosphate layer
(Table 2), thus providing
important new insight into the surface film on NiP alloys (see section
below).

The MEM composition depth profile (Figure 6a) also reveals the formation
of a P-enriched
layer at the interface between the phosphate layer and the bulk alloy,
as schematically displayed in Figure 7. The presence of the P-enriched layer was reported
or suggested by several other groups,11−22 mostly without specifying its thickness and composition. The MEM
protocol applied in this work has allowed quantifying both its thickness
and composition. The thickness of this P-enriched interface was estimated
to be about 2 nm for polarized samples and about 1 nm for the mechanically
polished ones (Table 2). Composition depth profile obtained from MEM reconstruction (Figure 6a) made it possible
to distinguish the chemical state of phosphorus8,23,25 in the P-enriched interface as phosphorus
in the bulk NiP alloy (with chemical bonds to nickel) and phosphorus
in the elemental chemical state (chemical bonds only to other P atoms).
For a total concentration of 46 atom % at the P-enriched interface,
about 34 atom % might be considered as P surrounded by Ni atoms and
the rest, about 12 atom %, could be assigned to elemental P (Table 2).

Finally,
the concentration–depth profile from MEM reconstruction
allowed taking into account also the adventitious contamination layer.
The contamination layer was calculated to be 1 nm thick and its composition
resulted to be 80 atom % C and 20 atom % O.

The composition
as a function of depth was revealed to remain unchanged
with the potentiostatic polarization time, within the accuracy of
the MEM protocol.40

Chemical Nature of the
Phosphate Layer
The thin phosphate
layer detected on the surface of the alloy by the ARXPS data (nickel
Ni 2p, Figure 1a; phosphorus
P 2p, Figure 2a) was
revealed on both mechanically polished and polarized Ni18P sample
surfaces. The concentration–depth profile reconstructed with
the MEM protocol40 shows this layer to
have a thickness of ca. 1 nm (Table 2), in good agreement with results from Tougaard’s
method, which yielded 0.9 (0.1) nm.8,25 In addition
to thickness, the composition of the phosphate layer was calculated
using the MEM algorithm (Table 2). On mechanically polished samples, an inorganic nickel phosphate
layer with practically nominal composition of Ni3(PO4)2 was found (stoichiometric composition: Ni, 23
atom %; P, 15 atom %; O 62 atom %). On the other hand, the Ni/P/O
concentration ratio of 1:2:5 for the polarized Ni18P samples suggests
a composition close to nickel polyphosphate (Table 2).

This result was also suggested by
XPS images of O 1s region (Figure 3a), where the presence of “nonbridging”
(BE = 531.1 eV) and “bridging” oxygen (BE = 532.2 eV)
could be distinguished, as the chain structure of polyphosphates43 presumes. However, because total O 1s intensity
was used in the MEM protocol, the nonbridging/bridging oxygen ratio
was not resolved in the reconstructed depth profile. However, the
curve fitting of O 1s ARXPS images acquired on the polarized samples
was also performed using a model function to take into account the
contribution due to adsorbed water and constraining the position of
all of the other components; in this way, it was possible to determine
a nonbridging/bridging oxygen intensity ratio equal to about 1.8.
This value was found in long-chain phosphate.42 On the contrary, O 1s spectra recorded on the mechanically polished
sample8 (not shown) did not present any
bridging oxygen contribution and the nonbridging O to P concentration
ratio of 5.0 could be considered compatible with the reference Ni3(PO4)2 compound within the MEM accuracy.8,40

This difference between mechanically polished and polarized
phosphate
layer is further confirmed by the P 2p chemical shift. The ΔBE
between the phosphate component recorded on polarized and nonpolarized
samples was found to be the same as that observed between the reference
nickel pyrophosphate and orthophosphate (see above).

Summarizing,
on mechanically polished samples, a thin layer of
nickel orthophosphate, about 1 nm thick, is present. On the polarized
samples, thus in the region of current arrest and high corrosion resistance,
the presence of the previously suggested17,18 nickel orthophosphate could be ruled out. On these samples, a long-chain
polyphosphate layer is present. These long-chain polyphosphates, indeed,
show very low solubility in water and exhibit excellent tribological
properties.49,50

Influence of Polarization
Time
The parameters investigated
in this work for elucidating the effect of time were the binding energy
values, the intensity ratio of the various phosphorus P 2p species,
the thickness of both the polyphosphate layer and the P-enriched interface,
and the composition of the polyphosphate layer. The first two were
found to be independent of the polarization time within the accuracy
of MEM (Table 2), whereas
small changes upon longer polarization have been revealed in the composition
of the polyphosphate film (Table 2).

A further indication of changes in the polyphosphate
layer is found in the O 1s spectra collected at near-normal emission
angles. The nonbridging/bridging oxygen ratio was found to increase
from 1.8 after 1 h of polarization to about 3.0 following 14 h of
polarization at +0.1 V SCE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution.
This change is mainly due to an increase in the intensity of the nonbridging
oxygen component. The nonbridging oxygen to P-phosphate intensity
ratio at 14 h of polarization is higher (+40%) than that after 1 or
3 h. These results may be ascribed to changes in the polyphosphate
chain length.41

An increased phosphorus
concentration resulting from the initial
preferential dissolution of nickel might contribute, at longer times,
to a more diffusion-limited dissolution of nickel through the P-enriched
interface, as observed with electrochemical experiments during potentiostatic
polarization or corrosion at the open-circuit potential in 0.1 M NaCl.10 The proof for this hypothesis is lacking, as
surface analytical data of samples immersed for long times at the
free corrosion potential are not (yet) available.

The experiments
performed at +0.1 V SCE, thus at the higher end
of the current arrest in polarization curves,10,25 showed a slow current increase after 1–3 h of polarization10,25 associated with the appearance of localized black spots after 14
h in both chloride and sulfate solutions.10 The same features were observed after anodic potentiodynamic scans
to 0.6 V SCE and have also been reported in earlier works.15,21,51 These features cannot be considered
as “normal” pitting corrosion because the black spots
were found to occur also in sulfate solutions when chloride ions were
absent.10 The black spots seem to be randomly
distributed and not related to the morphological structure of the
underlying alloy. One possible explanation for these features might
be the local breakdown of the polyphosphate film as indicated by the
changing nonbridging/bridging oxygen ratio and by the O-nonbridging
to P-phosphate ratio at longer polarization times. This local breakdown
does not seem to occur at lower potentials25 (e.g., −0.1 V SCE).

Model of Formation and Dissolution of Protective
Surface Film
on Ni-P Alloys
The proposed mechanism of reaction of the
NiP alloy when immersed in a sulfate solution at pH 6.3 is the following:
both nickel and phosphorus tend to dissolve in the electrolyte solution50 as Ni2+ and H2PO3–. Due to the fact that nickel dissolves faster
than phosphorus,10,20,22 a progressive enrichment of P results at the alloy surface. The
dissolution of nickel in this early stage (<1 h at +0.1 V SCE)
can be, based on electrochemical results, described as a diffusion-limited
process.10,25 The nickel dissolution causes the thickening
of the P-enriched layer and also compositional changes. As a result,
phosphorus is present in two different chemical states, one corresponding
to phosphorus still bonded to Ni atoms and the other resulting in
P atoms surrounded by other phosphorus atoms that it might be described
as elemental P. According to this model substantiated by the surface
analytical results, the hypothesis of formation of an orthophosphate,
hypophosphite, or phosphide layer can be ruled out in agreement with
the previous findings.25

Dihydrogenated
phosphite anions eventually formed might be further oxidized52 and form dihydrogenated phosphate anions (H2PO4–) that might react to form
polyphosphate chains that are characterized by low water solubility.
The thin polyphosphate layer formed on top of the P-enriched layer
might also act as a barrier between the alloy surface and the electrolyte
solution so that the corrosion reaction is slowed down.

The
appearance of the “black spots” that become visible
upon prolonged polarization time might be interpreted in terms of
breakdown of the polyphosphate layer. The surface film seems to be
in dynamic transformation: the long-chain phosphates might be converted
into soluble dihydrogenated orthophosphate and thus readily dissolved.
Thus, several “channels” might be generated on the surface
film resulting in a local destruction of the protective layer. The
oxygen might then diffuse through them to reach the surface underneath,
causing the dissolution of nickel into the solution. The formation
of these channels is in agreement with the findings of other authors
who explained in this way the breakdown of the protective surface
film of NiP alloys.15 The evidence provided
by the MEM composition versus depth profile is that the average composition
and thickness of the surface layer remains unchanged upon time, supporting
that any further dissolution of the alloy is counterbalanced by a
self-healing process that results in the repair of the surface films.

Conclusions
The results of the maximum entropy method (MEM)
approach applied
to ARXPS data obtained on Ni18P alloys after mechanical polishing
and anodic polarization in sulfate solution indicate the presence
of a complex layered structure. Four layers were identified by this
approach with different thicknesses and compositions: an outermost
contamination layer made of organic carbon and oxygen; a second thin
layer (about 1 nm thick) made of nickel (poly)phosphate, and a highly
phosphorus-enriched interface zone of about 2 nm thick with a marked
concentration gradient. Finally, the bulk of the alloy is revealed
with the nominal composition. From this work, it can be concluded:

Quantitative in-depth composition profiles in the nanometer range
are provided by the MEM protocol taking into account for the first
time the variation of IMFP values of the photoelectrons within the
layers. The protocol works successfully, reducing the root-mean-square
difference (RSMD) between experimental data and model profile from
9.1% for the initial guess to 1.2% after MEM application.

The
MEM depth profile substantiates the diffusion-controlled dissolution
mechanism of the NiP alloys, providing evidence of the presence of
phosphorus not coordinated to nickel at the interface.

The long-chain
nickel polyphosphate layer detected at the surface
is acknowledged to have a low solubility in water. This layer might
act as a barrier at the surface of the alloy and hinders the dissolution
of nickel ions. Its presence explains the excellent tribological properties
of NiP alloys, and the complex structure characterized by the polyphosphate
film on top of a layer containing P–P bonds provides an experiment-supported
explanation of the outstanding corrosion resistance of Ni18P alloys.

Further work is needed to ascertain if the proposed model rationalizing
the high corrosion resistance of the NiP alloys holds at open-circuit
(immersion) conditions.

Experimental/Data Processing
NiP Alloys
Preparation and Characterization
NiP coatings
were prepared by electroless deposition using a commercial nickel
hypophosphite bath operating at pH 4.8 and 88 °C (Galvanic, Wädenswil,
CH). The nickel plating bath was composed of nickel sulfate (NiSO4·6H2O) and sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2·2H2O) together with complexing agents
and stabilizers. The plating rate was 10–12 μm/h, and
the coating thickness was 15–20 μm. Further details on
the deposition process are given in refs (8, 10, 25). The coatings
had phosphorus content of 18.4–19.0 atom % and X-ray amorphous
structure. The results of morphological characterization are reported
elsewhere.25

Sample Preparation
Electrochemical measurements were
performed using an EG&G 273 potentiostat/galvanostat controlled
by M352 software and a traditional three-electrode cell; a saturated
calomel electrode was used as reference (SCE, potential +0.242 V vs
NHE). More information on the setup are given elsewhere.8,10,25

Potentiostatic polarizations
were performed for 1, 3, and 14 h at +0.1 V SCE in deaerated 0.1 M
Na2SO4 solution, on specimens kept at the open-circuit
potential (OCP) for 15 min. More details are given in refs10, 25.

Mechanically polished Ni18P samples
were analyzed by XPS, and the
same samples were also analyzed after electrochemical tests. Details
on mechanical polishing conditions are given in ref (25).

XPS Analysis and Data Processing
XPS characterization
of NiP alloys was carried out using a ThetaProbe spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., East Grinstead, U.K.). The analysis chamber
is under ultra-high-vacuum conditions, and the pressure during spectra
acquisition was always lower than 5 × 10–6 Pa.

A monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) was used at 4.7
mA and 15 kV (70 W) that resulted in a 300 μm spot size. Both
high-resolution and survey spectra were acquired in fixed analyzed
transmission mode, and the pass energy was set to 100 eV. Calibration
of the binding energy scale was accomplished using reference materials
SCAA90 of Cu, Ag, and Au following an in situ argon ion sputtering
necessary to remove the contamination and the thin oxide layer.53 The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the
Ag 3d5/2 line, under these experimental conditions, was
found to be 0.83 eV. ThetaProbe intensity/energy response function
(IERF) was determined following instructions reported in the spectrometer
user guide, using a polynomial fit to a log10(Ag 3d5/2 peak area/PE) versus log10(RR) plot, where RR
is the retard ratio defined as the ratio between the electron kinetic
energy and the pass energy (KE/PE).

The experiments were carried
out in standard mode at 53° emission
angle and in the so-called angle-resolved mode. This mode allows the
collection at 16 different emission angles, ranging from 24.88 to
81.13°. Spectra obtained at emission angles above 60° were
not used in this work because no correction of elastic scattering
was applied54,55 (see section IMFP Calculation). The ThetaProbe spectrometer allows the
parallel collection of angle-resolved data by means of a 2D detector.
Compared to serial ARXPS, which requires the tilting of the sample
and the acquisition of the spectra at each angle, the data acquisition
is faster; furthermore, the sample is not moved during the parallel
acquisition, thus ensuring that the position of the analyzed point
is not changing during the analysis. For insulating samples, also
the charge compensation conditions in parallel ARXPS experiments are
maintained constant.56

The sputtering
conditions were 3 kV and 1 μA. Neutralization
of the samples was carried out using the neutralizer supplied by Thermo
Fisher by flooding the sample with low-energy electrons and low-energy
ions.

CASA XPS software (Casa Software Ltd., U.K.) was exploited
for
data processing. The curve fitting model using Gaussian–Lorentzian
product functions followed Shirley–Sherwood background subtraction.8 Peak areas, which in the following
are indicated with the term intensities, were corrected for Scofield’s
photoionization cross section,57 angular
asymmetry function,58 and ThetaProbe intensity/energy
response function (IERF). The angular asymmetry function was calculated
using a routine that accounts for the various emission γ angles
in the angle-resolved acquisition mode. The corrected intensities
were normalized to 1 for each emission angle. These normalized intensities
were plotted versus emission angle to construct the apparent concentration
diagram (ACD).

The maximum entropy method (MEM) implemented
by the authors and
reported in detail in a previous paper40 was then applied for nondestructive depth profile reconstruction.

Starting Depth Profile
The MEM protocol proposed by
the authors requires an initial depth profile as input, which should
be typically based on (i) the apparent concentration diagrams (ACD),
(ii) relative depth plot (RDP), and (iii) results obtained with Tougaard’s
method.29

ACD Diagrams
The
experimental ACD is calculated as
described above and represents the basic input for a preliminary hypothesis
of the depth profile. A simulator routine has been implemented in
the MEM protocol40 to calculate the atomic
concentration diagram corresponding to the hypothesis of the depth
profile. The simulator is applied to look for the “best layered
depth profile” (i.e., a simple wafer model without any concentration
gradients between adjacent layers) whose calculated ACD best reproduced
the experimental one. This actually is an iterative procedure to minimize
the difference (root-mean-square difference, RMSD) between experimental
ACD and the calculated ACD for the theoretical depth profile. The
number of numerical layers (0.1 nm each) in the simulator routine
was taken as 10 times the maximum IMFP of the bulk alloy components,
considering the electrons to travel only through the alloy itself
(i.e., P 2p 1.9 nm, thus 190 layers). During simulator processing,
whenever the depth profile was modified, a new set of IMFP values
(one for each component) was calculated accordingly as described below.
At the end of the simulator routine, the number of numerical layers
was decreased to 150, with ACD data difference with respect to their
initial values <1%.

Relative Depth Plot
Due to the noise
in the experimental
data, the relative position of a chemical species in the depth profile
may be difficult to be obtained from ACD diagrams. The relative depth
plot (RDP), a histogram calculated as the ratio of the relative concentration
at near grazing to that at near-normal emission angle for each of
the species, can be helpful in achieving a rough initial estimate
of the depth profile: the lower the relative depth, the deeper the
species. Because differences in effective attenuation length of the
various species have a nonnegligible effect on the resulting relative
depths, RDP should be used only as qualitative support to other information
on the sample derived from the literature and/or other experimental
evidence. However, by keeping constant both the material being crossed
by photoelectrons and the emission angle, effective attenuation length
mainly depends on the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. Thus,
while relative depth of different elements may lead to misinterpretation,
RDP data obtained for different components of the same XPS signal
provide a correct indication of relative depth of the different chemical
species of the same element.

Tougaard’s Method
This method29 is totally independent
of MEM application because it starts
from standard-mode survey spectra instead of involving high-resolution
angle-resolved data. In this work, it was found to be a very useful
tool to perform a first depth profile reconstruction of NiP alloys.8,25

Finally, taking into account literature information about
polarized NiP alloys, RDP data, and results from Tougaard’s
method,8,25 the “best layered structure”
was obtained with the simulator routine by comparison with experimental
ACD data, and IMFP values were determined accordingly.40 This profile was then used as starting input
for the MEM algorithm, taking only the thickness but discarding the
composition of the layers.40

IMFP Calculation
The G1 equation59 implemented in the
NIST “Standard Reference Database
71” software60 was used to calculate
the electron mean free paths (IMFP). In Figure S1, the IMFP values versus kinetic energy are plotted, taking
into account four different situations:(1) the electron is traveling through
an homogeneous adventitious organic
layer (density = 1 g/cm3) composed of O (α atom %)
and C (β atom %);

(2) the electron is traveling in Ni3(PO4)2 (experimentally measured density,
1.6 g/cm3);

(3) the electron is traveling in pure
red P;59

(4) the electron is traveling in the Ni18P
alloy (density, 7.75 g cm–3).



For all of the chemical species detected, four IMFP
values were calculated because photoelectrons traveled through each
of the materials listed above; the calculated IMFPs were used as starting
values for the simulator routine,40 which
provides the actual IMFP as the average of the IMFPs in all of the
four mentioned materials, using thickness and composition of each
layer in the profile as weighting factors.

As mentioned, spectra
acquired at emission angles larger than 60°
were not used in the MEM reconstruction because increasing effect
of elastic scattering causes deviation from the Beer–Lambert
law that is at the basis of MEM formalism.40

Actually, the effective attenuation length (EAL) should be
used.
It is usually 10–40% smaller than IMFP due, again, to elastic
scattering events. Unfortunately, the derived EALs generally have
large uncertainties because of inadequate knowledge of film morphology
and thickness.61 As a result, EAL values
deduced from universal curves or experimental studies should be regarded
only as rough guides.61 Moreover, it was
shown that calculations for quantitative analysis require knowledge
of IMFP rather than EAL and that the use of the latter may result
in considerable errors.62
