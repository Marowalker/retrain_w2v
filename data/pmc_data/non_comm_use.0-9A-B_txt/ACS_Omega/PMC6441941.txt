The
interconnected porous structures that mimic the extracellular
matrix support cell growth in tissue engineering. Nanofibers generated
by electrospinning can act as a vehicle for therapeutic cell delivery
to a neural lesion. The incorporation of carbon nanomaterials with
excellent electrical conductivity in nanofibers is an attractive aspect
for design of a nanodevice for neural tissue regeneration. In this
study, nanoscaffolds were created by electrospinning poly(ε-caprolactone)
(PCL) and three different types of carbon nanomaterials, which are
carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerene. The component of carbon
nanomaterials in nanofibers was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy. The fiber diameter was determined by scanning electron
microscopy, and it was found that the diameter varied depending on
the type of nanomaterial in the fibers. The incorporation of carbon
nanotubes and graphene in the PCL fibers increased the contact angle
significantly, while the incorporation of fullerene reduced the contact
angle significantly. Incorporation of CNT, fullerene, and graphene
in the PCL fibers increased dielectric constant. Astrocytes isolated
from neonatal rats were cultured on PCL-nanomaterial nanofibers. The
cell viability assay showed that the PCL-nanomaterial nanofibers were
not toxic to the cultured astrocytes. The immunolabeling showed the
growth and morphology of astrocytes on nanofiber scaffolds. SEM was
performed to determine the cell attachment and interaction with the
nanoscaffolds. This study indicates that PCL nanofibers containing
nanomaterials are biocompatible and could be used for cell and drug
delivery into the nervous system.

1 Introduction
Traumatic brain injury
and spinal cord injury are two of the leading
causes of lifelong physical and mental disability.1−3 Because of the
central nervous system’s (CNS) complexity, very little spontaneous
regeneration, repair, or healing occurs. Considerable work has been
undertaken to activate the endogenous repair system in order to restore
a wounded nervous system. However, limited success has been achieved.
The exogenous repair technology involving cell and bioscaffold transplantation
provides an alternate promising therapeutic approach.4 The hierarchical fibrous structures realigning at the nanometer
scale imitate the extracellular matrix. The microporous, nonwoven
poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoscaffolds generated by electrostatic
fiber spinning are biocompatible and biodegradable.5 The interconnected porous structures of the PCL nanofibers
can support cell adhesion and are suitable for the purpose of tissue
engineering.6

Previous studies have
shown that that electrospun nanofibers support
neurite outgrowth and glial cell migration.7−9 Astrocytes are
star-shaped glial cells that are contained in the brain environment
by building up the microarchitecture and maintaining the blood–brain
barrier. Astrocytes maintain brain homeostasis, control neural cell
metabolism and synaptic activity, and assist in glial signaling.10−13 In case of injury or disease, the death or survival of astrocytes
affects the ultimate clinical outcome and rehabilitation through neuron
genesis and reorganization.14 Successful
cell culturing on fabricated artificial polymeric scaffolds is important
for the purpose of tissue engineering.

Due to their morphological
and chemical versatility, carbon-based
nanomaterials have been investigated for their potential application
in neural tissue engineering. When neurons derived from developing
embryonic rat brain were cultured on multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWCNTs) coated with a bioactive molecule, the cells produced multiple
neurites with extensive branching.15 Graphene
is composed of two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon sheets,
which have two exposed surfaces and thus provide more surface area
than CNTs and fullerene. The electrical conductive property of carbon
nanomaterials in nanofibers also provides opportunity of in vivo application
of electrical stimulation for neural tissue regeneration.16 Electrospun carbon nanotube and poly(l-lactic acid) composite nanofibrous scaffolds can support growth
of olfactory ensheathing glial cells.17 It was reported that electrospun graphene-silk fibroin composite
scaffolds supported the survival and growth of the cultured Schwann
cells.18 Although these studies have reported
the interaction of neural cell and carbon-nanomaterial-loaded nanofibers,
studies are lacking to characterize the nanofibers containing three
different nanomaterials and study the astrocyte growth on those scaffolds.

In this study, nanofibers were fabricated by electrospinning the
hybrid materials of PCL and nanomaterial including carbon nanotube,
graphene, and fullerene. The physical and chemical properties of the
PCL-nanomaterial hybrid nanofibers were characterized, and the astrocyte
growth on these nanofibers was investigated. The cell viability and
morphology of astrocytes on nanofibers were studied. This study indicates
the feasibility of applying those nanoscaffolds in neural tissue engineering.

2 Results
2.1 Contact Angle of Electrospun
Fibers
The goniometric tests showed that the PCL scaffold
exhibited a contact
angle of 111.1 ± 0.1° (Figure 1). When 0.2% graphene or CNTs were incorporated
into the PCL nanofibers, the contact angles of the PCL-graphene (144.9
± 0.6°) and PCL-CNT (132.0 ± 1°) nanofibers increased
significantly (p < 0.01), compared with that of
PCL fibers. However, the incorporation of fullerene into the PCL nanofibers
significantly reduced the contact angle (100.7 ± 0.1°, p < 0.01).

and contact angle evaluation on different films of dense PCL nanofibers,

2.2 Nanofiber Diameter Alteration with Incorporation
of Nanomaterials
Fiber diameters of the nanoscaffolds with
0.2% nanomaterials, shown in Figure 2A–D, vary from 80 to 200 nm. The fiber diameters
of PCL, PCL-graphene, PCL-CNT, and PCL-fullerene are 123.2 ±
78.5, 116.7 ± 46.9, 165.1 ± 69.9, and 186.6 ± 50.1
nm, respectively (Figure 2E). Diameters of the PCL-CNT fiber and PCL-fullerene fiber
are significantly higher than those of the PCL fiber and PCL-graphene
fiber (p < 0.05). However, the diameters of PCL
and PCL-graphene nanofibers are not significantly different.

The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results in Figure 3 show the elemental
composition of the four different nanofiber scaffolds. Carbon and
oxygen are the main elements found in various nanofibers. No compositional
difference between the fibers and the bead-like globules was found.
Gold was also detected because gold was used to coat the samples to
improve the SEM image quality.

2.3 Chemical
Characterization of Nanofibers
FTIR analysis provides a good
indication of the chemical composition
of materials, and this analysis was necessary to confirm the presence
of nanomaterials in the scaffolds. Prior to assessing the scaffolds,
FTIR analysis of pure base PCL was carried out. Figure 4 shows FTIR results of the nanoscaffolds. Figure 4A shows prominent
peaks at 2944, 2864, 2150, 2022, 1710, 1418, 1365, 1293, 1240, 1174,
1107, 1046, 961, and 732 cm–1. The peak at 2944
indicates the C–H stretch. The long peak at 1710 indicates
the carbonyl stretch. The peak at 1471 reveals C–H scissoring.
The peak at 1240 shows the C–O stretch. The peaks at 961 and
732 show the C–C stretch.

Figure 4 FTIR analysis of nanoscaffolds: (A) PCL
fibers, (B) PCL-graphene
fibers, (C) PCL-CNT fibers, and (D) PCL-fullerene fibers.

Figure 4B shows
the FTIR analysis of PCL-graphene scaffolds. A previous study reported
that pristine graphene shows up in the 2900 peak region.19 With the increase in percentage of graphene,
the peak at 2930 keeps increasing.19Figure 4B shows that the
length of the C–H stretch increases at peaks 2944 and 2864,
whereas the C–C stretch increases at peak 732.

Figure 4D suggests
an increase in the C–H stretch with the increase in fullerene
concentration at peaks 2944 and 2864. The C–C stretch at peak
732.42 also seems to increase. Small peaks at 525 and 572, which were
not present in the original PCL, also emerge.20Figure 4C,D shows
an extra peak at 2350, which is actually background CO2. The pristine MWCNTs show up at around peak 1560. As can be seen
in Figure 4C, peaks
that were initially not present in PCL show up in subsequent PCL-CNT
scaffolds, thus confirming the presence of CNTs.

2.4 Dielectric Characterization
The PCL
electrospun fibers showed a dielectric constant of 2.13 ± 0.17.
Incorporation of CNT, fullerene, and graphene in the PCL fibers increased
dielectric constant. The increase of the carbon nanomaterial amount
in the nanofibers increased dielectric constant. The dielectric constants
of the PCL-CNT (0.2%), PCL-fullerene (0.2%), and PCL-graphene (0.2%)
are 3.11 ± 0.16, 3.89 ± 0.17, and 6.54 ± 0.14, respectively.
The dielectric constant of PCL-graphene (0.2%) is significantly higher
than those of PCL, PCL-CNT (0.2%), and PCL-fullerene (0.2%) (Figure 5). Having higher
dielectric constants of electrospun nanocomposite fibers may be beneficial
for cell–nanofiber communications because the dielectric constant
values of these fibers are close to those of the axonal membrane and
myelin sheath of neurons.

2.5 High Viability of Astrocytes on Nanoscaffolds
The viability of astrocytes on the nanoscaffolds was studied by
monitoring cell metabolic activity using the alamarBlue assay (Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL).21−23 Cell viability was presented
as the ratio of the reduction of alamarBlue reagent in cells on nanofibers
to that of cells cultured on a cell culture dish. The ratios for PCL,
PCL-graphene, PCL-CNT, and PCL-fullerene nanofibers are 1.09 ±
0.1, 1.20 ± 0.1, 1.11 ± 0.1, and 0.94 ± 0.2, respectively
(Figure 6). The difference
between cell viability on different types of nanofibers is not statistically
significant. This study suggested that the PCL-nanomaterial nanofibers
did not show significant toxicity to astrocytes.

electrospun nanofibers.

2.6 Morphological Study of Astrocytes on Nanofibers
Both immunostaining and SEM imaging studies were performed to investigate
the morphology of astrocytes grown on nanofiber scaffolds. Immunocytochemistry
of GFAP labeling showed the multipolar morphologies of the astrocytes
on nanofibers. These morphologies did not show a significant difference
on nanofibers containing different nanomaterials (Figure 7). SEM studies were performed
to confirm the morphology of astrocytes on nanofibers observed by
means of a fluorescence microscope and demonstrated the interaction
of cell processes with nanofibers (Figure 8).

3 Discussion
Almost all biological structures including human tissues and organs
are characterized by well-organized hierarchical fibrous structures
at a nanometer scale. The basic architecture of neural tissue such
as the brain or spinal cord very closely resembles that of an electrospun
scaffold. It has been suggested that the dual-scale scaffold, wherein
the microporous structure facilitated cell infiltration and multicellular
organizations in the pores, and the nanofibrous structures promoted
cell differentiation and cell–matrix adhesion.24 The electrospinning process is capable of fabricating a
nearly ideal tissue-engineered scaffold that mimics the in vivo microtissue
structure. By carefully controlling the process parameters, it is
possible to control the fiber diameters within a certain range. The
high surface area and extracellular-like physical environment provided
by nanofibers compared to that of other non-fibrillar surfaces may
have led to an increase in cellular attachment and the observed cell
polarity.

Nanomedicine shows great potential for treating various
causes
of damage in the central nervous system. Nanofiber scaffolds have
the capacity to provide structural support for regenerating, guiding,
and supporting cell growth from migration or transplantation. Nanomaterials
can assist in cell regeneration and healing due to their unique chemical
components and nanostructure. This study aimed to generate nanomaterial
scaffolds that resemble the extracellular matrix by electrospinning
and to characterize the biocompatibility of these nanoscaffolds. In
this study, the artificial PCL scaffolds encapsulating three types
of nanomaterials—carbon nanotubes, graphene, and fullerene—were
successfully fabricated. In general, the diameters of the nanofibers
range from 80 to 200 nm, which is close to the actual architecture
within the CNS. We found that, under the same fabrication condition,
the diameters of PCL-CNT and PCL-fullerene composite nanofibers are
higher than those of PCL and PCL-graphene nanofibers.

In the
contact angle study, the shape of the liquid drop depends
on the surface tension of the liquid, gravity, and density difference
between the liquid (water), substrate (electrospun scaffold), and
surface free energies. It was shown that the contact angle of PCL
fiber varies from 70 to 120°. The process of electrospinning
has been shown to increase the hydrophobicity of fibers. The water-repellent
properties of PCL electrospun materials are due to their rough, rippled
surfaces, which trap air between the ripples. This trapped air prevents
liquid, such as water, from penetrating the ripples, forcing it to
remain perched on top as intact droplets.25−28 It was suggested that the hydrophobic
materials act as an excellent medium for drug delivery over an extended
period of time. The hydrophobicity lowers the degradation kinetics
and increases the time for hydrolysis, thereby increasing the time
for cell attachment before degradation.29,30 In this study,
we observed that the contact angle increased with the increase in
the incorporation of graphene and CNT in nanofibers. However, fullerene
significantly decreased the contact angle when it was encapsulated
in the nanofibers. FTIR analysis is widely used to study bond types
and to identify unknown substances. The test can also aid in understanding
the mechanism of chemical reactions by measuring unstable substances.
The results of this study clearly indicate the peak location of the
nanomaterials and an increase in the peak intensities with the increase
in nanomaterial concentration.19,31,32

The signal transmission between axons of different neurons
in the
nervous system is analogous to the wires that connect different points
in an electric circuit. However, its basic mechanism is quite different.
In an electrical circuit, the wire maintains both ends at a constant
electrical potential difference and the current is caused by the movement
of electrons. The intracellular domain and the extracellular space
of axon are separated by the plasma membrane, and therefore, the signal
conducts due to a transient potential difference that appears across
this membrane. The electrical signal transmission along the axonal
membrane depends on the cell membrane depolarization and repolarization.
The dielectric constant of the axonal fluid contributes to the high
conduction velocities of axon electrical signals.33 The dielectric constant of axon myelin and the nodal membrane
of Ranvier (axonal membrane) is about 7.34 In this study, we measured the dielectric constant of PCL fibers
containing carbon nanomaterials. We revealed that the CNT, fullerene,
and graphene in the PCL fibers can significantly increase dielectric
constant. The increase of the carbon nanomaterial amount in the nanofibers
increased dielectric constant. The dielectric constant value of PCL
nanofibers with 0.2% graphene is 6.5 ± 0.1, which is significantly
higher than those of PCL-CNT (0.2%) and PCL-fullerene (0.2%) nanofibers.
The higher dielectric constant of nanofibers may improve the nerve
cell–fiber interaction and therefore enhance neural tissue
regeneration process. The dielectric property of the nanofibers provides
a platform for the potential electrical stimulation for the regeneration
of injured neural tissue.

Astrocytes have been identified as
among the key cells that assist
neurons in a variety of essential complicated functions including
synaptic transmission and information processing. Bioanalysis was
performed to assess astrocyte viability on nanofibers using the alamarBlue
assay. The nanomaterial scaffolds in the PCL nanofibers did not increase
the toxicity to the astrocytes grown on the scaffolds. The cell viability
of astrocytes on different PCL-nanomaterial composite nanofibers was
not significantly different. The study indicates that the PCL nanofibers
loaded with carbon nanomaterials are biocompatible to the cells. The
nanofiber scaffolds provide a platform with the combination of nanofiber
and carbon nanoparticles in neural regeneration.

In this study,
experiments were performed to test the toxicity
of the nanofibers loaded with carbon nanoparticles. So, the cell viability
assay (alamarBlue) was performed, and the study showed that the scaffolds
were not toxic to the cells. It is well established that the glial
fibrillary acidic protein is the principal 8–9 nm intermediate
filament in mature astrocytes of the CNS. GFAP was established as
a standard marker for astrocytes.35,36 This protein
is important in modulating astrocyte motility and shape by providing
structural stability to the astrocytic processes. It has been reported
that GFAP expression by astrocytes exhibits both regional and local
variability that is dynamically regulated by a large number of inter-
and intracellular signaling molecules.10,37−39

The immunostaining of astrocytes using anti-GFAP antibody
showed
astrocyte morphology on the scaffolds. We observed the multiple processes
of the GFAP positive astrocytes grown on the nanoscaffolds. These
images clearly show the growth of viable astrocytes on different PCL-nanomaterial
composite nanofibers.40,41 SEM imaging confirmed astrocyte
attachment and growth on the nanoscaffolds. The study also showed
that the cell morphology was not significantly different on nanofibers
containing different carbon nanomaterials. However, the cell density
will affect cell contact and cell interaction. The cell surface receptors
and molecules that regulate cell interaction will be investigated.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Scaffold Fabrication by
Electrospinning
PCL (molecular weight 70000, Tm = 60
°C, Tg = −60 °C, Scientific
Polymer Products Inc., New York) nanofibers were generated by electrospinning
a PCL solution. The solvent of the PCL solution consisted of a combination
of acetonitrile and acetic acid in a 1:1 ratio (by volume). The solute
consisted of a combination of PCL as the main ingredient and different
types of nanomaterials, which were graphene (platelets, ≥98.48%,
X-Y dimensions ≤ 5 μm, Z dimension = 50–100 nm,
≤2.2 g/cc, Angstron Materials Inc.), CNTs (catalytic multiwalled,
5–15 μm, 140 nm diameter, 0.2 g/cc, MER Corporation),
and fullerene (≥99.5%, spherical = 0.7–1 nm, clump of
crystals = 3 nm, molecular weight 720.64 g/mol, 1.600 g/cc, SES Research).
The percentage of nanomaterial in the nanofibers was 0.2% (by weight).
The solvent-to-solute ratio was 85:15 (by weight), and the temperature
of the solution was 50 °C in order to maintain a fixed viscosity.
The nanomaterial-loaded PCL solution was prepared by magnetic stirring
for 12–16 h at 50 °C. In the process of electrospinning,
the nanofibers were collected on a stationary collector placed 25
cm from the syringe needle. The infusion speed of the solution in
the syringe was 1 mL/h at 25 kV.

4.2 Surface
Characterization by Goniometric Analysis
A static sessile
drop method employing a goniometer (CAM 100, KSV
Instruments Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) was used to characterize the
nanoscaffold surface. This surface characterization was performed
by capturing the image of a liquid drop and recording its shape as
a function of time. The image was captured at a rate of 10 frames
per second with 10 repetitions using a FireWire connectable CCD camera
with 50 mm optics. Only the results having a standard deviation of
less than 2° were included in the study. The contact angle, ranging
from 1 to 180° with an accuracy of ±0.1°, was measured,
and the curve fitting was performed based on the Young–Laplace
equation.

4.3 Characterization of Nanofiber Diameter by
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy
(EDS)
A ZEISS SIGMA VP scanning electron microscope (Carl
Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood, NY) was used to take images of nanofibers.
Fiber diameters in the SEM images were measured using NIH ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To study the astrocytes
grown on nanofibers, the samples were dehydrated with graded ethanol
and dried with hexamethyldisilazane. Then the samples were coated
with gold and studied using SEM.

Backscattered electron images
in the SEM display compositional contrast that results from different
atomic number elements and their distribution. EDS can identify the
particular elements and their relative proportions in the carbon-nanomaterial-loaded
nanofibers. Elemental analysis and chemical characterization were
performed using a ZEISS SIGMA VP SEM. Data was collected from multiple
locations including the fibers and the bead-like globules.

4.4 Chemical Characterization by Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
FTIR measurements were performed
using a ThermoNicolet Avatar 360 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer,
which was configured for transmittance. Spectra were collected from
the mid-infrared region (4000–400 cm–1) using
90 scans at a resolution of 16 cm–1 with the detector
positioned perpendicular to the fiber direction. Three measurements
were taken per sample for a total of three samples per set.

4.5 Dielectric Characterization
The effect
of nanoparticles in the dielectric constant of PCL was measured using
an Automatic Capacitance Bridge. It has a resolution of 0.8 aF.

4.6 Astrocyte Culture
The procedure for
isolating the astrocytes from neonatal rats was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and completed at Wichita State
University in Wichita, Kansas.42,43 In brief, cerebral
cortexes were isolated from the brains of neonatal rats (postnatal
day P1-2 rats) after they were sacrificed. The cortex tissues were
triturated gently through a 5 mL syringe with a needle. The tissue
suspension was passed through a 70 mm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon,
Durham, NC), and the flow-through was collected with a 50 mL conical
tube. The isolated cells were cultured for about 7–14 days.
After reaching confluency, the cultures were shaken to remove macrophages
and progenitor cells. The adherent astrocytes were cultured subsequently
for cell–nanofiber interaction. The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
The medium was changed every 2–3 days, and the cell culture
was incubated with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

4.7 Growth of Astrocytes on Nanoscaffolds and
Viability Assay
The electrospun scaffolds were cut as circle
membranes that can exactly fit and cover the bottom of the culture
well of 24 well plate wells. Silicone O-rings (Ace O-ring, silicone,
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were then used to fix the membrane to
the bottom of the wells. Using the standard procedure, astrocytes
were seeded into a 24 well plate with electrospun fibers attached
to the bottom of the cell culture dish. About 50000 cells were seeded
in each well, and the cells were incubated for 4 days. The viability
and proliferation of astrocytes that were seeded on the nanofibers
were studied by monitoring their metabolic activity using the alamarBlue
assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Then they were incubated
with an astrocyte culture medium containing 10% (v/v) alamarBlue reagent
for 3 h. Absorbance was measured at wavelengths of 570 and 600 nm
in a microplate reader (Synergy Mx Monochromator-Based Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader, Winooski, VT).

4.8 Immunocytochemistry
and SEM Imaging of the
Nanofibers Seeded with Astrocytes
The cultured astrocytes
on nanofibers were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were exposed to a blocking solution
(10% horse serum and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min. Then the
cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) to determine the cell phenotype. The secondary antibody
was Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA). Nuclei were stained with diamidino-2-phenylindole.
The labeled cells were viewed using a Carl Zeiss fluorescence microscope.

To prepare the SEM test, the chemical dehydration procedure was
performed for the nanofiber scaffolds seeded with astrocytes. First,
the samples were washed with PBS and placed in 2% glutaraldehyde PBS
for 2 h. The samples were then dehydrated with graded ethanol (50,
70, 90%, and pure ethanol) followed by hexamethyldisilazane treatment.
The air-dried samples were then coated with gold before they were
analyzed by SEM.

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Statistical
analysis was conducted with one-way ANOVA. A p-value
of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Data were
expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
