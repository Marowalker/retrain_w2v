The surface assembly of 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin
(OEP) using silicon tetrachloride as a coupling agent was investigated
using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Nanopatterned films of Si-OEP
were prepared by protocols of colloidal lithography to evaluate the
morphology, thickness, and molecular orientation for samples prepared
on Si(111). The natural self-stacking of porphyrins can pose a challenge
for molecular patterning. When making films on surfaces, porphyrins
will self-associate to form co-planar configurations of random stacks
of molecules. There is a tendency for the flat molecules to orient
spontaneously in a side-on arrangement that is mediated by physisorption
to the substrate as well as by π–π interactions
between macrocycles to form a layered arrangement of packed molecules,
analogous to a stack of coins. When silicon tetrachloride is introduced
to the reaction vessel, the coupling between the surface and porphyrins
is mediated through covalent Si–O bonding. For these studies,
surface structures of Si-OEP were formed that are connected with a
Si–O–Si motif to a silicon atom coordinated to the center
of the porphyrin macrocycles. Protocols of colloidal lithography were
used as a tool to prepare surface structures and films of Si-OEP to
facilitate surface characterizations. Conceptually, by arranging the
macrocycles of porphyrins with defined orientation, local AFM surface
measurements can be enabled to help address mechanistic questions
about how molecules self-assemble and bind to substrates.

Introduction
Porphyrins are excellent
materials for molecular electronics, due
to their diverse structural motifs and associated electrical, optical,
and chemical properties and thermal stability.1−6 The rigid planar structures and π-conjugated macrocycles of
porphyrins inherently convey stability and robust electrical characteristics.
Porphyrins have a macrocyclic tetrapyrrole structure, which may be
functionalized with various substituents.7 Modifications of the macrocycle, peripheral groups, or bound metal
ions can generate a range of electrical and photoelectrical properties.8 At a basic level, electronic properties of porphyrins
are controlled by the degree of π delocalization of the conjugated
rings.9 Porphyrins can be organized into
supramolecular arrays, aggregates, and crystals with diverse functions.
The diverse architectures of porphyrins have been used for applications
such as gas sensors,10,11 phototherapeutics,12,13 photovoltaic cells,14−17 photocatalysis,18,19 organic light-emitting diodes,20−23 molecular wires,24,25 and as components for molecular-based
electronic devices.26−30

The orientation of porphyrins on surfaces is determined by
factors
such as the nature of the peripheral substituents and their position
on the macrocycle.31,32 When preparing surface films,
the planar macrocycles of porphyrins spontaneously self-associate
to form stacked structures. This natural capability of self-stacking
has been a hurdle for developing processes for molecular patterning,
since porphyrins do not form chemisorbed or covalent bonds to surfaces
unless a peripheral group is added to the macrocycle to facilitate
bonding. Due to the structural nature of tetrapyrrole molecules of
porphyrins, the supramolecular organization of nanomaterials and films
is driven by forces such as metal–ligand bonds, noncovalent
ionic bonds, hydrogen bonding, π–π interactions,
electrostatic and other intermolecular forces including van der Waals
forces.33−35 There is a tendency for the flat molecules to orient
in a co-planar arrangement that is mediated by physisorption to the
substrate as well as by electrostatic interactions between macrocycles
to form layers of packed molecules in a co-facial arrangement, analogous
to a stack of coins.

There is considerable precedent for studies
of the synthesis,
structures, and properties of porphyrins, and our studies build on
such information. Several synthetic approaches have been reported
for binding porphyrins to surfaces by designing peripheral groups
to facilitate surface self-assembly, as a strategy to enable stronger
bonding between the molecules and substrate. By incorporating thiols
in peripheral groups of the molecular design, porphyrins can be linked
to metal surfaces by chemisorption.36−41 A silicon substrate was functionalized with 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane
(APTMS) to link 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin to surface
amines using a urea coupling reaction with 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate.42 Zinc and iron porphyrins were attached to silicon
substrates functionalized with APTMS by forming an amide bond between
the conjugated macrocycle and surface amino groups that were activated
by carboxydiimidazole.43 The nitrogen of
pyridyl moieties was linked to chloro groups of chloromethylphenylsilane
to attach tetrapyridyl porphyrin (TPyP) to functionalized Si(100)
substrates.44 Cobalt tetraphenyl porphyrins
were functionalized with peripheral groups of amines for binding to
gold substrates, as reported by Lokesh et al.45 As a strategy to covalently bind porphyrin to surfaces of Si(100)
and quartz substrates, multilayer thin films were prepared with TPyP
by coating the surface with [p-(chloromethyl)phenyl]
trichlorosilane as a coupling layer and then assembling sequential
layers with linkers connected to pyridyl groups of the porphyrin ring.46,47 Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactivity, commonly
referred to as “click” chemistry, has also been used
for binding porphyrins to surfaces.48,49

In previous
reports, nanostructures of silicon complexes of porphyrins
and phthalocyanines were successfully prepared using silane coupling
to form covalently bound structures on surfaces of silicon, glass,
and indium tin oxide (ITO).50−52 The silicon atom is bound tightly
to the centers of the porphyrin rings by four nitrogens of the conjugated
rings. Porphyrins with a nonmetal element such as silicon have two
chlorides connected at opposite faces of the macrocycles that facilitate
reactions for binding to a surface as well as to form covalent bonds
to additional molecules. The synthesis and characterization of several
hexacoordinate silicon porphyrins have been reported, including octaethylporphyrin,35 tetraphenylporphyrin,53−55 tetra-p-tolylporphyrin, and tetrakis(p-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)porphyrin.56 One-dimensional polymer wires of Si-porphyrin
were prepared on glass and ITO substrates using a silane coupling
strategy by Kanaizuka et al. in which a central Si atom was bound
to the center of the porphyrin macrocycle.50

Protocols of colloidal lithography employ a surface mask of
latex
or silica spheres and have been applied for patterning materials such
as polymers,57,58 proteins,59−65 rare-earth nanomaterials,66,67 nanoparticles,68,69 metals,70−76 organosilanes,77−80 and organothiols.81 We are developing
protocols using colloidal lithography to prepare surface films and
nanostructures with porphyrins that are covalently bound to silicon
substrates. The approach is based on reactions with silicon tetrachloride
(SiCl4) to form skewered molecules that are centrally interconnected
by covalent Si–O bonds. Using a “one-pot” reaction
with SiCl4, porphyrins are linked to surfaces by Si–O
bridges directly to a central Si atom inserted within the macrocycle.
Likewise, the macrocycles of porphyrins can be linked together by
hydrolysis and condensation steps to form chains with Si–O–Si
bridges between the macrocycles. This strategy provides capabilities
for controlling the configuration of the macrocycles in a co-facial
orientation with covalent bonds. The surface assemblies have been
referred to as a “shish kebob” arrangement in which
molecules are skewered together by Si–O–Si bridges.82 Bonds of Si–O are suitable for forming
connections to substrates such as silicon wafers, glass, mica, and
metal oxides. One may predict that the covalent nature of Si–O–Si
substrate linkages will impart stable, robust, and novel electronic
and photonic properties depending on the design of the macrocycles.
The chemical nature of surface linkages is a critical variable for
designing heterojunctions in configurations for molecular electronics.

Herein, we present results for linking porphyrins with Si–O–Si
skewers to Si(111) using 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin (OEP),
which is a free-base porphyrin that has eight ethyl groups at pyrrole
positions of the macrocycle. Nanopatterning protocols were implemented
to facilitate the preparation of well-defined interfaces with nanometer-level
control of the spacing and composition of patterned elements. Colloidal
lithography with silica spheres provides a practical approach to pattern
molecules by masking discrete areas of the surface from molecular
deposition. When the mask is removed, bare areas of the substrate
are exposed that had been protected by the mask of spheres. The nanostructured
films contain nanoholes, which provide an in situ reference for measuring
film thickness and also adventitiously furnish landmarks to enable
side-by-side comparisons of surface morphology using studies with
atomic force microscopy (AFM) (e.g., substrate vs film).

Results and Discussion
Three types of surface platforms were prepared using protocols
of colloidal lithography to evaluate the morphology and thickness
of Si-OEP nanostructures grown on Si(111) surfaces. First, a film
of Si-OEP was prepared that contained nanoholes of an uncovered substrate
that had been protected by a surface mask of silica spheres. After
the mask was removed, the local areas of Si(111) within nanoholes
furnished a baseline for measuring the thickness of the film which
surrounded the nanoholes. In the second nanopatterning strategy, the
drying conditions of the masked substrate were altered to generate
ring-shaped nanostructures. The third strategy for preparing samples
was to make patterns of Si-OEP nanodots within a matrix film of octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS). In the third example, the initial height of the OTS film provided
a reference scale for measuring the growth of Si-OEP nanostructures
within the nanoholes. Molecular-level characterizations with AFM were
used to obtain direct views of Si-OEP nanostructures produced by surface
self-assembly.

Samples of Nanoholes within a Film of Si-OEP
The steps
for fabricating nanoholes within a film of Si-OEP are illustrated
in Figure 1. An aqueous
solution of monodisperse silica spheres was deposited onto a clean
Si(111) substrate and then dried in air. The spheres spontaneously
formed close-packed layers on an atomically flat substrate when dried
in ambient conditions to furnish a surface mask for patterning (Figure 1A). The substrate
with a mask of spheres was dried in ambient conditions then placed
into an oven to temporarily anneal the silica beads to the surface,
to prevent the spheres from being washed away during the immersion
step. After the drying and annealing step, the masked substrate was
then placed into a solution of OEP (0.5 mM in chloroform containing
an excess of SiCl4) to initiate coupling of porphyrin and
silane (Figure 1B).
In the final step, the mask of silica spheres was removed by sonication
and rinsing to generate nanoholes of an uncovered substrate within
a matrix film of Si-OEP (Figure 1C). The thickness of the film grew taller with longer
immersion intervals. Control samples were prepared without using SiCl4 and also for a continuous film prepared without a surface
mask; AFM images of the control experiments are provided in Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Basic steps
for generating nanoholes within a film of Si-OEP using
colloidal lithography. (A) An aqueous solution of silica spheres was
deposited on a clean Si(111) substrate and dried. (B) The surface
with the particle mask was immersed in a solution of OEP and SiCl4 in chloroform for a one-pot reaction. (C) The sample was
rinsed with sonication to remove the particle mask to generate nanoholes
of uncovered substrate within an OEP film.

An example of the interesting morphology of a nanostructured
film
of skewered molecules of OEP bound to Si(111) through Si–O
bridges is shown in Figure 2, after the mask of colloidal Si spheres was rinsed away from
the surface. Areas of the film have a distinctive morphology of individual
strands of skewered porphyrins which grow vertically from the surface
which are not interconnected. The sample has a hexagonal arrangement
of circular dark holes surrounded by a film of Si-OEP. Microscopic
scratches formed by the polishing of silicon wafers used as substrates
appear as diagonal grooves which are attributable to the roughness
of the underlying substrate. In this example, the nanoholes were generated
using a surface mask of monodisperse 500 nm silica spheres prepared
by drying an aqueous suspension of colloidal silica in ambient conditions,
followed by a brief annealing step (3 h). After drying, water persists
throughout the sample in areas surrounding and between silica spheres
of the surface mask. The masked substrate was then cooled and immersed
in a solution of OEP and SiCl4 for 24 h. The bright areas
are regions of Si-OEP, and the darker areas are the holes where the
particle mask was removed (Figure 2A). The successive zoom-in views (Figure 2B,C) disclose an interesting
topology, the areas of Si-OEP film are punctuated with small disks
of the macrocycles. The regular sizes and shapes of the disks suggest
a mostly co-planar orientation of columns of flat Si-OEP molecules
that do not interconnect in lateral directions. The location, size,
and arrangement of the nanoholes are also resolved in the simultaneously
acquired phase images (Figure 2E–G). There are 37 nanoholes within the 4 × 4
μm2 frame, which have fairly regular sizes and shapes
indicating the sites where silica spheres were removed. The spacing
between the nanoholes is ∼500 nm, which is derived from the
geometry and arrangement of the particles of the surface mask. Within
the nanoholes are exposed sites of substrate that were uncovered
when the silica spheres were rinsed away. Example line profiles traced
across the nanoholes are shown in Figure 2D,H. The average depth of the nanoholes measured
17 ± 4 nm referencing the uncovered holes as a baseline for cursor
measurements. The error term is an estimate of the background roughness
of the line profiles. The surface coverage measured ∼94% for
the film of Si-OEP shown in Figure 2, the remaining areas are circles of exposed substrate.

The widths of the Si-OEP disks
are larger than would be expected
for an individual macrocycle, because the AFM probe is much larger
than the surface features. An ultrasharp probe could likely reveal
the true lateral dimensions, in future planned experiments. The molecules
do not interconnect in lateral xy directions, which
is evident by the way the AFM probe outlines multiple, discrete circular
features of highly regular sizes. The molecular assembly seems to
occur only in the vertical direction with planar porphyrins assembling
on the top of the macrocycles in a concatenated arrangement. The thickness
of the film is not uniform. The values measured from individual cursor
profiles across 50 nanoholes ranged from 5 to 24 nm in depth (the
size distribution is included as Figure S3, Supporting Information). The thickness measurements indicate that
a multilayered film was formed of 16–75 Si-OEP units, which
are interconnected by Si–O–Si linkers, using an estimate
of 0.32 nm for each porphyrin unit of the skewered assemblies. The
0.32 nm value is based on the theoretical length of Si–O–Si
bonds.

The results in Figure 2 were acquired at a time point of 24 h of substrate
immersion.
Future planned experiments will address the kinetic details of surface
assembly by evaluating changes in sample morphology after shorter
reaction intervals.

Evidence that Si was successfully coordinated
to the macrocycles
of OEP can be readily detected by observing shifts in Soret and Q
bands using UV/vis spectroscopy. Structural changes of the central
atom or pendant substituents on the ring will affect the transition
energies profiled in absorbance spectra. The absorption bands in systems
of chromophoric porphyrins arise from electronic transitions between
the two highest occupied molecular orbitals and two lowest unoccupied
molecular orbitals of the aromatic rings of the macrocycle, indicating
π–π transitions.83 When
SiCl4 was added to a solution of OEP, there is a characteristic
redshift for the broad Soret band centered around 400 nm, which can
be attributed to changes in molecular geometry when a Si atom is incorporated
within the macrocycle (Figure 3). Differences in spectra for the Q bands were also detected,
see the Supporting Information, Figure S4.

redshift of the intense Soret band of OEP after reaction with SiCl4.

Ring-Shaped Nanostructures
of Si-OEP
Ring-shaped nanostructures
of Si-OEP stacks were produced by altering the conditions for drying
the surface mask of silica spheres. Ring-shaped morphologies have
been reported previously for samples prepared by approaches with colloidal
lithography.62,67,78−80,84,85 A sample was prepared with oven drying by heating a masked Si(111)
substrate at 150 °C for 20 h and then immediately placing the
dried sample into a solution of OEP and SiCl4 in chloroform
for 5 h. By heating the substrate for longer intervals (up to 20 h),
most of the water throughout the surface was driven to evaporate,
and only nanoscopic residues of moisture persisted in the water meniscus
sites at the base of the particles. The shapes and arrangement of
the nanorings are shown in Figure 4 where a few trace adsorbates of Si-OEP can be detected
in areas in between the rings. Molecules of Si-OEP deposited at meniscus
sites to form a ring-shaped arrangement surrounding the base of the
silica spheres of the surface mask. The beads were completely removed
by the steps of rinsing with sonication. The covalent attachment of
Si-OEP ensured that the porphyrin film was not removed during solvent
rinses, however, the physisorbed silica beads were readily rinsed
away to generate a nanostructured organic film, despite the annealing
step.

the drying conditions of the surface mask. The masked substrate was
dried in an oven at 150 °C before immersion in the reaction vessel.

Si-OEP nanoring, 600 × 600 nm2; (D) corresponding
phase image. (E) Cursor profile of the line traced in (C). Images
were acquired with tapping-mode AFM in air.

There are about 30 nanorings within the topography image
of Figure 4A, which
scales to
a surface density of ∼108 nanostructures/cm2. The simultaneously acquired phase image discloses that the
surrounding areas of substrate present different surface chemistry
than the areas of the nanorings (Figure 4B). Molecules of Si-OEP did not bind in areas
without residual water, the step of heated drying removed water from
regions of the substrate in between silica particles to prevent the
growth of a continuous film. A close-up view of a single nanoring
is shown in Figure 4C. An arrangement of round disks of Si-OEP assembled to form regular
circular shapes surrounding a hole containing uncovered substrate.
Fine details of the edges and shapes as well as the surface chemistry
of the nanorings are mapped in the corresponding phase image (Figure 4D).

Attachment
of Si-OEP takes place at surface sites that follow the
shape of the water meniscus which forms at the base of colloidal
spheres of a surface mask. The size and shapes of the water meniscus
areas are remarkably uniform at the nanoscale. An example cursor measurement
across a single ring reveals the multilayer geometry (Figure 4E). The average height of the
nanorings measured 6.8 ± 1.5 nm (n = 50). Since
there is variability in the heights of the nanorings, both a vertical
and horizontal profile of 50 individual rings was acquired to generate
a representative measurement. The average value of four measurement
points at the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the nanorings
was used to gauge the height. With colloidal lithography, the process
scales up to tens of millions of surface features of similar geometry,
thickness, and composition. Essentially, colloidal lithography provides
a means to pattern water on substrates, and molecules of Si-porphyrin
bind selectively to the locations of the wetted substrate.

Nanodots
of Si-OEP within an OTS Matrix
Nanostructures
of Si-OEP were fabricated within a methyl-terminated resist layer
by localizing the reaction to confined sites of nanoholes within a
film of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) that was prepared using an
immersion step with colloidal lithography. Nanoholes within a film
of methyl-terminated OTS was used to furnish nanoscopic containers
for depositing Si-porphyrin. In previous studies, we have successfully
used OTS as a generic matrix with colloidal lithography to pattern
4-(chloromethyl)phenyl trichlorosilane,86 polymers,57 proteins,61,87 rare-earth oxide nanoparticles,88 as
well as free-base and metallated porphyrins.89 Methyl-terminated decyltrichlorosilane was used as a resist for
patterning OTS by Brownfield et al.79 Patterns
of n-docosane, aspirin, and clarithromycin were produced
within a matrix of OTS, as reported by Wang et al.80 Beyond colloidal lithography, matrices of OTS have also
been used with other nanolithography approaches for patterning organic
films to attach carbon nanotubes,90 metal
wires,91 nanoparticles,92,93 and proteins.94

The steps for spatially
selective deposition of Si-OEP into uncovered nanoholes within an
OTS film are depicted in Figure 5. Nanoholes of unprotected Si(111) were prepared by
removing the particle mask. The sites of nanoholes were used to direct
and confine the deposition and subsequent vertical layer-by-layer
assembly of Si-OEP. In the first step (Figure 5A), colloidal lithography was used to generate
a template of nanoholes of an uncovered substrate within a thin film
of OTS using a surface mask of colloidal spheres. After removing the
mask (Figure 5B), the
areas that had been protected by the spheres furnish circular sites
of uncovered Si substrate, which present hydroxyl groups, surrounded
by a passivating layer of methyl-terminated OTS. In the final step,
the substrate with nanoholes was placed into the porphyrin and SiCl4 solution for a one-pot coupling reaction. After the reaction,
the sample was removed and rinsed successively with chloroform and
water for characterization with AFM (Figure 5C).

Figure 5 Procedure for preparing OEP nanodots within
a resist film of OTS.
(A) A particle mask was prepared on Si(111). The colloidal mask protected
discrete circular areas from reaction when the sample was immersed
in a solution containing OTS. (B) After removing the mask, substrates
of nanoholes within an OTS matrix were formed. (C) After a second
immersion step in the OEP single-pot reaction, the substrates were
removed and dried for AFM characterization to reveal (C) nanodots
of OEP grown within the nanoholes.

An example of nanoholes produced by immersing a colloidal
mask
in a solution of OTS is presented in Figure 6. Most of the areas of the surface are covered
with a monolayer film of OTS on Si(111), however, discrete holes of
regular sizes are arranged throughout the sample according to the
hexagonal packing of the surface mask (Figure 6A). A magnified view of 12 nanoholes is shown
in Figure 6B, disclosing
the highly regular shapes of the circular features. The theoretical
length of OTS is 2.5 nm for an upright, fully extended orientation
of the hydrocarbon backbone. The depth of the nanoholes for the OTS
sample measured 2.3 ± 0.3 nm (n = 50) as shown
with an example cursor profile in Figure 6C, which suggests that the film was fairly
densely packed. The nanostructured film of OTS was used as a surface
template for directing the deposition of Si-OEP for the experiment
shown in Figure 7.

When a sample of nanoholes
was submerged in a solution of Si-OEP,
the porphyrins did not attach to areas of the sample protected by
OTS which present methyl groups. Molecules of Si-OEP assembled on
uncovered, bare areas inside the nanoholes to form nanostructures
of regular shapes and thickness, shown with representative AFM images
in Figure 7. The time
point for immersion of this example was 5 h, revealing heights that
measure 6 ± 1 nm (n = 50) above the OTS matrix.
In data not shown, immersion for 24 h formed taller structures measuring
8.7 ± 1.9 nm in height. These experiments provide mechanistic
clues of a layer-by-layer mode of surface assembly with Si-OEP that
produces taller structures as molecules are added over time. Intermolecular
Si–O–Si linkages form co-facially on the exposed face
of the surface-linked porphyrins, to interconnect with the central
Si atoms of the macrocycles in a skewered arrangement.

There
are about 68 nanodots of Si-OEP in the topograph of Figure 7A, within a 6 ×
6 μm2 frame. The number of nanopatterns that can
be generated is controlled by the diameter of the particles chosen
for the colloidal mask, correspondingly more structures are generated
when smaller diameter spheres are used for lithography.95,96 The nanodots have a hexagonal arrangement, with a periodicity that
matches the diameter of the silica spheres (500 nm) used as a surface
mask. Close-up views of the Si-OEP nanodots are presented in Figure 7B,C, revealing a
morphology of multiple island aggregates packed within the nanocontainers.
The clustered protrusions can also be vaguely resolved in the simultaneously
acquired phase images of Figure 7D,E as small bumps inside the dark holes. The phase
images enable sensitive detection of adsorbates in areas between the
nanodots, in this example, no contaminants are observed on areas of
the OTS matrix film. An example cursor profile across two nanostructures
is shown in Figure 7F, with heights measuring 5.1 and 4.3 nm.

At the nanoscale,
there is variability for the heights of the nanodots,
shown in the histograms of Figure 8. With an immersion time of 5 h, the heights above
the OTS matrix ranged from 3 to 9 nm, with an average value of 5.8
± 1.3 nm. With a longer immersion time of 24 h, the heights ranged
from 6 to 13 nm, with an average value of 8.7 ± 1.9 nm. The mean
values of the two data sets (5 and 24 h) are statistically different,
compared using a paired t-test at the 99.5 percentile.
The variability of the heights of nanodots can be attributed to slight
changes in the diameters of the nanoholes which occur naturally from
variations of particle sizes of the surface mask as well as surface
imperfections.

Role of Water in Surface Binding
Water directs the
surface placement of the initial layer of Si-OEP and also has a role
in the addition of further molecules to form a skewered multilayer.
The particle masks were found to effectively block molecules from
depositing underneath spheres at the points of direct contact with
the substrate, molecules of Si-OEP were directed to assemble at interstitial
sites in between the silica beads or at meniscus sites at the wetted
areas of the substrate. Organosilane nanostructures of selected morphologies
can be fabricated with colloidal lithography by controlling certain
experimental parameters such as concentration, immersion intervals,
and the drying conditions for the surface mask. In ambient conditions,
a layer of water forms on surfaces; trace amounts of water initiate
self-assembly of organosilanes to form a molecularly thin organic
film. Through trial and error, we have learned that the nature of
the substrate can influence silanization reactions. For example, with
the relatively hydrophilic surface of mica, water will spread out
to form a continuous layer which will correspondingly generate organic
films of uniform thickness throughout areas of the sample. However,
with hydrophobic substrates such as Si(111), the nature of the surface
directs organosilane assembly according to the arrangement of water
deposits.97 For colloidal lithography protocols,
the amount of water present on the surface can be controlled by altering
the drying conditions of the masked substrate before the immersion
step.79,98

The key differences when comparing
the surface morphology of samples of Figures 2 and 4 were the drying
conditions of the surface mask used for preparing samples with colloidal
lithography and the intervals for immersion in Si-OEP. The process
for attaching silanes to substrates requires nanoscopic residues of
water on the surface; areas with thicker layers of water will furnish
sites for self-polymerization to produce multilayered films. With
colloidal lithography, the locations of water on the surface define
the reaction sites for attaching SiCl4 and OEP. In essence,
the drying step of colloidal lithography is a way to control the shapes
and thickness of Si-OEP nanostructures. In ambient conditions, we
know that macroscopic residues of moisture form on mirrors and glass
surfaces to form water films or fog. Intuitively with colloidal lithography,
by drying a sample in air under ambient conditions, the entire surface
would have a film of water throughout the sample, except at sites
protected by the particle mask. Therefore, an ambient drying step
produces a film of molecules with nanoholes in areas where the particles
of the mask were removed as revealed in the example of Figure 2. However, when using a heated
drying step for the particle mask, nanorings were produced in areas
where water persisted selectively at the meniscus sites surrounding
the base of the silica spheres, as shown in Figure 4. When using silica spheres of smaller diameter,
the size of the meniscus is smaller and the corresponding ring nanopatterns
are smaller in size. Thus, colloidal lithography provides a tool for
controlling the sites of reactions at the nanoscale as well as providing
a way to choose the geometry and spacing between patterns of nanoholes
or nanorings.

Conclusions
Nanostructured films,
nanorings, and nanodots of Si-OEP were patterned
through covalent Si–O–Si bonds using a silane coupling
reaction combined with colloidal lithography. Molecules were added
over time to form multilayers, as demonstrated by measuring the changes
in height after increasing the time intervals for immersing silicon
substrates from 5 to 24 h. With colloidal lithography, the geometry
of nanostructures was affected by the drying step of preparing surface
masks, which defines the placement of water residues on the surface.
The nanostructures consisted of multiple strands of porphyrin stacks
that assembled from the surface through a siloxane backbone attached
covalently to the central Si atom of the macrocycles in a skewered
arrangement. The experimental results with Si-OEP provide a basis
for developing protocols with other porphyrins and can likely be extended
to phthalocyanines which have a macrocycle comprised of four isoindole
groups linked by nitrogen atoms. Further directions will be to study
the role of substitutions with peripheral groups, (phenyl, methyl,
pyridyl, polar, nonpolar, etc.) as well as the effects of symmetry
for modification of the macrocycle. Our goals are to correlate nanoscale
properties (conductance, photocurrent generation) with designed surface
structures of porphyrins in which the coupling between the surface
and porphyrins is mediated by stable covalent interactions.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Reagents
Precut polished silicon wafers
Si(111) were purchased from Ted Pella, Inc. (Redding, CA). Octadecyltrichlorosilane
(OTS) was obtained from Acros Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific (New
Jersey). Silicon tetrachloride and 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin
(OEP) were obtained from TCI America (Portland, OR). Size-sorted silica
spheres (500 nm) were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Fremont, CA).
Chloroform (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) was acquired
from Fisher Scientific (Lenexa, KS). Concentrated sulfuric acid (98.0%)
(J.T. Baker, Fisher Scientific) and hydrogen peroxide (30%) (British
Drug Houses, VWR) were used to prepare piranha solution. Ethanol was
purchased from Deacon Labs (Prussia, PA) and used as received. Anhydrous
toluene was purchased from Merck Millipore (Billerica, MA).

UV/Vis
Spectroscopy
Absorbance spectra were acquired
with a Cary model 50 UV/vis spectrophotometer from Varian Instruments
(Santa Clara, CA).

Atomic Force Microscopy
Samples
were characterized
using a model 5500 atomic force microscope (Keysight Technologies,
Santa Rosa, CA). Results were acquired using a tapping-mode AFM. Unless
otherwise specified, the error values for cursor measurements indicate
the standard deviation of multiple line profiles. Nonconductive silicon
nitride tips were used for AFM studies. Tapping-mode images were acquired
using tips with an average spring constant between 10 and 130 N/m
and resonance frequencies ranging from 272 to 464 kHz (Nanosensors,
Neuchatel, Switzerland). Digital images were processed using Gwyddion
software, which is supported by the Czech Metrology Institute.99

Preparation of Nanostructured Films of Si-OEP
An immersion
procedure was used to generate a thin film of Si-OEP on Si(111). Precut
polished silicon wafers (Virginia Semiconductor, Frederickburg, VA)
were rinsed with ultrapure water and then immersed in piranha solution
for 1.5 h to remove surface contaminants. Piranha solution is a mixture
of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid with a (v/v) ratio of 1:3.
Caution: piranha solution is highly corrosive and should be handled
with great care. Next, the substrates were removed and rinsed with
water. Thin films were made by adding 2.9 μL of neat SiCl4 to 5 mL of a solution of OEP (0.5 mM) in chloroform. Silicon
substrates were placed in the OEP solution to react for 5 h. The samples
were then removed from the solution, rinsed with ethanol and ultrapure
water, and sonicated in chloroform. Next, the samples were dried under
nitrogen and subsequently characterized with AFM.

Preparation
of Nanopatterns
An aqueous suspension of
silica spheres was prepared by successive cycles of centrifugation
to remove contaminants. After centrifuging an aqueous solution of
500 nm silica spheres (0.2 mL), the supernatant was decanted and replaced
with deionized water (0.2 mL). The spheres of the pellet were resuspended
using vortex mixing. The process was repeated three times to ensure
complete removal of contaminants. Next, an aliquot (10 μL) of
the suspension was deposited onto a clean piece of silicon and dried
in air. The samples were then placed into an oven at 150 °C for
time intervals ranging from 3 to 20 h.

To prepare patterns of
nanoholes within a film of OTS, the substrate with a mask of silica
spheres was immersed in a solution of OTS (0.1% in anhydrous toluene)
for 5 h. The sample was then removed from the solution and further
rinsed with ethanol and deionized water. Next, the surface mask of
spheres was removed by sonication in ethanol and water. Nanopatterns
of OEP were prepared by immersing the sample with nanoholes within
an OTS matrix into a solution containing OEP and SiCl4 in
chloroform for 5 or 24 h. The samples were removed and rinsed in ethanol
and water followed by sonication in chloroform, then characterized
with AFM.
