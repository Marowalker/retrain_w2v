MoS2 is a 2D material that has been widely used in supercapacitor
applications because of its layered structure that provides a large
surface area and allows for high electric double-layer charge storage.
To enhance the cycling stability and capacitance of MoS2, it is usually mixed with carbon materials. However, the dependence
of the charge storage mechanism
on the structure of the carbon material is still unclear in literature.
Herein, the effect of the structure of the carbon material on the
charge storage mechanism in 2H flower-shaped MoS2 is investigated
in detail. Specifically, 2H MoS2 was mixed with either
8 nm-diameter carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene nanoflakes (GNFs)
in different weight ratios. Also, a composite of MoS2,
CNTs, and GNFs (1:1:1) was also studied. The charge storage mechanism
was found to depend on the structure and content of the carbon material.
Insights into the possible storage mechanism(s) were discussed. The
MoS2/CNT/GNF composite showed a predominant pseudocapacitive
charge storage mechanism where the diffusion current was ∼89%,
with 88.31% of the resulted capacitance being due to faradic processes.

Introduction
Supercapacitors (SCs)
have attracted much attention as the next-generation
power storage devices, mainly because of their outstanding cycling
life, safe operation, and higher power density than fuel cells and
batteries.1−3 However, the bottleneck preventing their large-scale
production and utilization is their comparatively low energy density.4 In this regard, pseudocapacitive materials, such
as metal oxides and metal sulfides, have primarily been used in SC
devices because of their high capacitance compared to carbonaceous
materials.5,6 Whereas pseudocapacitive materials store
charges via rapid and reversible faradaic reactions at the electrode
surface, capable of storing higher energy, carbonaceous materials
store energy physically via the formation of the electric double layer
(EDL) with lower energy storage but higher cycle life stability.5,7−12 In this regard, layered materials, such as MoS2, have
the ability to intercalate with ions in the electrolyte through a
faradic process (diffusion), acting as a pseudocapacitor. Unfortunately,
pseudocapacitors have a limitation of losing stability over time.13 To overcome the drawbacks of the two types of
materials, researchers are using hybrid electrodes of both carbon
and MoS2 together. Understanding the charge storage mechanism
is the primary step to enhance the capacitance performance of the
material.14−16

Among the various materials studied, two-dimensional
metal dichalcogenides
have been investigated as promising candidates for SCs.17,18 Specifically, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has recently
been investigated for the applications in charge storage because of
its graphene-like layered structure and the possibility to uphold
faradic process reactions.19−23 MoS2 consists of two sheets of S sandwiching a sheet
of Mo and the layers are connected together through van der Waal’s
forces. This structure results in a high surface area and allows the
intercalation of the ionic species from the electrolyte without high
distortion of the crystal structure, providing a pseudocapacitive
charge transfer character.17,24 MoS2 has
three main phases; the 3R and the 2H phases are semiconductors, and
the 1T phase has metallic properties.25,26 Whereas the
1T phase has a higher conductivity and capacitance, the 2H phase is
more structurally stable.4,25,27,28 The 2H MoS2 has a
low conductivity and low cycling stability, which affect its capacitance
performance. In order to increase the capacitance of MoS2, it is usually mixed with carbon materials.29−31

Although
a plethora of studies have focused on the performance
of carbon/MoS2 composites, the effect of the shape and
amount of the carbon material on the charge storage mechanism is yet
to be explored. Herein, the charge storage mechanism in 2H MoS2 with and without carbon additives was explored in detail.
The 2H MoS2 was mixed with different proportions of either
8 nm diameter carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or graphene nanoflakes (GNFs)
and the effect of the structure and content of the carbon material
on the charge storage performance and mechanism in MoS2 was explored in detail.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of the
As-Fabricated MoS2 and the
Composites
Figure 1a shows the X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-fabricated
MoS2, revealing diffraction peaks at 2θ of 14.25°,
33.3°, 39.7°, 58.68°, and 69°, which can be attributed
to the (002), (100), (105), (110), and (201) planes, respectively.
This indicates the 2H hexagonal structure of the as-fabricated MoS2 (JCPDS 37-1492).32 The high intensity
of the (002) peak reveals a well-crystalline layered structure along
the c-axis with a calculated interlayer spacing of
0.62 nm, which is the ideal spacing in the MoS2 hexagonal
crystals.32,33 To further investigate the crystal structure
of the MoS2, Raman spectroscopy was performed as shown
in Figure 1b. The Raman
spectra showed two main peaks at 376 and 404 cm–1, corresponding to the in-plane E2g1 vibration and the vertical plane A1g vibration that occur in the Mo–S bond of the hexagonal 2H-MoS2 phase, respectively.19,34 The composition and
chemical states of the elements of the synthesized MoS2 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
The XPS survey of MoS2 (Figure 2a) showed a predominance of the elements
Mo, S, C, and O. The high-resolution spectra of the O 1s (Figure 2d) revealed a main
peak at a binding energy of 531.8 eV, which can be attributed to adsorbed
oxygen from air.35 The high-resolution
spectra of Mo (Figure 2b) showed two peaks at binding energies of 232.8 and 229.6 eV corresponding
to the Mo 3d3/2 and Mo 3d5/2, respectively,
with a spin orbit splitting of 3.2 eV, indicating an Mo(IV) valence
state.19 The high-resolution spectra of
S (Figure 2c) showed
two peaks at binding energies of 162.46 and 163.63 eV corresponding
to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, with
a spin orbit splitting of 1.17 eV, corresponding to the S2– valence state.19,36,37 Further investigation showed that the ratio between Mo and S in
the sample was 1:2.28, which proves the enriched sulfur content in
the sample. The XPS elemental mapping (Figure 2e,f) showed a uniform distribution of both
Mo and S atoms in the synthesized MoS2.

The morphological structure of the fabricated MoS2 was
investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HR-TEM) as shown in Figure 3a,b. The HR-TEM images confirm the layered structure of the
MoS2 and the lattice fingers were found to be 0.26 nm (Figure 3c), matching the d-spacing calculated from the XRD spectra. The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of the MoS2 showed
clear rings representing the (002), (100), (105), and (110) planes
of the hexagonal MoS2 structure (Figure 3c).

SAED patterns of the
as-fabricated MoS2.

The morphology of MoS2/CNTs and MoS2/GNF
composites was investigated using field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM). Figure 4a reveals the flower-like structure of pure MoS2, with different flower sizes ranging from 1 to 5 μm. The FESEM
image of the MoS2/CNTs composite (Figure 4b) shows the CNTs to be imbedded between
the layers of the MoS2 flowers, which can be ascribed to
the very small diameter (8 nm) of the used CNTs. With increasing the
amount of the added CNTs, the MoS2 surface becomes almost
completely covered with CNTs, Figure S1. For the MoS2/GNF composite (Figure 4c), the GNFs (1.0–2.5 μm) sandwiched
the MoS2 flowers. Upon reducing the ratio of the added
GNF, the MoS2 accumulated on the surface of the GNF and
the flower shape started to deform and collapse into a ball-like shape
as shown in Figure S1. For the MoS2/CNTs/GNF composite with equal weights (Figure 4d), both the MoS2 and the impeded
CNTs were sandwiched into the GNF. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) analysis of the active materials, Table S1, revealed a specific area of ∼7 m2/g for
the pure MoS2, which is enormously increased with increasing
the amount of CNTs to reach 180.6995 m2/g for the MCNT
1:3. On the contrary, the addition of GNF did not have a relatively
significant effect on the surface area of the prepared MoS2/GNF composites. By measuring the contact angle for the composites,
it was found that the added CNTs decreased wettability along with
diffusion of ions inside the MoS2 flowers, whereas the
GNFs increased the wettability along with the possibility of diffusion
of ions into the MoS2 flower. The insets in Figure 4 show the contact angles for
the composites MCG, MCNT 1:1, and MGNF 1:1.

contact angles.

Electrochemical Performance
of the Studied Materials
Materials can store charges via
two possible mechanisms. The first
one is based on the faradic charge transfer mechanism, namely, “Pseudocapacitive”,
during which the alkali metal cation from the electrolyte (here Na+) will diffuse between the layers of MoS2 and intercalate
with it.32,34 1  

The second charge storage mechanism
is due to a non-faradic process in which the charges accumulate on
the electrode/electrolyte interface, forming an electrical double
layer. In this mechanism, the charge is stored on the surface or near
it. 2  

To investigate the
electrochemical performance of the prepared
composites as potential SC electrodes, the cyclic voltammetries (CVs)
and charge/discharge characteristics were studied using a three-electrode
system in 0.5 Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Figure S2 shows the CVs of the studied materials
at different scan rates (from 10 to 1000 mV/s). Note that all studied
materials were able to maintain the semirectangular shape up to 500
mV/s. Figure 5a compares
the CVs of the studied materials at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Note
that the more the added CNTs or GNF to the MoS2, the more
ideal the rectangular shape appears, with the peaks starting to be
more flattened. The ideal rectangular shape of the CV indicates the
pure EDL capacitance charge storage mechanism, whereas the deviation
from the rectangular shape indicates the faradic pseudocapacitive
mechanism of the charge storage.7 The specific
capacitance of the prepared materials was calculated from the CVs
and is depicted in Figure 5b. At a scan rate of 10 mV/s, the specific capacitance of
the pure MoS2 was 58.35 F/g and that of the MCG composite
was 123.18 F/g. To investigate the origin of such increase in capacitance,
the capacitance of MCNT and MGNF with different ratios was also calculated.
The MCNT 1:3 showed a specific capacitance of 98.5 F/g, which was
decreased to 90.3 and 83.77 F/g for MCNT 1:1 and MCNT 3:1, respectively.
On the other hand, the MGNF 1:3 showed a specific capacitance of 74.68
F/g that was decreased to 69.98 and 55.33 F/g for MGNF 1:1 and MGNF
1:3, respectively. The results suggest that the CNTs may have the
leading role in the increment of the charge stored in the MCG, which
can be due to the large surface area of CNTs as estimated via the
BET measurements. Although the calculated active surface area was
larger for the CNT composites than for the MCG, the MCG specific capacitance
was larger than that of the CNT composites. We believe the reason
is that CNTs hinder the diffusion of ions into MoS2 layers.
At scan rates higher than 10 mV/s, the capacitance of the MoS2/CNT composites kept the same trend, Figure 5b. On the contrary, the MoS2/GNF
showed a reverse trend, where the MGNF 1:1 shows a higher capacitance
than that of MGNF 1:3. The charge/discharge analysis showed a similar
trend to the CV data. Figure S3 shows the
charge/discharge plots of the prepared materials at different applied
current densities (from 0.5 to 10 A/g). The selected charge/discharge
plots for the prepared materials at 1 A/g are presented in Figure 5c, revealing ideal
behavior of the pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism. The pseudocapacitive
behavior is believed to be due to the intercalation process between
the MoS2 and the Na ions in the electrolyte as indicated
by eq 1 above as MoS2 has empty orbitals that can intercalate with ions and the
layered structure of the MoS2 allows the diffusion of ions
in between the layers.

the studied materials; the mentioned percentage is after the 1000
cycle, (f) Nyquist plot for the studied materials in the frequency
range of 10 kHz to 100 mHz.

However, the discharge line is more flattened for the 1:3
MGNF
and MCNT, indicating that the charge storage mechanism is more directed
toward the ideal EDL charge storage mechanism.7 The calculated capacitance from the discharge curve shows a similar
trend to those calculated from the CV scans. The MoS2 specific
capacitance was 56 F/g at 0.5 A/g and increased to 104 F/g for the
MCG. Upon increasing the applied current density, the capacitance
of MoS2 decreased, whereas that of MoS2/CNT
composites showed the trend MCNT 1:3 > MCNT 1:1 > MCNT 3:1.
Similar
to those calculated from the CV scans, the MoS2/GNF composites
showed a different trend such that at a low applied current density,
the MGNF 1:3 showed the highest capacitance value between the three
tested MoS2/GNF composites. However, upon increasing the
applied current density, the MCNT 1:1 initially showed a higher capacitance
then returned back to the normal trend at a very high applied current
density (10 A/g). The energy density shows the same trend as the capacitance
calculated from the discharge plots (Figure 5d) with the energy density of MoS2 at 0.5 A/g reaching 145.152 W h/kg, which increased to 269.892 W
h/kg for the MCG. Figure 5e shows the plots of the capacitance retention over 1000 cycles
of charge/discharge at 1 A/g current density. The Coulombic efficiency
increased dramatically after the first 100 cycles and reached up to
95% after the first 500 cycles. The retention increased above 104%
after the first 10 cycles and continued to increase until the 100th
cycle because of the diffusion of ions in the pores of the materials
and possible improvement of the wettability of the material over time.38 The retention started to decrease after the
200th cycle and stabilized between the 700th and the 800th cycle.
The retention of the MoS2 after the 1000 cycle was 62.34%
and increased to 82.37% for the MCNT 1:3. For the MCG, the retention
reached 75.15% after the 1000 cycle with a capacitance of 61.32 F/g
at 1 A/g.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a
good tool to
elucidate the resistance of the working electrodes and investigate
the working mechanisms. Figure 5f shows the Nyquist plots of the studied materials, revealing
a small semicircle in the high-frequency regime and a tilted line
in the low-frequency regime. The smaller the semicircle, the higher
the conductivity of the material will be. The tilted line is due to
the Warburg impedance resulted from the diffusion of Na+ ions into the MoS2 sheets.19 The effect of the intercalation in the MoS2 affected
the ideal shape of the Nyquist plot.19 The
Nyquist plot was fitted using the equivalent electrical circuit shown
in Figure 5f, with
the detailed fittings represented in the inset. R1 represents the resistance of the solution, R2 represents the surface resistance, and W represents the Warburg impedance. Note that, at a high frequency,
the Warburg is small because of the low diffusion, whereas at a low
frequency, the Warburg resistance increases because of the increase
of the diffusion of ions into the materials.8Table S2 lists the fitting parameters,
where R1 does not vary between the different
materials. However, the Warburg impedance is lower for pure MoS2 and increases with increasing the amount of the added carbon
material (CNTs or GNFs).

The in-depth understanding of the obtained
results could be possible
via the analysis of the contribution of both EDL charge storage and
the diffusion intercalation charge storage to the obtained capacitance. Figure 6a shows a schematic
representation of the MCG charge storage mechanism in which the small
diameter (8 nm) CNTs are surrounding the MoS2 and the large
GNFs are sandwiching the MoS2. This structure would result
in maintaining both the large surface area (EDL capacitance) and allowing
the diffusion of ions to intercalate within the layers of the MoS2. To this end, Tafel’s relation was used to estimate
the EDL contribution. All tested materials resulted in b values (the intercept of the log i vs log v plot) that are ∼0.6, indicating the predominance
of the diffusion charge storage mechanism.14,15 Moreover, using Trasatti’s method,16 the total capacitance (EDL and the diffusion) was calculated. It
is worth mentioning that because of the used neutral electrolyte and
the high scan rate, the relations were not entirely linear.16 Thus, the fitting was done in the low scan rate
regime. Figure 6b shows
a representation of the percentage EDL capacitance and the diffusion
capacitance. It can be noticed that CNTs have the highest effect on
increasing the EDL contribution in the capacitance performance, which
can be related to their small size that favors the EDL mechanism.
However, GNFs only surround the MoS2 layers and contribute
their surface area to the original EDL of MoS2. From the
BET analysis, it was found that the addition of GNFs did not increase
the surface area that much; thus, GNFs did not show a significant
change in the contribution of the EDL capacitance. In general, it
was observed that the more contribution of EDL capacitance over the
diffusion capacitance led to higher overall capacitance. The plot
of v–1/2 versus i(v)/v1/2 was used to
estimate the percentage of the diffusion current at different scan
rates. Note that the linearity of the graph increases with increasing
the amount of added carbon material, indicating a more ideal behavior
and reduction in the Ohmic drop.15 The
results (Figure 6c)
showed that increasing the scan rate resulted in a decrease in the
percentage of the diffusion current. Also, upon increasing the percentage
of added carbon material, the percentage of the diffusion current
is greatly reduced. However, at a lower sweep voltage, the contribution
of the diffusion current is almost the same irrespective of the amount
of added carbon material. The contribution of the diffusion current
becomes significant at high sweep voltages, which can be ascribed
to the possibility that, at a high sweep voltage, the ions can reach
the interior of the CNTs and the GNFs, increasing the participation
of the EDL capacitance in the charge storage mechanism.

method, and (c) variation of diffusion current with scan rate.

Conclusions
We
demonstrate the successful fabrication of 2H MoS2 and its
composites with CNTs and GNFs. The capacitance of the fabricated
composites was found to depend on the structure of the carbon material.
The MoS2/CNT/GNF (1:1:1) composite showed a capacitance
retention of 75% after the 1000 cycle at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. In-depth
analysis of the origin of the charge storage mechanism was investigated.
The analysis indicated that by increasing the content of the carbon
material in the composite, the charge storage behavior is more directed
toward the EDL charge storage mechanism. The added CNTs to MoS2 increased the capacitance, the EDL capacity, and reduced
the percentage of diffusion current more than the added GNF counterpart.
The positive effects of CNTs were ascribed to their small diameters
and large surface area. Besides, CNTs enhanced the EDL contribution
more than the diffusion counterpart. On the other hand, the GNFs only
surrounded the MoS2 with limited surface area and without
interference with the diffusion of the ions into the MoS2.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Flower-Shaped MoS2
In a typical
synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets, 2.47 g of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and
0.76 g of CS(NH2)2 are dissolved in 60 mL of
distilled water (DW) under constant stirring. The mixture is transferred
to a 150 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and preheated at
200 °C for 24 h. The black precipitate is collected by centrifugation,
washed with DW and ethanol, and dried in an oven at 80 °C for
12 h. The produced powder is post-treated in a tube furnace (Carbolite)
at 800 °C under Ar atmosphere for 2 h.

Preparation of the Studied
Composites
The synthesized
MoS2 was mixed with CNTs (Sigma) in the ratios of 1:1,
1:3, and 3:1 wt %, then sonicated in 100 mL of DW for 30 min, and
finally dried overnight at 80 °C. The resulting composites are
named as MCNT 1:1, MCNT 1:3, and MCNT 3:1, respectively. The MoS2 was also mixed with GNFs (Sigma) in the ratios 1:1, 1:3,
and 3:1 wt %, then sonicated in 100 mL DW for 30 min, and finally
dried overnight at 80 °C. The resulting composites are labeled
MGNF 1:1, MGNF 1:3, and MGNF 3:1, respectively. Finally, the MoS2 was mixed with CNTs and GNFs in the ratio of 1:1:1 wt %,
then sonicated in 100 mL DW, and dried overnight at 80 °C. The
resulting composite is labeled MCG.

Characterization
The crystal structure and composition
of the MoS2 were investigated using an X-ray powder diffractometer
(Panalytical X’pert PRO MPD X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA), and XPS (ESCALAB 250XI,
Thermo Scientific), respectively. Raman spectroscopy was performed
using a dispersive Raman microscope (Pro Raman-L Analyzer) with an
excitation wavelength of 512 nm and laser power of 1 mW. HR-TEM (JOEL
JEM-2100) was used for imaging and selected area diffraction analysis.
The morphology and nanostructure of the studied samples were investigated
using the FESEM (Zeiss SEM Ultra 60, 5 kV). The accelerated surface
area and porosimetry were used for measuring the adsorption/desorption
of the nitrogen isotherm at −196 °C; the BET plot with
the nitrogen adsorption isotherm was used to indicate the specific
surface area.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical measurements
were performed using a three-electrode system. The working electrode
was prepared as a slurry of 80% active material, 10% carbon black,
and 10% polyvinylidene fluoride dissolved in dimethyl formamide on
a substrate of (1 × 1 cm2) graphite sheet. A (1 ×
1 cm2) Pt sheet was used as the counter electrode, a calomel
electrode was used as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements were
performed using a BioLogic SP-300 potentiostat. Cyclic voltammetry
(CV) measurements were carried out at scan rates from 10 to 1000 mV
s–1 in the potential window (−0.6 to 0.6
V). The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests were carried out
at different current densities (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 mA g–1). The EIS was carried out in the frequency range
of 10 kHz to 100 mHz.

Electrochemical Calculations
The
specific capacitance
can be calculated in F/g from the CVs through eq 3, where Cs is
the specific capacitance, I is the response current
density, v is the potential scan rate, ΔV is the potential window, and m is the
mass of the electrode material. 3  

The specific capacitance
can also be
calculated from the GCD graphs according to eq 4, where dt is the discharging
time (s), I is the discharging current (A), m is the mass of the active material (g) within the electrode,
and dV is the discharging potential range (V). 4  

The power density, which is the strength point of the SC,
can be
calculated from eq 5,
where E is the energy density and P is the power density. 5  

In order to investigate the charge storage mechanism, the
CV can
be investigated using eq 6.14,39 By plotting log i versus
log v, one can get the slope “b”, which relates the current to the charge transfer mechanism
via Tafel’s equation and can have values of either b = 0.5 corresponding to faradic intercalation mechanism,
or b = 1.0 corresponding to EDL capacitive mechanism.14,39 In this work, i is taken at V =
0 V. 6  

Using eq 7,14,39 one can expect that current response at a fixed potential is a combination
of two separate mechanisms, the capacitive resulting current (k1v) and the diffusion-controlled
mechanism resulting current (k2v1/2), where k1 and k2 are obtained from the slope and intercept
of the v–1/2 versus i(V)/v1/2 plot, respectively,
where v is the scan rate in mV/s and i(v) is the current in mA “here taken at V = 0 V”. Solving the equation will give the contributions
of current, either double-layer or diffusion-controlled, at a specific
potential and specific scan rate.14,39 7  

To further investigate the charge storage
mechanism effect on the
total capacitance, we used Trasatti’s method.16 This method assumes that at a scan rate of 0 mV/s, the
charges are accessible to the surface and inner regions of the electrode,
which corresponds to the total capacitance, whereas at a scan rate
of ∞, the charges are only related to the outer surface and
the related capacitance is due to the EDL capacitance mechanism. Thus,
when plotting specific capacitance versus the inverse of the square
root of the scan rate (mV/s), one can get the EDL capacitance and
when plotting the inverse of the specific capacitance versus the square
root of the scan rate (mV/s), one can get the total capacitance.14,40
