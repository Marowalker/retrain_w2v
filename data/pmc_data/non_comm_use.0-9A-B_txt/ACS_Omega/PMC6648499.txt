Researchers have
begun to use DNA molecules as an efficient template
for arrangement of multiple functionalized nanomaterials for specific
target applications. In this research, we demonstrated a simple process
to co-dope synthetic DNA nanostructures (by a substrate-assisted growth
method) and natural salmon DNA thin films (by a drop-casting method)
with divalent metal ions (M2+, e.g., Co2+ and
Cu2+) and trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln3+, e.g.,
Tb3+ and Eu3+). To identify the relationship
among the DNA and dopant ions, DNA nanostructures were constructed
while varying the Ln3+ concentration ([Ln3+])
at a fixed [M2+] with ion combinations of Co2+–Tb3+, Co2+–Eu3+,
Cu2+–Tb3+, and Cu2+–Eu3+. Accordingly, we were able to estimate the critical [Ln3+] (named the optimum [Ln3+], [Ln3+]O) at a given [M2+] in the DNA nanostructures that
corresponds to the phase change of the DNA nanostructures from crystalline
to amorphous. The phase of the DNA nanostructures stayed crystalline
up to [Tb3+]O ≡ 0.4 mM and [Eu3+]O ≡ 0.4 mM for Co2+ ([Tb3+]O ≡ 0.6 mM and [Eu3+]O ≡
0.6 mM for Cu2+) and then changed to amorphous above 0.4
mM (0.6 mM). Consequently, phase diagrams of the four combinations
of dopant ion pairs were created by analyzing the DNA lattice phases
at given [M2+] and [Ln3+]. Interestingly, we
observed extrema values of the measured physical quantities of DNA
thin films near [Ln3+]O, where the maximum current,
photoluminescence peak intensity, and minimum absorbance were obtained.
M2+- and Ln3+-multidoped DNA nanostructures
and DNA thin films may be utilized in the development of useful optoelectronic
devices or sensors because of enhancement and contribution of multiple
functionalities provided by M2+ and Ln3+.

Introduction
DNA molecules have
been widely explored as useful building materials
because of their intrinsic characteristics, for example, base sequence
design capability, self-assembly predicted by complementary binding,
and simple adaptability with various functionalized materials. Various
dimensional structures made of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides have
been constructed with precise control of size, shape, and pattern.1−9 DNA structures can serve as effective building platforms for arrangement
of various nanomaterials to be used in specific target applications
such as optoelectric devices, chemical sensors, drug delivery, and
biocomputing.10−14 DNA can be functionalized with various materials such as proteins,
drugs, metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles, carbon-based materials,
fluorescence dye molecules, and metal and lanthanide ions.15−26 Similarly, natural DNA such as lambda and salmon DNA (SDNA) has
also been used in the fields of biology, medicine, and bionanotechnology.27,28 Such DNA can be easily obtained in large quantities at a relatively
low cost, and these molecules can be easily incorporated with various
functionalized nanomaterials.

DNA structures embedded with individual
nanomaterials such as quantum
dots, gold nanoparticles, cobalt ions, and doxorubicin were fabricated,
and their chemical, physical, and biological properties have been
reported. However, there are certain limitations to construction of
multiple function-embedded DNA complexes containing various types
of nanomaterials because of difficulties in estimating appropriate
amounts of the nanomaterials at a given DNA concentration. Consequently,
DNA structures with optimum concentrations of nanomaterials are expected
to show drastic enhancements of specific physical characteristics
for further applications.29 Among functionalized
materials, metal ions (M2+) and lanthanide ions (Ln3+), which have unique physical characteristics, especially
with regard to electromagnetism and photonics, have been considered
useful dopants in DNA molecules because of their easy preparation,
ion species variety, and efficient functionality enhancement. To construct
multifunctional devices or sensors, methodology development of construction
techniques and systematic study of characterization of DNA complexes
with multiple dopant ions are needed.

Herein, we developed a
methodology to construct M2+ (e.g.,
cobalt ion Co2+ and copper ion Cu2+ for electrical
enhancement) and Ln3+ (e.g., terbium ion Tb3+ and europium ion Eu3+ for optical improvement) co-doped
double-crossover DNA (DX-DNA) nanostructures (grown on a given substrate)
and SDNA thin films (prepared via drop-casting). In addition, we evaluated
their topological (analyzing phase transition), electrical (current–voltage
(I–V) measurements), and
optical [absorbance and photoluminescence (PL)] characteristics. To
investigate the significances of the physical characteristics, DNA
thin films with 4 different combinations of M2+ and Ln3+ dopants (i.e., Co2+–Tb3+, Co2+–Eu3+, Cu2+–Tb3+, and Cu2+–Eu3+) were evaluated to determine
the optimum Ln3+ concentration ([Ln3+]O) at a given M2+ concentration ([M2+]) through
examination of phase diagrams obtained by theoretical analysis and
experiments.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 illustrates
the preparation and physical characterization of M2+- and
Ln3+-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures and SDNA thin films.
We used 4 combinations of M2+ and Ln3+ mixtures,
that is, Co2+–Tb3+, Co2+–Eu3+, Cu2+–Tb3+, and Cu2+–Eu3+. To fabricate co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures,
separate DX-DNA oligonucleotides with an O2 plasma-cleaned
substrate and appropriate amounts of M2+ and Ln3+ were mixed in a test tube and annealed from 95 to 25 °C. Similarly,
SDNA thin films were formed by drop-casting of a SDNA solution containing
M2+ and Ln3+. Four distinct physical measurements
were carried out to evaluate the intrinsic properties of the samples.
DX-DNA nanostructures with a combination of M2+ and Ln3+ grown on a substrate were used for atomic force microscope
(AFM) measurements to identify the phase change from crystalline to
amorphous. Current measurements of the co-doped SDNA thin films were
used to evaluate the electric properties. The absorbance was measured
to analyze the optical characteristics, and PL was utilized to determine
the luminescence.

DX-DNA nanostructures doped with
either M2+ or Ln3+ were constructed, and their
structural behavior was evaluated
at various [M2+] or [Ln3+]. Interestingly, phase
changes of the DX-DNA nanostructures from crystalline to amorphous
occurred above a certain ion concentration (referred to as the optimum
concentration, i.e., [M2+]O,S or [Ln3+]O,S, where S stands for single-ion doping), and extrema
values of the physical quantities (e.g., maximum current at [M2+]O,S and minimum absorbance at [Ln3+]O,S) were obtained at [M2+]O,S or
[Ln3+]O,S. The measured [Co2+]O,S, [Cu2+]O,S, [Tb3+]O,S, and [Eu3+]O,S were 1.0, 6.0, 1.0,
and 1.0 mM, respectively22−24 (the yellow dots in Figure 2 indicate [Co2+]O,S, [Cu2+]O,S, [Tb3+]O,S, and [Eu3+]O,S).

and corresponding AFM images of M2+-
and Ln3+-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures. (a) Phase diagram
of Co2+- and Tb3+-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures
with representative AFM images. Phase change from crystalline (red
circle) to amorphous (red cross) occurred after [Tb3+]O (optimum concentration) of 0.4 mM. Here, the yellow dots
in the diagram indicate the optimum concentration of single doping.
For clarity, the boundary and region of the crystalline phase are
displayed as a solid red line and light-blue shaded region, respectively.
The solid black line is the expected phase slope. In the AFM images
(scan size of 1 μm × 1 μm), the white dotted lines
represented lattice domain, and the insets (100 nm × 100 nm)
are reconstructed images after fast FFT. Periodic DX-DNA motifs are
visible in the crystalline phase, but no periodicity is observed in
the amorphous phase. (b) Phase diagram of Co2+- and Eu3+-doped DX-DNA nanostructures with representative AFM images.

nanostructures with representative AFM images. (d) Phase diagram of
Cu2+- and Eu3+-doped DX-DNA nanostructures with

In this study, M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped
DX-DNA
nanostructures were constructed at a fixed [M2+] while
varying [Ln3+]. Analysis of AFM images provided [Ln3+]O for co-doping, succeeded by achievement of
the phase diagram (a graphical illustration of the crystalline and
amorphous phases of M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped DX-DNA
nanostructures). DX-DNA nanostructures with M2+ and Ln3+ dopants possess the inherent unique properties of each species
of M2+ and Ln3+. Consequently, DX-DNA nanostructures
with multiple functionalities can be achieved easily by embedding
combinations of M2+ and Ln3+, which is benificial
than single doping.

The crystalline and amorphous domains with
specific pairs of M2+ and Ln3+ co-doped DX-DNA
nanostructures followed
relationships between [M2+] and [Ln3+], that
is,  and , respectively. The analytically obtained
expected line (shown as a black solid line) in the phase diagram of
co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures separates the crystalline and amorphous
phases, as shown in Figure 2. Here, the ratio of [M2+]O,S to [Ln3+]O,S indicates the numerical value of the slope
of the expected (=theoretical) line. For instance, the slope of Co2+ and Tb3+ (Cu2+ and Tb3+) co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures was [Co2+]O,S/[Tb3+]O,S = 1 ([Cu2+]O,S/[Tb3+]O,S = 6), which indicates identical
(different) optimum ion concentrations.

Figure 2 shows the
phase diagrams of the 4 combinations of M2+ and Ln3+ (i.e., Co2+–Tb3+, Co2+–Eu3+, Cu2+–Tb3+,
and Cu2+–Eu3+)-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures
with typical AFM images. The phases (crystalline and amorphous) of
the DX-DNA nanostructures were controlled by varying [Tb3+] and [Eu3+] (from 0.2 to 1.0 mM at an increment of 0.2
mM) at a fixed [Co2+] of 0.5 mM (here, we labeled DX-DNA
nanostructures with [Co2+] of X mM and
[Tb3+] of Y mM as Co X + Tb Y). The phase transition occurred from crystalline
(up to [Tb3+]O ≡ 0.4 mM and [Eu3+]O ≡ 0.4 mM, the optimum concentrations of Tb3+ and Eu3+, respectively) to amorphous (above 0.4
mM). For clarity, the boundary and region of the crystalline phase
are indicated by a red solid line and light-blue shaded area, respectively.
Similarly, the phase change of DX-DNA nanostructures with varying
either [Tb3+] or [Eu3+] at a fixed [Cu2+] of 3.0 mM occurred at 0.6 mM, which correspond to the optimum concentrations
of each ion, that is, [Tb3+]O and [Eu3+]O. Although a small number of sample sets (5 sets of
each M2+ and Ln3+ combination) were analyzed,
the experimental values agree well with the expected results. Here,
the difference of [Ln3+]O between the expected
and experimental values (i.e., |[Ln3+]O,expected – [Ln3+]O,experimental|) was only 0.1
mM [Ln3+] in all cases.

The light-blue-shaded and
white regions shown in the phase diagram
indicate the crystalline and amorphous domains of the M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures, respectively.
The crystal domains of DX-DNA nanostructures were indicated by the
white dotted lines in the AFM images. The insets in the images containing
noise-filtered reconstructed images constructed by fast Fourier-transformation
(FFT) indicate the periodicities of the DX motifs in the DNA nanostructures
(crystalline phase). The periodic arrays of the DX motifs did not
appear in the amorphous phase (additional AFM images are shown in
Figure S2 in Supporting Information). Becasue
of improper binding of excess Ln3+, deformation of DX-DNA
nanostructures (amorphous phase) occurred in the presence of excess
Ln3+ (=[Ln3+] – [Ln3+]O) at a fixed [M2+].

To enhance the reproducibility
of the experimental data and reduce
the buffer influence of DNA structures, SDNA thin films were introduced,
which are easily fabricated at a low cost. During preparation of a
co-doped SDNA thin film, aggregation of the SDNA duplex started to
occur above [Ln3+]O at a fixed [M2+] in solution. Although noticeable precipitation was observed at
relatively higher [Ln3+] (roughly 3 times higher [Ln3+] than [Ln3+]O at a fixed [M2+] or above) because of the excess of Ln3+ in the presence
of M2+, the minute aggregation of SDNA in solution did
not influence the experimental measurements (i.e., I–V, absorbance, and PL) because our measurements
were performed with M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA
thin films below and near [Ln3+]O at a fixed
[M2+].

Figure 3 shows the I–V characteristics
of SDNA thin
films without Ln3+ and at various [Ln3+] at
fixed [M2+]. I, which is one of the most
fundamental physical characteristics, can provide the overall electrical
behavior of a sample through controlling the applied V. Each sample with a different combination and concentration of dopant
ions was evaluated by sweeping the input V from −3
to 3 V. Interestingly, we noticed I offsets at 0
V, which may be caused by charge trapping and the negatively charged
nature of DNA molecules.25 The SDNA thin
films with different [Ln3+] (either [Tb3+] or
[Eu3+] from 0.2 to 1.0 mM) at a fixed [M2+]
(either [Co2+] = 0.5 mM or [Cu2+] = 3.0 mM)
showed increasing I up to a certain critical [Ln3+] at a fixed [M2+] and then decreased as [Ln3+] was further increased. While varying [Tb3+]
([Eu3+]) with [Co2+] = 0.5 mM, the maximum I occurred at a [Tb3+] of 0.8 mM ([Eu3+] = 0.4 mM) because of the maximum capability of appropriate coordination
of Tb3+ (Eu3+) and Co2+ on DNA base-pairing
sites and negatively charged phosphate backbones at a given [SDNA].
Similarly, for [Tb3+] ([Eu3+]) at [Cu2+] = 3.0 mM, the maximum I occurred at a [Tb3+] of 0.2 mM ([Eu3+] = 0.6 mM). Above such critical
concentrations, I tended to decrease because of inappropriate
and nondesignated coordination of excess Ln3+ into the
DNA molecules. Although [Tb3+] in the SDNA thin films at
a fixed [M2+] showing the maximum I differed
slightly from the [Tb3+]O obtained from the
phase analysis of the co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures, the differences
of critical [Eu3+] with the maximum I and
[Eu3+]O values are compatible.

Figure 3 Current–voltage
(I–V) measurements of SDNA
thin films without Ln3+ and at
given [Ln3+] and [M2+]. (a) Current of Tb3+-doped SDNA thin films at a given [Co2+]. At a
fixed [Co2+] of 0.5 mM (named as Co 0.5), [Tb3+] was changed to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 mM (Tb 0.2, Tb 0.4,
Tb 0.6, Tb 0.8, and Tb 1.0, respectively). (b) Current of Eu3+-doped SDNA thin films at a given [Co2+]. (c) Current
of Tb3+-doped SDNA thin films at a fixed [Cu2+]. At a fixed [Cu2+] of 3.0 mM, [Tb3+] was
changed. (d) Current of Eu3+-doped SDNA thin films at a
given [Cu2+]. Here, the insets were the resistance as a
function of [Ln3+] obtained at fixed voltages of 1, 2,
and 3 V.

The resistances (R, obtained by Ohm’s law)
of M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA thin films as
a function of [Ln3+] based on observed I–V data are shown in the insets in Figure 3. As expected, R decreased until a critical [Ln3+] and then
increased as [Ln3+] was further increased (opposite trend
as I). A noticeable reduction of R at a critical [Ln3+] in the SDNA thin film was observed
for most of the samples at a fixed [M2+] compared to pristine
SDNA. Interestingly, R of M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA thin films revealed significantly lower R of ∼MΩ range than those from single M2+- or Ln3+-doping, whose R was
within the GΩ range.23,30 The minimum R obtained at a [Eu3+] of 0.4 mM and a [Eu3+] of 0.6 mM at fixed [Co2+] and [Cu2+] were roughly 2.0 and 14 MΩ at a V of 3 V,
respectively. These critical concentrations were matched to [Eu3+]O, resulting in the phase diagrams shown in Figure 2. The critical concentrations
acquired from R for [Tb3+] at a fixed
[Co2+] and [Tb3+] at a fixed [Cu2+] were 0.8 and 0.2 mM, respectively. These critical concentrations
were slightly different from [Tb3+]O (0.4 mM
at a fixed [Co2+] and 0.6 mM at a fixed [Cu2+]) obtained from the phase diagrams.

Figure 4 shows the
absorbance spectra used to reveal the interactions between DNA molecules
and dopant ions of M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA
thin films. The Co2+–Tb3+, Co2+–Eu3+, Cu2+–Tb3+,
and Cu2+–Eu3+ co-doped SDNA thin films
showed a similar trend in that the intensity at a wavelength of 260
nm (major characteristic peak produced from DNA) was quenched until
a certain critical concentration and then increased as [Ln3+] was further increased. Relatively broader absorbance peaks were
observed with higher concentrations of dopant ions compared to pristine
SDNA. The insets in Figure 4 shows the intensity changes of absorbances at 260 nm as a
function of [Ln3+]. When varying [Tb3+] ([Eu3+]) at a fixed [Co2+] of 0.5 mM, the minimum absorbance
intensity was observed at [Tb3+] = 0.4 mM ([Eu3+] = 0.4 mM) because of transfer of photon energy between dopant ions
and DNA, which results in intensity quenching. The appreciable decrease
in absorption peak intensity reveals that the dopant ions could be
specifically intercalated in DNA base-pairs and bound to the phosphate
backbone sites up to the critical concentration of dopant ions. Similarly,
for [Tb3+] ([Eu3+]) at a fixed [Cu2+] of 3.0 mM, the minimum intensity occurred at a [Tb3+] of 0.6 mM ([Eu3+] = 0.6 mM). These critical concentrations
determined from the absorbance were accidently matched to [Tb3+]O and [Eu3+]O acquired
from the phase analysis shown in Figure 2.

The PL emission and PL excitation (PLE) spectra
(Figure 5a,c) and Gaussian-fitted
PL
intensities and areas (Figure 5b,d) of Co2+- and Tb3+ (Eu3+)-co-doped SDNA thin films are shown in Figure 5 (PL spectra of Cu2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA are shown in Figure S4). PL and PLE spectra were obtained to study energy transfer among
SDNA and dopant ions. As shown in the insets in Figure 5, both Co2+–Tb3+ and Co2+–Eu3+ co-doped SDNA thin films
showed the same excitation wavelength (λex) of 290
nm at fixed emission wavelengths (λem) of 545 and
615 nm, respectively. Figure S3 in Supporting Information shows representative PLE spectra of Co2+–Tb3+ and Co2+–Eu3+ co-doped SDNA thin films at fixed λem values of
545 and 615 nm, respectively. DNA molecules absorbed photon energy
through excitation of electrons from the ground state to the single
state. Energy transfer then occurred within the singlet state through
the process of internal conversion. After internal conversion, electrons
from the singlet state in SDNA are relaxed to the triplet state in
co-doped SDNA by intersystem crossing, followed by relaxation from
the emissive state to the ground state, resulting in PL emission.

thin films. (a) PL spectra of SDNA thin films at given [Tb3+] and [Co2+]. The PLE spectrum at a characteristic emission
wavelength (λem) of 545 nm is shown in the inset.

intensities and areas with different [Eu3+] at fixed [Co2+] and λem.

Figure 5a
shows
the PL spectra of SDNA thin films with varying [Tb3+] at
a fixed [Co2+] of 0.5 mM. Major peaks were revealed around
486, 545, 586, and 621 nm, which result from the bound state of 5D4 to ground states of 7F6, 7F5,7F4, and 7F3, respectively. The intensity of the Tb3+ characteristic peak at 545 nm increased noticeably as [Tb3+] increased to the critical concentration of 0.6 mM. When [Tb3+] was higher than the critical concentration, cross-relaxation
occurred because of the excess amount of Tb3+, resulting
in quenching of the emission intensity. Similarly, the Gaussian-fitted
areas as a function of [Tb3+] showed similar behavior to
the emission peak intensity measured at 545 nm (Figure 5b). Figure 5c displays the PL spectra of Co2+- and Eu3+-co-doped SDNA thin films. Major peaks are observed at 590,
615, and 700 nm, which correspond to energy transfer from the bound
state of 5D0 to the ground states of 7F1, 7F2, and 7F3, respectively. The Co2+- and Eu3+-co-doped
SDNA thin films also showed a similar trend in which the intensity
of the major peak at 615 nm increased as [Eu3+] increased
to the critical concentration of 0.8 mM. As expected, the area of
the peak at 615 nm obtained from Gaussian fitting showed the same
trend as the PL intensities (Figure 5d).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized
a M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped DX-DNA nanostructures
via a substrate-assisted growth (SAG)
method and SDNA thin films on substrates by a drop-casting method
while varying the combination and concentrations of dopant ions. Phase
transition from 2D DX nanostructures to amorphous structures occurred
at critical concentrations. M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped
SDNA thin films showed increasing current up to the critical concentration
and decreased as the dopant ion concentration was further increased.
The same trend was observed for PL, whereas absorbance showed the
opposite behavior. The critical concentration for each combination
of dopant ions in SDNA thin films was well matched with the critical
concentration of DX-DNA nanostructures obtained from phase diagrams.
Tunable physical properties of M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped DNA structures by simply changing the concentrations of
dopant ions are crucial for further applications. By combining the
advantages of DNA structures serving as a template and dopant ions
possessing intrinsic characteristics, M2+- and Ln3+-multiple-doped DNA structures can be used in particular devices
and sensors such as transistors, flexible displays, organic light-emitting
diodes, and gas sensors.

Experimental Methods
To improve
the binding affinity
among charged DNA molecules and a substrate through electrostatic
interaction, a substrate (glass for the phase analysis and fused silica
for current, absorbance, and PL measurements) was treated with oxygen
(O2) plasma. An O2 plasma treatment (CUTE-1MP/R
Plasma processing system, Femto Science, Gyeonggi, Korea) was used
to introduce a silanol group on a given substrate. This functional
group changes the surface of a substrate from hydrophobic to hydrophilic,
which helps to achieve stable growth of DX-DNA nanostructures and
the formation of SDNA thin films with uniform thickness (Figure 1).

DX-DNA nanostructures
with metallic ion (M2+) and lanthanide ion (Ln3+) on a glass substrate (5 mm × 5 mm) were synthesized by a SAG
method. DX-DNA nanostructures are composed of two repeating DX motifs
each containing 4 strands with dimensions of 4.0 nm × 12.6 nm.
A 50 nM amount of individual DX strands is guaranteed to attain full
growth on a given substrate. Consequently, 8 different DX strands
(Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) were mixed with specific ions (CoCl2, Cu(NO3)2 for M2+ and Tb(NO3)3·6H2O, Eu(NO3)3·5H2O for Ln3+, Sigma-Aldrich,
USA) at the designated concentrations in the presence of a 1×
TAE/Mg2+ (40 mM Tris, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (pH 8.0), and 12.5 mM magnesium acetate) buffer solution. The
M2+ concentration ([M2+]) was fixed (0.5 mM
for Co2+ and 3 mM for Cu2+), whereas [Ln3+] was controlled from 0.2 to 1.0 mM with an increment of
0.2 mM. An O2 plasma-treated substrate was placed in a
test tube containing DX-DNA strands with an appropriate concentration
of ions (total volume of 250 μL). A sample test tube was then
placed in a Styrofoam box containing 2 L of boiled water and slowly
cooled from 95 to 25 °C for hybridization (Figures 1, 2, and S1, Tables
S1, and S2 in Supporting Information).

Next, 0.1 g of SDNA (Marine Salmon P/no. DPO 1405787, GEM Corporation,
Shiga, Japan) dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water was prepared for
construction of the SDNA thin film. The SNDA solution was kept on
a magnetic stirrer at 800 rpm for 10 h at room temperature to achieve
a homogeneous 1 wt % SDNA solution. To fabricate the M2+ and Ln3+ co-doped SDNA thin film, a 0.5 wt % SDNA solution
was mixed with the four different sets of [M2+] and [Ln3+]. The 20 μL of SDNA solution with appropriate [M2+] and [Ln3+] was drop-cast on a given substrate
and left overnight. The final thickness and the average root mean
square displacement of the ion co-doped SDNA thin film was ∼2
μm and ∼4 nm, respectively (Figure 1).

Glass with DX-DNA nanostructures
was attached on a metal puck for
AFM imaging. Then, 30 and 20 μL of 1× TAE/Mg2+ buffer was added onto the substrate and silicon nitride AFM tip
(NP-S10, Veeco Inc., USA), respectively. AFM measurements were carried
out by a multimode nanoscope (Veeco Inc., USA) in fluid-tapping mode
(Figures 1, 2, and S2 in Supporting Information).

To evaluate the electrical characteristics, two-probe measurements
(silver contacts with a channel gap of ∼1 mm) through the M2+- and Ln3+-co-doped SDNA thin film were conducted
using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200-SCS, Keithley Instruments
Inc., USA) (Figures 1 and 3).

UV–visible optical absorption
of the co-doped SDNA thin
film was examined to understand the interaction between the DNA and
ions. The spectrophotometer (Cary 5G, Varian, CA, USA) is composed
of light sources and detectors (Figures 1 and 4).

The
PL and PLE spectra of the co-doped SDNA thin film were performed
at an ambient condition using a Xe-arc lamp equipped fluorometer (FS-2,
Scinco, Seoul, Korea) with a power of 25 W. The PLE (PL) spectra were
attained at fixed wavelengths λem (λex) of 545 and 615 nm (297 nm) (Figures 1, 5, S3, and S4 in Supporting Information).
