Active
colloidal particles regularly interact with surfaces in
applications ranging from microfluidics to sensing. Recent work has
revealed the complex nature of these surface interactions for active
particles. Herein, we summarize experiments and simulations that show
the impact of charged nanoparticles on the propulsion of an active
colloid near a boundary. Adding charged nanoparticles not only decreased
the average separation distance of a passive colloid because of depletion
attraction as expected but also decreased the apparent propulsion
of a Janus colloid to near zero. Complementary agent-based simulations
considering the impact of hydrodynamics for active Janus colloids
were conducted in the range of separation distances inferred from
experiment. These simulations showed that propulsion speed decreased
monotonically with decreasing average separation distance. Although
the trend found in experiments and simulations was in qualitative
agreement, there was still a significant difference in the magnitude
of speed reduction. The quantitative difference was attributed to
the influence of charged nanoparticles on the conductivity of the
active particle suspension. Follow-up experiments delineating the
impact of depletion and conductivity showed that both contribute to
the reduction of speed for an active Janus particle. The experimental
and simulated data suggests that it is necessary to consider the synergistic
effects between various mechanisms influencing interactions experienced
by an active particle near a boundary.

1 Introduction
Micrometer-scale self-propelled
or active “colloidal”
particles that generate force to induce motion have the potential
as microscale cargo carriers, chemical sensors, and synthetic analogs
for micro- and macroscale biological entities.1−7 Active colloids generate sufficient force for motility through a
combination of a local break in symmetry and an environmental cue
that actuates motion.8,9 Propulsion can be generated by
a chemical reaction, light, magnetic, and electric fields.10−13 One such example is that of a patchy sphere comprising a native
particle with a metallic cap.14 The patchy
sphere is called a “Janus” particle when the cap covers
approximately ∼50% of the available surface area. Janus particle
caps typically have a nominal thickness of 5–30 nm that will
vary across the contour of the particle as a consequence of the fabrication
process,15 which can also be adjusted to
tune the cap size and shape.16−18 Janus particles consisting of
an arbitrary native particle and a platinum cap propel in the presence
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) because of a decomposition
reaction on the platinum cap. Reactants and products form a gradient
in solute on the length scale of the particle that induces self-diffusiophoretic
motion.19 Propulsion speed increases with
fuel concentration, ranging from ∼0.1 to 10 μm/s. Graphite-capped
particles are the second example of a Janus particle that propels
in response to a cue.10 Local demixing
of the solvent in the vicinity of the graphite cap occurs when the
particle is heated via illumination by a focused light source at the
wavelength of absorption for graphite around 532 nm. The latter system
has the advantage of being reversible, yet requires an external source
of actuation. Given that active Janus particles move as a consequence
of “self-generated” motion, these synthetic systems
offer an intriguing option for studying phenomena typically found
in biology, for instance, swarming, clustering, or interaction with
nearby surfaces.

Just like “passive” colloids,
active colloids regularly
interact with surfaces,20 via both conservative
(i.e., path-independent) and nonconservative (i.e., path-dependent)
interactions. Conservative interactions typically arise from physiochemical
properties of the fluid, whereas nonconservative interactions are
hydrodynamic in nature. Conservative surface interactions may depend
on system properties such as the salinity, particle charge, or number
concentration of dispersed solids. Nonconservative interactions typically
depend on the inherent geometry of the system, such as particle confinement
or shape. The combination of these forces is known to play a critical
role in the dynamics of passive particles near boundaries, especially
when multiple particles are being considered.21 More recently, surface interactions have been elucidated for active
particles near boundaries, where additional consideration such as
that of disturbances to local fuel concentration by the nearby boundary
was considered.20,22−26 One recent example showed that the rotational diffusion
of a platinum-capped Janus particle was quenched near a boundary,
subsequently steering the propulsion of the particle along a corner
because of hydrodynamic quenching.27 This
work highlights a hydrodynamic strategy for steering active colloids,
which will be necessary to realize the full potential of active systems
for applications.

This paper summarizes experiments and simulations
of an active
particle near a boundary. Micrometer-scale Janus particles with platinum
caps in the presence of H2O2 were imaged and
tracked, and the apparent propulsion speed was calculated from the
mean-squared displacement (MSD) in the presence and absence of negatively
charged nanoparticles. Nominally, 5 μm diameter Janus particles
near a boundary propelled at speeds from 0.1 to 2 μm/s in response
to H2O2 but had a propulsion speed approaching
0 μm/s following the addition of strongly charged 20 nm particles.
A separate set of experiments found that the average apparent separation
distance of passive colloidal particles in the absence of H2O2, but in the presence of nanoparticles, was reduced
to <100 nm. Quasi-two-dimensional (2D) agent-based simulations
were conducted to infer the change in propulsion speed from hydrodynamics
in response to this apparent change in separation distance. Simulations
showed that the speed was reduced as a consequence of a change in
separation distance, but the magnitude of the reduction was insufficient
to account for experimental observations. Further measurements showed
that the conductivity of the suspensions increased upon the addition
of the nanoparticle depletants. Increasing the conductivity of the
fluid has been shown to decrease the propulsion speed of active particles
under the influence of self-electrophoresis.28 Follow-up measurements controlling for the influence of charge in
a depletant system showed that both fluid conductivity and depletion
attraction were relevant to slowing the propulsion speed of active
Janus particles. Observations from simulations and experiments summarized
herein demonstrate the importance of considering both conservative
and nonconservative surface interactions experienced by an active
colloid near a boundary, in addition to any fluid constituents that
may impact the propulsion mechanism.

2 Theory
2.1 Dynamics of a Janus Particle Near a Boundary
Consider
a single spherical particle as shown in Figure 1. The particle has radius a and is separated a distance h from the
nearby boundary. The particle experiences random fluctuations in both
position (x, y, z) and orientation (θ, ϕ) because of collisions between
it and neighboring solvent molecules (i.e., Brownian motion). The
particle is sampling positions in a potential energy well comprising
conservative forces that are a consequence of the chemistry or topology
of the particle and surface. The particle remains mobile because of
the strong electrostatic repulsion between it and the neighboring
boundary. In addition to conservative interactions, the particle experiences
nonconservative hydrodynamic forces and torques in response to both
translational and rotational motion, respectively.29 The work described herein is primarily concerned with motion
in the xy-plane. The drag in response to the translational
motion in the xy-plane is the wall-corrected Stokes
drag force 1   2  where f∞ is the linear quasi-steady
Stokes drag coefficient, η is the
fluid viscosity, qxy(δ)
is the wall correction factor in the xy-plane, x is the position vector, and δ = h/a. Similarly, the drag in response to rotational
motion in the relevant rotational axis is 3   4  where f∞r is the rotational drag coefficient for a particle far
from the boundary, dω/dt is the rotational
rate, and qθ (δ) is the wall
correction factor for θ rotation. Equations 1–4 are for the
quasi-steady translation or rotation of a sphere near a boundary.
These expressions are appropriate when both the Reynolds (vaρf/η) and the product of the Stokes
numbers (a2ρf/Tη) are small, where T is the characteristic
time scale of the flow. Considering the small size of a typical particle
(∼1–10 μm) and the self-propelled velocity typically
encountered in experiments (∼0.1–5 μm/s), both
of these dimensionless numbers are small. These quantities are similar
to those of a swimming bacterium such as Escherichia
coli, which has been successfully studied with models
in the low Reynolds number regime by the present authors among others.30−32 The main advantage to this approach is that in place of the nonlinear
Navier–Stokes equations one can model the fluid and interaction
with surrounding particles using a linear Stokes equation.

Figure 1 Janus particle
with radius a and separation distance h. A micrometer-scale Janus particle with a density not
matching that of the solvent will settle to the bottom boundary of
a fluid cell. The particle will experience Brownian fluctuations in
position (x, y, z). Experiments and simulations described herein track and infer speed
from motion in the xy-plane. Once near the boundary,
the particle will have an instantaneous separation distance h that is characterized with a most probable hm or average separation distance hAVG. Upon the addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to a solution, the particle will move along a deterministic
path in the xy-plane.

2.2 Agent-Based Modeling
We developed
a differential-equation-based model derived from the balance of forces
and torques on each platinum-capped particle. The key feature is that
the model represents each Janus particle as a point force dipole.
While the Janus particles themselves are propelled by a chemical reaction,
the net result of motion is the same as a self-propelled particle
such as a swimming bacterium beating its flagella to propel through
the fluid. Here, the Janus cells are spheres, whereas typically bacteria
are elliptical in shape quantified by the Bretherton constant (B = 0/1 for sphere/needles). However, the propulsion mechanism
for any shape can be modeled as a point force dipole where the drag
force on the body is balanced by the propulsion force. The shape plays
a greater role in the dynamics of the orientation of a cell than in
the translational velocity.

The point dipole model tracks the
motion of a particle’s center of mass and orientation, which
are both crucial for understanding the dynamics at the microscale.
Extensive work using models of this form has successfully captured
the experimental observation for isolated and collective bacterial
motion.30,33−36 In particular, the streamlines
generated by the model are qualitatively the same as the recent experimental
observation everywhere but within a half-particle length of the cell.37 This discrepancy only becomes relevant at high
concentrations or locally dense regions of active particles. To account
for this, an excluded volume force is implemented modeling soft collisions
at the microscale. A distinct advantage of using this form is the
simple nature of the numerical simulations that allow for tracking
many particles in a modest amount of computational time. The efficiency
comes from an explicit analytical solution to the fluid equation describing
the hydrodynamic velocity field generated by each Janus particle.

In particular, we consider N point particles representing
the Janus cells indexed from i = 1, ...,N. The model will account for the dynamics of the center of mass  and orientation , a unit vector. Given the typical movement
speed of the Janus particles (∼0.1–5 μm/s) and
the typical size (2.5–5 μm), the fluid is in the low
Reynolds number regime. This allows the fluid to be modeled as a linear
Stokes equation avoiding the complexity of solving the full Navier–Stokes
equations. As in the experimental setup, we consider a thin-film model
where the length component in the z-direction is
much less than in the xy-directions tangent to the
bottom surface. Previous work derived an explicit analytical solution
for the point dipole flow in a thin film, which is taken as the limit
of two oppositely oriented force monopoles.31,38 The primary difference between the thin-film fluid velocity and
the free space is the decay rate as a function of separation distance.
The former decays as the inverse cube of the distance, while the latter
decays as the inverse square.

We assume for the model that the
particles are all at the same
height away from the boundary h, allowing for the
treatment of the system as if it were quasi-2D. Therefore, the expression
used for the fluid velocity at  time t generated by a
Janus particle at the origin with orientation di is given by 5  where U0 = ζηl2v0 > 0 is the
size
of the cell dipole moment derived from the Stokes drag law, where
ζ is a shape coefficient, which is 6π for spheres using
the classic Stokes drag law, η is the ambient fluid viscosity, v0 is the isolated movement speed of a Janus
particle, and l is the particle diameter.31 Also, a + h is the height of the center of mass above the bottom surface. The
sum is a result of being in a semidilute regime where the total N body hydrodynamic interactions on a given particle are
the sum of pairwise flows generated by each other active particle
on that particle’s location in the domain. Since this is a
low Reynolds number fluid, the dynamics will be overdamped resulting
in the velocity being proportional to force (e.g., Stokes drag law).
Thus, from the balance of forces and torques on each Janus particle,
we have 6   7  The first term in the translational velocity
equation represents the self-propulsion of each Janus particle in
the direction it is orientated. The isolated propulsion speed in the
absence of other particles, but in the presence of the chemical fuel,
is v0. In the most general case, this
can be set individually for each particle and be time-dependent, but
in the present simulations, we assume that it is constant and taken
from our experimental observations of a Janus particle in infinite
dilution (isolation). The second term represents the advection of
the Janus particle by the fluid flow created by all of the other cells
translating and is given explicitly in eq 5. The third term F is the short-range
purely repulsive force modeled by a Yukawa potential (e.g., see Drescher
et al.37 or for similar results use a truncated
Lennard–Jones potential39). This
term is designed to repel all particles within one particle length
to account for the excluded volume occupied by the Janus particle
surrounding its center of mass. The fourth term in eq 6 represents translational diffusion
and is modeled as a white noise process and is formally represented
as the derivative of a Weiner process. The strength of the translational
diffusion is given by Dt. The coefficient
as defined in (6) represents the modified drag force exhibited on
the translating Janus particle due to the effects of the boundary
on the particles. By using these hinderance terms, we can simulate
the three-dimensional thin-film domain with a two-dimensional model.

From the balance of torques on each particle, we arrive at eq 7 governing the dynamics
of the orientation of the ith particle. The first
term is derived from Jeffery’s equations40 and allows the point dipoles to interact with the fluid
as if they were prolate ellipsoids. Only the contribution to orientation
dynamics from the local vorticity remains for spherical particles.
Traditionally, there is an additional term due to the rate of strain,
but this term is proportional to the Bretherton constant, which is
zero for spheres. The last term represents rotational diffusion and
is also modeled as a white noise process with strength Dθ. The rotational hinderance capturing the orientation
drag, qθ, slows the angular velocity
of each Janus particle as a function of the distance from the boundary.

The simulations were run with N = 5 particles
mimicking a semidilute regime, but the model can account for any number.
A computational domain of size L × L, where L = 75l is 75 times the
size on an individual particle, was employed. The concentration can
be measured as an effective area fraction ρ = Nπl2/4L2, and simulation concentrations were chosen to match experimental
densities. In addition, the simulations were performed with periodic
boundary conditions to eliminate any finite size effects associated
with the boundaries in the x and y directions. Parameters used in the simulation can be found in Table 1 below.

3 Methods
3.1 Fabricating Janus Particles
Molecular
probe polystyrene sulfate latex beads with nominally 5 μm diameter
were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Lot #1964358). The suspension
of polystyrene spheres was washed with ultrapure water via ultrasonication
and transferred to ethanol for suspension prior to monolayer fabrication.
Spin coating was used to prepare a monolayer of the native polystyrene
spheres on a 20 x 20 mm silicon wafer that was made hydrophilic using
a plasma cleaner (PDC 32G). Approximately 15 μL of solution
was dispersed onto each of the 20 x 20 mm silicon wafers positioned
inside the spin coater. The suspension drop was spun down first for
20 s at 300 rpm and then for 40 s at 3000 rpm.

For the platinum
deposition process, the silicon wafers were attached and secured onto
prelabeled microscope slides using a high-temperature adhesive tape.
The platinum vapor deposition on the 2D close-packed colloidal monolayer
was performed inside a vacuum with an angle of incidence θ =
0° (the stationary substrate is positioned parallel to the ground
and perpendicular to the platinum vapor). The chamber housing the
e-beam evaporator was pumped to reach pressures below 10–5 Pa. Platinum was deposited to a nominal thickness of 20 nm at a
rate of 0.25 Å/s. Finally, Janus particles were redispersed by
first submerging the wafers in ultrapure water using a 50 mL centrifuge
tube. The tubes were sonicated for at least 45 min to ensure maximum
desorption of particles. The suspension containing the Janus particles
was then centrifuged for ∼5 min at 4000 rpm, and the supernatant
was removed. The process was repeated twice, and the finally collected
volume was concentrated into a 1 mL suspension consisting of Janus
particles and ultrapure water. Nominally 20 nm diameter sulfate-modified
polystyrene particles obtained from Life Technologies (Lot #1677600)
were utilized for some experiments. These nanoparticles had electrophoretic
mobility of −3.65 ± 0.11 μm cm/(V s). The nanoparticle
suspension was sonicated for 20 min followed by vortex-mixing at 4000
rpm for 2 min prior to addition to the sample contained in the fluid
cell. Finally, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, Alfa Aesar, Lot #1019473)
with a molecular weight MW = 6000 was used as received for the follow-up
control experiments with uncharged depletants.

3.2 Preparation
of Fluid Cell and Image Collection
The fluid cell was installed
onto a prewashed and sonicated microscope
slide using a Secure-Seal spacer (Lot #1870350) with a 9 mm diameter
and a 0.12 mm depth and coverslip on top. The suspension of Janus
particles was pipetted into the fluid cell with the appropriate amount
of H2O2 for each experimental condition. Janus
particle concentration was set at infinite dilution (<10 particles
in ROI) near a boundary to minimize the effects of surface interactions
that could arise between neighboring particles. The suspension containing
Janus particles was first pipetted into the cell, followed by the
addition of a specified volume of nanoparticle suspension. Finally,
H2O2 was pipetted into the fluid cell and immediately
closed with a coverslip to minimize evaporation.

Images were
collected and analyzed at a frame rate of between 2.6 and 16.2 frames
per second of an infinitely dilute suspension of particles settled
near a boundary. A total of 81 videos at various conditions were obtained,
with the majority containing >1000 frames or more and between 1
and
5 particles in the region of interest for the entire video. The standard
deviation of multiple particles is reported herein as error bars.
Image stacks were initially filtered in Fiji (https://fiji.sc/), particles were subsequently
identified and tracked, and trajectories were calculated from an existing
algorithm executed in MATLAB.41,42 The MSD ⟨r2⟩ was calculated from these trajectories.
In the absence of H2O2, the MSD curve was fit
with a linear relationship (see eq 8), whereas in the presence of H2O2, the MSD was fit with the expression for a self-propelled particle
at short times when compared to that at rotational diffusion time
1/Dr ∼ 85 s (see eq 9)43 8   9  All experimental data was fit for τ
< 5 s, which satisfies the short-time criteria for eq 9. Fits reported herein were from
a single-parameter fit in each scenario. The fit parameter was D0 in eq 8 for experiments not containing H2O2, while the fit parameter was vs in eq 9 for experiments containing
H2O2, with D0 fixed
at a value obtained from previous measurements. Note that in addition
to the single-parameter fit in the latter case with H2O2, we also conducted a two-parameter fit for both D0 and vs. Differences in the
value of vs between the two fits were
typically <10%.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Propulsion of Janus Particles
The
speed response of Janus particles with a platinum cap was measured
as a function of H2O2 concentration. The apparent
speed of the Janus particles increased roughly linearly with increasing
peroxide concentration (see Figure 2). Note the large error bars associated with these
data. The origin of error arises from multiple factors, including
particle fabrication and the nature of the experiment itself. A platinum
cap with 50% coverage, a Janus particle, will result when a monolayer
of particles is situated on a substrate normal to the deposition direction.
However, variations in cap thickness from particle to particle will
arise during fabrication because of multilayer regions or other departures
from a particle monolayer situated perpendicular to the deposition
source. Further, slight variations in particle size, inherent to our
particle sample, will alter the propulsion speed. The values of propulsion
speed reported here are systematically lower than those reported elsewhere,43 although that work utilized particles with significantly
smaller radii than those used herein (∼1.6 vs ∼2.5 μm).
Previous work has reported an inverse dependence of propulsion speed
on particle radius.44 Another factor contributing
to the error in these measurements is that deterministic motion from
propulsion is superimposed on Brownian fluctuations that are random.
The stochastic nature of these experiments produces some error intrinsic
to the measurement.

Figure 2 Apparent speed of Janus particles. The apparent speed
of Janus
particles increased linearly with increasing fuel concentration. We
chose to focus experiments for the remainder of the article on a fuel
concentration of 5% to not only drive sufficient deterministic motion
but also mitigate deleterious effects of bubbles.

Catalytic active Janus particles may produce macroscopic bubbles
at some conditions. Bubble generation was significant at conditions
where either the particle concentration or H2O2 concentration was large. A large particle concentration provided
a large area for the catalytic activity to produce significant amounts
of O2 as product. Whereas a large H2O2 concentration provides a large concentration of reactant to produce
a significant product. In either case, significant bubble production
was detrimental to image capture. In response to these concerns, experiments
described for the remainder of this article were conducted at conditions
that balanced these two deleterious effects, large error as compared
to speed and bubble generation. We chose to work at infinite dilution
and 5% H2O2 concentration because these conditions
resulted in active particles with a speed that was sufficiently large
to track, yet did not produce large quantities of macroscopic bubbles
detrimental to imaging.

4.2 Propulsion of Janus Particles
in the Presence
of Depletants
The addition of nonadsorbing nanoparticles
will act as depletants in a suspension of colloidal particles.45−47 Herein, negatively charged 20 nm particles were added to induce
a conservative depletion attraction between the Janus particles and
nearby boundary. Initial experiments measured the lateral diffusion
coefficient for Janus particles in the presence of depletants, but
the absence of H2O2. The volume fractions of
nanoparticles were ϕ = 0, 0.00059, and 0.0015. Note that even
in the absence of depletants, the diffusion coefficient was strongly
hindered by the nearby boundary (see Figure 3). The addition of depletants further decreased
the diffusion coefficient as a consequence of an attractive depletion
interaction between the Janus particle and boundary (see Figure 3). The average separation
distance hAVG was inferred from the relationship
between the diffusion coefficient and separation distance (see eqs 1 and 2). These data show that the average separation distance decreased
from hAVG = 211 nm at ϕ = 0 to hAVG < 100 nm upon the addition of depletants
ϕ = 0.00059 and ϕ = 0.0015. Note also a small increase
in average height at larger volume fractions. A reduction in the attractive
depletion force may occur at larger volume fractions as a consequence
of oscillatory or structural forces found in charged systems.47

Figure 3 Apparent diffusion coefficient of Janus particles as a
function
of depletant concentration. The diffusion coefficient at a depletant
volume fraction ϕ = 0 was hindered because the particles settle
to the bottom boundary under the influence of gravity. Following the
addition of depletants, Janus particles moved closer to the boundary
because of increased attractive interaction between the particle and
wall. The decrease in average separation distance was nonmonotonic,
which could result from structural forces that arise in suspensions
of strongly charged nanoparticles.47

Next, experiments were conducted to track the propulsion
of Janus
particles in the presence of nanoparticles and in 5% H2O2. The impact of adding nanoparticles was immediately
clear. The MSD from Janus particles suspended in 5% H2O2 and nanoparticles was smaller in magnitude and revealed a
linear dependence on lag time ∼τ. This departs from the
nonlinear dependence on lag time ∼τ2 observed
for experiments with Janus particles in the presence of H2O2 and absence of nanoparticles. Figure 4 shows a typical mean-squared displacement
for a Janus particle in 5% H2O2 in the presence
and absence of depletants.

Figure 4 Mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a Janus particle
in 5% H2O2 in the absence (open circles) and
presence (black
filled circles) of 20 nm nanoparticles. The MSD of a Janus particle
in the absence of 20 nm particles depended on the square of lag time,
while the MSD depended linearly on lag time following the addition
of the nanoparticles. The τ2 dependence indicated
propulsion (see eq 8),
while the τ indicated a purely Brownian motion (see eq 9).

The relationship between MSD and lag time transitioned from one
characteristic of an active particle (see eq 9) to one characteristic of a purely Brownian
particle (see eq 8).
Apparent propulsion speed was calculated from these experiments. As
gleaned from the MSD curves, the addition of nanoparticles strongly
quenched the propulsion speed to near 0 μm/s (see Figure 5). The decrease in propulsion
speed correlated with a decrease in the average separation distance.
Of particular interest was that the apparent propulsion speed decreased
monotonically with an average separation distance, but not depletant
volume fraction. These data corroborate the potential importance of
structural forces at high depletant volume fraction, as first shown
in Figure 3.

Figure 5 Apparent propulsion
speed was strongly quenched following the addition
of depletants. Propulsion speed decreased with a decrease in the average
separation distance of the Janus particle in response to the presence
of 20 nm nanoparticles.

4.3 Role
of Nanoparticles in Quenching Janus Particle
Propulsion
Simulations were developed to calculate the expected
reduction in propulsion speed because of the change in average separation
distance. Initially, agent-based simulations were conducted to determine
the appropriate free propulsion speed of a dipolar Janus particle
at infinity in the absence of all other particles. This set of calibration
simulations was conducted such that the free propulsion speed was
set and the apparent propulsion speed of particles at an average separation
distance of ∼200 nm was measured. The apparent propulsion speed
scaled linearly with the free propulsion speed (see Figure 6). This set of calibration
data was necessary because the apparent propulsion speed of a Janus
particle, measurable in the experiment, includes many factors such
as hydrodynamic advection, self-propulsion, and diffusion. However,
in the model, it is critical to set the isolated free propulsion speed,
which does not depend on the effect of other particles or diffusion.
Thus, we estimated the free propulsion speed by generating a simulation
fixing all parameters to the values in Table 1 and varying until the apparent net propulsion
speed matches the experimental observation at 200 nm. From this point
on, it will be that constant in all subsequent simulations. We also
note that the free propulsion speed is typically larger than the apparent
speed due to the fact that diffusion and the hydrodynamic hindrances
lead to decreases in the observed rate of motion.

Figure 6 Apparent propulsion speed vp as a function
of the free propulsion speed v0 for a
Janus particle at hAVG ∼ 200 nm.
The apparent propulsion speed scaled as roughly half that of the free
propulsion speed. The free propulsion speed was calibrated with this
data such that v0 = 1.38 μm/s for the remainder of
the experiments described herein.

Once the necessary free speed was determined = 1.38 μm/s,
a series of simulations were conducted at systematically different
heights to calculate the impact of hAVG on the apparent propulsion speed. Note that simulations were conducted
in a quasi-2D layer with all particles at a fixed separation distance.
Constructing the simulations in this fashion isolated the impact of
hydrodynamics. Apparent propulsion speed decreased monotonically with
decreased average separation distance (see Figure 7).

Figure 7 Apparent propulsion speed as a function of separation
distance
from simulation and experiment. Apparent propulsion speed in experiments
was strongly quenched following the addition of nanoparticles. However,
there was only a minor reduction in propulsion speed in comparison
to experimental observations. These data suggest that the reduction
in propulsion speed cannot solely be attributed to the hydrodynamic
hindrance of the form used herein.

Data summarized in Figure 7 provide a partial explanation for experimental observations.
In simulations, the propulsion speed at hAVG < 100 nm was reduced by ∼1/3 of the value at hAVG ∼ 200 nm. However, experimental observations
indicated that the propulsion
was reduced to nearly 0 μm/s. The additional reduction observed
in experiments could be a consequence of a number of contributing
factors. One such additional mechanism is in the change in fluid conductivity
as a consequence of adding charged nanoparticles. The conductivity
of the depletant suspension was measured to be 2.34, 18.5, and 36.45
μS/cm for ϕ = 0, 0.00059, and 0.0015, respectively. These
values correspond to resistivity values between 4274 and 274 Ω
m. Such changes in conductivity have been reported to reduce the catalytic
propulsion speed by an order of magnitude.28

We conducted control experiments to separate the impact of
fluid
conductivity and depletant concentration. Digital video microscopy
of a new batch of Janus particles prepared as described above was
conducted in (i) 5% H2O2, (ii) 5% H2O2 with a systematically adjusted concentration of PEG,
and (iii) 5% H2O2 with a systematically adjusted
concentration of NaCl. PEG had a negligible impact on solution conductivity,
with the highest PEG concentration (ϕ = 0.006) having a fluid
conductivity < 10 μS/cm. We also systematically adjusted
concentrations of NaCl between 0.075 and 0.6 mM such that the solution
conductivity ranged from ultrapure water up to 79.57 μS/cm,
which matched and went beyond our previously described experiments
with charged nanoparticles. Figure 8 shows the change in apparent swim speed as a function
of PEG volume fraction (see Figure 8A) and solution conductivity adjusted via the addition
of NaCl (see Figure 8B). These experiments revealed that both uncharged depletants and
increases in solution conductivity will quench the propulsion of catalytic
active particles. These control experiments, together with our earlier
described measurements with charged nanoparticles as depletant, suggest
that such effects can be synergized in the case when both are present.

Figure 8 Apparent
propulsion speed for Janus particles in uncharged depletant
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and NaCl. (A) Apparent propulsion speed
decreased as uncharged depletant volume fraction increased. PEG suspensions
had negligible changes in conductivity, yet still impacted the swim
speed. Similarly, (B) the apparent propulsion speed decreased at larger
electrolyte conductivity, which was adjusted by changing the NaCl
concentration between 0.075 and 0.6 mM. Error bars are the standard
deviation calculated from multiple particles (Np) in multiple fluid cells. The number of particles Np as a function of increasing depletant concentration
were Np = 29, 13, 14, and 15 and as a
function of increasing conductivity Np = 29, 14, 15, and 9.

Although measurements
with charged depletants, uncharged depletants,
and salt demonstrate that depletion and solution conductivity have
a synergistic effect on the propulsion of active Janus particles,
there are additional potential mechanisms for propulsion reduction.
The dynamic drag associated with the nanoparticles surrounding the
Janus particle could also reduce swimming. A colloidal particle will
be enveloped by some equilibrium distribution of nanoparticles. When
moving, however, the Janus particle will need to move this cloud of
nanoparticles, thereby creating additional hindrance that may slow
the propulsion. Finally, when the Janus particle is almost touching
the boundary, nonlinear lubrication forces between the particle and
the boundary may become a dominant interaction, which is not explicitly
accounted for in the hydrodynamic models (6) and (7).

5 Conclusions
Experiments and simulations were conducted
to elucidate the impact
of charged nanoparticles on the propulsion of active Janus particles.
Digital video microscopy measurements in conjunction with particle
tracking revealed that Janus particles propel in the presence of H2O2, but quench to nearly nil speed in the presence
of nanoparticles. Further, experiments revealed that the reduction
of the average separation distance of passive particles was nonmonotonic
with nanoparticle volume fraction, suggesting that structural forces
will play a role at high volume fractions. Agent-based simulations
were conducted of dipolar Janus particles at systematically varied
separation distance to determine the influence of hydrodynamic quenching
of propulsion. The speed of Janus particles decreased when the separation
distance was systematically decreased. Although the trend from simulations
qualitatively matched results from experiments, the magnitude of quenching
determined from simulations was smaller than what was found in experiments.
Simulation results suggest some influence of hydrodynamic quenching
when bringing an active colloid closer to a nearby boundary. In addition,
the increase in fluid conductivity associated with the addition of
nanoparticles is a factor for the difference between experiments and
simulated propulsion speeds. Follow-up experiments delineating the
impact of depletion and conductivity showed that both likely contribute
to the reduction of speed for an active Janus particle. These data
show the synergistic effects arising from depletion, and changes in
conductivity should be considered when studying the dynamics of active
Janus particles near a boundary.
