Under denaturing
conditions such as low pH and elevated temperatures,
proteins in vitro can misfold and aggregate to form long rigid rods
called amyloid fibrils; further self-assembly can lead to larger structures
termed spherulites. Both of these aggregates resemble amyloid tangles
and plaques associated with Alzheimer’s disease in vivo. The
ability to form such aggregates in a multitude of different proteins
suggests that it is a generic ability in their mechanism to form.
Little is known about the structure of these large spherulites ranging
from 5 to 100 microns and whether they can reproducibly form in amyloid
β (1-40) (Aβ40), a 40-amino acid residue peptide, which
is one of the major components of Alzheimer’s amyloid deposits.
Here, we show that spherulites can readily form in Aβ40 under
certain monomerization and denaturing conditions. Using polarized
and nonpolarized Raman spectroscopy, we analyzed the secondary structure
of spherulites formed from three different proteins: insulin, β-lactoglobulin
(BLG), and Aβ40. Visually, these spherulites have a characteristic
“Maltese Cross” structure under crossed polarizers through
an optical microscope. However, our results indicate that insulin
and Aβ40 spherulites have similar core structures consisting
mostly of random coils with radiating fibrils, whereas BLG mostly
contains β-sheets and fibrils that are likely to be spiraling
from the core to the edge.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A number
of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), type II diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease are associated
with aggregates of excess protein deposited in the tissue or organs,
making protein aggregation an active and very important field of research.
These aggregates contain β-strands that lie perpendicular to
the fibril axis; they are usually long (∼1 μm) and with
an unbranched morphology, with fibril diameters ranging from 10 to
20 nm.1 Amyloid fibrils are thought to
form via a polymerization mechanism, in which the protein first (partially)
misfolds and forms stable nuclei, followed by the attachment of monomers
to the growing ends.2

However, larger-scale
structures are seen in the post-mortem brains
of Alzheimer’s patients.3−5 Sections of brain tissue viewed
under crossed polarizers show that a structure is present resembling
the “spherulites” seen in many other in vitro systems
including insulin,6 β-lactoglobulin
(BLG),7 hen egg white lysozyme,8 human proislet amyloid polypeptide (ProIAPP1-48),9 and amyloid β(1-42)
(Aβ42).5 These proteins have all
been shown to demonstrate that the amyloid fibrils further self-assemble
to form highly ordered spherical aggregates, microns or tens of microns
in size, which have been named spherulites after similar structures
that commonly form from viscous or impure polymer melts.10

Spherulitic structures have been observed
in a wide range of alloys,11 volcanic rocks,12 synthetic polymers,13 liquid crystals,8,14 and gels,15 with the literature on these
structures dating back as far as the 19th century. Starch granules
have also been described as spherulites, along with certain carbohydrates
such as chitin, which forms such structures through lateral molecular
association.16 Between crossed polarizers,
spherulites exhibit characteristic “Maltese cross” patterns,
which rotate as the polarizers are rotated.6

The characteristic Maltese cross pattern has been observed
in a
rat model of AD,17 in brains of human patients
suffering from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease,18 and in neuritic plaques, a hallmark of AD,3,4 as well as in other protein systems in vivo,19,20 suggesting that the mechanism to form both spherulites in vitro
and plaques found in many amyloid diseases may be similar.21

House et al. were the first to observe
spherulites formed from
in vitro Aβ42 and compare them to spherulites in the human brain
tissue.5 During this study, House et al.
showed that copper abolished the secondary structure β-sheet
of preformed Aβ42 amyloid fibrils, whereby copper binds to fibrillar
Aβ42. These findings are significant to the field and could
potentially be beneficial for AD therapy.5 In collaboration with House et al., we have formed in vitro spherulitic
aggregates in Aβ42 and confirmed the characteristic Maltese
cross pattern.4 In this study, the Aβ42
spherulites were formed under near physiological conditions, after
preformed aggregates were first abolished following an addition of
an excess of copper in Aβ42. Interestingly, the in vitro Aβ42
spherulites were near-identical structures to that observed in 30
μm-thick sections of diseased brain tissue from patients with
AD.4,21 More recently, Exley et al. also have shown
that ProIAPP1-48 could form spherulites and that
copper was a potent in vitro inhibitor.9,22 This has major
implications for type 2 diabetes because IAPP and ProIAPP1-48 are associated with the death of β cells in the pancreas.22 Large spherically symmetric structures have
been reported to form in amyloid β(1-40) (Aβ40),23,24 but their structures have not been shown to exhibit the Maltese
cross patterns found in vivo.3

One
challenge, readily discernible in the literature, is the irreproducibility
of the starting material when working with Aβ.25 Studying Aβ in vitro requires a well-defined material,
but the intrinsic propensity of Aβ to self-associate creates
substantial experimental problems when attempting to reproducibly
form aggregates.26 This issue with Aβ
studies has led to the adoption of peptide preparation procedures
that vary from group to group. The overall aim in each case is to
remove all preformed aggregates to give a reproducible homogeneous
initial state of the peptide that will give reliable and robust kinetics,
but the variability in subsequent outcomes suggests that this may
not have been achieved. The preparation method for forming spherulites
in Aβ42 has been well documented by Exley et al.4 Here, we focus on the in vitro preparation method for forming
spherulites in Aβ40.

The observed Maltese cross pattern
was mathematically shown by
Morse et al. to be caused by the uniaxial behavior of the building
blocks (amyloid fibrils in the case of protein aggregates) that are
oriented radially within the spherulites.27 Light paths passing through a spherulite encounter many fibrils
orientated at different angles. The overall retardation along the
light path is the sum of the individual retardations from every contributing
fibril. At the center of the spherulite, the total retardation is
zero due to the cancellation of effects in different directions; it
reaches a maximum at approximately two-thirds from the center of the
spherulite and then decreases to zero at the periphery, as the decrease
in the thickness counteracts the birefringence of the fibers.27−30

The dark centers of the spherulites formed from different
proteins
have various core sizes that do not correlate with the diameter of
the aggregates.6,31 These non-birefringent cores
still form in insulin even when filtration is used before denaturing,
suggesting that the core is due to some structure of the protein and
not from any external effect. The non-birefringent core in insulin
is thought to be due to collapsed fibrils that have lost their orientation
because of stress as the spherulite continues to grow;7 however, this hypothesis has not been proven. We have previously
shown that although the optical birefringence patterns of insulin
and β-lactoglobulin spherulites are different, the cores of
the spherulites are too small to directly compare the birefringence
signals.32

Many techniques, including
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy, have been used
to compare the secondary structure of native proteins with that of
denatured proteins that form amyloid fibrils.33−44 In particular, both native insulin and BLG show a remarkable spectral
change in the amide I region because of carbonyl stretching (C=O)
after forming amyloid fibrils.34,41,45,46 The peaks of interest are those
assigned to the β-sheet, α-helix, and random coil structures.

Spatially localized Raman measurements allow for a secondary structure
or crystallinity to be investigated at different points within a given
aggregate. Galiotis et al. successfully used this technique to evaluate
the crystallinity in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) along the diameter
of a spherical aggregate.47 By analyzing
the intensity signal of the 809 cm–1 band (corresponding
to crystallinity) normalized by the 830, 841, and 854 cm–1 bands (corresponding to noncrystallinity) along the diameter, they
showed that crystallinity was symmetric and peaked at the nucleus.
Using a setup similar to that used by Galiotis et al., we use Raman
spectroscopy to analyze the secondary structure of the amyloid fibrils
that are thought to be radially orientated within a spherulite. The
utility of Raman spectroscopy as a beneficial technique to analyze
anisotropic biological specimens was also recently reported by Lednev
et al. who showed that the structural organization of insulin fibrils
could be revealed using this methodology.46

Previous preliminary work on insulin alone showed a dramatic
increase
in the random coils and a decrease in the β-sheet content in
the central region.32 Here, we show the
secondary structure as a function of position across the diameter
of the spherulites in insulin, BLG, and Aβ40, and how these
structures differ from one another. The orientations of the fibrils
within a spherulite are also compared using polarized Raman spectroscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Secondary Structure of
Insulin Spherulites
An insulin spherulite (formed under acidic
conditions and elevated
temperatures, see Experimental Section) visualized
using the microscope attached to a Raman spectrometer is shown in Figure 1A, where the dotted
line highlights the boundary of the spherulite. To compare the secondary
structures across the spherulite, spectra were recorded, analyzed,
and fitted every 5 μm along the x- and y-axes as indicated by the blue and black arrows, respectively.
A typical Raman spectrum was recorded from the insulin spherulite
(indicated by the green dot in Figure 1A), and fitted peaks are shown in Figure 1B, where the main peaks of
interest are in the amide I region (1600–1700 cm–1).

attached to the Raman spectroscope. The blue and black arrows indicate
the x- and y-directions, respectively.
The scale bar is 10 μm. (B) Amide spectra region from the location

peaks, individual fits, and an overall fit are shown in the figure.
(C) Raman peak intensities for the β-sheet, α-helix, and
random coil across the insulin spherulite in the x-direction (top) and y-direction (bottom), where
0 μm marks the center. The β-sheet intensity drops significantly
at the center of the spherulite, whereas the random coil intensity
increases slightly. (D) Percentage contributions of the β-sheet,
α-helix, and random coil in the x- and y-directions. The largest contribution is from the β-sheet,
which decreases at the center. (E) Raman peak intensities for the
β-sheet, α-helix, and random coil in the insulin spherulite
as the material below the focus point increases (increasing z depth), where 0 μm is the coverslip plane. (F) Polarized
β-sheet intensity across the spherulite in the x and y paths as indicated in Figure S1F. The β-sheet intensity is a minimum at the
medians of the x-paths, suggesting that the fibrils
are perpendicular to the direction of polarization at this point.

A dominant peak is clearly seen
at approximately 1673 cm–1, corresponding to the
β-sheet structure.48 Because native
insulin is mainly α-helical (peak
at 1649 cm–1) and does not contain any structures
incorporating such a large quantity of β-sheets,49 the spherulite must contain a substantial quantity
of denatured proteins in the form of amyloid fibrils. Raman peaks
assigned to the β-sheet, α-helix, and random coils in
the amide I region are given in Table 1.

The absolute intensity
(which is affected by the density and the
thickness of the material) of the peaks can be plotted at each location
across the spherulite in both the x- and y-directions, as shown in Figure 1C. Although there is a drop in intensity
for both β-sheet and α-helix at the center, the signal
does not drop to zero, suggesting that amyloid is present in the section
through the core region. However, the random coil intensity is a maximum
at the core, suggesting that more amorphous material is located at
the center of the spherulite where the birefringence is lower, along
with a small proportion of amyloid.

On analyzing the absolute
signal across the spherulites, we can
gain further structural information following a normalization procedure. Figure S1A shows a schematic representation of
the laser penetration through the spherulite. The absolute intensity
of the secondary structures is higher in the thickest region of the
spherulite (region two in Figure S1A).
To account for this thickness change across the spherulite whereby
the edges have a lower mass thickness, it is necessary to normalize
with respect to the sum of all three secondary structures so that
the difference in sample illumination will be negligible. For the
β-sheet intensity, the normalized intensity will be 1  where Iβ is the intensity of the
β-sheet structure, Iα is the
intensity of the α helix structure,
and IR is the intensity of the random
coil structure. At positions 1 and 2 in Figure S1A, the normalized intensities are 2  and 3  where λ and γ are factors
that
take into account the volume fraction of the material, where γ
> λ. Both factors cancel out, and therefore the volume of
penetration
is not an issue when analyzing the normalized contribution of the
secondary structures at positions along the spherulite.

Figure 1D shows
the normalized intensities representing the percentage of each type
of secondary structure in the x- and y-directions, where 100% is the total contribution of the three combined
secondary structures. The largest contribution at any location in
the spherulite is from the β-sheets, which makes up approximately
75% of the structure near the spherulite edge, dropping to approximately
60% at the core. The random coil contribution is a maximum at this
central point, increasing from approximately 15% to 25% near the edge,
indicating the presence of an amorphous material at the core. The
same trend was found in the y-direction. The increase
in the amorphous material at the core would explain the dark center
in the Maltese cross patterns readily observed in the spherulites,
because one would expect its birefringence to be low.

The secondary
structure distribution as a function of position
was similar in two more insulin spherulites (see Figure S1B,C). The same trend in all spherulites suggests
that the non-birefringent core contains a larger amount of random
coils and less β-sheets, and hence there is no uniform structure
across the whole spherulite. Thus, the non-birefringent core is likely
to be made up of a disordered material and a small quantity of amyloid
fibrils. A higher proportion of random coils at the core suggests
that the spherulite formation may begin with the amorphous protein
acting as a nucleus with the fibrils then growing out from this center50 or the collapse and disorganization of the fibrils
at the center.

The intensities of the β-sheet, α-helix,
and random
coil signals were compared with increasing z-depth
within a spherulite at three independent locations, two avoiding the
center (black arrows) and one through the center (red arrow), as shown
in the schematic spherulite in Figure S1D.

Figure 1E
(top and
bottom panels) shows that the intensity increases for all assigned
secondary structures as the thickness and therefore the scattering
volume increases at the left hand and right hand sides of the spherulite
(black arrows on Figure S1D). The intensities
were not normalized because the volume illumination is crucial for
the depth analysis. The volume of material for which light is scattered
will increase by 20 μm3 as the depth is increased
by 5 μm at each position and the beam spot size is approximately
4 μm2 in cross section regardless of depth. A different
trend is observed in Figure 1E (middle panel) when increasing the depth through the core
(red arrow on Figure S1D) compared with
the case when the core is avoided. The gradient of intensity of the
β-sheet (and the α-helix) decreases when the laser penetrates
through the approximate location of the core and then increases as
it leaves the core. This difference in trend at the core, compared
with the edge of the spherulite, can be explained by the decrease
in the β-sheets and increase in the random coils within the
core. The β-sheet signal does not increase when going through
the core (z-depth ≈ 5–10 μm),
consistent with the drop in the β-sheet intensity observed in
the x- and y-directions. This analysis
is consistent with a spherical core of amorphous/random coil material
surrounded above and below by the radiating β-sheet-rich fibrils.

2.2 Amyloid Fibril Orientations in Insulin Spherulites
The Maltese cross extinction pattern suggests that the spherulite
is composed of radially orientated amyloid fibrils.6 To confirm this using polarized Raman spectroscopy, the
intensity signal of the β-sheet content can be compared across
the spherulite, indicating the orientation of the fibrils. This relationship
is given by the formula 4  where a is a constant and
θ is the angle between the molecular bonding of the protein
backbone and the direction of the polarized laser (and therefore analyzer
because both are parallel to each other).51 A maximum intensity will arise when the C=O carbonyl groups
and hence the fibrils are parallel to the direction of polarization
(Figure S1E).52

Figure S1F shows an insulin spherulite
visualized using confocal microscopy in 2D; the direction of the laser
polarization is given by the black double-headed arrow, which is parallel
to the defined x-axis of the spherulite. The intensity
across the spherulite is recorded along six paths; three in the x-direction, X1, X2, and X3, and three in the y-direction, Y1, Y2, and Y3, where X2, and Y2 go through the core
as shown in Figure S1F.

The intensities
were normalized with respect to the random coil
intensity only at the corresponding positions because the α-helix
signals are very weak when using polarized laser Raman spectroscopy.
Opposing trends are apparent when comparing the β-sheet intensity
in the x- and y-directions. The
minimum and maximum β-sheet intensities occur at the middle
of all x and y paths, respectively.
In the x-direction (paths that are parallel to the
direction of polarization), the overall signal is higher than in the y-direction. This suggests that the C=O groups within
the fibrils are mostly aligned with the x-direction.
The β-sheet intensity increases at either side of the minima
in the x-direction, suggesting that the fibrils are
more aligned with the direction of polarization away from the median
of the X paths. At the core, more fibrils may be
disordered and from nonpolarized Raman, we can see that there is also
more amorphous material giving the lowest intensity signal.

In the y-direction, the scattering from the spherulite
increases at the center, whereas the nonpolarized data across the
diameter decreases at the center. Because the form of the polarized
and nonpolarized signals is not the same across the identical path
(Y2 path), the polarized data must be
a result of the orientation of fibrils from both the x- and y-directions combined. The β-sheet intensity
is a maximum at the middle of the three paths along the Y-direction, implying that the fibrils are most aligned with the direction
of polarization at this point. The β-sheet intensity is a minimum
at the edges. The results from the polarizing data suggest that the
fibrils radiate out from the center of the spherulite (see Figure S2A for schematic interpretations), consistent
with the earlier observations.50

2.3 Secondary Structure and Fibril Orientations
in BLG
Like insulin, BLG also forms spherulites readily under
acidic conditions and elevated temperatures in vitro. However, unlike
insulin spherulites, Figure 2A shows that the absolute intensity of all secondary structures
is maximum at the core of the BLG spherulite. This suggests that BLG
spherulites may have more β-sheet material in general at their
centers in contrast to insulin spherulites that have greater core
diameters.

Figure 2 (A) Raman peak intensities for the β-sheet, α-helix,
and random coil across a BLG spherulite in the x-direction
(top) and y-direction (bottom), where 0 μm
marks the center. (B) Percentage of the β-sheet, α-helix,
and random coil across a BLG spherulite in the x-direction
(top) and y-direction (bottom), where 0 μm
marks the center. (C) Polarized β-sheet intensity across a BLG
spherulite to indicate the orientation of the fibrils in the x- and y-axes.

Both insulin and BLG spherulites consist of approximately
75% of
β-sheet overall. However, the BLG levels of all three secondary
structures seem to be constant across the spherulite (Figure 2B; results reproduced in two
more BLG spherulites, Figure S2B,C) in
contrast to insulin, which decreases in the β-sheet and increases
in the random coil content toward the center.

Polarized Raman
spectroscopy showed that the insulin spherulites
possessed radial symmetry, as discussed in the previous section (Figure 1F). BLG differs in
its internal structure (Figure 2C) because it has fibrils aligned more at one side of the
spherulite in both the x and y-directions.
It has been well documented in the lab of Mezzenga et al. that at
the single fibril level, the structure and stiffness of the BLG fibrils
can be altered depending on the environmental denaturing conditions
(incubation temperature, pH, ionic strength, and surface interface).53−57 For example, BLG fibrils can form a twisted ribbon or helical ribbon
structure when grown under mild or severe denaturing conditions, respectively.54,55 Our observations suggest that the fibril may spiral out from the
core (not necessarily twisting along the fibril axis), as shown schematically
in Figure S2D; this structure would then
give β-sheet a maximum when the fibrils at the end of the spherulite
were curved so that the fibrils were parallel with the orientation
of polarization. The structure of the bending fibrils and no core
is consistent with the results of the work by Poulin et al.: when
fibrils radiate out from a seed, the splay energy is lower than the
bending energy giving radial spherulites, whereas bending fibrils
arise when there is no core and the bending energy is lower.58 The implied BLG structure is also similar to
the bending extinction pattern observed from the phase transitions
of radial hedgehogs to hyperbolic structures in nematic liquid crystals
because of the reorientation of molecules.15

BLG spherulites shown here differ from insulin in terms of
the
structure of the core and orientation of the fibrils. These differences
in the structure may reflect differences in the properties of the
fibrils themselves or the way that they aggregate and pack. Although
these structures appear similar through an optical microscope, detailed
secondary structures show differences that cannot be detected by visual
methods alone.

2.4 Secondary Structure and
Fibril Orientations
in Aβ40
The main issue when forming amyloid aggregates
in vitro from Aβ is their irreproducibility apparently due to
rapid self- and random aggregation.25 Here,
we formed Aβ40 spherulites by employing a new reproducible monomerization
and denaturing protocol. First, we tested two preparation methods
aimed at eliminating pre-existing aggregates, creating a monomeric
Aβ stock solution from peptide lyophilizates. The first method
involves the use of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and HFIP separately
to disrupt hydrophobic interactions in aggregated amyloid preparations,
as shown in Table 2. This method has been previously shown to yield monomeric peptide
solutions with α-helical and random coil secondary structures.25 The second method uses HFIP alone, as shown
in Table 2, which avoids
crossing the isoelectric point (pI) where the peptides are most insoluble,
a condition which could lead to rapid aggregation and may prevent
subsequent formation of long-range ordered structures.59

Following both preparation methods,
a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) was prepared with the addition of 0.1 M NaCl and was added
to the powdered Aβ40 peptide in 1.5 mL Eppendorfs to give concentrations
of 30, 50, 150, and 300 μM. The lowest peptide concentration
has been widely used for amyloid fibril experiments, without spherulites
being identified; therefore, the higher concentrations (150 and 300
μM) may be necessary to form larger structures such as spherulites.
The peptide concentrations were verified within a 5% error using a
Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (see Experimental
Section). The peptide solutions
were incubated at 37 °C for 14 days, and samples produced using
all incubation conditions were repeated three times. Using both TFA
and HFIP separately before incubation resulted in all samples forming
amyloid fibrils. However, only one repeat from two different conditions
formed spherulites: 150 μM at 37 °C and 300 μM, at
37 °C. However, using HFIP alone to monomerize the protein resulted
in all repeat samples incubated at 37 °C with 0.1 M NaCl at peptide
concentrations of either 150 or 300 μM forming spherulites.
It therefore seems that indeed avoiding the pI of the protein is vitally
important for reproducible spherulite formation.

The characteristic
Maltese cross pattern of Aβ40 spherulites
(Figure 3A) resembled
those readily observed in insulin and BLG;6,31 both
have four quadrants of birefringence and a non-birefringent core.
This second protocol prevents
the peptide from crossing its pI (where the peptide is least soluble),
and hence random aggregation may be slower, giving spherulites the
time to form. This result indicates the importance of the preparation
method and the environmental conditions when forming spherulitic amyloid
aggregates. To gain further structural information, ESEM was used
to image the spherulites formed in Aβ40 at a concentration of
300 μM, as shown in Figure 3B. For comparison, the spherulites formed in insulin
are shown in Figure 3C. It is quite clear from the images that spherulites from both insulin
and Aβ40 have similar morphologies from an external perspective.

intensity across an amyloid β (Aβ) spherulite to indicate
the orientation of the fibrils in the x and y paths.

As with that of the insulin
spherulites, Raman spectroscopy of
the Aβ40 spherulite reveals a decrease in the absolute β-sheet
intensity at the core (Figure 3D) and a slight increase in the random coil structure with
the spherulite containing approximately 80% of a β-sheet structure,
which drops to 70% at the core (Figure 3E). The random coil structure increases from approximately
5 to 10%. However, in contrast to insulin, the results suggest that
there is more β-sheet content in an Aβ spherulite than
in an insulin spherulite; the β-sheet percentage also decreases
less across the Aβ spherulite, a result reproduced in two other
spherulites (Figure S2E,F).

The polarized
Raman secondary structure signals (Figure 3F) show the same trend as insulin
spherulites. Hence, the proposed structure for Aβ40 spherulites
is the same. Aβ40 spherulites are structurally more similar
to those of insulin than BLG, having a core region with more random
coils and less β-sheets, and radially orientated fibrils outside
the core.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Sample Preparation
BLG (product no.
L0130) and bovine insulin (product no. I5500) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
These and all other chemicals were of analytical grade or better and
used without further purification. Solutions were prepared by dissolving
the required amount of protein powder in distilled and deionized water
to give concentrations of 5.6 and 40 mg/mL for insulin and BLG, respectively.
The pH was adjusted with HCl for insulin (pH 2) and BLG (pH 1.6).
The samples were incubated for 24 h at 70 °C to form spherulites.

Aβ was purchased from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) as
lyophilized trifluoroacetate salts (Batch H1194). Two methods were
used to form spherulites, the first method eliminated pre-existing
aggregates using TFA, followed by HFIP to disrupt hydrophobic interactions.
The second method used HFIP alone, creating a monomeric Aβ stock
solution, after which a 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with
the addition of 0.1 M NaCl was prepared and added to the Aβ40
powder peptide in 1.5 mL Eppendorfs to give final concentrations of
30, 50, 150, and 300 μM. All aliquot concentrations were confirmed
by analyzing 1 μL of aliquots using a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer
that is specifically designed for accurately measuring the concentrations
of very small volumes. The Aβ40 peptide samples were then incubated
at 37 °C for 14 days.

3.2 Raman Spectroscopy
A Renishaw System
2000 Raman spectrometer coupled to an Olympus microscope was used
to monitor the secondary structure within the spherulites. A HeNe
laser (λ = 633 nm), focused to a spot size of approximately
2 μm on the surface of the sample using a 50× objective
lens, was used to excite Raman scattering from the spherulites. To
obtain a clear Raman spectra, an exposure time of 100 s (five accumulations
of 20 s) was used. This procedure was repeated three times at each
location to give an average spectrum and the corresponding standard
error of the mean (SEM). In sections where the orientation of fibrils
was examined, the monochromatic light from the laser was polarized
using a polarizing filter, and the analyzer was in place to detect
only the polarized light from the scattered radiation.

3.3 Analysis of Data
Raman spectra were
collected in the range of 1550–1750 cm–1,
three times at each location. These spectra were fitted using mixed
Gaussian and Lorentzian functions (see Figure 1B for an example of fitting) using the Wire
3.1 software (Renishaw, UK). For the secondary structure analysis,
the absolute intensities were normalized by the sum of all secondary
structures to account for the variation in density and to give a percentage
contribution of each secondary structure, where 100% is the total
contribution of all three secondary structures (see eqs 1 and 2 for
the normalization procedure). Only in the case of analyzing the orientation
of fibrils, using polarized Raman, were the β-sheet intensities
normalized with the random coil peaks because the α-helix signal
was weak. Spherulites were analyzed individually because they vary
in size as do their cores.

3.4 ESEM
All spherulite
imaging was carried
out on an Electroscan ESEM 2010 microscope (FEI UK). Aliquots of the
Aβ40, BLG, and insulin solutions were pipetted onto copper stubs,
which were then placed inside of the chamber of the microscope. Using
a Peltier-chip-controlled device located under the sample holder,
samples were allowed to equilibrate to 2 °C and were kept sufficiently
cold so that that liquid did not fully evaporate when the chamber
pressure was pumped down. Drops of water were placed around the sample
to maintain hydration while pumping down. The chamber was flooded
with water vapor repeatedly until a pressure of less than 5 Torr was
achieved.5

4 Conclusions
Insulin and Aβ40 spherulites are dominated at their edges
by β-sheet structures, whose contribution decreases at the center
but is not negligible. The random coil intensity increases at the
center, suggesting that a combination of amorphous material and unaligned
amyloid fibrils make up the core. The fibrils were shown to radiate
out from the center in insulin and Aβ proteins. The increased
disordered material and reduced amyloid fibril content at the core
may explain the absence of birefringence in this region using cross-polarized
light.

The insulin and Aβ40 spherulite formation may require
amorphous
protein to act as a nucleus from which subsequent fibril growth can
occur. These fibrils at the center may collapse as the spherulite
continues to grow, which accounts for the β-sheet presence at
the core albeit reduced in amount. The collapsing fibrils
lose their orientation showing no birefringence between crossed polarizers.
The orientation of the fibrils was shown to be radial from the center
because of the increasing and decreasing β-sheet intensities
in different orientations depending on the alignment with the direction
of polarization.

BLG showed a dramatic increase in the β-sheet
intensity at
the center, which may be due to this region of the spherulite being
denser as when normalized, the β-sheet percentage remained almost
constant. The amyloid fibrils in BLG did not have the same orientation
as in insulin or Aβ40. Instead of radial symmetry, the observed
β-sheet intensities imply a spiral of fibrils from the core
to the edge.

Forming spherulites in Aβ40 is possible and
reproducible
under various conditions including those simulating physiological
conditions in vitro. However, to accomplish this, we found that using
HFIP alone before incubation is necessary for the formation of spherulites
consistently in Aβ40, when incubated at high concentrations
(150 or 300 μM) for 14 days at 37 °C. Passing through the
pI seems to hinder reproducibility.

Although the proteins reported
to form spherulites look macroscopically
similar under polarized light, their internal structures may differ,
and hence, their formation and packing cannot be assumed to be the
same.
