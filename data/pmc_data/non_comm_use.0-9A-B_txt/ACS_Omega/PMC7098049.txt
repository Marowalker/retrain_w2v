Molecular interactions are important for various areas of research.
Interactions between a target molecule and probe molecules having
their own interaction capacity can be quantified via six interaction
parameters. The theoretical interaction energy can be calculated from
the interaction parameters, while that of experimental is measured
using a calorimeter. These two methods are proposed in this work to
calculate them. The first is based on an equation linking Hansen’s
and Drago’s parameters. The second method is based on an experimental
matrix formed by the interaction energies of tert-butanol with the probe molecules characterized by their six interaction
parameters. Finally, the quality of the experiment matrix is checked
for the effectiveness of the six experimental interaction parameters
of the target molecule, which is tert-butanol. Then,
these experimental values are compared with theoretical values from
interaction parameters.

Introduction
Studying molecular interactions, which are also called noncovalent
or intermolecular interactions, is essential for understanding biological
structures and processes. They are important in various fields1−13 such as drug design, material science, sensors, anotechnology, separation,
and origins of life. Furthermore, complex solid and liquid molecules
have their own interaction capacities, which can be quantified14 using a set of six molecular interaction parameters
∂d, ∂p, Ea, Eb, Ca, and Cb.

Here, ∂d and ∂p (MPa1/2) are Hansen’s magnetic and electrical parameters,15,16 and Ea, Eb, Ca, and Cb (kcal1/2 mol–1/2) are Drago’s
interaction parameters17 concerning chemical
bonds having charge transfer and orbital overlap as processes. This
indicates that there are three types of interactions, each of which
has a well-determined origin.

The most important result of molecular interactions is the interaction
energy of the interacting molecules. The latter can be determined
experimentally via the mixing energy or via theoretical calculations
based on interaction parameters.

To experimentally determine interaction energy, the use of probe
molecules in addition to their six interaction parameters is required.

This study aims to establish the above-mentioned approach for determining
both the interaction parameters and interaction energy. To this end,
this work uses tert-butanol as a solute and diethyl
ether, i-propylether, n-butylether,
triethylalamine, diethylamide, pyridine, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide,
and acetonitrile as solvents or probe molecules for tert-butanol.

Results
The two main results are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

The demonstration has been done to know that it is possible to
calculate the interaction energies between molecules based on the
knowledge of the interaction capacity defined by the six interaction
parameters ∂d, ∂p, Ea, Eb, Ca, and Cb. The relative errors
between the calculated and experimental values are low and acceptable.

Finally, the capacity of the interaction of the target molecule tert-butanol has been defined by the same six parameters.
It is possible to explain the important deviation on Ea that can be seen on the second table.

Discussion
The objective of this work was to demonstrate that it is possible
to define the interaction capacity of molecules using the mixing model
proposed recently14 by determining a group
of six interaction parameters and then calculating the interaction
energy of the same molecule in different solvents using these parameters.
To this end, tert-butanol mixed with nine different
solvents was used in this study.

The prediction of the solubility in different solvents was not
considered in this work. In such a case, it would have been necessary
to use an appropriate model taking into account of the enthalpic and
entropic parts of the dissolution process.25

In this research paper, each molecule is characterized by its six
interaction parameters and its molar volume. So from the point of
view of the interaction, our paper works with a space of six dimensions
and these six independent parameters (∂d, ∂p, Ea, Cb, Eb, and Cb) characterizing different types of interactions.

The reason for the six-dimensional space in this work is as follows.
The energy of the cohesion or interaction, obviously, comes from three
types of interactions: magnetic dipole–dipole (mobile charges),
electric dipole–dipole (localized charges), and transfer processes
of charges and orbital recovering.

For the hydrogen bonding interaction, it is necessary to mobilize
the four parameters Ea, Ca, Eb, and Cb. In the case of a solute, moreover, our proposed model
still requires the use of its molar volume V giving
the notion of the molecular size.

For many authors having worked with the three Hansen’s parameters
(∂d, ∂p, and ∂h), their space is a three-dimensional space. However, these three
parameters are not homogeneous because the parameter ∂h is a function of four interaction components according to
the equation  

Therefore, different combinations of these four parameters Ea, Ca, Eb, and Cb having different
values can give the same value of ∂h.

Consequently, the Hansen’s sphere is an apparent interaction
sphere. Considering the hydrogen bonds, it is necessary to introduce
several kinds of corrections, including thermodynamic corrections
to get closer to reality.26

It is impossible to build any thermodynamic descriptive model with
these three Hansen parameters, including the volume of the molecules
as in our model. One of the important goals of scientific research
is to be able to predict phenomena; we can only predict something
on the basis of a descriptive model. Experience shows that the nature
of the solvents plays an important role in chemical reactions. Between
our method of quantification of interaction energy and the QSAR method,27 the common point lies in obtaining an experiment
matrix in which the parameters characterizing the solvents can be
figured explicitly.

The cited work27 used a 412 × 76
experiment matrix, while our work used a 9 × 6 experiment matrix.
The difference between the two methods is in the choice of parameters
for solvents. Our work uses six interaction parameters—two
from Hansen’s type and four from the Drago type. All of which
are extracted from the cohesion energy and the quality of the experiment
matrix tested; in contrast, the work with the QSAR method used 24
parameters or descriptors for the solvents; these did not necessary
arise from the energy of cohesion and there was no test conducted
to ascertain the quality of the 412 × 76 experiment matrix used.
This is a significant difference from the point of view of rigor.
Ref (14) has been cited
in our paper for comparison purposes.

The introduction of six interaction parameters and the construction
of the interaction model were done gradually, and the first applications
are in the choice of solvents to have the best performance for microencapsulation.
The following Refs3 and (28) have been
cited in our paper for comparison purposes.

Although the nine solvents are not amphoteric,24 it is an important condition for obtaining suitable values
for V∂2h/n = EaEb + CaCb. They have been
chosen because of their interaction parameters, which are partially
published (Table 3).
In addition, their experimental mixing energies with tert-butanol have also been published,18 and
these are indispensable for the subsequent comparison of the theoretical
and experimental interaction energies (Table 11).

As can be seen from Table 3, it is impossible to directly determine the values of the
six interaction parameters for tert-butanol and the
nine solvents. Therefore, a method has been proposed herein for approaching
them using the equation V∂2h/n = EaEb + CaCb. This equation has an infinite number of solutions even
in a very limited range. However, there is only one solution that
corresponds to the actual case. Various solutions were tested via
an iterative method. The solution X1i =
9/10X1imax was retained as it was the
most optimal. The complete list of the six parameters estimated for
the ten molecules as a result of using the optimal solution is presented
in Table 7.

Furthermore, multilinear regression was applied to an experimental
matrix; this allowed us to determine the values of the tert-butanol interaction parameters. Considering the part of the work
as a control of the quality of the proposed interaction model, the
chosen experiment matrix presented a result that is similar to the
estimated values presented in Table 7.

However, Ea = 2.58 (kcal1/2 mol–1/2) was significantly higher. Using this
value, the expression V∂2h/n = EaEb + CaCb gives (2.58 × 1.74 + 0.20 × 0.80) = 4.65 (kcal
mol–1) compared to a Hansen’s value of 2.51
(kcal mol–1). This difference is due to the fact
that the nine solvents are not amphoteric.24 This means that their V∂2h/n value is close to zero, which must have
had repercussions on the multilinear regression results.

Using them to calculate the interaction energies between tert-butanol and the nine solvents, results (Table 8) that match well with the experimentally
determined energies (Table 10) were obtained with the mean relative error for the nine
solvents being 4.51%.

Finally, by observing the different values of the interaction parameters
presented in Table 13, we can determine whether the target molecules are basic or acidic.
In the case of tert-butanol, the charge transfer
(Ea, Eb) is
substantially more important than the overlap orbital (Ca, Cb) process.

Conclusions
The comparison of theoretically and experimentally determined values
in the context of the interactions of tert-butanol
with nine solvent molecules shows that the ability of a molecule to
interact can be quantified using its six interaction parameters ∂d, ∂d, Ea, Ca, Eb, and Cb.

The bridging equation V∂2h/n = EaEb + CaCb is essential for elucidating the nature of ∂h.

The experimental energy of the interaction with different molecules
can be determined using the expression  

The components of the energy of the theoretical interaction can
be calculated according to the following equation (Figure 1).

Theoretical Section and Calculation
To achieve the objectives of this work, it is necessary to have
an innovative mixing model; this has been developed 1  where i is the solute, j is
the solvent, −ΔEmix(i,j) +
ΔEvapi + Vi(∂2dj + (∂2pj/2)) + niVj∂2hj/nj – ΔVi(∂2dj + 3/2RT/Vj) is the
experimental interaction energy, ΔEinterexp, ΔEmix(i,j) is the mixing energy
of solute i into solvent j, ΔEvap(i) is the vaporization energy of solute i, Vi(∂2dj + (∂2pj/2)) + niVj∂2hj/nj –
ΔVi(∂2dj + 3/2RT/Vj) is considered the cavity
formation energy or the disturbance energy of the solvent bulk due
to the presence of the solute, ΔEcav.

2Vi∂dj∂di + 2Vi∂pj∂pi + (EajEbi + CajCbi) + (EaiEbj + CaiCbj) is the theoretical interaction energy, ΔEintertheo, between solute i and solvent j, computable
using the six interaction parameters.

With these definitions being recalled, eq 1 becomes   2  

tert-Butanol was used as a solute, and the following
nine solvents were used: diethylether, i-propylether, n-butylether, triethylalamine, diethylamine, pyridine, dimethylformamide,
dimethylacetamide, and acetonitrile.

The bridge equation linking the Hansen’s parameter ∂h to Drago’s four parameters Ea, Eb, Ca, and Cb (ref (14)) was used 3  

From ref (18), the
nine mixing energies of tert-butanol −ΔEmix(i,j) in the nine-selected solvents were
obtained.

Hansen’s calculated vaporization energy of tert-butanol (ΔEvap), Hansen’s
cohesion parameters ∂d, ∂p, and
∂h (ref (19)), and Drago’s chemical interaction parameters17 for the nine-selected solvents were used.

Issue Regarding Drago’s Chemical Interaction Parameters
For the ten substances used in this study, the values of Drago’s
parameters, Ea, Ca, Eb, and Cb, are incomplete.17,20 A method for determining
the missing values needs to be proposed.

Determination of the Missing Values of Drago’s Parameters
First, it needs to be highlighted that the experimental method
proposed by Drago is not efficient enough to eliminate the polar contribution
of the chemical interaction energy. According to Drago’s ECW
model17  

However, according to our model,14 ΔH in fact must be  

This is because the apolar solvent used in the mixing process cannot
eliminate the polar contribution 2Vi∂pj∂pi from ΔH.

However, Drago gave the following expression for ΔH  

Then,  where W must be  

In this study, the following equation will be considered  

Therefore, the values of Drago’s parameters Ea, Eb, Ca, and Cb are over-estimated, and
they need to be corrected so that they can be reverted to the Hansen’s
scale.

The proposed correction method is the following. From the Drago–Wayland
parameters,21 methanol and ethanol were
chosen because the values of their four parameters are exceptionally
published (Table 4).

Table 4 Published Molar Volumes V (cm3/mol), Hansen’s Cohesive Parameters ∂h (cal1/2 cm–3/2) and Drago’s
Chemical Interaction Parameters Ea, Ca, Eb, and Cb (kcal1/2 mol–1/2) for Methanol and Ethanol

ethanol	58.5	9.51	2.65	1.34	0.69	1.85	1.10	3.24	
  

For methanol, (Hansen)/(Drago) = 2.43/2.78 = 0.87, the over estimation
is approximately 14%. For ethanol, (Hansen)/(Drago) = 2.65/3.24 =
0.82, the over estimation is approximately 22%.

Given that the errors for methanol and ethanol are 0.87 and 0.82,
respectively, the value of the correction factor will be the mean
value, 0.85.

Finally, we obtained  

Thus, using 0.92 as a correction factor, it is possible to obtain
the values of Drago’s parameters adapted to the Hansen’s
scale (Table 5).

Now, the equation V∂2h/n = (EaEb + CaCb) (kcal mol–1), with the values given in Table 5, is used to construct
ten equations, which are presented in Table 6.

Each of these equations has two unknowns, and they are Eb and Cb for tert-butanol and Ea and Ca for the nine solvents.

Substitute X1i = Ea for each of the nine chosen solvents and X1i = Eb for tert-butanol. In addition, substitute X2i = Ca for each of the nine chosen solvents
and X2i = Cb for tert-butanol in the ten equations.

Then, all of the ten equations shown in Table 6 having the two unknowns X1i and X2i can be represented
in the following form 4   5  

A graph of X1i as a function of X2i is given in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Graph of X1i as a function of X2i.

Any point on the straight line plotted in the above figure is a
solution of the equation  X1i = X1imax when X2i =
0, and X2i = X2imax when X1i = 0.

For tert-butanol, which is our target molecule,
the values of Eb and Cb must be in the following limits according to the equation
2.51 = 1.25Eb + 0.45Cb   6  

The most optimal case X1i = (9/10)X1imax has been chosen after having tested many
options to obtain solutions that respect these limits. Using X1i = (9/10)X1imax, it is possible to calculate all values of the variable X2i (Table 7).

The chemical bonding interaction has two parts 8   9   10  

Bonding between a solvent molecule and a solute molecule involves
eight parameters.

This combination of two molecules in turn gives two bonds, which
are given by eqs 9 and 10.

Using the values shown in Tables 5–7, it is possible to
calculate the different contributions of tert-butanol
and the nine-selected solvents to the theoretical interaction energy.

The addition of the published mixing energies and the vaporization
energy of the solute with the cavity formation energies allows us
to obtain the nine experimental energies of interaction between tert-butanol and the solvents (Table 10).

Overview of the Experiment Matrix to Be Used for Calculating
the Interaction Parameters of tert-Butanol
From Tables 7 and 10, the experiment matrix can be written as follows:     13  where (Y) represents the matrix column of experimental interaction energies,
(X) represents the experiment matrix, and (b) is the column matrix of coefficients to be calculated.

Ideally, the experiment matrix (X) must be orthogonal
so that the coefficients bi are independent.

Table 11 Presents a Comparison of Theoretical
and Experimental Values for the Interaction Energiesa

diethyl ether	14.20	13.67	3.73

of the experimental Einterexp = Yexp (kcal/mol) and calculated interaction energies Eintertheo = Ycal (kcal/mol) for the selected case X1i = 9/10Ximax.

However, in the case where the inflation factor (Table 12), F(bi), of each coefficient, bi is in the range of 1–10, (X) can
be used. Outside of this range, the coefficients bi are biased.22,23 The inflation factor, F(bi), of each coefficient, bi can be calculated according the following
equations 14  where 15  and

Calculation of the Six Interaction Parameters of the Target tert-Butanol
The multilinear regression when applied to the proposed experiment
matrix gives the experimental values for the six interaction parameters.
We can now compare these experimental values (Table 13) with the estimated values presented in Table 7.
