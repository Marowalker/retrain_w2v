An energy-transfer metal–organic
nanoprobe is designed for ratiometric sensing with dual response to
both peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and hypochlorite (ClO–). Here, a nanoscale metal–organic framework
(NMOF) acts as the energy donor and molecular probe as the acceptor
to construct a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosystem.
Biocompatible dextran conveniently binds to the NMOF surface through
multiple weak coordination interactions to improve water dispersibility
and cell uptake. Dextran can also coordinate with the molecular probe
with arylboronic acid group, which enables the convenient grafting
of molecular probes to the NMOF surface to construct energy-transfer
nanoprobes. Because of efficient FRET, the bright blue fluorescence
of NMOF is quenched, whereas red emission from the acceptor is enhanced.
Upon reacting with ONOO–, the probe departs from
NMOF and the fluorescence of NMOF is recovered because of the interruption
of FRET. When reacting with ClO–, the phenothiazine
moiety in the molecular probe is oxidized into phenothiazine-5-oxide,
which leads to more efficient energy transfer and the fluorescence
shifts from red to orange. The nanoprobes are also successfully applied
to the detection of ONOO– and ClO– in living cells.

Introduction
Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs), self-assembled from metal ions and organic ligands,
are considered as a novel family of materials with diverse and designable
structures. They have gained great attraction owing to their potential
applications in energy storage,1 gas adsorption,2,3 catalysis,4 separation,5 and so on. With the particle sizes of MOFs well controlled
to the nanoscale as nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs), they exhibit great potential
applications in bioimaging,6 drug delivery,7,8 photodynamic therapy,9,10 sensors,11,12 and so forth. NMOFs present a high synthetic flexibility because
the directional interactions between metal ions and ligands can be
systematically controlled and tuned. NMOFs also show intrinsic benefits
of the combination of metal ions and organic ligands. NMOFs with good
dimensions between 20 and 200 nm have been reported with regular or
some irregular shapes.13,14

Various kinds of surface
functionalization of the NMOFs could improve their stability and cell
internalization, as well as grafting biomolecules, which is a key
step toward biomedical applications.15,16 Proteins,17,18 DNA,19 peptides,20 and polymers21,22 are usually applied to functionalize
NMOFs. Dextran derived from the natural materials, with excellent
biocompatibility and water solubility, has been used as a matrix23,24 or functionalization material25 for NMOFs.
As the surface functionalization material, dextran could control the
interaction between nanoprobes and the analytes as biological media.
Here, we report a simple yet useful surface functionalization method
to form ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobes with dual response to both
peroxynitrite (ONOO–) and hypochlorite (ClO–).

Reactive oxygen species (ROSs) are essential
signaling molecules, which are implicated in various diseases, such
as autoimmunity disease, asthma, kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases,
and even cancers.26−28 Both ONOO– and ClO– are powerful natural oxidants that could react with proteins, DNA,
RNA, and other biomolecules and play important roles in physiology
and pathology in living system.29 The precise
roles of them in biological activities remain elusive, although they
are of great important. Thereby, the accurate and reliable analytical
methods to detect ONOO– and ClO– are necessary to elucidate their functions. In the past decades,
lots of fluorescence ROS sensors have been developed based on various
fluorophores, including fluorescein, rhodamine, coumarin, boron-dipyrromethene,
metal complexes,30,31 and so on. Ratiometric fluorescent
nanoprobes32−35 have the advantages of long-term tracking and good stability, and
they work through changes at two different wavelengths to increase
the dynamic ranges of the measurement, which is significant during
the detection in living cells.

In this work, the nanoprobe was
consisted of NMOF, the surface functionalization material (dextran),
and a small molecular probe (BPP). The arylboronate group from BPP
could react with ONOO– to form hydroxy derivatives,
and the phenothiazine group of BPP could be oxidized into phenothiazine-5-oxide36 after reacting with ClO– (Scheme 1). Dextran was selected
as a desired agent for NMOF surface functionalization and combination
with BPP. The proposed structures of dextran with BPP to form Dex-BPP
are shown in Scheme 1, which could bind with bis(boronates) in its pyranose form through
the 4-OH, 5-CH2OH, and 1,2-diols.37 In the meantime, the unreacted 1,2-diols of dextran could coat onto
the surface of NMOF through multiple weak coordination with metal
ions. After surface functionalization of Dex-BPP onto the NMOF, the
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was built using NMOF
as the donor and the BPP probe as the accepter. Upon reacting with
ONOO–, BPP detached from NMOF, resulting in the
interruption of the FRET between them. When the NMOF coating with
Dex-BPP named MD reacted with ClO–, compared with
the original BPP structure, the oxidized sulfoxide form showed higher
efficiency of the energy transfer. On the basis of the fluorescence
change of the FRET system, a ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe has
been demonstrated, which shows different responses to ONOO– and ClO–.

Scheme 1 Schematic of the Proposed Sensing
Mechanism of the NMOF Probe
Methods
Preparation of the NMOF Probe
Dextran
(0.2 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and mixed with the
BPP solution [1.55 mg of BPP in 5 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF)].
Triethylamine was used to adjust the pH of the solution to 8–9.
The coating reaction was carried out at room temperature overnight
to obtain the Dex-BPP solution. Meanwhile, NMOF was dispersed in DMF
(5 mL, 0.5 mg/mL) and mixed with 1 mL of the Dex-BPP solution and
continued to stir overnight. The MD product was collected by centrifugation
and then washed with DMF and water three times.

General Experiment
for ONOO– and ClO– Testing of
the NMOF Probe
The experiments of photophysical characterization
were carried out at room temperature. Absorption spectra (Shimadzu
UV-3600 spectrophotometer) and fluorescence spectra (Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer)
measurements were performed. The MD was dispersed in deionized water.
ONOO– was prepared by the reported methods,38 and ClO– was prepared by directly
diluting commercially available NaClO. To test the fluorescence responses
of the MD toward ONOO–, ClO–,
or other reactive agents, MD stock solutions were diluted with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and treated with desired concentration of analytes. The
fluorescence spectra under the excitation of 340 nm were measured
20 min after the addition of ROS. The emission spectra were scanned
from 360 to 650 nm.

Cell Culture and Imaging
The cytotoxicity
assay was carried out by using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT)
Cell Proliferation and Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime, China) against
Hela cells. The cervical cancer line Hela cells were kindly provided
by Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Macau. Hela cells were
incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
solution. All cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, a humidified environment. For imaging ONOO–,
Hela cells were seeded into glass-bottomed culture dishes and allowed
to adhere for 24 h.39,40 MD (10 mg/L) was added and incubated
for 30 min and then incubated with 1 mM ONOO– donor
SIN-1 for 30 min at 37 °C in the same medium. After the incubation,
cells were washed twice by using prewarm PBS buffer. Fixative solution
(Histochoice Mb Tissue Fixative, Amresco) was added for 15 min at
room temperature and then washed three times using PBS buffer. Cells
without SIN-1 were also employed as the control in the same process.
For imaging ClO–, HeLa cells were seeded into glass-bottomed
culture dishes and allowed to adhere for 24 h. MD (10 mg/L) was added
and incubated for 30 min, and then, 5 μM NaClO was added and
incubated for another 20 min. After the incubation, cells were treated
the same as before. The samples were observed by Carl Zeiss Confocal
LSM710.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
of the NMOF Probe
The NMOF probe was prepared according to
our previous work41 with some modification
as described in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 1a,b, the maximum absorption peak of NMOF was 340 nm and the emission
wavelength of NMOF was 410 nm. The molecular probe with the arylboronate
group and phenothiazine group was designed to sense ONOO– and ClO–, respectively, and the synthetic route
is shown in Scheme S1. The arylboronate
group could react with ONOO– to form hydroxy derivatives,
and divalent sulfur in the phenothiazine group could be oxidized into
sulfoxide36 by ClO–.
BPP showed weak fluorescence in polar medium because of the strong
intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). It was revealed that loading
molecules with strong ICT into pores of MOF or linking onto MOF surface
could enhance fluorescence because of the change of the polarity of
the local environment.41−43 In this nanoprobe system, as expected, efficient
energy transfer from the NMOF to the molecule BPP was observed after
a small amount of BPP was coated onto the surface of the NMOF. Upon
reacting with ONOO–, BPP detached from NMOF and
the FRET between them was destroyed, which led to the recovery of
NMOF fluorescence and the fading of the BPP fluorescence. When MD
reacted with ClO–, compared with the original BPP
structure, oxidized sulfoxide showed higher efficiency of the energy transfer.

lifetimes at 420 nm of NMOF (10 mg/L), MD (10 mg/L), MD (10 mg/L)
with 10.0 μM ONOO–, and MD (10 mg/L) with
10.0 μM ClO– excited under 340 nm.

In this system, dextran was applied as the role
of bridge between NMOF and BPP to form the FRET system as presented
in Scheme 1. The bare
NMOF showed a sole emission band at 410 nm, whereas MD presented two
emission peaks at 410 and 595 nm. The fluorescence at 595 nm was attributed
to the emission of BPP. The luminescence of BPP was difficult to be
efficiently excited by 340 nm light, which means that the emission
at 595 nm was resulted from FRET with energy transfer from the NMOF
to BPP as shown in Scheme 1. As presented in Figure 1c, the fluorescence spectra of NMOF partly overlapped
with the absorption spectra of BPP, BPP with ONOO–, and BPP with ClO–. In general, more overlap leads
to higher FRET efficiency. The FRET effect of MD, MD with ONOO–, and MD with ClO– could be directly
visualized by the naked eye (Figure 1d). Under the light of UV lamp of 365 nm, the NMOF
solution exhibited strong blue fluorescence, whereas MD exhibited
purple fluorescence because of the FRET effect. After reaction with
ONOO– and ClO–, respectively,
MD presented blue and orange fluorescence also because of the FRET
effect.

The energy-transfer efficiency [E =
(τD – τDA)/τD, where τD is the excited fluorescence lifetime
(FL) of donor] was studied, and the results are shown in Figure 1e. All samples were
excited by 340 nm light and FL at 410 nm was measured. The obtained
average FL of NMOF was 0.402 ns that decreased to 0.284 ns in MD.
The FRET efficiency was calculated as 29.35%. After reaction with
ONOO– and ClO–, respectively,
the lifetimes of MD were 0.314 and 0.186 ns. The FRET efficiencies
were 21.89 and 53.73% after reaction with ONOO– and
ClO–, respectively. The moderate energy-transfer
efficiencies are due to the overlapped area of the fluorescence spectra
of NMOF with the absorption spectra of the probe and the distance
between the NMOF and the probe.

The average particle sizes of
NMOF and MD were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) as shown
in Figure 2a,b. The
hydrodynamic diameters of NMOF and MD were 81.83 and 88.55 nm, respectively.
After coating Dex-BPP onto NMOF, the size was slightly increased without
apparent aggregation. Figure 2c,d shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
of NMOF and MD, which exhibited the morphologies of the nanoparticles
directly. NMOF and MD were well dispersed in aqueous solution with
the diameter of 60–120 nm. In the supporting information, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra results of NMOF and MD are shown
in Figure S5. After surface coating, the
structure of the NMOF was almost the same as before coating.

Ratiometric Fluorescence
Response of the Nanoprobe
The fluorescence responses of the
NMOF-based nanoprobe MD to ONOO– and ClO– were studied. MD emitted purple fluorescence with an emission peak
at 595 nm, which was consistent with the fluorescence of the BPP molecule.
Upon the addition of ONOO–, MD exhibited a hypsochromic
shift of the fluorescence spectra with isosbestic points at 515 nm
as shown in Figure 3a. With the increase of ONOO– concentration, the
emission peak of MD at 595 nm decreased in concert with an increase
of the blue band peaked at 410 nm. The ratio of the fluorescence intensities
of MD at 410 nm to 595 nm in Figure 3b linearly correlated with ONOO– concentration
from 0.00 to 1.00 μM, which indicated an accurate detection
limit. Upon the addition of ClO–, the emission peak
of MD at 570 nm increased with the increase of ClO– concentration; in the meantime, the band with blue color at 410
nm was kept stable as shown in Figure 3c. The ratio of the fluorescence intensities of MD
at 570 nm to 410 nm in Figure 3d also linearly correlates with ClO– concentration
from 0.00 to 10.00 μM. The results of the MD probe to ONOO– and ClO– corresponded to the sensing
mechanism as presented in Scheme 1. The photostability experiment was performed, and
the results are shown in Figure S6; the
emission curve showed almost no change after the illumination.

addition of various amounts of ONOO– (from 0.00
to 1.00 μM) in PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) for 30 min; (b)
linear correlation between the emission intensity ratio (F410nm/F595nm) and the ONOO– concentration; (c) fluorescence spectra of MD (1.0

0.00 to 10.00 μM) in PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) for 30 min;
and (d) linear correlation between the emission intensity ratio (F570nm/F410nm) and
the ClO– concentration.

To evaluate the selectivity of MD to ONOO– and ClO–, the MD probe was reacted with common
ROSs and metal ions, including ONOO–, ClO–, H2O2, NO•, OH•, 1O2, t-BuOOH, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+. The fluorescence spectra
are shown in Figure 4a; ONOO– and ClO– caused obvious
ratiometric fluorescent response of the spectra. Furthermore, other
ROSs and metal ions could not promote an apparent change in the MD
spectra when present in 10 equivalent excess. The fluorescence intensity
ratios F410nm/F595nm of MD to ONOO– and F570nm/F410nm of MD to ClO– as shown in Figure 4b,c in contrast to other samples were enhanced about 5 times and
2 times, respectively. These results indicated that MD displayed selectivity
toward ONOO– and ClO– to other
common ROSs.

7.4) upon addition of various ROSs (a). Corresponding fluorescence
intensity ratios (F410nm/F595nm) of MD to ONOO– (b) and (F570nm/F410nm) of
MD to ClO– (c) in PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4) upon
addition of various ROSs.

MTT cell viability assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity
of MD, and the results showed that MD has low toxicity. The desirable
fluorescence properties of MD for ONOO– and ClO– prompted us to utilize it for detection of intracellular
ONOO– or ClO–. As shown in Figure 5a, when Hela cells
were incubated with MD, they exhibited red fluorescence, which means
that MD was cell-permeable and still had the FRET effect in cells.
When the Hela cells were treated with SIN-1, the red fluorescence
was quenched and the blue fluorescence of NMOF was recovered as presented
in Figure 5b, indicating
that MD could image the intracellular ONOO– with
dual color switching. After being treated with NaClO (5 μM)
for 20 min, intense yellow fluorescence emerged in the cells in Figure 5c. The merged cell
pictures in Figure 5 confirmed that the fluorescence signals were just located in the
intracellular area. The good cell membrane permeability and significant
dual color switching enabled MD as an excellent nanoprobe for ratiometric
detection of ONOO– and ClO–.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a novel
metal–organic nanoprobe for ratiometric sensing with dual response
to both ONOO– and ClO– through
FRET. Dextran is introduced to conveniently bind to the surface of
the energy donor NMOF and combine with the energy acceptor molecular
probe. This nanoprobe exhibits excellent photostability, high brightness,
good water solubility, and cell internalization, which is successfully
applied to the detection of ONOO– and ClO– in living cells with different two-color switches. The novel probe
is a promising tool for the investigations of ONOO–- and ClO–-related diseases. The design strategy
of energy-transfer nanoprobes presented herein might be extended to
construct other ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobes for a variety of
applications.
