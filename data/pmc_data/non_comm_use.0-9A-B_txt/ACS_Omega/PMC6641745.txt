This
study unveils palladium-catalyzed intramolecular oxidative
cyclizations in biaryl and
heterobiaryl sulfones providing direct access to fused biaryl sulfones
(dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxides). Variously substituted dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxides
could be readily prepared in good to excellent yields under optimized
conditions. In addition, bromination afforded dibromo derivative of
dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxides, providing platform for late-stage diversification.
The translational applications of this current protocol have successfully
been demonstrated in the synthesis of 2,8-diamino derivative of dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxides,
a α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist analogue,
and novel single fluorene-tethered dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide, an
organic emitter.

Introduction
Dibenzothiophene
dioxides behold a great significance owing to
their prospective pharmaceutical importance as agonists of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in neurological disorders,1a,1b and wide application in functional materials as bipolar host materials,
avidly studied for use in high-performing PhOLEDs (Figure 1).1c−1e Recently, Yorimitsu
and Osuka have rationally extended the substrate scope of dibenzothiophene
dioxides through “aromatic metamorphosis” to achieve
a variety of spirocyclic molecules.1f,1g

heterocycles.

Among the emerging alternatives
in the frontline of palladium-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions, cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) is
a very promising method, which avoids the use of functionalized substrates
and is a more atom-economic and environmentally friendly method.2 The mechanistic investigations have revealed
that the catalytic transformations at arene, heteroarene, and alkene
C(sp2)–H bonds, especially the reactivity of C(sp2)–H bonds adjacent to heteroatoms, could be tuned to
allow intramolecular arylation under Pd catalysis.2c It is noteworthy that oxidative biaryl coupling reactions
extensively constituting the central building blocks have radically
emerged as a tool to synthesize heterocyclic scaffolds, viz., xanthones,
carbazoles, dibenzofuran, cyclized benzanilides, isoquinoline polyheteroaromatic
compounds, etc.2g,3

Several classical methods
have been reported for the synthesis
of fused biaryl sulfones 1 (Scheme 1). These methods include oxidation of dibenzothiophene
and multistep procedures, as well as require halogenated and metalated
compounds.4 Undoubtedly, the seminal intramolecular
oxidative coupling via effective directing strategy for single C–H
bond activation from simple precursors requires minimum prefunctionalization
for expedite access to fused biaryl sulfones. However, current chemistry
has not been successful to reach this goal; mainly due to weak coordinating
properties of sulfone group.5 However,
2-pyridyl(sulfone) has found myriad of applications in directing group-assisted
C–H functionalization processes principally due to heterocyclic
coordination group.6

Scheme 1 Approaches to Fused
Biaryl Sulfones
Only two reports surfaced
utilizing sulfone as effective directing
group: (a) Rh-catalyzed ortho-alkenylation of phenyl
sulfones7a and (b) Ni-catalyzed Suzuki
reaction of unactivated alkyl electrophiles;7b although the use of Pd catalyst is hitherto unknown, its application
in the synthesis of fused biaryl sulfones remains unexplored (to the
best of our knowledge). In consequence of our long-standing interest
in the concise synthesis of fused heterocycles via intramolecular
oxidative cyclization of two C(sp2) C–H bonds,8 we conceived that an external ligand could assist
sulfone in C–H bond activation.9 Herein, we describe (1) the establishment of a Pd-catalyzed intramolecular
oxidative arylation reaction at ortho positions adjacent
to sulfone group in biaryl sulfones; (2) the challenging regioselective
cyclization of otherwise low-reactive action partners; (3) the rare
example of intramolecular oxidative cyclization of heterobiaryl sulfones
to synthesize decorated sulfone-containing motifs; and (4) incorporation
of fluorene backbone to design single fluorene molecule-based organic
emitters.

Results and Discussion
Our initial investigation started
by choosing 1-methyl-4-(phenylsulfonyl)benzene
(4a) as the model substrate, and we began our endeavor
for intramolecular oxidative cyclization. The reaction of 4a with Pd(OAc)2 in the presence of Cu(OAc)2 as
oxidant in pivalic acid did not afford our desired product (Table 1, entry 1). The screening
of various oxidants yielded 5a either in low yields or
no product formation (entries 2–5). Addition of PPh3 (20 mol %) along with Pd(OAc)2 (10 mol %) and AgOAc (3
equiv) in pivalic acid at 130 °C for 24 h furnished 5a in 52% isolated yield (86% based on recovery of starting material)
(entry 6). Further reducing the molar quantity of oxidant (entries
7 and 8) or changing the ligand (entries 9 and 10) failed to improve
the yields. The use of Ag2CO3 (3 equiv) proved
detrimental, giving 5a in low yield (entry 11). Changing
the catalyst to palladium pivalate (10 mol %) also gave 5a in 23% yield (entry 12). However, use of a precatalyst produced
inferior result (entry 13).

With the optimized
reaction condition in hand, we began to explore
the substrates that could participate in this protocol. The variously
substituted biaryl sulfones were readily prepared either from the
corresponding arenes using K2S2O810a or via dehydration of p-toluene sulfonic acid and the arenes using Eaton’s reagent10b (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Preparation of Substrates
Next, we investigated intramolecular oxidative C–C
bond
formation through Pd-catalyzed cyclization of the resulting substrates.
The optimized condition was successfully employed for the synthesis
of a variety of annelated sulfone-containing cyclic compounds (Scheme 3). The substitutions para- to sulfone group were well tolerated, giving the desired
products in good yields (5c–e). The
substrate bearing an electron-withdrawing group meta- to sulfone also underwent cyclization (5f) under the
optimized condition, albeit in reduced yield, exhibiting a relatively
low reactivity. To our delight, disubstituted arenes (4g–j) also furnished the desired products (5g–j) except in the case of 1,4-disubstituted
biaryl sulfones (4k,l) possibly due to the
accountable steric hindrance.

Scheme 3 Substrate Scope for Intramolecular
Oxidative Cyclization of Biaryl
Sulfones
Interestingly, in
the case of 4m containing a naphthyl
ring, cyclization was observed at both the ortho-
positions, affording a (1:1) mixture of regioisomers (5ma:5mb). The central challenge
of this study was to identify an optimized condition, which yielded
a coherent synthesis of the fused biaryl sulfones. Next, we focused
our efforts to attempt oxidative cyclization of heteroaryl sulfones
under our developed protocol (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Substrate Scope for Intramolecular Oxidative Cyclization
of Heterobiaryl
Sulfones
The optimized condition
was then employed to variously substituted
(phenylsulfonyl)pyridines; 2- and 4-(phenylsulfonyl)pyridine (4n and 4p, respectively) did not furnish the
desired products, and the starting materials were recovered unreacted.
However 3-(phenylsulfonyl)pyridine (4o) afforded the
product 5o in good yield, offering exclusive C-2 oxidative
arylation on pyridine. The difficulty in intramolecular oxidative
C–H palladation in 4n and 4p could
result in these unfavorable results. Noteworthy here was the fact
that 3-[(2,4-dimethylphenyl)sulfonyl]thiophene (4q) furnished
homocoupled product (5qb), mainly due to C–H
activation at C-5 of thiophene. The attempts to block the C-5 position
of thiophene by deliberate choice of 3-(phenylsulfonyl)benzo[b]thiophene (4r) resulted in the anticipated
intramolecular oxidative cyclization furnishing excellent yield of
desired product (5r). Pleasingly, 3-tosyl-1H-indole (4s), and 1-ethyl-3-tosyl-1H-indole (4t) successfully afforded the coupled products
under our protocol in good to excellent yields. Surprisingly however, N-(5-(phenylsulfonyl)quinolin-8-yl)acetamide (4u) bearing phenyl sulfone on the aromatic counterpart of substituted
quinoline failed to furnish the desired product (5u).
On comparison of the reactivity of these heterocycles, both electron-deficient
and electron-rich rings were well tolerated under our optimized condition.
However, an electron-deficient 3-pyridyl substrate demonstrated a
slightly low reactivity compared to electron-rich 3-thienyl or 3-indolyl
substrate. On the other hand, 3-pyridyl substrate underwent slow intramolecular
oxidative arylation, whereas 2- and 4-pyridyl substrates are unreactive
under the condition. The key distinctive feature of the protocol here
was the ability to afford fused heterobiaryl sulfones in excellent
yields.

Next, our motive was to gain further insights into the
translational
applications of our newly developed protocol. The titled approach
was successfully utilized for the synthesis of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist analogue1a,1b (5v) in moderate yield (Scheme 5, eq 1). Also, bromination of 5a afforded dibrominated product (5wa), providing
a synthetic handle for late-stage diversification, and thereby successfully
underwent Suzuki reaction to afford diarylated product (5wb) (Scheme 5, eq 2). To explore further the photochromic properties of the synthesized
molecule, we prepared fluorene-based organic molecule 5x (Scheme 5, eq 3).
The fluorene backbone was first tethered to the substrate (4w) containing a bromo handle under Suzuki conditions, resulting in
the formation of precursor (4x), which when subjected
to optimized conditions gave, unlike literature reports, a single
fluorene-based organic emitter tethered to fused biaryl sulfones (5x) in moderate yield.

Scheme 5 Translational Applications of Fused
Biaryl Sulfones
The photophysical
properties, such as emission spectrum of compound 5x (see Figure 2), reveal that the
compound could be a promising organic emitter
for further exploration in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs).
The operational simplicity to prepare the molecules of biological,
synthetic, and photochromic importance is the central feature of this
study.

To further elucidate the reaction mechanism, we have
carried out
a control experiment, wherein the substrate 1-(benzylsulfonyl)-4-methylbenzene
(4y) (eq 4) when subjected to our optimized condition failed to furnish the
desired cyclized product (5y) and the starting material
was recovered, suggesting the unfavorable ortho C–H
palladation in the benzyl ring because of poor coordination of the
sulfonyl group. 4  Thus, on the basis of our previous experiences8 and literature precedence,9 we propose a plausible mechanism for this intramolecular
oxidative cyclization, as depicted in Scheme 6. The palladation of ortho- C–H bond in 4b could result in the formation
of transient intermediate II, which upon subsequent cyclopalladation
could lead to the formation of intermediate III. The
transmetallation by concerted metalation-deprotonation pathway could
form IV, which upon reductive elimination could give 5b with concomitant formation of palladium (0).

Scheme 6 Plausible
Mechanism of Intramolecular Cyclization in Biaryl Sulfones
In conclusion, we have developed
a novel approach for the intramolecular
oxidative arylations in biaryl sulfones, providing a direct access
to variously substituted dibenzothiophene dioxides. Our protocol also
proved beneficial for the synthesis of fused heterobiaryl sulfones
with complete regioselectivity. A new opportunity in the design and
synthesis of single fluorene-based organic emitters tethered with
biaryl sulfones is demonstrated in the preparation of fused polycyclic
tethered fluorenes.

Experimental Section
General Methods
Unless noted otherwise, all reagents

All palladium-catalyzed reactions were performed in a screw-cap sealed
tube. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in
CDCl3 as solvent using a 400 MHz spectrometer with Me4Si as an internal standard. Coupling constants (J values) are reported in hertz (Hz). Column chromatography was performed
using silica gel (100–200 mesh). High-resolution mass spectra
(HRMS) were obtained using the electrospray ionization (ESI) technique
and as time-of-flight mass analyzer. All melting points were taken
using a melting-point apparatus equipped with a calibrated thermometer
and are uncorrected. New compounds were characterized by melting point,
IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS data.
