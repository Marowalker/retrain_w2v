With the purpose to explore the relationship
between deoxynivalenol
(DON)-induced apoptosis and autophagy and provide mechanistic explanations
for the toxic effects of DON on IPEC-J2 cells, we determined the cell
viability, cell morphology, apoptosis, and autophagy by using autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002,
and activator 740Y-P. It turned out that 3-MA was able to attenuate
the reduction of cell viability induced by DON. Moreover, 3-MA was
capable of upregulating the expression of DON-induced autophagic protein
p62 and downregulating the expressions of DON-induced autophagic protein
LC3-II and apoptotic protein Bax, suggesting that autophagy is a driving
mechanism for this apoptotic induction. The results of Annexin V-FITC/PI
double staining indicated that DON could induce apoptosis by inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Subsequently, it was further
confirmed by Western blot analysis that DON significantly decreased
expressions of P-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR, and autophagic protein p62,
and increased expression of autophagy-related protein LC3-II, suggesting
that DON triggered autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
pathway. To conclude, these data reveal that DON may induce cytotoxicity
and apoptosis through the activation of autophagy by suppressing the
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. This study provides new insights
into the mechanisms by which DON incurs cytotoxic effects.

==== Body
Introduction
The issue of deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination
of food has received
considerable critical attention. DON, commonly known as vomitoxin,
is a secondary metabolite of Fusarium contaminating various crops and feeds.1 In the molecule of DON (Figure 1), the C9/C10 double bond, epoxy group on C12/C13,
and the free hydroxyl group are the main reasons for DON toxicity.2,3 The contamination of food by DON can be carried out before the processing,
production, storage, transportation, sale of food, or through the
food chain.

Figure 1 Structural formula of DON.

The gastrointestinal tract is the first barrier against external
pollutants and pathogens.4,5 The intact mucosal barrier
of the small intestine is an essential basis for ensuring intestinal
health. Functional tight junctions between small intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs) are prerequisites for maintaining the normal barrier
function and absorption function of the small intestinal mucosa.6 IECs would quickly absorb DON of high concentrations
when exposed to contaminated feed or food.7−9 Many in vivo
and in vitro research studies have demonstrated that DON obstructs
IECs function through regulating cell proliferation and activity and
impairing intestinal barrier function.7,10,11 Tang et al. found that DON reduced the activity of
IPEC-J2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.12 At the molecular level, DON causes toxic ribosome stress,
induces MAPK phosphorylation, promotes apoptosis, induces changes
in oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses, and reduces the expression
of cell adhesion proteins.13,14 Moreover, our previous
study found that DON can induce autophagy in addition to inducing
apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells.15

Autophagy
manifests a duality with respect to the regulation of
cell death: under normal physiological conditions, to some degree,
autophagy protects cells from harmful conditions to improve cell survival.16 On the other hand, excessive autophagy could
cause programmed cell death, which is named as autophagy-mediated
cell death.17 Apoptosis and autophagy are
crucial to maintaining the homeostasis of the internal environment
and healthy growth.18,19 Numerous studies have found that
autophagy and apoptosis were regulated by PI3K-AKT,20 p38 MAPK,21 JNK,22 and AMPK.23,24 In a recent study,
DON induced autophagy and apoptosis in porcine oocytes.25

Prior studies have noted the importance
of PI3K-AKT signaling pathway,
which belongs to one of the classical pathways of negative regulation
on autophagy.26 PI3K exists in the cytoplasm,
including type I (PI3KCI), type II (PI3KCII), and type III (PI3KCIII).
Currently, it is found that PI3KCI and PI3KCIII are involved in the
regulation of autophagy. PI3KCI is phosphorylated by external stimulation,
afterward activating AKT.27,28 PI3KCI can be inhibited
and activated by LY294002 and 740Y-P, respectively, playing an important
role in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.29,30 PI3KCIII is
capable of positively regulating autophagy but can be inhibited by
3-methyladenine (3-MA), thus suppressing the formation of pre-autophagosome.31 Zhang et al. confirmed the association of JAK/STAT,
p38 MAPK, and PI3K/AKT pathways with DON-induced enteric toxicity.5

As mentioned above, DON can induce autophagy
and apoptosis in different
cell lines, but the questions remain open as to figuring out the mechanism
of DON-induced autophagy and whether DON-induced apoptosis and autophagy
may be related to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in IPEC-J2 cells.
To this end, the objective of the present study was to explore the
relationship between apoptosis and autophagy induced by DON in IPEC-J2
cells, which were employed as an in vitro model of toxicity assay.
We also wanted to confirm whether DON may activate autophagy by inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in IPEC-J2 cells. This report will give
a new perception to DON-induced cytotoxicity.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
and Cell Culture
Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
and DON were kindly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp (St. Louis,
MO, USA). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) was obtained from Promega (Madison,
WI, USA). Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit was bought from DOJINDO
(Shanghai, China). The main antibodies against Bax, p62, LC3, AKT,
mTOR, and GAPDH and HRP-linked antibody were acquired from Servicebio
(Wuhan, China). Primary antibodies against p-AKT and p-mTOR were obtained
from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Jiangsu province,
China). 740Y-P was purchased from APEXBIO (Shanghai, China). LY294002
was purchased from TargetMol (Shanghai, China). 3-MA was purchased
from Selleckchem (Houston, TX). IPEC-J2 cells were procured from Biochemy
(Wuhan, China) and preserved in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) incorporating 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco Invitrogen),
50 μg/mL penicillin and 10% fetal bovine serum.

Design of Experiments
After being inoculated in a 96-well
plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well, the IPEC-J2
cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h under a humidified circumstance
containing 5% CO2. The untreated fresh cells were designated
as the control group, and the cells being exposed to DON of different
concentrations (1, 2, 4 and 8 μM) for a period of time (4–48
h) were referred to as the DON group. The 3-MA group was the cells
treated with a combination (DON + 3-MA) of 1 μM DON and 3-MA
(5 mM). The 740Y-P group was the cells treated with a combination
(DON + 740Y-P) of 1 μM DON and 740Y-P (20 μM). The LY294002
group was the cells treated with a combination (DON + LY294002) of
1 μM DON and LY294002 (10 μM).

The DMSO stored at
−20 °C was used to prepare stock solutions of 10 mM DON,
740Y-P, and LY294002, separately. A 100 mM 3-MA stock solution was
prepared using DMEM stored at −20 °C. For each experiment,
DMEM medium was used to further dilute 10 mM DON stock solutions to
acquire various required concentrations of DON. All of the cells underwent
4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h of treatment with DON.

Cell Viability Assay
After treatment with DON, 3-MA,
LY294002, and 740Y-P at 37 °C for different durations (4–48
h) in a CO2 incubator, the MTS method15 was used to determine cell viability in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions (Biochemy). Afterward, absorbance
was examined via a microplate reader at 490 nm (Thermomax).

Observation
of Cell Morphology by the Inverted Microscope
After IPEC-J2
cells were treated by DON, 3-MA, LY294002, and 740Y-P
for 12 h, changes in cell morphology were observed at 100-fold magnification
with an inverted microscope (Wuhan, China), and then the obtained
images were taken with a digital camera.

Detection of Apoptosis
by the Fluorescent Microscope
IPEC-J2 cells were double-stained
with Annexin V-FITC (DOJINDO, Shanghai,
China) and PI for detection of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/dead
cells, respectively. In brief, after IPEC-J2 cells were treated by
DON, 3-MA, LY294002, and 740Y-P, the cells of equal amount were collected
and stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI at room temperature in the
dark for 15 min, followed by observation of fluorescence intensity
with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Japan). The specific experimental
procedure was carried out following the instructions of the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit.

Western Blot Assay
Western blot was carried out as
described previously.15,32 Briefly, the mixtures of 3-MA
(5 mM), 740Y-P (20 μM) and LY294002 (10 μM) and DON were
used to treat IPEC-J2 cells for 8, 12, and 24 h, respectively, in
culture dishes with an area of 25 cm2. Then, complete protease
inhibitor cocktail was applied to extract the total protein in ice-cold
lysis buffer after 10 min lysis for all samples. As described previously,
immunoblotting assays were adopted to determine GAPDH, the polyubiquitin-binding
protein p62, the autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3), p-AKT, p-mTOR,
AKT, and mTOR. An imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA) was used to scan the
obtained blots. After that, ImageJ software (Image Processing and
Analysis in Java; NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) was utilized to quantify
the intensity of protein by integrating densities.

Statistical
Analysis
All of the data in this study
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons of statistical
differences among groups were analyzed via the T-test (Graph-Pad Prism
7 software). P < 0.05 means the differences were
significant. P < 0.01 means the differences were
highly significant. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate (n = 3).

Results
Cytotoxicity of DON
The effect of DON on cell activity
was measured via MTS assay. As can be seen from Figure 2, the activity of cells decreased apparently
with both the increase of DON concentration (1–8 μM)
and the prolongation of DON exposure time (4–48 h), which is
consistent with the trend obtained from the study of Tang12 by treating IPEC-J2 cells with DON of different
concentrations (1, 2 μg/mL) for different durations (0–4
d). From the perspective of the cell survival rate, it can be seen
from the experiment that DON attenuated the activity of IPEC-J2 cells
and produced cytotoxicity to the cells even at low dosage. Given that
when treated with DON for 12 h, the IC20 value of DON was
around 1 μM (0.279 μg/mL), herein, 1 μM DON was
employed to conduct follow-up experiments.

IPEC-J2 cells treated with DON of various
concentrations. IPEC-J2 cells were treated with DON of various concentrations
(1, 2, 4, 8 μM) for 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h.

Effect of Autophagy Inhibitor 3-MA on DON Cytotoxicity
Figure 3 manifests
the effect of 3-MA on the cytotoxicity induced by DON to IPEC-J2 cells
on the aspects of cell activity and morphology. In the control group,
the IPEC-J2 cells were firmly connected and plump, possessing well-proportioned
size and shape and filling the entire field of view (Figure 3A). Compared with the control
group, after 12 h exposure to DON, IPEC-J2 cells showed a decrease
in cell density and the cell morphology was stretched. In addition,
the convex structure gradually decreased, and the cell membrane became
fuzzy (Figure 3B).
The results revealed that DON caused damage to IPEC-J2 cells. After
12 h, cells became more homogeneous in the 3-MA group compared to
the DON group (Figure 3C). There may be considerable that cell damage caused by DON might
be associated with DON-induced autophagy. In contrast with the control
group, exposure to DON for 12 h resulted in a remarkable decrease
in the activity of IPEC-J2 cells, contrary to the result of co-treatment
with 3-MA and DON when compared with the DON group (Figure 3D), suggesting that the cytotoxicity
of DON may be related to DON-induced autophagy.

Effect of 3-MA on DON-Induced Autophagy
The autophagy
inhibitor (3-MA) was also used to treat DON-injured IPEC-J2 cells
to corroborate that DON exposure induces apoptosis and autophagy.
Subsequently, the effect of 3-MA on the expressions of autophagy-related
proteins was detected by the Western blot to verify whether DON-induced
autophagy could be intervened after treating IPEC-J2 cells with 5
mM 3-MA for 12 h. The results are shown in Figure 4. Compared with the control group, exposure
to DON for 12 h significantly upregulated the expression of autophagic
protein LC3-II as well as downregulated the expression of protein
p62, indicating that DON-induced autophagy, as reported by Han.25 The differences between the 3-MA-treated culture
and positive controls were that 3-MA significantly upregulated the
expression of protein p62 and downregulated the expression of LC3-II,
indicating that 3-MA notably reversed the autophagy induction of DON.
The above results show that DON-induced autophagy, which was blocked
by 3-MA.

Effect of 3-MA on DON-Induced Apoptosis
With the aim
of investigating the relationship between DON-induced apoptosis and
autophagy, we further investigated the effect of 3-MA on apoptosis
and the expression of apoptosis-related protein. IPEC-J2 cells were
double-stained with Annexin V-FITC and PI for detection of early apoptotic
and late apoptotic/dead cells, respectively, and quantitative analysis
in terms of fluorescence intensity (positively correlated with the
degree of apoptosis) was carried out by applying ImageJ software.
As is depicted in Figure 5C, compared with the negative control, the fluorescence intensity
was significantly increased for 12 h DON exposure, suggesting the
apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells because of the induction of DON. On the
contrary, compared with the DON group, co-treating IPEC-J2 cells with
3-MA and DON for 12 h presented an opposite result, illustrating that
DON may induce apoptosis by activating autophagy. The results of the
effect of 3-MA on the expression of apoptosis-related protein Bax
with Bax/GAPDH representing the degree of apoptosis (positively correlated
with the content of Bax) were presented in Figure 5D. In comparison with the control group,
12 h DON exposure significantly upregulated the expression of apoptotic
protein Bax, which indicated that DON induced apoptosis. The addition
of 3-MA significantly downregulated the expression of apoptotic protein
Bax as compared with the DON group, suggesting that 3-MA significantly
prevented apoptosis induced by DON. These results indicated that DON-induced
autophagy promotes apoptosis, and DON may induce apoptosis by triggering
excessive autophagy. In conclusion, DON-induced autophagy and apoptosis
are responsible for the decline in the quality of IPEC-J2 cells.

Effects of PI3K Pathway Inhibitor and Activator on the Morphology
and Activity of DON-Injured Cells
It has been documented
that the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway is one of the classical pathways
for negatively regulating autophagy. To further investigate the mechanism
of DON-induced autophagy, DON and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway activator
or inhibitor were selected to co-treat IPEC-J2 cells for 12 h and
then the effects on cell activity and morphology were observed to
preliminarily verify the mechanism that DON induced autophagy. The
results are shown in Figure 6. In the control group, the IPEC-J2 cells were firmly connected
and plump, having well-proportioned size and shape and filling the
entire field of view (Figure 6A). After exposure to DON for 12 h, by comparison with the
control group, IPEC-J2 cells showed a reduction in cell density and
the cell morphology was stretched with the convex structure decreased,
and the cell membrane became fuzzy (Figure 6B). The results showed that DON caused damage
to IPEC-J2 cells. After co-treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002
and DON for 12 h, compared with the DON group, branching appeared
around the cell and the cell deformity was more acute. What is worse,
the gap between cells became larger and the intercellular connection
and original morphology were lost. After co-treatment with PI3K activator
740Y-P and DON for 12 h, in comparison to the DON group, the cell
density became larger and the cell morphology was restored to a certain
extent. Meanwhile, compared with the DON group, cell activity was
significantly decreased (P < 0.05) after treatment
with LY294002 and DON for 12 h, which was opposite to the result of
co-treatment with 740Y-P and DON. The results suggest that DON may
regulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and the cytotoxicity of DON may
be related to DON-induced autophagy and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.

Effects of PI3K Pathway Inhibitor and Activator on DON-Induced
Apoptosis
IPEC-J2 cells were double-stained with Annexin
V-FITC and PI for detection of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/dead
cells, respectively, and ImageJ software was used to perform quantitative
analysis in terms of fluorescence intensity to evaluate the effects
of PI3K pathway inhibitor LY294002 and activator 740Y-P on DON-induced
apoptosis, with the aim of exploring the effect of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway on DON-induced apoptosis. Figure 7B shows the sum of fluorescence intensity
of early apoptotic and late apoptotic/dead cells measured by a fluorescence
microscope. As can be seen from Figure 7B, compared with the control group, 12 h treatment
with DON made the fluorescence intensity significantly increased,
indicating that DON induced apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells. After co-treating
IPEC-J2 cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and DON for 12 h, the fluorescence
intensity was significantly enhanced when contrasted with the DON
group, contrary to the results of co-treatment with DON and PI3K activator
740Y-P. The results indicate that DON may induce apoptosis by inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway.

PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway is Involved in DON-Induced Autophagy
The expression results of autophagy-related and the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
pathway-related proteins (p-mTOR, mTOR, p-AKT and AKT proteins) with
treatment of IPEC-J2 cells by PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitor LY294002
and activator 740Y-P are shown in Figure 8. After 12 h treatment of IPEC-J2 with DON,
compared with untreated cells, the autophagy-related protein LC3-II
was significantly increased, besides, p62 protein and both p-mTOR/mTOR
and p-AKT/AKT significantly decreased. After co-treating IPEC-J2 cells
with DON and LY294002 for 12 h, compared with the DON group, the autophagy-related
protein LC3-II was upregulated, p62 protein expression was significantly
downregulated, and both p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT were downregulated,
the results of which were opposite to that of co-treatment with 740Y-P
and DON. These results indicate that DON induces autophagy by inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT pathway, that is, the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway is involved
in DON-induced autophagy.

Discussion
DON is the most prevalent mycotoxin, whose contamination
to food
and feed is a severe worldwide problem. The contamination level of
DON in cereals reaches to about 1.2–19 mg/kg.33−35 The gastrointestinal tract is the first barrier against external
pollutants and pathogens, playing a pivotal role in local and systemic
immune responses.4,5 Many in vivo and in vitro research
studies have demonstrated that DON affects IEC function by egulating
cell proliferation and activity, as well as jeopardizing intestinal
barrier function.7,10,11 As a result, for human and animal, the ingestion of DON-contaminated
cereals would incur impacts of different degrees on the health of
the body. Therefore, IPEC-J2 cells were selected as cell models to
further study on toxicological effects of DON. In this study, IPEC-J2
cells were treated with DON of various concentrations for different
durations and it was found that DON reduced cell activity in a time-
and dose-dependent manner. Considering that when treated with DON
for 12 h, the cell activity was significantly inhibited and the IC20 value of DON was about 1 μM (0.279 μg/mL), therefore,
1 μM DON was used to conduct subsequent experiments.

The
levels of LC3-II and p62 were positively36 and negatively correlated37 with
the degree of autophagy, respectively. Generally, there are two indicators,
namely, LC3-II/internal reference (GAPDH) and LC3-II/LC3-I values,
for semiquantitatively reflecting the degree of autophagy by Western
blot. At present, the epitopes detected by the LC3 antibody are located
at the N-terminal of LC3. However, because the binding of the PE group
may cause a conformational change in the N-terminal region, the LC3
antibody has a stronger affinity for LC3-II than LC3-I and is prone
to false positive. Therefore, this experiment utilized LC3-II/GAPDH
to represent the degree of autophagy. Bax is a pro-apoptotic protein
which is one of the typical proteins of apoptosis. Accordingly, we
chose LC3-II and p62 proteins as markers of autophagy and Bax protein
as a marker of apoptosis.

Autophagy, called as “self-eating”,
is a conservative
way of cell self-degradation, which is a process of degradation and
reuse of damaged organelles and macromolecules through lysosomes.
Apoptosis, called as “self-killing”, is an autonomous
process of cell death in order to maintain homeostasis.38 Autophagy and apoptosis are key factors regulating
cell death, and the relationship between them is complex and even
conflicting.39 On the one hand, autophagy
acts as a protective mechanism against cell apoptosis and alleviates
cell death, on the other hand, autophagy acts as a damage mechanism
to accelerate cell apoptosis and promote cell death.40 To investigate the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy
induced by DON, we determined the cell viability, apoptosis, and autophagy
after treating IPEC-J2 cells with 3-MA and DON for 12 h. 3-MA were
used for blocking the autophagy induced by DON. It turned out that
DON upregulated the expression of autophagy-related protein LC3-II,
downregulated p62 protein expression, and upregulated Bax protein
expression, indicating that DON induced autophagy and apoptosis. 3-MA,
autophagy inhibitor, significantly downregulated the expressions of
both autophagic protein LC3-II and apoptotic protein Bax and upregulated
the expression of p62 protein in DON-injured IPEC-J2 cells, indicating
that 3-MA could suppress the apoptosis and autophagy and alleviate
the cell damage induced by DON. These results demonstrated that autophagy
induced by DON was essential to apoptotic cell damage, and inhibition
of autophagy could weaken DON-induced apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells.
DON-induced autophagy and apoptosis are the reasons for the decline
in the quality of IPEC-J2 cells. These results are consistent with
the notion that Han et al. treated porcine oocytes with DON and found
that DON induced autophagy/apoptosis in porcine oocytes.25

However, there is little information to
understand how the DON-induced
autophagy and apoptosis at the cellular level. Previous research studies
have shown that autophagy and apoptosis were related to oxidative
stress induced by DON.41−43 DON-dependent ROS production has been confirmed in
vitro test, and the effect of DON (25–250 ng/mL) on the generation
of NO is negligible.44 ROS could induce
autophagy and apoptosis by regulating PI3K-AKT,20 p38 MAPK,21 JNK,22 and AMPK.23,24 Zhang et al.5 confirmed the association of JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK,
and PI3K/AKT pathways with enteric toxicity induced by DON. Therefore,
we speculated that the cytotoxic mechanism exhibited by DON is highly
correlated with the fact that DON induced autophagy by regulating
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thereby inducing apoptosis.

To verify
this hypothesis, we first studied the effects of DON
on autophagy and apoptosis pathways and the relationship between them
in IPEC-J2 cells. Subsequently, the regulation of DON on the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
signaling was confirmed. Finally, the link between autophagy and the
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway was investigated. The results showed
that the 3-MA and PI3K activator 740Y-P significantly increased the
activity of DON-injured cells, effectively restored cell morphology,
maintained normal cell morphology, and inhibited DON-induced apoptosis
(Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining), while PI3K inhibitors showed
the opposite trend. These results verify that DON may suppress the
PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and that apoptosis as well as autophagy
can be triggered owing to the inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
It was found that cell activity was significantly decreased by DON
and then the co-treatment with DON and 740Y-P for 12 h significantly
increased the cell activity, whereas the cell activity was significantly
decreased by co-treating IPEC-J2 cells with LY294002 and DON. After
12-h treatment of IPEC-J2 cells with DON, p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT
were significantly decreased. After IPEC-J2 cells were co-treated
with LY294002 and DON for 12 h, the expression of autophagy-related
protein LC3-II was notably upregulated, while the expression of p62
protein, p-mTOR/mTOR and p-AKT/AKT were significantly downregulated,
which, however, took on an opposite trend in contrast with the results
of co-treatment with 740YP and DON. The above results further demonstrate
that DON induces autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
pathway.

In conclusion, our study elucidated that DON exposure
decreased
cell viability and induced apoptosis with a concomitant increase of
autophagy, which indicated that DON-induced autophagy contributed
to apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. Furthermore, the following experiments
illuminated that DON could induce autophagy and apoptosis by inhibiting
the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. Altogether, our results indicate
that DON induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis through the activation
of autophagy by negatively regulating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling
pathway. These findings may provide a new recognition of the molecular
mechanism of DON cytotoxicity and provide a new strategy to prevent
and treat DON-induced cytotoxicity.
