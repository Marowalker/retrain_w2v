Glycopolypeptide-based
self-assembled nano-/microstructures with
surface-tethered carbohydrates are excellent mimics of glycoproteins
on the cell surface. To expand the broad repertoire of glycopolypeptide-based
supramolecular soft structures such as polymersomes formed via self-assembly
of amphiphilic polymers, we have developed a new class of polyionic
complex vesicles (PICsomes) with glycopolypeptides grafted on the
external surface. Oppositely charged hydrophilic block copolymers
of glycopolypeptide20-b-poly-l-lysine100 and PEG2k-b-poly-l-glutamate100 [PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)] were
synthesized using a combination of ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides and “click” chemistry.
Under physiological conditions, the catiomer and aniomer self-assemble
to form glycopolypeptide-conjugated PICsomes (GP-PICsomes) of micrometer
dimensions. Electron and atomic force microscopy suggests a hollow
morphology of the PICsomes, with inner aqueous pool (core) and peripheral
PIC (shell) regions. Owing to their relatively large (∼micrometers)
size, the hollowness of the supramolecular structure could be established
via fluorescence microscopy of single GP-PICsomes, both in solution
and under dry conditions, using spatially distributed fluorescent
probes. Furthermore, the dynamics of single PICsomes in solution could
be imaged in real time, which also allowed us to test for multivalent
interactions between PICsomes mediated by a carbohydrate (mannose)-binding
protein (lectin, Con-A). The immediate association of several GP-PICsomes
in the presence of Con-A and their eventual aggregation to form large
insoluble aggregate clusters reveal that upon self-assembly carbohydrate
moieties protrude on the outer surface which retains their biochemical
activity. Challenge experiments with excess mannose reveal fast deaggregation
of GP-PICsomes as opposed to that in the presence of excess galactose,
which further establishes the specificity of lectin-mediated polyvalent
interactions of the GP-PICsomes.

1 Introduction
The
interaction between carbohydrates present as glycoconjugates
on cell surfaces and extracellular proteins (lectins) plays several
complex roles in vivo, particularly in biomolecular recognition events
such as cell–cell recognition, adhesion, cancer cell metastasis,
pathogen invasion, and toxin mediation.1−4 Multivalent interaction of carbohydrates
and their corresponding receptors are key to the high specificity
of these important biomolecular interactions.5,6 In
this context, a vast number of multivalent synthetic glycoconjugates
have been prepared over the past decades, including dendritic scaffolds,
linear polymers, micelles, and nanoparticles.7−10 Among these, glycopolypeptides,
where sugar units are attached to a polypeptide backbone with well-defined
secondary structures, mimic the molecular composition of proteoglycans
and thus represent suitable candidates for biological applications.11−16 The construction of supramolecular nano-/microstructures (such as
micelles or vesicles) from glycopolypeptides is advantageous as they
are better mimics of densely populated carbohydrates on the cell surface
than the individual glycopolypeptides. Such self-assembled structures
can then be used to understand carbohydrate–protein interaction,
which would be more realistic mimics of living systems.

We and
others have reported on synthetic amphiphilic glycopolypeptide-based
block copolymers that undergo self-assembly to generate morphologically
different micro-/nanostructures.17−21 By varying factors such as molecular weight, chemical
composition, functionality, and architecture of the amphiphilic block
copolymers, the self-assembly could be controlled to afford size selection
and a broad variety of morphologies. In vitro studies have shown that
glycopolypeptide-based polymeric vesicles (≤100 nm) are endocytosed
into MCF-7/MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using an overexpressed MRC2
receptor (mannose receptor C-type 2), which opens up the possibility
of using these nanocarriers for receptor-mediated drug delivery to
cancer cells.22

Typically, the fabrication
of polymersomes using conventional self-assembly
of amphiphilic block copolymers is tedious and involves procedures
such as multiple dialysis, sonication, and heating. This, combined
with the use of organic solvents, can cause damage to the loaded cargo
(sensitive biomolecules such as proteins, enzymes, or drugs) and may
also induce toxicity in biological systems.23,24 In addition, for the delivery of hydrophilic macromolecules, their
poor solubility in nonaqueous medium and low penetration through the
middle hydrophobic membrane in amphiphilic polymersomes limit their
functionality as semipermeable containers.25 To overcome these limitations, the utilization of polyion complexes
(PICs) can provide better solution because PIC formation can be carried
out in aqueous media without the use of organic solvents, and the
preparation process is remarkably straightforward.26,27 Oppositely charged hydrophilic block copolymers undergo self-assembly
process via electrostatic interactions leading to the formation of
PIC assemblies or vesicles, the morphology of which depends on the
length and composition of ionic blocks as well as the length of aliphatic
spacer side chains.28−30 Although PIC vesicles (PICsomes) possess a hollow
spherical structure similar to polymersomes self-assembled from amphiphilic
polymers, the PIC membrane sandwiched between outer and inner hydrophilic
shell layers is semipermeable to hydrophilic solutes as opposed to
the hydrophobic shell layer of amphiphilic polymersomes. In the PIC
family, Kataoka and co-workers first demonstrated the formation of
PIC micellar nanostructures and subsequently, unilamellar polymersomes
in aqueous media by the electrostatic self-assembly of oppositely
charged double hydrophilic block copolymers (or charged homopolymers)
composed of biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(amino
acid)s.31−36

In the quest to expand the broad repertoire of glycopolypeptide-based
nano-/microstructures formed via self-assembly of homo and block amphiphilic
glycopolypeptides, we envisioned the development of a new class of
glycopolypeptide-based PICsomes in which glycopolypeptides are decorated
on the surface, so that they can potentially interact with specific
carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins). Herein, we report the efficient
synthesis of glycopolypeptide-based positively charged polyamino acids
and their self assembly with PEG-based negatively charged polyamino
acids in an aqueous medium to generate bioactive glycopolypeptide
PICsomes (GP-PICsomes) (Figure 1). The micrometer dimensions of these GP-PICsomes, with a
high surface density of high-molecular-weight glycopolypeptides, are
close mimics of the protein-bound carbohydrates found on cell surfaces.
In this context, it is important to understand their surface bioactivity,
which has typically been studied for smaller supramolecular soft structures
using techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, calorimetric assays,
and dynamic light scattering (DLS).37−41 The formation of large PICsomes allows for the visualization
(using optical microscopy) of their interaction in the presence of
specific lectins and aggregation/deaggregation dynamics in solution.
Such measurements can demonstrate whether carbohydrate-decorated PICsomes
retain their biological activity (and specificity) apart from probing
the role of lectins in mediating inter-PICsome interactions.

Figure 1 Simplified
schematic representation depicting the structures of
hydrophilic-charged block copolymers and their self-assembly into
glycopolypeptide-based PICsomes (GP-PICsomes) under aqueous environments.
Possibly, some of the PEG2k chains and glycopolypeptide
moieties may be present in the outer layers and the inner layers,
respectively. Although a high density of glycopolypeptides is present
on the surface, only a few of them are blown up in the cartoon depiction
for clarity.

Recently, the lectin-induced
aggregation kinetics of dextran-coated
colloidal silica (hard) particles have been investigated on a PEGylated
glass surface using confocal microscopy.42 Although this provides insights into the aggregation mechanisms
of mixed synthetic biomaterials induced by specific biomolecular interactions,
the polyvalent binding of lectins with glycoprotein mimics such as
glycopolypeptides grafted on soft polymersomes and their resulting
aggregation behaviors have not been studied yet. Using fluorescent
GP-PICsomes,
we report real-time imaging of dynamic events induced by the binding
of GP-PICsomes with a receptor (lectin), leading to the formation
of various higher-order aggregates, which disassemble only in the
presence of excess (monomeric) mannose, demonstrating biochemical
specificity of pendant groups on the surface.

(RITC), and
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (Mn = 5000) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glyco-N-carboxyanhydride was prepared using our previously published
methodology.43 Ligand tris(3-hydroxypropyltriazolylmethyl)amine
(THPTA) was synthesized by following the method of Finn and co-workers.44 All other chemicals used were obtained from
Merck, India. UV–vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 UV–vis
spectrometer using a 1 cm quartz cuvette at 25 °C. Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on PerkinElmer FT-IR spectrum

(DMF) as an eluant at 60 °C. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)/light
scattering samples were prepared at concentrations of 5 mg/mL. A constant
flow rate of 1 mL/min was maintained, and the instrument was calibrated
using poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) standards. Polydispersity index
(PDI) values were calculated using OmniSEC software. GPC measurements
of ionic block copolymers were performed using a Waters Alliance 2690
separation module (RI Detector 2410). Separations were achieved by

buffer with 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min at room
temperature (RT). GPC samples were prepared at concentrations of 2.5

Procedure for the Synthesis of Cationic
and Anionic Block Copolymers
2.1.1 Synthesis of Glycopolypeptide-b-poly-l-lysine (GP20-PLL100)
(GP20-PLL100) was synthesized by
conjugating
hydrophilic glycopolypeptide block and poly-l-lysine cationic
block using “click chemistry”. The blocks were first
synthesized separately and then were conjugated using click chemistry.

2.1.1.1 Synthesis of Alkyne Functionalized Mannose
Glycopolypeptide (Pr-GP20) as a Hydrophilic Block (1d)
First, Pr-AcGP20 was synthesized by
the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of mannose N-carboxyanhydrides monomer by propargylamine as an initiator using
our previously published methodology.43 Furthermore, Pr-AcGP20 was deprotected using hydrazine
hydrate in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to yield Pr-GP20 (Scheme S1).

2.1.1.2 Synthesis of Azido-Terminated Poly-l-lysine (N3-PLL100) as Cationic Block
(2d)
To a solution of Nε-trifluoroacetyl-l-lysine NCA (2b) in dry DMF (100 mg/mL) was added azido–PEG–amine
(DMF solution 0.5 M) as the initiator (M/I = 100) inside of the glove
box (Scheme S2). The progress of the polymerization
was monitored using FT-IR spectroscopy by comparing with the intensity
of the initial NCA anhydride stretching at 1785 and 1858 cm–1 (Figure S6b). The reaction was generally
complete within 36 h. The resulting polymer was reprecipitated in
deionized (DI) water for couple of times. The precipitated polymer
was collected by centrifugation and washed with DI water. A white
solid was obtained and dried under high vacuum at 50 °C to yield
N3-PLL(TFA)100 (2c) in almost 90%
yield.

Deprotection of N3-PLL(TFA)100Polymer (2d): The removal of labile triflouroacetyl (TFA)-protecting
groups of
lysine was achieved by dissolving the polymer (100 mg) in THF (4 mL)
followed by dropwise addition of KOH solution (1.5 equiv) and stirring
for an additional 24 h at RT. After complete deprotection, the solvent
was removed using rotary evaporator to afford a solid residue. The
residue was redissolved in DI water and transferred to a dialysis
tubing (3.5 kDa MWCO). The samples were dialyzed against 0.01 N HCl
for 1 day and then with water for another day with several water changes.
Dialyzed polymers were lyophilized to yield N3-PLL100 (2d) as white solids in the form of hydrochloride
salt.

2.1.1.3 Synthesis
of Glycopolypeptide-b-poly-l-lysine (GP20-PLL100) Cationic Polymer (4)
Azide-functionalized
deprotected poly-l-lysine (2d) (0.8 equiv) was
added to a solution of deprotected alkyne-terminated glycopolypeptide
(1d) in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4, 50 mM), and the resultant
reaction mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles. A premixed solution of CuSO4 (0.25 equiv) and ligand
THPTA (1.25 equiv) was added followed by the addition of sodium ascorbate
(2.5 equiv), and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h at RT
(Scheme 1). The progress
of the reaction was monitored by the disappearance of the azide stretch
at 2115 cm–1 using FT-IR (Figure S1). After completion of the reaction (disappearance of azide
stretch ≥95%), the reaction mixture was directly transferred
into a dialysis tube (12.5 kDa MWCO) and dialyzed against EDTA solution
for 1 day with solution (water) change every 4 h and followed by dialysis
against DI water solution for another day. Finally, the reaction mixture
was dialyzed against 0.01 N HCl for an additional 1 day. Dialyzed
polymers were lyophilized to yield glycopolypeptide-b-poly-l-lysine (GP20-PLL100) cationic
polymers as white fluffy solids in the form of hydrochloride salt
(Figure S2).

2.1.2 Synthesis
of PEG2k-b-poly-l-glutamate (PEG2k-PLG100) as
Anionic Block Copolymers
PEG2k-PLG100 was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of benzyl-l-glutamate NCA by amine-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG2k-NH2). PEG2k-NH2 monomethyl ether
(2000) was synthesized by following the method of Loos and co-workers.45

2.1.2.1 Synthesis of PEG2k-PLG100 Anionic Polymers by ROP (3c)
To a
solution of benzyl-l-glutamate NCA in dry DMF (3a) (100 mg/mL) was added PEG2k-NH2 (DMF solution,
0.5 M) as the initiator (M/I = 100) inside of the glove box (Scheme 2). The progress of
the polymerization was monitored using FT-IR spectroscopy by quantifying
the decrease in the intensity of the initial NCA anhydride stretching
at 1785 and 1858 cm–1 (Figure S6c). The reaction was generally complete within 24 h. The
resulting polymer was reprecipitated in DI water for a couple of times,
collected by centrifugation, and washed with DI water. The white solid
obtained was dried under high vacuum at 50 °C to afford PEG2k-PBLG100 (3b) in almost 90% yield.

Deprotection of PEG2k-PBLG100Polymer
(3c): A solution
of PEG2k-PBLG100 polymer (100 mg) in THF (4
mL) was placed in 50 mL round-bottom flask and cooled to 4 °C.
To the above-mentioned solution, NaOH solution (0.5 mL, 2 M; ∼1.5
equiv per carboxylic group) was added dropwise at 4 °C, which
resulted in a turbid solution after few minutes. The solution was
left under vigorous stirring for 16 h at RT. After complete deprotection,
the solvent was removed using rotary evaporator to obtain the crude
product. The crude product was redissolved in deionized water and
transferred into a dialysis tubing (3.5 kDa MWCO), which was then
dialyzed against DI water for 2 days with six water changes. Dialyzed
polymers were lyophilized to yield PEG2k-PLG100 (white solid) as a sodium salt (3c) (Figure S3).

2.1.2.2 Synthesis of Rhodamine-Labeled PEG2k-PLG100 Polymer (3d)
Et3N (16.9 μmol, 22 μL) and RITC (6.7 mg, 3 equiv)
were added to a solution of PEG2k-PBLG100 polymer
(100 mg, 4.16 μmol) in dry DMF (5 mL), and stirred for 48 h.
The reaction mixture was then reprecipitated in methanol (at least
five times) to remove excess RITC. Finally, the rhodamine-labeled
polymer was deprotected and purified by dialysis as stated above.
Dialyzed polymers were lyophilized to yield a rhodamine-labeled anionic
polymer (RhB-PEG2k-PLG100) as pink solids.

Homoanionic copolymer (Hx-PLG100) was synthesized
by polymerizing benzyl-l-glutamate NCA with hexylamine as
an initiator in dry DMF. The deprotection of the benzyl group to yield
Hx-PLG100 was carried out using the same protocol as described
for the deprotection of PEG2k-PBLG100 polymer.

2.2 Self-Assembly
of Charged Block Polypeptides
Cationic block copolymers (GP20-PLL100) at
a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL and anionic block copolymers (PEG2k-PLG100) at a concentration of 0.73 mg/mL were
individually solubilized in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The solutions
were filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter to remove dust
particles and any other insoluble portions. GP20-PLL100 solutions were added in one portion to a solution of PEG2k-PLG100 at RT in an equal charge ratio of −COO– and −NH3+ and were mixed
thoroughly using a vortex mixer for 2 min. The resulting polymer solution
was incubated for 24 h at RT to generate the GP-PICsomes. RhB-labeled
PICs were formed from rhodamine-labeled block aniomer (RhB-PEG2k-PLG100) with block catiomer (GP20-PLL100), following a similar methodology.

2.3 Dye Encapsulation
2.3.1 Preparation of FITC-Encapsulated GP-PICsomes
The encapsulation
of hydrophilic molecule FITC-dextran into the
GP-PICsomes was performed using the coassembly method. First, filtered
solutions of PEG2k-PLG100 (1.46 mg/mL) and GP20-PLL100 (1 mg/mL) were prepared separately in
50 mM phosphate buffer. 500 μL of GP20-PLL100 solution (1 mg/mL) was added to a 500 μL solution containing
0.75 mg FITC-dextran (Mn = 5000) and 0.73
mg PEG2k-PLG100 in phosphate buffer (50 mM,
pH 7.4) and was mixed thoroughly using a vortex mixer. The solution
was incubated for 24 h at RT to encapsulate FITC-dextran into GP-PICsomes.
The mixture was then placed into a dialysis membrane (50 kDa MWCO)
and dialyzed against phosphate buffer (10 mM) at 4 °C for 24
h while changing the buffer at a 4 h interval. Within 24 h, all unencapsulated
FITC-dextran was excluded from the dialysis membrane. After the removal
of free FITC-dextran, the mixture was dialyzed against DI water for
24 h.

2.4 Dye Release Studies
Immediately after
the removal of excess FITC-dextran, the dye-loaded GP-PICsome solution
was transferred into a fresh dialysis tube and then immersed into
30 mL of phosphate buffer solution (10 mM) and stirred at RT for 2
days. At predefined time points, aliquots (1 mL) were removed from
the buffer solution outside of the dialysis membrane, which was replaced
with an equal volume of fresh buffer. The concentration of FITC-dextran
in the aliquots was estimated using fluorescence spectroscopy. Finally,
the release of FITC-dextran from the GP-PICsomes was reported as a
percentage of the total amount released from the dialysis tubes.

2.5 Fluorescence Imaging of GP-PICsomes
An
epifluorescence/total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)
microscopy setup built on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U)
was used for imaging GP-PICsomes and studying the process of aggregation
and deaggregation. Details on the home-built setup are provided elsewhere.18 In brief, a 488 nm argon ion laser (Melles Griot,
model: 35-MAP-321-240) and a 532 nm DPSS laser (Melles Griot, model:
LD-WL206) were used to illuminate the same area of the sample (field
of view ∼1000 μm2) via an objective lens (Nikon,
1.49 NA, 60× TIRF). The emission from the sample was collected
by the same objective and passed through appropriate dichroic/longpass
filters and detected by a CCD camera (DVC 1412AM). For colocalization
studies of individual GP-PICsomes labeled with two fluorophores, FITC
and RhB were selectively excited at 488 and 532 nm, and their emission
was collected using 445–530 and 545–630 nm bandpass
emission filters, respectively. The excitation power (50–200
μW) was varied for the two lasers using neutral density filters
such that the comparable intensity of emission (within a factor of
3) is observed in the two energetically separated detection channels
(colored green for FITC and red for RhB). Typically, movies were collected
with an exposure time of 100 ms and averaged over 100 frames before
further image processing. To monitor the aggregation dynamics of GP-PICsomes
(labeled with RhB) in the presence of Con-A and their deaggregation
in excess mannose, movies were collected at 5 Hz. ImageJ was used
to obtain montage images from the acquired movies, which show single-frame
sequential snapshots at regular time interval. To visualize the trajectories
of single GP-PICsomes and their aggregates in solution, maximum projection
(MP) images,46 rather than time average
images, were generated over a certain time interval using ImageJ.
All measurements were performed at 295 K.

2.6.1 For Hollowness and Dye
Encapsulation in
GP-PICsomes
Fluorescence imaging in solution was performed
by placing 20 μL of FITC-dextran-encapsulated RhB-GP-PICsomes
in between two glass coverslips and incubating for 10 min. For dry-state
measurements, the sample was spin-coated (20 μL, 1000 rpm, 1
min; Ducom PRS-6K) on a clean coverslip and imaged after 30 min.

2.6.2 Sample Preparation for Fluorescence Imaging
of GP-PICsomes Aggregation and Deaggregation
A solution (1.0
mg/mL) of Con-A was prepared in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
0.1 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM CaCl2, and 0.1 M NaCl.
The aggregation experiment was performed by preincubating RhB-GP-PICsomes
with Con-A and by sandwiching this solution in between two glass coverslips.
A reservoir of buffer solution was maintained on both sides of the
solution to prevent solvent evaporation. Alternatively, Con-A was
introduced between the coverslips and incubated for 10 min for adsorption
on the glass surface, and excess Con-A solution was washed out by
capillary action using a filter paper at one end while maintaining
enough buffer in the reservoir on the other end. Finally, RhB-GP-PICsome
solution was introduced from reservoir end of the coverslips while
imaging. Movies were collected at 3 Hz to visualize the aggregates.
For deaggregation studies, preformed aggregates were prepared by mixing
Con-A solution (50 μL) and RhB-GP-PICsome solution (100 μL)
for different times (10–30 min). This mixture was then introduced
into a homemade flow chamber through an injection pump, where flow
rates can be controlled. After visualizing the aggregates of RhB-GP-PICsomes,
enough buffer was injected to wash off excess aggregates and unbound
Con-A, followed by the introduction of buffer containing 300 mM mannose.
Flow of the solution was controlled using the syringe pump. The control
experiment for deaggregation process with 300 mM galactose solution
was performed not only under identical conditions but also for much
longer time (10 min) incubation with excess galactose.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis of Cationic and
Anionic Block Copolymers
GP-PICsomes were synthesized by
the self-assembly of oppositely
charged double hydrophilic block copolymer via the electrostatic interaction
between GP-containing catiomer and PEG-containing aniomer. Kataoka
et al. had previously demonstrated that uniform PICsomes were formed
by mixing cationic PEG2k-b-poly(aspartamide)100 and PEG2k-b-poly(aspartate)100.29 They subsequently demonstrated
that the usage of a large volume of PEGs, or a higher PEG weight fraction
(fPEG) in the block copolymers, prevented
the growth of PIC and drove micelle formation because of the immiscibility
of a PEG part and PIC part as well as large steric hindrance of the
PEG strands.30,31 We decided to attempt the synthesis
of GP-PICsomes based on a double hydrophilic catiomer GP20-b-poly(l-lysine)100 and aniomer
PEG2k-b-poly(l-glutamate)100, such that upon mixing, 100-mer poly-l-lysine
and poly-l-glutamate would generate the stable PIC membrane,
where most of the GP20 and PEG2k moieties would
form the outer and inner layers, respectively. Because the carbohydrate
side chains are very bulky (MW 7 kDa), we avoided using GP in both
catiomer and aniomer to avoid the formation of micelles. A short PEG2k was used in the aniomer instead to help the PIC transform
into PICsomes.

The catiomer was obtained by independently synthesizing
alkyne-labeled GP20 and azide-labeled PLL100 and then by conjugating them using click chemistry (Scheme 1). GP20-containing
pendant carbohydrate moieties with an alkyne at the chain end were
synthesized by following our previously developed methodology that
involves propargylamine-initiated ROP of the mannosyl-N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomer.43 The
removal of acetyl protection followed by purification lead to fully
water-soluble alkyne-terminated GP (Scheme S1). The cationic PLL polymer containing azide at the chain end was
synthesized from TFA-protected l-lysine (Scheme S2). All of the protected copolymer building blocks,
which included alkyne-AcGP20 and azide-PLL(TFA)100, had low PDI (Figure S4) and the chain
length of each polymer (from Mn) was determined
from 1H NMR spectra using end-group analysis (Table 1 and Supporting Information figure: NMR section). The Mn values determined matched closely to that expected from
M/I values. After the deprotection of copolymers, both alkyne-GP20 and azide-PLL100 were conjugated using copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne click reaction to synthesize cationic block-co-glycopolypeptides (GP20-PLL100).
The progress of the reaction was monitored using FT-IR spectra by
following the decrease in the characteristic azide stretch at 2117
cm–1 (Figure S1). After
the reaction was complete, dialysis against EDTA solution was performed
to remove all residual copper followed by dialysis (using 12 kDa MWCO
dialysis membrane) against DI water to remove the excess GP (the molecular
weight of deprotected GP is 7 kDa) used in the click reaction. We
have performed an SEC analysis of this purified GP20-PLL100 block copolypeptides to ascertain the efficiency of click
reaction. The aqueous GPC of the purified “clicked”
product (Figure S5) displayed a new peak
at higher molecular weight, which was distinctly shifted from the
parent GP and polylysine, suggesting the formation of the clicked
product. Moreover, the complete absence of characteristic organo azide
stretch (2115 cm–1) in IR analysis (Figure S1) suggests a near-quantitative click
reaction. The exact composition of the block copolypeptide was determined
from 1H NMR by comparing the resonance characteristics
present in the GP and PLL segment that was present in the expected
molar ratio of 1:1 (Figure S2).

For
anionic block copolypeptides, ROP of γ-benzyl-l-glutamate N-carboxyanhydride was performed using
PEG2k-NH2 as the macroinitiator (M/I = 100)
in dry DMF (Scheme 1 and Table 1). The
completion of the reaction was confirmed by the complete disappearance
of the anhydride stretch of initial NCA at 1785 and 1858 cm–1 in the FT-IR spectra (Figure S6c). The
number average molecular weight (Mn) was
calculated using 1H NMR from the relative intensity of
the peak at 3.68 ppm because of the characteristic proton present
in the initiator PEG-amine (−OCH2CH2)
with the proton peaks of the benzyl group (−C6H5) present in the benzyl ester moiety of the polymer (7.30
ppm). The molecular weight distribution observed from GPC was monomodal
and the PDI calculated was reasonably narrow (Figure S4c and Table 1). PEG2k-PLG100 was prepared by the
benzyl-ester deprotection of PEG2k-PBLG100 using
base hydrolysis. 1H NMR of the resulting polymer showed
complete disappearance of the signals corresponding to the benzyl
group and rest of the signals were assigned to PEG2k-PLG100 (Figure S3).

3.2 Self-Assembly of Charged Polymers
GP-PICsomes were
prepared by mixing 0.5 mg/mL solution of GP20-PLL100 and 0.36 mg/mL solution of PEG2k-PLG100 in
50 mM pH 7.4 phosphate buffer such that equimolar
amounts of l-lysine and glutamic acid residues were present
in solution (electrostatically neutralized condition). The mixture
was first vortexed for 15 min and then incubated overnight at RT.
To confirm the types of macroscopic structures formed upon self-assembly,
SEM was performed on GP-PICsomes cast on a surface under solvent-evaporated
conditions. SEM measurements showed the presence of a spherical morphology
(Figure 2a) having
an average diameter of 1.67 μm with sizes between 1.2 and 2.2
μm (Figure 2b).
GP-PICsomes were also characterized using TEM after adding a drop
of GP-PICsome solution onto carbon-coated copper grid and negatively
staining with uranyl acetate (0.2 wt %) solution. TEM analysis also
indicated the presence of well-dispersed PICsomes with a spherical
structure having a characteristic dark rim on the outer surface, indicating
their hollow morphology (Figure 2c). Further evidence of hollow morphology was obtained
from AFM measurements on a silicon wafer (Figure 2d), which revealed a wall thickness of ∼30
nm and a height/diameter ratio of ∼0.08, which is consistent
with a spherical hollow vesicular morphology.47 Because all of the above microscopies were performed in the dried
state, we analyzed the size of the PICsomes formed after 24 h incubation
of the GP20-PLL100 and PEG2k-PLG100 using DLS from which an average diameter of 1.46 μm
was determined. This was again consistent with SEM and TEM measurements
(Figure S8). The size and distribution
of GP-PICsomes were also determined using optical micrograph, which
also showed an average diameter of 1.43 μm (Figure S9). The vesicle wall thickness of 25–30 nm
obtained from both TEM and AFM measurements approximately equals the
size of a fully extended chain length of the constituent polyelectrolyte
strands (∼25 nm), roughly estimated by summation of the average
backbone length of each amino acid unit in the polypeptide chain (C–C–N,
0.24 nm).33 This suggests that the vesicle
wall is composed of a monolayer of PIC sandwiched by PEG and GPs palisades
or the mixture of both PEG and GP part in the inner and outer surface.

amounts of GP20-PLL100 and PEG2k-PLG100. (a) SEM image of GP-PICsomes, (b) size distribution of
GP-PICsomes from SEM images, (c) TEM image of GP-PICsomes, and (d)
AFM image of the GP-PICsomes drop-cast from aqueous solution on the
silicon wafer and their corresponding height profile.

We believe that in our system, the growth of GP-PICsomes
in aqueous
medium is initiated by uPIC formation, which is a result of the bilayer
formed owing to the interaction between cationic amino groups in (GP20-PLL100) and anionic glutamate groups in PEG2k-PLG100, resulting in charge neutralization.34 This uPIC units grow over time resulting in
an initial formation of a three-layered membrane structure consisting
of a middle PIC phase sandwiched by external and internal hydrophilic
shell layers (PEG and GP). When the membrane-like aggregates become
so large that the interfacial energy is predominant, the membrane-like
bilayer closes to form vesicles. The bending of the three-layered
lamellar structure would reduce the interfacial free energy and enclose
it into a vesicular morphology.48−51 Because the uPIC unit is composed of 100-mer PLL
and 100-mer PLG, it would behave as a stiff polymer unit with low
internal degrees of freedom and low formational entropy. Following
the general rule that increasing order inherently leads to an increased
bending modulus κ of the bilayers, a vesicle with relatively
low interfacial curvature leading to large sizes (micron diameter)
is expected. We note that the molecular weight of the shell layer
GP20 (MW 7 kDa) is significantly higher than that of PEG2k and such high weight fractions have been shown earlier to
prevent the formation of PICsomes. However, their self-assembly into
PICsomes is likely attributed to the efficient packing of the helical
GP20 unit (see circular dichroism data in Figure S7) at the surface of GP-PICsomes, which induces morphology
bearing a lower curvature as observed earlier with amphiphilic glycopolypeptides.17,18,20,22 In GP-PICsomes, three possibilities exist during the formation of
the three-layered lamellar structure with respect to the position
of GP20 and PEG2k in the inner layer (I) or
outer layer (O) of the PICsomes: [(I)PEG-PIC-(O)GP], [(I)PEG, GP-PIC-(O)PEG,
GP], [(I)GP-PIC-(O)PEG]. Because GP20 is much more bulky
than PEG2k, the assemblies will prefer a morphology with
less curvature and hence GP20 chains are expected to be
present on the outer surface of the PICsomes (the first two of the
three possible structures mentioned above). The presence of glycopolypeptide
part on PICsomes outer surface will be later confirmed by investigating
their interaction with carbohydrate-binding protein (lectins). It
is possible that some of the PEG2k chains are also present
in the outer layer, however, we were unable to determine the extent
of heterogeneity. The presence of PEG2k in the aniomer
was critical to the formation of PICsomes. Upon mixing equimolar solutions
of GP20-PLL100 with the homoaniomer Hx-PLG100, formation of well-defined structures was not observed
(Figure S10).

3.3 Stability
and Dye Encapsulation Studies of
GP-PICsomes
In an aqueous solution, the hollow nature of
the spherical particles was tested by encapsulating hydrophilic macromolecule
FITC-dextran. UV–vis spectra of FITC-dextran-encapsulated GP-PICsomes
show a characteristic peak (λmax) at 490 nm (Figure S11). The encapsulation efficiency (EE)
was determined as EE = (W1/W2) × 100, where W1 is
the amount of FITC-dextran encapsulated and W2 is the amount of FITC-dextran added initially for encapsulation.
The value of W1 was calculated by measuring
the optical density at 493 nm (molar absorption coefficient of FITC-dextran
in water is taken as 75 000 L mol–1). The
percentage EE of FITC-dextran was determined to be ∼2.06%.

To test the release of FITC-dextran from GP-PICsomes, the aqueous
solution of FITC-dextran-encapsulated GP-PICsomes was dialyzed against
phosphate buffer solution for 2 days. Emission spectra of the phosphate
buffer outside of the dialysis tube indicated the leakage of FITC-dextran
with the passage of time (Figure S12a).
After 48 h, the leakage of FITC-dextran was estimated by comparing
the absorption spectra of FITC-dextran-encapsulated GP-PICsomes inside
of the dialysis tubing before and after the release experiment. The
percentage of FITC-dextran released in this period of 48 h was determined
to be approximately 63% (Figure S12b),
which indicates its slow release from the GP-PICsomes.

3.4 Visualization of Individual GP-PICsomes
Although both
AFM and electron microscopy measurements provide
crucial information on the size distributions and shapes of the GP-PICsomes
under dry conditions, it is difficult to conclusively comment whether
the solution structures are indeed preserved upon solvent evaporation
(for drop-cast samples). Furthermore, it is also challenging to conclude
directly from AFM or TEM measurements whether the morphology of GP-PICsomes
is indeed hollow, as indicated by dye encapsulation studies. Since
the dimensions of these GP-PICsomes are much larger than the diffraction
limit, the most direct way to test their morphology (and dimensions)
in solution is to image individual PICsomes with two fluorescent dyes
located in different spatial locations, specifically the central aqueous
pool and the PIC shell regions.

To study colocalization behaviors,
RhB-labeled GP-PICsomes were synthesized by the self-assembly of block
aniomer (RhB-PEG2k-PLG100) and block catiomer
(GP20-PLL100), following which hydrophilic FITC-dextran
dye was encapsulated within the RhB-GP-PICsomes. Careful optimization
on the relative proportion of encapsulated FITC-dextran and sequential
excitation of the two dyes using 488 and 532 nm lasers allowed us
to visualize GP-PICsomes in solution with comparable emission intensity
(within a factor of 3) in energetically separated detection channels. Figure 3a–c shows
two such individual FITC-encapsulated RhB-GP-PICsomes in buffer solution.
It is important to note that the vast majority of the GP-PICsomes
undergo diffusion in solution; however, it was possible to image few
spatially segregated PICsomes, which adhere to the glass surface and
do not undergo any translational motion. The images obtained from
both emission channels show that in solution, GP-PICsomes are quasispherical
and have dimensions of 1–2 μm, consistent with AFM and
electron microscopy measurements (Figure 2). More importantly, the spatial intensity
profiles in the two detection channels display contrasting (filled
and ringlike) emission patterns (Figure 3a,b), which can be readily visualized in
the pseudocolor overlay images (Figure 3c) and in the intensity line profiles, as expected
for a hollow morphology.

Figure 3 Fluorescence images of individual GP-PICsomes
labeled with both
FITC and RhB in solution (a–c) and spin-cast on glass coverslips
(d–f), collected through bandpass filters for FITC (a,d) and
RhB (b,e) emission (colored green and red, respectively), along with
pseudocolor images (c,f) obtained via quantitative superposition of
intensity images acquired for the same area through two detection
channels. The line profiles (color-coded) of single GP-PICsomes (identified
in c and f) on the top (a–c) and bottom (d–f) depict
the emission intensity in each detection channel and the normalized
emission for the overlay images (c,f) in solution and under dry conditions.

In contrast, the emission behaviors
of GP-PICsomes in the absence
of solvents are quite different, as observed from dual-color imaging
of FITC-encapsulated RhB-GP-PICsomes spin-cast on glass coverslips
from the solution (Figure 3d–f). First, solvent evaporation leads to higher density
of individual PICsomes that can be imaged in the same field of view.
Interestingly, the relative background emission in the FITC channel
(Figure 3d) is significantly
higher as compared to that in solution (Figure 3a), which suggests partial leaching of encapsulated
FITC upon solvent removal. This inference is further supported by
the images of single GP-PICsomes (and corresponding line profiles)
observed in the RhB channel (Figure 3e), which have much higher intensity and spatial uniformity
in emission (edges and central regions) as compared to that in solution,
presumably owing to the shrinkage (flattenning) of GP-PICsomes during
dehydration (leaching). Furthermore, it is also evident from the overlay
image (Figure 3f) and
intensity line profiles that the emission originating from FITC within
GP-PICsomes is far more localized (300–500 nm) as compared
with those in buffer solution. This indicates the existence of water
pools of relatively smaller dimensions within flattened PICsomes,
where remaining hydrophilic dextran-FITC accumulates and increases
the effective local concentration, thereby producing a relatively
intense localized emission from constricted GP-PICsomes. Nonetheless,
both of these measurements performed in a buffer solution and under
dry conditions provide direct evidence on the existence of hollow
morphology.

3.5 Dynamics of GP-PICsomes
and Their Interaction
with Con-A
To address whether glycopolypeptides were displayed
on the outer surface of the mannose-containing PICsomes and verify
that the surface remained bioactive upon self-assembly, we studied
the aggregation behaviors of GP-PICsomes upon the addition of the
mannose-specific lectin, Con-A, and investigated deaggregation of
clustered PICsomes in excess of free mannose. Simple turbidimetic
assays were not performed, as free GP20-PLL100, if still present in solution, could also cross-link with Con-A
to form turbid solutions. The relatively large (∼micrometers)
size of the GP-PICsomes, which are expected to diffuse sluggishly
in solution, allowed us to probe Con-A-induced aggregation dynamics
of individual assemblies in buffer solution using epifluorescence
video microscopy. As schematically depicted in Figure 4, if the mannose moieties are present on
the outer surface of the GP-PICsomes, their polyvalent interaction
with the tetrameric Con-A would lead to the formation of large PICsome
aggregates. In contrast, if
the GP moieties are present in the inner membrane post self-assembly,
the addition of Con-A would not lead to the association of two or
more GP-PICsomes and therefore would not induce aggregation.

Figure 4 Schematic depiction
of the multivalent association of GP-PICsomes
mediated by mannose-binding lectin (Con-A), which leads to aggregation,
and disassembly of aggregates only in the presence of excess free
mannose (not galactose) in solution.

The dynamics of two single RhB-GP-PICsomes in buffer solution
in
the absence of any external hydrodynamic force is shown in Figure 5a, where each PICsome
undergoes 3D-translational motion as evidenced from the spatial intensity
distributions of their trajectories. The diffusion dynamics of GP-PICsomes
can be easily captured at 0.5–1 Hz because of their relatively
large size; however, we refrain from extracting diffusion constants
because it is unclear whether they interact with the glass surface
intermittently. Upon incubation (for 15 min) with 0.5 mg/mL lectin
receptor (Con-A), which has four mannose-binding sites, rarely do
we detect individual PICsomes. Rather, the diffusion of small aggregates
constituting of few (typically 3–6) GP-PICsomes can be readily
visualized (Figure S13). The tumbling dynamics
(without any hydrodynamic drag) of one such small aggregate assembly,
constituting of five or six GP-PICsomes attached to each other, is
shown as single-frame sequential snapshots in Figure 5b (0–20 s) along with their trajectory
(see Movie M3). We noticed that this small
aggregate eventually gets attached to the surface (after ∼20
s), presumably because of binding to surface-adsorbed Con-A. To test
this, Con-A solution (1 mg/mL) was introduced on a glass coverslip
and incubated for 10 min, so that some of it adsorbs on the substrate.
After the removal of excess Con-A with buffer solution, GP-PICsomes
were introduced in the flow chamber. Here, surface attachment of aggregates
and their eventual immobilization in the presence of slight hydrodynamic
flow can be observed frequently, as exemplified using another aggregate
shown in Figure 5c.
We noticed that in the presence of excess (1 mg/mL) Con-A in solution,
higher order aggregation is induced (Figure 5d), where all GP-PICsomes within the aggregate
tumble (and move) synchronously, and the entire aggregate assembly
diffuse sluggishly even in the presence of weak hydrodynamic flow.

of individual RhB-labeled GP-PICsomes in the absence
of any external hydrodynamic force. Top and bottom rows represent
ten single-frame sequential snapshots for two representative GP-PICsomes
in solution. Left and right panels represent corresponding maximum

and eventual surface association of GP-PICsome aggregates of various

single-frame sequential snapshots are shown for each aggregate. Movies M3, M4, and M5 are provided in Supporting Information. (e)

of very large extended aggregate clusters of GP-PICsomes upon incubation
with Con-A for 30 min. Movie M6 provided
in Supporting Information depicts the clustering of aggregates in
three dimensions.

Typically, over several
tens of minutes, we found that more number
of smaller aggregates coalesce with each other and eventually adhere
directly to the surface or attach onto existing surface-bound aggregates
(Figure 5e). Furthermore,
we noticed that some of these aggregates (similar to those zoomed-in
at the bottom as shown in Figure 5e) tend to undergo anchored or restricted motion in
solution even when attached to the surface (Figure S13). Such a restricted anchored movement may also be responsible
for the Con-A-induced bridging (or connection) of two or more nearby
aggregates, eventually leading to the formation of higher-order aggregates,
as shown in Figure 5e (blow up on top). It is worth mentioning that estimation of the
number of GP-PICsomes within each surface-bound aggregate using static
fluorescence images (such as Figure 5e) can be very challenging if not impossible; for instance,
single snapshot image at 25 s in Figure 5b seems to portray the existence of only
2–3 GP-PICsomes within the aggregate, whereas observation of
the entire movie reveals a more realistic picture. In fact, all large
aggregates are 3D assemblies, which constitute much more number of
PICsomes as compared with those observed from the static fluorescence
images. This is further evident for very large extended clusters of
aggregates (Figure 5f) that are generated on the surface over several hours in the presence
of Con-A, and such 3D assembly of PICsomes in these large aggregate
clusters can be readily visualized upon changing the (z-) focus of the objective during fluorescence imaging (see Movie M6).

To ensure that the aggregation
of RhB-GP-PICsomes observed was
indeed induced by specific interaction of the mannose-binding domain
in Con-A interacting with the surface-grafted mannose moieties of
GP-PICsomes (Figure 4), we have performed challenge experiments with excess (300 mM) of
free mannose and monitored surface-bound large aggregates and aggregate-clusters
using fluorescence video imaging. The results of such a competition
experiment are depicted in Figure 6a, where a large aggregate cluster of RhB-GP-PICsomes
is imaged under hydrodynamic flow in the absence and presence of excess
mannose. We find that within a few seconds in the presence of the
mannose-containing buffer solution (at ∼6 s), the aggregate
cluster disassembles rapidly (∼seconds) and only a small fraction
of GP-PICsomes (or their smaller aggregates) still remain bound to
the surface. A possible reason for the presence of these firmly adhered
smaller aggregates is that mannose was unable to access all Con-A-binding
sites (buried within aggregates) with equal ease. As a control, the
same experiments were performed with galactose, a carbohydrate which
has nominal binding affinity toward Con-A (Figure 4). We find that excess (300 mM) of galactose
does not affect the aggregates or large aggregate clusters in any
way. For instance, as shown in Figure 6b, neither deaggregation occurred nor any GP-PICsome
disassembled from Aggregate-1 under continuous flow of buffer-containing
excess galactose. We were able to identify a few large GP-PICsome
aggregate clusters, parts of which were not firmly anchored to the
glass surface, such as Aggregate-2 in Figure 6b. Relatively long time (5 min) incubation
with excess galactose followed by intermittent buffer flow (momentarily
turned on and turned off) could only induce a part of this aggregate
cluster to swivel rather than disassemble, which recoiled in the absence
of the hydrodynamic drag without altering the remaining structure.
From these experiments, we conclude that the self-assembled PICsomes
displayed part or all of the GP on their outer surface, and the mannose
residues of GP specifically interacted with it’s lectin rendering
the surface of PICsomes biochemically active.

4 Conclusions
To develop mimics of glycoproteins-bearing
cell surfaces, we have
synthesized oppositely charged hydrophilic block copolymers (catiomer
and aniomer) based on glycopolypeptide-b-poly-l-lysine and PEG2k-b-poly-l-glutamate, which self-assemble in an aqueous medium to form glycopolypeptide-based
polyionic complex vesicles (GP-PICsomes). Imaging of these microscopic
assemblies in solution and in the dry state reveals a hollow structural
morphology of few micrometer dimensions, where several carbohydrate
functional groups protrude out in solution, reminiscent of a biological
cell. More importantly, the surface-grafted mannose moieties retain
biochemically activity, as evident from multivalent interaction dynamics
of the GP-PICsomes to form aggregates, mediated by a carbohydrate-binding
protein (lectin). Our results demonstrate that the bioactivity of
surface-grafted carbohydrate groups of PICsomes is highly specific
to the lectin Con-A that has multiple binding sites and thereby acts
as an effective bridge between GP-PICsomes to induce strong interparticle
interactions. Using fluorescently labeled GP-PICsomes, we have been
able to visualize the aggregation dynamics in the presence of Con-A,
which show the formation of extended, three-dimensional higher-order
aggregate clusters from the association of individual PICsomes over
time, at times mediated by Con-A bound to the glass surface. Finally,
we show that the PICsome-aggregate clusters disassemble (deaggregate)
spontaneously only in the presence of excess mannose in solution,
reiterating the specificity of biomolecular interactions of surface
pendant groups. We speculate that these large surface bioactive GP-PICsomes
(or further modifications thereof) have the potential to be used as
suitable models to study various interactions on cellular surfaces
and intercellular recognition.
