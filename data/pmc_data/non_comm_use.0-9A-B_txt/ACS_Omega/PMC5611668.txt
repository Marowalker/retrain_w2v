Maternal exposure
to marijuana during the lactation period—either
active or passive—has prompted concerns about transmission
of cannabinoids to breastfed infants and possible subsequent adverse
health consequences. Assessing these health risks requires a sensitive
analytical approach that is able to quantitatively measure trace-level
cannabinoids in breast milk. Here, we describe a saponification–solid
phase extraction approach combined with ultra-high-pressure liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry for simultaneously
quantifying Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD),
and cannabinol (CBN) in breast milk. We demonstrate for the first
time that constraints on sensitivity can be overcome by utilizing
alkaline saponification of the milk samples. After extensively optimizing
the saponification procedure, the validated method exhibited limits
of detections of 13, 4, and 66 pg/mL for THC, CBN, and CBD, respectively.
Notably, the sensitivity achieved was significantly improved, for
instance, the limits of detection for THC is at least 100-fold more
sensitive compared to that previously reported in the literature.
This is essential for monitoring cannabinoids in breast milk resulting
from passive or nonrecent active maternal exposure. Furthermore, we
simultaneously acquired multiple reaction monitoring transitions for 12C- and 13C-analyte isotopes. This combined analysis
largely facilitated data acquisition by reducing the repetitive analysis
rate for samples exceeding the linear limits of 12C-analytes.
In addition to high sensitivity and broad quantitation range, this
method delivers excellent accuracy (relative error within ±10%),
precision (relative standard deviation <10%), and efficient analysis.
In future studies, we expect this method to play a critical role in
assessing infant exposure to cannabinoids through breastfeeding.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Marijuana has been increasingly
used for medical and recreational
activities both globally and domestically.1,2 Worldwide,
there were 177 million people aged 15–64 years, who used marijuana
at least once in 2012, as reported by the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime.1 In the United States,
an estimated proportion using marijuana in the past month among person
≥12 years old increased from 6.2% in 2002 to 7.5% in 2013.3 As of November, 2016, 26 states and the District
of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana use, and 8 states and
the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational
use, although both recreational and medical marijuana use remain illegal
by federal law in the United States.

Within this context, it
is anticipated that the use of marijuana
in lactating women is increasing as well.4 Because cannabinoids, marijuana-specific components, for instance,
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and cannabinol
(CBN) (Figure 1), are
highly lipophilic, a certain fraction of absorbed amounts following
maternal marijuana exposure will be secreted into breast milk,5,6 resulting in breastfed infants’ exposure to these compounds.
This exposure has raised concerns about possible negative impacts
on infants’ early growth and neurodevelopment, including attention
problems and decreased cognitive function.4,5,7

Figure 1 Molecular structures of major cannabinoids.

Despite many previous efforts,5,8,9 infant health risks associated
with cannabinoid exposure
via breast milk remain largely undetermined, precluding evidence-based
guidance for medical providers and lactating mothers. Filling this
void of actionable public health information requires an efficient
analytical approach with sufficient sensitivity to quantitatively
measure trace-level cannabinoids in breast milk.

Analytical
methods for measuring cannabinoids in breast milk are
limited in the literature. Currently, there is only one analytical
method available in the open literature in which the researchers proposed
a liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) procedure to separate cannabinoids
from milk matrix, exhibiting a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.5 ng/mL
for THC.10 The simple LLE procedure may
provide sufficient sensitivity to measure levels of cannabinoids in
those who actively use marijuana for medical or recreational purposes,
but may not be suitable for detecting the passive marijuana smoke
exposure that lactating mothers may experience. Moreover, false-negative
detection of cannabinoids in milk samples from passive or nonrecent
past users by the analytical methods with high LODs will underestimate
actual infant exposures and associated health risks.

Here, we
describe an alkaline saponification–solid phase
extraction (SPE) approach to separate cannabinoids from milk matrix.
We demonstrate that saponification of the sample is crucial to separate
cannabinoids from milk fats and, thus, to obtain the high selectivity
and sensitivity essential for quantifying trace-level cannabinoids
in breast milk from passive or nonrecent active marijuana exposure.
Subsequently, we achieve chromatographic separation using ultra-high-pressure
liquid chromatography (UPLC) and detection by tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS). Additionally, to enable measurement of cannabinoids in breast
milk from both active and passive users, we monitor multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) transitions for two naturally occurring analyte isotopes, 13C and 12C, respectively. This combined analysis
significantly reduces the burden of sample preparation and facilitates
data acquisition. Finally, we demonstrate that this method yields
excellent accuracy, precision, linearity, robustness, and most importantly,
ultrasensitivity at the picogram level.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 LLE by a Variety of Solvents
Human
milk is a complex mixture composed of thousands of constituents including
proteins, lipids, minerals, and many other solids.11 An effective cleanup procedure, separating cannabinoids
from milk matrix, is crucial to achieve desired selectivity and sensitivity,
especially considering that cannabinoids are highly lipophilic. Early
in the method development process, we investigated LLE methods for
extracting cannabinoids from milk matrix, and examined the performance
of a variety of organic solvents, including hexane, ethyl acetate,
acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile (0.5 mL milk sample extracted
with 1.5 mL organic solvent, vortex shaking for 10 min for three times
at room temperature) (Figure 2). Despite high average preparation efficiencies achieved
when using 1.5 mL acidified methanol (5% formic acid) as LLE solvent
(Figure 2), none of
the solvents, used either alone or combined, provided preparation
efficiencies that are able to reach the picogram per milliliter sensitivity
level required to evaluate passive cannabinoid exposure. For instance,
the average MS spiking IS preparation efficiency (PE) for THC was
less than 2.5% (Figure 2). Low PE by direct LLE approaches most likely result from interactions
between cannabinoids and various milk constituents (i.e., proteins
and fats), and/or potentially heavy ion suppression by co-extracted
interferences.

ACN, acetonitrile; IPA, isopropanol; DCM, dichloromethane; FA, formic
acid.

2.2 Effects
of Precipitation Salt and Ion-Pairing
Reagent on Sensitivity
Seeking an effective approach to reduce
co-extracted interferences and to increase the recovery, we examined
the effects of salt protein precipitation and an ion-pairing reagent
on sensitivity by adding 250 mg ammonium sulfate and 25 mM dibutylammonium
acetate (ion-pairing reagent) separately into two sets of parallel
samples. Subsequently, we performed LLE using 1.5 mL of acidified
methanol (0.5 mL milk sample, vortex shaking 10 min for three times
at room temperature). Unfortunately, these tests yielded no significant
improvement in sensitivity (Figure 3).

reagent
on sensitivity. Abbreviation: FA, formic acid.

2.3 Potential Chelation of Cannabinoids to Mineral
Ions
We further speculated that the low sensitivity might
be a result of potential chelation of cannabinoid molecules to mineral
ions (e.g., Ca2+ and Mg2+), as these ions are
relatively abundant in human breast milk11 and may have a non-negligible influence on recovery. If this were
the case, adding a chelating agent, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), would improve sensitivity by “freeing” cannabinoids
from metal ions by forming stronger chelates with the ions. We then
performed LLE with freshly prepared methanol containing 10 mM EDTA-Na2, 50 mM ammonium formate, and 5% formic acid (0.5 mL milk
sample, vortex shaking 10 min for three times at room temperature).
Despite higher MS spiking IS preparation efficiencies observed for
THC and CBD following this approach, preparation efficiencies (Figure 4) for all analytes
following these tests were still too low to detect trace-level cannabinoids
resulting from passive/light marijuana exposure. We conclude that
cannabinoid chelation to mineral ions is not a key factor influencing
extraction recovery (ER) and sensitivity.

chelation of cannabinoids to mineral ions.
Abbreviation: FA, formic acid.

2.4 Evaluation of Protein Digestion on Sensitivity
Before the LLE procedure, we evaluated the effect of protein digestion
on sensitivity using proteinase K (10 units/mL in the sample, incubated
at 37 °C for 2 h). If cannabinoids bind with milk proteins, this
procedure could potentially liberate cannabinoids from proteins, thus
increasing ER and sensitivity. After preparing the samples using the
LLE procedure (0.5 mL milk sample, 1.5 mL acidified methanol, vortex
shaking 10 min for three times at room temperature), we observed even
lower IS PE following the protein digestion procedure (Figure 5). The lower efficiency might
be caused by several factors: (1) cannabinoids could degrade during
the protein digestion procedure; (2) cannabinoids could bind to the
proteinase; and/or (3) the digested products could interfere with
MS ionization, resulting in ion suppression.

Figure 5 Protein digestion conducted
at different pH levels, followed by
LLE with 1.5 mL acidified methanol.

2.5 Minimization of the Influences of Lipids on
Sensitivity
Given that breast milk contains a large amount
of lipids, potentially up to 5% by weight,11 and that cannabinoids are highly lipophilic, we sought to determine
whether cannabinoid–lipid binding could be the cause of low
sensitivity. We also speculated that formation of esters between cannabinoids
and fatty acids could exist in breast milk, resulting in low recovery.
To test these hypotheses, we assessed alkaline saponification using
methanolic NaOH (details regarding experimental parameters are described
in Section 2.6).
In contrast to previous tests (Figures 2–5), we observed remarkable
improvement in IS PE following saponification (Figure 6). We believe two major mechanisms underlie
the improvement in sensitivity and efficiency. First is the conversion
of triacylglycerols into water-soluble materials. Triacylglycerols
account for >95% of breast milk lipids,11 and their conversion during saponification would reduce any triacylglycerol–cannabinoid
binding and also reduce any ion suppression attributable to triacylglycerols.
This might be true for similar interferences, as well. The second
mechanism is the liberation of cannabinoids from fatty acids during
saponification. If formation of esters between cannabinoids and fatty
acids exists, the separation of the two, by converting fatty acids
into sodium salts, would essentially eliminate the fatty acids from
extracts.

PE (%) with the volume of methanol; (b) change in the average PE with
saponification duration; and (c) change in the average PE with methanolic
NaOH concentration.

2.6 Optimization
of Alkaline Saponification
We optimized the saponification
procedure by evaluating methanolic
NaOH volume/concentration and saponification duration, while maintaining
the temperature at 70 °C (Figure 6). We found that adding 0.5 mL of 1.25 M methanolic
NaOH into each milk sample and incubating the sample for 30 min at
70 °C provided the highest MS sensitivity. The optimum saponification
solution consisted of an approximate sample/methanol ratio of 1.0
and a NaOH concentration of 0.57 M.

2.7 Combined
Analysis of Milk Samples with Low
and High Concentrations
Because milk samples from recent
active users may have concentrations of 12C-analyte isotope
far beyond the dynamic linear ranges of our MS detector, highly concentrated
samples normally need to be diluted and re-prepared. Inspired by the
study reported by Kotandeniya et al.,12 in which they combined the analysis of urinary cotinine and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol
(NNAL) using naturally occurring 13C-transitions and 12C-transitions, respectively, we simultaneously monitored
the 13C-analyte isotopes and used them to quantify high-concentration
samples exceeding the linear MS responses for 12C-analyte
isotopes to reduce the repetitive analysis rate because MRM transitions
for naturally occurring 13C-analytes are at low levels.
Although there are a number of studies which reported that the natural
abundance of the stable isotopes of carbon, that is, 13C/12C, was approximately constant in various plants and
grasses,13 no data are available regarding
the ratio of 13C/12C in marijuana plants. Thus,
this approach was based on the assumption that the natural abundance
of the stable isotopes of carbon, 13C and 12C, is approximately constant. We compared the concentrations quantified
on the basis of 12C-transitions with those acquired using 13C-transitions, and we observed excellent agreement between
them (Table 2). Because
this approach can be used to evaluate both passive and active marijuana
exposure, it would significantly reduce the rate of repetitive sample
preparation and facilitate sample analysis.

2.8 Performance
Evaluation of the Proposed Method
We evaluated method performance
and determined LODs and limits
of quantitation (LOQs) by preparing and analyzing 20 sets of 7 pools
(10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 300, and 500 pg/mL). We first determined the
standard deviation (SD) of each pool’s concentration, and then
we plotted the SD of each pool against the concentration, and finally
obtained S0 given as the Y intercepts. LODs and LOQs, calculated as 3S0 and 10S0, respectively, are presented
in Table 3. Figure 7 depicts chromatograms
of three samples with concentrations close to LODs. The sensitivity
achieved in this method for THC is at least 100-fold higher than literature
values (i.e., LOD of 1.5 ng/mL for THC).10 No analytical method is currently available for measuring CBD and
CBN in breast milk. For data reporting, we will be consistently using
LODs obtained on the basis of 12C-analyte isotopes, although
we used 13C-analyte isotopes to quantify high concentrations.
We believe the marked increase in sensitivity will play an essential
role in quantifying trace-level cannabinoids in breast milk resulting
from passive or nonrecent active maternal marijuana exposure in future
studies.

Figure 7 Representative chromatograms of milk samples with concentrations
close to LODs.

We used three sets of
samples at low, medium, and high concentrations
to determine optimized extraction recoveries, matrix effects (MEs),
and sample PE. Average extraction recoveries ranged from 9.4 to 60%,
sample PE was in the range of 3.1–61%, and the ion suppression
due to the ME varied from −67 to 29% (Table 3). Basically, we noticed that the recovery
and ME at low, medium, and high levels for THC, CBD, and CBN were
of comparable magnitudes, for example, PE for THC is in the range
from 7.5 to 8.3%. Compared to lower concentrations, these measures
(matrix effect and recovery) at higher concentrations are less important
because there are no detection issues at higher concentrations. Considering
there are few data available in the literature to get reliable ranges
of milk concentrations in general population, we used a high concentration
of 250 ng/mL as a representative level to obtain the average values
of recovery, ME, and sample PE in this study, although a level of
500 ng/mL was applied as the upper calibration end. A high upper calibration
level will be helpful to reduce the repetitive rates of sample preparation
and analysis.

The biggest challenge we met when developing this
analytical method
was that cannabinoids are highly lipophilic, and they can bind to
lipids in human milk very tightly. After reviewing the literature,
we only identified one study using the LLE method to separate THC
from milk matrix.10 We examined the LLE
method, and found it could not effectively extract the analytes from
milk matrix, although it still worked for samples from active users
as they had high concentrations, for example, above 1.0 ng/mL. We
examined kinds of tests as described in the article and found that
alkaline saponification of the milk samples is the only effective
way to obtain high sensitivity that is indispensable for quantifying
the concentrations of cannabinoids in milk samples from those persons
exposed to second-hand marijuana smoke. Although the recovery and
efficiency are low, this is the best method that can be achieved currently.
We are continuously investigating whether there will be alternative
approaches available in future, so as to improve the recovery, efficiency,
and ME.

Finally, we evaluated the accuracy and precision of
the proposed
method by conducting replicate analyses of QC samples over 12 consecutive
weeks. The validation results show excellent interday and intraday
accuracy (within ±10%) and imprecision (<10%) (Table 3).

3 Experimental
Methods
3.1 Chemicals and Materials
We purchased
high-purity methanol (≥99.9%), 2-propanol (≥99.9%),
formic acid (≥99.5%), and ammonium formate (≥99%) from
Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). We purchased liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) grade water (J.T. Baker, ≥99.9%)
and acetonitrile (Burdick & Jackson, ≥99.9%) from VWR (Radnor,
PA). We purchased ammonium sulfate, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid disodium salt dehydrate (EDTA-Na2), and 0.5 M dibutylammonium
acetate from Sigma-Aldrich Laboratories, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). We
purchased native and isotopically labeled standards, including THC,
THC-d3, CBD, CBD-d3, CBN, and CBN-d3 from Cerilliant (Round Rock, TX). We
bought the SPE (C18, 100 mg) column and 96-well plate from Phenomenex
(Torrance, CA). All chemicals were used without further purification.

3.2 Standard Solution Preparation
Human
breast milk purchased from BioreclamationIVT (New York) was screened
and used as blank matrix for calibration and quality control (QC)
samples. The CDC Human Subjects Review Board determined that the use
of breast milk from anonymous individuals for method development was
not human subject research.

We prepared working solutions for
calibrators and QC samples from serial dilutions of primary stock
solutions with 60% methanol in water and stored these solutions in
Teflon-capped amber glass vials at −24 °C. Calibrators
(0.001–500 ng/mL) and QC samples (0.15, 25, and 250 ng/mL)
were created by spiking 50 μL of each working solution into
500 μL of milk pool. Concentrations for THC-d3, CBD-d3, and CBN-d3 in the internal standard (IS) spiking solution
were 0.01, 0.03, and 0.01 ng/μL, respectively.

3.3 Sample Preparation
We prepared calibrators,
QC samples, batch blanks, and unknown samples following the same procedures.
First, milk samples stored at temperatures ≤−65 °C
were thawed and gently vortex-mixed for 5 min at room temperature.
A sample volume of 0.50 mL was transferred to each 2.0 mL microcentrifugation
vial, followed by the addition of 50 μL of calibrator and QC
working solutions to each sample. Working solutions were replaced
with water for blanks and unknown samples. Then, 50 μL of IS
solution and 0.50 mL of 1.25 M methanolic NaOH were added to each
vial. After gentle mixing, the vials were incubated at 70 °C
for 15 min, mixed a second time, and then incubated for an additional
15 min at 70 °C. After cooling and equilibrating at 4 °C
for 1 h, samples were gently vortex-mixed and centrifuged for 30 min
at −6 °C, and then approximately 0.90 mL of clear solution
was transferred into a 96-deep well plate in order. After adding 0.4
mL of water into each well and gentle mixing, samples were loaded
onto a 96-well SPE plate, preconditioned with 1.0 mL of methanol and
1.0 mL of water. After soaking for 15 min, the mixtures were pushed
through the SPE under approximately 1.0 psi positive pressure. Samples
were subsequently washed with 1.0 mL of water and 1.0 mL of methanol
and water (v/v: 60:40). After drying for 15 min with nitrogen (25
psi), 1.0 mL of methanol was added to each sample. Then, the eluent
was collected in a second 96-well plate and dried using nitrogen on
a TurboVap evaporator (Biotage, Charlotte, NC) at room temperature.
The residuals were reconstituted in 50 μL of methanol and water
(v/v: 50:50), and 10 μL of each sample was injected into the
UPLC system.

3.4 Instrumentation and Operation
We
used a Shimadzu UPLC system (Columbia, MD) with a Kinetex reversed-phase
column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, particle size 2.6 μm, C18) (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA) to achieve chromatographic separation. The gradient
program contained 5.0 mM of ammonium formate with 0.05% formic acid
(solvent A), and 100% acetonitrile (solvent B). We maintained the
column flow rate at 0.4 mL/min and the temperature at 40 °C throughout
the analysis. To minimize MS contamination, we directed the LC flow
during the first 2.75 min and the last 1.5 min to a waste container,
using the incorporated switching valve on MS, and only allowed the
flow occurring between 2.75 and 4.5 min to the MS. Detailed gradient
elution programs are shown in Table 1.

We performed MS/MS analysis using a Sciex triple quadrupole 6500
with a TurboIonSpray source (Foster City, CA). We used positive electrospray
ionization (ESI+) mode to acquire MRM transition data for
THC and CBD, and ESI– mode for CBN. Because the
MS response of some 12C-analyte isotopes may exceed the
dynamic linear response of our MS detector, we also monitored naturally
occurring 13C-analyte isotopes. If the response of the 12C-isotope exceeded the linear response of the MS, the 13C-isotope was used for quantification. Monitoring of 13C-isotopes allowed quantification of samples that would have
required dilution and repeat preparation for quantification using
the 12C-analyte isotopes. Two MRM transitions for each
native analyte and one transition for the isotope labeled IS were
simultaneously monitored. Optimum MS source parameters were as follows:Source temperature: 600 °C.

Ionspray voltage (ESI+/ESI–): 5500/–4500 V.

Ion source gas-1: 80 psi.

Ion source
gas-2: 90 psi.

Curtain gas: 35 psi.

Target scan time (ESI+/ESI–): 0.19/0.18 s.

3.5 Determination
of ER, Overall Efficiency, and
ME
We determined ER, ME, and sample PE using three sets of
samples at low (0.15 ng/mL for THC and CBN; 0.30 ng/mL for CBD), medium
(25 ng/mL), and high (250 ng/mL) concentrations, as described elsewhere.14 In the first set, seven blank samples were fortified
with native and deuterated IS solutions at the beginning of the sample
preparation. In the second set of seven blank samples, spiking solutions
were added immediately before LC injection. The third set of seven
samples were prepared by spiking native and IS solutions in methanol
and water (v/v: 50:50). The ER, ME, and PE values were calculated
as follows      where A, B, and C were average
peak areas
of set 1, set 2, and set 3, respectively
(Table 3).

b Abbreviations: LOD, limit of
detection;
LOQ, limit of quantitation; RSD, relative standard deviation; R2, correlation coefficient of calibration plots.

3.6 Software
for Data Acquisition
We
used Analyst software (version 1.6.2) to acquire the chromatogram
and quantify the concentration. Calibration curves were constructed
using peak area ratios of analytes to the corresponding ISs for each
batch via linear least-squares regression with a 1/x weighting factor.
