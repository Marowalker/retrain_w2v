Two-dimensional materials (2DMs)
have high potential in gas sensing,
due to their large surface-to-volume ratio. However, most sensors
based on 2DMs suffer from the lack of a steady state during gas exposure,
hampering sensor calibration. Here, we demonstrate that analysis of
the time differential of the signal output enables the calibration
of chemiresistors based on platinum or tungsten diselenide (PtSe2, WSe2) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which present nonstationary behavior. 2DMs are synthesized by
thermally assisted conversion of predeposited metals on a silicon/silicon
dioxide substrate and therefore are integrable with standard complementary
metal–oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. We analyze the
behavior of the sensors at room temperature toward nitrogen dioxide
(NO2) in a narrow range from 0.1 to 1 ppm. This study overcomes
the problem of the absence of steady-state signals in 2DM gas sensors
and thus facilitates their usage in this highly important application.

Introduction
The monitoring of toxic
and flammable gases at low concentration
is challenging, especially in domestic and industrial environments.1 Among the waste species produced nowadays, nitrogen
dioxide (NO2) represents one of the most common exhaust
gases as it is usually obtained from numerous industrial applications.
This oxidizing gas can have a severe effect on human health, particularly
in terms of permanent damage to the respiratory system, even at concentration
levels as low as 1 ppm (parts per million).2,3 As
such, gas sensors capable of detecting extremely low concentrations
are highly sought after.4 Over the previous
few decades, metal oxides (MOx) have shown
their potential as sensing materials due to their high sensitivity
to pollutant gases, small size of devices, and low cost.1,5 However, it is known that MOx-based
sensors only perform well when working at temperatures typically higher
than 400 °C, with consequent huge consumption of energy.5−8

Sensors based on low-dimensional materials, including carbon
nanotubes,
graphene, and black phosphorus, have been widely investigated as promising
alternatives to MOx.2,9−152,9−15 Semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDCs) have been widely investigated as promising gas-sensing materials
due to their high surface-to-volume ratio, favorable surface energy
levels for gas adsorption, high mobilities, and high current on/off
ratios.16−19 A number of TMDCs have shown low detection limits for NO2 operating at room temperature (RT).19−23 Recently, platinum diselenide (PtSe2)
has gained huge interest for selective NO2 sensing with
a low limit of detection (LOD) in the range of few ppb and an extremely
fast response time (few seconds) when exposed to 0.1 ppm.24,25

However, most gas sensors based both on TMDCs and other low-dimensional
materials suffer significantly from drawbacks such as the lack of
a steady state during the gas exposure and slow recovery kinetics.
These two hindrances can hamper the use of sensors since two characteristic
parameters, the response time and the signal variation, cannot be
properly determined.26,27 In previous reports,28−30 we have demonstrated that the limitations can be overcome simply
by analyzing the time differential of the signal output (TDSO) instead
of the output itself. In those papers, the sensing material consisted
of multilayered graphene (MLG), synthesized through different routes.

Here, we demonstrate the reliability of the TDSO approach applying
it to chemiresistors (CRs) based on three different TMDCs: platinum
diselenide (PtSe2), tungsten diselenide (WSe2), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The sensors show continuously
rising current during a gas exposure longer than 2 min, similar to
those based on MLG.28−31 By means of TDSO, we are able to properly calibrate and compare
the sensors, highlighting the promising potentialities of these materials
in the field of gas sensors working at room temperature (RT).

Results
and Discussion
Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) results reported
in our previous publications show the stochiometric transformation
of Pt, Mo, and W into PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2, respectively, by thermally assisted conversion (TAC).20−22,25,32−34 Here, we present the application of TDSO to the devices
based on TMDCs reported in those papers, in which a detailed characterization
of TMDCs is presented.

Figure 1 shows the
optical images and the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices based on the aforementioned
TMDCs. The linearity of the I–V characteristics (Figure 1b,c) recorded for the investigated devices suggests that the
possibility that Schottky barriers at the contacts to the PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2 films can be excluded.
For the PtSe2-based devices, the values of sheet resistance
(RS) are in the range of a few hundred
kΩ/sq (Table 1). The variance of the resistance values can likely be attributed
to thickness variation and roughness of the sputtered Pt film at the
nanoscale level.

Figure 2a illustrates
the real-time current behavior (black line) of PtSe2-CR
#1 upon sequential exposures of NO2 (red rectangles). The
signals recorded for the other tested PtSe2-based devices
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

In each exposure window, the current shows an increasing
signal,
never reaching the stationary state, especially for NO2 concentrations higher than 0.5 ppm. Similar results are reported
elsewhere.28−31 The lack of a steady state is more evident in Figure 2b, where the signals recorded upon exposure
to different concentrations are grouped. It can be seen that the variation
of the current toward 100 ppb of NO2 (black curve) is almost
negligible compared to the others at higher concentrations.

Figure 2b also shows
that the higher the concentration of the injected gas, the smaller
the return of the current to the initial state. Noteworthily, based
on the definition of the term “recovery” as the time
required to reduce the stationary signal value by 90%,26 we need to carefully adopt this term to describe
the restoration of the signal after the gas pulse. At concentrations
lower than 0.5 ppm, the current value is almost restored to the initial
value in 150 s. When the sensor is exposed to the highest concentration
(1 ppm), for instance, the current is lowered by less than 30% from
the value reached when the gas is removed. These outcomes straightforwardly
point out two features: first, the continuous integrating capability
of the sensors and second, the difficulty in removing the adsorbed
molecules in a timescale feasible for applications in environmental
conditions.28 These two limitations, which
commonly affect the sensors based on 2D materials, are mathematically
overcome by the TDSO approach.28 In Figure 3a, the method is
applied to the signal recorded on device #1. The TDSO (red curve)
is overlapped upon the transients of the sensor (black line), where I0 and I represent the values
of the current when the gas is injected and stopped, respectively,
during each exposure. The TDSO peaks are well distinguishable for
each gas pulse except at 0.1 ppm (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 (a) Real-time percentage current variation (black
curve) of CR
#1 during the exposure to increasing concentrations of NO2 and corresponding TDSO (red curve). Analogous results are obtained
for the other seven devices (see the Supporting Information). (b) Maxima of the differential curves determined
for the eight devices (see the Supporting Information) and plotted as a function of the NO2 concentration.

At that concentration, the peak is not well visible
because of
the small variation of the signal (Figure 2b). As the rise time of the sensor is in
the range of tens of seconds, the TDSO peaks are located quite close
to the position of the gas inlet (t0),
as mathematically modeled in ref (28) (Figure S2).

The maxima of TDSO plotted as a function of the NO2 concentration
in the range 0.2–1.0 ppm (Figure 3b) display comparable behavior for the complete
set of sensors, especially in terms of linearity of the fitting curves.
To properly compare the performance of the sensors, the most powerful
tool is differential sensitivity (DS), defined as the slope of the
calibration curve.28 Further studies are
ongoing to address the definition of the limit of detection through
the TDSO approach. For the eight devices investigated in this paper,
the values of the DS are comparable within a maximum variation of
about 20% (Table 1).

To further prove the reliability of the TDSO approach, we tested
CRs based on MoS2 and WSe2. Figure 4 reports the calibration curves
obtained by applying TDSO on both sensors. For MoS2-CR
(Figure 4a), the peaks
were determined from the same test protocol (inset of Figure 4a) used for PtSe2-CRs. WSe2-CR, instead, was revealed to be scarcely sensitive
to NO2 concentrations lower than 0.4 ppm, showing no intense
TDSO peaks (inset of Figure 4b). As such, we slightly modified the protocol, exposing the
WSe2-CR up to 5 ppm of NO2.

Figure 4 Calibration curves of
(a) MoS2- and (b) WSe2-based CR. The insets
show the transients upon sequential NO2 exposures and TDSO,
respectively, in black and red.

Because of the decreasing current shown by both sensors, we reported
the absolute values of the TDSO peaks as a function of the NO2 concentration. The n- or p-type behavior of MoS2 is already shown in other reports,22,35,36 while we are further investigating the behavior of
WSe2. Nevertheless, in the present paper, we mostly focus
on TDSO to overcome the calibration issue. The linearity of the calibration
curve first confirms the reliability of the TDSO approach. The DS
of MoS2-CR (0.6 ± 0.1 nA/(s·ppm)) indicates that
TAC-grown MoS2 is slightly more sensitive than TAC-grown
PtSe2 toward NO2 in the investigated range.

A fairer comparison between the results presented here and those
reported in the literature can be based on the minimum detectable
concentration of gas. Except for the WSe2-based CR, the
sensors presented here are able to distinguish down to a hundred ppb
of NO2 working at RT. These findings are in close agreement
with up to date results.16,25,37 By further refinement of the materials synthesis route, it is very
likely that the detectable gas concentration will be lowered significantly.

Conclusions
We have analyzed the sensing properties of chemiresistors based
on PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2 toward NO2. The devices were able to detect concentrations of NO2 in N2 down to few hundred ppb at RT. We addressed
the issue of a nonstationary state shown during the gas exposure by
applying the TDSO approach. We definitively proved that the maxima
of TDSO are uniquely and linearly correlated with the NO2 concentration in the range 0.1–1 ppm. The TDSO approach allowed
us to properly calibrate the sensors based on three different TMDCs,
showing the potential of these materials in the field of gas sensors
operating at RT.

Experimental Section
Films of PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2 were synthesized by
thermally assisted conversion (TAC) of Pt, Mo,
and W, respectively. Thin layers of Pt (0.5 nm), Mo (10 nm), and W
(20 nm) were sputtered onto SiO2 (300 nm)/Si substrates.
The samples were then loaded into a quartz tube furnace and heated
at 400, 750, and 600 °C, respectively. The vapors of the chalcogens
were produced at ∼115 °C (S) and ∼220 °C (Se)
and diffused into the metal layers to form PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2, respectively. The TAC process is described
in detail in previous reports.20,21,25

To fabricate the gas sensors, we used shadow masks to sputter
Pt,
Mo, and W layers only on selected areas. After the synthesis of patterned
PtSe2, MoS2, and WSe2 by the TAC
process, metal contacts (Ni/Au for PtSe2 or WSe2, Ti/Au for MoS2) were deposited using hard masks to define
the sensing areas.21,25 For instance, Figure 1 illustrates the PtSe2-based CRs. Each device is about 1 × 0.2 mm2. The
electrical measurements were performed using a Keithley 2636 Source
Meter Unit and a Keithley 3706 System Switch/Multimeter. We tested
the gas sensors based on TMDC in a custom-made chamber with a volume
of about 10 cL and remote-controllable mass-flow controllers (MFCs).
The pressure and temperature were kept constant at 150 Torr and room
temperature (RT). A constant flow of the gas mixture (100 sccm) was
flushed in the chamber. We injected 10 ppm of NO2 into
the test chamber, diluting it with dry nitrogen (N2) to
achieve concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 ppm. Each of the ten
gas pulses and subsequent recovery steps lasted 150 s. The sensors
were biased at 1 V. The resistance of the devices upon the periodic
gas exposure was simultaneously monitored.
