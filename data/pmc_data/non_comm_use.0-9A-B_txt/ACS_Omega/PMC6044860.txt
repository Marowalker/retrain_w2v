Tracking
dynamic cellular processes necessitates fluorescent materials
that are photostable, biocompatible, water-soluble, nanosized, and
nontoxic. In this study, highly fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) were
produced from cheap and readily available sources, citric acid (CA)
and Philippine citrus (Citrus japonica Thunb.) or calamansi juice (CJ) via a microwave-assisted method.
A number of synthetic conditions were investigated systematically
to optimize the preparation of CDs from CA and CJ. The formation mechanism,
surface chemistry, and photoluminescence of CA-based CDs (CA-CDs)
and CJ-based CDs (CJ-CDs) were evaluated after each stage of pyrolysis
in detail using different characterization techniques, such as dynamic
light scattering, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy,
ζ potential, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
and absorption/emission spectroscopy. Gram-scale pyrolysis of CA with
ethylenediamine (EDA) and CJ with EDA were carried out to provide
CA-CDs (CA-18) within 18 min total pyrolysis time at 97% yield and
CJ-CDs (CJ-14) within 14 min total pyrolysis time at 7% yield. Aqueous
suspensions of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs gave comparable bright blue luminescence
at 462 nm. CA-CDs were shown to be nontoxic for mung beans up to 2
mg/mL, whereas CJ-CDs with higher surface negative charges inhibited
growth above 0.5 mg/mL. This study demonstrates that bright CA- and
CJ-CDs can be produced in gram-scale quantities using inexpensive
methods. The size, amount, and extent of EDA incorporation are important
in contributing to the formation of highly emissive particles.

Introduction
Carbon nanodots, also
known as carbon dots (CDs), are a new class
of discrete quasispherical amorphous particles richly decorated with
surface oxygen/nitrogen groups.1 CDs have
become one of the most studied nanomaterials during the past decade
due to their promising properties. CDs exhibit unique optical and
thermal characteristics, chemical stability, biocompatibility, water
solubility, and tunable surface functionalities. These properties
enable the application of CDs in the fields of chemical sensing, biological
monitoring, drug delivery, catalysis, photovoltaic devices, and optoelectronic
devices.1−6 For example, because of the superior optical properties of CDs and
their compatibility with different cell lines (e.g., T47D,7 MCF-7, HT-29,8 HeLa,9 and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma10) and sprouts,11 these can potentially
replace other photoluminescent materials like fluorescent dye probes
and quantum dots (such as, CdSe and PbS) in sensing, cell tracking,
and bioimaging.2 Fluorescent dye probes
have been traditionally used for imaging but may photobleach after
long exposures. Quantum dots became popular choices; however, their
high production cost and toxicity inherent in these systems limit
their applications in biomedicine.7,8

CDs have
been accessed using different methods via the top-down
or bottom-up approach.2−5 In the top-down approach, CDs are formed from the breakdown of larger
C structures, such as carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, fullerene,
or graphite electrodes, utilizing any of these methods such as arc
discharge, laser ablation, electrochemical synthesis, or plasma. Conversely,
in the bottom-up approach, CDs are formed from fusion of small molecular
precursors or polycyclic aromatics via stepwise organic synthesis,
combustion, hydrothermal treatment, acidic oxidation, or microwave or ultrasound methods.
Among the different techniques under the bottom-up approach, the microwave
method offers a simple, scalable, cost-effective, and facile manner
to access CDs.1,3,4,9,12−18

Even with these different techniques, challenge remains in
scaleup
preparation of photoluminscent CDs in a short period of time.19 Aside from the treatment method and carbon source
consideration, scalable highly photoluminescent CDs can be obtained
by overcoming the challenges such as carbon aggregation, size, surface
chemistry, and exact chemical identity.9,19,20 Size control and uniformity of properties have been
previously addressed by post-treatment, such as polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis,21 filtration,8 column chromatography,11,22 or centrifugation10/dialysis.6,9,23 Conversely, surface properties
are critical for solubility, as well as altering the electronic density
for tuning the optoelectronic properties and for selected applications.
Surface properties of CDs can be modified by surface functionalization24−27 with amines9,14,28 or passivation,29,30 doping,31 cross-linking,32 or other post-treatments.

Among the different CDs reported, citric acid (CA) with amines
like ethylenediamine (EDA) provided CDs with some of the highest quantum
yields (QYs) (i.e., 9%33 using direct pyrolysis;
30.2,14 44,18 and 52%20 using microwave; 8019 and 94%34 using hydrothermal
treatment). CDs prepared without the presence of amines show only
low emission intensities.14 Because CA
has been a well-studied CD precursor, in addition to having high quantum
yield in the presence of EDA, we chose CA as our carbon precursor
to benchmark the results obtained with another CA-rich carbon source,
calamansi juice (CJ, from Citrus japonica Thunb., family of Rutaceae). Calamansi is a citrus fruit found in
several regions, such as, Southeast Asia, India, West Indies, and
Central and North America. Its juice (CJ) possesses the aroma of orange
and the zesty taste of lime and is commonly used as food seasoning
or as food additive. CA (50 g/L) is one of the major organic acids
found in CJ, whereas the other organic acids, ascorbic (0.36 g/L),
malic (2.13 g/L), and succinic (1.48 g/L), are found in trace amounts.
CJ of the Philippine variety has a juice titratable acidity (% CA)
of 5.66 ± 0.07%.36 Aside from organic
acids, CJ also contains sugars (e.g., fructose, glucose, and sucrose)
and free and/or bound phenolic acids (e.g., caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids).36 CJ has also been shown, in a preliminary study,37 to possess CDs with higher emission intensities compared
to those from other carbon sources, such as orange,
dalandan, and suha/pomelo juice (data not shown).

Unique to
other studies, we address some of the challenges in CD
preparation by a systematic study on how to inexpensively scale up
CD production, focusing also on the time required to synthesize these
materials via a kitchen microwave. In addition, the formation mechanism
of CDs was investigated utilizing two different carbon sources (CA
and CJ) as these are pyrolyzed over time. The particle size and surface
chemistry of the pyrolysis products were monitored to understand how
highly photoluminescent CDs are formed. Hence, the preparation of
CDs from CA and CJ was optimized using a microwave-assisted method
by varying the microwave power, sample volume, heating time pattern,
amines utilized, and the concentration of CA and amines. We also described
the approach we utilized to reproducibly scale up the CD synthesis
to gram-scale quantities (100 mL of 0.1 g CA/mL deionized (DI) water
or CJ) in a short period of time. The mechanism of formation, size,
surface chemistry, and photoluminescence of CA-based CDs (CA-CDs)
and CJ-based CDs (CJ-CDs) were also investigated via the time study
approach using different characterization techniques (i.e., dynamic
light scattering (DLS), ζ potential, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
(DOSY), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, photoluminescence
emission spectroscopy, dispersibility, and stability of the CA- and
CJ-CDs at different pHs (acidic, physiologic, and basic)). Finally,
we used the viability of mung beans to examine the toxicity of CA
and CJ-CDs.

Results and Discussion
Establishing Preliminary CD Synthesis Parameters
CA-CDs
were prepared using microwave pyrolysis by varying the microwave power
at a fixed concentration of 0.1 g/mL of CA in water. Two settings
were selected to determine the microwave power conditions, 50% (equivalent
to 430 W) and 70% (equivalent to 630 W). These power settings fall
within the range where CDs were obtained in previous studies.9,13,14,16−18 CA solutions of 1, 3, 5, and 7 mL sample volumes were pyrolyzed in a 5 min (min)
repetitive heating pattern using a microwave until red-brown solids
were obtained. Extreme sample sputtering was observed from the vials
with 5 and 7 mL sample volumes, resulting in losses. As a result,
1, 2, and 3 mL initial sample volumes were used and CDs were obtained
after four to six times 5 min repetitive heating (Table S1). Using 50 or 70% power at 1, 2, and 3 mL, pale yellow
solids were obtained with average product yields between 32 and 87%.
Comparable to the microwave power conditions carried out
by Zhai14 with CA and EDA at 700 W, Qu17 using CA and urea at 750 W, and Du18 using CA and EDA at 720 W for pyrolysis; the
CDs formed using 70% (630 W) power and 3 mL initial sample volume
provided the highest photoluminescence intensities with peak maxima
at 462 nm. Hence, these conditions were utilized for the succeeding
experiments.

Using 70% power and 3 mL of CA stock solution of
concentration 0.1 g/mL, we investigated the effect of pyrolysis time
pattern on CD synthesis. Since a 5 min repetitive heating used during
the initial optimization trapped excessive heat and steam inside the
microwave, a 2 min repetitive time pattern was tested. CDs synthesized
at 70% power with the 3 mL sample using 0.1 g/mL CA at 2 min repetitive
heating provided CDs with highest photoluminescence intensities among
the series (Table S1).

Amine-passivated
CDs have been shown to provide increased fluorescence
emission compared to that from CDs pyrolyzed in the absence of amines.14,33,35 Different amine-passivating agents
(primary, secondary, tertiary, and aromatic amines) were tested using
the 3 mL sample solution of 1:1 molar ratio (CA/amine) at 70% power
and 2 min repetitive heating pattern (Table S1). Diethylamine (CA_DEA; fluorescence emission at 462 nm = 17.1 au)
and triethylamine (CA_TEA = 38.6 au) did not lead to significant fluorescence
enhancement compared with CDs with no amine (CA_no amine = 12.9 au).
However, EDA (CA_EDA = 2130 au) and quinine-passivated samples (CA_quinine
= 1338 au) provided enhanced fluorescence emission. From the results,
even when CA-quinine provided one of the highest
emission intensities, the quinine only pyrolyzed sample (quinine =
14.3 au) inherently possesses low fluorescence emission intensity,
this may interfere with the emission results when used as amine passivating
agent. Conversely, triethylamine molecules were only N-doped on the
CD surface, whereas EDA and DEA have available nitrogen groups that
can form amide bonds with the carboxylic acid moieties of CA, in addition
to its nitrogen atoms being incorporated into the carbon core during
heating.14 Thus, these amines enhanced
the photoluminescence of the CDs, with EDA giving the highest photoluminesence
enhancement effect on the CD due to its dual role as N-doping precursors
and surface passivation agents. The presence of amide bonds is evident
in the FT-IR analysis (Figure S1).

EDA, one of the widely used passivating agents, has been shown
to produce bright blue fluorescent CDs with CA.14,18,19,33,35 The UV–vis spectrum provides a weak absorption
band at 353 nm and a peak at 200 nm with a corresponding shoulder
peak at 237 nm, whereas the CA-only sample gives a low absorption
peak at 200 nm and no peak at 353 nm (Figure 1A). The CA-EDA sample solution is clear under
normal light but produced a bright blue light under UV (365 nm). A
photoluminescence emission peak at 462 nm (recorded highest peak)
was observed upon excitation of an aqueous solution of CA-EDA at 355
nm, which is in
contrast to the absence of peak at 462 nm for CA-only samples (Figure 1B). The coexistence
of N-doping and the formation of surface amide groups contributed
to the fluorescence enhancement of the CDs. This enhancement was also
higher than that provided by DEA due to the presence of more amine
groups capable of forming surface amide groups with CDs. It is notable
that solutions obtained from pyrolyzed CA-only (12.9 au) or EDA-only
(5.4 au) samples provided low fluorescence emission intensities but
the combined pyrolysis of the two gave samples with high photoluminescence
intensity. In a different study, EDA also significantly enhanced the
CD photoluminescence intensity, from an emission intensity of less
than 25 au to 3686 au (see CA-1G vs CAEDA-1G, Table S1). This indicated that EDA effectively doped and passivated
the CA-CDs, which resulted in high fluorescence emissions. With these
findings, only EDA was utilized as the amine additive in the next
experiments.

Figure 1 Representative (A) UV–vis absorption spectrum of
0.1 g CD/mL
DI water and (B) photoluminescence emission spectrum of 1.2 mg CD/mL
DI water. CA CDs were prepared with EDA (348 μL of EDA and 0.1
g/mL CA in DI water, for 10 mL) and without EDA (0.1 g/mL DI water)
using 70% microwave power at 2 min repetitive heating and 3 mL sample
volume (see Table S1).

The amount of carbon source (i.e., the concentration of CA
stock
solution) and the concentration of passivating agent (EDA) were varied.
The CDs were synthesized at varying CA concentrations: 0.5, 1, 1.5,
3, and 5 g CA in DI water (10 mL) while keeping the EDA concentration
constant, i.e., 348 μL. Pyrolysis was conducted using 70% power,
3 mL sample volume, and 2 min repetitive heating. Photoluminescence
intensity slightly increased from sample CAEDA-0.5G (0.5 g CA/10 mL
of DI water) (3609 au) to CA-EDA-1G (3686 au) and then decreased significantly
as the CA concentration was increased to 1.5 g CA/10 mL of DI water
(CAEDA-1.5G, 2496 au). Using CAEDA-3G and CAEDA-5G, low emission intensities
of less than 200 au were obtained (Table S1). These results indicate that increasing the CA amount does not
provide CDs with enhanced emission. CAEDA-1G provided CDs with the
highest photoluminescence intensity and a higher yield of 100% (calculated
based on the amount of CA) compared with 60% for CAEDA-0.5G.

The presence of EDA not only significantly enhances the CD emission
intensity but also shortens the pyrolysis time from 22 min (CA-0.5G)
to 16 min (CAEDA-0.5G), from 32 min (CA-1G) to 22 min (CAEDA-1G),
from 26 min (CA-1.5G) to 16 min (CAEDA-1.5G), from 18 min (CA-3G)
to 12 min (CAEDA-3G), and from 22 min (CA-5G) to 12 min (CAEDA-5G).
Addition of EDA shortens the synthesis time for at least 6–10
min (Table S1).

Likewise, the amount
of EDA was varied while keeping the CA concentration
constant at 0.1 g/mL in DI water (10 mL) at 1:0.25 (0.1 g/mL CA solution/86.9
μL EDA, CAEDA-0.25), 1:0.5 (0.1 g/mL:173.37 μL, CAEDA-0.50),
1:1.00 (0.1 g/mL:348 μL, CAEDA-1.00), 1:1.50 (0.1 g/mL:521 μL,
CAEDA-1.50), and 1:2.00 (0.1 g/mL:695 μL, CAEDA-2.00). CDs synthesized
with 1:1 CA/EDA molar ratio (CAEDA-1.00) provided the highest photoluminescence
intensity at 462 nm with 3686 au, followed by CAEDA-2.00 (2945 au)
and then CAEDA-1.50 (2418 au). CAEDA-0.25 and CAEDA-0.50 gave CDs
with low emission intensities (<400 au) (Table S1).

CJ-CDs were also prepared at varying amounts of
EDA concentration
(Table S1). CDs were pyrolyzed using pure
CJ and EDA at 70% power, 3 mL sample volume, and 2 min repetitive
heating with the CJ/EDA ratios of 1:0.25 (10 mL CJ/86.9 μL EDA,
CJEDA-0.25), 1:0.50 (10 mL:173.37 μL, CJEDA-0.50), 1:1.00 (10
mL:348 μL, CJEDA-1.00), 1:1.50 (10 mL:521 μL, CJEDA-1.50),
and 1:2.00 (10 mL:695 μL, CJEDA-2.00). The photoluminescence
intensity increased with increasing amine concentration from CJEDA-0.25
(41 au) to CJEDA-1.50 (2285 au) but decreased as the amine concentration
was further increased.

Gram-Scale Synthesis of CA- and CJ-CDs
Access to gram-scale
quantities of CDs having uniform particle size and surface chemistry
with high photoluminescent emission remains a challenge.19 Herein, we varied the sample volume from small scale 3 mL in small vials, to 50 and 100 mL in
large beakers to examine the large-scale synthesis. Pyrolysis of the
small-scale sample, CAEDA-3 mL, took longer (22 min), followed by
CAEDA-50 mL (12 min) and CAEDA-100 mL (18 min) (Table S2). Pyrolysis of a larger amount of sample volume gave
higher amounts of CA CDs, starting from CAEDA-3 mL, 0.316 g (100%
yield), to CAEDA-50 mL, 4.88 g (98% yield), and CAEDA-100 mL, 9.93
g (99% yield) (Table S2). Both the UV absorption
and photoluminescence emission intensities of CA-CDs produced using
CAEDA-50 mL (emission at 462 nm = 3461 au) and CAEDA-100 mL (3759
au) were comparable with those of CAEDA-3 mL (3578 au) (Figure 2). The repeatability of the
synthesis was evaluated using six trials of CAEDA solutions at 100
mL, with a total heating time of 18 min at 2 min repetitive heating
(CA-18). The results showed that the yields for the six trials are
almost quantitative (Table S3). All of
the CA with EDA-pyrolyzed samples showed characteristic absorbance
peaks at 200 with a shoulder peak at around 240 nm and a broad peak
at 350 nm and photoluminescence emission between 420 and 600 nm with
a maximum emission intensity at 462 nm (Figure 3). The average photoluminescence emission
for the six samples was 3724 ± 165 au. Even though the CDs obtained
can be easily dispersed in water, the effect of centrifugation on
the spectroscopic properties of the samples was also examined because
smaller particles were shown to provide higher photoluminescent emission
than that from coarser ones.23 Hence, separation
of “bigger” particles through centrifugation should
be beneficial. The same CA CDs from trials 1–5 (repeatability
test) were used for this study, except that the samples were subjected
to centrifugation. Results showed no visible particles settled and
the emission intensity of the resulting CA CD supernatant (average
= 3670 ± 247 au) was comparable to that of samples that were
not subjected to centrifugation. In addition, CDs subjected to a dialysis
membrane (Spectra/Por 7, 1000 molecular weight cut-off) for 48 h also
provided comparable emission intensities for both samples subjected
to or without dialysis.37 Thus, these results
showed that CA-CDs can be reproduced in gram quantities.

CJ-14 CD/mL DI water from different trials. (D) Photoluminescence
emission spectra of 1.2 mg CJ-14 CD/mL DI water. Samples were excited
using a 355 nm laser (see Table S3).

Gram-scale synthesis of CJ-CDs
was carried out using 100 mL sample
volume with 1:1 molar ratio (100 mL CJ/3480 μL EDA) and pyrolyzed
at 70% power (630 W) at 2 min repetitive heating. Results showed that
freshly extracted CJ has a higher emission intensity at 462 nm (3743
au) compared to that of the old CJ (3077 au), which was extracted
for at least 2 weeks and kept refrigerated before pyrolysis. Repeatability
study was carried out using six trials containing fresh CJ obtained
from different calamansi fruit sources and EDA. Pyrolysis was carried
out for 14 min at 2 min repetitive heating (CJ-14). Dark brown solids
weighing ∼7 g and an average yield of 7% were obtained from
the pyrolysis of the different trials (Table S3). Similar to CA-CDs, CJ-CDs also provided photoluminescence emission
between 420 and 600 nm with the highest emission point at 462 nm and
an intensity ranging from 3500 to 3900 au from the different samples
(average = 3816 ± 164 au) (Figure 3D). From these results, CJ-CDs were prepared in gram
quantities with emission intensities higher than those of CA CDs.
This is also supported by the higher quantum yield for CJ-14 (Φ
= 2.0%) compared to that for CA-18 (Φ = 1.7%) CDs using quinine
sulfate as standard.

Heating Time Study of the Formation of CA-
and CJ-CDs
Understanding the stages of transition toward
the formation of CDs
during microwave pyrolysis may allow facile identification of the
parameters required to achieve desired material properties. Herein,
we are interested in examining the properties such as the functionality
(the chemical identities of the CDs); the size, as the raw materials
transform to bright and highly photoluminescent CDs; and the mechanism
of formation of CDs. Several studies have reported on the possible
mechanisms associated with photoluminescence:30 quantum confinement, excitons of carbon,38 free zigzag sites and/or edge defects,39 emissive traps due to the presence of surface and/or molecular state
determined by hybridization of the carbon backbone and functional
moieties present upon surface passivation,13,19,29,40 conjugated
π domains41 on the surface or at
the core of the CDs,5,42 and the crosslink-enhanced emission
effect.32 However, the exact mechanism
of formation and the photoluminescence behavior of CDs from CA or
CJ with EDA are not completely clear.

Hence, a heating time
study was performed where solution samples that were not heated and
those heated at increments of 2–4 min toward the conversion
to CDs were analyzed. For CA, selected samples were pyrolyzed at 2
min increment for a total of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 min,
whereas for CJ, the samples were pyrolyzed at 2 min increment for
a total of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 min. Of the microwave power, 70%
was used for both CA and CJ. The samples were analyzed using UV–vis
absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The dispersibility
and pH stability tests for the CDs were performed. We further used
FT-IR and NMR spectroscopy to identify the evolution of surface functional
groups of CDs in the process of pyrolysis. The size, charge, and state
of the CDs were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS), diffusion-ordered
spectroscopy (DOSY), atomic force microscopy (AFM), ζ potential,
and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

As the pyrolysis time increased
from CA-0 (no heating) to CA-12
(CA sample pyrolyzed for a total of 12 min), the samples showed little
to no fluorescence when exposed under UV light (365 nm) (Figure 4A). After subjecting
the sample to 14, 16, 18, or 20 min pyrolysis (Figure 4A UV; CA-14, CA-16, CA-18, or CA-20, respectively),
the aqueous suspensions of the samples visualized under UV light showed
bright blue fluorescent solutions. Water has completely evaporated,
and sample CA-14 was already dry after pyrolysis. For CA-16, burnt
residues were already evident under normal light and the amount of
residue increased over time. All pyrolyzed CA samples gave a broad
UV absorption peak at 200 nm with a shoulder peak at 237 nm, which
can be ascribed to the π-to-π* transition of C=C
bonds or the carbonic core for CA-EDA (Figure S2A). The peak at 237 nm for CA-0 provided an absorption of
0.18. This peak dipped to a minimum with CA-12 (0) and peaked at CA-18
(0.30). However, sample CA-20 provided an absorbance of 0.06, less
than that of CA-18. These results indicated the changes occurring
on the carbonic core of the particles. However, even when CA-14 provided
a bright blue light under UV, only the samples pyrolyzed for more
than 18 min (CA-18) provided a weak n-to-π* absorption band
at 353 nm, indicative of the surface group (C=O) (Figure S2A). Photoluminescence emission spectra
provided the signature peak at 462 nm when the pyrolyzed samples (CA-14,
-16, -18, and -20) were excited at 355 nm (Figure S2B). This is similar to the results observed by Du18 and Zhu19 for CDs
obtained via microwave and hydrothermal pyrolysis using CA and EDA.
Samples CA-18 (3819 au) and CA-20 (3964 au) provided solutions with
high photoluminescence intensities among the series (Figure S2B). However, the photoluminescence intensity for
CA-20 was observed to be higher and the intensity of the UV absorption
band at 350 nm was lower compared to that of CA-18. DOSY results showed
that only CA-18 CDs were formed (Figure S7); this may suggest that further heating resulted into a more photoluminescent
system, but this does not mean that CDs are produced. Conversely,
CJ samples provided bright blue fluorescence under UV light only after
subjecting the sample to 10, 12, 14, or 16 min total pyrolysis time
(Figure 4B UV; CJ-10,
CJ-12, CJ-14, or CJ-16, respectively). From samples CJ-12 to CJ-14,
the yellow CJ was converted into a dark brown viscous solid (Figure 4B, normal). The UV
absorbance peaks at 237 and 350 nm for CJ-12, CJ-14, and CJ-16 have
comparable absorbance intensities. Conversely, this weak band at 350
nm was not evident for the other CJ samples (Figure S2C). Strong photoluminescence emission at 462 nm was apparent
only for samples pyrolyzed for a total time of 12, 14, and 16 min,
with the highest emission peak obtained with CJ-14 at 3778 au (Figure S2D). Pyrolyzed CA samples were obtained
as off white to tan-colored solids, whereas yellow to brown solids
were obtained for CJ samples. It is gratifying to note that CA and
CJ samples fluoresce under UV light both in aqueous and in dry solid
states, similar to that reported by Xu et al.43 using CDs produced with calcium citrate and urea.

CA and (B) CJ CD solutions after respective
heating time viewed under normal light (top) and UV light at 365 nm
(bottom). The CA samples (100 mL solution of 0.1 g CA and 3480 μL
EDA in DI water) were pyrolyzed at 2 min increment for a total of
4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 min; and CJ samples (100 mL of CJ
and 3480 μL EDA) were pyrolyzed at 2 min increment for a total
of 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 min using 70% microwave power (630 W).

The dispersibility of CA-18 and
CJ-14 CDs in different solvents
was explored using water (H2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH),
tetrahydrofuran (THF), hexane, toluene, chloroform (CHCl3), and methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) at room
temperature. These solvents were added to the CDs to obtain 1 mg/mL
solutions, separately. CA-18 CDs were readily dispersible in water,
DMSO, and DMF, providing clear solutions in 1 mL solvent (Figure S3A). However, CJ-14 CDs were dispersible
only in water (Figure S3B). The other test
solvents provided two separate phases. This suggested that the surface
of the CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs are hydrophilic.

The pH stability
can provide indirect information regarding the
photoluminescence origin of the sample.30 The UV absorbance and photoluminescence emission of CA-18 and CJ-14
CDs were obtained by suspending the CDs at pHs 2, 7.4, and 12 (Figure S4). The CDs were suspended separately,
and the absorbance was taken at the noted time (0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and
24 h) (Figure S5). The absorbance of CA-18
dispersed in neutral and basic environments for 0.5 h does not vary
over time (λmax = 349 nm) (Figure S4A). However, when CA-18 was suspended at pH 2, a slight red
shift to λmax = 353 nm compared to the results for
pHs 7.4 and 12 was obtained (Figure S4A). CA-18 CDs exhibited high photoluminescence emission under neutral
and basic pH environments (highest emission peak at 462 nm for pHs
7.4 and 12 and at 464 nm with shoulder peak for pH 2); however, the
photoluminescence intensity was slightly lower at pH 2 (Figure S4B). Even though, there was a decrease
in the observed intensity at pH 2, this is not as dramatic as the
results reported by Zhou et al.20 and Liu
et al.,13 wherein the presence of emissive
traps on the surface of the CDs obtained from polyol resulted into
low emission intensities at pHs 2 and 12. Conversely, Jin et al.24 reported that the protonation or deprotonation
of the functional groups on the CD can lead to shift in photoluminescence
using graphene quantum dots. Absorption results of CJ-14 CDs suspended
at pHs 7.4 and 12 were shown to be stable over time (λmax = 353 nm for pH 7.4 and 351 for pH 12) and those of CDs suspended
at pH 2 showed a slight red shift compared to the results for pHs
7.4 and 12 (λmax = 358 nm) (Figure S4C). The photoluminescence emission of CJ-14 CDs at pH 2 (464
nm) was comparable to that at pHs 7.4 and 12 (462 nm), where a shoulder
peak was evident for all of the samples (Figure S4D).

The FT-IR spectra of CA samples confirmed that
polar groups such
as O–H (3450 cm–1), N–H (3200 cm–1), and carbonyl groups (vide infra) are present on
the CD surfaces (Figure S1A), rendering
CA-18 CDs dispersible in water, DMSO, and DMF (Figure S3A). For CA-0, C=O stretching at 1720 cm–1, indicative of the presence of acid moieties, disappeared
when the sample was pyrolyzed for a longer time. Instead, a peak at
1640 cm–1, characteristic of the amide C=O
stretching, appeared starting at CA-14, and this peak became more
prominent over time. Small peaks characteristic of N–H bending
(1550 cm–1) and C–NH–C stretching
(1420 cm–1) were also observed. The disappearance
of O–H and N–H stretching may be due to dehydrolysis
of COOH moieties from CA, followed by amide bond formation between
CA and EDA. For CA-20, the longer pyrolysis time may have led to the
carbonization of the material. However, even when UV absorption at
350 nm for CA-20 was less intense than that for CA-18, its emission
intensity (3964 au) was higher than that for CA-18 (3819 au) (Figures S2A and S2B).

The FT-IR spectra
of CJ samples (CJ-0 to CJ-14) revealed that samples
possessed hydrophilic groups, such as O–H (3414 cm–1), N–H (3238 cm–1), carbonyl, and COC groups
(1192 cm–1) (Figure S1B). Peaks characteristic of N–H bending (1535 cm–1) and C–NH–C stretching (1406 cm–1) were also observed. Similar to CA-0, CJ-0 showed a C=O stretch
at 1734 cm–1, indicative of the presence of acid
groups, which disappeared when the sample was pyrolyzed. The peak
at 1638 cm–1, characteristic of the amide C=O
stretch, appeared starting at CJ-10. This peak became more prominent
as the sample was heated for a total time of 12 and 14 min (CJ-12
and CJ-14). Unlike CA, CJ is composed of various sugars, free and
bound phenolic acids, and organic acids found in the CJ juice matrix,
which provided the complexity in the spectra.

The 1H and 13C NMR shifts of the CDs prepared
from the pyrolysis of CA (CA-0 to CA-20) and CJ (CJ-0 to CJ-16) were
monitored for the functional groups present as the samples were pyrolyzed.
From 0 to 14 min, prominent 1H NMR peaks can be observed
at 2.6 and 2.75 ppm and at 3.38 ppm, which corresponded to methylene
peaks of CA and EDA, respectively (Figures 5, S6A, and Table S4). This illustrates that the chemical environment surrounding the
methylene protons for both CA and EDA did not significantly change.
Between 8 and 14 min (CA-8 to CA-14), very small amount of new peaks
was observed since very little condensation reaction has proceeded.
In addition, water has not completely evaporated from the sample after
these were subjected to pyrolysis (Figure 4A). However, these peaks at 2.6, 2.75, and
3.38 ppm disappear as CA dehydrolyzes during CA condensation with
other CA or EDA molecules (see CA-16, CA-18, and CA-20 in Figure 5A and Table S4). Several small peaks are observed between
2.5 and 4.2 ppm starting at CA-8. These peaks along 2.5–4.2
ppm become more prominent after the sample has been subjected to at
least 14 min pyrolysis (CA-14 to C-20) (Figure 5A).

Figure 5 NMR spectra of CA-CD time study in D2O. (A) 1H NMR spectra and (B) 13C NMR spectra
at the 30–80
ppm and 140–200 ppm regions. Each sample was obtained from
microwave pyrolysis of 100 mL of 0.1 g/mL CA in DI water and 3480
μL EDA at 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 min using 70% microwave
power (630 W) at 2 min repetitive heating. Stacked NMR graphs were
plotted for these samples: CA-0 (sample with no heating), CA-4, 8,
12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 (sample with the indicated total heating time
in min) (see Table S4).

13C NMR spectra also show the disappearance
of the peak
at 78 ppm, indicative of the absence of methine proton of CA (Figure 5B, CA-18). The small
peaks along 40–50 ppm may be due to the formation of a carbon
framework attached to electron withdrawing atoms like oxygen or nitrogen
(C–H, C–NR2, C–C=O, and −OCH3). However, the peaks along 150–185 ppm may be attributed
to the presence of oxygen groups attached to the aromatic rings; conjugated
alkenes attached to a carbonyl group, such as amide, ester, and acid
moieties (R–CONR2, R–COOR, and R–COOH);
or conjugated imine groups. IR also confirmed the disappearance of
acid C=O stretching at 1720 cm–1 and the
appearance of amide C=O stretching at 1640 cm–1 when the samples were pyrolyzed for at least 14 min (CA-14, Figure S1A). By CA-20, new set of peaks similar
to those of CA and EDA (CA-0 sample) appeared, but these are slightly
downshifted at 2.6–2.8, 2.8–2.9, and 3.4 ppm. One of
the methylene peaks, at 48 ppm, disappeared, indicating that CA
may have been converted to a different functional moiety. When EDA
was incorporated into the CA carbon network as the solution was heated
beyond 14 min total pyrolysis time, the presence of multiple amine
groups in EDA also allowed its facile incorporation on the surface
of the CDs. Both types of incorporation and the pyrolysis conditions
increase the chance of formation of emissive traps, arising from the
functional moieties and/or change in the hybridization of the carbon
core and conjugated π domains on the surface or at the core
of the CDs. Because higher photoluminescence intensities were obtained
from these samples (CA-14 to C-20), this may be due to the synergistic
effect of both the surface state and the carbogenic core, as reported
by Qu et al.34

1H NMR
spectrum of CJ with EDA before pyrolysis, CJ-0,
also provides peaks at 2.52–2.69 and 3.27 ppm, which correspond
to the α-methylene protons of CA in CJ and EDA, respectively
(Figure S6). 13C NMR peaks at
182 and 185 ppm correspond to the carbonyl groups, at 79 ppm corresponds
to the CA methine carbon, at 49 ppm is for the CA methylene carbon,
and at 40 ppm is for the EDA methylene carbon. Both 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra ascertain the presence of CA in
CJ in significant quantities. However, different from CA 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra, small peaks between 2.5 and
4.5 ppm in CJ-0 may be due to the functional moieties from the sugars
(fructose, glucose, and sucrose) present in the CJ matrix. These peaks
were also observed along the 38–80 ppm region of 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 6B and Table S4). Because other components
in CJ, such as the free and bound phenolic acids and other organic
acids, are present in smaller quantities, the peaks corresponding
to these compounds are not visible. Between 0 and 10 min heating,
only three peaks were predominant in 1H NMR spectrum (2.52–2.69
and 3.27 ppm). Additional small peaks were observed in 1H NMR spectrum of CJ-12, indicative of the presence of the methylene
or methine carbon attached to C=O or directly to electron-withdrawing
atoms like oxygen or nitrogen in the sample. In addition, the peaks
at 2.58–2.73 ppm in CJ-12 became broad, unlike in the CA-18 sample,
where these two peaks (corresponding to CA) disappeared as the sample
was pyrolyzed for a longer period of time. These peaks remained present
in CJ-14 and CJ-16, presumably due to the methylene peaks of unreacted
acid groups. However, this can also indicate the presence of methylene
protons attached to a carbon adjacent to an amide group arising from
condensation between CA and EDA. These new amide carbonyl peaks also
appeared upfield around 165–175 ppm, whereas the acid carbonyl
peaks were evident along 182 and 185 ppm in the 13C NMR
spectra of CJ-12, CJ-14, and CJ-16 (Figure 6B). Furthermore, additional peaks appeared
along the 40–50 and 70–80 regions in the 13C NMR spectra of CJ-12, CJ-14, and CJ-16; these peaks can be attributed
to the methyl, methylene, or methine groups attached to electron-withdrawing
atoms like oxygen or nitrogen and the methylene or methine groups
belonging to cyclic rings, which are attached to a carbonyl moiety
or an aromatic ring. The 13C NMR spectra of CJ-12, CJ-14,
and CJ-16 along the 150–185 ppm region are similar to those
of CA-18, wherein the peaks can be attributed to aromatic rings possessing
oxygen moieties, alkenes attached to a ring and/or conjugated to a
carbonyl carbon, and conjugated imine groups. Some of these groups
arise from the concomitant formation of ring-structured carbon from
CA in CJ with EDA or due to the reaction of existing functionalities
found in the CJ matrix with EDA, and these peaks can be observed along
the 5.5 ppm region and above of 1H NMR spectrum and >150
ppm region of 13C NMR spectrum.

Figure 6 NMR spectra of CJ-CD
time study in D2O. (A) 1H NMR spectra and (B) 13C NMR spectra at the 30–80
ppm and 140–200 ppm regions. Each sample was obtained from
microwave pyrolysis of 100 mL of CJ and 3480 μL of EDA at 4,
8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 min using 70% microwave power (630 W) at 2 min
repetitive heating. Stacked NMR graphs were plotted for these samples:
CJ-0 min (sample with no heating), CJ-4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 (sample
with the indicated total heating time in minutes) (see Table S4).

The CA (CA-0-CA-20) and CJ (CJ-0-CJ-16) time study samples
were
subjected to dynamic light scattering (DLS) and diffusion-ordered
NMR spectroscopy (DOSY). The CA samples did not provide any DLS signal
until CA-18, which has a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 0.76 nm. This
indicates that the CA CDs formed slowly with time and the CDs were
only observed after the sample was pyrolyzed for 18 min. Because most
of the CA samples did not give positive signals when subjected to
light scattering experiments, the size of the particles was also ascertained
using DOSY (Figure S7). The DOSY experiment
was performed in the CA-20 sample, which provided particle size ranging
from 0.1 to 0.65 nm. This supported the observation that no large
CDs were formed from the CA time study samples because the size range
is along that of small molecules. However, AFM results revealed that
CA-18 is mostly composed of spherical particles with height in the
range of 6–8 nm. It is possible that the particles aggregated
on the mica sheet when the samples were drop-casted and air-dried,
thereby providing bigger particle sizes compared to those in DLS results
(Figure 7A). ζ
Potential experiments also confirmed that CA-18 exhibited a ζ
potential of −5.68 mV. However, other CA samples showed near-zero
ζ potential, which confirmed the absence of CDs in the samples.
For CJ samples, the hydrodynamic radius increased from 1.07 nm (CJ-0)
to 9.25 nm (CJ-4). The size of the particles gradually decreased from
4.20 nm (CJ-8) to 2.84 nm (CJ-10), 1.15 nm (CJ-12), 1.54 nm (CJ-14),
and 0.88 nm (CJ-16) (Figure 7C). The observed results may be due to the aggregation of
pyrolyzed sugars, free and bound phenolic acids, and organic acids
found in the juice matrix, and then these big carbon particles break
up into smaller CD particles during further pyrolysis. Because CJ
is composed of a mixture of different compounds that can form and
aggregate differently compared with CA, the presence of nonuniformly
shaped particles is evident in the CJ-14 micrograph (Figure 7B). CJ-14 has big particles
with height in the range of 6–9 nm and a number of smaller
particles of 1–4 nm. The ζ of the CJ samples decreases
from −12.99 mV (CJ-0) to around −8 to 9 mV (−9.02
mV for CJ-14 and −8.32 mV for CJ-16), which indicated that
the functional moieties carrying negative charges are disrupted as
pyrolysis of the CJ samples progresses. In addition, because the ζ
values of the CDs are <10 mV, these particles have a higher chance
to form aggregates.

CDs obtained using DLS with the sample concentration of 2 mg/mL in
water. All samples were filtered through membrane filters with a pore
size of 450 nm prior to analysis. (D) XRD patterns of CA-4, CA-8,
CA-12, CA-16, CA-18, and CJ-14 CDs.

The XRD patterns of CA-4 to CA-12 revealed highly crystalline
samples
(Figure 7D). The presence
of a number of peaks may indicate a complex mixture of crystalline
components. When the samples were heated for 16 and 18 min total time
(CA-16 and CA-18), the XRD patterns displayed a broad peak along 25°,
which can be attributed to the presence of amorphous or highly disordered
carbon atoms.44 Conversely, the XRD pattern
revealed that CJ-14 is highly amorphous (Figure 7D). However, there are some crystalline peaks
present in the sample.

Toxicity Study of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs
Mung beans were
used to assess the toxicity of the CDs.45 Increasing CA-18 and CJ-14 CD concentrations ranging from 0.1 to
0.5, 1, 1.2, 2, 5, and 10 mg CD/mL DI water were used to grow mung
beans, with DI water as control. The growth of the beans was monitored
at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The results showed that the beans tolerated
up to 2 mg/mL CA-18 CDs. At 5 and 10 mg/mL concentration, no observable
growth took place (Figure S8). This may
be due to the toxicity attributed to the higher concentration of CDs
in the system. Although the beans sprouted within 24 h, the growth
did not occur after that. Mung beans grown using CJ-14 CD solutions
were observed to be more dose-dependent compared to CA-CDs. CJ-14
CDs inhibited the growth of the mung beans beyond 0.5 mg/mL (Figure S8). At CJ-14 CD concentrations of 2 mg/mL
and above, no observable growth took place, although the beans sprouted
within 24 h. Li et al.11 have shown that
using 0.1 g/mL is optimum for cultivating bean sprout using different
carbon nanomaterials, such as carbon quantum dots, graphene quantum
dots, graphene oxide, and single-walled carbon nanotubes. Similar
to what was observed in this study, the toxicity increased when the
concentrations of these four carbon nanomaterials were elevated and
at prolonged cultivation time.

After 96 h, one bean sprout per
concentration dish was taken and photographed under normal light and
UV light (365 nm). As shown in Figure S9A–D, bean sprouts grown in CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs at concentrations 0.5
mg/mL and above exhibited fluorescence along their stems. This suggests
that the CDs (Rh CA-18 = 0.76 nm and Rh CJ-14 = 1.54 nm) were transported
inside the cytoderm of the bean sprout. Sprouts grown in pure water
and 0.1 mg/mL CDs showed no fluorescence.

The length of the
sprouts for each bean was also measured after
144 h. The average length of nine sprouts per test concentration and
its corresponding standard deviation are summarized in Table S5. CA-18 CDs were shown to be less toxic
than CJ-14 CDs because the growth of the beans was promoted (Figure S9E). The beans grown using CA-18 CDs
at 1 mg/mL DI water were longer (average length = 16.4 ± 2.7
cm) compared with those grown using the control (13.4 ± 5.9 cm). However, Qu et
al.17 and Xu et al.43 showed that sprouts grown at 1.5 mg/mL CDs prepared using
CA-urea and calcium citrate–urea, respectively, were nontoxic
and did not hinder plant growth. CA-18 CDs were shown to be nontoxic
up to 2 mg/mL, whereas CJ-14 CDs inhibited growth at concentrations
0.5 mg/mL and above. From the results, it is clear that CJ-14 CDs
are more toxic than CA-18 CDs. The toxicity of CJ-14 may arise from
the material size, nonuniform particle shape, more negative surface
charge, and higher crystallinity compared to those of CA-18 and less
likely due to the material composition of the particle’s core.
Li et al.45 reported that CDs with positive
surface charge translocate from the roots to the stems and leaves
of the mung beans through the vascular system via the apoplastic pathway.
Although the surface charge dictates the differential internalization
and subcellular localization of the CDs, cells rarely use different
uptake routes for cationic or anionic particles.46,47 Functionalized carbon particles possessing carbonyl (C=O),
carboxyl (COOH), and/or hydroxyl (OH) groups on the surface are more toxic to cells (lung tumor) compared with their nonfunctionalized
counterparts.48 Charged particles such
as anionic particles (carboxyl functionalized) have been shown to
cause intracellular damage (induce apoptosis), whereas cationic particles
(amine functionalized) induce membrane damage.47

Conclusions
A straightforward and
inexpensive gram-scale preparation of CDs
from readily available sources was described. CA and Philippine citrus
calamansi juice (CJ) CDs were prepared using microwave pyrolysis of
1:1 molar ratio (0.1 g CA/mL DI water (100 mL)/3.48 mL EDA) or CJ
1:1 (100 mL CJ/3.48 mL EDA) using 70% (630 W) at 2 min repetitive
heating. The gram-scale pyrolysis for CA and EDA was carried out for
a total pyrolysis time of 18 min to provide CA-18 (Rh = 0.76 nm and
ζ = −5.68 mV) in 97% yield and for a total pyrolysis
time of 14 min for CJ and EDA to provide CJ-14 (Rh = 1.54 nm and ζ
= −9.02 mV) in 7% yield. Sample CJ-14 has a nonuniform particle
shape and broader size distribution compared to those of spherical
CA-18. XRD results also revealed the difference between CA-18 (amorphous)
and CJ-14 (amorphous and crystalline). The CDs were shown to be stable
at pHs 7.4 and 12, but the emission slightly red-shifted at pH 2 for
CA-18. CA-18 CDs promoted mung bean growth and were shown to be nontoxic
up to 2 mg/mL. However, CJ-14 CDs inhibited mung bean growth at concentrations
0.5 mg/mL and above. Herein, we demonstrated that although the surface
functional groups and the carbogenic cores of CA and CJ systems evolved
differently using microwave pyrolysis, the final carbon dots showed
very similar optical properties. The surface functionalities of the
carbon dots from the IR and NMR results do vary when comparing CA
and CJ systems, and this leads to very different toxicity. Taken together,
these results indicate that the pyrolysis conditions, the particle
size, and the surface groups are important in obtaining highly emissive
particles from a pure or mixture sample source.

Methods
Materials
The following reagents were used for this
study: citric acid monohydrate (CA; J.T. Baker, RG), calamansi juice
(CJ; obtained from various markets within Metro Manila), ethylenediamine
(Sigma-Aldrich, RG), triethylamine (Merck, RG), diethylamine (Unilab,
RG), quinine (Merck, RG), potassium bromide (HiMedia, RG), D2O (Cambridge isotope laboratories, Inc.), d6-dimethyl sulfoxide oxide (DMSO) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories,
Inc.), sodium hydroxide (RCL Labscan, RG), hydrochloric acid (Macron
Chemicals), potassium hydrogen phthalate (Merck, RG), and deionized
water (conductivity = 0.1 μS/cm). All chemicals were used without
further purification.

Gram-Scale Synthesis of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs
CA stock
solution was prepared with 1:1 molar ratio of CA/EDA (100 mL of 0.1
g/mL CA in DI water/3480 μL EDA). Two solutions (50 and 100
mL) were pyrolyzed using a microwave oven at 70% power (630 W) and
at 2 min repetitive heating until red-brown products were obtained.
Samples were transferred into vials and subjected to lyophilization
(Eyela FDU-2200) at −80 °C and 20 Pa for at least 24 h.
Dried samples were subjected to UV–vis (UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer
equipped with a W–I2 lamp using 0.7 mL quartz cuvettes)
and photoluminescence emission (Ocean Optics, USB 2000 spectrometer
and 355 nm UV Crystal PL 2003 Q Switch Laser equipped with an OOIBase32
software set at 50 ms integration time, five units average, five units
boxcar, and 1 ms strobe frequency) experiments using 1 × 10–5 g CD/mL DI water and 1.2 mg CD/mL DI water, respectively.
For gram-scale synthesis of aminated CA-CDs, six trials were carried
out to ensure repeatability. Subsequently, these samples were subjected
to freeze-drying and analyzed using a similar procedure as detailed
above. For gram-scale synthesis of CJ-CDs, six trial samples of 100 mL of freshly extracted juice
containing EDA from the stock solution (100 mL CJ/3480 μL EDA)
were heated in a microwave oven using 70% power (630 W) at 2 min repetitive
heating until red-brown products were obtained. Calamansi fruits were
obtained from different sources: trial 1, Rosario market, Pasig City;
trial 2, Del Monte market, Quezon City; trial 3, Pure Gold (Quezon
Avenue branch), Quezon City; trial 4, combined samples from Del Monte
and Pure Gold, Quezon City; trial 5, SM Savemore (Santolan branch),
Pasig City; trial 6, combination of juices from trials 1 to 5.

Quantum Yield
Measurements19
Quinine sulfate in
0.1 M H2SO (quantum yield, QY = 0.54) was chosen as a standard.
The QYs of the CDs (CA-18 and CJ-14, in 0.1 M H2SO) were
calculated using eq 1, where Φ is the QY, I is the measured integrated
emission intensity, and η is the refractive index of the solvent.
The subscript “st” refers to the standard with known
QY and “s” for the sample. To minimize reabsorption
effects, the absorption of the solutions in the fluorescence cuvette
was less than 0.10 at the excitation wavelength (355 nm). The integrated
photoluminescence intensities of quinine sulfate (st) or CDs (s) were
plotted against the corresponding absorbance values using several
solutions where the concentration was kept below 0.1 at excitation
wavelength. The absolute values were calculated using the slope of
the quinine sulfate (I = 25 243), CA-18 (I = 785.55), and CJ-14 (I = 939.86) from
the plots and the QY (Φ = 54%) of the quinine sulfate. For these
solutions, ηs/ηst = 1. 1  

Heating Time Study of the
Formation of CA- and CJ-CDs
The CA solution (100 mL of 0.1
g/mL CA in DI water/3480 μL
EDA) or 1:1 molar ratio of CJ with EDA (100 mL CJ/3480 μL EDA)
was subjected to gram-scale CD synthesis (see gram-scale synthesis).
The samples were heated in a microwave using 70% power (630 W) at
increments of 2 min for a total time of 0, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16, 18, and
20 min, whereas CJ samples were pyrolyzed at increments of 2 min for
a total of 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 min. The samples were subjected
to lyophilization to remove any traces of water, and the CDs were
characterized using UV–vis, photoluminescence emission, FT-IR
(Shimadzu IP Prestige/IRAffinity/FT-IR-8000 series using KBr pellet,
2% w/w), and NMR (JEOL-400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C NMR using D2O or d6-DMSO, 0.75 mL) spectroscopy. The product yields for the CA or CJ
CDs were calculated using the dried mass of CDs over the mass of CA
or CJ (juice) used (eq 2). 2  

Dispersibility of CA-18
and CJ-14 CDs
The dispersibilities
of CA CDs produced after total heating time of 18 min (CA-18) and
of CJ CDs produced after total heating time of 14 min (CJ-14) were
tested against different solvents: water (H2O), dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, methanol (MeOH),
ethanol (EtOH), tetrahydrofuran (THF), hexane, toluene, chloroform
(CHCl3), and methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) at room temperature. The CDs were dispersed in the test solvents
to obtain 1 mg/mL solutions.

pH Stability of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs
The pH stabilities
of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs from the gram-scale study were tested (pH 700;
Eutech Instruments). Solutions with 1.2 × 10–5 g CD/mL were prepared by dispersing CDs in DI water at pHs 2, 7.4,
and 12 (adjusted using HCl and NaOH). UV absorption of these samples
was monitored at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h upon dispersion. Two trial
samples were prepared for each sample. Solutions of 1.2 mg CD/mL DI
water dispersion were also prepared by mixing the CDs in DI water
at pHs 2, 7.4, and 12 (adjusted using HCl and NaOH). Photoluminescence
emission of the different suspensions was measured after dispersion.
Two trials were carried out for each sample.

Size, Surface Charge, and
State of CA and CJ Time Study Samples
The size of sample
was measured via dynamic light scattering (DLS)
and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY). DLS analysis was carried
out using an ALV/CGS-3 MD goniometer system, consisting of a 22 nW
He–Ne laser (emitting vertically polarized light with a wavelength
of 632.8 nm) and an avalanche photodiode detector located at an angle
of 90°. The samples were prepared by suspending the CD samples
in water (2 mg/mL), and the samples were filtered using a filter paper
with a pore size of 450 nm to remove the dust prior to analysis. The
data was obtained by taking the number-weighted size. DOSY tests were
carried out on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz spectrometer. The diffusion
coefficient (D) was determined, and this was utilized
to obtain the hydrodynamic radius by employing the Stokes–Einstein
equation (eq 3). 3  where D is the diffusion
coefficient measured from DOSY; k is the Boltzmann
constant; T is the temperature (300 K); η is
the viscosity of solvent (D2O); and R is
the hydrodynamic radius.

The surface charge of CDs was characterized
via ζ potential using ZetaPlus (Brookhaven Instruments) equipped
with a SR-516-type electrode. The CD samples were prepared by suspending
the CDs in 0.1 mM KCl to provide CD solutions with 2 mg/mL concentration.
All of the samples were filtered using filters with a pore size of
450 nm prior to analysis. Three runs were obtained and averaged for
each sample, and the ζ potential values were calculated using
Smoluchowski fits to the data.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging
The powdered
samples were dispersed in deionized water, drop-casted on freshly
cleaved mica surfaces, and air-dried. The samples were imaged via
noncontact mode using a Park Systems XE-70 Atomic Force Microscope.

X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD)
XRD patterns were recorded
using an Ultima IV X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan), with a Cu
Kα radiation source. The powdered samples were placed on a silicon
low-background sample holder and subjected to a θ–2θ
scan.

Toxicity Study of CA-18 and CJ-14 CDs
This study was
adopted from the work of Li et al.,11 Qu
et al.,17 and Xu et al.43 with the following modifications: CA-18 and CJ-14 CD solutions
with concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL were prepared.
For each sample, Petri dishes with 10 mung bean seeds were soaked
in 15 mL of CD solutions. A total of 45 mL of CD solution was added
to each corresponding dish (at 5, 10, 15, and 15 mL increments after
24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively). The samples were observed and
photographed at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. The length of the stem of
the mung bean was measured after 144 h. Sample size (n = 9) of the sprouts was measured with each plotted data as the average.
Beans that did not sprout were labeled as 0 cm.
