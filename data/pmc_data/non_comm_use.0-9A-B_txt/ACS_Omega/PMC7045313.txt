One of the serious problems in
the oil industry is precipitation
and deposition of asphaltenes in the different oil production stages
including formation, wellbore, production tubing, flow lines, and
separation units. This phenomenon causes a dramatic increase in the
cost of oil production, processing, and transferring. Thus, it seems
to be very necessary to use the removing methods for precipitated
asphaltenes in different crude oil production and transferring stages.
In this study, the ability of microorganisms for biodegradation of
precipitated asphaltenes was investigated. For this purpose, four
bacterial consortiums were isolated from oil-contaminated soil, crude
oil, reservoir water, and oil sludge samples of an oil field located
in the southwest of Iran. Based on the results of the designed experiments,
by using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite
design, the bacterial consortiums were cultured in the flasks. Three
levels of temperatures, salinity, pH, and initial asphaltene concentration
as the substrate were considered as the parameters of culture medium
and incubated growth mediums for 60 days. The maximum asphaltene biodegradation
was 46.41% caused by the crude oil consortium including Staphylococcus saprophyticus sp. and Bacillus cereus sp. at 45 °C, salinity 160 g·L–1, pH 6.5, and 25 g·L–1 initial
asphaltene concentration. Also, it was observed that the negative
or positive impacts of culture media conditions such as temperature
and salinity on asphaltene degradation depended on the type of the
available bacterial consortium. The carbon–hydrogen–nitrogen–sulfur
analysis showed that carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and in some cases,
the sulfur in biodegraded samples are less than in control samples.
Moreover, Fourier transform infrared analysis indicated that the alkyne
groups were less resistant to biodegradation and were eliminated thoroughly
after 2 months of incubation. In addition, alkane components were
partially removed in treated asphaltene fraction. The parameters of
culture medium were optimized by RSM, and besides, their effects on
the performance of bacteria in the asphaltene biodegradation process
were discussed. The validity of some available kinetic models to describe
the behavior of the studied bacteria consortium was investigated,
and it was observed that Tessier, Moser, and Contois models accurately
predict the values of asphaltenes and biomass concentration at 30,
45, and 60 °C, respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Asphaltenes are considered as a fraction of crude oil that is insoluble
in normal alkanes, e.g., pentane, heptane, and decane, but can be
dissolved in aromatic solvents, e.g., toluene, benzene, and xylenes,
at room temperature.1−5 X-ray diffraction analysis demonstrated the asphaltene structure
as flat plates of aromatics systems that are interconnected by sulfur,
ether, aliphatic chains, and/or naphthenic rings.6,7

Asphaltene precipitation from reservoir fluids in all stages of
oil production and transportation causes a serious problem and increases
the cost of production.8−12 Because of these problems, it seems to be mandatory to find and
employ asphaltene precipitation removal methods such as chemical methods,
physical techniques, thermal methods, and microbial methods.13−16 Recently, biological processes as one of the affordable and environment-friendly
methods have encouraged researchers to use them in removing precipitated
asphaltenes. Hydrocarbon biodegradation is a very important mechanism
that causes the elimination of crude oil and other pollutant hydrocarbons
from ecosphere.17

The limitations
of microorganisms’ culture medium are one
of the significant controlling factors in the biodegradation of oil
pollution in the environment.18,19 The hydrophobic nature
of the hydrocarbon components of the petroleum makes them connect
with soil components and causes reducing the oil components elimination
or degradation. The microorganisms’ effects on hydrocarbons
and the possibility of hydrocarbons biodegradation are different.
Resistance downtrend of hydrocarbons in the biodegradation process
between linear alkanes and asphaltenes is as follows:

Asphaltenes
> resin > polycyclic aromatics > cyclic alkanes > small
aromatics > branched alkanes > linear alkanes.

The alteration
of the crude oil structure due to biodegradation
processes and the effect of microorganisms on its chemical and physical
properties have been studied significantly.20−24 In comparison, there is not enough studies on the
asphaltene biodegradation and the alteration of asphaltene structure
in the biodegradation process. Pineda et al. inoculated microbial
consortium including Corynebacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Brevibacillus sp., and Staphylococcus sp. to the medium containing mineral salts and asphaltene precipitation.
The asphaltene precipitation as the sole source of energy and carbon
was added to the mineral medium and asphaltenes biodegradability evaluated
using the ISO 9439 method after 13 days of incubation.25 On the other hand, it was confirmed that just
a part of asphaltenes and bitumen is affected by enzymes and microbial
activity.10 Also, it was proven that asphaltene
bio catalytic reformation can be occurred by some hemeproteins such
as chloroperoxidase, cytochrome C peroxidase, and lignin peroxidase
from Caldariomyces fumago, Bacillus megaterium, and Escherichia
coli and remove the nickel and vanadium from petro
porphyrins and asphaltenes.10,26,27 Moreover, the possibility of isolating some species from the Dorood
oil field and Bangestan reservoir in Iran which can utilize asphaltene
precipitation as the sole source of carbon and energy at 28 and 40
°C under shaking and static conditions was studied.28,29 Aditiawati and Kamarisima30 evaluated
the performance of four isolated bacteria from a sludge oil sample
from Balikpapan on precipitated asphaltene. Bacillus sp. and Lysinibacillus fusiformis have the best ability to degrade asphaltene, and percentage of their
asphaltene biodegradation was 50 and 55%, respectively.30 Moreover, Asadollahi et al.,31 identified Bacillus cereus as a bio surfactant-producing bacterium in the oil-contaminated
soil and oily sludge samples around the Kermanshah Oil Refining Company
which could degrade 40% of asphaltenes after 60 days at 28 °C.31 Iraji and Ayatollahi32 studied on the effect of a surfactant on the microorganism adhesion
and cell surface hydrophobicity of Enterobacter cloacae, E. cloacae, and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and evaluated the performance of these
bacteria in the asphaltene biodegradation at 40 °C. They observed
that cell hydrophobicity alteration leads to more asphaltene biodegradability
up to 49%.32

The asphaltene precipitation
phenomenon in oil equipment is a serious
challenge in the production facilities in the Iranian southwest oilfields,33,34 and in the previous work, it has been shown that some isolated bacteria
from the Bangestan reservoir located in the one of the Iranian southwest
oilfields could degrade asphaltene precipitation and use it as a sole
source of carbon and energy.10

The
main goal of this study was an investigation on the precipitated
asphaltene biodegradation process by isolated bacterial consortia,
from oil contaminated soil, crude oil, reservoir water, and oil sludge
samples in the Bangestan reservoir of an Iranian southwest oil field.
Furthermore, the effects of cultural medium factors including temperature,
salinity, pH, and substrate concentration on the performance of identified
microorganisms were evaluated. The values of these parameters have
been attempted to be close to operating conditions.

The bacterial
consortium’s performance in asphaltenes biodegradation
process at 30, 45, and 60 °C with salinity 0, 80, and 160 g·L–1; pH 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5; and initial asphaltenes concentration
as substrate 15, 25, and 35 g·L–1 for two months
was assessed. In addition, the culture conditions of each available
bacterial consortium were optimized through the response surface methodology
(RSM). The alteration of asphaltene molecules during biodegradation
was investigated using spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Besides,
the validation of some available kinetic models to predict the concentration
of asphaltenes and microorganisms’ dry weight at pH 6.5, salinity
80 g·L–1, initial asphaltene concentration
25 g·L–1, and temperature 30, 45, and 60 °C
have been studied.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Identification of Microorganisms
Based on the results
of 16S rRNA sequence analysis and morphological
and biochemical tests which are listed in Table 2, isolated species from oil-contained samples
were identified. The isolated species from the same oil polluted environment
was categorized in a consortium. The Soil consortium which was obtained
from a polluted soil sample in the burning pit includes Bacillus cereus YSH-1 and Microbacterium
paraoxydans YSH-2. Three strains including E. cloacae YSH-3, Bacillus cereus YSH-4, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia YSH-5 were extracted from the reservoir water sample and placed
in Reservoir water consortium. Staphylococcus saprophyticus YSH-6 and Bacillus cereus YSH-7 strains
as isolated strains from the crude oil sample were categorized as
the Crude oil consortium. Moreover, Sludge consortium includes E. cloacae YSH-8, and Bacillus cereus YSH-9 strains were identified in the oil sludge sample.10

It was reported that benzene and other
polyaromatic hydrocarbons can be degraded by Bacillus sp. and also, branched alkanes, phenol, naphthalene, acetone, and
resin were degraded by Pseudomonas sp.35,36

Therefore, there is the probability of bacterial isolation
from
oil-contaminated samples that can degrade asphaltenes and as can be
observed in some conditions of culture mediums, in the comparison
of pure bacteria culture, the consortium of them can provide the maximum
asphaltene biodegradation.25,28,29

2.2 Asphaltene Biodegradation Results
The effect
of four bacterial consortiums and one mixed culture of
all available strains on the asphaltene degradation in the different
culture mediums was evaluated. The experimental results of asphaltenes
degradation percent (% w/w) and biomass dry weight after two months
of incubation are presented in Tables 1–3. The uncertainty in the samples’ weight was ±0.0001
g. It can be seen that in the different growth medium, a specific
bacterial consortium had various performances and in similar conditions,
the ability of consortiums to degrade asphaltenes was dissimilar.
After 60 days, the highest asphaltene biodegradation by the Crude
oil consortium was 46.71% at 45 °C, 160 g·L–1 salinity, pH equal to 6.5 and 25 g·L–1 as
initial asphaltene concentration. In addition, 39.72, 18.90, 40.35,
and 26.03% were the maximum asphaltene biodegradation using sludge,
soil, reservoir water, and all-isolated strain consortiums, respectively.
Also, it was determined that biodegradation ability of a specific
bacterial consortium can be higher or lower than the all-strain consortium.
Soil and Crude oil consortiums had the maximum and minimum performances
at the lowest temperature, salinity, pH and asphaltene concentration,
respectively. Furthermore, at the maximum temperature, salinity, pH
and asphaltene concentration, the best and worst efficiencies were
observed for Sludge and Soil consortiums, respectively.

In a previous work, it was observed
that Bacillus
cereus YSH-9 which was isolated from oil sludge had
maximum efficiency in the biodegradation of asphaltene precipitation.
Maximum biodegradation was achieved using YSH-1, YSH-2, YSH-4, YSH-5,
YSH-6, and YSH-8 strains as 41.5, 38.1, 41.51, 30.64, 30.65, and 33.33%,
respectively.10 A comparison between the
performance of pure isolates and consortia showed that microorganisms
in this consortium did not have synergy activity in all growth mediums
and in some cases, biodegradation potential of the bacterial consortium
can be higher than pure bacteria.

It was reported that compared
with pure bacteria, a mixed culture
of Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus licheniformis sp., Bacillus
lentus sp., Bacillus cereus sp., and Bacillus firmus sp. had
the highest reported degradation result, 48%, and obtained at 28 °C.28 In addition, the best consortiums’ performance
was achieved by an isolated bacterial consortium from a soil sample
from the Shiraz refinery including P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens at 40
°C and 35 g·L–1 of asphaltenes concentration
under shaking and static conditions. The highest observed precipitated
asphaltene degradation was 51.5 and 32% under shaking and static conditions,
respectively.29

The contribution
of the assimilation or dissimilation metabolisms
in asphaltene biodegradation would be evaluated by measuring the biomass
dry weight. In other words, the values of biomass dry weight explained
which one of them is more sensible. In assimilation, carbon was absorbed
and causes an increase in microorganisms’ dry weight by increasing
the substrate utilization. In the dissimilation metabolism, carbon
may be released as CO2 and lead to lack of microorganisms’
dry weight with increases in substrate consumption.10 For example, investigation on asphaltene biodegradation
and biomass dry weight results of Soil consortium performance in three
different growth mediums (run number 1, 20, and 25) shows that despite
the rise in asphaltene consumption in growth medium 25 compared with
20, the biomass dry weight decreases. It seems that in medium 25,
dissimilation metabolism is more effective than medium 20. On the
other hand, such as asphaltene biodegradation percent, the amount
of dry weight of biomass in medium 1 is higher than medium 20. It
can be concluded that in medium 1, assimilation metabolism is more
operative and compared with medium 20, and more carbon is absorbed
by bacterial members of the Soil consortium.

2.3 Influence
of Independent Variables on the
Asphaltene Biodegradation
The effect of temperature, salinity,
pH, and asphaltene concentration on the asphaltene biodegradation
as independent variables can be illustrated by perturbed figures.
These figures are derived from RSM and include some curves that each
presents the influence of one of the factors (in this study: growth
medium condition) on the response (in this study: precipitated asphaltene
biodegradation) qualitatively and can be observed in Figures 1–5.

Figure 1 Effect of culture medium variables [(A) temperature, (B) salinity,
(C) pH, and (D) initial asphaltene concentration] on asphaltene biodegradation
with the Soil consortium.

Figure 2 Effect
of culture medium variables [(A) temperature, (B) salinity,
(C) pH, and (D) initial asphaltene concentration] on asphaltene biodegradation
with the Reservoir water consortium.

Figure 3 Effect
of culture medium variables [(A) temperature, (B) salinity,
(C) pH, and (D) initial asphaltene concentration] on asphaltene biodegradation
with the Crude oil consortium.

Figure 4 Effect
of culture medium variables [(A) temperature, (B) salinity,
(C) pH, and (D) initial asphaltene concentration] on asphaltene biodegradation
with the Sludge consortium.

Figure 5 Effect
of culture medium variables on [(A) temperature, (B) salinity,
(C) pH, and (D) initial asphaltene concentration] asphaltene biodegradation
with the All-strain consortium.

The negative and positive slopes of curves point to that the factors
have negative and positive effects on consortium performance, respectively.
The zero slope means that increasing or decreasing the values of these
parameters does not affect the bacterial consortium activity. As can
be observed the influence of temperature, salinity, pH, and substrate
concentration on asphaltene degradation depended on the type of the
available bacterial consortium. For instance, before the intermediate
(center coded) quantities, pH and initial asphaltene concentration
had a positive and after that had a negative effect on Crude oil consortium
performance. Moreover, in comparison with pH and initial asphaltene
concentration, salinity had a reverse effect and temperature did not
significantly effect on the biodegradation process by this mixed culture.
As can be observed in each perturbed figure, the effect of two independent
variables on asphaltene biodegradation are more significant. For example,
salinity and pH influences on the Crude oil consortium performance
and temperature and initial asphaltene concentration effect on Sludge
consortium activity are more remarkable. The concurrent effect of
two variables which had the most significant influence on bacteria
consortium performance have been illustrated by 3D surface images
in Figures 6–10. In these figures, the influences of temperature and pH for
the Soil consortium, temperature and salinity for the Reservoir water
consortium, salinity and pH for the Crude oil consortium, temperature
and initial asphaltene concentration for the Sludge consortium, and
pH and initial asphaltene concentration for the all-strain consortium
have been studied, respectively. Two other factors for each bacterial
consortium have been kept constant in their mid-range.

asphaltene biodegradation percentage using
the Soil consortium on pH and temperature in a salinity of 80 g·L–1 and an initial asphaltene concentration of 25 g·L–1.

Figure 7 Response surface of the
asphaltene biodegradation percentage using
the Reservoir water consortium on salinity and temperature in pH =
6.5 and an initial asphaltene concentration of 25 g·L–1.

Figure 8 Response surface of the asphaltene biodegradation
percentage using
the Crude oil consortium on pH and salinity at a temperature of 45
°C and an initial asphaltene concentration of 25 g·L–1.

Figure 9 Response surface of the
asphaltene biodegradation percentage using
the Sludge consortium on initial asphaltene concentration and temperature
in a salinity of 80 g·L–1 and pH = 6.5.

Figure 10 Response surface of asphaltene biodegradation percentage
using
the All-strain consortium on initial asphaltene
concentration and pH at 45 °C and a salinity of 80 g·L–1.

Figure 6 shows that
in a salinity of 80 g·L–1 and asphaltene concentration
of 25 g·L–1 when increasing the temperature
and pH simultaneously, asphaltene degradation by the Soil consortium
was initially reduced and then increased. Also, at the highest pH
value, increase in the temperature had a positive influence on the
Soil consortium activity and more precipitated asphaltene degraded.
At the maximum temperature, pH growth before 6.5 led to degradation
decrease and after that increase. In addition, asphaltene biodegradation
was more sensitive to pH and the effect of the pH alteration on it
is more remarkable. Also, maximum biodegradation was obtained in the
lowest and highest pH and temperature, respectively.

The concurrent
effects of salinity and temperature on asphaltene
biodegradation using the Reservoir water consortium in pH 6.5 and
an initial asphaltene concentration of 25 g·L–1 have been demonstrated in Figure 7. It can be observed that the growth values of salinity
and temperature before intermediate values caused in the performance
of the Reservoir water consortium drop and then increase. It is notable
that biodegradation in the lowest values of salinity and temperature
rather their maximum values occurs more.

The 3D surface figure
of the asphaltene biodegradation percent
using the Crude oil consortium (Figure 8) demonstrates that at 45 °C and an initial substrate
concentration of 25 g·L–1, simultaneous increase
in salinity and pH before their mid-range led to degradation reduce
and after that increase. Furthermore, maximum biodegradation occurred
in the highest value of salinity and the mean value of pH.

Figure 9 shows that
in salinity 80 g·L–1 and pH 6.5, at the same
time, the increase in the initial asphaltene concentration and temperature
before and after mean values caused to decrease and increase asphaltene
biodegradation by the Sludge consortium, respectively. Also, it is
detected that maximum biodegradation has been obtained at maximum
temperature and mid-range of asphaltene concentration.

In Figure 10, it
is revealed that at 45 °C and a salinity of 80 g·L–1, simultaneous increase in asphaltene concentration and pH led to
improve the All-strain consortium performance. However, the graph
illustrates that the rate of asphaltene biodegradation growth in the
higher values of asphaltene concentration and pH was lower than the
smaller amounts of their value.

Environmental factors such as
temperature, pH, salinity, and so
forth, as extrinsic factors can directly affect bacterial growth and
metabolism. These factors can disturb membrane fluidity of the bacterial
cell and with regard to this fact that many physiological processes
in bacterial cell are dependent on membrane integrity, and the disturbing
agent that can affect membrane fluidity will reduce bacterial metabolism
performance and lead to a reduction in substrate consumption and bacterial
growth. Asphaltene concentration cannot be a limiting factor except
in very high concentrations that disturbs the carbon to nitrogen ratio
and leads to the reduction of bacterial growth and multiplication.

In a previous study, it was determined that at 40 °C, salinity
and pH affect asphaltene biodegradation more significantly than asphaltene
concentration and also increasing in the salinity had an unfavorable
effect on bacteria consortium’s performance including Pseudomonas, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus lentus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus firmus in asphaltene biodegradation.28

2.4 Elemental Analysis
The results of
asphaltene elemental analyses of untrained and trained asphaltene
precipitation have been listed in Table 4.

All-strain consortium	79.20	1.90	1.54	3.49	41.68	0.0194	0.0440	
It can be observed that following
biodegradation, carbon, hydrogen,
and nitrogen contents of asphaltenes precipitation were decreased.
Also, only the Crude oil consortium and All-strain consortium were
able to decline the weight fraction of sulfur in asphaltene molecules.
Increasing in the C/H mass ratio in asphaltene samples after the biodegradation
pointed to the fact that consortiums have broken asphaltene molecules,
consumed the elemental carbon and released hydrogen.

It was
revealed that some heterocyclic aromatic organic nitrogen
components such as pyrrolic and pyridinic are relatively resistant
to biodegradation while less resistive compounds are degraded, the
nitrogen to the carbon ratio in asphaltene molecules will increase.37

2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared
Analysis
In Figures 11 and 12, the results of Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR)
analysis on (1) control and (2) biodegraded asphaltenes precipitation
after two months’ incubation by the Reservoir water and All-strains
consortium have been illustrated. The peaks at 3429.58, 2921, and
1611 cm–1 in the control sample correspond to stretch
for sp C–H in alkyne groups, aldehyde, and alkene groups, respectively.38,39 It was detected that the alkyne groups had the least resistance
to biodegradation in the asphaltene structure and were disappeared
during the biodegradation process by each consortium. It was observed
that after 2 month incubation, the aldehyde group has not been degraded
significantly and as compared to alkyne and alkene compounds, it was
more resistant to biodegradation. Furthermore, some relative peaks
at almost 1350–1450 cm–1 belonged to bend
−CH3 in alkane components which were partially eliminated
in treated asphaltenes.10,38 It was identified that
in slight or moderate stages of biodegradation, the components such
as n-fatty acids and linear aliphatic alcohol which
bonded to the asphaltene core by ester and hydrogen bonds were affected.
On the other hand, because of the strong covalent bonds such as C–C
and ether bonds, the linear alkyl group which was attached by them
was degraded at heavy—severe stages.10,40 FT-IR analysis of other samples gave similar results.

25 g·L–1 using the Reservoir water consortium.

2.6 Optimization of Asphaltene
Biodegradation
To optimize the variables of the asphaltene
biodegradation process,
independent factors including temperature (Tem), salinity (Sal), pH
(pH), and initial asphaltenes concentration (Asp) have been applied
as input data in quadric models as below 1  where Y, α0, and αi (i =
1–14) are biodegraded asphaltenes, intercept and coefficients
of the model, respectively, and have been listed in Table 5. The high value of R2 as the coefficient of determination pointed
to the adequate fit of this equation for each system over the given
experimental domain. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the selected
model has been presented in Table 6. It can be seen that the proposed quadric model has
been significant for each sample. For example, the model F-value of 11485.87 and values of “Prob > F” less than 0.0001 for the Soil consortium indicates that
the model is significant. The optimum value of factors predicted the
percentage of biodegradation and desirability and is given in Table 7.

2.7 Kinetic Studies on Asphaltene
Biodegradation
The ability of Monod, Contois, and Tessier
models as kinetic models
to predict the concentration of substrate and biomass dry weight of
the Crude oil consortium has been evaluated. The asphaltene concentration
and microorganism dry weight were measured every five days during
60 days of incubation. In general, the mass balance equations for
asphaltenes and biomass are as follows 2   3  where x, μ, S, Yx/S,
and t are the biomass concentration in liquid medium
(g·L–1), the specific growth rate (day–1), the substrate
concentrations in the liquid medium (g·L–1),
the Biomass yield on asphaltenes (g/g) and time, respectively.29,41

The various equations have been proposed for the specific
growth rate as a key role in kinetic models. Some of them are as follows 4   5   6  where μm and KS are the maximum specific
growth rate (day–1) and kinetic constant (g·L–1), respectively.
The kinetic parameters and root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of these
models have been listed in Table 8.

Models for the Crude Oil Consortium in Asphaltenes Degradation at

 	60	42.101	5123.776	0.416	0.959	
It was found that temperature
has a significant effect on model
precision, and at each temperature, the Contois model could predict
the concentration of asphaltenes and microorganisms’ dry weight
as a function of time with the lowest rmsd. But as can be seen in Figures 13–15 for 45 °C, in comparison
with other models, the Contois model cannot show the lag, exponential,
and stationary phase of microorganisms consistent with alteration
concentration of asphaltenes by time correctly. Therefore, based on
the results of rmsd and curve fitting diagrams, the Monod model is
the best kinetics model to predict the behavior of systems at 30 °C
and at 45 and 60 °C of both the Monod and Tessier models have
almost the same precision.

Figure 13 Correlation results of the Tessier model with
experimental asphaltene
biodegradation data using Crude oil consortium at 45 °C, pH =
6.5, salinity = 80 g·L–1 and initial asphaltene
concentration = 25 g·L–1.

Figure 14 Correlation
results of the Monod model with experimental asphaltene
biodegradation data using the Crude oil consortium at 45 °C,
pH = 6.5, salinity = 80 g·L–1, and initial
asphaltenes concentration = 25 g·L–1.

Figure 15 Correlation results of the Contois model with experimental
asphaltene
biodegradation data using the Crude oil consortium at 45 °C,
pH = 6.5, salinity = 80 g·L–1, and initial
asphaltene concentration = 25 g·L–1.

It was revealed that in some growth medium conditions,
the Tessier
model was the best model, and unlike some other models such as Monod,
Moser, and logistic models, it had the highest R2 for the description of asphaltene biodegradation using bacterial
consortiums and Bacillus lentus.28,29

3 Conclusions
The performances of four
bacterial consortiums which identified
in the oil-contaminated soil, crude oil, reservoir water, and oil
sludge on precipitated asphaltene biodegradation at three levels of
temperatures, pH, salinity, and initial substrate concentrations during
two months’ incubation were studied. The results showed that
after the incubation period, the Crude oil consortium degraded the
highest amount of asphaltene precipitation, 46.71%, at 45 °C,
160 g·L–1 salinity, 6.50 pH, and 25 g·L–1 initial asphaltene concentration. The share of assimilation
and dissimilation metabolism was not same in all culture mediums and
a more powerful effect of assimilation makes increase in the biomass
dry weight concurrent with increasing the substrate utilization. The
elemental analysis presented that the bacterial consortium broke asphaltene
molecules into smaller segments and consumed the carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, and in some cases, sulfur. The spectroscopy results indicated
that alkyne groups and aldehyde groups in asphaltenes have the least
and most resistances to biodegradation, respectively. Using the RSM,
the statistical optimization was done and the optimum values of culture
media parameters were obtained. The results of the kinetic study showed
that at different temperatures, Tessier, Moser, and Contois models
have the different precision to predict the concentration of precipitated
asphaltene and microorganisms’ dry weight of the Crude oil
consortium as a function of time and Monod and Tessier models could
better correlate the experimental data.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Culture Medium Preparation
The content
of broth culture medium was mineral salts as the nutrient, precipitated
asphaltenes as the substrate and inoculated bacterial consortium.
The composition of mineral salts medium used in this study was similar
to the previous work, and asphaltene was extracted by the ASTM D3279-90
standard procedure.42 The members of consortiums
were isolated from oil-contaminated soil in the burning pit, reservoir
water, crude oil, and oil sludge samples from an Iranian southwest
oil field and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, and some biochemical
tests were carried out to identify them.10,43,44 The utilized general bacterial primer sets
were (5′CCGAATTCGTCGACAACAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) as
a forward primer and (5′-CCCGGGATCCAAGCTTAAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC-3′)
as a reverse primer.20 The polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed on a thermal cycler by using 25 μL
reaction mixture. The reaction mixture contains 1, 12.5, 9.5, and
1 μL of each forward and reverse primers, master mix 2×,
Milli-Q water and genome, respectively.16 The reaction mix was exposed to the denaturation process at 94 °C
for 5 min; next, the amplification was performed with 25 cycles of
1 min at 94 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C chased
by 1 cycle extension of 10 min at 72 °C.20 The analysis of PCR products was carried out by using 1% agarose
gel. As mentioned, the precipitated asphaltene was added to culture
medium as sole substrate. Therefore, the isolated strains were able
to utilize asphaltene precipitation as a sole source of carbon and
energy.

4.2 Asphaltene Biodegradation and Biomass Quantification
The experiments of asphaltene biodegradation were carried out in
the flasks, containing 5 mL of inoculum, 50 mL of the broth growth
medium in three pH levels 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5, and three levels of salinity
0, 80, and 160 g·L–1, with considering three
initial concentrations of asphaltenes, 15, 25, and 35 g·L–1. The flasks were incubated at 30, 45, and 60 °C
for two months. A pure colony of each bacterium on the latest solid
culture was removed, added to 10 mL of Muller-Hinton broth, were incubated
at 30 °C for 24 h and utilized as pure inoculum.10 Then, based on the oil-contaminated source of the bacterial
consortiums, 2 mL of pure members of each consortium was inoculated
to same fresh Muller–Hinton broth, and the culture mediums
were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Sampling and analysis were
performed at 5 days’ intervals during the experiments. Two
samples were provided for each test, and the average result of two
experiments was reported.10 To separate
the trained asphaltene and quantify the percentage of biodegradation,
the IP 143 method was applied.10,45 The free asphaltene
medium was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min, the sediment was dried
at 70 °C, and the constant weight was measured and reports as
the dry weight of the biomass.28,29

4.3 Analytical
Procedures
FT-IR spectroscopy
(Spectrum GX model, US) was performed to determine the alteration
of the asphaltene chemical structure through the biodegradation procedure.
For this purpose, the samples were run as KBr pellets (Merck, Germany).
The spectra were normally acquired at 4 cm–1 resolutions
over the range of 400–4000 cm–1. Also, carbon–hydrogen–nitrogen–sulfur
(CHNS) analysis was performed using the CHNSO analyser (ECS 4010 model,
Italy) to evaluate the ability of bacterial consortiums in removing
these elements from asphaltene precipitation at 45 °C, 80 g·L–1 salinity, pH equal to 6.5, and 25 g·L–1 of initial asphaltene concentration.

4.4 Asphaltene
Biodegradation Optimization
Design of experiments and process
variables optimization were done
using RSM and central composition design by software design expert
7 (DX7). The process variables including temperature, salinity, pH,
and initial asphaltene concentration were identified, and three levels
were considered for each of them. For statistical evaluation, the
lowest, middle, and highest of available independent factors were
coded as −1, 0 and +1, respectively.46,47 Based on the number of desired levels and factors, 30 experiments,
including six replicates at the center point to find the experimental
error, were designed to determine the effect of various parameters
on the precipitated asphaltene biodegradation process.

A quadratic
polynomial empirical model was employed to predict the response as
below 7  where, Y, k, β0, βi, b, βii, βij, and ε
represent response (asphaltenes biodegradation
percent), number of variables, intercept, coefficients of the linear
parameters, variables, coefficients of the quadratic parameters, coefficients
of the interaction parameters and residual associated to the experiments,
respectively.

4.5 Kinetic Studies
The kinetic study
provides a theoretical framework for optimal design in biotechnologies
based on the employment of outdoor activity of natural microbial populations
in various aspects such as fermentation, enzyme catalysis, wastewater
treatment, and soil bioremediation.41 In
this study, the ability of some kinetic models such as Monod, Contois,
and Tessier models to determine the kinetic coefficients of the Crude
oil consortium at three temperatures 30, 45, and 60 °C, with
a salinity of 80 g·L–1, pH equal to 6.5, and
an initial asphaltene concentration of 25 g·L–1 was evaluated. The cell growth and asphaltene concentration was
measured every 5 days for 60 days of the incubation period, and then,
the experimental data were used as the input of these models.
