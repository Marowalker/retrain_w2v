Reducing
the spatial inhomogeneity of solution-processed, multicrystalline
methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite is of great
importance for improving its power conversion efficiency, suppressing
point-to-point deviations, and delaying degradation during operation.
Various techniques, such as conducting-mode atomic force microscopy
and photoluminescence mapping, have been applied for this intriguing
class of materials, revealing nonuniform electronic properties on
the nanometer-to-micrometer scale. Here, we designed a new space-
and time-resolved microwave conductivity system that enables mapping
of the transient photoconductivity with resolution greater than ∼45
μm. We examined the effects of the precursor concentration of
MAPbI3 and the mixing of halides (I– and
Br–) on the charge carrier dynamics, crystal size,
and inhomogeneity of the films. The optoelectronic inhomogeneity of
MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 on the sub-millimeter
and millimeter scales shows a general correlation with their crystallite
sizes, whereas the precursor concentration and halide mixing affect
the inhomogeneity in a different way, providing a basis for uniform
processing of a multicrystalline perovskite film.

Introduction
Methylammonium lead
halide perovskite, MAPbI3 (MA =
CH3NH3+),1−3 has emerged
as a viable candidate for the construction of efficient, cost-effective
solar cells.4−9 The rapid boost of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the
solar cell, which reaches 22.1% within a short period of time,10 is owing to the excellent intrinsic photophysical
properties of MAPbI3, which include direct transition with
optimal band gaps,11 small exciton binding
energy,12,13 large diffusion length14,15 large charge carrier mobility,16−18 and small loss in open-circuit
voltage (Voc).19,20 The improvement in the PCE and the stability of the solar cell have
been achieved by the development of new solution-processing methods
that have evolved from one-step and two-step techniques21,22 to modified one-step approaches with antisolvent treatment.23−26 A high-quality perovskite film is composed of densely packed multicrystallites
with size of hundreds of nanometers. Although the film looks uniform,
its optical and electronic properties are inhomogeneous because of
nonuniform solvent evaporation during spin coating,27 phase separation, particularly for mixed-halide perovskites,28−30 and fluctuation of crystal growth under thermal annealing.31,32 The distorted stoichiometry of Pb and the halide produces vacancies
and carrier traps33−35 that cannot be discriminated using only conventional
microscopes, e.g., scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope,
and optical microscope.

Therefore, photo(electro)luminescence
mapping,36−39 spatially resolved transient
photoabsorption spectroscopy (TAS),40−42 and conducting-mode
atomic force microscopy (cAFM) including a Kelvin probe microscope43−45 are powerful tools to visualize the spatial inhomogeneity of trapping
sites and the charge-transport efficiency. For example, Wen et al.
reported a large spatial variation in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime
imaging by using one-photon (surface) and two-photon (bulk) excitation.36 Yamashita et al. found a negative correlation
between spatially resolved photocurrent and PL intensity, showing
the crucial role of the carrier injection rate on carrier recombination
and transport.39 Other reports on PL mapping
have shown the existence of a nonuniform carrier-transport efficiency
on tens to hundreds of micrometers, which is associated with a trap
density.37,38 A cAFM study revealed substantial variations
in the photoresponse that are correlated with thin-film microstructural
features of nanometer size, such as intragrain and planar defects
and grain boundaries.44 Overall, these
studies highlight the need for in-depth understanding of the spatial
inhomogeneity of perovskite to develop efficient solar cells with
small batch-to-batch and point-to-point variations.

In this
study, we developed a space- and time-resolved microwave
conductivity (STRMC) system, which was applied for photoconductivity
mapping of MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 (x = 0–1). A conventional time-resolved microwave conductivity
(TRMC) system uses a gigahertz electromagnetic wave as the probe and
a relatively large spot of a light pulse (ca. 0.2–2 cm2) as the excitation,46−48 which benefits the signal-to-noise
ratio of transient photoconductivity (Δσ); however, the
obtained Δσ is an averaged value over the spot area. Similarly
to the approach used in PL lifetime and TAS mapping, our STRMC system
is implemented by reducing the spot size to approximately 20 μm
(∼3 × 10–6 cm2) via microscope
optics and scanning an XY stage with automatic frequency tuning. In
contrast to PL and TAS imaging, which have sensitivities that can
be largely improved by efficient amplification of the probing photons,
STRMC has been challenging owing to its limited amplification electronics
and low spatial convergence with a large wavelength (approximately
a few centimeters). However, the evaluation of organic–inorganic
perovskites is possible because of their excellent photophysical properties.
We demonstrate the inhomogeneity in optoelectronics made of mixed-halide
lead perovskite films and examine its correlation with the crystallite
size and the lifetime of charge carriers.

Results and Discussion
Optical microscopic images of MAPbI3, MAPb(I0.7Br0.3)3, and MAPbBr3 are shown in Figure 1a–c; the stripe
patterns observed in MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 are
caused by the inhomogeneity of the spin-coated mpTiO2 (root-mean-square
height ∼33 nm and period ∼80 μm in the lateral
direction, analyzed by fast Fourier transform, Figure S1). STRMC evaluations were performed in a 1000 ×
1000 μm2 area by scanning a position of the laser
spot using a 200 μm step; thus, 6 × 6 = 36 points of transient
photoconductivity (Δσ) were obtained for each sample.
The map of Δσ maxima (Δσmax) of
MAPbI3 displays a distinct inhomogeneity, which is not
similar to the appearance of the film in the optical image (Figure 1d). Although the
spatial homogeneity of mixed-halide MAPb(I0.7Br0.3)3 is worse than that of MAPbI3 (Figure 1e), it is probably improved
in monobromide MAPbBr3 (Figure 1f). We note that the sample damage and resultant
change in Δσmax were confirmed to be negligible
using repeated measurements of MAPbI3 at the same position
(19 times, Figure S2). Although Δσmax varied in the map, the decay lifetimes were mostly unchanged.
Histograms of Δσmax statistics are shown in Figure 1g–i. The average
of Δσmax, Ave(Δσmax),
depends on the halide composition: 5.9 × 10–8 S cm–1 for MAPbI3, 1.2 × 10–8 S cm–1 for MAPb(I0.7Br0.3)3, and 6.7 × 10–8 S cm–1 for MAPbBr3. The diffusion length
of charge carriers has been reported to be 1 μm in Cl-doped
MAPbI3 (ref (14)) and 50–175 μm in single-crystal MAPbI3 (refs (15, 49)), whereas the grain size of solution-processed
multicrystalline MAPbI3 is typically a few hundreds of
nanometers to several micrometers.50 Therefore,
one point in the map (∼20 μm spot and 200 μm step)
includes multiple grains that are different from a neighboring point.
An intergrain charge transport is critical to a long-range mobility;51 however, the present STRMC is unable to resolve
the electronic properties of the grain interface.

Figure 2a displays
a detailed plot of Ave(Δσmax) against the bromide
content, the x (0–1) value of MAPb(I1–xBrx)3, and
the PbI2 precursor concentration of MAPbI3,
[PbI2]. The Ave(Δσmax) value of
MAPbI3 is superlinearly increased with [PbI2] (0.1–1 M), which is consistent with the increase in the
crystallite size and consequent improvement of electronic quality
(vide infra). In contrast, the mixed-halide perovskites exhibit a
downward convex trend with a minimum at x ≈
0.6 (the concentration of the mixed-halide precursor was fixed at
1 M). The standard deviations of Δσmax, Std(Δσmax), of MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 indicate
mostly an identical dependence on the corresponding Ave(Δσmax) values (Figure 2b).

Figure 2 (a) Average and (b) standard deviation of Δσmax evaluated by STRMC. The blue triangles and red circles correspond
to MAPbI3 (the lower horizontal axis is the precursor concentration,
[PbI2]) and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 (the upper horizontal
axis is the content of Br, x), respectively. The
solid lines are eye guides.

To quantify the spatial inhomogeneity of the electronic properties
of perovskite films, we plotted the inhomogeneity factor (IF), defined
as Std(Δσmax)/Ave(Δσmax), in Figure 3a. The
IF represents a dimensionless variation of Δσmax; thus, a small IF means a uniform film. The IF of MAPbI3 is as large as 1.1 at [PbI2] = 0.2 M; then, it decreases
dramatically to 0.5–0.3 at [PbI2] > 0.3 M. Accordingly,
both the IF and Ave(Δσmax) are improved by
increasing [PbI2]. On the other hand, the IFs of MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 remain almost constant at ∼0.4, in contrast to those
of MAPbI3. It should be noted that these IFs are larger
than the experimental errors observed in MAPbI3 at the
same position (IF = 0.023, Figure S2) and
at different positions measured on a piece of a homogeneous silicon
wafer (IF = 0.06, Figure S3). Accordingly,
the IF is an indicator of film inhomogeneity that cannot be evaluated
by conventional, nonspatial TRMC.

The solid lines are eye guides.

The crystallite sizes (L) of the perovskites
were
evaluated by XRD and the Scherrer relation52 (L ≈ 0.9λ(Δ2θ cos θ)−1, where λ is
the wavelength of an X-ray, Δ2θ is the full
width at half-maximum of the peak, and θ is the diffraction
angle). The most intense peak ascribed to (110) diffraction53 at 2θ = 14–15° was analyzed
and provided the L110 of MAPbI3 ([PbI2] = 0.1–1 M) and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 (x = 0–1), as shown in Figure 3b (XRD profiles are provided in Figures S4 and S5). The L110 of MAPbI3 increases in a sublinear manner from
17 nm at [PbI2] = 0.1 M to 80 nm at [PbI2] =
1 M, whereas that of MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 exhibits a minimum of 70 nm
at x = 0.4 and a maximum of 109 nm at x = 1. The (110) peak position of MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 is proportional
to the bromide content (x), which indicates a crystallographically
homogeneous mixing of iodide and bromide (Figure 3c). We note that a previous SEM characterization
with a helium ion microscope and a secondary ion mass spectrometer
(HIM-SIMS) visualized a nanometer-scale phase separation of I– and Br–, which would have an impact
on the device performance and phase stability.54 In contrast, the peak shift of MAPbI3 is marginal,
as small as +0.05°, over the entire [PbI2]. Interestingly,
the L110 curves of MAPbI3 and
MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 appear to be similar to those of Ave(Δσmax) and Std(Δσmax) (Figure 2), suggesting a correlation
between the crystallite size and Δσmax. Previous
studies have shown that large crystallites are advantageous to the
charge carrier mobility55 and device efficiency.56 However, the plots of Ave(Δσmax) and Std(Δσmax) vs L110 are rather scattered, particularly in the large-L110 region, although a rough, superlinear trend
is observed (Figure S6). Notably, an improved
general trend is found when the IF is plotted as a function of L110 (Figure 3d). This indicates that spatial inhomogeneity in a
few hundreds of micrometers is associated with a nanometer-scale crystallite
size.

Additionally, we examined the dependence of the millimeter-scale
Δσmax on the distance from the center of rotation
(y) during spin coating (Figure 4a). The Δσmax of MAPbI3 ([PbI2] = 1 M) exhibits a winding curve with a
period of ∼5 mm (Figure 4b), whereas the film thickness fluctuates in a different manner
(Figure 4c). The AFM
height images shown in Figure 4d demonstrate a position-dependent variation in the size and
shape of grains. Particle size analysis obtained grain sizes of ∼0.12
μm at y = 0 and 5 mm, which decrease to ∼0.06
μm at y = 10 mm and then increase to ∼0.24
μm at y = 15 mm (Figure 4e). The cross-sectional profiles along the
diagonal line of the image indicate a position-dependent variation
in height (Figure 4d), accompanied by a monotonic increase in surface roughness (Ra = 10.3, 21.9, 29.1, and 25.4 nm at y = 0, 5, 10, and 15 mm, respectively). The inhomogeneity
observed in the AFM images was possibly generated during the toluene
(poor-solvent) treatment during spin coating. Toluene was dropped
at the center of rotation and immediately spread; consequently, the
inhomogeneity of the perovskite precursor was created according to
the distance from the center. Moreover, the width of the quartz substrate
used in our study was 9 mm; therefore, some changes in the poor-solvent
treatment could occur at this distance. The abrupt drop observed in
Δσmax (Figure 4b) and the grain size (Figure 4e) at y = 10 mm could be
associated with the nonsymmetric shape of the substrate, which caused
insufficient interaction between the toluene and perovskite precursor.
Overall, Δσmax appears to increase with the
distance from the center, which is qualitatively linked to the grain
size, not the film thickness. Although a high Δσmax at long distances could favor high charge carrier mobility, the
roughness and large deviation of the grain size causes an electric
short of the layered solar cell, which would be detrimental to the
device performance. Our STRMC evaluations demonstrate that a spatial
inhomogeneity of Δσmax on sub-millimeter and
millimeter scales is associated mainly with the grain size and that
wet-processed organic–inorganic perovskites have a continuous
deviation in their spatiotemporal optoelectronic behaviors.

Conclusions
A
newly developed STRMC system was employed to investigate the
spatial inhomogeneity of multicrystalline MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 perovskite films. The statistics of Δσmax exhibited a variation in the IF, which depends on the precursor
concentration and the ratio of the mixed halide (I/Br). We observed
a general decreasing trend of the IF with the crystallite sizes of
MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1–xBrx)3, based on evaluations
with XRD and the Scherrer relation. This indicates that the crystallite
size, not the halide-mixing ratio, is key to the optoelectronic properties
and, therefore, the performance of the device.

Experimental Section
Sample
Preparation and Characterization
Perovskite
chemicals (MAI, MABr, PbBr2, and PbI2) were
purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry (TCI) Co., Ltd. and used as
received. A quartz substrate (40 × 9 × 1 mm3)
was cleaned with detergent, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized
water. A 200 nm thick mesoporous titanium dioxide (mpTiO2) layer was deposited onto quartz by spin-coating a diluted mpTiO2 paste (PST-18NR, JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd.) in ethanol
(paste/ethanol = 1:7 w/w), followed by sintering at 500 °C for
20 min. A 0.1–1 M (0.1 M step) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, purchased
from Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) solution of PbI2 and MAI
at 1:1 stoichiometry and a 1 M DMSO solution of PbX2 and
MAX (X = I or Br) at a designated stoichiometry (I/Br = 0.9:0.1, 0.8:0.2,
0.7:0.3, 0.6:0.4, 0.5:0.5, 0.4:0.6, 0.3:0.7, 0.2:0.8, 0.1:0.9, 0:1)
were prepared in a N2-filled glovebox. Subsequently, an
MAPb(I1–xBrx)3 (x = 0–1) precursor layer
was formed by spin-coating the DMSO solution with poor-solvent treatment
using toluene onto the rotating substrate. The resultant semitransparent
film was annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. For the STRMC evaluation,
the quartz/mpTiO2/perovskite sample was cut into a ∼3
× 3 mm2 piece (the film at the center of rotation
was used). For millimeter-scale STRMC, the sample was separated into
5 × 3 mm2 pieces and evaluated sequentially. Powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a Rigaku MiniFlex-600
X-ray spectrometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54187
Å) at room temperature in air. A surface profile of mpTiO2 on a quartz plate was measured using a Bruker Dektak XT surface
profiler. The AFM observations were performed using a Bruker Innova
system (a cantilever with a spring constant of 2 N m–1) in air.

Space- and Time-Resolved Microwave Conductivity
Figure 5 illustrates
a newly
designed STRMC system that consists of an in-house X-band microwave
circuit (a Rohde & Schwarz SMB100A signal generator, isolators,
waveguides, a circulator, a TE102 mode resonant cavity,
an iris coupling controller, an amplifier, a detector, and a Tektronix
DPO4000 oscilloscope), an Olympus BXFM optical microscope equipped
with a charge-coupled device camera and a near-UV-compatible objective
lens (model M Plan Apo NUV, Mitsutoyo Co., Ltd.), an XY stage (model
KY0830C, Suruga Seiki Co., Ltd.), and a Nd:YAG laser (model GCR-100,
Spectra-Physics Inc.; 5–8 ns pulse duration, 10 Hz) with a
mechanical shutter. The iris controller, which was driven by a stepping
motor, was fabricated using a three-dimensional (3D) printer. A 3
× 3 mm2 specimen was placed on a Teflon rod that was
fixed to the microwave cavity and the XY stage. The iris controller,
the XY stage, a shutter controller, and the oscilloscope were connected
to a computer and controlled by in-house software to perform automatic
scanning of the sample (a one-point measurement required approximately
3 min, including movement of the stage, tuning the iris coupling and
resonance frequency, opening the shutter, data averaging, and data
acquisition). The spatial resolution of our STRMC system was limited
by the spot size of the excitation laser pulse (∼20 μm),
not the accuracy of the XY stage (∼1 μm). The spot size
had a trade-off relationship with the signal intensity and the threshold
of significant sample damage. The sample size and the laser spot size
were evaluated by the optical microscope with a calibrated micrometer
(OB-MM 1/100 mm, Olympus). The effective spatial resolution was ∼45
μm, which was estimated by scanning the laser spot across an
edge of a silicon wafer (Figure S7). It
should be mentioned that a commercially available scanning microwave
microscope with an AFM cantilever has nanometer-scale resolution,
whereas it does not allow time-resolved measurements.57,58 Although microwave photoconductance decay technique, which scans
the sample under an arm of a microwave guide and light-pulse irradiation,
allows both lifetime and conductance measurements, its scanning area
is a few tens of centimeters.59 In our
STRMC system, continuous microwaves of approximately 9.1 GHz and third-harmonic
generation (355 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser (incident photon density I0 ∼ 1017 photons cm–2 pulse–1 after the objective lens) were used as
the probe and excitation, respectively. The experiments were performed
at 25 °C in air.
