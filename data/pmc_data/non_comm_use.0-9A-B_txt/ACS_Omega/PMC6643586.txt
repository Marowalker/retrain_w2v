Carminic acid (CA)
extracted from cochineal is widely used in food
additives as a natural colorant, and its potential risk to human health
makes its detection important. In this work, a layered doubled hydroxide
(LDH)–luminol–H2O2 system-based
chemiluminescence (CL) platform has been successfully applied for
CA sensing. The principle detection consists of two steps: first,
LDH adsorbs CA onto the surface via electrostatic attraction; second,
CA quenches the CL of the LDH–luminol–H2O2 system via the synergistic effect of CL resonance energy
transfer, reduction of reactive oxygen species, and occupation of
positively charged centers of brucite-like layers. With this
CL approach, 0.5 μM CA is detectable using a CL spectrometer,
and the limit of detection is 0.03 μM. This CL system exhibited
a linear response to CA in the concentration range from 0.5 to 10
μM. In addition, the practical application of the designed CL
sensing system is evaluated with dried pork slice samples.

Introduction
Carminic acid (CA),
an anthraquinone glycoside from dried cochineal
with high solubility due to its sugar and carboxyl group residues,
has been widely used as red colorant in food or beverage to make them
colorful and influence the consumer’s choice.1 Despite its relatively high chemical and biological stability,
the use of it as a colorant or additive is absolutely controlled by
laws and regulations because of its potential risk to human health.2 The allowable concentration range of CA in foodstuff
is set to be 25–500 mg/kg by the Standardization Administration
of China (GB 2760-2014). Thus, the exploration of a simple and rapid
CA detection method is important to understand its biological function
and prevent its contamination. Toward this goal, many CA detection
approaches based on high-performance liquid chromatography, voltammetry,
mass spectrometry, and spectrophotometry have been reported.3−8 Among them, spectrophotometric detection with easy operation and
rapid response has attracted growing attention.6,9 However,
the drawback of spectral overlapping generally diminishes the resolution
and accuracy of these methods. Therefore, it is of great significance
to develop a new spectrophotometric detection method with high sensitivity
and accuracy.

As one of the frequently used spectrophotometric
techniques, chemiluminescence
(CL) spectrophotometry has been widely used in the analytical-related
fields in recent years because of its characters of low background
noise, fast response, free excitation source, and simple instrumentation.10−13 The sensitivity of CL-based techniques is sometimes inhibited by
its low emission intensity. Interestingly, the nanomaterial-improved
novel CL systems with satisfying sensitivity have been widely investigated
because of the ever-increasing nanotechnology.14−20 For example, with the introduction of gold nanoparticles, the CL
signal of the luminol–H2O2 system is
greatly enhanced.16,21 Similarly, upon the addition
of layered double hydroxide (LDH), a 950-fold enhancement of the CL
signal of the luminol–H2O2 system is
found.22 The sensitivity of H2O2 detection using a luminol CL system is increased by
2 orders of magnitude with the assistance of LDH.23 By combining flow system and injection detector, sensitive
CL detection systems have been established for dyes, thiols, H2O2, and so forth.24,25 With the integration
of the electrochemical technique, sensitive peptide detection and
enzyme activity evaluation are achieved.26−28 The high sensitivity
and the excellent characters encourage us to develop a simple CL approach
for CA detection.

In this study, a facile and rapid method for
sensitive and accurate
CA detection based on the LDH–luminol–H2O2 CL system was reported. The detection mechanism is assigned
to the synergistic effect of CL resonance energy transfer (CRET),
reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and occupation of positively
charged centers of brucite-like layers by the anthraquinone motif,
which suppress the CL signal. The CL quenching effect of structural
motif CA was also systematically investigated for the first time.
In addition, this strategy shows high selectivity toward CA over other
small molecules, anions, and metal ions. Moreover, the simple CA sensing
approach exhibits satisfying sensitivity toward CA with a limit of
detection of 0.03 μM and shows a linear response in the concentration
range from 0.5 to 10 μM. Furthermore, the practical application
of the proposed method was validated by detecting CA detection in
dried pork slice samples.

Results and Discussion
CA-Induced CL Quenching
of the LDH–Luminol–H2O2 System
At the starting point, the CL
response of the LDH–luminol–H2O2 system to CA was investigated. As shown in Figure 1, the CL signal of the luminol–H2O2 system was dramatically enhanced by LDH. The
LDH-enhanced CL is attributed to the LDH-promoted adsorption of the
peroxide anion and luminol dianion, which facilitates the formation
of carbonate radicals and luminol radicals and is demonstrated in
previous reports.23 The promoted CL intensity
of the LDH–luminol–H2O2 system,
however, was dramatically inhibited with the addition of CA, suggesting
that CA possesses a high quenching efficiency to this CL system.

(a) and LDH–H2O2–luminol system

Structure-Mediated CL Quenching
For most of the quencher
studies, only energy or electron transfer between the whole molecule
and luminescence system is considered. However, the contribution of
the inside structural motif is rarely investigated. These motifs,
however, play important roles on the optical and/or electronic characters
of quenchers. In this study, the CL quenching effect of the structural
motif of CA was systematically studied. The molecular structure of
CA consists of an anthraquinone, a sugar residue, and a carboxyl group
(Figure 2). The sugar
residue and the carboxyl group do not cause CL inhibition according
to previous studies.24 In consideration
of the structural character of CA, the anthraquinone structure is
probably responsible for the CL quenching. To verify this hypothesis,
the effects of five different anthraquinone analogues (Figure S1) including alizarin (1,2-DHAQ), alizarin
red S, alizarin cyanin green F (ACGF), anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid
(ASA), and anthraquinone-1,8-disulphonic acid (ADA) on the CL profile
were studied. As showed in Figure S2, all five analogues showed CL quenching capabilities to the LDH–luminol–H2O2 system, indicating that anthraquinone indeed
is the possible structure responsible for CL quenching.

Figure 2 Molecular structure
of CA.

As reported in our previous work,
the LDH–H2O2–luminol system shows
a CL emission peak around 425
nm.22 As shown in Figure S3, both 1,2-DHAQ and ACGF showed an absorption peak around
425 nm, which is overlapped with the CL emission spectra of excited
luminol. The absorption spectra of ASA and ADA, however, have no overlap
with the CL emission spectra of excited luminol. They exhibited only
slight response to the CL profile of the LDH–H2O2–luminol system. These results suggest that the energy
transfer between 3-aminophthalate anions and anthraquinone analogues
might cause the CL quenching. However, ACGF also showed a visible
absorption peak around 430 nm, which provides an overlap with the
CL emission spectra of excited luminol, whereas its CL quenching capability
is very low, indicating that the energy transfer is not the only way
that leads to CL quenching. In addition, 1,2-DHAQ and ACGF, with similar
absorption profiles, showed totally different CL quenching capabilities,
further suggesting the importance of the structural motif to the CL
quenching performance.

Notice that 1,2-DHAQ exhibited the highest
CL quenching efficiency
over other four compounds, suggesting that the substituent group on
anthraquinone may also be essential to the CL quenching ability. Thus,
the CL quenching effects of various anthraquinone compounds with different
substituent groups should be investigated. According to Figure S2, anthraquinone compounds with only
sulfurate group showed weak quenching abilities, implying that the
CL inhibition is not caused by the sulfurate group. In contrast, the
group on the benzene ring largely promotes the CL quenching capability.
In this work, six anthraquinone compounds with different substituent
groups (hydroxyl group) were studied, including 2-hydroxy anthraquinone
(2-HAQ), 1-hydroxy anthraquinone (1-HAQ), 1,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone
(1,5-DHAQ), quinizarin (1,4-DHAQ), 1,2-DHAQ, and purpurin (1,2,4-THAQ).
According to Figure 3, the CL quenching capability is generally increased with the increasing
hydroxyl group number. Meanwhile, the position of the substituent
hydroxyl group also affects the CL quenching capability. These results
proved that the substituent hydroxyl group is important to the CL
quenching capability of anthraquinone compounds. In other words, hydroxyanthraquinone
possesses high CL quenching capability.

system to anthraquinone compounds. From 1 to 7: with the addition
of deionized water, 2-HAQ, 1-HAQ, 1,5-DHAQ, 1,4-DHAQ, 1,2-DHAQ, and

of 2-HAQ, 1-HAQ, 1,5-DHAQ, 1,4-DHAQ, 1,2-DHAQ, and 1,2,4-THAQ, respectively.

To realize the universality of
this substituent hydroxyl group-promoted
CL quenching capability, hydroxyanthraquinone-mediated CL quenching
of other two conventional systems, including LDH–H2O2–lucigenin system and LDH–H2O2–NaIO4 system were studied. As shown
in Figure 4, in all
three CL systems, 1,2,4-THAQ showed the highest CL quenching capability.
In addition, the trends of the substituent hydroxyl group-promoted
CL quenching efficiency in the LDH–H2O2–lucigenin system and the LDH–H2O2–NaIO4 system were consistent with that in the
LDH–H2O2–luminol system. All these
results suggest that 1,2,4-THAQ motif is responsible for the high
CL quenching efficiency of CA.

Mechanism of Hydroxyanthraquinone-Promoted
CL Quenching
It was found that negligible CL quenching induced
by hydroxyanthraquinone
compounds was observed without LDH, suggesting LDH is important to
get the hydroxyanthraquinone compounds and H2O2–luminol system close and assist the CL quenching. To first
understand the interaction between hydroxyanthraquinone compounds
and LDH, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR),
and surface charge characterizations of the LDH in the absence and
presence of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were performed. According
to Figure 5a, the prepared
LDH showed symmetric and sharp reflections for characteristic planes
of (003), (006), and (110). Also, the asymmetric reflections for (012),
(015), and (018) planes were observed. These characteristic reflections
indicate the existence of hydrotalcite-like structure.29,30 The addition of other hydroxyanthraquinone compounds, however, did
not change the XRD patterns of LDH. The remaining symmetric and asymmetric
reflections revealed the unchanged hydrotalcite-like structure, suggesting
that those hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were not inserted into the
interlayer of LDH. Because the introduction of LDH greatly enhanced
the CL quenching capability of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds, approaching
of these compounds to the CL system in the presence of LDH is necessary.
Therefore, adsorption of these compounds onto the LDH surface might
be the possible pathway to get them close. Such a hypothesis was first
proved by FT-IR characterization of LDH upon adding different hydroxyanthraquinone
compounds. The corresponding FT-IR spectra are shown in Figure 5b. The characteristic peaks
around 3491, 1660, 1383, and 665 cm–1 belong to
the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups, flexural vibration
of hydroxyl in H2O, asymmetric vibration of intercalated
CO32–, and metal–oxygen lattice
vibration, indicating the preservation of the hydrotalcite-like structure.31 Accordingly, peaks around 1270 and 1560 cm–1 that are assigned to the vibration of the anthraquinone
ring appeared when hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were added, suggesting
the adsorption of these hydroxyanthraquinone compounds onto the surface
of LDH.32,33 The adsorption of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds
was further verified by zeta potential measurements. As shown in Figure 5c, the surface charge
of LDH was determined to be +43.5 mV, which is consistent with previous
reports.34 High surface charge benefits
the adsorption of these compounds onto its surface. As expected, it
decreased over 25% after the addition of 100 μM hydroxyanthraquinone
compounds. Moreover, it can be seen that the hydrodynamic diameter
of LDH showed only a slight variation if 100 μM hydroxyanthraquinone
compounds were added (Figure 5d), suggesting that the addition of these compounds do not
cause the aggregation of LDH. This result also demonstrated that only
surface adsorption of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds happens.

size distribution (d) of LDH in the absence and presence of various
hyanthraquinone compounds. From I to VII: only LDH, 2-HAQ-absorbed

It is generally accepted that
the CL emission of the LDH–H2O2–luminol
system can be inhibited by some
small organic molecules or inorganic fluorophores through different
mechanisms, including CRET, reduction of generated ROS, or occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers.15 The latter two mechanisms inhibit the generation of light-emitting
intermediate 3-aminophthalate anions, whereas the former one only
transfers the energy of the intermediate. To figure out the CL quenching
mechanism, the absorption spectra of these hydroxyanthraquinone compounds
were measured. As shown in Figure S4, 1,2,4-THAQ
and 1,4-DHAQ with distinct absorption around 460–490 nm displayed
high CL quenching efficiencies. The maximum emission wavelength of
the intermediate 3-aminophthalate anion is nearby 425 nm, suggesting
that the CRET process may exist. However, 1,5-DHAQ with weak adsorption
around 430 nm also showed high CL quenching capability. Also, 1-HAQ
with high adsorption around 420 nm only showed weak CL quenching ability.
The different CL quenching behaviors of them may be due to the various
quantum yields.35 The quantum yields of
all six hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were also determined. The diverse
quantum yields may contribute differently to the CRET and lead to
different CL quenching capabilities (Figure S5a–c). These results indicate that the CRET is not the only way to cause
CL quenching. Notice that the phenol group possesses strong reducibility,
and the interaction between hydroxyanthraquinone and hydroxyl radical
(•OH) may also weaken the CL signal.36 To verify the influence of the phenol group,
the reducibilities of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were investigated
by using 7-hydroxy-coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (OHCCA) as the reporter.
It is reported that coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (3-CCA) can be oxidized
by •OH to form fluorescent OHCCA.37 With the addition of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds, the
fluorescence of OHCCA decreased (Figure S6). It was seen that 1,2,4-THAQ with strong CL inhibition capability
showed high reducibility (Figure S5d),
howbeit, 1-HAQ with weak CL quenching capability also showed high
reducibility. Also, 1,4-DHAQ and 2-HAQ with similar reducibilities
possess totally different CL quenching capabilities. In this case,
reducibility of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds play an important but
not the only role on CL quenching. In addition, the surface adsorption
of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds is also essential to CL quenching.
As mentioned above, the zeta potential of LDH dramatically decreased
after adding hydroxyanthraquinone compounds, indicating that the occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers is also important
to CL quenching. It should be noticed that only small differences
in the zeta potentials of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds-functionalized
LDH were observed. The small differences of zeta potential imply that
the CL quenching capability is partially related to the occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers. Therefore, we
suppose that the synergy of CRET, reduction of ROS, and occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers lead to the strong
CL quenching capability of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds. Taken together,
the CA-caused CL quenching consists of two steps: first, LDH adsorbs
it onto the surface via electrostatic attraction; second, CA quenches
the CL signal through the synergy of CRET, reduction of ROS, and occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers. The proposed
mechanism is shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Possible mechanism of CA-induced CL quenching.

Sensitivity and Selectivity of CA Sensing System
Although
these hydroxyanthraquinone compounds showed different CL quenching
capabilities, interestingly, they did not cause any evident change
in the CL emission profile. As shown in Figure S7, the addition of hydroxyanthraquinone compounds leads to
the decrease of CL intensity but without change of CL emission spectra.
In addition, the CL kinetics of LDH–H2O2–luminol system showed a negligible variation upon adding
hydroxyanthraquinone compounds. These results suggest that addition
of CA only induces the diminution of CL intensity. In other words,
the LDH–H2O2–luminol system can
act as a CL sensing platform for CA. The CL signal of the LDH–H2O2–luminol system is strong under alkaline
conditions, and our previous studies also indicate that the optimal
pH of CL quenching induced by other targets is almost nearby 9.5;
we thus performed all subsequent sensing experiments at pH 9.5. The
concentration of LDH at 30 mg/mL displays the maximum CL quenching
efficiency based on our previous study, which was used in the following
experiments.

Upon increasing the CA concentration, the CL signal
of the LDH–H2O2–luminol system
gradually decreased, as shown in Figure 7. The CL intensity showed a good linear relationship
(R2 = 0.991) versus CA concentration ranging
from 0.5 to 10 μM and is easily described by the linear equation, ICL = K[Q] + 4182.9, where ICL is the CL intensity, slope K is the CL quenching
constant, and [Q] stands for the CA concentration. The CL quenching
constant was calculated to be −3.25 × 108 M–1 by linear regression of the plot. The detection limit
toward CA was determined to be 0.03 μM (S/N = 3), which is more
sensitive than other reported methods.3,5,6,8,38 The relative standard deviation obtained from 11 times repeated
measurements of 2 μM CA was 2.9% (Figure S8), indicating the high accuracy of CA detection using this
proposed method.

Figure 7 CL signals of the LDH–H2O2–luminol
system upon adding CA with different concentrations. Inset image:
plots of the CL intensity vs the concentration of CA.

To verify whether the CA-induced CL quenching is
specific, the
CL signals were recorded with the addition of various small molecules,
metal ions and anions, including citric acid, sucrose, glucose, sodium
benzoate, HPO42–, SO42–, Mg2+, Al3+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Ba2+, K+, NH4+, Na+, Cl–, and NO3–. Although 1,2-DHAQ can also induce CL inhibition,
it was not considered in the specificity evaluation in this work.
It is known that 1,2-DHAQ is generally used as a colorant in cotton
products. However, it cannot be used as a food colorant because of
its high toxicity. In this case, we just investigated several possible
chemicals in the dried pork product to evaluate the specificity of
our proposed CL detection system. As indicated in Figure 8a, none of these small molecules,
metal ions, or anions (100 μM) could induce a conspicuous CL
decrease as CA (5 μM) did. In addition, neither small molecules
nor ions would interfere in the detection of CA (Figure 8b), revealing excellent selectivity
of the assay toward CA. Despite the negative charge, the high concentration
Cl– or NO3– did not
show any suppression effect on the CL signal. One possible reason
is the smaller size of these anions compared to that of CA. Thus,
the adsorption of the anion has just a slight effect on the capture
of the luminol dianion and peroxide anion. The high tolerance concentrations
of interfering molecules or ions suggest that this method is highly
specific even under a high concentration of interferents. Compared
to other reported works, this proposed method provides better or comparable
selectivity toward CA over other possible interferents. Therefore,
it could be concluded that the proposed method showed high selectivity
and sensitivity toward CA.

benzoate (100 μM), citric acid (100 μM), glucose (100

μM), Cl– (800 μM), NH4+ (800 μM), and NO3– (800
μM), respectively.

CA Analysis in Dried Pork Slice Samples
To evaluate
the applicability and reliability of the proposed method in real sample,
we tested CA in treated dried pork slice samples. Dried pork slice
was phased from the supermarket without treatment. CA was extracted
from the slice using a strand method. The CL signal of the LDH–H2O2–luminol system was suppressed after the
addition of real sample extraction (Figure S9), indicating the existence of carmine acid in dried pork slice samples.
The actual concentration of carmine acid was determined to be 4.36
μM by a standard addition approach (Table S1), which is much lower than the allowable concentration.
To further verify the accuracy of carmine acid detection in dried
pork slice samples, a current standard method for carmine acid detection
based on ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometry
was performed. The detected concentration of carmine acid was 4.02
μM. The low CA content indicates that the dried pork slice sample
from the supermarket meets the demand of food criterion. The comparable
results suggest that our method is capable for carmine acid detection
in a real sample. Moreover, the high recoveries of carmine acid determination
in the dried pork slice sample ranging from 97.3 to 99.8% also proved
the practical application of the proposed method. In a word, the proposed
method is feasible for detecting carmine acid in real samples.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a facile CL platform to detect carmine
acid based on the LDH–luminol–H2O2 system. Highly specific CA detection is achieved through the surface
adsorption and synergistic effect of CRET, reduction of ROS, and occupation
of positively charged centers of brucite-like layers, which provide
the CL sensor with satisfying interference rejection of over 20 folds
than other small molecules, anions, and metal ions. This approach
shows high sensitivity toward CA with a limit of detection of 0.03
μM. Our study also demonstrates an interesting combination of
electrostatic attraction and multiplex CL quenching mechanisms; thus,
new avenues for the design of luminol–H2O2 CL nanosensors for other analytes based on a similar strategy might
open up in the analytical and related fields.

Apparatus
Powder XRD measurements
were collected with
a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS Gmbh, Germany)
equipped with graphite-monochromatized Cu/Kα radiation (λ
= 1.5406 Å). The 2θ angle of the diffractometer was stepped
from 5° to 70° at a scan rate of 10°/min. FT-IR spectra
were recorded with a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo, American).
Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter were measured by using a
Zetasizer 3000HS nanogranularity analyzer (Malvern Instruments). Absorption
spectra were obtained by a UV-3900 UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Hitachi, Japan). The CL signal was measured on an ultraweak biophysics
CL (BPCL) analyzer (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Science,
Beijing, China). The CL spectrum of this system was measured using
a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer with the assistance of high-energy
cutoff filters from 400 to 540 nm (Hitachi, Japan). The fluorescence

the voltage is 700 V, and the scanning rate is 1200 nm/min. The quantum
yields were measured with a FLS980 transient steady-state fluorescence
spectrometer (Edinburgh, U.K.).

Synthesis of LDHs
The Mg–Al–CO3 LDHs were synthesized by coprecipitation
methods.22 The precipitation process was
carried out under low supersaturation
conditions at a constant pH. For an Mg/Al molar ratio of 3, solution
A consisted of 0.045 mol Mg(NO3)2 and 0.015
mol Al(NO3)3 dissolved in 60 mL deionized water.
Solution B consisted of 0.108 mol NaOH and 0.0075 mol Na2CO3 dissolved in 60 mL of deionized water. The two solutions
were added slowly into a 250 mL round-bottomed flask under vigorous
stirring, maintaining pH 10 at room temperature. The resulting white
slurry was aged for 24 h at 60 °C. Afterward, the precipitate
was collected by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with deionized
water for three times, and then the colloidal suspension was diluted
to the original concentration and stored for further use.

CL Measurements
The CL signals were monitored by a
static injection CL system, and the schematic diagram is shown in Figure S10. In brief, the mixture of 100 μL
of 10 μM H2O2 and 100 μL of CA-absorbed
LDH was placed in front of (photomuitplier) PMT. Then, 100 μL
of 200 μM luminol was injected into this mixture. The data integration
time of the BPCL analyzer was set at 1 s per spectrum, and a work
voltage of −1000 V was used for the CL detection. The CL signals
were monitored by PMT and imported to the computer for data acquisition.
CL signals from other hydroxyanthraquinone compounds were measured
using the same procedure. The CL emission spectra were measured through
a F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer by turning off the excitation
light source under flow injection. Briefly, H2O2 and CA absorbed LDH solutions were added into a quartz cuvette first,
and then luminol solution was introduced by flow injection through
an injector. To ensure the collection of CL emission spectra, a large
emission slit of 20.0 nm and a high scan speed of 1500 nm/min were
set.

Dried Pork Slice Analysis
For the detection of CA in
a real sample, commercial dried pork slice purchased from the supermarket
was used with pretreatment. Typically, 5 g dried pork slice sample
was first mixed with 10 mL of 2 M HCl in a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
Then, the mixture was heated in boiling water bath for 1 h. After
that, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, and another 15 mL ethanol
was added. The mixed solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000
rpm, and then, the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was
diluted 3000 times and immediately analyzed by the proposed method
using the above protocol.
