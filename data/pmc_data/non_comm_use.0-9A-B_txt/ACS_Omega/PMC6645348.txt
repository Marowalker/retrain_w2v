Diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP)-based polymers are often considered
as the most promising donor moiety in traditional bulk heterojunction
solar cell devices. In this paper, we report the synthesis, characterization
of various DPP-based copolymers with different molecular weights,
and polydispersity where other aromatic repeating units (phenyl or
thiophene based) are connected by alternate double bonds or triple
bonds. Some of the copolymers were used for device fabrication and
the crucial parameters such as fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage
(Voc) were calculated. The density functional
theory was used to optimize the geometries and deduce highest occupied
molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital gaps
of all the polymers and theoretically predict their optical and electronic
properties. Optical properties of all the polymers, electrochemical
properties, and band gaps were also obtained experimentally and compared
with the theoretically predicted values.

1 Introduction
In
bulk heterojunction solar cell (BHJSC) devices, a donor-conjugated
polymer is mixed with acceptor molecules to form an active layer where
the donor polymer1 absorbs light energy
to release electrons that pass to acceptor so that the charge separation
can happen to produce electrical energy. The performance of solar
cell devices2,3 often depends on the band gap
of the donor polymers4−6 because the lower band gap allows absorption of light
in the broad ranges of wavelength.7−9 Tuning of band gap is
also important for the matching of the energy levels of donor and
acceptor moieties for efficient transfer of electrons.10 As per the recent literature reports, fullerenes
have emerged as the material of choice for acceptor moiety; diketopyrrolopyrrole
(DPP)-based polymers11 have been established
as the most promising candidate for donor material in BHJSCs.12−15 Particularly, DPP core16,17 has attracted a lot
of attention recently because it is a fused aromatic core with a strong
electron withdrawing part. It consists of two carbonyl groups to enhance
intramolecular or intermolecular interactions via π–π
stacking of the polymer chains in solid states. Furthermore, DPP moiety
is linked with other aromatic moiety by double bond or triple bond
(linker) for fine tuning of electronic properties (typically, donor–acceptor
or D–A type). For example, isoindigo, benzodithiophene, dithienosilole
or substituted bithiophenes, and other aromatic moieties, cyclic amides
and diimides have been linked.13,18 In this context, the
incorporation of thiophene moieties with properly designed conjugated
D–A systems by a linker is more effective because of the electron-rich
characteristics. As a linker, double bonds or triple bonds19,20 have been extensively used to connect thiophene with different aromatic
moieties. For example, Wang and Chen groups highlighted the insertion
of ethylenic double bonds between heterocyclic rings such as thiophene
and selenophene.21,22 In this case, the double bond
linkage affects the π–π stacking distance between
the polymer chain planes and enhances the charge carrier mobility.
Chen et al. studied the comparison of two thiophenes in central vinylene
group copolymer with DPP units for field effect transistor applications.22 The same group extended the work with four thiophenes
and a central vinylene group (double bond linker) with DPP.23 On the other hand, Wu et al. reported the benefits
of triple bond as a linker for thermal stability and photovoltaic
performances in ethynyl DPP-based small molecules.24 In this case, the weak electron withdrawing nature due
to the sp-hybridized carbon atoms may lead to a lower HOMO (highest
occupied molecular orbital) level, and conjugated cylinder-like π-electron
density is more adaptable to conformational and steric constrains.
Ouyang and others explained the importance of the triple bond linker
for different polymers.25 Hany and others
reported the synthesis of N-alkylated DPP-containing compounds extended
through internal double bond linker.26

To the best of our knowledge, there is only limited report, if
any, of the detail comparative study of different DPP-based polymers
linked by both double bonds and triple bonds, by theoretical and experimental
investigations that could be useful for rational design of future
photovoltaic devices.

In this paper, we describe the synthesis
of five different DPP-based
homopolymers or copolymers consisting of thiophenes and other aromatic
moieties linked by triple bonds/double bonds (or both) to compare
their electrochemical, optical, thermal, crystalline, and other properties
and correlate with theoretical calculations. All the polymers have
multiple numbers of long alkyl chains27 to render solubility in common organic solvents and to influence
interchain interactions.28,29

the strategy of synthesis of those polymers using Sonogashira coupling.

studies are provided in the inset bottom figure of Scheme 1.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis, Characterization,
and Computational
Modeling
All the monomers were synthesized by modified literature
procedures, characterized by 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy, and described in Supporting Information. The polymers were synthesized by Sonogashira coupling polymerization
and characterized by NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC),
and detail account is provided in Supporting Information. Geometry optimization and computational studies were performed
using Gaussian 09 suit of program.

2.2 Optical
Properties of the Polymers: Theoretical
Predictions and Experimental Observation
Figure 1A depicts the theoretical UV–vis
absorption spectra of different polymers P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 calculated
at PBE0/6-31G* level of theory using Gaussian 09 suit of program,30 and Figure 1B depicts the experimental observation of UV–vis
absorption of the same polymers coated on quartz surface. In both
the cases, a broad range of absorption was noticed for all the polymers
covering almost the entire UV–vis range and reaching up to
the near-infrared region range. This is particularly important because
a wide range of absorption should ensure maximum utilization of sunlight
when the device would be fabricated using those polymers. This wide
range of absorption may be attributed to the presence of different
chromophores, conjugated double or triple bonds and strong intermolecular
interactions.31−33 Furthermore, calculation suggested two distinct absorption
bands in all the polymers, which were also experimentally observed.
Both the calculation and experimental observations showed the first
absorption band located at a shorter wavelength of 350–550
nm while the second strong absorption bands were located between 550
and 1100 nm which may be attributed to π–π* transition
and internal charge transfer effect. Minor variations in the λmax values and λonset values were observed
between the computational model and experimental observations. This
may be attributed to the fact that while theoretical value was calculated
based on one repeating unit for the computational feasibility; all
the polymers actually have multiple repeating units with a varied
number of degree of polymerization. As observed from Table 1, the number average molecular
weight (Mn), which depends on the degree
of polymerization can influence the experimental λonset or onset value significantly. For example, it was observed from Table 1 that polymer with
a minimum value of number average molecular weight (P2 with Mn value of 3824 g/mol) showed comparatively
a less value of λonset in thin film at 848 nm while
polymer with an Mn value of 6000–7000
g/mol showed a higher λonset value of 908–926
nm. A similar observation was noticed for λmax values
in solution (Supporting Information) and
in thin films. This may be attributed to a large amount of extended
conjugations for polymers with higher molecular weights. Moreover,
the absorption was red-shifted to more than 150 nm in thin films than
in solution, possibly due to strong intermolecular interactions. Furthermore,
both computational calculations and experimental findings indicated
that the choice of linker like double bond (polymer P3 or P5) or triple
bond (P1, P2, or P4) does not significantly influence the primary
optical absorption spectra.

2.3 Band Gaps of Polymers: Theoretical Prediction
and Experimental Determination by the Electrochemical Method
It can be seen from frontier molecular orbital (FMO) pictures (Table 2) that both the HOMO
and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) are delocalized on
the DPP moiety, and all the electronic transitions appear to be π–π*
in nature. The calculated HOMO–LUMO energy levels are summarized
in Table 1. Computational
studies indicated a minimal effect of structural variations on the
band gap although theoretically predicted band gap values were lower
while considering the repeating units two rather than one (Supporting Information, Table S3). However, some
variation of band gaps was observed for all the polymers when HOMO,
LUMO, and band gaps were determined experimentally by using cyclic
voltammetry (CV) using the following equations taking the respective
onset values of oxidation and reduction states.34 (Figure 2, Table 3).

onsets of oxidation and reduction in CV curves.

a Taking into account of one repeating
unit.

In this case, it was
found that the band gap was almost unchanged
at 1.8 eV when the weight average molecular weight (Mw) was less than 20 000 g/mol (for P1, P2, or P4).
A slight decrease of band gap to 1.7 eV was observed when the weight
average molecular weight (Mw) was 20 000
(for P3) and a much lower band gap was observed at 1.5 eV when the
weight average molecular weight was higher at almost 24 000
g/mol for the polymer P5. The lowering of band gaps for polymers of
higher molecular weights may be attributed to a greater degree of
polymerization leading to extended conjugation which was not accounted
in theoretical calculations.

2.4 Characterization by Spectroscopy
and GPC
Spectroscopic techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
were used
to confirm the structures of all the polymers, monomers, and all the
synthesized compounds used to prepare various monomers. The 1H NMR spectra of all the polymers (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5) and one of
the monomers [1,4-diethynyl-2,5-bis(dodecyloxy)benzene bearing two
alkyne groups] are shown in Figure 3A,B, respectively, for comparison purpose while all
the other relevant 1H, 13C NMR spectra are provided
in Supporting Information. While all the
peaks in 1H NMR spectra of monomers appeared sharp, usual
broad peaks appeared for all the polymers because of their polydisperse
nature. A characteristic peak at 3.33 ppm was observed for the monomer
due to the presence of alkyne protons, which was attenuated (polymer
P1 and P2) or completely disappeared (polymer P3, P4, P5) after polymerization
because of effective coupling between alkynes and aromatic bromides.
Slight appearance of peak at 3.33 ppm after polymerization for polymer
P1 and P2 may be attributed to end alkyne groups. The signals in the
range of 7.52–7.23 and 7.01–6.86 ppm are related to
phenyl protons and peaks at 8.94, 7.64 ppm are assigned to DPP thiophene
protons. Peaks in the range of 4.02 ppm are related to α hydrogen
containing alkyl chains directly connected to the DPP-linked nitrogen
atom. In the range of 6.99–7.16 ppm is the peak related to
thiophene proton adjacent to alkynes in polymer PDPPPETEP-P4. In the
range of 7.17–7.20 ppm is the peak for protons of internal
double bond between the thiophene and phenyl ring moieties of polymer
PDPPPETVP (P5).

PDI = 3.88, PDPPPETVP: Mn = 7350, Mw = 20 064, PDI = 2.73).

GPC was used to evaluate the molecular weights
and polydispersity
of the polymers (Figure 3C). The weight average molecular weight was observed between 12 000
and 24 000 g/mol with moderate polydispersity of 2–4,
indicating low to moderate degrees of polymerization in most cases.
Minimum polydispersity was observed for the homopolymer, whereas polydispersity
was more for the copolymers, which may be attributed to reactivity
difference between the dibromide monomers.

2.5 Thermal
Study
Thermal stability of
all the polymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA),
and phase transition was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) (Figure 4A,B,
respectively). The TGA analysis reveals that the onset points of the
weight loss with 5% weight-loss of those polymers exhibited sufficiently
high thermal decomposition temperatures (Td-5% weight lost) with 332 °C for P1, 358 °C for P2, 310
°C for P3, 309 °C for P4 (309.09), and 364 °C for P5.
This indicates that all polymers have good thermal stability, which
is important for application point of view while applying for device
fabrication process. Furthermore, we observed from DSC (Figure 4B) that there is no thermal
transition such as melting, glass transition, or amorphous–crystalline
transition between 20 and 250 °C, indicating its processability
in a wide range of temperature.

at a heating rate of 5
°C min–1 under an N2 atmosphere

min–1 under an N2 atmosphere.

2.6 Other Parameters Related
to Photovoltaic Performances
The polymers were used separately
for photovoltaic device fabrications,
and various device parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factors (FF) were evaluated after
plotting current density–voltage (J–V) curve for all the polymers (Figure 5, inset table). The low fill factor (FF)
values in most cases which may lead to low device efficacy can be
attributed to appreciable extend of crystallinity of polymers as observed
from X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure 5B), causing a phase separation during device fabrication.35,36 The phase separations were observed in atomic force microscopy (AFM)
also, which showed pondlike structures (Figure 5C) when the device architecture was simulated
using donor polymer and fullerenes.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
successfully used Sonogashira coupling to
prepare several novel DPP-based homopolymers and copolymers with weight
average molecular weights (Mw) ranging
from 12 000 to 23 000 g/mol and polydispersity index
(PDI) ranging from 2.0 to 3.8. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
predicted a broad range of absorption of light in the wavelength range
of 300–1100 nm for all the polymers with two distinct bands
at 350–500 and 550–1100 nm, respectively. Experimental
UV–vis spectroscopic study on thin films corroborated this
general trend. However, a dependence of experimental onset absorption
value on the number average molecular weight of polymers was observed.
Theoretical calculation indicated a less dependence of band gap values
on nature of linkers (double or triple bond) or structure of aromatic
repeating units (thiophene or benzene), while experimental determination
of band gaps from CV experiments proved their dependence on weight
average molecular weights. The low fill factor and open circuit voltage
for the devices fabricated using those polymers may be attributed
to crystallinity, nature of linkers, and other factors which might
have led to low device efficacy. Those observation and theoretical
calculations should be useful to design suitable polymer for improved
device fabrication.

at 70 °C for overnight. The general organic photovoltaic device

methyl ester/LiF/Al configuration and the hole transport material
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS)
Clevios PH solution was spin-coated onto the clean ITO substrates
at 5000 rpm, followed by annealing at 130 °C for 15 min in ambient
conditions to give a thickness of ∼40 nm. BHJ devices based
an active layer blend were prepared by dissolving the polymers and
[6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene
with different D–A weight ratios with the weight ratio of 1:1.5
(16 mg/mL). The mixed solution was spin-coated onto the top of the
PEDOT–PSS layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s and then dried at room
temperature for 30 min. The thickness of the active layer is about
100 ± 5 nm. Finally, 1 nm of LiF electron extraction layer was
deposited on the active layer. As LiF may reduce the work function
of cathode also preventing Al diffusion into the active layer which
is leading to efficient electron extraction followed by Al top electrode
was deposited onto the top of LiF by thermal evaporation under high
vacuum condition (10–6 Torr). The active area of
the devices was found to be 0.08 cm2. The device characterization
was carried out under an inert condition (Ar-filled glovebox) using
an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 80 mW/cm2.

4.5 General Procedure for Polymerization
To a hot gun-dried 25 mL two neck round bottom flasks, we added dibromo

along with 10 mol percentage Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and 20 mol percentage CuI in N2 purged mixture
of solvent (chlorobenzene + DIPA). The reaction mixture was again
degassed with N2 gas, and the reaction medium was maintained
at 70 °C for 48 h under an N2 atmosphere. After completion
of polymerization, the crude polymer was purified with Soxhlet, extracted
with hot methanol, hexane, and acetone to remove the monomers and
oligomer impurities to obtain pure blue color polymer fraction from
chloroform and chlorobenzene.
