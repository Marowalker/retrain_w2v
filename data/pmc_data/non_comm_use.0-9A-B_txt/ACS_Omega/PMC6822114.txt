Each
year, hundreds of millions of tires are produced and ultimately
disposed into nature. To address this serious environmental issue,
devulcanization could be one of the sustainable solutions that still
remains as one of the biggest challenges across the globe. In this
work, sulfur-vulcanized natural rubber (NR) is mechanochemically devulcanized
utilizing a silane-based tetrasulfide as a devulcanizing agent, and
subsequently, silica (SiO2)-based rubber composites are
prepared. This method not only breaks the sulfur–sulfur cross-links
but also produces reactive poly(isoprene) chains to interact with
silica. The silica natural rubber composites are prepared by replacing
30% fresh NR by devulcanized NR with varying contents of silica. The
composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties, tear strength,
abrasion resistance, and dynamic mechanical properties as compared
with the fresh natural rubber silica composites. The tensile strength
of devulcanized rubber-based silica composites is ∼20 MPa,
and the maximum elongation strain is ∼921%. The devulcanized
composites are studied in detail by chemical, mechanical, and morphological
analyses. Thus, the value added by the devulcanized rubber could attract
the attention of recycling community for its sustainable applications.

==== Body
Introduction
About 70% of the rubber grown in the world
finds it use in tires.
The quantity of waste tires discarded worldwide every year is closely
800 million (10 million tons), and taking into consideration that
the amount of natural and synthetic rubber in tires is approximately
60%, about 6 million tons of scrap tires are generated each year.
Note that the developed countries have been paying a great deal of
attention to the widespread utilization of discarded tires to attain
the goals of protecting the environment and recycling resources.1−3 As a solution to the disposal problem of waste rubber, landfilling,
incineration, pyrolysis, and devulcanization/reclaiming of waste rubber
products have been proposed. The European Commission forbade the landfilling
of end-of-life tires since 1999. Among various techniques, the least
enviable disposal is discarding the material. This is a situation
that does not add value from the product side, and besides, the value
added is negative. Although the threatening pollution problem due to waste tire could
be circumvented by using them as a heat source, this is not a favored
method from the environmental aspect. For example, when waste rubber
products are incinerated, secondary pollutants such as harmful gases
and obnoxious smell are produced, which largely pollute air. Moreover,
the huge amount of CO2 generated due to incineration of
scrap rubber is also responsible for global warming. Devulcanization/reclaiming
of scrap rubber is, therefore, the most advantageous technique to
solve the disposal problem. Devulcanization/reclaiming not only protects
our habitat but also saves our nonrenewable petroleum resources from
which the raw material is originated.

Therefore, the most efficient
method for disposal of scrap tires
is devulcanization/reclaiming, which includes mechanochemical,4−7 ultrasound,8−10 microwave,11−13 or microbial desulfurization
technique.14,15 A good amount of exhaustive information
can be gathered on the up-to-date information of rubber devulcanization
in different reviews available in the literature.16−20 Thermomechanical reclaiming of rubber industry wastes
was performed in an industrial twin-screw extruder at various barrel
temperatures in the range of 80–220 °C.21 In this process, a high extent of reclaiming (∼90%)
was achieved. The measurement of swelling values and the corresponding
Horikx plot indicated that more selective sulfur bond scission occurred
when the sample was treated at 80 and 100 °C. Chemothermomechanical
devulcanization of waste rubber powder was performed using 4,4′–dithiobis(2,6-di-t-butylphenol)
in an internal mixer at 180 and 200oC.22 The results suggest that higher temperatures and devulcanizing
agent concentrations lower the cross-link density and Mooney viscosity
of devulcanized rubber and enhance the sol content of devulcanized
rubber. Choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) such
as ChCl:urea, ChCl:ZnCl2, and ZnCl2:urea are
used for devulcanization of ground rubber tire (GTR).23 Here, GTR are mixed with different DESs followed by ultrasonic
(37 kHz) treatment at 180 °C to investigate the extent of devulcanization.
It was noticed that a greater extent of devulcanization was obtained
at relatively high temperature and mass ratio of rubber to DESs due
to the considerable decrease in the cross-link density of the devulcanized
GTR. Mechanochemical devulcanization of natural rubber24 and styrene/butadiene rubber25 vulcanizates was carried out using different concentrations
of bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide at ∼70 °C in
an open-roll mixing mill. The findings indicated that a higher extent
of devulcanization was achieved when the devulcanization time is 40
min and the corresponding devulcanizing agent concentration is 6 phr.
Microwave electromagnetic energy was utilized to devulcanize waste
tire rubber (WTR) powder with the ultimate goal of producing a composite
material by its incorporation in an epoxy resin.26 The waste tire rubber powder (WTR) and the devulcanized
waste tire rubber powder (DWTR) were independently used to grow epoxy
resin-based composites, and their performances were evaluated. The
results showed that the epoxy composites loaded with DWTR have superior
mechanical properties compared to WTR-loaded epoxy composites. Ultrasonically
devulcanized (dose, 15 kHz) waste rubber was blended with SBR at various
concentrations, and subsequently, the blends were treated with gamma
irradiation.27 The results indicated that
the highest compatibility for compounding and revulcanization was
observed as compared to the fresh SBR compound. Devulcanization of
ground truck tire rubber was performed by supercritical CO2 in the presence of diphenyl disulfide as the devulcanizing agent.28 The reaction conditions such as temperature
and pressure were maintained at 180 °C and 15 MPa, respectively,
and the ratio between the rubber and devulcanizing agent was 1:10.
The results show that the treatment in the presence of diphenyl disulfide
with supercritical CO2 decreases the cross-link density
of devulcanized rubber and increases the gel fraction and the compatibility
of devulcanized rubber with the fresh rubber.

On the other hand,
silica is gaining importance in the rubber industry
not only for the improvement of the tear strength and abrasion resistance
but also for the enhancement of the dynamic mechanical properties
such as wet skid resistance and rolling resistance.29,30 However, incorporation and homogeneous dispersion of silica filler
into nonpolar rubbers such as natural rubber (NR), styrene butadiene
rubber (SBR), and butadiene rubber (BR) without any compatibilizer
are difficult tasks because it arises out of the strong filler–filler
interaction and the strong agglomeration tendency of silica particles
resulting from the hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces, leading
to the poor compatibility between the silica and rubber matrix. Precisely, these factors restrict the application of silica in different
product developments. Furthermore, the −OH groups on the silica
surface may constitute hydrogen bonds with the polar groups, present
in the accelerator compound, resulting in adsorption of basic accelerators
on the acidic surfaces of silica, and thus, the optimum cure time
increased.31 To overcome these difficulties
in silica surface modification by different chemicals seems to be
a practical and efficient approach. Different organosilanes used to
modify silica surface contain hydrolyzable alkoxy groups at one end
that can interact with the silanol group on the silica surface, and
the hydrophobic group on the other hand can bridge with the rubber
chain. Thus, organosilanes can successfully increase the compatibility
of organosilane-modified silica in the rubber matrix and enhance the
extent of dispersion.32−35 The silica surface modification by plasma treatment could improve
the dispersion of filler into the rubber matrix and filler–rubber
interaction.36 In this study, the plasma
polymerization of acetylene (coating) on silica surface was carried
out. The as-grown surface-modified silica was then used as filler
in SBR, and hence, its performance was compared with those of the
untreated and silane-modified silica composites. The result shows
that plasma polymerization and silane modification of silica particles
significantly improve their homogeneous dispersion in the SBR matrix.
However, SBR vulcanizates having plasma-treated silica show enhancement
in tensile strength, improvement in modulus, and acceptable elongation
at break. In an alternative approach, functional groups such as hydroxyl
groups,37,38 carboxyl group,39,40 epoxy groups,41−43 and alkoxysilane groups44 provide the rubber matrices as reactive functional sites and make
them vulnerable to react with hydroxyl groups of the silica and impart
reinforcement into the silica/rubber composite. Among these different
types of functionalization, epoxy group has been proven to be the
best due to strong silica/rubber interaction.41−43 The silica
surface modification with vulcanization accelerator has opened up
new avenues for the development of high-performance rubber composites.
Zhong et al.45 demonstrated the superior
mechanical performance of vulcanization accelerator modified silica
of styrene butadiene rubber vulcanizates. Here, accelerator ethylenethiourea
(ETU) was chemically grafted onto the surface of silane-modified silica
to form ETU-modified silica. Owing to uniform dispersion of the ETU-modified
silica in the styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) matrix, a strong filler–rubber
interaction is observed, and the developed material shows excellent
mechanical properties compared to the unmodified silica/SBR composite.
The improved rubber–filler interaction in silica/rubber composites
is achieved by modification of silica surface with the antioxidant,
2-mercaptobenzimidazole (MB).46 The developed
MB-modified silica/SBR composite exhibits better dispersion and improved
mechanical behavior in comparison with the unmodified silica/SBR composite.
Chen et al.47 synthesized silica-supported
sulfur monochloride by the chemical interaction between chlorine atom
and the silanol hydroxyl group. These functionalized silica nanoparticles
can successfully cross-link the rubber chains without sulfur and dramatically
enhance the filler–rubber interaction, which significantly
improves the dispersion of modified silica in the NR matrix, and thus,
enhancement of the mechanical properties occurs. Silanization modification
of silica by bis(3-triethhoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT) was
carried out using a phosphonium ionic liquid (PIL) catalyst.48 It was found that phosphonium ionic liquid efficiently
catalyzed the silanization reactivity between silica and TESPT in
the rubber matrix. The phosphonium ionic liquid reacts with the silanol
group on the silica surface to form more nucleophilic silanolate anions,
which facilitates the condensation reaction with the ethoxy group
in TESPT and increases the degree of silanization. Moreover, morphological
and interfacial studies illustrate that the dispersion of silica and
interfacial interaction between silica and rubber matrix improved
in the SBR/PIL-TESPT-silica composite with respect to the SBR/TESPT-silica
composite. SBR/graphene composites having different and tailored surface
chemistry were synthesized through in situ chemical reduction of graphene
oxide (GO).49 The results showed that the
COx fraction greater than 0.2 exhibited
a strong effect on the dispersion of graphene in the rubber matrix,
whereas the COx fraction less than 0.2
exerted a considerable and positive effect on the interfacial interaction.
A simple process is developed to grow recyclable, mechanically strong,
and macroscopically responsive elastomer vitrimers through exchangeable
β-hydroxyl ester bonds into the epoxidized natural rubber–carbon
dot interphase50 and dynamic dual cross-links
of boronic ester bonds and Zn2+ – O coordination
into a commercial epoxidized natural rubber.51 The so-developed material undergoes remarkable improvement of mechanical
properties.

In the present work, the devulcanization of the
NR (DeVulcNR) vulcanizate
and simultaneous modification of the rubber backbone by tetrasulfane
are made. The as-grown devulcanized NR is used to prepare the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates that are analyzed by equilibrium swelling experiments,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and differential scanning calorimetric experiments, and the
morphology of the composites is evaluated by scanning electron microscopy.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Natural rubber (NR) (RSS1, Rubber Board,
India), bis(3-triethoxysilyl propyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT) used as a
devulcanizing agent, zinc oxide (SD Fine Chem., India), stearic acid
(Loba Chemie, India), sulfur (SD Fine Chem., India), N-cyclohexyl-benzothiazyl-sulfenamide (CBS), and toluene (SD Fine
Chem., India) were used without any further purification. The silica
used was precipitated silica (Ultrasil VN-3, Evonik Resource Efficiency
GmbH, Wesseling, Germany), and its specific surface area was about
200 m2/g.

Preparation of Ground Natural Rubber (GNR)
Ground natural
rubber (GNR) was produced from sulfur-cross-linked natural rubber
obtained by mixing of natural rubber (100 phr) with ZnO (5 phr), stearic
acid (2 phr), CBS (1.2) phr, and sulfur (1.8) phr using a laboratory
size two-roll mixing mill at a friction ratio of 1:1.25. The NR compounds
were vulcanized at 150 °C for 3.5 min (optimum cure time) and
subsequently aged at 70 ± 2°C for 96 h. The aged
cross-linked NR samples were ground in a two-roll mixing mill to produce
GNR. The particle size of GNR ranges from 0.5–0.8 mm. The physical
properties like sol content, density, and cross-link density of GNR
are found to be 6%, 0.936 g/cm3, and 1.034 × 10–3 mol/cm3, respectively. The thermogravimetry
analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere indicates that the rubber
hydrocarbon content, oil content, and char residue are 89.7, 2.8,
and 5.6%, respectively.

Preparation of the Devulcanized Natural Rubber
(DeVulcNR)
The GNR (100 g) was extensively mixed with the
TESPT (6 mL) (devulcanizing
agent) and subsequently soaked for 24 h prior to devulcanization and
then transferred to an open-roll mill. Milling was then carried out
by an open two-roll mixing mill at a friction ratio of 1:1.25 for
40 min at 70 °C since the devulcanization time and devulcanizing
agent concentration were optimized in our previous paper.24 It is observed that with an increase in devulcanization
time, band formation takes place on the roll, and the powder material
is converted to a homogeneous elastomeric material.

Preparation
of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 Composites
Rubber compounds
were developed using the formulation presented in Table 1. Mixing of fresh
NR and DeVulcNR was done in a fixed ratio of 70:30 (phr:phr), and
the compounding additives were added in a laboratory using a two-roll
mill of roll size of 3.8 mm × 8.4 mm with a friction
ratio of 1:1.25. In such formulations, the compounding additives like
zinc oxide, stearic acid, sulfur, and accelerator were added in the
proportion based on a total of 100 g of rubber independent of the
proportion of DeVulcNR, as it was published by the author52 that the compounding ingredients in devulcanized
rubber derived from the parent compound were inactive. Here, the CBS/semi-EV
sulfur vulcanization system is used as the mechanical properties of
the CBS/semi-EV system are better compared to those of the EV and
the CV systems.53 To optimize the silica
content in the NR/DeVulcNR blend system, varied proportions of silica
(10–40 phr) were incorporated into the rubber matrix, and the
evaluation of properties mentioned in the subsequent section clearly
indicates that the optimum concentration of silica is 30 phr. The
effectiveness of DeVulcNR as a compatibilizer is compared with that
of the fresh NR/SiO2 composite both in the presence and
absence of TESPT, a well-known silica coupling agent. In the formulations
Silica-10–Silica-40, the silica content varies from 10–40
phr; the formulation Silica-30 (control) contains only fresh NR along
with silica (30 phr) and the formulation Silica-30 (control-TESPT)
contains fresh NR, silica (30 phr), and TESPT (1.5 phr). Initially,
NR and DeVulcNR were mixed on the two-roll mill to prepare a compound
and masticated thoroughly for 3–4 min. The compounding additives,
for example, ZnO and stearic acid, were then added to the rubber compound
for 1–2 min. Then, silica was added in three steps ( silica) in a period
of 7–8 min to
the rubber compound and mixed thoroughly, and after complete addition
of silica, the material was thoroughly mixed for 2 min. Then, sulfur
was added to it, followed by the addition of CBS. In the case of the
silica (control-TESPT) compound, silica was added along with TESPT
in three steps ( silica and  TESPT) in a period of
7–8 min to
the rubber compound.

The curing parameters of the compounds were measured by the Elastograph
67.12 (Göttfert, Germany) at 150oC. The samples
were then cured in press at 150oC, and 34 MPa pressure
for the respective optimum cure time (t = t90) was noted from rheograms. The cure rate
index (CRI) of the compounds was calculated from the equation as follows 1  

Characterization
The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the vulcanizates
were obtained in the ATR mode using a Bruker, GmbH (model: ALPHA),
FTIR spectrophotometer.

Equilibrium swelling measurements of
the cured rubber samples were
obtained using toluene at room temperature (25oC) as per
ASTM D471-16a.The equilibrium swelling value was used to evaluate
the average molecular weight between cross-links Mc by applying the Flory–Rehner equation54 as follows 2  where Vrf is the volume fraction of NR/DeVulcNR vulcanizates
in the swollen specimen, Vs is the molar
volume of the solvent (for toluene, Vs = 106.2 cm3/mol), dr is the density of rubber vulcanizates, and χ is the interaction
parameter (for NR/toluene system, χ = 0.393).

The rubber–filler
interaction was measured using the Kraus55 equation as follows 3  where Vr0 is the volume fraction of the gum vulcanizates, f is the volume fraction of filler obtained from the ratio
of volume of filler and the total volume of the recipe, and m is the rubber–filler interaction parameter. The
volume fraction (Vrf) of rubber network
in the swollen phase was calculated from the equation of Ellis and
Welding.56

The degree of reinforcement
was evaluated from the Cunneen and
Russell57 equation as follows 4  where Vr0 and Vrf are the same as defined
earlier, z is the weight fraction of filler, and a and b are constants.

Tensile and
tear strengths of the composites were evaluated by
a universal tensile machine (DigiUTM-2000 V) as per ASTM D 412 and
ASTM D 624, respectively. The abrasion resistance of the composites
was measured using a DIN abrasion tester following ASTM D 5963.

To get an idea about the dispersion of silica in NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites, a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study of
the tensile fractured surface was performed on Zeiss EVO-MA10 at 0o tilt angle. The surface of the sample was coated by gold
using a sputtering technique.

The calorimetric glass temperature
(Tg) was determined using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). Measurements
were done in the temperature range of −100 to 25 °C, in
a nitrogen atmosphere (purge) using a DSC apparatus (model: Netzsch,
Germany, model no. 204 F1).

The dynamic mechanical characteristics
such as storage modulus
(E′) and loss tangent ( tan δ)
of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites were measured using Eplexor
2000 N (Gabo Qualimeter, Ahlden, Germany) at a frequency of 10 Hz.
The sample was tested in the temperature range from −100 to
100 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The samples were
analyzed in the tension mode with 1% static pre-strain and 0.5% oscillating
dynamic strain.

Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) analysis
of the composites
was done in an X’Pert-Pro, Pan Analytical diffractometer using
CuKα (λ = 1.540 nm) radiation at a generator voltage of
40 kV and a current of 30 mA with a scanning rate of 1o/min at room temperature in 2θ = 5 to 90o.

Results
and Discussion
Curing Characteristics
Figure 1a shows rheograms
obtained on the elastograph,
which indicate the cure behavior of all the compounds. From Figure 1b, we find that with
increasing silica loading, both the scorch time (ts2) and the optimum cure time (t90) of the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 compound show a
gradual decrease with the increase in silica content. The decreases
in optimum cure time (t90) and scorch
time (ts2) with silica loading
may be due to the thermal history of the compounds. During mixing,
the increasing silica loading significantly increases the compound
viscosity and thus increases the mixing temperature. As in the present
study, curatives are added into the rubber just after silica loading;
therefore, the compounds with high silica loading are subjected to
higher temperature during mixing than the compounds with low silica
loading. Thus, both t90 and ts2 decrease with the increase in silica loading.
Since the evaluation of the overall mechanical performance of the
NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 compound indicates that the optimum concentration
of silica is 30 phr, therefore, it is compared with that of the NR/SiO2 and the NR/SiO2/TESPT systems with same silica
loading (30 phr). The results show that both of the ts2 and t90 of the
NR/SiO2 are much higher compared to those of either the
NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 or NR/SiO2/TESPT compound.
This is probably due to less accelerator molecules adsorbed by the
silanol groups when the blend system contains DeVulcNR or TESPT as
a compatibilizer. The NR/SiO2/TESPT compound shows higher t10 and t90 than NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2, as shown in Figure 1b. This may be attributed to the stronger
interfacial adhesion between SiO2-TESPT and NR, leading
to more pronounced confinement of NR chains, which in turn, slows
down the vulcanization as compared to that in the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 compound. The difference between t90 and t10, (t90 – t10) as presented in Figure 1c is used to determine
the vulcanization rate, where a higher vulcanization rate indicates
lower (t90 – t10). From the result, it is evident that the (t90 – t10)
of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 is lower compared to that of NR/SiO2/TESPT, which is further lower than that of the NR/SiO2 for a 30 phr silica loading in all the rubber compounds.
The DeVulcNR containing the pendent ethoxy group modifies the silica
surface by chemical interaction with the silanol groups on the silica
surfaces, decreases the tendency of adsorption of accelerator compounds
on silica surfaces, and consequently increases the vulcanization rate.
The extent of cure (MH – ML) increases with an increase in silica loading.
The extent of cure is noticed to increase continuously with the increase
in silica loading, as presented in Figure 1c. This is due to the fact that the chemical
interaction between DeVulcNR containing pendent ethoxy groups with
silanol groups on the silica surface could result to additional cross-links
in the DeVulcNR phase showing an overall increase in the cross-link
density of the vulcanizates. The different NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 compounds containing DeVulcNR as an interfacial modifier show a
higher extent of cure than the TESPT-containing system at a fixed
proportion of silica loading, exhibiting the improvement of filler–rubber
interaction in NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites.

SEM Failure Surface Morphology
The homogeneity of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites was examined by the scanning electron microscopy
analyses of the tensile fractured surface of their vulcanizates. Furthermore,
for comparison, other control samples with fresh NR and silica composites
are examined. Those images are presented in Figure 2a–c. From Figure 2a, it is observed that the devulcanized sample
shows homogeneous and uniform dispersion of silica, and a very fine
structure of the silica particles can be obtained at the submicron
length scale. However, a few bigger agglomerated structures can also
be noticed. In the case of fresh NR silica composites (Figure 2b), the fractured surface is
found to be smooth with some bigger aggregated particles embedded
on top of the surface. After the addition of silane (Figure 2c) to the fresh rubber compounds,
the particles are found to be coated by a thin layer of rubber. This
finding is associated with the coupling activity of the silane used
in the compounds.

fresh NR and without silane, and (c) Silica-30 with fresh NR and silane.

Equilibrium Swelling Measurements
The rubber–filler
interaction of the composites is studied through equilibrium swelling
measurement. The volume fraction (Vrf)
of the rubber in swollen composites with silica loading as shown in Figure 3a indicates that
with the increase in silica loading, the solvent uptake of the composite
decreased, resulting in an increase in volume fraction. Moreover,
at a particular concentration of the silica loading (30 phr), the
highest rubber–filler interaction is attained for the Silica-30
composite containing DeVulcNR, followed by Silica-30 (control-TESPT)
and then Silica-30 (control). The stronger rubber–filler interaction
between silica and DeVulcNR can be explained by the formation of chemical
linkages between the pendent ethoxy ( – OC2H5) groups of DeVulcNR with the silanol ( – OH) groups
of silica. The reinforcing efficiency of the filler is also determined
from the Kraus equation55 in which a plot
of  versus  should give
a straight line. The slope
of the straight line could be a measure of the reinforcing capability
of the filler. The higher the reinforcing capability of the filler,
the higher will be the swelling resistance of the composite because
of the presence of filler. The plot of the Kraus equation of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites with different proportions of silica loading is
shown in Figure 3b.
The negative slope of the straight line indicates the reinforcement
of the composite. The plot of  versus e–z from the Cunneen and
Russell relation provides a straight
line with a positive slope construed as a measure of the reinforcement
behavior of the composites by the filler. The plot of the Cunneen
and Russell equation is shown in Figure 3c. The high value of “a” and low value of “b” indicate
the rubber–filler attachment, and  < 1 shows reinforcement. Therefore,
the Kraus and Cunneen and Russell plots indicate the reinforcement
of SiO2 in the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites.
Furthermore, the increase in the network density with filler contents
as evident from Figure 3d may be due to the formation of network structure to the filler
surface and subsequently increases the filler–rubber interaction.

The XRD patterns of SiO2, Silica-30, and Silica-30 (control)
are presented in Figure 4. The broad peak of silica at 2θ of 23.2o characterizes
the noncrystalline structure of silica. Although, in the present case,
amorphous precipitated silica is used, some crystals of silica can
be present as impurities. Nevertheless, the peak of silica in the
Silica-30 (control) composite appears exactly in the same 2θ
at 23.2o, whereas in the Silica-30 composite with DeVulcNR,
the peak shifts from 23.2 to 20.6o, which indicates the
chemical interaction between SiO2 and DeVulcNR of the composite
on the interface.43 When silica is added
with NR/DeVulcNR, its amorphous structure would change arising out
of the chemical bond formation and hydrogen bond interaction58,59 between Si – OH and pendent ethoxy group ( – OEt)
of DeVulcNR so that shifting of the diffraction peak of SiO2 takes place.

NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2.

FTIR Analysis
FTIR analysis is carried out to see the
formation of pendent ethoxy-functionalized DeVulcNR and its subsequent
reinforcement with silica in the composite. The FTIR spectra of TESPT
and DeVulcNR are shown in Figure 5a. The characteristic peaks of TESPT appear at 1164
cm–1 (Si–O cage-like stretching mode), 1070
and 956 cm–1 (Si–O stretching), and 1243
cm–1 (symmetric Si–C–H bending). The
absorption peaks at 1164 cm–1 for the Si–O
cage-like stretching mode, 1079 and 963 cm–1 for
Si–O stretching, and 1243 cm–1 for symmetric
Si–C–H bending also appear in DeVulcNR indicating the
presence of fragmented TESPT in DeVulcNR. To gather an idea about
the silica reinforcement mechanism of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites,
FTIR spectra of SiO2, NR/SiO2, NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2, and NR/SiO2/TESPT are shown in Figure 5b. The broad peak at 3442 cm–1 corresponds to −OH stretching of Si–OH,
and another peak at 1099 cm–1 is attributed to Si–O–Si
stretching in silica, whereas −OH stretching appears at 3344
cm–1 and Si–O–Si stretching appears
at 1083 cm–1 in NR/SiO2. However, no
such peak of −OH stretching appears in NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 and NR/SiO2/TESPT composites, and only the characteristic
peak at 1074 cm–1 appears because Si–O–Si
stretching emerges.

Figure 5 (a) FTIR spectra of TESPT and DeVulcNR; (b) FTIR spectra
of SiO2, NR/SiO2, NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2, and NR/SiO2/TESPT.

Thus, it is apparent that the silica reinforcement of the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composite occurs due to the formation of −Si–O–Si–
linkages through chemical reaction between silanol groups present
in the silica surface and the pendent ethoxy group of the DeVulcNR
or TESPT, as shown in Scheme 1. Moreover, both the DeVulcNR- and TESPT-containing NR/SiO2 composites show a C–H stretching vibration of −CH2– groups in the rubber backbone at 2911 and 2843 cm–1.

Mechanical Properties
The enhanced rubber–filler
interaction along with improved dispersion of silica in the NR/DeVulcNR
compound has a considerable influence on the mechanical performance
of the composite. The stress–strain behavior of the different
composites is shown in Figure 6a. The stress–strain curve distinctly exhibits that
the moduli at different % elongation increase with the silica loading
in the case of the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composite. However,
the respective values are much inferior for the NR/SiO2 composite, but the values for Silica-30 and Silica-30 (control-TESPT)
are almost comparable. From the Figure 6b, it can be noticed that in the case of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates, stress at 100 and 200% elongation increases
with the increase in silica loading up to formulation Silica-40. Tensile
strength also enhances with the increase in silica loading up to 30
phr, but with a further increase in silica loading (40 phr), the tensile
strength slightly decreases, as presented in Figure 6c.

Figure 6 (a) Stress–strain behavior of different
silica–rubber
composites. Effect of (b) stress at 50 and 100% elongation. (c) Tensile
strength and elongation at break. (d) Tear strength and abrasion loss
with silica content in the composite.

This is due to the fact that with a greater proportion of silica
loading, the vulcanizates become stiff and inhibit the stress transmission.
The increase in tensile strength of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites
as compared to the NR/SiO2 composites clearly indicates
the reinforcement of silica filler in which DeVulcNR acts as an interfacial
modifier. The pendent ethoxy group present in DeVulcNR eases the dispersion
of silica filler through the chemical reaction with the silanol groups
present in the silica surface and it shows superior rubber–filler
interaction rather than filler–filler interaction. The very
high elongation at break of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates
is due to the superior interfacial interaction between silica and
rubber. Moreover, the elongation at break (Figure 6c) also increased with a silica loading up
to 30 phr, which indicates better chain mobility due to silica reinforcement.
However, the further increase in silica loading due to agglomeration
of silica results in the vulcanizates becoming stiff. Therefore, the
chain mobility as well as the elongation at break decreases. To compare
the effectiveness of DeVulcNR as a compatibilizer, NR/SiO2 vulcanizate is prepared in the presence of TESPT, a universally
used coupling agent for silica–filler dispersion into the nonpolar
rubber compound. The results indicate that the performances of the
Silica-30 composite are comparable with those of the Silica-30 (control-TESPT)
composite.

The tear strength and abrasion resistance of the
NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates at different silica loadings
and NR/SiO2 vulcanizates both in the presence and absence
of TESPT are
evaluated and presented in Figure 6d. From Figure 6d, it is apparent that the tear strength increases with the
increase in silica loading, and the maximum value of the tear strength
is achieved for a 40 phr silica loading. The results also indicate
that the tear strength of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates
is much superior to that of the Silica-30 (control-TESPT) vulcanizates.
The abrasion loss presented in Figure 6d also decreases with the silica loading, and the lowest
value of abrasion loss is achieved for 30 phr. The superior abrasion
loss is obtained for the Silica-30 composite as compared to the Silica-30
(control-TESPT) composite.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis
The
DSC thermograms of the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 blend vulcanizates
at various silica loadings and NR/SiO2 vulcanizates both
with and without TESPT are presented in Figure 7. A single glass transition for all the vulcanizates
is found in between −57.4 and −54.8 °C. The glass
transition temperature and change in the heat capacity and transition
width are evaluated from the DSC thermograms and shown in Table 2. The silica content
in the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizates as well as NR/SiO2 vulcanizates both with and without TESPT do not show any
significant effect on the glass transition temperature (Tg). The heat capacity increment (ΔCp) decreases with increasing silica loading. Since ΔCp is a change in heat capacity of the polymer
that participates in glass transition, the decrease in ΔCp is often studied in terms of an immobilized
layer of polymer surrounded with filler particles/crystallites. The
fraction of immobilized polymer chain can then be calculated by 5  where ΔCp0 is the change
of the heat capacity of the pure rubber and WSiO2 is the weight fraction of silica, and the values
of χim are shown in Table 2. In the case of the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 vulcanizate, the χim value increases with
the silica loading. With the increase in silica content, the polymer
filler interaction, that is, the reinforcing ability of the vulcanizates
increases and so the fraction of immobilized polymer chains increases
as well. In the case of the NR/SiO2 vulcanizates without
the coupling agent, the heat capacity increment (ΔCp) value is much superior compared to that of the others,
and consequently, the lowest χim value is obtained,
which indicates inferior polymer–filler interaction.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
Dynamic mechanical
analysis of all the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites is studied
to have an idea about the silica reinforcement. The temperature dependence
of storage modulus (E′) and loss
factor (tan δ) of the composites with different silica contents
are illustrated in Figure 8a,b and respective data are presented in Table 3.

Figure 8 (a) Storage modulus and
(b) loss tangent ( tan δ) of different
rubber–SiO2 composites as a function of temperature.

Silica-10	2.62	1.54	231.4	
Silica-20	5.81	1.21	231.3

Silica-40	33.42	0.69	230.4	
Silica-30 (control)	7.24	1.17	232.8	
Silica-30 (control-TESPT)	12.26	1.17	230.8	
The storage modulus of the composites can be considered
as a direct
measure of the filler reinforcement. It is also found to depend on
the filler dispersion, rubber–filler interaction, and ultimately
the compatibility of the blend.60,61 As illustrated in Figure 8a and Table 3, it is revealed that the E′ values of NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites consistently increase with the silica loading, and the
highest value is achieved for the 40 phr silica loading. To get an
idea about the ability of DeVulcNR as a compatibilizer in NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites, the E′ values
of Silica-30 are compared with those of the Silica-30 (control) and
Silica-30 (control-TESPT) composites. The result indicates that in
the case of Silica-30 (control) vulcanizates, the room temperature E′ is much poorer due to the incompatibility
between the rubber and filler and high filler–filler interaction.
The respective value of Silica-30 (control-TESPT) vulcanizates is
much higher than that of Silica-30 (control) vulcanizates due to the
presence of the coupling agent TESPT that enhances the compatibility
between NR and silica and simultaneously increases the rubber–filler
interaction. However, the E′ value
of Silica-30 (control-TESPT) is almost comparable with that of the
Silica-30 due to strong rubber–filler interaction, which is
facilitated through the chemical reaction between the pendent ethoxy
of DeVulcNR and the hydroxyl group of silica.

The temperature
dependence curve (Figure 8b) of the loss factor ( tan δ) indicates
that the position of the maximum value of loss tangent ( tan δmax) is not considerably influenced by the silica loading.
All the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites show the glass transition
(Tg) in the narrow temperature range from
230 to 233 K, but the highest tan δ at Tg decreases with silica loading in the NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composite. This could be due to the increasing silica loading,
which enhances rubber–filler interaction and consequently hinders
the mobility of the rubber chain leading to a rise in E′ and fall in the tan δ value and decreases
the viscoelasticity of the material as well.62 The SiO2–DeVulcNR bonds created during vulcanization improve the rubber–filler
interaction.

Conclusions
DeVulcNR prepared by
mechanochemical devulcanization of vulcanized
NR using bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide is used as an interfacial
modifier for NR/DeVulcNR/SiO2 composites. The improvement
in the extent of cure, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical properties
of NR/SiO2 composites in the presence of DeVulcNR can be
due to the interaction between the pendent ethoxy functional groups
of DeVulcNR and the hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. It can
ameliorate the dispersion of silica in the rubber matrix and increase
the interfacial interaction between silica and rubber. The silica–rubber
interfacial interaction is supported by the XRD analysis, which indicates
that the peak shifts from 23.2o in Silica-30 (control)
to 20.6o in Silica-30. The FTIR analysis shows the disappearance
of −OH stretching of Si–OH at 3344 cm–1 in Silica-30, which further proves the chemical interaction between
silanol groups on the silica surface and ethoxy groups on DeVulcNR.
The SEM analysis of Silica-30 shows uniform dispersion of silica at
the submicron length scale, whereas in Silica-30 (control), bigger
agglomerates appear on top of the surface. The tensile strength and
elongation at break of the Silica-30 composite are 20.13 MPa and 921%,
respectively, whereas the respective values are 5.61 MPa and 539%
respectively. The assessment of the immobilized polymer fraction chains
by DSC study shows that with the increase in silica loading, fraction
of immobilized polymer chains decreases. The efficiency of DeVulcNR
as interfacial modifier in the Silica-30 composites is compared with
TESPT, a conventional coupling agent of silica in the Silica-30 (control-TESPT)
composites. The properties of both the composites are comparable but
greatly superior as compared to Silica-30 (control) composites.
