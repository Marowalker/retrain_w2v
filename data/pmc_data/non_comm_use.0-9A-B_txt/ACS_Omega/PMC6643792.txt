Here,
for the first time, we investigated the effects of matrixes
with different nature on the stimuli-responsive mechanoluminescence
(ML) of incorporated nanoparticles. It turned out that the contraction
forces initiated by polymerization process can have compressive effects
that differ by orders. This effect was achieved owing to the introduction
of ML crystals in an alumina sol–gel system, which has large
surface of coagulation contact. As one particle of boehmite results
in a tension of 10–17–10–16 N per one particle of matrix, compared to 10–19 N of PDMS matrix, the threshold of mechanoluminescence was
reached at 0.04 Pa, whereas the most active materials to date did
not exceed this value. Thus, this material can be a perspective for
the production of impact detectors, photonic displays of the next
generation, and other advanced devices.

Introduction
Nowadays, the steady trend to transition
from electronic elemental
base and electric systems to photonic ones is seen. The new direction
of research—photonics—has a huge amount of achievements,
which are used increasingly during the development of information-measuring
systems of new generation, so the interest in sensor elements or photon-induced
materials based on ML properties increases.1,2 Because
the feature of as-mentioned sensor elements is a direct transformation
of mechanical action into an optical signal, these can be integrated
in fiber-optic information-measuring systems and networks. Sensor
elements may be applied in common with devices of integral and fiber
optics,3 impact detectors,4,5 registration and monitoring systems of impulse mechanical loads
and vibrations,4,6 and production of sensor photonic
displays of new generation.7 Furthermore,
application of these elements in optical memory cells is highly perspective.8 Mechatronic networks based on mechanoluminescent
sensor elements and fiber-optic data transmission lines are insensitive
to external electromagnetic interference, which provides automatically
galvanic isolation. The use of amplitude–time parameters of
optical signal, its spatial modulation, spectrum (color), and polarization
state raises the informativity of transmitted signal. In this case,
both investigation of known ML materials, which are rather effective
in the transformation of mechanical action into optical signal, and
the search for new ones become especially actual. A large number of
chemical compounds are famous for their mechanoluminescence (ML).9 Despite the common name, ML mechanism varies
in different groups of composites, which is important for further
mechanoluminophore application in device engineering. At the moment,
ML mechanisms of several groups of compounds, such as metals and quartz,10,11 semiconductors doped with d metals in the form A(II)B(VI),12 and composites MAl2O4 (M
= Sr or Ba) doped with rare-earth elements,13 are relatively well studied. The recent reviews14,15 reported and summarized the information about ML materials and described
further applications of composites (bioapplications are also present16,17) and some perspectives of this field of science.

However,
it is now hard to achieve light emission because strong
mechanical action is required for an ML effect. In this work, we examine
the influence of an alumina sol–gel matrix on mechanoluminescence
and compare its effect with an Si-organic matrix. The investigation
was carried out with use of SrAl2O4:(Eu2+,Dy3+) nanocrystals.

ML process in a group
of chemical composites MAl2O4 (M = Sr or Ba)
doped with rare-earth elements (i.e., europium
and dysprosium) is the result of a multistage mechanism,18 as seen in Figure 1a and shown as the original mechanism by
Matsuzawa et al.19 However, this raises
doubts and is rarely used by this day. The model of the process described
by Dorenbos et al. is stated to be more suitable.20 In this case, electrons that are excited from Eu2+ are released to the 5d level and then to the conduction band, which
is situated close to the 5d level. Next, these are caught by Dy2+ ions. Then, when pressure is applied, recombination takes
place, which results in light emission (Figure 1b).

Matsuzawa et al.,
where 1 is Eu2+, 2 is Eu+, 3 is the dot, 4 is
Dy4+, 5 is Dy3+, and 6 is the quantum of light.
(b) Band model of recombination processes in a crystal of SrAl2O4:(Eu2+,Dy3+) by Dorenbos
et al.

Organic (PVC) or inorganic (silica)
substrates may be used as matrices
of mechanoluminescent crystals.18 The highest
emission was reached owing to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrices.7 However, a soft PDMS matrix absorbs the basic
load and transmits enough amount of energy to tribocrystals only under
conditions of significantly high tension. The general advantage of
alumina matrix is its ability to demonstrate contraction. While the
gel is desiccated, recombination of matrix particles happens, which
results in its compression. This provides an additional load to ML
crystals, which are included in the matrix, so the required value
of force for the activation of ML effect decreases.

It is known
that the state of the luminescent material and its
photon emission can be significantly influenced by the matrix, which
contains a luminescent substance, or by a solvent with this material.21 The purpose of the study is to investigate the
influence of different transparent matrices on ML properties inhibition
of Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 nanoparticles, followed by the possibility of coating
creation, which is able to induce photon emission in the visible spectral
region under an action of extremely low loads.

Results and Discussion
Contraction
Phenomenon in the Composites
The effect
of contraction forces, which emerges during condensation of colloidal
inorganic systems, is found to exert a favorable action on mechanoluminescence.
The most interesting example of this effect is the observed consequence
of transition of the crust from the liquid to the solid state,
which is supported by the generation of a developed rough surface
that is mountains (Figure 2d). Tangential forces of compression originating from these
formations are highly valuable, because crustal folding, oscillatory
motion, magma rising, and discontinuous dislocations are produced.
The translation of analogous processes to micro- and nanoscale processes
leads to the same effects. For instance, drying of hydrogels, regardless
of their characteristics, is connected to a drop in surface tension
of intermicellar liquid. It is obvious that if the surface tension
of intermicellar liquid falls, then capillary contraction forces,
which thicken a structure of a solid body, will decrease. Sol–gel
transition, such as the formation of a hard xerogel with inorganic
network compaction, depicts the most successful example of this phenomenon.
At the same time, the instances of liquid-phase hardening, when a
compressing action on damped objects is absent, are known. One example
of these is the production of amber, which is a high-molecular-weight
compound of organic acids (Figure 2b). Consequently, it is possible to assume that the
mechanisms of contraction force action in organic and inorganic polymers
are principally different. According to the SEM data in Figure 2a,c, the same effects are observed
at the studied systems. Namely, Figure 2c demonstrates strontium aluminate formations, which
stand out on the surface of boehmite xerogel. These were obtained
during the polycondensation process and drying of the xerogel. On
the other hand, the organosilicon matrix does not show the effect
that is identical to the classical behavior of organic polymers (Figure 2a). The comparison
involved allows the determination of the influence of matrices on
the processes of quenching and amplification of mechanoluminescence
of encapsulated objects.

provided by tangential forces of compression during hardening of the
crust.

XRD Data
The XRD
pattern of Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 phosphor samples
is depicted in Figure 3 as the gray graph. It is shown that the diffraction peaks match
well with the 90 JCPDS card no. 74-0794, indicating that the pure
monoclinic crystal structure with space group P2
is obtained. Co-doping with Eu2+ and Dy3+ does
not cause any significant change in the host structure. Diffractograms
of composite materials based on alumina and PDMS matrices, which were
obtained in the presence of Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 nanoparticles, prove the preservation
of strontium aluminate structures (characteristic peaks of strontium
aluminate present on both composites). Moreover, the structure of
matrices also persists in composites. The only difference is the appearance
of a wide peak in the alumina composite (left graph, wide peak at
20°) due to the presence of polyvinyl alcohol as a stabilizer
in this system.

Influence of Solvent on
Phosphorescence
As MO·xAl2O3 doped with rare-earth elements
are usually produced by the ceramic method, it was comfortable to
employ the ball mill to obtain the acceptable fine powder of strontium
aluminate doped with Eu and Dy. This methodology partially destroys
the crystal structure of powders and increases their reactivity. As
soon as the ground powder is in contact with water, the hydrolysis
reaction looks like  

Hydrolysis products include aluminum
hydroxide and are soluble in water strontium hydroxide, which lowers
the pH of the medium after dissolution of the powder. During hydrolysis,
phosphorescence of the powder is assumed to degenerate, whereas the
crystal structure of luminophores decays. Polyvinyl alcohol played
the role of a modifying additive in this work to avoid the abovementioned
effect, since it prevented direct contact with water molecules because
of competitive physisorption from the solution, stabilized the formed
coatings, and declined their fragility. Figure 4 depicts the dynamics of phosphorescence
change in Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 entrapped in the alumina matrix during the drying
process. It is shown that primary emission persists after drying.
The graphs of excitation of the green-blue region at wavelengths from
400 to 480 nm and intensity of photoluminescence (PL), which were
measured before drying, are displayed in Figure 4a,b, respectively. It is found that PL has
two peaks at excitation wavelengths of 400 and 440 nm (the material
glows in interval between blue and green regions). Upon drying, the
photoluminescence of the composite shifted mostly from blue to green
regions (Figure 4c,d).
The curves depicted by solid lines fromFigure 4c correspond to two states of phosphorescence,
where the left line is photoluminescence before drying, the right
line is photoluminescence after drying, and the intermediate lines
are photoluminescence during drying. In our previous work,22 it was demonstrated that water is removed upon
drying of the alumina gel, which results in this shift.

green-blue region excited at different wavelengths.

from green and blue spectral regions, where PL lines from intermediate
regions are situated between these two borders, which are illustrated
in (d).

Influence of the Matrix
on Quenching of Phosphorescence
Thermal quenching of crystallophore
phosphorescence is connected
not only with the impact of heating on a glowing center but also with
the appearance of the new process—the filling of excited electron-free
centers by electrons rising from the valence band, which is influenced
by thermal energy. The resulting neutralized emissive centers can
no longer play a role in further recombination processes. The dots,
which were formed as a result of escape of electrons, move through
the valence band, meet the centers of quenching, and localize to these.
For the sustainable localization, it is necessary that the levels
of quenching centers situated up on the valence band were noticeably
higher than the levels of the glow centers. In this position of the
quenching levels, electrons from the valence band cannot rise to the
localized dots by the thermal path. The dots recombine with electrons
from the conduction band. However, recombination close to the quenching
center does not glow. Although it is taken from the point of view
that PDMS and alumina matrices have principal differences at their
thermal conductivity properties (Table 1), it becomes clear that the activation of these processes
proceeds in different ways. As shown in the obtained data (Figure 5a), the mechanism
of phosphorescence quenching in the boehmite matrix has the character
of a pseudo-first-order kinetic model, whereas the PDMS matrix has
a zero-order character. Most likely, this is connected with the appearance
of diffusion heat transfer processes in matrices, because their heat-conducting
properties are different essentially, as depicted in Table 1. It is clearly seen in Figure 5b that the introduction
of ML particles in matrices does not have an essential influence on
phosphorescence lifetime: the form of graphs and lifetime values of
composites are close to the original.

active centers. The measurements were carried out in a ditch quartz
cell by an Agilent Cary Eclipse fluorometer with ±0.05 °C
precision and an excitation wavelength of 440 nm.

Dependence of Contraction Forces on the Nature of the Matrix
The development from the sol–gel state of boehmite to xerogel
is a multistage process, which contains both ion-exchange process
and drying. The bonds recombine, and the volume decreases in the alumina
matrix upon drying because of solvent removal. Hence, the matrix compresses
and squeezes the phase entrapped in it. The setup was constructed
for the detection of the value of these forces (Figure 12), which is described in Experimental Details. The dependence of compressing
action in time in the boehmite gel, which was measured during the
drying process, versus cross-linking of the PDMS matrix is depicted
in Figure 6 (left).

Figure 6 Dependence
of the compression forces on time during the process
of drying of the initial matrices based on boehmite and PDMS in bulk
(left) and per one particle of matrix (right).

As illustrated in the left graph of Figure 6, the forces of capillary contraction thicken
the structure of the alumina matrix during the drying process (stage
I), followed by the convergence of its elements and providing the
possibility of the appearance of numerous secondary cohesive and adhesive
strengthening bonds (stage II) over the growth of coagulation contact
between particles when dried. The intensity of those forces rises
during drying and reaches the maximum at the border of conversion
gel–xerogel. The last step of viscosity increase is characterized
by total liquid removal, so that the forces of capillary contraction
gradually disappear (stage III). For the PDMS matrix, those phenomena
were not observed, which is assumed to take place because of independent
effects from the stage of drying and density fluctuations of particle
coagulation contact.

Macroscopic measurements of compression
described above are equitable
for volume V = 0.3 mL of both composites before drying.
The compression of alumina (average diameter of particle is 15 nm)
and PDMS (average molecular weight is 27,000, repeating unit molecular
weight of 207.4 g/mol) per one particle of matrix was calculated to
estimate the contraction forces. The assumptions of further calculations
are as follows: (1) the compression force is evenly distributed throughout
all units of the matrix 1  where F is
the compression force of the matrix, F0 is the force per one unit (particle of alumina or PDMS molecule),
and N is the amount of units in the volume V; (2) boehmite forms spherical nanoparticles with radius r = 7.5 nm, and its volume (Vp) is 2  Thus, F0 can be found as 3  For PDMS, one particle is
considered as one molecule (Vp = Vmol), so the second fraction in eq 3 transforms to 1. The results of
calculations are shown in Figure 6 (right graph).

The stress of one particle of
alumina in N is
stated to be higher by two orders than the stress of one PDMS molecule.
Consequently, the inorganic matrix should activate triboluminescence
more intensively and suppress the absorption of mechanical load. Taking
into account the value of operating forces on the model nanoparticle
after entrapment in the alumina matrix, morphological transformation
of trapped strontium aluminate nanoparticles was discovered. It is
expected that this transformation is the edge dislocation of crystalline
layers relative to each other. The determination of composition of
eluated formations by the EDX mapping method (Figure 7) proves this conclusion. According to the
data obtained, outgrowths with a similar composition to strontium
aluminate form on the surface of alumina xerogel during the drying
process. Their presence is explained by partial hydrolysis of trapped
strontium aluminate particles and by the action of capillary contraction
forces on these objects during the drying process. In this way, the
consequence about the possibility of an excessive compressive load
on the trapped objects in sol–gel systems over this process
is established.

matrix

of ion beam treatment. (b) Increased view from the top of the internal
composition of the zone treated with an ion beam.

The viscometry graphs of alumina and PDMS matrices are displayed
in Figure 8a. Alumina
gelates over 5 min, whereas PDMS cures for 10 min. This demonstrates
that these materials harden fast enough to cause production, as soon
as its cycle gives the required time for convenient processing.

Figure 8 (a) Growth
of alumina and PDMS viscosity in time under conditions
of the absence of mechanical action. (b) ML peak intensity versus
external mechanical load.

Fluctuations of luminescence intensity depending on applied
load
were measured to acknowledge the aforementioned information. The change
in emission intensity due to mechanical tension (triboluminescence)
is shown in Figure 8b. According to the data obtained, the activation thresholds of triboluminescence
for Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 entrapped in matrices with various chemical nature
are significantly different. This proves the conclusions about the
presence of residual tension in the system and the residual action
of compression forces in inorganic sol–gel matrices contrary
to organic ones. For instance, the activation threshold of triboluminescence
for the PDMS matrix is 0.21 Pa, whereas that for the alumina matrix
is only 0.04 Pa. It is obvious that the use of inorganic matrices,
which condense with compaction of their skeleton, has a positive effect
on the excitation of triboluminescence of the captured agent. Particularly,
this may be applied as photon-induced coatings, which activate by
applying pressure using a human finger (Figure 9).

of finger pressure.

One more perspective form of the application of highly sensitive
ML composite is the advanced glowing detector on a product package.
Namely, if some products, such as dairy and meat products, are spoiled,
excess gas medium will generate inside a package with this product.
Obviously, gas generation is a result of the vital activity of bacteria,
and it is dangerous to consume such products. The additional pressure
of this gas results in mechanical deformation of a package (swelling).
Thus, because an alumina ML material is very active, we assumed that
a triboluminescent label added on the cover of a fermented milk product
can serve as the visual detector of its freshness (Figure 10).

Figure 10 ML detector of a swollen
package. Appearance of (a) the package
with an ML indicator, (b) the package in a dark room, (c) the package
before the expiration date excited by UV light (any tension affects
the cover, so the ML label dimly glows because of excitation), and
(d) the package after the expiration date excited by UV light (the
ML label underwent mechanical load and began to glow brightly).

Figure 11 Schematic image of obtaining the phosphorescent
layer from the
transparent solution employing the molding method.

First, a package with an ML indicator was exposed
to UV irradiation
to activate tribocrystals inside the composite material. In the case
of a product before its expiration date, a very dim glow was observed
(Figure 10c), because
any pressure influenced the label. On the other hand, a package swelled
after the expiration date and pressurized the cover with an ML composite,
so it glowed rather brightly. The experiment proves that the alumina-based
triboluminescent material can help discourage customers from buying
spoiled products due to visibility and impossibility to hide the fact
of spoilage.

Conclusions
Overall, this investigation
reports how matrices with different
nature have an influence on the mechanoluminescent and morphological
properties of corresponding composite materials, which consist of
Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 dispersed in a matrix. The alumina xerogel and PDMS were
chosen as inorganic and polymer matrices, respectively. As a result,
the threshold of triboluminescence activation of the alumina composite
was seen to require a rather weak external tension because of internal
contraction phenomenon of the matrix, which takes place during the
drying process. Because this phenomenon is absent in polymer compounds
and these matrices absorb external tension, the boehmite triboluminescent
material activates at load, which is lower by two orders, than the
PDMS composite (0.04 Pa vs 0.21 Pa). Finally, authors expect that
inorganic matrices will expand their application in mechanoluminescent
devices, such as impact detectors or photonic displays, because most
of the developed materials do not exceed their properties.

Experimental
Details
Chemicals
Aluminum isopropoxide (98%, Aldrich), strontium
aluminate (europium- and dysprosium-doped, Aldrich), polyvinyl alcohol
(PVA) (Mw ≈ 31,000, Mowiol 4-88,
Aldrich), Sylgard 184 (Aldrich), and nitric acid (65%, ACROS Organics)
were used.

Alumina Sol Synthesis
The technique
described in ref (27) was employed to synthesize
the sol–gel boehmite matrix. Aluminum isopropoxide (8.2 g)
was added to 50 mL of distilled water, which was heated to 90 °C.
This step resulted in immediate formation of a white precipitate.
After that, the obtained mixture was thoroughly stirred for 15 min
at 90 °C. Thus, the formation of boehmite nanoparticles was stopped,
and isopropanol, which was collected because of hydrolysis, was evaporated.
Finally, 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid was poured into the mixture
and cooled down to room temperature under continuous stirring.

PDMS Synthesis
The matrix based on PDMS was produced
from Sylgard 184, which contains two parts: a polymer and a cross-linker.
First, these parts were mixed at a weight ratio of 10:1 (base/curing
agent). Then, the mixture was put in a vacuum oven to remove air bubbles
and stop them from forming. After that, this matrix was applied to
produce composites.

Preparation of ML Samples
The Sr0.95Eu0.02Dy0.03Al2O4 powder was
shredded preliminarily by a ball mill (0.03 g) up to 100 nm average
diameter and immersed in concentrated boehmite sol (1 mL) with polyvinyl
alcohol as a stabilizer (2 mL of 4% aqueous solution) or mixed with
PDMS matrix (3 mL). Thus, the concentration of SrAl2O4:(Eu, Dy) in solutions was 4.78 × 10–5 mol/mL. These mixtures were stirred thoroughly and left in air until
complete drying and curing. The scheme of the process involved is
shown in Figure 11. Thus, both thin films were obtained, which covered flexible substrates
and individual thin films with low mechanical strength.

laser; (b) scheme of the occurrence of contraction; (c) model of the

Characterization
A Tescan Vega3 electron microscope
was employed for surface scanning of the created composites. X-ray
structural analysis was made by a Bruker D8 Advance apparatus using
Cu K radiation (λ = 1.54 Å); scanning was conducted at
2θ at a speed of 0.5° per minute. Measurements by dynamic
light scattering were implemented by means of a Photocor Compact-Z
analyzer at 25 °C. pH level was regulated by 0.1 M HCl or 0.1
M NaOH. Fluorescence emission spectra and spectra of excitation of
colloidal solutions were measured through water. Thermal quenching
of phosphorescence was measured in a ditch quartz cell by an Agilent
Cary Eclipse fluorometer with ±0.05 °C precision. Viscosity
gain of the alumina matrix was measured by a Fungilab Expert Series
viscometer. Mechanoluminescence was detected by an Ocean Optics Flame
spectrometer (Figure 12a). The tripod UV laser (power, <300
mW; λ = 375 nm) focused through a quartz window was fixed on
the contact point of the examined sample and a texturometer was traversed
to the sample, so that induced mechanoluminescence is present at the
load point. Next, the texturometer traversed down to the sample while
making the tension required for fast initiation of mechanoluminescence
at the load point (Figure 12c). Meanwhile, luminescence intensity changes were detected
by a Flame-S-UV-Vis spectrometer (Ocean Optics) and were transmitted
to the computer. Thus, the dependence of luminescence intensity on
the degree of loading was recorded. Contraction forces were measured
by an Instron 5943 strain gauge machine. The model of the experiment
is shown in Figure 12b. The alumina or PDMS matrix (0.3 mL) was set between two planar
surfaces made of nickel polished plates (diameter = 1.5 cm), which
were fixed in a strain gauge machine, at a distance of 1 mm (Figure 12d). After that,
registration of contraction forces occurred, which are conditioned
by compression of the matrix during condensation process and air drying.
