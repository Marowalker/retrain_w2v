Long-term preservation of the properties
of gold nanoparticles
in both solution and the dry powder form can be difficult. We have
overcome this challenge by using organotellurium derivatives as both
reducing agents and stabilizers in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.
This new synthetic protocol takes advantage of the photochemical and
oxidative properties of diphenyl ditelluride (Ph2Te2), which, so far, have never been exploited in the synthesis
of gold nanoparticles. The Au/Te core/shell (inorganic/organic) hybrid
nanomaterial can be obtained in a one-step reaction, using only Ph2Te2 and HAuCl4. By modifying the reaction
conditions, different resonance conditions of the gold core are achieved
due to the formation of external shells with different thicknesses.
The organotellurium shell can be easily removed by resuspension of
the nanoparticles in environmentally friendly solvents, such as water
or ethanol, making the Au core available for subsequent applications.
A mechanism for the formation of core/shell nanoparticles has also
been discussed.

1 Introduction
Gold
nanomaterials have emerged as an exceptional tool, with innumerable
applications in different scientific areas, such as catalysis,1,2 chemical sensing,3,4 biochemistry,5,6 and
nanomedicine.7,8 Since the first Faraday’s
report on gold colloidal synthesis,9 considerable
effort has been made to discover new synthetic routes, which allow
the design of nanomaterials with specific properties. Specifically,
gold core@shell nanomaterials present the characteristics and unusual
optoelectronic properties of a noble-metal core and the physical and
chemical properties of an external shell. The shell influences the
properties of the core, such as its optical resonance, chemical reactivity,
and long-term stability. Furthermore, the shell
allows the transformation of the colloidal system in a solid material
via a drying dispersing phase, while maintaining the core’s
optical properties during the process.10 Silicates11 or metals12 are the most commonly reported outer-shell-based materials.
Soft-chemical removal of such a shell, while maintaining the properties
of the metal core, is extremely difficult. To overcome this problem,
strategies entailing the use of polymers to make modular outer shells
have emerged.13 The properties of the core
can be modulated through functionalization with different ligands.
However, replacement of the ligands used as stabilizers can be difficult;
thus, applications of the core are limited by the possibility of replacing
one type of stabilizer ligand with another. New strategies intended
to facilitate the functionalization of presynthesized gold nanoparticles
have been recently reported.14

Tellurium
presents an extraordinary ability to act as a Lewis acid
or base, having a wide range of oxidation states (−2, 0, +2,
+4, +6).15 In addition, according to Pearson
acid/base theory, selenium or tellurium, when compared with sulfur,
shows an increased affinity toward soft metal cations, such as Au(III).
Quantum calculations have demonstrated that the application of this
type of chalcogen could increase the conductance between the gold
metal core and the stabilizer molecule.16 Despite being promising candidates, little experimental work has
been reported to date on the use of selenium and tellurium as stabilizers;17−23 this can be linked to the difficulty in handling selenium and tellurium
organic compounds, which are often sensitive to oxygen and light.
Tellurium has been used as a reducing agent for a variety of organic
substrates.24 Less attention has been paid
to its use as a reducing agent for metal cations, although spontaneous
reduction of Au(III) to Au(I)20,21 or Au(0)25 by different tellurium derivatives has been
reported. The production of olygomeric structures by aggregation/condensation
of tellurinic acids, [PhTeOOH]n, or anhydrides,
[PhTeO]n, through oxidative and hydrolysis
reactions26,27 or by photodecomposition of Te–Te
derivatives in coordinating solvent28 has
been reported in the literature. Depolymerization of these species
can occur in the presence of nucleophilic substances, like NaOH.29

Herein, we describe the use of organotellurium
derivatives as both
reducing agents and stabilizers in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.
This new synthetic pathway takes advantage of the tellurium properties
described above, and this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
report on the application of organotellurium derivatives in this manner.
A highly stable colloidal solution with an Au core and an organotellurium
shell is obtained in a single step. The nanoparticles are soluble
in several common solvents and can be dried to obtain a solid-state
material, while preserving the intrinsic properties of the gold core.
In addition, the external organotellurium shell can be removed by
resuspension in ethanol, methanol, or water, which produces a “naked”
gold nanoparticle that is ready for subsequent applications. As a
proof of concept, we have used the nanoparticles in two common applications,
namely, as nanoprecursors for more complex nanomaterial synthesis
and as a potential tool in proteomics applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Au–Te
Nanoparticles: Influence
of the Reaction Conditions
Hybrid nanoparticles with an Au core and organic Te shell (Au–Te)
were prepared in a single step, using HAuCl4·3H2O and Ph2Te2 as precursors in a 1:3
ratio. Acetonitrile was chosen as the solvent for the synthesis because
it allows solubilization of the gold salt without phase transfer and
enhances the photodecomposition of Ph2Te2 into
condensed oligomer species derived from phenyl tellurinic anhydride.28 After approximately 20 min of reaction, the
formation of gold clusters is observed, characterized by a color change
from orange to red. The reactions were followed for 48 h; shell growth
is sufficient to obtain stable nanoparticles at 24 h, whereas longer
reaction times can lead to uncontrolled shell formation. To study
the effect that water, light, and oxygen had on the size and properties
of the Au–Te nanoparticles, different reaction conditions were
used (see Table 1).

2.1.1 Influence of Water
Different colors
can be observed, depending on the amount of water present in the reaction
(see Figure 1a). Modifying
the water
concentration from a more anhydrous condition to a maximum of 0.4%
v/v affects the shell thickness (Figure S1 for 24 h of the reaction and Figure S2 for 48 h) and core size growth (Figure S3). Conditions S2 (0.1% v/v H2O) and S3 (0.2% v/v H2O) for 24 h were found to be ideal for good shell formation;
uncontrolled shell formation and an increase in the polydispersity
can be observed with an increase in water concentration or over long
reaction times. No shell formation is observed under the anhydrous
condition (S1, 0% v/v H2O). Interestingly, when the nanoparticles
synthesized under condition S1 were resuspended in acetonitrile, it
was possible to observe shell formation after ca. 60 min, due to the
presence of Ph2Te2 traces; this effect was not
observed when the nanoparticles were resuspended in absolute ethanol
(see Figure S4).

and spectroscopic profile of the aliquots

of solutions of isolated Au–Te nanoparticles synthesized under
condition S3 (0.2% v/v H2O), dissolved in acetonitrile
(ACN) and ethanol (EtOH). (c) Images of the reaction medium (1) and
Au–Te nanoparticles in the solid state (2) under condition
S3 (0.2% v/v H2O).

It is widely accepted that the surface plasmon resonance
band (SPRB)
of noble-metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag, or Pt) is greatly influenced
by structural factors of the colloid itself, such as the shape, size,
and spatial disposition, as well as the dielectric constant of the
surrounding solvent.30,31Figure S5 shows the UV–vis profiles of Au–Te nanoparticles as
a function of water concentration at 24 h of reaction. A redshift
of the SPRB as a function of water concentration can be observed.
Moreover, a decrease in the band at 397 nm, attributable to the charge
transfer (CT) band between both Te–Te units in the Ph2Te2 precursor, is also observed. These changes indicate
that a larger shell is formed.

2.1.2 Influence
of Oxygen
Oxygen is needed
to obtain Au–Te nanoparticles; when the reaction takes place
under an inert atmosphere (condition S3.1), no shell growth is observed,
as evidenced by the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
shown in Figure S6b. To confirm the effect
of oxygen on the formation of the shell, the reaction carried out
under an inert atmosphere for 24 h was exposed to oxygen for 4 h.
The UV–vis spectra (see Figure S6a) shows an increase and redshift in the SPRB at 533 nm and a decrease
in the 397 nm band (attributable to the Ph2Te2 precursor), indicating the formation of the organotellurium shell.
A change in the color of the solution can also be observed. TEM images
confirm that shell growth has occurred (see Figure S6c).

2.1.3 Influence of Light
Under one of
the synthesis conditions, S3.2 (0.2% v/v H2O), the reaction
was conducted in the dark, with samples taken at 4 and 24 h. The UV–vis
and TEM results presented in Figure S7 show
the lack of shell formation at both 4 and 24 h, thus indicating that
the absence of light hampers shell formation. Two aliquots from a
sample synthesized in the dark were taken after 4 h of reaction and
irradiated for 1 h at 365 and 254 nm, respectively. Shell formation
can be seen for both wavelengths (see Figure S8). Interestingly, when the sample is irradiated at 254 nm, the spectroscopic
profile is different, reflecting the large number of dimers and trimers
formed (see Figure S9). The particle-size
histograms for S3.1 (0.2% v/v H2O, synthesized in a nitrogen
atmosphere) and S3.2 (0.2% v/v H2O, synthesized in the
dark) are shown in Figure S10. In
addition, from the analysis of TEM images obtained under S3.2 (4 h
in the dark) followed by irradiation (254 nm), it was found that the
number of shells without a gold core is drastically reduced.

2.2 Effect of the Solvent on the Colloidal Stability
of the Au–Te Nanoparticles
The effect of the solvent
on the stability of the Au–Te colloidal system was studied
by UV–vis spectroscopy; the solvents studied included water,
methanol, absolute ethanol, acetone, acetonitrile, dioxane, dimethylsulfoxide,
dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether,
and hexane (results for all of the solvents are presented in Figure S11). The spectroscopic profiles of Au–Te
nanoparticles dissolved in acetonitrile or ethanol are shown in Figure 1b. A blueshift and
a decrease in the SPRB can be seen when the nanoparticles are dissolved
in ethanol; this suggests that the shell polymer is dissolved by the
ethanol, creating a lower electron density near the metallic core
and modifying the spatial arrangement of the gold cores. The Au–Te
nanoparticles dissolved in acetonitrile coalesce after a few days;
however, they can get back to their optimal state on resuspension
using ultrasound, which facilitates storage for long periods (Figure S12). In acetonitrile, the core/shell
solution presents a pearlescent appearance at high concentrations;
this becomes even more noticeable with increasing thickness of the
outer shell (Figure 1c). Coalescence is not observed in ethanol: this colloidal solution
is stable for months (see Figure S12).
The nanoparticles can be dried for storage (Figures 1c and S13a). Resuspension
in ethanol leads to the recovery of the naked Au nanoparticles (see Figure S13d,e). Resuspension in acetonitrile
after drying leads to the recovery of the Au–Te nanoparticles.
The TEM images (see Figure S13b,c) show
a certain level of nanoparticle aggregation when acetonitrile is used;
however, the Au core remains unaffected and is in perfect condition
for subsequent applications.

2.3 Characterization of Au–Te
Nanoparticles
Figure 2 shows typical
low-magnification TEM images of the as-prepared Au–Te nanoparticles
resuspended in acetonitrile (Figure 2a) and absolute ethanol (Figure 2b). The particles show a darker gold core
and an organotellurium composite shell.

Figure 2 Low-magnification TEM
images of the Au–Te nanoparticles
(condition S3, 0.2% v/v H2O) in (a) acetonitrile and (b)
absolute ethanol.

Figure 3a shows
a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image depicting the core/shell structure
of the Au–Te nanoparticles. The shell shows no crystalline
structure, and it appears to be formed by low-atomic-number elements
mixed with tellurium. Figure 3b shows images obtained by high-angle annular dark-field scanning
TEM (HAADF-STEM), which reveal a slightly darker contrast in the shell,
indicating the formation of a shell by an organotellurium composite.
In the image, the shell displays the inner structure, as there are
contrast changes inside, which points to a complex shell structure.
The composition of the shell was further analyzed using energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) combined with the STEM unit. The elemental
map obtained shows the relative distribution of the gold and tellurium
on the nanoparticles and confirms the core–shell structure,
with the gold in the core and the tellurium in the shell. The EDS
spectrum also shows the presence of carbon and oxygen in the shell.

Figure 3 (a) HRTEM
image showing the core–shell structure of the
nanoparticle (condition S3 (0.2% v/v H2O)). The Fourier
transform (FT) obtained from the core shows the presence of spots
due to the well-defined crystalline structure of the Au. However,
the FT from the shell shows a typical pattern of an amorphous structure.
(b) STEM-HAADF image showing mass–thickness contrast, with
brighter areas corresponding to a higher Z (1); EDS
elemental maps of Au and Te showing the core–shell structure,
with Au in the core and Te in the shell (2); EDS spectrum obtained
from a group of particles, showing C, O, Au, and Te as the main elements
present (3); carbon K edge, Te M edge, and O K edge electron energy
loss (EEL) spectroscopy (EELS) spectra from the shell and with corrected
background (4 and 5). (c) STEM images showing the complex inner structure
of the shell and the presence of globular areas; the Z contrast in these areas is indicative of a higher concentration
of Te.

The shell was also characterized
by searching for crystalline signatures;
the FT obtained only from the shell areas confirms that the shell
had an amorphous structure. Further characterization using EELS confirmed
the presence of carbon, oxygen, and tellurium in the shell. The carbon
EELS edge, obtained only from the shell region, is depicted in Figure 3b(4); the fine structure
of the absorption carbon K edge shows two clear differences in the
electronic bonding states: one assigned to a π C=C bond
peak at 285 eV and another to a σ C–C bond peak close
to 297 eV. Figure 3b(5) shows the EELS spectrum in the tellurium edge region; in this
range of energy loss, the spectrum shows the contribution of both
oxygen and tellurium edges. The tellurium edge appears as a broad-band
signal, possibly because of the existence of a mixture of electronic
states in the tellurium bonds. An interesting feature is the low intensity
of the oxygen edge, especially compared to the relative intensity
and shape of the TeO2 edges;32 this suggests a clear oxygen deficit compared to the relative content
of oxygen in the TeO2 pure compound.

Higher-magnification
HAADF-STEM images (Figure 3c) show the presence of a complex inner structure
in the shell. The presence of globular areas with a brighter contrast,
ca. 2.9 nm in diameter, indicates a higher concentration of tellurium.
These globular areas with a high tellurium content are distributed
regularly across the whole shell and contain carbon and oxygen compounds,
confirming the organometallic nature of the shell.

2.4 Chemical Composition of the Organometallic
Te Shell
The chemical composition of the shell was investigated
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), FT ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR–MS), elemental analysis,
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA), using a powder sample of the shell (see Section 4). The FT-IR spectrum (see Figure S14) shows typical bands between 400 and 700 cm–1, attributable to tellurinic anhydride derivatives,
assigned to the Te–O bond stretching. This is in agreement
with the experimental and calculated vibrational frequencies available
in the literature for tellurinic anhydride derivatives.27

Results of the HR-FT-ICR–MS analysis
are shown in Figure 4. The isotopic pattern of the signal at m/z 1489.864 amu reveals a species containing C, H, and O
(Figure 4a,b). The
absence of Te can be explained as follows: the Te species can suffer
bond ruptures via oxidative Te–C bond cleavage that leads to
the extrusion of Te;33,34 this commonly happens via the
formation of TeO2 or elemental Te. We have only observed
this phenomenon when the shell composition was analyzed in the absence
of gold, thus indicating that no Te extrusion occurs during the nucleation
and growth of the Au clusters. We have observed signals in the lower
region of the spectrum, which suggests the presence of tellurinic
acid fragments, [PhTe(O)OH–H]+, at m/z 240.951 amu, along with a number of other Te
species that could be derived from the condensation/aggregation of
this species, such as the fragments at m/z 1192.626, 1136.686, and 1392.597 amu (Figure 4c–f). The results of
depolymerization of the shell in the presence of a nucleophilic agent
(ethanol, methanol, H2O) are in agreement with the results
reported by Beckman et al., who carried out depolymerization of aryltellurinic
anhydride polymeric derivatives using nucleophilic species such as
NaOH.29

Expanded sections of the spectrum shown in (a), showing typical isotopic
Te patterns.

Elemental analysis (C
and H) and ICP (Te) of the isolated organometallic
shell yielded values of 26.54% (C), 2.53% (H), and 50.44% (Te). In
view of the values obtained, we have not been able to adjust the percentage
data of carbon or hydrogen to those in pure polymeric systems. These
results clearly show the random nature of the organotellurium shell.

In relation to the thermal stability of the organometallic shell,
the TGA curves obtained for the isolated organometallic shell and
the core–shell system present a simple decomposition pattern,
with the formation of gaseous reaction products (Figure S15). Both materials present mass loss processes at
temperatures above 87 °C for the shell and 200 °C for the
core–shell system. We conclude that the organometallic compound
in the core–shell system is more stable compared to that in
the isolated organometallic shell. This behavior may be associated
with the depolymerization process associated with EtOH treatment,
which would produce smaller oligomers in the isolated shell when compared
to those in the core–shell system or can produce solvent retention.
The mass change obtained for the isolated shell (−38.93%) and
core–shell (−21.27%) is consistent with the tellurium
composition in the shell and tellurium and the gold composition in
the core–shell. Analysis of dTG curves reveals
that the organometallic compound melts at 250 °C for core–shell
and 268 °C for the free shell.

2.5 Stability
of the Te Shell in Acetonitrile
and Absolute Ethanol
Shell stability in different solvents
was confirmed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. The DLS
experiments performed in acetonitrile show size values centered at
ca. 650 nm, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.227. Once the solvent
is changed to absolute ethanol, the size drops to 40 nm, with a PDI
of 0.110, showing good separation of the shell from the metal cores
once the nanoparticles are dissolved in absolute ethanol. These results
are consistent with the microscopy analysis in both solvents (Figure 2). In addition, the
effect of ethanol on the shell is observed by the inversion of the Z potential from negative values in acetonitrile to positive
values in ethanol. The Z potential analysis in both
solvents presents striking reversal values from negative values of
ca. −11 mV/cm–3 in acetonitrile to a stable
and high positive potential of ca. +50 mV/cm–3 in
absolute ethanol. It should be remarked that the reproducibility of
this analysis was higher in absolute ethanol than that in acetonitrile.

2.6 Effect of the Ligand on the Formation of Au–Te
Nanoparticles
To determine the possible mechanism of formation
of the metal–ligand complex and its evolution to a gold cluster,
we conducted a kinetic study of the Au–Te interaction by UV–vis
spectroscopy, with L/Au ratios of 1:1 and 3:1. The results for the
1:1 ratio are presented in Figure 5a (UV–vis study) and Figure S16a (TEM images). The results of the UV–vis study for
the 3:1 ratio are shown in Figure S16b.
The spectroscopic profile of the precursor, Ph2Te2, presents two absorption bands, one at ca. 300 nm (phenyl group
CT band, attributable to the nTe−π* transition) and another
at ca. 397 nm (Te–Te CT band, corresponding to the transition
nTe−σ*). The absorption at 397 nm is the cause for the
yellow appearance of this type of tellurium organic derivatives.35,36 Upon addition of 1 equiv of gold, a new absorption band, centered
at ca. 430 nm is observed; this band corresponds to the formation
of the Au–Te complex. The intensity of this band increases
with time, as the concentration of the complex increases, reaching
its maximum at 3 min. Then, the band decreases progressively, and
a new band is observed at ca. 530 nm. This band corresponds to the
SPRB, indicating the formation of Au clusters. This was confirmed
by TEM images (see Figure S16a).

min. (b) Spectroscopic profile of the Au nanomaterial in acetonitrile,

isotopic pattern for the 1016.738 m/z signal, attributable to a molecular complex with an empirical formula
of [C24H20Te4Au]+.

NMR, Raman, FT-IR, and RX spectroscopy
studies on the Au–Te
complex are hampered by its fast transformation into gold nanoparticles.
Thus, to identify the structure of the species formed during the synthesis
of the nanoparticles, we analyzed the progress of the reaction over
time using FT-ICR–MS, the results of which are presented in Figure 5c. The intensity
of the peak corresponding to m/z 411.888, associated with the Ph2Te2 molecule,
increases with time. After 1 min, a strong peak at m/z 1016.738 can be seen; the intensity of this peak
decreases with time, and it cannot be detected at 60 min. We attribute
this peak to Au–Te intermediate species: the isotopic pattern
suggests the formation of Au(I) intermediate complex [C24H20Te4Au]+ (see Figure S17). This is consistent with previous studies on the
synthesis of gold nanoparticles using organic chalcogen (S, Se, or
Te) derivatives, in which Au(I) intermediates have been reported.19−21,37,38 As the Au core grows, Ph2Te2 molecules are
released from the [C24H20Te4Au]+ complex; the intensity of the peak decreases at m/z 1016.738 and subsequently increases at m/z 411.888. The spectra show several signals
with a clearly isotopic Te pattern. This can indicate the formation
of tellurinic acid, [PhTeOOH]n, and/or
anhydride, [PhTeO]n, derivatives in olygomeric
structures condensed during the course of the reaction. Peaks with m/z values of 616.830, 732.752, and 1192.662
can be attributed to the species [C13H13O4Te3]+, [C14H14ClO8Te3]+, and C26H22Cl3O7Te5]+, respectively
(see Figure 5c). The
experimental isotopic mass spectra for the peaks at m/z 616.830, 732.752, and 1192.662 are shown in Figure S18. The tendency of these acid or anhydride
derivatives to aggregate or condense in random polymeric structures
when the organic substituent is small26 can be linked to the formation of an external organometallic shell
over the Au core. We have calculated the conversion efficiency of
Au(III) into gold clusters through ICP analysis using the supernatant
reaction after 30 min of reaction. The efficiency of conversion of
Au(III) into gold cluster obtained was 99.92%. Only the FT-ICR–MS
signal at m/z 1016.738 should contain
gold in its chemical structure, as it is the only one that disappears
after 60 min of reaction.

2.7 Proposed Mechanism for
the Formation of the
Au–Te Nanoparticles
We hypothesize that the formation
of core@shell nanoparticles occurs as depicted in Scheme 1 and Figure S19 (focused on shell growth). First, Ph2Te2 causes a partial reduction of Au(III) to Au(I), producing
phenyltellurinyl chlorides as a subproduct of the reaction (similar
to that in previous reports21) and leading
to the simultaneous formation of an intermediate complex between the
Au(I) and two molecules of Ph2Te2 (intermediate
1 in Scheme 1). The
Au(I) in this intermediate is then reduced to Au(0) by Te(II) present
in the intermediate itself. This Au(0) forms the core of the nanoparticle.

Scheme 1 Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of the Au–Te Nanoparticles
Two processes explain the shell
formation: (1) The hydrolysis of
phenyltellurinyl chlorides. This is similar to the process described
by Beckmann et al.,26,29 but in our case, no basic medium
seems to be necessary to hydrolyze these halogenated derivatives.
(2) The photodecomposition of Ph2Te2 in acetonitrile,
as described by Sharma and co-workers.28Both
the processes led to the formation of tellurinic acid or the corresponding
anhydride, which condensed into random olygomeric structures.

The experimental observations
related to the increased monodispersity of gold cores under restricted
shell growth conditions (Figures S3 and S10) together with the similar spectrophotometric profile of the reaction
for 1 min compared to that for 60 min allow us to conclude that the
mechanism of shell production should begin at the same time as the
nucleation process under free shell growth conditions.

3 Application of the Au–Te Nanoparticles
A major
challenge in the synthesis of new materials is finding
practical applications for the new nanostructures. We have assessed
the suitability of Au–Te nanoparticles as nanoprecursors in
the synthesis of anisotropic Au@Si Janus nanoparticles and as a tool
for proteomics applications.

3.1 Au–Te Nanoparticles
as Nanoprecursors
in the Synthesis of Anisotropic Au@Si Janus Nanoparticles
Au–Te nanoparticles synthesized under condition S3 (0.2% v/v
H2O) were used to synthesize Au@Si Janus nanoparticles
following the method reported by Hongyu Chen and co-workers.39 A part of the Au core is functionalized with
4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) and the other part is functionalized
with polyacrylate. Silica growth appears only in the area functionalized
with 4-MBA, producing well-structured anisotropic growth of Si over
the Au core. The TEM images shown in Figure 6a confirm that we were successful in synthesizing
Au@Si Janus nanoparticles, thus confirming that the organometallic
Te residual monolayer does not hamper the functionalization of the
Au core.

6, 8, 12, 14, 16, and 18 were prepared in water with PBS at pH’s
7.4. Lanes 9 and 10 show the protein profile without nanoparticles
at pH 5.7 and 7.4, respectively. The graph shows the estimated charge
of the proteins at pH’s 5–8.

3.2 Tool for Proteomics Applications
Reducing the proteome complexity is the key to success in areas such
as biomarker discovery or the classification of samples on the basis
of profiling of proteomes. Our team has reported successfully finding
biomarkers in serum from patients with multiple myeloma, as well as
using profiles of urine samples from osteoarthritis patients as efficient
diagnostic tools. Au nanoparticles were the key to these successes,
by splitting the proteome into two fractions.40−42 To assess the
suitability of the Au–Te nanoparticles as tools for proteomic
applications, the nanoparticles were mixed with a solution of BSA
and CA in equal concentrations; the studies were performed at pH’s
7.4 and 5.7. Results are shown in Figure 6b. 1D-SDS-PAGE results reveal that the amount
of BSA retained by the nanoparticles at pH 7.4 (even lanes) is significantly
higher than that at pH 5.7 (odd lanes), as can be seen from the increase
in the intensity of the band corresponding to BSA. This phenomenon
is not observed for CA. These results are the consequence of the negative
charge of BSA at pH 7.4, which is sevenfold higher than that of CA
at the same pH (−14 vs −2, respectively); the results
confirm the positive value of the Z potential of
the Au core in aqueous solution. The result was obtained with the
nanoparticles suspended in either acetonitrile (lanes A and C) or
ethanol (lanes B and D), further suggesting that the presence of water
easily removes the shell.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Synthesis of the Au–Te Nanoparticles
The general procedure for the synthesis of the nanoparticles (which
takes place in a single step) is as follows. Dry acetonitrile (48
mL) containing 2 × 10–5 mol of HAuCl4·3H2O was placed in a two-neck round-bottom flask
coupled with a drying tube. To this mixture, 2 mL of dry acetonitrile
containing 6 × 10–5 mol of Ph2Te2 was quickly added. To study the effect that water, light,
and oxygen had on the formation of the organotellurium shell, this
general procedure was carried out under different conditions, as shown
in Table 1. The synthesis
procedures in the presence of oxygen were carried out in an open atmosphere.
For the synthesis in the absence of oxygen (S3.1), the whole reaction
took place in a nitrogen atmosphere, and the solvent was deoxygenated
under US and nitrogen bubbling for 30 min. Initially, the reactions
were conducted for 48 h; however, at 24 h, the shell growth is sufficient
to obtain stable nanoparticles.

4.2 Shell
Isolation Methodology
To determine
the composition
of the organotellurium shell, a batch of nanoparticles was synthesized
under the condition S3 (see Table 1). After 24 h of reaction, the material was isolated
by centrifugation to obtain the core–shell system suspension
in ethanol. The color changed from purple to pink, indicating the
destruction of the external shell and release of Au metallic cores.
An additional centrifugation cycle (14 000 rpm × 2 h)
was performed to separate the gold cores as a pellet. The supernatant
containing the organometallic shell molecules was removed, the solvent
was evaporated in a rotary evaporator, and the resulting powder was
dried in vacuum for 4 h. The milky white solid obtained showed low
solubility in common organic solvents.

Janus Nanoparticles

of anisotropic Au/Si Janus nanoparticles, see the Supporting Information.

4.4 Electrophoresis
and 1D-SDS-PAGE
For
information on 1D-SDS-PAGE, see the Supporting Information.

4.5 FT-ICR–MS Analysis
The studies
were conducted using an APEXQe FT-ICR–MS (Bruker Daltonics,
Billerica, MA) equipped with a 7 T actively shielded magnet. To determine
the composition of the organotellurium shell, a batch of nanoparticles
was synthesized under condition S3. Aliquots (100 μL) were removed
directly from the reaction medium at different intervals (1, 20, and
60 min) and diluted to 1 mL of 70:29.9:0.1 (v/v/v) CH3CN/water/formic
acid before injection into the mass spectrometer. A study of the shell
isolated as a solid was also conducted. The isolated shell was solubilized
in ethanol using ultrasound (Branson 1510), and an aliquot was diluted
in 70:29.9:0.1 (v/v/v) ethanol/water/formic acid. Ions were generated
using a Combi MALDI-ESI source. Ionization was achieved by electrospray
ionization, with a voltage of 4500 V applied to the needle and a counter
voltage of 300 V applied to the capillary to obtain the mass spectra.

4.6 TEM Analysis
A JEOL JEM1010 transmission
electron microscope working at 100 kV was used to obtain low-resolution
TEM images. A JEOL JEM2010F field-emission gun transmission electron
microscope working at 200 kV was used to obtain HRTEM images. EDS
maps were acquired by coupling the scanning unit of the microscope
to an INCA 200 EDS system. EEL spectra were collected in the scanning–transmission
(STEM) mode using a Gatan GIF Quantum spectrometer, with an energy
resolution of 1.75 eV (full width at half-maximum, zero-loss peak),
energy dispersion of 0.5 eV/channel, and a collection semiangle of
16 mrad. EEL spectra were background-subtracted using the standard
routines of a digital micrograph. The TEM samples were prepared by
letting a drop of sample dry on TEM copper grids coated with a holey
carbon thin film. To avoid the contribution of the grid carbon foil,
the EEL spectra were collected from areas of the sample situated in
a hole.

4.7 UV–Vis and FT-IR Spectroscopy Studies
UV–vis spectroscopy studies were conducted on a JASCO 650
spectrophotometer provided by the PROTEOMASS-BIOSCOPE facility. A
Bruker TENSOR spectrophotometer was used to obtain the FT-IR spectra;
FT-IR experiments were performed on a KBr disk.

4.8 DLS and Z Potential
A MALVERN model
ZS instrument provided by the PROTEOMASS-BIOSCOPE
facility was used to obtain the PDI in solution and the Z potential values. A “dip” cell was used to measure
the Z potential.

4.9 ICP Analysis
The Au and Te contents
in the samples were determined at the REQUIMTE@UCIBIO-FCT-UNL analytical
laboratory using an ICP instrument (model Ultima; Horiba Jobin–Yvon,
France), with a radio frequency of 40.68 MHz, a 1.00 m Czerny–Turner
monochromator (sequential), and an AS500 autosampler.

4.10 Elemental Analysis
Elemental analysis
was performed at the REQUIMTE@UCIBIO-FCT-UNL analytical laboratory
using an Elementar Thermo Finnigan-CE Instruments (Italy) Flash EA
1112 CHNS series.

4.11 TGA
TGA was carried
out using a
Labsys EVO (TG/DSC/DTA) Setaram (France) instrument at the REQUIMTE@UCIBIO-FCT-UNL
analytical laboratory

5 Conclusions
We have
described the use of organotellurium derivatives as both
reducing agents and stabilizers in the synthesis of gold nanoparticles.
A highly stable colloidal solution with an Au core and an organic
Te shell can be obtained in a single step. The Au–Te nanoparticles
are soluble in several common solvents and can be dried to obtain
a solid-state material, while preserving the intrinsic properties
of the gold core. In addition, the organometallic Te shell can be
easily removed with nucleophile-friendly solvents to obtain naked
Au nanoparticles that can be used subsequently for biomedical or material
applications.

The size and properties of the Au–Te nanoparticles
are affected
by the presence water, oxygen, and light. Modifying the water concentration
from more anhydrous conditions to a maximum of 0.4% H2O
v/v affects the shell thickness and core size growth. Uncontrolled
external shell formation and loss of monodispersity can be observed
as the water concentration increases. The absence of oxygen hampers
shell formation regardless of the amount of water present in the reaction.
The same effect was observed when the reaction took place in the dark.
The studies performed indicate that nanostructured shell formation
is only achieved in the presence of ca. 0.1–0.2% (v/v) water,
oxygen, and light. The lack of one of these three parameters leads
to no shell formation.

The particles were analyzed by TEM, FT-ICR–MS,
UV–vis,
and FT-IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, ICP, TGA, DLS, and on
the basis of the Z potential. The results indicate
the presence of an Au core and a complex organometallic tellurium
shell. We have concluded that Au(III) is reduced to Au(I) by Ph2Te2, producing PhTeCl3. The hydrolysis
of this halogenated tellurium derivative together with photodecomposition
of excess Ph2Te2 results in the formation of
tellurinic acid, [PhTeOOH]n, or anhydrides,
[PhTeO]n, condensed into a random olygomeric
structure to produce an organotellurium external shell.

We assessed
the suitability of our new hybrid system as starting
material in two potential applications. We successfully used the Au–Te
nanoparticles to prepare anisotropic Au@Si Janus nanoparticles. Moreover,
the 1D-SDS-PAGE results indicate that the Au–Te nanoparticles
can be used in proteomic applications. The new hybrid material that
we present here has the natural properties of gold on nanometer scale,
along with exceptional properties of an organic Te shell. This new
synthetic route opens up new possibilities for the synthesis of hybrid
nanomaterials from tellurium.
