Conjugation
of CpG to an antigen induces a stronger immune response
compared to that of the mixture. This study compares the in vitro
immunostimulatory activity of CpG conjugated via either its 5′
or 3′ end to the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA). CpG modified
with an amine at either the 5′ or 3′ end was conjugated
to OVA via a stable bis-aryl hydrazone bond. Similar levels of CpG
conjugation to OVA were observed for both conjugates on the basis
of the absorbance at 360 nm for the formation of the bis-aryl hydrazone
bond, which determined 2.8 ± 0.3 CpGs linked per OVA. Both the
5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates had similar size-exclusion
chromatography elution profiles. The immunostimulatory properties
of the conjugates were determined by dendritic cells (DCs) and T-cells
isolated from mice. The activation of DCs was determined by the upregulation
of activation markers CD86 and CD40. T-cells were co-cultured with
stimulated DCs, and the immunogenicity was determined by measuring
T-cell proliferation and interferon γ production. Both the CpG
5′- and 3′-linked conjugates induced the same level
(p > 0.5) of DC activation markers, which were
significantly
higher than those of the untreated control. Similarly, T-cell assays
showed no significant difference (p > 0.5) between
the 5′ and 3′ conjugates with respect to T-cell proliferation
and interferon γ production. The 5′ and 3′ conjugates
induced T-cell activation significantly higher than the mixture of
CpG and OVA. This
study showed that the end at which CpG is conjugated to an antigen
has no influence on the generation of a T-cell-based immune response
in vitro.

==== Body
Introduction
The generation of a cellular T-helper
(TH) 1 immune
response is important for the development of vaccination strategies.
The co-delivery of an adjuvant and an antigen to antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) has been shown to induce strong cellular immune responses
and, therefore, has the potential to develop enhanced immunotherapies.1,2 Co-delivery of an antigen and an adjuvant for inducing cellular
immune responses has been achieved by formulating the antigen and
adjuvant into or onto a particle3−5 or by directly conjugating the
antigen and adjuvant to each other.6−9

Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN), containing
unmethylated CpG motifs,
are a class of adjuvants that are being investigated in preclinical
mouse models and more recently in clinical trials for immunotherapy.10,11 CpGs activate APCs by binding to toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in
the endosome of the APC. This interaction induces a downstream signaling
cascade that leads to the upregulation of proinflammatory genes, including
NF-κB, which induces the upregulation of various activation
markers on the APC for T-cell binding.12−14 Co-delivery of an antigen
with CpG has been shown in vitro and in vivo to enhance antigen presentation
to T-cells, the activation and differentiation of T-cells into TH1 and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and the cytotoxicity
of effector T-cells compared with delivery as a mixture.2,4,5,8,15,16The
enhanced immune response observed when co-delivering an antigen and
CpG is believed to be due to their simultaneous internalization by
an APC. When delivered as a mixture, only one of the two agents might
be internalized, leading to either an activated APC that does not
present the antigen to T-cells or an APC that may present the antigen,
however, without being fully activated, thereby not being able to
induce a full T-cell response.

For co-delivery using the conjugation
strategy, CpG can be conjugated
to an antigen by modification with a functional group either on its
5′ or 3′ end, thereby blocking one end of the ODN. Additionally,
conjugating the CpG ODN via either its 5′ or 3′ end
to the antigen will result in the CpG motif being at a different distance
from the respective free ODN terminus, which may influence its activation
of TLR9 in the APC. Previous studies have shown that the end of the
CpG that is modified for conjugation can influence the immunological
activity of the CpG.17−21 For example, Agrawal et al. have performed various studies that
blocked CpG at either the 5′ or 3′ end and showed that
CpGs with a free 5′ end were more effective in inducing an
immune response in vitro quantified by NF-κB activity and cytokine
production.22−24 An in vivo assay based on the enlargement of the
spleen and the production of proinflammatory cytokines indicated that
having the 5′ end of CpG free was also more effective.19,22,24,25 These results suggest that the 5′ end of CpG is required
to induce a greater TLR9 activation in APCs. However, for an efficient
immunotherapeutic vaccine, the generation of a cellular immune response
by the activation of a cytotoxic T-cell response is required. The
objective of this study was to investigate whether conjugation via
the 5′ or 3′ end of CpG has an effect on T-cell activation
and proliferation in vitro. This was assessed by activating the DCs
with CpGs conjugated to OVA antigen via either the 5′ or 3′
end and then co-culturing the DCs with T-cells. These studies showed
the linkage of CpG to OVA by either the 5′ or 3′ end
induced the same effective T-cell response.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization of Conjugates
To determine
whether conjugating the 5′ or 3′ end of CpG to an antigen
affects the induction of a cellular immune response, CpG was custom-synthesized
with an amine on either the 5′ or 3′ end, which enabled
conjugation to the model antigen, OVA, using the bis-aryl-hydrazone-linking
strategy.26 The bis-aryl hydrazone bond
was chosen for the conjugation of CpG to OVA, as it has been reported
to be biologically stable.2,26−28 The conjugation strategy is shown in Figure 1, in which the terminal amine of the CpG
was modified to an aromatic aldehyde by reacting it with the activated
ester of the linker succinimidyl 4-formylbenzoate (4FB) and the unreacted
linker was removed by spin filtration. The substitution of the CpG
with the 4FB linker was 100% complete, as determined by reacting the
4FB-modified CpG with 2-hydrazinopyridine and measuring the formation
of the bis-aryl hydrazone bond at 360 nm. Before conjugation, the
OVA monomer was purified from OVA aggregates by preparative size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC). The lysine residues on OVA were modified to
an aromatic hydrazine group by reaction with the activated ester of
the linker succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate acetone hydrazone (HyNic),
and the unreacted linker was removed by spin filtration. The average
molar substitution ratio of OVA with the HyNic linker was 6.1 ±
1.6, which is determined by reacting the HyNic-modified OVA with 2-sulfobenzaldehdye
and measuring the formation of the bis-aryl hydrazone bond at 345
nm. The HyNic-modified OVA was then reacted with either the 5′
or 3′ 4FB-modified CpG at a molar ratio of CpG to OVA of 4:1
to form a stable covalent bis-aryl hydrazone bond. The CpG–OVA
conjugate was purified from unconjugated CpG using preparative SEC.
The conjugation ratio of CpG to OVA was determined by measuring the
formation of the bis-aryl hydrazone bond by the change in absorption
at 354 nm. The 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates were
calculated to have the same level of conjugation of 2.8 ± 0.3
CpG per OVA.

Figure 1 General scheme for the preparation of 5′ and 3′
CpG–OVA
conjugates.

The level of CpG conjugated
to the OVA antigen observed in this
study was similar to that described in previous studies, which ranged
between two and three CpGs per antigen.4,6,7,29−31

The yield of each conjugate obtained was calculated on the
basis
of protein recovery; the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates
had similar yields of 64 and 67%, respectively. The 5′ CpG–OVA
and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates were characterized for homogeneity
by analytical SEC. Figure 2a shows the elution profile for a mixture of CpG (9.4 ±
0.1 min) and OVA (8.7 ± 0.1 min). The 5′ and 3′
CpG–OVA conjugates generated in this study eluted earlier (6–8
min) than the free CpG and OVA. This earlier elution time confirmed
the conjugation of CpG to OVA (Figure 2b,c). The elution profiles of both conjugates were
similar; however, they contained subpopulations of conjugates, indicating
a heterogeneous population of CpG–OVA. The observed heterogeneity
of OVA conjugates would be expected as OVA contains 20 lysine residues,
which are the primary target for amine modification of proteins by
activated esters.32,33 SEC analysis of the conjugates
identified a small peak at 9.5 min, which indicates residual unconjugated
CpG that was not removed by the previous purification step. The amount
of unconjugated CpG was estimated to represent approximately 3% of
the CpG bound to the OVA.

Figure 2 Elution profiles of conjugates on SEC. A 25
μL sample of
(a) a mixture of CpG (4.7 μM) and OVA (1.7 μM), (b) 5′
CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to 4.7 μM CpG and 1.7 μM
OVA), and (c) 3′ CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to 4.7
μM CpG and 1.7 μM OVA) was injected onto a Yarra-2000
SEC column equilibrated in phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.35
mL/min, and the absorbance was recorded at 260 nm.

These characterization studies showed that the
5′ and 3′
CpG–OVA conjugates produced in this study have similar properties
and are, therefore, suitable for comparative immune studies in vitro.

APC Activation by Conjugates
To evaluate the immunological
response generated by the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates,
they were tested in cell-culture studies. Bone-marrow-derived dendritic
cells (BMDCs) were pulsed with either the 5′ and 3′
CpG–OVA conjugates or a mixture of CpG and OVA. The concentration
of the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates was adjusted
to contain 0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA to be equivalent to the
concentrations of controls used. After 24 h, the level of upregulation
of the activation markers, MHC-II, CD86, and CD40, was measured by
flow cytometry. Figure 3a shows the gating strategy used, where following doublet discrimination
(data not shown), live CD11c+ cells were identified. The mean florescence
intensity (MFI) of MHC-II, CD86, and CD40 was used to determine the
level of upregulation of these markers. Figure 3b shows that the 5′ and 3′
CpG–OVA conjugates and the mixture of CpG and OVA induced a
significant upregulation of CD86 and CD40 compared to that of untreated
cells. There
were no statistical differences in the upregulation of the markers
(Figure 3b) and the
upregulation of the MHC-II activation marker (data not shown) for
all three treatments.

conjugates.
BMDCs were incubated for 24 h with a mixture of CpG (0.2 μM)
and OVA (79 nM), 3′ CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to
0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA), 5′ CpG–OVA conjugate
(equivalent to 0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA), or LPS (2.5 μg/mL)
as a positive control. (a) Gating strategy on BMDCs to remove dead

significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
post hoc test; **p < 0.01, ns = nonsignificant.

These
results suggest that the co-delivery by conjugation of CpG to OVA
at the 5′ or 3′ end was not more effective in activating
BMDCs than the mixture of CpG and OVA. Additionally, these results
suggest that even when conjugated through a stable linker to OVA,
CpG can activate APCs, and the linking strategy does not restrict
the activation of TLR9, as shown in previous studies.2,6,7,34 The
activation of APCs, such as BMDCs, with the expression of activation
markers is necessary for a T-cell response. For T-cells to get activated
and differentiated into effector cells, activated DCs process antigen
and present it on MHC-I and MHC-II molecules at the same time as displaying
co-stimulatory receptors. T-cells differentiate into effector cells
following binding to the displayed antigen, co-stimulatory receptors,
and through recognition of proinflammatory cytokines released by DCs
and T-cells.35−41

T-Cell Proliferation in Response to Conjugates
To generate
a strong cellular immune response directed against cancer cells, naive
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells need to proliferate and differentiate into effector
CTL and TH1 cells. Having established the activation of
BMDCs with all three treatments, which is necessary for T-cell differentiation,
it was then analyzed whether conjugation on the 5′ end versus
the 3′ end of CpG has an impact on T-cell proliferation. To
test this, a DC–T-cell co-culture was performed. BMDCs pulsed
with the test treatments were co-cultured with sorted carboxyfluorescein
succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-stained CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells. Figure 4a shows the gating
strategy for T-cells, following doublet discrimination (data not shown);
T-cells were gated on CD3 followed by gating on CD8 or CD4 (data not
shown). The cell dye binds to intracellular proteins, and as T-cells
divide during proliferation, the concentration of CFSE is twofold
diluted in progeny cells. This dilution in dye and, thereby, proliferation
of the cells are detectable by flow cytometry. The proliferation peaks
of the CD8+ and CD4+ (data not shown) T-cells were visualized on a
histogram plot, and the percent proliferation was calculated using
the flow cytometry software FlowJo. The percent T-cell proliferation
was compared between treatments, as shown in Figure 4b. Both the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA
conjugates induced the same percentage of proliferation of CD8+ T-cells
(p > 0.5), which was significantly higher than
the
proliferation induced by the mixture of CpG and OVA and the untreated
control. In CD4+ T-cells, both the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA
conjugates also induced the same level of proliferation (p > 0.5), which was a significantly higher level of T-cell proliferation
compared to that of the mixture of CpG and OVA and the untreated control.
These studies showed that both the 5′ and 3′ CpG–OVA
conjugates were significantly more effective than their mixture in
stimulating the proliferation of the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, and there
was no difference in the level of proliferation between the 5′
and 3′ conjugates.

(equivalent to 0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA), 5′ CpG–OVA
conjugate (equivalent to 0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA), or a control
of either SIINFEKL (2.6 μM) or OVA323-339 (1.4 μM) peptide.

IFN-γ Production
by T-Cells
In addition to proliferation
of T-cells, the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ
is a key indicator for the generation of an effective anticancer immune
response.42 IFN-γ production by T-cells
was measured following co-culture of activated BMDCs with T-cells.
BMDCs were first pulsed with the various treatments, as described
in the previous T-cell proliferation studies, and then co-cultured
with CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from OT-I and OT-II mice. The level of
IFN-γ produced in the co-culture after 72 h is shown in Figure 5. Both the 5′
and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates induced statistically the
same level of IFN-γ production in CD8+ T-cells (p > 0.5), which was significantly higher than the amount of IFN-γ
produced in response to the mixture of CpG and OVA. For CD4+ T-cells,
the IFN-γ produced by the conjugates was also significantly
higher than that produced in response to the mixture of CpG and OVA,
and there was also no statistical difference in the level of IFN-γ
produced by either the 5′ or 3′ CpG–OVA conjugate
(p > 0.5). These studies show that there was no
statistical
difference between the IFN-γ produced in response to the 5′
and 3′ CpG–OVA conjugates for either CD8+ or CD4+ T-cells.

OVA), 5′ CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to 0.2 μM
CpG and 79 nM OVA), or a control of either SIINFEKL (2.6 μM)
or OVA323-339 (1.4 μM) peptide. CD8+ or CD4+ T-cells from OT-I
and OT-II mice were co-cultured with pulsed BMDCs at a ratio of 1:10.

Conjugates of antigen and adjuvant have the potential to
induce
a strong cellular immune response that can be used for the development
of immunotherapeutic vaccines. Activation of APCs by CpG–OVA
conjugates is the first step to initiate a strong cellular immune
response. The in vitro BMDC assay showed that the BMDCs were activated
to the same extent with class B CpG conjugated to OVA via either the
5′ or 3′ end or unconjugated class B CpG in the mixture
with OVA. Previous studies have shown that the incubation of BMDCs
with increasing concentrations of CpG in a titration study has not
increased the upregulation of the activation marker CD86.4 No difference in the BMDC activation between
the 5′ and 3′ conjugates and the mixture of CpG and
OVA may therefore be due to a similar upregulation of activation markers
on BMDCs by CpG from a certain threshold concentration, as discussed
previously.2

The class B CpG-1668
has been reported to specifically activate
murine cells and has been used in previous CpG–antigen conjugates.3,6−8,29,34,43−46 It was therefore selected for
this study to evaluate the immune response toward the 5′- and
3′-linked conjugates in murine cells in in vitro cultures of
BMDCs and T-cells.

Previous studies have reported a reduction
of TLR9 activation by
CpG conjugated via the 5′ end compared with the 3′-conjugated
or unconjugated CpG.17−21 TLR9 activation was determined by a direct quantification of NF-κB
activity following the incubation of conjugated CpGs with J774 macrophage,
293XL, and Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cell lines expressing TLR9.17−21 Additionally, the proliferation of total splenocytes and the production
of cytokines IL-12, IL-6, MIP-1α, and TNF-α following
incubation with total splenocytes in vitro17−20 and measuring cytokine production
and spleen weight following injection of the CpGs in vivo19 were used to determine the reduced immunostimulatory
effect of 5′-conjugated CpG.

In this study, the difference
in BMDC activation was measured through
upregulation of activation markers. An explanation for the difference
in results may therefore be that the 5′-conjugated CpG induces
a lower level of TLR activation than a 3′-conjugated or free
CpG, as shown previously; however, the difference in TLR9 activation
does not translate to a difference in the upregulation of activation
molecules. However, to induce a T-cell-mediated cellular immune response,
only the upregulation of co-stimulatory markers on DCs that bind to
T-cells as well as the presentation of the antigen on MHC-I and MHC-II
is critical, but not the total amount of NK-κB produced following
TLR9 activation.

The in vitro T-cell assays showed that the
5′ or 3′
CpG–OVA conjugate induced a significantly higher proliferation
and IFN-γ production than the mixture of CpG and OVA. This may
be due to the co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant in the conjugates
compared with the mixture.2Within
the conjugates, both CpG and OVA are internalized into the same DC,
allowing for DC activation and antigen epitope presentation. DCs incubated
with the mixture may only take up one of the components, thereby not
being able to induce a full T-cell response.

A direct comparison
of class B CpG linked via either the 5′
or the 3′ end to the model tumor antigen OVA in this study
showed that for the induction of a cellular immune response in vitro
conjugation to the 5′ end of CpG is of no disadvantage compared
with the conjugation to the 3′ end. Although a range of investigative
studies have shown that conjugation to the 5′ end of CpG lowers
the activation of TLR9, previous studies that linked CpG onto either
the antigen or the delivery agents mainly used the 5′ end for
conjugation.4,6,29,34,47,48 A reason for this may be that the CpG ODNs are synthesized
from the 3′ end to the 5′ end. Attaching a functional
group for conjugation to the ODN to the 5′ end can be done
after synthesis of the ODN. However, to have a functional group on
the 3′ end, the synthesis is started with the functional group,
followed by attaching of the ODN base by base onto it until the full
CpG ODN is synthesized.49 The modification
of the 5′ end of CpG with a functional group for conjugation
is therefore cheaper and commercially more readily available than
the modification of the 3′ end, which may be the reason for
more co-delivery studies using the 5′ end for conjugation.
The studies investigating the conjugation of CpG to adjuvant reported
an enhanced antitumor immune response generated by the 5′-linked
CpG conjugates compared to that generated by the mixtures of the CpG
and antigen or delivery agent. The results shown here suggest that
conjugation via the 3′ end may have led to similar strong antitumor
immune responses to those of the 5′-linked conjugates.

In conclusion, this study showed that conjugation of the class
B CpG-1668 to the model antigen OVA via either the 5′ or 3′
end has no effect on the induction of a cellular immune response,
as measured by the upregulation of activation markers on isolated
murine DCs as well as subsequent T-cell proliferation and IFN-γ
production. These results were generated using in vitro assays of
isolated DCs and T-cells; however, it remains to be determined what
happens in more a complex in vivo system. Additionally, although this
work shows that using the murine-specific CpG-1668 the 5′-
and 3′-linked CpG–OVA conjugates have the same immunostimulatory
activity, this effect has not yet been determined for human-specific
CpGs, such as CpG-2006 and CpG-2007, in a human system. These reported
findings have implications for the design of new immunotherapies that
co-deliver CpG and an antigen through conjugation and have the potential
to be further developed for use in clinical trials.

Experimental
Procedures
Conjugation
CpG-1668 (5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGATGCT-3′)
with a phosphorothioate backbone modified with a 5′ amine (5′
NH2–CpG) or 3′ amine (3′ CpG–NH2) with a purity of 97–99% was obtained from GeneWorks
Pty Ltd (Hindmarsh, SA, Australia). OVA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis,
MO) was reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and purified
by preparative SEC (Superdex 200 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,
Uppsala, SE) using PBS as the elution buffer. The OVA monomer was
collected, concentrated with a Vivaspin 2 spin filter (3 kDa MWCO,
GE Healthcare Ltd., Buckinghamshire, U.K.), and the protein concentration
was measured at 280 nm using a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). 5′ NH2–CpG and 3′ CpG–NH2 were modified with a 30-fold molar excess of succinimidyl
4FB (Solulink Inc., San Diego, CA) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15
M NaCl, pH 8 buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The unreacted linker
was removed by buffer exchange in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl,
pH 6.0 buffer using a Vivaspin 500 spin filter (Amicon Ultra 3K, Cork,
Ireland). A 4FB-modified CpG (2 μL) was reacted with 0.5 mM
2-hydrazinopyridine·2HCl (2-HP, Solulink) at 37 °C. After
30 min, the absorbance at 360 nm (extinction coefficient (EC) at 360
nm = 24 500 M–1 cm–1)26 was measured using a Nanodrop 1000, and the
molar substitution ratio of CpG with the 4FB linker was determined.

OVA was modified with a 30-fold molar excess of succinimidyl 6-hydrazinonicotinate
acetone hydrazone (HyNic, Solulink) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.15
M NaCl, pH 8 for 2 h at room temperature. Excess linker was removed
by buffer exchange with PBS using a Vivaspin 2 spin filter. The HyNic-modified
OVA (2 μL) was reacted with a 0.5 mM solution of 2-sulfobenzaldehdye
(2-SBA, Solulink) at 37 °C. After 30 min, the absorbance at 345
nm (EC at 345 nm = 28 500 M–1 cm–1)26 was measured using a Nanodrop 1000,
and the molar substitution ratio of OVA with the HyNic linker was
determined.

The modified OVA was then reacted with the modified
CpG at a 1:4
molar ratio for 2 h at room temperature to form a stable bis-aryl
hydrazone bond. The 5′ CpG–OVA and 3′ CpG–OVA
conjugates were purified by preparative SEC (Superdex 200 10/300 GL)
and concentrated using a Vivaspin 2 spin filter. The conjugates were
measured at a wavelength of 360 nm (EC at 354 nm = 29 000 M–1 cm–1)26 to quantify the amount of the stable bis-aryl hydrazone bond formed
and determine the conjugation ratio. The protein concentration of
the conjugate was measured by Quant-iT Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Analytical SEC
Analytical SEC was
performed on an Agilent
Technologies 1290 Infinity Chromatograph with an automatic sampler
and a diode array absorbance detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA). The column Yarra 3u SEC-2000 (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance,
CA) was equilibrated in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.025% (w/v) NaN3, pH 7.4 buffer, and the column temperature was maintained
at 25 °C. The elution of the sample was performed at a flow rate
of 0.35 mL/min, and the data were analyzed using the Agilent ChemStation
software.

Animals: Source and Ethics
Specific-pathogen-free C57BL/6,
OT-I, and OT-II mice were sourced from the Hercus Taieri Research
Unit, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. The experiments were
conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines established by
the University of Otago Animal Ethics Committee (AEC ET10/13, AEC
53/14, and AEC 09/14). All animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide
euthanasia or cervical dislocation.

Generation and Activation
of BMDC
BMDCs from the C57BL/6
mice were prepared as described by Inaba et al.50 Briefly, femurs and tibiae were isolated from euthanized
mice, and bone marrow was flushed out of the bones. After red blood
cells were lysed with ammonium chloride, the BM cells were cultured
for 6 days in cIMDM containing 5% FCS and 20 ng/mL granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) (R&D Systems). On day 6, either
PBS, a mixture of CpG (0.2 μM) and OVA (79 nM), LPS (2.5 μg/mL),
or a CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to 0.2 μM CpG and
79 nM OVA) was added to 1 × 106 cells/mL of BMDCs.
After incubation for 24 h, the BMDCs were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Near-IR Dead Cell Stain (Life Technologies, Eugene, Oregon), blocked
with CD16/CD32 Fc-blocking antibody (clone 2.4G2, BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA), and then labeled with the following antibodies (BioLegend,
San Diego, CA): CD11c-APC (clone N418) to distinguish DCs, CD86-PE
(clone GL-1), CD40-PE/Cy-7 (clone 3123), and MHC-II-FITC (clone M5/144.15.2)
as activation markers. Fluorescence was measured using a Gallios flow
cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) with three lasers (405, 488,
and 633 nm) and 10 color configurations and analyzed using Kaluza
software (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s
post hoc test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0b.

BMDC–T-Cell
Co-Culture for Proliferation
Spleens
were isolated from OT-I and OT-II mice, passed through a cell strainer,
and treated with ammonium chloride to lyse red blood cells. The remaining
white blood cells were sorted for CD8a (Ly-2) and CD4 (L3T4) T-cells
with MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The sorted
T-cells were stained with CFSE (Invitrogen) (20 μM). Then, they
were added to BMDCs activated for 24 h with either PBS, a mixture
of CpG (0.2 μM) and OVA (79 nM), a CpG–OVA conjugate
(equivalent to 0.2 μM CpG and 79 nM OVA), or activated for 3
h with SIINFEKL (2.6 μM) or OVA323-339 (1.4 μM) at a BMDC–T-cell
ratio of 1:10. After 72 h, the cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Near-IR Dead Cell Stain, treated with CD16/CD32 Fc-blocking antibody,
and then labeled with the following antibodies (BioLegend): CD3-PE-CF594
(clone 145-2C11) to distinguish T-cells and CD8α-APC (clone
53–6.7) or CD4-APC (clone RM4-5). Fluorescence was measured
using a Gallios flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software
version 8.8.6 (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR). Percent proliferation
of T-cells was calculated using the “Proliferation”
feature in FlowJo, which assesses the proliferation peaks of CFSE-stained
cells. One-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed
using GraphPad Prism version 6.0b.

BMDC–T-Cell Co-Culture
for IFN-γ Production
Spleens were isolated from OT-I
and OT-II mice, passed through a
cell strainer, and treated with ammonium chloride to lyse red blood
cells. The remaining white blood cells were co-cultured with BMDCs
activated for 24 h with either PBS, a mixture of CpG (0.2 μM)
and OVA (79 nM), a CpG–OVA conjugate (equivalent to 0.2 μM
CpG and 79 nM OVA), or activated for 3 h with SIINFEKL (2.6 μM)
or OVA323-339 (1.4 μM) at a BMDC–T-cell ratio of 1:10.
After 72 h, the cell-culture supernatants were harvested and the IFN-γ
levels were measured by ELISA.
