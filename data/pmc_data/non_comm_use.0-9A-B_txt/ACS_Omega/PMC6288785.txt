Many
human diseases, including metabolic, immune, and central nervous
system disorders, as well as several types of cancers, are the consequence
of an important alteration in lipid-related metabolic biomolecules.
Although recognized that one of the most important metabolic hallmarks
of cancer cells is deregulation of lipid metabolism, the multiple
complex signaling pathways are poorly understood yet. Thus, in this
research, novel nanoconjugates made of ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were
directly synthesized in aqueous media using phosphoethanolamine (PEA)
as the capping ligand, which is an important biomolecule naturally
present in cells for de novo biosynthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids
involved in the cell structure (e.g., membrane), differentiation,
and cancer growth. These QD–PEA bio-nanoconjugates were characterized
by spectroscopical and morphological techniques. The results demonstrated
that fluorescent ZnS nanocrystalline QDs were produced with uniform
spherical morphology and estimated sizes of 3.3 ± 0.6 nm. These
nanoconjugates indicated core–shell colloidal nanostructures
(ZnS QD–PEA) with the hydrodynamic diameter (HD) of 26.0 ± 3.5 nm and ζ-potential centered
at −30.0 ± 4.5 mV. The cell viability response using mitochondrial
activity assay in vitroconfirmed no cytotoxicity at several concentrations
of PEA (biomolecule) and the ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates. Moreover,
these nanoconjugates effectively behaved as fluorescent nanomarkers
for tracking the endocytic pathways of cancer cells using confocal
laser scanning microscopy bioimaging. Hence, these results proved
that biofunctionalized ZnS–PEA nanoprobes offer prospective
tools for cellular bioimaging with encouraging forecast for future
applications as active fluorescent biomarker conjugates in metabolic-related
cancer research.

1 Introduction
From
the 20th century and ahead, cancer research has experienced
remarkable advances in the areas of diagnosis and treatment, which
were made possible by the combination of distinct domains of knowledge.
New understandings of life sciences, including cellular and molecular
biology, were associated with engineering, materials science, chemistry,
informatics, and physics, leading to innovative technologies for imaging
and diagnostic tools.1−4 However, cancer remains as one of the most devastating diseases
of the current century posing great challenges to scientists and health
professionals.1−3 Consequently, new strategies for fighting cancer
have emerged, such as alterations in cell metabolism (e.g., lipids
and sugars), which are increasingly acknowledged as important aspects
of malignant tumors and may serve for the identification of new therapeutic
targets.5 Moreover, there is growing evidence
that cancer cells demonstrate specific variations in distinct parts
of lipid metabolism where elevated levels of the phospholipid precursors
phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine (PEA) were detected. To strengthen
these features, recent studies have identified that deregulation of
lipid metabolism is one of the most important metabolic hallmarks
of cancer cells.6−9 In addition, modifications in the metabolism of lipids can cause
disruption of several cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, and motility. Moreover, enhancing de novofatty acid
(FA) synthesis, increasing lipid uptake, and lipolysis have also been
considered as means of FA acquisition in cancer cells. In contrast
to most untransformed healthy tissues, which naturally satisfy their
demand from dietary lipids, cancer cells frequently re-activate de
novo lipogenesis.6−16 Liu et al.10 published an interesting
review highlighting that targeting lipid metabolism is a promising
strategy for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic options
against human cancer.5−10

In this scenario, nanotheranostics combining diagnosis and
therapy
of cancer by using nanoscience and nanotechnology approaches offers
the ability to engineer nanomaterials to interact with cancer cells
at the molecular level, which can significantly improve the current
knowledge about cellular metabolism and more effectiveness and specificity
on detection and therapy of cancers.15−20 Therefore, the development of novel nanomaterials for live cell
bioimaging assays has gained crescent interest to assessing the intricate
cellular pathways and complex metabolic mechanisms of cancer cells
and tumor behavior.17−20 Among several alternatives of low dimension materials (i.e., 0D,
1D, and 2D or nanomaterials), colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals
(referred to as quantum dots, QDs) have been intensively investigated
for a broad range of biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. Essentially,
QDs are extremely small semiconductor nanocrystals that possess a
unique set of optical, electronic, and physicochemical properties.21−23 Thus, QD conjugates (i.e., inorganic core and biomolecule shell)
are widely used as nanoprobes for cell imaging and sensing as they
present strong fluorescent behavior combined with very narrow emission
band, high chemical stability, and biochemical specificity. Yet, despite
almost 3 decades since the first report of QDs synthesis, they are
predominantly produced based on cadmium-containing (e.g., CdS, CdS,
and CdTe) nanocrystals using hazardous organometallic routes at high
temperatures, which has increased the biological and environmental
concerns regarding their toxicity. To overcome these major drawbacks,
the development of “Cd-free” QDs such as zinc chalcogenides
(i.e., ZnS and ZnSe) using the aqueous colloidal process has gained
increasing attention mostly because of their intrinsic biological
and environmental compatibilities.21−23 Another key aspect to
be considered is associated with the chemical stability of these ultrasmall
nanoparticles because of their high tendency to grow for minimizing
their free energy, which would cease their optical properties related
to the quantum-size confinement (i.e., bigger than Bohr radius). This
characteristic can be achieved by the rational selection of ligands
acting simultaneously as capping agents for limiting the nanocrystal
growth and agglomeration combined with biological functions.21−25 The presence of chemical functional groups and the length of these
molecules play pivotal roles in the overall nucleation and stabilization
process of nanoconjugates. Therefore, the functionalization of the
surfaces of “heavy metal-free” QDs is of crucial importance
not only to increase their water-solubility and chemical stability
but also to assure nontoxicity and allowing further conjugation with
biochemical entities such as biomarkers (e.g., nucleic acids, sugars,
small metabolites, proteins, enzymes, antibodies, etc.) for specific
tracking and targeting of cancer cells.15,18−20,23,26,27 To this end, QD-based nanotheranostic strategy
is an exceptional platform for the development of multifunctional
nanomaterials that may potentially be used to target cancer cells
for the early diagnosis, tracking, and treatment of specific malignant
tumors. Nonetheless, only few studies have been published in the literature
using QD-conjugates based on lipids, phospholipids, and derivatives
for sensing, monitoring, and tracking biological processes of cancer
cells, possibly due to the insolubility of these molecules in water.28,29 For that reason, most commonly, colloidal QDs prepared in aqueous
media are stabilized by water-soluble molecules such as amino acids,
peptides, polymers, and amphiphilic moieties, where the length and
functional chemical groups of the (macro)molecules play a pivotal
role in the overall stability of the nanocolloids.

Thus, in
this study, we endeavor to design and synthesize for the
first time, novel ZnS QD nanoconjugates directly produced using PEA
as the capping ligand and the functional biomolecule in a one-pot
aqueous colloidal process. Additionally, the PEA molecule has suitable
water solubility to be used for colloidal synthesis of nanoconjugates,
which is dissimilar from most FAs and lipid-related biomolecules.
The results demonstrated that fluorescent ZnS QDs were produced with
monodisperse spherical morphology rendering water-soluble inorganic–organic
core–shell colloidal nanostructures (ZnS–PEA). Moreover,
the in vitro cell viability assays based on mitochondrial activity
evidenced that they were nontoxic to five cancer cell lines. As a
proof-of-concept, these bioconjugates behaved as optically active
fluorescent nanoprobes for monitoring and tracking cancer cell uptake
using confocal laser microscopy bioimaging. Therefore, this study
evidenced that the biofunctionalized ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates
presented promising perspectives “shining light” for
cellular bioimaging in metabolic-related cancer research.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of ZnS–PEA
Nanoconjugates
It is widely known that the toxicity of materials
at the nanoscale
dimension (i.e., nanomaterials) is very complex and not completely
understood, because it is affected by numerous reasons, including
chemical composition, shape, dimension, surface features, and charge.30,31 Therefore, it is of paramount importance to comprehensively characterize
the morphological features and physicochemical properties of the nanoconjugates
made of ZnS QDs with the surface capped by PEA ligands. The ZnS QDs
biofunctionalized with PEA were characterized by UV–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy,
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) with selected
area electron diffraction (SAED), zeta potential (ZP), and dynamic
light scattering (DLS), and the results are summarized in Figure 1. Primarily, UV–visible
spectroscopy was used for performing in situ characterization of the
formation of QDs as colloidal conjugates and their stabilization in
the aqueous medium (Figure 1A). The results evidenced the production of ZnS nanocrystals
with an average diameter of 2r = 3.2 nm considering
the empirical model,32,33 which correlates the nanoparticle
size (r) to the optical band gap (EQD) from a UV–vis spectrum (Equation 1). Importantly, these UV–vis results
proved that ZnS QDs were effectively produced in this process using
PEA as ligand based on the blue shift of band gap energy (i.e., higher
energy, EQD = 4.1 eV) compared to the
bulk value of ZnS semiconductor (EZnS ≈
3.7 eV). 1

QD size (diameter) and nanocrystal lattice fringes (ED pattern); (E)

of QDs with indication of ZP and hydrodynamic radius.

The PL spectroscopy evidenced the production of
ZnS–PEA
conjugates with strong emission in the visible range of spectrum,
predominantly related to violet-green colors (Figure 1B), which are commonly associated with the
nonradiative recombination of charges.21 These findings are very important considering the original design
of these ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates aiming at applications as fluorescent
bioprobes for tracking cell metabolic pathways and signaling events.
They were produced using a green one-pot aqueous synthesis, offering
the advantages of improved simplicity/reproducibility and no detectable
toxicity [i.e., 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays in following sections], compared to the traditional
organometallic process at harsh and highly toxic conditions. Additionally,
these nanoconjugates behaved as “heavy-metal-free” fluorophores
based on ZnS QDs, which are usually considered benign (i.e., cyto-friendly
and eco-friendly) for multifunctional bioapplications. The quantum
yield (QY) of the ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates was estimated to be
typically ∼1.0%, in good agreement with the reported literature
of “Cd-free” QDs synthesized at low temperatures and
aqueous colloidal process. Different from processes using high temperatures
and organometallic media, the aqueous colloidal synthesis of QDs frequently
leads to higher density of surface defects that act as “trap
states” in the recombination process of charges. Nevertheless,
it widely known that the QY can be significantly improved by postsynthesis
thermal annealing at a higher temperature and by growing a semiconductor
shell for passivating the surface defects.26,34

Typical TEM image (Figure 1C) indicated the formation of uniformly dispersed spherical
nanoparticles with estimated sizes of d = 3.3 ±
0.6 nm (Figure 1E),
very coherent with the dimensions of ZnS QDs estimated by UV–vis
measurements (i.e., 2r = 3.2 nm). Additionally, HRTEM
images associated with SAED diffraction patterns (Figure 1D) confirmed the formation
of crystalline semiconductor nanoparticles well-matched with ZnS cubic
structure (i.e., lattice (111), d = 0.31 ± 0.01
nm).

In order to further clarify these findings related to the
formation
nanocolloids in water media, it is crucial to examine the physicochemical
properties evaluated through the DLS method and ζ-potential
analysis (Figure 1F).
Thus, the hydrodynamic diameter (HD) of
the ZnS QD–PEA nanoconjugates was 26.0 ± 3.5 nm and ζ-potential
values ranged from −20.0 mV (pH = 7.4) to −35.0 mV (at
pH = 8.5). These values were attributed to the formation of conjugated
nanostructures made of inorganic semiconductor ZnS QD (core) surrounded
by the organic PEA capping ligand (shell). The overall dimension estimated
by DLS is ascribed to contribution of the inorganic inner core of
ZnS QD (∼3.3 nm) added to the organic outer layer of PEA and
solvated in water medium, considering the effects of the electrostatic
charges and chemical interactions of functional groups of the biomolecule.
These results are interpreted bearing in mind the potential applications
of these ZnS–PEA conjugates in nanotheranostics, simultaneously
as fluorescent nanoprobes for cell bioimaging and functional nanocarriers
for therapy of cancer cells. Considering that the toxicity of nanomaterials
(or nanotoxicity) is very complex and known to be affected by their
dimension and shape (i.e., sizes <100 nm), where the smaller the
nanoparticulate system, the higher is the cellular uptake and, therefore,
the possibility of cell endocytosis mechanisms.30,31 Thus, the spherical morphology of ZnS QD–PEA combined with
the very small HD dimension assessed by
DLS (<30 nm) favored the cancer cell uptake and, if harmful, would
have caused higher cell death detectable via cell viability assays
(i.e., reduction of mitochondrial activity). In addition, using the
same rational approach, the cell internalization analysis of the nanoconjugates
needs to take into account the electrostatic charges of the system,
where PEA is the outer layer. Essentially, PEA is a small biomolecule
and pH-dependent because of the presence of ionizable phosphates and
amine groups (NH2 + H+ → NH3+), which can be protonated and deprotonated by the acidic
or alkaline conditions of the medium and also by the cell microenvironment.35 Thus, based on the ζ-potential measurements
(>−20 mV, at physiological pH), the results demonstrated
the
formation of net negatively charged colloidal nanostructures, which
are expected to reduce their interactions with the negative potential
of cell plasma membranes.36−38 However, besides the nature of
the charge, charge density and hydrophobicity are similarly important,
where phagocytic cells favorably take up anionic nanoparticles. Moreover,
it has been reported that cells do not use different uptake routes
for cationic and anionic nanoparticles. Although positive charges
on the nanomaterials seem to enhance the efficacy of cell imaging,
drug delivery, and gene transfer, it has been reported that cationic
nanoparticles can cause a more pronounced disruption of plasma-membrane
integrity, bigger mitochondrial, and lysosomal damages than anionic
nanoparticles.36−39 Therefore, the common theory that the preferential cellular uptake
of positively charged nanoparticles compared to neutral or negatively
charged nanoparticles is due to favorable electrostatic interactions
with cell membrane appears over simplistic and reductive.38 Unquestionably, despite the intensive research
efforts, the published reports on the cellular responses to nanomaterials
are frequently controversial due to the fact that relationships between
the cell type and the broad set of nanomaterial properties are very
complex and not completely understood.39 To this end, as far as the physicochemical properties and morphological
aspects are concerned, these new ZnS QD–PEA nanoconjugates
fulfilled most of key requirements for biomedical applications as
fluorescent nanoprobes and nanosensors associated with biofunctionalized
surfaces for bioimaging and tracking cancer cells.

2.2 Nanoconjugates for Cell Bioimaging and Tracking
2.2.1 In Vitro Cell Viability Assays Using Cancer
Cell Lines
Along with the most complete meta-analysis research
recently reported,20 MTT cell viability
test has been considered the major assay for in vitro assessment of
cytotoxicity of QD-based nanomaterials for biomedical applications.
Consequently, MTT bioassay was performed to evaluate the potential
in vitro cell viability responses of PEA (biomolecule without conjugation)
and ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates toward normal and human cancer cell
lines.

The results (Figure 2) evidenced no cytotoxicity at all concentrations of
PEA (i.e., at 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 μM) for the normal (HEK
293T) and the five cancer cell types. In addition, there was no statistical
difference of cell viability results between the concentrations for
each cell type, where the average cell viability response was typically
over 80% for all cancer cell types. Thus, considering the international
standard (ISO 10933-5—Biological evaluation of medical devices—part
5: tests for in vitro cytotoxicity) and the literature, (nano)materials
with cell viability results superior to 70% are considered noncytotoxic
(in vitro) and preliminarily suitable for biomedical applications.
Additionally, as a supporting evidence, doxorubicin (DOX), the gold
standard as the chemotherapeutic drug for treating cancer tumors,4 was used as the reference of cytotoxic material
for performing MTT assays at the same concentrations of PEA for the
incubation period of 48 h. The results are presented in Supporting Information (Figures S1–S4)
and validated the expected high lethality of DOX anticancer agent
in comparison to PEA, as reported by the literature.4 Toxicity was observed (i.e., cell viability < 70%) for
some of the cell lines even at the lowest concentration of drug tested
([DOX] < 0.1 μM).

Figure 2 Cell viability responses by MTT assay after
48 h of incubation
of (A) SAOS and MCF7 cell lines with PEA at different concentrations
and (B) at concentration of 100 μM with different cell types.

Therefore, these results proved
the absence of detectable in vitrocytotoxicity
for PEA at the concentrations investigated, which can be attributed
to the fact that it is a biological molecule commonly present in the
lipid metabolism of mammals. Naturally, the conceivable toxicity of
PEA at very high concentrations as an active biomolecule cannot be
discarded, which can lead to some cell metabolism disorder or biochemical
unbalance. In a similar way, in vitro MTT bioassays were performed
using the ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates incubated with the six cell
lines (at 350 μM equivalent of PEA biomolecule; 10 nM of ZnS–PEA
colloidal nanoconjugates), and the results of cell viability are presented
in Figure 3. It was
verified that no cytotoxic effect was detected for all 6 cell lines
incubated for 48 h (Figure 3B), and even for 7 days of incubation no significant reduction
of the cell viability responses (MCF7 and SAOS, Figure 3A) was detected. It is important to highlight
that these findings validated the choice of using ZnS QDs based on
their optical properties associated with the well-known nontoxicity
compared to highly toxic conventional “Cd-containing”
QDs (e.g., CdS and CdSe). In fact, zinc divalent cations (Zn2+) are broadly found in nature in several forms, varying from mineral
inorganic sources to living organisms as crucial metabolic species.
Moreover, Zn2+ is one of the most present metallic ions
in mammals second only to iron (Fe3+).21,23 Therefore, these results confirmed the nontoxicity of ZnS QDs core23,40 as “Cd-free” nanomaterial, associated with the organic
shell made of PEA producing cytocompatible fluorescent nanoprobes
and/or nanosensors appropriate for prospective “safe”
biomedical applications.

with SAOS and MCF7 cell lines for (A) 48 h, 5 days, and 7 days and

equivalent of PEA biomolecule; 10 nM of ZnS–PEA colloidal nanoconjugates).

2.2.2 Fluorescent
ZnS–PEA Nanoprobes for
Bioimaging and Tracking of Cancer Cells
Nanomaterials have
been the subject of intensive studies because of the growing interest
for their wide range of potential applications in cancer research.
Unfortunately, despite remarkable progress in the diagnosis and therapy
of cancer in recent years, it remains one of the global leading causes
of deaths, where the accurate early detection is considered of utmost
importance for altering this scenario. To this end, nanotechnology
based on fluorescent QDs offers a very promising platform for the
progress of fighting cancer using molecular imaging systems for the
earliest and most reliable diagnosis, tracking metabolism and functions
of cancer cells, and improving the current imaging methods. Different
techniques have been used for bioimaging and investigating cellular
pathways in nanoparticle uptake research, including confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM), fluorescence microscopy, and conventional
flow cytometry (FC). Generally, FC has been reported as one of the
most accurate and reliable techniques for quantitative analyses of
cellular processes and signaling mechanisms.23,24,27,40 Hence, considering
the nanomaterial-based diagnosis strategy adopted in this work, non-cytotoxic
ZnS–PEA fluorescent bioconjugates were used for bioimaging
and tracking the endocytosis pathway of cancer cells, where CLSM was
used as characterization technique for bioimaging to be prospectively
applied in future oncology research. Furthermore, these assays were
designed focusing on capturing images at crescent time intervals for
assessing the endocytic pathways as it is broadly known that endocytosis
is the most common mechanism for internalizing nanosized particles
and macromolecules by cells.

CLSM images were obtained after
0 min (control), 15, 30, and 60 min of incubation of SAOS (Figure 4) and MCF7 (Figure 5) cancer cell lines
and HEK 293T (Figure 6) cells with ZnS–PEA nanoconjugate. The internalization of
ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates by SAOS, MCF7, and HEK 293T cells can
be clearly observed, where green fluorescent emission was verified
scattered within the cellular cytosol with a significant growth of
the fluorescence intensities associated with the increase of incubation
time which demonstrated that the nanoconjugates penetrated through
cancer cell membranes allowing biolabeling. These effects can qualitatively
be referred to as system “OFF”, when no fluorescent
emission was observed, and “ON”, when fluorescent signals
were detected, which resembles the typical behavior of a biosensor
(nano-biosensor) based on the fluorescent output signal of the nanomaterial.
Moreover, regarding to spatial distribution of ZnS–PEA conjugates
within the cells, Figure 7 presented that after 60 min of incubation, fluorescent signal
was fairly uniformly scattered in the cellular cytosol and the cells
demonstrated normal and clear morphology. No spatial gradients and
vanishing of the fluorescence signals were detected for ZnS QD–PEA
conjugates transported from plasma membrane to the nucleus. In addition,
there was no evidence of fluorescence emission localized in the region
of the cell nucleus. This is expected because QDs must be released
inside the cell cytosol to reach the nucleus and the escape of QDs
from cytoplasmic vesicles into cytosol must be stimulated by irradiation
with UV or blue light or by modifying QD surfaces with some moieties
that induce vesicle rupture such as dipeptides, like ala–ala,
ser–tyr, or tyr–ala.41

An additional complementary evidence of the presence
of ZnS–PEA
nanoconjugates mostly distributed at the cytosol was based on the
TO-PRO-3 staining procedure, which has a very strong binding affinity
for double-stranded DNA at cell nuclei.4 The results of the DNA-staining based on typical fluorescence microscopy
images for SAOS (A) and HEK 293T (B) cells after 60 min incubation
with ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates are presented in Figure 8 [TO-PRO-3 emission in red
color, first column (a); ZnS–PEA nanoconjugate green emission,
second column (b); and third column (c), the overlapping of both biomarkers].
For ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates after 60 min incubation, the lowest
overlapping of green emission (i.e., fluorescence of ZnS QDs) with
the red emission specific for staining nucleus was detected, demonstrating
that they were predominantly scattered at the cytosol.

For a more comprehensive
analysis, a kinetics profile of internalization
of ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates, the mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of ZnS–PEA green emission, was estimated using image
processing software (ImageJ, v.1.5+, freely available public domain)
for osteosarcoma-derived, adenocarcinoma breast, and embryonic kidney
cells, and the results are presented in Figure 9. The plot indicated a time-dependent enhancement
of the relative fluorescent intensity (MFI) with the increase of incubation
time proving the crescent cell uptake of the ZnS QD–PEA nanoconjugates,
which is assigned to the endocytic pathway. For HEK 293T cell line,
the relatively higher values of MFI can be associated with the permeability
of this cell line, which has been reported to be model for cell transfection
studies.30 A gradual increase of nanoparticle
internalization was also observed as the time evolved until reaching
the equilibrium (i.e., depletion of the concentration of nanoparticles
at the cell membrane interface and cellular metabolism with exocytosis),
suggesting that the saturation stage of intracellular uptake was achieved.42 In addition, when considering that the metabolism
of cancer cells is accelerated compared to normal cells associated
with the lower pH of extracellular and intracellular microenvironments
(∼pH 4.0–5.5), the relative lower MFI was attributed
to the faster consumption of PEA biomolecule combined with the destruction
of ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates by cancer cells. This indicated the
effects of destruction ZnS–PEA conjugates by cancer cells possibly
mediated by enzymatic reactions following the phospholipid (i.e.,
FA) metabolic pathways combined with expected quenching effect of
QDs internalized by endolysosomal compartments. These aspects resulted
in less accumulation of fluorescent nanoprobes inside malignant cells
compared with normal cells.

Figure 9 Cell uptake profile based on MFI as function
of incubation time
for (a) MCF7, (b) SAOS, and (c) HEK 293T cell lines.

The increase of PL intensity verified with the
incubation time
is consistent with one of the primary features for biosensing, demonstrating
promising characteristics of these innovative ZnS–PEA conjugates
to be utilized as fluorescent nanoprobes for cell bioimaging and tracking
in cancer research. It is well known that QDs uptake by cells occurs
through several pathways, including endocytosis, transfection, and
peptide-mediated delivery.

Endocytosis marks the entry of internalized
receptors, biomolecules,
and conjugates into the complex network of endocytic trafficking pathways.43,44 Despite the existence of numerous internalization routes, early
endosomes serve as a focal point of the endocytic pathway, which determine
the subsequent fate of internalized macromolecules such as proteins
and lipids, destining them either for recycling to the plasma membrane,
degradation in lysosomes, or delivery to the trans-Golgi network.40,43−45 To this end, on the basis of the results of confocal
microscopy bioimaging, a schematic representation of the interactions
of the novel ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates with cancer cells at the
biointerfaces is depicted in Figure 10. As an additional tool for evidencing that ZnS–PEA
conjugates were transported along the endosomal–lysosomal pathways,
acidic organelle marker LysoTracker was used for staining late endosomes
and lysosome of SAOS cells. The results of ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates
(Figure 11) showed
good co-localization with the lysosomes vesicles of cells, as revealed
by the presence of yellow dots in the images caused by overlapping
the green fluorescence from ZnS–PEA nanoparticles with the
red fluorescence from lysosome marker. It should be emphasized that
it is a primary assessment with a simplified approach of the very
complex phenomena involving the internalization of biomolecules such
as PEA, which participates in several cellular processes, such as
in de novo biosynthesis of FAs and phospholipids (via a branch of
the Kennedy pathway) by cancer cells.6−10 Thus, we attempted to schematically illustrate the conceivable cellular
uptake by endocytic pathways of ZnS QD–PEA nanoconjugates detected
by fluorescent bioimaging, as hypothesized, designed and synthesized
in this research. Importantly, this study mainly focused on combining
the chemical stabilization with the biological function of PEA for
building novel fluorescent nanoconjugates for cell bioimaging. Besides
the selection of PEA as an innovative biomarker for developing the
fluorescent ZnS-QD nanoconjugates, it also relied on its water-solubility,
distinct from the large majority of FAs and phospholipids, which are
predominantly insoluble or poorly soluble in water. In this sense,
the results demonstrated that PEA can be potentially used as an active
functional biomolecule conjugated to fluorescent nanoparticles (e.g.,
ZnS QDs) for prospective bioimaging, biolabeling, and nanosensing
applications for investigating lipid-related molecules and other biochemical
species involved in cellular metabolism. Though, it must be highlighted
that a more in-depth and comprehensive understanding of the intricate
cellular process of the internalization, involving energy-dependent
routes, expression of cytokines, subcellular localization, and distribution
of nanoconjugates (e.g., cytosol compartments and nuclei) are beyond
the scope of this study and yet not totally understood in the literature.40,45

3 Conclusions
This study proved that ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates were designed
and synthesized using strictly green colloidal aqueous process. They
featured core–shell nanostructures (inorganic–organic)
composed by fluorescent ZnS QDs surrounded by PEA biomolecules forming
chemically stable nanocolloids. Additionally, they presented no cytotoxicity
after 48 h of incubation at crescent concentrations using in vitro
cell mitochondrial activity with five distinct human cancer cell types
(lymphoma, glioma, breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and cervical cancer)
and normal cells (HEK 293 T) as reference. Importantly, the results
of CLSM demonstrated that the ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates behaved
effectively as active fluorescent bioprobes which were internalized
by cancer cells with uptake profiles dissimilar from normal cells.
Hence, it can be envisioned that these novel ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates
composed by fluorescent semiconductor core and functional biomolecule
shell (i.e., ZnS QD core, PEA shell) can be potentially used as nanoprobes
for bioimaging external and intracellular signaling events related
to metabolism of normal and cancer cells. Moreover, they can also
be associated with specific biomarkers for tracking endocytic pathways
of cancer cells because they proved consistent time-dependent internalization
via transport across the cell plasma membrane and intracellular trafficking
inside the cytosol.

The immortalized human
carcinoma-derived (HeLa, ATCC CCL-2) cells, human embryonic kidney
cell (HEK 293T, ATCC CRL-1573) cells, and immortalized human osteosarcoma-derived
(SAOS, ATCC HTB-85) cells were gently provided by Federal University
of Minas Gerais (UFMG). Human brain likely glioblastoma (U-87 MG,
ATCC HTB-14), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7, ATCC HTB-22), and
human non-Hodgkin’s B cell lymphoma (NHL, Toledo, ATCC CRL-2631)
cell lines were procured from Brazilian Cell Repository (Banco de
Células do Rio de Janeiro: BCRJ, Brazil; cell line authentication
molecular technique, short tandem repeat DNA; quality assurance according
to the international standard NBR ISO/IEC 17 025:2005). All
abovementioned chemicals were used “as supplied” without
additional purification protocols. Deionized water (DI water, Millipore
Simplicity, resistivity 18.0 MΩ·cm) was used to prepare
all the solutions, and the syntheses were performed at room temperature
(23 ± 2 °C), unless specified otherwise.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization of ZnS Quantum
Dots with PEA Functional Ligand (ZnS–PEA)
The synthesis
and characterization of ZnS QDs in aqueous medium were performed using
the adapted colloidal process developed by our group,46 where the functional molecule (e.g., PEA) acted as capping
ligand for the stabilization of the nanoparticles. Essentially, PEA
solution (2.5% w/v) was prepared by adding O-PEA
powder (0.25 g) to 10 mL of DI water with moderate stirring at room
temperature for 10 min. ZnS QDs were synthesized via a facile one-pot
aqueous process as follows: 10 mL PEA solution was added to the reaction
flask. In the sequence, under moderate magnetic stirring, the pH was
adjusted to 8.0 ± 0.5 (NaOH, 0.1 mol·L–1) and the total volume was completed to 45.5 mL with DI water. Then,
2.0 mL of Zn2+ salt solution (ZnCl2, 1.0 ×
10–2 mol·L–1) and 2.5 mL
of S2– salt solution (Na2S·9H2O, 8 × 10–3 mol·L–1) were added to the flask (S/Zn molar ratio was kept at 1:1) and
kept under moderate magnetic stirring for 10 min. The ZnS–PEA
QD colloidal dispersions (1.0 μM and equivalent PEA concentration
= 40 mM) produced were chemically stable, homogeneous, clear, and
colorless. This concentration of PEA was required for chemical stabilization
of the ZnS QDs in aqueous medium. These ZnS QD nanocolloids were dialyzed
for 24 h against 3 L of DI water (with water replacements after 2
and 4 h) using a Pur-A-Lyzer Mega Dialysis Kit (Sigma, cellulose membrane
with molecular weight cut-off filter, MWCO of 12 000 Da) under moderate
magnetic stirring at room temperature. After the purification process,
the ZnS QD dispersions were stored at 6 ± 2 °C until further
use.

UV–vis spectroscopy measurements were executed in
transmission mode (PerkinElmer, Inc., USA, equipment Lambda EZ-210)
with samples placed in quartz cuvettes scanning from visible to ultraviolet
region (i.e., λ = 600–190 nm). All of the experiments
were performed in triplicate (n = 3) unless specified
otherwise, and the data measurements were presented as the average
± standard deviation.

PL analysis of ZnS bioconjugates
was performed at room temperature
using a high-power xenon light source (HPX-2000, 35 W xenon source,
Mikropack, Germany) combined with an Ocean Optics USB2000 UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, Inc., USA). All of the experiments
were performed using at least four repetitions (n ≥ 4). Photoluminescence QY of ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates
was acquired according to the conventional comparative procedure using
quinine sulfate in H2SO4 (0.5 M, QY = 0.55,
Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA) as the standard at λexcitation = 350 nm.23,47

The morphological
characterization of ZnS–PEA nanostructures
was performed using a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai G2-20-FEI,
FEI Company, USA) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, where images
and SAED patterns were acquired. Prior to TEM analyses, the samples
were prepared by placing droplets of dilute ZnS–PEA suspension
onto carbon-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA)
and drying at room temperature overnight. The average size and size-distribution
data were obtained using the TEM images by measuring at least 150
randomly selected ZnS nanoparticles calculated with image processing
program (ImageJ, v.1.50+, public domain, National Institutes of Health).

DLS (also referred to as photon correlation spectroscopy) and zeta
potential (ZP or ζ-potential) characterizations were performed
using ZetaPlus instrument (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, 35
mW red diode laser light, wavelength λ = 660 nm) with at least
10 repetitions (n ≥ 10). The ZP measurements
were executed at temperature of 25.0 ± 2 °C using the Smoluchowski
equation method with minimum 10 replicates.

4.3 Nanoconjugates
for Cell Bioimaging and Tracking
The ISO 10993-5:2009/(R)2014
standard (Biological evaluation of
medical devices: tests for in vitro cytotoxicity) was used for all
of the biological tests performed in this study because it is widely
accepted as a reliable methodology for accessing the biological responses
toward new materials and devices.4 The
cells (HEK 293T, passages 18 and 41; U-87 MG, passage 8; HeLa, passage
89; SAOS, passages 15 and 52) were cultivated in DMEM with 10% FBS,
amphotericin-b (0.025 mg·mL–1), streptomycin
sulfate (10 mg·mL–1), and penicillin G sodium
(10 units mL–1) in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37 °C. In addition, MCF7 (passage 29) and Toledo
(passage 16) cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with the
same abovementioned supplements and conditions.

4.3.1 In
Vitro Cell Viability Assays Using Cancer
Cell Lines
As one of the most widely used cell viability
bioassays,4,20,40 MTT experiments
were performed accordingly to previous reports of our group4,40,48 to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity
of PEA and ZnS–PEA QDs. All of the cells were plated (1 ×
104 cells/well) in 96-well plates and the cell populations
were synchronized in serum-free media for 24 h. Then, the media volume
was suctioned and replaced with DMEM or RPMI-1640 media containing
10% FBS for 24 h. In the sequence, PEA solutions (blank reference
molecule) were added to individual wells at crescent final concentrations
of 0.1, 1.0, 10, or 100 μM for 48 h, and ZnS–PEA solution
was added at 1% (v/v, i.e., 350 μM of PEA biomolecule; 10 nM
of colloidal nanoconjugates) of concentration for 48 h, 5 days, and
7 days. Control samples were prepared as follows: control group (cell
culture with DMEM or RPMI-1640 media); positive control (1.0% v/v
Triton X-100 in PBS); and negative control (chips of sterile polypropylene
Eppendorf, 1 mg·mL–1, Eppendorf, Germany).
After the specified time of incubation, all media were aspirated and
replaced with 60 μL of culture media containing serum to each
well and images of cells were acquired by using an inverted microscope
(Leica DMIL LED, Germany). Then, 50 μL of MTT (5 mg·mL–1) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h in
an oven at a temperature of 37 °C and an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Next, 40 μL of SDS solution/4% HCl was placed in each
well and incubated for 16 h in an oven at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Lastly, 100 μL were removed from each well and transferred
to a 96-well plate and spectroscopy absorbance measurements were performed
at λ = 595 nm (iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader, Bio-Rad).
The percentage of cell viability was calculated according to eq 2,4,40,48 where the values of the controls (i.e.,
wells with cells but without nanoconjugate samples) were fixed to
100% cell viability. 2  

4.3.2 Fluorescent ZnS–PEA Nanomarkers for
Bioimaging and Detection of Cancer Cells
The evaluation of
the ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates as fluorescent biological probes
for in vitro bioimaging was performed using CLSM after exposing SAOS,
MCF7, and HEK 293T cell lines to ZnS–PEA QDs, following similar
procedures reported by our group.4,46 Cells were
plated (5 × 105 cells per well) in 6-well plate, incubated
for 4 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and synchronized for
24 h. Then, ZnS–PEA colloidal suspensions (1:1) with the medium
solution (DMEM or RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS) were added to the cells
and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 15, 30, and 60
min (for cellular uptake kinetics study), followed by washing with
PBS solution. In the sequence, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde
(4.0% in PBS) for 30 min and washed three times with PBS, and cover
slips were mounted with hydromount. Then, the images were captured
using a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM Meta 510, Carl Zeiss, Germany)
by water immersion objectives (objective 63× Plan-Apo/1.4 NA).
Excitation was performed by argon laser at λexc =
488 nm and emission was collected at λ = 505–550 nm.
For the reference control (i.e., autofluorescence), cells were incubated
using only the original medium with 10% FBS (i.e., without nanoconjugates).
Plot of intensity profiles and MFI measurements were executed using
image processing software (ImageJ software, version 1.50, public domain,
NIH).

In order to perform selective staining of the nuclei of
the HEK 293T and SAOS cells, after the incubation procedure with ZnS–PEA
conjugates for 60 min, the samples were washed with PBS and treated
with TO-PRO-3 (i.e., following the manufacturer’s protocol).
Moreover, for tracking the cellular endosomal–lysosomal pathways,
SAOS cells were incubated with ZnS–PEA nanoconjugates for 60
min, washed with PBS, and then stained with specific dye for lysosome
vesicles (LysoTracker Red DND-99) based on the manufacturer’s
protocol. In the sequence, digital images were captured with an Eclipse
Ti confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments, USA) using the oil immersion
objective (63× Plan-Apo/1.4 NA). Excitation was performed by
argon laser at λexc = 488 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate)
and emission was collected at λ = 506–550 nm. In addition,
excitation at λ = 543 nm (tetramethylrhodamine) and observation
at λ = 545–645 nm were chosen for detecting red fluorescence
of TO-PRO-3 and LysoTracker. Dual-color confocal fluorescence images
were recorded separately in the correspondent channel and merged afterward
for proceeding with bioimaging analysis and characterization.
