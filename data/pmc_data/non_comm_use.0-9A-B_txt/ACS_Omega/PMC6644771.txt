Herein, we utilize organic radical
scavengers to mitigate the chemical
degradation of polymer membranes without sacrificing their proton
conductivity. Several hydrocarbon composite membranes based on sulfonated
poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPES50, degree of sulfonation = 50%)
and containing organic radical scavengers were prepared and characterized
in terms of water uptake, ion-exchange capacity, proton conductivity,
and oxidative stability, being additionally exposed to hydrogen peroxide
for accelerated oxidative stability testing. Precise analysis of the
molecular weight and its distribution before and after the above test
confirmed that the incorporation of radical scavengers enhanced the
chemical durability of membranes while maintaining their proton conductivity.
Finally, in an accelerated open circuit voltage durability test, composite
membranes showed lifetimes exceeding 1400 h, whereas pristine SPES50
failed after 750 h. On the basis of the above, organic radical scavengers
were concluded to be superior to those based on transition-metal compounds,
not engaging in any interactions with the sulfonate groups of the
membrane polymer and hence not compromising their proton conductivity.

1 Introduction
Fuel
cells, that is, electrochemical devices converting chemical
energy into electrical energy, provide one of the most promising alternatives
to the use of fossil fuels and are capable of clean energy production.
Specifically, proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have recently
attracted increased attention, being characterized by elevated energy
efficiency because of the utilization of a non-Carnot cycle for power
generation, as opposed to the operation of the internal combustion
engine. Moreover, the high power density and lighter system components
compared to those of other cells make PEMFCs well suited for automotive
and residential applications.1

Perfluorosulfonated
acid (PFSA) membranes such as Nafion are widely
used in PEMFCs but suffer from a number of disadvantages, for example,
high cost and insufficient oxidative stability,2,3 which
necessitates the search for better alternatives such as hydrocarbon-based
membranes. In particular, sulfonated aromatic polymers exhibit better
thermal stability and mechanical strength than their PFSA counterparts,
additionally featuring the advantages of low cost and ease of synthesis.4−10

Chemical membrane degradation is another important issue hindering
the commercialization of PEMFCs, being predominantly caused by the
attack of hydroxyl radicals generated during cell operation11−13 on polymer chains and resulting in cell failure. Reactive chemical
species (RCS) such as peroxide and the abovementioned hydroxyl radicals
generated during cell operation are known to attack the main and the
side chains of PFSA polymers and cause their decomposition, which
often occurs under low relative humidity (RH) conditions.14−16 Moreover, an alternative failure mechanism featuring the scission
of polymer chains caused by the decomposition of sulfonic acid groups
has been proposed by Endoh et al.17

Transition metals such as Ce and Mn can mitigate the degradation
of fuel cell membranes by protecting polymers from the attack of hydroxyl
radicals and thus acting as radical scavengers. However, despite their
beneficial effects on membrane durability, the introduction of these
metals causes undesirable side effects, for example, they decrease
the proton conductivity of membranes.18,19 Recently,
we have studied hydrocarbon composite membranes containing Ce ions,19,20 revealing that although the above membranes showed exceptional stability
during open circuit voltage (OCV) accelerated stability testing lasting
over 2000 h, they suffered from a large decrease in the ionic conductivity
with the increasing Ce content, which was ascribed to the formation
of ionic cross-linkages between Ce ions and sulfonate groups. Recently,
the oxide forms of transition metals and silica-supported radical
scavengers have also been suggested to mitigate the degradation of
membranes.21−24 Although the exact mechanism has not been completely elucidated,
these radical scavenging properties are generally accepted.

In addition to those of transition metals, the antioxidation effects
of organic compounds have been long studied in the fields of biology,
food science, and polymer chemistry. RCS are known to induce cellular
injuries such as membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA alteration, protein
damage, and enzyme inactivation,25,26 which necessitate
the development of organic antioxidants (e.g., phenolic and N-heterocyclic
compounds) capable of mitigating these effects.27−29

Phenolic
compounds were the first group of antioxidants investigated
for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries, being capable of
deactivating peroxyl radicals as follows30,31 1   2  

As demonstrated
above, the phenolic H-atom is abstracted by a peroxyl
radical to yield a stable aroxyl radical (ArO•)
that is unable to propagate the chain,32 and the radical scavenging ability of phenols is therefore thought
to be correlated with their O–H bond dissociation enthalpy.29,33 Terephthalic acid was also reported to increase the chemical stability
of PFSA.34 On the other hand, nitrogen-containing
heterocyclic compounds (N-heterocycles) can also act as radical scavengers.
Specifically, electron-rich nitrogen atoms might absorb free radicals,
allowing N-heterocycles to donate a single electron to RCS and remove
free radicals owing to resonance delocalization.35−37 Several other
antioxidants are also known, for example, quinones, which are used
as free-radical polymerization inhibitors.38 More recently, α-tocopherol (TOH) was reported to be effective
for mitigating the degradation of PFSA membranes owing to its regeneration
properties.39

Herein, we utilize
organic radical scavengers to improve the oxidative
stability of polymer membranes because these compounds were not expected
to undergo ionic crosslinking observed for transition metals and should
thus effectively mitigate the radical attack-induced degradation of
membranes without reducing their proton conductivity. Specifically,
four representative scavengers were selected, that is, TOH, 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone
(BQ), hydroquinone (HQ), and 2,2′-bipyridine (BPY) (Figure 1). The utilized membranes
were based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPES50) and
thus belonged to the hydrocarbon type.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
selected radical scavengers: (a) TOH, (b)
BQ, (c) HQ, and (d) BPY.

The effects of organic radical scavengers were screened using
a
Fenton’s reagent/rhodamine B (RhB) method followed by UV–vis
spectroscopy analysis.40,41 The interactions of organic radical
scavengers with sulfonic acid groups were observed by nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), water uptake, ion exchange capacity (IEC), and proton
conductivity measurements. Additionally, the oxidative stability of
membranes was tested by exposing them to hydrogen peroxide vapor,
which simulated the environment encountered during the fuel cell operation.
The effects of radical scavengers were analyzed by gel permeation
chromatography (GPC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and multiangle
light scattering (MALS) measurements before and after exposure to
hydrogen peroxide vapor. Finally, membranes containing selected radical
scavengers were subjected to the OCV hold test under the conditions
stipulated by Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology
Development Organization (NEDO).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Investigation of the Radical-Scavenging
Activity
The radical-scavenging activity of selected chemicals
was probed
by using Fenton’s reaction in the presence of RhB. Because
the RCS generated from Fenton’s reagent are able to degrade
RhB, the time-dependent concentration of this dye in Fenton’s
solution was used to monitor the radical-scavenging ability of organic
species. The decrease in the RhB concentration by RCS can be explained
by eqs 3–5 as follows 3   4   5  

The intensity of RhB absorption at
550 nm decreased with increasing H2O2 concentration
(Figure 2a), which
implied that the degradation of RhB in the absence of organic radical
scavengers was rapid. Successive additions of 10 μL of H2O2 resulted in the progressive loss of the RhB
absorption intensity, which finally decreased to near-zero values.
However, this intensity decrease was less pronounced in the presence
of organic radical scavengers (Figure 2b–e). Specifically, upon the addition of 10
μL of H2O2, 91, 90, 94, and 93% of the
initial RhB absorbance intensities were preserved in the presence
of TOH, BQ, HQ, and BPY, respectively, whereas only 69% of the initial
intensity was preserved under scavenger-free conditions (Figure 3). For 10 μL
of H2O2, the RhB absorbance intensity decreased
to 9% of the initial value in the absence of scavengers, whereas the
values in the range of 45–73% were observed in their presence.
The best performance was observed for TOH and BPY, whereas lower absorbance
retention was observed for BQ and HQ. However, even in the latter
case, the final absorbance was much higher than that observed for
pure RhB, which confirmed that despite a certain variability, the
radical-scavenging ability of all investigated species was high enough
to effectively hinder the degradation of RhB.

of the RhB/Fenton’s solution system

in the absence of radical scavengers and in the presence of (b) TOH,
(c) BQ, (d) HQ, and (e) BPY.

radical scavengers.

2.2 Characterization
of Composite Membranes
The prepared composite membranes were
transparent and homogenous
(Figure 4a,b), and
the presence/state of organic radical scavengers therein was confirmed/determined
by overlaying the 1H NMR spectra of HQ, an SPES50 pristine
membrane, and SPES50-HQ (Figure 4c). Notably, the spectrum of SPES50-HQ featured a prominent
HQ peak at 6.57 ppm and unchanged peaks (1–9) of pristine SPES50,
which indicated that the above scavenger did not interact with SPES50,
particularly with its sulfonic acid groups (Figure 4c). Similar behavior was observed for other
scavengers, as shown in Figure S1. As already
mentioned in the Introduction, although metal
ions such as Ce or Mn are effective radical scavengers, their strong
interaction with the sulfonic acid groups of membrane polymers can
hinder proton transport.19 Thus, the addition
of Ce ions shifted the signal of protons adjacent to the sulfonic
acid group, with the above shift increasing with the increasing concentration
of Ce ions. Thus, in contrast to metal ions, organic radical scavengers
were well dispersed throughout the membranes and did not interact
with sulfonic acid groups.

Figure 4 Photographs of (a) SPES50 and (b) SPES50-BQ
and (c) 1H NMR spectra of HQ, SPES50, and SPES50-HQ.

To clarify, we also measured the
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR) spectra of the composite and SPES50 membranes, as shown in Figure S2. The symmetric stretching at 1055 cm–1 and the antisymmetric stretching at 1220 cm–1 of the sulfonic acid group were observed for all membranes. No shift
was observed for the composite membranes, which implies no interaction
of organic radical quenchers with sulfonic acid groups.

The
water uptakes and IECs of the composite membranes are listed
in Table 1. Specifically,
the water uptakes of SPES50-TOH, SPES50-HQ, SPES50-BQ, and SPES50-BPY
equaled 72, 73, 70, and 69%, respectively, whereas pristine SPES50
showed a value of 73%. Similarly, the IECs of the composite membranes
were almost identical to those of the pristine membrane, that is,
the water uptake and IEC were not affected by the incorporation of
organic radical scavengers, similarly to the NMR spectra. Conversely,
the incorporation of metal ions decreased the water uptake and IEC
because of the formation of ionic cross-linkages between metal ions
and sulfonic acid groups.19

Membranes

a Determined by titration with NaOH.

The tensile properties of the
SPAES50 and composite membranes were
measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (Figure S3). These results are also summarized
in Table S1 along with the calculated Young’s
moduli. The SPAES and composite membranes exhibited almost a similar
strain and modulus. This result means that the mechanical properties
were not affected by organic radical scavengers.

2.3 Proton Conductivity
Figure 5 shows the RH-dependent proton
conductivity of composite membranes determined at 80 °C, revealing
that the proton conductivity of SPES50 decreased with RH, whereas
those of SPES50-TOH and SPES50-BPY were slightly reduced but still
similar to that of SPES50. Notably, SPES50-BQ and SPES50-HQ showed
proton conductivities almost identical to that of SPES50 even at a
low RH, which, considering the organic additives as proton transfer
interferences, was rather unexpected, that is, even in the absence
of any interaction between the organic radical scavenger and sulfonic
acid groups, the well-dispersed organic additive was expected to inhibit
the aggregation of the sulfonic acid into hydrophilic clusters. In
lieu of a better explanation, the retention of the proton conductivity
at a low RH was ascribed to the hydrophilic nature of BQ and HQ. As
mentioned above, the use of metal ions as typical radical scavengers
resulted in the formation of ionic cross-linkages with sulfonic acid
groups and a decreased proton conductivity, whereas all selected organic
radical scavengers did not exhibit this detrimental effect because
they did not interact with sulfonate groups.

Figure 5 RH-dependent proton conductivities
of composite membranes determined
at 80 °C.

2.4 Hydrogen
Peroxide Vapor Exposure Test
The oxidative stability of the
composite membranes was probed using
a hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure test. Notably, the ex-situ Fenton’s
test commonly used to determine the oxidative stability was not used
because it is performed in the solution state and in an environment
different from that encountered during PEMFC operation. Therefore,
the hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure test was specifically designed
to imitate the PEMFC environment and was conducted under conditions
most appropriate for the fast screening of membrane degradation, that
is, at 120 °C and an RH of less than 10%. The oxidative stabilities
of composite membranes were evaluated by analyzing the number-average
molecular weight (Mn) of the constituent
polymer before and after the test (Figure 6 and Table 2), and the extent of degradation was calculated as
the percent change in Mn before and after
the test. Figure 6a
and Table 2 reveal
that pristine SPES50 exhibited an extent of degradation of 42%, which
was accompanied by an increase in the polydispersity index (PDI),
whereas the corresponding values for SPES50-TOH, SPES50-BQ, SPES50-HQ,
and SPES50-BPY equaled 18, 9, 26, and 15%, respectively. These results
show that the incorporation of radical scavengers significantly enhanced
the membrane oxidative stability, with the best performance observed
for BQ and BPY. Interestingly, the observed order of additive performance
was different to that observed for the RhB/Fenton’s reagent
test and the hydrogen peroxide exposure experiment. Specifically,
the latter test evaluated the performance of composite membranes,
whereas the former aimed to determine the pure oxidative performance
of organic scavengers. Although BPY was the best-performing additive
according to both experiments, a discrepancy was observed for TOH
and BQ. The lower performance of TOH in the peroxide exposure experiment
might be ascribed to the poor compatibility of this scavenger with
the SPES50 polymer because of the different chemical structure of
the former, which prohibited scavenging in the polymer matrix.

testing.

SPES50-BPY	71	194	2.74	60	199	3.32	15	
Additionally, we also tested the oxidative stability
in Fenton’s
reagent for all membranes. Even its test conditions are different
from actual fuel cell operation; this is a common method for oxidative
stability. The residual weight % of pristine SPES50 after the Fenton’s
test was only 20%, whereas those for SPES50-TOH, SPES50-BQ, SPES50-HQ,
and SPES50-BPY were 90, 97, 95, and 98, respectively.

Figure 6 shows that
for some samples, the content of high-molecular-weight species increased
after the oxidative stability test. This phenomenon was particularly
pronounced for SPES50-TOH, where the increases in both high- and low-molecular-weight
polymer contents resulted in a broadened molecular weight distribution,
as confirmed by numerous repetitions of this test. In view of the
above, we hypothesized that the generated radicals could recombine
with the polymer and change its conformation and molecular weight,
in line with the report of Mack et al.42 Specifically, if the polymer chains are attacked by RCS during the
durability test, reactive radicals could be transferred to the SPES50
polymer chain and eventually lead to an intermolecular recombination
reaction with radicals on other SPES50 polymers. Mack et al. showed
that increase in the molecular weights was observed for some polymers
subjected to the Fenton’s test, which was ascribed to the washing
out of low-molecular-weight polymers during the test and/or to polymer–residual
radical recombination. Herein, we tried to identify the cause of this
abnormal behavior by subjecting SPES50-TOH to DLS and MALS measurements
before and after the test (Figure 7 and Table S2). Figure 7 shows that the Z-average diameter of the polymer increased from 43.2 to
68.5 nm after the oxidative stability test, with the diameter distribution
being almost identical to that obtained from the GPC profile and featuring
simultaneous increases in the abundances of both low- and high-molecular-weight
species.

Figure 7 DLS diagrams obtained before/after oxidative stability testing.

An MALS analysis offered more
detailed data for further discussion,
as listed in Table S2. The constant [a] of the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada equation was
calculated and correlated with the polymer conformation, reflecting
a conformation change to spherical from random-coil. The spherical
structure was ascribed to polymer vulcanization, which sometimes occurs
in rubber and olefin polymers upon UV light exposure. However, further
studies are needed to identify the underlying reason more clearly.

This phenomenon might be unfavorable for fuel cell membranes. Although
radicals were simply thought to degrade polymers and thus lower the
chemical durability of membranes, the mechanical properties of membranes
could also be affected, that is, radical-induced crosslinking might
decrease the membrane viscoelasticity and result in embrittlement.
Thus, the mechanical degradation of membranes during wet–dry
cycling can be accelerated by their crosslinking. A new class of radical
scavengers can be suggested to mitigate the crosslinking of membranes.
For example, additional functional groups or additives for suppressing
the chain transfer of radicals might be suitable candidates.

2.5 Accelerated OCV Test
On the basis
of the conductivity data and the results of the hydrogen peroxide
exposure experiment, we identified BQ and BPY as the best-performing
radical scavengers and therefore characterized membrane electrode
assemblies (MEAs) prepared from SPES50, SPES50-BQ, and SPES50-BPY
in-situ by the accelerated OCV hold test (NEDO conditions, 90 °C
and 30% RH). As shown in Figure 8, SPES50 membranes impregnated with organic radical
scavengers exhibited stable OCV operation for up to 1400 h, whereas
the performance of pristine SPES50 declined after 750 h. Moreover,
voltage drops of 184 (after ∼750 h), 42 (1400 h), and 64 (1400
h) μV/h were observed for SPES50, SPES50-BQ, and SPES50-BPY,
respectively. However, the OCV of SPES50-BPY started to decrease after
1200 h, whereas that of SPES50-BQ remained stable up to 1400 h. The
hydrogen crossover current of the MEAs was also measured by using
the linear-sweep voltammogram (LSV) after the test or periodically.
The initial hydrogen crossover current densities of all MEAs were
almost the same; however, the LSV of the SPES50 MEA could not be measured,
even after 730 h of operation because the hydrogen crossover current
exceeded the range of our analysis equipment. The LSVs of the SPES50-BQ
and SPES50-BPY MEAs gradually increased with the OCV time; however,
they were much lower than that of the pristine SPES50 MEA.

Figure 8 Time dependence
of the OCV observed during accelerated stability
testing at 90 °C and 30% RH (NEDO conditions).

These results were consistent with those of hydrogen
peroxide exposure
experiments and indicated the successful functioning of organic additives
in membranes as radical scavengers. However, the OCVs of SPES50-BQ
and SPES50-BPY are decreasing, and their molecular weights were observed
to decrease to 53 and 60% of their original values after the test.
The IEC values of SPES50-BQ and SPES50-BPY after the OCV were 1.83
and 1.85 meq/g, respectively, which were more than 90% of the original
IEC. Our recent post-test analysis of the OCV test has found that
the degradation of both sulfonic acid functional groups and ether
linkages in the polymer backbone was responsible for the decrease
in the molecular weight.20

This implies
that BQ and BPY might slowly diffuse out of the catalyst
layer, resulting in failure of the membrane. More stable and promising
radical scavengers seem to be required in the future in terms of the
long-term stability.

3 Conclusions
Herein,
we successfully improved the oxidative stability of hydrocarbon-based
composite PEMFC membranes by impregnation with organic radical scavengers,
which were shown to be superior to transition metals. Specifically,
the use of transition metal additives resulted in the formation of
ionic cross-linkages with polymer sulfonate groups, and thus decreased
the proton conductivity, whereas no such negative effect was observed
for organic radical scavengers, which could effectively mitigate radical
attack-induced membrane degradation. NMR, water uptake, IEC, and proton
conductivity data showed that organic radical scavengers did not interact
with the sulfonic acid groups of SPES50, in contrast to metal-based
radical scavengers, effectively mitigating the oxidative degradation
of membranes, as confirmed by molecular weight measurements before
and after the hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure test. However, the
unexpected radical crosslinking (as confirmed by DLS and MALS data)
could potentially deteriorate the mechanical properties of membranes.

Finally, organic radical scavenger-impregnated membranes performed
well in the fuel cell test, with the overall best performance observed
for BQ. Thus, the present work provides a new way of enhancing the
performance of PEMFCs and is expected to facilitate their commercialization.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
SPES50
(degree of sulfonation
= 50%) was purchased from Yanjin Company (China). Dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) were sourced from Duksan Pure Chemicals (Korea). HQ, BPY, BQ,
and RhB were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).

4.2 Prescreening of the Radical Scavenging Activity
Fenton’s
reagent and RhB were used to investigate the activity
of radical scavengers.40,41 Typically, 0.2 mmol of an organic
radical scavenger was added to 20 mL of deionized water with 6 ppm
RhB containing 30 ppm Fenton’s catalyst and 0.25 mmol H2SO4 (for better dissolution of radical scavengers39), and the reaction mixture was stirred to obtain
a homogeneous solution. Subsequently, 10 μL of aqueous 3 wt
% H2O2 was added dropwise, and the mixture was
stirred for 10 min to reach equilibrium, which was followed by repeated
addition of 10 μL of H2O2. This procedure
was repeated six times to reach an H2O2 amount
of 60 μL, and UV spectra were recorded at every 10 min equilibrium
at a given concentration. All experiments were performed in duplicates,
and the obtained results were reported as averages of two measurements.

4.3 Preparation of Composite Membranes
SPES50
was dissolved in DMSO to obtain a 10 wt % solution that was
subsequently treated with TOH, BQ, HQ, or BPY (a loading of 2.5 mol
% per sulfonic acid group of SPES50 was used), and the resulting mixtures
were stirred in nitrogen at 25 °C for 8 h to obtain transparent
solutions. The above solutions were poured onto a flat glass plate
and dried at 70 °C for 8 h to achieve a membrane thickness of
50 μm. The thus prepared membranes were oven-dried at 120 °C
for 6 h in vacuum, washed with deionized water to remove residual
solvents, and denoted as SPES50-XX, where XX stands for the utilized
organic radical scavenger.

4.4 Characterization of Composite
Membranes
The as-prepared composite membranes were analyzed
by 1H NMR (Bruker AVANCE III, 600 MHz) using deuterated
DMSO (DMSO-d6) as the solvent. The FT-IR
spectra were measured
using a Nicolet-5700 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Electron Corporation,
USA) equipped with a diamond-attenuated total reflection accessory.

To determine the water uptake, composite membranes were oven-dried
at 120 °C in vacuum for 24 h and immediately weighed. Importantly,
the oven was connected to a nitrogen gas source to minimize the contact
with atmospheric moisture. Subsequently, the dried membranes were
immersed into deionized water at room temperature for 24 h, and the
water uptake was calculated as 6  where Wwet and Wdry represent the membrane weights in the wet
and dry states, respectively.

IECs were measured by back titration.
Typically, membranes were
immersed into a large excess of 5 M aqueous NaCl for 24 h, and HCl
produced by ion exchange was titrated with 0.01 N NaOH using a titrator
(Metrohm 848 Titrino Plus, Swiss). The IEC was calculated as 7  where VNaOH and CNaOH represent the consumed volume
and concentration
of NaOH, respectively.

The proton conductivities were measured
in a BeckTech four-probe-type
conductivity cell using a Solartron 1260 impedance/gain-phase analyzer
and a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface. The proton conductivity
was determined at 80 °C and variable RH as 8  where D is the distance between
electrodes, L is the membrane width, B is the membrane thickness, and R is the impedance
resistance.

The GPC instrument used to estimate the molecular
weight was equipped
with a UV–visible detector (YL 9120, Young Lin, Korea), and
a system featuring three columns (Showdex KD-802.5, KD-804, and KD-805)
connected in series was used for accurate molecular weight analysis.
HPLC-grade DMF containing 0.05 M LiBr was used as the mobile phase
at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and molecular weight calibration was
performed using a polystyrene standard. The tensile strengths of the
membranes were confirmed using a universal test machine (UTM) (TopTac
2000, Yeonjin Corp., Korea). The stress versus strain curves were
obtained for samples that were cut into a dumbbell shape according
to the JIS K 6251-7 standard [35 × 6 mm2 (total),
15 × 2 mm2 (test area)]. The measurements were performed
at a strain rate of 10 mm/min at room temperature.

4.5 Accelerated Oxidative Stability Test
Oxidative stability
testing was performed by exposing composite membranes
to hydrogen peroxide vapor to imitate fuel cell operation conditions.43 Typically, 2 × 2 cm2 membrane
samples were held in a specially designed chamber at 120 °C for
38 h at RH = 10%. Hydrogen peroxide vapor, generated by heating a
reservoir containing 10 wt % aqueous hydrogen peroxide and deionized
water, was introduced into the chamber using ultrapure nitrogen gas
as the carrier. After the test, membranes were washed with deionized
water several times and dried at room temperature. The molecular weights
of the composite membranes before and after the test were checked
by GPC to estimate the degree of oxidative degradation. DLS (Zetasizer
Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK) and MALS (Wyatt MALS system, DAWN
8+, Wyatt Technology Corporation, USA) measurements were used to measure
the particle size and molecular weight of the polymer, respectively.
The oxidative stability of the membranes was also evaluated by immersing
the membrane samples in the Fenton’s reagent (3% H2O2 containing 3 ppm FeSO4) at 30 °C for
24 h. The change in weights before and after the test was measured.

4.6 In Situ OCV Accelerated Oxidative Stability
Test
For long-term stability tests, MEAs were prepared as
follows. A decal transfer film was coated with a carbon-supported
Pt catalyst (HISPEC4000, Johnson Matthey Catalysts) and a Nafion ionomer
(Dupont, 20 wt %), and electrodes with an area of 9 cm2 were applied to both sides of the membrane upon 20 min of compression
at 100 °C with edge sealing. Pt anode and Pt cathode catalysts
were used at loadings of 0.24 and 0.21 mg/cm2, respectively.
Following the NEDO guidelines, the accelerated oxidative stability
test was performed at 90 °C and 30% RH with hydrogen (anode)
and air (cathode) supplied to the electrodes at flow rates of 0.20
and 0.42 L/min, respectively. The OCV was continuously monitored using
a potentiostat (ZIVE SP2, WonATech, Korea). The LSV measurements were
carried out with hydrogen supplied to the anode at a rate of 0.2 L/min
and nitrogen supplied to the cathode at a rate of 0.5 L/min to measure
the hydrogen crossover current from the anode to the cathode for every
one or two hundred hours. The potential was swept from 0.1 to 0.6
V at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s, and the hydrogen crossover current
was obtained at a potential of 0.6 V.
