Currently,
there is a growing concern regarding water remediation
from agricultural and domestic wastewaters. Among water treatment
methods, flocculation is a widely used approach. In this study, the
bioflocculation of wastewaters from Sinaloa (Mexico) was examined
using two bioflocculants: chitosan and bean straw flour (BSF). The
jar-test results showed that chitosan exhibited high effectiveness
in pollutant removal from different sampling zones (agricultural wastewater
and river water). Additionally, this bioflocculant reduced remarkably
the concentration of Mn and Fe. On the other hand, BSF showed high
effectiveness in pollutant removal for a specific type of wastewater,
being highly competitive as compared to chitosan. Besides, BSF led
to 40% of Mn removal from highly contaminated river water samples.
For both biomaterials, bioflocculation was driven by charge neutralization
and sweep flocculation mechanisms. For a given agricultural wastewater
sample, both bioflocculants performed better than the commercial poly(aluminum
chloride) for pH regulation and Fe removal.

==== Body
Introduction
Agricultural wastewater is one of the
main problems that affect
biodiversity in different regions worldwide. Agricultural effluents
are originated by the excess of water employed in irrigation systems.
These raw waters contain residual fertilizers and pesticides which
are hazardous pollutants that eventually contaminate natural water
sources such as rivers used for drinking water production.1,2 Besides, some of these pollutants are present for many years (e.g.
organochlorine pesticides).3,4 Consequently, residual
agrochemicals change the chemical environment of the water bodies,
causing a disruption of the ecological balance and representing a
potential risk for human health.5−7 As an example, Sinaloa (Mexico)
is a state with high agricultural and fishing activities, where the
coastal pollution plays a significant role triggering a decrease in
the shrimp production.8 In the Culiacan
Valley of Sinaloa, the presence of organochlorine and organophosphorus
pesticides and polychlorobiphenyls has been determined in the sediments
of the agricultural drainage system.9 Also
in the same region, Culiacan and Presidio Rivers have registered fluctuations
in their chemical environment owing to the release of urban sewage
and agricultural wastes.10,11 Additionally, organochlorine
pesticides have been identified in the gonad, brain, and blood of
mice from two agricultural areas of Sinaloa, which suggested that
the variety of organochlorine pesticides in direct or indirect contact
with nontarget organisms could deteriorate the health of animals and
humans due to toxic effects and accumulation.12 Therefore, the treatment of effluents associated to agricultural
activity is clearly required.

As it is well known, water remediation
is one of the main issues
around the planet given that the worldwide demand of clean water and
the environmental balance must be carefully sustained. At the industry
scale, flocculation is a major process allowing the removal of suspended
solids from wastewaters, water clarification, and also decontamination
of wastewaters.13 Flocculation is mainly
induced by polymeric organic-based flocculants such as polyacrylamide-based
products from petroleum-based resources. However, the use of synthetic
flocculants causes serious environmental and health problems, as well
as it generates controversy related to the production of large volumes
of toxic sludge and the dispersion of acrylamide oligomers, being
a health hazard due to its carcinogenic and neurotoxic consequences.
For these reasons, alternative natural materials referred as bioflocculants
have been developed for wastewater treatment. This eco-friendly approach
involves biodegradability and sustainability with the exploitation
of byproducts obtained from human activities such as fishing, agriculture,
industry, and others. Examples of bioflocculants include alginate,
cellulosic materials, starch, chitosan, xanthan gum, Moringa oleifera, okra, guar gum and Cassia tora gum, and tannins, which represent economically
viable and safe substitutes of synthetic flocculants.14,15

The biopolymer chitosan, obtained from the second most abundant
natural polysaccharide called chitin (Figure 1), deserves particular attention in water
and wastewater treatment. This amino-polysaccharide is nontoxic, biocompatible,
and biodegradable and presents outstanding performances in bioflocculation-
and sorption-oriented processes. Chitosan is also interesting in direct
flocculation because it combines the two functions of coagulation
and flocculation in industrial wastewater treatment. It can neutralize
the negative charges and also bridge the aggregate of destabilized
particles.16 In the end of the 2000s, Crini’s
group proposed direct bioflocculation using low-cost chitosan as a
novel eco-friendly approach to treat wastewater from pulp and paper
plant to treat dye molecules.16 Bioflocculant
chitosan acted both by polymer bridging and charge neutralization
and sorption, enhancing the formation of larger flocs. Chitosan has
also drawn particular attention for the removal of permethrin, an
organochlorine pesticide. The results showed that the performance
was higher with the increase of adsorbent dosage up to a specific
value; then further adsorbent concentrations did not affect significantly
the removal percentage.17,18 In another work, the
removal of commercial pyrethroid and dithiocarbamate pesticides from
model wastewaters has been assessed, where results (removal efficiency
around 90%) suggested similar interactions between the biopolymer
and different target molecules. For that, the charge neutralization
was found to be the dominant mechanism during the flocculation process.19 Chitosan can be also used for the removal of
metals and particles such as colloids and dissolved organic matter.
With raw samples of river water and agricultural wastewater, a high
efficiency of chitosan in turbidity removal (TR) has been reached
in batch trials. In this case, an optimal dosage of chitosan was required
for decreasing turbidity in both water types, whereas the flocculation
mechanism was dependent on the water composition, being in agreement
with adsorption charge neutralization for river water and sweep flocculation
for wastewater.20

structures of chitin and chitosan
units.

On the other hand, agricultural
byproducts involving bean plant
residues could be proposed as a low-cost, renewable, and sustainable
cellulosic material with potential application in water remediation.
As an example, mung bean husk (Vigna mungo) has been tested as a sorbent for the removal of Cd2+ from aqueous solutions.21 The authors
reported that the sorption process was dependent on experimental conditions,
for example, pH, and the maximum removal of Cd2+ was recorded
as 35.41 mg g–1 (at pH 5). They concluded that this
eco-friendly and low-cost material could be efficiently used as a
sorbent for metal removal.21 Another study
performed an optimization of batch and dynamic flow conditions for
Sb3+ sorption using green bean husk (Vigna
radiata). The sorption results also demonstrated that
the metal removal was affected by process parameters such as pH, sorbate
and sorbent concentration, and contact time. The maximum Sb3+ sorption capacity apparently was 20.14 mg g–1 (at
pH 4, 25 °C and 60 min).22 Another
example is the sorption of ranitidine hydrochloride onto a biochar-based
material. The process has been evaluated in a fixed bed column employing
superheated steam-activated biochar derived from bean husk. The result
showed that the highest adsorptive capacity of the sorbent was 12
mg g–1.23 In all these
examples, bioproducts have been used as a sorbent but they could be
also applied as eco-friendly bioflocculants.

According to the
current literature regarding direct bioflocculation,
additional exploration using eco-friendly flocculants for the remediation
of raw agricultural wastewater is required. In this study, the performances
of chitosan and bean straw flour (BSF) (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) for the treatment of raw agricultural wastewater (from the state
of Sinaloa, Mexico) and urban river water (source for drinking water
production) were evaluated using a direct flocculation process. In
order to carry out this task effectively, a set of flocculation Jar-tests
was conducted under different conditions.

Results and Discussion
Wastewater
in Contact with Humans and Animals in Sinaloa
In the last
decades, water remediation has attracted growing interest
within the scientific community given that the water demand and the
ecological balance are in risk and must be carefully sustained. Despite
the use of new technologies and the expanded role of federal governments
toward the environmental protection, there is still an important concern
owing to the widespread problem of water pollution. As an example, Figure 2 shows some zones
of the state of Sinaloa (Mexico) where wastewater samples for this
study were taken. (A) Campo Cinco y Medio (CCM) (Culiacan): the arrival
of dairy shed effluents and agricultural wastewater (A-1), domestic
wastewater arrival (A-2), and the sampling point of the resultant
mixed water (A-3); unfortunately, people of the village, surrounding
towns, and ecosystems are vulnerable to this hazardous effluent with
milky appearance. (B) El Salado (ES) (Elota): the sampling point involving
agricultural wastewater derived of conventional maize and tomato crops
(B-1) and water supply used directly for domestic purposes (B-2).
In this last case, agricultural wastewater flows close to the domestic
water source of Salado village (∼40 m); in addition, this sewage
is subsequently deposited on the Elota River, and thus their contaminants
could be eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, sewage
should be treated in order to remove toxic substances such as the
32 compounds detected at concentrations between 0.03 and 1294 ng g–1 dry weight in agricultural drainage systems of Culiacan
Valley. From analyses, the chemicals registered were as follows: organochlorine
pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, and polychlorobiphenyls,
as well as permethrin, triadimefon, and fipronil, from which 5 pesticides
were found to be above the permissible concentration.9

Zeta Potential of Dispersions Containing Chitosan or BSF
It is known that molecular and electrostatic interactions among coagulant–flocculant
and pollutants depend on solution pH owing to the variations in particle
charge. Hence, the electrokinetic phenomenon in aqueous systems containing
chitosan or BSF was studied before Jar-test experiments. For that,
measurements of zeta potential (ζ) were performed at different
pH values by adjusting with NaOH (0.1 M) and HCl (0.1 M). As it can
be seen in Figure 3, the high stability of chitosan solutions having pH < 6 was demonstrated
with ζ data higher than 20 mV, which is obviously related to
the protonation of the amino group (pKa near to 6.4)19 yielding positively charged
polymeric chains. The isoelectric point (ζ = 0) of chitosan
chains was between pH 7 and 8, and the ζ profile was similar
to that previously reported in the literature.24 On the other hand, BSF particles were negatively charged
at pH between 5 and 9, whereas that ζ close to zero was obtained
at pH 4. The ζ profile of BSF was found to be in accordance
with that observed by researchers exploring cellulose dispersions;25 evidently, cellulose is the main component of
cell walls in bean plants. From ζ measurements for chitosan
at pH within 6.5–8.5 and BSF at pH < 6, it may be initially
supposed that flocculation is mainly triggered by nonelectrostatic
interactions such as hydrogen bond, hydrophobic–hydrophilic
balance, and van der Waals forces; at these pH values, both flocculants
have ζ close to zero. However, the flocculation can be influenced
by different factors related to the chemical nature of the flocculants
and the field conditions of the samples.

profile at different pH values for dispersions
containing chitosan or BSF.

Pollutants Removal from Wastewater Samples
Chitin (source
of chitosan) and BSF can be obtained as byproducts derived from industrial
operations in Sinaloa, and eventually these materials could be used
for water remediation in this state and other regions. Thus, flocculation
trials were performed for water samples having the following average
values of some parameters: CCM: turbidity ≈ 160 NTU, pH ≈
6.33, total dissolved solids (TDS) ≈ 1175 mg L–1; La Escalera (LE): turbidity ≈ 50 NTU, pH ≈ 7.48,
TDS ≈ 292 mg L–1; and ES: turbidity ≈
22 NTU, pH ≈ 7.63, TDS ≈ 1015 mg L–1. Evidently, high values of some parameters are a consequence of
alarming levels of different contaminants. The first test consisted
of analyzing the turbidity evolution at different flocculant dosages
(Figure 4). The effectiveness
in removing turbidity from CCM samples was highly dependent on the
flocculant dosage. At 10 mg L–1 of the flocculant,
chitosan and BSF decreased turbidity effectively; then the residual
turbidity was in a close range using 30 mg L–1 of
BSF (10 NTU) and 5 mg L–1 of chitosan (6 NTU). With
LE and ES samples, chitosan also led to very low turbidity levels
(near to 5 NTU) after the treatment, and the optimal dose of the flocculant
was different depending on the initial turbidity and sampling zone.
Apparently, the higher the initial turbidity, the lower the chitosan
dosage that is required. For CCM and LE profiles, the residual turbidity
raised slightly with increasing chitosan concentration after a given
dosage; namely, an adequate number of polymer chains are required
to be attached to the particle’s surface, resulting in an efficient
flocculation process. On the other side, BSF reduced the turbidity
of LE samples by around 50%, while the change in the appearance of
ES samples was barely visible using this agricultural byproduct. The
surprising result for the system CCM water and BSF could be related
to the collaboration of some specific pollutants and the acid environment
of CCM samples. Therefore, additional experiments focused on water
remediation using CCM samples with quite different turbidity levels
are presented below. On the other hand, it is relevant to indicate
that flocculation tests using corn straw flour were performed. However,
this material did not achieve good performance; thus the turbidity
of samples remained unchanged. Hence, BSF contains some chemical entities
that play an important role in the flocculation process.

Figure 4 TR from wastewater
samples using chitosan and BSF at different
dosage. Sampling zones: (A) CCM (160 NTU), (B) LE (50 NTU), and (C)
ES (22 NTU).

In order to explore the flocculation
mechanism,14,16 a study of the floc formation,
solid redispersion (breakage) and
reformation was conducted, finding that floc was re-formed after the
desired flocculation time regardless on the bioflocculant type. Based
on TR profiles and reformation experiments using CCM and LE samples,
the flocculation mechanism of adsorption charge neutralization and
sweep flocculation were assumed for chitosan and BSF, respectively.
For ES samples, sweep flocculation could be the predominant mechanism
with both chitosan and BSF. In order to drive toward a better understanding,
some specifications regarding both flocculation mechanisms are remarked.
In the case of adsorption charge neutralization (colloidal particles
are neutralized and attracted), pollutant removal decreases when an
optimum dosage is used, and a complete reformation of flocs after
breakage is observed. For sweep flocculation (particles are swept
out forming an amorphous precipitate), particle removal improves with
the progressive increase in the concentration of the flocculant, and
weak flocs with reformation partially reversible is obtained.14

The evaluation of turbidity reduction
from wastewater (LE, 50 NTU)
at different times was carried out by comparing the optimal dosage
of bioflocculants and commercial poly(aluminium chloride) (PAC) (Figure 5). PAC is one of
the most frequent flocculants used in industry. Its popularity arises
not only from its effectiveness as a flocculant but also from its
ready availability and low cost. However, it has drawbacks such as
water pollution by Al3+ (under certain conditions) and
production of large amounts of toxic sludge. In this work, the percentage
of TR was determined based on the following calculation: TR (%) =
[(T0 – T)/T0](100), where T0 and T are the initial turbidity and the remaining
turbidity at a given time, respectively. Considering the maximal removal
from each curve, changes of TR were registered having a similar trend
and different TR with the time evolution (similar profile). At the
first 20 min, all trials showed similar TR; however, a significant
difference was observed at 30 min, where commercial PAC allowed a
high TR in contrast to both bioflocculants. From 60 to 80 min, TR
using chitosan increased gradually up to values close to that using
PAC, whilst the BSF exhibited a maximal removal near to 55%.

in agricultural wastewater (LE, 50 NTU) by comparing
BSF (30 mg L–1), chitosan (5 mg L–1), and commercial PAC (5 mg L–1).

The flocculation behavior in systems involving wastewater
from
CCM was further investigated because TR from these samples was remarkably
well performed with both bioflocculants (chitosan and BSF). It should
be kept in mind that CCM effluent was apparently the most contaminated
of the sampling zones owing to the presence of waste from dairy shed
and agricultural and domestic activities. Thus, high turbidity levels
were registered because of the uncontrolled discharge of pollutants.
The Jar-test was carried out using samples with different initial
turbidity (160 and 84 NTU) depending on the daily discharge over the
main drainage. In order to explore the flocculation behavior at lower
turbidity, samples having turbidity of 57 NTU were prepared as dilution
from the sample of 160 NTU. Both chitosan and BSF reduced the sample
turbidity to values within the range 6–12 NTU, with chitosan
being slightly more outstanding. As an example, images of some flocculation
tests are shown in Figures 6 and 7. As it can be seen, the opaque
appearance of hazardous raw samples turned clear after the treatment
irrespective of the initial turbidity and the bioflocculant. In all
cases, an efficient separation was attained, where chitosan led to
an improved sediment consolidation as compared to BSF, namely, BSF
formed flocs containing higher percentage of adsorbed water. This
result was expected for chitosan; nevertheless, it was conveniently
surprising for the byproduct BSF used in the direct flocculation.
For CCM samples, additional contaminants could be helping in the flocculation
process when BSF is employed, while this effect was less marked for
other wastewater samples (LE samples: 50 NTU; maximal removal close
to 55%); additionally, the control sample (with no bioflocculant)
remained highly turbid even after 1 h. This means that the high performance
of BSF is mainly related to the chemical composition of CCM samples.
Given that handling and analyses of this type of raw wastewater represent
a risk for human health, only a set of experiments was performed.

Table 1 summarizes
the average values for several parameters of raw and treated wastewater
related to ES and CCM samples. Based on the analyses performed, the
lower water quality for samples from CCM is notable. Results of turbidity
reduction exploring wastewater were discussed earlier. In the case
of ion removal, the concentrations of anions reported as PO43–, SO42–, and NO3– were recorded for raw water and after
the treatment using chitosan and BSF in the Jar-test. The content
of phosphates in water has to be carefully monitored; large quantities
can stimulate the growth of aquatic micro- and macro-organisms negatively
affecting the quality of water. This phenomenon is known as eutrophication.
In order to remove phosphates from wastewater, treatments such as
adsorption, anion exchange, and biological methods have been proposed.26 Unlike phosphorus, nitrogen is commonly accepted
to be relevant only in marine eutrophication.27 Therefore, measurements of total nitrogen content of water after
flocculation were omitted in the present research. However, monitoring
nitrite concentrations is also essential for ecosystem preservation;
then it has been demonstrated that these ions affect adversely the
fish and shellfish growth, water balance, blood oxygen carrying capacity,
osmoregulation, and so on.28 In the present
contribution, variations of the PO43– content were negligible, as reported previously by other authors.29,30 According to the pH of samples and zeta potential profiles of flocculants,
the surface of the flocculants are charged (Chitosan positively; BSF
negatively) and given that the HPO42– (predominant form of phosphate ions at the pH of the treated samples)
is also with negative charge, the adsorption of phosphates should
be favored by electrostatic attraction when chitosan is used. However,
the global chemical environment in these raw samples could complicate
the phosphate level reduction; thus, it is a challenging task to find
structure–property–function relationships toward flocculation
in field conditions. For sulfates, the removal mechanism is very similar
to the removal mechanism of phosphates; nonetheless, the adsorption
site may present selectivity for one of them.31 In our research, the bioflocculants employed were unable to remove
phosphates, sulfates, and nitrates, indicating the absence of adequate
adsorption sites for these ions. Although, a decrease in the concentration
of SO42– was detected (from 225 to 175
mg L–1) using BSF for the treatment of samples from
CCM. Turunen et al. also used chitosan for the removal of phosphorous
from agricultural wastes with different levels of phosphorus and turbidity,
but the phosphorous concentration was reduced only in high polluted
agricultural wastewater.32 Similar to our
results, these authors concluded that the bioflocculants are more
effective in high polluted water than in less polluted water.

On the other hand,
chitosan performed well in removing Fe in both
types of samples (ES and CCM). Metal ions were notably trapped by
the two bioflocculants, and the pH of the samples was also regulated
after the flocculation (close to 7). The commercial flocculant PAC
exhibited lower effectiveness in both tasks. In contrast with Chitosan
and BSF, it is clear that metal removal by binding to available sites
is less expected when PAC is the flocculant because of their differences
as chelating agents. This result highlighted that chitosan and BSF
are promising materials for wastewater treatment. A detailed discussion
about interactions between metal ions and flocculants is subsequently
presented using river water samples.

According to this study,
it is recommended that farm industries
should perform a treatment of their effluents before this hazardous
water is released into the environment. Thus, subsequent pollution
of natural resources, which still being contaminated by residual chemicals,
could be avoided. To this aim, authors consider that this contribution
provide a treatment strategy via direct bioflocculation that can be
easily adapted to the reality of these industries.

Turbidity and
Ion Removal from River Water Samples
Trials using urban river
water were carried out in order to evaluate
the flocculation behavior in the absence of agricultural wastes. Figure 8 displays the plots
of TR from Humaya River (29 NTU) and Tamazula River (32 NTU) at different
bioflocculant concentrations. It can be seen that BSF is a poor agent
for river water treatment; however, this material could be chemically
modified in a further work and with this possibly yielding better
results. Irrespective of the water samples, it was found that chitosan
allowed a high efficiency of turbidity reduction (final turbidity
< 5 NTU) at a dosage of 5 and 10 mg L–1. Thus,
an optimum chitosan dosage was registered as a minimum in the plot;
this is normally associated to an adequate number of flocculant chains
adsorbed in the particle surface, avoiding the solid restabilization
derived from insufficient polymer chains or surface saturation. Furthermore,
the Mexican Environmental Regulation for potable water (NOM-127-SSA1-1994)
establishes that water turbidity must be lower than 6 NTU, a parameter
easily controlled by chitosan. Besides, as previously reported for
river water samples, chitosan led to a comparable final turbidity
to that observed with commercial PAC.20 Additional experiments involving floc formation, solids redispersion
(breakage), and reformation were conducted, where the floc was completely
re-formed for both bioflocculants after the prescribed flocculation
time. According to the TR profiles and reformation experiments, the
flocculation mechanism of adsorption charge neutralization and sweep
flocculation were assumed for chitosan and BSF, respectively.14,16

Figure 8 TR

dosage. Sampling zones: (A) Humaya River (29 NTU) and (B) Tamazula
River (32 NTU).

Additionally, in order to assess
widely the effectiveness of both
bioflocculants, the settling rate was analyzed using river water samples
with different initial turbidity (Culiacan River: 38 and 66 NTU),
see Figure 9. It can
be appreciated that the effectiveness of BSF in removing turbidity
was highly dependent on the initial turbidity, and remarkable changes
in settling rate plot were observed from 30 min. A higher turbidity
of samples resulted in higher removal of colloids, where the removal
was close to 55% for initial turbidity of 66 NTU. On the other side,
chitosan performed well in the flocculation process irrespective of
the initial turbidity. Curiously, colloids removal was slightly improved
at 66 NTU as compared to 38 NTU. From Figure 9A, it is notable that floc formation started
after a few minutes. Nevertheless, chitosan worked slowly at the first
30 min when the initial turbidity was 66 NTU due to a major amount
of colloidal particles versus the same number of flocculant chains.

NTU) by comparing (A) chitosan (5 mg L–1) and (B)
BSF (30 mg L–1).

Table 2 shows average
values for several parameters of raw and treated urban river water.
Results of TR from this type of water were discussed earlier. In the
case of Humaya River, the pH of raw samples (pH = 8.39) was barely
within the range established by NOM-127-SSA1-1194 (pH from 6.5 to
8.5), whilst the Fe content in Tamazula River (0.238 mg L–1) was detected close to the permissible limit (0.300 mg L–1). It can be seen that after pollutants removal, the pH of both samples
was regulated to a more neutral value (close to 7) irrespective of
the bioflocculant type. Regarding anion removal, concentrations reported
as PO43– and SO42– remained without significant variation after the flocculation process
using chitosan and BSF; a similar behavior was previously discussed
for wastewater samples. Furthermore, according to our monitoring of
raw water, the concentrations of these anions were significantly lower
in river water. For metal ions, the entrapment of Fe and Mn in both
types of samples (Tamazula and Humaya rivers) was assessed. The good
performance of chitosan for the metal ion removal is attributed to
its functional groups, given that the mechanism involved during the
removal of Fe and Mn with chitosan is through chelation or complex
formation. Despite chelation being the predominant process for the
removal of these metals ions by forming coordinate covalent bonds
due to the amino groups, some hydroxyl groups may participate in coordination
by the release of protons.33 Hence, BSF
mainly removes Fe or Mn by coordination with the hydroxyl groups.
This result highlighted that chitosan is a promising material for
turbidity and metal removal during the production of potable water.
Specially, it is mandatory to have low concentration of hazardous
metals, which are very common contaminants of water. In the case of
Fe and Mn, they can be leached out from their bearing rocks to the
water or be discharged to the water from industrial activity; an excess
of Fe and Mn can cause some inconvenience like giving metallic taste
to drinking water, and these metals also tend to affect the health
of the human body because of their gradual accumulation.34,35

In the case of Mn,
it was previously reported that the concentration
of this ion in Humaya River is eventually higher than the levels established
in Mexican laws,20 being a problem in potabilization
plants of Culiacan (Mexico) during the production of colorless water,
and the population demand of a higher quality service. However, the
concentration of detected Mn was within the range of permissible limits.
Hence, some trials were carried out using low turbidity river water
(Tamazula River, pH close to 7.5) as a matrix for the preparation
of synthetic samples with a higher content of Mn by adding manganese
salt, obtaining the following concentration: (A) 0.120, (B) 0.170,
(C) 0.280, (D) 0.374, and (E) 0.424 mg L–1. From Figure 10, it can be observed
that the effectiveness of BSF in Mn removal was improved as the metal
concentration increased; while chitosan resulted to be an efficient
material that triggered a flocculation process involving a higher
metal concentration removal. Chitosan resulted in river water with
Mn content within the levels required by Mexican laws (<0.15 mg
L–1). The performance varied depending mainly on
the bioflocculant nature, which could be related to the preference
of this metal for complex formation (Mn2+ prefers six-coordinated
complex structures).36 Hence, the interaction
via the coordinate bond was apparently more suitable between metal
ions and chitosan. This polysaccharide contains both amino and hydroxyl
groups that can bind to metal ions, whilst BSF comprises proteins,
lipids, and carbohydrates, among other components, resulting in diverse
functional groups. Besides, it was previously assumed that chelation
is the predominant process for metal removal, with chitosan being
a better chelating agent because of its particular intrinsic properties.

Figure 10 Manganese
removal from synthetic samples using river water matrix
(15 NTU). Flocculant concentrations: chitosan (5 mg L–1) and BSF (30 mg L–1). Manganese concentrations:
(A) 0.120, (B) 0.170, (C) 0.280, (D) 0.374, and (E) 0.424 mg L–1.

On the other hand, pH
is an important factor in the sorption procedure
because it influences the capability of the Mn2+ ions to
dissolve, the amount of ionization of the adsorbate and also the quantity
of counter-ions on the adsorbent that contains the functional groups.
Commonly, the Mn removal is reduced at lower pH due to the competition
between protons (H+) and Mn2+ for the adsorption
site.37 When the pH increases the Mn removal
increases reaching a maximum value at pH 7; at greater pH values,
the Mn removal decreases. Thus, the matrix from Tamazula River presented
appropriate pH (between 7 and 8) for Mn removal. In addition, from
zeta potential profiles of chitosan (at pH between 6.5 and 8.5) and
BSF (at pH < 6), it was supposed that both materials should exhibit
nonelectrostatic interactions with pollutants because of ζ close
to zero.

Furthermore, experiments using samples based on the
above-mentioned
water matrix and copper salt were conducted. For that, synthetic samples
having concentrations of 1.35 and 2.75 mg L–1 of
Cu were treated. BSF exhibits a low efficiency in copper entrapment,
whereas chitosan allowed the removal of around 50% of this metal from
both samples. Based on calculations,38 the
effectiveness in Cu removal is affected by the ligand nature, and
the formation of octahedral complexes is preferred when the metallic
center is the ion Cu2+. According to the results with samples
containing 2.75 mg L–1 of Cu, chitosan can help
in the production of potable water with copper content within the
levels required by Mexican laws (<2.0 mg L–1).

Conclusions
Chitosan and BSF represent eco-friendly materials,
which could
be used in wastewater treatment plants via direct flocculation. This
study demonstrated that chitosan exhibited high effectiveness in the
removal of different pollutants regardless the water composition (types
of wastewater and river water) in field conditions. Our results also
showed that the flocculation mechanism, being adsorption charge neutralization
or sweep flocculation, was dependent on the initial water quality.
The use of this bioflocculant resulted in turbidity levels and heavy
metal concentrations within the limits established by the Mexican
Environmental Regulation (NOM-127-SSA1-1194). On the other hand, the
proposed byproduct BSF, renewable and sustainable material, exhibited
a high effectiveness in direct flocculation using hazardous samples
(CCM). For these samples, the performance of BSF was remarkably competitive
with the results reached using chitosan, and both bioflocculants were
notably better than the commercial PAC for pH regulation and Fe removal.
Additionally for synthetic samples, BSF was able to trap a high amount
of Mn (close to 40%) from river water matrix when the Mn content was
0.424 mg L–1. Irrespective of the water type, BSF
triggered a mechanism of sweep flocculation. Based on complementary
trials, flocculation using the byproduct corn straw flour was not
successful. Hence, BSF contains some chemical entities that play a
key role during the flocculation process. Although chitosan performed
better for water remediation, the price involved using chitosan is
higher than the cost with BSF. Besides, future chemical modification
of BSF could enhance its flocculation performance in a variety of
samples. On the other hand, agricultural wastes as bioflocculants
represent a potential solution that the farmers should apply in their
own wastewater in order to mitigate contamination before their wastes
reach rivers and lakes. Thus, this contribution provides relevant
data to be exploited in environmental technologies and industrial
sustainability.

Experimental Section
Materials
Chitosan
with a medium molecular weight was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Mexico). Chitin origin: shrimp shells;
form: powder; molecular weight: 190–310 kDa; degree of deacetylation:
75–85%. Chitosan was used from aqueous solution (1% acetic
acid) at 5000 mg L–1. The BSF was prepared from
the bean straw (P. vulgaris L.), an
agricultural byproduct, which was collected directly from the farm
after bean harvest in Sinaloa, Mexico. The straw was triturated for
size reduction and sieved through both 250 and 425 μm pore sieves,
and chemical modification using hazardous reagents was avoided. The
proximate composition of the flour comprised ash (9%), protein (3%),
lipids (0.2%), carbohydrate (47%), crude fiber (36%), and moisture
(4.8%). PAC, commercial grade, was provided by the Water Supply and
Sewerage Board of Culiacan, Mexico, and used as received. The characteristics
of the PAC are yellow powder; Al2O3 close to
30%; density of 1.2 (20 °C); pH within the range 3.5–5.0.

Agricultural wastewater samples were taken from CCM (24°34′4.78″
N, 107°26′39.36″ W), LE (25°26′51.8″
N 108°11′15.0″ W), and ES (23°54′03.9″
N, 106°49′59.2″ W) in Sinaloa, Mexico. Wastes from
CCM drainage are a mixture composed of dairy shed effluents, agricultural
wastewater, and domestic wastewater, whilst effluents from LE and
ES are derived of agricultural activity. River water samples were
taken from Humaya River (24°49′3.58″ N, 107°24′15.54″
W), Tamazula River (24°48′57.32″ N, 107°23′9.13″
W), and Culiacan River (24°48′35.33″ N, 107°24′25.3″
W), which are urban rivers used as supply sources for water potabilization
plants in Sinaloa, Mexico.

Jar-Test
All experiments were performed
by using a
PB 700 Standard Jar-Floc Tester with six mixers (Phipps and Bird)
at 25 °C. The procedure was followed according to the literature.20 Briefly, glass beakers were filled with 500
mL of the water sample, and then an appropriated volume of flocculant–coagulant
was added to each beaker followed by mixing thoroughly via mechanical
stirring at 100 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the shaking speed was
slowed at 60 rpm and maintained for 30 min; afterward, the mechanical
stirring was stopped, and the sediment settlement and consolidation
were studied for a prescribed time of 25 min. Samples were then collected
in the upper part of the beaker to measure the various analytical
parameters of the effluent. The pH of the solution was not adjusted
prior to the addition of the flocculant. Flocs and the aqueous phase
were separated through decantation. In this test, flocculant concentrations
and flocculation time were studied.

Characterization
Dynamic light scattering was used
to determine the zeta potential (ζ) of dispersed materials.
Measurements were carried out at 25 °C using a Zetasizer (NanoZS)
from Malvern Instruments (ZEN3690) equipped with a red laser (λ
= 630 nm). Turbidity was measured using a Hach 2100N turbidimeter
having a stable halogen-filled tungsten filament lamp, at a temperature
of 25 °C. The concentration of heavy metal and anions of interest
was estimated with a Photometer HANNA-Instruments HI-83200; analyses
were performed according to the methods specified in the instruction
manual and at 25 °C. Data of pH and TDS of samples were recorded
from Thermo Scientific Orion Star Meters.
