In this study, N-(((2-((2-aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)methyl)-4-sulfamoylbenzamide
was impregnated into the hydrous zirconium oxide matrix to yield N-(((2-((2-aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)methyl)-4-sulfamoylbenzamide/hydrous
zirconium oxide composite (AESB/HZO). The composite material was used
to remove Ni(II) from aqueous environment. AESB/HZO was characterized
using Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy with
energy dispersive X-ray, and thermogravimetry–differential
thermal analyses. An experimental design approach was utilized to
model and optimize the variables of adsorption of Ni(II) onto the
AESB/HZO composite. Four experimental parameters were selected as
independent variables: contact time, pH, adsorbent dose, and initial
Ni(II) concentration. A multivariable experimental design was used
to establish quadratic model to describe the relationship between
percent removal of Ni(II) and four independent variables. At the optimum
conditions (contact time: 85 min, pH: 6, adsorbent dose: 10 mg/20
mL, and initial Ni(II) concentration: 20 mg L–1),
high removal efficiency (99.35%) was achieved, which is reasonably
well predicted by the quadratic model. The sorption of Ni(II) is dependent
on pH and ionic strength at pH < 6.0. At low pH, −NH and
−NH2 groups are protonated, whereas the −SO2– group is available for binding with Ni(II) and the
sorption of Ni(II) is mainly governed by outer sphere surface complexation.
In the pH range 6.0–7.5, −NH, −NH2, and −SO2– groups are available for binding
with Ni(II) and the sorption is mainly governed by inner-sphere surface
complexation. Adsorption isotherm data fitted well to the Langmuir
model and the maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 96.03 mg
g–1 at 303 K. The results of present investigation
demonstrated that AESB/HZO has a good potential for Ni(II) removal
from aqueous solution.

==== Body
Introduction
Many industrial processes release effluents
containing heavy metal
ions/and other pollutants into aquatic environment, which present
a threat to the human health due to their toxicity and accumulation
in human organisms.1 Nickel is a toxic
heavy metal, which is associated with a large number of industrial
applications such as electroplating, mining, printing, batteries,
metal finishing, silver refineries, phosphate fertilizers, coinage,
food processing, and pulp and paper.2−5 These industries release nickel into the
environment.6,7 The maximum concentration of total
nickel allowed by WHO8 and Bureau of Indian
Standards9 is 70 and 20 μg L–1 Ni(II) in drinking water, respectively. The pollution
caused by nickel has been reported from across the world including
Asia.10−14 Strict environmental regulations on the discharge of heavy metals
have forced to treat the wastewater and bring the level of heavy metals
content under permissible limit.

Several approaches have been
utilized for removal of Ni(II) from
water and wastewater, which include nanofiltration,15 coagulation–flocculation,16 electrocoagulation,17 electroflotation,18 ion exchange,19 photocatalytic
removal,20 adsorption,21 and so forth. Among these treatment technologies, adsorption
is recognized as a highly potential process for removal of Ni(II)
from wastewater. Activated carbon has been found as an efficient adsorbent
for the removal of different types of pollutants including heavy metal
ions.22 Activated carbon obtained from
different sources such as graphite,23 Nigerian
bamboo,24 doum palm seed,25 cucumis melo peel,26 olive stone,27 and rice husk28 has
been used as sorbent for removal of Ni(II) from aqueous systems.

Inorganic–organic hybrid materials have been examined as
potential adsorbents for the removal of toxic cationic and anionic
species from water and wastewater.29−33 Recently, some critical reviews dealing with layered
double hydroxide-based nanomaterials,34 polymer-based nanocomposites,35 and metal
organic framework-based materials36 for
removal of radionuclides, heavy metal ions, and toxic metal ions have
appeared. Silica gels (MCM-41) functionalized with aminopropyl group,37 poly (ethyleneimine),38 and 2-((1H-pyrrol-2-yl) methylene) hydrazine carbothioamide39 were employed as adsorbents for removal of Ni(II)
from aqueous solution. Carboxymethyl-chitosan deposited onto functionalized
Aerosil 200 silica particles and colloidal silica were used as an
effective adsorbents40,41 for retention of Ni(II) from
aqueous solution.

The conventional one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT)
approach has been
utilized most frequently to optimize the adsorption processes.42−44 However, the OVAT approach does not consider the interactions between
the variables of the adsorption processes and requiring large number
of experimental runs. The application of experimental design in the
optimization of adsorption processes makes it feasible to achieve
maximum useful information through fewer experiments. Response surface
methodology (RSM) can derive an empirical model, which includes the
most important variables and their effects. More recently, RSM based
on Box–Behnken design has been utilized for optimization of
Cd(II) removal using poly (o-phenylenediamine)/hydrous
zirconium oxide.45 In addition, central
composite design (CCD) with RSM has been applied to optimize the conditions
for maximum removal of Zn(II) from contaminated soil.46

In this study, N-(((2-((2-aminoethyl)amino)ethyl)amino)methyl)-4-sulfamoylbenzamide
impregnated hydrous zirconium oxide (AESB/HZO) was synthesized and
characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
analysis, and thermogravimetry–differential thermal analyses
(TGA–DTA). RSM combined with CCD was employed to design and
optimize the removal of Ni(II) from aqueous solution by AESB/HZO.
The adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed by different isotherm
models.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
The FTIR spectrum
of HZO (Figure 1a)
displayed absorption
bands peaking at 3371 and 16 23 cm–1, which correspond
to stretching vibration of O–H of coordinated water and H–O–H
bending vibration, respectively.47 The
absorption band observed at 1402 cm–1 is resulting
from the O–H bending vibration from Zr–OH.48 The absorption band centered at 670 cm and 474
cm–1 indicated the lattice vibration of Zr–O.49 The FTIR spectrum of AESB/HZO is shown in Figure 1b. The bands observed
at 1413 and 1105 cm–1 are assigned to the asymmetric
and symmetric stretching modes of O=S=O group, respectively.50 The band peaking at 1051 cm–1 indicated C–S stretching vibration along with the ring vibration.51 The band observed at 928 cm–1 is assigned to S–N stretching vibration.52 A broad band within 3500–3300 cm–1 is assigned to N–H stretching vibration. The absorption band
centered at 1644 cm–151 indicated the amide C=O stretching vibration. The band observed
at 1567 cm–1 corresponds to aromatic in-plane stretching.51 The bands 644 and 527 cm–1 correspond to Zr–N and Zr–O stretching vibration,
respectively. The surface morphology of AESB/HZO was characterized
by SEM. The SEM image (Figure 1c) revealed the presence of pores of varying dimensions. Figure 1d shows the energy-dispersive
system (EDS) peaks corresponding to carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur,
and zirconium, which confirmed the synthesis of AESB/HZO.

of HZO; (b) FTIR spectrum of AESB/HZO; (c) SEM
image of AESB/HZO; (d) EDS spectrum of AESB/HZO; and (e) TGA and DTA
curves of AESB/HZO.

The TGA curve (Figure 1e) shows a steep
slope between 50 and 130 °C with mass
loss of 11.34%, which corresponds to the loss of H2O molecules.
The number of water molecules was calculated using the equation53,54 1  where n is the number of
water molecules; X and M are the
percent weight loss and molecular weight of compound, respectively.
The number of water molecule was found to be 3.28. The DTA curve exhibited
an endothermic peak at 88.92 °C, which also confirmed the loss
of water molecules. The anhydrous AESB/HZO shows decomposition from
130 to 250 °C with a mass loss of 17.48%. This loss in weight
may be due to the decomposition of sulfonamide group.55 The second step decomposition was observed from 250 to
390 °C with 31.37% weight loss, which may be due to decomposition
of benzamide group. In third step, the degradation occurs from 390
to 590 °C with 25.71% weight loss, which may be due to decomposition
of remaining organic moiety. Lastly, the weight loss was observed
from 590 to 650 °C. At 650 °C, the material is converted
to zirconium oxide.

RSM and Model Fitting
The experimental
results in terms
of percentage removal of Ni(II) obtained from 30 runs of CCD are presented
in Table 1. The experimental
data were fitted to different regression models (Table 2). The quadratic model was selected
as the best model on the basis of low p-value (0.0001)
and high values of F, adjusted R2, and predicted R2. The relationship
between the percentage removal and independent variables can be described
by the following quadratic equation 2

Analysis of variance was carried out to assess the
quality and
significance of the quadratic model (Table 3). The values of F and p are 1770.610 and 0.0001, respectively, which indicated
that the model is highly significant. The lack of fit is insignificant
which confirms the good predictability of the model. The value of
determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9994)
as shown by ANOVA also indicated that the fitting is very well and
only 0.06% of the total variation was not explained by the model.
The high value of adjusted R2 (0.9988)
indicated the high significance of the proposed model. The relationship
between the experimental values and the predicted values of percent
removal of Ni(II) obtained from eq 2 is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen in Figure 2 that the developed model is adequate because
the residuals are very close to the diagonal line. Figure 3 shows the normal probability
plot of studentized residuals for Ni(II) removal by AESB/HZO. A normal
probability plot suggests that if the residual follows the normal
distribution, the points will lie on a straight line. Figure 3 shows that few data points
are scattered from the straight line. Now it is assumed that the data
are normally distributed as no transformation is required. In this
study, independent variables such as contact time (X1),
pH (X2), adsorbent dose (X3), and Ni(II) concentration
(X4) are highly significant parameters with p < 0.0001. Moreover, the second order effects such as contact
time (X12), pH (X22),
adsorbent dose (X32), and Ni(II) concentration(X42) are also significant as p <
0.0001. In addition, the interaction between factors such as X1X2, X1X3, X1X4, X2X3, X2X4,
and X3X4 are significant as the value of p < 0.0001. The negative coefficient of quadratic term
in the polynomial expression pointed toward negative effect on the
removal efficiency. Adequate precision, measure of the signal to noise
ratio, was found to be 147.84. The adequate precision values greater
than 4.0 pointed toward the adequacy of signal and also confirmed
the good prediction by the model designed by CCD.

Effect of Parameters on Responses
The 3D plots for
removal of Ni(II) versus two variables were obtained while keeping
other variables constant at the center level. The combined effect
of pH and contact time on percent removal of Ni(II) is shown in Figure 4a, which revealed
that at any fixed pH, removal efficiency increases with contact time.
The maximum removal (99.35%) was obtained at a contact time of 85
min. The interactive effect of contact time and adsorbent dose, keeping
pH 6 and initial concentration of 20 mg L–1 constant,
on percent removal is shown in Figure 4b. The increase in adsorbent dose and contact time
causes increase in removal efficiency, which is due to the increase
in surface area and binding sites provided by greater amounts of AESB/HZO. Figure 4c shows the interactive
effect of contact time and initial Ni(II) concentration (constant
pH and adsorbent dose). It can be seen that the removal efficiency
increases with increasing initial concentration at any given contact
time. The combined effect of pH and adsorbent dose (Figure 4d) revealed that the removal
efficiency increases with increasing adsorbent dose at any fixed pH
value. The removal efficiency decreases at pH less than 6 which may
be due to protonation of −NH group in AESB and formation of
ZrOOH+. The interactive effect of pH and initial Ni(II)
concentration (Figure 4e) revealed that the removal efficiency increases with increase in
pH up to 6 at an initial concentration of 20 mg L–1. Further increase in initial concentration causes a decrease in
removal efficiency which is due to the non-availability of sufficient
number of binding sites for Ni(II). The combined effect of adsorbent
dose and initial concentration on the removal of Ni(II) (Figure 4f) suggested a decrease
in removal efficiency at lower amounts of adsorbent dose which is
due to non-availability of binding sites for Ni(II).

concentration and contact time, (d) adsorbent dose and pH, (e) initial
concentration and pH, and (f) initial concentration and adsorbent
dose.

Effect of pH and Ionic
Strength
Figure 5 shows the effect of pH on Ni(II) sorption
in 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mol L–1 NaCl solutions.
The sorption increases with increasing pH and attaining the maximum
sorption in the pH range 6.0–7.5. At pH > 7.5, the decreasing
trend in sorption was observed. Sorption of Ni(II) in 0.1 mol L–1 NaCl solution is slightly higher as compared to 0.001
mol L–1 NaCl solution at pH < 6.0. The maximum
sorption was found in the pH range 6.0–7.5 which was independent
of NaCl solution. At pH > 7.5, no difference was observed in the
sorption
curves in three different solutions. At pH < 6.0. The sorption
of Ni(II) on AESB/HZO depends on the ionic strength and pH of medium.
At lower pH, the −NH and −NH2 groups present
in the adsorbent are protonated, whereas the −SO2– group is available for binding with Ni(II). This resulted
in decrease in sorption efficiency. Moreover, this finding revealed
that the sorption of Ni(II) on AESB/HZO is mainly governed by outer
sphere surface complexation. In pH range 6.0–7.5, ionic strength
did not affect the sorption of Ni(II) on AESB/HZO and the functional
groups such as −NH, −NH2, and −SO2– are available for binding with Ni(II). This suggested
that sorption of Ni(II) is governed mainly by inner sphere surface
complexation.56,57

NaCl solutions.

Optimization of Variables
The numerical optimization
was carried out by assigning a minimum and maximum level to each input
variables, whereas the response was designed to achieve the maximum. Figure 6 shows the range
of input variables obtained from the model. RSM with desirability
function has assigned the optimum values to each variable as follows:
contact time: 85 min, pH: 6, adsorbent dose: 10 mg/20 mL, and initial
Ni(II) concentration: 20 mg L–1. Experiments were
also performed under optimization conditions. The results agreed well
with the predicted value.

functions

Isotherm Models
Adsorption data were analyzed by using
Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
models. The linear form of Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich
isotherm equations are presented in eqs 3–6, respectively 3   4   5   6  where Ce and qe are the
equilibrium concentration of Ni(II)
ions in solution (mg L–1) and amount of Ni(II) adsorbed
(mg g–1) at equilibrium, respectively; qm is the theoretical monolayer maximum sorption capacity
(mg g–1); KL is the
Langmuir isotherm constant (L mg–1); KF and n are Freundlich isotherm constant
related to adsorption capacity and intensity, respectively. β
and AT are the Temkin constant related
to heat of adsorption (J mol–1) and equilibrium
binding constant (L mg–1), respectively. Kad is the Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
constant. qs is the theoretical isotherm
saturation capacity (mg g−1 ).

The plots for
Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm
models are shown in Figures 7–10. Table 4 shows the isotherm parameters for each model, which were
calculated from the corresponding isotherm plots. On the basis of R2 values, the order of best fit was Langmuir
> Temkin > Dubinin–Radushkevich > Freundlich model
at all temperatures
(303, 313, and 323K). The error functions such as χ2 and APE were calculated with respect to the experimental adsorption
capacity. In case of the Langmuir isotherm model, the values of χ2 and APE are the lowest, and hence, this model explained the
adsorption of Ni(II) onto AESB/HZO more accurately as compared to
the other model.

a The experimental values of adsorption
capacity (qe) for Ni(II) are 96.20, 102.18,
and 104.84 mg g–1 at 303, 313, and 323 K, respectively.

Conclusions
In
this study, the AESB/HZO composite material was prepared, which
showed excellent potential for the removal of Ni(II) from aqueous
solutions. The result showed that AESBH/ZO has high Ni(II) removal
efficiency (99.35%) from water. The oxygen and nitrogen-containing
functional groups present in the adsorbent could form strong surface
complexes with Ni(II). The characterization of the composite material
was performed through FTIR, SEM with EDX, and TGA–DTA. The
experimental parameters for the removal of Ni(II) were optimized using
CCD. The experimental data were analyzed by Langmuir, Freundlich,
Temkin, and Dubinin–Radushkevich isotherm models. On the basis
of error analysis, it was found that the Langmuir isotherm model is
able to explain the adsorption of Ni(II) more accurately.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Zirconium(IV) oxychloride octahydrate (Otto
Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India), ammonia solution (25%; Merck Life Science,
India), triethylenetetramine (Merck Life Science, India), carboxybenzene
sulfonamide (Himedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. India), and benzene boronic
acid (Merck Life Science, India) were used for the synthesis of the
adsorbent. Nickel chloride hexahydrate (Extrapure; Loba Chemie Pvt.
Ltd., India) was used to prepare standard solution.

Preparation
of AESB/HZO
The synthesis of the adsorbent
(AESB/HZO) was carried out in three steps. First, hydrous zirconium(IV)
oxide (HZO) gel was prepared by mixing equal volumes of 0.10 M zirconium(IV)
oxychloride octahydrate and 6% ammonium hydroxide. Second, triethylenetetramine
was added to the HZO gel and stirred on a magnetic stirrer for 4 h
at room temperature. Lastly, HZO gel treated with triethylenetetramine
was mixed with 4-carboxybenzene sulfonamide and benzene boronic acid
(5 mol %) and refluxed for 1 h. The gel was filtered, washed with
distilled water, followed by ethanol, and then dried in an oven at
40 °C. The dried material was immersed in distilled water to
get small granules and then sieved to obtain granules of uniform size
(50–100 μm). Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of AEBS/HZO.

Triethylenetetramine Hydrous Zirconium Oxide (TTHZO).
(b): Synthesis of AESB/HZO
Characterization
FTIR spectra were recorded over the
range 4000–400 cm–1 on an FTIR spectrophotometer
(PerkinElmer Inc., spectrum 2, USA) using the KBr pellet approach.
The surface morphology of the material was characterized by SEM images,
which were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-6510
LV, Japan), and elemental composition was measured with EDX mappings.
TGA and DTA were performed using a DTG-60H thermal analyzer (Shimadzu,
Japan). A water bath shaker (NSW Pvt. Ltd., India) was employed to
monitor the temperature and shaking speed.

Experimental Design and
Optimization by RSM
RSM, a
combination of statistical and mathematical approaches, is used for
modeling and optimization of process variables to obtain the best
response.58,59 In this study, RSM based on CCD was applied
to optimize the adsorption of Ni(II) onto AESB/HZO. The independent
factors such as contact time (X1), pH (X2),
adsorbent dose (X3), and initial concentration of Ni(II)
(X4) were selected on the basis of initial experiments.
Each factor was studied at five levels namely −α, −1,
0, +1, and +α as lowest, low, center, high, and highest, respectively. Table 5 shows the range and
levels of each factor. CCD consists of 2k factorial runs, 8 axial runs, and 6 at the center point. The total
number of experimental runs required to build CCD matrix can be obtained
from the following equation 7  where N, k, and Cp are the total number of experimental
runs, number of variables, and number of replicate at the center point,
respectively. In this study, 30 experimental runs are required for
four independent variables. The matrix of CCD and experimental results
are given in Table 1. The optimization of variables of adsorption process involves three
steps(i) First, the statistically designed
experiments were performed.

(ii) Second, the coefficients of the mathematical
model were determined.

(iii) Lastly, the response was predicted
from mathematical model and confirming the adequacy of the model.

The experimental data from CCD were subjected to multiregression
analysis and the predicted percent removal can be calculated by the
second order (quadratic) polynomial equation in terms of coded factors
as 8  where Y and β0 are the predicted
response [% removal of Ni(II)] and model constant,
respectively. βi, βii, and βij are
the linear, quadratic, and interaction coefficients, respectively.
Xi and Xj represents
the coded variables of experiments and ε is the error of prediction.

All data were processed by Design Expert (free trial 11.1.0.1 version).
Analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significant and insignificant
terms in the equation fitted. The robustness of the model was assessed
based on R2, adjusted R2, and predicted R2. The optimum
values of the variables were estimated by showing the regression equation
and examining the response surface plots.

Adsorption Experiments
The adsorption of Ni(II) onto
AESB/HZO was carried out in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks according to
CCD using batch experiments. The required amount of adsorbent was
added to 20 mL of Ni(II) solution (4–36 mg L–1). The pH was adjusted from 2–10 with dilute solution of HCl
or NaOH. The resulting solutions were agitated at 160 rpm for the
required time in a water bath shaker. For determination of maximum
adsorption capacity, 10 mg of the adsorbent was added to 20 mL of
Ni(II) solution (20 mg L–1) adjusted to pH 6 and
the resulting mixture was agitated in a water bath shaker (160 rpm)
for 85 min. The samples were filtered and the concentration of Ni(II)
in the filtrate was determined by AAS. All experiments were performed
in triplicate and the average values were reported. The amount of
Ni(II) adsorbed at equilibrium, qe (mg
g–1) and percentage removal of Ni(II) were calculated
using the following equations 9   10  where Ci and Ce are the initial and equilibrium
concentration of Ni(II) in mg L–1, respectively; V is the volume of solution (L); and M is
the mass of the adsorbent (g).
