An original method has been developed
for the synthesis of 1,3-dyine
derivatives of natural lembehyne B in high yields (50–67%)
and with high selectivity (>98%). The key stage of the synthesis
is
new Ti-catalyzed cross-cyclomagnesiation of oxygenated and aliphatic
1,2-dienes induced by Grignard reagents. For studying the effect of
the structure on the antitumor and neuritogenic activities, a series
of lembehyne B analogues with different distances between the terminal
hydroxy group and the 1,3-diyne moiety was prepared and tested for
neuritogenic activity on mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells and for
cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and effects on the cell cycle
using Jurkat, U937, K562, HeLa, and Hek293 tumor cell lines.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Higher acetylenic alcohols and their derivatives are encountered
in many plants, algae, marine invertebrates, and higher fungus species,1−8 and more than 1000 acetylenic compounds have been isolated and identified
to date. For many years, increasing interest has been shown in these
organic compounds, largely owing to the important biological activities
they exhibit, in particular, antitumor, antimicrobial, antiparasitic,
antibacterial, antifungal, and other types of activities.4−16

Among the diverse alkynol derivatives known to date, derivatives
of carbinols containing one or several triple bonds in the α-position
to the hydroxy group are the most abundant.1−5

In addition, it has been shown
by Japanese researchers that higher
alkynols, lembehynes A–C, containing bis-methylene-separated
Z-double bonds in the molecules, isolated in nanoconcentrations from
Indonesian sea sponges Haliclona sp., show a high
neuritogenic activity against mouse neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells and
rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells.17−20

Therefore, these compounds
can be considered as the base for the
development of modern drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
Huntington’s chorea and so on).

Meanwhile, studies along
this line were considerably held up by
the exceptionally low content of lembehynes in sea sponges and the
lack of efficient methods for their total synthesis. Therefore, we
developed original stereoselective approaches both for the preparation
of key monomers and for the total synthesis of lembehynes A and B21−24 using the Ti-catalyzed cross-cyclomagnesiation of oxygenated and
aliphatic 1,2-dienes on treatment with Grignard reagents, which we
discovered.25−27 In addition, it was shown for the first time by flow
cytometry that lembehyne B can induce early apoptosis in various types
of leukemia cells.22

As a continuation
of the studies dealing with stereoselective synthetic
routes to lembehyne derivatives and the influence of their structure
on the antitumor and neuritogenic activities, here, we report a stereoselective
method for the synthesis of lembehyne B 1,3-diyne derivatives, close
structural analogues of natural strongylodiols,28−30 pellynols,31 and halicynones,32 which exhibit a broad range of biological activities. In addition,
we planned to pay particular attention to testing of the antitumor
and neuritogenic activities of the compounds by means of modern flow
cytometry and phase-contrast microscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Chemistry
According
to the previously
developed scheme for the preparation of racemic lembehyne B,21 we first prepared (13Z,17Z)-tetraconta-13,17-dienal (4) in a 79% yield
by cross-cyclomagnesiation of 1,2-nonadediene (1) and
2-tetradeca-12,13-dien-1-yl-1,3-dioxolane (2) on treatment
with EtMgBr in the presence of Mg metal and a catalytic amount of
Cp2TiCl2 (10 mol %) (1/2/EtMgBr/Mg/[Ti] = 12:10:30:20:0.1, Et2O, 20–22
°C, 7 h) (Scheme 1). This was followed by a successive reaction of aldehyde 4 with presynthesized 1-lithium-4-trimethylsilyl-1,3-butadiyne and
removal of the trimethylsilyl group on treatment with trimethylbutylammonium
fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give the target 1,3-diyne
rac-lembehyne B analogue 6 in ∼66% yield (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Racemic
1,3-Diyne’s Lembehyne B Derivative 6
Subsequently, we developed a synthetic route
to 1,3-diyne derivatives
of natural lembehyne B with the R-configuration of
the hydroxy group by the direct addition of 1-bromoalkynes to lembehyne
B22 synthesized from aldehyde 4 according to Scheme 2:

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 1,3-Diyne’s Analogues 11 and 12a–d on the Basis of Natural Lembehyne
B (10)
First, racemic 8 and natural lembehyne B (10) were synthesized
according to a previously developed scheme21−24 by the successive addition of
lithium trimethylsilylacetylenide
to aldehyde 4, deprotection of the resulting alkyne 7, oxidation of alcohol 8, and stereoselective
reduction of ketone 9 at the final step. The reactions
of natural lembehyne B (10) with 1-bromo-2-trimethylsilylacetylene
or 1-bromo-2-(ω-hydroxyalkyl)acetylenes in the presence of CuCl
afforded the target 1,3-diyne lembehyne B derivatives 11 and 12a–d in high yields.

In the second
stage, we initiated a study of antitumor and neuritogenic
activities of the synthesized 1,3-diynes in comparison with those
of the initial lembehyne B.

2.2 Biology
The cytotoxicity
of lymbehynes
B and their derivatives (altogether six compounds) was evaluated using
a flow cytofluorimeter and a Guava ViaCount kit (Millipore). The following
cell lines were studied: Jurkat (human T-lymphoblastic leukemia),
K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia), U937 (human histiocytic
lymphoma), HeLa (human cervical carcinoma), Hek293 (human embryonic
kidney cells), and Neuro 2A cells. The neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cell
line of mice (albino) is a convenient model to study the mechanisms
of neuronal differentiation and the action of neurotrophic factors.

We tested two 1,3-diyne derivatives 6 and 11 based on the racemic and natural lembehyne B and four ω-hydroxy-1,3-diyne
lembehyne B (10) derivatives (12a–d) with different distances between the hydroxy group and the 1,3-diyne
moiety. Cytotoxicity assays of these compounds against Jurkat, K562,
U937, and HeLa tumor cells and Hek293 embryonic cells showed that
1,3-diyne 6 based on racemic lembehyne B has a somewhat
lower cytotoxic activity against these cell lines than its analogue 11 synthesized using natural lembehyne B. The highest cytotoxicity
was found for compound 12c, the cytotoxicity of which
was higher for suspension cultures (Jurkat, K562, U937) than for adhesion
cultures (Table 1).

The lembehyne B derivatives at a
concentration of 0.60 μM/mL
induced apoptosis of 87% of Jurkat tumor cells (Figure 1A), 15% being early apoptosis (Q7-4) and
more than 71% being late apoptosis (Q7-2).

Figure 1 Jurkat cells treated
with different concentrations of compound 12c (1) were
double-stained with annexin V/PI and analyzed
by flow cytometry. (A) 0.6 μM; (B) 0.4 μM; (C) 0.2 μM;
(D) 0.1 μM; (E) control. Q7-1, necrotic cells; Q7-2, late apoptotic
cells; Q7-3, living cells; Q7-4, early apoptotic cells.

Thus, lembehyne B derivatives show a dose-dependent influence
on
the cell population and induce early and late apoptosis; meanwhile,
the initial lembehyne B has been previously shown to induce, most
of all, early apoptosis.22

Figure 2 shows the
results of the study of the cell cycle phases for Jurkat cells carried
out by flow cytometry within 24 h after the cells were treated with
compound 12c at various concentrations.

Figure 2 Cell cycle analysis in
Jurkat cells after incubation with compound 12c at different
concentrations for 24 h. (A) 0.6 μM;
(B) 0.4 μM; (C) 0.2 μM; (D) 0.1 μM; (E) untreated
cells.

The Jurkat, K562, U937, HeLa,
and Hek293 cell cycle characteristics
in the control samples showed a considerable predominance of cells
in the G0–G1 phase and a balance between the synthesis (S phase)
and apoptosis (sub-G0–G1) processes.

Within 24 h after
exposure to compound 12c, virtually
in all tumor cell lines, most of all in the suspension Jurkat, K562,
and U937 cells, apoptosis processes predominated (increased sub-G0–G1
stage), with retained or even somewhat enhanced ability of cells to
DNA synthesis (S phase). This was accompanied by a decreasing fraction
of cells in the G0–G1 phase, together with an increasing proliferation
block and a decreasing proliferation index due to a decrease in the
number of cells in the G2 + M phase (Figure 2A).

All of the foregoing may be indicative
of the cytotoxic activity
of compound 12c against chronic myeloid, T-cell leukemia,
and histiocytic lymphoma cells caused by the ability of these compounds
to induce apoptosis.

A comparison of the data on the effects
of natural lembehyne B
and its 1,3-diyne analogue 12c on the cell cycle showed
some differences. Whereas lembehyne B mainly arrests the cell cycle
in the G1 phase, apart from the accumulation of hypodiploid cells
(G0), the 1,3-diyne analogues directly affect the S phase by stopping
it and decreasing the G2 cell population, which also finally contributes
to the hypodiploid cell population.

Like other derivatives that
we studied, compound 12c stimulated the growth of neurites
in the Neuro 2A cell culture;
however, unlike other compounds, 12c showed a very high
differentiating activity toward neuroblastoma cells, which was manifested
even at low concentrations (Figure 3 and Table 1). When the time of cell incubation with 1,3-diyne 12c increased, the differentiation was enhanced and neurite branching
and elongation took place (Figure 3). The advantage of the neurite branching and length
for the cells incubated in the medium with compound 12c can be clearly seen in Figure 3. In other words, compound 12c may prove
to be not inferior in activity to neuro growth factor (NGF); however,
for a better understanding of the cellular processes induced by lembehyne
derivatives, further research into the molecular transformations involved
in the lembehyne-induced neuritogenesis is required.

(A) Cell incubation with NGF for 72 h. Cell incubation with compound 12c for (B) 24 h, (C) 48 h, (D) 72 h.

A completely different cell cycle situation is found by flow cytometry
for the treatment of Neuro 2A cells with the lembehyne B derivative
(Figure 4). The histograms
of cell cycle phases in the Neuro 2A cells on exposure to compound 12c show, first, somewhat enhanced capability of cells for
DNA synthesis (increased S phase) and then, by the end of the third
day, a clearly defined decrease in the S and G2 phases, i.e., almost
complete cell disappearance during mitosis.

Figure 4 Cell cycle phases of
the Neuro 2A cells treated with compound 12c (0.2 nM)
and incubated with test compounds for 48 h (A)
and (B) 72 h, respectively.

The obtained data suggest that under the action of lembehyne B,
the mouse neuroblastoma cells are likely to undergo differentiation,
which is confirmed by the activation of neuritogenesis.

3 Conclusions
Thus, as a continuation of our research
on the development of original
methods for the stereoselective synthesis of natural alkynols containing
bis-methylene-separated Z-double bonds, we synthesized a series of
1,3-diyne analogues of natural lembehyne in high yields and with high
selectivity. Biological activity assays in vitro revealed the high
potential of these compounds as bases for the development of modern
antitumor or neuritogenic agents for the treatment of socially significant
human diseases. Currently, we are carrying out intensive research
in this area dealing with the investigation of the molecular mechanisms
of lembehyne-induced neuritogenesis and the antitumor activity of
natural and synthetic lembehynes using advanced molecular biological
approaches of flow cytometry, multiparameter analysis of signaling
pathways, immunohistochemical studies, Western blotting, and fluorescence
spectroscopy.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
All solvents
were dried (1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether over Na) and
freshly distilled before use. All reactions were carried out under
a dry argon atmosphere. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer in CDCl3 operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured on an instrument
using a time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer with electrospray ionization
(ESI). Elemental analyses were performed on an 1106 Carlo Erba apparatus.
The individuality and purity of the synthesized compounds were controlled
using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on Sorbfil plates; anisic aldehyde
in acetic acid was used as a developer. Column chromatography was
carried out on an Acrus silica gel (0.060–0.200 mm). Aliphatic
and oxygenated 1,2-dienes and lembehyne B have been synthesized according
to previously developed procedures.21−24

stirred for 6 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with a 10% solution
of HCl in H2O (20 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether
(2 × 100 mL). The combined organic phases were then dried over
MgSO4, filtered, and the solvents were removed under vacuum.
Silica gel column chromatography (hexane/EtOAc, 35:1) of the residue
gave dienal 4 (1.50 g, 77%) as a pale yellow oily liquid.

for the Preparation of 1,3-Diyne’s
Analogues (12a–d)
To a stirred
solution of n-BuNH2 (0.29 mL) and distilled
H2O (0.58 mL), copper(I) chloride (5.8 mg, 0.06 mmol) was
added at 0 °C under argon, which resulted in a deep blue solution.
A few crystals of NH2OH·HCl were added to discharge
the blue color, and a solution of enynic alcohol (lembehyne B) 10 (150 mg, 0.45 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (1.16
mL) was added via a syringe at the same temperature. Then, 3-bromoprop-2-yn-1-ol
(43 mg, 0.32 mmol) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was warmed
to room temperature and stirred for 30 min. A few crystals of NH2OH·HCl were added occasionally to prevent the solution
from turning green or blue throughout the reaction. Upon completion,
the reaction solution was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
purified by silica gel chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl
acetate, 5:1) as a colorless oil.

4.3 Biological Assays
4.3.1 Cell
Culture
Human cancer cell
lines HeLa and Hek293 were obtained from the HPA Culture Collections
(U.K.). Cells (U937, K562, Jurkat) were purchased from the Russian
Cell Culture Collection (Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy
of Sciences) and cultured according to standard protocols and a sterile
technique. The cell lines were shown to be free from viral contamination
and mycoplasma. HeLa and Hek293 cell lines were cultured as monolayers
and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
a 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were maintained
in RPMI 1640 (Jurkat, K562, U937) (Gibco) supplemented with 4 μM
glutamine, 10% FBS (Sigma), and 100 units/mL penicillin–streptomycin
(Sigma). All types of cells were grown in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were subcultured at 2–3 days
intervals. Adherent cells (HeLa) were suspended using trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and counted after they had reached 80% confluency. Cells
were then seeded in 24-well plates at 5 × 104 cells
per well and incubated overnight. Jurkat, K562, and U937 cells were
subcultured at 2-day intervals with a seeding density of 1 ×
105 cells per 24-well plate in RPMI with 10% FBS. Mouse
neuroblastoma Neuro 2A cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2.

4.3.2 Cytotoxicity Assay
A viability
(Live/Dead) assessment was performed by staining cells with 7-aminoactinomycin
D (7-AAD) (Biolegend). After treatment, cells were harvested, washed
1–2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged
at 400g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended
in 200 μL of flow cytometry staining buffer (PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, 2.5% FBS) and stained with 5 μL
of a 7-AAD staining solution for 15 min at room temperature in the
dark. Samples were acquired on a NovoCyte TM 2000 Flow Cytometry System
(ACEA) equipped with a 488 nm argon laser. Detection of 7-AAD emission
was performed through a 675/30 nm filter in the FL4 channel.

4.3.3 Viability and Apoptosis
Apoptosis
was studied using flow cytometric analysis of annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin
D staining. After treatment, cells were harvested for 24 h, washed
1–2 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged
at 400g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended
in 200 μL of flow cytometry staining buffer (PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, 2.5% FBS). Then, 200 μL of Guava
Nexin reagent (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was added to 5 × 105 cells in 200 μL, and the cells were incubated with
the reagent for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. At the end
of incubation, the cells were analyzed on a NovoCyte TM 2000 Flow
Cytometry System (ACEA).

4.3.4 Cell Cycle Analysis
The cell cycle
was analyzed using the method of propidium iodide staining. After
treatment, cells were harvested for 24 h, washed 1–2 times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and centrifuged at 400g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μL
of flow cytometry staining buffer (PBS without Ca2+ and
Mg2+, 2.5% FBS). Then, cells were plated in 24-well round-bottom
plates at a density of 10 × 105 cells per well, centrifuged
at 450g for 5 min, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol
for 24 h at 0 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature with 250 μL of Guava Cell Cycle
Reagent (Millipore) in the dark. Samples were analyzed on a NovoCyte
TM 2000 Flow Cytometry System (ACEA).

4.3.5 Cell
Differentiation Assay
The
Neuro 2A cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 1 ×
104 cells/cm2 with 1 mL of the culture medium.
After a 24 h cultivation, the medium was exchanged for a fresh medium,
and a testing sample of 10 mL of an ethanol solution was added to
each well. After 12, 24, 48, and 72 h incubations, morphological changes
in the cells were observed under a phase-contrast microscope. The
cells that had processes longer than the diameter of the cell body
were evaluated as neurite-bearing cells. The percentage of the cells
with neurites in a particular culture was determined by counting at
least 300 cells in the photomicrographs of the areas where the cell
density was representative.
