A large
enhancement of the Ni and Cr ferromagnetic moments under UV-light irradiation
has been detected in 55 nm thick K0.98Ni[Cr(CN)6]0.70[(H2O)6]0.30·0.11H2O Prussian blue analogues coated on 240 nm Rb0.76Co[Fe(CN)6]0.74[(H2O)6]0.26·0.56H2O nanocubes. Two separate
magnetic transitions were found. The one at 72 K marks the magnetic
ordering of the Ni and Cr ions on the shell. A higher degree of electronic
connection along the Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni
chains was achieved by the incorporation of a larger amount of K+ ions into the voids enclosed by the NiN6 and CrC6 octahedra, which was used to understand the appearance of
photoenhanced ferromagnetism in the K–Ni–Cr network.
A weak moment developed in the core below 10 K, corresponding to separate
ordering of the Co and Fe ions in the Rb–Co–Fe network.
Photoinduced ferromagnetism of the Co and Fe ions in the Rb–Co–Fe
was also detected.

1 Introduction
Prussian blue analogues
(PBAs) demonstrate many fascinating magnetic
behaviors. In this study, we examine PBAs, with the general chemical
formula of AxM[M′(CN)6]y·nH2O (A–M–M′), where M and M′ indicate divalent
and trivalent transition-metal ions, respectively, and A indicates
monovalent alkali ions that are accommodated in the voids enclosed
by the MN6 and M′C6 octahedra. Their
magnetic characteristics are dependent on the intrinsic nature of
the complexes but can also be greatly altered by extrinsic stimulation,
such as the application of pressure or light irradiation.1−12 In particular, one very promising characteristic is the photoinduced
magnetism found in A–Co–Fe (with A = K, Na, Rb, and
Cs), which has been demonstrated to be sensitive to the type and the
amount of A+ ions that have been incorporated into the
compound.1,2,6 This behavior
is believed to originate from the electron transfer that occurs between
the MN6 and M′C6 octahedra, known as
the charge-transfer-induced spin transition (CTIST).13−15 It has been shown that a significant reduction in magnetization
occurs as a consequence of light irradiation in layered Rb–Ni–Cr/Rb–Co–Fe/Rb–Ni–Cr
heterostructures composed of a photosensitive Rb–Co–Fe
film sandwiched between two pressure-sensitive Rb–Ni–Cr
films.16,17 This reduction is believed to be a direct
result of the weakening of the atomic connections between the CoN6 and FeC6 octahedra, caused by the lattice expansion
of the Rb–Co–Fe layer driven by the strain that builds
up at the interfaces as a consequence of light irradiation. In addition,
the photomagnetic response of nanosized core/shell heterostructures
has recently been found to be sensitive to the shell thickness.18−22 No photoinduced magnetism has been identified in isolated K–Ni–Cr,
but light irradiation leads to a noticeable reduction (∼8%)
of the magnetization when this material is coated on a Rb–Co–Fe
nanocube.18 This reduction is understood
to be linked to the structural distortion that occurs in the K–Ni–Cr,
triggered by the stress that develops in the photoactive Rb–Co–Fe.
Clearly, the photomagnetic sensitivity of PBA can be tuned by adjusting
the chemical composition and stress of these complexes. In this study,
we aim to develop K–Ni–Cr PBAs, where light irradiation
will enhance, rather than reduce, the magnetic strength of the compound.
We demonstrate that K–Ni–Cr can become photoactive in
high-K+-containing compounds. We detected significant increases
of the Ni and Cr magnetic moments upon UV-light irradiation in a 55
nm thick high-K+-containing K–Ni–Cr shell
coated on a 240 nm Rb–Co–Fe cube (hereafter Rb–Co–Fe@K–Ni–Cr).
Surprisingly, the photoenhancement of the magnetic moments for the
K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 phase was as large
as that for the Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74 phase. The better photomagnetic sensitivity in the present K–Ni–Cr
PBA network was obtained by the incorporation of a large amount of
K+ ions into the compound, leading to a greater electron
distribution near the bridging C–N ions, which strengthened
the electronic connections in the Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni
chains.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Sample
Fabrication
The core@shell
PBA heterostructures, with the Rb–Co–Fe phase at the
core and the K–Ni–Cr phase on the shell, were synthesized
by the coprecipitation method. The core particles Rb–Co–Fe
were prepared by adding 330 mL of an aqueous solution containing 2.58
mmol CoCl2·6H2O and 2.82 mmol RbCl to 300
mL of pure water together with 340 mL of an aqueous solution containing
1.1 mmol K3Fe(CN)6. The mixture was then slowly
stirred for 18 h. The microcrystalline powder was isolated from the
solution by centrifugation and then rinsed three times with pure water. For the synthesis of Rb–Co–Fe@K–Ni–Cr
particles, previously prepared core particles were dispersed in 200
mL of pure water, followed by the addition of 150 mL of aqueous NiCl2·6H2O (2.14 mmol) and 150 mL of aqueous K3Cr(CN)6 (1.04 mmol) at a rate of 20 mL/h into the
Rb–Co–Fe dispersion using a peristaltic pump. The solution
was slowly stirred for 18 h after the addition was completed. The
particles were subsequently filtered in vacuum before being washed
and redispersed in 100 mL of pure water. This process was repeated
for five cycles.

2.2 Instrumentation
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer,
employing the standard setup for reflection geometry. Neutron diffraction
measurements were conducted at the Bragg Institute, Australian Nuclear
Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Australia, using the
high-intensity powder diffractometer Wombat, employing an incident
wavelength of λ = 2.41 Å defined by Ge(113) crystals. For
these measurements, ∼1 g of the sample was loosely loaded into
a cylindrical aluminum holder (9 mm in diameter and 30 mm in length)
with a shiny inner surface. The device was equipped with a quartz
tube (5 mm in diameter) located along the central axis of the holder
to facilitate light irradiation. The PBA powder was loosely packed
(2 mm thick) in the quartz tube, allowing 35% light transmission,
which, combined with the shiny inner face of the Al holder that acted
as a light reflector, allowed the light to bounce back and forth inside
the holder for uniform illumination of the PBA sample. The sample
temperature was controlled using a He gas refrigerator system. The
magnetization and alternating current (ac) magnetic susceptibility
measurements were performed on a physical property measurement system
(PPMS), manufactured by Quantum Design, Inc., employing the standard
setups. For these measurements, ∼80 mg of the sample was loosely
packed into a thin nonmagnetic cylindrical holder that produced a
smooth temperature curve with a background signal that was ∼2%
the strength of the signal from the sample. The powdered sample was
shaken at 50 Hz for 5 min using a Vortex-Genie mixer to avoid aggregation
among the nanoparticles. The mass density was 1.6% of the bulk density,
which corresponds to an average interparticle separation from edge
to edge of 2.6 times the particle diameter so that the interparticle
interaction would be insignificant.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Chemical Composition
The crystalline
structure and stoichiometric parameters were determined by combining
and cross-checking of profile refinements of the X-ray and neutron
diffraction patterns. XRD measurements were first used to construct
the backbone of the crystalline structure. Neutron diffraction was
then used to identify the atomic positions and the stoichiometric
amounts of the transition-metal ions and H2O molecules
within the compound. It is known that the M ions in PBAs with a general
chemical formula of AxM[M′(CN)6]y·nH2O will form a face-centered cubic sublattice allowing the
accommodation of either M′(CN)6 or (H2O)6 between the two M ions along the three crystallographic
axis directions, giving rise to a stoichiometric composition of [M′(CN)6]y[(H2O)6]1–y. In addition, the voids enclosed
by the MN6 and M′C6 octahedra can accommodate
either alkali A ions or H2O molecules or be left empty,
giving rise to a stoichiometric composition of Ax(H2O)z, with x + z ≤ 1, for the atoms in the
voids. A constrained stoichiometric composition of Ax(H2O)zM[M′(CN)6]y[(H2O)6]1–y, with x + z ≤ 1, for each of the PBA phases was used for pattern
refinement. Crystalline analysis was then carried out for the determination
of the stoichiometric compositions (x, y, z) for each phase and the atomic positions of
C, N, and the two separate O ions (one in the 8c sites and the other
bound to the M′ ions) in the unit cell. Our structural analysis
began with profile refinement of the XRD pattern, with a focus on
obtaining the stoichiometric composition x, with
the occupancies of C and N being constrained as the same as the associated
Fe or Ni, but ignoring the existence of H. The fit can be greatly
improved by refining the neutron diffraction patterns, beginning with
the structural parameters obtained from the X-ray results, but focusing
on refining y, z, and the positions
of H. The structural parameters thus obtained were once again fed
back into the X-ray patterns for further refinement of x and again to the neutron patterns for further refinement of the y, z, and H2O parameters. The
structural parameters were found to converge after three cycles of
refinement analysis, combining the X-ray and neutron results.

The diffraction patterns were analyzed using the Rietveld method,23 employing the general structure analysis system
(GSAS) program.24 Two separate structural
phases with the same cubic Fm3̅m symmetry can be identified in each diffraction pattern, one belonging
to the Rb–Co–Fe phase and the other to the K–Ni–Cr
phase. The observed and calculated X-ray and neutron diffraction patterns
at 80 K are shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively. The chemical compositions obtained for
the two phases after final refinement were Rb0.76Co[Fe(CN)6]0.74[(H2O)6]0.26·0.56H2O with a cubic lattice constant of a = 9.943(2) Å and K0.98Ni[Cr(CN)6]0.70[(H2O)6]0.30·0.11H2O with a = 10.337(4) Å at 80 K. The
mass ratio of the Rb–Co–Fe to K–Ni–Cr
phases obtained from the fit was 57:43. The refined structural parameters
of the two phases at 300, 80, and 3 K are summarized in Tables 1, 2,
and 3, respectively. We note that refinement imposes constraints on the charge balance,
thus assuming ionic states of A1+, M3+, and
M′2+, and results in unacceptable negative occupancies
for the A sites in both phases or almost fully occupied M′
sties for both phases but with a very poor fit (χ2 = 2.85, Rp = 2.38%, and Rwp = 3.49% with constraints; χ2 = 1.26, Rp = 1.79%, and Rwp = 2.32% without constraints). Rb0.76Co[Fe(CN)6]0.74[(H2O)6]0.26·0.56H2O and K0.98Ni[Cr(CN)6]0.70[(H2O)6]0.30·0.11H2O obtained for the present compound indicate that portions of the
Co and Ni ions are in the M3+ ionic state at 80 K. The
bond valence calculations25,26 give bond valence sums
of 2.93 and 2.97 for the Co and Ni ions, respectively, at 80 K. In
addition, the X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) reveals a binding
energy of 578.5 eV for the Cr 2p3/2 line (Figure 2), which differs from the 576.5
eV for the Cr3+ 2p3/2 line in the starting material
K3Cr(CN)6 and the 576.7 eV for the Cr3+ 2p3/2 line in Mn1.5[Cr(CN)6]·mH2O@Ni1.5[Cr(CN)6]·nH2O PBA,27 but is
close to the 578.1 eV of the Cr2+ 2p3/2 line
in CrF2. Apparently, a reduction of the Cr valence from
the Cr3+ in K3Cr(CN)6 does occur
during fabrication process. On the other hand, the binding energy
of the Fe 2p3/2 line is not clearly revealed in the XPS
results, reflecting the attenuation of the XPS signal from the Rb–Co–Fe
phase in the core.

The crystalline structure of the PBA can be viewed
as being composed
of MN6 and M′C6 octahedra that are alternately
linked to form M–N–C–M′–C–N–M
chains along all three crystallographic axis directions. This structure
opens up channels among the chains, with A+ ions or H2O accommodated in the voids, as shown in Figure 3. A relatively large amount
of K (∼50%) occupies the voids in the K–Ni–Cr
phase on the shell, but less amount of Rb (∼38%) for the Rb–Co–Fe
phase in the core. There were no identifiable traces of impurity phases
in the neutron or XRD patterns. No structural symmetry change was
detected between 450 and 3 K, as the same cubic Fm3̅m crystalline symmetry was maintained in
both the Rb–Co–Fe and K–Ni–Cr phases in
this temperature range.

structure of the
Rb–Co–Fe in the core and the K–Ni–Cr shell.
This structure can be viewed as consisting of Co–N–C–Fe–C–N–Co
chains in the core and Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni
chains in the shell along the three crystallographic axis directions.
The atomic deficiencies revealed in the plot are for the K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 phase.

3.2 Structural Conformation
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images (insets to Figure 4a) revealed the presence of core@shell nanocubes,
rather than spherical nanoparticles, in the compound. The size distribution,
calculated from the TEM images, reveals the nanocubes to have a mean
diameter of d = 350 nm (Figure 4a), with 90% of the cubes in the assembly
having an edge length in the range of 350 ± 50 nm. Composition
scans, employing a beam spot 22 nm in size, of the nanocubes revealed
no Co but Ni at the edges, which penetrated 44 nm into the nanocubes
(Figure 4b). In other
words, there is a 44 nm wide region, where the Ni composition decreases
and the Co composition increases toward the interior of the nanocubes.
It is important to note that this does not indicate the appearance
of an interfacial layer where the two phases mix together, but a direct
result of scanning the beam spot through the interface. The thickness
of the shell is calculated to be 44 + (22/2) = 55 nm. The compositions
of both Ni and Co stabilize about 66 nm deep into the nanocubes. It
is clear that the core@shell nanocubes are composed of Rb–Co–Fe
cubic cores with a mean edge length of 240 nm covered by K–Ni–Cr
shells with a mean thickness of 55 nm. This result agrees reasonably
well with the mass ratio of 55% for the Rb–Co–Fe phase
and 45% for the K–Ni–Cr phase obtained from the neutron
diffraction measurements.

3.3 Negative
Thermal Expansion (NTE)
A dramatic change to significantly
smaller unit cells of the Rb–Co–Fe
phases appeared upon cooling to 280 K (Figure 5a). This large shrinkage of the Rb–Co–Fe
unit cells upon cooling goes beyond what can be accounted for by strengthening
of the lattice anharmonicity. Rather it has been suggested28 that it is associated with the occurrence of
CTIST.13,14 No such CTIST-related unit-cell shrinking
was detected for the K–Ni–Cr phase upon cooling to 3
K, but revealing noticeable increases in the widths of the diffraction
peaks along with the thermal shifts of the peak positions upon warming
to above 150 K for the N–Ni–Cr phase (Figure 5a). Interestingly, the increase
in the {400} intensity of the Rb–Co–Fe phase upon cooling
through the transition was accompanied by a decrease in the {400}
intensity of the K–Ni–Cr phase (Figure 5a). Similar changes of the diffraction intensities
were also observable28 by XRD. There were
no obvious anomalies found in the thermal variations of the magnetization
or magnetic susceptibility through the transition, measured employing
the PPMS magnetometer. The thermally induced changes in the diffraction
intensities through the transition were mainly structural, rather
than magnetic, in origin. In addition, NTE, where lattice shrinks
upon warming, of the K–Ni–Cr phase appears above 320
K (Figure 5b). No NTE
was found for the Rb–Co–Fe phase. These XRD patterns
were taken from 300 K, employing a low warming rate (∼1 K/min)
when temperature changes were initiated. The NTE observed for the
K–Ni–Cr phase is intrinsic because it begins to appear
at a relatively low temperature of 320 K, where loss of H2O from the compound is unlikely to occur.

diffraction peaks obtained by (a) neutron
diffraction from 10 to 300 K and (b) XRD from 300 to 450 K. Dramatic
changes of the Rb–Co–Fe unit cell appear around 280
K, and NTEs of the K–Ni–Cr unit cell appear above 320
K.

3.4 Magnetic
Transitions
Two magnetic
transitions, labeled Tm1 and Tm2, are clearly revealed in the isofield direct current
magnetization M(T) and ac magnetic
susceptibility χ′(T) curves (Figure 6a). There is a large
increase in the magnetization upon cooling to below Tm1 = 72 K, which is linked to the magnetic ordering of
the Ni and Cr ions in the K–Ni–Cr phase on the shell.
At 30 K, the Ni spins together with the Cr spins developed a ferromagnetic
arrangement with magnetic moments of ⟨μZ⟩Ni = 0.93(9)μB and ⟨μZ⟩Cr = 1.50(9)μB pointing along
the [111] crystallographic direction at 30 K (Figure 6b). This magnetic diffraction pattern is
indicative of the additional intensity that developed upon cooling
from 80 to 30 K. It is analyzed employing the GSAS program, assuming
the same spatial symmetry of the crystalline structure for the magnetic
structure. It is interesting to note that the magnetic response (χ′)
associated with the transition at Tm1 was
largely suppressed by the applied magnetic field. An Ha as weak as 200 Oe leads to a decrease in χ′
response by as much as 1 order of magnitude. This reflects the known
glassy nature of the nonstoichiometric PBAs, rather than the antiferromagnetic
character of the transition at Tm1. The M(T) and χ′(T) curves reveal slightly but noticeably larger values of M and χ′ below Tm2 = 10 K (Figure 6a),
which are linked to the magnetic ordering of the Co and Fe ions in
the Rb–Co–Fe phase in the core. Interestingly, M and χ′ decreased with decreasing temperature
below 7 K. These measurements were performed in warming processes,
after zero-field cooling from 300 to 1.8 K and a wait time of 30 min.
It revealed the thermal agitation of the magnetic-order parameter.
The thermal behavior of M below 10 K is currently
not completely understood. It is known that increases of M and χ′ can occur upon warming from a low temperature
in situations where a residual field appears in the zero-field process,
if the residual field is sufficient to cause alignment of the Ni–Cr
domains but too small to align all of the Co–Fe domains. However,
a residual field of 15 Oe, judging from the M(Ha) curve taken at 2 K, would be required to
account for the 0.7 emu upturn revealed in the M(T) curve at temperatures below 7 K. It is unlikely that
such a high residual field did appear. One possible source would be
that the magnetic moments in the Rb–Co–Fe core and on
the K–Ni–Cr shell point in opposite directions, causing
the appearance of a spiral moment arrangement in the interfacial layer.
The increase in M on warming from a low temperature
is a result of the weakening of the moments in the Rb–Co–Fe
core, whereas the decrease in M above 7 K reflects
the weakening of the moments in the interfacial layer. These small
changes in M are beyond the current capability of
the neutron diffraction to monitor.

where the neutron diffraction intensities observed at 80 K, which
serve as the nonmagnetic background, have been subtracted. The solid
curves indicate the calculated magnetic intensities based on the proposed
spin arrangement.

3.5 Photomagnetic
Sensitivity
It is remarkable
to see that the magnetic moments of both the K–Ni–Cr
and Rb–Co–Fe phases increase significantly upon continuous
irradiation with 365 nm UV light at 2.5 mW during the measurement,
as revealed by the large increases of the neutron magnetic intensities
associated with both phases (Figure 7). Photoinduced magnetism has been observed in Rb–Co–Fe16 but has not yet been detected in K–Ni–Cr
complexes. Surprisingly, the magnetic phase of K–Ni–Cr
is more sensitive to light irradiation than that of Rb–Co–Fe,
as reflected by the increase in the representative (200) magnetic
intensity of the K–Ni–Cr phase, which is 1.7 times larger
than that of the Rb–Co–Fe phase. We note that the mass
of the K–Ni–Cr phase in the compound is only 80% that
of the Rb–Co–Fe phase. It is known that the magnetic
intensity is primarily linked to the magnetic form factor and magnetic
moment.29 The magnetic form factors of
the Ni2+, Cr3+, Co2+, and Fe3+ spins in the (200) scattering regime are comparable (0.90–0.92),30 and the moment direction does not greatly affect
the magnetic intensity in high-symmetry cubic crystals. It is the
magnitude of the magnetic moment that develops upon light irradiation,
which gives rise to the increase in the magnetic intensities. It appears
that the magnetic diffraction pattern enhanced by the UV-light irradiation
(Figure 7) is different
from that obtained by cooling (Figure 6b). In particular, the UV-light irradiation produces
a much more intense (111) magnetic reflection, showing that the irradiation
generates different amounts of magnetic moments for the Ni and Cr
ions. This is understandable because the Ni and Cr ions are in different
magnetic states. There is no structural symmetry change or lattice
distortion induced by the UV-light irradiation that may be identified
from the neutron diffraction patterns. However, neutron diffraction
patterns do reveal noticeable changes in the atomic positions, especially
for C and N, after irradiation (Tables 3 and 4). The Cr–C and
Fe–C separations reduce by ∼2.8 and ∼2.2%, respectively,
whereas the Ni–N and Co–N separations increase by ∼2.5
and ∼1.9%, respectively, after UV-light irradiation. In addition,
expected20 changes in the lattice constants
upon light irradiation will not be revealed in the present neutron
diffraction patterns, which are focused on intensity but relaxed in
resolution. The magnetic moments of the Ni and Cr ions increase by
0.23 and 0.32μB, respectively, upon irradiation with
365 nm UV light at 2.5 mW, assuming that the moment directions and
crystalline structure remain unaltered. Correspondingly, magnetic
moments of 0.26(1)μB for the Co ions and 0.19(2)μB for the Fe ions are found to develop. Photoirradiation
drives the Cr ions from in the S = 1 to 3/2 magnetic
state and the Ni ions from in the S = 1/2 to 1 magnetic
state. The increases in the magnetic moments of 0.32 and 0.23μB for Cr and Ni ions, respectively, correspond to 32% of the
Cr ions being photoactive, with only 0.23/0.32 = 72% of the electron
transfer reaching the Ni ions. On the other hand, photoirradiation
drives the nonmagnetic Fe and Co ions into the S =
1/2 and 3/2 magnetic states, respectively. The increases in the magnetic
moments of 0.19 and 0.26μB for Fe and Co ions, respectively,
correspond to 19% of the Fe ions being photoactive but only (0.26/3)/0.19
= 46% of the electron transfers reaching Co ions.

taken with and without light irradiation at 3 K. The magnetic intensities
associated with the K–Ni–Cr and Rb–Co–Fe
phases are revealed. The solid curves indicate the calculated magnetic
intensities based on the proposed spin arrangement. The solid vertical
lines mark the calculated positions of the magnetic Bragg reflections
of the proposed spin arrangements for the K–Ni–Cr (top
series) and Rb–Co–Fe (bottom series).

It is interesting that photomagnetic activity was
not found in
other Rb–Co–Fe@K–Ni–Cr PBAs of similar
structure, as reported in ref (31). The main difference between the two compounds is that
the K+ composition of the compound discussed in the present
work is significantly higher (2.7 times) than that of the one reported
in ref (31) as confirmed
by the smaller relative intensity between the (200) and (220) X-ray
reflections obtained for the present compound (Figure 8). We note that a higher-K+-containing
compound will generate less intense (200) X-ray reflections together with more intense (220) X-ray
reflections. The intensity ratios between the (200) and (220) X-ray
reflections observed in the present compound and in the one reported
in ref (31) are 1.53
and 1.71, respectively (Figure 8). The chemical composition of the compound discussed in the
present work is Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74@K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70, whereas the
one reported in ref (31) has a chemical composition of Rb0.48–Co–Fe0.74@K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74. The
appearance of more K+ ions in the voids enclosed by the
NiN6 and CrC6 octahedra will supply more electronic
charges to their neighboring atoms so that a higher electronic charge
distribution around the Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni
chains can be anticipated. In one study, a 0.5% increase in the magnetization
contributed from the shell after light irradiation in Rb0.5–Co–Fe0.8@Rb0.2–Ni–Cr0.7 PBA was reported.20 However,
the A sites are much less occupied and the thickness of the shell
was much less for the compound reported in ref (20) compared to the compound
discussed in the present study. Photomagnetic activity can be sensitive
to the size of the compound.20 Apparently,
the relatively high photomagnetic sensitivity for the K–Ni–Cr
phase in the present compound not only links to the high K composition
but size may also play a crucial role. In addition, large increases
in the magnetization and coercive field, as a consequence of light
irradiation, have also been reported19 in
Cs0.5–Ni–Fe0.95@Cs0.5–Co–Fe0.8, where the insertion of Cs+ ions has been demonstrated to be essential for efficient
photomagnetic activity.

Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74@K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 and (b) the Rb0.48–Co–Fe0.74@K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74 reported
in ref (30) taken at
80 K, revealing the intensity ratios for the (200)/(220) reflections
of 1.53 and 1.71 for the K–Ni–Cr in (a) and (b), respectively.

3.6 Electronic
Charge Distribution
Remarkably,
the electronic charge distribution of the K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 discussed in the present work is quite different from
that of the K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74 reported
in ref (31). The distribution
of the electronic charge density in the Ni–N–C–Cr
chains in the present K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 is noticeably widely extended, and a greater electronic charge appeared
between the two Cr–Cr nearest neighbors along the [110] crystallographic
direction (Figure 9a,b). These electron-density maps were obtained by employing the
GSAS program, starting with profile refinement of the XRD patterns,
followed by calculation of the inverse Fourier transforms of the structure
factors to extract the electron-density distribution. The electron-density
contour map of a specific plane was then obtained by slicing the electron
density in the vicinity of the specific plane, including 0.025 Å
below and above it.

Figure 9 Electronic charge densities in the (0 0 0.05) crystallographic
plane of (a) the present Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74@K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 and
(b) the Rb0.48–Co–Fe0.74@K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74 reported in ref (31), as inferred from the
XRD data. The color bars are in units of e/Å3.

It is clear that the amount of
K+ ions incorporated
into the compound can significantly alter the electronic charge distribution.
These changes are better revealed in the difference density plots,
where the electron density of the K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74 reported in ref (31) is subtracted from that of the present K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70. Such difference density plots
for the three representative (0 0 0), (0 0 0.05), and (0 0 0.08) lattice
planes are illustrated in Figure 9. The atomic positions with negative difference density
values represent the locations in the unit cell where the electronic
charge is less in the present compound but distributed to the positions
with positive values. The contribution from the K+ ions
at (0.25 0.25 0.25) gives rise to more of the electronic charges being
distributed between the two Cr–Cr ions along the [110] crystallographic
direction, which is still significant even on the (000) lattice plane
(Figure 10a). Stronger
magnetic coupling between the two nearest Cr–Cr ions can then
be anticipated. An increase of the electronic charge density between
the two nearest Ni–Ni ions along the [1̅10] crystallographic
direction is also evident. Interestingly, the outer electronic charges
of the C ions at (0.199 0 0) increase largely but distributed toward
the N ions at (0.323 0 0) (Figure 10a,b). In addition, the outer electronic charges of the Cr ions (Figure 10b,c), Ni ions (Figure 10a,c), and N ions
(Figure 10b,c) are
more extended/distributed. A better electronic connection along the
Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni chains
can thus be anticipated in the high-K+-containing compounds
(Figure 10c).

Figure 10 Differences
in the electronic charge
density between the present Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74@K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 and
the Rb0.48–Co–Fe0.74@K0.36–Ni–Cr0.74 reported in ref (31) in the (a) (0 0 0), (b)
(0 0 0.05), and (c) (0 0 0.08) crystallographic planes. The atomic
positions with negative difference density values represent the locations
where electronic charges are less in the present compound but redistributed
to the positions with positive values. The color bars are in units
of e/Å3.

3.7 Possible Mechanisms
The photoinduced
magnetism observed in the A–Co-Fe PBAs is understood to originate
from the charge transfer occurring between the Fe and Co ions, triggered
by light irradiation, transferring the nonmagnetic Co3+–N–C–Fe2+ configuration into the
magnetic Co2+–N–C–Fe3+ one.13,14 The main mechanism behind the photoenhanced ferromagnetism in the
K–Ni–Cr network is not completely understood at this
time. The weakening of the magnetic coupling induced by the stress
that builds up at the interface in the Rb–Co–Fe@K–Ni–Cr
compound, which has been reported in ref (17), does not appear in the present study. There
was no significant change in the lattice constant following UV-light
irradiation found in either the Rb–Co–Fe or K–Ni–Cr
phase, where the lattice constant of Rb–Co–Fe changed
from 9.942(2) to 9.939(2) Å and that of K–Ni–Cr
changed from 10.332(4) to 10.334(4) Å. Light irradiation does
result in significant shrinkages of the C–Cr and C–Fe
separations together with large enlargements of the Ni–N and
Co–N separations. It appears that the N–C blocks shift
toward Cr or Fe ion. The origin for the absence of a change in lattice
constant upon light irradiation can be linked to that the wavelength
of the light is not appropriate and/or that only there are small amounts
of Co and Fe ions that are photoactive (32% for Co and 19% for Fe).
Structural analysis assuming Fe-C–N–Co chains in the
Rb–Fe–Co phase and Ni–C–N–Cr chains
in the K–Ni–Cr phase results in a very poor fit (χ2 = 7.233, Rp = 2.15%, and Rwp = 2.82%) with unacceptable negative occupancies
for the A sites in both phases. In particular, it generates an intensity
for the (111) reflection that is 230% of the observed one. Refinements
allowing both coordination isomers to appear in both phases give small
fractions for the Fe–C–N–Co (4.5%) and Ni–C–N–Cr
(5.3%) chains. Cyanide coordination isomerism is unlikely the dominant
factor for the observed photoenhanced ferromagnetism in the K–Ni–Cr
network. One possible source for the photoenhanced ferromagnetism
in the K–Ni–Cr is the direct excitation from the t2g to eg orbitals of the Cr ions in the CrO6 octahedra and the Ni ions in the NiN6 octahedra
by the UV-light irradiation. This, however, would lead to the transfer
of Cr ions from the S = 1 to 2 magnetic state and
the Ni ions from the S = 1/2 to 3/2 magnetic state,
which would give rise to much larger increases in the Cr and Ni magnetic
moments than the 34 and 15% increases, respectively, observed in the
present study, if all of the Ni and Cr ions are excited. In addition,
bond valence calculations,25,26 based on the structural
parameters obtained from the neutron diffraction patterns, show that
the bond valence of the Ni ions in K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 changes from +2.79 to +2.23 upon irradiation by UV light,
whereas that of the Co ions in Rb0.76–Co–Fe0.74 changes from +2.73 to +2.33. It has been pointed out that
the insertion of low alkali cations in A–M–M′
PBs will give rise to a high-spin state for the M ions with weak ligand
fields around them.3 Increasing the alkali
cation content can significantly strengthen the ligand fields around
the M ions so that more M ions will undergo a change in spin accompanied
by electron transfer to [M′(CN)6] upon cooling or
photoirradiation.3 The relatively high
K composition in the present K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 provides more electronic connections along the Ni–N–C–Cr
chains, leading to greater photoinduced charge transfer along the
chains upon cooling or photoirradiation. Relatively small magnetic
moments were developed for the Ni (0.93μB) and Cr
(1.50μB) ions upon cooling, reflecting a relatively
weak superexchange coupling between the Ni and Cr ions. The enhanced
ferromagnetism for the K–Ni–Cr network by UV-light irradiation
can be a result of enhanced superexchange coupling between the Ni
and Cr ions mediated through the bridging N–C ions.

4 Conclusions
A nanosized Prussian blue core@shell heterostructure
with a 240
nm Rb0.76Co[Fe(CN)6]0.74[(H2O)6]0.26·0.56H2O cubic core
covered by a 55 nm K0.98Ni[Cr(CN)6]0.70[(H2O)6]0.30·0.11H2O shell was synthesized by the coprecipitation method. A relatively
high K composition was incorporated into the compound by employing
a denser K3Cr(CN)6 aqueous solution during the
preparation process. Two magnetic transitions at 10 and 72 K were
identified. The transition at 10 K is linked to the ferromagnetic
ordering of the Co and Fe ions in the Rb–Co–Fe phase.
The magnetic moments of Co and Fe were greatly enhanced by UV-light
irradiation as detected through neutron diffraction. The thermal CTIST
could barely be seen in the Rb–Co–Fe phase, but charge
transfer could be triggered by optical excitation to reveal the magnetic
state. The transition at 72 K is linked to the ferromagnetic ordering
of the Ni and Cr spins in the K–Ni–Cr phase. Significant
increases of the Ni and Cr magnetic moments (34 and 15%, respectively)
were found after photoirradiation by 365 nm UV light at 2.5 mW. The
photoenhanced ferromagnetic strength is understood to be linked to
the direct excitation from the t2g to eg orbitals
of the Cr and Ni ions and/or the enhanced superexchange coupling between
the Ni and Cr ions, made possible by the incorporation of more K+ ions into the compound, allowing for a higher degree of electronic
connectivity along the Ni–N–C–Cr–C–N–Ni
chains. It is the high K+ in the compound together with
UV radiation excitation that triggers the enhanced ferromagnetism
in K0.98–Ni–Cr0.70 PBAs.
