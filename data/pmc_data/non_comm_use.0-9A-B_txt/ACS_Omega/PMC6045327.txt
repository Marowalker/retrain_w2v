Plasmonic-mediated
photothermal heating under near-infrared (NIR)
irradiation is an emerging key technology in the field of photothermal
therapy and chemical reactions. However, there are few reports of
photothermal film (dry-type patch), and thus, in this work, we developed
the plasmonic-induced photothermal cellulose-patch operating in the
NIR region. Hollow and spikelike gold nanostructures, gold-spikes,
as plasmonic nanoparticles were prepared and decorated on silica microrods,
which were prepared based on a unicellular organism, Escherichia coli, as a framework. In addition, freestanding
cellulose-patch was prepared by mixing filter-paper pulp and armored
golden E. coli (AGE) microrods. The
major absorbing peak of AGE solution was revealed to be 873 nm, and
the surface temperature of patch was increased to 264 °C within
a very short time (1 min). When NIR laser was irradiated on the patch
dipped in the water, the formation of water vapor and air bubbles
was observed. The heating efficiency of indirect heat transfer via
conduction from patch-to-water was 35.0%, while that of direct heat
transfer via radiation from patch in water was 86.1%. Therefore, the
cellulose-patch containing AGE microrods has possible applicability
to desalination and sterilization because of its fast heating rate
and high light-to-heat conversion under the irradiation of low-powered
IR laser.

1 Introduction
The
elevation of reaction temperature in a reactor is enhanced
by the overall reaction rate,1 and a higher
temperature in thermotherapy of cancer cells shows the effective inhibition
of cancer cell growth.2 Because the conventional
approach in the chemical reaction and thermotherapy could not localize
heat in the target region, the heat dissipation into the surrounding
system in the chemical reaction and in thermotherapy induced low energy
efficiency and damage to surrounding tissues and cellular components,
respectively. In contrast, localized heating at the nanoscale region
in solution or inner cell achieved using localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) of metallic nanoparticles (NPs), such as Au, Ag,
and Cu,3−5 could enhance the energy efficiency in the chemical
reaction and minimize the unintended damage to nearby cells. Therefore,
LSPR-mediated photothermal heating under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation
is used as an emerging key technology in the field of photothermal
therapy (PTT),6−8 and chemical reactions.1,4

It is
well-known that the fundamental requirements of ideal photothermal
heating agents are that they should exhibit strong absorbance in the
NIR region and efficiently transfer the absorbed NIR optical energy
to heat. Among the photothermal agents, NIR organic dyes also show
strong potential in noninvasive tumor therapy, and indocyanine green
as an NIR-heptamethine cyanine dye has been used in clinical diagnosis.9,10 This dye preferentially accumulates in tumor cells, yielding a good
signal-to-background ratio.9 As reported
by Jain et al., AuNPs of 40 nm size show an absorption cross section
that is 5 orders higher than conventional absorbing dyes,11 making plasmonic NPs ideal photothermal agents,
with much higher efficiency than the more commonly used organic dyes.
Therefore, metallic NPs offer enhanced absorption and scattering in
the NIR region, facile synthesis, and good biocompatibility, as compared
to organic dyes. In addition, the thermoplasmonic feature of metallic
NPs could be easily and readily controlled by adjusting their size
and shape.12

To expand the absorption
band to the NIR region and enhance the
light-to-heat conversion, new nanomaterials were recently suggested
by altering their shape: Au nanospheres to Au nanospikes or Au nanorods.
Au nanospikes showed an obvious strong absorption band in the NIR
region in the range (700–1000) nm, with a strong peak at 800
nm,5 providing a local electromagnetic
(EM) field.7 Au nanorods possess large
extinction cross sections and have synthetically tunable longitudinal
plasmon wavelengths that cover the entire solar spectrum.1,8

Other than PTT or photothermal reactions, the photothermal
feature
of metallic NPs is being applied to a wide range of applications,
such as solar steam generation,13,14 desalination,15 and sterilization.16,17 Zhou et al. found that the thermoplasmonic absorber-based solar
steam generation showed over 90% efficiency under solar irradiation
of 4 kW/m2.13 Politano et al.
showed photothermal membrane decorated with AgNPs for seawater desalination
successfully working under UV irradiation.15 Chen et al. demonstrated that the CuNP-decorated hydrogel under
660 nm laser irradiation has antibacterial properties, owing to the
heating effects.16 However, the high-efficiency
conversion of light-to-heat in this application area required high-powered
UV or visible-light laser for irradiation. With high-power lasers,
LSPR-induced local photothermal heating can even melt and reshape
the AuNPs.3 Therefore, photothermal application
of metallic NPs is required to have fast heating rate, repeatability,
thermal stability, and high conversion of light-to-heat under low-powered
laser (<4 W/cm2) in the NIR region.

In this work,
we developed the plasmonic-induced photothermal cellulose-patch
operating in the NIR region. Herein, gold-spikes (AuNS) with hollow
and spikelike nanostructures as plasmonic NPs were prepared and decorated
on silica microrods, which were prepared based on a unicellular organism, Escherichia coli (E. coli), as a framework. The resulting materials are herein referred to
as armored golden E. coli (AGE) microrods.
Although silica microrods decorated with AuNS showed good performance
with higher conversion efficiency and stable activity during multiple
reactions under NIR irradiation,5 they
should be dispersed in solution phase, before use as the photothermal
agent. To extend the application area, freestanding cellulose-patch
was prepared by mixing and drying of mixture of filter-paper pulp
distributed in water, with AGE microrods. Paper-based preparation
has some advantages, such as cost-effectiveness, easy and simple synthesis,
and mass repetitive production.18 Temperature
monitoring of the surface of the photothermal patch and in water was
analyzed in real time with an IR-camera, and its energy efficiency
was calculated with the heat transfer rate in the region of the cooling
curve.

2 Results and Discussion
Silica microrods
decorated with AuNS were prepared using a three-step
procedure: E. coli with the shape of
microrods was first coated with a silica layer by a modified Stöber
method19 to prepare the silica microrods,
and then, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized AuS was prepared via
the galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) between AgNPs and HAuCl47 and subsequently allowed to adsorb
onto the amine-terminated silica microrods (Figure 1a). The silica microrods were fully covered
with AuNS because of the strong affinity of amine groups to AuNS.

Figure 1 Scheme
of (a) gold-spikes decorated silica microrods prepared using
the E. coli template and (b) assembly
of cellulose-patch of AGE microrods and cellulose-paper pulp.

The optical properties of metallic
plasmonic NPs are readily adjustable
by varying the size, shape, and shell across the NIR regions. While
spherical AuNPs have a plasmonic band at ca. 520 nm in the visible
region,3 AuNPs with rod,20 star,21 or shell22 structures show the red shift of the LSPR band
within the visible and NIR regions. It is known that hot electrons
induced via high EM field enhancements are produced at the junctions
between adjacent metal NPs and at sharp edges in anisotropic nanostructure.23 Namely, spikes on AuNPs act as efficient nanoantennae,
so that high EM fields are generated, giving rise to multiple intrinsic
hot spots within a single NP. Therefore, among these AuNPs with different
shapes, gold-spikes with the shell structure were selected here as
the photothermal agent, working under NIR irradiation.

Figure 2 shows representative
transmission electron microcopy (TEM) images of AuNS and AGE particles
dispersed in aqueous phase. First, E. coli of rod-type was covered with the silica layer (ca. 80 nm of thickness),
and then, silica microrods were used as a vehicle to load the AuNS
NPs. The sizes in the axial/longitudinal direction for silica-coated E. coli and AGE particles were (3076.0/699.6) and
(4156.4/951.5) nm, respectively. Richardson et al. reported that when
AuNPs dispersed in solution were illuminated, the temperature profile
might no longer be localized around each NP because of some thermal
collective effect.24 Although the temperature
can become uniform throughout the NP assembly, it is usually not favorable
for nanoscale applications where localized heating is desired.25 In addition, for the applications of an efficient
and broadband plasmonic absorber, it is desirable to assemble random-sized,
widely anisotropic-shaped AuNPs in close-packed but not aggregated
form.13 When AuNPs are close-packed in
random distribution, the plasmonic band of each AuNP will overlap
and hybridize, leading to multiple overlapping plasmonic modes that
give rise to broadband absorption.26 Whereas,
NPs dispersed in the aqueous phase could easily be aggregated and/or
agglomerated by changing the environmental conditions: pH, temperature,
and salts.27 Therefore, to effectively
absorb light in a wide wavelength range of the NIR region, AuNS with
a rough surface and shell structure was randomly decorated on the
microrod vehicle, to provide a high density of hybridized LSPR feature.

Figure 2 Representative
TEM images of (a) E. coli coated with
the silica layer, (b) AuNS particles, and (c) AGE microrods,
and (d) UV–vis spectra of the AuNS and AGE microrods.

Because AuNS particles were prepared
by the GRR based on AgNPs,
it showed a hollow-shell structure with a rough surface,28 which looks like a hollow roseberry. The particle
size of AuNS measured by TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectroscopy
is ca. (115.9 ± 22.7) and (100.0 ± 22.9) nm (Figure S1). The surface roughness and spiky morphology
of AuNS gives rise to an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
band corresponding to tip plasmon modes.29 Ma et al. reported that Au nanospikes synthesized by the GRR showed
a hollow structure and a representative SPR peak at 670 nm,7 while Au nanostar prepared via a seed-mediated
growth method by Serrano-Montes et al. had a solid structure and showed
an LSPR peak of 785 nm.23 The AuNS particles
prepared in this work have an LSPR peak of 823 nm, as shown in Figure 2d. After decorating
AuNS on silica microrods, a similar optical response was found for
AGE composite, with some differences, such as LSPR red-shift to 873
nm and broadening. This effect might be due to the presence of silica
vehicle, increased refractive index, and plasmon coupling effects
induced from the close proximity between neighboring AuNS on the silica
surface. This trend was also found for the Au nanostar-coated polystyrene
(PS) beads.30 With increasing density of
Au nanostars on PS, the LSPR band represented increasing intensity
and broadening band. Therefore, the AGE microrods prepared herein
could be utilized as a high-efficiency photothermal agent, when AGE
microrods were composited on cellulose-paper.

In the literature,
there are a few reports of photothermal film
or patch of dry-type, but there are few reports of the paper-based
patch, notwithstanding the advantages of lightweight, cheapness, and
ease of preparation. The CuNP hydrogel16 and Au nanohole–graphene oxide patch17 were prepared to evaluate their antibacterial properties and subcutaneous
wound infections, respectively, via photothermal irradiation. Howard
et al. prepared a AuNPs–PVP thin film to use as heat sink via
thermoplasmonic dissipation.31 Liu et al.
tested NIR-responsive elastomer film containing photothermal conjugated
polymer and then confirmed the potential utility for NIR-responsive
shape-memory materials.32 Therefore, to
evaluate the feasibility of AGE particles as dry-type photothermal
agents, AGE microrods were mixed with pulp of cellulose filter-paper
dispersed in water, followed by centrifugation and drying under ambient
conditions, to obtain the cellulose-patch containing AGE (Figure 1b). Figure 3 shows scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images, which reveal the E. coli template treated with 80 v/v % ethanol and sequentially 100 mg/L
of AuNS has maintained its intrinsic rod-structure. AuNS particles
were randomly immobilized on the silica microrods (Figure 3b), and some of the AuNS particles
that were not fixed on the microrods after centrifugation formed agglomerates.
When the stirring time of mixture between paper-pulp and AGE particles
was prolonged, AuNS attached on the silica microrods could be readily
removed by cellulose fibers, like a broom sweeps dust. Therefore,
the agitation time in Figure 1b should be set within 10 min. The color of filter-paper was
changed from white to gray after the addition of AuNS and AGE particles
in cellulose-patch, and its color was gradually darkened with the
added concentration of AGE in patch (Figure 3e). Because the cellulose-patch has gray
or black color, it is suitable to absorb light-energy in the visible
and NIR regions.

with silica layer, and (b) silica microrods decorated with AuNS in

of (c) AuNS and (d) AGE and (e) 600 mg/L of AGE.

The photothermal heating of cellulose-patch containing AGE
microrods
is due to the LSPR phenomena of metallic NPs. As described by the
two-temperature model of photothermal heating,16,33,34 plasmons can be launched via the EM coupling
between incident light and free electrons in metallic NPs. The absorbed
photon energy decays via both radiative and nonradiative damping,
and then, LSPR excitations significantly increase the yield of hot
electrons in the nonradiative process.33 The lattice temperature increases through the coupling between the
hot electrons and phonons of the metal lattice. Finally, the thermal
energy of lattice transfers to the local environment. Because the
thermal equilibrium between plasmonic NPs and the surrounding medium
can be reached within several nanoseconds,3 this light-to-heat conversion is highly efficient via swift relaxation
dynamics.

To confirm the photothermal conversion efficiency
by the cellulose-patch
containing AGE microrods, the change of elevation temperature on the
surface of the patch and in water was measured by an IR-camera. The
cellulose-patch was cut into a small piece (1 cm × 1 cm) and
attached to the outside surface of a cuvette cell with thermal grease,
and then the cuvette was filled with 1 mL of water. The surface of
patch was then irradiated by 808 nm of NIR laser with an energy density
of 1–4 W/cm2. The cellulose-patch containing different
concentrations of AGE microrods (50–300 mg/L) was prepared
to find the optimum concentration of AGE on the patch. Figures S2a and S3a show that the surface temperature of patch (Tpatch) was rapidly increased within 1 min and reached equilibrium
in very short time. The patch containing a concentration of 50, 100,
and 300 mg/L of AGE showed temperature increases of approximately
67, 104, and 115 °C for the initial 1 min, respectively, and
the maximum Tpatch was reached at 105,
148, and 154 °C. When the patch generates heat by the photothermal
effect, the water in the cuvette cell is heated by heat transfer through
its wall. Unlike Tpatch, the water temperature
(Twater) was gradually increased (Figures S2b and S3b) and reached 55, 74, and 75 °C for 50, 100, and 300 mg/L of
AGE, respectively. While the fast temperature increase of Tpatch was due to the direct irradiation of NIR
laser, the gradual elevation of Twater was induced by both the indirect transfer of photothermal heat via
conduction and the large heat capacity of water. Although Tpatch and Twater were increased with the concentration of AGE, the Twater of 100 mg/L AGE was almost the same as that of 300
mg/L AGE. Thus, the AGE in the cellulose-patch was fixed as 100 mg/L
for the following test.

The numerical and experimental investigation
by Baffou et al. showed
that the elevation temperature through plasmonic NPs under illumination
was inversely proportional to the square of the interparticle distance
between neighboring NPs.25 The interparticle
distance between AuNS particles loaded on silica microrods was closer,
compared to AuNS dispersed in solution, and thus, the heating efficiency
by plasmonic-mediated photothermal effect might be enhanced. Herein,
the elevation effect of Tpatch and Twater by AuNS fixed on the silica microrods,
in comparison with that by individually separated AuNS on the patch,
was also tested. While Tpatch and Twater by patch containing AGE showed efficient
photothermal heating (Figure 4), that by the bare filter-paper was less changed, and that
by the patch with AuNS particles reached about two-thirds of the maximum
temperature for patch with AGE. The elevation rate of Twater by patch with AuNS and AGE was 7.2 and 4.9 °C/min,
respectively, during the initial 5 min. It is noted that the photothermal
heating by individual AuNS particles is good, but the heating effect
and rate was larger and faster when the interparticle distance between
neighboring AuNS particles, which were fixed on the silica microrods,
was closer.

Figure 4 Temperature profiles of (a) surface of patch (Tpatch) and (b) inner water (Twater) heated by the plasmonic-mediated photothermal effect with different
patch types (conditions: 100 mg/L of AGE microrods on the patch, under
808 nm irradiation of 2 W/cm2).

With increase of the intensity of the light source, the elevation
temperature of patch surface and water naturally increased because
of the increasing generation of hot electron contributing to photothermal
heating. For 4 W/cm2 of NIR laser, Tpatch was increased to 264 °C with 200 °C/min rate
during the initial 1 min (Figure S4). The
dependence of Tpatch and Twater per watt of NIR laser was 58.8 and 8.5 °C/W,
respectively. As shown in Figure S5, the
thermal decomposition temperature of patches under N2 and
air condition is about 347 and 340 °C, respectively. When the
high-powered laser was irradiated on the patch, the surface of patch
was slightly smudged, resulting in damage to the photothermal agents.
Whereas when 4 W/cm2 powered NIR was irradiated on the
patch surface dipped in the water in the cuvette cell, the photothermal
energy generated from the surface of patch was dissipated to the water,
and thus, damage to the patch structure was not caused. Using this
feature, the experiment for generation of water vapor by the cellulose-patch
was carried out.

It is reported that strong nonradiative plasmon
decay concentrates
light on a nanometer-sized volume, leading to the localized heating
of water, which is favorable for effective steam generation.35,36 However, the generated plasmonic heat was easily and rapidly dissipated
to the environment, and this decay of heat energy is inefficient in
water vapor generation. Therefore, to prevent heat dissipation via
heat transfer from inside water to the outside of the cuvette cell,
the cuvette cell was wrapped with styrene foam as an insulator (Figure 5). The irradiation
power of NIR laser was adjusted from 2 to 4 W/cm2, and
light was focused on the patch surface with 100 mg/L of AGE, located
on the bottom of the cuvette cell with water. In the case of adiabatic
condition with 4 W/cm2 irradiation, the elevation rate
of Twater was 13.5 °C/min, and large
amounts of air bubbles and water vapor were observed in the water
in 5 min (Movie S1). In the nonadiabatic
condition, Twater reached 83 °C (Figure S6) with a rate of 11.0 °C/min, and
a small amount of bubbles and steam were generated (Movie S2). Meanwhile, for 2 W/cm2 irradiation to
the insulated cuvette, the evaporation rate was slightly decreased
to 12.9 °C/min, and a sufficient amount of bubbles and steam
was generated in 5 min (Movie S3); while
for the nonadiabatic condition with 2 W/cm2 irradiation,
less air bubbles were generated (Movie S4). In the literature, AuNPs13 or AlNPs35 assembled in the pores of the porous alumina
substrate were applied for plasmon-enhanced solar desalination at
the air/liquid interface, and ca. 8 kg/m2 of evaporation
rate per 1 h was shown. In our system, the evaporation rate per 1
min for 4 W/cm2 with adiabatic and nonadiabatic conditions
was 19.7 and 10.6 kg/m2·h, respectively (Figure S7). Therefore, when the system is well-insulated
and further expanded, the as-made cellulose-patch with AGE could be
used in the field of steam generation and desalination.

Figure 5 Pictures of
the generation test of water vapor and air bubble in
(a) adiabatic and (b) nonadiabatic conditions (cellulose-patch with
100 mg/L of AGE, 4 W/cm2 irradiation).

To evaluate the photothermal stability of the cellulose-patch
in
air and water, the heating–cooling process over four cycles
was performed by irradiation of 2 W/cm2 (Figure 6). No significant change of
the maximum Tpatch and Twater was observed during four cycles. While Tpatch was rapidly decreased to the ambient temperature
with a cooling rate of 110 °C per 7 min, Twater was gradually decreased and reached 28 °C with a
cooling rate of 50 °C per 20 min. These results demonstrate that
the cellulose-patch has excellent photothermal stability and fast
cooling–heating performance.

Figure 6 Temperature monitoring of (a) the surface
of cellulose-patch with
100 mg/L of AGE and (b) inner water over four cycles of 808 nm laser
irradiation on/off (2 W/cm2).

A continuum energy balance on the heating–cooling
procedure
can be established as the following equation,38 and the photothermal heating efficiency by light-to-heat could be
calculated in the cooling curve. 1  where mi and Cpi are the mass
and heat capacity
of water, cuvette, and patch, respectively, Qin and Qout are the heat transfer
rate from patch-to-water and water-to-air, respectively, h is the total heat transfer coefficient, A is the
surface area of the system, and To is
the ambient temperature. In the cooling period for 20 min, Qin was eliminated because of laser-off. Equation 1 was simplified with
dimensionless constant, θ, as eq 2, integrating as eq 3. 2   3  where τs is the time constant,
which means the ratio between the heat loss (mCp) of water and the total heat transfer (hA) to outside per ΔT. The photothermal
heating efficiency (η) can be determined by eq 4: 4  where I is the applied
power
of light on the patch. When the photothermal NPs was dispersed in
water during NIR irradiation, I should be changed
in the form of I (1 – 10–A), by considering the absorbance (A) of NPs in water.37 In this experimental
configuration, light was directly illuminated on the patch surface
in air as incident power (I), and thus, the denominator
of eq 4 was only considered
as a form of I, that is, it was assumed that all
the energy of the light source was transmitted to the patch.38 The time constant for heat transfer from the
system was determined by applying the linear time data from the cooling
period (20 min), versus the negative natural logarithm of θ.
The specific heat capacity of the patch was calculated as ca. 1.33
J/g·K. The total heat transfer of the patch was obtained from
the cooling curve, and the numerator term in eq 4 represents the thermal energy by photothermal
heating of the patch alone. Thus, the photothermal conversion efficiency
of light-to-heat could be calculated and that of the patch containing
100 mg/L of AGE under 2 W/cm2 of NIR irradiation showed
25.3%.

Table S1 summarizes the conversion
efficiency
according to variables, such as the concentration of AGE, type of
patch, and power density of laser. On increasing the amount of AGE
on the patch, the heating efficiency was increased from 20.6 to 35.8%.
The patch containing individually separated AuNS particles showed
a low efficiency of 24.9%. Note that as shown in the experiment of
photothermal heating, the photothermal efficiency of patch was high
when silica microrods were decorated with AuNS particles. In contrast,
when the power of incident light was increased, the efficiency decreased
due to the energy loss during heat transfer from patch to cell and
water, although Twater rose to a high
temperature. Namely, the excess supply of energy appears to be partially
used for the photothermal heating and the rest to be lost. Evaluation
of the photothermal heating by AGE particles dispersed in water showed
a high heating efficiency of 44.0%.5 Namely,
the heating efficiency of water was decreased, because the thermal
energy of patch induced by the photothermal effect was transferred
to the cuvette and water via conduction. Actually, in test of steam
generation, Twater was increased to 100
°C when NIR was illuminated directly to the patch dipped in the
water. As summarized in Table S2, the heating
efficiency under adiabatic conditions was higher, compared to that
under nonadiabatic conditions. Therefore, the heating efficiency of
indirect heat transfer via conduction from patch-to-water was 35.0%,
while that of direct heat transfer via radiation from patch in water
was 75.2 and 86.1% for nanoadiabatic and -adiabatic conditions, respectively.
The results show that the plasmonic-mediated photothermal patch displayed
a fast heating rate, good stability, high light-to-heat conversion,
and good heating efficiency of water, and thus, it is expected to
be used in the field of desalination or steam generation.

3 Conclusions
The gold-spikes decorated silica microrods (AGE)
based on the unicellular
cell, E. coli template, were synthesized
for photothermal agents, and the cellulose-patch containing AGE microrods
was also successfully prepared. The patch not only demonstrated a
strong SPR band in the NIR region and high photothermal conversion
characteristics, but also exhibited fast heating rate in steam generation.
The as-made cellulose-patch was stable under the irradiation of NIR
laser after four times recycling experiments, and no tendencies to
decrease temperature were observed. For 4 W/cm2 of NIR
laser, the surface temperature of the cellulose-patch with 100 mg/L
of AGE particles was increased to 264 °C with 200 °C/min
rate during the initial 1 min. The fast heating rate and high photothermal
conversion efficiency of the as-made materials are suitable to apply
to steam generation. The experiment for generation of water vapor
was performed and showed fast elevation rate (13.5 °C/min) of Twater and a large amount of air bubbles and
water vapor in the water in 5 min. In addition, as shown in the experiment
of photothermal heating, the photothermal efficiency of the patch
was high when the silica microrods were decorated by AuNS particles,
compared to the patch containing individually separated AuNS particles.
Namely, the interparticle distance between AuNS particles loaded on
silica microrods was closer, compared to the AuS dispersed in solution,
and thus, the heating efficiency by plasmonic-mediated photothermal
effect might be enhanced. Therefore, it is believed that the paper-type
cellulose-patch containing AGE particles provides good potential in
various fields, such as steam generation, desalination, and sterilization,
via photothermal heating.

4 Methods
4.1 AuNS
Synthesis
Hollow and spikelike
gold NPs (gold-spikes) were synthesized by the GRR method between
AgNPs and HAuCl4.7 First, AgNPs
as sacrificial materials were prepared as follows: first, 10 mL of
0.025 M AgNO3 was added to 80 mL of boiling water, followed
by adding 1 wt % trisodium citrate dehydrate. The mixture was boiled
for 20 min and cooled to room temperature. Then, AuNS was prepared
with the as-made AgNP solution, as follows: 5 mL of AgNPs was dispersed
in 25 mL of 3 mM HAuCl4, and 5 mL of 10 mM ascorbic acid
was injected into the resulting solution. To enhance the dispersion
stability in the aqueous phase during storage, 0.1 g/mL of PVP was
added into the final solution at 50 °C for 6 h.

4.2 AGE Synthesis
To form a rod-shaped
nanostructure, unicellular cell, especially E. coli was selected, which was easily cultivated and reproduced. Thus,
using them as frameworks was an adequate strategy for easy modification.
The cell culturing of E. coli followed
the reported protocol,5 and the silica
layer was coated on the E. coli by
a modified Stöber method.19 Then,
10 mL of culturing solution containing E. coli was dispersed in 50 mL of 80 v/v % ethanol solution, followed by
sequentially adding 1 mL of NH4OH and tetraethyl orthosilicate
solution dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 6 h, and the resulting
particles were collected by centrifugation and washed three times
with ethanol. To decorate the AuNS particles on the silica microrods,
amine-functional group was introduced, using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES). First, 1 mL of APTES was slowly added to 40 mL of ethanol
solution of 0.01 g silica microrods, and the mixture was stirred at
50 °C for 12 h. The precipitated particles were separated by
centrifugation and washed three times with ethanol. Then, 20 mL of
amine-functionalized silica microrod solution was added to PVP-coated
AuNS solution (700 mL). After stirring for 12 h, the resulting particles,
AGE, were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with water,
and re-dispersed in water.

4.3 Cellulose-Patch Synthesis
A piece
of filter-paper (Advantec, cellulose) was placed in water and stirred
for 24 h, and then, the paper became loosened, like pulp. The appropriate
concentration (50–300 mg/L) of AGE particles was added to the
pulp solution during just 10 min. The water in the mixture of paper
and AGE was squeezed with centrifugation, and the wet-pulp composite
was spread thinly on a Petridish, and dried for 2 days, making the
white paper with pulp.

4.4 Photothermal Performance
The photothermal
performance was investigated using 808 nm NIR laser with a power density
of 1–4 W/cm2. The cellulose-patch (1 cm × 1
cm) was attached on the outer surface of the cuvette cell containing
1 mL of water using thermal grease (Momentive Performance, YG-6111),
and then, the temperature profile was recorded for 20 min heating
and 20 min cooling through NIR laser on-off. In test of steam generation,
a piece of patch containing 100 mg/L of AGE was located on the bottom
of the cuvette cell with water, and then, the formation of water vapor
and air bubbles was observed. To suppress heat loss from the cuvette
cell to the outside during the heating-cooling procedure, the cuvette
cell was wrapped with styrene foam as an insulator.

4.5 Characterization
The morphology of
AuNS and AGE was analyzed by TEM (JEOL, JEM-2010) and SEM (Hitachi,
SU8010). The particle size distribution dispersed in water was measured
by DLS (Photal, ELS-Z). Their UV–vis absorption spectra were
obtained by spectrophotometry (Shimazdu, UV-1800). The temperature
profiles of patch and water were recorded in real time by an IR-camera
(FLIR System, FLIR ONE).
