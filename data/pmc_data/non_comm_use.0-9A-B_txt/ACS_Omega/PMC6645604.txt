The binding interactions of three
gemini surfactants having different
spacer groups (12-4-12, 12-8-12, and 12-4(OH)-12) with a high concentration
(150 μM) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) at various regions of
binding isotherms have been studied by means of steady-state fluorescence
and fluorescence anisotropy, time-correlated single-photon counting
fluorescence of trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole,
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer phenomenon
between the twisted intramolecular charge transfer fluorescent molecule, trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole as an acceptor,
and tryptophan 213 (Trp-213) of BSA as a donor has been successfully
used to probe the binding interactions of gemini surfactants with
protein at all regions of binding isotherms. The increasing order
of energy transfer efficiency at a higher concentration range of surfactants
is 12-8-12 > 12-4-12 > 12-4(OH)-12. Stronger binding of micelles
of
gemini surfactant molecules having a comparatively more hydrophobic
spacer group with the hydrophobic segments of the protein results
in closer approach of trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole
molecules solubilized in micelles to Trp-213. The average excited-state
lifetimes become shorter with a trend of increase in contribution
from the fast component and decrease in contribution from the slow
component to the decay with increasing concentration of a surfactant.
The nonradiative rate constant of trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole
increases with increasing concentration of a surfactant because the
average microenvironment around it in protein–surfactant aggregates
is more polar as compared to that in native protein. SANS and DLS
measurements were carried out for the study of the structural deformations
in the protein, on enhancement of the concentration of the gemini
surfactants. The necklace and bead model has been used for the analysis
of SANS data for the protein–surfactant complexes. At a higher
concentration range, 12-8-12 and 12-4-12 have a slightly smaller fractal
dimension and a larger correlation length as compared to 12-4(OH)-12.
DLS data show that the increasing order of hydrodynamic diameter for
the complexes of protein with three gemini surfactants in their high
concentration range is 12-4(OH)-12 < 12-4-12 < 12-8-12.

1 Introduction
Protein
is one of the main building blocks of life. Serum albumins
belong to a multigene family of proteins.1 They play major roles in various physiological functions as they
can be found in the human circulatory system. They even contribute
to the osmotic blood pressure and also act as a plasma carrier.2 They also take part in transportation of a variety
of molecules such as some anesthetic drugs, amino acids, fatty acids,
steroids, metabolites, and so on.3 Bovine
serum albumin (BSA) is one such pivotal protein commonly used for
research purposes because of its stability, water solubility, and
flexible binding property. Basically, BSA consists of 583 amino acid
residues in a single polypeptide chain (molecular weight = 66.5 kDa).
It comprises nine loops which are bound together by 17 disulfide bonds,
enclosed in three domains (I, II, and III), each consisting of two
subdomains, A and B. BSA has two tryptophan (Trp) residues at positions
134 and 213 of the amino acid sequence. Tryptophan 134 (Trp-134) is
found in the hydrophilic subdomain, whereas tryptophan 213 (Trp-213)
is present in the hydrophobic core of BSA.4

Protein can interact with different types of ligands such
as fatty
acids, drugs, metal ions, surfactants, and so on.5−8 The study of protein–surfactant
interactions has been an attractive area of research to the scientific
community over the past few decades. This research area covers a variety
of fields starting from the estimation of protein molecular weights
to the preparation of effective washing powder enzymes and other such
products required for personal hygiene. A number of sophisticated
instrumental tools, e.g., circular dichroism,9 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),10 microcalorimetry,11 light scattering,12 small-angle neutron scattering (SANS),13 steady-state and time-dependent fluorescence,14,15 electron spin resonance,16 were witnessed
over a short span of time for more accurate and sophisticated analysis
of protein–surfactant complexes. Apart from its use as a model
system to understand the mechanism of interactions between protein
and ligands in biological systems, the knowledge of behavior of protein–surfactant
interactions is also useful in several applications such as biotechnological
processes, cosmetic systems, detergents, drug delivery, biosciences,17−19 food, biochemistry, and the pharmaceutical industry.20 Surfactants are known to uncoil the original
protein structure. Proteins comprise both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
amino acids and because of this, amino acids allow the surfactant
molecules to bind with the proteins.21 In
many cases, the chemical nature of surfactants governs the interactions
occurring between protein and surfactant molecules. There are several
reports22−25 where intrinsic fluorescence of BSA, that is, Trp fluorescence,
has been employed for the analysis of the structure and dynamics of
BSA and also for the examination of different binding aspects between
protein and surfactant.26

Several
reports detailing the interaction of diverse single-chain
surfactants with protein are available. In recent times, a special
category of surfactants called gemini surfactants has garnered tremendous
significance as compared to conventional monomeric surfactants.27 A gemini surfactant molecule possesses at least
two ionic or polar headgroups and two hydrophobic chains connected
by a spacer group at their heads.28 A spacer
group can be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, flexible or rigid.28 The nature of spacer groups controls the aggregation
behavior and thermodynamics of micellization of gemini surfactants.29,30 An ionic headgroup may have positive (ammonium) or negative (phosphate,
sulfate, carboxylate) charge, whereas a nonionic headgroup can be
polyether or sugar. A vast majority of gemini surfactants have symmetrical
structures with two identical chains and two identical headgroups.
A gemini with two Cm (Cm is the number of alkyl carbon atoms) tails and an s (s is the number of alkyl carbon atoms)
spacer separating the quaternary nitrogen atoms may be represented
as Cm-s-Cm. The present study deals with the binding interactions
of gemini surfactants of varying spacer groups with protein, BSA.

Recently, charge transfer probe molecules have been widely explored
for their high responsiveness in order to interpret the binding interactions
between protein and probe and also to probe the uncoiling of protein
by various denaturing agents.31,32 De et al.33 investigated the interactions between BSA and
three different monomeric surfactants, namely, sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, and TX-100, using an external
fluorescent probe, 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate, by utilizing
the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) fluorescence properties.
Mukherjee and his group used a probe, ethyl p-(dimethylamino)cinnamate,
showing charge transfer fluorescence to study protein–SDS interactions.34 Ghosh et al.35 explored trans-3-(4-monomethylaminophenyl)-acrylonitrile as a charge
transfer fluorescent probe for the study of binding of the probe to
BSA. They located the exact binding site of the probe using silver
nanoparticles with the support of molecular docking. In the present
study, the protein–gemini surfactant interactions in different
zones of binding isotherms have been probed exploring the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a TICT fluorescent probe, trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole (DMASBT)
(Scheme 1), and BSA.
The study reveals that Trp-213, located in the hydrophobic domain
of BSA, acts as a donor and DMASBT acts as an acceptor. Gemini surfactants
used in this study are 12-4-12, 12-4(OH)-12, and 12-8-12 (Scheme 1). The effect of
the chemical nature of the spacer group on interactions between gemini
surfactant and BSA has been studied. Earlier, we had studied BSA–SDS
interactions probed with FRET between DMASBT and BSA. In the present
study, we have shown how FRET data corroborate well with the other
fluorescence data such as fluorescence intensity and anisotropy. FRET
data also have been used to support the effect of the spacer group
on binding interactions. In addition to using the FRET method, we
have also explored SANS and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements
to highlight the microstructures of protein–surfactant complexes.36,37 The neutron-scattering data on interactions between lithium dodecyl
sulfate (LDS) and BSA were analyzed based on the “necklace
and bead” model of protein–surfactant aggregates in
which LDS micelles were distributed along the polypeptide chain.36 A recent study of SANS analysis36,37 on BSA and OVA (ovalbumin) complexes with SDS has inferred that
the necklace and bead structure of protein surfactant aggregates is
the reason behind the scattering behavior of the system. To have proper
scattering signals in SANS measurements, we had to perform experiments
with high concentration of BSA (1 wt %, i.e., 150 μM). When
doing this study with a high concentration of BSA, we found some differences
as compared to our previous study with a low concentration of BSA.38 With a high concentration of BSA, we have found
the expulsion of some percentage of DMASBT molecules from beads, that
is, micelles with the addition of a high concentration of gemini surfactants.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of DMASBT and Gemini Surfactant Molecules
2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Binding of DMASBT with
BSA
2.1.1 Absorption and Steady-State Fluorescence
Emission of DMASBT in BSA
DMASBT shows a broad and structureless
absorption band in (4-(2-hydroxyethyl))-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) buffer maintained at pH 7.4, thereby displaying a peak
maximum at 402 nm. A wide, unstructured fluorescence band is observed
having an emission maximum at 505 nm in aqueous HEPES buffer solution
(pH = 7.4) upon excitation at 370 nm. It is to be noted that at this
excitation wavelength, DMASBT molecules only selectively get excited
without exciting BSA. Hardly any change in absorption spectra is noted
in the presence of BSA. However, fluorescence spectra of DMASBT are
immensely affected with variation in the concentration of BSA. Figure 1 demonstrates the
changes in the fluorescence intensity of DMASBT as the concentration
of BSA is increased. In our previous study, we recorded similar spectra
up to 125 μM concentration of BSA.39 However, in the present case, spectra have been taken up to 200
μM BSA because denaturation of BSA by the gemini surfactant
has been studied for 150 μM BSA. The alterations in the fluorescence
peak maxima of DMASBT with enhancement in BSA concentration are represented
by Figure 1 (inset).
It is noteworthy that the hydrodynamic radius of native BSA at 150
μM (discussed in Section 2.6) is found to be ∼4.1 nm. It is in good agreement
with the reported value of 4.0 nm.40 The
hydrodynamic radius of native BSA at 5 μM is measured as ∼4.1
nm. The reported hydrodynamic radius of native BSA at 15 μM
is 3.8 nm.41 Thus, the hydrodynamic radius
of native BSA at a low concentration is very close to that at 150
μM within the limit of experimental error. Therefore, we can
assume that there is as such no aggregation of protein molecules at
the high concentration chosen in the present study.

of DMASBT (5 μM) as a function of concentration
of BSA. Inset: Variation in fluorescence peak maxima of DMASBT as
a function of concentration of BSA (λex = 370 nm).

It has been reported in the literature
that the intensity of fluorescence
of DMASBT that occurs from the TICT state in a polar environment is
low because of the high rates of nonradiative processes.42 As the protein concentration is gradually increased,
a greater number of DMASBT molecules reside in a region of lower polarity,
that is, the hydrophobic region. As a result, fluorescence intensity
is increased with a blue shift in fluorescence peak maximum. Fluorescence
band maximum of DMASBT gets blue-shifted by 30 nm at 110 μM
BSA as compared to the buffer solution. The stoichiometry of the complex
between BSA and DMASBT and binding constant, K, determined
from the Benesi–Hildebrand plot43,44 (see Note
1 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information for details) are found to be 1:1 and 15561 M–1, respectively, at 298.15 K. The standard Gibbs-free energy change
(ΔG°) calculated using the K value was −24 kJ mol–1 at 298.15 K. The
spontaneity of binding is represented by the negative value of ΔG°.45

2.1.2 Steady-State Fluorescence Anisotropy of
DMASBT in BSA
Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy experiments
were performed in order to inspect the motional restriction imparted
by the protein on the DMASBT molecule. The changes in fluorescence
anisotropy (r) with increasing concentration of BSA
is represented by Figure S2. The fluorescence
anisotropy rises with the gradual increase in the concentration of
BSA, thereby denoting that the flexibility of the environment around
DMASBT decreases as it binds with BSA. The effective binding of DMASBT
with the protein is confirmed by a significantly large fluorescence
anisotropy value of 0.37 at 50 μM BSA.

2.2 Unfolding of BSA by Gemini Surfactants Probed
by DMASBT
The fluorescence spectra of DMASBT in aqueous HEPES
buffer solution of 150 μM BSA with increasing concentration
of each of the three gemini surfactants have been recorded. The fluorescence
spectra for 12-8-12 are represented by Figure 2. Similar fluorescence spectra are observed
with the other two gemini surfactants, 12-4-12 and 12-4(OH)-12, as
well. The concentration range chosen for each surfactant has started
from a concentration much below the critical micelle concentration
(cmc) and goes up to a concentration much above the cmc, that is,
0–20 mM. The cmc values of 12-4-12, 12-4(OH)-12, and 12-8-12
reported earlier are 1.17, 0.96, and 0.72 mM, respectively.46,47Figure 3a demonstrates
the changes in TICT fluorescence intensity ratios (F/Fo) of DMASBT at 475 nm as the concentration
of each of the three gemini surfactants varies. With increase in the
concentration of a surfactant, fluorescence intensity initially increases
and then decreases. After reaching a minimum, again it starts increasing
and attains a maximum. Thereafter, once again it starts decreasing.
The concomitant changes in fluorescence peak maximum are represented
by Figure 3b.

fluorescence spectra of DMASBT (5 μM) with variation
of concentration of 12-8-12 (0–50 mM) in 150 μM BSA.

Figure 3 (a) F/Fo, (b) fluorescence
peak maximum (λmaxfl), and (c) steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) of DMASBT with varying concentrations of gemini surfactants
(-■-■- 12-4-12, (red)-□-□- 12-8-12, (green)-□-□-
12-4(OH)-12). [DMASBT] = 5 μM, [BSA] = 150 μM, λexc = 370 nm, λem = 480 nm. The insets in
(a,b) show changes more clearly at a low concentration range.

Initially, at a very low concentration,
a few surfactant molecules
bind to the high-energy binding sites of BSA. It has been reported
in the literature that this specific binding makes the protein structure
more compact.34 As a result, DMASBT molecules
experience a comparatively less polar environment, leading to increase
in TICT fluorescence intensity (Figure 3a). DLS measurements were performed for BSA–gemini
complexes with 0.1 mM of each of the three surfactants. The hydrodynamic
diameters of these complexes are found to be 8.1 and 7.9 nm for 12-4-12
and 12-4(OH)-12, respectively, as compared to 8.3 nm for the native
protein. The data are indicating the compactness of the protein structure
with a low concentration of surfactant, expecting that the changes
in sizes should be low. However, we did not notice any significant
change for 12-8-12, which could be because a surfactant with a long
spacer chain interacts less effectively at a low concentration range
with the protein.38 Therefore, the effect
on fluorescence intensity because of a slightly higher hydrophobicity
imparted to the native BSA as a result of binding of a few surfactant
molecules cannot be ruled out. On further increase in the concentration
of surfactant, the protein molecules get unfolded. The probe molecules,
DMASBT, get exposed to the polar environment because of noncooperative
binding of the surfactant. Because of this, there is a gradual reduction
in the fluorescence intensity with a notable red shift in the fluorescence
band (Figure 3b). Having
attained a minimum intensity at ∼2.5 mM gemini surfactant,
there is a massive cooperative binding of the gemini surfactant molecules
with BSA in the form of micelles giving necklace and bead kind of
structures.48,49 DMASBT molecules solubilized
in these micelles experience a comparatively less polar environment,
resulting in enhancement of fluorescence intensity (Figure 3a) with a slight hypsochromic
shift (Figure 3b).
In contrast to the observation with a low concentration of BSA,38 in the present case, with a high concentration
of BSA, the decrease in fluorescence intensity noted at a high concentration
of a surfactant is because a few DMASBT molecules get expelled into
the bulk aqueous phase.

To further demonstrate the binding interactions
of gemini surfactants
with BSA protein, the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy measurements
have been accomplished.50Figure 3c represents the variation
in steady-state fluorescence anisotropy (r) of DMASBT
at a fixed concentration of BSA (150 μM) with an increasing
concentration of each of the three gemini surfactants. With denaturation
of protein, the anisotropy is decreased as the probe molecules are
exposed to the comparatively less rigid environment. The tumbling
motions of DMASBT molecules become feasible. After reaching a minimum,
fluorescence anisotropy starts increasing in the cooperative massive
binding region of surfactant molecules as the DMASBT molecules start
getting solubilized in a rigid environment in micelles formed along
the protein chain. Beyond this region, fluorescence anisotropy is
decreased as DMASBT gets expelled.

To check to what extent the
change in fluorescence intensity is
correlated with the change in fluorescence anisotropy, we have overlaid
these plots in Figure 4 for 12-8-12 as a representative one. The same is done for the other
two surfactants as well. The change in fluorescence anisotropy corroborates
quite well with the change in fluorescence intensity except at a certain
concentration range of surfactant. Figure 4 depicts some random changes in fluorescence
anisotropy in a noncooperative interaction zone. Such an alteration
in anisotropy would reflect that the random change in conformation
of protein is taking place when the surfactant molecules noncooperatively
bind with the protein. The flexibility of the binding environment
surrounding DMASBT is expected to be altered with a conformational
change of protein. The two other gemini surfactants, 12-4-12 and 12-4(OH)-12,
show similar changes as well. Protein conformational changes upon
binding with various molecules have been reported in the literature.51 The results show that fluorescence anisotropy
of DMASBT is quite sensitive toward the alterations in the microenvironment,
thereby allowing it to probe this conformational change of protein
molecules. The commonly used probe, pyrene, lacks this ability.52 It is to be noted that the fluorescence anisotropy
value of DMASBT in BSA–12-8-12 aggregates is comparatively
higher (0.27) than that in the system containing pure micelles of
12-8-12 (0.23) at its 20 mM concentration. Also, the emission peak
maximums of DMASBT in BSA–12-8-12 aggregates and in protein-free
micelles of 12-8-12 are 473 and 518 nm, respectively, at 20 mM 12-8-12.
Thus, DMASBT in a protein–surfactant system encounters a comparatively
hydrophobic and rigid environment, as 12-8-12 micelles remain swathed
by the protein chain, leading to the formation of necklace and bead
kind of structures. Further, the fluorescence anisotropy of DMASBT
in BSA-12-8-12 aggregates with a low concentration of 12-8-12 is comparatively
greater than that in BSA-12-4-12 and BSA-12-4(OH)-12 systems. This
is because the micelles of 12-8-12 surfactant molecules residing along
the protein chain bestow a relatively more rigid environment to the
fluorophore because of the longer spacer group as compared to 12-4-12
and 12-4(OH)-12.44 Thus, the BSA–gemini
surfactant complex, characterized by TICT fluorescence properties
of DMASBT, accords quite well with the necklace and bead model.53

anisotropies

μM, λex = 370 nm.

2.3 Fluorescence Lifetimes of DMASBT in BSA–Gemini
Surfactant Aggregate Systems
Fluorescence lifetimes of DMASBT
have been recorded in BSA–gemini surfactant systems at their
various regions of binding isotherms. The fluorescence lifetime of
DMASBT in pure water is very short, which could not be measured as
it is beyond our instrument’s detection limit.54 DMASBT possesses a short lifetime in aqueous medium because
there is a high rate of nonradiative processes occurring between the
emitting TICT state and the triplet state as well as the ground state.55 However, we could measure the lifetime in a
proteinous environment as on an average the microenvironment around
DMASBT is nonpolar as compared to bulk water. As a result, the emitting
state gets destabilized and the rates of nonradiative processes diminished.
To have decays selectively from DMASBT in native BSA and also in BSA–surfactant
systems, it was excited at 375 nm and decays were recorded at 510
nm. BSA neither has any absorbance at 375 nm nor has any emission
at 510 nm. Decays of DMASBT are mostly biexponential in native BSA
as well as in BSA–surfactant systems. Many other groups have
reported a multiexponential decay of different types of probes in
a proteinous environment.56 The lifetimes
of decay components along with their weightage are given in Tables 1–3 for DMASBT (10 μM) in BSA
(150 μM)–12-4-12, BSA (150 μM)–12-4(OH)-12,
and BSA (150 μM)–12-8-12 systems, respectively. The average
excited-state lifetime for a biexponential decay has been calculated
using eq 1 1  where τ1 and τ2 are
the lifetimes of the two components, and a1 and a2 are the corresponding
pre-exponential factors, respectively.52

The radiative and nonradiative
rate constants were calculated using eqs 2 and 3, respectively 2   3  where τ, Φf, and kr and knr denote
singlet state lifetime, fluorescence quantum yield, and radiative
and nonradiative rate constants, respectively. kr and knr data obtained are also
given in Tables 1–3. The data show that in native BSA as well as in
BSA–surfactant systems, the fast component has a major contribution
than slow components toward the decay. As compared to native BSA,
the lifetimes of both fast and slow components in BSA–surfactant
aggregates with 0.5 mM of each of the three surfactants increase.
This could be because of specific binding of surfactants making the
environment of DMASBT more nonpolar. Beyond this concentration, the
lifetimes of both the components become shorter. There is a trend
of increase in contribution from the fast component and decrease in
contribution from the slow component with increasing concentration
of a surfactant. As a result, the average lifetimes become shorter
with increasing concentration of a surfactant. The data also show
that the nonradiative rate constant increases with increasing concentration
of a surfactant. All these results are in support of the fact that
the average microenvironment around DMASBT in BSA–surfactant
aggregates is more polar as compared to that of native BSA. The expulsion
of DMASBT molecules from the hydrophobic environment of protein supports
our abovementioned observation of decrease in fluorescence intensity
with increasing concentration of surfactant at their higher concentration
range.

2.4 Fluorescence (Förster’s) Resonance
Energy Transfer
In the current work, we have demonstrated
the binding interactions of all three gemini surfactants with BSA
by carrying out a FRET study. FRET is an electrodynamic phenomenon
involving radiationless energy transfer taking place between two dye
molecules. It is applicable in different innovative fields of research.57−59 Energy is transferred from a donor to an acceptor through dipole–dipole
interaction without the emission of a photon. As a result, the donor
molecule’s fluorescence gets quenched, and the acceptor molecule
becomes excited with increase in fluorescence intensity.60 As per Förster’s theory, the main
factors that control the FRET efficiency are as follows: (i) the magnitude
of overlap between the donor fluorescence and the acceptor absorption,
(ii) the distance between the donor and the acceptor (acceptable range
is 0.002–0.01 μm),61 and (iii)
the correct manner in which the transition dipoles of the donor and
the acceptor molecules remain oriented.50 Trp-134 and Trp-213 in BSA may behave as donors in energy transfer
to DMASBT (acceptor). The BSA was excited at 280 nm. According to
literature reports,62,63 at this excitation, the fluorescence
often arises mostly from the Trp moieties. The spectral overlap occurring
between the emission spectrum of the donor (BSA) and the absorption
spectrum of the acceptor (DMASBT) is displayed in Figure 5. This is the main basis for
the resonance energy transfer.

Figure 5 Overlap of emission spectrum of BSA with
absorption spectrum of
DMASBT in HEPES buffer; [BSA] = 150 μM and [DMASBT] = 10 μM.

In order to demonstrate the FRET
in various systems, many experiments
have been conducted by enhancing the DMASBT concentration at a fixed
concentration of BSA and each of three gemini surfactants. These experiments
have also been done with various different concentrations of gemini
surfactants in the entire range of the binding isotherm. Figure 6 represents the gradual
changes in the fluorescence spectra of the acceptor (DMASBT, peak
maximum at ∼472 nm) and the donor (Trp in BSA) through the
isoemissive point at ∼428 nm with the variation of concentration
of DMASBT. The concentration of each of the three gemini surfactants
present in solution was 5 mM (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information for spectra in the presence of 10 mM
surfactants). Figure 7 represents the changes in the fluorescence intensities of the donor
and the acceptor for a noncooperative binding zone of surfactants.
This behavior is a manifestation of the FRET between BSA and DMASBT.64,65 It is pertinent to note from Figure 6 that the fluorescence band corresponding to Trp residues
of BSA gets blue-shifted as the concentration of DMASBT is increased.
It should be noted that whereas the fluorescence peak maximum of Trp
residues in free BSA is found at 352 nm, the same in the presence
of 10 μM of DMASBT is located at 348 nm. It depicts that DMASBT
molecules provide a hydrophobic microenvironment around the Trp residues
of BSA.66 It also indicates that the DMASBT
molecule is present closer to the Trp-213 residue in comparison to
the Trp-134, conceptualizing that the environment of Trp-134 is quite
hydrophilic.67 These results also indicate
that the probable donor–acceptor couple is Trp-213–DMASBT.

25 μM, λex = 280 nm.

Figure 7 Decrement in fluorescence intensity of donor (Trp in BSA) with
concomitant enhancement in fluorescence intensity of acceptor (DMASBT)
with increasing concentration of DMASBT in the FRET process in the
BSA–gemini system with 5 mM gemini surfactant and 150 μM
BSA.

For the quantitative analysis
of the FRET phenomenon, the Fürster’s
distance (Ro), the actual distance (r) between DMASBT and Trp residues of BSA, and the efficiency
of energy transfer (ET) for native BSA,
noncooperative, cooperative, and saturated binding regions of BSA–gemini
surfactant (all three) systems have been calculated.56,68 The details of calculation of all these parameters are given as
Note 2 in the Supporting Information and
the values are tabulated in Table 4. The Ro value is found
out to be 2.45 nm for native BSA. This calculated Ro value complies with the literature report.56 The ET value for
native BSA is calculated to be 0.28. The distance r is 2.87 nm for native BSA. The data clearly indicate that DMASBT
resides in close proximity to the Trp moiety. The Ro values calculated for different concentrations of gemini
surfactants are in the range of 2.35–2.54 nm, which is in good
agreement with the range (2.0–9.0 nm) for the occurrence of
FRET.50Figure 8a,b shows the changes in ET and r, respectively, with the variation
in the concentration of gemini surfactants in the entire range of
the binding isotherm. The trends are well corroborated with the changes
in fluorescence intensity and anisotropy as discussed above. One can
see from these figures that while there is a specific binding, the ET increases with a sharp decrease in r. We know that the compactness of BSA increases in this
region. Therefore, the distance between the donor and the acceptor
decreases, causing an increase in energy transfer efficiency. In the
noncooperative binding region, the energy transfer efficiency decreases
with a change in the rate of decrease in r. In case
of 12-4-12, in fact there is an increase in the value of r. In the cooperative binding region, the energy transfer efficiency
again increases with a concomitant decrease in donor–acceptor
distance. Strikingly, FRET takes place between BSA and DMASBT even
in the uncoiled state of BSA. It symbolizes that DMASBT is acting
as a surface probe.49 It resides at the
surface of micelles and is situated at a proper distance from Trp
moiety for resonance energy transfer to take place with the wrapping
up of the protein chains around the micelles. It can be seen from Figure 8a that the energy
transfer efficiency is minimum in the absence of any gemini surfactant.
In this case, Trp moiety is located quite far away from the DMASBT
molecule.

distance (r) between Trp residue of BSA and DMASBT

The effect of the alkyl
spacer chain length of gemini surfactants
on the binding interactions with BSA can be explained based on energy
transfer data. More or less, the increasing order of energy transfer
efficiency is 12-8-12 > 12-4-12 > 12-4(OH)-12. It depicts that
the
energy transfer efficiency increases with increasing hydrophobicity
of the spacer group. Micelles formed by gemini surfactant molecules
with a comparatively more hydrophobic spacer group can bind with the
protein effectively. DMASBT molecules solubilized in these micelles
can approach Trp-213 more closely. One can also see from Figure 8a that the energy
transfer efficiency in the cooperative binding region increases sharply
up to ∼10 mM concentration of each of the three gemini surfactants.
However, the rate of increase in energy transfer efficiency decreases
beyond this concentration range. This might indicate that up to 10
mM concentration of surfactant, micelles are formed along the protein
chain; beyond that, the aggregation number of micelles only increases.
Thus, the binding interactions of gemini surfactants with BSA have
been successfully probed by the FRET study.

2.5 SANS
Study
The formation of structures
of BSA–surfactant complexes when these two components interact
with each other has been studied using SANS technique. In SANS, one
usually measures the differential scattering cross section as a function
of wave vector transfer [Q = (4π sin θ)/λ],
which can be given as below (eq 4)69 4  where φ is the volume fraction of the
scatterer, V is the volume of the individual scatterer,
and ρp and ρs are scattering length
densities of particles and solvent, respectively. P(Q) is the intraparticle structure factor which
decides the geometry of the particles69 and S(Q) is the interparticle
structure factor which originates from the interparticle interactions70 (see Note 3 in the Supporting Information for details).

The SANS data of the pure BSA
solution have been analyzed using an oblate ellipsoidal model, and
BSA molecules are found to have semiminor and semimajor axes of 13.0
and 42.0 Å, respectively, consistent with the values reported
by others.70 On the other hand, data of
pure micelles are fitted by P(Q)
of prolate ellipsoidal, whereas S(Q) is calculated by utilizing the Hayter Penfold method for charged
spheres interacting via screened Coulomb interactions.71 As representative values, the semiminor and
semimajor axes of micelles of 20 mM 12-4-12 are found to be 12.4 and
28.5 Å, respectively. The SANS data corresponding to the interaction
of the two components are shown in Figure 9. These measurements were performed at a
fixed concentration of BSA (150 μM) and varying concentrations
of gemini surfactants. The data are collected only for a higher concentration
range of surfactants as the scattering signals are very low at a lower
concentration range. It can be observed from Figure 9 that the data for surfactant concentrations
up to 20 mM show a linearity in the intermediate Q range, which is characteristic of the formation of the necklace
and bead structures. These necklace and bead complexes are usually
characterized by fractal structures where the fractal dimensions represent
the degree of the formation of the complexes.70 The cutoffs of the linear range of the data at low and high Q values are related to the formation of the extent of the
complex and the size of the individual micelles in the complex, respectively.
The slope of the scattering data evaluated on the log–log scale
is useful for the determination of the value of the fractal dimension, D (Note 3 in the Supporting Information), of the complex. This feature of the linearity in the scattering
profile can be seen for all the three gemini surfactants and the slope
of the linearity changes with surfactant concentration, suggesting
the changes in the fractal dimension with concentration, in all three
cases. The fitted parameters are listed in Tables 5 and 6. It can be
seen from the tables that correlation length increases whereas the
fractal dimension decreases with increasing surfactant concentration,
indicating the formation of a larger and more open structure. At a
higher concentration (50 mM) of surfactant, the linearity in the data
disappears and one can observe the emergence of a correlation peak,
which is a signature of interacting micelles suggesting the existence
of excessive individual micelles. Therefore, these data have been
analyzed by combining the scattering contributions of the fractal
complexes of protein and surfactant and free individual micelles.

2.6 Dynamic Light Scattering
The details
about the dimensional changes of BSA protein upon addition of gemini
surfactant in aqueous buffer solution have been obtained using the
DLS technique. In DLS, the fluctuations in the intensity of scattered
light are measured as a function of time.72 These fluctuations happened because of the Brownian motion of the
particles randomly colliding with each other. Small particles undergo
swift diffusion leading to fast fluctuations, whereas large particles
and aggregates yield comparatively slow fluctuations. The rate of
the fluctuations may be calculated using the method of autocorrelation
analysis. The analysis of intensity fluctuations helps in the determination
of the diffusion constant (D), which can then be
transformed to an effective hydrodynamic size using the Stoke–Einstein
relation (eq 5) 5  where D is the translational
diffusion coefficient, η is the viscosity coefficient, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and Rh is the hydrodynamic radius.

The sizes
of particles such as BSA–surfactant aggregates at a higher
concentration range of all three surfactants have been measured. DLS
plots for systems with 150 μM BSA (1 wt % BSA) plus various
concentrations of surfactants are shown in Figure 10. One can observe the systematic broadening
of the intensity autocorrelation function with increasing surfactant
concentration in Figure 10. The analysis clearly indicates that all the data, fitted
to the single diffusion coefficient for the protein–surfactant
complex, are independent of the surfactant concentration. The effective
hydrodynamic diameters obtained from the data are tabulated in Table 7. There is an increase
in size with an increase in surfactant concentration, which is due
to progressive uncoiling of the protein chain. The diffusion coefficient
(being inversely proportional to the hydrodynamic radius) diminishes
with the increase of surfactant in the complex. This might happen
either when the surfactant molecules bind as individuals or when the
micellelike clusters are formed with the protein. There remains a
significant difference between intensity autocorrelation function
for pure BSA and the BSA–gemini complexes. It is noteworthy
that by and large the increasing order of hydrodynamic size obtained
for the three gemini surfactants in the concentration range 5–20
mM is as follows: 12-4(OH)-12 < 12-4-12 < 12-8-12, which indicates
the formation of larger aggregates of protein with the gemini surfactant
having a spacer group of greater hydrophobicity.

3 Conclusions
The binding interactions of a TICT fluorescent probe, DMASBT with
the native protein, BSA and different BSA–gemini surfactant
aggregates have been studied. The changes in fluorescence properties
of DMASBT with changing the microenvironment have been explored to
study the binding interactions of gemini surfactants with varying
spacer groups at different binding isotherms. The fluorescence lifetimes
and radiative and nonradiative rate constants of DMASBT have been
measured at different regions of binding isotherms. The lifetimes
of both the decay components in a biexponential decay become shorter
with a trend of increase in contribution from the fast component and
decrease in contribution from the slow component with increasing concentration
of a surfactant. Thus, the average lifetimes become shorter with increasing
concentration of a surfactant. The nonradiative rate constant increases
with increasing concentration of a surfactant. The average microenvironment
around DMASBT in BSA–surfactant aggregates is more polar as
compared to that in native BSA. BSA–gemini surfactants’
binding interactions at various binding isotherms have been probed
by the FRET phenomenon between Trp-213 of BSA as a donor and DMASBT
as a potential acceptor. The energy transfer efficiency is minimum
in native protein. It increases in the presence of a low concentration
of gemini surfactant as the donor and acceptor moieties come closer
to each other because of specific binding. At a higher concentration
of surfactant, energy transfer efficiency decreases as a result of
unfolding of protein. The increasing order of energy transfer efficiency
at a higher concentration range of surfactants is 12-8-12 > 12-4-12
> 12-4(OH)-12. Micelles of gemini surfactant molecules with a comparatively
more hydrophobic spacer group can bind with the hydrophobic segments
of the protein more strongly. DMASBT molecules solubilized in these
micelles can approach Trp-213 more closely. SANS and DLS measurements
have been carried out to study the structural changes in the protein,
BSA, on increasing concentration of the gemini surfactants. SANS data
well assist the necklace and bead model for the formation of micelles
along the protein chain. The fractal dimension reduces, whereas the
overall size of the protein–surfactant complexes enhances with
increasing concentration of surfactant. At a higher concentration
range, 12-8-12 and 12-4-12 have a slightly smaller fractal dimension
and larger correlation length as compared to 12-4(OH)-12, indicating
formation of better micellar aggregates along the unfolded protein
chain in the former two cases. It could be due to the greater hydrophobicity
of the spacer groups of the former two surfactants as compared to
the latter one. DLS data show that by and large the increasing order
of hydrodynamic diameter of the BSA–surfactant aggregates for
the three gemini surfactants in the concentration range 5–20
mM is as follows: 12-4(OH)-12 < 12-4-12 < 12-8-12. It indicates
the formation of larger aggregates of protein with the gemini surfactant
having a spacer group of greater hydrophobicity.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Gemini surfactants, 12-4-12,
12-8-12 and 12-4(OH)-12, were synthesized following a reported method.73,74 The synthesized compounds were then recrystallized quite a number
of times using a mixture of methanol and ethyl acetate, and then their
structures were confirmed by FT-IR and 1H NMR data.46 BSA was purchased from Sigma Chemical Company
and used as received. The concentration of the protein, BSA, for all
measurements was kept fixed at 1 wt % (150 μM). DMASBT was obtained
from Aldrich Chemical Company (WI, USA). Its recrystallization process
and purity inspection have been reported earlier.75 HEPES was obtained from SRL, India. Ludox (aqueous solution)
was procured from Aldrich Chemical Co. In time-correlated single-photon
counting (TCSPC) measurements, the Ludox solution was used for recording
the lamp profile.

4.2 Methods
Freshly
prepared buffer solution
was used for sample preparation. NaOH and H2SO4, used for pH adjustments of the buffer solution, were purchased
from Merck, India. HEPES buffer solution (0.05 M) was prepared using
Milli-Q water with an adjustment of pH 7.4. HEPES buffer was used
to prepare BSA solutions. A 0.5 mM DMASBT solution was prepared as
stock in pure methanol in order to record UV–vis absorption
and fluorescence spectra. In order to prepare solutions of varying
concentrations of BSA with a particular concentration of DMASBT, 0.02
mL of a methanol solution of DMASBT was mixed with the required amount
of an aqueous solution of BSA. The final volume of this solution was
adjusted to 2 mL. For the FRET study, 120 mM of solution of each of
the three gemini surfactants was prepared as stock in HEPES buffer.
Then, the concentration of DMASBT was consequently increased by adding
required volumes from the stock solution to the buffer solution of
BSA and surfactant, and the final volume was adjusted to 2 mL. Solutions
were prepared for different concentrations of surfactants. The fluorescence
quantum yields were calculated, with respect to that of quinine sulfate
in 0.1 N H2SO4, as 0.55. A JASCO (model V-650)
UV–vis spectrophotometer was used for absorption measurements
and FluoroMax-4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon) spectrofluorimeter was used for
steady-state emission measurements. Every fluorescence spectrum was
corrected for instrument sensitivity. The slit width for both the
slits was set at 3 nm for fluorescence measurements. The same spectrofluorimeter
with a polarizer attachment was used for fluorescence anisotropy measurements.
Its details can be found elsewhere.52,58 Fluorescence
lifetimes were measured from time-resolved intensity decay following
the method of TCSPC using a FluoroCube-01-NL (Horiba Jobin Yvon) picosecond
instrument. The light source was a picosecond diode laser (NanoLED
375L, IBH, U.K.) of wavelength 375 nm. Fluorescence decays were recorded
at a given wavelength at a magic angle of 54.7° with a vertical
excitation beam using a TBX photon detection module (TBX-07C). The
typical instrument response function after deconvolution using a liquid
scatterer was ∼165 ps for the 375 nm laser. The fluorescence
decays were analyzed by IBH DAS6 software. In order to measure the
lifetime of DMASBT in protein and protein–gemini surfactant
solutions, the analysis of emission decay curves was performed with
a biexponential fitting using an iterative program supported by IBH.
The quality of fitting was confirmed by χ2 value
as well as an examination of the fitted function residuals to the
data. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (298.15
5 ± 1 K).

Samples for SANS experiments were prepared by
dissolving a known amount of BSA and gemini surfactants in a buffer
solution which is prepared in D2O. Use of D2O as solvent instead of H2O provides better contrast and
low incoherent background in cases when we are dealing with hydrogenous
components in neutron scattering experiments. The experiments were
performed using the SANS diffractometer at the Dhruva Reactor, Bhabha
Atomic Research Centre, Trombay, Mumbai, India.76 The mean wavelength of the incident neutron beam was 5.2
Å, with a wavelength resolution of approximately 10%. The scattered
neutrons were detected using a one-dimensional 3He detector.
The samples were kept in a quartz cell of thickness 2 mm and the temperature
of the experiments was kept fixed at 303.15 ± 1 K throughout
the measurements. The measured SANS data were corrected and then normalized
to a cross-sectional unit using standard procedures.

DLS is
a suitable technique complementing SANS, which gives necessary
size description through the measurement of the diffusion coefficient
of the complex and the Brownian motion in the system. DLS measurements
were carried out using an SZ-100 particle size analyzer (Horiba, Japan)
having a 10 mW-diode-pumped solid-state laser having a wavelength
of 532 nm. The temperature throughout all the measurements was uniformly
kept at 303.15 ± 1 K.
