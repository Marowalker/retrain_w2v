The
separation of p-xylene from its bulkier m-xylene and o-xylene is of great importance
in the petrochemical industry. This paper presents the experimental
results of the separation of xylene isomers using a zeolite carbon
composite membrane in a pervaporation system. The preparation method
involves the use of an inexpensive carbon precursor, sucrose, to avoid
the lengthy conventional preparation methods used in the literature
(e.g., hydrothermal synthesis). The composite membranes that were
prepared exhibited a separation performance with a p-xylene/o-xylene separation factor of 5.35 and permeability
of 76 g/m2 h for 95% o-xylene at 25 °C.
The preparation procedure was designed from an economical perspective
to facilitate any possible future commercialization.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Obtaining a pure isomer
is very important in the industrial production
of polyethylene terephthalate, which is used mostly in the production
of plastic bottles.1 The forms of xylene,
that is, o-, m-, and p-xylene, are used as raw materials to produce phthalic anhydride,
isophathalic acid, and terephthalic acid, respectively. Consequently,
all of the isomers of xylene are used to produce plastics and rubber,
and they also are used as additives to gasoline. Obtaining these substances
with high levels of purity will enhance the efficiency of the process,
thereby decreasing the associated costs.2Table 1 shows that
the xylene isomers, that is, p-xylene, m-xylene, and o-xylene, have similar boiling points,
which makes it difficult to separate them by conventional methods.3 In a physical mixture, p-xylene
is expected to permeate through a ZSM-5 membrane because its kinetic
diameter is estimated to be 0.58 nm, while both m-xylene and o-xylene have kinetic diameters of 0.68
nm, which are larger than the 0.6 nm pores of ZSM-5.4 Therefore, this mixture is an excellent candidate for use
in testing hydrophobic membranes, such as ZSM-5 zeolite membranes,
in a pervaporation (PV) system. Because of the hydrophobic property
and pore size of ZSM-5, it has been used extensively in organic separation
processes.4−21 However, the conventional methods used to produce ZSM-5, that is,
in situ and secondary growth procedures, are complex and require a
long period of time because they involve the preparation of the synthesis
gel solution.22−25 In this paper, a straightforward preparation method is used to produce
ZSM-5 membranes for use in separating isomers. The preparation method
was achieved by using a low-cost carbon precursor in the preparation
process to block any defects, which is similar to the preparation
approaches we reported in our previous work to synthesize zeolite
A, mordenite, and clinoptilolite membranes.22 The results reported in this paper indicate that effective membranes
were synthesized. This allows the production of ZSM-5 membranes without
using the hydrothermal synthesis, which is replaced with the direct
use of synthetic or natural zeolites.

2 Results and Discussion
In order to
examine the sustainability of the ZSM-5 structure during
the conditions of the pyrolysis, ready-made zeolite powder was tested
by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (PANalytical, Empyrean XE) before
and after exposure to these conditions. Figure 1 shows that there was a perfect match between
the key peaks of the XRD patterns before and after pyrolysis, which
confirmed the thermal stability of ZSM-5.

Figure 1 Comparison of ZSM-5 before
and after applying pyrolysis condition.

The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), (JEOL, JSM-IT300) images, Figure 2, clearly show the
zeolite crystals with significant quantity are deposited on the surface
but no defined boundaries of the ZSM-5 layer are evident as it was
expected to be internal with the support. Also, an electron-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrometer equipped with an INCA x-act detector was
obtained from Oxford Instrumentation and used for further characterization.
The EDX spectrometer indicated that the major components in the membrane
that had been prepared were carbon, silica, and alumina. Figure 3 shows that there
was good coverage of the stainless-steel support by the zeolite–carbon
with XRD pattern presented in Figure 4, which demonstrate and represent the key peaks of
ZSM-5 that matches the standard sample in Figure 1 (at 2θ = 8, 8.9 and 23). Also, the
carbon curve is presented in the XRD pattern as shown in Figure 4 (from 2θ =
5 to ∼10). It was difficult to measure the thickness of the
membrane, but the mass of carbon–zeolite was determined based
on the weights of the disks before and after synthesis, as shown in Table 2.

To obtain clear and reliable results, p-xylene
and o-xylene were chosen because of the greater difference
in their boiling points (5.5 °C). This facilitated the analysis
of the products using gas chromatography, which was expected to yield
easily distinguished peaks in the pattern of the product. The p-xylene/o-xylene mixture came in contact
with the membrane at different feed concentrations and temperatures.
For comparison purposes, the prepared carbon–zeolite membrane
was tested at four different concentrations, that is, 95, 90, 80,
and 70 wt % o-xylene, and Table 3 provides the results.

The data show a diffusion
preference for p-xylene,
which was attributed to its smaller kinetic diameter than that of o-xylene. In general, these membranes had modest performances
in terms of fluxes and separation factors. The low separation factors
probably were due to the unavoidable pinholes on the surface of the
membrane and due to the long duration of the runs, where the close
sizes of the ZSM-5 pores and the kinetic diameter of p-xylene have a negative role in narrowing the diffusion preferences.
In order to determine the permeation mechanism, other pure feeds with
different kinetic diameters, that is, ethanol (0.43 nm), cyclohexane
(0.6 nm), and phenol (0.66 nm), were evaluated four times at 25 °C
as illustrated in Figure 5. The ZSM-5 pores, with diameters possibly in the range 0.6
± 0.02 nm, very likely were obtained. The permeability trend
was decreasing as the kinetic diameters of the pure compounds were
increasing. The sharp decrease in the permeability of cyclohexane
probably was due to it having a larger kinetic diameter than the ZSM-5
pores (0.6 nm). This was attributed to the size exclusion behavior
(molecular sieving mechanism). Thus, the presence of compounds with
molecules larger than 0.6 nm on the permeate side possibly was due
to the adsorption and affinity of these molecules toward the structure
of ZSM-5. Another potential reason these molecules were present in
the permeate side was the unavoidable cracks and pinholes in the membrane.

of permeability on kinetic diameter for different compounds.

We investigated the effect of sucrose on the separation
factor
and permeability of the membrane. Figure 6 shows the results of the evaluation of the
concentrations of sucrose in water, that is, 50–75% sucrose.
The trends in the Figure 6 indicate that the concentration of the sucrose precursor
solution was related directly to the separation factor and related
inversely to the overall flux. This was attributed to the formation
of more structures26 because the concentration
of the precursor increased as the d-spacing values
decreased gradually from 3.21 to 3.11 (Figure 7). The d-spacing values
of the membranes prepared at different sucrose concentrations were
estimated by Bragg’s formula, that is, d =
λ/2 sin θ.

performance
at 50 °C.

Figure 7 XRD patterns of carbon samples prepared at different
precursor
concentrations.

The temperature effect was evaluated
by using a constant feed composition
of 50 wt %. Figure 8 shows that the temperature was proportional to the permeate flux,
while the separation performance did not show any noticeable change
in that range. The feed temperature had a slight effect on the permeate
fluxes due to the effect of the temperature on fugacity on the liquid
side of the membrane.

and separation
factor at constant feed composition of 50% wt.

After the synthesis of the ZSM-5 carbon composite membranes using
porous, stainless-steel supports, the fabrication process was repeated
several times to evaluate the repeatability of their performances
at 50 °C, as shown in Table 4. The results indicated that the preparation method
resulted in a steady performance, which was estimated using the deviation
data variances (S2) and calculated using eq 1. The membranes had permeate
fluxes and selectivities within variances of 0.41 and 0.013, respectively. 1

Figures 9–11 shows that
the durabilities
of these membranes also were tested and assessed for 100 h. These
figures show a comparison between the xylene fluxes that had been
conducted at two different temperatures, that is, 25 and 50 °C.
In general, the permeation flux of each isomer decreased over time
in the temperature range that was investigated due to the concentration
polarization on the membrane surface. The PV flux increased as the
temperature increased for all of the isomers. Numerous studies have
reported similar temperature dependence of the permeation flux through
Mobil Five (MFI) membranes within this temperature range.1,4,12,14 The selectivity of the membrane prepared in this study were compared
with those presented in the literature as shown in Table 5.

3 Conclusions
In order to avoid the complexity
of preparing ZSM-5 membranes by
the conventional method, that is, hydrothermal synthesis, an easy
and less time-consuming method using an inexpensive carbon precursor
was evaluated for xylene separation at different feed temperatures
in the range of 25–50 °C. The results indicated that the
overall fluxes increased as the temperature increased without affecting
the separation factor. As indicated from this study, the concentration
of the carbon precursor is important in defining the performance of
the membrane, and it was observed that the separation factor of the
membrane was improved slightly by increasing the concentration of
the precursor. This improvement was attributed to formation of dense
structures at the higher concentrations of the precursor as indicated
by the d-spacing. However, there was a noticeable
trade-off between the separation factors and the overall fluxes. Therefore,
the performance of these membranes could be optimized for a given
system by changing the concentration of the precursor that is used.
A noticeable decrease in the PV flux was observed over time, which
was attributed to the polarization of the concentration on the membrane
in the feed flow side. The overall fluxes of the pure xylene isomers
at 25 °C in the first 20 h decreased in the order of p-xylene > m-xylene > o-xylene. The preparation methodology was repeated several times to
ensure the repeatability aspect, and it resulted in a stable performance
with permeate flux and separation factor variances of 0.41 and 0.013,
respectively. The procedure presented in this study for preparing
ZSM-5 flat membranes yielded membranes that provided competitive performances
to those presented in the literature.4,7,8,17,18,21 However, the main objective of
this study was to implement a simple preparation procedure that avoids
the lengthy, conventional preparation methods described in the literature
for the preparation of ZSM-5 membranes.

4 Experimental
Section
Similar to our previous work,22 the
lengthy preparation methods used in in situ and secondary growth methods
were avoided by using the following synthesis method. First, equal
weights of preformed synthetic ZSM-5 (obtained from Eka Nobel) and
deionized water were mixed to form the ZSM-5 paste. Then, 0.4 g of
the ZSM-5 paste was applied on a support disc, and the disc was placed
in a low vacuum system for 5 min. The support metal used in this study
were circular, porous, stainless-steel disks with a diameter of 20
mm, thickness of 1.5 mm, and porosity of 0.5 μm (obtained from
Aegis Advanced Materials Ltd., UK). The porous metal coated with the
ZSM-5 paste was allowed to dry for 1 h. A 50% sucrose solution was
prepared by mixing 2 g of sucrose (obtained from Fisher Scientific
UK, Ltd.) with 2 g of distilled water. A 0.45 g quantity of the sucrose
solution was used to cover the ZSM-5 paste that had been in the low
vacuum system for 5 min, and then, the disc was heated at the rate
of 5 °C/min in a tubular furnace, followed by the pyrolysis process
for 4 h at 550 °C. The carbon–zeolite membrane (ZSM-5)
that was produced was glued onto to a nonporous, stainless-steel washer
using the two-component adhesive epoxy Araldite Rapid (obtained from
Fisher Scientific UK, Ltd.), resulting a membrane surface area of
16 mm in diameter. Subsequently, Teflon rings were used to fit the
membrane between the two compartments of the membrane cell, and the
membrane was clamped. Figure 12 shows the PV system that was used in this study to evaluate
the membranes that were prepared. A pump was used to feed the feed
mixture of p-xylene/o-xylene to
the membrane compartment at the rate of 130 mL/min. Then, the permeation
process occurred due to the driving force caused by the difference
in the partial pressures, where the pressure on the permeate side
was set to 8 Pa. The permeate that was in the vapor phase was collected
by condensing it with cold media, that is, liquid nitrogen traps.
The PV process was conducted with different feed compositions using
a total volume of 200 mL. The performance of each membrane used in
the process described above was estimated in terms of separation factor
(αi,j) (eq 2) and total flux (F) (eq 3) 2   3  where (Wi) and (Wj) are
the weight compositions of the binary components of the mixture; (WP) and (WF) are
the weight compositions of the permeate and feed, respectively; (ms) is the weight of the collected permeate sample;
(A) is the surface area of the activated membrane;
and (Δt) is duration of the experiment.
