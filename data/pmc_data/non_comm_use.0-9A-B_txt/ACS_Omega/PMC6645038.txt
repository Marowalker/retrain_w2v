This paper proposes
a wideband and polarization-insensitive metamaterial
absorber (MA) based on tractable conductive plastic, which is compatible
with an additive manufacturing technology. We provide the design,
fabrication, and measurement result of the proposed absorber and investigate
its absorption principle. The performance characteristics of the structure
are demonstrated numerically and experimentally. The simulation results
indicate that the absorption of this absorber is greater than 90%
in the frequency range of 16.3–54.3 GHz, corresponding to the
relative absorption bandwidth of 108%, where a high absorption rate
is achieved. Most importantly, this additive manufactured structure
provides a new way for the design and fabrication of wideband MAs.

1 Introduction
Metamaterials are artificial
structures which offer extraordinary
interactions with the light not readily seen in the natural materials.
They have attracted intense scientific attentions because of their
unique and peculiar properties. For instance, metamaterials have been
recently used for the realization of the negative refraction materials,1,2 invisible cloaks,3,4 and miniaturization of antennas
and microwave devices.5−7 The metamaterial absorber (MA) was first presented
in 2008 by Landy et al.8 with the advantages
of thin configuration and compact size. Since then, various MAs have
been reported, including dual-band MA,9−12 triple-band MA,13,14 multiband MA,15,16 and wideband MA.17−32

Wideband absorbers with high absorption are extremely demanded
for imaging, sensing, and nondestructive detection. To increase the
absorption bandwidth, one may use a multilayer structure,17−19 which leads to a complicated fabrication procedure as the absorber
thickness is hardly realizable. Recently, it is shown that the absorption
peak may be widened by increasing the resistance of the resonator.20−22 Hence, new materials were adopted to wideband MAs, including the
resistive films such as the indium tin oxide (ITO) film,23−25 tantalum nitride,27,28 and graphene.31,32 However, the fabrication of the aforementioned wideband MA is still
complicated. For instance, one may hardly acquire a perfect monolayer
graphene through chemical vapor deposition.33 Moreover, the fabrication of the tantalum nitride based MA is a
big challenge with the current state-of-the-art technology.

An additive manufacturing technology is a promising processing
technology which provides convenience, high efficiency, and low cost.
However, the biggest obstacle for the fabrication of wideband MAs
using an additive manufacturing technology is the lack of an appropriate
high-resistive film which is tractable and stable. It should be noted
that the graphene, ITO film, and tantalum nitride are not compatible
with the additive manufacturing method.

In our earlier work,
we reported a new type of conductive plastic
with proper machinability, high thermal stability, and high conductivity,
representing an excellent alternative as the high-resistive film of
the MA which is perfectly compatible with the additive manufacturing
technology.34,35 This paper introduces a wideband
MA based on the conductive plastic with additive manufacturing method.
To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first demonstration
of a wideband MA which employs an additive manufacturing technology.
The proposed structure exhibits several advantages in comparison with
the previously reported wideband MAs. First, we use an additive manufacturing
technology which makes the fabrication of the proposed MA simpler,
effective, and low cost. Second, thanks to the high conductivity of
the conductive plastic, the absorption bandwidth of the MA may be
significantly increased. The proposed structure provides new opportunities
for the design and fabrication of wideband MAs.

2 Absorber
Configuration
Figure 1 illustrates
a schematic of the proposed wideband MA. It consists of a patterned
conductive plastic layer embedded in a polylactic acid (PLA) layer,
while the bottom of the PLA layer is covered by a copper ground film. Figure 2a,b depicts the unit
cell structure, where the optimal geometrical parameters are found
as h1 = 1.3 mm, h2 = 1.3 mm, d = 0.1 mm, t = 0.017 mm, a = 8 mm, and r =
3.7 mm. The relative permittivity of the PLA substrate is 2.4 + i0.01,
and the measured surface resistance of the conductive plastic is 100
Ω/□.

Figure 1 Architecture of the wideband MA.

Figure 2 Unit cell of the MA in Figure 1: (a) perspective, (b) layout.

We next verify the operation of the MA by the numerical simulation
of the structure using the finite difference time domain method. We
use the unit cell boundary conditions for x and y directions. We achieve the absorption spectra under a
transverse magnetic (TM)-polarized normal incident wave, where the
electric field vector is parallel to the y axis.

The absorption ratio of the MA, A, may be determined
as A = 1 – |S11|2 – |S21|2, where S11 and S21 denote the reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively.
As the transmission coefficient S21 is
zero because of the existence of the copper ground film, the absorption
ratio A may be calculated by A =
1 – |S11|2.

Figure 3 shows the
achieved absorption spectrum of the proposed MA. It is observed that
from 16.3 to 54.3 GHz, covering the whole K-band and Kα-band,
the absorption ratio is greater than 90%. Moreover, the corresponding
relative absorption bandwidth WRAB, that
is, WRAB = 2(fU – fL)/(fU + fL), where fU and fL are the upper and
lower frequencies with the absorption ratio above 90%, can reach to
108%.

TM-polarized wave.

Table 1 compares
the performance characteristics of the proposed MA with those of the
recently reported wideband MAs. It may be seen from Table 1 that the proposed absorber
possesses a relatively thin thickness and a wideband absorption with
high absorptivity. In addition, our design offers the polarization
insensitivity. Besides the absorption performance of the proposed
structure, as stated above, it is the sole one which is compatible
with the additive manufacturing technology.

3 Absorption Mechanism
In order to best
show the intrinsic mechanism of the proposed MA, Figure 4 presents the simulation
results for the surface current distributions in the conductive plastic
pattern and copper ground layer at two peak resonant frequencies,
that is, 26.8 and 40.5 GHz. For the first mode, as shown in Figure 4a, the surface current
on the conductive plastic layer mainly flows parallel to the direction
of the electric field vector of the incident wave. Compared with the
surface current distributions in the conductive plastic layer, the
current density on the copper ground layer (Figure 4b) is much smaller. This result indicates
that the magnetic resonance is weak because of the lack of the antiparallel
currents. For the second mode, as shown in Figure 4c, there are two main surface current flows
on the conductive plastic layer which excites a high-order electric
resonance. Moreover, the magnetic resonance of the second mode is
negligible which is due to the absence of the antiparallel current
flows on the ground plane. As a result, the electric excitation occurs
on the conductive plastic film which is responsible for the high absorption
across a wide frequency range.

Figure 4 Simulation results for the surface current
distribution. (a) In
the conductive plastic layer at 26.8 GHz. (b) In the copper ground
layer at 26.8 GHz. (c) In the conductive plastic layer at 40.5 GHz.
(d) In the copper ground layer at 40.5 GHz.

Figure 5a–f
illustrates the numerical simulation results for the surface loss
in the conductive plastic layer and the copper ground layer and the
power loss density in the PLA layer for the two resonant modes. As
shown in Figure 5a,d,
the conductive plastic layer contributes most power absorption of
the absorber for both resonant modes, that is, 97.4% for the first
mode and 96.8% for the second mode, respectively. Hence, the conductive
plastic layer plays an important role in the wideband absorption.

simulation results for two resonant modes. (a,d) Distribution

of the surface losses in the copper ground layer, and (c,f) distributions
of the dielectric power loss density in the PLA layer.

The retrieved input impedance equation of an MA
may be expressed
as 1  

To achieve
the input matching of the MA, Z should
be chosen to match with the impedance of free space of Z = 1. Figure 6 shows
the normalized input impedance of the designed absorber. It may be
observed from Figure 6 that the normalized impedance of the absorption resonance frequencies
are 0.992 + 0.139i and 1.005 + 0.029i and approximately match with
the free-space impedance. Meanwhile, the real parts of the impedance
are close to unity, and the imaginary parts are close to zero at the
frequency range from 16.3 to 54.3 GHz, providing a wideband absorption
with a high absorption ratio.

Figure 6 Normalized input impedance of the proposed MA.

To best understand the absorption
mechanism of the absorber, Figure 7 plots the absorption
spectra for different loss conditions of the PLA substrate, different
dielectric constants of the PLA substrate, and different surface resistances
of the conductive plastic. As shown in Figure 7a, the loss condition of the PLA substrate
slightly affects the absorption spectra. This implies that the PLA
substrate contributes a very small portion of the total energy consumption.
Moreover, Figure 7b
shows the influence of the dielectric constant of the substrate. It
can be seen that with the increase of dielectric constant, the absorption
rate at an upper frequency decreases rapidly. As a result, the absorption
bandwidth decreases with the increase of the dielectric constant of
the substrate. In addition, as shown in Figure 7c, with the increase of the surface resistance
of the conductive plastic, the absorption ratio will significantly
enhance. This is due to the fact that the concentration of the surface
currents on the conductive plastic pattern may cause strong ohmic
loss, that is, Ploss = I2R, in which R is the
resistance of the resistive film. However, the continuous increase
of the surface resistance leads to the decrease of the absorption
bandwidth. Hence, the surface resistance of the conductive plastic
of 100 Ω/□ appears to be optimal for the proposed structure.

resistances of the conductive plastic.

4 Absorption Dependence on the Polarization and
Oblique Incidence
This section describes the performance
dependence of the MA on
the polarization and incident angles. Because the polarization insensitivity
property is very crucial for a wideband MA, we first analyze the electromagnetic
responses of the absorber for different polarization angles. Because
the resonant structure is symmetric, the proposed absorber may be
studied only for polarization angles up to 45°. Figure 8 plots the absorption spectra
for different wave polarizations. It may be observed from Figure 8 that the absorption
spectra are constant under different polarization angles, as the structure
is independent of the wave polarization.

Figure 8 Absorption spectra for
different wave polarizations.

Now, let us focus on the effect of the angle of incidence
on the
absorption. Figure 9a plots the results of the effect of angle of incidence θ on
the absorption for the TM polarization. It is observed that for the
angle of incident θ of below 45°, the frequency bandwidth
with the absorption ratio of greater than 0.9 remains above 38 GHz.
Moreover, with the increase of the angle of incidence, the absorptivity
even increases at high-frequency regions. Hence, the proposed absorber
exhibits an outstanding wideband absorption performance under TM polarization
in the case of oblique incidence. Figure 9b plots the same result for the transverse
electric (TE) polarization. In a similar approach, the absorption
bandwidth with a high absorption ratio remains nearly the same for
the angle of incidence θ below 45°. However, further increasing
the θ yields decreases the absorption in low-frequency regions.
In general, the proposed structure operates in a wide range of angle
of incidence for both TM and TE polarizations.

the effect of angle of incidence on the
absorption for (a) TM and (b) TE polarizations.

5 Fabrication and Measurement
The MA is fabricated
using the additive manufacturing method. We
use a SinoTec ST 200 FDM three-dimensional (3D) printer with a print
accuracy of 0.05 mm to print the proposed absorber. Figure 10a shows the process of a complete
absorber sample. First, a PLA layer with grooves is 3D printed. Next,
the patterned conductive plastics were placed in these grooves, and
then the PLA is continually printed above the patterned plastics to
seal them. Finally, copper is pasted on the bottom surface of the
PLA layer. Figure 10b shows an image of the fabricated sample with an array of 10 ×10
unit cells.

Figure 10 Photographs of the fabricated process: (a) PLA material
layer is
3D printed; (b) photograph of the fabricated sample. Photograph courtesy

The experiment is carried out in free space. Figure 11 shows an image of the experimental
setup, where two horn antennas, one for the K-band and the another
for the Ka-band, are connected to a Rohde & Schwarz ZVA 40 vector
network analyzer to measure the performance characteristics of the
sample in the frequency range 18–40 GHz. Figure 12a plots the actual reflection
from the sample by comparison of the reflection from the absorber
and the reflection from the identical copper plate. Figure 12b shows the measured absorptivity
plot, where a wideband absorption is achieved with the absorptivity
greater than 90% from 23.3 GHz, covering the whole Ka-band. Because
of the upper frequency limitation of the Rohde & Schwarz ZVA 40
vector network analyzer, the measurement is limited to 40 GHz. Moreover,
from Figure 12b, the
measured results are in agreement with the simulations except for
the lower-frequency region of the K-band, which may be attributed
to fabrication tolerance.

6 Conclusions
We presented a simple and high-performance
wideband MA based on
the conductive plastic. In contrast to the previously reported wideband
MAs, we introduced an additive manufacturing technology to the sample
fabrication, which is simple, effective, and low cost. We next demonstrated
the absorption mechanism and efficiency by numerical simulations of
the absorber. The absorber demonstrates a wideband absorption with
an absorption ratio of above 0.9 from 16.3 to 54.3 GHz, corresponding
to a relative absorption bandwidth of 108%. Moreover, the design strategy
makes the structure insensitive to the wave polarization, as well
as the oblique incidences for both TE and TM polarizations. The proposed
design is verified by free-space experiments, where a good agreement
between the simulated and measured results is achieved across a wide
frequency band. This study is expected to reveal the potential applications
of additive manufacturing technology in the realization of wideband
electromagnetic wave absorbers.
