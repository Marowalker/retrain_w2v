The
simpler the design, the better and more effective it is. Two
novel conjugated triarylamine derivatives in donor−π–donor
structure employing biphenyl core and pyrene core as π-bridges,
which are termed as Bp-OMe and Py-OMe, have been synthesized and characterized
and then applied to perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as hole-transport
materials (HTMs) successfully. Using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobiuorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) as a relative reference, Py-OMe-based PSCs showed the
best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.28% under AM 1.5 G illumination
at 100 mW cm–2, which is comparable to that of PSCs
based on spiro-OMeTAD with a best PCE of 18.57% with doping. Although
Bp-OMe-based PSCs performed with relatively poor PCEs (best PCE of
15.06%) than those of Py-OMe-based PSCs, attributing to the poor planarity
and hole mobility, taking the cost into consideration, Bp-OMe and
Py-OMe are much more likely to be promising efficient HTMs for PSCs.

Introduction
When power conversion
efficiencies (PCEs) in photovoltaic industry
oriented by crystal silicon solar cells almost reached their peaks,1,2 the roaring across the horizon of organic–inorganic hybrid
perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at the dawn of the 21th century gave
the scientific and energy community a great surprise. Excellent photovoltaic
properties, such as a large absorption scope, narrow band gap, high
carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion, and high stability of the
perovskite (PVSK) light-absorber in PSCs makes it the most striking
material of the new generation in photovoltaics, and the skyrocketing
PCEs, simplification of device architectures, and cost reduction of
PSCs give infinite and positive possibilities.3,4

It has been certified by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
recently that the PCEs of PSCs have reached to over 22% from the initial
3.8% by engineering of charge extracting layers and device architectures,
as well as decrease in defects and hysteresis.5 It is good to be reminded that introducing hole-transport materials
(HTMs) to PSC devices led to a noteworthy improvement in PCEs.6,7 Besides extracting holes from PVSK to metal electrodes, HTMs also
prevent the backflow of electrons from PVSK to metal electrodes and
determine the open voltage circuit (VOC) of PSCs.8 Owing to their excellent performance,
organic small molecules 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobiuorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) and macromolecule poly[-bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine]
become the most successful and popularly employed HTMs in PSC devices.9,10 However, their disadvantages such as long synthetic route and high
cost are negative to PSCs’ commercialization.11,12 Therefore, developing low-cost and efficient HTMs is still an urgent
task. Recently, some organic small molecules that are typically linear,13 star-shaped,14,15 and butterfly-shaped16 donor−π–donor conjugated
were introduced into PSCs as HTMs. Using molecules such as spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene],17 thiophene,18 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,19 carbazole,20 naphtho-dithiophene,21,22 and triazatruxene23 as π-bridges
and diphenylamine, triphenylamine, or diarylamine-substituted carbazole
as electron donors, these HTMs showed excellent photoelectric function
performance in PSCs.

In this work, as shown in Scheme 1, two new triarylamine derivatives
named as Bp-OMe
and Py-OMe, respectively, employing biphenyl core and pyrene core
as π-bridges were synthesized and characterized and then applied
to PSCs as HTMs. For photoelectric conversion, using spiro-OMeTAD
as an objective and relative reference, doping with lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide
salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), Py-OMe-based
PSCs showed the best PCE of 19.23% (under AM 1.5 G illumination at
100 mW cm–2), which is higher than that of PSCs
based on spiro-OMeTAD with the best PCE of 18.57%. Although Bp-OMe-based
PSCs performed with relatively poor PCEs (a best PCE of 15.06%) than
those of Py-OMe-based PSCs, attributing to the poor planarity and
hole mobility, taking the cost into consideration, Bp-OMe and Py-OMe
are much more likely promising efficient HTMs for PSCs for they can
be obtained by a one-step Suzuki–Miyaura C–C cross-coupling24 with high yields and sample purification. The
estimated costs of Bp-OMe and Py-OMe are $62.7 and $50.1 g–1, respectively, much cheaper than that of our purchased spiro-OMeTAD
(≈$176.5 g–1),12,25 making them
very possible as prevailing commercial HTMs for PSCs. For PVSK absorber
layer, replacing methylammonium (MA) with the larger formamidinium
(FA) cation can further lower its band gap and extend light absorption
to the infrared region.26−28 On the other hand, doping moderate
bromide to the absolute iodine PVSK enhances the charge carrier lifetime.
As has been reported, a combination of two PVSK materials with the
nominal formula (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 may create a higher PCE,28,29 so we used this kind of PVSK in the present paper.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
Biphenyl-triphenylamine and pyrene-triphenylamine
derivatives (Bp-OMe and Py-OMe), which can be purified via simple
recrystallization, were synthesized by one-step straightforward Suzuki–Miyaura
cross-coupling under a N2 atmosphere in excellent overall
yields (85% for Bp-OMe and 89% for Py-OMe), starting from commercial
4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline, brominated biphenyl,
and brominated pyrene. The chemical structures of Bp-OMe and Py-OMe
were confirmed by 1H/13C (400 MHz) NMR and high-resolution
mass spectroscopy. The detailed synthesis, characterization, and cost
estimation method of two new HTMs is shown in the Supporting Information.

Thermomechanical Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) measurements were carried out to determine thermal properties
of Bp-OMe and Py-OMe (Figure 1). It was found that Bp-OMe and Py-OMe show good thermal stability
up to 431 °C, indicating that the change of π-linker does
not influence thermal stability.

Py-OMe at (scan rate:

Energy Levels of HTMs Matching with Those of Perovskite
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) determined the highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of these organic molecule
films.30,31 According to the UPS data in Figure 2a, HOMO energy levels of spiro-OMeTAD,
Bp-OMe, and Py-OMe were calculated to be −5.10, −5.30,
and −5.40 eV with respect to the vacuum level (Figure 2c), respectively. HOMO energy
levels of Bp-OMe and Py-OM are located between the valence band of
(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 (−5.50 eV) and Au electrode (−5.10 eV), indicating
that they are appropriate to extract the hole from PVSK absorber layer
to Au electrodes. In addition, films of spiro-OMeTAD, Bp-OMe, and
Py-OMe express their initial absorption band edges (λonset) at 416, 400, and 454 nm and maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 384, 342, and 426 nm, respectively (Figure 2c). Absorption regions of three
HTMs appearing between 300 and 500 nm are assigned to the π–π*
transitions resulting from their conjugated system.32−34 From the band
gap formula Eg = 1240/λonset,35,36 the corresponding band gaps (Eg) for spiro-OMeTAD, Bp-OMe, and Py-OMe are 2.98, 3.10,
and 2.73 eV, respectively. Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energy levels were calculated from the formula LUMO = HOMO – Eg(37) and values of
LUMO energy levels of spiro-OMeTAD, Bp-OMe, and Py-OMe films were
−2.12, −2.20, and −2.67 eV, respectively, meeting
the requirements of preventing electron backflow from PVSK to metal
electrodes. UPS and absorption results above are summarized in Table 1, and energy level
diagram of indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au devices
is shown in Figure 2c. As the HOMO energy level of Py-OMe film is lower than that of
Bp-OMe, we can expect a higher VOC of
Py-OMe-based PSC.

Conversion
To evaluate the properties
of two new HTMs, n–i–p type planar PSC devices based
on spiro-OMeTAD, Bp-OMe, and Py-OMe doping with Li-TFSI and TBP were
fabricated with a stack of ITO/SnO2/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/HTM/Au and here the
device based on spiro-OMeTAD can be a good reference. Generally, in
our devices, the thickness for SnO2, PVSK, HTM, and Au
is 30, 600, 150, and 100 nm, respectively. For voltage scans from
−1.2 to −0.2 V, current density–voltage (J–V) curves of three kinds of PSCs
are shown in Figure 3a. Under the same conditions (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm–2), Py-OMe-based PSCs showed their best PCE at 19.28%, with a VOC of 1.11 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of 22.82 mA cm–2, and
fill factor (FF) of 76.1% when devices based on spiro-OMeTAD performed
at the best PCE of 18.57% and devices based on Bp-OMe performed at
the best PCE at 15.06%, with a VOC of
0.98 V, short-circuit current (JSC) of
21.93 mA cm–2, and FF of 70.0%. The lower HOMO energy
level of Py-OMe contributes to the higher VOC of PSCs based on Py-OMe, whereas JSC and FF are consistent with HTMs’ hole mobility and conductivity.38,39J–V curves of devices based
on Bp-OMe, Py-OMe, and spiro-OMeTAD (Figure S1), which were scanned in two directions (100 mV s–1), were compared to study the hysteresis. There is only a hysteresis
of 0.43 for the device’s PCE based on Py-OMe, whereas the hysteresis
of the devices with Bp-OMe and spiro-OMe are 1.57 and 1.04, respectively.

conditions (30 devices were tested). (c) Stabilized PCEs of solar
cells. (d) Devices’ PCE variations in 50 days without package

Thirty uniform PSC devices based on each HTM were measured
to appraise
Gaussian distributions and average values of corresponding photovoltaic
parameters (Figure 3b and Table 2). The
average PCE values are 13.29, 17.29, and 16.86% for PSCs based on
Bp-OMe, Py-OMe, and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Furthermore, holding
the voltage at the maximum power point, PCEs of 14.97, 19.13, and
18.24% corresponding to devices with Bp-OMe, Py-OMe, and spiro-OMeTAD
all show good stability (Figure 3c). For long-term stability in a natural environment,
the PCE of devices based on three HTMs can all maintain over 90% within
15 days and decrease to 65–70% in the 55th day and devices
based on Py-OMe performed slightly more stable than Bp-OMe and spiro-OMeTAD-based
PSCs (Figure 3d).

Hole Mobility Analysis
Prior to
PSC fabrication, the
hole-transport ability of HPB-OMe and HTB-OMe was measured by space-charge-limited
current technique (Figure 4a) with the device structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/Au and calculated by the Mott–Gurney
law,40 which is fitted by the J–V curves, investigated from the formula  where J is the
current density,
μ is the hole mobility, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity
(8.85 × 10–12 F m–1), ε
is the relative permittivity of the material (approaching 3 for organic
semiconductors), V is the applied voltage, and d is the thickness of the active layer. For Bp-OMe, Py-OMe,
and spiro-OMeTAD, the thicknesses are 180, 170, and 190 nm, respectively,
which are measured by the step profiler. The hole mobility values
of different HTMs are summarized in Table 2. Py-OMe film exhibits a hole mobility of
4.443 × 10–3 cm2 V–1 s–1, which is over 3.6 times that of Bp-OMe, which
can be attributed to its intrinsic structure for the pyrene core that
leads to a better layer-by-layer stacking.41

hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au devices. (b) Incident photon-to-current
efficiency (IPCE) spectra for corresponding devices. (c) Time-resolved
photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra for the pristine PVSK film and PVSK/HTM
bilayer, with excitation at 445 nm and monitoring at 765 nm. (d) Photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of corresponding devices, with excitation at 600 nm.

Photoluminescence (PL)
and Time-resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL)
Incident photon-to-current
efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PSCs based
on three HTMs are shown in Figure 4b. Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices reached a maximum of
91% external quantum efficiency (EQE), and Bp-OMe and Py-OMe-based
devices exceeded 80% EQE from 380 to 760 nm spectral scope, which
is slightly weaker than that of spiro-OMeTAD-based devices. The resultant
IPCE values are in good agreement with JSC in the J–V curves and for
spiro-OMeTAD, Bp-OMe, and Py-OMe are 22.63, 21.70, and 22.01 mA cm–2, respectively.

Time-resolved transient photoluminescence
(TRPL) and continuous wave photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded
to compare the carrier transfer and recombination in three kinds of
PSCs.42,43 The radiative lifetimes of the pristine
PVSK, PVSK/spiro-OMeTAD, PVSK/Bp-OMe, and PVSK/Py-OMe are about 60.3,
16.2, 28.5, and 18.7 ns, respectively. The shorter decay time of the
Py-OMe-based device than that of Bp-OMe-based device demonstrates
Py-OMe’s more effective hole extraction ability and less charge
recombination in PSC devices. As shown in Figure 4d, the PL peak intensity of PVSK/Py-OMe is
smaller than that of PVSK/Bp-OMe. It is consistent with the TRPL measurement
that Py-OMe has stronger ability to extract, which can result in a
better PCE.

Conclusions
In summary, we synthesized
two novel conjugated triarylamine derivatives
employing biphenyl core and pyrene core as π-bridges, which
are termed as Bp-OMe and Py-OMe, and then applied to PSCs as HTMs.
Best PCEs of 15.06, 18.57, and 19.28% under AM 1.5 G illumination
at 100 mW cm–2 were measured for the devices with
Bp-OMe, Py-OMe, and spiro-OMeTAD as HTMs with doping, respectively.
Although Bp-OMe-based PSCs performed with relatively poor PCEs than
those of Py-OMe-based PSCs, attributing to the poor planarity and
hole mobility, taking the cost into consideration, Bp-OMe and Py-OMe
are all likely to be promising efficient HTMs for PSCs.

General Methods
Chemicals and reagents were purchased
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification if
not specially mentioned. Air-sensitive reactions were carried out
under a nitrogen atmosphere. The device preparation was done in air
atmosphere. NMR spectra were recorded in designated deuterated solvent
on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz spectrometer at 298 K. Coupling constant

Preparation of Perovskite Films and Device Fabrication
The
conductive glass substrates (ITO-coated glass) were cleaned by
ultrasonication in isopropanol (30 min), suds (30 min), deionized
water (30 min), acetone (15 min), and isopropanol (30 min), respectively.
Then, the cleaned ITO was dried under a flux of nitrogen and further
cleaned in the UV-O3 cleaner for 30 min. The precursor
solution of the electron transport layer (SnO2) was spin-coated
onto ITO at 3000 rpm for 30 s, then annealed at 150 °C for 30
min. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving
1.32 M PbI2, 0.12 M PbBr2, 1.08 M FAI, 0.24
M MAI, and 0.12 M MABr in dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide mixed
solvent (v/v = 4:1). To fabricate the perovskite films, the precursor
solution was spin-coated onto the SnO2-coated ITO at 4000
rpm for 25 s in air atmosphere and 2 mL of diethyl ether was dripped
on the rotating substrate in 2 s before the surface changed to turbid.
Then, the prepared perovskite film was annealed at 65 °C for
1 min and 100 °C for 2 min. Optimized concentrations in 1 mL
of chlorobenzene were found to be 65 mM for spiro-OMeTAD and 20 mM
for Bp-OMe and Py-OMe, respectively. Thirty microliters of 4-tert-butylpyridine (>96.0%, TCI), and 35 μL of
lithium
bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich)
solution (260 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich)
were added as additives. Then, the HTM solution was spin-coated onto
the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Due to the low solubility
of Bp-OMe, the HTM solution as well as the substrate were heated to
100 °C for spin-coating. Finally, 100 nm of gold as the metal
electrode on the HTM-coated films was evaporated in a metallization
chamber.

The hole-only devices were fabricated by spin-coating
PEDOT:PSS (1–3% in water) onto precleaned, patterned ITO substrates.
A film of the HTM was spin-coated on top from its chlorobenzene solution
with a concentration same as that for perovskite device fabrication.
As a counter electrode, Au of 100 nm thickness was deposited on top
by vacuum evaporation. The current density–voltage curves of
the devices were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source.

Film and Device
Characterization
The current density–voltage
(J–V) curves were measured
using a solar simulator manufactured by Enli Technology Co., Ltd.
with a source meter (Keithley 2400) at 100 mA cm–2 illumination (AM 1.5 G). The light intensity was adjusted with an
NREL-calibrated silicon solar cell. The active area (0.12 cm2) was defined with a mask with aperture. Transient-state photoluminescence
(PL) was measured by FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with an excitation
at 600 nm. All measurements of solar cells were conducted at room
temperature under ambient atmosphere without encapsulation.
