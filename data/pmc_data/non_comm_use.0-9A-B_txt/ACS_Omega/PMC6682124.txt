We systematically investigated the
influence of polymer coating
on temporal resolution of solid-state nanopores. We fabricated a Si3N4 nanopore integrated with a polyimide sheet partially
covering the substrate surface. Upon detecting the nanoparticles dispersed
in an electrolyte buffer by ionic current measurements, we observed
a larger resistive pulse height along with a faster current decay
at the tails under larger coverage of the polymeric layer, thereby
suggesting a prominent role of the water-touching Si3N4 thin film as a significant capacitor serving to retard the
ionic current response to the ion blockade by fast translocation of
particles through the nanopores. From this, we came up with back-side
polymer-coated chip designs and demonstrated improved pore sensor
temporal resolution by developing a nanopore with a thick polymethyl-methacrylate
layer laminated on the bottom surface. The present findings may be
useful in developing integrated solid-state nanopore sensors with
embedded nanochannels and nanoelectrodes.

Introduction
Solid-state nanopores
have been used as a useful sensor platform
for detecting individual nanoscopic objects1−5 and studying their fast translocation in a confined
nanofluidic system.6−10 This monitors ion transport through a nanoscale conduit sculpted
in a thin membrane using a pair of electrodes in an electrolyte buffer.
When a particle passes through the nanochannel, the ion flow is obstructed
which is seen as a temporal drop of the ionic current. The thus obtained
resistive current pulses were found to contain rich information concerning
the size,11,12 shape,13,14 surface charges,15,16 and even surface chemical and biological components of analytes
when the pore is surface-functionalized to add bio- and chemo-selectivity,17−22 that enables the identification of miscellaneous bio-samples from
cells to nucleotides by resistive pulse waveforms.

In this nanosensor,
temporal resolution is a fundamental yet crucial
factor for implementing the single-particle analysis wherein the ionic
current needs to respond rapidly enough to the actual ion blockade
events so as to reflect physical properties of analytes in the associated
resistive pulses.23 Otherwise, fine features
would be smeared leading to critical difficulty in identifying objects
or on the worse side, weaken the signals down to undetectable levels.
This would be in fact a vital issue particularly in small nanopores
for detecting nanometer-sized molecules such as proteins and nucleotides
because despite the expected short translocation time, it calls for
infinitesimal channels in an ultrathin membrane to render enough spatial
resolution that inevitably brings huge capacitance and resistance,
and hence a long charging time.24

Polymer coating has been recently reported as a promising strategy
for improving the temporal resolution.25−27 By covering the nanopore
substrate with a thick organic dielectric layer, the ionic current
tended to respond faster presumably because of the decrease in the
net cross-membrane capacitance. However, it still requires further
studies to elucidate how a polymer layer contributes to the current
response speed. In the present work, therefore, we performed systematic
experiments to explore the roles of the polymeric cover so as to clarify
where and what materials should be added to engineer the impedance
sensor performance.

Results and Discussion
A nanopore
configuration employed to evaluate the role of polymer
coating is shown in Figure 1 (see also Figure S1 for the fabrication
process). This is constructed with a 300 nm-sized nanopore in a 50
nm-thick Si3N4 membrane partially covered with
a 5 μm-thick polyimide layer (Figure 1a–c). On the membrane, phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 200 nm-sized polystyrene beads at a concentration
of 109 particles/mL was added through a fluidic channel
in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) block (Figure S2). Here, the area of water touching the Si3N4 surface was defined by the length Lpoly of the polymeric sheet (Figure 1b). From equivalent circuit model points
of view (Figure 1d),
the cross-plane net capacitance Cnet would
be determined using the polyimide-coated Si3N4 structure as it is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the
other serial components such as the doped Si substrate and the electric
double layer CEDL.24Cnet can then be approximated
as Cnet = (Cpoly + CSi3N4). Here, Cpoly is described as εpolyεvwthinLpoly/tpoly when Lpoly ≤ 12 mm where εv = 8.9 × 10–12 F/m and εpoly = 3.4 are the vacuum permittivity
and the relative permittivity of the polyimide, respectively, wthin = 0.5 mm is the PDMS channel width, and tpoly = 5 μm is the thickness of the polyimide
sheet. Meanwhile, it becomes (0.012εpolyεvwthin/tpoly + (Lpoly – 0.012)εpolyεvwsq/tpoly) in case when Lpoly = 16 mm because of the contribution at the square regions of the
width wsq = 2 mm. Similarly, CSi3N4 at the non-coated 50 nm-thick
Si3N4 domain is calculated as εSi3N4εvwthin(0.012 – Lpoly)/tSi3N4 and εSi3N4εvwthin(Lpoly – 0.012)/tSi3N4 when Lpoly ≤ 12 mm and Lpoly > 12 mm, respectively, with εSi3N4 = 7.5 of the Si3N4 relative permittivity
and tSi3N4 = 50
nm of the thickness of the silicon nitride layer. Because tpoly ≫ tSi3N4, Cnet decreases
steadily with Lpoly. In this way, the
net cross-membrane capacitance is expected to be controlled by the
polyimide length. As for the pore resistance Rpore, on the other hand, we designed the polyimide layer to
have a 50 μm-sized micropore around the nanopore so as to make
its influence on Rpore to be negligibly
small.

The inset image represents the PBS-exposed (skyblue) and -non-exposed
(orange) Si3N4 surface area.

We prepared polyimide-coated nanopore chips of
various Lpore from 0 mm (non-coated) up
to 16 mm and
performed resistive pulse detections of 200 nm-sized carboxylated
polystyrene nanobeads in 0.4× PBS at 0.1 V. Irrespective of Lpore, the open pore ionic current Iion was around 14 nA (Figure S3), which agrees with an analytical expression28−30 of the ionic
resistance Rpore ≈ ρ/dpore with the solution resistivity ρ =
1.4 Ω m for the diluted buffer and dpore = 200 nm. This is not surprising, as the polymer sheets were designed
to cause no notable influence on Iion by
virtue of the micropore configuration at the Si3N4 nanopore. When the buffer contains the polymeric nanobeads, we observed
stochastic temporal drops of the ionic current suggestive of successive
nanoparticle translocation through the nanopore (Figure 2a,b). These resistive pulses
show relatively wide variation in the line shapes at the onset that
reflects the random nature of the particle capture approaching toward
the orifice at variable angles, which is a characteristic feature
in the nanopore having a relatively low thickness-to-diameter aspect
ratio structure (Figures 2c and S4).31,32 In contrast, the tails are less scattered indicating the regular
motions of the escaping particles by virtue of the physical confinement
in the nanochannel.27

and resistive pulses. (a) The cross-pore ionic
current Iion through a polyimide-coated
300 nm-sized Si3N4 nanopore recorded at 0.1
V in 0.4× PBS containing 200 nm-sized carboxylated polystyrene
nanoparticles. The polymer layer had lengths Lpoly of 0 mm (gray), 1 mm (red), 2 mm (blue), 3 mm (green),
6 mm (skyblue), 12 mm (purple), and 16 mm (orange). (b) Close view
of a resistive pulse signifying translocation of a single nanoparticle
through the nanopore. (c) Trajectory-dependent ionic current traces.
30 pulses were overplotted. The onset line-shapes vary widely due
to the variable incident angle of the particles approaching the nanopore.
In contrast, the tails demonstrate little variation reflecting the
regulated motions of the particles in the post-translocation stage.

Here, as shown in Figure 2a, it is noticeable that there
is a marked difference in the
height of the resistive pulses as a whole depending on the dimension
of the polyimide layers: longer Lpoly tends
to provide larger signals. As we already confirmed above that the
polyimide layer contributes little to the cross-pore ion conductance,
the distinct Lpoly dependence of the pulse
height is naturally ascribed to capacitance effects. When this is
the case, it anticipates the charging-derived slow response of the
ionic current compared to the temporal blockage of the ion transport
by fast electrophoresis of the polymeric nanoparticles through the
nanopore.23,27 As a result, the Iion spike-like signals would be blunted to small pulses yet
with an equivalent area.22 Indeed, despite
the large difference in the height (Figure S5), the pulse area was found to be the same in the entire Lpoly-range tested, thereby signifying the prominent
role of the polyimide to change the net capacitance of the nanopore
chip.

The equivalent circuit (Figure 1d) predicts that the capacitance contribution
tends
to retard the current response as Iion = I0 exp(−t/τdelay) where the charging time of capacitor elements enters
through τdelay as τdelay = CnetRpore with the
net cross-membrane capacitance Cnet. To
investigate the capacitive contributions in the polymer-coated nanopores,
we deduced τdelay by exponential fitting to the tails
of the average resistive pulses (Figure 3a). The result revealed an overall tendency
of steady decrease in τdelay with increasing the
size of the polymer sheet (Figure 3b, see also Figures S6 and S7 for the capacitance of each component). This is in qualitative accordance
with the aforementioned reduction in Cnet with Lpoly (Fig. S7), though quantitatively the theoretical CnetRpore is much longer than
τdelay.

of the ionic current
through a nanopore. (a) Close views of resistive pulse tails obtained
for 200 nm-sized polystyrene nanobeads with 300 nm diameter Si3N4 nanopores coated with polyimide layers of different
lengths Lpoly. The red line denotes an
exponential fitting to the polymer-coated nanopore with Lpoly = 3 mm. (b) Lpoly-dependent
temporal resolution of the nanopore sensor.

It should also be noted that the current noise is strongly
suppressed
with Lpoly ≥ 12 mm (Figure 2a, see also Figure S8 for the rms noise data). This can be interpreted
as another outcome of the lowered capacitance by the polymer coating.33,34 Specifically, it was reported that the ionic current noise tends
to be dominated by that stemming from coupling between the amplifier
voltage noise and the nanopore chip capacitance at high frequencies.35,36 Similarly, it is likely that the decrease in the noise level by
the polymer coating is due to diminished capacitance-derived current
fluctuations. As for why the noise does not simply become weaker with Lpoly from 0 to 6 mm is attributable to the counteracting
effects of the lowered capacitance providing not only suppression
of the high-frequency noise but also a faster response of Iion that in turn means less damping of the fast
current fluctuations.

The above findings imply that the capacitance
relevant to the response
speed of Iion can be tailored by only
one-side substrate coating. Thus, a polymer layer may not necessarily
cover a membrane surface to improve the sensor temporal resolution
but it would be equivalently functional when covering the opposite
side of the nanopore chip. Furthermore, the choice of material should
be rather unimportant as long as the thickness can be made thick.
To verify this assertion, we prepared a nanopore substrate (dpore = 200 nm) with the back-side surface being
coated with a 5 μm-thick polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) layer
(Figure 4a). PMMA was
employed to verify whether the coating effect is material dependent.
In this back-coating design, the capacitance CPMMA at the PMMA layer is anticipated to determine Cnet as CPMMA (44
pF) ≪ CSi3N4 (13 nF) ≪ CdSi where CdSi is a huge capacitance at the doped-Si substrate
(Figure 4b). As a comparison,
we also tested a polyimide-coated nanopore with the polymer layer
covering the entire area of the membrane-side surface. Interestingly,
these two designs led to further suppression of the noise from that
in the partially coated nanopore chips suggesting even lower capacitance
achieved by insertion of the large polymer sheet (Figure 4c). More importantly, they
offered an equally well-diminished Iion noise platform thereby inferring the expected role of the back cover
in decreasing the capacitance.

the sensor temporal resolution.

Ionic current curves obtained with front-side polyimide coated (Lpoly = 16 mm, orange) and back-side PMMA coated

with a polyimide layer covering the entire front surface (except the
50 μm region around the nanopore) was also shown (dark yellow).
(d) Magnified views of resistive pulse tails. Color coding is the
same as that in (b).

How about the resistive pulse waveforms? We addressed this
by assessing
the delay time for the two sensor configurations through an exponential
fit to the tails of the average Iion pulses
that yielded τdelay of 145 and 149 μs for the
PMMA back-covered and the polyimide front-covered chips (Figure 4d, see also Figure S9 for statistical distributions of τdelay). The slightly faster current decays than that of Lpoly = 16 mm are consistent with the lowered
capacitance suggested by the decreased noise level. More directly,
the two pulses completely overlap with each other at the tails demonstrating
that the capacitance charging time was adequately short compared to
the actual speed of the dynamic change in Iion upon the fast electrophoretic translocation of the polystyrene nanoparticles
(Figure 4b). It can
thus be concluded that polymer coating at the back-side surface is
equally effective for the front-covering for lowering the capacitance
to achieve better sensor temporal resolutions as well as a noise platform.
More quantitatively, when we assume that a τdelay of 145 μs is reflecting the actual translocation motions of
the nanoparticles, the capacitive effect on the effective delay time
τ = τdelay – 145 μs can be described
as τ = αRporeCnet with a coefficient α amounting 0.002. This finding
may be useful in building integrated nanopore structures as they usually
involve constructions of additional structures such as nanofluidic
channels, nanopillars, and nanoelectrodes on the membrane-side of
the chip surface,37−40 that makes the front-side coating technically difficult.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of experiments have been established to inspect
the influence of capacitance on temporal resolution of a solid-state
nanopore sensor by adjusting the contact area of the electrolyte solution
and thin dielectric layer on the substrate by polymer coating. The
results demonstrated that sufficient coverage of a thick polyimide
layer on the membrane-side of the surface could fasten the speed of
the response of the cross-membrane ionic current because of the lowered
capacitance by the organic layer. Learning from this finding, we designed
and verified to cover the PMMA layer at the back-side surface, which
provided an equivalent effect to that observed for the polyimide coating.
The back cover structure facilitates integration of nanofluidic structures
on the membrane side without compromising the sensor temporal resolution
of resistive pulse measurements.

Methods
Polyimide-Coated
Solid-State Nanopore Chip Fabrication
A silicon wafer having
both sides covered with low-pressure chemical
vapor deposition-grown 50 nm-thick Si3N4 layers
was used as the substrate. On one side of the Si, we placed a metal
mask and treated with reactive ion etching using CF4 as
the etchant gas to partially remove Si3N4 of
1 mm × 1 mm square area. The exposed Si was then dissolved in
KOH aq heated at 80 °C. By completely removing Si, we obtained
a 50 nm-thick Si3N4 membrane. On the membrane,
we spin-coated an electron beam resist (ZEP520A). Subsequently, a
circle of diameter 300 nm was delineated by standard electron beam
lithography (Elionix). After development, the remaining resist layer
was used as a mask to open a nanopore by reactive ion etching (CF4). The residual resist layer was removed by keeping the nanopore
chip in N,N-dimethylformamide (Wako)
overnight followed by rinsing in isopropanol, ethanol, and acetone.
The membrane-side of the Si3N4 surface was then
covered with a 5 μm-thick photo-reactive polyimide by spin-coating.
Using a photo-mask, we patterned and created a 50 μm diameter
hole in the polyimide. Here, the position of the micropore was centered
to the location of the Si3N4 nanopore. Also,
the photolithography created the polymeric sheet to have a width and
length of 5 mm and Lpore ranging from
1 to 16 mm, respectively. Finally, the polyimide was baked at 350
°C for hardening.

Back-Covered Nanopore Chip Fabrications
We first prepared
a nanopore chip by the aforementioned procedure based on electron-beam
lithography and reactive ion etching. After that, we spin-coated PMMA
(Aldrich) on the back side of the Si substrate, that is, the opposite
side to the membrane surface. There, we protected the deep Si trench
from being coated with PMMA by adhering a small piece of the plastic
tape. The PMMA cover was then baked at 180 °C. Finally, the PMMA
surface was coated with 20 nm-thick SiO2 by chemical vapor
deposition for adhering the PDMS block upon the ionic current measurements.
PBS was capillary-injected into the channel-integrated pore. Two Ag/AgCl
rods were then placed at the bottom side of a micropore and the outer
ends of the SU-8 microchannels via holes punched in a PDMS block.
The cross-pore ionic current Iion was
measured by applying the bias voltage Vb between the rods and recording the output current through pre-amplification
using a home-built current amplifier backed by a fast digitizer (NI-5922,
National Instruments). All the measurements were carried out at room
temperatures.

Resistive Pulse Measurements
A polymer-coated
nanopore
chip was sealed with two blocks made of PDMS (SYLGARD 184). For this,
we pre-treated the surfaces with oxygen plasma in prior to bond them
together. On the PDMS surface, we had a fluidic channel of width and
height of 1 and 0.3 mm, respectively, which was created by imprinting
on a SU-8 mold. Three holes in each block were used as an inlet and
outlet to introduce PBS (Nippon Gene) as well as a place to fix an
Ag/AgCl rod for ionic current measurements. The fluidic channel in
the membrane-side of the block was filled with PBS containing 200
nm-sized polystyrenes (PolyScience) while the other side was loaded
with PBS only. The cross-membrane ionic current was recorded by applying
0.1 V to the electrodes and pre-amplifying the output current with
a home-built amplifier followed by digitizing at 1 MHz using a digitizer
(NI-5922, National Instruments) and storage in a hard disk under a
LabVIEW program. PBS was capillary-injected into the channel-integrated
pore. Two Ag/AgCl rods were then placed at the bottom side of a micropore
and the outer ends of the SU-8 microchannels via holes punched in
a PDMS block. The cross-pore ionic current Iion was measured by applying the bias voltage Vb between the rods and recording the output current through
pre-amplification using a home-built current amplifier backed by a
fast digitizer (NI-5922, National Instruments). All the measurements
were carried out at room temperature.

Data Analysis
The open pore current was offset to zero
by subtracting a linearly-fitted component of the Iion–t curves in time windows of
0.5 s. Resistive pulses were then obtained by finding current minima
below −100 pA. Subsequently, 2000 points before and after the
local Iion minima were extracted. Average
resistive pulses were calculated as arithmetic means of the extracted
pulses. All the processes above were performed automatically using
a program coded in Visual Basic 6. Meanwhile, OriginPro software was
used for the exponential fit of the pulse tails.
