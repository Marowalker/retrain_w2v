In
this study, we investigated the catalytic properties of various
Heusler alloys for the hydrogenation of propyne and the oxidation
of carbon monoxide. For propyne hydrogenation, Co2FeGe
alloy showed a higher activity than that of elemental Co, where neither
Fe nor Ge showed any activity. This clearly indicates an alloying
effect. For the oxidation of carbon monoxide, although most alloys
showed a significant change in catalytic activity during measurement
due to an irreversible oxidation of the alloy, Co2TiSn
alloy showed a very small change. The results indicate that the catalytic
activity and stability of a Heusler alloy can be tuned by employing
an appropriate set of elements.

==== Body
1 Introduction
A Heusler
alloy is an intermetallic compound (ordered alloy) described
as X2YZ with an L21 structure (Figure 1).1 It is called a full-Heusler alloy in a narrow sense, whereas XYZ
with a C1b structure is called a half-Heusler alloy. Typically,
X and Y are transition metals in groups 3–8 and 8–12,
respectively, and Z is in group 13–15.2 Because many Heusler alloys are ferromagnetic, they have been mainly
studied as magnetic materials since the discovery of Cu2MnAl in 1903.3 In particular, they have
recently attracted much attention in the field of spintronics.4 There are also of paramount importance in other
fields, such as Ni2MnGa for a ferromagnetic shape memory
alloy5 and Fe2VAl for a thermoelectric
material.6 One interesting feature of Heusler
alloys is that their electronic structure can be tailored by elemental
substitution in accordance with the rigid-band approximation. This
enables tuning of the functional properties.

Transition metals exhibit various catalytic functions,
and their
catalytic properties are dominated by the surface and electronic structures
and defects. Alloying modifies the atomic configuration at the surface
and the electronic structure of any given element, resulting in variation
in the catalytic properties. An intermetallic compound is an extreme
alloy that exhibits a specific atomic arrangement at the surface and
an electronic structure completely different from that of its constituent
elements. Thus, intermetallic compounds have recently attracted attention
as new catalysts.7−9

Heusler alloys are potentially valuable catalysts
because there
are so many possible sets of elements and electronic tuning can be
done by elemental substitution. To our knowledge, there have been
no experimental studies on the catalytic properties of Heusler alloys;
however, only one theoretical study has appeared very recently.10 In this article, we describe our experimental
investigation of the catalytic properties of 12 Heusler alloys for
the hydrogenation of propyne and the oxidation of carbon monoxide
as a first step toward exploring new catalysts.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Characterization
Powder
samples of Heusler alloys were prepared by arc melting and annealing,
followed by crushing. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to characterize
the ordered structure. The diffraction pattern of L21-phase
was sufficiently observed for all of the samples, as shown in Figure 2. Although several
samples showed unknown extra peaks, their intensities were negligible
(Figure S2 and Table S1). Thus, samples
were almost of single phase.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of (a, b) Co2TiSn and
(c, d) Co2FeGe; (b) and (d) are calculated patterns. Inset
in (c) is magnified
image around 111 and 200 peaks along with calculated peaks (blue bars).

Many of Heusler alloys have two
disordered phases: B2-phase (Y–Z
disorder) and A1-phase (X–Y–Z disorder, i.e., completely
random) (Figure S1). Considering these
disorders, the degree of chemical ordering in Heusler alloys is typically
evaluated by Webster’s model using factors S and α.11 The S-factor corresponds to the long-range order parameter in the binary
alloy.12S = 0 means A1-phase,
and S = 1 means no disorder of X atoms. The α-factor
describes a disorder between Y and Z atoms. α = 0 means no Y–Z
disorder, and α = 0.5 means no Y–Z order. Thus, S = 1 and α = 0 indicate L21-phase, and S = 1 and α = 0.5 indicate B2-phase. These factors
are obtained by the following equations 1   2  where I200, I111, and Ifund are
the integrated intensities of 200 and 111 superlattice peaks and a
fundamental peak, respectively, the numerator is an experimentally
obtained value, and the denominator is the calculated value in the
perfect-order case. In our study, to avoid the influence of a preferred
orientation, the S value was estimated using a 400
peak for Ifund in eq 1, and the α value used was the average
of the ones estimated using Ifund for
the 220, 400, 422, and 440 fundamental peaks in eq 2. Table 1 shows the obtained S-factors and
α-factors. A high S value and a low α
value were obtained for all of the samples, indicating that the alloys
sufficiently ordered in the L21-structure.

a The SD value for S was estimated from the deviations
between experimental data and
fitting curve using Voigt function. The SD for α includes an
SD among α values estimated using Ifund for the 220, 400, 422, and 440 peaks, in addition to the fitting
errors. S = 1 and 1.0 mean that S values were somewhat larger than 1.0 and 1.00, respectively. α
= 0.0 means that the α value was smaller than 0.00 (negative
value).

2.2 Hydrogenation
of Propyne
A catalytic
reaction involving 1% C3H4 (propyne)/55% H2/He-balance mixture was investigated in a fixed-bed flow reactor
using a catalyst sample pretreated with H2 at 600 °C
for 1 h to remove surface oxides. The reaction was monitored during
heating the catalyst from 40 to 200 °C. To check the change in
the catalytic performance during measurement, the reaction was also
monitored during a cooling process and the second run of the heating
and cooling cycle. The catalytic activity in the first heating process
was higher than that in the rest of the processes, whereas the temporal
change was well settled in the second cycle (Figure S3). Thus, we discuss the results upon cooling in the second
cycle (Figure 3). The
Heusler alloy catalysts except Co2FeGe and Co2MnGe showed only a few percent C3H4 conversion
even at 200 °C, as shown by the open squares (Co2TiSn
as a representative) in Figure 3a. The Co2FeGe and Co2MnGe showed catalytic
activity with C3H4 conversions of 63 and 30%,
respectively, at 200 °C.

Figure 3 Catalytic properties for hydrogenation of propyne
(C3H4): (a) conversion of C3H4 and
(b) selectivity of products (upper: C3H6, lower:
C3H8). C3H4 conversions
for the other Heusler alloys were similar to those for Co2TiSn, which is shown as a representative alloy in (a). Data of elemental
Co were obtained using a commercial Co powder.

In preliminary experiments, commercial powders of Fe, Mn,
and Ge
were verified to show no catalytic activity for propyne hydrogenation,
whereas Co powder showed a certain level of activity, as shown in Figure 3a,b. Thus, Co atoms
were considered to mainly contribute to the catalytic activities of
Co2FeGe and Co2MnGe, so the product selectivities
were similar for these three catalysts. However, the Co2FeGe showed a higher C3H4 conversion than the
commercial Co powder even though the population of Co atoms in the
Co2FeGe is half of that in the Co powder (total surface
area was the same for each sample, as described in Section 3.2). This clearly indicates
an alloying effect on the catalytic activity through changes in the
atomic arrangement and/or electronic structure. On the other hand,
the Co2MnGe showed about half the C3H4 conversion of Co2FeGe. This difference was brought about
by the difference in constituent elements (Mn vs Fe), whereas both
the Fe and Mn powders did not show any activity probably due to too
strong adsorption of hydrocarbons. In general, the adsorption energy
of hydrocarbons on transition metals is higher for a lower group number,
as expected from the electronic structure derived by calculation.13 Thus, propyne adsorption sites consisting of
Co and Mn atoms are considered to be less active than those consisting
of Co and Fe. The difference in the dissociation yield of H2 is another possible reason. According to first-principles calculations,
in the minority spin state, the Fermi level lies in the band gap for
Co2MnGe,14,15 whereas it is at the bottom of
the conduction band for Co2FeGe.16,17 Because a high electron density at the Fermi level induces dissociation
of H2 through electron transfer from the catalyst to molecules,7 Co2FeGe with a larger number of electrons
is considered to have a higher activity for propyne hydrogenation.

As discussed above, the tested Heusler alloys except Co2FeGe and Co2MnGe showed very low activity. Here,
we discuss why their activities were much lower than those of Co2FeGe and Co2MnGe. The first factor is the difference
in the electronic structure. The density of states for Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe, and Co2MnSn are very similar,15 whereas only the Co2MnGe showed a
relatively high activity. Thus, the electronic structure is unlikely
the sole reason. The second factor is the formation of inactive surface
oxides. Many of the samples included base metals that have very stable
oxides, as can be seen from the standard Gibbs energies of formation
(ΔGf°, Table 2).18,19 If the presence of
surface oxides was the cause, as the Co2MnGe showed activity
in catalytic reaction, the surface oxides of Mn and the other elements
in Table 2 with ΔGf° smaller than Mn were probably reduced
upon heating under H2 flow. In contrast, the surface oxides
of Al, Si, and Ti were hardly removed by the H2 reduction.
Because Fe–Ti–O natural surface oxides decompose into
Fe and TiO2 when heated under a H2 atmosphere,20 it is likely that such residual surface oxides
substantially decreased the active ensembles in the alloys containing
Al, Si, and/or Ti. In contrast, for the Ni2MnSn and Co2MnSn alloys, which showed very low activity, the surface oxides
were likely reduced because the ΔGf° values for NiO, CoO, and SnO2 are larger than those
for MnO. A plausible reason for the low level of activity is the surface
segregation of Sn, which inhibits H2 dissociation,21 because its surface energy is much lower than
that of Ni, Co, and Mn.22 In addition,
according to the theoretical calculation for a stable surface termination
on Co2MnZ(100) (Z = Si, Ge, Sn), the Co termination becomes
unstable with an increasing number of core electrons of Z atoms; Mn,
Z, and MnZ-mixed terminations become stable; and Co termination should
be impossible, especially for Z = Sn.23 It is thus presumed that catalytically active Ni and Co atoms were
embedded underneath the surface, resulting in the observation of low
catalytic activity.

2.3 Oxidation of Carbon Monoxide
As with
the propyne hydrogenation, the measurement was conducted in the fixed-bed
flow reactor during two cycles of heating and cooling in the temperature
range of 80–600 °C. A CO-rich mixture (1.2% CO/0.4% O2/He-balance) was used as a reactant to suppress the irreversible
oxidation of catalysts. While selected results are discussed here,
all of the results are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5). Figure 4 shows the conversion of CO in the carbon
monoxide oxidation upon heating in the first cycle. It is important
to note that the ideal CO conversion was 66.7% when only CO + (1/2)O2 → CO2 occurred without any other reactions,
such as the irreversible oxidation of catalyst, as the concentration
ratio in the reactant was CO/O2 = 3:1. For X2TiSn, X2TiAl, and X2MnSn (Figure 4a–c), X = Co showed
a higher activity than other alloys. This tendency is similar to that
for the elemental catalysts (commercial powders) (Figure 4d). Thus, element X probably
played the main role in the catalytic reaction for the carbon monoxide
oxidation.

Figure 4 Conversion of CO in oxidation of carbon monoxide by (a) X2TiSn, (b) X2TiAl, (c) X2MnSn, and (d) elemental
X catalysts (commercial powders) under CO-rich condition (CO/O2 = 3:1). Color symbols of each X in (a)–(c) correspond
to those represented in (d). Data are for the first heating process.
CO conversion beyond 66.7% by elemental Cu at higher temperatures
in (d) indicates reduction of Cu oxide formed at lower temperatures.

Figure 5a1,b1,c1
shows the CO conversion in all of the thermal processes for the X2TiSn alloys. The Fe2TiSn and Ni2TiSn
exhibited hysteresis between each thermal process, as shown in Figure 5a1,c1, which indicated
a change in the surface states of catalysts during the reaction. Such
hysteresis was also observed for most alloys (Figure S4). The behavior of hysteresis was different for each
alloy; for example, Figure 5a1 shows that only the second heating datum is substantially
different from that of the others, whereas Figure 5c1 shows three types of curves: the first
heating, the second heating, and two coolings. Thus, it is difficult
to fully reveal the origin of such complex behaviors. In contrast,
the Co2TiSn alloy did not exhibit significant hysteresis
even though the elemental Co (commercial powder) showed a certain
level of hysteresis, as shown in Figure 5b1,d1. The component of the O2 conversion consumed for the irreversible oxidation of these catalysts
was estimated using (O2 conversion) – 3/2 (CO conversion),
as shown in Figure 5a2,b2,c2,d2. The irreversible oxidations of the Fe2TiSn
and Ni2TiSn were much greater than those of the Co2TiSn and elemental Co. Most of the other alloys also showed
significant irreversible oxidation (Figure S5). These findings indicate that the hysteresis in the CO conversion
curves was due to a complex oxidation behavior resulting from the
combination of individual oxidations of each element in the ternary
alloys.

Co under O2-rich condition (CO/O2) = (1:1).
Upper graphs for each material show conversion of CO. Lower graphs
show conversion of O2 consumed for irreversible oxidation
of catalyst. Data points were divided among thermal processes, as
are shown by legends in (a1) and (a2). Heating: filled symbols; cooling:
open symbols; first cycle: deep and pale green squares (CO) and red
and pink circles (O2); and second cycle: deep and pale
orange diamonds (CO) and deep and pale blue triangles (O2).

To get insight into the stability
of Co2TiSn, a catalytic
measurement with an O2-rich reactant (CO/O2 =
1:1, each concentration: 0.67%) was performed for the Co2TiSn and elemental Co, as shown in Figure 5e1,e2,f1,f2 (irreversible oxidation: (O2 conversion) – 1/2 (CO conversion)). Although the hysteresis
was enhanced for both samples compared to that under the CO-rich condition,
the irreversible oxidation was obviously smaller for the Co2TiSn than that for the elemental Co.

Figure 6 shows the
XRD patterns obtained after O2-rich measurement. For the
elemental Co, the peak intensities of the oxides were higher than
those of metallic Co (hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered
cubic (fcc)). In contrast, for the Co2TiSn, the oxide peak
was much lower than the metallic Co2TiSn peak. The appearance
of Co3Sn2 in Figure 6b is probably due to phase separation resulting
from the preferential oxidation of Ti. Although the origin of the
oxidation resistance of Co2TiSn is still unclear, this
resistance is considered to be the main reason for the stability of
the catalytic performance. However, the Co2TiAl showed
a large hysteresis (Figure S4b) even though
the irreversible oxidation was relatively small (Figure S5b). Thus, other factors must have affected the stability
besides the oxidation resistance, which is just one of the origins.

3 Methods
3.1 Preparation
and Characterization of Catalysts
Twelve Heusler
alloys listed in Table 1 were prepared from pure metallic sources (purity: >99.9%) by
arc
melting, followed by annealing (homogenization and then ordering:
conditions are listed in Table S1) under
an Ar atmosphere. Annealed ingots were crushed using a hammer and
a mortar and pestle, and the powder obtained was sieved to a particle
size of 20–63 μm for catalytic measurement and <20
μm for XRD measurement (the commercial Co powder was also sieved
to 20–63 μm as a reference catalyst). The XRD measurement
was done using the Bragg–Brentano geometry with Cu Kα
radiation (Rigaku, Ultima IV Diffractometer) to determine whether
the sample was of single phase or not and the degree of chemical ordering.
The powder sample was annealed at 600 °C for 1 h under a H2 atmosphere (the same condition as that of the pretreatment
of the catalyst) before the XRD measurement to remove the strain and
defects introduced due to the crushing. The degree of order was evaluated
using factors S and α estimated from the intensity
ratio of the superlattice and fundamental peaks using eqs 1 and 2, respectively,
as described in Section 2.1. Theoretical intensity ratios in the perfect-order case in eqs 1 and 2 were calculated from the atomic scattering factors, including the
anomalous dispersion terms30 the multiplicity
factor, the Lorentz–polarization factor, and the Debye–Waller
factors.31,32

The surface area of the powder catalyst
after H2 pretreatment (Table S1) was estimated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
with Kr adsorption (MicrotracBEL, BELSORP-max volumetric adsorption
instrument).

3.2 Evaluation of Catalytic
Properties
Catalytic measurements were conducted in a standard
fixed-bed flow
reactor. The hydrogenation of propyne (aC3H4 + bH2 → cC3H6 + dC3H8) and the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO + (1/2)O2 → CO2) were used as typical catalytic reactions.
The reason for using propyne (C3H4: HC≡C–CH3) is that the simplest alkyne, acetylene, easily produces
oligomers, and further oils in a catalytic reaction then poison the
catalyst. The reactants used were gaseous mixtures: 1% C3H4/55% H2/He-balance for the propyne hydrogenation
and 1.2% CO/0.4% O2/He-balance for the carbon monoxide
oxidation. The carbon monoxide oxidation was conducted under a CO-rich
condition (CO/O2 = 3:1) to suppress the irreversible oxidation
of the catalyst. The carbon monoxide oxidation with 0.67% CO/0.67%
O2/He-balance (O2-rich condition) was also performed
for the Co2TiSn and the commercial Co powder catalysts.

The catalyst was supported on quartz wool in a quartz tube with
a 4 mm internal diameter and surrounded by an electric furnace. The
amount of catalyst was employed such that the total surface area (At) was 0.027 m2, and the flow rate
of reactants (F) was fixed to 30 mL min–1, meaning that At/F was
the same for all measurements. Therefore, the data obtained can be
compared without normalization (the reaction yield is proportional
to At/F (=Avtc = Av/SV, Av: surface area per volume; tc: contact time; SV: space velocity)).

Before measurement, heating of the catalyst under a H2 gas flow at 600 °C for 1 h was carried out to remove the surface
oxides. After cooling to room temperature, the reactant mixture was
introduced through mass flow controllers into the catalyst channel.
The products and unreacted reactants were monitored using a gas chromatograph
(Agilent, 490 Micro GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
and two columns: Molesieve 5A and PoraPLOT Q) during the continuous
heating and cooling of the catalyst. Temperature range, heating and
cooling rates, and sampling step were 40–200 °C, 2.5 °C
min–1, and 5 °C, respectively, for the propyne
hydrogenation, and 80–600 °C, 5 °C min–1, and 10 °C, respectively, for the carbon monoxide oxidation,
although the actual cooling rates were lower than the set rates, especially
below 200 °C. The heating and cooling cycle was run twice to
check the change in the catalytic performance during measurement.

The catalytic properties for the propyne hydrogenation were investigated
using the conversion of C3H4 ((Crea – Cpro)/Crea) and a selectivity of products (CC3H6 or CC3H8/(CC3H6 + CC3H8)),
where Crea and Cpro are the concentrations of C3H4 in
the reactant and the product, respectively, and CC3H6 and CC3H8 are the concentrations
of C3H6 and C3H8 in the
product, respectively. Products resulting from the decomposition and
oligomerization of hydrocarbons were not detected below 200 °C.
For the carbon monoxide oxidation, the catalytic properties were investigated
using the conversions of CO and O2 in a manner analogous
to that for the propyne hydrogenation.

4 Conclusions
Twelve kinds of Heusler alloys with highly ordered L21 single phases were investigated in terms of catalysis. For propyne
hydrogenation, the Co2FeGe alloy showed a higher activity
than the elemental Co even though the elemental Fe and Ge did not
show activity, which indicates an alloying effect. The Co2MnGe showed a lower activity than the Co2FeGe, which is
attributed to the difference in the electronic structure. However,
the other alloys showed very low activity. One possible reason for
the low activity is the embedding of catalytically active atoms under
the surface with residual oxides and/or nonactive elements. For the
carbon monoxide oxidation, the alloys with X = Co in X2YZ showed a higher activity than the other alloys with X = Fe, Ni,
and Cu, which was similar to the tendency in elemental X powders.
Thus, element X in X2YZ apparently played the main role
in the catalytic reaction. While most of the other alloys showed hysteresis
in the activity for the cycles of heating and cooling due to the irreversible
oxidation of the alloy, the Co2TiSn alloy showed a very
small hysteresis. The stability of the Co2TiSn is attributed
to the high resistance to irreversible oxidation. Our findings indicate
that a suitable catalyst can be developed for a variety of target
reactions by using Heusler alloys consisting of appropriate elements.
