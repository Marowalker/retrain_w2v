Frozen
tofu is a famous Asian food made by freezing soft bean curds,
which are naturally porous to store flavor and nutrients. When the
narrow pores of the soft bean curd are saturated with water and then
frozen, pore widths expand to generate a completely new porous structure—frozen
tofu has visibly wider pores than the initial bean curd. Intriguingly,
this principle can be generalized and applied to manipulate micro/nanopores
of functional porous materials. In this work, we will manipulate the
pore size of nanoporous polymeric photonic crystals based on the phase
change between water and ice. Wet-drying and freeze-drying methods
were applied to shrink or expand the pore size intentionally. This
principle is validated by directly observing the optical reflection
peak shift of the material. Owing to the change in pore size, the
reflection peak of the polymeric photonic crystal structure can be
permanently, and intentionally, tuned. This simple but elegant mechanism
is promising for the development of smart materials/devices for applications
ranging from oil/water membrane separations, health monitoring, and
medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring, anticounterfeiting,
and smart windows.

Introduction
Nanoporous materials
are widely used for water and air pollution
control, environmental catalysis, industrial separations, mechanical
buffering, thermal and acoustic insulation, implantable bioscaffolds,
supercapacitors, and batteries.1−5 For each of these applications, the pore width of the nanoporous
materials is of the utmost importance, often for controlling their
performance. Porous materials are also established as optical elements
for colorimetric humidity and/or chemical sensors.6−8 For instance,
micro-/nanoporous photonic crystals (PhCs) have been developed using
self-assembly9−11 and holographic lithography12−14 methods to
spatially tune the distribution of polymer-rich (P-rich) and void-rich
(V-rich) regions within subwavelength dimensions. Therefore, the created
photonic bandgaps can result in controlled reflection at selected
wavelengths.15−17 Our previously reported spatially graded polymeric
PhC structure is an example.18−20 For a given porous material,
however, pore size distributions cannot be easily tailored or intentionally
modified, especially postpreparation. This is due to low Young’s
moduli and thermal expansion coefficients of the materials. A method
providing intentional pore width manipulation has not been developed.
This is a grand challenge for nanomanufacturing and materials engineering,
at both fundamental and applied levels.

Inspired by the frozen
tofu mechanism, in this work, we report
a method to address this technical challenge for nanoporous material
engineering. This method exploits the volume change of liquids during
a phase change. As long as the liquid can diffuse into the pores of
hydrophilic materials, one can manipulate the system temperature to
control liquid-to-solid phase changes and introduce a volume change
of micro-/nanopores. This technology is developed to tune the microscopic
pore size of hydrophilic porous materials. Using liquid mixtures with
different volume change properties, the desired volume change can
therefore be controlled, enabling accurate control of resulting pore
sizes. Figure 1a shows
the morphology change when going from bean curd to frozen tofu. This
process is graphically illustrated by the cross-sectional images in Figure 1b. To demonstrate
its feasibility, in this work, we select nanoporous polymer PhC gratings15,18−20 as a test bed. Specifically, we will fill these hydrophilic
porous polymeric materials with water and control its adjacent environment
temperature to change the volume of ice in the nano-/micropores of
the material. Owing to the phase change volume expansion of water
droplets isolated in nanopores, nanopore widths are permanently increased
by ∼10%/phase change cycles.21 As
a result, the pore size can be intentionally manipulated, causing
a reflection color change for the polymeric PhC structure. By monitoring
this reflection peak wavelength shift during freezing–melting
cycles, one can track changes to the pore size of the material. Importantly,
this mechanism is general, only requiring water adsorption in pores.
Previously viewed as challenging, straightforward control of water
and temperature enables accurate engineering of micro-/nanopores.
Pores with selected dimensions pave the way toward the development
of smart materials/devices for applications ranging from water/oil
membrane separation and biomedical sensing to environmental monitoring,
anticounterfeiting, and smart windows.

Results
Frozen Tofu Manipulation of Nanoporous Polymer PhC Structures
under Wet-Drying
The porous polymeric PhC sample used in
this experiment relies on phase separation materials.15,18 During the photopatterning process, the prepolymer syrup was exposed
to interference patterns introduced by the incident laser beam. In
the constructive interference regions, the chain extension (polymerization)
between the monomers will occur, thus repelling the solvent to the
destructive interference regions. Postcure using an UV lamp, the solvent
will evaporate upon removing the cover glass slide. The constructive
interference regions are called P-rich regions because they are mainly
filled with polymer materials, and the destructive interference regions
are called V-rich regions because more voids are located in these
regions. Owing to the spatially manipulated refractive index distribution
of V-rich and P-rich regions within subwavelength dimensions of porous
polymer PhC structures, one can control their reflection peak, which
is an indirect indication of pore size manipulation. Importantly,
if the dimension of nanopores can be manipulated, the effective refractive
index of each layer can be changed and will result in a spectral position
shift of the reflection peak. To validate this prediction, we employed
the holographic lithography method18,20 to fabricate
a nanoporous polymeric PhC structure (see section 1 in the Supporting Information for fabrication details).
Its initial reflection peak is located at 548.8 nm (curve 1 in Figure 2a for the normalized
reflection spectrum; the raw data are shown in Figure S1). The sample was placed on top of a thermoelectric
cooler for in situ temperature control. When a drop of water was placed
on top of the sample, it immediately dispersed into the film, filling
the pores. As a result, the reflection peak shifted up to 573.1 nm
because the refractive index of the voids changed (curve 2 in Figure 2a). Subsequently,
the sample was cooled to −5 °C; ice formation was observed
with an optical microscope (see Movie S1). In this case, the reflection peak shifted to 574.2 nm (curve 3
in Figure 2a), indicating
a change of the effective refractive index in the V-rich region. When
the sample was warmed, the ice melted and its reflection peak further
shifted to 577.7 nm (curve 4 in Figure 2a) because the newly expanded pores are filled with
water, which has a larger refractive index than ice. More intriguingly,
when the sample is dried, the reflection peak shifted to 546.9 nm
(curve 5 in Figure 2a), which is smaller than the original reflection peak (548.8 nm),
indicating a permanent change to the porous PhC structure. With cycling,
further shifts toward the two ends compared with the previous cycle
were observed (i.e., curves 6–9 for cycle 2 in Figure 2a and curves 10–17 in Figure S2 for cycles three and four). For clarity,
peak wavelengths are highlighted in the top panel. Results confirm
that pore size can be manipulated by repeating the ice-expansion process,
until the sample cracks after four cycles because of mechanical limitations
of the porous network of the polymer (Figure 2b). It should be noted that if the sample
is never frozen, its optical reflection spectrum can only be tuned
between curves 1 and 2 (i.e., from 548.8 to 573.1 nm). No further
shifts are observed if the nanopores do not expand. Next, we analyze
these optical signals in detail to interpret relationships between
the reflection peak shift and the geometric features of PhC materials.

Quantitative Analysis
Owing to randomness
in the structure
of many porous polymeric materials, it is challenging to characterize
the pores using direct measurements (e.g., SEM, TEM, etc.). As shown
in Figure 2c, SEM analysis
of a clipped sample shows that the period of the as-produced polymer
grating is ∼200 nm. Following established procedures,22 an ∼190 nm thick polymer grating slice
is prepared for TEM characterization (Figure 2d), showing a periodic V-rich- and P-rich-modulated
structure with 15–150 nm pores. On the basis of this TEM image,
approximately 30% of the total area is occupied by pores. However,
because of its random and rough nature, it is difficult to extract
an overall change in period, pore size, or porosity of a bulk sample.
It is also questionable to conclude that a feature size is consistently
changing based on a single 190 nm slice because external stimulation
(e.g., cutting, milling, etc.) may impact the morphology of the sample.
To the greatest extent possible, optical techniques provide an indirect
and nondestructive way to characterize porous materials. High wavelength
resolution (∼0.1 nm) is helpful for discerning small changes
in average pore size of a thin film over small or large areas, as
observed here and discussed below.

According to previously reported
matrix analyses on the optical properties of PhC structures,23,24 one can extract averaged geometric parameters based on optical spectra
(see section 3 in the Supporting Information for details). Following this procedure, thicknesses (t) and effective refractive indices (n) for P-rich
and V-rich regions before and after each freeze-wet-drying cycle were
determined (columns “n” and “t” in Table 1). Importantly, the extracted data accurately measures geometric property changes
within the P-rich and V-rich regions of a bulk sample [column “t (nm)” in Table 1] over a large area. This cannot currently be accomplished
using microscopic characterization methods. The extracted period of
the grating is changed from 189.3 to 187.2 nm (cycle 1), 185.1 nm
(cycle 2), and 182.9 nm (cycle 3) as shown in column “P (nm)” in Table 1. The structure is nearly saturated (182.2 nm) in cycle
4, which is consistent with observations of sample cracking because
of mechanical limitations (lower panel in Figure 2b). To quantify geometric parameter changes,
thicknesses of the P-rich and V-rich regions (tp and tv, respectively) and the
period (P = tp + tv) are plotted in Figure 2e, showing that the polymer grating shrinks
after each freeze-wet-drying cycle. On the basis of change ratios
for these regions (Figure 2f), it is clear that the V-rich region is more impacted (the
red curve), confirming that the pore size change is the major physical
mechanism.

To further validate this conclusion, component volume
fractions
of P-rich and V-rich regions are extracted using the two-component
Bruggeman model25 1  Here, σp, and σv are volume fractions
of polymer and voids, respectively. , ; np, and nv are the refractive
constants for polymer and
voids, respectively (i.e., np = 1.51 and nv = 1).15 n is the
effective index of the porous polymeric material extracted in the
previous paragraph. As shown in Table 1, the volume fraction of voids, σv, also decreases after each wet-drying (WD) cycle, attributed to
the surface tension of water during evaporation. Although nanopores
expand when water freezes, their diameters ultimately decrease because
of surface-tension-induced collapse.26 Therefore,
the effective refractive index of the V-rich region increases and
its effective thickness decreases after the freeze-wet-drying process,
resulting in a blue shift of the resonant reflection wavelength (i.e.,
peak 1–5–9 in Figure 2a).

Understanding this freeze-wet-drying process
provides an opportunity
for selective manipulation of pore dimensions in nanoporous materials.
If surface tension-induced shrinking is avoided, pore widths can be
permanently increased, countering the shrinking observed in previous
results. In the case of expanded pores, the reflection peak shift
would be the opposite of what is observed in Figure 2a. Accordingly, this technique is expected
to provide opportunities to intentionally increase or decrease pore
widths, and the described optical method allows us to quantify these
changes. To validate this hypothesis, in the next section, we employed
freeze-drying (FD, i.e., ice removal that bypasses the liquid phase
to prevent surface tension-induced pore collapse) and then characterized
the reflection peak shift of the polymer PhC grating.

Freeze-Dried
Porous PhCs: Pore Expansion
FD (also known
as lyophilization or cryodesiccation) is a dehydration process based
on sublimation of liquid below its freezing point.27 It has been used for the manipulation of nanoporous materials
via hydrogel expansion.28−31 Because ice in the nanopores will not melt before
drying, the expanded pores should not collapse and the effective refractive
index in the V-rich region of the polymer PhCs should decrease. In
this case, the reflection peak should shift to longer wavelengths.
To validate this hypothesis, we selected a polymer PhC grating with
reflection peak at 622.7 nm (curve 1 in Figure 3a). When submerged in water, the reflection
peak shifts to 671.7 nm (curve 2 in Figure 3a). This wet sample was then freeze-dried
for 24 h (see Methods for details). As a result,
its reflection peak shifted to 631.1 nm (curve 3 in Figure 3a). This shift to a longer
wavelength is the opposite of what was observed for the freeze-wet-drying
sample in Figure 2a.
This supports our hypothesis: nanopores were permanently expanded
by ice, with no shrinkage during sublimation. Importantly, this process
can be repeated to further expand the nanopores, by ∼10% per
cycle (curves 4–6 in Figure 3a). The sample cracked during cycles 3–4 because
of the mechanical expansion limit of this polymer (Figure 3b). To better interpret the
observed optical reflection peak shift of the freeze-dried porous
PhC sample, we again performed geometric data extraction using the
aforementioned processing procedure (Table 2). Similarly, extracted thicknesses of the
P-rich region (tp), V-rich region (tv), and period (P) are plotted
in Figure 3c, showing
increases after each FD cycle. Void volume fractions in both P-rich
and V-rich regions (Table 2) show opposite trends compared to Table 1, supporting proposed mechanistic differences
associated with WD and FD. As shown in Figure 3d, major void volume changes again occurred
in the V-rich region (the red curve), demonstrating the ice-induced
nanopore expansion.

Although FD methods were widely used for the fabrication
of graphene
oxide porous monoliths,32,33 there is no attempt
to intentionally tune the pore sizes after the material/structure
fabrication. In particular, in these reports, the aqueous graphene
oxide solution was frozen followed by FD to achieve the porous monoliths
which is a replica of the ice crystal generated in the freezing process.
Depending on the temperature, the size of the ice crystal varies from
tens of microns to hundreds of microns. Therefore, the pore size of
the final monolith is in the micron-scale range. There is no literature
manipulated nanometer scale pores, which will be demonstrated
in this next section.

Accurate Spectral Tunability Using Partially
Filled Pores
On the basis of the aforementioned WD and FD
processes, we have
demonstrated methods to intentionally shrink and expand the pores
of polymeric PhC films. The reflection peak wavelength was changed
after each cycle, an indirect confirmation of the intended pore width
manipulation. However, this peak shift is not continuous because of
the given volume expansion (∼10% per cycle) during the water-to-ice
phase change. In this section, we aim to demonstrate more accurate
control over pore size changes using partially filled nanopores. To
do this, we selected a polymer PhC grating with an original reflection
peak at 621.0 nm (curve 1, Figure 4a). After filling with water and FD, its reflection
peak shifted to 637.1 nm (curve 2). The now-dry sample then underwent
a WD cycle, causing the reflection peak to shift back to 617.5 nm
(curve 3). To obtain accurate tuning between these two states (i.e.,
curves 2 and 3), we then placed the sample on a thermoelectric cooler
under ambient conditions (relative humidity of 22%). When the temperature
dropped to 2 °C, the reflection color of the sample obviously
changed (from Figure 4b to 4c, see also the first 4 min in Movie S2). Small droplets were observed on the
surface of the sample after ∼5 min, indicating that the pores
were saturated with moisture extracted from the air (Figure 4c shows the image after 6 min).
Knowing the time required to completely saturate the pores of the
sample (5–6 min, Movie S2), condensation
times of 2 and 4 min ± 2 s were used to obtain PhCs with partially
filled pores. Samples were then transferred immediately (5 ±
0.5 s) into the freeze-drier at −28 °C. After 24 h, reflection
peaks for the three samples shifted to 625.5 nm (2 min sample, curve
4) and 633.0 nm (4 min sample, curve 5). Because sample pores were
manipulated within the mechanical expansion limit of the solid, this
accurate and intentional pore width manipulation is repeatable. To
demonstrate this tunability, we repeated this process with another
three cycles. The data for cycle 2 are shown in Figure 4a (i.e., curves 7–8), and data for
cycles 3 and 4 are shown in Figure S4 in the Supporting Information. On average, the WD process shifted the reflection
peak back to 616.1 ± 1.3 nm (see curve 6 for cycle 2), and then
partial pore-filling followed by FD shifted the reflection peaks to
625.1 ± 0.8 nm (2 min, see curve 7 for cycle 2) and 633.3 ±
1.04 nm (4 min, see curve 8 for cycle 2). Importantly, after the four-cycle
treatment, the sample did not crack, contrasting previous observation
shown in Figures 2b
and 3b. Therefore, this experimental data demonstrated
that the optical property of the polymeric PhCs can be tuned multiple
times using the partial filling strategy when staying within the mechanical
expansion limit of the material. Intriguingly, although it has been
recognized that there are rich new physics related to microscopic
freezing, melting, and structure of water/ice in the nanoporous material,34,35 there are no nanomaterial engineering studies using water-to-ice
phase change. In particular, our experimental results indicate a new
research topic on dynamics regarding the permeation,36 nucleation, and growth37 of
water/ice in partially filled nanopores.

In conclusion, we developed a
nanomanufacturing process to accurately
manipulate pore sizes of nanoporous materials. Building upon our previous
progress in holographic patterning of nanoporous polymers,18−20 this work used porous photonic crystal structures to demonstrate
the feasibility of postproduction manipulation of nanopores. Reflection
resonances of polymeric PhC structures were intentionally decreased
or increased using WD and FD processes, respectively. Using matrix
analysis of the optical reflection properties of the PhC structure,
geometric features of the P-rich and V-rich regions were extracted
to show the manipulation of spatial feature sizes. Owing to the volume
change between water and ice in pores, the dimension of porous materials
can be controlled. Importantly, by controlling moisture diffusion
and partially filled nanopores, porous structures were accurately
and intentionally manipulated. Therefore, the freezing and melting
phenomenon associated with water confined in nanopores provides a
unique opportunity to manipulate different-sized pores, thereby providing
a new approach to address grand challenges in nanomanufacturing and
materials engineering. One can start from a given polymeric photonic
crystal structure and manipulate its optical property using post-WD
and post-FD processing. In this case, we do not have to change the
optical patterning system and run the fabrication for new samples.
This property is extremely important for real applications, for example,
adsorption of gas/aqueous phase pollutants using nanoporous materials.
The efficiency highly depends on the pore size distribution because
of the selective adsorption of nanoporous materials. Thus, intentionally
tuned pores can significantly enhance the performance of gas/aqueous
filters. This work also enables the development of smart materials
that can be readily exploited in scalable devices for industrial oil/water/gas
separations, health monitoring, medical diagnostics, environmental
monitoring, anticounterfeiting, and smart windows, so the expected
impact of the described methodology is expansive.

Methods
FD Process
The as-prepared sample was placed in the
freeze-dry system (FreeZone Triad model 74000 Series, Labconco) to
remove the water by freezing and vacuum drying for around 24 h. Specifically,
the sample was further frozen at −30 °C for 6 h under
vacuum as low as 0.018 mbar; then, the temperature was ramped to −10
°C at a rate of 0.25 °C/min and held at this temperature
for another 12 h; and finally, the chamber temperature was elevated
to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min and held for 6 h to
allow the solvent content to be completely sublimated. The vacuum
of the system was maintained at 0.018–0.014 mBar during the
entire process.

Optical Characterization
The reflection
spectra of
polymeric PhCs at normal incidence were characterized using a microscopic
Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (Bruker, VERTEX 70 + Hyperion
1000). The observation area for each sample was 500 μm ×
500 μm. The angle-dependent spectra were measured by a portable
spectrometer (Jaz, Ocean Optics). A stepping-motor-driven rotation
stage (SGSP-120YAW, Sigma Koki Co.) was used to precisely control
the incident angle of a broadband white light source (EQ-99-FC, Energetiq)
assembled with a collimator (RC04FC-P01, Thorlabs).
