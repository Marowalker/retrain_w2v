Herein, we present the results of
sulfonated polyaniline (SPANI)
and sulfonated poly(ether sulfone) (SPES) composite polymer electrolyte
membranes. The membranes are established for high-temperature proton
conductivity and methanol permeability to render their applicability.
Composite membranes have been prepared by modifying the SPES matrix
with different concentrations of SPANI (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20
wt %). Structural and thermomechanical characterizations have been
performed using the transmission electron microscopy, differential
scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic mechanical
analyzer techniques. Physicochemical and electrochemical properties
have been evaluated by water uptake, ion-exchange capacity, dimensional
stability, and proton conductivity. Methanol permeability experiment
was carried out to analyze the compatibility of prepared membranes
toward direct methanol fuel cell application and found the lowest
methanol permeability for PAS-5. Also, the membranes reveal excellent
thermal, mechanical, and physicochemical properties for their application
toward high-temperature electromembrane processes.

Introduction
Energy is the basic
requirement for human life. Most of the electrochemical
energy systems require polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) and thus
studied widely.1,2 The emphasis of present scenario
is on the generation of nonconventional energy because the conventional
sources of energy are continuously diminishing. Fuel cells are a promising
alternative for energy production that produces electrical energy.
PEM is an important component of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
cell (PEMFC), as they allow only appropriate ions to pass between
anode and cathode. The membrane required for PEMFC should not only
act as a barrier for methanol but also be a good conductor of protons.
Perfluorinated membrane, Nafion, is used as a polymer electrolyte
because it possesses high proton conductivity along with excellent
chemical stability at room temperature (RT).3 The main drawback of Nafion is its high cost and the loss of conductivity
at temperature above 90 °C, realizing its use in high-temperature
fuel cells.4 So, an inexpensive PEM having
better performance with comparative characteristics is the area of
interest to the researchers.

Aromatic conjugated polymer, polyaniline
(PANI), is a material
of considerable interest due to attractive electronic, electrochemical,
and optical properties that enable its application in the field of
biosensors, rechargeable batteries, fuel cell, supercapacitor, separation
science, and so on.5−12 PANI is intrinsically a conducting polymer with high ionic and electronic
conductivities and can be easily synthesized.13−15 Different types
of cation and anion exchange membranes have been synthesized to fulfill
such requirements.16,17 Inan et al. have prepared sulfonated
poly ether ether ketone (SPEEK) and fluorinated polymer-based PEMs
for their applications in fuel cell.18 Aili
et al. have synthesized a high-temperature PEMFC based on polybenzimidazole
and sulfonated polyhedral oligosilsesquioxane.19 Blend PEM based on sulfonated poly(1,4-phenylene ether-ether-sulfone)
and poly(vinylidene fluoride) have been synthesized for same application.20 Highly conducting PEM for fuel cell has also
been synthesized by Gahlot et al.21 Significant
amount of work has been performed on PANI-based membranes.22,23 Furthermore, composites based on functionalized PANI possess better
electrochemical properties.24,25 Sulfonated polyaniline
(SPANI) has more ion-conducting groups, providing the path for conduction
of protons in PEM and enhancing its solubility and mechanical properties.5 Lin et al. studied the externally doped sulfonated
polyaniline multiwalled carbon nanotube composites.26 Dutta et al. have reported a highly stable PEM by the blending
of partially sulfonated PANI and PVdF-co-HFP for direct methanol fuel
cell (DMFC) application.7 Sulfonated poly(ether
sulfone) (SPES), containing sulfonic acid groups in its backbone,
is a thermomechanically stable polymer with good film-forming properties
and widely used for PEMs and other applications.27,28

The present article describes the synthesis of SPANI, SPES,
and
its composite membranes for fuel cell application. SPANI possess excellent
stability and is easily synthesized. Incorporation of SPANI may improve
the performance of composite membranes. Various SPANI concentrations
have been incorporated within the SPES matrix, for example, 1, 2,
5, 10, and 20 wt %. The prepared membranes are analyzed for structural
and thermomechanical properties. Further, ionic conductivity at high
temperature and other physicochemical properties are analyzed.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Characterization of Prepared Materials
and Membranes
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of
PANI, SPANI, and composite
membranes are presented in Figure 1. The frequency at 1564 and 1436 cm–1 for PANI corresponds to the quinoid and benzenoid rings, respectively.31,32 Peaks at 1297 and 1115 cm–1 are assigned to C–N
and C=N stretching, respectively, for PANI. Stretching vibration
at 801 cm–1 is ascribed to the C–N+ bond in the PANI spectra. According to the FTIR spectra of SPANI,
a shift was observed in the peak positions as compared with PANI.
This shift is due to the protonation of PANI, resulting in the formation
of self-doped stable structure.33 Vibration
at 1042 and 1063 cm–1 are allocated to the asymmetric
and symmetric O=S=O stretching, respectively, and those
at 801 and 695 cm–1 are allied with the S–O
and C–S vibration, indicating the existence of sulfonic acid
species in SPANI. The interaction between SPANI and SPES polymers
is also determined by the FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 1c,e). Composite membranes yield several new
peaks, as presented in the spectra. The peaks at 3360 and 3234 cm–1 designate O—H vibration and stretching at
2942 and 2886 cm–1 specify the occurrence of O—H
(acidic group) in the SPES and PAS-5, respectively. Peaks close to
1170 and 1016 cm–1 in PAS-5 and 1025 cm–1 in PAS-10 are accredited to the asymmetric and symmetric vibrations,
indicating the presence of −SO3H group in the composite
membranes. A shift in the vibration frequencies in PAS-10 membranes
was observed as compared to PAS-5 due to the enhanced interaction
between polymer and SPANI. The uniform distribution of functional
group inside the membrane plays an important role, which was confirmed
by the IR imaging of the SPES and composite membranes as shown in Figures 2 and S-1. The images show the uniform distribution
of −SO3 group inside the SPES and composite membranes
between 1120 and 1190 cm–1. 13C solid-state
NMR spectroscopy of PANI and SPANI was also performed to analyze their
chemical structure, as presented in Figure S-2. The 13C spectra show characteristic peaks at a lower
field similar to PANI of emeraldine base and matched well with the
literature.34,35 The recorded Raman spectra of
PANI and SPANI in Figure S-3 confirms the
emeraldine structure.36 Functional groups
of PANI were found at ∼1645 cm–1 due to the
C—C of the benzenoid ring and at ∼1570 cm–1 due to the C=C vibration of the quinoid ring. The peaks at
∼1496 cm–1 and ∼1449 cm–1 are attributed due to the quinoid ring for C=N and C—C
stretching, respectively. However, vibration at ∼1341 cm–1 (C—N stretching of the quinoid ring) and ∼1288
cm–1 confirms the presence of functional groups
in PANI.37 In the case of SPANI, the peak
at 1546 cm–1 arises from the C—C stretching
of the benzenoid ring and that at 1341 cm–1 arises
from the C—N stretching.38 The ID/IG factor increased
on the functionalization of PANI. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra
of the synthesized PANI, SPANI, and composite membranes are shown
in Figure 3. The peaks
are observed at 12.1, 19.8, and 25° for PANI and at 11.9 and
18.16° for SPANI. The intensity of peaks in SPANI is less than
that of the peaks in PANI. This decrease in 2θ indicates the
transition of the crystalline regions of PANI to the amorphous structure
of SPANI because of the incorporation of −SO3H.39 Composite membranes reveal no sharp peak due
to the amorphous nature of SPES.

Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of SPANI at different resolutions are shown in Figure S-4A,B (TEM) and Figure S-4C,D (SEM). All of the images are well matched with the literature
reported previously.40,41Figure 4 demonstrates the atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and SEM images of composite membranes. Surface morphology can
be observed in the AFM images in Figure 4A,C, which shows the SPES, PAS-2, and PAS-10
membranes. The image of SPES presents a smooth structure with the
average roughness of 4.483 nm, whereas a significant increase in the
surface roughness is observed in the composite membranes from 10.44
to 11.62 nm for PAS-2 and PAS-10, respectively. It is clear from the
pictures that the average roughness tends to increase as the content
of SPANI within the membranes increases. The surface and cross-sectional
SEM images of PAS-5 and PAS-10 are shown in Figure 4D,F. The figure suggests a uniformly dispersed
granular kind of structure of SPANI over the SPES surface.

Stability of Material and
Membranes
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis
are used to evaluate the thermal stability of PANI, SPANI, and composite
membranes. PANI and SPANI show one-step decomposition (Figure 5). Evaporation of the absorbed
water and unreacted aniline can be observed below 150 °C. The
weight loss around 250 °C may be due to the decomposition of
sulfonic acid present in SPANI.42 The decomposition
temperature for SPANI is found to be higher than that of PANI because
of the higher thermal stability of sulfonic acid groups. The TGA of
the composite membranes is demonstrated in Figure 6; it is clear from the micrograph that all
of the membranes are subjected to weight loss, which is noticed between
50 and 150, 300 and 400, and 500 and 600 °C probably due to bound
water, sulfonic acid groups, and decomposition of polymer backbone,
respectively. PAS-20 shows the highest thermal stability among the
prepared membranes. The transition temperatures are investigated by
the DSC analysis. The DSC thermograph of PANI, SPANI, and composite
membranes is shown in Figures S-5 and S-6. The DSC of PANI displays two endothermic peaks at 97.8 and 268.8
°C; the first peak at 97.8 °C shows the disappearance of
moisture and the second peak at 268.8 °C shows the degradation
of PANI.43,44 In the case of SPANI, an incremental shift
is noted in both the peaks. In the DSC curve (Figure S-6) of composite membranes, endothermic peaks are
observed from 97 to 135 °C where composite membranes show the
endothermic peaks at higher temperature comparative to SPES membrane.
Mechanical properties of composite membranes measured by universal
testing machine (UTM) analysis are shown in Table 1 and Figure 7. The elastic modulus of the composite membranes increases
by SPANI content and reaches to 10.72 MPa for PAS-10 membrane. On
the other hand, the elongation at break decrease by the incorporation
of PANI into SPES. The stress on the membrane also increases by increasing
the PANI content and reaches to 39.96 for PAS-10 membrane. It is clear
from the data that the membranes have sufficient mechanical strength
and PAS-5 shows adequate mechanical stability for its applications
to the fuel cell.

Ion-Exchange
Capacity(IEC) and Water-Uptake Behavior
Physicochemical properties
of composite membranes are demonstrated
in Table 2. Water uptake
has an intense impact on proton conductivity, proton mobility, and
mechanical stability of the membranes.45 Water uptake increases with the increasing amount of SPANI. Maximum
water uptake is observed for PAS-20 membranes, that is, 19.87%. Water
retention capability λ for SPES is found to be 4.8, but it increases
for PAS-1, that is, 5.45, which is maximum among all of the membranes.
Afterward, the value of λ reduces to 5.36 for PAS-20 membrane.
Dimensional change is observed to be decreasing. Due to the hydrophilic
nature of SPANI composite membrane, more water molecules enfold the
sulfonic groups. Further, it is observed that membranes with high
water uptake exhibited lower dimensional change, that is, PAS-20.
The reason behind this phenomenon is the formation of dense and compact
structure, which hinders the accommodation of water. The IEC tends
to increase from SPES to PAS-5, but decreases for PAS-10 and PAS-20.
The rising number of sulfonic groups increases IEC, but the effect
becomes less as the amount of SPANI reaches between 10 and 20 wt %.
The presence of lone pair on N atoms in PANI and SPANI is responsible
for an increase in the IEC of the membranes.7

Proton Conductivity, Diffusion Coefficient,
and Electronic Conductivity
Proton conductivity of the composite
membranes is measured from
30 to 90 °C, and the data are presented in Figure 8 and Table 3. Methanol permeability and proton conductivity are
interrelated parameters.46 Reason lies
in the fact that the factor responsible for low methanol permeation
also impede the flow of water molecules through the membrane. However,
in our case, composite membranes reveal a low methanol permeability
along with a good proton conductivity. This can be explained by the
fact that SPANI chains possess a conjugated bond network, which enables
easy transport of protons within SPES polymer while blocking the path
of methanol. It can be seen that increasing the amount of SPANI up
to 5 wt % enhanced the proton conductivity, whereas a decrement is
observed in PAS-10 and PAS-20 composite membranes. There is a rise
in the proton conductivity values when moving toward higher temperatures
from 30 to 90 °C (90 °C is the maximum value attained as
the water starts boiling beyond this temperature). An increase in
temperature makes the proton diffusion through the membrane easy.
A high value of IEC is also an important factor because it provides
supplement to the acidic groups, thus enhancing the proton conductivity.
PAS-5 membrane shows the highest conductivity values and reaches up
to 18.9 × 10–2 S cm–1 at
90 °C, the value is equivalent to the reported value of Nafion
membrane at the same temperature.21 Conductivity
of the membranes rises because of the existence of more hydrophilic
proton conductive channels. However, in PAS-10 and PAS-20, the decrement
in ionic conductivity is due to the impeding effect of the aggregation
of SPANI.

To evaluate
the performance of composite membrane as an electrode,
the current–voltage characteristics have been analyzed by two-probe
method and are presented in Figure 9. The dramatic improvement in the I–V characteristics is observed for composite
PEM as compared to the pristine SPES. SPES shows insignificant increment
in current as compared to PAS-5 membrane. The phenomena of significant
increment in current for PAS-5 membrane can be elucidated as follows:
when a potential is applied to SPANI, the conducting channels are
formed between the anode and the cathode, which establishes an Ohmic
contact between the membrane and the electrode.47,48 Nonlinearity in I–V characteristics
confirms that semiconducting nature of PAS-5 composite membrane and
its use as a material for nanoelectrode.

Figure 9 Potential vs current
curves for SPES and PAS-5 membranes.

Conduction of proton in PEM is directly related to the activation
energy, which is the minimum energy needed for proton transport and
calculated by proton conductivity at different temperatures. The activation
energy for proton conduction is calculated by Arrhenius plot (Figure 8).49 The activation energy for SPES membrane gives a value of
21.08 kJ mol–1, which is reduced by 32% upon addition
of 5% SPANI in SPES, as displayed in Table 3. Nernst–Einstein equation is used
to calculate the proton diffusion coefficient for composite membranes,
and the values are also presented in Table 3. The value of diffusion coefficient for
composite PEMs is improved by increasing the SPANI content, indicating
its applicability for DMFC application.

Dynamics of Hydrated Proton
in Composite Membranes by Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) Measurements
Proton self-diffusion
coefficient in PEMs is determined by the MRI technique. Details are
included in the Supporting Information.
The relaxation time and the self-diffusion coefficient of water–proton
cluster are closely related to the dynamics of the hydrated protons
in the membrane’s channel, which reflect the characteristics
of proton–water cluster and proton conductivity. The average
self-diffusion coefficient of hydrated proton for fully hydrated composite
membranes is calculated by the fitting of intensity attenuation versus B-values curve, and the corresponding values and diffusion-weighted
MRI images of the membranes are presented in Table 4 and Figure 10, respectively. Table 4 shows that the self-diffusion of fully hydrated SPES
membrane at 295.5 K has a value of about 1.625 × 10–10 m2 s–1 compared with 1.746 × 10–10 m2 s–1 for PAS-5 membrane,
which is in the order of values calculated by impedance spectroscopy.
The spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) for all of the composite membranes is presented in Table 4; their diffusion-weighted magnetic
resonance images are shown in Figure S-7. The spin–lattice relaxation time (T1) for SPES membrane is found to be 214.85 ms, which is increased
by 50% (323.09 ms) for PAS-5 membrane. It reveals an enhancement in
the intramolecular interaction between 1H spins and 1H spins–lattice interaction with the addition of SPANI
causing an increase in the water–proton ionic cluster size
and their connectivity with the membrane channels/neighboring ionic
cluster. It has been already proposed that proton transport in the
proton-exchange membrane proceeds through the ionic cluster.50,51 The enhancement in ionic mobility may be due to the presence of
higher water content and more interconnected ionic cluster region.
The results suggest that the incorporation of SPANI increases the
size and the number of interconnected ionic cluster region, which
enhance the proton conductivity.52

MRI images for different composite membranes.

Methanol Permeation (Pm) for Composite
Membranes
Low methanol permeability is the prerequisite for
the application of polymer electrolyte membranes in DMFC. Methanol
permeability for the membranes is estimated as per reported procedure
and the results are depicted in Table 3.21 As the content of SPANI
increases in SPES, the methanol permeability decreases, as SPANI obstructs
the methanol crossover through membrane. SPES exhibits 3.27 ×
10–7 cm2 s–1 methanol
permeability, which reaches to 1.19 × 10–7 cm2 s–1 for PAS-5. This value of Pm is much lower than that of SPES membrane. Thus, the
incorporation of SPANI within the SPES matrix lowers the methanol
permeability and, hence, enhances the membrane suitability for DMFC.

Conclusions
Highly stable and conducting SPES–SPANI
composite membranes
have been synthesized successfully for energy applications. Methanol
permeation is significantly decreased after the incorporation of SPANI
in the SPES matrix. However, proton conductivity and IEC for the membranes
have also been enhanced without compromising its stability. Composite
membranes show good proton conductivity at temperature between 30
and 90 °C, with reduction in activation energy for proton conduction
by the introduction of SPANI into SPES matrix. PAS-5 membrane exhibits
the best results among all of the prepared membranes. The comparison
of PAS-5 with other reported membranes has been presented in Table 5. A maximum of 9.49
× 10–2 S cm–1 proton conductivity
has been achieved by PAS-5 membrane, which also displays an enhancement
in the proton conductivity with increasing SPANI. The comparable electrochemical
performance of SPES–SPANI membrane with higher thermomechanical
and chemical stabilities make it a perfect proton-exchange membrane
for high-temperature electromembrane application.

Experimental Section
Materials and Membrane Synthesis
Aniline, chlorosulfonic
acid, ammonium persulfate, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, dichloroethane, N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC), and methanol
were purchased from SD Fine Chemicals and poly(ether sulfone) (PES)
was purchased from Solvay Chemicals India Pvt. Ltd.

Polymerization
of aniline was done through a well-established method as described
by Bhadra et al.29 In a 1000 mL beaker,
a known quantity of aniline (1 M) and HCl (0.05 M) was added and the
mixture stirred for 5–10 min. Now, a solution of 0.1 M ammonium
persulfate is prepared in 10 mL water and added in the above solution
with stirring for 6 h at room temperature (RT). After 6 h, 50 mL of
methanol is mixed in the resultant solution to terminate the reaction.
The obtained deep green product is filtered, washed, and dried at
60 °C in vacuum oven for 48 h to obtain polyaniline (PANI). Sulfonation
of PANI is done by the method already reported.26 Dried PANI (7 g) is mixed in 50 mL of dichloroethane and
stirred for 1 h at 80 °C. Dilute chlorosulfonic acid is added
slowly in the solution at RT. The reaction is terminated after 3 h.
The resultant product is washed to get it neutralized and dried under
vacuum, labeled as SPANI. Poly(ether sulfone) (PES) was sulfonated
as the method described by Thakur et al. and denoted as SPES.30

Solution casting using doctor’s
blade is used for the preparation
of SPANI composite membranes. Known amount of SPANI is dissolved in
DMAC, followed by sonication for 3–4 h. The solution is mixed
in 20% SPES solution and stirred for 24 h to obtain a homogeneous
dispersion of SPANI. This solution is cast on a clean glass plate
using doctor’s blade method and kept for drying. The dried
membranes are further dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C for the
complete removal of the solvent. SPES composite membranes with 1,
2, 5, 10, and 20 wt % of SPANI have been prepared and designated as
PAS-1, PAS-2, PAS-5, PAS-10, and PAS-20, respectively. Schematic representation
of SPES/PANI composites is shown in Scheme 1.
