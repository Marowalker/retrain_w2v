Quaternary-ammonium-salt-type
amphiphilic gemini compounds (Cm-2-Cn X, where m and n represent the alkyl chain lengths; m =
4, 6, 8, 10; n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10; m ≥ n; and X indicates the counterion
BF4, PF6, OTf, FSA, or NTf2) were
synthesized by the quaternization of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine and n-alkyl bromide and
a subsequent ion-exchange reaction with five different counterions.
For comparison, the corresponding monomeric compounds (Cn X, n = 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) were
also synthesized. The melting points of the compounds were evaluated
using differential scanning calorimetry, and those with melting points
lower than 100 °C were treated as ionic liquids during the subsequent
measurements. The amphiphilic gemini compounds exhibited the lowest
melting points (44–49 °C) when bulky NTf2– was the counterion and the degree of dissymmetry between
the two alkyl chains was 0.4 < n/m < 0.75. However, their melting points were not similar to those
of the monomeric compounds with NTf2– and n = 4–10 (<29 °C). The gemini
ionic liquids exhibited significantly
lower conductivities and higher viscosities than those of the corresponding
monomeric ionic liquids. This is because of the decrease in the mobility
of the cation molecules caused by the gemini structure, in which the
two monomeric compounds are connected by a spacer. The gemini ionic
liquids also showed higher densities than those of the corresponding
monomeric ionic liquids, owing to the dimer of the gemini structure.
Further, the gemini ionic liquids were adsorbed readily at the air/water
interface and oriented themselves but did not show the critical micelle
concentration for the concentration range over which they could be
dissolved in water. The amphiphilic monomeric and gemini ionic liquids
also tended to form ion pairs in aqueous solutions, as the length
of their alkyl chain was relatively short.

Introduction
Ionic liquids are salts
consisting only of cation and anion and
exhibit melting points lower than 100 °C. Ionic liquids were
first reported by Wilkes et al. in 1992.1 These ionic liquids are stable in both air and water and are in
the liquid state at room temperature. Of late, they have been the
subject of extensive research efforts.2−4 They are known to be
environmentally friendly solvents because of their properties of nonvolatility
and nonflammability and are attracting interest as novel solvents
that differ from water and conventional organic solvents.2−7 There can exist several combinations of cation and anion in ionic
liquids. Hence, the physicochemical properties of these liquids, such
as their melting point, density, viscosity, polarity, and hydrophobicity,
can be controlled readily. Therefore, they are being explored extensively
for use as reaction solvents,2 electrolytes,2,5 catalysts,4−6 lubricants,8,9 and drug delivery systems.10 Ionic liquids with different structures and
functions, such as external-stimulus-responsive ionic liquids,11 magnetic ionic liquids,12 and cellulose-dissolving ionic liquids,13 have been reported, and the development of other novel ionic liquids
with better performance and greater functionality is expected in the
future.

Surfactants get adsorbed at the air/water or water/oil
interface
so that the surface free energy is lowered and form aggregates of
different morphologies, such as micelles and vesicles in aqueous solutions,
because of their amphiphilic structure, which consists of both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic groups. They are used widely in many applications
and products, including detergents, cosmetics, food, and paint, based
on their properties of interfacial adsorption and aggregate formation.
Of late, gemini surfactants, in which two conventional monomeric surfactants
are connected by a spacer, have attracted a lot of interest because
they show excellent surface-active properties, such as lower critical
micelle concentrations (CMCs) and a greater ability to lower the surface
tension than those of the corresponding monomeric surfactants.14−18

It is known that amphiphilic ionic liquids containing an alkyl
chain show surface activity and form aggregates in aqueous solutions
in a manner similar to surfactants.19 For
instance, it has been reported that amphiphilic monomeric ionic liquids
of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium and 1-alkylpyridinium salts show surface
activities in aqueous solutions similar to those of conventional surfactants.20,21 However, these amphiphilic ionic liquids are mostly imidazolium-based20,21 and amine-salt-containing protic-type compounds.22 So far, only gemini surfactants with hydrophobic, hydrophilic,
and spacer groups have been reported, and there have been few reports
on gemini ionic liquids,23−25 including quaternary-ammonium
salt-type amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids.25

In this study, quaternary-ammonium-salt-type amphiphilic gemini
compounds with alkyl chains of identical and nonidentical lengths
and bulky counterions (Cm-2-Cn X, where m and n represent the alkyl chain length; m = 4, 6, 8,
10; n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10; m ≥ n, X indicates counterion, which is one of the following:
BF4, PF6, OTf, FSA, or NTf2; see Figure 1a) were designed
and synthesized along with the corresponding monomeric compounds (Cn X, n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10;
see Figure 1b). This
was done with the aim of developing novel amphiphilic ionic liquids
that show the properties of both ionic liquids and surfactants as
well as those of gemini surfactants. We investigated their properties
as ionic liquids as well as their surface-active properties in aqueous
solutions. Further, we discuss the effects of the alkyl chain length,
number of alkyl chains, degree of dissymmetry of the chains, and structure
of the counterion of the ionic liquids on their properties.

compounds gemini-type Cm-2-Cn X, (b) monomeric-type Cn X, and (c) counterion X.

Results
and Discussion
Melting Point
The melting points
of the gemini and
monomeric compounds could be arranged in the following order, based
on the counterion present: PF6–, OTf– > BF4– > FSA–, NTf2–. Thus, the compounds
containing
FSA– and NTf2– had
the lowest melting points (Table S1). In
general, the radii of the above-mentioned anions can be arranged as
follow: BF4– (3.44 Å) < PF6– (3.60 Å) < OTf– (3.79 Å) < NTf2– (4.39 Å).26 The radius of FSA– can be
assumed to lie between those of OTf– and NTf2–, based on their structures. The melting
points of the compounds containing counterions FSA– and NTf2–, which have a bulky structure,
were very low. As stated previously, ionic liquids are salts consisting
of cations and anions, which undergo electrostatic interactions.27,28 Ionic liquids show low melting points as compared to inorganic salts
because they contain organic ions, which have bulky structures. On
the other hand, the melting points of the monomeric compounds, Cn X with n = 2, were higher
than 100 °C and could be arranged in the following order based
on the counterion present: Br–, BF4–, PF6– > OTf– > FSA– > NTf2– (Figure S1). Cn NTf2 compounds with n = 8 and
10 were liquid
at temperatures below 0 °C, and their melting points could not
be obtained. An increase in the length of the alkyl chain from 2 to
4 resulted in a significant decrease in the melting point; this was
true for all counterions. The attraction between the cation and the
anion is greater for shorter alkyl chains, while the van der Waals
interaction between the alkyl chains is stronger for longer alkyl
chains, resulting in a high melting point.29 The melting point increased with an increase in the alkyl chain
length from 6 to 8 because the van der Waals interactions between
the alkyl chains became stronger than the electrostatic interaction
between the cations and anions. A similar behavior has been reported
in the literature.30,31Figure 2 shows the relationship between the melting
point and degree of dissymmetry of the two alkyl chains, n/m (m ≥ n), for the amphiphilic gemini compounds Cm-2-Cn NTf2 (the values of
the melting points of the amphiphilic gemini compounds containing
the other counterions, namely, BF4–,
PF6–, OTf–, and FSA–, are listed in Table S1). The error in the melting points of the amphiphilic gemini ionic
liquids Cm-2-Cn NTf2 was ±0.6 °C. The melting points of Cm-2-Cn NTf2 were high for n/m = 1 (alkyl
chains of the same length) but were low for 0.2 ≤ n/m < 1 (except for m = 4). This
can be ascribed to the fact that the corresponding ionic liquids are
packed tightly because of the strong van der Waals interactions between
the alkyl chains owing to their high symmetry. It is known that a
dissymmetric molecular structure or the presence of flexible alkyl
chains leads to a decrease in the melting point because the lattice
energy in this case is low, resulting in poor crystallinity.27 Thus, it can be concluded that the amphiphilic
gemini compounds that exhibited low melting points did so because
of the presence of dissymmetric alkyl chains. It is worth noting that
the melting point of amphiphilic gemini compounds can be lowered to
approximately 40 °C without causing an increase in the van der
Waals force by varying the length (degree of dissymmetry) between
the two alkyl chains.

of
two alkyl chains, n/m, for Cm-2-Cn NTf2: orange triangle, down, solid, m = 4; blue
triangle, up, solid, m = 6; pink circle, solid, m = 8; and purple square, solid, m = 10.

For example, despite their asymmetric structure,
amphiphilic gemini
compounds C4-2-C2 BF4 (n/m = 0.5), C6-2-C2 BF4 (n/m = 0.33), and C6-2-C2 FSA (n/m = 0.33) showed higher melting points than those of C4-2-C4 BF4, C6-2-C6 BF4, and C6-2-C6 FSA, respectively, which
contained the same alkyl chains. It can be surmised that the former
gemini compounds exhibit high ionicity owing to their short chain
(n = 2) and are crystalized readily, even though
the van der Waals force between their chains is smaller. This is in
spite of the fact that the difference between the lengths of the two
alkyl chains is large. That is to say, there is a high degree of asymmetry
between the structures of the alkyl chains. On the other hand, the
melting-point behavior of Cm-2-Cn OTf was different from those of the compounds with
the other counterions, whose melting point increased as the chains
became more symmetric. This is because the van der Waals force increases
with an increase in the alkyl chain length. Thus, it was found that
the melting point of amphiphilic gemini compounds is significantly
influenced by the degree of asymmetry between the two alkyl chains
as well as the structure of the counterion present.

Characterization
of Amphiphilic Gemini Ionic Liquids
The amphiphilic gemini
compounds Cm-2-Cn X (with the exception of C4-2-C4 FSA,
C6-2-C2 FSA, C4-2-C2 NTf2, and C4-2-C4 NTf2) and the
monomeric ones Cn X
with FSA– or NTf2– (with
the exception of C2 FSA and C2 NTf2) were ionic liquids because their melting points were lower than
100 °C. The water contents of the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric
compounds were determined to be less than 500 ppm (Table S2); this suggested that investigation of the properties
of these ionic liquids would not be problematic. Figure 3 shows the plots of the zero-shear
viscosity and conductivity as functions of n/m (C10-2-C4 FSA and C6-2-C4 NTf2) and n (Cn FSA and Cn NTf2). Here,
the zero-shear viscosity was obtained from the relationship between
the viscosity and shear rate (Figures S2 and S3). The viscosities of the amphiphilic ionic liquids did not change
with increasing shear rate, indicating that they are Newtonian fluids
(Figures S2 and S3). The zero-shear viscosities
differed according to the structure of the ionic liquids. The viscosity
of gemini ionic liquid C6-2-C4 NTf2 was 3.35 × 103 mPa s and 30–40 times higher
than that of the corresponding monomeric ionic liquid. This can be
attributed to the fact that the van der Waals force between the two
alkyl chains enhances their degree of entanglement, resulting in high
viscosity. The viscosities of the quaternary-ammonium-salt-type ionic
liquids (both gemini and monomeric types) were higher than that of
the imidazolium-based ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
(50 mPa s) as well as those of the protic ionic liquids such as ethylammonium
nitrate (32 mPa s) and propylammonium nitrate (66.6 mPa s).32 The viscosity of ionic liquids depends on the
interactions that occur between their molecules, such as collisions,
hydrogen-bond formation, van der Waals interactions, and electrostatic
interactions: the stronger these interactions are, the higher the
viscosity will be.33,34 In general, it is known that
ionic liquids show viscosities 100–1000 times higher than those
of water and organic solvents because ionic liquids consist of a cation
and an anion and the electrostatic interactions between them are strong.
This, in turn, determines the viscosity.27,34,35 However, the amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids
showed extremely high viscosities, suggesting that their gemini-type
structure enhanced the van der Waals interactions between the two
alkyl chains.

conductivity
and degree of dissymmetry of two alkyl chains, n/m (gemini type), and alkyl chain length, n (monomeric type): black triangle, up, solid, C6-2-C4 FSA (50 °C); red triangle, up, solid, C6-2-C6 FSA (50 °C); black triangle, open, down, C8-2-C6 FSA (60 °C); orange titled square, solid, C10-2-C4 FSA (50 °C); sky blue square, solid,

green square, solid, C8-2-C6 NTf2 (60 °C); red circle, solid, Cn FSA;
and blue circle solid, Cn NTf2 (25 °C).

The conductivity of the amphiphilic
gemini ionic liquid C6-2-C4 NTf2 (2.84
mS m–1 at
50 °C) was 1/58 and 1/32 of those of the corresponding monomeric
ionic liquids, namely, C4 NTf2 and C6 NTf2, respectively. That is to say, the gemini ionic
liquid showed significantly lower conductivity than did the corresponding
monomeric ones. The charge mobility of gemini ionic liquids is small
because of their structure, in which two cation molecules are connected
by a spacer. The conductivity of gemini ionic liquid C8-2-C6 FSA was 5.2 times that of C8-2-C6 NTf2 at 65 °C; thus, the conductivity of
the ionic liquid containing FSA– was higher than
that of the ionic liquid containing NTf2–, in keeping with the conductivity behavior of monomeric ionic liquids
(Table S3). In the counterion NTf2–, the fluorine (−F) of FSA– is replaced with the trifluoromethyl group (−CF3). Further, FSA– has a more flexible structure
as compared to that of NTf2–. Therefore,
the ionic liquid with FSA– showed higher conductivity
and lower viscosity.36 The conductivity
of the gemini ionic liquids C8-2-Cn X reduced as their structure became more symmetric. This was
also the case when the length of the alkyl chains of the monomeric
ionic liquids was increased. This can be ascribed to the fact that
the van der Waals force becomes stronger and the mobility reduces
with these changes.

The quaternary-ammonium-salt-type amphiphilic
monomeric ionic liquids
Cn X exhibited lower conductivities compared
to those of the imidazolium-type ionic liquid 1-buthyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (4.06 × 102 mS
m–1)37 and protic ionic
liquids such as methylammonium formate (4.38 × 103 mS m–1),38 ethylammonium
nitrate (2.69 × 103 mS m–1),39 and ethylammonium acetate (222 mS m–1).40 In general, ionic liquids with an
aromatic part, where charge is delocalized, such as imidazolium-type
and pyridinium-type ionic liquids, show high conductivities and low
viscosities. However, quaternary-ammonium-salt-type gemini ionic liquids
show low conductivities and high viscosities. This is because of the
effects of the localized charge of the ammonium ion and the van der
Waals force between the alkyl chains. The conductivity of the ionic
liquids also increased with an increase in the temperature (Table S3), in keeping with the behavior of conventional
ionic liquids.

Ionic liquids show high densities (more than
1.0 g cm–3) because their structure consists only
of ions.29,41 The density of gemini ionic liquid C6-2-C4 NTf2 was 1.45 g cm–3 and higher than
those of the corresponding monomeric ionic liquids C4 NTf2 (1.40 g cm–3) and C6 NTf2 (1.33 g cm–3) (Table S3), indicating that the gemini ionic liquid was more densely
packed than the monomeric ones. The densities of the monomeric ionic
liquids with counterion NTf2– were higher
than those of the ionic liquids with FSA– and decreased
with an increase in the length of the alkyl chain. This result was
consistent with the trends seen in the case of conventional ionic
liquids.

Solubilities in Various Organic Solvents
The solubilities
of the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic liquids in various organic
solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, acetone, ethyl
acetate, chloroform, benzene, and hexane were measured by adding 0.01–10
mL of water or the organic solvents to 0.01–0.1 g of the ionic
liquids and then allowing them to settle down for at least 24 h. The
amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids showed low solubilities in water,
and the solubilities could be arranged in the following order based
on the counterion present: FSA > NTf2 (Table S4). The solubility decreased with an increase in the
alkyl chain length as well as when the two alkyl chains became more
symmetric. The gemini ionic liquids (Cm-2-Cn X, X = FSA and NTf2)
showed low solubilities in water but were soluble in organic solvents
such as DMSO and methanol at 25 °C (Table S5). The gemini and monomeric ionic liquids with FSA– and NTf2– also showed high solubilities
in acetone and ethyl acetate and excellent solubilities in organic
solvents with a wide range of polarities (DMSO, methanol, acetone,
and ethyl acetate). The monomeric ionic liquids also showed solubilities
similar to those of the gemini ionic liquids, with those having n ≥ 4 being soluble in chloroform and benzene. Further,
the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic liquids were insoluble
in hexane, whose polarity is low.

Solution Properties of
Amphiphilic Gemini Ionic Liquids
The solution properties
of the amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids Cm-2-Cn X (m = 4, 6, 8,
10; n = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10; X
= FSA and NTf2) (with the exception of C4-2-C4 FSA, C6-2-C2 FSA, C4-2-C2 NTf2, and C4-2-C4 NTf2) and monomeric ionic liquids Cn X (n = 4, 6, 8, 10; X = FSA and NTf2), including their Krafft temperature, conductivity, surface tension,
and pyrene fluorescence values, were determined.

Krafft Temperature (TK)
Clear aqueous solutions of the amphiphilic
gemini ionic liquids and
the corresponding monomeric ionic liquids (0.020–0.20 wt %)
were prepared by dissolving them in hot water and placing the formed
solution in a refrigerator at ∼5 °C for at least 24 h.
All of the amphiphilic ionic liquids with FSA– and
NTf2–, except for C4-2-C2 FSA and C6-2-C4 FSA, precipitated in
the solution. Next, the temperature of the cooled solution was raised
gradually under constant stirring, and the conductance (κ) was
measured over the temperature range of 0.5–5.0 °C. Further, TK was determined based on the relationship between
the electrical conductivity and the temperature (Figure S4). Initially, the conductivity increased rapidly
with an increase in the temperature because of the gradual dissolution
of the amphiphilic ionic liquids. Subsequently, it increased gradually
owing to the increase in the ionic mobility. TK was taken as the temperature at which the conductivity versus
temperature plot exhibited a break point. Tables 1 and 2 show the values
of TK for the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric
ionic liquids with FSA− and NTf2−, respectively. The TK values
of all of the amphiphilic monomeric ionic liquids were less than 5
°C, with the exception of C10 NTf2. The TK values of the amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids
were higher than those of the corresponding monomeric ionic liquids.
The TK values of the gemini ionic liquids
Cm-2-Cn FSA
containing alkyl chains of the same length (m = n) increased with an increase in the alkyl chain length.
As the length of one of the alkyl chains, m, of the
gemini ionic liquids Cm-2-Cn FSA was fixed at 6 or 8, TK was dependent on the length of the other alkyl chain, that
is, on n. Thus, it was found that the amphiphilic
gemini ionic liquids showed poor solubility in water as compared to
the corresponding monomeric ionic liquids because of the dimer structure
formed in the former case by the two hydrophobic alkyl chains as well
as owing to the presence of a hydrophobic counterion.

Conductivity, Surface Tension,
and Pyrene Fluorescence
Figure 4 shows the
plots of the conductivity, surface tension, and pyrene fluorescence
intensity ratio, I1/I3, as functions of the concentration for the gemini ionic
liquids C8-2-Cn FSA and monomeric
ionic liquid C8 FSA in aqueous solution. Figures S5–S8 show the plots of the conductivity, surface
tension, and pyrene fluorescence intensity ratio, I1/I3, of ionic liquids C4-2-C2 FSA, C6-2-Cn FSA (n = 4, 6), C10-2-C4 FSA (Figure S5), Cn FSA (n = 4, 6, 8, 10) (Figure S6), C6-2-Cn NTf2 (n = 2, 4, 6), C8-2-Cn NTf2 (n = 2,
4) (Figure S7), and Cn NTf2 (n = 4, 6, 8, 10) (Figure S8). The conductivity increased and surface
tension decreased with an increase in the concentration of C8-2-Cn FSA (n = 2–8)
and C8 FSA, and a break point was not observed for any
of the compounds with the exception of C8 FSA. Therefore,
the solubilities of the ionic liquids in water were poor because of
the presence of the hydrophobic counterion. Further, micelle formation
was not observed for the range of concentrations over which the ionic
liquids did not dissolved in water. This result was in keeping with
the pyrene fluorescence data, which showed that the I1/I3 value remained constant
(did not decrease) even with an increase in the concentration. For
C8 FSA, although a break point was observed in the conductivity
plot, it was not observed in the plots for I1/I3 and the surface tension. Thus,
the break point did not correspond to the CMC but was indicative of
the formation of an ion pair because ion pairs do not readily form
micelles owing to the shortness of their alkyl chains. This behavior
was also observed in the cases of gemini ionic liquids C4-2-C2 FSA, C6-2-Cn FSA (n = 4, 6), and Cm-2-C2 NTf2 (m = 4, 6, 8) and
the monomeric ionic liquids Cn FSA (n = 4, 6, 8) and Cn NTf2 (n = 4, 6) (Table 1 and Table 2). It has been reported that imidazolium-based ionic
liquids (n ≥ 8) with Cl–, PF6–, or NTf2– as the counterion form micelles in aqueous solutions, while that
with n = 6 does not form, instead forming a monolayer
at the air/water interface.42 It has also
been reported that amphiphilic compounds with a short alkyl chain
(n = 8) exhibit two break points in their conductivity
plots.43,44 The break points at the higher concentration
corresponded to the CMC, as confirmed by the results of the surface
tension and fluorescence measurements. Further, the break points occurring
at concentrations lower than the CMC were attributable to the formation
of an ion pair between the ammonium cation and the counterion. The
amphiphilic ionic liquids with a short alkyl chain did not exhibit
a second break point in their conductivity plot because of their poor
solubility in water. However, they show a single break point, which
corresponded to the formation of an ion pair.

fluorescence intensity ratio, I1/I3, with ionic liquid concentration for C8-2-Cn FSA and C8 FSA:

open, n = 4; blue square, solid, n = 6; red triangle, up, solid, n = 8; red triangle,
up, open, n = 8 (in the presence of NaBr); and black
circle, open, C8 FSA.

The adsorption and orientation of amphiphilic compounds at the
air/water interface are related to the surface excess concentration,
Γ, and the occupied area per molecule, A, which
can be calculated from the slope for the linear relationship between
the surface tension and the concentration and the Gibbs adsorption
isotherm equations. Tables 1 and 2 show the degree of dissociation
(α), Γ, A, and pC20 values as determined from the surface tension plots. The
values of A of the amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids
C8-2-Cn FSA were larger than
that of the corresponding amphiphilic monomeric ionic liquid C8 FSA. The addition of NaBr (0.50 mmol dm–3) to the C8-2-C8 FSA solution increased its
solubility and led to a decrease in the surface tension and the occupied
area per molecule. However, a clear break point, which would correspond
to the CMC, was not observed at the concentrations at which the ionic
liquid dissolved in water. The occupied area per molecule of C8-2-C8 FSA in the presence of NaBr became smaller
than that of C8 FSA in the absence of NaBr, indicating
that the former would get adsorbed readily at the air/water interface
because of the decrease in the electrostatic interaction between its
hydrophilic groups after the addition of the salt. It has been reported
that imidazolium-based ionic liquids with BF4– as the counterion form micelles in aqueous solutions, exhibit CMC
values lower than those of ionic liquids containing Br–, and are readily adsorbed at the air/water interface.19 The values of the efficiency of adsorption,
pC20, of the gemini ionic liquids (2.6–3.6)
were larger than that of the corresponding monomeric one (2.4). This
was particularly true as the lengths of the two alkyl chains became
similar. The pC20 value increased further
with the addition of the salt. The larger the pC20 value is, the more efficiently amphiphilic ionic liquids
are adsorbed at the air/water interface.45 Thus, it was confirmed that these quaternary-ammonium-salt-type
amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids would be adsorbed efficiently at
the air/water interface, even though they did not form micelles in
aqueous solutions. The A values of gemini ionic liquids
C6-2-Cn NTf2 (n = 2, 4, 6) increased in the order of n = 2 (1.44 nm2) < n = 6 (1.50 nm2) < n = 4 (1.73 nm2), while
their pC20 values increased in the order
of n = 2 (2.9) < n = 4 (3.2)
< n = 6 (3.7). Thus, it can be concluded that
C6-2-Cn NTf2 will
be adsorbed readily at the air/water interface as n is increased from 2 to 4, while for C6-2-Cn NTf2 with n = 6, the
symmetric alkyl chains are adsorbed in a large number at the interface.

Conclusions
In this study, quaternary-ammonium-salt-type
amphiphilic gemini
compounds with two alkyl chains having identical and nonidentical
lengths and their corresponding monomeric amphiphilic compounds were
synthesized using five different counterions (BF4–, PF6–, OTf–, FSA–, and NTf2–). Their physicochemical
properties, such as their melting point, conductivity, viscosity,
density, and solubility, in various organic solvents, as well as their
aqueous-solution properties, such as their conductivity, surface tension,
and pyrene fluorescence, were investigated.

It was found that
the melting points of the quaternary-ammonium-salt-type
amphiphilic gemini compounds Cm-2-Cn X are significantly affected by the degree
of dissymmetry between the two alkyl chains (n/m). Further, they can be decreased significantly through
the ion exchange of the bromide ion with a bulky counterion (BF4–, PF6–, OTf–, FSA–, or NTf2–). The melting points of the amphiphilic gemini compounds were high
when the two alkyl chains in the molecules had the same length (n/m = 1) and were low for 0.2 ≤ n/m <1. More notably, the melting point
of the gemini ionic liquids could be decreased to approximately 40
°C by changing the n/m ratio
as well as the counterion. The amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids showed
lower conductivities, higher viscosities, higher densities, and higher
solubilities in organic solvents as compared to the corresponding
monomeric ionic liquids. Further, the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric
ionic liquids with short alkyl chains showed a small break point in
their conductivity–concentration curves, which corresponded
to the formation of an ion pair. The addition of a salt to aqueous
solutions of the amphiphilic gemini ionic liquids resulted in enhanced
adsorption and improved orientation at the air/water interface as
compared to the case for aqueous solutions of the gemini ionic liquids
and the corresponding monomeric ionic liquids free of a salt.

In this study, we elucidated the effects of the alkyl chain length,
number of alkyl chains, structural dissymmetry, and counterion structure
on the physicochemical and aqueous-solution properties of quaternary-ammonium-salt-type
amphiphilic ionic liquids. The development of amphiphilic ionic liquids
that exhibit properties of both ionic liquids and surfactants is difficult,
given the challenges faced in lowering their melting point and improving
their solubility in water. In the future, it is expected that it will
be possible to synthesize novel amphiphilic ionic liquids with high
performance and functionality through molecular design for use in
various industrial applications.

Synthesis of N,N-Dimethyl-N-[2-(N′,N′-dimethylamino)ethyl]alkylammonium
Bromide
First, n-butyl bromide, n-hexyl bromide, n-octyl bromide, or n-decyl bromide (1.0 equiv) was added in a dropwise manner
to a heated solution of N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(5.0 equiv) in methanol, and the solution was stirred. The mixture
was then refluxed for 5 h. Next, the solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure, the residue was washed several times with hexane,
and the hexane phase was removed by decantation. Then, the residue
was dried under reduced pressure to obtain N,N-dimethyl-N-[2-(N′,N′-dimethylamino)ethyl]alkylammonium bromide (alkyl
chain length = 4, 6, 8, and 10, respectively) as a yellow or white
viscous solid (Supporting Information:
yields and 1H NMR data).

Synthesis of N,N-Dimethyl-N-[(N′,N′-dimethyl-N′-(alkylammonio)ethyl)]alkylammonium
Dibromide (Cm-2-Cn Br)
First, n-ethyl bromide, n-butyl
bromide, n-hexyl bromide, n-octyl
bromide, or n-decyl bromide (2.0 equiv) was added
in a dropwise manner to a solution of N,N-dimethyl-N-[(N′,N′-dimethylamino)ethyl] alkylammonium bromide (1.0
equiv) in acetonitrile, then the solution was heated under stirring,
and the mixture was refluxed for over 30 h. Next, the solvent was
evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was then washed several
times, first with hexane and then with ethyl acetate, and recrystallized
using a mixture of hexane and ethanol (5:1, vol/vol). The residual
solid was dried under reduced pressure, yielding N,N-dimethyl-N-[(N′,N′-dimethyl-N′-(alkylammonio)ethyl)]alkylammonium
dibromide Cm-2-Cn Br as a white solid (Supporting Information: yields, 1H NMR data, and elemental analysis).

Ion Exchange
of Tetrafluoroborate, Hexafluorophosphate, Trifluoromethanesulfonate,
Bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, and Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide Ions
with Bromide Ion for Cm-2-Cn Br
AgBF4, KPF6, KOTf,
KFSA, or KNTf2 (2.2 equiv) dissolved in water was added
to N,N-dimethyl-N-[(N′,N′-dimethyl-N′-(alkylammonio)ethyl)]alkylammonium
dibromide (1.0 equiv) in water, and the solution was heated under
stirring for over 10 h. The purification procedure for each of the
counterions is described below.

Cm-2-Cn BF4
After the precipitated gray
solid had been
removed by filtration, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure.
For C4-2-C2 BF4, C4-2-C4 BF4, C6-2-C2 BF4, C6-2-C6 BF4, and C8-2-C8 BF4, the residue was washed repeatedly
with hot ethyl acetate, yielding the corresponding compound. For C6-2-C4 BF4, C8-2-C4 BF4, and C8-2-C6 BF4, the residue was dissolved in water and extracted using ethyl acetate.
This procedure was repeated several times, and the ethyl acetate phase
was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the desired compound.

Cm-2-Cn OTf
After the solution had been evaporated under reduced
pressure to remove the solvent, acetone was added to the residue.
The inorganic salt was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was
evaporated. This procedure was repeated twice. Next, the residue was
washed with hot ethyl acetate (in the case of C6-2-C4 OTf, it was washed thrice with water) and recrystallized
using a mixture of hexane and ethanol (7:1, vol/vol).

Cm-2-Cn X (X = PF6, FSA, NTf2)
After the
white solid had been precipitated, the solution was filtered to obtain
the solid. On the other hand, in the case where a viscous material
was formed, the upper-phase solution was removed by decantation to
obtain the viscous material. The residue was washed five times with
water and then dried. Acetone was added to the dried residue, which
was then filtered to remove the inorganic salt, while the solvent
in the filtrate was removed by evaporation. This procedure was repeated
twice. In the case of Cm-2-Cn PF6, the residue was further recrystallized
using methanol and dried under reduced pressure, yielding N,N-dimethyl-N-[(N′,N′-dimethyl-N′-(alkylammonio)ethyl)]alkylammonium [tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate,
trifluoromethanesulfonate, bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, or bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide]
as a white or brown solid as well as a yellow or orange-yellow viscous
material (Supporting Information: yields, 1H NMR data, and elemental analysis).

Synthesis of
Alkyltrimethylammonium Bromide (Cn Br)
First, n-ethyl bromide, n-butyl
bromide, n-hexyl bromide, n-octyl
bromide, or n-decyl bromide (1.0
equiv) was added in a dropwise manner to trimethylamine hydrochloride
(1.5 equiv) dissolved in a methanol solution containing sodium hydroxide.
The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 h and then refluxed
for 5 h under alkaline conditions by adding sodium hydroxide with
thymolphthalein as an indicator. The mixture solution was filtered
to remove the inorganic salt (NaCl), and the solvent in the filtrate
was removed. To the residue was added methanol (alkyl chain length, n = 2, 4, 8, 10) or acetone (n = 6), and
the mixture was filtered to remove the inorganic salt. This procedure
was performed twice. The solvent in the filtrate was removed by evaporation,
and the blue residue was washed several times with hexane and then
ethyl acetate, recrystallized using a mixture of hexane and ethanol
(1:3, vol/vol, for n = 2 and 4; 3:1, vol/vol, for n = 6 and 8; and 3:1, vol/vol; containing a small amount
of methanol for n = 10), and dried under reduced
pressure to obtain alkyltrimethylammonium bromide (Cn Br) as a white solid (Supporting Information: yields, 1H NMR data, and elemental analysis).

Ion Exchange
of Tetrafluoroborate, Hexafluorophosphate, Trifluoromethanesulfonate,
Bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, and Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide Ion
with Bromide Ion for Cn Br
Alkyltrimethylammonium
bromide (1.0 equiv) dissolved in water was added to AgBF4, KPF6, KOTf, KFSA, or KNTf2 (1.1 equiv) dissolved
in water, and the mixture solution was stirred under heating for 10
h. The purification procedure for each counterion is described below.

Cn BF4
After
the precipitated gray solid had been removed by filtration, the solvent
of the filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure, resulting in
a white solid in the cases of C2 BF4, C4 BF4, C8 BF4, and C10 BF4 and a brown viscous material in the case of C6 BF4. The residue was dissolved in methanol for
C2 BF4, C4 BF4, and C6 BF4 and in chloroform for C8 BF4 and C10 BF4. The insoluble inorganic
salt was removed by filtration. This procedure was repeated until
the salt had been removed completely. The solvent in the filtrate
was evaporated; in the cases of C2 BF4, C4 BF4, C8 BF4, and C10 BF4, the residue was washed twice with ethyl acetate.
On the other hand, for C6 BF4, the residue was
dissolved in water, extracted using chloroform, and the chloroform
phase was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the target compound.

Cn OTf
After the solvent
in the filtrate had been evaporated under reduced pressure, acetone
was added to the residue. Next, the inorganic salt was removed by
filtration, and the filtrate was evaporated. This procedure was repeated
twice. Next, the residue was washed with ethyl acetate (in the case
of C2 OTf, it was washed with hot ethyl acetate). For C4 OTf, C6 OTf, C8 OTf, and C10 OTf, dichloromethane was added to the residue. The mixture was filtered
to remove the inorganic salt, and the filtrate was evaporated. This
operation was repeated twice to obtain the target compound.

Cn X (X = PF6, FSA, NTf2)
Once the white solid had precipitated, the solution
was filtered to obtain the solid. On the other hand, in the case where
the solution separated into two phases, the upper phase was removed
by decantation to obtain the liquid. The residue was washed five times
with water and then dried. Acetone was added to the dried residue,
which was then filtered to remove the inorganic salt, and the solvent
in the filtrate was removed by evaporation. This procedure was repeated
twice. In the case of Cn PF6, the residue was recrystallized using methanol and dried under reduced
pressure, yielding alkyltrimethylammonium [tetrafluoroborate, hexafluorophosphate,
trifluoromethanesulfonate, bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide, or bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide]
as a white or brown solid as well as a clear liquid (Supporting Information: yields, 1H NMR data, and
elemental analysis).

In the 1H NMR spectrum, the
chemical shifts of the CH2 peaks of the ethylene spacer
and alkyl chain and peak of CH3 next to the ammonium group
were observed at a high magnetic field upon ion-exchange. Elemental
analysis showed that the errors in the C, H, and N contents of the
compounds were within ±0.3% of their theoretical values. Therefore,
these ionic liquids and compounds are highly pure.

General Methods
The melting points of the amphiphilic
gemini and monomeric compounds were measured using a Shimadzu DSC-50
system (Kyoto, Japan). For the measurements, 2 mg of the compound
in question was placed in a hermetically sealed aluminum pan; the
empty aluminum pan was used as the reference. The measurements were
performed at a heating rate of 0.2 °C min–1 in a nitrogen atmosphere, and the obtained data was corrected and
analyzed using software Shimadzu TA-60WS (Kyoto, Japan). The water
contents of the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic liquids were
determined using a coulometric titration system (Hiranuma AQV-200,
Karl Fischer, Tokyo, Japan). The viscosities were measured at 50 °C
(gemini ionic liquids) and 25 °C (monomeric ionic liquids) using
a Brookfield DV-2T system (Middleborough). The densities were measured
using an Anton-Paar DMA 35 system (Graz, Austria). It should be noted
that the densities of the gemini ionic liquids could not be measured
at 25 °C because of their high melting point.

The electrical
conductivities of the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic liquids
in neat and aqueous solutions were measured using a TOA CM-30R system
(Tokyo, Japan); this was done to determine the conductivities of the
neat ionic liquids and the Krafft temperatures and CMC values of the
ionic liquids in aqueous solutions. The surface tensions of ionic
liquids in neat and aqueous solutions were measured with a Teclis
Tracker tensiometer (Lyon, France) using the pendant drop technique.
The surface excess concentration (Γ/mol m–2) and occupied area per molecule (A) values of the
amphiphilic ionic liquids at the air/water interface were calculated
using the Gibbs adsorption isotherm equations: Γ = −(1/iRT)(dγ/dln C) and A = 1/(NΓ), where γ is the
surface tension, C is the ionic liquid concentration, R is the gas constant (8.31 J K–1 mol–1), T is the absolute temperature,
and N is Avogadro’s constant. The value of i, which is the number of ion species assumed to be completely
dissociated in the aqueous solution, was taken to be 3 and 2, respectively,
for the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic liquids investigated
in this study. The fluorescence of pyrene in the amphiphilic ionic
liquid solutions was measured using a JASCO FP-6300 system (Tokyo,
Japan). The concentration of pyrene in the ionic liquid solutions
was 1 × 10–6 mol dm–3.

The aqueous solutions of the amphiphilic gemini and monomeric ionic
liquids were prepared using water obtained from a Merck KGaA Direct-Q
UV system (resistivity = 18.2 MΩ cm), and the measurements were
performed at 25 °C, with the exception of those for C8-2-C8 FSA, which were performed at 45 °C.
