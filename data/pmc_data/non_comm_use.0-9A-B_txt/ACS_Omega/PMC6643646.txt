A novel “selective surface
dissolution” (SSD) method
was successfully utilized in previous research to prepare “all-polymer
composites” aiming to structural applications. In the current
study, this simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly method
was employed for the first time to synthesize cellulose-derived highly
porous three-dimensional (3D) activated carbon materials to assemble
superior electrodes for supercapacitors. ZnCl2 aqueous
solution was used to partially dissolve the surface of cellulose fibers.
The partially dissolved cellulose I crystalline phase at the fiber
surface can be consolidated into fibrillar cellulose polymorphs (e.g.,
cellulose II) which connects remaining fibers together. By a carefully
controlled SSD method, a highly porous 3D cellulosic skeleton with
interconnected bridge-like fibrillar linkages and hierarchical pore
structures can be created. After carbonization, the 3D fiber construct
with interconnected fibrillar linkages and hierarchical pore structures
remains and highly porous activated carbons were obtained. The effects
of various processing parameters (e.g., solvent concentration, immersion
time, etc.) on the morphology of the as-formed activated porous carbons
and their electrochemical performance as electrodes in supercapacitors
were systematically investigated and discussed. It was concluded that
the SSD method is a promising chemical approach to produce large-scale
cellulose-derived activated porous carbons in an environmentally friendly
manner.

1 Introduction
Emerging environmental
problems and excessive energy consumption
makes cutting-edge research in eco-friendly and efficient energy storage
devices to be urgently needed. Electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC)
also known as supercapacitors are one of the most attractive energy
storage devices for versatile applications such as urban rail transportation,
electrical vehicles, and portable device, thanks to their high power
density, fast charge/discharge rate, and excellent stability features.1 In EDLCs, opposite charges accumulate on the
interfacial regions of electrode and electrolyte by electrostatic
physical interaction, which leads to highly reversible performances
and a long cycle life. Therefore, the surface characteristics of electrode
materials will strongly influence the capacitance of EDLCs.2

Active carbons (ACs) have been widely used
as electrode materials
for EDLCs because of their large surface area, good electrical conductivity,
and relatively lower cost. In recent years, biomass-derived porous
carbon materials have attracted significant attention. As a renewable
resource, biomass shows many advantages, such as an abundant and sustainable
raw materials source, environmental friendliness, and low cost. A
number of inspiring works have been carried out to synthesize porous
carbons from different biomass raw materials for EDLCs.2−15 However, there are still various uncertainties for the utilization
of biomass-derived porous carbons in EDLCs. Besides, harsh alkaline
and heat treatments are often needed to increase surface area of these
carbon materials, which may put more burden on the environment. More
researches have to be performed to develop a simple and environmentally
friendly technique to produce biomass-derived porous carbons.

The concept of “all-polymer composites” or “self-reinforced
composites”, which are based on similar or identical materials
for both matrix and reinforcement, was first brought up in 1970s.16 Since then, this topic has become a fast-growing
research area in polymer composites.17−24 Because of their distinct advantages in lightweight, interfacial
properties, and recyclability, such composites are therefore used
in a wide range of applications, such as automotive, protective materials,
sport products, and so forth. In recent decade, a novel “selective
surface dissolution” (SSD) method has been proposed by Nishino
and Arimoto to prepare eco-friendly “all-cellulose”
composites.25 In their study, the surface
layers of cellulose fibers were selectively dissolved and transferred
into a matrix by consolidation to bond the remaining fiber cores together,
all-cellulose composites were then formed.25 Inspired by this SSD method, a range of all-polymer composites based
on ligno-cellulose, regenerated cellulose, bacterial cellulose and
even aramids have been developed so far, which expands these composites
into high performance applications.26−32

It was noticed in morphological observations that when applying
the SSD method to prepare all-polymer composites, interfibrillar voids
would appear in the later formed matrix phase when solvent immersion
time was not sufficient.27−29 In the case of insufficient immersion
times, interfibrillar voids existing in the matrix phase would lead
to premature failure of the composites. This situation needs to be
much more carefully avoided when preparing all-polymer composites
by the SSD method for structural applications. However, for functional
applications (e.g., as electrodes for EDLCs), porous materials with
high surface area are preferred. Inspired by previous researches on
all-cellulose composites, we suggest that by carefully controlling
the SSD process parameters, the interfibrillar voids together with
remaining fiber cores and as-formed matrix can help to build a beneficial
three-dimensional (3D) porous cellulosic skeleton to further synthesize
highly porous 3D activated carbon materials.

Hence, for the
first time, we propose to apply the SSD method to
synthesize highly porous 3D activated carbons for electrodes in EDLCs.
Zinc chloride (ZnCl2) aqueous solution is widely acknowledged
as a facile, environmentally friendly solvent for cellulose. In this
paper, we utilized ZnCl2 aqueous solution to partially
dissolve the surface of cellulose fibers. The partially dissolved
cellulose I on the fiber surfaces can be consolidated into fibrillar
cellulose polymorphs (e.g., cellulose II), exhibiting a highly porous
3D structure with bridge-like fibrillar linkages that connect remaining
cellulose fiber cores together. After carbonization, a 3D fiber construct
with interconnected fibrillar linkages remains and highly porous activated
carbons were obtained. The effects of various processing parameters
(e.g., solvent concentration, immersion time, etc.) on the morphology
of the as-formed activated porous carbons and their electrochemical
performance as electrodes in EDLCs will be systematically investigated
and discussed in this paper.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Sample Preparation
Filter papers
were first cut into 30 mm × 30 mm squares and immersed into 5,
10, 20, and 40 wt % zinc chloride (ZnCl2) aqueous solutions
for the partial fiber surface dissolution process. The treated filter
papers were then consolidated in water and then dried in an oven at
80 °C for 2 h. In a following carbonization step, the dried samples
were placed in a furnace which was heated to 650 °C at a heating
rate of 5 °C/min under the protection of argon gas, and the samples
were held at 650 °C for 2 h before cooling down to room temperature
naturally to finally obtain black and highly porous carbon materials.
The samples were designated as CF0 (without the SSD process) and CFX-Y, where X represents
solvent concentration and Y represents immersion
time.

2.2 Characterization
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured at 77 K on a Belsorp mini II (BEL Co. Ltd,
Japan). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used
to analyze the surface area (SBET). The
pore size distribution was analyzed using the density function theory
model. Raman spectra were recorded on a Raman spectrometer (Nanophoton,
Japan) at a laser excitation of 532 nm. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was performed on a JSM-6500F (JEOL, Japan) using an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed
on a JSM-2100Plus (JEOL, Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles
were investigated from 5° to 90° at a scan rate of 5°/min
using a MiniFlex600 Rigaku (Japan).

In addition, electrodes
for EDLC were assembled by mixing as-prepared carbon materials (72
wt %) with carbon black (18 wt %) and poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (10
wt %) and then uniformly filtered onto a flexible microporous film.
Electrochemical measurements were carried out in 2032-type coin cells
with these two symmetrical electrodes, with a glass fiber film as
separator, and 1 M H2SO4 as electrolyte. Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) was recorded on a potentiostatic electrochemical
workstation with a two-electrode configuration (VSP-300, Bio-Logic,
France). Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) was performed on CT2110A,
Land Battery Testing System, China.

The specific capacitances
are calculated based on GCD data according
to following eq 1 1  where Ccell [F/g]
is the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor, Celectrode [F/g] is the specific capacitance of single
electrode, ΔV [V] is the potential change within
the discharge time Δt [s], and M [g] is the total mass of active materials on the two electrodes
of the capacitor.

3 Results and Discussion
To analyze the composition and structure of the materials, samples
were characterized by XRD. Before any surface treatment, the diffraction
profile of filter paper in Figure 1a shows a typical cellulose I structure (chains aligned
in a parallel conformation), exhibiting an intense sharp reflection
at 2θ = 22.5° and two overlapping weaker diffractions at
2θ = 14.5° and 16.3°, which are assigned to the [002],
[101], and [101] lattice planes of cellulose I, respectively. Cellulose
I crystalline structure is less stable than cellulose II (an antiparallel
conformation, see Figure 1b), therefore, during the carbonization process of sample
CF0 for example, cellulose I was first transformed into cellulose
II, and the disordered carbon structure formed was based on cellulose
II as indicated by the appearance of broadened and overlapped diffraction
peaks at around 2θ = 22° ([002], [101̅]) and a diffraction
peak at 2θ = 12.5° ([101]) (Figure 1a).

Figure 1 (a) XRD profiles of filter paper and CF0; (b)
chain conformation
of cellulose I and II; (c) XRD diffraction profiles of CF0, CF5-30,
CF10-30, CF20-30, and CF40-30; (d) XRD diffraction profiles of CF10-30,
CF10-60, CF40-30, and CF40-60; (e) XRD diffraction profiles and fitting
curves of CF0 and CF40-30, showing diffraction intensity of [002]
peaks were obviously decreased with increasing solvent concentration.

Figure 1c shows
different XRD diffraction profiles for samples prepared with various
ZnCl2 solution concentrations. All these XRD diffraction
patterns possess three relatively broad peaks around 2θ = 12.5°,
22°, and 44°, which correspond to the [101], [002]/[101̅],
and [100] lattice planes of disordered graphitic carbon. It is also
noticed in Figure 1c that a slight decrease in diffraction intensity occurred for the
[002] plane. To make a clear comparison, XRD diffraction profiles
of CF0 and CF40-30 were plotted separately in Figure 1e. After applying suitable curve fitting,
we can clearly see that the [002] peak intensity decreased for CF40-30,
indicating a decrease in crystallinity with partial surface dissolution.
Lateral crystal size (D) normal to [002] plane can
be calculated by means of Scherrer’s equation 2  where K is a dimensionless
shape factor, λ = 1.5418 Å, β is corrected integral
width, and θ is Bragg angle for the [002] diffraction. Therefore,
lateral crystal size decreases slightly due to an increase of the
integral peak width. Crystallinity in the [002] plane also decreases
with increasing ZnCl2 solvent concentration and more disordered
carbon structures were therefore formed by the SSD process.

We also studied samples treated by relatively low (10 wt %) and
high (40 wt %) solvent concentrations with different immersion times.
As shown in Figure 1d, by increasing immersion times, the diffraction angle slightly
decreased for both low and high solvent concentrations which indicates
a small decrease in crystal size.

In Raman spectra, two characteristic
peaks are present centered
at around 1330 and 1586 cm–1 affiliated with the
D-band and G-band of polycrystalline carbon materials, respectively
(Figure 2). The intensity
ratio between D- and G-bands (i.e., ID/IG) can reflect the graphitic degree
of the carbon materials. As shown in Figure 2, ID/IG of samples increased with higher solvent concentration,
indicating a more defective structure and lower degree of graphitization
created by more cellulose dissolution in ZnCl2 solvent. Table 1 shows ID/IG data for samples with
different immersion times, indicating that more defects are induced
by increasing the immersion time in the SSD process. The “more
defective structure” is attributed to the as-formed porous
cellulosic skeleton with bridge-like fibrillar linkages (i.e., partially
dissolved and consolidated fibrillar cellulose polymorphs) that connect
remaining cellulose fiber cores together.

Figure 2 Raman spectra of CF0,
CF5-30, CF10-30, CF20-30, and CF40-30, indicating
higher ID/IG by increasing ZnCl2 solvent concentration from 5 to 40
wt %.

Different Immersion
Times for Low (10 wt %) and High (40 wt %) Solvent Concentrations
sample	ID/IG	sample	ID/IG	
CF10-30	0.92	CF40-30	0.94	
CF10-60	0.94	CF40-60	0.96	
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms were used to analyze
the micro- and nano-structure of the samples. As shown in Figure 3a, all CF materials
rapidly take up nitrogen at low relative pressures (P/P0 = 0–0.1), displaying typical
IUPAC type I isotherms, indicating that microporosity plays a major
role in these porous structures. Samples from CF5-30 to CF40-30 presents
dramatically higher adsorption uptake at low relative pressure (P/P0) compared with CF0, which
was attributed to the formation of more micro- or meso-pores by the
SSD process at higher solvent concentrations. The pore parameters
of the samples were listed in Table 2. According to Table 2 and the pore size distribution (Figure 3c), micropores (<2 nm) are dominant in
all CF samples, although for samples CF40-30 and CF40-60 larger pores
were created. It is proposed that the ZnCl2 solvent can
substantially dissolve the outer layers of cellulose fibers during
the SSD process. Upon consolidation, dissolved cellulose molecules
reorientated and recrystallized into cellulose II and formed bridge-like
fibrillar linkages that connect the remaining fiber cores together.
Meanwhile, numerous micro- and meso-pores were created inside these
“bridges” during the consolidation process. As indicated
in Table 2, with higher
solvent concentration, both the specific area and volume of micropores
(Smic and Vmic) increased; the specific area and volume of mesopores (Smes and Vmes) increased dramatically
by 1 order of magnitude for samples CF40-30 and CF40-60, which is
also clearly shown in Figure 3c,d. Interestingly, from 5 to 20 wt %, the mean pore size
(Dpore) decreased with higher solvent
concentration due to more fibrillar linkages and micropores created,
but eventually for sample CF40-60, Dpore increased back to the same value as sample CF0. This interesting
phenomena is resulted from the amount of large-sized pores (e.g.,
meso- and macro-pores) increased by higher solvent concentration and
longer immersion time. It is noteworthy that the specific surface
area (SBET) of sample CF40-60 are 4 times
higher than SBET of sample CF0. We also
investigated the porosity of samples with different immersion times
for low (10 wt %) and high (40 wt %) solvent concentrations (Figure 3a,b,d). For low solvent
concentration, with increasing immersion time, SBET and Vtotal increased due to
a continuous formation of fibrillar linkages and micropores. However,
for high solvent concentration, SBET and Vtotal decreased with increasing immersion time.
This can be attributed to the pore amalgamation and closure. The pore
amalgamation and closure happened when a fairly large amount of pristine
cellulose fibers were dissolved and consolidated into linkages between
fiber cores under the circumstances of high solvent concentration
and long immersion time. Similar to the formation of large amount
of matrix phase in all-cellulose composites, during such a massive
dissolution and consolidation process, small-sized pores (e.g., micropores)
amalgamated into large-sized pores (e.g., meso- and macro-pores).
Therefore, the proportion of large-sized pores increased in the samples
CF40-30 and CF40-60 as shown in Figure 3b. Besides, with extended dissolution time, more small-sized
pores closed for sample CF40-60. Hence, both SBET and Vtotal of sample CF40-60
are inferior than those of sample CF40-30. It is also indicated in Figure 3d that pore sizes
in sample CF40-60 are more evenly distributed than in sample CF40-30,
which is the result from pore transformation. The phenomena of pore
transformation can also explain the dramatic increase of Smes and Vmes for sample CF40-30
and the changes of Dpore in Table 2.

isotherms for various
samples; (b) specific surface area (SBET) by BET method for various samples; (c) pore width distributions

times.

It is agreed widely that high specific surface area
and wide pore
size distribution for activated porous carbons would strongly enhance
their electrochemical performance and the performance of EDLCs made
by these carbon materials.2 Therefore,
these cellulose-derived highly porous 3D activated carbons with rich
and hierarchical pore structures are promising candidates for electrodes
in EDLCs.

To visualize the microstructure of as-formed pores
and bridge-like
fibrillar linkages, SEM was performed on samples CF0, CF5-30, CF10-30,
CF20-30, CF40-30, and CF40-60. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, more and stable
bridge-like fibrillar linkages were created by the SSD process with
increasing solvent concentrations. After carbonization, a 3D fiber
construct with interconnected fibrillar linkages well remained and
highly porous activated carbons were obtained. By controlling the
SSD process parameters, more bridge-like fibrillar linkages and micropores
are formed with solvent concentrations from 5 to 20 wt %. With higher
solvent concentration (e.g., 40 wt %), a large number of micropores
are amalgamated into mesopores or macropores, which are in good agreement
with pore parameters in Table 2. Besides, a cross-sectional view of sample CF40-60 is inserted
in Figure 4, showing
large-sized pores underneath the massively dissolved fiber surfaces,
because of the blocking effect of dissolved and consolidated exterior
fiber surfaces. All of the micro-/meso-/macro-pores coexist in the
sample, making the highly porous 3D carbon skeleton a desirable structure
for application in EDLCs.

CF20-30, CF40-30,
and CF40-60. A cross-sectional view of sample CF40-60 is inserted,
showing large pores underneath the massively dissolved fiber surfaces.

showing more bridge-like
fibrillar linkages created by the SSD process.

TEM was utilized to further investigate the existence of
micro-/meso-/macro-pores
created by the SSD process for samples CF40-30 and CF40-60. The grinded
sample powders were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol and dripped
onto a copper mesh. It can be clearly seen in Figure 6 that a highly porous 3D skeleton with hierarchical
pore structures are present in both samples.

Figure 6 TEM images for the samples
CF40-30 and CF40-60.

According to the above results, we propose that a highly
porous
3D cellulosic skeleton can be formed by the SSD process followed by
a consolidation process. After carbonization, the highly porous 3D
skeleton with hierarchical pore structures were well maintained to
finally obtain activated porous carbon materials. A schematic diagram
is demonstrated in Figure 7, revealing how this highly porous 3D skeleton was created
and maintained during the SSD, consolidation, and carbonization processes.

Figure 7 Schematic
diagram showing the formation of activated porous carbons
by SSD, consolidation, and carbonization processes.

We expect that the large surface area and wide
pore size distribution
of this highly porous 3D skeleton with interconnected bridge-like
fibrillar linkages and hierarchical pore structures are beneficial
for supercapacitive performances. Thus, the porous carbon samples
were utilized to assemble two-electrode type EDLC coin cells and their
electrochemical performance was investigated by CV and GCD tests.
As shown in Figure 8a, the CV curves of all of the cells exhibit a near-rectangular shape,
indicating the apparent supercapacitive behavior for these two-electrode
type coin cells. It is noticed that the CV curve of sample CF20-30
shows small redox peaks at around 0.4 V, which is due to the existence
of oxygen-containing active groups on the sample surfaces. At a relatively
high scanning speed, for example, 20–100 mV/s, CV curve of
CF40-30 still shows a good rectangular shape (Figure 8b), indicating the effective electrolyte
accessibility and fast ion transportation within this highly porous
3D structure because of the existence of hierarchical pore structures.

Figure 8 (a) CV
curves for samples without the SSD process (CF0), partially
dissolved by solvents with different concentrations (CF5-30, CF10-30,
CF20-30, and CF40-30), under 20 mV/s scanning speed; (b) CV curves
for sample CF40-30 under different scanning speeds; (c) CV curves
under 20 mV/s scanning speed for samples with different dissolution
times for low solvent concentration (CF10-30 and CF10-60); and (d)
CV curves under 20 mV/s scanning speed for samples with different
dissolution times for high solvent concentration (CF40-30 and CF40-60).

It is also noticed in Figure 8c,d that for low
solvent concentration (e.g., 10 wt
%), the CV curve reveals no apparent changes with increasing immersion
time. However, for high solvent concentration (e.g., 40 wt %), the
area covered by the CV curve increased with increasing immersion time
from 30 to 60 min, indicating a higher capacitance for sample CF40-60.
Recalling the results in Figure 3, sample CF40-60 has a high surface area (1025 m2/g) and a relatively wide and even distribution of pore sizes
between 1 and 4 nm, which may facilitate the ion transportation and
electrolyte accessibility during charging and discharging processes
of the cells. Although sample CF40-30 has an even higher surface area
(1884 m2/g) than sample CF40-60, it exhibits a lower specific
capacitance than sample CF40-60. This can be attributed to the existence
of a large amount of micropores (∼1 nm) in sample CF40-30.
As indicated in Table 2, Vmic of sample CF40-30 is double that
of sample CF40-60. The electrolyte is difficult to access and infiltrate
all of these small pores during charge and discharge process. With
many unemployed micropores existing, the capacitance of sample CF40-30
is therefore lower than the expected value.

On the basis of
this highly porous 3D carbon skeleton with hierarchical
pore structures, CF40-60 demonstrates the highest specific capacity
in the GCD tests, which is in good agreement with the above CV measurements.
A good rate capability makes this carbon material suitable for high
power supercapacitor applications. Furthermore, the sample CF40-60
exhibits a much better rate capability than other samples (see Figure 9). The capacitance
can retain as high as 94.2% when the current density reached 1 A/g,
whereas for CF0 the capacitance dropped significantly to 52.2%. After
5000 cycles, the capacitance of the supercapacitor made with CF40-60
porous carbon materials can have a retention of 75% (Figure 9d).

specific capacity for all of the samples when testing at different
current densities; (c) capacitance retention of all of the samples
when testing at different current densities; and (d) capacitance retention
during cycle tests for CF40-60.

Table 3 summarizes
and compares our results with the specific capacitance of various
activated carbon materials. It clearly shows that the activated porous
carbons prepared by the SSD method are very competitive to other carbon-based
materials. Meanwhile, the preparation procedure reported in this study
is rather simple and environmentally friendly, without the need for
an energy-consuming harsh chemical activation process, which will
make it even more attractive for industry. Therefore, the SSD method
could be a promising way to produce highly porous carbon electrodes
on a large-scale for EDLCs or other energy storage devices.

4 Conclusions
A simple, cost-effective, environmentally friendly SSD method was
employed to prepare cellulose-derived highly porous activated carbons
with a 3D fiber construct, possessing interconnected bridge-like fibrillar
linkages and hierarchical pore structures. This highly porous activated
carbons exhibit large surface areas (1000–2000 m2/g) and a wide pore size distribution which can strongly enhance
the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (EDLCs) based on
these carbon materials. The specific capacitance of EDLCs made with
CF40-60 reaches to 263 F/g, which is nearly 5 times the EDLC made
from untreated CF0. Noticeably, this is 50% higher than commercial
ACs (175 F/g). The capacitance can retain as high as 94% when the
current density increases from 100 mA/g to 1 A/g, whereas for CF0
the capacitance dropped significantly to 52%. After 5000 cycles, the
capacitance of the EDLCs made with CF40-60 porous carbon materials
can have a retention of 75%. In short, it can be concluded that the
SSD method is a promising industrial scalable approach to produce
highly porous activated carbons in an environmentally friendly manner
for the applications in the supercapacitors or other energy storage
devices.
