Selective catalytic oxidation of
carbohydrate-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural,
furfuryl alcohol, and various aromatic and aliphatic compounds to
the corresponding aldehyde is a challenging task. The development
of a sustainable heterogeneous catalyst is crucial in achieving high
selectivity for the desired aldehyde, especially using O2 or air. In this study, a RuO2-supported Mn3O4 catalyst is reported for the selective oxidation reaction.
Treatment of MnO2 molecular sieves with RuCl3 in aqueous formaldehyde solution gives a new type of RuO2-supported Mn3O4 catalyst. Detailed catalyst
characterization using powder X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption,
scanning and transmission electron microscopes, diffuse reflectance
UV–visible spectrometer, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
proves that the RuO2 species are dispersed on the highly
crystalline Mn3O4 surface. This catalytic conversion
process involves molecular oxygen or air (flow, 10 mL/min) as an oxidant.
No external oxidizing reagent, additive, or cocatalyst is required
to carry out this transformation. This oxidation protocol affords
2,5-diformylfuran, 2-formylfuran, and other aromatic and aliphatic
aldehydes in good to excellent yield (70–99%). Moreover, the
catalyst is easily recycled and reused without any loss in the catalytic
activity.

1 Introduction
Acid
catalysts dominate the petrochemical industries, whereas oxidation
catalysts dominate the fine chemical industries.1,2 Acid
catalysts also play important roles in the production of biomass-derived
alternate fuels and fuel additives.3,4 Oxidation process
shares 30% of the total production in the chemical industry.5 Among the key chemicals produced by the oxidation
catalysts, selective production of aldehydes is of significant importance.6 Extensive research is carried out to develop
process for the selective production of aldehyde. Chemical industry
demands a cost-effective but environmental-friendly process for the
production of aldehydes. Even in the development of alternative fuels
and fuel additives, this process plays an important role because a
suitable design of the catalyst can manifest a process for the conversion
of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF).7 However, such processes should adopt sustainable
catalysts and oxidants. In the traditional practice, oxidizing reagents
such as permanganate and dichromate are employed but these stoichiometric
oxidants are expensive and/or toxic.8 Further,
reactions involving these reagents produce heavy-metal-based wastes.
Therefore, the development of catalytic oxidation process using O2/air as an oxidant would be the most benign approach.9−12 To achieve this objective, transition-metal complexes based on copper,
palladium, and ruthenium have been developed.13−15 Metal complex-based
processes are better with respect to green chemistry principles, such
as atom economy, use of eco-friendly oxidizing agents, simplified
reaction process, and so on. However, it is inferior with respect
to catalyst recyclability. Therefore, efforts are being made to develop
sustainable heterogeneous oxidation catalysts for this reaction.

A sustainable and efficient solid catalyst should be able to catalyze
this selective oxidation using O2/air at 1 atm in the absence
of any base.16 RuO2 has been
initially developed for the selective oxidation of alcohols into aldehydes
and ketones.17,18 Further, RuO2-supported
materials have been explored for the selective oxidation of alcohols.19−21 In this direction, one pioneering work is the development of Pd-supported
apatite catalyst which has been successful in the selective oxidation
of alcohols using O2 at atmospheric pressure.22 Later, Pd-, Pt-, Ru-, and Au-based supported
catalysts have been developed.22−25 Supports such as hydrotalcites,23 hydroxyapatites,24 zeolites,21 metal oxides,25 and
carbon26 have been investigated. It is
also possible for metal oxides to selectively catalyze this oxidation.
Certain transition-metal oxides, such as CeO2, have the
capability to oxidize organic molecules by the lattice oxygen. Parent
MnO2 and Mn3O4 catalysts and porous
polymer-supported Mn3O4 catalysts have been
explored for the catalytic oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons and
alcohols.27−29 The reduced form of the oxide, so generated, can
be oxidized back to its original state by utilizing O2 that
is being supplied to the reaction system, thereby, regenerating the
catalyst.30 Therefore, the development
of an oxidation catalyst using such support materials would be highly
interesting.

In recent times, selective oxidation protocol is
applied to produce
a wide range of biomass-derived products, especially DFF. This important
chemical can be produced by the selective oxidation of HMF. DFF can
be used as an important synthetic intermediate for the production
of polymers,31 pharmaceuticals,32 antifungal agents,33 and renewable furan–urea resin.34 Recent literature has witnessed the development of a wide range
of Ru-, V-, Fe-, and Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts for the selective
oxidation of HMF to DFF.35−41

The objective of this study is to develop a versatile catalyst
that has capability to oxidize biomass-derived reactants such as HMF
and furfuryl alcohol to DFF and furfural, respectively, using O2/air. The developed catalyst should also be able to selectively
oxidize a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic alcohols to aldehydes
and ketones. In the present study, RuO2-supported Mn3O4 materials were prepared and investigated in
the selective oxidation using O2/air (1 atm, 10 mL/min).
First, an octahedral MnO2 molecular sieve (OMS) was prepared.
The Ru precursor was added to the OMS, and then, it was treated with
aqueous formaldehyde to form RuO2-loaded Mn3O4. During the aqueous formaldehyde treatment, the OMS
is reduced to Mn3O4 and the Ru precursor is
incorporated as RuO2 on the surface of Mn3O4. Different amounts of RuO2 are loaded on the external
surface of OMS, and the materials are designated as RuO2(x %)/Mn3O4. Among various
catalysts investigated in this study, RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 exhibits better yield for aldehydes and DFF.

2 Results and Discussion
Ruthenium trichloride hydrate,
OMS, and water were mixed and stirred
at ambient temperature. Then, aqueous formaldehyde was added, and
the reaction mixture was heated to 373 K for 30 min. During this period,
Ru was incorporated as RuO2 on the surface of Mn3O4. The details of characterization are provided below.

2.1 Physicochemical Characterization
OMS exhibited a highly
crystalline X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern
with diffraction peaks corresponding to (110), (200), (310), (211),
(301), (411), (600), (002), and (541) planes of OMSs reported in the
literature (ICDD no. 00-29-1020) (Figure 1).42−44 The XRD pattern of ruthenium-incorporated
OMS material was different from the parent OMS. ICDD database match
showed that the diffraction peaks predominantly correspond to Mn3O4 and RuO2 phases. Therefore, this
material was designated as RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4. This result confirmed that during the aqueous formaldehyde
treatment, OMS was reduced to Mn3O4. The reducing
environment was not sufficient to reduce Ru source to Ru nanoparticles,
instead RuO2 was supported on the Mn3O4 surface. The diffractions located at 2θ = 27.9 (110), 34.9
(101), 39.9 (200), 44.8, 54.1 (211), 57.7 (220), 59.4 (002), 65.2
(310), 66.7 (112), 69.3 (301), and 73.9 (202) correspond to the tetragonal
RuO2 (JCPDF: 03-065-2824).45 To further confirm this reduction process, only OMS was treated
with aqueous formaldehyde. The XRD pattern of the resultant material
matched well with the XRD pattern reported for Mn3O4 [2θ = 18.41 (101), 29.27 (112), 31.64 (200), 32.72
(103), 36.52 (211), 38.48 (004), 44.87 (220), 50.23 (204), 51.12 (105),
54.31 (312), 56.21 (303), 58.71 (321), 60.32 (224), 65.01 (400), and
70.05 (305)] (JCPDS no. 18-0803).46 The
XRD patterns of RuO2(2%)/Mn3O4 and
RuO2(1%)/Mn3O4 were similar to that
of the RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 sample (Figure S1).

Figure 1 XRD patterns of OMS, Mn3O4, and RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 prepared
in this study.

Textural properties and
porosity present in the samples OMS, Mn3O4,
and RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 were investigated
using nitrogen adsorption–desorption
measurements (Figure 2). Type-II isotherm was observed for OMS. This isotherm exhibited
a gradual increase in the nitrogen adsorption in the range of 0.2–0.8
(P/P0) followed by a
steep increase in the N2 adsorption above 0.8 (P/P0). This steep increase in
the adsorption volume can be attributed to the adsorption in the intercrystalline
mesoporous–macroporous domain. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution exhibited the distribution of pores in
the range from 2 to 10 nm which was overlapped with the pores from
10 to 100 nm. However, the peak maximum of this overlapped pore size
distribution fell in the mesopore (with peak maxima = 14.5 nm) range.
Mn3O4 and RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 also exhibited type-II isotherm similar to the parent
OMS but with less adsorbed volume. This observation confirmed that
during the reduction process, structural morphology would have changed.
Further, loading of RuO2 was also responsible for the low
adsorption volume. Bimodal pore size distribution was observed from
BJH analysis. A narrow (5–18 nm) pore size distribution is
followed by the mesopore–macropore overlapped domain (20–100
nm). Textural properties obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption
measurements are summarized in Table 1. RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 exhibited
low surface area and pore volume when compared to the parent OMS and
Mn3O4.

size distribution investigated in this study.

The details of surface morphology and microstructure
were investigated
using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). OMS exhibited a highly
cross-linked nanowire-like morphology with a diameter of approximately
20 nm (Figure 3a).
The morphology of Mn3O4 was somewhat different
from the parent OMS morphology (Figure 3b). SEM results confirmed that the aqueous formaldehyde
treatment changed the morphology of parent OMS. Furthermore, an aggregated
nanocrystal morphology was observed for RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 (Figure 3c). The presence of RuCl3 and aqueous formaldehyde
together in the same reaction medium provided distinct morphology
to that of parent OMS or Mn3O4, confirming the
influence of Ru source in the morphological evolution of RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4. An energy-dispersive X-ray analysis
(EDAX) spectrum was recorded for RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 while analyzing the SEM images (Figure S2). Ru, Mn, and O elements were observed in the EDAX
spectrum of RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4.

(c) RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 investigated in

The highly active catalyst,
RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4, was subjected to
transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
investigation to know the in-depth structural information about the
mixed metal oxide composites (Figure 4). Figure 4a,b is the two representative TEM images of low magnification
recorded from two different domains of the same specimen taken during
the TEM analysis. These low-magnification TEM images further confirm
the aggregated morphology obtained during the SEM investigation. The
enlarged view of one such nanocrystal shows the dark domain corresponding
to RuO2 (Figure 4c). High-resolution TEM images captured from two different
regions of the length scale (approximately 100 nm) confirmed the absence
of any nanoparticle-like morphology usually seen for the metal nanoparticles
(Figure 4d,e). Less
distinguishable RuO2 (dark domains) was observed on the
Mn3O4 surface (Figure 4d). Very small size of ruthenium oxide (approximately
1–3 nm) is observed. Further, the high-resolution TEM image
shows fringes with a lattice spacing of 0.47 nm that correspond to
(101) plane of Mn3O4.46 The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained from
the high-magnification image further confirmed the crystalline nature
of the material (Figure 4f). A drift-corrected high-angle angular dark field (HAADF) image
is shown in Figure 5. Elemental mapping obtained from the HAADF image shows the uniform
distribution of various elements in the sample RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 (Figure 5).

The diffuse reflectance
ultraviolet (DRUV)–visible study
provided evidence for the transformation of OMS to Mn3O4 during aqueous formaldehyde treatment (Supporting Information). However, it did not provide convincing
evidence about the oxidation state of Ru present in RuO2/Mn3O4. To study the oxidation states of Ru
and Mn in RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out. Ru, Mn, and O were
observed in the surface XPS profile of RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 (Figure 6a). Ru 3p exhibited two well-resolved doublets corresponding
to Ru 3p1/2 and 3p3/2 located at 484.8 and 462.6
eV, respectively, confirming the formation of RuO2 (Figure 6b).47−49 In the case of Ru0, Ru 3p1/2 and Ru 3p3/2 should have observed at 486.18 and 464 eV, respectively
(Figure 6c).50 Thus, confirming the formation of RuO2 on the external surface of Mn3O4. Further,
two prominent peaks at 281 and 285 eV corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of RuO2, respectively, were observed
in the high-resolution Ru 3d spectrum (Figure 6c).51 It may be
noted that the C 1s peak observed at 284.5 eV was due to the surface
carbonaceous contamination that often overlaps with Ru 3d3/2 (Figure 6c).52 Two weak satellite peaks at 282.2 and 286.9
eV were also observed that correspond to RuO2.53,54 The high-resolution O 1s spectrum demonstrated two different types
of oxygen present in the sample (Figure 6d). The surface hydroxyl group appeared at
a higher binding energy of 532.4 eV was originated due to the physisorbed
or chemisorbed water molecules on metal or metal oxide surface.45 The peak corresponding to binding energy at
530.8 eV was attributed to the O2–/Ru–O bond
reported in literature.37Figure 6e shows the high-resolution
XPS spectrum for Mn 3s. The spin–orbit splitting value (ΔE) between the two doublets was 5.54 eV.55,56 This value was higher than the parent OMS sample (4.60 eV).57 This observation further confirms the change
in the Mn-oxidation state in the Mn3O4 phase
when compared to the parent OMS.56 The
average oxidation state of Mn was calculated using formula AOS = 8.95–1.13 × ΔEs, where ΔEs is the splitting energy of Mn 3s.58 The
average oxidation state of Mn in RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 was calculated to be 2.68 that matched well with the
average oxidation state of Mn in Mn3O4.59 Two well-resolved doublets centered at 653.53
and 641.81 eV corresponding to Mn 2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2, respectively, were observed in the high-resolution XPS spectrum
of Mn 2p, confirming the presence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ species in Mn3O4 (Figure 6f).60 The spin–orbit
splitting value (ΔE) between the two doublets
was 11.74 eV that matched well with the reported value of Mn3O4.60

2.2 Catalytic
Investigation
The aim of
this study was to develop an efficient catalyst for the selective
oxidation of biomass- and nonbiomass-derived reactants to aldehydes.
The detailed study was made for the oxidation of HMF to DFF under
mild reaction condition. The reactant conversion and product selectivity
were confirmed using gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry
(MS) analyses. The product was also confirmed by 1H NMR
analysis (Figure S4). The aim was also
to extend the application of the best catalyst in the selective oxidation
of other aromatic and aliphatic compounds. The reaction condition
was optimized by evaluating various influencing parameters. The details
are systematically described below using HMF as a model substrate.

2.2.1 Influence of the Catalyst
Influence
of the catalyst was investigated in the toluene medium at 363 K for
12 h, by flowing O2 with a flow rate of 10 mL/min (Table 2). It was found that
the reaction did not proceed in the absence of catalyst (Table 2, entry 1). OMS afforded
moderate HMF conversion and produced DFF as the only product (Table 2, entry 2). At the
similar reaction condition, Mn3O4 was also active
and produced moderate HMF conversion with 100% selectivity for DFF
(Table 2, entry 3).
With an aim to improve the catalytic activity, Ru was incorporated
in the catalyst. The process adopted for Ru incorporation led to form
RuO2-loaded Mn3O4 materials. RuO2(1%)/Mn3O4 exhibited improved activity
when compared to the parent OMS and Mn3O4 (Table 2, entry 4). With an
increase in RuO2 loading from 1 to 3%, the DFF yield improved.
However, with further increase in the RuO2 loading to 4%,
the DFF yield marginally decreased (Table 2, entry 9). With the increase in RuO2 loading from 1 to 3% (input), catalytic activity was linearly
increased (Figure S5). With further increase
in RuO2 loading, catalytic activity was marginally decreased.
High dispersion of RuO2 on Mn3O4 support
results into the highly exposed sites for reactants to adsorb and
catalyze the reaction. With further increase in the RuO2 loading, aggregation of RuO2 takes place that results
in the lowering of exposed sites for the reactant to adsorb and catalyze
the reaction. Therefore, catalytic activity was reduced with loading
of large amount of RuO2. This observation was also consistent
with lower surface area and pore volume of RuO2(4%)/Mn3O4 and RuO2(5%)/Mn3O4 when compared to RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4. Therefore, RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 was optimized as the best catalyst for this reaction.

c Catalytic activity data after fifth
cycle. The product was also confirmed from 1H NMR spectroscopy.
Trace amount of benzaldehyde was also obtained as a side product (entries
11–13).

Using this
procedure, the output Ru content was low when compared
to input Ru content (Table 1); therefore, another strategy was adopted to prepare the
catalyst with higher Ru loading. After the formaldehyde treatment
at reflux condition for 30 min, the reaction mixture was dried at
423 K. The resultant solid was washed with water and dried at 373
K for 12 h. The resultant material was subjected to inductively coupled
plasma–atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP–AES) and surface
area measurements. The surface area and pore volume of the resultant
material were found to be 70 m2/g and 0.32 cm3/g. The Ru content was found to be 2.91%. Using this catalyst at
the optimum condition, the HMF conversion of 60.7% and DFF selectivity
of 100% were obtained. On the basis of this experiment, we can say
that even though the Ru content was more in this case, but the activity
was lower to that of the catalyst prepared under the method described
in the Experimental Section. This experiment
confirms that the RuO2 dispersion and the textural properties
of resultant material play key roles in achieving higher activity.

2.2.2 Influence of O2 Pressure
Having
optimized RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 as
the best catalyst, influence of O2 pressure was investigated.
A high-pressure liquid-phase reactor (Parr, USA) was used to carry
out reactions performed at pressure higher than 1 bar. It was interesting
to observe that at any pressure higher than 1 bar, an additional side
product was observed (Table 2, entry 11). This side product was not observed when the reaction
was performed under O2/air flow. The side product was the
dimer of HMF [5,5-oxy-(bismethylene)-2-furaldehyde] which was formed
by the condensation of two HMF molecules. Influence of O2 pressure is shown in Figure 7a. With the increase in the O2 pressure from 2
to 8 bar, HMF conversion was increased but the DFF selectivity was
decreased. It may be noted that using Mn3O4 alone,
at 2 bar O2 pressure, somewhat higher HMF conversion but
lower DFF selectivity was obtained when compared to the reaction performed
under O2 flow (Table 2, compare entries 3 and 12).

(10 mL/min) and (c) O2 pressure (2 bar). Activation energy
calculation by the (d) plot of ln k vs (1/T). Reaction condition: HMF (1 mmol), toluene (8 mL), catalyst
(50 mg), time (12 h).

2.2.3 Influence of Mass Transfer
In order
to investigate the influence of mass transfer, reactions were performed
in a closed pressure reactor under different stirring rates (200,
400, 600, and 800 rpm) for a stipulated time period. Further reactions
were also performed at different stirring rates (300, 500, 700, and
900 rpm) in a round-bottom flask. Under both the conditions, no significant
change in the HMF conversion/DFF selectivity was obtained. These experiments
confirmed that under the optimum reaction condition, mass transfer
had no significant influence on the catalytic activity.

2.2.4 Influence of Temperature
Influence
of temperature was investigated at two different O2 pressures.
Maintaining O2 flow (10 mL/min) constant, the temperature
was increased from 333 to 363 K which resulted in an increase in the
HMF conversion from 22 to 65% (Figure 7b). It may be noted that with further increase in the
temperature, the solvent started evaporating; therefore, the study
was limited up to 363 K. In this temperature range (333–363
K), DFF was the only product. When the same reaction was performed
at 2 bar pressure in the liquid-phase reactor in the temperature range
of 343–393 K, HMF conversion was increased from 43 to 96%,
but the DFF selectivity was reduced from 85 to 79% (Figure 7c). Considering the 100% selectivity
for DFF and influence of pressure and temperature, the kinetic studies
were carried out at different temperatures (333–363 K) with
O2 flow of 10 mL/min. From the Arrhenius plot of ln k versus 1/T, the activation energy Ea was calculated (Figure 7d). The activation energy for this reaction
using RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 as a catalyst
was calculated to be 47.7 kJ/mol.

2.2.5 Influence
of the Solvent
The influence
of the solvent was studied at 363 K under O2 flow (10 mL/min).
Solvent played an important role in obtaining a good yield of DFF.
Less polar and high boiling solvents such as toluene, p-chloro toluene, and xylene afforded higher DFF yield when compared
to high polar and high boiling solvents such as DMSO and DMF. Further,
H2O, 1,4-dioxane, and methyl isobutyl ketone afforded very
low DFF yield (Figure 8a). Considering the economy of the process and higher yield of DFF,
toluene was selected as the optimum solvent for further study. Influence
of solvent suggests that the polar solvents have produced the lower
yield when compared to the nonpolar solvents. Competitive adsorption
of solvent molecules and HMF on the active sites could be the possible
reason for this difference in the activity. Water can be easily adsorbed
on the catalyst site because of hydrogen bonding and provides less
sites for HMF to adsorb; therefore, significantly low yield of DFF
was obtained in H2O. Further, polar solvents have affinity
to be adsorbed on the catalyst sites; therefore, the catalyst exhibited
low activity in the polar solvents. HMF will have preferential adsorption
on the catalyst site when compared to nonpolar solvents (such as toluene);
therefore, more DFF yields were obtained in the nonpolar solvent medium.

of solvents and (b) oxidants investigated in this study.

2.2.6 Influence of the Oxidant
Catalytic
reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure to investigate the
influence of oxidant. Almost similar DFF yields were obtained when
the reactions were performed in O2 flow (10 mL/min) and
O2 (2 bar) (Table 2, compare entries 6 and 11). However, somewhat lower DFF yield
was obtained when the same reaction was carried out using O2-filled balloon (Figure 8b). Also, when the reaction was performed in air at 1 atm
(air-filled balloon), lower DFF yield was obtained (Figure 8b). Further, the reaction using
air flow (10 mL/min) produced lower DFF yield (Table 2, compare entries 6 and 7). When the air
flow rate was increased to 20 mL/min, the DFF yield was almost similar
to the DFF yield obtained using O2 with 10 mL/min flow
rate (Table 2, compare
entries 6 and 8). This shows that even cheaper oxidant such as air
can be used to get good DFF yield. It is interesting to note that
the reaction proceeded well even with H2O2 and tert-butylhydroperoxide. However, these oxidants produced
less yield of DFF when compared to the reaction performed in O2/air flow (10 mL/min). Considering the low cost and easy handling
of O2/air in flow condition, it can be concluded that O2/air would be the best oxidant for this reaction.

2.2.7 Influence of the Substrate
A wide
range of aromatic and aliphatic substrates such as furfuryl alcohol,
5-hydroxymethyl furfural, cinnamyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, cyclohexanol,
allyl alcohol, and 1-octanol were investigated in O2 flow
(10 mL/min) and O2 (2 bar) conditions (Table 3). Moderate yield (60–80%)
was obtained when the reaction was performed for 12 h in O2 flow (10 mL/min). Yield was further improved when the reaction duration
was extended to 18 h. For each of the substrates, except for HMF and
1-octanol, the corresponding partially oxidized product aldehyde was
obtained as the only product under O2 flow and pressure
(2 bar) conditions. When compared to HMF, furfuryl alcohol provided
lower product yield (Table 3, entries 1–2). However, the yield was improved by
performing the reaction at elevated temperature (383 K) at 2 bar pressure
(Table 3, entry 3).
However, at the higher temperature, even in the case of furfuryl alcohol,
dimer was obtained as a minor product. Cinnamyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol,
and cyclohexanol afforded more than 90% yield for aldehyde/ketone
when the reaction was performed at 2 bar (Table 3, entries 4–6). In the case of 1-octanol
in addition to partially oxidized product 1-octanal, fully oxidized
product 1-octanoic acid was also obtained (Table 3, entry 8). Reactivity varies by varying
the substrate. For example, furfuryl alcohol exhibited less activity
when compared to HMF. Furfuryl alcohol and HMF have one common furan
ring in both the substrates. Because of the presence of an active
functional group (−CHO) in HMF, it withdraws electron from
the ring; therefore, the O–H bond becomes weaker; therefore,
oxidant can easily oxidize the carbon bearing O–H bond to aldehyde
group. If one compare the activity difference between entry 4 and
entry 7, the mesomeric effect of phenyl group (−M effect) in
cinnamyl alcohol withdraws the electron density from O–H via
extended conjugation, thereby weakening the O–H bond. Thus,
oxidant can facilitate the oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde
readily when compared to allyl alcohol. Similar effect was observed
for benzyl alcohol (entry 5). It is well known that ketone is more
stable than aldehyde. Aldehyde has the tendency to oxidize further
to form acid; therefore, in the case of 1-octanol, octanoic acid is
obtained as a side product. However, in cyclohexanol oxidation (2°
alcohol), alpha C–H is more susceptible for oxidation because
of the strain effect when compared to long alkyl C–H bond of
1-octanol; therefore, higher yield of cyclohexanone was obtained.

2.2.8 Proposed Mechanism for Partial Oxidation
Table 2 demonstrates
that the oxidation took place even with parent OMS and Mn3O4. However, RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 exhibited better activity than Mn3O4. It suggests
that two sites (RuO2 and Mn3O4) are
playing independently/cooperatively in the oxidation reaction. Mn3O4 is a spinel structure which is composed of both
[Mn2+] and [Mn3+]. Similarly, OMS contains [Mn4+] and [Mn3+]. Mn4+/Mn3+ oxidizes
the HMF to DFF using lattice oxygen present in Mn3O4/OMS, and in this process, reduction of Mn4+/Mn3+ to Mn3+/Mn2+ takes place (Scheme 1a). Molecular O2 present in the reaction system reoxidizes Mn3+/Mn2+ to Mn4+/Mn3+ followed by replenishment
of consumed lattice oxygen (oxygen vacancy) (Scheme 1a).61 RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 has adsorbed water molecules
that provide Ru–OH sites at the catalyst surface for the adsorption
of HMF molecules through the hydroxyl group of HMF (Scheme 1b).20 Under the reaction condition, dehydration takes place and Ru surface
bound to HMF is formed as an intermediate (I). It undergoes intramolecular
cyclization to afford 2,5-diformyl furan (DFF) and generates ruthenium
hydride species (II). Molecular O2 present in the reaction
system oxidizes the ruthenium hydride species to ruthenium peroxide
intermediate (III) and finally completes the cycle and regenerates
the catalyst. High pressure and temperature facilitate the self-condensation
of HMF molecules to form the dimer (Scheme 1b) as a side product.

2.2.9 Catalyst
Recyclability
Recyclability
of the catalyst RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 was
investigated in the oxidation of HMF to DFF at two different O2 pressures. First, the reaction was carried out using HMF
(1 mmol), toluene (8 mL), temperature (373 K), time (12 h), O2 flow (10 mL/min), and catalyst (50 mg). After the first use,
the catalyst was separated from the reaction mixture using a centrifuge
machine. The recovered catalyst was washed with toluene and dried
in an oven at 373 K for 10 h for the next cycle. Recycling study shows
no significant decrease in the activity even after five cycles (Figure 9a). Furthermore,
when the reaction was carried out at 2 bar O2 pressure,
after fifth cycle, DFF yield of 63.4% was obtained (Figure 9b). XRD (Figure S6), SEM (Figure S7), and
textural properties (Table 1) confirm that the catalyst was stable after the recycling
experiments. Elemental analysis was performed for the recovered catalysts
after performing the reaction for five cycles at 2 bar O2 pressure and O2 flow (1 atm). Amount of Ru in the recovered
catalysts was found to be 2.28 and 2.32 wt %. To further confirm the
metal leaching, a hot filtration test was performed. Reaction was
conducted for 4 h under O2 flow (1 atm). The reaction was
stopped, and the catalyst was removed using a centrifuge machine.
A small aliquot of reaction mixture was withdrawn and analyzed by
GC. HMF conversion and DFF selectivity were 28.4 and 100%, respectively.
Reaction was further continued in the absence of catalyst for remaining
8 h in O2 flow. After 12 h of the reaction, HMF conversion
and DFF selectivity were 28.7 and 100%, respectively. The hot filtration
experiment confirmed that active species were not leached; therefore,
no increase in HMF conversion was observed. Elemental analysis was
performed for the reaction mixture obtained after 12 h. Ru and Mn
species were not detected which confirmed that Ru and Mn were not
leached into the solution and those Ru/Mn sites which were present
in the catalyst catalyzed the reaction as a heterogeneous catalyst
to produce the desired product.

Comparative catalytic
activity data suggest that the present catalyst
demonstrated better activity (compare TOF) than various reported ruthenium-based
catalysts under mild reaction condition for the conversion of HMF
to DFF (Table S1).7,35,61−64 In some cases, although the yield
of DFF/TOF is high, however, the catalyst synthesis procedure is complicated
and the reactions were performed at higher temperature and pressure.7,35,61−64

3 Conclusions
In this work, a facile and sustainable conversion of biomass-derived
HMF and nonbiomass-derived alcohols to aldehydes under mild reaction
condition was demonstrated. This conversion was achieved using a RuO2-supported Mn3O4-based catalyst. The
catalyst was prepared by the reaction of octahedral molecular sieve
MnO2, RuCl3, and aqueous formaldehyde. At reflux
temperature, MnO2 was reduced to Mn3O4 but Ru metal nanoparticles were not formed. TEM study confirmed
that small RuO2 particles were uniformly distributed over
the external surface of Mn3O4. XRD and XPS analyses
further confirmed that RuO2 and Mn3O4 were formed. RuO2-supported Mn3O4 offered an extremely simple and highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst
system for the oxidation of alcohols using oxygen/air. This sustainable
catalytic oxidation process did not involve any additives and cocatalysts
that make it an ideal environmentally benign chemical process for
potential industrial application. This catalytic oxidation was facilitated
by the Mn2+/Mn3+ sites of Mn3O4 support along with RuO2 sites present in the nanocomposite
catalyst. Among the catalysts investigated in this study, RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 exhibited the best catalytic
activity under O2/air flow condition and afforded 100%
selectivity for the aldehyde product in good to excellent yield for
a wide range of important chemicals including DFF, 2-formylfuran,
benzaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, and so forth. The catalyst was recycled,
and no appreciable loss in the catalytic activity was observed even
after five cycles. The use of sustainable oxidant such as molecular
O2/air (10 mL/min) and facile and easy recovery of catalyst
and the desired product from the reaction mixture make the process
economically viable. Efforts are in progress in our laboratory to
make more efficient catalyst system for the direct transformation
of biomass-derived carbohydrates to DFF and other value-added fine
chemicals and fuels.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material and Methods
Potassium permanganate
(99%), manganese sulfate monohydrate (98%), and urea (98%) were purchased
from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. Mumbai, India. Ruthenium trichloride hydrate
(RuCl3·nH2O, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich),
nitric acid (SD Fine, 69%), and aqueous formaldehyde (37%, SD Fine
Chemical Ltd. India.) were used as such without any purification.
Solvents and other reagents used in the synthesis and catalysis were
procured from Merck, India Limited.

4.2 Catalyst
Synthesis
OMS was prepared
by following the reported procedure.42 Different
amounts of RuO2 were supported, and the resultant materials
are designated as RuO2(x %)/Mn3O4, where x = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. For
illustration, the procedure for the synthesis of RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 is described as follows. RuCl3·nH2O (30.8 mg) was dissolved in deionized water
(50 mL) in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. After complete dissolution,
540 mg of OMS was added to the above dark black solution and allowed
to stir overnight (8–10 h) under ambient temperature. Then,
4.8 mL of reducing agent (aqueous formaldehyde, 2.5 mM) was added,
and stirring was continued for additional 20 min at ambient temperature.
Finally, the resulting mixture was heated at 373 K for 30 min. During
reflux, the color of the reaction mixture changed from dark black
to brown. After cooling to ambient temperature, the resulting mixture
was centrifuged, washed thoroughly with deionized water 2–3
times, and dried at 373 K for 12 h. Ru contents in RuO2(3%)/Mn3O4 were estimated from ICP–AES
(Table 1). Though the
aim was to support Ru on the external surface of OMS, but the synthesis
procedure adopted in this study provided RuO2 supported
on Mn3O4. Physicochemical characterization discussed
below confirmed the formation of RuO2-supported Mn3O4 nanocomposites.

4.3 Procedure
of Catalytic Reaction
Catalytic
reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure by flowing oxygen/air
during the reaction. For example, HMF (1 mmol), catalyst (50 mg),
and 8 mL of toluene were added into a 25 mL double-necked round-bottomed
flask and stirred at 363 K for 12 h. During the reaction, O2/air was charged at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. After performing the
reaction at desired time period, the reaction was stopped and the
flask was cooled to ambient temperature. The catalyst was removed
using centrifuge machine, and the reaction mixture was analyzed using
GC (Yonglin 6100; BP-5; 30 m × 0.25 μm × 0.25 μm).
The products of the reaction were confirmed using GC–MS (Shimadzu
GCMS-QP 2010 Ultra; Rtx-5 Sil Ms; 30 m × 0.25 μm ×
0.25 μm) and 1H NMR (400 MHz, JEOL). Various products
synthesized in this study are commercially available. They were procured
from Merck, India. Standard mixtures of these compounds were prepared
and analyzed by GC. Calibration curves were constructed by plotting
the concentration and area under the peak obtained from the GC analysis
(Standard addition method). The conversion was determined based on
the results obtained from the GC analysis and calibration curves.
Each sample was measured three times, and the standard deviation was
calculated. The standard deviation was in the range of 0 to ±2.0
(more precisely in the range of ±0.2 to ±1.6). The average
values (to the nearest integer) are provided in tables and Figures 7–9.

Furthermore, these reactions were also performed
at elevated pressures in a liquid-phase pressure reactor (100 mL Parr
Reactor). HMF (1 mmol), catalyst (50 mg), and 8 mL of toluene were
charged into the reactor. The reactor was pressurized with different
O2 pressures (2, 4, 6, and 8 bar), and all of these reactions
were conducted at 363 K for 12 h.
