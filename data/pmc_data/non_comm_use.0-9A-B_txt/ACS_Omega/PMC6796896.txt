Tau is an axonal protein known to
form abnormal aggregates and
is the biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease. Metal-based therapeutics
for inhibition of Tau aggregation is limited and rarely reported in
contemporary science. Here, we report the first example of rationally
designed molecular cobalt(II)-complexes for effective inhibition of
Tau and disaggregation of preformed Tau fibrils. The mechanistic studies
reveal that prevention of Tau aggregation by cobalt-based metal complexes
(CBMCs) is concentration-dependent and Tau seldom exhibits conformational
changes. Interestingly, CBMCs play dual role in causing disassembly
of preformed aggregates as well as inhibition of complete Tau aggregation.
Furthermore, CBMCs were nontoxic and maintained the tubulin network
intact. CBMCs also prevented okadaic acid-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y
cells thus, preventing hyperphosphorylation of Tau. We believe that
this unprecedented finding by the newly developed molecular complexes
has a potential toward metal-based therapeutics for Alzheimer’s
disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by progressive cognitive and behavioral impairment.
Worldwide, 44 million people are known to have AD and its related
dementia; moreover the available therapeutic aid to overcome AD is
limited.1,2 Abnormal protein deposits in the brain,
such as extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary
tangles (NFTs), characterize AD. The microtubuleassociated protein
Tau, plays a key role in several neurodegenerative diseases-like AD,
frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism-17 and Parkinson’s
disease and so forth.3 The axonal Tau is
expressed in an adult human brain as six different isoforms. Because
of alternative splicing, two N-terminal inserts and the second repeat
(R2) in the C-terminal MT-binding domain can be present or absent
(Figure 1A). Upon hyperphosphorylation,
Tau disassembles from MTs and self-assembles to form NFTs which consist
of paired helical filaments (PHFs).4 Several
factors are responsible that trigger the PHF formation under pathological
conditions, such as post-translational modifications, oxidative stress,
truncation, and metal ions and so forth.5,6 Molecules derived
from metal complexes, natural products, and peptides were screened
for inhibition of Tau aggregation or to disaggregate the preformed
fibrils of Tau.7,8 Recently, methylene blue was identified
as an inhibitor of Tau aggregation and subjected to phase III clinical
trials.9 Indeed, there is a strong need
for the discovery of new potential therapeutics.10,11 In this regard, significant research is being devoted in recent
times to identify active compounds12−15 with novel scaffolds that may
have potential properties for the treatment of AD by inhibiting Tau
aggregation.16,17

Figure 1 (A) Domain organization of full-length
Tau. The longest isoform
of Tau is composed of 441 amino acids, with four repeats toward the
C-terminal that is crucial in both physiological processes and in
AD pathology. In physiological conditions, it interacts with the tubulin
dimer and helps in the assembly of MTs; whereas in pathological conditions
they act as main nucleating centers and form the core of aggregates.
The four repeats, R1–R4 comprises hexapeptides at the beginning
of R2 and R3 which are signature motifs responsible for Tau aggregation.

The importance of different metals in AD is well studied, which
elucidates the critical role of metal ions in pathology.18 Metal ions are mostly involved in the physiological
functions and are also known to interact with proteins, leading to
their aggregation.19,20 Metal ions such as copper(II),
zinc(II), iron(III), and aluminium(III) are well studied for their
protein aggregation properties. It was reported that copper and zinc
interact with amyloid-β and promote their aggregation.21,22 The mode of binding of these metal complexes with amyloid-β
was studied by Raman spectroscopy and the results revealed importance
of the three histidines present at the N-terminus. Later, the role
of iron(III) in aggregation of amyloid-β was studied by NMR
experiments, which demonstrated the importance of first 16 amino acids
in the formation of iron coordination.23 The interaction of copper(II) with Tau was analyzed by NMR. The
amino acid sequences adjacent to the hexapeptide motif in the second
and third repeat of Tau were involved in interacting with copper.
Copper bound to Tau via oxidized cysteine residues caused aggregation
of Tau.24 In an AD brain, Tau hyperphosphorylates
and aggregates to form PHFs, aluminium(III) ions specifically interact
with these phosphorylated epitopes.25 These
findings suggest that phosphorylated Tau is triggered for aggregation
in the presence of aluminium(III). Further, the effect of aluminium
maltolate administration was reported for neurodegeneration in rabbits.26 However, the effect of zinc(II) on Tau fibrillization
under physiological conditions was contradicting to that of copper(II)
and aluminium(III). The lower levels of zinc(II) would enhance Tau
aggregation by decreasing the expression of Tau or by reducing the
ability of Tau to interact with MTs. Sequestration of zinc(II) by
extracellular senile plaques led to decreased intracellular zinc levels,
which ultimately elevated NFT formation. Importantly, the presence
of higher intracellular zinc levels led to hyperphosphorylation of
Tau at S214, which eventually resulted in aggregates.27 Furthermore, ferric iron led to Tau aggregation in vitro,
and its reduced form caused hyperphosphorylation of Tau.28,29

In the present studies, we screened the effect of rationally
designed
molecular cobalt-based metal complexes (CBMCs; Figure 1B and Chart 1) on Tau aggregation and found that these complexes are effective
in preventing the formation of a toxic population of Tau. The CBMCs
were effective in inhibiting the polymerization of Tau in a concentration-dependent
manner. The efficacy of these metal complexes was analyzed by fluorescence
assay and the morphology of aggregates was observed by microscopic
analysis. The conformational changes in Tau were analyzed using spectroscopic
techniques and the toxicity studies were performed in neuronal cells.
The nontoxic nature of CBMCs and their ability to maintain tubulin
networks suggests the lead role of these complexes. CBMCs effectively
protected SH-SY5Y cells from okadaic acid (OA)-induced toxicity, which
supports them as a potent molecule for AD.

Results and Discussion
CBMCs,
As a Barrier for Tau Aggregation
Tau protein
is one of the major MT-associated proteins in neuronal axons that
mainly functions to stabilize and assemble MTs.30 Tau is a soluble protein, and adopts natively unfolded
structure in solution.31 The repeat domains
of Tau and the flanking proline-rich regions confer the properties
of MT binding and assembly (Figure 1A). The repeat domains of Tau represents the core of
PHFs and the hexapeptide motifs in repeat 2 and 3 form the basic motif
for aggregation.32 Under in vitro conditions,
heparin is used as an inducer to enhance Tau aggregation.32 Heparin binds to the positively charged residues
of the flanking repeats 2 and 3, and thus leading to charge neutralization.
Further, the binding of heparin also induces a change in the conformation
to
β-sheet, which serves as a nucleation center for aggregation.
In our present study, Tau protein was diluted in assembly buffer,
incubated for the formation of aggregates in the presence or absence
of CBMCs and the extent of aggregates formation was monitored by ThS
fluorophore. Our interest in metal-based therapeutics in AD began
with the discovery of novel Co(II) complexes. Cobalt is relatively abundant and
biorelevant, which leads us to find its therapeutics in AD.33 The reaction of the tridentate ligand with CoCl2 in methanol at 65 °C incubated for 4 h resulted in the
corresponding cobalt-pincer complexes with an excellent yield (see Figures S1–S7). All the complexes were
well characterized and the structure of NNN-L2 CoCl2 was
confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study (Figure 1C). The Co(II)-complexes (CBMCs)
were incubated with a constant Tau concentration of 0.91 mg mL–1, with increasing concentrations of metal complexes
(0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg mL–1). The aggregation
of full-length Tau with CBMCs at higher concentration substantially
decreased the ThS fluorescence (Figure 2A–C), which indicates the prevention of aggregate
formation. Further, we have quantified inhibition, which revealed
that L2 is more potent with 92.5% inhibition at lowest concentrations
of 0.025 mg mL–1, whereas, L3 and L1 showed 85.5
and 73.9% inhibition, respectively. Similar observations were obtained
with CoCl2, where Tau aggregation inhibition was observed
and the quantification of ThS fluorescence at the end of the assay
that is 72 h, indicated about 79 to 82% inhibition (Figure S17A,B). At the highest concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1, they showed up to 93% inhibition (Figure 2D). The higher order species
formed upon Tau aggregation were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis (Figure 2E–G). At 0 h, higher order aggregates
are observed by SDS-PAGE, which was not comparable with ThS. These
early oligomers induced by these complexes were consistently observed
in two sets of experiments and being SDS-stable they are observed
by SDS-PAGE but not by ThS fluorescence. In the presence of metal
complexes at higher concentrations the higher order aggregates faded
away over the time. These data were in agreement with size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC) analysis, which was evidenced by the retention
volume (Figure S12A–D).

Figure 2 Cobalt-based
complexes inhibit Tau aggregation. (A–C) The
aggregation inhibition of full-length Tau in the presence of CBMCs
monitored by ThS fluorescence. The aggregation was induced from full-length
Tau in the presence of heparin as inducer and assembly buffer. The
typical full-length Tau reaches its highest propensity of aggregation,
but the incorporation of the cobalt complex completely decreases its
aggregation with increasing concentration of metal complexes. (D)
Although all the three complexes are compelling in the inhibiting
aggregation process, the lower concentration of L2 is more effective
in comparison with L1 and L3. At higher concentrations of 0.05 and
0.1 mg mL–1 L2 and L3 show maximum inhibition of
about 97%. L1 at its highest concentration of 0.1 mg mL–1 has an inhibition of 97%, which clearly suggests the proficiency
of these metal complexes in inhibiting Tau aggregation. (E) Tau was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE at 0 h, where the higher order species were observed
in the highest concentration of CBMCs. (F) The higher order species
were reduced at 24 h. (G) When Tau was further analyzed at 72 h these
higher order species completely faded away.

Native Conformation of Tau Maintained by CBMCs
The
changes in Tau conformation due to metal complexes were studied by
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Tau has no secondary structure
and exists as a random coil protein and shows an absorbance at around
190 nm. The aggregated full-length Tau shows few nanometers shift
towards the higher wavelength, which signifies the transition of the
random coil to β-sheet conformation.34,35 Similarly, the control Tau (red line) exhibits a shift in the wavelength
indicating β-sheet conformation. On the other hand the soluble
Tau (black line) wavelength falls below 200 nm, indicating random
coil conformation. In the presence of CBMCs, the typical random coil
conformation of full-length Tau was not altered (Figure 3A–C), signifying the
effect of these complexes in preventing aggregate formation. Tau protein
in in vitro forms fibrillar morphology in the presence of heparin,
which was observed as a long filamentous structure. The extent of
aggregate formation by Tau in the presence of L1, L2, and L3 were
studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which discloses
the vigor of CBMCs in completely preventing Tau aggregation (Figure 3D–G). Further,
the energy dispersive X-ray revealed a negligible amount of CBMCs
to be associated with Tau, which denotes that Tau was devoid of conjugation
with CBMCs (data not shown). X-ray photon electron spectroscopy analysis
showed that the oxidation state of CBMCs remains unchanged during
Tau aggregation (data not shown). CBMCs formed higher order Tau aggregates
at 0 h, which led us to study its role in interaction with soluble
Tau. However, surprisingly no higher order aggregates were observed
upon incubation at 37 °C (Figure S9A) and this manifested the inability of complexes to form toxic Tau
species, when compared to the control (Figure S9B). The initial Tau conformation plays a critical role in
order to form the nucleating species, which further accelerates the
formation of aggregates. Here, we showed that these molecular Co(II)-complexes
did not induce conformational changes in monomer Tau and maintained
its native conformation (Figure S10A–C). To support the data, we further studied the effect of CBMCs on
monomer full-length Tau (Figure S11A–C) for their aggregation. Tau aggregates were not observed, which
suggest that Co(II)-complexes did not lead to the formation of aggregates
during the initial stages of Tau assembly.

Tau measured by CD spectroscopy. (A–C)
The full-length Tau in the native state unveils its random coil conformation,
but upon aggregation it attains β-sheet conformation, represented
in red. On addition of CBMCs in increasing concentrations of 0.01
and 0.1 mg mL–1 Tau exhibits random coil conformation,
indicating the effective role of CBMCs in preventing β-sheet
formation by Tau and thus, preventing its aggregation. (D) The morphology
of Tau upon incubation with an inducer alone and the typical morphology
of Tau fibrils were observed. (E–G) The presence of CBMCs stipulated
their ability to prevent aggregate formation. The insets in each micrograph
represent the morphology of Tau aggregates at a magnification of 0.5
μm.

Destabilization of Preformed
Tau Fibrils
We further
investigated the role of CBMCs in the disassembly of Tau PHFs. This
would illustrate both the properties of aggregation inhibition and
disaggregation of Tau. The preformed Tau aggregates were incubated
with various concentrations of L1, L2, and L3; it was observed that
L3 was more effective in disaggregating Tau, when compared to L1 and
L2 (Figure 4A–C).
At a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1, L3 showed about
77.4% of inhibition but, L1 and L2 showed 73.5 and 71.9% inhibition,
respectively (Figure 4D). Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis showed decrease in aggregates
by CBMCs in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4E–G). Unlike ThS fluorescence, SDS-PAGE
did not show a decrease in the intensity of higher order aggregates
of Tau. However, at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL–1, L3 exhibited a decrease in Tau aggregates, whereas L3 showed a
decrease in aggregates formation at 24 h. At 120 h of incubation,
CBMCs effectively disintegrated the Tau aggregates as ascertained
by the lower intensity of higher molecular weight (around 250 kDa)
Tau (indicated by red arrow). Initially, at 0 h of incubation, no
changes were observed in the morphology of aggregates in the presence
of CBMCs (Figure S8B–D), when compared
to untreated Tau aggregates (Figure S8A). However, at the end of 120 h, there was a definite decrease in
the formation of PHFs (Figure 6A–D). Overall, these results suggest that the efficacy
of CBMCs in preventing formation of Tau aggregates that could be toxic
and hence, can be a potent therapeutic agent against AD.

Figure 4 CBMCs disintegrate
full-length Tau aggregates. (A–C) The
effect of disaggregation by L1, L2, and L3 conjugated to CoCl2 was analyzed by ThS fluorescence assay. Tau aggregates were
incubated with CBMCs in an increasing concentration of 0.01–0.5
mg mL–1. (D) It was observed that the highest concentration
of L1 showed 73.5% disaggregation, whereas L2 and L3 showed 71.9 and
77.4% disaggregation, respectively. (E–G) The presence of higher
order aggregates were monitored by SDS-PAGE at different time points
of incubation, at 0 (E) 24 (F) and 120 h (G) where L3 was more efficient
amongst the three in disintegrating Tau aggregates.

In recent years, several drugs failed in the clinical trials,
which
emphasize the need to develop and screen natural as well as synthetic
molecules to target AD pathology. Although AD has multifaceted effectors
like kinases, proteases, oxidative stress, and so forth, the structure
of protein plays an important role in the interaction, and further
change in its conformation can lead to either oligomers or aggregates
formation. The oligomeric precursors are substantially more toxic
than Tau fibers. The amyloid fibrils are likely to play an important
role, either as reservoirs or sinks to toxic oligomers. Hence, a detailed
screening of the compounds could help in discovering potential drugs
that prevent protein aggregation in AD. The role of metal ions in
interacting with proteins and leading to their aggregation is a well-known
phenomenon.36 Metal ions such as copper(II),
zinc(II), aluminium(III), and iron(III) cause protein aggregation,
but our results suggested that molecular cobalt(II) complexes have
a paradoxical effect. Previously, Rajendran et al., have reported
the deposition of metals such as iron, copper, and zinc in the AD
brain, which revealed increased metal accumulation in comparison with
healthy brain tissue.37 Aluminium is known
to play a key role in the accumulation of Tau in cultured neurons
and AD pathology.38 Animal studies revealed
that injecting PHFs with and without aluminium salts led to distinct
effects. Aluminium salts caused the deposition of amyloid-β
and several other proteins along with Tau.39 Moreover, the in vitro studies showed that aluminium formed higher
order aggregates, as examined by SDS-PAGE. Aluminium caused aggregation
in phosphorylated Tau. Aluminium affects Tau aggregation by reducing
the activity of protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), an enzyme essential
for dephosphorylation of Tau; and activating kinases such as cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (cdk5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β).40,41 Kawahara et al., showed that prolonged exposure to aluminium led
to conformational changes in amyloid-β and its aggregation.42

In our present observations, the biochemical
studies revealed that
potency of CBMCs in preventing Tau polymerization. Copper interacts
with both Tau and amyloid-β, driving AD pathology. The oxidative
properties of copper leading to Tau aggregation via cysteine residues
is well understood.24 Studies in 3XTg-AD
mice showed that treatment with copper led to the activation of cdk5/p25
which caused hyperphosphorylation of Tau.43 Voss et al., elucidated that copper led to hyperphosphorylation
of Tau in SH-SY5Y cells, in an amyloid-β-independent manner.44 Copper was also known for reactive oxygen species
production in the presence of amyloid-β, leading to cytotoxicity.45,46 Copper interacted with amyloid-β and reduced the content of
β-sheet conformation that further formed amorphous aggregates.47 In our current studies, CBMCs did not drive
conformational changes in full-length Tau. The monomer Tau manifested
the signature of typical random-coil conformation in the presence
of metal complexes, which indicated that CBMCs did not drive conformational
changes in Tau. Tau usually accumulates to form filamentous aggregates,
but aluminium led to the formation of amorphous aggregates.48 Complementary to CD spectroscopy of soluble
Tau, TEM analysis also suggested the absence of toxic Tau species.
The SEC analysis clearly indicated that the higher order species of
Tau aggregates were prevented by CBMCs (Figure S12).

Direct Interaction of CBMCs with Tau
Isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) is the direct method to obtain free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH), and entropy (ΔS) changes along with dissociation constant (KD) and number of binding sites (N) for
ligands on the protein. Soragni et al., and Zhu et al., in individual
studies, employed ITC to analyze the binding of copper and lead, respectively.24,34 The ITC titration yielded differential power values during interaction
of Tau with L2 (Figure 5A). These values were integrated to obtain exothermic peaks (Figure 5B). The negative
ΔG value, −7.41 revealed the spontaneity
of binding. The titration suggested binding of L2 to Tau with a dissociation
constant (KD) of 6.03 ± 2.35 μM,
a weak interaction. The fitting by one set of sites resulted in the N value of 0.403 ± 0.057. The binding indicated small
enthalpy changes (ΔH) with a negative entropy
of −0.654 ± 0.226 and −4.47 kcal/mol, respectively.
L2 was also titrated with N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic
acid (BES) buffer alone to obtain the isotherm, which suggested that
L2 exhibited less heat changes when compared to the heat changes measured
as shown in Figure 5 (Figure S15).

Figure 5 Isothermal titration
microcalorimetric analysis for CBMCs binding
to Tau. (A) The differential power in terms of μcal/s was plotted
for each injections of L2. (B) The raw data was integrated as kcal/mol
of injection vs the molar ratio of ligand, L2. The fitting of integrated
points using one set of sites revealed the interaction of L2 with
Tau, with a KD of 6.03 ± 2.35 μM.
The N value of 0.403 ± 0.057 suggests binding
of one L2 to two Tau molecules.

Tau-Mediated Cytotoxic Studies of CBMCs in SH-SY5Y
Metals
are essential components of the brain at physiological levels
but their accumulation at higher concentration would be detrimental.
Metals are known to exert toxicity in either of the following ways,
by inhibiting PP2A or activating kinases such as cdk5/p25, GSK3β,
and so forth. The neurons isolated from the hippocampus were treated
with iron, this led to oxidative stress, which ultimately caused Tau
hyperphosphorylation via the cdk5/p25 complex.49 Similarly, studies in rat primary cortical neurons showed
that zinc caused phosphorylation of Tau at Ser262, which was marked
as an early pathological event in AD.50 Hence, the toxicity of these compounds was analyzed by treating
SH-SY5Y cells with CBMCs. As shown in Figure 6E, maximum toxicity
was observed with 100 μg mL–1 of the compounds
used. SH-SY5Y cells treated with 5 μM Tau aggregates alone showed
59% cell toxicity. However, this toxicity was arrested in the presence
of CBMCs up to 50% (Figure 6F) at lower doses suggesting the potential role of CBMCs to
rescue the cells from Tau-induced cytotoxicity even at much lower
concentrations. The cell morphology of SH-SY5Y in the absence of CBMCs
or Tau aggregates, that is, cell control showed extended neurite outgrowths
(Figure 6G,H). The
cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle exhibited no
toxicity, indicating that the vehicle had no role in inducing toxicity
to the cells. Further the cell morphology was lost at 100 μg
mL–1 of L3. L1 and L2 showed moderate toxicity at
this concentration.

Figure 6 Disaggregation of Tau PHFs by CBMCs. (A) Aggregates of
full-length
Tau was observed by TEM after 120 h of incubation in the absence of
metal complexes. (B–D) Upon prolonged incubation with L1, L2,
and L3 the aggregates were destructed into shorter filaments. The
insets in each micrograph represent the morphology of disaggregation
of Tau at a magnification of 0.5 μm. (E) Cytotoxicity assay.
The MTT assay showed the dose-dependent cell toxicity with increasing
concentrations of CBMCs. At the higher concentrations of 50 and 100 μg
mL–1 of CBMCs cell viability was decreased to 50
and 30%, respectively. (F) Tau aggregates (5 μM) reduced the
viability of SH-SY5Y cells to less than 40%, which was found to be
reversed when incubated with CBMCs. (G) The phase contrast images
of SH-SY5Y cells showed the morphology of healthy cells at 10×
magnifications. The cells were treated with vehicle control, that
is, 2% DMSO did not show any toxicity. CBMCs did not affect the morphology
of the cells at 10 μg/mL, but the morphology of the cells were
changed at 100 μg mL–1, suggesting their toxicity.
L3 was observed to be the most toxic amongst three as the morphology
of cells were completely lost. (H) In comparison with the cell control,
Tau aggregate-treated cells showed the change in the morphology of
the cells indicating their toxicity. The vehicle control-treated cells
were observed to be healthy with neurite extensions suggesting the
nontoxic nature of the vehicle used. The cells were treated with 10
μg mL–1 of CBMCs suggested the morphological
changes, which could be due to Tau aggregates. This effect is pronounced
at 100 μg mL–1 concentration of CBMCs, L3
was found to be more toxic as the majority of the cells lost their
morphology; L1 and L2 were moderately toxic. The significance was
calculated using Tukey’s method and ***, **, and * indicated p value <0.001, <0.01, and <0.05, respectively.
ns is not significant where, p = >0.05.

CBMCs Maintained Tubulin Network in Neuronal
Cells
MTs are one of the cytoskeletal elements essential
for the maintenance
of cell shape, integrity, and cellular tracks for the transport of
cargos. Axonal Tau is involved in polymerizing tubulin to MTs. The
loss of Tau would lead to MT disassembly and thus neuronal degeneration.
CBMCs did not alter the levels of tubulin and Tau in SH-SY5Y cells
(Figures 7A,C and S13).49,51 The tubulin distribution
in SH-SY5Y suggested the maintenance of the tubulin network by L1
and L2. The quantification suggested no change in the tubulin levels
after CBMCs treatment; however, L3 led to a change in the cell morphology
as observed by the retraction of cellular extensions (Figure 7B). Further, the levels of
Tau phosphorylation at Ser212 and Thr214 was probed by AT100 antibody.
AT100 is a conformational antibody that interacts with the pTau present
as aggregates. In our present study the AT100 epitope in Tau has been
induced in SH-SY5Y cells by using OA. OA is known to induce Tau hyperphosphorylation
by inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 and PP2A. OA induces Tau phosphorylation
at various sites such as Ser202, Ser205, Ser212, Thr214, Ser262, Ser356,
and Ser404.52,53 The SH-SY5Y treated with OA showed
a change in the morphology where cellular extensions were retracted
and exhibited round-shaped cells, indicating the toxicity of OA. The
treatment with L1 rescued the cells from OA-induced cytotoxicity and
showed decreased levels of AT100 epitopes (Figures 8 and S14). L2
and L3 had no effect in reducing the AT100 levels. L2 however, prevented
the change in the morphology of SH-SY5Y cells in the presence of OA
(Figure S14). On the other hand, OA-induced
toxicity was observed in the presence of L3. Quantifying the levels
of pTau suggested the efficacy of L1 in reducing AT100 levels; L2
showed no change, whereas L3 increased the levels of pTau and total
Tau (Figure S16). These results indicate
that L1 and L2 prevented the cytotoxic effects of OA in contrary to
L3.

Figure 7 Tau levels are unaltered by CBMCs. (A) SH-SY5Y cells were treated
with CBMCs at a concentration of 25 μg/mL, and were probed for
the cytoskeletal network and levels of Tau by using pan Tau antibody
(K9JA). The immunofluorescence studies revealed that L1 and L2 maintained
the cytoskeletal network as probed by the β-tubulin antibody.
L3-treated cells showed a rounded morphology of the cells, indicating
the loss of the tubulin structure. (B) Quantification of tubulin levels
in SH-SY5Y as in (A) suggested that CBMCs do not change tubulin levels.
(C,D) Tau levels remain unaffected in SH-SY5Y cells on treatment with
L1 and L2. In comparison with the cell control the Tau levels were
observed to be increased in L3 treatment groups. Quantification of
Tau levels in SH-SY5Y as in (C), in terms of mean intensity per square
micrometer. The significance was calculated by SigmaPlot and ***,
**, and * indicated p value <0.001, <0.01,
and <0.05, respectively. ns is not significant where, p = >0.05.

Figure 8 pTau levels mapped by AT100 in an OA-induced
manner. In SH-SY5Y
cells Tau hyperphosphorylation was induced by OA. The AT100 epitope
that corresponds to phosphorylation at Ser212 and Thr214 was studied
by the immunofluorescence. L1 effectively reduced the levels of pTau
when compared to L2 and L3. L1 and L2 protected SH-SY5Y cells from
OA-induced toxicity, as the cell morphology was not altered. L3 failed
to prevent OA-induced toxicity and the cells exhibited rounded morphology
due to the loss of neurite extensions.

In summary, the newly developed molecular Co(II)-complexes (CBMCs)
showed a significant role in the inhibition and disaggregation of
Tau. The cytotoxicity studies on human SH-SY5Y cells revealed that
CBMCs are nontoxic in nature and helped in maintaining the tubulin
network at optimal concentrations under in vitro conditions. Furthermore,
CBMCs also prevented OA-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y thus preventing
cytotoxicity due to hyperphosphorylation of Tau. We firmly believe
that the present molecular Co(II)-complexes can be a potential therapeutic
agent for Alzheimer’s disease and related neurodegenerative
diseases.

spectra were recorded on an NMR spectrometer. Deuterated chloroform
was used as the solvent and chemical shift values (δ) were reported
in parts per million relative to the residual signals of this solvent
[δ 7.26 for 1H (chloroform-d), δ
77.2 for 13C{1H} (chloroform-d)]. Abbreviations used in the NMR follow-up experiments: br, broad;
s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; and m, multiplet.
Mass spectra were obtained on GCMS-QP 5000 instruments with an ionization
voltage of 70 eV (Scheme 1). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained by fast atom

Expression and Purification
of Tau
The recombinant
full-length Tau was expressed in the BL21* strain of Escherichia coli. Cells were induced with 0.5 mM
IPTG after the optical density (OD) at A600 reached 0.5–0.6. The cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C
postinduction and were harvested by pelleting at 4000 rpm, at 4 °C
for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mM MES buffer pH 6.8
containing 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, and a protease inhibitor cocktail and was lysed by using
a constant cell disruption system. The purification was done as described
previously with minor changes.54 The concentration
was estimated using the BCA method.

Preparation of Tau Aggregates
Tau was induced to aggregate
as described previously with minor modifications.54 In the presence of heparin (17 500 Da) at a ratio
of 4:1, Tau was polymerized in an assembly buffer containing 20 mM
BES, pH 7.4, 25 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% NaN3, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C
and the aggregates formation was monitored by ThS fluorescence, SDS-PAGE,
and TEM at 0 and 120 h.55,56 Tau protein was allowed
to assemble in the absence and presence of compounds in increasing
concentration with constant Tau concentrations of 0.91 mg mL–1.

Disaggregation Assay
The potency of the metal complexes
in disaggregating the preformed Tau aggregates was analyzed. Soluble
Tau was incubated at 37 °C, at a concentration of 4.58 mg mL–1 for the PHF assembly. The formation of aggregates
was analyzed by ThS fluorescence assay and SDS-PAGE. Thus, the formed
aggregates were diluted to 0.91 mg mL–1 final concentration
of 20 mM BES buffer, pH 7.4, and further, the mixture was incubated
with increasing concentration of the metal complex as discussed earlier.

Thioflavin S Fluorescence Assay
5 μL of reaction
mixture was diluted with 45 μL of 8 μM ThS in 50 mM ammonium
acetate, pH 7.0 and added to 384 well plates in triplicates. Subsequently
a blank was also prepared for subtracting the background fluorescence.
The plate was incubated for 20 min in the dark before measuring ThS
fluorescence, at an emission wavelength of 521 nm by exciting it at
440 nm in a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO multimode microplate reader.

SDS-PAGE Analysis for Tau Aggregates
The effect of
the compounds on inhibiting the aggregates formation by Tau was observed
by SDS-PAGE.57,58 The reaction mixture incubated
with and without the compound were collected at different time intervals
of 0, 24, and 72 h (end point) and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE using
a miniVE vertical electrophoresis system from GE Healthcare.

Soluble
Tau Assay
The soluble Tau was studied in the
presence of metal complexes alone to analyze the conformational change
occurring due to the compound. 0.91 mg mL–1 of Tau
was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with and without different concentrations
of 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg mL–1 of metal complexes.
At the end of 1 h the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, TEM, and
CD spectroscopy to monitor the formation of aggregates and the change
in Tau conformation, respectively.

CD Spectroscopy
The conformational change in Tau was
analyzed by CD spectroscopy in the far UV region. Tau is a random
coiled protein and upon aggregation it acquires β-sheet conformation.
The impact of the compounds on preventing the formation of the β-sheet
structure was studied by CD spectroscopy. The spectra was collected
as described previously, in a Jasco J-815 spectrometer, by using a
cuvette with 1 mm path length.59 The measurements
were performed in the range of 250–190 nm, with a data pitch
of 1.0 nm, and scanning speed of 100 nm min–1. All
the spectra were obtained at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was
diluted to 0.13 mg mL–1 in 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 6.8. The effect of the compound on soluble Tau was studied by incubating
Tau along with compounds alone at 37 °C and the spectra was read
at 25 °C.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
The extent of aggregates
formed in the presence of the metal complexes was analyzed by TEM
(Tecnai T-20). The assay mixture was diluted to 0.04 mg mL–1 final concentration, spotted on a carbon coated copper grid of 400
mesh and incubated for 45 s. The excess Tau aggregates were removed
by incubating the grid in water for 30 s and this was repeated twice.
The grid was further stained by 2% uranyl acetate for 1 min to observe
the morphology of aggregates under TEM.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
The high-molecular weight
species formed by Tau polymerization was analyzed by SEC.60−62 Tau protein was diluted to a concentration of 4.58 mg mL–1 in assembly buffer along with heparin in a ratio of 4:1 and incubated
at 37 °C in the presence and absence of 0.1 mg mL–1 of NNN-L2CoCl2. Tau was subjected to SEC using Superdex
75 PG in order to resolve aggregated Tau from the soluble, which was
accessed as a decrease in the retention volume at different time points
of 0, 2, and 24 h in the presence and absence of NNN-L2CoCl2.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
ITC was carried out
to understand the thermodynamics behind Tau interaction with CBMCs.
Here, the titration was done using 2.3 mg mL–1 of
full-length Tau and 0.407 mg mL–1 of L2. The titrations
were recorded in MicroCal PEAQ-ITC at 25 °C. The titration was
conducted by giving 19 injections, first injection of 0.4 μL
was followed by injections of 2 μL each with 240 s interval
at a stirring speed of 650 rpm. Tau and L2 were prepared in 20 mM
BES containing 50 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. The samples were re-buffered,
filtered, and loaded. The sample cell was loaded with 200 μL of full-length Tau and syringe
with 40 μL of L2. Similarly, L2 was titrated into BES buffer
as a compound control to measure the heat changes caused by the compound
alone. The data was analyzed in MicroCal PEAQ-ITC analysis software
and fitted to one set of site model. The heat change from buffer was
assigned as control and fitting was done using a line mode in analysis
software.

Cytotoxicity Assay
SH-SY5Y cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)-F12 media (Gibco) supplemented with 20%
FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin. Subconfluent
cells were harvested by trypsinization and 25 000 cells/well
were seeded in a 96 well plate (100 μL/well). The cells were
then incubated overnight at 37 °C. Postincubation, the cells
were treated with different concentrations of (10–100 mg mL–1) the compounds to study the toxic effect of CBMCs.
In order to study the effect of CBMCs on Tau-induced toxicity, cells
were first treated with 100 μL of DMEM containing 5 μM
full-length Tau aggregates, followed by the indicated amounts of CBMCs.
The full-length Tau aggregates alone were used as the control. After
12 h of incubation at 37 °C, cell viability was evaluated using
thiazolyl-blue-tetrazolium-bromide (MTT) assay. Each treatment was
performed in triplicates. Briefly, 10 μL of 5 mg mL–1 MTT was added into each well and further incubated for 4 h at 37
°C. Later, 100 μL of DMSO was added into each well and
the color intensity was measured using an ELISA reader at 570 nm.
The percentage of cell viability was calculated as following. Cells
viability (%) = OD (570 nm) in the presence of full-length Tau with
or without an inhibitor × 100.

Immunofluorescence Assay
SH-SY5Y cells were grown on coverslips
and kept for 24 h after seeding. The cells were treated with CBMCs
and OA at a concentration of 25 μg/mL and 25 nM for 24 h. Postincubation
the cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
and fixed using chilled methanol for 20 min at −20 °C.
The cells were further washed with PBS and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton
X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Triton X-100 was removed by
giving three PBS washes, followed by incubation with 2% horse serum
as a blocking agent at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were treated
with primary antibody at room temperature for 3 h. pan Tau antibody
(K9JA) against Tau and β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (BT7R)
were used in dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively. Phospho-Tau
(Thr212, Ser214) monoclonal antibody (AT100) was used at a dilution
of 1:100. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were washed thrice with
PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 conjugate and goat
anti-mouse Alexa 555 conjugate at the dilutions of 1:1000 and 1:500,
respectively. Further cells were washed twice with PBS and counterstained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. The coverslips
were mounted and allowed to dry. The SH-SY5Y cells were imaged under
Zeiss Axio Observer 7.

Quantitative Analysis
Quantification
of immunofluorescence
studies was performed using image analysis software in Zeiss Axio
Observer 7. The cell area was marked to measure the intensities for
tubulin, Tau, and pTau levels. The background intensity adjacent to
the cells was similarly calculated to obtain the final value. Thus
the obtained intensities were normalized with respect to the area
of the cell. Using SigmaPlot, plotted the mean intensity per square
micrometer of cell.

Statistical Analysis
Data are represented
in terms
of mean ± s.e.m. The cytotoxicity data was analyzed by Student’s t-test, two-tailed and unpaired at 95% confidence interval.
Tukey’s method was used for statistical analysis. The statistical
significance was determined as ***, **, and * which indicated p value <0.001, <0.01, and <0.05, respectively.
ns indicates not significant data where p value was
>0.05.
