In this study, we prepared polyaniline-intercalated iron
oxychloride (FeOCl-PANI) by aqueous intercalation method to use it
as a Fenton-like catalyst that was then assessed in terms of behavior
of intercalation, structural evolution, Fenton-like activity, and
catalytic mechanism. Gel-permeation chromatography demonstrated that
the molecular weight (polymerization extent) of polyaniline fragment
gradually increased with the increase of intercalation time. Interestingly,
the polyaniline-intercalated materials with varying intercalation
times exhibited distinctly different Fenton-like activity trends under
acidic (pH 4) and neutral (pH 7) conditions. Specifically, Fenton-like
degradation is favored with a shorter intercalation time under acidic
conditions, while it is preferred with a longer intercalation time
under neutral pH values. We propose that an additional pH-dependent
charging of FeOCl-PANI with different polymerization extents of the
intercalated polyaniline promotes a switch in the contaminant degradation
pathway, leading to opposite trends in observable activity at different
pH values. As a class of typical layered metal chalcogenohalides (MeAX,
A = O, S, Se, X = Cl, Br, I), FeOCl-PANI is expected to provide new
insights into the development of other similar materials. This work
could be useful to further understand the H2O2 heterogeneous activation behavior, which is of significance to the
application of iron-based heterogeneous Fenton oxidation.

1 Introduction
The generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) by reacting ferrous iron (Fe2+) and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), namely Fenton’s
reaction, has been widely employed as an effective route of degrading
organic pollutants in water treatment and soil remediation.1 Heterogeneous Fenton systems that activate H2O2 on the surface of iron-based solid catalysts
have recently attracted extensive attention owing to their high efficiency
and low cost.2−6 Similar to the
classical Fenton (Haber–Weiss) mechanism, H2O2 activation on solid iron-based catalysts is achieved via
the catalytic Fe(II)/Fe(III) cycle,7 and
the heterogeneous nature of such surface reactions can potentially
enable Fenton chemistry near neutral conditions. In the catalytic
cycle, Fe(III) reduction on air-stable heterogeneous Fenton catalysts
is considered the rate-determining step, and the thermodynamically
unfavorable Fe(III) reduction under near-neutral pH conditions causes
a significantly reduced ROS generation rate.8 In such a context, developing novel iron-based materials with a
controlled electronic structure and facile active site generation
is highly desired for promoting heterogeneous Fenton activity under
environmentally relevant and more practical near-neutral pH conditions.

Among all iron-based heterogeneous Fenton catalysts, iron oxychloride
(FeOCl) is one of the most promising candidates, exhibiting 2–4
orders of magnitude higher hydroxyl radical generation rates than
traditional iron-based materials.9−11 Fabricated FeOCl-based nanocatalysts were recently
demonstrated to be efficient for photo-Fenton,12−14 water splitting,15 heavy metal adsorption,16−18 or the catalytic hydroxylation of benzene.19 In addition, an interesting and unique property of FeOCl is its
layered crystal structure, in which the FeOCl sheets are stacked via
weak van der Waals interactions allowing for the intercalation of
various guest molecules, such as amines and organometallic cations.20−22 For example, the intercalation
of amines induces a charge transfer between the lone electron pair
on the nitrogen atom and the conduction band in FeOCl, causing the
in situ reduction of Fe(III) in the FeOCl matrix and the oxidative
polymerization of amines.23−25 The tunable charge transfer between the intercalated guests and
the FeOCl matrix offers the exciting opportunity to alter the surface
electronic states of FeOCl catalysts as well as to improve heterogeneous
Fenton activity for sustainable applications.23,24,26 In the meantime, the intercalation will
transfer the bulk crystal of FeOCl into two-dimensional nanolayered
materials, increase the specific surface area, and create new catalytic
environment to facilitate
the reaction.

In this work, polyaniline-intercalated FeOCl (FeOCl-PANI)
was prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in the interlayer
region and used as a Fenton-like catalyst to degradate bisphenol A
(BPA) and other organic pollutants under acidic and neutral pH. Intercalation
of polyaniline significantly enhanced the Fenton-like activity at
both acidic and neutral pH conditions, compared to the FeOCl parent
material. FeOCl-PANI with varying intercalation times exhibited distinct
Fenton-like activity trends in a pH-dependent manner. It is postulated
that the effect of in situ aniline polymerization on the structural
and chemical properties of the FeOCl leads to the differences in Fenton-like
activity between acidic and neutral pH values. These results of this
study will further provide insights into designing more efficient
catalysts for promoting the potential applications of iron-based solid
materials in Fenton oxidation.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of FeOCl and
FeOCl-PANI
Herein, we report the synthesis of polyaniline-intercalated
FeOCl (FeOCl-PANI) by in situ polymerization of aniline in the interlayer
region and the application of FeOCl-PANI for organic pollutant degradation
in near-neutral pH conditions. The FeOCl was prepared using the chemical
vapor transport method, which can be upscaled much more readily.27 During intercalation with aniline, the solids
gradually turned into dark brown and black microcrystals within 4
h. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure 1a) was performed to investigate the structural
evolution during the intercalation process. Pristine FeOCl showed
reflections at 2θ values consistent with the standard XRD pattern
of pure FeOCl (JCPDS no. 73-2229), while intercalated FeOCl showed
peaks shifted toward smaller angles, indicating successful intercalation.
Calculated unit cell parameters (Table S3) demonstrate that intercalation of aniline into FeOCl resulted in
a lattice expansion of 5.69 Å (from 7.92 to 13.61 Å), consistent
with reported values.21,22,28 The
heterogeneous Fenton application of FeOCl was limited by its small
surface area (<10 m2/g). However, the pristine van der
Waals (vdW) layer (7.92 Å) was almost fully occupied by the Cl
atoms (with vdW radius of 1.75 Å), and the free transportation
space (∼4.42 Å) is limited for most apolar molecules.
After intercalation, the distance between Cl···Cl vdW
layer and the free space could increase simultaneously. More interestingly,
the samples obtained after different durations of intercalation exhibited
almost identical XRD peak positions, but, gradually, broadened peaks
with increasing intercalation times were obtained (Table S4). These results imply that the change of the crystalline
structure of FeOCl matrix is completed within 4 h, whereas, the structural
evolution within the layers continues to take place over the course
of our experiments (12 days). Because we consistently observed FeOCl
plate-like structures in all samples with scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figures 1b,c
and S1), we propose that the structural
evolution takes place within the particles and sheets rather than
at the macroscopic scale.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of pristine FeOCl and FeOCl-PANI of different
intercalation times; (b,c) SEM images of pristine and 12 days intercalated
FeOCl.

The chemical nature of the polyaniline-intercalated
FeOCl was further investigated using a range of complementary spectroscopic
techniques. In the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum, pristine
FeOCl had two major peaks at 490 and 1630 cm–1 (Figure 2a), which are attributed
to Fe–O and Fe–Cl vibrations, respectively.29 The presence of characteristic PANI peaks at
650–1600 cm–1 (cyan-colored region in Figure 2a) further corroborates
the intercalation and in situ polymerization of aniline within the
FeOCl layers, in which the vibration peaks at 1490, 745, and 687 cm–1 are assigned to the protonated aniline monomer (AnH+).24 The polymerization of aniline
was induced by the electron transfer from FeOCl matrix to aniline
in the intercalation process, as evidenced by the larger molecular
weight of PANI after longer intercalation times (Table S5). Surprisingly, the peak indicative of Fe–Cl
vibrations (1630 cm–1) diminished and almost disappeared
during the intercalation process, indicating the weakening or breaking
of Fe–Cl bonds in FeOCl upon intercalation. This observation
is further supported by the attenuated and positively shifted Fe–Cl
bond distances at ∼2.3–2.4 Å in the extended X-ray
absorption fine spectra (EXAFS, Figure 2b). The presence of observable Fe–Cl bond distances
after a relatively short intercalation time (4 h and 3 days) suggests
that the Fe–Cl bond breaking process is a kinetically slow
process, which may be attributed to the interaction between the spatially
confined aniline in the interlayer region and Fe(III) centers of the
Fe–Cl entities. The loss of Cl from Fe centers could potentially
create an open coordination site for catalysis, which will be discussed
later. The XPS study was carried out to explore the change of the
element’s chemical environment during the intercalation process.
The survey XPS spectra (Figure S2) show
that Fe, O, and Cl signals are present in pristine FeOCl and FeOCl-PANI
samples, while the N signal only exists in the FeOCl-PANI sample.
The Cl 2p binding energy of PANI-intercalated FeOCl is increased by
∼0.4 eV (Figure 2c), which may be due to the increase of Cl valence caused by the
cleavage of Fe–Cl bond. The high-resolution curve-fitted Fe
2p3/2 spectra show that an additional shoulder peak at
a lower binding energy appears after intercalation, corresponding
to a reduced Fe(II) species (Figure 2d). We further discovered that the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio
gradually increased with increasing intercalation times (Table S6), which could be contributed by Fe(III)
reduction under oxidative aniline polymerization. This result is consistent
with the increase of molecular weight of PANI confirmed by gel-permeation
chromatography (GPC). According to the aforementioned data, we proposed
that the aniline intercalation into FeOCl is a fast process, while
the in situ oxidative aniline polymerization is slow and may take
several days to complete.

durations.

More information about charge transfer
that was suggested to occur during the intercalation process could
be revealed by Mössbauer spectroscopy, which shows that Fe
in both FeOCl and FeOCl-PANI is mostly present as the oxidized Fe(III)
species, with no detectable Fe(II) in the spectra of pristine FeOCl
(Figure 3, Table S7). The Fe(II) content detected with Mössbauer
spectroscopy is highly similar in all FeOCl-PANI samples and ranges
between 9.2 and 11.9% of the total Fe with no clear trend with the
intercalation time (Table S7). The presence
of Fe(II)-like species was identified by the emergence of an additional
Fe(III) component in the Mössbauer spectra of FeOCl-PANI, with
parameters consistent with those of akagenéite.24,30 Interestingly, in Mössbauer spectra acquired at 50 K, we
observed broadening of one of the Fe(III) doublets with increasing
intercalation time and, after 7 and 12 days of intercalation, even
partial magnetic ordering of one or more of the Fe(III) components.
The observed trends are indicative of increasing long-range (magnetic)
ordering of differently coordinated Fe species within the FeOCl sheets.
We suspect that this observation can be rationalized by the increased
PANI polymer size within the FeOCl interlayers, which could increase
the connectivity of Fe(III) centers that have been separated by the
formation of presumably randomly distributed Fe(II) species during
the polymerization process and/or by redistribution of Fe(II) and
Fe(III) in the FeOCl sheets over time via bulk electron conduction.
The emerging interlayer structure is a unique property of FeOCl with
this intercalation modification strategy. The structural evolution
is demonstrated as Scheme 1.

for different durations.

and in Situ Polymerization within FeOCl
2.2 Catalytic Activity
We first distinguished
the effect aniline from the aspects of physical mixing versus chemical
intercalation aniline on the catalytic activity of FeOCl in control
reactors. In one control group, namely “aniline-dropping”,
a certain amount of aniline was directly added to reactors containing
pristine FeOCl, whose amount added was calculated based on the nitrogen
element content of FeOCl-PANI sample (after 12 days of intercalation)
obtained by elemental analysis. Thus, aniline did not affect BPA degradation
by regulating the structure of FeOCl in this control group. In the
other control group (“aniline-mixing”), again, the same
amount of aniline was dropped onto pristine FeOCl and left for 5 min
prior to starting the transformation experiment to mimic the initial
intercalation process. As shown in Figure S3, the aniline-dropping control showed comparable activity to that
of pristine FeOCl, implying that the addition of aniline alone cannot
facilitate Fe dissolution or enhance Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycling
on the surface of FeOCl to increase Fenton activity. In contrast,
the aniline-mixing control group exhibited significantly higher reactivity,
demonstrating that aniline affects the intrinsic activity of FeOCl
by intercalation and/or structural alterations.

Subsequently,
we analyzed the Fenton activity of our FeOCl-PANI materials in reactions
buffered at pH 4. FeOCl-PANI subjected to 4 h of intercalation showed
a much higher BPA degradation after 60 min compared to pristine FeOCl,
and the observed reactivity gradually decreased for FeOCl-PANI with
longer intercalation times. More interestingly, when the pH value
of the buffer solution was changed to ∼7, the FeOCl-PANI catalysts
displayed the reverse trend: the observed reactivity increased with
increasing intercalation time. The FeOCl-PANI sample with 12 days
intercalation time could reach an unprecedented ∼53% BPA degradation
in neutral circumstances, which is much higher than that of the pristine
FeOCl (∼20%), demonstrating the high potential of heterogeneous
Fenton reactivity on intercalated FeOCl systems (Figure 4a,b). The time evolution of
BPA degradation followed pseudo-first-order kinetics (Figure S4), whose calculated reaction rates are
listed in Table 1.
Compared with the pristine FeOCl, the reaction rate of PANI-intercalated
FeOCl increased by ∼12 times (4 h intercalated sample) and
∼3 times (12 days intercalated sample) at pH 4 and pH 7, respectively.
The distinct reactivity trends observed at the two pH values suggest
a crucial role of the FeOCl-PANI structure for the resulting Fenton
reactivity. We suspect that the strong pH-dependence might be connected
to changes in the structure of the polyaniline-intercalated FeOCl,
which could strongly affect the adsorption behavior of BPA. To verify
our hypothesis, we evaluated the adsorption capacities of FeOCl-PANI
for BPA at different pH values in adsorption experiments without H2O2. The adsorption of BPA showed a similar trend
of BPA degradation (Figure 4c,d), suggesting that the adsorption of BPA was a crucial
step for its degradation in the subsequent heterogeneous Fenton reaction.

BPA degradation at pH 4 (a) and pH 7 (b). Total removal and adsorption

ppm, and reaction time: 1 h for acidic condition and 24 h for neutral
condition.

To exclude the possibility of specific BPA adsorption in our FeOCl-PANI
system, three other organics, nitrobenzene (NB), 2-chlorophenol (2-CP),
and 2-methoxyphenol (2-MeOP), were chosen as model pollutants to further
investigate the reactivity of this system. Due to the difference in
the influence of the substituent on the π electron density of
benzene ring, the reactivity of these compounds when oxidized by Fenton
mechanism is as follows: 2-MeOP > 2-CP > NB. These compounds
can represent different types of wastewater, and their basic physical
and chemical properties are listed in Table S8. Similar pH-dependent adsorption and degradation were also found
for these pollutants (Figure 5a,b), indicating that the catalytic activity of FeOCl-PANI
with different intercalation times on pollutants is nonspecific. Although
the adsorption and degradation behaviors of the three pollutants have
the same trend as the change of intercalation time, there are significant
differences among them. Under any reaction condition, 2-MeOP showed
the highest degradation rate among the three pollutants, while NB
was always the lowest. The difference in the degradation ability between
2-MeOP and NB is due to differences in their intrinsic reactivity
because the methoxyl and phenolic hydroxyl groups are electron-donating
groups that contribute to the activation of the benzene ring. In contrast,
electron-withdrawing nitro group has an inhibitory effect on the activation
of the benzene ring.31 The degradation
ability of 2-CP at different pH values is quite different. At acidic
condition, it can degrade as easily as 2-MeOP. But its degradation
ability is close to that of NB under neutral condition, showing a
strong reaction inertness. This characteristic degradation ability
of 2-CP may be related to its adsorption behavior in the interlayers
between FeOCl-PANI, in which it can generate H-bonds with PANI. The
pH may change the stability of H-bonding network in the interlayers,
which has a great influence on the degradation activity of 2-CP. We
will elaborate in the reaction mechanism section.

The experimental conditions are the same as that of BPA degradation.

2.3 Structural Stability of Catalyst
Detailed characterization results have confirmed that aniline is
polymerized to form PANI in the intercalated preparation of FeOCl-PANI,
in which PANI is stabilized between the FeOCl interlayers by Cl–N
bonding interaction. However, considering aniline is an organic chemical
that is harmful to the environment and human health, it is necessary
to clarify the structural stability of FeOCl-PANI under the reaction
conditions. As for all sample solutions, aniline peak was not found
in the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) diagrams, indicating
that the PANI in the FeOCl interlayers did not depolymerize and release
into the solution during the reaction. The stability and reusability
were further evaluated. As shown in Figure 6a, no significant differences are found for
BPA degradation activity after at least five cycles. The characteristic
PANI peaks and FeOCl skeleton vibration peaks of used catalyst showed
no obvious change in the FTIR spectra (Figure 6b), which further suggests that no (poly)aniline
release results from the deintercalation process under the reaction
conditions. The high structural stability was also evidenced by similar
morphology under SEM observation (Figures 6c and S5). In
addition, we tested the leaching of Fe during the reaction. Our measured
aqueous Fe concentrations in all samples after the reaction were less
than 7.4 ppm at pH 4 (7.1% dissolution of FeOCl) and less than 0.22
ppm at pH 7 (0.21% dissolution of FeOCl) (Table S9), which was also the proof of high stability. In both conditions,
activity contribution from homogeneous Fenton is negligible and could
not explain the observed pH-dependent reactivity trends. All these
results point to the conclusion that FeOCl-PANI is a class of heterogeneous
Fenton catalysts with high structural stability.

4 h at pH 4 and FeOCl-PANI 12 days at pH 7) were selected to test,
respectively; FTIR spectra (b) and SEM image (c) of reused pristine
and intercalated FeOCl after reaction at pH 7.

2.4 ROS and Active Sites Investigation
Since the catalytic activity of the heterogeneous Fenton reaction
stems from the generation of ROS by activating H2O2 on the catalyst surface, we further investigated the difference
in ROS generation between pristine FeOCl and FeOCl-PANI using electronic
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide) was utilized to capture free radicals and the signature
peaks of the DMPO–·OH adduct with an intensity ratio of
1:2:2:1 were observed at both pH 4 and pH 7 (Figure 7a,b, respectively), suggesting the existence
of hydroxyl radicals (·OH) at both pH values.32 In addition, other small peaks were observed at pH 7, and
the similar peaks were also found at pH 4 when we amplified the EPR
signal within a narrow intensity range (Figure S6), which may be due to the presence of impurities in the
DMPO or their oxidation to other paramagnetic species.33,34 Moreover, after the PANI intercalation, the FeOCl showed a slightly
enhanced adduct signal, which was not sufficient to explain the significant
increase in pollutant degradation activity. We could not observe much
difference between the FeOCl-PANI samples intercalated for different
durations, suggesting that ROS generation might not be the critical
parameter that is affected by the structural evolution in the interlayer
spaces and responsible for the distinct catalytic activity trends
observed. Further, phosphate (a Lewis base, pKa (H2O2) < pKa (PO43–), which has stronger
affinity to the surface coordinatively unsaturated metal sites than
H2O2 or water, was used to regulate the amount
of surface active sites of FeOCl-PANI.35 As shown in Figure 8, the degradation of BPA was almost unaffected at pH 4 by the addition
of 10 mM phosphate but was significantly inhibited at pH 7, indicating
that the degradation process is controlled by intrinsic reactions
on the catalyst surface at pH 7, while the process is switched to
diffusion-controlled reaction at pH 4.

values: (a) pH 4 and (b) pH 7.

and pH 7 (b), in which the best activity catalysts under the two pH
values (FeOCl-PANI 4 h at pH 4 and FeOCl-PANI 12 days at pH 7) were
selected to test, respectively.

2.5 Effect of Interlayer Structure on Heterogeneous
Fenton Activity of FeOCl-PANI
EPR studies have shown that
the generation of ROS is not a decisive factor in the difference in
FeOCl-PANI heterogeneous Fenton activity. Therefore, we believe that
the interlayer structure evolution of FeOCl caused by aniline intercalation
is the key in the enhancement of its activity. According to our observation
that the intercalation is kinetically fast and polymerization is relatively
slow, FeOCl-PANI with shorter intercalation time should mostly consist
of AnH+ and short PANI fragments in the interlayer region,
which is confirmed by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table S5). Under pH 4 conditions when turnovers
for the Fenton reaction are favored, the accessibility of organic
pollutant molecules to the catalytic sites may be critical to its
degradation, that is, the diffusion of pollutants to the active sites
in the interlayer region is the rate-determining step. So, FeOCl intercalated
for short durations has a comparatively dilute and exchangeable environment
in the interlayer that can possibly facilitate the diffusion organic
pollutant molecules into the vicinity of the catalytic sites, which
is also evidenced by the higher adsorption capacity of these samples.
Moreover, the poorly polymerized aniline has the extensive H-bonding
network and can share H-bond with phenolic pollutants,36 where the phenolic hydroxyl radical may serve
as the proton donor.37 The formation of
H-bond enhances the electronegativity of the aromatic ring of phenolic
pollutants, which is more conducive to the attack of HO·.38

At pH 7, in contrast, the Fenton reaction
is less favored for turnovers and thus the H2O2 activation is expected to become the rate-determining step. The
increase in pH enhances the deprotonation tendency of AnH+ and PANI fragments and limits the formation of H-bonds, which adversely
affects the diffusion and adsorption of pollutants into the interlayers.
Thus, the neutral reaction behavior may be attributed to the reduction
of Fe(III) and the weakening of Fe–Cl bonds, which create unique
reaction spaces that strengthen the adsorption and degradation of
pollutants. Phosphate experiments revealed that the coordinatively
unsaturated Fe(II) sites induced by PANI intercalation are the Fenton
active sites, in which the unsaturated structure may be efficient
to promote the Fenton cycle, especially the unfavorable reduction
of Fe(III). It has been suggested that the Fe(II) species is more
active than the Fe(III) species for heterogeneous Fenton reaction.39 Consistent with this argument, we found that
contaminant decomposition rates with FeOCl-PANI almost linearly correlated
with the fraction of Fe(II) species in the sample (Figure S7). Although the FeOCl-PANI Fe(II) content determined
with Mössbauer spectroscopy does not indicate the same trend
as found with XPS, we suggest that these differences might have resulted
from different portions of the material being sampled by these two
techniques: while XPS penetrates only the outer 2 nm of the sample,40 Mössbauer spectroscopy is a bulk analysis
method. Taking into account that partial magnetic ordering in FeOCl-PANI,
indicative of increased sizes of Fe(III) domains within FeOCl sheets,
increased in parallel to the Fe(II) content determined with XPS, we
suggest that the results from these two methods indeed point to the
same underlying mechanism. In addition, as demonstrated by the results
of Mössbauer spectrum, the akagenéite-like iron sites
have higher densities of exchangeable hydroxyl group,41 suggesting that pollutants can coordinately adsorb at the
Fe(II) sites. Adsorbed pollutants can be degraded more easily because
of the higher concentration of ROS near the sites. Some studies have
reported that there is inhibition on the adsorption of pollutants
in the existence of the coexisting cationics.42−44 We speculate that FeOCl-PANI with shorter
intercalation time has a more detrimental effect on pollutant adsorption
because of more AnH+ in the interlayer region.

3 Conclusions
The structural evolution
of the FeOCl catalyst upon aniline intercalation and in situ polymerization
provides a versatile way of altering its heterogeneous Fenton reactivity
for pollutant degradation. The intercalated structure not only showed
an expansion of interlayer lattice but also exhibited surface changes
in the chemical environment of the Fe/Cl species. The enhanced activity
was tentatively attributed to the H-bonding network provided by the
intercalated aniline and the generation of structural Fe(II) sites
and akagenéite-like phase induced by aniline polymerization
(Scheme 2). We used
a facile way of intercalating FeOCl catalysts, which not only provides
a new route of improving heterogeneous Fenton reaction but also enables
high pollutant degradation rates at environmentally relevant circum-neutral
pH values, opening up a broad range of potential future applications.
Intercalation of polyaniline significantly enhanced the catalytic
activity and organic pollutants degradation at neutral pH conditions,
compared to the FeOCl parent material. The effect of in situ aniline
polymerization on the structural and chemical properties of the FeOCl
matrix was further investigated. Synthesizing our results, we propose
a possible mechanism for ROS production on the surface of FeOCl-PANI,
which may further provide insights into designing more efficient catalysts.
The development of such highly active FeOCl-PANI catalysts may not
only shine light on heterogeneous Fenton chemistry but also open up
a new avenue of exploring layered materials in environmental applications
using intercalation chemistry.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Material Synthesis and Characterization
FeOCl was synthesized using the chemical vapor transport method.26 Fe2O3 and anhydrous FeCl3 powders with a molar ratio of 1:1.3 were first mixed in a
glove box under N2 atmosphere. The mixed powder was sealed
in a glass container, which was then heated to 653 K at a ramping
rate of 1 K/min and maintained at 653 K for 40 h in a muffle furnace.
Once cooled to room temperature, the obtained purple product was rinsed
with anhydrous acetone to remove excess FeCl3 and dried
overnight at 60 °C in a vacuum oven.

FeOCl-PANI was prepared
using the modified method reported by Wu et al.24 In a typical procedure, 60 mL of 5% aniline solution in
acetonitrile was stirred with 0.50 g FeOCl in air at 25 °C. The
intercalated products were washed and dried following the same procedures
as the nonintercalated FeOCl.

Pristine FeOCl and its products
intercalated for different time intervals were characterized by powder
X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS),
extended X-ray adsorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS), and
Mössbauer spectroscopy. The polymerization degree of PANI was
determined by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC), and ROS generation
was investigated by electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.
The detailed information about the characterization can be found in
the Supporting Information (SI).

4.2 Catalytic Activity Measurements
The
catalytic activities of unintercalated and intercalated FeOCl were
evaluated by the degradation of bisphenol A (BPA), nitrobenzene (NB),
2-chlorophenol (2-CP), and 2-methoxyphenol (2-MeOP) under both acidic
and neutral pH. All experiments were performed in 100 mL reactors
(50 mL reaction solution containing 0.2 g/L catalyst and 15 mM H2O2) with constant stirring at 600 rpm at 25 °C.
Acetate (20 mM) and 20 mM piperazine-N,N′-bis(ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) aqueous buffer solutions
were used for reactions at pH 4.0 ± 0.2 and 7.0 ± 0.2, respectively,
which was demonstrated to be the most suitable buffer matrix before.45 The suspension was stirred for 30 min to reach
the adsorption equilibrium and the reaction was initiated by adding
a desired dosage of H2O2. Finally, 0.5 mL of
methanol was added into the reaction solution to quench the reaction,
and the samples were filtered immediately through a 0.22 μm
PTFE filter film for analysis.

The concentration of BPA and
other probe pollutants was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC, Waters 2795). The leaching concentrations of Fe were determined
using introductive coupled plasma optical-emission spectroscopy (ICP-MS,
Agilent 725ES). More details about the analyses can be found in the SI. At least three replicates for each experiment
were carried out, and the average values with standard deviations
are presented for each set of data.
