Pendent functionalization of biodegradable
polymers provides unique
importance in biological applications. In this work, we have synthesized
a polymeric nanocarrier for the controlled release of the anticancer
drug doxorubicin (DOXI). Inspired by the pH responsiveness of acylhydrazine
bonds along with the interesting self-assembly behavior of amphiphilic
copolymers, this report delineates the development of a PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI copolymer consisting of DOXI, PEG, and a caprolactone backbone.
First, the inclusion of a PEG moiety in the copolymer helps to achieve
biocompatibility and aqueous solubility as well as a prolonged circulation
time of the nanocarrier. Second, an acid-sensitive acylhydrazine-based
linkage is chosen to attach DOXI to trigger sustained drug release,
whereas the inclusion of an enzymatically cleavable disulfide linkage
in the backbone adds to the advantage of backbone biodegradability
at the intracellular level.

Introduction
Polymeric
nanoparticles show an enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) effect.1−5 Because of this, their physical and chemical properties can be tuned
so as to achieve the aspects of a drug carrier. In the field of drug
delivery, the most commonly used biodegradable polymers are poly ε-caprolactone
(PCL), poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) (PACA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PGLA), and their copolymers.6 These polymers are both biocompatible as well as biodegradable.7,8 Biodegradable polymers, because of their degradability into small
molecules, are superior in biomedical applications as they are readily
metabolized and can be excreted from the body. Besides, the presence
of PEG chains in the copolymer helps reducing opsonization and slows
the clearance by the immune system.9,10 The ring-opening
polymerization (ROP) of lactones is an emerging synthetic technique
because of its versatility to produce a wide range of biomedical polymers
in a controlled manner.11−13,40−46 However, pendent functionalizations of polycaprolactones are still
a promising area of research because of their potential synthetic
challenges.14−16

A polymer-based “prodrug” approach
is a robust technique
of drug modification,38,39 for example, elimination of the
burst mechanism in drug release and tuning of drug pharmacokinetics.
Several doxorubicin (DOXI)-based prodrugs have been synthesized and
evaluated.17−19 The primary amino and keto groups of DOXI are used
for covalent attachment to the polymer backbone. Now, there are many
ways by which the drug can be covalently attached to the copolymer
via hydrolytically labile bonds such as imines,20 acetals,21 oximes,22−24 orthoesters,25 and acylhydrazines.23,24,26 Among these linkers, we are especially
fascinated by acylhydrazine linkers for their subtle response in drug
delivery.5,17,23−28,37 The drugs attached to the acylhydrazine
linkers are released rapidly under the acidic conditions as compared
to the physiological media (pH 7.4). In addition to pH responsiveness,
the reductive nature of disulfide bonds in polymer prodrugs has also
been reported.29−32 The disulfide bond, being stable under physiological conditions,
gets reduced to the corresponding alcohol in the intracellular region
because of the presence of a high concentration of glutathione (GSH,
10 mM).33−36

Herein, we have designed a system that responds to both pH
and
enzymes for a better therapeutic efficiency. First, we have synthesized
and thoroughly characterized the newly designed copolymer PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI. The presence of amphiphilicity in the design induces self-assembly
to generate nanoaggregates. Electron microscopy (scanning electron
microscopy [SEM] and transmission electron microscopy [TEM]) studies
confirm the vesicular nature of the observed nanoaggregates. Dialysis
studies on nanoaggregates against an acidic medium confirm the pH
responsiveness of the acylhydrazine linker. The reductive behavior
of the newly designed copolymer in the presence of dithiothreitol
(DTT) suggests the biodegradable nature of the backbone. Once the
nanocarriers are internalized into the tumor cells, the acylhydrazine
linkages are exposed to the acidic condition because of the collapse
of the nanocarrier. Because of this, the
DOXI molecules are sustainably released. In addition, because of the
presence of GSH, in the tumor tissue, the nanocarriers rapidly disaggregate
and the DOXI-attached chains are more exposed to the acidic environment
for the sustained release. The cell viability studies support the
biocompatible nature of the system, whereas epifluorescence microscopy
and flow cytometry analysis suggest the increased internalization
of DOXI into the cells. We are expecting that our newly designed nanocarrier
will have greater application in the field of cancer therapy.

Procedure for Polymerization
Polymerization was carried
out under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen in a glovebox. The compound
mixture 6a and 6b (150 mg, 0.98 mmol), ε-caprolactone
(1.005 g, 8.82 mmol), PEG-SS-OH (196 mg, 0.098 mmol),
Sn(OTf)2 (0.075 g, 0.181 mmol), and toluene (3 mL) were
taken in a vial. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir
for 48 h at room temperature. The polymerization mixture was quenched
by adding HCl (1 N, 2 mL). Then, it was poured into acetone (5 mL)
and precipitated in cold hexane (20 mL). Then, copolymer was collected
and dried under vacuum. The copolymer was a light yellow viscous liquid. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.03 (m, 1H), 4.01

nature of the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) trace confirmed
controlled polymerization.

Results and Discussion
It is desirable
that a drug delivery vehicle should increase the
drug solubility and decrease the toxicity, releasing the drug in a
sustained manner.5,17,23−28,37 Inspired by these requirements,
this article reports on developing an efficient method to covalently
attach DOXI and poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) as pendent motifs to the biodegradable caprolactone with an
S–S linker in the backbone (Scheme 4), which is explored systematically in this work. Towards
this goal, the functionalization of lactones was performed in two
steps (Scheme 3). At
first, compound 5 was synthesized40 from cyclohexanone in the presence of LDA and propargyl
bromide at −78 °C. The crude product was first purified
by column chromatography, followed by distillation under reduced pressure
at 160 °C, which yielded compound 5 as a colorless,
viscous liquid (62%). The formation of compound 5 was
confirmed by observing a new signal at δ 1.95 ppm in 1H NMR spectroscopy corresponding to terminal acetylene protons (Figure S12). Next, m-chloroperbenzoic
acid was added to the distilled product in dichloromethane solvent
(Baeyer–Villiger oxidation). An isomeric mixture of 3-((prop-2-ynyl)
oxepan-2-one), 6a, and 7-((prop-2-ynyl) oxepan-2-one), 6b, in 62% yield was obtained by distillation using a vacuum
pump.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of PEG-CDI and PEG-SS-OH
Scheme 3 Synthesis of Compounds 6a and 6b
Scheme 4 Synthesis of PEG-SS-PCL and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI
The mixture of lactones was characterized by 1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Figures S14 and S15). Then, the S–S linker containing PEG-SS-OH was synthesized as shown in the Scheme 2. At first, PEG-OH was reacted with carbodiimidazole
(CDI) in the presence of THF, which gave PEG-CDI as a
colorless solid. Product formation was confirmed by 1H
NMR (Figure S8) and MALDI-TOF spectroscopy
(Figure S9). The product was further reacted
with 2,2-disulfanediyldiethanol and DBU in chloroform as the solvent.
The purification of the crude product was carried out by reprecipitation
with diethyl ether to get pure PEG-SS-OH as a colorless
solid. The formation of macro initiator PEG-SS-OH was
confirmed by 1H NMR (Figure S10) and MALDI-TOF spectroscopy. The increase in the molecular weight
by 88 units confirmed the formation of the product (Figure S11).

Next, the attachment of the DOXI component
to the PEG-SS-PCL copolymer was performed (Scheme 4). Azide-functionalised doxorubicin
with an acylhydrazine
linker (DOXI-N3) was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1 following the literature procedure37 and thoroughly characterized (Figures S1–S7 and 3b). After
isolating the mixture of compounds 6a and 6b,42,43 we explored the copolymerization condition
with ε-caprolactone. We employed the ROP method to copolymerize
the mixture of compounds 6a and 6b with
ε-caprolactone at room temperature for 48 h under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The macro initiator PEG-SS-OH initiated the
reaction, and Sn(OTf)2 was used as a catalyst in toluene.
The copolymer PEG-SS-PCL was synthesized at M/I = 100
by adding 2 mol % catalyst relative to the initiator. The ratio of
the reagent was ([6a and 6b]:[ε-CL]:[Sn(OTf)2]:[PEG-SS-OH] = 10:90:5:1). The copolymer was
analyzed by 1H NMR (Figure 1a), FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure 3a), and GPC techniques. The observed GPC
chromatogram of the PEG-SS-PCL copolymer was unimodal
with Mn = 7700 g/mol and PDI = 1.25 using
polystyrene standards (Figure 2). From the PDI, it is evident that the polymerization was
well controlled.

Figure 2 GPC analysis of PEG-SS-OH and PEG-SS-PCL.

After successful synthesis of
the copolymer PEG-SS-PCL, the attachment of DOXI-N3 was performed using alkyne–azide
click chemistry. The reaction was carried out by employing the alkyne-functionalized
copolymer, DOXI-N3 (4), with sodium ascorbate,
and copper(II) sulfate.40 Usually, the
coupling reactions between azide and alkyne were carried out in water
or mixtures of water and a polar solvent. However, we performed the
click reaction in THF and water (1:1) and by stirring the reaction
mixture for 24 h at room temperature. The pure PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI copolymer was obtained by the subsequent evaporation of water using
a high-vacuum pump. The formation of the copolymer was confirmed by 1H NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy. In the 1H NMR spectroscopy
of the copolymer PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, all of the characteristic
peaks of polyethylene oxide, DOXI, and polycaprolactone were present.
Additionally, a new peak was observed at δ 7.37 ppm corresponding
to the triazole protons (Figure 1b). It was further confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy,
where the azide stretching frequency at 2095 cm–1 disappeared (Figure 3c). GPC analysis was carried out to indicate
the efficiency of the click reaction using polystyrene as the standard.
The Mn shifted from 7700 to 10 200
g/mol with PDI = 2.3 (Figure S19).

The richness of amphiphilicity
in PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI prompted
us to measure the CAC in water using pyrene as a fluorescent probe
(Figure 4a). Towards
this goal, we dissolved 4 μg of pyrene in methanol. Next, we
prepared a few samples with several concentrations of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI. We dissolved the copolymer in 1 mL of water, and it was stirred
at room temperature. Then, we fixed the pyrene concentration at 0.2
μM and varied the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI concentrations
from 0.01 to 0.2 mg/mL. We set the excitation wavelength at 339 nm
and monitored the emission intensities at 371, 382, and 396 nm. We
varied the relative emission fluorescence intensities at 396/371 nm
with respect to copolymer concentrations. The value of the CAC was
calculated from the copolymer concentration where the ratio of relative
fluorescence intensity started to vary. We observed the CAC at 180
μg/mL.

Figure 4 (a) Plot of the concentration of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI vs
intensity ratio of emissions at 371 and 396 nm from pyrene. The observed
critical aggregation concentration (CAC) was 180 μg/mL. (b)
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI measured
in aqueous solution. The size of the aggregate was about 104 nm with
PDI = 0.26.

Next, we wanted to determine
the size of the nanoaggregate. For
this purpose, we dissolved 1 mg of the copolymer in 1 mL of water
and stirred for 30 min. Then, 2.5 mL of the aliquot was taken from
the solution, and DLS analysis was carried out to determine the particle
size (Figure 4b). The
radius of the aggregate was about 104 nm with PDI = 0.26. The morphology
of the aggregate was obtained by SEM (Figure 5e,f) and TEM analysis. From the SEM studies,
it was observed that PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI in a polar medium
produced a vesicle-type structure. The observed vesicular morphology
was further supported by TEM analysis. The diameter of these aggregates
was about 200 nm which was in accordance with the result obtained
from DLS. Both SEM and TEM images revealed a uniform vesicular shape.

image, (f) cryo-SEM images, and (g) cartoon representation of the
self-assembly of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI in phosphate buffer.

Next, the stimuli responsiveness
of the delivery vehicle was investigated
at varying pH. For the in vitro drug release study of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, the dialysis experiment was carried out at pH 7.4, 6.5, and 5.
Towards this goal, the copolymer PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI (1 mg)
was dissolved in phosphate buffer solution (1 mL) followed by loading
in a dialysis tube (3500 Da cutoff). The solution was then dialyzed
against 80 mL of buffer solution at pH 5 by gentle stirring. An aliquot
was taken from the sample, and absorbance was measured at 480 nm,
which indicated the release of DOXI (Figure 6). The fluorescence spectrum of each aliquot
was also recorded at an excitation wavelength of 510 nm (Figure S17). Emissions from the free drug were
monitored at the wavelengths 560 and 588 nm. Then, the aliquot was
added back to the solution to keep the volume consistent. A similar
measurement was carried out every 1 h and continued for 48 h. After
10 h, the increase in the fluorescence intensity was not significant.
The release profile of the drug at pH 6.5 and 7.4 was monitored by
the same procedure. The DOXI release from PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI at pH 7.4 was around 4%, which clearly indicated that the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI copolymer was stable in physiological media.
Interestingly, we observed the maximum drug release in an acidic environment
with respect to pH 7.4, anticipating the usefulness of incorporating
the acylhydrazine linker into the polymer backbone.

release profiles of PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI at 37 °C at pH
values of 5, 6.5, and 7.4.

The presence of a disulfide linkage between PCL and the PEG
moiety
makes the copolymer reductively degradable. The disulfide bond can
be cleaved by the reducing agents GSH and DTT. For the investigation
of the redox responsiveness, the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI copolymer
was treated with 10 mM GSH (intracellular GSH concentration of tumor
cells). The particle sizes were monitored by DLS at regular time intervals.
The average diameter of GSH-treated copolymers increased immediately,
to 1000 nm within 10 min (Figure 7a). The rapid change of aggregate size in the presence
of GSH could be attributed to the rupture of disulphide bonds, which
resulted in the destabilization of vesicular architecture. We hypothesized
that the increase in the size was due to the breaking of the polymer
chains via disulfide bonds followed by the recombination of the chains.
However, when PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI copolymer was not treated with GSH, a change
in the size of aggregates was not observed, which supported our hypothesis.
Further, no change in the size of the aggregates also suggested the
stability of the copolymer under physiological conditions. The disruption
of the self-assembled aggregates with response to GSH confirmed our
proposal of increased biodegradability of the polymeric backbone inside
of the cell.

Figure 7 (a) Variation of the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanoparticle
size in the presence of 10 mM GSH and the control determined by DLS
and (b) GPC traces of PEG-SS-PCL before (red curve) and after (green curve) 10 mM DTT treatment.

Next, we investigated the degradation
of the copolymer by GPC analysis. Figure 7b shows how the molecular
weight of the PEG-SS-PCL changed after DTT treatment
in THF. As represented in Figure 7b, the copolymer peak shifted to a higher retention
time, indicating the successful degradation of PEG-SS-PCL into smaller fragments represented by three peaks with different
intensities. This disaggregation was further confirmed by SEM analysis,
which showed the disruption of the self-assembled morphology (Figure S16).

For cellular uptake analysis,
free DOXI (Figure 8) and the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI (Figure 9) nanocarrier with
MCF-7 cells were cultured in 24 well plates at an initial concentration
of 2.5 × 105 cells per well for 24 h in a MEM (minimum
essential medium) at 37 °C. Next, cells were treated with free
DOXI and the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanocarrier having drug
concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL at 37 °C for 24
h. After incubation, cover slips were washed with 1× PBS, fixed
using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and then mounted on a slide. Microscopic
observations were carried out by epifluorescence microscopy. From
the cellular uptake studies, it was observed that both free DOXI and
the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanocarrier entered into cells with
increased concentrations (25, 50, and 100 μg/mL).

DOXI.

cell line with PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI .

From the cytotoxicity
assay results, the free DOXI viability was
more from the 25 to 500 μg/mL compared with that of the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanocarrier (Figure 10). However, the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanocarrier showed a gradual change in cell viability, which implied
the sustained and well-controlled release property for drug delivery
applications.

Figure 10 Cytotoxicity assay of the MCF-7 cell line with free DOXI
vs PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI.

Flow cytometry results (Figure 11) indicated that the mean fluorescence intensities
of free DOXI and the PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI nanocarrier were
449.63 and 421.99 in 50 μg/mL concentration and 654.9 and 620.33
in 100 μg/mL concentration, respectively (Figures 12 and 13). In 50 μg/mL concentration, the fold changes were 5.64 and
5.29 for the free DOXI and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, respectively.
However, in the case of 100 μg/mL concentration, the fold changes
were 8.21 and 7.78 for the free DOXI and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, respectively (Figure 14).

line with

Figure 14 Fold-change analysis of free DOXI and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI.

From the flow cytometry result,
it was evident that the mean fluorescence
intensity and fold change for both free DOXI and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI were almost the same. From the comparative biological experiments
of free DOXI and PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, it was obvious to note
that free DOXI showed effective killing of cancer cells over PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI. However, free DOXI did not have the capability
to reach the cancer cell site specifically. Because of this, the great
side effect in normal cells was not taken care.47−51 It was very interesting to note that the nanocarrier
disrupted through the S–S linker only in the cancer cell because
of the presence of GSH. Also, the presence of the acylhydrazine linker
demonstrated the sustained release of DOXI at the cancer site. Overall,
the newly developed PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI demonstrated the
efficiency in reaching the cancer cell site specifically and releasing
the drug in a sustained fashion.

Conclusions
This
article describes the efficacious synthesis of the copolymer PEG-SS-PCL-DOXI, which serves as an efficient nanocarrier,
releasing the drug in stimuli-responsive sustained fashion. Because
of the inherent amphiphilicity, this nanovehicle self-assembled into
a vesicular architecture, which is well supported by SEM and TEM studies.
Interestingly, we have effectively conjugated DOXI to the biodegradable
caprolactone backbone via the acid-sensitive acylhydrazine linker.
This has facilitated the well-controlled and pH-responsive drug release
under an acidic environment. Cell viability studies clearly show the
efficient internalization of the nanocarrier into the tumor cells
because of the biodegradability present in the backbone. It is our
belief that this newly designed copolymer possesses all of the prospects
of an efficient nanocarrier for the effective cancer treatment.
