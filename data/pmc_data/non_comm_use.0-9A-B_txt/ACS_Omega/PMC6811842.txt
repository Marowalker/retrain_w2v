We
present the optical sensing of phthalate esters (PAEs), a group of
endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The sensing takes place as changes
in the fluorescence emission intensity of aminopyrene covalently bound
to the organic ligands of the metal–organic framework compound
ZIF-8. In the presence of PAEs, a quenching of the fluorescence emission
is observed. We evaluated strategies to engineer colloidal size distribution
of the sensing particles to optimize the sensory response to PAEs.
A thorough characterization of the modified ZIF-8 nanoparticles included
powder X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, high-performance
liquid chromatography, and photophysical characterization. The presented
capability of the fluorophore-functionalized ZIF-8 to sense PAEs complements
established methods such as chromatography-based procedures, which
cannot be used on-site and paves the way for future developments such
as hand-held quick sensing devices.

Introduction
Endocrine-disrupting
chemicals are substances that disturb the hormonal balance in complex
biological life forms.1 Increased levels
of phthalates are associated with severe consequences in the developmental
biology of children, decreased fertility, increased risk of diabetes,
and increased malignancy of cancer in adults.2 In this context, the development of new sensor systems for phthalates
is of interest since phthalates are widely used in consumer products.
Applications include the use as plasticizers in plastic-made tableware
for children, toys, drinking bottles, and other poly(vinyl chloride)-based
products (e.g., floor cover material),3 to name a few.

Currently, the predominantly used methodology
to test for the presence of phthalates in a given sample requires
advanced analytical methods, for example, techniques such as liquid
chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.4 This technology is immobile, restricting the routine on-site monitoring
of the presence of phthalates to ensure consumer safety. The availability
of a reusable sensor capable of measuring on-site without the requirement
of specialized personnel implies a big advantage for safety and quality
control and would have a considerable economic impact. When developing
a new sensing system, the approach of using a sensor compound dissolved
in the sample implies that the sensor will not be easily recoverable;
therefore, the sensor cannot be reused unless costly separation/regeneration
processes are carried out. Thus, a potentially expensive product is
lost and disposing of the waste may increase costs. The heterogenization
of the chromophore bound to a solid surface offers a big advantage
over direct use of the chromophore in solution, making it easier to
recover from a suspension for its reuse. It also offers a higher number
of possibilities to adapt its use as a sensing device.

Short-chained
phthalates are basically nonpolar substances, with their hydrophobicity
increasing with chain length. Poor solubility in water limits their
analysis in typical quick sensing technologies and especially the
development of antibodies needed for immunoanalytical techniques.
While specific antibodies, as a basis for such formats, could be generated
for short-chained phthalates [dibutylphthalate (DBP)5−7 and dimethylphthalate (DMP8)], it was
not the case for the much more important, long-chained phthalates
[diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and benzylbutylphthalate (BBP)] or their
substitutes, such as diisononyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid.9

In this context, the use of zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
might offer an analytical approach as a support for the sensor moiety.
These MOFs are attractive due to their regular pore size, high porosity,
excellent mechanical stability, tunable surface properties, and their
exceptional chemical and thermal stabilities.10,11 The combination of these features distinguishes ZIFs from many other
MOFs. ZIFs are exceptionally easy to synthesize through precipitation
reactions from aqueous and organic solvents.12 Structurally, ZIFs are grown from imidazolate tetrahedra constructed
by the coordination between metallic cations and imidazolate anions,10,13 where imidazole and imidazole derivative units constitute the bridges
for connecting the metal centers. The pore size and the adsorption
properties of ZIFs can be tailored by changing or chemically modifying
the anionic imidazolate linker.14 The intrinsic
properties of ZIFs have led to their use in a broad range of applications
including sensing,15 catalysis,16 and extraction,17 to name a few. In addition, the known hydrophobicity of some of
these ZIF materials18 makes them suitable
for analyzing the nonpolar phthalates in aqueous solution, preconcentrating
these analytes, thus potentially increasing sensitivity. This effect
has been reported for other MOFs, like MIL-10119 being used for the adsorptive removal of polypropylene
co-polymers.

Among ZIFs, the ZIF-8 is advantageous due to its
properties, especially its high porosity, high hydrothermal stability,
and hydrophobicity. Moreover, their synthesis is inexpensive, straightforward,
and reproducible and they are even commercially available. Using ZIF-8
as a sensor scaffold requires to bind fluorescent pyrene derivatives
to its backbone. Pyrene is known for its ability to form excimers
with aromatic components. The high quantum yield and long fluorescence
lifetime make it an ideal candidate for sensing of aromatic molecules,
which can be seen in some examples such as the work by Rochat et al.
that uses sulfonated water-soluble pyrene derivatives to detect caffeine
in aqueous samples.20 We decided to adapt
this approach as a sensing principle for PAEs, by including an aminopyrene
core in the structure of ZIF-8. The modification for the structure
of ZIF-8 was carried out by combining two methodologies: (i) we include
an imidazole derivative on the ZIF-8 structure with a carboxaldehyde
functionality, which allowed to covalently bind the pyrene core on
the ZIF-8 structure via imine formation condensation and (ii) we applied
a reported methodology to obtain ZIF-8 nanoparticles by adding N-butylamine as a modulating agent during the synthesis
process.21 By combining these processes,
we obtained a nanoparticulated solid MOF capable of performing sensing
against dissolved aromatic analytes of high interest, such as PAEs.

Results
and Discussion
Synthetic Route of Z8P-0.25 to Z8P-5.00 MOFs
To include the pursued functionalization on the structure of ZIF-8,
the original synthesis11 had to be modified.
We used two reported modifications for the standard ZIF-8 synthesis:
(i) the inclusion of 1-metylimidazole and n-butylamine
as modulating agents21 during the formation
of the ZIF to obtain a nanoparticulate MOF and (ii) the inclusion
of the fluorescent chromophore on the structure, via Schiff’s
base condensation between 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde and 1-aminopyrene.

For this second modification, we adapted the methodology reported
by Yaghi et al.,22 in which they functionalize
the organic linkers of ZIF-90 (2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde) postsynthetically
using mild organic reactions, forming ZIF-92. However, in our system
the condensation between 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde and 1-aminopyrene
had to be done prior to the formation of the ZIF. The modulating agent
agent n-butylamine, key for the formation of colloidal
particles of ZIF-8, has an even higher affinity for Schiff’s
base condensation, which leads to a blocking of the 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde
positions and prevents the covalent incorporation of 1-aminopyrene
into the modified ZIF-8 framework. Thus, the condensation between
2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde and 1-aminopyrene had to be done prior to
the formation of the ZIF. After this first reaction, the formation
of the ZIF proceeds, resulting in a nanosized, modified ZIF-8 structure.
The powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the modified ZIF-8 (Z8P)
is similar to that of the unmodified ZIF-8 (Figures 1 and S1a–e;
Supporting Information).

Figure 1 Measured powder diffraction pattern for Z8P-5.00
(blue line) compared to the reflection positions of that of the unmodified
ZIF-8 (red bars).

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images show that the nanoparticles have sizes between
20 and 50 nm in diameter (Supporting Information, Figure S2a–d). The particle size is relevant since
it is a key factor for the reproducibility of the fluorescence measurements,
assuming there are two areas of the particle where the quenching can
happen: (i) on the surface of the particle and (ii) on the inside
of the particles. We hypothesize that each zone causes quenching by
different mechanisms,23 which had to be
proven by the characterization of fluorescence properties. Another
relevant reason for obtaining nanoparticles is the homogeneity of
the resulting suspensions that are stable without further surface
modifications that would otherwise be required.24

Composition of Z8P MOFs via High-performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
To determine the exact proportion
of the imidazole components on the different Z8P-0.25 to Z8P-5 MOFs,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used. An applicable
methodology has been reported by Bennett et al.,25 where HPLC was used to quantify the final composition of
ZIF-62.

To quantify the composition of MOFs Z8P-0.25 to Z8P-5.00,
they had to be digested first. For this purpose, 10 mg of each of
the ZIFs was suspended in 5 mL of the HPLC eluent and 100 μL
of aqueous 1 M solution of HCl was added. The suspended particles
slowly dissolved, forming a clear yellow solution. This solution was
injected into the HPLC system.

Retention times of the starting
materials of Z8P-0.25 to Z8P-5.00 MOFs were recorded (Supporting Information, Figure S3a). Each species showed a single peak
that can be distinguished from the others, except for Z8P-S (the product
of the Schiff base conjugation between 2-imidazolcarboxaldehyde and
1-aminopyrene, Supporting Information, Figure S3b), which showed two peaks corresponding to 1-aminopyrene
and 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde. Further studies by mass spectrometry
(Supporting Information, Figure S3c) proved
that Z8P-S decomposes on aqueous acidic conditions26 into its chemical constituents. For further quantification
of Z8P-S on the different Z8P MOFs, the 1-aminopyrene signal was used
since both constituents have 1:1 stoichiometry on the resulting modified
ZIF.

During the quantification process for the constituents
of Z8P MOFs, we realized that no 1-methylimidazole was present (Figure 2, top). This ligand
was expected to act as a competitive ligand in the coordination sphere
of zinc,21 thus being part of the modified
ZIF structure. However, its absence after digestion suggests that
the ligand acts only as a modulating agent during the synthesis of
Z8P MOFs.

Figure 2 Top: chromatogram for the digested Z8P-5.00 together with the chromatograms
for 1-aminopyrene, 2-methylinidazolecarboxaldehyde, and 2-methylimidazole.
Bottom: chromatograms of the different variants of Z8P.

Table 1 summarizes
initial and measured molar proportions (in mole percent) for each
of the components of the different Z8P MOFs. Results show that an
increase in the initial concentration of the constituents leads to
an increase in the concentration of 1-aminopyrene and imidazolecarboxaldehyde,
allowing to tune the maximum intensity of the fluorescence emission.
This conjugation, however, is not linear (Supporting Information, Figure S3f), yet it was still possible to predict
the final amount of fluorophore on the Z8P MOF, tuning its maximum
fluorescence emission and allowing to synthesize the modified ZIF
with the ideal fluorescence intensity to mass ratio.

Porosity Characterization of Z8P-5.00
Figure 3 shows the adsorption–desorption
isotherms for N2 at −196 °C for Z8P-5.00 and,
for comparison, the nanoparticulate ZIF-8 (ZIF-8 NP). ZIF-8 shows
a type I isotherm corresponding to microporous materials according
to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification.27 Z8P-5.00 shows a type IV isotherm corresponding
to mesoporous materials with an important contribution of adsorption
in micropores. The H1-type hysteresis loop in the desorption branch
of the material Z8P-5.00 indicates the presence of mesopores homogeneous
in shape and size.28 Neither interparticular
adsorption nor hysteresis have been observed for the ZIF-8 NP, matching
the microporous structure of this material. Therefore, the mesopores
found in the sample Z8P-5.00 must be the interparticular volume between
regular-in-size agglomerated nanocrystals, since the crystal phase
is the same in both materials (Figures 1 and S1f; Supporting Information).
The resulting high homogeneity in size and shape of mesopores could
be a consequence of the interaction between chromophore molecules
attached to the external surface of crystals, presumably acting as
regular spacing agents between neighboring nanoparticles.

Figure 3 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196 °C for
materials ZIF-8 NP (blue triangles) and Z8P-5.00 (red squares). Solid
and open symbols correspond to adsorption and desorption branches,
respectively.

A lower amount of adsorbed N2 at low P/P0 indicates
a lower porosity for Z8P-5.00. Table 2 compares the values of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) areas and micropore volumes, corroborating this reduction in
porosity. Also, the apparent density was measured by He expansion,
showing a slightly lower value for the material Z8P-5.00. Considering
the micropore volume and not the total pore volume for the calculation,
the resulting crystals after inclusion of the chromophore moiety have
a higher density and a lower void volume. A larger mean pore size
can be seen for the ZIF-8 NP when compared to that of Z8P-5.00 (Figure S5a in the Supporting Information and Table 2). The estimated values
reasonably agree with the reported data (cavities of 1.2 nm of diameter
connected by windows of 0.36 nm).11 These
differences in the pore size distribution (PSD) and the reduction
in the void volume indicate the presence of some 1-aminopyrene molecules
partially occupying the cavities of Z8P-5.00. Moreover, two pressure-adsorption
steps can be seen on the N2 adsorption isotherm for the
ZIF-8 NP at values lower than 0.05 for P/P0 that do not show for Z8P-5.00 (Figure 3). This behavior has been related
to the rotation of the imidazole molecules in the window of the cage
of the ZIF-8 structure,29 and its absence
in the modified material could be a consequence of the covalent inclusion
of 1-aminopyrene molecules in the modified ZIF-8 structure. We believe
the obtained data are conclusive to prove that the included aminopyrene
functionality is not only on the external surface of the Z8P-5.00
nanocrystals but also inside of the pore cavities.

Spectrometric Characteristics
of Z8P MOFs
The main principle used here to detect and quantify
the presence of PAEs is fluorescence quenching, which is a well-established
methodology.30 In this particular system,
the π–π stacking interactions between the chromophore
(pyrene covalently bound to the modified ZIF structure) and the aromatic
analyte (PAEs) were supposed to be responsible for fluorescence relaxation
leading to quenching.20,31 The fluorescence quenching response
of the system was studied focusing first on the dependency of the
fluorescence for Z8P-5.00 in relation to its concentration (referring
by concentration for Z8P MOFs as the mass of modified ZIF in “g”
dispersed on a volume of methanol in “mL”). In Figure 4, the intensity increases
as the concentration increases to 0.4 g·L–1, then reaching a plateau. Since a modified ZIF concentration of
0.2 g·L–1 showed the beginning of the plateau,
this is the range of concentrations for the modified ZIF that was
chosen for the rest of the experiments.

Figure 4 Fluorescence emission
for Z8P-5.00 at different concentrations (from 0.00 to 0.4 g·L–1). The intensity was taken from the emission maximum
at 433 nm. The excitation wavelength was 277 nm. Each point was measured
three times and the average results were plotted.

Sensing with Z8P MOFs: Quantification of Four Different PAEs
The quenching of the fluorescence as a function of the concentration
of PAEs was studied. Three Z8P-5.00 concentrations were chosen (0.20,
0.15, and 0.10 g·L–1) and applied in the sensing
of DMP in a concentration range from 0.00 to 2.00 g·L–1. At low PAE concentrations, the quenching is not very pronounced.
However, with increasing concentrations, saturation for the quenching
is reached (Figure S4a, Supporting Information).
Interestingly, in the chosen concentration range, a dependency on
the Z8P-5.00 concentration could not be found. The effect of quenching
is independent of the concentration for the sensing element within
the concentration that was investigated (Supporting Information, Figure S4a).

When the fluorescence is tested
in relation to the PAE concentration, a direct dependency between
the loss in fluorescence emission intensity and the increase in the
concentration of the analyte is observed (Figure 5). This is due to the quenching in fluorescence
generated when the PAEs are near the covalently bound pyrene cores.
Focusing on 0.20 g·L–1 for Z8P-5.00 and taking
the intensity at the emission maximum at 430 nm for each concentration,
a calibration curve was generated. The relation between fluorescence
intensity and concentration for DMP proved to be nonlinear (Supporting
Information, Figure S4b,c). Therefore,
we applied the Stern–Volmer equation (eq 1) for collisional fluorescence quenching23 to establish a functional relationship 1  where F0 is the fluorescence intensity for Z8P-5.00
with no quencher in the solution, FQ is
the fluorescence intensity for Z8P-5.00 in the presence of “Q”
g·L–1 of DMP in solution, and KD is the Stern–Volmer quenching constant for the
system. We assumed collisional quenching to be predominant over static
quenching because the interaction between the fluorophore on Z8P-5.00
and the analyte is a soft and reversible π–π stacking.

From the shape of the fitting (Supporting Information, Figure S4b), we can see that the assumption that
there is only contribution from collisional quenching is wrong. It
must be considered that there is also static quenching during the
sensing process. Considering that it is highly unlikely that both
the covalently bound aminopyrene and the analytes (phthalates molecules)
can both fit at the same time inside the pore of the modified ZIF-8
and interact via π–π interaction and given the
relative sizes of the molecules and the pore size of ZIF-8, it should
be assumed that the sensing takes place on the surface of the nanoparticle,
with a very small contribution by the inside of the particle, generating
a small static contribution to the quenching of the fluorescence.

With both static and dynamic quenching, a modified version of the
Stern–Volmer equation that includes both contributions can
be chosen 2   3  where KS is the association constant of the fluorophore–quencher complex.
Applying this model, a very good fitting of the data is obtained (Figure 6). The resulting
calibration curve can be used to determine the concentration of all
PAEs in the samples. The curve for the other PAEs (DBP, BBP, and DEHP)
can be found in the Supporting Information, Figure S4d–f. The behavior of all chosen PAEs is very similar
for DMP, DBP, and BBP, implying that there is no significant difference
in the quenching process. DEHP shows a significant deviation from
the rest. However, it seems possible to determine the sum of the concentration
of a mixture of all of these species in a sample with high reliability.

Figure 5 Fluorescence
quenching measured with a fixed concentration of Z8P-5.00 (0.2 g·L–1) is suspended in different solutions with varying
concentrations of DMP (from 0.00, highest intensity curve, to 0.1
g·L–1, lowest intensity curve). The excitation
wavelength was 277 nm.

Figure 6 Modified Stern–Volmer
fitting for the fluorescence quenching of Z8P-5.00 at different DMP
concentrations (from 0.00 to 2.00 g·L–1). The
excitation wavelength was 277 nm, and the emission maximum was recorded
at 430 nm. Each point was measured three times.

We also calculated the limits of detection (LODs) from the obtained
data.32 The LODs range from 0.013 to 0.039
g·L–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S4f). For comparison, the most common
methodology for the detection of phthalates to date is gas chromatography,
and the reported LODs33 are in the range
of 0.006–0.17 μg·L–1. The presented
methodology clearly cannot compete with chromatography as a quantification
method for very low concentrations, but this is not the objective
of this application. Instead, we propose it as a complementary methodology
for frequent surveys and/or in situ quantification and as the first
step for a cheap and easy-to-use alternative, potentially a process
analytical sensor in phthalates’ production.

Conclusions
Modified ZIF-8 fluorescent MOF nanoparticles were synthesized with
a distribution ranging between 20 and 50 nm in diameter, with the
synthesis showing a high reproducibility. We have shown an easy synthetic
route and how to tune the fluorescence of the modified ZIF, by varying
the amount of pyrene derivative added to the ZIF-8 structure. HPLC
quantification of the modified ZIF constituents was able to prove
that the initial stoichiometry of the synthesis proportion influences
the final composition of the modified ZIF.

Fluorescence studies
resulted in concentration/signal relationships for all of the chosen
analytes, four phthalate esters. A modified Stern–Volmer model
fitted perfectly the calibration relationship. We proved that this
modified ZIF-8 is a good first step towards the development of a cheap
and easy-to-use device to detect the presence of PAEs. The selectivity
of the system relies mostly on the sample type and pretreatment since
small aromatic molecules will most likely interfere with the quenching.
However, if the pretreatment of the sample is adequate, this modified
ZIF could be part of a continuous and cost-effective surveillance
system, applicable to wastewaters from industrial production, for
example.

Experimental Section
Reagents
The PAEs were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich: dimethylphthalate ≥99% (DMP), dibutylphthalate
99% (DBP), benzylbutylphthalate 98% (BBP), and diethylhexylphthalate
≥99.5% (DEHP).

Zinc nitrate hexahydrate ≥99% was
bought from Roth; 2-methylimidazol 99% (2-MeImi) was from Acros Organics;
1-methylimidazol 99% (1-MeImi) was obtained from Fluorochem; n-butylamine 99.5%, 1-aminopyrene 97% (1-AmiPyr), and 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde
97% (2-ImiCarb) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Preparation
of the 1-aminopyrene-functionalized ZIF-8 nanoparticles (Z8P-0.25
to Z8P-5.00). Samples with different ratios of 2-imidazolcarboxaldehyde
and 1-aminopyrene (see Table 3) were dissolved in 7.5 mL of methanol in a sealed glass flask,
and then heated to 90 °C for 30 min. Afterward, 146 μL
of n-butylamine (2.700 mmol) was added to the mix
and stirred for 10 min. After cooling to ambient temperature, a varying
amount of 2-methylimidazole and 1-methylimidazole was added to the
mix. Finally, a methanolic solution (12 mL) with 112 mg (0.377 mmol)
of Zn(NO3)2 and 6H2O was added to
the mix. Almost immediately, a yellow precipitate appeared suspended
in the solution. The mixture was left undisturbed for 8 h. The solid
was extracted via centrifugation, washed three times with methanol,
and dried at room temperature at ambient pressure. The nomenclature
used here for each of the modified ZIFs is in reference to the molar
percentage of the 1-aminopyrene for their synthesis.

Methods
Powder X-ray Diffractometry
Powder X-ray diffractometry patterns were collected with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.50406 nm) on a D8 Advanced diffractometer (Bruker
AXS, Germany) equipped with a Lynxeye detector. Samples were measured
in reflection geometry in a 2θ range from 4 to 60° with
a step size of 0.009°.

Fluorescence spectra were obtained on an all-in-one microplate
reader Synergy H1 with dispenser (BioTek). The software used was Gen5.
The spectra were acquired from 380 to 600 nm, with a step of 2 nm,
the measurement time of 10 ms, and the delay between measurements
of 100 ms. The samples were handled in a polypropylene 96-well black
plate from Greiner Bio-One.

HPLC–UV
The HPLC measurements were performed on a SECurity GPC System (PSS
GmbH) with a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC 3.5 μm, 100 Å sorbent, Peek
150 × 4.6 mm2 metal-free HPLC column (di2chrom/Merck).
The autosampler and column were operated at 35 °C. UV absorption
at a wavelength of 230 nm was recorded. The mobile phase was a mixture
of 65% acetonitrile and 35% H2O, containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid. The injected volume was 5 μL. The flow rate was 1 mL·min–1. The samples were dissolved in the mobile phase mixture.
HPLC/MS grade solvents (Honeywell, Riedel-dee-Haën) were used.

Mass Spectrometry Measurements
The mass spectrometric measurements
were performed on a Q-TOF Ultima ESI-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass),
operating in positive ion mode at a capillary voltage of 2–3
kV, a cone voltage of 35 V, and collision energy of 5 eV. The source
temperature was 120 °C and the desolvation temperature was 150
°C.

TEM Measurements
TEM measurements
were performed on a ThermoFisher Scientific Talos F200S 200 kV scanning/transmission
electron microscope, using a copper ultra-thin C film on Lacey Carbon
support film with a 400 mesh.

N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Experiments at −196 °C
N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms were measured at 77 K on a volumetric ASAP 2020 device (Micromeritics)
in the range of relative pressures P/P0 from 10–7 to 0.996. For analysis,
0.3 g of each material was loaded in the analysis probe, followed
by thermal activation at 160 °C for 18 h under a minimum vacuum
pressure below 10–6 mbar. The warm and cold free
spaces were estimated after He expansion after the N2 experiment.
BET area was calculated by following Rouquerol and Llewellyn’s
rule for the selection of the optimal BET range.27 Pore size distribution (PSD) and micropore volume were
estimated by nonlocal density functional theory (NL-DFT) by Microactive
5.01 software. The used model kernel was that for cylindrical pore
geometry “N2 Tarazona NL-DFT, Esf = 30.0 K”,
according to the best fitting of data (see Figure S5b,c in the Supporting Information) and the comparison of
results with the reported crystallographic information for the ZIF-8
structure.11 The micropore volume was assumed
as the corresponding cumulative pore volume for pore sizes of 22 Å.

Sample Density
Apparent sample density was measured by comparing
the free-space measurement of the occupied analysis cell with the
sample with the empty analysis cell in a Sieverts-like apparatus (Micromeritics
HPVA II). It was measured at the beginning of the analysis by He expansion
at ambient temperature in 40 repetitions with intermediate evacuation
for 20 min. Gas density was calculated from P and T values by using the modified Benedict–Webb–Rubin
equation of state for Helium of McCarty and Arp, as recommended by
National Institute of Standards and Technology.34 The room temperature where the device is located is stable
within ±1 °C, and the manifold temperature is constant at
32–33 °C. The value of the free space of the empty analysis
cell was averaged from 100 measurements, and the accuracy and linearity
of the free volume measurements for solid samples were checked by
calibration with different amounts of a nonporous SiO2 reference
material CRM BAM-PM-101, whose density was previously certified by
BAM. According to this calibration, each measurement of the sample
volume herein has an accuracy of 96–98% for an occupancy of
the analysis cell free volume from 5 to 70%, respectively. In a typical
experiment, 0.5–0.7 g of fresh material were loaded in the
analysis cell, whose empty weight was considered as an average value
of 100 measurements. Before analysis, samples were degassed at 160
°C for 18 h at dynamic high vacuum (pressure lower than 10–6 mbar). Crystal density (ρcr) and
the void volume fraction were calculated from the apparent sample
density (ρsk) and the micropore volume (vμpore) by using eqs 4 and 5, respectively. 4   5
