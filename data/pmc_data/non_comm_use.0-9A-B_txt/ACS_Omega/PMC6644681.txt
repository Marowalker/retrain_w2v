A highly concise
bioinspired four-step total synthesis of yaoshanenolides
A and B possessing tricyclic spirolactone with an unusual 5′H-spiro-[bicyclo[2.2.2]-oct[2]ene-7,2′-furan]-5′-one
scaffold is reported. This synthesis features high-yielding aldol-type
addition of γ-butyrolactone on to the aldehyde, exocyclic olefination
of lactone derivative using Eschenmoser’s salt, and highly
facial- and endo-selective [4 + 2]-cycloaddition of fully functionalized
5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone with natural R-(−)-α-phellandrene. The approach allows access to yaoshanenolides
A and B in four linear steps in 11 and 13% overall yield.

Introduction
Natural
products have been an exceptional source of small molecules
for drug discovery. In the human history, plants and animal-derived
natural products have found direct applications in almost all traditional
medical preparations. In modern drug discovery, they are continuously
entering clinical trials and also have provided leads for new drugs.1 However, a unique problem associated with the
development of natural product-based drugs are the difficulty to access
sufficient quantities of compounds required for comprehensive biochemical
investigations and marketing purposes. This is because of the isolation
of the natural product in limited quantities and also the stereochemical
complexity of their chemical structures that make their synthesis
in quantitative amounts challenging.2 Hence,
there is a need to develop short and high-yielding practical synthetic
routes, either with existing or through the development of new chemical
technologies.2 In our journey with the
above perspective and inspired by interesting structural features
and anticancer activities of yaoshanenolides A (1) and
B (2), we have developed the shortest route for their
synthesis.

Recently, in the year 2012, Lin and Shi’s
group isolated
two novel tricyclic spirolactones yaoshanenolides A (1) and B (2) possessing unprecedented 5′H-spiro-[bicyclo[2.2.2]-oct[2]ene-7,2′-furan]-5′-one
scaffold and homologous alkyl side chain from the stem bark of Machilus yaoshansis.3 Several
plants of this genus (Lauraceae family)
have been known to produce arrays of secondary metabolites with significant
biological profiles and have been extensively used as traditional
folk medicine in China.4 In addition to
this ethnic usage of the plant, compounds 1 and 2 showed significant cytotoxic activities against several
human cancer cell lines (A549) with IC50 values of 5.1–6.6
μM.3 The relative stereochemistry
of yaoshanenolides A and B (8 and 9, proposed
structures) was tentatively established based on 2D NMR analysis,
and the (S) absolute stereochemistry of the secondary
hydroxyl functionality was deduced using the bulkiness rule for the
Rh2(OCOCF3)4-induced circular dichroism
analysis. In addition, they proposed a biosynthetic pathway, comprising
the Diels–Alder reaction of suitable obtusilactones (3–6) and unnatural α-(+)-phellandrene (7) to afford both natural products (8 and 9), among which the structure of the compound 9 was revised recently (vide infra) (Scheme 1).3

Scheme 1 Revised
and Proposed Structures and the Biosynthetic Pathway of Yaoshanenolides
A and B
Soon after the isolation,
Singh research group accomplished the
tricyclic spirolactone core of yaoshanenolides in a 10-step linear
synthesis, using their in-house protocol of cycloaddition of reactive
spiroepoxycylohexa-2,4-dienone with ethyl acrylate.5 In 2016, Stratakis’s group reported a highly expedient
first total synthesis and structural revision of (+)-yaoshanenolide
B (2) via the Diels–Alder reaction between R-(−)-α-phellandrene and 5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone derivative in 8 steps and 6.2% overall yield.6

Results and Discussion
As described
in the retrosynthetic analysis in Scheme 2, we have designed two unified
approaches to access both natural products 1 and 2. In the first approach, we envisioned that 1 and 2 could be accessed from tricyclic spirolactone 10 via Morita–Baylis–Hillman coupling with a
suitable commercially available aldehyde. The lactone 10 could be readily prepared through the Diels–Alder reaction
between known 5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone (protoanemonin)
(11) and R-(−)-α-phellandrene
(12). The oxidation of 2-methylfuran (13) followed by dehydration could deliver the desired dienophile 11. In contrast, the second approach uses the fully functionalized
5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone derivative (±)-14 as the dienophile, which would be obtained from commercially
available γ-butyrolactone (15) (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Retrosynthetic Analysis
of Two Unified Strategies for Yaoshanenolides
A (1) and B (2)
Our first approach to (+)-yaoshanenolide B (2) is
outlined in Scheme 3. Oxidation of 2-methylfuran (13) using Pinnick’s
conditions (NaClO2 and NaH2PO4) gave
5-hydroxy-5-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (16), which was immediately subjected to P2O5-mediated
dehydration reaction to furnish 5-methylene-2(5H)-furanone
(11) in 71% yield (for two steps).7 Next, the Diels–Alder cycloaddition between dienophile 11 and natural R-(−)-α-phellandrene
(12) under known reaction conditions8 of toluene, 110 °C for 12 h, afforded tricyclic spirolactone
adducts 10a (endo, less polar) and 10b (exo,
more polar) together with negligible quantities of their regio-isomers.
Even though this transformation was reported earlier, no clear analytical
data were available to establish the structures of 10a and 10b.8 Hence, we carried
out a systematic 2D NMR (COSY, HMBC, HSQC, and NOESY) analysis of
these two compounds. The HSQC data established all 1J1H–13C connectivities;
the remaining skeletal connectivities were confirmed particularly
by COSY and HMBC data (Figure 1). The complete stereochemistry of 10a and 10b was established by the examination of their NOESY data
and the known absolute configuration of 12. In the case
of adduct 10a, strong nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)
correlations of H-6 with H-1/H-9/H3-10/H3-12/H-3′
and H-1 with H-3′/H-6 confirmed the endo- and 1R,2R,4R,7R stereochemistry.
In the case of adduct 10b, correlations of H-5 with H-4/H3-12/H-9/H3-11, H-1 with H-7, and H-3′ with
H-8 confirmed its exo- and 1S,2R,4R,8R stereochemistry (Figure 1).a

Scheme 3 Unsuccessful First
Synthetic Approach to (+)-Yaoshanenolide B (2)
After establishing the structures
of both adducts 10a and 10b, we turned our
attention to executing the final
Morita–Baylis–Hillman9 coupling
between endo-adduct 10a and 1-dodecanal (17), which was expected to furnish the desired natural product 2 and its C1″-epimer 2a. Unfortunately,
this coupling reaction using several reported procedures (DABCO; TMEDA,
MgI2; TEA; DMAP; LiClO4, DABCO; imidazole; TiCl4; or n-Bu2BOTf)10a−10i proved to be insurmountable, and in all cases, the starting adduct 10a remained unreactive and fully recovered (Table S1).a In addition to this, we
planned a roundabout process (Scheme 3), where the α,β-unsaturated double bond
in lactone segment of 10a was selectively reduced using
Mg–MeOH11 to give the corresponding
tricyclic spirolactone, which was subsequently converted into diastereomeric
α-phenylselanyl derivative (18 and 18a). Then, the generation of lithium enolate of lactone 18 or 18a using LDA followed by its addition to the aldehyde 17 was unsuccessful and led to the decomposition. Thus, we
have abandoned this strategy and proceeded to the second approach
(Scheme 3).

In
our second approach, first, the total synthesis of (+)-yaoshanenolide
B (2) was planned, which would allow us to compare and
confirm the stereochemical outcome with respect to its proposed3 and revised6 structures.
Thus, racemic dienophile 14a was prepared from γ-butyrolactone
(15) in three steps (by a modification of Queneau’s
procedure13). LiHMDS- and TMSCl-mediated
phenylselenation of 15 gave the α-phenylselanyl
intermediate 19 in 79% yield. The addition of lithium
enolate of 19 onto the 1-dodecanal (17),
followed by immediate oxidative elimination of phenyl selenenic acid
using H2O2, delivered the hydroxy-alkyl tethered
α-β-unsaturated lactone 21 in 81% yield.12 Then, exocyclic olefination of 21 using LDA and Eschenmoser’s salt gave the desired dienophile 14a in 52% yield.13 On the basis
of the earlier report,3 the [4 + 2]-cycloaddition
reaction between fully functionalized dienophile 14a and R-(−)-α-phellandrene (12) was
expected to be challenging because of the labile hydroxyl group in 14a (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Total Synthesis of (+)-Yaoshanenolides B (2),
Its C1″-Epimer
(2a), and Exo-Isomers (2′ and 2a′)
Hence, we were inquisitive to verify the feasibility of
this transformation.
To our delight, this key cycloaddition between 14a and 12 in toluene at 110 °C for 20 h furnished (+)-yaoshanenolide-B
(2, more polar) and its C1″-epimer 2a (less polar) in 1:1 ratio with high facial and regio-selectivity
in a good yield of 75%. To our surprise, respective exo-isomers (2′ and 2a′) were detected in small
amounts (in ∼93:7 endo/exo ratio), and we did not observe any
other products among a total of 16 isomers (from two diastereotopic
faces of the (±)-14 (dienophile) and the unsymmetrical
diene (12) each) possible in this reaction (Scheme 4). Utilizing the
same strategy (+)-yaoshanenolide A (1, more polar) and
its C1″-epimer 1a (less polar) in 1:1 ratio was
accomplished for the first time using 1-tetradecanal (20) in step 2 (19 → 22 → 14b → 1 and 1a; Schemes 4 and 5). Even after much effort, we were unable to designate exo
isomers of yaoshanenolides A and B (2′ and 2a′ and 1′ and 1a′) through NMR analyses, which could be due to their presence in lower
quantities. Hence, we have prepared authentic samples using Stratakis’s
protocol6 of Diels–Alder reaction
between acetate-protected dienophile 14a′ and R-(−)-α-phellandrene (12) followed
by acetate deprotection and assigned endo/exo ratios based on reported
results6 and analogy (through careful 1H NMR analyses, see the Supporting Information for details).

Scheme 5 Total Synthesis of (+)-Yaoshanenolides A (1), Its C1″-Epimer
(1a), and Exo-Isomers (1′ and 1a′)
Even though compounds 1, 1a, 2, and 2a were clearly separable by silica gel
column
chromatography and the specific rotation data of 1, 2, and 2a are very close to reported values,
we were unable to completely assign their structures at this stage
because of their indistinguishable 1H and 13C NMR spectral data. Hence, we established structures through 2D
NMR analysis (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC).a The NOESY
analysis of 1, 2, 1a, and 2a showed a similar correlation of H-3′ with H-1/H-6,
H-1 with H-6/H-7/H-9/H3-10, and H-6 with H3-12/H-9/H3-10, which confirmed their endo-stereochemistry. In addition,
the absolute stereochemistry of the secondary hydroxyl functionality
was assigned through the synthesis of corresponding MPA esters using
(S)-MPA and compared relative proton chemical shifts
with that of reported data.6 On the basis
of the above analysis and known absolute stereochemistry of 12, complete structures of both natural products yaoshanenolide
A ((1R,2S,4R,7R,1″S)-1) and B ((1R,2S,4R,7R,1″S)-2) and their C1″-epimers
((1R,2S,4R,7R,1″R)-1a and (1R,2S,4R,7R,1″R)-2a) were established (Figure 2 and Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Synthesis of MPA Esters of (+)-Yaoshanenolides
A (1)
and B (2) and Their C1″-Epimers (1a and 2a)
To understand and rationalize this remarkable face and
regio-selectivity,
we have drawn four most prominent transition states using the (S)-enantiomer of the dienophile 14a that is
approaching the less hindered face of the (R)-α-phellandrene
(12) among a total of eight possible transition states
(Scheme 7). The Re
or Si face of the exocyclic double bond of the dienophile (S)-14a approaching the less hindered face of
the diene (12) in an endo fashion provides two transition
states (TS-A and TS-B); in a similar fashion
providing two more exo-transition states is also possible (TS-C and TS-D). In addition to these four transition states,
two exo and two endo transition states can arise through the approach
of the dienophile (S)-14a toward the
more hindered face of the diene 12, these transition
states could be highly energetic due to the unfavorable severe steric
interactions between isopropyl group of the diene 12 and
dienophile (S)-14a; hence, we have excluded
those transition states in this discussion. In the case of TS-A, the less hindered face of the (R)-α-phellandrene
(12) approaches the Si face of the double bond of the
dienophile (S)-14a in an endo fashion,
which leads to the formation of corresponding natural product (+)-yaoshanenolide
B (2). Another possible endo transition state (TS-B) involving the Re face of the double bond of the dienophile
(S)-14a develops significant steric
interactions between the vinylic methyl group of diene 12 and the hydroxyl functionality of the dienophile (S)-14a (Scheme 7).

Scheme 7 Possible Transition States in the Diels–Alder
Reaction of
(S)-14a and the Less Hindered Face of
(R)-α-Phellandrene (12)
In other possible two exo approaches
with any facial orientation
of the dienophile (S)-14a (either Si
or Re face), molecular models revealed that no significant steric
interactions develop between the isopropyl group of the (R)-α-phellandrene (12) and dienophile (S)-14a; this observation is in contrast with
that of Stratakis’s report6 (Scheme 7). In spite of negligible
steric interactions in the case of exo transition states (TS-C and TS-D), TS-C gave corresponding exo
adduct 2′ as a minor product, whereas TS-D failed to furnish the corresponding exo adducts 2c.
Among two possible endo adducts 2 and 2b via TS-A and TS-B, respectively, adduct 2 only formed via TS-A and TS-B failed
to deliver the adduct 2b because of steric interactions
(Scheme 7).

To
further understand the observed endo selectivity, we compared
the stereochemical outcome of the Diels–Alder reaction of dienophiles 11, 14a′, and 14a with diene 12 through TS-A and TS-C (Scheme 8). The unsubstituted
dienophile 11 furnished almost equal amounts of endo
and exo adducts 10a and 10b (eq 1), whereas
the dienophile 14a′ (possessing acetate derived
alkyl chain), which was used in Stratakis’s work, gave endo
and exo adducts in 3:1 ratio (eq 2). In contrast to these results,
dienophile 14a possessing free hydroxy tethered alkyl
chain furnished the endo (2) and exo (2′) adducts in ∼93:7 ratio (eq 3). On the basis of these observations,
we assume that the endo-rule is governing the stereochemical outcome
and also there is an inherent role of the side chain with the free
hydroxyl group in stabilizing the endo transition state (TS-A). However, the establishment of the precise reaction pathway requires
further mechanistic investigations.

Endo Selectivity in Diels–Alder Reaction
of (R)-α-Phellandrene (12) and
Differently Substituted Dienophiles (11, 14a′, 14a) through TS-A (Endo, Si-Face)
Conclusion
In
summary, (+)-yaoshanenolides A and B were prepared in four linear
steps from commercially available and affordable starting materials
with remarkable face- and endo-selectivity, and an overall yield of
11 and 13%, a marked improvement over existing synthesis. The absolute
stereochemistry of (+)-yaoshanenolides A and B and their epimers and
the Diels–Alder product of protoanemonin and R-(−)-α-phellandrene were established by extensive NMR
analysis. This highly concise and efficient route enables the synthesis
of yaoshanenolides and their analogs in good quantities and provides
a means to further investigate the biological profile. Our studies
in this direction are in progress and will be published in due course.

5-Methylenefuran-2(5H)-one (11)
To a solution of 2-methylfuran
(13) (1 g,
12.18 mmol) in t-BuOH (36 mL) and H2O
(6 mL) was added monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate (2.1 g, 18.27
mmol) followed by sodium chlorite (3.3 g, 36.54 mmol) at 0 °C
and allowed it to reach room temperature (rt) slowly. (Caution: After a brief initiation period of 1–2 min, the reaction
mixture turned into a bright yellow/orange color and began to be exothermic,
hence to be allowed to reach rt very slowly in 2–3 h). The
reaction mixture was then transferred to a separatory funnel, and
the aqueous layer and salts were drained. The t-BuOH
layer was then collected, concentrated under reduced pressure to afford
5-hydroxy-5-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (16) TLC: Rf = 0.65 (SiO2, 10%
CH2Cl2/MeOH); the crude product is subjected
to next step without further purification. A suspension of crude 5-hydroxy-5-methylfuran-2(5H)-one (16) and P2O5 (10.29
g, 36.27 mmol) in benzene (30 mL) was refluxed for 5 h. The mixture
was filtered through Celite, and the residue was washed with benzene
(2 × 20 mL). The organic layer was concentrated under vacuo and
the obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography

12 h. After complete consumption of 11, the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. The residue was carefully purified
by silica gel column chromatography (SiO2, 2% EtOAc/hexanes)
to afford the endo-(10a) (0.34 g, 35%)
and exo-(11a) (0.34 g, 35%) isomers,
along with trace amount of inseparable regio-isomer TLC: Rf = 0.3 and 0.2 (SiO2, 10% EtOAc/hexanes).

was continued for 1 h followed by addition of Eschenmoser’s
salt (3.49 g, 18.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h
and then allowed to warm to rt and stirred for 15 h. The reaction
mixture was poured into saturated ammonium chloride solution (5 mL)
and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The organic phase
extracted was washed with water and brine and dried over anhydrous
sodium sulphate, filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced
pressure. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography
(SiO2, 9% EtOAc/hexanes) (SiO2, 9% EtOAc/hexanes).

Diels–Alder Reaction among 14a and (R)-α-(−)-Phellandrene
A mixture of
1-(5-methylene-2-oxo-2,5-dihydrofuran-3-yl)dodecyl
acetate 14a′ (0.04 g, 0.12 mmol) and (R)-α-(−)-phellandrene (12, ∼85%)
(0.07 g, 0.54 mmol) in 1 mL of toluene was refluxed for 20 h. After
complete consumption of the dienophile 14a′, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Purification using silica
gel column chromatography (SiO2, 2% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded
the mixture of compounds (two spots showed on TLC, which are the mixtures
with epimers and exo/endo isomers). These two spots were subjected
to acetate hydrolysis using Stratakis’s reported method,6 purified by preparative TLC fractionation, and
subjected to 1H NMR analysis, and the obtained data were
utilized to identify the endo/exo ratio of this work.
