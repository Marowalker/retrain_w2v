Microfibrillar biochars of chitin
(CTF), chitosan (CSF), and cellulose
(CLF) were fabricated via green homogenization and a pyrolysis process,
and were subsequently explored as adsorbents for removing over-released
sodium benzoate (SB) in aqueous systems. The structure, composition,
morphology, and adsorption behavior of the as-fabricated biochars
were characterized. Results suggest that all biochars, with a microscaled
fibrillar structure and foam-like network morphology, underwent severe
chemical transition during the pyrolysis process, thereby causing
an enhancement of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area, pore volume, and aromatic and carbonaceous composition. Consequently,
N-doped porous CTF/CSF microfibrillar biochars displayed a distinguished
capture capacity toward SB compared to that of their fibrillar precursors.
Tailoring the chemical composition, porous structure, and sorption
mechanism constitutes a possible strategy to achieve adequate structural
effects of polysaccharide microfibrillar chars for potential application
in environmental treatment or bioenergy.

Introduction
Environmental
pollution has become a great threat to both ecological
environment and human health with rapid industrial development and
population growth.1,2 Organic matter continuously over-released
from various chemical engineering industries and food and textile
processes have caused serious environmental contamination in soil,
water, and air, thus leading to potential threats to biological and
human health even at very low concentrations.3−5 Sodium benzoate
(SB), used as a popular food preservative, inhibits microbial growth,
and it is recommended by Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations/World Health Organization expert committee on food
additives that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels of SB should
be 5 mg/kg body weight.6,7 Consumption of SB beyond its ADI
levels may be toxic and endangers the exposed population; it may even
cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rhinitis, bronchospasm, migraine,
anaphylaxis, hyperactivity, and, at times, death, in extreme cases.8−10 Recently, excessive SB
released from food industries into water has gained significant environmental
concern.

Various adsorbents, such as activated aluminum oxide,
fly ash,
zeolite, sand, and activated carbon, have been investigated and applied
at actual sites for organic treatments,11−15 especially biochar, a solid material having more
hydrogen and oxygen components than those in activated carbon, is
still in high demand as one of the effective low-cost sorbents.16 Active biochar, fabricated by thermochemical
conversion of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment,17 has been widely explored for soil improvement,
waste management, climate change mitigation, and energy production
by alternating the bulk surface area, pore-size distribution, particle-size
distribution, density, and packing.18 More
recently, biochars have been shown great benefit in the adsorption
process of hydrocarbons, aromatic organics, and inorganic metal ions
in aqueous systems due to their surface functional groups and highly
efficient adsorption capacity.19

In our previous work, microfibrillar cellulose (CLF), chitin (CTF),
and chitosan (CSF) were successfully prepared by a novel joint mechanical
defibrillation process of homogenization and wet-grinding.20−22 These three polysaccharide microfibrils
or nanofibrils, with a diameter of 50 nm, have cross-linked porous
networks and a high specific area and have been explored as highly
efficient adsorbents in the form of biodegradable films or foams for
aqueous heavy metal ions.22−24 However, the lifespan of these
naturally resourced polysaccharide nanofibrils as environmental adsorbents
would be shortened due to easy biodegradation in wet surroundings.
Aiming at addressing the issue of extending the lifespan of these
microfibrils as pollutant adsorbents for industrial waste, we fabricated
three microfibrillar polysaccharide biochars bearing functional groups
via pyrolysis in this follow-up work. Subsequently, we investigated
the effects of initial pH, temperature, adsorbent dosage, and initial
concentration of the solution on the SB adsorption performance of
the generated biochars.

Results and Discussion
Biomass pyrolysis
is a comprehensive process accounting for the
physicochemical structure and properties of the solid feedstock and
vapor products as well as the intermediate liquid. Typical thermogravimetry
(TG) and derivative thermogravimetric (DTG) curves of polysaccharide
microfibrils of CLF, CSF, and CTF are shown in Figure 1. The thermal degradation profiles of CLF,
CSF, and CTF displayed two sharp mass loss stages, corresponding to
two major derivative peaks, that is, one peak occurring at around
100 °C for all three samples, ascribed to the evaporation of
the water and/or bound water of the hydrophilic polysaccharide, and
the other peak at around 270–450 °C, designated to maximum
thermal degradation of CTF, CSF, and CLF. In accordance to the temperature
at maximum rate of degradation (Tmax),
three polysaccharide microfibrils exhibited totally different individual
thermal depletion performance, for example, the lowest Tmax of thermal decomposition of CSF at around 310 °C
was mainly aroused by the rupture of glucosamine and residues of acetyl
glucose amine units in CSF chains.25,26 The thermal
degradation peak at around 335 °C for CTF was due to the depolymerization
of CTF, with the formation of volatile low-molecular-weight products
as well as char.27,28 In the case of CLF, the maximum
decomposition occurring at around 420 °C was attributed to the
rupture of the xylan main chain and pyrolysis of CLF.29,30 On the basis of the Tmax of the three
microfibrillar polysaccharides, their thermal stability follows the
sequence CLF > CTF > CSF. It is known that the biochar yield
is variable,
depending on the pyrolysis condition and biomass feedstock. On the
basis of the weight percent of charred residues, the biochar yield
of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB was estimated to be 22.41, 20.59, and 36.04%,
respectively.

Figure 1 TG and DTG thermograms of CLF, CSF, and CTF.

Carbonization processes of solid phases must involve
phase changes
in crystalline and amorphous polymers as well as breakage and formation
of chemical bonds.30 The elementary compositions
of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB, measured with an elemental analyzer, are
listed in Table 1.
All microfibrillar biochars exhibited a higher C content (70.24–78.19%)
than that of their precursor (40.00–50.71%) but lower H (2.13–2.94%)
and O (11.18–21.02%) contents than those of their precursor
(6.43–7.70% of H and 42.06–44.89% of O) because a lot
of common volatiles, like H2O, CO2, acetyl compounds,
bio-oil constituents, pyrans, and high-weight anhydrosugars, were
released during the charring process.29 Corresponding to TG analysis, dehydration is the main process for
weight loss in the chemical reaction between hydroxyl groups and/or
in the repolymerization of pyrolysis products; CO2 was
mainly resourced from the depletion of ring-opened pyrolysis products.
During the charring process of CTF and CSF, acetyl compounds were
thought to be one of the volatiles that were released from the cleavage
of the side-chain amide. Consequently, the release of these volatiles
leads to a greater loss of O, which decreased from 42.06–44.89
to 11.18–21.02% in content. After pyrolysis, H/C and O/C atomic
ratios decreased sharply, implying that these biochars became increasingly
more aromatic and carbonaceous. Besides, the H/C rate of only 3% of
all biochars indicates that much amorphous surface carbon was produced
during the charring process of amorphous carbon (also evidenced by
X-ray diffraction (XRD) in Figure S1 in
Supporting Information). Therefore, the charring pyrolysis has a significant
impact on the elementary ratio, chemical structure, and composition
of the biomass char. To further ascertain the elemental form in biochars,
the general X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra and respective
XPS spectra of the core levels, C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, are presented
in Figure 2. According
to the binding energy values and the corresponding assessments of
FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB, C 1s could be fitted into two components (Figure 2b). The component
at 284.5 eV is commonly assigned to aliphatic carbon (C–C/C–H),
whereas the other one centered at 286.1 eV is assigned to the C–N
group and the carbon connected with hydroxyl (C–OH) and/or
O–R groups (C–OR). Accordingly, O 1s spectra of FCLB
(Figure 2c) show only
one peak at 532.7 eV (−C–OH), and the O 1s peaks for
both FCTB and FCSB, located at 531.2 eV (shoulder peak) and 532.7
eV (main peak), are attributed to −C=O and −C–OH,
respectively, implying the presence of some carboxylic and hydroxyl
groups in the char. With the absence of N in FCLB, a high resolution of N 1s for both FCTB and FCSB displayed
double individual peaks, attributed to the pyridinic-N centered at
398.5 eV and the pyrrolic-N centered at 400.5 eV,31 respectively (Figure 2d), indicating that the −NH2 side
group was partly converted into aromatic pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N,32 thus leading to much of the amorphous aromatic
carbon (also evidenced by XRD in Figure S1) transforming during the charring process.

and individual XPS spectra of C 1s (b),
O 1s (c), and N 1s (d) for FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB, respectively.

The morphologies of the three microfibrillar biochars are shown
in Figure 3. FCTB microfibrils inherited the
morphology of a random crosslinking network of CTF isolated from biological
chitin lamellar layer (Figure 3a,b). CTF biochars were composed of microfibrils with average
widths of 200 ± 10 nm, much larger than the diameter of the CTF
precursor (50 nm).22 Porous FCSB, as shown
in Figure 3c,d, displayed
less uniform (100–500 nm) and thicker microfibrils and a denser
network than those of FCTB, indicating a compact stack through π–π
or electrostatic interactions. However, FCLB is considered to have
plenty of mutually bundled and layered microfibrils with severe aggregation
into laminar microstructures (Figure 3e,f).33 Above all, the CLF/CTF/CSF
biochars exhibit a much larger microfibrillar diameter than that of
their precursor, which was presumably ascribed to the burn-off of
the completely isolated tiny fibrils being charred at 600 °C,
thereby causing an increment of pore volume. As listed in Table 1, the SBET values of FCLB, FCTB, and FCSB were 459.73, 422.87,
and 357.41 m2/g, respectively, which are highly related
to their microporosities (Vmicc) of 41.86, 29.48, and 15.46%, respectively. It is worth noting that
the pore space of FCTB is the highest but the microporous space and
specific surface areas of FCLB are the highest among those of the
three biochars. Biochars generated from charged CSF microfibrils preferably
formed a mesoporous or macroporous network, which was revealed by
their relatively high total pore volume but very low microporous volume.

of FCTB (a, b), FCSB (c, d), and FCLB (e, f).

Besides the structure and morphology of the biochar, many
parameters
strongly influenced the adsorption behavior when the biochar was used
to capture aqueous SB. Figure 4a illustrates the pH dependence of the adsorption of SB. All
biochars exhibited similar pH-dependent adsorption behaviors, that
is, the adsorption capacity of the SB electrolyte increased with an
increase in the pH from 3 to 7 and subsequently reduced as the pH
increased from 7 to 9. Maximum adsorption capacity values of 385.46,
335.23, and 261.87 mg/g were achieved at a solution pH of about 7,
corresponding to FCSB, FCTB, and FCLB, respectively, indicating higher
adsorption amounts at a low ionic concentration (neutral pH) than
those at high ionic concentration (acidic or alkaline condition).
Besides, it is worth noting that
the adsorption capacity of FCSB was higher than that of FCTB in acidic
solutions (pH 4–7) but the opposite trend was seen at pH 7.75–9.00,
which indicates that the adsorption process was dramatically affected
by the ionic interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate.34 The temperature dependence of removal amount
of SB at pH 6.58 is shown in Figure 4b. The removal amount of SB decreases from 206.14,
311.54, and 154.06 to 68.96, 41.37, and 34.48 mg/g for FCTB, FCSB,
and FCLB, respectively, as the adsorption temperature rises from 10
to 60 °C, thus confirming an exothermic capture process in nature.
The negative temperature effect of biochars was probably because of
the temperature dependence on ionization and chemical potential of
SB and the adsorbents. Figure 5a shows the dependence of the initial concentration of SB
on the adsorption capacity of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB. At a fixed adsorbent
dose, the adsorption amount of SB increased as the concentration of
SB increased. The experimental equilibrium adsorption amounts (qexp) of SB, as listed in Table 2, are 227.96, 148.01, and 129.02 mg/g for
FCSB, FCTB, and FCLB, respectively, indicating that the adsorption
sites actively accommodated SB at high concentrations. In comparison
to their precursors, CSF, CTF, and CLF, the three biochars exhibit
a 2- to 4-fold increase in qexp because
of their high specific surface area, which was readily accessible
to accommodate much more SB. Among the three chars, FCSB show the
highest adsorption capacity toward SB, which is mainly attributed
to its aromatic π-system and functional pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N
groups, thus promoting π–π affinity and ionic interactions
between them. Especially in acid solution, more protons were available
to hydrolyze and protonate into quaternary ammonium and compete with
SB to occupy the adsorption sites. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the high BET surface area, pore volume, and functional groups
of the microfibrillar biochar played important roles in the sorption
behavior.

In general, the isothermal adsorption process was
illustrated by
the Langmuir and Freundlich models.35,36 The nonlinear
form of the Langmuir isotherm is presented as eq 1. 1  where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
of the adsorbate (mg/L), respectively; qe is the amount of adsorbate adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent (mg/g);
and qm is the theoretical maximum adsorption
capacity (mg/g). RL is a parameter indicating
whether the adsorption is irreversible (RL = 0), favorable (0 < RL < 1),
linear (RL = 1), or unfavorable (RL > 1).

The Freundlich isotherm is
described as eq 2 2  where KF is the
Freundlich isotherm constant indicating the adsorption capacity and n is the adsorption intensity. The fitting plots based on
the Langmuir and Freundlich models for the adsorption isotherm are
shown in Figure 5b,c,
and the calculated values of the related parameters are listed in Table 2. In the Langmuir
isotherm, the RL values are in the range
of 0 < RL < 1, which indicates that
the adsorbent surface has sites of identical energy, allowing the
formation of adsorbate monolayers. Parameter, n,
in the Freundlich isotherm is related to the degree of surface heterogeneity.37 When the 1/n value is close to 1 or
even 1, the adsorption at the binding sites is thought to be nearly
homogeneous. The 1/n values of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB
were 0.4184, 0.4098, and 0.5128, respectively. Judging by the R2 of the two models,
the adsorption of SB onto FCTB, FCLB fit the Langmuir better than
it fit the Freundlich isotherm, suggesting a monolayer chemical sorption.
However, the Freundlich isotherm provides a better fit for FCSB, depicting
a multilayer adsorption process dominated by ionic interaction.

Figure 6 shows the
time dependence of the adsorption
capacity of the biochars (a) and their (b) pseudo-first- and (c) pseudo-second-order
adsorption kinetic models. All microfibrillar biochars exhibit a fast
and efficient uptake of SB in the initial few minutes (0–10
min) and achieve subsequent equilibrium within 4 h. Two kinetic models,
that is, the pseudo-first- and pseudo-second-order models, were fitted
to provide an estimation of adsorption rates and potential reaction
mechanism, which are described as follows, respectively 3   4  where K1 is the
pseudo-first-order rate constant (min–1), K2 is the pseudo-second-order rate constant (min–1), and qe and qt are the amounts of SB adsorbed at equilibrium
(mg/g) and at time t (mg/g), respectively. The kinetic
parameters (qe, K1, K2), correlation coefficients
(R12, R22), and adsorption capacity of the microfibrillar
biochars were calculated and are listed in Table 2. In comparison with the R12 values of
the three biochars, the R22 values of FCSB, FCTB, and FCLB were
0.9949, 0.9985, and 0.9706, respectively. Obviously, a better fit
of the pseudo-second-order
kinetics model for all biochars indicates that a diffusion mechanism
and chemical interaction were involved in the sorption process.

Conclusions
A green process of homogenization and pyrolysis
was deployed to
prepare pure microfibrillar biochars sourced from the polysaccharides
CLF, CTF, and CSF. Compared with their fibrillar precursors, the biochars
consisted of relatively thick fibrils, large specific surface areas,
and loose porous networks because the tiny fibrils were burnt-off
during the pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, the amount of hydroxyl groups
might be reduced for all microfibrils, whereas the functional groups
of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N were transformed in FCTB and FCSB. These
biochars captured varied isothermal equilibrium amounts of SB at about
227.96, 148.01, and 129.02 mg/g corresponding to FCSB, FCTB, and FCLB,
respectively. We built sorption models of kinetics and dynamics and
discovered that the sorption of SB onto microfibrillar biochars involves
diffusion and chemical sorption; specifically, the sorption was monolayer
chemical sorption on the homogenous surfaces of FCTB and FCLB, whereas the multilayer process was preferred for FCSB.

Experimental
Section
Raw chitin and chitosan powders, with deacetylation
degrees of
6 and 90% and molecular weights (Mw) of
203.19 and 161.16 kDa, respectively, were obtained from Jiachen Chemical
Company (Shanghai, China). Microcrystalline cellulose (MCC, bulk density
0.6 g/mL at 25 °C) of analytical grade was purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). SB of analytical grade
was purchased from Bodi Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

As described in our previous work,20−22 a certain amount of
raw chitin powder (5 mg) was poured into distilled water (1 L) and
stirred overnight to obtain a slurry at room temperature. Then, the
slurry was poured into a cylindrical wet-grinding machine (LABOR-PILOT
2000/4; IKA-Works, Inc.) and continuously shear-flowed through a milling
gap of about 0.2 mm for 20 cycles at a flow speed of 10 L/h. Subsequently,
the milling-dispersed chitin suspension was pumped through a high-pressure
homogenizer (M-100P; Microfluidics) under a constant pressure of 250
MPa for 10 cycles. The as-prepared viscose dispersion was then freeze-dried
into fibrillar foams, which were labeled as CTF microfibril. Using
the same method of mechanical defibrillation described above, CSF
and CLF microfibrils were also prepared and freeze-dried into foams.
Furthermore, the as-fabricated microfibrillar polysaccharide foams
were packaged in foil and subsequently subjected to pyrolysis at 600
°C for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Ultimately, the biochars
produced by pyrolysis from feedstock biomasses of CTF, CSF, and CLF
were labeled as FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB, respectively.

The parameters,
such as pH, adsorbent dose, initial concentration
of adsorbates, contact time, and temperature, that influenced the
adsorption behaviors of the biochars were investigated. Briefly, a
fixed amount of biochar (5 mg), used in batch adsorption tests, was
poured into an aqueous solution of SB in an orbital shaker at 180
rpm. By varying the pH of the adsorption solution from 3 to 9, the
temperature from 10 to 60 °C, the initial concentration of SB
from 0 to 200 mg/L, and the sorption time from 0 to 250 min, adsorption
equilibrium was achieved. After equilibrium adsorption, the samples
were filtered using 0.45 μm nylon syringe filters prior to analysis
on a UV spectrophotometer at 223.5 nm. The adsorption capacity (q, mg/g) and adsorption isotherms of SB were then obtained
by mass-balance calculations according to the following equation 5  where C0 and Ce are the
initial and equilibrium concentrations
of SB (mg/L), respectively, V is the volume of the
adsorbate solution (L), and m is the weight of the
adsorbent (g). The effect of the initial pH, measured by a pH meter
(PHS-25B; Jintan, China), on the adsorption of SB by biochar was evaluated
by adjusting the solution pH with a 0.1 M solution of HCl or NaOH.

The specific surface area was analyzed by the BET nitrogen adsorption–desorption
method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88 analyzer. The biochars
FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB were vacuum-degassed overnight at 100 °C.
The BET surface area was then measured and calculated under a relative
pressure range (P/P0)
of 0.05–0.3 and a N2 gas atmosphere. Thermal degradation
tests of the CLF, CSF, and CTF samples were carried out on a TG analyzer
(TG/DSC1; Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) in a dry nitrogen atmosphere.
The samples were heated from 20 to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
and then held for 30 min at 600 °C prior to cooling at a rate
of 20 °C/min. Weight loss percentage versus temperature and derivate
weight loss against temperature were plotted for thermogravimetric
and DTG analyses. Elemental analysis (C, H, N, and O) of the microfibrils
and microfibrillar biochars was conducted on with an elemental analyzer
(vario EL III; Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany). Morphological
observations of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB were carried out on an FE-SEM
(JSM-6700F; Hitachi, Japan) at 20 kV voltage. The samples were coated
with gold prior to FE-SEM visualization. Surface chemical compositions
of FCTB, FCSB, and FCLB were measured using an XPS spectroscope (ESCALAB
250Xi; Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a monochromic Al Kα source
(hν = 1486.7 eV) at a voltage of 15 kV and
an emission current of 10 mA. Survey spectra were an average of eight
scans at a pass energy of 200 eV, an energy step size of 1 eV, and
a dwell time of 100 ms. The concentration of the SB solutions was
determined using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600; Shimadzu
Corp., Japan) at a maximum absorbance wavelength of 223.5 nm.
