The amount of supercritical CO2 dissolved
in polystyrene
(PS), dissolution rate, and solubility under static conditions at
170–190 °C and 7.5–9.5 MPa were calculated by utilizing
volume-changing-method experiments and numerical simulations. By comparison,
the instantaneous error can be guaranteed to be less than 15%. The
two results are in good agreement, and the reliability of the simulation
method is verified. Based on the obtained results, another parameter
was added to the tested model, and the dissolution rate of supercritical
CO2 in PS under different shear conditions was numerically
simulated. The effects of temperature, pressure, and shear rate on
dissolution were analyzed. The results show that when the temperature
and pressure are constant, the dissolution rate of supercritical CO2 in PS with shear increases significantly compared with that
without shear. The conditions that enable the maximum dissolution
rate are 190 °C, 9.5 MPa, and a shear rate of 240/π. With
the abovementioned pressure and shear rate conditions, the maximum
solubility can be obtained under the temperature of 170 °C.

1 Introduction
Supercritical CO2 has a density similar to liquids and
viscosity and diffusivity similar to gases.1 Meanwhile, because of its low price, abundant sources, and environmental
friendliness, it can be used as a green alternative to traditional
organic solvents. Supercritical CO2 has been widely used
in polymer processing, such as extraction of contaminants from polymers,2 supercritical reactions,3,4 CO2-assisted polymer impregnation,5 particle preparation,6 and polymer blending.7 In recent years, the use of supercritical CO2 has attracted considerable attention from academia and industry.

During the process of polymer foaming, if the solubility of CO2 in the polymer is known, then the maximum amount of CO2 dissolved in the polymer will be known. Similarly, if the
rate of CO2 dissolution is known, then the time to reach
the dissolution equilibrium will be known. CO2 dissolved
in the polymer also affects the glass-transition temperature of the
polymer and the physical properties such as melting point, fluidity,
and crystallization behavior. The change of properties is directly
related to the solubility of CO2, so the dissolved amount
and dissolution rate of supercritical CO2 in polymers are
the essential basis for controlling the processing conditions of supercritical
CO2 auxiliary polymers.8−10 The key to the foaming
process is whether the polymer/CO2 homogeneous phase can
be formed in a very short time.11 It needs
to be based on a deep understanding of the dissolution process of
supercritical CO2 in polymer melts and accurate calculation
of the dissolved amount and dissolution rate of supercritical CO2 in the polymer melt. The research on the dissolution of supercritical
CO2 in polymer melts is of great significance in both academia
and industry. However, the solubility and dissolution data of CO2 in polymer melts for the optional design of the foaming process
are lacking.

Solubility and diffusivity data of gases in molten
polymers have
been investigated by many scholars. Sato12−15 studied the solubility of CO2 in polystyrene (PS), polypropylene, and high-density polypropylene
by using the pressure decay method (PDM) at a temperature of up to
200 °C and a pressure range of 2.5–20 MPa. Boyer16 obtained the solubilities of supercritical CO2 in polymer melts with PDM. The study showed that the solubilities
of CO2 almost linearly increased with pressure but decreased
with temperature. Tang17 discussed the
absorption and diffusion of supercritical CO2 in polycarbonate
and polysulfone melts through the mass loss method. To avoid the error
caused by desorption during sample removal, the quartz crystal microbalance
technique18−20 was used instead in the experiment. Because of the
shortcomings of the experiment, such as time consumption and high
cost, some classical predicting methods have been widely used by some
researchers. Chen21 applied the cubic and
noncubic state equation to the dissolution prediction model of the
supercritical and subcritical fluids in polymers. Aionicesei22 put forward the predictive model for the solubility
of supercritical CO2 in polymers by using the S–L
equation of state. Merker23 studied the
dissolution behavior using the molecular simulation method. Li24−27 used the neural network model to predict the solubility of supercritical
CO2 in polymer melts. The existing studies in the literature
focus on the solubility of CO2 in polymer melts, rather
than on the whole dissolution process. Besides, all the studies are
based on static conditions, which are relatively limited. This article
will analyze the dissolution process under shear conditions.

This study has three main objectives. The first one is experimentally
studying the dissolution processing of supercritical CO2 in polymer melts without shear. The experiments of molten PS with
a given mass under different gas pressures and temperatures were carried
out. In the experiments, the solubility, dissolved amount, and rate
of supercritical CO2 in PS melt under different pressures
and temperatures are investigated. The second objective of this study
is to reveal the amount of supercritical CO2 dissolved
in PS under the conditions of different temperatures and pressures,
with the help of the COMSOL simulation method. The third one is ascertaining
the effects of pressure and temperature on the process of supercritical
CO2 dissolved in PS under different shear rates with the
additional conical shear device.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Experimental Results and Discussion
Compared with the magnetic suspension balance method,29,30 the effect of shear rate on the dissolution process can be further
studied. Furthermore, the wave of pressure change in the dissolution
process can be avoided compared with the PDM.15 Based on the analysis of the experimental process of the device,
it has the following characteristics: (1) the dissolved amount and
dissolution rate can be obtained by recording the change of displacement
with time. (2) The dissolved amount and dissolution rate can be measured
under different temperature and pressure conditions. (3) In each experiment,
multiple groups of dissolution data can be obtained by changing the
temperature and pressure of the system, which dramatically shortens
the experimental period.

The dissolved amount and dissolution
rate under different temperatures at 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 MPa are shown
in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively. (a)
shows the change of dissolved amount with time, and (b) expresses
the variation of the dissolution rate with time.

Figure 1 Dissolution curves at
7.5 MPa. (a)—Dissolved amount; (b)—dissolution
rate.

Figure 2 Dissolution curves at 8.5 MPa. (a)—Dissolved amount;
(b)—dissolution
rate.

Figure 3 Dissolution curves at 9.5 MPa. (a)—Dissolved amount;
(b)—dissolution
rate.

According to the abovementioned three figures,
the following conclusions
can be drawn. Dissolution always increases with time until the equilibrium
is reached, at which time the dissolved amount reaches its maximum
value, which is called solubility. In the early stage of the dissolution
process, the dissolution rate is high. With time, the dissolution
rate decreases gradually until reaching equilibrium; at this time,
it becomes 0. When the pressure is constant, the increase in temperature
shortens the time required for supercritical CO2 to reach
equilibrium in PS, accelerates the initial dissolution rate, and reduces
the solubility of supercritical CO2 in PS melt. When the
temperature is invariant, the higher the pressure, the shorter the
equilibrium time and the higher the dissolution rate and solubility.
The results are consistent with the results in the literature,12,31,32 where the solubility of CO2 in polymers increases with increasing pressure and decreasing
temperature.

The phenomena can be attributed to some aspects.
First, this tendency
can be explained by the plasticizing effect of CO2. By
increasing the pressure, the gas molecules are forced between polymer
chains, expanding the space between molecules, and thus increasing
their mobility. The increased mobility of the chains allows more gas
molecules to be absorbed once the pressure is further increased.33,34 Second, when the pressure is constant, the increase of temperature
leads to the acceleration of the molecular movement rate and enhancement
of intermolecular convection and diffusion. In the case of the same
difference in the concentration inside and outside the PS, it is easy
for CO2 to enter the polymer. The macroscopic feature is
that the dissolution rate increases. As time goes on, the concentration
difference decreases so that the dissolution rate decreases until
reaching equilibrium. The higher the temperature, the stronger the
expansion of CO2, the lower the density, the weaker the
attraction of the polymer to gas molecules, and the smaller the number
of CO2 molecules that can be accommodated in the voids
of polymer chains. As a result, the solubility of supercritical CO2 in PS melt decreases. Third, when the temperature is unchanged,
the increase of pressure leads to the increase of CO2 density,
which makes the CO2 molecule easier to be pressed into
the polymer. The result shows that the dissolution rate and solubility
increase simultaneously. This conclusion keeps pace with the literature,30,35,36 in which the solubility of CO2 in polymers increases with increasing density at a constant
temperature. At the same time, an increase in temperature accounts
for a lower gas density, which can be correlated with lower solubility.

2.2 Static Simulation
The dissolution
curves at different pressures and temperatures obtained by static
simulation are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6, where (a) and (b) represent the dissolved amount curve and dissolution
rate curve, respectively. By comparison, it can be found that the
variation trend of the solubility and dissolution rate with time is
consistent with the experimental results. When the pressure is constant,
the higher the temperature is, the faster the initial dissolution
rate is, but the smaller the solubility is. When the temperature is
constant, the higher the pressure is, the faster the initial dissolution
rate is, and the larger the solubility is. It also has a good agreement
with the experimental result.

amount; (b)—dissolution
rate.

Figure 5 Dissolution curves at 8.5 MPa. (a)—Dissolved amount;
(b)—dissolution
rate.

Figure 6 Dissolution curves at 9.5 MPa. (a)—Dissolved amount;
(b)—dissolution
rate.

The effects of temperature and pressure on the
dissolution under
static conditions were studied through simulations. The results show
that the increase in pressure and temperature can shorten the time
needed to reach equilibrium and accelerate the initial dissolution
rate. However, for solubility, it increases with the increase of pressure
and decreases with the increase of temperature. The simulation results
were analyzed, and it was found that the trend of the solubility and
dissolution rate with time was consistent with the experimental result.

In order to describe the error between the simulation and experiment
of dissolution, the following formula is used to calculate it at the
t moment. 1  where δt represents the instantaneous error between simulated and experimental
dissolution at t-time, StSL is a simulated value of dissolution
at t-time, and Sexp is an experimental
value of dissolution at t-time. The instantaneous
errors obtained at each time are connected with a smooth curve, and
the instantaneous error curves of simulated and experimental values
of dissolution are obtained, as shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a,b, and c corresponds to 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 MPa, respectively.
It can be seen that the error between simulated and experimental solubility
is significant at the initial stage of dissolution. The reason for
the sizeable instantaneous error in the early stage of dissolution
can be summarized as follows. At the beginning of the experiment,
it will take some time for the system to reach the given pressure.
In the period, the increase of displacement can attribute to the amount
of supercritical CO2 dissolved in PS and the increase of
pressure. The initial displacement increment is, to some extent, higher
than the real value, which results in the large instantaneous error
present in the early stage of dissolution. With the rapid stability
of system pressure, the instantaneous error becomes smaller and smaller.

Figure 7 Instantaneous
error between simulated and experimental dissolution.
(a)—7.5; (b)—8.5; (c)—9.5 MPa.

At present, there is only the comparison of solubility,
rather
than the instantaneous errors during the dissolution process. The
errors between the predicted and experimental values of solubility
tend to be between 10 and 20%.12−17 Sato et al.12 calculated the error at
12.1% when the temperature was 100 °C, and the error would further
expand as the temperature increased. In this experiment, except that
the instantaneous error is relatively large at the beginning, the
error of dissolution can be maintained within 15% for the rest of
the time, which is in good agreement with the experimental result.

2.3 Shear Simulation
The dissolution
curves of supercritical CO2 in PS melt at different pressures,
temperatures, and shear rates obtained by shear simulation are shown
in Figures 8–16, where (a) and (b) represent
the dissolved amount curve and dissolution rate curve, respectively. Figures 8, 9, and 10 show the dissolution curve
at 170 °C. Figures 11, 12, and 13 show the dissolution curve at 180 °C. Figures 14, 15, and 16 show the dissolution curve at 190 °C.

The dissolution curves under static and shear conditions
were compared,
and we can conclude that the solubility under shear conditions is
the same as the one under static conditions. In other words, increasing
the shear force will not affect the solubility of supercritical CO2 in molten PS. However, the most significant advantage of
shearing is that the dissolution rate can be greatly improved. Under
static conditions, it takes tens of minutes to reach the equilibrium
of dissolution. For shear conditions, it only takes a few minutes.

With the increase of shear rate, the dissolution rate of supercritical
CO2 in PS melt is also increasing, especially at the initial
stage of dissolution. It can be seen that when the shear rate changes
from 0 to 60/π, the dissolution rate increases the most obvious.
The subsequent dissolution rate increases with the increase of shear
rate, but the increase margin decreases. The above phenomena are not
accidental. The specific causes can be summarized as follows: PS,
as an incompressible non-Newtonian viscous fluid, has the characteristics
of shear thinning. Under the action of shear stress, within a certain
shear rate range, the viscosity of the polymer decreases rapidly and
increases the flowability of the polymer. In other words, it can heighten
the entanglement rate of polymer chains, which can accelerate the
passage of CO2 molecules therein and make it easy for CO2 to enter PS melt in the direction of the concentration gradient.
As a result, the dissolution rate of supercritical CO2 in
PS melt is increased. It is not difficult to see from Table 4 that when the shear rate of
PS changes from 0 to 60/π, the viscosity increase of PS is enormous.
As the shear rate continues to increase, the viscosity of PS also
increases, but the difference becomes smaller and smaller, which explains
the dissolution rate of supercritical CO2 in PS melt with
the increasing shear rate, but the growth trend gradually slows down.

3 Conclusions
The present work focused
on the experiment and simulation of the
dissolution process of supercritical CO2 in PS melt. Comparing
the results of the simulations and experiments which are presented
as dissolution of supercritical CO2 in PS and the supercritical
CO2 dissolution rate in PS, under static condition, it
is shown that the proposed model gives results that are in good agreement
with the experimental result. On the basis of the obtained results,
another parameter was added to the tested model, and the shear simulations
were carried out. In the future, we plan to extend our study in two
directions. In the first, we will experiment with different polymer
materials, such as PC, PP, and so forth. In the second, we plan to
investigate how the dissolution changes with different mixing elements.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PS (>99.7% purity, Tg = 108.25 °C,  = 105) was supplied by Tai Hua
Polystyrene Co. Ltd (Ningbo, China). All the details of PS were given
by the supplier. CO2 (>99.5% purity) was obtained from
Guohui Gas Co. Ltd. (Nanchang, China). All chemicals were used as
received.

4.2 Apparatus and Methods
The dissolved
amount and dissolution rate of the gas (supercritical CO2) in the polymer (PS) melt were measured by using the apparatus,28 which is designed by this group. The measurement
method used by the equipment is the volume-changing method.

In this method, the amount of the gas dissolved in the polymer sample
is determined from the difference between the initial displacement
reading of the piston and the final one after equilibration. To this
end, our team developed a set of devices to measure the solubility
of supercritical CO2 in polymer melts, as shown in Scheme 1. The experiment
is conducted with the temperature range 170–190 °C and
the pressure range 7.5–9.5 MPa. The piston pressure vessel
and the high-pressure reaction vessel are made in stainless steel
with the sizes Φ105 mm × 360 mm and Φ120 mm ×
180 mm, respectively, and the maximum pressure that can be reached
is 30 MPa. In the heating system, the heating oil is supplied by TAIYAO
Chemical Co., Ltd. (Dongguan, China) and can be heated up to 300 °C,
and the accuracy of the temperature sensor is ±0.1 °C. The
oil bath is controlled by the lifting platform so that the two cells
can be heated evenly and flexibly. The accuracy of each pressure sensor
and displacement sensor are ±0.01 MPa and ±0.05 mm, respectively.
The displacement information of the piston is transmitted to the computer
via the displacement sensor, and the frequency at which the computer
collects the signal is one time/sec.

The main structure of the apparatus is shown in Scheme 2. The piston pressure vessel
and the reaction vessel are connected with a pipe with the inflow
valve. The temperature of them can be held by the oil bath, and the
pressure in the reaction vessel can be kept constant by the movement
of the piston. Most important is that these two cells must be well
sealed. The principle of this experiment can be described as follows:
a certain amount of the polymer sample is placed in cell 2; meanwhile,
keep valve 3 between cell 1 and cell 2, valve 4 open, and valves 1
and 2 closed. Cell 1 and cell 2 are evacuated with a rotary pump.
Then, close the two valves until the piston reaches the bottom of
cell 1. Next, the sample gas (supercritical CO2) is introduced
into cell 1, and it will make the piston stay at the top until the
pressure reaches a particular value (close valve 2).

Scheme 2 Principle
of Dissolution Measurement
At this moment, the amount of substance of supercritical
CO2 can be evaluated by the following equation 2  where T, pi, and z are the temperature, initial
pressure, and the compressibility factor, respectively, of the gas
at T and pi. V1 is the inner volume of cell 1.

After
reaching a certain pressure in cell 1, valve 3 is opened
to start the dissolution of gas into the polymer in cell 2. By controlling
the upper pressure of the piston in cell 1, the piston moves to maintain
the gas pressure constant in cell 2. Supercritical CO2 is
dissolved in polymer melts under the circumstances of constant temperature
and pressure, and the volume reduction in cell 1, ΔV1, can be achieved by the change of the position of the
piston. ΔV2 represents the volume
of undissolved CO2 in cell 2, and it can be determined
by using the following equation. 3  where V2 is the
volume of cell 2 and Vp represents the
volume of the polymer in cell 2.

As a result, the volume of
the CO2 dissolved in the
polymer under the conditions of pressure P and temperature T can be described as 4  

Based on the PVT equation,
the amount of dissolved
CO2 can be obtained. V is acquired by
the piston displacement through reading the change in the displacement
meter in the experiment, so the dissolving amount of CO2, S, is related to the reading, which changes with
time.

5 Numerical Simulations
5.1 Static Model Based on the Transport of Diluted
Species
The geometry model and finite element mesh of the
static state based on the transport of diluted species are shown in Figure 17. A cylindrical
geometry model is established according to the shape of the polymer
melt in the cell. The size of the model is consistent with that in
experiments, and it is determined by the shape of the reaction vessel
and the quality of the polymer. The radius of the model is the same
as that of the reaction vessel. The model height can be calculated
as follows 5  where m represents the mass
of the polymer, A is the radius of the reaction vessel,
and ρ is the density of polymer melt. Given that the model is
the shape of the rule, the mesh is constructed by the automatic generation
of the physical field control, and in order to improve the accuracy,
the mesh unit size selected is ultrafine.

Figure 17 Geometry model and finite
element mesh of the static state.

5.2 Shear Model Based on Rotating Machinery and
Laminar Flow Module
The mixing element is a cone, as shown
in Figure 18; the
radius B = 50 mm and the cone angle is 3°. The
design of the mixing element adopts the principle of the cone–plate
rheometer, which means when the cone-top angle is tiny (generally
less than 3°), the shear rate in the flow field remains constant.
The relationship between the shear rate and the speed of the mixing
element is as follows 6  where γ is the shear rate of the mixing
element and ω is the angular velocity of the mixing element.
The geometry model and finite element mesh of the shear condition
are shown in Figure 19. The size of the model is consistent with that in experiments, and
it is determined by the shape of the reaction vessel, the quality
of the polymer, and the shear element size. The N–S equation
is used in the calculation model, which is highly nonlinear. If the
mesh is over fine, singular points will be easily encountered, which
will lead to nonconvergence of the result. Therefore, on the premise
of guaranteeing the accuracy, the mesh size is set to be refined instead
of ultrafine.

5.3 Governing Equations
According to
the convection–diffusion characteristics of polymer melt and
gas in the transport of diluted species, we made the following several
hypotheses to perform the numerical simulation. (1) The fluid is regarded
as a continuous medium. (2) In order to exclude the influence of temperature
and pressure fluctuations on the dissolution process, the temperature
and pressure in the simulation are kept constant. (3) The materials
are isotropic. (4) Ignoring volume changes during physical dissolution
because the swelling volume is much smaller than that of the polymer.
(5) Only a few silicon-containing polymers are found to dissolve in
CO2. Therefore, the PS melt is considered to be insoluble
in supercritical CO2, that is, the diffusion process is
unidirectional. The diffusion coefficient of the polymer in supercritical
CO2 is 0.

Based on the reasonable hypotheses mentioned
above, the governing equations are presented as follows by combining
the rheology of the polymer process 7   8  where Ni denotes the diffusion flux, υi is the number of materials i produced by
the chemical reaction, and v⃗ is the fluid
flow velocity. No chemical reaction occurs in the simulation process,
so υi = 0. Under static conditions,
the dissolution of supercritical CO2 in PS proceeds spontaneously
along the direction of the concentration gradient without convection.
As a result, v⃗Ci = 0, the equation becomes a continuity one.

According to the
convection–diffusion characteristics of
polymer melt and gas in rotating machinery and laminar flow module,
we propose the following several hypotheses for the numerical simulation.
(1) Satisfying all the static assumptions, (2) no wall slip, and (3)
the mixing element used in the simulation process provides a constant
shear rate. The flow of the fluid is laminar.

The following governing
equation shows high performance in combination with the rheology of
the polymer process and the equations of the static model 9  where η is dynamic viscosity of the
polymer and F is an external force on the fluid.

5.4 Boundary Conditions
For all boundaries,
the initial concentration of supercritical CO2 and PS,
the concentration of supercritical CO2 after equilibrium,
and the fluid velocity field are mainly taken into account. According
to the process of dissolution, the initial conditions and constraint
conditions are set as follows:Initial conditions: the initial concentration of CO2 and PS in the geometric model before dissolution is taken
as the initial condition, and the upper surface of the geometric model
is regarded as the inflow surface of CO2. The initial concentration
of CO2 is 0. The initial concentration of PS is determined
by the ratio of its mass to its density. In the shear simulation,
the initial velocity field is set to 0.

Constraint conditions: concentration is taken as a constraint
condition, including the concentration of CO2 and PS after
dissolution equilibrium. The concentration of CO2 is calculated
by the S–L equation of state for binary mixtures, which is
shown in Table 1. As
for the concentration of PS after dissolution equilibrium, the concentration
of PS is equal to that before dissolution because the amount of PS
does not change during dissolution.

5.5 Material Parameters
In the static
numerical simulation, the parameters needed include the molar mass
of PS and CO2, the density of PS, and the diffusion coefficient
of CO2 in PS melt. The molar mass of PS and CO2 are 105 and 44 g/mol, respectively. The densities of
PS under different conditions are calculated by the S–L state
equation, which is shown in Table 2. The diffusion coefficient of CO2 in PS
melt is based on the experiment.37

In addition to the abovementioned four parameters,
the shear rate
of the mixing element and dynamic viscosity of PS are also needed
in shear simulation. The shear rate range is 0–4 circles per
second. The dynamic viscosity of PS is calculated by using the Cross–Carreau
model 10   11  where η0 represents zero
shear viscosity of the polymer. τ, e, n, G, α, Tr, and β are characteristic parameters
of the polymer,38,39 as shown in Table 3. The dynamic viscosity of PS
is shown in Table 4.
