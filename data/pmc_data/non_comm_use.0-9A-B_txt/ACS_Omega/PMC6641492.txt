A series of molecularly engineered
and novel dyes WS1, WS2, WS3,
and WS4, based on the D35 donor, 1-(4-hexylphenyl)-2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-pyrrole and 4-(4-hexylphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole as π-conjugating
linkers, were synthesized and compared to the well-known LEG4 dye.
The performance of the dyes was investigated in combination with an
electrolyte based on Co(II/III) complexes as redox shuttles. The electron
recombination between the redox mediators in the electrolyte and the
TiO2 interface decreases upon the introduction of 4-hexylybenzene
entities on the 2,5-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1H-pyrrole
and 4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole linker units, probably because of steric hindrance.
The open circuit photovoltage of WS1-, WS2-, WS3-, and WS4-based devices
in combination with the Co(II/III)-based electrolyte are consistently
higher than those based on a I–/I3– electrolyte by 105, 147, 167, and 75 mV, respectively.
The WS3-based devices show the highest power conversion efficiency
of 7.4% at AM 1.5 G 100 mW/cm2 illumination mainly attributable
to the high open-circuit voltage (VOC).

1 Introduction
Conversion
of solar energy to electricity using devices based on
abundant resources, simple manufacturing technologies and less energy
intense materials represent significant prerequisites to meet the
increasing demand of energy in the world. Dye-sensitized solar cells
(DSSCs) based on nanoporous semiconductors, liquid redox shuttles,
and sensitizing chromophores were reported by O’Regan and Grätzel1 in 1991. DSSCs are considered as potential alternatives
to silicon photovoltaic devices.2 In particular,
progress in DSSCs based on organic, quantum dots and organometallic
sensitizers have realized efficiencies >13%.3−7 Also, organic inorganic hybrid perovskite materials
are considered as inorganic sensitizers/transport materials and have
boosted efficiencies from about 4%8 to
>21%9 in a short time.10 In general, the design and synthesis of new donor−π–acceptor
(D−π–A), donor–acceptor−π–acceptor
(D–A−π–A), and donor–donor−π–acceptor
(D–D−π–A) organic dyes have resulted in
a large number of efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.11−16 Conversely, it is well-known that most organic sensitizers have
a rod-shaped structure, and they tend to form aggregates at the interface
of the semiconductor substrate, leading to lower photovoltaic efficiency.

Ruthenium-based dye sensitizers were the first to offer efficient
DSSCs with efficiencies >10%. Among all Ru complex dyes, N719 exhibited
the highest VOC of 0.846 V in combination
with a liquid I–/I3– redox system. N719 is characterized by a high dye load in the TiO2 film.17 The Ru complex sensitizer
performance was found to be improved after the introduction of alkyl
chains or triphenylamine units to the ligands.18−23 It was suggested that the enhancement in the performance was due
to a longer electron lifetime.23 However,
most Ru-based dyes suffer from relatively low short-circuit currents
(JSC). The main reason is charge recombination
from the semiconductor electrode interface to the oxidized component
of the redox shuttle or to the dye sensitizer.24 Moreover, such dyes suffer from low open circuit voltages
(VOC) as compared to other types of sensitizers.25,26 The VOC is mainly determined by the
difference between the quasi-Fermi level in the TiO2 substrate
and the Nernstian potential of the electrolyte redox mediator. Thus,
a redox couple with a more positive redox potential is expected to
render a higher DSSC VOC. However, a too
positive redox potential of the redox system will decrease the driving
force for dye regeneration (ΔEregen). This may result in slower dye regeneration affecting mainly the JSC.27 Therefore,
the electrolyte composition is a very important parameter for enhancement
of the DSSC efficiency.28,29

Regarding organic
dyes, the most commonly exploited configuration
is the D−π–A one.30 The configuration of the donor (D)−π bridge–acceptor
(A) dyes allows extensive structural flexibility.31,32 This design is favorable, because the drive and draw effects between
the electron-rich donor and the electron-poor acceptor and anchor
groups increase the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process,
leading to an effective photon-to-electron conversion.31 Wang et al., recently reported a power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of 12% for organic dyes based on N-annulated thienocyclopentaperylene
units.33 Energy-level engineering of organic
D−π–A dyes is preferably accomplished through
modification of the π-linker unit.34 In this respect, numerous organic dyes involving thiophene and its
derivatives have been exploited.35−37 DSSCs based on dyes
incorporating dithienosilole (i.e., used in this study) and cyclopentadithiophene
have demonstrated >10% efficiencies.38−40 Introduction of long
π-conjugation segments between the D and A groups renders elongated
and rodlike molecules, which may cause unwanted molecular aggregation
of the molecules.41−43 Organic dyes containing two donor moieties connected
to the π-spacer (D–D−π–A) are scarce
in the literature.44−47 The introduction of the extra donor moiety into the aromatic amine
to form the D–D−π–A configuration can cause
a red shift of the absorption band together with a lower tendency
to aggregate, as well as improved thermal stability as compared to
dyes based on the more common D−π–A structure.

Electrolytes based on both bis[2,6-bis(1′-butylbenzimidazol-2′-yl)pyridine]
cobalt(II/III) complexes and the I–/I3– system were investigated and compared. However,
under full sunlight, it was shown that the slow diffusion of the Co(II)/(III)
electrolyte species reduces the performance of the solar cells.49 It was found that the addition of lithium salts
to the cobalt-containing electrolytes leads to a reduction in the
charge recombination between the conduction band electrons of the
TiO2 layer and the electrolyte.50 It was also shown that by increasing the bulkiness of the dye donor
unit in combination with the cobalt redox mediators decreases the
interfacial charge recombination losses.51,52

Herein, we have introduced two different donor moieties into
the
D−π–A type of organic sensitizers to make a D–D−π–A
configuration (WS1, WS2, WS3, and WS4, Figure 1). Four new dyes were synthesized and investigated
in combination with iodine- and cobalt-based redox electrolytes in
DSSCs and compared to devices based on the LEG4 dye to monitor the
donor effect on device performance. We also present the rational molecular
design, in which theoretical and experimental techniques are combined,
to enhance the performance of DSSCs.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
The series of dyes synthesized:
WS1, WS2, WS3, and WS4 are shown in Figure 1. The preparation pathways are shown in Schemes 1–4. The first
donor fragment (D35)53 and the second one
(DTP)54 were prepared in good yield, as
reported, with some modification of the synthesis conditions. All
synthesized dyes were completed in two steps through Suzuki coupling
and Knoevenagel condensation reactions. The DTP-aldehyde compounds 1 and 4 were followed by bromination in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent
at low temperature (−20 °C) using N-bromosuccinimide
(NBS) to get compound 2 in 60% yield and compound 5 in 63% yield, respectively. Suzuki coupling between the
compounds 2 or 4 and the donor fragment
gave compound 3 (donor–donor) in 80% yield and
compound 6 in 75% yield as yellow solids. This was followed
by a Knoevenagel reaction with 2-cyanoacetic acid in chloroform and
piperidine to get the WS1 and WS2 dyes in 80% yield for both dyes
in the form of red and deep yellow solids, respectively.

The organic compound 7 was prepared as follows
(Scheme 3). Palladium(0)-catalyzed
C–N bond formation assisted the synthesis of brominated 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene
in the presence of tris-tert-butyl phosphine (P(tBu)3) as phosphine ligand.55 This ligand avoids inhibition of the catalyst by facilitating
the adjustable oxidative addition into the C–Br bond affording
the intermediate 7 in 49% yield. This was followed by
a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to get compound 8 in
88% yield, followed by bromination using NBS to render compound 9 in 82% yield. Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of the
bromide 9 with the donor fragment pinacol boronic ester
(D) gave the intermediate 10 in 81% yield and condensation
with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine (91%) provided
the WS3 dye. The WS4 dye was obtained using a similar synthetic route
as for WS3, except that the long alkyl group was exchanged for a methoxy
group allowing a comparison of the effects on the electrochemical
properties and solar cells devices. Compound 11 was prepared
through a coupling reaction in 75% yield followed by a condensation
with cyanoacetic acid to give the WS4 dye.

2.2 Theoretical
Calculations
To gain
insights into the electronic and optical properties of the investigated
dyes, DFT/TDDFT calculations were performed. The geometrically optimized
dye structures and their frontier orbitals are shown in Figure 2. All alkyl chains in the functional
groups have been replaced by methyl groups for simplicity. This will
make WS3 and WS4 identical, and thus WS4 is not explicitly mentioned
in the theoretical analysis.56−58 The WS1, WS2, and WS3 dyes all
display a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest occupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) pattern, which is similar to the family of
D−π–A dyes, where the LUMO is localized mainly
on the acceptor moiety and the HOMO is localized mainly on the donor
and bridging parts of the molecules. From the TDDFT calculations,
the lowest energy transition energies for WS1, WS2, and WS3 are 579,
447, and 529 nm, respectively (Table 1), which are in good agreement with the experimentally
observed UV/vis absorption maxima. The lowest energy transitions are
the ones determining the extension of light absorption into the red,
and thus, they are quite important for the theoretically attainable
photocurrent.

2.3 Photophysical
Properties
The electronic
absorption spectra of WS1–WS4 in dichloromethane solution are
shown in Figure 3,
and relevant data are presented in Table 2. The absorption band of the sensitizers
is red-shifted and the peak intensity is increased, when the π-conjugated
system is extended. Typically, D−π–A organic dyes
exhibit two bands of absorption: the first one arises from an ICT
in the visible region originating from a transition from the arylamine
donor to the acceptor group, while the other band originates from
a delocalized π–π*-transition in the UV region.59 The ICT absorption maximum for the new dyes
in this work (WS1, WS2, WS3, and WS4) can be found at 531, 388, 533,
and 525 nm, respectively. The extended absorption band observed for
WS1, WS3, and WS4 with respect to that of WS2 can be attributed to
the higher degree of π-conjugation introduced by the thiophene
unit.38,48 It is interesting to note that the D–D−π–A
dyes display three electronic bands in the UV/vis absorption region,
where WS1 and WS3 exhibit peaks at 531, 381, and 342 and 533, 421,
and 330 nm, respectively. The higher molar extinction coefficients
noted for WS2 as compared to those of WS1, WS3, and WS4 can be attributed
to the strong π–π*-transition of the donor to the
cyanoacrylic acid acceptor. Although WS4 is quite similar to WS3,
except for the hexyl groups instead of the methyl groups in WS4, a
distinctly higher extinction coefficient can be noted. Interestingly,
the most noteworthy difference in the electronic absorption peaks
of WS3 and WS1 is the absorption band at 421 nm for WS3, being 40
nm red-shifted with respect to that of WS1 (381 nm).

calibrated against an internal Fc/Fc+ reference (E° (Fc/Fc+) = 0.63 V vs NHE).

c Estimated by subtracting E0–0 from the oxidation potential.

2.4 Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
properties of the WS1–WS4 dyes were investigated by cyclic
voltammetry (CV), and all data are summarized in Table 2. A typical voltammogram of
WS3 is shown in Figure 4, and those of WS1, WS2, and WS4 are available in the Supporting Information, Figures S3–S5.
All dyes show a reversible, two-electron oxidation, where the first
is ascribed to the donor arylamine and the second to the other donor
group. The first oxidation peak of WS1–WS4 appear at 0.86,
0.91, 0.97, and 0.98 V (vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)) and correspond
to the oxidation of an electron from the HOMO, while the second oxidation
can be attributed to the oxidation of an electron from the HOMO –
1 orbital. The redox potential of WS4 (0.98 V) shows almost the same
oxidation potential as WS3, while the difference between the redox
potential of WS2 (0.91 V) and WS1 (0.86 V) is 50 mV. This shift in
the peak position may be due to the change in the π–acceptor
position. This is in agreement with the results from the optical measurements.
Overall, the data show redox potentials that are slightly lower than
for Y123 (1.09 V).60

the WS3 dye in dichloromethane solution

2.5 Photovoltaic Performance of the Sensitizers
The photovoltaic performance parameters for the cobalt-based DSSCs,
such as JSC, VOC, FF, and conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 G 100 mW/cm2 illumination, are shown in Table 3, as well as the current density–voltage (J–V) relation in Figure 5a. The corresponding data for
the iodine-based systems are shown in Figure 5b and Table S1 (Supporting Information). Devices based on WS2 show low performance in
combination with the iodine redox mediator, most likely caused by
the narrow absorption band of the dye, JSC = 4.94 mA cm–2, VOC = 680 mV, FF = 0.79, η = 2.7%. The corresponding devices based
on the cobalt redox mediator show a better performance, JSC = 7.6 mA cm–2, VOC = 827 mV, FF = 0.69, η = 4.3%. Moreover, the
higher efficiency of devices containing WS2 in combination with the
Co-based electrolyte can be linked to the more negative LUMO energy
and more positive HOMO energy of WS2. It is known that the photocurrent
generated in a DSSC is strongly affected by the redox potential of
the sensitizer. The energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO of the dye
must match the electrolyte potential and the energy of the conduction
band of the TiO2 electrode (ECB). Herein, the LUMO energy of all the dyes are sufficiently negative
with respect to the TiO2ECB, as seen in Table 2; because the driving force for electron injection is dependent on
the energy gap between the two levels, the performance is better for
these dyes in Co-based devices.61 Comparing
the devices based on WS3 JSC = 11.13 mA
cm–2, VOC = 680 mV,
FF = 0.77, η = 5.9% (iodine-based electrolytes) and JSC = 13.2 mA cm–2, VOC = 847 mV, FF = 0.65, η = 7.4% (cobalt-based
electrolytes), the latter results offer a performance close to that
of devices based on the LEG4 dye (8.2%). Moreover, short-circuit currents
of devices based on WS3 were consistently higher than those for WS1,
WS4, and WS2 and slightly lower than that for LEG4-based devices.
These results are in agreement with those from incident photon-to-current
conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Figure 6. The open circuit voltage (VOC) trend of the DSSC devices based on the dyes is WS3
> LEG4 > WS1 > WS4 > WS2. The DSSCs based on the WS3 and
LEG4 dyes
show higher conversion efficiencies than WS1, WS4, and WS2 in the
range 400–650 nm. A comparison between the WS3, WS4 and WS1,
WS2 dyes shows that the introduction of the n-hexyl-DTP
unit to the donor decreases the VOC of
the devices based on the WS1 and WS2 dyes, while the introduction
of 4-(4-hexylphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole entity increases
in the open circuit voltage of devices based on WS3 and WS4. It was
reported that62 the large number of aliphatic
carbons in the hydrocarbon chains, as in our case in the (WS1–WS3)
dyes, is expected to give a higher VOC, because of slower recombination rates. Our results suggest that
the second donor core linker structure deserves a credit for this
in addition to the side chains increasing the VOC. However, the introduction of the longer hydrocarbon tails
in the donor group seems to come with a price; the fill factor is
lower for WS1 and WS3, as compared with the congeners WS2 and WS4,
respectively; irrespective of reducing agent used (I– or Co(II)). This may be a result of slower dye regeneration rates
caused by the bulkier hydrocarbon groups.

2.6 Incident Photon-to-Current
Conversion Efficiency
(IPCE)
IPCE spectra of devices based on the dyes WS1–WS4
in combination with the redox mediator Co(II/III)48 are
shown in Figure 6,
and those in combination with the I–/I3– redox mediator and on a TiO2 film
are shown in the Supporting Information, Figure S6, respectively. The IPCE spectra correspond quite well
with the UV/vis spectra from the dyes adsorbed onto a TiO2 film. In comparison with the UV/vis spectra in solution, the peaks
are consistently broadened and slightly red-shifted, of course including
the absorption from the TiO2 film itself. The red shift
observed on absorption may indicate either a change in aggregation
mode or alternatively a decrease in dye aggregation caused by the
adsorption. The devices based on WS1, WS2, and WS4 were expected to
show a higher JSC than those of LEG4 because
of their extended absorption range. However, a lower JSC was found instead, amounting to 12.2, 12.3, and 7.6
mA cm–2, respectively. This may be attributed to
slow regeneration of the oxidized dye molecules or fast electron recombination
loss of injected electrons from the TiO2 to the electrolyte.
The IPCE for devices based on the cobalt electrolyte in combination
with WS3 is 78% at 550 nm, and this is comparable to the corresponding
devices based on LEG4. Maximum IPCEs of 75% are obtained for devices
based on WS4 and WS1, while the maximum IPCE of devices based on WS2
is 78% at 450 nm. It is worth to note that the device performance
of WS1–WS4 in combination with the cobalt-based electrolyte
is higher than that in combination with the iodide-based electrolyte.
It is known that the recombination loss reaction between TiO2 and the electrolyte typically is faster for the one-electron redox
systems than that for two-electron systems (like the iodine-based
one).63 However, in the cases of the WS3
and WS4 dyes, in the presence of bulky donor groups, in combination
with good conjugated dye systems, the recombination process is obviously
retarded. For iodine-based devices, an increase in the open circuit
voltage follows the trend LEG4 > WS1 > WS3 > WS2 > WS4,
whereas in
the case of cobalt-based devices the trend is WS3 > LEG4 > WS2
> WS1
> WS4.

2.7 Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
The EIS spectra were recorded for the two different redox systems
to offer an understanding of the electron transfer kinetics at different
interfaces in the devices based on the different dyes. The EIS analysis
illustrates the charge transfer resistance (RCT) of the TiO2–dye–electrolyte interface.64 The EIS of the devices based on the WS1–WS4
dyes were obtained using a reverse bias representing the expected VOC under one sun illumination. The Nyquist plots
of the devices based on the Co-based systems are shown in Figure 7. In the Nyquist
plots, the semicircles at high frequencies, left-hand side of the
plots, correspond to the charge transfer process at the counter electrode–electrolyte
interface (RCT); these curves are very
similar for all devices. The large semicircles in the middle frequency
range originate from the charge transfer process at the TiO2/WS1–WS4/electrolyte (Co(II)/(III)) interface.65−68 The results show that the devices containing WS1 and WS2 suffer
much less from recombination losses at this interface, and the recombination
of devices based on WS3 is slightly lower than those of WS4 and LEG4.65−67,69 As shown in Figure 7, the Rrec values for Co-based electrolytes increase in the order
of WS4 < LEG4 < WS3 < WS1 < WS2 under illumination. For
the devices based on the I–/I3– electrolyte, the Rrec values of series
dyes increase in the order WS3 < WS4 < WS2 < WS1 under illumination
(Supporting Information, Figure S7). The
results are consistent with a hypothesis that steric hindrance from
the dye molecules affects the reaction rate between the injected electrons
and the redox mediator such as (I3–)
or (Co3+) resulting in an increase in Rrec and as a consequence also in VOC.

Figure 7 Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on WS1, WS2, WS3, WS4, and LEG4 for
the Co(II/III)48 based electrolytes under illumination.

Electron lifetime studies were
performed to get further insights
into the relation between the dye recombination process and electron
injection process, and the results are shown in Figure 8a,b. Comparing the electron lifetimes (τ)
as a function of extracted charge density (Qoc) for devices based on WS1–WS4 and the cobalt redox
electrolyte, devices based on WS4 showed the shortest electron lifetimes.
This result indicates the importance of long alkyl groups in the dye.
This is in agreement with the open-circuit voltages recorded.70−72 It is also expected that the introduction of long alkyl chains decreases
dye aggregation and consequently to some extent inhibits electrons
in TiO2 from recombining with the electrolyte systems.
It is also likely that poor WS4 dye regeneration can affect the short
electron lifetimes. The significantly reduced charge recombination
results in a 102 mV higher VOC for the
WS3-based cells than those of WS4 (i.e. 847 mV instead of 745 mV).
However, WS2-based cells show longer electron lifetimes and higher VOC, but at the same time they show the lowest
PCE. Despite the best PCE of WS3 dye, besides the highest VOC among the systems, it showed longer lifetimes
than the standard LEG4 dye. The devices based on WS1 show shorter
electron lifetime and lower VOC than those
of WS2 but higher PCEs, 6.11%. This observation could be explained
by a relationship between the HOMO and LUMO energy difference (effective
band gap of the compound) and the open-circuit voltage,73 However the situation is different for WS3 and
WS4. Although WS3 exhibits a lower optical band gap (2.0 eV) and offer
devices with a longer lifetime as compared to WS4 (2.1 eV), a higher VOC (847 V vs 745 V for WS4) is obtained. The
inserted bulky donor into the framework of WS3 could cause a higher VOC by hindering the recombination of the electron–hole
pairs, causing an incremental increase of the pseudo-Fermi level in
the TiO2 substrate.74Figure 8b, shows a relation
between the charge density (dn) and the VOC of WS1, WS2, WS3 and LEG4 dye-based devices.
The charge extraction measurements were performed to study the dynamics
of the change in VOC in cells based on
the WS1–WS4 dyes and the relative conduction band shift of
the TiO2 film.17,75 As previously reported75 the position of the conduction band (ECB) edge and the electron density in the TiO2 film are the main parameters determining the resulting VOC. As seen in Figure 8b, all the dyes give very similar results,
which prove that the conduction band edge (ECB) in all systems is only marginally affected. The devices
of WS4 show the lowest dn (electron density) of all systems
at the same VOC, which indicates that
the conduction band edge (ECB) of the
TiO2 film is the most downshifted.76

3 Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized four D–D−π–A
dyes based on two different linkers introduced into the D35 structure.
The engineered D–D−π–A dyes were investigated
in DSSCs. The results show that the introduction of an n-hexyl-DTP unit into the D35 structure leads to a high VOC. Furthermore, the position of the acceptor moiety influences
the open circuit voltage through the LUMO energy level. On the other
hand, the introduction of the 4-(4-hexylphenyl)-4H-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole unit into the D35 structure leads to an increase in the VOC. The increase in VOC can be attributed to the long aliphatic carbon chains. Consequently,
the series of dyes render DSSCs with VOC in the order WS3 > LEG4 > WS1 > WS2 > WS4 based on cobalt
electrolytes.
It is remarkable that the photovoltaic performance of the WS1–WS4
dyes is highly dependent on the electrolyte redox systems used. The
results highlight the significant importance of the structure of the
secondary donor unit in D–D−π–A dyes.

= 2.05, 29.84, and 206.26 ppm, used as internal references for 1H and 13C, respectively. The UV/vis absorption
spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 750 UV/vis spectrophotometer.
The emission spectra were obtained from a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer. The high-resolution mass spectra were recorded
with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
Shimadzu Maldi 7090 (MALDI-TOF) spectrometer. All solvents, such as
tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, toluene, acetonitrile, and DMF, were
dried before used. The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates
were purchased from Pilkington (TEC15 and predrilled TEC8) and were
used for the DSSC working and counter electrodes. Screen printing
was used to generate a thin film based on a TiO2-paste
from Dyesol (DSL 18NR-T), as well as a layer of light-scattering particles
(JGC C & C Ltd. PST-400 °C, from JGC Catalysts and Chemical
Ltd.).

4.2 Cobalt Redox Complexes
Tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(III)
tri(tetracyanoborate), [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, and tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt48 di(tetracyanoborate)
[Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2 salts were prepared
according to the literature.51,52

4.3 Device
Fabrication
TiCl4-treated FTO glass substrates
were screen-printed with a modified
Dyesol 18NR-T paste and scattering layer and sintered at 500 °C.
A black mask with a 5 mm × 5 mm hole (matching the active area
of the cell) was used to prevent excess light from reaching the cell.
Counter electrode is platinized FTO. The resulting solar cell devices
were studied using two different electrolytes, based either on the
iodide/triiodide redox mediator or a Co(II)/(III) redox mediator.
More details of the device fabrication are given in the Supporting Information.

4.4 Dye Bath
The dye can adsorb differently
to the TiO2 surface depending on the dye bath solvent and
co-adsorbents used. For the one-electron Co-based electrolyte, the
availability of the TiO2 surface for recombination is an
essential factor. For electrolytes based on the I–/I3– couple, this is less of a problem
and a co-adsorbent can be used to reduce aggregation.A) For I–/I3–-based devices, 0.2 mM of the dye was dissolved
in dichloromethane.
Chenodeoxycholic acid was added as the co-adsorbent. The time for
the dyeing was 2 h. The electrodes were subsequently rinsed by ethanol
and dried.

B) For Co48/Co(III) based devices,
0.2 mM of the dye was dissolved in a mixed solvent of tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1). The films were left in the dye bath
overnight. Subsequently, ethanol was used to rinse the electrodes,
and finally, they were dried.



4.5 Electrolyte
The electrolytes containing
iodide/triiodide as redox systems were composed of 0.60 M 1-methyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.04 M I2, 0.06 M
LiI, and 0.40 M TBP dissolved in acetonitrile. The electrolytes containing
the cobalt complex redox system were composed of 0.22 M Co(bpy)3[B(CN)4]2, 0.05 M Co(bpy)3[B(CN)4]3, 0.10 M LiClO4, and 0.20
M TBP dissolved in acetonitrile.

4.6 Photovoltaic
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of DSSCs based
on the new dyes (WS1–WS4) were recorded under 100 mW cm–2 (AM 1.5) radiation using a Keithley model 2400 source
meter. The light source was calibrated with a silicon reference cell
before use. IPCE spectra were recorded by a computer-controlled setup
comprised of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator
(Spectral Products CM110), and a Keithley multimeter (model 2700),
calibrated by a certified reference solar cell. The electron lifetime
data were recorded through monitoring photovoltaic transients at different
light intensities by applying a small square-wave modulation to a
base light intensity.74

4.7 Electrochemical Characterization
All electrochemical
measurements were carried out in a three-electrode
system using an Autolab potentiostat with a GPES electrochemical interface
(Eco Chemie), employing a carbon electrode (Ø: 3 mm) as the working
electrode, a platinum column as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the reference electrode. All data were calibrated
with respect to the ferrocene/ferrocenium system. CV was carried in
a supporting electrolyte corresponding to 0.05 M tetrabutylammonium
hexafluorophosphate ([TBA]PF6) in dichloromethane solution
and 0.2 mM of the dye. All the potentials in this work are reported
with respect to the NHE.77

4.8 Calculational Method
Optimization
and single point energy calculations were performed using the B3LYP78/6-31G* level of theory without any symmetry
constraints. All reported calculations were carried out using Gaussian
09.79 The TDDFT excited state calculations
were carried out in ethanol solution as modeled by the PCM method
and using the MPW1K80 functional.
