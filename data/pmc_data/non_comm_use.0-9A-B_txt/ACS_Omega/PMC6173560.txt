Bisulfite and sulfite
(HSO3–/SO32–) are not only widely used toxic chemicals
but also active anions with important biological functions. Hence,
the development of new detection methods for HSO3–/SO32– is important for environmental
security and human health. In this paper, we report a symmetrical
hemicyanine for the detection of HSO3–/SO32–, SHC, which is constructed
with p-diphthalaldehyde with trimethylbenzoindolium
via condensation. The red fluorescent probe can fast respond to HSO3–/SO32– (<30
s) to give cyan fluorescence, and its sensing process is twice nucleophilic
additions, which were observed from fluorescence response, initial
ratiometric change, and subsequent turn-on increment; especially in
a low-concentration level, the ratiometric fluorescence measurement
can eliminate environmental interference. This probe can achieve a
quantitative detection of HSO3–/SO32– in a wide concentration range. Furthermore,
the probe SHC is a mitochondria-specific probe for ratiometric
fluorescent detection of HSO3–/SO32– in living cells.

1 Introduction
Sulfur
dioxide (SO2) is both a main atmospheric pollutant
and a valuable commercial reagent, and human exposure to SO2 has become increasingly widespread because of the combustion of
fossil fuels and the industrial manufactures such as paper pulp manufacturing
and metal processing. More and more medical studies have confirmed
that expose to SO2 may cause not only respiratory responses1 but also lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
and some neurological diseases, such as migraine headaches and brain
cancer.2

SO2 dissolves
in water to form a pH-dependent equilibrium
between bisulfite and sulfite (HSO3–/SO32–) with a molar ratio of about 3:1 in neutral
aqueous solution. Bisulfite and sulfite are widely used as a preservative
for beverages and food to prevent oxidation and bacterial growth.3 However, HSO3–/SO32– is toxic in high doses, which is associated
with allergic reactions and food intolerance symptoms.4 Hence, an acceptable daily intake (lower than 0.7 mg kg–1 of body weight) has been issued by the Joint FAO/WHO
Expert Committee on Food Additives. The labeling of products containing
no more than 10 ppm (125 μM) sulfite in foods or beverages has
also been required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).5

Endogenous HSO3–/SO32– can be metabolically generated
from thiol-containing
amino acids, such as cysteine and glutathione.6 The studies have showed that HSO3–/SO32– has an endothelium-dependent
vasorelaxing effect at low concentrations (<450 μM) and also
functions as messengers in cardiovascular systems.7 For this reason, the development of new detection methods
for HSO3–/SO32– is important for environmental security and human health. Because
of the advantages of simplicity, sensitivity, nontoxicity, and ease
of operation, fluorescent probes have been recognized as efficient
molecular tools for visualizing anions in living systems.8 In early years, some pioneer works about fluorescent
probes for bisulfite/sulfite anion have been reviewed.9 In recent years, some excellent fluorescent probes have
been designed by various effective reactions of HSO3–/SO32– including nucleophilic
addition to an aldehyde,10 mediated levulinate
cleavage,11 nucleophilic addition to an
unsaturated bond,12 and others.13 However, there are still some limitations in
the reported probes such as poor selectivity over biothiols or H2S for most aldehyde- or levulinate-based fluorescent probes,
long response time (>5 min for most probes), and high detection
limits
(>1 μM for half of probes). Hence, it is still a challenge
to
develop more reliable and quick response probes for HSO3–/SO32–. In this work,
we prepared a symmetrical dual-hemicyanine ratiometric fluorescent
probe SHC, which can detect HSO3–/SO32– in solutions fast and sensitively
and achieve detection of HSO3–/SO32– in living cells (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures and the Sensing
Reaction of SHC
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of Related Compounds
Synthesis
of two compounds, 2 and the probe SHC, involves
the same condensation reaction using the benzindole as a starting
material (Scheme 2). The reaction of 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-ethylbenz[e]indolium iodide (1)14 and
excess diphthalaldehyde affords major product 2 (yield,
66%). Under the same condition, the condensation of compound 2 with compound 1 forms the probe SHC in the yield of 63%. Also, the reaction of compound 1 with diphthalaldehyde in the ratio of 2.5:1 gives directly the target
product SHC. The structures of two compounds were fully
characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HRMS) analyses.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Procedure of the Probe SHC
(i) Ethyl iodide, toluene, 100
°C, 20 h; (ii) p-diphthalalhyde, NaOAc, acetic
anhydride, under N2, 60 °C, 4 h; (iii) 1, NaOAc, acetic anhydride, under N2, 60 °C, 4 h.

2.2 Spectral Response to Bisulfite
With
the two compounds in hand, we first determined their photophysical
properties. Figure 1 shows the UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of 10 μM SHC or compound 2 in a phosphate buffer solution
[1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), pH 7.4], a broad absorption band (330–570
nm), λmax 470 nm for SHC and 367 nm
(with a shoulder at 438 nm) for 2 and fluorescence band
(520–700 nm), λmax 595 nm for SHC and 586 nm for 2. After the addition of 10 equiv of
NaHSO3 for 30 min, the solutions of both SHC and 2 display almost disappearance of the long-wavelength
band in both the absorption and fluorescence spectra and appearance
of fluorescence at the short-wavelength band with a peak at 482 nm.
Obviously, fluorescence maxima of the probe SHC and the
sensing product are about 595 and 482 nm, respectively. Hence, the
probe SHC would exhibit a colorimetric and ratiometric
fluorescence response toward HSO3–.

Figure 1 UV/vis
absorption spectra (a) and fluorescence spectra [(b) λex = 345 nm] of 10 μM SHC (black) or 2 (blue) in the buffer solution (1% DMSO, pH 7.4) before and
after the addition of 10 equiv NaHSO3.

To obtain more detailed information, we monitored the sensing
process
of SHC to HSO3–/SO32– with UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies.
After the addition of 10 equiv of NaHSO3–, the absorption spectra of 10 μM SHC in the phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution (1% DMSO, pH 7.4) decrease rapidly in the long-wavelength
region (330–570 nm) and increase in the short-wavelength region
(250–280 nm) (Figure 2a). The probe exhibits ratiometric fluorescent response to
HSO3–, decreases and disappears in the
long-wavelength region (550–680 nm), and increases in the short-wavelength
region (450–550 nm) (Figure 2b). After the addition of HSO3– for 30 s, 90% absorption change and full disappearance of fluorescence
in the long-wavelength region occur already. This implies that the
probe can fast respond to HSO3–.

Figure 2 Time-dependent
absorption (a) and fluorescence spectra [(b) λex =
380 nm] of SHC (10 μM, pH 7.4) upon
addition of NaHSO3 (10 equiv) with 30 s intervals for 5
min.

In addition, a long-time monitoring
displays excellent photo- and
thermostability for both the probe and the sensing product shown in
Figure S1 in the Supporting Information.

Furthermore, spectral response of SHC toward
different
equivalents of HSO3– (0–20 equiv)
was observed by UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies
(Figure 3), and more
fluorescence titration data were provided in Figure S2a in the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 3, the spectral changes
show clearly two processes, fast decrease for the range of NaHSO3 (0–5 equiv) and slow decrease for 6–20 equiv
of NaHSO3 in the long-wavelength-band absorbance (350–570
nm) (Figure 3a), and
gradual disappearance in the long-wavelength-band fluorescence in
less than 6 equiv of HSO3– and increase
in the short-wavelength-band emission centered at 480 nm for the range
of 6–20 equiv of NaHSO3 (Figures 3b and S2a,b).
The two processes could imply two-step sensing reactions of the dual-hemicyanine
with HSO3–, the first addition in the
range of 0–5 equiv of NaHSO3 and the second addition
for 6–20 equiv of NaHSO3. The fluorescence emission
at 480 should be assigned to the benz[e]indol moiety.
The monoadduct could have a low fluorescence efficiency (480 nm) because
of the intramolecular energy transfer (ET) from the benz[e]indol moiety to the rest of the conjugation system, and the diadduct
would emit more than twice as strong fluorescence as that of the
monoadduct, shown in Figure 3 (bottom).

Figure 3 Upper: UV/vis absorption (a) and fluorescence
(b) spectra of 10
μM SHC solution (pH 7.4) upon additions of various
amounts of NaHSO3 (0–20 equiv), incubation for 20
min, under excitation at 380 nm, and (c) plot of the ratio of fluorescence
intensities (F480/F600) vs the concentration of HSO3– (0–10 μM). Bottom: the sensing reactions of SHC with HSO3–.

On the basis of the fluorescence titration, the fitting straight
line was obtained from the plot of the ratio (F480/F600) of fluorescence intensities
versus the concentration of NaHSO3 (0–10 μM)
and the limit of detection (LOD) for SHC to HSO3– was obtained as 0.1 μM from the calculation
in terms of LOD = 3δ/k (n =
11), where k is the slope of the fitting straight
line between the increment versus the concentration of HSO3– and δ is the standard deviation of a blank
measurement (Figure 3c). The plot of F480/F600 versus [NaHSO3] displays a good linear
relationship because only monoaddition occurs in the concentration
range of NaHSO3 (0–10 μM). Moreover, the disappearance
of the fluorescence peak at 600 nm involves in the first addition
(i); thus, the plot of fluorescence intensity at 600 nm versus the
concentration of NaHSO3 should exhibit good linearity;
besides, there will be a linear relation in the second addition (more
than 5 equiv of NaHSO3). For this reason, from the plot
of the fluorescence intensity at 600 nm (0–50 μM) or
480 nm (50–110 μM) versus the concentration of NaHSO3, LODs of SHC were obtained as 85 and 91 nM,
respectively, shown in Figure S2c,d. These
values are much lower than the standard of 10 ppm (125 μM) required
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.5

At a low concentration level of HSO3–/SO32–, the ratiometric fluorescent
detection can eliminate environmental interference and the detection
based on turn-on fluorescence increment at 600 nm for the high-concentration
level. Hence, SHC can achieve detection of HSO3–/SO32– in a wide
concentration.

2.3 Sensing Mechanism
To verify the sensing
mechanism, 1H NMR spectra of SHC before and
after the addition of excess NaHSO3 were measured. As shown
in Figure 4, the chemical
shifts at 4.91, 2.08, and 1.59 ppm are assigned to the proton Ha, Hc, and Hb of the probe, respectively.
After the addition of excess NaHSO3, these proton signals
remove to high field, 1.91(c′), 1.58(a′), and 1.13(b′) ppm, and
the chemical shifts of the protons (d, e) at carbon–carbon double bonds remove from the aromatic region
to 4.96 ppm (d′, e′).
Moreover, the formation of the single adduct SHC–HSO3 was confirmed by HRMS, where a dominant peak at a value of m/z 655.2992 corresponding to [SHC–2I– + HSO3]+ (calcd
655.2989) shown in Figure S3. Therefore,
the sensing reaction was confirmed to be the nucleophilic addition
of the probe SHC with HSO3–.

and after (red) the addition of excess NaHSO3.

2.4 Selectivity
To
evaluate the selectivity
of the probe for HSO3–/SO32–, we measured the UV/vis absorption (Figure 5a) and fluorescence
spectra (Figure 5b)
of SHC before and after the addition of various analytes,
respectively. The absorption spectra of SHC displayed
a large change only in the presence of HSO3– and little change for three biothiols, Hcy, GSH and Cys, and other
analytes caused no significant change shown in Figure 5a. For fluorescence response, only HSO3– causes a large change in the fluorescence
spectra of SHC (Figure 5b). The fluorescence profiles at 481 nm showed a remarkable
selectivity for HSO3– over other analytes
including HS– and biothiols. The increment of fluorescence
ratio (F481/F595) of SHC to HSO3–/SO32– is more than 200-fold, shown in Figure 5c.

and fluorescence spectra (b) of SHC (10 μM) in
the presence of 10 equiv of various analytes in
the PBS solution (1% DMSO, pH 7.4) recorded after 20 min, and (c)
ratio (F481/F595) of fluorescence intensities from (b), λex = 345
nm. (1): Blank, (2): HSO3–, (3): CO32–, (4): F–, (5): Br–, (6): Cl–, (7): I–, (8): NO2–, (9): NO3–, (10): HPO42–, (11):
HS–, (12): SO42–, (13):

The sensing behavior can be easily observed by the naked
eyes from
both the color change and fluorescence of solutions. As shown in Figure 5d,e, the SHC solution only to HSO3– displays a color
under room light and cyan fluorescence under a portable UV lamp (365
nm). Hence, SHC reveals a high selectivity for HSO3– over other relevant analytes.

2.5 pH Effects and MTT Analysis
To assess
the functions of SHC under physiological conditions,
the absorption and fluorescence spectra of 5 μM SHC with and without the addition of HSO3– (5 equiv) solution were recorded at different pH values. The pH-dependent
absorption and fluorescence responses of SHC to HSO3– reveal a remarkable change of absorbance
and significant fluorescence enhancements under physiological conditions
(pH 6–10) (Figure S4). This indicates
that SHC could be used as a fluorescent probe in a biological
system.

In order to detect HSO3–/SO32– in living cells, a MTT analysis
was performed to assess the cytotoxicity of the probe. In the MTT
assays, HepG2 cells were dealt with SHC at different
concentrations from 10 to 30 μM for 24 h. The results show low
toxicity to cultured cells under the experimental condition, and the
cell viability is more than 90% for SHC at 10 μM
(Figure S5). These data show that the probe SHC has low cytotoxicity.

2.6 Cell
Imaging
Finally, the probe SHC was utilized
for imaging of HepG2 cells. HepG2 cells were
seeded on a 24-well plate in a culture medium for 24 h. No fluorescence
was observed from nonstained HepG2 cells in both channels (Figure 6a–d). The
HepG2 cells were incubated with SHC (10 μM) for
30 min, followed by PBS washing three times. Confocal fluorescence
images exhibit no emission for the blue channel and red fluorescence
for the red channel under excitation at 405 nm (Figure 6e–h). In contrast, after being further
incubated with 0.1 mM NaHSO3 for 30 min, the HepG2 cells
emit bright blue fluorescence in the blue channel and no fluorescence
for the red channel (Figure 6i–l). This shows that the probe SHC is
a permeable cell membrane and potential fluorescent probe to detect
HSO3–/SO32– in living cells.

Figure 6 Confocal fluorescence images of HepG2 cells incubated
without (a–d)
and with 10 μM SHC for 0.5 h (e–h) and then
100 μM NaHSO3 for 0.5 h (i–l). Images were
acquired using 405 nm excitation and signal collection from the blue
channel (420–550 nm) and the red channel (550–700 nm).

Furthermore, cyanine derivatives
could localize at mitochondria
for their positive charge. To explore mitochondria localization, we
performed costaining experiment with a commercial mitochondrial dye,
MitoTracker Red FM. HepG2 cells were stained with SHC and the mitochondria dye in succession. As shown in Figure 7, the blue-channel image for SHC with HSO3– merged well with
the red-channel image for the mitochondrial dye and good consistency
for fluorescence intensity profiles across the line (Figure 7e,f). The colocalization coefficient
(Pearson’s coefficient) of SHC and the mitochondria
dye is 0.94 shown in Figure S6. The high
overlap coefficient indicates that SHC can cumulate to
detect HSO3– in the mitochondria.

0.5 h), MitoTracker Red FM (0.5 μM,

3 Conclusions
In summary, we prepared
a symmetrical dual-hemicyanine dye SHC for the detection
of HSO3–/SO32– from the condensation of p-diphthalaldehyde with
triethylindolium. The probe SHC can fast respond HSO3–/SO32– within
30 s as colorimetric and ratiometric
fluorescence changes and observed conveniently by naked eyes, and
LOD is as low as 85 nM. The sensing process is twice nucleophilic
additions which can be observed with absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies,
intimal ratiometric fluorescence, and subsequent fluorescent increment,
and this can achieve detection of HSO3–/SO32– in a wide concentration range.
Furthermore, cell imaging experiments reveal that SHC can detect HSO3–/SO32– mitochondria specifically in living cells. The new
probe is promising to be utilized in a variety of chemical and biological
applications.

4.5 Cell
Cultures and MTT Assays
HepG2
cells were seeded in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of
95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C for MTT analysis. The
cells were placed in a 96-well plate, and added the probe SHC in different concentrations (0–30 μM), and incubated
at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 for
24 h. After removing the culture medium, 5 mg mL–1 (10 μL) MTT reagent in PBS was added into each well and incubated
for 4 h. During this period, active mitochondria of viable cells reduce
MTT to purple formazan, and unreduced MTT was discarded. The formazan
precipitate in each well was dissolved by adding DMSO (150 μL)
and then measured spectrophotometrically with a microplate reader
at 570 nm. Finally, the cytotoxicity of each sample was expressed
as the percentage of cell viability relative to the untreated cells.

4.6 Cell Fluorescence Images
HepG2 cells
were seeded on the coverslips in 24-well plates and incubated in a
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h with the complete
DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C DMSO solution of SHC was added to a well to give a concentration of 10 μM,
and the volume ratio of the DMSO/culture medium is 1:100. After being
incubated for 30 min, and then the cells were washed three times with
PBS buffer. The cells were further treated with 0.1 mM NaHSO3 for 30 min, then removed the culture medium, and washed three times
with PBS buffer. The cellular localization was visualized under a
laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 710 Meta, Carl Zeiss Inc.,
Thornwood, NY). The green fluorescence of cells was collected with
420–550 nm channel under excitation at 405, 665–750
nm channel at excitation at 633 nm.
