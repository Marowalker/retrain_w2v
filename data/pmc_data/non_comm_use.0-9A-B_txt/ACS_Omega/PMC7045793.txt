A three-dimensional–two-dimensional
dimensionality transition
of organic microcrystals was performed via elongated octahedrons,
oblique octahedrons, diamond-like particles, and parallelograms using
nonplanar 2,7-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]
molecules. The specific crystal symmetry and selective adhesion of
P123 on the {11–1}s facet are supposed to induce the morphological
transition.

Introduction
Tailoring the morphology
and dimensionality of micro/nanomaterials
is critical in determining their properties, including electrical,1 optical,2−4 plasmonics,5−7 magnetic,8,9 and catalytic10−12 performance. For inorganic particles, especially
metal13−15 and metal chalcogenide16,17 micro/nanocrystals,
tremendous growth mechanisms and methods have been proposed to efficiently
forecast and control their size and shape under different conditions.
However, the formation of organic crystals is more complicated than
inorganic crystals to some extent: steric structures of organic molecules
must be taken into consideration, which cannot be reduced to balls
as inorganic counterparts usually do. Instead of simple close packing
of balls, organic molecular arrangement is more like a compromise
between the trend of 3D-packing volume minimization and the existent
steric hindrance from molecular geometries. Recently, many efforts
had been devoted to fabricate organic micro/nanomaterials of a variety
of shapes, such as wires, belts, plates, and polyhedrons. For example,
Hu et al. showed a 2D shape collection of heteroacene microcrystals
with different growth rates of six lateral planes, including hexagons,
elongated hexagons, rhombuses, and so on.18 There are also several reports on the manipulation of symmetric
3D morphologies including cubes, rhombic dodecahedra, octahedron,
and cuboctahedron.19,20 Although these studies are encouraging,
the uniqueness of organic crystals distinct from inorganic crystals
may not be embodied adequately in terms of crystal symmetry and packing
modes by using ordinary linear or planar molecules.

To fully
understand the characteristic assembly of organic molecules,
bulky molecules, especially cross-structured spirofluorenes, were
served as the building blocks. Based on the 3D steric architecture,
the supramolecular interaction forces can be oriented to all directions,
which lead to variable multidimensional morphologies.21 Furthermore, by jointing a planar supramolecular segment
to the bulky molecular scaffold, the original 3D polyhedral particles
can undergo a transformation to 2D nanosheets, which adopt an interdigital
lipid bilayer-like (ILB) packing motif.22,23 Besides the
molecular design strategy, here, we show a dimensionality transition
of 2,7-di(9H-carbazol-9-yl)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]
(2,7-DCz-SFX) microcrystals with the selective coverage of a P123
surfactant. By precisely controlling the area decrease–increase
of the eight exposed facets, a series of polyhedrons, including elongated
octahedrons, oblique octahedrons, diamond-like particles, and parallelograms,
have been generated in sequence during this gradual evolution from
3D to 2D. The unique symmetry of 2,7-DCz-SFX microcrystals is supposed
to be the critical point for the morphology regulation, which provides
benefit for the deeper understanding of the organic crystal symmetry,
molecular assembly mode, and the strategy to fabricate organic polyhedral
micro/nanocrystals.

Results and Discussion
The chemical
structure of the 2,7-DCz-SFX molecule is revealed
in Figure 1a, which
was prepared through the Ullmann-type coupling reaction between DBr-SFX
and Cz. The synthetic process and the confirmation of chemical composition
are exhibited in the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S3. The corresponding thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements are
shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5) as well, indicating that the molecules can keep stable
until 190 °C. According to the single-crystal data, the spatial
structure of 2,7-DCz-SFX along with the locations of weak supramolecular
forces were investigated as shown in Figure 1b. The molecular crystal structure presents
a typical steric hindrance feature: the xanthene segment intersects
almost vertically with the fluorene plane, connecting two carbazole
wings (the corresponding dihedral angles are shown in Figure 1b). The supramolecular interaction
sites are evenly spread over the SFX body and the Cz wings, acting
as the intermolecular linkages for crystallization. The single-crystal
data in Figure 1c indicates
that the 2,7-DCz-SFX crystal belongs to monoclinic system with a P21/n space group, which is
common in organic crystals because of the anisotropic molecular packing.
The concerning symmetry elements include the 21 axis and
glide plane, resulting in central symmetry crystal characteristics.24

2,7-DCz-SFX microcrystals were prepared using a typical reprecipitation
method. A THF solution of 2,7-DCz-SFX (1 mM) was added into 2 mL deionized
water with different P123 concentrations. Through scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), it can be found that the morphology obtained in
the absence of the surfactant is irregular as shown in Figure S6. In the case of 1 mg/mL P123, uniform
elongated octahedrons are observed (Figure 2a), indicating the shape-modifying function
of P123. With the increasing P123 concentration of 8 mg/mL, there
is a slight change in the area ratios of the eight exposed facets
of the octahedron, leading to the formation of oblique octahedrons
(Figure 2b). This trend
becomes more and more obvious with higher P123 concentration. When
the P123 concentration reaches 16 mg/mL, diamond-like particles are
generated via the tensile deformation of the octahedrons (Figure 2c). Although the
shape has changed dramatically, the original eight facets still remain
with four facets in the obverse side and the rest four facets in the
reverse side. From Figure S7, it is clear
that the four pairs of facets are antiparallel and centrosymmetric.
With the upper and lower facets growing larger and larger, the microcrystals
become thin gradually (Figure 2d, P123 concentration is 24 mg/mL) and eventually turn into
2D sheets (Figure 2e, P123 concentration is 32 mg/mL). The dimensional change is summarized
in Figure S8 by measuring the length, width,
and thickness of the 2,7-DCz-SFX microcrystals. During the whole 3D–2D
transformation, 2,7-DCz-SFX microcrystals own the same crystal structure
as the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns showing in Figure 2f.

The bottom line shows the standard powder spectrum simulated on the
basis of the single-crystal data by DIAMOND software.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images further confirm
the
shapes of the oblique octahedron, the diamond-like particle, and the
2D sheet in Figure 3a–c. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns in Figure 3d−f recorded respectively from [11–1], [011]
and [11–1] directions are attributed to the same monoclinic
phase crystal structure identified by XRD. Combined SAED and XRD results
together, the eight exposed faces can be indexed as (011), (0–1–1),
(101), (−10–1), (11–1), (−1–11),
(010), and (0–10). As the pair of opposite faces is identical
due to the central symmetry of the microcrystals, the bounded faces
can be summarized to be {11–1}s, {011}s, {101}s, and {010}s.
The dihedral angles are calculated as (11–1)/(011) = 101.69°,
(11–1)/(101) = 67.33°, and (11–1)/(010) = 70.01°.
Schematic models of the varying morphologies are drawn by WinXMorph
as illustrated in Figure 3g according to the assigned facets. Obviously, the elongated/oblique
octahedrons here fail to meet the criteria for real octahedrons in
terms of symmetry and morphologies.25 For
example, (11–1) and (010) belong to totally different families
of crystal planes with different molecular packing motifs, although
they look similar in the elongated octahedrons. Because of this distinctive
crystal characteristic, the transition between 3D and 2D is available.
This shape evolution is induced by the area variation of {11–1}s,
{011}s, {101}s, and {010}s, specifically, the increase of {11–1}s
and the decrease of {011}s, {101}s, and {010}s, as shown in Figure 3g. The corresponding
surface free energy in Figure 3h reveals that {11–1}s owns the highest surface free
energy, which should grow the fastest until its disappearance according
to the surface free energy minimizing principle.26,27 However, experimental facts did not obey this ideal assumption.
This discrepancy was caused by many environmental factors, among which
the involving of P123 surfactant should be the most important one.

The growth tendency toward 3D morphology originated from the aggregation
of 2,7-DCz-SFX molecules in three directions induced by supramolecular
interactions. Figure 4a discloses a representative fragment of the 2,7-DCz-SFX molecular
assembly viewed perpendicular to the ac plane, exhibiting the cross
sections of several molecular columns. The column is an antiparallel
packing chain of T-shaped 2,7-DCz-SFX molecules extending along the b-axis, as shown in Figure 4b. Therefore, the packing along the a-axis and c-axis is arranged in a staggered row,
as illustrated in Figure S9. There are
three kinds of dimers in the molecular arrangements with abundant
supramolecular forces as shown in Figure 4c (detailed information of supramolecular
forces is demonstrated in Figure S10).28,29 The column along the b-axis is assembled by dimer
1 as the yellow arrow indicates in Figure 4b. These columns connect each other in the
forms of dimer 2 and dimer 3, as indicated by the red arrow and blue
arrow in Figure 4a.
With the interconnection in three dimensions, 2,7-DCz-SFX molecules
reveal the growth potential of a 3D shape. However, the increasing
concentration of P123 additives could induce a “planarity”
growth behavior. The addition of large quantities of P123 was reported
to modify succinic acid crystals from block-like crystals to needle-like
crystals because the growth of the six side faces was inhibited.30 In our case, the intrinsic difference of the
largest {11–1}s and {010}s of pseudo-octahedron implies the
dissimilarity of their adhesion strength with P123. To investigate
the interaction of P123 with (11–1) and (010) planes, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in an aqueous solution environment
(the calculation description is stated in the Supporting Information). The snapshot images of the simulation
system illustrate the activities of P123 at the interface between
solution and (11–1) (Figure 4d) or (010) (Figure 4e) faces. It is obvious that the P123 monomers are
closer to the (11–1) plane, consistent with the binding energy
results in Table S1. The stronger interactions
between P123 and (11–1) plane can be attributed to the polar
oxygen atom on the crystal faces (Figure 4f). Meanwhile, the nonpolar parts of carbazole
on the (010) plane (Figure 4g) cannot interact effectively with P123.31 The strong inhibition of P123 on {11–1}s is supposed
to be the reason of the augmentation of {11–1}s and the shape
evolution from 3D to 2D.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of sequential morphology
transition between
3D and 2D is achieved using 2,7-DCz-SFX molecules, including elongated
octahedrons, oblique octahedrons, diamond-like particles, and parallelograms.
The crystal symmetry of the pseudo-octahedrons is distinct from real
octahedrons, which enables the surfactant adsorption difference of
the crystal faces and induces the precise manipulation of the microcrystal
shapes. This work may help to understand deeply the crystal symmetry
of organic crystals and their transformation behaviors.

Experimental
Section
Materials
2,7-DCz-SFX was synthesized by condensation
of carbazole with 2,7-dibromospiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene]
in high yields, and the corresponding detailed synthesis process is
shown in Figure S1. All chemicals were
purchased from J&K Scientific Co., Ltd. and were used without
further purification unless otherwise stated. Poly (ethyleneglycol)-block-poly(propyleneglycol)-block-poly-(ethylene
glycol) (P123) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further
purification. Ultrapure water was obtained from the Millipore S. A.
67120 apparatus (France) with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm.

Preparation of Micro/Nanocrystals and Single-Crystal Structures
The microcrystals were fabricated through a classical reprecipitation
method. Typically, a 2,7-DCz-SFX compound (0.66 mg) dissolved in THF
(1 mL) was injected into 2 mL different concentrations of a Pluronic
123 (P123) aqueous solution under vigorous stirring for 5 min, following
aging at room temperature for 12 h to stabilize the nanostructures.
Then, the nanocrystals with distinct morphologies can be formed in
the mixed solution. At last, the nanocrystals underwent centrifugation
and were washed with pure water at least four times. Single-crystal
data of 2,7-DCz-SFX was obtained by solvent diffusion method; tetrahydrofuran
and isopropanol are the good solvent and the poor solvent, respectively.
Crystal data for CCDC: 1949939 contained the supplementary crystallographic
data for this paper.

Characterization
1H NMR
and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian Mercury
Plus 400 spectrometer
with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Field emission scanning
electron microscopy images were obtained using a Hitachi S-4800 scanning
electron microscope at the accelerating voltage of 5 kV. For the preparation
of the SEM samples, a drop of 10 μL as-prepared dispersion was
deposited onto a freshly cleaned wafer with the solvent evaporating
completely. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) studies were performed in a JEM 2010F
JEOL and operated under an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The TEM
samples were made by placing a drop of 5 μL as-prepared dispersion
gently onto the carbon-coated copper grid. Samples for X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements were prepared by depositing a drop of a suspension
onto the Si slide with the solvent evaporating completely. XRD spectra
were recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer with Cu KR radiation
(λ = 1.54050 Å). The operating 2θ angle ranges from
5 to 30 Å with a step length of 0.025 Å. The single-crystal
data collection was performed at around 100 or 298 K on a Bruker 2000
CCD area detector using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71073 Å). All structures were solved by direct methods
using SHELXS-2015 and refined against F2 using SHELXL-2015. The surface
free energy (Esurf{hkl}) calculations
were performed using the Forcite and Morphology modules of Materials
Studio Software.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All
the all-atom MD
simulations were based on a GROMOS54a7 force field1 created by ATB2 and were carried
out using the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.3 The time step was 2 fs, and the total run time was 10 ns NVT for
the equilibrium MD simulation. We used the relaxed system as a starting
configuration. As it is prior to system relaxation MD, energy minimization
was carried out with a composite protocol of steepest descent using
termination gradients of 100 kJ/mol nm. The Nosé–Hoover
thermostat4 was used to maintain the equilibrium
temperature at 298 K, and periodic boundary conditions were imposed
on all three dimensions. The particle mesh Ewald method5,6 was used to compute long-range electrostatics within a relative
tolerance of 1x10–6. A cut-off distance of 1.2 nm
was applied to real-space Ewald interactions. The same value was used
for van der Waals interactions. The LINCS algorithm7 was applied to constrain bond lengths of hydrogen atoms.
A leap-frog algorithm8 was used with a
time step of 2 fs.
