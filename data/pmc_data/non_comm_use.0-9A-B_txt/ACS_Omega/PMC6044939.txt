Herein, we introduce
a new facile method of luminescent gold nanocluster
(Au NC) synthesis on the surface of bacteria for detection, counting,
and strain differentiation. The limit of detection was 740 ±
14 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL for the Gram-negative and was 634
± 16 CFU/mL for the Gram-positive bacteria. Brief treatment with
lysozyme could differentiate the Gram strains based on their luminescence
intensities. The current method could also detect bacterial contaminants
from water sources and kanamycin-resistant strains rapidly. This quick
synthesis of Au NCs on a bacterial template attributes an easy and
rapid method for enumeration and detection of bacterial contaminants
and kanamycin-resistant strains.

1 Introduction
Rapid
and easy detection of numerous drug-resistant bacteria is
a burgeoning field of research in the recent time. New methods and
tools based on the advanced biochemical techniques, such as PCR,1−4 mass spectroscopy,5 immunological assays/microarrays,1,6 and enzyme assays,7 have been adopted
for bacterial detection. However, along with the time constraints
and cost, these methods employ prolonged steps for sample preparation.
Detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria using optical methods,8 standard disk diffusion assays, and E-test at
various antibiotic concentrations on strips requires more than 24
h.9

Nanotechnology-based solutions
have gained much attention owing
to unique physiochemical properties because of small size over the
conventional methods for bacterial detection.10 Many nanoparticle (NP)-based detection methods require functional
conjugation of suitable probes,11,12 ligands,13−15 antibodies,16 and aptamers.17 Recent progress in this field has led to the
evolution of a “lab on a chip” for multiplex analysis
with heightened sensitivity. Among this diversity of methods, the
luminescence-based methods are fascinating because of rapid response
time, easy operation, and sensitivity.18−20 However, organic fluorophores
employed in the routine exercises have several limitations, which
decline their widespread applications. Further, all NP-based detections
involve two-way systems—first, the synthesis of desired functionalized
NPs and then the detection, and thus, the overall process is time-consuming
(12–14 h for bacterial growth only and separately for synthesis
and detection). In fact, the optical determination of antibiotic-resistant
strains involves extended procedure of synthesis and purification
of fluorophores.8 However, metal nanoclusters
(NCs) have been reported to overcome the inherent limitations of the
conventional organic dyes.21 In the size
domain of (<2 nm), the NPs do not support surface plasmon resonance,
which is the common phenomenon associated with the metal NPs; however,
they exhibit bright luminescence because of discretization of the
continuous electronic states of the metal. The synthesis of the metal
NCs offers huge challenge in their stabilization because of their
ultrasmall size, which often results in agglomerations of the NCs
or formation of plasmonic NPs. Macromolecules provide an essential
template for the stabilization of the NCs. A great repertoire of studies
has employed bio-macromolecules, such as proteins, small molecules,
and DNA as the template for the synthesis of the NCs that are useful
for bioimaging and sensing applications.21−24 A recent report has demonstrated
the synthesis of the gold NCs (Au NCs) inside cancer cells for the
use of bioimaging.25 Synthesis of Au NCs
was reported using Escherichia coli enoyl-acyl-carrier protein reductase, an enzyme commonly known as
FabI.26 Other reports of bacterial detection
using Au NCs showed a long synthesis and detection procedure.27,28 Hence, the use of entire bacteria as the template for the synthesis
of NCs could be explored to utilize luminescence of the NCs for bacterial
detection. Herein, we report a one-way procedure of bacterial detection
by synthesizing highly luminescent Au NCs on bacterial cells by slightly
modifying the reaction concentrations of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)
and gold chloride from already established protocol of our previous
work.29 For the present work, the reaction
mixture was exposed to (50 °C) heating for 2 min, which is less
than pasteurization. Interestingly, the luminescence intensity of
the Au NCs changes with the number of bacteria, offering a quick method
to enumerate the number of bacteria present in the samples. The method
is very versatile, where both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
were used to synthesize Au NCs, and at the same time, this method
can be employed for the detection of bacterial contamination in various
water sources (samples) based on its luminescence. Further, with increase
in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the present method
can also be employed to detect antibiotic-resistant strains in short
time where distinctive difference can be observed in 6 h. Therefore,
this current investigation emphasizes on the development of a simple,
fast detection method for “point of care” diagnosis
and prognosis, based on the luminescence property of the Au NCs on
the bacterial surface. The schematic representation of Au NC-synthesized
bacteria and their role in enumeration and differentiation between
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and kanamycin-resistant strains
has been explicated in Scheme 1.

Role in Enumeration and Differentiation between Gram-Positive and
Gram-Negative Bacteria and Kanamycin-Resistant Strains
2 Results and Discussion
Herein, Au NCs were synthesized using bacteria as their template
by slightly modifying our previous work.29 Overnight-grown bacteria were collected by centrifugation and then
redispersed in water at different dilutions. To this bacterial solution,
0.01 M MPA and 10 mM gold solution (HAuCl4) were added,
followed by heating at 50 °C for 2 min. The formation of the
Au NCs was confirmed by the fluorescence spectroscopy by observing
the luminescence peak at 580 nm after the formation of Au NCs (Figure
S1a, Supporting Information); however,
the plasmon peak around 520 nm, which is a typical signature of the
Au NPs, was not seen in UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure S1b, Supporting Information). The control bacteria,
that is, without Au NC synthesis, have no peak in the red region,
whereas after synthesis of the Au NCs, strong luminescence was observed
at 580 nm when excited at 320 nm (Figure S1a, Supporting Information). Interestingly, the luminescence intensity
gradually increases with bacterial numbers as depicted in Figure 1a, and the same phenomenon
could be visualized in the inset of Figure 1a. This experiment was performed on two Gram-positive
(Bacillus cereus MTCC 1305, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 439) and two Gram-negative
strains (E. coli MTCC 433, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 2488), where luminescence
increased with the number of bacteria (Figure S2). The luminescence of Au NCs originates from ligand to metal
charge transfer where MPA and gold salts form −S–Au
complexes. Also, it may be speculated that attachment of ligand-stabilized
Au NCs on the bacterial cell wall leads to the restricted motion of
the ligands. This might have led to lowering of nonradiative transitions
and energy loss, thus increasing the luminescence quantum yield. This
observation is consistent with the literature reports of aggregation-induced
emission enhancement and other such enhancements of photoluminescence
(PL).30,31 Here, MPA served as the surface passivizing
agent for the Au NCs and was responsible for the optical and colloidal
stability of Au NCs by forming −S–Au bonds. Whereas
bacterial cell wall served as the template for the synthesis of Au
NCs, possibly interacting with the carboxyl groups (−COOH)
of MPA and ultimately producing stable luminescent Au NCs. Hence,
the stability of Au NCs was imparted through interactions with the
surface proteins of the bacterial cell wall. To confirm the formation
of Au NCs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed, which
exhibited peaks at 82.62 and 86.27 eV corresponding to Au (4f5/2, 4f7/2) (Figure 1b). At the same time, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time
of flight (MALDI-TOF)-based mass spectrometric measurements (using
sinapinic acid as the matrix) analysis of the as-synthesized sample
revealed suggestive information about the formation of Au19 and Au22 atomic clusters (Figure S3a–d, Supporting Information). The peaks (m/z) were obtained at 5807, 5788, 5385, 5382, and
6332, which were assigned to 19, 19, 19, 19, and 22 atoms of gold,
respectively. However, stabilizing ligands were also considered for
the calculation of masses, which were calculated to be [Au19 + MPA19 + 3Na – 3H], [Au19 + MPA18 + 7 Na – 8H], [Au19 + MPA15 + 3Na – 4H], [Au19MPA15 + 3Na –
3H], and [Au22 + MPA19], respectively. Whereas
no such peak was observed in control bacteria (Figure S4, Supporting Information). Formation of Au NCs
on the bacterial surface was also observed under confocal laser microscopy,
where the bright yellow orange luminescence was observed on the surface
of bacteria (Figure 1c) on exciting it with 405 nm. The bright-field image of the same
is shown in Figure S5, Supporting Information. The microscopic images clearly stated that Au NCs were synthesized
only on bacteria, as a result of which bacteria as a whole showed
luminescence (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image clearly depicted
the presence of Au NCs on the bacterial surface (Figure 1d–f). For TEM analysis,
the as-synthesized Au NCs on bacterial sample was drop-cast into the
TEM grid after centrifuging at 8000 rpm for 5 min to remove the unreacted
materials and redispersed into deionized water. The Au NCs were prominent
on the magnified image of the highlighted bacterial surface (Figure 1e,f), while the surface
of the control bacteria remained clear as illustrated in Figure S7, Supporting Information. The magnified TEM image
of Au NCs synthesized on bacteria revealed that the average particle
size was found to be less than 2 nm. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
spectrum was also recorded during TEM analysis, which confirmed the
presence of the metal Au(0) (Figure S8, Supporting Information) on Au NCs synthesized on a bacterium. However,
the EDX spectrum of the control bacterium does not reveal the same
(Figure S9, Supporting Information). Further,
to enlighten the role of bacteria for Au NC synthesis, few control
experiments were performed. Au NCs synthesized without bacteria were
not stable for longer time. To check the stability of Au NCs without
bacteria, time-dependent florescence measurements were carried out
by probing the luminescence of control Au NCs (without bacteria) and
Au NCs synthesized on bacteria. It was found that the luminescence
of the control significantly declined within 60 min, whereas in 60
min there was a slight reduction in the luminescence of Au NCs synthesized
on bacteria (Figures S10 and S11, Supporting Information). At the same time, the luminescence of Au NCs synthesized on bacteria
was much higher as compared to that of the control (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

× 106, respectively. (b) XPS spectrum of Au NCs synthesized

magnified was marked in yellow. (e,f) Magnified image of the same
sample clearly showing the formation of the Au NCs on the surface;
some of the Au NCs are highlighted by white and red circles.

Importantly, the emission intensity
of Au NCs was found to be gradually
augmented with increasing number of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. This offers plausibility to count the number of bacteria
present in the test sample. For this purpose, the bacterial strains
were grown in the culture media for 12 h. The cells were collected
by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellets were resuspended
in water. The Au NCs were synthesized using the same reaction condition
by varying the numbers of bacteria and were prepared by serial dilutions
(102, 103, 104, 105, and
106) of the original stock of the bacteria. It was observed
that by keeping the concentration of the gold salt and MPA fixed,
the emission intensity of the Au NCs increased with the number of
the respective bacterial strains while maintaining an identical reaction
condition. Because the emission intensity of the Au NCs varied based
on the number of bacteria present in the test sample, it was used
to correlate with the number of bacteria. The increased luminescence
intensity was normalized with respect to the initial value (the luminescence
intensity of control, i.e., MPA and HAuCl4 only) and plotted
with log of colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of bacteria (where If = final emission intensity and Ii = initial emission intensity), and a linear relationship
was observed. The experiments were carried out on two Gram-positive
bacteria (B. cereus MTCC 1305 and E. faecalis MTCC 439) and two Gram-negative bacteria
(E. coli MTCC 433 and P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488) (Figure 2a–d). Interestingly, the results revealed
that the slope values were different for Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. The linearity of the plot observed herein signified that
the emission of Au NCs synthesized on the surface of bacteria was
directly dependent on the log number of CFU/mL for respective strains
of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The difference in the
slope could possibly be due to the variation in the cell wall compositions
of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, where it might have
acted as scaffolds for Au NC synthesis. To find out the exact number
of bacteria, a standard plate count method was followed, and the values
were obtained after multiplication with the corresponding dilution
factors. For this, the same amount of bacteria (by following the serial
dilution method) used for Au NC synthesis was grown in the agar plate
to find out the exact number of bacteria (CFU/mL). The average limit
of detection was found to be 634 ± 16 and 740 ± 14 CFU/mL
for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. The quantum
yield of Au NCs synthesized on bacteria was found to be 1.6% (Figure
S13, Supporting Information). Thus, the
interaction between the clusters and the functional groups on the
bacterial surface was evident to correlate the luminescence intensity
of bacteria and finally validates the direct relation of PL enhancement
with the number of bacteria used for Au NC synthesis. Further, the
restriction of the motion of the stabilizing ligand, upon binding
with the cell wall, might have prevented the loss of energy into nonradiative
pathways, thus enhancing the luminescence quantum yield.

(c) E. coli MTCC 433, and (d) P. aeruginosa MTCC 2488. Here, If = final emission intensity and Ii = initial emission intensity. Data are represented by taking
average ± standard deviation (SD) of three individual experiments.

The outer layer of the cell walls
of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria contains peptidoglycan, though the thickness is significantly
higher in Gram-positive than in Gram-negative bacteria. In Gram-positive
bacteria it has been reported that the phosphoryl group present in
the linkage unit along with two sugars of teichoic acid is covalently
linked with the sugars of the peptidoglycan layer, which are the active
cation binding sites. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria have an
extra outer membrane along with the peptidoglycan layer, which contains
phospholipids, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides, and proteins, where
phosphoryl groups are present in phospholipids in the same fashion
as teichoic acid. The negative charge of the cell wall could play
a major role in metal adsorption, as reported by the molecular stimulation
techniques.32

Additionally, the intrinsic
properties of the bacterial cell wall
composition were investigated to distinguish between the Gram-positive
and the Gram-negative strains. It is evident from TEM images that
the primary outer layer, that is, peptidoglycan of the cell wall,
served as the scaffold for the luminescent Au NCs, which can be tuned
for bacterial strain selectivity. Thus the role of the cell wall in
stabilization of Au NCs was explored for both Gram -positive and Gram-
negative bacteria. For this the respective bacterial strains were
treated with lysozyme (1 mg/mL) for various time periods (0, 20 and
30 min). It is to be noted here that lysozyme used here is only to
degrade the cell wall of bacteria,33 which
had been removed from the medium following treatment. Thereafter,
the cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and
used as templates for Au NC synthesis maintaining the same reaction
condition and precursors (i.e., HAuCl4 and MPA). The results
revealed that the emission intensity of Au NCs synthesized after lysozyme
treatment in the case of Gram-positive bacteria was low as compared
to that of the lysozyme-treated Gram-negative bacteria at both the
time points, indicating the possibility of the role of the bacterial
cell wall as a scaffold for Au NCs (Figure 3a). It is well-known that both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria have peptidoglycan as cell wall components;
however, its thickness is different in Gram-positive than in Gram-negative
bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer,
which is known to be sensitive toward lysozyme.33 Whereas Gram-negative bacteria have two layered wall structures
with a thinner peptidoglycan layer, which is covered by the outer
membrane comprising phospholipids, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides,
and proteins and is thus prevented or less affected by the lysozyme
action. Hence, on lysozyme treatment, the cell wall of the Gram-positive
bacteria degraded fast, and therefore, the luminescence of the product
Au NCs was less in comparison to that of Au NCs formed in the presence
of the lysozyme-treated Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the method offered
the scope of distinguishing Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
based on the luminescence of Au NCs. Here, the control stands for
Au NC synthesis on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without
treatment with lysozyme, which has been converted to 100% for comparison
with the treated groups (lysozyme treatment at two time points), respectively.

A plot was generated by average ± SD of three individual experiments.
The analysis of variance test revealed the statistical significance,
which is represented by “*” (p <
0.05), “***” (p < 0.001), and “****”
(p < 0.0001). (c) AFM image of control bacteria
and (d) AFM image of Au NC-synthesized bacteria.

At the same time, the current method was employed to test
the presence
of bacteria (bacterial contaminants) in water for its practicability.
Water from three different sources, namely, laboratory wastewater,
river water, and pond water, along with a control group (i.e., Milli-Q
grade water), were collected. To detect bacteria in water samples,
Au NCs were synthesized as mentioned earlier using water from different
sources. The luminescence peak was observed with all the water samples
except in the control group (Figure S14, Supporting Information). Subsequently, the presence of bacteria was confirmed
by the agar plate colony count method, where no colonies were observed
with Milli-Q water and the highest numbers of colonies were found
in the laboratory wastewater, as the number of bacteria was the highest
in that case. Thus, the probe for bacterial detection, that is, the
luminescence property of Au NCs synthesized on bacteria, is directly
proportional to the number of bacteria in the system. Further, the
luminescence of Au NCs on bacteria was explored to find out the antibiotic-resistant
strains as well. To circumvent the threat of antibiotic-resistant
bacteria via early detection, the current method was used to find
out the antibiotic-resistant strain based on the luminescence intensity
of Au NCs synthesized on bacteria. It is to be noted here that mostly
antibiotic disks were used to find out antibiotic- resistant strains
which take 10–12 h to form colonies. For this application,
pet-28a (DH5-α) and pEGFP-N1 (DH5-α) which are kanamycin
antibiotic-resistant strains and Gram-positive B. cereus MTCC 1305 and Gram-negative E. coli MTCC 433 bacteria nonkanamycin-resistant strains were chosen. First,
the respective strains of bacteria (5 × 106) with
kanamycin (10 μL of 50 mg/mL) were incubated and then at different
time points (0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 h) bacteria were collected by centrifugation,
followed by Au NC synthesis. Remarkably, after 6 h, significant difference
in the emission of Au NCs was observed in the case of kanamycin-resistant
strains (pet-28a and pEGFP-N1) in comparison to that of the nonkanamycin-resistant
strains (Figure 3b).
This is mainly because kanamycin inhibits the growth of nonresistant
bacteria (Gram-positive B. cereus MTCC
1305 and Gram-negative E. coli MTCC
433), whereas resistant strains grow with time. As already mentioned
before, the linearity of the plots indicated that the emission of
Au NCs synthesized directly depended on the log number of CFU/mL of
bacteria. Hence, the current method can be employed to find out kanamycin-resistant
strains within 6 h based on Au NCs synthesized on the bacterial surface
where emission of Au NCs is directly proportional to the number of
bacteria. Hence, the overall time for detection has been drastically
reduced as Au NC synthesis was possible at all the respective time
points while growing the bacteria. Therefore, the luminescence of
Au NCs was useful for the detection of bacteria in a very short time,
while normal bacterial detection needs at least 12 h for their growth
followed by different procedures of detection. At the same time, the
cellular cytotoxicity of the Au NCs synthesized on bacteria was also
checked following incubation with HEK-293 cells for 24 h and was found
to be nontoxic (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis was also performed
to monitor the structural changes on the surface of bacteria (Gram-negative E. coli MTCC 433). It has been found that the bacterial
surface was rough and indented after the synthesis of Au NCs, as compared
to the control bacteria (Figure 3c,d). The surface roughness and indentation of the
bacteria after Au NC synthesis were quantified using Gwyddion software
analysis (Table S1, Supporting Information).

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have developed
a new method of synthesis of Au NCs
using bacteria as the template. The luminescence property of the as-synthesized
Au NCs was probed for bacterial detection and counting. This method
was applied to analyze bacterial contamination in water from various
sources. Furthermore, the method distinguished between kanamycin-resistant
bacterial strains using luminescence of Au NCs on the bacteria. The
major advantage of this method is to detect bacteria within short
time as direct synthesis on bacteria can be used for detection with
opposed to available routine detection techniques. Thus, the current
method is a new, easy, rapid, nontoxic, and low-cost approach for
detection and enumeration of Gram-positive and Gram-negative kanamycin-resistant
strains and bacterial contamination in water sources.
