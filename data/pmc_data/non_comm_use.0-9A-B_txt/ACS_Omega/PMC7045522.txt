Herein, Ni–W
alloy matrixes were successfully fortified
with two salen-type Schiff bases 1-((E)-(2-((E)-(2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyleneamino)phenylimino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol
(OPD) and 1-((E)-(2-((E)-(2-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)methyleneamino)phenylimino)methyl)naphthalen-2-ol (PPD) as
additives, of similar molecular structure but varied isomeric spacers,
using a facile direct current electrodeposition technique. The resulting
coatings from the additive-introduced reaction system were termed
as Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD throughout the study. The deterioration
process (0.5 M H2SO4), surface properties, elemental
composition, functional groups, and structurs of the resultant coatings
were analyzed by means of Tafel and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD).
The bare Ni–W alloy deposition resulted in a loose microstructure
with higher porosity density (12.2%), while that of additive-doped
plating electrolytes resulted in a compact and dense microstructure
with lesser porosity density (6.3%) and minimal porosity density (3.7%)
as for Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD alloy coatings, respectively.
Improved corrosion parameters presented superior corrosion characteristics
of Ni–W alloy coatings from an additive (PPD)-induced bath,
i.e., Ni–W/PPD. Synergetic adsorption of imine groups (N atoms),
hydroxyl groups (O atoms), and aromatic electron clouds and reduction
in steric hindrance produced by a larger isomeric spacer strengthened
the surface adsorption of additives, yielding a fine nanocrystalline
Ni–W coating with reduced porosity and well-refined grains,
implying the outstanding shielding effect. Results of FESEM, AFM,
and XRD analyses revealed a complete cohesion between two neighboring
islands, resulting in a fine planar structure with minimal coating
defects for Ni–W/PPD coatings, authenticating the corrosion
parameters.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Prior to 1937, the utilization
of tungsten heavy alloys or heavy
metal alloys along with the addition of low-temperature elements (Ni,
Co, and Cu) has provided high strength or toughness and ductility.1,2 Over a period of time, the concept of the application of this type
of matrix (Ni–W) as a protective coating has gained significant
interest with the major thrust coming from the ordinance sector (replacement
of depleted uranium as kinetic energy penetrators),3−8 heavy duty electrical contact materials, plasma-facing materials
in fusion reactors, and many other applications.9 Over recent years, various metals, ceramics, and organic
additives were added to the basic electrolyte (Ni–W ion solution)
as composites to attain metallic nanocomposites of ultrafine microstructures
with enhanced corrosion-resistant and electroerosion features. For
achieving this, composites (alloying elements) like Co, Fe, P, etc.;
metallic nanoreinforcements like Al2O3, ZrO2, TiB2, BC, SiC, WC, diamond, TiN, etc.; and organic
additives like saccharin, glycine, vanillin, salicylaldehyde, etc.
were introduced into the metallic (Ni–W) matrix that has gained
an extended support to further enhance the physical and mechanical
properties.10 Furthermore, its application
results in an increase in the service life of turbine blades that
operate under high-temperature and -erosion conditions11 and meets the growing demands of advanced equipment
manufacturing industries.12,13 In most corresponding
research works, the fabrication of Ni–W alloy coatings with
tailored closed porosity has gained a commercial prominence to stabilize
the nanostructure against coarsening. Among the diverse surface modification
techniques, such as microarc oxidation, powder metallurgy, physical
vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, etc., electrodeposition
has become a favorable choice owing to its simplicity and affordability
and being time saving and economically affordable.14,15 This traditional tecchnique is one of the most established techiques
and enables to tailor the metallic coatings (composites, alloys) uniformly
at high growth rate on an industrial scale.16 Moreover, the technique is quite versatile that aids in achieving
single/multilayered coatings on complex geometries, which improves
the lustrous property17 and functional
property and extends the service life of machinery parts that can
be applied in various engineering fields.18,19 To date, the administration of organic additives into alloy electrolytes
is in practice, primarily as a best corrosion mitigation tool. However,
it plays multiple roles as a brightener, stress reliever, leveling
agent, grain refiner, tensile ductility improver, and complexing agent.17,20,21 These additives are easy to handle,
economically pragmatic, and offers pertinent solubility in the metal
electrolytes without any agglomeration as that for nanoparticles.22 Moreover, the presence of infinitesimal, highly
efficient, multiple/conjugated bonds (C=C, C=N, C=O,
etc.), inherent π electrons, and heteroatoms (N, O, S, and P)
contributes to the effective adsorption contiguity that triggers the
corrosion reduction process. Studies on the application of salen-type
Schiff bases as corrosion inhibitors have been reported.23−25 The application of naphthalene and its derivatives as additives
in the plating baths has been reported, subject to its varied role
in the action of play. The subjected naphthalene derivatives acted
as an internal stress reliever in nickel Watts-type baths;26 upon addition of naphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic
acid to the Pd deep eutectic solvent system, thin, dense, compact,
and smooth deposits were formed,27 and
it also acted as a good hardening agent in Ni–Co binary alloy
coatings.28 However, less attention have
been focused on the application of this type of additives (similar
geometry and varied spacer) in a Ni–W ion solution (plating
bath). The present work has been carried out with intention to explore
the effect of additives (OPD and PPD) on the corrosion-resistant property
of Ni–W alloy coatings with the aid of electrochemical measurements.
Further, their scientific underpinnings were elaborated using field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy
dispersive X-ray analysis.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Film Preparation
The molecular structures
of employed additives are shown in Figure 1, and their synthesis and characterization
are reported elsewhere.29 The fabrication
of the identified Ni–W alloys was achieved on a copper substrate
from the target composition tabulated in Table 1. A platinized titanium sheet (25 mm ×
25 mm × 1.5 mm) and a Cu sheet (25 mm × 25 mm × 0.3
mm) were employed as an anode and a cathode, respectively, and the
distance between the two electrodes was kept constant at 20 mm. First,
copper substrates were grounded sequentially with a sand paper and
then polished with a diamond paste to attain a mirror finish. Hard
cleansing of substrates with acetone was attained under ultrasonic
agitation. Second, the substrates were degreased in a solution containing
3.5 g/L NaOH and 2.5 g/L Na2CO3 for 2 min under
a galvanostatic mode. Finally, the substrates were subjected to activation
in 10% HCl solution for dozens of seconds and transferred to the bath
instantly. Sequential rinsing with distilled water was accomplished
onto the Cu substrates. During the electrodeposition process, the
temperature, pH, CD, and time were maintained constantly at 65 °C,
8, 5 A/dm2, and 15 min, respectively. Finally, the coated
samples were rinsed with deionized water, blown with cold air, and
desiccated for further characterization. The resultant coatings obtained
from the native plating bath (absence of the additive) and that with
additives (OPD and PPD) were termed as Ni–W, Ni–W/OPD,
and Ni–W/PPD, respectively, throughout the manuscript for brevity.

2.2 Film
Characterization
The Ni–W
alloy coatings without and with additives (Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD)
were subjected to analysis for surface roughness, morphology, elemental
composition, and phase structure, which are interrelated to their
electrochemical behavior toward corrosion resistance. The surface
appearance, cross-sectional morphology of coatings, substrate adhesion,
and elemental composition of the alloy coatings were investigated
using an FEI Inspect (MLA650F-Brooke Company, Germany) combined with
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The three-dimensional morphology
of electrodeposited coatings and the corresponding roughness parameters
were calculated using atomic force microscopy (AFM, VEECO D3100).
To evaluate the adsorption of additives on the outer layer of the
alloy surface and their elemental electronic state, XPS (Thermo Fisher)
equipped with an Al Kα radiation source is adopted. The presence
of organic compounds, i.e., functional groups grafted to the Ni–W
alloy matrix, was analyzed by a Nicolet NEXUS 870 FTIR (ATR). Furthermore,
the phase structure and the average crystalline size were accomplished
using XRD (Parnike X’pert PRO MPD) and the Debye–Scherer
equation (eq 1). Cu Kα
radiation was employed in a scanning range of 20–90° at
0.02°/s. 1  where d is the average grain
size, λ is the wavelength of X-rays, β is the full width
at half-maximum, and θ is the scattering angle.

Porosity
density (PD) in percentage (%) is given as 2  where
ΔE is the difference
between the corrosion potential of the alloy-coated sample and the
substrate, a is the anodic slope of the substrate,
and Rps and Rp are the polarization resistances of the substrate and the alloy
coatings, respectively. A conventional three-compartment pyrex cell
filled with 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was utilized
to perform electrochemical measurements (Tafel and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy, EIS) on a CHI-660C electrochemical work station.
A Ni–W specimen (0.5 cm2) as a working electrode,
a platinum electrode as a counter electrode, and a saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode were employed. Tafel measurements
were carried out at a potential of 200 mV relative to open-circuit
potential (OCP) and a constant scan rate of 10 mV/s using the potentiodynamic
polarization scan (PDS) technique. A signal amplitude perturbation
of 5 mV relative to the OCP in the frequency ranging from 1 to 1 00 000
Hz was adopted to carry out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements. EIS spectra (Nyquist and Bode plots) for the adopted
coatings were approximated using Z-View software, version 3. To ensure
the reproducibility of corrosion results, the electrochemical measurements
were conducted on three replications.

2.3 Corrosion
rate (CR) calculation
 3  where CR is the corrosion rate (Gamry default), Icorr is the corrosion current, K = 3272, EW is the equivalent weight in g/equiv, d is the density in g/cm3, and A is the
sample area in cm2.

2.4 Corrosion
rate (CR) calculation
Corrosion
efficiency (CE) calculation

The CE was calculated from the corrosion
current values using the following equation 4  where i0corr and icorr denote the
corrosion current
densities of Ni–W coatings obtained from the baths without
and with additives, respectively.

The calculation of CE from
the charge transfer resistance values
was performed using the following equation 5  where Rcti and Rct0 denote the charge-transfer resistances
of Ni–W coatings deposited
in the presence and absence of additives in the bath, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Tafel
Measurements
Figure 2 depicts the Tafel polarization
curves derived for the Ni–W alloy and Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD
composite coatings. The allied corrosion parameters extracted from
the Tafel curves after fitting with the equivalent circuit (Randles
circuit) are tabulated in Table 2. The data obtained from the
Tafel measurements provides a clear assessment of the rate of electron
transfer within the anodic and cathodic sites, anticipating the stability
of coatings when in contact with the corrosive species.30,31 Corrosion potential (Ecorr) is a measure
of corrosion susceptibility32 or a tendency
of the corrosion reaction.30 A higher positive
magnitude of Ecorr (−116, −118
mV) reported for the additive-assisted alloy matrix composite coatings
(Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD) suggests a very low vulnerability
toward corrosion attack compared with that of bare coatings (−380
mV). Relative to Ni–W (153.4 μA/cm2) and Ni–W/OPD
(9.22 μA/cm2), a obvious decrease in the corrosion
current density (Icorr) is observed for
Ni–W/PPD (4.68 μA/cm2), ascertaining the adsorption-blocking
action31 of the added additive with the
minimal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).33 The observed decrease in Icorr is in
line with the calculated corrosion rate (CR) values. The lowest CR
(0.083 mm/year) was recorded for Ni–W/PPD, explicating an exaggerated
impediment to the anodic dissolution, i.e., alloy dissolution,34 compared with that of bare (2.85 mm/year) and
Ni–W/OPD (0.166 mm/year) coatings. The higher the polarization
resistance (Rp), the higher the anticorrosion
property.35 In the current research work,
a higher and significant value of Rp (4963.3
Ω cm2) was attained for Ni–W/PPD compared
with that of bare ones (Rp 203.1 Ω
cm2), attributing to the full embodiment of the additive
into the alloy matrix interfacial area, mitigating the traverse of
corrosive species through the coating and to the substrate. A lower
value of Rp of 2917.4 Ω cm2 for Ni–W/OPD compared with that of Ni–W/PPD illustrates
the partial embodiment of the additive into the alloy matrix interfacial
area, corroborating to its lower corrosion efficiency (CE). The partial/full
embodiment of additives into the coverage area of the alloy surface
owes to the nature of positional isomeric spacers (ortho and para)
and is further discussed in the next section. A smaller value of porosity
density (PD) attained for Ni–W/PPD (3.7%) demonstrates that
the addition of PPD into the bath enhanced the formation of fine-grained
deposits with higher binding energy between the crystallographic planes.34 Thus, it is logical to conclude that the well-embedded
additive molecules have obstructed the diffusion of aggressive species
effectively.36

3.2 EIS Measurements
In using EIS to
get insight into the adsorption property of emoloyed additives and
their role in resisting the electrochemical degradation of coated
samples kinetically, i.e., ongoing interfacial reactions, the Nyquist
and Bode plots are the most common representations.21,37 Nyquist plots of Ni–W coatings obtained in their as-deposited
state and with the addition of OPD and PPD in the bath are displayed
in Figure 3. The graphs
display a single elliptical circle with a different radii, suggesting
a one time-constant process corresponding to the charge-transfer mechanism
at the interface of the corrosive electrolyte and coatings.38 In general, for this type of single time-constant
process, a widely used Randles circuit is used, which is reported
to be the best-fitted electrochemical equivalent circuit (EEC)21,38 containing Rq components. The executed
equivalent circuit consists of the following elements: Rs is the solution Ohmic resistance that is placed in series
with the parallel connection of charge transfer resistance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPEdl). The
relative radius of the impedance arc accounts for its anticorrosion
performance.39−41 The longest the diameter, meaning a decrease in the
surface area of coatings with the corrosive electrolyte, the superior
the corrosion performance. The extracted data from the proposed EEC
are presented in Table 3. As seen in Figure 3, the coatings of Ni–W/PPD exhibit the highest impedance,
depicting its anticorrosion ability with a maximum Rct value of 3316.71 Ω cm2. A smaller
impedance arc with a low Rct value of
2125.02 Ω cm2 obtained for Ni–W/OPD shows
its poor corrosion performance. Furthermore, the smallest impedance
arc in the case of bare coatings (Ni–W), with a lowest Rct value of 1610.44 Ω cm2,
illustrates the poorest corrosion performance. The charge-transfer
resistance is directly proportional to the surface diffusion of metal
adions/ternary precursors formed on the substrate surface42,43 A significant larger value of Rct of
−3316.71 Ω cm2 in the case of Ni–W/PPD
indicates the active role of PPD in the cathodic discharge process
or in the reduction of ternerary precursors.18,44−47 Furthermore, evidence for this is the lower value of CPEdl (22.05
μF/cm2) and higher value of n (0.93).
According to the literature,48 the CPEdl
value signifies the formation of dielectric constant/double layer
formation at the interface, while the n value corresponds
to the surface homogeneity and the capacitive nature of the coatings.49 Capacitance is directly proportional to the
area of the capacitor exposed to the corrosive solution.50 A lower CPEdl value in the case of Ni–W/PPD
confirms the effective adsorption of PPD onto the alloy surface, which
aids in increasing the thickness of double layer/decreasing the dielectric
constant that greatly suppresses the dissolution reaction of metallic
coatings (Ni–W). A higher exponent value (n = 0.93) confirms its lower porosity, compactness, and its capacitive
nature in defying the penetration of So42– ions. A slightly higher CPEdl value of 28.07 μF/cm2 (Ni–W/OPD) illustrates the emergence of a double layer with
lower thickness, depicting the fragmentary adsorption of OPD onto
the alloy surface, and a lower n value (0.90) for
the same coating represents its loose inner layer and relatively lower
capacitive nature, facilitating the flow of corrosive ions through
the micropores/cracks. The Ni–W coatings in the as-deposited
state resulted in the highest CPEdl value (70.46 μF/cm2) and lowest n value (0.82), indicating the formation
of a thin double layer at the interface and high roughness with a
very loose inner layer, developing the biggest microcracks/pores.
This result suggests the easy diffusion of corrosive species through
the coating, which evidences the poorer barrier action (bare one).
Impedance data obtained from the EEC reveals that Ni–W coatings
obtained in their as-deposited state are the most relegated one compared
with other coatings (Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD). Apparently,
quantitative evidence of larger Rct, smaller
CPEdl, and higher n exponent values for Ni–W/PPD coatings deploys
the characteristic role of PPD in the citrate-based Ni–W electrolyte.
As seen in Figure 4, the Bode phase plot of Ni–W/PPD displays one wide and broad
hump in comparison with that of Ni–W/OPD, which is attributable
to its compactness and uniform nature.51 The Ni–W bare coatings exhibit two time constants, pointing
out its highly porous nature, irregular coverage, and adsorption of
alloy coatings onto the copper substrate.52 Among the considered coatings, a higher phase angle (−80°)
and a slope of 3.6 are achieved for Ni–W/PPD, demonstrating
the capacitive behavior of the electrical double layer in mitigating
the passage of aggressive species through the coating and to the substrate
surface.53,54 Deviation from the ideal capacitive behavior,
i.e., −90°, may refer to the surface inhomogeneity of
the formed Ni–W coatings.55 In the
current research work, the executed additives possess similar molecular
structure but differ in regard to the nature of positional isomeric
spacers (ortho and para). A schematic representation of additive adsorption
onto the alloy surface is shown in Figure 5. Having a keen look at the molecular structures,
the adsorption of the OPD additive takes place through oxygen atoms.
However, in the case of PPD additive, both oxygen and nitrogen play
a synergetic role in the effective adsorption. The concept of chemisorption
comes into the picture, which involves a strong interaction through
ionic bonds between the adsorbate (organic molecule) and the adsorbent
(Ni–W surface). Here, the C=N functional group, where
N posseses relatively lower electronegativity and a large number of
lone pair of electrons, contributes to the high electronic density.56−58 Additionally, in both cases, π electrons in multiple bonds
and aromatic clouds and homo- and heteroatomic multiple bonds like
C–O, C–C, and C=C offer a strong coordination
with the alloy surface. However, between Ni–W/OPD and Ni–W/PPD,
the latter one resulted in a high charge-transfer resistance (3316.71
Ω cm2) and thus in its enhanced corrosion efficiency
(95.29%). Here, the positional isomeric spacer plays a crucial role
in effective chemisorption and therefore obstructs the corrosion process.
In the case of Ni–W/OPD coatings, the additive (OPD) possesses
a closer spacer or bonds that lead to ring strain and high steric
hindrance, diminishing the adsorption. However, in the case of Ni–W/PPD,
as the additive (PPD) possesses a large spacer between two naphthalene
rings, it exhibits lower steric hindrance and a lack of the ring strain
makes the adsorption predominant. Furthermore, the rapidly adsorbed/intercalated
PPD along with Ni–W ion matrixes forms a new grain that densifies
the grain boundary and fills the micropores/cracks during the electrodeposition
process, leading to the formation of uniform and bright electrodeposits.

3.3 Surface Morphology
Figure 6 depicts the
morphology data
of Ni–W alloy coatings fabricated from the electrolytes without
and with organic additives (OPD and PPD). For a clear observation,
the micrographs of Ni–W coatings are shown in lower and higher
magnifications and the calculated grain sizes are mentioned in the
corresponding micrographs. Figure 6a indicates that coatings of the as-deposited state
show high irregularity with a large-grained surface. Throughout the
surface, cluttered micropores were interspersed. Clear grain boundaries
with uneven nodules indicate their higher grain size and porosity
density (12.2%) (Table 2). The primary cause for these types of crystal defects is hydrogen
embrittlement, which extenuates the lateral growth of multiple islands,
resulting in incomplete cohesion or discontinuities.59 In contrast, the composite coatings of Ni–W/OPD
showed a significant difference in the morphology of the clear and
uniform surface with lesser cracks and smaller nodules. Here, the
employed additive played the principle role of a diffusing element
that intercalates or adsorbs into the alloy matrixes or on the surface
of the alloy and provides a larger surface area, reducing the grain
size and yielding lesser porosity density (6.3%). A partial decrease
in the grain boundary is visualized by the formation of a fine organic
layer during the process of electrodeposition. However, the composite
coating of Ni–W/PPD displayed a very smooth, compact, and homogeneous
morphology with a fewer nodules. Here, the additive PPD acted as a
rapidly diffusing element, reducing the surface energy, increasing
the nucleation rate, and resulting in a decrease in the defect density21 of Ni–W coatings. The full encapsulation
of the organic additive (PPD) into the Ni–W matrixes showed
a profound effect on the disappearance of the grain boundary with
even lesser porosity density (3.7%). Moreover, the additive helped
in the growth of multiple islands laterally, supporting the complete
cohesion and suggesting a planar surface with minimal coating defects.

high-magnification SEM images of the prepared films: (a)
Ni–W alloy, (b) Ni–W/OPD, and (c) Ni–W/PPD.

3.4 Cross-Sectional Observation
Concerning
the cross section, the morphologies of Ni–W coatings in their
as-deposited state and from the baths with added of OPD and PPD are
shown in Figure 7.
It illustrates that the morphology (Figure 7a) exhibits a more heterogeneous structure
with higher inclusions, larger pores, and segregated islands, making
the surface very loose. A coarse-grained microstructure with bestrewed
crystals makes the interface combination feeble, i.e., the adhesion
between the Ni–W coatings and Cu substrate becomes worse. One
of the possible strategies to lessen the coarsening problem is to
decrease the kinetic race between densification and grain growth.60 It was observed that the Ni–W/OPD coating
is compact and dense with a good sign of cohesion between the two
islands. A partial extenuation in the coarse graining is observed,
making the interface combination better compared with that of bare
alloy coatings. Here, the added additive helped in controlling the
growth of crystalline facets (Ni–W) kinetically through adsorption–desorption
interactions.61 Furthermore, the additive
molecule reduces the volume of hydrogen bubbles by adsorbing them
onto the cathode surface, leading to grain refinement. However, the
interface between the adsorbate and the adsorbent is not upto the
mark (uneven distribution of facets), making Ni–W alloy coatings
less corrosion resistant in comparison with Ni–W/PPD coatings.
Favorably, the Ni–W alloy coatings acquired from the bath containing
PPD show a fine planar structure with a good interface combination
among the Cu substrate, Ni–W coating, and organic layer. This
illustrates that the strongest adsorption of the PPD additive with
crystal planes at high speed rates encouraged the preferred development.59 Apparently, less microcracks, smallest pore
size, and absence of coarse grains reflect the significance of the
added additive (PPD). Furthermore, the decrease in the volume of H2 bubbles upon effective adsorption leads to the formation
of smooth and compact deposits without any evidence of bulk or interface
defects.59 Nevertheless, in all cases,
a few scratches were noticed that were formed during the substrate
pretreatment process and were inevitable.51

3.5 Elemental Analysis
A semiquantitative
elemental analysis of the Ni–W, Ni–W/OPD, and Ni–W/PPD
matrix composites was carried out with the aid of EDX, and the corresponding
spectra are shown in Figure 8. The obtained spectra illustrate that the elemental contents
of Ni–W in their as-deposited state are 72.82 wt % Ni and 27.18
wt % W. As for the composite coating contents, Ni is 67.55 wt % and
W is 32.45 wt % for Ni–W/OPD and Ni is 65.99 wt % and W is
34.01 wt % for Ni–W/PPD. A clear observation of an increase
in tungsten (wt %) is observed for the alloy coatings deposited from
the bath containing additives. In general, the alloy composition principally
depends on the transference number (ionic mobility and ionic concentration)
at the cathode–electrolyte interface.52 For the Ni–W alloy system, the ionic mobility of the Ni+2 citrate complex is faster than that of the WO42– citrate complex, which results in the lower
tungsten wt %.62 Another factor that relegates
the content of tungsten (27.18 wt %) is the evolution of H2 gas at the cathode–solution interface, as observed in several
other reports.63 However, the coatings
obtained in the presence of additives (OPD and PPD) resulted in a
higher W content, i.e., 32–34 wt %. Previous reports state
that electrodeposition of nickel and tungsten ions from the citrate-based
electrolytes is kinetically controlled by activation in the case of
former one (Ni+2) and by diffusion in the case of the latter
one (W+6), i.e., by adsorption or surface coverage process
of the cathode.10,44,64,65 Here, the added additive played a key role
as a hydrogen suppressor, providing a greater chance for tungsten
adsorption at the cathode–solution interface by increasing
the bulk metal ion concentration. Another factor that contributes
to the further increase in tungsten wt % (Ni–W/PPD) is the
increase of the surface activity of W ions compared with that of Ni

electrodeposition.

3.6 Phase Structure Analysis
Figure 9 shows registered
XRD spectra for Ni–W alloy coatings obtained in their as-deposited
state and from the plating electrolytes containing OPD and PPD. The
spectrum reveals the formation of three prominent peaks at 2⊖
angles of 43.9, 50.5, and 74.1° with a preferred grain orientation
of (111), (200), and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc)
structure. Among these, the (111) plane is the most preferred one,
where Ni–W is present as a single substitutional solid solution66 in which Ni acts as a solvent and W as a solute.67 A popular and well-known Debye–Scherer
equation has been implemented to calculate the crystalline size of
alloy deposits. The average crystalline sizes of the alloy coatings
in the descending order are Ni–W (36.1 nm) > Ni–W/OPD
(23.8 nm) > Ni–W/PPD (18.1 nm). Among these, a notably decrease
in the crystalline size is noticed in the case of alloy coatings deposited
from the PPD (additive)-doped bath. Herein, the added additives act
as a crystal modifier that aids the grain growth in a specific direction.59 In comparison with that of the bare one (Ni–W),
the appearance of a sharp, intensified peak corresponds to the more
crystalline nature.40 Broadening of the
X-ray diffraction line is ascribed to the reduction of crystallite
size, where the loaded additive molecules into the metal matrixes
inhibited the further growth of Ni crystallites by providing more
nucleation sites, resulting in grain refinement.43 The highly intensified and sharpened peaks at (111) and
(220) were observed for the Ni–W/PPD coating, confirming its
highest deposition rate68 and the preferred
grain orientation in a specific direction. Another factor that influences
the crystalline size of the Ni–W alloy system is the wt % of
the tungsten.14 The measured reflection
(220) plane intensity is found to be depended on the tungsten content.63 In the present study, it followed the same trend
(Table 4); the (220)
plane intensity increases with the increase in wt % of tungsten, resulting
in a small crystallite size (Ni–W/PPD). In summary, the XRD
spectra revealed that the addition of OPD and PPD into the Ni–W
ion solution has not much influenced the peak position, illustrating
a similar phase structure with no obvious lattice disorder.40

3.7 Surface Roughness
Precise information
on the surface, growth behavior, and roughness of Ni–W alloy
coatings has been obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The parameters
corresponding to the roughness of the obtained electrodeposits are
tabulated in Table 4. By careful observation of the topography (Figure 10a) of the samples, Ni–W coatings
in the as-deposited state exhibit large, protruding, globular grains
with a maximum height of 183.61 nm. The average surface roughness
(Ra) and root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values of the same are 20.6 and 26.4 nm,
respectively. The obtained results posit that the surface shows the
evidence of high heterogeneity because of varied deposition rates
between the clusters of nucleus and a lack of nuclei during the budding
stage of the electrodeposition process, resulting in a nonuniform
electrocrystallization.15 The roughness
of Ni–W/OPD (Figure 10b) slightly decreased with an average value of Ra of 19.83 nm and Rq of 24.72
nm. However, the topography displays lesser microcones with a minimal
protruding site value of 174.82 nm. This illustrates that the OPD
in the bath had partially codeposited into the Ni–W alloy matrix,
providing a surface area for the reduction of metal ions and yielding
a uniform structure with a reduced Rz value
of 174.82 nm in comparison with that of the neat composite (Ni–W).
On the contrary, the alloy deposits (Figure 11) obtained from the bath containing PPD
displayed a smooth topography, resulting from the generation of a
conical array of thinner and shorter microcones. This showed strikingly
different roughness values of Ra of 15.67
nm and Rq of 19.35 nm. A considerable
decrease in the surface roughness can be visualized with a maximum
height of Rz of 140.0 nm, which can be
ascribed to the full codeposition of the PPD additive into the Ni–W
alloy matrixes, and no obvious cracks or defects have been detected,
representing the formation of a compact and dense protective film
on the alloy surface with a greater surface coverage area. Finally,
the coatings with admirable characteristics (shiny look and uniform
surface homogeneity) alludes the concomitant goal of the employed
additives in the Ni–W ion solution.

alloy films obtained from the Ni–W
ion solution in the absence (a) and presence of OPD (b).

3.8 FTIR Analysis
The incorporation of
the additive (PPD) in the Ni–W alloy matrixes during electrodeposition
is ascertained using FTIR spectroscopy. A comparative analysis of
FTIR spectra of the as-synthesized PPD additive (a) and Ni–W
alloy matrix loaded with the additive (b) is presented in Figure 12. The absorption
peak at 1050 cm–1 can be assigned to the C–N
stretching vibration, while the strong absorption peak between 1500
and 1520 cm–1 corresponds to C=C stretching
vibrations of the benzene ring. The high-intensity band at 1690 cm–1 demonstrates the presence of C=N (amine group),
which ascribes to the formation of coordinate covalent bonding through
the adsorption of the additive molecule onto the alloy matrix. Moreover,
the appearance of a sharp peak at 3560 cm–1 gives
clear evidence of the presence of the OH group, supporting the evidence
of adsorption or inclusion of the additive molecule. More specifically,
throughout the spectra, a shift of peaks toward higher intensity was
observed, concluding the grafting of hydroxyl, amine, and alkene functionalities.

films (b).

3.9 XPS Analysis
Surface elements play
a pertinent role in determining the protection efficiency of metallic
coatings. Herein, XPS has been utilized to explore the surface element
electronic state and the corresponding adsorbed organic species. Figure 13a displays the
wide XPS spectrum of Ni–W/PPD composite coatings, indicating
the presence of Ni, W, N, C, and O. The deconvoluted spectra of the
above-stated elements are represented in Figures 13b,c and 14a–c.
As can be seen in Figure 13b, the Ni 2p3/2 spectrum shows three photoelectron
peaks at 852.6, 855.8, and 861.7 eV, corresponding to the metallic
nickel (Ni(0)), nickel oxides (NiO) and hydroxides (Ni(OH)2), and complex nickel satellite.43 The
appearance of a peak at 852.6 eV demonstrates that the added additive
(PPD) aided in the reduction of nickel ions (Ni+2) to metallic
nickel (Ni(0)). Nevertheless, the presence of NiO/Ni(OH)2 ascribes to the formation of the corresponding oxide layer, which
is beneficial in increasing its corrosion efficiency (CE, 95.90%). Figure 13c shows the W 4f
spectrum having four decomposed peaks. The peak at 31.6 eV is assigned
to the metallic tungsten, W(0). Furthermore, the peaks at around 33.7,
35.5, and 37.6 eV correspond to the formation of various oxidation
states of tungsten.43 A highly intensified
and distinct peak at 31.6 eV illustrates that the additive aided in
actuating the reduction process (W6+ to W0)
proficiently. Trace amounts of W4+ and W6+ were
also detected, which evidenced the incomplete reduction of tungsten
(W6+) during the electrodeposition process.38 The N 1s spectrum (Figure 14a) depicts three distinct fitted peaks located
at the binding energies of 397.6 and 399.8 eV. A notable peak at 399.8
eV corresponds to the C=N (amine) group of the organic species,
which is one of the key promoters in binding of the organic molecule
onto the alloy surface.42,69 The second peak at
399.0 eV corresponds to the C–N=C bond of the aromatic
ring.70 Finally, a combined peak at 397.6
eV corresponds to the presence of C–N/=N– (unprotonated),
originated from the adsorption of the additive (PPD).34 The decomposed O 1s spectrum (Figure 14b) shows peaks between 529.0 and 534.0 eV.
An obvious peak at 530.7 eV corresponds to the O–Ni (W) species
that evidences the Ni–W alloy matrixes.51 Two prominent peaks at 531.6 and 531.7 eV could be assigned
to OH and H2O species, respectively.51,71 These species were derived from the aqueous electrolyte during the
process of electrochemical deposition, which is inevitable. The appearance
of a OH peak further confirms the stronger adsorption of organic species
onto the alloy surface. A small peak appearing at lower binding energy
(529.6 eV) can be ascribed to the O–C bond,31 which may be originated from the inorganic compounds such
as citrates or urea that are used during bath preparation. Additionally,
the C 1s spectrum, shown in Figure 14c, had provided some more information about the degree
of oxidation. Distinct doublet peaks at 284.0 and 285.5 eV correspond
to the C=C/C–C bonds of the aromatic ring.30,72 The binding energies of 285.1 and 288.3 eV correspond to the C–N
and C–O bonds, respectively,31,51 indicating
the adsorption of the organic additive (PPD) during electrodeposition.
In sum, the obtained XPS spectrum suggests the chemisorption of the
PPD additive onto the alloy surface, and furthermore, the presence
of OH and C=N states indicates the additive–alloy surface
interaction.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we used two novel additives (OPD and PPD) as barrier-reinforcing
dopants in the citrate-based Ni–W ion solution. Comparative
analysis of the barrier effect of neat Ni–W and additive-introduced
nanocomposite coatings was performed using Tafel and EIS and further
confirmed by FESEM, XPS, AFM, and FTIR. Interfacial interaction of
the adsorbate onto the alloy surface occurred through the sharing
of electrons via a dative bond, and it varied based on its positional
isomeric spacer. As for the Ni–W/PPD case, a uniformly distributed
robust and efficient anticorrosive coating was formed via the dative
bond as a result of a decrease in the steric hindrance and the crowding
effect, with a larger isomeric spacer, portraying the chemical versatility.
The preferred grafting and surface adsorption of functional groups
ascribe to the reduction of porosity density (3.7%), as demonstrated
by XPS and FTIR techniques. The improved affinity between the adsorbate
and the adsorbent (organic molecule and alloy surface) induced by
a larger isomeric spacer leads to the formation of a stable chemisorbed
organic layer that effectively intercepted the electrolyte diffusion.
It is believed that the developed additive (similar in geometry but
with varying isomeric spacers) endowed Ni–W alloy coatings
with eminent corrosion-resistant property in the simulated corrosive
environment and could be a great upliftment to produce other binary
or ternary alloy coatings with enhanced robust barrier performance.
