Tannic acid is a calcite flotation
agent widely used in mineral
processing. To better understand the physicochemical reactivity of
tannic acid toward calcite, the present work focused on studying the
mechanisms involved during the adsorption process. Hence, in order
to determine the optimal physicochemical parameters, tannic acid adsorption
onto calcite was investigated at various experimental conditions such
as contact time, initial tannic acid concentration, solution pH, particle
size, and temperature. The obtained results showed that the adsorption
capacity of tannic acid increased significantly with initial tannic
acid concentration. Furthermore, tannic acid adsorption onto calcite
was highly dependent on solution pH, and the optimal adsorption amount
was found to be at pH 8. Therefore, the behavior controlling the studied
adsorption process could be attributed to ion exchange. Moreover,
the adsorption mechanism has been determined by isothermal, kinetic,
and thermodynamic studies. Thus, the Sips isotherm model was the one
that best predicted equilibrium data. Adsorption kinetics followed
a pseudo-second-order model, indicating that the adsorption process
was controlled by the chemical reaction. The estimated thermodynamic
parameters revealed that the adsorption reaction was exothermic in
nature and the system entropy decreased nonsignificantly during this
process. Based on these results, the study of the physicochemical
interaction between tannins and carbonates has potential application
in mineral processing as well as in other fields.

1 Introduction
Flotation is known to
have an increasing emphasis in ores’
valorization through the adsorption of chemical reagents, including
sodium oleate as a collector and acidized sodium silicate as a depressant,
on mineral surfaces. Unfortunately, some of these chemicals are expensive
and may affect the environment as well as human health.1 Thus, the use of environment-friendly reagents,
such as tannins, is a sustainable alternative. Tannins can be defined
as polyphenolic groups that can be derived from the breakdown of plant
biomass, containing fruits, roots, seeds, and bark.2 Because of their high number of adjacent hydroxyl groups,
tannins present a specific affinity to metal ions,3−5 including calcium
ion. On the other hand, calcite is one of the most calcium-containing
minerals and an important component of sedimentary rocks, which can
be treated with tannins, such as quebracho, tannic acid, valonea,
and so forth.

Indeed, quebracho tannin has been used as an effective
depressant
in the flotation process for the separation of scheelite, fluorite,
and calcite.6 The experimental study of
the effect of tannic acid as a depressant on the fluorite flotation
behavior showed that the acidic conditions significantly enhanced
the selective depression of calcite.7 Tannic
acid adsorption onto calcite has also been studied by photoelectric
spectroscopy, which revealed that the hydroxyl groups of tannins are
preferentially adsorbed on calcite sites.8 Furthermore, tannic acid has been used in the reverse flotation
of phosphates as an efficient method to separate phosphates from carbonates.9 In a recent study of valonea, tannin adsorption
was seen on fluorite as well as barite and calcite, and it is noted
that zeta potential measurements showed a stronger affinity of tannins
toward calcite compared to those of barite and fluorite.10 On the other hand, many studies were carried
out on tannin adsorption in water treatment, which revealed a strong
interaction between various substrates and tannins, among which the
substrates considered included activated carbon, clays, bentonites,
collagen fibers, deacetylated Konjac glucomannan, carbon, and so forth.11−22 However, none of the previously cited work related to mineral processing
shows clearly the mechanism of tannin adsorption.

The goal of
the present work is to carry out a detailed experimental
study of tannic acid adsorption onto calcite in order to better understand
the surface physicochemical phenomena involved during tannin use in
mineral processing. To this end, the effect of significant physicochemical
parameters (solution pH, contact time, particle size, initial tannic
acid concentration, and temperature) on the adsorption behavior was
studied to achieve the optimal conditions. The obtained results were
then exploited to determine the adsorption mechanism by isothermal,
kinetic, and thermodynamic investigations.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Contact Time Effect
The contact time
effect on the adsorption capacity of tannic acid studied at room temperature
is represented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Contact time effect on adsorption (Ctannic acid = 100 mg/L; Ccalcite = 10 g/L; pH =
8; particle sizecalcite = +40–80 μm; room
temperature).

This figure shows that tannic
acid adsorption kinetic can be delimited
into three steps. The first step of about few minutes was extremely
rapid during which 75.5% of tannic acid was adsorbed onto calcite.
Then, a slow step followed progressively until the adsorption process
achieved the equilibrium. The initial rapid adsorption can be explained
by the availability of active sites for tannic acid adsorption onto
calcite.23 While the slow adsorption behavior
observed in the second step can be attributed to the decrease in the
number of active sites of the adsorbent.24 The equilibrium time of tannic acid adsorption on the calcite mineral
was finally found to be equal to 30 min. This value was considered
as an appropriate contact time used for further experiments.

2.2 Particle Size Effect
Figure 2 indicates the adsorption capacity
variation of tannic acid obtained as a function of initial tannic
acid concentration for two different calcite particle size ranges.

Figure 2 Particle
size effect on adsorption (tcontact =
30 min; pH = 8; Ctannic acid =
100 mg/L; room temperature; Ccalcite =
10 g/L).

It can be seen from the obtained
results that the adsorbed tannic
acid increases as the calcite particle size decreases. This may be
due to a large number of smaller particles which lead to more available
exchange surface in the adsorption system.25

2.3 Initial Tannic Acid Concentration Effect
At room temperature, the initial tannic acid concentration effect
on adsorption is given in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Initial tannic acid concentration effect on adsorption
(tcontact = 30 min; Ccalcite = 10 g/L pH = 8; particle sizecalcite = +40–80
μm; room temperature).

These results show clearly that the adsorption capacity of tannic
acid increases with initial concentration until equilibrium. This
was reached at 200 mg/L of initial tannic acid concentration. The
increase of adsorbed tannic acid was probably due to the increase
of the adsorbate concentration gradient between the solution and adsorbent
surface.26,27 On the other hand, the equilibrium was related
to the saturation of active adsorption sites at adsorbate higher concentration.24,26

2.4 Modeling of Adsorption Isotherms
In order
to describe the tannic acid adsorption mechanism onto calcite,
three adsorption isotherm models were tested in the present study:
Langmuir,28−30 Freundlich,31 and Sips.32 The Langmuir isotherm model assumed that the
adsorption occurs on a homogeneous surface by monolayer adsorption.
Furthermore, the adsorption sites are well determined, identical,
and energetically equivalent33 without
interaction between adsorbed molecules.34 This model is written as 1  where Ce (mg/L)
is the equilibrium adsorbate concentration, q (mg/g)
is the equilibrium adsorbed amount per unit of adsorbent mass, qmax (mg/g) is the maximum adsorption capacity,
and KL (L/g) is the Langmuir constant.

On the other hand, the Freundlich isotherm model is based on a
multilayer adsorption on a heterogeneous surface.35 Its equation is given by 2  where Kf [(mg/g)/(mg/L)1/n] and n are the Freundlich
constant indicators of adsorption capacity and intensity, respectively.

The Sips model is a combination between Freundlich and Langmuir.
At low sorbate concentrations, it reduces to Freundlich isotherm,
whereas at high sorbate concentrations, it is assimilated to Langmuir
isotherm.36,37 The Sips model is represented by 3  where n and Ks (L/mg) are the heterogeneity index and the adsorption
affinity constant, respectively.

The adsorption isotherms are
obtained by the graphical representation
of the equilibrium adsorbed tannic acid as a function of the equilibrium
solution concentration at different values of initial solution pH
(Figure 4).

Figure 4 Tannic acid
adsorption isotherms onto calcite at different values
of solution pH.

It can be seen from Figure 4 in alkaline medium (pH 8 and
10) that the adsorbed tannic
acid increases slightly at low concentrations, which may be due to
low tannic acid concentrations. However, it increases drastically
at pH 8 after the equilibrium tannic acid concentration of 10 mg/L
before stabilizing gradually at an adsorption capacity of approximately
13 mg/g corresponding probably to an adsorption site saturation, whereas
at pH 6, the adsorbed tannic acid increases gradually with the equilibrium
tannic acid concentration reaching an equilibrium amount of 7.64 mg/g.

To get through the interaction system between tannic acid and the
calcite surface, the previously mentioned models (Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Sips) have been tested on the basis of experimental equilibrium
data using the nonlinear fitting method (Figure 5).

isotherms onto calcite
at different values of pH solution. (a) pH 6, (b) pH 8, (c) pH 10.

The obtained estimated parameters of the models
are represented
in Table 1.

Table 1 Sips Model Parameters at Different
Values of pH Solution
pH	R2	KL (L/mg)	qm (mg/g)	R2	KF [(mg/g)/(mg/L)1/n]	n	R2	Ks (L/mg)	n	qm (mg/g)	
 	Langmuir	Freundlich	Sips	
6	0.9861	0.02	10.81	0.9943	0.52	1.78	0.9947	0.02	1.52	29.04

10	0.9924	0.01	4.76	0.973	0.14	1.64	0.9925	0.008	0.87	4.10	
The latter shows clearly
that the Sips model is the best one, which
describes tannic acid adsorption onto calcite (R2 close to 1) for different tested solution pH values. The
same result was obtained by tannic acid adsorption study on zeolite.38Table 1 indicates that the adsorbed amount changes in terms of pH.
At pH 6, a high adsorption amount of 29.08 mg/g is reached, whereas
at pH 8 and 10, the adsorbed amounts are 13.55 and 4.10 mg/g, respectively.
It can be concluded that tannic acid adsorption onto calcite is highly
dependent on pH solution. This may be due to different positive and
negative surface species of calcite (CaOH+2,
CaHCO3, CaOH, and CaCO–3)
as a function of pH solution.39

Because
of the dissolution of calcite in acidic medium,40 the high adsorbed amount at pH 6 can be attributed
to the adsorption process as well as the precipitation reaction. Effectively,
some researchers showed that at the pH value of 5, the precipitation
of polyfunctional tannins with metal ions including the calcium ion
Ca2+ may be involved.41,42 At pH 8, a
weak tannic acid is completely ionized.43 However, the calcite surface becomes less positive (zeta potential
≈ 4 mV) than at pH 6 (zeta potential ≈12 mV).44 Thus, a lower affinity (2.89 × 10–5 L/mg) and a decrease of the adsorbed amount were observed. Under
these conditions, the n low value was also observed.
This resulted in a weak attraction between tannic acid and calcite.45 In alkaline medium (pH 10), calcite active sites
are negative,39 and tannic acid phenolic
groups become more reactive.46 This leads
to a low adsorption affinity because of the repulsion between tannic
acid hydroxyl groups and calcite negative species (CaCO–3). Moreover, a competition between hydroxyl groups of
both basic medium and tannic acid can occur. All these results show
that the interaction between tannic acid functional groups and calcite
surface species can be attributed to an ion exchange mechanism. Furthermore,
the obtained appropriate pH value of tannic acid adsorption onto calcite
is 8. The same pH value was obtained in the study of phenol adsorption
on coal ash by Sharan et al.47

2.5 Kinetic Study
Kinetics are an important
characteristic in adsorption mechanism studies. To this end, the pseudo-first
and -second-order models are most commonly used.48,49 4   5  where qe and q (mg/g)
are the adsorbed amounts at equilibrium and time,
respectively, t (min) is the adsorption process time,
and k1 and k2 (min–1) are pseudo-first and -second-order adsorption
rate constants, respectively. These two equations can be given for
the pseudo-nth-order model by50 6  

The integration of eq 7 is written as 7  

In this work, the general nth-order model was used to predict
the
obtained experimental data of adsorbed tannic acid as a function of
time at different initial tannic acid concentrations (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Pseudo-nth-order model
of tannic acid adsorption onto calcite at
various initial tannic acid concentrations (Ccalcite = 10 g/L; particle sizecalcite = +40–80
μm; pH = 8; room temperature).

Kinetic parameters (qe, n, and k) were estimated by minimizing the sum of
squared error between calculated and experimental values using Microsoft
Excel Solver and are represented in Table 2.

Table 2 Pseudo-nth-Order
Model Parameters
at Different Initial Tannic Acid Concentrations
 	qe (mg/g)

125	9.92	9.81	2.16	0.53	0.9996	
175	13.24	13.35	2.03	0.27	0.9998	
Figure 6 shows good
agreement between experimental results and the pseudo-nth-order kinetic
model. This is confirmed by the high determination coefficient (R2 > 0.9996) (Table 2). Table 2 indicates that for all tested concentrations, experimental
and calculated values of adsorbed tannic acid at equilibrium (qe) are very close. In addition, the reaction
order is very close to 2, which means that the pseudo-second-order
model is the best one to predict the investigated adsorption kinetics.
Therefore, the adsorption mechanism is a chemisorption process where
tannic acid molecules are linked by covalent bonds with calcite surface
atoms.51 This result is similar to that
obtained by tannin adsorption onto treated coal fly ash.52

2.6 Thermodynamic Study
In addition to
the isothermal and kinetic studies, the adsorption thermodynamic aspect
of tannic acid onto calcite was also investigated. The Gibbs free
energies G (kJ/mol) were evaluated by the Gibbs–Helmholtz
expression 8  where K (L/mg) is the equilibrium
constant evaluated from Sips parameters (Ks)53 (Table 3), T (Kelvin) is the temperature,
and R (8.314 J/mol K) is the universal gas constant.

Table 3 Sips Parameters at Various Temperatures
 	Langmuir	Freundlich	Sips	
temperature
(K)	R2	R2	R2	Ks (L/mg)	n	qm (mg/g)	
303	0.9855	0.9901	0.9983	2.91 × 10–4	0.57	11.70	
313	0.9713	0.9629	0.9944	2.69 × 10–4	0.48	9.17	
323	0.9375	0.9655	0.9962	3.45 × 10–7	0.29	8.06	
333	0.9307	0.9325	0.9989	8.51 × 10–8	0.26	5.67	
Comparing
the three tested models at different temperatures, it
is clearly shown that the Sips model gave the best description of
the mechanism of tannic acid adsorption onto calcite (R2 close to 1, see Table 3).

On the other hand, the adsorbed amount and
the affinity constant
(Ks) decrease with temperature. This can
be explained by an exothermic adsorption process.45 Thus, the value of n decreases as a function
of temperature, and consequently, the affinity becomes low at high
temperatures.45

The enthalpy ΔH (kJ/mol) and the entropy
ΔS (kJ/mol·K) were determined from the
slope and the intercept of Van’t Hoff representation (Figure 7) using the following
equations 9   10  

Figure 7 Van’t Hoff plot (tcontact =
30 min; Ccalcite = 10 g/L; particle sizecalcite = +40–80 μm; pH = 8).

The calculated thermodynamic parameter values are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4 Thermodynamic Parameters for Tannic
Acid Adsorption onto Calcite at Different Temperatures
T (K)	ΔG° (kJ/mol)	ΔH° (kJ/mol)	ΔS° (kJ/mol·K)	
303	20.52	–233.86	–0.84	
313	21.43	 	 	
323	39.91	 	 	
333	44.94	 	 	
The obtained
ΔG positive values indicate
a nonspontaneous low interaction between calcite and tannic acid.
This indicates the presence of an energy barrier via the retention
process.54 The negative value of ΔH (−233.86 kJ/mol) confirms the exothermic nature
of tannic acid adsorption.55 The absolute
value of ΔH also permits to distinguish between
the physical and chemical adsorption nature.56 Hence, the values between 8 and 25 kJ/mol show a physical adsorption,
whereas the values between 83 and 830 kJ/mol indicate a chemisorption
process. In our study, the high value of ΔH shows a chemical adsorption process. The negative sign of the ΔS value (−0.84 kJ/mol·K) suggests a nonsignificant
decrease in the freedom degree at the solid–liquid interface
during adsorption.45 Furthermore, the low
value of ΔS reveals that no significant change
occurred during tannic acid adsorption onto calcite.53 These results are similar to those obtained by tannin adsorption
onto coal ash.52

3 Conclusions
The present study investigated the adsorption
performance of tannic
acid onto calcite. Experimental results indicated an adsorption capacity
of 13.36 mg/g using optimal conditions of adsorption parameters. Adsorption
isothermal data agreed well with the Sips model, with a high determination
coefficient (R2 close to 1), suggesting
an adsorption capacity of 13.54 mg/g at room temperature and at pH
8 which is very close to that obtained experimentally. Furthermore,
tannic acid adsorption onto calcite is strongly dependent on solution
pH. Thus, the mechanism controlling tannic acid adsorption is an ion
exchange. Moreover, adsorption kinetics of tannic acid can be well
described by the pseudo-second-order model at different initial tannic
acid concentrations. Therefore, tannic acid molecules are linked by
covalent bonds with calcite surface atoms. On the other hand, thermodynamic
study indicated an exothermic and a chemical adsorption process. All
these results could be used to better understand the interaction between
tannins and carbonates and thus to achieve good performance in terms
of optimal conditions of adsorption in mineral processing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Adsorbent Preparation
Calcite sample
was obtained from the El hammam mine located about 80 km of Meknes
in Morocco. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the mineral was carried
out (Figure 8).

Figure 8 XRD pattern
of calcite.

The obtained result confirms the
calcite purity. The sample was
crushed using a jaw and cylindrical crusher, ground in a mechanical
grounder and then sieved to several fractions in order to collect
the +40–80 and +80–160 μm particle sizes for further
investigations.

4.2 Adsorbate Preparation
Tannic acid
(C76H52O46) was used as a representative
organic reagent supplied from Sigma-Aldrich. Its molecular weight
is 1701.20 Da. Its physicochemical analysis was done using Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (Figure 9).

Figure 9 FT-IR spectra of tannic acid.

This shows the presence of five characteristic bands corresponding
to carboxylic groups of tannic acid. The latter was dehydrated in
an oven at 95 °C for 1 h. Tannic acid (1 g) was dissolved in
100 mL of distilled water to prepare a 1% (w/v) stock solution, which
was then diluted in distilled water to obtain desired concentrations.

4.3 Adsorption Procedure
For each investigated
experiment, 1 g of calcite was added to 100 mL of required initial
tannic acid concentration in a pyrex beaker (250 mL) at room temperature
and fixed solution pH. The adsorbent–adsorbate mixture was
shaken at 250 rpm for 30 min to achieve adsorption equilibrium. The
obtained solution was then decanted and analyzed by UV–vis
spectrophotometry at 278 nm to determine the equilibrium tannic acid
concentration. The adsorption capacity of tannic acid was calculated
by 11  where Ci and Ce (mg/L) are the initial and equilibrium tannic
acid concentrations, respectively, V (L) is the solution
volume, and m (g) is the adsorbent mass.

The
study of the parameters affecting the tannic acid adsorption onto
calcite was considered at different experimental conditions. The kinetic
monitoring was performed during different time intervals ranging from
0 to 60 min using an initial tannic acid concentration of 100 mg/L.
The adsorbent particle size effect was studied for two fractions of
+40–80 and +80–160 μm. The initial tannic acid
concentration effect was investigated in the range from 5 to 200 mg/L
at different values of solution pH (6, 8, and 10). Moreover, the kinetic
study was conducted at different contact time intervals (0–20
min) and with various initial tannic acid concentrations from 50 to
175 mg/L. The temperature effect was studied within the temperature
range between 30 and 60 °C.

4.4 Statistical
Analysis
The study of
the parameters affecting the tannic acid adsorption onto calcite was
performed in triplicate. All graph data were expressed as the mean
of the triplicate, and standard deviations were analyzed statistically
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey
test at the 5% level. Any differences with p >
0.05
were not considered to be statistically significant.
