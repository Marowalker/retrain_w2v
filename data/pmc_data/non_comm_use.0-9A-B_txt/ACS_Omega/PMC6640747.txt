We investigate the
coupling of dipole resonances induced in a heteromaterial system composed
of a high-refractive-index nanoparticle and a highly reflective substrate.
A broad scattering signal and strong electric near-field enhancement
in the near-infrared region are generated by a hybrid Si nanoparticle
on a gold-film system under oblique illumination. Dark-field microscopy
investigations of the scattering signal measurement reveal the resonance
shifts of the dipole mode of silicon nanoparticles on gold films.
Further, the scattering signal is enhanced for p-polarized illumination
in the near-infrared region. The results indicate that the coupling
of Si nanoparticles on a gold-film system facilitates a possible application
for both surface-enhanced fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman
scattering.

Introduction
Electromagnetic scattering from nanostructures made of high-refractive-index
materials has received considerable attention in the field of nanophotonics
toward the control and manipulation of light in the near and far fields.1,2 Such nanostructures afford a simple approach to generate magnetic
resonances at optical frequencies in addition to dominant electric
resonant modes in metal plasmonic materials.3 It is well known from Mie theory that light incident on high-refractive-index
dielectric nanoparticles induces a strong magnetic dipole (MD) and
electric dipole (ED) in the nanoparticles. The frequency of
the dipole resonances are dependent on the particle sizes1,2,4−8 and shapes.9 In this context,
it has been recently demonstrated that MDs parallel to the magnetic
field of light incident on silicon nanoparticles can generate a ring-shaped
electric field distribution.1,2,7,10−13 The most common
example of MD radiation is the induction of electromagnetic waves
by excited metal split-ring resonators.14 The MDs of high-refractive-index particles provide convenient magnetic
scattering, which can be utilized for applications such as nanoantennas,
metamaterials,15 and metasurfaces. Although
the near-field enhancement in metallic nanostructures utilized in
plasmonics is stronger than that obtained with high-refractive-index
nanostructures,16 the far-field scattering
signal is fairly strong for high-refractive-index materials. In comparison
with metal nanostructures,16−25 the primary advantage of high-refractive-index materials is reduced
heat generation because of the low-loss characteristic26 of such materials, which aids in increasing
the reliable response of the target molecules with reduced heating
and quenching in surface-enhanced spectroscopies.

The scattering
patterns of high-refractive-index nanoparticles have been investigated
with regard to coupling between EDs and MDs toward yielding single-directional
scattering.1,6,9,12,20,27−29 The
silicon asymmetric dimers have been demonstrated to enhance and guide
forward scattering in both theory and experiment.30,31 In
addition, Janus dimers with two different materials, such as dimers
composed of gold and silicon, have also been observed to enhance forward
scattering.12 However, it is difficult
to fabricate such asymmetric dimers and heterodimers, and, further,
the influence of the substrates on which the particles are deposited
has not thus far been considered. In fact, the resonance
of nanostructures will shift as a result of the effect of the substrate
with different incident polarizations.32 In this regard, several recent studies have focused on the coupling
effect of high-refractive-index nanoparticles with various films deposited
on substrates. For instance, silicon nanoparticles placed in air,
on glass, on silicon, and on a perfect electric conductor (PEC) yield
different scattering performances.33 The
influence of substrates with high reflectivity is significant because
of the additional dipole resonance induced by the mirror effect.34 As regards structures comprising high-refractive-index
nanoparticles on metal substrates, silicon nanoparticles on silver
substrates have chiefly formed the focus of many studies.7 However, the different modes of dipoles interacting
with metal films have not thus far been analyzed in detail. Previous
studies have mainly focused on in-plane EDs under normal light incidence.7,13 With dark-field microscopy measurements under oblique incidence,
the reduction in the strength of the in-plane EDs becomes significant.
Therefore, scattering from Si nanoparticles under oblique excitation
can provide strong electric near-field enhancement generated by out-of-plane
EDs in the small gap between the nanoparticles and the metal films.

In this study, we utilize the interaction of silicon nanoparticles
with metal films under oblique excitation to enhance the electric
near-field. We systematically describe the highly localized electric-field
enhancements generated by strong dipole resonances between the silicon
nanoparticles and the metal film. As per our finite element method
(FEM) calculation results, the dipole resonances coupling between
silicon nanoparticles and metal films are dependent on the dielectric
constants of the films. Moreover, the electric-field enhancement at
the interface between the nanoparticles and the films is affected
by the direction of the dipole. In our experiments, we
acquire the scattering spectra and images of scattering with dark-field
microscopy under both p-polarized (p-pol) and s-polarized (s-pol)
excitations to probe the existence of dipole resonances. We also discuss
the scattering cross-section spectra of silicon nanoparticles placed
on a gold thin film at different angles of incidence in both p-pol
and s-pol illumination.

Methods
In our study, light scattering from spherical Si nanoparticles is
based on the Mie scattering theory. In addition, the scattering signal
can be decomposed into multipolar contributions as follows35  Here, k represents the wave vector, and an and bn represent the scattering coefficients of
the electric and magnetic multipolar contributions, respectively.
For nanoparticles with sizes considerably smaller than the incident
wavelength, only the first two terms are generally relevant. In our
simulation study, it is assumed that the nanoparticles are made of
crystalline silicon, and the ED and MD resonances are controlled in
the visible region by varying the particle sizes. To acquire the scattering
spectra of a single nanoparticle on the substrate, we performed numerical simulations
using the commercial software package COMSOL Multiphysics v4.3b in
the frequency domain. The simulation is separated into two procedures
to determine the change of energy on the particle surface. First,
the background of the light source is calculated without the presence
of the silicon nanoparticle. Once the background field has been calculated,
the nanoparticle is placed in the module, and the calculated background
field is used to calculate the scattering field. After completion
of the two procedures, the scattering cross-sections are defined by
integrating the change of energy on the nanoparticle surface. In the
simulations, the silicon nanoparticles placed on substrates were excited
by p-pol and s-pol light (Figure 1), with the angle of incidence being set at 70°.

Figure 1 Schematic of the physical system considered in the FEM
simulations in this study. Silicon nanoparticles are placed on a glass
substrate on which a gold thin film is deposited, and this system
is illuminated by a polarized light wave.

The scattering spectra of silicon nanoparticles with radius r (=65 nm) on different materials are presented in Figure 2, including 40 nm
thick gold, silver, and PEC films, all of which got deposited on a
glass substrate (refractive index = 1.52). Those spectra indicate
the distinct influence of the thin film on the scattering. The results
indicate that the primary ED and MD resonances appear at 470 and 560
nm, respectively, on all substrates.30,36 Even for different
polarizations, the resonance wavelengths of ED and MD do not shift.
However, with the oblique incidence, the ED corresponding to the out-of-plane
field component (ED⊥) is induced at around 500 nm
due to resonance between the nanoparticle and the PEC.33 As the resonance wavelength of the MD is close
to that of the ED⊥, the total scattering cross-section
significantly increases. From Figure 2a, it is evident that the contribution of ED⊥ from Si nanoparticles coupling with PEC and metals is a broadband
signal. Despite the superposition of individual scattering signals,
the MD can be observed clearly. Moreover, the MD perpendicular to
the substrate (MD⊥) couples with metal films for
s-pol illumination. In Figure 2b, the resonance wavelength of MD⊥ appears
at 540 nm with sharper bandwidths.

scattering cross-section for a single
silicon spherical nanoparticle on different substrates: free space
(black), glass (blue), PEC (green), 40 nm silver film (orange), and
40 nm gold film (red). (a) Scattering cross-section spectra for p-pol
incident light. (b) Scattering cross-section spectra for s-pol incident
light. The radius of the nanoparticle is 65 nm in all cases, with
the incident angle being 70°. Dashed lines indicate the ED perpendicular
to the substrate (ED⊥).

To verify whether silicon
nanoparticles could induce stronger scattering cross-sections of ED⊥ on a substrate with high reflectivity than on dielectric
substrates, we particularly studied the cases of silver and gold thin
films. For the case of a silicon nanoparticle on a silver thin film,
the resonance of ED⊥ shifts to ∼640 nm and
generates broad scattering spectra. On comparing the spectra of silicon
nanoparticles on silver and gold, we noted that ED⊥ on the gold thin film appears at a longer wavelength (Figure 2a) because the plasma frequency
of gold is smaller than that of silver. The result shows that ED⊥ arises due to the strong interaction between the Si
nanoparticles and the metal films. Moreover, except for ED⊥, the other resonance peaks do not shift when the metallic thin films
are changed. The resonance of ED⊥ is affected not
only by the polarization of incident light but also by the substrate
material.

Results and Discussion
As shown in Figure 3, three resonant wavelengths are observed clearly under both p-pol
and s-pol illuminations for the case of a silicon nanoparticle on
a gold thin film. In Figure 3a,d, the direction of the ED is aligned with the incident
electric field, and the resonance wavelength is 470 nm. Similarly,
the MD (560 nm) parallel to the incident magnetic field affords a
ring-shaped distribution of the normalized electric field in the silicon
nanoparticle. Importantly, on comparing the distributions of the electric
fields at 700 nm between p-pol and s-pol, we noted the evidently distinct
intensity difference at the interface between the silicon nanoparticle
and the gold thin film. In Figure 3c, the electric fields perpendicular to the substrate
correspond to ED⊥, and the electric field is strongly
localized in the lower hemisphere of the nanoparticle.

Figure 3 Near-field distributions
of normalized electric field
at the resonance wavelengths of three analyzed modes. The tangent
plane passing through the center of the nanoparticle is parallel to
the plane of the incident electric field. The left column (a)–(c)
shows the results for p-polarization, and the right column (d)–(f)
shows the results for s-polarization. The arrows indicate the direction
of the electric field in (c). The inset in (e) illustrates the MD
in the x–y plane. The minimum
and maximum values of the color bar are listed in each panel, and
the intensity of the incident electric field is 28 500 (V/m).

Table 1 lists the intensity
of the electric field at the gap between the silicon nanoparticle
and the gold thin film for each resonance for both p-pol and s-pol
illuminations. The intensity of the localized electric field is dependent
on the dipole modes, reflectivity of the gold thin film, and polarization.
As shown in Figure 3b, the localized electric field is enhanced in the gap. Because the
MD parallel to the substrate induces an MD in the gold thin film in
the same direction, an inverse MD is simultaneously induced in the
interface. The induced MD generates a ring-shaped electric field and
increases the intensity of the electric field in the gap. In contrast,
the near-field of the normalized electric field at 700 nm is strongest
for p-pol illumination because of the influence of the direction of
the ED. In addition, because of the small distance between the Si
nanoparticle and the gold film (Figure 3c), there is strong ED⊥ coupling
with the gold film. However, there is no localized electric field
enhancement for the case of the Si nanoparticle under s-pol illumination
(Figure 3f).

Next, in the experimental phase of our study, we deposited a 70 nm
thick gold film on indium tin oxide glass by means of electron beam
evaporation. Silicon nanoparticles (Nanostructured & Amorphous
Materials, Inc.) were mixed in deionized water and spin-coated onto
the gold films. The scattering signal was acquired with the use of
a customized microscope (modified Olympus BX51) equipped with confocal
apertures, a monochromator (Andor SR303i), and an EMCCD (Andor iXon
888).16 The scattering spectra of nanoparticles
were excited by white light from a 150 W xenon lamp and collected
by the objective lens. Spectrum normalization was performed as per
the following expression  Here, SNP-film represents the scattering signal obtained from the area containing
only one nanoparticle, and Sfilm represents
the background signal obtained from the area without the nanoparticle
on the same sample. Further, Sstd represents
the reference spectrum of the light source as obtained from the surface
of a reflectance standard. In the measurements, the excitation light
was partially covered to generate the uni-azimuthal angle (∼5°)
excitation condition because the internal illumination built into
the microscope when used under dark-field illumination was ring-shaped.
A single Si nanoparticle placed on a gold film was illuminated at
oblique angles (64°–74°) with respect to the normal direction
of the substrate surface. A polarizer was placed in front of the excitation
ring to vary the incident polarization between p- and s-pol. The scattering
signal was collected by a high-numerical-aperture objective (Olympus
MPLFLN 100× BDP, NA = 0.9, WD = 1 mm). 

To
verify the presence of coupling between the ED⊥ of
the silicon nanoparticle and the gold thin film, we measured the scattering
spectra for three different nanoparticle diameters (120, 150, and
195 nm), as shown in Figure 4. The resonance wavelengths exhibit a red shift with increasing
particle diameter, which can be convenient for tuning the enhancement
of the localized electric field at the desired wavelength. Importantly,
the scattering spectra of the simulations and experiments exhibit
a close agreement.

thin film under p-pol and s-pol illumination. The top row shows the
simulation results, and the bottom row shows the experimental results.
The particle sizes are 120 nm (a, b), 150 nm (c, d), and 195 nm (e,
f).

The dark-field color images were utilized
to verify the presence of the polarization-dependent scattering signals.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of the 150 nm diameter
Si nanoparticle is shown in Figure 5a. When the silicon nanoparticle is excited with p-pol
light, it appears orange-colored due to the enhancement of the scattering
contributed by ED⊥ (Figure 5b). In contrast, the dark-field microscopy
image for s-pol illumination appears yellowish because the scattering
signal is primarily due to MD⊥ at shorter wavelengths
(Figure 5c). Figure 5d,e shows the dark-field
images of the Si nanoparticle excited with a 675 nm laser at an incident
angle of 70°. The scattering images were collected by a long-focal-length
objective (Olympus LMPLFLN 100× BD, NA = 0.8, WD = 3.3 mm) and a digital camera (Canon EOS 750D). The
intensity of scattering at 675 nm for p-pol is stronger than that
for s-pol.

The scattering cross-section spectra of the Si nanoparticle
(r = 75 nm) on gold thin film (70 nm thickness) at
different incidence angles are shown in Figure 6a,b for different polarizations. At small
incident angles (0°–20°), there are two resonance peaks
corresponding to the in-plane ED (ED∥) at 540 nm
(Figure 7a) and the
in-plane MD (MD∥) at 630 nm (Figure 7b), and the scattering spectra are similar
for both polarizations. When the incident angle is greater than 20°,
MD⊥ at 600 nm becomes significantly stronger for
s-pol. Furthermore, MD⊥ produces a sharper scattering
signal than that of the in-plane MD. For the p-pol case, when the
incident angle is greater than 45°, ED⊥, which
generates a considerably broad scattering signal, is enhanced at 730
nm (Figure 7c). For
both polarizations with incident angles greater than 75°, all
resonances become fairly weak owing to decreasing total incident electric
and magnetic fields (when the incidence angle approaches 90°,
the reflection coefficients approach −1 for both polarizations,
and, therefore, the total external electric and magnetic fields approach
zero).37

illumination. Arrows indicate the main resonant contributions of the

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated
a strong enhancement of the electric near-field under oblique p-pol
illumination through coupling of the ED⊥ of high-refractive-index
silicon nanoparticles with gold thin films. The hybrid silicon nanoparticles
coupled with gold thin film exhibited extraordinary field enhancement
(∼1250-fold enhancement). In addition, the ED⊥ resonances were dependent on the type of metal films. The experiments
and simulations of the scattering spectra, far-field images, and electric
near-field distributions showed a close agreement. The near-field
enhancement of silicon nanoparticles on a gold-film system under oblique
illumination can be applied to other surface-enhanced spectroscopic
techniques such as infrared spectroscopies, surface-enhanced fluorescence,
and even silicon-tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy.
