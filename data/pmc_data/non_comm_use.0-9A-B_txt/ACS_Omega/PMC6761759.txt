The integral equation formalism polarizable continuum
model (IEF-PCM) for solvent effects with the default solvent (water)
and solvent parameters, together with the density functional theory
method at 6-31G(d) level, was used to optimize molecular structures
for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. Four molecular descriptors
were selected to develop quantitative structure–activity relationship
(QSAR) models for the depuration rate constants (kd) of 63 PCB congeners in a juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The optimal multiple linear
regression (MLR) model has the correlation coefficient R of 0.933 and the root mean square (rms) error of 0.0681 for the
total set of 63 PCB congeners. The support vector regression model
has R of 0.953 and rms error of 0.0576 for the total
set. Both the MLR and SVM QSAR models in this paper were accurate
and acceptable compared with other QSAR models for the depuration
rate of PCB congeners reported in references. Thus, applying IEF-PCM
and B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations for molecular descriptor derivation
of PCB congeners is successful.

Introduction
Development of predictive quantitative
structure–activity
relationship (QSAR) models has been the concern of chemists, pharmacists,
and environmental scientists. QSARs play a significant role in evaluating
the biological activity, toxicity, and physicochemical property of
chemicals that may not be synthetized.1,2 One of the main
aims of QSAR studies is to develop a mathematical correlation between
the activity of interest and molecular descriptors, which reflect
the quantitative molecular structure information. A successful QSAR
enables the exploration of the chemical reaction mechanism or biochemical
process.3,4

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are
serious environmental pollutants, which have the characteristics of
environmental persistence, bioaccumulation and long-distance global
migration.5 These characteristics are closely
related to their physical and chemical properties. Animal experiments
have shown that PCBs can induce lesions of skin, liver, gastrointestinal
system, nervous system, reproductive system, and immune system and
even lead to carcinomas. With the increasing attention to environmental
and health issues, PCBs have become the research focus in the field
of environmental science and toxicology. There are 209 PCB congeners
that possess similar molecular structures. It is unrealistic to determine
the physical and chemical properties or biological activities of each
PCB because of the costs involved. The QSAR can help to predict the
physical and chemical properties or activities of PCBs.

Some
researchers have carried out the QSAR studies of bioconcentration
factors,6 octanol/water partition coefficients,7 and health effects8 for PCBs. Niu et al. developed a 5-descriptor QSAR model for the
photodegradation half-life (t1/2) of 22
PCBs in the n-hexane solution under UV irradiation.9 The ratio (4.4 = 22/5) of the samples (22) to
descriptors (5) used is too small and lower than the minimum value
of 5.

The research group of Liu developed 2 QSAR models for
the depuration rates (the logarithm of the depuration rate constants,
log kd) of 34 PCBs. One model was
based on 5 descriptors and 26 PCBs in the training set.10 The other was obtained from the training set
of 24 PCBs with 8 descriptors.11 Both the
models were validated with the respective test sets. Although the
sample set (34 PCBs) is relatively small compared with the descriptors
used in the models, their correlation coefficients R (0.941 and 0.954, respectively) are high.10,11

Liu et al. further used 6 quantum chemical descriptors to build a
QSAR model for the depuration rate constants (log kd) of 62 PCBs measured at 285 K in juvenile rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss). The correlation
coefficient R and standard deviation are 0.853 and
0.05, respectively. The statistical results of the models are acceptable.
In addition, the descriptors used have definite physical meanings.12

Fatemi and Chahi developed QSAR models
for the half-lives (log t1/2) for
62 PCBs measured at 281 K in juvenile rainbow trout. The models were
based on four descriptors and statistical methods including linear
and nonlinear regression techniques. The coefficients of determination R2 from the training set including 43 PCBs are
0.855–0.921. These models are accurate and acceptable.13

Descriptor calculation is a key step toward
developing QSAR models. All these QSAR models stated above are based
on the descriptors obtained from a single molecule in vacuum and gas
phase.6−13 Due
to the solvent effect, the geometrical structure, frontier orbital
energy, and charge distribution of solute molecules in gas and solution
may be different, which affect the dissolution and chemical reactions
of solutions.14 In this paper, the integral
equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) was adopted
to model the solvent effects in molecular geometry optimization. After
that, Dragon 6.015 was used to calculate
the molecular descriptors. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and support
vector machine (SVM) algorithm were used to develop the QSAR models
of depuration rate constants for PCB congeners.16

Results and Discussion
Correlation analysis between the depuration rate constants (kd) of 42 PCB congeners in the training set (see Table 1) and 284 descriptors
calculated with Dragon 6.015 was carried
out with the MLR analysis in IBM SPSS Statistical 19. An optimal descriptor
subset was obtained, which included four molecular descriptors: LOC, SpMax3_Bh(m), SpMin8_Bh(p), and SpMin5_Bh(s). The MLR equation is as follows 1  where N is
the number of PCB congeners, R is the correlation
coefficient, rms is the root mean square error, and F is the Fischer ratio. Descriptor characteristics and definitions
are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. The MLR model was used
to predict the depuration rate constants kd of 21 PCB congeners in the test set. The correlation coefficient R and rms error are 0.922 and 0.0631, respectively. The
total set of 63 PCB congeners has R of 0.933 and
rms error of 0.0681.

An analysis of the depuration rate constants
with respect to 285 descriptors (including the average quadrupole
moment (Aqm) converted to exp(0.08Aqm)) resulted in the following
regression 2  Similarly, eq 2 was
used for the prediction of
the test set. The rms errors for the training set, test set, and total
set are 0.0681, 0.0703, and 0.0688, respectively. The prediction rms
errors from eq 2 are
slightly higher than those of eq 1. Therefore, eq 1 was taken as the optimal MLR model in this paper.

The four
molecular descriptors, LOC, SpMax3_Bh(m), SpMin8_Bh(p), and SpMin5_Bh(s), were used as
input variables to develop SVM models for the depuration rate constants
(kd) for 63 PCB congeners (see Table 1) by applying LibSVM
package17 on the platform of MATLAB R2014a.
The regularization constant C and the Gaussian function
parameter γ were tuned with the particle swarm optimization
(PSO) algorithm under the following experimental conditions: the cognition
learning factor c1 (1.5); the social learning
factor c2 (1.7); the number of particles N1 (20); the maximum number of iterations N2 (200); the searching ranges of both parameters C and γ being [1, 100]; the N of
the N-fold-cross-validation being 5; and ε
is the ε-insensitive loss function with a default value of 0.001.

The optimization results from the training set show that the optimal
SVM model based on four molecular descriptors in the MLR model possesses
parameters C of 10.874 and γ of 28.010. The
correlation coefficient R and rms error from the
training set are 0.957 and 0.0579, respectively. Subsequently, 21
PCB congeners in the test set were used to evaluate the SVM model.
The correlation coefficient R and rms error from
the test set are 0.940 and 0.0572, respectively. The R and rms error from the total set are 0.953 and 0.0576, respectively.
Obviously, the results from the SVM model are more accurate than that
from the MLR model (eq 1). Compared with the model12 (R = 0.853) that deals with depuration rate constants (kd) at 285 K for 62 PCB congeners, both the MLR
(R = 0.937) and the SVM model (R = 0.957) in this paper show acceptable statistical results.

As can be seen from Table 2, the four descriptors (LOC, SpMax3_Bh(m), SpMin8_Bh(p), and SpMin5_Bh(s)) have a sig.-value
(or P-value) less than 0.05, which suggest that all
the descriptors are significant and related to depuration rate constants
of PCBs. In addition, these descriptors possess a variance inflation
factor (VIF) of less than 10, which are acceptable, since the correlation
coefficients (Rj2) between
any two descriptors are less than 0.9 according to the definition
of VIF = 1/(1 – Rj2).
Thus, the four descriptors are weakly correlated with each other.

The t-test can be used to evaluate the significance
of descriptors in MLR equations. A descriptor with a larger absolute
value of t-test is a more significant descriptor
and makes more contribution to the dependent variable. According to
the t-test in Table 2, the most significant descriptor appearing in eq 1 is LOC, which is a lopping
centric index. It is derived from a molecular graph with H-depletion
and obtained by graph pruning, which is a process of gradually removing
all terminal vertices.15 This descriptor
can reflect the degree of molecular branching: the higher the value
of LOC, the more branched the graph is. For PCB congeners with similar
structures, the PCB compound with more chlorine atoms tends to be
inert to degradation and decreases the depuration rate constants (kd). Thus, LOC is negatively
correlated with kd.

The three molecular
descriptors, SpMax3_Bh(m), SpMin8_Bh(p), and SpMin5_Bh(s), belong to Burden eigenvalues. They were
calculated from molecular diagrams containing hydrogen atoms by means
of the Burden matrix, Bh(w). This matrix in nature
is a modified adjacency matrix and calculated by the following rules:
the diagonal elements are atomic properties scaled by carbon atoms;
the off-diagonal elements describing the characteristics pairs of
bonded atoms are equal to the square root of the conventional bond
order; the elements in the matrix that reflects terminal bonds are
augmented by 0.1; all other entries are set to 0.001. For each matrix
in the Dragon calculation, there are first eight largest positive
eigenvalues SpMaxk_Bh(w) and first eight smallest
negative eigenvalues SpMink_Bh(w) (absolute values).
Here, k is the eigenvalue rank and w is the atomic property such as atomic mass (m),
atom polarizability (p), and intrinsic state (s). These molecular descriptors can be used to solve the
problem of searching for molecular structural similarity (or diversity).15

Figure 1 shows the relationship between standardized residuals
(SR) and leverages and can be used to visualize the applicability
domain of the SVM model.14,18 Predictions only for
the samples that fall into this domain are considered reliable. As
can been seen from Figure 1, there are three PCBs (no. 42, 2,3′-dichlorobiphenyl;
no. 37, 2,2′,3,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; and no. 40, 2,2′,6-trichlorobiphenyl)
in the training set that possess leverage values greater than the
warning leverage h* (=0.2857). But their SR values
are close to zero. Thus, the three PCBs can stabilize the SVM model
and make it more accurate. In addition, there is only one PCB (no.
62, 2,2′,5-trichlorobiphenyl) having h > h* and SR < 3 in the test set, which indicates that the
SVM model has good generalizability.

Figure 1 Plot of standardized residuals versus leverages.

The SVM model was further evaluated
with the statistical parameters (qint2, r2, k, k′, R02, R′02, and rm2).18−23 The value of the internal correlation coefficient qint2 obtained from the training set
with leave-one-out cross-validation procedure is 0.690 (>0.5);
the value of the correlation coefficient r2 for the test set is 0.883 (>0.6); the slopes k and k′ of the regression lines through the
origin are 0.983 and 1.003, respectively, within the range of 0.85–1.15;
the values of the determination coefficients R02 (0.845) and R′02 (0.875) are close to those of r2 (0.883) with (r2 – R02)/r2 = 0.044 and (r2 – R′02)/r2 =
0.009, both less than 0.1; and the value of the correlation coefficient r02 (without an intercept for r2) is 0.878 and that of the rm2 = r2 ×
[1 – (r2 – r02)1/2] is 0.820 (>0.5). These
statistical parameters satisfy the criteria defined for an acceptable
QSPR model.19−21 Therefore,
the SVM model in this paper is successful.

Conclusions
Four molecular descriptors were successfully
used to develop the QSAR models for depuration rate constants (kd) of 63 PCB congeners in juvenile rainbow trout.
IEF-PCM and B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculation, with the default solvent (water)
and solvent parameters, was used for descriptor derivation. The branching
degree (LOC), molecular similarity indices based
on atomic mass (SpMax3_Bh(m)), atom
polarizability (SpMin8_Bh(p)), and
intrinsic state (SpMin5_Bh(s)) can
reflect the structure factors affecting the depuration rate constants
(kd) of PCBs. Both the MLR and SVM models
were tested to be accurate and acceptable with correlation coefficients
of 0.933 and 0.953, respectively. It is feasible to develop QSAR models
for depuration rate constants (kd) of
PCB congeners by applying IEF-PCM and B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations
for molecular descriptor derivation. This result encourages the further
application of QSAR to other properties, such as photodegradation
half-life and biological activities of PCBs.

Materials and Methods
Experimental
Data
The experimental values of depuration rate constants
(kd) for 63 PCB congeners in juvenile
rainbow trout (O. mykiss) were taken
from the literature16 and are listed in Table 1. Sixty-three PCB
congeners were randomly split into a training set (42 PCBs) and a
test set (21 PCBs). The former was used to train QSAR models, and
the latter was used to validate the models. In the experiment,16 these fishes were exposed to a high-dose treatment
of PCBs and the kd values measured at
281 K ranged from 0.3 to 1.3. Because the PCB congeners possess similar
molecular structures, the range of the kd values is relatively narrow. This phenomenon can be found in other
properties.12,13 Therefore, the QSAR models based
on PCBs can only be used for the prediction of the properties of PCBs.

Structural Descriptor Calculations
The molecular structures of PCB congeners were sketched by ChemBioDraw
Ultra 11.0 and preliminarily optimized by ChemBio3D Ultra 11.0 in
ChemOffice 2008 with molecular mechanics (MM2) method with the default
convergence criterion. The energy-minimized molecules were further
optimized by applying IEF-PCM/B3LYP/6-31G(d) in Gaussian 09 program,
with the default solvent (water) and solvent parameters. There are
two reasons for carrying out the IEF-PCM and B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations
for the molecular descriptor derivation of PCB congeners. One is that
this approach can be used to optimize the molecular structures of
solute at a reasonable level, which has been investigated by our previous
work.14 The other is the fact that this
approach can provide more structural information and molecular descriptors
than other semiempirical quantum chemical calculations such as the
AM1 and PM6. For example, IEF-PCM and B3LYP/6-31G(d) can be used for
the calculation of the average quadrupole moment (Aqm), although these
descriptors may not be present in models.

Besides the average
quadrupole moment, Dragon 6.0 was used for the molecular descriptor
derivation after full geometry optimization. Redundant and nonuseful
structure descriptors that are equal to a constant or have a pair
of correlation coefficients ≥0.90 were deleted from the 4885
descriptors calculated. In total, 284 descriptors were obtained with
Dragon 6.0.15

SVM Principle
The SVM algorithm has many attractive
characteristics and advantages. Unlike the traditional theory, the
SVM adopts the principle of structural risk minimization, which makes
it possible for the SVM to have a good prediction ability even with
fewer training samples. The SVM was originally used in pattern recognition.
With the introduction of insensitive loss function, the application
of SVM extends to the prediction of properties in nonlinear regression
models and the evaluation in a time-series analysis.

The main
idea of the SVM used in the regression prediction is to map the input
characteristic parameters into a high-dimensional feature space through
a nonlinear mapping function and then carry out a linear regression
analysis. The SVM algorithm is based on the following regression2,4,24 3  where n is the number of samples used in the training
set, φ(x) is the mapping function, x is the input vector composed of characteristic parameters
reflecting molecular structure, and f(x) is the output of prediction results. The coefficients w and b can be estimated by means of the following
minimization 4  subject to 5   6  where C is a
penalty parameter used for adjusting the training error. ε is
a prescribed parameter of the ε-insensitive loss function. ξ
and ξ* are the slack variables. In general, support vector regression
is based on the ε-insensitive loss function to minimize the
training error 7  Thus, eq 3 becomes 8  where αi and αi* are
the Lagrange multipliers that are used to solve the quadratic optimization
problem. Equation 9 can
be obtained when the kernel function k(x, y) is introduced 9  where s is equal to the number of samples whose αi and αi* values are above
0. In the present work, the following Gaussian radial basis function
was used 10  The kernel width γ
affects the prediction performance of the SVM models. In this paper,
the SVM parameters C and γ are tuned with the
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.25−28
