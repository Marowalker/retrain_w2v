Mesoporous
magnesium carbonate (MMC) was first presented in 2013,
and this material is currently under consideration for use in a number
of biotechnological applications including topical formulations. This
study presents the first evaluation of the antibacterial properties
of the material with mesoporous silica and two other magnesium-containing
powder materials used as references. All powder materials in this
study are sieved to achieve a particle size distribution between 25
and 75 μm. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus
epidermidis is used as the model bacterium due to
its prevalence on human skin, its likelihood of developing resistance
to antibiotics, for example, from routine exposure to antibiotics
secreted in sweat, and because it is found inside affected acne vulgaris
pores. Quantification of bacterial viability using a metabolic activity
assay with resazurin as the fluorescent indicator shows that MMC exerts
a strong antibacterial effect on the bacteria and that alkalinity
accounts for the major part of this effect. The results open up for
further development of MMC in on-skin applications where bacterial
growth inhibition without using antibiotics is deemed favorable.

Introduction
About twice in a century,
basic advances in science and technology bring about a total change
in society, industry, and our everyday life. We are now beginning
to approach the phase in which only incremental developments are to
be expected from our latest major advance, the development of computers
that has created a revolution in information and communication technology.
Right now many indicators point toward the fact that advanced materials
technology or nanotechnology will be the driver of the next science
and technology revolution,1−3 and the reason is that such technology
has given us tools to decide which properties we want to give our
materials. We are no longer at the mercy of the properties nature
has given our materials but can instead start to precisely tailor
them.

To exemplify, we have started to develop nanomaterial-based
solar
cells with the potential of outperforming those currently on the market
by several hundred percent in efficiency, depending on significantly
smaller amounts of material than in current solar cells,4 nanostructured batteries based on sustainable
materials such as cellulose and conducting polymers5,6 or
organic radical polymers,7 targeted nanotechnology-based
cancer treatments based on passive and active targeting of tumor cells,8 and a number of other medicine inventions.9 In spite of the great opportunity of nanotechnology
within both energy technology and medicine, the cosmetics industry
was among the first to implement nanotechnological principles in product
development.10 When it comes to skin care
products based on nanotechnological principles, the borderline between
cosmetics and medicine is thin. New nanostructures allow for delivery
of both active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as purely cosmetic
agents to different layers of the skin (topical) as well as through
the skin (transdermal) to cause systemic effects.

Mesoporous
nanomaterials constitute a very promising class of materials
in such areas of use due to their tunable pore structure that can
be adjusted to the ingredients to be loaded into, and subsequently
released from, them. For example, such materials are presently evaluated
for haircare,10 dermal delivery of pharmaceutical
compounds such as small interfering RNA to treat fibrosis,11 and as delivery vehicles for peptides12 and vitamins in cosmetic formulations.13 The most frequently studied type of mesoporous
material for such applications is mesoporous silica, whose synthesis
typically relies on the use of organic template molecules14,15 and relatively high calcination temperatures to create the desired
pore structure.

In 2013, we presented the template-free synthesis
of a mesoporous
magnesium carbonate (MMC) material, commercialized as Upsalite,16 that is synthesized in a low-temperature process
and has a well-defined pore size distribution.17 In addition to its ability to absorb a large amount of
moisture,16,18,19 this material
has recently been found to be able to stabilize poorly soluble drugs
incorporated into the mesopore structure of the material, thus enhancing
their dissolution rate.20,21 The material, which
consists of amorphous magnesium carbonate and a small portion of crystalline
magnesium oxide, has further been indicated to be safe to use on skin
as it, even at very high concentrations, was shown to be nontoxic
for human dermal fibroblast cells and to not induce cutaneous reactions
in in vivo skin irritation tests. In addition, no evidence of systemic
toxicity was found when saline extracts of the material were injected
in mice.22

The above findings spur
us to further investigate biomedical, and
in particular on-skin, application areas of use for MMC. In this work,
we present the first analysis of the antibacterial properties of this
material and compare them with those of mesoporous silica and two
other magnesium-containing powder materials to elucidate the mechanism
of the observed properties. The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis is used as a model in
this study due to its prevalence on human skin and also due to its
likelihood of developing resistance to antibiotics, for example, from
routine exposure to antibiotics secreted in sweat.23 In addition, the bacterium is found inside affected acne
vulgaris pores.24

Results
Characterization
of Sample Particles
Figure 1 displays scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images of a sieved particle from each of the four
materials included in this study. Particles of MMC were generally
single pieces of material corresponding in size to the sieved interval
25–75 μm, whereas particles of the three other materials
consist of aggregates of much smaller primary particles.

SBA-15, and (d) magnesium carbonate basic.

Antibacterial Test
The antibacterial effect of MMC
in comparison to magnesium oxide, mesoporous silica, and magnesium
carbonate basic was assessed with the help of the metabolic activity
assay (MAA) containing the metabolic indicator resazurin. The fluorescence
of the assay containing the samples and bacteria provides a measure
of the viability of the bacteria when corrected for the background
fluorescence of the samples without bacteria. Figure 2 displays the fluorescence signals and thus
the viability of the bacteria in contact with the four powder samples,
as well as the viability of the negative control containing phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) without any powder. The PBS measurement was taken from
the well with the highest bacterial concentration in the standard
curve, which was identical to the bacteria concentration used with
all powder samples. Measurements of the standard curve (not displayed)
showed good linearity between fluorescence levels and bacteria concentrations
at all measurement times.

Figure 2 Viability measurements as a function of time
for bacteria in contact
with MMC, magnesium oxide, mesoporous silica, and magnesium carbonate
basic in comparison to the negative control PBS. Solid lines are guides
to the eye, whereas the dashed line represents an exponential fit
to the data for PBS. Data represent mean ± 1 sd for n = 3.

The viability measurements of
bacteria in PBS indicate a relatively
uninhibited growth, as can be seen by the exponential increase in
fluorescence measurements. An exponential fit to the data provides
a generation or doubling time of the bacteria of ln(2)/0.897 h ≈
46 min. Both MMC and MgO indicate a strong antibacterial effect against S. epidermidis. Magnesium carbonate basic also shows
a strong effect, albeit not to the same degree as MMC and MgO. Mesoporous
silica does not show any effect for the first hour compared to PBS,
but subsequent measurements show an effect that reduced the bacterial
growth/viability compared to PBS. After 3 h, the viability reductions
compared to PBS were 71, 96, 100, and 100% for SBA-15, magnesium carbonate
basic, MgO, and MMC, respectively.

Recovery Test
Results from the antibacterial test shown
above indicate a strong antibacterial effect and/or growth inhibition
for three of the materials tested. To determine whether the bacteria
were completely inactivated, a recovery test was carried out where
the bacteria were first separated from the powder suspension and MAA
solution, and then reintroduced into a fresh MAA without sample particles. Figure 3 shows the growth
curves of the bacteria that were previously subjected to the antibacterial
test. All samples show some degree of viability, indicating that the
bacteria were not completely killed during the antibacterial test,
despite the fact that the viability reduction was nearly complete
for MgO and MMC (see Figure 2). Generally, the rate of growth, indicated by the increasing
levels of fluorescence in Figure 3, appears to correspond to the degree of viability
reduction observed in the antibacterial test. The fluorescence levels
are the lowest for MgO, suggesting that the antibacterial effect of
MgO was the strongest. Although the viability of the bacteria in contact
with MMC was at least as low as that for MgO in the previous test,
the bacteria appear to have recovered to a greater extent when removed
from contact with MMC. This suggests that although MMC completely
inhibited the growth of S. epidermidis, it did not completely kill the bacteria.

Figure 3 Fluorescence measurements
showing the growth of bacteria suspensions
after separation from the powder samples at the end of the antibacterial
test. The legend indicates which sample powder the bacteria had previously
been in contact with. Lines represent exponential fits to the data,
with corresponding equations provided in the top left corner of the
plot.

Exponential curves are fitted
to the data in Figure 3, and the corresponding equations can also
be found in the plot. It is interesting to note that the generation
time of the bacteria previously in contact with the SBA-15 powder
was shorter than the generation time of bacteria that had not been
in contact with any powder in the previous antibacterial test (28
min versus 46 min; see the PBS sample in Figure 2). This could likely be explained by the
higher concentration of the Mueller–Hinton (MH) broth that
was used in the MAA for the recovery test that consequently led to
a higher growth rate.

Effect of Media pH
To investigate
the effect of pH
on the viability of S. epidermidis,
the pH of the MAA media was adjusted between 7.4 and 10.5 by the addition
of NaOH, and the fluorescence was measured after 30 min. Figure 4 displays the results
of the test where the relative viabilities of the bacterial suspensions
are shown relative to the unadjusted MAA media at pH = 7.4. It can
be seen that a more alkaline environment reduces the viability of S. epidermidis or at least suppresses the growth;
90% viability/growth reduction is achieved with a pH of 9.11, whereas
complete inhibition is observed at pH = 10.54.

Figure 4 Relative viability of
bacterial suspensions at pH ranging from
7.4 to 10.54, referenced to the viability of the unadjusted media
at pH = 7.4. Data represent mean ± 1 sd for n = 3.

Controlling for Effects
of Media pH and Particles
An
additional antibacterial test was performed with MMC, SBA-15, and
MgO with the aim to separate antibacterial effects due to contact
with the particles themselves from the effects due to possible substances
leached from the materials. The test was performed in a MAA with sufficient
buffer capacity to maintain the pH despite the presence of the basic
materials being tested. This buffer capacity was verified by measuring
the pH of the MAA solution containing the different sample powders
over 4 h, which proved to be 7.25 ± 0.02, 7.10 ± 0.02, and
7.34 ± 0.02 for MMC, SBA-15, and MgO, respectively. This contrasts
with the pH of the MAA solution containing the powders in the first
antibacterial test, where the pH was found to be 8.39, 7.32, and 9.76
for MMC, SBA-15, and MgO, respectively.

Figure 5 displays the fluorescence signals, corresponding
to the viability, of the bacteria in contact with the three powder
samples, as well as that of the negative control containing PBS without
any powder. As in the first antibacterial test detailed above, the
PBS measurement corresponded to the well with the highest bacterial
concentration in the standard curve, which was identical to the bacteria
concentration used with all powder samples. Measurements of the standard
curve (not displayed) showed good linearity between fluorescence levels
and bacteria concentrations at all measurement times. Fluorescence
signals were concurrently recorded on the bacteria suspensions placed
in the filtered solutions in which the powder samples had previously
been soaked. Differences between these fluorescence levels and the
corresponding fluorescence levels from particle-containing wells were
not statistically significant (unpaired Student t-test, p > 0.05), and thus, only the fluorescence
measurements from the bacterial suspensions in contact with the sample
particles are displayed.

Figure 5 Viability measurements as a function of time
for bacteria in contact
with MMC, magnesium oxide, and mesoporous silica in concentrated PBS
(phosphate concentration 0.3 M). A negative control without powder
(denoted PBS) is provided for comparison. Solid lines are provided
as guides to the eye. Data represent mean ± 1 sd for n = 3.

The growth behavior of
bacteria in only PBS is markedly different
from that shown in Figure 2 for only PBS. In Figure 5, the growth rate of bacteria in PBS decreases as the
test proceeds instead of following the exponential profile observed
in Figure 2. This can
be attributed to the high ion concentration of concentrated PBS, making
the medium hypertonic relative to the bacterial cells and leading
to loss of water from the bacterial cells due to osmosis. On examining
the fluorescence of the bacteria suspensions in contact with particles,
there appears to be an initial viability reduction relative to the
PBS sample after 15 min (61, 63, and 40% for MMC, MgO, and SBA-15,
respectively), but after continued contact with the particles, the
viability increases relative to the viability of bacteria in PBS.
After approximately 2 h, the viability of the bacteria subjected to
SBA-15 match and follow that of bacteria in PBS, whereas the viability
of both MMC and MgO continues to grow linearly and exceeds the viability
of bacteria in PBS by as much as 47% (for the bacteria in contact
with MMC particles after 4 h).

Discussion
In
this study, MMC was investigated for antibacterial activity
against S. epidermidis. Information
about the bactericidal properties of this material is important for
the development of applications, such as topical formulations. Equally
important is obtaining information on the biocompatibility of this
mesoporous material. Recently, MMC was subjected to a toxicological
evaluation through in vitro cytotoxicity, skin irritation, and acute
systemic toxicity in vivo tests.22 These
tests showed that the material was nontoxic for human dermal fibroblasts
cells up to a concentration of 1 mg/mL after 48 h exposure and that
topical application of MMC resulted in negligible cutaneous reactions.

It is clear from the antibacterial test (cf. Figure 2) that MMC exhibits strong antibacterial
activity against S. epidermidis at
a concentration of 1 mg/mL, resulting in essentially no bacterial
viability during the entire three-hour test. Three possible mechanisms
have been proposed for the antibacterial activity of materials similar
to those used in this study, namely, direct interaction of particles
with bacteria,25−27 an alkaline effect,28,29 and the formation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS).30−37

Figure 4 proves
that S. epidermidis bacteria are sensitive
to an alkaline environment and therefore it is reasonable to expect
some degree of alkaline effect from MMC because the addition of 1
mg/mL powder raised the pH of the MAA media to 8.39. The increase
in pH with MMC is likely due to the residual MgO present in the material
as previously shown.17 However, from Figure 4 we would only expect
approximately 65% reduction in viability with a media pH of 8.39,
whereas Figure 2 shows
a 100% viability reduction (although the bacteria are not permanently
inactivated, as indicated by the recovery test shown in Figure 3). Therefore, the alkalinity
of the MAA solution cannot entirely explain the antibacterial activity
of MMC. With the MgO sample, which also resulted in a 100% viability
reduction, the alkalinity of the MAA media (pH = 9.76) can explain
a larger proportion of the antibacterial effect but still not all
of it because Figure 4 indicates that a pH greater than 10 is required for complete viability
reduction of S. epidermidis. A possible
explanation for this increased antibacterial activity could be the
increased pH of a thin layer of water surrounding the particles that
results in damage to the bacterial cell membrane when coming in contact
with the particles.28 The bacteria are
more likely to come into contact with the particles if they are electrostatically
attracted to each other. S. epidermidis, like most bacteria, carry a net negative surface charge under typical
physiological conditions38 and thus would
be attracted to positively charged substrates in the media. The isoelectric
point (IEP) for MgO is around 12,39 which
means that it carries a positive charge in media with a pH less than
12 and would attract the negatively charged S. epidermidis. Previously, the surface charge of MgO nanoparticles has been determined
to be positive, and thus attractive, to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria.27 A similar situation may exist
for MMC because it contains some residual MgO, although the IEP for
the crystalline form of magnesium carbonate, magnesite, is only 6.8.40 In the case of SBA-15 particles, another mechanism
must be responsible for the viability reduction because this material
did not alter the pH of the MAA media, and its IEP is around 3.6,41 meaning it would be negatively charged in the
media.

Interaction between bacteria and particles in direct
contact with
them is another mechanism of antibacterial activity. As discussed
above, particles can be electrostatically attracted to bacteria due
to their surface charge and the subsequent absorption can damage the
cell membrane,25−27 and perhaps the particles can even enter the interior
of the cells.25 Typically, this occurs
with nanoparticles where smaller particles show increased antibacterial
activity.25,26 In the current study, all samples were sieved
to a 25–75 μm particle (or aggregate) size distribution,
and therefore, such direct interaction between the particles and bacteria
was not expected to be as great as it would be if the particles or
aggregates were nanosized. However, for samples other than MMC, particles
consist of aggregates of much smaller primary particles, where at
least one dimension is on the order of 1 μm or less, as can
be observed in Figure 1. It is highly likely that the mechanical agitation during testing
caused some of these particles to break into smaller ones, which may
have led to an increased antibacterial effect for these materials.
The diameter of the S. epidermidis bacteria
used in this study is just under 1 μm42 and therefore it is possible that the smaller primary particles
of some sample materials may interact strongly with the bacteria,
or perhaps even enter into the bacteria, and cause an antibacterial
effect. This would not be the case for MMC in which the particles
are clearly not composed of smaller primary nanoparticles.

The
third possible mechanism to the antibacterial activity is the
generation of ROS, such as the superoxide ion (O2–). For example, several studies have shown that MgO particles generate
superoxide ions30−33 and that a larger surface area increases the effect. This may be
applicable in the case of MMC particles, which have a surface area
of 207 m2/g. It has also been shown that SBA-15 particles
at a concentration of 1 mg/mL generate superoxide ions that cause
cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.43 The
specific surface area of SBA-15 was previously measured to be 428
m2/g.22 Thus, it is likely that
generation of ROS is responsible for the antibacterial effect of SBA-15
observed in this study. Similarly, the high surface area of MMC particles,
which also contain some residual MgO, suggests that ROS provide a
significant contribution to the observed antibacterial effect.

Finally, we return to the results where attempts to control the
effects of media pH and particles were made. As described above, a
major contributor to the antibacterial activity is deemed to be the
increased alkalinity of the MAA media, at least in the case of MMC
and MgO particles. By increasing the buffer capacity of the MAA solution,
the pH for all samples was the same as the PBS reference, and thus,
the effect of alkalinity was removed. Figure 5 showed that no sample material had a viability
that was reduced compared to the PBS reference (in fact MMC and MgO
had increased viability levels after 3 h compared to the PBS reference).
However, as discussed above, alkalinity effects of the MAA media should
not have accounted for the entire antibacterial effect. As such, some
effect of the particles was also expected, but this was not observed
because there was no statistical difference between the results with
or without particles. A likely explanation for this lack of effect
seen with particles compared to without particles is the electrostatic
screening caused by the very high ion concentration of the phosphate
buffer (0.3 M). This screening would likely decrease the attraction
and thus interaction between particles and bacteria, and consequently
reduce effects due to direct contact, ROS generation, or local pH
increase close to the particle surface.

In summary, alkalinity
accounts for the major part of MMC’s
antibacterial activity toward S. epidermidis, although it cannot entirely explain the effect. Other contributions
to this antibacterial effect are likely due to the generation of ROS
such as O2–, direct contact with the
particles, and/or an increased pH in close proximity to the particles.
Future studies should be directed at elucidating the mechanisms behind
the antibacterial activity, as well as determining this activity against
other bacterial strains and microorganisms. For example, it is known
that oxides like MgO and ZnO are more effective against Gram-positive
than Gram-negative bacteria36 and that
the susceptibility to alkalinity and ROS varies with bacteria strain.

Methods
Sample
Preparation and Characterization
Synthesis of
MMC (Upsalite) was carried out as described previously,22 with the exception that the material was ground
in a mortar to reduce the particle size and thereafter sieved to obtain
a powder with a particle size distribution between 25 and 75 μm.
The material had a surface area of 207 m2/g, a pore volume
of 0.34 cm3/g, an average pore size of 5.3 nm, and a density
of 2.28 g/cm3. Details of the characterization can be found
elsewhere.22

Three other materials
were included in the study: mesoporous silica (SBA-15; ACS Material,
LLC); magnesium oxide (MgO, CAS no. 1309-48-4; Sigma-Aldrich); and
magnesium carbonate basic (CAS no. 39409-82-0; Sigma-Aldrich). All
powders were sieved to achieve a particle size distribution between
25 and 75 μm.

Before testing, all powder samples were
sterilized by heating to
180 °C for 3 h.44

Characterization
of particle size was performed with a scanning
electron microscope (Leo 1550 SEM; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), operating
at an acceleration voltage of 5 keV. Sieved powders were first sputter
coated with a thin layer of gold/palladium to minimize charging effects.

Bacterial Strain
The bacterial strain Staphylococcus
epidermidis (CCUG 18 000A) was used
for all experiments. MH Broth (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)
was used to inoculate S. epidermidis overnight at 37 °C, after which the bacteria were centrifuged
(1500g, 10 min, EBA 30 centrifuge; Hettich, Tuttlingen,
Germany), collected, and resuspended in 250 μL of sterilized
PBS (Product no P4417; Sigma-Aldrich). The concentration of bacteria
was adjusted to an optical density (OD600) of 0.6 (UV spectrophotometer,
UV-1800; Shimadzu), corresponding to approximately 6 × 108 CFU/mL.

MAA
Quantification of bacterial
viability was performed
using a MAA with resazurin as the fluorescent indicator. In the assay,
blue nonfluorescent resazurin is reduced to pink, fluorescent resorufin
by metabolic intermediates, resulting in fluorescence being a sensitive
indicator of viable bacteria.45

To
perform the MAA, wells in a 48-well plate were first filled with 200
μL of sterilized MH broth, 50 μL of resazurin solution
at a concentration of 100 μg/mL, and 150 μL of PBS containing
the sample to be tested. Immediately before viability testing, 100
μL of bacterial suspension in PBS at an OD of 0.06 was added
to the well and thoroughly mixed with a pipette tip. The well plate
was then placed in an orbital shaking incubator at 37 °C with
shaking set to 250 rpm to limit settling of the particle samples and
to increase bacteria–sample contact. At specific time points,
the well plate was removed from the incubator, and fluorescence measurements
were made in a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite M200), set to 530
nm excitation and 590 nm emission.

To check for linearity of
the fluorescence readings with known
concentrations of bacteria, three standard curves were recorded in
parallel with each experiment. The standard curve consisted of a dilution
series of nine wells containing 100 μL of bacterial suspension
from OD = 0.06 to 0.003, 200 μL of sterilized MH broth, 200
μL of sterilized PBS, and resazurin at a concentration of 10
μg/mL.

Antibacterial Test
Suspensions of
each powder to be
tested (MMC, MgO, magnesium carbonate basic, and SBA-15) at a concentration
of 1 mg/mL were used in the MAA for the antibacterial testing. Measurements
were made in triplicate. Additionally, three wells containing each
sample material, but without bacteria, were tested to determine the
background fluorescence level of the MAA solutions/suspensions. Bacterial
viability was determined as the difference in fluorescence levels
between the wells with and without bacteria. Fluorescence measurements
were made at 15, 30 min, and 1–3 h.

Recovery Test
To determine whether bacteria were permanently
inactivated during the antibacterial test, a subsequent recovery test
was performed where the bacteria were isolated from the sample powders
and media used in the antibacterial test. This was accomplished by
first allowing the powders to settle to the bottom of the wells for
5 min following the final fluorescence measurement after 3 h of bacteria–sample
contact. Then, 100 μL of bacterial suspension from the upper
half of each of the three sample wells was extracted and placed in
a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. The procedure was repeated for a second
1.5 mL centrifuge tube to which an additional 300 μL of ethanol
was added to ensure that the bacteria were killed. For each sample
material, both tubes were then centrifuged (1500g, 10 min, EBA 30 centrifuge; Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany), and the
supernatant was poured out. Bacteria were resuspended in MH broth
and resazurin (10 μg/mL) and another MAA was performed with
fluorescence measurements made at 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 h. The difference
in fluorescence levels between the bacteria with and without added
ethanol provided the viability of the bacteria after the antibacterial
test when separated from the powder suspensions.

Effect of Media
pH
The effect of pH on the growth of S. epidermidis was investigated by performing the
MAA with media prepared at pH from 7.4 to 10.5, adjusted by the addition
of NaOH. Six wells at each pH level were tested, three with bacteria
and three without. The difference in fluorescence signal after 30
min of incubation at 37 °C provided the measure of bacterial
viability.

Controlling for Effects of Media pH and Particles
An
additional antibacterial test was performed using a concentrated PBS,
with increased buffer capacity to maintain the pH at approximately
7.4 in the presence of the added powder samples. Additionally, to
separate antibacterial effects due to contact with the particles themselves
from the effects due to possible substances leached from the materials,
testing of the media in which the sample powders had previously been
soaked was carried out in parallel with testing of the media containing
particles. Specifically, 100 mg of sample powder was added to 30 mL
of 1.0 M PBS and placed in a tube rotator for 16 h. Subsequently,
half of the suspension was centrifuged (1500g, 10
min, EBA 30 centrifuge; Hettich, Tuttlingen, Germany) and the supernatant
was filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate membrane to
remove any remaining particles. Both filtered PBS and PBS containing
particle suspensions were tested using the MAA. When combined with
the other constituents of the MAA, the resulting phosphate concentration
was 0.3 M, and where applicable the particle concentration was 1 mg/mL.
Three samples of both groups (filtered or particle-containing) of
each material (MMC, MgO, or SBA-15) were tested with fluorescence
readings made at 15, 30 min, 1–4 h. As in the Antibacterial section described above, additional three wells
for both groups of each material, but without bacteria, were tested
to determine the background fluorescence level of the MAA solutions/suspensions.
Bacterial viability was determined as the difference in fluorescence
levels between the wells with and without bacteria. Finally, pH measurements
of the MAA solution containing the different sample powders were made
at 0, 2, 3, and 4 h to determine any changes in the media pH.
