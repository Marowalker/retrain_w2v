The occurrence of contaminants of
emerging concern (CECs) in water
is an environmental issue that must be addressed to avoid damage to
ecosystems and human health. Inspired by this current issue, in this
work, we fabricated nanocellulose (NC) particles grafted with the
block copolymer Jeffamine ED 600 (NC–Jeffamine) capable of
adsorbing acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) from aqueous
solution by electrostatic interactions. NC–Jeffamine composites
were prepared by carboxylation of the NC surface via 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
oxidation followed by the covalent attachment of Jeffamine using the N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt reaction. The reaction
was followed and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and conductometric
titration. The physical characterization was performed by thermogravimetric
analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, scanning
electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Z-potential analysis.
This material was used to study the adsorption profile of three CECs
in deionized water, namely, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and DEET.
The adsorption isotherms were obtained at pH 3, 7, and 9, where the
best adsorption results corresponded to pH 9 because of the uniform
dispersion of the adsorbate in solution. A computational study based
on the density functional theory determined that the possible interactions
of the CECs with the adsorbent material were related to hydrogen bonds
and/or van der Waals forces. The calculated binding energies were
used as a descriptor to characterize the optimum adsorption site of
CECs onto NC–Jeffamine.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Recent
investigations have focused on the study and removal of
contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) to meet the current quality
criteria of potable water.1 Pharmaceutical
compounds and personal care products represent the majority of these
contaminants, which once entered in water streams are difficult to
remove because of their low concentration (ng−μg/L).2 Moreover, water treatment plants lack cost-effective
strategies to address the analytical removal of these CECs.3 Indeed, the common water treatment methods such
as ultraviolet, chlorination, and ozonation are somewhat effective
in degrading most of these contaminants. Nonetheless, these processes
do not account as actual removal methods, and the byproducts that
are created can be even more toxic than the initial compounds.4 Presently, the adsorption of CECs with activated
carbon is a preferred method because of the high porosity surface
area of the material, which allows for an effective adsorption of
the contaminants.5 However, production
of activated carbon demands considerable amounts of energy. In addition,
activated carbon pores can easily undergo fouling, drastically reducing
its adsorption efficiency.6

These
drawbacks have motivated research in the development of environmentally
friendly adsorption materials from natural sources such as nanocellulose
(NC). NC is primarily obtained from naturally occurring cellulose
sources and are getting considerable attention because they are inexpensive,
biodegradable, and practically renewable, making them sustainable
and nontoxic materials for several applications.7 NC is produced by the acid treatment of cellulose to remove
the naturally occurring amorphous domains, thereby obtaining a crystal
structure with high amounts of primary hydroxyl groups on the surface.
This characteristic makes NC a competitive material for the adsorption
of contaminants via electrostatic interactions onto its surface.8 However, the hydrophobic nature of most of CECs
makes the electrostatic interactions of NC ineffective to remove this
type of contaminants. Therefore, it is appropriate to incorporate
new functionalities by chemical modification of the NC primary hydroxyl
groups to improve the adsorption capabilities toward CECs. Typically,
polymers are preferred for this type of modification because of the
versatility and variability of their structure.9 In terms of the removal of CECs from water, an environmentally
friendly and biodegradable polymer such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)
represents a feasible option.10 PEG is
a nontoxic polymer widely used as an excipient in pharmaceutical products
with high hydrophilicity that allows an easier metabolization of prescribed
drugs within the human body.11 The latter
characteristic makes PEG-based polymers an ideal alternative for the
removal of CECs because low water-soluble pharmaceuticals represent
a considerable percentage of CECs. Other researchers have explored
the chemical modification of cellulose with PEG-based polymers,12 but there are no relevant studies regarding
the use of PEG–NC to remove CECs from water.

To contribute
to this area of research, herein, we present the
synthesis of a PEG–modified NC composite. This composite is
generated by the formation of an amide bond between a polyether diamine,
with an approximate molecular weight of 600 g/mol (Jeffamine ED 600),
and the previously carboxylated surface of NC. Besides the synthesis
of the proposed adsorbent, extensive chemical and physical characterization
is presented. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, adsorption isotherms
for different contaminants are executed, and the results are confirmed
using computational modeling.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Cellulose nanocrystals
(NC) 11.8 wt % aqueous slurry was purchased from The Process Development
Center of the University of Maine. To oxidize the surface of NC, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
(TEMPO), sodium hypochlorite, and sodium bromide were employed. Surface
grafting of O,O′-bis(2-aminopropyl)
polypropylene glycol-block-polyethylene glycol-block-polypropylene glycol (Jeffamine ED 600, 600 MW, 30
mequiv NH2/g) onto NC was achieved using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
(EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (sulfo-NHS).
Analytical standards, acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide
(DEET), served as the CECs. All above reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, and the experiments were conducted using deionized
water (18.23 MΩ/cm).

2.2 Methods
2.2.1 TEMPO-Mediated Oxidation of NC
Carboxylation of the
NC surface via TEMPO-mediated oxidation is a
well-known method reported elsewhere.13 First, we suspended NC (1.02 g, 6.3 mmol anhydroglucose units, AGU),
NaBr (324 mg, 3.15 mmol), and TEMPO (29.5 mg, 0.19 mmol) in 50 mL
of deionized water under continuous magnetic stirring. The reaction
was initiated by adding 0.94 mL of 12 wt % NaOCl dropwise to the suspension
for a molar ratio of 0.3 NaOCl/AGU. pH was maintained at 10 using
0.5 M NaOH until no fluctuations were observed. At this point, 10
mL of methanol was added to halt the reaction, and pH was lowered
to 7 using 0.5 M HCl. The resulting suspension was dialyzed in a 3.5
kD membrane against deionized water at 4 °C for 48 h to eliminate
excess reagents.

2.2.2 Polymer Coupling onto
the NC Surface by
EDC/sulfo-NHS
The surface of carboxylated polysaccharides
can be easily modified with amine-terminated compounds via the formation
of peptide bonds mediated by an EDC/sulfo-NHS coupling reaction.14 EDC (110 mg, 5.77 mmol) and sulfo-NHS (121 mg,
5.57 mmol) were dissolved in a 100 mL suspension of dialyzed oxidized
NC. Amine-terminal Jeffamine ED 600 (184 mg, 5.52 mequiv of NH2) was added to the suspension with respect to the carboxylic
content of oxidized NC (determined by conductometric titration), pH
was set to 8, and the reaction was kept undisturbed for 24 h at room
temperature. Afterward, pH was lowered to acidity, and the suspension
was dialyzed for 72 h in deionized water. To obtain solid samples
of the modified NC (NC–Jeffamine), suspensions were freeze-dried
until complete dehydration.

2.2.3 Characterization
of NC Grafted with a Block
Copolymer
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer using the attenuated total
reflectance mode. The spectral width ranged from 400 to 4000 cm–1, with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and
an accumulation of 32 scans. A PerkinElmer STA 6000 simultaneous analyzer
was used for the thermal analysis. All samples were heated from 30
to 750 °C with a ramp of 20 °C/min in an air atmosphere.
A Malvern Zetasizer Nano series with a 4 mW 632.8 nm laser was used
to determine the average diameter and surface charge of the samples
in aqueous suspension (∼0.1 wt %) at pH 7. A JEOL 6480LV scanning
electron microscope and a Bruker Dimension Edge AFM was used to record
the micrographs. Samples for the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis were suspended in deionized water, and then a drop was placed
onto a carbon-coated copper grid under an air atmosphere until dryness
was achieved. In the case of atomic force microscopy (AFM), a diluted
solution of the sample was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s in a silicon
substrate (1–10 Ω cm) from the International Wafer Service,
Inc. A TriStar II 3020 surface area analyzer was used to determine
the specific surface area of the samples by applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. The degassing temperature was set at 120 °C for
8 h under a N2 flow.

2.2.4 Determination
of the Block Copolymer Content
on the NC Surface
Conductometric titration was used to determine
the content of carboxylic acid groups on the surface of NC after the
oxidation and coupling reactions. An Accumet Basic AB30 conductivity
meter was utilized to monitor the titration of NC samples with an
excess of 0.01 M HCl, using 0.01 M NaOH as the titrant. The resulting
plots showed the volume of NaOH necessary to determine the degree
of oxidation (DO) using the following equation15  where C is the concentration
of NaOH (mol/L), V2 and V1 are the volumes of NaOH (L), and w is
the sample weight (g). Because the coupling reaction modifies the
carboxylic acid into an amide functional group, we can indirectly
determine the block copolymer content on the surface of NC by subtracting
the DO before and after the EDC/sulfo-NHS reaction.

2.2.5 Batch Adsorption Experiments of Contaminants
Batch
adsorption isotherm experiments in the presence of the CECs,
sulfamethoxazole, acetaminophen, and DEET, were carried out at room
temperature under different pH conditions using 50 mL tubes containing
20 mL of the contaminant solution (10–50 mg/L) and modified
NC (0.1 g) as adsorbents. An orbital shaker was employed to create
turbulence, and it was set at 250 rpm to maintain uniformity until
equilibrium (24 h). Then, the solutions were centrifuged at 40 000
rpm to remove the adsorbent. By determining the concentration of the
contaminants before and after the adsorption experiments, the removal
efficiency of the adsorbents was calculated using this equation  where qe is the
equilibrium adsorption amount (mg/g), Co is the initial concentration of the contaminant solution (mg/L), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of the contaminant
(mg/L) after adsorption, V is the volume of the contaminant
solution (L), and w is the mass of modified NC. Emerging
contaminant concentrations were measured by the high-pressure liquid
chromatography analysis using an Agilent 1100 Series VWD equipped
with a Hypersil BDS C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at
25 °C. The flow rate was set at 1 mL/min, and the injection volume
was 30 μL.

2.2.6 Computational Methodological
Details
The calculations were carried out based on the state-of-the-art
density
functional theory (DFT) in a plane-wave pseudopotential method, as
implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.16 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange-correlation
functional with an energy cutoff of 400 eV for the plane wave expansion
and 4 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid for k-point sampling were used in the calculations. The long-range interactions
[van der Waals (vdW)] were considered by adding a semiempirical correction
to the conventional Kohn–Sham DFT energy, that is, dispersion-corrected
DFT-D3 method of Grimme.17 The projector
augmented-wave pseudopotentials16,18 were used for all elements
except hydrogen atoms. To better mimic the experimental conditions
related with the block copolymer content on NC, an orthorhombic supercell
(a = 8.201, b = 20.760, and c = 49.383 Å, see Figure 8) was built based on the experimental lattice
parameters of bulk nanocellulose (NC).19 All atoms were allowed to move during the gradient-minimization
procedure without any internal-coordinates constraint while the cell
parameters were fixed. The binding energy (BE) was calculated by using
the following formula  where ENC/Pol:CEC, ENC/Pol, and ECEC denote the total (DFT + vdW) energy of the
equilibrium
structures for the adsorbent material + CEC, the adsorbent material
(Jeffamine polymer attach to functionalized NC), and CEC, respectively.
The level of accuracy of the present computational methodology is
indicated by comparison with high-level many-body theory computations
of BEs for hydrogen-bonded dimers available in the literature.20 Specifically, the absolute differences of the
computed BEs for formamide and N-methylacetamide
dimers are within ∼1 kcal/mol.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 TEMPO-Mediated Oxidation
of NC
We
performed the TEMPO oxidation of NC by varying the molar ratio of
NaOCl/AGU to assess the optimal reaction conditions. After the reaction,
FTIR was conducted, and the intensity of the carbonyl band corresponding
to the oxidation process was tracked (see Figure S1A). From the intensity ratios of the carbonyl bands from
the FTIR spectra, it was possible to determine the optimal concentration
of NaOCl to successfully complete the reaction. These results were
plotted against the different molar ratios of NaOCl/AGU ranging from
0.05 to 1.0 (Figure S1B). From these results,
it was observed that molar ratios higher than 0.5 NaOCl/AGU did not
significantly increase the DO. This finding suggests that the limit
of possible modifiable hydroxyl groups was reached given the size
of the NC particles.13c The information
obtained from the FTIR spectra was compared to the TGA analysis at
different stages of the reaction (Figure S2), and it was shown that this molar ratio was enough to significantly
decrease the thermostability of NC. Because NaOCl was the only variable
in the different oxidation reactions, it can be argued that NaOCl
plays a major contribution in the structural integrity of NC. Therefore,
to maintain the physical integrity of NC, we opted for lowering the
molar ratio to 0.3 NaOCl/AGU to perform further experiments.

3.2 Block Copolymer Grafting onto Oxidized NC
Jeffamine
ED 600 is a commercially available block copolymer with
a polyether frame consisting of PEG and polypropylene glycol with
terminal amino functional groups (Figure 1). These types of block copolymers are used
to prepare thermo-responsive hydrogels, given their hydrophilicity
at room temperature and formation of sol–gels at higher temperatures.21 Here, Jeffamine ED 600 was grafted onto oxidized
NC to obtain an enhanced hydrophilic composite with increased adsorption
capacities.

Figure 1 Molecular structure of Jeffamine ED 600.

EDC/sulfo-NHS allowed the coupling reaction between the carboxylic
groups on the surface of oxidized NC and the primary amines of Jeffamine
to obtain a covalent amide bond. The ratios of EDC, sulfo-NHS, and
Jeffamine (equivalents of NH2) were set to 4 times in relation
to the oxidized NC.12aScheme 1 shows the details regarding
the chemical changes on the surface before and after grafting Jeffamine
ED 600 onto the surface of NC.

Scheme 1 Steps for Grafting of NC with Block
Copolymer Jeffamine ED 600
FTIR was utilized to measure the amide functional groups
that are
expected to form after the coupling reaction. Figure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of NC (Figure 2a), NC after oxidation (Figure 2b), and NC–Jeffamine
(Figure 2c). The pictograms
at the right side of each spectrum in the same figure represent the
physical structure of NC, with the major functional groups on its
surface. It can be clearly observed that after the TEMPO-mediated
reaction, an intense band around 1600 cm–1 corresponding
to the free salt of carboxyl groups was identified,22 providing strong evidence that corroborates the oxidation
of NC. Moreover, after polymer grafting, a broad band centered at
1650 cm–1 can be observed, which was assigned to
the new amide functional group.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra and structural pictograms
of (a) NC, (b) oxidized
NC, and (c) NC–Jeffamine.

Because the band around 1650 cm–1 in Figure 2c appears to be composed
of several bands, a Gaussian deconvolution was employed (Figure 3) to better determine
the species that were present after the coupling reaction. This deconvolution
revealed that this broad band is composed of at least four different
bands located at ca. 1700, 1650, 1600, and 1550 cm–1. The band around 1550 cm–1 is characteristic of
the bending of N–H, also known as amide II. This band is a
confirmation of the formation of the covalent bond between the block
copolymer and NC.23 Additionally, a band
at 1600 cm–1 corresponding to unreactive carboxylic
groups is present in the final sample. This appreciation is reasonable
if we take into consideration that this band appears at the same position
as that of the FTIR spectrum of oxidized NC. In addition, unreacted
Jeffamine molecules might have remained after the reaction because
of steric impediment with bulky Jeffamine already attached to the
surface of NC. These molecules were further removed after dialysis.
Lastly, a band around 1700 cm–1 was tentatively
interpreted as impurities from the coupling agents sulfo-NHS and EDC,
as seen in Figure S3.

Figure 3 Gaussian deconvolution
of the broad band around 1650 cm–1 of the FTIR spectrum
of NC–Jeffamine.

After confirmation of the successful grafting, we indirectly
determined
the amount of block copolymer on the surface of NC using conductometric
titration. Figure 4 shows the titration plots of oxidized NC and NC–Jeffamine.
The initial steep slope in both curves corresponds to the titration
of excess of HCl, followed by stabilization of the conductivity because
of the titration of the available carboxylic acids on the surface
of NC. The titration finishes with an increase in the conductivity
because of excess of NaOH. After TEMPO oxidation, DO was 0.075, whereas
this value lowered to 0.041 when the block copolymer was grafted.
The degree of substitution of the block copolymer was determined from
these results, and it was found that the difference between the values
before and after block copolymer grafting is 0.033, which indicates
that ca. 45% of the carboxylic groups on the NC surface were converted
or modified to amide groups. This value is in good agreement with
those found in the literature.12a

titration curves of oxidized NC and NC–Jeffamine
and pictograms showing their reacting groups.

To study the thermal stability of NC and modified NC, TGA
was conducted
and is shown in Figure 5. Initially, there is a loss of 5% in mass around 100 °C, followed
by a sharp loss in mass around 300 °C that slowly decreases until
almost no material remains. This sharp decrease in the mass corresponds
to the rapid depolymerization of the outer cellulose chains, whereas
the last step of the process is characteristic of a hierarchical depolymerization
and total carbonization caused by the crystallinity of the NC.7b It is worth to mention that NC–Jeffamine
appears to be less thermally stable than the other species because
a significant decrease in the mass starts at around 250 °C. Other
minor variations in the thermogram trends suggest that the core structure
of NC remains intact, suggesting that the oxidation and grafting conditions
were adequate for the modification of the NC surface.

Figure 5 Thermograms of NC, oxidized
NC, and NC–Jeffamine. The pictograms
at the right show the major process during the heating process.

After chemical characterization,
we were intrigued to determine
the surface area of the material before and after modification. The
specific surface areas of NC, oxidized NC, and NC–Jeffamine
were measured using the N2 adsorption–desorption
method at −196 °C. The BET surface area was 2.4 m2/g for NC, 8.4 m2/g for the oxidized NC, and 15.1
m2/g for NC–Jeffamine. These results represent an
increase in the surface area after oxidation and grafting by almost
4 and 5 times, respectively, compared to that of NC. These resulting
values of the BET surface area studies of NC are consistent with tightly
packed and low porous structures due to strong hydrogen bonding.7a,24 The increase in the surface area after oxidation and grafting can
be attributed to the new functionalities (carboxylic groups and block
copolymer). It is worth mentioning that NaOCl could have promoted
surface roughness because of slight degradation of the glycosidic
bonds in NC during the oxidation; however, because NaOCl was not used
in the grafting reaction, the further increase of the surface area
can only be related to the presence of the block copolymer in the
NC surface. SEM images were acquired to account for morphological
changes in the sample that would provide more insights on the modification
process. From the SEM images of NC (Figures 6a and S4a), oxidized
NC (Figures 6b and S4b), and an AFM image of NC–Jeffamine
(Figures 6c and S4b), it can be observed that the structure of
NC has no significant differences after oxidation and grafting. This
result suggests that only the surface of NC underwent modification.
Moreover, this corroborates the findings from the surface analysis
and can explain why only a minor increase in the surface area was
obtained after the modifications.

Figure 6 SEM images of (a) NC, (b) oxidized NC,
and (c) AFM deflection image
of NC–Jeffamine.

To characterize NC and modified NC in aqueous solutions,
analysis
with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Z-potential was performed
to determine the average size and surface charge, respectively. Figure 7 show the DLS histograms,
and Table 1 summarizes
the findings for this analysis.

Figure 7 DLS histograms of (a) NC, (b) oxidized
NC, and (c) NC–Jeffamine.

Table 1 Z-Average Size and
Z-Potential of NC and Modified NC
sample	Z-average (nm)	polydispersive index	Z-potential (mV)	
NC	130 ± 2	0.189 ± 0.008	–54 ± 2	
oxidized NC	121.0 ± 0.7	0.18 ± 0.01	–58 ± 1	
NC–Jeffamine	190 ± 2	0.243 ± 0.05	–33 ± 1	
DLS measures the hydrodynamic
diameter of the particles assuming
a spherical shape and taking into consideration their translational
diffusion coefficient. NC has a rodlike shape; because the overall
translational diffusion coefficients of rods with a defined length
are equivalent to the sphere counterparts, the hydrodynamic diameter
strongly correlates with the particle length.25 The measured sizes of NC and oxidized NC are similar, with a slight
decrease in the case of oxidized NC. On the other hand, NC–Jeffamine
shows a significant increase in the diameter, from 130 to 190 nm.
The resulting size distributions in DLS are in good agreement with
those observed in SEM except for NC–Jeffamine, which is significantly
bigger when it was measured by DLS. NC–Jeffamine in aqueous
solution has a greater hydrodynamic diameter, given the contribution
of the extended hydrophilic block copolymer toward the aqueous medium.
This last statement reinforces the idea of successful attachment of
the block copolymer Jeffamine ED 600 to the surface of NC.

In
the case of the Z-potential results, it is clear that the addition
of Jeffamine decreases the surface charge of NC. In this case, the
surface charge measured by the Z-potential was useful to determine
the presence of Jeffamine on the surface of NC. Aqueous dispersion
of NC has a surface charge of −54 mV, which is related to the
presence of negatively charged sulfate groups on its surface that
maintain the particles in suspension and avoid aggregation by electrostatic
repulsion.7b After oxidation, these sulfate
groups are replaced by negatively charged carboxyl groups that result
in a slight increase of the negative charge on the surface. On the
other hand, the introduction of the neutral Jeffamine polymer substitutes
almost 50% of the carboxylates on the surface for amide groups. This
explains why the net charge is less negative than the other species.

3.3 Sorption Isotherms of CECs
To measure
the adsorption capacity of NC–Jeffamine toward acetaminophen,
sulfamethoxazole, and DEET, batch experiments were performed at pH
3.0, 7.0, and 9.0, and the results were fit to the mathematical nonlinear
models of Langmuir and Freundlich.26 The
results are presented in Table 2. For acetaminophen, there was no significant adsorption at
acidic pH, whereas at neutral and basic pH values, adsorption was
evident, it being higher under basic conditions. However, for sulfamethoxazole,
higher adsorption was observed at both acidic and basic pH values,
with adsorption at pH 9.0 being slightly higher. On the other hand,
DEET adsorption increased as a function of pH. In terms of the mathematical
models, acetaminophen had a better fitting with the Freundlich model
at basic pH, meanwhile, sulfamethoxazole had a better fitting at acidic
pH with both Langmuir and Freundlich models. DEET was consistent along
the pH range measured, with the Freundlich models presenting a better
fit. Batch adsorption experiments using NC or oxidized NC were not
successful because no significant adsorption was obtained (Table S1).

Table 2 Isotherms Plot for
the Adsorption
of CECs at Different pH values
To analyze the adsorption isotherms of the different
CECs, it is
important to take into consideration the structural changes that both
NC–Jeffamine and CECs undergo at different pH values. Because
of the presence of unreactive carboxylic groups on the surface of
NC–Jeffamine, the dispersion of the particles in aqueous solution
is affected by pH. As seen in Figure S5, at acidic pH, the particles are in an aggregated state forming
a viscous slurry. This phenomenon occurs due to protonation of the
carboxylates to form neutral carboxylic acids. Under this condition,
hydrogen bonds overcome the electrostatic repulsions of the particles.
As pH increases, the formation of negatively charged carboxylates
restores the electrostatic interactions of the particles to obtain
well-defined aqueous suspensions. The adsorption of all of the CECs
increases at pH 9, as seen in Table 2. It can be suggested that the better dispersity of
NC–Jeffamine in the solution favors the interaction with the
contaminants and enhances the adsorption. In the case of CECs, pKa plays an important role in the solubility
and the net charge of each one. Acetaminophen has a pKa of 9.5,27 which means that
at basic pH, it has a net negative charge. That behavior can explain
why there is almost no adsorption at pH 3; it is possible that acetaminophen
remained insoluble in the aqueous solution during the adsorption experiment,
which decreased the possibility of effective interactions with NC–Jeffamine.
Sulfamethoxazole and DEET have acid pKa values of 5.6 and 2.00, respectively.28 Besides the aggregation of NC at acid pH, the adsorption of sulfamethoxazole
is considerable. The adsorption is possibly driven by the electrostatic
interactions of positively charged sulfamethoxazole and the surface
of NC–Jeffamine. This phenomenon can also help to understand
the relatively good fitting of both Langmuir and Freundlich models
in terms of the possibility that ions of sulfamethoxazole can form
successive layers on the surface of aggregated NC–Jeffamine.29 In the case of DEET, the adsorption is more
consistent with the increase of the solution pH. Because pKa is considerably low, there is no chance to
obtain a charged molecule under the studied conditions. The formation
of nonspecific interactions between DEET and NC–Jeffamine is
more probable, given the poor correlation with the two mathematical
models.

3.4 Computed BEs
On the basis of the
finding that the experimental adsorption of CECs onto NC and oxidized
NC was negligible in this study, the computational effort was focused
on NC–Jeffamine. Figure 8 shows the atomistic models
for the oxidized NC surface (composed of four chemical formulas of
oxidized cellulose), a supercell containing four unit cells of NC–Jeffamine,
and the equilibrium structure for the adsorption site of acetaminophen
onto NC–Jeffamine. The elucidation of the minimum-energy atomistic
structures and BEs computationally obtained helps to understand how
the adsorption of CECs onto NC–Jeffamine takes place and the
nature of interaction between them. A variety of intermolecular interactions,
such as moderate hydrogen bonds and vdW forces, are the reason for
adsorption of CECs onto NC–Jeffamine. In the case of acetaminophen,
two hydrogen bonds (hb1 and hb2) are established (see Figure 8); the bond lengths are 2.02
Å for hb1 and 2.29 Å for hb2, and the contribution of vdW
interactions to its BE is 14.549 kcal/mol of 21.17 kcal/mol. For sulfamethoxazole,
one hydrogen bond is made with a bond length of 2.28 Å (see Figure S6a), and the vdW contribution to the
BE is 7.21 kcal/mol of 14.32 kcal/mol. Finally, for DEET, the contribution
to the BE is almost because of the vdW interactions, which account
for 5.70 kcal/mol of the 8.37 kcal/mol total BE (see Figure S6b). In all cases, the adsorption of CECs onto NC–Jeffamine
does not affect the atomistic structure of overall NC–Jeffamine
drastically; this can be observed by direct comparison of Figures 8c and S6.

NC, (b) 2 × 2 × 1 supercell of NC–Jeffamine, and

structure for acetaminophen adsorbed on NC–Jeffamine through

4 Conclusions
In this research, we demonstrate the feasibility of the adsorption
of CECs using the environmental friendly NC–Jeffamine that
we synthetized/characterized by experimental (adsorption isotherms)
and computational methods (atomistic structures and BEs energies).
We successfully attached Jeffamine ED 600 to oxidized NC to obtain
nanoparticles with an aspect ratio similar to that of the precursor,
as suggested from the SEM imaging and DLS analysis, but with a higher
surface area (BET analysis) and hydrophilicity conferred by the polymer
chains. These new physical properties allowed the adsorption of acetaminophen,
sulfamethoxazole, and DEET at pH 3, 7, and 9 by means of electrostatic
interactions with the polymer arrangements on the surface of the nanoparticle.
The computational calculations resulted in BEs of 21.17, 14.32, and
8.37 kcal/mol for acetaminophen, sulfamethoxazole, and DEET, respectively,
related to hydrogen bonds and/or vdW interactions with the polymer
chain. These computational results clearly indicate the adsorption
of CECs onto NC–Jeffamine on the molecular level and its agreement
with the adsorption trends that were experimentally obtained for all
those CECs at neutral pH. This investigation has placed a fundamental
basis that encourages further research on the production of eco-friendly
materials based on the polymer grafted onto a biomaterial surface
and their use for the remediation of contaminants from aqueous media.
