Recently,
we synthesized a one-dimensional (1D) structure of V2Se9. The 1D V2Se9 resembles
another 1D material, Nb2Se9, which is expected
to have a direct band gap. To determine the potential applications
of this material, we calculated the band structures of 1D and bulk
V2Se9 using density functional theory by varying
the number of chains and comparing their band structures and electronic
properties with those of Nb2Se9. The results
showed that a small number of V2Se9 chains have
a direct band gap, whereas bulk V2Se9 possesses
an indirect band gap, like Nb2Se9. We expect
that V2Se9 nanowires with diameters less than
∼20 Å would have direct band gaps. This indirect-to-direct
band gap transition could lead to potential optoelectronic applications
for this 1D material because materials with direct band gaps can absorb
photons without being disturbed by phonons.

Introduction
The development of
low-dimensional materials has launched different
approaches to materials research for many promising applications.1,2 Two-dimensional (2D) materials are composed of planar crystalline
sheets stabilized by strong in-plane bonds and weak interlayer interactions.
Because graphene was first separated from graphite, graphene-based
applications in electronics, chemistry, and mechanics have been intensively
studied due to graphene’s superior physical properties (e.g.,
high charge carrier mobility and mechanical strength). However, graphene
does not have a band gap and so is difficult to develop with transistors.3,4 If graphene is finely patterned with narrow widths, a band gap can
be formed.3 Unfortunately, as the width
of graphene decreases, the band gap increases, and the electron mobility
sharply decreases. Other 2D materials with appropriate band gaps,
including transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and black phosphorus,
have been introduced.5−11 Similar to graphene, a dramatic reduction in charge carrier mobility
due to edge scattering is inevitable after device manufacture.12 The reduction of dimensionality also can influence
the charge transfer, the structure of the crystal, spin property,
or the charge carrier mobility in the metal nanowire system.13−19

Other types of one-dimensional (1D) materials, such as Mo6S9–xIx, Sb2Se3, and VS4, have been
studied
by several researchers.20−26 Because they are formed by periodically stacking single-chain atomic
crystals (SCACs) that have strong intrachain bonds with weak van der
Waals (vdW) interchain interactions, these 1D materials are prepared
by isolating SCACs from bulk crystals (similar to 2D materials). The
structural characteristics of 1D materials result in a surface free
from dangling bonds which hinder application of 2D materials.27,28 However, it is difficult to clearly determine the crystal structure
of Mo6S9–xIx because the positions of the sulfur and iodine ions
coordinated to the central molybdenum ions may vary, even at the same
stoichiometric composition. In addition, the thermodynamic properties
of the ternary system (Mo–S–I) are not well known, which
makes it difficult to understand the physical properties of the Mo6S9–xIx material. In addition, Sb2Se3 and VS4 have not been reported experimentally as 1D atomic dispersions.

Very recently, other semiconducting 1D materials, such as Nb2Se9 and V2Se9, were reported
to be successfully synthesized by solid-state reactions.29,30 These materials can be separated as 1D nanowires up to a single-atomic
chain size because of the weak vdW interactions between the selenium
ions surrounding the inorganic chains. There are two approaches for
preparing the nanowires: (i) mechanical exfoliation, which is similar
to the conventional experimental set-ups used in 2D (e.g., graphene,
boron nitride, and TMDCs) research,31 and
(ii) chemical exfoliation, which occurs by designing an appropriate
solvent and dispersant.32−34 Based on these two exfoliation
methods, the bulk materials can be separated up to 1 nm in thickness
[as experimentally confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM)]; the
separated materials can be a single unit of the inorganic chain. In
this report, we performed theoretical calculations to investigate
the potential optoelectronic applications of V2Se9 chains after disintegration of bulk V2Se9 crystals
into single V2Se9 chains.

The calculations
showed that V2Se9 SCACs
would have direct band gaps, whereas bulk V2Se9 would have an indirect band gap. As in Nb2Se9,35 the band gap decreased by increasing
the number of chains from 1.09 eV (single chain) to 0.54 eV (bulk).
The band structures of single, double, triple, and septuple SCAC bundles
were similar, but they were different from that of the bulk structure.
We investigated the effects of vdW interchain interactions by adding
the dispersion energy correction to the structural optimization. The
dispersion energy decreased the band gaps but did not alter the indirect-to-direct
band gap transition trend significantly, whereas the dispersion energy
was important in predicting the direct band gap of the double-layer
MoS2.36

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
calculated band structures of bulk and few-chain systems, from the
high symmetry point M to point Γ. Full band
structures can be found in Supporting Information Figures S1–S5. Unlike 2D materials, a collection of 1D materials
can have various arrangements. The lowest energy arrangements of the
double and triple chains were chosen for the band structure calculation.
Triangular arrangement of triple-chain V2Se9 is more stable than linear V2Se9, which implies
that aggregation stabilizes the energy of V2Se9 SCACs. Thus, we calculated the band structure of hexagonally stacked
septuple-chain bundles for seven chains. As Figure 1a presents, bulk V2Se9 had an indirect band gap of 0.54 eV from point Γ to a point
(0.419, 0, 0.419) near M (0.5, 0, 0.5), designated
as T. However, all 1D few-chain systems had direct
band gaps that increased as the number of chains decreased. The maximum
band gap was 1.09 eV in a single chain. Direct band gaps appeared
at point Γ, a local minimum point in the conduction bands of
few-chain systems but a local maximum point of the bulk structure.
Point Γ was a local energy maximum in the few-chain system,
unlike in the bulk system. The band energies of the conduction band
at point Γ decreased as the number of chains increased in the
few-chain systems. However, the conduction band at point T increased with the number of few-chain systems, whereas the conduction
band energy of T in the bulk was minimal. This implies
that the stacking effect on the energy at point Γ in the bulk
is different from that in the few-chain systems. The partial orbital
analysis showed that point Γ had larger contributions to pz and dz2 orbitals than did T (Figure S6). The different aspects of
the conduction band near point M is the reason that
bulk V2Se9 has an indirect band gap while the
few-chain V2Se9 shows direct band gaps. The
difference between the valence bands of bulk and few-chain systems
is much smaller than the difference between the conduction bands.
The number of chains has little influence on the valence band of few-chain
and bulk V2Se9. The band structures of V2Se9 without the DFT-D3 dispersion energy correction
are similar to the band structures with the DFT-D3, but the band gaps
increase (Table S1).

Figure 1 Part of band structures
of (a) bulk, (b) 7-chain, (c) triple, (d)
double, and (e) single SCAC(s) V2Se9 from point M to point Γ. The zero energy is shifted to the maximum
energy of valence band. The structures are optimized by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) method with the DFT-D3 energy correction. Inset graphics represent
the corresponding optimized structures of bulk and few-chain V2Se9.

We compared the band
structures of V2Se9 with
those of Nb2Se9. The band structures of Nb2Se9 with dispersion energy correction are shown
in Figure S7. All few-chain systems have
similar band structures in both V2Se9 and Nb2Se9. The valence bands of SCACs and bulk are also
similar in both Nb2Se9 and in V2Se9. The contribution of selenium is greater than that of vanadium
to the partial density of state both for the bulk and few-chain systems
except the double chain (Figure S8). Screening
of inner vanadium ions by outer selenium ions prevents the conduction
band from being perturbed by other chains. The interactions between
chains mainly change the characteristics related to selenium ions.
However, the few V2Se9 chains have electronic
bands with many valleys, whereas the few Nb2Se9 chains carry structureless bands.

All few-chain systems calculated
previously have similar properties
to a single chain. To determine the boundary between such few-chain
systems and bulk systems, we plotted the changes in the band gap for
a number of V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 chains, as in Figure 2. The band gap decreases as the number of chains increases, as does
the change of the band gap. We expected that a decrease in the band
gap (ΔE) by the number of chains (n) would approach the band gap in bulk V2Se9 at 0.54 eV and Nb2Se9 at 0.65 eV. We interpolated
the tendency between ΔE and n as an exponential curve. From this interpolation, n satisfying |ΔE(n) –
ΔEbulk| < 0.01 eV, where ΔEbulk is the band gap of the bulk system, is
expected to be greater than 24 in V2Se9 and
20 in Nb2Se9. These numbers of chains can construct
a triple-layer bundle with hexagonal stacking. The short interchain
distance between two V2Se9 chains is 6.79 Å
and the distance between two Nb2Se9 chains is
6.86 Å. Therefore, the shortest diameter of a triple-layer V2Se9 bundle is approximately 20.37 Å, and that
of a triple-layer Nb2Se9 bundle is approximately
20.58 Å (supposing the cross-section of a bundle is an ellipse).
The exponential function decays fast, and the number of chains enough
to have a band gap similar to the bulk from exponential interpolation
could be the lower bound. Thus, we believe that V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 SCACs thinner than about
∼20 Å would have the characteristics of single chains,
such as a direct band gap. In the previous study of Nb2Se9 without dispersion correction, a value of 36 Å
was suggested.35

Figure 2 Band gap (ΔE) changes by the number of chains
(n) of V2Se9 and Nb2Se9. calc. and interpol. abbreviate calculation and interpolation,
respectively. As n increases, ΔE decreases to the bulk band gap of 0.54 eV in V2Se9 and 0.65 eV in Nb2Se9, as represented
by dashed lines. We interpolated the band gap changes to exponential
curves such that ΔE = 0.60 e–0.17n + 0.54 for V2Se9 and ΔE = 0.70 e–0.21n + 0.65
for Nb2Se9.

The dispersion energy does not change the band gap transition trend
in V2Se9 and Nb2Se9, although
it is significant in 2D MoS2. The reason is that such 1D
materials have remarkably different conduction bands than the bulk
material. With MoS2, the 2D and 3D structures have a similar
band structure to that of bulk MoS2. The dispersion energy
changes the size of the indirect and direct band gaps, while the positions
of the band gaps are maintained. However, 1D few-chain V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 have significantly
different band structures compared to those of 3D bulk structures.
Unlike 2D TMDC, the effect of dispersion energy in these 1D material
changes the positions of the indirect and direct band gaps. We expect
that there would be bundles of V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 whose band structures have intermediate shape
between that of a single chain and that of the bulk material, with
the number of chains in these bundles more than seven.

Table 1 summarizes
the characteristics of V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 calculated by PBE + DFT-D3. The band gap differences
between the bulk and a single chain are similar in these materials.
The size of the V2Se9 chain is 0.1 Å smaller
than that of Nb2Se9, and the band gap of the
bulk material and single chain of V2Se9 is 0.1
eV smaller than that of Nb2Se9. The physical
properties related to the band gaps and the structures of chains in
these two 1D materials are similar.

Conclusions
Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
we found that
1–7 V2Se9 SCAC structures would have
direct band gaps, whereas bulk V2Se9 would have
an indirect band gap, like Nb2Se9 SCACs.35 By interpolation, we predicted that a 1D V2Se9 chain with a diameter less than ∼ 20 Å
would have a direct band gap. Additionally, we investigated the effect
of vdW interactions between chains on the DFT-D3 energy correction.
DFT-D3 correction maintained the structures of V2Se9 bulk and SCAC roughly, but the interchain distances were
reduced. Band gaps of few chain systems decrease as the number of
chains increases, with and without DFT-D3 correction, and finally
approach the band gaps of the bulk structure. The band structures
of SCACs with 1–7 chains are similar, and DFT-D3 optimization
retains the band structures of V2Se9 systems
qualitatively; however, the band gaps were reduced by DFT-D3 correction.
The optimized structures and band gaps for various numbers of chains
of V2Se9 showed similar characteristics to those
of Nb2Se9. The dispersion energy does not change
the band structure of these 1D materials, nor does it affect the indirect-to-direct
band gap transition, unlike in the 2D material MoS2.

This distinctive 1D material V2Se9 could
be used in optoelectronic devices because it can absorb photon energy
without being disturbed by phonons. The charge mobility calculation
of 1D V2Se9 is needed to determine whether there
are further applications for the field effect transistors that require
a direct band gap and appropriately fast mobility, as with 2D MoS2.37,38 The spin property of this 1D material is
also needed to be analyzed in future research. The 1D materials have
higher surface-to-volume ratios and no dangling bonds, unlike the
2D materials; therefore, the 1D material V2Se9 described in this study seems to be a promising material in nanoelectronics.

Structures
and Computational Methods
Figure 3a shows
the crystal structure of V2Se9, which is a periodic
array of unit V2Se9 SCACs. Bulk V2Se9 crystals were prepared via the flux method using excess
molten selenium as a solvent. When the V–Se liquid at 330 °C
was cooled to room temperature, dark grey needles precipitated. Figure 3b shows a scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of the V2Se9 needles prepared in this study. To demonstrate the characteristics
of the chain-stacked structure of the V2Se9,
the bulk V2Se9 crystal was cleaved using a conventional
peeling method.39Figure 3c shows the AFM images of V2Se9 chains exfoliated from bulk V2Se9 crystals.
The exfoliated chains had thicknesses of 1.1, 6.9, and 7.5 nm, indicating
that single chains (1.1 nm) or bundles (6.9 and 7.5 nm) could be generated
by mechanical exfoliation (Figure 3d). This result shows that weak vdW interactions among
the chains in the bulk crystal results in V2Se9 crystals cleaved to V2Se9 chains, as in typical
2D materials.The bulk structure of V2Se9 has
a monoclinic symmetry (C2/c). The
unit of V2Se9 chain structures consists of four
vanadium and 18 selenium ions, as in Nb2Se9.
A V4Se18 chain structure is composed of two
V2Se4 octahedrons connected by Se5; each octahedron faces the other octahedron (Figure 4a).40 The relative
coordinates of ions in the reference direct the chains to [1 0 1].
We rotated the lattice vectors to a set of ([1 0 1], [0 1 0], and
[1 0 1̅]). Then, 1D structures consisting of the number of finite
chains could be constructed by repeating k-points
into the x-axis in computational chemistry software.
This rotated unit cell has three whole chain units and two half-chain
units (Figure 4b,c).
To validate the rotated frame, we calculated the band structures for
the original and rotated lattice vector choices and compared the band
gaps (see Figure S9).

of V2Se9 single-lattice cells, which
are rotated from the reference structure to direct the length of the
chains to the [1 0 0] axis. (a) Two V4Se18 chain
units are shown, consisting of V2Se4 octahedrons
and Se5 connecting the octahedrons. The numbering of selenium
and vanadium ions follows those of the reference.40 An inclined view (b) and projected view (c) to the plane
perpendicular to the length of chains are shown. A single cell has
four chains. Two chains are stacked in the bottom of the unit cell
as the first layer, and two chains are stacked on the top of the unit
cell as the second layer. Two layers are shifted by a half-length
between chains in each layer.

We constructed few-chain systems that have single, double, triple,
and septuple chain(s) by repeating the rotated unit cell to obtain
the target chain arrangements and by removing redundancies. After
the formation of the initial few SCAC systems, we optimized the structures
of SCACs and bulk V2Se9. The calculation was
performed using the projected augmented wave method41,42 in the Vienna Ab-Initio Package (VASP).43−46 Computational details are presented
in the Supporting Information.

A
theoretical calculation predicted that Nb2Se9 SCACs would have direct band gaps, bulk Nb2Se9 would have an indirect band gap, and the band gaps would increase
as the number of chains decreased.35 These
phenomena are mainly caused by vdW interchain interactions. Previous
studies of metal chalcogenides used only the generalized gradient
approximation method,35,47,48 which cannot properly describe vdW effects; therefore, further calculations
were performed to incorporate vdW interactions.36,49 We chose the DFT-D3 method, which introduces the dispersion energy
correction proportional to 1/r6.50,51 To investigate the effects of vdW interactions, we optimized the
structures with and without the DFT-D3 correction and then compared
the atomic structures and band structures of SCACs and bulk V2Se9. Indeed, when the dispersion correction was
applied, the structure further approached the experimental reference
structure (Table S2). The dispersion energy
correction decreases the interchain distances of bulk and all SCAC
V2Se9 and Nb2Se9 (Tables S3–S5 and Figures S10 and S11).

By looking at the electron localization
function of the single
chain and bulk V2Se9, we identified the bonding
characters: the two Se–Se bondings in V2Se4 octahedron and two Se–Se bondings in Se5 are covalent,
and the Se–V bondings are ionic. Accordingly, we expect that
the charge valence of V2Se9 would be (V5+)2(Se22–)4Se2–. It implies that the system would be diamagnetic
because there is no unpaired electron.
