The device architecture of solar cells remains critical in achieving high photoconversion
efficiency while affordable and scalable routes are being explored.
Here, we demonstrate a scalable, low cost, and less toxic synthesis
route for the fabrication of PbS/CdS thin-film solar cells with efficiencies
as high as ∼5.59%, which is the highest efficiency obtained
so far for the PbS-based solar cells not involving quantum dots. The
devices use a stack of two band-aligned junctions that facilitates
absorption of a wider range of the solar spectrum and an architectural
modification of the electron-accepting electrode assembly consisting
of a very thin CdS layer (∼10 nm) supported by vertically aligned
ZnO nanorods on a ∼50 nm thick ZnO underlayer. Compared to
a planar electrode of a 50 nm thick CdS film, the modified electrode
assembly enhanced the efficiency by ∼39% primarily due to a
significantly higher photon absorption in the PbS layer, as revealed
by a detailed three-dimensional finite difference time-domain optoelectronic
modeling of the device.

Introduction
Solution-processed
PbS-based thin-film solar cells have drawn tremendous
research interest in recent years for their potential in large area,
high throughput, and affordable solar energy conversion.1−5 Intensified research has culminated in a remarkable progress in
the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) from <1% to better than 8%
in a time span of less than a decade.1−6 The high performing solar cells utilize a two dimensionally constricted
assembly of individually surface passivated PbS quantum dots, which
assist in harnessing a wide range of the solar spectrum due to their
band gap tunability. Notwithstanding the favorable optoelectronic
properties, the surface chemistry resulting from the passivation of
the quantum dots and their packing have been shown to critically affect
the performance of the devices.7,8 The concerted efforts
over the years have witnessed diverse techniques employed to achieve
the desired passivation with substantially reduced density of trap
states on surface and the close packing of the quantum dots, which
is critical for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer.
Despite the promise and rapid progress of the PbS quantum dot-based
solar cells, the complex and elaborate processes of surface passivation
and poor stability have raised serious issues on the fabrication of
scalable low-cost devices.9,10

While seeking
an affordable approach to synthesize the PbS absorber
layer that would offer the facile tunability of band gap similar to
that of the quantum dots without involving multistep chemical processing
and/or without ligand engineering, recently, we have shown that the
chemical bath deposition (CBD) method could be a viable option.11,12 For the CBD PbS thin films, the optoelectronic properties, including
band gap, are determined by the process parameters, such as temperature,
composition, etc., that can be easily tailored. A promising PCE, as
high as 4.03%, was obtained for photovoltaic devices employing a stack
of a pair of CBD PbS layers of varying band gaps.12 The architectural modification involving stacking of the
band gap-tailored PbS films without any intervening layer facilitated
better absorption of a wider range of solar spectrum resulting in
better PCE, compared to a single PbS layer. Although the obtained
photovoltaic performance is the highest for any PbS thin film-based
device not involving colloidal quantum dots,13,14 we seek to address the need for further improvement in the PCE of
the devices.

One of the limiting factors of the performance
of the PbS quantum
dot-based solar cells has been the inherent compromise between the
light absorption and carrier extraction.4 Although a complete absorption of above band gap photons requires
a film thickness of 1 μm, the very short diffusion length of
carriers has compelled the thickness of the PbS layer to a smaller
length scale of less than 250 nm for their efficient extraction. Recent
attempts to enhance the current from this limited thickness of the
absorber layer have witnessed the development of depleted p–n
heterojunctions, which ensured the transport of excitons through drift
compared to the diffusion-only mode by leveraging the built-in electric
potential in the depletion region.15 Although
the depleted heterojunction solar cells fared better than their Schottky
counterparts, their efficiencies were below that expected from the
near-IR (NIR) band gap PbS layers. Concurrent widening of the depletion
width and increasing thickness of the absorber layer were suggested
to overcome this performance limitation. By extending this concept
in an architecture engineering approach, vertically oriented nanowire
arrays fully infiltrated with quantum dots, now known as bulk depleted
heterojunction, have shown better photovoltaic characteristics.16−19 These devices enable exciton dissociation and transfer in the nanoscale
regime taking advantage of the nanostructured underlayer, wherein
the vertically aligned one-dimensional structure provides a higher
interfacial area between the active material and efficient electron
transport pathways.16−20 However, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) is still below that
desired for commercialization and scalable production of PbS-based
photovoltaics, necessitating exploration of other avenues to improve
performance.

Our approach to boost the performance of the cells
is based on
devising an alternate electron-accepting electrode assembly. So far,
the efforts on the bulk depleted heterojunction have concentrated
on deposition of PbS quantum dots directly on n-type TiO217−19 or ZnO nanorod (NR) arrays (NRAs),20−22 wherein the uniformity
of NR length, diameter, and spacing are critical in that quantum dots
must reach the bottom of the rods for efficient coupling. We envisioned
that this experimental limitation can be overcome with an alternate
electrode assembly of an extremely thin planar n-type layer sandwiched
between the PbS film and the NR array. In such a configuration, the
PbS layer can be fully photoexploited from its limited thickness of
sub-250 nm and can contribute to a higher current collection, all
the while avoiding the complex processing of the PbS quantum dots.
We show in this work that the performance can be significantly improved
by depositing the PbS absorber layer (∼250 nm) on a very thin
CdS film (∼10 nm) supported by vertically aligned ZnO NRs (∼200
nm long) on a ∼50 nm thick ZnO underlayer: the PCE increases
by a massive 39% compared with the reference device that used only
a planar electrode in the form of a 50 nm thick CdS film.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a represents
the schematics of the ZnO-based solar cell structures, that is, planar
and NR-based structures. Solar cells with double PbS absorber layers
having optical bandgaps of 0.92 and 1.61 eV were prepared on the fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO)-coated soda lime silicate glass substrate by solution-based
processes. Three different device architectures were studied in this
work. The reference device has the structure of Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61
eV)/CdS/FTO/glass. The other two devices included ZnO layers, namely
planar (Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61 eV)/CdS/ZnO/FTO/glass) and NR-based
(Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61 eV)/CdS/ZnO NR/ZnO/FTO/glass). The length
and diameter of the NR were ∼200 and ∼45 nm, respectively.

solar cells. (b) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs of

(FFT) diffraction patterns of PbS thin films deposited at 40 and 80
°C are shown.

Figure 1b shows
a top view SEM image of the array of ZnO NRs grown on the seed layer
on the FTO glass substrate. The image clearly shows the growth of
near-parallel vertically aligned and uniformly spaced ZnO NRs. The
diameter of the NRs was in the range of 25–45 nm, whereas the
inter-NR spacing between the ZnO NRs was about 50–100 nm. It
is worth noting that the inter-NR spacing is an important factor to
obtain pore-free uniformly spaced ZnO NRs. The diameter of the NRs
was in the precursor solution between the NRs thereby increasing the
junction area.21,23 The inter-NR spacing between
ZnO NRs in this study is assumed to be appropriate for the desirable
structure. Figure 1c depicts the TEM image of the ZnO NRs. The NRs of wurtzite phase
were uniform in size without tapering along the growth direction.
The d-spacing of 0.26 nm between two adjacent (0002)
lattice planes in the NRs was identified, as shown in the inset of Figure 1c. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern of the ZnO NRs also exhibited preferred c axis orientation, as demonstrated in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 1d shows a cross-sectional TEM image of the
PbS/CdS/ZnO NR array/ZnO/FTO structure. Owing to the presumable hydrophilic
nature of the precursor solutions, the aqueous sulfide precursor solution
is deeply infiltrated into the interior of ZnO NRs and then forms
effectively the sulfide layers without pores or voids. Figure 1e,f shows the surface microstructures
of PbS thin films deposited at 40 and 80 °C, respectively, which
demonstrates significant difference in the crystallite size. Corresponding
fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction patterns of the PbS thin
films are also shown. The d-spacing values of 0.34
and 0.30 nm were observed for the (111) and (200) planes of PbS films
processed at 40 and 80 °C, respectively.

The measured current
density–voltage (J–V) curves for devices
under AM1.5 G (100 mW/cm2) solar
irradiation are shown in Figure 2a. The representative values of the key parameters,
such as VOC, JSC, FF, and η for the devices have been listed in the inset table
of Figure 2. Compared
to the reference, that is, the reported device without the ZnO layer
and NRs,12 the devices exhibited noticeable
improvements in the performance. The device with the electron-accepting
electrode assembly consisting of a 10 nm thick CdS supported by a
50 nm thick ZnO underlayer demonstrated a photoconversion efficiency
(PCE) of about 4.35%, with JSC = 23.7 mA/cm2, VOC = 0.332 V, and FF = 55.1%. The marginal improvement
in PCE originates from the increase in VOC from 0.276 to 0.332 V. The device with the NR-supported electrode
assembly showed superior photovoltaic properties, with a nearly 39%
improvement in PCE with respect to the reference device. It eventually
resulted in a PCE of 5.59 ± 0.18% with a significant enhancement
in JSC. Considering the planar and the
NR-based devices, the increase of the junction area might cause an
increase of surface recombination and resulted in a decreased VOC and FF in the NR-based device.21 Even with the decreased VOC and FF values, the significantly improved JSC led to the highest PCE. The origin of the boost in JSC is due to the enhanced exciton dissociation
and charge collection facilitated by the NR array.21,24,25 ZnO NR can create a short and direct pathway
for charge transport and increase the p–n junction area between
the ZnO NR-based CdS and the PbS absorber, resulting in a higher photocurrent.26

eV)/CdS/ZnO/FTO/glass) and NR-based (Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61 eV)/CdS/ZnO
NR/ZnO/FTO/glass) devices. (b) Schematic cross-sectional view of the
NR-based solar cell and (c) the actual energy band diagram across
dotted line in (b). The PbS layer represents stack of two PbS layers
of band gap of 1.61 and 0.92 eV. Top contact Al is deposited onto
the 0.92 eV band gap PbS layer. The NRs provide a direct path of electron
transfer to the electrode. The photovoltaic characteristics of the
reference sample was reported in ref (12).

The ZnO NR-based device is expected to enhance the absorption
range
from the visible to near-IR region, which implies effective collection
of electrons in the ZnO NR array device that has a longer penetration
depth compared to that of the planar ZnO-based device. The proposed
mechanism is depicted in Figure 2b,c, wherein a schematic cross-sectional view and the
corresponding energy band diagram are, respectively, given. As shown
in Figure 2b, the vertically
aligned ZnO NRs are likely to offer an efficient conduction path by
supplying a shorter charge-transport pathway to the electrode. The
band alignment between the CdS and the stacked PbS layers has been
discussed in detail earlier,12 wherein
we have suggested that the wider band gap PbS layer (band gap of 1.61
eV) being only 100 nm thick is depleted entirely and the splitting
of the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels under illumination strongly
favored efficient carrier transport. As presented in Figure 2c, the corresponding energy
level diagram of different layers in the device referenced to the
vacuum level was depicted on the basis of the reported energy levels.11,27 The valence band edge of the CdS layer being far below that of the
adjacent PbS layer results in a large barrier for hole injection into
the electron-accepting CdS layer, and simultaneously a large conduction
band offset of 0.96 eV prevents the back transfer of the photoexcited
electrons from the CdS to the PbS layer, leading to the suppression
of carrier recombination.11,28,29 In addition, the energy values of the FTO and ZnO layers indicate
strongly favorable band alignment for efficient charge collection.
On the other hand, for the PbS (1.61 eV)/PbS (0.92 eV), a staggered
type II heterojunction where hole concentration differs by two orders,
the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels split under illumination.11 Starting from the CdS/PbS (1.61 eV) junction,
the splitting gradually increased to ∼0.3 eV and marginally
decreased at the PbS (1.61 eV)/PbS (0.92 eV) junction and remained
constant at ∼0.25 eV throughout the 0.92 eV PbS layer. The
favorable sloping of the quasi-Fermi levels facilitates carrier transport
for better photovoltaic performance. While this work presents the
highest efficiency of any PbS thin film-based solar cells not involving
colloidal quantum dots, the scope for further improvement lies in
elucidating the effects of NR dimensions, density, inter-NR spacing,
etc.

We validated our experimental results on positive contribution
toward enhancement of photovoltaic characteristics through the three-dimensional
finite difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) optoelectronic modeling. Figure 3 shows the device
architectures used for the modeling and the FDTD results for the electric
field intensity (E2) distribution for
the reference device and devices with the planar and NR ZnO underlayer.
As observed from the color map (Figure 3b), in the case of NR arrays, an enhancement in the
electromagnetic field intensity occurs in the volume in the vicinity
of the NRs. This increases effectively the volume from which the photogenerated
carriers can be extracted,17 compared to
the case of planar electrode ZnO (50 nm)/CdS (10 nm), indicating the
beneficial optical contribution of the ZnO NR array for the PbS-based
photovoltaic cells.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic diagrams and (b) simulated electric field
intensity
distribution (illumination at 600 nm) for PbS/CdS/FTO (reference),
PbS/CdS/ZnO film/FTO (planar), and PbS/CdS/ZnO-NRA/CdS/PbS (NR-based)
devices.

The FDTD method was further used
to theoretically estimate the
optical absorption in appropriate portion of the AM1.5 G solar spectrum
(i.e., from 300 to 1500 nm) in the PbS layer. The devices shown in Figure 3a were considered
for the simulation. A linearly polarized plane wave that propagates
from outside of the FTO-coated glass substrates to the PbS film through
the electron-accepting electrode assembly was considered to illuminate
the devices. The plots of photon flux Φabs versus
wavelength for the reference, planar, and NR cell structures are shown
in Figure 4. The Φabs was obtained by multiplying the calculated absorbance of
the PbS layer (Figure S2) in the wavelength
region with the corresponding AM1.5 G solar irradiance (Figure S3, taken from ref (30)). The substantial enhancements in the number of photons absorbed
in the entire region are clearly shown in case of the ZnO NR-based
device. In particular, the increment is significant in the region
from 550 to 1200 nm. Although the exact number of carriers generated
due to the increased photon absorption could not be estimated due
to a nonconstant multiplication yield, the improved light absorption
is expected to seriously enhance the efficiency of the devices.30 To validate the observed high current density
for the NR-based devices, we calculated the integrated current density,
which typically defines the upper limit of the obtainable short-circuit
density. From the simulated photon absorption flux given in Figure 4, the integrated
current density is calculated to be 28.3, 31.3, and 43.0 mA/cm2 for the reference, planar, and NR-based devices, respectively.
These values are, as expected, higher than the experimentally obtained
ones owing to various losses in the devices. Nevertheless, the higher
absorbed photon flux generating more excitons in the absorber layer
is likely to be the main contributor to the enhanced PCE value for
the ZnO NR-based devices.

Figure 4 Simulated photon absorption flux (Φabs) in the
PbS layer for the architectures shown in Figure 3a. The flux was calculated by multiplying
the AM1.5 G solar irradiation with and absorption spectra estimated
through the FDTD simulations.

Conclusions
We have reported the highest PCE of about 5.59%
for the noncolloidal
PbS thin film-based solar cells, where a stack of two band-aligned
junctions facilitates absorption of a wider range of the solar spectrum.
The achievement was possible by designing an alternate electron-accepting
electrode assembly consisting of a very thin CdS layer supported by
vertically aligned ZnO NRs prior to the application of double absorption
layers. The highest efficiency corresponds to the enhancement of ∼39%
compared to a reference device that used only a planar electrode in
the form of a 50 nm thick CdS film. Combined with the confirmation
of higher photon absorption in the PbS layer by the 3D-FDTD simulation,
the substantial enhancement in JSC indicates
that the proposed device architecture helps light absorption. This
device architecture of solar cell may suggest an alternative processing
potential for generating competitive low cost cells.

Experimental
Section
The solar cells were prepared on the fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO)-coated
soda lime silicate glass substrate (Pilkinton, U.K.) by solution-based
processes. Three different device architectures were studied in this
work. The reference device has the structure of Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61
eV)/CdS/FTO/glass. The other two devices included ZnO layers, namely
planar (Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61 eV)/CdS/ZnO/FTO/glass) and NR-based
(Al/PbS(0.92 eV)/PbS(1.61 eV)/CdS/ZnO NR/ZnO/FTO/glass). Figure 1a represents the
schematics of the ZnO-based solar cell structures, that is, planar
and NR-based structures. Figures S4 and S5 of the Supporting Information demonstrate the preparation steps
of each structure. As a first step for both structures, ZnO thin films
were deposited using the spin-coating process. The solution for the
ZnO films was prepared in ethanol with 0.5 M zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) and 0.05 M monoethanolamine
(C2H7NO). The deposited films were annealed
at 400 °C for 10 min in air to obtain a 50 nm thick nanocrystalline
ZnO layer. For the growth of ZnO NR, the ZnO film-coated substrates
were vertically placed in another aqueous solution bath containing
0.007 M zinc acetate, and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4) at 95 °C for 3 h. The prepared
samples were rinsed with distilled water and dried with N2 flow. The length and diameter of the NR were ∼200 and ∼45
nm, respectively. Figures S6 and S7 provide
additional information on the effects of three processing parameters,
such as concentrations of Zn acetate in spin-coating solution and
NR growth solution, NR growth time, with regard to the morphology
of NR, and the state of NR arrays.

To fabricate thin-film solar
cells on the ZnO NR substrate, an
aqueous solution containing 0.03 M cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O) and 0.15 M thioacetamide (C2H5NS) was prepared for n-type CdS thin films. The
ZnO NR substrate was vertically immersed into the solution at 25 °C
for 30 min to obtain ∼10 nm thick CdS thin films. Then, PbS
absorber layers were grown onto the CdS/ZnO NR/FTO/glass in an aqueous
solution containing 0.05 M lead nitrate (Pb(NO3)2), 0.04 M triethanolamine (C6H15NO3), 0.2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 0.06 M thiourea (CH4N2S). Double absorber layers were adopted to induce absorption
of a wider range of solar spectrum. According to our previous work,12 stacking of two PbS layers by facing a larger
bandgap layer with the incoming light yielded an enhanced efficiency
by as much as 30% compared to the single layer approach. In the identical
way, here, the samples were first reacted in the PbS precursor solution
at 40 °C for 1 h and then in a different bath containing the
same precursor solution at 80 °C for 3 min. Bandgaps of the PbS
thin films were identified as 1.61 and 0.92 eV, respectively. Total
thickness of the double PbS layers was around 250 nm. After the sequential
deposition of the PbS layers, an Al electrode of thickness of ∼100
nm was deposited by thermal evaporation.

Microstructures were
observed by field emission scanning electron
microscopy (JSM-7001F; JEOL) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, JEM-2100F; JEOL). Optical transmittance and absorbance were
measured by a UV–visible NIR spectrophotometer (UV 3101; Shimadzu).
Structure of the ZnO NRs was analyzed using an X-ray diffractometer
(XRD, Max-2500; Rigaku) under Cu Kα radiation. The depleted
heterojunction solar cells with an active area of 0.09 cm2 were measured by using a current–voltage analyzer (IviumStat;
Ivium Technologies) and a solar simulator (Sun 2000; ABET Technologies)
under an AM1.5 G condition without any mask.
