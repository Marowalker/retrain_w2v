The semiconductor device industry
is constantly challenged by the
demands of miniaturization. Therefore, the use of nanomaterials, such
as quantum dots (QDs), is expected. At these scales, quantum effects
are anticipated under industrial working conditions. Here, we present
a simple fabrication method for integrating colloidal coupled QDs
as components in a vertical device. Characterization of the fundamental
properties of QDs as an ensemble of isolated particles and as layered
QD hybrid structures is demonstrated. For the case of layered QD hybrid
structures, coupling between dots is on average stronger with typical
energy band gaps reduced by more than 200 meV. The shown device offers
a straightforward method to measure and establish a strong coupling
transport system under ambient conditions.

Introduction
The semiconductor devices
industry is constantly challenged to
achieve better control on the nanoscale. Efforts to miniaturize electronic
devices are directed in various directions, such as exploiting new
materials and using self-assembly,1−4 which enables controlling the construction
of solid structures on the atomic scale. At this scale, quantum phenomena
begin to dominate, resulting in changed device behavior. For example,
in closely adjoined semiconductor nanocrystals systems, quantum coupling
must be taken into account.5 Quantum transport
effects have also been shown to occur at room temperature in some
cases.6,7

Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising
materials for realizing
nanoscale semiconductor devices.8−10 QDs are semiconductor nanoparticles
with three-dimensional quantum confinement of charge carriers due
to their small size. As a result, the lower energy levels are discrete,
similar to atoms, and therefore sometimes called “artificial
atoms”. To integrate QDs in electronic devices, great importance
lies in the ability to characterize their band structure, both as
individuals and as aggregates. In previous works, scanning tunneling
spectroscopy has been used to locally measure the single nanocrystal
density of states (DOSs), usually at low temperatures.11 These results are acquired using a complicated
measurement method and produce QD band structures far from the temperature
of industrially operating devices. Moreover, the coupling between
neighboring dots has not been considered.

For densely assembled
QD devices, evaluating the coupling between
QDs is necessary. The coupling reduces the confinement energy12 and decreases the energy band gap.13 Realization of such a system was accomplished
using QD superlattices,14 by encapsulating
QDs in ordered matrices,15 or using molecular
linkers.16−18 This effect can be simplified by considering a double
quantum dot (DQD) model.19 In this model,
charge carrier delocalization and energy-level splitting depend on
the coupling that decays exponentially with the distance between neighboring
QDs. Therefore, a DQD system presents a different DOS.20 In addition, the coupling between a DQD system
and the conductive electrodes may reveal a unique negative differential
resistance (NDR) effect due to destructive interference between the
charge transport pathways through the electrodes.13

The use of self-assembled hybrid organic molecule-QD
device21 opens a simple way to study the
electronic properties
of a QD ensemble under ambient conditions.22 In this work, we study the fundamental feature of coupling in layered
QD hybrid structures linked by organic molecules in between the QDs,
in a vertical device. The coupling properties are explored using multilayers
of linker molecules and QDs organized by chemical adsorption cycles.

Experimental
Methods
Following Vortman et al.,22 a template
device was realized using six layers: (1) a SiO2 substrate;
(2) Au bottom contacts with an adhesion layer of 15 nm Cr; (3) self-assembled
1,9-nonanedithiol organic molecules (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich);
(4) 4.95 ± 0.25 nm diameter CdSe QDs (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich);
(5) 6 nm Al2O3 as an insulating layer for tunneling;
and (6) Au upper contacts. The contacts were fabricated using standard
photolithography. The chemical adsorption cycles of CdSe QDs covalently
bound by the linker molecules were performed using a self-assembly
approach (further details in the Supporting Information). Figure 1a presents
the scheme of the entire device. Figure 1b shows a layer cross section of the measured
device.

Figure 1 (a) Device scheme; the Au lower contacts are represented by the
bottom golden squares. On the same sample, several devices are fabricated
in parallel separated by an insulating layer (represented by the transparent
color). The central rectangles show the micrometric holes in the insulating
layer, enabling the molecules and QD adsorption directly on the Au
contacts. The thin tunnel barrier layer and upper contacts are represented
by the upper bands. (b) Cross section of the hybrid device layers
of the separated micrometric holes. Voltage is applied between the
bottom and top Au contacts, and the current that flows through the
studied hybrid layers is measured.

Similar devices have been previously used to map the ensemble
band
structure of QDs using tunneling measurements.22 Here, we used the same device concept to compare different
hybrid multilayers to explore the coupling properties in layered QD
hybrid structures. Therefore, a first group of samples was immersed
in one adsorption cycle of linker molecules and QDs, whereas a second
group was immersed in two adsorption cycles. A reference sample for
a closed packed assembly without linker molecules was prepared by
simply dropping the QD solution on top of the Au contacts. These samples
were realized using 3.75 ± 0.25 nm diameter CdSe QDs (purchased
from MKnano). Electrical measurements were conducted on the samples
by applying an electrical voltage between the Au contacts and measuring
the current.

We suggest that the consecutive adsorption of the
self-assembled
organic molecules and QDs changes the organization and distances between
the QDs. Different organization will result in different coupling
properties.23 The typical assemblies for
one and two adsorption cycles are sketched in Figure 2: (I) transport through a single monolayer
of QDs and (II and III) transport through covalently coupled QDs,
horizontally or vertically, respectively. One adsorption cycle typically
allows for the creation of structures presented by (I), with no coupling
between the neighboring dots. In some occasions, we may have a different
strength of horizontal coupling. Two adsorption cycles considerably
increase the probability of a strong coupling between the neighboring
QDs due to both increase in density (with no aggregation created)24 and second layer formation. The creation of
two coupled dots in such structures is sketched in Figure 2II,III.

Figure 2 Schematic of the proposed
structures of the hybrid layers. (I)
The QDs are connected to the Au substrate via self-assembled organic
molecules. The QDs can then be uncoupled or coupled horizontally (with
or without linker molecules) or vertically. Use of two adsorption
cycles increases the density and allows for the creation of covalently
coupled structures, such as those shown in (II) and (III).

Results and Discussion
Figure 3 presents
the high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of the QD density
differences between the samples with one and two adsorption cycles.
The QD density increases in the second cycle.

The fabricated devices were characterized using standard
current–voltage
(I–V) measurements in a two-probe
configuration. The voltage was applied between the top and bottom
Au contacts. All the I–V measurements
were taken at room temperature under ambient conditions. Figure 4a displays the representative I–V measurements for the one-cycle
and two-cycle adsorption samples. The current has been normalized
to compare between different measurements. The range of the current
is nanoampere. For ease of interpretation, the derivatives of the I–V curves were taken, as presented
in Figure 4b. In both
cases, a clear NDR signal is measured. The zero-conductance region
presents the QD band gap. All the measurements were taken with the
same threshold of 10% of the 1.9 V current correlates to the optically
measured band gap (see the discussion in paragraphs 12–15).
The most significant error originates from the Fermi distribution
widening at room temperature. The total error is estimated to be around
6% of the measured gap, about 0.1 eV, smaller than the measured differences
between the samples. Peaks appearing at higher energies than the band
gap might be related to the higher energy levels22 and are of no interest for the current discussion. Reference
samples with only molecules display the standard tunneling current,
without the zero-current region (inset of Figure 4a). In addition, The NDR effect does not
appear in the reference measurements without the QDs. The NDR does
appear in all the QDs samples, but changes from sample to sample.

Figure 4 (a) I–V characteristics
of the current through the studied layers. The current has been normalized
to compare between different measurements. The range of current is
nanoampere (one or two adsorption cycles of linker molecules and CdSe
QDs, R ∼ 108 Ω). The zero-conductance
region presents the QD band gap. Inset: Reference samples with only
molecules present standard tunneling current, without the zero-current
region. (b) Derivatives of the I–V curves. The curves are vertically offset for clarity. (c) Histograms
of the measured energy band gaps. Two different energy groups are
demonstrated around 2.2 and 1.7 eV. Error per device is estimated
to be around 6% of the measured gap, about 0.1 eV.

The I–V results show two
typical graphs (blue and red in Figure 4a,b). For the sample with one adsorption cycle (blue),
the graph displays a typical band gap of approximately 2.2 eV. The
sample with two adsorption cycles (red) presents a smaller band gap
of approximately 1.7 eV. This band gap is close to the CdSe bulk band
gap of 1.74 eV at 300 K.25 For ease of
comparison, histograms of the measured band gaps from various samples
are shown in Figure 4c, evaluated from the zero-current regions. These histograms indicate
two different energy groups. The first possesses band gaps of approximately
2.2 eV, whereas the second group displays smaller band gaps in the
range of 1.7 eV. As shown in the histograms, the samples with one
adsorption cycle exhibit energy band gaps from the two groups. The
samples with two adsorption cycles present energy band gaps mainly
from the “smaller band gap” group.

Figure 5a compares
the optical absorption spectra of colloidal, isolated CdSe QDs in
the solution to the same linked QDs. The samples for the optical measurements
were prepared using a layer-by-layer method26,27 to assemble the QDs covalently bound by 1,9-nonanedithiol linker
molecules. In these samples, more than two layers were adsorbed to
achieve sufficient signal,28 and only absorption
measurements are presented, as the photoluminescence (PL) signal is
too weak. We attribute the small PL to the coupling between QDs and
the disorder that increases the nonradiative loses, which causes a
shorter radiative lifetime.29 Small widening
and a redshift of the band gap with a broad low energy tail extending
to ∼1.7 eV are observed in the linked QDs, in agreement to
previous studies.5,30 This tail can serve as an evidence
for the strong coupling between the QDs in the sample, which causes
the delocalization of excitons to the neighboring dots.31 It should be mentioned that light scattering
from the samples is a possible contributor to the observed features.
Previous work on this system showed that such a scattering mechanism
is not the only cause for the low-energy tail.31

Figure 5 (a) Absorption spectra of the layered CdSe QDs linked with organic
molecules compared to the same isolated QDs in a solution. (Solution:
abs. peak: 2.1 eV, half width at half maximum (HWHM): 0.06 eV; 10
layers: abs. peak: 2.08 eV, HWHM: 0.07 eV). The band gap peak of the
layered QD hybrid structure is wider and possesses a broad low-energy
tail extending to ∼1.7 eV. (b) Isolated CdSe QD (solution)
PL (PL peak: 2.04 eV, full width at half-maximum (FWHM): 0.12 eV)
compared to the absorption results (abs. peak: 2.07 eV, HWHM: 0.06
eV).

To relate the zero-conductance
gap in the tunneling spectrum (also
called the quasiparticle gap), Egaptun, to the optical band gap, Egapopt, we must consider the electron–hole Coulomb attraction energy32  Based on the electrostatic charging energy
for a QD embedded in a homogeneous dielectric medium with an effective
dielectric constant, ϵout,33,3433,34 the attraction energy can be estimated by35  For the CdSe QDs used in this study,
the dielectric
constant of the QDs, ϵin, is 8,36 and ϵout is treated as a free parameter.
For QDs with a diameter of 5 nm with ϵout = 2.1,
this theoretical calculation predicts a value of Je–h = 0.3 eV, which is in good agreement with the
observed values of Je–h (D = 5 nm) ∼ 0.2 eV (combining scanning tunneling
spectroscopy and optical measurements).36

Accordingly, we can extract the band gap of the tunneling
spectra
and compare this value with the optical band gap of the isolated CdSe
QDs in the solution. The band gap is 2.04 eV, as measured by PL in Figure 5b (green line). The
absorption peak is shifted because of the Stokes shift.  This energy value matches the band gap of
the first group, corresponding to the sample with one adsorption cycle,
at approximately 2.2 eV. From this result, we can conclude that this
band gap corresponds to the tunneling through isolated QDs. The second
group of band gaps, at approximately 1.7 eV, corresponds to a dramatic
reduction in the band gap. This observation may be attributed to pronounced
interdot interactions present in the case of two adsorption cycles.
Such interactions, associated with (at least partial) electronic delocalization
over two (or more) QDs would indeed lead to a redshift in the optical
band gap (as observed in Figure 5a, with a tail stretching up to 1.7 eV). Moreover,
the Coulomb attraction correction (Je–h) should decrease in magnitude for delocalized electron and hole
states.

In transport I–V measurements
through several channels, the higher current dominates the results.
Therefore, the transport measurements of a distribution of band gaps
will be mainly sensitive to the smaller energy band gap. For voltages
above the lower channel gap, current will flow, and resistance will
be nonzero. At higher voltages, additional channels will open, and
the current will rise faster. In this case, unlike the absorption
measurements, our device is mostly sensitive to the red tail of the
spectra. We also believe that, due to the nonhomogeneous Al2O3 barrier, the current will mostly flow through the highest
assembly of QDs, which also suggests that we mainly explored the highest-possible
QD coupling in the device.

According to this description, we
suggest that, in the samples
with only one adsorption cycle, the band gaps of an ensemble of isolated
QDs are primarily measured, with a band gap matching the size distribution
of the dots.22 As stated, the two adsorption
cycles allow additional coupled structures (Figure 2). Thus, we attribute the smaller band gaps
in the histogram of the samples with two adsorption cycles to tunneling
through layered coupled QD. Note that in the samples with one adsorption
cycle, a small band gap and NDR also appear in some cases. We attribute
these features to the asymmetric horizontally coupled QD structures
(Figure 2I). In all
the structures, the top electrode is coupled to the system through
an Al2O3 tunnel barrier, whereas the bottom
electrode is more strongly coupled to the dots via the organic linkers.
This asymmetry was predicted to cause a NDR effect.13 The QD distribution ensures different dot sizes upon the
coupling of two adjacent QDs. Both the NDR and the band gap in the
simple studied device are clearly sensitive to changes in the coupling
of the assembled structure.

Finally, to compare the results
of the adsorbed layers to the isolated
QD system, we prepared the samples by dropping the 3.75 ± 0.25
nm diameter CdSe QD solution on the sample with only the spacer ligands
of the QDs and no linker molecules. The typical ligands of the QDs
(octadecyl amine, for the MKnano particles; trioctylphosphine oxide,
for the Sigma-Aldrich particles) are long and introduce large distances
between the QDs.37 Without the ligand exchange,
no coupled structures are expected due to the spatial separation and
lack of covalent bonds. Indeed, the I–V characteristic of those measurements (presented in Figure 6b) exhibit large
zero-current gaps of 2.4 eV. These values correspond to isolated CdSe
QDs in a solution, as optically measured and presented in Figure 6a (green line) via
the Coulomb attraction Je–h (D = 4 nm) ∼ 0.3 eV.36 The
measured resistance of these samples was relatively large, of the
order of R ∼ 1011 Ω, due
the higher insulation of the samples. The histogram presents (Figure 6c) a wide distribution
of gaps with respect to the different possible current channels.

Figure 6 (a) Isolated
3.75 ± 0.25 nm CdSe QD (solution) photoluminescence
results (PL peak: 2.12 eV, FWHM: 0.1 eV) and absorption results (abs.
peak: 2.16 eV, HWHM: 0.06 eV). (b) I–V characteristics and derivative (inset) of the current
that flows through the studied CdSe QD layer using adsorption by dropping
the QDs on the sample without ligand exchange (R ∼
1011 Ω). (c) Histogram of the measured energy band
gaps, demonstrating a wide distribution.

From an estimation of the coupling energy due to the band
gap changes,
we achieve energies larger than 200 meV, i.e., confirming the presence
of a strong coupling regime. This energy value is greater than the
optically measured energy of approximately ∼100 meV.5 We attribute the strong coupling to the ligand
exchange, which enables the formation of covalent bonds. In addition,
as previously stated, we mainly explored the highest-possible QD coupling
in the device. In a tight package configuration with our QDs and ligands,
taking the nearest neighbors’ delocalization of the wavefunction
(15 nm delocalization) is enough to create such a shift in the energy.
Therefore, the appropriate comparison relates to the low-energy absorption
tail more than to the redshifted energy peak. Moreover, this value
is closer to the larger reductions in the band gaps of QDs in the
arrays. In some cases, the energy decreases of up to ∼400 meV12,38 were detected in the tunneling spectra. The NDR also indicates the
presence of the strong coupling regime.

Conclusions
We
presented a simple fabrication method for integrating colloidal
coupled QDs as components in a vertical device. Characterization of
the fundamental properties of the QDs as an ensemble of isolated particles
and as layered QD hybrid structures was demonstrated. The double dipped
samples presented typical smaller energy band gaps by more than 200
meV compared to the samples with one adsorption cycle. These results
indicate the strong coupling between dots in most double dipped samples.
The device presents a straightforward method to establish and measure
the strong coupling in a layered QD hybrid system.
