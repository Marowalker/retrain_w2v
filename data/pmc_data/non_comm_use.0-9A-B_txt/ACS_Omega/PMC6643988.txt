The
surface relief structure of polymer films over large areas
can be controlled by combining nanoscale imprinting and microscale
ultraviolet–ozone (UVO) radiation, resulting in hierarchical
structured surfaces. First, nanoscale patterns were formed by nanoimprinting
elastomer [poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)] films with a pattern on
a digital video disk. Micron-scale patterns were then superimposed
on the nanoimprinted PDMS films by exposing them to ultraviolet radiation
in oxygen (UVO) through a transmission electron microscopy grid mask
having variable microscale patterning. UVO exposure leads to conversion
and densification of PDMS to SiOx, leading
to micron height relief features that follow a linear scaling relation
with pattern dimension. Further, the pattern scopes are shown to collapse
into a master curve by normalized feature values. Interestingly, these
relief structures preserve the nanoscale features. In this paper,
the influence of the self-limiting PDMS densification, wall stress
at the boundary of micro-depression, and UVO exposure energy is studied
in control of the micro-depression scale. This simple two-step imprinting
process involving both nanoimprinting and UV radiation allows for
facile fabrication of the dimension adjustable micro–nano hierarchically
structures not only on elastomer films but also on thermoplastic polymer
films. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations were performed
to correlate the surface tension and elastic properties of polymeric
materials to the deformation of the pattern structure.

Introduction
Hierarchical structures
are ubiquitous in nature, ranging from
the surface structure of taro and other plants to the feathers of
birds and the foot-hairs of geckos.1−3 These highly organized
materials often have specific functional properties that derive from
their multiscale structures, for example, superhydrophobicity, self-cleaning,
water resistance, transport for membranes, and the capacity to sustain
high loading forces.4−6 Traditional methods used to fabricate hierarchical
structures typically involve the formation of larger features and
smaller roughness in steps by lithography,7−10 which includes photolithography,
electron-beam lithography, and ultraviolet (UV) photolithography for
making complex patterns.11,12 These methods require
expensive equipments and specialty reagents; therefore, the low-cost
fabrication of well-controlled hierarchical patterns for diverse potential
applications remains a challenge.

Soft lithography methods have
attracted much attention in fabricating
hierarchical micro- and nano-scale structures. In our approach to
the fabrication of hierarchical film patterns with a large depth relief
over large areas, we have combined soft imprint lithography12 with an ultraviolet–ozone (UVO) exposure
step.13 In this method, nanoscale digital
video disk (DVD) patterns are initially transferred onto an elastomeric
substrate [poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)] through direct nanoimprinting,
whereas in-plane and out-of-plane microscale structuring of the films
were created by simply UVO irradiating the film through transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) grids with different hole configurations.
The mechanism of how the wall stress built up at the boundary region
of micro-recession is systematically studied. In-depth understanding
of the process of micro-recession was attained by elucidating the
influence of the frontal development (top-down-reduced PDMS densification)
of PDMS under UVO irradiation. Such micro–nano hierarchically
patterned PDMS can be utilized for pattern transfer to other thermoplastic
materials. In order to probe the fidelity and controllability of the
nanopattern preparation and imprinting, we performed a coarse-grained
molecular dynamics simulation and established the universality of
the pattern deformation as a function of the material properties.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
of PDMS under UVO
PDMS can be oxidized under
UVO radiation with two dominant wavelengths: 185 and 254 nm. Mechanically,
oxygen in the atmosphere is activated by the 185 nm UV light producing
ozone, and the −CH3 groups in the PDMS side chain
are eliminated by the reaction with ozone under 254 nm UV.14 In particular, the operative reactions and rationale
for this reaction are shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Chemistry of PDMS under UVO
In our experiments, flat PDMS was exposed to UVO radiation
with
wavelengths of 185 and 254 nm with an uncoated TEM copper grid as
the photomask upon it. Only the regions not shielded by the wire and
grid were exposed to radiation. To understand the two different chemistries
of the photomasked PDMS at UVO exposed and blocked parts, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed. A VersaProbe II Scanning XPS Microprobe
from Physical Electronics (PHI), under ultrahigh vacuum conditions,
with a pressure of 2 × 10–6 Pa was used for
XPS spectra. Automated dual beam charge neutralization was used during
the analysis of the samples to provide accurate data. The energy-passed
analyzer was 117.4 eV for the survey spectra and 23.5 eV for the high-resolution
Si 2p scans. Each spectrum was collected using a monochromatic (Al
Kα) X-ray beam (E = 1486.6 eV) over a 200 μm
diameter probing area with a beam power of 50 W. Figure 1A shows the color image of
C 1s intensity, indicating the distribution of carbon ratio at the
40 min UVO-exposed PDMS surface (∼10 nm depth) with a 100 mesh
TEM grid (230 μm side width) as a photomask. The higher carbon
density is observed at UVO blocked regions with the white translucent
lines as auxiliary lines. The details of the atomic ratios at UVO
exposed and blocked PDMS surfaces are presented in Table 1. After 40 min UVO exposure,
the carbon ratio decreased from the original 43.1%, which is close
to the theoretical value of 50%, to 19.1% because of the chemistry
of PDMS under UVO inducing evaporable carbon dioxide. Additionally,
the ratio of Si to O increased to 1:2 approximately, which corresponds
to the expectation of the transformation from PDMS to SiO2 as discussed above. The Si 2p peaks in Figure 1B display a binding energy shift from the
UVO blocked region to UVO exposed region. The Si 2p peak shift, from
102.27 to 102.84 eV, confirms the transition tendency, as the literature
value of SiO2 is 103.3–103.7 eV.15,16

Si 2p level at UVO exposed and blocked PDMS surfaces.

Table 1 Atomic Concentration (C 1s, O 1s,
and Si 2p) Determined by XPS of Untreated PDMS (Theoretical and Measured)
and 40 min UVO-Exposed PDMS
 	C (%)	O (%)	Si (%)	
PDMS (theoretical)	50.0	25.0	25.0	
PDMS (measured)	43.1	31.9	25.0	
PDMS (exposed for 40 min)	19.1	54.3	26.1	
In addition
to the PDMS chemistry change before and after UVO exposure,
the transition from O–Si–C (density is 0.965 g/cm3) to SiOx (density is 2.64 g/cm3 for x = 2) results in a large density increase,
contributing to the depth increase of PDMS under UVO exposure.14 Thus, PDMS behaves like a traditional dry positive
photoresist in this UVO densification method.14,17 The change of density of the polymer upon radiation is not the only
factor relevant to creating surface topography under illumination.
Changes in the local chemical composition associated with nonuniform
UVO exposure will cause the change of surface energy of the film which
eventually leads to variations in surface topography.18−21 Previous studies show that the migration of low-molecular-weight
species of PDMS from bulk to the surface causes the recovery of surface
energy and surface hydrophobicity.22 In
our experiments, no obvious surface depth recovery is observed, as
determined by measurements of the structure after 3 weeks (unchanged).
A combination of densification and interfacial energy variation is
then responsible for the UVO-induced surface modification. We next
quantify this patterning process to exert dimensional control over
the surface pattern process.

PDMS Micropattern Analysis
Figure 2 shows nanoscopic
and microscopic patterns
formed simultaneously at the film surface. Figure 2A shows AFM images of a DVD nanopattern transferred
onto the PDMS film by replica molding with the inset of the original
polycarbonate DVD pattern. The process of PDMS nanopattern fabrication
is shown in the Experimental Section. Mukherjee
et al.23−26 have done pioneering work on imprinting channel structures from
DVD in soft elastomer layers and embedded aluminum layer, along with
novel nanopatterning studies by Soles et al.,27−29 Jones et al.,28,29 and Ding et al.27 The height of the PDMS
replica of the DVD template is discussed in detail in the simulation
part. Evidently, we obtain a faithful pattern reproduction. The replication
of the CD polycarbonate pattern is shown in the Supporting Information. Figure 2B shows a range of PDMS topographies created by simply
varying the UVO photomask pattern size with the constant of 4 h UVO
exposure (accumulated energy: 85.3 J/cm2). Three kinds
of TEM grids: G300HEX, G1000, and G2000, with different shapes and
sizes were utilized. The detailed shape and dimension information
can be found in Figure S9. The resulted
PDMS surface structures have similar widths of (56.1 ± 2.4),
(18.5 ± 1.9), and (7.5 ± 0.1) μm, respectively. The
average pattern depths (D) of these three micropatterns
are 1165, 600, and 355 nm, respectively. The left plot in Figure 2C shows, interestingly,
a linear scaling relationship that exists between the PDMS depression
depth (D) and pattern width (W), D = (15.8W + 244) nm, where the depth (D) is calculated from the differential of the deepest part
to the top surface of the UVO-blocked part, and the width (W) is the micro-depression width in micrometers. Error bars
are the standard deviation of repeated measurements. Although the
depth of the depression created by UVO patterning is nearly linear
over the range of our observations, the Y-intercept
(244 nm) of this extrapolated line would not be zero, implying that
this micropattern scaling must break down at submicron pattern length
scales, as shown by black dashed line extrapolated to zero in Figure 2C, left side. Detailed
analysis of that regime is out of the scope of our present study however.
At the other extreme of “non-confinement”, we placed
a smooth silicon wafer on a smooth PDMS pad to create a semi-infinite
boundary. Although this will be discussed in detail later, the edge
height across this single step-boundary gave a UVO exposure saturation
depth of 1150 nm. We then extrapolate pattern width of Figure 2C (left) to this maximum saturation
depth and determine that it would correspond to a micropattern width
of 57.3 μm. It means that PDMS sculpted through micropattern
mask widths above 57.3 μm (about G300HEX mesh size) should then
be free of finite size effects, that is, the linear scaling relation
will no longer apply.

DVD pattern by replica molding and (B) AFM images of flat PDMS irradiated
under UVO for 4 h through a TEM grid with different patterns: (from
left to right) 300 HEX mesh, 57 μm side; 1000 square mesh,
19 μm side; and 2000 square mesh, 7.5 μm side.
(C) UVO unnormalized micropattern depth of the UVO micropatterning
as a function of in-plane dimension. (D) Normalized micropattern depth
of the UVO micropatterning (from top surface to center of pattern).

An examination of the shape of
these depressions offers further
evidence relating to the physical origin of this pattern formation:
a balance of elastic wall restoring forces and the pinned densified
glassy base layer. If the shapes of the pattern depressions with given
symmetry are rather independent of the TEM grid pattern dimensions,
we deduce that the balance of elastic energy and pinning force between
the UVO-densified base layer and non-UVO-exposed wall regions is dominating
the pattern replication. We quantify this superficial impression in
normalized plots to compare PDMS trench depth profile shapes. As a
function of reduced dimensions, we scale our AFM observations of the
pattern depth (Z) normalized by the maximum depth
of the pattern (Zmax) and the in-plane
coordinate of the pattern width W normalized by the
grid pattern width (Wpattern). The right
plot in Figure 2D shows
that the shapes of all the cavities are indeed rather similar, except
near the edges of these patterns. We see that the edge “irregularities”
in the UVO micro-depression patterns extend beyond the edge of the
TEM mask and they become progressively smaller on a relative height
scale as the mask patterns become larger. This secondary patterning
at the edge of the pattern probably reflects the backflow of material
associated with the formation of the micro-depression pattern upon
UV exposure, but this effect must be convoluted with the scattering
of UV light under the mask near the edges of the exposed regions.

PDMS Micro–Nano Hierarchical Pattern Analysis
Figure 3 shows the
results of the combined micro–nano hierarchical patterning
process in PDMS (cured directly on the DVD pattern and then UVO exposed
under the TEM grid). The left column of Figure 3 shows hierarchical PDMS patterns obtained
after 4 h (accumulated energy: 85.3 J/cm2) of UVO exposure
through the same three TEM grids (as shown in Figure S9) after a common DVD nanopatterning step. The right
column is the negative replica of the pattern on the left, obtained
by direct molding. Figure 3G (left) shows the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the AFM
image of the hierarchical pattern from the G2000 TEM grid (side width:
7.5 μm). Figure 3H (left) is the FFT of the negative replica of Figure 3G (left). The planar orderings of the hierarchical
patterns are clearly reflected in these FFT spectra of the AFM images.
The obvious higher ordered peaks indicate the pronounced channel orientation.
The in-plane average channel distance of 757 nm (very close to channel
wavelength obtained from AFM: 750 nm) was derived from the FFT in Figure 3G (right), which
also revealed the long-range uniformity of the channel exceed by far
the investigated area. The macro square patterns are arranged with
high periodicity in both horizontal and vertical directions, according
to the parallel dot matrices. According to Figure 3G (right: line profile of the hierarchical
pattern units generated from the G2000 TEM grid) and Figure 3H [right: line profile from
the negative imprinted pattern of Figure 3G (right)], we observe that the UVO-exposed
regions become depressed by several hundred nanometers; yet quite
surprisingly, the nanostructures created through the initial DVD patterning
survive the deep UVO exposure densification process. Comparing to
the original nano-channel height (120 nm), shrinkages are observed,
as illustrated in curves c (showing the nano-height in exposed regions)
and d (showing the nano-height at replica of c) in Figure 3J, where we see that the PDMS
nanoscale channel height is smaller in exposed regions (c) than the
shielded regions (e in Figure 3K) of the TEM grid. The replica of hierarchically patterned
PDMS has a higher micropattern height but a smaller nanopatterned
height as compared to the original hierarchically patterned PDMS,
as shown in Figure 3I,J. Likewise, the UVO blocked nanopattern region in the original
hierarchical pattern is higher compared to that in the hierarchical
replica in Figure 3K.

Figure 3 Left column shows AFM images of hierarchical PDMS pattern combining
DVD with TEM grid patterns (300 hexagonal grid mesh, 1000 grid mesh,
and 2000 grid mesh) after 4 h (85.3 J/cm2) UVO exposure.
The right column shows the negative imprint of left column PDMS patterns.
Insets are the structures with high resolution, with dimensions of
20 μm × 20 μm, 10 μm × 10 μm, and
20 μm × 20 μm, from top to bottom. The (G) (left)
and (H) (left) show the FFT of the AFM images with a hierarchical
pattern combining 2000 grid mesh (side width: 7.5 μm) and DVD
channel patterns at both of direct imprinting and replica molding
conditions, respectively. The (G) (right) and (H) (right) show the
line profiles of two micron-scale repeating units corresponding to
the 2000 grid mesh imprinting case at both of direct imprinting and
replica conditions. The (I,J,H) three plots show the height changes
of micropattern, UVO blocked and unblocked nanopatterns at mold and
replica (a–f, marked in AFM images accordingly), respectively.
The data are calculated from AFM images of 300 hexagonal mesh grid/DVD
hierarchical patterns. Uncertainties in plots indicate the standard
deviations in repeated measurements.

We believe that the reason for the height of the micropattern
at
the replica of the hierarchical pattern being slightly larger than
the original micro-depression is the vertical thermal expansion of
the non-densified UVO blocked walls of the mold pattern, at the elevated
temperature during the curing of the replica PDMS fluid. This decreased
relief pattern height trend in the nano-channel pattern replication
is opposite to the increased micropattern amplitude replication, both
outside and inside UVO exposed regions, simply because of PDMS contraction
associated with cooling.

We next consider the influence of cumulative
UVO exposure on DVD
nanopatterned PDMS to further explore the extent to which the micro-topography
can be controlled. The red and black curves in Figure 4A indicate the depths of the
UVO exposed PDMS regions with a G1000 TEM grid as photomasks, as a
function of UVO energy. The main feature of Figure 4A is the nonmonotonic change of micropattern
depth with UVO exposure. We conjecture that the depth increases initially
because of the formation of a dense silica layer at the PDMS surface
after a long-term UVO exposure that reduces the diffusion of oxygen
through the PDMS layer and blocks the direct UV exposure, preventing
the further in-depth densification. In parallel, but on a much slower
time scale, there occurs densification at the direct UV blocked walls
of PDMS because of the scattered UV irradiation and ozone diffusion
below the rough TEM grid surface. Another reason of this progressively
reduced wall height is probably the insufficient vertical wall stress
against the dragging down force from the densified glass layer as
the PDMS surface declined to some extent. Figure 4A also plots the depth of the micropattern
replica. Its height is slightly higher than the mold because of the
same reason discussed in Figure 3I, which is the surface roughness difference of the
TEM grids, that is, one side is smoother (shiny surface) than the
other side (matte surface). Figures 1–4A are collected with
the rougher “matte” side of the TEM grid in contact
with the nanopatterned PDMS. In contrast, the UVO imprinting was conducted
by reversibly applying the smooth side of the TEM grid for micropattern
generation (red and blue curves in Figure 4B). We observe that the stable equilibrium
micropattern heights are obtained even with long-term UVO exposure,
which indicates that the effect of wall stress is largely prevented.
Here, the blue and red curves show the results from a flat PDMS film
covered by the smooth side of the 19 μm square TEM grid (G1000)
and a DVD nanopatterned PDMS also covered by the smooth side of the
G1000 TEM grid. For both DVD nanopatterned and smooth surface, a limiting
micropattern saturation depth of nearly 500–700 nm is attained.
While, the increased rough contact between TEM grid and DVD-patterned
PDMS accelerates the PDMS surface densification at TEM grid covered
parts. As a control, we placed a smooth silicon surface cleaved along
the 100 plane, in contact with a smooth PDMS pad, and exposed it to
UVO. The depth evolution in the PDMS UVO exposed region (measured
at the boundary as a step height) is plotted in the black solid line
in Figure 4B. It increases
gradually and saturates at a depth of 1150 nm, nearly twice the depth
attained under the smooth contacting surface of a G1000 TEM grid.
We attribute this depth difference to the finite size effects of the
micro-square pattern (discussed in Figure 2C). The final depth of 1150 nm represents
a balance between the retracting UVO densified region stresses and
restoring wall stresses. We conducted further studies to determine
the effect of PDMS thickness on surface densification. The black dashed
line in Figure 4B is
measured on a PDMS layer of thickness (3.89 ± 0.116) mm, nearly
three times as the previous PDMS thickness used in this study. Comparing
to the black solid line in Figure 4B on PDMS of thickness (1.22 ± 0.031) mm, the
surface depression of the thicker PDMS is about 200 nm deeper at large
UVO dose, but much less than three times of the 1.22 mm PDMS depth.
This nonlinear dependence on PDMS thickness phenomena is presumably
due to a gradual diminishment of PDMS densification from the surface
to bulk interior as the surface glassy layer works as a natural barrier
to UV and ozone permeation. Thus, the surface indent depth of PDMS
after UVO exposure is not in direct proportion to its bulk thickness.

Figure 4 (A) Depth/aspect
ratio changes with UVO exposure time/cumulative
radiation energy in the case of a rough TEM grid (1000 mesh, 19 μm).
(B) Plot of the depth/aspect ratio changes with UVO exposure time/cumulative
radiation energy. The black-solid and black-dashed curves are measured
on PDMS samples, half-blocked by a flat silicon wafer, for PDMS of
thickness (1.22 ± 0.031) and (3.89 ± 0.116) mm, respectively.
The blue curve is the depth measured from flat PDMS covered by a 19
μm mesh photomask. The red curve is measured from DVD-patterned
PDMS covered by a 19 μm photomask. The graph shows a nonmonotonic
PDMS micropattern depth change with increasing UVO exposure time:
0.5 h (UVO energy: 10.7 J/cm2), 1 h (21.4 J/cm2), 2 h (42.7 J/cm2), 3 h (64.0 J/cm2), 5 h
(106.6 J/cm2), 7 h (149.2 J/cm2), and 9 h (191.8
J/cm2) corresponding to data points in curves. Error bars
in (A,B) are estimated from the standard deviation of repeated measurements.
(C) PDMS depth changes with different UVO exposures at 0.5 h (red
columns) and 5 h (black columns) upon PDMS with Young’s modulus
of 0.57 MPa.

Young’s modulus
measured at a ratio of 20:1 (PDMS base vs
curing agent) is about 0.6 MPa, which is very close to the values
reported in other literatures.30−32 The 18 h (Young’s modulus:
0.57 MPa) cured PDMS with 20:1 mixing ratio was utilized to study
the effect of PDMS thickness on the UVO densification efficiency. Figure 4C shows the surface
height reduction of PDMS, which is measured from PDMS half-blocked
by the silicon wafer under 0.5 h (10.7 J/cm2) and 5 h (106.6
J/cm2) UVO exposure. The red and black columns represent
the PDMS surface decrease at UVO exposure time intervals of 0.5 and
5 h, respectively. We observe the same trends between surface depth
and PDMS thickness: larger the PDMS thickness, larger the surface
depth under both exposure conditions. The effect of PDMS thickness
shown in Figure 4C
leads to the same conclusion, as discussed in Figure 4B.

It is important to point out that
patterns with larger mesh sizes
can be generated by this technique, so there is no issue with the
in-plane scalability of dimensions. This is illustrated in Figure S9, which shows the digital photographs
of the hierarchical patterns with the combination of DVD nanopattern
and micro-square grid patterns with side lengths of 500 and 250 μm,
respectively, (USA standard testing sieve from VWR, USA) after 4 h
UVO exposure. AFM scans of these larger patterns (not shown) revealed
that because of the “weaving” of the wire mesh at the
intersections of the sieve, the boundaries of square patterns are
not sharp. The multicolor surface is due to the nature of light interference
from DVD patterns.

Regardless of these complications relating
to surface roughness
of the photomask, we can fabricate hierarchical patterns of tunable
depth within the 1 μm range or larger by varying the mask pattern
dimension, UVO exposure time (dose), and PDMS thickness.

Hierarchical
Pattern Replication in Thermoplastics
We also show that our
hierarchical patterning approach can be extended
to thermoplastic polymers where other physical mechanisms underlie
interfacial energy change with patterning.19−21 Capillary force
lithography33−35 allows us to accomplish this transfer process. The
detailed process for imprinting is shown in the Experimental
Section. Figure 5A,B illustrates the formation of hierarchical polystyrene (PS) replica
patterns with different TEM grid geometries. The line profile in Figure 5C quantitatively
shows the surface profile of a hierarchical pattern that we obtained
by this method. The line profile of these structures is quite similar
to the hierarchical PDMS patterns. We thus expect this method of patterning
to be general and versatile, which can be applied to most thermoplastic
polymers such as polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(vinyl
chloride), and so forth.

the blue line in (B).

Simulations of Confined Patterning
In order to elucidate
how surface tension and elastic properties of polymeric materials
used in the nanopattern fabrication process influence the deformation
of the pattern structure, we perform coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations of the fabrication process following main steps outlined
in Figure S9 as described in details in the Supporting Information. In our simulations, we use bead-spring representation
of the precursor polymers and cross-linked polymeric films. The surface
of the rigid mold structure (DVD or CD pattern) is modeled by the
fixed beads. The pattern has a periodic structure of bars with square
cross section of side length H0 and distance
between bars Lx. The
interactions between beads are described by the Lennard-Jones (LJ)
potential, and chemical bonds are modeled by the FENE potential (see
the Supporting Information for simulation
details). In our simulations, all beads have diameter σ. The
transferred pattern into the polymeric film is fixed either by cross-linking
polymeric chains making up the film (analog of the PDMS replica) or
by a temperature quench (analog of the PS replica). To establish relationships
between the parameters of the interaction potentials and macroscopic
system properties such as surface tension and shear modulus, we perform
a set of additional molecular dynamics simulations in which we calculate
the shear modulus GN of the polymeric
network and its surface tension as a function of the cross-linking
density and strength of the LJ interaction parameters describing affinity
between different species making up the system.

Figure 6 shows simulation results for
deformation of the transferred replica fixed by cross-linking polymeric
film for patterns with different cross-sectional sizes H0 and different shear moduli GN of the negative mold. It follows from this figure that as the shear
modulus of the negative mold increasing, the deformation decreases
monotonically for all sizes. It is interesting to point out that compared
with the square shape of the master mold, smaller pattern size shows
a larger relative deformation.

Figure 6 Evolution of the replica shape produced
via cross-linking (blue
color) compared with the corresponding master mold shape (yellow color)
as a function of master mold size H0 and
shear modulus GN of the negative mold
network.

The observed deformation of the
transferred pattern can be shown
to be a manifestation of the balance elastic and capillary forces.36−57 The elastic force per unit area generated in the cross-linked polymeric
film due to pattern height displacement by ΔH can be estimated as GNΔH. This force is balanced by the surface tension γ
of the network–air interface. This results in the following
scaling relation of the pattern height deformation and ratio of the
elastocapillary number γ/GNH0: ΔH/H0 ∝ γ/GNH0. In Figure 7, we combine all our simulation data for
pattern deformation as a function of the dimensionless parameter Cγ/GNH0, where the numerical coefficient C ≈ 1 for our simulations. All our data sets have collapsed
into one universal plot. In the regime of the small values of the
parameter γ/GNH0 < 1 when the network elasticity provides a dominant
contribution stabilizing the pattern deformation, the pattern deformation
increases linearly with increasing values of the dimensionless parameter
γ/GNH0. However, in the opposite limit of large values when γ/GNH0 > 1, the
structure
of the transferred pattern is completely destroyed. This pattern smoothing
is a result of capillary forces that minimize the surface area of
the network–air interface by flattening it.

Figure 7 Dependence of the deformation
ratio ΔH/H0 on
the elastocapillary number for different
systems: the negative mold (black solid square), melt with the negative
mold of system 1 (red empty square), melt with the negative mold of
system 2 (green half solid square). Experimental data from Table 2 are shown by pink
stars. The inset shows definitions of pattern deformation in studied
systems.

To compare our simulation data
with experiments, Figure 7 also shows the dependence
of pattern deformation of the negative mold at different cross-linking
densities (see the experimental measurement in Table 2). By fitting the experimental results to the function, ΔH = H0 – H = Cγ/GN, and considering numerical constant C and H0 as fitting parameters, we obtain for numerical
constant C = 0.25 ± 0.02 and for the relaxed
pattern height corresponding to the case of zero surface tension to
be equal to H0 = 145.4 ± 2.6 nm.
For the PDMS surface tension, we use value γ = 22.7 mN/m.58

Height for the Negative Mold with Different PDMS Base Cross-Linker
Weight Ratios for Samples Cured at 120 °C for 2 h
PDMS base/cross-linker ratio	10:1	15:1	20:1	
Young’s modulus (MPa)	1.74 ± 0.03	0.70 ± 0.05	0.29 ± 0.04	
pattern height (nm)	137 ± 3	119 ± 1	87 ± 7	
Note that capillary forces also play an important role in controlling
the fidelity of the pattern fixed by the temperature quench. In this
case, the deformation of the interface between the soft mold image
and precursor polymeric film controls the quality of the transferred
pattern. By quenching the system, we are fixing the location of the
interface and pattern deformation (see the Supporting Information for details).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have shown the fabrication of dual-scale micro–nano
hierarchical interfacial patterns in elastomer and thermoplastic polymer
films by combining nanoimprinting and UVO microlithography. Using
this approach, tunable and scalable hierarchically patterned structures
in glassy polymers can be generated with different PDMS nanopattern
masters, UVO irradiation, and micropatterned photomasks. The presented
systematic study of the effects of the wall stress, frontal development
(gradual diminishment of PDMS densification from surface to bulk interior
under UVO exposure), UVO exposure energy, and PDMS modulus provided
valuable information for optimization of the pattern transfer technique.
Comparison of computer simulations and experimental results for pattern
deformation pinpoints the elastocapillarity as a driving force behind
pattern deformation at different stages of the pattern transfer process.
The future development of this technique could become a valuable tool
for micro-contact imprinting with potential applications in the fabrication
of microfludic devices, biologically active substrates, and electronic
systems.

Experimental Section
Nanopatterning
DVDs with 155 nm
height and 750 nm wavelength
patterns were obtained from Sony Corp., Japan. To prepare DVD-patterned
PDMS, the surface polycarbonate layer and metallic reflecting layer
in DVD were removed and then rinsed with methanol. PDMS (Sylgard 182,
Dow Corning) was prepared by hand mixing base and curing agent with
a weight ratio of 10:1. Air bubbles trapped in the mixture were removed
by exhausting in vacuum desiccators for 15 min. Then, the PDMS liquid
mix was poured onto the DVD master, followed by curing at 120 °C
for 2 h in an oven. The patterned PDMS was obtained by peeling off
from the DVD master. Fabrication of elastomeric CD patterns was produced
in the same way.

Micropatterning
Micropatterns were
produced on DVD
nanopatterned PDMS, as well as on PDMS pads with smooth surfaces cured
from glass plates. This was accomplished by placing TEM grids on PDMS
surfaces. The TEM grids used in these experiments have square and
hexagonal features with different hole widths and grid widths. The
detailed information of dimension is found in Figure S9. Subsequently, these were placed in a UVO chamber
(PSD series, Novascan Technologies, Inc.) and exposed to the simultaneous
dual ultraviolet wavelengths of 185 and 254 nm. Micropatterns were
generated via consequent “sinking” of regions exposing
to the UVO. The average thickness of PDMS used in this study is 1.22
mm, with a standard deviation of 0.031 mm. The standard deviations
in this article are all calculated from repeated measurements. The
digital images of the generated hierarchically patterned PDMS with
micropatterns upon DVD channel patterns are shown in Figure S9.

Pattern Transfer to PDMS and Thermoplastic
Materials
The negative imprint of the hierarchical pattern
or micropattern
is processed by pouring uncross-linked PDMS onto the originally patterned
PDMS mold. After 2 h of curing at 120 °C, PDMS is cross-linked
and the pattern is successfully transferred. Hierarchical patterns
of glassy PS were fabricated by placing the patterned PDMS face down
onto PS films deposited on smooth polished silicon wafers. PS (Mw = 3000 g/mol, Polymer Source, Inc.) films
with a thickness of 620 nm (standard deviation: 17.9 nm) were flow-coated
on a silicon wafer. The pattern replication occurs when the entire
“PDMS–PS–silicon wafer” sandwich structure
is annealed in a vacuum oven at 200 °C for 3 h. The entire process
of pattern fabrication is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S9).
