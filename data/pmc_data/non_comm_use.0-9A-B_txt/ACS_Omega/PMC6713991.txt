Many
types of consumer-grade packaging can be used in material
extrusion additive manufacturing processes, providing a high-value
output for waste plastics. However, many of these plastics have reduced
mechanical properties and increased warpage/shrinkage compared to
those commonly used in three-dimensional (3D) printing. The addition
of reinforcing materials can lead to stiffer parts with reduced distortion.
This paper presents work in the reinforcement of recycled polypropylene
using cellulose waste materials to generate a green composite feedstock
for extrusion-based polymer additive manufacturing. Recycled polypropylene/waste
paper, cardboard, and wood flour composites were made using a solid-state
shear pulverization process. Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric
analysis were utilized to qualitatively analyze the amount of filler
incorporated into the 3D-printed materials. Recycled polymer composites
had increased levels of filler incorporated in the printed parts compared
to the virgin polymer composites based on the thermal gravimetric
analysis. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed a ca. 20–30%
increase in storage modulus with the addition of cellulose materials.
Tensile strength was not significantly increased with the addition
of 10 wt % cellulose, but the elastic modulus increased 38% in virgin
polypropylene. The analysis of fracture surfaces revealed that failure
initiates at the interface, suggesting that the interfacial strength
is weaker than the filler strength.

==== Body
Introduction
With the expansion
of three-dimensional (3D) printers and low-cost
extruders to fabricate a filament, the use of recycled plastics in
3D printing is expected to increase. The majority of the work has
been focused on recycling acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene
(ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA).1−4 Zander et al. demonstrated the use of recycled poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET) as well as blends of polypropylene (PP), polystyrene
(PS), and PET.5,6 Baechler and Hart examined the
feasibility of recycling polyethylene.7,8 In addition,
there are a handful of companies that now sell recycled filaments,
including Kickfly (recycled ABS), Maker Geeks (recycled PLA) and Refil
(recycled glycol-modified PET (PETG), PLA, high-impact PS). Plastics
recycled from virgin materials such as failed prints can generally
be recycled at least once without deterioration of mechanical properties.4,9 However, most polymers from packaging materials such as polyolefins
need some types of reinforcement to obtain properties on par with
common commercial materials used in polymer additive manufacturing.
Typical polymers used in material extrusion additive manufacturing
(MEAM) have bulk tensile strengths and elastic moduli ranging between
30 and 100 MPa, 1.3 and 3.6 GPa.10 The
tensile strength and modulus for bulk polypropylene and polyethylene
are on the lower end or below this range at 40 MPa and 1.9 GPa and
15 MPa and 0.8 GPa, respectively.11 Note,
not all packaging polymers fail to fall within this range. PET has
an average strength and a modulus of 70 MPa and 3.1 GPa.12 In addition to shortcomings in mechanical properties
compared to standard polymers used in MEAM, polyolefins are not typically
used due to warpage and shrinkage issues resulting from their high
crystallinity. In addition to improving strength and stiffness, reinforcement
can minimize part distortion by decreasing thermal expansion.13,14

The use of cellulose-based materials as reinforcements for
thermoplastics
is becoming increasingly common. Cellulose/thermoplastic composites
are now used in many applications from decking to automotive paneling.
Companies like THRIVE produce a wide array of injection-molded composites
from virgin and recycled polypropylene (rPP) and cellulose with applications
in automotive, appliances, furniture, construction, sports and recreation,
and personal and household goods. Cellulose materials, such as wood
fibers, offer many advantages over synthetic reinforcing materials
(e.g., glass and carbon fibers). Not only are cellulose materials
abundant, renewable, and inexpensive, they also have a high specific
strength and low bulk density.15 In addition,
compared to glass-filled composites, cellulose composites are less
abrasive, reducing wear and tear on the equipment.

There are
numerous reports in the literature detailing the improved
performance of composites with the addition of cellulose materials.
A challenge in cellulose/polyolefin composites is the limited compatibility
between the hydrophilic filler and hydrophobic matrix, leading to
the lack of interfacial adhesion and also poor filler dispersion.
Mechanical properties can be severely impacted since stress transfer
between filler and matrix requires sufficient interfacial bonding.16 Wettability of the filler by the matrix also
affects toughness. Strong particle–matrix interfacial adhesion
can improve toughness due to efficient stress transfer between phases.
On the other hand, poor wetting can lead to debonding, plastic void
growth, and shear banding mechanisms, which absorb energy and can
improve toughness.17 There has been plenty
of work into coupling agents, which modify the interface, linking
the composite components, to overcome these issues. Maleic anhydride-grafted
polyolefins are one of the most commonly used coupling agents.18−23 Silanes and isocyanates have also been used, reacting with hydroxyl
groups on the cellulose surface.21,24−26 Ito et al. found a reduced linear coefficient of thermal expansion
(LCTE) in uncompatiblized cellulose/PP composites.13 Huang et al. observed similar results in bamboo PP/polyethylene
composites, but the LCTE was further reduced in composites with silane-treated
fillers.14 Bengtsson et al. evaluated the
mechanical properties of sulfite and kraft fiber/polypropylene composites.
Flexural strength and modulus were increased with the addition of
filler and further increased when a maleic anhydride-grafted polymer
coupling agent was used.15 Karmarkar et
al. prepared a novel compatibilizer consisting of an isocyanate functional
group on PP and evaluated its effect on the kraft pulp. Tensile and
flexural strengths increased by 45 and 85%, respectively.27 Cantero et al. compared the effect of three
different surface treatments (maleic anhydride, maleated PP, and vinyl
trimethoxy silane) on flax fiber/PP composites. Composites with maleated
PP had the best mechanical properties, whereas the other surface treatments
had essentially no effect compared to untreated controls.28 Pickering and Ji found improvements in Young’s
modulus of 77–177% for New Zealand pine-reinforced PP composites
when isocyanate and maleic anhydride PP coupling agents were used.29

Dispersion of the filler is also critical
to the mechanical performance
of the composite and is influenced by the wetting of the polymer as
well as mixing techniques. The addition of coupling agents and compatibilizers,
as discussed above, leads to improved wetting and generally better
dispersion. Improved dispersion can also be achieved through better
mixing via a twin-screw extruder, even in the absence of a strong
particle–matrix interface.17 Mathieu
compared three mixing methods for the dispersion of hydroxyapatite
or β-tricalcium phosphate into PLA: dry, solvent, and melt extrusion.
The ceramic particles agglomerated due to van der Waals and electrostatic
forces in the dry mixing case, whereas the solvent and melt extrusion
led to homogenous mixing.30

Although
twin-screw extrusion has many advantages in terms of high-throughput,
versatility, and cost, the fabrication of biocomposites with well-dispersed
fillers remains a challenge. The stresses in such a system are generally
not large enough to break up agglomerates of filler, and most operating
temperatures are at or above the degradation temperatures of cellulose-based
fillers (200 °C). Solid-state shear pulverization (SSSP) is an
approach that can potentially overcome the issue of cellulose filler
dispersion and premature degradation. SSSP uses high shear and compressive
forces to reduce filler size and disperse materials within a matrix
material. Depending on the energy input, the process can also serve
as a means of reactively compatibilizing immiscible materials via
polymer chain scission and free-radical formation.31 It has been used to compatibilize polymer blends and also
distribute nano- and microsized fillers in polymers.32−35 The SSSP process has been used by Iyer et al. for the fabrication
of cellulose-reinforced polyolefin composites. In their work, microcrystalline
cellulose (MCC) was extracted from low-cost cellulose-based waste
materials such as waste paper and corrugated cardboard (CB).36,37 With the addition of 10 and 15 wt % cardboard, Young’s modulus
for LDPE and PP composites increased 63 and 71%, respectively, without
the addition of a coupling agent. Similar results were observed by
replacing the cardboard with a waste paper. Iwamoto et al. dispersed
lignocellulose nanofibers functionalized with maleic anhydride PP
in polypropylene using SSSP, resulting in improved Young’s
moduli, yield strengths, and toughness.38 The work by Iyer et al. suggested that a compatibilizer is not required
when using the SSSP process, yet Iwamoto et al. still utilized one
for their work. Thus, the question remains whether a compatibilizer
is needed when processing immisible materials using SSSP and will
be discussed further in the text.

The aforementioned studies
are generally molded materials, but
the focus of this paper is on utilizing cellulose composites for MEAM.
There have been some recent works in this area. Tao et al. added 5
wt % wood flour (WF) to PLA and observed changes in microstructure
and crystallinity.39 Le Duigou et al. evaluated
the effects of printing parameters on ColorFabb’s WoodFill
filament.40 Macadamia shells were ground
and incorporated into ABS composites by Girdis et al.41 Kaynak et al. prepared PP/microcrystalline cellulose filaments
for MEAM and found improvement in the tensile strength for crystals
functionalized with hydrophobic silanes.42 A handful of companies also sell cellulose-based composite filaments
such as Laywood (CC Products), 3D-Fuels’s Wound Up coffee and
Entwined hemp filaments, and ColorFabb’s Woodfill and BambooFill.

In this work, readily available cellulose materials from waste
paper, cardboard, and wood flour were incorporated into recycled and
commercial of the shelf (COTS) polypropylene using the SSSP process.
Powders were melt-processed into filaments for MEAM and printed into
test specimens. The effect of filler loading and type was evaluated
and compared to a COTS PP model system.

Results and Discussion
A solid-state shear pulverization process was utilized to fabricate
polypropylene/celluose composites for MEAM 3D printing. The work done
on the polymer by the shearing forces served to reduce the particle
size of the cellulose materials. Figure 1 displays the polymer and cellulose prior
to processing, SSSP powder, and resulting filament after melt processing
the powder. All formulations were able to be 3D printed, but a 0.8
mm nozzle was required since some materials clogged the standard 0.5
mm nozzle. The clogging was likely due to cellulose materials that
did not have sufficient size reduction during the SSSP process as
well as agglomerated particles. Due to the apparent low density of
the cardboard and paper materials, they did not always remain well
mixed with the polymer before reaching the extruder. Thus, some materials
had less polymer during the SSSP processing step to aid in shearing
the cellulose and reducing particle size. Sections along the length
of a filament spool were examined by scanning electron microscope
(SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supporting Information, Figures S1–S3). The rPP/CB composites
have a greater loading of cellulose compared to the commercial PP
(cPP)/CB composites, but loading does not change significantly along
the ca. 30 ft. examined. Further, weight percent remaining by TGA
does not show significant differences in char along each respective
filament.

Figure 2 displays
SEM images of the composite powder particles. It can be clearly seen
that the cellulose particle size has been greatly reduced from millimeters
to less than ca. 50 micrometers. The reduction of the filler dimension
enabled facile 3D printing, as the nozzle diameter is at least one
order of magnitude larger than the size of the filler.

Chemical analysis via Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) was utilized
to qualitatively probe the composition of the cellulose filler incorporated
within the printed polymer composites. Figure S4 in the Supporting Information displays the OH stretching
peak for cellulose at ca. 3350 cm–1.4343 The peak is essentially
absent in the pure PP and generally increases with the addition of
cellulose. Figure 3 and Table 1, in which
the cellulose hydroxyl stretch was normalized by the PP CH2 asymmetric stretching peak (2917 cm–1), show the
trends more clearly. In general, the normalized peak areas increase
with the addition of cellulose, but the trend is only linear in the
rPP/CB composites. The rPP/WF composite behaves in an opposite manner,
with a decreasing peak area with the addition of WF. The largest normalized
peak areas for the cPP are highest for the 10 and 20% WP followed
by the 20% CB. In contrast, the rPP had the highest normalized peak
areas for the 20% CB followed by the 5% WF. With the exception of
the WF composites, the cPP composites had higher normalized peak areas
compared to the rPP composites. Dispersion appears uniform based on
filament cross-sections and is not the likely reason for this difference.
However, in Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance
(FTIR-ATR), the beam only penetrates into the top 1–2 μm
of the surface, and the surface layers of the cPP materials may have
more cellulose material, or radical polymer chains could have reacted
with water during processing.

Natural cellulose materials generally have degradation
temperatures,
which start around 200 °C, making them unsuitable for processing
above this temperature.44 Thermogravimetric
analysis was used in comparison to evaluate filler loading, as well
as understand the effects of the filler on thermal stability. Some
weight loss is evident around 100 °C for the composites, which
is attributed to moisture loss (Figure 4). The low-temperature degradation begins at 250–300
°C for the filled materials (thermal degradation of hemicelluloses)
and 400 °C for the decomposition of the neat polymers. The second
decomposition process occurs between 300 and 400 °C, which is
attributed to the decomposition of cellulose.45 The rPP has some additional degradation occurring at ca. 650 °C,
possibly due to the decomposition of additives and fillers in the
recycled polymer. Table 1 presents the decomposition temperature at which the most weight
loss occurred determined from the derivative weight. Graphs are presented
in Supporting Information (Figure S5).
The WP, CB, and WF degrade at ca. 360–370 °C when not
incorporated in a polymer matrix (see Supporting Information Figure S6). The pure polymers degrade at ca.
462 °C (cPP) and 472 °C (rPP). The composites had similar
thermal stability for the polymer materials, with maximum decomposition
temperatures to ca. 458–479 °C.

Table 1 also
presents
the wt % remaining at 500 °C with any contribution from the polymer
subtracted. TGA of the neat cellulose materials resulted in 13–28%
mass remaining at 500 °C. Thus, the masses of the composites
at 500 °C were scaled by these percentages to estimate an expected
mass based on the targeted composition. These estimates are shown
in Table S1 in the supplementary data and
compared with the measured masses.

The wt % remaining for the
cPP/cellulose composites increased with
filler loading and was within about 1 wt % of the expected range for
the cPP series. The rPP composites also followed the trend of increased
wt % remaining with increased filler with the exception of the wood
flour composites. For this system, the 5 wt % composite had the highest
wt % remaining. The rPP/CB and rPP/WF composites had much higher char
formation than was expected. One possible cause could be uneven mixing,
with the portion of the extrudate that was 3D printed having higher
loadings of filler. However, this is unlikely due to the double extrusion
processing that was conducted in which the extrudate was pelletized
and re-extruded to make the final filament used for printing. In addition,
as discussed previously, Figures S1–S3 show even filler distribution. Another cause could have been free-radical
formation and cross-linking during the SSSP process, which could have
changed char forming properties of the composites and/or locked in
filler to matrix ratios at this processing stage. This effect may
have been magnified in the rPP 5 wt % WF composites, with more polymer
available to bond to the cellulose. The three types of cellulose used
have different compositions with large variations in the amount of
lignin, in particular, which may have also affected char formation.
Wood has the highest (27%), whereas cardboard (14%) and paper (1%)
have less. Paper has a secondary decomposition peak at 650 °C,
which could be attributed to lignin degradation and/or impurities/chemicals
from the manufacturing process, such as CaCO3.46 For the case of rPP composites, char formation
was reduced with the addition of WP compared to other rPP composites,
whereas the opposite trend was observed in the cPP composites. These
differences can potentially be explained by the additives in the recycled
polymer and the effect on char formation. Figure S7 displays FTIR spectra of rPP and cPP. There are additional
peaks for the rPP material at ca. 720 and 850 cm–1.

The 3D-printed composites were analyzed using differential
scanning
calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to probe the
thermal and mechanical properties. Cellulose fillers are generally
thought of as good nucleation agents for polymer crystallization,
but this depends strongly on particle size, dispersion and interfacial
adhesion within the polymer matrix.47,48 Iyer et al.
reported a ca. 10 °C increase in crystallization temperature
and 4–8% increase in crystallinity for cellulose-reinforced
PP prepared by SSSP.36 Wang et al. found
the nucleation efficiency was dependent on the particle surface area
and topography.49 Spherical particles with
smooth surfaces had weaker nucleation ability compared to coarse fibers.
Tajvidi et al. also reported an increase in crystallinity for cellulose
fiber/PP composites, but only for those compatibilized with a maleic
anhydride PP coupling agent.45 In this
work, crystallization temperatures (Tc) increased by 1–6 °C for the recycled PP/cellulose formulations
compared to the melt-processed rPP control, with the exception of
the 20 wt % paper composites (Table 2 and Figure 5). Larger increases in Tc were
observed for the virgin PP composites, ranging from 6 to 10 °C
compared to the melt-processed cPP control. Interestingly, the SSSP
processed cPP control had a 6.5 °C increase in Tc compared to the melt-processed cPP, whereas the opposite
trend occurred for the rPP SSSP control. This may be related to the
additives/fillers in the rPP and a reduction in the nucleation efficiency
of these fillers due to the SSSP process (see FTIR in Supporting Information Figure S7).

Fractional crystallinity generally decreased with the addition
of filler likely due to the larger particle sizes and poorer filler
compatibility compared to the aforementioned works. To compare the
SSSP process used in this work to the work of Iyer et al., the specific
energy input (Ep) was calculated (Table S2). In this work, Ep was 2.7 kJ/g, whereas Iyer et al. used Ep’s ranging from 5 to 35 kJ/g. Our Ep was severely limited by the small size and torque limitations
of the Process 11 extruder. Based on Iyer’s work, smaller Ep’s generally lead to larger particle
sizes and reduced mechanical properties.37

The glass transition temperature, probed using DMA via tan δ,
was found to be similar or reduced for the filled samples compared
to the controls. This was unexpected since reinforcement generally
leads to a restriction in chain motion, resulting in an increase in Tg. But Tao et al. also observed a depressed Tg, which was attributed to the poor compatibility
between the filler and the matrix.39,50,51

Figure 6 displays
the storage modulus versus temperature for the COTS PP and rPP cellulose
composites. The COTS and recycled PP controls (either processed via
SSSP or solely melt processed) have similar moduli of ca. 2000 MPa.
The addition of cellulose materials generally served to increase the
modulus with the exception of 10 and 20 wt % WF in cPP and 5 wt %
CB in rPP. The addition of paper had the greatest impact on the modulus
for the cPP, whereas WF and 20 wt % CB had the most effect on rPP.
It was expected that higher loadings would lead to stiffer composites,
but in some cases like the cPP 5 wt % WP and WF, the lowest loading
led to the highest storage modulus. It should be noted though that
there is inherent uncertainty in modulus values due to variations
in the thickness. Samples prepared by MEAM have additional uncertainty
due to the random adhesion failure between printed roads.

This trend was also observed in the tensile results (Figures 7 and 8). The highest tensile strengths were found in the unfilled
systems
due to the weak interface between the filler and polymer, with the
cPP having higher strength than the rPP. The strain at failure was
generally reduced as expected for the reinforced systems, with the
exception of the cPP WF (17.0 ± 0.05 vs 14.5 ± 0.3%, cPP
WF vs cPP control). Interestingly, this composite had the highest
tensile strength and modulus of all of the composites. Many other
researchers have also reported a reduction in tensile strength for
unmodified cellulose fillers in PP. Samat et al. evaluated the tensile
properties of injection molded recycled PP with varying amounts microcrystalline
cellulose ranging from 5 to 40 wt %. Tensile strengths of composites
were higher than reported in our work and averaged ca. 20–23
MPa but were also decreased compared to the unreinforced PP. The elastic
moduli ranged from ca. 1000 to 1500 MPa, comparable to the 3D-printed
composites.52 Kaynak et al. found modest
improvements in Young’s modulus for PP with 10 wt % unmodified
microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) (640–730 MPa) but reduced
tensile strength.42 Tao et al. reported
reduced tensile strength for PLA/WF 3D-printed composites.39 Mathew et al. found reduced tensile strength
for both MCC and WF/PP composites, which was attributed to the agglomeration
of the MCC crystals and poor adhesion between the filler and matrix.53 Iyer et al. reported a 21% decrease in tensile
strength for PP/WP composites with specific energy inputs of 5–7
kJ/g or 2–3 times the Ep used in
this work. Tensile strengths were comparable to neat PP with Ep ≥ 14 kJ/g.37

The elastic modulus was
increased significantly for all of the
cPP composites except the cPP/10 wt % WP. Elastic moduli increases
were not statistically significant for the rPP composites, but it
is clear that the average values for rPP, WP, and WF are higher than
the control. There is inherently a fair amount of the scatter for
samples prepared by 3D printing as well as the distribution of fillers.
But in the case of the rPP polymer, there may be additional scatter
due to the nonuniformity of the recycled polymer.

Many of the
tensile bars curled up from the bed after printing.
Certain printing techniques such as the use of a brim or raft can
potentially improve adhesion and reduce warpage. In this case, a brim
did not reduce warpage and a raft was not tried due to material shortages.
Tensile bars with gauge regions that were distorted were not included
in the results. In addition, pneumatic grips were utilized to ensure
totally flat tensile specimens. Warpage is a major limitation for
the use of polypropylene in additive manufacturing processes. The
warpage of recycled PP is reduced compared to cPP due to the fillers
and dyes added to give the packaging its desired properties. The addition
of celluose-based fillers was expected to further reduce warpage,
but no noticeable difference was observed by the eye. However, the
composites were slightly easier to print, suggesting that the cellulose
served to control shrinkage. Further characterization of warpage was
outside of the scope of this work but should be addressed for the
further development of such feedstocks. One method to characterize
warpage is to measure the height and length of the printed part relative
to the size of the model since warping occurred out-of-plane relative
to the print bed.

Figure 9 displays
tensile fracture surfaces of the PP/cellulose composites. The Supporting
Information Figure S8 displays polished
fracture surfaces. The dispersion of the filler appears fairly uniform,
and there is little evidence of agglomeration. Fiber pull-out and
debonding are observed in all of the composite fracture surfaces,
indicating a weak interface between the matrix and filler. As discussed
above, a more powerful extruder/different SSSP screw configuration
to achieve higher specific energy input and/or reduced particle sizes
of the starting materials achieved via cryo-milling or other means
could lead to improved bonding and mechanical properties.

Materials and Methods
Mixing and Extrusion
Materials
Greek
yogurt containers (Wegmans and Great
Value brands) were used for the source of recycled PP (rPP). Commercial
PP (cPP) was purchased from Total Petrochemicals (PPH 3270, melt flow
index 2 g/10 min, density 0.905 g/cm3, melting temperature
165 °C). Office printer paper was used as the source of waste
paper (WP), whereas corrugated cardboard was used for the cardboard
(CB) source. Wood flour (WF) was purchased from Amazon and used as
received. The cellulose sources were not dried. Recycled polypropylene
(rPP) from yogurt containers was cleaned by rinsing with water, ethanol
and drying in the air at room temperature. The labels were removed
before cutting into pieces that could be fed into the paper shredder
(Compucessory model CCS60075). Waste paper (WP) and cardboard (CB)
were fed through an identical cross-paper shredder.

Melt Extrusion
Shredded rPP polymer was first consolidated
into pellets using melt extrusion on a Process 11 twin-screw extruder
(Thermo Scientific). The screws were fixed in an all-conveying configuration.
The feed port was set at 140 °C and the adjacent zone to 170
°C to prevent clumping of the material while feeding. The following
5 zones were fixed at 180 °C. The die (2.5 mm) was set at 175
°C. The screw speed was held constant at 100 rpm. A spooler (Filabot)
was used to collect the filament, which was subsequently pelletized
in 1.5 mm pellets (15 m/min, Varicut Pelletizer, Thermo Scientific).

Solid-State Shear Pulverization
Composites of WP/cPP,
CB/cPP, WF/cPP, WP/rPP, CB/rPP, and WF/rPP were prepared each with
3 different loadings of the cellulose material (18 different formulations).
In addition, control samples of PP without cellulose were also prepared
using SSSP. To prepare the composites, WP, CB, WF, and PP were weighed
to generate mixtures of 5, 10, and 20 wt % loading of cellulose and
hand-mixed before loading into a single screw feeder fixed above the
feeding port on a Process 11 twin-screw extruder (MK2, Thermo Scientific).
For the SSSP process, the screws of the Process 11 twin-screw extruder
were configured to provide high shear to reduce the particle size
of the filler. The 40 L/D screw design contained two areas of extreme
mixing. After the feeding section, there was a 30° mixing section
followed by a 60° mixing section. After the first mixing and
middle conveying section, there was a long 90° mixing block and
then short conveying section (see Figure 10).

= conveying screws;
30°, 60°, 90° = degree mixing sections.

Filament Fabrication
The powder
from the SSSP process
was then melt-processed, as described above. Filament diameter uniformity
from the first melt-processing step was generally quite poor due to
the low density of the powder, and, thus, the extrudate was pelletized
and re-extruded in a second melt-processing step, resulting in a denser
filament with a diameter of 2.2 ± 0.2 mm.

Three-dimensional
Printing
Both Type V tensile bars
(ASTM D638) and DMA bars (35 mm × 12.5 mm × 2 mm) were printed
on a Lulzbot Taz 6 MEAM printer for characterization. Recycled PP
and COTS PP were printed on a clear packing tape surface with a 0.8
mm nozzle. Simplify 3D was used to for slicing and generating toolpaths
and code. For all samples, a 100 °C bed temperature and a 220
°C nozzle temperature were used. A Y or flat on the bed build
orientation was used, with 0.2 mm layer height, 2 shell layers, and
100% infill.54 A 45/–45° orientation
for the infill was used for tensile bars and 0° for DMA bars.
Tensile and DMA bar print speeds were 50 and 20 mm/s, respectively.

Materials Characterization
Chemical information was
obtained via analysis by Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total
reflectance (FTIR-ATR) (Thermo Nicolet Nexus 870 ESP) using 256 scans
and 4 cm–1 resolution over a range of 4000–400
cm–1.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
with a heat/cool program (Discovery DSC, TA Instruments) was used
to evaluate thermal properties. Samples were heated at 20 °C
per min to 200 °C and cooled at the same rate to −50 °C.
TRIOS software (TA Instruments) was used to analyze the data. Fractional
crystallinity (Xc) was calculated using
the following equation  Where ΔHf is the heat of fusion
of the sample, ΔHf° is the heat of fusion of a 100% crystalline
PP (207 J/g), and w is the mass fraction of PP in
composites.45,55

Dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA, Q800 TA Instruments) enabled
characterization of the thermal–mechanical properties using
the single cantilever mode. The temperature was ramped from −50
to 150 °C at a rate of 2 °C per min and a frequency of 1.0
Hz. The amplitude set-point was 200 μm. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was conducted on a Q5000 (TA Instruments). All samples were
heated at 20 °C per min to 800 °C under nitrogen.

Melt rheology at 180 °C was measured on an ARES G2 rheometer
(TA Instruments) with 25 mm parallel aluminum plates. The gap was
fixed at 1000 μm, and the shear rate was ramped from 0.1 to
10 s–1. The axial force was 20 g while taring, the
strain amplitude set at 1%, and the frequency sweep was collected
over 210 s.

Tensile testing was performed, as previously described.5 Briefly, uniaxial tensile experiments were performed
at a displacement rate of 2 mm/min on a servohydraulic test frame
with pneumatic side actuated grips (Instron, 30 psi) and 5 kN load
cell (Instron model 5000R). The strain was determined from a digital
image correlation system.

The morphology of the SSSP powders
and broken tensile specimens
was probed using a scanning electron microscope (5 kV, SEM, Phenom
XL) after sputter coating with gold–palladium. Select fracture
surfaces were polished by casting in epoxy cylinders with the surface
of importance facing outward. Once the epoxy hardened, a polishing
wheel was used with polishing compounds of a 9, 3, 1, and 1/4 μm
diamond suspension in water-based slurry in succession until the desired
surface finish was achieved.
