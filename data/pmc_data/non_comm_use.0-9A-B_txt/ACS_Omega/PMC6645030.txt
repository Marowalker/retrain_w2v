A protocol is developed to allow
the accurate characterization
of partition to lipid bilayers for solutes with low affinity, using
isothermal titration calorimetry. The methodology proposed is suitable
for studies using complex membranes, such as intact biomembranes or
whole cells. In the method developed, the association is characterized
at increasing solute concentrations. This allows the characterization
of solute partition into unperturbed membranes, as well as effects
induced by high solute concentrations. Most druglike molecules are
expected to interact with low-to-moderate affinity with relevant cell
membranes. This is due to both the need for a relatively high aqueous
solubility of the drug and the poor binding properties of the cell
membranes. The methodology is applied to characterize the interaction
of antibiotic Rifampicin with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and with lipid bilayers representative
of bacterial membranes.

Introduction
The association of
drugs and biological ligands with lipid bilayers
is a key step in their permeation through biological membranes, which
is determinant for their disposition and availability at the target
site.1,2 There are several methods that may be used
to characterize the association of biologically active molecules with,
or their permeation through, biomembranes (see ref (3) for a recent review). Among
the available approaches, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is
particularly important, as it gives information on both the extent
of association and the nature of the interactions established.3−15 The methods available are however limited to ligands with intermediate
to high partition coefficients and cannot be used for typical drugs
and/or to characterize the association with very ordered lipid bilayers.4−9 In the usual method used to obtain the association of small molecules
with lipid bilayers, the lipid is added to an aqueous solution of
the small molecule (solute). After injection i, the
lipid concentration in the cell increases from that after the previous
injection ([L]i−1) to [L]i, and this leads to an increase in the number
of solute molecules that associate with the lipid bilayer from which
heat qi is evolved, eq 1(6,8,10) 1  where nS_Li–1 and nS_Li are the numbers of moles of
solute associated with the lipid bilayer
before and after injection i, respectively; ΔH° is the molar enthalpy variation associated with
the transfer of solute from the aqueous media to the lipid bilayer; Vi and Vcell are,
respectively, the volume injected in each titration step and the volume
of the cell; and qdil is the heat of diluting
the concentrated lipid solution. For small solutes at low local concentrations,
the association with the lipid bilayer is best described by a partition
coefficient from which the amount of solute in the membrane after
each lipid injection may be calculated, eq 2 2  where KPobs is the observed
partition coefficient
between the aqueous and the lipid phase (hereafter, represented simply
by KP), [L*]i is the lipid concentration available for solute association after
injection i, and V̅L is the molar volume of the lipid when organized in lipid bilayers.5,6 The dependence of the heat evolved on the concentration of lipid
in the ITC cell is obtained by combining eqs 1 and 2 3  The amount of lipid added to the cell in each
injection is constant throughout the titration, which leads to an
approximately linear increase in the concentration of lipid in this
compartment (the increase is not strictly linear due to an increase
in the total volume of the solution); also, it is assumed that overflow
from the cell occurs faster than equilibration of the injected solution
with the content of the cell.

If the term KP[L*]iV̅L in eq 3 is much smaller
than 1, the increment in the number
of moles of solute associated with the lipid bilayer after each injection
is constant throughout the titration. In this situation, the heat
evolved in each injection does not vary significantly as the titration
proceeds and is proportional to the enthalpy variation times the partition
coefficient, allowing the characterization of only the product of
both parameters. To allow obtaining both the partition coefficient
and the enthalpy variation, it is necessary to reach lipid concentrations
in the cell where the product KP[L*]iV̅L is close to or higher than
unity. In Figure 1,
the predicted variation of KP[L*]iV̅L and the resulting variation
in the fraction of solute associated with the lipid bilayers as the
titration proceeds are represented, for a concentration of lipid in
the syringe equal to 50 mM and distinct values of the partition coefficient.
For KP equal to 300, the product KP[L*]iV̅L reaches a value of 2 at the end of the titration and there
is a clear and nonlinear variation in nS_Li – nS_Li–1, allowing the full characterization of
the interaction of the solute with the lipid bilayer (KP and ΔH°). For a partition
coefficient equal to 100, KP[L*]iV̅L reaches only 0.7 at the
end of the titration and the variation in nS_Li – nS_Li–1 is less accentuated, leading to large uncertainties
in the characterization of both KP and
ΔH° by this method. Lower affinities,
exemplified in Figure 1 by KP = 30, lead to very small variations
in nS_Li – nS_Li–1, which are
due to the nonproportional increase in the lipid concentration in
the cell and the dilution of the solute due to the increase in the
total volume of the solution that accompanies the addition of lipid
aliquots. In this case, it is not possible to obtain KP or ΔH°, only their product.

Figure 1 Dependence
of the product KP[L*]iV̅L (lines) and of the increment
per injection in the fraction of solute associated with the lipid
bilayer (symbols) on the injection number (i) and
the concentration of lipid in the cell, for a concentration of lipid
in the syringe equal to 50 mM in a typical experiment with 10 μL
injections into a 1500 μL cell and for a partition coefficient
equal to 300 (open circle black, —), 100 (open circle dark
gray, dark gray), or 30 (open circle light gray, light gray). The
inset shows the incremental variation of the amount of solute associated
with the lipid bilayer normalized by the variation observed in the
first injection of lipid.

The concentration of lipid in the syringe considered in Figure 1 (50 mM) is close
to the upper limit that may be achieved with 100 nm large unilamellar
vesicles. In fact, for solutes with intermediate polarity, the rate
of translocation through the lipid bilayer is expected to be low4,5 and only the lipid in the outer leaflet of the liposomes is accessible
to the solute. Therefore, to achieve a concentration of 50 mM lipid
accessible to the solute ([L*]), it is necessary to have at least
100 mM total lipid in the syringe. In spite of this high lipid concentration
in the syringe, the maximum concentration in the cell is only 8.5
mM, which makes this method only adequate to characterize the interaction
for solutes with intermediate to high affinities for the membrane.

Higher lipid concentrations in the cell could be obtained if the
lipid is placed in the cell and titrated with the ligand. This is
the usual methodology followed to characterize binding to proteins,
the heat evolved being proportional to the fraction of binding sites
available in the protein.14 However, this
approach cannot be used to characterize the association of solutes
with lipid bilayers due to the inexistence of well-defined binding
sites in the bilayers. Variations in the heat evolved as the titration
proceeds reflect changes in the affinity of the solute to the lipid
bilayer due to perturbation of the membrane by the solute and not
to the decrease in empty binding sites.

In this work, we develop
a method that uses the advantages of both
approaches (lipid in the cell or in the syringe) to allow the characterization
of the association parameters for the case of solutes with low affinity
for the bilayers. Most drugs are expected to partition to lipid bilayers
with a moderate to low affinity, as they must be relatively polar
to guarantee a significant solubility in the aqueous media. Also,
cell plasma membranes are usually very cohesive, which leads to even
lower affinities for druglike solutes.3,4,16−20 The apical membrane of endothelial and epithelial cells is enriched
in cholesterol and sphingomyelin,21 and
bacterial membranes have large amounts of phosphatidylethanolamines
(PEs) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG).22,23 In the method
proposed in this work, the lipid is placed in the cell and is titrated
with the ligand, which is in the syringe. Several independent titrations
with increasing lipid concentrations are performed to allow obtaining
the partition coefficient and the enthalpy variation from eqs 1 and 2. For each lipid concentration used, several solute injections are
performed until all solution in the syringe is titrated into the lipid
in the cell. This allows characterizing the effect of the solute concentration
on its interaction with the membranes. In this work, the procedure
required for the analysis of the results is developed and made available
to the scientific community.

The method is applied to the characterization
of the interaction
of antibiotic Rifampicin (Rif) with lipid bilayers prepared from pure
1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) and from a mixture 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE)/POPC/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) at a molar ratio of
5:3:2, which model, respectively, intracellular membranes of eukaryotic
cells and bacterial membranes.21−23 In aqueous solution at neutral
pH values, Rifampicin has a negatively charged phenolic group (pKa = 1.7) and a positively charged piperazine
nitrogen (pKa = 7.9),24 presenting a global charge equal to −0.24 at the
pH used in this work (7.4). Given the size, polarity, and charge of
Rifampicin, a slow rate of translocation through the hydrophobic core
of the lipid bilayer would be expected. However, the rate of permeation
of Rifampicin through POPC membranes has been characterized using
the pH variation approach and permeation is reported to occur in less
than 1 s.25,26 Accordingly, all the lipid was considered
accessible to the ligand ([L*] = [L]).

Results and Discussion
The heat evolved due to titration of Rifampicin (RIF) with POPC
and with the ternary mixture POPE/POPC/POPG (5:3:2) following the
usual protocol (addition of lipid to the solute) is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Titration of Rifampicin
following the usual protocol, with lipid
added to the solute. Plot (A) shows the heat evolved due to the addition
of 10 μL aliquots of POPC, 20 mM, into a buffer solution containing
RIF at 10 μM, whereas in plot (B), aliquots of the ternary mixture
POPE/POPC/POPG (5:3:2) at 30 mM are added to 10 μM RIF. The
lines are the best fit of eqs 1 and 2, with parameters KP = 1.9 × 103 and 8 × 101 for plots (A) and (B), respectively. The insets show the dependence
of the quality of the best fit on the value of the partition coefficient
to highlight the large uncertainty associated with this parameter
for the data in plot (B), the black solid lines are the best fit of
a parabola, and the dashed lines correspond to the confidence intervals
at the percentage indicated (95% for plot (A) and 20% for plot (B)).

RIF associates efficiently with
the POPC membranes with a high
partition coefficient (KP = 1.9 ×
103) and a negative enthalpy variation (ΔH° = −10.5 kJ/mol). On the other hand, the affinity
of RIF toward the ternary lipid mixture is low (KP ≅ 8 × 101) and shows a positive
enthalpy variation. In this case, the heat evolved changes almost
linearly with the lipid concentration, which prevents a rigorous characterization
of the association of RIF with this membrane. The values obtained
for the partition coefficient compare well with previously published
data using derivative spectrophotometry, where KP was equal to 1.2 × 103 and 1.2 × 102 for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol
bilayers, respectively.27 Note that the
definitions of KP in the present work
and in the cited reference are different; the values shown in the
text have been converted for the definition used in this work (eq 2).

The insets in Figure 2 show the dependence
of the quality of the best fit (χ2) on the value
of KP.28 The
association of RIF with the POPC membrane
is well-characterized, 1.6 × 103 < KP < 2.2 × 103 with 95% confidence.
However, for the ternary mixture, there is only 20% confidence that
the value of KP is included in the interval
[7, 1.5 × 102], the upper limit going up to 2.9 ×
102 for 95% confidence. Given the large uncertainty associated
with the parameters for the partition of RIF toward the POPE/POPC/POPG
(5:3:2) membrane, we have performed new titrations with the addition
of RIF to lipid solutions in the cell, allowing the use of higher
lipid concentrations. The results obtained are shown in Figures 3 and 4.

Figure 3 Titration of RIF into different concentrations of POPE/POPC/POPG
(5:3:2; indicated in the plot): the left panel corresponds to the
heat of dilution of RIF into the buffer solution. The concentration
of RIF in the syringe is equal to 200 μM in all titrations,
leading to concentrations of 1.4 and 33 μM after the first and
last injections of 10 μL, respectively.

Figure 4 Plot (A): heat evolved in the 1st (□), 10th (dark gray),
and 28th (light gray) addition of RIF to liposomes prepared from the
ternary mixture POPE/POPC/POPG (5:3:2) as a function of the lipid
concentration in the cell; the lines are the best fit of eqs 1 and 2. The
dependence of KP (■, □)
and ΔH° (symbols in light gray) on the
concentration of RIF in the cell (extent of titration) is shown in
plot (B) considering the heat evolved due to each RIF addition (open
symbols) or the cumulative heat from the first injection to that being
considered (filled symbols).

The heat evolved when RIF is added to the buffer solution
is due
to its dilution from 200 μM (concentration in the syringe) to
concentrations in the range from 1.4 to 33 μM. The observation
that this heat is small and essentially unchanged throughout the titration
indicates that there is no change in the aggregation state in this
range of concentrations (1.4–200 μM) and was interpreted
as RIF being in the monomeric state. As the concentration of lipid
in the cell increases, the heat evolved due to the addition of each
10 μL of the RIF solution becomes more positive, indicating
that a higher fraction of solute has partitioned into the lipid bilayer
and that the partition is endothermic. These experiments have been
performed at additional lipid concentrations, and the heat evolved
in the first, last, and at injection 10 is represented in Figure 4 as a function of
the lipid concentration in the cell. This data was analyzed with eqs 1 and 2 to obtain the partition coefficient and the interaction enthalpy
variation (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet provided in the Supporting Information). The parameters resulting
from the heat evolved due to each ligand addition are represented
in Figure 4B by open
symbols. There is a significant variation in the values obtained for KP and ΔH° throughout
the titration, which is essentially random, with perhaps a small decrease
in KP as the concentration of ligand increases.
The similarity of the heats per injection obtained as the titration
proceeds is also visible in plot A. The filled symbols in plot B correspond
to the parameters obtained from the cumulative heat evolved (from
injection 1 to injection i). The increased sampling
reduces the uncertainty associated with the parameters without a strong
dependence on the concentration of ligand. The average values obtained
from the heat evolved in each titration are KP = 1.3(±0.3) × 102 and ΔH° 13 ± 1 kJ/mol, which compare well with the
results obtained from the cumulative heats at the end of the titration, KP = 1.4 × 101 and ΔH° = 13 kJ/mol.

Under the conditions of these
experiments, the local concentration
of Rifampicin in the lipid bilayer is always very small (always less
than 0.3%, which is the concentration attained in the last injection
into the smaller lipid concentration and corresponds to a ratio of
accessible lipid to bound RIF equal to 375). These small local concentrations
are not expected to perturb significantly the lipid bilayer and substantiate
the results obtained, association parameters independent of the concentration
of ligand.

This method has also been applied to characterize
the association
of RIF with liposomes prepared from pure POPC, to allow a comparison
between the results obtained with the usual and modified methods.
The results are shown in Figures 5 and 6. In contrast to what
was observed for the ternary mixture, the heat evolved decreases significantly
as the titration proceeds, especially for small concentrations of
lipid, Figure 5. The
dependence of the heat evolved in each solute injection on the lipid
concentration is shown in Figure 6A, together with the best fit with eqs 1 and 2, and
the values obtained for KP and ΔH° are shown in plot B as a function of the concentration
of RIF at the end of the respective injection. A strong decrease is
observed in the partition coefficient as the titration proceeds. At
the smallest concentration of RIF (first injection, leading to a total
concentration of RIF in the cell equal to 1.4 μM), the association
with the POPC liposomes is very efficient (KP = 2.5 × 103). Under these conditions, the
ratio of lipid to RIF in the membrane (POPC/RIFM) is 529
at the lower lipid concentration, being even higher at the other lipid
concentrations. As more RIF is added to the liposomes, the local concentration
in the membrane increases, and this hinders the association of additional
solute molecules, leading to a decrease in the observed association
affinity. The addition of RIF to a POPC solution already containing
10 μM RIF (injection 9) leads to KP = 0.8 × 103, and for the highest concentration of
RIF (33 μM, injection 28), KP =
0.3 × 103. At this high total solute concentration,
POPC/RIFM = 135 at the smallest lipid concentration and
increases to 322 at the highest. The corresponding local concentrations
of RIF are not very high (0.7 and 0.3%, respectively), but these results
indicate a strong perturbation of the membrane, which decreases the
affinity of RIF toward the membrane. In previous studies, we have
characterized the effect of the concentration of other solutes (sodium
dodecyl sulfate,6 chlorpromazine,5 and bile salts4) and
found that below 4% these small molecules do not affect significantly
their association with the POPC bilayer. These small solutes are charged
at the pH value used (single negative charge for sodium dodecyl sulfate
and bile salts and a single positive charge for chlorpromazine), but
at the high ionic strength used, the electrostatic potential in the
membrane introduced by the ligands at those small concentrations is
negligible.5 Rifampicin is a zwitterion
and therefore the stronger perturbation observed cannot be due to
the generation of a large electrostatic potential in the membrane.
The results obtained in this work may be due to the larger molecular
weight of Rifampicin, which interacts with a higher number of lipids
in the membrane.

Figure 5 Titration of RIF into different concentrations of POPC
(indicated
in the plot): the left panel corresponds to the heat of dilution of
RIF into the buffer solution. The concentration of RIF in the syringe
is equal to 200 μM in all titrations, leading to concentrations
of 1.4 and 33 μM after the first and last injections of 10 μL,
respectively.

Figure 6 Plot (A): heat evolved
in the 1st (□), 10th (dark gray),
and 28th (light gray) addition of RIF to liposomes prepared from POPC
as a function of the lipid concentration in the cell; the lines are
the best fit of eqs 1 and 2. The dependence of KP (■, □) and ΔH°
(symbols in light gray) on the concentration of RIF in the cell (extent
of titration) is shown in plot (B) considering the heat evolved due
to each RIF addition (open symbols) or the cumulative heat from the
first injection to that being considered (filled symbols).

The enthalpy variation associated with the partition
of RIF from
the aqueous media to the POPC bilayer does not change significantly
with the concentration of RIF in the range studied, with only a small
decrease (from −6 kJ/mol at concentrations below 10 μM
to −5.1 kJ/mol at the highest concentration considered).

The values obtained for the partition coefficient and enthalpy
variation using the new method are not in quantitative agreement with
those obtained by the usual method, Figure 2. It is however important to stress that
the two methods lead to nonequivalent conditions, which may affect
the results obtained. The titration shown in Figure 2 was obtained with a total concentration
of RIF in the cell equal to 10 μM and a total concentration
of POPC in the syringe equal to 20 mM with 10 μL injections.
After the first injection, the concentration of POPC in the cell is
equal to 140 μM, all being considered accessible to the solute
(γ = 1). The calculated local concentration of RIF in the membrane
is equal to 1% (POPC/RIFM = 95) after the first lipid addition
and decreases to 0.2 (POPC/RIFM = 484) at the end of the
titration. The different parameters obtained from the two methods
used may be due to a significant perturbation of the POPC bilayer
at the beginning of the titration when following the most common method.
It is important to stress that when using that method membrane perturbation
is most significant at the beginning of the titration and will affect
the results obtained throughout the titration. In contrast, when following
the method proposed in this work, membrane perturbation is most likely
to occur at the end of the titration, when higher solute concentrations
are attained.

The affinity of Rifampicin for liposomes (representative
of bacterial
membranes; enriched in PE and PG,22,23 POPE/POPC/POPG
5:3:2) is much lower than that for pure POPC membranes. This is evident
in both the smaller partition coefficient and the unfavorable enthalpy
variation obtained for the ternary lipid mixture. These results are
partially due to repulsion between the negatively charged RIF (−0.24)
and the negative POPE/POPC/POPG membrane. However, this repulsion
is expected to be small due to the high ionic strength used. The lower
affinity for the ternary lipid mixture may also be due to the higher
lateral density and order of these membranes due to the presence of
large amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol.22 These lipids interact with each other by hydrogen
bonds, in contrast with phosphatidylcholines, which only possess acceptor
groups and are therefore unable to interact with each other by H-bonds.
In fact, the main transition temperature (from gel to fluid) of POPC
is equal to −3 °C,29 whereas
that of POPE is 26 °C.30 Although
POPG lipids may interact with each other by hydrogen bonds, this is
counterbalanced by electrostatic repulsion between the negatively
charged head groups, and the phase transition temperature of pure
POPG is 1 °C.31 When POPG is mixed
with uncharged lipids, the charge repulsion is smaller and the more
packed gel phase is stabilized, this being particularly relevant for
mixtures with phosphatidylethanolamine lipids.32 The phase diagram for this ternary mixture is not known,
but at the temperature used in this work (25 °C), this membrane
is expected to be in the fluid phase, although more ordered and densely
packed than the pure POPC membrane.

Conclusions
In
this work, a methodology is proposed in which the association
of solutes and lipid bilayers may be characterized from the titration
of the lipid with the solute. One advantage of this approach is the
possibility of achieving higher lipid concentrations, permitting the
characterization of the association of solutes with low affinity toward
the membrane. Another important advantage is that each lipid concentration
corresponds to an independent titration, avoiding, in this way, artifacts
from eventual membrane perturbation by the solute. In the usual protocol,
the local concentration of solute in the membrane is higher at the
beginning of the titration, and if the solute affects the properties
of the membrane, this will propagate to all titration points with
unpredictable effects on the heat profile obtained. In the methodology
proposed in this work, the concentration of solute is progressively
increased in each titration, which allows evaluating the effect of
the solute concentration on its affinity for the membrane. This effect
may also be characterized through the use of distinct solute concentrations
following the usual protocol.5,6 A major advantage of
this method is that smaller local concentrations of solute are characterized
first, in contrast with the usual protocol where the local concentration
of the solute is higher at the beginning of the titrations.

An important characteristic of the method proposed in this work
is that the membrane is not significantly diluted during each titration
experiment. In contrast, when following the usual protocol, the membranes
are at a very high concentration in the syringe and are diluted into
the ITC cell. If the membrane contains molecules with intermediate
affinity toward the lipid bilayer (such as the products of lipid hydrolysis),
the fraction associated with the membrane varies significantly as
the lipid concentration is changed. In fact, the usual protocol may
only be used with very pure synthetic lipids as otherwise a high and
complex (not constant throughout the titration) heat of dilution is
obtained, which masks the heat evolved due to the titration of the
relevant solute. In contrast, the method proposed in this work is
compatible with the use of very complex systems, such as cell membranes
or even whole cells.

Materials and Methods
POPC, POPG,
and POPE were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster,
Alabama, and all other reagents and solvents were of highest commercially
available purity from Sigma-Aldrich Química S.A., Sintra, Portugal.
Rifampicin 99.95% was from Parafarm, Argentina.

Aqueous suspensions
of lipids were prepared by evaporating a solution
of the lipid in chloroform/methanol (87:13, v/v) by blowing dry nitrogen
over the heated (blowing hot air over the external surface of the
tube) solution and then leaving the residue in a vacuum desiccator
for at least 8 h at 23 °C. The solvent-free residue was then
hydrated with Tris buffer, 10 mM, pH = 7.4 with 0.15 M sodium chloride,
1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.02% NaN3 (aqueous
solution). The hydrated lipid was subjected to several cycles of vortex/incubation
at the specified temperature for at least 1 h to produce a suspension
of multilamellar vesicles that were subjected to three cycles of freeze
and thaw (with an extrusion step between each cycle) as further extruded
with a minimum of 10 passes, through two stacked polycarbonate filters
(Nucleopore) with a pore diameter of 0.1 μm.33 The final phospholipid concentration was determined using
a modified version of the Bartlett phosphate assay.34

Titrations were performed on a VP-ITC from MicroCal
(Northampton,
MA) at 25 °C, with injection speed 0.5 μL/s, stirring speed
459 rpm, and reference power 10 μcal/s. The titration was performed
with additions of 10 μL/step. Depending on the method followed,
the lipid/solute was either in the syringe or in the cell. All solutions
were previously degassed for 10 min. All titrations have been performed
at 25 °C.

The obtained thermogram was integrated using
data analysis software
Origin 7.0 as modified by Microcal to deal with ITC experiments, and eqs 1 and 2 were fitted to the resulting differential titration curve using
Microsoft Excel and Solver. The concentrations in the cell were calculated
taken into account the volume that overflows the cell due to the addition
of solution from the syringe, considering that overflow is faster
than mixing. The predicted heat evolved in the titration step i is calculated by eq 1 to 3. The molar volume considered for
the lipids was 0.756 dm3/mol.35 It was considered that only the lipid in the outer leaflet of the
liposomes is accessible to Rifampicin during the time scale of the
experiments.
