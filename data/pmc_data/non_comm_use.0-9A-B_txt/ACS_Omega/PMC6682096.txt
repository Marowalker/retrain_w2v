A number of nature-derived
biologically active compounds comprise
glycosides. In some cases, the glycosidic residue is needed for bioactivity;
however, in other cases, glycosylation just improves some pharmacokinetic/dynamic
parameters. The patterns of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)
and human monoamine oxidase A (hMAO-A) inhibition by rubrofusarin
6-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (1), rubrofusarin 6-O-β-d-gentiobioside
(2), rubrofusarin triglucoside (3), and
cassiaside B2 (4) were compared with the aglycone, rubrofusarin,
isolated from Cassia obtusifolia seeds.
Rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition against the PTP1B enzyme (IC50; 16.95 ± 0.49 μM), and its glycosides reduced
activity (IC50; 87.36 ± 1.08 μM for 1 and >100 μM for 2–4) than
did the reference drug, ursolic acid (IC50; 2.29 ±
0.04 μM). Similarly, in hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin displayed
the most potent activity with an IC50 value of 5.90 ±
0.99 μM, which was twice better than the reference drug, deprenyl
HCl (IC50; 10.23 ± 0.82 μM). An enzyme kinetic
and molecular docking study revealed rubrofusarin to be a mixed-competitive
inhibitor of both these enzymes. In a western blot analysis, rubrofusarin
increased glucose uptake significantly and decreased the PTP1B expression
in a dose-dependent manner in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, increased
the expression of phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt) and phosphorylated
insulin receptor substrate-1 (p-IRS1) (Tyr 895), and decreased the
expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPCK), key enzymes of gluconeogenesis. Our overall
results show that glycosylation retards activity; however, it reduces
toxicity. Thus, Cassia seed as functional food and
rubrofusarin as a base can be used for the development of therapeutic
agents against comorbid diabetes and depression.

==== Body
Introduction
A number of glycosides
derived from natural sources are biologically
active. Glycosylation, in some cases, is essential for activity; however,
in other cases, glycosidic residue merely improves some pharmacokinetic
parameters. Recently, molecular glycobiology has contributed to a
better understanding of the activities of aglycone and glycoside.
The significant difference in activity between aglycone and glycosides
has created a new platform to develop more potent and/or more effective
glycodrugs.1 Despite that, it is nearly
impossible to generalize how the specific pattern of biological activities
of the glycosides differs from that of aglycones.2

The structural diversity and function of natural
products have
been the recent focus of drug research and drug discovery with a routine
evaluation of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion-toxicity
(ADMET) and drug-likeness of secondary metabolites from natural sources.
Interestingly, glycosylation has been found to modulate these properties.
Furthermore, glycosylation of natural products alters the water solubility,
bioavailability, and pharmacological activities, which provides a
challenge as well as passion in developing and applying glycosylated
natural products in modern medicine.3 Previous
studies have reported that the amino sugars must have a natural α-glycoside
linkage with the aglycone for antitumor activity, which the β-analogs
lacked.4 Similarly, another study on some
vitamins found more advantages from glycosylated vitamins than from
the aglycone ones. Glycosylation increased water solubility (especially
the lipophilic ones), increased stability against heat, ultraviolet
light, and oxidation, masked bitter taste and odor (e.g., thiamine),
and improved resistance to enzymatic action.2

Among various natural glycosides, flavonoid glycosides have
gained
much attention. In a comparative study of the effect of icaritin and
its glycosides (icariin and icariside II) on the differentiation and
proliferation of osteoblasts in vitro, aglycones demonstrated more
potent activity than glycoside derivatives.5 Although icariin and icariside II showed activity on streptozotocin-induced
diabetic retinopathy in vivo,6 a recent
study by Kim et al.7 stated that the activity
of two metabolites, icariside II and icaritin, is responsible for
the overall in vivo effects of icariin because, in the small intestine,
icariin is hydrolyzed to icariside II and icaritin by human intestinal
microflora.8 In our recent study on how
natural naringenin derivatives affect protein tyrosine phosphate 1B
(PTP1B) inhibition and glucose uptake, a single-glucose-containing
flavanone glycoside (prunin) showed the most potent activity among
other glycosides and an aglycone, naringenin.9 Sugars attached to specific positions with definite orientations
on the aglycone core of natural compounds are the eminent source of
structural biodiversity within natural products. Generally, these
sugars play a vital role in the molecular recognition of its cellular
target.4 The nature, its position, and
orientation of the sugar residue may increase the absorption of particular
compounds in the small intestine. However, many studies have reported
aglycones to have greater biological effects than the glycosides.10

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic
disease resulting
from insulin resistance, in which, although enough insulin is produced,
cells fail to respond to it; so, glucose uptake in tissues declines
and the blood glucose level elevates.11 PTP1B is a negative regulator of insulin signaling that catalyzes
the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate.
Further, studies on molecular biology have demonstrated inhibition
on tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor
substrate-1 (IRS-1) due to PTP1B overexpression, thereby enhancing
serine phosphorylation and finally leading to insulin resistance.
In addition, insulin sensitivity was enhanced via PTP1B knockout from
liver, muscles, and fat tissues.12 Therefore,
PTP1B is considered a target for insulin-sensitizing drugs in preventing
and treating T2DM. Similarly, the liver is a center for hepatic gluconeogenesis
catalyzed by two key enzymes, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) and phosphoenol
pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK); insulin inhibits the activity of these
enzymes and finally blocks gluconeogenesis,13,14 controlling the blood glucose level. Therefore, either increasing
the sensitivity of insulin-resistant cells toward insulin to increase
glucose uptake or inhibiting the enzyme activities of PEPCK and G6Pase
or both could be a better way to treat T2DM and associated complications.

Human monoamine oxidase (hMAO) is a metalloenzyme that catalyzes
the oxidative deamination of various bioamines, and its inhibitors
were the first developed antidepressants. Since the major depressive
disorder is estimated to be the second leading cause of diseases worldwide,
the discovery of inhibitors of two isozymes of MAO (MAO-A and MAO-B),
which differ in sensitivity toward inhibitors and substrate specificity,15 creates a sense of urgency. At present, the
association between T2DM and depression has been a subject of focus.
Some studies argue that there is a solid association between depression
and incidence of T2DM and a weak alliance between diabetes and risk
of depression,16,17 and some stick with a conclusion
that diabetics have a 2–4-fold greater risk of depression.18 On the same note, some authors have concluded
the relationship between diabetes and depression as bidirectional.19 So the discovery of dual hMAO-A and PTP1B inhibitors
from natural sources might be a promising strategy to treat comorbid
diabetes and depression.

Cassia obtusifolia Linn seed is
one of the most popular traditional Chinese medicines. It has been
used for decades because of its inherent antifungal, antioxidant,
antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, antiglycation, and antihepatotoxic properties.20−22 Recent in vivo experiments in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice
demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of Cassia seed caused significant reduction in blood glucose, total cholesterol,
triglyceride, phospholipids, and free fatty acid,23 whereas the n-butanol fraction showed
a beneficial effect on postprandial blood glucose control.24 In our previous study, we evaluated the anti-Alzheimer’s
disease activity25,26 and antidiabetic potentials27 of major anthraquinones, naphthopyrones, and
naphthalene glycosides from C. obtusifolia seeds. Recently, we have reported the hepatoprotective property
of anthraquinone and naphthopyrone glycosides from the n-BuOH fraction28 as well as the EtOAc
fraction29 of Cassia seed
in a t-BHP-treated HepG2 cell model. In this study,
we aimed to evaluate the inhibitory activity of rubrofusarin against
PTP1B and hMAO-A, set forth its enzyme kinetics, and simulate a molecular
docking study. In addition, glucose uptake activity was assessed in
insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, and the mechanism of action was explored
via cell signaling. We also made an attempt to explore how PTP1B and
hMAO-A are inhibited by glycosylation by naturally occurring naphthopyrone
glycosides from the seeds of C. obtusifolia and discuss the effect of glycosylation.

Results
Protein Tyrosine
Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and Human Monoamine
Oxidase A (hMAO-A) Inhibition
The methanol extract of C. obtusifolia seeds and its components were evaluated
for their inhibitory potential against PTP1B and hMAO-A in vitro.
As shown in Table 1, the methanol extract potently inhibited PTP1B with an IC50 value of 14.79 ± 0.31 μg/mL.27 Among rubrofusarin and its glycosides (Figure 1), rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition
of the PTP1B enzyme with an IC50 of value 16.95 ±
0.49 μM. In contrast, glycosides showed much less inhibition.
The 50% inhibition concentration for the PTP1B enzyme was 87.36 ±
1.08 μM for 1 as compared with the reference compound,
ursolic acid (IC50; 2.29 ± 0.04 μM). However,
an increase in the number of glucose molecules retarded the activity
significantly (IC50; >100 μM) in compounds 2–4 containing two, three, and four glucose
molecules, respectively.

glycosides.

Similarly,
in hMAO-A inhibition, the MeOH extract displayed moderate
inhibition with an IC50 value of 14.79 ± 0.31 μg/mL.
Rubrofusarin displayed the most potent activity with an IC50 value of 5.90 ± 0.99 μM, which was twice better than
the reference drug, deprenyl HCl (IC50; 10.23 ± 0.82
μM). 1 and 2 bearing single and double
glucose moieties did not show notable effect up to 100 μM. However,
further increase in the number of glucose moiety displayed a mild
activity by 3 (IC50; 85.50 ± 1.92 μM)
and a moderate one by 4 (IC50; 40.57 ±
0.75 μM). In both enzymes, rubrofusarin showed potent inhibition;
however, inhibition by glycosides showed a reversed pattern in these
enzymes.

Enzyme Kinetics in PTP1B and hMAO-A Inhibition
To find
out the mode of enzyme inhibition and the enzyme inhibition constant
(Ki) of the enzyme–inhibitor complex,
we carried out a kinetic study of rubrofusarin against PTP1B and hMAO-A
enzymes using Lineweaver–Burk plots and secondary plots (Supporting
Information Figure S1). The results showed
a mixed-competitive mode of PTP1B (Kic: 6.99 μM; Kiu: 18.31 μM)
and hMAO-A (Kic: 4.92 μM; Kiu: 5.96 μM) inhibition for rubrofusarin
(Table 1).

Molecular Docking
Simulation in PTP1B and hMAO-A Inhibition
Based on the molecular
docking studies, we evaluated the binding-site-directed
PTP1B and hMAO-A inhibition by rubrofusarin using AutoDock 4.2 (Figure 2). As shown in Table 2, binding energies
for rubrofusarin to the catalytic and allosteric sites of PTP1B were
−5.47 and −6.41 kcal/mol, respectively. Similarly, rubrofusarin
shared the same hydrophobic interacting residues, Tyr46 via π–π
stacked interaction, and Ala217 via π-alkyl interaction with
the catalytic inhibitor, 3-({5-[(N-acetyl-3-{4-[(carboxycarbonyl)(2-carboxyphenyl)amino]-1-naphthyl}-l-alanyl)amino]pentyl}oxy)-2-naphthoic acid (compound 23) (Figure 2A-a2). At the allosteric site, it shared two common residues, Ala189
and Leu192, via π–alkyl interaction with the allosteric
inhibitor, 3-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoyl)-2-ethyl-benzofuran-6-sulfonic
acid (4-sulfamoyl-phenyl)-amide (compound 2) (Figure 2A-a3). Furthermore,
the common H-bond interacting residues for rubrofusarin and reference
inhibitors were Asn193 at the allosteric site and Asp48 and Lys120
at the catalytic site.

van der Waals interactions with FAD (Figure 2B-b3). At the allosteric site (Figure 2B-b2), rubrofusarin bound with
−5.60 kcal/mol energy, forming five H-bonds with Gly404, Gln296,
Leu298, and Met300. Besides this, π–alkyl interactions
with Ala302 and Pro299 were also observed at the allosteric site.
Though the mode of inhibition was identified as a mixed one, secondary
plots and docking results specified it as a mixed-competitive inhibition.
The overall results of the enzyme kinetic study revealed rubrofusarin
as a mixed-competitive-dual inhibitor of PTP1B and hMAO-A.

Effect
of Glucose Moiety on Cytotoxicity in HepG2 Cells
To find
out the effect of glycosylation on the cytotoxicity in HepG2
cells, we evaluated cell viability using an MTT assay. As shown in Figure 3A, all glycosides
depicted no toxicity up to 100 μM. However, rubrofusarin showed
toxicity at 100 μM.

± standard deviation of triplicate experiments.

Effects of Rubrofusarin on Glucose Uptake
in Insulin-Resistant
HepG2 Cells
A 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxyglucose
(2-NBDG) test was used to measure the glucose uptake in insulin-resistant
HepG2 cells. Rubrofusarin increased insulin-stimulated 2-NBDG uptake
in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells significantly in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 3B).
The relative glucose uptake percentages of rubrofusarin at 12.5, 25,
and 50 μM concentrations were 68.54, 81.27, and 98.47%, respectively.
Rosiglitazone, which was used as a reference drug, increased insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake significantly to 118.52% on average at 10 μM
concentration. Since our PTP1B enzyme assay showed negligible inhibition
by glycosides, we did not perform a glucose uptake assay for those
glycosides.

Effect of Rubrofusarin on the PTP1B Expression
Level in Insulin-Resistant
HepG2 Cells
PTP1B is a negative regulator of insulin signaling,
and its high expression is implicated in insulin resistance. Therefore,
to confirm whether rubrofusarin increases insulin sensitivity by inhibiting
PTP1B expression, we evaluated the expression in insulin-resistant
HepG2 cells by western blot. As shown in Figure 4A, rubrofusarin inhibited PTP1B expression
in a dose-dependent manner, disclosing its insulin-sensitizing potential.

Figure 4 Effect
of rubrofusarin on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B)
expression in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells (A). Western blotting
was performed, and protein band intensities were quantified by densitometric
analysis. The upper panels display representative blots. Equal protein
loading was ensured and normalized against β-actin levels. Values
are the mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments; ###p < 0.001 indicates
significant differences from the control group; **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 indicate significant
differences from the 10–6 M insulin-treated control
group. Similarly, (B) represents the effects of rubrofusarin on the
levels of total and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1),
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt) as
well as on two key enzymes for gluconeogenesis, glucose-6-phosphatase
(G6Pase) and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), in insulin-resistant
HepG2 cells.

Effects of Rubrofusarin
on the IRS-1/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway
in Insulin-Resistant HepG2 Cells
The expression levels of
proteins involved in insulin signaling were measured by western blotting
to explore the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of rubrofusarin.
As shown in Figure 4B, rubrofusarin dose-dependently increased the expression of total
IRS-1 and p-IRS-1 (Tyr 895) in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, and
the levels were like those observed in normal control cells sensitive
to insulin. Furthermore, rubrofusarin significantly in a dose-dependent
manner increased the relative abundances of p-PI3K and p-Akt. Rosiglitazone
was used as a reference drug in our experiment. These findings indicate
that rubrofusarin increased insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant
HepG2 cells via upregulating the expressions of total IRS-1 and p-IRS-1
of tyrosine residue and activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

Effect of Rubrofusarin on PEPCK and G6Pase Expression Levels
in Insulin-Resistant HepG2 Cells
To investigate the effect
of rubrofusarin on the expression of genes of gluconeogenesis, we
evaluated the expression levels of two key enzymes of gluconeogenesis,
PEPCK, and G6Pase, in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. The western blot
result (Figure 4B)
showed that rubrofusarin was able to downregulate the expressions
of PEPCK and G6Pase, implying that rubrofusarin mimics the ability
of insulin in regulating these enzymes.

Drug-likeness and ADME
Prediction
Drug-likeness was
predicted for rubrofusarin and its predominant glycoside 2, which suggested that rubrofusarin has good druglike properties,
as it followed the MDDR and Lipinski’s rule (Supporting Information Table 1). In the case of 2, though
it showed a druglike property according to the MDDR-like rule,30 it did not obey Lipinski’s rule.31 ADME prediction results revealed a good percentage
of plasma protein binding (85.78%), a high percentage of human intestinal
absorption (HIA) (93.22%), and good lipophilicity with log Po/w values of 2.89. The blood–brain barrier
(BBB) penetration value ([brain]/[blood]) of rubrofusarin was 0.64,
whereas the value for 2 was too low (0.03). Since human
epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and Madin–Darby
canine kidney cells are commonly used in vitro methods to assess intestinal
permeability in early drug discovery, we also predicted the permeabilites
of rubrofusarin and 2 in these cell models. Results showed
higher permeability for rubrofusarin than 2. All of these
predicted results will be helpful for the optimization of druglike
properties.

Discussion
These days, for the treatment
of T2DM, several approaches to enzyme
inhibition, enhanced insulin secretion, and sensitivity along with
gluconeogenesis inhibition have been considered.32 By continuous search for natural PTP1B inhibitors from
natural resources, about 300 inhibitors have been discovered.33 However, along with concerns about the development
of PTP1B inhibitors, high structural conservation and toxicity have
become a barrier.34 Most of the natural
compounds exist as aglycone and glycoside conjugates simultaneously,
and despite the high activity of aglycones, their toxicity at certain
concentrations has forced advances in glycoscience.

Glycosylation
is a natural route for the development of new therapeutic
carriers for site-specific drug delivery because of its reduced toxicity
and high absorption cum bioavailability.35 To compare the toxicity of aglycone to that of its glycosides, we
performed a cytotoxicity assay in HepG2 cells. Glycosides reduced
the cytotoxicity as well as PTP1B enzyme inhibition. Rubrofusarin
was nontoxic up to a 50 μM concentration; however, its glycosides
showed no toxicity even at 100 μM. Most of the natural glycosides
are hydrolyzed in the human intestine by the β-glucosidase enzyme,
cleaving the glycosidic bond and resulting aglycone moiety. The role
of intracellular-glycosidase is difficult to assess, but we suspect
that rubrofusarin glycosides, when taken orally, are deglycosylated/hydrolyzed
by intestinal enzymes, such as β-glucosidase, in the small intestine,
into rubrofusarin. In C. obtusifolia seeds, rubrofusarin gentiobioside is present abundantly, and it
can be provided in various forms, such as foods and drinks, seasonings,
alcoholic beverages, functional foods, and medicinal products for
oral consumption.36 Being a dominant component
in Cassia seeds, rubrofusarin gentiobioside, because
of some of its inherent properties, like hydrophilicity, high stability
to pH and light, and lack of toxicity at relatively higher concentration,
could be useful as a medicinal entity. High hydrophilicity of glycosides
makes them satisfactorily soluble in the gastrointestinal juice, which
are hydrolyzed into absorbable aglycones. To optimize pharmacokinetic
properties in a drug discovery program especially in light of typical
constraints on in vivo resources, in vitro screens should be utilized,
which could serve as an effective tool to triage and prioritize compounds
for in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Furthermore, characterization
of ADME properties and evaluation of drug-likeness are the first steps
in drug discovery. Therefore, we predicted the ADME properties and
drug-likeness of our active compound, rubrofusarin, and compared it
with its glycoside, 2. As in our result, HIA of rubrofusarin
was much higher than its glycoside, 2 (93.22 vs 13.23%).
Although 2 was predicted to be druglike from the MDDR-like
rule, it violated Lipinski’s rule and also the ADME properties
were not satisfactory. However, rubrofusarin was predicted to be druglike
with improved ADME properties, as shown in Supporting Information Table 1. Similarly, in the PTP1B enzyme assay
of this study, glycosides showed marked reduction in activity. Regardless
of their reduced activity, we presume they are active in vivo because
these glycosides might be metabolized to the active aglycone in the
gut/intestine. However, whether the intake of Cassia seed leads to blood or tissue concentration range of IC50 value of our study is yet to be explored. Our ADME prediction result
obtained from PreADMET demonstrated good results for rubrofusarin
(PPB: 85.78%; BBB: 0.64) unlike 2 (PPB: 34.48%; BBB:
0.03). Recently, a clinical trial conducted to evaluate safety and
beneficial effects of Cassia seed supplementation
(330 mg × 3 times a day) in healthy adults demonstrated no change
in biological safety markers.37 So it is
worth performing in vivo studies of Cassia seed extract
and determine blood/tissue concentration of rubrofusarin as well as
a high but safe dose of its glycosides to compare them with the activity
of aglycone.

The pattern of PTP1B and hMAO-A inhibition was
quite interesting
in our study. Rubrofusarin showed potent effect against these enzymes,
but glycosylation reduced the activity. Unlike the reduced activity
of glycosides on PTP1B, highly glycosylated compounds 3 and 4 showed reoccurrence of activity on the hMAO-A
enzyme. Whether the activities of 3 and 4 are real indeed or it is the result of the masking effect of long
sugar chain remains unexplored. Since only rubrofusarin showed potent
PTP1B and hMAO-A inhibition, we worked more on understanding the kinetics
and molecular docking. The cell signaling mechanism for PTP1B inhibition
and glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cell was also explored.
Enzyme kinetics studies have become an essential component of investigating
drug action or characterizing inhibitors. To characterize the mode
of PTP1B and hMAO-A enzyme inhibition, the double reciprocal Lineweaver–Burk
plots and secondary plots were used. From the kinetic results, rubrofusarin
showed the mixed mode of inhibition because increasing the concentration
of the compound resulted in a family of lines with different slopes
and intercepts, but they intersected one another in the second quadrant.
This behavior shows that rubrofusarin can bind not only with the free
enzyme but also with the enzyme–substrate complex. In enzymatic
reactions and, definitely, for their inhibition, ligand binding is
the key step. Hence, understanding the interactions between small
molecules and proteins in detail may form a base for rational drug
design. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of enzyme inhibition
is of crucial importance in biomedical research.38 Molecular docking has been a good tool to elucidate the
mechanistic pathway. To confirm the kinetics result, and to investigate
the mechanisms of interaction between the inhibitor and the active
sites of PTP1B and hMAO-A, we performed a molecular docking study.
Rubrofusarin shared common hydrophobic interacting residues Tyr46
and Ala217 with compound 23 at the catalytic site via
π–π stacked and π–alkyl interactions,
respectively. Similarly, sharing the same residues with compound 2 through π–π stacked, π–alkyl,
and π–σ interactions, rubrofusarin displayed allosteric
inhibition of PTP1B. The docking results of the PTP1B–rubrofusarin
complex revealed that rubrofusarin was stably positioned in both the
catalytic and allosteric domains of the PTP1B residue, with most of
the shared interacting residues being the same as in the reference
ligands; however, in comparison, the shared number of hydrophobic
interacting residues at the allosteric site was greater.

For
hMAO-A inhibition, rubrofusarin bound to the enzyme targets
via π–alkyl interactions with Ile180 and Ile335, π–π
stacking with Tyr407, and π–π T-shaped and van
der Waals interactions with FAD at the catalytic site to provide further
stability to the complexes. In addition, the modeling predicted π–alkyl
interaction with Ala302 and H-bond interaction with Met300 as a principal
mechanism for allosteric inhibition. Furthermore, binding affinity
toward the catalytic site overweighed the allosteric site as indicated
by the binding energy (−9.67 kcal/mol for the catalytic site
and −5.60 kcal/mol for the allosteric site), which denotes
that the inhibition was mixed but toward the catalytic site of the
hMAO-A enzyme.

Inhibition of PTP1B is a recognized therapeutic
approach for the
management of T2DM and its associated complications. Protein tyrosine
phosphatases downregulate the cellular signal transduction mediated
by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the insulin receptor and the
epidermal growth factor receptor.39 PTP1B
is thought to function as a negative regulator of insulin signal transduction
and has been implicated in the negative regulation of IR and IRS-1
within the insulin-stimulated signal-transduction pathway.40,41 Thus, drug entities with PTP1B inhibition have insulin-sensitizing
potential and prolong insulin action for the management of T2DM.

Insulin-resistant cells, compared with normal cells, are better
in an vitro model to investigate type 2 diabetes because, to use normal
cells, many parameters related to glucose metabolism must be altered.
In our study, we used insulin-resistant HepG2 to evaluate the glucose
uptake potential of rubrofusarin along with its role in the insulin
transduction pathway. Increased glucose uptake in insulin-resistant
cells treated with samples, as compared with the untreated insulin-resistant
group, confirms the improvement of insulin sensitivity. The result
of a 2-NBDG assay showed that rubrofusarin could increase the insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly,
in western blot analysis for PTP1B expression, rubrofusarin at 50
μM concentration significantly reduced the expression.

Binding of insulin to its receptor results in the phosphorylation
of IRS-1 at the tyrosine residue and finally activates PI3K. IRS-1
is the first receptor protein that is cloned and plays a vital role
in insulin-stimulated cell signaling.42 Activation of PI3K/Akt upon binding insulin to its receptor increases
the transportation of glucose from the blood to cells. However, if
there is insulin resistance, the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at the tyrosine
residue is downregulated, causing blockade of PI3K/Akt signaling.
The expression and activity of PTP1B elevate in hyperglycemic liver,
which impairs IR/IRS1-mediated insulin signaling by increasing the
association of IR with this phosphatase. The result from our western
blot analysis showed greater expressions of IRS-1, p-IRS-1 (Tyr 895),
p-Akt, and p-PI3K in insulin-resistant HepG2 upon rubrofusarin treatment,
leading to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. These modulations
in insulin-signaling pathways restored hepatic IR/IRS1-associated
PI3K activity in response to insulin and markedly improved insulin
sensitivity and glucose uptake. Taken together, these results demonstrate
that hyperglycemia impairs insulin signaling via increasing the expression
level and activity of PTP1B and that inhibition of PTP1B activity
by the specific PTP1B inhibitor rubrofusarin may provide a potential
effective therapeutic strategy for rescuing the impaired insulin signaling
under diabetic condition.

The rate of gluconeogenesis in type
2 diabetic patients is higher
than in nondiabetic ones.43 G6Pase and
PEPCK are the two key enzymes responsible for hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Therefore, inhibiting the activity of these two enzymes definitely
halts or reduces glucose formation in diabetic patients. Insulin is
the drug that suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis.44 When the cells are resistant to insulin, the rate of hepatic
gluconeogenesis elevates. Therefore, suppression of hepatic glucose
production leads to the management of diabetes. In this regard, we
evaluated the effect of rubrofusarin on these two enzymes, and western
blot result showed dose-dependent suppression by rubrofusarin of the
expressions of G6Pase and PEPCK.

Diabetic people frequently
have depressive disorders along with
significant levels of depressive symptoms.45 A recent study by Sakimura et al.46 explored
the reduced level of serotonin in spontaneously diabetic Torii fatty
rat, concluding this animal as an appropriate model for diabetes with
comorbid depression associated with impaired neurotransmitter. A number
of pieces of evidence suggest a deficit in the serotonergic system
as one underlying pathophysiology of depression. In addition, the
mechanism of antidepressant action is generally based on MAO-A inhibition
and consequently the ability to counter the reduced serotonin level.
Even though the American Psychiatric Association and the British Association
for Psychopharmacology consider MAO inhibitors as a second choice
following serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors,47 discovery of natural
dual MAO-A/PTP1B inhibitors will be an asset for drug discovery against
comorbid diabetes and depression. Our overall result indicates that
rubrofusarin is a dual inhibitor of PTP1B and hMAO-A, stimulates glucose
uptake, reduces the expression of hepatic enzymes of gluconeogenesis,
decreases PTP1B expression, and activates the insulin-signaling pathway
in
insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, demonstrating the utmost importance
of in vivo studies to determine the blood/tissue concentration of
rubrofusarin and a high but safe dose of its glycosides to compare
with the activity of aglycone.

In summary, our study extends
the knowledge on rubrofusarin showing
its potential in inhibiting hMAO-A and PTP1B, promoting glucose uptake
in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, and activating PI3K/Akt through
p-IRS-1 tyrosine 895 phosphorylation in insulin-signaling and -suppressing
key enzymes of gluconeogenesis in vitro. In addition, glycosylation
of rubrofusarin reduces toxicity in HepG2 cells. Most importantly,
our findings introduce Cassia seeds as a functional
food and rubrofusarin as a new class of phytochemicals with hMAO-A-inhibiting
and insulin-sensitizing activity. Therefore, these compounds may have
potential in treating insulin resistance and T2DM with comorbid depression.
However, further in vivo studies must be conducted for a comparative
study of rubrofusarin and its glycosides along with the determination
of blood/tissue concentration of rubrofusarin after ingestion of Cassia seed for the validation of our findings.

Plant Material
Raw seeds of C. obtusifolia were purchased (Omni Herb Co.) and identified by Prof. J.-H. Lee
(Dongguk University, Gyeongju). A voucher specimen (No. 20160302)
was registered and deposited in the Prof. J. S. Choi laboratory (Pukyong
National University, Busan).

Extraction, Fractionation, and Isolation
The MeOH extract
(209.92 g), obtained by refluxing 2.0 kg of dried seeds of C. obtusifolia in MeOH for 3 h (3 × 5 L), was
suspended in distilled water and successively partitioned with dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and n-butanol (n-BuOH) to yield CH2Cl2 (33.21 g), EtOAc (14.72 g), and n-BuOH (63.36 g) fractions, respectively, and a final H2O residue (94.28 g). The n-BuOH fraction was subjected
to Diaion HP 20 resin column chromatography using H2O/MeOH
(100:0 → 0:100 gradient) and finally acetone to obtain five
subfractions. The 60% MeOH subfraction (25.77 g) was then subjected
to Si gel column chromatography to yield 11 subfractions (M1–M11).
Subfraction M6 (1.17 g) was further chromatographed on a Si gel column
(3 × 80 cm2) employing EtOAc–MeOH–H2O (30:2:1) as an eluent, and eight subfractions were obtained.
Subfraction 8 was further chromatographed on a reverse phase column
using 30% acetone as the eluent to yield compound 1 (11.0
mg). In addition, M8, which had the highest yield (9.00 g), was chromatographed
over a Si gel column (3 × 80 cm2) using EtOAc–MeOH–H2O (24:3:2) as the eluent to obtain 11 subfractions. Subfraction
10 gave a yellow precipitate that recrystallized into yellow crystals,
compound 2 (250 mg). Similarly, M9 (0.78 g) was chromatographed
over a Si gel column using EtOAc–MeOH–H2O
(24:3:2) as the eluent to obtain 80 subfractions. Subfraction 80,
upon purification on a reverse phase column using 50% methanol as
the eluent, gave compound 3 (17.0 mg). Finally, subfraction
20 of M11 (1.02 g) obtained using EtOAc–MeOH–H2O (21:5:3) gave a light-green precipitate that, upon washing with
methanol, gave compound 4 (14.8 mg). All four compounds
isolated were identified spectroscopically, which included the use
of 1H- and 13C NMR, by comparing spectral data
with published values.26,48−51 The four compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were identified
as rubrofusarin 6-O-β-d-glucopyranoside,
rubrofusarin 6-O-β-d-gentiobioside,
rubrofusarin triglucoside, and cassiaside B2, respectively. The EtOAc
fraction was subjected to Si gel column chromatography using CH2Cl2–MeOH–H2O (10:1:0.1)
to yield 10 subfractions. Subfraction 1 (1.5 g) gave a precipitate
in methanol, which was filtered and further purified on a reverse
phase column using 80% methanol to give rubrofusarin (8.9 mg), as
identified by comparing the spectral data with our previous report.52 The purities of these compounds were considered
to be >98% as evidenced by proton and carbon NMR spectra.

Assay
for PTP1B and hMAO-A Inhibition
The inhibitory
activity of the methanol extract and isolated compounds against PTP1B
was measured using pNPP following the procedure reported
by Sun et al.34 with slight modifications.53 To each well of a 96-well plate (final volume
100 μL), 40 μL of PTP1B enzyme (0.5 unit diluted with
the PTP1B reaction buffer containing 50 mM citrate [pH 6.0], 0.1 M
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT) was added with or without test samples
(10 μL). The plate was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min,
and then 50 μL of 2 mM pNPP in the PTP1B reaction
buffer was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction
was terminated by the addition of 10 M NaOH. The amount of p-nitrophenyl produced by enzymatic dephosphorylation of pNPP was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm
using a microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). Ursolic acid was used as a positive control.

Similarly,
for hMAO-A inhibition, a chemiluminescent assay was performed in a
white opaque 96-well plate using the MAO-Glo kit (Promega, Madison,
WI). All of the experimental conditions and procedures followed herein
were similar to those reported in our previous paper.54 The percent of inhibition (%) was obtained by the following
equation: % inhibition = (Ac – As)/Ac × 100,
where Ac is the absorbance of the control
and As is the absorbance of the sample.

Kinetic Parameters in PTP1B and hMAO-A Inhibition: Dixon and
Lineweaver–Burk Plots
Two kinetic methods, Lineweaver–Burk
and Dixon plots, were used to find out the kinetic mechanism.55,56 The reaction mixture consisted of three different concentrations
of substrate (pNPP for PTP1B and MAO substrate for
hMAO-A) in the presence or absence of test compounds. The Michaelis–Menten
constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) for each enzyme inhibition were measured
by Lineweaver–Burk plots, and the inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated from secondary plots using
SigmaPlot 12.0 TM software (SPCC, Inc., Chicago, IL).

Molecular Docking
The docking of the target enzyme
and rubrofusarin was successfully simulated by using the AutoDock
4.2 program.57,58 X-ray crystallography of the
PTP1B-allosteric ligand compound 2 complex (PDB ID: 1T49) and the hMAO A–harmine
complex (PDB ID: 2Z5X) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) website (http://www.rcsb.org/) with resolutions
of 1.90 and 2.2 Å, respectively.59,60 The 3D structure
of rubrofusarin was obtained from PubChem Compound (NCBI), with compound
CIDs of 72537. Automated docking simulation was performed using AutoDockTools
(ADT) to assess the appropriate binding orientations and conformations
of the ligand molecules with different protein inhibitors. For the
docking calculations, Gasteiger charges were added by default, the
rotatable bonds were set by the ADT, and all torsions were allowed
to rotate. The grid maps were generated by the AutoGrid. The docking
protocol for rigid and flexible ligand docking consisted of 10 independent
genetic algorithms; the other parameters used were the ADT defaults.
The reported catalytic inhibitor compound 23 (PDB ID: 1NNY) was used to compare
the interaction residues and aspect. The results were visualized and
analyzed using Discovery Studio (v17.2, Accelrys, San Diego, CA).

Cell Culture, MTT Assay, and Insulin-Resistance Induction
The HepG2 cells were subcultured in 10% FBS MEM, and the medium
was replaced with fresh FBS MEM every 48 h until the plate was confluent
enough. The confluent cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, and cytotoxicity
was evaluated by the MTT assay.61 Similarly,
for the induction of insulin resistance in HepG2 cells, we followed
the previously reported method.62 Overall
procedures, experimental conditions, and setup have been described
in detail in our previous report.63

Glucose
Uptake Assay
The glucose uptake potential of
rubrofusarin was evaluated fluorimetrically by using fluorescent d-glucose analog, 2-NBDG (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA),
and a Synergy HT microplate reader (PerkinElmer, MA).53 The experiment was performed in triplicates, and the result
was validated using rosiglitazone (10 μM) as a reference drug.

Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis
In
brief, insulin-resistant HepG2 cells were treated with rubrofusarin
or rosiglitazone for 24 h and stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 30
min. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and lysed
with a sample buffer to extract protein. Then, aliquots of protein
were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, followed
by blocking the membrane with 10% nonfat milk (w/v) in TBST. After
that, the membrane was incubated overnight in primary antibodies and
in secondary antibody for 1 h and visualized with the Supersignal
West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) on X-ray
films (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and quantified using CS analyzer software
(Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Drug-likeness and ADME Prediction
Drug-likeness prediction
was carried out using PreADMET. This web-based server is used to calculate
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) data and
build the druglike library using an in silico method.64

Statistical Analysis
A one-way analysis
of variance
and Student’s t-test (Systat Inc., Evanston,
IL) were used to calculate the statistical significance. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be significant. All of
the results are presented as the mean ± standard error of the
mean.
