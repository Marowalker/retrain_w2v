High-thermal-conductivity
polymers are very sought after for applications
in various thermal management systems. Although improving crystallinity
is a common way for increasing the thermal conductivity (k) of polymers, it has very limited capacity when the crystallinity
is already high. In this work, by heat-stretching a highly crystalline
microfiber, a significant k enhancement is observed.
More interestingly, it coincides with a reduction in crystallinity.
The sample is a Spectra S-900 ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene
(UHMW-PE) microfiber of 92% crystallinity and high degree of orientation.
The optimum stretching condition is 131.5 °C, with a strain rate
of 0.0129 s–1 to a low strain ratio (∼6.6)
followed by air quenching. The k enhancement is from
21 to 51 W/(m·K), the highest value for UHMW-PE microfibers reported
to date. X-ray diffraction study finds that the crystallinity reduces
to 83% after stretching, whereas the crystallite size and crystallite
orientation are not changed. Cryogenic thermal characterization shows
a reduced level of phonon-defect scattering near 30 K. Polarization
Raman spectroscopy finds enhanced alignment of amorphous chains, which
could be the main reason for the k enhancement. A
possible relocation of amorphous phase is also discussed and indirectly
supported by a bending test.

1 Introduction
Polymeric
materials have been widely used in industry because of
their low cost and excellent properties, including high strength-to-weight
ratio, chemical stability, and corrosion resistance.1−3 High thermal conductivity (k) can significantly
improve polymers’ capability of heat dissipation, tolerance
to thermal impulse, and so on. Highly thermal
conductive polymers are very sought after for applications in thermal
design of flexible electronics as the substrate for excellent heat
dissipation, apparel of reduced heat stress to quickly respread the
accumulated heat from sensitive body areas, and to conduct the heat
to the environment, and as fillers to make high-performance material
interfaces used in central processing unit cooling. However, k of common synthetic polymers, including poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET), low-density polyethylene (LD-PE), polypropylene,
and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), universally falls in the range
of 0.1–0.3 W/(m·K).4−6 Attempts have been made to enhance k of polymers. Crystallinity and molecular orientation are
two key factors that influence k. Usually, higher
crystallinity leads to higher k due to the higher k of crystalline structures than amorphous structures. For
example, the room-temperature (RT) k of an 81% crystalline
PE is reported to be 70% higher than that of PE of 43% crystallinity.5 Besides crystallinity, significant k enhancement is observed with improved molecular alignment, for both
crystalline and amorphous polymers.7−11 This is commonly understood that the covalent bonds along the polymer
molecular chains sustain better energy transport than the van der
Waals interaction between neighboring chains.12 In practice, mechanical stretching is an effective way to enhance k. It has been observed that stretching improves molecular
chain alignment and increases crystallinity. Piraux et al. improved
the RT k of polyacetylene film up over 10 W/(m·K),
with an approximate 500% elongation.9 The
molecular dynamic simulation of Liu et al. suggests that both k and degree of orientation increase with increased elongation
for originally unoriented PE molecular cubes.13 The work by Kurabayashi shows that the alignment of polymer chains
could be correlated to anisotropic k of amorphous
polymers like PMMA and polycarbonate.11

The heat-stretching process of PE for the production of highly
thermal conductive fibers has been the subject of extensive research
for several decades. Some high k values (9–104
W/(m·K)) have already been achieved in laboratory,10,14−17 and k of defect-free PE chain predicted by simulation
can be as high as 350 W/(m·K).18 By
ultra-drawing, PE film’s k has been increased
from 6 to 41 W/(m·K) by Choy et al.10 Their sample, ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE)
single-crystal mat, was produced using the method of Kanamoto et al.19 and further stretched to a strain ratio of 350
with a strain rate of 0.083 s–1 at 125 °C.
The final mat thickness is 8 μm. For thermal characterization,
Choy et al. used the laser-flash radiometry technique20 at 160–300 K and steady heat flow method below 160
K. The gel-spun UHMW-PE microfibers are measured to have k ≈ 60 W/(m·K) (DSM Dyneema fiber) by Fujishiro et al.14 using steady heat flow method and k ≈ 12–17 W/(m·K) (DSM Dyneema fiber and Honeywell
Spectra fiber) by Wang et al.15 using time-domain
thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. The measured k values
in refs (10) and (14) could be overestimated
because both groups employed conventional steady-state measurement
method without subtracting the radiation effect. A considerable portion
of the measured k could come from the contribution
of heat radiation when the sample has a large length-to-diameter ratio
(the ratio is over 50 in ref (14)). The k of electrospun PE nanofibers was
measured to be 9.3 W/(m·K) by Ma et al.16 using the micromachined thermal bridge method.21 The k of PE nanofiber, picked from UHMW-PE
gel with a fine tungsten tip, was increased to an astonishing value
as high as 104 W/(m·K) by further ultra-drawing, as reported
by Shen et al.17 Their sample was elongated
to 131 nm in diameter and 290 μm in length with an estimated
draw ratio of 60–800.17 Their thermal
characterization was carried out by utilizing a bimaterial cantilever
as temperature sensor and a needle heater in high vacuum.

Recently,
our group has done systematic research on the thermal
properties of UHMW-PE fibers. Liu et al. conducted an in-depth study
on the thermal properties of UHMW-PE microfibers (Honeywell Spectra
S-900) from RT to 10 K using the transient electrothermal (TET) technique.22 Sample’s k at RT is
measured to be ∼23 W/(m·K). The defect-induced phonon
mean free path (MFP) is evaluated to be 8.06 and 9.42 nm for the two
samples under study, relatively smaller than the axial crystallite
size of 19.7 nm. This difference is attributed to extensive phonon
scatterings at grain boundaries.

To date, no other studies have
reported high k values comparable to those found
by Choy et al. and Shen et al.10,17 Also, their k improvement needs sample ultra-drawing.
In this work, we aim to improve the k of microscale
UHMW-PE fibers, which are applicable at the engineering level. By
combining well-controlled and optimized heating and stretching of
UHMW-PE crystalline fibers at a moderate level, we significantly improved
the k to the level of 50 W/(m·K), maintaining
the drawing ratio very low (∼6.6). Three groups of samples
stretched under different conditions were measured using the TET technique
from RT to 30 K. To uncover the mechanism of this significant k improvement, a thermal reffusivity study of phonon MFP
and a pole-figure X-ray diffraction (XRD) study were conducted. The
result of XRD analysis indicates a decreased crystallinity although
with a significant increase in k. The contradictory
could be attributed to the reconstruction of amorphous region, including
distribution and alignment. Further study by polarized Raman spectra
indicates enhanced amorphous alignment after heat stretching.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Heating Level
and Stretching Speed
Honeywell Spectra S-900, a commercial
UHMW-PE fiber of high tensile
modulus (73 GPa) and high crystallinity (92%), was supplied by Minifibers,
Inc. in the form of 50 mm cut. Sample thickness varies between 40
and 55 μm. The density is 0.97 g/cm3. Each sample
fiber is further cut into two parts: 40 mm, for heat stretching, and
10 mm, as reference.

Heat stretching is carried out by applying
constant temperature and constant stretching speed to sample fibers,
followed by quenching in air. The setup of the heat-stretching system
is shown in Figure 1a. The idea of the setup has come from the optical fiber tapering
method developed by Rudy and colleagues.23 Then, we apply the TET technique to measure the thermal diffusivity,
α, of stretched samples and reference samples at RT. The value
of k is obtained as k = αρCp, where ρCp is the volumetric heat capacity given
by our previous work on S-900 fiber.22 TET
is a transient thermal characterization technique that utilizes electric
current to generate and detect temperature change. The TET technique
has been proven of sound accuracy (high signal-to-noise ratio) and
reliability (no calibration required) for measuring α of a single
microfiber in a wide temperature range (10–300 K).22,24,25 It has great advantages over
the other three thermal characterization techniques for microfibers:
3-omega, TDTR, and microfabricated thermal bridge method.15,26,27 The setup for TET characterization
is presented in Figure 1b–d. A more detailed description of the heat stretching and
TET characterization is included in Supporting Information.

Figure 1 (a) Experimental setup of heat-stretching system. The
Al block
is integrated with a cartridge heater and a thermocouple sensor to
provide a constant temperature during stretching. The temperature
gradient along the sample fiber is estimated to be 10–40 K/mm,
depending on center temperature. The center temperature of the sample
fiber is measured by calibrating it to the sensor temperature (see Supporting Information). The two motorized translation
stages move at a constant speed for each run. (b) Experimental setup
for TET characterization. In a vacuum chamber (∼0.5 mTorr)
with radiation shield, the to-be-measured sample fibers are suspended between Al electrodes.
Silver paste is employed to fix the samples onto electrodes. The electrodes
are further connected to a direct current source and an oscilloscope.
Thin mica layers provide electrical insulation. The Al base (the large
electrode) is attached to the cold head by thermal grease. (c) Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of a sample prepared for TET characterization.
The sample is unstretched sample C, which will be mentioned later.
(d) Current input and voltage–time evolution for unstretched
sample C at RT.

It should be mentioned
that in the subsequent discussion on k, the error
of ρCp is not considered
in error analysis. The value of ρCp is evaluated using ρCp of crystal PE and amorphous
PE (obtained by extrapolation) from the literature.28,29 Therefore, error of ρCp is very hard to evaluate. The ρCp used in this work is nevertheless reliable
because (1) the ρCp of crystal PE is well defined by both simulation and experiment,28,29 (2) the sample used in this work is highly crystalline (83–92%),
and (3) for amorphous PE and crystal PE, the difference in ρCp is not significant (within
20% in the temperature range of 30–300 K).29

Heat stretching here covers a temperature range of
116–135
°C. The reason is that we cannot find significant elongation
and k enhancement below 116 °C. Initially, heat
stretching has been performed between RT and 90 °C in water bath.
Low-temperature stretching leads to a k enhancement
less than 4 W/(m·K), whereas k of original fibers
can vary between 19 and 22 W/(m·K). Above 135 °C, a fiber
breaks nearly without resistance to applied force. It seems the majority
of fiber content has molten, although the suspended fiber nevertheless
holds its shape before stretching, possibly due to the very long molecular
chain. The stretching speed includes three values for comparison:
6, 10, and 20 μm/s. Stretching at over 20 μm/s limits
the elongation and resultant k enhancement. The minimum
speed given by the motorized translation stages is 6 μm/s. Therefore,
the stretching conditions that are selected to present include 116–135
°C as the temperature range and 6–20 μm/s as the
speed range. Under such conditions, the strain rate is estimated to
be between 0.008 and 0.016 s–1 by measuring local
fiber width.

During the stretching process, distinct necking
appears with a
large decrease in thickness of the fiber, as shown in Figure 2a–c,e–g. Beside
the neck region is the shoulder region, which is heated at the beginning
but then gets gradually drawn away from the heated region. The rest
is stretched but not heated. The thickness of the unheated part is
identical to that of the reference samples, which are neither heated
nor stretched. The length of the neck region is 3–5 mm. The
samples as presented are three typical scenarios (samples A–C)
we study in this work. The stretching conditions of the three samples
are summarized in Table 1. The internal structure is investigated by mechanical splitting. Figure 2d,h shows the axial
cross section of a stretched sample and its reference sample, respectively.
It can be seen that the original microfiber is composed of numerous
finer fibers highly aligned in submicron scale, which somehow explains
the high k (19–22 W/(m·K)) of S-900 fiber.
After stretching under the same condition as sample A, the internal
structure remains clearly stranded and aligned as well as that of
original S-900.

For thermal characterization, we
merely sample the center (3 mm
long) of the fiber neck for stretched fibers. It is because every
sample has been elongated by 3 mm at least. The change in k of samples stretched under different conditions is presented
in Figure 3a, with
the fitting quality of thermal characterization shown in Figure 3b. There is a clear
trend that the value of k increases with increased
stretching temperature, from 116 to 131.5 °C, as highlighted
in the figure. This is due to the longer elongation by stretching
(before break) when a higher temperature is used. At 131.5 °C,
it reaches a peak. The optimal temperature (131.5 °C) is very
close to 130 °C, where Smith et al. achieved a high degree of
orientation for drawn UHMW-PE gel film (strain ratio = 130).30 Over 131.5 °C, the heated fiber seems free
from stress, but it still holds its shape probably due to the extremely
long molecular chain of UHMW-PE. The elongation at break and k improvement are smaller than those at lower stretching
temperature. For example, the sample (sample 16) stretched at 135
°C by 3.3 mm has a lower k (26.9 W/(m·K))
than sample A stretched at 131.5 °C by 5 mm. As the temperature
exceeds 135 °C, the fiber melts before being stretched. The highest k value at RT obtained here is 50.8 W/(m·K) when a
fiber is stretched at a rate of 10 μm/s at 131.5 °C (sample
A). Figure 2a,e shows
the fiber thickness before and after stretching. Sample A is of great
interest and will be studied in detail in the following sections.

Figure 3 (a) RT k of UHMW-PE fibers after being stretched
at different rates and different temperatures. Each data point is
a mean value of 20 repeated measurements. The error bar represents
three standard deviations of the mean. Besides samples A–C,
other samples are denoted by numbers 1–16. The gray zone represents
the measured k of original samples. (b) Representative
raw data for samples stretched under different conditions, including
samples 1, 3, 4, 6, A, and 16 in (a). It shows a sound signal-to-noise
ratio and fitting agreement to give a highly reliable α.

For the stretching rate effect, Figure 3a shows a weak dependence
of k on the stretching rate. We use a relatively
high stretching rate
at low temperatures, 20 μm/s. When the temperature is higher
than 124.5 °C, the faster stretching will quickly break the sample,
and is not suitable for the stretching. Therefore, a lower stretching
rate of 10 μm/s is used. This can be clearly proved by the two
stretching results at 127 °C. The two samples (samples 9 and
10) stretched at 20 μm/s at 127 °C have a much lower k than sample 11 stretched at 10 μm/s at the same
temperature. The overall elongations of these two fibers are both
3 mm, which is considerably shorter than the 5 mm elongation of the
fiber (sample 11) stretched at the same temperature with a half speed
(10 μm/s). It suggests that a high stretching speed might limit
the maximum elongation at a threshold temperature, leading to a less
improved k value. As the lower limit, 6 μm/s
is tried at 131.5 °C (sample 13). However, the k value drops significantly. A possible reason is that the lower stretching
speed provides longer time for the PE to melt, which weakens the effect
of stress.

The strain rate could be a key for the high k achieved
in this study. It is because the internal tensile stress is related
to the strain rate and a moderate level of internal tensile stress
could align molecular chains without breaking them. The strain rate
used in this work (0.008–0.016 s–1; average,
0.0129 s–1, for sample A) is close to the range
of 0.01–0.1 s–1, where optimal chain alignment,
crystallinity, and elastic modulus were found for stretched UHMW-PE
materials. Examples include 0.011, 0.033, and 0.083 s–1 for microfiber (a blend with 2 wt % LD-PE), single-crystal mat,
and single-crystal film, respectively.10,31,32

2.2 Thermal Conductivity Behavior
under Measurement
Temperature Variation
After RT thermal characterization,
sample A stretched at 131.5 °C and other two fibers stretched
at 124.5 °C (sample B) and 116 °C (sample C) are selected
for further cryogenic TET measurement. These cryogenic studies are
to provide further knowledge on how k and α
of stretched PE fibers increase over those of unstretched ones. Also,
a detailed study of the stretching ratio is conducted. Properties
and elongation details of the samples are listed in Table 1. The fiber thickness has already
been measured under SEM, as shown in Figure 2a–c,e–g.

The cryogenic
TET test gives α and k at different temperatures
from 30 to 300 K, as shown in Figure 4. The data of the stretched samples and reference samples
are compared. k is calculated according to the reported
ρCp.22 The figures show that, for the stretched and
reference samples, α decreases monotonically with increased
temperature whereas k does not. In the plots of k, a subtle decrease with increased temperature near RT
could be observed. It is due to the combination effect of increasing
ρCp and decreasing
α with increased temperature. The increase of ρCp becomes moderate near RT,
which allows k = αρCp to follow the decrease of α.
This phenomenon is also observed and studied in the literature.4−6,33 By comparing the stretched and
reference samples, it is observed that not only at RT but also at
any temperature below RT, the stretched samples have much higher k and α. To rule out the effect of difference among
unstretched fibers, we should introduce the k increase
ratio, kstr/kref, which is the k of stretched sample divided by
that of the reference sample. In Figure 5, kstr/kref is plotted against temperature. As temperature
decreases to 30 K from RT, kstr/kref increases from 2.4 to 3.3 for sample A,
from 1.5 to 2.8 for sample B, and from 1.8 to 2.5 for sample C, suggesting
a more pronounced enhancement of k under cryogenic
temperatures.

2.3 Low-Momentum Phonon MFP Improvement by Heat
Stretching
The cryogenic TET characterization suggests that
stretching UHMW-PE fibers at 10 μm/s at 131.5 °C leads
to the most significant improvement of k and α
in a wide temperature range. To unveil the mechanism behind the significant
improvement of k, phonon MFP calculation and XRD
and Raman spectroscopy analyses are employed.

The defect-induced
phonon MFP can be evaluated by thermal reffusivity Θ, reciprocal
of α, at the 0 K limit.34 The idea
is that a phonon is much more likely to be scattered by defects rather
than other phonons at extremely low temperature because the majority
of phonons are “frozen out”. Under single-relaxation-time
approximation, Θ can be expressed as Θ = 3v–1l–1, where v is the phonon group velocity and l is
the phonon MFP. Therefore, Θ should drop to a value above zero
at 0 K if phonon is the only heat carrier, and the value is correlated
with defect-induced phonon MFP (l0). Here,
the single-relaxation-time approximation is only intended for basic
physics explanation. The model in this work considers all of the phonon
dispersion and various phonon branches in PE crystals22,28,29,35 (see Supporting Information for more
detailed description).

On the basis of the effective Θ0 shown in Figure 6, which contains
contribution from amorphous phase, l0 values
for unstretched UHMW-PE fibers are determined to be 7.35, 5.47, and
6.19 nm for samples A, B, and C, respectively. Through heat stretching,
their l0 increases up to 24.82, 14.95,
and 13.63 nm. The l0 calculated above
is based on an assumption that the amorphous phase can be considered
as defects in crystals or defective crystals. The other way is ruling
out the contribution of amorphous phase to Θ. On the basis of
a defined crystallinity and an assumption that the fiber sample is
a homogenous composite of amorphous PE and crystal PE, the l0 in crystalline phase can be evaluated. In
the XRD characterization, the crystallinity of sample A is found to
decrease from 92.09 to 82.54% through stretching. By applying effective
medium approximation, the phonon MFP in sample A increases from 9.81
to 46.71 nm after stretching. The significantly elongated phonon MFP
proposes a structural change inside the polymer, which favors phonon
transport. This will be explained by the following structure characterization.

Figure 6 Θ
vs temperature for samples A–C. Θ0 is fitted
from fourth-order polynomial regression. Each data point
is a mean value of 20 repeated measurements. The error bar represents
three standard deviations of the mean.

Raman spectroscopy (confocal Raman system; Voyage, B&W
Tek,
Inc.) is used to characterize the structural change along a stretched
sample. The sample is a duplicate of sample A. Laser beam (wavelength,
532 nm; laser power, 16 mW) scans from the center of heated region
to the unheated region. The polarization of laser is perpendicular
to the fiber axis. A series of Raman spectra are produced as shown
in Figure 7a. The antisymmetric
(1060 cm–1) and symmetric (1130 cm–1) C–C stretching bands represent vibration of skeletal chains
parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis, respectively. The ratio
of band area between the two bands does not change at different positions,
which suggests consistent molecular alignment along a stretched fiber.
The peak at 1296 cm–1 stands for CH2 twisting
mode. The sharp peak at 1416 cm–1 suggests the dominance
of orthorhombic crystalline structure. The splitting peaks at 1440
and 1460 cm–1 stand for CH2 bending vibration
in interfacial (between amorphous phase and crystallites) amorphous
chains and melt-like amorphous chains, respectively. Therefore, we
can use the peak area ratio A1296/(A1440 + A1460) to
evaluate crystallinity and A1440/A1460 to evaluate the composition of the amorphous
phase. Figure 7b shows
insignificant variation of both peak area ratios. In Figure 7c, no obvious change in the
full width at half-maximum (FWHM) is observed for the peaks at 1296,
1440, and 1460 cm–1. This measurement is limited
by the curved surface of fiber because the peak width and intensity
could fluctuate when the laser spot on the surface slightly moves.

region and 10 s for the rest. (b) FWHM of peaks at 1296, 1440, and

2.4 Crystallinity and Crystallite Size: Effect
of Heat Stretching
2.4.1 Crystallite Alignment
For XRD characterization,
50 duplicates of sample A are aligned as a bundle and spread evenly
in the form of a 30 mm × 1.5 mm thin film. Figure 8a,b shows the XRD pole-figure (Rigaku SmartLab
diffractometer) patterns for the (002) plane of the stretched and
reference fiber bundles. The two strong peaks at α = 0°
and β = 0/180° suggest that both samples are found highly
oriented in the axial direction. Figure 8c is a schematic for the setup of XRD pole-figure
measurement. For a more quantitative view, the diffraction intensity
is integrated along α and the integrated intensity is plotted
against the β angle in Figure 8d. We hardly find the difference of peak width between
the stretched sample and its reference group. The FWHM values of intensity
peaks are 10.4° at β = 0 and 8.02° at β = 180°
for the reference sample, and 10.5° at β = 0 and 7.1°
at β = 180° for stretched sample. The narrow width of pole-figure
intensity peaks at β = 0 and 180° indicates that the sample
fiber is highly oriented along the fiber axis no matter it is processed
by heat stretching or not. Thus, all of these data entail negligible
chain orientation change before and after stretching.

UHMW-PE fibers. (a) XRD pole figure for (002) plane of the stretched
sample. (b) XRD pole figure for (002) of the reference sample. (c)
Schematic of pole-figure XRD. (d) Intensity variation with varying
β. The intensity for each β is an integrated value for
α from 0 to 90°.

2.4.2 Crystallite Size
The XRD patterns
(Bruker D8 Discover) for the fiber bundles are also given as shown
in Figure 9. On the
basis of the FHWM of the spectrum, the crystallite sizes for the stretched
sample are determined to be 17.5 nm for (200) planes and 18.28 nm
for the (002) plane. For the reference sample, the crystallite sizes
are 17.4 and 18.34 nm for (200) and (002) planes, respectively. The
negligible variation of crystallite size is contradicted to the defect-induced
phonon MFP, which gets elongated to a great extent after heat stretching.
It is potentially due to reduced scatterings at grain boundaries or
enhanced phonon transport in amorphous regions sandwiched between
crystallites. The reduced boundary scattering could result from decreased
boundary roughness after heat stretching. It is because decreased
roughness allows more specular phonon scatterings to replace diffuse
scatterings at boundaries.36 In the past,
it has been proved that after heat stretching, the amorphous region
will become more aligned along the drawing direction. Such alignment
improvement will definitely enhance the phonon transmission from the
crystalline region to the amorphous region, leading to an increased

2.4.3 Crystallinity
Reduction and Structure Physical
Model
In addition, a new peak at the band of (010) plane
is observed after heat stretching, which suggests that the monoclinic/triclinic
crystals emerge and come to coexist with the dominant orthorhombic
form. It is possible that the sample is cooled under tension. During
cooling in air, the sample remains being suspended before reaching
RT. The fiber could shrink during cooling, which therefore introduces
stress. Orthorhombic PE crystals are found partially conformed to
monoclinic/triclinic structures under stress.37,38 The crystallinity, calculated by comparing the integrated area of
crystalline peaks and amorphous peaks, decreases from 92.09 to 82.54%
after stretching. The new peak has been considered in the fitting
of peaks. The crystallinity of the original fiber agrees well with
our previous measurement (91.9%).22 However,
the decreased crystallinity after stretching is definitely unexpected
because it seems contrary to the k increase. We speculate
that the observed significant increase in k is more
induced by structure reconstructuring favorable for heat conduction.

On the basis of structural characterization results, the structure
reconstructuring could happen in two ways. The first possible case
is the relocation of amorphous structures. The nanocomposite model
of UHMW-PE microfiber is used to explain the effect of amorphous relocation.
In the nanocomposite model, the UHMW-PE microfiber has a composite
structure formed by aligned crystallites embedded in amorphous matrix,
as shown in Figure 10a.39 ϕc, ϕa,⊥, and ϕa,∥ are volumetric
fractions of crystallites (white region), serially connected amorphous
phase (blue region), and parallel connected amorphous phase (green
region), respectively. Here, we assume that (1) the amorphous phase
is homogeneous: ka,⊥ = ka,∥ = ka and
(2) ka and kc remain unchanged during heat stretching. Then, the effective thermal
conductivity (keff) in the fiber axis
can be calculated on the basis of the thermal resistance network model,
as shown in Figure 10b: keff = (1 – ϕa,∥)2kcka/(ϕcka + ϕa,⊥kc) + ϕa,∥ka. The XRD analysis gives ϕc ≈ 92% before stretching and ϕc ≈
83% after stretching. To prove the existence of parallel connected
amorphous phase, we propose that there is no amorphous structure connected
in parallel with the crystalline structure. In other words, ϕa,∥ = 0 for the original PE fiber. Then, even if kc and ka are taken
as the highest experimental values to our knowledge: kc = 100 W/(m·K)17 and ka = 0.3 W/(m·K),40 for original fibers, the calculated value keff ≈ 3.6 W/(m·K) is still fairly lower than the
measured value, 21.3 W/(m·K). This contradiction denies the assumption
that ϕa,∥ = 0, suggesting the existence of
parallel connected amorphous region. Then, we can calculate ϕa,∥ on the basis of the measured k value
of sample A. Before stretching, ϕc ≈ 92% and keff = 21.3 W/(m·K). The ϕa,∥ value is determined to be ∼7.06% and ϕa,⊥ ≈ 0.94%. As for the stretched fibers given ϕc ≈ 83% and k = 50.8 W/(m·K), ϕa,∥ ≈ 16.84% and ϕa,⊥ ≈ 0.16%. It is conclusive that k of the
sampled UHMW-PE fibers is highly sensitive to the fraction of serially
connected amorphous structure because nearly 140% k improvement is obtained when the serially connected amorphous fraction
decreases by merely 0.78%. Sensitivity is presented in Figure 10c. As shown in the figure,
if the serially connected amorphous fraction does not change, the
crystallinity reduction by the stretching will give a slight decrease
of k. However, a small decrease in ϕa,⊥ will increase k significantly.

Figure 10 Proposed physics model:
(a) Structural model of UHMW-PE fiber before
and after heat stretching, with fiber axis in the horizontal direction.
The volumetric fractions are denoted by ϕa,⊥, ϕa,∥, and ϕc for serial
amorphous regions, parallel amorphous regions, and crystalline regions,
respectively. (b) Thermal resistance network model for thermal transport
along fiber axis. Ra,⊥, Ra,∥, and Rc are the thermal resistances of serial amorphous region, parallel
amorphous region, and crystalline region, respectively. For a sample
of unit length and unit cross-sectional area, Ra,⊥ = ϕa,⊥/[ka(ϕa,⊥ + ϕc)2], Ra,∥ = 1/kaϕa,∥, Rc = ϕc/[ka(ϕa,⊥ + ϕc)2], and 1/Reff = 1/Ra,∥ + 1/(Ra,⊥ + Rc). (c) Thermal conductivity variation against the fraction
of serially connected amorphous region. The data points for reference
and stretched samples are determined by the k measured
by the TET technique and the crystallinities given by XRD analysis.

This first case could be supported
by a bending test. A stretched
fiber and an original fiber are bent by hand repeatedly. The stretched
fiber used in the test is stretched under the same condition as sample
A. The performance of the bending test is recorded as a video in Supporting Information. The test shows that a
rugged surface appears on the stretched fiber after repeated bending,
whereas the original fiber still has a smooth and aligned surface
as before bending (Figure 11). The rugged surface suggests the occurrence of plastic deformation
in the bent region. The UHMW-PE fiber could lose some elasticity during
heat stretching, potentially resulted from the reduced fraction of
serially connected amorphous structure. For instance, if there is
no serially connected amorphous structure, the crystalline part could
be more easily bent to have plastic change or to break.

sample that is stretched under the same condition as sample A and
bent for several times. The bent part locates in the middle of the
gap. (b) The surface of the bent part of the sample in (a). The surface
turns from a smooth and aligned shape to a rugged shape, indicating
the occurrence of irreversible deformation during bending. (c) An
original sample after being bent repeatedly. (d) The bent part of
the original sample. It is hard to find from the SEM image where it
is bent. The bending test indicates that the UHMW-PE loses some elasticity
during heat stretching, potentially resulted from the reduced fraction
of serially connected amorphous structure.

The second possible case is the improved alignment of amorphous
phase. It has been documented that the amorphous structure could be
partially aligned to the stretching direction during mechanical stretching.41,42 If the k of amorphous structures is enhanced due
to the alignment of amorphous chains, then the overall k will be able to increase even when crystalline fraction decreases.
To study the orientation of amorphous structures in samples, polarized
Raman spectroscopy is employed here by adding a polarizer to the confocal
Raman system. A laser beam is focused on the neck region of a sample
stretched under the same condition as sample A. As introduced in the
literature,43 the intensity of crystalline
bands at 1296 and 1416 cm–1 becomes higher as laser
polarization is gradually aligned to the c-axis of
PE crystallites from a perpendicular position (γ = 90°).
It is reasonable to assume that c-axis of PE crystallite
is parallel to the fiber axis (or stretching direction) here based
on the XRD analysis. A reverse trend is found for the amorphous bands
at 1440 and 1460 cm–1. These phenomena also occur
in our sample, as shown in Figure 12a. Only the spectra of the stretched fiber are presented
here because those of the reference sample share the same trend as
polarization varies. Therefore, the change of the relative intensity
of polarized Raman spectra could be used to indicate the degree of
orientation. Figure 12b,c shows the variation of relative intensities with varying angle
between polarization and fiber axis (γ) for reference and stretched
samples, respectively. As seen, by comparing the percentage intensity
variation along γ, obviously enhanced anisotropy in amorphous
region and slightly reduced anisotropy for crystallites can be found.
For example, the relative intensity of 1296 cm–1 band drops by ∼60% before stretching and by ∼50% after
stretching when γ is changed from 0 to 90°, indicating
a reduced structural anisotropy for crystal PE. However, this slight
alignment reduction cannot be revealed in our pole-figure analysis
using XRD. Then, we compare the intensities of the four peaks at a
certain γ. As γ = 0°, the relative intensities of
amorphous peaks remain unchanged before and after stretching although
the amorphous fraction increases after stretching, according to XRD
analysis. This proposes a reduced fraction of unaligned amorphous
structures in the amorphous region because the crystalline fraction
decreases after stretching. As γ = 90°, stronger bands
for parallel amorphous structure and perpendicular crystallites alignment
are found. It indicates that unaligned crystallites and aligned amorphous
structure increase in quantity after stretching. As we indicated above,
the reduction in the alignment in the crystalline structure is rather
trivial. However, the alignment improvement in the amorphous structure
is more obvious. After stretching, the anisotropic ratio of CH2 bending vibration near 1440 and 1460 cm–1 have an intensity increase of 536 and 348%, respectively, when γ
changes from 0 to 90°. Before stretching, this increase is only
372 and 257%, respectively. The amplified anisotropic nature of bending
vibration in amorphous chains suggests that amorphous chains are more
aligned to the fiber axis, which can lead to a substantial enhancement
in k. In conclusion, the polarized Raman study shows
that the amorphous chains turn to be more aligned although some crystallites
become less aligned. The high k (∼350) of
a single PE molecular chain suggests a great potential for k enhancement by aligning carbon chains. It allows more
heat load be transferred by the backbones of PE in the same direction.
This will significantly reduce the huge thermal resistance of the
amorphous structure among crystallites in the axis direction, leading
to a great k enhancement in overall.

for an UHMW-PE microfiber before and
after stretching: (a) Raman spectra of stretched fiber sample with
varied γ, where γ is the angle between fiber axis and
laser polarization. (b, c) Normalized peak intensity vs γ for
the sample before and after stretching, respectively. The peak intensities
have been normalized by the intensity at 1296 cm–1 when the polarization is parallel to fiber axis (γ = 0°).

Besides the two assumptions based
on experimental evidence, there
is a third case, which is possible but not covered by the experimental
study in this work. It must be remembered that the stretching process
ends with quenching in ambient air. The cooling process could end
in 1–2 s in the case of sample A. During cooling, a temperature
gradient should exist along the fiber, with the highest temperature
in the center. The temperature gradient can guide the orientation
of growing crystalline lamellae. However, the recrystallization could
be stopped on its half way, which makes the crystal melts stay amorphous
in terms of XRD analysis. The partial melting of crystalline phase
allows the chain movement, which functions together with the temperature
gradient to make an overall improved alignment. The increased amorphous
fraction should come from the molten crystals, which might sustain
better heat conduction but not be detectable by XRD.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have made breakthrough advance
in increasing the k of crystalline UHMW-PE microfibers
from 19–22 W/(m·K)
(unstretched) to a value of 50.8 W/(m·K), representing the highest
repeatable and engineering level k increase for PE
microfibers. The highest k is obtained when the UHMW-PE
fiber is stretched at a temperature (131.5 °C) near the melting
point with a low strain rate (0.0129 s–1) and a
low final strain ratio (∼6.6). Furthermore, we discovered that
the amorphous structure fraction increases after stretching, but such
more amorphous-composed material rather sustains a much higher k than the highly aligned original sample of higher crystal
fraction. A general trend of higher k with higher
stretching temperature is observed. k drops when
the stretching temperature increases very close to the melting point
(∼135 °C), likely due to the absence of stress when crystallites
melt. Calculations based on thermal reffusivity at the 0 K limit showed
that the defect-induced phonon MFP increases significantly after heat
stretching. XRD pole-figure analysis provided evidence that the orientation
of crystallites barely changes after stretching, which points physics
reasons to the amorphous region for significant k increase. Polarized Raman spectroscopy indicates that the amorphous
structure became more aligned after stretching. Aligned amorphous
chains lead to enhanced thermal conductivity in the amorphous region,
which can significantly increase the overall thermal conductivity.
Our bending test of the stretched samples shows more plasticity, suggesting
a reduced fraction of amorphous structure among crystallites previously
existing in the fiber axial direction. Even this small amount of reduction
in the serially connected amorphous structure will increase the overall
thermal conductivity significantly.
