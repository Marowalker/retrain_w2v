Several new spinning
methods have been developed recently to mass
produce polymeric fibers. Pressure-coupled infusion gyration is one
of them. Because the fiber diameter plays a pivotal role for the mechanical,
electrical, and optical properties of the produced fiber mats, in
this work, polyethylene oxide is used as a model polymer, and the
processing parameters including polymer concentration, infusion (flow)
rate, working pressure, and rotational speed are chosen as variables
to control fiber diameters spanning the micro- to nanoscale. The experimental
process is modeled using response surface methodology, both in linear
and nonlinear fitting formats, to allow optimization of processing
parameters. The successes of the fitted models are evaluated using
adjusted R2 and Akaike information criterion.
A systematic description of the experimental process could be obtained
according to the model in this study. From the analysis of variance,
it is concluded that the polymer concentration of the solution and
the working pressure affected the fiber diameters more strongly than
other parameters.

1 Introduction
Polymeric
fibers have a vast scope of applications and have recently
garnered much attention owing to their various outstanding features
such as high porosity, superior mechanical properties, and large surface
area to volume ratio, which render them valuable in diverse applications
such as cellular migration scaffolds,1−6 protective clothing,7−12 composite reinforcements,13,14 and nanosensors.15,16 Additionally, a well-aligned fibrous structure has potential for
applications that require a particular orientation over nonwoven fibers
(randomly interlaced), for example, the differentiation basement of
tendon cells and peripheral nerves.17−20 Despite the versatility of nanofibers,
their use is still restricted by the lack of proper quantity-production
methods.

State of the art techniques used to fabricate fine
fibers include
phase separation, template synthesis, and electrospinning, with the
latter being the most versatile and promising in the past decades;
but the utilization of electrospinning is restricted by its many disadvantages
such as random orientation of produced fibers, difficulty to build
three-dimensional (3D) structures, sensitivity to solution electrical
conductivity and jet stability, high cost and low safety due to applied
high voltage (kV level), and low production rate. Although its sister
processes, for example, self-organized needleless (tube electrospinning)21,22 or the use of multiple needles,23 can
improve the electrospinning productivity, they introduce side effects
such as capillary effect (multiple needles) and increase the production
cost by requiring a bigger size of equipment.

To overcome the
major limitations of electrospinning, several methods
have been explored that largely originate from the industrial jet-spinning
technique. They make use of inexpensive centrifugation for low cost
and large scale production of uniaxially aligned 3D fibrous bundles
consistently, and they generate fibers with diameters ranging from
micro- to nanoscale. These methods include centrifugal spinning,24−26 force spinning,27 pressurized gyration,28−32 infusion gyration,33 and pressure-coupled
infusion gyration (PCIG).34 Many previous
studies demonstrated that these techniques are capable of effectively
producing a variety of products independent of the material properties.
Experimental investigation into PCIG demonstrated that it can overcome
discontinuous production of pressurized gyration and force spinning
and is able to produce finer fibers than infusion gyration and centrifugal
spinning, which are only really capable of generating fibers on submicron
or micrometer level.34

PCIG is able
to bring materials to the nanoscale not only to improve
their properties and afford them new advanced features beyond bulk
materials but also to produce uniaxially aligned 3D fibrous bundles
consistently and cost-effectively. During rotational spinning, PCIG
feeds the polymer solutions into the vessel continuously and utilizes
gas blowing and high-speed rotation to extrude several parallel polymer
jets from orifices that are equally spaced on the surface of the vessel.
Fibers with a controlled morphology can be prepared by selectively
adjusting the processing parameters, for example, solution concentration,
applied pressure, rotational speed, infusion (flow) rate and also,
if necessary, collection distance. Compared with other gyration methods,
the fiber produced using the PCIG method is much thinner. This is
because the mass transfer of dynamic fluid flow can be regulated by
the infusion rate of the solution when flowing across the orifice
during spinning, and hence the input material can be effectively used
to obtain the desired product morphology by balancing different combinations
of processing parameters with solvent evaporation.

For some
specific applications that are sensitive to the porosity
and surface area (dominated by fiber diameter), for instance, cellular
scaffolds, the fiber should be produced at a given diameter. However,
PCIG is affected by various interacting parameters simultaneously;
thus, to design an appropriate experimental process is complex for
achieving a desired diameter, and the use of numerous trials to prepare
fibers with the desired diameters would be expensive and time-consuming.
Researchers have tried to figure out scientific and forecasting tools
in a variety of processes. Nowadays, there are several data mining
and machine learning algorithms that can capably and reliably optimize
the experimental process by quantifying the relationships between
data using effective techniques such as Box–Behnken design,
response surface methodology (RSM), and artificial neural networks
(ANN), with the last one more popular now.

ANN and RSM are two
widely used methods of mathematical modeling
and computer simulation for computational processes.35,36 ANN consists of input, hidden, and output layers and is inspired
by the working principles/structures of biological neural networks
of the human brain. There are different populations of interconnected
processing units (neurons) within layers, and these units are interconnected
with each other to investigate their inter-relationships and predict
the specific outputs that relate to different input data and specific
functions used. ANN, more precisely, the three layers back propagation
(BP) ANN has been used as a tool for modeling the electrospinning
processes as well as for predicting the geometry and mechanical properties
of the spun fibers. The units in the hidden layer can be manipulated
as required; hence, any continuous functions can be represented with
any precision. In addition, BP ANN is able to solve multivariate regression
problems (linear/nonlinear) by training models through computing functions’
gradient, then adjusting the weights and thresholds between neurons
in each layer along the negative gradient direction, and to optimize
the functions (also known as the gradient descent algorithm).37,38

However, despite the aforementioned strengths of ANN, there
are
also several known limitations of ANN, including: the slow convergence
when the estimated value is close to the target; sensitivity to the
noise of the training sample, that is, relatively poor training effect
if there are intense changes in the sample; more notably, a tricky
issue is that there is currently no general formula for the determination
of the number of units (neurons) in the hidden layer, when the network
structure is designed. As the number of the units directly determines
the ability of the network to dig linear/nonlinear information from
data, insufficient quantity of selected units may lead information
to be expressed inadequately; an excessive quantity of units will
increase the computational overhead exponentially, also resulting
in a decline in network generalization.35−38

RSM is a convenient method
that needs fewer experiments than ANN
to construct an effective model. It shows good performance if the
data are well-distributed statistically in the design of the experiment.39 On the basis of the training data, RSM uses
statistical methods, taking into account the combined effects of several
parameters to estimate the relationships (e.g., functional relevance)
and the response of the modeling process by fitting an empirical model
(linear/nonlinear). The resulting models can be evaluated and further
used as a tool for predicting and optimizing the settings of the independent
variables to reduce residuals.39,40 According to its structural
characteristics, in respect of obtaining results of the interaction
between different components for the whole system, sensitivity analysis,
and other in-depth and advanced information, RSM has shown better
performance in comparison with ANN. In some previous studies, RSM
has been used for optimizing processes and material properties in
different fields, for instance poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel,41 thermoplastic elastomers,42 and diamond-like carbon films.43

To have an overview of the effect of the PCIG experimental
parameters
individually and the quantitative basis of the relationships between
PCIG parameters and the spun fiber diameter, RSM is used in this work.
Using a mathematical model to describe the effects of PCIG parameters
allows us to represent the influencing parameters in a simple and
systematic way and to predict the response of the experiments with
different parameter combinations. In addition, owing to the benefit
of RSM, the number of experiments for testing the influences of all
possible combinations of parameters on diameter could be reduced.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials and Experiment
Preparation
Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, molecular weight (Mw) of 2 × 105 g mol–1) purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK) is used as-received, and deionized
water is selected as the solvent. The PCIG apparatus used in this
work (Figure 1a) consists
of a cylindrical rotatable vessel 40 mm in height and 60 mm in diameter.
It is equipped with 20 orifices symmetrically distributed on the vessel
surface, each 0.5 mm in diameter. A dc motor joint is at the top of
the vessel, and it can work in the range of 4.5–15 V to drive
vessel rotation at various speeds up to 36 000 rpm. The injected
polymer solution flow is controlled by a syringe pump (PHD Ultra 4400,
Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, UK) with a 10 mL syringe and connected
at the bottom of the vessel by a plastic tube. A nitrogen gas cylinder
is connected to the vessel bottom using a T-junction to provide pressure
(up to 0.3 MPa). The collector, a stationary copper mesh, is placed
around the vessel at a preset distance of 100 mm to collect the jetted
fibers. The distance between the orifices in the gyrator is 9 mm,
and the vertical copper wires in the collector are 25 mm apart. The
spun fibers are assessed by means of a JSM-6301F scanning electron
microscope, and the fiber diameters are determined by Image J software
from random fibers at different locations per sample. A typical scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) image of a spun fiber using PCIG is shown
in Figure 1b.

formation. (b) Typical SEM image of spun nanofiber
using PCIG.

2.2 Design
of Experiments
To obtain a
more systematic understanding of the processing conditions and to
establish a quantitative basis for the relationships between PCIG
parameters and the fiber diameter, RSM is employed. During this study,
fiber diameters are prepared by varying four parameters: PEO solution
concentration, pressure, infusion (flow) rate, and rotation speed,
and their relation to the fiber diameter is investigated using RSM.
All other parameters including humidity (38.5%) and ambient temperature
(25 °C) are fixed during the experiments.

On the basis
of the previous work,34 it is found that
the appropriate distance of collection (from orifices to collector)
is determined by the duration of solvent evaporation and the diameter
of the spiral trajectory required for the polymer jets. An insufficient
collection distance will result in the formation of thicker or coarser
fibers, which are without enough elongation before reaching the collector.
On the other hand, if the selected collection distance is beyond the
critical value needed for evaporation of the solvent, the effect of
further increase in the distance can be negligible. In this work,
the orifice–collector distance is fixed at 100 mm.

The
infusion rate affects the hydrostatic pressure existing at
the jetting orifices, and the volume and mass of polymer solution
passing the orifice are also controlled by the infusion rate. A higher
infusion rate will give a shorter solvent evaporation/polymer jet
stretching time, hence promoting thicker and multiple polymer jets
formed during spinning, which were observed in our previous work.34 Six levels of flow rate were chosen (500, 1000,
2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 μL/min) in this work.

The polymer
concentration is one of the key factors in the spinning
process; it selectively affects the formation and morphology of the
spun fiber via adjusting solution’s fluid properties, for example,
the viscosity and chain entanglement degree, which is a prerequisite
for uniform fiber formation. A higher polymer concentration helps
to stabilize the polymer jets in the fiber generation process, which
is crucial for the formation of a thicker fiber. In this work 5, 10,
15, and 21 wt % are used as the four levels of solution concentration.

The influence of applied pressure is studied by performing experiments
at three levels of pressure (0.1–0.3 MPa). A high pressure
would lead to a reduction in the fiber diameter at any fixed polymer
concentration; this is attributed to the enhanced thinning effect
introduced by gas blowing, and hence solvent evaporation that takes
place in the radial direction of jets would also be facilitated by
a higher applied pressure. In addition, the enhanced gas blowing would
help to improve the instability of polymer jets at the orifices, which
would promote the formation of the beaded or “defective”
fiber.

The combination of solution blowing and centrifugal force
act against
the solution’s surface tension and thus result in the deformation
of the polymer droplets, thereby enabling the formation of fibers
from the vessel orifice. The higher rotational speed will enhance
this deformation by increasing the centrifugal force. The presence
of non-Newtonian fluid shear stress acts against the normal stress
and leads to tension and deformation along the same direction as the
planar effect.28 Thus, the stretching in
polymer jets will be further accelerated by the centrifugal force
and gas blowing. The rotational speeds selected for this study are
10 000, 24 000, and 36 000 rpm.

2.3 RSM Implementation
To capture the
effects of all control parameters, 120 experiments were carried out
for different combinations of parameters set at different levels.
To achieve a high fitting degree, the input data should be measured
accurately and should be sensitive to the parameters of the experimental
process. For each individual experiment, over 100 fiber diameters
were obtained from the random fibers of each sample, and each average
diameter value was used as 1 input data to fit the model. However,
there are 19 combinations, which give us droplets or beaded fibers,
so the data of the remaining 101 experiments were used.

After
measuring the fiber diameter related to each experimental data point,
for describing the behavior of the response, it is necessary to fit
a mathematical function based on the level of the study. For achieving
a significant regression, the major part of variation of the experiment
data must be well-fitted (explained) by the regression equation, and
the remainder will certainly be induced by fitting residuals. Most
of the variation of the residuals is caused by error, in this case,
it is related to the spread of fiber diameters and random fluctuation
during the fiber diameter measurement. We expect the spread of diameters
to be the dominant effect. We used Mathematica to process the results
of the experiments using the least-squares algorithm, which is a multiple
regression analysis that is used to fit a mathematical model to a
set of experimental data with the lowest residual. For that reason,
both linear and nonlinear models were applied, as we assume linear
or nonlinear mapping might exist between the parameters and fiber
diameters. The goodness of the models that fit experimental data were
compared using adjusted R2 and the Akaike
information criterion (AIC) test. The adjusted R2 represents the level of the total variability that can be
expected from the resulting model, adjusted by R2 as more fitting variables were used. The AIC, a model selection
criterion established on the basis of information entropy, can penalize
the too complicated model (with redundant variables) by increasing
its AIC value. A lower AIC value is preferred, as then smaller residuals
exist between the fitting curve and the experimental data. Additionally,
application of analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the
quality of the fits, as the mathematical model found after fitting
the function to the data sometimes does not satisfactorily describe
the experimental domain under study of the linear models. The central
idea of ANOVA was to compare the variations caused by changes of the
levels of parameters with the variations by the random errors inherent
in the measurements of the generated responses. Hence, it allows us
to assess the source of the experimental variance and the significance
of the regression used to predict the responses.

3 Results and Discussion
We aim to find an optimal model to
describe the relationship between
the fiber diameter and processing parameters of PCIG [polymer concentration
(c), infusion (flow) rate (f), pressure (p), and rotational speed
(g)]; RSM is employed in this study. Introducing physical frameworks
in the model building may help us have an in-depth understanding of
the experimental process and the mechanism of fiber formation process
and improve the goodness of the fitted models. Mellado et al.25 studied a basic theoretical rotary spinning
framework to characterize the regimes of poly (lactic acid) nanofiber
production. Their model can be expressed as 1  where r is the radius of
the spun fiber; v is the kinematic viscosity (calculated
by extensional viscosity/density of solution); Rc is the collection distance that span a range from 90 to 180
mm; Ω is the rotational speed (varies from 4000 to 37 000
rpm); U is the mass velocity; and a is the initial jet radius.

PCIG parameters affect the mean
fiber diameter to different extents.
The effects of each processing parameter on the fiber diameter are
correlated and are presented in Figure 1S of the Supporting information, which indicates that the polymer concentration
(viscosity) and the mass velocity are positively correlated with the
fiber diameter. Equation 1 also offers us some guidance, and the minimum rotational speed (Ωc) for fiber formation is represented in eq 2 2  

It indicates that the rotational speed can be considered to have
a power law relationship with other parameters, where μ is the
extensional viscosity, ρ is the density of the solution, and
σ is the surface tension. However, Mellado et al.25 did not incorporate additional pressure and
flow rate parameters in their experiments. So, some mathematical expressions
are suggested, which take into account the trends of variation of
the fiber diameter displayed in Figure 1S, including a quartic relationship between the infusion (flow) rate
and diameter, linear dependences are suggested with respect to concentration
and pressure, and include a power. The fitting model is given in eq 3, which offers an AIC value
of 1142.35 and adjusted R2 of 95.1%, and
the coefficients are shown in Table 1S.
The distribution of fitted residuals and a typical example of a residual
plot (Figure 2; details
of distribution and all other plots are shown in Table 2S and Figure 2S) indicate
that the residuals of the data point related with the current model
vary dramatically. Hence, this is inadequate to make precise inferences
about the data behavior in the experimental range of this work. It
is noteworthy that the component of pressure in eq 3 has an extremely large power but is multiplied
by a very small constant (i.e., β7 ≪ β8, as seen in Table 1S). It can
be rewritten in this limit in the form of the exponential function
for the future fittings, that is, eβp. 3

plot (b) of the
power law model derived from Mellado et al.’s work25 (changing the infusion rate and polymer concentration,
with a fixed pressure of 0.2 MPa and a rotational speed of 36 000
rpm).

Because PCIG is more complicated
than the given framework of basic
rotary spinning and the interactive effects between different parameters
are not clearly known, for example, how the pressure affects solution
flow or how the concentration affects viscosity through evaporation,
it is essential to develop an empirical model based on the experimental
data to allow establishment of a quantitative relationship between
the fiber diameter and combined parameters.

3.1 Linear
Model Fitting
The general
equations for response y (diameter) are developed
by exploring fitting to multivariate experimental data using all possible
polynomial functions of the variables up to a given order, which also
can readily be extended to higher orders. Initially, we confine ourselves
to linear combinations with variables up to second order forms, which
offer a certain level of complexity to a model but without considering
the trend of the experimental results, and its results can be used
as another baseline (apart from the results of Mellado et al.’s25 work as presented in eq 3) to compare with each result of the following
updates. The confidence interval we use for all fitting tests in this
work is set to 95% by default. In the first fitting test, we look
at functions that include all possible combinations of terms up to
quadratic form in the processing parameters, which involves checking
16 384 nonrepeating combinations out of 1 048 576.
Additionally, effects of pressure and rotational speed act within
an inverse relationship to the fiber diameter (as seen in Figure 1Sc,d), that is, increasing the pressure
and speed will decrease the fiber diameter. So, it suggests that polynomials
in the inverse of p and g (1/p and 1/g instead of p and g in the model fitting) might be better, which
is also consistent with Mellado et al.’s25 work, as presented in eq 1. The best-fitted quadratic model equation for the
mean fiber diameter is given by eq 4. 4  Here, y is the mean fiber
diameter (y), and the value of each estimated coefficient
(β) can be found in Table 1. It is worth noting that an overcomplicated expression
may perform less well than the optimal expression; this is because
the AIC and adjusted R2 penalized the
use of too many free parameters that actually do not contribute to
improve (explain) the original variance. Figure 3a shows the distribution of the fitted residuals
of the data points, and Figure 3b is a typical plot that indicates how well eq 4 fits each data point. Its variance
(ANOVA) table is shown in Table 1. SS is the sum of the squared observation deviations,
and it can be dismembered in the sum of squares due to model residual
and the sum of the square of regression. P-values
represent the level of impact significances of the coefficients on
the fiber diameter. As we use a 95% confidence interval, if the P-value is larger than 0.05, the related parameter has little
impact on the mean fiber diameter based on the related fitting model,
and it also reveals the quality of the current model. Table 1 indicates that the regressed
coefficients of c2, c/g, f/p are quite
random, and the obtained adjusted AIC and R2 are 1118.93 and 86.2%, which show that the quality of the fit is
not very good, as to find the major explanatory variables, the adjusted R2 should be ≥95%.

To improve the model, visual inspection of the details of the experimental
data and residual plots can help to generate valuable guides to the
model suitability by denoting a response that indicates the kind of
terms that need to be added to the model for improvement. Figure 1Sb suggests that there is a two-peaked
dependence on the parameter of flow rate (f); so
going to the fourth power of f will help to improve
our model. 5  

Equation 5 shows the
linear model with the best AIC out of 524 287 nonrepeating
combinations of processing parameters that are needed to test, after
the power of infusion rate is pushed up to fourth, which gives the
AIC of 1107.22 and adjusted R2 of 88.1%.
The ANOVA table, as shown in Table 2, clearly indicates that the given estimated coefficient
of the related model is more precise than the previous linear models,
and the estimated coefficients are more significant than the previous
two at a 95% confidence interval for the spun fibers. Also, the terms
of concentration, pressure–1, flow rate, and interactive
terms between concentration and pressure–1 have
shown a significant influence on the mean diameter of spun fibers.
The addition of the fourth power terms in f has certainly
helped to improve the fitting performance. Figure 4 indicates that the data are better fitted
and the residuals are effectively reduced.

The goodness of fitting of the linear test we applied does not
give a high adjusted R2 (up to 88.1%),
and we know that more parameters used in the function would help to
improve the fitting precision. However, the number of fitting parameters
in eq 5 has already reached
14 (but the observed fiber measurements give just 101 data). Continuously
increasing the complexity of the fitting function may lead to overfitting
because its excess estimated parameters would make the equation less
generalized. Hence, it suggests that nonlinear methods could be used
to update the model, as more complicated functions can be achieved
using fewer parameters, and we are edging above the rule of thumb
of no more than 1 fitting parameter per 10 measurements. Additionally,
the estimate of error variance, also known as the estimation variance,
is a benchmark showing the variance in fitting parameters. It is based
on the sum of square error and takes into account the number of used
parameters in the fitting and can be used to measure the goodness
of fit.

3.2 Nonlinear Model Fitting
In contrast
with the linear quadratic model, which has a general type of function
that consists of simple multiplication and summation between parameters
up to the second order, the forms of nonlinear model are almost infinite,
including the incorporation of exponential functions, trigonometric
functions, and so forth. To perform the trials on all possible combinations
of the nonlinear component is computationally expensive. Hence, we
inspect each graph in Figure 1S based on
our experience and combine all empirical components together to perform
a nonlinear fitting. From Figure 1Sa, a
similar quartic form applies to the dependence on f under all conditions. We pick up the dependence on f from the last best-fitted linear function, as it gives us an obvious
improvement after we change the parameter of f up
to the fourth power, and the others are kept in linear forms. The
fitted nonlinear function with the best AIC is given by eq 6 (the estimated coefficients as
seen in Table 3S). 6  

The resulting adjusted R2 is 94.9%,
and the lowest AIC that could be achieved
is 1145.23. The residual distribution and a typical residual plot
are shown in Figure 5. The obtained estimate of variance is 4470.67. This is much better
in terms of adjusted R2. However, a much
higher AIC is given in this test. This is because the adjusted R2 would be increased only if the new fitting
parameter improves the model over the expected, and we only use eight
coefficients in the current test, which is less than those in any
previous functional models in the linear fitting work; so this AIC
value is perhaps acceptable. It is necessary to find suitable terms
that can accurately describe the training data as well as the optimal
compromises between the possible high adjusted R2 and low AIC value, which need to be achieved.

Figure 5 Residual distribution
(a) and typical residual plot (b) of the
first nonlinear model (changing the infusion rate and polymer concentration,
with a fixed pressure of 0.2 MPa and a rotational speed of 36 000
rpm).

According to the fitted result
of the last linear model presented
in eq 5 (with AIC of
1107.22 and the trends of the data variations, as shown in Figure 1Sa,c,d), it is suggested that there are
more appropriate quadratic terms for the parameters of solution concentration
and rotational speed but linear dependence on pressure. Thus, we increase
the order of c and g up to second.
The optimized equation is given below (eq 7 and the estimated coefficients as listed
in Table 4S) 7  

The AIC is decreased to 1132.72, and the adjusted R2 is 95.5%. The quadratic form of subfunction
dependence
on the solution concentration and rotational speed and the linear
terms of pressure can help to improve our fitting performance (3880.16
of the estimated variance) by offering a lower residual, as shown
in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Residual distribution
(a) and typical residual plot (b) of the
nonlinear model with quadratic concentration and rotational speed
terms but linear pressure terms (changing the infusion rate and polymer
concentration, with a fixed pressure of 0.2 MPa and a rotational speed
of 36 000 rpm).

For improving the model one step further, we need to find
what
part of function space is giving the biggest deviation as well as
the biggest residuals. The Box–Whisker charts in Figure 7 show the influences of fluctuation
in the experimental parameters by using fractional residuals as a
fraction of the mean diameters; they also indicate the median, 25
and 75% quartiles, as well as upper and lower bounds as a function
of the concentration, flow rate, pressure, and rotational speed. It
should be noted that the pressure and rotational speed are in their
inverse forms.

Figure 7 Box–Whisker charts of fractional residuals versus
the experimental
parameters: (a) concentration, (b) flow rate, (c) inverse pressure,
and (d) inverse rotational speed.

Figure 7 indicates
that the deviations of residuals are random, and some are very large.
The lower rotational speed and higher concentration give the relatively
lower deviations. It suggests that there may be systematic relationships,
which exist in the pressure and rotational speed deviations. The random
deviation is probably because the robust process of PCIG is a quantitatively
tuned method for the fabrication of nanofibers but with a compromise
of precise control of parameters that affects the mean fiber diameter.

The mean values of the experimental parameters chosen in the experiments
are listed in Table 3, which indicates that the constant terms of f and g in the model are possibly negligible because of the small
coefficients with a very low multiplying power at the beginning of
the functions. Presenting this change on graphs shows that the curves
are forced to pass the origin. It is also sensible from the physical
point of view of the PCIG process, as it explains as that if the infusion
rate is decreased to be infinitely small, the resulting fibers will
have an infinitely small diameter. Taking into account all optimizations
we raised so far, the most up-to-date model can be presented as 8

Figure 8 (all the
other residual plots of this test are shown in Figure 3S) shows that the residuals have been reduced in the
above model (3800.86 of estimated error variance), and the residual
for each experimental parameter combination is listed in Table 5S. The obtained AIC value is 1128.83,
and the adjusted R2 is 95.7%. The relevant
confidence intervals of the coefficients of pressure, concentration,
and rotational speed are fairly standard, and the interval between
5 and 95% cumulative probabilities are listed in Table 4.

4 Conclusions
In this
paper, RSM is applied to investigate the novel PCIG process
for nanofiber making. ANOVA (variance) is carried out at the significance
level of 5% to study the effects of the input parameters on the average
fiber diameter, including infusion rate (500–5000 μL/min),
rotational speed (10 000–36 000 rpm), applied
pressure (0.1–0.3 MPa), and polymer concentration (5–21
wt %). To use this method in experimental optimization, it is necessary
to select an appropriate experimental design to fit a mathematical
formulation for evaluating the quality and accuracy of the fitting
model based on the obtained experimental data. It is concluded that
the best linear model gives an AIC of 1107.22 with a coefficient of
determination (adjusted R2) of 88.1% and
indicates that the PEO polymer concentration and pressure had more
significant effects than other parameters, for example, rotational
speed on the spun fiber diameter. The best nonlinear model that we
achieved offers an AIC of 1128.83 and a coefficient of determination
of 95.7%. Our model is useful for predicting and optimizing the process
of fabrication of other types of nanofibers, using the PCIG method.
However, it should be noted that the effects of physical properties
of polymer solution, for example, viscosity and surface tension that
have large differences based on different type of polymers, are not
considered in this model. This could be addressed in the subsequent
work.
