Despite
recent efforts in modernization of water treatment facilities,
the problem of access to healthy drinking water for hundreds of millions
of people has still not been solved. A water filter based on Cu-coated
nanofibrillated cellulose with controlled porosity was prepared by
the “paper-making” method. We have optimized the proper
mass and ratio of functionalized and pure nanofibrillated cellulose
for the preparation of the filter. MS2 bacteriophages were used to
model human pathogenic virions. We tested our filter material in batch
experiments and the fixed filters in flow experiments. The fabricated
Cu-coated nanofibrillated cellulose filters were characterized by
scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, specific surface
area measurement (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller), dynamic light
scattering, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Our
measurements proved that the fixation of cellulose nanofibers plays
a significant role in the degree of virus retention and it greatly
enhances the efficiency of the filtration. By using these functionalized
water filters, we were able to achieve a virus retention of at least
5 magnitudes (5Log) at three different pH values: 5.0, 7.5, and 9.

==== Body
1 Introduction
According to World Health
Organization (WHO),1 the drinking water
of at least 1.8 billion people is contaminated
with feces, which leads to about 502 000 gastrointestinal infections,
resulting in death from dehydration each year. For countries struggling
with providing the access to healthy drinking water, the criteria
for adequate water treatment are difficult to fulfill. In such regions,
point-of-use (POU) water treatment can be a possible solution.2,3

Membrane processes have proven to be the vanguard of water
purification
methods, as the conventional techniques that have been used for decades
(i.e., coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, etc.) are not efficient
enough in regard to virus removal.4,5 These membrane
processes can rely on many different techniques on the scale from
micro- to nanofiltration.6−9 Therefore, nanomaterials, i.e., nanofibers10 are thus found in the emerging focus of membrane
research for their unique properties. However, size-exclusion processes
are not completely suitable for the removal of viral contaminations
because of their small size, typically in the range of 20–100
nm. Recent promising attempts on virus retention rely on electrostatically
enhanced adsorption forces2,11 because most waterborne
virions possess a net negative surface charge.12,13

Nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), which is built by the aggregation
of elementary cellulose fibrils, is a nanomaterial with a high length-to-width
aspect ratio and remarkable mechanical properties, such as toughness,
flexibility, and high relative surface area. Cellulose nanofibers
have an average diameter of 20–60 nm, as proposed by Lavoine
et al.14 NFC has the ability to form fibrillar
networks due to its strong affinity to make interfibrillar hydrogen
bonds. By compressing the NFC content of a suspension followed by
the elimination of the continuous medium, a strong cellulose film,
called nanopaper, can be produced.15 The
porosity of such samples is rather low16 due to the capillary action that leads to the compaction of the
fibers.17

There are recent studies
investigating the use of cellulose in
virus filtration. Metreveli et al.18 prepared
a filter of highly crystalline nanocellulose fibers, and from their
experimental data they calculated a log retention value (LRV) probability
of ≥5.3 for virions with a diameter of ≥30 nm, and an
LRV ≥ 6.3 for virions with ≥80 nm diameter. Another
study, by Huang et al.,19 described the
application of cellulose acetate nanofibers (ordered by electrospinning)
for virus filtration experiments, and they concluded a rejection value
of 98.68 ± 0.71% for Hepatitis C virus (d =
55–65 nm). Gustafsson and Mihranyan prepared virus filters
of controlled pore sizes by using heat pressing of highly crystalline,
nonfunctionalized Cladophora cellulose-based wet mass at different
temperatures.20 They used surrogate Fluorosphere
nanoparticles of 23 ± 3 nm in their filtration experiments, which
resulted in an average LRV of 3.8.

Even though these results
are very promising, we believed that
the virus filtration properties of cellulose-based membranes can be
enhanced to an even higher level of performance. Therefore, in this
study, NFC was used as a filter matrix, being a potential low-cost
and biodegradable alternative for the less developed countries in
need of reformed water treatment. The filter material was functionalized
with in situ synthesized Cu nano- and microparticles, as Cu reportedly
shows antiviral properties.21 To understand
the key factors in virus filtration, four different kinds of samples
have been investigated: pure NFC suspension as control, Cu-functionalized
NFC suspension to see the effects of functionalization, Cu-functionalized
NFC filter (three prototypes with three different Cu contents), which
gives information about the impact of defined membrane structure,
and furthermore, to see whether the amount of materials used in the
membrane fabrication plays any role, the same filter but with doubled
amount of NFC and Cu was prepared and investigated. All virus filtration
experiments were performed with MS2 bacteriophages, as their size
(approximately 27 nm) and behavior are comparable with those of human
pathogenic viruses2 and because currently
there is no published research about virus filtration performed on
cellulose-based filters that work with virions smaller than 30 nm.18,19 Our virus filtration experiments rely on membrane processes as well,
and although these filters are not heavy-duty membranes, they still
have the potential of great membrane development (Figure 1).

paper (b, d, e).

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Investigations of the Cu-NFC
Film
The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies are presented
in Figure 2. These
studies revealed
the 111, 200, and 220 reflections of metallic Cu,25 and the reflection with the full width at half-maximum
of 2θ = 22° can be assigned to NFC.26 The results indicate that the surface of NFC was functionalized
with metallic Cu. Even though Fehling’s reaction is known to
result in Cu2O, our studies relied on the phenomenon discussed
in 1915 that applying excess of reductant can result in metallic Cu.27

Figure 2 XRD analysis of copper (black) and Cu-NFC film (red).

Representative scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) micrographs are
shown in Figure 1c–e.
Spherical structures 1–5 μm in diameter (in orange after
applying manual false coloring for better visibility) indicate the
metallic Cu on the surface of the fibers. SEM studies at higher magnifications
(Figure 1e) showed
that many particles are partially embedded into the three-dimensional
(3D) structure of the filters. This facilitates the longer residence
time of Cu particles inside the filter by restricting their escape
into the drinking water and therefore the overdosage of Cu by the
customers. The longer Cu residence time also plays an important role
in preserving the activity, therefore promoting the longevity of the
as-prepared filters. SEM micrographs also indicated that the microsized
Cu spheres are presumably aggregates of nanosized Cu particles; therefore,
we estimated the particle sizes by using the Scherrer equation28 on the basis of the X-ray diffractographs. The
most intensive reflection (111) was evaluated for the estimations,
and they suggest that the average size of the Cu particles is approximately
15 nm. This, combined with the SEM studies, proves that the Cu microspheres
are indeed hierarchical structures of Cu nanoparticles organized into
spheres. To ensure the reproducibility of the functionalization, the
synthesis was repeated without the presence of NFC as well (Figure 1). It is worth noting
that the reflections of this sample are narrower than those in the
presence of cellulose. We estimated that without the presence of cellulose,
the synthesized average Cu particle diameter is 25 nm, which means
approx. 67% of increment compared to that in the previously discussed
case. This particle enlargement shall only be explained by the presence
or lack of NFC. The fibers tend to form aggregates (Figure 1e), and the aggregation is
facilitated by the increased ion concentration in the reaction mixture.29 This aggregation results in temporarily well-defined
micro- or nanocompartments wherein the in situ Cu nanoparticle synthesis
occurs. The fibers stand as obstacles, which delay the equilibration
of the reactant concentrations by steric hindrance. On the other hand,
when no cellulose is present in the reaction mixture, such a steric
hindrance does not occur and the synthesis of the nanoparticles only
ceases when one of the reactants is completely consumed.

Figure 1d shows
that as a result of continuously stirring the reaction mixture, the
distribution of the synthesized hierarchical Cu structures is homogeneous
on the surface of cellulose; significant grouping of the microstructures
is not visible. These hierarchical structures with dimensions of several
micrometers can significantly disrupt the homogeneity of the NFC film
by their intercalation between NFC aggregates. This phenomenon must
be taken into account, as it does not only enhance the permeability
of the membrane but it can seriously influence its stability as well.

N2 adsorption Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
experiments were performed to evaluate the specific surface area,
which was determined to be 6.0 and 2.3 m2/g for pure and
Cu-NFC, respectively. This decreasing tendency is the result of the
strongly promoted aggregation of NFC by the higher ion concentration
in the reaction mixture,29 as an increased
nanoparticle aggregation leads to the decrement of specific surface
area.

The WHO suggests that the safe concentration of copper
in drinking
water is <2 mg/L.30 Samples for inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements have been prepared
to determine the total dissolved Cu content by filtering deionized
water of neutral pH through the membrane under the previously detailed
experimental conditions. The results showed that the sum of the concentration
of 63Cu and 65Cu was 336.4 μg/L; thus,
the dissolution of Cu during filtration does not overstep in extent
the international guidelines.

By analyzing the ζ potential
of NFC, Cu-NFC, and MS2, we
can conclude whether the efficiency of virus retention can be improved
by the functionalization. Fall et al. thoroughly discussed the surface
charge and the ζ potential of pure NFC at different ionic strengths.
At low ionic strengths, where all of our experiments were performed,
NFC exhibits a strong negative ζ potential (below −40
mV).31 If we compare these results to the
ζ potential of MS2, measured by Syngouna et al.32 (between −10 and −30 mV), we can conclude
that the repellence of MS2 from the surface is significant; therefore,
we cannot expect a high virus retention from pure NFC. In contrast
to this, Cu nanoparticles have been shown to have less negative ζ
potential.33 Our dynamic light scattering
(DLS) results showed that the ζ potentials of our Cu-NFC filters
are −18, −24, and −25 mV for pH values of 5.0,
7.5, and 9.0, respectively. This is in agreement with the previously
mentioned literary data; as Michen et al. discussed, positive patches
(or as in our case, Cu patches of less negative ζ potential)
on surfaces with very negative ζ potential can result in a generally
less negative brutto ζ potential.11 These findings mean that the electric properties of the surface
of our Cu-NFC filter are more favorable for the retention of MS2.

2.2 Virus Filtration Experiments
2.1.1 Batch
Experiments
The batch adsorption
experiments revealed that pure NFC retained less than one logarithmic
reduction value of the virions (Table 1). 1Log reduction value (LRV) represents that the reduction
was successful at the extent of 1 magnitude (LRV = Log(initial value)
– Log(final value)).

a The initial PFU concentration was
100 PFU/mL.

The results
of batch experiments where Cu-NFC was applied as adsorbent
showed 0 PFU in all 12 tested plates. This led to the conclusion that
Cu-NFC has a virus adsorption property of at least 2Log under these
conditions. To determine the maximal virus retention capacity of our
material, a higher concentration (103–105 PFU/mL) was also applied in batch experiments. Fifty milligrams
of the Cu-NFC could show a virus retention of up to 3Log (99.9%).
These experimental results reinforce our conclusions that Cu-NFC exhibits
higher virus retention efficiency. The very low but detectable LRV
of pure NFC can come from either steric effects, such as the trapping
of MS2 bacteriophages between aggregates, or from a less negative
secondary energy minimum in the interaction energy profile, such as
the one proposed by Syngouna et al.32

2.1.2 Flow Experiments
The control experiment
was performed without applying our filter to check the possible adsorption
on the glass insert of the funnel. The results showed no measurable
bacteriophage retention. Some of the prototype filters were damaged
in the flow experiments due to the negative differential pressure
applied to enhance the filtration. A virus retention of up to 3Log
could be achieved at pH = 7.5 and 9.0 and up to 4Log at pH = 5.0 (Figure 3) by these filters.

Figure 3 Photograph
of MS2-infected E. coli cultures after
virus filtration with Cu-NFC filters.

The filters containing double amounts of each material (DA
filters)
gave more promising results, as they were also significantly more
stable and could sustain their coherence against the applied negative
differential pressure. The DA filters showed a virus retention of
at least 5 magnitudes at all three pH values, which refers to an efficiency
of at least 99.999% (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Photograph of MS2-infected E. coli cultures after virus filtration with DA Cu-NFC filters.

Samples of the same composition show significantly
distinct antiviral
properties in batch and flow experiments. The only difference is in
the structure and consistency of the adsorbent; therefore, the enhancement
must derive from the scaffold of the membrane. Presumably, water is
able to slacken in the 3D structure of the filters due to their porosity.
Thus, the retention time of a certain volume of filtered liquid is
longer. In these “dead-water pockets”, more contact
time is available for the inactivation of the viruses. Consequently,
this can result in slightly higher local Cu(II) concentration in these
microscopic volumes, which has proven antiviral effects because of
the traces of electrolytically formed hydrogen peroxide21 and possibly due to the potential denaturation
of capside proteins as well.34 The retention
of virions can also be supported by battering to the NFC aggregates
that provides more time for their inactivation. As the continuously
stirred system does not have an organized structure, the virus retention
can only rely on the electric properties of the Cu-NFC surface. We
also assume that an even higher virus retention can occur in normal
drinking water than in this model system, as phosphate ions (present
in the buffer solution) have been discussed to have a negative effect
on the antiviral activity of Cu(II).21

3 Conclusions
In this study, we show
that the preparation of an effective virus
filter based on a cheap organic material (NFC), coated with a small
amount of Cu, was successful, standing as a candidate for a prototype
of a further optimized, high-performance POU virus filter. As Cu coating
reduced the stability of the filter membranes, half the amount of
NFC existed in its pure, nonfunctionalized state in the filters.

The control studies of batch experiments investigated the impact
of stirring on air, the retention by the poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE) membrane used for adsorbent elimination, and the adsorption
by pure NFC. They showed that except for the pure NFC, which demonstrated
a <1Log retention, none of them exhibited any measurable effect
on the virus concentration. The retention by pure NFC was caused by
its direct interaction with MS2 bacteriophages, yet the nature of
this interaction is still not completely clear. In batch experiments
with Cu-NFC, a 3Log virus retention was observed.

Cu-functionalized
filters of 50 mg of NFC were used in the flow
experiments at pH = 5.0, 7.5, and 9.0. Despite their low robustness,
these filters exhibited a virus retention of 3 magnitudes at pH =
7.5 and 9.0 and a retention of 4 magnitudes at pH = 5.0. Using DA
filters, the virus retention exceeded 5 magnitudes (LRV > 5) at
all
three pH values; from these results, we concluded that both the amount
of Cu and the amount of NFC play significant roles in the preparation
of an efficient filter. These findings are highly complementary to
those already present in the scientific literature: not only do they
demonstrate the usefulness of cellulose structures in small-virus
filtration but with a very high initial virus stock concentration
applied in this study, we could represent the removal efficiency based
on exact experimental results, not solely probability.

4 Experimental Section
All sample preparations and experiments
were performed in a sterile
environment in the proximity of a propane–butane laboratory
torch to avoid contamination and therefore false results. To sterilize
them, refractory instruments and sample holders were autoclaved at
121 °C (±1 °C) for at least 20 min. Tools that cannot
be heat-treated were disinfected with ethanol (technical grade).

4.1 Materials
d-Glucose, bacteriological
agar, NaH2PO4·2H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, K-Na-tartrate, and NaOH were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Switzerland). CaCl2·2H2O, NaCl and glycerol were purchased from Merck Eurolab AG
(Switzerland). Streptomycin, tryptone (Difco 0123), and NaCl were
obtained from AppliChem PanReac (Germany), Becton Dickinson AG (Switzerland),
and VWR International (Switzerland), respectively. Elemental Chlorine
Free (ECF) fibers from bleached soft-wood-based pulp-fibers (Picea abies and Pinus spp.) were purchased from Stendal
(Berlin, Germany). Acetone and ethanol were obtained from Thommen
Furler AG (Büren, Switzerland) and Alko Swiss GmbH (Wildegg,
Switzerland), respectively. Ultrapure water (later simply referred
to as water), purified by a Barnstead NANOPure Diamond device (Thermo
Scientific; equipped with an mdi DNSZ capsule filter with the pore
size of 0.1 μm), was used for rinsing and as a solvent.

E. coli (Migula 1895) Castellani and
Chalmers 1919 (DSM No.: 5695) colonies were used as hosts for MS2
bacteriophage propagation (DSM No.: 13767). Dry E.
coli pellets and the MS2 phage suspension were purchased
from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany).

4.2 Media
Preparation and Bacteria Growth
The necessary media for the
growth of bacteria, MS2 propagation,
and filtration (i.e., CaCl2, antibiotic solution, broth,
virus dilution buffer, and hard and soft agar) were prepared as proposed
by Pecson et al.22

The bacteriophages
were propagated in E. coli, then purified
and concentrated in different steps, according to the protocol provided
by DSMZ. The as-received bacteria pellets were rehydrated by 0.5 mL
of the broth for 30 min, after which they were transferred into 5
mL of broth. The E. coli provided by
DSMZ is noncolonial; therefore, a stock was grown from a single bacterium
to reach a colony as uniform as possible. Hundred microliters of the
suspended pellet was pipetted onto a hard agar plate and streaked,
as shown in Figure 5, by a flame-sterilized inoculation loop. The streaking was performed
after a single immersion of the inoculation loop into the pellet suspension.

Figure 5 Schematic
drawing of the streaked lines on a hard agar plate.

The inoculated plate was incubated at 37 °C
for 24 h. After
the incubation, several white dots appeared on the hard agar plate,
each one representing one uniform colony. One of the colonies was
separated and transferred into 25 mL of broth. The suspension was
left at 37 °C to grow, until its optical density measured at
600 nm by spectrophotometry (OD600nm) reached the value
of 0.2. Afterward, a sterile glycerol solution (containing 60 vol
% glycerol and 40 vol % ultrapure water) was added to reach the final
glycerol concentration of 9 vol %, to improve the survival rate of
bacteria at freezing conditions. This suspension was then divided
into 100 μL aliquots. The as-prepared bacterial stocks were
stored at −80 °C for a maximum of 6 months. After a frozen
bacterial colony was thawed and kept at 37 °C for up to 10 min,
the same procedure was applied for the recultivation.

4.3 Determination of MS2 Concentration
As MS2 is inactivated
easily, it is required to regularly determine
the suspension concentration in PFU/mL (PFU stands for plaque forming
units). A dilution series of the original stock was prepared for each
determination process (N2, N4, N6, N8, N9, N10, N11, N12, N13, and
N14, where Nx represents a dilution of 10x times of the original stock). Hundred microliters
of the diluted virus suspension with 200 μL of bacterium suspension
(OD600nm = 0.2) was added to 7 mL of the liquid soft agar
that was previously kept at 56 °C. After homogenization, the
suspension was poured onto a hard agar plate at room temperature and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Following the incubation, the amount
of active MS2 bacteriophages was determined by the well-known method:
counting the transparent circles in the opaque white bacterium layer,
caused by the phage infection. Each circle represented one PFU of
the bacteriophage (Figure 6). The concentration of the original MS2 stock (5 × 106 PFU/mL) was calculated from the number of the infection zones
considering the used volumes and concentrations.

continuous layer of E. coli (a) and
an infected culture counting 95 PFUs (b).

4.4 Functionalization of NFC
To prepare
the NFC suspension of approximately 1.5 wt %, 2% ECF aqueous suspension
was processed by a “Supermass Colloider” (MKZA10-20J
CE) equipped with nonporous grinding stones rotating at the nominal
velocity of approximately 1500 rpm (at the motor load of 15 kW). The
instrument was purchased from Masuko Sangyo Co., Ltd. (Kawaguchi/Saitama,
Japan).

Metallic Cu particles were synthesized in situ in the
presence of NFC by Fehling’s reaction23 by applying an excess reductive agent. NFC suspension (7.500 g,
containing approximately 150 mg NFC) was diluted with 30 mL of deionized
water; then, 0.456 g of CuSO4·5H2O, 1.380
g of K-Na-tartrate, and 4.200 g of NaOH were added to the suspension.
This suspension was stirred at 350 rpm for 30 min by a magnetic stirrer,
followed by adding of 0.5 mL of formaldehyde (aqueous solution with
the concentration of 37 wt %). The temperature was set to 60 °C,
and the mixture was stirred for another 60 min. The synthesis of Cu
particles became visible as the previously blue mixture turned deep
reddish brown. The as-prepared sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm
for 1 min; then, the supernatant was removed and water was added to
the sediment. This step was introduced to reach neutral pH that is
important to prevent the degradation of cellulose chains in a strongly
basic environment. After the redispersion of the sediment, the previously
described washing process was repeated twice and the sediment was
resuspended in water, eventually. The as-prepared material is referred
to as Cu-NFC in further discussions.

4.5 Preparation
of the Nanopaper-Based Filter
Pure cellulose nanopapers were
prepared by the “paper-making”
method as follows. NFC suspension (6.67 g, containing approximately
100 mg of NFC) was diluted to 30–40 mL by adding water, and
it was subsequently filtered through a Durapore poly(vinylidene difluoride)
membrane with the uniform pore size of 0.1 μm. The filtration
process was enhanced by a Divac 1.2 L vacuum pump. The membrane with
the filter cake was dried on air after eliminating as much water as
possible. The resulting white, nontransparent, flexible cellulose
nanopaper spontaneously detached from the filter membrane. In preliminary
experiments, these pure cellulose nanopaper membranes (Figure 1a) showed relatively low water
permeability because cellulose fibers adsorb water and swell, reducing
the size of the pores accessible for the liquid. Studies have shown
that the permeability of the nanopaper can be regulated by using different
solvents.17 To avoid losing the size-exclusion
effect during the filtration, a method for controlling the pore size
distribution in NFC papers has been developed and proven in a previous
study.24

Nanopapers prepared by the
above-described method of Cu-modified NFC were conveniently permeable
for water filtration. However, they were significantly more fragile
than the membranes made of pure NFC. To achieve a sufficient permeability
and enhance the mechanical properties of the final filter, the 50–50
vol % mixture of modified and unmodified NFC was used for fabrication.

The experimental setup was planned for membranes with 25 nm diameter,
containing 50–100 mg of NFC in total. The mixture of modified
and unmodified NFC was suspended in water; then, the water was removed
by vacuum filtration. Afterward, the wet filter was washed with either
ethanol or acetone with the use of vacuum filtration. After two repetition
cycles, water was considered to be eliminated from the filter cake,
which was dried on air for 10–15 min afterward. When ethanol
was used as a washing agent, the resulting permeability of the filter
material was insufficient, whereas in the case of acetone, the permeability
improved. By using this method, a cellulose nanopaper containing 50
mg of cellulose (25 mg of Cu-NFC) was prepared (Figure 1b) with sufficient permeability to perform
filtration experiments. Not only the solvent but the amount of Cu-modified
NFC also affected the stability and permeability of the filters. The
same filters were prepared with 12.5 and 37.5 mg of Cu-NFC as well;
the former prototype had very low permeability, which would make its
use unfavorable, whereas the latter one was too brittle and broke
during the filtration. On the basis of these factors, we decided to
conduct the further virus filtration experiments with the 50 mg of
cellulose filter, with 25 mg of Cu-NFC.

To determine the potential
influence of the thickness of the nanopaper,
the quantity of all of the materials used for filter preparation was
doubled in subsequent experiments. The filters prepared in such a
way are referred to as “DA filters” (DA stands for double
amount) in further discussions.

4.6 Virus
Adsorption Experiments
4.6.1 Batch Experiments
Batch experiments
were performed in a 250 mL glass beaker with continuous stirring (300
rpm by a magnetic stirrer) at pH = 7.5. Two hundred milliliters of
the virus dilution buffer and 50 mg of the adsorbent (either pure
or Cu-NFC) was added to the beaker and stirred for 5 min. Next, 20
μL of the original virus stock was pipetted into the mixture
(leading to the concentration of 500 PFU/mL) and the beaker was covered
with Parafilm M. From this point, samples (1 mL) were collected every
5 min to determine the concentration of active MS2 bacteriophages.
Each batch experiment was performed for 20 min. The collected samples
were filtered through Rotilabo PTFE syringe filters of 25 mm diameter,
with the uniform pore size of 5.0 μm, to remove adsorbents from
the suspension; thus, we could prevent further virus adsorption after
sample collection. We confirmed experimentally that neither this filtration
step (by possible adsorption on PTFE membrane) nor the exposure to
air (causing the inactivation of bacteriophages) influences the virus
concentration to an extent that is higher than its observable biostatistical
fluctuation. Following the filtration, 100 μL of the purified
infected liquid and 200 μL of bacterium suspension were transferred
into approximately 7 mL of soft agar, previously kept at 56 °C;
then, the active virus concentration was determined by the previously
described method. Every experiment was performed three times to prove
reproducibility.

So as to determine the maximal logarithmic
removal rate of the filter materials, the batch experiments were repeated
with the increased starting concentration of MS2 of 1014 PFU/mL, which was 107 times more concentrated than that
of Metreveli et al.18 This allowed the
experimental determination of LRV values at the maximal possible precision
allowed by our samples of biological nature.

4.6.2 Flow
Experiments
In flow experiments,
the as-prepared filter was placed into a 30 mL glass funnel with a
porous glass insert at the bottom. Vacuum suction was applied to enhance
the flux of the filtered liquid. A control experiment was also performed
without a filter to investigate the influence of the equipment on
the retention of the bacteriophages, given that the system is porous.
Thirty milliliters of the virus dilution buffer was infected with
the calculated volume of bacteriophage stock to reach the active phage
concentration of 105 PFU/mL. This allowed the investigation
of retention of up to 5 magnitudes (5Log). Separate experiments were
performed both with membranes containing 25 mg of pure NFC and 25
mg of Cu-NFC and with the DA filters. One milliliter of the filtered
liquid was collected after each filtration and used to infect E. coli for virus enumeration.

The flow experiments
were performed at three different pH values: 5.0, 7.5, and 9.0, respectively,
to simulate real-life situations.

4.7 Characterization
Methods
The crystalline
structure of the membranes was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
by a PANalytical X’Pert Pro MPD machine operating with Cu Kα
(λ = 1.5405 Å) radiation. The X-ray scanning was performed
over a 2θ range of 10–80°, with a step size of 0.0167°.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies were performed in a
FEI Nova NanoSEM 230 that operated in the 10–15 kV range, after
the samples were attached to a conductive carbon tape and sputtered
by Leica EM ACE 200 sputter coater with a 5 nm thick platinum layer.

The specific surface area of the samples was determined by single-point
BET measurements (Coulter SA3100) carried out at 77 K. The samples
were pretreated at 300 °C for 15 min in helium flow (50 cm3/min).

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) measurements
were performed in an Agilent 7500 ce ICP-MS device to determine the
amount of Cu dissolved during filtration.

ζ Potential
values were defined by using laser Doppler electrophoresis
(DLS, Zetasizer Nano S, Malvern Instruments) and solid surface ζ
potentiometry (Anton-Paar SurPASS Electrokinetic Analyzer).
