In this work, we report that superhydrophobic
coatings can be prepared
by a simple spray-coating technique using readily available materials
such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and hydrophilic and hydrophobic
SiO2 nanoparticles. PDMS can combine with the two kinds
of SiO2 nanoparticles to form a rough structure, which
results in superhydrophobicity of the coatings. The prepared superhydrophobic
coating has a water contact angle of 156.4° and a sliding angle
of less than 5°. Moreover, the coatings can be applied to various
substrates such as glass, paper, and plastic. In addition, the coatings
show excellent stability and still remain superhydrophobic after ultraviolet
radiation, sand abrasion and water impact, tape peeling, and treatment
with a strong alkali/acid solution. Furthermore, the superhydrophobic
surfaces are proven to be suitable for antifouling and self-cleaning.

1 Introduction
Recently,
specially designed functional surfaces such as superhydrophobic
surfaces, inspired by the “lotus effect” in nature,
have attracted extensive attention because of their widespread application
in materials science and engineering technology.1−12 A superhydrophobic surface exhibits extremely high water resistance:
the static contact angle of water is larger than 150° and the
dynamic sliding angle is smaller than 10°.13−15 Superhydrophobic
surfaces are generally created by a micro–nanostructured rough
surface and low-surface-energy material modification.9,16−25 As water repellency is important in practical applications including
self-cleaning,26−28 oil–water separation,29−37 corrosion protection,38 and anti-icing,39 there are a number of research works on superhydrophobic
surfaces. For example, Ge et al.40 reported
that a transparent and superamphiphobic surface could be created from
strings of amphiphilic silica nanoparticles dispersed in an amphiphilic
sol solution by a one-step spray-coating method. Li et al.41 fabricated a translucent and superhydrophobic
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) coating on a glass substrate by introducing
roughness using SiO2 nanoparticles with an aerosol-assisted
chemical vapor deposition method. Wu et al.42 synthesized emulsions by a one-step method using nanoparticles,
PTES, waterborne epoxy resin, and ethanol and prepared an environmentally
friendly and stable superhydrophobic film by simply spraying them
on the surface of a substrate. Although research on superhydrophobic
surfaces has made significant progress, most preparation methods are
still complicated, requiring special conditions and/or expensive equipment,
which limit their practical application.

For superhydrophobic
surfaces, high transparency is a requirement
in many practical applications.4,43−52 As we know, the transparency of coatings generally becomes worse
when the surface roughness increases because light scattering occurs
when light strikes the rough surface, causing the surface to exhibit
translucence or opaqueness. Therefore, light scattering can be attenuated
by reducing the roughness of the surface, making the surface transparent.53 Previous studies on transparent and durable
superhydrophobic surfaces were mainly related to carbon derivatives,
polymers, and silicon nanoparticles.54 Gao
et al.55 reported that a superhydrophobic
surface could be obtained using PDMS as the binder, tetrahydrofuran
as the solvent, and water as the nonsolvent by phase separation. Results
showed that transmittance decreased by less than 10%. Alawajji et
al.56 successfully fabricated transparent
superhydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene thin films using pulsed laser
deposition with various deposition times at room temperature, and
the transmission rate could be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, although
the desired hydrophobicity and transparency were obtained, the robustness
and wear resistance of the film were not good because of the flexibility
of the polymer.

In this paper, we present a simple, fast, and
environmentally friendly
one-step spray coating method for preparing superhydrophobic coatings
on different substrates using readily available materials such as
PDMS and SiO2 nanoparticles. When hydrophilic SiO2 and hydrophobic SiO2 nanoparticles are mixed in a certain
ratio and blended with PDMS, a roughly hierarchical micro–nanostructured
surface can be obtained, wherein PDMS is used as both a low surface
energy modifier and an adhesive. After being exposed to ultraviolet
(UV) light for 72 h, peeled off for 250 cycles by a tape, and immersed
in a strong acid/base solution for 72 h, the superhydrophobic coatings
still show good water resistance, revealing good durability. In addition,
the coatings can maintain sufficient transparency, allowing them to
be used in a wide range of applications. Based on their excellent
superhydrophobicity and lipophilicity, the coatings can be used for
large-scale applications in self-cleaning and oil–water separation.

2 Experimental Work
2.1 Materials
PDMS
was purchased from
Toshiba Moto, Japan. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and hexane were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ditin butyl dilaurate
(C32H64O4Sn) and hydrophilic fumed
nanosilica (7–40 nm) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical
Co., Ltd. Hydrophobic gas-phase nanosilica (7–40 nm) was purchased
from Aladdin Biotechnology Corporation.

2.2 Preparation
of Superhydrophobic Solution
First, a certain amount of PDMS
was dissolved in 20 mL of n-hexane; an appropriate
amount of TEOS and ditin butyl
dilaurate (mass ratio of PDMS/TEOS was 10:1) was added, and ultrasonication
was performed for several minutes. Subsequently, hydrophilic and hydrophobic
silica were added to the solution in a certain ratio, and the total
mass of the silica was maintained at 0.1 g. Finally, the solution
was sonicated for 15 min.

2.3 Preparation of Superhydrophobic
Films on Various
Substrates by Spray-Coating
The glass substrate was repeatedly
washed several times with deionized water and alcohol and dried in
an oven. The prepared superhydrophobic suspension was spray-coated
onto the surface of the substrates at a spray pressure of 5 psi for
one cycle. Otherwise, the coating is too thick resulting in a decrease
in transmittance. The prepared sample was placed in a room temperature
environment for 1 h to obtain a superhydrophobic coating. In order
to more clearly describe the prepared process, the complete process
is shown in Figure 1a. As shown in Figure 1a, when PDMS and the curing agent are spray-coated on the substrate,
the contact angle of the water droplets on the surface is only about
100°. Once hydrophilic nanosilica particles (red particles in Figure 1a) are added to the
solvent, the nanoparticles may agglomerate because the surface of
the hydrophilic nanoparticles has a hydroxyl group. Hydrophobic nanoparticles
are continuously added to the solution, and the hydrophobic nanoparticles
are not connected to the hydrophilic nanoparticles because the surface
is modified. However, when PDMS is added to the nanoparticle solution,
the hydrophobic nanoparticles are connected to the hydrophilic nanoparticles
under the action of the adhesive PDMS. Eventually, the contact angle
of the water droplets on the surface of the substrate can reach above
150°.

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of a process for preparing a superhydrophobic suspension
and a semitransparent superhydrophobic coating. (b) FTIR spectra of
hydrophilic and hydrophobic SiO2.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra from 500 to 4000 cm–1 of hydrophilic and hydrophobic SiO2@glass
coatings are shown in Figure 1b. Hydrophobic nanoparticles are obtained by surface modification
with hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS). At 3433 cm–1,
both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nano-SiO2 have strong
absorption peaks. The absorption peak at 3643 cm–1 reflects the stretching vibration of N–H bonds of the hydrophobic
nanoparticles and the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl groups
of the hydrophilic nanoparticles. The absorption peak at 2964 cm–1 reflects the stretching vibration of Si–CH3 of HMDS. A very high intensity absorption peak can be detected
at 1097 cm–1 because of the asymmetric stretching
of Si–O–Si. The absorption peaks at 812 and 847 cm–1 are derived from the stretching vibration of the
Si–N bond in HMDS.

2.4 Characterization
The surface morphology
of the coating was investigated by a JSM-IT300 field emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM). Elemental analysis was obtained from
an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) device connected to the FESEM.
Infrared spectra of the substrates before and after coating were recorded
using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer. The static contact angle and
sliding angle of the droplets were measured using a contact angle
meter (Theta Lite, Biolin Scientific), and the volume of each droplet
was 2 μL. A Shimadzu ultraviolet–visible near infrared
spectrophotometer was used to measure the optical transmittance of
the coating.

2.5 Durability Testing
In order to study
the durability of the prepared superhydrophobic coatings, various
experiments were conducted including the tape peeling test, the UV
resistance test, and the corrosion resistance test. The static contact
angle and the sliding angle were recorded to show that the coating
remained superhydrophobic. The tape peeling test was conducted using
an ordinary tape to investigate the adhesion between the superhydrophobic
coating and the substrate, and the contact angle and sliding angle
were measured every 50 cycles. In order to study the aging resistance
of the sample under UV irradiation, the sample was exposed to UV light
for 72 h, and the contact angle and sliding angle were recorded every
12 h. The corrosion resistance test was carried out by immersing the
superhydrophobic coatings in hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide
solution (pH from 1 to 14) for 72 h, and then the contact angle and
sliding angle of the soaked samples were measured.

2.6 Self-Cleaning Ability
In order to
prove the self-cleaning property of the prepared superhydrophobic
films, black carbon powder was selected as the model dust and put
on the surface of the film. The superhydrophobic film was tilted with
a certain angle in a Petri dish. Then, water droplets were dropped
on the superhydrophobic film. The water droplets could pick up and
remove the toner.

2.7 Sand Drop Abrasion and
Water Drop Impact
During the sand drop abrasion test, 10,
30, and 50 g of sand particles
with a particle size of about 0.4 mm were dropped from a height of
50 cm and impinged on the superhydrophobic coating for 30 s. In the
water droplet impact experiment, at a height of 50 cm above the superhydrophobic
coating, 5,000 water droplets (∼2 μL each) were dropped,
and the contact angle of the hydrophobic layer was recorded.

3 Results and Discussion
Figure 2a illustrates
the preparation of a superhydrophobic surface by a simple spray-coating
method. As shown in Figure 2b, the prepared superhydrophobic coatings could be applied
to different substrates such as glass, plastic, and paper. In order
to create a suitable micro–nano structure, we studied the effect
of different ratios of hydrophilic SiO2 to hydrophobic
SiO2 on the surface structure of the coatings. Figure 3 shows the typical
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of coatings with different
ratios of hydrophilic SiO2 to hydrophobic SiO2. The results showed that the ratio of hydrophilic SiO2 to hydrophobic SiO2 had a great influence on the surface
structure of the coating. When the ratio was 1:5, nanoparticles aggregated
to form many small clusters, and the size of the clusters was small
(Figure 3a). As the
fraction of hydrophilic nano-SiO2 increased, nanoparticles
began to aggregate to form irregularly big clusters. Once the ratio
was 4:2, the amount of nanoparticles and the size of clusters deposited
on the glass surface increased dramatically (Figure 3c). However, when the fraction of hydrophilic
SiO2 further increased and reached 5:1, the amount of nanoparticles
and the size of clusters became small again (Figure 3d). Figure 3e shows the typical EDS spectrum and the elemental
ratio of the coating. The surface mainly contained C, O, and Si elements,
and the atomic ratios were 0.4, 43.73, and 55.86%, respectively. The
content of Si significantly increased compared to that of pristine
glass.

spectrum and elemental
ratio of a coating.

In order to investigate
the relationship between the amount of
PDMS and the superhydrophobicity of the coating, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and
2.0 g of PDMS were added to the solutions containing 0.1 g of SiO2 nanoparticles (the ratio of hydrophilic SiO2 to
hydrophobic SiO2 was 1:1). It could be seen from the SEM
image that when the amount of PDMS was 0.5 g, nanoparticles on the
surface of the glass substrate aggregated and the cluster size became
large (Figure 4a).
The coating showed significant superhydrophobicity. However, as the
amount of PDMS increased (e.g., 1.5 g), although the amount of nanoparticles
on the substrate surface did not reduce, the surface of the particles
was covered by PDMS and became smooth. The coating lost superhydrophobicity
(Figure 4c). The morphology
difference between the blank glass and the superhydrophobic coating
surface could be seen from the SEM images (Figure S1).

g of PDMS. (e) FTIR diagram of PDMS@glass and PDMS/hydrophilic and
hydrophobic SiO2.

Figure 4e shows
the FTIR plots of PDMS@glass coating and PDMS/hydrophilic and hydrophobic
SiO2@glass coatings from 500 to 4000 cm–1. Results proved that SiO2 and PDMS could be connected
together. The absorption peaks at 2965 and 1263 cm–1 reflected the asymmetric stretching and deformation of CH3 in Si–CH3 of PDMS. The absorption peaks at 806
and 799 cm–1 represented the Si–(CH3)2 stretching vibration of PDMS. A very high intensity
absorption peak could be detected at 1019 cm–1,
which was ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of Si–O–Si.
The absorption peak at 865 cm–1 proved that PDMS
and SiO2 were completely connected.

It is well known
that the hydrophobicity of a coating depends on
its surface topography and surface energy. In this work, we used hydrophobic
and hydrophilic silica nanoparticles to create high surface roughness
and used PDMS as a low-surface-energy agent and an adhesive to prepare
superhydrophobic coatings. In order to investigate the relationship
between the wettability of the surface coating (contact angle and
sliding angle) and the preparing conditions (the ratio of hydrophilic
to hydrophobic silica nanoparticles to the amount of PDMS), we carried
out a series of experiments. As shown in Figure 5a, when the amount of PDMS was 1 g and the
total amount of silica was 0.1 g, as the proportion of hydrophobic
silica increased, the water contact angle increased first and then
decreased. However, the sliding angle first decreased and then increased.
When the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic silica was 4:2 and 3:3,
the coating showed good superhydrophobicity. However, the coating
had a water contact angle lower than 150° and a sliding angle
larger than 10° in other ratios; even when the ratio of hydrophilic
to hydrophobic SiO2 was 1:5 and 0:6, the sliding angle
was larger than 50°. This is because the surface roughness of
the coating is not high enough under these conditions.

angles and sliding angles with (a) the
ratio of SiO2 nanoparticles and (c) the amount of PDMS.
(b) Relationship between transparency and PDMS amount in the nanoparticle
ratio of 3:3. (d) Relationship between transparency and nanoparticle
ratio when the amount of PDMS was 1 g.

In addition, we also studied the effect of the amount of PDMS on
the wettability of the coating when the total amount of hydrophilic
and hydrophobic silica was 0.1 g and the ratio was 3:3. It can be
seen from Figure 5c
that as the amount of PDMS increased, the contact angle of the coating
decreased and the sliding angle increased. When the amount of PDMS
was 0.5 and 1 g, the contact angle of the coating was larger than
150° and the sliding angle was lower than 5°. Under this
condition, the coating showed obvious superhydrophobicity. However,
as the amount of PDMS increased, the hydrophobicity of the coating
gradually decreased. When the amount of PDMS reached 1.5 g, the contact
angle of the coating was lower than 150° and the sliding angle
was larger than 10°, revealing that the coating lost superhydrophobicity.
This is because as the amount of PDMS increases, more PDMS covers
the surface of the nanoparticles, reducing the surface roughness.
According to the previous report, hydrophilic silica nanoparticles
possess many OH– groups which cause nanoparticles
to aggregate,57 whereas hydrophobic silica
nanoparticles contain many hydrophobic groups which make nanoparticles
disperse better. Thus, the appropriate ratio of hydrophobic nanoparticles
to hydrophilic nanoparticles will cause hydrophilic nanoparticles
to form appropriate microstructured aggregation, which can create
a good rough surface, resulting in a superhydrophobic surface.

The transmittance of the sample prepared was measured. Blank glass
had an approximate 92% visible light transmission. It can be seen
from Figure 5b that
as the ratio of hydrophilic to hydrophobic nanoparticles was fixed
and the amount of PDMS increased, the transmittance of the coating
increased in the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm. When the amount
of PDMS was 2.0 g, the coating transmittance at this time was the
highest (about 70%). Once the amount of PDMS decreased to 0.5 g, the
visible light transmittance of the coating was less than 10%. However,
at this time, the coating exhibited the most hydrophobicity. When
the amount of PDMS reduced to 1 g, the coating at this time showed
superhydrophobicity, but the transmittance reduced to 40%. The transmittance
of the coating was also studied in different ratios of hydrophilic
to hydrophobic nanoparticles. In general, superhydrophobicity and
transparency are in a competitive relationship depending on the thickness
and surface structure of the coating. As shown in Figure 5d, when the ratio was 1:5,
the coating had the highest transmittance. When the ratio increased
to 4:2, the coating had the best hydrophobicity, but the transmittance
was less than 10%. This is because when the ratio of hydrophilic SiO2 to hydrophobic SiO2 was 4:2, the surface roughness
of the coating reached the maximum value at this time. The results
of the transparency test were comparable to SEM, contact angle, and
sliding angle tests.

The mechanical instability of the superhydrophobic
coatings is
the main factor limiting their practical application. Here, we studied
the stability of the coating by exposing it to UV light, peeling it
off by a tape, and immersing it in a corrosive solution (strong acid/base).
As shown in Figure 6a, after the prepared superhydrophobic coating (the mass ratio of
hydrophilic SiO2 to hydrophobic SiO2 was 4:2,
and the amount of PDMS was 1 g) was exposed to UV light for 72 h,
there was no significant change in the hydrophobicity of the coating
during the entire UV light irradiation, and the coating still kept
good superhydrophobicity. This should be attributed to the fact that
both PDMS and SiO2 have excellent UV stability and are
not easily degraded under UV irradiation. Moreover, we tested the
adhesion of the coating to the substrate by repeatedly applying an
adhesive tape to the surface of the coating. It can be seen that after
being peeled off 250 times, the contact angle of the coating did not
change substantially throughout the experiment, the contact angle
of the coating was always larger than 150°, and the coating remained
superhydrophobic (Figure 6b). In addition, it can be seen from the SEM image (Figure 6d) that the surface
structure of the coating was not destroyed after 250 times of tape
peeling, which proved the good stability of the coating.

(nanoparticle ratio was 4:2, and the amount of PDMS was 1 g) for (a)
various times and (b) tape peeling for different cycles. (c) Changes
in the contact angle and sliding angle when the superhydrophobic film
was immersed in hydrochloric acid solution or sodium hydroxide solution
(pH = 1–14) for 72 h; SEM image (d) after tape peeling for
250 cycles and (e,f) for samples immersed in HCl solution (pH = 2)
and NaOH solution (pH = 14) for 72 h.

Corrosion test was carried out by immersing the prepared superhydrophobic
coating samples (hydrophilic SiO2/hydrophobic SiO2 = 4:2, PDMS was 1 g) into a hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide
solution (pH from 1 to 14) for 72 h. As can be seen from Figure 6c, the effect on
the coating was relatively small. The contact angle of the coating
was still larger than 150°; but when the pH reached 12–14,
the contact angle of the coating decreased slightly. From the SEM
image (Figure 7e,f),
we could see that the coating had no obvious change in the surface
morphology after being treated in a solution of pH = 2 and pH = 14
for 72 h, respectively. This may be because the superhydrophobicity
of the coating surface prevents the corrosive solution from contacting
with the surface of the coating, so the surface layer of the coating
is not corroded.

Figure 7 Self-cleaning process of (a–c) superhydrophobic
coating
and (d–f) blank glass. (g,h) Corresponding schematic illustration
of the self-cleaning process.

Water resistance is one of the most important properties of superhydrophobic
coatings (Figure S2); the self-cleaning
performance can effectively make the substrate (such as glass and
plastic) automatically keep the surface clean with rain. Here, the
self-cleaning properties of superhydrophobic coatings were studied
using sand particles with a particle size of 0.4 mm as a model pollutant/dust.
As shown in Figure 7a–c, some sand was deposited on a glass-based superhydrophobic
coating. Water droplets were stained with methyl blue for comparison.
During the self-cleaning process, the water droplets could pick up
and remove the sand when rolling off the superhydrophobic surface
because of superhydrophobicity and a small sliding angle, leaving
a clean surface (Figure 7g,h). In contrast, when the uncoated glass was subjected to the same
treatment (Figure 7d–f), the surface clearly retained traces of water droplets,
and the sand slid with the water droplets which made the surface dirtier.

Mechanical durability is a key issue for the application of superhydrophobic
coatings in practice. However, for superhydrophobic coatings, it is
necessary to create a rough structure on the surface. However, the
roughness can be easily destroyed during the wear process, resulting
in poor durability of the coating. In recent studies, sand abrasion
and water drop impact tests are often used to test the mechanical
durability of coatings on substrates. The experiments on sand abrasion
depend mainly on the quality and height of the sand. In our case (Figure 8a), 10, 30, and 50
g of sand grains with an average particle size of 0.4 mm were naturally
dropped at a height of 50 cm, and the sand hit the superhydrophobic
surface for 30 s. The surface morphologies of the surface after 10
g and 30 g sand abrasion were checked with SEM images (Figure S3). Even after the coating was hit by
50 g of sand grains, the microstructure of the surface was not destroyed
(Figure 8c). Therefore,
there was almost no change in the contact angle of the coating (Figure 8e–g). The
coating still showed superhydrophobicity.

Figure 8 (a) Sketch of the setup
for sand abrasion test; (b) schematic diagram
of the setup for water droplet impact test; (c) SEM image of the superhydrophobic
surface after the sand abrasion test with 50 g sand; (d) SEM image
of the superhydrophobic surface after the water droplet impact test;
water droplet contact angle after sand abrasion with (e) 10, (f) 30,
and (g) 50 g; (h) contact angle after water droplet impact.

In the water drop impact test (Figure 8b), approximately 5000 water
droplets were
dropped from 50 cm above the coating for 2 h to test the stability
of the coating. After the impact of water droplets, the coating still
showed good superhydrophobicity (Figure 8h). According to the SEM image after water
impact (Figure 8d),
we could see that the surface structure almost did not change, revealing
good water impact resistance. In order to study the effect of PDMS
on the wear resistance of the coating, the same test was carried out
on the coating entirely consisting of SiO2. From the SEM
image (Figure S4), it could be found that
in the absence of PDMS, the surface structures after sand abrasion
and water impact were severely damaged and the contact angle was greatly
reduced, indicating that PDMS enhances the stability and hydrophobicity
of the coating.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
we successfully fabricated semitransparent and stable
superhydrophobic coatings on various substrates such as glass, plastic,
and paper. In the preparation process, we prepared the coatings by
simple environmentally friendly materials with a spray-coating method.
The rough structure with a low surface energy made these coatings
excellent superhydrophobic with a water contact angle of 156.4°
and a sliding angle of lower than 5°. After the coatings were
subjected to UV radiation, tape peeling, sand abrasion, water droplet
impact, and strong acid/base corrosion, they still exhibited good
superhydrophobicity. In addition, glass-based superhydrophobic coatings
endowed them good transparency. The prepared superhydrophobic surface
had a low adhesion to water, and the water droplets could easily roll
off from a slightly titled surface. Based on the above characteristics,
this technology is expected to be used in the fields of engineering
materials, self-cleaning glass, oil–water separation, corrosion
protection, and so on.
