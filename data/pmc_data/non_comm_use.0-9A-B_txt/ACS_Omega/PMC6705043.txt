Recently, the use
of mRNA-based vaccines for cancer immunotherapy
has gained growing attention. Several studies have shown that mRNA
delivered in a vectorized format can generate a robust and efficient
immune response. In this work, a new lipopolyplex vector (multi-LP),
incorporating the immune adjuvant α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)
and a multivalent cationic lipid, was proposed for the in vivo delivery
of mRNA into antigen-presenting cells. We demonstrate that dendritic
cells (DCs) can be targeted in vivo by intravenous administration
of a α-GalCer-/mRNA-loaded multi-LP vector, without the need
for its functionalization with cell-specific antibodies or ligands.
The multi-LP nanoparticles loaded with a reporter mRNA efficiently
led to high expression of the enhanced green fluorescence protein
in DCs both in vitro and in vivo, exhibiting an intrinsic selectivity
for DCs. Finally, the TRP2-mRNA/α-GalCer-based multi-LP vaccine
induced a significant therapeutic effect against a highly malignant
B16-F10 melanoma tumor. This study provides the first evidence that
a combination of antigen-mRNA and α-GalCer can be used as an
effective antitumor vaccine, inducing strong innate and adaptive immune
responses.

1 Introduction
Cancer immunotherapy is
a therapeutic strategy that exploits the
natural ability of the immune system to recognize and kill cancer
cells.1 Several cancer immunotherapies
have been proposed such as vaccines and antibody- and cell-based therapies.2−4 Vaccines, compared to other immunotherapies, offer the advantage
of promoting both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and,
more importantly, they can create immunological memory, which could
ensure the promotion of an immunological response of greater magnitude
and faster kinetics in the case of tumor recurrence.5

Nucleic acids have been extensively investigated
in the context
of vaccine development for the priming of tumor-specific cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs).6−8 The use of nucleic acid-based vaccines is a novel
approach developed to address the issues associated with more traditional
antigen forms, such as proteins and peptides. They are easily produced,
provide opportunities for molecular engineering, and have the potential
to promote both innate and adaptive immune responses.7,9 Moreover, unlike peptide-based vaccines, nucleic acid-based vaccines
expressing complete genes are not a priori human leucocyte antigen
(HLA)-restricted.7,9

Particularly, mRNA-based
vaccines are attractive because they retain
the same appealing characteristics of DNA-based vaccines and also
offer additional benefits, such as superior immunogenicity, and, unlike
DNA, mRNA only needs to gain entry to the cytoplasm, where translation
occurs, in order to achieve cell transfection.8−10 Moreover, mRNA
does not have any risk of integration into the genome and therefore
has no oncogenic potential and can be easily synthesized.10 Finally, mRNA can act not only as a source for
antigen but also as an adjuvant by providing costimulatory signals,
for example, via toll-like receptor (TLR) 3, TLR7, and TLR8, to amplify
the immune response.8,10 The main challenge associated
with the use of mRNA for vaccine development is its sensitivity toward
catalytic hydrolysis by omnipresent ribonucleases.9,10 Unprotected
mRNA is highly unstable under physiological conditions and hence unsuitable
for broad therapeutic applications. Because of the potential advantages
of mRNA-based vaccines, intense efforts have been made toward the
stabilization of mRNA in vivo.9,11 Several strategies
have been proposed for mRNA delivery, including viral vectors and
nonviral vectors.12−19

Nonviral vectors represent a simple, flexible, and, more importantly,
safer alternative to viral vectors. Thanks to their relatively simple
quantitative production and their low host immunogenicity, nonviral
vectors are attractive tools in vaccine strategies. With the development
of new biocompatible materials and innovative fabrication approaches,
nonviral vectors are becoming the preferred vehicle to deliver mRNA.
A variety of nonviral vectors have been explored as platforms for
mRNA-based vaccine development, focusing mainly on the use of lipids
and polymers.20−26

An additional advantage associated with the use of nonviral
vectors
for vaccine development is that they can facilitate codelivery of
antigens with adjuvants, enhancing significantly the therapeutic efficacy
of the vaccine.27−30 The codelivery of antigens with adjuvants has been extensively investigated
for peptide-based vaccines, but little is known whether mRNA-based
vaccines may benefit from its combination with vaccine adjuvants.
In this framework, α-GalCer represents an optimal new class
of vaccine adjuvant as it acts as an effective link between innate
and adaptive antitumor immunity. Indeed, α-GalCer, also known
as KRN7000, is an invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell antigen presented
on CD1d of antigen-presenting cells (APCs).31−33 Previous studies
have reported that α-GalCer shows stronger ability to generate
antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, compared to TLR ligands.29,34,35 In response to α-GalCer,
invariant iNKT cells rapidly produce immunostimulatory cytokines,
particularly interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and elicit the induction
of several costimulatory molecules.31−33 These events promote
the activation APCs, which release key Th1 cytokines (e.g., interleukin
(IL)-12), and the downstream activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells and B cells, with important
effects on the magnitude and effectiveness of the immune responses.31−33 Despite this, there is a limitation for the clinical application
of α-GalCer; its poor hydrophilicity makes it essential to incorporate
α-GalCer into a vector in order to improve its solubility, uptake,
and immunogenicity.29,36,37 In addition, it has been demonstrated that vectorization of α-GalCer
can prevent iNKT cell anergy, which usually occurs after repeated
injections of α-GalCer.29,35,36,38

In this study, we have
developed a lipopolyplex vector termed multi-LP,
which consists of a poly-(β-amino ester) polymer (PbAE)/mRNA
polyplex core entrapped into a lipid shell composed of multivalent
cationic lipid (MLV5), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(DOPE), DSPE-PEG, and α-GalCer. In the multi-LP platform, the
cationic polymer condenses the mRNA into a polyplex nanoparticle by
electrostatic interaction. A lipid shell is included in the system
to improve mRNA delivery into dendritic cells (DCs) and to enhance
the immune response because of the adjuvant activity mediated by α-GalCer.39 The resulting construct can not only protect
mRNA molecules in the polyplex core structure from RNase attack but
also be efficiently internalized by DCs, promoting the release of
mRNA molecules to the cytosol for antigen translation.

Here,
the nanovaccine was prepared by co-loading into the carrier
system α-GalCer and antigen-mRNA coding for tyrosinase-related
protein 2 (TRP2) and was tested in a poorly immunogenic and highly
aggressive B16-F10 murine melanoma model, generated by injecting the
tumor cells into syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.40

protein (eGFP)-mRNA, Cy5-mRNA, ovalbumin (OVA)-mRNA, and luciferase
(LUC)-mRNA were purchased from TriLink Biotechnologies. Six to eight
week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River (Canada).

2.2 Synthesis of PbAE
The PbAE was synthesized
in a two-step reaction procedure as previously described.22,41 In the first step, the base polymer (B4S4) was synthesized by mixing
1,4-butanediol diacrylate (B4) (Sigma-Aldrich) with 5-amino-1-pentanol
(S4) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a molar ratio of B4/S4 = 1.2:1. The reaction
was maintained at 90 °C and 1000 rpm of stirring speed for the
first 4 h. After 4 h, the stirring speed was slowed to 300 rpm and
the reaction was maintained at 90 °C for further 12–16
h. The B4S4 polymer was dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran
(THF) at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. In a separate glass vial,
1-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine (E7) (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved
in 40 mL of THF at 0.2 M final concentration. End-chain capping reaction
was performed by mixing the two solutions and leaving it at room temperature,
under stirring at 400 rpm for 24 h, and protected from light. The
final product is termed 447.

The resulting 447 was purified
by precipitation in anhydrous diethyl ether (1:3 v/v THF/diethyl ether)
and dried under vacuum for 24 h. Polymers were then dissolved in acetate
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C
until use.

2.3 Preparation and Characterization
of PbAE/mRNA
Polyplex
PbAE/mRNA polyplex was prepared by mixing one volume
of the PbAE polymer with one volume of mRNA molecules in acetate buffer
using a PbAE/mRNA (w/w) mass ratio = 30. After a 20 min incubation
at room temperature, the polyplex was analyzed for size distribution
and zeta potential using a Zetasizer NanoZS dynamic light-scattering
instrument (Malvern Instruments). The PbAE/mRNA polyplex was also
analyzed in a gel retardation assay. Briefly, a polyplex sample containing
250 ng of mRNA was loaded into each well and separated by electrophoresis
in a 0.7% agarose gel with 1× Tris–borate–EDTA
buffer (BioRad, Hercules, CA). RNA bands were stained with Gelred
nucleic acid gel stain (Biotium) and visualized with a GelDoc system
(BioRad).

2.4 Preparation and Characterization of the Lipopolyplex
Incorporating α-GalCer
All the lipids were dissolved
in chloroform at a final concentration of 20 mg/mL and used to prepare
thin lipid films by rotary evaporation in a Rotavapor (Buchi) under
partial vacuum. The thin lipid film was rehydrated with a solution
containing PbAE/mRNA polyplex to prepare the lipopolyplex. The lipid
film was composed of 49% EDOPC, 49% DOPE, and 2% DSPE-PEG or 16% MVL5,
82% DOPE, and 2% DSPE-PEG for mono-LP and multi-LP, respectively.
The formulations included 0.5 μg of α-GalCer. Hydrodynamic
size and zeta potential of the lipopolyplexes were measured with a
Zetasizer Nano ZS dynamic light-scattering instrument (Malvern). The
complete construct was also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). The incorporation of α-GalCer was confirmed as previously
reported.29 Briefly, multi-LP/α-GalCer
+ mRNA nanoparticles loaded with different amounts of α-GalCer
(50, 100, 250, and 500 ng) were added to the RPMI-1640 medium with
1 × 105 BMDCs. After 24 h of incubation, the supernatants
were removed, and 1 × 105 DN32.D3 mouse iNKT hybridoma
cells were added and cocultured with bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs).
IL-2 levels were measured by ELISA after 24 h of incubation.

2.5 Preparation of BMDCs
BMDCs were prepared
from C57BL/6 mice as previously described.22,42 Briefly, bone marrow cells from the femur and tibia were flushed
out with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)-containing phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) using a syringe. Cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, treated with ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological)
to remove red blood cells, and resuspended in RPMI-1640 culture medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
20 ng/mL of granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), and 20 ng/mL of interleukin-4 (IL-4). Cells were seeded
into six-well plates at a seeding density of 1 × 106 cells/mL; the growth medium was changed every other day. The nonadherent
DCs were harvested on day 5. BMDCs were stained for CD11b, CD11c,
and MHC-II and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20).

2.6 MTS Test with BMDCs
To test the potential
cytotoxicity from vaccine formulations, BMDCs were seeded in a 96-well
plate at a seeding density of 3 × 104 cells/well and
treated with 0.1 μg of mRNA loaded into mono-LP or multi-LP.
Cell viability was measured 24 h later with a tetrazolium-based Cell
Titer 96Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) assay (Promega)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.7 Transfection of BMDCs
Enhanced GFP-mRNA
was used as a reporter to test the transfection efficiency in BMDCs.
On day 5, 3 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 24-well
plates and treated in complete RPMI-1640 with mono-LP and multi-LP
loaded with 0.5 μg of eGFP-mRNA. The expression of eGFP in cells
was determined with a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) and the
percentage of eGFP-expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry
(BD Fortessa X-20).

2.8 Bioluminescence Imaging
in Live Mice
C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group)
were injected with
multi-LP/LUC-mRNA (20 μg of mRNA) following an intravenous (i.v.)
administration route. After 6 h, the mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 200 μL of d-luciferin (15 mg/mL) (Gold Biotechnology),
and bioluminescence was measured using a PerkinElmer IVIS Spectrum
imaging system. The mice were monitored for body weight every 2 days
for 4 weeks. Luminescence quantification was carried out using LivingImage
software (PerkinElmer).

2.9 In Vivo APC Uptake and
Transfection
C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 in each
group from two pooled
experiments) were intravenously or intradermally (i.d.) injected with
lipopolyplexes loaded with Cy5-eGFP-mRNA (20 μg) for the evaluation
of the cellular uptake and transfection efficiency. After 24 h, mice
were sacrificed and the spleen and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) (inguinal
lymph nodes, ILNs) were harvested and processed into single-cell suspensions.

Single-cell suspensions were obtained as described previously.22 Briefly, spleens or lymph nodes were pressed
through a 70 μM cell strainer with the plunger of a 5 mL syringe.
Erythrocytes were removed by the addition of ACK lysis buffer (Quality
Biological). The cells were stained with anti-B220, anti-CD19, anti-CD11c,
and anti-F4/80 in order to gate DCs (CD11c+ and F4/80–), macrophages (CD11c– and F4/80+), and B-cells (CD11c–, B220+ and CD19+) populations. The samples were analyzed by
flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20). Animal experiments in this study
were carried out in accordance with guidelines evaluated and approved
by the ethics committee of the University of Ottawa to ensure the
humane animal care and use.

2.10 Detection of CD69 in Spleen
and Lymph Nodes
by Flow Cytometry
Mice (C57BL/6, n = 5 in
each group from two pooled experiments) were injected i.d. or i.v.
with multi-LP vaccine loaded with 10 μg of TRP2-mRNA and with
or without 1 μg of α-GalCer. After 24 h, mice were sacrificed,
and lymph nodes (ILNs and axillary lymph nodes) and spleens were harvested
and processed into single-cell suspensions.

Lymphocytes were
stained for V450/viability dye, TCRβ, NK1.1, and CD69 to gate
NK cells (TCRβ– and NK1.1+), NKT
cells (TCRβ+ and NK1.1+), and T cells
(TCRβ+ and NK1.1–). The samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20).

2.11 Measurement
of Proinflammatory Cytokines
C57BL/6 mice (n = 8 for each group from three
pooled experiments) were vaccinated with different vaccine formulations
(multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA, multi-LP/mRNA, multi-LP/α-GalCer,
free α-GalCer + mRNA, and free α-GalCer) loaded with 10
μg of TRP-2 mRNA and/or 0.5 μg of α-GalCer. After
6 h, blood was collected by lateral saphenous bleeding and allowed
to clot overnight at 4 °C; serum was separated by centrifugation
at 12 000 rpm for 15 min, 4 °C. The serum was quickly
frozen at −80 °C and stored until use. Serum TNF-α,
IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12
levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
kits (eBioscience).

2.12 Detection of Antigen-Specific
T Cells by
Intracellular and Tetramer Staining
Mice (C57BL/6, n = 5 in each group from two pooled experiments) were injected
intravenously with different vaccine formulations, such as multi-LP/α-GalCer
+ TRP2-mRNA, multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA, multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA + free α-GalCer,
free α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA, and PBS as a negative control. The
vaccine formulations were prepared using 10 μg of TRP2-mRNA
and 0.5 μg of α-GalCer. Blood was collected from vaccinated
mice by saphenous bleeding and erythrocytes were removed by addition
of ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological). peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with 1 μg/mL of TRP2-peptide (SVYDFFVWL)
for 6 h in the presence of a protein transport inhibitor, Brefeldin
A (BD GolgiPlug). After incubation, cells were washed and stained
with Abs for surface markers-TCRβ, CD8, and V450/viability dye.
Cells were then washed, fixed, and permeabilized with a BD Fixation/Permeabilization
Solution Kit and stained with anti-IFN-γ. The cells were washed,
resuspended in FACS buffer (1× PBS and 0.5% BSA), and analyzed
by flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20).

SVYDFFVWL-specific tetramer
(MBL International) staining was carried out by incubation at room
temperature for 10 min in FACS buffer. After washing, PBMCs were stained
with anti-TCRβ, anti-CD8 clone KT15, and V450/viability for
30 min at 4 °C in FACS buffer. Then, the samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry (BD Fortessa X-20).

2.13 Measurement
of Antibody Titers
OVA-specific
antibody titers were measured in the serum of C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 in each group from two pooled experiments) immunized
on days 0, 7, and 14 by i.v. injection. Blood was collected by saphenous
bleeding on day 28 after priming and allowed to clot overnight at
4 °C. The serum was separated by centrifugation at 10 000
rpm for 20 min. The serum was collected, and anti-OVA antibody titers
were determined by ELISA, as previously described.22 Briefly, 96-well plates (Nunc-Immuno) were coated by overnight
incubation at 4 °C with 2 μg/well of OVA in PBS. Plates
were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h, and serial two-fold dilutions
of serum samples in PBS were added to the wells. After a 2 h incubation,
the plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated
for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin
G (IgG), IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c antibodies (Southern Biotechnology
Associates). The plates were incubated with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
substrate and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 N HCl
(Sigma). Absorbance was read at 450 nm with a microplate reader (BioRad).
Antibody titers were calculated as the inverse dilution at which the
absorbance equaled that of control mice plus 2 standard deviations.

2.14 Therapeutic Efficacy Using a Subcutaneous
B16-F10 Tumor Model
C57BL/6 mice (n = 5
in each group) were inoculated with 2 × 105 B16-F10
melanoma tumor cells by subcutaneous injection to establish subcutaneous
tumors, following a previously described protocol.43 Five days after tumor inoculation, mice were intravenously
vaccinated with different formulations (10 μg of unmodified
TRP2-mRNA with or without 0.5 μg of α-GalCer) and boosted
at days 9 and 13 post-tumor inoculation. B16-F10 tumor bearing mice
were monitored for survival, body weight, and tumor growth every 2
days. Tumor volume was calculated using the following formula: V = (L × W × W)/2, where V is the tumor volume, L is the tumor length, and W is the tumor
width.

2.15 Evaluation of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes
and Tetramer-Positive CD8+ T Cells in s.c. B16-F10 Tumors
C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 in each group from two pooled
experiments) were inoculated subcutaneously with 2 × 105 B16-F10 melanoma tumor cells. Eight days after tumor inoculation,
mice were intravenously vaccinated with different formulations (10
μg of TRP2-mRNA with or without 0.5 μg of α-GalCer)
and boosted 15 days post-tumor inoculation. Mice were sacrificed 17
days post-tumor inoculation and the tumors were harvested for tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) quantification.

Tumor cell suspensions
were prepared from solid tumors by mechanical disaggregation as described
previously.44 Erythrocytes were removed
by the addition of ACK lysis buffer (Quality Biological). The resulting
suspension was passed through a 40 μm cell strainer, washed
once with PBS, and resuspended in FACS buffer for flow cytometry analysis.
For TIL evaluation, cells were stained with a viability dye, anti-CD45,
anti-TCRβ, anti-CD8, and anti-CD4 and analyzed by flow cytometry
(BD Fortessa X-20). SVYDFFVWL-specific tetramer (MBL International)
staining was carried out by incubation at room temperature for 10
min in FACS buffer, followed by surface staining with anti-CD45, anti-TCRβ,
anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 clone KT15 for 30 min at 4 °C in FACS
buffer.

2.16 Statistical Analysis
One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) post hoc tests were used to determine the significance
of differences between experimental and relevant control values within
each experiment. All analyses were performed using the Graph Pad Prism
8.0 statistical software. Significant differences were reported as
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
***p < 0.001. Survival curves were plotted for
each condition and the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used
to evaluate statistical significance on GraphPad Prism 8.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Multi-LP Delivery System
Development
We designed a novel platform for mRNA-based vaccine
that consisted
of a PbAE/mRNA polyplex core structure coated by a lipid bilayer shell
(Figure 1a). Two different
formulations were prepared using a monovalent cationic lipid (EDOPC)
or a multivalent cationic lipid (MLV5) to obtain a mono-LP or a multi-LP
vector, respectively. This study was aimed to assess the effect of
the surface charge density on important properties of hybrid lipid-/polymer-based
vaccine, such as transfection efficiency in DCs, toxicity profile,
biodistribution, and immunological and therapeutic activities.

(BMDC/iNKT ratio 1:1) for 24 h in the presence of different amounts
of vectorized α-GalCer (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 μg/mL)
and fix amount of mRNA (0.5 μg/mL). The production of IL-2 was
measured by ELISA. Data are mean ± S.D. of three independent
experiments.

Agarose gel retardation assay
was performed to assess the mRNA-binding
capacity of the cationic PbAE polymer. The gel retardation assay revealed
complete mRNA incorporation into the polyplex core at the PbAE/mRNA
ratio of 10–40 (Figure 1b). The multi-LP loaded with α-GalCer/mRNA was characterized
for physical properties, such as size and zeta potential (Figure 1c,d, respectively),
exhibiting a hydrodynamic diameter of 132.3 ± 3.78 nm, as confirmed
by TEM analysis (Figure 1e), and a strongly positive zeta potential of +33.6 mV because of
the cationic lipid included in the external layer, whereas the polyplex
core alone, prepared using a PbAE/mRNA (w/w) ratio of 20, showed a
hydrodynamic size of 113 ± 3.16 nm and a zeta potential of +35.8
mV. The lipopolyplex vector prepared using a monovalent cationic lipid
resulted in a nanoparticle with a size of 150.9 ± 3.62 nm and
a zeta potential of +38 mV.

Size and charge are essential parameters
for efficient passive
targeting of APCs. For instance, nanoparticles with a size range from
∼25 to 200 nm have been proven to traffic to the dLN where
they are rapidly taken up by APCs and can, therefore, be used to elicit
different immunological outcomes.45 Furthermore,
it is well known that positively charged nanoparticles exhibit a faster
uptake rate by phagocytic cells than negatively charged or neutral
nanoparticles, and up to date, they have been revealed as the most
effective carriers for gene delivery.46

The encapsulation of α-GalCer into multi-LP nanoparticles
was confirmed indirectly through the quantification of IL-2 levels
released by DN32.D3 iNKT hybridoma cells cocultured with BMDCs pretreated
with multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA loaded with different amounts
of α-GalCer (Figure 1f).

In line with the above, we designed a delivery platform
with optimized
physical–chemical properties for passive DC targeting and for
the delivery of macromolecules, such as antigen-encoding mRNAs.

3.2 Multi-LP Is an Optimal Platform for mRNA-Based
Transfection
The multi-LP and mono-LP platforms were prepared
using two different lipid formulations, MVL5/DOPE/DSPE-PEG (16:82:2)
and EDOPC/DOPE/DSPE-PEG (49:49:2), respectively. To compare the transfection
efficiency of the two formulations, mono-LP and multi-LP were loaded
with an mRNA encoding for eGFP and the expression of the gene reporter
was quantified by flow cytometry (Figure 2a) and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 2b). Quantification
of the transfection efficiency was carried out at 24 and 48 h post-transfection
and peak expression was observed at 48 h. Multi-LP loaded with eGFP-mRNA
was highly efficient to transfect BMDCs in vitro, with an efficiency
of ∼50% (Figure 2a), whereas mono-LP showed a lower transfection efficiency; naked
mRNA failed to transfect BMDCs. These data demonstrate that the incorporation
of the multivalent cationic lipid (MLV5) significantly increased the
in vitro transfection efficiency of mRNA-loaded lipopolyplex platforms.
It is known that efficient gene delivery requires a large molar charge
ratio (cationic lipid/nucleic acid), which often results in the use
of a relatively high amount of cationic lipid per cell, with a consequent
increase in toxicity. In this context, the use of MVLs can improve
the safety profile of the formulation compared to monovalent lipids
because a smaller number of MVLs are required to achieve superior
transfection efficiency compared to monovalent DOTAP and with significantly
less toxicity.47−49

BMDCs were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/mL
in a 24-well plate and transfected with 0.5 μg of eGFP-mRNA
naked (mRNA) or encapsulated into mono-LP and multi-LP. Error bars

expression of maturation surface markers (CD40, CD80, and CD86) in
BMDCs treated with multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA nanoparticles.

Importantly, cytotoxicity evaluations performed
employing MTS assay
indicated that the multi-LP formulation was completely nontoxic in
BMDCs (Figure 2c).
Thus, we provide evidence that these nanoparticles are biocompatible
and can be effectively used for mRNA delivery. Finally, we tested
multi-LP nanoparticles loaded with mRNA encoding for LUC reporter
in vivo because transfection systems that work efficiently in vitro
often fail to function or have serious toxicity in vivo. Six hours
after administration, a significant bioluminescence signal was detected
in the abdominal region, demonstrating successful transfection by
mRNA-loaded multi-LP particles (Figure 2d). Ex vivo bioluminescence of organs revealed that
LUC expression was mostly localized in the liver, spleen, inguinal
lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) (Figure 2e). Our data are in line with previous studies,
which have found that nanoparticles with a size larger than 50 nm
rapidly accumulated in the liver and spleen upon i.v. administration.50 Conventionally, liver accumulation of drug-loaded
nanoparticles is strongly unwanted, and it is unanimously recognized
as the major barrier to clinical translation of nanomaterials. However,
in this study, liver accumulation could be desirable, given that our
strategy involves the delivery of two distinct immune agents, α-GalCer
and an mRNA coding for a selected tumor antigen, that are recognized
by iNKT (most abundant in the liver) and T cells (most abundant in
lymphoid organs), respectively.51 Bioluminescence
distribution revealed efficient dual targeting of the liver and lymphoid
organs (mostly spleen, ILNs, and MLNs) and excluded any undesired
off-target signal.

Moreover, multi-LP nanoparticles did not
elicit signs of toxicity
in mice. No changes in the body mass or behavior of mice were detected
for up to 4 weeks following a relatively high administration dose
(Figure 2f).

The expression of DC maturation markers was quantified in BMDCs
after treatment with multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA and compared with
the control that was treated with the empty vector. The post-treatment
DCs had a significantly increased level of CD40, CD80, and CD86 on
their surface (Figure 2g). These data confirm that our nanovaccine is not only able to provide
a source of a protein antigen, as demonstrated by eGFP expression
after multi-LP/eGFP-mRNA treatment, but also to efficiently induce
the expression of important costimulatory molecules that are necessary
for efficient antigen presentation to lymphocytes.

3.3 Passive DC Targeting in Vivo for mRNA Delivery
APCs
are responsible for driving the induction of CD8+ T-cell-mediated
immune responses. Therefore, it was of particular
interest to analyze the ability of the multi-LP vaccine to target
the different APC subsets, such as DCs, macrophages, and B cells.
For this study, mice were immunized once i.d. or i.v. with mono-LP
and multi-LP nanoparticles loaded with fluorescently labeled mRNA
(Cy5-eGFP-mRNA). Twenty four hours after vaccination, single-cell
suspensions obtained from spleens and dLNs were stained with an antibody
panel directed against common APC markers: DCs (CD11c+ and
F4/80–), macrophages (CD11c– and
F4/80+), and B cells (CD11c–, B220+ and CD19+).

At 24 h after i.v. administration,
multi-LP nanoparticles were taken up predominately by DCs, while a
lower uptake was also observed for B cells and macrophages (Figure 3a,b). In contrast,
Cy5-eGFP-mRNA-loaded multi-LP failed to target APCs and efficiently
release the mRNA into their cytoplasm after i.d. injection (Figure 3a,b).

Values represent the mean ± SD of two separate experiments involving
three to five mice per group. Values were considered significant at
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n.s. = not significant. Statistical significance
was evaluated using a nonparametric one-way ANOVA with a Dunn’s
post-test.

On the other hand, the uptake
of mono-LP nanoparticles by the different
APC populations in both spleen and dLNs was significantly lower than
that from multi-LP (Figure 3c,d). Surprisingly, the vector showed a certain preference
for the i.v. administration route, in terms of its ability to target
APC populations. The in vivo transfection efficiency study also confirmed
that the expression of eGFP was predominantly observed in DCs both
in spleen and dLNs following i.v. vaccination with multi-LP, whereas
a minor fraction of eGFP-positive B cells and macrophages were detected
in the spleen (Figure 3e,f). Oppositely, we could not detect any transfected DCs, B-cells,
and macrophages upon i.d. injection of multi-LP/eGFP-mRNA (data not
shown). In accordance with these results, we can affirm that the multi-LP
vector has a superior capability to target passively APCs in lymphoid
organs, compared to mono-LP, showing a preferential uptake by DCs
after systemic administration.

3.4 Comparison
of i.d. and i.v. Routes for the
Capacity To Promote Immune Cell Activation
It has been demonstrated
that the simultaneous activation of various immune pathways, by combining
α-GalCer with TLRs adjuvants, can synergistically enhance the
effectiveness and duration of antitumor immune responses; therefore,
in the present study, we hypothesized that the combination of the
lipid antigen α-GalCer and self-adjuvanted mRNA may potentially
enhance their immunological properties.52−54 For this reason, naïve
mice were injected either i.v. or i.d. with multi-LP nanoparticles
loaded with antigen-mRNA with or without α-GalCer. At 24 h post-immunization,
single-cell suspensions obtained from spleens and dLNs were analyzed
by flow cytometry in order to measure the upregulation of the lymphocyte
activation marker CD69 on NKT, NK, and T cells.

TRP2 was identified
as a candidate antigen given that it is commonly overexpressed in
mouse and human melanocytes, and it currently represents one of the
major and better-characterized melanoma antigens.55,56 Immunization with multi-LP loaded with α-GalCer/TRP2-mRNA
resulted in a significantly stronger activation of NKT, NK, and T
cells in both spleen and dLNs (data not shown), suggesting that α-GalCer
and antigen-mRNA together may potentiate the immune response particularly
after i.v. administration, thus confirming that our formulation is
well suited for systemic delivery (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Flow cytometry analysis of CD69 in spleen NKT,
NK, and T cells
from mice treated with multi-LP loaded with TRP2-mRNA and with or
without α-GalCer administrated i.d. or i.v. Values represent
the mean ± SD of two separate experiments involving two to three
mice per group. Values were considered significant at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n.s. = not significant. Statistical significance was
evaluated using a nonparametric one-way ANOVA with a Dunn’s
post-test.

Likewise, at 6 h after i.v. vaccination
with multi-LP loaded with
α-GalCer and TRP2-mRNA, we observed a high induction of cytokine
secretion. Particularly, the formulation stimulated the release of
high levels of type-I interferon (IFN), IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ
(Figure 5). Although
multi-LP/mRNA alone induced the release of IL-12, the addition of
α-GalCer to the vaccine formulation resulted in significantly
higher levels of IL-12 secretion. Notably, the induction of IFN-γ
was only attributable to the treatment with α-GalCer. In fact,
multi-LP vector loaded with TRP2-mRNA alone did not induce a significant
release of IFN-γ while both α-GalCer/TRP2-mRNA- and α-GalCer-loaded
multi-LP nanoparticles induced a comparable level of IFN-γ without
a significant difference. Although the levels of type-I IFNs were
higher in the group receiving multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA compared
to the group vaccinated with multi-LP/mRNA, the difference was not
statistically significant. High levels of type-I IFNs are clinically
relevant, as previous studies have shown that type-I IFNs directly
activate immune cells, including DCs, CD4+ T cells, and
CD8+ T cells, and are required for efficient cross-priming
of CD8+ T cells.57 Importantly,
the nonvectorized formulation did not induce detectable levels of
type-I IFNs, thus confirming the importance of mRNA encapsulation
for immune activation.58,59 The introduction of α-GalCer
in the vaccine formulation ensures the stimulation or enhancement
of the release of key cytokines that nonadjuvanted mRNA vaccine lacks.

Values were considered significant at *p < 0.05,

3.5 Antigen-Specific T-Cell
Response
To evaluate the impact of our vaccine formulation
on the induction
of cellular and humoral immunity, mice were intravenously immunized
with multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA, multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA, multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA
+ free α-GalCer, and multi-LP/α-GalCer on days 0 and 7.
Ten days after the last immunization, the presence of TRP2-specific
CD8+ T cells was evaluated by intracellular staining for
IFN-γ- and TRP2-specific tetramer staining.

The number
of TRP2(180–188)-specific IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells was significantly higher in mice immunized with the vectorized
vaccine formulation compared to the group immunized with multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA
+ free α-GalCer (Figure 6a).

Figure 6 (a) Quantification of CD8+ T cells expressing IFN-γ
in peripheral blood. (b) Quantification of SVYDFFVWL+ CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated
two times with TRP-2-mRNA with a 1-week interval by i.v. administration.
All the formulations were prepared with 10 μg of TRP-2-mRNA
with or without 0.5 μg of α-GalCer. Values represent the
mean ± SD of two separate experiments involving two to three
mice per group. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Antibody titers of
OVA-specific total IgG, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c (c), and IgG2c/IgG1
ratio (d) 4 weeks after prime immunization. Values represent the mean
± SD of two separate experiments involving two to three mice
per group. Values were considered significant at *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, n.s. = not significant. Statistical significance was
evaluated using a nonparametric one-way ANOVA with a Dunn’s
post-test.

In addition, the percentage of
TRP2-specific IFN-γ-secreting
CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in the mice immunized
with multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA compared with those immunized
with multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA and multi-LP/α-GalCer, demonstrating
that by combining α-GalCer with antigen-mRNA, it is possible
to achieve a stronger antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell immune
response (Figure 6a).
We also performed tetramer staining which confirmed the same trend
obtained by intracellular IFN-γ staining (Figure 6b). In particular, the frequency of TRP2
(180–188) tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells was significantly
increased in mice treated with vectorized vaccine formulation including
both α-GalCer and TRP2-mRNA (Figure 6b).

The induction of humoral immune
responses was also evaluated in
response to vaccination (Figure 6c,d). For this purpose, C57BL/6 mice were immunized
with multi-LP vector loaded with 10 μg of OVA-encoding mRNA
(OVA-mRNA) and/or α-GalCer (0.5 μg). The serum was collected
at 4 weeks after the prime immunization from the vaccinated mice,
and levels of total IgG, IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG2c antibodies were determined
by ELISA (Figure 6c).
The results of IgG subclass analysis show that treatment with multi-LP/α-GalCer
+ OVA-mRNA leads to the production of antibodies with a higher IgG2c/IgG1
ratio, compared with the other formulations that have been tested
such as multi-LP/OVA-mRNA, multi-LP/α-GalCer, and multi-LP/OVA-mRNA
+ Free α-GalCer (Figure 6d).

Vaccination with multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA
enhanced IgG1 and
IgG2c antibody titers ∼1700- and ∼4000-fold, respectively,
over multi-LP/mRNA, multi-LP/α-GalCer, and multi-LP/mRNA + free
α-GalCer (Figure 6c). In contrast to other vaccine formulations, the immunization with
multi-LP/mRNA failed to further enhance the secretion of IgG2b antibodies.25 Probably, the difference in IgG isotypes could
be in part attributed to the different structural characteristics
between the delivery platforms employed in this study and in previous
works.60,61

3.6 Therapeutic Efficacy of
Vectorized α-GalCer/TRP2-mRNA
Vaccine in a B16-F10 Melanoma Tumor Model
Once we confirmed
that the addition of α-GalCer into the mRNA-vaccine elicited
a robust antigen-specific immune response, we wanted to investigate
if this could translate into increased therapeutic efficacy compared
to the nonadjuvanted mRNA-vaccine, in a relevant tumor model. To test
this, B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice were i.v. vaccinated using unmodified
TRP2-mRNA at days 5, 9, and 13 post-tumor inoculation and the therapeutic
efficacy of the combined treatments was evaluated in terms of tumor
growth inhibition and survival. As shown in Figure 7a, treatment with multi-LP/mRNA and multi-LP/α-GalCer
alone exhibited a modest inhibitory effect on tumor growth, while
multi-LP loaded with an irrelevant mRNA (irrel. mRNA) (OVA-mRNA) had
no effect, excluding any nonspecific immune response. On the other
hand, mice immunized with multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA exhibited
a significant delay in tumor growth, demonstrating that although mRNA
possesses self-adjuvant property, the addition of vaccine adjuvants
can significantly potentiate its therapeutic efficacy.

Figure 7 C57BL/6 mice were inoculated
with 2 × 105 B16-F10
cells. The mice were immunized with three vaccinations at days 5,
9, and 13 post-tumor inoculation. The mice were evaluated for tumor
size (a) and survival (b). Representative gross tumor size excised
from PBS, multi-LP/mRNA, multi-LP/Irrel. mRNA, multi-LP/α-GalCer,
and multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA-treated mice sacrificed 18 days
post-tumor inoculation. Data represent the mean ± SD of three
separate experiments involving five mice per group. Differences in
tumor size were considered significant at *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
n.s. = not significant (one-way ANOVA with post-Turkey test). For
the survival curves, the significance of the difference with the control
was evaluated by log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Mice were treated
by i.v. administration of two doses on days 8 and 15 post-tumor inoculation.
Mice were sacrificed on day 17 and tumor-infiltrating CD8 and CD4
T cells were quantified by flow cytometry (c). (d) Quantification
of intra-tumoral SVYDFFVWL+ CD8+ T cells after
vaccination with different formulations. Data represent the mean ±
SD of two independent experiments involving two to three mice per
group. Values were considered significant at *p <
0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001,
n.s. = not significant. Statistical significance was evaluated using
a nonparametric one-way ANOVA with a Dunn’s post-test.

Moreover, mice vaccinated with TRP2-mRNA/α-GalCer-loaded
multi-LP nanoparticles (multi-LP/α-GalCer + mRNA) showed a significantly
extended survival if compared with those treated with TRP2-mRNA-loaded
multi-LP nanoparticles (multi-LP/mRNA), multi-LP/α-GalCer, or
multi-LP/irrel. mRNA (Figure 7b). These findings clearly demonstrate that the codelivery
of antigen-mRNA with α-GalCer by multi-LP vector robustly improves
the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer mRNA-vaccines.

Consistent
with the efficacy studies, we found that multi-LP/α-GalCer
+ TRP2-mRNA vaccination promotes increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells within the tumor microenvironment (Figure 7c). The combined treatment
increased the CTL density and CD8/CD4 ratio (Figure 7c). Furthermore, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell analysis revealed a higher frequency of TRP2-positive
tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumor-bearing mice vaccinated
with multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA compared with multi-LP/TRP2-mRNA,
multi-LP/α-GalCer, or multi-LP/Irrel. mRNA (Figure 7d).

4 Conclusions
The incorporation of α-GalCer into the lipopolyplex vector
loaded with TRP2-mRNA potentiated the antitumor immune response and
its therapeutic efficacy. Our results revealed that the proposed vector
for the delivery of antigen-mRNA in combination with α-GalCer
possesses a natural ability to passively target DCs in vivo and to
efficiently transfect them, following the i.v. administration route.
Our results also showed that the use of multi-LP vector for α-GalCer/TRP2-mRNA
codelivery significantly enhanced the induction of antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells both systemically and intratumorally. Likewise,
multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA vaccination has shown to be an
efficient strategy for the induction of humoral immune responses in
vivo, eliciting the secretion of high levels of antigen-specific IgG1,
IgG2b, and IgG2c. Mice vaccinated with multi-LP/α-GalCer + TRP2-mRNA
showed a significantly higher IgG2c/IgG1 ratio compared to mice immunized
with nanoparticles loaded only with antigen-mRNA, demonstrating that
by combining mRNA-based vaccine with α-GalCer, it is possible
to alter the Th1/Th2 balance toward an increased Th1 response.

All this resulted in marked tumor growth retardation and increased
survival of B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice. We were able to achieve
the induction of an effective antitumor immune response with a lower
amount of mRNA, compared to other proposed vaccination strategies
based on the use of lipoplexes.21

These data may have important implications in the design of novel
formulations combining mRNA with lipidic adjuvants for the development
of cancer vaccines with enhanced antitumor properties.
