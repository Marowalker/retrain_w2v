Cellulose
microfibrils (CMFs) are an important nanoscale building
block in many novel biobased functional materials. The spatial nano-
and microscale organization of the CMFs is a crucial factor for defining
the properties of these materials. Here, we report for the first time
a direct three-dimensional (3D) real-space analysis of individual
CMFs and their networks formed after ultrahigh-shear-induced transient
deagglomeration and self-assembly in a solvent. Using point-scanning
confocal microscopy combined with tracking the centerlines of the
fibrils and their junctions by a stretching open active contours method,
we reveal that dispersions of the native CMFs assemble into highly
heterogeneous networks of individual fibrils and bundles. The average
network mesh size decreases with increasing CMF volume fraction. The
cross-sectional width and the average length between the twists in
the ribbon-shaped CMFs are directly determined and compared well with
that of fibrils in the dried state. Finally, the generality of the
fluorescent labeling and imaging approach on other CMF sources is
illustrated. The unique ability to quantify in situ the multiscale
structure in CMF dispersions provides a powerful tool for the correlation
of process–structure–property relationship in cellulose-containing
composites and dispersions.

Introduction
Filamentous biopolymer-based
networks are ubiquitous in nature
and play a crucial role in maintaining the structural integrity of
living systems. Cellulose forms an important class of fibrillar biopolymer
systems owing to its specific molecular structure and defined hierarchical
order that lead to many interesting properties.1 The cellulose-based nanoscale materials derived from cellulose
microfibrils (CMFs), also referred to as nanofibrils (Figure S1),2 are of
great interest for several applications owing to their shape anisotropy,
high strength, and chirality.3−6 Recently, there has been a strong interest in the
three-dimensional (3D) CMF networks driven by their potential use
in many advanced biobased materials such as a transparent paper,7 a conductive paper,8 functional aerogels,9−12 implants and scaffolds in tissue engineering,13 and high-strength structural composites.14 The nature of assembly and organization of CMFs in dispersions
often prepared by high-shear defibrillation or deagglomeration using
ultrahigh-pressure homogenization or microfluidization process holds
the key to attain the desired properties of the composite materials
derived from them.15,16 Such high-energy processes allow
transient deagglomeration followed by the self-assembly of the CMF,
which can be modulated by controlling their interparticle interactions.17 Methods for studying CMF dispersion in their
native, nondried form are much needed to understand the nano- and
microscale organization in these materials.

The morphology of
CMF from different sources has been studied using
high-resolution imaging techniques such as transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).18−20 A fundamental
limitation of studying CMF dispersions using TEM and AFM is that these
methods are more relevant for understanding the properties of the
fibrils in their dry state. These methods can be prone to the generation
of artifacts resulting from the sample preparation processes.18 Kaushik et al. had used cryo-TEM to study the
nanocrystallites of cellulose in their suspension form, and it revealed
marked differences with the dried forms.4 The structure and properties of 3D networks of the self-assembled
CMFs in dispersions, however, could markedly differ between those
that were never-dried and those that have been in a dried state.21 Also, most of the applications of CMFs involve
their processing in a never-dried hydrated state or in various solvents,
and hence, it is of great interest to study the 3D nano- and microstructures
of these CMFs in their “wet” state. Previous reports
on imaging cellulose in the native “wet” state include
comparing direct visualization of CMFs in plant cell walls using confocal
microscopy along with image deconvolution with total internal reflection
microscopy and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.22 However, the contrast of fibrils in their images
was poor, probably because of the limited noncovalent attachment of
the dye to cellulose. Fluorescent labeling of the native CMFs has
been demonstrated previously by Helbert et al. on bacterial cellulose
(BC) that has been homogenized by a low-energy blender, which does
not create conditions for the transient deagglomeration of the microfibrils.23 Zammarano et al. have used a similar labeling
approach to reveal the interface in cellulose–polymer composites.24 The functional properties of the composite materials
are governed by both the nano- and microscale spatial and orientational
organizations of the reinforcing fibrils, which are in turn influenced
by the processing conditions.16 Considering
the rapid developments in the utilization of CMFs in various nanostructured
composite materials, it is important to perform a 3D real-space analysis
of their assembled structure, which is often a precursor for the final
material,9−12,25,26 to reveal and quantify the mesoscale organization.

Results and Discussion
In this study, CMFs from different sources were fluorescently labeled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to visualize and observe their
microstructure using confocal microscopy. FITC reacts with hydroxyl
groups along the surface of CMFs, leading to covalent attachment.
Imaging contrast was improved by having a dye grafted to the fibril
surface compared with that of a physically adsorbing dye that can
partially remain in the solvent (Figure S2). The CMFs sourced from bacteria are a pure form of cellulose, free
from lignin and hemicellulose;27 hence,
they serve as a good model system to investigate the properties of
3D networks of the self-assembled CMFs. The refractive index (RI)
mismatch between the sample medium and the objects in it and the imaging
objective leads to deterioration of the point spread function (PSF),
which becomes more pronounced with increasing the depth of focus into
the sample volume in the case of 3D imaging.28 This effect was reduced by dispersing the CMF in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) where the RI difference is lesser than that in water. Scattering
within the sample is lowered considerably, leading to further improvement
in the imaging quality. During imaging, no change in the network structure
of the CMFs was detected as their motion was topologically constrained
in the range of concentrations analyzed. The network structures of
samples below 0.05% volume fraction (ϕ) obtained by simple dilution
(i.e., without high shear) could not be imaged as the ends of some
fibrils started to dangle owing to the loss of topological constraints
(see Movie M1). Figure 1a shows a deconvoluted 3D image of the BC
pellicle (i.e., the 3D network of CMF before high-shear deagglomeration)
imaged with confocal microscopy. Deconvolution using a theoretical
PSF was done to improve the images. The fine network structure of
individual CMFs inherent in these pellicles can be seen clearly. We
could estimate the width of fibrils from the intensity profile along
its cross-section (Figure 1). By applying a Gaussian fit (Figure 1b) to the intensity profile along a fibril
cross-section, we obtained a full-width at half maximum of 140 nm,
which is within the range of fibril widths determined by using electron
microscope from our studies (Figure S1)
and as reported by others.29,30

When subjected to very
high shear homogenization by microfluidization,
the CMFs experience transient deagglomeration, which allow the fibrils
to self-assemble in a different way. This self-assembly process can
be strongly influenced by the presence of an adsorbing polymer that
controls interparticle interactions.17 The
CMF dispersed in DMSO was imaged at different volume fractions (made
by concentrating a 0.11% ϕ stock dispersion), as shown in Figure 2. One can see that
at higher volume fractions the networks appear denser and bundling
of fibrils is more evident. The microstructure is heterogeneous with
the presence of both individual and bundles of fibrils. Voids are
present. Using a stretching open active contours (SOAC) algorithm,31 the centerlines of the fibrils were traced,
and the network was reconstructed to obtain their coordinates in 3D
along with that of the fibril contacts (junctions). Closely packed
fibrils that appear as one thick bundle are traced as single fibrils
owing to the lack of sufficient resolution parting one fibril from
another.

networks at different volume fractions [left to right: 0.11% (30.22

9.49 μm3) ϕ] and their respective 3D reconstruction
images (purple = fibrils, green = fibril junctions). Scale bar: 10
μm.

Owing to the heterogeneous nature
of the network microstructure,
the fibril length between the subsequent junctions, which directly
relates to the mesh size, ξ, of the network,32 has a broad distribution range as shown in Figure 3a for different volume fractions. Figure 3b shows the plot
of the average mesh size per unit volume. It is interesting to note
that some of these values lie in the same range irrespective of the
CMF volume fraction.

Figure 3 (a) Distribution of the mesh size of CMF networks at different
volume fractions. (b) Average mesh size per unit volume with respect
to the volume fraction of the CMF network.

It is established generally that the mesh size of densely
connected
filamentous polymer networks follows a power-law relationship with
concentration with an exponent of −0.5; ξ ≈ ϕ–0.5.32 However, the behavior
of CMF networks differs as the network is formed from the components
that exert strong attractions on each other, which breaks down to
flocs (not to individual fibrils) upon dilution or moderate shear.33 We do observe that the average mesh size decreases
with increasing volume fraction as ξ ≈ ϕ–0.32. The smaller exponent is the result accounted by the presence of
voids in the network, which decreases both in size and in number concentration
with increasing volume fractions of CMFs.

The amount of shear
applied plays a definite role in governing
the microstructure of the network formed in the case of CMFs.34 The samples were prepared by concentrating 0.11%
ϕ stock dispersions. Therefore, the microstructure formed by
0.11% sample would be inherited to the rest of the samples. This is
clearly reflected in the mesh size distributions of 0.11, 0.13, and
0.18% ϕ samples, which fall in the same range. The measured
fibril count could be higher as some bundles get classified as single
fibrils in the image reconstruction process. It is also to be noted
that the image reconstruction process is not artifact-free; the results
represent a quantitative analysis of the CMF network microstructure
(Figure S3).

An interesting observation
that can be made from these images is
the appearance of alternating bright and dark segments along the length
of the fibrils, as shown in Figure 4a. This corresponds to the twists inherent in these
ribbon-shaped fibrils. The variation in intensity along a part of
a fibril contour is shown in Figure 4b for a fibril marked in Figure 4a. The darker segments along the fibril contour,
which correspond to valleys (or minima) in the intensity profile,
represent twists. From the 3D intensity profile, the distances between
the subsequent minima reveal the fibril length between the twists
(Lt). Figure 4c shows the distribution ranging from 0.3
to 2 μm, with an average value of 0.73 μm from analyzing
about 80 fibrils of varying widths. This value is slightly smaller
than the one obtained by analyzing the TEM images (see Figure S4) of the CMF dried from the aqueous
media, from which we determined an average length of 0.85 μm
per twist. The reason for this difference might be due to gradual
and natural twisting of CMFs in the dispersed state compared to the
sharp and segmented twists in the dried fibrils, as proposed by Hanley
et al.19

3D confocal image (7.62 ×
7.62 × 7.68 μm3), showing alternating bright
and dark segments along the fibril contours (scale bar: 2 μm).
(b) Intensity profile of a representative fibril. (c) Distribution
of fibril lengths between the twists analyzed from a 3D confocal image.

It is evident from our confocal
images that the CMFs are twisted
gradually, unlike in the TEM images of the fibrils in the dried state.
Our Lt analysis results are also consistent
with the ones reported by Colvin, which were found to be about 0.7
to 1 μm for single dry fibrils based on the TEM observations.35 He also reported a significant variation in
the pitch of the twists even within a single pair of CMFs. However,
we are unable to comment on the uniformity of the interval of occurrence
of twists as we have taken into account the fibrils of varying widths
ranging from single fibrils to bundles in our analysis. The mechanism
behind the twisting of cellulose is still debated.36

To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we
fluorescently
labeled CMF dispersions obtained from the plant biomass materials.
Sugarcane fiber and citrus fiber, which are by-products from the production
of sugar and pectin, respectively, were selected as examples (Figure 5). These two sources
contain not only cellulose but also soluble polymers such as pectin
and hemicellulose, which are typically present in the primary cell
walls of the plant.27 A comparison of the
microstructures of these two sources of CMFs dispersed in water is
shown in Figure 5.
The citrus fiber dispersion, which contains a higher level of soluble
biopolymers, shows a more homogeneous CMF network. The diffusive background
could originate from some degree of covalent attachment of the FITC
molecules to the soluble polymers like pectin. The observed more homogeneous
CMF networks are similar to the case of CMFs in the presence of adsorbing
charge polymers (e.g., CMC17). The CMF
networks derived from the sugarcane appear to behave more like dispersion
of pure CMFs, which is in line with the very higher content of cellulose
(as indicated by the supplier).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate
the first direct 3D visualization
and quantitative analysis of individual CMFs, bundles, and their networks
in dispersion. We obtained the mesh size distribution of the networks
at different volume fractions. Twists inherent in the microfibrils
were clearly identified from the confocal images. The average length
between the twists was found to be slightly greater in the “wet”
state when compared to that in the dried fibrils. The ability to perform
a quantitative 3D real-space analysis will greatly advance the understanding
of structure–mechanics relations in nanoscale fibrillar networks.37 Future work in this direction will focus on
studying the effects of shear on the network structure of CMFs (see Figure S5).

Experimental Section
Materials
Sugarcane fibers (UltraCel, WT-11989) were
obtained from Watson Inc. Citrus fibers (HERBACEL-AQ Plus, type N)
were obtained from Herbafood. The BC microfibrils in the form of pellicles
of the strain Acetobacter were sourced
from a commercial Nata de coco product (Cozzo Food Industries, Malaysia).

Sample Preparation
Syrup from the product was discarded,
and the BC pellicles were immersed in a bath of 0.1 M NaOH solution
and then washed thoroughly with deionized (DI) water (Millipore Direct-Q3).
The washed pellicles were immersed in DI water and broken down using
a hand blender (Braun 4185545). The resulting BC slurry was then subjected
to eight washing cycles involving vacuum filtration and redispersion
in DI water, to remove soluble impurities. After this, it was passed
through a shearing device called Microfluidizer M-110S (Microfluidics
Corp) operating at a pressure of 1200 bar to obtain a macroscopically
homogeneous dispersion. The volume fraction (ϕ) of BC in the
dispersion was determined gravimetrically as the average of three
samples from which water was evaporated at 40 °C under a pressure
of 40 mbar in a vacuum oven (Memmert Celcius), using the density value
of CMFs as 1.5 g/mL.38

CMFs were
fluorescently labeled with FITC by adopting the mechanism reported
by Nielsen et al.39 for charged cellulose
nanocrystals. In a typical reaction, 100 mg of FITC (≥90%,
Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 5 mL of 0.1 M NaOH solution was added
to 250 mL of 0.5 wt % CMF dispersed in 0.1 M NaOH. This mixture was
kept under constant stirring using a magnetic stirrer and allowed
to react for 4 days under no exposure to visible light. After the
reaction, the labeled CMF dispersions were purified by washing with
0.1 M NaOH and then with DI water by repeated centrifugation (Hettich
ROTANTA 460R) at 3566 relative centrifugal field (RCF) for 20 min
followed by redispersion in DI water until the dispersion was colorless
and showed no background fluorescence when observed under a fluorescence
microscope. The CMF dispersions in DMSO (≥99.9% ACS reagent, nD 1.479, Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared by gradual
solvent exchange facilitated by repeated centrifugation, decantation,
and addition of DMSO, thus avoiding drying of the fibrils. The RI
of the supernatant was measured using an Abbe refractometer (ATAGO
NAR 3T) as nD 1.4772 at 20 °C in
the final dispersion, which corresponds to 99% DMSO content. The CMF
dispersion in DMSO was then run once through a Microfluidizer operating
at 1200 bar in order for the network microstructure to re-evolve in
DMSO. From the stock dispersion, samples at different weight % were
prepared by either dilution (by solvent addition followed by mixing
using a universal small shaker at 2500 rpm) with DMSO or concentration
(by centrifugation at 3566 RCF for 20 min). The CMFs from other sources
like citrus fiber (30–50 wt % cellulose) and sugarcane fiber
(90 wt % cellulose) were labeled with FITC following the same procedure.
They were imaged in water.

Confocal Microscopy and Image Analysis
For confocal
imaging, the FITC-labeled CMF dispersions were transferred slowly
into an imaging cell of 5 mm diameter with a depth of 3 mm to avoid
shearing the fibrils. A Leica SP8 microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Germany) with a confocal 100 × NA 1.4 oil (n = 1.515) immersion objective lens with 495 nm excitation was used
to image the samples. The 3D images were obtained by scanning a series
of 2D images while moving the microscope stage in the axial direction.
The imaging was done in 24-bit 1024 × 1024 pixel format with
an average voxel size of 30 × 30 × 130 nm3, within
the ideal sampling interval according to the Nyquist criterion.40 The obtained 3D fluorescence stack images were
deconvoluted by applying the theoretical PSF calculated from microscopy
parameters, using a classic maximum likelihood estimation method.41 This process was carried out using commercially
available software (Huygens Professional 15.05, Scientific Volume
Imaging). For quantitative analysis, we used an open-source program
called SOAX42 (version: 3.5.9), which tracks
the centerlines of filamentous networks and their junctions by the
SOAC method.31 Prior to analysis, the deconvoluted
confocal microscopy images were downsized to 8-bit 512 × 512
pixel format, contrast-enhanced using ImageJ 1.49k, and then the voxel
size was made isotropic in all directions using the SOAX program.
Two main parameters that influence the extraction process are the
ridge threshold parameter (τ) that specifies the minimum intensity
to initialize an SOAC and the stretch factor (Kstr) that determines how easily the initialized SOAC evolves.
The optimal parameters for the extraction process, τ and Kstr, were obtained from the best SOAC program
by varying these parameters over a range for a representative image.
From the list of candidate extraction results of optimal parameters,
we manually selected a result that matched closely with the original
image. We used τ and Kstr values
in the range of 0.005–0.01 and 0.10–0.20, respectively,
depending on the fibril volume fraction. The confocal images were
further contrast-enhanced for display.

Analysis of the Fibril
Length between the Twists
The
periodic variation in intensity along the fibril contour observed
in confocal fluorescence images was correlated with the twists inherent
in the ribbon-shaped fibrils of the BC. The images were reconstructed
using SOAX to obtain the foreground intensity along the centerlines
of the fibrils. The distances between the subsequent minima in the
intensity profile data along the fibril length in 3D reveal the distance
between the twists. The analysis was carried out in Origin 9.1 using
the peak analyzer option to obtain the distance between the subsequent
minima. Prior to the analysis, the intensity profile obtained from
SOAX was smoothened by an adjacent averaging method to not take into
account the small fluctuations arising from imaging noise.
