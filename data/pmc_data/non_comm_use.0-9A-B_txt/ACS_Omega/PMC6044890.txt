Parkinson’s
disease is characterized by the self-assembly
of α-synuclein (AS), in which its aggregates accumulate in the
substantia nigra. The molecular mechanisms of the self-assembly of
AS are challenging because AS is a relatively large intrinsically
disordered protein, consisting of 140 residues. It is known that the
N-termini of AS contribute to the toxicity of the proteins; therefore,
it is important to investigate the self-assembly structure of the
N-termini on AS as well. There have been extensive efforts to investigate
the structural fibrils of AS(1–140), which have shown that
the N-termini are disordered and do not participate in the fibrillary
structure. This study illustrates for the first time that the N-termini
of AS play a crucial role in the self-assembly of AS. This study reveals
a new structure of AS(1–140) fibrils, in which the N-termini
are essential parts of the cross-β structure of the fibrillary
structure. This study suggests that there are polymorphic states of
the self-assembled AS(1–140). While the polymorphic states
of the N-termini do not participate in the fibrillary structure and
fluctuate, our predicted new fibrillary structure of the N-termini
not only participates in the fibrillary structure but also stabilizes
the fibrillary structure.

Introduction
Parkinson’s
disease is characterized by the formation of
intracellular deposits of α-synuclein (AS) in the neuropathological
inclusions “Lewy bodies” and “neurites”
that accumulate in the substantia nigra.1 AS is a 140-amino acid intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) and
has been shown to play a role in neurotransmitter release, as studied
by neuronal cell lines expressing AS.2 The
N-terminal region of AS is a positively charged region and includes
seven imperfect repeats of 11 residues containing the highly conserved
KTKEGV consensus sequence motif, whereas the C-terminus contains many
acidic residues and is, thus, negatively charged. Residues 61–95,
which are referred to the nonamyloid β component (NAC), encompass
many hydrophobic residues.

Upon binding negatively charged vesicles,
AS adopts a conformation
that has a high α-helical propensity.3,4 A
structure of the full-length, membrane-bound form of AS reveals a
conformation in which two-thirds of the N-terminal protein form a
broken, amphipathic α-helix.5,6 This structured
region of the protein is responsible for membrane binding, and residues
at the N-terminus are essential for this process.7 Moreover, it was suggested that the N-terminus contributes
to the toxicity of the protein. In the nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) structure of AS, the C-terminal tail remains flexible and is
structurally a random coil because of its low hydrophobicity and high
net negative charge.7

In solution,
the AS proteins are self-assembled into fibrils, forming
cross-β structures with a considerable morphological heterogenicity.8−10 Morphologically distinct AS fibrils lead to differences not only
in the dimensions of the fibril but also in the mechanical and physical
properties.11 Therefore, it is important
to investigate various morphologies of the self-assembled AS fibrils.

The molecular structure of the fibrillar NAC, that is, AS(61–95),
was first predicted by Atsmon-Raz and Miller, illustrating three β-strands
connected by two turns.12 A further molecular
structure of fibrillar AS(30–110) has been proposed by Xu et
al.13 based on a previous solid-state NMR
(ssNMR) model14 with five β-strands
packed in the conventional β-strand-loop-β-strand fold
(fivefold). The structure of the fibrillar NAC that had been predicted
by Xu et al.13 also consists of three β-strands
connected by two turns, but their locations along the sequence differ
from those proposed by the model of Atsmon-Raz and Miller.12 Recently, the molecular structure of the full-length
fibrillar structure of AS(1–140) has been solved using ssNMR,
illustrating in-register β-sheets with a Greek key (G-key) topology,
in which NAC is a part of this topology.15 The NAC domain in the model of the Rienstra group consists of six
β-strands connected by five turns. Therefore, obviously, when
focusing only on the NAC domain of the fibrillar molecular structure,
these three groups suggest three different folding states (Figure 1). The molecular
structure of the Rienstra group provided a well-organized molecular
structure of only residues 30–110, while the N- and the C-termini
have disordered regions.

61–95) in AS obtained from (A) Rienstra group,15 (B) Xu et al.,13 and (C) Atsmon-Raz
and Miller.12 Initial constructed models
of self-assembled AS(30–95) octamers. Model C1 is an ssNMR
structure observed by Rienstra group,15 model C2 is predicted from the computational study of Xu et al.,13 and model C3 is predicted in this study.

The aim of this study is to investigate
how the extensions of NAC
fibrils in the N- and C-termini in these three different models affect
the stability of the full-length AS(1–140) fibrils. The experimental
G-key model was extended in the N- and C-termini, but its full-length
stability has not yet been investigated. Recently, the stability of
AS(20–110) fibrils of the G-key model and the fivefold model
has been investigated by using computational tools.13,16 Yet, the full-length AS(1–140) fibrils have not been investigated.
Moreover, herein, we propose two new fibrillar structures: one is
of AS(30–95), which is an extension of NAC in the N-termini,
and the other is of the full-length AS(1–140), which is an
extension of NAC in both N- and C-termini. While
the N-termini and the C-termini of the G-key model and the fivefold
model are disordered, the new model that is presented in this study
demonstrates stably folded N-termini with the formation of a cross-β
structure.

Results and Discussion
Extensions of NAC Fibrils in the N-Termini
Yield to a New Fibrillary
Cross-β Structure in a Unique AS(30–95) Fibrillary Structure
While the NAC domain is indispensable for the aggregation of AS,17−19 there is still a great interest to investigate the aggregation of
the full-length AS(1–140). So far, a wide range of experimental
studies proposed that AS(30–95) consists of β-strands
along this sequence, whereas residues 1–29 and 96–140
lack β-strand structures.14,20−23 We first investigated the extension of the fibrillary structure
of NAC domains in the N-termini to form the fibrillary structure of
AS(30–95).

Three various fibrillary structures were investigated
in this study: C1–C3. The constructed models of these three
fibrillary structures are detailed in the Material and Methods section
and are seen in Figure 1. All of these three simulated models have shown stable fibrillary
structures (Figure 2); according to the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), all models
were converged (Figure S1). Energetically,
model C1 is the most stable and populated model than the two other
models, C2 and C3 (Figure S2, Table S1). Yet, one cannot neglect that all of
these three structures are applicable and populated (Figure S2, Table S1). The polymorphism
in various amyloids is well-known and reviewed elsewhere.24 Herein, we suggest that there are ensembles
of polymorphic states of the fibrillary structure of AS(30–95).

Figure 2 Simulated
models of the self-assembled AS(30–95) octamers.
Model C1 is an ssNMR structure observed by the Rienstra group,15 model C2 is predicted from the computational
study of Xu et al.,13 and model C3 is predicted
in this study.

The RMSD (Figure S1) and the hydrogen
analysis (Figure S3) illustrate that all
three models are converged and stable. Furthermore, the inner core
distances show stable fibrillar cross-β structures for all three
models (Figures S4–S6). Yet, although
these models are well-organized fibrillar structures, they show fluctuations
in the N-termini of each model, as seen in the root-mean-square fluctuation
(RMSF) analysis (Figure 3). The fluctuations in the N-termini of models
C1 and C2 are relatively high in comparison with that in model C3.
This is not surprising because the N-termini in model C3 are a part
of the fibrillary structure of AS, whereas the N-termini in models
C1 and C2 do not participate in interactions with other domains in
the fibrillary structures. Interestingly, one can see that the N-termini
in all three models are highly solvated and, particularly, that the
N-termini show relatively more fluctuations in models C1 and C2 than
that in model C3 (Figure S7). In fact, models C1 and C2 lack cross-β structures
in the N-termini domain, whereas model C3 demonstrates a cross-β
structure with an elongated sequence of residues (Figures S8–S10). Obviously, each model illustrates
different disordered domains and different β-strand domains
along the N-termini, according to the Define Secondary Structure of
Proteins (DSSP) analysis (Figures S8–S10). While model C3 exhibits a relatively high propensity of β-strand
domains along the sequence of A30-T44, model C2 shows a low propensity
and model C1 does not present any β-strand propensity along
this sequence.

Figure 3 RMSF analysis of all residues in models C1, C2, and C3.

The dihedral angles Φ and
Ψ of the residues in these
three models were computed and compared with the experimental values
(Tables S2 and S3 and Figures S11–S13). The averaged deviation of the computed
dihedral angles from the experimental values is in the range of 27–43%.
Interestingly, the averaged deviation is relatively small while also
considering the N-terminal residues in AS(30–95) compared with
the values of residues of only NAC. Finally, the computed order parameter
(OP) values of all three models have relatively small deviation compared
with the experimental OP values (Table S4 and Figure S14); yet, the computed OP
values of model C3 have the smallest deviation compared with the experimental
values. The relatively high deviations of the OP values of models
C1 and C2 do not indicate that these structural models are not feasible.
The differences in the OP values between these three models indicate
the polymorphic states of AS(30–95). Obviously, the
polymorphic states of the self-assembled amyloids that were observed
by the experiment are due to different conditions of the growth of
amyloids.

Previously, the group of Riek revealed similar diameter
values
for the full-length AS(1–140) and the nonfull-length AS(30–110),14 thus providing support for the premise that
the central domain of AS plays a role in fibrillization. Therefore,
it is reasonable to compare the diameters of our three models with
those observed in the experimental studies. The group of Riek suggested
a fibril diameter of 5.5 ± 0.5 nm based on two protofilaments
of ∼2 nm.14 The group of Carter
showed protofilament diameters of 3.8 ± 0.6 nm,25 and the group of Anderson observed protofilaments with
a diameter of 4.5–6 nm.26 Recently,
the group of Melki has suggested that the diameter values within the
same fibrillary structure vary from the narrow value of 8 ± 1
nm to the wider value of 18 ± 2 nm along the fibril axis.8Figure S15 shows the
various heterogeneous diameter values of the simulated models. Interestingly,
all simulated models are in good agreement with the various experimental
diameter values, thus indicating the polymorphic states of the self-assembled
AS(30–95).

Extensions of NAC Fibrils in the N- and C-Termini
Domain Yield
to Well-Organized Cross-β Structure in These Domains in a New
AS(1–140) Fibrillary Structure
The study of the self-assembly
of the full-length AS(1–140) is more challenging because of
the relatively long sequence in comparison with that of amylin and
Aβ amyloid. Previous ssNMR studies have struggled to solve the
three-dimensional (3D) structure of the self-assembled AS(1–140)
with no success.14,20−23 Recently, the Rienstra group
has succeeded to solve the self-assembled 3D structure of AS(1–140).15 Herein, we applied the structure of the Rienstra
group (model C5, Figure 4), and we constructed a new structural model of AS(1–140)—model
C4, which differs from the structure of the Rienstra group (Figure 4). Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were carried out for these two models, which are
shown in Figure 4. Both
models have shown a convergence along the time of simulations (Figure S16). Estimation of the conformational
energies of these two models has shown that model C5 is relatively
more stable than model C4 (Figure 5, Table S5). Yet, one cannot
neglect the overlap between the distribution of energies of these
two models. In fact, similar results have been shown previously for
other amyloids in our group,24,27−29 which indicate some fibrillary amyloid structures that are more
preferred than others but still present polymorphic states.

Figure 4 Initial (left)
and simulated (right) self-assembled structural
models of AS(1–140) octamers. Model C4 is predicted in this
study and model C5 is the ssNMR structure by Tuttle et al.15

Although the conformational energy of C5 is lower than that
of
C4, the new model C4 is structurally more stable than C5. Interestingly,
one can see that the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions along
the N-termini stabilize the fibrillary structure of model C4 (Figure 6). After the convergence
of these two models, the percentage of hydrogen bonds (Figure S17) in model C4 is higher than that in
C5 because of the relatively low fluctuations at the N- and C-termini
of AS(1–140) of C4 when compared with that of C5 (Figure 5). Furthermore, model
C4 exhibits more β-strands along the N-termini (residues 14–29)
and C-termini (residues 96–105) than model C5 (Figures S18–S21). The various inner cores
of each model have been computed and illustrated in Figures S22 and S23. These inner cores led us to conclude
that the well-organized self-assembled fibrillary structure of model
C4 is located along AS(14–105), whereas in model C5 it is located
along AS(30–95).

“boxes”. (B) RMSF analysis of all residues in models

Figure 6 Illustration of interactions in the N-terminal
of a monomer in
the fibrillary structure of the simulated model C4: hydrophobic (green)
and electrostatic (red) interactions stabilize the fibrillary structure
in the N-terminal.

Finally, the dihedral
angles Φ and Ψ of the residues
in these two models were computed and compared with the experimental
values (Tables S6 and S7 and Figures S24 and S25). The averaged deviation
of the computed dihedral angles from the experimental values is in
the range of 32–55%. Interestingly, the deviation from the
experiment is relatively small while considering the full-length AS(1–140)
when compared with the NAC domain only. Obviously, these small deviations
are due to the fact that the experimental values were measured for
the full-length AS(1–140).

The fibril diameter of model
C4 is ∼8.6 nm, which is in
agreement with the experimental diameter value of Melki group,8 and that of model C5 is ∼4.4 nm (Figure S26), which is in agreement with the experimental
value of Anderson group.26 Interestingly,
these fibrillar diameter values of the full-length AS(1–140)—models
C5 and C4 are similar to those of AS(30–95)—models C1
and C3, respectively. This indicates that the full-length models conserve
the fibrillary diameter dimension, whereas model C4 has the well-ordered
fibrillar structure of AS(14–105) and model C5 exhibits the
fibrillary structure of AS(30–95). The other domains in the
N- and C-termini show fluctuation and thus do not participate in the
formation of the fibrillary structures.

Extensions of N-Termini
and C-Termini of AS(30–95) Affect
the Structural Stability of the Folded Self-Assembled State
The self-assembly of AS(30–95) presents a well-organized structure
of both models C4 and C5, but the extensions of the N- and C-termini
to the full-length AS(1–140) may affect the structural stability.
Obviously, the self-assembly of both models of AS(30–95)—models
C1 and C3 and that of both models of AS(1–140)—models
C4 and C5 were converged during the MD simulations (Figures S1 and S16). Interestingly, the convergence of the
structures of AS(1–140) yields lower values of RMSD when compared
with the structures of AS(30–95). Moreover, our predicted models
C3 and C4 illustrate lower RMSD values than models C1 and C5 because
of the relatively large number of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions
between β-strands that form more inner cores than those of models
C1 and C5.

Extensions of the N- and C-termini of C1 to C5 do
not change the central inner cores (distances R2, R3, and R4 in Figures S4 and S22), but the inner cores in the
ends are increased (distances R1, R5, and R6 in Figure S22) because of the relatively high fluctuations in
the termini (Figure S27). Yet, the inner
cores still present stable cores: the distances between two β-strands
are less than 15 Å. Extensions of the N- and C-termini of our
predicted structures of C3 to C4 and those of Rienstra’s models
yield an increase in the inner cores in the ends (i.e., distances
R1 and R2 in Figures S6 and S23). However,
new inner cores were constructed at R3–R9 in model C4 (Figure S23), and the distance between the inner
cores R4 and R6 illustrated stable cores along the MD simulations.
The distances between two β-strands in these inner cores are
less than 14 Å.

In fact, our predicted structural model
of AS(1–140) illustrates
a well-organized cross-β structure along the sequence of AS(14–109),
whereas the full-length model of the Rienstra group demonstrates a
cross-β structure along the shorter sequence of AS(30–95).
The DSSP analyses show that our predicted structure, model C4, has
more ordered β-strands at the N- and C-termini than those of
the structural model C5 of the Rienstra group (Figures S18–S21). It is not surprising that the termini
in the model of the Rienstra group have less ordered structure because
the termini show more fluctuations than our predicted model (Figure S27). These N- and C-termini in model
C5 are more exposed to water than that in model C4 because of the
fluctuations and the disordered domains (Figure S28). Moreover, the extensions in the model of the Rienstra
group destabilize the N-termini of AS(35–50), whereas the extensions
in our predicted model stabilize this domain (Figure S27). This domain is stabilized in our predicted model
because of the formation of more inner cores and formation of more
cross-β structures along the sequence; therefore, the production
of multiple cross-β structures stabilizes the termini of AS(1–140).

Finally, the diameter values of AS(30–95) and AS(1–140)
were computed along the MD simulations (Figure S26). The diameter values of the fibrillary structure of our
predicted models AS(30–95)—C3 and AS(1–140)—C4
are similar: 8.5 nm, which is in agreement with the experimental values
of Melki group.8 A further diameter value
has been measured in C4: 4.5 nm, which is in agreement with the experimental
values of Anderson group.26 The diameter
values of the fibrillary structure of the models AS(30–95),
model C1, and AS(1–140), model C5 of the Rienstra group, are
similar: 4.5 nm, which are in agreement with the experimental values
of Anderson group.26 The additional diameter
value of C5 is ∼3.8 nm, which is in agreement with the group
of Carter.25 These various diameter values
demonstrate polymorphic states of the fibrillary structure of AS(1–140).

Conclusions
AS is a 140-amino acid IDP, and it is self-assembled
into oligomers
and fibrils. The molecular mechanisms through which AS is self-assembled
are elusive. There have been extensive efforts to solve the 3D structure
of the fibrillary AS(1–140) using ssNMR with no success.14,21−23 Recently, the group of Rienstra has solved for the
first time the 3D structure of the full-length AS fibrils.15 This study proposes a further new 3D structure
of AS(1–140) fibrils, which differs from the ssNMR model of
the Rienstra group. It is well-known that the self-assembled amyloids
are polymorphic;24,30−34 therefore, it is also expected that AS may demonstrate
the polymorphic states of AS fibrils.

The novelty of this study
is the elongated sequence of AS that
forms a cross-β structure in the new proposed 3D structure.
While the ssNMR model of the Rienstra group illustrates a well-organized
cross-β structure along residues 30–95, the 3D model
that is proposed in this study demonstrates a stable cross-β
structure along residues 14–109 in AS. Although, energetically,
the new proposed model is relatively less stable than the model of
the Rienstra group, structurally the new model shows a stable cross-β
structure with less fluctuations along the N-termini of the fibrillary
structure.

This study provides for the first time the knowledge
of polymorphism
in AS fibrils. Obviously, the polymorphic states of AS fibrils are
produced because of the different experimental conditions of the growth
of these fibrils. There may also be several structures that may be
produced during aggregation; however, only one will be more dominant
than others. Our study has shown that at the molecular level so far
there are two potential fibrillary structures of AS. It is expected
that future studies will show further polymorphic states of AS fibrils
that could be found by further studies, as has been found previously
in Aβ amyloid35−37 and amylin.27,38 The observation of
the polymorphic states of AS will assist in understanding the various
molecular mechanisms of the self-assembly of AS and, consequently,
will provide an important knowledge for the design drugs to inhibit
the aggregations of AS.

Materials and Methods
Construction of AS(30–95)
Octamer Fibril-Like Models
The first structural AS(30–95)
fibrillar model C1 (Figure 1) has been constructed
from the G-key 3D structure of the self-assembled AS(1–140).15 The residues 1–29 and 96–140 were
removed to construct the self-assembled structures of AS(30–95),
that is, examining only the effect of the N-termini extension of the
NAC domain. We further examined the self-assembled structures of AS(30–95)
based on the fivefold model that consists of residues 30–110.13 In C2 model (Figure 1), the residues 96–110 in the original
fivefold model were removed.

In this study, we predicted a new
self-assembled AS(30–95) fibril-like structure—model
C3 (Figure 1). Our
predicted self-assembled AS(30–95), model C3, is based on an
experimental ssNMR experiment that proposed the secondary structure
(i.e., β-strands) for AS fibrils, but with a lack of 3D structures.14 We applied the self-assembled NAC(61–95)
fibril-like structure that has been predicted in our group12 and extended the N-termini domain (residues
30–60) that considers the location of the β-strands along
the sequence, as suggested by the experiment (see details in the Supporting Information).14 We further examined various predicted models for AS(30–95),
which are based on various available experimental models that lack
the 3D structures. Scheme S1 illustrates
the available experimental predicted models of AS(30–95). The
prediction of the various 3D self-assembled AS(30–95), based
on these available experimental models, that had been examined and
shown in unstable fibrillar structures are detailed in the Supporting Information. The successfully predicted
self-assembled structure, model C3, illustrated a converged and stable
cross-β structure along all time scale of the simulations. It
should be noted that the previous self-assembled NAC, that is, AS(61–95)
fibril-like structure that had been predicted in our group was also
based on the same ssNMR experimental model that was applied for model
C3.

Construction of AS(1–140) Octamer Fibril-Like Models
We further investigated the structural stability of the full-length
AS(1–140) fibrils to study the effect of extension of the self-assembled
NAC fibrils to the N- and C-termini. We applied C3 of AS(30–95)
and extended the C- and N-termini to construct AS(1–140) fibrillar
structures. To extend the termini to form a 3D structure is a challenging
issue because there is a lack of structural properties in these domains.
We, therefore, extended the termini while forming maximum hydrophobic
and electrostatic interactions between the residues along the folded
structure, particularly in the inner cores (model C4, Figure 4). We further investigated
the ssNMR full-length AS(1–140) fibrils that have been recently
solved by Rienstra15 (model C5, Figure 4). We investigated
this model because the N- and C-termini are parallel-oriented; thus,
it is expected that interactions between the residues in the N- and
C-termini will be produced during the simulations to form stable cross-β
structures. On the other hand, in the fivefold model, the N-termini
and the C-termini are oppositely oriented. Therefore, it is expected
that the interactions between the residues in the N- and C-termini
will not be produced during the simulations; thus, the lack of interactions
may lead to the unstable structure in these domains, that is, these
termini will be disordered. Indeed, simulations of these termini in
the fivefold model have shown disordered domains in the full-length
AS(1–140).16

MD Simulation Protocol
We constructed the fibril-like
AS models by using the Accelrys Discovery Studio software (http://accelrys.com/products/discovery-studio/), as detailed in the previous sections. MD simulations of the solvated
octamers were performed in the NPT (N−number of particles;
P−pressue; T−temperature) ensemble using nanoscale molecular
dynamics (NAMD)39 with the CHARMM27 force
field.40,41 The octamers were energy-minimized and explicitly
solvated in a TIP3P42,43 water box with a minimal distance
of 15 Å from each edge of the box. All water molecules within
2.5 Å of the octamers were removed. Counterions were added at
random locations to neutralize the charge on the octamers. The Langevin
piston method39,44,45 was applied with a decay period of 100 fs, and a damping time of
50 fs was used to maintain a constant pressure of 1 atm. The temperature
was controlled at 330 K by a Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient
of 10 ps.39 Short-range van der Waals interactions
were calculated using a switching function, with a twin range cutoff
of 10.0 and 12.0 Å. Long-range electrostatic interactions were
calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method with a cutoff of 12.0
Å.46,47 The equations of motion were integrated
using the leapfrog integrator with a step of 1 fs. The solvated systems
were energy-minimized for 2000-conjugated gradient steps, where the
hydrogen-bonding distance between the β-sheets in each octamer
was fixed in the range of 2.2–2.5 Å.

The counterions
and the water molecules were allowed to move. The hydrogen atoms were
constrained to the equilibrium bond by using the SHAKE algorithm.48 The minimized solvated systems were energy-minimized
for 2000 additional conjugate gradient steps and 20 000 heating
steps at 250 K, with all atoms being allowed to move. Then, the system
was heated from 250 to 330 K for 300 ps and equilibrated at 330 K
for 300 ps. Simulations were performed at a temperature higher than
the physiological temperature (310 K), with the aim of investigating
the stability of the constructed models. Obviously, structures that
are stable at 330 K will also be stable at lower temperatures. All
simulations were run for 80 ns. These conditions were applied to test
the stabilities of all constructed models.

To further examine
whether the time scale of 80 ns is a reasonable
choice, RMSD was computed for models C1–C3 of AS(30–95)
(Figure S1) and models C4 and C5 of AS(1–140)
(Figure S16) along the MD simulations.
One can see that all of these simulated and constructed models were
converged after 20–40 ns of the simulations, therefore indicating
that the time scale of 80 ns is a reasonable choice. Moreover, the
DSSP analysis was performed for each simulated model for all frames
of 80 ns and for only to the last 500 frames, that is, the last 5
ns of the simulations (Figures S8–S10,S17–S20). Interestingly, the DSSP results were similar to these two time
scales for each model, thus indicating that all simulated models were
converged. Furthermore, to validate the convergence of the simulated
models, we computed the conformational energies using the generalized
Born method and molecular volume (GBMV) method and population analysis
of all simulated models after 60 and 80 ns of the simulations. Interestingly,
one can see that the relative conformational energies and the populations
yielded a similar trend as obtained for 60 ns (Tables S1 and S5), thus indicating that 80 ns is definitely
a satisfactory time scale.

GBMV Method
To obtain the relative
stability and the
populations of the variant models of the self-assembled AS(30–95)
octamer models and the full-length AS(1–140) octamer models,
the trajectories of the models for the last 5 ns were first extracted
from the explicit MD simulation, excluding water molecules. The solvation
energies of all systems were calculated using GBMV.49,50 In the GBMV calculations, the dielectric constant of water was set
to 80.0. The hydrophobic solvent-accessible surface area term factor
was set to 0.00592 kcal mol–1 Å–2. Each variant was minimized by 1000 cycles, and the conformational
energy was evaluated by a grid-based GBMV. The minimization did not
change the conformations of each model but merely relaxed the local
geometries caused by the thermal fluctuations that occurred during
the MD simulations.

A total of 1500 conformations of AS(30–95)
(500 conformations for each of the three examined models: C1–C3)
and 1000 conformations of the full-length AS(1–140) (500 conformations
for each of the two examined models: C4 and C5) were used to construct
the free-energy landscapes of the conformers and to evaluate the conformer
probabilities by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. In the first
step, one conformation of conformer i and one conformation
of conformer j were randomly selected. Then, the
Boltzmann factor was computed as e–(Ej – Ei)/KT, where Ei and Ej are the conformational energies evaluated
by GBMV calculations for the respective conformations i and j, K is the Boltzmann constant,
and T is the absolute temperature (298 K used here).
If the Boltzmann value is larger than a random number, the change
from conformation i to conformation j is allowed. After one million steps, the conformations visited for
each conformer were counted. Finally, the relative probability of
a conformer n was evaluated to be Pn = Nn/Ntotal, where Pn is the population of conformer n, Nn is the
total number of conformations visited for the conformer n, and Ntotal is the total number of steps.
The advantages of using MC simulations to estimate the conformer probability
rely on its good numerical stability and the control that they allow
in the transition probabilities among several conformers.

For
the complex kinetics of amyloid formation, a group of three
conformers of AS(30–95) and two conformers of the full-length
AS(1–140) likely represent only a very small percentage of
the ensemble. Nevertheless, the carefully selected models cover the
most likely structures. This includes the two models that were constructed
directly from the experimental results that were reported by the Rienstra
group15,20 and the models that were examined by presenting
maximum interactions to stabilize the structures.

Structural
Analysis Details
We examined the structural
stability of the studied octamer models by following the changes in
the average number of hydrogen bonds between β-strands, with
the hydrogen bond cutoff being set to 2.5 Å. This examination
was performed by following RMSDs and RMSFs and by monitoring the change
in the intersheet distances (Cα backbone–backbone distances)
in the core domains of all of the examined structures. We calculated
the average distance while excluding the values obtained from the
monomers at the ends of each oligomer, therefore sampling six monomers
in each model. For each model, different pairs of atoms were chosen
to allow the most accurate evaluation of the distance within the inner
cores of the cross-β structural models. Schemes S2 and S3 illustrate the various intersheet distances
in the various core domains for each of the examined models C1–C5.
Finally, we investigated the average number of water molecules around
each side-chain Cβ atom within 4 Å for all simulated models.

Secondary Structure Analysis
In addition to the DSSP
analysis, the secondary structures of the simulated octamers, models
C1–C5, were determined by computing and averaging the backbone
dihedral angles Ψ and Φ of the last 500 frames from the
MD simulations, for each residue. The Ψ ranges of (−60)°–(−120)°
and 90°–180° for Φ were defined as the values
of a β-strand structure. The average computed dihedral angles
for each residue that had been extracted from the MD simulations were
compared with the experimental dihedral angles.20,23

Calculations of OPs from MD Simulations
OPs for various 13C–1H and 15N–1H bonds were calculated from the last 5 ns of the MD trajectories
(500 frames/snapshots) for each model, as detailed by Vogel et al.51 For the 15N–1H
dipole–dipole interactions, DNH was calculated according to the bond length of 1.04 Å20 and for 13C–1H,
we used a value for DCH that was computed
according to the bond length of 1.1 Å.52 In short, OPs were computed for each residue from the tensor of
a dipolar interaction averaged over all MD simulation frames. We extracted
the vector coordinates of the bonds that were detailed by Comellas
et al.;20 thus, we compared the computed
OPs with those of Comellas et al.20 To
avoid anomalies from the peripheral monomers, we calculated the average
of the OP values of 13C–1H and 15N–1H while excluding the monomers that are in the
ends of the fibrillary structures. Therefore, we sampled only six
monomers in each model.

Estimation of Diameter Dimensions
To estimate the diameter
dimensions, we chose each of the final simulated structural models
(and not the initial structural models) because all of these final
structural models have been converged structurally. We measured the
diameters/distances for each model, as shown in Schemes S4 and S5.
