Mesoporous
CeO2 nanospheres with appreciably high surface
area are prepared using reversed micelles by a water-in-oil microemulsion
method. The structural morphology and semiconducting properties of
the nanoparticles are thoroughly investigated using X-ray diffraction,
field effect scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
and UV–visible spectroscopic techniques. Even after high-temperature
calcination, the morphological retention of the material is apparent
by electron microscopy. The deployment of undoped CeO2 nanospheres
for the detection of low-ppm CO yields superior performances in terms
of sensitivity, response–recovery times, and selectivity compared
to those of other sensors of the same genre. These CO sensors exhibit
∼ 52% sensitivity with a response time of only 13 s. The sensor
parameters are analyzed as a function of both temperature and gas
concentration. In addition to that on the cost-effective and scalable
synthesis of CeO2 nanospheres, this article also reports
on the fabrication of packaged CO sensors, which can be potentially
utilized for industrial and environmental monitoring purposes.

Introduction
CeO2 is
a widely applied rare-earth oxide material in
many fields such as catalysts, optics, and gas sensors because of
its unique properties, arising peculiarly from its 4f shells.1 Cerium being the most abundant nontoxic element
in the Earth’s crust, CeO2 is one of the most used
catalysts for the reduction of toxic gases, like CO, NOx, hydrocarbons, etc., emit from automobile exhausts.
High oxygen storage capacity, huge oxygen vacancies, and low redox
potential between Ce3+ and Ce4+ have made this
oxide an advantageous sensing material toward reducing gases.2−6 Because of the rapid growth of industries and population, CO is
one of the most life-threatening gases in today’s world causing
severe health hazards. As per the specifications of World Health Organization
(WHO) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the
time-weighted average exposure limit of carbon monoxide is 9 ppm for
8 h, 26 ppm over 1 h, and 35 ppm for 8 h, respectively. Thus it is
essential to develop sensors for the detection of CO in air below
the permissible exposure limit with fast alarming response.7,8 Although CeO2 is reported to be one of the most suitable
materials for the said purpose because of its aforementioned advantageous
properties, very few reports are available in the literature on the
development of CO sensors using undoped bare pristine CeO2. There are reports on the detection of oxygen by resistive CeO2 sensors, consisting of thick or thin films of CeO2.9,10 The morphological properties and surface porosities
have also been analyzed in the light of their sensing performances.11−13 Xuan et al. reported the development of a CS2–CeO2 sensor where the intensity of the emitted chemiluminescence
was recorded as a signal, associated with the gas concentration.14 Izu et al. furnished a screen-printed thick
film CeO2 sensor for SO2 gas sensing application.15 More such articles are published on CO sensing
using doped, undoped, or composites of ceria.16,17 Durrani et. al reported on the CO gas-sensing properties of electron-beam-deposited
CeO2 thin films where the lower limit of detection (LOD)
was 500 ppm at the operating temperature of 390 °C having response
and recovery times of 45 and 25 s, respectively.18 Michel and his co-workers have synthesized a three-dimensional
hierarchical CeO2 nanostructure following a simple microwave-assisted
coprecipitation method and deployed the same for CO sensing. Although
the operating temperature of their bare CeO2-based CO sensors
was lowered with fast response and recovery times, the LOD of the
sensors was 300 ppm, which is impractically high for real-field application.19

This work outlines the reverse micelle
method for synthesizing
highly porous CeO2 nanomaterials with the plausible formation
mechanism and deployment of bare materials for low-ppm CO gas sensing
application. The influence of the porosity of the material is discussed
as morphological boon toward CO sensing. We also report on the optimum
operating temperature and appreciably fast response–recovery
times of the sensors for real-field application purposes, which are
comparably better than those of any other sensors of the same genre.
The longibility of the said sensors is also studied in terms of their
respective sensor parameters.

Experimental Section
Material Synthesis
All of the chemicals of analytical
grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purifications.
First, a microemulsion was prepared by mixing diethyl ether, n-butyl alcohol, and n-hexane in the weight
ratio 1:2:3 with vigorous stirring until the mixture became transparent.
The amount of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to form critical
micelle concentration (CMC) was determined following the standard
conductometric method, where a series of microemulsions were analyzed
varying the CTAB concentration from 0.2 to 1.5 g (detailed in Figure S1). Then, 10 mL of 1 M aqueous solution
of cerium nitrate containing 0.65 g of CTAB was added to the mixture
and the mixture was stirred again till it became transparent. Simultaneously,
another aqueous solution of 10% (w/v) NH4OH was prepared.
The above solutions were mixed vigorously until a colloidal suspension
was formed. The material was collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm
for 30 min and successively washed using deionized water in an ultrasonic
bath for 2 h. Finally, the collected material was dried under vacuum
and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h.

Characterization Techniques
The phase analysis of the
sample was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance,
Cu Kα line). Morphological analyses were performed by a field
effect scanning electron microscope (FESEM CarlZeiss-Supra35VP) system
and high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, model:
TECNAI G2 30ST; manufacturer: FEI Company, The Netherlands). The optical
property was studied using Shimadzu UV 2450, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area was measured using Quantachrome Instruments, version
3.0. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using
a Nano S Malvern instrument deploying a 4 mW He–Ne laser (I 1/4632.8 nm), which is equipped with a thermostated sample
chamber. The scattered photons are collected at a scattering angle
of 173°. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was performed using
a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog fluorimeter by irradiating the sample
at λex = 320 nm. During CMC determination, the conductometric
measurement was carried out using an HI 8733 conductivity meter.

Fabrication of Sensors
Gas-sensing measurements were
performed using Taguchi-type sensors consisting of an insulating cylindrical
alumina substrate with terminal gold electrodes (using gold paste
and cured at 950 °C for 1 h).17 During
substrate making, the alumina tubes were cut into specific dimensions
(length 4 mm, outer diameter 2 mm, and inner diameter 1 mm). After
that, both the edges of the tubes were polished vigorously using sand
paper and washed using HCl, distilled water, and finally acetone.
Connecting wires of Platinum were attached to these tubular substrates
and mounted onto a 6-pin holder by spot-welding. The sensor substrate
had a coaxial heating element inside (Ni–Cr wire), and the
sensing CeO2 material was coated on top of it using isopropyl
alcohol. The viscosity of the coating material was optimized to get
a final coating of around 50 μm thickness. The curing of sensors
was done at 400 °C for 1 h. The curing process brings stability
to the coating. Finally, the sensors were packaged by spot-welding
on nickel pins fixed on polymer sensor heads and covered with a stainless
steel mesh. The mesh works as a deflagration arrester.

Gas-Sensing
Measurement
Upon injection of a target
analyte (CO in air in the concentration range of 10–30 ppm),
the drop in resistance of the sensors was measured as a signal by
an Agilent B2901A Source Meter using LabView-based graphical user
interface. A series of mass flow controllers were used to get the
desired CO concentration at 1 atm pressure under the flow rate of
50 sccm. It is to be mentioned that the required operating temperature
for the sensor module was set by changing the current driven through
the heating element (Ni–Cr wire), which was inserted in the
alumina substrate.

Results and Discussion
Crystallographic and Morphological
Analyses
Crystallographic
analysis of the synthesized material reveals the formation of anatase
CeO2 nanostructures, and the peaks at (111), (200), (220),
(311), (222), (400), and (331) in Figure 1 match with the face-centered cubic (fcc)
phases as provided in JCPDS card no. 34-1394. Figure 2 shows the morphology of the CeO2 materials. Figure 2a,b is the FESEM and TEM micrographs, respectively. They show the
formation of spherelike structures. The well-dispersed nanospheres
are of average diameter ∼50 nm. The inset of Figure 2a depicts the particle size
distribution plot showing the average diameter of the particles to
be 50–55 nm. The inset of Figure 2b presents the HRTEM image of the nanospheres
showing the characteristic lattice fringes of CeO2. Another
FESEM image of monodispersed spherical CeO2 nanoparticles
is provided in Figure S2. Figure 2c provides the energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (EDAX) analyses of the material, showing the peak of
only Ce, which confirms that no other impurity is present. Figure 2d represents the
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern showing bright spots
referring to crystalline nature of the sample. The retention of spherical
morphology of CeO2 is found to be unaltered after calcination
at 600 °C. The corresponding TEM micrograph is provided in the
Supporting Information Section (Figure S3). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm study was carried
out, and the determined Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
specific surface area of the CeO2 materials was found to
be 773.31 cm3/g, which is moderately high. Figure 3 delineates the corresponding
isotherm with the pore size distribution curve (inset). As expected,
because of the high surface area, the CeO2 nanospheres
are found to be porous in nature with average pore diameter ∼90
Å and pore volume 0.57 cm3/g. The porous CeO2 nanospheres are obtained using a “water-in-oil”-type
microemulsion-based reaction method. Generally, this type of microemulsions
are prepared using two immiscible liquids and a surfactant. They are
also distinguished as a thermodynamically stable system, where the
aqueous phase is dispersed as droplets covered with surfactant molecules
and cosurfactant molecules exist in the nonpolar organic solvent.
Here, the same type of microemulsions are prepared using diethyl ether, n-butyl alcohol, n-hexane, CTAB, and aqueous
solution of cerium nitrate, which led to the formation of reverse
micelles. Besides the type of the emulsion, the geometric parameters
of the surfactant, such as length (l), volume of
the hydrophobic tail (v), and cross section of the
hydrophilic head (a), play an important role in determining
the nature of the micelles formed. Together, they are formulated as P = (v/al). If P >1, reverse micelle is formed.20 A pictorial representation is given in the Supporting Information
section (Figure S4). Indeed, it is worth
mentioning that the P value is reported to be always
greater than 1 for CTAB. The formation of micelles strictly depends
on the surfactant concentration because it controls the CMC when the
micelle formations are initiated. As delineated in the experimental
section, the CMC is determined by conductometric measurements, as
shown in Figure S1, where increasing the
amount of CTAB from 0.2 to 1.5 g, the corresponding conductivity is
recorded. The associated slope in the plot clearly shows an inflection
point, indicating the generation of CMC at 0.65 g of CTAB. Upon reaching
the CMC, in a water-in-oil-type system, CTAB molecules assemble themselves;
commonly known as micelles. In the newly formed micelle, the hydrophobic
aliphatic tails of CTAB molecules are exposed on the outside (nonpolar)
of the spherical micelle and the hydrophilic heads are aggregated
into the core. Because of this hydrophilic core, the aqueous solution
of cerium nitrate gets dissolved in the nonpolar system. Following
the same way, NH4OH, insoluble in a nonpolar system, also
gets solubilized. With the formation of micelles, distinct swelled
phases, called microemulsions, are established. Then, because of the
diffusion inside the system, the collision of micelles takes place,
resulting in the destruction of the CTAB layer around the reverse
micelles. Subsequently, an exchange of contents takes place between
the aqueous droplets of two existing microemulsions, which are cerium
nitrate microemulsion and NH4OH microemulsion. As a consequence,
a reaction occurs between them, and this phenomenon leads to the formation
of well-dispersed spherelike CeO2 nanoparticles.21 The corresponding schematic of the formation
mechanism of CeO2 nanospheres is illustrated in Figure 4. Here, in this work,
spherical CeO2 nanoparticles were prepared following the
reverse micelle method and the concentration of the surfactant was
the critical micelle concentration, constant for that particular reaction
medium. Here, the cerium precursor is cerium nitrate, in which Ce
is in a +3 trivalent state. Thus, one cerium nitrate molecule requires
three NH4OH molecules. Here, the concentrations of the
precursors were kept in such a way that cerium nitrate is of 1 M and
the 10% (w/v) NH4OH is of ∼3 M. Thus, their molar
ratio is 1:3. In the microemulsion synthesis process, the final size
of the nanoparticles is restricted as the chemical reaction takes
place inside the water droplets within the reversed micelles. The
surfactant molecules get adsorbed on the surface of the particles
to protect them from further particle growth, once the particles reach
a critical size in the droplets. Thus, microemulsion methods are very
useful to obtain monodispersed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution.
Here, we have varied the concentration of cerium nitrate from 0.5
to 2 M keeping the other parameters constant and the size of the resulted
CeO2 nanoparticles was analyzed using DLS measurements
(Figure S5). They show a narrow size distribution
and ∼50 nm as the average size of the particles in each case.
However, with the increase in concentration of cerium nitrate, the
formation of slightly larger particles is reported.21 In Figure S5, the peak of the
distribution is slightly shifted to the a larger particle side for
the highest concentration. After several washings of the collected
CeO2 materials, some remnants of CTAB remain there. Upon
calcination, the remnant surfactant gets burnt away and, simultaneously,
it perforates the material, resulting in enormous porosity in CeO2 nanospheres. The huge porosity of the material plays a pivotal
role in the effective surface area and adsorption–desorption
isotherm during CO gas sensing. The nature of the isotherm in Figure 3 deviates from that
in the Langmuir model of adsorption. The intermediate flat portion
in the isotherm is attributed to the formation of a monolayer, which
is a key factor behind the better performance of the solid-state gas
sensor in terms of the response (τres) and recovery
(τrec) times of the said sensor. The characteristic
UV–visible peak of CeO2 is seen at 363 nm in Figure 5, and the corresponding
band gap of the sensing material was obtained by plotting the Schuster–Kubelka–Munk
absorption function, (αhν)1/n, against the photon energy (hν)
according to eq 1. 1  where A, h, n,
and α are proportionality constant, Planck’s
constant, frequency of vibration, and absorption coefficient, respectively.
Here, n = 2 for direct transition. The band gap is
2.88 eV, calculated from the straight line x-intercept,
as presented in the inset of Figure 5. In general the band gap of CeO2 is ≥3
eV. Narrowing of band gap in CeO2 nanospheres makes it
a better semiconductor material for gas-sensing applications. In addition,
oxygen vacancy also has a strong influence. The presence of oxygen
vacancies is confirmed using PL spectroscopy (Figure S6) with excitation wavelength 320 nm. The formation
of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 is represented by the Kröger–Vink
equation,22 Oo× + 2CeCe× = Vo•• + 2CeCe′ + 1/2O2, where
Oo× is
the O2– ion on the oxygen lattice site; CeCe× and CeCe′ are Ce4+ and Ce3+, respectively; and Vo•• is doubly charged
oxygen vacancy, and its formation releases two free electrons. These
electrons are captured by Ce4+ and get transformed into
Ce3+ ions. The resulted oxygen vacancies with the formation
of Ce3+ ions lead to a lattice distortion, which has a
direct correlation with the narrowing of band gap of the sensing material.
As reported in the literature, the emission energy is 3.0–3.38
eV for de-excitation of the electrons to the valence band in CeO2. The PL emission is thus assumed to be due to the transition
from the 4f band of Ce to the 2p band of O, and the emission peaks
ranging from 350 to 575 nm, observed in Figure S6, are assigned to the results of defects including oxygen
vacancies.23−25

Gas-Sensing Characteristics
In our studies, carbon
monoxide (at varied concentrations) was the target gas, whereas high-purity
nitrogen (99.99%) was used as the diluent. During calibration, the
packaged sensors were kept at the operating temperature (using an
in-built heating element). Thus, when the baseline data were recorded,
the sensors were exposed to laboratory air, which contains about 21%
oxygen. The oxygen molecules from air get adsorbed on the surface
of the metal oxide. Owing to its high electron affinity, each adsorbed
oxygen atom captures free electrons in the metal oxide, forming a
potential barrier at the grain boundaries of the nanoparticles. This
potential barrier perturbs the electron flow, causing high sensor
resistance in air (laboratory ambient). When the sensors were exposed
to a reducing gas like carbon monoxide, the oxidation reaction of
the target gas with adsorbed oxygen occurred at the surface of cerium
oxide. Because the diluent was nitrogen gas, the partial pressure
of oxygen on the sensor surface was minimized. This facilitated the
oxidation reaction of carbon monoxide on the sensor surface. As a
result of oxidation reaction, the surface coverage of the adsorbed
oxygen on the metal oxide surface decreased and the height of the
potential barrier reduced. Subsequently, the electron flow through
the reduced potential barrier became facile and the sensor resistance
decreased. The concentration of CO in air thus could be detected by
measuring the change in resistance of the sensors. The operating temperature
plays a significant role in gas-sensing measurements. To fix the operating
temperature, the CeO2 sensors were exposed to different
operating temperatures ranging from 250 to 500 °C using different
concentrations of CO as a target analyte. From Figure 6a, it is observed that for all of the cases,
sensitivity of the sensors increases with an increase in temperature,
becomes highest at 400 °C, and then attains saturation. Considering
the thermal budget, 400 °C is determined as the operating temperature
of the CeO2 sensors. Figure 6b shows the representative dynamic response pattern
for a pulse train of 30 ppm CO at the operating temperature. Figure 6c unfolds the sensitivity
of CeO2 sensors as a function of concentration at 400 °C,
showing the increase in sensitivity as the analyte concentration increases.
The corresponding dynamic response patterns are provided in Figure S7. The response time of a gas sensor
to trigger an alarm and the recovery time, required for a sensor to
be ready for the next target analyte, are of paramount importance
for real-time application purposes in the sensor field. Conventionally,
the response time (τres) is defined as the time required
by the sensor to reach 90% of its saturation resistance value after
being exposed to the target analyte and the recovery time (τrec) is the time lag to attain its 90% baseline value after
the target analyte is withdrawn. Deploying the CeO2 sensors
under different concentrations of CO ranging from 10 to 30 ppm, the
results exhibit excellent response and recovery times of the sensors.
The response times (τres) of the sensors are 9, 10,
and 13 s under 10, 20, and 30 ppm CO, respectively, and the recovery
times (τrec) are 11, 12, and 14, respectively, under
the same series of concentrations (Figure 6d). The cross-sensitivity of the sensors
was checked against the most common interfering gases with higher
concentrations. Figure 7a reveals that 10-fold higher concentrations of formaldehyde, hydrogen
sulfide, and ammonia and 100 times higher concentration of a hydrocarbon
(n-butane) resulted in much lower sensitivity compared
to that of 30 ppm CO in air. In this article, the base resistance
of the sensors and their sensitivity toward CO were monitored for
a span of 15 months (Figure 7b,c respectively). During the entire tenure of 15 months,
the sensors show good stability of base resistance with a standard
deviation of less than 1 (Figure 7b) and an almost constant sensitivity was observed
with a standard deviation of less than 2 (Figure 7c). The high effective surface area of CeO2 nanospheres provides enhanced surface coverage of oxygen
adsorbates, and the surface catalytic properties of the CeO2 material promote the oxidation of CO. The abundant oxygen vacancies
of CeO2, high oxygen storage capacity, and facile transition
between its Ce3+ and Ce4+ oxidation states result
in enhanced sensitivity during CO sensing. According to the basic
n-type solid-state gas-sensing theory, oxygen molecules of air dissociatively
or nondissociatively adsorb on the metal oxide surface in a random
manner, resulting in trapping of electrons from the conduction band
and formation of charged oxygen molecular species like Oads2–, Oads–, and Oads2–. These adatoms are electrostatically
stabilized near the cations at the surface of the metal oxide. CO,
which is reducing in nature, reacts with these charged oxygen species
and, as a consequence, the trapped electrons are again free to the
conduction band, resulting in a drop in resistance. Reportedly, this
occurs in the temperature range of 100–500 °C, which is
usually the operating temperature of the sensors of this genre. Initially,
physisorption of CO takes place via dipole bonding to the metal-oxide–semiconductor
surface, removing the electrons from high oxygen vacancy, and a charge
transfer mechanism subsequently results in the formation of a chemical
bond with the semiconductor surface atoms, commonly known as chemisorption.
The facile monolayer adsorption of CO molecules (may be assigned from
adsorption isotherm, Figure 3) on the surface of a surface-active CeO2 sensor
plays a pivotal role in the staggering response time, 9 s.

(b) dynamic response characteristics of 30 ppm CO at 400 °C,

stability of the sensor base resistance and long-term stability of
the sensitivity under 30 ppm CO at 400 °C, respectively.

During the physical adsorption,
target gas molecules are attracted
to the sensor surface to form adsorption layers, and then, depending
on gas concentration, they may be multilayer or monolayer in nature.
The BET adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size distribution
(Figure 3) of the CeO2 sensing material lead to the high probability of formation
of monolayers across the sensor surface. The active sites of CeO2 escalate the response time. Additionally, the formation of
monolayer propagates the conductive charge transfer across the material,
promoting the same. The monolayer formation also favors the process
of desorption, resulting in a faster recovery time of the sensors
(Figure 6d). The above
observations suggest that the undoped CeO2 nanospheres
with high surface area are a good choice as a material for CO sensors
showing fast response and recovery features and appreciable stability
over a long period of time.

Conclusions
Highly
porous well-dispersed CeO2 nanospheres were synthesized
via the reverse micelle precipitation method. The undoped pristine
material was deployed for low-concentration (30–10 ppm) CO
gas sensing at an optimum operating temperature, and the sensors,
comprising the same, showed appreciable sensitivity with rapid response
and recovery times with significant selectivity as well. The LOD of
the ready-to-use sensors is down to 10 ppm with commendable sensitivity
of ∼43% and that too has the response time of less than 10
s. The sensor parameters of the materials are well corroborated to
the morphology, high surface area, and porosity of the material. Compared
with previously reported studies, this article enlightens the potential
of undoped pristine CeO2 nanomaterials in the development
of a CO gas sensor, opening a new direction toward the usage of bare
CeO2 in the gas-sensing filed.
