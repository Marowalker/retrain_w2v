Herein,
we report a novel type of smart graphene oxide nanocomposites
(MGO@PNB) with excellent magnetism and high thermosensitive ion-recognition
selectivity of lead ions (Pb2+). The MGO@PNB are fabricated
by immobilizing superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(NPs) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6 acrylamide) thermosensitive microgels (PNB) onto
graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets using a simple one-step solvothermal
method and mussel-inspired polydopamine chemistry. The PNB are composed
of cross-linked poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)
chains with numerous appended 18-crown-6 units. The 18-crown-6 units
serve as hosts that can selectively recognize and capture Pb2+ from aqueous solution, and the PNIPAM chains act as a microenvironmental
actuator for the inclusion constants of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ host–guest complexes. The loaded Fe3O4 NPs endow the MGO@PNB with convenient magnetic separability. The
fabricated MGO@PNB demonstrate remarkably high ion-recognition selectivity
of Pb2+ among the coexisting metal ions because of the
formation of stable 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes.
Most interestingly, the MGO@PNB show excellent thermosensitive adsorption
ability toward Pb2+ due to the incorporation of PNIPAM
functional chains on the GO. Further thermodynamic studies indicate
that the adsorption of Pb2+ onto the MGO@PNB is a spontaneous
and endothermic process. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm data
can be well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and
the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Most importantly, the Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB can be more easily regenerated by alternatively
washing with hot/cold water than the commonly used regeneration methods.
Such multifunctional graphene oxide nanocomposites could be used for
specific recognition and removal of Pb2+ from water environment.

1 Introduction
Lead
is one of the most common heavy metals, which is widely used
in modern industries, including storage batteries, painting pigments,
ammunitions, textiles and steels, etc.1−3 Lead ions (Pb2+) are usually delivered in soil and water body along with industrial
wastewater and can accumulate in the human body through food chains
or drinking water, thus causing serious effects on human health and
environment.4−7 Even a very low level of lead intake can bring about permanent damage
to the central nerve system, immune system, brain, and kidneys,1−7 especially to children’s intellectual development.8−10 Therefore, effective recognition and removal of Pb2+ from
aqueous environment is of vital importance, and there is a great scientific
significance for water treatment.1 To date,
a variety of technologies have been developed to identify and remove
Pb2+ from water environment, such as precipitation, ion
exchange, solvent extraction, membrane process, and adsorption.3,11−18 By contrast, adsorption is a competitive approach because of its
easy operation, high efficiency, and low cost.3,12−14,19−22 The key of this technology is to develop high-performance adsorbents.
Traditional adsorbents for Pb2+ recognition and removal
have some drawbacks, such as lack of selectivity and sensitivity,
tedious operational process, and low efficiency, which have restricted
their wide applications. Therefore, to develop high-performance adsorbent
materials for specific recognition and removal of Pb2+ from
water environment is highly desired.

Various kinds of functional
materials, including hydrogel-based
devices, gating membranes, and porous nanomaterials, have been recently
developed for specific recognition and removal of Pb2+ from
water.11,23−28 Among those materials, 18-crown-6, possessing remarkably high selectivity
and sensitivity toward Pb2+ by forming stable 1:1 (18-crown-6/Pb2+) inclusion complexes, provides a novel strategy to specifically
discriminate and remove Pb2+ from aqueous solution.11,26−30 For example, novel Pb2+-imprinted crown ether (Pb(II)-IIP)
particles were synthesized by using Pb2+ as template and
4-vinylbenzo-18-crown-6 as a functional monomer to specifically recognize
and remove Pb2+ from environmental water.26 Several Pb2+-responsive smart materials were
also developed to detect and remove Pb2+ from aqueous solution
by incorporating 18-crown-6 units into poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) polymers.11,27,28,31 PNIPAM, a well-known thermosensitive polymer,
can experience dramatic swelling/shrinking conformational changes
as environmental temperature is changed across its lower critical
solution temperature (LCST) around 32 °C. More importantly, those
Pb2+-responsive smart materials can be facilely regenerated
by raising the ambient temperature above the LCST of PNIPAM chains,
which results in the desorption of Pb2+ from the cavity
of crown ether. Although those crown ether-based smart materials can
selectively identify and remove Pb2+ from aqueous solution,
most of these processes are sophisticated and have low efficiency.
Magnetic graphene oxide (MGO) typically obtained by depositing some
superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs)
onto the graphene oxide (GO)32−34 is an excellent adsorption material
due to its large specific surface area, high stability, abundant oxygen-containing
functional groups on the surface, and convenient magnetic separability.35−43 But it cannot be utilized in specific recognition and removal of
Pb2+ from aqueous environment because of the lack of ion-recognized
sites on the surface, which limits its practical applications to some
extent. Incorporating some smart materials, such as 18-crown-6 with
high ion-recognition selectivity44 and
PNIPAM with excellent thermosensitivity, into MGO to fabricate smart
nanocomposites could address the above-mentioned problems.

Herein,
we report a novel type of smart graphene oxide nanocomposites
(MGO@PNB) with excellent magnetism and highly thermoresponsive ion-recognition
selectivity of Pb2+ based on the host–guest interactions
of 18-crown-6 and Pb2+. The MGO@PNB are fabricated by immobilizing
superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6
acrylamide) thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6 acrylamide) (PNB) microgels onto the
graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets using the simple one-step solvothermal
method and mussel-inspired polydopamine chemistry. The PNB are composed
of cross-linked PNIPAM chains with numerous appended 18-crown-6 units,
which serve as host receptors to specifically recognize and capture
Pb2+ from aqueous solution. The PNIPAM chains act as a
microenvironmental actuator for the inclusion constants of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes. The proposed concept of the thermosensitive adsorption
and separation of Pb2+ from aqueous solution by MGO@PNB
is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. When Pb2+ ions appear in aqueous solution,
the pendent 18-crown-6 units can capture them by forming stable charged
18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes. This will cause the volume phase-transition
temperature (VPTT) of PNB to shift positively from a low-temperature
VPTT1 to a higher-temperature VPTT2 because
of the enhancement of hydrophilicity of the polymer chains and the
repulsion among the charged 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes (Figure 1a).11,28,44 As the operating temperature
(T2) is set between VPTT1 and
VPTT2, the PNB isothermally change from a shrunken state
to a swollen one by recognizing Pb2+ in aqueous solution.
As a result, Pb2+ are easily captured by 18-crown-6 units
and removed from the water as the ambient temperature is kept at a
certain value below VPTT2 (Figure 1b,c). After the complexes of 18-crown-6 and
the captured Pb2+ reach saturation on the MGO@PNB, the
Pb2+-recognized MGO@PNB can be easily isolated from water
under an external magnet (Figure 1c,d). Afterward, the PNB become shrunken and hydrophobic
as the operating temperature is increased to T3 above the VPTT2. This causes the desorption of
Pb2+ from the 18-crown-6 units because of the thermo-induced
reduction in inclusion constants between 18-crown-6 and the captured
Pb2+ (Figure 1e).11,45,46 That is to
say, the recognition and separation of Pb2+ from the aqueous
solution and the regeneration of MGO@PNB can be easily achieved by
simply varying the operating temperature and applying an external
magnetic field (Figure 1f).

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the thermosensitive adsorption and separation
of Pb2+ from aqueous solution by MGO@PNB. (a) Pendent 18-crown-6
units on the PNB microgels can capture Pb2+ ions by forming
stable charged 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes, which cause the
volume phase-transition temperature (VPTT) of PNB to shift positively
from a low-temperature VPTT1 to a higher-temperature VPTT2 because of the enhancement of hydrophilicity of the polymer
chains and the repulsion among the charged 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes. (b, c) As the operating temperature (T2) is set between VPTT1 and VPTT2, the PNB isothermally change from a shrunken state to a swollen
one by recognizing Pb2+ in aqueous solution. As a result,
Pb2+ are easily captured by 18-crown-6 units and removed
from the water as the ambient temperature is kept at a certain value
below VPTT2. (d) After the complexes of 18-crown-6 and
the captured Pb2+ reach saturation on the MGO@PNB, the
Pb2+-recognized MGO@PNB can be easily isolated from water
under an external magnet. (e) PNB become shrunken and hydrophobic
as the operating temperature is increased to T3 above the VPTT2. This causes the desorption of
Pb2+ from the 18-crown-6 units because of the thermo-induced
reduction in inclusion constants between 18-crown-6 and the captured
Pb2+. (f) Separation of Pb2+ from the aqueous
solution and the regeneration of MGO@PNB can be achieved by simply
varying the operating temperature and applying an external magnetic
field.

The detailed fabrication process
of MGO@PNB is shown in Figure 2. First, MGO are
prepared by a versatile one-step solvothermal method (Figure 2a).47−50 Then, PNB are synthesized by
a simple precipitation copolymerization method using N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and acrylamide-modified benzo-18-crown-6
(B18C6Am) as the functional monomers (Figure 2b).51 The PNB
are immobilized onto the MGO via self-polymerization of bio-adhesive
dopamine (DA) at a weak alkaline condition (pH 8.5, Figure 2c), finally causing the formation
of MGO@PNB.52−56 Since DA is a biomolecule with plentiful catechol and amine functional
groups and can easily self-polymerize into polydopamine (PDA) under
weak alkaline conditions, these multifunctional PDA layers endow strong
adhesion onto a wide range of substrates. The unique property of PDA
provides an effective strategy to immobilize PNB onto the MGO.52−56 Compared to the current technologies, the suggested separation process
by using such smart graphene nanocomposites is facilely operated and
environmentally friendly, which shows great potentials in specific
recognition and removal of Pb2+ from water environment.

the MGO via self-polymerization of bio-adhesive dopamine (DA) at a

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Materials
Characterizations
The typical
TEM images of MGO and MGO@PNB are shown in Figure 3a,b. Compared to the MGO, the MGO@PNB show
a dramatically different microstructure. They have a crumpled and
flakelike structure, and the GO nanosheets are loaded with black Fe3O4 NPs with an average size of about 80 nm, which
endows the MGO@PNB with excellent magnetic separability. After depositing
of PNB onto the MGO, grayish PNB microgels with good sphericity and
monodispersity are observed on the MGO. The morphological and microstructural
changes of nanocomposites indicate the successful immobilization of
PNB onto the MGO, thus resulting in the formation of MGO@PNB.

images of MGO (a) and MGO@PNB (b). (c) Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of MGO, MGO@PNB, and PNB. (d) TG curves of
MGO and MGO@PNB. (e) Magnetization hysteresis loops of MGO and MGO@PNB
at room temperature. The insets show the dispersion (a′) and
separation (b′) behaviors of MGO@PNB in the absence and presence
of an external magnetic field in water.

The successful fabrication of MGO@PNB is also confirmed by
FT-IR
spectroscopy. Figure 3c shows the FT-IR spectra of MGO, MGO@PNB, and PNB. The characteristic
peaks of GO at 1043 cm–1 for the C–O–C
stretching vibration in epoxy group and at 1724 cm–1 for the C=O stretching vibration of −COOH groups are
all found in the FT-IR spectrum of MGO. Moreover, the characteristic
peaks at 592 cm–1 for the Fe–O stretching
vibration, the asymmetric stretching vibrations of −SO3– groups at 1213 cm–1,
and the C=O asymmetric stretching vibrations of COO– in PSSMA at 1407 and 1581 cm–1 are also observed,
indicating a successful anchoring of Fe3O4 NPs
and PSSMA molecules onto the GO.47−50 After immobilizing PNB onto the
MGO, the typical double peaks at 1363 and 1392 cm–1 for isopropyl group and the characteristic peak of C=O stretching
vibrations at 1648 cm–1 from PNIPAM are all found
in the FT-IR spectra of MGO@PNB.51 Meanwhile,
the peaks of benzo-18-crown-6, including a strong peak at 1521 cm–1 (shoulder peak) for C=C skeletal stretching
vibration in the phenyl ring, a peak at 1230 cm–1 for C–O asymmetric stretching vibration in Ar–O–R
groups,51 and a peak at 1128 cm–1 for C–O symmetric stretching vibration in R–O–R
groups, are also observed in the FT-IR spectra of MGO@PNB, indicating
the successful fabrication of MGO@PNB.

The thermal properties
of MGO and MGO@PNB are shown in Figure 3d. For MGO, the first
weight loss at temperature below about 350 °C is attributed to
the evaporation of the physically adsorbed water onto the MGO, and
the second mass loss from 350 to 600 °C is due to the decomposition
of −COOH, −OH, and C–O–C groups from GO
and PSSMA molecules covalently bound onto the MGO.50 Compared to the TG curve of MGO, the MGO@PNB demonstrate
a weight loss of 44.80 wt % due to the decomposition of PNB and PDA
thin layer onto the MGO. The immobilization amount of PNB onto the
MGO is calculated to be about 295.1 mg/g on the basis of the TGA results,
which shows again the successful fabrication of MGO@PNB.

The
loaded Fe3O4 NPs onto the MGO@PNB enable
the functional nanocomposites with convenient magnetic separability
from contaminated aqueous solution. The magnetization hysteresis loops
of the MGO and MGO@PNB at room temperature are shown in Figure 3e. The hysteresis and coercivity
are almost undetectable when the applied magnetic field is removed,
indicating high superparamagnetism of the MGO and MGO@PNB. Therefore,
these functional nanocomposites will not aggregate by retaining any
magnetism, and will be redispersed rapidly after removing the external
magnet (Figure 3a′,
inset). The magnetization saturation (Ms) values of the MGO and MGO@PNB are 34.9 and 15.9 emu/g, respectively.
The obvious decrease of the Ms value is
due to the existence of nonmagnetic organic substances, including
PNB and PDA layer on the MGO. However, the MGO@PNB still demonstrate
excellent magnetic responsiveness and can be completely isolated from
the aqueous solution under an external magnetic field within 2 min,
and then redispersed in water by slight shaking (Figure 3b′, inset). Such excellent
magnetism of the MGO@PNB facilitates good recycling of the functional
nanocomposites from water.

2.2 Theremoresponsive Property
and Pb2+-Recognized Responsive Behaviors of PNB
The thermosensitive
shrunken behaviors of PNB microgels in water and Pb2+ aqueous
solution (20 mmol/L) are shown in Figure 4. As expected, PNB in both water and Pb2+ aqueous solution undergo rapid size decrease as the environmental
temperature is varied across a corresponding temperature region due
to the excellent thermosensitivity of PNIPAM chains. The volume phase-transition
temperature (VPTT) of PNB in water is around 33 °C, consistent
with the VPTT of pure PNIPAM microgels (∼32 °C).51 By contrast, the hydrodynamic diameters of PNB
decrease dramatically at higher temperatures in Pb2+ aqueous
solution upon increasing the temperature. The VPTT of PNB in Pb2+ aqueous solution shifts obviously to a higher temperature
(∼41 °C) compared to that in water, showing an evident
Pb2+-recognized responsive property. Such a dramatically
positive shift of VPTT for PNB in Pb2+ aqueous solution
is due to the enhancement of hydrophilicity of the copolymer and the
repulsion interactions among the charged 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes.11,28,57 That is to say, PNB can isothermally change from a shrunken state
to a swollen one in the presence of Pb2+ as the ambient
temperature is set at a certain value between the two VPTTs of microgels
in water and Pb2+ aqueous solution.

shrunken behaviors of PNB in water and 20
mmol/L Pb2+ aqueous solution.

2.3 Thermosensitive Adsorption and Thermodynamic
Study of Pb2+ by MGO@PNB
As observed in Figure 4, the PNB microgels
immobilized onto the MGO@PNB exhibit dramatically thermosensitive
volume phase changes in Pb2+ aqueous solutions as the environmental
operating temperature is varied across its VPTT due to the excellent
thermosensitivity of PNIPAM chains. Therefore, verification of the
Pb2+ adsorption and the regeneration of functional nanocomposites
can be easily achieved by simply changing the operating temperature,
and the thermosensitive adsorption of Pb2+ onto the MGO@PNB
is investigated at three typical temperatures (25, 45, and 65 °C)
and the results are shown in Figure 5a. The equilibrium adsorption of Pb2+ onto
the MGO@PNB at 25 °C (lower than the VPTT value of PNB) is much
higher than that at 45 °C (slightly higher than the VPTT value
of PNB) and 65 °C (higher than the VPTT value of PNB). This indicates
that the thermosensitivity of PNIPAM chains onto the MGO@PNB affects
the interactions between the 18-crown-6 units and Pb2+.
Such dramatic thermo-induced reduction in adsorption capacities of
Pb2+ onto the MGO@PNB is mainly due to the decrease of
the inclusion constant of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes as
the environmental operating temperature is increased.11,45,46,58 As the environmental operating temperature is set at 25 °C,
the PNIPAM chains are swollen and the inclusion constants of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes are large, which is beneficial for 18-crown-6
units to capture Pb2+ from aqueous solution and form stable
18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes, thus leading to higher
adsorption capacities of MGO@PNB toward Pb2+. However,
as the environmental operating temperature is increased above the
VPTT value of PNB, the PNIPAM chains are shrunken and the inclusion
constants of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes decrease. As a result,
part of captured Pb2+ release from the cavities of 18-crown-6
units, causing decrease of adsorption capacities of Pb2+. Therefore, the MGO@PNB can be conveniently regenerated by simply
raising the environmental temperature.

MGO@PN, and MGO@PNB at 25, 45, and 65 °C. van’t Hoff plots
for adsorption of Pb2+ onto the MGO (b), MGO@PN (c), and
MGO@PNB (d). The initial concentration of Pb2+ and the
dosage of adsorbents were 50 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively.

By contrast, the equilibrium adsorption capacities
of Pb2+ onto MGO@PN and MGO at 25 °C are much lower
than those of MGO@PNB
since MGO@PN and MGO cannot form 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion
complexes with Pb2+ due to the absence of crown ether units.
Moreover, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of Pb2+ onto
the MGO at 25 °C is almost the same as that at 45 and 65 °C,
showing no thermosensitive adsorption ability of MGO toward Pb2+, while the equilibrium adsorption capacity of Pb2+ onto the MGO@PN at 25 °C is slightly higher than those at 45
and 65 °C because of the presence of thermosensitive PNIPAM chains
onto the MGO@PN.

To further investigate the adsorption mechanisms
of Pb2+ onto the functional nanocomposites, the thermodynamic
parameters
for the adsorption process, such as free-energy change (ΔG), enthalpy change (ΔH), and entropy
change (ΔS), which provide in-depth information
about internal energy changes that are associated with adsorption,
were calculated by the following van’t Hoff equations:59−61 1   2  where KL is the
Langmuir constant, R is the gas constant (8.314 J/(mol
K)), and T is the temperature (K). The enthalpy change
is obtained by calculating the slope of a plot of ln KL versus T–1 (Figure 5b–d),
and the thermodynamic parameters obtained at three different temperatures
are listed in Table 1. The negative values of ΔG indicate that
the adsorption processes of Pb2+ onto these functional
nanocomposites are feasible and spontaneous.59−61 The more negative
value of ΔG with the decrease of temperature
indicates that lower temperature would be beneficial for the adsorption.
The negative values of slope or the positive values of ΔH suggest the endothermic adsorption processes, and the
positive values of ΔS reflect the increased
randomness at the solid–liquid interface during the adsorption
of Pb2+ onto those functional nanocomposites.59−61

2.4 Thermosensitive Ion-Recognition Selectivity
of MGO@PNB
To evaluate the ion-recognition selectivity of
MGO@PNB toward specific metal ions, the Pb2+ adsorption
experiments at different temperatures in mixed metal ions solutions
as a simulate-contaminated wastewater containing some common coexisting
ions, such as Pb2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+, are investigated
and the results are shown in Figure 6. The adsorption ability of MGO@PNB toward Pb2+ at 25 °C is much higher than that at 45 and 65 °C. This
is due to that a much larger inclusion constant of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes benefited from the swollen PNIPAM chains while
the operating temperature (25 °C) is lower than the VPTT value
of PNB, which is consistent with the results in Figure 5a. Most interestingly, the MGO@PNB with 18-crown-6
units exhibit much higher adsorption ability toward Pb2+, and the equilibrium adsorption capacity of Pb2+ at 25
°C is almost 7 times higher than that of the other metal ions.
The significant difference in the adsorption capacities of different
metal ions onto the MGO@PNB is mainly due to the selective formation
of crown-ether/metal-ion inclusion complexes between 18-crown-6 units
and the suitable metal ions, which is dominated by the size/shape
fitting or matching effects between the host (crown ether receptor)
and the guest (metal ions).44,46,57,62 MGO@PNB are capable of specifically
and selectively capturing Pb2+ from the mixed metal-ion
solutions to form stable 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes.
This remarkably increases the adsorption capacity of MGO@PNB toward
Pb2+.11,28,44,57 By contrast, the metal ions, such as Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and
Cd2+, cannot form inclusion complexes with 18-crown-6 units
because of unfit or unmatched size/shape,44,57 thus resulting in small adsorption capacities of Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ onto the MGO@PNB. Therefore, these metal ions cannot be effectively
recognized and removed by MGO@PNB. As a comparison, MGO and MGO@PN
without 18-crown-6 units demonstrate low adsorption abilities toward
all of the metal ions at all setting temperatures. The adsorption
capacities are much lower than that of MGO@PNB because of no crown
ether units on the MGO to form complexes with metal ions. The metal
ions in solutions can only interact with −COO– groups on the MGO via electrostatic attractions, thus exhibiting
very low adsorption ability toward metal ions.63

(a), MGO@PN (b), and MGO@PNB (c) in mixed metal-ion solutions containing
Pb2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ at different temperatures.
The initial concentration of these metal ions and the dosage of functional
nanocomposites were 25 and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively.

2.5 Effect of Contact Time
and Adsorption Kinetics
Since adsorption kinetics that describes
the solute uptake rate
and the mechanism of adsorption is one of the important characteristics
defining the adsorption efficiency and contact time of the adsorption
interaction, the effect of contact time on the adsorption of Pb2+ onto MGO and MGO@PNB was studied. As is shown in Figure 7, the adsorption
capacities of Pb2+ onto both MGO and MGO@PNB increase quickly
with increasing contact time within the first 4 min and then rise
slowly until the adsorption reaches equilibrium after 20 min, suggesting
that the prepared MGO@PNB have rapid adsorption abilities toward Pb2+. The initial high adsorption rate may be ascribed to the
abundant active sites on the particle surface. On the basis of the
above result, a contact time of 20 min was adopted for the subsequent
adsorption studies.

Figure 7 Effect of contact time on adsorption of Pb2+ onto MGO
and MGO@PNB. The initial concentration of Pb2+ and the
dosage of functional nanocomposites were 50 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively.

To further investigate the mechanism
of the adsorption processes,
the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are used to
fit the experimental data.18,64,65 These two kinetic models can be expressed in linear forms as follows: 3   4  where qe and qt are the adsorption capacities
of Pb2+ at equilibrium state and at any time t, respectively,
and k1 and k2 represent the rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
models, respectively. The fitting of the pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order
models can be checked by plotting ln(qe – qt) against t and t/qt against t (Supporting Information Figure S1) by the linear regression analysis, respectively. And the values
of qe and rate constants (k1 and k2) can be determined
from the intercept and slope of the linear plots. The corresponding
adsorption kinetic parameters of these two kinetic models, including
correlation coefficients (R2), k1, k2, and the calculated qe,cal values, are displayed in Table 2. It can be observed that the qe,cal value of the MGO@PNB calculated through
the pseudo-second-order model (11.60 mg/g) is much closer to the experimental qe (11.67 mg/g). Besides, R2 (0.9978) of the pseudo-second-order model for MGO@PNB is
slightly higher than that of the pseudo-first-order model (0.9932),
indicating that the adsorption process follows the pseudo-second-order
model rather than the pseudo-first-order model. Therefore, it can
be deduced that the Pb2+ adsorption onto the MGO@PNB involves
all of the steps of adsorption, including external film diffusion,
chemisorption, and internal particle diffusion.18,64,65 Furthermore, the chemisorption between the
metal ions and binding sites of adsorbent, which is the main rate-limiting
factor and controlled by the supramolecular host–guest interaction
of 18-crown-6 toward Pb2+ in this system, dominates the
Pb2+ adsorption process of MGO@PNB.27,63

2.6 Effect of Initial Ion Concentrations and Adsorption
Isotherms
Figure 8 shows the effect of initial ion concentrations on the adsorption
of Pb2+ onto MGO and MGO@PNB. The Pb2+ adsorption
are highly dependent on the initial ion concentrations and increase
with increasing initial Pb2+ concentrations due to excessive
active sites available on the adsorbent, which can interact with the
relatively insufficient Pb2+ ions in solution. Because
the Pb2+ ions in bulk solution are surplus, only parts
of them can interact with finite active sites on the adsorbent, thus
causing a flat increase until arriving at saturation adsorption at
higher ion concentrations. By contrast, the adsorption capacity of
Pb2+ onto the MGO is much lower than that of MGO@PNB due
to the absence of crown ether units, leading to the inability to form
stable 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes.

concentration on the adsorption of Pb2+ onto MGO and MGO@PNB.
The dosage of functional nanocomposites
was 1.5 mg/mL, and the operation temperature was 25 °C.

Figure 9 Adsorption isotherms of Pb2+ by MGO
and MGO@PNB. The
dosage of nanocomposites was 1.5 mg/mL, and the operation temperature
was 25 °C.

The equilibrium adsorption
isotherm can provide some important
information about the surface properties of adsorbents, the adsorption
behaviors, and the design of adsorption systems, which reflects the
relationship between the amount of adsorbate uptaken by the adsorbents
and the concentration of adsorbate remaining in solution when the
adsorption process reaches equilibrium.18,66Figure 9 shows the adsorption isotherms
of Pb2+ by MGO and MGO@PNB. The adsorption capacities of
Pb2+ onto MGO and MGO@PNB increase initially and then gradually
reach saturation adsorption. To make a further investigation on both
the adsorption mechanism and affinity of the adsorbent, the experimental
equilibrium data of Pb2+ adsorption onto MGO and MGO@PNB
at pH 5.0 and 25 °C are fitted by the Langmuir and Freundlich
isotherm models.18,66 The Langmuir isotherm model is
often applicable that the adsorption is localized on a monolayer and
occurs on a homogeneous surface with all of the adsorption sites having
equal adsorbate affinity, whereas the Freundlich isotherm model presumes
that the multilayer of the adsorption process occurs on a heterogeneous
adsorption surface.18,66 These two isotherm models can
be expressed in linear forms by the following equations 5   6  where qe and qm (mg/g) are the equilibrium
and maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbent, respectively; Ce (mg/L) is the equilibrium solution concentration
of Pb2+; KL (L/mg) represents
the Langmuir constant, which relates to the affinity of the binding
sites; and KF and n are
the Freundlich constants that represent the adsorption capacity and
adsorption intensity, respectively. On the basis of the above equations,
the values of qm and KL for the Langmuir model can be determined from the slope
and intercept of the linear plot of Ce/qe versus Ce, whereas the values of KF and 1/n for the Freundlich model can be determined from the slope
and intercept of the linear plot of ln qe versus ln Ce (Supporting
Information Figure S2). The relevant parameters
calculated from the Langmuir and Freundlich models are listed in Table 3. The correlation
coefficients of MGO@PNB (R2 = 0.9893)
and MGO (R2 = 0.9945) obtained from the
Langmuir isotherm model are very close to 1 and much higher than those
from the Freundlich isotherm model, indicating that the Langmuir isotherm
fits better with the experimental adsorption data. Besides, the maximum
monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) values
for MGO@PNB and MGO calculated from the Langmuir isotherm are 11.76
and 3.66 mg/g, respectively, which are all in accordance with the
experimental values (11.82 and 3.70 mg/g, respectively). This suggests
again that the Pb2+ adsorption onto MGO@PNB and MGO is
a monolayer adsorption and follows the Langmuir isotherm.

 	Langmuir model	Freundlich model	
adsorbent	qmax (mg/g)	KL (L/mg)	RL	R2	n	KF	R2	
MGO	3.66	0.199	0.201–0.334	0.9954	3.786	1.350	0.7879	
MGO@PNB	11.76	0.149	0.283–0.441	0.9893	2.800	3.256	0.7966	
Moreover,
the essential feature of the Langmuir isotherm can be
expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant separation factor (RL), which is used to evaluate the feasibility
of adsorption onto an adsorbent.59 The RL can be calculated by the following equation: 7  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial ion concentrations in aqueous solution and KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant. The value
of RL indicates the type of the isotherm
to be unfavorable (RL > 1), linear
(RL = 1), favorable (0 < RL < 1), or irreversible (RL = 0).59 The RL values of Pb2+ adsorption onto MGO@PNB and MGO ranged
from 0.201 to 0.441, indicating that the Pb2+ adsorption
onto MGO@PNB and MGO is a favorable process.

2.7 Regeneration
of MGO@PNB
The regeneration
and recycling of an adsorbent is very important for its practical
applications. As shown in Figure 3e, the Fe3O4 NPs loaded on the
MGO@PNB endow them with convenient separability from aqueous solution
under an external magnetic field. Thus, the regeneration of Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB can be easily implemented by using a magnet
and then flushing alternatively with hot water (70 °C) and cold
water (25 °C). The Pb2+ adsorption/desorption from
the MGO@PNB are performed for six successive cycles, and the results
are shown in Figure 10. The desorption capacities of Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB are
slightly lower than the adsorption capacities for each cycle. This
is due to that some parts of Pb2+ adsorbed on the MGO@PNB
cannot desorb from the cavities of crown ether during the regeneration
process and the amount of MGO@PNB would also incur loss during the
washing process. However, the Pb2+ adsorption capacities
of MGO@PNB at 25 °C only lose about 20% after six successive
adsorption/desorption cycles, indicating that the as-fabricated MGO@PNB
have excellent recyclability. Compared to the commonly used regeneration
methods using strong acid and/or strong base or inorganic salt solutions
through repeated ultrasonication,16,18−22,67−69 the proposed
strategy for the regeneration of MGO@PNB herein is not only much simpler
but also more environmentally friendly.

Figure 10 Adsorption and desorption
ability of MGO@PNB toward Pb2+ in six successive cycles.
The initial Pb2+ concentration
and the dosage of nanocomposites were 50 and 1.5 mg/mL, respectively.

We also compare the adsorption
performances of the MGO@PNB toward
Pb2+ with the traditional adsorbents reported recently,16,18−22,67 and the results are listed in Table 4. Although those traditional
adsorbents show higher adsorption capacities for single-lead ion system
than the MGO@PNB developed in this work, they have some evident drawbacks,
such as lack of ion selectivity and sensitivity of Pb2+, operational complexity, and environmental unfriendliness upon regenerating
those adsorbents. This limits the practical applications of these
materials to some degree. By contrast, the as-prepared MGO@PNB demonstrate
highly thermosensitive ion-recognition selectivity of Pb2+ among the coexisting metal ions. Most importantly, the Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB can be easily regenerated by alternatively washing
with hot/cold water instead of using strong acids, strong bases, and/or
inorganic salt solutions,16,18−22,67 which is much simpler and environmentally
friendly compared to the commonly regenerated techniques of adsorbents.
And the low adsorption capacity of MGO@PNB toward Pb2+ is
because the incorporation amount of crown ether units on the functional
graphene nanocomposites is not high. Further studies on improving
the adsorption capacity of Pb2+ are being carried out by
our group.

Besides, to further
investigate the chemical stability of the MGO@PNB,
the degree of iron leaching into the aqueous solution was measured
by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after each
adsorption/regeneration process mentioned above.70 The measured and calculated values of iron leaching from
MGO@PNB are listed in Table 5. The theoretical value is calculated to be ≤11.20
μg/L since the content of iron impurity is ≤0.00002%
for HNO3, which is used to adjust the pH value of aqueous
solutions, whereas the measured value in aqueous solution after each
regeneration cycle is in the range of 8.11–10.52 μg/L,
indicating the excellent chemical stability of the MGO@PNB. All of
those results indicate that the developed MGO@PNB herein can be used
for specific recognition and removal of Pb2+ from aqueous
environment.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel type of smart graphene oxide nanocomposites
(MGO@PNB) with excellent magnetism and highly thermosensitive ion-recognition
selectivity of Pb2+ has been successfully developed by
immobilizing superparamagnetic Fe3O4 NPs and
poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-benzo-18-crown-6
acrylamide) thermosensitive microgels (PNB) onto the GO using simple
one-step solvothermal method and mussel-inspired polydopamine chemistry.
The PNB are composed of cross-linked PNIPAM chains with numerous appended
18-crown-6 units. The 18-crown-6 units can selectively recognize and
capture Pb2+ in aqueous solution, and the PNIPAM chains
serve as a microenvironmental actuator for the inclusion constants
of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes. The loaded Fe3O4 NPs endow the MGO@PNB with convenient magnetic separability.
The resulted MGO@PNB demonstrate high ion-recognition selectivity
of Pb2+ among the coexisting metal ions, including Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+, by forming stable 18-crown-6/Pb2+ inclusion complexes and the excellent thermosensitive adsorption
ability toward Pb2+ due to the incorporation of PNIPAM
functional chains on the MGO. The adsorption process is spontaneous
and endothermic and fits well with the pseudo-second-order model and
the Langmuir isotherm model. Most importantly, the Pb2+-loaded MGO@PNB can be easily regenerated by alternatively washing
with hot/cold water. Such multifunctional graphene nanocomposites
developed herein have great potentials in specific recognition and
removal of Pb2+ from water environment.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
N-Isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAM) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry and purified by
recrystallization with a mixture of hexane and acetone (50/50, v/v).
Benzo-18-crown-6 acrylamide (B18C6Am) was synthesized from 4-nitro-benzo-18-crown-6
(NB18C6, Sigma-Aldrich) according to ref (26). Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared from graphite
powders (325 mesh, Qingdao Huatai Lubricating & Sealing Tech.
Co., Ltd.) according to refs47−50. Poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid, SS/MA = 3:1) sodium salt (PSSMA, Mw =20 000), tris(hydroxymethyl) methylaminomethane
(THAM), and dopamine hydrochloride (DA) were purchased from Aladdin
Chemicals. 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), N,N′-methylenediacrylamide
(MBA), sodium acetate (NaAc), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were
obtained from Chengdu Kelong Chemicals, and AIBN was recrystallized
with ethanol before use. All other chemicals were of analytical grade
and used as received. Deionized water (18.2 MΩ, 25 °C)
from a Milli-Q plus purification system (Millipore) was used throughout
the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of MGO@PNB
MGO@PNB were
fabricated by immobilizing PNB onto MGO using the adhesion property
of DA under weak alkaline condition (pH = 8.5).52−55 MGO and PNB were synthesized
according to refs47−51. The detailed synthesis process is shown in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Characterizations
The morphologies
and microstructures of functional nanocomposites were observed by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan) at an
accelerating voltage of 120 kV. Samples dispersed at an appropriate
concentration were dropped onto a carbon-coated Cu grid, followed
by air drying. The chemical structures and compositions of functional
nanocomposites were characterized by a Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectrometer (IR 200, Thermo Nicolet). The hydrodynamic sizes
of PNB were tested by a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument
(Zetasizer Nano-ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK) with a scattering angle
of 90°. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the functional nanocomposites
was performed on a Mettler TGA/SDTA851e° (Switzerland) at a heating
rate of 5 °C/min from 20 to 650 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere.
The magnetism of functional nanocomposites was measured by a vibrating
sample magnetometer on a model 6000 physical property measurement
system (Quantum Design). The stabilities of functional nanocomposites
during adsorption processes were measured using inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher).

4.4 Adsorption Experiments
To study the
thermosensitive adsorption behaviors and the adsorption thermodynamics
of MGO@PNB toward metal ions, three typical operating temperatures,
including 25 °C (lower than the VPTT of PNB), 45 °C (slightly
higher than the VPTT of PNB), and 65 °C (higher than the VPTT
of PNB), were chosen as the investigated temperatures. In detail,
15 mg of MGO@PNB (or MGO) was added in the preheated vials contained
10 mL of Pb2+ solutions at 25 °C. The initial Pb2+ concentration was 50 mg/L, and the pH values were adjusted
to 5.0 with a negligible volume of 10 wt % HNO3. Then,
the vials were sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker at different
temperatures (25, 45, and 65 °C) and shaken under 150 rpm for
20 min to ensure reaching adsorption equilibrium. After that, the
metal ions-loaded MGO@PNB were separated with a magnet and the supernatant
was drawn out and filtrated with a 0.22 μm micropore membrane
to ensure the safe use of subsequent analytical instrument. The Pb2+ concentrations before and after interaction with functional
nanocomposites were analyzed by ICP-MS. Besides, the blank aqueous
solutions without adding MGO@PNB were also conducted at each stage
of the experiment.

The ion selectivity of MGO@PNB was investigated
by batch adsorption experiments at a fixed pH value in mixtures of
metal ions containing Pb2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+. The initial
concentrations of these metal ions and pH values in aqueous solutions
were all 25 mg/L and 5.0, respectively. Then, 20 mg of MGO@PNB was
added in vials that contained 10 mL of the aforementioned metal ions
solutions. The vials were sealed and vibrated in a thermostatic shaker
under 150 rpm at different temperatures (25, 45, and 65 °C) for
20 min, and the concentrations of Pb2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Cd2+ before and after interaction with the functional nanocomposites
were measured with ICP-MS. To confirm that the ion selectivity of
the MGO@PNB toward Pb2+ was due to the formation of 18-crown-6/Pb2+ complexes, the PNB-free MGO and the crown ether units-free
MGO@PN were used to interact with the metal ions solutions with the
same procedure as described above.

The adsorption kinetics were
studied by batch adsorption experiments
with 15 mg of MGO@PNB and an initial Pb2+ concentration
of 50 mg/L at 25 °C and pH 5.0 to evaluate the minimum contact
time required for reaching adsorption equilibrium. Aqueous samples
after interaction with functional nanocomposites were measured at
determined time intervals. To study the effect of initial ion concentrations
on the adsorption of Pb2+, 15 mg of MGO@PNB was added in
vials that contained 10 mL of Pb2+ solutions with different
concentrations ranging from 0 to 70 mg/L. To assess the regeneration
performance of the MGO@PNB, desorption experiments were carried out
by increasing the operating temperature and washing with deionized
water in a thermostatic shaker for 10 h; then, the magnetically collected
MGO@PNB were washed alternately with hot/cold water several times,
and then used for the next cycle. The adsorption/desorption capacities
of Pb2+ were tested in the same way as described above.

The equilibrium adsorption capacities of functional nanocomposites
toward metal ions (qe, mg/g) were calculated
from the following equation: 8  where C0 and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentrations
(mg/L) of Pb2+ in solution, respectively; qe is the amount of Pb2+ adsorbed onto the MGO@PNB
(mg/g) after equilibrium, V is the volume of metal-ion
solutions (L), and m is the mass of functional nanocomposites
(g). All of the adsorption experiments were performed at least thrice.
