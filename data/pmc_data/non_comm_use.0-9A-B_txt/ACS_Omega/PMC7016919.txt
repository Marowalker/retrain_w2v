As
one of the major impurities in the organic electrolyte, HF can
react with the alkali components in the solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI), such as lithium alkoxide and lithium carbonate, to form more
LiF-rich SEI. Here, the effects of HF on the lithiation behavior of
the single crystal Si(111) anode were studied using scanning electron
microscopy, soft X-ray emission spectroscopy, and windowless energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy. When the Li–Si alloy is formed in 1.0 M
LiPF6 in the propylene carbonate solvent, it has a layered
structure that contained the first layer of crystalline Li15Si4 (c-Li15Si4) alloy pyramids,
the second layer of amorphous Li13Si4 (a-Li13Si4) alloy, and a third layer of Li-diffused LixSi alloy. When the more concentrated HF is
in the electrolyte solution, less amount of the c-Li15Si4 alloy is formed in the first layer. It suggests that the
Si lithiation can form only amorphous LixSi alloy relative to the components in the electrolytes. The study
also explains why only amorphous LixSi
alloy formation was observed in some previous studies.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Si is one of the most
promising candidates among all the anode
materials investigated for Li-based secondary batteries because of
its high theoretical capacity of 3600 mA·h·g–1 when a fully alloyed Li15Si4 phase forms at
room temperature. However, a large volume expansion of close to 400%
prevents the application of Si anodes in Li-based secondary batteries.1−3 The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) between the Si anode and
electrolyte can be destroyed because of the expansion and shrinkage
of the Si anode during a cycle.4 The physical
and chemical stability of the SEI can affect battery performance in
terms of the cycle life and capacity.5−8 An unstable SEI is detrimental to the cycle
life of secondary batteries because the electrolyte is consumed because
of the reaction with the Si anode. Several strategies, such as the
use of Si nanoparticles or nanowires, have proven to be effective
to reduce the volume expansion to reduce damage to the SEI.9−11 In addition, the use of electrolyte additives is also an effective
strategy to form a stable SEI to retard the electrolyte decomposition.12,13

In general, there are some impurities such as H2O or
HF that cannot be eliminated completely in the organic electrolyte.
LiPF6 is commonly used in carbonate-based electrolytes
because of its high solubility in the organic solvent. LiPF6 is thermally unstable when there is trace H2O and easily
decomposes to generate POF3 and another impurity HF, which
will further etch SiO2 in the Si anode.14,15 As an impurity, HF has some beneficial effects on SEI stability
in the Li-based secondary batteries. It can react with the alkali
components in the SEI, such as lithium alkoxide and lithium carbonate,
to form a more LiF-rich SEI which can protect the Si anode.16−19 However, little effort has been devoted to study the effect of HF
on the lithiation behavior of Si anodes, especially on the structures
and compositions of Li–Si alloys. Our previous studies had
verified the availability of using soft X-ray emission spectroscopy
(SXES) and windowless energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to
determine the structures and compositions of electrochemically formed
Li–Si alloys. It is revealed that the Li–Si alloy has
a layered structure and composition, which contains c-Li15Si4, a-Li13Si4, and Li-diffused
LixSi.20,21 The determined
composition consists of three different alloys and differs from other
studies that only reported the c-Li15Si4 alloy22 or only reported the amorphous LixSi alloy23,24 formation. In this
work, we move forward to study how HF, one of the major impurities
in the electrolyte, affects the structures and compositions of the
Li–Si alloy by using these techniques.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1a,b shows
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surface and the cross
section of Li–Si alloys formed in the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte. Figure 1a shows that a large number of pyramid structures (inset figure
in Figure 1a) covered
the Si surface. Figure 1b shows the layered structure of the Li–Si alloy. The first
layer consists of triangular pyramid structures with a height of approximately
0.7 μm. Underneath the first layer, there are the second and
third layers distinguished by the SEM image contrast, respectively.

alloys formed in electrolytes of 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved
in PC containing 0.05 mM HF. In (b), the layered structures of the
first, second, and third layers and Si substrate are represented by
different colored arrows and numbers. The arrow lengths are taken
from the results of the windowless EDS in Figure 4. The compositions are shown according to
the SXES results in (c). (c) SXE spectra for the first, second, third,
and fourth layers of the Li–Si alloy. The peak energies of
53.6 eV in Li Kα and 91.6 eV in Si L2,3 relative to the a-Li13Si4 alloy are indicated.
The peak energies of 53.3 eV in Li Kα and 91.8 eV
in Si L2,3 relative to the c-Li15Si4 alloy are also indicated.

The compositions of the Li–Si alloys were determined using
SXES. Figure 1c shows
SXE spectra for the first, second, and third layers, in addition to
those for Li metal and c-Si as references22,23 in the
photon energy region of 50–105 eV, which covers Li Kα and Si L2,3 X-ray emissions. Combined with density of
states calculations,25 the peak energy
of 53.3 eV in Li Kα and 91.8 eV in Si L2,3 has been indicated to be relative to the c-Li15Si4 alloy, and a peak energy of 53.6 eV in Li Kα and 91.6 eV in Si L2,3 is relative to the a-Li13Si4 alloy.20 The peak energies
were used to determine the compositions of the Li–Si alloys.
The Li Kα and Si L2,3 emission peak energies
of the first layer in the Li–Si alloys formed in propylene
carbonate (PC) were 53.3 and 91.8 eV, respectively, which determined
that the first layer was the c-Li15Si4 alloy.
The Li Kα and Si L2,3 emission peak energies
of the second layer in the Li–Si alloys formed in PC were 53.6
and 91.6 eV, respectively, which determined that the second layer
was the a-Li13Si4 alloy. There was little Li
Kα emission intensity for the third layers because
the Li concentration in the third layer was very low.21 Therefore, the determined composition of the Li–Si
alloy formed in PC were consistent with that reported by Aoki et al.,20 which determined that the first layer was a
c-Li15Si4 alloy and the second layer was a-Li13Si4 alloy, although they used a different solvent
[v(ethylene carbonate, EC)/v(dimethyl carbonate, DMC) = 1:1]. The
composition of the third layer was difficult to determine from the
SXE spectra. It was previously determined to be a Li-diffused LixSi alloy layer using windowless EDS, although
the solvent is DMC in that work.21

As mentioned above, HF and water are two of the major impurities
that cannot be eliminated completely in the LiPF6-containing
organic electrolyte. The HF concentration in the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte was determined to be less than 0.05 mM using IC.
The water content in the electrolytes were determined to be approximately
0.2 mM. In the following section, HF aqueous solution was added in
the electrolyte of 1.0 M LiPF6/PC to study the effects
of HF on the lithiation behavior of the Si anode. Figure 2a–d shows SEM images
of the surface of Li–Si alloys formed in different electrolytes
with more concentrated HF. The HF concentration are shown along with
the water concentration. As is observed, the pyramid structures are
present in all of the Li–Si alloys, and their size is dependent
on the added amount of HF aqueous solution in the electrolytes. Because
46% HF aqueous solution was used, water was also added when we tried
to increase the HF concentration. To make sure water had no effects
on the pyramid formation, only ultrapure water was added into the
electrolyte and the Li–Si alloy formed therein is shown in Figure 2e. Here, the water
concentration of 2.2 mM for Figure 2e is the same as that for Figure 2d, but the HF concentration is only 0.05
mM. Comparing Figure 2a,e, it was found that only 2 mM water addition has negligible effect
on the structure of the Li–Si alloy and does not change the
pyramid size. The sizes of the pyramid structures that are dependent
on the HF concentrations in the electrolytes are shown in Figure 2f. When the more
concentrated HF is in the electrolyte solution, the pyramid size of
the Li–Si alloys decreased. The effect of HF concentration
on the lithiation behavior of Si is also reflected in the current–time
profiles, as shown in Figure 2g. It is observed that all the samples have a maximum lithiation
current. The maximum lithiation current is corresponding to the time
when the pyramids grow to overlap each other. The maximum lithiation
current and its corresponding time decreased when the HF concentration
increased as indicated by the arrow. Because when the HF concentration
increased, more pyramids (the number of pyramids increases in the
same area as shown in Figure 2) are formed to overlap each other earlier. Therefore, an
earlier overlap of the pyramids leads to the decrease of the pyramid
size when the HF concentration increases.

formed in 0.05/0.5/1/2 mM HF containing electrolytes. The water content
is also shown. (a) Enlarged region of Figure 1a. (e) SEM images of the surfaces of Li–Si
alloys formed in the electrolyte that contains 2.2 mM water and 0.05
mM HF. (f) Change in the size (solid dots with an error bar) of the
pyramid structures with the HF concentration for the Li–Si
alloys as shown in (a–d). At least 100 pyramids were measured.
(g) Current–time profile of the Si lithiation in the increased
HF concentration.

The effects of HF can
be better determined by observation of its
effects on the layered structures of the Li–Si alloys. Figure 3a–d shows
SEM images of the cross section of the Li–Si alloys. Layered
structures were observed for all of the Li–Si alloys. The Li–Si
alloy formed in the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte without
aqueous HF addition was determined to consist of the first layer of
crystalline Li15Si4, the second amorphous Li13Si4 layer, and a third Li-diffused LixSi layer. The layer thicknesses of the first and
second layers in different Li–Si alloys were dependent on the
electrolytes with increased HF concentrations.

formed in the electrolytes that contain 0.05/0.5/1/2 mM HF. (a) Enlarged
region of Figure 1b.
(e) Li Kα and (f) Si L2,3 emission spectra
for the first layer in the four Li–Si alloys. (g) Li Kα and (h) Si L2,3 emission spectra for the
second layer in the four Li–Si alloys. The peak energy positions
are represented by dotted lines; the 53.3 and 53.6 eV peaks in the
Li Kα emission spectra and the 91.6 and 91.8 eV peaks
in the Si L2,3 emission spectra.

The effects of HF on the compositions of the Li–Si alloys
were determined using SXES. Figure 3e,f shows SXE spectra for the first layers in the Li–Si
alloys formed in the electrolytes with increased HF concentrations.
When the more concentrated HF is in the electrolyte solution, the
Li Kα emission peak of the Li–Si alloys changed
from 53.3 to 53.6 eV (Figure 3e). The peaks at 53.3 and 53.6 eV were the peak energies of
the Li Kα emission spectra for c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4, respectively, according
to previous analyses.20 The change in the
peak energy from 53.3 to 53.6 eV indicated that the amount of c-Li15Si4 in the first layer was decreased, and instead,
the amount of a-Li13Si4 increased. The Si L2,3 emission peak of the Li–Si alloys changed from 91.8
to 91.6 eV (Figure 3f). The peak energies of the Si L2,3 emission spectra
of c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4 were 91.8 and 91.6 eV, respectively; therefore, the peak shift from
91.8 to 91.6 eV indicated that the first layer preferred to form a-Li13Si4 instead of c-Li15Si4. This result is consistent with that from the observed shift of
the Li Kα emission peak, that is, the amount of c-Li15Si4 in the first layer decreased when the HF concentration
in the electrolyte increased. The compositions of the Li–Si
alloys were thus altered by HF addition.

Figure 3g,h shows
SXE spectra for the second layers in the Li–Si alloys. Although
the electrolytes had more concentrated HF, the Li Kα and Si L2,3 emission peaks of the Li–Si alloys
had the same energy positions of 53.6 and 91.6 eV, respectively. Both
the peak positions correspond to the Li Kα and Si
L2,3 emission peaks of a-Li13Si4.
The results indicated that the composition in the second layer of
all four different Li–Si alloys was a-Li13Si4 and was independent of the HF concentration.

Windowless
EDS can be applied to determine the Li distribution
and the layer thickness in Li–Si alloys. For the Li–Si
alloy formed in the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte, the Li
distribution profile had been determined by windowless EDS and was
consistent with the layered structure determined by SXES.21 The SXE spectral analysis suggested that the
compositions of the Li–Si alloys were different when they were
electrochemically formed in different HF concentrations. As shown
in Figure 4a, the Si L2,3 emission profiles show a
distinguishable intensity change along the layered structure. Although
there is some contrast difference with the third layer, we determine
it as a layer because it has almost no Li Kα emission
intensity and its exact composition cannot be accurately determined.
Windowless EDS was used here to further reveal the extent of the different
compositions, that is, c-Li15Si4, a-Li13Si4, and Li-diffused LixSi
alloy. Figure 4b,c
shows the changes in the intensities of the Li Kα and Si Kα emissions along the line scan from the
pyramid top (the first layer) to the Si substrate for the Li–Si
alloys, respectively. The changes in the Li Kα intensities
were similar for all four Li–Si alloys in Figure 4b. The Li Kα intensity decreased from the first layer to the Si substrate, which
is consistent with the Li–Si alloy-layered structure that consists
of the first c-Li15Si4 layer, the second a-Li13Si4 layer, and a third lowly lithiated LixSi layer over the Si substrate. The boundaries
between the first and second layers and between the second and third
layers can be determined by monitoring the change in the intensity
of the Li Kα peak. It can be easily observed whether
the layer boundaries (dotted arrows) in the Li–Si alloys moved
to lesser depths when the more concentrated HF is in the electrolyte
solution. In Figure 4c, the Si Kα intensity increased from the first
layer to the Si substrate. The boundaries between the second and third
layers could be determined by monitoring the change in the intensity
of the Si Kα peak. It was also observed that the
layer boundaries moved to lesser depths when the more concentrated
HF is in the electrolyte solution, which is consistent with the observed
change in the intensity of the Li Kα peak. However,
changes in the intensities of the Li Kα and Si Kα peaks could not be used to determine the thickness
of each layer in the Li–Si alloys because the boundaries between
the third layer and Si substrate were unclear.

1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte with 0.05 mM HF. SEM image is

is also used for SXE measurement. Windowless EDS (b) Li Kα, (c) Si Kα, and (d) Si L2,3 emission

are shown. The boundary between the first, second, and third layers,
and the Si substrate can be determined by monitoring the intensity
change. In (d), the cyan arrows represent the boundary between the
first and second layers, the dark yellow arrows represent the boundary
between the second and third layers, and the dark green arrows represent
the boundary between the third and fourth layer. (e) Layer thicknesses
of the first, second, and third layers for the four Li–Si alloys
determined from (d).

As reported previously,
the thickness of each layer can be precisely
determined by monitoring the change in the Si L2,3 intensity.21Figure 4d shows the Si L2,3 intensity changes for the four
Li–Si alloys. The boundaries between the first, second, and
third layers, and the Si substrate can be easily determined by monitoring
the change in intensity, as shown by the arrows. The thickness of
each layer for all the four Li–Si alloys can then be easily
determined, and the results are shown in Figure 4e. When the electrolytes had more concentrated
HF from 0 to 2 mM, the first layer’s thickness (the c-Li15Si4 pyramid height) in the Li–Si alloy
decreased from approximately 0.7 to 0.1 μm, and the second layer’s
thickness increased from approximately 1.0 to 1.3 μm. The Li
distribution in the Li–Si alloys was thus changed when the
more concentrated HF is in the electrolyte solution. The thicknesses
of the third layers were almost the same for all the four Li–Si
alloys.

The thickness t can be used to estimate
the amount
of c-Li15Si4, a-Li13Si4, and Li-diffused LixSi alloy in the
Li–Si alloys according to the equation of Q = x·F·V·ρ/(M·A), where Q and A are the charge density and the
electrode area; x, V, ρ, and M are the number of Li atoms, the volume, the mass density,
and the molar mass of LixSiy alloys, respectively. For c-Li15Si4, the volume V is equal to  because it is a pyramid. For a-Li13Si4, the
volume V is A·t. The lithiation charge density was 1000
mC·cm–2 for each Li–Si alloy. The lithiation
charge was due to Li+ ion reduction to alloy Li; therefore,
the amount of Li in c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4 can be evaluated based on their layer thicknesses
to reveal how much charge was used to form c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4. The Li–Si alloy
formed in the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte without HF addition
had approximately 0.7 μm thick c-Li15Si4 (pyramid) and 1.0 μm thick a-Li13Si4 layers. Therefore, the charges used to form c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4 were approximately 180
and 760 mC·cm–2, respectively, in 1000 mC·cm–2 charge, that is, ca. 18 and 76% of the charge were
used to form c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4, respectively. The remaining 6% charge was used for
the formation of the third layer and electrolyte decomposition. As
a comparison, the Li–Si alloy formed in 1.0 M LiPF6/PC with 2 mM HF addition had approximately 0.1 μm thick c-Li15Si4 and 1.3 μm thick a-Li13Si4 layers. The charges used to form c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4 were approximately 30
and 900 mC·cm–2, respectively, that is, ca.
3 and 90% charges were used to form c-Li15Si4 and a-Li13Si4, respectively. The amount of
c-Li15Si4 in the Li–Si alloys decreased
from 18 to 3% and the amount of a-Li13Si4 in
the Li–Si alloys increased from 76 to 90% when the electrolyte
used had 2 mM HF addition, as shown in Figure 4e. Formation of the c-Li15Si4 alloy was generally considered to be detrimental to battery
performance;26,27 therefore, less formation of
c-Li15Si4 in the Li–Si alloy by HF will
be expected to be good for battery performance, although HF is generally
considered to be harmful in battery and needs to be eliminated. However,
a low but suitable amount of HF may be used for the Si-based secondary
battery.

It is now known that HF can reduce the size of the
c-Li15Si4 pyramid structures, that is, increase
the number density
of the pyramid nuclei. The number density of the pyramid nuclei can
be affected by surface electrochemical conditions, such as the surface
electrochemical potential or surface ion concentration. Here, HF addition
may change the surface electrochemical conditions, which then changes
the number density of the pyramid nuclei. It has been reported that
HF can be adsorbed on a Si surface to form F–Si bonds.28−30 The adsorption of F species on Si(111) was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, as shown in Figure 5a. The photoelectron emission intensities
from F 1s increased when the more concentrated HF is in the electrolyte
solution, which indicated that the amount of F on the Si(111) surface
increased. The increase in the amount of the F element was due to
both enhanced LiF (686.5 eV) deposition through Li+ and
F– ions, and to F atom adsorption on the Si(111)
surface to generate F–Si bonds (688.5 eV) as shown in Figure 5b. An intensity reverse
of LiF and F–Si in the 0.5 mM HF sample might be due to the
difference in the formation of the two species. LiF forms in the solution
and deposits onto the Si surface within an uncontrolled amount, but
F–Si forms on the Si surface and its amount is expected to
be relative to HF concentration. Therefore, there is a possibility
that LiF deposit more under uncontrolled amount and the intensity
reverse appear. The adsorption of the F atom on H-terminated Si(111)
can be through the reaction of HF (aq) + SiH (a) = SiF (a) + H2 (g) or HF (aq) + Si–Si (a) = SiF (a) + SiH (a) in
which HF attacks the Si–Si bond as shown in Figure 6. These reactions suggest adsorption
of the F atom to replace H and a strong SiF chemical bond formation
on Si(111).

Figure 5 (a) XPS F 1s spectra for Si(111) after contact with electrolytes
that had increased HF concentrations. Peaks at 688.5 eV are representative
of F–Si species, while those at 686.5 eV are representative
of LiF species. (b) XPS peak areas at 688.5 eV for F–Si on
Si(111) after contact with electrolytes that had more concentrated
HF. The peak area is normalized to Si 2p intensity.

Figure 6 Schematic to illustrate that the Li–Si alloys have smaller
pyramid structures (lesser amount of c-Li15Si4) when the electrolyte is 1.0 M LiPF6/PC with more concentrated
HF.

Fluorine adsorption can increase
the formation of the Li–Si
alloy nuclei because it increases the concentration of surface Li+ ions, which is a function of surface potential according
to the equation31  where Cs is the
concentration of surface Li+ ions, C0 is the bulk Li+ ion concentration, Ø is the surface potential, and F, R, and T are the Faraday constant, gas constant,
and room temperature, respectively. The surface potential Ø becomes more negative by F adsorption,
as schematically shown in Figure 6; therefore, the concentration of surface Li+ ions increases. As a result, the number density of the Li–Si
alloy nuclei on the Si surface increases, which results in the formation
of smaller pyramid structures. This explains why the Li–Si
alloys have smaller pyramid structures (lesser amount of c-Li15Si4) when the electrolyte is 1.0 M LiPF6/PC with a higher HF concentration. In addition to F adsorption to
increase the nuclei number density, the deposition of LiF on the Si
surface might play a role that retards the growth of the c-Li15Si4 pyramid, although some further verification
will be conducted.

3 Conclusions
The
Li–Si alloy prefers to form the a-Li13Si4 alloy instead of c-Li15Si4 when the
more concentrated HF is in the electrolyte solution. Through using
a suitable electrolyte such as using the fluoroethylene carbonate
as the co-solvent which can decompose to generate HF, the Si lithiation
can form only amorphous LixSi alloy. The
study explains why only amorphous LixSi
alloy formation was observed in some previous studies. On the other
hand, less c-Li15Si4 formation in Li–Si
alloys by HF is possible for better battery performance because the
crystalline alloy phase is generally considered to be detrimental
to battery performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
H2SO4 (96–98%),
H2O2 (30–35%), HCl
(35%), and HF (46%) aqueous solutions and anhydrous PC solvent (>98%,
battery grade) were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals. The PC solvent
was dried at least 3 days by a molecular sieve which was pre-dried
in a vacuum at 200 °C for 12 h. Every time before the PC solvent
was used to prepare the fresh electrolyte, PC will be filtered using
a 100 nm nylon filter. NH4F aqueous solution (40%) (semiconductor
grade) was purchased from Morita Chemical Industry. LiPF6 salt (99.9%) and Li wire (99%) were purchased from Kishida Chemical.
LiPF6 was dried under a vacuum at room temperature for
6 h at first and then increase the temperature to 105 °C and
kept for 6 h. The water vapor was trapped by a cold trap using liquid
nitrogen. Si(111) single-crystal wafers (thickness: 500 μm,
resistivity: 1–10 Ω·cm–1, n-type:
phosphorous-doped) were purchased from a Shin-Etsu Semiconductor.
Ultrapure water from a Milli-Q purification system and 99.999% Ar
gas were used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Electrochemically
Formed Li–Si Alloys
under Potentiostatic Lithiation
The Si(111) wafer was cut
into 1.0 × 1.0 cm2 pieces. Hydrogen-terminated Si(111)
was prepared through chemical etching, as reported previously.32 Li wire was used as reference and counter electrodes.
The electrolyte used was 1.0 M LiPF6 dissolved in the PC
solvent. To study the effect of HF, electrolytes of 1.0 M LiPF6 in PC were prepared with the addition of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and
2.0 mM HF aqueous solution. For example, for the addition of 1 mM
HF aqueous solution, 1.5 μL of 46% HF aqueous solution was added
to 40 mL of 1.0 M LiPF6 in PC. Because HF aqueous solution
was used, water was also added simultaneously. For example, 2.2 mM
H2O was included when 2 mM HF aqueous solution was added.
Here, the effect of H2O on the structures and compositions
of the Li–Si alloy was examined separately by the addition
of 2.2 mM pure H2O to the 1.0 M LiPF6/PC electrolyte.
Li–Si alloys were formed under potentiostatic lithiation at
10 mV versus Li/Li+ in these electrolytes to determine
the effects of HF. For each Li–Si alloy, the lithiation charge
density was 1000 mC·cm–2. After electrochemical
formation, the Li–Si alloys were washed with the DMC solvent
and broken in half along the Si ⟨110⟩ direction with
a diamond pen to expose the cross section. The samples were then transferred
using a Ar-filled transfer vessel without air exposure for SXES and
windowless EDS measurements.

4.3 SXES and Windowless EDS
Measurements
SXES and windowless EDS measurements were conducted
using a SXES
system (JEOL, SS-9400SXES) and a windowless silicon drift detector
(SDD) system (Oxford Instruments, X-Max Extreme), respectively. Both
systems are installed in a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, JSM-7800F)
under an ambient pressure of less than 10–4 Pa and
using an accelerating voltage of 5.0 kV.

The incident electron
spot size for SXES was approximately 1.0 μm and a varied line-space
grating (JEOL, JS50XL) was applied with a resolution of approximately
0.15 eV. The probe current and acquisition time were 50 nA and 200
s, respectively. The EDS line scan method was applied by performing
point detection at intervals of 100 nm along the Li–Si alloy
layer. Each point accumulation time was set to 15 s because the accumulated
intensity with this time was appropriate for deconvolution analysis,
and the specimen was not destroyed by the electron beam within 15
s.

4.4 HF Concentration Measurements
The
HF concentration in the electrolytes was measured using an ion chromatography
(IC) system (Dionex, ICS-2100). The electrolytes were diluted 100
times for the purpose of accurate determination.

4.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The surface species
on the Si(111) wafers were investigated using
a 1 × 10–9 Torr base pressure XPS spectrometer
(ULVAC-PHI, VersaProbe II) equipped with an Al Kα source operated at 150 W. High-resolution scans were observed in
constant energy mode with a pass energy of 46.95 eV. The size of the
analysis area on all specimens was set at 220 μm × 220
μm. The Si wafer specimens for XPS measurements were prepared
by immersion in the electrolytes with increased HF concentration and
then washing with DMC to remove the electrolyte.
