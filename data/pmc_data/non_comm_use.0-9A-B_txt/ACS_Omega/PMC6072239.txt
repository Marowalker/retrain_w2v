Brain
glioma is the most lethal type of cancer, with extremely
poor prognosis and high relapse. Unfortunately, the treatment of brain
glioma is often limited because of the low permeability of anticancer
drugs across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). To circumvent this,
magnetic mesoporous nanoparticles were synthesized and loaded with
doxorubicin as an anticancer agent. These nanoparticles were fabricated
with Pluronic F-127 and subsequently conjugated with transferrin (Tf)
to achieve the sustained release of the drug at the targeted
site. The physicochemical properties of the conjugated nanoparticles
were analyzed using different techniques. The magnetic saturation
of the nanoparticles determined by a vibration sample magnetometer
was found to be 26.10 emu/g. The cytotoxicity study was performed
using the MTT assay at 48 and 96 h against the U87 cell line. The
Tf-conjugated nanoparticles (DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf) exhibited a significant
IC50 value (0.570 μg/mL) as compared to the blank
nanoparticles (121.98 μg/mL). To understand the transport mechanism
of drugs across the BBB, an in vitro BBB model using human brain microvascular
endothelial cells was developed. Among the nanoparticles, the Tf-conjugated
nanoparticles demonstrated an excellent permeability across the BBB.
This effect was predominant in the presence of an external magnetic
field, suggesting that magnetic particles present in the matrix facilitated
the uptake of drugs in U87 cells. Finally, it is concluded that nanoparticles
conjugated with Tf effectively crossed the BBB. Thus, the developed
nanocarriers can be considered as potential candidates to treat brain
tumor.

1 Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme
is a malignant glial tumor and a commonly
occurring type of primary astrocytomas. It accounts for more than
60% of all brain tumors in adults.1 Patients
usually have a less survival rate of approximately 14 to 15 months
after diagnosis.2,3 Even with advances in treatment
modalities, it remains largely incurable because of the presence of
complexities associated with the target-specific treatment across
the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The structure of the BBB involves
the complex design of tight junctions between the endothelial cells.
These cells are known to express the efflux transport proteins, which
maintain the homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) by controlling
the transport of substances into the brain.4,5

Recently, nanotechnology has shown an immense application in cancer-targeted
therapy.6−9 Cancer-targeted nano drug-delivery systems are particularly expected
to enhance the anticancer activity while minimizing the side effects,
and thus showing an excellent potential application in cancer therapy.10−12 There are various biocompatible materials that have created a tremendous
curiosity in cancer therapy, viz., silica nanoparticles (NPs),13,14 nanoliposomes,15 and magnetic NPs (MNPs).16 With certain modifications in these materials,
we can prolong the drug’s half-life, increase its viability
in the blood circulation, and allow the specific cell-targeting properties.
To address this, Chen et al.17 developed
a magnetic drug-delivery system in which doxorubicin (DOX) was chemically
bonded to Fe3O4 NPs, and it was then embedded
in polyethylene glycol (PEG) to functionalize the porous silica shell.
Similarly, Guan et al.18 developed a multitargeted
oleic acid (OA)–MNPs and demonstrated an excellent in vivo
and in vitro efficacy in treating the human cervical cancer HeLa cells.
These studies concluded that MNPs loaded with effective antitumor
drugs offered physical therapy, which has advantages over the other
nonloaded drugs, such as small particle size, large specific surface,
high-capacity coupling, and good magnetic response. With these possibilities,
one can overcome the drawbacks of the conventional treatment strategies.19−21 The mesoporous silica NPs are likely to play an important role for
designing the drug carriers that plague cancer therapy because of
their low toxicity, biocompatibility, controllable particle size and
pore morphologies, and facile surface decoration.22−26 While modifying the MNPs, surface functionalization
is also an important strategy, which can be achieved by choosing the
appropriate species, such as polymers, surfactants, and biomolecules.27,28 Pluronic copolymer is especially promising for the modification
of NPs. Pluronic F-127 is an FDA-approved biocompatible and thermoreversible
block copolymer, which contains poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene
oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) blocks. Wei et al.29 developed micelles to combat the multidrug resistance
(MDR) using Pluronic P-123 (PP-123) and Pluronic F-127 (PF-127). Owing
to the sensitizing properties of PP-123 and the long circulation effect
of PF-127, the micelles could be able to enhance the activity of paclitaxel
to overcome the MDR in lung cancer. Pluronic micelles have also been
studied to bypass the BBB for drug delivery to the CNS.30 In the past few years, it has been found that
the modification of drug-delivery carriers with targeting ligands
can improve the transport efficiency across the BBB.31−34 Recently, it has been reported that a high level of Tf receptors
(Tf-Rs) was expressed in brain capillary endothelial cells and glioma
cells involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis through the BBB.35,36 These receptors could be targeted with the corresponding ligands.
Consequently, Tf crosses the intact BBB freely, which helps to carry
the essential nutrients into the brain.

Understanding the pros
and cons of the aforesaid materials and
the strategies adopted, we have synthesized the functionalized magnetic
mesoporous NPs loaded with DOX as an anticancer agent. These NPs were
carefully fabricated with PF-127 and subsequently conjugated with
Tf to promote its infiltration across the BBB and also for achieving
the sustained release of the drug at the targeted site. The physicochemical
properties of the resulting NPs were evaluated with different techniques.
The size and shape of the NPs were determined using dynamic light
scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The retention
of magnetic property subsequent to the coating of silica and the polymer
on the developed NPs was tested using a vibrating sample magnetometer.
The cytotoxicity study was carried out using MTT assay after 48 and
96 h of treatment against the U87 cell line. A BBB model with human
brain microvascular endothelial (HBME) cells was developed to study
the passage of drugs across the barrier. Among the carriers developed,
the Tf-conjugated carriers demonstrated an excellent permeability
across the barrier through receptor-mediated transcytosis. This behavior
was predominant in the presence of magnetic field, as evidenced by
the data.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
and Characterization of Nanocarriers
The present work was
focused to design and develop the temperature-responsive
polymer nanocarriers for the targeted delivery of an anticancer DOX
drug to achieve an enhanced anticancer activity against glioma cells.
The stepwise preparation of magnetic mesoporous nanocarriers is shown
in Schemes 1–6. The MNPs were synthesized by an aqueous
co-precipitation approach in the presence of ammonia. To create
the pores for drug loading, the mesoporous magnetic silica NPs were
prepared using triethylorthosilicate (TEOS) along with decane and
1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene (TIPB) as pore swelling agents. Further,
these were functionalized with amino groups using (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES). PF-127 was chosen as it is known to bypass the BBB. In addition
to this, it is also known as a thermoresponsive polymer because of
its lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which facilitates
the formation of self-assembly around the body temperature.37 Before conjugating the MNP-MSN, the end groups
(−OH) of PF-127 were modified with the −COOH group using
succinic anhydride (SA). The amino groups present on the surface of
MNP-MSN were then covalently attached to the −COOH group of
PF-127 via the 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) approach. The permeation
of drugs across the BBB and cancer-targeting properties were introduced
in this synthesized MNP-MSN-PF-127 through the conjugation of Tf.

The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of OA-MNP, MNP-MSN,
MNP-MSN-NH2, PF-127, modified PF-127 (MPF-127), MNP-MSN-MPF-127,
Tf, and MNP-MSN-MPF-127-Tf were recorded in the range of 400–4000
cm–1. All the bands showed expected stretching,
indicating that the preparation of MNPs and their stabilization with
OA and mesoporous silica NPs with TEOS; functionalization of mesoporous
silica NPs with APTES; and modification of PF-127 with SA, MNP-MSN-PF-127,
and Tf-conjugated MNP-MSN-PF-127 were successfully achieved. However,
the spectra of these are not included to minimize the number of figures.
Only the representative spectra such as those of MNP-MSN-PF-127, Tf,
and MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf are presented in Figure 1. The bands that appeared at around 1560
and 1650 cm–1 in the spectrum of MNP-MSN-PF-127
are respectively attributed to the stretching and deformation vibrations
of the amide bonds that are covalently bonded between PF-127 and MNP-MSN-NH2. The Tf exhibited bands at around 1280, 1530, and 1660 cm–1, and these are respectively assigned to amide III,
amide II, and amide I. The intensity of these bands decreased significantly
owing to the reaction that occurred between amide groups of Tf and
−COOH groups of PF-127. This suggests that Tf was successfully
conjugated on the surface of MNP-MSN-PF-127.

Tf, and MNP-MSN-MPF-127-Tf.

To know the distribution of the hydrodynamic size of the
resulting
nanocarriers, the dispersed NPs in water were analyzed in a zeta-sizer
using the DLS technique. The resulting data are presented in Figure 2. The data revealed
that the hydrodynamic size of the nanocarriers was approximately 159
nm. Further, to know the physical stability of the colloidal dispersions,
the zeta potential was measured and was found to be −26.3 mV.
This suggests that carriers developed in the present study have a
relatively narrow size distribution, better dispersity, and stability
in aqueous solution. The synthesized magnetic mesoporous silica NPs
and their resulting conjugation with PF-127 before drug loading were
subjected to TEM by carefully depositing them on a copper grid. The
images thus obtained are presented in Figure 3. From the image of MNP-MSN, it is observed
that the size of the particles was mainly in the range of 60–80
nm, with an iron oxide nanocrystal core located at the center. The
observed mesoporous structure was also supported by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms, which demonstrated that MNP-MSNs have a uniform pore size
distribution of around 2.66 nm. However, when these particles were
conjugated with PF-127, the size of the particles was increased to
110 nm. This can be attributed to the presence of a thin polymer coating
on the surface of MNP-MSN. This clearly ascertains the successful
modification of NPs with PF-127. However, some agglomeration was also
observed in both the images, and this might be due to their magnetization
energy.

The thermogravimetric analyses of magnetic mesoporous
silica NPs
and their conjugation with PF-127 are shown in Figure 4. It is observed that in both the thermograms,
the weight loss was observed in three stages. The first weight loss
was observed up to 100 °C in both the thermograms and is mainly
because of the loss of adsorbed water molecules. PF-127-coated NPs
exhibited relatively low weight loss of 4 wt %. On the contrary, magnetic
mesoporous NPs exhibited a higher weight loss of about 12 wt %. This
indicates that the mesoporous NPs have a higher hydrophilic character
owing to the presence of −OH groups. In the second stage (100–500
°C), the weight loss was significant for PF-127-coated mesoporous
NPs, which corresponds to around 20 wt %. This is mainly due to the
weight loss of PF-127. For mesoporous NPs, it is about 7 wt %, which
corresponds to the weight loss of mesoporous silica. Further weight
loss was observed beyond 500 °C in both the cases because of
the oxidation of MNPs. From the thermograms, it was also observed
that PF-127-coated NPs were relatively more stable than magnetic mesoporous
NPs. On the basis of the evidence, we can conclude that the resulting
PF-127-coated NPs have an adequate thermal stability with a sufficient
polymer coating, suggesting that the coated amount of PF-127 is enough
to get the compatibility and dispersity for the controlled delivery
of drugs.

To authenticate the feasibility
and sensitivity of the developed
NPs as targeted contrast agents, it is important to retain the favorable
magnetic property of the NPs after the surface modification. Accordingly,
the magnetization property of the OA-stabilized NPs (OA-MNP) and MNP-MSN-PF-127
NPs was determined at room temperature using a vibration sample magnetometer
(VSM). The data thus obtained are presented in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Magnetization curve of OA-MNP and MNP-MSN-PF-127.

Both the samples did not show
coercivity forces, indicating that
both have a good superparamagnetism property with no remnant magnetization
and hysteresis. For OA-MNP, the saturation magnetism (Ms) was found to be 41.7 emu/g. However, the saturation
magnetism of MNP-MSN-PF-127 was found to be 26.1 emu/g. The results
suggest that after the modification with silica and PF-127, the MNP-MSN-PF-127
exhibited a superparamagnetic nature with reduced magnetization compared
to OA-MNP, signifying their successful modification. Evidently, the
particles developed here (MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf) would certainly contribute
to a stronger responsiveness against the magnetic field. Thus, the
resulting carriers could be guided to a specific tumor site efficiently
with an enhanced therapeutic effect. During the synthesis of MNP-MSNs,
the swelling agents such as decane and TIPB were employed to create
pores in the NPs so as to improve the drug-loading capacity. The nitrogen
gas adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore size distribution
of the mesoporous silica NPs are presented in Figure 6A,Brespectively.

Figure 6 (A) Nitrogen gas adsorption–desorption
isotherms for MNP-MSN
NPs. (B) Pore size distribution obtained from adsorption measurements.

The pore size distribution obtained
from the isotherms after the
eviction of CTAB from MNP-MSN was determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method. The CTAB is known to dictate the structure of the pore
size. On the basis of the nature of the plot, it was found that the
resulting MNP-MSN NPs demonstrated type IV adsorption–desorption
isotherms, and Figure 6A resembles H1 hysteresis occurring from P/P0, which is associated with the presence of
uniform mesopores. Similarly, using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) equation, the specific surface area and pore volume of the MNP-MSN
NPs were determined as ∼257.4 m2/g and 0.53 cm3/g, respectively. The pore diameter of the magnetic mesoporous
silica NPs as determined by the peak of Figure 6B was found to be ∼2.66 nm.

2.2 Encapsulation Efficiency and in Vitro Release
of Drugs
One of the important characteristics of the drug-delivery
system in the field of biomedicine is to impart the sustained release
of drug. Generally, an ideal drug carrier should possess enhanced
encapsulation efficiency (EE) and a high drug-loading ability. To
study this, the drug was loaded into MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf NPs and the
percentage of drug-loading capacity and EE was determined. It was
found that the loading capacity and EE of DOX in MNP-MSN were 36.88
and 92.2%, respectively. After the modification with PF-127 and Tf,
the loading capacity and EE of DOX were found to be 34.6 and
86.5%, respectively. The in vitro drug release study was performed
by dispersing the drug-loaded NPs (MNP-MSN-PF-127-DOX-Tf) in a phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) solution of pH 7.4 containing 0.05% (w/v) of Tween 80.
To understand the thermoresponsive behavior of the NPs, the release
profile of DOX-loaded NPs under the influence of temperature was measured
at 37 and 42 °C, and the data are presented in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Release profile of DOX
from MNP-MSN-PF-127 at 37 and 42 °C.

It is observed that during the first 24 h at 37 °C,
the release
of DOX was predominant and reached around 17.2%, and thereafter, a
power law release pattern was observed. This might be due to a combined
effect of the physically adhered drug and the drug present in the
mesoporous structure. However, when the temperature was raised to
42 °C, the release of DOX was significantly increased from 17.2
to 32.2% for 24 h and reached up to 51.4% for 120 h. This must be
due to a collapsed structure of PF-127. This is expected because the
LCST of PF-127 is close to 42 °C. From this, it can be concluded
that the block copolymer of PF-127 demonstrated the combined and complementary
role of the stimuli-responsive drug-delivery carrier where the PF-127
segment was responsible for the fabrication of thermoresponsive MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf
at body temperature (37 °C). The externally coated PPF-127 effectively
delayed the release of DOX from the mesopores of silica under physiological
conditions such as temperature 37 °C and pH 7.4, suggesting that
the nanocarrier developed (MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf) here is a potential
candidate for the delivery of drugs. Thus, the sustained drug release
improves the accumulation of DOX at the tumor site while enhancing
the anticancer efficiency.

To investigate the nature of the
release mechanism, we have fitted
the in vitro DOX release data in an empirical relation38−40 1  where Mt and M∞ are the
cumulative DOX release from the NPs at time t and
∞, respectively. The parameters n and k were estimated by the method of least squares at the 95%
confidence limit, and these data are presented in Table 1. The parameter k represents the extent of interaction between the DOX and NPs. The
exponent n represents the nature of the release mechanism.
For instance, if n ≤ 0.45, it corresponds
to the Fickian mechanism. For anomalous behavior, the value of n lies between 0.5 and 0.75 (i.e., it slightly deviates
from the Fickian trend). In the present study, the obtained values
of n vary from 0.6175 to 0.6589. Thus, the release
of DOX from the NPs was found to follow an anomalous type of behavior.40−42

2.3 In Vitro
Cytotoxicity of Drug-Loaded NPs
To assess the cytotoxicity
of the drug-loaded NPs in U87 cells,
the MTT assay was performed under various conditions at 48 and 96
h, and the results thus obtained are presented in Figure 8A,B, respectively.

Figure 8 (A) Viability

drug (DOX), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 (DOX-NP), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 with external
magnetic field (DOX-NP-MAG), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-TF (DOX-NP-Tf), and
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external magnetic field (DOX-NP-Tf-MAG)
at 48 h. (B) Viability of U87 cells after treatment with blank NPs,
free drug (DOX), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 (DOX-NP), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 with
external magnetic field (DOX-NP-MAG), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-TF (DOX-NP-Tf),
and DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external magnetic field (DOX-NP-Tf-MAG)
at 96 h.

It is observed that the cytotoxicity
of the drug-loaded NPs is
dependent on the drug concentration and the treatment period. The
determined IC50 values of the blank NPs, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127,
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 with external magnetic field, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf,
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external magnetic field, and DOX for 48
h were found to be 121.98, 60.96, 43.69, 0.57, 0.172, and 0.051 μg/mL,
respectively; and for 96 h, they were 106.33, 52.69, 38.49, 0.074,
0.039, and 0.015 μg/mL, respectively. The data revealed that
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf exhibited significantly lower IC50 values as compared to blank NPs, indicating its potential anticancer
effect. This can be attributed to the presence of drugs and Tf in
the mesoporous NPs. However, the IC50 value was found to
be substantially low because of the application of an external magnetic
field, highlighting the importance of the external magnetic field
in the application of these NP conjugates. Obviously, the enhanced
cytotoxicity effect is due to the influence of the magnetic field,
which favors the binding of MNPs on the cells, and therefore, the
percentage of cell viability decreased. At 96 h, a significant cytotoxicity
effect was observed when compared to 48 h, and this effect might be
due to a longer treatment period. The blank NPs did not show any noticeable
cytotoxicity even at 1.0 μg/mL concentration. However, some
effect on the cell viability was noticed when the concentration of
NPs reached beyond 1.0 μg/mL.

2.4 Drug
Uptake Studies in U87 Cells
The uptake of the drug-loaded
NPs in U87 cells was quantified using
a flow cytometer, and the data thus obtained are presented in Figure 9. The geometric-mean
fluorescence intensities of DOX in the cells treated with DOX, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf,
and DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external magnetic field were found
to be 2462, 7940, and 13791, respectively. To compare the data, the
geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the untreated cells (control)
was also determined and is shown in Figure 9. From the data, it is observed that the
cells treated with DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf conjugates showed a significant
increase in the fluorescence intensity as compared to DOX. This is
due to the presence of Tf protein, which itself helps to bind the
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf conjugates with U87 cell lines. Similarly, the
fluorescence intensity increased further when the external magnetic
field was applied. This again signifies the importance of the external
magnetic field as observed in cell viability results.

control, (b) DOX, (c) DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf, and (d) DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf
with external magnetic field at a concentration 5 μg/mL for
4 h. DOX intensity is denoted as FL2-A.

2.5 In Vitro Drug Uptake Studies in U87 across
the BBB Model
Targeting the brain or the CNS is a major challenge
for designing the therapeutics to address the neuronal pathology.
Only 5% of the drugs listed in the comprehensive medicinal chemistry
database target the CNS, and this is mainly due to the intact and
complex structure of the BBB.43 To mimic
the permeability of NPs through a tightly intact BBB, an in vitro
model was established using HBME cell lines. A two-chamber transwell
system was separated by the membrane as a barrier on which HBME cells
were cultured. The HBME cells were incubated with 5 μg/mL test
drug (DOX), DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 with external magnetic
field, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf, and DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external
magnetic field for 4 h at 37 °C, and their corresponding fluorescence
intensities were measured using a flow cytometer, and the results
thus obtained are presented in Figure 10. From the data, we have estimated the geometric
mean fluorescence intensity for DOX, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127
(with magnetic field), DOX-MNP-MSN-Tf, and DOX-MNP-MSN-Tf (with magnetic
field), and the values are found to be 4296, 4993, 5037, 5968, and
56747, respectively. It is explicitly indicated that in the presence
of the BBB model, the cells treated with DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf showed
a higher drug uptake compared to the cells treated with DOX. The higher
uptake of DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf by the HBME cells is due to a combined
interaction of PF-127 and Tf on the cell membrane. The PF-127 polymer
is known to promote active membrane transport, whereas Tf enhances
the cellular uptake of the drug-loaded NPs. This is expected because the
Tf-Rs are proven to overexpress in both the brain capillary endothelium
and glioma cells. Though the BBB was present, cells treated with DOX-MNP-MSN-Tf
in the presence of a magnetic field showed the highest accumulation
of DOX among the five experimental groups.

with external magnetic field in the BBB model at 5 μg/mL concentration
for 4 h. DOX intensity is denoted as FL2-A.

3 Conclusions
In this study, we have
systematically synthesized the DOX-loaded
magnetic mesoporous NPs. These were subsequently coupled with PF-127
followed by conjugation with Tf so as to achieve the sustained release
of drugs at the targeted site. The size and shape of the NPs determined
by DLS and TEM were adequate and suitable for crossing the BBB. The
magnetic saturation of the developed NPs was found to be 26.10 emu/g,
indicating that even after coating with the silica and polymer, the
NPs sufficiently retained their magnetic property. The cytotoxicity
assay clearly indicated that the Tf-conjugated NPs (DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf)
exhibited a significantly lower IC50 value (0.570 μg/mL)
at 37 °C for 48 h as compared to the blank NPs (121.98 μg/mL).
This is due to the presence of drugs and Tf in the NPs. Thus, the
functionalized nanocarriers developed here sensibly recognize and
bind to U87 cells selectively. From the in vitro study, it is clearly
suggested that DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf exhibited a much higher anticancer
activity and permeability across the BBB than the free DOX, and therefore,
glioma cells undergo apoptosis through receptor-mediated transcytosis.
Further, in the presence of magnetic field, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf
enhanced its permeability across the BBB, and thereby a satisfactory
efficacy was achieved in regard to the antiglioblastoma activity.
On the basis of the results, we anticipate that nanocarriers (DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf)
developed in this investigation provide an effective strategy to target
and antagonize the glioblastoma by successfully crossing the BBB.

as received. Deionized Millipore water was used throughout the experiments.

4.2 Synthesis of MNPs
Magnetic iron NPs
were synthesized using the co-precipitation method.44 Briefly, 30 mL of 0.1 M FeCl3 and 15 mL of 0.1
M FeCl2 solutions were mixed and heated at 80 °C for
10 min under constant stirring in a nitrogen atmosphere. To this,
3 mL of 5 M ammonium hydroxide was added and stirred further at the
same temperature for 30 min. To obtain sterically stabilized MNPs,
100 μL of OA (23 wt %) was added drop-wise to the solution and
stirred for 30 min. The resulting mixture was subsequently incubated
at 80 °C for 50 min. The mixture was then heated to 110 °C
so as to evaporate the excess ammonium hydroxide and water. The black
precipitate thus obtained was washed several times with deionized
water and followed by acetone to remove the excess OA. Each time,
washing was removed by magnetic decantation, and finally, it was subjected
to lyophilization to obtain the stabilized MNPs in a powder form.
The synthetic protocols for the preparation of MNPs are presented
in Scheme 1.

4.3 Synthesis of MNP-MSNs
The mesoporous
silica MNPs were synthesized using the modified method.45 Briefly, 25 mg of stabilized MNPs were dispersed
in 2 mL of chloroform, and the entire solution was poured into a beaker
containing 17 mL of 0.4 M CTAB solution. The resulting mixture was
sonicated at 50 °C for 30 min to obtain a homogeneous microemulsion,
and this was further heated to 70 °C and incubated for 15 min
under stirring to evaporate the residual chloroform. The MNPs were
subsequently transferred into a solution, consisting of 50 mL water,
17 mL of EG, and 1.2 mL of NH4OH, and kept for heating
at 70 °C for 10 min under stirring. To create the pores in the
NPs, 1.77 mL of decane and 0.725 mL of TIPB were added to the resulting
mixture and stirred for 2 h at the same temperature. Decane was added
2 h prior to TIPB. To this, 0.5 mL of TEOS was added drop-wise with
constant stirring for 3 h at 70 °C and cooled. The product thus
obtained was washed and lyophilized and designated as MNP-MSNs. The
reaction is shown in Scheme 2.

4.4 DOX Loading and Amine Functionalization
To load the DOX into MNP-MSNs, the organic surfactant was removed
initially by dissolving 60 mg of MNP-MSNs in 60 mL ethanol containing
160 mg of ammonium nitrate at 60 °C and kept for 30 min. The
product thus obtained was washed with ethanol and water, centrifuged,
and dried. Out of the resulting quantity, 15 mg of MNP-MSNs was suspended
in ethanol. The suspension was then mixed with 10 mg of DOX and stirred
for 24 h under dark conditions. The surface of the MNP-MSNs was then
functionalized with amino groups by adding 2.5 μL of APTES to
the drug-loaded suspension while stirring for 8 h at room temperature.
The functionalized drug-loaded NPs were then isolated and subjected
to centrifugation to remove the excess APTES. The supernatant was
analyzed using a UV–vis spectrophotometer at 480 nm to estimate
the extent of drug loading and encapsulation. The loading of drug
and amine functionalization is presented in Scheme 3.

4.5 End-Group Modification
of Pluronic F-127
The end-group modification of PF-127 was
carried out by dissolving
1.4 g of anhydrous PF-127 in 25 mL of 1,4 dioxane followed by the
addition of 26 mg of SA, 30 mg of DMAP, and 32 mL of TEA. The mixture
was stirred under N2 atmosphere for 24 h at room temperature.
After evaporation of the solvent, a white residue was obtained. This
residue was then dissolved in 40 mL of chloroform to remove the unreacted
SA by filtration. The collected transparent filtrate was precipitated
by adding excess cold diethyl ether batch-wise. The precipitate so
obtained was dried under vacuum and stored for later use. The preparation
of end-group modification is presented in Scheme 4.

4.6 Synthesis of MNP-MSN-PF-127
Before
the conjugation of PF-127 to DOX-loaded MNP-MSNs, the modified PF-127
was cross-linked with EDC. The EDC is an efficient cross-linking agent
for the polymers having carboxyl groups, which is being used to activate
the carboxyl groups toward the formation of amide or ester. Briefly,
40 mg of modified PF-127 and 90 mg of EDC together with 52 mg of NHS
were dissolved in 5 mL of water and stirred for 6 h. To this aqueous
dispersion, amino-functionalized MNP-MSN NPs (50 mg particles in 10
mL of water) were added, and the pH of the mixture was adjusted to
5.8. The mixture was kept in an oven oscillator (150 rpm) for 72 h
at room temperature. The resulting drug-loaded nanocarriers were washed
several times with distilled water, centrifuged, freeze-dried, and
stored for further use. The reaction process of drug-loaded nanocarriers
is presented in Scheme 5.

4.7 Conjugation of Tf on Drug-Loaded Nanocarriers
To conjugate the Tf to drug-loaded nanocarriers, 10 mg of drug-loaded
MNP-MSN-PF-127 was dispersed in the mixture containing 5 mL of PBS,
250 μL of EDC (1 mg/mL), and 250 μL of NHS (1 mg/mL).
The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h to create
amine-reactive esters on the carboxylic acid–terminated PF-127.
Using EDC and NHS, Tf was conjugated to MNP-MSN-PF-127 from the reaction
that occurred between the −COOH groups of PF-127 and −NH2 groups on Tf molecules. The nanocarriers thus obtained were
dispersed in 2 mL of PBS. To this mixture, 100 μL of Tf (1 mg/mL)
was added drop-wise and stirred for 2 h, and later it was incubated
at 4 °C overnight. The composite NPs were collected by centrifugation
and washed several times with water to remove the unreacted species.
Finally, the product was lyophilized and stored at 4 °C. The
synthesis of Tf-conjugated drug-loaded nanocarriers is shown in Scheme 6.

4.8 Characterization of NPs
The modified
NPs with different functionalities were characterized using an FTIR
spectrometer (Nicolet, Impact-410, USA). The particle size and the
zeta potential of the modified NPs were determined using a zeta-sizer
(Anton-Paar, Litesizer 500, USA). On the basis of the DLS principle,
light-scattering measurements were performed using a laser of wavelength
658 nm at a 90° scattering angle. Samples were prepared by dispersing
the modified NPs in deionized water (0.5 mg/mL) at 25 °C. The
diameter and morphology of the modified NPs were also visualized using
TEM (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The samples were prepared by dispersing
the modified NPs (500 mg/mL) in Millipore water employing ultrasonication
for 3 min. One drop of this suspension was deposited carefully on
a 300 mesh carbon-coated TEM copper grid and air-dried at room temperature.
Thermal stability of the modified NPs was assessed in the temperature
range of 25–800 °C using TGA (TGA Q 20, TA Instruments,
Waters LLC, USA) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen
(100 mL/min) atmosphere. The magnetic saturation of MNP-MSNs-PF-127
was evaluated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (Lakeshore VSM
7410, USA) at room temperature. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms obtained were used to calculate the pore size distribution
and the specific surface area using BJH and BET (BET surface area
analyzer, Micromeritics, Japan) after removing the CTAB template.
The concentration of DOX was determined using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(Hitachi U-2800, Japan).

4.9 Drug Loading and in Vitro
Release Study
Before performing the drug-release study, the
EE and loading content
(LC) of the drug in the developed NPs were respectively determined
using eqs 2 and 3. 2   3  

The in vitro drug release study was
performed in triplicates at two different temperatures of 37 and 42
°C. Briefly, 10 mg of drug-loaded NPs was dispersed in 5 mL of
pH 7.4 PBS solution containing 0.05% (w/v) of Tween 80. The resulting
mixture was allowed to stir at 37 and 42 °C separately by keeping
in an incubator shaker. At different time intervals, 1 mL of the supernatant
was removed from each solution and then replaced by adding the same
volume of fresh PBS. The concentration of DOX was estimated by measuring
its absorbance at a fixed wavelength of 480 nm.

4.10 Cell Culture
The human primary glioblastoma
cell line (U87 MG) was procured from the National Centre for Cell
Science (NCCS, Pune, India), and HBME cells were procured from Cell
Systems (Washington, USA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1%
penicillin–streptomycin in a humidified incubator at 37 °C
and 5% CO2.

4.11 In Vitro Cytotoxicity
Assay of Drug-Loaded
Nanocarriers
The cytotoxic effect of blank NPs, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf,
DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with external magnetic field, and free DOX was
determined using the MTT assay, based on the reduction of (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) to formazan in metabolically viable cells. Briefly, U87 cells
were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of approximately 5000
cells per well. On the following days, the cells were treated with
different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 μg/mL)
of blank NPs, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127 with external
magnetic field, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf with
external magnetic field, and DOX. The cells were cultivated in the
presence of an external magnetic field using a magnet placed under
each well plate. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were washed with
PBS to remove the unbound drug and replaced with a fresh growth medium.
The cell viability was determined using Cell Titer 96 Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay. Dye solution (50 μL) was added to
100 μL of the medium in each well. The plates were gently shaken
and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere.
The supernatant was removed and 100 μL of DMSO was added, and
the plates were gently shaken to solubilize the formed formazan. The
absorbance was then measured with a microplate spectrophotometer at
540 nm.

4.12 Cellular Internalization of NPs
The cellular uptake of NPs, such as DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf
with external magnetic field, and DOX, was determined using a flow
cytometer. In brief, U87 cells were seeded onto a six-well culture
plate or slide flask at a density of 3 × 105 cells/2
mL and incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 24
h. Later, the cells were treated with DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf, DOX-MNP-MSN-PF-127-Tf
with external magnetic field, and DOX (5 μg/mL) at 4 h in a
humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The untreated cells
were used as a control. After treatment, the cells were washed twice
with PBS to remove the unbound NPs followed by trypsinization and
resuspension in 500 μL of PBS. Flow cytometric analysis was
carried out in a DOX channel employing an FL2-A detector (Becton Dickinson,
BD Accuri C6, USA). All the results were expressed in terms of mean
fluorescence intensity.

4.13 Drug Uptake across the
BBB Using an in Vitro
Model
The BBB model was established using a method previously
described by Cui et al.46 A 0.2% gelatin
solution was used to precoat the trans-well inserts, which was then
aspirated out, and the inserts were allowed to dry in a biosafety
cabinet hood for 1 h. The HBME cells were seeded at a density of 1
× 105 cells per well and incubated for 7 days. The
growth medium was changed every 2 days. After 7 days, the transendothelial
electrical resistance value of the BBB was measured using EVOM and
EVOMX Epithelial Voltohmmeters (World Precision Instruments, Inc.,
FL, USA) and was found to be 250 Ω cm2. The inserts
containing cultured HBME cells were then transferred to a six-well
plate containing 24 h old cultured U87 cells. The medium was aspirated
from the inserts containing the HBME cells. These cells were treated
with the required concentration of test compounds (5 μg/mL)
in 2 mL of culture medium and incubated for 4 h. One of the wells
was left untreated and was considered as a negative control. At the
end of the treatment, the inserts were removed from the six-well plates,
and the medium was transferred into 15 mL centrifuge tubes. The centrifuged
mass was washed with 500 μL of PBS. Subsequently, the PBS solution
was removed and 200 μL of trypsin–EDTA solution was added
to it, and this was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The culture
medium was poured back into their respective wells, and the cells
were harvested directly into the centrifuge tubes. The cells were
subsequently washed with 1 mL of 1× D-PBS and subjected to centrifugation
at 300g, and the separated D-PBS was discarded. Following
this, 0.5 mL (2%) of paraformaldehyde was added to the cells and incubated
at room temperature for 15 min, which was later centrifuged at 300g to discard the solution. Again, the cells were washed
with 1 mL of 1× D-PBS and subjected to centrifugation at 300g and the separated D-PBS was discarded. Finally, 500 μL
of D-PBS was added and mixed thoroughly to have a dispersed cell suspension,
which was immediately subjected to a flow cytometer analysis using
an FL2-A detector.
