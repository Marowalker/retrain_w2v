We report water-splitting
application of chemically stable self-grown
nickel sulfide (NixSy) electrocatalysts of different nanostructures including
rods, flakes, buds, petals, etc., synthesized by a hydrothermal method
on a three-dimensional Ni foam (NiF) in the presence of different
sulfur-ion precursors, e.g., thioacetamide, sodium thiosulfate, thiourea,
and sodium sulfide. The S2– ions are produced after
decomposition from respective sulfur precursors, which, in general,
react with oxidized Ni2+ ions from the NiF at optimized
temperatures and pressures, forming the NixSy superstructures. These NixSy electrocatalysts are
initially screened for their structure, morphology, phase purity,
porosity, and binding energy by means of various sophisticated instrumentation
technologies. The as-obtained NixSy electrocatalyst from sodium thiosulfate endows
an overpotential of 200 mV. The oxygen evolution overpotential results
of NixSy electrocatalysts
are comparable or superior to those reported previously for other
self-grown NixSy superstructure morphologies.

1 Introduction
The
oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting is a top
agenda in electrocatalytic energy storage applications.1−7 From the cost and availability points of view, ruthenium oxide and
platinum electrode materials are envisaged rarely for OER applications
in the past; therefore, the research activities are being focused
on developing OER electrode materials, such as Co3S4, NiS, MnS, Bi2S3, CuS, etc.8−15 Among them, nickel sulfide (NixSy), with various phases α-NiS, β-NiS,
NiS2, Ni3S2, Ni3S4, Ni7S6, Ni9S8, etc., has been used, in the past, for electrocatalytic applications.16−21 For the case of water splitting, an electrocatalyzer assembly consisting
of a cathode (platinum–carbon) for the hydrogen evolution reaction
with an anode (ruthenium/iridium oxide) for the OER with 1.23 V overpotential
as a benchmarking value is used for fixing electrode materials of choice.7 To date, very few reports highlight the use of self-grown
NixSy superstructure
electrocatalysts in OER studies. For example, Zhang et al. obtained
an overpotential of 317 mV for a Ni3S2 electrocatalyst
fabricated by a hydrothermal method.22 Ghim
et al. reported an overpotential of 340 mV for Ni3S2 at 20 mA cm–2.23 Chaudhari et al. noted moderate catalytic activity and stability
of a hydrothermally grown Ni3S2 electrocatalyst
with an overpotential of ∼310 mV.24 Wang et al. claimed an overpotential of 335 mV for Ni3S2 at 50 mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH.25 Most of the published articles include a common
feature, i.e., the use of only one type of Ni3S2 morphology, at one time, that includes nanorods, nanoflakes, nanowires,
nanosheets, etc. In this study, for self-grown NixSy superstructures with different
morphologies for electrocatalytic energy storage applications, we
report a very convenient and scalable self-grown chemical synthesis
approach to obtain the NixSy superstructure electrodes of different morphologies.
After structure, morphology, phase purity, and binding energy measurements,
they are envisaged in water-splitting applications where a low OER
overpotential and a long-term chemical stability are evidenced.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Experimental Procedure
The experimental
procedure has been reported in detail in our previous work.21 In brief, NiF in the presence of different sulfur
source precursors, i.e., sodium thiosulfate (STS), thioacetamide (TAA),
thiourea (TU), sodium sulfide (SS) in 3, 0.45, 6, and 3 g, respectively,
was added sequentially in 50 mL of deionized water as a solvent. The
above-prepared sulfurized solutions were poured in a 50 mL capacity
stainless steel autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 4 h; during
the heating treatment, each sulfur precursor dissociated to sulfur
ions (S2–) (see the detailed chemical reaction in
the Supporting Information S1 (SI), which
successively could react with nickel ions from NiF, resulting in the
formation of the NixSy superstructure (Figure 1). As-prepared self-grown electrocatalysts were labeled as (a) NiF
(for comparison), (b) NixSy–STS, (c) NixSy–TAA, (d) NixSy–TU, and (e) NixSy–SS. All electrocatalyst
electrodes were characterized for their structure, surface morphology,
and binding energy by means of different characterization tools, as
reported previously.21

of in situ, hydrothermally grown NixSy superstructures
with an actual hydrothermal unit.

2.2 OER Confirmation
The OER measurements
for the NixSy electrocatalysts were carried out using a three-electrode system
(in addition to the use of NiF as a reference) in the presence of
a Hg/HgO reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode. Before
undertaking experiments, a nitrogen purge was operated for 10 min
to normalize the system with respect to external as well as internal
oxygen.

2.3 Formulas
Formulas used for estimating
the three-electrode electrocalatalytic energy parameters are provided
in the SI S2.

3 Results
and Discussion
The surface morphologies of the pristine NiF
and self-grown NixSy superstructure
electrodes are displayed in field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM) images shown in Figure 2a–e. The surface of NiF obviously changed after
hydrothermal sulfurization. We selected a single-branch NiF and self-grown
NixSy for
analysis (Figure 2a,a1))
under low and high magnifications. As can be seen, the FE-SEM image
of pristine NiF reflected an uneven, continuous, and smooth surface
of Ni oval-shaped grain boundaries and NixSy superstructure electrodes of different
morphologies, suggesting a role of precursor solution in the growth
process. Figure 2b,b1
confirms the surface of the NixSy–STS electrode as volcano-type nanorods
of 800 (±100) nm heights. The diameter of these nanorods, separated
from one another with open air voids of 200 (±50) nm, dramatically
reduced from the top to bottom in the range of 60 (±20) nm. The
NixSy–TAA
electrode surfaces (Figure 2c,c1), consisting of well-grown and uniformly distributed
nanoflakes with 5 (±1) nm widths and 100 (±30) nm sized
pores, are interlocked into one another. The morphology of NixSy–TU (Figure 2d,d1) presents a
budlike structure with a diameter of 900 (±300) nm and separation
spacing of 1200 (±500) nm (Figure 2e,e1).1

Figure 2 FE-SEM images of NiF
(a, a1) and self-grown NixSy [NixSy–STS (b, b1), NixSy–TAA (c, c1),
NixSy–TU
(d, d1), and NixSy–SS (e, e1)] at different magnifications.

In the end, the NixSy–SS electrode shows less number of 3 (±2)
nm
width nanopetals. In a nutshell, after sulfurizing, NiF with different sulfur precursors can be evaluated
in different NixSy morphologies, which play an important role in easy electrolyte ion
transformation into an interior part of the electrode material when
employed in electrochemical energy storage devices.

Furthermore,
the presence of the Ni and S elements on the NiF,
NixSy–STS,
NixSy–TAA,
NixSy–TU,
and NixSy–SS
surfaces is confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping
analysis (Figure S1). From the results
obtained, it is confirmed that Ni and S followed a uniform distribution
over the NiF surface with an expected atomic percentage; Ni varies
from 100 to 43%, whereas S increases from 0 to 40%, suggesting the
successful incorporation of S2– into NiF as NixSy. With different
methods, trial-and-error
experiments have been carried out to optimize the condition of the
sulfur source, by unoptimizing sulfur precursor weights, with failure
results in terms of not-well-sulfurized FE-SEM images shown in Figure S2. This result confirms that the sulfur
precursor solution source was allowing NiF to withstand without any
breakage during an optimization of the sulfurization process.

The phases present in NixSy were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and selected area electron
diffraction (SEAD) measurements, as given in Figure 3 (A, B, C–E, F–I, J–K,
and L, respectively). NixSy was polycrystalline in nature as the XRD patterns
showed reflection peaks with moderate intensities (Figure 3A). The two strong intensity
peaks (marked as “Δ”) at 44.4 and 51.7° were
due to (111) and (200) reflections, respectively, of NiF (JCPDS no.
04-0850).28 Four new peaks reflected at
18.71° (110), 32.34° (330), 40.74° (021), and 52.01°
(401) were attributed to NiS (denoted “”); three peaks at
31.29° (200), 35.93° (210), and 59.85° (321) were attributed
to NiS2 (denoted “⧫”); and rest five
peaks at 21.29° (101), 30.68° (110), 49.04° (113),
50.43° (210), and 55.33° (112) were attributed to Ni3S2 (denoted “*”). All reflected peaks
evidenced the presence of three different phases in NiF after sulfurization.17−21 Raman modes were generated in the NixSy superstructure. The reflected Raman
peaks were at 142, 246, 298, and 373 cm–1 for NiS;
346, 462, 487, and 557 cm–1 for NiS2;
and 185, 280, and 633 cm–1 for Ni3S2.21,26−38 A single Raman scattering peak was reflected in NiF due to its metallic
character (Figure 3B,a). The presence of numerous peaks in the broad range of 900–1200
cm–1 indicated the existence of sulfate (S2–) ions. An XPS survey scan was carried out to identify the surface
valance states; the Ni 2p and S 2p spectra for the NixSy–STS electrode
are shown in Figure 3C–E (the XPS spectra for the other electrodes are given in Figure S3). Occurrence of Ni and S elements was
clarified from the survey spectrum. The binding energy positions for
Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 were at 855 and 874 eV (shown
in Figure 3D). A pair
of satellite peaks at 860 and 879 eV was also recognized. The peaks
at 162.3 and 169 eV in the high-resolution (HR) XPS spectrum for S
2p (Figure 3E) were
ascribed to 2p1/2 and SO42–, which indicate the presence of the S–S band in all of the
NixSy electrodes
(see Figure S3 for more details for other
electrodes). The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm and
the pore size distribution (inset) graphs for the NixSy–STS electrode are
shown in Figure 3F.
The obtained specific surface area and pore size distribution values
were 62 m2 g–1 and 7.4 nm, respectively.
The adsorption isotherm in the range of 0.4–0.9 with a slope
value ca. 0.4 was allotted to capillary condensation, which is a typical
feature of mesoporous materials.19,21 The obtained
surface area and pore size distribution values for other NixSy electrodes were
smaller (38–47 m2 g–1) and are
given in Figure 3G–I.
The HR-TEM images (Figure 3J) of the optimized NixSy–STS electrode, i.e., the formation of
volcano-type nanorods, which is well consistent with the FE-SEM images
shown in Figure 2b,b1.
The HR-TEM scan, as shown in Figure 3K, revealed interplanar lattice fringe separation distances
of 0.29 and 0.28 nm for the (111) and (200) planes of NiS2 and Ni3S2, respectively. The irregular compact
lattice fringes (dotted circle shown in Figure 3K) could be due to an amorphous NiS, suggesting
the existence of NiS2, Ni3S2, and
NiS separately in NixSy. Interestingly, the SAED image recorded for
the NixSy–STS
electrode in Figure 3L showed bright and circular concentric rings, confirming that it
is nanocrystalline in nature.

Summary of reported overpotential vs Tafel slope values in relation
to the NixSy–STS electrocatalyst. (D) Schematic representation of the
possible reasons to obtain an enhanced electrocatalytic performance
of the electrocatalyst for water splitting.

The NiF and in situ grown NixSy electrocatalysts in comparison with RuO2 were
envisaged for OER water catalysis activity, as shown in Figure 4A, wherein NiF/RuO2 showed a very low/high OER activity, whereas NixSy–STS after sulfurization
showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity at a lower potential of
200 mV relative to the other NixSy and RuO2 electrodes (210, 220, 230,
and 138 mV), indicating an improvement in electrocatalytic activity
for OER after sulfurization. An oxidation peak noted could be due
to the surface reaction of Ni2+ with active Ni3+ species in NixSy.41 The inset in Figure 4A shows an actual photograph of electrocatalytic
OER testing, with marked evolution of oxygen bubbles, which strongly
supported that NixSy is used for OER activity.

Figure 4B shows
the Tafel plots for the corresponding polarization curves, whose slopes
provide information that is favorable for OER activity on the surfaces
of the NixSy electrocatalysts.39−41 With an enhanced OER rate, the slope of the Tafel
plots is reduced from 165 to 138 mV dec–1 for the
NixSy electrocatalyst
(see detailed information about formulas used for calculation in the Supporting Information S2 (SI)). The different
NixSy phases,
three-dimensional (3D) structures, and high surface areas with a minimum
series resistance increased the water splitting rate for better OER
activity. The numerical values obtained for the overpotential and
Tafel slope of the NixSy–STS electrode were in close agreement to those reported
earlier22−25,42−45 (Figure 4C). Figure S4A shows the Nyquist plots obtained for the self-grown and NiF electrodes.
The value for the charge-transfer resistance (in Ω) obtained
for NixSy–STS
was ≈0.40 (±0.10), lower than that for NixSy–TAA (≈0.90
(±0.10)), NixSy–TU (≈1.40 (±0.20)), NixSy–SS (2.10 (±0.10)),
and NiF (≈3.15 (±0.10)) electrodes. The series resistance
values for the NiF and NixSy electrodes were 3.5, 0.5, 1.4, 1.9, and 1.5 Ω,
respectively, meaning a smaller series resistance for the NixSy–STS electrode compared
to that for other electrodes. The cyclability of the NixSy–STS electrocatalyst
for OER was further examined by successive CV plots for 1000 cycles
(Figure S4B and its inset show polarization
curves after 1st and 1000th cycles). A small reduction in the OER
activity was corroborated from the NixSy–STS CV curves after 1000th
polarization curves. Considering the excellent OER catalytic ability
for the 1000 polarization curves, the FE-SEM images of the NixSy–STS electrode
(Figure S4C,D) showed a change in morphology
from volcano-type nanorods to aggregated nanoflakes with more crystallinity,
one of the common practices in electrochemical measurements. The above
result and discussion indicates that NixSy–STS acts as an excellent catalyst
for OER and there are possible reasons (see Figure 4D) that after sulfurization of NiF its surface
area increases with more active sites, wherein OH– intercalation and electron transportation at lower potentials become
much easier. The XRD and XPS analyses after the stability study are
also shown in Figure S5a,b–d. The
XRD pattern of the NixSy–STS electrode shows a strong peak of Ni metal with
a suppressed NixSy peak position due to the formation of an amorphous phase, where,
as shown in the XPS spectrum, peak positions of Ni and S shifted toward
a lower wavelength side with decreased peak intensity; both elements were decreasing the presence
in the NixSy–STS electrode except the O peak.

4 Conclusions
Self-grown 3D NixSy superstructures comprising NiS, NiS2, and Ni3S2 crystal structures with different morphologies
and high surface areas have been successfully prepared using a hydrothermal
method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties
of NixSy confirm
an excellent catalysis performance as compared to that of the pristine
NiF. On a similar line, efforts for self-growing NixSey and NixTey together with MoS, Fe (iron),
V (vanadate), and their hybrid superstructures with varying morphologies
for better and sustainable electrochemical and electrocatalytic energy
storage performance are underway.46−49
