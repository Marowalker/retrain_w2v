The widespread industrial use of H2O2 has
provoked great interest in the development of new and more efficient
materials for its detection. Enzymatic electrochemical sensors have
drawn particular attention, primarily because of their excellent selectivity.
However, their high cost, instability, complex immobilization, and
inherent tendency toward denaturation of the enzyme significantly
limit their practical usefulness. Inspired by the powerful proton-catalyzed
H2O2 reduction mechanism of peroxidases, we
have developed a well-defined and densely functionalized carboxylic
graphene derivative (graphene acid, GA) that serves as a proton source
and conductive electrode for binding and detecting H2O2. An unprecedented H2O2 sensitivity
of 525 μA cm–2 mM–1 is achieved
by optimizing the balance between the carboxyl group content and scaffold
conductivity of GA. Importantly, the GA sensor greatly outperforms
all reported carbon-based H2O2 sensors and is
superior to enzymatic ones because of its simple immobilization, low
cost, and uncompromised sensitivity even after continuous operation
for 7 days. In addition, GA-based sensing electrodes remain highly
selective in the presence of interferents such as ascorbic acid, paracetamol,
and glucose, as well as complex matrices such as milk. GA-based sensors
thus have considerable potential for use in practical industrial sensing
technologies.

Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is widely used in
industry; its worldwide production has been projected to reach 6 ×
106 tons by 2024, making it among the 100 most important
bulk chemicals.1,2 Sectors that use H2O2 extensively include the textile, pulp, paper, semiconductor,
food, and cosmetic industries. However, H2O2 is cytotoxic,3 so its presence in commercial
products is strictly monitored. Indicative concentration limits range
from 12% for hair care products to 0.1% for oral hygiene commodities,
and zero-tolerance in food products.4 Moreover,
3–10 wt % solutions of H2O2 in water
are used around the world as an antiseptic. Consequently, there is
a growing demand for simple, fast, sensitive, and inexpensive sensors
for H2O2 detection.

Conventional spectroscopic
techniques such as spectrophotometry,5−8 fluorescence spectroscopy,9−11 and chemiluminescence spectroscopy12−16 are highly sensitive but require complex and expensive
instrumentation
and long detection times. Moreover, spectrophotometric techniques
are often incompatible with real samples containing dispersed particles
or dissolved species that may scatter or absorb light, affecting the
measurement. In contrast, electrochemical methods could potentially
enable simple, rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective H2O2 detection, avoiding the major drawbacks of spectroscopic
methods.17−20 In principle, electrochemical H2O2 detection
could be achieved using a conventional solid-state electrode such
as the glassy carbon electrode (GCE). However, this approach is limited
by high redox overpotentials and a lack of selectivity, leading to
inaccurate determination of H2O2 in real samples.
These issues are exacerbated when other electroactive species are
present (e.g., ascorbate, urate, glucose, paracetamol, or bilirubin).
Therefore, there is an ongoing effort to rationally design new materials
for H2O2 detection that combine sensitivity,
selectivity, and favorable kinetics with a long life cycle and cost-effectiveness.

One of the most successful approaches resulting from this effort
relies on the modification of electrodes with enzymes.21 Because most active sites in enzymes are highly
specific for their target reactions, enzymatic sensors are generally
very selective. However, they have notable drawbacks including relatively
high costs, instability toward variation in temperature and pH, complicated
immobilization procedures, and an inherent tendency toward denaturation
of the enzyme,22 which hinders their commercial
application. Because of these limitations, there is growing interest
in non-enzymatic alternatives, many of which incorporate nanostructured
metals and metal oxides or hybrids thereof with carbon nanomaterials.23 Carbon materials are widely used in electrochemistry
because of their low cost, wide potential window, high stability,
conductivity, and remarkable selectivity for diverse redox reactions,
including CO2 and O2 reduction.24−34 Their potential as electrochemical sensors is enhanced by their
ready modification (in contrast to metal electrodes) and high surface
area, which favors analyte adsorption and accumulation.24,35

Both carbon nanotubes (CNTs)36−39 and graphene1,40−43 have thus been used as electrodes for electrochemical H2O2 detection. For example, a H2O2 electrosensor based on chemically reduced graphene oxide (CR-GO)41 reportedly outperformed both CNTs41 and a bare GCE.40 Moreover, the CR-GO system was able to operate at concentrations
between 0.05 and 1500 μmol with a sensitivity of 82.35 μA
cm–2 mM–1. While GO must be reduced
to convert it from an insulator into a conductor, reduction changes
the material’s property in some undesirable ways, by increasing
its hydrophobicity and removing functional groups. This increases
its tendency to aggregate and limits its solvation in water and accessibility
to analyte molecules.44,45 To circumvent these problems,
Woo et al.46 used MWCNTs as bridges and
pillars separating the graphene sheets, creating a conductive network
and preventing their aggregation. However, the resulting sensor exhibited
a lower sensitivity (32.91 μA cm–2 mM–1) than the original CR-GO system, probably because
the surface hydrophobicity and the lack of chemical functionalities
for binding H2O2 were not adequately addressed.
In another attempt to boost the performance of GO-based electrosensors,
Wang et al.47 covalently grafted tyrosine
onto GO and simultaneously reduced it by heating at 100 °C for
24 h with no added conjugation agents. The resulting material had
a wide linear H2O2 detection range (100 to 2100
μM), a detection limit of 80 μM, and a sensitivity of
69.07 μA cm–2 mM–1, which
was still lower than that of pristine CR-GO.

Heteroatom doping
offers another way for improving the performance
of graphene-based H2O2 sensors. Boron-doped
graphene nanosheets were recently reported as carbon-based catalysts
for H2O2 detection with a superior sensitivity
of 266.7 μA cm–2 mM–1. However,
while their linear range is wide (1000–20,000 μM), its
lower bound is very high.48 The development
of carbon-based catalysts for H2O2 sensing is
probably hampered by the dense but uncontrolled functionalization
of GO,49 which makes it an insulator, and
by the low reactivity of pristine graphene.50,51 Overcoming these challenges will require an up-scalable product
combining hydrophilicity with conductivity and selective functionalization
for enhanced binding and reduction of H2O2.
This could be achieved through controlled derivatization that avoids
functional groups that do not contribute to sensing and thus reduce
the graphene system’s conductivity without providing any commensurate
benefit.

Based on these considerations and the proton-catalyzed
H2O2 reduction mechanism of peroxidases,52 we propose a selectively and densely functionalized
carboxylic
graphene derivative (graphene acid,53 GA)
as a two-dimensional proton source and conductive electrode for binding
and detecting H2O2. Whereas GO synthesis requires
concentrated acids and strong oxidizers, GA is prepared under mild
conditions that preserve the graphene sheets’ conductivity
and avoid introducing functionalities that are not useful for H2O2 sensing. These properties were exploited to
develop a GA-based electrochemical H2O2 sensor
with sensitivity as high as 525 μA cm–2 mM–1, setting a new benchmark in the field (see Table S1 for detailed comparisons). Analyses
with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) precluded
any metal impurity-induced activity. Remarkably, the GA-based sensor’s
sensitivity surpassed that of enzymatic sensors54 while remaining stable even after a week of continuous
operation. It was also very robust, retaining high sensitivity and
selectivity for H2O2 in the presence of interferents
such as ascorbic acid, paracetamol, and glucose, or when tested in
complex matrices such as milk.

Results and Discussion
GA was synthesized from fluorographene
(FG), a stable, stoichiometric,
and well-defined graphene derivative, which was subjected to nucleophilic
substitution with NaCN, yielding fluorine-free G-CN with 15% nitrile
group coverage.53 The −CN groups
were then quite selectively converted into −COOH groups by
acid hydrolysis with HNO3, yielding densely functionalized
GA.53 By varying the concentration of HNO3 in the acid hydrolysis step, GA samples with varying carboxyl
contents (GA1, GA2, and GA3) were obtained. Pristine G-CN displayed
a pronounced IR band at 2207 cm–1 (Figure 1A, spectrum i) due to the triple
bond of the covalently attached C≡N groups. Upon treatment
with 20% HNO3, the C≡N band disappeared, indicating
the replacement of the nitrile groups with carboxyls (GA1, Figure 1, spectrum ii). Raising
the acid concentration during the hydrolysis step to 40% (GA2) or
65% (GA3) increased the content of −COOH groups, as indicated
by the increasing intensity of the band at 1726 cm–1 (Figure 1A, spectra
ii–iv). The increasing −COOH content in the GA1–GA3
samples also affected the C=C bands (aromatic ring stretching
vibrations),55,56 which appeared at 1580 cm–1 in the G-CN spectrum. Specifically, as the −COOH
content increased, the aromaticity and extent of conjugation decreased,
leading to a shift of the band to 1607 cm–1. The
broad band with maximum intensity centered at 1233 cm–1 is ascribed to in-plane carbon ring and carboxyl vibrations.57

Atomic compositions retrieved from XPS survey analysis
showed that
acid hydrolysis reduced the samples’ content of nitrogen and
increased that of oxygen (Figure 1B). HR-XPS data for the C 1s region also indicated
that the increasing O content was attributable to carboxyl-type carbons
because of the very characteristic component evolving at 288.7 eV
(Figure 1C and inset).58 Additionally, the C≡N component (highlighted
in gray in the inset of Figure 1C) of G-CN was absent in the spectra of GA1, GA2, and GA3,
all of which had near-identical C≡N regions. This corroborated
the IR data, suggesting that almost all nitrile groups hydrolyzed,
even in GA1. The O and N contents in the G-CN and GA samples are probably
due to the side reactions during the synthesis of G-CN from FG, which
is performed in DMF at 130 °C; at this temperature, DMF decomposes
into amines that are reactive toward FG.53 The O 1s region of the deconvoluted HR-XPS spectrum of the GA1 sample
(Figure 1D) contains
two main components (the third minor one is ascribed to chemisorbed
O2 and H2O). The main components in GA1 are
almost equal in area, which is in agreement with the presence of O=C—OH
(carboxyl) groups.59 While acidic hydrolysis
of the nitrile groups with HNO3 led to a relatively selective
carboxylation in sample GA1, the higher HNO3 concentrations
used to prepare GA2 and GA3 induced less selective oxidation of the
graphene skeleton, as indicated by the increasing —C=O
over the −C–OH component (Figure 1D) and the additional C=O IR bands
indicated by asterisks in Figure 1A.

The quality of the sheets in samples GA1–GA3
was probed
by HR-TEM (Figure 2A–C and insets). The use of nitric acid concentrations above
that required for selective nitrile hydrolysis apparently reduced
the graphene skeleton’s integrity: GA2 and GA3 had more small
fragments of material and defects than GA1 (Figure 2B,C and insets).The HAADF-STEM image and
elemental mapping of carbon and oxygen in the GA1 sample (Figure 2D–G) clearly
show the homogeneous and dense atomic distribution of oxygen on its
sheets. The higher quality flake structure of the GA1 sample was further
probed with scanning electron microscopy (Figure S1).

The electrocatalytic properties of the GA derivatives
were evaluated
by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in Ar-saturated PBS buffer solution at
pH 7.0 because H2O2 is less readily detected
at neutral pH than under basic or acidic conditions, making for a
more stringent and practically relevant test of performance.60 In all the three investigated cases, an anodic/cathodic
couple of broad peaks was detected that was attributed to the redox
processes of the carboxyl groups, according to the results described
in Figure S3. A significant decline in
current density was observed upon moving from GA1 to GA3 (Figure 3A), in agreement
with the previous data, regarding the lower aromatic character and
sheet quality of GA2 and GA3, since both factors would tend to reduce
conductivity. All GA samples exhibited a stronger cathodic current
density in the presence of the H2O2 analyte
(Figure 3B–D),
with an onset potential of −0.15 V after the addition of 5
mM H2O2. This suggested that all GAs were active
in H2O2 reduction and thus detection. Nevertheless,
the CV scans showed that the current density response at −0.4
V for GA1 (−627 μA cm–2) was much stronger
than that for GA2 (−231 μA cm–2) or
GA3 (−53 μA cm–2). This confirmed the
importance of mild acid treatment (i.e., selective nitrile group hydrolysis).
Interestingly, the current density response upon H2O2 addition using GO was marginal, as shown by the very small
increase of current density in the CVs upon addition of H2O2 (Figure S2A).

and in the presence of 5 mM H2O2. The insets
in panels (B)–(D) show tentative structures of the GA1–GA3
products. All CVs were recorded in 0.10 M PBS buffer solution at pH
7.0 under Ar at a scan rate of 0.05 V s–1.

To better understand the electrochemical properties
of GA electrodes,
we performed EIS measurements using an optimized Nafion-based ink
containing the GA samples. The instability of the GA3 ink caused the
detachment from the electrode and the leaching in the aqueous solution,
preventing its characterization. This was probably due to the very
high hydrophilicity of GA3, which resulted from its high content of
oxygen groups and defects, as well as its comparatively small flake
size (Figure 2C). Based
on the Nyquist plots for GA1 and GA2 (Figure 4A) and the corresponding equivalent circuit
(EC) used to fit the EIS data, the GA1-modified electrode exhibited
a charge-transfer resistance of 8 Ω cm2, three times
lower than that of GA2 (Table S2), confirming
the importance of conductivity for imparting high performance. In
control experiments, the non-carboxylated GA precursor (G-CN) exhibited
a worse H2O2 sensing performance with respect
to GA1 (Figure S3) despite its higher conductivity,
as previously reported.61 The latter is
also evidenced here from the lower charge-transfer resistance (R1 = 5 Ω cm2, as simulated from
the EIS data in Figure 4A and Table S2) than that of GA1. G-CN
also demonstrated lower stability of the response (Figure S4) and a narrower linear range, being unable to operate
at concentrations below 0.1 mM H2O2. The electrochemical
response of the GA-CN product treated with a lower amount of HNO3 than the GA1 and thus being a mixed-functionalized graphene
carrying both −CN and −COOH groups (see IR spectra in Figure S3 inset) was also inferior to GA’s
response (Figure S3). These results demonstrated the key role of −COOH
groups tethered onto a sufficiently conductive substrate. Indeed,
catalytic H2O2 reduction by enzymes (i.e., peroxidases)
is triggered by the supply of protons from amino acid residues in
the enzyme’s H2O2 binding pocket, together
with electron injection from sacrificial donors.52

and GA2 (blue line) using a rotating disk electrode in an Ar-saturated

circuit used for fitting where Rs is the
solution resistance, and the subsequent (resistor, constant phase
element, CPE) components are associated with the charge-transfer resistance
in parallel with the double layer capacitance (R1, CPE1) and the resistance related to diffusion processes
(R2, CPE2 and R3, CPE3). The right inset shows a magnification of the high frequency
part of the Nyquist plot where the charge-transfer processes take
place. (B–D) Optimized structures of complexes of graphene
derivatives (in water) (B, GA; C, G-CN; and D, GO) with H2O2. The hydrogen bonds between H2O2 and graphene functional groups are indicated by yellow dashed lines.
The interaction energies in kcal mol–1 between H2O2 and graphene derivatives are stated below each
structure.

Furthermore, DFT calculations (Figure 4B–D) indicated that
H2O2 binds more tightly to GA (−21.5
kcal mol–1) than to GCN (−10.2 kcal mol–1) or GO (−15.5
kcal mol–1) because strong hydrogen bonds are formed
between the OH groups of H2O2 and the carboxylate
groups of GA. It should be highlighted that ICP-MS analyses confirmed
that metal impurities in the GA1 product are not responsible for any
catalytic activity (see Table S3 for results
and discussion).

To further evaluate the sensing performance
of GA1, we conducted
chronoamperometry measurements at −0.4 V versus SCE by sequentially
adding 20 μL portions of a 50 mM H2O2 solution
to a 10 mL 0.1 M PBS solution (Figure 5A). The value −0.4 V versus SCE was chosen as
the working potential as it produced the best response from the sensor
in terms of sensitivity and the linear range. Calibration plots for
the three samples derived from chronoamperometry data revealed a linear
relationship between the current density and the H2O2 concentration over the investigated range (Figure 5B). The obtained values reflect
the previously observed trend, with GA1 displaying the highest average
sensitivity (525 ± 105 μA cm–2 mM–1), while GA2 and GA3 showed progressively worse performance,
with average sensitivities of 94 ± 25 and 40 ± 9 μA
cm–2 mM–1, respectively. The high
sensitivity of GA1, exceeding that of GA3 by more than one order of
magnitude, correlated with its excellent electron transfer properties,
which resulted from the optimized synthetic protocol. By repeating
the experiment with different concentration windows, we estimated
the sensor’s linear range; H2O2 could
be detected with the quoted sensitivities at concentrations between
20 and 2000 μM, making GA-based sensors potentially suitable
for several biological and industrial applications. Remarkably, the
sensitivity of GA1 substantially exceeded that of other recently reported
graphene-based sensors:43,46,47 it was twice that of the previous record holder (B-doped graphene,48 with a sensitivity of 266 μA cm–2 mM–1) and even higher than some enzymatic systems.54 A detailed comparison of the performance of
state-of-the-art carbon-based sensors is available in Table S1.

responses presented in panel (A) for GA1 (black dots), GA2 (red dots),
and GA3 (blue dots). The red line is the linear fit to the data and

of GA1 at −0.4 V showing sequential 40 μL additions of
50 mM solutions of H2O2, ascorbic acid (AA),
glucose (Glu), and paracetamol (Par).

GA1 was tested further under conditions more closely
resembling
real applications to validate its reproducibility/stability, selectivity,
and robustness when exposed to real, complex matrices. Its reproducibility
and stability in the presence of possible H2O2 degradation products such as oxygen radicals were evaluated by performing
amperometric tests at −0.4 V for 7 consecutive days during
which its average sensitivity remained unchanged.

Another crucial
determinant of a H2O2 sensor’s
reliability is its response to interference by oxidizable compounds
commonly present in commercial samples such as ascorbic acid, glucose,
and paracetamol. Figure 5C shows the amperometric response of GA1 to H2O2 in the presence of these three compounds. The current density increased
steeply after the addition of H2O2, but no such
increase followed the addition of the interfering substances, demonstrating
the high selectivity of GA1 for H2O2. The general
robustness and reliability of the GA1 sensor was then evaluated in
a realistic test case by adding commercial milk to the electrolyte
solution while performing chronoamperometry tests. Milk was chosen
because H2O2 is widely used in dairy production
to inhibit microbial proliferation and milk spoilage and its concentration
must be strictly monitored for safety reasons. Milk is also a complex
mixture of different compounds, and it is a particularly demanding
system for benchmarking H2O2 sensors. Strikingly,
the current density response remained utterly unaffected by the addition
of milk (Figure S5). These results clearly
showed that GA is a promising candidate for sensitive, selective,
cheap, and reliable H2O2 sensors suitable for
the testing of commercial products bearing complex matrices.

Conclusions
We demonstrated that graphene acid, a selectively
carboxylated
and conductive graphene derivative, acts as a carbon-based catalyst
for the electroreduction and detection of H2O2 whose sensitivity (525 μA cm–2 mM–1) markedly exceeds that of all previously reported carbon-based sensors
and competes even that of enzymatic ones. However, unlike the delicate
enzymatic sensors, GA’s sensitivity remained uncompromised
over a week of a continuous operation. This unprecedented performance
is attributable to its stable carbon-based all-covalent nature, the
high affinity of carboxyl groups for H2O2 (as
revealed by DFT calculations), and their abundance in the material,
which enables the efficient proton-assisted H2O2 electroreduction. When tested in realistic scenarios featuring interfering
species and complex matrices such as milk, the graphene-acid electrosensor
exhibited high selectivity and retained its sensitivity. Given the
material’s proven biocompatibility53 and the availability of a high-yielding and scalable synthetic protocol,
these results may pave the way to the development of a previously
unexplored class of carbon-based non-enzymatic commercial sensors
for H2O2 detection.

Experimental Section
Reagents, Materials, and Methods
Nafion 117 solution
(5 wt %), NaCN (p.a. ≥97%), and graphite fluoride (>61 wt
%
F, C1F1.1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Acetone (pure) and ethanol (absolute) were purchased from Penta. Amine-free
dimethylformamide (DMF) and nitric acid (Analpure, 65%) were obtained
from Lach-Ner. All aqueous solutions were prepared with ultrapure
water (18 MΩ cm–1).

Synthesis of Cyanographene (Precursor of GA)
Cyanographene
(G-CN) was synthesized according to previously reported procedures,
with small modifications (see Supporting Information).53

Synthesis of Graphene Acid Samples
Nitric acid was
added to aqueous suspensions of G-CN to achieve final HNO3 concentrations of 5, 20, 40, or 65 wt % (for GA-CN, GA1, GA2, and
GA3, respectively), and the resulting suspensions were heated at 100
°C with stirring (500 rpm) for 24 h. For the case of GA-CN, reflux
was applied for 30 min. The product was isolated and washed with H2O by centrifugation. When it stopped precipitating after a
few washing steps, acidic water (pH = 4) was used to protonate the
material and reduce its dispersibility, inducing precipitation. Finally,
dialysis was applied to obtain stable aqueous suspensions of GA1,
GA2, and GA3 with a final pH of ∼3.2 and a suspension conductivity
of ∼150 μS cm–1. It is noted that GA1
was synthesized according to ref (53).

Electrochemical Techniques
Electrochemical tests were
performed at room temperature using an Autolab 302 N electrochemical
workstation (Metrohm). The cell setup was a three-electrode system
with a Pt wire as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode
(SCE) that was separated from the solution by a bridge equipped with
a Vycor frit as the reference electrode, and a GCE modified with the
prepared electrocatalysts as the working electrode. The GCE was polished
with 1.0 and 0.3 μm alumina powders (Buehler MicroPolish) and
rinsed thoroughly with deionized water. The electrode was then dried
at 60 °C. The ink (10 μL) prepared from the different materials
was then drop-cast on a clean GCE and dried in an oven at 60 °C
for 30 min. The inks were prepared at a concentration of 2.5 mg mL–1 using Nafion 1 wt % in a 50:50 ethanol/water solution.
The average sensitivity for each sample was determined by repeating
the experiment multiple times. For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurements, see the Supporting Information.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
To model
the interaction of H2O2 with graphene derivatives,
we used finite size models based on functionalized ovalene (C32H14) with a degree of functionalization of 12.5%.
Consequently, the GA, GCN, and GO models contained four carboxylate
groups, four nitrile groups, and one epoxy and two hydroxyl groups,
respectively (cf. Figure 4B–D). All geometries were optimized using the ωB97xd62 long-range corrected hybrid density functional
with dispersion correction and Dunning’s correlation-consistent
polarized double-ζ basis sets (cc-pVDZ).63 The surrounding water was modeled using the polarizable
solvation model (SMD).64 We considered
several starting geometries of the H2O2···GA
complexes and selected the most stable for further analysis. The interaction
energies (Eint) between H2O2 and graphene derivatives were calculated as Eint = E(complex) – E(H2O2) – E(graphene
derivative).
