To
cleave biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) from the mono-ion
complex (MIC) for sustainable cellular uptake in vivo, ω-amide-pentylimidazolium
end-modified PEG with an ester bond, that is, APe-Im-E-PEG, has been
synthesized. The hydrolysis of the resulting APe-Im-E-PEG proceeded
during the incubation for 2 weeks under physiological conditions,
which was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography. APe-Im-E-PEG
formed the MIC with plasmid DNA (pDNA), assessed by agarose gel retardation
assay. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering measurement and transmission
electron microscopy observations have estimated that the particle
size of the resulting MIC was approximately 30 nm, with a rather flexible
structure. The APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC incubated for 2 weeks exhibited
hemolytic activity at endosomal pH, presumably because the pH-sensitive
carboxyl groups revealed after the hydrolysis of an ester bond of
APe-Im-E-PEG. The APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC enhanced the gene expression
2 weeks after transfection in vivo by intramuscular administration
in mice. Consequently, in vivo sustainable gene expression has been
achieved by the molecular design of APe-Im-E-PEG for cellular uptake
and endosomal escape proceeded by temporal hydrolysis of the ester
bond.

==== Body
Introduction
Plasmid DNAs (pDNAs)
have the advantage to produce many therapeutic
proteins by translation as well as many therapeutic RNAs by transcription.1−3 For clinical application, the gene expression from pDNA should be
preserved in vivo, resulting in sustainable production of therapeutic
proteins as well as RNAs.4−6 Accordingly, the strategy design
for in vivo sustainable gene expression is considered to be important
target in the field of pDNA delivery to disease site of bedside patients.

In the field of pDNA delivery system, various polyion complexes
(PICs) between pDNA and polycations by electrostatic interaction are
widely used for pDNA transfection in vitro,7,8 including
us,9−14 and in vivo.15,16 Especially, in vivo pDNA delivery
systems incorporate poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to enhance the biocompatibility
of PICs, such as retention in a living body for sustainable protection
from pDNA degradation in vivo.17−19

Recently, to overcome the
structural properties of PICs, such as
a tendency for large particle size by cross-linking between polycations
and pDNAs, we have reported the concept of mono-ion complex (MIC)
between our original monocationic PEG and pDNA.20 As a stabilized MIC by hydrogen bond with an adenine base
in adenine–thymine base pair of pDNA, we have already designed
ω-amide-pentylimidazolium end-modified PEG, i.e., APe-Im-PEG.21

Including our MIC, although the incorporation
of PEG enhances the
biocompatibility to suppress nonspecific interaction with mainly serum
proteins, the resulting PEG shielding often blocks the accessibility
to target cells. The trade-off problem is known as PEG dilemma.22,23 Accordingly, various strategies for overcoming the PEG dilemma are
reported such as cleavage of PEG from the delivery system.24 The cleavable PEGylation is triggered by several
kinds of mechanisms such as the acidolysis of a hydrazine group in
tumor interstitial fluid, endosomes, and lysosomes,25−27 the hydrolyze
of an ester bond in extracellular microenvironment,28−30 the enzymolysis
of a peptide bond in extracellular matrix,31−33 or the thiolysis
of a disulfide bond in intracellular cytoplasm.34−36

In this
study, to overcome the PEG dilemma to access target cells
in spite of pDNA protection for in vivo sustainable gene expression,
we have designed ω-amide-pentylimidazolium end-modified PEG
with an ester bond to be gradually hydrolyzed for sustainable cellular
uptake, i.e., APe-Im-E-PEG (Figure 1). Furthermore, the hydrolyze of an ester bond in this
study is designed to produce a pH-sensitive carboxyl group on the
side of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC for endosomal escape.37,38 The resulting de-PEGylated MIC with pH sensitivity is therefore
expected to achieve sustainable gene expression from pDNA in vivo.

poly(ethylene glycol) with an ester bond (APe-Im-E-PEG) for in vivo
sustainable gene expression.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Stability of APe-Im-E-PEG
Figure 1 shows the
synthesis scheme
of APe-Im-E-PEG to form the MIC with pDNA for in vivo sustainable
gene expression. To resolve the PEG dilemma,22,23 we have introduced an ester bond between ω-amide-pentylimidazolium
(APe-Im) and PEG. The hydrolysis of the ester bond is expected to
dissociate PEG from the MIC for sustainable cellular uptake. To proceed
to endosomal escape;37,38 furthermore, we have adjusted
the direction of the ester bond to produce a pH-sensitive carboxyl
group on the side of the MIC after the hydrolysis. The resulting carboxyl
group is expected to disturb the endosomal membrane under acidic pH
conditions inside the endosome for the promotion of cytoplasmic delivery.

The synthesis scheme of APe-Im-E-PEG is shown in Figure 2. First, we reacted α-succinimidyloxysuccinyl-ω-methoxy,
polyoxyethylene (NHS-E-PEG) with 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole, resulting
in imidazole end-modified PEG (Im-E-PEG). Im-E-PEG was subsequently
reacted with 6-bromohexaneamide for alkylation to synthesize a quaternary
imidazole group of PEG. Final product yield was approximately 25%.
The 1H NMR spectrum indicated the signal of a ω-amide-pentyl
group (APe), a propylene imidazolium group (Im), and a succinyl PEG
(E-PEG) (see Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information). From the suitable signal ratio, we have successfully
synthesized ω-amide-pentylimidazolium end-modified PEG with
an ester bond, i.e., APe-Im-E-PEG.

Figure 2 Synthesis scheme of APe-Im-E-PEG.

Hydrolysis Properties of
APe-Im-E-PEG
Figure 3 shows whether APe-Im-E-PEG
was hydrolyzed under physiological (pH 7.4) or acidic (pH 5.0) conditions
by gel filtration chromatography (GFC). During the incubation for
2 weeks at pH 7.4, the retention time (RT) of imidazolium detected
by absorbance (ABS) at 300 nm was gradually delayed; namely, the peak
at RT of 9.95 min was gradually increased compared with that at RT
of 9.00 min (Figure 3a). Conversely, during incubation at pH 5.0, the imidazolium peak
ratio of RT of 9.95 min to RT of 9.00 min was almost constant (Figure 3b). Furthermore,
the peak at RT of 9.53 min was detected by refractive index (RI),
which was not observed by the detection of ABS at 300 nm, was gradually
increased compared with that at RT of 9.00 during incubation for 2
weeks at pH 7.4 (Figure 3c and see Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information). From these results, APe-Im-E-PEG is considered to be
gradually hydrolyzed under physiological pH conditions to produce
an imidazolium moiety with ABS at 300 nm and a PEG without ABS.

at 300 nm and (c) refractive index (RI). Conditions: 37 °C at
pH 7.4 (a, c) and pH 5.0 (b).

pH-Dependent Hemolytic Activity of APe-Im-E-PEG
To
examine the pH-dependent hemolytic activity of the produced carboxyl
groups after the hydrolysis of APe-Im-E-PEG, we first examined the
native cytotoxicity of APe-Im-E-PEG before hydrolysis (Figure 4a) because the cytotoxicity
of APe-Im-E-PEG is an important factor for clinical applications.
The overall cytotoxicity of free APe-Im-E-PEG and polycations is higher
than that of the corresponding complexes. Therefore, we choose the
cytotoxicity assay of the free APe-Im-E-PEG and polycations to give
a worst-case estimate of the interaction of APe-Im-E-PEG and polycations
with cells rather than that of the MIC and PICs with pDNA. APe-Im-E-PEG
maintained almost 100% cell viability after one day incubation with
human cell line (HepG2) as a representative human cell for future
clinical application in spite of the existence of a cationic group
in the polymer. Conversely, poly(l-lysine) (PLL) and branched
poly(ethylenimine) (b-PEI) with primary ammonium groups decreased
cell viability in view of the same molar concentration of cationic
groups. These results are consistent with our previous study that
dimethyl imidazolium groups were noncytotoxic species as compared
to PLL and b-PEI.39 Because of a kind of
imidazolium group, therefore, the ω-amide-pentylimidazolium
is considered to be a noncytotoxic cation.

on cell viability: (●) APe-Im-E-PEG;
(▲) PLL; and (⧫) b-PEI. Symbols and error bars represent
the mean and standard deviation of the measurements made in triplicate
wells. (b) Effect of pH on the hemolytic activity of APe-Im-E-PEG
incubated for 1 week or 2 weeks at 37 °C: pH 7.4 (gray bars)
or pH 5.0 (black bars). The released hemoglobin (Hb) was determined
by measuring the absorbance at 577 nm.

Then, the hemolytic activity was examined by mixing erythrocytes
and APe-Im-E-PEG, incubated for 1 week or 2 weeks under physiological
conditions, in the isotonic buffer at pH 7.4 or pH 5.0 (Figure 4b). At pH 7.4, no increase
in the absorbance at 577 nm, from hemoglobin release, occurred when
the erythrocytes were mixed with APe-Im-E-PEG incubated for 2 weeks.
On the other hand, hemoglobin release was significantly increased
at pH 5.0 (see Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information) as the incubation time for hydrolysis of APe-Im-E-PEG
increased from 0 day to 2 weeks. These results suggest that the pH-dependent
carboxyl groups were produced after the hydrolysis of APe-Im-E-PEG
to induce the hemolytic activity by the protonated carboxyl groups
at pH 5.0. The resulting hemolytic activity is considered to promote
endosomal escape by the cell (endosome) membrane disruption inside
late endosome at pH 5.0.40

Formation of
the pDNA MIC with APe-Im-E-PEG
To prove
the MIC formation of the resulting APe-Im-E-PEG with pDNA, we carried
out agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 5a). The migration of supercoiled pDNA band
was almost completely retarded above the [ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA ratio of 16, suggesting the formation of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC.
The retardation properties, which did not exist at the loading site,
are considered to be characteristic of the MIC with a negative ζ-potential
(Figure 5b: right vertical
axis). Especially, the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MICs, mixed with the above
([ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA) in the positive/negative charge ratio
of 16, have a small particle size below 30 nm (Figure 5b).

indicates the site where each sample was loaded. (b) Particle size
and ζ-potential of APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC. The mixing positive/negative
charge ratios are also indicated.

As shown in Figure 6, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations reveal
that
pDNA tends to condense when the mixing ratio of APe-Im-E-PEG to pDNA
increased from the positive/negative charge ratio of 1 to that of
32. However, it should be noted that the morphology of the pDNA in
the MIC seems to be less condensed and not spherical, suggesting a
flexible structure.

positive/negative (+/−) charge ratios of APe-Im-E-PEG to pDNA

Formation Stability of
the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC
From
the standpoint of pDNA delivery based on the MIC by monovalent ionic
interaction, to confirm the formation stability of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA
MIC, we examined the release of pDNA from the MIC by competitive exchange
with dextran sulfate as a polyanion (see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Namely, the agarose gel
electrophoresis for the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC mixed at the positive/negative
charge ratio of 1, 16, or 32 was carried out in the presence of dextran
sulfates. Although almost no difference between naked pDNA and MIC
was observed at the mixing charge ratio of 1, the MIC bands were retained
at the mixing charge ratio of 16 or 32, not depending on the concentration
of dextran sulfate. From these results, in spite of monovalent ionic
interaction, APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC at higher mixing charge ratios
is considered to be stable against competitive exchange with polyanion
by multivalent ionic interaction. Furthermore, to check the stability
of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC in serum protein, we carried out the
agarose gel electrophoresis of the MIC in the presence of fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (see Figure S5 in the Supporting
Information). The MIC bands were retained at the mixing charge ratio
of 16 or 32, suggesting negligible reaction of the ester bond with
the amino groups of protein.

From the viewpoint of overcoming
the PEG dilemma, to monitor the size and the surface charge, as well
as pDNA condensation degree before and after hydrolysis, we carried
out the agarose gel electrophoresis of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC incubated
for 2 weeks (see Figure S6 in the Supporting
Information). As the incubation time increased up to 2 weeks, the
MIC bands at the mixing charge ratio of 16 or 32 were further migrated
and not apparently stained by ethidium bromide (EtBr). These results
suggest that the appearance of the anionic carboxyl group on the side
of the MIC after hydrolysis promoted the further migration into the
plus pole of the gel. Also, the cleavage of expanded PEG is considered
to induce the coil–globule transition of pDNA, resulting in
the inhibition of the EtBr intercalation.11

In Vivo Sustainable Gene Expression Mediated by the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA
MIC
According to the stability of the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC,
we finally checked whether MIC mediated the sustainable gene expression.
As shown in Figure 7, we determined the gene expression from the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC
injected into the skeletal muscle after 1 week or 2 weeks. In case
of intramuscular administration, naked pDNAs are used for some clinical
trials to mediate significant gene expression.41−43 The gene expression
mediated by naked pDNA lowered up to 25% from 1 week to 2 week after
transfection. As compared to naked pDNA 1 week after transfection,
approximately 5 times higher gene expression was obtained by the MIC
at the mixing charge ratio of 32. However, after 2 weeks, the resulting
gene expression reduced up to 20% level from 1 week after transfection.

Figure 7 Transfection
activity of luciferase gene into the skeletal muscles
injected by the APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA MIC at [ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA ratios (charge ratio: +/−) of 1–32 after 1 week (gray
bars) or 2 weeks (black bars). Gene expression was determined as relative
light unit (RLU) normalized by the protein concentration. Symbols
and error bars represent the mean and standard deviation. Statistical
significance (p < 0.05) is indicated when compared
to the naked pDNA (n = 6).

At the mixing charge ratio of 16, the gene expression mediated
by the MIC was 1.5 times higher than that mediated by naked pDNA 1
week after transfection. At 2 week post-transfection, notably, the
gene expression mediated by MIC was 8.5 times higher than that mediated
by naked pDNA (p < 0.05). Namely, it is worth
noting that the resulting gene expression rose by 50% from 1 week
to 2 weeks after transfection. These results suggest that APe-Im-E-PEG/pDNA
MIC at the mixing charge ratio of 16 was an optimum structure for
in vivo sustainable gene expression under these experimental conditions.
The reason why the mixing charge ratio of 16 showed a more sustainable
gene expression may be homogeneity of the MIC with small particle
size below 30 nm, in spite of no significant difference of morphology
in the TEM images, because the MIC with large particle size may be
partially formed by accidental aggregation due to a large number of
APe-Im-E-PEG at the mixing charge ratio of 32. Collectively, although
details of the mechanisms are now under investigation, APe-Im-E-PEG
is considered to be a suitable design for a chemical structure with
an ester bond between the APe-Im group and the PEG chain to sustain
the gene expression in vivo.

Conclusions
In
vivo sustainable gene expression 2 weeks after transfection
has been achieved by our original concept of the MIC between pDNA
and APe-Im-E-PEG. APe-Im-E-PEG is designed to cleave PEG from the
MIC gradually for 2 weeks, resulting in the hemolytic activity under
acidic pH conditions for the endosomal escape to enhance gene expression.
The achievement of in vivo sustainable gene expression for 2 weeks
by our pDNA MIC is promising for clinical application to produce therapeutic
proteins continuously using pDNA.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
α-Succinimidyloxysuccinyl-ω-methoxy,
polyoxyethylene (NHS-E-PEG) (average molecular weight of 2267) was
purchased from NOF corporation (Tokyo, Japan). 1-(3-Aminopropyl)imidazole
was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan).
6-Bromohexanamide was purchased from Combi-Blocks Inc. (San Diego,
CA). All other chemicals were of special grade and used without further
purification.

Synthesis of APe-Im-E-PEG
A typical
procedure is as
follows (Figure 1):
NHS-E-PEG (400 mg, 0.2 mmol) and 1-(3-aminopropyl)imidazole (118 μL,
1.0 mmol) were mixed in 3 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of 139 μL (1.0 mmol)
of triethylamine (TEA) and incubated at 50 °C for 24 h. The resulting
mixture was dialyzed against distilled water with the Spectra/Por
CE membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 100–500), followed
by freeze-drying.

The resulting sample (Im-E-PEG) (240 mg: 0.1
mmol) and 6-bromohexanamide (194 mg: 1 mmol) were mixed in 10 mL of
DMF in the presence of 14 μL (0.1 mmol) of TEA and incubated
at 50 °C for 24 h. To the resulting mixture, 6-bromohexanamide
(194 mg: 1 mmol) was repeatedly added. The resulting mixture was further
incubated at 50 °C for 24 h. Then, the resulting mixture was
dialyzed against distilled water with the Spectra/Por CE membrane
(molecular weight cutoff of 100–500). The resulting sample
(APe-Im-E-PEG) after the dialysis was collected by freeze-drying.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
The polymer (5 mg) was
dissolved in 600 μL of D2O (99.8 atom % deuterium;
Acros, NJ). The 1H NMR spectra (500 MHz) were recorded
by a Bruker AV500 spectrometer (Billerica, MA).

Gel Filtration
Chromatography (GFC)
GFC was carried
out using a JASCO PU-980 pumping system (Tokyo, Japan) at the flow
rate of 1.0 mL/min with a Shodex OHpak SB-804 HQ column (Showa Denko
K. K., Tokyo, Japan). The aqueous solution containing PBS(-) was used
as a mobile phase. One hundred microliters of 1 mg/mL samples, which
were incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks in (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) buffer at pH 7.4 or pH 5.0, were injected into the column. The
eluate was detected with a RI detector (RI-1530; Jasco) and a UV detector
(UV-2077; Jasco).

Agarose Gel Retardation Assay
A
stock solution of APe-Im-E-PEG
(0.5–7.9 μL) was added to the dilution (500 ng of pDNA)
of pDNA stock solution with H2O. Then, the final volume
was adjusted to 13.5 μL at various [ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA ratios. The resulting mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24
h, and mixed with a loading buffer (1.5 μL). Subsequently, the
resulting sample was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel containing 1 μg/mL
EtBr. Gel electrophoresis (50 V, 30 min) was carried out at room temperature
in TAE buffer (Tris-acetate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)).
pDNA was electrophoresed with size standard maker, and the pDNA bands
were visualized under UV irradiation. For the competitive inhibition
of the MIC formation, gel electrophoresis was run in the presence
of dextran sulfate (1–4 mM as sulfate group) incubated at 37
°C for 2 h after the MIC formation. For the competitive exchange
of MIC, furthermore, the electrophoresis was carried out in the presence
of 10% FBS incubated at 37 °C for 5 min after the MIC formation.

Particle Size Measurement
The size of pDNA (13.3 μg)
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with APe-Im-E-PEG at various [ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA ratios was measured in 100 μL of phosphate-buffered saline
without divalent cations, i.e., PBS(-), by a dynamic light scattering
method using an electrophoresis light scattering spectrophotometer
(ELS-Z2, Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the ζ-potential
was measured by ELS with electrodes.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM) Observations of the MIC
Structures
A TEM sample solution for observing the MIC was
prepared by mixing 10 μL of a twice-diluted MIC solution with
10 μL of 2% uranyl acetate on ice. A TEM grid (Nisshin EM Co.,
Tokyo, Japan), which had been hydrophilized by an Eiko IB-3 ion coater
(Eiko Engineering Co., Ltd., Shimane, Japan), was dipped into the
sample solution for 45 s. The excess solution was blotted away. The
grids were observed by a JEM-1400 Bio-TEM (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
operated at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.

Cell Viability Assay
HepG2 cells (from Riken Bioresource
Center Cell Bank), human hepatoma cell line as a representative cell,
were cultured in tissue culture flasks containing Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
FBS. The cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well in
a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were treated with APe-Im-E-PEG (0–10
mg/mL) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. By additional incubation
for 4 h, the cell viability was measured using the Alamar Blue assay44 in triplicate.

Hemolysis Assay
Eighty microliters of the stock solution
(10 mg/mL) of APe-Im-E-PEG was incubated for 1 or 2 weeks at 37 °C.
Then, partial 50 μL of the stock solution was added to 1.25
mL of the 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4 and pH 5.0) containing
130 mM NaCl. Then, 1.3 mL of each APe-Im-E-PEG solution was incubated
with 100 μL of rabbit erythrocytes (kindly given by Keio University,
Tokyo, Japan) for 1 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation (13 000
rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), the released hemoglobin (Hb) was determined
by measuring the absorbance at 577 nm of the 3-fold diluted supernatant.

In Vivo Gene Delivery into the Skeletal Muscles by APe-Im-E-PEG
In vivo gene delivery into the skeletal muscles of mice with APe-Im-E-PEG
was carried out using previously described methods.45 Briefly, ICR mice (5 weeks old, male) were anesthetized
with pentobarbital. The complexes between pDNA (5 μg) and APe-Im-E-PEG
at various [ω-amide-pentylimidazolium]APe-Im-E-PEG/[phosphate]pDNA ratios in 35 μL of PBS(-), which
were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, were injected into the tibialis
muscles of the ICR mice. One week or two weeks after the injection,
the whole tibialis muscles were collected and homogenized. The muscles
were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.1 M Tris–HCl (pH 7.8),
0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 mM EDTA). Luciferase activity was measured
using a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a luminometer
(LB96V, Belthold Japan Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The activity is determined
by relative light units (RLU) per milligram of protein. The pcDNA3-Luc
plasmid, derived from pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), was used
as a pDNA encoding the firefly luciferase gene under the control of
a cytomegalovirus promoter.
