The
work being presented in this paper demonstrates the simple
and efficient “transition-metal-free” and “light-mediated”
synthetic protocol for the synthesis of aryl iodides/biaryls/alkynes
from aryl bromides. Under ultraviolet irradiation and in basic aqueous
media, aryl bromides undergo transformation into aryl iodides which
efficiently couple via a cascade reaction with a wide range of terminal
alkynes/unactivated arenes to generate target molecules under green
conditions.

1 Introduction
Biaryl
compounds are essential precursor materials for the preparation
of compounds having diverse industrial and pharmaceutical applications.1a,1b Till date, transition-metal-catalyzed direct arylation of C–H
bond is the best approach for the synthesis of biaryl derivatives.2a−2d Although this approach is highly efficient, utilization of catalytic
systems based on costly and toxic metal ions raises serious economic
and environmental issues. Further, separation of the target molecule
from the metal-based catalytic system is time-consuming and a costly
process. Thus, efforts are in progress to develop an economic and
ecofriendly “transition-metal-free” strategy for the
preparation of biaryl targets via cross-coupling of unactivated arenes
and aryl halides. Recently, various “transition-metal-free”
protocols have been reported which involve utilization of a variety
of ligands such as phenanthroline, 1,2-dimethylethylenediamine, or
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds as additives3a,3b in combination with metal-tert-butoxide as a base
to promote cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and unactivated
arenes. Unfortunately, the recyclability of the catalyst in this strategy
remains a big task and the high loading of nitrogen-containing compounds
decreased the economic and environmental advantages of the strategy.
This strategy is still growing, and efforts are in progress to employ
visible light to carry out cross-coupling reaction under eco-friendly
and economic conditions. Recently, visible-light-mediated synthesis
of biaryl targets by using a photosensitive complex of potassium-tert-butoxide (KOtBu) and nitrogenous
heterocyclic ligands as a photocatalyst has been reported.4 Further, powerful light sources (two HPI-T 400
W lamps) have been utilized for direct arylation of benzene using
dimethyl sulfoxide-solvated KOtBu.5 Although this base and light-assisted approach
for the synthesis of biaryls is economic and environmental friendly,
the requirement of excess amount of ligand (50 mol %) necessitates
additional efforts for the development of “green” protocol
for the synthesis of biaryls. Another problem associated with the
“transition-metal-free” synthesis of biaryl derivatives
using this approach is regarding one of its starting material, that
is, aromatic iodides.6 Most of the reactions
involving the preparation of biaryls work best when aromatic iodides
are used as one of the coupling partner. Previously, copper- or nickel-catalyzed
strategies for the preparation of aryl iodide have been reported;
however, these methods suffer from a series of limitations which include
limited substrate scope and the requirement for high temperatures
(>100 °C).7a−7d All of these limitations make the product isolation difficult which
increases the overall cost of the synthetic process. Thus, aromatic
iodides are needed in abundance, and there is a need for the development
of a simple and facile approach for the synthesis of aryl iodides.
Recently, the synthesis of complex organic molecules by cascade reaction
has emerged as an economic and eco-friendly approach. Cascade reactions
initiated by the radical addition are synthetically very attractive
because they allow access to molecular skeletons in only one synthetic
step under very mild conditions, enabling them to exhibit high functional
group compatibility. Additionally, cascade protocol reduces the time
of reaction, efforts involved in the reaction setup, and the waste
generated by the several chemical processes.

Our research work
involves the development of new catalytic systems
for harvesting solar radiations for carrying out a variety of reactions.8a−8c Considering the importance of cascade reaction and the role of UV
light in the activation of starting materials, we began by exploring
the optimized conditions for biaryl synthesis under “transition-metal-free”
conditions starting from aryl iodides. Gratifyingly, we were successful
in improving the existing protocol of the UV light-mediated “transition-metal-free”
strategy for the synthesis of aryl iodides from aryl bromides. Furthermore,
we were successful in developing the “metal-free” and
light-mediated cascade synthetic protocol for the synthesis of alkynes
from aryl iodides and terminal alkynes via Sonogashira coupling reaction.
As per our knowledge, this is the first report where aromatic Finkelstein
reaction/biaryl coupling and aromatic Finkelstein reaction/Sonogashira
coupling have been demonstrated in (i) one-pot two-step reaction and
(ii) cascade reaction under “transition-metal-free”
conditions for the synthesis of biaryls/alkynes, respectively. In
this protocol, the product isolation is simple and all of the target
molecules were purified by recrystallization from organic solvents,
and no column chromatography was needed for the purification of final
products.

2 Results and Discussion
The traditional
methods for the synthesis of aryl iodides involve
treatment of aryl bromides with inorganic halides such as NaI in the
presence of high loading of catalytic systems (Figure 1a).9a−9c

Figure 1 (a) Previous methods of preparing aryl
iodides from aryl bromides.
(b) Our photochemical method for synthesizing aryl iodides using UV
light.

Our strategy about UV light-mediated
aromatic Finkelstein reaction
is based on already reported photoinduced single-electron transfer
(SET) from NaI to aryl bromides in acetonitrile (ACN) using UV light
under argon.10a,10b We envisioned that this electron
transfer can also occur under argon-free conditions. Hence, we began
our study by carrying out the conversion of aryl bromides to aryl
iodides under aerial conditions using potassium iodide (KI) and I2 in ACN. We chose conversion of bromobenzene (1a) to iodobenzene (2a) in ACN as a model reaction under
argon (Figure 1b).
The photoheating effect of the UV lamp was prevented by submerging
the reaction vial in a water bath.

The reaction moved very smoothly
in the presence of KI and iodine,
and the target product was isolated in 80% yield after completion
of the reaction (36 h) (entry 1, Table S1). We then carried the above reaction under argon-free conditions
(aerial conditions), and to our surprise, the desired product was
isolated in 73% yield in 40 h (entry 2, Table S1). Under aerial atmosphere, the target compound was obtained
in slightly lower yield because of the electron capturing ability
of oxygen.4 The conversion of bromobenzene
(1a) to iodobenzene (2a) in the presence
of KI and I2 was then also examined in other solvents such
as H2O/ACN (1:1) and H2O (entries 3 and 4, Table S1) under aerial conditions. In all cases,
except H2O, yields remained almost same. Therefore, we
chose a H2O/ACN (1:1) solvent system for our further studies.
The model reaction under visible light irradiation10a and under dark conditions did not proceed (entries 5 and
6, Table S1).

Having identified the
optimal conditions for the room-temperature
metal-free strategy under the aerial conditions, we next sought to
define the scope of the reaction for the preparation of different
aryl iodides (Figure 1b and Table S2). The present photocatalytic
aromatic Finkelstein reaction displayed a high functional group tolerance
(entries 2–7, Table S2) and proved
to be a general method for the preparation of aryl iodides in good
yields (up to 70%) under very mild conditions. Electron-releasing
as well as electron-withdrawing groups gave the target compounds in
good yields. Furthermore, the target molecules were purified by recrystallization9b from organic solvents, and no column chromatography
was needed for the purification of final products except compound 2a (for detailed procedure, see Supporting Information). We monitored the reaction between 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene
and KI using I2 in H2O/ACN (1:1) using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The sample from the reaction mixture was
withdrawn after 14 h, and after usual workup (no purification), 1H NMR spectrum was recorded. Then, the samples were withdrawn
after 24 and 38 h, and the same procedure was repeated to record the 1H NMR spectra. Finally, the reaction was stopped after 52
h. The resulting suspension was quenched with aqueous solution of
Na2S2O3. The solution was then extracted
with the organic solvent (EtOAc). The EtOAc layer was dried over Na2SO4. The organic layer was then concentrated in
vacuo and then purified by recrystallization from methanol.9b The stacked spectra of all of the samples show
the gradual consumption of 4-bromonitrobenzene and subsequential formation
of 4-iodonitrobenzene (Figure S9A,B, Supporting Information). This broad substrate scope of the strategy could
be helpful in facilitating the further functionalization of the prepared
aryl iodides. Moreover, this procedure for the model reaction, when
adapted to the gram-scale reaction, resulted in the formation of the
product in 63% yield.

To confirm the pathway for the reaction,
we performed the model
reaction in the presence of (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl
(TEMPO) (a typical radical scavenger) and benzoquinone (another radical
scavenger) in the H2O/ACN (1:1) solvent system. Even after
40 h, the conversions did not take place (entries 7 and 8, Table S1). The above control experiments indicate
a radical pathway for the aromatic Finkelstein reaction. The mechanism
of the photocatalytic aromatic Finkelstein reaction is based on the
photoinduced SET from KI to aryl bromides.10a In this mechanism, the transfer of one electron from KI to aryl
bromide takes place upon irradiation with UV light, resulting in the
formation of aromatic radical anion species, which undergoes further
fragmentation to form an aryl radical and bromide anion. We tested
the generation of Br– anion during the reaction
by a AgNO3 test. Upon the addition of AgNO3 solution
to the reaction mixture, the solid precipitated out. We recorded the
powder X-ray diffraction spectra of this solid which clearly indicates
the formation of AgBr (Figure S8, Supporting Information).11 Majority of these aryl radicals are
trapped by an iodine radical, producing the desired product (Scheme
S1, Supporting Information).

After
developing a “green” protocol for the preparation
of aryl halides via aromatic Finkelstein reaction, we aimed at utilizing
these aryl halides as starting materials for direct arylation of unactivated
arenes for the construction of biaryls via C–H activation.
Very recently, 1,10-phenanthroline-mediated synthesis of biaryls has
been reported in the presence of visible light under inert conditions,
but the use of an excessive amount of 1,10-phenanthroline (50 mol
%) is still necessary (Figure 2a).4 Inspired by these results,
we envisaged that it might be possible to drive the SET process in
biaryl coupling using UV light only. We were particularly interested
in carrying out aromatic C–H activation in an atom-economic
and waste-free manner.

Figure 2 (a) Previous methods of preparing biaryls from aryl iodides.
(b)
Our photochemical method for synthesizing biaryls using direct/one-pot
two-step/cascade strategy in the presence of UV light.

We carried out the model reaction between 4-iodoanisole
(3d) and benzene (4a) under inert conditions
in
the presence of UV light under metal-free conditions using KOtBu as a base (Figure 2bi). The desired product (5d) was obtained in good yield (66%) at 30 °C. We found that the
use of UV light in the presence of KOtBu enabled the desired C–H arylated product (5d) in 66% yield (entry 1, Table S3) (see Supporting Information).

The necessity of the key reaction components
(light source and
base) was demonstrated through a series of control experiments (entries
1–10, Table S3) (see Supporting Information). The reactions in the dark and under visible light gave the desired
product (5d) in a negligible yield (entries 2 and 3,
Table S3) (see Supporting Information).
Although the amount (61%) of the product remained almost same under
the aerial conditions (entry 4, Table S3) (see Supporting Information), no reaction was observed upon exclusion
of UV light (entry 5, Table S3) (see Supporting Information). It is clear from the control experiments (entries
1–5, Table S3) (see Supporting Information) that ultraviolet irradiation is essential for this reaction, as
no biaryl product was observed without UV light.

The cleavage
of the Ar–X bond under UV light irradiation,
generally, generates the aryl radical in the absence of a metal catalyst.
The aryl radical is then trapped by the nucleophile to produce the
desired product. The presence of a base such as KOtBu is necessary to trigger the reaction by photoinduced electron
transfer to ArX.12

We also examined
other bases (entries 6–8, Table S3) (see Supporting Information) and replaced KOtBu with K3PO4, NaOH, and KOAc
individually; however, an excellent yield was obtained only when KOtBu was used as a base, and almost no product
was detected with other bases used. To explore the potential applications
of this method, a variety of substituted aromatic iodides (ArI) were
examined (Scheme 1).
It was observed that electron-donating substituents on the phenyl
ring, such as methoxy and methyl groups, promoted the cross-coupling
reaction with high efficiency, whereas in the presence of electron-deficient
aryl iodides (−NO2, −Br), target compounds
were furnished in moderate yields. Various functional groups were
found to be compatible, thus suggesting the great potential of this
strategy for further transformation of the cross-coupling products.
Other arenes with different substituted groups were also tested to
demonstrate the wide applicability of this reaction (entries 5i–k and 5n–q, Scheme 1). Under the optimized conditions,
arenes such as toluene (4b), anisole (4c), nitrobenzene (4d), fluorobenzene (4e), chlorobenzene (4f), and bromobenzene (4g) could couple with 4-iodotoluene (3b) to give the products
(5i–k, n–q) in moderate yield.
Additionally, anisole (4c) could also couple with 4-iodoanisole
(3d) to give the product (5k) in moderate
yield. We also carried out the reaction of 2-bromoiodobenzene (3k) with benzene to give the target product (5r) in moderate yield. Furthermore, the target molecules were purified
by recrystallization from organic solvents, and no column chromatography
was needed for the purification of final products. Under these optimized
conditions, aryl bromides could not furnish the desired products.

Scheme 1 UV Light-Induced Synthesis of Biaryl Derivatives (5a–r) under Aerial Conditions at 30 °C
Isolated
yields determined after
recrystallization.

To gain insight into the
mechanism of this transition-metal-free
biaryl coupling reaction, the model reaction was carried out in the
presence of TEMPO; however, the reaction did not proceed (entry 9,
Table S3) (see Supporting Information).
However, we were successful in isolating the para-adduct between 4-iodotoluene
and TEMPO whose structure was confirmed from 1H NMR spectra
(Figure S28, Supporting Information). Similarly,
addition of benzoquinone afforded the desired product in negligible
yield (entry 10, Table S3) (see Supporting Information). All of these studies clearly suggest that the generated radical
species were essential for carrying out UV light-induced biaryl coupling.

To understand the regioselectivity of the reaction, we carried
out the reaction between 4-iodotoluene (3b) and benzene
to yield (5b) which was then purified by recrystallization
from methanol. The residual liquid left after the separation of solid
from the reaction mixture was subjected to 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The 1H NMR spectra of the residual liquid did not suggest
the formation of any other compound (Figure S29, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the reaction between
2-bromoiodobenzene (3k) and benzene under the optimized
conditions resulted in the formation of ortho-(5r) isomer (Figure S30, Supporting Information). The reaction between 4-iodotoluene and TEMPO resulted in the formation
of parasubstituted adduct (Figure S28, Supporting Information). All of these results support the regioselectivity
of biaryl coupling.

On the basis of these results, we propose
a plausible reaction
mechanism, as shown in Scheme S2 (see Supporting Information).13 In the presence
of base (KOtBu), aryl halide (3) generates an aryl halide radical [A] via SET process.
Addition of benzene afforded radical [B]. With the assistance
of KOtBu, deprotonation takes place resulting
in the formation of another radical anion [C]. This radical
anion then transfers an electron to another molecule of aryl halide
(3) (shown in blue), thereby propagating a chain reaction,
resulting in the formation of the final direct C–H arylation
product (5).

After carrying out C–X/C–C
bond formation reactions
(aromatic Finkelstein reaction and biaryl coupling) successfully in
the presence of UV light, we planned to carry out one-pot two-step
reaction comprising aromatic Finkelstein reaction and biaryl coupling
in sequence, for the synthesis of biaryls (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 One-Pot Two-Step Reaction Comprising
Aromatic Finkelstein Reaction
and Biaryl Coupling Reaction in Sequence To Synthesize Biaryl Derivatives
(5a–d, h) under Aerial Conditions
in the Presence of UV Light
First of all, we carried out the aromatic Finkelstein
reaction
of aryl bromides (1 mmol) (1a–c, e–f) and KI (3 mmol) using iodine (0.2 M in ACN) in ACN/H2O (1:1) at room temperature under aerial conditions in the presence
of UV light. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 40 h in the presence of UV light. The reaction was monitored using
TLC (Thin-Layer Chromatography).

After the completion of the
reaction (after 40 h, TLC of the reaction
mixture matches very well with the standard sample), benzene (4 mL)
and KOtBu (3 mmol) was charged into the
same reaction mixture in the same pot. The formation of the product
was monitored by TLC. When the reactants were consumed (after 72 h),
the resulting mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic
layer was concentrated in vacuo and purified by recrystallization
from methanol. The final products (5a–d, h) were obtained in two steps. The structure of the final
products (5a–d, h) was confirmed
from 1H NMR studies. To confirm the synthetic route, we
isolated one of the intermediates (2e) after partial
workup of the reaction mixture (Figure S31, Supporting Information).

After carrying out aromatic Finkelstein
reaction and biaryl coupling
successfully in one-pot two-step reaction in the presence of UV light
under aerial conditions, we planned to carry the reaction in single
step using a cascade reaction strategy. For this, the reaction vial
was charged with aryl bromide (1 mmol) (1a–c, e, g), ACN/H2O (1:1), KI (3 mmol),
I2 (0.2 M in ACN), arene (benzene/toluene/anisole/nitrobenzene)
(4 mL), and KOtBu (3 mmol) (all in sequence)
under aerial conditions in the presence of UV light (Scheme 3). The reaction mixture was
then stirred at rt for 40 h in the presence of UV light. The reaction
was monitored using TLC (after 40 h, TLC of the reaction mixture matches
very well with the standard sample), indicating the formation of aryl
iodide (Figure S10a, Supporting Information). The reaction was then continued under UV light irradiation at
30 °C. The formation of the final product was monitored by TLC
again (Figure S10b, Supporting Information). When the reactants were consumed (after 72 h), the resulting mixture
was diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was concentrated
in vacuo and purified by recrystallization from methanol. The structure
of the final products (5a–d, h–j, n) was confirmed from 1H NMR studies.

Scheme 3 Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Biaryl Derivatives (5a–d, h, i–j, n) under
Aerial Conditions in the Presence of UV Light
Encouraged by these results, we planned to scrutinize
the applicability
of the UV light for carrying out Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling
reaction under aerial conditions. The traditional methods for the
synthesis of alkynes involve treatment of aryl halides with terminal
alkynes in the presence of base using high loading of catalytic systems
at high temperatures14a−14c or using transition metals in the presence
of visible light (Figure 3a).15a,15b Very recently, this coupling
has been reported under transition metal free conditions in water
using UV light.16 However, there is no
report on the transition-metal-free cascade/one-pot two-step synthesis
of alkynes using Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling. In view of
these results, we envisioned that it might be possible to drive the
Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction using cascade strategy
by UV light only.

Figure 3 (a) Previous methods of preparing alkynes from aryl halides.
(b)
Our photochemical method for synthesizing alkynes using one-pot two-step
and cascade strategy in the presence of UV light.

We planned to carry out one-pot two-step reaction comprising
aromatic
Finkelstein reaction and Sonogashira coupling reaction in sequence
for the synthesis of alkynes (Scheme 4). First of all, we carried out the aromatic Finkelstein
reaction between aryl bromides (1 mmol) (1) and KI (3
mmol) using iodine (0.2 M in ACN) in ACN/H2O (1:1) at room
temperature under UV light. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 40 h at room temperature in the presence of UV light
under aerial conditions. The reaction was monitored using TLC. After
the completion of the reaction (the spot of the reaction mixture turned
brown in the iodine chamber after 40 h), phenylacetylene (6) (3 mmol) and KOtBu (3 mmol) were charged
into the same reaction mixture in the same pot. The reaction was then
continued at 30 °C under UV light irradiation. The formation
of the product was monitored by TLC. When the reactants were consumed
(after 75 h), the resulting mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate.
The organic layer was concentrated in vacuo and purified by recrystallization
from methanol. The structure of the final products (9a–e) was confirmed from 1H spectroscopy. To confirm the synthetic
route, we isolated the intermediate (2a) after partial
workup of the reaction mixture (Figure S32, Supporting Information).

Scheme 4 One-Pot Two-Step Reaction Comprising Aromatic
Finkelstein Reaction
and Sonogashira–Hagihara Coupling in Sequence To Synthesize
Alkynes (9a–e) under Aerial Conditions in the
Presence of UV Light
After carrying out aromatic Finkelstein reaction and Sonogashira
coupling successfully in the one-pot two-step reaction in the presence
of UV light under aerial conditions, we planned to carry out the reaction
in single step using cascade strategy. For this, we carried out the
model reaction using 4-bromobenzene (0.05 g, 1 mmol) in ACN/H2O (1:1), KI (3 mmol), I2 (0.2 M in ACN), phenylacetylene
(3 mmol) (6), and KOtBu (3
mmol) (all in sequence) under aerial conditions in the presence of
UV light (Figure S33, Supporting Information). The reaction mixture was then stirred at rt. for 40 h in the presence
of UV light. The reaction was monitored using TLC. After 40 h, the
spot of the reaction mixture turned brown in the iodine chamber, indicating
the formation of iodobenzene (TLC of the reaction mixture matches
very well with the standard sample) (Figure S33a, Supporting Information). The reaction was then continued at
30 °C under UV light irradiation. The formation of the final
product (9a) was monitored by TLC again (Figure S33b, Supporting Information). When the reactants were
consumed (after 65 h), the resulting mixture was diluted with ethyl
acetate. The organic layer was concentrated in vacuo and purified
by recrystallization from methanol. The structure of the final product
(9a) was confirmed from 1H NMR studies.

With the optimized reaction conditions, the generality of the method
was investigated and the products are summarized in Scheme 5. The scope of the reaction
was explored with respect to the various substituted aryl bromides.
As shown in Scheme 5, various functional groups on the aromatic rings displayed good
tolerance under the optimized conditions. Aromatic halides with electron-donating
or electron-withdrawing groups can react smoothly with phenylacetylene
to give the corresponding alkynes in moderate to good yields (entries 9a–9h, Scheme 5). In addition, bromobenzene could also couple with 4-ethynylpyridine
to give derivative (9g) in 56% yield. Also, the reaction
between 3-bromopyridine (8) and phenylacetylene resulted
in the formation of derivative (9h) in 55% yield.

Scheme 5 Cascade Reaction for the Synthesis of Alkynes (9a–h) under Aerial Conditions in the Presence of UV Light
Isolated yields determined after
recrystallization.

To understand the regioselectivity
of the reaction, we carried
out the reaction between bromobenzene and phenylacetylene to yield
(9a) which was then purified by recrystallization from
methanol. The residual liquid left after the separation of solid from
the reaction mixture was subjected to 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The 1H NMR spectra of the residual liquid did not suggest
the formation of any other compounds (Figure S42, Supporting Information). Furthermore, the reaction between
3-bromopyridine (8) and phenylacetylene under the standard
conditions resulted in the formation of metaisomer only (9h) (Figure S41, Supporting Information).
All of the above experiments show the regioselectivity of sp2–sp couplings.

We believe that initially aryl bromide
gets converted to aryl iodide
by aromatic Finkelstein reaction in the presence of UV light. The
aryl C–I bond then undergoes homolytical cleavage to generate
a pair of aryl and iodine radicals. The aryl radical then reacts with
phenylacetylene to generate a vinyl radical, which abstracts an iodine
atom rapidly either from the aryl iodide or the free iodine atom in
the solution. Finally, a base abstracts the proton from vinyl iodide
to give the desired coupling product (Scheme S3, Supporting Information).16

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have examined a UV light-induced,
transition-metal-free
cascade protocol to couple unactivated arenes with all types of activated/unactivated
aryl bromides. As per our information, this is the first report for
the cascade synthesis of alkynes via aromatic Finkelstein reaction
and Sonogashira–Hagihara coupling reaction. This work not only
provides a simple and greener protocol for the synthesis of biaryl/alkyne
compounds but also contributes toward making the aryl iodide chemistry
more green.
