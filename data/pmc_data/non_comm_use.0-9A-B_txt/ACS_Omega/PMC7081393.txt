Graphene oxide-silver nanocomposite
(GO-Ag) was fabricated via
the sonochemical method, which shows unique physiochemical properties.
Graphene oxide (GO) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized
by modified Hummer’s and Chemical reduction methods, respectively.
The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized using powder X-ray
diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.
The surface morphology of synthesized nanoparticles was studied using
scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.
The thermoluminescence property of the nanocomposite was analyzed
by irradiating the samples in gamma radiation at 1 kGy. Electrochemical
reversibility of the GO-Ag nanocomposite was examined by cyclic voltammetry.
The photocatalytic application of the nanocomposite was studied using
degradation of methylene blue dye. Results reveal that doping of AgNPs
on the GO surface not only improves its dye degradation property but
also enhances its thermoluminescence property. This knowledge will
be helpful in determining the antibacterial property of the GO-Ag
nanocomposite in the future.

1 Introduction
Over the last few decades
with the advent of nanotechnology, scientists
have drawn extreme research interest regarding nanomaterial development.
Among the nanomaterials, graphene and related compounds have emerged
as a distinctive class of materials because of their unique structure
and functionalities. Graphene oxide (GO), a monolayer sheet of graphite,
serves as a precursor for the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide
(rGO).1 Like graphene, GO has a similar
hexagonal carbon structure with hydroxyl (−OH), alkoxy (C–O–C),
carbonyl (C–O), carboxylic acid (−COOH), and other oxygen-based
functional groups as shown in Figure 1.2,3 Due to the presence of these functional
groups, GO exhibits hydrophilic character that makes it a water-soluble
nanomaterial.4 Moreover, the surface functionalization
of GO has presented many opportunities regarding its application in
the development of nanocomposite materials. GO has high conductivity
and shows diverse applications in the field such as sensors, anticancer
properties, electronics, biomedicine antibacterial coatings, photocatalytic
activity, water decontamination, solar desalination, and drug delivery.5−21 However, the nanocomposite enhances GO properties. Among all transition
elements, silver (Ag) is the most conductive and reactive material
and has also been used recently in fabricating silver-doped graphene
oxide with favorable properties of low resistance, good dispersion,
and enhanced mechanical strength.22 Recently,
due to its bactericidal nature, AgNPs are getting much attention in
antibacterial applications.23 AgNPs are
dispersed on the surface of GO and intercalated in between the layers
of GO to study the electrochemical properties and photocatalytic dye
degradation rate of the samples.

Here in the present work, the
GO-Ag nanocomposite was synthesized
by the sonochemical method coupled with subsequent shock freezing.
The effect of doping on various properties such as size, morphology,
and composition of GO nanocomposite was also analyzed. The electrochemical
reversibility and capability of GO-Ag nanocomposite working as a photocatalyst
for removal of dye from wastewater were also examined. Results concluded
that this will add additional knowledge to develop GO-Ag nanocomposites
for various applications.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
SEM micrographs
of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite are shown in Figure 2. Different layers
of GO are observed in Figure 2a, whereas the deposition of AgNPs on the GO surface is observed
in Figure 2b.24

Figure 2 SEM micrographs of (a) GO and (b) GO-Ag nanocomposite
and (c) EDX
of GO-Ag nanocomposite.

The elemental analysis
of the GO-Ag nanocomposite was performed
by using EDX, which confirmed that 36.17% of AgNPs were deposited
on the GO surface. A peak near 1.0 keV was observed, which corresponds
to carbon, and a peak around 3 keV was correlated to the binding energy
of AgL.25 Results
indicate that a synthesized GO-Ag nanocomposite was composed of GO/AgNPs
in the 2:1 ratio and no other impurities were detected in the EDX
spectrum. This kind of AgNP-functionalized GO nanocomposite could
be a promising material in the field of water purification.

2.2 Transmittance Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The morphology
of the GO-Ag nanocomposite was examined by using
TEM (Figure 3). It
represents the exfoliated GO sheet, whereas GO exhibits the lamellar
structure where AgNPs were embedded (Figure 3b).24 The average
size of AgNPs was about 18 nm (calculated using ImageJ software).
This result was in good agreement with XRD, which suggests the FCC
pattern of AgNPs and also proposed that AgNPs are intercalated on
the GO surface.

Figure 3 TEM micrographs of (a) GO and (b) GO-Ag nanocomposite.

2.3 Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD) Analysis
Figure 4 represents
the PXRD pattern of synthesized GO, AgNPs, and GO-Ag nanocomposites.
The PXRD pattern of GO exhibits a strong 2θ = 10.19° value
that corresponds to the plane (001). Additionally, a small peak at
2θ = 20.93° was observed, which reflects the
(002) plane. In GO, the interlayer spacing increased as compared to
graphite due to addition of oxygen-containing functional groups during
oxidation of graphite.26 AgNPs exhibited
a major diffraction peak with the 2θ value of 38.152° representing
the (111) plane and are in good agreement with the previously reported
literature.27 The GO-Ag nanocomposite (with
interlayer spacing of 1.456 nm) exhibited a peak related to both GO
and Ag nanoparticle. But a slight shift in the peak position toward
lower 2θ value confirm the intercalation of AgNPs within GO
sheets, as shown in Figure 4c.28

Figure 4 PXRD patterns for (a)
GO, (b) AgNPs, and (c) GO-Ag nanocomposites.

2.4 Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectra
of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite are shown in Figure 5. As seen from the figure, GO exhibited D
and G bands at 1347 and 1583 cm–1, respectively,
whereas the D and G bands of the GO-Ag nanocomposite appeared at 1353
and 1592 cm–1, respectively. The D band was assigned
to the breathing mode of k-point phonons with A1g symmetry,
and the G band was ascribed to E2g phonon of sp2 carbon atoms.29 After doping, the D and
G band values increase due to intercalation of AgNPs on the GO surface.
The result is in good agreement with the corresponding PXRD data.

spectra of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite.

2.5 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Analysis
The FTIR spectra of synthesized GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite
ranging between 4000 and 400 cm–1 are presented
in Figure 6. In GO,
an adsorption band appeared at 3675 cm–1, corresponding
to intermolecular H-bonding, which disappeared in the GO-Ag nanocomposite.
Additionally, other bands appeared at 2979, 1392, and 1046 cm–1, corresponding to C–H, C=O, and C–O,
respectively. After doping, a decrease in intensity of C=O
and −OH band reflected intercalation of AgNPs on the GO surface.
A blue shift was observed for these peaks after doping.30,31

Figure 6 FTIR
spectra of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite.

2.6 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
The electrochemical
properties of the synthesized nanocomposite were studied using cyclic
voltammetry, as shown in Figure 7. CV graphs of GO show a cathodic peak potential at
0.04 V and an anodic peak potential at −0.6 V because of the
presence of favorable oxygenated species on the GO surface, which
create edge plane defects during the electrochemical reaction. It
has been noted that oxygenated species can alter the observed electrochemistry
of this redox probe.32 The CV plot of rthe
GO-Ag composite shows a pair of redox peaks at −0.64 and −0.80
V for cathodic and anodic sweeps, respectively, representing Ag0/1+ interconversion.

Figure 7 Cyclic voltammetry of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposites.

2.7 Thermoluminescence (TL)
Thermoluminescence
(TL) is a well-known process that occurs due to thermally assisted
release of irradiation-induced electrons from traps of the material.
The TL curve provides important information such as kinetic parameters
(activation energy, frequency factor, and order of kinetics) of materials,
which have been subjected to radiations earlier. Thermoluminescence
(TL) for GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite were recorded using a Harshaw
TL reader 3500 after irradiation by a gamma irradiation source (Co60).33Figure 8a represents the glow curve of GO and GO-Ag
nanocomposite at a gamma irradiation dose of 1 kGy. GO shows a prominent
TL peak at 422 K due to the relaxation of defects such as lattice
defects or disorders, which were trapped by charge carriers during
gamma irradiation.34 However, in the case
of GO-Ag nanocomposites, the TL intensity increases with a peak position
at 410 K along with a shoulder at 510 K. An increase in TL intensity
after doping AgNPs concludes that Ag creates more traps between the
valence band and the conduction band along with the increase in initial
concentration of charge carriers. The two apparent TL peaks of the
GO-Ag nanocomposite in the glow curve signify that there are possibly
two kinds of trapping sites (defects) present. However, it can be
seen that these TL glow curves are asymmetric and complex curves;
therefore, after careful analysis of the TL glow curve using the deconvolution
method based on Kitti’s general-order equations, it is found
that there are four kinds of traps exist in both samples, as shown
in Figure 8b. The order
of kinetics, activation energy, and frequency factor was calculated
using Kitti’s general-order equation, as listed in Table 1. It can be observed
from the activation energies of all four traps that Ag doping in GO
shifts trap distribution.

Figure 8 Glow curve (a) and trap curve (b) recorded for
different samples
at a constant exposed to a dose of 1 kGy.

2.8 Photocatalytic Dye Degradation
To
demonstrate the practical utility of our compound as a photocatalyst
for the degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution under
UV visible radiation, MB dye solution was chosen as a sample. The
potential ability of our compound was evaluated using MB dye solution
by measuring the successive decrease in the absorption intensity as
a function of exposure time. The photolysis of dye solution does not
show a considerable change in their absorbance spectra. The comparative
absorption spectra were plotted by using the absorption maxima of
individual photocatalytic activity shown in Figure 9a. The graph shows no appreciable change
in absorbance after the addition of the catalyst under dark for nearly
30 min, which confirms its reactivity in light.

Figure 9 Dye degradation: (a)
percent degradation versus t, (b) C/Co versus t, and (c)
ln(Co/C) versus t plots for GO, AgNPs, and GO-Ag nanocomposite.

The decrease in the absorbance values of the chosen dye molecules
(MB) after the exposure of suspension in UV–visible radiation
was observed. The C/Co plot with respect to time shows
that for GO-Ag nanocomposite MB dye molecules were degraded up to
88% while GO degradation is up to 64% (Figure 9b). To measure the photocatalytic ability
of the catalyst, its kinetic studies were also performed. The kinetic
plot of ln(Co/C) versus
the exposure time shows the linear behavior, which confirms that it
follows pseudo-first-order kinetics.

The GO-Ag nanocomposite
exhibits enhanced catalytic activity. This
may originate from the synergy of a number of processes occurring
simultaneously during the photocatalytic reaction. The degradation
mechanism can be assigned to the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) produced continuously during the photocatalytic process under
the UV light irradiation, as shown in Figure10. The AgNPs on the surface of GO sheets
enhance the absorption coefficient of UV light due to the strong surface
plasmon resonance (SPR). GO being a good electron acceptor and excellent
charge transporter provides trapping sites for the electrons and delays
the recombination process of electron (e–) and hole
(h+) pair. The e– and holes interact
with the dissolved O2 and water in the presence of light
to produce reactive oxygen species (O2, OH, etc.; eqs 1–3). These reactive species attack the dye molecules, resulting
in degradation to CO2 and H2O (eq 4). 1   2   3   4

GO-Ag nanocomposite under UV light irradiation.

As shown by the results, the photocatalytic degradation of methylene
blue had increased many folds when it was treated with the GO-Ag nanocomposite.24 The above analysis confirms that the GO-Ag nanocomposite
could be used as a promising material for the treatment of wastewater
in the future.

3 Conclusions
In this
study, we have synthesized GO, AgNPs, and GO-Ag nanocomposite
and studied their thermoluminescence as well as photocatalytic properties.
The GO-Ag nanocomposite was prepared by the sonochemical method. SEM
and TEM micrographs have clearly shown the deposition of AgNPs on
the surface of GO. Electrochemical activity of the GO-Ag nanocomposite
and GO was studied using CV. The results have clearly shown inherent
redox activity and chemical reversibility of the GO-Ag nanocomposite,
so it could be used as a promising material for biosensors or other
electrochemical applications. Thermoluminescence of the GO-Ag nanocomposite
depicts the peak shift toward lower temperature, which suggested the
possible use of the nanocomposite in medical dosimetry purposes as
well as in radiation dosimetry after certain optimizations. Comparative
studies of GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite will provide insight into the
doping of metal nanoparticles in the graphene moiety to enhance its
practicability in many fields.

4 Material and Methods
All chemicals were purchased from Merck, India. Concentrated H2SO4 (97%, v/v) was purchased from Fisher Scientific.

4.1 Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO)
Graphene oxide was
synthesized using the modified Hummers method
in which graphite was oxidized on treatment with KMnO4 and
NaNO3 in concentrated H2SO4.35 Graphite powder (1.2 g), to increase the interlayer
spacing of the carbon source, and sodium nitrate (2 g; all chemicals
purchased from Merck, India) were taken in a beaker containing 50
mL of concentrated H2SO4 (97%, v/v; Fisher Scientific).36 At the outset, we implemented a precooling protocol
(PCP) to control the highly exothermic nature of the involved reactions,
which appeared as the primary reason for its explosive nature.1 The reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h in ice-cold
water, maintaining its temperature (0–6 °C), and then
6 g of KMnO4 was slowly added to the reaction mixture.
This mixture was controlled carefully to maintain the reaction temperature
lower than 14 °C as per PCP to eliminate any possibility of explosion.
After 2 h of continuous stirring, the ice bath was removed, and the
sample mixture was stirred at 30 °C until it turns into a brownish
paste and continued stirring for another 2 h for every half an hour
increase in temperature.37The reaction
was weakened with the addition of 100 mL of water, and the temperature
was increased quickly with effervescence with the change in color
from purple to brownish. The solution mixture was finally treated
with 8 mL of H2O2 to terminate the reaction.
Upon addition of H2O2, a sudden change in color
from dark brown to golden yellow was observed, which is a visual marker
for the formation of GO.38 Finally, the
mixture was centrifuged and rinsed with 8% HCl followed by DI water
for multiple times. The obtained precipitates were filtered, dried,
and ground in fine powder form.

4.2 Synthesis
of Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs)
Solution A of silver nitrate
was prepared by adding 3.4 g of AgNO3 in 20 mL of distilled
water. Solution B of polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) was prepared by dissolving PVP (1 g), glucose (1 g), and NaOH
(1 g) in 60 mL of distilled water together.39 Solution B was heated to 60 °C with continuous stirring, and
solution A was dropwise added to it. After that, the obtained mixture
was stirred for 10 min. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged, washed
with distilled water, and dried to get AgNPs.

4.3 Synthesis
of GO-Ag Nanocomposite
The coupled nanosystem of GO-Ag was
synthesized by mixing GO and
Ag in a 2:1 ratio in 50 mL of methanol. The mixture was sonicated
for 2 days followed by thermal annealing at 400 °C and subsequent
cold freezing at −20 °C; the whole process was repeated
twice. The powder was dried and homogenized.

4.4 Photocatalytic
Dye Degradation
Photocatalytic
degradation is one of the methods for the removal of environmental
carcinogenic pollutant from wastewater. Here, we have reported application
of the GO-Ag nanocomposite as a photocatalyst under UV–Vis
irradiation for degradation of methylene blue dye solution.40

Batch experiments were performed for both
GO and GO-Ag nanocomposite using 30 mL of methylene blue (MB) solution
(30 mg/L). In a dye solution, the catalyst was added (1 mg/L) and
kept in the dark for 30 min to establish adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. Subsequently, these solutions were exposed to UV–visible
radiations producing UV light of 254 nm. Aliquots (3 mL) were taken
out at fixed time intervals and centrifuged, and the absorbance was
recorded at 664 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer.

4.5 Characterization Techniques
For the
X-ray diffraction measurement, the GO-Ag nanocomposite was sonicated
using a probe-type sonicator for 15 min to avoid any possible agglomeration.
XRD measurements were carried out using a Rigaku Ultima IV with a
10 mm Cu target slit and using a Cu Kα radiation of 1.54 Ǻ
wavelengths. Raman spectral measurements were carried out with 514
nm excitation wavelength (argon ion laser source) using a Renishaw
PLC Raman spectrometer. For FTIR analysis, the samples were dried,
ground with KBr pellets, and analyzed on a Bruker Tensor 37. For SEM
(Carl Zeiss, Germany) analysis, a droplet of solution of nanoparticles
was transferred on a clean glass slide (1 cm × 1 cm), and micrographs
were taken randomly at various locations with the help of an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV. TEM images were obtained using a FEI Philips Morgagni
268D at 100 kV acceleration voltages. Electrochemical measurements
of the nanocomposite were performed on a computer-controlled CH-Instrument
electrochemical workstation (model no. CHI 600D (SPL)) using three-electrode
system (Ag/AgCl (1 M) as a reference electrode, platinum as a counter
electrode, and glassy carbon as a working electrode) in dimethylformamide
(DMF) and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte.
The dielectric properties of the nanocomposite were studied using
an Agilent 4284-A precision LCR meter at room temperature in the frequency
range from 75 kHz to 5 MHz. The electrodes on the pellets surfaces
were made by polishing and then coating with silver paste. The thermoluminescence
(TL) property of the synthesized nanocomposite was studied by irradiating
with gamma radiation of 365 nm wavelength. After the desired exposure,
TL curves were recorded on a Harshaw TLD reader (model 3500), taking
5 mg of the sample each time at a fixed heating rate of 5 K/s. Photocatalytic
dye degradation was executed on a Systronics UV–Visible double
beam spectrophotometer operated at 1 nm resolution from 200 to 900
nm at room temperature.
