Selective formation of positional isomers and accordingly
tuning
the physicochemical properties of small conjugated organic molecules
through structural isomers is an effective crystal engineering for
a fascinating successful delivery of thermally stable and photophysically
exciting compounds. By small structural skeleton changes, the single
crystal of the naphthalenemaleonitrile isomers is found to exhibit
a drastic change in crystal packing array, which in turn is found
to tune the thermal and physicochemical properties. The α-isomer
(A) forms the “herringbone packing” (HP) due to peri-interaction-sensitive C–H···(Ar)π
(Ar = naphthalene ring) interactions, and the β-isomer (B) forms the “bricklayer packing” (BP) due to π(C≡N)···π(Ar) stacking
interactions. These two positional isomers have revealed insight of
molecular packing-dependent structure–property relationship.
In this report, we show that a simple modification of relatively less
common weak interactions, such as C–H···π(Ar)
↔ π(C≡N)···π(Ar), through
the preparation of isomers, can lead to a drastic change in crystal
packing (HP ↔ BP). Also, this report demonstrates that by a
small structural diversity, one can obtain significant changes in
the physicochemical properties like melting behavior, enthalpy, entropy,
and electrical properties in the solid state. Therefore, it transpires
from this study that structural isomer provides a useful complement
to intermolecular nonbonding interactions as a tool to design new
promising materials.

1 Introduction
Modulation in the molecular
packing of organic materials has sparked
intensive research in the field of crystal engineering. The intermolecular
interaction is found to be the controlling factor for crystal packing
with different molecular shapes.1−7 For example, intermolecular interactions in solid-state packing
give an idea to improve the electrical characteristics of the materials
based on different packings.1−5 Therefore, growing interest in crystal engineering, which accommodates
various aspects of chemistry, biology, physics, engineering, material
science, and pharmaceuticals,8 has become
the need for the development of new materials for technological applications.9,10 As crystal engineering is to design and tune intermolecular interactions
through changing functional group and conjugated backbone, some important
packing motifs like herringbone (HP),11,12 bricklayer
(BP) π-stacked,13,14 and lamellar (LP) slipped π-stacked15−17 in organic crystals play an important role in organic electronic
devices and have been of intense research in current years (see Table 1).18−20 As documented
in Table 1, an interchange
between two different interesting crystal packings through modulation
of weak intermolecular interactions has been of great interest among
crystal engineers in the last decade. Among them, Curtis and co-workers
discussed the correlation between solid-state packing and carrier
transport to explain organic semiconductors.21 Theoretically, a co-facial π stacking structure is expected
to provide effective orbital overlaps, leading to better carrier transport.
Although pentacene, which shows HP packing mode with C–H···π
intermolecular interactions in spite of π–π stacking,
is the classical example showing high organic field-effect transistor
(OFET) performance,19 when π–π
stacking is taken into consideration, it is found to be much more
efficient for the transporting of charge carriers than HP.20,21 Rubrene22 and 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)pentacene23 are good examples of π–π
stacking materials in the literature that are used to enhance the
OFET efficiency. Several efforts have been made to promote the self-assembly
process in such a way to prevent C–H···π
interactions and to obtain π–π stacking interaction
or lamellar packing.24−26

Table 1 Compilation of Important Literature
in Which Transformations in Crystal Packings due to Change in Intermolecular
Interactions Are Reported
Crystal structure modification with desired properties
as well
as with the desired packing can be achieved, not only by the functionalization
of the molecules but also by choosing different isomer configurations.27,28 Studies of isomeric compounds are important as discussed by Takimiya
and co-workers for transistor performances.29 It has been reported in the literature that the molecules which
have similar chemical structures and electronic properties but different
crystal structures are more efficient in charge transportation.30 Ghiassi et al. studied four bio-based cyanate
ester isomers and described the crystal structure and thermodynamic
characteristics of melting, as well as showed a considerable variation
in enthalpy, entropy, and melting points despite their high level
of chemical similarity.31 However, it is
challenging to predict the solid-state order of the crystals but quite
interesting to make small changes in structural skeleton which directly
affect crystal packing drastically by complex intermolecular interactions.32 Anthony and co-workers carried out this beautiful
task by substitution at the peri-position of acenes.33

Modification at the peri-position may be responsible
for obstructing
the edge-to-face interaction with a favorable π–π
stacking arrangement, improved ambient stability, and excellent carrier
mobility.24 Moreover, the crystal structure
and intermolecular interactions greatly influence the physicochemical
and mechanical properties like thermal stability and solubility.34,35 Katritzky and co-workers explained well that crystal packing significantly
affects the physicochemical properties.36

The physicochemical properties of organic conjugated molecules
are expounded through molecular formulas, crystal packing, and crystal
compositions.37,38 In relation with the study of
the physicochemical properties, examination of the structure and the
accordingly changing properties39 of novel
π-conjugated materials is an exciting option to develop organic
sensors,40 OFETs,41a,41c and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).41b,41d

Efforts in the direction of crystal packing pattern modification
through intermolecular interaction and the accordingly tuning physicochemical
and thermophysical properties are being devoted both theoretically
and experimentally.42−44 Therefore, the architecture of essential building
blocks by desired crystal packing array with desired material properties
is demanding.

In this paper, we use a careful selection of peri-position
substitution
in naphthalene moiety-based derivatives (Chart 1) to demonstrate the powerful effect of weak intermolecular interactions,
which directly control the different crystal packing of α- and
β-isomers. This report points to the involvement of C–H···π(Ar)
↔ π(C≡N)···π(Ar) weak interactions
in the alteration of crystal packings in two molecular isomers.

and B (β-Isomer: 2-Amino-3-(((E)-naphthalen-2-ylmethylene)amino)maleonitrile). The Figure Also Depicts
the Difference in Peri-Interaction in Isomers
The main points discussed in this paper are (i)
different interaction
preferences in isomers which leads to significantly different packing
modes and (ii) its effect on the thermophysical properties, resistivity,
and other properties. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), two-dimensional
(2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (correlation spectroscopy, COSY),
nuclear over-hauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), thermogravimetric
analysis with differential scanning calorimetry (TGA-DSC), and electrical
conductivity measurement are presented here. Hirshfeld surface analysis
is also used to substantiate the SCXRD data and help us in quantifying
different modes of interactions.45

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystal Structure Analysis
The crystal
structures of the two isomers of 2-amino-3-(((E)-naphthalen-1-ylmethylene)amino)
maleonitrile (A) and 2-amino-3-(((E)-naphthalen-2-ylmethylene)amino)maleonitrile
(B) have been determined by SCXRD. A crystallizes
in the monoclinic with space group P21/c, while B crystallizes in triclinic
with P1̅ space group. In both cases, the asymmetric
unit of the crystal lattice contains two crystallographically independent
molecules, which are held together by the N8H···N3
hydrogen bond in A and the N4H···N7 hydrogen
bond in B, as shown in Figure 1 and Table 2.

black represents the carbon atom. The dotted line shows the presence
of the H-bonding interaction between two molecules in the same asymmetric
unit, which acts like a lock between two molecules as discussed in
the text.

The crystal structures of A and B, therefore,
are stabilized by intermolecular NH···N hydrogen bonding
(N8–H8B···N3 = 2.138 Å for A; N8–H8B···N4 = 2.154 Å for B), in which the two units are found to be closer in A compared to B as revealed by the shorter H-bonding
distance. In addition to these classical H-bonding interactions, several
other weak intermolecular interactions are found to contribute significantly
in stabilizing the crystal packing of these two isomers. On considering
naphthalene ring as the head (H) part and diaminomaleonitrile (DAMN)
as the tail (T) part, these two molecules are oriented in the opposite
direction, i.e., H −T···T −H arrangement.

The H-bonding interaction acts as an interconnected lock in the
same asymmetric unit between the two molecules, as shown in Figure 2. Additionally, it
forms one-dimensional planer sheets held together by multiple symmetrical
hydrogen bonds. The molecular packing mode is very important for the
analysis of the interactions between adjacent molecules. There are
two kinds of main packing motifs as shown in Figures 3 and 4.

where the purple sphere represents the naphthalene ring.

the (C≡N)π···π(Ar) intermolecular
interaction between molecules of two successive layers leading to
bricklayer packing. (b) Overall 2D bricklayer packing (down the b axis) in B due to interlayer π···π
stacking interaction.

Molecular packing in A shows predominant
C–H···π
(edge-to-face: 2.89 Å) noncovalent bonding intermolecular interactions.
In A, molecules are arranged in an antiparallel slip-stacked
manner where units are connected through an edge-to-face fashion and
a loosely bound interaction, which is termed as herringbone packing
(Figure 3a). The other
H-bonding distances which interconnect two asymmetric units are N4–H4A···N′7
= 2.215 Å and N8–H8A···N′6 = 2.634.

In contrast, (C≡N)π···π(Ar) =
3.38 Å intermolecular interaction predominates in B, leading to a planar molecular arrangement as depicted in Figure 4. The other interconnected
hydrogen bonds in B which stabilized the moiety are N8–H8A···N′4
= 2.248 Å, N8–H8A···N′6 = 2.341
Å. Several other shorts contacts with the conjugated ring that
help to pack the molecules in a bricklayer fashion are C13···C′17
(Ar), C5(Ar)···C′28 = 3.382 Å. Hydrogen-bonded
planar sheets are arranged on top of each other by stronger (C≡N)π···π(Ar)
stacking having a separation of 3.38 Å with a head-to-tail-type
arrangement (Figure 4a). The π···π interaction occurs in the
entire packing that arranges the molecule in a planar sheets (2D bricklayer
packing). With these kinds of different intermolecular interactions
(C–H···π in A vs C≡N···π
in B), distinct crystal packings are observed (schematic
representation given in Supporting Information (SI) Figure S5).

A closer look at the molecular orientation
in A reveals
that the peri-interaction (i.e., C11–H···C1–H
interaction) tilts the naphthalene ring with respect to the DAMN moiety
about 11.4° dihedral angle, as depicted in Figure 5a.

Figure 5 Dihedral angle between the naphthalene ring
and DAMN moiety: (a)
11.4° for A and (b) ∼0.3° (planar) for B.

This distorted structure of A can
now afford a minimized
interaction between the electron-deficient groups (C28≡N6···C′23–H23
= 2.629 Å) of the naphthalene ring. This type of interaction,
in principle, leads to loose packing of HP type. Though scanty, a
similar HP packing via edge-to-face (in C–H···π)
interaction is reported only for trimethylsilyle derivative.46B is almost planar having a 0.3°
dihedral angle, as shown in Figure 5b, due to the absence of any peri-interaction steric
factor. A consequence of this planar structure leads to the absence
of C28N6···C′23-H23 interaction in B. Introduction of a functional group is reported to modulate the
packing, as shown in the case of anthradithiophene having an acenes-type
central ring, by Anthony and co-workers,46 Yamashita et al.,14a and Wurthner et
al.14b Our investigation suggests that
simply by changing the position of the functional group, one can modulate
the interaction to a large extent, which leads to a drastic change
in overall packing (SI Figure S5) and furthermore
their unit cell volume presented in (SI Figure S6). Further, a comprehensive collection of reports depicting
weak interactions leading to popular crystal packings (such as HP,
BP, etc.) published in high-impact journals in recent times are tabulated
in SI Table S4.

2.2 Hirshfeld Surface Analysis
SCXRD
structure analysis clearly indicates that the difference of weak interaction
brings drastic changes in overall packings. Hirshfeld surface analysis
helps us to understand the intermolecular interactions in depth. It
also contributes toward better cognition of packing interactions and
contribution of molecular interactions quantitatively, which are responsible
for molecular architecture in a crystal. Hirshfeld surface is mapped
over the dnorm (interatomic distances
normalized by the size of the atoms via the van der Waals radii) properties,
as shown in Figure 6 along with their full two-dimensional fingerprint plots. Relative
percentage contributions of various intermolecular interactions to
the Hirshfeld surface areas for both isomers are also presented in
SI Figure S7.

Figure 6 View of Hirshfeld surfaces
of A and B mapped with dnorm (left) and full 2D
fingerprint plots derived from the same surfaces (right). The numbers
1, 2, and 3 show close contact (N–H···N≡C)
in both isomers and are discussed in the text.

Hirshfeld surfaces of an asymmetric unit of A and B show close contacts as a function of
color contour. The
surfaces are represented as transparent for the visualization of the
molecule. The white color on the surface represents distances equal
to van der Waals radii, while the red and blue colors represent the
shorter and longer distances of the sum of van der Waals radii, respectively,
on the Hirshfeld surfaces. The large red 1(N′–H′···N6≡C28/C28≡N6···H–N), 2(N′–H′···N3≡C15/C15≡N3···H′–N′),
and 3(N′–H′···N2≡C13/C13≡N2···H′–N′)
regions in both isomers represent hydrogen-bonding interactions, which
are relevant in the dnorm maps for these
two isomers. These interactions in the fingerprint can be seen as
symmetrical spikes at de + di ≅ 2.13 Å for A, and a center
spike is observed at a di + de distance of ∼2.2 Å, which indicates the
H···H contact observed in B, as expected
for the strong hydrogen bond in B. It is found that H···H,
N···H/H···N, and C···C
weak intermolecular interactions are more in B compared
to A, while the C···H/H···C,
N···C/C···N, and N···N
interactions are dominant in A. Four small red spots
are labeled for α-isomer, while only three red spots are labeled
for B. There is no C28≡N6···H′–C′
interaction in β-isomer (planar molecule). The N′–H′···N3≡C15/C15≡N3···H′–N′
contacts shown by the red spot 2 and N′–H′···N2≡C13/C13≡N2···H′–N′
shown by the red spot 3 are dominant for both the isomers,
with highest contributions of 12.6% in B and 10.0% in A, of the total Hirshfeld surface area. Moreover, B has (C≡N)π···π(Ar) stacking interaction,
which is stronger than the weak C–H···π
interaction in A. Therefore, we can conclude from Hirshfeld
analysis that B has a higher contribution of intermolecular
interactions compared to A. Perhaps, this might be a
predominant reason for why B has a higher melting point,
which will be discussed shortly.

2.3 Correlation Spectroscopy (COSY) and Nuclear
Over-Hauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR Studies
So far,
we have examined the single-crystal structures of two isomers using
SCXRD, a direct experimental observation. The interaction analysis
by Hirshfeld surface also provides same inferences. However, it is
also interesting to study the behavior of the molecules in solution.
The 2D NMR spectroscopy gives an understanding of long-range coupling
interactions in the molecule. Particularly, the coplanarity, conformational
aspects (such as gauche, trans, etc.), and bond proximity are studied
well by this spectroscopy. Long-range coupling interactions of A and B isomers in solution were investigated
by 1H, COSY, and NOESY spectroscopy studies, as shown in Figure 7. The chemical shifts
of Ca–H protons are found to be at 8.98 and 8.36
ppm in COSY in CDCl3 for A and B, respectively. This significant difference in the chemical shift
(Δδ = ∼0.62 ppm) from α- to β-isomer
is quite informative. The shifting of Ca–H proton
toward downfield in the case of A indicates that it is
more deshielded and therefore gives a clear indication about the different
orientations of naphthalene ring even in solution. As we have discussed
in the SCXRD study, the naphthalene ring in A is found
to be twisted ∼11.4° with respect to the DAMN moiety (see Figure 5a). This makes the
Ca–H proton less hindered and therefore deshielded.
This Ca–H proton in both isomers gives no off-diagonal
peak, which means that this proton does not couple with any adjacent
proton. Moreover, all of the aromatic protons of B isomer
are upfield in comparison to A. The reason for this shifting
can be explained that B is a planar molecule so that
there is proper conjugation and more electron density on the naphthalene
ring part in the case of B.

Figure 7 COSY (above) and NOESY
(below) (2D NMR) spectra of A and B in CDCl3.

But in A, due to its distorted structure
or peri-interaction
hindrance, there is no proper conjugation and less electron density
on naphthalene ring, therefore protons are deshielded as shown in
the COSY spectra (Figure 7). Hirshfeld surface analysis shows that number 4 interaction (vide Figure 7a) in A, not present in B, is also
reflected in the COSY NMR spectra as the aromatic protons are also
deshielded in A. We have observed from the NOESY spectra
of A that there were strong interactions between Ca–H and Cb–H protons. Moreover, no
interaction between Ca–H and Cd–H
can be explained that these protons are not in the same plane, which
indicates the peri-steric hindrance in solution also. In the case
of the NOESY spectra of B, an interaction between the
Ca–H and Cb–H protons occurs and
no interaction occurs between Ca–H and Cc–H protons, which supports the planar structure of B. Therefore, it appears from the solution-state 2D NMR studies that
the interaction observed in the solid-state is present in solution
as well.

2.4 Thermal Studies (DSC and TGA Analyses)
To understand the impact of the difference in crystal packing and
the consequence of variation in weak interactions on the thermal properties,
detailed thermal studies are performed. Thermal studies allow deeper
insights about the stability, melting point, and phase behavior of
these structural isomers. Our SCXRD studies established that α-
and β-isomers possess a small change in the molecular structure,
which leads to a significant difference in molecular packing, resulting
in a big difference in melting points as will be discussed here. The
equilibrium melting temperature of A is found to be 170
°C, while that of B is much higher (248 °C),
as can be seen in the DSC endotherm provided in Figure 8.

Figure 8 (a) DSC endotherm traces showing the melting
of A and B. The immediate stiff rise in
the DSC curve for B at higher temperature indicates decomposition.
(b) TGA graph showing
the decomposition temperatures of A and B.

Despite the similarity of these compounds, a difference
of 78 °C
in melting points is exciting and deserves a detailed analysis. Our
group reported several examples in which thermal behaviors of compounds
are found to depend on packing in crystal and intermolecular interactions.47 Lian et al. also described the effect of molecular
geometry on melting-point-related properties like enthalpy and entropy,44c while Ghiassi et al. reported the relation
of melting behavior with crystal packing for the isomer of cynate
ester.31 From the DSC thermogram, we have
calculated the thermodynamic parameters associated with the melting
process, according to eq 1, and the data are presented in Table 3. 1  where ΔHm and ΔSm stand for enthalpy and
entropy changes of the melting process, respectively.

Table 3 Thermal Parameters of A and B: Melting Temperature Tm, Enthalpy (ΔHm/kJ/mol), and Entropy
(ΔSm/kJ/(mol K)) and Decomposition
Temperature (Td) of Two Isomers, Obtained
from DSC Studies and TGA Studies
isomer	Tm (°C)	ΔHm (kJ/mol)	ΔS (kJ/(mol K))	Td (°C)	
A	170	30.71	6.92 ×
10–2	230	
B	248	24.14	4.63 × 10–2	260	
According to eq 1,
higher melting point of a crystal is because of the higher enthalpy
change of melting, smaller entropy change of melting, or both. Table 3 shows that there
is a significant difference in entropy of melting. In the case of A, ΔHm and ΔSm are obtained from DSC results as 30.7 kJ/mol
and 6.92 × 10–2 kJ/K–1, respectively.
However, there is a considerable decrement observed in ΔHm (24.14 kJ/mol) and ΔSm (4.63 × 10–2 kJ/K–1) for B. A smaller entropy change of melting is directly
related to the crystal packing. B has a strong head-to-tail
packing (bricklayer packing) and therefore in a more compacted form.
In contrast to β-isomer, A has higher entropy change
of melting (6.92 × 10–2 kJ/K–1) and has a low melting point as the α-isomer has a comparatively
less compact herringbone packing. By consideration of ΔSm data, we can conclude that B is
more ordered and stable, which is also further supported by SCXRD
and Hirshfeld surface analysis data. Thermogravimetric analysis was
also performed to find the thermal stability of A and B isomers (Figure 8b). The decomposition temperatures of A and B were found to be 230 and 260 °C, respectively, indicating
that B is more stable than A. However, very
close values for decomposition and melting temperature for B are further interesting, indicating the temperature sensitiveness
of the B isomer. This significant difference in melting
point and thermal stability is due to the different type of packing
and interactions in the crystal packing of A and B isomers.

2.5 Thin-Film Fabrication from the Precursors
of A and B Isomers
Since electrical
resistivity is an anisotropic property (i.e., depends on the orientation
of the molecule in solid), it is expected that these two isomers will
have different responses considering the fact that they have predominantly
different molecular packing. It was reported that the physical properties
like electrical resistivity and magnetic properties are governed by
dimensional control of intermolecular interactions.48 The thin films of A and B isomers
of 2-aminonaphthalenemaleonitrile can therefore contribute to design
various microelectronic, optoelectronic devices.

2.6 Two-Probe-Based Current (I)–Voltage (V) Characteristics
The
two-probe I–V measurements
for both these films were carried out by taking bottom-most contact
on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates and top contacts
made onto the material. Contacts having an area of 1 cm × 1 cm
with graphite paste-conducting carbon tape were used. Figure 9 shows the two-probe I–V plots for two different films,
which show the typical weak diode nature between FTO and A/B-isomers.

Figure 9 (a, b) Two-probe dark and light I–V characteristic of A/B-isomers/FTO
films with experimental setup.

FTO is an n-type semiconductor,
and the corresponding
films of A/B-isomers coated on it are p-type in nature. It can be observed from Figure 9 that the values of threshold
voltage in the forward bias are somewhat higher for the B isomer film compared to the A isomer in the presence
of light compared to the dark. Zener breakdown occurs at a greater
reverse bias for A isomer/FTO film (ca. −1.6 V)
than for the B isomer/FTO film (ca. −2.1 V). Therefore,
the B isomer films fabricated on FTO glass substrate
can have better p-type nature; the compact encrusted
structure of B isomer films gives rise to a low leakage
path and good diode characteristics, whereas A isomer
has more leakage path of carriers, leading to comparatively lean diode
characteristics.

2.7 Four-Probe-Based Current (I)–Voltage (V) Characteristics
Since A and B isomers-coated films showed a weak Schottky
barrier diode with the low-lying FTO conducting glass substrate, the
four-probe technique was important for determining the resistivity
of these two films. The contacts were therefore made by the spring
action of the four probes (see inset of Figure 10).

Figure 10 Four-probe I–V measurement
with experimental setup.

The four-probe technique (DFP-RM, SES Instruments,
India) was utilized
for resistivity measurement of two different films. About 0.2 cm spacing
was kept between these adjoint probes. Two probes are used to apply
current across the samples, while voltage changes with respect to
current have been noted through the other two probes in the four-probe
setup. A linear relationship between current and voltage for the fabricated
films of A and B isomers is found to be
observed and is shown in Figure 10.

The deposited films of A or B isomers
have thickness much lesser than 0.25 mm, and the correction factor
is applied to obtain exact values of resistivity, which are found
to be 1.2048 × 106 and 1.4710 × 106 Ω cm for ρA and ρB films, respectively. Results of a comparative
study of the electrical and other physical parameters of the two isomers
are indicated in Table 4.

The lower electrical resistivity or the higher conductance
associated
with the stability of compound can be explained in relation to the
melting temperature. Therefore, we can clearly say that crystal packing
is of great importance and profoundly affects the electrical properties
like resistivity or conductivity.

3 Conclusions
We present here a strategy
to realize a high degree of control
over molecular packing using peri-interaction-sensitive positional
isomers. Just by changing the position of a functional group from
α to β position on naphthalene ring, one could alter the
molecular packing array from herringbone packing (HP)
to bricklayer packing (BP). This is attributed to the
peri-interaction which distorts the α-isomer from planarity
by about 11.4°, and the absence of peri-interaction is responsible
for the planar structure for the β-isomer. Further in-depth
studies of intermolecular interactions in these two isomers by combined
SCXRD and Hirshfeld surface analysis reveal that C–H···π(Ar)
is the primary interaction responsible for HP crystal
packing for A, while π(C≡N)···π(Ar)
stacking is the dictating interaction in B leading to the bricklayer
packing (BP). To the best of our knowledge, we have not
come across where such less common weak interactions (i.e., C–H···π(Ar)
↔ π(C≡N)···π(Ar)) alter a
crystal packing from a fundamentally important packing mode HP to BP or vice versa. Further, these positional
isomers are found to have drastically different thermophysicochemical
and electrical properties, which correlate with the different crystal
packing arrangement. A large difference in melting point reveals a
significant difference in both the enthalpy and entropy of these two
isomers. Furthermore, thin film of these isomers shows significantly
different electrical conductivity properties; while A shows a weak diode nature, B shows a strong diode nature.
The result provided here enhances the understanding toward how the
effect of packing pattern can control the thermodynamic and electrical
conductivity properties, which leads to the development of compounds
with desired characteristics of high-performance application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Method
Starting materials
such as α-naphthaldehyde, β-naphthaldehyde, and diaminomaleonitrile
(DAMN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received, while
all solvents were of AR grade and procured from either Sigma-Aldrich
or TCI. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on 500 MHz NMR (JEOL-500L) spectrometers, and the spectra are given
in SI Figures S1 and S2. Fourier transform
infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum-2 FTIR spectrometer
using KBr pellets in the 400–4000 cm–1 region,
and the spectra are given in SI Figure S3. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were done using a
PerkinElmer STA 6000 instrument under the nitrogen atmosphere at a
heating rate of 10 °C/min. Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) experiments were performed on Mettler STAR SW10.00 instrument
under the nitrogen atmosphere. The instrument was calibrated with
indium before measurement of samples. The samples were heated to 100
°C first at a rate of 10 °C/min to remove moisture, then
cooled to room temperature, and again heated below its decomposition
temperature at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.

4.2 Electrical Conductivity Measurements
The spin-coating method has been used for the preparation of thin
films, which has several merits such as convenience, low-cost equipment,
and faster operating system. The precursor’s sols were stirred
for 30 min at room temperature with a constant speed without any agitation.
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were cleaned in
the usual manner for the deposition of thin films by a spin coater.49a It is found to be a suitable and convenient
machine for obtaining uniform films on the glass substrate surface.
For conductivity measurement, the two different films of A and B isomers were fabricated onto FTO glass substrate
having an area of 3.5 cm × 1.5 cm (l × b) by using sol precursors prepared with acetonitrile in
the ratio of 1:10, at 2000 rpm for 2 min using a rotating vacuum pump.
About 10 drops of ligand sols in acetonitrile were taken carefully
with the help of a 0.5 mL syringe onto the center of a stationary
conducting glass substrate. This glass substrate was held firmly in
position by an ambient pressure. Due to the influence of the centrifugal
force, drops spread out across the substrate and the corresponding
solvents from the solution evaporated out to have a smooth continuous
film. The resulting films were annealed at ∼65 °C in air
for 25 min to remove the residual solvent, if any. These processes
were successively done to obtain uniform and pinhole-free films on
the FTO glass substrate (sheet resistance ∼ 10 Ω/sq).
The film thickness was determined by the trivial gravimetric method
using the formula t = (W2–W1)/Ad, where, “t” is the thickness of the film, ‘A’
is the area covered by the film, ‘d’ is the density
of ligand isomers (dA = 1.291
gcm–3, dB = 1.278 gcm–3), and W1 and W2 are the weight of the FTO glass
substrate before and after deposition, respectively.49b The coated films (tA = 2.685 × 10–5 and tB = 3.129 × 10–5 cm)
of different ligand isomers were studied for resistivity as well as
semiconducting behavior of electrical measurement done by semiconducting
characterization unit (KEITHLEY-4200 SCS). Therefore, the prepared
thin films have two different structures: A isomer sol/FTO
and B isomer sol/FTO and were subjected to studies of
diode characteristics in the dark and light by the current–voltage
measurement.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Routes Leading to the Preparation of A and B
4.3 Synthesis of Compounds (A and B)
A and B were synthesized
by dissolving DAMN (1 mmol, 108 mg) in ethanol, and then α-naphtaldehyde
(1 mmol, 156.18 mg) or β-naphthaldehyde (1 mmol, 156.18 mg)
was added and stirred (Scheme 1). The reaction mixture was then refluxed for 10 h for A and stirred at room temperature for 12 h for B, following a clear brown-colored solution in A (80%
yield) while the precipitate form in B (82% yield). Progress
of the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction mixture was filtered
and kept for crystallization (in ethanolic solution) by a slow evaporation
method at low temperature around 10–15 °C in a fridge.
Brown-colored crystals for both the isomers were obtained, suitable
for SCXRD within a week. The detailed characterization data and CHN
analysis reports are provided in SI Table S1. To study the crystallinity and pure phase, powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) of the two compounds was also performed, and the results are
presented in SI Figure S4.

4.4 Crystallographic Data Collections and Refinements
Crystal data for A were collected on an Oxford Diffraction
XCALIBUR EoS diffractometer using graphite monochromatized Mo Kα
radiation at 296 K (λ = 0.71073 Å), while those for the B isomer were collected on a Bruker Kappa APEX II diffractometer
having the same source of radiation at 200 K. The PXRD data were collected
on a Bruker D8-ADVANCE diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 (λ
=1.5406 Å; 1600 W, 40 kV, 40 mA) at a scan speed of 5° min–1. The structures were solved by direct methods and
refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 using SHELX-2016.50 While nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic
thermal parameters, all of the hydrogen atoms were geometrically fixed
and were allowed to refine using a riding model. The refinements were
converged to final values of R1 and wR2 0.1056, 0.0987 and 0.1692, 0.2861, respectively,
for A and B isomer. The reason for relatively
higher wR2 for B was found
to be the presence of twinning in crystal system, and also higher
angle reflections were found to be weak. The crystal data of B belong to a nonmerohedrally twinned crystal. The twin law
[−1 0 0, 0.463 1 0, 0 0 −1] was identified by the “TwinRotMat”
program and is used for the generation of HKL5 reflection format,
which was used for refinement. The percentage of twin is given by
a batch scale factor (BASF) of 0.17. This might be a reason for the
higher value of wR2. The small residual
peaks in the electron density map are due to outlier reflections as
a result of twinning, which are omitted from refinement. The final
refinement of these data gives a negligible residual peak. Also we
have tried a disorder model but did not provide better result. Relevant
crystal data are presented in Table 2, whereas other selected crystallographic data like
bond distance and bond angles are given in SI (Tables S2 and S3). Drawings were made using ORTEP-III, OLEX
II,51 and MERCURY.52
