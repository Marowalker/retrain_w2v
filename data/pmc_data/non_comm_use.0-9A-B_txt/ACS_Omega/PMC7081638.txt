According
to an indirect competitive immunoassay, six β-agonists
(clenbuterol (CL), salbutamol (SAL), ractopamine (RAC), terbutaline
(TER), mabuterol (MAB), and tulobuterol (TUL)) were detected by three
novel multiresidue immunosensors on the basis of the successful preparation
of bovine serum albumin (BSA)-RAC-CL-SAL multideterminant antigen
and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody. A new strategy was reported to detect
six β-agonists by combining nanotechnology, electrochemical
detection, and specific immune technology. At the same concentration,
the amperometric response for detection of six β-agonists was
in a sequence of GCE/GNP/SAL > GCE/GNP/RAC > GCE/GNP/CL. Detection
limits of six β-agonists show that the multiresidue detection
performance of the GCE/GNP/RAC immunosensor is better than those of
GCE/GNP/SAL and GCE/GNP/CL immunosensors. Three immunosensors manifest
superior properties with a wide linear range, low detection limit,
excellent reproducibility, and stability. The proposed GCE/GNP/RAC
immunosensor displays high accuracy and can be effectively used for
real sample detection.

==== Body
1 Introduction
β-agonists
are the derivatives of phenylethanolamines, which
are the generic term for a class of β-receptor stimulants.1−3 After being eaten by animals, they promote protein synthesis and
inhibit fat production during metabolism,4,5 which
increases the feed conversion rate, growth rate, and lean meat rate
by more than 10%.6,7 If people eat the meat containing
β-agonists, there will be palpitations, muscle fibrillation,
hand shaking, dizziness, fatigue, and other abnormal conditions, especially
for patients with hypertension, heart disease, hyperthyroidism, and
prostatic hypertrophy.8,9 Chromosome aberration and malignant
tumors may occur if consumed for a long time.10,11 Therefore, a highly sensitive multiresidue analysis method for rapid
detection of multiple β-agonists is urgently needed in the field
of food safety.

At present, the commonly used detection methods
can be divided
into chromatographic analysis, electrochemical analysis, and immunoassay.12−14 The shortcomings of the existing detection methods for β-agonists
are mainly manifested in the following: (1) Chromatographic analysis
is the main method for the determination of veterinary drug residues
of β-agonists, but it is not suitable for primary screening
because of its high cost and complex sample pretreatment. (2) The
weak selectivity of electrochemical analysis limits its application
in practical samples with complex composition. (3) Due to its specificity,
the traditional enzyme-linked immunoassay cannot simultaneously detect
and rapidly screen a variety of β-agonists, which is easy to
miss. (4) The maximum standard of β-agonists in food is low
in many countries, which requires high sensitivity of rapid detection
methods. The existing detection technology is not suitable for high
throughput rapid screening because of its limitations.

Electrochemical
immunosensors are a new class of sensors that combine
highly sensitive electrochemical sensing technology with highly specific
immunological techniques.15−17 Based on the specific binding
of the antigen and antibody, the electrochemical immunosensor analysis
can detect the change of the antigen–antibody conjugate and
convert the nonelectric signal into an electrical signal18,19 so as to realize the correlation between the electric signal and
the concentration of the substance to be tested, which is a relatively
advanced detection method and has broad application prospects in food,
environment, and other fields.20−22 Poo-arporn et al. prepared a
disposable electrochemical sensor for determination of RAC with a
detection limit of 13 nM (S/N = 3).23 A
disposable electroanalytical device for the competitive enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay of phenylethanolamine A (PA) was reported by Deng
et al. with a detection range of 0.005–60 ng·mL–1 and a detection limit of 2.6 pg·mL–1.24 Kang et al. developed a facile and sensitive
method for the detection of CL using a personal glucose meter, suggesting
a good linear correlation with the logarithm of the CL concentrations
in the range of 0.1–100 ng·mL–1.25 A novel ultrasensitive competition-type electrochemiluminescent
immunosensor was developed for detecting brombuterol with a low detection
limit of 0.3 pg·mL–1 and a wide linear range
from 0.001 to 500 ng·mL–1.26 Inspired by the merits of electrochemical immunosensors,
after the successful preparation of the BSA-RAC-CL-SAL multideterminant
antigen and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody, three multiresidue electrochemical
immunosensors were constructed in this work to detect six β-agonists
CL, SAL, RAC, TER, MAB, and TUL with a new strategy involving nanotechnology,
electrochemical detection, and specific immune technology.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Identification of BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
The UV–vis absorption spectra of 0.2 mg·mL–1 SAL, 1.0 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL, and 1.0 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL-SAL are shown in Figure 1. From Figure 1, the UV–vis absorption curves of BSA-RAC-CL
and BSA-RAC-CL-SAL are obviously different in the wavelength range
of more than 280 nm. The maximum absorption wavelengths of BSA-RAC-CL
and BSA-RAC-CL-SAL are 274 and 281 nm, respectively, and the maximum
absorption peak of BSA-RAC-CL-SAL moves to a long-wavelength region,
which proves that BSA-RAC-CL is successfully coupled with SAL.

1.0 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL, and 1.0 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL-SAL, (B) graphene/RAC complex, (C) graphene/CL
complex, and (D) graphene/SAL complex.

2.2 UV–vis Characterization of the Graphene/β-Agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) Complex
In order to study the interaction
between graphene and β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) on the surface
of electrodes, ultraviolet–visible spectrum (UV–vis)
analysis was performed on the β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) standard,
graphene, and graphene/β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) complex.
The results are shown in Figure 1B–D. A clean quartz slide was taken to simulate
the process of electrode surface modification. The slide surface was
dripped with 100 μL of graphene suspension and 50 μL of
0.2 g·L–1 standard solution of β-agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) (the ratio of graphene and standard solution was
the same as that of electrode modification). The slide was dried at
37 °C and then dispersed uniformly in redistilled water.

From Figure 1B, there
are a wide range of characteristic absorption peaks at 266.8 nm for
GNP and two characteristic absorption peaks at 221.6 and 273.2 nm
for the standard solution of RAC. The graphene/RAC complex showed
a weak absorption peak at 225.1 nm, which shifted to the right in
comparison with the characteristic absorption peak at 221.6 nm of
RAC. Compared with the GNP absorption curve, the absorbance of the
graphene/RAC complex increased gradually in the range of 216.0–266.8
nm, mainly due to the interaction between GNP and RAC. The absorption
peak of RAC at 273.2 nm is combined with that of GNP at 266.8 nm,
which results in the ultraviolet absorption peak of the GNP/RAC complex
appearing at 269.5 nm, which is close to half of the sum of two independent
absorption peaks (270.0 nm). The absorption peaks of GNP/RAC at 225.1
and 269.5 nm show that RAC has been bound to the surface of GNP.

Figure 1C shows
that there are characteristic absorption peaks at 210.0, 241.6, and
294.5 nm for CL standard solution, and there is no coincidence with
the characteristic peaks of GNP (266.8 nm). For the GNP/CL complex,
there are CL absorption peaks at 210 and 241.6 nm in the GNP/CL curve.
Due to the interaction between GNP and CL, there is a gentle absorption
peak in the range of 266.8–294.5 nm, which is a composite peak
of CL and GNP. It is proven that CL has been modified on the surface
of GNP.

As shown in Figure 1D, there are characteristic absorption peaks at 223.6
and 275 nm
for SAL standard solution. The GNP/SAL complex shows a weak absorption
peak at 223.6 nm, which is also the absorption peak of SAL. The absorption
peak of SAL at 275 nm is close to that of GNP at 266.8 nm, and the
two absorption peaks compounded with each other. As a result, the
ultraviolet absorption peak of GNP/SAL appears at 271.9 nm, which
basically coincides with half of the sum of the two independent absorption
peaks (270.9 nm). The absorption peaks of GNP/SAL at 223.6 and 271.9
nm prove that the GNP/SAL complex formed.

2.3 Detection
of Six β-Agonists by the Graphene/CL
Multiresidue Electrochemical Immunosensor
2.3.1 Characterization
Figure 2A shows
the CV curves for GCE,
GCE/GNP/CL, and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody immunization. From Figure 2A, the CV curve of
GCE indicates a pair of stable and obvious [Fe(CN)6]3–/[Fe(CN)6]4– redox peaks.
The redox current response of the electrode GCE/GNP/CL is much stronger
than that of GCE, which indicates that graphene has excellent electrochemical
properties and greatly improves the electron transfer rate on the
surface of the electrodes. After incubation of the GCE/GNP/CL electrochemical
immunosensor and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody, the peak current decreased
significantly due to the specific bonding interaction between CL and
anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody, indicating that the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody hindered the transmission of electrons.

Figure 2 (A) CV curves for (a)
GCE, (b) GCE/GNP/CL, and (c) anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody immunization. (B) EIS curves for (a) GCE, (b) GCE/GNP, (c)
GCE/GNP/CL, (d) GCE/GNP/CL/OVA, and (e) anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody
immunization. Effect of (C) anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody volume and
(D) incubation time on the DPV peak current.

Figure 2B describes
the EIS for GCE, GCE/GNP, GCE/GNP/CL, GCE/GNP/CL/OVA, and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody immunization. The electron transfer resistance on the electrode
surface is evaluated generally by its semicircular diameter in the
high-frequency zone. The larger the semicircular diameter, the more
difficult the superficial electron transfer and the higher the charge
transfer resistance. As shown in Figure 2B, the initial value of Z′ of GCE is 88 Ω, and the impedance value is 50 Ω.
The Z′ initial value of the graphene-modified
electrode (curve b) is 68 Ω, which moves to the left compared
with that of GCE (88 Ω). It is because the impedance value is
almost zero due to the change of the electrode material, which shows
that the electron transfer rate is very fast; that is, graphene can
effectively improve the electron transfer on the electrode surface.
The impedance values of GCE/GNP/CL (curve c), GCE/GNP/CL/OVA (curve
d), and anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody immunization (curve e) are 307,
507, and 782 Ω, respectively, which indicates that the specific
immune reaction between the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody and electrochemical
immunosensor has a great influence on the electronic conduction of
the electrode surface. The specific binding of the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody to the electrode surface seriously hinders the transmission
of electrons, thus proving the reliability of the specific detection
of the graphene/CL electrochemical immunosensor.

2.3.2 Optimization of Conditions
The
conditions involving the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody volume and incubation
time were optimized at 37 °C as shown in Figure 2C,D before detecting six β-agonists.
As depicted in Figure 2C, the peak current of DPV decreases with the increase of anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody volume in the range of 2–8 μL and then tends
to be stable, which indicates that the specific binding between the
anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody and electrochemical immunosensor was
saturated. Therefore, the optimal volume of the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody was identified to be 8 μL. As shown in Figure 2D, it is noticeable that the
peak current of the graphene/CL electrochemical immunosensor decreases
gradually as the incubation time increases to 40 min due to the specific
immune reaction between the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody and immunosensor.
After 40 min, the current value achieves a plateau, indicating that
the immune reaction was basically completed within 40 min. Thus, 40
min was the best incubation time.

2.3.3 Detection
of Six β-Agonists
Figure 3 records the
performance of the GCE/GNP/CL electrochemical immunosensor by DPVs
corresponding to different concentrations of β-agonists. As
demonstrated in Figure 3, after the first incubation, the peak current of DPV (curve b) of
the GCE/GNP/CL immunosensor was lower than that of the GCE/GNP/CL
(curve a), and then the peak currents of DPV (curves c, d, and e)
of the GCE/GNP/CL decreased steadily after incubation with a series
of different concentrations. Due to the graphene sheet prepared by
liquid-phase exfoliation with a large area, more CL can be combined
by π–π interaction and van der Waals force, and
then more anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibodies can be specifically bound
to the surface of the electrode after the first incubation. As a result,
the effective area of the electrode is greatly reduced, which hinders
the transmission of electrons and is consistent with the results from
EIS analysis. In addition, with the decrease in the concentration
of the β-agonist, the peak current of DPV decreases gradually
due to the competitive principle of the GCE/GNP/CL. The peak current
of DPV is proportional to the concentration of the β-agonist.

(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, and k corresponding to GCE/GNP/CL,

0 ng·mL–1, respectively). (B) SAL detected

immunosensor (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, and l corresponding
to GCE/GNP/CL, concentrations of 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 100,
50, 10, 5, 1, and 0 ng·mL–1, respectively).
(D) TER detected by the GCE/GNP/CL electrochemical immunosensor (a,
b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, and m corresponding to GCE/GNP/CL,
concentrations of 7000, 5000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10,
5, 1, and 0 ng·mL–1, respectively). (E) MAB
detected by the GCE/GNP/CL electrochemical immunosensor (a, b, c,
d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, and l corresponding to GCE/GNP/CL, concentrations
of 7000, 5000, 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 1, and 0 ng·mL–1, respectively). (F) TUL detected by the GCE/GNP/CL
electrochemical immunosensor (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, and
l corresponding to GCE/GNP/CL, concentrations of 7000, 5000, 4000,
3000, 2000, 1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, and 0 ng·mL–1, respectively).

The GCE/GNP/CL immunosensor
was used to detect six standard solutions
of β-agonists as shown in Table 1. From Table 1, the best linear ranges were TER and MAB followed by TUL,
CL, SAL, and RAC. The lowest detection limit was CL followed by SAL,
TER, TUL, MAB, and RAC. The anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody is a polyclonal
antibody, and the structures of CL and SAL are similar to those of
TER, MAB, and TUL, which enables the GCE/GNP/CL immunosensor to multiresidue
detect six β-agonists. The detection results of six standard
solutions of β-agonists show differences in the linear range
and detection limit. The factors affecting the detection of the immunosensor
mainly include the following aspects: (1) The selectivity of the polyclonal
anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody is relatively weak. (2) The relative
competitive strength of CL fixed on the surface of the immunosensor
is different from those of β-agonists in incubation solution.
(3) Large changes in β-agonist concentration lead to an imbalance
of competition. (4) The immunosensor interface may affect the binding
rate of the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody with CL on the electrode
surface.

by the GCE/GNP/CL Immunosensor

limit (ng·mL–1)	
CL	1–5000	0.992	0.1

TER	1–7000	0.990	0.2	
MAB	1–7000	0.991	0.3	
TUL	10–7000	0.992	0.2	
2.3.4 Reproducibility and Stability
To
measure the reproducibility of the GCE/GNP/CL immunosensor, six concentrations
of SAL were detected three times, and the relative standard deviations
of the GCE/GNP/CL immunosensor were 0.67, 0.71, 0.35, 0.43, 0.52,
and 0.46%, corresponding to the SAL concentrations of 0.5, 1, 5, 10,
50, and 2000 ng·mL–1, respectively, demonstrating
that the prepared immunosensor has satisfactory reproducibility. In
addition, the immunosensor was stored at 4 °C, and the current
response was measured three times a day for 7 consecutive days. The
relative standard deviation was less than 9%. In conclusion, the GCE/GNP/CL
immunosensor has a good reproducibility and stability in a relatively
long time.

2.4 Detection of Six β-Agonists
by the Graphene/RAC
Multiresidue Electrochemical Immunosensor
2.4.1 Detection
of Six β-Agonists
The GCE/GNP/RAC immunosensor was
used to detect six standard solutions
of β-agonists as shown in Figure S5 and Table 2. The
widest linear range is RAC and MAB followed by CL, TER, TUL, and SAL.
As shown in Figure 3 and Figures S3 and S5, at the same concentration, the amperometric
response for detection of six β-agonists was in a sequence of
GCE/GNP/SAL > GCE/GNP/RAC > GCE/GNP/CL. From Table 1, Table S2, and Table 2, it can be seen that
there is only one β-agonist (CL) with a detection limit of 0.1
ng·mL–1 in Table 1, four β-agonists (CL, SAL, RAC, and
TUL) with a detection limit of 0.1 ng·mL–1 in Table S2, and six β-agonists (CL, SAL,
RAC, TER, MAB, and TUL) with a detection limit of 0.1 ng·mL–1 in Table 2, which shows that the multiresidue detection performance
of the GCE/GNP/RAC immunosensor is better than those of GCE/GNP/SAL
and GCE/GNP/CL immunosensors. The three multiresidue immunosensors
based on the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody manifest outstanding performance
with a wide linear range and low detection limit, compared with the
previous different material-modified electrodes for RAC detection,
for example, Au/OMC/GCE (detection limit 1.49 ng·mL–1),27 3D MnO2/RGO@nickel foam
(detection limit 3.92 ng·mL–1),28 ATONPs/CNTs/GCE (detection limit 1.11 ng·mL–1),29 and MCF/CPE (detection
limit 3.38 ng·mL–1),30 which can be ascribed to the high specific area of the GCE/GNP/β-agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) caused by the nanoscale effect of the graphene,
increasing the loading capacity of the β-agonists.

Table 2 Detection Results of Six β-Agonists
by the GCE/GNP/RAC Immunosensor

SAL	50–5000	0.989	0.1	
RAC	1–7000	0.988	0.1

MAB	1–7000	0.996	0.1	
TUL	10–5000	0.993	0.1	
2.4.2 Analysis of Real Samples
Detection
of real samples is a key step to evaluate the practical application
ability of the immunosensor. The GCE/GNP/RAC immunosensor is selected
to detect CL and RAC in real samples. The pig lean, fat, or liver
sample was crushed and weighed (1 g) into a 10 mL centrifuge tube.
A standard solution of CL or RAC was added to the sample by a standard
addition method. Then 3 mL of acetonitrile–acetone extraction
solution (volume ratio 1:1) was added. The mixture was sonicated and
centrifuged for 20 and 5 min, respectively. The supernatant was transferred
into test tube, dried under nitrogen, and then mixed with 1 mL of
PBS (pH = 7.4). The extracts were dissolved and stored at 4 °C
until detection. The detection results of CL and RAC in real samples
by the GCE/GNP/RAC multiresidue immunosensor are shown in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.

6000	5545.4	6143.7	5522.4	5.6	95.6	
From Table 3, the
average recoveries of pig lean, fat, and liver samples are 96.4–106.0%
except the recovery (80.5%) of a sample, and the relative standard
deviations are 0.1–13.2%. In addition, from Table 4, the average recoveries of
pig lean, fat, and liver samples are 95.3–103.3% except the
recovery (87.6%) of a sample, and the relative standard deviations
are 0.2–14.6%. Therefore, the constructed immunosensor has
high accuracy and can be effectively used for real sample detection.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, based on
the preparation of a BSA-RAC-CL-SAL multideterminant
antigen, the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody was obtained successfully
by immunization, serum collection, and purification and preservation.
Using an indirect competitive immunoassay, three novel graphene/β-agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) multiresidue electrochemical immunosensors were
fabricated by nanotechnology, electrochemical detection, and specific
immune technology to accomplish the detection of six β-agonists
(CL, SAL, RAC, TER, MAB, and TUL). With the decrease in the concentration
of the β-agonist, the peak current of DPV decreases gradually
due to the competitive principle of the graphene/β-agonist (RAC,
CL, or SAL) electrochemical immunosensor, where the peak current of
DPV is proportional to the concentration of β-agonist. The amperometric
response for detection of six β-agonists was in a sequence of
GCE/GNP/SAL > GCE/GNP/RAC > GCE/GNP/CL with the same concentration,
and the detection performance of the GCE/GNP/RAC immunosensor is better
than those of GCE/GNP/SAL and GCE/GNP/CL immunosensors. The three
multiresidue immunosensors display attractive performance with a wide
linear range and low detection limit, which can be ascribed to the
high specific area of the GCE/GNP/β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL)
caused by the nanoscale effect of the graphene, increasing the loading
capacity of the β-agonists. The constructed immunosensor exhibits
high accuracy and can be applied to the detection of real samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
RAC,
CL, SAL, TER, MAB,

Control. Ractopamine hydrochloride, clenbuterol hydrochloride, salbutamol
sulfate, and Freund’s complete and incomplete adjuvants were

All other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. Redistilled

samples were purchased from a local supermarket.

4.2 Apparatus
Electrochemical measurements
were performed by using a CHI600E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai
Chenhua Apparatus Co., Ltd., China). A three-electrode system was
used with platinum (Pt) wire, Ag/AgCl, and glassy carbon as the counter
electrode, reference electrode, and working electrode, respectively.
The UV absorption spectrum was measured by using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).

4.3 Preparation
of the BSA-RAC-CL-SAL Multideterminant
Antigen
Salbutamol sulfate (143.6 mg, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved
in 6 mL of anhydrous methanol and the solvent was evaporated under
pressure to obtain a yellow oily salbutamol base. Then the white solid
was obtained by centrifugation after dissolving in 12 mL of anhydrous
ethanol, adding 68 mg (0.6 mmol) of glutaric anhydride, and stirring
at room temperature for 6 h.

The white solid was dissolved in
mixed solvents (4 mL DMF and 4 mL 1,4-dioxane), and 78.6 μL
of tributylamine (0.3 mmol) was added, stirred in an ice bath for
10 min, added with isobutyl chloroformate (43.2 mL, 0.3 mmol), and
stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The above solution was added
drop by drop to 10 mL of cold PBS solution containing 50 mg of BSA-RAC-CL
and reacted overnight at room temperature. Finally, the BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
multideterminant antigen was obtained by dialysis in PBS solution
at 4 °C for three days and changing dialysate twice a day.

4.4 Preparation of the Anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL Antibody
4.4.1 Immunization
2 mL of 1 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL-SAL multideterminant antigen was mixed
with the same amount of Freund’s complete adjuvant and emulsified.
Each rabbit was vaccinated with 0.25 mg of above immunogen. Then the
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant was mixed with 2 mL of 1 mg·mL–1 BSA-RAC-CL-SAL multideterminant antigen and emulsified.
The emulsification method, immune site, and immune dose were the same
as before, and the immunization was strengthened every 2 weeks. Protocols
for the animal studies were approved by the Regulations of Experimental
Animal Administration, State Committee of Science and Technology of
the People’s Republic of China.

4.4.2 Serum
Collection
After three booster
immunizations, 10 mL of venous blood was collected. Standing at room
temperature for 30 min and then standing at 4 °C for 30 min,
the supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 30 min.

4.4.3 Purification and Preservation
10
mL of normal saline was added to 10 mL of serum, and then 5 mL of
(NH4)2SO4 saturated solution was
added drop by drop, mixed fully for 30 min, and then centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 20 min to remove the precipitate. 30 mL of ammonium sulfate
saturated solution was added to the supernatant, fully mixed, and
kept for 30 min. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation for
20 min at 3000 rpm. The precipitation was dissolved in 20 mL of normal
saline, added with 10 mL of ammonium sulfate saturated solution, and
mixed fully for 30 min. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation
for 20 min at 3000 rpm.

The precipitate was dissolved in 10
mL of normal saline and dialyzed overnight in pure water and then
dialyzed in normal saline at 4 °C for 24 h, changing the dialysate
three times. The SO42– was examined with
1% barium chloride solution until there was no SO42– in the dialysate. The dialysate was centrifuged,
and the supernatant was taken and stored at low temperature.

4.5 Construction of Three Graphene/β-Agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) Multiresidue Electrochemical Immunosensors
A bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was polished with 0.05 μm
alumina powder and sonicated in ethanol/distilled water (volume ratio
1:1) and distilled water consecutively for 30 s and then dried at
room temperature. The treated GCE was coated with 4 μL of graphene
suspension (GNP)31 and 2 μL of 0.2
g·L–1 RAC, CL, or SAL standard solution. The
graphene and β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) were fully combined
and fixed on the GCE surface at 37 °C overnight. Furthermore,
the modified electrode was incubated in 0.05% ovalbumin solution to
block the active sites on graphene that were not bound by RAC, CL,
or SAL. Finally, the graphene/β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) multiresidue
electrochemical immunosensor was prepared by washing the modified
electrode with PBS buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4).

4.6 Electrochemical Measurements
In order
to characterize the changes of electrochemical behavior on the surface
of electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) were used to determine the responses of electrodes
at different stages during the preparation and detection of immunosensors,
including the bare GCE, graphene-modified electrode, β-agonist
hapten-modified electrode, and electrode after the antibody immune
response. The CV curve was measured with the scanning range of −0.2
to 0.8 V and scanning rate of 100 mv·s–1 in
PBS buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4) of 2 mM K3[Fe(CN)6]/K4[Fe(CN)6]. The EIS spectrum was
determined with scanning frequencies of 0.01–106 Hz and pulse amplitude of 5 mV·s–1 in 0.1
M KCl, 5 mM K3[Fe(CN)6], and 5 mM K4[Fe(CN)6] solution.

4.7 Optimization
of Conditions
Optimizing
the amount of anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody in incubation solution:
In 50 μL of incubation solution (anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody
and PBS), antibodies were added with volumes of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and
12 μL. The immunosensor was immersed in incubation solution
for 30 min. After incubation, the electrode surface was washed with
PBS and analyzed by DPV.

Optimizing the incubation time: The
optimum volume of anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody was added to the incubation
solution (anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL antibody and PBS) with a total volume
of 50 μL. The electrode was incubated, and the peak current
of DPV was measured per 5 min.

4.8 Detection
of β-Agonists
In
order to investigate the multiresidue detection performance, the graphene/β-agonist
(RAC, CL, or SAL) immunosensor was applied to the quantitative DPV
detection of RAC, CL, SAL, TER, MAB, and TUL β-agonist standard
solutions. Under the optimum conditions, the immunosensor was placed
in 50 μL of a series of β-agonist standard solutions (β-agonist,
quantitative antibody, and PBS) (1–7000 ng·mL–1) and incubated at 37 °C for the optimal time. After incubation,
the graphene/β-agonist (RAC, CL, or SAL) immunosensor was washed
with PBS and put into PBS buffer solution (0.1 M, pH 7.4) of 2 mM
K3[Fe(CN)6]/K2[Fe(CN)6]. The peak current difference of DPV (ΔI = Ix – I0, where Ix is the sample detection corresponding peak
current and I0 is the blank sample detection
corresponding peak current) was used to establish a linear relationship
with the sample concentration. The voltage range was −0.2 to
0.5 V, and the pulse amplitude was 50 mV. The preparation and detection
process of the multiresidue immunosensor based on the anti-BSA-RAC-CL-SAL
antibody are described in Scheme 1.
