A large number of clinically used
drugs and experimental pharmaceuticals
possess the N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) structural core. Previous reports have described the reaction
of this motif with dichloromethane (DCM), a common laboratory solvent
used during extraction and purification, leading to the formation
of an undesired quaternary ammonium salt byproduct. However, the kinetics
of this reaction under various conditions have not been thoroughly
described. Here, we report a series of experiments designed to simulate
the exposure of DMT to DCM that would take place during extraction
from plant material, biphasic aqueous work-up, or column chromatography
purification. We find that the quaternary ammonium salt byproduct
forms at an exceedingly slow rate, only accumulates to a significant
extent upon prolonged exposure of DMT to DCM, and is readily extracted
into water. Our results suggest that DMT can be exposed to DCM under
conditions where contact times are limited (<30 min) with minimal
risk of degradation and that this byproduct is not observed following
aqueous extraction. However, alternative solvents should be considered
when the experimental conditions require longer contact times. Our
work has important implications for preparing a wide-range of pharmaceuticals
bearing the DMT structural motif in high yields and purities.

1 Introduction
A wide-variety of bioactive
compounds contain the N,N-dimethyltryptamine
(DMT) structural motif (Figure 1). The parent compound
DMT (1) is the primary hallucinogenic component of ayahuasca—an
Amazonian tisane used in traditional medicine and for religious purposes.1 There is a growing interest in the therapeutic
potential of DMT because of recent clinical data demonstrating that
ayahuasca produces rapid antidepressant effects in humans that resemble
those of the prototypical fast-acting antidepressant ketamine.2−5 Furthermore, DMT is capable of producing behavioral effects in rodents
relevant to the treatment of depression and post-traumatic stress
disorder.6 Other psychedelics possessing
the DMT structural core, such as psilocybin (2) and ibogaine
(3), have also demonstrated therapeutic potential for
treating various neuropsychiatric disorders including depression,
anxiety, and addiction.7,8 Taken together, these data suggest
that psychedelics possessing the DMT core structure may have value
as medicines and cannot simply be labeled as drugs of abuse.9

Figure 1 Chemical structures of DMT and related compounds. The
DMT structural
motif is found in a variety of bioactive natural products, known drugs,
and experimental therapeutics.

In addition to the classical serotonergic psychedelics, a
variety
of other bioactive compounds contain the DMT structural motif. These
include the triptan drugs sumatriptan (4), zolmitriptan
(5), and rizatriptan (6) (Figure 1)—compounds that are
widely prescribed for treating migraines and cluster headaches as
well as the 5-HT6 ligands EMDT (7), MS-245 (8), and ST1936 (9).10 The
latter compounds are still in the experimental phase but have shown
great promise in preclinical models and in clinical trials for improving
cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer’s disease and
depression.11 Because of the ubiquity of
the DMT structural motif in molecules of medicinal importance, it
is imperative to identify methods for their preparation and purification
that maximize yield and purity while minimizing cost.

During
the course of our studies regarding the synthesis and biological
evaluation of DMT derivatives, we became aware of reports detailing
the reaction of DMT with dichloromethane (DCM) to form N-chloromethyl-N,N-dimethyltryptamine
chloride 10 (Scheme 1).12−14 These findings have caused some chemists to question
the appropriateness of using DCM in the synthesis, work-up, or purification
of DMT derivatives, despite the fact that DCM possesses many desirable
traits like being one of the only commercially available low boiling
solvents that is nonflammable.15 One common
alternative to DCM is diethyl ether, but the latter can be quite hazardous
due to its low flash point (−45 °C), low autoignition
temperature (180 °C), and ability to form peroxides.16 Chloroform is another solvent commonly used
as a replacement for DCM, but it is far from perfect. In the presence
of a base, it can form dichlorocarbene, which is known to react with
indoles and amines.17 Additionally, it
causes a variety of adverse health effects that are less likely to
be caused by DCM.18,19 Finally, both diethyl ether and
chloroform are significantly more expensive than DCM (circa 1.5×).
Therefore, despite the possibility of amines reacting with DCM through
an SN2 reaction, this solvent remains attractive from safety
and economic standpoints.19

Scheme 1 Reaction
of DMT with DCM
DMT reacts with DCM via an SN2 reaction to produce N-chloromethyl-N,N-dimethyltryptamine chloride 10.

While there have been several studies reporting
the reactivity
of DCM with amines, such reactions are highly substrate dependent.20,21 Tertiary amines appear to be the most susceptible to reactions with
DCM, though the reactivity of secondary amines has also been reported.20 Secondary amines stored in DCM transiently form
an N-chloromethyl product that establishes a rapid
equilibrium with the iminium chloride. In the presence of excess amine,
the major product formed is the symmetrical aminal.20 As the half-life of triethylamine in DCM is on the order
of hours to days,21 we hypothesized that
the reaction of DMT with DCM might be negligible under typical conditions
used to either extract the natural product from plant sources or produce
it synthetically. Here, we confirm that DMT does form 10 when stored in DCM for extended periods of time as previously reported.12−14 However, we find that under typical experimental conditions, the
reaction of DMT with DCM does not negatively impact the reaction yield
or increase the risk of contamination by 10. We conclude
that DCM is a suitable solvent for the work-up and purification of
DMT and related analogs and that 10 is unlikely to be
useful as a diagnostic impurity characterizing batches of DMT produced
by specific clandestine laboratories, as previously suggested.14

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Analytical Standards
First, we prepared
pure DMT and 10 as described previously
for use as analytical standards.6,13,14 For reference, the 1H NMR and LC–MS (liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry) spectra are presented in Figure 2. Characterization data for 1 and 10 were consistent with previous reports.6,12

(A) and 10 (B). Insets depict LC–MS
traces and mass spectra for each compound.

2.2 DMT Degradation in Pure Solvent
Alkaloids
are commonly extracted from plant material using DCM.22 To mimic such conditions, we dissolved a DMT free base
in DCM and observed the formation of 10 via 1H NMR as a function of time.23 While previous
reports have described the formation of 10 after extended
reaction times, the rate of its formation was previously unknown.13,14 By comparing the integrations of the peaks corresponding to DMT
(1) with those corresponding to 10, we could
determine the rate of the reaction. In a pure solvent, the reaction
of 1 with DCM is quite clean yielding 10 as the only observable product by 1H NMR (Figure 3A) or LC–MS (data not
shown). After 1 h, the percentage of 10 in the mixture
was 0.8%, and it reached 38% after 4 days (Figure 3B). Crystals of 10 were observed
to precipitate around day 2 when the starting concentration of DMT
was 10 mg/mL. The pseudo-first-order rate constant k1 for this reaction was calculated to be 1.21 × 10–5 s–1 and is comparable to that previously
reported for the reaction of DCM with trimethylamine.21 Like trimethylamine, DMT reacts approximately 35×
faster with DCM than triethylamine, but only 2× as fast as the
secondary amine piperidine.21 Compared
with the bulkier tertiary amine N-methylpiperidine,
DMT reacts nearly 10× as fast highlighting the importance of
steric effects in the reaction of amines with DCM.21 Though DMT and trimethylamine react faster with DCM than
most amines (with the exception of quinuclidine), this reaction is
still quite slow when compared with their reaction with methyl iodide.
For example, trimethylamine reacts with methyl iodide approximately
3000× faster than it does with DCM.21,23 Notably, when chloroform was used as the solvent, no appreciable
decomposition of DMT (1) was observed (data not shown).
When the reaction between DMT and DCM was carried out at −20
°C, the amount of 10 formed was less than 1% as
determined by NMR after 4 days. While the rate of formation of 10 is quite slow in DCM, care should be taken when lengthy
extraction protocols are required. In such cases, chloroform may be
a more appropriate solvent choice.

quantify the molar ratio of 1 to 10. (B)
Quantification of the peaks in A demonstrates that 10 reaches 38 mol % after 4 days.

2.3 DMT Degradation under Biphasic Basic Work-Up
Conditions
While the rate of formation of 10 in DCM is relatively slow, appreciable amounts were observed after
several days. However, it is quite uncommon for reactive tertiary
amines to be left in solvent for multiple days at a time. Therefore,
we were interested in assessing the formation of 10 under
more typical experimental conditions, namely, those corresponding
to a biphasic aqueous work-up. Because of the partitioning between
the organic and aqueous phases, one might expect to form 10 at an accelerated rate because of the dynamic removal of the ammonium
salt product from the organic layer where the SN2 reaction
occurs. In fact, Brandt and co-workers have reported that a basic
aqueous work-up using DCM following the synthesis of DMT (1) resulted in the formation of 10, which constituted
4% of the total peak area in the LC-UV trace.13 As Brandt and co-workers did not precisely quantify the formation
of 10, we subjected DMT to DCM/NaOHaq biphasic
work-up conditions and monitored the formation of 10 in
both layers as a function of time using LC–MS with selective
ion monitoring (SIM). In our hands, we observed that the rate of DMT
degradation under biphasic conditions is comparable to that in pure
DCM (Figure 4A,B).
By 24 h, 5% of 10 was observed in the aqueous layer,
comparable to the 4% observed in pure DCM conditions. Importantly,
we discovered that 10, likely because of its ionic nature,
partitions almost exclusively into the aqueous phase, resulting in
undetectable amounts of 10 contaminating the DMT dissolved
in the organic phase (Figure 4B).

Figure 4 Formation of 10 under basic biphasic work-up conditions.
(A) Formation of 10 in the aqueous phase as a function

ratios of 10 and an internal standard (caffeine) and
comparing those values to a calibration curve. (B) Combined LC–MS
traces using SIM (masses = 189, DMT; 237, 10; 195, caffeine)
of the aqueous and organic phases after 24 h of biphasic work-up conditions.
The presence of 10 was only detected in the aqueous layer.
(C) Unpurified 1H NMRs taken in CDCl3 following
the synthesis and 30 min biphasic basic aqueous work-up of DMT (1) using three different solvents. Comparable purity of DMT
was obtained, regardless of the solvent used during the work-up. Isolated
yields following crystallization as the fumarate salt (2:1 DMT/fumarate)
are indicated.

Because of fear of forming
impurity 10, others have
preferred the use of chloroform to DCM for extracting DMT free base.
However, chloroform is known to form dichlorocarbene under basic conditions,
such as those employed in aqueous work-ups involving amines.17 Therefore, we wished to directly compare the
yields and purities of synthetic DMT subjected to basic biphasic work-up
conditions utilizing either DCM, chloroform, or diethyl ether. The
work-ups were carefully timed such that the solvent was completely
removed 30 min following the initial exposure of DMT to solvent. Inspection
of the unpurified 1H NMRs revealed that 10 was unobservable following aqueous work-up regardless of the organic
solvent employed (Figure 4C). This fact makes it unlikely that 10 can be
used as a diagnostic impurity when trying to identify DMT produced
by clandestine laboratories using DCM in their syntheses. After crystallization
as the fumarate salt, the synthetic DMT produced using these three
distinct work-up conditions was judged to be analytically pure (via 1H NMR, and LC–MS). Furthermore, the yields of the final
product were comparable (79–86%), regardless of the solvent
used during the work-up. Thus, we conclude that DCM/NaOHaq is a perfectly suitable extraction system for the work-up of synthetically
produced DMT, as long as the contact times are minimized (<30 min).

2.4 DMT Degradation Following Purification via
Chromatography
Basic amines such as DMT (1)
are often purified via flash chromatography with the most common solvent
system being 9:1 DCM/MeOH with 1% NH4OHaq. In
fact, similar conditions produced 10 from an extract
of Acacia confusa, and the authors
concluded that its formation was an artifact of the isolation conditions.12 Following chromatography using this solvent
system, amines are often left to sit in the collected fractions for
a period of time, and thus, we were interested to measure the conversion
of DMT to 10 in 9:1 DCM/MeOH with 1% NH4OHaq (Figure 5A,B). After 1 h, the percentage of 10 in the mixture
was 2% and had reached 6% by 24 h, comparable to previously seen quantities
at 24 h. The reaction proceeded under pseudo-first-order conditions
at a comparable rate to that of DMT in pure DCM, and thus, it would
appear that the addition of MeOH and NH4OHaq has very little effect on the rate of the reaction of DMT with DCM.
However, we recommend that fractions containing DMT be concentrated
within 1 h or stored at −20 °C following column chromatography
using 9:1 DCM/MeOH with 1% NH4OHaq as the solvent
system to minimize any potential for degradation.

Quantification of the peaks in A demonstrates that 10 reaches 6 mol % after 24 h.

3 Conclusions
Here, we have demonstrated
that 1 will form 10 in the presence of DCM
as described previously.12−14 However, the rate of this reaction
is exceedingly slow under most
common experimental conditions, and significant amounts of this impurity
do not accumulate when contact times are limited (<30 min) or when
cryogenic temperatures are used. Therefore, concerns regarding the
use of DCM during the preparation of DMT (and likely other related
dimethyltryptamine analogs) are not warranted. It has been previously
suggested that forensic teams could use 10 as a diagnostic
impurity to identify clandestine laboratories using DCM in their syntheses
of DMT. However, we think that this possibility is unlikely due to
the readily extractable nature of 10 in water as well
as the slow rate of reaction between 1 and DCM. Although
there are still environmental concerns with using chlorinated solvents
such as DCM, this study has shown that its use has no effect on the
purity or yield of the final DMT product as compared to other common
laboratory solvents. Dimethyltryptamine and related analogs have high
medicinal value, and our work answers some fundamental questions regarding
their economical preparation in excellent yields and purities.

4 Methods
4.1 Materials
The
DCM (ACS reagent grade,
stabilized), chloroform (HPLC grade), and all other reagents used
in these studies were purchased from Fisher Scientific and used without
purification. The concentration of the ammonium hydroxide used in
the chromatography experiments was 28–30%.

4.2 Synthesis of DMT (1)
To an ice-cold solution
of tryptamine (0.60 g, 3.1 mmol) and glacial
acetic acid (0.88 mL, 15 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in MeOH (48 mL) was added
sodium cyanoborohydride (0.40 g, 6.4 mmol, 2.1 equiv) followed by
37% formaldehydeaq (0.64 mL, 7.9 mmol, 2.6 equiv). The
reaction was stirred at room temperature for 5 h, at which time the
mixture was transferred equally to three separate vials. Concentration
under reduced pressure afforded an unpurified solid, which was dissolved
in either DCM, diethyl ether, or CHCl3 (25 mL) and diluted
with 1.0 M NaOHaq (75 mL). The phases were separated and
the aqueous phase was extracted twice with solvent (25 mL). The organic
extracts were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield a colorless oil.
The unpurified oil was dissolved in acetone (5 mL) and added dropwise
to a boiling solution of fumaric acid (0.059 g, 0.50 mmol, 0.50 equiv)
in acetone (15 mL). A precipitate formed immediately. The solution
was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered. The white solid
was dried under reduced pressure to yield the pure compound as the
fumarate salt (2:1 DMT/fumaric acid) (DCM: 0.207 g, 0.084 mmol, 83%;
CHCl3: 0.199 g, 0.081 mmol, 79%; diethyl ether: 0.215 g,
0.87 mmol, 86%). TLC Rf (DMT free base)

4.3 Synthesis of N-Chloromethyl-N,N-dimethyltryptamine Chloride (10)
The DMT free base [0.050 g, 0.26 mmol; see below
for a procedure for preparing the free base from the DMT/fumarate
(2:1) salt] was dissolved in DCM (5 mL) to give a concentration of
10 mg/mL (0.05 M) The vial was blanketed with N2 and stored
in the dark. After 5 days, the precipitate that had formed was filtered,
rinsed with DCM and dried under reduced pressure to yield 10 as an off-white solid (0.027 g, 0.076 mmol, 19%). 1H
NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 11.1 (br
s, 1H), 7.6 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.4 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.3 (s, 1H), 7.1 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 7.0 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz), 5.5 (s, 2H),
3.7 (t, 2H, J = 8.1 Hz), 3.3 (s, 6H) 3.2 (t, 2H, J = 8.1 Hz) ppm; 13C NMR (100 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 136.2, 126.5, 123.7, 121.3, 118.6,
118.2, 111.7, 107.7, 68.1, 62.1, 48.9, 18.3 ppm; IR (diamond, ATR)

866, 755, 727 cm–1. LC–MS (ES+) calcd for C13H18Cl2N2+, 237.12; found, 237.22 (M+).

4.4 Conversion of DMT/Fumarate (2:1) to the Free
Base
DMT/fumarate (2:1) (0.20 g, 0.82 mmol) was basified
using 1.0 M NaOHaq (30 mL) and extracted twice with diethyl
ether (20 mL). The organic extracts were combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure
to yield DMT free base (0.11 g, 0.58 mmol, 71%).

4.5 DMT Degradation in Pure Solvent
The
free base of DMT (as prepared above) was dissolved in either DCM or
CHCl3 to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL (0.05 M). The
vial was blanketed with N2 and stored in the dark. Aliquots
were taken at various time points (1 h, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, and
4 days) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Care was taken to
ensure that the mixture was homogenous before aliquots were taken.
The unpurified samples were dissolved in 0.6 mL of DMSO-d6 and 1H NMR spectra were obtained. The aliquot
taken after 4 days was also subjected to analysis by LC–MS
to confirm the formation of 10.

4.6 DMT Degradation
under Biphasic Basic Work-Up
Conditions
The free base of DMT (as prepared above) was dissolved
in DCM to give a concentration of 10 mg/mL (0.05 M). To this solution
was added an equal volume of 1.0 M NaOHaq. The vial was
blanketed with N2 and stored in the dark. Aliquots were
taken at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 1 day from the aqueous layer,
neutralized with 2.0 M HClaq, and subjected to analysis
by SIM LC–MS using caffeine as an internal standard. Aliquots
from the organic layer were taken at the same time points, concentrated
under reduced pressure, diluted with methanol, and subjected to analysis
by SIM LC–MS using caffeine as an the internal standard. Standard
curves were prepared by comparing SIM peak integrations for increasing
concentrations of purified DMT/fumarate (2:1) or 10 relative
to a constant concentration of caffeine as an internal standard.

4.7 DMT Degradation under Column Chromatography
Conditions
The free base of DMT (as prepared above) was dissolved
in 9:1 DCM/MeOH with 1% NH4OHaq to give a concentration
of 10 mg/mL (0.05 M). The vial was blanketed with N2 and
stored in the dark. Aliquots were taken at 5 min, 15 min, 30 min,
1 h, and 1 day, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The
unpurified samples were dissolved in 0.6 mL of DMSO-d6, and 1H NMR spectra were obtained. An aliquot
taken after 1 day was also subjected to analysis by LC–MS to
confirm the formation of 10.
