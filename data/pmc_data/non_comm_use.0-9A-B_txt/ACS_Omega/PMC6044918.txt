Pristine
trivanadate (LiV3O8) and doped lithium
trivanadate (LiV3–xMxO8, M = Zn/Co/Fe/Sn/Ti/Zr/Nb/Mo, x = 0.01/0.05/0.1 M) compounds were prepared by a simple
reflux method in the presence of the polymer, Pluronic P123, as the
chelating agent. For comparison, pristine LiV3O8 alone was also prepared in the absence of the chelating agent. The
Rietveld-refined X-ray diffraction patterns shows all compounds to
exist in the layered monoclinic LiV3O8 phase
belonging to the space group of P21/m. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows the particles
to exhibit layers of submicron-sized particles. The electrochemical
performances of the coin cells were compared at a current density
of 30 mA/g in the voltage window of 2–4 V. The cells made with
compounds LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8 show a high discharge capacity
of 245 ± 5 mA h/g, with an excellent stability of 98% at the
end of the 50th cycle. The second cycle discharge capacity of 398
mA h/g was obtained for the compound LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, and its capacity retention was found to be 58% after
50 cycles. The electrochemical performances of the cells were correlated
with the electrical properties and the changes in the structural parameters
of the compounds.

Introduction
Secondary lithium ion
batteries with high energy density, power
density, and long cycling stability are considered as the heart of
the growing mobile technology and future electric vehicles. For intensive
commercial applications, drawbacks such as costly battery materials
and the safety issues associated with them have to be addressed. Layered
structured cathode materials such as lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8), vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), and other vanadium derivatives have good scope for lithium ion
battery technology because of their low cost, high energy density,
and better safety features.1−5 LiV3O8 (LVO) is a nonlithiated cathode material
in which the lithium ions can freely intercalate into and deintercalate
from the LVO’s layered structure, exhibiting better structural
stability than V2O5 and other vanadium derivatives.6−9 It has a layered monoclinic structure with a space group of P21/m, reported by Wadsley in
1957.10 It consists of V–O layers
arranged one above the other made up of two interconnected units by
corner-sharing oxygen atoms, such as the VO6 octahedra
unit and VO5 trigonal bipyramid units, providing structural
stability.11−13

However, practical batteries with LVO electrodes
show capacity
degradation and poor rate performance because of their low electrical
conductivity.14 This was significantly
overcome by means of cation doping such as Na, K, Cu, and Ag in the
lithium site and Mo, Si, Mn, Ni, Cr, and so forth in the vanadium
sites.15−22 But the clear role of doping on the electrical property of the compound
LiV3O8 and its influence on the electrochemical
performance of the cell have not been reported in any of the literature.
Research on the inter-relation between the oxidation states of metal
ions, the role of ionic and electronic conductivities of the compound,
and the electrochemical performance of the battery is the need of
the hour for the betterment of battery materials. Recently, our group
reported on the correlation between the electrical and electrochemical
performance of the cathode materials, LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2 and LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2.23,24 In the present work, lithium
trivanadate and LiV3–xMxO8 (M = Zn/Co/Fe/Sn/Ti/Zr/Nb/Mo) compounds
with dopants of different oxidation states were prepared at different
levels of doping x = 0.01/0.05/0.1 M. The changes
in the electrical properties of the compound upon doping were explored.
The materials were prepared by a very simple and cost-effective Pluronic
P123-assisted reflux method. Studies on the doping effect of Zn/Fe/Sn/Nb
at the vanadium site of LiV3O8 have not been
reported elsewhere.

Results and Discussion
Structure and Morphology
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of LVO-P, LVO-WP, and doped compounds (0.05 M level of doping) are
shown in Figure 1a,b
(Figure S1a,b for 0.01 and 0.1 M level
doped compounds, respectively). The XRD patterns of all compounds
correspond to the layered monoclinic crystalline phase with space
group P21/m.13−15 The lattice parameter values for LVO-P and LVO-WP were found to
be a = 6.700 Å, b = 3.625 Å,
and c = 12.096 Å and a = 6.619
Å, b = 3.578 Å, and c =
11.939 Å, respectively. The lattice parameters “a”, “b,” and “c” were found to be in the range of 6.516–6.772,
3.485–3.677, and 11.835–12.241 Å, respectively,
for doped compounds and are given in Table 1. The lattice parameter values of all compounds
were found closely matched with JCPDS card no. 72-1193.

On comparison with LVO-P, the shift in the peak corresponding to
the (100) plane either toward the higher or lower 2θ angle (Figure 2) and significant
changes in the intensity of the (100) plane was observed for all doped
compounds. Shifting of the peak corresponding to the (100) plane toward
lower 2θ angle indicates the increase in the interlayer distance d100 and vice versa (Table S1). The increase in d100 could
be better for the Li+ ion insertion and reinsertion, which
will lead to better electrochemical performance. On comparison with
LVO-P, the shift in the peak corresponding to the (100) plane toward
the lower 2θ value was observed for the compounds LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, and LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, as shown in Figure 2d. The interlayer distance value (d100) was found to be 6.352, 6.356, 6.366, and 6.370 Å for the compounds
LVO-P, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, and LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, respectively. The XRD pattern of the compound LiV2.9Co0.1O8 shows a very low interlayer
distance value (d100 ≈ 5.951 Å),
which may result in poor electrochemical performance. All compounds
show minor peaks at 2θ ≈ 22°, corresponding to the
LixV2O5 phase (5–10%),
which is commonly observed in the LiV3O8 compound
prepared through any of the reported methods,25−30 and are considered as an active phase in LiV3O8, which helps in improving the electrochemical performance of the
battery.13 No other impurity phases were
observed at any of the doping level.

Figure 3 shows the
morphology of the selected compounds, LVO-P, LVO-WP, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, and other 0.05 M level doped compounds. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analysis shows the particles to have submicron-sized particles.
Rod-shaped structures can be clearly observed for the compound LVO-P
and Zn, Zr, Sn, Fe-doped compounds ranging in length from 4 to 10
μm. The irregular-shaped particles were observed for LVO-WP.
Changes in particle sizes were observed upon doping. The BET surface
area and pore volume were found to be 0.68, 0.57, 1.20, 1.11, and
1.01 m2/g and 0.16, 0.13, 0.28, 0.26, and 0.23 cm3/g for the compounds LVO-P, LVO-WP, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.99Fe0.01O8,
and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, respectively.
The morphologies of 0.01 and 0.1 M level of doped compounds were also
found to have rod-shaped submicron-sized particles (images not shown).

Raman Spectroscopy and Electrical Studies
Raman and
electrical studies were carried out for the parent and selected doped
compounds based on their better electrochemical performance (to be
discussed under galvanostatic studies).

Raman analysis is considered
as a more suitable method to investigate the effect of dopants on
the LiV3O8 crystal lattice. The Raman spectra
of the select compounds are shown in Figure 4a,b. For LVO-P and LVO-WP, the observed band
at 773 cm–1 is related to the atomic motions of
the corner-sharing oxygen among the VO6, VO5, and LiO6 polyhedrons of LiV3O8.31 The Raman bands at 990 and 969 cm–1 could be attributed to the V–O stretching
vibrations of VO5 pyramids. The weak vibrations of the
B1g and Ag symmetry species of LiV3O8 were observed at 540 and 477 cm–1, respectively.32

Figure 4 Raman spectra for (a)
LVO-P and LVO-WP and (b) compounds LVO-P,
LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8.

The changes in the peak
position and relative intensities between
the peaks for doped compounds shown in Figure 4b indicate doping effect. The minor peak
corresponding to the LixV2O5 phase was observed for all compounds (indicated by * symbol),
as discussed earlier in the XRD section. The vibrations of the B1g and Ag symmetry species were shifted to a lower
wave number region in the order of LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, LiV2.95Zr0.01O8,
and LiV2.95Fe0.01O8. This indicated
the rapid formation of VO5 and VO6 polyhedrons
and thus a little distortion of the crystal lattice upon doping32 because the ionic radii of doping ions are greater
than that of V5+. Moreover, the intensity ratio between
the two peaks at 990 and 773 cm–1 were found to
be in the order of LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 > LiV2.99Fe0.01O8 > LiV2.95Sn0.05O8 > LVO-P compound. This behavior suggests that the formation rate of VO5 and
VO6 polyhedrons of V3O8– layers was much faster than the superposition rate of V3O8– layers linked by the interlayered
Li+ ions in LiV2.95Zr0.01O8.31,32

Electrical Studies
On the basis
of the electrochemical
performances (to be discussed later), electrical studies were conducted
for the selected compounds LVO-P, LVO-WP, LiZr0.01V2.99O8, LiSn0.05V2.95O8, LiFe0.01V2.99O8, and other
doped LiV2.95M0.05O8 (M = Zn/Co/Fe/Ti/Zr/Nb/Mo)
compounds by means of ac impedance, four-probe method, and transference
number studies.23,24Figure 5a represents the complex impedance plot for
LVO-P, LVO-WP, LiZr0.01V2.99O8, LiSn0.05V2.95O8, and LiFe0.01V2.99O8 taken at room temperature (303 K) in the
frequency range of 42 Hz to 1 MHz. The Nyquist plot shows the overlapping
of two semicircles related to the parallel combination of a resistor
and a capacitor. High-frequency semicircle is attributed to the grain,
and low-frequency semicircle is related to the grain boundary effect.23 The bulk resistance (Rb) of the sample was calculated by the intercept of the high-frequency
semicircle on the x-axis. The electrical conductivity was calculated
using the conductivity formula σ = l/RbA, where “l” and “A” are the thickness
and area of the pellet, respectively (Table 2) and the values were verified with the conductivity
values calculated from the mid-frequency plateau region in the conductivity
spectra (Figure S2). For comparison, the
dc four-probe conductivity value was also measured from the V/I spectra (Figure S3) and matched with the impedance analysis. This validates
our measurements. The compound LVO-P shows 1 order of higher electrical
conductivity (10–6 S/cm) than the compound LVO-WP
(10–7 S/cm). The electrical conductivity of doped
compounds was in the order of ∼10–6 S/cm.

Simple and well-known wagner polarization
method was used to find
the ionic and electronic transference numbers (ti and te) for all as-prepared compounds.23,24 The change in current (I) was measured by applying
a steady dc potential of 50 mV across the pellets. It was found that
the initial conductivity values calculated from the observed current
was decreasing with increasing time, before getting saturated. Significant
differences were observed in the case of the percentage of ionic and
electronic conduction, as calculated from the transference number
measurements (Figure 5b) using the formula 1  where “σ0”
and “σα” are the initial and
saturated conductivity values, respectively. The difference between
the initial and saturated conductivity values gives the value of the
ionic transference number.

Whereas the compound LVO-P showed
81% of ionic and 19% of electronic
conductivity, the compound LVO-WP was found to have 74% of ionic and
26% of electronic conductivity. A very good mixed conductivity was
observed in the case of compounds LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8 with ∼60% of ionic and ∼40% of electronic conductivity.
For all other doped compounds, LiV2.95M0.05O8 (M = Zn, Co, Fe, Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo), mixed conductivity
was observed, as given in Table 2.

Electrochemical Analysis
Cyclic Voltammetry
(CV)
Cyclic voltammetry is one of
the well adopted technique to understand redox potentials and complement
the galvanostatic cycling profiles of cathode materials.33−35Figure 6a shows the
second cycle CV plots for the compounds LVO-P and LVO-WP. During intercalation,
broad peaks were observed at 2.9 and 3.0 V for the compounds LVO-P
and LVO-WP, respectively. The shift in the anodic peak toward the
lower potential side in the case of LVO-P indicates the better kinetics
for lithium deintercalation. Whereas the cathodic peak 2.7 V refers
to single-phase reaction of lithium intercalation at tetrahedral sites,
the peak at 2.4 V refers to lithium intercalation at octahedral sites
resulting in two-phase transformation between Li3V3O8 and Li4V3O8.36−38 The cathodic peak at 2.3 V expected due to the slow kinetic reaction
as seen in many reports was not observed in the present work. This
indicates the absence of any V3+ ion dissolution in the
electrolyte. The cathodic peak at 2.6 V, usually observed due to the
presence of Li0.3V2O5, was not observed for
both the compounds.13 The anodic/cathodic
peak around 3.4/3.2 V observed in the case of LVO-P shows a trace
of Li0.3V2O5 because of different
energy sites for lithium ions.

Figure 6 Comparative second cycle CV plots of cells
made with (a) LVO-P
and LVO-WP, (b) LVO-P, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, and LiV2.99Fe0.01O8 (scan rate: 0.058 mV/s).

In Figure 6b, the
comparison of the second cycle CV plots (for compounds selected based
on their high specific-discharge capacity and better cycling stability,
to be discussed in the galvanostatic charge–discharge section)
shows that the anodic peaks were shifted to lower potentials in the
order of LVO-P, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8,
LiV2.99Fe0.01O8, and LiV2.99Zr0.01O8. The cathodic peaks were found to
shift to higher potentials in the same order as mentioned above. This
indicates the compound LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 to have better lithium diffusion kinetics. The CV of compound LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 shows an anodic peak around
2.5 V, which indicates easy accessibility of lithium sites during
deintercalation.39 As seen in Figure 7a, the anodic peak
at 2.5 V was suppressed in the case of 0.05 and 0.1 M level of zirconium
doping. Irrespective of dopants, a similar trend was observed for
all compounds (Figure 7a–h). This indicates the accessibility of lithium ion sites
to be affected by the level of doping. The anodic and cathodic peaks
around ∼3.6 V in the case of all doped samples show deintercalation
and intercalation of lithium ions, respectively, in the octahedral
lithium site of the LiV3O8 host structure.36−38

Figure 7 Second
cycle CV plots of cells made with (a) LiV3–xZrxO8, (b)
LiV3–xSnxO8, (c) LiV3–xFexO8, (d) LiV3–xZnxO8, (e)
LiV3–xCoxO8, (f) LiV3–xTixO8, (g) LiV3–xNbxO8, and
(h) LiV3–xMoxO8 (x = 0.01/0.05/0.1 M); scan
rate: 0.058 mV/s.

In the case of LiV3–xZrxO8 compounds, the anodic and cathodic
peaks were shifted to lower and higher potential sides, respectively,
in the case of 0.01 and 0.05 M levels of doping, when compared to
0.1 M level of doping (Figure 7a). This indicates that doping more than 0.05 M of zirconium
at the vanadium site results in poor lithium diffusion kinetics. The
cathodic peaks at ∼3.2 and 3.4 V were observed in the CV plot
of LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 (indicated by
arrow marks in Figure 8a), but not seen in the case of other two levels of doping. The above
peaks were due to the presence of the Li0.3V2O5 phase, holding different energy sites for lithium ions,40−42 as discussed in XRD (indicated by * symbol in Figure 1b). Similar cathodic peaks belonging to the
Li0.3V2O5 phase were also observed
in the case of other doped samples, depending on the type of doping
and doping level (Figure 7b–h). For LiV3–xSnxO8 compounds (Figure 7b) and in the case
of other doped samples as in Figure 8, expected anodic/cathodic peaks were observed, indicating
good lithium diffusion at all levels of doping.

profiles and (b) cycling
stability for LVO-P and LVO-WP.

Charge–Discharge Studies
Figure 8a shows the second cycle charge–discharge
curves of cells made with LVO-P and LVO-WP. During the discharge,
a clear two-step intercalation process was observed. In the case of
LVO-P, the plateau regions around 2.7 and 2.4 V during the discharge
refer to the lithium intercalation at tetrahedral and octahedral sites,
respectively, of the LiV3O8 structure and were
in accordance with the cathodic peaks observed in CV.36−39 Cycling stability could be observed in Figure 8b. The 2nd and 50th cycle discharge capacity
values are given in Table 3. The compound LVO-P was found to deliver the highest discharge
capacity of 342 mA h/g at the 2nd cycle with a capacity retention
of 71% at the end of the 50th cycle, whereas the compound LVO-WP delivered
a comparatively low discharge capacity of 206 mA h/g at the 2nd cycle
and showed a capacity retention of 82% at the end of the 50th cycle.

The second cycle charge–discharge curves for
0.01, 0.05,
and 0.1 M level doped LiV3O8 compounds are shown
in Figure 9a–c.
The second cycle discharge capacity values are given in Table 3. For the doped compounds, irrespective
of the dopants, a high capacity was observed in the case of 0.01 M
level of doping. This was in accordance with the CV plots, showing
broader peaks for 0.01 M level of doping, as discussed above. The
highest discharge capacity of 398 mA h/g was observed in the case
of the LiFe0.01V2.99O8 compound at
the end of the second cycle, which was the highest discharge capacity
among all compounds. When compared to LVO-P, a close value of the
second cycle discharge capacity was observed for the compounds LiV2.99Zn0.01O8, and LiV2.99Nb0.01O8. Among doped compounds, very low second cycle
discharge capacity was observed for compounds LiV2.95Co0.05O8 and LiV2.9Co0.1O8.

compounds.

Cycling Stability of Doped Compounds
As seen in Figure 10a–h, better
cycling stability was observed for LiV3–xMxO8 (M = Zn, Co, Fe,
Sn, Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo) compounds with x = 0.05 M
level of doping. Only in the case of zirconium, 0.01 M level of doping
was found to be better than 0.05 and 0.1 M doped compounds, in terms
of cycling stability. Among the zirconium-doped compounds, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 delivers a discharge capacity
of 250 and 247 mA h/g at the end of the 2nd and 50th cycles, respectively,
with an excellent capacity retention of 98%, whereas further doping
of zirconium degraded the electrochemical performance. Ren et al.9 reported on LiV3–xZrxO8 (x = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08) prepared by the citrate sol–gel
method, and concluded the x = 0.06 M level of doping
to be the best. They reported a discharge capacity of 269 and 246
mA h/g at the end of the 2nd and 50th cycles, respectively, for 0.1
C rate at the voltage window of 1.8–4.0 V. This indicates a
stability of 92%. The present work shows the best capacity and stability
for 0.1 C rate at the 0.01 M level of doping and is degraded for higher
level of doping. This indicates that the preparation method chosen
plays a key role in determining the optimized doping level to get
the best electrochemical performance of the cells. Among the tin-doped
compounds, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8 delivers
a discharge capacity of 245 and 241 mA h/g at the end of the 2nd and
50th cycles, respectively, with an excellent capacity retention of
98%. For LiV2.99Sn0.01O8, although
the cycling stability was only 86%, still it shows a better discharge
capacity of 251 mA h/g at the 50th cycle. However, the performance
was degraded in the case of high level of doping LiV2.9Sn0.1O8.. Therefore, the compounds,
LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, could be concluded as the best in
terms of capacity and stability among the doped compounds. The comparative
cycling stabilities of the compounds LiV2.99Zr0.01O8, LiV2.95Sn0.05O8,
LVO-P, and LiV2.99 Fe0.01O8 are shown
in Figure 11. Song
et al.,39 reported on the 0.15 M of molybdenum-doped
LiV3O8 nanosheets with a surface area of 24.8
m2/g to deliver a capacity of 217 and 206 mA h/g at the
initial and 100th cycle, respectively, for a current density of 300
mA/g. The electrical conductivities of the bare and 0.15 M of molybdenum-doped
LiV3O8 nanosheets were reported to be 3.52 ×
10–6 and 2.89 × 10–5 S/cm,
respectively. Nevertheless in our case, molybdenum doping was not
found to improve the performance of LiV3O8,
at any of the doping level.

Overall, as discussed
under electrical studies, though the electrical
conductivity of doped compounds were in the same order as that of
LVO-P, the percentage of ionic and electronic conductivity values
observed from transference number studies highly affected the electrochemical
performance. The higher the percentage of ionic conductivity, the
higher was the discharge capacity, as in the case of compound LiV2.99Fe0.01O8. However, its lower percentage
of electronic conductivity resulted in a poor cycling stability. The
compounds, LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8, with a good mixed conduction
nature showed good cycling stability, as discussed above.

Conclusions
LiV3O8 was prepared via
the most simple and
cost-effective reflux method. The presence of polymer P123 in the
preparation was found to affect the percentage of ionic and electronic
conduction, which in turn influences the capacity and cycling stability
of the cells, respectively. The effect of different levels of doping
with different elements on the structure, electrical, and electrochemical
performance of the compound was investigated. Among all doped compounds,
LiV2.99Zr0.01O8 and LiV2.95Sn0.05O8 was found to deliver the best electrochemical
performance both in terms of higher discharge capacity (∼250
mA h/g) and cycling stability (∼98%). The above compounds exhibited
a mixed conducting nature with ∼60% of ionic and ∼40%
of electronic conductivity. Though the compound LiV2.99Fe0.01O8 was found to exhibit the best discharge
capacity of 398 mA h/g for a current density of 30 mA/g because of
its high percentage of ionic conductivity of ∼83%, its cycling
stability was found to be degraded because of its poor percentage
of electronic conductivity of ∼17%. We conclude that, the type
and level of doping will successfully enhance the electrochemical
properties of the parent compound only when it exhibits a mixed conducting
nature.

Experimental Section
Pristine and doped lithium trivanadate
compounds were prepared
by the Pluronic P123-assisted reflux method. LVO-P: Initially 6 mM
polymer (Pluronic P123, Aldrich) was dissolved in 100 mL of distilled
water, and a homogenous viscous solution was obtained. To this, 0.1
M lithium acetate and 0.3 M ammonium metavanadate were added and refluxed
for 2 h in a constant temperature oil bath at a temperature of 120
°C. The resultant solution was evaporated on a hot plate, and
the dry residue was collected. The fine powder was then calcinated
at 550 °C for about 10 h in air at a heating rate of 3 °C/min.
A similar procedure was followed for all doped compounds. The raw
materials for different doped LiV3–xMxO8 (M = Zn, Co, Fe, Sn,
Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo) compounds were zinc acetate, cobalt acetate, iron
citrate, tin chloride, titanium oxysulfate, zirconyl nitrate, niobium
pentoxide, and molybdenum oxide, respectively. Doping was made at
three different levels of x = 0.01/0.05/0.1 M. LVO-WP:
For comparison, LiV3O8 was also prepared by
refluxing the required amount of lithium acetate and ammonium metavanadate
in the absence of the polymer P123, and the fine powder was calcinated
in the same way as done for LVO-P.

Material Characterization
The structure
of the pristine
and doped compounds were examined by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker
D8) equipped with Cu Kα-radiation, and the lattice parameter
values were obtained by TOPAS software version 4.2. The morphology
of the compounds was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (JEOL
JSM-6700F). Raman spectrometer (model LabRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA
Scientific) with a wavelength of 514 nm, and a power of 100 mW was
used for the Raman studies.

For electrical studies, pellets
with a diameter of 1 cm at a pressure of ten tons were made using
hydraulic pellet press, and the pressed pellets were sandwiched between
aluminum blocking electrodes and subjected to electrical studies.
The ac impedance study was performed using a computer controlled CH
Instrument (CHI-600E) with a fixed amplitude voltage of 10 mV. Four-probe
measurements made by SES Instruments (India) Pvt. Ltd were used to
find the dc conductivity. The percentages of ionic and electronic
conductivities of the compounds were found by transference number
measurements carried out using a Keithley 4001 source meter.

For electrochemical testing, slurries were prepared by mixing the
as-prepared active material (LVO), Super P carbon black, and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (Kynar 2801) binder (70:15:15 in wt %) dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidone under stirring for 24 h. The electrodes
were made by coating the slurry onto the Al foil. The composite electrodes
were kept in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 70 °C. The CR2016 coin-type
cells were assembled with the above cathodes, lithium metal as the
anode (Kyokuto Metal Co., Japan), and Celgard 2502 film as the separator.
A solution of 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and dimethyl
carbonate (1:1, v/v) (Merck) was used as the electrolyte. The coin
cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox at an O2 and
H2O level of less than 1 ppm. The cyclic voltammogram was
made in the voltage range of 2–4 V (at a scan rate of 0.058
mV/S) using a MacPile II (BioLogic, France) system. Galvanostatic
cycling was carried out at room temperature (25 °C) in the voltage
range of 2–4 V at a current rate of 0.1 C by using Bitrode
multiple battery testers (model SCN, Bitrode, USA).
