J-aggregates
of anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin
form at intermediate pH (2.3–3.1) in the presence of NiSO4 or ZnSO4 (ionic strength, I.S. = 3.2 M). These
aggregates convert to monomeric porphyrin units via metallation with
copper(II) ions. The kinetics for the disassembly process, as monitored
by UV/vis spectroscopy, exhibits zeroth-order behavior. The observed
zeroth-order rate constants show a two-term dependence on copper(II)
ion concentrations: linear and second order. Also observed is an inverse
dependence on hydrogen ion concentration. Activation parameters have
been determined for the disassembly process leading to ΔH≠ = (+163 ± 15) kJ·mol–1 and ΔS≠ =
(+136 ± 11) J·K–1. A mechanism is proposed
in which copper(II) cation is in pre-equilibrium with a reactive site
at the rim of the J-aggregate. An intermediate copper species is thus
formed that eventually leads to the final metallated porphyrin either
through an assisted attack of a second metal ion or through a direct
insertion of the metal cation into the macrocycle core.

Introduction
Kinetics and mechanisms for metal ion coordination and the removal
from a number of porphyrins in aqueous and nonaqueous media have been
extensively investigated.1 The reactivity
in a variety of confined microenvironments, such as micelles2 and microemulsions,3 or even nucleic acids or proteins4 has
been explored. On the contrary, the reactivity of porphyrin homoaggregates
with metal ions has been the subject of very few studies.

Many
water-soluble porphyrins have been shown to aggregate under appropriate
conditions of concentration, pH, and ionic strength.5−10 The study of
such species is facilitated by the impact of aggregation on their
basic physical–chemical properties. For example, porphyrin
electronic absorption is affected by aggregation leading to blue-shifted
or red-shifted bands depending on whether the chromophores interact
in a face-to-face (H-dimers) or in a side-by-side geometry (J-dimer),
respectively.11−14 Extended J-aggregates of porphyrins are
of particular interest because of their intriguing optical and electronic
properties, such as line narrowing of the absorption bands, resonance
light scattering (RLS), enhanced Raman scattering, nonlinear optical
effects, and photoconductivity.15−22 Water soluble anionic meso-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin
(TPPS4) in its diacid form is able to self-assemble through
an extensive network of hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic
interactions23−26 (Scheme 1). Depending on experimental conditions and protocol
of preparation, these J-aggregates exhibit a variety of different
morphologies such as nanoribbons, nanosheets, and hollow nanotubes
or fractal structures.24,26−30 The kinetics of growth of these supramolecular systems
depends on the concentration of the porphyrin and medium properties
such as pH, ionic strength, the presence of some cationic species,
and temperature.7,25,31−36 Their kinetics of formation has been described using models that
begin with a nucleation step followed by autocatalytic growth of the
assembly.13,37 Despite many reports dealing with the kinetics
of assembly formation, relatively few studies have focused on the
disassembly process.38−44 Quite recently, we have
shown that J-aggregates of TPPS4 can be restored to the
monomeric form through coordination of copper(II) ions into the porphyrin.
The insertion of this metal ion into the porphyrin core leads to disruption
of the nanoassemblies because it prevents any of the possible stabilizing
interactions between adjacent porphyrins.

These Basic Structures Fold and Roll Up
Reactions of metal
ions with porphyrins have been investigated largely under pseudo-first-order
conditions (i.e., a large excess of metal ions with respect to porphyrin),
and the derived rate laws are in most cases first order both in porphyrin
and in metal ion concentration. Furthermore, the rate law may contain
a term or terms depending on the specific counteranion and proton
concentration.40 As previously shown, TPPS4 J-aggregates react with copper(II) in a manner strongly dependent
on the details of the mixing protocol of the reagents. The combined
experimental evidence supports an attack by the metal ion at the external
rims of the supramolecular assemblies.40 Because of the importance of disaggregation to various applications,
we decided to extend our earlier study on the factors affecting the
rate of this process. To permit as a wide range of conditions as possible,
we chose to work under relatively mild acid conditions (pH 2.3–3.1)
and to promote aggregation through the addition of metal salts (ionic
strength, I.S. = 3.2 M). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first detailed study on the mechanism of metal ion insertion into
an already highly aggregated porphyrin system.

Results and Discussion
The formation of J-aggregates
from the porphyrin diacid (H4TPPS4) can be triggered
by using low pH conditions7,23 or, at intermediate
pH, by providing a high ionic strength environment.24,30,32 In a micromolar concentration range at pH
values between 2.3 and 3.1, the TPPS4 porphyrin is in its
non-J-aggregated diacid form (pKa = 4.9).
An increase in the ionic strength of the aqueous solution leads to
the formation of J-aggregates arising from the screening of the electrostatic
repulsions between interacting porphyrin units. In our experiments,
Ni(II) or Zn(II) sulfate was used to provide the desired fixed ionic
strength (I.S. = 3.2 M). These two d-block metal ions were chosen
based on their similarity to copper(II) except for their limited reactivity
under acidic conditions to form the corresponding metalloporphyrin
complexes.45 Zinc(II) rapidly inserts into
the porphyrin, but the corresponding metal complex is labile in our
pH range, leading to rapid demetallation, or exchange with copper(II)
ions.46 Ni(II) is significantly less reactive
than either zinc(II) or copper(II).47 It
was chosen for the experiments reported in the main text; results
for the more labile zinc(II), which are used for comparison and follow
similar trends, are collected in Supporting Information. Figure 1A shows
the typical UV/vis absorption spectral changes for the formation of
J-aggregates in the presence of NiSO4. Upon mixing the
reagents, the formation of the nanoassemblies can be monitored by
the rapid appearance and increase in intensity of a band at 490 nm,
that is, the spectroscopic signature of J-aggregated TPPS4. The kinetic traces for this process follow a stretched exponential
behavior that is characteristic for the “porphyrin last”
mixing protocol described in previous investigations.7 When copper(II) sulfate is added to an equilibrated solution
of J-aggregates, the J-band at 490 nm decreases linearly with time,
that is, zero-order kinetics are observed (Figure 1B). When ZnSO4 is used as a supporting
electrolyte, a two-component B-band region grows in 412 and 405 nm
because of the formation of the final reaction product, CuTPPS4 (data not shown).40 These spectral
features have been identified as arising from the monomer/dimer equilibrium
of CuTPPS4 previously studied with very fast relaxation
methods.48 In the presence of NiSO4 as a supporting electrolyte, as is the case of the reported
spectra, the 3A2g → 3T1g (P) transition around 400 nm due to [Ni(H2O)6]2+ masks these spectral changes.49

Figure 1 (A) UV/vis spectral changes
for the formation of J-aggregates
of the porphyrin TPPS4, according to a porphyrin last mixing
protocol, spectra have been collected with a scanning time of 10 s
([TPPS4] = 3 μM, [H2SO4] =
0.05 M, I.S. = 3.2 M, T = 298 K). The inset shows
the corresponding kinetic profile at 490 nm. (B) UV/vis spectral changes
for the disassembly process of equilibrated TPPS4 J-aggregates
upon addition of CuSO4, spectra have been collected with
a scanning time of 10 s ([TPPS4] = 3 μM, [H2SO4] = 0.05 M, [CuSO4] = 0.3 M, I.S.= 3.2 M
(NiSO4), T = 298 K). The inset shows the
corresponding kinetic profile at 490 nm. The notch detectable at 486
nm is an experimental artifact because of the deuterium emission spectra
from the instrument lamp and an imperfect baseline correction.

To investigate the dependence of the rate for the
disassembly process on experimental parameters, we prepared samples
of J-aggregates (according to the above protocol) and induced their
deaggregation by adding CuSO4. From the slope of the zeroth-order
kinetic traces, we calculated the values for the rate constants, k0 (M·s–1). Their values
together with the corresponding estimated errors are collected in Tables SI1–SI3 for the various experiments.
Consistent with zero-order kinetics, the observed rate constants k0 do not exhibit any dependence on the initial
porphyrin concentration (Figure SI1). At
constant pH, the rate constants k0 shows
a nonlinear dependence on [Cu2+] (Figure 2 and Figure SI2). These data can be conveniently fitted by a second-order polynomial
function of the form: k0 = (7.96 ±
2.52) × 10–11 M·s–1 +
(1.29 ± 0.15) × 10–9 s–1 [Cu2+] + (2.96 ± 0.02) × 10–9 M–1·s–1 [Cu2+]2 (at pH = 2.56, R2 = 0.99939).
This behavior is different from that previously reported for this
system for [Cu2+] < 0.3 M,40 suggesting different reaction pathways leading to the final reaction
products in different regimes of metal ion concentration.

Figure 2 Plot of
the observed zeroth-order rate constant k0 vs [Cu2+] at constant pH ([TPPS4] = 3 μM,
[H2SO4] = 0.0016 M, I.S. = 3.2 M (NiSO4), T = 298 K).

At
fixed [Cu2+], the rate constant shows a linear dependence
on the inverse hydrogen ion concentration (Figure 3 and Figure SI3), giving a slope of (6.83 ± 0.15) × 10–12 M2·s–1. Such a dependence has
been observed previously for the reaction with copper(II) of the water-soluble
2,4-disulfonated deuteroporphyrin dimethyl ester in acidic and neutral
solutions.50 We note that the range of
pH accessible in the experiments is limited by the acid stability
of the J-aggregates at pH < 2.3.

Figure 3 Plot of the
observed zeroth-order rate constant k0 vs 1/[H+] ([TPPS4] =
3 μM, [Cu2+] = 0.4 M, I.S. = 3.2 M (NiSO4), T = 298 K).

The rate law for the disassembly
process is derived from the mechanism shown in Scheme 2 and is zero order because it is independent
on the aggregate or the porphyrin concentration  where the meaning of k0, k1, k2, and K is discussed below.

Scheme 2 Mechanism Proposed
for the Disassembly
Process of TPPS4 J-Aggregates by Copper(II) Metal Ions
The proposed mechanism
assumes the presence of a “reactive” terminal diacid
porphyrin (EH4) at the end of the rim of the nanoassembly
or nanotube, containing n porphyrin units (Agg’EH4) (see left side of Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Formation of the
Intermediate Species by Interaction of Cu2+ with Only One
of the Nitrogen Atoms of the Protonated Core of a Reactive TPPS4 Unit at the Rim of the J-Aggregates and Subsequent Insertion
of the Metal Ion and Release of the Final CuTPPS4 Metal
Complex and Solvent Molecules
The reactivity of porphyrins within the extended
assembly “interior porphyrins” is considered to be negligible
because the porphyrin core is completely hindered by the porphyrin–porphyrin
interactions stabilizing the network. Any involvement of these porphyrins
would lead to a fragmentation of the aggregates, with a time-dependent
formation of new reactive ends and acceleration of the rates. The
linear kinetic traces and RLS experiments have ruled out such a possibility.40 The “porphyrin end” is the preferred
site of attack for a copper(II) ion leading to the formation of an
intermediate species (Agg’H3ECu+), in
which the metal interacts with the porphyrin core with a concomitant
loss of a proton (equilibrium constant K). Because
the porphyrin reactive end is part of the aggregate, only one of the
two exposed nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin core is coordinating the
copper ion, acting as a monodentate ligand (Agg’H3ECu+, Scheme 3). As further support of this point, recall that in reactions
involving the metallation of monomeric porphyrins in aqueous solution,
a complex dependence of rate on the proton concentration is commonly
observed because of the two protonation equilibria involving the macrocycle
core. In the present case, the observation of a simple inverse dependence
suggests the loss of a single proton. In a successive step, the intermediate
species, still embedded in the porphyrin nanoassembly, can undergo
a metal ion insertion into the macrocycle core, with the formation
of the final square planar copper(II) porphyrin complex, CuP. The
release of proton ions in this mechanism is not expected to alter
the pH of the bulk solution, because of the much larger concentration
of H2SO4 (millimolar range) with respect to
the porphyrin (micromolar range). Two distinct reaction pathways are
proposed: (i) a metal assisted path via k2 and (ii) a direct insertion of copper(II) via k1. This latter type of mechanism is observed for many
porphyrins,51 but the participation of
a second metal ion (equal or different with respect to the inserted
one) has been reported for meso-tetra(pyridyl)porphyrins
with di- and trivalent metal ions in aqueous solution.52 In both cases, the aggregate, containing n–1 units, is eventually released (Agg) and a new
porphyrin reactive end will be available again until complete disruption
of the nanoassembly (right side of Scheme 3). The time independence of the “porphyrin
ends” concentration along the process (i.e., the concentration
of reactive porphyrin remains small and is continuously replenished
during the process) is in line with the observed zero-order kinetics, k0, and the overall rate law.

The very
small term A in the fit of the rate constants in Figure 2 (A = (7.96
± 2.52) × 10–11 M·s–1) can be ascribed to statistical errors or to a metal ion independent
pathway, in which a very slow dissociation of monomers from the nanoassemblies
is responsible for this small contribution. Indeed, under the same
experimental conditions, the reactivity of the free diacid porphyrin
toward copper(II) is at least an order of magnitude larger, with respect
to the porphyrin embedded in the aggregates (t1/2 ≈ 80 s vs t1/2 ≈
1500 s). Activation parameters for the disassembling process have
been determined from an Eyring plot giving ΔH≠ = (+163 ± 15) kJ·mol–1 and ΔS≠ = (+136 ±
11) J·K–1 (Figure 4 and Table SI4). The large positive value for the activation entropy may be due
to the release of the metal derivative CuP from the nanoassembly to
the solution and the loss of the water ligands coordinated to the
copper center in the intermediate species, when the metal enters the
porphyrin core (Scheme 3). For the sake of comparison, we determined the activation parameters
for the copper(II) insertion into the monomeric diacid TPPS4, obtaining ΔH≠ = (+143
± 6) kJ·mol–1 and again a large positive
ΔS≠ = (+194 ± 11) J·K–1 (see Figure SI5 and Table SI5). These values are in line with literature data on the same porphyrin,
even at different ionic strengths.46 When
comparing the activation parameters for the copper(II) insertion in
the free monomer and in the aggregate, the observed differences could
be related to how the nanoassembly structure induces changes in the
way the metal ion approaches the available face of the terminal porphyrin
unit. Also, the sulfonate group of the porphyrin preceding the exposed
terminal end could be responsible for a change in the interaction
of the reactive end with the copper ion.

constants for the disassembling process of J-aggregated TPPS4 as induced by copper(II) ions ([TPPS4] = 3 μM,
[H2SO4] = 0.0016 M, [Cu2+] = 0.4
M, I.S. = 3.2 M (NiSO4)).

Conclusions
Given the large and burgeoning interest in J-aggregates
for many potential applications, such as optoelectronic devices,18 optical waveguide,53 or nonlinear optics,22 a precise understanding
of the factors governing their stability and controlling their sizes
is very important. Moreover, a detailed knowledge of the kinetics
of their disassembly allows controlling the release of porphyrins
in a time-dependent way. This mechanism can be conveniently triggered
by external stimuli, such as pH or metal ion concentration changes,
making these aggregates as nanoreservoirs of porphyrin units, exploitable,
for example, in photodynamic therapy or nanomedicine.54 Copper(II) has been chosen in the present study because
of its lability, the relative stability of its metal complexes under
acidic conditions and its limited redox behavior. However, other metal
ions could be used to trigger the assembly/disassembly process of
TPPS4 porphyrin, opening the way to a variety of potential
stimuli controlled applications.

Experimental
Section
The porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin
(TPPS4) as the tetrasodium salt was purchased from Frontier
Scientific. CuSO4·5H2O, NiSO4, ZnSO4, and sulfuric acid (ACS grade) were obtained from
Aldrich Co. and used as received. Milli-Q water was used for preparing
all solutions. A concentrated stock solution of TPPS4 was
freshly prepared, and the concentration of the stock solution was
calculated using ε412 = 5.33 × 105 M–1·cm–1 at the B-band
in neutral aqueous solution of low (∼0) ionic strength.

UV/vis extinction spectra were recorded on an Agilent 8453 diode
array and on a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer using 1 cm path length
quartz cells. Because of the nonmolecular nature of the system under
investigation, differences in the kinetic parameters are expected,
when different sets of experiments are compared. The strong dependence
of kinetics under initial conditions or even on the mixing protocol
has been already pointed out in our previous papers.7 In the present work, to obtain a better reproducibility
of the data, when investigating a particular effect (i.e., copper(II)
concentration or pH), a complete series of kinetic runs have been
performed using the same batch of preformed J-aggregate. To this purpose,
a large volume of solution of TPPS4 J-aggregate (10 mL)
was prepared using a porphyrin last protocol by adding a known volume
of concentrated TPPS4 solution (ca. 200 μM) to a
solution containing NiSO4 (or ZnSO4) and H2SO4 at the required concentration, and the solution
was equilibrated for at least an hour. Kinetic runs were initiated
in a plastic cell placed in the thermostated compartment of the instruments
by mixing equal volumes of a solution containing CuSO4,
NiSO4 (or ZnSO4), and H2SO4 at the required concentration and the solution containing the preformed
J-aggregate (in all the experiments I.S. = 3.2 M by addition of NiSO4 (or ZnSO4)).

The zero-order kinetics was
analyzed by a linear fit of the extinction data collected at 490 nm
after normalization to unity. The concentration of aggregated monomers
at any time has been obtained by subtracting the amount of diacid
or metallated porphyrin (determined using literature values of the
extinction coefficients) from the initial TPPS4 concentration,
obtaining zero-order kinetic constants (M·s–1) as slopes.
