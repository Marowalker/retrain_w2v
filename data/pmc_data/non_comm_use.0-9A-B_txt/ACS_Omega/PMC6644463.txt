Thin and ultraflat
conductive surfaces are of particular interest
to use as substrates for tip-enhanced spectroscopy applications. Tip-enhanced
spectroscopy exploits the excitation of a localized surface plasmon
resonance mode at the apex of a metallized atomic force microscope
tip, confining and enhancing the local electromagnetic field by several
orders of magnitude. This allows for nanoscale mapping of the surface
with high spatial resolution and surface sensitivity, as demonstrated
when coupled to local Raman measurements. In gap-mode tip-enhanced
spectroscopy, the specimen of interest is deposited onto a flat metallic
surface and probed by a metallic tip, allowing for further electromagnetic
confinement and subsequent enhancement. We investigate here a geometry
where a gold tip is used in conjunction with a silver nanoplate, thus
forming a heterometallic platform for local enhancement. When irradiated,
a plasmon-mediated reaction is triggered at the tip–substrate
junction due to the enhanced electric field and the transfer of hot
electrons from the tip to the nanoplate. This resulting nanoscale
reaction appears to be sufficient to ablate the thin silver plates
even under weak laser intensity. Such an approach may be further exploited
for patterning metallic nanostructures or photoinduced chemical reactions
at metal surfaces.

Introduction
Localized surface plasmon
modes are oscillations of conductive
electrons that can be observed in nanostructures when using a selected
set of wavelengths that match the plasmon resonances. These resonances
are primarily sensitive to the material and dimensions of the considered
conductive nanostructure, as well as the optical properties of the
impinging electromagnetic field, such as energy and polarization.
In isolated and sharp-cornered nanostructures, the excitation of plasmon
modes generally results in the confinement and enhancement of the
local electromagnetic field by several orders of magnitude and is
strongly dependent on the optogeometric experimental conditions. This
locally enhanced electromagnetic field is often exploited for improving
the sensitivity of vibrational spectroscopy measurements, such as
in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)1−3 and surface-enhanced
infrared absorption.4−6

Similar to SERS, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(TERS) exploits
such localized surface plasmon resonance confined at the apex of a
sharp metallic atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. This confined electromagnetic
field is enhanced up to several orders of magnitude and enables significant
intensity increase of local optical processes, such as Raman scattering.
TERS offers both an enhanced signal and spatial resolution beyond
the diffraction limit of light, as well as an improved Raman surface
sensitivity that can be exploited to probe in situ a variety of surface
reactions and understand fundamental electron-transfer processes.7

Further signal enhancement is achieved
when the analyte is placed
on a metallic substrate, thus forming a nanoscale metallic junction.
This mode is referred to as gap-mode TERS and has been used to probe
a variety of molecular systems, such as small molecules,8−12 nanostructured materials, and biomaterials.13−21 Ideal metallic substrates for gap-mode TERS in the backscattering
configuration are both atomically flat, reducing parasitic scattering
processes, and thin enough to be optically transparent.9,19,22,23 For this purpose, previous studies have focused on the use of gold
nanoplates as substrates, as gold nanoplates exhibit these attributes
and are chemically stable.9,12,17−19,21,22 Moreover, the use of silver nanoplates together with silver tips
has also been marginally reported, presumably due to the poor chemical
stability of silver.15,16

Importantly, the plasmon
resonance of the coated metallic tip can
also be exploited to drive chemical reactions at the nanoscale. Plasmons
may decay radiatively, by emission of a photon, or nonradiatively,
through the production of a highly energetic “hot” electron.24,25 Plasmon-mediated reactions are those that are triggered by the combination
of the locally enhanced electric field and the presence of hot electrons
that are the result of a plasmon resonance. The simultaneous initiation
and tracking of these plasmon-mediated reactions is possible through
the use of spectroscopic methods, such as SERS and TERS.

The
dimerization of 4-aminothiophenol or 4-nitrothiophenol to dimercaptoazobenzene
is an example of a well-investigated plasmon-mediated reaction by
SERS.26−30 Other plasmon-mediated reactions investigated include polymerization,31−34 demethylation of methylene blue,35 and
water splitting,36−38 among others. Hot-electron processes have also been
investigated for the reduction of aqueous silver and platinum ions.39,40 Although SERS is effective for monitoring plasmon-mediated reactions,
it lacks the spatial resolution to observe and control the reaction
at the nanometer level. In TERS, since the position of the tip is
precisely controlled with subnanometer resolution, the application
of TERS to plasmon-mediated reactions allows for spatially resolved
surface reactions and characterization of localized reactions.9,12,31,41,42

In this work, we perform a plasmon-mediated
reaction in a gap-mode
configuration, with a heterometallic junction formed by a gold tip
and a silver nanoplate. It is shown that as a result of the plasmon-mediated
reaction, the silver nanoplate is locally ablated, as a series of
holes appear on the metal surface. Herein, we investigated the possible
origin of such plasmon-mediated damage in metallic nanoplates using
weak irradiance conditions.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Ag
Nanoplates
For gap-mode TERS
experiments using an inverted optical microscope, the metallic nanoplate
should exhibit a high width/thickness aspect ratio with minimal surface
roughness. Large lateral dimensions of the nanoplates, on the order
of several microns, facilitate their observation under an optical
microscope, while being thin enough for the laser to penetrate through
the nanoplate and reach the metal tip. Protocols for the synthesis
of gold nanoplates that meet these requirements have been well established.43,44 Conversely, the synthetic approaches for preparing silver nanoplates
often yield smaller nanoplates with side lengths less than 500 nm,
making them less ideal for gap-mode TERS applications. In this study,
silver nanoplates were synthesized based on the seed-mediated method
developed by Zhang et al.45 As can be seen
in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Figure 1a, the resulting nanoplates
of the seed-mediated synthesis are large, with a distribution in size
ranging between 2 and 6 μm in side length. The prepared silver
nanoplates were commonly found to be triangular or truncated triangles,
as shown in Figure 1a. To determine the thickness of the nanoplates, atomic force microscopy
(AFM) scans were performed. The inset of Figure 1a shows a representative AFM image of a silver
nanoplate with the corresponding cross section in Figure 1b. Here, the thickness of the
nanoplates was found to vary from 40 to 60 nm and the surface exhibits
an RMS roughness on the order of several nanometers compared to about
500 pm for gold nanoplates.9 The absorbance
spectrum of the silver nanoplates was measured and can be seen in Figure S1. It shows an absorption of 1.3 at 632.8
nm for an approximately 35–40 nm thick plate. The as-prepared
nanoplates often stack (Figure 1a) or have smaller nanostructures, such as multifaceted nanoparticles,
on their surfaces, but clean, isolated silver plates can be found
and used for the TERS experiments.

inset of (a).

Tip-Enhanced Plasmon Drilling
of Ag Nanoplates
Prior
to performing tip-enhanced measurements, the surface of the nanoplate
was functionalized with a monolayer of 4-mercaptophenyl boronic acid
(4-MPBA). Figure 2a
shows an AFM scan of a functionalized nanoplate with an intrinsically
rough surface, but without other particles or plates present. The
nanoplates as synthesized provide SERS activity, as shown in Figure 2b, where the SERS
spectrum has been multiplied by 10. This is likely due to the rough
surface of the nanoplates, as the nanoscale roughness can support
hot spots. As a linearly polarized laser was used in an axial geometry,
the tip was localized slightly off-center of the focused laser beam
to benefit from the z-component of the tightly focused
beam. To collect the TERS measurements, the tip was approached to
the center of the triangular nanoplate to minimize any effects from
the edges of the nanoplates. Due to the thickness of the nanoplates,
a laser intensity of 1 mW was used, as lower laser power (i.e., 100
μW) did not allow for collection of a TERS signal. Considering
the thickness of the nanoplate (i.e., ∼40 nm), the effective
power is ∼33 μW at the sample, which is focused by the
100×, 0.9 numerical aperture (NA) objective. To differentiate
the TERS and SERS contributions, a collection of spectra was obtained
at increasing tip–sample distances, from 0 nm (tip engaged)
to 500 nm with varying step sizes, and the results are shown in Figure 2b. The difference
between TERS and SERS measurements can be observed in Figure S2, where the difference in intensity
ratios is highlighted by comparing the SERS spectrum multiplied by
10 to a typical TERS spectrum. When the tip is at the surface of the
nanoplate, the electromagnetic enhancement offered by the tip is able
to locally enhance the Raman spectrum of the 4-MPBA molecules adsorbed
on the Ag nanoplate. As the tip is retracted from the surface, the
signal decays, but not completely. Instead, the signal from a tip
retracted 500 nm above the nanoplate surface is more intense than
the reference SERS spectrum collected on flat nanoplates without any
TERS tip. To ascertain the origin of this increase in signal, a post-TERS
AFM scan was performed (Figure 2c). The scan clearly shows that the center of the nanoplate
has been “drilled”, with considerable additional roughness
having been introduced around the ablated area. This deformation has
amplified the SERS effect through an increase of the localized roughness,
as shown in the AFM topography (Figure 2c). To determine if this effect is facilitated by the
presence of an adsorbed molecule, the same process was repeated on
a bare nanoplate (Figure 3a). Once again, after the tip-enhanced measurements were performed,
deformation of the nanoplate was observed and, as shown in Figure 3b, is sufficiently
large to be seen optically under a microscope.

nanoplate. (b) TERS spectra obtained upon
increasing the tip–sample distance, as indicated, compared

silver nanoplate,

with the arrow indicating the same point.

To further investigate the cause of this localized destruction,
a TERS experiment was performed under optical misalignment, where
the tip was placed on the edge of the focused laser focal plane. Under
such a configuration, little to no electromagnetic enhancement at
the tip apex should be present. As depicted in Figure 4a,b, selected points for spectral collection
were chosen on and off the nanoplate. Under the misaligned conditions,
no TERS spectra of the adsorbed molecule could be collected (Figure 4c). However, there
are some silicon and 4-MPBA contributions, as shown in Figure 4c, since the tip is still in
the vicinity of the focal point and 4-MPBA is present at the surface
of the glass due to the functionalization procedure. As the irradiation
time for this experiment was significantly shorter (by more than a
minute) than that used in Figure 2, the sample was exposed to the laser for an additional
5 min to determine if the nanoplate had been damaged by laser-induced
heating. The postirradiation AFM scan (Figure 4d) did not exhibit any damage. To verify
that the nanoplate was not impervious to drilling, the tip and laser
were realigned to be in an ideal TERS configuration. Spectra were
collected on and off the nanoplate in aligned conditions (red and
blue dots, Figure 4a). When the tip is away from the nanoplate, spectral features of
4-MPBA and the silicon second-order phonon mode from the tip can be
observed. The 4-MPBA contribution is presumably coming from the presence
of 4-MPBA at the surface of glass, as previously mentioned, whereas
the silicon peak is coming from the AFM tip. Importantly, Figure 4e highlights that
the system is well aligned, as shown by the intense contribution of
4-MPBA over the nanoplate compared to the contamination seen in the
spectrum collected off the nanoplate. Ten further spectra were collected
in the center of the nanoplate at various tip–sample distances
(Figure S3). Additional single-point measurements
were collected at other positions on the nanoplate (Figure 4b). After collection of the
TERS spectra in the selected areas, a subsequent AFM scan was acquired
(Figure 4f). Once again,
local damage was observed in the exact position where the spectra
were collected. The defects exhibit two critical structural components.
In the region that was irradiated over a longer period (barycenter
of the triangle), the degree of damage is considerably greater than
that of the areas where single TERS measurements were performed. Furthermore,
regardless of the exposure time, the defects adapt a triangular shape,
similar to that of the AFM tip. As the positions and relative sizes
of the holes can be readily changed based on the TERS experiments,
this approach could be used to pattern nanostructures through localized
metal ablation.

at which
spectra were collected on (red) and off (blue) the nanoplate and (b)
other points of collection. (c) No TERS signal is measured off alignment,
resulting in (d) no damage to the nanoplate. (e) TERS image measured
on the nanoplate (red), resulting in (f) damage to the nanoplate.

Time-lapse series of experiments
were conducted to monitor the
4-MPBA Raman spectra changes over irradiation time (Figure S4). Notable spectral changes, such as weaker intensity
and spectral profile changes, are observed for spectra collected after
longer irradiation time, highlighting the onset of the structural
damages to the Ag plate.

Overall, these observations indicate
that under an ideal TERS configuration,
the TERS tip can induce significant damage on a metallic surface,
and can be used to drill triangular holes into the nanoplates. As
metallic nanoplates are commonly used in gap-mode TERS measurements,
the source of this nanoscale surface ablation was further investigated.
Possible causes of this drilling are multiple and can presumably be
assigned to (i) mechanical damage from the tip; (ii) plasmonic heating;
(iii) a plasmon-mediated chemical or electrochemical reaction; or
(iv) a combination of these processes. As mentioned earlier, no hole
generation was observed when the laser was not focused on the tip.
Since pseudo-TERS measurements were performed (single point and tip
retraction), it is unlikely that mechanical damage is the cause, despite
that triangular shape matching that of the metallized AFM tips. Furthermore,
under prolonged irradiation with this configuration, no damage was
observed. This means that laser heating from a far-field focused beam
alone is insufficient to drive this process and that the presence
of the tip at the focal point of the laser is necessary to induce
local damage. The excitation source was set at 632.8 nm, and since
the plasmon excitation is quite weak at this wavelength, this may
exclude thermal effects in these experimental conditions. This does
not preclude the possibility of heating due to the plasmonic resonance
of the tip. As such, we focus here on the effect of an ideal TERS
configuration, where the metallized tip is aligned with the laser.

Heat Generation at the TERS Tip
Optical confinement
of the electric field in small volumes of metal nanoparticles results
in plasmonic heating.46 This heating has
been exploited, among other uses, for cancer phototherapy.47,48 Plasmonic heating can be sufficient to vaporize the surrounding
medium,49,50 or under intense continuous wave sources,51 or pulsed lasers,52 locally melt the nanoparticle. Previous studies have shown plasmonic
heating to adversely affect the SERS spectra, as molecules are desorbed
or nanoparticles are damaged.53,54 To investigate the
heating of the tip, finite-element method (FEM) calculations were
performed to evaluate the temperature gradient in the vicinity of
the tip–nanoplate assembly. The geometry and the material properties
were set to match the experiment, with the laser linearly polarized
and propagating along the tip axis. The power of the laser source
was 1 mW before the nanoplate. The normalized electric field was calculated
for a tip–sample separation of 2 nm, as shown in Figure 5a. The corresponding temperature
change is reported in Figure 5b. For a tightly focused Gaussian beam, there is a component
of the electric field along the tip axis; however, it is difficult
to ascertain the exact value of this component. To determine the maximum
electric field, and thus the maximum heating expected, the case where
the laser is polarized along the tip axis with a side illumination
geometry is also calculated (Figure S5).

Figure 5 (a) Electric
field in the plane of polarization with 2 nm separation
from the silver nanoplate. (b) Resultant temperature increase.

This result for the electric field
calculation (Figure 5a) is consistent with previous
results.23,55 The resultant weak temperature increase,
limited to about 2 K, as shown in Figure 5b, is comparable to the work of Balois et
al., who predicted an increase of several degrees under 50 μW
planewave side illumination with a gold tip–gold substrate
junction.55 Downes et al. predicted a much
larger temperature increase, up to ΔT = 360
K, in the gold tip–silver substrate junction at 533 nm using
side illumination;56 in comparison, the
reciprocal metal configuration (Ag tip and Au substrate) illuminated
at 633 nm increases by only 30 K under the same irradiation conditions
of 1 mW/μm2.57 Differences
between these results and ours can be attributed to distinct excitation
wavelengths and geometry. In the backscattering configuration that
we have used for our experiment and modeling, it is likely that the
metal substrate has decreased the laser intensity reaching the tip,
leading to limited heating at the tip apex, as observed in Figure 5b. As shown in Figure S5, polarization along the tip axis yields
a higher temperature increase of ΔT ∼
25 K, but to reiterate, the difference between our study and that
of Downes et al. is their illumination with 532 nm compared to our
excitation with 632.8 nm, as both calculations were conducted with
irradiation of 1 mW/μm2. The FEM simulations show
that the calculated temperatures at the tip–substrate junction
are insufficient to cause drastic damage to the nanoplates.

Plasmon-Mediated
Reactions at a TERS Tip
To further
investigate the role of the tip in the nanoplate drilling, the TERS
tip was investigated by SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy.
SEM images were first obtained for a pristine TERS tip (Figure 6a,b). A tip coated at the same
time as the pristine tip was used for the TERS experiment. The tip
selected for EDX measurements was minimally used. In this instance,
the laser was focused on the nanoplate. When the tip was raster-scanned
over the nanoplate during the laser-tip alignment, the tip drilled
a hole near the middle of the nanoplate (Figure S6). As this tip was not in the focal spot of the laser for
only a few seconds, and was in motion during this time, plasmon-induced
heating was minimized.

tip and
(c) a TERS tip after silver nanoplate drilling, with (d) areas at
which EDX spectra were collected. (e, f) The corresponding EDX spectra.

Figure 6c,d shows
the damage to the tip after the TERS experiment. As seen in Figure 6d, the gold layer
is delaminated from the tip, revealing the silicon that constitutes
the bulk of the tip. There are two distinct sections chosen for EDX
measurement, just below and above the tip apex, as highlighted in Figure 6d. In the area above
the tip apex, EDX measurements show the expected gold and silicon
(Figure 6e): this section
is the gold layer, ripped away from the tip during alignment. On the
lower section, contributions from silver are also seen (Figure 6f). A small contribution from
aluminum is observed (Figure 6f), but belongs to the background noise, since no contrast
could be seen in the aluminum EDX map.

Maps showing the distribution
of each element of interest were
also acquired, correlating to the SEM image of the damaged tip (Figure 7a). The gold map,
in Figure 7b, shows
gold in all undamaged areas of the tip, but not the exposed silicon
or the area below the tip apex. Conversely, the silicon map shows
the highest signal in the area exposed (Figure 7c) and also present under the undamaged layer
of gold, but no signal is seen in the area below the tip apex. The
map of silver shows only a presence in the area below the tip apex
(Figure 7d). Gold and
silicon are also likely present under the tip apex, but are shielded
by the silver structure.

drilling. EDX maps
of (b) gold, (c) silicon, and (d) silver.

The presence of amorphous silver on the TERS tip suggests
that
silver species are transferred from the nanoplate to the tip by a
plasmon-mediated reaction. Such reactions are triggered by the combination
of the locally enhanced electric field and the presence of hot electrons,
highly energetic electrons that are the result of nonradiative plasmon
decay. The generation of hot electrons has been described for both
silver and gold nanostructures. To further understand the relationship
between TERS and hot-electron generation, it is necessary to compare
our configuration to other gap-mode TERS experiments.

Typically,
gap-mode TERS experiments use gold nanoplates. For the
resulting tip–plate junctions (gold–gold, silver–gold),
to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have demonstrated
deformation of the nanoplate after TERS measurements to the degree
we have shown and under modest irradiation conditions. The use of
a silver nanoplate with a gold tip is likely the driving force behind
our two-dimensional (2D) patterning of a metallic surface. Here, we
summarize that two factors, either individually or in combination,
yield the changes to the structure of the nanoplate. It has been shown
that the citrate can be oxidized by hot holes; electrons released
from this oxidation can then reduce Ag+ ions.58 Under different conditions, Ag+ can
be reduced directly by hot electrons.40 The transfer of the hot electrons from the tip to the nanoplate
can be aided by the layer of atmospheric water at the tip–substrate
interface or from the direct contact between the tip and nanoplate
during measurement. As citrate is used in the synthesis of the nanoplates
described in this study, it is possible that even after functionalization
with 4-MPBA, some citrate remains on the surface. Citrate residues
have been observed in the TERS spectrum, at 1400 cm–1, as shown in Figure S7.59−61 It is known that coating a surface with a thin layer of SiO2 can prevent hot electrons from reaching or escaping the surface.62 However, in the case of coating the metal tip
with such a layer, we have previously shown that this diminishes the
EM enhancement and resulting TERS compatibility of the tip.23 As the use of silver nanoplates with gap-mode
TERS is limited,15,16 it is difficult to ascertain
if this effect occurs exclusively with silver nanoplates. In those
described works, a silver tip was used in conjunction with the silver
plates. However, we use a gold tip rather than a silver tip. As our
conditions use a heterometallic junction, the hot electron generated
by the gold tip could reduce surface silver species onto the tip,
potentially when the tip makes contact with the surface. The triangular
geometry of the resulting hole is related to the direction of the
hot electron coming off from the tetrahedral tip.

Conclusions
In summary, silver nanoplates were synthesized by the seed-mediated
method for use as substrates for gap-mode TERS experiments. During
both the alignment process and the collection of TERS spectra, nanoscale
holes with a triangular shape were ablated in the nanoplate when the
tip was aligned with the laser. Using FEM calculations, we investigated
the role of plasmon-induced heating and determined that the elevation
in temperature at the junction between the tip and nanoplate was not
enough to account for the surface damage. EDX measurements of a tip
used to generate the triangular nanoholes showed the presence of silver
on the tip, making the reduction of silver species from the nanoplate
onto the tip a likely cause of this nanoplate drilling. Further investigations
to determine the exact trigger of this process could provide greater
insight into plasmon-mediated chemical reactions, especially when
they can be controlled with nanoscale precision. Additionally, as
this study has shown, the nanoscale patterning of 2D materials can
expand beyond reactions involving the surface species but can be used
to prepare metal surfaces with 2D patterns. These patterned metasurfaces
would exhibit unique optical properties compared to the original nanoplate,
such as improved SERS compatibility.

Methods
Silver Nanoplate
Synthesis
A seed solution was prepared
by combining aqueous AgNO3 (0.1 mM, 25 mL), trisodium citrate
(30 mM, 0.3 mL), poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (MW ∼ 29 000
g/mol, 3.5 mM, 1.5 mL), and H2O2 (30 wt %, 60
μL) under stirring. An aqueous NaBH4 solution (100
M, 250 μL) was injected, and the solution was stirred for 30
min. The solution was centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 8 min,
and the nanoplates were redispersed in deionized water. This washing
step was repeated twice, and the seeds were then dispersed in 40 mL
of deionized water. In the seeded growth process, l-ascorbic
acid (0.1 M, 0.375 mL) and trisodium citrate (0.075 M, 0.125 mL) were
injected to 10 mL of the seed solution under stirring. A solution
of AgNO3 (1 mM, 20 mL), citric acid (0.1 M, 0.125 mL),
and sodium citrate (1.5 mM, 0.1 mL) was prepared. It was added to
the seed solution using a syringe pump at a rate of 0.2 mL/min. After
injection, 20 mL of the reaction solution was removed and the remaining
solution was used as seeds for the next growth cycle. In total, four
rounds of growth were performed. Nanoplates were drop-cast onto clean
coverslips.

Visible and Near-Infrared Absorption
Visible and near-infrared
absorption measurements were performed using a halogen lamp with a
100 μm optical fiber coupled to the inverted optical microscope.
A 10× (NA = 0.25) expanded the source beam and a 20× (NA
= 0.4) objective collimated the beam onto the sample, resulting in
a spot size of about 50 μm. The transmitted light was collected
by a 20× (NA = 0.5) objective prior to analysis by the spectrometer.
Analysis was performed in the 400–1000 nm range, with an acquisition
time of 1 s per spectrum over 50 accumulations.

Self-Assembled
Monolayer Preparation
The nanoplate
sample was functionalized with 4-mercaptophenyl boronic acid (4-MPBA).
4-MPBA was dissolved in hot ethanol to produce a 10–3 M solution. The nanoplate sample was immersed in the solution for
24 h. The sample was then rinsed with ethanol to remove any non-covalently-bonded
4-MPBA and dried under nitrogen.

TERS Tip Preparation
Commercial AFM tips (NCL-50, NanoWorld)
were prepared for TERS by electron-beam evaporation. An adhesion layer
of 5 nm of Ti was deposited, followed by 20 nm of Au. The deposition
rate was 0.3–0.5 Å/s.

TERS Setup
The
TERS setup combines a Raman spectrometer
(HR LabRam, HORIBA) connected to an inverted optical microscope (Olympus
IX71) with an AFM (NanoWizard II, JPK Instruments). Measurements were
performed in transmission mode such that light is focused from below
onto the metallized tip and the sample. A 100× objective (NA
= 0.9) (PlanAPO Olympus) focused the laser on the sample and collected
the Raman signal. The Raman signal is detected using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
charge-coupled device (HORIBA, Symphony), with the fundamental laser
light removed by a notch filter. A photodiode is connected to the
AFM control so that Rayleigh scattering from the TERS tip can be measured
to align the tip in the focal point of the objective.

Using
an excitation laser of 632.8 nm with an intensity of 1 mW before the
nanoplate, the Rayleigh scattering from the metallized tip was measured
by the photodiode. After aligning the tip at the center of the focal
point, the tip was frozen in the x- and y-positions. An AFM scan was obtained by sample scanning. All measurements
were performed in intermittent contact mode, with a setpoint of ca.
10–20 nm.

The TERS signal was collected at points with
a 600 grooves/mm grating
and a spectrometer slit width of 200 μm. Spectra were typically
recorded in the 700–1800 cm–1 range with
a 10 s acquisition time per spectrum. The corresponding SERS spectra
were collected under the same conditions, in the absence of the TERS
tip.

Finite-Element Modeling
COMSOL Multiphysics 5.2 was
employed for finite-element modeling of the electric field and resulting
temperature. The TERS tip was modeled as an inverted Si cone with
an angle of 22.5°, with a 30 nm diameter spherical tip and a
20 nm thick Au shell. The geometry is 2 μm wide and 600 nm tall.
In air, the tip is positioned above the silver nanoplate, which is
50 nm thick. The geometry is meshed tetrahedrally, with an element
size of 2–50 nm, a growth rate of 1.45, and a curvature factor
of 0.5. The material properties are summarized in Table S1. Where necessary, the relative permeability was set
as 1. Initially, there is no electric field and the temperature is
293.15 K. All boundaries are held at room temperature (293.15 K),
except the top of the tip, which is thermally insulated. Perfectly
matched layers (PMLs) of 200 nm are set at edges of the geometry to
absorb reflections. The PML was meshed using a swept mesh with eight
layers. A scattering boundary condition is applied along the top face
of the air boundary. The bottom of the geometry is illuminated by
a tightly focused Gaussian beam at 632.8 nm, 1 μm spot size,
and 1 mW of power before the nanoplate to match experimental values.
As the Gaussian beam was tightly focused, the longitudinal component
of the electric field was set as63  Using the Multiphysics
approach, the electric
field is calculated using the Wave Optics Module and is linked to
the heat transfer module.

Tip Characterization
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM)
images of TERS tips were obtained using a LEO Zeiss 1540XB (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) fitted with an Oxford Instruments X-ray system,
allowing for in situ EDX analyses and mapping.
