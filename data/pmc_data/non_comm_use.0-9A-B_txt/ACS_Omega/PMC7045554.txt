Parabens
are widely used as preservatives in food, pharmaceutical,
and cosmetic products. These compounds are known for their estrogen
agonist activity. This research investigates the synthesis of micro-
and mesoporous silica from coal fly ash at different pH values (13,
11, 9, and 7) as well as its use as an adsorbent for the removal of
parabens. The materials were characterized, and X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analysis revealed that the fly ash acid treatment reduced the
presence of aluminum, iron, and calcium oxides and also that silica
synthesized at lower pH values (7 and 9) showed a higher SiO2 content. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) analyses revealed microporous silica formation for silica synthesized
at pH 13 and mesoporous silica at pH 7, 9, and 11. Adsorption tests
were performed with materials, and FA-AT7 showed a higher adsorption
capacity. The effect of factors (A) adsorbent mass, (B) initial paraben
concentration, and (C) agitation rate on the adsorption process was
studied for the FA-AT7 adsorbent using a factorial experimental design.
Standardized Pareto charts revealed a negative effect of factor A,
positive effect of factor B, and negative interaction effects of factors
A–B for all studied parabens. Isotherms and multicomponent
kinetic studies were performed. A linear type-III isotherm was obtained,
and adsorption equilibrium was reached at approximately 10 min.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Parabens, esters of 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid, which differ only in
the ester group and may be an alkyl or benzyl group, are the most
popular and widely used preservatives in food, pharmaceutical, and
cosmetic products due to their broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.1,2 However, recent studies have shown that parabens possess estrogen
agonist activity, being is even detected in human breast tumor tissue
with an average concentration of 20 ng g–1 of tissue.1−3 The widespread use of these compounds has led to environmental contamination.2 Parabens were detected in surface waters, soils
and sediments, and indoor biota.1,4 These compounds can
be released into the aqueous environment mainly through wastewater
treatment discharges and also as runoff from nonpoint sources and
deposition of particles from the atmosphere.4 Most parabens are frequently found in river water at concentrations
varying from nanograms per liter to micrograms per liter, and their
levels depend mainly on the extent of water dilution resulting from
rainfall.5

Paraben adsorption using
adsorbent materials has been studied for
the removal of parabens from environmental samples.6,7 In
this context, mesoporous silica from coal ash, as low-cost adsorbents,
can be an effective alternative for the removal of parabens from aqueous
media. In addition, this strategy can contribute to the reduction
of the disposal of solid industrial waste from coal-based thermoelectric
plants, such as coal ash, by transforming it into value-added products.
It is estimated that around 750 million tons of coal fly ash are generated
each year globally; however, the utilization rate of it is only up
to 25%, especially in the production of cement and concrete, manufacture
of ceramic materials, and for use as catalysts and adsorbents.8,9 Thus, it is important to study alternative uses of these wastes,
as they are also a source of environmental pollution, generating large
amounts of volatile organic pollutants.8−11

In this context, the mesoporous
silicates and aluminosilicates
known as M41S,12,13 in particular their main components
MCM-41 (hexagonal phase), MCM-48 (cubic phase), and MCM-50 (lamellar
phase), are highlighted.13 These materials
have regular cylindrical pores with a controllable pore diameter (2–30
nm), high surface area, high chemical and thermal stability, and easy
silica functionalization. These properties show that these materials
present a high potential for applications in the areas of adsorption,
catalysis, chemical separations, and biotechnology devices.14

The main principle of mesoporous silica
synthesis is the use of
surfactants or other species as templates through a sol–gel
process.15 MCM-41 synthesis is generally
carried out in a basic or neutral medium using a silicon source and
a quaternary ammonium surfactant. A gel is formed and subjected to
a hydrothermal treatment, followed by the removal of the template
via either calcination or solvent extraction.13,15,16

Materials with different properties
can be obtained by altering
the synthesis conditions, such as the template/silica ratio; concentration
and hydrophobicity of the template; and temperature, pH, and the nature
of silica.16−18

This work investigates the synthesis of mesoporous
silica from
coal fly ash at different pH values (13, 11, 9, and 7) and its use
as an adsorbent for the removal of parabens from aqueous solution.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Reagents and Materials
Fly ash was
supplied by Eneva-Energia Pecém, located at São Gonçalo
do Amarante-Ceara, Brazil. The reagents HCl and NaOH and the surfactant
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were obtained from Vetec, Brazil.
For adsorption tests, individual high-purity standards (≥99%)
of methylparaben (MP), ethylparaben (EP), propylparaben (PP), and
butylparaben (BP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Their physical–chemical
structures and properties are summarized in Table 1. For chromatographic analysis, methanol
(PanReac AppliChem ITW Reagents, high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) grade) was used. Acetic acid used in the mobile phase was obtained
from Vetec, and NaCl, used in the determination of the point of zero
charge, was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

2.2 Fly Ash Acid Treatment
Prior to the
mesoporous material syntheses, fly ash was subjected to acid treatment
so that the amount of metallic impurities present in the raw material
could be reduced.22 This procedure consisted
of mixing 8.00 g of fly ash (200 mesh) with 200 mL of HCl (2.0 mol
L–1) in a reflux system at 90 °C for 2 h. Then,
the treated material was centrifuged and washed with deionized water
until the pH was between 5.0 and 6.0. Thereafter, the solid was dried
at 80 °C for 18 h. The samples were named FA and FA-AT for materials
before and after acid treatment, respectively.

2.3 Micro-
and Mesoporous Material Syntheses
Prior to the material synthesis,
silica was extracted from fly
ash. For this, in a typical procedure, 1.00 g of the acid-treated
fly ash was added to 6.5 mL of NaOH (4.0 mol L–1), in a reflux system, at 90 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then
centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min and filtered, and the supernatant
was used as the silica source.23,24 The synthesis procedures
were based on the works of Okada et al.25 and Santos et al.26 Herein, a reaction
mixture of silicon oxide/NaOH/CTABr/H2O with molar ratio
1.0:0.25:0.08:103.5 was used. First, 0.8917 g of CTABr was dissolved
in 20 mL of deionized water, under magnetic stirring at 350 rpm, Then,
an aliquot of 18.5 mL of silica source was added. Finally, 2 mol L–1 HCl was added slowly until a gel (at pH 7, 9, or
11) or clear (pH 13) solution was observed. The total volume of the
mixture was approximately 57.0 mL. By adding the silica source and
making up the volume to 57 mL, the pH of the solution was already
around 13, i.e., only pH adjustment to 11, 9, and 7 was required.

The pH effect over the syntheses was evaluated at pH values of 13,
11, 9, and 7, covering the basic to neutral pH range.15 In all of the procedures, the reaction mixtures were aged
under magnetic stirring (350 rpm) for 24 h and then without stirring
for 24 h more. After that, the reaction mixture was subjected to stirring
for 30 min, and then transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel
autoclave, and heated under autogenous pressure and static conditions
at 110 °C for 24 h.

The resulting materials were washed
three times with deionized
water, dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 560 °C
for 6 h, with a heating rate of 1 °C min–1.
After cooling, the samples were further ground and sieved through
200 mesh sieves. The materials obtained from this process were named
FA-AT13, FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7, for the samples synthesized
at pH values 13, 11, 9, and 7, respectively.

2.4 Material
Characterization
The chemical
composition of the materials before and after the acid treatment,
as well as the synthesized solids at different pH values, was determined
by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using a Rigaku spectrometer, model ZSX
Mini II, operating with a tube of Pd (40 kV, 1.2 mA). Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed in Panalytical model
X-Pert PRO equipment with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154056 nm) radiation
for the crystalline phase with a routine power of 1600 W (40 kV, 40
mA). The high-angle diffractograms were obtained in the 2θ range
from 5 to 50°, while at a low angle, the range was from 1.5 to
10° with a counting time of 762 s. The identification of crystalline
phases in the samples was performed using X-Pert HighScore software
(Panalytical).

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements
were performed using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrum spectrometer, with
a nominal resolution of 2 cm–1, in the region of
4000–400 cm–1. Samples were prepared in KBr
pellets (3% mass).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried
out in Quanta 450
FEG. The samples were prepared on double-sided carbon tape on an aluminum
support and coated with a thin layer of gold.

Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images were acquired with
a TEM-FEG (JEM 2100F) field-emission gun transmission electron microscope
(acceleration voltage 200 kV, spot size 1, alpha selector 3). The
samples were prepared by drying a drop of the isopropyl alcohol-dispersed
nanoparticles for 24 h at room temperature on a carbon-coated copper
grid (ultrathin carbon/holey carbon, 400 mesh copper grid, Ted Pella,
Inc.). The TEM images were acquired with the sample on a single-tilt
sample holder using a Gatan 831.J45M0 camera, Gatan Digital Micrograph,
and EMMENU programs at different resolutions.

The textural characterization
of the samples was performed by gas
adsorption. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained
at −196 °C over a wide range of relative pressure from
0.01 to 0.995 atm with a volumetric adsorption analyzer Autosorb iQ3 (Quantachrome Instruments). Prior to each measurement, the
samples were outgassed at 300 °C to a vacuum of 4 mmHg for 12
h. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method. The pore size distribution (PSD) was determined using
the density nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT). The total
pore volume was calculated from the adsorption isotherm at P/P0 = 0.992 for sample FA-AT13
and P/P0 = 0.985 for
materials FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7.

2.5 Paraben
Adsorption
2.5.1 Adsorbent and pH Selection
To identify
the most efficient synthesized material for further adsorption studies,
initial batch adsorption tests were performed.

A total of 150
mg of adsorbents was added to 40 mL of multicomponent paraben aqueous
solution at 10 mg L–1 concentration, at room temperature
(28 ± 2 °C), and at pH 5.0, adjusted using HCl, 1.0 mol
L–1. The system was kept under 300 rpm agitation
for 18 h, and after this, the solution was filtered using a 13 mm
syringe filter with 0.22 μm hydrophilic membrane Durapore (poly(vinylidene
difluoride), PVDF) (Millisul, Brazil). The adsorption capacity was
determined according to eq 1 1  where q is the adsorption
capacity in mg g–1; Ci and Ce are the initial and equilibrium
concentrations of parabens in solution, respectively; v is the solution volume in liters; and m is the
adsorbent mass in grams.

The material that showed better performance
in the initial adsorption
tests was selected for further adsorption experiments, but first,
the point of zero charge (pHPZC) was determined to select
the most appropriate pH for the subsequent tests. pHPZC was determined for the FA-AT7 material by the pH drift method.27−29 A mass of 0.05 g was placed in contact with 20 mL of NaCl solutions
(0.1 mol L–1), previously adjusted to the pH range
from 2 to 12 for which was used 1 mol L–1 HCl or
1 mol L–1 NaOH solution was used. The solutions
were stirred for 24 h at 200 rpm. After that, the pH of the final
solutions was monitored, and the results were plotted as ΔpH
versus pHi. The pHpzc was determined by taking
into account the point at which the ΔpH was equal to zero.

Considering the pHpzc of the material as well as pKa of parabens, pH values ranging from 3 to 7
were studied in the adsorption test in batch, which was performed
by adding 10 mg of adsorbent in 40 mL of multicomponent paraben solution
at 10 mg L–1 concentration under 300 rpm agitation
for 24 h. According to the results, the pH value was set to the experimental
design tests.

2.5.2 Experimental Design and
Adsorption Tests
The experimental screening design (STATGRAPHICS
Centurion, StatPoint
technologies, Inc., The Plains, VA) consisted of 16 + 2 (central points)
experimental trials was developed. To determine the factors that influence
the removal of parabens by the selected material and to investigate
the interaction effects of various parameters, three factors were
varied at two levels (23) (Table 2). The variables studied were initial concentration,
agitation, and adsorbent mass. The adsorption capacity was used as
a response variable. For this, adsorption experiments were performed
in batch using the FA-AT7 adsorbent at pH 3 for 24 h.

Table 2 Levels of the Studied Factors in the
Experimental Design
 	 	levels	
factors	symbols	–1	0	+1	
adsorbent mass (mg)	A	2	6	10	
initial concentration (mg L–1)	B	5	10	15	
agitation rate (rpm)	C	150	225	300	
Based on this study and considering
the concentration at which
the parabens are found in the aquatic environment, the values of the
parameters adsorbent mass, initial concentration of the analytes,
and agitation were fixed for the kinetics and equilibrium studies.

2.5.3 Kinetics and Equilibrium Studies
Adsorption
kinetics studies were carried out in a batch system using
a 40 mL multicomponent paraben solution (5 mg L–1), 2 mg adsorbent mass, pH 3.0, and agitation at 300 rpm for 30 min
at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C). Supernatants of the solutions
were collected from the liquid phase at predetermined time intervals,
and the analyte concentrations over time were verified.

The
same conditions were used in equilibrium tests, where concentrations
of multicomponent parabens varied from 1 to 20 mg L–1, and samples were kept in contact with the adsorbent for 30 min.

Equilibrium adsorption isotherm curves, which show the relationship
between the solid-phase concentration “qe” of the adsorbed solute (mg g–1)
and its concentration (Ce) in the liquid
phase (mg L–1), were built according to the Langmuir
(eq 2) and Freundlich
(eq 3) equations. 2   3  where Ce and qe were previously defined; qmax is the
monolayer capacity of the adsorbent (mg g–1); KL is the Langmuir
adsorption constant, which is related to the energy of adsorption
(L mg–1); and Kf (L
mg–1) and n are the Freundlich
adsorption isotherm constants related to the saturation capacity and
intensity of adsorption, respectively.

2.6 HPLC/DAD
Analyses
Quantitative analyses
were performed using a liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Shimadzu, 20A
prominence) with a UV-DAD detector (SPD-M20A) and column-C18 (Hichrom5),
with 250 × 4.6 mm2 i.d, and 5 μm particle size.
MeOH/acetic acid 0.1% as mobile phase was carried out in an isocratic
gradient (70:30),30 respectively, for 15
min and 1.0 mL flow. The column temperature was kept at 35°C.
The injection volume was 20 μL and detection, UV, at 256 nm.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Sample
Characterization
3.1.1 XRF Analysis
The chemical compositions
of fly ashes without treatment (FA) and after acid treatment (FA-AT)
are listed in Table 3. Fly ashes present diversified physical, chemical, and mineralogical
characteristics. This variability is mainly related to the industrial
process by which they were obtained.9

Table 3 Content of the Oxides Based on XRF
Analysis (m/m%)
sample	SiO2	Fe2O3	Al2O3	K2O	CaO	TiO2	Na2O	other	
FA	33.07	33.61	19.81	4.99	4.46	1.75	 	2.31	
FA-AT	57.40	21.72	9.07	4.17	2.94	2.96	 	1.74	
FA-AT13	51.23	8.99	27.08	3.37	 	 	7.96	1.36	
FA-AT11	75.87	6.76	11.33	4.16	 	 	 	1.88	
FA-AT9	94.27	0.90	3.04	1.13	 	 	 	0.66	
FA-AT7	91.76	1.10	5.67	1.11	 	 	 	0.36	
It can be observed in Table 3 that the FA chemical
compositions are mainly due to the presence
of oxides of silicon, iron, aluminum, potassium, calcium, and titanium.
Different oxides, such as SrO and Y2O3, are
also detected; however, they are found at low concentrations (below
1%). The acid treatment reduced the presence of aluminum, iron, and
calcium oxides, which results in an increase in silica by 24.33%.
Yilmaz and Mermer10 studied the synthesis
of MCM-41 from fly ash, and according to them, a higher Si/Al ratio
is related to the best ability to form mesoporous silica. In the present
study, the Si/Al ratios were 1.47 and 5.59 for FA and FA-AT, respectively,
suggesting that the FA-AT material presents a higher mesoporous silica
formation potential.

Table 1 shows the
XRF analysis results for synthesized materials. According to the Table,
the FA-AT9 and FA-AT7 samples showed higher SiO2 content
(above 90%) compared to others (below 80%). Considerable fractions
of Fe2O3, Al2O3, and K2O composed the FA-AT11 material (about 22%). In the FA-AT13
material, a significant presence of Fe2O3, Al2O3, K2O (about 40%), and Na2O (7.96%) was noted. Other components are around or below 1% by mass.
Chao23 studied the pH effect on the MCM-41
synthesis process from fly ash, and they found greater incorporation
of metallic ions into the structure of the synthesized material at
high pH, which was observed in the present study for FA-AT13 and FA-AT11
materials.

3.1.2 XRD Analysis
Figure 1 shows high-angle
X-ray diffractograms of
FA and synthesized samples. According to FA XRD patterns (Figure 1a), the identified
crystalline phases were mainly quartz, hematite, and magnetite.

Figure 1 High-angle
X-ray diffractograms of (a) FA, (b) FA-AT13, (c) FA-AT11,
(d) FA-AT9, and (e) FA-AT7.

It is observed that in the samples FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7
(Figure 1c–e),
the XRD pattern presented amorphous phase silica characterized by
a low-intensity signal at around 26°.24 However, crystalline phases were identified in the FA-AT13 sample
(Figure 1b), indicating
the formation of a mixture of zeolites X and Y.

The disappearance
of the identified crystalline phases observed
in FA or even the formation of new phases in the case of zeolite synthesis
suggests that the silica in its natural crystalline form in FA has
reacted with NaOH during the silicon extraction step, giving rise
to soluble sodium silicate and subsequent formation of new materials.31 According to Chang et al.,32 an eventual absence of formation of the MCM mesoporous
material can be explained to be due to the high concentration of sodium
ions. In spite of the high content of sodium ions present in the fly
ash supernatant, the formation of Al-MCM-41 and MCM-41 type materials
can be worked out by means of controlled pH conditions.31,33−35 Thus, mesoporous silica synthesis is highly dependent
on the pH of the reaction mixture.35 In
the present work, the FA-AT13 sample showed the formation of a crystalline
mixture of zeolites X and Y instead of the formation of mesoporous
silica. This phenomenon is possibly due to reaction conditions, such
as high amounts of sodium ions, which above a key concentration may
act as a structure-directing agent,34 and
the high pH value of the reaction mixture.

To investigate the
existence of an ordered arrangement compatible
to mesoporous structures, low-angle X-ray analyses were performed
for the samples of FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7 materials (Figure 2). An intense peak
(100) was observed for all three samples, which is indicative of the
presence of MCM-41 type mesoporous silica.24,35 The highest intensity peak can be observed for samples FA-AT9 and
FA-AT7 and might be interpreted as an indication of the higher ordering
of the mesoporous channels.34,35 However, the diffraction
peaks (110) and (200), which are characteristic of the formation of
the ordered hexagonal pore structure, were not observed.10,35

X-ray diffractograms of FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7.

3.1.3 IR Analysis
The FTIR spectroscopy
technique has been used extensively for the identification of the
functional group of nanomaterials. The broad band at around 3500 cm–1 may be attributed to surface silanol groups and physically
adsorbed water molecules,23,24,35 while deformational vibrations of adsorbed water molecules caused
the absorption bands at 1636 cm–1.23,35,36 The bands between 460 and 1250
cm–1 are assigned to framework vibrations of mesoporous
silica. The asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration bands of
framework Si-O-Si appearing at 1082 and 800 cm–1, respectively, are assigned to the porous silica material.23,36

In the spectra of the FA-AT13 sample (Figure 3a), it is possible to see two signals consistent
with the faujasite zeolite group, a band at 670 cm–1, which is related to symmetric stretching due to internal vibrations
and a band at 560 cm–1 associated with the double-six-ring
(D6R).37,38

materials.

3.1.4 Scanning
Electron Microscopy Analysis (SEM)
SEM images of FA and the
synthesized materials are shown in Figure 4. In the micrographs
of the fly ash sample (Figure 4a,b), it is possible to observe that the ashes are formed
in the majority by hollow spheres, namely, cenospheres. A remarkable
structural change in the materials is noticed after modification (Figure 4c–f). Other
researchers who studied coal fly ash found similar morphologies.9,31,34,39 In the FA-AT13 micrographs (Figure 4c), the formation of crystalline structures has been
identified, which were previously identified by XRD analysis as a
mixture of X and Y zeolite phases. In the inset (Figure 4c), the high-resolution image
shows that there are structures with needle-like morphologies and
others with faceted crystals that may possibly be the two phases of
the zeolites identified in XRD analysis. On the other hand, FA-AT11,
FA-AT9, and FA-AT7 present particles of smaller size and agglomerates
typical of mesoporous silica (Figure 4d–f).10

and (f) FA-AT7. The yellow inset in (4c) corresponds
to the high-resolution region of the image, and the scale bar value
is 4 μm.

3.1.5 Transmission
Electron Microscopy Analysis
(TEM)
By means of the TEM technique, it was possible to carry
out larger increases for the materials FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7
in more specific regions to elucidate the morphology of the materials. Figure 5 shows TEM images
for FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7 materials.

Figure 5 TEM images for (a, d)
FA-AT11, (b, e) FA-AT9, and (c, f) FA-AT7
materials.

The TEM images show that all materials
have numerous pores of different
sizes on the surface, corroborating with the data presented in the
surface area technique. Although the XRD data at a low angle indicated
that all samples have some arrangement, indicated by the presence
of the main diffraction peak assigned to the plane (100) of the MCM-41
structure, the TEM images indicated ordering only in samples FA-AT9
and FA-AT7, Figure 5e,f, respectively. The cause may be the treatment at alkaline pH
for this class of materials, which is found to be less aggressive
when compared to the one performed for samples FA-AT11 and FA-AT13
because the latter presented the formation of zeolitic structures.
It is known that SiO2 structures in the presence of high
basic media can undergo structural collapse and can interfere in the
hydrolysis of the TEOS reaction, in addition to the fact that the
surfactant micelles in strongly alkaline media can lose shape/morphology
and thus lead to the formation of disordered structures.40

3.1.6 N2 Adsorption–Desorption
Isotherm Analysis
N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) curves of the synthesized
samples are shown in Figure 6. The isotherms for FA-AT13 (Figure 6a) are classified as I type, related to microporous
materials with a relatively small surface area and pores with narrow
openings (pore width <1 nm) such as zeolite materials.41 In the PSD curve (Figure 6b), the peak below 10 Å confirms the
existence of micropores.

Figure 6 N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
at 77 K and
pore size distribution curves for (a, b) FA-AT13, (c, d) FA-AT11,
(e, f) FA-AT9, and (g, h) FA-AT7 materials.

The isotherms for FA-AT11, FA-AT9, and FA-AT7 materials exhibit
hysteresis loops demonstrating the presence of mesopores (Figure 6c,e,g), which can
be classified as IV type.41 The pore size
distribution (Figure 6d,f,h) shows, for the three samples, peaks centered in the range
of 30–52 Å, showing the presence of mesopores in both
materials. In the FA-AT7 sample, two peaks are identified, suggesting
the presence of bimodal mesopores with two types of pore sizes.24 Samples FA-AT11 and FA-AT9 presented narrower
pore size distributions.

The BET surface area and the pore volume
of the samples ranged
from 106 to 396 m2 g–1 and from 0.150
to 0.620 cm3 g–1, respectively, as listed
in Table 4. The FA-AT7
material showed the largest BET surface area (SBET) (396 m2 g–1) and pore volume
(0.62 cm3 g–1). Misran et al.34 studied the nonhydrothermal synthesis of mesoporous
materials at pHs 7, 10, and 13, and they found pH 7 as the optimal
value for the occurrence of the condensation–polymerization
process of the sodium silicate precursor.

Surface areas with
higher values have been reported in the literature,23,31,33−35 which may be
related to the presence of the silica. High-purity silica sources
are more reactive and have higher amounts of silicate anions present
in the process, which may imply condensation and hydrolysis of these
anions, resulting in a larger surface area.34

3.2 Paraben Adsorption
3.2.1 Adsorption
Tests
Adsorption capacities
of the synthesized materials for the homologous parabens (e.g., methylparaben,
ethylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben) are shown in Figure 7. It can be seen
that the adsorption efficiency of the materials follows the following
order: butylparaben FA-AT7 > FA-AT9 > FA-AT11 > FA-AT13;
propylparaben
FA-AT7 > FA-AT9 ≥ FA-AT11 > FA-AT13; ethylparaben FA-AT13
>
FA-AT7; methylparaben FA-AT13 > FA-AT7.

Figure 7 Initial adsorption tests
for synthesized materials. Conditions:
volume (40 mL), concentration (10 mg L–1), adsorbent
mass (150 mg), temperature (28 ± 2 °C), pH (5.0), and agitation
(300 rpm).

Thus, it is noted that FA-AT13
and FA-AT7 are able to remove all
of the parabens studied, which differ from FA-AT11 and FA-AT9 materials
that do not have the adsorptive capacity for methylparaben and ethylparaben
compounds. However, this was only an initial test without adjusting
the ideal conditions, so a better understanding of the process was
achieved in the following stages of the experimental design.

Although FA-AT13 has a greater ability of adsorption for methylparaben
and ethylparaben, however, its overall performance is surpassed by
FA-AT7, which has adsorption capacities of 0.01, 0.07, 0.54, and 1.31
mg g–1 for methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben,
and butylparaben, respectively. It is likely that the higher adsorptive
capacity of this material compared to the others can be due to its
characteristics (Table 4), such as the specific surface area, pore specific volume, pore
size distribution, and the adsorbate nature.42,43 This material was therefore chosen for subsequent adsorption studies.

The treatment carried out with FA-AT7 provided the largest BET
surface area (SBET) (396 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.52 cm3 g–1) and probably increased its hydrophobicity; as a
result, its adsorption capacity increases as the paraben hydrophobicity
increases. According to Cooney et al,42 the lower the solute solubility, the better the adsorption. Also,
an increase in the molecular size of the substituent group usually
enhances adsorption, especially for a homologous series of parabens.
There is, in fact, a generalization, known as Traube’s rule,
which states that “the adsorption of organic substances from
aqueous solutions increases strongly and regularly as we ascend the
homologous series”.42 Traube’s
rule in fact had originally been applied to the adsorption of solutes
from a polar solvent on a relatively nonpolar solid. A similar reversal
of Traube’s rule was observed in the case of adsorption from
a relatively nonpolar solvent by a polar solid. Examples are the short-chain
fatty acids (heptanoic acid) that adsorb on the calcite surface to
a lesser extent.44

3.2.2 Point of Zero Charge (pHPZC)
The solution
pH may affect the degree of ionization, functional
group dissociation, adsorbate structure, and adsorbent surface functionality.45 The pHpcz determination of an adsorbent
allows us to identify trends in the variations of surface charge as
a function of pH.46,47 pHpcz around 7.0 was
found for FA-AT7 (Figure 8a), indicating the presence of a positive surface charge in
solutions whose pH is below this value and a negative surface charge
at a higher pH.48 Nairi et al.49 studied pHpcz for mesoporous silicas
MCM-41 and SBA-15 types and found pHpcz to be around 6.0.

Figure 8 (a) FA-AT7
pHpcz results and (b) adsorption tests at
varying initial pH.

The adsorption performance
of FA-AT7, according to the pH, is shown
in Figure 8b. At pH
values 3, 5, and 7, an increase in the adsorption capacity with the
increase of the paraben molecular size (or hydrophobicity) can be
observed. On the other hand, there are no significant variations in
the paraben adsorption at pH values 3, 5, and 7, and this is due to
the pKa values of these compounds (Table 1). Since the parabens
are majorly in the neutral form in the studied pH range, which means
that there are no opposing charges, the electrostatic forces are not
predominant in the adsorption mechanism. Hydrophobic forces and/or
hydrogen bonds might be the principal adsorption mechanisms,50,51 taking into consideration the paraben proprieties studied (Table 1), mainly low water
solubility and log Kow, since there
is an increase in the adsorption capacity with the increase of the
paraben carbon chain. At pH 3, the adsorption capacity was higher;
thus, this pH was chosen for the later studies. At pH values 5 and
7 (values generally found in surface water),52−56 the material presented the adsorptive capacity approximate
to the results identified at pH 3, indicating no relevant interference
of this parameter in the studied range, which would facilitate the
application of the adsorbent for resolving practical environmental
problems.

3.2.3 Factorial Experimental
Design
The
factorial design methodology, unlike experiments that vary one factor
at a time, is an excellent tool for the individual study, as well
as for the interaction effects of all parameters simultaneously, since
the variables can influence each other and the ideal value for one
of these variables may depend on the values of other variables. This
interaction between variables is a recurrent phenomenon.48

The studied factors were as follows: (A)
adsorbent mass, (B) initial paraben concentration, and (C) agitation
rate. The FA-AT7 adsorption capacity was used as a response. Standardized
Pareto charts are shown in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Standardized Pareto charts showing the main effects of
experimental
parameters on responses at the confidence limit of 95% for (a) methylparaben,
(b) ethylparaben, (c) propylparaben, and (d) butylparaben.

The factor A showed a significant negative effect. At higher
mass
dosage, the probability of collisions between the adsorbent particles
is higher, generating aggregates, which might reduce the total surface
area and cause difficulty in the diffusion of the adsorbates into
the material surface.57 On the other hand,
the factor B showed a positive effect for all studied parabens, which
might be related to the increase in the driving force in the aqueous
phase, increasing the rate of diffusion.58 It is worth noting that A–B interaction factors showed a
negative effect, which means that although the initial concentration
parameter has an individual positive effect, the increase of the two
factors from the lower to the higher level reduced the adsorption
capacity of the material.

The factor C showed a positive effect
for methyl and ethylparabens,
indicating that the increase of the agitation speed favored the interactions
between the adsorbate and adsorbent, possibly due to its contribution
in the process of mass transfer.43 While
the interaction effect of agitation with the adsorbent mass (AC) is
negative, the interaction of the same variable with the initial concentration
of the analytes (BC) is positive, only for methylparaben. These results
can be justified by the strong effect of adsorbent mass and initial
concentration factors, indicating a considerable influence on their
interaction.

3.2.4 Adsorption Kinetics
Based on the
factorial experimental design results, for the kinetics and equilibrium
tests, the adsorbent mass and agitation conditions were set at 2 mg
and 300 rpm, respectively. Regarding the parabens’ initial
concentration, the value used was 5 mg L–1. This
concentration was selected considering the levels of parabens detected
in the aquatic environment1,4 and the HPLC system
used in quantification.

The equilibrium time for multicomponent
adsorption of parabens onto the FA-AT7 adsorbent is shown in Figure 10. The paraben adsorption
process in the mesoporous silica investigated is fast, with an equilibrium
time reached in approximately 5 to 10 min.

Figure 10 Time of equilibrium
for multicomponent adsorption of parabens onto
the FA-AT7 adsorbent. Conditions: 5 mg L–1, pH 3.0,
stirring rate: 300 rpm, mass adsorbent: 2.0 mg, and temperature (28
± 2 °C).

Barczak et al.59 found fast adsorption;
only a few minutes were needed to approach 90% of equilibrium values
for diclofenac onto mesoporous silica. These authors associated their
results with the medium pore size of the materials and, consequently,
facilitated the diffusion of the molecules inside them.

3.2.5 Adsorption Equilibrium
It can be
seen in Figure 11 that
the experimental adsorption isotherm is linear (type-III), indicating
that the mass of adsorbate retained per unit adsorbent mass is proportional
to the adsorbate equilibrium concentration in the fluid phase.

Figure 11 Experimental
and theoretical isotherms of (a) methylparaben, (b)
ethylparaben, (c) propylparaben, and (d) butylparaben onto the FA-AT7
adsorbent in the multicomponent system. Conditions: 5 mg L–1, pH 3.0, stirring rate: 300 rpm, mass adsorbent: 2.0 mg, and temperature
(28 ± 2 °C).

The adjustment using
the Langmuir model is not adequate to estimate
the Qmáx, which is evidenced by
the high error values obtained (Table 5). The Freundlich model was better adjusted to the
experimental data. KF and 1/n values indicated the following order: methylparaben < ethylparaben
< propylparaben < butylparaben, which indicates a higher material
surface heterogeneity effect for methylparaben (higher “n” value), leading to a strong interaction between
the adsorbate and adsorbent. 1/n values above 1 indicate cooperative
adsorption, which means that interactions between species of adsorbates
are present in the system.60,61 Other studies also
found a better fit using the Freundlich model in mesoporous materials.45,62,63

4 Conclusions
The
pH effect played a role in the mesoporous silica synthesis
process; at pH 7, a more ordered structure and a higher surface area
and pore volume were found, leading to an adsorbent with good efficiency
to adsorb paraben compounds, and at pH 13, the formation of microporous
crystalline structures such as X- and Y-zeolites is favored. Fly ash
acid treatment prior to the syntheses was important to reduce metallic
impurities in fly ash. The adsorption capacity of mesoporous silica
increased with the molecular mass of the parabens; thus, propyl and
butyl parabens were adsorbed more than others, probably due to their
higher hydrophobicity.
