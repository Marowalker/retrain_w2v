Low-temperature
crystal defect dynamics in Si has been studied
by a newly developed cryo-high-voltage electron microscopy. The planar
{113} defects of self-interstitial atoms were introduced at 94 K by
1 MeV electron irradiation with damage higher than 0.42 displacements
per atom (dpa), unlike past findings. The defects once grew and then
shrunk during the observation. We show that the nucleation and the
dissociation dynamics of the {113} defects can be attributed to an
athermal process, which is deduced from anomalously fast diffusion
of self-interstitial atoms at a low temperature.

Introduction
High-voltage
transmission electron microscopy (HVEM) is a powerful
tool to characterize interior structures of a micrometer-thick specimen
with a high spatial resolution. To date, a plenty of useful findings
regarding materials physics such as crystal defects, phase transition,
and mechanical properties have been obtained by HVEM.1−3 Recently, installation of a high-performance direct electron detection
(DED) CMOS camera has significantly improved the performance of the
HVEM. For example, structural dynamics of nanoparticles has been revealed
in sub-millisecond to a millisecond time scale,4,5 which
could not be detected by a conventional CCD camera so far. As a result,
in addition to the high spatial resolution and high penetration power,6,7 the latest HVEM opens up a new horizon for in situ characterization
of materials’ structure–property relationships. Recent
developments of the HVEM are not limited to the aforementioned detection
system; we have successfully installed a cryogenic specimen stage
to our HVEM (cryo-HVEM). In general, cryo-EM (typically, 200–300
kV-class TEM) has been used to observe biological samples and soft
materials that are sensitive to electron radiation damage.8−12 It features an imaging system capable of observing images with a
low electron dose together with a dedicated specimen stage cooled
by liquid nitrogen. In our newly developed cryo-HVEM, up to 12 specimens
are stored in the inner storage that is always cooled with liquid
nitrogen, and a selected specimen is transferred to the observation
position in the pole piece gap by the autoloader system.

Radiation
damage in silicon (Si) induced by MeV electron irradiation
has been studied for over 40 years. The main conclusion is that in
most cases, point defects and their assemblies such as {113} defects
are introduced by MeV electron irradiation above room temperature,
especially at 673–823 K,13−16 and amorphization can only be realized under limited
conditions at low temperatures with a high electron dose.17,18 Here, we report on the structural properties of a Si single crystal
at a low temperature obtained using the novel cryo-HVEM. Mechanical
stability of our new cryo-HVEM makes the atomic resolution observation
possible at liquid nitrogen temperature. By low-dose observation using
a DED camera, we observed formation of planar {113} defects of self-interstitials
even at a low temperature.

Results
Figure 1a shows
a high-resolution TEM (HREM) image of Si obtained at 94 K with beam
incidence in the [110]Si. The observation was performed
at an area about 500 nm from the specimen edge (“edge”
means the boundary between the specimen and a hole opened by the Ar
ion milling). As seen, Si(110) dumbbells, 136 pm in distance, are
observed as lattice images. The corresponding fast Fourier transform
(FFT) pattern is shown in Figure 1b. The unusual diffuse contrast from the top left to
the bottom right of the image is due to drift correction (<100
pm) and image integration. It is worth noting that 008 reflection
seen in the FFT pattern, which corresponds to 67 pm in real space
indicates the mechanical stability of the cryo-stage kept at 94 K.
Also, 4̅40 reflection (96 pm) is seen in the orthogonal direction. Figure 1c shows a selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern obtained from an area ∼600
nm in diameter. Note that the pattern is free from a halo ring of
amorphous SiO2: a surface-damaged layer by Ar ion milling
is presumed to be extremely thin.

K. The beam incidence is

Figure 2 shows a
representative HREM image of Si including lattice defects observed
with beam incidence in the [110]Si. The corresponding FFT
pattern is shown in the inset. During the observation with a dose
rate of 12.4 e/pixel s (550 e/Å2s) for a couple of
minutes, such defect contrast suddenly appeared. It was found that
the defect is the planar {113} defects of self-interstitials elongated
in the <332> direction. The {113} defect was firstly found in
electron-irradiated
Ge,19 and then the atomic structure of
the defect formed in Si was revealed in detail by TEM.16,20,21 The appearance of the {113} defects
in Si at 94 K is curious since this type of defects is known to appear
by MeV electron irradiation at temperatures above room temperature.13−16

corresponding FFT pattern is shown in the inset.

Figure 3 shows a
series of HREM images obtained in situ with a dose rate of 18 e/pixel
s (800 e/Å2s). The observation was performed at a
thick area about 5 μm from the specimen edge. Thickness of the
observed area is presumed to be at most 700 nm (this was estimated
by our preliminary work using electron energy-loss spectroscopy).
In Figure 3a (2 min
after the start of observation), there is no defect contrast in the
observed area. After 13 min observation (received damage of 0.42 displacements
per atom (dpa)), a fine defect ∼3 nm in length appeared as
shown in the circle (Figure 3b). It grew as the irradiation proceeds and reached 6 nm in
length after 15 min irradiation (Figure 3c, 0.48 dpa) and kept its size until 21 min
irradiation (Figure 3d, 0.67 dpa). After 23 min irradiation (Figure 3e, 0.74 dpa), the defect shrunk, and a new
defect as shown by an arrow appeared alternatively in the immediate
vicinity. The appearance of new defects in a short time (<2 min)
indicates that the clustering of self-interstitials of Si is a very
fast event even at 94 K. Both these defects seen in Figure 3e were maintained after 27
min irradiation (0.87 dpa, not shown), while they disappeared after
35 min irradiation (Figure 3f, 1.14 dpa).

We also investigated the defects’ motion under prolonged
irradiation at 94 K. After obtaining the image shown in Figure 3f (35 min irradiation, 1.14
dpa), we found formation of another defect in the field of view. Figure 4a shows an HREM image
of the above newly formed {113} defect observed after 40 min irradiation
(5 min irradiation after the formation, total damage: 1.27 dpa). As
seen, the defect gradually shrunk with irradiation (Figure 4b–d), while it once
regrew after 60 min irradiation (Figure 4e, 1.95 dpa), and it shrunk again after 67
min (Figure 4f, 2.15
dpa). As shown in Figures 3 and 4, it was found that the {113}
defects were generated and then disappeared at about 30 min intervals
during the 1 MeV electron irradiation at 94 K. These results imply
that dynamics of the planar {113} defects of self-interstitials can
be attributed to an athermal process.

Figure 5a,b shows
irradiation time dependence of the length of {113} defects in the
<332> direction extracted from the results obtained in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. Although the defocus was fine-tuned so that
sharp defect contrast can be obtained, the measured length is the
apparent value since the size and shape of a planar {113} defect in
the [110] direction (electron propagation direction) are unknown.
The error bars were estimated from the spread of the defect contrast
in the direction perpendicular to the defect plane. As seen, defects
are formed and grown, and after maintaining a certain size for a while,
they tend to disappear by further irradiation. We deduced the diffusivity
of self-interstitials to be 3.8–7.5 × 10–20 m2/s for the grown ones and 4.3–6.4 × 10–20 m2/s for the shrunk ones. According to
the literature,22 the obtained diffusivity
corresponds to a value expected for self-diffusion of self-interstitials
at 1250 K (a frequency factor of 0.53 m2/s and an activation
energy of 4.75 eV were used for estimation). Thus, diffusion of self-interstitials
is significantly enhanced under 1 MeV electron irradiation at 94 K.
This result indicates that the defects’ motion is not a thermally
activated process under the present experimental conditions.

Discussion
Formation of {113} defects by MeV electron irradiation has been
extensively studied in the temperature range above room temperature,
especially at 673–823 K.13,14,16 Vanhellemont et al. reported that rate of the {113} defects formation
under 2 MeV electron irradiation is reduced at room temperature compared
to that of at 573 K.23 Also note that the
{113} defects are formed at relatively high temperatures, while voids
are introduced at lower temperatures as reported in the literature.24 The experimentally determined border of the
formation temperature between {113} defects and voids is in the temperature
range between 100 and 200 K.24 In this
study, we found that the {113} defects are also introduced by 1 MeV
electron irradiation at 94 K. The irradiation temperature of 94 K
is just below the lower limit of the aforementioned border. Electron
dose required for the defect formation was in the order of 1025 e/m2, which is comparable to those reported on
most of the previous studies (1025–1026 e/m2). It has been reported that increasing the oxygen
content in Si reduces the formation rate of the {113} defects,23 while increasing the partial pressure of oxygen
in the atmosphere enhances the defect formation.25 Oxygen acts as a sink for vacancies, forming V–O
pairs, which eventually leads to recombination with interstitials.23,26 In this study, low-energy ion milling effectively reduced surface
oxide and a possible damaged layer, as evidenced by the fact that
obvious halo rings of amorphous SiO2 was not observed in
the SAED pattern (Figure 1c) as well as the FFT patterns of HREM images (Figure 1b, inset of Figures 2 and 3a); the specimen surface will be coated by thin native oxide. The
specimen chamber of the cryo-HVEM is evacuated by turbo-molecular
pumps and sputter-ion pumps and maintains a vacuum of approximately
1 × 10–5 Pa during the observation. Furthermore,
since the cryogenic specimen stage is cooled with liquid nitrogen
all the time, residual H2O vapor will be eliminated by
adsorption. Thus, electron irradiation was performed in a clean condition
excluding contamination sources as much as possible.

Similar
phenomena, the formation and disappearance of {113} defects,
as observed in this study, were previously found by 1 MeV irradiation
at room temperature.15 The motion of the
defects was reported at the electron dose of 0.6–1.3 ×
1026 e/m2, and these values are almost equivalent
to the dose used in this study. As we have shown in the present study,
the {113} defect formation, usually induced at higher temperatures,
also occurs at a low temperature. Such a low-temperature structural
dynamics indicates an athermal process as the formation mechanism
of the {113} defect, and it also explains the dissociation of the
defects during the 1 MeV electron irradiation at 94 K. Since the dynamics
is not a thermally activated process, {113} defects are presumed to
be able to grow and shrink at a very high speed as observed in this
study. It should be noted that the {113} plane of the diamond structure
consists of 12 equivalent planes, and when a {113} defect satisfies
the edge-on condition with respect to the incident electron beam,
the linear defect contrast can be clearly observed, as shown in Figures 2–4. It is presumed that the disappearance of the defects
under 1 MeV electron irradiation is due to migration of interstitial
atoms to an equivalent plane, which does not satisfy the edge-on condition,
or annihilation at the specimen surface. Shrinkage of the defects
can also be explained by the purification of the irradiated area by
the absorption of pre-existing impurities into interstitial clusters.27 Since {113} defects are not formed in a thin
region near the specimen edge,16 observation
in a thick region is essential for such defect dynamics characterization.
The veiled phenomenon was hence detected by the experiment simultaneously
satisfying the following three conditions using a sufficiently thick
specimen: low temperatures (<100 K), high-energy electron irradiation
(1 MeV), and atomic resolution. Thus, we have demonstrated that the
novel cryo-HVEM has a high potential in a research of irradiation-induced
defects and their dynamics.

Regarding lattice defects characterization
of a thick specimen,
the authors recently demonstrated that bright-field scanning transmission
electron microscopy (BF-STEM) mode in the HVEM shows extreme penetration
power.6 In fact, it has been demonstrated
that dislocations in Si can be observed even at a thickness of 14
μm using the 1 MV-STEM.28,29 In this study, we focused
on HREM imaging using the cryo-HVEM, while in the future, STEM in
cryo-HVEM has potential to reveal crystal defects in a thicker specimen
that can be regarded as a bulk.

Conclusions
We
have studied lattice defects dynamics in Si at 94 K using a
newly developed cryo-HVEM operating at 1 MV. Lattice images resolved
Si(110) dumbbells of 136 pm distance, and the FFT pattern of the image
showed the 008 reflection corresponding to 67 pm in real space. We
found that the planar {113} defects of self-interstitial atoms, usually
formed at temperatures above room temperature, appear at 94 K by 1
MeV electron irradiation with a damage higher than 0.42 dpa. The defects
once grew and then shrunk during the observation. The diffusivity
of self-interstitials at 94 K during 1 MeV electron irradiation was
deduced to 10–20 m2/s in order, which
corresponds to a value of self-diffusion of self-interstitials at
1250 K. High-diffusivity at a low temperature indicates that the {113}
defect dynamics can be attributed to an athermal process instead of
a thermally activated process. We show that novel cryo-HVEM has a
high potential in the research of irradiation-induced defects and
their dynamics.

Methods
TEM specimens of a Si single
crystal were prepared in the following
manner. First, a small piece of Si(110) wafer (Cz, p-type, 8–12
Ω cm) approximately 2 × 2 × 0.5 mm3 in
size was glued on a Mo single hole grid 3 mm in diameter. Then, the
crystal was thinned by mechanical polishing, and finally, a small
hole was made at the center of the specimen by low-energy Ar ion milling.
The prepared specimen was cooled using liquid nitrogen and then transferred
to the specimen stage of the cryo-HVEM. We confirmed that the area
of interest of the sample was not broken or damaged by immersion in
liquid nitrogen. Microstructures of the specimens prepared as above
and loaded on the cryogenic stage were characterized by JEOL JEM-1000EES
cryo-HVEM installed in Osaka University operating at 1 MV equipped
with a LaB6 cathode. The spherical aberration coefficient
(Cs) and the chromatic aberration coefficient
(Cc) of the cryo-HVEM are 4.1 mm and 5.1
mm, respectively. The stage temperature was kept at 94 K during the
TEM observation. Electron imaging as well as electron irradiation
were performed with a beam incidence in the [110]Si direction.
HREM images were recorded using a DED camera (Gatan K2 summit, 4k
× 4k). HREM images were obtained with a dose rate of 5.5 ×
1022–8.0 × 1022 e/m2 s
(550–800 e/Å2s). Note that the K2 summit camera
can be operated at low electron doses, and it accepts at most 20 e/pixel
s (890 e/Å2s). The cross section (σ) of atomic
displacements of Si was estimated to be 67.1 barns (67.1 × 10–28 m2) under 1 MeV electron irradiation
based on the McKinley–Feshbach formula30 for the collision between an electron of charge e and a nucleus of charge Ze: 1  where Z is
the atomic number, m is the rest mass of electron, c is the velocity of light, v is the velocity
of electron with β = v/c and
γ = (1 – β2)−1/2, Tm is the maximum recoil energy, and Td is the displacement threshold energy (Td = 13 eV31 and Tm = 155 eV for Si under 1 MeV electron irradiation).
The size of each HREM image is 3710 × 3390 pixels with a pixel
size of 0.015 nm. Each image was taken at an exposure time of 0.8
s, and a total of 10 images were integrated with drift correction.
SAED patterns were recorded using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera
(Gatan Orius SC200, 2k × 2k).
