Cytosolic
phospholipase A2 (GIVA cPLA2) has
attracted great interest as a medicinal target because it initiates
the eicosanoid cascade and is involved in a number of inflammatory
diseases. As a consequence, the development of potent synthetic inhibitors
is of great importance. We have developed highly potent 2-oxoester
inhibitors of GIVA cPLA2 presenting XI(50) values between 0.000019 and 0.000066. We demonstrate
that the 2-oxoester functionality is essential for in vitro inhibitory
activity, making these inhibitors useful research reagents. However,
their high reactivity results in rapid degradation of the inhibitors
in human plasma, limiting their pharmaceutical utility without further
modification.

Introduction
Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) have attracted
great interest as medicinal targets for more than 20 years because
they are involved in a number of inflammatory diseases.1 Among this superfamily of enzymes,2 cytosolic PLA2 (GIVA cPLA2) stands out because it exhibits a marked preference for the hydrolysis
of arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of phospholipid substrates
releasing arachidonic acid and initiating the eicosanoid cascade.3 Both the physiological function and the role
of cytosolic PLA2 have been recently summarized by Leslie.4 Due to the involvement of PLA2s in
various inflammatory diseases, many synthetic inhibitors have been
developed in both academia and pharmaceutical companies.1 Two recent review articles discuss the classes
of PLA2 inhibitors and highlight the in vitro activities
and selectivity and the in vivo studies in animal models.5,6

Most recently, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
dose-escalation
first-in-man study to assess the safety and efficacy of a topical
cytosolic PLA2 inhibitor AVX001 (1, Figure 1) in patients with
mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis has demonstrated that treatment
with AVX001 is well tolerated in doses up to 5%.7 Pharmacological inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 by
inhibitor 2 (Figure 1) blocked Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced polymorphonuclear cells transepithelial migration in vitro,
suggesting that this enzyme plays a crucial role in eliciting pulmonary
inflammation during pneumococcal infection.8 The daily administration of the indole-based inhibitor ASB14780
(3, Figure 1), which had been developed by Tomoo and colleagues,9 markedly ameliorated liver injury and hepatic fibrosis
following 6 weeks of treatment with CCl4, indicating that
a GIVA cPLA2 inhibitor could be useful for the treatment
of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, including fatty liver and hepatic
fibrosis.10 A few years ago, we presented
new thiazolyl ketones as inhibitors of GIVA cPLA2 and demonstrated
the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of inhibitor GK470 (4, Figure 1) in a collagen-induced
arthritis model.11 The anti-angiogenic
effects of this inhibitor (now named as AVX235) in a patient-derived
triple-negative basal-like breast cancer model was evaluated and significant
tumor growth inhibition was observed after 8 days of treatment.12 Most recent findings showed that blockage of
GIVA cPLA2 by either inhibitor 2 or pyrrophenone
(5, Figure 1) sensitized aggressive breast cancer to doxorubicin by suppressing
ERK and mTOR kinases.13

Figure 1 Structures of known GIVA
cPLA2 inhibitors.

All of the above-described recent applications of synthetic
GIVA
cPLA2 inhibitors highlight the importance of identifying
new highly potent inhibitors to regulate the activity of GIVA cPLA2. Last year, we reported the development of a novel class
of GIVA cPLA2 inhibitors, namely, 2-oxoesters.14 2-Oxoester GK452 (6, Figure 1), containing a biphenyl system
and a free carboxyl group, led to highly potent and selective GIVA
cPLA2 in vitro inhibition (XI(50) 0.000078). The aim of the present work was to further understand
the characteristics of 2-oxoesters and explore the possibility of
producing more potent GIVA cPLA2 inhibitors.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Inhibitors
To extend the structure–activity
relationship studies on 2-oxoester inhibitors, we (a) shortened the
length between the activated carbonyl group and the biphenyl functionality,
(b) replaced the biphenyl system with a para-alkoxy-substituted
phenyl group, and (c) explored the importance of the activated carbonyl
group. To this end, a variety of 2-substituted carboxylic acids, required
for the target compounds, were synthesized as described in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 The synthesis of carboxylic
acids 13, 15, and 16, bearing
a 4-butoxy-phenyl group, started with
the Wadsworth–Horner–Emmons olefination reaction of
aldehydes 7a, 7b(15) with triethyl phosphonocrotonate to give the corresponding unsaturated
esters 8a,b, which were hydrogenated to compounds 9a,b. The reduction of 9a led to alcohol 10, which subsequently provided cyanohydrin 11. Subsequent treatment with HCl in methanol gave 2-hydroxy methyl
ester 12, which was then saponified to 2-hydroxy acid 13 by treatment with aqueous NaOH. Treatment of 12 with the fluorinating agent diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST)16 resulted in 2-fluoro methyl ester 14, consequently providing 2-fluoro carboxylic acid 15 after saponification. The carboxylic acid 16 was also
obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of 9b. The synthesis
of 2-hydroxy acid 20 was accomplished by similar procedures
starting from aldehyde 17,17 as depicted in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 The key step in the synthesis of 2-oxoesters
was the reaction between
cesium salt of 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids with appropriate tert-butyl bromoalkanoate 22a,b(14) (Scheme 3). 2-Hydroxy esters 23a–d, obtained from 2-hydroxy carboxylic acids 13, 20, and the previously synthesized 21,14 were then oxidized to the corresponding 2-oxoesters 24a–d using the Dess–Martin periodinane
reagent. Cleavage of tert-butyl protecting group
led to the target compounds 25a–d (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Likewise, reaction
of 2-fluoro carboxylic acid 15 and
acid 16 with tert-butyl bromopentanoate
(22b) resulted in derivatives 26a,b, and
subsequently, after the removal of tert-butyl group,
to the desired products 27a,b (Scheme 4). Finally, the synthesis of 2-oxoacid 29 was accomplished as shown in Scheme 5 by saponification of the corresponding 2-oxoester 28 under mild conditions.

Scheme 4 Scheme 5 In Vitro Inhibition of
GIVA cPLA2, GVIA iPLA2, and GV sPLA2
All of the new compounds
synthesized were tested for in vitro inhibition of human GIVA cPLA2, calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (GVIA iPLA2), and secreted phospholipase A2 (GV sPLA2) using previously described mixed micelle-based assays.18−20 The inhibition results are presented in Table 1, either as percent inhibition or as XI(50) values. At first, the percent of inhibition
for each PLA2 enzyme at a high mole fraction (0.091) of
each inhibitor was determined. Then, the XI(50) values were measured for compounds that displayed more than
95% inhibition. The XI(50) is the mole
fraction of the inhibitor in the total substrate interface required
to inhibit the enzyme by 50%.

a Calculated with ChemDraw.

b % Inhibition at 0.091 mol fraction
of each inhibitor.

Because
it is an important property of GIVA cPLA2 inhibitors,
the Clog P values for all the compounds tested,
calculated by ChemDraw, are also included in Table 1. The Clog P value
is a measure of hydrophobicity and represents the calculated partition
coefficient in octanol/water on a logarithmic scale.

Inhibitor 6 (GK452) (XI(50) 0.000078)14 is included in Table 1 for comparison purposes.
When the distance between the oxoester functionality and the biphenyl
system was decreased from four to two carbon atoms (compound 25c (GK482) and compound 25d (GK483)), the inhibitory
potency against GIVA cPLA2 considerably decreased. This
decrease was 1 order of magnitude in the case of a four-carbon linker
(compound 25cXI(50) 0.00041),
further decreasing (2 orders of magnitude) when the linker was further
shortened (25dXI(50) 0.0012).
These results are in accordance with our previous results14 and confirm that the optimum distance between
the free carboxyl group and the oxoester functionality corresponds
to four carbon atoms. In addition, compound 25c lost
the selectivity because the inhibition of GVIA iPLA2 was
observed (XI(50) 0.0030). Thus, the four-carbon
linker was maintained for all the other derivatives. The optimum length
of the linker may be correlated with stereochemical reasons, rather
than hydrophobicity.

Interestingly, when one ring of the biphenyl
system was replaced
by a para-hexyloxy group, an increase in the inhibitor
potency against GIVA cPLA2 was observed. Compound 25b (GK484) is the most potent inhibitor of GIVA cPLA2 ever reported with a XI(50) value
of 0.000019, 4 times more potent than 6. However, the
replacement of the phenyl ring by the hexyloxy group resulted in an
increase in the Clog P value (from 4.70 for 6 to 5.37 for 25b). Thus, we shortened the hexyloxy
chain to butyloxy one. Compound 25a (GK504) (XI(50) 0.000066) is 3 times less potent than 25b, but still slightly more potent than 6. In
addition, its Clog P value (4.31) is lower
than 5, which is favorable because Lipinski’s “rule
of 5” predicts that poor absorption or permeation is more likely
when CLog P is greater than 5.21 Neither 25b nor 25a presented significant inhibition of GVIA iPLA2 (86 and
77%, respectively, at a high mole fraction 0.091). In our experience,
compounds that show inhibition of PLA2 less than 90% at
the highest concentration tested (which corresponds to about 50 μM
inhibitor) always exhibit XI(50) values
greater than 0.01.11,23 The GIVA cPLA2 inhibitor 25b with a XI(50) 0.000019 is
the most potent inhibitor of GIVA cPLA2 ever reported and
is at least 500-fold selective over GVIA iPLA2.

To
confirm the importance of the oxoester functionality, we removed
the activated carbonyl group. Compound 27a (GK505) abolished
the inhibitory potency against GIVA cPLA2. Because the
only structural difference between 27a and 25a is the lack of the carbonyl group, a comparison of the inhibitory
potencies of 25a and 27a makes it clear
that the carbonyl group of the oxoester functionality is essential
for GIVA cPLA2 inhibition. To explore if an electron-withdrawing
group at position 2 could contribute to the inhibitory potency, the
fluoro derivative 27b (GK506) was studied. However, again,
no inhibition of GIVA cPLA2 was observed. Finally, 2-oxoacid 29 (GK511) was evaluated in vitro and only a very weak inhibition
of GIVA cPLA2 was recorded (55% at a high mole fraction
0.091). Because this 2-oxoacid is a fragment of 2-oxoester 25a, it is clear that the oxoester functionality is absolutely necessary
for the inhibition.

Plasma Stability Studies
Determination
of the stability
of new chemical entities in plasma is important, as compounds (with
the exception of pro-drugs), which rapidly degrade in plasma, generally
show poor in vivo performance.22 The stability
of compounds 25a, 25b, and 27a in human plasma was studied in a time-dependent manner. Our aim
was to understand the difference between the two highly potent 2-oxoesters
GIVA cPLA2 inhibitors 25a and 25b in comparison to compound 27a lacking the activated
carbonyl group. A liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry
(LC-HRMS) method was developed to measure the inhibitor levels in
plasma. All of the HRMS spectra were obtained in electrospray ionization
(ESI) negative ion mode. The molecular ion of inhibitor 25b (GK484) was recorded at m/z 405.2253
(Figure 2A), whereas
in the MS/MS spectrum (Figure 2B), the most intense signal corresponds to the loss of C5H8O2 (−100.0524), indicating
the fragmentation of the ester bond. The HRMS spectra of inhibitors 25a and 27a are shown in the Supporting Information. In all cases of 2-oxoester inhibitors,
the fragmentation of the ester bond was observed. Plasma samples incubated
with each inhibitor were taken at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min and the molecular
ion of each inhibitor was used to estimate the inhibitor level. The
stability results are presented in Figure 2C as percent parent compound remaining at
each time point. Inhibitors 25a (GK504) and 25b (GK484), containing the 2-oxo group, are not detectable in the plasma
samples after 30 min, in contrast to 27a (GK505), whose
percentage remains close to 100% after 1 h. Apparently, the activated
carbonyl group of the 2-oxoester functionality of inhibitors 25a and 25b increases the chemical reactivity
of the ester bond toward hydrolysis in comparison to the less active
simple ester bond of inhibitor 27a. These results indicate
that the activated carbonyl group, which is essential for the enzyme
inhibition, makes the compounds susceptible to rapid degradation in
human plasma. A compound like 27a, lacking the activated
carbonyl group, is rather stable in plasma, however lacking the inhibitory
properties.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, a number of new 2-oxoesters and analogues were synthesized.
GK484 is the most potent inhibitor of GIVA cPLA2 ever reported
with a XI(50) value of 0.000019. The study
of the in vitro inhibitory activity highlighted the importance of
the 2-oxoester group for the inhibitory potency against GIVA cPLA2. The stability studies of 2-oxoesters in human plasma indicate
that a fine-tuning between the reactivity of the carbonyl group and
its stability will be needed in order for 2-oxoesters to be used in
vivo as pharmacological agents.

Protecting Group
A solution of tert-butyl
esters 24a–d, 26a,b (1
mmol) in CH2Cl2 (5 mL), and trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) (5 mL) was stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The organic
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and then toluene (5
mL) was added and re-evaporated twice. The product was purified by
precipitation with a mixture of EtOAc and petroleum ether (bp 40–60
°C) (5:95, v/v) or by column chromatography (CH2Cl2–MeOH, 95:5).

In Vitro PLA2 Activity Assays
Group-specific
mixed micelle modified Dole assays were employed to determine the
activity of human recombinant GIVA cPLA2, GVIA iPLA2, and GV sPLA2.18−20 To achieve optimum activity,
the substrate was prepared using slightly different conditions for
each enzyme: (i) GIVA cPLA2 mixed micelle substrate consisted
of 400 μM Triton X-100, 95.3 μM PAPC, 1.7 μM arachidonyl-1-14C PAPC, and 3 μM PIP2 in a buffer containing
100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.5, 90 μM CaCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin;
(ii) GVIA iPLA2 mixed micelle substrate consisted of 400
μM Triton X-100, 98.3 μM PAPC, and 1.7 μM arachidonyl-1-14C PAPC in a buffer containing 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 2 mM adenosine
5′-triphosphate, and 4 mM DTT; and (iii) GV sPLA2 mixed micelles substrate consisted of 400 μM Triton X-100,
98.3 μM PAPC, and 1.7 μM arachidonyl-1-14C
PAPC in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, and 5 mM
CaCl2. Initially, the compounds were screened at 0.091
mol fraction (5 μL of 5 mM inhibitor in dimethyl sulfoxide)
in substrate (495 μL). XI(50) values
were determined for compounds exhibiting more than 95% inhibition.
Inhibition curves were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.0 and the
nonlinear regression by plotting percentage of inhibition vs log (mole
fraction) to calculate the reported XI(50) and its associated error.

Plasma Stability Studies
The reactions were initiated
by the addition of test compound to 200 μL of preheated (37
°C) human plasma to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Samples
(50 μL) were taken at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min and acetonitrile
(200 μL) was added. The samples were subjected to vortex mixing
and then centrifugation for 5 min. The clear supernatants were analyzed
by LC-HRMS/MS using an AB Sciex 4600 Triple TOF combined with a micro-LC
Eksigent and an autosampler. Electrospray ionization (ESI)—negative
mode—was used for the MS experiments. Halo C18 2.7 μm,
90 Å, 0.5 × 50 mm2 from Eksigent was used as
a column and the mobile phase consisted of a gradient (A: acetonitrile/0.01%
formic acid—isopropanol 80/20 v/v; B: H2O/0.01%
formic acid). The data acquisition was carried out with MultiQuant
from AB SCIEX (version 3.0). Each sample was studied in triplicate.
The plot of the percentage of the remaining compound in comparison
to the initial concentration vs time was designed.
