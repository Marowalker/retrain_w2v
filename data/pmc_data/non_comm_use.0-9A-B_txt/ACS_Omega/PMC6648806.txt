Intermetallics are atomically ordered
crystalline compounds containing
two or more main group and transition metals. In addition to their
rich crystal chemistry, intermetallics display unique properties of
interest for a variety of applications, including superconductivity,
hydrogen storage, and catalysis. Because of the presence of metals
with a wide range of reduction potentials, the controlled synthesis
of intermetallics can be difficult. Recently, soft chemical syntheses
such as the modified polyol and ship-in-a-bottle methods have helped
advance the preparation of these materials. However, phase-segregated
products and complex multistep syntheses remain common. Here, we demonstrate
the use of heterobimetallic single-source precursors for the synthesis
of 10–15 and 11–15 binary intermetallics. The coordination
environment of the precursor, as well as the exact temperature used
play a critical role in determining the crystalline intermetallic
phase that is produced, highlighting the potential versatility of
this approach in the synthesis
of a variety of compounds. Furthermore, we show that a recently developed
novel plasma-processing technique is successful in removing the surface
graphitic carbon observed in some of the prepared compounds. This
new single-source precursor approach is a powerful addition to the
synthesis of atomically ordered intermetallic compounds and will help
facilitate their further study and development for future applications.

Introduction
Atomically ordered
intermetallics are stoichiometric crystalline
compounds in which main group and transition metals together adopt
a unique structure that differs from that of its constituent elements.
In addition to their rich and diverse structural chemistry, intermetallic
compounds display important properties of interest for magnetism,
superconductivity, catalysis, hydrogen storage, and shape-memory applications.1−8 Often grown as single crystals, intermetallic compounds are typically
made from the elements by traditional solid-state synthesis at relatively
high temperatures—normally exceeding 1000 °C. As a result,
it can be challenging to study their formation, measure their properties,
or assess their practical utilization.

Recently, progress was
made in the synthesis of intermetallic compounds
by mild “soft” chemistry methods (Scheme 1).9,10 One approach involves
dissolving separate metal salts in tetraethylene glycol, which acts
as a mild reducing agent under relatively modest temperatures.11−19 This “modified polyol synthesis” method can be limited
due to the different reduction potentials of the separate metal ions,
leading in some cases to phase-segregated products rather than to
the desired intermetallic compound. Very recently, a new templated
approach was developed to overcome this problem.20 Termed the “ship-in-a-bottle” method, it
involves growing a porous oxide shell on a metal particle, followed
by the addition of a second metal salt; the latter is able to permeate
the porous shell and react with the original metal core, resulting
in an encapsulated version of the intermetallic compound. Limitations
include the multiple steps required to grow (and, if necessary, later
remove) the porous oxide shell.

Single-source precursors–molecular complexes that
contain
all of the necessary elements required to make an inorganic material—were
originally developed for the chemical vapor deposition of thin films.21−25 Later, single-source precursors were successfully applied to the
solution phase synthesis of colloidal nanomaterials.25−29 Because of the presence of very different metals with dissimilar
electronegativities and disparate reduction potentials, complex intermetallics
are an ideal target for single-source precursors (SSPs). In this paper,
we demonstrate the general synthetic utility of heterobimetallic single-source
molecular precursors in the preparation of a wide range of binary
10–15 and 11–15 intermetallic compounds.

Results and Discussion
Precursor
Screening
A quick search in the Cambridge
Structural Database30 (CSD) is a great
way to find well-characterized molecular compounds comprised of specific
multiple elements (Scheme 2). Hits from the initial CCSD search can then be easily grouped
into families of compounds supported by common or closely related
ligands; they can also be narrowed down according to the desirable
structural and bonding features, such as the presence of heterometal–metal
interactions. A case in point is the family of heterobimetallic compounds
shown in Scheme 3,
all of which are supported by the same multidentate phosphine scaffold
and contain a group 10 or 11 metal directly bonded to a group 15 element.31−35 The presence of a common ligand platform allows for systematic synthetic
variation by changing the identity of the metals or group substitution—of
the R groups on the terminal phosphine or of the X ligands. In addition,
the presence of a pre-existing, heterometal–metal bond bodes
well for the use of these complexes as SSPs to the synthesis of atomically
ordered intermetallics.

thermolysis
Establishing Scope and
Tunability
Thermolysis of seven
representative heterobimetallic complexes with varying transition-metal
(Ni, Pd, Pt, or Au), pnictogen (As, Sb, or Bi), and ancillary ligand
combinations demonstrates the utility of this platform in accessing
several crystalline intermetallic compounds (Figure 1). Reflecting their original stoichiometry,
thermolysis of several of the precursors produces “one-to-one”
(1:1) binaries (NiAs, NiSb, PdSb, PtSb) that are known to adopt a
common NiAs structure type (hexagonal, P63/mmc) (Table 1). In cases where the relevant phase diagram lacks any known
one-to-one phases,36 thermolysis produces
other stoichiometries such as Pd2As (hexagonal, P62m) and Au2Bi (cubic, Fd3̅m). Interestingly,
thermolysis of the cationic precursor [(CyNC)Pd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2][SbF6] produces PdSb, whereas thermolysis of the
neutral analog ClPd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2 produces Pd20Sb7 (trigonal, R3̅, Figure 1d vs 1e, respectively). These divergent results strongly suggest that the
specific ligand scaffold and metal coordination environment of the
precursor precisely determine its mechanism and rate of decomposition,
raising the prospect of fine tuning the outcome of thermolysis by
group substitution or “molecular programming.”37−43

Single Source versus Separate
Precursors
Control experiments
with separate commercially available precursors, thoroughly mixed
and heated under the same conditions used to thermolyze the heterobimetallic
complexes attest to the superiority of the latter. For example, NiCl2 and Ph3Sb fail to react with one another, whereas
Ni(COD)2 and Ph3Sb do so uncontrollably, producing
a mixture of NiSb and Ni5Sb2 (Figure 2). Therefore, thermolysis of
ClNi(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3SbCl and other SSPs is a more reliable and generalizable
approach to the preparation of binary intermetallics.

solids obtained after thermolysis of separate
vs SSPs (600 °C).

Precursor Decomposition and Phase Evolution
An added
feature of the heterobimetallic SSPs presented here is their ability
to produce different intermetallic compounds when heated to different
temperatures. For example, thermolysis of ClPt(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3SbCl at 340, 450,
or 600 °C produces phase-pure PtSb, a mixture of PtSb and Pt,
or only Pt metal, respectively. Similarly, thermolysis of [ClPd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3As]Cl at 475 or 600° C produces either phase-pure Pd2As or a mixture of Pd2As and PdAs2, respectively.
Finally, thermolysis of ClPd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2 at 380, 450, or
600 °C produces phase-pure Pd8Sb3, phase-pure
Pd20Sb7, or a mixture of PdSb and Pd8Sb3, respectively—see the Supporting Information.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) coupled to online MS and IR analysis of
evolved gases provide additional clues about the mechanism of thermal
decomposition of SSPs (Figure 3). The two most common decomposition products are phenylchloride
(PhCl) and triphenylphosphine (PPh3) (Table 1 and Supporting Information). These are confirmed IR peaks corresponding to
C(Ar)–H stretches slightly above 3000 cm–1 and C(Ar)–P stretches at 1100 and 1400 cm–1. In the case of ClAu(o-iPr2P-C6H4)2BiCl, where R = iPr rather than phenyl
(Scheme 3), MS and
IR spectra are consistent with the evolution of di-iso-propylphenylphosphine
(iPr2PPh) instead of Ph3P. A majority of heterobimetallic
complexes start to decompose between 270 and 340 °C, with the
exception of [(CyNC)Pd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2][SbF6], which
starts to decompose at only 173 °C. In this case, MS and IR show
that this is accompanied by loss of cyclohexene (C6H10) from fragmentation of the cyclohexylisocyanide (CNCy) ligand.
Therefore, a change in the nature of the monodentate ligand from phosphine
to isocyanide can have a significant effect in lowering the temperature
of thermolysis.

spectrum
(410 °C) and (c) IR of gases evolved during its decomposition
from 45 to 600 °C.

Interestingly, the difference between the total mass left
after
thermolysis, as measured by TGA, and the theoretical total inorganic
mass, calculated only from the content of group 10 or 11 transition-metal
(M) and group 15 (Pn) elements, points to the presence of some leftover
organics in a few of the intermetallic products (Table 1). Because only crystalline
inorganic compounds are observed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), we conclude
that these residues must be made of either an amorphous or semicrystalline
material. Interestingly, despite thermolysis occurring in the absence
of additional solvents or surfactants, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) shows that the intermetallic products are made of nanocrystalline
particles (Figure 4 and Supporting Information).

of ClPt(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3SbCl at 340 °C. Observed lattice fringes with d-spacings of 2.02 and 2.99 Å correspond to (−120)
and (011) lattice planes of PtSb.

Fate and Removal of Carbon
To probe the nature of the
excess mass observed after thermolysis, we used Raman spectroscopy
(Figure 5). A Raman
peak observed at about 1340 cm–1 corresponds to
disordered and structural defects within the graphitic sp2 carbons (known as the D or A1g band), whereas another
at 1570 cm–1 corresponds to the doubly degenerate
in-plane sp2 C–C stretching mode (known as the G
or E2g band). A third Raman peak around 2680 cm–1, indicative of layered graphene (a D-band overtone known as the
2D band) is absent from our samples. On the basis of this information,
we conclude that the residual organics observed in some of the intermetallic
compounds prepared here is mostly made of graphitic carbon.44−46 Critically, there is a good correlation between the amount of excess
mass measured by TGA and the relative intensity of the graphitic peaks,
as observed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 5a).

containing negligible
(PdSb, 2%) vs noticeable (Pd2As, 24%) residual mass upon

an O2 plasma.

The presence of associated graphitic carbon could be advantageous
in some applications such as catalysis or electrochemistry.47,48 However, it can sometimes slow down the further development of materials
for other applications. Therefore, we sought to remove this impurity
from the surface of the intermetallic compounds. To do this, we employed
plasma cleaning or “processing”, which was recently
shown to be superior to calcination in the removal of organic ligands
and other carbonaceous materials from the surface of nanocrystal assemblies,
without negatively impacting their structure. Typically, the gases
employed are O2 or He. Both have been shown to effectively
remove carbon from the surface of various nanoparticles without detrimentally
affecting their properties.49−53 Using Pd2As under an O2 plasma as an example,
we find that the graphitic peak intensities greatly decrease after
24 h and mostly disappear after 72 h of plasma processing (see Figure 5b and Experimental Section). To avoid the risk of oxidation, He
plasma could be employed too, but carbon removal was slower in this
case.

Conclusions
Atomically ordered intermetallics, often
grown as single crystals
at relatively high temperatures, were recently made by milder soft
chemistry methods. However, phase segregation or multistep reactions
remain common challenges. A search in the CCSD allowed us to identify
a family of heterobimetallic complexes containing the desirable SSP
features, such as the presence of a common and flexible ligand platform
and the presence of a pre-existing heterometal–metal bond.

Thermolysis of these heterobimetallic precursors consistently produces
crystalline binary phases containing both metals, confirming our hypothesis
that these complexes are ideal single-source precursors to atomically
ordered intermetallics. Control studies demonstrate that SSPs are
superior to separate precursors in producing the desired intermetallic
products under otherwise identical reaction conditions. The specific
ligand coordination environment affects the specific product phase,
suggesting that the mechanism and rate of decomposition can be tuned
by group substitution or “molecular programming.” Additionally,
heating the precursors to different temperatures also affects the
specific product phase, providing more opportunities for tunability.

TGA–DSC coupled with evolved gas analysis by MS–IR
are powerful tools to investigate the mechanism of thermal decomposition
of heterobimetallic precursors. Through Raman analysis, we were able
to determine that the excess mass leftover after thermolysis of some
of these precursors is made of a thin layer of graphitic carbon on
the intermetallic surface. Conveniently, this carbonaceous residue
can be removed through plasma processing without negatively impacting
the structure of the intermetallic compound. This new single-source
precursor approach is a powerful addition to the synthesis of binary
intermetallics and will help speed up their study and development
for future applications.

[(CyNC)Pd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2][SbF6] and [ClPd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3As]Cl are synthesized as follows. NiCl2 (anhydrous, 98%),
bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel (0) (Ni(COD)2, 98+%), Ph3Sb (97%), cyclohexyl isocyanide (CyNC, 98%), and AgSbF6 (99%) were purchased from Strem and used as received. CH2Cl2, Et2O, and tetrahydrofuran (THF)
were purchased from Fisher Chemical, and celite was purchased from
MilliporeSigma. CD2Cl2 and CDCl3 were
purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs and used as received. CH2Cl2 was dried over alumina using a column-based
solvent purification system from MBraun. Et2O and THF were
refluxed under N2 over Na/K and distilled prior to use.
All precursor syntheses were carried out in air.

Synthesis
[(CyNC)Pd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl2][SbF6]
(o-Ph2P-C6H4)2SbCl (34
mg, 0.05 mmol) was mixed with PdCl2(COD) (14 mg, 0.05 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 (4 mL). After 2 h, cyclohexyl isocyanide
(8 μL, 0.06 mmol) and AgSbF6 (17 mg; 0.05 mmol) were
sequentially added, and stirring continued for 16 h. The mixture was
evacuated to dryness and the residue washed with Et2O,
taken up in CH2Cl2 (2 mL), and filtered through
celite. Solvent evaporation afforded a yellow solid (33 mg, yield:
56%). Single crystals suitable for XRD were obtained by slow diffusion
of Et2O into a CH2Cl2 solution at
ambient temperature (21 °C or RT). 1H NMR (499.42
MHz; CD2Cl2): δ 8.33 (d, 2H, 3JH–H = 7.7 Hz), 7.95 (dd, 2H, 3JH–H = 10.7 Hz, 3JH–H = 4.3 Hz), 7.72 (dd, 2H, 3JH–H = 10.7 Hz, 3JH–H = 4.3 Hz), 7.66–7.54

[ClPd(o-Ph2P-C6H4)3As]Cl
A
solution of PdCl2(COD) (70 mg, 0.25 mmol)
in CH2Cl2 (3 mL) was added dropwise to a stirred
suspension of (o-Ph2P-C6H4)3As (212 mg, 0.25 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (ca. 5 mL) Stirring for 12 h gave a red suspension. The mixture
was filtered, washed with THF (2 mL), and dried in vacuo to afford
a dark red powder (55 mg, yield: 78%). Single crystals suitable for
XRD were obtained by slow diffusion of Et2O into a chloroform
solution at RT. 1H NMR (499.42 MHz; CDCl3):
δ 8.33 (d, 3H, 3JH–H = 8.0 Hz), 8.17 (t, 3H, 3JH–H = 7.6 Hz), 7.65 (d, 3H, 3JH–H = 7.3 Hz), 7.42 (d, 3H, 3JH–H = 7.7 Hz), 7.22 (dd, 6H, 3JH–H = 8.0 Hz, 3JH–H =
7.2 Hz), 7.13–7.05 (m, 12H), and 7.02 (dd, 12H, 3JH–H = 7.5 Hz, 3JH–H = 7.3 Hz). 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz; CDCl3): δ 135.5 (s), 135.3 (s),
134.6 (br s), 132.9 (s), 132.4(s), 130.3 (s), and 128.8 (s). 31P{1H} NMR (202.16 MHz; CDCl3): δ

Thermolysis
Single Source Precursors
TGA and DSC were carried out
on a Netzsch DSC/TGA (STA449 F1) coupled with a mass spectrometer
and an infrared spectrophotometer for the analysis of evolved gases.
The heterobimetallic precursor (5–20 mg) was placed in an alumina
crucible, inserted into the TGA–DSC furnace, and placed under
an inert Ar atmosphere. The temperature was increased from 45 to 600
°C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Mass spectra from 10 to 300 amu
and FT-IR spectra of the evolved gases were measured at a rate of
10 scans per min. After cooling to RT, the remaining solids were removed
and analyzed by powder XRD.

Separate Precursors54
Equimolar
amounts (0.1 mmol each) of Ni (NiCl2, 16 mg or Ni(COD)2, 21 mg) and Ph3Sb (35 mg) were ground together
in a mortar with a pestle. The mixture was transferred to an alumina
crucible, placed in a tube furnace, purged with N2 gas
for 30 min, and heated from 21 to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
under continuous N2 flow. After cooling to RT, the remaining
solids were removed and analyzed by powder XRD.

Plasma Processing
Samples deposited on a glass slide
were exposed to low temperature plasma using a Harrick’s etcher
(PDC-001) with PlasmaFlo gas mixer, O2 as the feed gas,
and 30 W power at 500 mTorr.49−53

Structural Characterization
Single Crystal XRD
Single crystal
XRD measurements
were performed at 110(2) K using a Bruker APEX-II CCD area detector
diffractometer (Mo Kα radiation, λ = 0.71069 Å).
In each case, a specimen of suitable size and quality was selected
and mounted onto a nylon loop. The structures were solved by direct
methods, which successfully located most of the nonhydrogen atoms.
Semi-empirical absorption corrections were applied. Subsequent refinement
on F2 using the SHELXTL/PC package (v.
6.1) allowed location of the remaining nonhydrogen atoms.

Powder XRD
Powder XRD was collected using a Cu Kα
radiation source on a Rigaku Ultima IV (40 kV, 44 mA) diffractometer.
Each sample was prepared by drop-casting hexane suspensions onto a
background-less quartz slide.

Spectroscopy
NMR
NMR spectroscopy was recorded at RT on a Varian
Unity Inova 500 FT NMR (499.42 MHz for 1H, 125.58 MHz for 13C, 202.16 MHz for 31P), Inova 400 FT NMR (100
MHz for 13C), and an Inova 300 FT NMR (121.49 MHz for 31P). 1H and 13C{1H} NMR chemical
shifts are given in ppm and referenced against SiMe4 using
residual solvent signals as secondary standards. 31P{1H} NMR chemical shifts are given in ppm and referenced against
H3PO4 as an external standard.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy analyses were
performed using an XploRa Plus confocal Raman upright microscope,
equipped with a Synapse EMCCD camera (Horiba Scientific/NJ, France).
Diode lasers (532 and 785 nm) were used at 0.3 and 0.9 mW power, respectively.
The 532 nm excitation laser was used for the analysis of PtSb, NiSb,
Pd2As, PdSb, and Au2Bi samples, whereas the
785 nm excitation laser was used for the NiAs sample. A 50× air
objective (Olympus, LMPlanFL) with a 0.5 numerical aperture was used
to collect the Raman signal at five different locations on the sample
with a 30 s acquisition time and 2 accumulations. Reported spectra
were recorded with a 600 grooves/mm grating.
