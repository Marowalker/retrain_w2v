In
the sea urchin embryo spicule, there exists a proteome of >200
proteins that are responsible for controlling the mineralization of
the spicule and the formation of a fracture-resistant composite. In
this report, using recombinant proteins, we identify that two protein
components of the spicule, SM30B/C and SM50, are hydrogelators. Because
of the presence of intrinsic disorder and aggregation-prone regions,
these proteins assemble to form porous mesoscale hydrogel particles
in solution. These hydrogel particles change their size, organization,
and internal structure in response to pH and ions, particularly Ca(II),
which indicates that these behave as ion-responsive or “smart”
hydrogels. Using diffusion-ordered spectroscopy NMR, we find that
both hydrogels affect the diffusion of water, but only SM50 affects
the diffusion of an anionic solute. Thus, the extracellular matrix
of the spicule consists of several hydrogelator proteins which are
responsive to solution conditions and can control the diffusion of
water and solutes, and these proteins will serve as a model system
for designing ion-responsive, composite, and smart hydrogels.

Introduction
Rapid developments
have occurred in hydrogel technology, spanning
such applications as drug delivery, adhesion, nanoparticle organization,
cell culture, and so on.1−6 Hydrogels are essentially highly hydrated polymer networks possessing
bonding or nonbonding interchain interactions. Hydrogel properties,
such as diffusion, internal transport, and mechanical strength, are
directly linked to the degree of swelling and the chemistries offered
by the polymer network itself.1−7 At present, there are two areas of hydrogel research that have garnered
attention. The first is “smart” hydrogel technology
involving the creation of polymer networks capable of responding to
multiple environmental triggers, such as pH or temperature.1,2,4,6,7 The second is “composite”
hydrogels, where small inorganic particles become incorporated into
the gel network and enhance the mechanical properties of the gel phase.3,5 If we can gain further insights into engineering improvements in
these areas, then the hydrogel technology and its corresponding applications
will advance more rapidly.

Notably, our ability to jumpstart
existing technologies can be
enhanced by the study of organisms in nature. Although synthetic polymer
networks are commonly used for hydrogel generation,1−7 there are natural polymeric systems that also lend themselves to
hydrogel formation, such as collagen, chitosan, fibrin, agarose, hyaluronic
acid, and cellulose.2 Interestingly, there
are some extracellular matrices (ECMs) in nature that may offer bioinspired
insights into hydrogel technologies. One of these is sea urchin skeletal
elements: protective embryonic spicules and adult spines, where ECM
proteins combine to form an environment for inorganic nanoparticle
nucleation (calcium carbonates), assembly, and the creation of a fracture-resistant
inorganic–organic composite.8−11 This protein system may play
an important role in creating a meshwork within the ECM that limits
ion diffusion and creates ultrasmall volume compartmentalization that
controls the mineral nucleation process.8−11

There are more than 200
different proteins8−18 that comprise the embryonic spicule matrix, and several proteins
have been identified as regulators of the spicule mineralization process.8−18 Many of these proteins have very interesting properties, such as
the presence of intrinsic disorder or unfolded structure and amyloid-like
cross-beta strand aggregation-prone sequences, both of which promote
protein–protein aggregation and assembly.17,18 This assembly process creates supramolecular complexes or protein
aggregates that are hydrogel-like in appearance17,18 and possess a particle and filmlike character on surfaces. These
protein hydrogels have been demonstrated to control early stages of
mineralization17,18 and to modify the surfaces and
interiors of existing crystals.17,18 However, the physical
nature of these protein hydrogels has not been fully explored: do
these smart hydrogels respond to environmental changes, and if so,
do they possess any interesting properties that might advance our
understanding and development of synthetic hydrogels?

In this
article, we examine two intrinsically disordered, aggregation-prone
embryonic spicule matrix proteins (Figure 1): the glycoprotein SpSM30B/C [isoelectric
point (pI) = 5.73, 270 AA, molecular weight (MW) = 33 287.4
Da Strongylocentrotus purpuratus] and
SpSM50 (pI = 10.7, 428 AA, MW = 44 541 Da),8−11,17,18 of which SpSM50 is the nonglycosylated major
protein component of the spicule matrix. Both proteins are nonphosphorylated,
distinctly different in net charge, and possess intrinsically disordered
and amyloid-like cross-beta strand aggregation sequences (Figure 1).17,18 Each protein forms mesoscale protein hydrogel particles that modify
crystal growth directions,17 introduce
surface nanotexturing and subsurface porosities to growing calcium
carbonate crystals, promote faceted crystal growth, and capture and
organize mineral nanoparticles.17,18 Using a recombinant
version of both proteins (insect cell-expressed, glycosylated rSpSM30B/C-G
and bacterially expressed rSpSM50)17,18 and biophysical
techniques, we confirm that these spicule matrix proteins are in fact
smart hydrogelators: they change their size, organization, and internal
structure in response to pH, Na+, and Ca2+.
Further, using 1H PFG NMR, we confirm that both hydrogels
affect the diffusion of water protons in similar ways but react differently
to an anionic tracer molecule. Thus, the ECM of mineralized sea urchin
spicules is a protein-based hydrogel. Further, recombinant proteins
such as rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50, alongside their nacre protein hydrogelator
counterparts,19−25 can serve as models for developing smart or responsive hydrogelation
systems.

Materials and Methods
Recombinant Synthesis,
Purification, and Preparation of rSpSM30B/C-G
and rSpSM50
The gene synthesis, cloning, bacterial expression,
and purification of the insect cell-expressed recombinant glycoprotein
rSpSM30B/C-G were performed by GenScript USA (Piscataway, NJ, USA; www.genscript.com/) using their
proprietary OptimumGene system and baculovirus recombinant expression
systems as described elsewhere.17 The gene
synthesis, cloning, bacterial expression, and purification of the
recombinant rSpSM50 were performed by BiologicsCorp (Indianapolis,
IN, USA) as described elsewhere.18 For
subsequent experimentation, both samples were created by exchanging
and concentrating appropriate volumes of stock solution into 30 nm
filtered Fisher AFM-grade water (Fisher Scientific, USA) or other
appropriate buffers using Amicon Ultra 0.5, 3 kDa molecular weight
cutoff (Millipore Corporation, USA). For the studies listed in this
report, the following buffer conditions were utilized: 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH 8.0 (denoted as low ionic strength conditions); 8.9
mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0; 10 mM HEPES/30 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0; and 10 mM HEPES/10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. All buffers
were prepared in 30 nm filtered Fisher AFM water (Fisher Scientific,
USA) and filtered at 0.2 μm after pH adjustment to purge particulates.

Light Microscopy Imaging of Protein Hydrogel Particles
For
the detection of mesoscale protein hydrogel particles, 5 μL
of 50 μM rSpSM30B/C-G and 10 μM rSpSM50 solutions in the
appropriate buffer (see above) was placed on a clean glass slide with
a glass coverslip and imaged using bright field microscopy (100×
objective, Nikon DS-U3 light microscope). Note that because of the
differences in aggregation propensity and hydrogelation, higher rSpSM30B/C-G
protein concentrations were required to generate sufficiently large
hydrogels for visualization purposes.17−19,21,25

Flow Cytometry Experiments
of Protein Aggregates
The
aggregation of rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 (15 and 1.5 μM final
concentrations, respectively) was studied in the above-mentioned buffers.
Because of the strong aggregation propensities, lower concentrations
of rSpSM50 were utilized to avoid precipitation issues. Samples were
constituted and allowed to sit for 5 min prior to analysis. Aggregation
measurements were performed using a multiparameter cell analyzer CytoFLEX
(Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). Each sample solution (100 μL) was
analyzed at a continuous flow rate of 10 μL/min using four laser
excitation lines of 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm to register two light
scattering parameters (forward-scattered component or FSC-A and side-scattered
component or SSC-A; detailed definitions can be found in the legend
of Figure 3)25−28 and the number of events for each sample. Data were collected using
the CytExpert 1.2.11.0 software designed for the instrument and processed
using FlowJo software (Tree Star, OR, USA).

1H NMR PFG DOSY
Diffusion Experiments
To
measure the interactions of solvent water and a traceable charged
solute with the protein hydrogels, we performed 1H NMR
PFG experiments on the following samples (3 mm NMR tubes). A control
sample consisted of 150 μL of 30 nm Fisher UltraPure water (Fisher
Scientific, USA) containing 10% v/v 99.9% D2O (Cambridge
Scientific Labs, USA) and 133 μM 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (d4-TSP) (Cambridge Isotope Labs, USA). The rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50
samples consisted of 22 μM protein in 150 μL of 30 nm
Fisher UltraPure water with 133 μM d4-TSP. Each sample was titrated to pH 8.0 using microliter volumes
of HCl or NaOH. 1H NMR experiments were conducted at 25
°C on a Bruker AVANCE-700 NMR spectrometer using a 3 mm cryo-probehead.
Diffusion experiments for all samples were performed at a field strength
of 700 MHz using a two-dimensional (2D) diffusion-ordered spectroscopy
(DOSY) experiment29−32 for diffusion measurement using stimulated echo, LED diffusion pulse
sequence, bipolar gradient pulses, two spoil gradients, and a DOSY
linear ramp of 16 points, with delays at 10, 0.1, 0.005, and 0.0002
s. All NMR data were analyzed and plotted using TopSpin software (Bruker
BioSpin, USA).

Bioinformatics
To determine the
location of disordered
sequence regions within the SpSM30B/C-G and SpSM50 sequences, we employed
the DISOPRED333 and IUP_PRED34 prediction algorithms using default parameters.
Subsequently, we utilized TANGO,35 AGGRESCAN,36 and ZIPPER_DB37 with
default parameters to globally identify putative cross-beta strand
sequence regions which exhibit association propensities (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
rSpSM
Proteins Form Hydrogel-Like Particles That Respond to
pH and Ionic Strength Conditions
Our initial reference point
is pH 8.0, which mimics the pH utilized in our past in vitro mineralization
studies of rSpSM50 and rSPSM30B/C-G.17,18 Note that
the pH of the embryonic spicule matrix is not known at present, so
we must rely on the in vitro pH 8.0 as the mineralization standard17,18 for the time being. As shown in Figure 2, light microscopy studies confirm that both
rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 form translucent particles at pH 8.0 that
appear gel-like. These particles have irregular morphologies and appear
to be porous as evidenced by the presence of voidlike regions within
the particles. For comparison, we studied these protein particles
at 8.9 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0 and 10 mM HEPES/30
mM NaCl, pH 8.0, with both buffer conditions possessing the same ionic
strength value as 10 mM CaCl2/10 mM HEPES. As we shall
see, similarities in ionic strength values allow cross comparisons
between these conditions and latter Ca2+ studies.

Figure 2 Light microscopy

10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0; 10 mM HEPES/30 mM NaCl, pH 8.0; and 8.9 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0. Scale bars = 10 microns.

We will first consider low pH conditions (pH 4.0)
which are below
the pI of both proteins. Note that in Figure 2 there are dimensional and morphological
changes in mesoscale hydrogel particles in response to protein side-chain
protonation. For rSpSM30B/C-G, a shift to lower pH results in the
formation of larger hydrogels which consist of subassemblies, evidence
of clustering, textured surfaces, and no observable large voids or
porosities. A similar result is obtained for rSpSM50 but with a much
more significant morphological shift to a sicklelike hydrogel consisting
of multiple subassemblies. In both proteins, low pH conditions foster
the formation of smaller hydrogel particles which then coassemble
into larger hydrogels. However, slightly different results are obtained
in pH 8.0/NaCl solutions, where small hydrogel particle coassemblies
are noted for rSpSM30B/C-G but not for rSpSM50 (Figure 2). We attribute this difference to the fact
that rSpSM30B/C-G is anionic at pH 8.0 (pI = 5.73) because of the
presence of Asp, Glu, and sulfated/carboxylated oligosaccharide chains.17 Thus, this protein would be more susceptible
to electrostatic shielding or neutralization from Na+ and
Cl– than rSpSM50 (pI = 10.7), which is cationic
in nature because of the presence of 25 Arg groups.18 This electrostatic susceptibility, in turn, would lead
to NaCl-induced changes in hydrogel particle aggregation for anionic
rSpSM30B/C-G but not for cationic rSpSM50.17,18

rSpSM Hydrogel Particles in Flow Exhibit Particle Size and Internal
Granularity Changes in Response to pH and Ionic Strength
To confirm the external and internal changes that occur with mesoscale
rSpSM hydrogel particles as a function of buffer conditions, we applied
a technique, flow cytometry, typically used for analyzing transparent
micron-sized cell populations25−28 to map physical changes in translucent mesoscale
protein particles under buffer conditions that are parallel to our
light microscopy studies (Figure 3). There are two light scattering
parameters that one can monitor for particles under constant flow:
(1) FSC (x-axis) to determine particle size distribution
and (2) SSC (y-axis) to measure refracted and reflected
light that occurs at any interface within the particles where there
is a change in refractive index (RI) that results from variations
in particle granularity or internal structure.25−28 Note that our flow cytometry
experiments do not provide exact particle size data but only the distributions
of particle sizes.

Figure 3 Flow cytometry 2D density plots (FSC vs SSC) of 15 μM
rSpSM30B/C-G
and 1.5 μM rSpSM50 proteins in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0; 10 mM HEPES/30
mM NaCl, pH 8.0; and 8.9 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0.
FSC refers to a parameter measuring light scattered less than 10°
as a particle passes through the laser beam and is related to the
particle size. SSC is proportional to particle granularity or internal
complexity and is a measurement of mostly refracted and reflected
light that occurs at any interface within the particle where there
is a change in RI. SSC is collected at approximately 90° to the
laser beam by a collection lens and then redirected by a beam splitter
to the appropriate detector.

As we observe in Figure 3, low ionic strength conditions at pH 8.0 generate
a distribution
of hydrogel particle sizes and internal structure or granularities
for both proteins, with the evidence of ∼20 different populations
for rSpSM30B/C-G and a single, heterogeneous population for rSpSM50.
When the transition drops to pH 4.0, the size distributions and the
internal structure shift to smaller values for both the proteins,
with the number of distinct rSpSM30B/C-G hydrogel particle populations
decreasing by 50%. This suggests that the protonation of anionic groups,
particularly in rSpSM30B/C-G, leads to changes in the aggregate structure
and dimension, which we observed in the light microscope (Figure 2). To some extent
the same phenomenon is observed in the presence of NaCl (Figure 3), where relative
to low ionic strength conditions at pH 8.0 we see a decrease in both
FSC and SSC parameters, indicating that ion pairing of Na+ and Cl– ions with anionic and cationic charged
groups, respectively, on both proteins leads to dimensional and internal
structural changes, again in agreement with our light microscopy data
(Figure 2).

Response
of rSpSM Hydrogels to Ca2+
To determine
how rSpSM hydrogel particles would respond to a mineralization-like
environment,17,18 we next compared the morphology,
particle size distribution, and particle granularity of each rSpSM
protein hydrogel particle in the presence and absence of 10 mM CaCl2 at pH 8.0 in 10 mM HEPES (Figure 4), which mimics the conditions utilized in
previous in vitro mineralization assays.17,18 An examination of the light microscopy images of both proteins reveals
an increase in hydrogel particle size. Further, in the case of rSpSM30B/C-G,
the hydrogels appear to consist of multiple hydrogel subunit particles,
as we witnessed in the pH 4.0 and pH 8.0/NaCl scenarios (Figure 2). However, in the
case of rSpSM50, we observe a different effect of Ca2+ on
hydrogel particle morphology: the presence of exterior blebs, which
may be indicative of a continuing assembly process involving smaller
hydrogel subunits (Figure 4). These results are supported by our flow cytometry dataset,
which show that both proteins experience an increase in particle size
distributions in the presence of Ca(II) (i.e., increase in the FSC-A
component, Figure 4). Interestingly, the particle granularity or the internal structure
of the hydrogel particles appears to decrease in the presence of Ca(II),
which may reflect changes due to the particle composition (e.g., shift
to multiple subunit components and interfaces and changes in the internal
porosities). Again, as described for the pH 4.0 and NaCl conditions,
these changes reflect charge-shielding effects that protons, counterions,
and Ca(II) ions exert on both protein hydrogels. Overall (Figures 2–4), we conclude that the recombinant spicule matrix
proteins rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 are hydrogelators that form smart
ion-responsive mesoscale gel particles in solution, like what we have
noted for mollusk shell nacre proteins.21,25

rSpSM30B/C-G and 1.5 μM rSpSM50 in the presence and absence
of 10 mM CaCl2 in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0.

rSpSM Hydrogel Particles Affect Tracer and Water Diffusion
In earlier studies, we determined that rSpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50
affected the kinetics of prenucleation clusters (PNCs), an early intermediate
that assembles to form amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC).17,18 ACC is an important intermediate in spiculogenesis and eventually
transforms into a single-crystal calcite.12−14 Interestingly,
we found that rSpSM30B/C-G stabilized ACC, whereas rSpSM50 destabilized
ACC in vitro. Hypothetically, protein hydrogels could contribute to
these phenomena via changes in ion cluster associations and ion kinetics,
either via surface or internal interactions with cations and anions
or mediating the release of water from the clusters.37,38 Moreover, both protein hydrogels are noted to possess mineral nanoparticles
within their matrices,17,18 which suggest that the hydrated
ionic clusters appear within the hydrogels during the nucleation process.

Thus, to explain these in vitro phenomena, we need to determine
whether rSpSM hydrogel particles are solvent- and solute-interactive.
To achieve this, we applied 1H 2D PFG diffusion experiments
(DOSY)29−32 to probe the effect of both protein hydrogel particles on bulk water
protons (Table 1; Figure
S1, Supporting Information) and on a small,
traceable anionic solute, d4-TSP, which
serves both as a carbonate/bicarbonate surrogate and a 1H chemical shift reference (Figure 5). In the DOSY experiment, water and TSP molecules
become spatially labeled based on their position in the NMR tube.
If these molecules move after the encoding, or “labeling”,
period during the diffusion time (Δ) that follows in the pulse
sequence, then their new position can be decoded with a second gradient
(F1 axis) and a temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient can be
calculated.29−32 Thus, any TSP or water molecules which interact with either hydrogel
particle ensemble should exhibit a noticeable change in their diffusion
coefficients relative to species in the bulk state (i.e., in the absence
of protein). Three caveats should be mentioned: (1) We presume that
the large, denser hydrogel particles (Figures 3 and 4) have settled
out to the bottom of the tube during the NMR experiments; however,
there may be some population of hydrogel particles whose sizes and
densities allow them to remain suspended in the solution rather than
settle out. Unfortunately, for either protein, we do not know the
percentage of hydrogel particles that are suspended or settled out
in solution, and thus, we assume that the dataset reflects both hydrogel
states and their averaged effects on TSP diffusion. (2) We assume
that the interactions of the hydrogels with TSP and water reflect
an averaging of internal and external hydrogel surface interactions
with either species, in which unfortunately our NMR experiments are
unable to resolve as separate phenomena. (3) Because DOSY experiments
are optimized for isotropic species,29−32 any species that is bound tightly
to hydrogel particles becomes anisotropic and thus cannot be detected
by these experiments because of their inhomogeneous broadening effects.
Thus, the DOSY experiments primarily measure the effect of each hydrogel
on the diffusion of bulk solution species.

on the y-axis (F1 domain) and determined from the
contour plot maxima for each sample.

Using parallel protein-free
and protein-containing samples, we
detected nearly identical perturbations of bulk water diffusion by
both proteins relative to the bulk protein-free state at 25 °C
(Table 1; Supporting Information, Figure S1): an increase
in water proton diffusion by a factor of ∼7×. It is known
that hydrogels attract water avidly,1−7,37,38 and our DOSY results indicate that both protein hydrogels attract
or exchange protons with the bulk water phase over the course of the
NMR experiment to a similar degree, thus increasing the observed water
diffusion during this period. By contrast, different results were
obtained for TSP (Figure 5, Table 1),
which exists in a molar ratio of 6:1 relative to each protein. Here,
the diffusion coefficients for TSP in the presence and absence of
rSpSM30B/C are nearly identical, suggesting that the diffusion of
the tracer is only minimally affected by this protein hydrogel. However,
for rSpSM50, the diffusion of the TSP molecule is reduced by nearly
a factor of 2 relative to the bulk state and to rSpSM30B/C-G. We attribute
these differences in TSP diffusion to the fact that rSpSM30B/C-G is
anionic and may be repulsive to the TSP sulfonate. Conversely, rSpSM50
has a pI of 10.7 and 25 Arg residues,18 and thus, the cationic nature of this protein may attract the anionic
TSP molecule to the hydrogel and thus restrict the diffusion of this
tracer in bulk solution. Thus, rSpSM hydrogels affect the diffusion
of bulk water in a similar fashion but differ in terms of the diffusion
of the anionic tracer. This may help to explain why each protein affects
the water- and ion-dependent ACC stabilization process37,38 in different ways.

In summary, our study verifies that the
recombinant versions of S. purpuratus sea urchin spicule matrix proteins
SM50 and SM30B/C are hydrogelators (Figures 2–4), that is,
both proteins form porous hydrogel particles in solution. Note that
it remains to be seen whether hydrogelation also takes place in situ
with the native versions of each protein, which may contain post-translational
modifications yet to be discovered (e.g., phosphorylation).10 The ability of both recombinant proteins to
form hydrogels lies in two common sequence traits (Figure 1):17,18 (a) intrinsic disorder, where the lack of folded structure introduces
conformational instability and thus protein molecules become interactive
with one another (i.e., aggregation) to achieve internal stabilization;17,18,32,33 and (b) amyloid-like cross-beta strand aggregation domains, which
also induce protein–protein aggregation.17,18,34−36 We note that other invertebrate
skeletal systems, specifically the mollusk nacre layer, also possess
hydrogelator proteins with qualitatively similar sequence traits.21−25 This suggests that protein disorder and aggregation propensities
play an important role in the protein hydrogel-mediated biomineralization
process within sea urchins and mollusks.

The discovery of porous
spicule matrix protein hydrogels represents
a step forward in our understanding of the biomineralization process
in the sea urchin spicule. As summarized elsewhere,1−7,21,25 porous hydrogels provide several key features for the nucleation
process and crystal assembly: volume confinement, compartmentalization,
nanoparticle assembly, and organization. Given that SpSM50 and SpSM30
are among the most abundant proteins in the spicule matrix during
spiculogenesis,9−11,15,16 we would argue that the spicule matrix possesses a hydrogel environment
within which nucleation, nanoparticle assembly, ACC formation, and
ACC-to-calcite transformation take place. We note that the mollusk
shell nacre layer also possesses a protein-based hydrogel environment,19−25 and thus, both mineralized skeletal tissues may use similar molecular
strategies in constructing fracture-resistant biocomposites.

The intriguing response of the protein hydrogel particles to different
ionic conditions (Figures 2–4) indicates that the rSpSM
protein hydrogel particles are ion-responsive or smart,1−7 that is, their morphologies, particle size distributions, and internal
structures respond to changes in protonation or ions. Perhaps the
most dramatic changes were noted at low pH, particularly for rSpSM50
hydrogels, where a multi-subunit extended morphology formed (Figure 2). This suggests
that Asp, Glu, and carboxylate side chains (and in the case of rSpSM30B/C-G,
sulfated, carboxylated oligosaccharide chains) play an important role
in SpSM hydrogelation under different conditions. We believe that
ion responsiveness may serve as a “trigger”1−7 for hydrogel participation in CaCO3 nucleation events,
that is, hydrogels change size, morphology, and internal structure
in response to Ca(II) ions (Figure 4), which in turn can affect the assembly and organization
of mineral nanoparticles,17,18 an important event
in the crystallization by the particle attachment41,42 mechanism that ultimately leads to a single-crystal calcite formation
in the forming spicule.12

Our study
also sheds light on the ability of biomineral-associated
protein hydrogels to interact with bulk water and charged solutes
(Figure 5, Table 1; Figure S1, Supporting Information). Here, both hydrogels
increase the diffusion of water protons over time, but only cationic
rSpSM50 exhibits perturbation of anionic TSP diffusion over time.
Recent studies revealed that hydration of ion clusters and ACC is
highly important to the calcium carbonate mineralization process,
in that water network dynamics play a role in phase separation during
nucleation.39 Further, ion clustering involves
water release from the ion hydration layers and is believed to accompany
PNC formation during nucleation.40 Thus,
protein hydrogels could play an important role in these processes
by mediating water release or diffusion from ion clusters.39,40,43−46 Further, the anionic and cationic
nature of SpSM30B/C-G and rSpSM50 hydrogels, respectively, may differentially
influence the movement and availability of hydrated ionic species
(Figure 5) such as
carbonate, bicarbonate, and PNCs43−46 during nucleation and may be
the basis for why each protein affects ACC stabilization in different
ways.17,18 Obviously, additional experimentation will
be required to determine how each protein hydrogel affects ion cluster
mobility, hydration, and assembly to further establish this possibility.

Finally, what insights do spicule matrix protein hydrogels offer
materials science and nanotechnology? As we stated earlier for nacre
proteins,25 we believe that there are several
important lessons that one can glean from this sea urchin study. The
first is that charged, disordered, aggregation-prone polymers can
form ion-responsive hydrogels in solution under a wide variety of
conditions (Figures 2–4). The second is that the predominance
of either anionic or cationic charged groups may allow for variations
in hydrogel morphology and internal structure (Figures 2–4) and the
response of charged solutes to the hydrogel (Figure 5, Table 1). Finally, considering our light microscopy and flow
cytometry observations (Figures 2–4), we speculate that
the changes in particle granularity or internal RI reflect changes
in hydrogel porosities, either in terms of the number of porosities,
their size, and/or their location within the protein hydrogel particles.17,18,25 In turn, these adjustments to
ionic media may eventually influence the formation, size, and distribution
of mineral nanoparticles within the hydrogels.17,18 Thus, similar to their nacre counterparts,19−25 spicule matrix protein hydrogels are worthy of further exploration
in future studies, such that we can apply these concepts to new and
useful composite, responsive smart hydrogels for materials and nanotechnology
applications.1−7
