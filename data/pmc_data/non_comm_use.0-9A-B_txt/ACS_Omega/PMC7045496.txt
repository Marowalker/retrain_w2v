4-N,N-Dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalimide conjugate of
trehalose (DMN-Tre) is a fluorogenic
dye recently developed as a diagnostic tool for tuberculosis. DMN-Tre
selectively labels the mycobacterial cell wall through the Ag85 enzymes.
In this work, we disclose a protocol describing the total synthesis
of DMN-Tre with more than 99% purity. We further developed a protocol
for in vitro and intercellular labeling of various mycobacterial strains.
DMN-Tre labeling was found to be a useful tool to study in vitro and
intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and as an end-point readout system in high-content
image-based screening (HCS) of drug molecules. Such uses of DMN-Tre
labeling provide a simple, fast, and cheap alternative to the existing,
time-consuming approach that requires Mtb strains to be genetically
transformed with fluorescent reporter genes.

Introduction
Tuberculosis
(TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease. Each
year, TB claims the lives of 1.3 million people,1 despite being curable with affordable and accessible antibiotics
to treat this infection. However, major drawbacks of current TB therapy
are lengthy treatment durations and poor efficacy against multidrug-resistant
(MDR) Mtb.2,3 Accordingly, drug development programs focus
on developing new agents that are capable of tackling these challenges.

Targeting intracellular mycobacteria is an established approach
in current TB drug development4−9 and provides great potential to offer novel
TB treatment compounds.10,11 The approach, in general,
involves an in-depth study of the intracellular lifestyle of Mtb and
development of compounds that target specific metabolic pathways essential
for intracellular growth or factors rendering the pathogen less effective
in evading the host’s natural ability to clear the pathogen.12 Successful
development of such compounds requires an in-depth understanding of
the disease pathology, as it helps to identify novel drug targets
and a suitable, preferably, image-based high-content drug screening
platforms that facilitate active compound identification.

Tracing
intracellular mycobacteria typically relies on the expression of fluorescent
proteins that facilitate detection of the bacteria by fluorescent
microscopy.13−16 This approach became popular in mycobacterial
research after Kremer et al. successfully cloned Mtb with a green
fluorescent (GFP) reporter gene for the first time.17 However, though proven to be effective, the standard method
for producing fluorescent mycobacteria by genetic manipulation has
some limitations, including the need to transform each strain of interest
with the gene encoding the fluorescent protein. This is especially
challenging and time consuming when working with multiple mutant strains
or assaying numerous clinical isolates that all require fluorescence.
Furthermore, the transformation may alter the pathophysiological properties
of the bacterium.18 One strategy to overcome
these challenges is to label mycobacteria using chemical-based fluorogenic
probes.

The use of chemical fluorogenic dyes for metabolic labeling
of mycobacteria is relatively new. The first of such mycobacteria-specific
fluorogenic probes was reported by Backus et al.19 This fluorescein-containing trehalose (FITC-Tre) probe
is metabolically incorporated into the cell wall of mycobacteria by
the Ag85 enzyme complex and was used for both in vitro and ex vivo
labeling. Soon after, more trehalose-based labeling probes were reported.
These include a series of azide-modified trehaloses (TreAz),20 O- and N-alkylated trehalose monomycolates (O-AlkTMM
and N-AlkTMM, respectively),21 a quencher–trehalose–fluorophore
(QTF),22 and trehalose conjugated to a
dye, 4-N,N-dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalimide
(DMN-Tre).23

DMN-Tre (Figure 1) is a solvatochromic dye that
exhibits marked enhancement of fluorescence following a transition
from an aqueous to a lipophilic environment. Therefore, a fluorescence
signal is only detected after mycobacteria take up the dye and metabolically
incorporate it into its lipophilic cell wall. Specific incorporation
of this dye is achieved by the bacterial Ag85 enzyme complex after
mycolation at the 6′-OH position. The dye was shown to rapidly
label mycobacteria in vitro and in sputum taken from TB patients,
demonstrating its potential for TB diagnosis.23

Figure 1 Structure of DMN-Tre.

Labeling of mycobacteria with DMN-Tre offers a number of advantages.
First, no postlabeling wash is required, as the excess nonincorporated
dye does not fluoresce and therefore does not cause background interference.
Second, incorporation of the dye requires that the bacteria be metabolically
active and thus the dye can differentiate between viable and nonviable
bacterial cells.

A protocol that describes the synthesis of
DMN-Tre, from its immediate precursors, 6-aminotrehalose and 4-N,N-dimethylamino-1,8-napthalic anhydride,
was previously reported.23 However, the
complete synthetic route including the synthesis of the two starting
materials was not provided. As both 6-aminotrehalose and 4-N,N-dimethylamino-1,8-napthalic anhydride
are not accessible from common commercial sources, a protocol that
fully describes the synthesis of DMN-Tre is needed.

The main
objective of this work is to synthesize DMN-Tre and adapt it for intracellular
labeling of mycobacteria with the aim to develop a tool for end-point
detection in high-content image-based screening of active compounds
and host–pathogen interaction studies of intracellular mycobacteria.

Results and Discussion
DMN-Tre Synthesis
The scheme for the total synthetic
route of DMN-Tre is outlined in Figure 2. The first step involved the protection of all free
hydroxyl groups of trehalose as trimethylsilyl (TMS) ethers. This
protecting group was chosen as it can be easily introduced and selectively
removed in the presence of secondary TMS ethers.24 The synthesis was done by treating trehalose with TMS chloride
(TMS-Cl) in pyridine solvent as described by Toubiana et al.25 This provided the fully protected 2,3,4,6,2′,3′,4′6′-octa-O-TMS
trehalose (1) with a yield of 90% after column purification.

Figure 2 Total
synthetic route
for DMN-Tre. Reagents and conditions: (a) TMS-Cl, pyridine, 0 °C
to rt, 19 h; (b) 0.2% K2CO3/MeOH, 0 °C,
20 min; (c) Tf2O, pyridine, DCM, 0 °C to rt,2 h; (d)
NaN3, dimethylformamide (DMF), 0 °C to rt, 12 h; (e)
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/dioxane/H2O, rt, 1 h; (f) H2, Pd/C (10%), MeOH, 1 h; (g) 3-dimethylaminopropionitrile,
3-methyl-1-butanol, 132 °C, 12 h; and (h) NaHCO3,
EtOH, N2, 85 °C, 8 h.

The next step involved the selective removal of only one of the
TMS protection groups and setting the 6-hydroxy group free. This was
achieved through controlled alkaline hydrolysis of 1 using
a catalytic amount of potassium carbonate (0.2% K2CO3) in methanol26,27 for 20 min. Column purification
provided the 2,3,4,2′,3′,4′6′-hepta-O-TMS
trehalose-6-ol (2) at 40% 2,3,4,2′,3′,4′-hexa-O-TMS
trehalose-6, 6′-diol (30%) and the starting material 1 (30%), which was regenerated and reused.

The free
6-hydroxyl group of 2 was activated to its triflate analogue
(3) and then transformed to azide (4) by
treatment with sodium azide in DMF.28 Triflation
of the primary alcohol of 2 was achieved by treating
with triflic anhydride in anhydrous dichloromethane in the presence
of pyridine.29 This step was found to be
challenging as the use of a little excess triflic anhydride released
the very strong triflic acid during the workup and caused a premature
deprotection of the remaining TMS protecting groups. For this reason,
we opted to use the crude product directly for the next reaction.

After triflate to azide transformation, global deprotection of the
remaining TMS protecting groups of 4 was accomplished
using a cleaving cocktail made of H2O/TFA/THF (33:8:17).28 Subsequently, the azide functional group of 5 was reduced to its corresponding primary amine group by
catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C (10%) as a catalyst in methanol.30 This provided the first immediate precursor
of DMN-Tre, 6-aminotrehalose (6).

The other immediate
precursor of the dye, 4-N,N-dimethylaminonaphthalic
anhydride (7), was synthesized from 4-bromophthalic anhydride
in one step following a previously reported method31 with an isolated yield of 78%.

The final step in
the synthesis of DMN-Tre was the coupling of 6 and 7 as previously described by Kamariza et al.23 This reaction gave the target compound, DMN-Tre (8), with an isolated yield of 35% and a purity level greater
than 99% after reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) purification. The identity of the product was confirmed
by 1H NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS)
(Figure S1).

In Vitro Labeling of Mycobacteria Using DMN-Tre
To determine
the optimal dose and to assess the suitability of DMN-Tre for labeling
different Mtb strains of interest, in vitro labeling was performed.
Mtb H37Rv expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP-Mtb H37Rv) was grown
in the presence of DMN-Tre at various concentrations for 24 h (Figure 3). Colocalization
of the fluorescence signals between GFP (for DMN-Tre) and RFP channels
(Figure 3) showed that
all of the bacteria that appeared in the RFP channel could also be
seen in the GFP channel. This indicates that complete labeling could
be achieved at concentrations of 100 μM as previously reported23 and as low as 75 μM. At 50 μM, the
labeling efficiency declined and was undetected at 25 μM.

RFP-Mtb H37v with DMN-Tre. Images
were collected in the differential interference contrast (DIC), green
fluorescent protein (GFP, for DMN-Tre fluorescence), and red fluorescent
protein (RFP, for bacterial dTomato fluorescence) channels using the
Evos FL auto imaging system fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher).
Magnifications are 20×. “Overlay” represents merged
images from all channels. Scale bars = 25 μm.

We also tested various Mtb mutant strains for their ability to take
up the dye. These Mtb mutants were either constructed or grown in
our lab to elucidate the mode of action of previously identified anti-TB
hit compounds.9 Comparative analysis of
Mtb H37Rv-resistant mutants to various anti-TB compounds (Table S1) showed that all of the mutants were
labeled (Figures S2–S6). Additionally,
we were able to label the Mtb Erdman strain and a Δrv1747 Erdman deletion mutant32 using DMN-Tre,
demonstrating the potential of the dye to be used as a viable chemical
labeling tool for mycobacterial research.

Intracellular Labeling of Mycobacteria Using DMN-Tre
Macrophages derived from the human monocyte cell line (THP-1) are
commonly used to study the intracellular life cycle of Mtb and for
screening of anti-TB compounds.9,33 The most common approach
for these tasks is to use a genetically modified Mtb strain expressing
a fluorescent reporter gene. The use of a chemical probe that can
quickly and efficiently label intracellular mycobacteria would greatly
facilitate research by reducing the effort and lengthy time needed
for genetic transformations. Accordingly, the ability of DMN-Tre to
label intracellular Mtb was assessed using this model.

First,
we tested whether DMN-Tre was toxic to THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were
exposed to the dye at different concentrations for 4 days, after which
cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
to label their nuclei. THP-1 cell viability was assessed based on
nuclei count. Tolerability assessment for the dye was then made by
comparing the number of viable cell counts of DMN-Tre treated wells
vs water control. No statistically significant difference in the cell
count between the treated and control groups was observed at all tested
concentrations (Figure S7), indicating
that DMN-Tre was well tolerated by THP-1 cells.

Next, we proceeded
to assess if DMN-Tre could be used to label intracellular Mtb within
THP-1 cells. Macrophages that had been infected with RFP-Mtb H37v
were subsequently incubated in media containing 100 μM DMN-Tre
for 24 and 96 h. Microscopy analysis revealed that the DMN-Tre probe
was indeed incorporated into intracellular Mtb, indicating that the
dye was able to reach the intracellular compartments of the macrophage.
The DMN-Tre signal overlapped with the RFP signal, showing that all
bacteria were labeled with the dye (Figure 4). Full labeling was observed to be completed
as early as 24 h with no difference in intensity when prolonged to
4 days. Additionally, DMN-Tre was also successful in labeling a deletion
mutant of Mtb, as well as the vaccine M. bovis BCG strain, intracellularly (Figure S8).

96 h of incubation of the Mtb-infected THP-1 cells with DMN-Tre. Images
were collected in the DIC, DAPI (for NucBlue fluorescence of the nuclear
stain), GFP (for DMN-Tre fluorescence), and RFP (for bacterial dTomato
fluorescence) channels of the Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope.

images from all channels. Scale bars = 25 μm.

DMN-Tre Labeling Does Not Alter
Intracellular Mtb Growth
The lipid composition of the mycobacterial
cell wall contributes to Mtb virulence. Accordingly, modifications
to the membrane composition may affect the ability of the bacteria
to infect and/or grow within macrophages.12,34 To
evaluate the impact of DMN-Tre labeling on Mtb intracellular growth,
RFP-Mtb H37v was prelabeled with the dye before macrophage infection.
The infected macrophages were then maintained in media containing
100 μM DMN-Tre for the entire incubation period. Macrophages
infected with unlabeled RFP-Mtb H37Rv and maintained in media free
of DMN-Tre were used as a control.

The impact of the labeling
was then assessed by quantifying the intracellular bacterial load
immediately after infection and after 4 days of infection. The intracellular
Mtb burden was assessed by quantifying the RFP signal at a validated
radius around each macrophage’s stained nucleus using the CellInsight
CX5 high-content platform. Such techniques for quantifying intracellular
Mtb has been previously validated.7,35−37 The intracellular Mtb
load was increased by 100% for both prelabeled and nonlabeled bacteria
after 4 days of infection (Figure 5), indicating that DMN-Tre does not inhibit the ability
of Mtb to infect or grow within the macrophages. A similar finding
was also previously reported when assessing the impact of FITC-Tre
labeling on the intracellular growth of Mtb.19

Figure 5 Effect of DMN-Tre labeling
on the intracellular growth of RFP-Mtb H37Rv. Macrophages were infected
with RFP-expressing Mtb H37Rv with or without prelabeling with DMN-Tre.
The intracellular Mtb growth was assessed based on the increase in
intensity of the fluorescent signal measured from the infected macrophages
on day 0 and day 4. Growth at day 0 was set as 0%. Error bars represent
standard error (SE), n = 4.

DMN-Tre as a Tool for Studying Host–Pathogen
Interactions
As an intracellular pathogen, Mtb interacts
with its host by inhibiting the ability of the macrophage to clear
the infection.38 Normally, macrophages
destroy invading organisms through a process of phagosome maturation
leading to fusion with lysosomes and activation of immune recognition.
Mtb secretes a key phosphatase, PtpA, that binds the host vacuolar-H(+)-ATPase,
disrupting phagosome acidification, and dephosphorylates VPS33B, involved
in tethering the phagosome to the lysosome membranes, thus blocking
phagosome–lysosome fusion.39,40 Genetic deletion
of ptpA in Mtb (ΔptpA) results
in normal macrophage phagosome maturation and colocalization of VPS33B
and the V-ATPase subunit H with ΔptpA, but
not wild-type (wt) Mtb.40

Here, we
tested whether DMN-Tre could be applied to study this colocalization
event using fluorescence microscopy. We used DMN-Tre to fluorescently
labeled ΔptpA and wt Mtb and lysotracker to
label macrophage lysosomal compartments. Figure 6 shows that the ΔptpA mutant colocalized with the lysotracker tag, while the parental
wt strain did not, confirming the role of ptpA in
controlling this process and validating the use of DMN-Tre.

tracking of phagolysosome fusion. (a) Colocalization of lysotracker

Error bars represent the standard deviation (SD). **p-value < 0.01.

A similar approach could be followed to prelabel various constructs
of Mtb mutants with DMN-Tre and infect macrophages to study other
mediators of host–pathogen interaction and monitor Mtb infection
and its effect on the host immunophysiology.

DMN-Tre as a Fluorescence End-Point Readout Tool for High-Content
Image-Based Screening
High-content screening (HCS) has become
a powerful approach for screening new compounds effective against
Mtb. However, a prerequisite for HCS is that the bacteria need to
be labeled for visualization. Often, there is a need to screen against
strains that are not genetically labeled such as clinical isolates
and mutant Mtb strains without a priori genetic manipulation. Therefore,
a new end-point detection system is needed. The suitability of DMN-Tre
as a readout system for HCS was assessed using a 96-well plate format
and compared to a traditional RFP readout system. THP-1 cells infected
with DMN-Tre-labeled Mtb H37Rv or RFP-Mtb H37Rv were treated with
the TB drug, rifampicin (Rif), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
or DMSO alone control. Similar effects of the drug were observed using
DMN-Tre as readout, albeit with less intensity compared to that of
RFP (Figure 7).

DMN-Tre labeling.
(a) Intracellular viability of Mtb H37Rv using DMN-Tre labeling as
an end-point readout. THP-1 cells were infected with Mtb H37Rv, treated
with or without 5 μM Rif in DMSO and incubated in a media containing
DMN-Tre. Mtb viability was calculated as a percentage of the average
fluorescence intensity of the DMSO control (set at 100%). (b) Comparison

H37Rv, treated with or without 5 μM Rif in DMSO and incubated
in a media containing DMN-Tre. Fluorescence was measured from the
GFP channel using DMN-Tre labeling as a readout (green bars) and the
RFP channel using red fluorescence protein expression as a readout
(red bars). Error bars in (a) and (b) represent the SE. *p-value = 0.0002; ** and ***p-values < 0.0001.

Once the suitability of DMN-Tre for HCS of anti-Mtb control compounds
was assessed, a dose–response assay with another TB drug, bedaquiline
(BDQ), was performed. The intracellular IC50 values of
BDQ obtained from inhibition curves determined using the GFP and RFP
channels were similar (Figure 8, 0.12 and 0.14 μM, respectively) and are within the
range of the previously reported concentration of 0.13 μM.41 To examine suitability for a screening assay,
the Z′ score was calculated for BDQ (3 μM)
and determined as 0.6 and 0.4 for DMN-Tre and RFP, respectively. This
is a good signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting that DMN-Tre could be
used for high-throughput HCS of a larger number of compounds.

96-well-plate-containing THP-1 cells infected with RFP-Mtb H37Rv stained
or unstained with DMN-Tre were treated with 1% DMSO (six wells) as
a negative control corresponding to 100% bacterial growth and 3 μM
BDQ (eight wells) as a positive control in which 100% inhibition of
bacterial growth was reached. Controls were used to monitor assay
quality through the determination of the Z′ score.

Conclusions
In this work, a protocol
describing the total synthesis of DMN-Tre at more than 99% purity
was developed. The suitability of the dye to label various Mtb mutant
strains and other mycobacterial species was assessed, and the optimal
dose required for in vitro labeling was determined. Moreover, the
dye was shown to be efficient in labeling various intracellular mycobacterial
strains in infected macrophages. This intracellular labeling was achieved
with limited or no toxicity to the host and without altering virulence
characteristics of the bacteria. The finding that DMN-Tre successfully
labeled intracellular Mtb was then further applied to study intracellular
events of Mtb infection and as an end-point readout tool in image-based
HCS of new antitubercular compounds.

Transforming Mtb with fluorescent
reporter genes has proven to be a powerful tool to study Mtb physiology
and for high-throughput genetic and small molecule screening. However,
due to the slow-growing nature of Mtb, this approach is often time
consuming, costly, and a tedious process. The applicability of DMN-Tre
for in vitro and intracellular labeling of Mtb provides a simple,
rapid, and less expensive alternative to the already existing methods.
This work underscores the potential of DMN-Tre to be used in drug
discovery and basic research in addition to being a useful tool for
TB diagnostics as originally described.23

Mycobacterial
Strains and Growth Media
Mycobacterial
Strains
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis H37Rv harboring RFP-expressing pTEC27
plasmid, M. tuberculosis ΔptpA
(constructed as previously described42), Mangora bovis BCG, and 14 other Mtb mutants that
were grown to elucidate the mode of action of previously identified
anti-Mtb compounds (Table S1) were utilized
for the experiment.

All of the mycobacterial strains were routinely
grown in 7H9 broth (Difco Middlebrook) supplemented with 10% (v/v)
OADC (0.05% oleic acid, 5% bovine albumin fraction, 2% dextrose, 0.004%
catalase, and 0.8% sodium chloride solution) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween
80 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in standing cultures. For Mtb pTEC27,
hygromycin B was added to the medium at a final concentration of 50
μg/mL.

THP-1 Cells and
Culture Media
The THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202) used are derived
from human monocytes obtained from a 1 year old male infant with acute
monocytic leukemia. The cells were stored in liquid nitrogen.

THP-1 cells were grown in complete RPMI medium. The cells were grown
in tissue culture flask with a minimum volume of 20 mL and a maximum
volume of 50 mL and were incubated in an atmosphere of 95% air and
5% carbon dioxide (CO2) at a temperature of 37 °C.
Cell density was kept between 0.25 and 1 million cells/mL. Every 2
or 3 days, the cells were counted in a microscope and diluted to 0.25
million cells/mL. The cells doubled approximately every 48 h. A culture
from liquid nitrogen stock was subcultured for up to 3 months; after
this time, a change in morphology and growth behavior was observed
and a fresh stock was used.

For culturing of THP-1 cells, RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2% glutamine,
1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin + streptomycin was
used (complete RPMI medium).

For assays, RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 5% FBS, 1% glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids was used
(incomplete RPMI medium).

In Vitro Labeling of Mycobacteria with DMN-Tre
Cultures of Mtb and mutants were made by inoculation of a 1 mL frozen
glycerol stock into 10 mL of a Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium supplemented
with a 10% (v/v) OADC enrichment and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 in a tissue
culture flask. Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm
(OD600) between 0.4 and 0.6 to begin the experiments. Bacterial
cultures were mixed with DMN-Tre at a concentration of 75 μM
in 7H9 medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 1 day.
Labeled bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation (4000°
rpm, RT, for 10 min), washed with PBS, and then either used for macrophage
infection or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (room temperature
for 45 min) on coverslips for microscopic analysis.

Tolerability Assay
A cell suspension of
THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/mL) in RPMI incomplete
was seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 50 000 cells
per well and allowed to differentiate overnight by adding PMA (40
ng/mL). Differentiated cells were washed once with warm RPMI, and
fresh RPMI incomplete was added to each well with DMN-Tre added at
concentrations of 100, 200, and 300 μM to wells in triplicates
for each concentration. The vehicle (water) was used as an untreated
control. The plates were then sealed by parafilm and incubated in
a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 days.
At the end of the incubation period, the media was aspirated, cells
were washed twice with PBS, stained with DAPI, and their viability
was quantified using a CellInsight CX5 high-content screening (HCS)
platform (Thermo Scientific).

Macrophage
Infection
Mycobacterial cultures grown to log phase were
centrifuged at 4000° rpm, for 10 min at room temperature, washed
once in 7H9 media containing 0.05% Tween 80, and resuspended in RPMI
medium. Cells were de-clumped using a needle, and OD600 was measured to estimate cell density using the formula (OD600 ≈ 3.3 × 108 CFU/mL). Before infection,
bacterial suspension was opsonized by adding a 10% human serum and
incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. A cell suspension of THP-1 cells
(1 × 106 cells/mL) in RPMI incomplete was incubated
with the opsonized Mtb single-cell suspension at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI of 2:1) and simultaneously differentiated with 40 ng/mL
PMA for 4 h at 37 °C under constant agitation. After infection,
the THP-1 cell suspension was centrifuged (750 rpm, RT, 10 min) and
washed twice with RPMI. The cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI incomplete
media at 1 × 105 cells/mL and dispensed either into
96-well clear, flat bottom plates or 24-well plates containing glass
coverslips at the bottom of the wells with a cell density of 1 ×
105 cells/mL.

Intracellular
Mycobacterial Labeling
Macrophages infected with Mtb, Mtb
mutants, or M. bovis BCG (according
to the macrophage infection protocol described above) were dispensed
in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips at the bottom of the
wells. DMN-Tre (100 μM) was added to each well, and the plates
were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 or 4 days. At the end of the incubation period, the
media was aspirated, coverslips were taken out, and cells were washed
twice with PBS buffer, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS buffer for 30 min,
stained with NucBlue, and visualized under confocal microscopy.

Impact of DMN-Tre Prelabeling on Infectivity
of Mtb
RFP-Mtb H37v was prelabeled with DMN-Tre and used
to infect macrophages. The infected macrophages were dispensed in
96-well plates (clear, flat bottom) at a cell density of 5 ×
104 cells/well. DMN-Tre (100 μM) was added to wells
containing cells infected with prelabeled RFP-Mtb H37v. Similarly,
macrophages infected with a nonlabeled RFP-Mtb H37Rv strain were used
as control. Plates were sealed with parafilm and incubated in a humidified
incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1 or 4 days. After
incubation, the cells were fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min and stained
with NucBlue. Monitoring of the intracellular growth was performed
using the CellInsight CX5 high-content platform.

Colocalization Study with Lysotracker
THP-1
cells were infected with Mtb (wild type or ΔptpA) prelabeled, with DMN-Tre (MOI of 5), and dispensed in 24-well
plates containing glass coverslips at the bottom of the wells. After
90 min of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the Lysotracker DND 99 was added at 75 nM and the incubation
was continued for an additional 30 min. The media was aspirated, and
cover glass slips were taken out. Cells were washed twice with PBS,
stained with NucBlue Live, fixed in 4% PFA for 45 min, and visualized
under confocal microscopy.

DMN-Tre
for End-Point Readout System in HCS
Macrophages were infected
with RFP-Mtb H37Rv or Mtb H37Rv and seeded (cell density = 50 000
cells/well) to a 96-well plate containing rifampin (5 μM) or
different concentrations of bedaquiline (BDQ) in RPMI incomplete media.
DMSO (1%) was used as a negative control. DMN-Tre (100 μM) was
then added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C
with 5% CO2 for 4 days. On day 4, the media was aspirated
and the cells were fixed with 2.5% PFA. Following NucBlue staining
of the nuclei, intracellular bacterial loads were quantified using
the CellInsight CX5 high-content platform by measuring the intensity
of either GFP (green circles for DMN-Tre) or red squares for RFP fluorescence
signals.

Statistical Analysis
Data are means ± SEM from at least two independent experiments.
Unless otherwise specified, all data were analyzed using the GraphPad
Prism software’s analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, as indicated
in figure legends. Images obtained from the fluorescent microscopy
were analyzed using the Image J program.

Quantification of Intracellular Mtb
Quantification
of intracellular Mtb load was done using the CellInsight CX5 high-content
platform. First, the macrophage nuclei are identified and counted
using the DAPI signal; cell debris and other particles are deducted
based on a size filter tool. Following this, a region of interest
or “circle” is drawn around each host cell nucleus to
encompass where Mtb (spots) are located. Finally, the software identifies,
counts, and measures the pixel area of the “spots” within
the circle based on the RFP signal. The fluorescent spot area measured
within each cell (circle) was then added and quantified for each well
and displayed on the data analysis software. The average circle spot
area of each well corresponds to the intracellular Mtb burden and
was used to quantify the Mtb load.
