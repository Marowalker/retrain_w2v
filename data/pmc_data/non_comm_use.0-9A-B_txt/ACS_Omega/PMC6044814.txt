Appropriate
localization of a drug and its structure/functional
integrity in a delivery agent essentially dictates the efficacy of
the vehicle and the medicinal activity of the drug. In the case of
a phototherapeutic drug, its photoinduced dynamics becomes an added
parameter. Here, we have explored the photoinduced dynamical events
of a model phototherapeutic drug psoralen (PSO) in a potential delivery
vehicle called an ethosome. Dynamic light scattering confirms the
structural integrity of the ethosome vehicle after the encapsulation
of PSO. Steady state and picosecond resolved polarization gated spectroscopy,
including the well-known strategy of solvation and Förster
resonance energy transfer, reveal the localization of the drug in
the vehicle and the environment in the proximity of PSO. We have also
investigated the efficacy of drug delivery to various individual bacteria
(Gram-negative: Escherichia coli; Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus) and bacterial biofilms. Our
optical and electron microscopic studies reveal a significant reduction
in bacterial survival (∼70%) and the destruction of bacterial
adherence following a change in the morphology of the biofilms after
phototherapy. Our studies are expected to find relevance in the formulation
of drug delivery agents in several skin diseases and biofilm formation
in artificial implants.

Introduction
Over the past 2 decades, photodynamic
therapy has been harnessed
for the treatment of a broad range of diseases.1,2 The
action of this therapy is based on the topical application of a photosensitive
drug (photosensitizer) followed by irradiation, usually in the ultraviolet-A
(UVA: 320–400 nm) or visible (vis: 400–720 nm) region
of the spectrum.3,4 The photosensitizer will absorb
the radiation and conduct the excitation energy into the tissue. This
phenomenon leads to an array of photochemical redox and/or radical
reactions.5 The family of linear furocoumarins
and their derivatives, more customarily known as psoralen (PSO), have
been shown to be active dermal photosensitizing agents in the presence
of UVA.6−8 PSO intercalates with DNA upon irradiation with UVA
and subsequently forms adducts with pyrimidine bases in the opposite
strand of DNA, resulting in DNA strand cross-linking.9,10 These result in the inhibition of cell division; thus, PSO followed
by UV radiation is widely used for the treatment of psoriasis.11,12

The efficacy of a drug depends on its penetration capability
within
the phospholipid membrane of the cell, which is necessary for it to
reach its cellular targets.13 The major
difficulty with naturally occurring PSO is its insolubility in water,
which leads to weak percutaneous permeability and poor deposition
in the skin.14,15 The poor solubility of the drug
usually requires that it is frequently administered, increasing the
risk of adverse reactions.15 Topical delivery
of drugs by liposomal formulations has attracted considerable interest
in recent decades because of the improved therapeutic effects.16,17 However, classical liposomes are of little use because they cannot
penetrate the cellular or bacterial membrane.18 On the other hand, several lines of research have indicated that
ethosomes, which are in a class of liposomes containing some amount
of ethanol in the core, could be a better tool for the subdermal delivery
of macromolecules.19,20 Earlier, it was shown that as
the concentration of ethanol in ethosomes increases from 20 to 45%,
the drug entrapment efficiency improves owing to an elevation in the
fluidity of the membrane.21 Several in
vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated the enhanced skin permeation
and bioavailability of different therapeutic agents from a biocompatible
ethosomal formulation.22,23 For instance, Dubey et al. prepared
an ethosomal formulation of indinavir, an anti-HIV drug, and investigated
its augmented transdermal delivery potential.24 Our previous articles reported the delivery of significant photosensitizers
using zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as a competent drug delivery
vehicle, where an increased efficacy of the phototherapeutic drugs
upon conjugation with ZnO NPs was also successfully observed.25−27

Although research studies have reported the topical delivery
of
PSO via ethosomes,28 very little is known
about the photoinduced dynamics of PSO encapsulated in this drug delivery
vehicle. In the present study, we synthesized ethosomes of 110 nm
vesicular size and entrapped PSO in the ethosomal formulation (PSO–ethosome),
which was characterized by UV–vis absorption and steady state
fluorescence spectroscopic methods and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
studies. A well-known solvation probe, 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran (DCM),29 was employed to study solvent relaxation in
the ethosomes.30 Picosecond-resolved Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) was exploited to confirm the colocalization
of PSO in ethosomes with crystal violet (CV), a well-known ethosome-binding
organic dye.31 After thorough characterization
of the interfacial events, the PSO–ethosomes were evaluated
for their photoinduced antibacterial activity toward Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.

Life-threatening bacterial
diseases originate due to the formation
of biofilms, making bacterial infections challenging to cure. The
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) comprising the biofilm prevent
the penetration of drugs into the biofilm.32,33 Thus, we employed PSO–ethosomes to study the eradication
of biofilms because this requires the efficient penetration and accumulation
of the drug into the biofilm network. A CV assay was used to assess
the antibiofilm activity of PSO–ethosomes against E. coli and S. aureus.34 We further performed scanning electron
microscopy to observe the morphological changes of the biofilm upon
treatment with PSO–ethosomes in the presence of UVA. Therefore,
our studies investigate a permeation-enhancing carrier, ethosomes,
which facilitate the transport of PSO through a biological barrier:
the bacterial membrane or cell wall. This may result in an alternative
use and an enhanced efficiency of ethosomes as a drug delivery vehicle
for antibiotic-resistant biofilms.

Results and Discussion
Ethosomes are a soft vesicle composed of phospholipids (PC), a
high concentration of ethanol, and water. In our study, we synthesized
ethosomal solutions having characteristic spherical droplets with
an average hydrodynamic diameter of 110 nm measured by DLS (inset
of Figure 1a). Absorption
spectra of PSO in a water–ethanol mixture and in ethosomes
are shown in Figure 1a, which shows that PSO in a water–ethanol mixture (red) has
three peaks at 244, 294, and 340 nm. PSO encapsulated in ethosomes
(blue) also shows three peaks with an uplifted baseline due to scattering of colloidal ethosomes.
The transitions at 294 and 340 nm are reported to result from the
n → π* transition of nonbonding electrons on the C-2
carbonyl group in PSO and the π → π* transition
of π electrons of the PSO ring system, respectively.7 We estimated that 88.7 μM PSO is associated
with 3.4 μM ethosomes. In other words, 26 PSO molecules are
attached to each ethosome vesicle. Emission spectra of PSO in a water–ethanol
mixture (red) and PSO–ethosomes (blue) (Figure 1b) show that the fluorescence intensity of
PSO is quenched upon its encapsulation in ethosomes. The quenching
of the emission of PSO in a nonpolar medium, cyclohexane (green),
is also shown in Figure 1b. The quantum yield of PSO in aqueous ethanol, ethosomes, and cyclohexane
are estimated to be 1.0 × 10–2, 6.0 ×
10–3, and 2.0 × 10–4, respectively,
consistent with the literature.35 Studies
on the spectroscopic properties of PSO have reported that the lowest
excited state (singlet and triplet) energies of PSO are strongly dependent
on the polarity of the solvent. As the polarity of the solvent increases,
the energy level ordering of PSO is assumed to change and thereby
fluorescence becomes predominant compared to nonradiative intersystem
crossing.35,36 Upon encapsulation into ethosomes, the polarity
of the solvent around PSO decreases, which results in a quenching
of the fluorescence intensity without changing the emission maxima.
The similarity of the quantum yield of PSO in ethosomes with polar
aqueous ethanol indicates that the location of the probe is at the
interface. We have also recorded excitation spectra (Figure 1b, inset) of PSO in water–ethanol
and PSO–ethosomes, which are similar to the corresponding absorption
spectra. Figure 1c
shows picosecond resolved emission transients of PSO in various media
including ethosomes. The numerical fitting of the transients reveals
an average time constant of 0.62 ns for aqueous ethanol and 0.34 ns
for cyclohexane. In ethosomes, the average time constant of 0.50 ns
is close to that in aqueous ethanol, revealing that the location of
PSO is at the interface.

To compare the microenvironment
of the ethosomes with liposomes,
we used a well-known fluorescent solvation probe, DCM, which is widely
used in the characterization of various liposomes.37,38 The inset of Figure 2a represents the excitation and emission spectra of DCM in ethosomes.
The emission peak of DCM in ethosomes is blue-shifted to 570 nm compared
to that of DCM in buffer. This corresponds to the binding of DCM to
the hydrophobic core of the ethosomes. Figure 2a shows fluorescence transients of DCM encapsulated
in the ethosomes at three characteristic detection wavelengths (510,
580, and 670 nm), which fall in the blue, peak, and red end of the
emission spectrum of the probe in the ethosomes. In the excited state
of DCM, intramolecular charge transfer takes place, which gives rise
to a very high dipole moment (23.6 D) compared to the ground state.39 In the blue edge of the spectrum (510 nm), the
observation is consistent with the fact that DCM undergoes solvation
relaxation, where the signal is seen to decay faster compared to the
red edge (670 nm), whereas a rise component is apparent in ethosomes.
Using the fitting parameters of the fluorescence decay and the steady
state emission spectrum, the time-resolved emission spectra (TRES)
and the solvent correlation function (C(t)) of DCM in ethosomes were constructed (Figure 2b,c). The associated dynamical Stokes shift
(Δν) of DCM in ethosomes is calculated to be 1458 cm–1. It is evident that due to the finite time resolution
of our instrument (20–30 ps), we missed some portion of the
dynamics. We calculated the missing component to be ∼17% following
the procedure of Fee and Maroncelli.40,41 The C(t) decay of DCM is fitted with a biexponential
function with two time components of 430 ps (44%) and 3.04 ns (56%).
The time constants are consistent with the reported values of the
solvation relaxation time of DCM in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine
(DPPC) liposomes.38 The temporal decay
of fluorescence anisotropy r(t)
of DCM in ethosomes is shown in the inset of Figure 2c. The decay transient can be fitted monoexponentially
with a time constant of 38 ps (29%), with a significant part (71%)
that persists within our experimental time window of 20 ns (we show
up to 4 ns). The faster time constant is consistent with the tumbling
motion of DCM in the ethosomes.38

To study the colocalization of a model cationic drug with
hydrophobic
DCM in ethosomes, we used CV and employed a FRET strategy. Figure 3a shows the spectral
overlap of energy donor DCM emission with the absorption spectrum
of acceptor CV. A significant quenching of the steady-state emission
of DCM in the presence of CV in ethosomes is observed, where the DCM:CV
concentration in the ethosomal mixture is 1:1 (inset of Figure 3b). The picosecond-resolved
fluorescence decay profile of DCM in the absence (green) and presence
(blue) of CV was monitored at 620 nm upon excitation at 375 nm (Figure 3b). The shorter component
in the decay profile suggests an excited state energy transfer process
(Table 1). A FRET efficiency
of ∼75% with an average donor–acceptor distance of 5.8
nm was calculated for the DCM–CV pair (Table 1). It is also observed that the distance
between DCM and CV is independent of the detection wavelength by detecting
fluorescence transients at different wavelengths (data not shown).
This indicates that DCM is homogeneously distributed in the ethosomal
mixture. It is reported that the maximum thickness of a phospholipid
bilayer is 7.3 nm.42 Therefore, the possible
location of CV could be at the polar interface of the ethosome.

After
having an idea about the location of CV with respect to DCM,
we exploited the spectral overlap of CV with PSO to study the localization
of PSO in the ethosomes. A considerable spectral overlap of PSO’s
emission with the absorption spectrum of CV is shown in Figure 3c, where the concentration
of PSO:CV is 1:10, indicating the possibility of FRET from PSO to
CV in the ethosome. A significant quenching of the steady state emission
of PSO in the presence of CV in the ethosome is observed (inset of Figure 3d). The picosecond-resolved
fluorescence decay profile of PSO in ethosomes in the absence (red)
and presence (cyan) of CV was monitored at 450 nm upon excitation
at 375 nm (Figure 3d). The excited state lifetime (τav) of PSO is reduced
upon interaction with CV. Details of the fitting parameters for the
fluorescence decay are provided in Table 1. We estimated the FRET efficiency to be
∼84% and the donor (PSO)–acceptor (CV) distance to be
∼2.2 nm. This distance is almost independent of the detection
wavelength because there is no indication of a change in the lifetime
by changing the detection wavelength. More details are provided in Table 1. The comparatively
shorter donor–acceptor distance in the case of PSO–CV
can be attributed to the higher concentration of CV in the present
case compared to the former one.

Lastly, we evaluated PSO–ethosomes
as an antimicrobial agent
followed by a drug delivery system to inhibit the growth of bacterial
biofilms. PSO–ethosomes were employed as a potential photodynamic
agent to inhibit the growth of Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus. For
photodynamic therapy experiments, we added PSO–ethosomes (85
μM PSO) to bacterial cultures in the presence and absence of
UVA. The inhibition of bacterial growth after photodynamic treatment
is clearly visible. For comparison, the colonies were counted for
control and PSO–ethosome-treated plates. The colony forming
units (CFUs) indicate insignificant antibacterial activity of PSO–ethosomes
in the dark. In the case of samples treated with PSO–ethosomes
and UVA irradiation, the bacterial growth was inhibited sharply, indicating
immense photoinduced antimicrobial activity of PSO–ethosomes.
The maximum inhibition of E. coli was
obtained for PSO–ethosome-treated samples, where a 95% decrease
in CFUs was observed after photodynamic treatment (Figure 4a). Figure 4b,c clearly shows E. coli cultures treated with PSO–ethosomes in the absence and presence
of UVA light. The inhibition of bacterial growth after photodynamic
treatment is clearly visible. A similar trend was observed for Gram-positive
bacteria S. aureus (Figure 5a), demonstrating the enormous
photodynamic antibacterial activity of PSO–ethosomes. The pictures
of S. aureus culture plates (Figure 5b,c) clearly show
visual differences of PSO–ethosome-treated bacteria in the
absence and presence of UVA. Control experiments using ethosomes without
PSO show no significant antibacterial effect.

A biofilm is a microbial community that has a compact and
complex
structure and is often encapsulated within a matrix of polymeric material
that consists of intricate networks of cells attached to abiotic surfaces.43 Upon formation of a biofilm, microbes can resist
antibiotics and immune cell challenge and can be deeply inserted into
the cracks and pores of solid surfaces and metallic and nonmetallic
medical devices like catheters, implants, and dental materials.44 For our study, biofilm formation by E. coli and S. aureus was measured after 48 h. The total adhered biomass of the biofilms
was monitored through a quantitative assay using CV. There is a decrease
in biomass (∼30%) for both bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus) treated with ethosome-containing
PSO. The bacterial biomass could be further reduced to ∼60%
when PSO–ethosome-treated bacteria were exposed to UVA light
for 30 min (Figures 4d and 5d). The structural and morphological
changes of the biofilms were observed by taking SEM images.45Figure 4e shows typical characteristics of E. coli biofilms, and Figure 4f shows samples treated with PSO–ethosomes followed by UVA
irradiation, which contain significantly fewer bacteria and have lost
the typical arrangement of a biofilm. A similar effect was observed
for S. aureus biofilms (Figure 5e,f). The antibiofilm activity
of PSO–ethosomes suggests that ethanol entrapped in the ethosome
acts as a permeation enhancer due to a synergistic mechanism between
ethanol-containing vesicles and the bacterial membrane.46 Our findings suggest that PSO–ethosomes
possess increased permeability and an improved release rate because
ethanol has a fluidizing effect on phospholipid bilayers, which allow
the ethosomes to more easily penetrate through the bacterial cell
wall. Therefore, drug-containing ethosomes exhibit more efficient
photochemical activity for the inhibition of bacterial biofilm growth.
These studies on the photoinduced dynamics of PSO–ethosomes
as an efficient drug delivery vehicle will be helpful in the design
of future photodynamic agents.

Conclusions
In the present study,
we evaluated the photoinduced dynamics of
PSO, a photobiologically important drug, upon encapsulation in ethosomes.
We characterized PSO–ethosomes both structurally and spectroscopically.
In addition, we performed solvent relaxation studies in confined environments
using DCM as a model fluorophore. Picosecond-resolved FRET revealed
the binding of drug molecules in the vesicles. It is inferred that
there is a nonradiative energy transfer from PSO to CV upon excitation
with UVA light. Furthermore, the increase in cytotoxicity of PSO-loaded
ethosomes is found to be responsible for their improved antimicrobial
activity. The antibiofilm activity of PSO-loaded ethosomes against
both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria is also confirmed. Hence,
these studies will pave the way in the design of novel, high-potential
therapeutic drugs with improved pharmacological efficacy to treat
multi-drug-resistant bacteria-induced diseases.

Experimental Section
Materials
Analytical grade PSO, l-α-phosphatidylcholin
from soybean (PC), and CV were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India.
DCM was purchased from Exciton, USA. All reagents were used without
further purification. Ethanol (Merck, India) and water (Milli-Q, USA)
were used as solvents.

Synthesis of PSO- and DCM-Containing Ethosomes
PSO
and DCM were completely soluble in ethanol, and their concentrations
were estimated from known extinction coefficients. Five milligrams
of PC was dissolved in 40 μL of an ethanolic solution of PSO
or DCM and injected rapidly in warm water (∼40 °C) followed
by vigorous stirring. The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm
syringe filter (Millex-GP, USA).

Characterization Methods
Absorption spectra were taken
on a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer using a quartz cell of 1 cm
path length. Steady state fluorescence measurements were performed
using a Jobin Yvon Fluorolog, keeping the excitation and emission
bandwidth slits at 2 nm. The steady state emission of all samples
was taken upon excitation at 375 nm. The size distribution and hydrodynamic
diameter (dH) of the ethosomes were measured
from DLS experiments, performed on a Nano S Malvern instrument (4
mW, He–Ne laser, λ= 632.8 nm). Details of the experimental
techniques are described in our previous papers.47

Picosecond-resolved spectroscopic studies were done
using a commercial time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
setup from Edinburgh Instruments (instrument response function (IRF)
= 80 ps) using excitation at 375 nm. Fluorescence photons from the
sample were detected by a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube
(MCP-PMT, Hammamatsu) after dispersion through a grating monochromator.
For all decays, the emission polarizer was set at 54.7° (magic
angle) with respect to the polarization axis of the excitation beam.
The observed fluorescence transients were fitted using a nonlinear
least-squares fitting procedure. More details can be found elsewhere.25,48 To estimate the FRET efficiency and distance between donor PSO/DCM
and acceptor CV, we followed the traditional methodology described
in previous work.49

To construct
TRES, we followed techniques reported from our laboratory.50 TRES were constructed using transients detected
across the emission spectrum, starting from 500 to 650 nm at an interval
of 5 nm. The time-dependent fluorescence Stokes shifts, as estimated
from TRES, were used to construct the normalized spectral shift correlation
function or the solvent correlation function C(t) defined as 1  where ν(0), ν(t), and ν(∞) are the emission
maximum (in
cm–1) at times zero, t, and infinity,
respectively.51 The ν(∞) values were taken to be the emission frequency beyond which an
insignificant or no spectral shift was observed. The C(t) function represents the temporal response of
the solvent relaxation process, as occurs around the probe following
its photoexcitation and the associated change in the dipole moment.
Fluorescence anisotropy (r(t)) measurements
were performed as reported in previous papers at emission maxima with
the emission polarization adjusted to be parallel and perpendicular
to the excitation.50

Bacterial Strain
and Culture Conditions
The antibacterial
assays were performed using the common bacterial strains E. coli XL1-Blue52 and S. aureus MTCC 3160.53 The E. coli cells were cultured at
37 °C in liquid Luria–Bertani (LB) medium. When the optical
density reached ∼0.6, the culture was serially diluted 1000
times with LB medium and treated with drugs. The cells were treated
with ethosome and PSO–ethosome (the concentration of PSO was
85 μM) samples. The samples were then kept under UVA irradiation
(λmax = 390 nm) for 30 min. The photodynamic effect
was studied by placing 100 μL of treated samples on LB agar
plates and incubating them overnight at 37 °C. After incubation
overnight, the colonies were counted. The S. aureus cells were cultured in a liquid grade 3 media followed by the same
treatment protocol.

Development of Bacterial Biofilms
E.
coli and S. aureus biofilms
were cultured in their prescribed media (LB and liquid grade 3 medium,
respectively) on 60 mm polycarbonate Petri dishes. Two milliliters
of bacterial inoculum with an optical density of 0.8 was spread on
the Petri dishes and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C. Quantification
of the biofilms was done using CV [0.1% (w/v)] staining after washing
the attached cells.54 Briefly, unattached
cells were aspirated from the Petri dishes, which were subsequently
washed with 1 mL of water. CV solution (2 mL) was added to the dishes
and removed after 30 min by aspiration. Petri dishes were washed with
1 mL of water, and the remaining CV was solubilized in 95% ethanol.
The degree of CV staining was evaluated from the absorbance at 595
nm (A595). A595 values are considered to be an index of bacteria adherance to the
polycarbonate surface and forming a biofilm.55 To study the morphological changes in the biofilms upon different
treatment conditions, 200 μL of the respective bacterial broth
was kept over coverslips for 24 h at 37 °C, followed by washing
in water. The samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde followed
by successive dehydration in alcohol and air. A qualitative assessment
of the appearance of the biofilms was performed by scanning electron
microscopy. The coverslips were coated with gold and scanned in a
field emission scanning electron microscope (Quanta FEG 250: source
of electrons, FEG source; operational accelerating voltage, 200 V
to 30 kV; resolution, 30 kV under low vacuum conditions: 3.0 nm; detectors,
large field secondary electron detector for low vacuum operation).
