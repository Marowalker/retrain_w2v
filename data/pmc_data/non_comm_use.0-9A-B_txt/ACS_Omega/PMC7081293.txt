Designing and manufacturing
multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs)
are of considerable interest for both academic and industrial research.
Among NPs used in this field, iron oxide NPs show low toxicity compared
to metallic ones and are thus of high interest for biomedical applications.
In this work, superparamagnetic Fe3−δO4-based core/shell NPs were successfully prepared and characterized
by the combination of different techniques, and their physical properties
were investigated. We demonstrate the efficiency of the layer-by-layer
process to graft polyelectrolytes on the surface of iron oxide NPs.
The influence of the polyelectrolyte chain configuration on the magnetic
properties of the Fe3−δO4/polymer
core/shell NPs was enlightened. The simple and fast process described
in this work is efficient for the grafting of polyelectrolytes from
surfaces, and thus, derived Fe3−δO4 NPs display both the physical properties of the core and of the
macromolecular shell. Finally, the cytotoxicity toward the human THP-1
monocytic cell line of the core/shell NPs was assessed. The results
showed that the polymer-capped Fe3−δO4 NPs exhibited almost no toxicity after 24 h of exposure at
concentrations up to 25 μg mL–1. Our results
show that these smart superparamagnetic nanocarriers with stealth
properties are promising for applications in multimodal cancer therapy,
including drug delivery.

==== Body
Introduction
Owing to their numerous
and promising applications, superparamagnetic
iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) have attracted the interest of many research
groups worldwide.1−5 In the medical field, their development was shown to be of particular
interest as their superparamagnetic behavior guarantees a high magnetization
when submitted to a magnetic field, whereas no magnetic remanence
can be observed after their exposure to the magnetic field.6

The use of SPIONs in the medical field
requires their full stability
in biological fluids to take advantage of their physical properties.
Indeed, when bare iron oxide NPs are dispersed in complex media like
physiological fluids, their surface can be altered and the release
of Fe2+ ions leads to the loss of their physical properties
and to the increase of their cytotoxicity.7 Thus, strategies such as the preparation of core/shell NPs were
developed to graft a surrounding layer on the NPs to prevent the adsorption
of undesirable molecules or proteins that may alter NP physical properties.6,8 Moreover, the shell can ensure the passivation of the NP surface
for the full preservation of their magnetic properties.3,6,9 Finally, it is possible to synthesize
NPs with new physical and colloidal properties such as magnetic and
optical that could not be obtained if each nanomaterial was used separately.6 Among these strategies, the most commonly used
consists of the synthesis of inorganic/inorganic core/shell NPs in
which the core is surrounded by a shell composed of at least one layer.8,10−14 For example, these new nanomaterials could display magnetic and
luminescence properties, or if the shell is composed of a porous silica
layer,15−17 drugs could be loaded and released in the cell environment.14,18 Another method consists of grafting a polymer layer at the surface
of SPIONs to enhance their stealth properties in the body11,19−21 or to combine the magnetic properties of the core
and polymer chain physicochemical properties to elaborate responsive
NPs that exhibit high potential as drug carriers for cancer therapy.12,22,23 The previously described strategy
leads to very promising nanomaterials especially for cancer therapy
by combining imaging and drug release properties. However, the synthetic
processes developed to obtain such NPs are time-consuming, and for
the more sophisticated ones, the ease of implementation required by
industries is hindered.

To overcome the synthetic process limitations,
the layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembly of charged molecules has shown interesting features.24 This method consists of the alternative adsorption
of charge macromolecules (mainly polyelectrolytes) onto surfaces.24 It has been shown three decades ago that the
process can be versatile, controlled at the nanometer scale, and could
eventually lead to structured surfaces with high potential for biological
applications.25

To the best of our
knowledge, the LbL process is usually used for
the encapsulation of drugs,26−30 beds,31,32 silica nanostructures,33−35 or iron oxide
NPs,26,36−38 but the synthesis of
core/shell NPs was rarely reported.13,39−42 Palomec-Garfias et al. synthesized magnetic core/shell NPs composed
of a γ-Fe2O3 core on which were layer-by-layer
assembled poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) followed by either poly(allylamine
hydrochloride) (PAH) or chitosan (Chi).13 The authors have focused their studies on the influence of the pH
on the shell shape, which is directly related to the pH-responsive
behavior of the PAH or Chi, which are weak polyelectrolytes.43 However, the influence of the polyelectrolyte
multilayer films on the magnetic properties was not evidenced. In
another work devoted to biomedical applications, Mancarella et al.
have assembled on Fe3−δO4 surfaces
biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, that is, poly-l-lysine and dextran, to obtain magnetic curcuma nanocarriers. The
curcuma loading and release were monitored, and its triggering by
the degradation of the polymer in physiological media was demonstrated.39 When the curcuma-loaded NPs were made in contact
with SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells, an increase in cell death of about
10% after 48 h of incubation was observed compared to the nude Fe3−δO4 NPs.

When the LbL is conducted
on flat surfaces, the complete characterization
of the multilayered film can be conducted in terms of thickness and
organization by different techniques ranging from the UV–visible
absorption measurements to X-ray and neutron reflectivity,24 which gave rise to a better understanding of
the film formation. All the experimental conclusions were associated
with theoretical studies to fully understand the mechanism of the
multilayered film formation depending on the macromolecule properties
(Mn, Ip, repetitive
unit chemical structure, charge degree).24 Concerning the adsorption of polyelectrolytes at the surface of
NPs, the full characterization of the nanostructure is still lacking
due to the spherical shape of the substrates. In this work, we have
first developed a process to functionalize magnetic NPs by synthetic
and well-described couples of polyelectrolytes:poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) (PSS/PDADMAC)n (n = number of bilayers) via the LbL process transposed to superparamagnetic
Fe3−δO4 NPs. After the optimization
of the LbL deposition at the NP surfaces, the core/shell NPs were
fully characterized, and the use of high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) evidenced the layered structure of the shell.
The influence of the shell thickness on the magnetization properties
of the NPs was also investigated. Finally, a cytotoxicity study was
conducted using the human monocytic THP-1 cell line, which is involved
in the defense against foreign bodies such as NPs. Results showed
that the core/shell NPs exhibit low cytotoxicity up to concentrations
of 25 μg mL–1 toward the THP-1 cell line.
The method developed to control the LbL assembly of PSS/PDADMAC on
the surface of Fe3−δO4 NPs could
pave the way for new nanoparticulate systems for biological applications.

Results
and Discussion
To study the efficiency of the LbL assembly
of polyelectrolytes
at the surface of the Fe3−δO4@NH3+, we have combined complementary characterization
methods to study the microstructures of the core/shell NPs and their
colloidal stability after the LbL assembly of PSS and PDADMAC (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium
chloride) (PDADMAC).

Core/Shell NP Microstructure
To ensure that the process
does not damage the crystallinity of the NP core, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) experiments were performed. The characteristic diffraction peaks
at 2θ = 30.10, 35.60, 43.14, 53.49, 57.11, and 62.88° remain
unchanged after the functionalization process and match with the characteristic
diffraction (220), (311), (400), (422), (511), and (440) planes of
the magnetite Fe3O4 phase (JCPDS PDF No. 00-019-0629)
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

High-resolution TEM micrographs show the spherical shape of Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs
(Figure 2). The core
displays an average diameter of 10 ± 1.5 nm as determined from
TEM images (Figure 2c). The diameter range size of these NPs is well compatible with
the expected superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature.47

To study the influence of the shell on the physical
and colloidal
properties of the core/shell NPs and on their cytotoxicity, the coverage
of the core by the polyelectrolyte film is necessary. To demonstrate
the efficiency of our process, Energy-Filtered TEM analyses were conducted,
and an amorphous layer essentially composed of carbon (see the C mapping, Figure 3c) at the surface
and at the interspace between particles was observed (Figure 3a–c). The C mapping
(carbon is essentially derived from the polyelectrolyte multilayered
film) demonstrates that the LbL process enables a full and homogeneous
coverage of the core/shell NPs by the polyelectrolytes. Moreover,
HR-TEM images show the layered nanostructuration of the (PSS/PDADMAC)6 film as can be seen in the inset of Figure 3d. A final thickness of the polyelectrolyte
multilayered film after 6 deposition cycles of about 2.2 nm was calculated
from HR-TEM images, which is close to the thickness determined when
the process is conducted on flat surfaces.25 This indicates that the curvature of the surface does not have an
impact on the LbL process.

The toxicity of NPs relies on different factors such as size, surface
charge, composition, impurities, and specific surface area.7,48 NP size plays a key role as it affects their uptake by cells, their
interaction with organelles, the death mechanism, and their clearance.
Indeed, when considering cancer therapeutic nanosystems, it has been
shown that NPs have to display sizes between 10 and 200 nm to accumulate
into tumors while avoiding healthy tissues owing to their enhanced
permeability and retention effect.22,49

The
average hydrodynamic diameters (DH) of
NPs were measured at each two adsorbed (PSS/PDADMAC) bilayers
by dynamic light scattering (DLS) as presented in Figure 4. As expected, the NP hydrodynamic
diameters increase with the number of bilayers; that is, Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)2, Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)4, and Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 display diameters of 35,
75, and 120 nm, respectively. The increase in capsule shell thickness
after the deposition of six PDADMAC/PSS bilayers is ∼50 nm,
a value that is in good agreement with the data related to the thickness
of polyelectrolyte layers adsorbed onto a latex particle determined
by single-particle light scattering.9,16 Due to their
sizes varying between 35 and 120 nm, Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC) NPs are well suited for antitumor treatment.50,51,54,55

Figure 4 Hydrodynamic
diameter of (PSS/PDADMAC)-modified Fe3−δO4 NPs dispersed in water determined by DLS.

Iron oxide NPs with diameters below 50 nm exhibit almost
no cytotoxity,48 like ferumoxytol, which
is already FDA-approved
as an iron supplement. As previously indicated, the surface charge
and its density influence the NP toxicity.52 It has been shown that positively charged particles underwent better
cell uptake than negatively charged ones (cationic iron oxide NPs
can be more easily ingested by macrophages more easily than anionic
ones).

The LbL process is well known to conduct a charge inversion
of
the substrate at each deposited layer on flat surfaces53 and will thus lead to changes of NP surface
charge. The ζ potential of positively charged Fe3−δO4@NH3+ NPs at pH 4 is +25 mV (Figure 5). When adding the
first layer of PSS, the ζ potential becomes negative and reaches
−27 mV, confirming the successful adsorption of the polyanion.
The PDADMAC polycation was subsequently assembled onto the negatively
charged NPs and leads to the charge inversion of the polarity to +40
mV. As shown in Figure 5, alternating the polycation and polyanion layers induces ζ
potential oscillation between negative and positive values. The high
ζ potential values (up to 40 mV) combined to the HR-TEM measurement,
which are close to the thickness measured for the polyelectrolyte
layer on their stretched conformation, indicate that the polymer chains
keep their complete stretched conformation while assembling on the
NP surface. These characteristics make these NPs good candidates for
drug or gene delivery for cancer therapy.

Magnetic Measurements
The magnetic properties of the
Fe3−δO4 SPIONs and of the Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)n NPs were evaluated at 5 and 300 K (Figure 6). Superparamagnetic behavior of the Fe3O4 SPIONs was observed at 300 K with a saturation
magnetization around 70 emu/g. At 5 K, a hysteresis cycle can be observed
due to the transition to a low-temperature blocked state, with a saturation
magnetization of 80 emu/g and a coercive field around 270 Oe.

curves of (a) Fe3−δO4 at 5 and
300 K and (b) Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)n superparamagnetic
NPs.

The saturated magnetization values
(per gram of Fe3−δO4 content) of
Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)2, Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)4, and Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs are 40, 20, and
9 emu g–1, respectively. These values are lower
than those of the native Fe3−δO4@NH2 NPs (60 emu g–1) (Figure 6b). This originates from a
decrease in the magnetic interaction due to the diamagnetic coating
according to previous reports.3,9 Nevertheless, the NPs
quickly interact with a magnet (Figure 7). The remanence (Mr) and
coercivity (Hc) for Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC) NPs were close to zero, which is typical
for superparamagnetic NPs.17,18

Figure 7 Magnetic separation of
Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs dispersed in water (a) without a magnet
and (b) in contact with a magnet.

To confirm the superparamagnetic behavior of NPs, field-cooling
(FC) and zero-field-cooling (ZFC) experiments were performed. The
magnetization-dependent temperature was studied at an applied field
of 75 Oe in the temperature range between 5 and 400 K (the graphs
are depicted in the Supporting Information). The gradual increase of the magnetization for the ZFC and FC curves
until their intersection at the blocking temperature (TB) is linked to the progressive rotation of the magnetization
of the blocked magnetic NPs toward the field direction.56 Above TB, the magnetization
curve slope was inverse, which indicates the free alignment of the
NPs with the magnetic field during the measurement. It is worthy to
mention that this blocking temperature at 270 K (around −3
°C) is higher than that reported for other iron oxide NPs with
close sizes, which suggested that the NPs can be slightly aggregated
in the media (Figure S3). Indeed, the presence
of dipolar interactions can induce a shift of TB toward higher temperatures.3,10 Nevertheless,
this specific behavior is the fingerprint of superparamagnetism. Moreover,
above TB, the core/shell NPs are superparamagnetic,
the Fe3−δO4 SPIONs display then
superparamagnetic behavior at the room temperature.

The magnetic
separation and redispersion process of Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs is illustrated in Figure 7. The black particles
were readily attracted to the bottom of the flask within 10 s by the
magnet, and the color of the Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 solution quickly turned from black to
transparent. The particles can be well dispersed again by stirring
and ultrasonic vibration.

To envision the applications of these
NPs in biological application,
cytotoxicity studies were carried out toward THP-1 cells.

Cytotoxicity
Study
THP-1 cells are well known to induce
an inflammatory reaction when exposed to a drug.57,58 To evaluate the toxicity of the NPs toward THP-1 cells, cytotoxicity
studies of Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs were conducted by the conventional WST-1 assays. Figure 8 displays the THP-1
viability results after 5 and 24 h of exposure to NPs. Cytotoxicity
appears only at 50 μg mL–1 and higher doses,
and the inhibitory concentration IC50 calculated at 24
h was higher than 100 μg mL–1. This result
suggests that iron oxide NP toxicity is low on THP-1 cells and that
their induced inflammatory response is limited.57 According to our results, cell death was less important
at 24 h. It may be linked to a mechanism of cell adaptation or to
the aggregation of NPs after 24 h, which mitigate their toxicity.
However, the cell death observed at high concentrations may originate
from the release of reactive oxygen species, which will induce mitochondrial
dysfunctions leading to an increase of the swelling and cell permeability
and finally to DNA damage.59,60 However, these NPs
still exhibit a favorable low cytotoxicity, which makes them of high
interest for biomedical applications.

h of exposure to Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)6 NPs.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have provided a novel simple method to encapsulate
Fe3−δO4 SPIONs by using the LbL
approach. The shell construction was followed at each step of the
multilayered film formation. The cytotoxic tests toward human cancer
THP-1 cells of the core/shell NPs showed that these functional nanomaterials
exhibited almost no toxicity at concentrations up to 25 μg mL–1. The techniques reported in this work could be transposed
to the LBL of biobased macromolecules like poly-l-lysine
and hyaluronic acid for its well-known targeting properties. This
work paves the way for the elaboration of new core/shell NPs with
promising biomedical properties.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
except for (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (Gelest, >95%), poly(sodium
4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)
(PDADMAC), and were used as received.

Synthesis of Fe3−δO4 SPIONs
A coprecipitation method was used to
synthesize the superparamagnetic
Fe3−δO4 nanocrystals. 5 mL of a
28% (v/v) aqueous ammonia solution was added to 40 mL of an aqueous
mixture of FeCl3·6H2O (6 mmol; 1.622 g)
and FeSO4·7H2O (5 mmol; 1.39 g). The mixture
was stirred and heated at 90 °C under an argon atmosphere.18 To stabilize the NPs, 15 mL of a 1 M solution
of sodium citrate (chosen as the ligand) was added dropwise, and the
mixture was stirred for 30 min. The final solution turned black. The
SPIONs were recovered by magnetic separation and washed several times
with ethanol to remove the unreacted reagents.

Synthesis of (3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane-Coated
Fe3−δO4 NPs (Fe3−δO4@NH2)
(3-Aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane
(0.2 mmol, 49.1
μL) was injected to 10 mL of a homogeneous oxygen-free solution
of Fe3−δO4 SPIONs (50 mg). After
stirring the solution for 2 min, 1 mL of an ethanolic solution of
tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate (TMAH) (0.2 M) was added,
and the mixture was further stirred under argon for 15 min at 50 °C.
The mixture was then cooled, and Fe3−δO4 SPIONs were separated by centrifugation and washed two times
with toluene. After the dispersion of the silanized Fe3−δO4 SPIONs in 10 mL of toluene, 2 mL of an ethanolic solution
of TMAH (36.25 mg) was injected in the media. The mixture was stirred
under argon pressure for 30 min at 50 °C. Afterward, the reactor
was cooled in a water bath, and Fe3−δO4 SPIONs were separated by centrifugation and washed two times
with toluene.44

Synthesis of Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)
NPs
After the silanization step, Fe3−δO4@NH2 SPIONs were obtained. Because the layer-by-layer
assembly is mainly driven by electrostatic interactions, the pH of
the Fe3−δO4@NH2 solution
was adjusted to 4 in order to have a highly positively charged surface
(Fe3−δO4@NH3+). The LbL process could then be conducted as follows: the Fe3−δO4@NH3+ NPs
were stirred for 10 min in 10 mL of 10–2 M solution
of PSS followed by ultracentrifugation. The as-synthesized Fe3−δO4@PSS was redispersed in Milli-Q
water, stirred for 5 min to remove the physisorbed molecules, and
ultracentrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The rinsing process
was repeated three times. Afterward, the solution of the negatively
charged Fe3−δO4@PSS NPs was dispersed
in 10 mL of PDADMAC, and the mixture was also stirred for 10 min,
ultracentrifuged, and washed three times following the same process
as presented below. The sample is then named Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)1 (the subscript 1 indicates
that one bilayer of PSS/PDADMAC is deposited at the surface of the
Fe3−δO4@NH3+). This process was repeated as many times as the desired number
of bilayers (PSS/PDADMAC) was reached, which led to Fe3−δO4@(PSS/PDADMAC)n, where n is the number of bilayers in the shell.

Characterization
DLS was performed at room temperature
using a Malvern Zetasizer HSa instrument with a He–Ne laser
(4 × 10–3 W) at a wavelength of 633 nm. NP
aqueous solutions were filtered through Millipore membranes (0.2 mm
pore size). Data were analyzed by the CONTIN method to obtain the
hydrodynamic diameter and size distribution for each aqueous dispersion
of NPs. The crystallographic structure of the NPs was identified by
XRD using a Philips PW3710 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation.
For TEM observations, one drop of a dispersed solution of NPs was
deposited on holey carbon grids and imaged. A transmission electron
microscope used was a JEM - ARM 200F Cold FEG TEM/STEM operating at
200 kV and equipped with a spherical aberration (Cs) probe and image
correctors. The magnetic properties of the core/shell NPs were studied
by a superconducting quantum interference device SQUID-VSM combined
to a vibrating sample magnetometer.

Biological Characterization
Cell
Culture
The THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell
line (ATCC CRL2192; Manassas; USA) was grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium high-glucose (DMEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
USA) medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin–streptomycin
,2% l-glutamine, and 0.25 μg mL–1 amphotericin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA). Cells were grown
at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere and were passed
every 3 days.

Cell Treatment
Cells were seeded
in 96 well plates
with 5 × 103 cells per well. After overnight incubation,
plates were centrifuged (800 × g, 10 min), and
the medium with FBS was removed. A fresh medium without FBS and with
0, 1.5, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μg mL–1 each CNM was added, and cells were incubated for 24 and 72 h. Six
wells were used per culture condition, and experiments were repeated
four times.

WST-1 Assay
The tetrazolium salt
2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt, better known as WST-1 (Roche;
Boulogne; France), was used to measure cell viability by detecting
the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity as previously described.45 Briefly, after treatment, 5 μL of WST-1
was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured
at 450 nm with a reference wavelength of 690 nm, using an iMarK Microplate
Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Osaka, Japan). Inhibitory concentration
IC50 was calculated by the Reed–Muench formula.46

diffraction peaks at
2θ = 30.10, 35.60, 43.14, 53.49, 57.11, and 62.88° at each
step of the functionalization process, confirming that the process
used for the LbL deposition of the polyelectrolyte did not alter the
crystalline structure of the core of the nanoparticles (Figure S1).
The complete dispersion of the polyelectrolyte functional nanoparticulate
system was confirmed by DLS measurement, and the size (and its polydispersity
via the PDI) is illustrated (Figure S2). The superparamagnetic behavior
of the NPs was confirmed by ZF-ZFC measurements of NPs at each step
of modification. The blocking temperature found to be 270 K (around
−3 °C) is higher than those reported for other iron oxide
NPs with close sizes, which suggested that the NPs can be slightly
aggregated in the physiological media (Figure S3) (PDF)
