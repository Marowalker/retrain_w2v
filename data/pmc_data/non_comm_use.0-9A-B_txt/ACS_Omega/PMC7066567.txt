This study aims to explore the mechanism
under which ash deposition
propensity is improved by coal blending in a real modern boiler situation.
In this paper, Zhundong coal (ZD), from northwestern China, known
to have a heavy ash deposition problem in boilers, was blended with
Jincheng anthracite (JC), which has a high ash fusion temperature
(AFT). The density composition of the coal blend, which reflects the
mineral distribution in pulverized coals, was found to change during
the intergrinding process. The higher rank coal JC was found to be
more concentrated in its lower and highest density fractions. The
variances in the chemical composition among density fractions in the
pulverized coal blend were found greatly narrowed as compared with
the parent coals. AFT results indicate that the ash melting behavior
in the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) varies with density, which is confirmed
by corresponding slag contents calculated with FactSage 7.1. Particle
size distributions of the density fractions in ZD, JC, and the coal
blend were determined with a laser particle analyzer. The size distribution
of ash particles in each density fraction was estimated according
to the char morphology, which is deduced from the ash content and
coal particle size distribution. Minerals in the lowest density fractions
will form ash with a particle size of around 2 μm. Included
minerals in the medium density fractions will form ash particles with
size related to its ash content, and excluded minerals will undergo
slight fragmentation and have a ash particle size similar to the corresponding
coal particles. A comprehensive comparison between ash volume, ash
particle size, and softening temperature indicates that ash deposition
propensity of the coal blend is improved not only because of an apparent
increase in AFT but also because of an apparent decrease in the total
volume of ash particles possibly arriving on the deposition surface.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Although new energy sources
(e.g., solar energy, wind energy, biomass
energy etc.) are developing rapidly in China, coal is still and will
continue to be its main energy source.1 With persistent high speed economic development, the coal reserves
near heavily populated areas are nearly depleted. Zhundong coalfield
with a reserve of 39 Gt was explored in the Xinjiang province in northwestern
China in 2005. It is expected to be its major energy source in the
future.2,3 As the Xinjiang province is more than 3000
Km away from the relatively developed areas of southeast China, the
coal is preferably converted to electricity or gas, which can be transported
more economically.

The low rank Zhundong coal (ZD) is regarded
as a high quality coal
for power generation, as it is characterized by its high volatile
matter (in general higher than 30 wt %) and low contents of ash (typically
at 3–6 wt %) and sulfur (less than 0.5 wt %).2,3 However, its severe ash slagging problem in the radiant heat transfer
section and fouling problem in the convective heat transfer section
observed in power plants, limit its utilization. To mitigate its ash
deposition problem, many methods (e.g., leaching, preheating, admixtures
etc.) were proposed, in which coal blending is the most economical
and thus currently practiced.2−6

Although there are many methods (e.g., thermo-mechanical analysis,
pressure-drop technique, deposition probe, etc.) to predict ash deposition
propensity in utility boilers burning solid fuels, such as coal, biomass,
or coal blends, ash fusion temperature (AFT) is most widely employed
in labs and power plants.7−9 It is determined by preparing
a pyramid with 1 g of ash, which is then heated and observed in a
tube furnace under a weakly reducing atmosphere. Four characteristic
temperatures, that is, deformation temperature (DT), softening temperature
(ST), hemisphere temperature (HT), and flow temperature (FT), can
be determined and used to reflect a basic ash melting characteristics.
However, many authors noticed that AFT may not accurately predict
coal performance in a real modern boiler situation.10,11 The problem with AFT mainly results from the fact that it is related
to the bulk chemistry and the bulk AFTs. It fails to address the heterogeneous
nature of ash properties from particle to particle in pulverized coal
combustion in a real modern boiler.12

A computer-controlled scanning electron microscope (CCSEM) analysis
can provide very useful details and insight in the heterogeneity of
solid fuels.12,13 Three types of particles, that
is, pure organic particles, organic particles with included minerals,
and excluded minerals are characterized in pulverized coals. CCSEM
provides information on the form (included or excluded), chemical
composition, and size distribution of minerals. However, there are
some limitations and disadvantages when using CCSEM techniques.12,13 In order to obtain statistically meaningful and quantitative results,
a sufficiently high number of particles have to be analyzed. In addition,
particles in the sub-micrometer range (<2 μm) cannot be detected.
Furthermore, the mineral information determined with CCSEM on the
two-dimensional surface is not the three-dimensional reality. The
float-sink method is a simple tool to separate fine coal samples (<0.5
mm) into different density fractions, which is widely used in coal
preparation labs. It was also found to be an effective tool to quantitatively
characterize the proportions of included and excluded minerals.14,15 Zhang et al. used this method to determine an accurate distribution
of mineral matter in pulverized coals16 and to study the influence of included minerals on the structure
and intrinsic reactivity of pulverized coal chars.17

Ash deposition in a real modern boiler situation
is complicated.
With the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in solid
fuel combustion simulations, a panoramic view of ash deposition process
has been unfolded.13,18,19 When ash particles impact the heat transfer surfaces, only a few
particles will deposit on these surfaces. Several transport and deposition
mechanisms are responsible for the buildup of the ash deposit on heat
transfer surfaces. These mechanisms include thermophoresis, condensation,
inertial impaction, and chemical reactions. Inertial impaction is
considered as the most important mechanism that contributes significantly
to the ash deposition build-up process.13,18 The amount
of ash particles that may hit a depositing surface can be estimated
by particle impaction efficiency. For a certain boiler, factors, such
as particle velocity, gas temperature, the diameter of the deposition
pipe, and so forth, are set. The particle impaction efficiency mainly
depends on the size, density, and the proportion of the liquid phase
present in the ash particles. This method was used to study the ash
deposition mechanism during the combustion of pulverized ZD.20

Therefore, although AFT is widely used
in labs and power plants
in predicting ash deposition propensity, its accuracy between prediction
and reality needs to improve as it fails to address the heterogeneous
nature of minerals from particle to particle. CFD studies indicate
that inertial impaction is the most important mechanism that contributes
significantly to the ash deposition build-up process, which mainly
depends on the size, density, and the proportion of the liquid phase
of the ash particles. The present work studies the volume, composition,
and size distribution of minerals as well as AFT in ZD and its coal
blend, so as to predict ash deposition propensity more accurately
than the traditional AFT in a real modern boiler. This mechanism can
also be applied to develop a new criterion to predict ash deposition
propensity in pulverized coal boilers for all coals.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Coal Blending
on Their Density and
Chemical Composition
For pulverized coals, coal particles
can be divided into three categories, that is, pure organic particles,
organic particles with included minerals, and excluded minerals, which
can be reflected by density.16 The two
parent coals and the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) were separated into
density fractions from 1.3 to 2.0 g/cm3 with the traditional
float-sink method. Their density composition and ash content of the
two parent coals are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Density composition and ash content of pulverized ZD and
JC coal
samples.

From Figure 1, the
density fractions in pulverized ZD sample can be divided into three
types according to their ash content. The three fractions with densities
<1.6 g/cm3 have ash contents less than 6.15%. They are
predominantly organic particles. As their minerals cannot be observed
under a microscope or SEM as they are finely distributed in the organic
matrix,21 they are called organic particles.
The two heaviest fractions have ash contents higher than 90.14%, which
can be taken as excluded minerals. The 1.6–1.7 g/cm3 fraction represents organic particles with included minerals. According
to their type and yield, pulverized ZD coal sample was separated into
three density fractions, that is, <1.6, 1.6–1.7, and >1.7
g/cm3 for further study. They are abbreviated as ZD16,
ZD1617, and ZD17, respectively.

For the pulverized JC sample,
the two fractions with densities
<1.6 g/cm3 have ash contents less than 7.86%, representing
organic particles. The fraction with a density >2.0 g/cm3 has an ash content of 68.98%, representing the excluded minerals.
The three fractions between 1.6 and 2.0 g/cm3 have ash
contents between 12.69 and 33.23%, indicating that they are organic
particles with included minerals. For further study, the pulverized
JC coal sample was separated into four density fractions, that is,
<1.6, 1.6–1.7, 1.7–2.0, and >2.0 g/cm3. They are abbreviated as IC16, JC1617, JC1720, and JC20, respectively.

The drastic difference in the density composition between pulverized
ZD and JC samples can be attributed to their rank difference. Zhang
et al.21 found that with the decrease of
rank, the organic part and the mineral matter in a coal tend to be
loosely intertwined, resulting in higher separation of the organic
part and the inorganic part during the grinding process.

The
density composition and corresponding ash contents for the
coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) are shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Density composition and their ash contents of
the coal blend (ZD/JC
= 50:50).

For Figure 2, it
can be found that for the coal blend, its density distribution looks
more like ZD sample, but the corresponding ash content distribution
more like JC sample. For further study, it was separated into four
density fractions, that is, <1.6, 1.6–1.7, 1.7–1.8,
and >1.8 g/cm3 with ash contents <9.79, 26.76, 67.99,
and 82.72%, respectively. They are abbreviated as B16, B1617, B1718,
and B18, respectively.

Interesting phenomenon was found when
the change of volatile contents
with density was compared with their calculated weight-averaged results
in the coal blend, as is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Change of actual volatile contents and their
calculated weight-averaged
results with density in the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50).

The weight-averaged results were calculated by multiplying
the
volatile content of each density fraction with corresponding density
content in the parent coals from Figure 1, and with their blending ratio 50:50 in
the coal blend, assuming no change in the density composition during
the intergrinding process. From Figure 3, it can be found that the practical volatile contents
in the two <1.5 g/cm3 fractions are both much lower
than the calculated weight-averaged results. As the parent coal ZD
has a much higher content of volatile matter than the parent coal
JC, it can be deduced that JC is more concentrated in <1.5 g/cm3 fractions in the coal blend. In contrast, the two density
fractions between 1.5 and 1.7 g/cm3, their volatile contents
are higher than the calculated results, which implie that ZD is more
concentrated in these medium density fractions in the coal blend.
This phenomenon implies that the density composition or mineral matter
distribution was changed during the intergrinding process of coal
blends as compared with single coals. As compared with JC, ZD has
a much lower Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) value. When they are
ground together, ZD acts as a grinding aid to accelerate the separation
of the mineral matter from organic-minerals intertwined particles
in JC. Thus, the mineral matter in JC will be more thoroughly separated
from the organic matter, which explains the change of density composition
of the coal blend.21

The chemical
compositions of the density fractions of ZD, JC, and
the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) were analyzed with X-ray fluorescence
(XRF). The basic to acid (B/A) ratios were also calculated as they
can reflect ash fusion tendency. The results are shown in Table 1.

From Table 1, it
can be found that the chemical compositions are highly different among
their density fractions in all the pulverized coals. For the pulverized
ZD sample, CaO, MgO, and SO3 are highly concentrated in
<1.6 g/cm3, the lowest density fraction. CaO attains
to surprisingly 28.03%, in contrast to only around 4% in the other
two density fractions. It may look strange that CaO is concentrated
in the organic fraction. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated
that there are high contents of calcite and anhydrate in its ash prepared
under 450 °C.22 The maceral composition
of coal can be divided into vitrinite, inertrinite, exinite, and mineral.
Mineral matter tends to be concentrated in inertinite, as inertinite
is highly porous as compared with other organic maceral constituents.
Usually, coal in China contains the highest amount of vitrinite and
then inertinite and exinite.23 In contrast,
ZD consists of 80% inertrinite.24 Pores
in the inertrinite of ZD provide the best place for the precipitation
of CaCO3.

For the other pulverized parent coal JC,
a similar chemical composition
can be found in the three density fractions other than >2.0 g/cm3, the highest density fraction. The content of Fe2O3 in the highest density fraction attains 17.28%, in
contrast to around 5% in the other three density fractions. Petrographic
observation indicates that pyrite is concentrated in the highest density
fraction.

As compared with parent coal ZD and JC, the variations
in the ash
chemical compositions among the density fractions of the coal blend
are greatly decreased. For sample ZD, the variances of SiO2 and CaO among the density fractions are 34 and 24%, respectively.
For sample JC, the variances of Al2O3 and Fe2O3 are both close to 12%. For the coal blend, the
variances of SiO2, CaO, Al2O3, and
Fe2O3 are narrowed to 10, 6.5, 7.5, and 2.6%,
respectively. Apparently, this phenomena result from the change of
density composition of the coal blend.

2.2 Ash Melting
Behaviors of Blended Coals and
the Density Fractions of Coal Blend
2.2.1 Influence
of Blending Ratio on the AFTs
of Coal Blends
The influence of the blending ratio of ZD
to JC on the AFTs of blended coals is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Influence of blending ratio on AFTs of the coal
blends.

From Figure 4, it
can be found that with the increase of JC proportion, the coal blend
has higher AFT, which implies that ash deposition performance of blend
coals will be improved as compared with the parent coal ZD. ZD has
an ST only 1180 °C. According to empirical knowledge, it will
have a serious ash deposition problem. When blended with JC, ST of
the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) is increased to 1280 °C. Thus,
an apparent improvement in deposition can be expected. It should be
noted that the increase in AFT is not in a linear relationship with
a blending ratio, which was also observed by many other authors.3,25 AFT’s are nonadditive for coal blends, as AFT is determined
by the chemical composition of the ash in coal blends, rather than
by the blending ratio.

2.2.2 Ash Melting Behavior
of the Density Fractions
of the Coal Blend
In this part, the ash melting behaviors
of the density fractions in the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) were studied
with AFT and FactSage. The AFTs of the density fractions of the coal
blend are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 AFTs of the density fractions in the coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50).

In Figure 5, it
is shown that the AFTs of the coal blend were differentiated according
to their density. ST, the softening temperature, is also used here
as an index to explain the changes. The <1.6 g/cm3 fraction,
representing organic particles with little mineral matter, has the
highest ST, 1300 °C. With the increase of density, its ST is
decreasing. A sharp decrease of 40 °C can be found from <1.6
g/cm3 fraction to 1.6–1.7 g/cm3. The
>1.8 g/cm3 fraction, representing the excluded minerals,
has an ST of 1250 °C. The range of ST among the different density
fractions in the coal blend is 50 °C.

The slag contents,
or liquid contents, in the melt of the four
density fractions of the coal blend between 900 and 1500 °C at
equilibrium were calculated with FactSage 7.1. The chemical composition
in Table 4 was input
into the model for multiphase equilibrium prediction. The results
are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Liquid contents in the melt of the four density fractions of the
coal blend between 900 and 1500 °C.

From Figure 6, it
can be found that the ash melting behavior, reflected by liquid content,
of each density fraction in the coal blend was differentiated too.
The <1.6 g/cm3 fraction has a much lower liquid content
under equal temperature or a much higher temperature at equal liquid
content. The other three density fractions have similar liquid contents
with a 1.6–1.7 g/cm3 fraction a little bit more
difficult to melt. These results coincide well with the AFT results
shown in Figure 5,
which imply that the difference in ash melting behavior of the density
fractions of the coal blend results from their change in the chemical
composition.

It should be noted that there is a slight difference
between the
liquid content calculated with FactSage and the AFT determined. In
the calculation, all major components determined with XRF, that is,
SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, MgO, SO3, TiO2, Na2O, and K2O, have been involved. Minor constituents, such
as Cl, P2O5, BaO, MnO, and so forth, were neglected,
so as not to be involved in a complicated situation.26

2.3 Size Distributions of Coal
Particles in Different
Density Fractions of the Parent Coals and the Coal Blend
In a real modern boiler situation, deposition is influenced by the
ash particle size besides other factors, which will be discussed in
the next part. In this part, the size distributions of coal particles
in the density fractions of ZD, JC, and their coal blend (ZD/JC =
50:50) were studied and their ash particle sizes were estimated.

Ash formation in a real boiler situation is complicated. Excluded
mineral and included mineral behave differently.13,15,27 In excluded minerals, pyrite will oxidize
into Fe2O3 and fragment into many much smaller
particles, while quartz will keep unchanged under thermal stresses.
Calcite, kaolinite particles will undergo decomposition and may fragment
into several smaller particles. The behavior of included mineral is
more complex. Typically, three different char types can be formed
during de-volatilization, the first stage of combustion.13,15,28 Type I chars are spherical to
sub-spherical particles with thin walls (<5 μm) and high
porosity values, so-called cenospheres. Type II particles show a sub-spherical
shape with medium porosity, almost no swelling and variable wall thicknesses.
Moreover type III chars, which are relatively dense, have an angular
shape and a swelling coefficient smaller than unity. Char type I will
fragment into individual ash particles, close to no coalescence. Char
type III will agglomerate into coarse ash particles, close to full
coalescence. The minerals within Char type II will partially agglomerate.

In this research, particle size distributions of the parent coals
and their coal blend (ZD/JC = 50:50) were analyzed with a laser particle
analyzer. The results are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Size distribution of coal particles in the density
fractions of
sample ZD, JC, and the coal blend.

It is shown in Figure 7 that for the pulverized ZD samples, the coal particles in
the <1.6 g/cm3 fraction (organic particles) and the
>1.8 g/cm3 fraction (excluded minerals) are both apparently
coarser than the 1.6–1.7 g/cm3 fraction. For the
pulverized JC samples, the <1.6 g/cm3 fraction (organic
particles) is the coarsest. The >2.0 g/cm3 fraction
(excluded
minerals) is the second coarsest fraction. The two-medium density
fractions (with included minerals) are much finer than the above two
fractions.

The ash particle size distribution of the two parent
coals in a
real modern boiler situation can be estimated according to the ash
formation mechanism.13,28 For <1.6 g/cm3 fraction
in ZD and JC, type I chars will be formed during the first stage of
combustion. With the oxidation of these char particles, the minerals
within will fragment into individual fine ash particles, around 1–3
μm in diameter. For the minerals in the two >1.6 g/cm3 fractions in ZD with a ash content higher than 72%, they
will coalesce
with each other to form one ash drop for each mineral particle as
they have an ST only 1180 °C, which is much lower than the combustion
temperature in a real boiler. Their ash particle size distribution
should be close to the corresponding coal particles. For the excluded
minerals in a >2.0 g/cm3 fraction of JC, only FeS2 will fragment into smaller particles. The other excluded
minerals
will undergo slight fragmentation. Similar ash particle size can be
expected from this density fraction in a real boiler. For the other
two density fractions between 1.6 and 2.0 g/cm3 in JC samples,
type II char will be formed. However, they do not seem to coalesce
as they have ST around 1550 °C, higher than the furnace temperature.
They may disintegrate into much smaller independent ash particles.

For the pulverized coal blend samples shown in Figure 7, the coal particle size distribution
for each density fraction is greatly changed as compared with the
parent ZD samples. Coal particles in the <1.6 g/cm3 (organic
particles) and >1.8 g/cm3 (excluded minerals) fractions
are much coarser than the other two medium density fractions (with
included minerals). Just as-discussed above, very fine ash particles
will be formed from a >1.6 g/cm3 fraction. The ash formed
from a >1.8 g/cm3 fraction will have a similar particle
size as its coal fraction, assuming a full coalescence. As to the
1.6–1.7 and 1.6–1.8 g/cm3 fractions, each
coal particle will shrink into smaller ash particles during burnout,
as they have ash content only 26.76 and 67.99%, respectively, even
assuming a full coalescence.

2.4 Comprehensive Discussion
on the Influence
of the Mineral Distribution in Coal Blend on Ash Deposition Propensity
in Boilers
Ash deposition in a real boiler situation is complicated.
Numerous ash deposition models were proposed.13 It is now widely agreed that the ash deposition rate is determined
by a sum of four independent rates, inertial impaction, thermophoresis, condensation,
and chemical reaction.13,18−20 Inertial impaction
is the dominant deposition mechanism in most cases. Because of the
influence of the gas flow, not all the particles carried by the gas
stream will impact on the depositing surface. The impaction efficiency
is dependent on the particle size, density, sticking ability, and
the aerodynamics of the gas. Given a certain boiler, gas aerodynamics
is fixed. Large particles with high density show much higher values
of arrival velocity than small particles with low density. Furthermore,
not all the arriving particles that reach a deposition surface will
stick to the surface. The stickiness of the ash particles plays a
critical role in the formation of ash deposit. ST in the four characteristic
AFT temperatures of an ash is recognized as the temperature at which
the ash particle has a high tendency to stick to the deposition surface.11 Therefore, ash deposition is the result of the
combined effect of the volume, particle size, and ST of the incoming
ash.

In this study, the ash volume, estimated average particle
diameter, and ST of parent coal ZD and the coal blend are summarized
in Table 2.

Table 2 Ash Volume, Estimated Average Ash
Particle Diameter, and ST of ZD and the Coal Blend
sample	density fraction (kg/cm3)	ash content
in density fraction (wt %)	ash volume
in coal (wt %)	estimated
average ash particle diameter (μm)	ST (°C)	
ZD	<1.6	3.86	3.40	2	1240	
1.6–1.7	72.07	2.85	15	1190	
>1.7	91.65	7.49	20	1180	
 	 	 	 	 	 	
coal blend	<1.6	7.18	5.91	2	1300	
1.6–1.7	26.76	1.58	6	1260	
1.7–1.8	67.99	3.87	10	1250	
>1.8	82.72	4.95	46	1250	
From Table 2, it
can be found that when ZD is blended with JC, AFTs of all the density
fractions in the coal blend are increased 60–70 °C, which
will greatly decrease the sticking ability of ash particles on the
whole. It is the main effect of coal blending of ZD with JC.

Besides AFT, distributions of the ash and ash particle size in
density fractions are also changed, which determines the arriving
volume of ash particles on the deposition surface. The volume of the
finest ash particles around 2 μm from the organic coal particles
is increased from 3.40% in ZD to 5.91% in the coal blend. Coal particles
with included minerals in the coal blend are estimated to form ash
particles with an average size less than 10 μm, in contrast
to 15 μm in ZD. Particles with a diameter less than 10 μm
will flow with the gas stream and has little contribution to ash deposition.18 Although the size of excluded mineral particles
in the coal blend will form larger ash particles than ZD, its volume
is decreased from 7.49 to 4.95%. On the whole, the total possible
arriving volume of ash particles on the deposition surface will be
decreased from 10.14% in ZD to 4.95% in the coal blend.

Thus,
when low-rank ZD coal with a heavy ash deposition problem
is blended with anthracite JC with high AFT, ash deposition propensity
of the blended coal is improved not only because of an apparent increase
in AFT but also because of an apparent decrease in the total volume
of possible arriving ash particles on the deposition surface.

3 Conclusions
The present work systematically studied
the influence of coal blending
of low rank ZD with a heavy ash deposition problem with anthracite
Jincheng coal with high AFT on the state, chemical composition, ash
melting behavior, and particle size distribution of minerals in the
coal blend. Mineral distribution reflected with the density composition
was found changed in the coal blend during the intergrinding process.
JC is more concentrated in the lowest and highest density fractions,
which is attributed to its higher rank as compared with ZD. The variances
in the chemical composition among density fractions in the coal blend
were found highly narrowed as compared with its two parent coals.
AFT was found differentiated with density, which is well related to
its chemical composition calculated with FactSage.

Particle
size distribution of the density fractions in ZD, JC,
and coal blend (ZD/JC = 5050) was determined with a laser particle
analyzer. The size distribution of ash particles was estimated according
to the char morphology, which is deduced from the state of minerals
in pulverized coals. Minerals in the lowest density fractions will
form ash with an average particle size of around 2 μm. Included
minerals in the medium density fractions will form ash particles with
size related to its ash content. Excluded minerals will undergo slight
fragmentation and have a ash particle size similar to corresponding
coal particles.

A comprehensive comparison indicates that when
parent coal ZD is
blended with JC, ash deposition propensity of the coal blend is improved
not only because of an apparent increase in AFT but also because of
an apparent decrease in the total volume of possibly arriving ash
particles on the deposition surface.

This work provided a deep
understanding of ash deposition propensity
of pulverized blended coal as well as the pulverized single coal in
real modern boilers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Parent Coals
ZD was sampled in the
ZD field in the Xingjiang province in northwestern China. Jincheng
anthracite (JC) from the Shanxi province in China was chosen for the
preparation of coal blends for its high AFTs. Proximate and ultimate
analyses of the two parent coals are shown in Table 3. Their AFTs and chemical composition are
shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively.

4.2 Preparation of Coal Blends
and Their Density-Separated
Fractions
The two parent coals were crushed into lumps of
less than 3 mm and dried, respectively. They were then mixed in proportions
with weight ratios of ZD/JC at 100:0, 70:30, 50:50, 30:70, and 0:100,
respectively.

There may be two blending strategies for coal
blending, blending before or after coal grinding. Most authors chose
to grind parent coals separately and blend them after grinding, as
it is easy to operate in labs. However, such technology is scarcely
used in power plants, as it would be far more complicated and expensive.3,25 In this study, to simulate a practical coal preparation process
in power plants, blend-before-grinding technology was chosen.

The parent coals were weighed according to the experimental design.
They were then mixed and ground. The grounding time was regulated
according to specific samples so as to give similar fineness to an
industrial fineness control strategy, which is to pass a 125 μm
mess sieve with a residue around 10%. It should be noted that no part
of the samples was discarded.

All the pulverized coal samples
were separated into density fractions
from 1.3 to 2.0 g/cm3 with the traditional float-sink test
method as follows.16

Each sample
(60 g) was placed in four 250 mL plastic centrifuge
tubes and 100 mL of the heavy liquid was added to each tube. The tubes
were shaken by hand to ensure thorough dispersion of the sample particles
in the heavy liquid. Each sample was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm
for 10 min to reach complete float-sink separation. The solids in
the upper section of the tubes were transferred to be filtered and
then dried at 105 °C so as to get the light density fraction
of the sample. The heavy part in the bottom was added with heavier
liquids to repeat the former procedure to separate the next density
fraction. Mixtures of benzene/carbon tetra chloride and carbon tetra
chloride/bromoform provided densities in the range from 1.3 to 2.0
g/cm3.

4.3 Ash Fusion Behavior Study
Ash fusion
behavior was studied with AFT and FactSage calculation. AFTs were
measured using an AFT analyzer under a weakly reducing atmosphere
according to Chinese standard GB/T 219-2008. The weakly reducing atmosphere
was produced by placing some powered anthracite around ash pyramids
in the furnace. The four characteristic temperatures, namely, DT,
ST, HT, and FT, respectively, were determined by the change of ash
cones during heating from ambient temperature to 900 °C at a
rate of 15 °C/min and then to 1600 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min.

FactSage 7.1 was used to calculate the slag content of coal ash
at different temperatures under a reducing atmosphere.29 The reducing atmosphere of 60% CO2 and 40% CO was employed in the FactSage calculation. The temperatures
were set from 900 to 1500 °C at intervals of 50 °C. The
FactOxide and solid solution databases in the FactSage database were
selected for calculation.

4.4 Analysis Methods
XRF spectrometry
and laser particle size analyzer were employed to obtain further information
about the pulverized coal samples.

To analyze the ash chemical
composition, the coal samples were heated in a muffle furnace at 815
°C for 1 h under air atmosphere according to Chinese standard
GB/T1574-2011. The ash samples were analyzed with an X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry (S8 Tiger, Bruker, Germany).

The particle size
distribution of the pulverized coal samples were
analyzed with a laser particle analyzer (Beckman Coulter LS100Q, USA),
which is based on the principle of laser ensemble light scattering.
Each sample (0.5 g) was mixed with distilled water with a few drops
of alcohol to prevent agglomeration. It was then placed in an ultrasonic
bath for 3 min to destroy agglomeration before the particle size analysis
was completed.
