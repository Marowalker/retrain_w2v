Mesoporous
aluminum oxide (MAO) films with perpendicularly oriented
cylindrical mesopores (pore diameter: ca. 10 nm) were successfully
deposited on a glass substrate by a surfactant-templating approach
using aluminum nitrate as an aluminum source. The perpendicular orientation
of mesopores was confirmed by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray
scattering and neutron reflection experiments. The thickness of the
MAO film was around 100 nm, with a surface roughness of less than
6 nm. Since the inner surface of MAO pores was positively charged,
negatively charged glucose oxidase molecules could be densely loaded
into the cylindrical mesopores without significant loss of enzymatic
activity. The present MAO film is potentially useful as an inorganic
host material for an enzyme toward the development of a biocatalytic
system.

Introduction
Mesoporous silica,
which has a uniform pore structure and high
adsorption capacity, is a useful host material for biomacromolecules.1−5 Since the pore wall of mesoporous silica is negatively charged under
physiological conditions, biomacromolecules with a low isoelectric
point (pI) can be loaded into its pores. In contrast, the loading
of negatively charged biomacromolecules requires the modification
of the pore wall with amino silanes.6−9 Titanium oxide,10 titanium phosphate,11−13 and aluminum oxide14−18 have a high pI, and their rigid mesostructured framework
will provide a host space for negatively charged biomacromolecules
such as glucose oxidase (GOD).

Surfactant-templated mesoporous
materials with a high pI are commonly
synthesized by the hydrolysis of metal alkoxides.10−18 These materials have a uniform and ordered pore structure but their
pore sizes are usually smaller than the GOD molecule.10−16 GOD is an important oxidase for glucose sensors and has a molecule
that measures 5.4 nm × 6.7 nm × 7.4 nm (PDB ID, 1GAL). A mesopore size
of more than 8 nm is required for the pore loading of GOD molecules.

The surfactant-templated sol–gel method has also been applied
to deposit a mesoporous thin film on a solid substrate. The resulting
mesoporous film usually has a three-dimensional mesopore network or
cylindrical mesopore channels oriented parallel to the substrate surface.19 A perpendicularly oriented cylindrical mesopore
channel is favored to create an effective biocatalytic system with
an enzyme, but there has been no effective method to synthesize a
continuous mesoporous film with perpendicular mesochannels. Yamauchi
and co-workers succeeded in forming a continuous mesoporous aluminum
oxide (MAO) film composed of vertically oriented nanopillars by using
aluminum tri-n-butoxide as the aluminum source.17,18 However, it is expected that a biomacromolecule tightly confined
inside a cylindrical mesopore channel exhibits more enhanced stability
than that embedded between nanopillars.20,21 Recently,
Mou and co-workers reported a simple method to deposit a mesoporous
silica film with perpendicular nanochannels. The perpendicular silica-nanochannel
can be used for the confinement of positively charged protein molecules,
but the electrostatic repulsion between GOD and the silica surface
would reject the GOD confinement.22

Herein, we report the synthesis of a mesoporous aluminum oxide
(MAO) film by the surfactant-templated method using aluminum nitrate
as the metal precursor. The MAO film possesses a specific pore arrangement
that allows perpendicularly oriented cylindrical pore channels to
be aligned on a glass substrate. The pore size of the mesopore channel
is ca. 10 nm, which is sufficiently larger than the molecular dimensions
of GOD. GOD molecules can be highly loaded within the MAO film without
the loss of enzymatic activity.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Chemicals
A rectangular cover glass slip
(24 mm × 45 mm × 0.3 mm, Matsunami Glass Ind., Ltd., Osaka,
Japan) was used for the fabrication of the MAO film. Pluronic F127
(PEO106–PPO70–PEO106) and glucose oxidase (GOD) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Japan
(Tokyo, Japan). Aluminum nitrate and other chemicals were purchased
from Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp. (Osaka, Japan). Milli-Q water
was used for all experiments.

Synthesis and Characterization
of the MAO Film
We prepared
the MAO film on a glass substrate by using Pluronic F127 as a template
surfactant and aluminum nitrate as an aluminum seed. The cover glass
slip was sonicated in acetone and water for 5 min each. After drying,
the cover glass slip was heated in an oven at 500 °C to remove
organic adsorbates. Pluronic F127 (0.1 g) was dissolved in 2 mL of
distilled water containing aluminum nitrate (0.1–1.0 M), and
the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. This precursor
solution was spin-coated on the clean glass substrate at 600 rpm for
20 s, at an acceleration of 4000 rpm for 60 s. The spin coating was
performed under atmospheric conditions (25 °C). The glass substrate
was dried overnight at room temperature and then calcined at 500 °C
for 6 h in an ambient atmosphere. Hereinafter, we designate the glass
substrate with the MAO film as the MAO/glass substrate.

The
structural properties of MAO were characterized by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), neutron reflectometry, and
grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GI-SAXS). The SEM
image was measured on a Hitachi S4800. Neutron reflectivity experiments
were performed using the BL17 SHARAKU neutron reflectometer installed
in the Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility (MLF) at the
Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC).23 The incident beam power of the proton accelerator was 500
kW, and the neutron data were measured using the time-of-flight technique.
The wavelength (λ) range of the incident neutron beam was tuned
to approximately λ = 2.2–8.8 Å, and a Qz range of 0.008–0.09 Å–1 was covered, where Qz = (4π/λ)sin θ
(where θ represents the incident angle and is equal to 0.3 and
0.9°). All measurements were performed at room temperature. The
data were reduced, normalized, and subtracted using a program installed
on the BL17 SHARAKU. The Motofit program24 was used to fit the neutron reflection profiles using a least-squares
approach to minimize the deviation of the fit. The thickness, scattering
length density, and Gaussian roughness were also evaluated using the
Motofit program. GI-SAXS was measured on a Rigaku SmartLab HyPix-3000
system using Cu Kα radiation.

The surface charge on the
inner pore surface of the MAO film was
examined by observing the adsorption of fluorescein and methylene
blue. The MAO/glass substrate was immersed in an aqueous solution
containing 10 μM fluorescein and methylene blue overnight. After
rinsing with water, the transmission absorption spectrum of the MAO/glass
substrate was recorded on a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (JASCO, V570).

Measurement of Activity of GOD within the MAO Film
The MAO/glass
substrate was immersed in the GOD solution (1.0 mg/mL)
at 5 °C for 20 h. After rinsing with water, the amount of GOD
adsorbed at the MAO film was estimated by measuring the transmission
absorption spectrum. The MAO/glass substrate with GOD was then immersed
in 0.1 M N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.0) containing 150
mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 150 mM phenol, 0.03 g/mL peroxidase, and 0–10
mM glucose. The production of the red dye, a product of the enzymatic
reaction, was monitored by observing the time-course absorbance at
500 nm.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows typical
SEM images of the MAO film prepared with a precursor solution containing
0.5 M ammonium nitrate. Well-ordered pores with a pore diameter of
ca. 10 nm can be observed in the SEM top view (Figure 1A). As shown in the cross section of the
MAO film after cleavage (Figure 1B), the thickness of the MAO film is uniform (ca. 100
nm), and the pore channels appear to be oriented perpendicular to
the substrate surface. The cleavage by hand cannot produce a sharp
cleavage plane, and the pore structure was slightly broken. Although
the pore structure shown in the cross-sectional SEM view is not clear,
the appearance of a vertical structure suggests the perpendicularly
oriented cylindrical pore channels. A lower aluminum nitrate concentration
in the precursor solution resulted in a disordered pore structure
(Figure S1). The MAO film prepared with
the 0.5 M aluminum nitrate solution was therefore used for further
structural characterization.

Figure 1 Typical (A, B) top and (C) cross-sectional SEM
views of the MAO
film prepared with a precursor solution containing 0.5 M aluminum
nitrate.

Figure 2A shows
the neutron reflection spectrum obtained by irradiating a neutron
beam from the upper side of the MAO film. The experimental spectrum
could be closely fitted to a single-layer model. The thickness of
the MAO film obtained from our neutron reflectivity analysis is 106
nm, with roughnesses of 5.9 and 1.5 nm for the air/MAO and MAO/glass
surfaces, respectively. On the assumption that the scattering length
density of the alumina matrix was equal to that of the amorphous alumina
(5.67 × 10–6 Å–2), the
volume fraction of the pores in the MAO film was estimated to be 0.22.
When neutron reflection patterns were measured by irradiating a neutron
beam from both the film and the glass sides, the MAO film exhibited
no Bragg diffraction peaks (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure 3, only a vertical mesoscale periodicity was recognized
in the GI-SAXS pattern of the MAO film. The d-spacing
of the in-plane periodicity is 12.5 nm (Figure 3B), which is greater than the pore size observed
in the SEM top view (ca. 10 nm). We therefore conclude that the perpendicularly
oriented cylindrical pore channels are aligned within the MAO film
(Figure 4).

The neutron beam was irradiated from the film side (open circles)
and from the glass side (shaded circles). The MAO film was prepared
with a precursor solution containing 0.5 M aluminum nitrate.

Jiang et al. reported the formation of a mesoporous amorphous
aluminum
oxide film with a three-dimensional mesostructure.17,18 This mesostructure was converted to an array of vertically oriented
nanopillars during the crystallization process at high temperatures
(above 800 °C). On the other hand, the results of neutron reflection
and GI-SAXS experiments indicate that the present MAO film has perpendicularly
oriented mesopore channels without conversion of the mesostructure.

The surface charge of the inner pore surface of the MAO film was
examined by observing the adsorption of charged dyes. When the MAO/glass
substrate was immersed in the dye solution, the adsorption of negatively
charged fluorescein was recognized. In contrast, the adsorption of
positively charged methylene blue hardly took place (Figure S2A). The conventional mesoporous silica film25 with a negatively charged surface adsorbed only
the methylene blue (Figure S2B). These
results indicate a positive charge on the inner pore surface of MAO.
This desired surface charge allows efficient GOD adsorption by the
MAO film.

We immersed the MAO/glass substrate in GOD solution
(1.0 mg/mL)
at 5 °C for 20 h. After rinsing, the MAO film with GOD showed
an absorption band indicative of cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide
in GOD (Figure S3). The amount of GOD at
the MAO film was estimated, from the absorbance at 452 nm, to be 1.9
× 10–6 mol cm–3. By assuming
the volume of a single GOD molecule to be 253 nm3, the
volume fraction of GOD within the MAO film was calculated to be 0.24,
which was close to the volume fraction of pores within the MAO film
(0.22). It therefore can be concluded that GOD molecules are efficiently
adsorbed into ca. 10 nm-diameter pore channels.

The activity
of GOD within MAO was examined using the GOD/peroxidase
method. The MAO/glass substrate with GOD was immersed in 0.1 M HEPES
buffer (pH 7.0) containing 150 mM 4-aminoantipyrine, 150 mM phenol,
0.03 g/mL peroxidase, and 0–10 mM glucose. The production of
the red dye, a product of the enzymatic reaction, was monitored by
observing the time-course absorbance at 500 nm. As shown in the inset
of Figure 5, the absorbance
of the red dye increased quasi-linearly with time. The apparent Michaelis–Menten
constant, Km, derived from the time-course
measurements, was 3.76 mM (Figure 5). This value was similar to that for GOD in nanocomposite
systems: 8.26 mM for carbon nanotubes dispersed in a polymer26 and 1.4 mM for microporous titanium oxide.27 GOD within the MAO film thus can maintain a
high enzymatic activity.

the best fit of data to the Michaelis–Menten equation.

Conclusions
In the present study,
a continuous mesoporous aluminum oxide film
with perpendicularly oriented pore channels was synthesized by using
aluminum nitrate as the metal precursor. A conventional mesoporous
silica film requires surface modification with amine functional groups
for the loading of GOD into the silica mesopores because both silica
and GOD surfaces are negatively charged. In contrast, the positively
charged inner pore surface of the aluminum oxide film allowed efficient
pore loading of GOD without the surface modification. The perpendicularly
oriented cylindrical mesopore channel is favored to create an effective
biocatalytic system with an enzyme. The present mesoporous aluminum
oxide film is thus potentially useful as a rigid host material for
an enzyme toward the development of a biocatalytic system.
