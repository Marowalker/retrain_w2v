Nonelectrolyte
solubility in electrolyte solutions follow the Hofmeister
series, but the applicability of the series to salt solubility has
been less appreciated. This study, using solubility data for thirteen
sodium-bearing salts, shows that salts are consistently salted out
by electrolytes important to alkaline nuclear waste in the order NaOH
> NaCl > NaNO2 > NaNO3 at 298.15 K,
which is
the same order as the Hofmeister series. Graphical presentation allowed
for easy separation of the common ion effect (caused by the addition
of Na+) from the salting-out effect (caused by the presence
of anions) because there is a large difference between the solubility
of a given salt in different background electrolytes at a common Na+ molality. The trend persists even in very high electrolyte
concentrations where essentially all of the water molecules must be
in the coordination sphere of an ion, which means that the effect
of electrolytes on “bulk water” is not the cause of
the trend. These specific interactions more likely result from the
sharing of water molecules between ions, augmented by differences
in ion-pairing of the electrolytes. The Hofmeister series has practical
application to the management of alkaline high-level radioactive waste
created at nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities, where a predictive
understanding of salt solubility is essential for blending wastes
of disparate compositions prior to treatment.

Introduction
Aqueous electrolyte solutions are one
of the most common chemical
systems in both nature and industry. Despite extensive investigation
for more than 100 years, salt solubility in multicomponent aqueous
electrolyte solutions are still not well described theoretically except
in the most dilute solutions.1 The cause
of this difficulty is in part because of what are called “specific
interactions”,2 which are interactions
between different constituents in the solution. All ions create an
electric field in solution because they are charged. Specific interactions
are all of those thermodynamic impacts of a specific ion that are
above and beyond the impact of the electric field.

Specific
interactions are captured experimentally in popular models
of electrolyte solution thermodynamics through the activity coefficients
of the ions.3−5 Unfortunately, the current models must be parameterized
with the experimental data for concentrated solutions, which can require
substantial experimentation to capture all of the specific interactions
between all ions in systems with many components.1 While it is certainly possible to determine a large number
of interaction parameters experimentally, it is cost prohibitive in
many cases. Voigt emphasized this point with seawater.6,7 Seawater has been studied for more than 100 years, yet there is
still insufficient data to develop all of the important interaction
parameters over the whole range of salinities, temperatures, and pressures
important to chemical oceanographers.

Alkaline nuclear waste
in underground storage tanks at the Hanford
and Savannah River Sites in the United States of America is another
example of a many component aqueous system. The aqueous phase has
high concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, aluminate, hydroxide, carbonate,
phosphate, formate, acetate, chloride, fluoride, and oxalate anions
counterbalanced with sodium and lesser amounts of potassium. Sodium,
nitrate, nitrite, hydroxide, and aluminate are the most prevalent
ions.8 Thus, the other ions in the waste
possess a liquid phase with high concentrations of these electrolytes.
There are hundreds of less prevalent species in the waste. The liquid
phase is commonly saturated with four or more salts simultaneously,
and the waste solution temperatures range from approximately 15–40
°C.9 There has been some work performed
to quantify the specific interactions between ions in Hanford waste
from the available data (for instance10−13), but the data is simply unavailable
for most ions over the concentration and temperature range relevant
to Hanford waste processing.

Given the complexity of the Hanford
waste, the question is asked:
are there some trends that can be exploited to explain Hanford waste
behavior? One of the most ubiquitously used trends in electrolyte
chemistry is the Hofmeister series. In the 1880s, Hofmeister and students
(translated by ref (14)) determined that the solubility of proteins in aqueous solution
depends on the identity of other dissolved ions, and that the order
of that impact for the background ions was the same regardless of
what protein was investigated. They went on to show that water activity
and colloid stability in aqueous solution follow this same series.14

The Hofmeister series has been used extensively
in the fields of
colloid science and biophysics over the last 130 years to explain
many different phenomena in aqueous electrolyte solutions.15,16 There was also much early work on the solubility of nonelectrolytes,
showing that their solubilities in aqueous solutions follow the Hofmeister
series.17,18 These early studies showed that the solubility
of gases and organic nonelectrolytes depended on the concentration
and identity of background electrolytes; but at a given molality of
electrolytes, the relative solubility of each nonelectrolyte in each
electrolyte solution followed the trend NaNO3 > NaCl
>
NaOH.18 Those studies did not include NaNO2, but a recent study determined that the solubility of nonelectrolyte
chlorouridine 1 followed the solubility trend NaNO3 >
NaNO2 > NaCl > NaOH.19

The Hofmeister series has been studied more thoroughly for
nonelectrolyte
solubilities than salts, even though Brønsted noted nearly a
hundred years ago that the salting-out effect is much larger for salts
than most nonelectrolytes.20 Extending
the Hofmeister series to salt solubilities may provide qualitative
trends that can be used to evaluate solubilities in systems where
empirical data is unavailable. This study shows that the solubilities
of key salts in the Hanford radioactive waste follow the Hofmeister
series, at least for the electrolytes NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH. This trend can be used to constrain the magnitude
of specific interactions between other ions in the waste and these
four ions.

Methods
As noted earlier, this work seeks to answer
the question “do
the relative solubility of salts in aqueous solutions containing NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH follow a trend similar
to the Hofmeister series?” The Hofmeister series for nonelectrolytes
in aqueous solutions of these background electrolytes follows the
trend NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl > NaOH,
so this study
hypothesizes that the relative solubility of salts in these electrolytes
would follow this same trend. The salts that are evaluated are NaF,
Na2MoO4, NaBr, NaBrO3, Na2C2O4, NaHCO3, Na2WO4, NaIO3, Na3PO4, and Na2SO4. This study will also evaluate the solubilities
of NaNO3, NaNO2, and NaCl themselves. Highly
hydrated salts, such as Na2CO3·10H20 or Na2SO4·10H2O, were
not included in this study because their solubilities are highly dependent
on the water activity (to the 10th power), so the impact of the background
electrolytes on water activity confounds the relative impacts of specific
interactions.

Graphical analysis is the primary tool used here
to determine the
relative solubility of the target salt as a function of sodium concentration
because the trends are so readily apparent graphically. Data from
the literature were used to generate these graphs, most commonly from
the compilation by Silcock21 because it
has a large amount of data reported in consistent concentration units.
When data important to the Hanford waste were unavailable in Silcock,21 a literature review was conducted in an attempt
to locate the data. Solubilities were evaluated at 25 °C because
this temperature had the most solubility data for the target electrolytes.

Results
In the electrolyte chemistry literature, it is rare to hear of
a salt described as being “salted out” by another electrolyte.
Terms like “salting-out” are more commonly applied to
the solubility of nonelectrolytes. The effect of electrolytes on the
solubility of salts is described by the common ion effect in which
the background electrolyte contains an ion in common with the salt
that suppresses the salt solubility. The common ion effect is readily
seen in Figure 1, which
shows the solubility of NaF in aqueous solutions of NaNO3. Sodium fluoride salt is frequently present in the Hanford waste.27 The solubility of NaF in pure water is about
0.987 m at 25 °C.24 Therefore, the lowest sodium and highest fluoride concentration
in Figure 1 is 0.987 m because NaF salt breaks up into one sodium ion and one
fluoride ion during dissolution via the following reaction 1  

Figure 1 Solubility of NaF in electrolyte solutions (data
from refs22−26).

When Na+ is added to
a saturated solution of NaF, the
fluoride concentration is suppressed by the common ion effect; that
is, the concentration of fluoride decreases with increasing sodium
added as NaNO3 (Figure 1). What the common ion effect cannot explain is the
nearly complete independence of fluoride concentration on sodium concentration
between about 5 and 10 m Na+ (Figure 1). This effect is
caused by specific interactions that are captured in models such as
that of Pitzer.13Figure 1 also shows the solubility of NaF in NaCl
media, and all three data points are replicates of each other (two
by ref (25) and one
by ref (26)), although
with significant scatter in the result. Despite the scatter, all three
replicates in NaCl media exhibit lower solubility than in NaNO3 media at the same sodium molality. This indicates that there
is likely some difference in the solubility of NaF in nitrate media
compared with chloride media, indicating some specific interaction
from nitrate and chloride. This was recognized by Brønsted20 nearly 100 years ago, but we have found no discussion
in the literature of the consistent relative ability of different
background electrolytes to “salt-out” a large variety
of salts.

A broader comparison of the solubility of the salts
in different
electrolytes is required to make a trend of specific ion effects self-evident.
Therefore, sodium molybdate is investigated because much more data
is available than for NaF at 25 °C. Sodium molybdate salt Na2MoO4·2H2O is relatively soluble
in pure water at ambient temperatures, dissolving via the following
reaction 2  

Once the sodium molybdate concentration
in solution is large enough
to reach saturation, any sodium added from another electrolyte should
drive the equilibrium to the left in eq 2, suppressing the molybdate concentration. This is
illustrated in Figure 2, where the solubility of sodium molybdate is increasingly suppressed
as NaNO3, NaNO2, or NaCl are added (data from
refs21,28,29). Figure 2 demonstrates that
it greatly matters which anion is added with the sodium, with the
solubility of sodium molybdate being much higher in NaNO3 solutions than NaCl solutions of the same total sodium molality,
illustrating the “specific interactions” between ions
in this system.2,20 Adding 0.9 mol of NaCl per kg
of water to a solution of Na2MoO4 at saturation
can precipitate more sodium as Na2MoO4·2H2O salt than sodium added as NaCl (Figure 2). Figure 2 also shows that the solubility of Na2MoO4·2H2O in NaNO2 solutions is between
that of NaNO3 and NaCl, with the exception of one stray
data point. This relative impact of these electrolytes (NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl) on Na2MoO4·2H2O solubility is the same as the relative impact
of these same
electrolytes on the solubility of neutral organic molecules as predicted
by the Hofmeister series.19

Figure 2 Solubility of sodium
molybdate in aqueous solutions of NaNO3, NaNO2, and NaCl at 298.15 K (data from refs21,28,29).

Na2MoO4·2H2O is a hydrated
salt, having two water molecules in its crystal structure.30 Therefore, the solubility would to depend on
the water activity (to the second power) in addition to the sodium
molality per eq 2. Thus,
we need to ensure that the impact of different electrolytes on the
solubility of Na2MoO4·2H2O observed
in Figure 2 is not
solely caused by the effects of the background electrolyte on water
activity.

The impact of water activity on the solubility of
the salt can
be observed in the equilibrium expression for hydrated salts, here
using Na2MoO4·2H2O as an example. 3a  Here, K is the equilibrium
constant, and the parentheses denote activities of the species inside.
This can be solved for the molybdenum activity (a function of the
concentration) to put it on the same basis as Figure 2. 3b  

The activity of water appears in the
denominator of eq 3a,
so an increase in water activity
should result in a decrease in the molybdate concentration. Therefore,
any background electrolyte that changes the water activity must change
the solubility of the salt. The background electrolyte with the highest
water activity at a given sodium molality should decrease the solubility
of Na2MoO4·2H2O the most, if
the water activity were the only way that the anion was affecting
the solubility. Figure 3 shows the water activity as a function of sodium molality for background
electrolytes in this study, demonstrating that the water activity
is always NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl over the
entire
sodium molality range. This is the same order as the impact of the
electrolytes on the solubility, but it is the exact opposite of the
effect expected if their impact on the water activity were the only
cause of the different solubilities in different electrolytes. Thus,
the impact of the electrolytes on Na2MoO4·2H2O solubility is due to specific interactions rather than their
impact on the water activity. Indeed, the impact of the specific interactions
overcomes their impact on the water activity.

Figure 3 Water activity as a function
of sodium molarity in aqueous solutions
of NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH (data from refs31−34).

The relative impact of NaNO3, NaNO2, and
NaCl on the solubility of Na2MoO4·2H2O as well as the impact of NaNO3 versus NaCl on
NaF solubility is consistent with the Hofmeister series for these
three background electrolytes. These results show the salting-out
effect of the background electrolytes and show they are different
from the common ion effect. These, however, are just two salts, with
very limited data, and there are no data at 25 °C for either
of them in aqueous NaOH solutions. Thus, the next section will look
at a broader set of salts.

Other Salts
The solubility of NaCl
is available in NaNO3, NaNO2, and NaOH solutions,
whereas NaBr solubility is only available
in NaNO3 and NaOH solutions. Figures 4 and 5 plots these
solubilities. Individually, NaCl and NaBr are consistently more soluble
in NaNO3 solutions than NaOH solutions at the same sodium
molality (Figures 4 and 5). The solubility of NaCl at constant
sodium molality follows the trend NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaOH (Figure 4).

Figure 4 NaCl solubility in aqueous solutions of NaNO3, NaNO2, or NaOH (data from refs35−38).

Figure 5 Solubility of NaBr in aqueous solutions of NaNO3 and
NaOH (data from ref (21)).

Figures 6 and 7 show that the
oxyhalides NaBrO3 and
NaIO3 are always more soluble in NaNO3 solution
than in NaCl solution at the same sodium molality. Solubility data
in NaNO2 and NaOH solutions are unavailable for these oxyhalides.

Figure 6 Solubility
of NaBrO3 in aqueous solutions of NaNO3 and
NaCl (data from ref (21)).

Figure 7 Solubility of NaIO3 in aqueous solutions
of NaNO3 and NaCl (data from ref (21)).

The salts with divalent anions Na2WO4 and
Na2SO4 (Figures 8 and 9) show trends similar
to the previous salts investigated. Hence, Na2WO4 is always more soluble in NaNO3 than in NaNO2, and anhydrous Na2SO4 solubility follows the
trend NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaOH over the entire
sodium
molality range (Figures 8 and 9). Note that NaCl is not included in Figure 9 because NaCl is
not soluble enough to reduce the water activity enough to precipitate
anhydrous Na2SO4 at 25 °C, Na2SO4·10H2O precipitates instead.21

Figure 8 Solubility of Na2WO4 in aqueous
solutions
of NaNO3 and NaNO2 (data from refs (39) and (40)).

Figure 9 Solubility of Na2SO4 in aqueous solutions
of NaNO3, NaNO2, and NaOH (data from refs41−43).

The solubility of Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O follows the trend
NaNO3 > NaNO2 >
NaCl > NaOH like other salts (with the exception of a couple of
stray
data points) but has an interesting feature (Figure 10). As noted earlier, highly hydrated salts
such as Na2SO4·10H2O or Na2CO3·10H2O were not considered in
this study because the impact of the background electrolyte on solubility
through the water activity obscured the specific interactions. Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O has 12
waters of hydration, so its solubility should be proportional to the
water activity to the 12th power. The impact of the background electrolytes
on the water activity should thus have an enormous impact on the solubility
of Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O by influence on the water activity. Nonetheless, the impact of
the specific interactions between phosphate and the background electrolytes
is apparently even greater because the relative impact of NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH on Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O solubility is the exact
opposite of their impacts via the water activity (Figure 3).

Figure 10 Solubility of Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O in aqueous
solutions of NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH (data
from refs44−47).

The solubility of NaHCO3 is higher in NaNO2 than in NaCl solutions (Figure 11). Sodium bicarbonate
is not stable in NaOH solutions,
so the impact of NaOH on NaHCO3 solubility cannot be evaluated.
Sodium oxalate also follows the solubility trend NaNO3 >
NaCl > NaOH at a given sodium molality (Figure 12).

Figure 11 Solubility of NaHCO3 in aqueous
solutions of NaNO2 and NaCl (data from ref (21)).

Figure 12 Solubility of Na2C2O4 in aqueous
solutions of NaNO3, NaCl, and NaOH (data from refs (48) and (49)).

The data on the solubility of NaNO3 and NaNO2 in the other background electrolytes is consistent with the
trend
NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl > NaOH (Figures 13 and 14), which in turn is consistent with the Hofmeister
series for the
impact of these background electrolytes on nonelectrolyte organic
molecules.

Figure 13 Solubility of NaNO2 in aqueous solutions of
NaNO3, NaCl, and NaOH (data from refs36,50,51).

Figure 14 Solubility of NaNO3 in aqueous
solutions of NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH (data from refs37,50,51).

Here, the solubilities of 13 salts
followed the Hofmeister series
NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl > NaOH over the
entire
composition region, with the exception of only a few stray data points.
While only one salt could be investigated in all four background electrolytes
(Na3PO4·0.25NaOH·12H2O),
all salts followed this trend with the data available. Thus, it can
be concluded that the solubility of sodium salts in these background
electrolytes can usually be expected to follow the Hofmeister series
for at least these four background electrolytes.

Discussion
The
Hofmeister series has long been associated with the ion size
and charge, where “salting-out” of a nonelectrolyte
by smaller ions is greater than that by larger ions of the same charge
(Grover and Ryall, 2005).52 The impact
of the electrolytes on the solubility of salts here is also in the
same order of their ionic radius, where hydroxide with the shortest
radius salts out more than nitrate with the longest radius.53

Thermodynamically, when background electrolytes
influence the solubility
of another salt, they must either change the activity coefficients
of the dissolved species or change the concentration of free sodium
ion by forming ion pairs. The ion pairing would decrease the free
Na+ concentration because adding the background electrolyte
would form an ion pair instead of completely dissociating into ions.
Recent solubility models for sodium oxalate and sodium sulfate have
combined ion pairing of the background electrolyte with impacts on
activity coefficients.10−12 However, salt-electrolyte systems can be modeled
just as well by adding terms to the interaction factors between the
ions rather than including ion pairing in the model.54 Indeed, one of the main reasons that the present study
used graphical analysis rather than models to show the trends is that
there are so many interrelated empirically determined parameters in
most electrolyte thermodynamic models. This makes it difficult to
associate the parameters with underlying physical processes.1

There is a correlation between the polarizability
of the ions and
their position in the Hofmeister series in dilute solutions.55 Early researchers explained the Hofmeister series
by assuming the background electrolytes have an electrostatic effect
of the ions on the bulk water.52 There
has been much debate in the literature concerning the impact of dissolved
ions on the water molecules beyond the ion’s coordination sphere,
with the current evidence indicating that there is minimal long-range
effect of monovalent ions on the structure of water.56−58 Nonetheless, such electrostatic effects on “bulk”
water would never have been operative in the highly concentrated systems
studied here. Here, the Hofmeister effect was clearly evident even
when the electrolyte concentration was over 6 m,
where little “bulk” water remains because all of the
water molecules are in the ions’ inner coordination spheres.57 Indeed, the specific interactions tended to
be highest at the highest electrolyte concentrations.

The quantity
of “bulk water” can be estimated from
the number of water molecules in the ion coordination spheres as determined
by diffraction methods. Diffraction data indicates that sodium, nitrate,
nitrite, and chloride all have approximately six coordinating water
molecules, whereas hydroxide has five.59−66 These coordinating water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the
ions.63−68 With 55.5 mol of water per kilogram and six water molecules per
ion, a solution with more than 9.25 mol of ions per kilogram water
(or 4.63 mol of fully dissociated monovalent electrolyte) does not
have enough water to provide each ion with six water molecules without
sharing. This means that in a solution with greater than 4.63 m of 1:1 electrolyte (or 5.05 m for NaOH),
the ions are either not fully dissociated, or the ions must be sharing
at least some water molecules with each other. It seems logical that
the hydrogen bond between water and an ion will have at least some
effect on the ability of the same water molecule to simultaneously
form a hydrogen bond with another ion. Therefore, the effect of ions
on the solubility of other ions in concentrated solutions is likely
related to how they impact water’s ability to form hydrogen
bonds with neighboring ions. Indeed, the order of the Hofmeister series
for anions is the same as their relative ability to accept hydrogen
bonds.69 This is consistent with the recent
work that has correlated the Hofmeister series with the impact of
the ions on hydrogen bonds in the hydration shell.70−72

There
are many potential practical applications of this trend.
One potential use is to estimate coefficients for more complicated
thermodynamic models. There was only one salt evaluated here that
had solubility data available in all four electrolytes, and solubility
data are most commonly used to parameterize the liquid phase interaction
factors in most thermodynamic models.4 Consequently,
it is not possible to determine interaction factors between all ions
in this study. Nonetheless, the data that are available can constrain
the solubility in background electrolytes, where no other data are
available. For instance, data on the solubility of Na2C2O4 in aqueous solutions of NaNO2 are
unavailable, but the Hofmeister series here indicates that the solubility
of Na2C2O4 in aqueous NaNO2 solutions is going to lie somewhere between its solubility in NaCl
and NaNO3 solutions. Fitting the NaNO2 interaction
factors to Na2C2O4 solubility in
NaCl or NaNO3 will not be as accurate as fitting to the
actual data in NaNO2 solutions, but it would be more accurate
than assuming no interaction at all.

While NaNO3,
NaNO2, NaCl, and NaOH are all
major electrolytes in the Hanford waste, another major dissolved electrolyte
in the Hanford waste is sodium aluminate [NaAl(OH)4].73 Sodium aluminate was not included as a background
electrolyte in this study because it is only stable in the presence
of NaOH, which confounds the interpretation of the data, and because
very few data exist on the solubility of salts in sodium aluminate
solutions. Sodium aluminate is likely higher on the Hofmeister series
(i.e. less precipitating) than NaOH because the location in the Hofmeister
series is correlated with the impact of the electrolyte on water activity
(Figure 2)14 and the water activity of NaOH/NaAl(OH)4 mixtures is higher than NaOH at the same sodium molality.74

Given the data presented here, showing
that salt solubility follows
the Hofmeister series for model systems, can the same trend be applied
to complex Hanford waste? Assuming that (1) the most important specific
interactions in the Hanford waste are from the major electrolytes
NaNO3, NaNO2, NaCl, NaAl(OH)4, and
NaOH and (2) the location of NaAl(OH)4 on the Hofmeister
series is somewhere between NaOH and NaNO3, the solubility
of salts in the Hanford waste should always lie somewhere between
their solubilities in simple NaOH and NaNO3 aqueous solutions.
Historic Hanford Site waste characterization data can be used to test
this assumption. Sodium oxalate had a relatively narrow solubility
spread between background electrolytes, whereas NaNO3 had
a very wide spread (Figures 12 and 14). Consequently, these two electrolytes
are evaluated in real nuclear waste as the two more extreme cases.

The real waste data used in this evaluation was taken from the
Hanford Site tank farms characterization database called Tank Waste
Inventory Network System (TWINS). Data for wastes that are known to
have solid sodium oxalate were used. These data are compared to data
in just NaNO3 and NaOH aqueous solutions in Figure 15. The plot shows that the
majority of the actual waste data falls between the solubility in
aqueous NaNO3 and in NaOH solutions, though two data points
are slightly outside. Nonetheless, even these two data points are
just barely outside, so for practical purposes, the solubility of
sodium oxalate in alkaline tank waste can be assumed to be between
its solubility in NaNO3 and NaOH solutions.

Figure 15 Comparison
of Na2C2O solubility in the Hanford
waste to simple NaNO3 and NaOH solutions (data from TWINS
database as well as refs (48) and (49)).

Unlike sodium oxalate, there is
a large difference in sodium nitrate
solubility in different background electrolytes. Sodium nitrate is
3–4 times more soluble in NaNO2 solutions than NaOH
solutions at the same sodium molality (Figure 14). Liquid phase concentrations of sodium
and nitrate were collected from the TWINS database for samples that
are known to have solid phase NaNO3 in them (and thus are
likely at saturation with NaNO3). These data are plotted
in Figure 16, showing
that the real waste data are in-between the solubilities of NaNO3 in pure aqueous solutions of NaNO2 and NaOH. These
results indicate that the Hofmeister series can be used to explain
the order of solubility for salts of interest in the Hanford waste.

of NaNO3 solubility in the Hanford waste
to simple NaNO2 and NaOH solutions (data from TWINS database
as well as refs (50) and (51)).

Conclusions
While the specific interactions
ordered by the Hofmeister series
have long been associated with the nonelectrolyte solubility and with
the coagulation of colloids and biomolecules, this study shows it
is equally applicable to the “salting-out” of salts
as well. The distinction between specific interactions caused by the
anions and the common ion effect could be readily seen by plotting
the solubility of a given salt as a function of sodium molality for
different electrolytes. The solubility of the salts at constant total
sodium molality always followed the relative order NaNO3 > NaNO2 > NaCl > NaOH for the four background
electrolytes
studied here. This trend can be used to explain the salt solubility
behavior in many-component alkaline nuclear waste as demonstrated
here for Na2C2O4 and NaNO3.
